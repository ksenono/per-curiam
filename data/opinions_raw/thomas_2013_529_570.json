ERIC H.\nHOLDER, Jr., ATTORNEY GENERAL, et\u00a0al.on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the district of columbia circuit[June 25, 2013]Justice Thomas,\nconcurring.I join the\nCourt\u2019s opinion in full but write separately to explain that\nI would find \u00a75 of the Voting Rights Act unconstitutional as\nwell. The Court\u2019s opinion sets forth the reasons.\u201cThe Voting\nRights Act of 1965 employed extraordinary measures to address an\nextraordinary problem.\u201d Ante, at 1. In the face of\n\u201cunremitting and ingenious defiance\u201d of citizens\u2019\nconstitutionally protected right to vote, \u00a75 was necessary to\ngive effect to the Fifteenth Amendment in particular regions of the\ncountry. South Carolina v. Katzen-bach, 383 U.\u00a0S. 301, 309\n(1966) . Though \u00a75\u2019s preclear- ance requirement\nrepresented a \u201cshar[p] depart[ure]\u201d from \u201cbasic\nprinciples\u201d of federalism and the equal sovereignty of the\nStates, ante, at 9, 11, the Court upheld the measure against early\nconstitutional challenges because it was necessary at the time to\naddress \u201cvoting discrimination where it persist[ed] on a\npervasive scale.\u201d Katzenbach, supra, at 308.Today, our Nation has\nchanged. \u201c[T]he conditions that originally justified\n[\u00a75] no longer characterize voting in the covered\njurisdictions.\u201d Ante, at 2. As the Court explains:\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018[V]oter turnout and registration rates now\napproach parity. Blatantly discriminatory evasions of federal\ndecrees are rare. And minority candidates hold office at\nun-precedented levels.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Ante, at 13\u201314\n(quoting Northwest Austin Municipal Util. Dist. No. One v. Holder,\n557 U.\u00a0S. 193, 202 (2009) ).In spite of these\nimprovements, however, Congress increased the already significant\nburdens of \u00a75. Following its reenactment in 2006, the Voting\nRights Act was amended to \u201cprohibit more conduct than\nbefore.\u201d Ante, at 5. \u201cSection 5 now forbids voting\nchanges with \u2018any dis-criminatory purpose\u2019 as well as\nvoting changes that diminish the ability of citizens, on account of\nrace, color, or language minority status, \u2018to elect their\npreferred candidates of choice.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Ante, at 6.\nWhile the pre-2006 version of the Act went well beyond protection\nguaranteed under the Constitution, see Reno v. Bossier Parish\nSchool Bd., 520 U.\u00a0S. 471 \u2013482 (1997), it now goes even\nfurther.It is, thus, quite\nfitting that the Court repeatedly points out that this legislation\nis \u201cextraordinary\u201d and \u201cunprecedented\u201d and\nrecognizes the significant constitutional problems created by\nCongress\u2019 decision to raise \u201cthe bar that covered\njurisdictions must clear,\u201d even as \u201cthe conditions\njustifying that requirement have dramatically improved.\u201d\nAnte, at 16\u201317. However one aggregates the data compiled by\nCongress, it cannot justify the considerable burdens created by\n\u00a75. As the Court aptly notes: \u201c[N]o one can fairly say\nthat [the record] shows anything approaching the\n\u2018pervasive,\u2019 \u2018flagrant,\u2019\n\u2018widespread,\u2019 and \u2018rampant\u2019 discrimination\nthat faced Congress in 1965, and that clearly distinguished the\ncovered jurisdictions from the rest of the Nation at that\ntime.\u201d Ante, at 21. Indeed, circumstances in the covered\njurisdictions can no longer be characterized as\n\u201cexceptional\u201d or \u201cunique.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cThe\nextensive pattern of discrimination that led the Court to\npreviously uphold \u00a75 as enforcing the Fifteenth Amendment no\nlonger exists.\u201d Northwest Austin, supra, at 226 (Thomas, J.,\nconcurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part). Section 5\nis, thus, unconstitutional.While the Court claims\nto \u201cissue no holding on \u00a75 itself,\u201d ante, at 24,\nits own opinion compellingly demonstrates that Congress has failed\nto justify \u201c\u00a0\u2018current burdens\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nwith a record demonstrating \u201c\u00a0\u2018current\nneeds.\u2019\u00a0\u201d See ante, at 9 (quoting Northwest\nAustin, supra, at 203). By leaving the inevitable conclusion\nunstated, the Court needlessly prolongs the demise of that\nprovision. For the reasons stated in the Court\u2019s opinion, I\nwould find \u00a75 unconstitutional.",
