But like most laws, this\none bears its qualifications. Among other things, \u00a71 says that\n\u201cnothing herein\u201d may be used to compel arbitration in disputes\ninvolving the \u201ccontracts of employment\u201d of certain transportation\nworkers. 9 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71. And that qualification has\nsparked these questions: When a contract delegates questions of\narbitrability to an arbitrator, must a court leave disputes over\nthe application of \u00a71\u2019s exception for the arbitrator to resolve?\nAnd does the term \u201ccontracts of employment\u201d refer only to contracts\nbetween employers and employees, or does it also reach contracts\nwith independent contractors? Because courts across the country\nhave disagreed on the answers to these questions, we took this case\nto resolve them.INew Prime is an interstate trucking company\nand Dominic Oliveira works as one of its drivers. But, at least on\npaper, Mr. Oliveira isn\u2019t an employee; the parties\u2019 contracts label\nhim an independent contractor. Those agreements also instruct that\nany disputes arising out of the parties\u2019 relationship should be\nresolved by an arbitrator\u2014even disputes over the scope of the\narbitrator\u2019s authority.Eventually, of course, a dispute did arise. In a\nclass action lawsuit in federal court, Mr. Oliveira argued that New\nPrime denies its drivers lawful wages. The company may call its\ndrivers independent contractors. But, Mr. Oliveira alleged, in\nreality New Prime treats them as employees and fails to pay the\nstatutorily due minimum wage. In response to Mr. Oliveira\u2019s\ncomplaint, New Prime asked the court to invoke its statutory\nauthority under the Act and compel arbitration according to the\nterms found in the parties\u2019 agreements.That request led to more than a little\nlitigation of its own. Even when the parties\u2019 contracts mandate\narbitration, Mr. Oliveira observed, the Act doesn\u2019talwaysauthorize a court to enter an order compelling it. In particular,\n\u00a71 carves out from the Act\u2019s coverage \u201ccontracts of employment of\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. workers engaged in foreign or interstate commerce.\u201d\nAnd at least for purposes of this collateral dispute, Mr. Oliveira\nsubmitted, it doesn\u2019t matter whether you view him as an employee or\nindependent contractor. Either way, his agreement to drive trucks\nfor New Prime qualifies as a \u201ccontract[\u00a0] of employment of\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. [a] worker[\u00a0] engaged in .\u00a0.\u00a0.\ninterstate commerce.\u201d Accordingly, Mr. Oliveira argued, the Act\nsupplied the district court with no authority to compel arbitration\nin this case.Naturally, New Prime disagreed. Given the\nextraordinary breadth of the parties\u2019 arbitration agreement, the\ncompany insisted that any question about \u00a71\u2019s application belonged\nfor the arbitrator alone to resolve. Alternatively and assuming a\ncourt could address the question, New Prime contended that the term\n\u201ccontracts of employment\u201d refers only to contracts that establish\nan employer-employee relationship. And because Mr. Oliveira is, in\nfact as well as form, an independent contractor, the company\nargued, \u00a71\u2019s exception doesn\u2019t apply; the rest of the statute does;\nand the district court was (once again) required to order\narbitration.Ultimately, the district court and the First\nCircuit sided with Mr. Oliveira. 857 F.3d 7 (2017). The court of\nappeals held, first, that in disputes like this a court should\nresolve whether the parties\u2019 contract falls within the Act\u2019s ambit\nor \u00a71\u2019s exclusion before invoking the statute\u2019s authority to order\narbitration. Second, the court of appeals held that \u00a71\u2019s exclusion\nof certain \u201ccontracts of employment\u201d removes from the Act\u2019s\ncoverage not only employer-employee contracts but also contracts\ninvolving independent contractors. So under any account of the\nparties\u2019 agreement in this case, the court held, it lacked\nauthority under the Act to order arbitration.IIIn approaching the first question for\nourselves, one thing becomes clear immediately. While a court\u2019s\nauthority under the Arbitration Act to compel arbitration may be\nconsiderable, it isn\u2019t unconditional. If two parties agree to\narbitrate future disputes between them and one side later seeks to\nevade the deal, \u00a7\u00a73 and 4 of the Act often require a court to stay\nlitigation and compel arbitration \u201caccord[ing to] the terms\u201d of the\nparties\u2019 agreement. But this authority doesn\u2019t extend toallprivate contracts, no matter how emphatically they may express a\npreference for arbitration.Instead, antecedent statutory provisions limit\nthe scope of the court\u2019s powers under \u00a7\u00a73 and 4. Section 2 provides\nthat the Act applies only when the parties\u2019 agreement to arbitrate\nis set forth as a \u201cwritten provision in any maritime transaction or\na contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce.\u201d And \u00a71\nhelps define \u00a72\u2019s terms. Most relevant for our purposes, \u00a71 warns\nthat \u201cnothing\u201d in the Act \u201cshall apply\u201d to \u201ccontracts of employment\nof seamen, railroad employees, or any other class of workers\nengaged in foreign or interstate commerce.\u201d Why this very\nparticular qualification? By the time it adopted the Arbitration\nAct in 1925, Congress had already prescribed alternative employment\ndispute resolution regimes for many transportation workers. And it\nseems Congress \u201cdid not wish to unsettle\u201d those arrangements in\nfavor of whatever arbitration procedures the parties\u2019 private\ncontracts might happen to contemplate.Circuit City Stores,Inc.v.Adams,532 U.S.\n105, 121 (2001).Given the statute\u2019s terms and sequencing, we\nagree with the First Circuit that a court should decide for itself\nwhether \u00a71\u2019s \u201ccontracts of employment\u201d exclusion applies before\nordering arbitration. After all, to invoke its statutory powers\nunder \u00a7\u00a73 and 4 to stay litigation and compel arbitration according\nto a contract\u2019s terms, a court must first know whether the contract\nitself falls within or beyond the boundaries of \u00a7\u00a71 and 2. The\nparties\u2019 private agreement may be crystal clear and require\narbitration of every question under the sun, but that does not\nnecessarily mean the Act authorizes a court to stay litigation and\nsend the parties to an arbitral forum.Nothing in our holding on this score should come\nas a surprise. We\u2019ve long stressed the significance of the\nstatute\u2019s sequencing. InBernhardtv.Polygraphic Co. of\nAmerica,350 U.S.\n198, 201\u2013202 (1956), we recognized that \u201cSections 1, 2, and 3\n[and 4] are integral parts of a whole.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\n[Sections] 1 and 2 define the field in which Congress was\nlegislating,\u201d and \u00a7\u00a73 and 4 apply only to contracts covered by\nthose provisions. InCircuit City, we acknowledged that\n\u201cSection 1 exempts from the [Act] .\u00a0.\u00a0. contracts of\nemployment of transportation workers.\u201d 532 U.\u00a0S., at 119. And\ninSouthland Corp.v.Keating,465 U.S.\n1, 10\u201311, and n.\u00a05 (1984), we noted that \u201cthe\nenforceability of arbitration provisions\u201d under \u00a7\u00a73 and 4 depends\non whether those provisions are \u201cpart of a written maritime\ncontract or a contract \u2018evidencing a transaction involving\ncommerce\u2019\u00a0\u201d under \u00a72\u2014which, in turn, depends on the\napplication of \u00a71\u2019s exception for certain \u201ccontracts of\nemployment.\u201dTo be sure, New Prime resists this\nstraightforward understanding. The company argues that an\narbitrator should resolve any dispute over \u00a71\u2019s application because\nof the \u201cdelegation clause\u201d in the parties\u2019 contract and what is\nsometimes called the \u201cseverability principle.\u201d A delegation clause\ngives an arbitrator authority to decide even the initial question\nwhether the parties\u2019 dispute is subject to arbitration.Rent-A-Center,West,Inc.v.Jackson,561 U.S.\n63, 68\u201369 (2010). And under the severability principle, we\ntreat a challenge to the validity of an arbitration agreement (or a\ndelegation clause) separately from a challenge to the validity of\nthe entire contract in which it appears.Id., at 70\u201371.\nUnless a party specifically challenges the validity of the\nagreement to arbitrate, both sides may be required to take all\ntheir disputes\u2014including disputes about the validity of their\nbroader contract\u2014to arbitration.Ibid.Applying these\nprinciples to this case, New Prime notes that Mr. Oliveira has not\nspecifically challenged the parties\u2019 delegation clause and submits\nthat any controversy should therefore proceed only and immediately\nbefore an arbitrator.But all this overlooks the necessarily\nantecedent statutory inquiry we\u2019ve just discussed. A delegation\nclause is merely a specialized type of arbitration agreement, and\nthe Act \u201coperates on this additional arbitration agreement just as\nit does on any other.\u201dId., at 70. So a court may use \u00a7\u00a73\nand 4 to enforce a delegation clause only if the clause appears in\na \u201cwritten provision in .\u00a0.\u00a0. a contract evidencing a\ntransaction involving commerce\u201d consistent with \u00a72. And only if the\ncontract in which the clause appears doesn\u2019t trigger \u00a71\u2019s\n\u201ccontracts of employment\u201d exception. In exactly the same way, the\nAct\u2019s severability principle applies only if the parties\u2019\narbitration agreement appears in a contract that falls within the\nfield \u00a7\u00a71 and 2 describe. We acknowledged as much some time ago,\nexplaining that, before invoking the severability principle, a\ncourt should \u201cdetermine[\u00a0] that the contract in question is\nwithin the coverage of the Arbitration Act.\u201dPrima Paint\nCorp.v.Flood & Conklin Mfg. Co.,388 U.S.\n395, 402 (1967).IIIThat takes us to the second question: Did the\nFirst Circuit correctly resolve the merits of the \u00a71 challenge in\nthis case? Recall that \u00a71 excludes from the Act\u2019s compass\n\u201ccontracts of employment of .\u00a0.\u00a0. workers engaged in\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. interstate commerce.\u201d Happily, everyone before us\nagrees that Mr. Oliveira qualifies as a \u201cworker[\u00a0] engaged in\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. interstate commerce.\u201d For purposes of this appeal,\ntoo, Mr. Oliveira is willing to assume (but not grant) that his\ncontracts with New Prime establish only an independent contractor\nrelationship.With that, the disputed question comes into\nclear view: What does the term \u201ccontracts of employment\u201d mean? If\nit refers only to contracts that reflect an employer-employee\nrelationship, then \u00a71\u2019s exception is irrelevant and a court is free\nto order arbitration, just as New Prime urges. But if the termalsoencompasses contracts that require an independent\ncontractor to perform work, then the exception takes hold and a\ncourt lacks authority under the Act to order arbitration, exactly\nas Mr. Oliveira argues.AIn taking up this question, we bear an\nimportant caution in mind. \u201c[I]t\u2019s a \u2018fundamental canon of\nstatutory construction\u2019 that words generally should be \u2018interpreted\nas taking their ordinary .\u00a0.\u00a0. meaning .\u00a0.\u00a0. at\nthe time Congress enacted the statute.\u2019\u00a0\u201dWisconsin Central\nLtd.v.United States, 585 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2018)\n(slip op., at 9) (quotingPerrinv.United States,444 U.S.\n37, 42 (1979)). See alsoSandiferv.United States\nSteel Corp., 571 U.S. 220, 227 (2014). After all, if judges\ncould freely invest old statutory terms with new meanings, we would\nrisk amending legislation outside the \u201csingle, finely wrought and\nexhaustively considered, procedure\u201d the Constitution commands.INSv.Chadha,462 U.S.\n919, 951 (1983). We would risk, too, upsetting reliance\ninterests in the settled meaning of a statute. Cf. 2B N. Singer\n& J. Singer, Sutherland on Statutes and Statutory Construction\n\u00a756A:3 (rev. 7th ed. 2012). Of course, statutes may sometimes refer\nto an external source of law and fairly warn readers that they must\nabide that external source of law, later amendments and\nmodifications included.Id., \u00a751:8 (discussing the reference\ncanon). But nothing like that exists here. Nor has anyone suggested\nany other appropriate reason that might allow us to depart from the\noriginal meaning of the statute at hand.That, we think, holds the key to the case. To\nmany lawyerly ears today, the term \u201ccontracts of employment\u201d might\ncall to mind only agreements between employers and employees (or\nwhat the common law sometimes called masters and servants).\nSuggestively, at least one recently published law dictionary\ndefines the word \u201cemployment\u201d to mean \u201cthe relationship between\nmaster and servant.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 641 (10th ed. 2014).\nBut this modern intuition isn\u2019t easily squared with evidence of the\nterm\u2019s meaning at the time of the Act\u2019s adoption in 1925. At that\ntime, a \u201ccontract of employment\u201d usually meant nothing more than an\nagreement to perform work. As a result, most people then would have\nunderstood \u00a71 to exclude not only agreements between employers and\nemployees but also agreements that require independent contractors\nto perform work.What\u2019s the evidence to support this conclusion?\nIt turns out that in 1925 the term \u201ccontract of employment\u201d wasn\u2019t\ndefined in any of the (many) popular or legal dictionaries the\nparties cite to us. And surely that\u2019s a first hint the phrase\nwasn\u2019t then a term of art bearing some specialized meaning. It\nturns out, too, that the dictionaries of the era consistently\nafforded the word \u201cemployment\u201d a broad construction, broader than\nmay be often found in dictionaries today. Back then, dictionaries\ntended to treat \u201cemployment\u201d more or less as a synonym for \u201cwork.\u201d\nNor did they distinguish between different kinds of work or\nworkers: All work was treated as employment, whether or not the\ncommon law criteria for a master-servant relationship happened to\nbe satisfied.[1]What the dictionaries suggest, legal authorities\nconfirm. This Court\u2019s early 20th-century cases used the phrase\n\u201ccontract of employment\u201d to describe work agreements involving\nindependent contractors.[2]\nMany state court cases did the same.[3] So did a variety of federal statutes.[4] And state statutes too.[5] We see here no evidence that a \u201ccontract\nof employment\u201d necessarily signaled a formal employer-employee or\nmaster-servant relationship.More confirmation yet comes from a neighboring\nterm in the statutory text. Recall that the Act excludes from its\ncoverage \u201ccontracts of employment of .\u00a0.\u00a0. any\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. class ofworkersengaged in foreign or\ninterstate commerce.\u201d 9 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71 (emphasis added).\nNotice Congress didn\u2019t use the word \u201cemployees\u201d or \u201cservants,\u201d the\nnatural choices if the term \u201ccontracts of employment\u201d addressed\nthem alone. Instead, Congress spoke of \u201cworkers,\u201d a term that\neveryone agrees easily embraces independent contractors. That word\nchoice may not mean everything, but it does supply further evidence\nstill that Congress used the term \u201ccontracts of employment\u201d in a\nbroad sense to capture any contract for the performance ofworkbyworkers.BWhat does New Prime have to say about the case\nbuilding against it? Mainly, it seeks to shift the debate from the\nterm \u201ccontracts of employment\u201d to the word \u201cemployee.\u201d Today, the\ncompany emphasizes, the law often distinguishes between employees\nand independent contractors. Employees are generally understood as\nthose who work \u201cin the service of another person (the employer)\nunder an express or implied contract of hire, under which the\nemployer has the right to control the details of work perform-\nance.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, at 639. Meanwhile, independent\ncontractors are sometimes described as those \u201centrusted to\nundertake a specific project but who [are] left free to do the\nassigned work and to choose the method for accomplishing it.\u201dId., at 888. New Prime argues that, by 1925, the words\n\u201cemployee\u201d and \u201cindependent contractor\u201d had already assumed these\ndistinct meanings.[6] And given\nthat, the company contends, the phrase \u201ccontracts ofemployment\u201d should be understood to refer only to\nrelationships betweenemployers and employees.Unsurprisingly, Mr. Oliveira disagrees. He\nreplies that, while the term \u201cemployment\u201d dates back many\ncenturies, the word \u201cemployee\u201d only made its first appearance in\nEnglish in the 1800s. See Oxford English Dictionary (3d ed., Mar.\n2014), www.oed.com/view/Entry/61374 (all Internet materials as last\nvisited Jan. 9, 2019). At that time, the word from which it\nderived, \u201cemploy,\u201d simply meant to \u201capply (a thing) to some\ndefinite purpose.\u201d 3 J. Murray, A New English Dictionary on\nHistorical Principles 129 (1891). And even in 1910, Black\u2019s Law\nDictionary reported that the term \u201cemployee\u201d had only \u201cbecome\nsomewhat naturalized in our language.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 421\n(2d ed. 1910).Still, the parties do share some common ground.\nThey agree that the word \u201cemployee\u201d eventually came into wide\ncirculation and came to denote those who work for a wage at the\ndirection of another. They agree, too, that all this came to pass\nin part because the word \u201cemployee\u201d didn\u2019t suffer from the same\n\u201chistorical baggage\u201d of the older common law term \u201cservant,\u201d and\nbecause it proved useful when drafting legislation to regulate\nburgeoning industries and their labor forces in the early 20th\ncentury.[7] The parties even\nagree that the development of the term \u201cemployee\u201d may have come to\ninfluence and narrow our understanding of the word \u201cemployment\u201d in\ncomparatively recent years and may be why today it might signify to\nsome a \u201crelationship between master and servant.\u201d[8]But if the parties\u2019 extended etymological debate\npersuades us of anything, it is that care is called for. The words\n\u201cemployee\u201d and \u201cemployment\u201d may share a common root and an\nintertwined history. But they also developed at different times and\nin at least some different ways. The only question in this case\nconcerns the meaning of the term \u201ccontracts ofemployment\u201d\nin 1925. And, whatever the word \u201cemployee\u201d may have meant at that\ntime, and however it may have later influenced the meaning of\n\u201cemployment,\u201d the evidence before us remains that, as dominantly\nunderstood in 1925, a contract ofemploymentdid not\nnecessarily imply the existence of an employer-employee or\nmaster-servant relationship.When New Prime finally turns its attention to\nthe term in dispute, it directs us toCoppagev.Kansas,236 U.S.\n1, 13 (1915). There and in other cases like it, New Prime\nnotes, courts sometimes used the phrase \u201ccontracts of employment\u201d\nto describe what today we\u2019d recognize as agreements between\nemployers and employees. But this proves little. No one doubts that\nemployer-employee agreements to perform work qualified as\n\u201ccontracts of employment\u201d in 1925\u2014and documenting that fact does\nnothing to negate the possibility that \u201ccontracts of employment\u201dalsoembraced agreements by independent contractors to\nperform work. Coming a bit closer to the mark, New Prime eventually\ncites a handful of early 20th-century legal materials that seem to\nuse the term \u201ccontracts of employment\u201d to referexclusivelyto employer-employee agreements.[9] But from the record amassed before us, these\nauthorities appear to represent at most the vanguard, not the main\nbody, of contemporaneous usage.New Prime\u2019s effort to explain away the statute\u2019s\nsuggestive use of the term \u201cworker\u201d proves no more compelling. The\ncompany reminds us that the statute excludes \u201ccontracts of\nemployment\u201d for \u201cseamen\u201d and \u201crailroad employees\u201d as well as other\ntransportation workers. And because \u201cseamen\u201d and \u201crailroad\nemployees\u201d includedonlyemployees in 1925, the company\nreasons, we should understand \u201cany other class of workers engaged\nin .\u00a0.\u00a0. interstate commerce\u201d to bear a similar\nconstruction. But this argument rests on a precarious premise. At\nthe time of the Act\u2019s passage, shipboard surgeons who tended\ninjured sailors were considered \u201cseamen\u201d though they likely served\nin an independent contractor capacity.[10] Even the term \u201crailroad employees\u201d may have swept\nmore broadly at the time of the Act\u2019s passage than might seem\nobvious today. In 1922, for example, the Railroad Labor Board\ninterpreted the word \u201cemployee\u201d in the Transportation Act of 1920\nto refer to anyone \u201cengaged in the customary work directly\ncontributory to the operation of the railroads.\u201d[11] And the Erdman Act, a statute enacted\nto address disruptive railroad strikes at the end of the 19th\ncentury, seems to evince an equally broad understanding of\n\u201crailroad employees.\u201d[12]Unable to squeeze more from the statute\u2019s text,\nNew Prime is left to appeal to its policy. This Court has said that\nCongress adopted the Arbitration Act in an effort to counteract\njudicial hostility to arbitration and establish \u201ca liberal federal\npolicy favoring arbitration agreements.\u201dMoses H. Cone Memorial\nHospitalv.Mercury Constr. Corp.,460 U.S.\n1, 24 (1983). To abide that policy, New Prime suggests, we must\norder arbitration according to the terms of the parties\u2019 agreement.\nBut often and by design it is \u201chard-fought compromise[\u00a0],\u201d not\ncold logic, that supplies the solvent needed for a bill to survive\nthe legislative process.Board of Governors,FRSv.Dimension Financial Corp.,474 U.S.\n361, 374 (1986). If courts felt free to pave over bumpy\nstatutory texts in the name of more expeditiously advancing a\npolicy goal, we would risk failing to \u201ctak[e] .\u00a0.\u00a0.\naccount of\u201d legislative compromises essential to a law\u2019s passage\nand, in that way, thwart rather than honor \u201cthe effectuation of\ncongressional intent.\u201dIbid.By respecting the\nqualifications of \u00a71 today, we \u201crespect the limits up to which\nCongress was prepared\u201d to go when adopting the Arbitration Act.United Statesv.Sisson,399\nU.S. 267, 298 (1970).Finally, and stretching in a different direction\nentirely, New Prime invites us to look beyond the Act. Even if the\nstatute doesn\u2019t supply judges with the power to compel arbitration\nin this case, the company says we should order it anyway because\ncourts always enjoy the inherent authority to stay litigation in\nfavor of an alternative dispute resolution mechanism of the\nparties\u2019 choosing. That, though, is an argument we decline to\ntangle with. The courts below did not address it and we granted\ncertiorari only to resolve existing confusion about the application\nof the Arbitration Act, not to explore other potential avenues for\nreaching a destination it does not.*When Congress enacted the Arbitration Act in\n1925, the term \u201ccontracts of employment\u201d referred to agreements to\nperform work. No less than those who came before him, Mr. Oliveira\nis entitled to the benefit of that same understanding today.\nAccordingly, his agreement with New Prime falls within \u00a71\u2019s\nexception, the court of appeals was correct that it lacked\nauthority under the Act to order arbitration, and the judgment\nisAffirmed.Justice Kavanaugh took no part in the\nconsideration or decision of this case.Notes1See,e.g., 3 J.\nMurray, A New English Dictionary on Historical Principles 130\n(1891) (defining \u201cemployment\u201d as, among other things, \u201c[t]he action\nor process of employing; the state of being employed.
