YELLEN, SECRETARY OF THE\nTREASURY, PETITIONER20\u2013543v.CONFEDERATED TRIBES OF THE CHEHALIS\nRESERVATION, et\u00a0al.ALASKA NATIVE VILLAGE CORPORATION\nASSOCIATION, INC., et\u00a0al., PETITIONERS20\u2013544v.CONFEDERATED TRIBES OF THE CHEHALIS\nRESERVATION, et\u00a0al.on writs of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the district of columbia circuit[June 25, 2021]Justice Sotomayor delivered the opinion of the\nCourt.[1]*In March 2020, Congress passed the Coronavirus\nAid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, 134Stat. 281. Title\nV of the Act allocates $8 billion of monetary relief to \u201cTribal\ngovernments.\u201d 134Stat. 502, 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7801(a)(2)(B).\nUnder the CARES Act, a \u201cTribal government\u201d is the \u201crecognized\ngoverning body of an Indian tribe\u201d as defined in the Indian\nSelf-Determination and Education Assistance Act (ISDA).\n\u00a7\u00a7801(g)(5), (1). ISDA, in turn, defines an \u201cIndian tribe\u201d as \u201cany\nIndian tribe, band, nation, or other organized group or community,\nincluding any Alaska Native village or regional or village\ncorporation as defined in or established pursuant to the Alaska\nNative Claims Settlement Act[,] which is recognized as eligible for\nthe special programs and services provided by the United States to\nIndians because of their status as Indians.\u201d 25 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a75304(e).The Department of the Treasury asked the\nDepartment of the Interior, the agency that administers ISDA,\nwhether Alaska Native Corporations (ANCs) meet that definition.\nConsistent with its longstanding view, the Interior Department said\nyes. The Treasury Department then set aside approximately $500\nmillion of CARES Act funding for the ANCs. The question presented\nis whether ANCs are \u201cIndian tribe[s]\u201d under ISDA, and are therefore\neligible to receive the CARES Act relief set aside by the Treasury\nDepartment. The Court holds that they are.IThis is not the first time the Court has\naddressed the unique circumstances of Alaska and its indigenous\npopulation. See,e.g.,Sturgeonv.Frost, 587\nU.\u00a0S. ___ (2019);Sturgeonv.Frost, 577 U.S.\n424 (2016);Alaskav.Native Village of Venetie Tribal\nGovernment,522 U.S.\n520(1998);Metlakatla Indian Communityv.Egan,369 U.S.\n45(1962). The \u201csimple truth\u201d reflected in those prior cases is\nthat \u201cAlaska is often the exception, not the rule.\u201dSturgeon, 577 U.\u00a0S., at 440. To see why, one must first\nunderstand the United States\u2019 unique historical relationship with\nAlaska Natives.AWhen the United States purchased the Territory\nof Alaska from Russia in 1867, Alaska Natives lived in communities\ndispersed widely across Alaska\u2019s 365 million acres. In the decades\nthat followed, \u201c[t]here was never an attempt in Alaska to isolate\nIndians on reservations,\u201d as there had been in the lower 48 States.Metlakatla Indian Community, 369 U.\u00a0S., at 51. As a\nconsequence, the claims of Alaska Natives to Alaskan land remained\nlargely unsettled even following Alaska\u2019s admission to the Union as\nour 49th State in 1959.[2] See\nAlaska Statehood Act, \u00a74, 72Stat. 339;Sturgeon, 577\nU.\u00a0S., at 429.That changed in 1971 with the Alaska Native\nClaims Settlement Act (ANCSA). 85Stat. 688, 43 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a71601et\u00a0seq.ANCSA officially dispensed with the idea\nof recreating in Alaska the system of reservations that prevailed\nin the lower 48 States. It extinguished Alaska Natives\u2019 claims to\nland and hunting rights and revoked all but one of Alaska\u2019s\nexisting reservations. \u00a71610. In exchange, \u201cCongress authorized the\ntransfer of $962.5 million in state and federal funds and\napproximately 44 million acres of Alaska land to state-chartered\nprivate business corporations that were to be formed pursuant to\u201d\nANCSA.Native Village of Venetie Tribal Government, 522\nU.\u00a0S., at 524. These corporations are called ANCs.Relevant here, ANCs come in two varieties:\nregional ANCs and village ANCs. To form the regional ANCs, the Act\ndirected the Secretary of the Interior to divide Alaska into 12\ngeographic regions. \u00a71606(a). Within each region, Alaska Natives\nwere instructed to \u201cincorporate under the laws of Alaska a Regional\nCorporation to conduct business for profit.\u201d \u00a71606(d). To form the\nvillage ANCs, the Act identified approximately 200 Alaska \u201cNative\nvillages,\u201d a term encompassing any community of 25 or more Alaska\nNatives living together as of the 1970 census. \u00a7\u00a71602(c), 1610(b),\n1615(a). For each Alaska Native village, ANCSA ordered the \u201cNative\nresidents\u201d to create an accompanying village corporation to \u201chold,\ninvest, manage and/or distribute lands, property, funds, and other\nrights and assets for and on behalf\u00a0\u201d of the village.\n\u00a7\u00a71602(j), 1607(a). ANCSA then directed the Secretary to prepare a\nroll showing the region and, if applicable, village to which each\nliving Alaska Native belonged. \u00a71604. Enrolled Alaska Natives then\nreceived shares in their respective ANCs. \u00a7\u00a71606(g), 1607.BIn 1975, four years after ANCSA\u2019s enactment,\nCongress passed ISDA. 25 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a75301et\u00a0seq.ISDA answered the call for a \u201cnew national\npolicy\u201d of \u201cautonomy\u201d and \u201ccontrol\u201d for Native Americans and Alaska\nNatives. H. R. Doc. No. 91\u2013363, p.\u00a03 (1970); see alsoMenominee Tribe of Wis.v.United States, 577 U.S.\n250, 252 (2016) (\u201cCongress enacted [ISDA] in 1975 to help Indian\ntribes assume responsibility for aid programs that benefit their\nmembers\u201d).ISDA decentralized the provision of federal\nIndian benefits away from the Federal Government and toward Native\nAmerican and Alaska Native organizations. ISDA allows any \u201cIndian\ntribe\u201d to request that the Secretary of the Interior enter into a\nself-determination contract with a designated \u201ctribal\norganization.\u201d \u00a75321(a)(1). Under such a contract, the tribal\norganization delivers federally funded economic, infrastructure,\nhealth, or education benefits to the tribe\u2019s membership.As originally drafted, ISDA\u2019s \u201cIndian tribe\u201d\ndefinition did not mention ANCs. H. R. 6372, 93d Cong., 1st Sess.,\n\u00a71(a) (1973) (defining \u201cIndian tribe\u201d to mean \u201can Indian tribe,\nband, nation, or Alaska Native Community for which the Federal\nGovernment provides special programs and services because of its\nIndian identity\u201d). Prior to passage, however, the definition was\namended twice to include, first, Alaska Native villages and,\nsecond, ANCs. See H. R. Rep. No. 93\u20131600, p.\u00a014 (1974) (\u201cThe\nSubcommittee amended the definition of \u2018Indian tribe\u2019 to include\nregional and village corporations established by [ANCSA]\u201d). Today,\nISDA defines an \u201cIndian tribe\u201d as \u201cany Indian tribe, band, nation,\nor other organized group or community, including any Alaska Native\nvillage or regional or village corporation as defined in or\nestablished pursuant to [ANCSA], which is recognized as eligible\nfor the special programs and services provided by the United States\nto Indians because of their status as Indians.\u201d \u00a75304(e).[3]Despite the express inclusion of ANCs in the\ndefinition of \u201cIndian tribe,\u201d a question arose in the Interior\nDepartment whether the \u201crecognized-as-eligible clause\u201d limits the\ndefinition to \u201cfederally recognized tribes\u201d only. A federally\nrecognized tribe is one that has entered into \u201ca\ngovernment-to-government relationship [with] the United States.\u201d 1\nF. Cohen, Handbook of Federal Indian Law \u00a73.02[3] (N. Newton ed.\n2012). This recognition can come in a number of ways: \u201cfrom treaty,\nstatute, executive or administrative order, or from a course of\ndealing with the tribe as a political entity.\u201d W. Canby, American\nIndian Law in a Nutshell 4 (7th ed. 2020). As private companies\nincorporated under state law, ANCs have never been \u201crecognized\u201d by\nthe United States in this sovereign political sense.In 1976, the year after ISDA\u2019s enactment, the\nInterior Department\u2019s Assistant Solicitor for Indian Affairs issued\na memorandum on the status of ANCs under ISDA. App. 44\u201348. In the\nAssistant Solicitor\u2019s view, the express inclusion of ANCs within\nthe definition of \u201cIndian tribe\u201d confirmed that ANCs are Indian\ntribes under ISDA, even though they are not federally recognized\ntribes. In the decades since, the Interior Department has\nrepeatedly reaffirmed that position. See,e.g., 60 Fed. Reg.\n9250 (1995) (ANCs \u201cha[ve] been designated as \u2018tribes\u2019 for the\npurposes of some Federal laws,\u201d including ISDA); 58 Fed. Reg. 54364\n(1993) (ANCs \u201care not governments, but they have been designated as\n\u2018tribes\u2019 for the purposes of\u00a0\u201d ISDA); 53 Fed. Reg. 52833\n(1988) (ISDA \u201cspecifically include[s]\u201d ANCs).CIn 2020, Congress incorporated ISDA\u2019s \u201cIndian\ntribe\u201d definition into the CARES Act. 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7801(g)(1). Title V of the Act allocates $150 billion to \u201cStates,\nTribal governments, and units of local government\u201d to compensate\nfor unbudgeted expenditures made in response to COVID\u201319.\n\u00a7801(a)(1). Of that $150 billion, $8 billion is reserved for\n\u201cTribal governments.\u201d \u00a7801(a)(2)(B). A \u201cTribal government\u201d is the\n\u201crecognized governing body of an Indian Tribe,\u201d as ISDA defines the\nlatter term. \u00a7\u00a7801(g)(5), (1).On April 23, 2020, the Treasury Department\ndetermined that ANCs are eligible for CARES Act relief, and set\naside more than $500 million for them (since reduced to\napproximately $450 million). App. 53\u201354; Letter from E. Prelogar,\nActing Solicitor General, to S. Harris, Clerk of Court (May 12,\n2021). Soon after the Treasury Department\u2019s announcement, a number\nof federally recognized tribes (respondents) sued, arguing that\nonly federally recognized tribes are Indian tribes under ISDA, and\nthus under the CARES Act. Some Tribes further argued that ANCs do\nnot have a \u201crecognized governing body\u201d for purposes of the CARES\nAct and are ineligible to receive its funding for that reason as\nwell.The suits were consolidated in the District\nCourt for the District of Columbia, which ultimately entered\nsummary judgment for the Treasury Department and the ANCs. The\nCourt of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed.Confederated Tribes of Chehalis Reservationv.Mnuchin, 976 F.3d 15 (2020). In its view, the\nrecognized-as-eligible clause is a term of art requiring any Indian\ntribe to be a federally recognized tribe. Because no ANC is\nfederally recognized, the court reasoned, no ANC qualifies for\nfunding under Title V of the CARES Act. In so holding, the\nD.\u00a0C. Circuit split with the Ninth Circuit, which had held\ndecades prior inCook Inlet Native Assn.v.Bowen,\n810 F.2d 1471 (1987), that ANCs are Indian tribes for ISDA\npurposes, regardless of whether they have been federally\nrecognized.Id., at 1474.We granted certiorari, 592 U.\u00a0S. ___\n(2021), to resolve the Circuit split and determine whether ANCs are\neligible for the CARES Act funding set aside by the Treasury\nDepartment.IIAll but one of the respondent Tribes agree\nthat ANCs are eligible to receive the CARES Act funds in question\nif they are Indian tribes for purposes of ISDA.[4] The primary question for the Court, then, is\nwhether ANCs satisfy ISDA\u2019s definition of \u201cIndian tribe.\u201d The ANCs\nask the Court to answer that question by looking to the\ndefinition\u2019s plain meaning. Respondents ask the Court to adopt a\nterm-of-art construction that equates being \u201crecognized as eligible\nfor the special programs and services provided by the United States\nto Indians\u201d with being a \u201cfederally recognized tribe,\u201di.e.,\na tribe recognized by the United States in a sovereign political\nsense.AStarting with the plain meaning, an \u201cIndian\ntribe\u201d under ISDA is a \u201ctribe, band, nation, or other organized\ngroup or community, including any Alaska Native village or regional\nor village corporation as defined in or established pursuant to\n[ANCSA], which is recognized as eligible for the special programs\nand services provided by the United States to Indians because of\ntheir status as Indians.\u201d 25 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a75304(e). The\ndefinition\u2019s first two clauses are straightforward enough. The\nfirst lists entities that might count as Indian tribes under the\nAct (e.g., tribes, bands, nations). The second, \u201cthe Alaska\nclause,\u201d makes clear that Alaska Native villages and ANCs are\n\u201cinclud[ed].\u201d The third, \u201cthe recognized-as-eligible clause,\u201d\nrequires more analysis. According to that clause, the listed\nentities must be \u201crecognized as eligible for the special programs\nand services provided by the United States to Indians because of\ntheir status as Indians.\u201dANCs, of course, are \u201cestablished pursuant to\u201d\nANCSA within the meaning of the Alaska clause. They are thereby\n\u201crecognized as eligible\u201d for ANCSA\u2019s benefits. The trickier\nquestion is whether eligibility for the benefits of ANCSA counts as\neligibility for \u201cthe special programs and services provided by the\nUnited States to Indians because of their status as Indians.\u201dIt does. Contrary to the dissent\u2019s view,post, at 9\u201310 (opinion of Gorsuch, J.), ANCSA is readily\ndescribed as a special program provided by the United States to\n\u201cIndians\u201d (in this case, Alaska Natives). See 43 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a71626 (describing ANCSA\u2019s relationship to \u201cother programs\u201d). The\nscope of that program is substantial: ANCSA made ANCs eligible to\nselect tens of millions of acres of land and receive hundreds of\nmillions of tax-exempt dollars. \u00a7\u00a71605, 1610, 1611. Not just a\none-time payment, ANCSA provides for revenue sharing among the\nregional ANCs to ensure Alaska Natives across the State benefit\nfrom an ongoing equitable distribution of ANC profits. \u00a71606(i).\nANCSA further entrusts ANCs to \u201chold, invest, manage and/or\ndistribute lands, property, funds, and other rights and assets for\nand on behalf\u00a0\u201d of Alaska Natives, who are the ANCs\u2019\nshareholders, as well as to distribute dividends to them. See\n\u00a7\u00a71602(j), 1606(j). Moreover, ANCs and their shareholders are\n\u201celigible for the benefits of\u00a0\u201d ANCSA, \u00a71606(d), precisely\nbecause of their status as Indians. See \u00a71626(e)(1) (\u201cFor all\npurposes of Federal law, a Native Corporation shall be considered\nto be a corporation owned and controlled by Natives\u201d); note\nfollowing \u00a71601, p.\u00a01136 (ANCSA is \u201c\u00a0\u2018Indian legislation\nenacted by Congress pursuant to its plenary authority under the\nConstitution of the United States to regulate Indian\naffairs\u2019\u00a0\u201d).Respondents do not deny that the benefits of\nANCSA are \u201ca\u201d special program or service provided by the United\nStates to Indians. According to respondents, however, such benefits\nare not \u201cthe\u201d special programs and services provided to Indians\n(e.g., healthcare, education, and other social services\nprovided by federal agencies like the Bureau of Indian Affairs and\nthe Indian Health Service). \u201cThe\u201d special programs and services,\nrespondents assert, are available only to federally recognized\ntribes (or, more precisely, to members of such tribes). In\nrespondents\u2019 view, ANCs are thus \u201cinclud[ed]\u201d in the \u201cIndian tribe\u201d\ndefinition\u2019s Alaska clause only to be excluded en masse from that\ndefinition by the recognized-as-eligible clause.That would certainly be an odd result.\nFortunately, the text does not produce it. ISDA\u2019s \u201cIndian tribe\u201d\ndefinition does not specify the particular programs and services an\nentity must be eligible for to satisfy the recognized-as-eligible\nclause. Given that ANCSA is the only statute the \u201cIndian tribe\u201d\ndefinition mentions by name, the best reading of the definition is\nthat being eligible for ANCSA\u2019s benefits by itself satisfies the\nrecognized-as-eligible clause.Consider a similarly worded example. A doctor\nrecommends getting a blood test every six months to \u201cany child,\nadult, or senior, including anyone over the age of 75 whose\nblood-sugar levels have tested in the prediabetic range within the\nlast five years, who exhibits the warning signs of Type 2\ndiabetes.\u201d Without further context, it is unclear exactly which\nwarning signs the doctor is referring to, or how many of those\nsigns a child, adult, or senior must exhibit before warranting\nbiannual testing. But it is fair to say that individuals over 75\nwith prediabetic blood-sugar levels within the last five years\nshould get tested biannually, even if they exhibit no other warning\nsigns. By expressly \u201cincluding\u201d individuals with that one warning\nsign, the doctor\u2019s recommendation makes clear that particular sign,\nby itself, is warning enough.Just so here: Congress\u2019 express inclusion of\nANCs \u201cestablished pursuant to [ANCSA]\u201d confirms that eligibility\nfor ANCSA\u2019s benefits alone is eligibility enough to be an Indian\ntribe. ANCs thus satisfy ISDA\u2019s Indian tribe definition, regardless\nof whether they and their shareholders are eligible for federal\nIndian programs and services other than those provided in ANCSA. At\nany rate, the one-to-one relationship respondents posit between\nmembership in a federally recognized tribe and eligibility for\nfederal Indian benefits more broadly does not hold in the unique\ncircumstances of Alaska. See Letter from E. Prelogar, Acting\nSolicitor General, to S. Harris, Clerk of Court (Apr. 22, 2021)\n(\u201c[T]he federal government has historically provided benefits and\nservices to Alaska Natives who are not enrolled members of a\nfederally recognized Indian tribe\u201d); D. Case & D. Voluck,\nAlaska Natives and Americans Laws 30 (3d ed. 2012) (\u201c[T]he federal\ngovernment has, at least since the end of the nineteenth century,\nprovided a wide variety of programs and services to Alaska Natives\nsolely because of their status as Natives\u201d). So ANCSA is not, in\nfact, the only federal Indian program or service for which ANCs and\ntheir shareholders are eligible.It should come as no surprise that Congress made\nANCs eligible to contract under ISDA. After all, Congress itself\ncreated ANCs just four years earlier to receive the benefits of the\nAlaska land settlement on behalf of all Alaska Natives. Allowing\nANCs to distribute federal Indian benefits more broadly is entirely\nconsistent with the approach Congress charted in ANCSA. Accord, 1\nAmerican Indian Policy Review Comm\u2019n, Final Report, 95th Cong., 1st\nSess., 495 (Comm. Print 1977) (ANCs \u201cmight well be the form or\norganization best suited to sponsor certain kinds of federally\nfunded programs\u201d in Alaska); 43 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71606(r) (\u201cThe\nauthority of a Native Corporation to provide benefits\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. to promote the health, education, or welfare of\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. shareholders or family members is expressly\nauthorized and confirmed\u201d).Under the plain meaning of ISDA, ANCs are Indian\ntribes, regardless of whether they are also federally recognized\ntribes. In so holding, the Court does not open the door to other\nIndian groups that have not been federally recognized becoming\nIndian tribes under ISDA. Even if such groups qualify for certain\nfederal benefits, that does not make them similarly situated to\nANCs. ANCs aresui generisentities created by federal\nstatute and granted an enormous amount of special federal benefits\nas part of a legislative experiment tailored to the unique\ncircumstances of Alaska and recreated nowhere else. Moreover, with\nthe exception of Alaska Native villages (which are now federally\nrecognized), no entities other than ANCs are expressly \u201cinclud[ed]\u201d\nby name in ISDA\u2019s \u201cIndian tribe\u201d definition. Cf.Sturgeon,\n577 U.\u00a0S., at 440 (\u201cAll those Alaska-specific provisions\nreflect the simple truth that Alaska is often the exception, not\nthe rule\u201d).BRespondents urge this Court to discard the\nplain meaning of the \u201cIndian tribe\u201d definition in favor of a\nterm-of-art construction. In respondents\u2019 view, the 69 words of the\n\u201cIndian tribe\u201d definition are a long way of saying just 8: An\n\u201cIndian tribe\u201d means a \u201cfederally recognized tribe.\u201d If that is\nright, respondents are correct that ANCs are not Indian tribes,\nbecause everyone agrees they are not federally recognized tribes.\nTo prevail on this argument, however, respondents must demonstrate\nthat the statutory context supports reading ISDA\u2019s \u201cIndian tribe\u201d\ndefinition as a term of art rather than according to its plain\nmeaning. SeeJohnsonv.United States,559 U.S.\n133, 139 (2010). Their efforts are not persuasive.In arguing for a term-of-art construction,\nrespondents first rely on a series of Acts that terminated various\ntribes starting in the late 1950s. Those Acts closed tribal\nmembership rolls, specified the division of tribal assets, and\nrevoked tribal constitutions. See,e.g., Act of Sept. 21,\n1959, Pub. L. No. 86\u2013322, 73Stat. 592. Following termination, the\ntribe and its members were no longer \u201centitled to any of the\nspecial services performed by the United States for Indians because\nof their status as Indians.\u201d \u00a75,id.,at 593. As respondents\nnote, this language resembles (although does not mirror precisely)\nthe final words of ISDA\u2019s recognized-as-eligible clause. If being\nterminated means no longer being \u201centitled to any of the special\nservices performed by the United States for Indians because of\ntheir status as Indians,\u201d the argument goes, then being \u201crecognized\nas eligible for the special programs and services provided by the\nUnited States to Indians because of their status as Indians\u201d means\nbeing a federally recognized tribe.Respondents misjudge the relevance of these\ntermination statutes. Those statutes do not contain the words\n\u201crecognized as eligible\u201d; they do not even contain the word\n\u201crecognized.\u201d Furthermore, the termination statutes use their\nISDA-reminiscent phrasing not as a synonym for termination but to\ndescribe just one, among other, consequences of a tribe\u2019s\nconstitution being revoked. See,e.g.,ibid.(\u201cThe\nconstitution of the tribe .\u00a0.\u00a0. shall be revoked by the\nSecretary. Thereafter, the tribe and its members shall not be\nentitled to any of the special services performed by the United\nStates for Indians because of their status as Indians, all statutes\nof the United States that affect Indians because of their status as\nIndians shall be inapplicable to them, and the laws of the several\nStates shall apply to them in the same manner they apply to other\npersons or citizens within their jurisdiction\u201d).Some linguistic similarity between ISDA and the\ntermination statutes does not suggest that the language of the\nrecognized-as-eligible clause was an accepted way of saying \u201ca\nfederally recognized tribe\u201d in 1975. It instead supports a much\nmore limited proposition: A federally recognized tribe that has not\nbeen terminated is \u201centitled\u201d to \u201cspecial services performed by the\nUnited States for Indians,\u201d and thereby satisfies ISDA\u2019s similarly\nworded recognized-as-eligible clause. But of course, no one\ndisputes that being a federally recognized tribe is one way to\nqualify as an Indian tribe under ISDA; it is just not the only\nway.Nor is the mere inclusion of the word\n\u201crecognized\u201d enough to give the recognized-as-eligible clause a\nterm-of-art meaning. True, the word \u201crecognized\u201d often refers to a\ntribe with which the United States has a government-to-government\nrelationship (particularly when it is sandwiched between the words\n\u201cfederally\u201d and \u201ctribe\u201d). That does not mean, however, that the\nword \u201crecognized\u201d always connotes political recognition.[5]\u201cRecognized\u201d is too common and context dependent\na word to bear so loaded a meaning wherever it appears, even in\nlaws concerning Native Americans and Alaska Natives. Cf.Bruesewitzv.Wyeth LLC,562\nU.S. 223, 235 (2011) (declining to read \u201cunavoidable\u201d as a term\nof art in part because \u201c\u00a0\u2018[u]navoidable\u2019 is hardly a rarely\nused word\u201d). Certainly, \u201crecognized\u201d can signify political\nrecognition; it can also refer to something far more pedestrian.\nSee,e.g., Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1436 (rev. 4th ed. 1968)\n(defining \u201crecognition\u201d as \u201c[r]atification; confirmation; an\nacknowledgment that something done by another person in one\u2019s name\nhad one\u2019s authority\u201d). The type of recognition required is a\nquestion best answered in context. See,e.g., 25\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73002(a)(2)(C)(1) (providing for control over\ncertain cultural items \u201cin the Indian tribe that is recognized as\naboriginally occupying the area in which the objects were\ndiscovered\u201d); \u00a74352(3) (defining a \u201cNative Hawaiian organization\u201d\nas a nonprofit that, among other things, \u201cis recognized for having\nexpertise in Native Hawaiian culture and heritage, including\ntourism\u201d). In ISDA, the required recognition is of an entity\u2019s\neligibility for federal Indian programs and services, not a\ngovernment-to-government relationship with the United\nStates.[6]Respondents next rely on sources that postdate\nISDA. Ordinarily, however, this Court reads statutory language as a\nterm of art only when the language was used in that way at the time\nof the statute\u2019s adoption. SeeFood Marketing Institutev.Argus Leader Media, 588 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2019) (slip\nop., at 10) (rejecting a term-of-art reading where the parties\n\u201cmustered no evidence that the terms of\u00a0\u201d the statute carried\na \u201cspecialized common law meaning .\u00a0.\u00a0. at the time of\ntheir adoption\u201d). In relying on sources postdating ISDA,\nrespondents must show not only that the language of the\nrecognized-as-eligible clause later became a term of art, but also\nthat this term-of-art understanding should be backdated to ISDA\u2019s\npassage in 1975. They cannot make that showing.Respondents lean most heavily on the Federally\nRecognized Indian Tribe List Act of 1994 (List Act), enacted almost\n20 years after ISDA. See 25 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a75130, 5131. The\nList Act requires the Secretary of the Interior to publish an\nannual list of \u201call Indian tribes which the Secretary recognizes to\nbe eligible for the special programs and services provided by the\nUnited States to Indians because of their status as Indians.\u201d\n\u00a75131(a). According to respondents, ANCs\u2019 absence from the\nSecretary\u2019s list confirms that they are not \u201celigible for the\nspecial programs and services provided by the United States to\nIndians because of their status as Indians,\u201d \u00a75304(e), and thus\nfail ISDA\u2019s recognized-as-eligible clause.Respondents\u2019 cross-referencing argument,\nhowever, requires the Court to ignore the reason why ANCs are not\non the list. True to its full name, the Federally Recognized Indian\nTribe List Act tasks the Secretary with maintaining a \u201c\u00a0\u2018list\nof federally recognized tribes\u2019\u00a0\u201d only. Note following \u00a75130,\np.\u00a0678. The List Act, moreover, lacks language like that in\nISDA expressly \u201cincluding\u201d ANCs \u201cestablished pursuant to\u201d ANCSA.\n\u00a75304(e). The obvious inference, then, is that ANCs are not on the\nSecretary\u2019s list simply because they are not federally\nrecognized.History confirms as much. In 1979, 15 years\nbefore the List Act was passed, the Secretary began publishing a\nlist of Indian tribes \u201cthat have a government-to-government\nrelationship with the United States.\u201d 44 Fed. Reg. 7235. In 1988,\nANCs were added to the Secretary\u2019s list, which had been retitled\n\u201cIndian Entities Recognized and Eligible To Receive Services From\nthe United States Bureau of Indian Affairs,\u201d because ANCs are\n\u201cspecifically eligible for the funding and services of the [Bureau\nof Indian Affairs] by statute\u201d and \u201cshould not have to undertake to\nobtain Federal Acknowledgement\u201d (i.e., federal recognition).\n53 Fed. Reg. 52829, 52832. In 1993, the Secretary dropped ANCs from\nthe list, concluding that \u201cthe inclusion of ANC[s], which lack\ntribal status in a political sense, called into question the\nstatus\u201d of the other entities on the list. 58 Fed. Reg. 54365. In\nso doing, the Secretary reaffirmed that ANCs \u201care not governments,\nbut they have been designated as \u2018tribes\u2019 for the purposes of some\nFederal laws,\u201d including ISDA.Id., at 54364. The List Act,\npassed the following year, \u201cconfirmed the Secretary\u2019s authority and\nresponsibility\u201d to maintain a list of federally recognized tribes.\n60 Fed. Reg. 9251. Hence, ANCs remained off the list.To accept respondents\u2019 argument, then, the Court\nwould need to cross-reference ISDA\u2019s definition of an \u201cIndian\ntribe\u201d with the Secretary\u2019s list, but ignore why ANCs were excluded\nfrom that list in the first place. The Court declines to take that\ndoubtful step.Despite asking the Court to consider post-ISDA\nstatutes to determine whether ANCs are \u201cIndian tribes\u201d under ISDA,\nmoreover, respondents largely fail to address post-ISDA\ncongressional actions that contradict their position. First,\nconsider Congress\u2019 treatment of the Cook Inlet Region, Inc. (CIRI),\nthe regional ANC for the ANCSA region covering more than half the\nAlaskan population. See The Twelve Regions, ANCSA Regional\nAssociation (June 1, 2021),\nhttps://ancsaregional.com/the-twelve-regions. In 1994, CIRI\ncontracted under ISDA through its designated healthcare provider to\noffer healthcare benefits to Alaska Natives and American Indians in\nAnchorage and the Matanuska-Susitna Valley. SeeCook Inlet\nTreaty Tribesv.Shalala,166 F.3d 986, 988 (CA9 1999). A group of Alaska Native villages\nsued, arguing that the Federal Government should have first\nobtained their approval.Ibid.; see 25 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a75304(l) (\u201c[I]n any case where [an ISDA contract] benefit[s]\nmore than one Indian tribe, the approval of each such Indian tribe\u201d\nis required). Congress mooted the dispute by passing a bill that\nwaived ISDA\u2019s normal tribal approval requirement for CIRI\u2019s\nhealthcare contracts. Department of the Interior and Related\nAgencies Appropriations Act, 1998, \u00a7325(a), 111Stat. 1597\u20131598. In\nso doing, Congress not only assumed CIRI was eligible to enter into\nISDA contracts (notwithstanding its lack of federal recognition),\nbut actively cleared the way for it to do so.Next, consider the Native American Housing\nAssistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996 (NAHASDA), 25\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a74101et seq., which incorporates ISDA\u2019s\n\u201cIndian tribe\u201d definition, see \u00a74103(13)(B). NAHASDA creates a\nhousing block grant program for Indian tribes. \u00a74111. The regional\nANCs (acting through their designated housing authorities) are\namong the largest recipients of these grants in Alaska, receiving\ntens of millions of dollars each year. See Dept. of Housing and\nUrban Development, FY 2020 Final [Indian Housing Block Grant]\nFunding by [Tribally Designated Housing Entities] & Regions.\nFor years, Congress has passed appropriations riders requiring that\nthe existing recipients of NAHASDA\u2019s housing block grants in Alaska\n(including ANCs) continue to receive those grants. See,e.g., Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020, Pub. L.\n116\u201394, Div. H, Tit. II, \u00a7211, 133Stat. 3003. Following the\nD.\u00a0C. Circuit\u2019s decision in this case, Congress awarded\nadditional grants under NAHASDA and emphasized that, \u201c[f]or the\navoidance of doubt,\u201d the \u201cIndian tribe[s]\u201d eligible for those\ngrants \u201cshall include Alaska native corporations established\npursuant to\u201d ANCSA. Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, Pub. L.\n116\u2013260, Div. N, Tit. V, Subtit. A, \u00a7501(k)(2)(C), 134Stat.\n2077.Thus, post-ISDA sources prove no more fruitful\nto respondents than pre-ISDA ones. Even assuming the Court should\nlook to events after 1975, respondents cannot cherry-pick statutes\nlike the List Act without explaining postenactment developments\nthat undermine their interpretation. In the end, the various\nstatutes cited do not support respondents\u2019 efforts to exclude ANCs\nfrom ISDA by use of a term-of-art construction.[7]CEven if ANCs did not satisfy the\nrecognized-as-eligible clause, however, they would still satisfy\nISDA\u2019s definition of an \u201cIndian tribe.\u201d If respondents were correct\nthat only a federally recognized tribe can satisfy that clause,\nthen the best way to read the \u201cIndian tribe\u201d definition as a whole\nwould be for the recognized-as-eligible clause not to apply to the\nentities in the Alaska clause at all (i.e., to \u201cany Alaska\nNative village or regional or village corporation,\u201d 25\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a75304(e)). On this reading, the way to tell\nwhether a tribe, band, nation, or other organized group or\ncommunity is an \u201cIndian tribe\u201d is to ask whether it is federally\nrecognized, but the way to tell whether an Alaska Native village or\ncorporation is an \u201cIndian tribe\u201d is to ask whether it is \u201cdefined\nin or established pursuant to\u201d ANCSA.Ibid.Otherwise,\ndespite being prominently \u201cinclud[ed]\u201d in the \u201cIndian tribe\u201d\ndefinition,ibid., all ANCs would be excluded by a\nfederal-recognition requirement there is no reasonable prospect\nthey could ever satisfy.Respondents object (and the dissent agrees) that\nthis construction \u201cproduces grammatical incoherence.\u201d Brief for\nRespondents Confederated Tribes of Chehalis Reservation et\u00a0al.\n16;post, at 4\u20135. They point out that a modifying clause at\nthe end of a list (like the recognized-as-eligible clause) often\napplies to every item in the list. See,e.g.,Jamav.Immigration and Customs Enforcement,543\nU.S. 335, 344, n.\u00a04 (2005). The so-called series-qualifier\ncanon can be a helpful interpretive tool, and it supports the idea\nthat the recognized-as-eligible clause applies to every type of\nentity listed in the \u201cIndian tribe\u201d definition, including ANCs.\nGiven that the entities in the Alaska clause are the closest in\nproximity to the recognized-as-eligible clause, that canon arguably\napplies with particular force here.As the Court reiterated earlier this Term,\nhowever, the series-qualifier canon gives way when it would yield a\n\u201ccontextually implausible outcome.\u201dFacebook,Inc.v.Duguid, 592 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2021) (slip op., at 9); see\nalsoid., at ___ (Alito, J., concurring in judgment) (slip\nop., at 1) (noting that \u201c[c]anons are useful tools, but it is\nimportant to keep their limitations in mind. This may be especially\ntrue with respect to .\u00a0.\u00a0. the \u2018series-qualifier\u2019\ncanon\u201d). The most grammatical reading of a sentence in a vacuum\ndoes not always produce the best reading in context. See,e.g.,Sturgeon, 577 U.\u00a0S., at 438 (\u201cStatutory\nlanguage \u2018cannot be construed in a vacuum. It is a fundamental\ncanon of statutory construction that the words of a statute must be\nread in their context and with a view to their place in the overall\nstatutory scheme\u2019\u00a0\u201d); cf. B. Garner, Modern English Usage 784\n(4th ed. 2016) (noting the \u201cincreasingly common\u201d \u201c\u00a0\u2018remote\nrelative,\u2019\u00a0\u201di.e., the practice of separating \u201cthe\nrelative pronoun (that,which,who) from its\nantecedent\u201d).Consider an example with the same syntax as the\n\u201cIndian tribe\u201d definition. A restaurant advertises \u201c50% off any\nmeat, vegetable, or seafood dish, including ceviche, which is\ncooked.\u201d Say a customer orders ceviche, a Peruvian specialty of raw\nfish marinated in citrus juice. Would she expect it to be cooked?\nNo. Would she expect to pay full price for it? Again, no. Under the\nreading recommended by the series-qualifier canon, however, the\nceviche was a red herring. Even though the 50%-off sale\nspecifically named ceviche (and no other dish), it costs full price\nbecause it is not cooked. That conclusion would make no sense to a\nreasonable customer.Like applying a \u201ccooked\u201d requirement to ceviche,\napplying a \u201cfederally recognized\u201d requirement to ANCs is\nimplausible in context. When Congress enacted ISDA in 1975, not a\nsingle Alaska Native village or ANC had been recognized for a\ngovernment-to-government relationship with the United States. On\nrespondents\u2019 reading, then, the entire Alaska clause originally had\nno effect. None of its entities qualified as Indian tribes for\npurposes of ISDA, even though the only entities expressly included\nin ISDA\u2019s definition of an \u201cIndian tribe\u201d are those in the Alaska\nclause.The only explanation respondents offer for this\nhighly counterintuitive result is that Congress included Alaska\nNative villages and corporations in the \u201cIndian tribe\u201d definition\non the possibility they might one day become federally recognized.\nThat is highly unlikely. First, the Alaska clause would be\nredundant on that account. See Brief for Respondents Confederated\nTribes of Chehalis Reservation et\u00a0al. 31 ([T]he Alaska\n[clause] is .\u00a0.\u00a0. best read as redundant\u201d). A federally\nrecognized Alaska Native village or ANC would presumably already\nfit into one of the pre-existing ISDA categories of \u201ctribe[s],\nband[s], nation[s], or other organized group[s] or communit[ies].\u201d\n25 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a75304(e).Second, it is quite doubtful that anyone in 1975\nthought the United States was going to recognize ANCs as sovereign\npolitical entities. ANCs are for-profit companies incorporated\nunder state law that Congress itself created just four years prior\nto ISDA. They are not at all the type of entities normally\nconsidered for a government-to-government relationship with the\nUnited States. Accord, 25 CFR \u00a783.4 (1994) (\u201cThe Department will\nnot acknowledge,\u201di.e., federally recognize, \u201c[a]n\nassociation, organization, corporation, or entity of any character\nformed in recent times unless the entity has only changed form by\nrecently incorporating or otherwise formalizing its existing\npolitically autonomous community\u201d). Indeed, at the time ISDA was\nenacted, some doubted whether even Alaska Native villages could be\nfederally recognized.[8]Respondents counter by pointing to certain\norganizations created in Alaska in the 1930s that later became\nfederally recognized tribes. One such organization, the Hydaburg\nCooperative Association (HCA), was formed under the 1936 Amendment\nto the Indian Reorganization Act, which authorized Alaska Natives\ngroups \u201cnot heretofore recognized as bands or tribes\u201d to organize\nbased on \u201ca common bond of occupation, or association, or\nresidence.\u201d Ch. 254, 49Stat. 1250 (codified at 25\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a75119). The HCA organized around \u201ca common bond\nof occupation in the fish industry.\u201d Constitution and By-Laws of\nthe Hydaburg Cooperative Association, Alaska Preamble (1938).\nDecades later, the Interior Department acknowledged the HCA as a\nfederally recognized tribe, even though it is of fairly recent\nvintage and organized around a bond of occupation rather than\nsolely around an ancestral tribal heritage. See 58 Fed. Reg. 54369.\nIf the HCA could be federally recognized, respondents say, some\nmight have thought ANCs could too.Respondents make too much of the HCA and the\nsmall handful of entities like it, which are not comparable to\nANCs. Unlike ANCs, the former entities were organized under\nfederally approved constitutions as part of a short-lived attempt\nto recreate in Alaska a tribal reservation system like that in the\nlower 48 States. ANCs, by contrast, were incorporated under state\nlaw pursuant to legislation that embodied the formal repudiation of\nthat approach. That the Interior Department deemed the HCA and a\nhandful of other entities like it federally recognized tribes\ndecades after ISDA\u2019s passage does not mean it was plausible in 1975\nto think ANCs would one day become federally recognized tribes, as\nwell.[9]Ultimately, respondents resort to the argument\nthat, although the idea of ANCs becoming federally recognized\ntribes might be farfetched, it is not technically impossible. That\nis, Congress\u2019 plenary power over Indian affairs could conceivably\npermit it to recognize a government-to- government relationship\nbetween an ANC and the United States. Perhaps, but possibility is\nnot the same as plausibility, and both are proper concerns of\nstatutory interpretation. Consider again the example of a\nrestaurant advertising \u201c50% off any meat, vegetable, or seafood\ndish, including ceviche, which is cooked.\u201d On respondents\u2019 logic,\nbecause the restaurant technically could cook its ceviche, the only\nway to read the advertisement is that ceviche is full price unless\nthe restaurant takes an unexpected culinary step.That is wrong. The best reading of the\nadvertisement is that ceviche is 50% off even if it is not cooked,\njust as the best reading of ISDA is that ANCs are Indian tribes\neven if they are not federally recognized. Any grammatical\nawkwardness involved in the recognized-as-eligible clause skipping\nover the Alaska clause pales in comparison to the incongruity of\nforever excluding all ANCs from an \u201cIndian tribe\u201d definition whose\nmost prominent feature is that it specifically includes them.DRespondents make a few final arguments to\npersuade the Court that ANCs are not Indian tribes under ISDA. None\nsucceeds.Respondents argue first that the ANCs\nmisrepresent how meaningful a role they play under ISDA because the\nactual number of ISDA contracts held by ANCs is negligible. The\nCourt does not have the record before it to determine the exact\nnumber and nature of ISDA contracts held by ANCs or their\ndesignees, either historically or currently. The point is largely\nirrelevant, however. No one would argue that a federally recognized\ntribe was not an Indian tribe under ISDA just because it had never\nentered into an ISDA contract. The same is true for ANCs. To the\nextent respondents argue that ruling for them would be of little\npractical consequence given the small number of ISDA contracts held\nby ANCs, quantity is not the only issue. For example, CIRI\ncontracts through a designee to provide healthcare to thousands of\nAlaska Natives in Anchorage and the Matanuska-Susitna Valley. Brief\nfor CIRI asAmicus Curiae9. The loss of CIRI\u2019s ability\nalone to contract under ISDA would have significant effects on the\nmany Alaska Natives it currently serves.[10]Respondents further argue that treating ANCs as\nIndian tribes would complicate the administration of ISDA. If an\nISDA contract will benefit multiple Indian tribes, each such tribe\nhas to agree to the contract before it can go into effect. 25\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a75304(l). Because membership in ANCs and\nfederally recognized tribes often overlap, respondents argue that\nANCs will be able to veto any ISDA contract sought by a federally\nrecognized tribe in Alaska.Without discounting the possibility of\nadministrative burdens, this concern is overstated. The Executive\nBranch has treated ANCs as Indian tribes for 45 years, yet\nrespondents point to no evidence of such a problem ever having\narisen. If such a problem does arise, moreover, the Interior\nDepartment may be able to craft an administrative solution. Cf. 46\nFed. Reg. 27178, 27179 (1981) (Indian Health Service regulations\nestablishing an \u201corder of precedence\u201d among Alaskan entities \u201c[f]or\nthe purposes of contracting under\u201d ISDA and requiring authorizing\nresolutions from \u201c[v]illages, as the smallest tribal units under\u201d\nANCSA).Respondents also warn that blessing ANCs\u2019 status\nunder ISDA will give them ammunition to press for participation in\nthe many statutes besides the CARES Act that incorporate ISDA\u2019s\n\u201cIndian tribe\u201d definition. See,e.g., Indian Health Care\nImprovement Act, \u00a74(d), 90Stat. 1401; Native American Housing\nAssistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996, \u00a74(12)(B), 110Stat.\n4019\u20134020; Indian Tribal Energy Development and Self-Determination\nAct of 2005, [Title V of the Energy Policy Act of 2005], \u00a7503(a),\n119Stat. 764\u2013765.As the Government notes, however, there may well\nbe statutes that incorporate ISDA\u2019s \u201cIndian tribe\u201d definition but\nexclude ANCs from participation in other ways. See Brief for\nFederal Petitioner 33\u201334 (citing,e.g., 7 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7\u00a71639o(2), 1639p(a)(1) (defining \u201cIndian tribe\u201d to incorporate the\nISDA definition, but also requiring participants to exercise\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018regulatory authority over .\u00a0.\u00a0. territory of the\nIndian tribe\u2019\u00a0\u201d)). Moreover, this concern cuts both ways. If\nrespondents\u2019 reading prevailed, ANCs would presumably be excluded\nfrom all other statutes incorporating ISDA\u2019s definition, even those\nunder which ANCs have long benefited. That includes the Indian\nTribal Energy Development and Self-Determination Act of 2005, under\nwhich ANCs have received millions of dollars of energy assistance.\nSee Brief for Federal Petitioner 33. That also includes NAHASDA,\nwhich, as discussed, creates a housing block grant program under\nwhich the regional ANCs are some of the biggest recipients in\nAlaska. Seesupra, at 17\u201318. Currently, over 10,000 Alaskans\nlive in housing units built, improved, or managed by these regional\nauthorities. See Brief for Association of Alaska Housing\nAuthorities asAmicus Curiae15.All told, the Court\u2019s decision today does not\n\u201cvest ANCs with new and untold tribal powers,\u201d as respondents fear.\nBrief for Respondents Confederated Tribes of Chehalis Reservation\net al. 54. It merely confirms the powers Congress expressly\nafforded ANCs and that the Executive Branch has long understood\nANCs to possess.IIIAlmost everyone agrees that if ANCs are Indian\ntribes under ISDA, they are eligible for funding under Title V of\nthe CARES Act. If Congress did not want to make ANCs eligible for\nCARES Act funding, its decision to incorporate ISDA\u2019s \u201cIndian\ntribe\u201d definition into the CARES Act would be inexplicable. Had\nCongress wished to limit CARES Act funding to federally recognized\ntribes, it could simply have cross-referenced the List Act instead,\nas it had in numerous statutes before.[11] Instead, Congress invoked a definition that\nexpressly includes ANCs (and has been understood for decades to\ninclude them). Today\u2019s ruling merely gives effect to that\ndecision.Nevertheless, the Ute Indian Tribe of the Uintah\nand Ouray Reservation argues that the CARES Act excludes ANCs\nregardless of whether they are Indian tribes under ISDA. Recall\nthat the CARES Act allocates money to \u201cTribal governments.\u201d 42\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7801(a)(2)(B). A \u201cTribal government\u201d is \u201cthe\nrecognized governing body of an Indian tribe.\u201d \u00a7801(g)(5).\nAccording to the Utes, ANCs do not have a \u201crecognized governing\nbody\u201d because that term applies to the governing body of a\nfederally recognized tribe alone.As the Utes implicitly acknowledge, however,\nfederal recognition is usually discussed in relation to tribes, not\ntheir governing bodies. Brief for Respondent Ute Indian Tribe of\nthe Uintah and Ouray Reservation 13 (\u201cThe recognized relationship\nis a political relationship between the United States and the\ntribe\u201d); see also,e.g., note following 25\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a75130, p.\u00a0678 (\u201c\u00a0\u2018[T]he United State\nhas a trust responsibility to recognized Indian tribes, maintains a\ngovernment-to-government relationships with those tribes, and\nrecognizes the sovereignty of those tribes\u2019\u00a0\u201d). In addition,\nthe CARES Act\u2019s use of the term \u201crecognized governing body\u201d is\nborrowed from ISDA itself, which lists the \u201crecognized governing\nbody\u201d of an Indian tribe as one type of \u201ctribal organization\u201d\nempowered to contract with the government on the tribe\u2019s behalf.\n\u00a75304(l). In the ISDA context, this term has long been\nunderstood to apply to an ANC\u2019s board of directors, the ANC\u2019s\ngoverning body as a matter of corporate law. See,e.g., App.\n45 (An ANC\u2019s \u201cboard of directors .\u00a0.\u00a0. is its \u2018governing\nbody\u2019\u00a0\u201d); see also Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, at 219 (defining\n\u201cBoard of Directors\u201d as \u201c[t]he governing body of a private\ncorporation\u201d). Indeed, respondents do not dispute that the plain\nmeaning of \u201crecognized governing body\u201d covers an ANC\u2019s board of\ndirectors.[12]Looking to the plain meaning of \u201crecognized\ngoverning body\u201d makes even more sense because nothing in either the\nCARES Act or ISDA suggests that the term \u201crecognized governing\nbody\u201d places additional limits on the kinds of Indian tribes\neligible to benefit under the statutes. In both laws, the term\ninstead pinpoints the particular entity that will receive funding\non behalf of an Indian tribe. See 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7801(g)(5);\n25 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a75304(l). Because ANCs are Indian\ntribes within the meaning of the CARES Act, an ANC\u2019s board of\ndirectors is a \u201crecognized governing body\u201d eligible to receive\nfunding under Title V of the Act.IVThe Court today affirms what the Federal\nGovernment has maintained for almost half a century: ANCs are\nIndian tribes under ISDA. For that reason, they are Indian tribes\nunder the CARES Act and eligible for Title V funding. The judgment\nof the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit is\nreversed, and the cases are remanded for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.Notes1*Justice Alito joins Parts I,\nII\u2013C, II\u2013D, III, and IV of this opinion.2There were some\nexceptions. Congress created by statute two Alaska Native\nreservations: the Annette Islands Reserve in 1891 and the Klukwan\nReserve in 1957. See Act of Mar. 3, 1891, \u00a715, 26Stat. 1101; Act of\nSept. 2, 1957, Pub. L. 85\u2013271, 71Stat. 596. Under the 1936\nAmendment to the Indian Reorganization Act, ch. 254, 49Stat. 1250,\nsix further reservations were formed. See Letter from T.\nSansonetti, Solicitor of the U.\u00a0S. Dept. of Interior, to M.\nLujan, Jr., Secretary of Interior 33 (Jan. 11, 1993). Alaska also\nsaw the creation of certain \u201cexecutive order reserves,\u201d which were\nmore limited in purpose and scope and, like all reserves in Alaska\nbesides the Annette Islands Reserve, were ultimately revoked by the\nAlaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA). See generally D. Case\n& D. Voluck, Alaska Natives and Americans Laws 85\u2013112 (3d ed.\n2012).3In 1990, Congress made\n\u201ctechnical corrections\u201d to ISDA. S. Rep. No. 101\u2013226, p.\u00a010\n(1989). Relevant here, Congress inserted a comma after the \u201cIndian\ntribe\u201d definition\u2019s reference to ANCSA, bringing the definition to\nwhat it is today. Act of May 24, 1990, \u00a72(a)(1), 104Stat.\n206.4The Court addresses the\narguments of that one Tribe in Part III,infra.5Indeed, \u201crecognition\u201d is\nnot even the sole term used to describe tribes with which the\nUnited States maintains a government-to-government relationship;\n\u201cacknowledgement\u201d is often used for that same purpose. See 1 F.\nCohen, Handbook of Federal Indian Law \u00a73.02[3] (N. Newton ed. 2012)\n(\u201cFederal acknowledgement or recognition of an Indian group\u2019s legal\nstatus as a tribe is a formal political act confirming the tribe\u2019s\nexistence as a distinct political society, and institutionalizing\nthe government-to-government relationship between the tribe and the\nfederal government\u201d). For instance, in 1978, three years after\nISDA\u2019s enactment, the Bureau of Indian Affairs adopted \u201cprocedures\nfor acknowledging that certain American Indian tribes exist.\u201d 43\nFed. Reg. 39361 (1978). To this day, applications to become a\nfederally recognized tribe are made to the Office of Federal\nAcknowledgement, and the Interior Department still uses\n\u201crecognized\u201d and \u201cacknowledged\u201d somewhat interchangeably. See,e.g.,86 Fed. Reg. 7554 (2021) (\u201cPublished below is an\nupdated list of federally acknowledged Indian\nTribes\u201d).6The dissent reads the\ncongressional findings to ISDA as providing a textual clue that\ngovernment-to-government recognition is required. Seepost,at 7 (opinion of Gorsuch, J.) (\u201cWhen Congress passed ISDA, it\nsought to provide Indians \u2018meaningful leadership roles\u2019 that are\n\u2018crucial to the realization of self-government\u2019\u00a0\u201d (citing 25\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a75301)). As already explained, however,supra,at 10\u201311, allowing ANCs to contract under ISDA,\nnotwithstanding their lack of political recognition, is entirely\nconsistent with that statute\u2019s stated objective of \u201cestablish[ing]\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. a meaningful Indian self-determination policy.\u201d\n\u00a75301(b). Congress also designed ANCSA to be \u201cin conformity with\nthe real economic and social needs of Natives\u201d and to facilitate\n\u201cmaximum participation by Natives in decisions affecting their\nrights and property.\u201d 43 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71601(b). ANCs are the\nvehicles Congress created to further that policy of\nself-determination. Accord, S. Conf. Rep. No. 92\u2013581, p. 37 (1971)\n(\u201c[T]he creation of Regional and Village Corporations\u201d are part of\n\u201ca policy of self-determination on the part of the Alaska Native\npeople\u201d).7In so holding, the Court\ndoes not decide whether the language of the recognized-as-eligible\nclause has been used as a term of art in other statutes subsequent\nto ISDA\u2019s enactment.8That doubt was resolved\nin the villages\u2019 favor in 1993. See 58 Fed. Reg.\n54365.9Respondents also point to\na 1996 bill that would have \u201cdeemed\u201d one regional ANC, CIRI, \u201can\nIndian tribal entity for the purpose of federal programs for which\nIndians are eligible because of their status as Indians\u201d and would\nhave mandated that CIRI be \u201cspecifically include[d]\u201d \u201con any list\nthat designates federally recognized Indian tribes.\u201d H. R. 3662,\n104th Cong., 2d Sess., \u00a7\u00a7121(a)\u2013(b) (1996). By its terms, the bill\nwould not have entered CIRI into a government-to-government\nrelationship with the United States; it merely would have made CIRI\neligible for all federal Indian programs available to federally\nrecognized tribes. In any event, it is hard to make too much of a\nfailed bill. SeeUnited Statesv.Craft,535 U.S.\n274, 287 (2002) (\u201c[F]ailed legislative proposals are a\nparticularly dangerous ground on which to rest an interpretation of\na prior statute\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).10Respondents argue that CIRI\u2019s\nhealthcare services would survive a ruling in respondents\u2019 favor,\nbecause CIRI\u2019s ISDA contract is provided for \u201cby separate statute.\u201d\nBrief for Respondents Confederated Tribes of Chehalis Reservation\net al. 52. As discussed, after CIRI entered into an ISDA contract\nto provide healthcare benefits, a group of Alaskan tribes sued. SeeCook Inlet Treaty Tribesv.Shalala,166 F.3d 986, 988 (CA9 1999). Congress then passed a bill to\nmoot the dispute. Department of the Interior and Related Agencies\nAppropriations Act, 1998, \u00a7325(a), 111Stat. 1597\u20131598. It is not\nentirely clear whether this bill means that CIRI\u2019s ISDA contract\nwould survive a ruling that ANCs are not Indian tribes under ISDA.\nBut the fact that Congress intervened to ensure that a regional ANC\ncould more easily contract under ISDA is, if anything, further\nindication that the Court\u2019s ruling today is the correct\none.11See,e.g.,Indian Arts and Crafts Amendments Act of 2010,\n\u00a7203(a)(2), 124Stat. 2263 (\u201cThe term \u2018Indian tribe\u2019 has the meaning\ngiven the term in section 102 of the Federally Recognized Indian\nTribe List Act of 1994\u201d); Helping Expedite and Advance Responsible\nTribal Home Ownership Act of 2012, \u00a72, 126Stat. 1150 (same);\nDeadbeat Parents Punishment Act of 1998, \u00a72, 112Stat. 619\n(same).12The\nUtes rely also onSeldovia Native Assn., Inc.v.Lujan, 904 F.2d 1335 (CA9 1990).Seldovianever\ndiscussed the term \u201crecognized governing body\u201d and concerned\nwhether ANCs are Indian tribes for purposes of Circuit precedent\nconstruing the Eleventh Amendment.Id.,at\n1350.",
