S. ____ (2011)SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESNO. 09-1088VINCENT CULLEN, ACTING WARDEN, PETITIONERv.SCOTT LYNN PINHOLSTERon writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the ninth circuit[April 4, 2011]Justice Sotomayor, with whom\nJustice Ginsburg and Justice Kagan join as to Part II,\ndissenting.Some habeas petitioners are\nunable to develop the fac-tual basis of their claims in state court\nthrough no fault of\u00a0their own. Congress recognized as much\nwhen it enacted the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act\nof 1996 (AEDPA), 110 Stat. 1214, and permitted therein the\nintroduction of new evidence in federal habeas proceed-ings in\ncertain limited circumstances. See 28 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a72254(e)(2).\nUnder the Court\u2019s novel interpretation of \u00a72254(d)(1), however,\nfederal courts must turn a blind eye to new evidence in deciding\nwhether a petitioner has satisfied \u00a72254(d)(1)\u2019s threshold obstacle\nto federal habeas relief\u2014even when it is clear that the petitioner\nwould be entitled to relief in light of that evidence. In reading\nthe statute to \u201ccompe[l]\u201d this harsh result,ante, at 9,\nthe Court ignores a key textual difference between \u00a7\u00a72254(d)(1) and\n2254(d)(2) and discards the previous understanding in our\nprecedents that new evidence can, in fact, inform the \u00a72254(d)(1)\ninquiry. I therefore dissent from the Court\u2019s first holding.I also disagree with the Court that, even if\nthe \u00a72254(d)(1) analysis is limited to the state-court record,\nrespondent Scott Pinholster failed to demonstrate that the\nCalifornia Supreme Court\u2019s decision denying his\nineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim was an unreasonable\napplication ofStricklandv.Washington,466 U. S. 668(1984).\nThere is no reason for the majority to decide whether the\n\u00a72254(d)(1) analysis is limited to the state-court record because\nPinholster satisfied \u00a72254(d)(1) on either the state- or\nfederal-court record.IThe Court first holds that, in\ndetermining whether a state-court decision is an unreasonable\napplication of Supreme Court precedent under \u00a72254(d)(1), \u201creview \u2026\nis limited to the record that was before the state court that\nadjudicated the claim on the merits.\u201dAnte, at 9. New\nevidence adduced at a federal evidentiary hearing is\nnow\u00a0irrelevant to determining whether a petitioner has\nsatisfied \u00a72254(d)(1). This holding is unnecessary to pro-mote\nAEDPA\u2019s purposes, and it is inconsistent with the provision\u2019s text,\nthe structure of the statute, and our precedents.ATo understand the significance of\nthe majority\u2019s holding, it is important to view the issue in\ncontext. AEDPA\u2019s entire structure\u2014which gives state courts the\nopportunity to decide factual and legal questions in the first\ninstance\u2014ensures that evidentiary hearings in federal habeas\nproceedings are very rare. See N. King, F. Cheesman, & B.\nOstrom, Final Technical Report: Habeas Litigation in U. S. District\nCourts 35\u201336 (2007) (evidentiary hearings under AEDPA occur in 0.4\npercent of noncapital cases and 9.5 percent of capital cases). Even\nabsent the new restriction created by today\u2019s holding, AEDPA erects\nmultiple hurdles to a state prisoner\u2019s ability to introduce new\nevidence in a federal habeas proceeding.First, \u201c[u]nder the exhaustion\nrequirement, a habeas petitioner challenging a state conviction\nmust first attempt to present his claim in state court.\u201dHarringtonv.Richter, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011)\n(slip op., at 13); see also \u00a72254(b)(1)(A). With certain narrow\nexceptions, federal courts cannot consider a claim at all, let\nalone accept new evidence relevant to the claim, if it has not been\nexhausted in state court.[Footnote\n1] The exhaustion requirement thus reserves to state courts the\nfirst opportunity to resolve factual disputes relevant to a state\nprisoner\u2019s claim. SeeO\u2019Sullivanv.Boerckel,526 U. S. 838,\n845 (1999).Second, the exhaustion requirement is\n\u201ccomplement[ed]\u201d by the standards set forth in \u00a72254(d).Harrington, 562 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 14). Under\nthis provision, a federal court may not grant habeas relief on any\n\u201cclaim that was adjudicated on the merits in State court\nproceedings\u201d unless the adjudication\u201c(1) resulted in a decision that\nwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of,\nclearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court\nof the United States; or\u201c(2) resulted in a decision that was based on\nan unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence\npresented in the State court proceeding.\u201dThese standards \u201ccontrol whether to grant habeas\nrelief.\u201dSchrirov.Landrigan,550 U. S. 465, 474\n(2007). Accordingly, we have said, if the factual allegations a\npetitioner seeks to prove at an evidentiary hearing would not\nsatisfy these standards, there is no reason for a hearing. Seeid., at 481. In such a case, the district court may\nexercise its \u201cdiscretion to deny an evidentiary hearing.\u201dIbid.;see alsoinfra, at 13\u201314. This approach\nmakes eminent sense: If district courts held evidentiary hearings\nwithout first asking whether the evidence the petitioner seeks to\npresent would satisfy AEDPA\u2019s demanding standards, they would\nneedlessly prolong federal habeas proceedings.Third, even when a petitioner seeks to\nintroduce new evidence that would entitle him to relief, AEDPA\nprohibits him from doing so, except in a narrow range of cases,\nunless he \u201cmade a reasonable attempt, in light of the information\navailable at the time, to investigate and pursue claims in state\ncourt.\u201dWilliamsv.Taylor,529 U. S. 420, 435 (2000)(Michael\nWilliams). Thus, \u00a72254(e)(2) provides:\u201cIf the applicant has failed to develop the factual\nbasis of a claim in State court proceedings, the court shall not\nhold an evidentiary hearing on the claim unless the applicant shows\nthat\u2014\u201c(A) the claim relies on\u2014\u201c(i) a new rule of constitutional law, made\nretroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court,\nthat was previously unavailable; or\u201c(ii) a factual predicate that could not have\nbeen previously discovered through the exercise of due diligence;\nand\u201c(B) the facts underlying the claim would be\nsufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that but\nfor constitutional error, no reasonable factfinder would have found\nthe applicant guilty of the underlying offense.\u201dInMichael Williams, we construed the\nopening clause of this provision\u2014which triggers the bar on\nevidentiary hearings\u2014to apply when \u201cthere is lack of diligence, or\nsome greater fault, attributable to the prisoner or the prisoner\u2019s\ncounsel.\u201d[Footnote 2]Id., at 432. AEDPA thus bars an evidentiary hearing for a\nnondiligent petitioner unless the petitioner can satisfy both\n\u00a7\u00a72254(e)(2)(A) and (B), which few petitioners can. Section\n2254(e)(2) in this way incentivizes state petitioners to develop\nthe factual basis of their claims in state court.To the limited extent that federal evidentiary\nhearings are available under AEDPA, they ensure that petitioners\nwho diligently developed the factual basis of their claims in state\ncourt, discovered new evidence after the state-court proceeding,\nand cannot return to state court retain the ability to access the\nGreat Writ. Seeante, at 2 (Alito, J., concurring in part\nand concurring in judgment). \u201cWhen Congress codified new rules\ngoverning this previously judicially managed area of law, it did so\nwithout losing sight of the fact that the \u2018writ of habeas corpus\nplays a vital role in protecting constitutional rights.\u2019\u00a0\u201dHollandv.Florida, 560 U. S. ___, ___ (2010)\n(slip op., at 16) (quotingSlackv.McDaniel,529 U. S. 473,\n483 (2000)). Allowing a petitioner to introduce new evidence at a\nhearing in the limited circumstance permitted by \u00a72254(e)(2) does\nnot upset the balance that Congress struck in AEDPA between the\nstate and federal courts. By construing \u00a72254(d)(1) to do the work\nof other provisions in AEDPA, the majority has subverted Congress\u2019\ncareful balance of responsibilities. It has also created\nunnecessarily a brand-new set of procedural complexities that lower\ncourts will have to confront.[Footnote 3]BThe majority\u2019s interpretation of\n\u00a72254(d)(1) finds no support in the provision\u2019s text or the\nstatute\u2019s structure as a whole.1Section 2254(d)(1) requires\ndistrict courts to ask whether a state-court adjudication on the\nmerits \u201cresulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an\nunreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as\ndetermined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d Because this\nprovision uses \u201cbackward-looking language\u201d\u2014i.e.,\npast-tense verbs\u2014the majority believes that it limits review to the\nstate-court record.Ante, at 9. But both \u00a7\u00a72254(d)(1) and\n2254(d)(2) use \u201cbackward-looking language,\u201d and \u00a72254(d)(2)\u2014unlike\n\u00a72254(d)(1)\u2014expressly directs district courts to base their review\non \u201cthe evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d If use\nof the past tense were sufficient to indicate Congress\u2019 intent to\nrestrict analysis to the state-court record, the phrase \u201cin light\nof the evidence presented in the State court proceeding\u201d in\n\u00a72254(d)(2) would be superfluous. The majority\u2019s construction of\n\u00a72254(d)(1) fails to give meaning to Congress\u2019 decision to include\nlanguage referring to the evidence presented to the state court in\n\u00a72254(d)(2). Cf.Batesv.United States,522 U. S. 23, 29\u201330\n(1997) (\u201cWhere Congress includes particular language in one section\nof a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is\ngenerally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely\nin the disparate inclusion or exclusion\u201d (internal quotation marks\nand brackets omitted)).Ignoring our usual \u201creluctan[ce]\nto treat statutory terms as surplusage in any setting,\u201dTRW\nInc.v.Andrews,534 U. S. 19, 31 (2001)\n(internal quotation marks omitted), the majority characterizes the\nphrase appearing in \u00a72254(d)(2) as mere \u201cclarifying language,\u201dante, at 12, n.\u00a07. It speculates that \u201c[t]he omission\nof clarifying language from \u00a72254(d)(1) just as likely reflects\nCongress\u2019 belief that such language was unnecessary as it does\nanything else.\u201dAnte, at 12\u201313, n.\u00a07. The argument\nthat this phrase is merely \u201cclarifying\u201d might have more force,\nhowever, had Congress included this phrase in \u00a72254(d)(1) but not\nin \u00a72254(d)(2). As between the two provisions, \u00a72254(d)(2)\u2014which\nrequires review of the state court\u2019s \u201cdetermination of the\nfacts\u201d\u2014more logically depends on the facts presented to the state\ncourt. Because this provision needs less clarification on this\npoint than \u00a72254(d)(1), it is all the more telling that Congress\nincluded this phrase in \u00a72254(d)(2) but elected to exclude it from\n\u00a72254(d)(1).Unlike my colleagues in the majority, I refuse\nto assume that Congress simply engaged in sloppy drafting. The\ninclusion of this phrase in \u00a72254(d)(2)\u2014coupled with its omission\nfrom \u00a72254(d)(2)\u2019s partner provision, \u00a72254(d)(1)\u2014provides strong\nreason to think that Congress did not intend for the \u00a72254(d)(1)\nanalysis to be limited categorically to \u201cthe evidence presented in\nthe State court proceeding.\u201d2The \u201c\u00a0\u2018broader context of\nthe statute as a whole,\u2019\u00a0\u201dante, at 9 (quotingRobinsonv.Shell Oil Co.,519 U. S. 337, 341\n(1997)), reinforces this conclusion. In particular, Congress\u2019\ndecision to include in AEDPA a provision, \u00a72254(e)(2), that permits\nfederal evidentiary hearings in certain circumstances provides\nfurther evidence that Congress did not intend to limit the\n\u00a72254(d)(1) inquiry to the state-court record in every case.We have long recognized that some\ndiligent habeas petitioners are unable to develop all of the facts\nsupporting their claims in state court.[Footnote 4] As discussed above, in enacting AEDPA,\nCongress generally barred evidentiary hearings for petitioners who\ndid not \u201cexercise diligence in pursuing their claims\u201d in state\ncourt.Michael Williams, 529 U. S., at 436; see also\n\u00a72254(e)(2). Importantly, it did not impose any express limit on\nevidentiary hearings for petitioners who had been diligent in state\ncourt. Seeid., at 436 (\u201c[T]he statute does not equate\nprisoners who exercise diligence in pursuing their claims with\nthose who do not\u201d). For those petitioners, Congress left the\ndecision to hold a hearing \u201cto the sound discretion of district\ncourts.\u201dLandrigan, 550 U. S., at 473.Faced with situations in which a diligent\npetitioner offers additional evidence in federal court, the courts\nof appeals have taken two approaches to applying \u00a72254(d)(1). Some\ncourts have held that when a federal court admits new evidence\nsupporting a claim adjudicated on the merits in state court,\n\u00a72254(d)(1) does not apply at all and the federal court may review\nthe claimde novo. Seeante, at 12;Hollandv.Jackson,542 U. S. 649, 653 (2004)(per\ncuriam);see,e.g.,Winstonv.Kelly, 592 F.\u00a03d 535, 555\u2013556 (CA4 2010). I agree\nwith the majority\u2019s rejection of this approach. Seeante,\nat 12. It would undermine the comity principles motivating AEDPA to\ndecline to defer to a state-court adjudication of a claim because\nthe state court, through no fault of its own, lacked all the\nrelevant evidence.[Footnote\n5]Other courts of appeals, including the court\nbelow, have struck a more considered balance. These courts have\nheld that \u00a72254(d)(1) continues to apply but that new evidence\nproperly presented in a federal hearing is relevant to the\nreasonableness of the state-court decision. SeePinholsterv.Ayers, 590 F.\u00a03d 651, 668 (CA9 2009) (en banc)\n(\u201cIf the evidence is admissible underMichael Williamsor\n\u00a72254(e)(2), and if it does not render the petitioner\u2019s claims\nunexhausted \u2026\u00a0, then it is properly considered in evaluating\nwhether the legal conclusion reached by the state habeas court was\na reasonable application of Supreme Court law\u201d); accord,Wilsonv.Mazzuca, 570 F.\u00a03d 490, 500 (CA2\n2009);Pecorarov.Walls, 286 F.\u00a03d 439, 443\n(CA7 2002);Valdezv.Cockrell, 274 F.\u00a03d\n941, 952 (CA5 2001). This approach accommodates the competing\ngoals, reflected in \u00a7\u00a72254(d) and 2254(e)(2), of according\ndeference to reasonable state-court decisions and preserving the\nopportunity for diligent petitioners to present evidence to the\nfederal court when they were unable to do so in state court.The majority charts a third, novel course\nthat, so far as I am aware, no court of appeals has adopted:\n\u00a72254(d)(1) continues to apply when a petitioner has additional\nevidence that he was unable to present to the state court, but the\ndistrict court cannot consider that evidence in deciding whether\nthe petitioner has satisfied \u00a72254(d)(1). The problem with this\napproach is its potential to bar federal habeas relief for diligent\nhabeas petitioners who cannot present new evidence to a state\ncourt.Consider, for example, a petitioner who\ndiligently attempted in state court to develop the factual basis of\na claim that prosecutors withheld exculpatory witness statements in\nviolation ofBradyv.Maryland,373 U. S. 83(1963). The state court\ndenied relief on the ground that the withheld evidence then known\ndid not rise to the level of materiality required underBrady. Before the time for filing a federal habeas\npetition has expired, however, a state court orders the State to\ndisclose additional documents the petitioner had timely requested\nunder the State\u2019s public records Act. The disclosed documents\nreveal that the State withheld other exculpatory witness\nstatements, but state law would not permit the petitioner to\npresent the new evidence in a successive petition.[Footnote 6]Under our precedent, if the petitioner had not\npresented hisBradyclaim to the state court at all, his\nclaim would be deemed defaulted and the petitioner could attempt to\nshow cause and prejudice to overcome the default. SeeMichael\nWilliams, 529 U. S., at 444; see also n. 1,supra.\nIf, however, the new evidence merely bolsters aBradyclaim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court, it is\nunclear how the petitioner can obtain federal habeas relief after\ntoday\u2019s holding. What may have been a reasonable decision on the\nstate-court record may no longer be reasonable in light of the new\nevidence. SeeKylesv.Whitley,514 U. S. 419, 436\n(1995) (materiality ofBradyevidence is viewed\n\u201ccollectively, not item by item\u201d). Because the state court\nadjudicated the petitioner\u2019sBradyclaim on the merits,\n\u00a72254(d)(1) would still apply. Yet, under the majority\u2019s\ninterpretation of \u00a72254(d)(1), a federal court is now prohibited\nfrom considering the new evidence in determining the reasonableness\nof the state-court decision.The majority\u2019s interpretation of \u00a72254(d)(1)\nthus suggests the anomalous result that petitioners with new claims\nbased on newly obtained evidence can obtain federal habeas relief\nif they can show cause and prejudice for their default but\npetitioners with newly obtained evidence supporting a claim\nadjudicated on the merits in state court cannot obtain federal\nhabeas relief if they cannot first satisfy \u00a72254(d)(1) without the\nnew evidence. That the majority\u2019s interpretation leads to this\nanomaly is good reason to conclude that its interpretation is\nwrong. SeeKeeneyv.Tamayo-Reyes,504 U. S. 1, 7\u20138 (1992) (\u201c[I]t is \u2026\nirrational to distinguish between failing to properly assert a\nfederal claim in state court and failing in state court to properly\ndevelop such a claim\u201d).The majority responds to this anomaly by\nsuggesting that my hypothetical petitioner \u201cmay well [have] a new\nclaim.\u201d[Footnote 7]Ante, at 14, n.\u00a010. This suggestion is puzzling. New\nevidence does not usually give rise to a new claim; it merely\nprovides additional proof of a claim already adjudicated on the\nmerits.[Footnote 8] The\nmajority presumably means to\u00a0suggest that the petitioner might\nbe able to obtain federal-court review of his new evidence if he\ncan show cause and\u00a0prejudice for his failure to present the\n\u201cnew\u201d claim to a state court. In that scenario, however, the\nfederal court would review the purportedly \u201cnew\u201d claimde\nnovo. The majority\u2019s approach thus threatens to replace\ndeferential review of new evidence under \u00a72254(d)(1) withde\nnovoreview of new evidence in the form of \u201cnew\u201d\nclaims.[Footnote 9] Because it\nis unlikely that Congress intendedde novoreview\u2014the\nresult suggested by the majority\u2019s opinion\u2014it must have intended\nfor district courts to consider newly discovered evidence in\nconducting the \u00a72254(d)(1) analysis.The majority\u2019s reading of \u00a72254(d)(1) appears\nultimately to rest on its understanding that state courts must have\nthe first opportunity to adjudicate habeas petitioners\u2019 claims. Seeante, at 9\u201310 (\u201cIt would be contrary to [AEDPA\u2019s\nexhaustion requirement] to allow a petitioner to overcome an\nadverse state-court decision with new evidence introduced in a\nfederal habeas court and reviewed by that court in the first\ninstance effectively denovo\u201d).[Footnote 10] Justice Breyer takes the same position.\nSeeante, at 2 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting\nin part) (AEDPA is designed \u201cto give the State a first opportunity\nto consider most matters\u201d). I fully agree that habeas petitioners\nmust attempt to present evidence to state courts in the first\ninstance, as does Justice Alito, seeante, at 2. Where I\ndisagree with the majority is in my understanding that \u00a72254(e)(2)\nalready accomplishes this result. By reading \u00a72254(d)(1) to do the\nwork of \u00a72254(e)(2), the majority gives \u00a72254(e)(2) an unnaturally\ncramped reading. As a result, the majority either has foreclosed\nhabeas relief for diligent petitioners who, through no fault of\ntheir own, were unable to present exculpatory evidence to the state\ncourt that adjudicated their claims or has created a new set of\nprocedural complexities for the lower courts to navigate to ensure\nthe availability of the Great Writ for diligent petitioners.3These considerations lead me to\nagree with the courts of appeals that have concluded that a federal\ncourt should assess the reasonableness of a state court\u2019s\napplication of clearly established federal law under \u00a72254(d)(1) in\nlight of evidence properly admitted in a federal evidentiary\nhearing. There is nothing \u201cstrange\u201d about this approach.Ante, at 10. Under \u00a72254(d)(1), federal courts routinely\nengage in analysis that the state court itself might never have\nconducted or did not conduct. For example, when a state court\nsummarily denies a claim without explanation, as the California\nSupreme Court did here, district courts must deny habeas relief\npursuant to \u00a72254(d)(1) so long as \u201cthere is any reasonable\nargument\u201d supporting the denial of the petitioner\u2019s claim.Harrington, 562 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 16). We\nlikewise ask whether a state-court decision unreasonably applied\nclearly established federal law when the state court issued a\nreasoned decision but failed to cite federal law altogether. SeeEarlyv.Packer,537 U. S. 3, 8 (2002)(per curiam). Determining whether a state court could\nreasonably have denied a petitioner relief in light of newly\ndiscovered evidence is not so different than determining whether\nthere is any reasonable basis for a state court\u2019s unreasoned\ndecision.Admittedly, the text of\n\u00a72254(d)(1), standing alone, does not compel either reading of that\nprovision. But construing \u00a72254(d)(1) to permit consideration of\nevidence properly introduced in federal court best accords with the\ntext of \u00a72254(d)(2) and AEDPA\u2019s structure as a whole. By\ninterpreting \u00a72254(d)(1) to preventnondiligentpetitioners from gaming the system\u2014the very purpose of\n\u00a72254(e)(2)\u2014the majority potentially has put habeas relief out of\nreach fordiligentpetitioners with meritorious claims\nbased on new evidence.CThe majority claims that its\nholding is \u201cconsistent\u201d with our case law.Ante, at 10.\nQuite the opposite is true: Our cases reflect our previous\nunderstanding that evidence properly admitted pursuant to\n\u00a72254(e)(2) is relevant to the \u00a72254(d)(1) analysis.InLandrigan, JusticeThomas, the author of today\u2019s opinion, confirmed\nthis understanding of the interplay between \u00a7\u00a72254(d)(1) and\n2254(e)(2). As noted above, we admonished district courts to\nconsider whether a petitioner\u2019s allegations, if proved true, would\nsatisfy \u00a72254(d) in determining whether to grant a hearing. After\nhighlighting the deference owed to state courts under \u00a7\u00a72254(d) and\n2254(e)(1), we stated:\u201cIn deciding whether to grant an\nevidentiary hearing, a federal court must consider whether such a\nhearing could enable an applicant to prove the petition\u2019s factual\nallegations, which, if true, would entitle the applicant to federal\nhabeas relief. Because the deferential standards prescribed by\n\u00a72254 control whether to grant habeas relief, a federal court must\ntake into account those standards in deciding whether an\nevidentiary hearing is appropriate.\u201d 550 U. S., at 474 (citation\nomitted).By instructing district courts to\nconsider the \u00a72254(d) standards in deciding whether to grant a\nhearing, we must have understood that the evidence admitted at a\nhearing could be considered in the \u00a72254(d)(1) analysis. See Brief\nfor American Civil Liberties Union asAmicus Curiae9\n(\u201cThe whole point ofLandrigan\u2019s admonition that the court\nmust decide whether to hold a hearing with an eye on \u00a72254(d)(1) is\nthat some proffers of evidence will not justify federal\nfact-finding in view of \u00a72254(d)(1), but that other proffers of\nproofwill\u201d).[Footnote\n11]InMichael Williams,\nthe warden argued that \u00a72254(e)(2) bars an evidentiary hearing\nwhenever a petitioner was unable to develop the factual record in\nstate court, \u201cwhether or not through his own fault or neglect.\u201d 529\nU. S., at 430. Under the warden\u2019s argument, a petitioner who did\nnot develop the record in state court, whatever the reason, would\nbe barred from presenting evidence to the federal court. In\nrejecting that argument, we observed:\u201cA prisoner who developed his claim\nin state court and can prove the state court\u2019s decision was\n\u2018contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly\nestablished Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the\nUnited States,\u2019 is not barred from obtaining relief by \u00a72254(d)(1).\nIf the opening clause of \u00a72254(e)(2) covers a request for an\nevidentiary hearing on a claim which was pursued with diligence but\nremained undeveloped in state court because, for instance, the\nprosecution concealed the facts, a prisoner lacking clear and\nconvincing evidence of innocence could be barred from a hearing on\nthe claimeven if he could satisfy \u00a72254(d).\u201dId., at 434 (citation omitted; emphasis added).A petitioner in the latter situation\nwould almost certainly be unable to \u201csatisfy \u00a72254(d)\u201d without\nintroducing the concealed facts in federal court. This passage thus\nreflects our understanding that, in some circumstances, a\npetitioner might need an evidentiary hearing in federal court to\nprove the facts necessary to satisfy \u00a72254(d). To avoid foreclosing\nhabeas relief for such petitioners, we concluded that \u00a72254(e)(2)\ncould not bear the warden\u2019s \u201charsh reading,\u201d which essentially\nwould have held petitioners strictly at fault for their inability\nto develop the facts in state court.Ibid.The majority\ntoday gives an equally \u201charsh reading\u201d to \u00a72254(d)(1) to achieve\nthe result we rejected inMichael Williams.[Footnote 12]None of the other cases cited\nby the majority supports its result. InWilliamsv.Taylor,529\nU. S. 362(2000)(Terry Williams), we interpreted\n\u00a72254(d)(1) to ask whether the state-court decision \u201cidentifies the\ncorrect governing legal principle from this Court\u2019s decisions but\nunreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner\u2019s\ncase.\u201dId., at 413. However, we had no reason to decide\nwhether the \u00a72254(d)(1) inquiry was limited to the state-court\nrecord, as the District Court did not hold an evidentiary hearing\nin that case. Seeid., at 372.InHollandv.Jackson, we stated that \u201cwe have made clear that whether a\nstate court\u2019s decision was unreasonable must be assessed in light\nof the record the court had before it.\u201d 542 U. S., at 652. In the\nnext sentence, however, we observed that the evidence at issue\n\u201ccould have been the subject of an evidentiary hearing by the\nDistrict Court, but only if respondent was not at fault in failing\nto develop that evidence in state court.\u201dId., at 652\u2013653.\nWe proceeded to find that the evidence was not properly admitted\nunder \u00a72254(e)(2)beforeconcluding that the Court of\nAppeals had erred in its \u00a72254(d)(1) analysis.Id., at\n653; see alsoBradshawv.Richey,546 U. S. 74, 79 (2005)(per curiam).In sum, our cases reflect our\nrecognition that it is sometimes appropriate to consider new\nevidence in deciding whether a petitioner can satisfy \u00a72254(d)(1).\nIn reading our precedent to require the opposite conclusion, the\nmajority disregards the concerns that motivated our decision inMichael Williams:Some petitioners, even if diligent, may\nbe unable to develop the factual record in state court through no\nfault of their own. We should not interpret \u00a72254(d)(1) to\nforeclose these diligent petitioners from accessing the Great Writ\nwhen the state court will not consider the new evidence and could\nnot reasonably have reached the same conclusion with the new\nevidence before it.III also disagree\nwith the Court\u2019s conclusion that the Court of Appeals erred in\nholding that Pinholster had satisfied \u00a72254(d)(1) on the basis of\nthe state-court record.[Footnote\n13]AThe majority omits\ncritical details relating to the performance of Pinholster\u2019s trial\ncounsel, the mitigating evidence they failed to discover, and the\nhistory of these proceedings. I therefore highlight several aspects\nof the facts and history of this case.1After the jury\nreturned a guilty verdict, the court instructed the jury to return\nsix days later for the penalty phase. This prompted discussion at\nsidebar regarding whether the State had provided notice of its\nintent to offer aggravating evidence. Pinholster\u2019s court-appointed\nattorney, Wilbur Dettmar, argued that the State should be precluded\nfrom offering aggravating evidence:\u201cI am not presently prepared to\noffer anything by way of mitigation. If I was going to proceed on\nmitigation, the people would have the right to rebuttal with or\nwithout notice.\u201cI took the position, since the\npeople had not given notice,I had not prepared any evidence by\nway of mitigation. I would submit it on that basis.\u201d 52\nReporter\u2019s Tr. 7250 (hereinafter Tr.) (emphasis added).Undoubtedly anticipating that\ncounsel might need additional time to prepare an adequate\nmitigation defense, the court asked Dettmar whether a continuance\nwould be helpful in the event it ruled against him. He declined the\noffer on the spot, stating: \u201cI think we would probably still go\nforward on Monday. Clearly the one person that comes to mind is the\ndefendant\u2019s mother. How much beyond that I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t\nthink the pa[ss]age of time would make a great deal of difference.\u201dId., at 7257\u20137258. After hearing testimony, the court\ndenied Pinholster\u2019s motion to preclude aggravating\nevidence.At the penalty phase, defense\ncounsel called only one witness: Pinholster\u2019s mother, Burnice\nBrashear. Brashear testified that Pinholster \u201cnever really wanted\nfor anything at home too much\u201d and \u201chad everything normally\nmaterialwise that most people have.\u201dId., at 7395. She\nsaid that Pinholster was \u201cdifferent\u201d from his siblings, whom she\ncharacterized as \u201cbasically very good children.\u201dId., at\n7401\u20137402. Pinholster, she said, had a \u201cfriendly\u201d relationship with\nhis stepfather, although his stepfather \u201csometimes would lose his\ntemper\u201d with Pinholster, who \u201chad a mind of his own.\u201dId.,\nat 7392\u20137393; see alsoid., at 7293 (stating that his\nstepfather was \u201cat times\u201d \u201cabusive or near abusive\u201d).Brashear provided brief\ntestimony regarding Pinholster\u2019s childhood. She described two car\naccidents\u2014one when she ran over him in the driveway and one when he\nwent through the windshield.Id., at 7389\u20137391. She stated\nthat he started failing school in the first grade and that the\nschool eventually \u201csent him to [an] educationally handicapped\nclass.\u201dId., at 7393\u20137394. When Pinholster was 10, a\npsychologist recommended placing him in a mental institution, but\nshe \u201cdidn\u2019t think he was that far gone.\u201dId., at 7395. A\nfew years later, she testified, he spent six months in a state\nhospital for emotionally handicapped children.Id., at\n7402.According to Brashear,\nPinholster had suffered from epilepsy since age 18, when he was\nbeaten in jail.Id., at\u00a07397. She said that her\nfamily doctor, Dr. Dubin, had given him medication to treat the\nepilepsy.Ibid.Brashear also suggested that Pinholster\ndid not have long to live, stating that he had \u201ca chip in his head\nfloating around\u201d and that \u201cthey don\u2019t think\u2014he won\u2019t be here very\nmuch longer anyway.\u201d[Footnote\n14]Ibid.In closing argument, the\nprosecutor ridiculed Brashear\u2019s testimony. See 53id., at\n7442 (\u201cShe said his stepfather disciplined him. So what? I am sure\nyou have all disciplined your children. I was disciplined myself\u201d);ibid.(\u201cHe was run over by a car when he was three years\nold. That\u2019s very unfortunate. There is no evidence of any brain\ndamage. A lot of children get dropped, fall from their cribs or\nwhatever\u201d);id., at 7444\u20137445 (\u201cI submit to you that if\nthis defendant truly had epilepsy, \u2026 a doctor would have been\nbrought in to tell you that. Medical records, something\u201d). The\nprosecutor also highlighted Brashear\u2019s testimony about Pinholster\u2019s\nstable home environment, arguing, \u201cHe came from a good home. You\nheard that he was not a deprived child. Had many things going for\nhim, probably more than many children.\u201dId., at\n7442.Notwithstanding the meager\nmitigation case presented by Pinholster\u2019s counsel, it took the jury\ntwo days to reach a decision to sentence Pinholster to death. His\ncounsel later moved to modify the sentence to life imprisonment. In\ndenying the motion, the trial judge stated, \u201cThe evidence which the\ndefense offered concerning the defendant\u2019s extenuation was merely\nsome testimony from his mother that was not persuasive. His mother\ndid not, in the court\u2019s opinion, present any evidence which the\ncourt would find to be a moral justification or extenuation for his\nconduct. No witness supplied such evidence.\u201d 54id., at\n7514.2After his\nconviction and sentence were affirmed on appeal, Pinholster filed a\nhabeas petition in the California Supreme Court alleging, among\nother things, that his counsel had \u201cunreasonably failed to\ninvestigate, prepare and present available mitigating evidence\nduring penalty phase.\u201d Record ER\u2013103.Pinholster\u2019s\nstate-court petition included 121 exhibits. In a series of\ndeclarations, his trial attorney Harry Brainard (who had by then\nbeen disbarred) confirmed what Dettmar had forthrightly told the\ntrial court: Brainard and Dettmar neither expected nor prepared to\npresent mitigation evidence.[Footnote 15] Seeid., at ER\u2013333 (\u201cMr. Dettmar\nand I did not prepare a case in mitigation. We felt there would be\nno penalty phase hearing inasmuch as we did not receive written\nnotice of evidence in aggravation pursuant to Penal Code \u00a7190.3\u201d).\nBrainard further confirmed what was apparent from the mitigation\ncase they eventually put on: They conducted virtually no mitigation\ninvestigation. Seeid., at ER\u2013182 (\u201cI have no recollection\nof Mr. Dettmar having secured or reviewed any of Scott\u2019s medical\nrecords, nor did I see any of Scott\u2019s medical records. So far as I\nrecollect, neither Mr. Dettmar nor myself interviewed any of\nScott\u2019s previous medical providers\u201d);id., at ER\u2013183 (\u201cI\ndo not recall interviewing or attempting to interview Scott\u2019s\nfamily members or any other persons regarding penalty phase\ntestimony, except Mrs. Brashears[sic]\u201d);ibid.(\u201cI have no recollection of seeing or attempting to secure Scott\u2019s\nschool records, juvenile records, medical records, or records of\nprior placements\u201d);ibid.(\u201cI have no recollection of\ninterviewing or attempting to interview Scott\u2019s former school\nteachers, counselors, or juvenile officers\u201d).[Footnote 16]Statements by relatives (none\nof whom trial counsel had attempted to interview regarding\nPinholster\u2019s background) and documentary evidence revealed that the\npicture of Pinholster\u2019s family life painted by his mother at trial\nwas false. Pinholster was \u201craised in chaos and poverty.\u201dId., at ER\u2013312. A relative remembered seeing the children\nmix together flour and water in an attempt to get something to eat.\nPinholster\u2019s stepfather beat him several times a week, including at\nleast once with a two-by-four board. \u201cThere was so much violence in\n[the] home\u201d that Pinholster\u2019s brother \u201cdreaded coming home each\nday.\u201dId., at ER\u2013313. Pinholster\u2019s half sister was removed\nfrom the home as a result of a beating by his\nstepfather.Documentary evidence showed,\ndirectly contrary to Brashear\u2019s trial testimony, that Pinholster\u2019s\nsiblings had very troubled pasts. Pinholster\u2019s elder brother was\narrested for armed burglary, robbery, and forcible rape of a\n14-year-old with a deadly weapon. While in custody, he was\ndiagnosed as \u201ccatatonic-like\u201d and \u201cacutely psychotic, probably\nsuffering some type of schizophrenia.\u201dId., at ER\u2013219,\nER\u2013224. He later committed suicide.[Footnote 17] Pinholster\u2019s half sister, a recovering\nalcoholic, had been made a ward of the juvenile court for\nprostitution and forcible sexual battery on a\n14-year-old.Pinholster\u2019s petition and\nexhibits described a long history of emotional disturbance and\nneurological problems. A former schoolteacher stated that, as a\nchild, Pinholster \u201cseemed incapable of relating either to his peers\nor to adults,\u201d that \u201c[i]t was even hard to maintain eye contact\nwith him,\u201d and that \u201c[h]is hyperactivity was so extreme that [she]\nformed the opinion it probably had an organic base.\u201dId.,\nat ER\u2013231. School records revealed that he \u201ctalk[ed] to self\ncontinuously,\u201d had \u201cmany grimaces,\u201d fought in his sleep, and could\n\u201ccontrol self for only 1 hour per day.\u201dId., at ER\u2013230,\nER\u2013233. He \u201cshow[ed] progressive deterioration each semester since\nKindergarten.\u201dId., at ER\u2013230. School officials\nrecommended placement in a school for emotionally handicapped\nstudents and referral to a neurologist. At age nine, he had an\nabnormal EEG, revealing \u201can organic basis for his behavior.\u201dId., at ER\u2013157, ER\u2013234. Just months before the homicides,\na doctor recommended placement in the Hope Psychiatric Institute,\nbut this did not occur.This and other evidence\nattached to the petition was summarized in a declaration by Dr.\nGeorge Woods. Dr. Woods opined that Pinholster \u201csuffer[ed] from\nsevere and long standing seizure disorders,\u201did., at\nER\u2013156, that his childhood head traumas \u201cmay have been the\nprecipitating factors for [his] seizure disorder,\u201did., at\nER\u2013157, and that he suffered from bipolar mood disorder. He pointed\nto trial testimony that immediately before the burglary on the\nnight of the homicides, Pinholster announced that he \u201c\u00a0\u2018ha[d]\na message from God\u2019\u00a0\u201d\u2014which Dr. Woods believed to reflect\n\u201c[a]uditory hallucinations\u201d and \u201csevere psychosis.\u201dId.,\nat ER\u2013169. He concluded that at the time of the homicides\nPinholster \u201cwas suffering from bipolar mood disorder with psychotic\nideation and was suffering a complex partial seizure.\u201dId., at ER\u2013170. He also observed that Pinholster\u2019s\n\u201cgrossly dysfunctional family, the abuse he received as a child,\nhis history of suffering from substantial seizure and mood\ndisorders, his frequently untreated psychiatric and psychological\ndisabilities and his educational handicaps were relevant\ncircumstances which would extenuate the gravity of the crime.\u201dId., at ER\u2013171.On the basis of Pinholster\u2019s\nsubmission, the California Supreme Court denied Pinholster\u2019s\nineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim.Pinholster then filed a habeas\npetition in Federal District Court. He included an additional\nexhibit: a declaration by Dr. John Stalberg, a psychiatrist who had\nhastily examined Pinholster and produced a two-page report in the\nmiddle of the original trial.[Footnote 18] After reviewing the new material collected\nby Pinholster\u2019s habeas counsel, Dr. Stalberg stated that the\navailable evidence showed a familial history of \u201csevere psychiatric\ndisorders,\u201d \u201ca history of seizure disorders of unknown etiology,\u201d\n\u201crepeated head traumas,\u201d \u201can abnormal EEG,\u201d and \u201cevidence of mental\ndisturbance during Mr. Pinholster\u2019s childhood and some degree of\nbrain damage.\u201dId., at ER\u2013493. He also opined that \u201cthere\n[was] voluminous mitigating evidence which includes a childhood of\nphysical abuse, emotional neglect, and a family history of mental\nillness and criminal behavior.\u201dId., at ER\u2013494.The District Court stayed the\nfederal proceedings while Pinholster sought state-court review of\nclaims the District Court deemed unexhausted. Pinholster\u2019s second\nhabeas submission to the California Supreme Court included\nStalberg\u2019s declaration. That court summarily denied Pinholster\u2019s\npetition on the merits.Pinholster returned to Federal\nDistrict Court and filed an amended petition. After an evidentiary\nhearing, the District Court concluded that Pinholster had\ndemonstrated deficient performance and prejudice underStrickland.[Footnote\n19] The Ninth Circuit, sitting en banc, affirmed. 590\nF.\u00a03d 651.BAs the majority\nnotes, Pinholster\u2019s claim arises underStricklandv.Washington. \u201cThe benchmark for judging any claim of\nineffectiveness [underStrickland] must be whether\ncounsel\u2019s conduct so undermined the proper functioning of the\nadversarial process that the trial cannot be relied on as having\nproduced a just result.\u201d 466 U. S., at 686. To satisfy this\nbenchmark, a defendant must show both that \u201ccounsel\u2019s performance\nwas deficient\u201d and that \u201cthe deficient performance prejudiced the\ndefense.\u201dId., at 687.When \u00a72254(d)(1)\napplies, the question is whether \u201c\u00a0\u2018fairminded jurists could\ndisagree\u2019 on the correctness of the state court\u2019s decision.\u201dHarrington, 562 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 11) (quotingYarboroughv.Alvarado,541 U. S. 652, 664\n(2004)). When the state court rejected aStricklandclaim\non the pleadings assuming the allegations to be true, as here, seeante, at 16, n. 12, the federal court must ask whether\n\u201cthere is any reasonable argument\u201d supporting the state court\u2019s\nconclusion that the petitioner\u2019s allegations did not state a claim,Harrington, 562 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 16). This\nstandard is \u201cdifficult,\u201d but not impossible, \u201cto meet.\u201dId., at ___ (slip op., at 12). This case is one in which\nfairminded jurists could not disagree that the state court\nerred.CUnderStrickland, \u201cthe defendant must show that counsel\u2019s\nrepresentation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,\u201d\nmeasured according to \u201cprevailing professional norms.\u201d 466 U. S.,\nat 688. We \u201cindulge a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct\nfalls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u201dId., at 689. When \u00a72254(d) applies, federal-court review\nis \u201c\u00a0\u2018doubly\u2019\u00a0\u201d deferential.Harrington, 562 U.\nS., at ___ (slip op., at 16) (quotingKnowlesv.Mirzayance, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 11)).\nIn the present AEDPA posture, \u201c[t]he question is whether there is\nany reasonable argument that counsel satisfiedStrickland\u2019s deferential standard.\u201dHarrington,\n562 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 16). Here, there is\nnone.The majority\nsurmises that counsel decided on a strategy \u201cto get the\nprosecution\u2019s aggravation witnesses excluded for lack of notice,\nand if that failed, to put on Pinholster\u2019s mother.\u201dAnte,\nat 19. This is the sort of \u201c\u00a0\u2018post hocrationalization\u2019 for counsel\u2019s decisionmaking that contradicts the\navailable evidence of counsel\u2019s actions\u201d that courts cannot\nindulge.Harrington, 562 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 20)\n(quotingWigginsv.Smith,539 U. S. 510, 526\u2013527 (2003)). The\nmajority\u2019s explanation for counsel\u2019s conduct contradicts the best\navailable evidence of counsel\u2019s actions: Dettmar\u2019s frank,\ncontemporaneous statement to the trial judge that he \u201chad not\nprepared any evidence by way of mitigation.\u201d 52 Tr. 7250. The\nmajority\u2019s conjecture that counsel had in fact prepared a\nmitigation defense, based primarily on isolated entries in\ncounsel\u2019s billing records, requires it to assume that Dettmar was\nlying to the trial judge.[Footnote 20]In any event, even if\nPinholster\u2019s counsel had a strategic reason for their actions, that\nwould not automatically render their actions reasonable. For\nexample, had counsel decided their best option was to move to\nexclude the aggravating evidence, it would have been unreasonable\nto forgo a mitigation investigation on the hope that the motion\nwould be granted. With a client\u2019s life at stake, it would \u201cflou[t]\nprudence,\u201dRompillav.Beard,545 U. S. 374, 389 (2005), for an\nattorney to rely on the possibility that the court might preclude\naggravating evidence pursuant to a \u201clegal technicality\u201d without any\nbackup plan in place in case the court denied the motion,ante, at 19. No reasonable attorney would pursue such a\nrisky strategy. I do not understand the majority to suggest\notherwise.Instead, I understand the\nmajority\u2019s conclusion that counsel\u2019s actions were reasonable to\nrest on its belief that they did have a backup plan: a\nfamily-sympathy defense. In reaching this conclusion, the majority\ncommits the sameStricklanderror that we corrected,\napplying \u00a72254(d)(1), inWiggins:It holds a purportedly\n\u201ctactical judgment\u201d to be reasonable without assessing \u201cthe\nadequacy of the investigatio[n] supporting [that] judgmen[t],\u201d 539\nU. S., at 521. As we stated inStrickland:\u201c[S]trategic choices made after\nthorough investigation of law and facts relevant to plausible\noptions are virtually unchallengeable; and strategic choices made\nafter less than complete investigation are reasonable precisely to\nthe extent that reasonable professional judgments support the\nlimitations on investigation. In other words, counsel has a duty to\nmake reasonable investigations or to make a reasonable decision\nthat makes particular investigations unnecessary. In any\nineffectiveness case, a particular decision not to investigate must\nbe directly assessed for reasonableness in all the circumstances,\napplying a heavy measure of deference to counsel\u2019s judgments.\u201d 466\nU. S., at 690\u2013691.We have repeatedly applied this\nprinciple since Strickland. SeeSearsv.Upton, 561 U. S. ___, ___ (2010)(per curiam)(slip op., at 9);Porterv.McCollum, 558 U.

S., at 396.[Footnote\n21]As these cases make clear, the\nprevailing professional norms at the time of Pinholster\u2019s trial\nrequired his attorneys to \u201cconduct a thorough investigation of the\ndefendant\u2019s background,\u201dibid.(citing 1 ABA Standards for\nCriminal Justice 4\u20134.1, commentary, p.\u00a04\u201355 (2d ed. 1980)\n(hereinafter ABA Standards)), or \u201cto make a reasonable decision\nthat makes particular investigations unnecessary,\u201dStrickland, 466 U.

The\nrecords revealed that the petitioner\u2019s mother was an alcoholic,\nthat he displayed emotional difficulties in foster care, that he\nwas frequently absent from school, and that on one occasion, his\nmother left him alone for days without food.Id., at 525.\nIn these circumstances, we concluded, \u201cany reasonably competent\nattorney would have realized that pursuing these leads was\nnecessary to making an informed choice among possible defenses.\u201dIbid. Accordingly, we held, the state court\u2019s assumption\nthat counsel\u2019s investigation was adequate was an unreasonable\napplication ofStrickland. 539 U. S., at 528.[Footnote 23]This case is remarkably similar\ntoWiggins. As the majority reads the record, counsel\u2019s\nmitigation investigation consisted of talking to Pinholster\u2019s\nmother, consulting with Dr. Stalberg, and researching\nepilepsy.[Footnote 24]Ante, at 20. What little information counsel gleaned from\nthis \u201crudimentary\u201d investigation,Wiggins, 539 U. S., at\n524, would have led any reasonable attorney \u201cto investigate\nfurther,\u201did., at 527. Counsel learned from Pinholster\u2019s\nmother that he attended a class for educationally handicapped\nchildren, that a psychologist had recommended placing him in a\nmental institution, and that he spent time in a state hospital for\nemotionally handicapped children. They knew that Pinholster had\nbeen diagnosed with epilepsy.\u201c[A]ny reasonably competent\nattorney would have realized that pursuing\u201d the leads suggested by\nthis information \u201cwas necessary to making an informed choice among\npossible defenses.\u201dId., at 525; see alsoPenryv.Lynaugh,492 U. S. 302, 319\n(1989) (\u201c[E]vidence about the defendant\u2019s background and character\nis relevant because of the belief, long held by this society, that\ndefendants who commit criminal acts that are attributable to a\ndisadvantaged background, or to emotional and mental problems, may\nbe less culpable than defendants who have no such excuse\u201d (internal\nquotation marks omitted)). Yet counsel made no effort to obtain the\nreadily available evidence suggested by the information they\nlearned, such as Pinholster\u2019s schooling or medical records, or to\ncontact Pinholster\u2019s school authorities. They did not contact Dr.\nDubin or the many other health-care providers who had treated\nPinholster. Put simply, counsel \u201cfailed to act while potentially\npowerful mitigating evidence stared them in the face.\u201dBobby, 558 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 8) (citingWiggins, 539 U. S., at 525).The \u201cimpediments\u201d facing\ncounsel,ante, at 21, did not justify their minimal\ninvestigation. It is true that Pinholster was \u201can unsympathetic\nclient.\u201dIbid.But this fact compounds, rather than\nexcuses, counsel\u2019s deficiency in ignoring the glaring avenues of\ninvestigation that could explain why Pinholster was the way he was.\nSeeSears, 561 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 7) (\u201cThis\nevidence might not have made Sears any more likable to the jury,\nbut it might well have helped the jury understand Sears, and his\nhorrendous acts\u2014especially in light of his purportedly stable\nupbringing\u201d). Nor can Dr. Stalberg\u2019s two-page report, which was\nbased on a very limited record and focused primarily on\nPinholster\u2019s mental state at the time of the homicides, excuse\ncounsel\u2019s failure to investigate the broader range of potential\nmitigating circumstances.\u201cThe record of the actual\nsentencing proceedings underscores the unreasonableness of\ncounsel\u2019s conduct by suggesting that their failure to investigate\nthoroughly re-sulted from inattention, not reasoned strategic\njudgment.\u201dWiggins, 539 U. S., at 526. Dettmar told the\ntrial judge that he was unprepared to present any mitigation\nevidence. The mitigation case that counsel eventually put on can be\ndescribed, at best, as \u201chalfhearted.\u201dIbid.Counsel made\nno effort to bolster Brashear\u2019s self-interested testimony with\nschool or medical records, as the prosecutor effectively emphasized\nin closing argument. And because they did not pursue obvious leads,\nthey failed to recognize that Brashear\u2019s testimony painting\nPinholster as the bad apple in a normal, nondeprived family was\nfalse.In denying Pinholster\u2019s claim,\nthe California Supreme Court necessarily overlookedStrickland\u2019s clearly established admonition that\n\u201cstrategic choices made after less than complete investigation are\nreasonable precisely to the extent that reasonable professional\njudgments support the limitations.\u201d 466 U. S., at 690\u2013691. As inWiggins, in light of the information available to\nPinholster\u2019s counsel, it is plain that \u201creasonable professional\njudgments\u201d could not have supported their woefully inadequate\ninvestigation.[Footnote 25]\n466 U. S., at 691. Accordingly, the California Supreme Court could\nnot reasonably have concluded that Pinholster had failed to allege\nthat his counsel\u2019s investigation was inadequate underStrickland.DThe majority also\nconcludes that the California Supreme Court could reasonably have\nconcluded that Pinholster did not state a claim of prejudice. This\nconclusion, in light of the overwhelming mitigating evidence that\nwas not before the jury, is wrong. To establish prejudice, \u201c[t]he\ndefendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that,\nbut for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the\nproceeding would have been different.\u201dId., at 694. When a\nhabeas petitioner challenges a death sentence, \u201cthe question is\nwhether there is a reasonable probability that, absent the errors,\nthe sentencer \u2026 would have concluded that the balance of\naggravating and mitigating circumstances did not warrant death.\u201dId., at 695. This inquiry requires evaluating \u201cthe\ntotality of the available mitigation evidence\u2014both that adduced at\ntrial, and the evidence adduced in the habeas proceeding\u2014in\nreweighing it against the evidence in aggravation.\u201dTerry\nWilliams, 529 U. S., at 397\u2013398. The ultimate question in this\ncase is whether, taking into account all the mitigating and\naggravating evidence, \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that at\nleast one juror would have struck a different balance.\u201dWiggins, 539 U. S., at 537; see Cal. Penal Code Ann.\n\u00a7190.4(b) (West 2008) (requiring a unanimous jury verdict to impose\na death sentence).1Like the majority,\nI first consider the aggravating and mitigating evidence presented\nat trial. By virtue of its verdict in the guilt phase, the jury had\nalready concluded that Pinholster had stabbed and killed the\nvictims. As the majority states, the jury saw Pinholster \u201crevel\u201d in\nhis history of burglaries during the guilt phase.Ante, at\n26. The jury heard evidence of Pinholster\u2019s violent tendencies: He\nhad kidnapped someone with a knife, cut a person in the arm with a\nrazor, and had a history of hitting and kicking people. He\nthreatened to kill the State\u2019s lead witness. And he had an\nextensive disciplinary record in jail.Brashear offered\nbrief testimony that was apparently intended to be mitigating. Seesupra, at 19\u201320; see alsoante, at\n27\u201328.[Footnote 26] However,\nas the prosecutor argued, Brashear was not a neutral witness. See\n53 Tr. 7441 (\u201cA mother clearly loves her son, ladies and gentlemen.\nClearly not the most unbiased witness in the world\u201d).\nNotwithstanding Brashear\u2019s obvious self-interest, counsel failed to\noffer readily available, objective evidence that would have\nsubstantiated and expanded on her testimony. Their failure to do so\nallowed the prosecutor to belittle her testimony in closing\nargument. Seesupra, at 19\u201320. And Brashear\u2019s statement\nthat Pinholster would not be alive much longer because he had \u201ca\nchip in his head floating around,\u201d 52 Tr. 7397, could only have\nundermined her credibility, as the prosecutor urged, see 53id., at 7447 (\u201cDoes she want you to believe sometime\nbefore he got to country jail some doctor looked in a crystal ball\nand said, \u2018In three years you are going to die\u2019? That\u2019s\nridiculous\u201d). The trial judge was thoroughly unimpressed with\nBrashear\u2019s testimony. Seesupra, at 20.Moreover, the evidence\npresented in Pinholster\u2019s state-court petition revealed that\nBrashear distorted facts in her testimony in ways that undermined\nPinholster\u2019s mitigation case. As inSears, 561 U. S., at\n___ (slip op., at 3), the prosecutor used Brashear\u2019s testimony that\nPinholster came from a good family against him. See 53 Tr.\n7442.In sum, counsel presented\nlittle in the way of mitigating evidence, and the prosecutor\neffectively used their halfhearted attempt to present a mitigation\ncase to advocate for the death penalty. The jury nonetheless took\ntwo days to reach a decision to impose a death sentence.2The additional\nmitigating evidence presented to the California Supreme Court \u201cadds\nup to a mitigation case that bears no relation\u201d to Brashear\u2019s\nunsubstantiated testimony.Rompilla, 545 U. S., at\n393.Assuming the\nevidence presented to the California Supreme Court to be true, as\nthat court was required to do, the new mitigating evidence\npresented to that court would have shown that Pinholster was raised\nin \u201cchaos and poverty.\u201d Record ER\u2013312. The family home was filled\nwith violence. Pinholster\u2019s siblings had extremely troubled pasts.\nThere was substantial evidence of \u201cmental disturbance during Mr.\nPinholster\u2019s childhood and some degree of brain damage.\u201dId., at ER\u2013493.Dr. Woods concluded that\nPinholster\u2019s aggressive conduct resulted from bipolar mood\ndisorder. Just months before the murders, a doctor had recommended\nthat Pinholster be sent to a psychiatric institute. Dr. Woods also\nexplained that Pinholster\u2019s bizarre behavior before the murders\nreflected \u201c[a]uditory hallucinations\u201d and \u201csevere psychosis.\u201dId., at ER\u2013169. The available records confirmed that\nPinholster suffered from longstanding seizure disorders, which may\nhave been caused by his childhood head injuries.On this record, I do not see\nhow it can be said that \u201c[t]he \u2018new\u2019 evidence largely duplicated\nthe mitigation evidence at trial.\u201dAnte, at 29; seeArizonav.Fulminante,499 U. S. 279, 298\u2013299\n(1991) (evidence is not \u201cmerely cumulative\u201d if it corroborates\nother evidence that is \u201cunbelievable\u201d on its own). Brashear\u2019s\nself-interested testimony was not confirmed with objective\nevidence, as the prosecutor highlighted. The new evidence would\nhave \u201cdestroyed the [relatively] benign conception of\n[Pinholster\u2019s] upbringing\u201d presented by his mother.Rompilla, 545 U. S., at 391. The jury heard no testimony\nat all that Pinholster likely suffered from brain damage or bipolar\nmood disorder, and counsel offered no evidence to help the jury\nunderstand the likely effect of Pinholster\u2019s head injuries or his\nbizarre behavior on the night of the homicides. The jury heard no\ntestimony recounting the substantial evidence of Pinholster\u2019s\nlikely neurological problems. And it heard no medical evidence that\nPinholster suffered from epilepsy.The majority responds that\n\u201cmuch\u201d of Pinholster\u2019s new mitigating evidence \u201cis of questionable\nmitigating value.\u201dAnte, at 29. By presenting psychiatric\ntestimony, it contends, \u201cPinholster would have opened the door to\nrebuttal by a state expert.\u201dIbid.But, because the\nCalifornia Supreme Court denied Pinholster\u2019s petition on the\npleadings, it had no reason to know what a state expert might have\nsaid. Moreover, given the record evidence, it is reasonably\nprobable that at least one juror would have credited his expert. In\nany event, even if a rebuttal expert testified that Pinholster\nsuffered from antisocial personality disorder, this would hardly\nhave come as a surprise to the jury. Seeante, at 22\n(describing Pinholster as a \u201cpsychotic client whose performance at\ntrial hardly endeared him to the jury\u201d). It is for this reason that\nit was especially important for counsel to present the available\nevidence to help the jury understand Pinholster. SeeSears, 561 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 6\u20137).Had counsel conducted an\nadequate investigation, the judge and jury would have heard\ncredible evidence showing that Pinholster\u2019s criminal acts and\naggressive tendencies were \u201cattributable to a disadvantaged\nbackground, or to emotional and mental problems.\u201dPenry,\n492 U. S., at 319 (internal quotation marks omitted). They would\nhave learned that Pinholster had the \u201c\u00a0\u2018kind of troubled\nhistory we have declared relevant to assessing a defendant\u2019s moral\nculpability.\u2019\u00a0\u201dPorter, 558 U. S., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 12) (quotingWiggins, 539 U. S., at 535). ApplyingStrickland, we have repeatedly found \u201ca reasonable\nprobability,\u201d 466 U. S., at 694, that the sentencer would have\nreached a different result had counsel presented similar evidence.\nSee,e.g.,Porter, 558 U. S., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 12\u201313) (evidence of the defendant\u2019s childhood history of\nphysical abuse, brain abnormality, limited schooling, and heroic\nmilitary service);Rompilla, 545 U. S., at 392 (evidence\nof severe abuse and neglect as a child, as well as brain damage);Wiggins, 539 U. S., at 535 (evidence of the defendant\u2019s\n\u201csevere privation and abuse\u201d as a child, homelessness, and\n\u201cdiminished mental capacities\u201d);Terry Williams, 529 U.\nS., at 398 (evidence of childhood mistreatment and neglect, head\ninjuries, possible organic mental impairments, and borderline\nmental retardation).The majority does not dispute\nthe similarity between this case and the cited cases. However, it\ncriticizes the Court of Appeals for relying onRompillaandTerry Williamson the ground that we reviewed the\nprejudice questionde novoin those cases. Seeante, at 31. I do not readTerry Williamsto\nreview the prejudice questionde novo.[Footnote 27] More fundamentally, however, I\ncannot agree with the premise that \u201c[t]hose cases \u2026 offer no\nguidance with respect to whether a state court has unreasonably\ndetermined that prejudice is lacking.\u201dAnte, at 31\n(emphasis deleted). In each of these cases, we did not purport to\ncreate new law; we simply applied the same clearly established\nprecedent,Strickland, to a different set of facts.\nBecause these cases illuminate the kinds of mitigation evidence\nthat suffice to establish prejudice underStrickland, they\nprovide useful, but not dispositive, guidance for courts to\nconsider when determining whether a state court has unreasonably\nappliedStrickland.In many cases, a state court\npresented with additional mitigation evidence will reasonably\nconclude that there is no \u201creasonable probability that, but for\ncounsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would\nhave been different.\u201dStrickland, 466 U. S., at 694. This\nis not such a case. Admittedly, Pinholster unjustifiably stabbed\nand killed two people, and his history of violent outbursts and\nburglaries surely did not endear him to the jury. But the homicides\ndid not appear premeditated. And the State\u2019s aggravation case was\nno stronger than inRompillaandTerry Williams.\nSee 545 U. S., at 378, 383 (the defendant committed murder by\ntorture and had a significant history of violent felonies,\nincluding a rape); 529 U. S., at 418 (Rehnquist, C. J., concurring\nin part and dissenting in part) (the defendant had a lifetime of\ncrime, and after the murder he \u201csavagely beat an elderly woman,\u201d\nset a home on fire, and stabbed a man (internal quotation marks\nomitted)). Even on the trial record, it took the jury two days to\ndecide on a penalty. The contrast between the \u201cnot persuasive\u201d\nmitigation case put on by Pinholster\u2019s counsel, 54 Tr. 7514, and\nthe substantial mitigation evidence at their fingertips was stark.\nGiven these considerations, it is not a foregone conclusion, as the\nmajority deems it, that a juror familiar with his troubled\nbackground and psychiatric issues would have reached the same\nconclusion regarding Pinholster\u2019s culpability. Fairminded jurists\ncould not doubt that, on the record before the California Supreme\nCourt, \u201cthere [was] a reasonable probability that at least one\njuror would have struck a different balance.\u201dWiggins, 539\nU. S., at 537.IIIThe state-court\nrecord on its own was more than adequate to support the Court of\nAppeals\u2019 conclusion that the California Supreme Court could not\nreasonably have rejected Pinholster\u2019sStricklandclaim.\nThe additional evidence presented in the federal evidentiary\nhearing only confirms that conclusion.AAt the hearing,\nPinholster offered many of the same documents that were before the\nstate habeas court. He also offered his trial attorneys\u2019 billing\nrecords, which were before the state habeas court as part of the\ntrial record. Of the seven lay witnesses who testified at the\nhearing, six had previously executed declarations in support of\nPinholster\u2019s state-court petition. (The seventh, Pinholster\u2019s\nuncle, provided testimony cumulative of other\ntestimony.)Two experts\ntestified on Pinholster\u2019s behalf; neither had presented\ndeclarations to the state habeas court. The first was Dr. Donald\nOlson, assistant professor of neurology and neurological sciences\nand director of the Pediatric Epilepsy Program at Stanford\nUniversity Medical Center. It appears that Pinholster retained Dr.\nOlson to rebut the testimony of the expert disclosed by the State\nin the federal proceeding. See Decl. of Michael D. Abzug in Support\nof StipulatedEx ParteApplication to Continue Evidentiary\nHearing and Discovery Cut-Off and to Substitute Counsel inPinholsterv.Calderon, No. CV 95\u20136240\u2013GLT (CD\nCal.), p.\u00a02. Relying in part on Pinholster\u2019s abnormal EEG, Dr.\nOlson opined that Pinholster\u2019s childhood accidents \u201clikely\nresult[ed] in brain injury\u201d and that these injuries \u201cconferred a\nrisk of epilepsy.\u201d Record ER\u2013699 to ER\u2013700. He concluded that it\nwas reasonably probable that Pinholster had suffered from partial\nepilepsy since at least 1968 and had suffered from brain injury\nsince at least 1964.Id., at ER\u2013701.Pinholster\u2019s second expert was\nDr. Sophia Vinogradov, associate professor of psychiatry at the\nUniversity of California, San Francisco. Dr. Vinogradov\u2019s testimony\nwas based on essentially the same facts as Dr. Woods\u2019 and Dr.\nStalberg\u2019s state-court declarations. She highlighted Pinholster\u2019s\nchildhood head traumas, history of epilepsy, abusive and neglected\nupbringing, history of substance abuse, and bizarre behavior on the\nnight of the homicides. She opined that his aggressive behavior\nresulted from childhood head traumas:\u201cAll data indicates that there were\nsevere effects of the two serious head injuries sustained at age 2\nand age 3, with evidence for behavioral changes related to\ndysfunction of frontal cortex: severe attentional and learning\nproblems in childhood, hyperactivity, aggressivity, impulsivity,\nsocial-emotional impairment, seizure disorder, and explosive\ndyscontrol.\u201dId., at ER\u2013731.She also opined that, right before\nthe homicides, Pinholster was in an \u201capparently hallucinatory state\n[that] was likely the result of his intoxication with multiple\nsubstances.\u201dId., at ER\u2013707The State presented two\nexperts: Dr. Stalberg, the psychiatrist who had examined Pinholster\nin the middle of trial,[Footnote\n28] and Dr. David Rudnick. Although Dr. Stalberg maintained\nthat Pinholster suffered from antisocial personality disorder,\nwhich was his original diagnosis in the middle of trial, he again\nemphasized that there was \u201cvoluminous\u201d and \u201ccompelling\u201d mitigation\nevidence that had not previously been made available to him or\npresented to the jury.Id., at ER\u2013926, ER\u2013953. He stated\nthat conversations with Pinholster\u2019s family revealed that he and\nhis siblings were \u201craised like animals, wild animals,\u201did., at ER\u2013948, and he opined that Pinholster\u2019s upbringing\nwas a risk factor for antisocial personality disorder. Seeibid.(Pinholster\u2019s upbringing \u201cwould speak volumes,\nlooking at it from a mitigation point of view\u201d). And he agreed that\nthe mitigation evidence presented at trial was \u201cprofoundly\nmisleading.\u201dId., at ER\u2013966. Dr. Rudnick testified that\nPinholster suffered from antisocial personality\ndisorder.The State also introduced into\nevidence the 1978 probation report that Pinholster\u2019s counsel had in\ntheir possession at the time of his trial. The report demonstrated\nthat counsel were aware that Pinholster was in classes for\neducationally handicapped children, that he was committed to a\nstate hospital for emotionally handicapped children, and that he\nsuffered two \u201csevere head injuries.\u201dId., at\nSER\u2013243.BMuch of the\nevidence presented at the federal hearing was duplicative of the\nevidence submitted to the California Supreme Court. The additional\nevidence presented at the hearing only confirmed that the\nCalifornia Supreme Court could not reasonably have rejected\nPinholster\u2019s claim.[Footnote\n29]For example, the\nprobation report presented by the State confirmed that counsel had\nin their possession information that would have led any reasonable\nattorney \u201cto investigate further.\u201dWiggins, 539 U. S., at\n527. Counsel nevertheless took no action to investigate these\nleads.Pinholster\u2019s experts opined\nthat his childhood head traumas likely resulted in brain injury and\nconferred a risk of epilepsy. Although the State presented\ntestimony that Pinholster had antisocial personality disorder, it\nwas not clear error for the District Court to conclude that jurors\ncould have credited Pinholster\u2019s experts. Even the State\u2019s own\nexpert, Dr. Stalberg, testified to the \u201cvoluminous\u201d mitigation\nevidence in Pinholster\u2019s case. Record ER\u2013926.In sum, the evidence confirmed\nwhat was already apparent from the state-court record: Pinholster\u2019s\ncounsel failed to conduct an adequate mitigation investigation, and\nthere was a reasonable probability that at least one juror\nconfronted with the \u201cvoluminous\u201d mitigating evidence counsel should\nhave discovered would have voted to spare Pinholster\u2019s life.Ibid.Accordingly, whether on the basis of the state- or\nfederal-court record, the courts below correctly concluded that\nPinholster had shown that the California Supreme Court\u2019s decision\nreflected an unreasonable application ofStrickland.[Footnote\n30]*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*I cannot agree\nwith either aspect of the Court\u2019s ruling. I fear the consequences\nof the Court\u2019s novel interpretation of \u00a72254(d)(1) for diligent\nstate habeas petitioners with compelling evidence supporting their\nclaims who were unable, through no fault of their own, to present\nthat evidence to the state court that adjudicated their claims. And\nthe Court\u2019s conclusion that the California Supreme Court reasonably\ndenied Pinholster\u2019s ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim\noverlooks counsel\u2019s failure to investigate obvious avenues of\nmitigation and the contrast between the woefully inadequate\nmitigation case they presented and the evidence they should and\nwould have discovered. I respectfully dissent.Footnote\n1Relatedly, a state prisoner\nmust, as a general matter, properly exhaust his federal claims in\nstate court to avoid having his claim defaulted on procedural\ngrounds. SeeColemanv.Thompson,501 U.

See,e.g., Reply Brief for Petitioner 10\u201311\n(evidence withheld by the prosecutor relating to one claim may give\nrise to a separate claim underBradyv.Maryland,373 U. S. 83(1963)). The majority\nopinion does not foreclose this possibility.I assume that the majority does\nnot intend to suggest that review is limited to the state-court\nrecord when a petitioner\u2019s inability to develop the facts\nsupporting his claim was the fault of the state court itself. See\ngenerally Tr. of Oral Arg. inBellv.Kelly, O.\nT. 2008, No. 07\u20131223.Footnote\n6See,e.g.,id., at 37\u201338 (statement by counsel for the respondent\nwarden that Virginia law bars all successive habeas applications,\neven in cases where the petitioner has new evidence).Footnote\n7The majority declines,\nhowever, to provide any guidance to the lower courts on how to\ndistinguish claims adjudicated on the merits from new\nclaims.Footnote\n8Even if it can fairly be\nargued that my hypothetical petitioner has a new claim, the\nmajority fails to explain how a diligent petitioner with new\nevidence supporting an existing claim can present his new evidence\nto a federal court.Footnote\n9In this vein, it is the\nmajority\u2019s approach that \u201cwould not take seriously AEDPA\u2019s\nrequirement that federal courts defer to state-court decisions.\u201dAnte, at 10, n.\u00a03.Footnote\n10Under my reading of\n\u00a72254(d)(1), of course, the district court would review properly\nadmitted new evidence through the deferential lens of \u00a72254(d)(1),\nnotde novo.Footnote\n11The majority overlooks this\naspect ofLandrigan. It quotesLandrigan\u2019s\nobservation that \u201cif the record refutes the applicant\u2019s factual\nallegations or otherwise precludes habeas relief, a district court\nis not required to hold an evidentiary hearing,\u201d 550 U. S., at 474,\nbut that statement has no bearing on the question decided by the\nCourt today.Footnote\n12The majority claims thatMichael\nWilliamssupports its reading of \u00a72254(d)(1). With respect to\none claim asserted by the petitioner, we observed that \u201c[t]he Court\nof Appeals rejected this claim on the merits under \u00a72254(d)(1), so\nit is unnecessary to reach the question whether \u00a72254(e)(2) would\npermit a hearing on the claim.\u201d 529 U. S., at 444. That statement\nmerely reflects the fact that the Court of Appeals had rejected\nthat claim under \u00a72254(d)(1) without considering whether the\npetitioner was entitled to a hearing because the petitioner had not\nrequested a hearing on that claim. SeeWilliamsv.Taylor, 189 F.\u00a03d 421, 425, 428\u2013429 (CA4\n1999).Footnote\n13I agree with the majority that\nthe state-court record in this case consists of \u201cthe \u2018allegations\nof [the] habeas corpus petition \u2026 and \u2026 any matter of record\npertaining to the case.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAnte, at 16, n.\u00a012\n(quotingIn\u00a0re Hochberg, 2 Cal. 3d 870, 874,\nn.\u00a02, 471 P.\u00a02d 1, 3\u20134, n.\u00a02 (1970); some internal\nquotation marks omitted).The majority does not decide\nwhich of the two state-court decisions should be reviewed. Seeante, at 15, n.\u00a011. Oneamicusargues that\nPinholster must prove thatbothstate-court decisions\ninvolved an unreasonable application of law. See Brief for Criminal\nJustice Legal Foundation asAmicus Curiae26. This\nargument is based onamicus\u2019 understanding that the\nCalifornia Supreme Court rejected the second petition as successive\nand, alternatively, on the merits. The State has not argued,\nhowever, that the second ruling rests on a procedural ground. Seeante, at 6, n.\u00a02. When a state court denies two\npetitions on the merits and the difference between the petitions is\nthat the second petition contains additional evidence supporting\nthe petitioner\u2019s claim, I see no reason why the petitioner must\nindependently show that the first decision was\nunreasonable.Footnote\n14The judge instructed the jury\nto disregard this testimony upon motion by the prosecutor, but the\nprosecutor then discussed the testimony in her closing argument.\nSeeinfra, at 33\u201334.Footnote\n15By the time of Pinholster\u2019s\nstate-court habeas petition, Dettmar was deceased.Footnote\n16Counsel\u2019s billing records,\nwhich were before the California Supreme Court as part of the trial\nrecord, confirmed Brainard\u2019s recollection.Footnote\n17According to Pinholster\u2019s half\nsister, \u201cThe death of our brother Alvin was a severe emotional blow\nto me and to Scott. I believed Scott\u2019s substance abuse (heroin)\narose following and as a result of Alvin\u2019s death.\u201d Record\nER\u2013314.Footnote\n18Counsel had arranged for Dr.\nStalberg to examine Pinholster in the middle of his original trial.\nThe only documents they provided to him were police reports\nrelating to the case and a 1978 probation report. In a two-page\nreport that focused primarily on Pinholster\u2019s mental state at the\ntime of the offenses, Dr. Stalberg concluded that Pinholster had\n\u201cpsychopathic personality traits.\u201dId., at\nER\u2013187.Footnote\n19The District Court based its\ndecision on the evidence adduced at an evidentiary hearing. The\nDistrict Court did not apply 28 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a72254(d) because it\nthought, erroneously, that the California Supreme Court had not\nadjudicated Pinholster\u2019s claim on the merits. App. to Pet. for\nCert. 257. For the reasons I discuss, however, the District Court\ncould have concluded that Pinholster had satisfied \u00a72254(d)(1) on\nthe basis of the state-court record alone.Footnote\n20The majority misleadingly\ncites entries showing that counsel were preparing Brashear\u2019s\npenalty phase testimonyaftercounsel learned that the\nState intended to present aggravation evidence. The cited entries\npredating that event show only that counsel conducted about one\nday\u2019s worth of investigation\u2014consisting of talking to Brashear and\nresearching epilepsy\u2014two months before the penalty phase. See 3\nClerk\u2019s Tr. 798 (1.5-hour phone call to Brashear on Jan. 13);id., at 864, 869 (3-hour meeting with Brashear regarding\n\u201cchildhood problems\u201d on Feb. 23);id., at 869 (3.5 hours\nfor \u201c[r]esearch re; epilepsy and conf. with nurse\u201d on Feb. 25).\nThere is no evidence in the records that counsel actually planned\nto present mitigating evidence. Indeed, their complete failure to\nfollow up on any of the information they learned in their minimal\ninvestigation only confirms that they were not planning to present\nmitigating evidence. Seeinfra, at 29\u201331.Footnote\n21I do not doubt that a decision\nto present a family-sympathy mitigation defense might be consistent\n\u201cwith the standard of professional competence in capital cases that\nprevailed in Los Angeles in 1984\u201d in some cases.Ante, at\n24. My point is that even if counsel made a strategic decision to\nproceed with such a defense, that decision was unreasonable because\nit was based on an unreasonably incomplete\ninvestigation.Footnote\n22See also 1 ABA Standards\n4\u20134.1, commentary, at 4\u201355 (\u201cInformation concerning the defendant\u2019s\nbackground, education, employment record, mental and emotional\nstability, family relationships, and the like, will be relevant, as\nwill mitigating circumstances surrounding the commission of the\noffense itself\u201d). As we recognized inStrickland, the ABA\nStandards, though not dispositive, \u201care guides to determining what\nis reasonable.\u201d 466 U. S., at 688; see alsoWigginsv.Smith,539 U. S. 510, 524 (2003).Footnote\n23As the majority notes, seeante, at 24\u201325, Wiggins\u2019 trial counsel acknowledged that\nthe investigation he conducted was inconsistent with standard\npractice in Maryland. See 539 U. S., at 524. We independently\nconcluded, however, that the investigation \u201cwasalsounreasonable in light of what counsel actually discovered in the \u2026\nrecords.\u201dId., at 525 (emphasis added).Footnote\n24The majority also posits that\nBrainard likely spent time preparing Pinholster\u2019s brother Terry.\nHowever, Terry averred in a declaration that Pinholster\u2019s attorneys\n\u201cnever asked [him] any questions relating to Scott\u2019s background or\n[their] family history.\u201d Record ER\u2013313.Footnote\n25The majority chastises the\nCourt of Appeals for \u201cattributing strict rules to this Court\u2019s\nrecent case law.\u201dAnte, at 24. I agree that courts should\nnot interpret our cases to prescribe strict rules regarding the\nrequired scope of mitigation investigations. SeeRompillav.Beard,545 U. S. 374, 394 (2005) (O\u2019Connor,\nJ., concurring) (noting \u201cour longstanding case-by-case approach to\ndetermining whether an attorney\u2019s performance was\nunconstitutionally deficient underStrickland\u201d). The Ninth\nCircuit, however, did no such thing. It appropriately gave\nthoughtful consideration to the guideposts contained in these\ncases, just as we have previously done. See,e.g.,Bobbyv.Van Hook, 558 U. S. ___, ___ (2009)(per curiam)(slip op., at 8).Footnote\n26The majority mischaracterizes\nseveral aspects of Brashear\u2019s testimony. Although Brashear\ntestified that the family \u201cdidn\u2019t have lots of money,\u201d she followed\nup that comment by stating that Pinholster did not bring friends to\nthe house because \u201cit was too nice a house.\u201d 52 Tr. 7404. The\nprosecutor did not understand Brashear to have testified that\nPinholster\u2019s childhood was deprived. See 53id., at 7442\n(\u201cYou heard that he was not a deprived child\u201d). Nor did the\nCalifornia Supreme Court on direct appeal.Peoplev.Pinholster, 1 Cal. 4th 865, 910, 824 P.\u00a02d 571, 587\n(1992).Brashear did testify that\nPinholster\u2019s stepfather tried to \u201cdiscipline\u201d him and that he was\n\u201cat times\u201d \u201cabusive or near abusive.\u201d 52 Tr. 7392\u20137393. She\nsuggested, however, that Pinholster deserved the \u201cdiscipline\u201d he\nreceived. See,e.g.,id., at 7392 (\u201cScott was\nalways\u2014he had a mind of his own\u201d). It is unlikely the jury\nunderstood Brashear to be suggesting that her husband routinely\nbeat Pinholster. The prosecutor did not come away with this\nunderstanding. See 53id., at 7442.Footnote\n27Terry Williamsheld\nthat the state court\u2019s decision was \u201cunreasonable in at least two\nrespects\u201d: (1) It applied the wrong legal standard, see 529 U. S.,\nat 397, and (2) it \u201cfailed to accord appropriate weight to the body\nof mitigation evidence available to trial counsel,\u201did.,\nat 398. We did not purport to conductde novoreview.Footnote\n28Before the hearing, Dr.\nStalberg had opined that Pinholster was \u201csubstantially impaired by\na bipolar mood disorder operating synergistically with intoxication\nand a seizure disorder at the time the crime was committed.\u201d Record\nER\u2013587. At a prehearing deposition, however, Dr. Stalberg revised\nhis opinion and stated that he continued to believe that Pinholster\nsuffered from psychopathic personality traits. After the\ndeposition, Pinholster elected to proceed with a different expert,\npresumably in light of Dr. Stalberg\u2019s unexpected change in\nposition. The State then retained Dr. Stalberg as its own\nexpert.Footnote\n29The State argues that the\nDistrict Court was not entitled to rely on the evidence adduced at\nthe hearing because Pinholster was not diligent in developing his\nclaims in state court and the hearing was therefore barred by 28 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a72254(e)(2). This argument is somewhat imprecise.\nPinholster\u2019s allegations in his amended federal petition were\n\u201cidentical\u201d to the allegations he presented to the California\nSupreme Court,ante, at 6, and he diligently requested a\nhearing in state court. The State presumably means to argue that\nPinholster\u2019s new expert testimony changed \u201cthe factual basis\u201d of\nhis claim such that, by the time of the evidentiary hearing, he no\nlonger satisfied \u00a72254(e)(2). However, at oral argument, the State\nsuggested that Pinholster was presenting an altogether new claim in\nthe federal court. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 18. If that is the case,\n\u00a72254(d)(1) does not apply at all, and the State should be arguing\nlack of exhaustion or procedural default. I do not understand\nPinholster to have presented a new claim to the District\nCourt.In any event, Pinholster\nsatisfied \u00a72254(e)(2) in this case. He made \u201ca reasonable attempt,\nin light of the information available at the time, to investigate\nand pursue claims in state court.\u201dMichael Williams, 529\nU. S., at 435. His experts relied on the very same facts and\nevidence. I cannot read \u00a72254(e)(2) to impose a strict requirement\nthat petitioners must use the same experts they presented to the\nstate court. This rule would result in numerous practical problems,\nfor example in the case of the unanticipated death of an\nexpert.Footnote\n30The State\u2019s challenge in this\nCourt is limited to the questions whether the Federal District\nCourt was entitled to consider the additional evidence in the\n\u00a72254(d)(1) analysis and whether Pinholster satisfied \u00a72254(d)(1)\non the basis of the state-court record. It has not challenged the\nDistrict Court\u2019s ultimate conclusion that Pinholster had proved\nthat he was \u201cin custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or\ntreaties of the United States.\u201d \u00a72254(a).",
