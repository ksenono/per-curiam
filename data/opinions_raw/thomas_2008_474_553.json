S. ____ (2008)SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESNO. 06-1321MYRNA GOMEZ-PEREZ, PETITIONERv.JOHN E.\nPOTTER, POSTMASTER GENERALon writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the first circuit[May 27, 2008]Justice Thomas, with whom Justice\nScalia joins, dissenting.I join all but Part I of the\nChief Justice\u2019s dissent. I write separately to reiterate my view\nthatJacksonv.Birmingham Bd. of Ed.,544 U. S. 167(2005),\nincorrectly conflated the concepts of retaliation and\ndiscrimination. The text of the federal-sector provision of the Age\nDiscrimination in Employment Act of 1967 is clear: It prohibits\nonly \u201cdiscrimination based on age.\u201d 29 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7633a(a) (2000\ned., Supp. V). If retaliation is not \u201cdiscrimination on the basis\nof sex,\u201dJackson,supra,at 185 (Thomas, J.,\ndissenting), or \u201cdiscrimination based on race,\u201dCBOCS West,\nInc.v.Humphries,ante,at 4 (Thomas, J.,\ndissenting), it is certainly not \u201cdiscrimination based on age.\u201d\nBecause \u00a7633a(a) provides no basis for implying a private right of\naction for retaliation claims, and its context only reaffirms its\nplain meaning, seeante,at 5\u20139 (opinion of Roberts,\nC.\u00a0J.), I would affirm the judgment below.",
