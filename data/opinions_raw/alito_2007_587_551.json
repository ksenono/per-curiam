HEIN, DIRECTOR, WHITE HOUSE OFFICE OF\nFAITH-BASED AND COMMUNITY INITIATIVES, et\u00a0al., PETITIONERSv.FREEDOM FROM RELI- GION FOUNDATION, INC.,\net\u00a0al.on writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the seventh circuit[June 25, 2007]Justice Alito announced the\njudgment of the Court and delivered an opinion in which The Chief\nJustice and Justice Kennedy join.This is a lawsuit in which it was\nclaimed that conferences held as part of the President\u2019s\nFaith-Based and Community Initiatives program violated the\nEstablishment Clause of the First Amendment because, among other\nthings, President Bush and former Secretary of Education Paige gave\nspeeches that used \u201creligious imagery\u201d and praised the efficacy of\nfaith-based programs in delivering social services. The plaintiffs\ncontend that they meet the standing requirements of Article III of\nthe Constitution because they pay federal taxes.It has long been established, however, that\nthe payment of taxes is generally not enough to establish standing\nto challenge an action taken by the Federal Government. In light of\nthe size of the federal budget, it is a complete fiction to argue\nthat an unconstitutional federal expenditure causes an individual\nfederal taxpayer any measurable economic harm. And if every federal\ntaxpayer could sue to challenge any Government expenditure, the\nfederal courts would cease to function as courts of law and would\nbe cast in the role of general complaint bureaus.InFlastv.Cohen,392 U.\nS. 83(1968), we recognized a narrow exception to the general\nrule against federal taxpayer standing. UnderFlast, a\nplaintiff asserting an Establishment Clause claim has standing to\nchallenge a law authorizing the use of federal funds in a way that\nallegedly violates the Establishment Clause. In the present case,\nCongress did not specifically authorize the use of federal funds to\npay for the conferences or speeches that the plaintiffs challenged.\nInstead, the conferences and speeches were paid for out of general\nExecutive Branch appropriations. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court of\nAppeals, however, held that the plaintiffs have standing as\ntaxpayers because the conferences were paid for with money\nappropriated by Congress.The question that is presented here is whether\nthis broad reading ofFlastis correct. We hold that it is\nnot. We therefore reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals.IAIn 2001, the President issued an\nexecutive order creating the White House Office of Faith-Based and\nCommunity Initiatives within the Executive Office of the President.\nExec. Order No. 13199, 3 CFR 752 (2001 Comp.). The purpose of this\nnew office was to ensure that \u201cprivate and charitable community\ngroups, including religious ones \u2026 have the fullest opportunity\npermitted by law to compete on a level playing field, so long as\nthey achieve valid public purposes\u201d and adhere to \u201cthe bedrock\nprinciples of pluralism, nondiscrimination, evenhandedness, and\nneutrality.\u201dIbid. The office was specifically charged\nwith the task of eliminating unnecessary bureaucratic, legislative,\nand regulatory barriers that could impede such organizations\u2019\neffectiveness and ability to compete equally for federal\nassistance.Id., at 752\u2013753.By separate executive orders, the\nPresident also created Executive Department Centers for Faith-Based\nand Community Initiatives within several federal agencies and\ndepartments.[Footnote 1] These\ncenters were given the job of ensuring that faith-based community\ngroups would be eligible to compete for federal financial support\nwithout impairing their independence or autonomy, as long as they\ndid \u201cnot use direct Federal financial assistance to support any\ninherently religious activities, such as worship, religious\ninstruction, or proselytization.\u201d Exec. Order No. 13279, 3 CFR\n\u00a72(f), p.\u00a0260 (2002 Comp.). To this end, the President\ndirected that \u201c[n]o organization should be discriminated against on\nthe basis of religion or religious belief in the administration or\ndistribution of Federal financial assistance under social service\nprograms,\u201did., \u00a72(c), at 260, and that \u201c[a]ll\norganizations that receive Federal financial assistance under\nsocial services programs should be prohibited from discriminating\nagainst beneficiaries or potential beneficiaries of the social\nservices programs on the basis of religion or religious belief,\u201did., \u00a72(d), at 260. Petitioners, who have been sued in\ntheir official capacities, are the directors of the White House\nOffice and various Executive Department Centers.No congressional legislation specifically\nauthorized the creation of the White House Office or the Executive\nDepartment Centers. Rather, they were \u201ccreated entirely within the\nexecutive branch \u2026 by Presidential executive order.\u201dFreedom\nFrom Religion Foundation, Inc.v.Chao, 433\nF.\u00a03d 989, 997 (CA7 2006). Nor has Congress enacted any law\nspecifically appropriating money for these entities\u2019 activities.\nInstead, their activities are funded through general Executive\nBranch appropriations. For example, the Department of Education\u2019s\nCenter is funded from money appropriated for the Office of the\nSecretary of Education, while the Department of Housing and Urban\nDevelopment\u2019s Center is funded through that Department\u2019s salaries\nand expenses account. See Government Accountability Office,\nFaith-Based and Community Initiative: Improvements in Monitoring\nGrantees and Measuring Performance Could Enhance Accountability,\nGAO\u201306\u2013616, p.\u00a021 (June 2006), online at\nhttp://www.gao.gov/new.items/d06616.pdf (as visited June 25, 2007,\nand available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file); see also Amended\nComplaint in No. 04\u2013C\u2013381\u2013S (WD Wis.), \u00b623, App. to Pet. for Cert.\n71a\u201372a.BThe respondents are Freedom From\nReligion Foundation, Inc., a nonstock corporation \u201copposed to\ngovernment endorsement of religion,\u201did., \u00b65, App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 68a, and three of its members. Respondents brought suit\nin the United\u00a0States District Court for the Western District\nof Wisconsin, alleging that petitioners violated the Establishment\nClause by organizing conferences at which faith-based organizations\nallegedly \u201care singled out as being particularly worthy of federal\nfunding \u2026 , and the belief in God is extolled as distinguishing the\nclaimed effectiveness of faith-based social services.\u201dId., \u00b632, App. to Pet. for Cert. 73a. Respondents further\nalleged that the content of these conferences sent a message to\nreligious believers \u201cthat they are insiders and favored members of\nthe political community\u201d and that the conferences sent the message\nto nonbelievers \u201cthat they are outsiders\u201d and \u201cnot full members of\nthe political community.\u201dId., \u00b637, App. to Pet. for Cert.\n76a. In short, respondents alleged that the conferences were\ndesigned to promote, and had the effect of promoting, religious\ncommunity groups over secular ones.The only asserted basis for\nstanding was that the individual respondents are federal taxpayers\nwho are \u201copposed to the use of Congressional taxpayer\nappropriations to advance and promote religion.\u201dId., \u00b610,\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 69a; see alsoid., \u00b6\u00b67\u20139, App. to\nPet. for Cert. 68a\u201369a. In their capacity as federal taxpayers,\nrespondents sought to challenge Executive Branch expenditures for\nthese conferences, which, they contended, violated the\nEstablishment Clause.CThe District Court dismissed the\nclaims against petitioners for lack of standing. SeeFreedom\nFrom Religion Foundation, Inc.v.Towey, No.\n04\u2013C\u2013381\u2013S (WD Wis., Nov. 15, 2004), App. to Pet. for Cert.\n27a\u201335a. It concluded that underFlast,392 U.\nS. 83, federal taxpayer standing is limited to Establishment\nClause challenges to the constitutionality of \u201c\u00a0\u2018exercises of\ncongressional power under the taxing and spending clause of\nArt.\u00a0I, \u00a78.\u2019\u00a0\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 31a (quotingFlast,supra, at 102). Because petitioners in\nthis case acted \u201cat the President\u2019s request and on the President\u2019s\nbehalf\u201d and were not \u201ccharged with the administration of a\ncongressional program,\u201d the District Court concluded that the\nchallenged activities were \u201cnot \u2018exercises of congressional\npower\u2019\u00a0\u201d sufficient to provide a basis for taxpayer standing\nunderFlast. App. to Pet. for Cert. 33a\u201334a.A divided panel of the United\nStates Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed. 433\nF.\u00a03d 989. The majority readFlastas granting\nfederal taxpayers standing to challenge Executive Branch programs\non Establishment Clause grounds so long as the activities are\n\u201cfinanced by a congressional appropriation.\u201d 433 F.\u00a03d, at\n997. This was the case, the majority concluded, even where \u201cthere\nis no statutory program\u201d enacted by Congress and the funds are\n\u201cfrom appropriations for the general administrative expenses, over\nwhich the President and other executive branch officials have a\ndegree of discretionary power.\u201dId., at 994. According to\nthe majority, a taxpayer has standing to challenge anything done by\na federal agency or officer so long as \u201cthe marginal or incremental\ncost to the taxpaying public of the alleged violation of the\nestablishment clause\u201d is greater than \u201czero.\u201dId., at\n995.In dissent, Judge Ripple opined that the\nmajority\u2019s decision reflected a \u201cdramatic expansion of current\nstanding doctrine,\u201did., at 997, that \u201ccuts the concept of\ntaxpayer standing loose from its moorings,\u201did., at 998.\nNoting that \u201c[t]he executive can do nothing without general budget\nappropriations from Congress,\u201did., at 1000, he criticized\nthe majority for oversteppingFlast\u2019s requirement that a\n\u201cplaintiff must bring an attack against a disbursement of public\nfunds made in the exercise ofCongress\u2019taxing and\nspending power,\u201d 433 F.\u00a03d, at 1000 (emphasis in\noriginal).The Court of Appeals denied en banc review by\na vote of seven to four. 447 F.\u00a03d 988 (CA7 2006). Concurring\nin the denial of rehearing, Chief Judge Flaum expressed doubt about\nthe panel decision, but noted that \u201cthe obvious tension which has\nevolved in this area of jurisprudence \u2026 can only be resolved by the\nSupreme Court.\u201dIbid.We granted certiorari to resolve\nthis question, 549 U. S. ___ (2006), and we now reverse.IIAArticle III of the Constitution\nlimits the judicial power of the United States to the resolution of\n\u201cCases\u201d and \u201cControversies,\u201d and \u201c\u00a0\u2018Article III standing \u2026\nenforces the Constitution\u2019s case-or-controversy\nrequirement.\u2019\u00a0\u201dDaimlerChrysler Corp.v.Cuno, 547 U. S. ___, ___ (2006) (slip op., at 6) (quotingElk Grove Unified School Dist.v.Newdow,542 U. S. 1, 11\n(2004)). \u201c\u00a0\u2018No principle is more fundamental to the\njudiciary\u2019s proper role in our system of government than the\nconstitutional limitation of federal-court jurisdiction to actual\ncases or controversies.\u2019\u00a0\u201dRainesv.Byrd,521 U. S. 811,\n818 (1997) (quotingSimonv.Eastern Ky. Welfare\nRights Organization,426 U. S. 26, 37\n(1976)).\u201c[O]ne of the controlling\nelements in the definition of a case or controversy under Article\nIII\u201d is standing.ASARCO Inc.v.Kadish,490 U. S. 605, 613 (1989) (opinion of\nKennedy, J.). The requisite elements of Article III standing are\nwell established: \u201cA plaintiff must allege personal injury fairly\ntraceable to the defendant\u2019s allegedly unlawful conduct and likely\nto be redressed by the requested relief.\u201dAllenv.Wright,468\nU. S. 737, 751 (1984).The constitutionally mandated standing inquiry\nis especially important in a case like this one, in which taxpayers\nseek \u201cto challenge laws of general application where their own\ninjury is not distinct from that suffered in general by other\ntaxpayers or citizens.\u201dASARCO,supra, at 613\n(opinion of Kennedy, J.).This is because \u201c[t]he judicial\npower of the United States defined by Art.\u00a0III is not an\nunconditioned authority to determine the constitutionality of\nlegislative or executive acts.\u201dValley Forge Christian\nCollegev.Americans United for Separation of Church and\nState, Inc.,454 U. S. 464, 471 (1982). The federal\ncourts are not empowered to seek out and strike down any\ngovernmental act that they deem to be repugnant to the\nConstitution. Rather, federal courts sit \u201csolely, to decide on the\nrights of individuals,\u201dMarburyv.Madison, 1\nCranch 137, 170 (1803), and must \u201c\u00a0\u2018refrai[n] from passing\nupon the constitutionality of an act \u2026 unless obliged to do so in\nthe proper performance of our judicial function, when the question\nis raised by a party whose interests entitle him to raise\nit.\u2019\u00a0\u201dValley Forge,supra, at 474 (quotingBlairv.United States,250 U. S. 273, 279\n(1919)). As we held over 80 years ago, in another case involving\nthe question of taxpayer standing:\u201cWe have no powerper seto review and\nannul acts of Congress on the ground that they are\nunconstitutional. The question may be considered only when the\njustification for some direct injury suffered or threatened,\npresenting a justiciable issue, is made to rest upon such an\nact\u2026\u00a0. The party who invokes the power must be able to show\nnot only that the statute is invalid but that he has sustained or\nis immediately in danger of sustaining some direct injury as the\nresult of its enforcement, and not merely that he suffers in some\nindefinite way in common with people generally.\u201dFrothinghamv.Mellon, decided withMassachusettsv.Mellon,262 U. S. 447, 488 (1923).BAs a general matter, the interest\nof a federal taxpayer in seeing that Treasury funds are spent in\naccordance with the Constitution does not give rise to the kind of\nredressable \u201cpersonal injury\u201d required for Article III standing. Of\ncourse, a taxpayer has standing to challenge thecollectionof a specific tax assessment as\nunconstitutional; being forced to pay such a tax causes a real and\nimmediate economic injury to the individual taxpayer. See,e.g.,Follettv.Town of McCormick,321 U. S. 573(1944) (invalidating tax on preaching on First Amendment grounds).\nBut that is not the interest on which respondents assert standing\nhere. Rather, their claim is that, having paid lawfully collected\ntaxes into the Federal Treasury at some point, they have a\ncontinuing, legally cognizable interest in ensuring that those\nfunds are notusedby the Government in a way that\nviolates the Constitution.We have consistently held that\nthis type of interest is too generalized and attenuated to support\nArticle III standing. InFrothingham, a federal taxpayer\nsought to challenge federal appropriations for mothers\u2019 and\nchildren\u2019s health, arguing that federal involvement in this area\nintruded on the rights reserved to the States under the Tenth\nAmendment and would \u201cincrease the burden of future taxation and\nthereby take [the plaintiff\u2019s] property without due process of\nlaw.\u201d 262 U. S., at 486. We concluded that the plaintiff lacked the\nkind of particularized injury required for Article\u00a0III\nstanding:\u201c[I]nterest in the moneys of the Treasury \u2026 is\nshared with millions of others; is comparatively minute and\nindeterminable; and the effect upon future taxation, of any payment\nout of the funds, so remote, fluctuating and uncertain, that no\nbasis is afforded for an appeal to the preventive powers of a court\nof equity.\u201cThe administration of any statute, likely to\nproduce additional taxation to be imposed upon a vast number of\ntaxpayers, the extent of whose several liability is indefinite and\nconstantly changing, is essentially a matter of public and not of\nindividual concern.\u201dId., at 487.Because the interests of the\ntaxpayer are, in essence, the interests of the public-at-large,\ndeciding a constitutional claim based solely on taxpayer standing\n\u201cwould be[,] not to decide a judicial controversy, but to assume a\nposition of authority over the governmental acts of another and\nco-equal department, an authority which plainly we do not possess.\u201dId., at 489; see alsoAlabama Power Co.v.Ickes,302\nU. S. 464, 478\u2013479 (1938).InDoremusv.Board of Ed. of\nHawthorne,342\nU. S. 429, 433 (1952), we reaffirmed this principle, explaining\nthat \u201cthe interests of a taxpayer in the moneys of the federal\ntreasury are too indeterminable, remote, uncertain and indirect to\nfurnish a basis for an appeal to the preventive powers of the Court\nover their manner of expenditure.\u201d We therefore rejected a state\ntaxpayer\u2019s claim of standing to challenge a state law authorizing\npublic school teachers to read from the Bible because \u201cthe\ngrievance which [the plaintiff] sought to litigate \u2026 is not a\ndirect dollars-and-cents injury but is a religious difference.\u201dId., at 434. In so doing, we gave effect to the basic\nconstitutional principle that\u201ca plaintiff raising only a generally available\ngrievance about government\u2014claiming only harm to his and every\ncitizen\u2019s interest in proper application of the Constitution and\nlaws, and seeking relief that no more directly and tangibly\nbenefits him than it does the public at large\u2014does not state an\nArticle III case or controversy.\u201dLujanv.Defenders\nof Wildlife,504 U. S. 555, 573\u2013574\n(1992).[Footnote 2]CInFlast, the Court\ncarved out a narrow exception to the general constitutional\nprohibition against taxpayer standing. The taxpayer-plaintiff in\nthat case challenged the distribution of federal funds to religious\nschools under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965,\nalleging that such aid violated the Establishment Clause. The Court\nset out a two-part test for determining whether a federal taxpayer\nhas standing to challenge an allegedly unconstitutional\nexpenditure:\u201cFirst, the taxpayer must establish a logical link\nbetween that status and the type of legislative enactment attacked.\nThus, a taxpayer will be a proper party to allege the\nunconstitutionality only of exercises of congressional power under\nthe taxing and spending clause of Art.\u00a0I, \u00a78, of the\nConstitution. It will not be sufficient to allege an incidental\nexpenditure of tax funds in the administration of an essentially\nregulatory statute\u2026\u00a0. Secondly, the taxpayer must establish a\nnexus between that status and the precise nature of the\nconstitutional infringement alleged. Under this requirement, the\ntaxpayer must show that the challenged enactment exceeds specific\nconstitutional limitations imposed upon the exercise of the\ncongressional taxing and spending power and not simply that the\nenactment is generally beyond the powers delegated to Congress by\nArt.\u00a0I, \u00a78.\u201dFlast, 392 U. S., at 102\u2013103.The Court held that the\ntaxpayer-plaintiff inFlasthad satisfied both prongs of\nthis test: The plaintiff\u2019s \u201cconstitutional challenge [was] made to\nan exercise by Congress of its power under Art.\u00a0I, \u00a78, to\nspend for the general welfare,\u201d and she alleged a violation of the\nEstablishment Clause, which \u201coperates as a specific constitutional\nlimitation upon the exercise by Congress of the taxing and spending\npower conferred by Art.\u00a0I, \u00a78.\u201dId., at 103\u2013104.IIIARespondents argue that this case\nfalls within theFlastexception, which they read to cover\nany \u201cexpenditure of government funds in violation of the\nEstablishment Clause.\u201d Brief for Respondents 12. But this broad\nreading fails to observe \u201cthe rigor with which theFlastexception to theFrothinghamprinciple ought to be\napplied.\u201dValley Forge, 454 U. S., at 481.The expenditures at issue inFlastwere made pursuant to an express congressional\nmandate and a specific congressional appropriation. The plaintiff\nin that case challenged disbursements made under the Elementary and\nSecondary Education Act of 1965, 79 Stat. 27. That Act expressly\nappropriated the sum of $100 million for fiscal year 1966, \u00a7201(b),id., at 36, and authorized the disbursement of those funds\nto local educational agencies for the education of low-income\nstudents, seeFlast,supra, at 86. The Act\nmandated that local educational agencies receiving such funds\n\u201cma[k]e provision for including special educational services and\narrangements (such as dual enrollment, educational radio and\ntelevision, and mobile educational services and equipment)\u201d in\nwhich students enrolled in private elementary and secondary schools\ncould participate, \u00a72, 79 Stat. 30\u201331. In addition, recipient\nagencies were required to ensure that \u201clibrary resources,\ntextbooks, and other instructional materials\u201d funded through the\ngrants \u201cbe provided on an equitable basis for the use of children\nand teachers in private elementary and secondary schools,\u201d\n\u00a7203(a)(3)(B),id., at 37.The expenditures challenged inFlast,\nthen, were funded by a specific congressional appropriation and\nwere disbursed to private schools (including religiously affiliated\nschools) pursuant to a direct and unambiguous congressional\nmandate.[Footnote 3] Indeed,\ntheFlasttaxpayer-plaintiff\u2019s constitutional claim was\npremised on the contention that if the Government\u2019s actions were\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018within the authority and intent of the Act, the Act is to\nthat extent unconstitutional and void.\u2019\u00a0\u201dFlast, 392\nU. S., at 90. And the judgment reviewed by this Court inFlastsolely concerned the question whether \u201cif [the\nchallenged] expenditures are authorized by the Act the statute\nconstitutes a \u2018law respecting an establishment of religion\u2019 and law\n\u2018prohibiting the free exercise thereof\u2019\u00a0\u201d under the First\nAmendment.Flastv.Gardner, 271 F.\u00a0Supp. 1,\n2 (SDNY 1967).Given that the alleged Establishment Clause\nviolation inFlastwas funded by a specific congressional\nappropriation and was undertaken pursuant to an express\ncongressional mandate, the Court concluded that the\ntaxpayer-plaintiffs had established the requisite \u201clogical link\nbetween [their taxpayer] status and the type of legislative\nenactment attacked.\u201d In the Court\u2019s words, \u201c[t]heir constitutional\nchallenge [was] made to an exercise by Congress of its power under\nArt.\u00a0I, \u00a78, to spend for the general welfare.\u201d 392 U. S., at\n90. But as this Court later noted,Flast\u201c limited\ntaxpayer standing to challenges directed \u2018only [at] exercises of\ncongressional power\u2019\u00a0\u201d under the Taxing and Spending Clause.Valley Forge, 454 U. S., at 479.BThe link between congressional\naction and constitutional violation that supported taxpayer\nstanding inFlastis missing here. Respondents do not\nchallenge any specific congressional action or appropriation; nor\ndo they ask the Court to invalidate any congressional enactment or\nlegislatively created program as unconstitutional. That is because\nthe expenditures at issue here were not made pursuant to any Act of\nCongress. Rather, Congress provided general appropriations to the\nExecutive Branch to fund its day-to-day activities.[Footnote 4] These appropriations did not\nexpressly authorize, direct, or even mention the expenditures of\nwhich respondents complain. Those expenditures resulted from\nexecutive discretion, not congressional action.We have never found taxpayer\nstanding under such circumstances. InValley Forge, we\nheld that a taxpayer lacked standing to challenge \u201ca decision by\n[the federal Department of Health, Education and Welfare] to\ntransfer a parcel of federal property\u201d to a religious college\nbecause this transfer was \u201cnot a congressional action.\u201d 454 U. S.,\nat 479. In fact, the connection to congressional action was closer\ninValley Forgethan it is here, because in that case, the\n\u201cparticular Executive Branch action\u201d being challenged was at least\n\u201carguably authorized\u201d by the Federal Property and Administrative\nServices Act of 1949, which permitted federal agencies to transfer\nsurplus property to private entities.Id., at 479,\nn.\u00a015. Nevertheless, we found that the plaintiffs lacked\nstanding becauseFlast\u201climited taxpayer standing to\nchallenges directed \u2018only [at] exercises of congressional\npower\u2019\u00a0\u201d under the Taxing and Spending Clause. 454 U. S., at\n479 (quotingFlast,supra, at 102).[Footnote 5]Similarly, inSchlesingerv.Reservists Comm. to Stop the War,418 U. S. 208(1974), the\ntaxpayer-plaintiffs contended that the Incompatibility Clause of\nArticle I prohibited Members of Congress from holding commissions\nin the Armed Forces Reserve. We held that these plaintiffs lacked\nstanding underFlastbecause they \u201cdid not challenge an\nenactment under Art.\u00a0I, \u00a78, but rather the action of the\nExecutive Branch in permitting Members of Congress to maintain\ntheir Reserve status.\u201d 418 U. S., at 228. This was the case even\nthough the plaintiffs sought to reclaim reservist pay received by\nthose Members\u2014pay that presumably was funded through Congress\u2019\ngeneral appropriations for the support of the Armed Forces: \u201cSuch\nrelief would follow from the invalidity of Executive action in\npaying persons who could not lawfully have been reservists, not\nfrom the invalidity of the statutes authorizing pay to those who\nlawfully were Reservists.\u201dIbid., n.\u00a017. See alsoUnited Statesv.Richardson,418 U. S. 166, 175 (1974) (denying\ntaxpayers standing to compel publication of accounting for the\nCentral Intelligence Agency because \u201cthere is no \u2018logical nexus\u2019\nbetween the asserted status of taxpayer and the claimed failure of\nthe Congress to require the Executive to supply a more detailed\nreport of the expenditures of that agency\u201d).Bowenv.Kendrick,487 U. S. 589(1988), on\nwhich respondents rely heavily, is not to the contrary. In that\ncase, we held that the taxpayer-plaintiffs had standing to mount an\nas-applied challenge to the Adolescent Family Life Act (AFLA),\nwhich authorized federal grants to private community service groups\nincluding religious organizations. The Court found \u201ca sufficient\nnexus between the taxpayer\u2019s standing as a taxpayer and the\ncongressional exercise of taxing and spending power,\u201d\nnotwithstanding the fact that the \u201cthe funding authorized by\nCongress ha[d] flowed through and been administered\u201d by an\nExecutive Branch official.Id., at 620, 619.But the key to that conclusion was the Court\u2019s\nrecognition that AFLA was \u201cat heart a program of disbursement of\nfunds pursuant to Congress\u2019 taxing and spending powers,\u201d and that\nthe plaintiffs\u2019 claims \u201ccall[ed] into question how the funds\nauthorized by Congress [were] being disbursedpursuant to the\nAFLA\u2019s statutory mandate.\u201dId., at 619\u2013620 (emphasis\nadded). AFLA not only expressly authorized and appropriated\nspecific funds for grant-making, it also expressly contemplated\nthat some of those moneys might go to projects involving religious\ngroups. Seeid., at 595\u2013596; see alsoid., at 623\n(O\u2019Connor, J., concurring) (noting the \u201cpartnership between\ngovernmental and religious institutions contemplated by the\nAFLA\u201d).[Footnote 6] Unlike this\ncase,Kendrickinvolved a \u201cprogram of disbursement of\nfunds pursuant to Congress\u2019 taxing and spending powers\u201d that\n\u201cCongress had created,\u201d \u201cauthorized,\u201d and \u201cmandate[d].\u201dId., at 619\u2013620.Respondents attempt to paint their lawsuit as\naKendrick-style as-applied challenge, but this effort is\nunavailing for the simple reason that they can cite no statute\nwhose application they challenge. The best they can do is to point\nto unspecified, lump-sum \u201cCongressional budget appropriations\u201d for\nthe general use of the Executive Branch\u2014the allocation of which \u201cis\na[n] administrative decision traditionally regarded as committed to\nagency discretion.\u201dLincolnv.Vigil,508 U. S. 182, 192\n(1993). Characterizing this case as an \u201cas-applied challenge\u201d to\nthese general appropriations statutes would stretch the meaning of\nthat term past its breaking point. It cannot be that every legal\nchallenge to a discretionary Executive Branch action implicates the\nconstitutionality of the underlying congressional appropriation.\nWhen a criminal defendant charges that a federal agent carried out\nan unreasonable search or seizure, we do not view that claim as an\nas-applied challenge to the constitutionality of the statute\nappropriating funds for the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\nRespondents have not established why the discretionary Executive\nBranch expenditures here, which are similarly funded by no-strings,\nlump-sum appropriations, should be viewed any differently.[Footnote 7]In short, this case falls outside the \u201cthe\nnarrow exception\u201d thatFlast\u201ccreated to the general rule\nagainst taxpayer standing established inFrothingham.\u201dKendrick,supra, at 618. Because the expenditures\nthat respondents challenge were not expressly authorized or\nmandated by any specific congressional enactment, respondents\u2019\nlawsuit is not directed at an exercise of congressional power, seeValley Forge, 454 U. S., at 479, and thus lacks the\nrequisite \u201clogical nexus\u201d between taxpayer status \u201cand the type of\nlegislative enactment attacked.\u201dFlast, 392 U. S., at\n102.IVA1Respondents argue that it is\n\u201carbitrary\u201d to distinguish between money spent pursuant to\ncongressional mandate and expenditures made in the course of\nexecutive discretion, because \u201cthe injury to taxpayers in both\nsituations is the very injury targeted by the Establishment Clause\nandFlast\u2014the expenditure for the support of religion of\nfunds exacted from taxpayers.\u201d Brief for Respondents 13. The panel\nmajority below agreed, based on its observation that \u201cthere is so\nmuch that executive officials could do to promote religion in ways\nforbidden by the establishment clause.\u201d 433 F.\u00a03d, at 995.ButFlastfocused on\ncongressional action, and we must decline this invitation to extend\nits holding to encompass discretionary Executive Branch\nexpenditures.Flastitself distinguished the \u201cincidental\nexpenditure of tax funds in the administration of an essentially\nregulatory statute,\u201dFlast,supra, at 102, and we\nhave subsequently rejected the view that taxpayer standing \u201cextends\nto \u2018the Government as a whole, regardless of which branch is at\nwork in a particular instance,\u2019\u00a0\u201dValley Forge,supra, at 484, n.\u00a020. Moreover, we have repeatedly\nemphasized that theFlastexception has a \u201cnarrow\napplication in our precedent,\u201dCuno, 547 U. S., at ___\n(slip op., at 12), that only \u201cslightly lowered\u201d the bar on taxpayer\nstanding,Richardson, 418 U. S., at 173, and that must be\napplied with \u201crigor,\u201dValley Forge,supra, at\n481.It is significant that, in the four decades\nsince its creation, theFlastexception has largely been\nconfined to its facts. We have declined to lower the taxpayer\nstanding bar in suits alleging violations of any constitutional\nprovision apart from the Establishment Clause. SeeTiltonv.Richardson,403 U. S. 672(1971) (no\ntaxpayer standing to sue under Free Exercise Clause of First\nAmendment);Richardson, 418 U. S., at 175 (no taxpayer\nstanding to sue under Statement and Account Clause of Art. I);Schlesinger, 418 U. S., at 228 (no taxpayer standing to\nsue under Incompatibility Clause of Art.\u00a0I);Cuno,supra,at ___ (slip op., at 13) (no taxpayer standing to\nsue under Commerce Clause). We have similarly refused to extendFlastto permit taxpayer standing for Establishment Clause\nchallenges that do not implicate Congress\u2019 taxing and spending\npower. SeeValley Forge,supra, at 479\u2013482 (no\ntaxpayer standing to challenge Executive Branch action taken\npursuant to Property Clause of Art.\u00a0IV); see alsoDistrict\nof Columbia Common Causev.District of Columbia, 858\nF.\u00a02d 1, 3\u20134 (CADC 1988);In\u00a0re United States\nCatholic Conference, 885 F.\u00a02d 1020, 1028 (CA2 1989). In\neffect, we have adopted the position set forth by Justice Powell in\nhis concurrence inRichardsonand have \u201climit[ed] the\nexpansion of federal taxpayer and citizen standing in the absence\nof specific statutory authorization to an outer boundary drawn by\ntheresultsinFlast\u2026\u00a0.\u201d 418 U. S., at\n196.2While respondents argue that\nExecutive Branch expenditures in support of religion are no\ndifferent from legislative extractions,Flastitself\nrejected this equivalence: \u201cIt will not be sufficient to allege an\nincidental expenditure of tax funds in the administration of an\nessentially regulatory statute.\u201d 392 U. S., at 102.Because almost all Executive\nBranch activity is ultimately funded by some congressional\nappropriation, extending theFlastexception to purely\nexecutive expenditures would effectively subject every federal\naction\u2014be it a conference, proclamation or speech\u2014to Establishment\nClause challenge by any taxpayer in federal court. To see the wide\nswathe of activity that respondents\u2019 proposed rule would cover, one\nneed look no further than the amended complaint in this action,\nwhich focuses largely on speeches and presentations made by\nExecutive Branch officials. See,e.g., Amended Complaint\n\u00b632, App. to Pet. for Cert. 73a (challenging Executive Branch\nofficials\u2019 \u201csupport of national and regional conferences\u201d);id., \u00b633, App. to Pet. for Cert. 73a\u201375a (challenging\ncontent of speech by Secretary of Education);id., \u00b6\u00b635,\n36, App. to Pet. for Cert. 76a (challenging content of Presidential\nspeeches);id., \u00b641, App. to Pet. for Cert. 77a\n(challenging Executive Branch officials\u2019 \u201cpublic appearances\u201d and\n\u201cspeeches\u201d). Such a broad reading would ignore the first prong ofFlast\u2019s standing test, which requires \u201ca logical link\nbetween [taxpayer] status and the type of legislative enactment\nattacked.\u201d 392 U. S., at 102.It would also raise serious\nseparation-of-powers concerns. As we have recognized,Flastitself gave too little weight to these concerns. By\nframing the standing question solely in terms of whether the\ndispute would be presented in an adversary context and in a form\ntraditionally viewed as capable of judicial resolution,Flast\u201cfailed to recognize that this doctrine has a\nseparation-of-powers component, which keeps courts within certain\ntraditional bounds vis-\u00c0-vis the other branches, concrete\nadverseness or not.\u201dLewisv.Casey,518 U. S. 343, 353,\nn.\u00a03 (1996); see alsoValley Forge, 454 U. S., at\n471. Respondents\u2019 position, if adopted, would repeat and compound\nthis mistake.The constitutional requirements for\nfederal-court jurisdiction\u2014including the standing requirements and\nArticle III\u2014\u201care an essential ingredient of separation and\nequilibration of powers.\u201dSteel Co.v.Citizens for\nBetter Environment,523 U. S. 83, 101 (1998).\n\u201cRelaxation of standing requirements is directly related to the\nexpansion of judicial power,\u201d and lowering the taxpayer standing\nbar to permit challenges of purely executive actions \u201cwould\nsignificantly alter the allocation of power at the national level,\nwith a shift away from a democratic form of government.\u201dRichardson, 418 U. S., at 188 (Powell, J., concurring).\nThe rule respondents propose would enlist the federal courts to\nsuperintend, at the behest of any federal taxpayer, the speeches,\nstatements, and myriad daily activities of the President, his\nstaff, and other Executive Branch officials. This would \u201cbe quite\nat odds with \u2026Flast\u2019s own promise that it would not\ntransform federal courts into forums for taxpayers\u2019 \u2018generalized\ngrievances\u2019\u00a0\u201d about the conduct of government,Cuno,\n547 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12) (quotingFlast,supra, at 106), and would \u201copen the Judiciary to an\narguable charge of providing \u2018government by injunction,\u2019\u00a0\u201dSchlesinger, 418 U. S., at 222. It would deputize federal\ncourts as \u201c\u00a0\u2018virtually continuing monitors of the wisdom and\nsoundness of Executive action,\u2019\u00a0\u201d and that, most emphatically,\n\u201cis not the role of the judiciary.\u201dAllen, 468 U. S., at\n760 (quotingLairdv.Tatum,408 U. S. 1, 15\n(1972)).3Both the Court of Appeals and\nrespondents implicitly recognize that unqualified federal taxpayer\nstanding to assert Establishment Clause claims would go too far,\nbut neither the Court of Appeals nor respondents has identified a\nworkable limitation. The Court of Appeals, as noted, conceded only\nthat a taxpayer would lack standing where \u201cthe marginal or\nincremental cost to the taxpaying public of the alleged violation\nof the establishment clause\u201d is \u201czero.\u201d 433 F.\u00a03d, at 995.\nApplying this rule, the Court of Appeals opined that a taxpayer\nwould not have standing to challenge a President\u2019s favorable\nreference to religion in a State of the Union address because the\ncosts associated with the speech \u201cwould be no greater merely\nbecause the President had mentioned Moses rather than John Stuart\nMill.\u201dIbid.There is reason to question\nwhether the Court of Appeals\u2019 intended for its zero-marginal-cost\ntest to be taken literally, because the court, without any apparent\ninquiry into the costs of Secretary Paige\u2019s speech, went on to\nagree that the plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge that speech.Id., at 996. But if we take the Court of Appeals\u2019 test\nliterally\u2014i.e., that any marginal cost greater than zero\nsuffices\u2014taxpayers might well have standing to challenge some (and\nperhaps many) speeches. As Judge Easterbrook observed: \u201cThe total\ncost of presidential proclamations and speeches by Cabinet officers\nthat touch on religion (Thanksgiving and several other holidays)\nsurely exceeds $500,000 annually; it may cost that much to use Air\nForce One and send a Secret Service detail to a single speaking\nengagement.\u201d 447 F.\u00a03d, at 989\u2013990 (concurring in denial of\nrehearing en banc). At a minimum, the Court of Appeals\u2019 approach\n(asking whether the marginal cost exceeded zero) would surely\ncreate difficult and uncomfortable line-drawing problems. Suppose\nthat it is alleged that a speech writer or other staff member spent\nextra time doing research for the purpose of including \u201creligious\nimagery\u201d in a speech. Suppose that a President or a Cabinet officer\nattends or speaks at a prayer breakfast and that the time spent was\ntime that would have otherwise been spent on secular work.Respondents take a somewhat different\napproach, contending that their proposed expansion ofFlastwould be manageable because they would require that\na challenged expenditure be \u201cfairly traceable to the conduct\nalleged to violate the Establishment Clause.\u201d Brief for Respondents\n17. Applying this test, they argue, would \u201cscree[n] out \u2026\nchallenge[s to] the content of one particular speech, for example\nthe State of the Union address, as an Establishment Clause\nviolation.\u201dId., at 21.We find little comfort in this vague and\nill-defined test. As an initial matter, respondents fail to explain\nwhy the (often substantial) costs that attend, for example, a\nPresidential address are any less \u201ctraceable\u201d than the expenses\nrelated to the Executive Branch statements and conferences at issue\nhere. Indeed, respondents concede that even lawsuits involvingde minimisamounts of taxpayer money can pass their\nproposed \u201ctraceability\u201d test.Id., at 20, n.\u00a06.Moreover, the \u201ctraceability\u201d inquiry,\ndepending on how it is framed, would appear to prove either too\nlittle or too much. If the question is whether an allegedly\nunconstitutional executive action can somehow be traced to taxpayer\nfundsin general, the answer will always be yes: Almost\nall Executive Branch activities are ultimately funded bysomecongressional appropriation, whether general or\nspecific, which is in turn financed by tax receipts. If, on the\nother hand, the question is whether the challenged action can be\ntraced to the contributions of aparticulartaxpayer-plaintiff, the answer will almost always be no: As we\nrecognized inFrothingham, the interest of any individual\ntaxpayer in a particular federal expenditure \u201cis comparatively\nminute and indeterminable \u2026 and constantly changing.\u201d 262 U. S., at\n487.BRespondents set out a parade of\nhorribles that they claim could occur ifFlastis not\nextended to discretionary Executive Branch expenditures. For\nexample, they say, a federal agency could use its discretionary\nfunds to build a house of worship or to hire clergy of one\ndenomination and send them out to spread their faith. Or an agency\ncould use its funds to make bulk purchases of Stars of David,\ncrucifixes, or depictions of the star and crescent for use in its\noffices or for distribution to the employees or the general public.\nOf course, none of these things has happened, even thoughFlasthas not previously been expanded in the way that\nrespondents urge. In the unlikely event that any of these executive\nactions did take place, Congress could quickly step in. And\nrespondents make no effort to show that these improbable abuses\ncould not be challenged in federal court by plaintiffs who would\npossess standing based on grounds other than taxpayer standing.COver the years,Flasthas been\ndefended by some and criticized by others. But the present case\ndoes not require us to reconsider that precedent. The Court of\nAppeals did not applyFlast; it extendedFlast.\nIt is a necessary concomitant of the doctrine ofstare\ndecisisthat a precedent is not always expanded to the limit\nof its logic. That was the approach that then-Justice Rehnquist\ntook in his opinion for the Court inValley Forge, and it\nis the approach we take here. We do not extendFlast, but\nwe also do not overrule it. We leaveFlastas we found\nit.Justice Scalia says that we must\neither overruleFlastor extend it to the limits of its\nlogic. His position is not \u201c[in]sane,\u201d inconsistent with the \u201crule\nof law,\u201d or \u201cutterly meaningless.\u201dPost, at 1 (opinion\nconcurring in judgment). But it is wrong. Justice Scalia does not\nseriously dispute either (1) thatFlastitself spoke in\nterms of \u201clegislative enactment[s]\u201d and \u201cexercises of congressional\npower,\u201d 392 U. S., at 102, or (2) that in the four decades sinceFlastwas decided, we have never extended its narrow\nexception to a purely discretionary Executive Branch expenditure.\nWe need go no further to decide this case. Relying on the provision\nof the Constitution that limits our role to resolving the \u201cCases\u201d\nand \u201cControversies\u201d before us, we decide only the case at hand.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*For these reasons, the judgment\nof the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit is reversed.It is so ordered.Footnote 1See,e.g., Exec.

Congress surely understood that much of the aid mandated by\nthe statute would find its way to religious schools.Footnote 4See,e.g., 119 Stat. 2472\n(appropriating $53,830,000 \u201cto be available for allocation within\nthe Executive Office of the President\u201d).Footnote 5Valley Forgealso relied on a second\nrationale: that the authorizing Act was an exercise of Congress\u2019\npower under the Property Clause of Art.
