    "text": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES_________________No. 13-553_________________ALABAMA DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE, et al., PETITIONERSv.CSX TRANSPORTATION, INC.on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for\nthe eleventh circuit[March 4, 2015]Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Ginsburg joins,\ndissenting.In order to violate 49 U.S.C. \u00a711501(b)(4), \u201ca tax exemption\nscheme must target or single out railroads by comparison to general\ncommercial and industrial taxpayers.\u201dCSX Transp., Inc. v.\nAlabama Dept. of Revenue(CSX I), 562 U.S. 277-298\n(2011) (Thomas, J., dissenting). Because CSX cannot prove facts\nthat would satisfy that standard, I would reverse the judgment\nbelow and remand for the entry of judgment in favor of the Alabama\nDepartment of Revenue.IALast time this case was before the Court, I explained in detail\nmy reasons for interpreting \u201canother tax that discriminates against\na rail carrier\u201d in 11501(b)(4) to refer to a tax \u201cthat targets or\nsingles out railroads as compared to other commercial and\nindustrial taxpayers.\u201dId., at 298. I briefly summarize\nthat reasoning here.Because the meaning of \u201cdiscriminates\u201d is ambiguous at first\nglance, I look to the term\u2019s context to resolve this uncertainty.Id., at 298-299. Both the structure and background of the\nstatute indicate that subsection (b)(4) prohibits only taxes that\nsingle out railroads as compared to other commercial and industrial\ntaxpayers.Subsection (b)(4) is a residual clause, the meaning of which is\nbest understood by reference to the provisions that precede it.\nSubsection (b) begins by announcing that \u201c[t]he following acts . .\n. discriminate against interstate commerce\u201d and are prohibited.\n11501(b). Subsections (b)(1) through (3) then list three\ntax-related actions that single out rail carriers by treating rail\nproperty differently from all other commercial and industrial\nproperty. \u00a7\u00a711501(b)(1)-(3);id., at 300. Subsections\n(b)(1) and (b)(3) explicitly identify \u201ccommercial and industrial\nproperty\u201d as the comparison class, and subsection (b)(2)\nincorporates that comparison class by reference. 11501(b);id., at 300. Subsection (b)(4) refers back to these\nprovisions when it forbids \u201c[i]mpos[ing]anothertax that\ndiscriminates against a rail carrier.\u201d \u00a711501(b)(4) (emphasis\nadded);id., at 300). The statutory structure therefore\nsupports the conclusion that a tax discriminates against a rail\ncarrier within the meaning of subsection (b)(4) if it singles out\nrailroads for unfavorable treatment as compared to the general\nclass of commercial and industrial taxpayers.Id., at\n300-301.The statutory background supports the same conclusion. When\nCongress enacted the 4-R Act, it was apparent that railroads were\n\u201ceasy prey for State and local tax assessors in that they are\nnonvoting, often nonresident, targets for local taxation, who\ncannot easily remove themselves from the locality.\u201dId.,\nat 301 (internal quotation marks omitted). Subsections (b)(1)\nthrough (3) thus \u201cestablish a political check\u201d by preventing States\nfrom imposing excessive property taxes on railroads \u201cwithout\nimposing the same taxes more generally on voting, resident local\nbusinesses.\u201dIbid.Subsection (b)(4) is best understood as\naddressing the same problem in the same way.Id., at\n301-302.BAlabama\u2019s tax scheme cannot be said to \u201cdiscriminat[e] against a\nrail carrier.\u201dId., at 302. To begin, the scheme does not\nsingle out rail carriers. Although one would not know it from the\nmajority opinion, the tax is not directed at rail carriers, their\nproperty, their activity, or goods uniquely consumed by them. It is\ninstead a generally applicable sales tax. It applies (with other\nexemptions not at issue here) to all goods purchased, used, or\nstored in the State of Alabama. Ala. Code \u00a7\u00a740-23-2(1), 40-23-61(a)\n(2011). The only relevant good exempted from the tax is diesel on\nwhich the motor fuel tax has been paid, 40-17-325(b), and no\nprovision of law prevents rail carriers from buying such diesel.\nSee Brief for Respondent 46, n. 13 (acknowledging that CSX pays the\nmotor fuel tax on the diesel fuel it uses in trucks and other\non-road vehicles). Water carriers, it is true, enjoy a special\ncarve-out from this sales tax, \u00a740-23-4(a)(10) (Cum. Supp. 2014),\nbut that exemption singles outwatercarriers, notrailcarriers.Even if this constellation of exemptions to Alabama\u2019s sales tax\ncould be said to single out rail carriers from the general class of\ntheir interstate competitors, the tax surely does not single out\nrail carriers as compared to commercial and industrial taxpayers.\nThose taxpayers are subject to exactly the same generally\napplicable sales and use tax regime as are rail carriers.IIAThe Court started off on the wrong track inCSX Iwhen\nit relied on a generic dictionary definition of \u201cdiscriminates\u201d in\nthe face of a statutory context suggesting a more specific\ndefinition. See 562 U.S., at 304. Today\u2019s decision continues that\nerror.The Court uncritically accepts the conclusion that the\n\u201cdiscriminat[ion]\u201d addressed by the statute encompassesanydistinction between rail carriers and their comparison\nclass,ante, at 4, as opposed to mere \u201csingling out\u201d or\nsomething in between, even though the word \u201cdiscriminates\u201d is\nambiguous in that way.CSX I,supra, at 299. The\nCourt\u2019s usual practice has not been to treat the meaning of\n\u201cdiscriminates\u201d so casually. See generallyGuardians Assn. v.\nCivil Serv. Comm\u2019n of New York City, 463 U.S. 582-593 (1983)\n(opinion of White, J.) (discussing the Court\u2019s shifting definition\nof the ambiguous term \u201cdiscrimination\u201d).Today\u2019s decision compounds this error by holding that a rail\ncarrier may make out a claim of discrimination using any comparison\nclass so long as that class consists of \u201cindividuals similarly\nsituated to the claimant\u201d rail carrier.Ante, at 5. The\nmajority purports to derive this limitation from the dictionary,\nbut then finds itself unable to proceed: After all, Black\u2019s Law\nDictionary contains no entry defining what it means to be\n\u201csimilarly situated\u201d for the purpose of subsection (b)(4). Forced\nfinally to turn to the statutory context, the majority rejects the\nstatutorily defined competitor class of commercial and industrial\ntaxpayers in favor of a shifting comparison class of its own\ncreation.BThe majority disregards the commercial and industrial property\ncomparison class identified in subsections (b)(1) through (3)\nbecause subsection (b)(4) does not explicitly include language from\nthose provisions. Seeante, at 4-5, 6-7. It asserts that\ndefining the comparison class for the purpose of subsection (b)(4)\nby reference to the comparison class identified in subsections\n(b)(1) through (b)(3) \u201cwould require us to dragoon the modifier\n\u2018commercial and industrial\u2019\u2014but not the noun \u2018property\u2019\u2014from the\nfirst three provisions, append general in front of it and\n\u2018taxpayers\u2019 after, both words foreign to the preceding\nsubsections.\u201dAnte, at 7.The majority\u2019s accusation of grammatical conscription misses the\npoint. Subsection (b)(4) is a residual clause, explicitly marked as\nsuch by the use of the word another. SeeWashington State Dept.\nof Social and Health Servs. v. Guardianship Estate of\nKeffeler, 537 U.S. 371, 384 (2003) . Like other residual\nclauses, it need not use the same language as the clauses it\nfollows to derive meaning from those clauses. See,e.g.,\nSossamon v. Texas, 563 U.S. 277 , ___ (2011) (slip op., at\n13);James v. United States, 550 U.S. 192-218 (2007)\n(Scalia, J., dissenting). Where, as here, a residual clause\nincludes an ambiguous word like \u201cdiscriminates,\u201d we must look to\nthe clauses that precede it to guide our understanding of its\nscope.In some sense, my task in giving meaning to the statutory term\n\u201cdiscriminates\u201d is no different from the majority\u2019s: to determine\nwhat type of differential treatment the statute forbids. The first\nthree clauses provide important clues that the statute forbids\nsingling out rail carriers from other commercial and industrial\ntaxpayers because commercial and industrial taxpayers are the ones\nwho pay taxes on \u201ccommercial and industrial property.\u201d The majority\npursues the same logical train of thought when it opines that \u201cthe\ncategory of \u2018similarly situated\u2019 (b)(4) comparison classes must\ninclude commercial and indus-trial taxpayers\u201d because \u201c[t]here is\nno conceivable reason why the statute would forbid property taxes\nhigher than what that class enjoys (or suffers), but permit other\ntaxes that discriminate in favor of that class vis-\u00e0-vis railroads.Ante, at 6. Where we part ways is in the inferences we\ndraw from the statutory context.Treating subsection (b)(4) as a residual clause does not require\nthe grammatical distortions that the majority alleges. The word\n\u201cdiscriminates\u201d in subsection (b)(4) is not a referential phrase\nwhose antecedent is uncertain. If it were, then it would be\nnecessary to select an antecedent that would fit grammatically in\nplace of \u201cdiscriminates.\u201d Instead, I look to (b)(1) to (3) merely\nto clarify an ambiguity in themeaningof \u201cdiscriminates,\u201d\na task that does not require me to \u201cdragoon\u201d the language of the\nprior clauses into subsection (b)(4).Nor does my approach rely on the first three clauses of\n\u00a711501(b) to supply a general limitation on the independent\nprohibition that appears in subsection (b)(4). SeeUnited\nStates v. Aguilar, 515 U.S. 593, 615 (1995) (SCALIA, J.,\nconcurring in part and dissenting in part) (criticizing this type\nof argument). That is what Alabama sought to do inCSX Iwhen it argued that subsection (b)(4) is limited to property taxes\n(or their equivalent \u201cin lieu\u201d taxes).Ante, at 7;CSX\nI, 562 U.S., at 285 (majority opinion). I joined the majority\nin rejecting that argument.Id., at 297 (dissenting\nopinion). But whereas there is no uncertainty about the meaning of\n\u201ctaxes\u201d in subsection (b)(4) that would justify importing the\nproperty tax limitation from the three preceding subsections,id., at 284-285 (majority opinion), there is a good deal\nof uncertainty about the meaning of \u201cdiscriminates.\u201d This\nuncertainty justifies looking to the three previous clauses to\nunderstand the type of differential treatment \u00a711501(b) is meant to\nprohibit.Id., at 298-299 (dissenting opinion); seeHarrison v. PPG Industries, Inc., 446 U.S. 578-589 (1980).\nAnd those three previous clauses easily supply the answer to the\ncomparison class question.CUnwilling to so limit the range of available comparison classes,\nthe majority takes an approach to determining which individuals are\n\u201csimilarly situated\u201d for purposes of the statute that \u201cis almost\nentirely ad hoc,\u201dJames,supra, at 215 (SCALIA,\nJ., dissenting). It asserts that the comparison class will\n\u201cdepen[d] on the theory of discrimination alleged in the claim.\u201dAnte, at 4-5. Sometimes the comparison class will be \u201call\nother commercial and industrial taxpayers,\u201d sometimes it will be\n\u201cthe railroad\u2019s competitors\u201d in a particular jurisdiction, and\nsometimes it may be some other comparison class entirely.Id., at 5.The sole evidence on which the majority relies to conclude that\ncompetitors are similarly situated, and therefore qualify as a\ncomparison class, is the professed purposes of the Act: \u201cto\n\u2018restore the financial stability of the railway system of the\nUnited States,\u2019 while \u2018foster[ing] competition among all carriers\nby railroad and other modes of transportation.\u2019\u201dAnte, at\n6 (quoting 90 Stat. 33, \u00a7\u00a7101(a), (b)(2)). Interpreting statutory\ntext solely in light of purpose, absent any reliance on text or\nstructure, is dangerous business because it places courts in peril\nof substituting their policy judgment for that of Congress. In\nconsidering statutory purpose, therefore, we should be careful that\nany inferences of purpose are tied to text rather than\ninstinct.The majority throws such caution to the wind. Its two-sentence\nargument is a perfect illustration of the dangers of a purely\npurpose-based approach. The majority cherry-picks two of a number\nof stated goals of a complex piece of legislation over 100 pages\nlong and assumes that this specific provision was assigned to those\nspecific purposes. And then it interprets the statute to perform in\nthe manner the majority believes is best designed to \u201crestore\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. financial stability\u201d and \u201cfoster .\u00a0.\u00a0.\ncompetition.\u201dAnte, at 6 (alteration omitted).I have no reason to doubt the economic soundness of the\nmajority\u2019s conclusion that discrimination between rail carriers and\ntheir competitors threatens their financial stability and impedes\ncompetition, but I lack the majority\u2019s certitude that \u00a711501(b)(4)\nis designed to furtherthosegoalsby combattingthat evil, at least inthe waythe majority\nasserts. Instead, the first three subsections provide strong\ntextual evidence that \u00a711501(b) was designed to stabilize rail\ncarriers by protecting them from discrimination against interstate\ncommerce. And they provide evidence of Congress\u2019 chosen mechanism\nfor accomplishing that goal: tying the fate of interstate rail\ncarriers to the broader class of commercial and industrial\ntaxpayers. Seesupra, at 2.The introductory clause of \u00a711501(b) provides further evidence\nthat the evil at which subsection (b)(4) is targeted is not\ndiscrimination between rail carriers and their competitors, but\n\u201cacts [that] unreasonably burden and discriminate against\ninterstate commerce.\u201d The majority\u2019s response to this evidence\u2014that\nthe Court rejected a similar argument when it refused to limit\nsubsection (b)(4) to property taxes or their kin,ante, at\n7\u2014is a non sequitur. The introductory clause contains no reference\nto property taxes that \u201cbinds its four subsections together\u201d as\nprohibitions on discriminatory property taxes.Ibid.(internal quotation marks omitted). But itdoeshave a\nreference to discrimination against interstate commerce, whichdoestie the sections together to servethatcommon statutory purpose. This, in turn, weighs against the\nmajority\u2019s inferences about how \u00a711501(b) relates to the stated\npurposes of the 4-R Act.The majority\u2019s conclusion that competitors are a permissible\ncomparison class completely ignores these contextual clues,\npermitting subsection (b)(4) to serve different statutory goals by\na different mechanism than its three predecessor clauses. And it\nleads to odd inconsistencies. If we were to understand the\nprovision as prohibitingonlydiscrimination between rail\ncarriers and their competitors, then it might well further the goal\nof promoting competition between interstate carriers. But the\nmajority instead selects a shifting-comparison-class approach,\nrequiring rail carriers to be treated at least as well as their\ncompetitors andany othersimilarly situated taxpayers.\nSeeante, at 4-5. This most-favored taxpayer status is a\nposition the competitors do not enjoy, so the majority\u2019s position\ncould result in tax schemes thatimpedecompetition\nbetween interstate carriers rather than promote it.Identifying \u201csimilarly situated\u201d taxpayers by the undisciplined\napproach the majority endorses could well lead to other\nunanticipated consequences. This is why the policy judgments needed\nto link statutory mechanisms to statutory purposes are best left to\nCongress. If this Court is going to adopt a\nshifting-comparison-class approach to \u00a711501(b)(4), then it should\nat least demand a stronger textual link between the comparison\nclass a claimant seeks to import into subsection (b)(4) and any\npurpose that the claimant argues it serves.IIIBecause the majority adopts an interpretation of \u00a711501(b)(4)\nthat is not grounded in the text, it should come as no surprise\nthat this interpretation is difficult to apply, as this case\ndemonstrates. It is easy to see how, accepting water carriers as a\ncomparison class, the scheme treats water carriers and rail\ncarriers differently when it grants water carriers, but not rail\ncarriers, an exemption from the sales tax. Ala. Code\n\u00a740-23-4(a)(10). Identifying the difference in treatment between\nrail and motor carriers, by contrast, requires a good deal more\nimagination.The majority\u2019s approach exhibits that imagination. It glosses\nover the general applicability of the provisions that apply to rail\nand motor carriers, stating that \u201c[t]he State applies the [sales or\nuse] tax, at the usual 4% rate, to railroads\u2019 purchase or use of\ndiesel fuel for their rail operations,\u201d but \u201cexempts from the tax\npurchases and uses of diesel fuel made by [motor carriers].\u201dAnte, at 1. A quick glimpse at the code reveals that this\nis not quite the case. The applicability of the sales and use taxes\ndoes not depend on the identity of the purchaser, but on whether\nthe purchaser pays another excise tax, \u00a740-17-325(b), which in turn\ndepends on the nature of the product purchased and its use,\n\u00a7\u00a740-17-328, 40-17-329, which in turn merely correlates to the\ncarriers\u2019 operations.As far as I can tell, the rail carriers use dyed diesel that is\nexempt from the motor fuel tax\u2014and therefore subject to the sales\nand use taxes\u2014as a matter of choice rather than necessity. Dyed\ndiesel has no special properties that make it more suitable for use\nin a train engine; the dye merely identifies it as exempt from the\nfederal excise tax, \u00a740-17-322(21). And no law prohibits rail\ncarriers from using undyed diesel. To the contrary, it is the motor\ncarriers who are prohibited from using the dyed variant for on-road\nuse.Assumingarguendothat state law provides that only\ndyed diesel may be used in rail operations, it becomes a little\neasier to make an argument that the State treats rail carriers\ndifferentlyin this case. But the majority still faces a\nline-drawing problem. Is it necessary that the good subject to the\nchallenged tax be the same as the good on which the competitor\nenjoys an exemption? Could a rail carrier that relies on natural\ngas rather than diesel for motive power make the same claim of\ndiscrimination if natural gas is not entitled to the same sales-tax\nexemption as diesel? Is it necessary that the rail carrier and its\ncompetitor rely on the good for the same purpose? Could a rail\ncarrier that uses diesel for motive power challenge a hypothetical\nprovision that exempted from the sales and use taxes diesel that\nmotor carriers use for refrigeration in refrigerated trailers?The majority never answers these questions. \u201cSufficient unto the\nday is the evil thereof,\u201d it intones.Ante, at 6. \u201cThat\ngets this case off our docket, sure enough. But it utterly fails to\ndo what this Court is supposed to do: provide guidance concrete\nenough to ensure that the\u201d statute is applied consistently.James, 550 U.S., at 215 (SCALIA, J., dissenting). We have\ndemanded clarity from Congress when it comes to statutes that\n\u201cse[t] limits upon the taxation authority of state government, an\nauthority we have recognized as central to state sovereignty.\u201dDepartment of Revenue of Ore. v. ACF Industries, Inc., 510\nU.S. 332-345 (1994). We should demand the same of ourselves when we\ninterpret those statutes. Yet after today\u2019s decision, lower courts,\nsoon to be met with an oyster\u2019s shellful of comparison classes,ante, at 5, will have no idea how to determine when a tax\nexemption that is not tied to the taxpayer\u2019s status constitutes\ndifferential treatment of two taxpayers.* * *The majority\u2019s interpretation of \u00a711501(b)(1) derails ambiguous\ntext from clarifying context. The result it reaches is predictably\nunworkable. And it prolongs Alabama\u2019s burden of litigating a\nbaseless claim of discrimination that should have been dismissed\nlong ago. I respectfully dissent.",
