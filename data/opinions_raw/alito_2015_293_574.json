    "text": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES_________________No. 13\u2013975_________________T-MOBILE SOUTH, LLC, PETITIONERv.CITY OF ROSWELL,\nGEORGIAon writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for\nthe eleventh circuit[January 14, 2015]Justice Alito, concurring.I concur in the Court\u2019s opinion because I agree that Congress,\nby using the term \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d intended to invoke\nadministrative law principles. One such principle, as the Court\nexplains, is the requirement that agencies give reasons. I write\nseparately, however, because three other traditional administrative\nlaw principles may also apply.First, a court must \u201cuphold a decision of less than ideal\nclarity if the agency\u2019s path may reasonably be discerned.\u201dBowman Transp., Inc.v.Arkansas-Best Freight System,\nInc.,419 U. S. 281,286 (1974). In the context of47\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7332(c)(7), which leaves in place almost the\nentirety of a local government\u2019s authority, a succinct statement\nthat a permit has been denied because the tower would be\nesthetically incompatible with the surrounding area should suffice.\nNothing in this statute imposes an opinion-writing requirement.Second, even if a locality has erred, a court must not\ninvalidate the locality\u2019s decision if the error was harmless. \u201cIn\nadministrative law, as in federal civil and criminal litigation,\nthere is a harmless error rule.\u201dNational Assn. of Home\nBuildersv.Defenders of Wildlife,551 U.\u00a0S. 644\u2013660\n(2007) (internal quotation marks omitted). Here, for instance, I\nhave trouble believing that T-Mobile South, LLC\u2014which actively\nparticipated in the decisionmaking process, including going so far\nas to transcribe the public hearing\u2014was prejudiced by the city of\nRoswell\u2019s delay in providing a copy of the minutes.Third, the ordinary rule in administrative law is that a court\nmust remand errors to the agency \u201cexcept in rare circumstances.\u201dFlorida Power & Light Co.v.Lorion,470\nU.\u00a0S. 729,744 (1985). Nothing we say today should be read to\nsuggest that when a locality has erred, the inevitable remedy is\nthat a tower must be built. The Court has not passed on what\nremedial powers a \u201ccourt of competent jurisdiction\u201d may exercise.\n\u00a7332(c)(7)(B)(v). This unanswered question is important given the\nfederalism implications of this statute.I do not understand the Court\u2019s opinion to disagree with this\nanalysis. On that understanding, I join the Court\u2019s opinion.",
