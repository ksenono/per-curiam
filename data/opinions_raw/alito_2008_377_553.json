S. ____ (2008)SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESNO. 06-1646UNITED STATES, PETITIONERv.GINO\nRODRIQUEZon writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the ninth circuit[May 19, 2008]Justice Alito delivered the\nopinion of the Court.Under the Armed Career Criminal\nAct (ACCA), 18 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7924(e)(2)(A)(ii), a state\ndrug-trafficking conviction qualifies as \u201ca serious drug offense\u201d\nif \u201ca maximum term of imprisonment of ten years or more is\nprescribed by law\u201d for the \u201coffense.\u201d The Court of Appeals for the\nNinth Circuit held that \u201cthe maximum term of imprisonment . . .\nprescribed by law\u201d must be determined without taking recidivist\nenhancements into account. 464 F.\u00a03d 1072, 1082 (2006). We\nreverse.IAt issue in this case is\nrespondent\u2019s sentence on his 2004 conviction in the United States\nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of Washington for\npossession of a firearm by a convicted felon, in violation of 18 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a7922(g)(1). Respondent had two prior state convictions\nin California for residential burglary and three state convictions\nin Washington for delivery of a controlled substance, in violation\nof Wash. Rev. Code \u00a7\u00a769.50.401(a)(1)(ii)\u2013(iv) (1994).[Footnote 1] Respondent\u2019s three Washington\ndrug convictions occurred on the same day but were based on\ndeliveries that took place on three separate dates. Sentencing\nOrder No. CR\u201303\u2013142\u2013RHW (ED Wash., Sept. 3, 2004), p. 5, App. 245,\n250 (hereinafter Sentencing Order). At the time of respondent\u2019s\ndrug offenses, the Washington statute that respondent was convicted\nof violating stated that, upon conviction, a defendant could be\n\u201cimprisoned for not more than five years,\u201d\n\u00a7\u00a769.50.401(a)(1)(ii)\u2013(iv),but another provision\nspecified that \u201c[a]ny person convicted of a second or subsequent\noffense\u201d could \u201cbe imprisoned for a term up to twice the term\notherwise authorized,\u201d \u00a769.50.408(a). Thus, by virtue of this\nlatter, recidivist, provision respondent faced a maximum penalty of\nimprisonment for 10 years. The judgment of conviction for each of\nthe drug-delivery charges listed the maximum term of imprisonment\nfor the offense as \u201cten years,\u201d App. 16, 42, 93, but the state\ncourt sentenced respondent to concurrent sentences of 48 months\u2019\nimprisonment on each count.Id.,at 21, 47, 98.In the federal\nfelon-in-possession case, the Government asked the District Court\nto sentence respondent under ACCA, which sets a 15-year minimum\nsentence \u201c[i]n the case of a person who violates section 922(g) of\n[Title 18] and has three previous convictions . . . for a violent\nfelony or a serious drug offense, or both, committed on occasions\ndifferent from one another \u2026\u00a0.\u201d 18 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7924(e)(1)\n(2000 ed., Supp. V). The Government argued that respondent\u2019s two\nprior California burglary convictions were for \u201c\u00a0\u2018violent\nfelonies.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Pet. for Cert. 4. See \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii) (2000\ned.) (listing \u201cburglary\u201d as a \u201cviolent felony\u201d). The District Court\nagreed, and that ruling is not at issue here.The Government also argued that at least two\nof respondent\u2019s Washington drug convictions were for \u201cserious drug\noffense[s].\u201d Under ACCA, a \u201cserious drug offense\u201d includes:\u201can offense under State law, involving\nmanufacturing, distributing, or possessing with intent to\ndistribute, a controlled substance (as defined in section 102 of\nthe Controlled Substances Act (21 U. S.\u00a0C. 802)),for\nwhich a maximum term of imprisonment of ten years or more is\nprescribed by law.\u201d \u00a7924(e)(2)(A) (emphasis added).Because the maximum term that respondent faced on\nat least two of the Washington charges was 10 years, the Government\ncontended that these convictions had to be counted under ACCA. The\nDistrict Court disagreed, holding that respondent\u2019s\ndrug-trafficking convictions were not convictions for \u201cserious drug\noffense[s]\u201d under ACCA because the \u201cmaximum term of imprisonment\u201d\nfor the purposes of \u00a7924(e)(2)(A)(ii) is determined without\nreference to recidivist enhancements. Sentencing Order, at 9, App.\n254.The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit,\napplying its prior precedent inUnited Statesv.Corona-Sanchez, 291 F.\u00a03d 1201 (2002) (en banc),\naffirmed. 464 F.\u00a03d 1072. The Court recognized that its\ndecision conflicted with the Seventh Circuit\u2019s decision inUnited Statesv.Henton, 374 F.\u00a03d 467,\n469\u2013470, cert. denied,543 U. S. 967(2004),\nand was \u201cin tension\u201d with decisions of the Fourth and Fifth\nCircuits. 464 F.\u00a03d, at 1082, n.\u00a06; seeMutascuv.Gonzales, 444 F.\u00a03d 710, 712 (CA5 2006)(per\ncuriam);United Statesv.Williams, 326 F.\n3d 535, 539 (CA4 2003). We granted the Government\u2019s petition for a\nwrit of certiorari, 551 U. S. ___ (2007).IIThe question that we must decide\nis whether the \u201cmaximum term of imprisonment prescribed by law\u201d in\nthis case is, as respondent maintains and the Ninth Circuit held,\nthe 5-year ceiling for first offenses or, as the Government\ncontends, the 10-year ceiling for second or subsequent offenses.\nSee Wash. Rev. Code \u00a7\u00a769.50.401(a) (ii)\u2013(iv), 69.50.408(a).The Government\u2019s reading is\ncompelled by the language of ACCA. For present purposes, there are\nthree key statutory terms: \u201coffense,\u201d \u201claw,\u201d and \u201cmaximum term.\u201d\nThe \u201coffense\u201d in each of the drug-delivery cases was a violation of\n\u00a7\u00a769.50.401(a)(ii)\u2013(iv). The relevant \u201claw\u201d is set out in both that\nprovision, which prescribes a \u201cmaximum term\u201d of five years for a\nfirst \u201coffense,\u201d and \u00a769.50.408(a), which prescribes a \u201cmaximum\nterm\u201d of 10 years for a second or subsequent \u201coffense.\u201d Thus, in\nthis case, the maximum term prescribed by Washington law for at\nleast two of respondent\u2019s state drug offenses was 10 years.The Ninth Circuit\u2019s holding that the maximum\nterm was five years contorts ACCA\u2019s plain terms. Although the\nWashington state court sentenced respondent to 48 months\u2019\nimprisonment, there is no dispute that \u00a769.50.408(a) permitted a\nsentence of up to 10 years. On the Ninth Circuit\u2019s reading of ACCA,\neven if respondent had been sentenced to, say, six years\u2019\nimprisonment, \u201cthe maximum term of imprisonment\u201d prescribed by law\nstill would have been five years. It is hard to accept the\nproposition that a defendant may lawfully be sentenced to a term of\nimprisonment that exceeds the \u201cmaximum term of imprisonment . . .\nprescribed by law,\u201d but that is where the Ninth Circuit\u2019s reading\nof the statute leads.The Ninth Circuit\u2019s interpretation is also\ninconsistent with the way in which the concept of the \u201cmaximum term\nof imprisonment\u201d is customarily understood by participants in the\ncriminal justice process. Suppose that a defendant who indisputably\nhad more than three prior convictions for \u201cviolent felon[ies]\u201d or\n\u201cserious drug offense[s]\u201d was charged in federal court with\nviolating the felon-in-possession statute. Under ACCA, this\ndefendant would face a sentence of \u201cnot less than 15 years.\u201d 18 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a7924(e)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. V). Suppose that the\ndefendant asked his or her attorney, \u201cWhat\u2019s the maximum term I\nface for the new offense?\u201d An attorney aware of ACCA would surely\nnot respond, \u201c10 years,\u201d even though 10 years is the maximum\nsentence without the ACCA enhancement. See \u00a7924(a)(2) (2000\ned.).Suppose that the defendant then pleaded guilty\nto the felon-in-possession charge. Under Federal Rule of Criminal\nProcedure 11(b)(1)(H), the trial judge would be required to advise\nthe defendant of the \u201cmaximum possible penalty.\u201d If the judge told\nthe defendant that the maximum possible sentence was 10 years and\nthen imposed a sentence of 15 years based on ACCA, the defendant\nwould have been sorely misled and would have a ground for moving to\nwithdraw the plea. SeeUnited Statesv.Gonzalez,\n420 F.\u00a03d 111, 132 (CA2 2005);United Statesv.Harrington, 354 F.\u00a03d 178, 185\u2013186 (CA2 2004). In\nsum, a straightforward application of the language of ACCA leads to\nthe conclusion that the \u201cmaximum term of imprisonment prescribed by\nlaw\u201d in this case was 10 years.IIIAIn an effort to defend the Ninth\nCircuit\u2019s decision, respondent offers both a textual argument and a\nrelated argument based on the \u201cmanifest purpose\u201d of ACCA. Brief for\nRespondent 8.Respondent\u2019s textual argument is\nas follows. The term \u201coffense\u201d \u201cgenerally is understood to describe\nthe elements constituting the crime.\u201dId., at 10. Because\nprior convictions required for recidivist enhancements are not\ntypically offense elements, they should not be considered part of\nthe \u201coffense\u201d under ACCA. Thus, the \u201cmaximum term of imprisonment\nprescribed by law\u201d for the drug convictions at issue was the\nmaximum term prescribed for simply committing the elements of the\ndrug offense and was therefore five years.Id., at\n10\u201311.Respondent\u2019s argument is not faithful to the\nstatutory text. Respondent reads ACCA as referring to \u201cthe maximum\nterm of imprisonment prescribed by law\u201d for a defendantwith no\nprior convictions that trigger a recidivist enhancement, but\nthat is not what ACCA says. ACCA instead refers to \u201cthe maximum\nterm of imprisonment prescribed by law\u201d for \u201can offense,\u201d and, as\npreviously explained, in this case, the maximum term prescribed by\nWashington law for each of respondent\u2019s two relevant offenses was\n10 years.Respondent\u2019s argument based on ACCA\u2019s\n\u201cmanifest purpose\u201d must also be rejected. Respondent argues that\nACCA uses \u201cthe maximum penalty specified for the offense by state\nlaw as a short-hand means of identifying conduct deemed\nsufficiently \u2018serious\u2019 to trigger [the] mandatory penalty.\u201dId., at 9. According to respondent, \u201c[t]he nature of [a\ndefendant\u2019s] conduct, the elements of the offense, and the impact\nof the crime . . . are the characteristics that typically are used\nto gauge the \u2018seriousness\u2019 of an offense,\u201d and a defendant\u2019s\n\u201cstatus as a recidivist has no connection to whether the offense\ncommitted by the defendant was a \u2018serious\u2019 one.\u201dId.,at 11.This argument rests on the erroneous\nproposition that a defendant\u2019s prior record of convictions has no\nbearing on the seriousness of an offense. On the contrary, however,\nan offense committed by a repeat offender is often thought to\nreflect greater culpability and thus to merit greater punishment.\nSimilarly, a second or subsequent offense is often regarded as more\nserious because it portends greater future danger and therefore\nwarrants an increased sentence for purposes of deterrence and\nincapacitation. SeeWittev.United States,515 U. S. 389,\n403 (1995);Spencerv.Texas,385 U. S. 554, 570\n(1967) (Warren, C.\u00a0J., dissenting in two judgments and\nconcurring in one).If respondent were correct that a defendant\u2019s\nrecord of prior convictions has no bearing on the seriousness of an\noffense, then it would follow that any increased punishment imposed\nunder a recidivist provision would not be based on the offense of\nconviction but on something else\u2014presumably the defendant\u2019s prior\ncrimes or the defendant\u2019s \u201cstatus as a recidivist,\u201d Brief for\nRespondent 11. But we have squarely rejected this understanding of\nrecidivism statutes. InNicholsv.United States,511 U. S. 738(1994), we explained that \u201c\u00a0\u2018[t]his Court consistently has\nsustained repeat-offender laws as penalizing only the last offense\ncommitted by the defendant.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId., at 747 (quotingBaldasarv.Illinois,446 U. S. 222, 232\n(1980) (Powell, J., dissenting)). When a defendant is given a\nhigher sentence under a recidivism statute\u2014or for that matter, when\na sentencing judge, under a guidelines regime or a discretionary\nsentencing system, increases a sentence based on the defendant\u2019s\ncriminal history\u2014100% of the punishment is for the offense of\nconviction. None is for the prior convictions or the defendant\u2019s\n\u201cstatus as a recidivist.\u201d The sentence \u201cis a stiffened penalty for\nthe latest crime, which is considered to be an aggravated offense\nbecause [it is] a repetitive one.\u201dGrygerv.Burke,334\nU. S. 728, 732 (1948).BRespondent argues that our\ninterpretation of ACCA produces \u201ca sort of perverse bootstrapping\u201d\nunder which a defendant is \u201cpunished under federal law for being\ntreated as a recidivist under state law,\u201d Brief for Respondent 20\n(emphasis deleted), but the fact that ACCA is itself a recidivist\nstatute bolsters our reading. Since ACCA is a recidivist statute,\nCongress must have had such provisions in mind and must have\nunderstood that the \u201cmaximum penalty prescribed by [state] law\u201d in\nsome cases would be increased by state recidivism provisions.Contrary to respondent\u2019s\nsuggestion,United Statesv.LaBonte,520 U. S. 751(1997),\nsupports our interpretation of ACCA. The statute at issue inLaBonte, a provision of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984,\nas amended, 28 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7994(h), directed the United States\nSentencing Commission to \u201cassure\u201d that the Sentencing Guidelines\nspecify a prison sentence \u201cat or near the maximum term authorized\nfor categories of\u201d adult offenders who commit their third felony\ndrug offense or violent crime. We held that the phrase \u201cmaximum\nterm authorized\u201d \u201crefers to all applicable statutes,\u201d including\nrecidivist enhancements. 520 U. S., at 758, n.\u00a04.Respondent claims thatLaBontesupports his position because ACCA, unlike 28 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7994(h), does not refer to \u201ccategories of\u201d offenders. Respondent\nsuggests that Congress\u2019 failure to include such language in ACCA\nmeans that Congress intended to refer to a \u201cmaximum term\u201d that does\nnot depend on whether a defendant falls into the\nfirst-time-offender or recidivist \u201ccategory.\u201d Respondent does not\nexplain how 18 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7924(e)(2)(A) could have easily been\nreworded to mirror 28 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7994(h). But in any event, the\nlanguage used in ACCA, for the reasons explained above, is more\nthan clear enough.Respondent argues that the Ninth Circuit\u2019s\ndecision is supported by the so-called \u201ccategorical\u201d approach that\nwe used inTaylorv.United States,495 U. S. 575(1990), in\ndetermining which offenses qualify as \u201cviolent felon[ies]\u201d under 18\nU. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii). Section 924(e)(2)(B)(ii) provides\nthat four enumerated crimes\u2014burglary, arson, extortion, and\noffenses involving the use of explosives\u2014are \u201cviolent felon[ies]\u201d\nfor ACCA purposes. InTaylor,we held that Congress\nintended for these crimes to have a \u201cuniform definition\u201d that was\n\u201cindependent of the labels employed by the various States\u2019 criminal\ncodes.\u201dId., at 592. According to respondent, \u201c[t]he\ncategorical approach rests on the congressional intent\u2014reflected in\nthe statutory language\u2014to focus the ACCA inquiry on the offense of\nconviction, rather than on collateral matters unrelated to the\ndefinition of the crime.\u201d Brief for Respondent 12.We see no connection, however, between the\nissue inTaylor(the meaning of the term \u201cburglary\u201d in\n\u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii)) and the issue here (the meaning of the phrase\n\u201cmaximum term of imprisonment . . . prescribed by law\u201d under\n\u00a7924(e)(2)(A)(ii)).Taylorheld that the meaning of\n\u201cburglary\u201d for purposes of ACCA does not depend on the label\nattached by the law of a particular State, 495 U. S., at 600\u2013601,\nbut the \u201cmaximum penalty prescribed by law\u201d for a state offense\nnecessarily depends on state law.For a similar reason, we reject respondent\u2019s\nargument that, under our interpretation, offenses that are not\nreally serious will be included as \u201cserious drug offense[s]\u201d\nbecause of recidivist enhancements. In \u00a7924(e)(2)(A)(ii), Congress\nchose to rely on the \u201cmaximum term of imprisonment . . .\nprescribed\u201d by state law as the measure of the seriousness of state\noffenses involving the manufacture, distribution, or possession of\nillegal drugs. Congress presumably thought\u2014not without reason\u2014that\nif state lawmakers provide that a crime is punishable by 10 years\u2019\nimprisonment, the lawmakers must regard the crime as \u201cserious,\u201d and\nCongress chose to defer to the state lawmakers\u2019 judgment.\nTherefore, our interpretation poses no risk that a drug-trafficking\noffense will be treated as a \u201cserious\u201d without satisfying the\nstandard that Congress prescribed.[Footnote 2]CRespondent argues that it will\noften be difficult to determine whether a defendant faced the\npossibility of a recidivist enhancement in connection with a past\nstate drug conviction and that therefore our interpretation of ACCA\nwill require the federal courts to \u201cengage in difficult inquiries\nregarding novel questions of state law and complex factual\ndeterminations about long-past proceedings in state courts.\u201d Brief\nfor Respondent 21. Respondent greatly exaggerates the problems to\nwhich he refers.First, in some cases, a defendant\nwill have received a recidivist enhancement, and this will\nnecessarily be evident from the length of the sentence imposed.\nSecond, as the present case illustrates, see App. 16, 42, 93, the\njudgment of conviction will sometimes list the maximum possible\nsentence even where the sentence that was imposed did not exceed\nthe top sentence allowed without any recidivist enhancement. Third,\nas respondent himself notes, some jurisdictions require that the\nprosecution submit a formal charging document in order to obtain a\nrecidivist enhancement. See Brief for Respondent 33. Such documents\nfall within the limited list of generally available documents that\ncourts already consult for the purpose of determining if a past\nconviction qualifies as an ACCA predicate. SeeShepardv.United States,544 U. S. 13, 20 (2005).\nFourth, in those cases in which the defendant pleaded guilty to the\nstate drug charges, the plea colloquy will very often include a\nstatement by the trial judge regarding the maximum penalty. This is\nmandated by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(b)(1)(H), and\nmany States have similar requirements.[Footnote 3] Finally, in those cases in which the records\nthat may properly be consulted do not show that the defendant faced\nthe possibility of a recidivist enhancement, it may well be that\nthe Government will be precluded from establishing that a\nconviction was for a qualifying offense. The mere possibility that\nsome future cases might present difficulties cannot justify a\nreading of ACCA that disregards the clear meaning of the statutory\nlanguage.DRespondent\u2019s last argument is\nthat if recidivist enhancements can increase the \u201cmaximum term\u201d of\nimprisonment under ACCA, it must follow that mandatory guidelines\nsystems that cap sentences can decrease the \u201cmaximum term\u201d of\nimprisonment. Brief for Respondent 38. In each situation,\nrespondent argues, the \u201cmaximum term\u201d of imprisonment is the term\nto which the state court could actually have sentenced the\ndefendant. Respondent concedes that he has waived this argument\nwith respect to his own specific state-court convictions. See Brief\nin Opposition 15, n.\u00a07. He argues, however, that Congress\ncannot have wanted to make the \u201cmaximum term\u201d of imprisonment for\nACCA purposes dependent on the complexities of state sentencing\nguidelines. We conclude, however, that the phrase \u201cmaximum term of\nimprisonment . . . prescribed by law\u201d for the \u201coffense\u201d was not\nmeant to apply to the top sentence in a guidelines range.First, the top sentence in a\nguidelines range is generally not really the \u201cmaximum term . . .\nprescribed by law\u201d for the \u201coffense\u201d because guidelines systems\ntypically allow a sentencing judge to impose a sentence that\nexceeds the top of the guidelines range under appropriate\ncircumstances. The United States Sentencing Guidelines, for\nexample, permit \u201cupward departures,\u201d see United States Sentencing\nCommission, Guidelines Manual \u00a75K2.0 (Nov. 2007), and essentially\nthe same characteristic was shared by all of the mandatory\nguidelines system in existence at the time of the enactment of the\nACCA provision at issue in this case.[Footnote 4] (Following this pattern, Washington law\nlikewise provided at the time of respondent\u2019s state convictions\nthat a sentencing judge could \u201cimpose a sentence outside the\nstandard sentence range\u201d upon a finding \u201cthat there [were]\nsubstantial and compelling reasons justifying an exceptional\nsentence.\u201d Wash. Rev. Code \u00a79.94A.120(2) (1994).[Footnote 5])Second, the concept of the \u201cmaximum\u201d term of\nimprisonment or sentence prescribed by law was used in many\nstatutes that predated the enactment of ACCA and the federal\nSentencing Reform Act of 1984, Pub. L. 98\u2013473, \u00a7211, 98 Stat. 1987,\nand in all those statutes the concept necessarily referred to the\nmaximum term prescribed by the relevant criminal statute, not the\ntop of a sentencing guideline range. See,e.g.,18 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a73 (1982 ed.) (\u201c[A]n accessory after the fact shall be\nimprisoned not more than one-half the maximum term of imprisonment\n\u2026 for the punishment of the principal\u201d); \u00a73575(b) (allowing for an\nincreased sentence for dangerous special offenders \u201cnot\ndisproportionate in severity to the maximum term otherwise\nauthorized by law for\u201d the underlying felony); see also \u00a7371 (the\npunishment for conspiracy to commit a misdemeanor \u201cshall not exceed\nthe maximum punishment provided for such misdemeanor\u201d); \u00a73651\n(allowing for confinement and suspension of sentence upon\nconviction of an offense not punishable by death or life\nimprisonment \u201cif the maximum sentence for such offense is more than\nsix months\u201d); \u00a73653 (referring to the \u201cmaximum probation\nperiod\u201d).It is instructive that, even in the Sentencing\nReform Act, the concept of the \u201cmaximum term of imprisonment\u201d\nprescribed for an offense was used in this sense. See \u00a7212, 98\nStat. 1991\u20131992 (new 18 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a73559 classifying offenses\nbased on \u201cthe maximum term of imprisonment authorized \u2026 by the\nstatute describing the offense\u201d); \u00a7235(b)(1)(F), 98 Stat. 2032\n(\u201cThe maximum term of imprisonment in effect on the effective date\n[of the Sentencing Reform Act]\u201d remains in effect for five years\nafter the effective date \u201cfor an offense committed before the\neffective date\u201d); \u00a71003(a),id.,at 2138 (solicitation to\ncommit a crime of violence punishable by \u201cone-half the maximum term\nof imprisonment . . . prescribed for the punishment of the crime\nsolicited\u201d). In light of this established pattern and the relative\nnewness of sentencing guidelines systems when the ACCA provision at\nissue here was added, we conclude that Congress meant for the\nconcept of the \u201cmaximum term of imprisonment\u201d prescribed by law for\nan \u201coffense\u201d to have same meaning in ACCA.Our decision inUnited Statesv.R. L. C.,503 U. S. 291(1992), is\nnot to the contrary. The statutory provision there, 18 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a75037(c) (2000 ed.), set out the term of official\ndetention for a juvenile found to be a delinquent. This provision\nwas amended by the Sentencing Reform Act, see \u00a7214, 98 Stat. 2013,\nand then amended again two years later, see \u00a7\u00a721(a)(2)\u2013(4), 100\nStat. 3596. As thus amended, the provision did not refer to the\n\u201cmaximum term of imprisonment\u201d prescribed for an \u201coffense.\u201d Rather,\nthe provision focused on the particular juvenile being sentenced.\nIt provided that, \u201c\u00a0\u2018in the case of a juvenile who is less\nthan eighteen years old,\u2019\u00a0\u201d official detention could not\nextend beyond the earlier of two dates: the juvenile\u2019s 21st\nbirthday or \u201c\u00a0\u2018the maximum term of imprisonment that would be\nauthorized if the juvenile had been tried and convicted as an\nadult.\u2019\u00a0\u201dUnited Statesv.R.L.C.,supra, at\n295\u2013296, n.\u00a01 (quoting 18 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a75037(c)). Because\nthis provision clearly focuses on the circumstances of the\nparticular juvenile and not on the offense, 503 U. S., at 299, it\nis not analogous to the ACCA provision that is before us in this\ncase.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*For these reasons, we hold that\nthe \u201cmaximum term of imprisonment \u2026 prescribed by law\u201d for the\nstate drug convictions at issue in this case was the 10-year\nmaximum set by the applicable recidivist provision. Accordingly, we\nreverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case\nfor further proceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.Footnote 1\u201cExcept as authorized by this chapter, it is\nunlawful for any person to manufacture, deliver, or possess with\nintent to manufacture or deliver a controlled substance.\u201d Wash.\nRev. Code \u00a769.50.401(a)(1994).Footnote 2In any event, the only \u201cminor drug crime\u201d\nthat respondent identifies as potentially constituting an ACCA\npredicate based on recidivist enhancement is distribution of a 21\nU. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7812, Schedule III narcotic in violation of Mich.\nComp. Laws Ann. \u00a7333.7401(2)(b)(ii) (West Supp. 2007). Given that\nSchedule III substances include anabolic steroids and painkillers\nwith specified amounts of certain narcotics like opium, see 21 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a7812, one might debate respondent\u2019s assertion that\ndistribution of these narcotics is not \u201cserious\u201d in the generic\nsense of the word. However, Congress chose to defer to the Michigan\nLegislature\u2019s judgment that the offense was \u201cserious\u201d enough to\nwarrant punishment of first offenses by up to seven years\u2019\nimprisonment, and certain repeat offenses by a maximum term of life\nimprisonment.
