InChristiansburg\nGarment Co.v.EEOC, 434 U. S. 412 (1978) , this Court\nconcluded that a prevailing plaintiff \u201cordinarily is to be awarded\nattorney\u2019s fees in all but special circumstances,\u201d but a prevailing\ndefendant is to be awarded fees only \u201cupon a finding that the\nplaintiff\u2019s action was frivolous, unreasonable, or without\nfoundation.\u201dId.,at 417, 421. That holding \u201cmistak-enly\ncast aside the statutory language\u201d in interpreting the phrase\n\u201cprevailing party.\u201dFogertyv.Fantasy, Inc., 510\nU.\u00a0S. 517, 538 (1994) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). In this case, the Court of\nAppeals compoundedChristiansburg\u2019s error by requiring a\ndistrict court to make yet another finding before a Title VII\ndefendant may be considered a \u201cprevailing party\u201d: The defendant\nmust also obtain a \u201cruling on the merits.\u201d 774 F.\u00a03d 1169,\n1181 (2014). Today, the Court correctly vacates that ruling and\nholds that \u201ca favorable ruling on the merits is not a necessary\npredicate to find that a defendant has prevailed.\u201dAnte, at\n1. I therefore join the Court\u2019s opinion in full. Nevertheless, I\ncontinue to adhere to my view thatChristiansburgis a\n\u201cdubious precedent\u201d that I will \u201cdecline to extend\u201d any further.Fogerty,supra, at 539 (opinion of Thomas, J.).",
