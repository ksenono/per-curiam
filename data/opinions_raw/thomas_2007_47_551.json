Safeco did not send notices\nto new customers because it took the position that the initial\ninsurance rate it offered a customer could not be an \u201cincrease in\nany charge for . . . insurance\u201d under 15 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a71681a(k)(1)(B)(i). The Court properly holds that regardless of the\nmerits of this interpretation, it is not an unreasonable one, and\nSafeco therefore did not act willfully.Ante, at 18\u201321. I\ndo not join Part III\u2013A of the Court\u2019s opinion, however, because it\nresolves the merits of Safeco\u2019s interpretation of\n\u00a71681a(k)(1)(B)(i)\u2014an issue not necessary to the Court\u2019s conclusion\nand not briefed or argued by the parties.",
