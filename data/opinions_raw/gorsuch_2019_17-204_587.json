Yet today the Court lets a\npass-on case proceed. It does so by recastingIllinois Brickas a rule forbidding only suits where the plaintiff does not\ncontract directly with the defendant. This replaces a rule of\nproximate cause and economic reality with an easily manipulated and\nformalistic rule of contractual privity. That\u2019s not how antitrust\nlaw is supposed to work, and it\u2019s an uncharitable way of treating a\nprecedent which\u2014whatever its flaws\u2014is far more sensible than the\nrule the Court installs in its place.ITo understandIllinois Brick, it helps\nto start with the case that paved the way for that decision:Hanover Shoe, Inc.v.United Shoe Machinery Corp.,392 U.S.\n481(1968). Hanover sued United, a company that supplied\nmachinery Hanover used to make shoes. Hanover alleged that United\u2019s\nillegal monopoly in the shoe-making-machinery market had allowed it\nto charge supracompetitive prices. As damages, Hanover sought to\nrecover the amount it had overpaid United for machinery. United\nreplied that Hanover hadn\u2019t been damaged at all because, United\nasserted, Hanover had not absorbed the supposedly \u201cillegal\novercharge\u201d but had \u201cpassed the cost on to its customers\u201d by\nraising the prices it charged for shoes.Id., at 487\u2013488,\nand n.\u00a06. This Court called United\u2019s argument a\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018passing-on\u2019 defense\u201d because it suggested that a court\nshould consider whether an antitrust plaintiff had \u201cpassed on\u201d the\ndefendant\u2019s overcharge to its own customers when assessing if and\nto what degree the plaintiff was injured by the defendant\u2019s\nanticompetitive conduct.Id., at 488.This Court rejected that defense. While \u00a74 of\nthe Clayton Act allows private suits for those injured by antitrust\nviolations, we have long interpreted this language against the\nbackdrop of the common law. See,e.g.,Associated Gen.\nContractors of Cal., Inc.v.Carpenters,459 U.S.\n519, 529\u2013531 (1983). And under ancient rules of proximate\ncausation, the \u201c\u00a0\u2018general tendency of the law, in regard to\ndamages at least, is not to go beyond the first step.\u2019\u00a0\u201dHanover Shoe, 392 U.\u00a0S., at 490, n.\u00a08 (quotingSouthern Pacific Co.v.Darnell-Taenzer Lumber Co.,245 U.S.\n531, 533 (1918)). InHanover Shoe, the first step was\nUnited\u2019s overcharging of Hanover. To proceed beyond that and\ninquire whether Hanover had passed on the overcharge to its\ncustomers, the Court held, would risk the sort of problems\ntraditional principles of proximate cause were designed to avoid.\n\u201c[N]early insuperable\u201d questions would follow about whether Hanover\nhad the capacity and incentive to pass on to its customers in the\nshoe-making market United\u2019s alleged monopoly rent from the separate\nshoe-making-machinery market. 392 U.\u00a0S., at 493. Resolving\nthose questions would, in turn, necessitate a trial within a trial\nabout Hanover\u2019s power and conduct in its own market, with the\nattendant risk that proceedings would become \u201clong and complicated\u201d\nand would \u201cinvolv[e] massive evidence and complicated theories.\u201dIbid.Illinois Brickwas just the other side of\nthe coin. WithHanover Shoehaving held that an antitrustdefendantcould not rely on a pass-on theory to avoid\ndamages,Illinois Brickaddressed whether an antitrustplaintiffcould rely on a pass-on theory to recover damages.\nThe State of Illinois had sued several manufacturers of concrete\nblocks, alleging that the defendants\u2019 price-fixing conspiracy had\nenabled them to overcharge building contractors, who in turn had\npassed on those charges to their customers, including the State.\nRecognizing thatHanover Shoehad already prohibited\nantitrust violators from using a \u201cpass-on theory\u201d defensively, the\nCourt declined to \u201cpermit offensive use of a pass-on theory against\nan alleged violator that could not use the same theory as a\ndefense.\u201d 431 U.\u00a0S., at 735. \u201cPermitting the use of pass-on\ntheories under \u00a74,\u201d the Court reasoned, would require determining\nhow much of the manufacturer\u2019s monopoly rent was absorbed by\nintermediary building contractors and how much they were able and\nchose to pass on to their customers like the State.Id., at\n737. Allowing pass-on theories would, as well, allow \u201cplaintiffs at\neach level in the distribution chain\u201d to \u201cassert conflicting claims\nto a common fund,\u201d which would require \u201cmassive efforts to\napportion the recovery among all potential plaintiffs that could\nhave absorbed part of the overcharge\u2014from direct purchasers to\nmiddlemen to ultimate consumers.\u201dIbid.Better again, the\nCourt decided, to adhere to traditional rules of proximate\ncausation and allow only the first affected customers\u2014the building\ncontractors\u2014to sue for the monopoly rents they had directly\npaid.There is nothing surprising in any of this.\nUnless Congress provides otherwise, this Court generally reads\nstatutory causes of action as \u201climited to plaintiffs whose injuries\nare proximately caused by violations of the statute.\u201dLexmark\nInt\u2019l, Inc.v.Static Control Components, Inc., 572 U.S.\n118, 132 (2014). That proximate cause requirement typically bars\nsuits for injuries that are \u201cderivative of misfortunes visited upon\na third person by the defendant\u2019s acts.\u201dId., at 133\n(internal quotation marks omitted). So, for example, if a\ndefendant\u2019s false advertising causes harm to one of its\ncompetitors, the competitor can sue the false advertiser under the\nLanham Act. But if the competitor is unable to pay its rent as a\nresult, the competitor\u2019s landlord can\u2019t sue the false advertiser,\nbecause the landlord\u2019s harm derives from the harm to the\ncompetitor.Id., at 134; see also,e.g.,Bank of\nAmerica Corp.v.Miami, 581 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___\u2013___\n(2017) (slip op., at 10\u201311);Dura Pharmaceuticals, Inc.v.Broudo,544 U.S.\n336, 346 (2005);Holmesv.Securities Investor\nProtection Corporation,503 U.S.\n258, 268\u2013270 (1992). This Court has long understoodIllinois\nBrickas simply applying these traditional proximate cause\nprinciples in the antitrust context. SeeAssociated Gen.\nContractors, 459 U. S., at 532\u2013535, 544\u2013545.[1]IIThe lawsuit before us depends on just the sort\nof pass-on theory thatIllinois Brickforbids. The\nplaintiffs bought apps from third-party app developers (or\nmanufacturers) in Apple\u2019s retail Internet App Store, at prices set\nby the developers. The lawsuit alleges that Apple is a monopolist\nretailer and that the 30% commission it charges developers for the\nright to sell through its platform represents an anticompetitive\nprice. The problem is that the 30% commission falls initially on\nthe developers. So if the commission is in fact a monopolistic\novercharge, thedevelopersare the parties who are directly\ninjured by it. Plaintiffs can be injuredonlyif the\ndevelopers are able and choose to pass on the overcharge to them in\nthe form of higher app prices that the developers alone control.\nPlaintiffs admitted as much in the district court, where they\ndescribed their theory of injury this way: \u201c[I]f Apple tells the\ndeveloper .\u00a0.\u00a0. we\u2019re going to take this 30 percent\ncommission .\u00a0.\u00a0. what\u2019s the developer going to do? The\ndeveloper is going to increase its price to cover Apple\u2019s\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. demanded profit.\u201d App. 143.Because this isexactlythe kind of\n\u201cpass-on theory\u201dIllinois Brickrejected, it should come as\nno surprise that the concerns animating that decision are also\nimplicated. Like other pass-on theories, plaintiffs\u2019 theory will\nnecessitate a complex inquiry into how Apple\u2019s conduct affected\nthird-party pricing decisions. And it will raise difficult\nquestions about apportionment of damages between app developers and\ntheir customers, along with the risk of duplicative damages awards.\nIf anything, plaintiffs\u2019 claims present these difficulties even\nmore starkly than did the claims at issue inIllinois\nBrick.Consider first the question of causation. To\ndetermine if Apple\u2019s conduct damaged plaintiffs at all (and if so,\nthe magnitude of their damages), a court will first have to explore\nwhether and to what extent each individual app developer was\nable\u2014and then opted\u2014to pass on the 30% commission to its consumers\nin the form of higher app prices. Sorting this out, if it can be\ndone at all, will entail wrestling with \u201c\u00a0\u2018complicated\ntheories\u2019\u00a0\u201d about \u201chow the relevant market variables would\nhave behaved had there been no overcharge.\u201dIllinois Brick,\n431 U.\u00a0S., at 741\u2013743. Will the court hear testimony to\ndetermine the market power of each app developer, how each set its\nprices, and what it might have charged consumers for apps if\nApple\u2019s commission had been lower? Will the court also consider\nexpert testimony analyzing how market factors might have influenced\ndevelopers\u2019 capacity and willingness to pass on Apple\u2019s alleged\nmonopoly overcharge? And will the court then somehow extrapolate\nits findings to all of the tens of thousands of developers who sold\napps through the App Store at different prices and times over the\ncourse of years?This causation inquiry will be complicated\nfurther by Apple\u2019s requirement that all app prices end in $0.99. As\nplaintiffs acknowledge, this rule has caused prices for the \u201cvast\nmajority\u201d of apps to \u201ccluster\u201d at exactly $0.99. Brief for\nRespondents 44. And a developer charging $0.99 for its app can\u2019t\nraise its price by just enough to recover the 30-cent commission.\nInstead, if the developer wants to pass on the commission to\nconsumers, it has to more than double its price to $1.99 (doubling\nthe commission in the process), which could significantly affect\nits sales. In short, because Apple\u2019s 99-cent rule creates a strong\ndisincentive for developers to raise their prices, it makes\nplaintiffs\u2019 pass-on theory of injury even harder to prove. Yet the\ncourt will have to consider all of this when determining what\ndamages, if any, plaintiffs suffered as a result of Apple\u2019s\nallegedly excessive 30% commission.[2]Plaintiffs\u2019 claims will also necessitate\n\u201cmassive efforts to apportion the recovery among all potential\nplaintiffs that could have absorbed part of the overcharge,\u201d\nincluding both consumers and app developers.Illinois Brick,\n431 U.\u00a0S., at 737. If, as plaintiffs contend, Apple\u2019s 30%\ncommission is a monopolistic overcharge, then the app developers\nhave a claim against Apple to recover whatever portion of the\ncommission they did not pass on to consumers. Before today,Hanover Shoewould have prevented Apple from reducing its\nliability to the developers by arguing that they had passed on the\novercharge to consumers. But the Court\u2019s holding thatIllinois\nBrickdoesn\u2019t govern this situation surely must meanHanover\nShoedoesn\u2019t either. So courts will have to divvy up the\ncommissions Apple collected between the developers and the\nconsumers. To do that, they\u2019ll have to figure out which party bore\nwhat portion of the overcharge in every purchase. And if the\ndevelopers bring suit separately from the consumers, Apple might be\nat risk of duplicative damages awards totaling more than the full\namount it col- lected in commissions. To avoid that possibility, it\nmay turn out that the developers are necessary parties who will\nhave to be joined in the plaintiffs\u2019 lawsuit. See Fed. Rule Civ.\nProc.\u00a019(a)(1)(B);Illinois Brick, 431 U.\u00a0S., at\n739 (explaining that \u201c[t]hese absent potential claimants would seem\nto fit the classic definition of \u2018necessary parties,\u2019 for purposes\nof compulsory joinder\u201d).[3]IIIThe United States and its antitrust regulators\nagree with all of this, so how does the Court reach such a\ndifferent conclusion? Seizing onIllinois Brick\u2019s use of the\nshorthand phrase \u201cdirect purchasers\u201d to describe the parties\nimmediately injured by the monopoly overcharge in that case, the\nCourt (re)characterizesIllinois Brickas a rule that anyone\nwho purchases goods directly from an alleged antitrust violator can\nsue, while anyone who doesn\u2019t, can\u2019t. Under this revisionist\nversion ofIllinois Brick, the dispositive question becomes\nwhether an \u201cintermediary in the distribution chain\u201d stands between\nthe plaintiff and the defendant.Ante, at 6. And because the\nplaintiff app purchasers in this case happen to have purchased apps\ndirectly from Apple, the Court reasons, they may sue.This exalts form over substance. Instead of\nfocusing on the traditional proximate cause question where the\nalleged overcharge is first (and thus surely) felt, the Court\u2019s\ntest turns on who happens to be in privity of contract with whom.\nBut we\u2019ve long recognized that antitrust law should look at \u201cthe\neconomic reality of the relevant transactions\u201d rather than \u201cformal\nconceptions of contract law.\u201dUnited Statesv.Concentrated Phosphate Export Assn., Inc.,393 U.S.\n199, 208 (1968). And this case illustrates why. To evade the\nCourt\u2019s test, all Apple must do is amend its contracts. Instead of\ncollecting payments for apps sold in the App Store and remitting\nthe balance (less its commission) to developers, Apple can simply\nspecify that consumers\u2019 payments will flow the other way: directly\nto the developers, who will then remit commissions to Apple. No\nantitrust reason exists to treat these contractual arrangements\ndifferently, and doing so will only induce firms to abandon their\npreferred\u2014and presumably more efficient\u2014distribution arrangements\nin favor of less efficient ones, all so they might avoid an\narbitrary legal rule. SeeCopperweld Corp.v.Independence Tube Corp.,467 U.S.\n752, 763, 772\u2013774 (1984) (rejecting an \u201c\u00a0\u2018artificial\ndistinction\u2019\u00a0\u201d that \u201cserves no valid antitrust goals but\nmerely deprives consumers and producers of the benefits\u201d of a\nparticular business model).Nor doesIllinois Brickcome close to\nendorsing such a blind formalism. Yes, as the Court notes, the\nplaintiff inIllinois Brickdid contract directly with an\nintermediary rather than with the putative antitrust violator. ButIllinois Brick\u2019s rejection of pass-on claims, and its\nexplanation of the difficulties those claims present, had nothing\nto do with privity of contract. Instead and as we have seen, its\nrule and reasoning grew from the \u201cgeneral tendency of the law\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. not to go beyond\u201d the party that first felt the\nsting of the alleged overcharge, and from the complications that\ncan arise when courts attempt to discern whether and to what degree\ndamages were passed on to others.Supra, at 2\u20133. The Court\ntoday risks replacing a cogent rule about proximate cause with a\npointless and easily evaded imposter. We do not usually read our\nown precedents so uncharitably.Maybe the Court proceeds as it does today\nbecause it just disagrees withIllinois Brick. After all,\nthe Court not only displaces a sensible rule in favor of a\nsenseless one; it also proceeds to question each ofIllinois\nBrick\u2019s rationales\u2014doubting that those directly injured are\nalways the best plaintiffs to bring suit, that calculating damages\nfor pass-on plaintiffs will often be unduly complicated, and that\nconflicting claims to a common fund justify limiting who may sue.Ante, at 11\u201313. The Court even tells us that any \u201cambiguity\u201d\nabout the permissibility of pass-on damages should be resolved \u201cin\nthe direction of the statutory text,\u201dante, at 8\u2014ignoring\nthatIllinois Brickfollowed the well-trodden path of\nconstruing the statutory text in light of background common law\nprinciples of proximate cause. Last but not least, the Court\nsuggests that the traditional understanding ofIllinois\nBrickleads to \u201carbitrary and unprincipled\u201d results.Ante, at 8. It asks us to consider two hypothetical\nscenarios that, it says, prove the point. The first is a \u201cmarkup\u201d\nscenario in which a monopolistic retailer buys a product from a\nmanufacturer for $6 and then decides to sell the product to a\nconsumer for $10, applying a supracompetitive $4 markup. The second\nis a \u201ccommission\u201d scenario in which a manufacturer directs a\nmonopolistic retailer to sell the manufacturer\u2019s product to a\nconsumer for $10 and the retailer keeps a supracompetitive 40%\ncommission, sending $6 back to the manufac- turer. The two\nscenarios are economically the same, the Court asserts, and\nforbidding recovery in the second for lack of proximate cause makes\nno sense.But there is nothing arbitrary or unprincipled\naboutIllinois Brick\u2019s rule or results. The notion that the\ncausal chain must stop somewhere is an ancient and venerable one.\nAs with most any rule of proximate cause, reasonable people can\ndebate whetherIllinois Brickdrew exactly the right line in\ncutting off claims where it did. But the line it drew is\nintelligible, principled, administrable, and far more reasonable\nthan the Court\u2019s artificial rule of contractual privity. Nor do the\nCourt\u2019s hypotheticals come close to proving otherwise. In the first\nscenario, the markup falls initially on the consumer, so there\u2019s no\ndoubt that the retailer\u2019s anticompetitive conduct proximately\ncaused the consumer\u2019s injury. Meanwhile, in the second scenario the\ncommission falls initially on the manufacturer, and the consumer\nwon\u2019t feel the pain unless the manufacturer can and does recoup\nsome or all of the elevated commission by raising its own prices.\nInthatsituation, the manufacturer is the directly injured\nparty, and the difficulty of disaggregating damages between those\ndirectly and indirectly harmed means that the consumer can\u2019t\nestablish proximate cause under traditional principles.Someamicishare the Court\u2019s skepticism\nofIllinois Brick. They even urge us to overruleIllinois\nBrick, assuring us that \u201cmodern economic techniques\u201d can now\nmitigate any problems that arise in allocating damages between\nthose who suffer them directly and those who suffer them\nindirectly. Brief for State of Texas et al. asAmici Curiae25. Maybe there is something to these arguments; maybe not. But\nthere\u2019s plenty of reason to decline any invitation to take even a\nsmall step away fromIllinois Bricktoday. The plaintiffs\nhave not asked us to overrule our precedent\u2014in fact, they\u2019ve\ndisavowed any such request. Tr. of Oral Arg. 40. So we lack the\nbenefit of the adversarial process in a complex area involving a\n40-year-old precedent and many hard questions. For example, if we\nare really inclined to overruleIllinois Brick, doesn\u2019t that\nmean we must do the same toHanover Shoe? If the proximate\ncause line is no longer to be drawn at the first injured party, how\nfar down the causal chain can a plaintiff be and still recoup\ndamages? Must all potential claimants to the single monopoly rent\nbe gathered in a single lawsuit as necessary parties (and if not,\nwhy not)? Without any invitation or reason to revisit our\nprecedent, and with so many grounds for caution, I would have\nthought the proper course today would have been to affordIllinois Brickfull effect, not to begin whittling it away\nto a bare formalism. I respectfully dissent.Notes1For this reason, it\u2019s\nhard to make sense of the suggestion thatIllinois Brickmay\nnot apply to claims for injunctive relief,ante, at 5,\nn.\u00a01. Under our normal rule of construction, a plaintiff who\u2019s\nnot proximately harmed by a defendant\u2019s unlawful conduct has no\ncause of action to sue the defendant for any type of relief.Lexmark Int\u2019l, Inc.v.Static Control Components,\nInc., 572 U.S. 118, 135 (2014) (although a plaintiff that\n\u201ccannot quantify its losses with sufficient certainty to recover\ndamages .\u00a0.\u00a0. may still be entitled to injunctive\nrelief,\u201d the requirement of proximate causation \u201cmust be met in\nevery case\u201d).2Plaintiffs haven\u2019t argued\n(and so have forfeited in this Court any argument) that Apple\u2019s\nimposition of the 99-cent rule wasitselfan antitrust\nviolation that injured consumers by raising the price of apps above\ncompetitive levels. They didn\u2019t mention the 99-cent rule in their\ncomplaint in district court or in their briefs to the court of\nappeals. And, as I\u2019ve noted, they concede that they are seeking\ndamages \u201cbased solely on\u201d the 30% commission. Brief in Opposition\n5.3The Court denies that\nallowing both consumers and developers to sue over the same\nallegedly unlawful commission will \u201cresult in \u2018conflicting claims\nto a common fund\u2019\u00a0\u201d asIllinois Brickfeared.Ante, at 12. But Apple charged only one commission on each\nsale. So even assuming for argument\u2019s sake that the 30% commission\nwas entirely illegal, Apple can only be required to pay out in\ndamages, at most, the full amount it received in commissions. To\ntheir credit, even plaintiffs have conceded as much, acknowledging\nthat because \u201cthere is onlyone 30% markup,\u201d any claim by\nthe developers against Apple would necessarily be seeking \u201ca piece\nof the same 30% pie.\u201d Brief in Opposition 12. It\u2019s a mystery why\nthe Court refuses to accept that sensible concession.",
