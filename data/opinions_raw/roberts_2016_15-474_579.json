McDONNELL, PETITIONERv.UNITED STATESon writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the fourth circuit[June 27, 2016]Chief Justice Roberts delivered the opinion of\nthe Court.In 2014, the Federal Government indicted former\nVirginia Governor Robert McDonnell and his wife, Maureen McDonnell,\non bribery charges. The charges related to the acceptance by the\nMcDonnells of $175,000 in loans, gifts, and other benefits from\nVirginia businessman Jonnie Williams, while Governor McDonnell was\nin office. Williams was the chief executive officer of Star\nScientific, a Virginia-based company that had developed a\nnutritional supplement made from anatabine, a compound found in\ntobacco. Star Scientific hoped that Virginia\u2019s public universities\nwould perform research studies on anatabine, and Williams wanted\nGovernor McDonnell\u2019s assistance in obtaining those studies.To convict the McDonnells of bribery, the\nGovernment was required to show that Governor McDonnell committed\n(or agreed to commit) an \u201cofficial act\u201d in exchange for the loans\nand gifts. The parties did not agree, however, on what counts as an\n\u201cofficial act.\u201d The Government alleged in the indictment, and\nmaintains on appeal, that Governor McDonnell committed at least\nfive \u201cofficial acts.\u201d Those acts included \u201carranging meetings\u201d for\nWilliams with other Virginia officials to discuss Star Scientific\u2019s\nproduct, \u201chosting\u201d events for Star Scientific at the Governor\u2019s\nMansion, and \u201ccontacting other government officials\u201d concerning\nstudies of anatabine. Supp. App. 47\u201348. The Government also argued\nmore broadly that these activities constituted \u201cofficial action\u201d\nbecause they related to Vir-ginia business development, a priority\nof Governor Mc-Donnell\u2019s administration. Governor McDonnell\ncontends that merely setting up a meeting, hosting an event, or\ncontacting an official\u2014without more\u2014does not count as an \u201cofficial\nact.\u201dAt trial, the District Court instructed the jury\naccording to the Government\u2019s broad understanding of what\nconstitutes an \u201cofficial act,\u201d and the jury convicted both Governor\nand Mrs. McDonnell on the bribery charges. The Fourth Circuit\naffirmed Governor McDonnell\u2019s conviction, and we granted review to\nclarify the meaning of \u201cofficial act.\u201dIAOn November 3, 2009, petitioner Robert\nMcDonnell was elected the 71st Governor of Virginia. His campaign\nslogan was \u201cBob\u2019s for Jobs,\u201d and his focus in office was on\npromoting business in Virginia. As Governor, McDonnell spoke about\neconomic development in Virginia \u201con a daily basis\u201d and attended\nnumerous \u201cevents, ribbon cuttings,\u201d and \u201cplant facility openings.\u201d\nApp. 4093, 5241. He also referred thousands of constituents to\nmeetings with members of his staff and other government officials.\nAccording to longtime staffers, Governor McDonnell likely had more\nevents at the Virginia Governor\u2019s Mansion to promote Virginia\nbusiness than had occurred in \u201cany other administration.\u201dId., at 4093.This case concerns Governor McDonnell\u2019s\ninteractions with one of his constituents, Virginia businessman\nJonnie Williams. Williams was the CEO of Star Scientific, a\nVirginia-based company that developed and marketed Anatabloc, a\nnutritional supplement made from anatabine, a compound found in\ntobacco. Star Scientific hoped to obtain Food and Drug\nAdministration approval of Anatabloc as an anti-inflammatory drug.\nAn important step in securing that approval was initiating\nindependent research studies on the health benefits of anatabine.\nStar Scientific hoped Virginia\u2019s public universities would\nundertake such studies, pursuant to a grant from Virginia\u2019s Tobacco\nCommission.Governor McDonnell first met Williams in 2009,\nwhen Williams offered McDonnell transportation on his private\nairplane to assist with McDonnell\u2019s election campaign. Shortly\nafter the election, Williams had dinner with Governor and Mrs.\nMcDonnell at a restaurant in New York. The conversation turned to\nMrs. McDonnell\u2019s search for a dress for the inauguration, which led\nWilliams to offer to purchase a gown for her. Governor McDonnell\u2019s\ncounsel later instructed Williams not to buy the dress, and Mrs.\nMcDonnell told Williams that she would take a rain check.Id., at 2203\u20132209.In October 2010, Governor McDonnell and Williams\nmet again on Williams\u2019s plane. During the flight, Williams told\nGovernor McDonnell that he \u201cneeded his help\u201d moving forward on the\nresearch studies at Virginia\u2019s public universities, and he asked to\nbe introduced to the person that he \u201cneeded to talk to.\u201dId., at 2210\u20132211. Governor McDonnell agreed to introduce\nWilliams to Dr. William Hazel, Virginia\u2019s Secretary of Health and\nHuman Resources. Williams met with Dr. Hazel the following month,\nbut the meeting was unfruitful; Dr. Hazel was skeptical of the\nscience behind Anatabloc and did not assist Williams in obtaining\nthe studies.Id., at 2211\u20132217, 3738\u20133749.Six months later, Governor McDonnell\u2019s wife,\nMaureen McDonnell, offered to seat Williams next to the Governor at\na political rally. Shortly before the event, Williams took Mrs.\nMcDonnell on a shopping trip and bought her $20,000 worth of\ndesigner clothing. The McDonnells later had Williams over for\ndinner at the Governor\u2019s Mansion, where they discussed research\nstudies on Anatabloc.Id., at 6560.Two days after that dinner, Williams had an\narticle about Star Scientific\u2019s research e-mailed to Mrs.\nMcDonnell, which she forwarded to her husband. Less than an hour\nlater, Governor McDonnell texted his sister to discuss the\nfinancial situation of certain rental properties they owned in\nVirginia Beach. Governor McDonnell also e-mailed his daughter to\nask about expenses for her upcoming wedding.The next day, Williams returned to the\nGovernor\u2019s Mansion for a meeting with Mrs. McDonnell. At the\nmeeting, Mrs. McDonnell described the family\u2019s financial problems,\nincluding their struggling rental properties in Virginia Beach and\ntheir daughter\u2019s wedding expenses. Mrs. McDonnell, who had\nexperience selling nutritional supplements, told Williams that she\nhad a background in the area and could help him with Anatabloc.\nAccording to Williams, she explained that the \u201cGovernor says it\u2019s\nokay for me to help you and\u2014but I need you to help me. I need you\nto help me with this financial situation.\u201dId.,at 2231.\nMrs. McDonnell then asked Williams for a $50,000 loan, in addition\nto a $15,000 gift to help pay for her daughter\u2019s wedding, and\nWilliams agreed.Williams testified that he called Governor\nMcDonnell after the meeting and said, \u201cI understand the financial\nproblems and I\u2019m willing to help. I just wanted to make sure that\nyou knew about this.\u201dId.,at 2233. According to Williams,\nGovernor McDonnell thanked him for his help.Ibid.Governor\nMcDonnell testified, in contrast, that he did not know about the\nloan at the time, and that when he learned of it he was upset that\nMrs. McDonnell had requested the loan from Williams.Id.,at\n6095\u20136096. Three days after the meeting between Williams and Mrs.\nMcDonnell, Governor McDonnell directed his assistant to forward the\narticle on Star Scientific to Dr. Hazel.In June 2011, Williams sent Mrs. McDonnell\u2019s\nchief of staff a letter containing a proposed research protocol for\nthe Anatabloc studies. The letter was addressed to Governor\nMcDonnell, and it suggested that the Governor \u201cuse the attached\nprotocol to initiate the \u2018Virginia Study\u2019 of Anatabloc at the\nMedical College of Virginia and the University of Virginia School\nof Medicine.\u201dId.,at 2254. Governor McDonnell gave the\nletter to Dr. Hazel.Id.,at 6121\u20136122. Williams testified\nat trial that he did not \u201crecall any response\u201d to the letter.Id.,at 2256.In July 2011, the McDonnell family visited\nWilliams\u2019s vacation home for the weekend, and Governor McDonnell\nborrowed Williams\u2019s Ferrari while there. Shortly thereafter,\nGovernor McDonnell asked Dr. Hazel to send an aide to a meeting\nwith Williams and Mrs. McDonnell to discuss research studies on\nAnatabloc. The aide later testified that she did not feel pressured\nby Governor or Mrs. McDonnell to do \u201canything other than have the\nmeeting,\u201d and that Williams did not ask anything of her at the\nmeeting.Id., at 3075. After the meeting, the aide sent\nWilliams a \u201cpolite blow-off\u201d e-mail.Id., at 3081.At a subsequent meeting at the Governor\u2019s\nMansion, Mrs. McDonnell admired Williams\u2019s Rolex and mentioned that\nshe wanted to get one for Governor McDonnell. Williams asked if\nMrs. McDonnell wanted him to purchase a Rolex for the Governor, and\nMrs. McDonnell responded, \u201cYes, that would be nice.\u201dId., at\n2274. Williams did so, and Mrs. McDonnell later gave the Rolex to\nGovernor McDonnell as a Christmas present.In August 2011, the McDonnells hosted a lunch\nevent for Star Scientific at the Governor\u2019s Mansion. According to\nWilliams, the purpose of the event was to launch Anatabloc. Seeid., at 2278. According to Governor McDonnell\u2019s\ngubernatorial counsel, however, it was just lunch. Seeid.,\nat 3229\u20133231.The guest list for the event included\nresearchers at the University of Virginia and Virginia Commonwealth\nUniversity. During the event, Star Scientific distributed free\nsamples of Anatabloc, in addition to eight $25,000 checks that\nresearchers could use in preparing grant proposals for studying\nAnatabloc. Governor McDonnell asked researchers at the event\nwhether they thought \u201cthere was some scientific validity\u201d to\nAnatabloc and \u201cwhether or not there was any reason to explore this\nfurther.\u201dId., at 3344. He also asked whether this could \u201cbe\nsomething good for the Commonwealth, particularly as it relates to\neconomy or job creation.\u201dIbid.When Williams asked Governor\nMcDonnell whether he would support funding for the research\nstudies, Governor McDonnell \u201cvery politely\u201d replied, \u201cI have\nlimited decision-making power in this area.\u201dId., at\n3927.In January 2012, Mrs. McDonnell asked Williams\nfor an additional loan for the Virginia Beach rental properties,\nand Williams agreed. On February 3, Governor McDonnell followed up\non that conversation by calling Williams to discuss a $50,000\nloan.Several days later, Williams complained to Mrs.\nMcDonnell that the Virginia universities were not returning Star\nScientific\u2019s calls. She passed Williams\u2019s complaint on to the\nGovernor. While Mrs. McDonnell was driving with Governor McDonnell,\nshe also e-mailed Governor McDonnell\u2019s counsel, stating that the\nGovernor \u201cwants to know why nothing has developed\u201d with the\nresearch studies after Williams had provided the eight $25,000\nchecks for preparing grant proposals, and that the Governor \u201cwants\nto get this going\u201d at the universities.Id., at 3214, 4931.\nAccording to Governor McDonnell, how-ever, Mrs. McDonnell acted\nwithout his knowledge or per-mission, and he never made the\nstatements she attributed to him.Id.,at 6306\u20136308.On February 16, Governor McDonnell e-mailed\nWilliams to check on the status of documents related to the $50,000\nloan. A few minutes later, Governor McDonnell e-mailed his counsel\nstating, \u201cPlease see me about Anatabloc issues at VCU and UVA.\nThanks.\u201dId., at 3217. Governor McDonnell\u2019s counsel replied,\n\u201cWill do. We need to be careful with this issue.\u201dIbid.The\nnext day, Governor McDonnell\u2019s counsel called Star Scientific\u2019s\nlobbyist in order to \u201cchange the expectations\u201d of Star Scientific\nregarding the involvement of the Governor\u2019s Office in the studies.Id., at 3219.At the end of February, Governor McDonnell\nhosted a healthcare industry reception at the Governor\u2019s Mansion,\nwhich Williams attended. Mrs. McDonnell also invited a number of\nguests recommended by Williams, including researchers at the\nVirginia universities. Governor McDonnell was present, but did not\nmention Star Scientific, Williams, or Anatabloc during the event.Id., at 3671\u20133672. That same day, Governor McDonnell and\nWilliams spoke about the $50,000 loan, and Williams loaned the\nmoney to the McDonnells shortly thereafter.Id.,at 2306,\n2353.In March 2012, Governor McDonnell met with Lisa\nHicks-Thomas, the Virginia Secretary of Administration, and Sara\nWilson, the Director of the Virginia Department of Human Resource\nManagement. The purpose of the meeting was to discuss Virginia\u2019s\nhealth plan for state employees. At that time, Governor McDonnell\nwas taking Anatabloc several times a day. He took a pill during the\nmeeting, and told Hicks-Thomas and Wilson that the pills \u201cwere\nworking well for him\u201d and \u201cwould be good for\u201d state employees.Id., at 4227. Hicks-Thomas recalled Governor McDonnell\nasking them to meet with a representative from Star Scientific;\nWilson had no such recollection.Id., at 4219, 4227. After\nthe discussion with Governor McDonnell, Hicks-Thomas and Wilson\nlooked up Anatabloc on the Internet, but they did not set up a\nmeeting with Star Scientific or conduct any other follow-up.Id., at 4220, 4230. It is undisputed that Virginia\u2019s health\nplan for state employees does not cover nutritional supplements\nsuch as Anatabloc.In May 2012, Governor McDonnell requested an\nadditional $20,000 loan, which Williams provided. Throughout this\nperiod, Williams also paid for several rounds of golf for Governor\nMcDonnell and his children, took the McDonnells on a weekend trip,\nand gave $10,000 as a wedding gift to one of the McDonnells\u2019\ndaughters. In total, Williams gave the McDonnells over $175,000 in\ngifts and loans.BIn January 2014, Governor McDonnell was\nindicted for accepting payments, loans, gifts, and other things of\nvalue from Williams and Star Scientific in exchange for \u201cperforming\nofficial actions on an as-needed basis, as opportunities arose, to\nlegitimize, promote, and obtain research studies for Star\nScientific\u2019s products.\u201d Supp. App. 46. The charges against him\ncomprised one count of conspiracy to commit honest services fraud,\nthree counts of honest services fraud, one count of conspiracy to\ncommit Hobbs Act extortion, six counts of Hobbs Act extortion, and\ntwo counts of making a false statement. See 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7\u00a71343, 1349 (honest services fraud); \u00a71951(a) (Hobbs Act\nextortion); \u00a71014 (false statement). Mrs. McDonnell was indicted on\nsimilar charges, plus obstructing official proceedings, based on\nher alleged involvement in the scheme. See \u00a71512(c)(2)\n(obstruction).The theory underlying both the honest services\nfraud and Hobbs Act extortion charges was that Governor McDonnell\nhad accepted bribes from Williams. SeeSkillingv.United\nStates, 561 U.\u00a0S. 358, 404 (2010) (construing honest\nservices fraud to forbid \u201cfraudulent schemes to deprive another of\nhonest services through bribes or kickbacks\u201d);Evansv.United States, 504 U.\u00a0S. 255, 260, 269 (1992)\n(construing Hobbs Act extortion to include \u201c\u00a0\u2018taking a\nbribe\u2019\u00a0\u201d).The parties agreed that they would define honest\nservices fraud with reference to the federal bribery statute, 18\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7201. That statute makes it a crime for \u201ca\npublic official or person selected to be a public official,\ndirectly or indirectly, corruptly\u201d to demand, seek, receive,\naccept, or agree \u201cto receive or accept anything of value\u201d in return\nfor being \u201cinfluenced in the performance of any official act.\u201d\n\u00a7201(b)(2). An \u201cofficial act\u201d is defined as \u201cany decision or action\non any question, matter, cause, suit, proceeding or controversy,\nwhich may at any time be pending, or which may by law be brought\nbefore any public official, in such official\u2019s official capacity,\nor in such official\u2019s place of trust or profit.\u201d \u00a7201(a)(3).The parties also agreed that obtaining a \u201cthing\nof value .\u00a0.\u00a0. knowing that the thing of value was given\nin return for official action\u201d was an element of Hobbs Act\nextortion, and that they would use the definition of \u201cofficial act\u201d\nfound in the federal bribery statute to define \u201cofficial action\u201d\nunder the Hobbs Act. 792 F.\u00a03d 478, 505 (CA4 2015) (internal\nquotation marks omitted).As a result of all this, the Government was\nrequired to prove that Governor McDonnell committed or agreed to\ncommit an \u201cofficial act\u201d in exchange for the loans and gifts from\nWilliams. SeeEvans, 504 U.\u00a0S., at 268 (\u201cthe offense is\ncompleted at the time when the public official receives a payment\nin return for his agreement to perform specific official acts;\nfulfillment of thequid pro quois not an element of the\noffense\u201d).The Government alleged that Governor McDonnell\nhad committed at least five \u201cofficial acts\u201d:(1) \u201carranging meetings for [Williams] with\nVirginia government officials, who were subordinates of the\nGovernor, to discuss and promote Anatabloc\u201d;(2) \u201chosting, and .\u00a0.\u00a0. attending,\nevents at the Governor\u2019s Mansion designed to encourage Virginia\nuniversity researchers to initiate studies of anatabine and to\npromote Star Scientific\u2019s products to doctors for referral to their\npatients\u201d;(3) \u201ccontacting other government officials in\nthe [Governor\u2019s Office] as part of an effort to encourage Vir-ginia\nstate research universities to initiate studies of anatabine\u201d;(4) \u201cpromoting Star Scientific\u2019s products and\nfacilitating its relationships with Virginia government officials\nby allowing [Williams] to invite individuals important to Star\nScientific\u2019s business to exclusive events at the Governor\u2019s\nMansion\u201d; and(5) \u201crecommending that senior government\nofficials in the [Governor\u2019s Office] meet with Star Scientific\nexecutives to discuss ways that the company\u2019s products could lower\nhealthcare costs.\u201d Supp. App. 47\u201348(indictment).The case proceeded to a jury trial, which lasted\nfive weeks. Pursuant to an immunity agreement, Williams testified\nthat he had given the gifts and loans to the McDonnells to obtain\nthe Governor\u2019s \u201chelp with the testing\u201d of Anatabloc at Virginia\u2019s\nmedical schools. App. 2234. Governor McDonnell acknowledged that he\nhad requested loans and accepted gifts from Williams. He testified,\nhowever, that setting up meetings with government officials was\nsomething he did \u201cliterally thousands of times\u201d as Governor, and\nthat he did not expect his staff \u201cto do anything other than to\nmeet\u201d with Williams.Id., at 6042.Several state officials testified that they had\ndiscussed Anatabloc with Williams or Governor McDonnell, but had\nnot taken any action to further the research studies.Id.,\nat 3739\u20133750 (Dr. Hazel), 3075\u20133077 (aide to Dr. Hazel), 4218\u20134220\n(Sara Wilson), 4230\u20134231 (Lisa Hicks-Thomas). A UVA employee in the\nuniversity research office, who had never spoken with the Governor\nabout Anatabloc, testified that she wrote a pro/con list concerning\nresearch studies on Anatabloc. The first \u201cpro\u201d was the\n\u201c[p]erception to Governor that UVA would like to work with local\ncompanies,\u201d and the first \u201ccon\u201d was the \u201c[p]olitical pressure from\nGovernor and impact on future UVA requests from the Governor.\u201dId., at 4321, 4323 (Sharon Krueger).Following closing arguments, the District Court\ninstructed the jury that to convict Governor McDonnell it must find\nthat he agreed \u201cto accept a thing of value in exchange for official\naction.\u201d Supp. App. 68. The court described the five alleged\n\u201cofficial acts\u201d set forth in the indictment, which involved\narranging meetings, hosting events, and contacting other government\nofficials. The court then quoted the statutory definition of\n\u201cofficial act,\u201d and\u2014as the Government had requested\u2014advised the\njury that the term encompassed \u201cacts that a public official\ncustomarily performs,\u201d including acts \u201cin furtherance of\nlonger-term goals\u201d or \u201cin a series of steps to exercise influence\nor achieve an end.\u201dId., at 69\u201370.Governor McDonnell had requested the court to\nfurther instruct the jury that the \u201cfact that an activity is a\nroutine activity, or a \u2018settled practice,\u2019 of an office-holder does\nnot alone make it an \u2018official act,\u2019 \u201d and that \u201cmerely arranging a\nmeeting, attending an event, hosting a reception, or making a\nspeech are not, standing alone, \u2018official acts,\u2019 even if they are\nsettled practices of the official,\u201d because they \u201care not decisions\non matters pending before the government.\u201d 792 F.\u00a03d, at 513\n(internal quotation marks omitted). He also asked the court to\nexplain to the jury that an \u201cofficial act\u201d must intend to or \u201cin\nfact influence a specific official decision the government actually\nmakes\u2014such as awarding a contract, hiring a government em-ployee,\nissuing a license, passing a law, or implementing a regulation.\u201d\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 147a. The District Court declined to give\nGovernor McDonnell\u2019s proposed instruction to the jury.The jury convicted Governor McDonnell on the\nhonest services fraud and Hobbs Act extortion charges, but\nacquitted him on the false statement charges. Mrs. McDonnell was\nalso convicted on most of the charges against her. Although the\nGovernment requested a sentence of at least ten years for Governor\nMcDonnell, the District Court sentenced him to two years in prison.\nMrs. McDonnell received a one-year sentence.Following the verdict, Governor McDonnell moved\nto vacate his convictions on the ground that the jury instructions\n\u201cwere legally erroneous because they (i) allowed the jury to\nconvict [him] on an erroneous understanding of \u2018official act,\u2019 and\n(ii) allowed a conviction on the theory that [he] accepted things\nof value that were given for future unspecified action.\u201d 64\nF.\u00a0Supp. 3d 783, 787 (ED Va. 2014). The District Court denied\nthe motion.Id.,at 802. In addition, Governor McDonnell\nmoved for acquittal on the basis that there was insufficient\nevidence to convict him, and that the Hobbs Act and honest services\nstatute were unconstitutionally vague. Crim. No. 3:14\u2013CR\u201312 (ED\nVa., Dec. 1, 2014), Supp. App. 80, 82\u201392. That motion was also\ndenied. Seeid.,at 92\u201394. (He also raised other challenges\nto his convictions, which are not at issue here.)Governor McDonnell appealed his convictions to\nthe Fourth Circuit, challenging the definition of \u201cofficial action\u201d\nin the jury instructions on the ground that it deemed \u201cvirtually\nall of a public servant\u2019s activities \u2018official,\u2019 no matter how\nminor or innocuous.\u201d 792 F.\u00a03d, at 506. He also reiterated his\nchallenges to the sufficiency of the evidence and the\nconstitutionality of the statutes under which he was convicted.Id., at 509, n.\u00a019, 515.The Fourth Circuit affirmed, and we granted\ncertiorari. 577 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2016). Mrs. McDonnell\u2019s separate\nappeal remains pending before the Court of Appeals.IIThe issue in this case is the proper\ninterpretation of the term \u201cofficial act.\u201d Section 201(a)(3)\ndefines an \u201cofficial act\u201d as \u201cany decision or action on any\nquestion, matter, cause, suit, proceeding or controversy, which may\nat any time be pending, or which may by law be brought before any\npublic official, in such official\u2019s official capacity, or in such\nofficial\u2019s place of trust or profit.\u201dAccording to the Government, \u201cCongress used\nintentionally broad language\u201d in \u00a7201(a)(3) to embrace \u201canydecision or action, onanyquestion or matter, that may atany timebe pending, or which may by law be brought beforeanypublic official, in such official\u2019s official capac-ity.\u201d\nBrief for United States 20\u201321 (Government\u2019s emphasis; alteration\nand internal quotation marks omitted). The Government concludes\nthat the term \u201cofficial act\u201d therefore encompasses nearly any\nactivity by a public official. In the Government\u2019s view, \u201cofficial\nact\u201d specifically includes arranging a meeting, contacting another\npublic official, or hosting an event\u2014without more\u2014concerning any\nsubject, including a broad policy issue such as Vir-ginia economic\ndevelopment.Id.,at 47\u201349; Tr. of Oral Arg. 28\u201330.Governor McDonnell, in contrast, contends that\nstatu-tory context compels a more circumscribed reading, limiting\n\u201cofficial acts\u201d to those acts that \u201cdirect[\u00a0] a particular\nresolution of a specific governmental decision,\u201d or that pressure\nanother official to do so. Brief for Petitioner 44, 51. He also\nclaims that \u201cvague corruption laws\u201d such as \u00a7201 implicate serious\nconstitutional concerns, militating \u201cin favor of a narrow, cautious\nreading of these criminal statutes.\u201dId.,at 21.Taking into account the text of the statute, the\nprecedent of this Court, and the constitutional concerns raised by\nGovernor McDonnell, we reject the Government\u2019s reading of\n\u00a7201(a)(3) and adopt a more bounded interpretation of \u201cofficial\nact.\u201d Under that interpretation, setting up a meeting, calling\nanother public official, or hosting an event does not, standing\nalone, qualify as an \u201cofficial act.\u201dAThe text of \u00a7201(a)(3) sets forth two\nrequirements for an \u201cofficial act\u201d: First, the Government must\nidentify a \u201cquestion, matter, cause, suit, proceeding or\ncontroversy\u201d that \u201cmay at any time be pending\u201d or \u201cmay by law be\nbrought\u201d before a public official. Second, the Government must\nprove that the public official made a decision or took an action\n\u201con\u201d that question, matter, cause, suit, proceeding, or\ncontroversy, or agreed to do so. The issue here is whether\narranging a meeting, contacting another official, or hosting an\nevent\u2014without more\u2014can be a \u201cquestion, matter, cause, suit,\nproceeding or controversy,\u201d and if not, whether it can be a\ndecision or action on a \u201cquestion, matter, cause, suit, proceeding\nor controversy.\u201dThe first inquiry is whether a typical meeting,\ncall, or event is itself a \u201cquestion, matter, cause, suit,\nproceeding or controversy.\u201d The Government argues that nearly any\nactivity by a public official qualifies as a question or\nmatter\u2014from workaday functions, such as the typical call, meeting,\nor event, to the broadest issues the government confronts, such as\nfostering economic development. We conclude, however, that the\nterms \u201cquestion, matter, cause, suit, proceeding or controversy\u201d do\nnot sweep so broadly.The last four words in that list\u2014\u201ccause,\u201d\n\u201csuit,\u201d \u201cproceeding,\u201d and \u201ccontroversy\u201d\u2014connote a formal exercise\nof governmental power, such as a lawsuit, hearing, or\nadministrative determination. See,e.g.,Crimes Act of 1790,\n\u00a721, 1Stat. 117 (using \u201ccause,\u201d \u201csuit,\u201d and \u201ccontroversy\u201d in a\nrelated statutory context to refer to judicial proceedings);\nBlack\u2019s Law Dictionary 278\u2013279, 400, 1602\u20131603 (4th ed. 1951)\n(defining \u201ccause,\u201d \u201csuit,\u201d and \u201ccontroversy\u201d as judicial\nproceedings); 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7201(b)(3) (using \u201cproceeding\u201d\nto refer to trials, hearings, or the like \u201cbefore any court, any\ncommittee of either House or both Houses of Congress, or any\nagency, commission, or officer\u201d). Al-though it may be difficult to\ndefine the precise reach of those terms, it seems clear that a\ntypical meeting, telephone call, or event arranged by a public\nofficial does not qualify as a \u201ccause, suit, proceeding or\ncontroversy.\u201dBut what about a \u201cquestion\u201d or \u201cmatter\u201d? A\n\u201cquestion\u201d could mean any \u201csubject or aspect that is in dispute,\nopen for discussion, or to be inquired into,\u201d and a \u201cmatter\u201d any\n\u201csubject\u201d of \u201cinterest or relevance.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New\nInternational Dictionary 1394, 1863 (1961). If those meanings were\nadopted, a typical meeting, call, or event would qualify as a\n\u201cquestion\u201d or \u201cmatter.\u201d A \u201cquestion\u201d may also be interpreted more\nnarrowly, however, as \u201ca subject or point of debate or a\nproposition being or to be voted on in a meeting,\u201d such as a\nquestion \u201cbefore the senate.\u201dId.,at 1863. Similarly, a\n\u201cmatter\u201d may be limited to \u201ca topic under active and usually\nserious or practical consideration,\u201d such as a matter that \u201cwill\ncome before the committee.\u201dId.,at 1394.To choose between those competing definitions,\nwe look to the context in which the words appear. Under the\nfamiliar interpretive canonnoscitur a sociis, \u201ca word is\nknown by the company it keeps.\u201dJareckiv.G.\u00a0D.\nSearle & Co., 367 U.\u00a0S. 303, 307 (1961) . While \u201cnot\nan inescapable rule,\u201d this canon \u201cis often wisely applied where a\nword is capable of many meanings in order to avoid the giving of\nunintended breadth to the Acts of Congress.\u201dIbid.For\nexample, inGustafsonv.Alloyd Co., 513 U.\u00a0S.\n561 (1995) , a statute defined the word \u201cprospectus\u201d as a\n\u201cprospectus, notice, circular, advertisement, letter, or\ncommunication.\u201dId.,at 573\u2013574 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). We held that although the word \u201ccommunication\u201d could in\nthe abstract mean any type of communication, \u201cit is apparent that\nthe list refers to documents of wide dissemination,\u201d and that\ninclusion \u201cof the term \u2018communication\u2019 in that list suggests that\nit too refers to a public communication.\u201dId.,at 575.Applying that same approach here, we conclude\nthat a \u201cquestion\u201d or \u201cmatter\u201d must be similar in nature to a\n\u201ccause, suit, proceeding or controversy.\u201d Because a typical\nmeeting, call, or event arranged by a public official is not of the\nsame stripe as a lawsuit before a court, a determination before an\nagency, or a hearing before a committee, it does not qualify as a\n\u201cquestion\u201d or \u201cmatter\u201d under \u00a7201(a)(3).That more limited reading also comports with the\npresumption \u201cthat statutory language is not superfluous.\u201dArlington Central School Dist. Bd. of Ed.v.Murphy,\n548 U.\u00a0S. 291, 299, n. 1 (2006) . If \u201cquestion\u201d and \u201cmatter\u201d\nwere as unlimited in scope as the Government argues, the terms\n\u201ccause, suit, proceeding or controversy\u201d would serve no role in the\nstatute\u2014every \u201ccause, suit, proceeding or controversy\u201d would also\nbe a \u201cquestion\u201d or \u201cmatter.\u201d Under a more confined interpretation,\nhowever, \u201cquestion\u201d and \u201cmatter\u201d may be understood to refer to a\nformal exercise of governmental power that is similar in nature to\na \u201ccause, suit, proceeding or controversy,\u201d but that does not\nnecessarily fall into one of those prescribed categories.Because a typical meeting, call, or event is not\nitself a question or matter, the next step is to determine whether\narranging a meeting, contacting another official, or hosting an\nevent may qualify as a \u201cdecision or action\u201dona different\nquestion or matter. That requires us to first establish what counts\nas a question or matter in this case.In addition to the requirements we have\ndescribed, \u00a7201(a)(3) states that the question or matter must be\n\u201cpending\u201d or \u201cmay by law be brought\u201d before \u201cany public official.\u201d\n\u201cPending\u201d and \u201cmay by law be brought\u201d suggest something that is\nrelatively circumscribed\u2014the kind of thing that can be put on an\nagenda, tracked for progress, and then checked off as complete. In\nparticular, \u201cmayby lawbe brought\u201d conveys something within\nthe specific duties of an official\u2019s position\u2014the function\nconferred by the authority of his office. The word \u201cany\u201d conveys\nthat the matter may be pending either before the public official\nwho is performing the official act, or before another public\nofficial.The District Court, however, determined that the\nrelevant matter in this case could be considered at a much higher\nlevel of generality as \u201cVirginia business and economic\ndevelopment,\u201d or\u2014as it was often put to the jury\u2014\u201cBob\u2019s for Jobs.\u201d\nSupp. App. 88; see,e.g.,App. 1775, 2858, 2912, 3733.\nEconomic development is not naturally described as a matter\n\u201cpending\u201d before a public official\u2014or something that may be brought\n\u201cby law\u201d before him\u2014any more than \u201cjustice\u201d is pending or may be\nbrought by law before a judge, or \u201cnational security\u201d is pending or\nmay be brought by law before an officer of the Armed Forces. Under\n\u00a7201(a)(3), the pertinent \u201cquestion, matter, cause, suit,\nproceeding or controversy\u201d must be more focused and concrete.For its part, the Fourth Circuit found at least\nthree questions or matters at issue in this case: (1) \u201cwhether\nresearchers at any of Virginia\u2019s state universities would initiate\na study of Anatabloc\u201d; (2) \u201cwhether the state-created Tobacco\nIndemnification and Community Revitalization Commission\u201d would\n\u201callocate grant money for the study of anatabine\u201d; and (3) \u201cwhether\nthe health insurance plan for state employees in Virginia would\ninclude Anatabloc as a covered drug.\u201d 792 F.\u00a03d, at 515\u2013516.\nWe agree that those qualify as questions or matters under\n\u00a7201(a)(3). Each is focused and concrete, and each involves a\nformal exercise of governmental power that is similar in nature to\na lawsuit, administrative determination, or hearing.The question remains whether\u2014as the Government\nargues\u2014merely setting up a meeting, hosting an event, or calling\nanother official qualifies as a decision or action on any of those\nthree questions or matters. Although the word \u201cdecision,\u201d and\nespecially the word \u201caction,\u201d could be read expansively to support\nthe Government\u2019s view, our opinion inUnited Statesv.Sun-Diamond Growers of Cal., 526 U.\u00a0S. 398 (1999) ,\nrejects that interpretation.InSun-Diamond, the Court stated that it\nwas not an \u201cofficial act\u201d under \u00a7201 for the President to host a\nchampionship sports team at the White House, the Secretary of\nEducation to visit a high school, or the Secretary of Agriculture\nto deliver a speech to \u201cfarmers concerning various matters of USDA\npolicy.\u201dId., at 407. We recognized that \u201cthe Secretary of\nAgriculturealwayshas before him or in prospect matters\nthat affect farmers, just as the President always has before him or\nin prospect matters that affect college and professional sports,\nand the Secretary of Education matters that affect high schools.\u201dIbid.But we concluded that the existence of such pending\nmatters was not enough to find that any action related to them\nconstituted an \u201cofficial act.\u201dIbid.It was possible to\navoid the \u201cabsurdities\u201d of convicting individuals on corruption\ncharges for engaging in such conduct, we explained, \u201cthrough the\ndefinition of that term,\u201di.e., by adopting a more\nlimited definition of \u201cofficial acts.\u201dId.,at 408.It is apparent fromSun-Diamondthat\nhosting an event, meeting with other officials, or speaking with\ninterested parties is not, standing alone, a \u201cdecision or action\u201d\nwithin the meaning of \u00a7201(a)(3), even if the event, meeting, or\nspeech is related to a pending question or matter. Instead,\nsomething more is required: \u00a7201(a)(3) specifies that the public\nofficial must make a decision or take an actiononthat\nquestion or matter, or agree to do so.For example, a decision or action to initiate a\nresearch study\u2014or a decision or action on a qualifying step, such\nas narrowing down the list of potential research topics\u2014would\nqualify as an \u201cofficial act.\u201d A public official may also make a\ndecision or take an action on a \u201cquestion, matter, cause, suit,\nproceeding or controversy\u201d by using his official position to exert\npressure onanotherofficial to perform an \u201cofficial act.\u201d\nIn addition, if a public official uses his official position to\nprovide advice to another official, knowing or intending that such\nadvice will form the basis for an \u201cofficial act\u201d by another\nofficial, that too can qualify as a decision or action for purposes\nof \u00a7201(a)(3). SeeUnited Statesv.Birdsall, 233\nU.\u00a0S. 223, 234 (1914) (finding \u201cofficial action\u201d on the part\nof subordinates where their superiors \u201cwould necessarily rely\nlargely upon the reports and advice of subordinates .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nwho were more directly acquainted with\u201d the \u201cfacts and\ncircumstances of particular cases\u201d).Under this Court\u2019s precedents, a public official\nis not required to actually make a decision or take an action on a\n\u201cquestion, matter, cause, suit, proceeding or controversy\u201d; it is\nenough that the official agree to do so. SeeEvans, 504\nU.\u00a0S., at 268. The agreement need not be explicit, and the\npublic official need not specify the means that he will use to\nperform his end of the bargain. Nor must the public official in\nfact intend to perform the \u201cofficial act,\u201d so long as he agrees to\ndo so. A jury could, for example, conclude that an agreement was\nreached if the evidence shows that the public official received a\nthing of value knowing that it was given with the expectation that\nthe official would perform an \u201cofficial act\u201d in return. Seeibid.It is up to the jury, under the facts of the case, to\ndetermine whether the public official agreed to perform an\n\u201cofficial act\u201d at the time of the allegedquid pro quo. The\njury may consider a broad range of pertinent evidence, including\nthe nature of the transaction, to answer that question.Setting up a meeting, hosting an event, or\ncalling an official (or agreeing to do so) merely to talk about a\nresearch study or to gather additional information, however, does\nnot qualify as a decision or action on the pending question of\nwhether to initiate the study. Simply expressing support for the\nresearch study at a meeting, event, or call\u2014or sending a\nsubordinate to such a meeting, event, or call\u2014similarly does not\nqualify as a decision or action on the study, as long as the public\nofficial does not intend to exert pressure on another official or\nprovide advice, knowing or intending such advice to form the basis\nfor an \u201cofficial act.\u201d Otherwise, if every action somehow related\nto the research study were an \u201cofficial act,\u201d the requirement that\nthe public official make a decision or take an action on that\nstudy, or agree to do so, would be meaningless.Of course, this is not to say that setting up a\nmeeting, hosting an event, or making a phone call is always an\ninnocent act, or is irrelevant, in cases like this one. If an\nofficial sets up a meeting, hosts an event, or makes a phone call\non a question or matter that is or could be pending before another\nofficial, that could serve as evidence of an agreement to take an\nofficial act. A jury could conclude, for example, that the official\nwas attempting to pressure or advise another official on a pending\nmatter. And if the official agreed to exert that pressure or give\nthat advice in exchange for a thing of value, that would be\nillegal.The Government relies on this Court\u2019s decision\ninBirdsallto support a more expansive interpretation of\n\u201cofficial act,\u201d butBirdsallis fully consistent with our\nreading of \u00a7201(a)(3). We held inBirdsallthat \u201cofficial\naction\u201d could be established by custom rather than \u201cby statute\u201d or\n\u201ca written rule or regulation,\u201d and need not be a formal part of an\nofficial\u2019s decisionmaking process. 233 U.\u00a0S.,at\n230\u2013231. That does not mean, however, that every decision or action\ncustomarily performed by a public official\u2014such as the myriad\ndecisions to refer a constituent to another official\u2014counts as an\n\u201cofficial act.\u201d The \u201cofficial action\u201d at issue inBirdsallwas \u201cadvis[ing] the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, contrary to the\ntruth,\u201d that the facts of the case warranted granting leniency to\ncertain defendants convicted of \u201cunlawfully selling liquor to\nIndians.\u201dId.,at 227\u2013230. That \u201cdecision or action\u201d fits\nneatly within our understanding of \u00a7201(a)(3): It reflected a\ndecision or action to advise another officialonthe pending\nquestion whether to grant leniency.In sum, an \u201cofficial act\u201d is a decision or\naction on a \u201cquestion, matter, cause, suit, proceeding or\ncontroversy.\u201d The \u201cquestion, matter, cause, suit, proceeding or\ncontroversy\u201d must involve a formal exercise of governmental power\nthat is similar in nature to a lawsuit before a court, a\ndetermination before an agency, or a hearing before a committee. It\nmust also be something specific and focused that is \u201cpending\u201d or\n\u201cmay by law be brought\u201d before a public official. To qualify as an\n\u201cofficial act,\u201d the public official must make a decision or take an\naction on that \u201cquestion, matter, cause, suit, proceeding or\ncontroversy,\u201d or agree to do so. That decision or action may\ninclude using his official position to exert pressure on another\nofficial to perform an \u201cofficial act,\u201d or to advise another\nofficial, knowing or intending that such advice will form the basis\nfor an \u201cofficial act\u201d by another official. Setting up a meeting,\ntalking to another official, or organizing an event (or agreeing to\ndo so)\u2014without more\u2014does not fit that definition of \u201cofficial\nact.\u201dBIn addition to being inconsistent with both\ntext and precedent, the Government\u2019s expansive interpretation of\n\u201cofficial act\u201d would raise significant constitutional concerns.\nSection 201 prohibitsquid pro quocorruption\u2014the exchange\nof a thing of value for an \u201cofficial act.\u201d In the Government\u2019s\nview, nearly anything a public official accepts\u2014from a campaign\ncontribution to lunch\u2014counts as aquid; and nearly anything\na public official does\u2014from arranging a meeting to inviting a guest\nto an event\u2014counts as aquo. See Brief for United States 14,\n27; Tr. of Oral Arg. 34\u201335, 44\u201346.But conscientious public officials arrange\nmeetings for constituents, contact other officials on their behalf,\nand include them in events all the time. The basic compact\nunderlying representative governmentassumesthat public\nofficials will hear from their constituents and act appropriately\non their concerns\u2014whether it is the union official worried about a\nplant closing or the homeowners who wonder why it took five days to\nrestore power to their neighborhood after a storm. The Government\u2019s\nposition could cast a pall of potential prosecution over these\nrelationships if the union had given a campaign contribution in the\npast or the homeowners invited the official to join them on their\nannual outing to the ballgame. Officials might wonder whether they\ncould respond to even the most commonplace requests for assistance,\nand citizens with legitimate concerns might shrink from\nparticipating in democratic discourse.This concern is substantial. White House counsel\nwho worked in every administration from that of President Reagan to\nPresident Obama warn that the Government\u2019s \u201cbreathtaking expansion\nof public-corruption law would likely chill federal officials\u2019\ninteractions with the people they serve and thus damage their\nability effectively to perform their duties.\u201d Brief for Former\nFederal Officials asAmici Curiae6.

Far from it. But the\nGovernment\u2019s legal interpretation is not confined to cases\ninvolving extravagant gifts or large sums of money, and we\ncannotconstrue a criminal statute on the assumption that the\nGovernment will \u201cuse it responsibly.\u201dUnited Statesv.Stevens, 559 U.\u00a0S. 460, 480 (2010) . The Court inSun-Diamonddeclined to rely on \u201cthe Government\u2019s\ndiscretion\u201d to protect against overzealous prosecutions under \u00a7201,\nconcluding instead that \u201ca statute in this field that can\nlinguistically be interpreted to be either a meat axe or a scalpel\nshould reasonably be taken to be the latter.\u201d 526 U.\u00a0S., at\n408, 412.A related concern is that, under the\nGovernment\u2019s interpretation, the term \u201cofficial act\u201d is not defined\n\u201cwith sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand\nwhat conduct is prohibited,\u201d or \u201cin a manner that does not\nencourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.\u201dSkilling, 561 U.\u00a0S., at 402\u2013403 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).

In light of our\ninterpretation of the term \u201cofficial acts,\u201d those instructions\nlacked important qualifications, rendering them significantly\noverinclusive.First, the instructions did not adequately\nexplain to the jury how to identify the \u201cquestion, matter, cause,\nsuit, proceeding or controversy.\u201d As noted, the Fourth Circuit held\nthat \u201cthe Government presented evidence of three questions or\nmatters\u201d: (1) \u201cwhether researchers at any of Virginia\u2019s state\nuniversities would initiate a study of Anatabloc\u201d; (2) \u201cwhether the\nstate-created Tobacco Indemnification and Community Revitalization\nCommission\u201d would \u201callocate grant money for the study of\nanatabine\u201d; and (3) \u201cwhether the health insurance plan for state\nemployees in Virginia would include Anatabloc as a covered drug.\u201d\n792 F.\u00a03d, at 515\u2013516.The problem with the District Court\u2019s\ninstructions is that they provided no assurance that the jury\nreached its verdict after finding those questions or matters. The\ntestimony at trial described how Governor McDonnell set up\nmeetings, contacted other officials, and hosted events. It is\npossible the jury thought that a typical meeting, call, or event\nwas itself a \u201cquestion, matter, cause, suit, proceeding or\ncontroversy.\u201d If so, the jury could have convicted Governor\nMcDonnell without finding that he committedor agreed to commit an\n\u201cofficial act,\u201d as properly defined. To prevent this problem, the\nDistrict Court should have instructed the jury that it must\nidentify a \u201cquestion, matter, cause, suit, proceeding or\ncontroversy\u201d involving the formal exercise of governmental\npower.Second, the instructions did not inform the jury\nthat the \u201cquestion, matter, cause, suit, proceeding or controversy\u201d\nmust be more specific and focused than a broad policy objective.\nThe Government told the jury in its closing argument that\n\u201c[w]hatever it was\u201d Governor McDonnell had done, \u201cit\u2019s all official\naction.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 263a\u2013264a. Based on that remark,\nand the repeated references to \u201cBob\u2019s for Jobs\u201d at trial, the jury\ncould have thought that the relevant \u201cquestion, matter, cause,\nsuit, proceeding or controversy\u201d was something as nebulous as\n\u201cVirginia business and economic development,\u201d as the District Court\nitself concluded. Supp. App. 87\u201388 (\u201cThe alleged official actions\nin this case were within the range of actions on questions,\nmatters, or causes pending before McDonnell as Governor as multiple\nwitnesses testified that Virginia business and economic development\nwas a top priority in McDonnell\u2019s administration\u201d). To avoid that\nmisconception, the District Court should have instructed the jury\nthat the pertinent \u201cquestion, matter, cause, suit, proceeding or\ncontroversy\u201d must be something specific and focused that is\n\u201cpending\u201d or \u201cmay by law be brought before any public official,\u201d\nsuch as the question whether to initiate the research studies.Third, the District Court did not instruct the\njury that to convict Governor McDonnell, it had to find that he\nmade a decision or took an action\u2014or agreed to do so\u2014onthe\nidentified \u201cquestion, matter, cause, suit, proceeding or\ncontroversy,\u201d as we have construed that requirement. At trial,\nseveral of Governor McDonnell\u2019s subordinates testified that he\nasked them to attend a meeting, not that he expected them to do\nanything other than that. See,e.g.,App. 3075, 3739\u20133740,\n4220. If that testimony reflects what Governor McDonnell agreed to\ndo at the time he accepted the loans and gifts from Williams, then\nhe did not agree to make a decision or take an action on any of the\nthree questions or matters described by the Fourth Circuit.The jury may have disbelieved that testimony or\nfound other evidence that Governor McDonnell agreed to exert\npressure on those officials to initiate the research studies or add\nAnatabloc to the state health plan, but it is also possible that\nthe jury convicted Governor McDonnell without finding that he\nagreed to make a decision or take an action on a properly defined\n\u201cquestion, matter, cause, suit, proceeding or controversy.\u201d To\nforestall that possibility, the District Court should have\ninstructed the jury that merely arranging a meeting or hosting an\nevent to discuss a matter does not count as a decision or action on\nthat matter.Because the jury was not correctly instructed on\nthe meaning of \u201cofficial act,\u201d it may have convicted Governor\nMcDonnell for conduct that is not unlawful. For that reason, we\ncannot conclude that the errors in the jury instructions were\n\u201charmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201dNederv.United\nStates, 527 U.\u00a0S. 1, 16 (1999) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). We accordingly vacate Governor McDonnell\u2019s\nconvictions.BGovernor McDonnell raises two additional\nclaims. First, he argues that the charges against him must be\ndismissed because the honest services statute and the Hobbs Act are\nunconstitutionally vague. See Brief for Petitioner 58\u201361. We reject\nthat claim. For purposes of this case, the parties defined honest\nservices fraud and Hobbs Act extortion with reference to \u00a7201 of\nthe federal bribery statute. Because we have interpreted the term\n\u201cofficial act\u201d in \u00a7201(a)(3) in a way that avoids the vagueness\nconcerns raised by Governor McDonnell, we decline to invalidate\nthose statutes under the facts here. SeeSkilling, 561\nU.\u00a0S., at 403 (seeking \u201cto construe, not condemn, Congress\u2019\nenactments\u201d).Second, Governor McDonnell argues that the\ncharges must be dismissed because there is insufficient evidence\nthat he committed an \u201cofficial act,\u201d or that he agreed to do so.\nBrief for Petitioner 44\u201345. Because the parties have not had an\nopportunity to address that question in light of the interpretation\nof \u00a7201(a)(3) adopted by this Court, we leave it for the Court of\nAppeals to resolve in the first instance. If the court below\ndetermines that there is sufficient evidence for a jury to convict\nGovernor McDonnell of committing or agreeing to commit an \u201cofficial\nact,\u201d his case may be set for a new trial. If the court instead\ndetermines that the evidence is insufficient, the charges against\nhim must be dismissed. We express no view on that question.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*There is no doubt that this case is\ndistasteful; it may be worse than that. But our concern is not with\ntawdry tales of Ferraris, Rolexes, and ball gowns. It is instead\nwith the broader legal implications of the Government\u2019s boundless\ninterpretation of the federal bribery statute. A more limited\ninterpretation of the term \u201cofficial act\u201d leaves ample room for\nprosecuting corruption, while comporting with the text of the\nstatute and the precedent of this Court.The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated,\nand the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with\nthis opinion.It is so ordered.",
