S. ____ (2008)SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESNO. 06-1322FEDERAL EXPRESS CORPORATION, PETITIONERv.PAUL HOLOWECKI et\u00a0al.on writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the second circuit[February 27, 2008]Justice Thomas, with whom Justice\nScalia joins, dissenting.Today the Court decides that a\n\u201ccharge\u201d of age discrimination under the Age Discrimination in\nEmployment Act of 1967 (ADEA) is whatever the Equal Employment\nOpportunity Commission (EEOC) says it is. The filing at issue in\nthis case did not state that it was a charge and did not include a\ncharge form; to the contrary, it included a form that expressly\nstated it was for the purpose of \u201cpre-charge\u201d counseling. What is\nmore, the EEOC did not assign it a charge number, notify the\nemployer of the complainant\u2019s[Footnote 1] allegations, or commence enforcement\nproceedings. Notwithstanding these facts, the Court concludes,\ncounterintuitively, that respondent\u2019s filing is a charge because it\nmanifests an intent for the EEOC to take \u201csome action.\u201dAnte, at 9. Because the standard the Court applies is\nbroader than the ordinary meaning of the term \u201ccharge,\u201d and because\nit is so malleable that it effectively absolves the EEOC of its\nobligation to administer the ADEA according to discernible\nstandards, I respectfully dissent.IAs the Court notes, the ADEA\ndirects the agency to take certain actions upon receipt of a\n\u201ccharge\u201d but does not define that word.Ante, at 3\u20134.\nBecause there is nothing to suggest that Congress used \u201ccharge\u201d as\na term of art, we must construe it \u201cin accordance with its ordinary\nor natural meaning.\u201d SeeFDICv.Meyer,510 U. S. 471, 476\n(1994). Dictionaries define a \u201ccharge\u201d as an accusation or\nindictment. See,e.g., American Heritage Dictionary 312\n(4th ed. 2000); Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 377\n(1993). In legal parlance, a \u201ccharge\u201d is generally a formal\nallegation of wrongdoing that initiates legal proceedings against\nan alleged wrongdoer. In criminal law, for example, a charge is\ndefined as \u201c[a] formal accusation of an offense as a preliminary\nstep to prosecution.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 248 (8th ed. 2004).\nSimilarly, in this context, a \u201ccharge\u201d is a formal accusation of\ndiscrimination that objectively manifests an intent to initiate\nenforcement proceedings against the employer. Just as a complaint\nor police report that describes the commission of a crime is not a\n\u201ccharge\u201d under the criminal law, so too here, a document that\nmerely describes the alleged discrimination and requests the EEOC\u2019s\nassistance, but does not objectively manifest an intent to initiate\nenforcement proceedings, is not a \u201ccharge\u201d within the meaning of\nthe ADEA.This understanding of a \u201ccharge\u201d\nis common in administrative law. The regulations governing\nallegations of unlawful employment practices at the Government\nAccountability Office, for example, define \u201ccharge\u201d as \u201cany request\nfiled \u2026 to investigate any matter\u201d within the jurisdiction of the\nagency. 4 CFR \u00a728.3 (2006). In actions alleging unfair labor\npractices, the \u201cpurpose of the charge is \u2026 to set in motion the\n[National Labor Relations] Board\u2019s investigative machinery.\u201dFlex Plastics, Inc., 262 N.\u00a0L.\u00a0R.\u00a0B. 651,\n652 (1982). In accordance with the charge\u2019s purpose of triggering\nan investigation that involves notice to the employer, agencies\noften indicate that the charge will not be kept confidential. For\nexample, the EEOC anticipates that a charge usually will be\nreleased to the employer. See,e.g., 1 EEOC Compliance\nManual \u00a72.2(b), p. 2:0001 (Aug. 2002) (hereinafter EEOC Manual)\n(providing that correspondence may be processed as a charge if,inter alia, it \u201cdoes not express concerns about\nconfidentiality\u201d); \u00a73.6, at 3:0001 (noting that \u201cit is EEOC policy\nto \u2026 serve the [employer] with a copy of ADEA charges unless this\nwill impede EEOC\u2019s law enforcement functions\u201d).The ordinary understanding of the term\n\u201ccharge\u201d applies equally in the employment discrimination context,\nwhere a charge is a formal accusation that an employer has\nviolated, or will violate, employment discrimination laws. See 29\nCFR \u00a71626.3 (2007) (describing a charge as an allegation that an\nemployer \u201chas engaged in or is about to engage in actions in\nviolation of the Act\u201d). The charge is presented to the agency with\njurisdiction over such matters\u2014the EEOC\u2014to trigger enforcement\nproceedings that are intended to eliminate violations of the ADEA.\nSee 29 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7626(d) (directing the agency, upon receipt of\na charge, to notify the employer and take steps to eliminate the\nallegedly unlawful practice). I therefore agree with the EEOC that\nthe statutory term \u201ccharge\u201d must mean, at a minimum,[Footnote 2] a writing that objectively\nindicates an intent to initiate the agency\u2019s enforcement processes.\nSee Brief for United States asAmicus Curiae15 (noting\nthat a charge must \u201cobjectively manifest an intent to make a formal\naccusation\u201d of an ADEA violation). To the extent the Court\u2019s test\nis subjective, see,e.g., ante,at 11 (noting that a\ncharge indicates that the complainant \u201cwants\u201d to activate the\nEEOC\u2019s processes), I disagree with the Court\u2019s formulation as\ninconsistent with the objective test that is the EEOC\u2019s \u201cconsidered\nview.\u201d[Footnote 3] See Brief\nfor United States asAmicus Curiae15. In any event,\nrespondent\u2019s documents do not objectively indicate an intent to\ninitiate the EEOC\u2019s processes; any test that construes them\notherwise is, in my opinion, an unreasonable construction of the\nstatutory term \u201ccharge,\u201d and unworthy of deference. SeeChevron\nU. S.\u00a0A. Inc.v.Natural Resources Defense Council,\nInc.,467 U. S. 837, 843\u2013845 (1984).IIThe cumulative effect of two\naspects of respondent\u2019s documents, the Court holds, illustrates\nthat she filed a charge of discrimination: first, her request in\nher affidavit that the agency take action, and second, her marking\nof a box on the questionnaire form consenting to the release of her\nidentity to her employer, Federal Express Corporation (FedEx).Ante, at 14. In my view, neither of these factors,\nseparately or together, objectively indicates that respondent\nintended to initiate the EEOC\u2019s processes.The last substantive paragraph of\nrespondent\u2019s affidavit said: \u201cPlease force Federal Express to end\ntheir age discrimination \u2026 .\u201d App. 273. But the issue here is not\nwhether respondent wanted the EEOC to cause the company\u2019s\ncompliance byanymeans; it is whether she wanted the EEOC\nimmediately to employ the particular method of enforcement that\nconsists of filing a charge. Her request to \u201cforce Federal Express\nto end their age discrimination\u201d could have been met by the\nagency\u2019sbeginningthe interviewing and counseling process\nthat would ultimately lead to a charge. Or the agency could have\nproceeded to enforcement without a charge. Seeinfra, at\n10\u201311, n.\u00a05 (discussing the EEOC\u2019s authority to investigate\nage discrimination in the absence of any charge). Alternately,\nafter receiving indications of repeated violations by a particular\ncompany on many intake questionnaires, the agency could have\napproached the company informally, effectively forcing compliance\nby the threat of agency litigation. See B. Lindemann & D.\nKadue, Age Discrimination in Employment Law 470 (2003) (\u201cThe EEOC\nmay commence litigation under the ADEA without having to first file\na charge, so long as it has attempted conciliation\u201d). That sort of\naction would also have satisfied respondent\u2019s request. Respondent\u2019s\nstatement to the EEOC no more constitutes expression of a present\nintent to file a charge than her request to a lawyer that he put an\nend to her employer\u2019s discrimination would constitute expression of\npresent intent to file a complaint. The Court is simply wrong to\nsay that a charge must merely request that the agency take \u201csome\naction,\u201dante, at 9, or \u201cwhatever action is necessary to\nvindicate her rights,\u201dante, at 6, or unspecified\n\u201cremedial action to protect the employee\u2019s rights,\u201dante,\nat 11. To the contrary, a charge must request that the agency takethe particular formof remedial action that results from\nfiling a charge.Aside from revealing the ambiguity in its\ndefinition of a \u201ccharge,\u201d the Court\u2019s constructions stretch the\nterm far beyond what it can bear. A mere request for help from a\ncomplainant\u2014who, the Court acknowledges, may \u201chave no detailed\nknowledge of the relevant statutory mechanisms and agency\nprocesses,\u201dante, at 11\u201312\u2014cannot be equated with an\nintent to file a charge. The Court\u2019s test permits no principled\nbasis for distinguishing a request for the agency to take what\nmight be described as \u201cpre-charge\u201d actions, such as interviewing\nand counseling, from a request for the agency to commence\nenforcement proceedings. All are properly considered \u201cagency\naction,\u201d all presumably would be part of the agency\u2019s remedial\nprocesses, and all are designed to protect the employee\u2019s rights.\nBut a complainant\u2019s intent to trigger actions unrelated to\ncharge-processing plainly cannot form the basis for distinguishing\ncharges from other inquiries because it lacks any grounding in the\nmeaning of the statutory term.Even if respondent\u2019s statement, viewed in\nisolation, could reasonably be understood as reflecting the\nrequisite intent, it must be viewed in context. It is clear that\nrespondent\u2019s filing, taken as a whole, did not amount to a request\nfor the EEOC to commence enforcement proceedings. In fact,\nrespondent\u2019s affidavit is replete with indications of an intentnotto commence formal agency action. The entire first\nparagraph is an extensive statement that respondent had been\nassured her affidavit would be kept confidential, App. 266,\nsuggesting that she did not intend the document to initiate\nenforcement proceedings, which would require the EEOC to notify\nFedEx of her allegations. See 1 EEOC Manual \u00a72.2(b), at 2:0001\n(stating that correspondence expressing concerns about\nconfidentiality should not be treated as a charge). She identified\nthe document as a \u201ccomplaint.\u201d App. 266. And although the document\nwas notarized and respondent attested to its truthfulness, nowhere\ndid she state that she authorized the EEOC to attempt to resolve\nthe dispute.Id., at 266\u2013274. Finally, the affidavit was\nattached to the intake questionnaire, which also gave no objective\nindication of any intent to activate the EEOC\u2019s enforcement\nproceedings.As the Court concedes, the agency would not\nconsider respondent\u2019s intake questionnaire a charge.Ante,\nat 14. Indeed, we are in agreement that the form contains numerous\nindicators that it willnotbe considered a charge.Ibid. (stating that the \u201cdesign of the form \u2026 does not\ngive rise to the inference that the employee requests action\nagainst the employer,\u201d and \u201c[i]n fact the wording of the\nquestionnaire suggests the opposite\u201d). The title of the form,\n\u201cIntake Questionnaire,\u201d[Footnote\n4] suggests that its purpose is preliminary\ninformation-gathering, not the filing of a formal charge. Likewise,\nthe statement at the top of the form indicates that further steps\nare anticipated: \u201cPlease answer the following questions, telling us\nbriefly why you have been discriminated against in employment. An\nofficer of the EEOC will talk with you after you complete this\nform.\u201d App. 265. The form gives the complainant the opportunity to\nkeep her identity confidential.Ibid. And it contains a\nPrivacy Act statement on the back, prominently referenced on the\nfront of the form, which states that the information provided on\nthe questionnaire \u201cwill be used by Commission employees to\ndetermine the existence of facts relevant to a decision as to\nwhether the Commission has jurisdiction overpotential\ncharges, complaints or allegations of employment\ndiscrimination and to provide suchpre-charge filingcounseling as is appropriate.\u201dIbid.(emphasis added).The Court apparently believes that these\nobjective indicators are trumped by the fact that respondent marked\nthe box authorizing the agency to disclose her identity to her\nemployer. That portion of the form states: \u201cNormally, your identity\nwill be disclosed to the organization which allegedly discriminated\nagainst you. Do you consent or not consent to such disclosure?\u201dIbid. Since the form states it is for a narrow purpose and\nthat identities of complainants are normally disclosed, there is no\nreason to view respondent\u2019s checking of the box as converting the\nform\u2019s stated narrow purpose to a broader one.In comparison to the intake questionnaire, the\nCharge of Discrimination form contains a number of objective\nindications that it will trigger the agency\u2019s enforcement\nprocesses. Indeed, its very title clearly indicates that it is a\ncharge, and it contains a space for a charge number. 1 EEOC Manual\nExh. 2\u2013C, at 2:0009. Although both forms require the complainant to\nsign and attest that the information is correct, only the Charge of\nDiscrimination requests an attestation that the complainant intends\nto initiate the agency\u2019s procedures. Just above the space for the\ncomplainant\u2019s signature, the form states \u201cI want this charge filed\nwith both the EEOC and the State or local Agency, if any. I will\nadvise the agencies if I change my address or telephone number and\nI will cooperate fully with them in the processing of my charge in\naccordance with their procedures.\u201dIbid. The form notes\n\u201cCharging party\u201d at the bottom of the space for the signature.Ibid. And it states on the back that \u201c[t]he purpose of the\ncharge, whether recorded initially on this form or in some other\nway reduced to writing and later recorded on this form, is to\ninvoke the jurisdiction of the Commission.\u201dId.,Exh. 2\u2013C,\nat 2:0010. Also on the back, under \u201cROUTINE USES,\u201d the Charge of\nDiscrimination states that \u201c[i]nformation provided on this form\nwill be used by Commission employees to guide the Commission\u2019s\ninvestigatory activities.\u201dIbid. Although the EEOC prefers\nto receive a completed charge form, see Brief for United States asAmicus Curiae18, n.\u00a09 (noting that \u201cEEOC\u2019s preferred\npractice is indeed to receive a completed Form 5 whenever\npossible\u201d), another writing could indicate a complainant\u2019s intent\nto commence the EEOC\u2019s enforcement processes. But the form chosen\nby the complainant must be viewed as strong evidence of the\ncomplainant\u2019s intent, and that evidence should be deemed overcome\nonly if the document, viewed as a whole, compels that\nconclusion.For the reasons I have described, respondent\u2019s\nintake questionnaire and attached affidavit do not objectively\nindicate that she intended to initiate the EEOC\u2019s enforcement\nprocesses. The Court\u2019s conclusion that the two factors \u201cwere enough\nto bring the entire filing within the definition of charge,\u201dante, at 15, is not supported by the facts and, in my\nview, reveals that the Court\u2019s standard is sufficiently vacuous to\npermit the agency\u2019spost hocinterpretation of a document\nto control. But we cannot, under the guise of deference, sanction\nan agency\u2019s use of a standard that the agency has not adequately\nexplained. Cf.,e.g.,Pearsonv.Shalala, 164 F. 3d 650, 660\u2013661 (CADC 1999) (equating an\nagency\u2019s denial of a party\u2019s request based on the application of a\nvague term with simply saying \u201cno\u201d without explanation).The malleability of the Court\u2019s test is\nfurther revealed by its statement that \u201c[t]here might be instances\nwhere the indicated discrimination is so clear or pervasive that\nthe agency could infer from the allegations themselves that action\nis requested and required.\u201dAnte, at 14. The clarity or\npervasiveness of alleged discrimination is irrelevant to the\nemployee\u2019s intent to file a charge. Although the Court states that\nthe \u201cagency is not required to treat every completed Intake\nQuestionnaire as a charge,\u201dibid., it apparently would\npermit the EEOC to do so, because under the Court\u2019s test the EEOC\ncan infer intent from circumstances\u2014such as \u201cclear or pervasive\u201d\ndiscrimination\u2014that have no grounding in the \u201cintent to act\u201d\nrequirement.[Footnote 5]IIIYet another indication that\nrespondent\u2019s documents did not objectively manifest an intent to\ninitiate the EEOC\u2019s enforcement processes is that the agency did\nnot treat them as a charge. It did not assign a charge number, and\nit did not notify FedEx or commence its enforcement proceedings.\nThis is not surprising: The EEOC accepts charges via a thorough\nintake process[Footnote 6] in\nwhich completed intake questionnaires are not typically viewed as\ncharges, but are used to assist the EEOC in developing the charge.\nA complainant visiting an EEOC office may be asked to complete an\nintake questionnaire. See EEOC FAQ, Answer to \u201cHow do I file a\ncharge of employment discrimination?\u201d, online at\nhttps://eeoc.custhelp.com. An EEOC investigator then conducts a\nprecharge interview, 1 EEOC Manual \u00a72.4, at 2:0001; 2 B. Lindemann\n& P. Grossman, Employment Discrimination Law 1685 (4th ed.\n2007), covering a range of topics, including applicable laws, the\ncomplainant\u2019s allegations and other possibly discriminatory\npractices, confidentiality, time limits, notice requirements, and\nprivate suit rights. See 1 EEOC Manual \u00a7\u00a72.4(a)\u2013(g), at\n2:0001\u20132:0003. Using the information contained in the intake\nquestionnaire and gathered during the interview, the investigator\ndrafts the charge on a Form 5 Charge of Discrimination according to\nspecific agency instructions, and also drafts an affidavit\ncontaining background data. Seeid.,\u00a72.5, at\n2:0003\u20132:0005. The investigator assigns a charge number and begins\nthe process of serving notice on the employer and investigating the\nallegations. See 2 Lindemann & Grossman,supra, at\n1685\u20131690.Charges are thus typically\ncompleted and filed by the agency, not the complainant.SeeEdelmanv.Lynchburg College,535 U. S. 106,\n115, n.\u00a09 (2002) (\u201cThe general practice of EEOC staff members\nis to prepare a formal charge of discrimination for the complainant\nto review and to verify\u201d (citing Brief for United States\net\u00a0al. asAmici Curiae24)); EEOC FAQ, Answers to\n\u201cWhere can I obtain copies of the forms to file a charge?\u201d (stating\nthat the agency\u2019s policy is not to provide blank charge forms);\n\u201cHow do I file a charge of employment discrimination?\u201d (\u201cWhen the\nfield office has all the information it needs, you will be\ncounseled regarding the strengths and weaknesses of a potential\ncharge and/or you will receive a completed charge form (Form 5) for\nyour signature\u201d), online at https://eeoc.custhelp.com. Once the\ncharge is complete, the EEOC notifies the employer of the charge,\nusually attaching a copy of the completed charge form. 1 EEOC\nManual \u00a73.6, at 3:0001 (\u201cWhile 29 CFR \u00a71626.11 only requires notice\nto the [employer] that an ADEA charge has been filed, it is EEOC\npolicy to also serve the [employer] with a copy of ADEA charges\nunless this will impede EEOC\u2019s law enforcement functions\u201d); Inzeo\nMemorandum, online at\nhttp://www.eeoc.gov/charge/memo-8-13-07.html.To be sure, the EEOC is\nprepared to accept charges by other methods. If the complainant\ncannot or will not visit an EEOC office, an investigator may\nconduct the pre-charge interview and take the charge by telephone,\nsee 1 EEOC Manual \u00a7\u00a72.3, 2.4, at 2:0001, but the agency must reduce\nthe allegations to writing before they will be considered a charge,\nsee 29 CFR \u00a71626.8(b) (\u201c[A] charge is sufficient when the\nCommission receives from the person making the charge either a\nwritten statement or information reduced to writing by the\nCommission that conforms to the requirements of \u00a71626.6\u201d). When the\nEEOC receives correspondence that is a potential charge, the\ninvestigator must contact the complainant and conduct an intake\ninterview. See 1 EEOC Manual \u00a72.2(a), at 2:0001. Alternatively, if\nthe correspondence \u201ccontains all information necessary to begin\ninvestigating, constitutes a clear and timely request for EEOC to\nact, and does not express concerns about confidentiality or\nretaliation,\u201d then the investigator may process it as a charge\nwithout conducting an interview. Seeid.,\u00a72.2(b), at\n2:0001.Thus, while the EEOC does not\ntypically view an intake questionnaire as a charge, I would not\nrule out the possibility that, in appropriate circumstances, an\nintake questionnaire, like other correspondence, could contain the\nelements necessary to constitute a charge. But an intake\nquestionnaire\u2014even one accompanied by an affidavit\u2014should not be\nconstrued as a charge unless it objectively indicates an intent to\ninitiate the EEOC\u2019s enforcement processes. As I have explained,\nrespondent\u2019s intake questionnaire and attached affidavit fall short\nof that standard. I would hold that the documents respondent filed\nwith the EEOC were not a charge and thus did not preserve her right\nto sue.The implications of the\nCourt\u2019s decision will reach far beyond respondent\u2019s case. Today\u2019s\ndecision does nothing\u2014absolutely nothing\u2014to solve the problem that\nunder the EEOC\u2019s current processes no one can tell,ex\nante, whether a particular filing is or is not a charge. Given\nthe Court\u2019s utterly vague criteria, whatever the agency later\ndecides to regard as a charge is a charge\u2014and the statutorily\nrequired notice to the employer and conciliation process will be\nevaded in the future as it has been in this case. The Court\u2019s\nfailure to apply a clear and sensible rule renders its decision of\nlittle use in future cases to complainants, employers, or the\nagency.For these reasons, I would\nreverse the judgment below.Footnote\n1This opinion will refer to\npotentially-charging parties who contact the EEOC about\ndiscrimination as \u201ccomplainants.\u201d I use this term for simplicity\nand do not intend to invoke the distinction in the EEOC\u2019s\nregulations between complainants and charging parties. See 29 CFR\n\u00a71626.3 (2007). Similarly, I use \u201crespondent\u201d not as it appears in\nthe EEOC\u2019s regulations\u2014referring to the \u201cprospective defendant in a\ncharge or complaint,\u201dibid.\u2014but as a reference to the\nresponding parties in this case.Footnote\n2I do not mean to foreclose\nthe possibility that the EEOC may include additional elements in\nits definition, as long as they are reasonable constructions of the\nstatutory term \u201ccharge.\u201d SeeChevron U. S.\u00a0A. Inc.v.Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,467 U. S. 837, 843\u2013845\n(1984).Footnote\n3As the EEOC\nacknowledges, its position on whether intent is required has varied\nover the years. See Brief for United States asAmicus\nCuriae8, 16\u201317, n.\u00a08. In 1983, the agency issued its\nregulations, which contain no intent requirement. Final Procedural\nRegulations; Age Discrimination in Employment Act, 48 Fed. Reg.\n138. Five years later, it argued against an intent requirement asamicus curiaeinSteffenv.Meridian Life\nIns. Co., 859 F.\u00a02d 534, 544 (CA7 1988) (\u201cThe EEOC, which\nhas appeared as amicus curiae on Steffen\u2019s behalf, has supported\nSteffen\u2019s contention that a completed Intake Questionnaire, in and\nof itself, constitutes a charge\u201d). In 2002, the agency issued an\ninternal memorandum and internal guidance documents including an\nintent requirement. See Memorandum from Elizabeth M. Thornton,\nDirector, Office of Field Programs, EEOC, to All District, Area,\nand Local Office Directors et al. (Feb. 21, 2002), online at\nhttp://www. eeoc.gov/charge/memo-2-21-02.html (all Internet\nmaterials as visited Feb. 22, 2008 and available in Clerk of\nCourt\u2019s case file); 1 EEOC Manual \u00a72.2(b), at 2:0001 (noting that\ncorrespondence must,inter alia, \u201cconstitut[e] a clear and\ntimely request for EEOC to act\u201d before it can be construed as a\ncharge). The EEOC contradicted itself four years later, when it\nagain took the position that there was no intent requirement inGordonv.Shafer Contracting Co., 469 F.\u00a03d\n1191, 1194 (CA8 2006) (\u201cIn an amicus brief, the EEOC urges us to\naccept such a verified Intake Questionnaire as satisfying the\ncharge requirement\u201d); see also Brief for United States asAmicus Curiae16\u201317, n.\u00a08. The following year, the\nEEOC issued another internal memorandum and updated the Frequently\nAsked Questions section of its Web site, including the intent\nrequirement in each.

(Aug. 13, 2007) (hereinafter\nInzeo Memorandum), online at\nhttp://www.eeoc.gov/charge/memo-8-13-07.html; EEOC Frequently Asked\nQuestions, Answer to \u201cHow do I file a charge of employment\ndiscrimination?\u201d (hereinafter EEOC FAQ), online at\nhttps://eeoc.custhelp.com.Footnote\n4An apparently more recent\nversion of Form 283 is entitled \u201cCharge Questionnaire,\u201d and states\nthat, \u201c[w]hen this form constitutes the only timely written\nstatement of alleg[ed] . . . discrimination, the Commission will,\nconsistent with 29 CFR 1601.12(b) and 29 CFR 1626.8(b), consider it\nto be a sufficient charge of discrimination under the relevant\nstatute(s).\u201d 1 EEOC Manual, Exh. 1\u2013B, at 1:0006; see also B.\nLindemann & D. Kadue, Age Discrimination in Employment Law 477,\nn.\u00a014 (2003). Although the \u201cCharge Questionnaire\u201d form is\ndated \u201cTest 10/94,\u201d and is the only questionnaire form included in\nthe Compliance Manual, it was not the form respondent used. Her\nintake questionnaire form was dated 1987. App. 265.Footnote\n5Perhaps the Court\u2019s statement\nis intended to address the EEOC\u2019s authority to investigate alleged\ndiscrimination even in the absence of a charge. Under Title VII,\nthese are called \u201cCommissioner Charges.\u201d See,e.g.,29 CFR\n\u00a71601.11(a) (2007). While the ADEA does not provide for such\ncharges, the EEOC has independent authority to investigate age\ndiscrimination in the absence of any charge. See 29 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7626(a); 29 CFR \u00a71626.4;Gilmerv.Interstate/Johnson\nLane Corp.,500\nU. S. 20, 28 (1991); 1 EEOC Manual \u00a78.1, at 8:0001 (June 2001).\nIf this is what the Court means by its statement that allegations\nof \u201cclear or pervasive\u201d discrimination may indicate to the agency\nthat action is \u201crequired,\u201dante, at 14, then it is not\nclear how it is relevant to the standards at issue in this case for\nevaluating an individual complainant\u2019s filing.Footnote\n6This process, in all respects\nrelevant to this case, has been consistently used by the agency\nsince shortly after it assumed jurisdiction over ADEA actions in\n1979. See 1 EEOC Manual \u00a7\u00a72.1\u20132.7, at 2:0001\u20132:0006; 2 B. Lindemann\n& P. Grossman, Employment Discrimination Law 1220 (3d ed.\n1996); B. Schlei & P. Grossman, Employment Discrimination Law\n939\u2013940, 942, 948 (2d ed. 1983).",
