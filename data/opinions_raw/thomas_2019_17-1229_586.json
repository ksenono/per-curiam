This case requires us to decide\nwhether the sale of an invention to a third party who is\ncontractually obligated to keep the invention confidential places\nthe invention \u201con sale\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7102(a).More than 20 years ago, this Court determined\nthat an invention was \u201con sale\u201d within the meaning of an earlier\nversion of \u00a7102(a) when it was \u201cthe subject of a commercial offer\nfor sale\u201d and \u201cready for patenting.\u201dPfaffv.Wells\nElectronics,Inc.,525 U.S.\n55, 67 (1998). We did not further require that the sale make\nthe details of the invention available to the public. In light of\nthis earlier construction, we determine that the reenactment of the\nphrase \u201con sale\u201d in the AIA did not alter this meaning.\nAccordingly, a commercial sale to a third party who is required to\nkeep the invention confidential may place the invention \u201con sale\u201d\nunder the AIA.IPetitioner Helsinn Healthcare S.\u00a0A.\n(Helsinn) is a Swiss pharmaceutical company that makes Aloxi, a\ndrug that treats chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. Helsinn\nacquired the right to develop palonosetron, the active ingredient\nin Aloxi, in 1998. In early 2000, it submitted protocols for Phase\nIII clinical trials to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA),\nproposing to study a 0.25 mg and a 0.75 mg dose of palonosetron. In\nSeptember 2000, Helsinn announced that it was beginning Phase III\nclinical trials and was seeking marketing partners for its\npalonosetron product.Helsinn found its marketing partner in MGI\nPharma, Inc. (MGI), a Minnesota pharmaceutical company that markets\nand distributes drugs in the United States. Helsinn and MGI entered\ninto two agreements: a license agreement and a supply and purchase\nagreement. The license agreement granted MGI the right to\ndistribute, promote, market, and sell the 0.25 mg and 0.75 mg doses\nof palonosetron in the United States. In return, MGI agreed to make\nupfront payments to Helsinn and to pay future royalties on\ndistribution of those doses. Under the supply and purchase\nagreement, MGI agreed to purchase exclusively from Helsinn any\npalonosetron product approved by the FDA. Helsinn in turn agreed to\nsupply MGI however much of the approved doses it required. Both\nagreements included dosage information and required MGI to keep\nconfidential any proprietary information received under the\nagreements.Helsinn and MGI announced the agreements in a\njoint press release, and MGI also reported the agreements in its\nForm 8\u2013K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nAlthough the 8\u2013K filing included redacted copies of the agreements,\nneither the 8\u2013K filing nor the press releases disclosed the\nspecific dosage formulations covered by the agreements.On January 30, 2003, nearly two years after\nHelsinn and MGI entered into the agreements, Helsinn filed a\nprovisional patent application covering the 0.25 mg and 0.75 mg\ndoses of palonosetron. Over the next 10 years, Helsinn filed four\npatent applications that claimed priority to the January 30, 2003,\ndate of the provisional application. Helsinn filed its fourth\npatent application\u2014the one relevant here\u2014in May 2013, and it issued\nas U.\u00a0S. Patent No. 8,598,219 (\u2019219 patent). The \u2019219 patent\ncovers a fixed dose of 0.25 mg of palonosetron in a 5 ml solution.\nBy virtue of its effective date, the \u2019219 patent is governed by the\nAIA. See \u00a7101(i).Respondents Teva Pharmaceutical Industries,\nLtd., and Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. (Teva), are, respectively,\nan Israeli company that manufactures generic drugs and its American\naffiliate. In 2011, Teva sought approval from the FDA to market a\ngeneric 0.25 mg palonosetron product. Helsinn then sued Teva for\ninfringing its patents, including the \u2019219 patent. In defense, Teva\nasserted that the \u2019219 patent was invalid because the 0.25 mg dose\nwas \u201con sale\u201d more than one year before Helsinn filed the\nprovisional patent application covering that dose in January\n2003.The AIA precludes a person from obtaining a\npatent on an invention that was \u201con sale\u201d before the effective\nfiling date of the patent application:\u201cA person shall be entitled to a patent\nunless .\u00a0.\u00a0. the claimed invention was patented,\ndescribed in a printed publication, or in public use,on\nsale, or otherwise available to the public before the effective\nfiling date of the claimed invention.\u201d 35 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7102(a)(1) (emphasis added).See also \u00a7102(b)(1) (exception for certain\ndisclosures made within a year before the effective filing date).\nDisclosures described in \u00a7102(a)(1) are often referred to as \u201cprior\nart.\u201dThe patent statute in effect before the passage\nof the AIA included a similar proscription, known as the \u201con-sale\nbar\u201d:\u201cA person shall be entitled to a patent\nunless\u2014\u201c(a) the invention was known or used by others\nin this country, or patented or described in a printed publication\nin this or a foreign country, before the invention thereof by the\napplicant for patent, or\u201c(b) the invention was patented or described in\na printed publication in this or a foreign country or in public use\noron salein this country, more than one year prior to the\ndate of the application for patent in the United States.\u201d 35\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a7102(a)\u2013(b) (2006 ed.) (emphasis added).The District Court determined that the \u201con sale\u201d\nprovision did not apply. It concluded that, under the AIA, an\ninvention is not \u201con sale\u201d unless the sale or offer in question\nmade the claimed invention available to the public.Helsinn\nHealthcare S.A. v.Dr.Reddy\u2019s Labs.Ltd., 2016 WL 832089, *45, *51 (D NJ, Mar. 3, 2016). Because\nthe companies\u2019 public disclosure of the agreements between Helsinn\nand MGI did not disclose the 0.25 mg dose, the court determined\nthat the invention was not \u201con sale\u201d before the critical date.Id., at *51\u2013*52.The Federal Circuit reversed. 855 F.3d 1356,\n1360 (2017). It concluded that \u201cif the existence of the sale is\npublic, the details of the invention need not be publicly disclosed\nin the terms of sale\u201d to fall within the AIA\u2019s on-sale bar.Id., at 1371. Because the sale between Helsinn and MGI was\npublicly disclosed, it held that the on-sale bar applied.Id., at 1364, 1371.We granted certiorari to determine whether,\nunder the AIA, an inventor\u2019s sale of an invention to a third party\nwho is obligated to keep the invention confidential qualifies as\nprior art for purposes of determining the patent- ability of the\ninvention. 585 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2018). We conclude that such a sale\ncan qualify as prior art.IIAThe United States Constitution authorizes\nCongress \u201c[t]o promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by\nsecuring for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive\nRight to their respective Writings and Discoveries.\u201d Art. 1, \u00a78,\ncl. 8. Under this grant of authority, Congress has crafted a\nfederal patent system that encourages \u201cthe creation and disclosure\nof new, useful, and nonobvious advances in technology and design\u201d\nby granting inventors \u201cthe exclusive right to practice the\ninvention for a period of years.\u201dBonito Boats,Inc.\nv.Thunder Craft Boats,Inc.,489\nU.S. 141, 151 (1989).To further the goal of \u201cmotivating innovation\nand enlightenment\u201d while also \u201cavoiding monopolies that\nunnecessarily stifle competition,\u201dPfaff, 525 U.\u00a0S., at\n63, Congress has imposed several conditions on the \u201climited\nopportunity to obtain a property right in an idea,\u201dBonito\nBoats,supra, at 149. One such condition is the on-sale\nbar, which reflects Congress\u2019 \u201creluctance to allow an inventor to\nremove existing knowledge from public use\u201d by obtaining a patent\ncovering that knowledge.Pfaff,supra, at 64; see\nalsoPennockv.Dialogue, 2 Pet. 1, 19 (1829)\n(explaining that \u201cit would materially retard the progress of\nscience and the useful arts\u201d to allow an inventor to \u201csell his\ninvention publicly\u201d and later \u201ctake out a patent\u201d and \u201cexclude the\npublic from any farther use than what should be derived under\nit\u201d).Every patent statute since 1836 has included an\non-sale bar.Pfaff,supra, at 65. The patent statute\nin force immediately before the AIA prevented a person from\nreceiving a patent if, \u201cmore than one year prior to the date of the\napplication for patent in the United States,\u201d \u201cthe invention was\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. on sale\u201d in the United States. 35\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7102(b) (2006 ed., Supp. IV). The AIA, as\nrelevant here, retained the on-sale bar and added the catchall\nphrase \u201cor otherwise available to the public.\u201d \u00a7102(a)(1) (2012\ned.) (\u201cA person shall be entitled to a patent unless\u201d the \u201cclaimed\ninvention was .\u00a0.\u00a0. in public use, on sale, or otherwise\navailable to the public .\u00a0.\u00a0. \u201d). We must decide whether\nthese changes altered the meaning of the \u201con sale\u201d bar. We hold\nthat they did not.BCongress enacted the AIA in 2011 against the\nbackdrop of a substantial body of law interpreting \u00a7102\u2019s on-sale\nbar. In 1998, we determined that the pre-AIA on-sale bar applies\n\u201cwhen two conditions are satisfied\u201d more than a year before an\ninventor files a patent application.Pfaff, 525 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 67. \u201cFirst, the product must be the subject of a commercial\noffer for sale.\u201dIbid. \u201cSecond, the invention must be ready\nfor patenting,\u201d which we explained could be shown by proof of\n\u201creduction to practice\u201d or \u201cdrawings or other descriptions of the\ninvention that were sufficiently specific to enable a person\nskilled in the art to practice the invention.\u201dId., at\n67\u201368.Although this Court has never addressed the\nprecise question presented in this case, our precedents suggest\nthat a sale or offer of sale need not make an invention available\nto the public. For instance, we held inPfaffthat an offer\nfor sale could cause an inventor to lose the right to patent,\nwithout regard to whether the offer discloses each detail of the\ninvention.E.g.,id., at 67. Other cases focus\non whether the invention had been sold, not whether the details of\nthe invention had been made available to the public or whether the\nsale itself had been publicly disclosed.E.g.,Consolidated Fruit-Jar Co. v.Wright,94 U.S.\n92, 94 (1877) (\u201c[A] single instance of sale or of use by the\npatentee may, under the circumstances, be fatal to the patent\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. \u201d); cf.Smith & Griggs Mfg.Co.\nv.Sprague,123 U.S.\n249, 257 (1887) (\u201cA single sale to another .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nwould certainly have defeated his right to a patent .\u00a0.\u00a0.\n\u201d);Elizabethv.Pavement Co.,97 U.S.\n126, 136 (1878) (\u201cIt is not a public knowledge of his invention\nthat precludes the inventor from obtaining a patent for it, but a\npublic use or sale of it\u201d).The Federal Circuit\u2014which has \u201cexclusive\njurisdiction\u201d over patent appeals, 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a71295(a)\u2014has made explicit what was implicit in our precedents. It\nhas long held that \u201csecret sales\u201d can invalidate a patent.E.g.,Special Devices, Inc. v.OEA,Inc.,270 F.3d 1353, 1357 (2001) (invalidating patent claims based on\n\u201csales for the purpose of the commercial stockpiling of an\ninvention\u201d that \u201ctook place in secret\u201d);Woodland Trustv.Flowertree Nursery,Inc.,148 F.3d 1368, 1370 (1998) (\u201cThus an inventor\u2019s own prior\ncommercial use, albeit kept secret, may constitute a public use or\nsale under \u00a7102(b), barring him from obtaining a patent\u201d).In light of this settled pre-AIA precedent on\nthe meaning of \u201con sale,\u201d we presume that when Congress reenacted\nthe same language in the AIA, it adopted the earlier judicial\nconstruction of that phrase. SeeShapirov.United\nStates,335 U.S.\n1, 16 (1948) (\u201cIn adopting the language used in the earlier\nact, Congress \u2018must be considered to have adopted also the\nconstruction given by this Court to such language, and made it a\npart of the enactment\u2019\u00a0\u201d). The new \u00a7102 retained the exact\nlanguage used in its predecessor statute (\u201con sale\u201d) and, as\nrelevant here, added only a new catchall clause (\u201cor otherwise\navailable to the public\u201d). AsamicusUnited States noted at\noral argument, if \u201con sale\u201d had a settled meaning before the AIA\nwas adopted, then adding the phrase \u201cor otherwise available to the\npublic\u201d to the statute \u201cwould be a fairly oblique way of attempting\nto overturn\u201d that \u201csettled body of law.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 28. The\naddition of \u201cor otherwise available to the public\u201d is simply not\nenough of a change for us to conclude that Congress intended to\nalter the meaning of the reenacted term \u201con sale.\u201d Cf.Holderv.Martinez Gutierrez,566\nU.S. 583, 593 (2012) (determining that a reenacted provision\ndid not ratify an earlier judicial construction where the provision\nomitted the word on which the prior judicial constructions were\nbased).Helsinn disagrees, arguing that our construction\nreads \u201cotherwise\u201d out of the statute. CitingParolinev.United States, 572 U.S. 434 (2014), andFederal Maritime\nComm\u2019nv.Seatrain Lines,Inc.,411 U.S.\n726(1973), Helsinn contends that the associated-words canon\nrequires us to read \u201cotherwise available to the public\u201d to limit\nthe preceding terms in \u00a7102 to disclosures that make the claimed\ninvention available to the public.As an initial matter, neither of the cited\ndecisions addresses the reenactment of terms that had acquired a\nwell-settled judicial interpretation. And Helsinn\u2019s argument places\ntoo much weight on \u00a7102\u2019s catchall phrase. Like other such phrases,\n\u201cotherwise available to the public\u201d captures material that does not\nfit neatly into the statute\u2019s enumerated categories but is\nnevertheless meant to be covered. Given that the phrase \u201con sale\u201d\nhad acquired a well-settled meaning when the AIA was enacted, we\ndecline to read the addition of a broad catchall phrase to upset\nthat body of precedent.IIIHelsinn does not ask us to revisit our pre-AIA\ninterpretation of the on-sale bar. Nor does it dispute the Federal\nCircuit\u2019s determination that the invention claimed in the \u2019219\npatent was \u201con sale\u201d within the meaning of the pre-AIA statute.\nBecause we determine that Congress did not alter the meaning of \u201con\nsale\u201d when it enacted the AIA, we hold that an inventor\u2019s sale of\nan invention to a third party who is obligated to keep the\ninvention confidential can qualify as prior art under \u00a7102(a). We\ntherefore affirm the judgment of the Federal Circuit.It is so ordered.",
