In Part\nIII\u2013E of the opinion, the Court rejects Shular\u2019s argument for\napplying the rule of lenity. I write separately to elaborate on why\nthe rule of lenity does not apply here.This Court\u2019s longstanding precedents establish\nthat the rule of lenity applies when two conditions are met.First, as the Court today says and as the\nCourt has repeatedly held, a court may invoke the rule of lenity\nonly \u201c\u00a0\u2018after consulting traditional canons of statutory\nconstruction.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAnte,at 10 (quotingUnited\nStatesv.Shabani,513 U.S.\n10, 17 (1994)).[1] In other\nwords, a court must first employ all of the traditional tools of\nstatutory interpretation, and a court may resort to the rule of\nlenity only \u201c\u00a0\u2018after seizing everything from which aid can be\nderived.\u2019\u00a0\u201dOcasiov.United States, 578\nU.\u00a0S. ___, ___, n.\u00a08 (2016) (slip op., at 13, n.\u00a08)\n(quotingMuscarellov.United States,524 U.S.\n125, 138\u2013139 (1998)). In summarizing the case law, Justice\nScalia underscored that the rule of lenity \u201c\u00a0\u2018comes into\noperation at the end of the process of construing what Congress has\nexpressed, not at the beginning.\u2019\u00a0\u201d A. Scalia & B. Garner,\nReading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 298 (2012) (quotingCallananv.United States,364\nU.S. 587, 596 (1961)). Of course, when \u201ca reviewing court\nemploys all of the traditional tools of construction, the court\nwill almost always reach a conclusion about the best\ninterpretation,\u201d thereby resolving any perceived ambiguity.Kisorv.Wilkie, 588 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2019) (slip\nop., at 1) (Kavanaugh, J., concurring in judgment). That explains\nwhy the rule of lenity rarely comes into play.Second, this Court has repeatedly\nexplained that the rule of lenity applies only in cases of\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018grievous\u2019\u00a0\u201d ambiguity\u2014where the court, even after\napplying all of the traditional tools of statutory interpretation,\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018can make no more than a guess as to what Congress\nintended.\u2019\u00a0\u201dOcasio, 578 U.\u00a0S., at ___, n.\u00a08\n(slip op., at 13, n.\u00a08) (quotingMuscarello, 524\nU.\u00a0S., at 138\u2013139). The Court has stated that the \u201csimple\nexistence of some statutory ambiguity\u201d is \u201cnot sufficient to\nwarrant application of that rule, for most statutes are ambiguous\nto some degree.\u201dId., at 138. To be sure, as Justice Scalia\nrightly noted, the term \u201c\u00a0\u2018grievous ambiguity\u2019\u00a0\u201d provides\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018little more than atmospherics, since it leaves open the\ncrucial question\u2014almost invariably present\u2014of how much\nambiguousness constitutes an ambiguity.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Reading Law, at 299\n(quotingUnited Statesv.Hansen, 772 F.2d 940, 948\n(CADC 1985) (Scalia, J., for the court)); see also Kavanaugh,\nFixing Statutory Interpretation, 129 Harv. L.\u00a0Rev. 2118\n(2016). That said, atmospherics can matter. Although the Court has\nnot always been perfectly consistent in its formulations, the Court\nhas repeatedly emphasized that a court must find not just ambiguity\nbut \u201cgrievous ambiguity\u201d before resorting to the rule of\nlenity.[2]To sum up: Under this Court\u2019s longstanding\nprecedents, the rule of lenity applies when a court employs all of\nthe traditional tools of statutory interpretation and, after doing\nso, concludes that the statute still remains grievously ambiguous,\nmeaning that the court can make no more than a guess as to what the\nstatute means.Because the Court correctly concludes that the\nrule of lenity does not apply in this case, I join the Court\u2019s\nopinion in full.Notes1See also,e.g.,\nOcasiov.United States, 578 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___,\nn.\u00a08 (2016) (slip op., at 13, n.\u00a08);Robersv.United States,572 U.S.\n639, 646 (2014);Kastenv.Saint-Gobain Performance\nPlastics Corp.,563 U.S.\n1, 16 (2011);Abbottv.United States,562 U.S.\n8, 28, n.\u00a09 (2010);United Statesv.Hayes,555 U.S.\n415, 429 (2009);Burgessv.United States,553 U.S.\n124, 135 (2008);Muscarellov.United States,524 U.S.\n125, 138 (1998);Caronv.United States,524 U.S.\n308, 316 (1998);United Statesv.Wells,519 U.S.\n482, 499 (1997);Renov.Koray,515 U.S.\n50, 65 (1995);Smithv.United States,508 U.S.\n223, 239 (1993);Gozlon-Peretzv.United States,498 U.S.\n395, 410 (1991);Moskalv.United States,498 U.S.\n103, 108 (1990);Callananv.United States,364 U.S.\n587, 596 (1961).
