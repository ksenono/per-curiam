STEAGER, WEST VIRGINIA STATE TAX COMMISSIONERon writ of certiorari to the supreme court of\nappeals of west virginia[February 20, 2019]Justice Gorsuch delivered the opinion of the\nCourt.If you spent your career as a state law\nenforcement officer in West Virginia, you\u2019re likely to be eligible\nfor a generous tax exemption when you retire. But if you served in\nfederal law enforcement, West Virginia will deny you the same\nbenefit. The question we face is whether a State may discriminate\nagainst federal retirees in that way.For most of his career, James Dawson worked in\nthe U.\u00a0S. Marshals Service. After he retired, he began looking\ninto the tax treatment of his pension. It turns out that his home\nState, West Virginia, doesn\u2019t tax the pension benefits of certain\nformer state law enforcement employees. But it does tax the\nbenefits of all former federal employees. So Mr. Dawson brought\nthis lawsuit alleging that West Virginia violated 4\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7111. In that statute, the United States has\nconsented to state taxation of the \u201cpay or compensation\u201d of\n\u201cofficer[s] or employee[s] of the United States,\u201d but only if the\n\u201ctaxation does not discriminate against the officer or employee\nbecause of the source of the pay or compensation.\u201d \u00a7111(a).Section 111 codifies a legal doctrine almost as\nold as the Nation. InMcCullochv.Maryland, 4 Wheat.\n316 (1819), this Court invoked the Constitution\u2019s Supremacy Clause\nto invalidate Maryland\u2019s effort to levy a tax on the Bank of the\nUnited States. Chief Justice Marshall explained that \u201cthe power to\ntax involves the power to destroy,\u201d and he reasoned that if States\ncould tax the Bank they could \u201cdefeat\u201d the federal legislative\npolicy establishing it.Id., at 431\u2013432. For the next few\ndecades, this Court interpretedMcCulloch\u201cto bar most\ntaxation by one sovereign of the employees of another.\u201dDavisv.Michigan Dept. of Treasury,489 U.S.\n803, 810 (1989). In time, though, the Court softened its stance\nand upheld neutral income taxes\u2014those that treated federal and\nstate employees with an even hand. SeeHelveringv.Gerhardt,304 U.S.\n405(1938);Gravesv.New York ex rel. O\u2019Keefe,306 U.S.\n466(1939). So eventually the intergovernmental tax immu- nity\ndoctrine came to be understood to bar onlydiscrimina- torytaxes. It was this understanding that Congress \u201cconsciously\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. drew upon\u201d when adopting \u00a7111 in 1939.Davis, 489 U.\u00a0S., at 813.It is this understanding, too, that has animated\nour application of \u00a7111. Since the statute\u2019s adoption, we have\nupheld an Alabama income tax that did not discriminate on the basis\nof the source of the employees\u2019 compensation.Jefferson\nCountyv.Acker,527 U.S.\n423(1999). But we have invalidated a Michigan tax that\ndiscriminated \u201cin favor of retired state employees and against\nretired federal employees.\u201dDavis, 489 U.\u00a0S., at 814.\nWe have struck down a Kansas law that taxed the retirement benefits\nof federal military personnel at a higher rate than state and local\ngovernment retirement benefits.Barkerv.Kansas,503 U.S.\n594, 599 (1992). And we have rejected a Texas scheme that\nimposed a property tax on a private company operating on land\nleased from the federal government, but a \u201cless burdensome\u201d tax on\nproperty leased from the State.Phillips Chemical Co.v.Dumas Independent School Dist.,361\nU.S. 376, 378, 380 (1960).Mr. Dawson\u2019s own attempt to invoke \u00a7111 met with\nmixed success. A West Virginia trial court found it \u201cundisputed\u201d\nthat \u201cthere are no significant differences between Mr. Dawson\u2019s\npowers and duties as a US Marshal and the powers and duties of the\nstate and local law enforcement officers\u201d that West Virginia\nexempts from income tax. App. to Pet. for Cert. 22a. In the trial\ncourt\u2019s judgment, the State\u2019s statute thus represented \u201cprecisely\nthe type of favoritism\u201d \u00a7111 prohibits.Id., at 23a. But the\nWest Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals saw it differ- ently. In\nreversing, the court emphasized that relatively few state employees\nreceive the tax break denied Mr. Dawson. The court stressed, too,\nthat the statute\u2019s \u201cintent .\u00a0.\u00a0. was to give a benefit to\na narrow class of state retirees,\u201d not to harm federal retirees.Id., at 15a. Because cases in this field have yielded\ninconsistent results, much as this one has, we granted certiorari\nto afford additional guidance. 585 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2018).We believe the state trial court had it right.\nA State violates \u00a7111 when it treats retired state employees more\nfavorably than retired federal employees and no \u201csignificant\ndifferences between the two classes\u201d justify the differential\ntreatment.Davis, 489 U.\u00a0S., at 814\u2013816 (1989)\n(internal quotation marks omitted);Phillips Chemical Co.,\n361 U.\u00a0S., at 383. Here, West Virginia expressly affords state\nlaw enforcement retirees a tax benefit that federal retirees cannot\nreceive. And before us everyone accepts the trial court\u2019s factual\nfinding that there aren\u2019t any \u201csignificant differences\u201d between Mr.\nDawson\u2019s former job responsibilities and those of the tax-exempt\nstate law enforcement retirees. Given all this, we have little\ndifficulty concluding that West Virginia\u2019s law unlawfully\n\u201cdiscriminate[s]\u201d against Mr. Dawson \u201cbecause of the source of\n[his] pay or compensation,\u201d just as \u00a7111 forbids.The State offers this ambitious rejoinder. Even\nif its statute favors some state law enforcement retirees, the\nfavored class is very small. Most state retirees are treated no\nbetter than Mr. Dawson. And this narrow preference, the State\nsuggests, should be permitted because it affects so few people that\nit couldn\u2019t meaningfully interfere with the operations of the\nfederal government.We are unpersuaded. Section 111 disallowsanystate tax that discriminates against a federal officer\nor employee\u2014not just those that seem to us especially cumbersome.\nNor are we inclined to accept West Virginia\u2019s invitation to adorn\n\u00a7111 with a new and judicially manufactured qualification that\ncannot be found in its text. In fact, we have already refused an\nalmost identical request. InDavis, we rejected Michigan\u2019s\nsuggestion that a discriminatory state income tax should be allowed\nto stand so long as it treats federal employees or retirees the\nsame as \u201cthe vast major- ity of voters in the State.\u201d 489\nU.\u00a0S., at 815, n.\u00a04. We rejected, too, any suggestion\nthat a discriminatory tax is permissible so long as it \u201cdoes not\ninterfere with the Federal Government\u2019s ability to perform its\ngovernmental functions.\u201dId., at 814. In fact, as long ago\nasMcCulloch, Chief Justice Marshall warned against\nenmeshing courts in the \u201cperplexing\u201d business, \u201cso unfit for the\njudicial department,\u201d of attempting to delineate \u201cwhat degree of\ntaxation is the legitimate use, and what degree may amount to the\nabuse of power.\u201d 4 Wheat., at 430.That\u2019s not to say the breadth or narrowness of a\nstate tax exemption is irrelevant. Under \u00a7111, the scope of a\nState\u2019s tax exemption may affect the scope of its resulting duties.\nSo if a State exempts from taxation all state employees, it must\nlikewise exempt all federal employees. Conversely, if the State\ndecides to exempt only a narrow subset of state retirees, the State\ncan comply with \u00a7111 by exempting only the comparable class of\nfederal retirees. But the narrowness of a discriminatory state tax\nlaw has never been enough to render it necessarily lawful.With its primary argument lost, the State now\nproceeds more modestly. Echoing the West Virginia Supreme Court of\nAppeals, the State argues that we should uphold its statute because\nit isn\u2019t intended to harm federal retirees, only to help certain\nstate retirees. But under the terms of \u00a7111, the \u201cState\u2019s interest\nin adopting the discriminatory tax, no matter how substantial, is\nsimply irrelevant.\u201dDavis, 489 U.\u00a0S., at 816. We can\nsafely assume that discriminatory laws like West Virginia\u2019s are\nalmost always enacted with the purpose of benefiting state\nemployees rather than harming their federal counterparts. Yet that\nwasn\u2019t enough to save the state statutes inDavis,Barker, orPhillips, and it can\u2019t be enough here.\nUnder \u00a7111 what matters isn\u2019t the intent lurking behind the law but\nwhether the letter of the law \u201ctreat[s] those who deal with\u201d the\nfederal government \u201cas well as it treats those with whom [the\nState] deals itself.\u201dPhillips Chemical Co., 361 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 385.If treatment rather than intent is what matters,\nthe State suggests that it should still prevail for other reasons.\nSection 111 prohibits \u201cdiscriminat[ion],\u201d something we\u2019ve often\ndescribed as treating similarly situated persons differently. SeeDavis, 489 U.\u00a0S., at 815\u2013816;Phillips Chemical\nCo., 361 U.\u00a0S., at 383. And before us West Virginia\ninsists that even if retired U.\u00a0S. Marshals and tax-exempt\nstate law enforcement retirees had similar job responsibilities,\nthey aren\u2019t \u201csimilarly situated\u201d for other reasons. Put another\nway, the State contends that the difference in treatment its law\ncommands doesn\u2019t qualify as unlawful discrimination because it is\n\u201cdirectly related to, and justified by,\u201d a lawful and \u201csignificant\ndifference\u201d between the two classes.Davis, 489 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 816 (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted).In approaching this argument, everyone before us\nagrees on at least one thing. Whether a State treats similarly\nsituated state and federal employees differently depends on how the\nState has defined the favored class. Seeid., at 817. So if\nthe State defines the favored class by reference to job\nresponsibilities, a similarly situated fed- eral worker will be one\nwho performs comparable duties. But if the State defines the class\nby reference to some other criteria, our attention should naturally\nturn there. If a State gives a tax benefit to all retirees over a\ncertain age, for example, the comparable federal retiree would be\nsomeone who is also over that age.So how has West Virginia chosen to define the\nfavored class in this case? The state statute singles out for\npreferential treatment retirement plans associated with West\nVirginia police, firefighters, and deputy sheriffs. See W. Va. Code\nAnn. \u00a711\u201321\u201312(c)(6) (Lexis 2017). The distinguishing\ncharacteristic of these plans is the nature of the jobs previously\nheld by retirees who may participate in them; thus, a similarly\nsituated federal retiree is someone who had similar job\nresponsibilities to a state police officer, firefighter, or deputy\nsheriff. The state trial court correctly focused on this point of\ncomparison and found no \u201csignificant differences\u201d between Mr.\nDawson\u2019s former job responsibilities as a U.\u00a0S. Marshal and\nthose of the state law enforcement retirees who qualify for the tax\nexemption. App. to Pet. for Cert. 22a. Nor did the West Virginia\nSupreme Court of Appeals upset this factual finding. So looking to\nhow the State has chosen to define its favored class only seems to\nconfirm that it has treated similarly situated persons differently\nbecause of the source of their compensation.Of course, West Virginia sees it otherwise. It\naccepts (for now) that its statute distinguishes between persons\nbased on their former job duties. It accepts, too, the trial\ncourt\u2019s finding that Mr. Dawson\u2019s former job responsibilities are\nmaterially identical to those of state retirees who qualify for its\ntax exemption. But, the State submits, Mr. Dawson\u2019s former job\nresponsibilities arealsosimilar to those of other state\nlaw enforcement retirees whodon\u2019tqualify for its tax\nexemption. And, the State insists, the fact that it treats federal\nretirees no worse than (some) similarly situated state employees\nshould be enough to save its statute.But this again mistakes the nature of our\ninquiry. Under \u00a7111, the relevant question isn\u2019t whether federal\nretirees are similarly situated to state retirees whodon\u2019treceive a tax benefit; the relevant question is whether they are\nsimilarly situated to those whodo.So, for example, inPhillipswe compared the class of federal lessees with thefavoredclass of state lessees, even though the State urged\nus to focus instead on the disfavored class of private lessees. 361\nU.\u00a0S., at 381\u2013382. InDavis, we likewise rejected the\nState\u2019s effort to compare the class of federal retirees with state\nresidents who did not benefit from the tax exemption rather than\nthose who did. See 489 U.\u00a0S., at 815, n.\u00a04.At this point the State is left to play its\nfinal card. Now, it says, maybe the real distinction its statute\ndraws isn\u2019t based on former job duties at all. Maybe its statute\nactually favors certain state law enforcement retirees only because\ntheir pensions are less generous than those of their federal law\nenforcement counterparts. At the least, the State suggests, we\nshould remand the case to the West Virginia courts to explore this\npossibility.The problem here is fundamental. While the State\nwas free to draw whatever classifications it wished, the statute it\nenacted does not classify persons or groups based on the relative\ngenerosity of their pension benefits. Instead, it extends a special\ntax benefit to retirees who served as West Virginia police\nofficers, firefighters, or deputy sheriffs\u2014and it categorically\ndenies that same benefit to retirees who served in similar federal\nlaw enforcement positions. Even if Mr. Dawson\u2019s pension turned out\nto beidenticalto a state law enforcement officer\u2019s\npension, the law as written would deny him a tax exemption. West\nVirginia\u2019s law thus discriminates \u201cbecause of the source of . . .\ncompensation or pay\u201d in violation of \u00a7111. Whether the unlawful\nclassification found in the text of a statute might serve as some\nsort of proxy for a lawful classification hidden behind it is\nneither here nor there. No more than a beneficent legislative\nintent, an implicit but lawful distinction cannot save an express\nand unlawful one.Our precedent confirms this too. InDavis, Michigan argued that a state law expressly\ndiscriminating between federal and state retirees was really just\ndistinguishing between those with more and less generous pensions.Id., at 816. We rejected this attempt to rerationalize the\nstatute, explaining that \u201c[a] tax exemption truly intended to\naccount for differences in retirement benefits would not\ndiscriminate on the basis of the source of those benefits\u201d but\n\u201cwould discriminate on the basis of the amount of benefits received\nby individual retirees.\u201dId., at 817. The fact is, when\nStates seek to tax the use of a fellow sovereign\u2019s property, the\nConstitution and Congress have always carefully constrained their\nauthority.Id., at 810\u2013814. And in this sensitive field it\nis not too much to ask that, if a Statewantsto draw a\ndistinction based on the generosity of pension benefits, it enact a\nlaw that actuallydoesthat.Because West Virginia\u2019s statute unlawfully\ndiscriminates against Mr. Dawson, we reverse the judgment of the\nWest Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals and remand the case for\nfurther proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion, including\nthe determination of an appropriate remedy.It is so ordered.",
