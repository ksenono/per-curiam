    "text": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES_________________No. 15\u20131498_________________JEFFERSON B. SESSIONS, III, ATTORNEY GENERAL,\nPETITIONERv.JAMES GARCIA DIMAYAon writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the ninth circuit[April 17, 2018]Chief Justice Roberts, with whom Justice\nKennedy, Justice Thomas, and Justice Alito join, dissenting.InJohnsonv.United States, we\nconcluded that the residual clause of the Armed Career Criminal Act\nwas unconstitutionally vague, given the \u201cindeterminacy of the\nwide-ranging inquiry\u201d it required. 576 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2015)\n(slip op., at 5). Today, the Court relies wholly onJohnson\u2014but only some ofJohnson\u2014to strike down\nanother provision, 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a716(b). Because \u00a716(b)\ndoes not give rise to the concerns that drove the Court\u2019s decision\ninJohnson, I respectfully dissent.IThe term \u201ccrime of violence\u201d appears\nrepeatedly throughout the Federal Criminal Code. Section 16 of\nTitle 18 defines it to mean:\u201c(a) an offense that has as an element the\nuse, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the\nperson or property of another, or\u201c(b) any other offense that is a felony and\nthat, by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical\nforce against the person or property of another may be used in the\ncourse of committing the offense.\u201dThis definition of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d is also\nincorporated in the definition of \u201caggravated felony\u201d in the\nImmigration and Nationality Act. 8\u00a0U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a71101(a)(43)(F) (\u201caggravated felony\u201d includes \u201ca crime of violence\n(as defined in section 16 of title 18, but not including a purely\npolitical offense) for which the term of imprisonment [is] at least\none year\u201d (footnote omitted)). A conviction for an aggravated\nfelony carries serious consequences under the immigration laws. It\ncan serve as the basis for an alien\u2019s removal from the United\nStates, and can preclude cancellation of removal by the Attorney\nGeneral. \u00a7\u00a71227(a)(2)(A)(iii), 1229b(a)(3).Those consequences came to pass in respondent\nJames Dimaya\u2019s case. An Immigration Judge and the Board of\nImmigration Appeals interpreted \u00a716(b) to cover Dimaya\u2019s two prior\nconvictions for first-degree residential burglary under California\nlaw, subjecting him to removal. To stave off that result, Dimaya\nargued that the language of \u00a716(b) was void for vagueness under the\nDue Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.The parties begin by disputing whether a\ncriminal or more relaxed civil vagueness standard should apply in\nresolving Dimaya\u2019s challenge. A plurality of the Court rejects the\nGovernment\u2019s argument in favor of a civil standard, because of the\n\u201cgrave nature of deportation,\u201dJordanv.De George,\n341 U.\u00a0S. 223, 231 (1951) ; seeante,at 6 (plurality\nopinion); Justice Gorsuch does so for broader reasons, seeante,at 10\u201315 (Gorsuch, J., concurring in part and\nconcurring in judgment). I see no need to resolve which standard\napplies, because I would hold that \u00a716(b) is not unconstitutionally\nvague even under the standard applicable to criminal laws.IIThis is not our first encounter with \u00a716(b).\nInLeocalv.Ashcroft, 543 U.\u00a0S. 1 (2004) , we\nwere asked to decide whether either subsection of \u00a716 covers a\nparticular category of state crimes, specifically DUI offenses\ninvolving no more than negligent conduct. 543 U.\u00a0S., at 6. Far\nfrom finding \u00a716(b) \u201chopeless[ly] indetermina[te],\u201dJohnson,\n576 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 7), we considered the\nprovision clear and unremarkable: \u201cwhile \u00a716(b) is broader than\n\u00a716(a) in the sense that physical force need not actually be\napplied,\u201d the provision \u201csimply covers offenses that naturally\ninvolve a person acting in disregard of the risk that physical\nforce might be used against another in committing an offense,\u201dLeocal, 543 U.\u00a0S., at 10\u201311. Applying that standard to\nthe state offense at issue, we concluded\u2014unanimously\u2014that \u00a716(b)\n\u201ccannot be read to include [a] conviction for DUI causing serious\nbodily injury under Florida law.\u201dId.,at 11.Leocalthus provides a model for how\ncourts should assess whether a particular crime \u201cby its nature\u201d\ninvolves a risk of the use of physical force. At the outset, our\nopinion set forth the elements of the Florida DUI statute, which\nmade it a felony \u201cfor a person to operate a vehicle while under the\ninfluence and, \u2018by reason of such operation, caus[e]\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. [s]erious bodily injury to another.\u2019\u00a0\u201d 543\nU.\u00a0S., at 7. Our \u00a716(b) analysis, in turn, focused on those\nspecific elements in concluding that a Florida offender\u2019s acts\nwould not naturally give rise to the requisite risk of force \u201cin\nthe course of committing the offense.\u201dId.,at 11. \u201cIn no\n\u2018ordinary or natural\u2019 sense,\u201d we explained, \u201ccan it be said that a\nperson risks having to \u2018use\u2019 physical force against another person\nin the course of operating a vehicle while intoxicated and causing\ninjury.\u201dIbid.The Court holds that the same provision we had\nno trouble applying inLeocalis in fact incapable of\nreasoned application. The sole justification for this turnabout is\nthe resemblance between the language of \u00a716(b) and the language of\nthe residual clause of the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA) that\nwas at issue inJohnson. The latter provision defined a\n\u201cviolent felony\u201d to include \u201cany crime punishable by imprisonment\nfor a term exceeding one year\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. that\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of\nexplosives,or otherwise involves conduct that presents a\nserious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d 18\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii) (emphasis added).InJohnson, we concluded that the ACCA\nresidual clause (the \u201cor otherwise\u201d language) gave rise to two\nforms of intractable uncertainty, which \u201cconspire[d]\u201d to render the\nprovision unconstitutionally vague. 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 5). First, the residual clause asked courts to gauge the\n\u201cpotential risk\u201d of \u201cphysical injury\u201d posed by the conduct involved\nin the crime.Ibid.That inquiry, we determined, entailed\nnot only an evaluation of the \u201ccriminal\u2019s behavior,\u201d but also\nrequired courts to consider \u201chow the idealized ordinary case of the\ncrime subsequently plays out.\u201dIbid.Second, the residual\nclause obligated courts to compare that risk to an indeterminate\nstandard\u2014one that was inextricably linked to the provision\u2019s four\nenumerated crimes, which presented differing kinds and degrees of\nrisk.Id.,at ___ (slip op., at 6). This murky confluence of\nfeatures, each of which \u201cmay [have been] tolerable in isolation,\u201d\ntogether \u201cma[de] a task for us which at best could be only\nguesswork.\u201dId.,at ___ (slip op., at 10).Section 16(b) does not present the same\nambiguities. The two provisions do correspond to some extent. Under\nour decisions, both ask the sentencing court to consider whether a\nparticular offense, defined without regard to the facts of the\nconviction, poses a specified risk. And, relevant to both statutes,\nwe have explained that in deciding whether statutory elements\ninherently produce a risk, a court must take into account how those\nelements will ordinarily be fulfilled. SeeJamesv.United States, 550 U.\u00a0S. 192, 208 (2007) (this\ncategorical inquiry asks \u201cwhether the conduct encompassed by the\nelements of the offense, in the ordinary case, presents\u201d the\nrequisite risk).[1] In the\nCourt\u2019s view, that effectively resolves this case. But the Court\ntoo readily dismisses the significant textual distinctions between\n\u00a716(b) and the ACCA residual clause. See alsoante,at 2\n(opinion of Gorsuch, J.). Those differences undermine the\nconclusion that \u00a716(b) shares each of the \u201cdual flaws\u201d of that\nclause.Ante,at 21 (majority opinion).To begin, \u00a716(b) yields far less uncertainty\n\u201cabout how to estimate the risk posed by a crime.\u201dJohnson,\n576 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 5). There are three material\ndifferences between \u00a716(b) and the ACCA residual clause in this\nrespect. First, the ACCA clause directed the reader to consider\nwhether the offender\u2019s conduct presented a \u201cpotentialrisk\u201d\nof injury. Forced to give meaning to that befuddling choice of\nphrase\u2014which layered one indeterminate term on top of another\u2014we\nunderstood the word \u201cpotential\u201d to signify that \u201cCongress intended\nto encompass possibilities even more contingent or remote than \u201ca\nsimple \u2018risk.\u2019\u00a0\u201dJames, 550 U.\u00a0S., at 207\u2013208. As\nwe explained inJohnson, that made for a \u201cspeculative\u201d\ninquiry \u201cdetached from statutory elements.\u201d 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___\n(slip op., at 5). In other words, the offense elements could not\nconstrain the risk inquiry in the manner they do here. SeeLeocal, 543 U.\u00a0S., at 11. The \u201cserious potential risk\u201d\nstandard also forced courts to assess in an expansive way the\n\u201ccollateral consequences\u201d of the perpetrator\u2019s acts. For example,\ncourts had to take into account the concern thatothersmight cause injury in attempting to apprehend the offender. SeeSykesv.United States, 564 U.\u00a0S. 1, 8 \u20139\n(2011). Section 16(b), on the other hand, asks about \u201crisk\u201d alone,\na familiar concept of everyday life. It therefore calls for a\ncommonsense inquiry that does not compel a court to venture beyond\nthe offense elements to consider contingent and remote\npossibilities.Second, \u00a716(b) focuses exclusively on the risk\nthat the offender will \u201cuse[ ]\u201d \u201cphysical force\u201d \u201cagainst\u201d another\nperson or another person\u2019s property. Thus, unlike the ACCA residual\nclause, \u201c\u00a716(b) plainly does not encompass all offenses which\ncreate a \u2018substantial risk\u2019 thatinjurywill result\nfroma person\u2019s conduct.\u201dLeocal,543 U.\u00a0S., at 10,\nn.\u00a07 (emphasis added). The point is not that an inquiry into\nthe risk of \u201cphysical force\u201d is markedly more determinate than an\ninquiry into the risk of \u201cphysical injury.\u201d But seeante,at\n19\u201320. The difference is that \u00a716(b) asks about the risk that the\noffender himself willactively employforce against person\nor property. That language does not sweep in all instances in which\nthe offender\u2019s acts, or another person\u2019s reaction, might result in\nunintended or negligent harm.Third, \u00a716(b) has a temporal limit that the ACCA\nresidual clause lacked: The \u201csubstantial risk\u201d of force must arise\n\u201cin the course of committing the offense.\u201d Properly interpreted,\nthis means the statute requires a substantial risk that the\nperpetrator will use force while carrying out the crime. SeeLeocal, 543 U.\u00a0S., at 10 (\u201cThe reckless disregard in\n\u00a716 relates\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. to the risk that the use of\nphysical force against another might be required in committing a\ncrime.\u201d). The provision thereby excludes more attenuated harms that\nmight arise following the completion of the crime. The ACCA\nresidual clause, by contrast, contained no similar language\nrestricting its scope. And the absence of such a limit, coupled\nwith the reference to \u201cpotential\u201d risks, gave courts free rein to\nclassify an offense as a violent felony based on injuries that\nmight occur after the offense was over and done. See,e.g.,\nUnited Statesv.Benton, 639 F.\u00a03d 723, 732 (CA6\n2011) (finding that \u201csolicitation to commit aggravated assault\u201d\nqualified under the ACCA residual clause on the theory that the\nsolicited individual might subsequently carry out the requested\nact).Why does any of this matter? Because it mattered\ninJohnson. More precisely, the expansive language in the\nACCA residual clause contributed to our determination that the\nclause gave rise to \u201cgrave uncertainty about how to estimate the\nrisk posed by a crime.\u201d 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 5).\n\u201cCritically,\u201d we said\u2014a word that tends to mean\nsomething\u2014\u201cpicturing the criminal\u2019s behavior is not enough.\u201dIbid.(emphasis added). Instead, measuring \u201cpotential risk\u201d\n\u201cseemingly require[d] the judge to imagine how the idealized\nordinary case of the crimesubsequently plays out.\u201dIbid.(emphasis added). Not so here. In applying \u00a716(b),\nconsidering\u201cthe criminal\u2019s behavior\u201disenough.Those three distinctions\u2014the unadorned reference\nto \u201crisk,\u201d the focus on the offender\u2019s own active employment of\nforce, and the \u201cin the course of committing\u201d limitation\u2014also mean\nthat many hard cases under ACCA are easier under \u00a716(b). Take the\nfirearm possession crime fromJohnsonitself, which had as\nits constituent elements (1)\u00a0unlawfully (2)\u00a0possessing\n(3) a short-barreled shotgun. None of those elements, \u201cby its\nnature,\u201d carries \u201ca substantial risk\u201d that the possessor will use\nforce against another \u201cin the course of committing the offense.\u201d\nNothing inherent in the act of firearm possession, even when it is\nunlawful, gives rise to a substantial risk that the owner will then\nshoot someone. SeeUnited Statesv.Serafin, 562\nF.\u00a03d 1105, 1113 (CA10 2009) (recognizing that \u201cLeocalinstructs [a court] to focus not on whether possession will likelyresultin violence, but instead whether one possessing an\nunregistered weapon necessarily risks the need to employ force to\ncommit possession\u201d).[2] Yet\nshort-barreled shotgun possession presented a closer question under\nthe ACCA residual clause, because the \u201cserious potential risk\u201d\nlanguage seemingly directed us to consider \u201cthe circumstances and\nconduct that ordinarily attend the offense,\u201d in addition to the\noffense itself.Johnson, 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (Alito, J.,\ndissenting) (slip op., at 17); seeid.,at ___\u2013___ (slip\nop., at 19\u201320) (reasoning that the crime must qualify because \u201ca\nperson who chooses to break the law and risk the heavy criminal\npenalty incurred by possessing a notoriously dangerous weapon is\n[likely] to use that weapon in violent ways\u201d).Failure to report to a penal institution, the\nsubject ofChambersv.United States, 555 U.\u00a0S.\n122 (2009) , is another crime \u201cwhose treatment becomes more obvious\nunder \u00a716(b) than under ACCA,\u201dante,at 18. InChambers, the Government argued that the requisite risk of\ninjury arises not necessarily at the time the offender fails to\nreport to prison, but instead later, when an officer attempts to\nrecapture the fugitive. 555 U.\u00a0S.,at 128. The majority\nis correct that we ultimately \u201creject[ed]\u201d the Government\u2019s\ncontention.Ante,at 18. But we did so after \u201cassum[ing] for\nargument\u2019s sake\u201d its premise\u2014that is, \u201cthe relevance of violence\nthat may occur long after an offender fails to report.\u201d 555\nU.\u00a0S., at 128; seeid.,at 129 (looking at 160 cases of\n\u201cfailure to report\u201d and observing that \u201cnone at all involved\nviolence\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. during the commission of the offense\nitself, [nor] during the offender\u2019s later apprehension\u201d). The \u201cin\nthe course of committing the offense\u201d language in \u00a716(b) helpfully\nforecloses that debate.DUI offenses are yet another example. Because\n\u00a716(b) asks about the risk that the offender will \u201cuse[ ]\u201d\n\u201cphysical force,\u201d we readily concluded inLeocalthat the\nsubsection does not cover offenses where the danger arises from the\noffender\u2019s negligent or accidental conduct, including drunk\ndriving. 543 U.\u00a0S., at 11. Applying the ACCA residual clause\nproved more trying. When asked to decide whether the clause covered\ndrunk driving offenses, a majority of the Court concluded that the\nanswer was no.Begayv.United States, 553 U.\u00a0S.\n137 (2008) . Our decision was based, however, on the inference that\nthe clause must cover only \u201cpurposeful, \u2018violent,\u2019 and \u2018aggressive\u2019\nconduct\u201d\u2014a test derived not from the \u201cconduct that presents a\nserious potential risk of physical injury\u201d language, but instead by\nreference to (what we guessed to be) the unifying characteristics\nof the enumerated offenses.Id.,at 144\u2013145. Four Members of\nthe Court criticized that test, seeid.,at 150\u2013153 (Scalia,\nJ., concurring in judgment);id.,at 158\u2013160, 162\u2013163\n(Alito, J., dissenting), though they themselves disagreed about\nwhether DUIs were covered, seeid.,at 153\u2013154 (opinion of\nScalia, J.);id.,at 156\u2013158 (opinion of Alito, J.). And the\nCourt distanced itself from theBegayrequirement only a few\nyears later when confronting the crime of vehicular flight. SeeSykes, 564 U.\u00a0S., at 12\u201313;Johnson, 576\nU.\u00a0S., at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 8\u20139).Which brings me to the second part of the\nCourt\u2019s analysis: its objection that \u00a716(b), like the ACCA residual\nclause, leaves \u201cuncertainty about the level of risk that makes a\ncrime \u2018violent.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAnte,at 10. The \u201csubstantial risk\u201d\nstandard in \u00a716(b) is significantly less confusing because it is\nnot tied to a disjointed list of paradigm offenses. Recall that the\nACCA provision defined a \u201cviolent felony\u201d to include a crime that\n\u201cis burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, orotherwiseinvolves conduct that presents a serious potential\nrisk of physical injury to another.\u201d 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii) (emphasis added). As our Court recognized early\non, that \u201cotherwise\u201d told the reader to understand the \u201cserious\npotential risk of physical injury\u201d standard by way of the four\nenumerated crimes.James, 550 U.\u00a0S., at 203. But how,\nexactly? That question dogged our residual clause cases for years,\nuntil we saidno m\u00e1sinJohnson.In our first foray,James, we resolved\nthe case by asking whether the risk posed by the crime of attempted\nburglary was \u201ccomparable to that posed by its closest analog among\nthe enumerated offenses,\u201d which was completed burglary. 550\nU.\u00a0S., at 203. While that rule \u201c[took] care of attempted\nburglary,\u201d it \u201coffer[ed] no help at all with respect to the vast\nmajority of offenses, which have no apparent analog among the\nenumerated crimes.\u201dJohnson, 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 7). TheJamesdissent, for its part, would have\ndetermined the requisite degree of risk from the least dangerous of\nthe enumerated crimes, and compared the offense to that. 550\nU.\u00a0S.,at 218\u2013219 (opinion of Scalia, J.). But that\napproach also proved to be harder than it sounded. Seeid.,at 219\u2013227.AfterJamescameBegay, in which\nwe concluded that the enumerated offenses served as an independent\nlimitation on thekindof crime that could qualify. 553\nU.\u00a0S., at 142; seeChambers, 555 U.\u00a0S., at 128\n(applying theBegaystandard). As discussed, that test was\nshort lived (though we did not purport to wholly repudiate it). SeeSykes, 564 U.\u00a0S., at 13. Finally, inSykes\u2014our\npenultimate residual clause case\u2014we acknowledged the prior use of\nthe closest-analog test inJames, but instead focused on\nwhether the risk posed by vehicular flight was \u201csimilar in degree\nof danger\u201d to the listed offenses of arson and burglary. 564\nU.\u00a0S., at 8\u201310. As a result, Justice Scalia\u2019s dissent\ncharacterized theSykesmajority as applying the test from\nhis prior dissent inJames, notJamesitself. See 564\nU.\u00a0S., at 29\u201330, 33. This series of precedents laid bare our\n\u201crepeated inability to craft a principled test out of the statutory\ntext,\u201did., at 34 (opinion of Scalia, J.), as the Court\nultimately acknowledged inJohnson, 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___\n(slip op., at 7).The enumerated offenses, and our Court\u2019s failed\nattempts to make sense of them, were essential toJohnson\u2019s\nconclusion that the residual clause \u201cleaves uncertainty about how\nmuch risk it takes for a crime to qualify as a violent felony.\u201dId.,at ___ (slip op., at 6). AsJohnsonexplained,\nthe issue was not that the statute employed a fuzzy standard. That\nkind of thing appears in the statute books all the time.Id.,at ___, ___ (slip op., at 6, 12). In the majority\u2019s\nretelling today, the difficulty inhered solely in the fact that the\nstatute paired such a standard with the ordinary case inquiry. Seeante,at 8, 10\u201311, 21. But that account sidesteps much ofJohnson\u2019s reasoning. See 576 U.\u00a0S.,at ___\u2013___,\n___, ___\u2013___, ___ (slip op., at 4\u20135, 6, 7\u20139, 12). Our opinion\nemphasized that the word \u201cotherwise\u201d \u201cforce[d]\u201d courts to interpret\nthe amorphous standard \u201cin light of\u201d the four enumerated crimes,\nwhich are \u201cnot much more similar to one another in kind than in\ndegree of risk posed.\u201dId.,at ___, ___ (slip op., at 6, 8).\nOr, asJohnsonput it more vividly, \u201c[t]he phrase \u2018shades of\nred,\u2019 standing alone, does not generate confusion or\nunpredictability; but the phrase \u2018fire-engine red, light pink,\nmaroon,navy blue, or colors that otherwise involve shades\nof red\u2019 assuredly does so.\u201dId.,at ___ (slip op., at 12).\nIndeed, the author ofJohnsonhad previously, and\nrepeatedly, described this feature of the residual clause as the\n\u201ccrucial\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. respect\u201d in which the law was\nproblematic. SeeJames, 550 U.\u00a0S., at 230, n.\u00a07\n(opinion of Scalia, J.);Sykes, 564 U.\u00a0S., at 35\n(opinion of Scalia, J.).With \u00a716(b), by contrast, a court need simply\nconsider the meaning of the word \u201csubstantial\u201d\u2014a word our Court has\ninterpreted and applied innumerable times across a wide variety of\ncontexts.[3] The court does not\nneed to give that familiar word content by reference to four\ndifferent offenses with varying amounts and kinds of risk.In its effort to recast a considerable portion\nofJohnsonas dicta, the majority speculates that if the\nenumerated offenses had truly mattered to the outcome, the Court\nwould have told lower courts to \u201cgive up on trying to interpret the\nclause by reference to\u201d those offenses, rather than striking down\nthe provision entirely.Ante,at 21. No litigant inJohnsonsuggested that solution, which is not surprising.\nSuch judicial redrafting could have expanded the reach of the\ncriminal provision\u2014surely a job for Congress alone.In any event, I doubt the majority\u2019s proposal\nwould have done the trick. And that is because the result inJohnsondid not follow from the presence of one frustrating\ntextual feature or another. Quite the opposite: The decision\nemphasized that it was the \u201csum\u201d of the \u201cuncertainties\u201d in the ACCA\nresidual clause, confirmed by years of experience, that\n\u201cconvince[d]\u201d us the provision was beyond salvage.Johnson,\n576 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 10). Those failings do not\ncharacterize the provision at issue here.IIIThe more constrained inquiry required under\n\u00a716(b)\u2014which asks only whether the offense elements naturally carry\nwith them a risk that the offender will use force in committing the\noffense\u2014does not itself engender \u201cgrave uncertainty about how to\nestimate the risk posed by a crime.\u201d And the provision\u2019s use of a\ncommonplace substantial risk standard\u2014one not tied to a list of\ncrimes that lack a unifying feature\u2014does not give rise to\nintolerable \u201cuncertainty about how much risk it takes for a crime\nto qualify.\u201d That should be enough to reject Dimaya\u2019s facial\nvagueness challenge.[4]Because I would rely on those distinctions to\nuphold \u00a716(b), the Court reproaches me for not giving sufficient\nweight to a \u201ccore insight\u201d ofJohnson.Ante,at 10,\nn.\u00a04; seeante,at 15 (opinion of Gorsuch, J.) (arguing\nthat \u00a716(b) runs afoul ofJohnson\u201cto the extent [\u00a716(b)]\nrequires an \u2018ordinary case\u2019 analysis\u201d). But the fact that the ACCA\nresidual clause required the ordinary case approach was not itself\nsufficient to doom the law. We instead took pains to clarify that\nour opinion should not be read to impart such an absolute rule. SeeJohnson, 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 10). I would\nadhere to that careful holding and not reflexively extend the\ndecision to a different statute whose reach is, on the whole, far\nmore clear.The Court does the opposite, and the\nramifications of that decision are significant. First, of course,\ntoday\u2019s holding invalidates a provision of the Immigration and\nNationality Act\u2014part of the definition of \u201caggravated felony\u201d\u2014on\nwhich the Government relies to \u201censure that dangerous criminal\naliens are removed from the United States.\u201d Brief for United States\n54. Contrary to the Court\u2019s back-of-the-envelope assessment, seeante,at 23, n.\u00a012, the Government explains that the\ndefinition is \u201ccritical\u201d for \u201cnumerous\u201d immigration provisions.\nBrief for United States 12.In addition, \u00a716 serves as the universal\ndefinition of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for all of Title 18 of the United\nStates Code. Its language is incorporated into many procedural and\nsubstantive provisions of criminal law, including provisions\nconcerning racketeering, money laundering, domestic violence, using\na child to commit a violent crime, and distributing information\nabout the making or use of explosives. See 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7\u00a725(a)(1), 842(p)(2), 1952(a), 1956(c)(7)(B)(ii), 1959(a)(4),\n2261(a), 3561(b). Of special concern, \u00a716 is replicated in the\ndefinition of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d applicable to \u00a7924(c), which\nprohibits using or carrying a firearm \u201cduring and in relation to\nany crime of violence,\u201d or possessing a firearm \u201cin furtherance of\nany such crime.\u201d \u00a7\u00a7924(c)(1)(A), (c)(3). Though I express no view\non whether \u00a7924(c) can be distinguished from the provision we\nconsider here, the Court\u2019s holding calls into question convictions\nunder what the Government warns us is an \u201coft-prosecuted offense.\u201d\nBrief for United States\u00a012.BecauseJohnsondoes not compel today\u2019s\nresult, I respectfully dissent.Notes1All this \u201cordinary case\u201d\ncaveat means is that while \u201c[o]ne can always hypothesize unusual\ncases in which even a prototypically violent crime might not\npresent a genuine risk,\u201d courts should exclude those atypical cases\nin assessing whether the offense qualifies.James, 550\nU.\u00a0S., at 208. As we have explained, under that approach, it\nis not the case that \u201cevery conceivable factual offense covered by\na statute\u201d must pose the requisite risk \u201cbefore the offense can be\ndeemed\u201d a crime of violence.Ibid.But the same is true of\nthe categorical approach generally. Seeibid.(using the\nterms just quoted to characterize both the ordinary case approach\nand the categorical approach for enumerated offenses set forth inTaylorv.United States, 495 U.\u00a0S. 575 (1990) );Moncrieffev.Holder, 569 U.\u00a0S. 184, 191 (2013)\n;Gonzalesv.Duenas-Alvarez, 549 U.\u00a0S. 183, 193\n(2007) .2The Court protests that\nthis straightforward analysis fails to take account of the crime\u2019s\nordinary case.Ante,at 18\u201319, n.\u00a06. But the fact that\nthe element of \u201cpossession\u201d may \u201ctake[ ] place in a variety of\nways\u201d\u2014for instance, one may possess a firearm \u201cin a closet, in a\nstoreroom, in a car, in a pocket,\u201d \u201cunloaded, disassembled, or\nlocked away,\u201dJohnson, 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (Thomas, J.,\nconcurring in judgment) (slip op., at 4)\u2014matters very little. That\nis because none of the alternative ways of satisfying that element\nproduce a substantial risk that the possessor will use physical\nforce against the person or property of another. And no one would\nsay that a person \u201cpossesses\u201d a gun by firing it or threatening\nsomeone with it. Cf.id.,at ___ (opinion of Thomas, J.)\n(slip op., at 5) (\u201c[T]he risk that the Government identifies arises\nnot from the act of possessing the weapon, but from the act of\nusing it.\u201d). The Court\u2019s insistence that this offense is\nnonetheless \u201cdifficult to classify\u201d under \u00a716(b),ante,at\n18, n.\u00a06, is surprising in light of our assessment, just two\nTerms ago, that \u00a716 does not cover \u201cfelon-in-possession laws and\nother firearms offenses,\u201dLuna Torresv.Lynch, 578\nU.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 13).3To name a round dozen:Ayestasv.Davis, 584 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2018)\n(slip op., at 16);Life Technologies Corp.v.Promega\nCorp., 580 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___\u2013___ (2017) (slip op., at 5\u20138);Virginiav.Hicks, 539 U.\u00a0S. 113, 119 \u2013120,\n122\u2013124 (2003);Toyota Motor Mfg., Ky., Inc.v.Williams, 534 U.\u00a0S. 184, 196 \u2013198 (2002);Slackv.McDaniel, 529 U.\u00a0S. 473, 483 \u2013484 (2000);Gentilev.State Bar of Nev., 501 U.\u00a0S. 1030,\n1075 \u20131076 (1991);Cagev.Louisiana, 498 U.\u00a0S.\n39, 41 (1990) (per curiam);Steadmanv.SEC,\n450 U.\u00a0S. 91, 98 (1981) ;Palermov.United\nStates, 360 U.\u00a0S. 343, 351 \u2013353 (1959);United\nStatesv.E.

Yet the Court does little to\nexplain how those alleged conflicts vindicate its particular\nconcern about the provision (namely, the ordinary case inquiry).\nAnd as the Government illustrates, many of those divergent results\nlikely can be chalked up to material differences in the state\noffense statutes at issue.
