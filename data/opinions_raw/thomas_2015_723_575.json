    "text": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES_________________No. 13\u2013983_________________ANTHONY DOUGLAS ELONIS, PETITIONERv.UNITED STATESon writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the third circuit[June 1, 2015]Justice Thomas, dissenting.We granted certiorari to resolve a conflict in\nthe lower courts over the appropriate mental state for threat\nprosecutions under 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7875(c). Save two, every\nCircuit to have considered the issue\u201411 in total\u2014has held that this\nprovision demands proof only of general intent, which here requires\nno more than that a defendant knew he transmitted a communication,\nknew the words used in that communication, and understood the\nordinary meaning of those words in the relevant context. The\noutliers are the Ninth and Tenth Circuits, which have concluded\nthat proof of an intent to threaten was necessary for conviction.\nAdopting the minority position, Elonis urges us to hold that\n\u00a7875(c) and the First Amendment require proof of an intent to\nthreaten. The Government in turn advocates a general-intent\napproach.Rather than resolve the conflict, the Court\ncasts aside the approach used in nine Circuits and leaves nothing\nin its place. Lower courts are thus left to guess at the\nappropriate mental state for \u00a7875(c). All they know after today\u2019s\ndecision is that a requirement of general intent will not do. But\nthey can safely infer that a majority of this Court would not adopt\nan intent-to-threaten requirement, as the opinion carefully leaves\nopen the possibility that recklessness may be enough. Seeante,at 16\u201317.This failure to decide throws everyone from\nappellate judges to everyday Facebook users into a state of\nuncertainty. This uncertainty could have been avoided had we simply\nadhered to the background rule of the common law favoring general\nintent. Although I am sympathetic to my colleagues\u2019 policy concerns\nabout the risks associated with threat prosecutions, the answer to\nsuch fears is not to discard our traditional approach to\nstate-of-mind requirements in criminal law. Because the Court of\nAppeals properly applied the general-intent standard, and because\nthe communications transmitted by Elonis were \u201ctrue threats\u201d\nunprotected by the First Amendment, I would affirm the judgment\nbelow.IAEnacted in 1939, \u00a7875(c) provides, \u201cWhoever\ntransmits in interstate or foreign commerce any communication\ncontaining any threat to kidnap any person or any threat to injure\nthe person of another, shall be fined under this title or\nimprisoned not more than five years, or both.\u201d Because \u00a7875(c)\ncriminalizes speech, the First Amendment requires that the term\n\u201cthreat\u201d be limited to a narrow class of historically unprotected\ncommunications called \u201ctrue threats.\u201d To qualify as a true threat,\na communication must be a serious expression of an intention to\ncommit unlawful physical violence, not merely \u201cpolitical\nhyperbole\u201d; \u201cvehement, caustic, and sometimes unpleasantly sharp\nattacks\u201d; or \u201cvituperative, abusive, and inexact\u201d statements.Wattsv.United States, 394 U.\u00a0S. 705, 708\n(1969) (per curiam) (internal quotation marks omitted). It\nalso cannot be determined solely by the reaction of the recipient,\nbut must instead be \u201cdetermined by the interpretation of areasonablerecipient familiar with the context of the\ncommunication,\u201dUnited Statesv.Darby, 37 F.\u00a03d\n1059, 1066 (CA4 1994) (emphasis added), lest historically protected\nspeech be suppressed at the will of an eggshell observer, cf.Coxv.Louisiana, 379 U.\u00a0S. 536, 551 (1965)\n(\u201c[C]onstitutional rights may not be denied simply because of\nhostility to their assertion or exercise\u201d (internal quotation marks\nomitted)). There is thus no dispute that, at a minimum, \u00a7875(c)\nrequires an objective showing: The communication must be one that\n\u201ca reasonable observer would construe as a true threat to another.\u201dUnited Statesv.Jeffries, 692 F.\u00a03d 473, 478\n(CA6 2012). And there is no dispute that the posts at issue here\nmeet that objective standard.The only dispute in this case is about the state\nof mind necessary to convict Elonis for making those posts. On its\nface, \u00a7875(c) does not demand any particular mental state. As the\nCourt correctly explains, the word \u201cthreat\u201d does not itself contain\namens rearequirement. Seeante,at 8\u20139. But because\nwe read criminal statutes \u201cin light of the background rules of the\ncommon law, in which the requirement of somemens reafor a\ncrime is firmly embedded,\u201d we require \u201csome indication of\ncongressional intent, express or implied, .\u00a0.\u00a0. to\ndispense withmens reaas an element of a crime.\u201dStaplesv.United States, 511 U.\u00a0S. 600 \u2013606\n(1994) (citation omitted). Absent such indicia, we ordinarily apply\nthe \u201cpresumption in favor of scienter\u201d to require only \u201cproof ofgeneral intent\u2014that is, that the defendant [must] posses[s]\nknowledge with respect to theactus reusof the crime.\u201dCarterv.United States, 530 U.\u00a0S. 255, 268\n(2000) .Under this \u201cconventionalmens reaelement,\u201d \u201cthe defendant [must] know the facts that make his\nconduct illegal,\u201dStaples, supra, at 605, but he need not\nknowthatthose facts make his conduct illegal. It has long\nbeen settled that \u201cthe knowledge requisite to knowing violation of\na statute is factual knowledge as distinguished from knowledge of\nthe law.\u201dBryanv.United States, 524 U.\u00a0S. 184,\n192 (1998) (internal quotation marks omitted). For instance, inPosters \u2018N\u2019 Things, Ltd.v.United States, 511\nU.\u00a0S. 513 (1994) , the Court addressed a conviction for\nselling drug paraphernalia under a statute forbidding anyone to\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018make use of the services of the Postal Service or other\ninterstate conveyance as part of a scheme to sell drug\nparaphernalia,\u2019\u00a0\u201did.,at 516 (quoting 21\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7857(a)(1) (1988 ed.)). In applying the\npresumption in favor of scienter, the Court concluded that\n\u201calthough the Government must establish that the defendant knew\nthat the items at issue are likely to be used with illegal drugs,\nit need not prove specific knowledge that the items are \u2018drug\nparaphernalia\u2019 within the meaning of the statute.\u201d 511\nU.\u00a0S.,at 524.Our default rule in favor of general intent\napplies with full force to criminal statutes addressing speech.\nWell over 100 years ago, this Court considered a conviction under a\nfederal obscenity statute that punished anyone \u201c\u00a0\u2018who shall\nknowingly deposit, or cause to be deposited, for mailing or\ndelivery,\u2019\u00a0\u201d any \u201c\u00a0\u2018obscene, lewd, or lascivious book,\npamphlet, picture, paper, writing, print, or other publication of\nan indecent character.\u2019\u00a0\u201dRosenv.United\nStates, 161 U.\u00a0S. 29, 30 (1896) (quoting Rev. Stat.\n\u00a73893). In that case, as here, the defendant argued that, even if\n\u201che may have had .\u00a0.\u00a0. actual knowledge or notice of [the\npaper\u2019s] contents\u201d when he put it in the mail, he could not \u201cbe\nconvicted of the offence .\u00a0. . unless he knew or believed that\nsuch paper could be properly or justly characterized as obscene,\nlewd, and lascivious.\u201d 161 U.\u00a0S.,at 41. The Court\nrejected that theory, concluding that if the material was actually\nobscene and \u201cdeposited in the mail by one who knew or had notice at\nthe time of its contents, the offence is complete, although the\ndefendant himself did not regard the paper as one that the statute\nforbade to be carried in the mails.\u201dIbid.As the Court\nexplained, \u201cCongress did not intend that the question as to the\ncharacter of the paper should depend upon the opinion or belief of\nthe person who, with knowledge or notice of [the paper\u2019s] contents,\nassumed the responsibility of putting it in the mails of the United\nStates,\u201d because \u201c[e]very one who uses the mails of the United\nStates for carrying papers or publications must take notice of\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. what must be deemed obscene, lewd, and lascivious.\u201dId.,at 41\u201342.This Court reaffirmedRosen\u2019s holding inHamlingv.United States, 418 U.\u00a0S. 87 (1974) ,\nwhen it considered a challenge to convictions under the successor\nfederal statute, seeid.,at 98, n.\u00a08 (citing 18\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71461 (1970 ed.)). Relying onRosen,the\nCourt rejected the argument that the statute required \u201cproof both\nof knowledge of the contents of the material and awareness of the\nobscene character of the material.\u201d 418 U.\u00a0S.,at 120\n(internal quotation marks omitted). In approving the jury\ninstruction that the defendants\u2019 \u201cbelief as to the obscenity or\nnon-obscenity of the material is irrelevant,\u201d the Court declined to\nhold \u201cthat the prosecution must prove a defendant\u2019s knowledge of\nthe legal status of the materials he distributes.\u201dId., at\n120\u2013121 (internal quotation marks omitted). To rule otherwise, the\nCourt observed, \u201cwould permit the defendant to avoid prosecution by\nsimply claiming that he had not brushed up on the law.\u201dId.,at 123.Decades before \u00a7875(c)\u2019s enactment, courts took\nthe same approach to the first federal threat statute, which\nprohibited threats against the President. In 1917, Congress enacted\na law punishing anyone\u201cwho knowingly and willfully deposits or\ncauses to be deposited for conveyance in the mail .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nany letter, paper, writing, print, missive, or document containing\nany threat to take the life of or to inflict bodily harm upon the\nPresident of the United States, or who knowingly and willfully\notherwise makes any such threat against the President.\u201d Act of Feb.\n14, 1917, ch. 64, 39Stat. 919.Courts applying this statute shortly after its\nenactment appeared to require proof of only general intent. InRaganskyv.United States, 253 F. 643 (CA7 1918), for\ninstance, a Court of Appeals held that \u201c[a] threat is knowingly\nmade, if the maker of it comprehends the meaning of the words\nuttered by him,\u201d and \u201cis willfully made, if in addition to\ncomprehending the meaning of his words, the maker voluntarily and\nintentionally utters them as the declaration of an apparent\ndetermination to carry them into execution,\u201did., at 645.\nThe court consequently rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that he\ncould not be convicted when his language \u201c[c]oncededly\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. constituted such a threat\u201d but was meant only \u201cas a\njoke.\u201dId.,at 644. Likewise, inUnited Statesv.Stobo, 251 F. 689 (Del. 1918), a District Court rejected the\ndefendant\u2019s objection that there was no allegation \u201cof any facts\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. indicating any intention .\u00a0.\u00a0. on the\npart of the defendant .\u00a0.\u00a0. to menace the President of\nthe United States,\u201did.,at 693 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). As it explained, the defendant \u201cis punishable under the\nact whether he uses the words lightly or with a set purpose to\nkill,\u201d as \u201c[t]he effect upon the minds of the hearers, who cannot\nread his inward thoughts, is precisely the same.\u201dIbid.At a\nminimum, there is no historical practice requiring more than\ngeneral intent when a statute regulates speech.BApplying ordinary rules of statutory\nconstruction, I would read \u00a7875(c) to require proof of general\nintent. To \u201cknow the facts that make his conduct illegal\u201d under\n\u00a7875(c), seeStaples,511 U.\u00a0S.,at 605, a\ndefendant must know that he transmitted a communication in\ninterstate or foreign commerce that contained a threat. Knowing\nthat the communication contains a \u201cthreat\u201d\u2014a serious expression of\nan intention to engage in unlawful physical violence\u2014does not,\nhowever, require knowing that a jury will conclude that the\ncommunication contains a threat as a matter of law. Instead, like\none who mails an \u201cobscene\u201d publication and is prosecuted under the\nfederal obscenity statute, a defendant prosecuted under \u00a7875(c)\nmust know only the words used in that communication, along with\ntheir ordinary meaning in context.General intent divides those who know the facts\nconstituting theactus reusof this crime from those who do\nnot. For example, someone who transmits a threat who does not know\nEnglish\u2014or who knows English, but perhaps does not know a\nthreatening idiom\u2014lacks the general intent required under \u00a7875(c).\nSeeRagansky,supra,at 645 (\u201c[A] foreigner, ignorant\nof the English language, repeating [threatening] words without\nknowledge of their meaning, may not knowingly have made a threat\u201d).\nLikewise, the hapless mailman who delivers a threatening letter,\nignorant of its contents, should not fear prosecution. A defendant\nlike Elonis, however, who admits that he \u201cknew that what [he] was\nsaying was violent\u201d but supposedly \u201cjust wanted to express\n[him]self,\u201d App. 205, acted with the general intent required under\n\u00a7875(c), even if he did not know that a jury would conclude that\nhis communication constituted a \u201cthreat\u201d as a matter of law.Demanding evidence only of general intent also\ncorresponds to \u00a7875(c)\u2019s statutory backdrop. As previously\ndiscussed, before the enactment of \u00a7875(c), courts had read the\nPresidential threats statute to require proof only of general\nintent. Given Congress\u2019 presumptive awareness of this application\nof the Presidential threats statute\u2014not to mention this Court\u2019s\nsimilar approach in the obscenity context, seeRosen, 161\nU.\u00a0S.,at 41\u201342\u2014it is difficult to conclude that the\nCongress that enacted \u00a7875(c) in 1939 understood it to contain an\nimplicit mental-state requirement apart from general intent. There\nis certainly no textual evidence to support this conclusion. If\nanything, the text supports the opposite inference, as \u00a7875(c),\nunlike the Presidential threats statute, contains no reference to\nknowledge or willfulness. Nothing in the statute suggests that\nCongress departed from the \u201cconventionalmens reaelement\u201d\nof general intent,Staples,supra,at 605; I would\nnot impose a higher mental-state requirement here.CThe majority refuses to apply these ordinary\nbackground principles. Instead, it casts my application of general\nintent as a negligence standard disfavored in the criminal law.Ante,at 13\u201316. But that characterization misses the mark.\nRequiring general intent in this context is not the same as\nrequiring mere negligence. Like the mental-state requirements\nadopted in many of the cases cited by the Court, general intent\nunder \u00a7875(c) prevents a defendant from being convicted on the\nbasis of anyfactbeyond his awareness. See,e.g.,United Statesv.X-Citement Video, Inc., 513\nU.\u00a0S. 64, 73 (1994) (knowledge of age of persons depicted in\nexplicit materials);Staples,supra,at 614\u2013615\n(knowledge of firing capability of weapon);Morissettev.United States, 342 U.\u00a0S. 246 \u2013271 (1952) (knowledge\nthat property belonged to another). In other words, the defendant\nmustknow\u2014not merely be reckless or negligent with respect\nto the fact\u2014that he is committing the acts that constitute theactus reusof the offense.But general intent requiresnomental\nstate (not even a negligent one) concerning the \u201cfact\u201d that certain\nwords meet thelegaldefinition of a threat. That approach\nis particularly appropriate where, as here, that legal status is\ndetermined by a jury\u2019s application of the legal standard of a\n\u201cthreat\u201d to the contents of a communication. And convicting a\ndefendant despite his ignorance of the legal\u2014or objective\u2014status of\nhis conduct does not mean that he is being punished for negligent\nconduct. By way of example, a defendant who is convicted of murder\ndespite claiming that he acted in self-defense has not been\npenalized under a negligence standard merely because he does not\nknow that the jury will reject his argument that his \u201cbelief in the\nnecessity of using force to prevent harm to himself [was] a\nreasonable one.\u201d See 2 W. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law\n\u00a710.4(c), p. 147 (2d ed. 2003).The Court apparently does not believe that our\ntraditional approach to the federal obscenity statute involved a\nnegligence standard. It asserts thatHamling\u201capproved a\nstate court\u2019s conclusion that requiring a defendant to know the\ncharacter of the material incorporated a \u2018vital element of\nscienter\u2019 so that \u2018not innocent butcalculated purveyanceof\nfilth .\u00a0.\u00a0. is exorcised.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAnte,at 15\n(quotingHamling, 418 U.\u00a0S.,at 122 (in turn\nquotingMishkinv.New York, 383 U.\u00a0S. 502, 510\n(1966) ). According to the Court, the mental state approved inHamlingthus \u201cturns on whether a defendant knew thecharacterof what was sent, not simply its contents and\ncontext.\u201dAnte,at 15. It is unclear what the Court means by\nits distinction between \u201ccharacter\u201d and \u201ccontents and context.\u201d\n\u201cCharacter\u201d cannot meanlegalobscenity, asHamlingrejected the argument that a defendant must have \u201cawareness of the\nobscene character of the material.\u201d 418 U.\u00a0S., at 120\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Moreover, this discussion was\nnot part ofHamling\u2019s holding, which was primarily a\nreaffirmation ofRosen. See 418 U.\u00a0S.,at\n120\u2013121; see alsoPosters \u2019N\u2019 Things, 511 U.\u00a0S.,at 524\u2013525 (characterizingHamlingas holding that a\n\u201cstatute prohibiting mailing of obscene materials does not require\nproof that [the] defendant knew the materials at issue met the\nlegal definition of \u2018obscenity\u2019\u00a0\u201d).The majority\u2019s treatment ofRosenis even\nless persuasive. To shore up its position, it asserts that the\ncritical portion ofRosenrejected an \u201c\u00a0\u2018ignorance of\nthe law\u2019 defense,\u201d and claims that \u201cno such contention is at issue\nhere.\u201dAnte,at 15. But the thrust of Elonis\u2019 challenge is\nthat a \u00a7875(c) conviction cannot stand if the defendant\u2019s\nsubjective belief of what constitutes a \u201cthreat\u201d differs from that\nof a reasonable jury. That is akin to the argument the defendant\nmade\u2014and lost\u2014inRosen. That defendant insisted that he\ncould not be convicted for mailing the paper \u201cunless he knew or\nbelieved that such paper could be properly or justly characterized\nas obscene.\u201d 161 U.\u00a0S., at 41. The Court, however, held that\nthe Government did not need to show that the defendant \u201cregard[ed]\nthe paper as one that the statute forbade to be carried in the\nmails,\u201d because the obscene character of the material did not\n\u201cdepend upon the opinion or belief of the person who\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. assumed the responsibility of putting it in the\nmails.\u201dIbid.The majority\u2019s muddying of the waters cannot\nobscure the fact that today\u2019s decision is irreconcilable withRosenandHamling.DThe majority today at least refrains from\nrequiring an intent to threaten for \u00a7875(c) convictions, as Elonis\nasks us to do. Elonis contends that proof of a defendant\u2019s intent\nto put the recipient of a threat in fear is necessary for\nconviction, but that element cannot be found within the statutory\ntext. \u201c[W]e ordinarily resist reading words or elements into a\nstatute that do not appear on its face,\u201d including elements similar\nto the one Elonis proposes.E.g., Batesv.United\nStates, 522 U.\u00a0S. 23, 29 (1997) (declining to read an\n\u201cintent to defraud\u201d element into a criminal statute). As the\nmajority correctly explains, nothing in the text of \u00a7875(c) itself\nrequires proof of an intent to threaten. Seeante,at 8\u20139.\nThe absence of such a requirement is significant, as Congress knows\nhow to require a heightenedmens reain the context of\nthreat offenses. See \u00a7875(b) (providing for the punishment of\n\u201c[w]hoever, with intent to extort .\u00a0.\u00a0. , transmits in\ninterstate or foreign commerce any communication containing any\nthreat to kidnap any person or any threat to injure the person of\nanother\u201d); see also \u00a7119 (providing for the punishment of\n\u201c[w]hoever knowingly makes restricted personal information about\n[certain officials] .\u00a0.\u00a0. publicly available\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. with the intent to threaten\u201d).Elonis nonetheless suggests that an\nintent-to-threaten element is necessary in order to avoid the risk\nof punishing innocent conduct. But there is nothing absurd about\npunishing an individual who, with knowledge of the words he uses\nand their ordinary meaning in context, makes a threat. For\ninstance, a high-school student who sends a letter to his principal\nstating that he will massacre his classmates with a machine gun,\neven if he intended the letter as a joke, cannot fairly be\ndescribed as engaging in innocent conduct. But seeante,at\n4\u20135, 16 (concluding that Elonis\u2019 conviction under \u00a7875(c) for\ndiscussing a plan to \u201c\u00a0\u2018initiate the most heinous school\nshooting ever imagined\u2019\u00a0\u201d against \u201c\u00a0\u2018a Kindergarten\nclass\u2019\u00a0\u201d cannot stand without proof of some unspecified\nheightened mental state).Elonis also insists that we read an\nintent-to-threaten element into \u00a7875(c) in light of the First\nAmendment. But our practice of construing statutes \u201cto avoid\nconstitutional questions .\u00a0.\u00a0. is not a license for the\njudiciary to rewrite language enacted by the legislature,\u201dSalinasv.United States, 522 U.\u00a0S. 52 \u201360\n(1997) (internal quotation marks omitted), and ordinary background\nprinciples of criminal law do not support rewriting \u00a7875(c) to\ninclude an intent-to-threaten requirement. We have not altered our\ntraditional approach tomens reafor other constitutional\nprovisions. See,e.g., Deanv.United States, 556\nU.\u00a0S. 568 \u2013574 (2009) (refusing to read an\nintent-to-discharge-the-firearm element into a mandatory minimum\nprovision concerning the discharge of a firearm during a particular\ncrime). The First Amendment should be treated no differently.IIIn light of my conclusion that Elonis was\nproperly convicted under the requirements of \u00a7875(c), I must\naddress his argument that his threatening posts were nevertheless\nprotected by the First Amendment.AElonis does not contend that threats are\nconstitutionally protected speech, nor could he: \u201cFrom 1791 to the\npresent, .\u00a0.\u00a0. our society .\u00a0.\u00a0. has permitted\nrestrictions upon the content of speech in a few limited areas,\u201d\ntrue threats being one of them.R. A. V.v.St. Paul,\n505 U.\u00a0S. 377 \u2013383 (1992); seeid.,at 388. Instead,\nElonis claims that onlyintentionalthreats fall within this\nparticular historical exception.If it were clear that intentional threats alone\nhave been punished in our Nation since 1791, I would be inclined to\nagree. But that is the not the case. Although the Federal\nGovernment apparently did not get into the business of regulating\nthreats until 1917, the States have been doing so since the late\n18th and early 19th centuries. See,e.g.,1795 N.\u00a0J.\nLaws p. 108; Ill. Rev. Code of Laws, Crim. Code \u00a7108 (1827) (1827\nIll. Crim. Code); 1832 Fla. Laws pp. 68\u201369. And that practice\ncontinued even after the States amended their constitutions to\ninclude speech protections similar to those in the First Amendment.\nSee,e.g.,Fla.

Hood, Index of\nColonial and State Laws of New Jersey 1203, 1235, 1257, 1265\n(1905); 1 Ill. Stat., ch. 30, div. 9, \u00a731 (3d ed. 1873). State\npractice thus provides at least some evidence of the original\nmeaning of the phrase \u201cfreedom of speech\u201d in the First Amendment.\nSeeRothv.United States, 354 U.\u00a0S. 476 \u2013483\n(1957) (engaging in a similar inquiry with respect to\nobscenity).Shortly after the founding, several States and\nTerritories enacted laws making it a crime to \u201cknowingly send or\ndeliver any letter or writing, with or without a name subscribed\nthereto, or signed with a fictitious name, .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nthreatening to maim, wound, kill or murder any person, or to burn\nhis or her [property], though no money, goods or chattels, or other\nvaluable thing shall be demanded,\u201de.g.,1795 N.\u00a0J.\nLaws \u00a757, at 108; see also,e.g.,1816 Ga. Laws p. 178; 1816\nMich. Territory Laws p. 128; 1827 Ill. Crim. Code \u00a7108; 1832 Fla.\nLaws, at 68\u201369. These laws appear to be the closest early analogue\nto \u00a7875(c), as they penalize transmitting a communication\ncontaining a threat without proof of a demand to extort something\nfrom the victim. Threat provisions explicitly requiring proof of a\nspecific \u201cintent to extort\u201d appeared alongside these laws, see,e.g.,1795 N.\u00a0J. Laws \u00a757, at 108, but those provisions\nare simply the predecessors to \u00a7875(b) and \u00a7875(d), which likewise\nexpressly contain an intent-to-extort requirement.The laws without that extortion requirement were\ncopies of a 1754 English threat statute subject to only a\ngeneral-intent requirement. The statute made it a capital offense\nto \u201cknowingly send any Letter without any Name subscribed thereto,\nor signed with a fictitious Name .\u00a0.\u00a0. threatening to\nkill or murder any of his Majesty\u2019s Subject or Subjects, or to burn\ntheir [property], though no Money or Venison or other valuable\nThing shall be demanded.\u201d 27 Geo. II, ch. 15, in 7 Eng. Stat. at\nLarge 61 (1754); see also 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws\nof England 144 (1768) (describing this statute). Early English\ndecisions applying this threat statute indicated that the\nappropriate mental state was general intent. InKingv.Girdwood, 1 Leach 142, 168 Eng. Rep. 173 (K. B. 1776), for\nexample, the trial court instructed the jurors that, \u201cif they were\nof opinion that\u201d the \u201cterms of the letter conveyed an actual threat\nto kill or murder,\u201d \u201cand that the prisoner knew the contents of it,\nthey ought to find him guilty; but that if they thought he did not\nknow the contents, or that the words might import any thing less\nthan to kill or murder, they ought to acquit,\u201did.,at 143,\n168 Eng. Rep., at 173. On appeal following conviction, the judges\n\u201cthought that the case had been properly left to the Jury.\u201dIbid., 168 Eng. Rep., at 174. Other cases likewise appeared\nto consider only the import of the letter\u2019s language, not the\nintent of its sender. See,e.g.,Rexv.Boucher, 4 Car. & P. 562, 563, 172 Eng. Rep. 826, 827\n(K. B. 1831) (concluding that an indictment was sufficient because\n\u201cth[e] letter very plainly conveys a threat to kill and murder\u201d and\n\u201c[n]o one who received it could have any doubt as to what the\nwriter meant to threaten\u201d); see also 2 E. East, A Treatise of the\nPleas of the Crown 1116 (1806) (discussingJepsonand\nSpringett\u2019s Case, in which the judges disagreed over whether\n\u201cthe letter must be understood as .\u00a0.\u00a0. importing a\nthreat\u201d and whether that was \u201ca necessary construction\u201d).Unsurprisingly, these early English cases were\nwell known in the legal world of the 19th century United States.\nFor instance, Nathan Dane\u2019s A General Abridgement of American\nLaw\u2014\u201ca necessary adjunct to the library of every American lawyer of\ndistinction,\u201d 1 C. Warren, History of the Harvard Law School and of\nEarly Legal Conditions in America 414 (1908)\u2014discussed the English\nthreat statute and summarized decisions such asGirdwood. 7\nN. Dane, A General Abridgement of American Law 31\u201332 (1824). And as\nthis Court long ago recognized, \u201cIt is doubtless true\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. that where English statutes .\u00a0.\u00a0. have\nbeen adopted into our own legislation; the known and settled\nconstruction of those statutes by courts of law, has been\nconsidered as silently incorporated into the acts, or has been\nreceived with all the weight of authority.\u201dPennockv.Dialogue, 2 Pet. 1, 18 (1829); see also,e.g.,\nCommonwealthv.Burdick, 2 Pa. 163, 164 (1846)\n(considering English cases persuasive authority in interpreting\nsimilar state statute creating the offense of obtaining property\nthrough false pretenses). In short, there is good reason to believe\nthat States bound by their own Constitutions to protect freedom of\nspeech long ago enacted general-intent threat statutes.Elonis disputes this historical analysis on two\ngrounds, but neither is persuasive. He first points to a treatise\nstating that the 1754 English statute was \u201clevelled against such\nwhose intention it was, (by writing such letters, either without\nnames or in fictitious names,) to conceal themselves from the\nknowledge of the party threatened, that they might obtain their\nobject by creating terror in [the victim\u2019s] mind.\u201d 2 W. Russell\n& D. Davis, A Treatise on Crimes & Misdemeanors 1845 (1st\nAm. ed. 1824). But the fact that the ordinary prosecution under\nthis provision involved a defendant who intended to cause fear does\nnot mean that such a mental state wasrequiredas a matter\nof law. After all, \u00a7875(c) is frequently deployed against people\nwho wanted to cause their victims fear, but that fact does not\nanswer the legal question presented in this case. See,e.g.,\nUnited Statesv.Sutcliffe, 505 F.\u00a03d 944, 952 (CA9\n2007); see also Tr. of Oral Arg. 53 (counsel for the Government\nnoting that \u201cI think Congress would well have understood that the\nmajority of these cases probably [involved] people who intended to\nthreaten\u201d).Elonis also cobbles together an assortment of\nolder American authorities to prove his point, but they fail to\nstand up to close scrutiny. Two of his cases address the offense of\nbreaching the peace,Warev.Loveridge, 75 Mich. 488,\n490\u2013493, 42 N.\u00a0W. 997, 998 (1889);Statev.Benedict, 11 Vt. 236, 239 (1839), which is insufficiently\nsimilar to the offense criminalized in \u00a7875(c) to be of much use.\nAnother involves a prosecution under a blackmailing statute similar\nto \u00a7875(b) and \u00a7875(c) in that it expressly required an \u201cintent to\nextort.\u201dNorrisv.State, 95 Ind. 73, 74 (1884). And\nhis treatises do not clearly distinguish between the offense of\nmaking threats with the intent to extort and the offense of sending\nthreatening letters without such a requirement in their discussions\nof threat statutes, making it difficult to draw strong inferences\nabout the latter category. See 2 J. Bishop, Commentaries on the\nCriminal Law \u00a71201, p. 664, and nn. 5\u20136 (1877); 2 J. Bishop,\nCommentaries on the Law of Criminal Procedure \u00a7975, p. 546 (1866);\n25 The American and English Encyclop\u00e6dia of Law 1073 (C. Williams\ned. 1894).Two of Elonis\u2019 cases appear to discuss an\noffense of sending a threatening letter without an intent to\nextort, but even these fail to make his point. One notes in passing\nthat character evidence is admissible \u201cto proveguilty\nknowledgeof the defendant, when that is an essential element\nof the crime; that is, thequo animo, theintentor\ndesign,\u201d and offers as an example that in the context of \u201csending a\nthreatening letter, .\u00a0.\u00a0. prior and subsequent letters to\nthe same person are competent in order to show the intent and\nmeaning of the particular letter in question.\u201dStatev.Graham, 121 N.\u00a0C. 623, 627, 28 S.\u00a0E. 409, 409\n(1897). But it is unclear from that statement whether that court\nthought anintent to threatenwas required, especially as\nthe case it cited for this proposition\u2014Rexv.Boucher, 4 Car. & P. 562, 563, 172 Eng. Rep. 826, 827\n(K.\u00a0B. 1831)\u2014supports a general-intent approach. The other\ncase Elonis cites involves a statutory provision that had been\njudicially limited to \u201c\u00a0\u2018pertain to one or the other acts\nwhich are denounced by the statute,\u2019\u00a0\u201d namely, terroristic\nactivities carried out by the Ku Klux Klan.Commonwealthv.Morton, 140 Ky. 628, 630, 131 S.\u00a0W. 506, 507 (1910)\n(quotingCommonwealthv.Patrick, 127 Ky. 473, 478,\n105 S.\u00a0W. 981, 982 (1907)). That case thus provides scant\nhistorical support for Elonis\u2019 position.BElonis also insists that our precedents\nrequire a mental state of intent when it comes to threat\nprosecutions under \u00a7875(c), primarily relying onWatts, 394\nU.\u00a0S. 705 , andVirginiav.Black, 538\nU.\u00a0S. 343 (2003) . Neither of those decisions, however,\naddresses whether the First Amendment requires a particular mental\nstate for threat prosecutions.As Elonis admits,Wattsexpressly\ndeclined to address the mental state required under the First\nAmendment for a \u201ctrue threat.\u201d See 394 U.\u00a0S., at 707\u2013708.\nTrue, the Court inWattsnoted \u201cgrave doubts\u201d aboutRaganksy\u2019s construction of \u201cwillfully\u201d in the presidential\nthreats statute. 394 U.\u00a0S., at 707\u2013708.But \u201cgrave\ndoubts\u201d do not make a holding, and that stray statement inWattsis entitled to no precedential force. If anything,Wattscontinued the long tradition of focusing on objective\ncriteria in evaluating the mental requirement. Seeibid.The Court\u2019s fractured opinion inBlacklikewise says little about whether an intent-to-threaten\nrequirement is constitutionally mandated here.Blackconcerned a Virginia cross-burning law that expressly required\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018an intent to intimidate a person or group of\npersons,\u2019\u00a0\u201d 538 U.\u00a0S., at 347 (quoting Va. Code Ann.\n\u00a718.2\u2013423 (1996)), and the Court thus had no occasion to decide\nwhether such an element was necessary in threat provisions silent\non the matter. Moreover, the focus of theBlackdecision was\non the statutory presumption that \u201cany cross burning [w]as prima\nfacie evidence of intent to intimidate.\u201d 538 U.\u00a0S.,at\n347\u2013348. A majority of the Court concluded that this presumption\nfailed to distinguish unprotected threats from protected speech\nbecause it might allow convictions \u201cbased solely on the fact of\ncross burning itself,\u201d including cross burnings in a play or at a\npolitical rally.Id.,at 365\u2013366 (plurality opinion);id.,at 386 (Souter, J., concurring in judgment in part and\ndissenting in part) (\u201cThe provision will thus tend to draw\nnonthreatening ideological expression within the ambit of the\nprohibition of intimidating expression\u201d). The objective standard\nfor threats under \u00a7875(c), however, helps to avoid this problem by\n\u201cforc[ing] jurors to examine the circumstances in which a statement\nis made.\u201dJeffries, 692 F. 3d,at 480.In addition to requiring a departure from our\nprecedents, adopting Elonis\u2019 view would make threats one of the\nmost protected categories of unprotected speech, thereby sowing\ntension throughout our First Amendment doctrine. We generally have\nnot required a heightened mental state under the First Amendment\nfor historically unprotected categories of speech. For instance,\nthe Court has indicated that a legislature may constitutionally\nprohibit \u201c\u00a0\u2018fighting words,\u2019 those personally abusive epithets\nwhich, when addressed to the ordinary citizen, are, as a matter of\ncommon knowledge, inherently likely to provoke violent reaction,\u201dCohenv.California, 403 U.\u00a0S. 15, 20 (1971)\n\u2014without proof of an intent to provoke a violent reaction. Because\nthe definition of \u201cfighting words\u201d turns on how the \u201cordinary\ncitizen\u201d would react to the language,ibid., this Court has\nobserved that a defendant may be guilty of a breach of the peace if\nhe \u201cmakes statements likely to provoke violence and disturbance of\ngood order, even though no such eventuality be intended,\u201d and that\nthe punishment of such statements \u201cas a criminal act would raise no\nquestion under [the Constitution],\u201dCantwellv.Connecticut, 310 U.\u00a0S. 296 \u2013310 (1940); see alsoChaplinskyv.New Hampshire, 315 U.\u00a0S. 568 \u2013573\n(1942) (rejecting a First Amendment challenge to a general-intent\nconstruction of a state statute punishing \u201c\u00a0\u2018fighting\u2019\nwords\u201d);Statev.Chaplinsky, 91 N.\u00a0H. 310, 318,\n18 A.\u00a02d 754, 758 (1941) (\u201c[T]he only intent required for\nconviction .\u00a0.\u00a0. was an intent to speak the words\u201d). The\nCourt has similarly held that a defendant may be convicted of\nmailing obscenity under the First Amendment with-out proof that he\nknew the materials were legally obscene.Hamling,418\nU.\u00a0S.,at 120\u2013124. And our precedents allow liability\nin tort for false statements about private persons on matters of\nprivate concern even if the speaker acted negligently with respect\nto the falsity of those statements. SeePhiladelphia Newspapers,\nInc.v.Hepps, 475 U.\u00a0S. 767 \u2013775 (1986). I see no\nreason why we should give threats pride of place among unprotected\nspeech.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*There is always a risk that a criminal threat\nstatute may be deployed by the Government to suppress legitimate\nspeech. But the proper response to that risk is to adhere to our\ntraditional rule that only a narrow class of true threats,\nhistorically unprotected, may be constitutionally proscribed.The solution is not to abandon a mental-state\nrequirement compelled by text, history, and precedent. Not only\ndoes such a decision warp our traditional approach tomens\nrea, it results in an arbitrary distinction between threats and\nother forms of unprotected speech. Had Elonis mailed obscene\nmaterials to his wife and a kindergarten class, he could have been\nprosecuted irrespective of whether he intended to offend those\nrecipients or reck-lessly disregarded that possibility. Yet when he\nthreatened to kill his wife and a kindergarten class, his intent to\nterrify those recipients (or reckless disregard of that risk)\nsuddenly becomes highly relevant. That need not\u2014and should not\u2014be\nthe case.Nor should it be the case that we cast aside the\nmental-state requirement compelled by our precedents yet offer\nnothing in its place. Our job is to decide questions, not create\nthem. Given the majority\u2019s ostensible concern for protecting\ninnocent actors, one would have expected it to announce a clear\nrule\u2014any clear rule. Its failure to do so reveals the fractured\nfoundation upon which today\u2019s decision rests.I respectfully dissent.",
