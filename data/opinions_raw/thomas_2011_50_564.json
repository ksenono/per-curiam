S. ____ (2011)SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESNOS. 10-313 AND 10-329TALK AMERICA, INC., PETITIONER10\u2013313v.MICHIGAN BELL TELEPHONE COMPANY dbaAT&T MICHIGANORJIAKOR ISIOGU, et\u00a0al., PETITIONERS10\u2013329v.MICHIGAN BELL TELEPHONE COMPANY dbaAT&T MICHIGANon writs of certiorari to the united states court\nof appeals for the sixth circuit[June 9, 2011]Justice Thomas delivered the\nopinion of the Court.In these cases, we consider\nwhether an incumbent provider of local telephone service must make\ncertain transmission facilities available to competitors at\ncost-based rates. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC or\nCommission) asamicus curiae[Footnote 1]contends that its regulations require the\nincumbent provider to do so if the facilities are to be used for\ninterconnection: to link the incumbent provider\u2019s telephone network\nwith the competitor\u2019s network for the mutual exchange of traffic.\nWe defer to the Commission\u2019s views and reverse the judgment\nbelow.IThe Telecommunications Act of\n1996 (1996 Act), 110 Stat. 56, imposed a number of duties on\nincumbent providers of local telephone service in order to\nfacilitate market entry by competitors.AT&T Corp.v.Iowa Utilities Bd.,525 U. S. 366, 371\n(1999). The incumbent local ex-change carriers (LECs) owned the\nlocal exchange networks: the physical equipment necessary to\nreceive, properly route, and deliver phone calls among customers.Verizon Communications Inc.v.FCC,535 U. S. 467, 490\n(2002). Before the 1996 Act, a new, competitive LEC could not\ncompete with an incumbent carrier without basically replicating the\nincumbent\u2019s entire existing network.Ibid.The 1996 Act addressed that\nbarrier to market entry by requiring incumbent LECs to share their\nnetworks with competitive LECs in several ways, two of which are\nrelevant here. First, 47 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7251(c)(3) requires\nincumbent LECs to lease \u201con an unbundled basis\u201d\u2014i.e., a la\ncarte\u2014network elements specified by the Commission. This makes it\neasier for a competitor to create its own network without having to\nbuild every element from scratch. In identifying which network\nelements must be available for unbundled lease under \u00a7251(c)(3),\nthe Commission is required to consider whether access is\n\u201cnecessary\u201d and whether failing to provide access would \u201cimpair\u201d a\ncompetitor\u2019s provision of service. \u00a7251(d)(2). Second, \u00a7251(c)(2)\nmandates that incumbent LECs \u201cprovide \u2026 interconnection\u201d between\ntheir networks and competitive LECs\u2019 facilities. This ensures that\ncustomers on a competitor\u2019s network can call customers on the\nincumbent\u2019s network, and vice versa. The interconnection duty is\nindependent of the unbundling rules and not subject to impairment\nanalysis. It is undisputed that both un-bundled network elements\nand interconnection must be provided at cost-based rates. See\n\u00a7252(d)(1); Brief for Petitioner in No. 10\u2013313, p.\u00a028; Brief\nfor Petitioners in No. 10\u2013329, p.\u00a07; Brief for Respondent\n4.These cases concern incumbent LECs\u2019 obligation\nto share existing \u201centrance facilities\u201d with competitive LECs.\nEntrance facilities are the transmission facilities (typically\nwires or cables) that connect competitive LECs\u2019 networks with\nincumbent LECs\u2019 networks. The FCC recently adopted a regulation\nspecifying that entrance facilities are not among the network\nelements that \u00a7251(c)(3) requires incumbents to lease to\ncompetitors on an unbundled basis at cost-based rates. See 47 CFR\n\u00a751.319(e)(2)(i) (2005). The Commission noted, however, that it\n\u201cd[id] not alter the right of competitive LECs to obtain\ninterconnection facilities pursuant to section 251(c)(2).\u201dIn\u00a0re Unbundled Access to Network Elements, 20 FCC\nRcd. 2533, 2611, \u00b6140 (2005)(Triennial Review Remand\nOrder).The specific issue here is whether respondent,\nMichigan Bell Telephone Company d/b/a AT&T Michigan (AT&T),\nmust lease existing entrance facilities to competitive LECs at\ncost-based rates. The FCC interprets its regulations to require\nAT&T to do so for the purpose of interconnection. We begin by\nreviewing the Commission\u2019s recent actions regarding entrance\nfacilities and then explain the particular dispute that is before\nus today.AIn 2003, the FCC decided,\ncontrary to its previous orders, that incumbent LECs were not\nobligated to provide cost-based unbundled access to entrance\nfacilities under \u00a7251(c)(3).In\u00a0re Review of Section 251\nUnbundling Obligations of Incumbent Local Exchange Carriers,\n18 FCC Rcd. 16978, 17202\u201317205, \u00b6\u00b6365\u2013367 (2003)(Triennial\nReview Order). Explaining that its previous approach had been\n\u201cmisguided\u201d and \u201coverly broad,\u201did., \u00b6\u00b6366, 365, the\nCommission concluded that entrance facilities were not subject to\nthe unbundling requirement because they are not network elements at\nall. Seeid., \u00b6366 (entrance facilities \u201cexistoutsidethe incumbent LEC\u2019s local network\u201d). The\nCommission therefore did not conduct an impairment analysis.The FCC emphasized, however, the\nlimits of this ruling. Entrance facilities are used for two\npurposes: interconnection and backhauling.[Footnote 2] It expressly \u201cd[id] not alter\u201d an incumbent\nLEC\u2019s obligation under \u00a7251(c)(2) to provide \u201cfacilities in order\nto \u2018interconnect with the incumbent LEC\u2019s network.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId.,\u00b6366 (brackets omitted). Thus, al-though the\nCommission specified that \u00a7251(c)(3) did not require any unbundled\nleasing of entrance facilities, it determined in practical effect\nonly that \u201cincumbent LECs [were not obligated] to unbundle\n[entrance facilities] for the purpose of backhauling traffic.\u201dId.,\u00b6365.On direct review, the D.\u00a0C. Circuit\nquestioned the Commission\u2019s determination that entrance facilities\nare not network elements under \u00a7251(c)(3), but found the agency\nrulemaking record insufficient and remanded to the Commission for\nfurther consideration. SeeUnited States Telecom Assn.v.FCC, 359 F.\u00a03d 554, 586, cert. denied,543 U. S. 925(2004).\nThe court noted that if entrance facilities were in fact\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018network elements,\u2019\u00a0\u201d then \u201can analysis of impairment\nwould presumably follow.\u201d 359 F.\u00a03d, at 586.In 2005, the Commission responded. SeeTriennial Review Remand Order\u00b6\u00b6136\u2013141. The Commission\nre-treated from its view that entrance facilities are not network\nelements but adhered to its previous position that cost-based\nunbundled access to them need not be provided under \u00a7251(c)(3).Id.,\u00b6\u00b6137\u2013138. Treating entrance facilities as network\nelements, the Commission concluded that competitive LECs are not\nimpaired without access to them.Ibid.The\nCommission again emphasized that it \u201cd[id] not alter the right of\ncompetitive LECs to obtain interconnection facilities pursuant to\nsection 251(c)(2).\u201dId.,\u00b6140.BIn the wake of theTriennial\nReview Remand Order, AT&T notified competitive LECs that\nit would no longer provide entrance facilities at cost-based rates\nfor either backhauling or interconnection, but would instead charge\nhigher rates. Competitive LECs complained to the Michigan Public\nService Commission (PSC) that AT&T was unlawfully abrogating\ntheir right to cost-based interconnection under \u00a7251(c)(2). The\nMichigan PSC agreed with the competitive LECs and ordered AT&T\nto continue providing entrance facilities for interconnection at\ncost-based rates.AT&T challenged the Michigan\nPSC\u2019s ruling in the District Court, which, relying on theTriennial Review Remand Order, ruled in AT&T\u2019s favor.\nThe Michigan PSC and several competitive LECs, including petitioner\nTalk America, Inc., appealed.The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit\naffirmed over a dissent.Michigan Bell Telephone Co.v.Covad Communications Co., 597 F.\u00a03d 370 (2010). At\nthe court\u2019s invitation, the FCC filed a brief asamicus\ncuriae, arguing that theTriennial Review Remand\nOrderdid not change incumbent LECs\u2019 interconnection\nobligations, including the obligation to lease entrance facilities\nfor interconnection. The Sixth Circuit declined to defer to the\nFCC\u2019s views, 597 F.\u00a03d, at 375, n.\u00a06, and also expressly\ndisagreed with the Seventh and Eighth Circuits,id.,at\n384\u2013386 (discussingIllinois Bell Tel. Co.v.Box, 526 F.\u00a03d 1069 (2008), andSouthwestern Bell\nTel., L.\u00a0P.v.Missouri Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n, 530\nF.\u00a03d 676 (2008)).[Footnote\n3]We granted certiorari, 562 U. S. ___ (2010),\nand now reverse.IIPetitioners contend that AT&T\nmust lease its existing entrance facilities for interconnection at\ncost-based rates. We agree.ANo statute or regulation squarely\naddresses whether an incumbent LEC must provide access to entrance\nfacilities at cost-based rates as part of its interconnection duty\nunder \u00a7251(c)(2). According to the statute, each incumbent LEC\nhas:\u201cThe duty to provide, for the\nfacilities and equipment of any requesting telecommunications\ncarrier, interconnection with the local exchange carrier\u2019s\nnetwork\u2014\u201c(A) for the transmission and routing of\ntelephone exchange service and exchange access;\u201c(B) at any technically feasible point within\nthe carrier\u2019s network;\u201c(C) that is at least equal in quality to that\nprovided by the local exchange carrier to itself or to any\nsubsidiary, affiliate, or any other party to which the carrier\nprovides interconnection; and\u201c(D) on rates, terms, and conditions that are\njust, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory, in accordance with the\nterms and conditions of the agreement and the requirements of this\nsection and section 252 of this title.\u201dNothing in that language expressly addresses\nentrance facilities. Nor does any regulation do so. See Brief for\nUnited States asAmicus Curiae22, n.\u00a06.AT&T contends that the statute makes clear\nthat an incumbent LEC need not provide access toanyfacilities\u2014much less entrance facilities\u2014to provide\ninterconnection. The company points out that \u00a7251(c)(2) does not\nmention incumbent LECs\u2019 facilities, but rather mandates only that\nincumbent LECs provide interconnection \u201cfor the facilities and\nequipment of any [competing] carrier.\u201d In contrast, AT&T notes,\n\u00a7251(c)(3) requires that incumbent LECs provide unbundled \u201caccess\nto [their] network elements.\u201dWe do not find the statute so clear. Although\n\u00a7251(c)(2) does not expressly require that incumbent LECs lease\nfacilities to provide interconnection, it also does not expressly\nexcuse them from doing so. The statute says nothing about what an\nincumbent LEC must do to \u201cprovide \u2026 interconnection.\u201d \u00a7251(c)(2).\n\u201c[T]he facilities and equipment of any [competing] carrier\u201d\nidentifies the equipment that an incumbent LEC must allow to\ninterconnect, but it does not specify what the incumbent LEC must\ndo to make the interconnection possible.Ibid.BIn the absence of any\nunambiguous statute or regulation, we turn to the FCC\u2019s\ninterpretation of its regulations in its amicusbrief. See,e.g.,Chase Bank USA, N.\u00a0A.v.McCoy, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 12). As we\nreaffirmed earlier this Term, we defer to an agency\u2019s\ninterpretation of its regulations, even in a legal brief, unless\nthe interpretation is \u201c\u00a0\u2018plainly erroneous or inconsistent\nwith the regulation[s]\u2019\u00a0\u201d or there is any other \u201c\u00a0\u2018reason\nto suspect that the interpretation does not reflect the agency\u2019s\nfair and considered judgment on the matter in question.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 12, 14) (quotingAuerv.Robbins,519 U. S. 452, 461, 462\n(1997)).The Commission contends that its\nregulations require AT&T to provide access at cost-based rates\nto its exist- ing entrance facilities for the purpose of\ninterconnection. The Commission\u2019s interpretation proceeds in three\nsteps. First, an incumbent LEC must lease \u201ctechnically feasible\u201d\nfacilities for interconnection. Second, entrance facili- ties are\namong the facilities that an incumbent must make available for\ninterconnection, if technically feasible. Third, it is technically\nfeasible to provide access to the particular entrance facilities at\nissue in these cases.1The Commission first contends\nthat an incumbent LEC must lease, at cost-based rates, any\nrequested facilities for obtaining interconnection with the\nincumbent LEC\u2019s network, unless it is technically infeasible to do\nso. Section 251(c)(2) mandates that an incumbent LEC provide\ninterconnection, at cost-based rates, \u201cat any technically feasible\npoint within the carrier\u2019s network.\u201d The FCC has long construed\n\u00a7251(c)(2) to require incumbent LECs to provide, at cost-based\nrates, \u201cany technically feasible method of obtaining\ninterconnection \u2026 at a particular point.\u201d 47 CFR \u00a751.321(a)\n(2010).The requirement in \u00a751.321(a) to\nprovide a \u201cmethod of obtaining interconnection,\u201d the Commission\nargues, encompasses a duty to lease an existing facility to a\ncompeting LEC. When the Commission originally promulgated\n\u00a751.321(a), it explained that incumbent LECs would be required to\n\u201cadapt their facilities to interconnection\u201d and to \u201caccept the\nnovel use of, and modification to, [their] network facilities.\u201dIn\u00a0re Implementation of Local Competition Provisions in\nthe Telecommunications Act of 1996, 11 FCC Rcd. 15499, 15605,\n\u00b6202 (1996)(Local Competition Order). Since then, as\nAT&T and itsamiciconcede, incumbent LECs have\ncommonly leased certain facilities at cost-based prices to\naccommodate interconnection. See Brief for Respondent 28\u201329; Brief\nfor United States Telecom Association et\u00a0al. asAmici\nCuriae33\u201335.As additional support for its assertion that\nincumbent LECs are obligated to lease facilities, the FCC\nhighlights the examples in \u00a751.321(b) of \u201c[t]echnically feasible\nmethods of obtaining interconnection,\u201d which include \u201c[m]eet point\ninterconnection arrangements.\u201d In a meet-point arrangement, an\nincumbent LEC \u201caccommodat[es]\u201d interconnection by building a\ntransmission facility from its network to a designated point, where\nit connects with the competitor\u2019s corresponding transmission\nfacility.Local Competition Order\u00b6553. Compared to that\nrequirement, the Commission argues, the obligation to lease\nexisting facilities for interconnection is quite modest.2Next, the Commission contends\nthat existing entrance facilities are among the facilities that an\nincumbent LEC must lease for interconnection. According to the FCC,\ntheTriennial Review Remand Orderadopted a regulatory\ndef-inition that reestablished that entrance facilities are part of\nan incumbent LEC\u2019s network. See \u00b6137; see also 47 CFR \u00a751.319(e)\n(2005). The end of every entrance facility is therefore a \u201cpoint\nwithin [an incumbent] carrier\u2019s network\u201d at which a competing LEC\ncould request interconnection, 47 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7251(c)(2), and\neach entrance facility potentially provides a \u201ctechnically feasible\nmethod of obtaining interconnection,\u201d 47 CFR \u00a751.321(a) (2010).3Finally, the FCC contends that\nproviding access to the entrance facilities here for\ninterconnection purposes is technically feasible. Under the\nCommission\u2019s regulations, an incumbent LEC bears the burden of\nshowing that a requested method or point of interconnection is\ntechnically infeasible. See 47 CFR \u00a7\u00a751.305(e), 51.321(d); see also\n\u00a7\u00a751.305(d), 51.321(c) (previously successful intercon-nection is\n\u201csubstantial evidence\u201d of technical feasibility). AT&T does not\ndispute technical feasibility here.[Footnote 4]CThe FCC\u2019s interpretation is not\n\u201cplainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation[s].\u00a0\u201dAuer,supra,at 461 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). First, we disagree with AT&T\u2019s argument that entrance\nfacilities are not a part of incumbent LECs\u2019 networks. Indeed, the\nCommission\u2019s view on this question is more than reasonable; it is\ncertainly not plainly erroneous. TheTriennial Review Remand\nOrderresponded to the D.\u00a0C. Circuit\u2019s decision\nquestioning the Commission\u2019s earlier finding that entrance\nfacilities are not network elements. It revised the definition of\ndedicated transport\u2014a type of network element\u2014to include entrance\nfacilities.Triennial Review Remand Order\u00b6\u00b6136\u2013137; see\n47 CFR \u00a751.319(e)(1) (defining dedicated transport to include\n\u201cincumbent LEC transmission facilities \u2026 between wire centers or\nswitches owned by incumbent LECs and switches owned by [competing]\ncarriers\u201d). Given that revised definition, it is perfectly sensible\nto conclude that entrance facilities are a part of incumbent LECs\u2019\nnetworks.Second, we are not persuaded by\nAT&T\u2019s argument that the Commission\u2019s views conflict with the\ndefinition of interconnection in \u00a751.5. That regulation provides:\n\u201cInterconnection is the linking of two networks for the mutual\nexchange of traffic. This term does not include the transport and\ntermination of traffic.\u201d AT&T focuses on the definition\u2019s\nexclusion of \u201ctransport and termination of traffic.\u201d An entrance\nfacility is a transport facility, AT&T argues, and it makes no\nsense to require an incumbent LEC to furnish a transport facility\nfor interconnection when the definition of interconnection\nexpressly excludes transport.We think AT&T reads too much into the\nexclusion of \u201ctransport.\u201d The regulation cannot possibly mean that\nno transport can occur across an interconnection facility, as that\nwould directly conflict with the statutory language. See \u00a7251(c)(2)\n(requiring \u201cinterconnection \u2026 for the transmission and routing of\n[local] telephone exchange service\u201d). The very reason for\ninterconnection is the \u201cmutual exchange of traffic.\u201d 47 CFR \u00a751.5;\nsee alsoCompetitive Telecommunications Assn.v.FCC, 117 F.\u00a03d 1068, 1071\u20131072 (CA8 1997) (\u201c[T]he\ntransmission and routing of telephone exchange service\u201d is \u201cwhat\nthe interconnection, the physical link, would be used for\u201d\n(internal quotation marks omitted)).The better reading of the regulation is that\nit merely reflects that the \u201ctransport and termination of traffic\u201d\nis subject to different regulatory treatment than interconnection.\nCompensation for transport and termination\u2014that is, for delivering\nlocal telephone calls placed by another carrier\u2019s customer\u2014is\ngoverned by separate stat-utory provisions and regulations. See 47\nU. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a7251(b)(5), 252(d)(2); 47 CFR \u00a751.701. The\nCommission explains that a competitive LEC typically pays one fee\nfor interconnection\u2014\u201cjust for having the link\u201d\u2014and then an\nadditional fee for the transport and termination of telephone\ncalls. Tr. of Oral Arg. 28; see also Brief for United States asAmicus Curiae3, n.\u00a01. Entrance facilities, at least\nwhen used for the mutual exchange of traffic, seem to us to fall\ncomfortably within the definition of interconnection. See 597\nF.\u00a03d, at 388 (Sutton, J., dissenting) (noting that entrance\nfacilities are \u201cdesigned for the very purpose of linking two\ncarriers\u2019 networks\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).In sum, the Commission\u2019s interpretation of its\nregulations is neither plainly erroneous nor inconsistent with the\nregulatory text. Contrary to AT&T\u2019s assertion, there is no\ndanger that deferring to the Commission would effectively \u201cpermit\nthe agency, under the guise of interpreting a regulation, to createde factoa new regulation.\u201d[Footnote 5]Christensenv.Harris\nCounty,529 U.\nS. 576, 588 (2000).DNor is there any other \u201creason to\nsuspect that the interpretation does not reflect the agency\u2019s fair\nand considered judgment on the matter in question.\u201dAuer,\n519 U. S., at 462. We are not faced with apost-hocrationalization by Commission counsel of agency action that is\nunder judicial review. Seeibid.;see alsoBurlington\nTruck Lines, Inc.v.United States,371 U. S. 156, 168\u2013169\n(1962) (\u201cThe courts may not accept appellate counsel\u2019spost\nhocrationalizations for agency action; [SECv.]Chenery[Corp.,332 U. S. 194(1947),]\nrequires that an agency\u2019s discretionary order be upheld, if at all,\non the same basis articulated in the order by the agency\nitself\u201d).And although the FCC concedes that it is\nadvancing a novel interpretation of its longstanding\ninterconnection regulations, novelty alone is not a reason to\nrefuse deference. The Commission ex-plains that the issue in these\ncases did not arise until recently\u2014when it initially eliminated\nunbundled access to entrance facilities in theTriennial Review\nOrder. Until then, the Commission says, a competitive LEC\ntypically would elect to lease a cost-priced entrance facility\nunder \u00a7251(c)(3) since entrance facilities leased under \u00a7251(c)(3)\ncould be used for any purpose\u2014i.e., both interconnection\nand backhauling\u2014but entrance facilities leased under \u00a7251(c)(2) can\nbe used only for interconnection. We see no reason to doubt this\nexplanation.AT&T suggests that the\nCommission is attempting to require under \u00a7251(c)(2) what courts\nhave prevented it from requiring under \u00a7251(c)(3) and what the\nCommission itself said wasnotrequired in theTriennial Review Remand Order. Tr. of Oral Arg. 50\n(\u201c[T]his is a rear guard effort to preserve [cost-based] pricing\nfor things that the [C]ommission has said should no longer be\navailable \u2026 at [such] pricing\u201d). We do not think that AT&T is\ncorrect.1To begin with, AT&T\u2019s\naccusation does not square with the regulatory history. The\nCommission was not compelled to eliminate the obligation to lease\nunbundled entrance facilities at cost-based rates.It is true that, prior to theTriennial Revieworders, the Commission twice\nunsuccessfully attempted to impose sweeping unbundling requirements\non incumbent LECs. SeeLocal Competition Order\u00b6278;In\u00a0re Implementation of Local Competition Provisions of\nthe Telecommunications Act of 1996, 15 FCC Rcd. 3696,\n3771\u20133904, \u00b6\u00b6162\u2013464 (1999); see also 47 CFR \u00a751.319 (1997);\n\u00a751.319 (2000). Each time, the Commission\u2019s efforts were rejected\nfor taking an unreasonably broad view of \u201cimpair[ment]\u201d under\n\u00a7251(d)(2). SeeIowa Utilities Bd., 525 U. S.,at\n392;United States Telecom Assn.v.FCC, 290\nF.\u00a03d 415, 421\u2013428 (2002), cert. denied,538 U. S. 940(2003). In\ntheTriennial Review Order, the Commission once again\nreinterpreted the \u201cimpair\u201d standard and revised the list of network\nelements that incumbents must provide unbundled to competitors.The Commission\u2019s initial decision to eliminate\nthe obligation to unbundle entrance facilities, however, was not a\nresult of the narrower view of impairment mandated by this Court\nand the D.\u00a0C. Circuit. Instead, the Commission determined that\nentrance facilities need not be provided on an unbundled basis\nunder \u00a7251(c)(3) on the novel ground that they are not network\nelements at all\u2014something no court had ever suggested.Moreover, since its initial decision to\neliminate the unbundling obligation for entrance facilities, the\nCommission has been committed to that position. When the D.\u00a0C.\nCircuit questioned the Commission\u2019s finding that entrance\nfacilities are not network elements, the Commission responded by\nobserving that the court \u201cdid not reject our conclusion that\nincumbent LECs need not unbundle entrance facilities, only the\nanalysis through which we reached that conclusion.\u201dTriennial\nReview Remand Order\u00b6137. The Commission then found another\nway to support that same conclusion.2More importantly, AT&T\u2019s\ncharacterization of what the Commission has done, and is doing, is\ninaccurate. TheTriennial Revieworders eliminated\nincumbent LECs\u2019 obli-gation under \u00a7251(c)(3) to provide unbundled\naccess to entrance facilities. But the FCC emphasized in both\norders that it \u201cd[id] not alter\u201d the obligation on incumbent LECs\nunder \u00a7251(c)(2) to provide facilities for interconnection\npurposes.Triennial Review Order\u00b6366;Triennial\nReview Remand Order\u00b6140. Because entrance facilities are used\nfor backhauling and interconnection purposes, the FCC effectively\neliminated only unbundled access to entrance facilities for\nbackhauling purposes\u2014a nuance it expressly noted in the firstTriennial Revieworder.Triennial Review Order\u00b6365. That distinction is neither unusual nor ambiguous.[Footnote 6] In these cases, the\nCommission is simply explaining the interconnection obligation that\nit left undisturbed in theTriennial Revieworders. We see\nno conflict between theTriennial Revieworders and the\nCommission\u2019s views expressed here.[Footnote 7]We are not concerned that theTriennial Review Remand Orderdid not expressly\ndistinguish between backhauling and interconnection, though\nAT&T makes much of that fact. AT&T argues that the\nCommission\u2019s holding in theTriennial Review Remand Orderis broader than that in theTriennial Review Order. In\nAT&T\u2019s view, the Commission concluded in theTriennial\nReview Remand Orderthat competitors are not impaired if they\nlack cost-based access to entrance facilities for backhaulingorinterconnection.There are two flaws with AT&T\u2019s reasoning.\nFirst, as we have discussed, theTriennial Review Remand\nOrderreinstated the ultimate conclusion of theTriennial\nReview Orderand changed only \u201cthe analysis through which [it]\nreached that conclusion.\u201dTriennial Review Remand Order\u00b6137. Second, unlike \u00a7251(c)(3)\u2019s unbundling obligation,\n\u00a7251(c)(2)\u2019s interconnection obligation does not require the\nCommission to consider impairment. As the dissent below observed,\nit would be surprising indeed if the FCC had taken the novel step\nof incorporating impairment into interconnection without comment.\n597 F.\u00a03d, at 389 (opinion of Sutton, J.).*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*The FCC asamicus curiaehas advanced a reasonable interpretation of its regulations, and we\ndefer to its views. The judgment of the United States Court of\nAppeals for the Sixth Circuit is reversed.It is so ordered.Justice Kagan took no part in the\nconsideration or decision of these cases.Footnote 1The Solicitor General, joined by counsel for\nthe FCC, represents that theamicusbrief for the United\nStates filed in this Court reflects the Commission\u2019s considered\ninterpretation of its own rules and orders. Brief for United States\nasAmicus Curiae31. We thus refer to the Government\u2019s\narguments in these cases as those of the agency. See,e.g.,Chase Bank USA, N.\u00a0A.v.McCoy, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 8).Footnote 2Although the parties and theiramicidisagree over the precise definition of backhauling, they all\nappear to agree that backhauling is important to competitive LECs\nand occurs when a competitive LEC uses an entrance facility to\ntransport traffic from a leased portion of an incumbent network to\nthe competitor\u2019s own facilities. Backhauling does not involve the\nexchange of traffic between incumbent and competitive networks.\nSee,e.g.,Brief for Petitioners in No. 10\u2013329,\np.\u00a025; Brief for United States Telecom Association et\u00a0al.\nasAmici Curiae32. It thus differs from\ninterconnection\u2014\u201cthe linking of two networks for the mutual\nexchange of traffic.\u201d 47 CFR \u00a751.5 (2010).Footnote 3The Ninth Circuit has since joined the\nSeventh and Eighth Circuits.Pacific Bell Tel. Co.v.California Pub. Util. Comm\u2019n, 621 F.\u00a03d 836\n(2010).Footnote 4These cases concern only existing entrance\nfacilities, and the Commission expressly declines to address\nwhether it reads its regulations to require incumbent LECs to build\nnew entrance facilities for interconnection. Brief for United\nStates asAmicus Curiae25, n.\u00a07. The Commission\nsuggests here, as it has before, that additional considerations of\ncost or reasonableness might be appropriate if a competitive LEC\nwere to request that an incumbent LEC build new entrance facilities\nfor interconnection.Ibid.(noting that the Commission\u2019s\nWireline Competition Bureau has declined to require an incumbent\nLEC to bear the entire cost of building new entrance facilities);\nsee alsoLocal Competition Order\u00b6553 (explaining with\nrespect to meet-point arrangements that \u201cthe parties and state\ncommissions are in a better position than the Commission to\ndetermine the appropriate distance that would constitute the\nrequired reasonable accommodation of interconnection\u201d). We express\nno view on the matter.Footnote 5There is no merit to AT&T\u2019s assertion\nthat the FCC is improperly amending the list of \u201c[t]echnically\nfeasible methods of obtaining interconnection\u201d set forth in 47 CFR\n\u00a751.321(b). By its own terms, that list is nonexhaustive. See\n\u00a751.321(b) (\u201c[t]echnically feasible methods of obtaining\ninterconnection \u2026 include, but are not limited to\u201d the listed\nexamples); see also \u00a751.321(a) (\u201c[A]n incumbent LEC shall provide \u2026anytechnically feasible method of obtaining\ninterconnection\u201d (emphasis added)).Footnote 6The Commission has long recognized that a\nsingle facility can be used for different functions and that its\nregulatory treatment can vary depending on its use. Unbundled\nnetwork elements, for example, may not be used for the exclusive\nprovision of mobile wireless or long-distance services. 47 CFR\n\u00a751.309(b) (2010). Similarly, interconnection arrangements may be\nused for local telephone service but not for long-distance\nservices. \u00a751.305(b).Footnote 7The parties and theiramicidispute\nwhether an incumbent LEC has any way of knowing how a competitive\nLEC is using an entrance facility. This technical factual dispute\nsimply underscores the appropriateness of deferring to the FCC. So\nlong as the Commission is acting within the scope of its delegated\nauthority and in accordance with prescribed procedures, it has\ngreater expertise and stands in a better position than this Court\nto make the technical and policy judgments necessary to administer\nthe complex regulatory program at issue here.",
