Their group is the conspiratorial entity and the\nvictim is \u201canother\u201d person.But in upholding the conspiracy conviction here,\nthe Court interprets the phrase extorting property \u201cfrom another\u201d\nin the Hobbs Act contrary to that natural un-derstanding. It holds\nthat a group of conspirators can agree to obtain property \u201cfrom\nanother\u201d in violation of the Act even if they agree only to\ntransfer property among themselves.That is not a natural or logical way to\ninterpret the phrase \u201cfrom another.\u201d I respectfully dissent.IThe indictment here charged Ocasio, a former\nBaltimore police officer, with participating in a kickback scheme\nengineered by the owners of a local auto repair shop, brothers\nHerman Moreno and Edwin Mejia. Ocasio and other Baltimore officers\nreferred car-accident victims to the brothers\u2019 shop for body repair\nwork. In exchange, Moreno and Mejia paid Ocasio between $150 and\n$300 for each referral. The indictment pleaded that Ocasio, other\nofficers, and the brothers conspired in violation of the federal\nconspiracy statute, 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7371, to commit extortion\nin violation of the Hobbs Act, \u00a71951.The federal conspiracy statute applies whenever\n\u201ctwo or more persons conspire\u201d to commit a federal offense and at\nleast one of them acts in furtherance of the offense. \u00a7371. The\nHobbs Act, a federal offense, punishes \u201c[w]hoever\u201d commits\n\u201cextortion,\u201d \u00a71951(a), and defines \u201cextortion\u201d as \u201cthe obtaining of\nproperty from another, with his consent, .\u00a0.\u00a0. under\ncolor of official right,\u201d \u00a71951(b)(2). \u201cExtortion\u201d includes taking\na bribe. SeeEvansv.United States, 504 U.\u00a0S.\n255 (1992) .[1] Putting this\nall together, in charging Ocasio with conspiring to commit\nextortion, prosecutors charged him with agreeing to take bribes\n\u201cfrom another\u201d person. \u00a71951(b)(2).At trial, rather than attempt to prove that\nOcasio agreed with otherofficersto take bribes from Moreno\nand Mejia, the Government contended that when Ocasio agreed to take\nthe brothers\u2019 bribes, he and thebrothersagreed that Ocasio\nwould obtain property \u201cfrom another\u201d person,i.e.,someone\nother than himself. Ocasio argued, by contrast, that it is\nimpossible for a group of people to agree to obtain property \u201cfrom\nanother\u201d without evidence that \u201canother\u201d person outside the\nconspiratorial agreement gave up their property. Ocasio conceded\nthat he alone could violate the Hobbs Act by taking a bribe from\none of the brothers, but maintained that he and thebrothers as a\ngroup could not also violate the conspiracy statute by agreeing\nthat one of them would take abribe from themselves. This Court now\nrejects Ocasio\u2019s interpretation.IIThe Hobbs Act criminalizes extortion where a\npublic official obtains property \u201cfrom another.\u201d \u00a71951(b)(2). The\nquestion here is how to define \u201canother\u201d in the context of a\nconspiracy to commit extortion. \u201cAnother\u201d is a relational word. It\ndescribes how one entity is connected to a different entity. In\nparticular, it describes an entity \u201cdifferent or distinct from the\none first considered.\u201d Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary 51\n(11th ed. 2003).[2]In this case\u2014a conspiracy to violate the Hobbs\nAct by obtaining property \u201cfrom another\u201d\u2014the relevant entity to\nconsider is the conspiratorial group. The federal generic\nconspiracy statute makes it a crime for two or more people to\n\u201cconspire.\u201d \u00a7371. This Court gives the word \u201cconspire\u201d its\nconventional meaning. SeeSalinasv.United States,\n522 U.\u00a0S. 52, 63 (1997) . To \u201cconspire\u201d is to agree, and the\ncrux of a \u201cconspiracy\u201d is a \u201ccollective criminal agreement\u2014[a]\npartnership in crime.\u201dCallananv.United States, 364\nU.\u00a0S. 587, 593 (1961) .The most natural reading of \u201cconspiring\u201d to\nobtain property \u201cfrom another,\u201d then, is a collective agreement to\nobtain property from an entity different or distinct from the\nconspiracy. But Ocasio, Moreno, and Mejia did not agree that Ocasio\nwould obtain property from a person different or distinct from the\nconspirators as a group. They agreed only that Ocasio would take\nproperty from Moreno and Mejia\u2014people who arepart ofrather\nthandistinct fromthe conspiracy. \u201cThese three people did\nnot agree, and could not have agreed, to obtain property from\n\u2018another\u2019 when no other person was involved.\u201dUnited Statesv.Brock, 501 F.\u00a03d 762, 767 (CA6 2007).This understanding of \u201canother\u201d\u2014that it refers\nto someone outside the conspiracy\u2014is consistent not only with the\nplain meaning of the Hobbs Act, but also with this Court\u2019s\nprecedent explaining that the purpose of conspiracy law is to\ntarget the conduct of group crimes. Conspiracy law punishes the\n\u201ccollective criminal agreement,\u201d because a \u201c[c]ombination\u201d or\n\u201c[g]roup association for criminal purposes\u201d is more dangerous than\nseparate individuals acting alone.Callanan, 364 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 593. A conspiracy is \u201ca partnership in crime,\u201d a\n\u201cconfederation,\u201d a \u201cscheme,\u201d and an \u201centerprise.\u201dPinkertonv.United States, 328 U.\u00a0S. 640 \u2013647 (1946).\nAccordingly, the law treats a conspiracy, at least in some ways, as\nan entity distinct from its individual members.A defendant is guilty of conspiracy only if he\nagrees that the conspiratorial group intends to commit all the\nelements of the criminal offense.Salinas, 522 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 65 (\u201cA conspirator must intend to further an endeavor which, if\ncompleted, would satisfy all of the elements of a substantive\ncriminal offense\u201d). Because the focus is on the group\u2019s\nconduct\u2014what \u201cendeavor\u201d they have agreed to commit\ncollectively\u2014when individual members of a conspiracy act to advance\nthe conspiratorial endeavor, they act not on behalf of themselves,\nbut as \u201cagents for [the conspiracy\u2019s] performance.\u201dHydev.United States, 225 U.\u00a0S. 347, 369 (1912) . It does not\nmatter if a single member of the group undertakes to commit every\nelement of the offense.Sa-linas,522 U.\u00a0S., at 63\u201364\n(\u201cThe partners in the criminal planmust agree to pursue the same\ncriminal objective and may divide up the work, yet each is\nresponsible for the acts of each other\u201d). When that one member acts\nas an agent for the conspiracy in furthering their collective\nendeavor, his actions are \u201cattributable to the others,\u201d not just\nthe in-dividual agent alone.Pinkerton,328 U.\u00a0S., at\n647; seealsoid.,at 646 (\u201c[S]o long as the partnership in\ncrime continues, the partners act for each other in carrying it\nforward\u201d).Accordingly, whether a criminal conspiracy\nexists depends on what the conspirators agreed to do as a group.\nThis principle confirms that \u201cfrom another\u201d is best understood as\nrelating the conspiratorial enterprise to another person outside\nthe conspiracy. A conspiracy to obtain property \u201cfrom another,\u201d\nthen, is the group agreement that at least one member of the group\nwill obtain property from someone who is not a part of their\nendeavor.Departing from this natural reading of the text,\nthe Court holds that Ocasio can be punished for conspiracy because\nOcasio obtained property \u201cfrom another\u201d (Moreno and Mejia) and\nOcasio, Moreno, and Mejia agreed that Ocasio would engage in that\nconduct. In order to reach this conclusion, the Court implicitly\nassumes that the Hobbs Act\u2019s use of \u201cfrom another\u201d takes as its\nreference point only a single member of the conspiracy, here,\nOcasio, rather than the group of conspirators as a whole. Seeante,at 5.But what is the basis for that assumption? The\nCourt never explains. It is not based on the plain language of the\nHobbs Act. A natural reading of the text seems to foreclose\nit\u2014Moreno and Mejia are not \u201cdistinct or different from\u201d the group\nthat formed the \u201ccollective criminal agreement.\u201d And the Court\u2019s\nassumption does not follow from prior precedent or any first\nprinciples of conspiracy law. See Part III,infra.Both the plain meaning of the statute and\ngeneral principles of conspiracy law lead to the same conclusion: A\nconspiracy to commit extortion by obtaining property \u201cfrom another\u201d\nin violation of the Hobbs Act should exist only when the\nconspirators agree to obtain property from someone outside the\nconspiracy.IIIThe Court does not ground its decision in the\nHobbs Act\u2019s use of the language \u201cfrom another.\u201d It instead relies\non what it says are \u201cage-old principles of conspiracy law.\u201dAnte,at 1. But it does so to no avail. Most of these\nso-called principles are derived from decisions that turn on\ninterpreting thetextof another federal statute\u2014the Mann\nAct. And the remaining generic principles the Court cites do not\nresolve the precise question in this case: whether the Hobbs Act\u2019s\nuse of the phrase obtain property \u201cfrom another\u201d adopts the\nperspective of an individual conspirator or the conspiratorial\ngroup as a collective.The Court\u2019s best support comes from cases\ninterpreting the Mann Act, which made it a crime for \u201cany person\n[to] knowingly transport .\u00a0.\u00a0. in interstate or foreign\ncommerce .\u00a0.\u00a0. any woman or girl for the purpose of\nprostitution or debauchery.\u201dAnte,at 7\u201311 (quoting ch. 395,\n36Stat. 825) (emphasis deleted). In one of its decisions, this\nCourt held that even though the transported \u201cwoman or girl\u201d was\nostensibly the victim of the crime, nothing in the statute\nprecluded prosecutors from also convicting the woman for conspiring\nwith another person to transport herself illegally.United\nStatesv.Holte, 236 U.\u00a0S. 140, 144 (1915) . From\nthis, the Court derives a generic principle of conspiracy law that\na victim of Hobbs Act extortion can also be liable as a\nco-conspirator, just like the victim of a Mann Act violation can.Ante,at 8\u201311.The Court stretches this Mann Act case beyond\nits tethers. The Court inHoltebased its analysis entirely\non the text of the Act, not generic principles of conspiracy law.\nUnlike the Hobbs Act\u2019s use of \u201canotherperson,\u201d the Mann Act\nprohibits transporting \u201canywoman.\u201d Based on this language,\nthe Court concluded that a woman could be held liable for\nconspiring with others to violate the Act.Holte,236\nU.\u00a0S., at 144\u201345. For example, a \u201cprofessional prostitute\u201d\ncould \u201csuggest and carry out a journey\u201d and \u201cbuy the railroad\ntickets.\u201dId.,at 145; see also 36Stat. 825 (Mann Act)\n(specifying that \u201cprocuring or obtaining, any ticket or tickets\u201d\nwas assistance of a criminal sort). Thus, the Court held, \u201cshe\nwould bewithin the letter of the act.\u00a0.\u00a0. , and\nwe see no reason why the act should not be held to apply.\u201d 236\nU.\u00a0S.,at 145 (emphasis added).Moreover, becauseHoltebased its holding\non the text of the relevant substantive offense, its reasoning is\nconsistent with this Court\u2019s actual principles of conspiracy, which\nadopt the perspective of the conspiratorial group to determine if\ntheir agreed-upon conduct violated the text of the statute. If the\nmembers of an alleged Mann Act conspiracy agree to transport\nillegally \u201canywoman,\u201d the group enterprise can logically\nand naturally intend to transport a female member of the group. But\nthat logic does not hold in this case, where the Hobbs Act requires\nthe conspirators to agree to obtain property \u201cfrom another.\u201d \u201cAny,\u201d\nunlike \u201canother,\u201d is not a relational word that requires\ndetermining who is in the group and who is out.The Court similarly attempts to create a generic\nconspiracy principle when it citesGebardiv.United\nStates, 287 U.\u00a0S. 112 (1932) , another Mann Act case that\nrelies on the Act\u2019s text. InGebardi, the Court considered\nthe question whether a woman who merely acquiesced to being\ntransported could be held liable for conspiring to violate the Act.\nThe Court held that a conspiracy could exist only if the woman\naided and assisted in her own transportation\u2014something more than\n\u201cmere agreement\u201d or \u201cmere acquiescence\u201d to being transported.Id.,at 119, 123. The Court based this decision explicitly\non the language of the Mann Act, which \u201cdoes not punish the woman\nfor transporting herself .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. For the woman to\nfall within the ban of the statute she must, at the least, \u2018aid or\nassist\u2019 someone else in transporting or in procuring transportation\nfor herself.\u201dId.,at 118\u2013119.Accordingly, the Court reasoned, the \u201cnecessary\nimplication\u201d of Congress\u2019 decision not to include a woman who\nmerely consents in the scope of the Act was \u201cthat when the Mann Act\nand the conspiracy statute came to be construed together, as they\nnecessarily would be,\u201d Congress did not intend for that woman to\nnevertheless always be held liable as a conspirator.Id.,at\n123. This Court later characterizedGebardi\u2019s holding as an\n\u201cexceptio[n] of a limited character\u201d to ordinary conspiracy law\nbased on the \u201cdefinition of the substantive offense,\u201di.e.,the text of the statute.Pinkerton, 328 U.\u00a0S., at 643.\nWhatever ordinary conspiracy principles might dictate, it was clear\nwhat Congress intended the outcome to be in that case.The Court tries to elicit a general principle of\nconspiracy law fromGebardi: that while the ostensible\nvictim of the statute\u2014there a woman transported, here a person\npaying a bribe\u2014cannot be convicted as a co-conspirator if she\nmerely acquiesces to the transportation or bribe, an active\nparticipant in the conspiratorial group can nevertheless be found\nguilty of conspiracy.Ante,at 15\u201316. The Court draws this\nrough analogy in an attempt to cabin the scope of future Hobbs Act\nconspiracy charges to exclude potential defendants whose\nparticipation in extortion amounts to no more than \u201cmere\nacquiescence.\u201d But this ignores the reasoning ofGebardi\u2014the\nCourt\u2019s reliance on the express terms of the Mann Act, not any\ngeneric conspiracy principles, led the Court to exclude a woman who\n\u201cmerely acquiesces\u201d to being transported.In addition to the Mann Act, the Court argues\nthat its interpretation is correct because Mejia and Moreno can be\nheld liable for conspiring to commit extortion even though they\nwere incapable of committing the substantive crime themselves.\n(Because they are not public officials, Mejia and Moreno cannot\nobtain property \u201cunder color of official right.\u201dAnte,at\n5\u20137.) True enough. But this principle does not lead to the\nconclusion that \u201cfrom another\u201d takes the perspective of Ocasio as\nits reference point, as opposed to the conspiratorial group.For example, suppose a politician and a lobbyist\nconspire to have the lobbyist tell his clients to pay the\npolitician bribes in exchange for official acts. The lobbyist\ncannot obtain those bribes under color of official right and so\ncould not be charged with a substantive Hobbs Act extortion\nviolation. But the conspiracy would still violate the Hobbs Act,\nseeEvans, 504 U.\u00a0S., at 268, because the\nconspiratorial group obtained property \u201cfrom another,\u201di.e.,from the clients who are outside the conspiracy that exists between\nthe lobbyist and the politician. Now suppose the lobbyist instead\nagrees to pay the bribe himself. We would be back to the question\nat the heart of this case.The Court\u2019s\nincapable-of-committing-the-substantive-offense principle therefore\ncannot do the work the Court thinks it does. It is entirely\nconsistent to say obtaining property \u201cfrom another\u201d in violation of\nthe Hobbs Act requires the conspirators to agree to obtain property\nfrom someone outside the conspiracy, and to say that every\nconspirator who enters into that agreement need not be capable of\ncommitting the substantive offense himself.Finally, the Court raises policy concerns: It\nmentions that it would be odd to immunize the ostensible victims of\na conspiracy to commit extortion\u2014here, Mejia and Moreno\u2014if they\nplay just as active a role in the conspiracy as other members.Ante, at 18.While perhaps odd, that concern does not warrant\nthe Court\u2019s contortion of conspiracy law where there are other\ncriminal statutes\u2014like federal antibribery laws and state laws\u2014that\nreach similar conduct. See,e.g.,18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7666\n(criminalizing bribery of state, local, or tribal officials in\nspecified circumstances); Md. Crim. Law Code Ann. \u00a79\u2013201 (2012)\n(criminalizing bribery of public employee).[3] Of course, the Government could have attempted to\nconvict Ocasio for conspiracy on these facts without relying on the\nCourt\u2019s odd theory\u2014for example, by proving that Ocasio conspired\nwith other Baltimore police officers to extort property from the\nbrothers.And, in its effort to make sure Ocasio, Moreno,\nand Mejia get their just deserts, the Court\u2019s atextual\ninterpretation of the Hobbs Act exposes innocent victims of\nextortion to charges that they \u201cconspired\u201d with their extorter\nwhenever they agree to pay a bribe. The Court says not to worry, it\nwill limit the scope of a conspiracy to exclude potential\ndefendants whose participation in the extortion amounts to no more\nthan \u201cmere acquiescence,\u201d analogizing toGebardi.Ante, at 15\u201316.ButGebardigrounded its \u201cmere\nacquiescence\u201d standard in the text of the Mann Act. Seesupra, at 8\u20139. Here, without any textual hook in the Hobbs\nAct, the Court rests on no more than intuitions drawn from basic\nexamples. If a restaurant owner threatened with closure by a health\nofficial reluctantly pays a bribe, the Court says that the owner is\nnot guilty of conspiracy.Ante, at 16. According to the\nCourt, he \u201cconsented\u201d to extortion, but his mere acquiescence to an\n\u201cofficial demand\u201d did not create a conspiratorial agreement.Ibid. By contrast, the Court says, if a nightclub owner\npursues a liquor license by asking his manager to bribe a public\nofficial, he is clearly guilty of conspiracy.Ante, at 18.\nHe agreed with the public official that the official would obtain\nproperty \u201cfrom another,\u201di.e., from him, in exchange for a\nlicense.Ibid.These examples raise more questions than\nanswers. When does mere \u201cconsent\u201d tip over into conspiracy? Does it\ndepend on whose idea it was? Whether the bribe was floated as an\n\u201cofficial demand\u201d or a suggestion? How happy the citizen is to pay\noff the public official? How much money is involved? Whether the\ncitizen gained a benefit (a liquor license) or avoided a loss\n(closing the restaurant)? How many times the citizen paid the\nbribes? Whether he ever resisted paying or called the police? The\nCourt does not say. It leaves it for federal prosecutors to answer\nthose questions in the first instance, raising the specter of\npotentially charging everybody with conspiracy and seeing what\nsticks and who flips.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*When three people agree to obtain property\n\u201cfromanother,\u201d the everyday understanding of their agreement is\nthat they intend to obtain property from someone outsideof their\nconspiracy. The Court reaches the opposite conclusion, based\nentirely on an assumption that the Hobbs Act\u2019s use of \u201cfrom\nanother\u201d takes as its reference point the vantage of Ocasio alone,\nrather than the group endeavor that constitutes conspiracy. The\nCourt offers no explanation\u2014grounded in either the text of the\nstatute or so-called \u201cage-old principles of conspiracy law\u201d\u2014for why\nthat assumption is correct.Conspiracy has long been criticized as vague and\nelastic, fitting whatever a prosecutor needs in a given case. See,e.g.,Krulewitchv.United States, 336\nU.\u00a0S. 440 \u2013457 (1949) (Jackson, J., concurring). This Court\nhas warned that \u201cwe will view with disfavor attempts to broaden the\nalready pervasive and wide-sweeping nets of conspiracy\nprosecutions.\u201dGrunewaldv.United States, 353\nU.\u00a0S. 391, 404 (1957) . Today, in reaching an unnatural\noutcome predicated on an unsupported assumption, the Court says\nnever mind.I respectfully dissent.Notes1Justice Thomas sets forth\nwhy he believesEvanswas wrongly decided.Ante,at 1\n(dissenting opinion). No party asks us to overruleEvansin\nthis case and so that question is not considered here.2See also Oxford English\nDictionary 348 (1st ed. 1933) (\u201cOne more, one further, originally a\nsecond of two things; subsequently extended to anything additional\nor remaining beyond those already considered; an additional\u201d\n(emphasis deleted)); Oxford English Dictionary 495 (2d ed. 1989)\n(same); Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary 110 (2d ed. 1950)\n(\u201cA different, distinct, or separate (one) from the one\nconsidered\u201d); New Oxford American Dictionary 65 (3d ed. 2010)\n(\u201cused to refer to a different person or thing from one already\nmentioned or known about\u201d); American Heritage Dictionary 74 (4th\ned. 2000) (\u201cDistinctly different from the first\u201d).3Moreover, any oddity in\nthe Hobbs Act\u2019s failure to punish the bribe payors for conspiring\nwith the bribe takers may be partly explained by this Court\u2019s\ndecision to hold that extortion under the Hobbs Act reaches a\npublic official who accepts a bribe in the first place.
