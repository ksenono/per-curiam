NEW HAMPSHIREon writ of certiorari to the supreme court of\nnew hampshire[January 11, 2012]Justice Sotomayor,\ndissenting.This Court has long\nrecognized that eyewitness identifications\u2019 unique confluence of\nfeatures\u2014their unreliability, susceptibility to suggestion,\npowerful impact on the jury, and resistance to the ordinary tests\nof the adversarial process\u2014can undermine the fairness of a trial.\nOur cases thus establish a clear rule: The admission at trial of\nout-of-court eyewitness identifications derived from imper-missibly\nsuggestive circumstances that pose a very substan- tial likelihood\nof misidentification violates due process. The Court today\nannounces that that rule does not even \u201ccom[e] into play\u201d unless\nthe suggestive circumstances are improperly \u201cpolice-arranged.\u201d\nAnte, at 2, 11.Our due process\nconcern, however, arises not from the act of suggestion, but rather\nfrom the corrosive effects of suggestion on the reliability of the\nresulting identification. By rendering protection contingent on\nimproper police arrangement of the suggestive circumstances, the\nCourt effectively grafts a mens rea inquiry onto our rule. The\nCourt\u2019s holding enshrines a murky distinction\u2014between suggestive\nconfrontations intentionally orchestrated by the police and, as\nhere, those inadvertently caused by police actions\u2014that will sow\nconfusion. It ignores our precedents\u2019 acute sensitivity to the\nhazards of intentional and unintentional suggestion alike and\nunmoors our rule from the very interest it protects, inviting\narbitrary results. And it recasts the driving force of our\ndecisions as an interest in police deterrence, rather than\nreliability. Because I see no warrant for declining to assess the\ncircumstances of this case under our ordinary approach, I\nrespectfully dissent. [1]IThe \u201cdriving force\u201d\nbehind United States v. Wade, 388 U.\u00a0S. 218 (1967) , Gilbert\nv. California, 388 U.\u00a0S. 263 (1967) , and Stovall v. Denno,\n388 U.\u00a0S. 293 (1967) , was \u201cthe Court\u2019s concern with the\nproblems of eyewitness identification\u201d\u2014specifically, \u201cthe concern\nthat the jury not hear eyewitness testimony unless that evidence\nhas aspects of reliability.\u201d Manson v. Brathwaite, 432 U.\u00a0S.\n98 \u2013112 (1977). We have pointed to the \u201c\u00a0\u2018formidable\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nnumber of \u201cmiscarriage[s] of justice from mistaken identification\u201d\nin the annals of criminal law. Wade, 388 U.\u00a0S., at 228. We\nhave warned of the \u201cvagaries\u201d and \u201c\u00a0\u2018proverbi- ally\nuntrustworthy\u2019\u00a0\u201d nature of eyewitness identifications. Ibid.\nAnd we have singled out a \u201cmajor factor contributing\u201d to that\nproverbial unreliability: \u201cthe suggestibility inherent in the\ncontext of the pretrial identification.\u201d Id., at 228, 235.Our precedents make no\ndistinction between intentional and unintentional suggestion. To\nthe contrary, they explicitly state that \u201c[s]uggestion can be\ncreated intentionally or unintentionally in many subtle ways.\u201d Id.,\nat 229. Rather than equate suggestive conduct with misconduct, we\nspecifically have disavowed the assumption that suggestive\ninfluences may only be \u201cthe result of police procedures\nintentionally designed to prejudice an accused.\u201d Id., at 235; see\nalso id., at 236 (noting \u201cgrave potential for prejudice,\nintentional or not, in the pretrial lineup\u201d); id., at 239\n(describing lack of lineup regulations addressing \u201crisks of abuse\nand unintentional suggestion\u201d). \u201cPersons who conduct the\nidentification procedure may suggest, intentionally or\nunintentionally, that they expect the witness to identify the\naccused.\u201d Moore v. Illinois, 434 U.\u00a0S. 220, 224 (1977) . The\nimplication is that even police acting with the best of intentions\ncan inadvertently signal \u201c\u00a0\u2018that\u2019s the man.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Wade, 388\nU.\u00a0S., at 236; see also Kirby v. Illinois, 406 U.\u00a0S. 682\n\u2013691 (1972) (\u201c[I]t is always necessary to \u2018scrutinize any pretrial\nconfrontation .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u2019\u00a0\u201d). [2]In Wade itself, we\nnoted that the \u201cpotential for improper influence [in pretrial\nconfrontations] is illustrated by the circumstances .\u00a0.\u00a0.\n[i]n the present case.\u201d 388 U.\u00a0S., at 233\u2013234. We then\nhighlighted not the lineup procedure, but rather a preprocedure\nencounter: The two witnesses who later identified Wade in the\nlineup had seen Wade outside while \u201cawait[ing] assembly of the\nlineup.\u201d Id., at 234. Wade had been standing in the hallway, which\nhappened to be \u201cobservable to the witnesses through an open door.\u201d\nIbid. One witness saw Wade \u201cwithin sight of an FBI agent\u201d; the\nother saw him \u201cin the custody of the agent.\u201d Ibid. In underscoring\nthe hazards of these circumstances, we made no mention of whether\nthe encounter had been arranged; indeed, the facts suggest that it\nwas not.More generally, our\nprecedents focus not on the act of suggestion, but on suggestion\u2019s\n\u201ccorrupting effect\u201d on reliability. Brathwaite, 432 U.\u00a0S., at\n114. Eyewitness evidence derived from suggestive circumstances, we\nhave explained, is uniquely resistant to the ordinary tests of the\nadversary process. An eyewitness who has made an identification\noften becomes convinced of its accuracy. \u201cRegardless of how the\ninitial misidentification comes about, the witness thereafter is\napt to retain in his memory the image of the photograph rather than\nof the person actually seen, reducing the trustworthiness of\nsubsequent .\u00a0.\u00a0. courtroom identification.\u201d Simmons v.\nUnited States, 390 U.\u00a0S. 377 \u2013384 (1968) (emphasis added); see\nalso Wade, 388 U.\u00a0S., at 229 (witness is \u201cnot likely\u201d to\nrecant). Suggestion bolsters that confidence.At trial, an\neyewitness\u2019 artificially inflated confidence in an identification\u2019s\naccuracy complicates the jury\u2019s task of assessing witness\ncredibility and reliability. It also impairs the defendant\u2019s\nability to attack the eyewitness\u2019 credibility. Stovall, 388\nU.\u00a0S., at 298. That in turn jeopardizes the defendant\u2019s basic\nright to subject his accuser to meaningful cross-examination. See\nWade, 388 U.\u00a0S., at 235 (\u201c[C]ross-examination .\u00a0.\u00a0.\ncannot be viewed as an absolute assurance of accuracy and\nreliability .\u00a0.\u00a0. where so many variables and pitfalls\nexist\u201d). The end result of suggestion, whether intentional or\nunintentional, is to fortify testimony bearing directly on guilt\nthat juries find extremely convincing and are hesitant to\ndiscredit. See id., at 224 (\u201c[A]t pretrial proceedings . . . the\nresults might well settle the accused\u2019s fate and reduce the trial\nitself to a mere formality\u201d); Gilbert, 388 U.\u00a0S., at 273\n(\u201c[T]he witness\u2019 testimony of his lineup identification will\nenhance the impact of his in-court identification on the\njury\u201d).Consistent with our\nfocus on reliability, we have declined to adopt a per se rule\nexcluding all suggestive identifications. Instead, \u201creliability is\nthe linchpin\u201d in deciding admissibility. Brathwaite, 432\nU.\u00a0S., at 114. We have explained that a suggestive\nidentification procedure \u201cdoes not in itself intrude upon a\nconstitutionally protected in-terest.\u201d Id., at 113, n.\u00a013; see\nalso Neil v. Biggers, 409 U.\u00a0S. 188 \u2013199 (1972) (rejecting the\nproposition that \u201cunnecessary suggestiveness alone requires the\nexclusion of evidence\u201d). \u201cSuggestive confrontations are disapproved\nbecause they increase the likelihood of misidentification\u201d\u2014and\n\u201c[i]t is the likelihood of misidentification which violates a\ndefendant\u2019s right to due process.\u201d Id., at 198; see also United\nStates ex\u00a0rel. Kirby v. Sturges, 510 F.\u00a02d 397, 406 (CA7\n1975) (Stevens, J.) (\u201cThe due process clause applies only to\nproceedings which result in a deprivation of life, liberty or\nproperty.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. [I]f a constitutional violation\nresults from a showup, it occurs in the courtroom, not in the\npolice station\u201d). In short, \u201c\u00a0\u2018what the Stovall due process\nright protects is an evidentiary interest.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Brathwaite, 432\nU.\u00a0S., at 113, n.\u00a014.To protect that\nevidentiary interest, we have applied a two-step inquiry: First,\nthe defendant has the burden of showing that the eyewitness\nidentification was derived through \u201cimpermissibly suggestive\u201d\nmeans. [3] Simmons, 390\nU.\u00a0S., at 384. Second, if the defendant meets that burden,\ncourts consider whether the identification was reliable under the\ntotality of the circumstances. That step entails considering the\nwitness\u2019 opportunity to view the perpetrator, degree of attention,\naccuracy of description, level of certainty, and the time between\nthe crime and pretrial confrontation, then weighing such factors\nagainst the \u201ccorrupting effect of the suggestive identification.\u201d\nBrathwaite, 432 U.\u00a0S., at 108, 114. Most identifications will\nbe admissible. The standard of \u201cfairness as required by the Due\nProcess Clause,\u201d id., at 113, however, demands that a subset of the\nmost unreliable identifications\u2014those carrying a \u201c\u00a0\u2018very\nsubstantial likelihood of .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nmisidentification\u2019\u00a0\u201d\u2014will be excluded. Biggers, 409\nU.\u00a0S., at 198.IIAThe majority today\ncreates a novel and significant limitation on our longstanding\nrule: Eyewitness identifications so impermissibly suggestive that\nthey pose a very substantial likelihood of an unreliable\nidentification will be deemed inadmissible at trial only if the\nsuggestive circumstances were \u201cpolice-arranged.\u201d Ante, at 2. Absent\n\u201cimproper police arrangement,\u201d \u201cimproper police conduct,\u201d or\n\u201crigging,\u201d the majority holds, our two-step inquiry does not even\n\u201ccom[e] into play.\u201d Ante, at 2, 11. I cannot agree.The majority does not\nsimply hold that an eyewitness identification must be the product\nof police action to trigger our ordinary two-step inquiry. Rather,\nthe majority maintains that the suggestive circumstances giving\nrise to the identification must be \u201cpolice-arranged,\u201d \u201cpolice\nrigg[ed],\u201d \u201cpolice-designed,\u201d or \u201cpolice-organized.\u201d Ante, at 2,\n12\u201313. Those terms connote a degree of intentional orchestration or\nmanipulation. See Brief for Respondent 19 (no indication that\npolice \u201cdeliberately tried to manipulate any evidence\u201d); Brief for\nUnited States as Amicus Curiae 18 (\u201c[N]o one deliberately arranged\nthe circumstances to obtain an identification\u201d). The majority\ncate-gorically exempts all eyewitness identifications derived from\nsuggestive circumstances that were not police-manipulated\u2014however\nsuggestive, and however unreliable\u2014from our due process check. The\nmajority thus appears to graft a mens rea requirement onto our\nexisting rule. [4]As this case\nillustrates, police intent is now paramount. As the Court\nacknowledges, Perry alleges an \u201caccidental showup.\u201d Brief for\nPetitioner 34 (emphasis added); see ante, at 4. He was the only\nAfrican-American at the scene of the crime standing next to a\npolice officer. For the majority, the fact that the police did not\nintend that showup, even if they inadvertently caused it in the\ncourse of a police procedure, ends the inquiry. The police were\nquestioning the eyewitness, Blandon, about the perpetrator\u2019s\nidentity, and were intentionally detaining Perry in the parking\nlot\u2014but had not intended for Blandon to identify the perpetrator\nfrom her window. Presumably, in the majority\u2019s view, had the police\nasked Blandon to move to the window to identify the perpetrator,\nthat could have made all the difference. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 32,\n37.I note, however, that\nthe majority leaves what is required by its arrangement-focused\ninquiry less than clear. In parts, the opinion suggests that the\npolice must arrange an identification \u201cprocedure,\u201d regardless of\nwhether they \u201cinten[d] the arranged procedure to be suggestive.\u201d\nAnte, at 2, n.\u00a01; see also ante, at 7\u20138. Elsewhere, it\nindicates that the police must arrange the \u201csuggestive\ncircum-stances\u201d that lead the witness to identify the accused. See\nante, at 1\u20132, 10\u201311, 18\u201319. Still elsewhere it refers to\n\u201cim-proper\u201d police conduct, ante, at 1\u20132, 9\u201312, connoting bad\nfaith. Does police \u201carrangement\u201d relate to the procedure, the\nsuggestiveness, or both? If it relates to the procedure, do\nsuggestive preprocedure encounters no longer raise the same\nconcerns? If the police need not \u201cinten[d] the arranged procedure\nto be suggestive,\u201d ante, at 2, n.\u00a01, what makes the police\naction \u201cimproper\u201d? And does that mean that good-faith,\nunintentional police suggestiveness in a police-arranged lineup can\nbe \u201cimpermissibly sugges- tive\u201d? If no, the majority runs headlong\ninto Wade. If yes, on what basis\u2014if not deterrence\u2014does it\ndistinguish unintentional police suggestiveness in an accidental\nconfrontation?The arrangement-focused\ninquiry will sow needless con-fusion. If the police had called\nPerry and Blandon to the police station for interviews, and Blandon\nsaw Perry being questioned, would that be sufficiently \u201cimproper\npolice arrangement\u201d? If Perry had voluntarily come to the police\nstation, would that change the result? Today\u2019s opinion renders the\napplicability of our ordinary inquiry contingent on a murky\nline-drawing exercise. Whereas our two-step inquiry focuses on\noverall reliability\u2014and could account for the spontaneity of the\nwitness\u2019 identification and degree of police manipulation under the\ntotal-ity of the circumstances\u2014today\u2019s opinion forecloses that\nassessment by establishing a new and inflexible step zero.BThe majority regards\nits limitation on our two-step rule as compelled by precedent. Its\nchief rationale, ante, at 7\u201313, is that none of our prior cases\ninvolved situations where the police \u201cdid not arrange the\nsuggestive circumstances.\u201d Ante, at 10; see also ante, at 2,\nn.\u00a01. That is not necessarily true, given the seemingly\nunintentional encounter highlighted in Wade. But even if it were\ntrue, it is unsurprising. The vast majority of eyewitness\nidentifications that the State uses in criminal prosecutions are\nobtained in lineup, showup, and photograph displays arranged by the\npolice. Our precedents reflect that practical reality.It is also beside the\npoint. Our due process concerns were not predicated on the source\nof suggestiveness. Rather, \u201c[i]t is the likelihood of\nmisidentification which violates a defendant\u2019s right to due\nprocess,\u201d Biggers, 409 U.\u00a0S., at 198, and we are concerned\nwith suggestion in-sofar as it has \u201ccorrupting effect[s]\u201d on the\nidentification\u2019s reliability. Brathwaite, 432 U.\u00a0S., at 114.\nAccordingly, whether the police have created the suggestive\ncircumstances intentionally or inadvertently, the resulting\nidentification raises the same due process concerns. It is no more\nor less likely to misidentify the perpetrator. It is no more or\nless powerful to the jury. And the defendant is no more or less\nequipped to challenge the identifica- tion through\ncross-examination or prejudiced at trial. The arrangement-focused\ninquiry thus untethers our doctrine from the very\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018evidentiary interest\u2019\u00a0\u201d it was designed to protect,\ninviting arbitrary results. Id., at 113, n.\u00a014.Indeed, it is the\nmajority\u2019s approach that lies in tension with our precedents.\nWhereas we previously disclaimed the crabbed view of suggestiveness\nas \u201cthe result of po- lice procedures intentionally designed to\nprejudice an ac-cused,\u201d Wade, 388 U.\u00a0S., at 235, the\nmajority\u2019s focus on police rigging and improper conduct will revive\nit. Whereas our precedents were sensitive to intentional and\nunintentional suggestiveness alike, see supra, at 2\u20133, today\u2019s\ndecision narrows our concern to intentionally orchestrated\nsuggestive confrontations. We once described the \u201cpri-mary evil to\nbe avoided\u201d as the likelihood of misidentification. Biggers, 409\nU.\u00a0S., at 198. Today\u2019s decision, however, means that even if\nthat primary evil is at its apex, we need not avoid it at all so\nlong as the suggestive circumstances do not stem from improper\npolice arrangement.CThe majority gives\nseveral additional reasons for why applying our due process rule\nbeyond improperly police-arranged circumstances is unwarranted. In\nmy view, none withstands close inspection.First, the majority\ninsists that our precedents \u201caim to deter police from rigging\nidentification procedures,\u201d so our rule should be limited to\napplications that advance that \u201cprimary aim\u201d and \u201ckey premise.\u201d\nAnte, at 2, 11 (citing Brathwaite, 432 U.\u00a0S., at 112). That\nmischaracterizes our cases. We discussed deterrence in Brathwaite\nbecause Brathwaite challenged our two-step inquiry as lacking\ndeterrence value. Brathwaite argued that deterrence de-manded a\nper\u00a0se rule excluding all suggestive identifications. He said\nthat our rule, which probes the reliability of suggestive\nidentifications under the totality of the circumstances, \u201ccannot be\nexpected to have a significant deterrent impact.\u201d Id., at 111.We rebutted\nBrathwaite\u2019s criticism in language the majority now wrenches from\ncontext: Upon summarizing Brathwaite\u2019s argument, we acknowledged\n\u201cseveral interests to be considered.\u201d Ibid. We then compared the\ntwo rules under each interest: First, we noted the \u201cdriving force\u201d\nbehind Wade and its companion cases\u2014\u201cthe concern that the jury not\nhear eyewitness testimony unless that evidence has aspects of\nreliability\u201d\u2014and found both approaches \u201cresponsive to this\nconcern,\u201d but the per\u00a0se rule to go \u201ctoo far\u201d in suppressing\nreliable evidence. 432 U.\u00a0S., at 111\u2013112. We noted a \u201csecond\nfactor\u201d\u2014deterrence\u2014conceding that the per\u00a0se rule had \u201cmore\nsignificant deterrent effect,\u201d but noting that our rule \u201calso has\nan influence on police behavior.\u201d Id., at 112. Finally, we noted a\n\u201cthird factor\u201d\u2014\u201cthe effect on the administration of\njustice\u201d\u2014describing the per\u00a0se rule as having serious\ndrawbacks on this front. Ibid. That was no list of \u201cprimary\naim[s].\u201d Nor was it a ringing endorsement of the primacy of\ndeterrence. We simply underscored, in responding to Brathwaite,\nthat our rule was not without deterrence benefits. To the contrary,\nwe clarified that deterrence was a subsidiary concern to\nreliability, the \u201cdriving force\u201d of our doctrine. It is a stretch\nto claim that our rule cannot apply wherever \u201c[t]his deterrence\nrationale is inapposite.\u201d Ante, at 11.Second, the majority\nstates that Coleman v. Alabama, 399 U.\u00a0S. 1 (1970) , held that\n\u201c[n]o due process violation occurred .\u00a0.\u00a0. because\nnothing \u2018the police said or did prompted\u2019\u00a0\u201d the identification\nand shows that our rule is linked \u201conly to improper police\narrangement.\u201d Ante, at 11\u201312. That misreads the decision. In\nColeman, the petitioners challenged a witness\u2019 in-court\nidentification of them at trial on grounds that it had been tainted\nby a suggestive pretrial lineup. We held that no due process\nviolation occurred because the in-court identification ap-peared to\nbe \u201centirely based upon observations at the time of the assault and\nnot at all induced by the conduct of the lineup,\u201d and thus could\nnot be said to stem from an identification procedure \u201c\u00a0\u2018so\nimpermissibly suggestive as to give rise to a very substantial\nlikelihood of irreparable misidentification.\u2019\u00a0\u201d 399\nU.\u00a0S., at 5\u20136 (plurality opinion). We then dismissed each of\nthe asserted suggestive influences as having had no bearing on the\nidentification at all: The petitioners claimed that the police\nintimated to the witness that his attackers were in the lineup; we\nfound the record \u201cdevoid of evidence that anything the police said\nor did\u201d induced the identification. Id., at 6. The petitioners\nclaimed that they alone were made to say certain words; we found\nthat the witness identified petitioners before either said\nanything. One petitioner claimed he was singled out to wear a hat;\nwe found that the witness\u2019 identification \u201cd[id] not appear\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. based on the fact that he remembered that [the\nattacker] had worn a hat.\u201d Ibid. Thus, far from indicating that\nimproper police conduct is a prerequisite, Coleman merely held that\nthere had been no influence on the witness. In fact, in concluding\nthat the lineup was not \u201c\u00a0\u2018so impermissibly suggestive as to\ngive rise to a very substantial likelihood of irreparable\nmisidentification,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Coleman indicates that the two-step\ninquiry is not truncated at the threshold by the absence of police\nmisconduct.Third, the majority\nemphasizes that we should rely on the jury to determine the\nreliability of evidence. See ante, at 15\u201316. But our cases are\nrooted in the assumption that eyewitness identifications upend the\nordinary expectation that it is \u201cthe province of the jury to weigh\nthe credibility of competing witnesses.\u201d Kansas v. Ventris, 556\nU.\u00a0S. 586 , n. (2009). As noted, jurors find eyewitness\nevidence unusually powerful and their ability to assess credibility\nis hindered by a witness\u2019 false confidence in the accuracy of his\nor her identification. That disability in no way de-pends on the\nintent behind the suggestive circumstances.The majority\u2019s appeals\nto protecting the jury\u2019s domain, moreover, appeared in dissent\nafter dissent from our de-cisions. See Foster v. California, 394 U.\nS. 440, 447 (1969) (Black, J., dissenting) (\u201c[T]he jury is the sole\ntribunal to weigh and determine facts\u201d and \u201cmust . . . be allowed\nto hear eyewitnesses and decide for itself whether it can recognize\nthe truth\u201d); Simmons, 390 U. S., at 395 (Black, J., concurring in\npart and dissenting in part) (\u201cThe weight of the evidence . . . is\nnot a question for the Court but for the jury\u201d). So too does the\nmajority\u2019s assurance that other constitutional protections like the\nSixth Amendment rights to compulsory process and confrontation can\nsuffice to expose unreliable identifications. Compare ante, at 6,\nwith Foster, 394 U.\u00a0S., at 448\u2013449 (Black, J., dissenting)\n(\u201cThe Constitution sets up its own standards of unfairness in\ncriminal trials,\u201d including the Sixth Amendment \u201cright to\ncompulsory process\u201d and \u201cright to confront .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nwitnesses\u201d). So too does the majority\u2019s appeal to leave reliability\nto the rules of evidence. Compare ante, at 17, with Foster, 394\nU.\u00a0S., at 448 (Black, J., dissenting) (\u201c\u00a0\u2018Rules of\nevidence are designed in the interests of fair trials\u2019\u00a0\u201d), and\nStovall, 388 U.\u00a0S., at 306 (Black, J., dissenting) (\u201c[T]he\nresult .\u00a0.\u00a0. is to put into a constitutional mould a rule\nof evidence\u201d). Those arguments did not prevail then; they should\nnot prevail here.Fourth, the majority\nsuggests that applying our rule beyond police-arranged suggestive\ncircumstances would entail a heavy practical burden, requiring\ncourts to engage in \u201cpreliminary judicial inquiry\u201d into \u201cmost, if\nnot all, eyewitness identifications.\u201d Ante, at 13, 18. But that is\ninaccurate. The burden of showing \u201cimpermissibly suggestive\u201d\ncircumstances is the defendant\u2019s, so the objection falls to the\ndefendant to raise. And as is implicit in the majority\u2019s\nreassurance that Perry may resort to the rules of evidence in lieu\nof our due process precedents, trial courts will be entertaining\ndefendants\u2019 objections, pretrial or at trial, to unreliable\neyewitness evidence in any event. The relevant question, then, is\nwhat the standard of admissibility governing such objections should\nbe. I see no reason to water down the standard for an equally\nsuggestive and unreliable identification simply because the\nsuggestive confrontation was unplanned.It bears reminding,\nmoreover, that we set a high bar for suppression. The vast majority\nof eyewitnesses proceed to testify before a jury. To date, Foster\nis the only case in which we have found a due process violation.\n394 U.\u00a0S., at 443. There has been no flood of claims in the\nfour Federal Circuits that, having seen no basis for an\narrangement-based distinction in our precedents, have long\nindicated that due process scrutiny applies to all suggestive\nidentification procedures. See Dunnigan v. Keane, 137 F. 3d 117,\n128 (CA2 1998); United States v. Bouthot, 878 F. 2d 1506, 1516 (CA1\n1989); Thigpen v. Cory, 804 F. 2d 893, 895 (CA6 1986); see also\nGreen v. Loggins, 614 F. 2d 219, 223 (CA9 1980). Today\u2019s decision\nnonetheless precludes even the possibility that an unintended\nconfrontation will meet that bar, mandating summary dismissal of\nevery such claim at the threshold.Finally, the majority\nquestions how to \u201crationally distinguish suggestiveness from other\nfactors bearing on the reliability of eyewitness evidence,\u201d such as\n\u201cpoor vision\u201d or a prior \u201cgrudge,\u201d ante, at 13\u201314, and more\nbroadly, how to distinguish eyewitness evidence from other kinds of\narguably unreliable evidence. Ante, at 14\u201315. Our precedents,\nhowever, did just that. We emphasized the \u201c\u00a0\u2018formidable number\nof instances in the records of English and Amer-ican trials\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nof \u201cmiscarriage[s] of justice from mistaken identification.\u201d Wade,\n388 U.\u00a0S., at 228. We then observed that \u201c\u00a0\u2018the influence\nof improper suggestion upon identifying witnesses probably accounts\nfor more miscarriages of justice than any other single\nfactor.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Id., at 229. More-over, the majority points to no\nother type of evidence that shares the rare confluence of\ncharacteristics that makes eyewitness evidence a unique threat to\nthe fairness of trial. Jailhouse informants, cf. ante, at 15,\nunreliable as they may be, are not similarly resistant to the\ntraditional tools of the adversarial process and, if anything, are\nmet with particular skepticism by juries.It would be one thing\nif the passage of time had cast doubt on the empirical premises of\nour precedents. But just the opposite has happened. A vast body of\nscientific literature has reinforced every concern our precedents\narticulated nearly a half-century ago, though it merits barely a\nparenthetical mention in the majority opinion. Ante, at 14. Over\nthe past three decades, more than two thousand studies related to\neyewitness identification have been published. One state supreme\ncourt recently appointed a special master to conduct an exhaustive\nsurvey of the current state of the scientific evidence and\nconcluded that \u201c[t]he research .\u00a0.\u00a0. is not only\nextensive,\u201d but \u201cit represents the \u2018gold standard in terms of the\napplicability of social science research to law.\u2019\u00a0\u201d State v.\nHenderson, 208 N.\u00a0J. 208, 283, 27 A. 3d 872, 916 (2011).\n\u201cExperimental methods and findings have been tested and retested,\nsubjected to scientific scrutiny through peer-reviewed journals,\nevaluated through the lens of meta-analyses, and replicated at\ntimes in real-world settings.\u201d Ibid.; see also Schmechel, O\u2019Toole,\nEasterly, & Loftus, Beyond the Ken? Testing Jurors\u2019\nUnderstanding of Eyewitness Reliability Evidence, 46 Jurimetrics\n177, 180 (2006) (noting \u201cnearly unanimous consensus among\nresearchers about the [eyewitness reliability] field\u2019s core\nfindings\u201d).The empirical evidence\ndemonstrates that eyewitness misidentification is \u201c\u00a0\u2018the\nsingle greatest cause of wrongful convictions in this\ncountry.\u2019\u00a0\u201d [5]\nResearchers have found that a staggering 76% of the first 250\nconvictions overturned due to DNA evidence since 1989 involved\neyewitness misidentification. [6] Study after study demonstrates that eyewitness\nrecollections are highly susceptible to distortion by postevent\ninformation or social cues; [7] that jurors routinely overestimate the accuracy of eyewitness\nidentifications; [8] that\njurors place the greatest weight on eyewitness confidence in\nassessing identifications [9]\neven though confidence is a poor gauge of accuracy; [10] and that suggestiveness can\nstem from sources beyond police-orchestrated procedures. [11] The majority today\nnever-theless adopts an artificially narrow conception of the\ndangers of suggestive identifications at a time when our concerns\nshould have deepened.IIIThere are many\nreasons why Perry\u2019s particular situation might not violate due\nprocess. The trial court found that the circumstances surrounding\nBlandon\u2019s identification did not rise to an impermissibly\nsuggestive level. It is not at all clear, moreover, that there was\na very substantial likelihood of misidentification, given Blandon\u2019s\nlack of equivocation on the scene, the short time between crime and\nconfrontation, and the \u201cfairly well lit\u201d parking lot. App. 56. The\nNew Hampshire Supreme Court, however, never made findings on either\npoint and, under the majority\u2019s decision today, never will.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*The Court\u2019s opinion\ntoday renders the defendant\u2019s due process protection contingent on\nwhether the suggestive circumstances giving rise to the eyewitness\nidentification stem from improper police arrangement. That view\nlies in tension with our precedents\u2019 more holistic conception of\nthe dangers of suggestion and is untethered from the evidentiary\ninterest the due process right protects. In my view, the ordinary\ntwo-step inquiry should apply, whether the police created the\nsuggestive circumstances intentionally or inadvertently. Because\nthe New Hampshire Supreme Court truncated its inquiry at the\nthreshold, I would vacate the judgment and remand for a proper\nanalysis. I respectfully dissent.Notes1Because the facts of this\ncase involve police action, I do not reach the question whether due\nprocess is triggered in situations involving no police action\nwhatsoever.2Wade held that the\ndangers of pretrial identification procedures necessitated a right\nto counsel; that same day, Stovall held that a defendant ineligible\nfor the Wade rule was still entitled to challenge the confrontation\nas a due process violation. Because the two were companion cases\nadvancing interrelated rules to avoid unfairness at trial resulting\nfrom suggestive pretrial confrontations, Wade\u2019s exposition of the\ndangers of suggestiveness informs both contexts. See Manson v.\nBrathwaite, (\u201cWade and its companion cases reflect the concern that\nthe jury not hear eyewitness testimony unless that evidence has\naspects of reliability\u201d).3Our precedents refer to\n\u201cimpermissibly,\u201d \u201cunnecessarily,\u201d and \u201cunduly\u201d suggestive\ncircumstances interchangeably. See, e.g., Brathwaite, 432\nU.\u00a0S., at 105, n.\u00a08, 107\u2013108, 110, 112\u2013113\n(\u201cimpermissibly\u201d and \u201cunnecessarily\u201d); Neil v. Biggers, \u2013199 (1972)\n(\u201cimpermissibly\u201d and \u201cunnecessarily\u201d); Coleman v. Alabama, \u20135\n(1970) (\u201cunduly\u201d and \u201cimpermissibly\u201d); Simmons v. United States,\n\u2013384 (1968) (\u201cunduly\u201d and \u201cimpermissibly\u201d). The Circuits have\nfollowed suit. E.g., Thigpen v. Cory, 804 F.\u00a02d 893, 895 (CA6\n1986) (\u201cunduly\u201d); Green v. Loggins, 614 F.\u00a02d 219, 223 (CA9\n1980) (\u201cunnecessarily or impermissibly\u201d). All reinforce our focus\nnot on the act of suggestion, but on whether the suggestiveness\nrises to such a level that it undermines reliability. Police\nmachinations can heighten the likelihood of misidentification, but\nthey are no prerequisite to finding a confrontation \u201cso\nimpermissibly suggestive as to give rise to a very substantial\nlikelihood of .\u00a0.\u00a0. misidentification.\u201d Simmons, 390\nU.\u00a0S., at 384.4The majority denies that\nit has imposed a mens rea requirement, see ante, at 2, n.\u00a01,\nbut by confining our due process concerns to police-arranged\nidentification procedures, that is just what it has done. The\nmajority acknowledges that \u201cwhether or not [the police] intended\nthe arranged procedure to be suggestive\u201d is irrelevant under our\nprecedents, ibid., but still places dispositive weight on whether\nor not the police intended the procedure itself.5State v.
