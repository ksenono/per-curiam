But, I disagree with the\nmajority\u2019s decision to reach the merits of the probable-cause\nquestion, which it does apparently only to ensure that, in addition\nto respondents\u2019 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71983 claims, the Court\u2019s\ndecision will resolve respondents\u2019 state-law claims of false arrest\nand negligent su- pervision. Seeante,at 13,\nn.\u00a07.It is possible that our qualified-immunity\ndecision alone will resolve those claims. See Reply Brief 20,\nn.\u00a07. In light of the lack of a dispute on an important legal\nquestion and the heavily factbound nature of the probable-cause\ndetermination here, I do not think that the Court should have\nreached that issue. The lower courts are well equipped to handle\nthe remaining state-law claims in the first instance.",
