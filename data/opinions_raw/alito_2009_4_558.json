VAN\nHOOKon petition for writ of certiorari to the united\nstates court of appeals for the sixth circuitNo. 09\u2013144.\u2003Decided November 9, 2009Justice Alito, concurring.I join the Court\u2019sper\ncuriamopinion but emphasize my understanding that the opinion\nin no way suggests that the American Bar Association\u2019s Guidelines\nfor the Appointment and Performance of Defense Counsel in Death\nPenalty Cases (rev. ed. 2003) (2003 Guidelines or ABA Guidelines)\nhave special relevance in determining whether an attorney\u2019s\nperformance meets the standard required by the Sixth Amendment. The\nABA is a venerable organization with a history of service to the\nbar, but it is, after all, a private group with limited membership.\nThe views of the association\u2019s members, not to mention the views of\nthe members of the advisory committee that formulated the 2003\nGuidelines, do not necessarily reflect the views of the American\nbar as a whole. It is the responsibility of the courts to determine\nthe nature of the work that a defense attorney must do in a capital\ncase in order to meet the obligations imposed by the Constitution,\nand I see no reason why the ABA Guidelines should be given a\nprivileged position in making that determination.",
