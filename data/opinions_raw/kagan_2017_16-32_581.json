In the decision below, the\nKentucky Supreme Court declined to give effect to two arbitration\nagreements executed by individuals holding \u201cpowers of\nattorney\u201d\u2014that is, authorizations to act on behalf of others.\nAccording to the court, a general grant of power (even if seemingly\ncomprehensive) does not permit a legal representative to enter into\nan arbitration agreement for someone else; to form such a contract,\nthe representative must possess specific authority to \u201cwaive his\nprincipal\u2019s fundamental constitutional rights to access the courts\n[and] to trial by jury.\u201dExtendicare Homes, Inc.v.Whisman, 478 S.\u00a0W.\u00a03d 306, 327 (2015). Because\nthat rule singles out arbitration agreements for disfavored\ntreatment, we hold that it violates the FAA.IPetitioner Kindred Nursing Centers L.\u00a0P.\noperates nursing homes and rehabilitation centers. Respondents\nBeverly Wellner and Janis Clark are the wife and daughter,\nrespectively, of Joe Wellner and Olive Clark, two now-deceased\nresidents of a Kindred nursing home called the Winchester\nCentre.At all times relevant to this case, Beverly and\nJanis each held a power of attorney, designating her as an\n\u201cattorney-in-fact\u201d (the one for Joe, the other for Olive) and\naffording her broad authority to manage her family member\u2019s\naffairs. In the Wellner power of attorney, Joe gave Beverly the\nauthority, \u201cin my name, place and stead,\u201d to (among other things)\n\u201cinstitute legal proceedings\u201d and make \u201ccontracts of every nature\nin relation to both real and personal property.\u201d App. 10\u201311. In the\nClark power of attorney, Olive provided Janis with \u201cfull power\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. to transact, handle, and dispose of all matters\naffecting me and/or my estate in any possible way,\u201d including the\npower to \u201cdraw, make, and sign in my name any and all\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. contracts, deeds, or agreements.\u201dId.,at\n7.Joe and Olive moved into the Winchester Centre\nin 2008, with Beverly and Janis using their powers of attorney to\ncomplete all necessary paperwork. As part of that process, Beverly\nand Janis each signed an arbitration agreement with Kindred on\nbehalf of her relative. The two contracts, worded identically,\nprovided that \u201c[a]ny and all claims or controversies arising out of\nor in any way relating to .\u00a0.\u00a0. the Resident\u2019s stay at\nthe Facility\u201d would be resolved through \u201cbinding arbitration\u201d\nrather than a lawsuit.Id.,at 14, 21.When Joe and Olive died the next year, their\nestates (represented again by Beverly and Janis) brought separate\nsuits against Kindred in Kentucky state court. The complaints\nalleged that Kindred had delivered substandard care to Joe and\nOlive, causing their deaths. Kindred moved to dismiss the cases,\narguing that the arbitration agreements Beverly and Janis had\nsigned prohibited bringing their disputes to court. But the trial\ncourt denied Kindred\u2019s motions, and the Kentucky Court of Appeals\nagreed that the estates\u2019 suits could go forward. See App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 125a\u2013126a, 137a\u2013138a.The Kentucky Supreme Court, after consolidating\nthe cases, affirmed those decisions by a divided vote. See 478\nS.\u00a0W.\u00a03d, at 313. The court began with the language of\nthe two powers of attorney. The Wellner document, the court stated,\ndid not permit Beverly to enter into an arbitration agreement on\nJoe\u2019s behalf. In the court\u2019s view, neither the provision\nauthorizing her to bring legal proceedings nor the one enabling her\nto make property-related contracts reached quite that distance. Seeid.,at 325\u2013326;supra,at 2. By contrast, the court\nthought, the Clark power of attorney extended that far and beyond.\nUnder that document, after all, Janis had the capacity to \u201cdispose\nof all matters\u201d affecting Olive. Seesupra,at 2. \u201cGiven\nthis extremely broad, universal delegation of authority,\u201d the court\nacknowledged, \u201cit would be impossible to say that entering into\n[an] arbitration agreement was not covered.\u201d 478\nS.\u00a0W.\u00a03d, at 327.And yet, the court went on, both arbitration\nagreements\u2014Janis\u2019s no less than Beverly\u2019s\u2014were invalid. That was\nbecause a power of attorney could not entitle a representative to\nenter into an arbitration agreement withoutspecificallysaying so. The Kentucky Constitution, the court explained, protects\nthe rights of access to the courts and trial by jury; indeed, the\njury guarantee is the sole right the Constitution declares \u201csacred\u201d\nand \u201cinviolate.\u201dId.,at 328\u2013329. Accordingly, the court\nheld, an agent could deprive her principal of an \u201cadjudication by\njudge or jury\u201d only if the power of attorney \u201cexpressly so\nprovide[d].\u201dId.,at 329. And that clear-statement rule\u2014so\nsaid the court\u2014complied with the FAA\u2019s demands. True enough that\nthe Act precludes \u201csingl[ing] out arbitration agreements.\u201dIbid.(internal quotation marks omitted). But that was no\nproblem, the court asserted, because its rule would apply not just\nto those agreements, but also to some other contracts implicating\n\u201cfundamental constitutional rights.\u201dId.,at 328. In the\nfuture, for example, the court would bar the holder of a\n\u201cnon-specific\u201d power of attorney from entering into a contract\n\u201cbind[ing] the principal to personal servitude.\u201dIbid.Justice Abramson dissented, in an opinion joined\nby two of her colleagues. In their view, the Kentucky Supreme\nCourt\u2019s new clear-statement rule was \u201cclearly not .\u00a0.\u00a0.\napplicable to \u2018any contract\u2019 but [instead] single[d] out\narbitration agreements for disfavored treatment.\u201dId.,at\n344\u2013345. Accordingly, the dissent concluded, the rule \u201cr[a]n afoul\nof the FAA.\u201dId.,at 353.We granted certiorari. 580 U.\u00a0S. ___\n(2016).IIAThe FAA makes arbitration agreements \u201cvalid,\nirrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at\nlaw or in equity for the revocation of any contract.\u201d 9\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72. That statutory provision establishes an\nequal-treatment principle: A court may invalidate an arbitration\nagreement based on \u201cgenerally applicable contract defenses\u201d like\nfraud or unconscionability, but not on legal rules that \u201capply only\nto arbitration or that derive their meaning from the fact that an\nagreement to arbitrate is at issue.\u201dAT&T Mobility LLCv.Concepcion, 563 U.\u00a0S. 333, 339 (2011) . The FAA thus\npreempts any state rule discriminating on its face against\narbitration\u2014for example, a \u201claw prohibit[ing] outright the\narbitration of a particular type of claim.\u201dId.,at 341. And\nnot only that: The Act also displaces any rule that covertly\naccomplishes the same objective by disfavoring contracts that (oh\nso coinciden-tally) have the defining features of arbitration\nagreements. InConcepcion, for example, we described a\nhypothetical state law declaring unenforceable any contract that\n\u201cdisallow[ed] an ultimate disposition [of a dispute] by a jury.\u201dId.,at 342. Such a law might avoid referring to arbitration\nby name; but still, we explained, it would \u201crely on the uniqueness\nof an agreement to arbitrate as [its] basis\u201d\u2014and thereby violate\nthe FAA.Id.,at 341 (quotingPerryv.Thomas,\n482 U.\u00a0S. 483 , n.\u00a09 (1987)).The Kentucky Supreme Court\u2019s clear-statement\nrule, in just that way, fails to put arbitration agreements on an\nequal plane with other contracts. By the court\u2019s own account, that\nrule (like the oneConcepcionposited) serves to safeguard a\nperson\u2019s \u201cright to access the courts and to trial by jury.\u201d 478\nS.\u00a0W.\u00a03d, at 327; seesupra,at 3\u20134. In ringing\nterms, the court affirmed the jury right\u2019s unsurpassed standing in\nthe State Constitution: The framers, the court explained,\nrecognized \u201cthat right and that right alone as a divine God-given\nright\u201d when they made it \u201ctheonlything\u201d that must be\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018held sacred\u2019\u00a0\u201d and \u201c\u00a0\u2018inviolate.\u2019\u00a0\u201d 478\nS.\u00a0W.\u00a03d, at 328\u2013329 (quoting Ky. Const. \u00a77). So it was\nthat the court required an explicit statement before an\nattorney-in-fact, even if possessing broad delegated powers, could\nrelinquish that right on another\u2019s behalf. See 478\nS.\u00a0W.\u00a03d, at 331 (\u201cWe say only that an agent\u2019s authority\nto waive his principal\u2019s constitutional right to access the courts\nand to trial by jury must be clearly expressed by the principal\u201d).\nAnd so it was that the court did exactly whatConcepcionbarred: adopt a legal rule hinging on the primary characteristic of\nan arbitration agreement\u2014namely, a waiver of the right to go to\ncourt and receive a jury trial. See 563 U.\u00a0S., at 341\u2013342; see\nalso 478 S.\u00a0W.\u00a03d, at 353 (Abramson, J., dissenting)\n(noting that the jury-trial right at the core of \u201cthe majority\u2019s\nnew rule\u201d is \u201cthe one right that just happens to be correlative to\nthe right to arbitrate\u201d (emphasis deleted)). Such a rule is too\ntailor-made to arbitration agreements\u2014subjecting them, by virtue of\ntheir defining trait, to uncommon barriers\u2014to survive the FAA\u2019s\nedict against singling out those contracts for disfavored\ntreatment.[1]And the state court\u2019s sometime-attempt to cast\nthe rule in broader terms cannot salvage its decision. The\nclear-statement requirement, the court suggested, could also apply\nwhen an agent endeavored to waive other \u201cfundamental constitutional\nrights\u201d held by a principal. 478 S.\u00a0W.\u00a03d, at 331; seesupra,at 4. But what other rights, really? No Kentucky\ncourt, so far as we know, has ever before demanded that a power of\nattorney explicitly confer authority to enter into contracts\nimplicating constitutional guarantees. Nor did the opinion below\nindicate that such a grant would be needed for the many routine\ncontracts\u2014executed day in and day out by legal\nrepresentatives\u2014meeting that description. For example, the Kentucky\nConstitution protects the \u201cinherent and inalienable\u201d rights to\n\u201cacquir[e] and protect[\u00a0] property\u201d and to \u201cfreely\ncommunicat[e] thoughts and opinions.\u201d Ky. Const. \u00a71. But the state\ncourt nowhere cautioned that an attorney-in-fact would now need a\nspecific authorization to, say, sell her principal\u2019s furniture or\ncommit her principal to a non-disclosure agreement. (And were we in\nthe business of giving legal advice, we would tell the agent not to\nworry.) Rather, the court hypothesized a slim set of both patently\nobjectionable and utterly fanciful contracts that would be subject\nto its rule: No longer could a representative lacking explicit\nauthorization waive her \u201cprincipal\u2019s right to worship freely\u201d or\n\u201cconsent to an arranged marriage\u201d or \u201cbind [her] principal to\npersonal servitude.\u201d 478 S.\u00a0W.\u00a03d, at 328; seesupra,at 4. Placing arbitration agreements within that\nclass reveals the kind of \u201chostility to arbitration\u201d that led\nCongress to enact the FAA.Concepcion, 563 U.\u00a0S., at\n339. And doing so only makes clear the arbitration-specific\ncharacter of the rule, much as if it were made applicable to\narbitration agreements and black swans.[2]BThe respondents, Janis and Beverly, primarily\nadvance a different argument\u2014based on the distinction between\ncontract formation and contract enforcement\u2014to support the decision\nbelow. Kentucky\u2019s clear-statement rule, they begin, affects only\ncontract formation, because it bars agents without explicit\nauthority from entering into arbitration agreements. And in their\nview, the FAA has \u201cno application\u201d to \u201ccontract formation issues.\u201d\nSupp. Brief for Respondents 1. The Act, to be sure, requires a\nState to enforce all arbitration agreements (save on generally\napplicable grounds) once they have come into being. But, the\nrespondents claim, States have free rein to decide\u2014irrespective of\nthe FAA\u2019s equal-footing principle\u2014whether such contracts are\nvalidly created in the first instance. Seeid.,at 3 (\u201cThe\nFAA\u2019s statutory framework applies onlyaftera court has\ndetermined that a valid arbitration agreement was formed\u201d).Both the FAA\u2019s text and our case law\ninterpreting it say otherwise. The Act\u2019s key provision, once again,\nstates that an arbitration agreement must ordinarily be treated as\n\u201cvalid, irrevocable, and enforceable.\u201d 9 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72; seesupra, at 4. By its terms, then, the Act cares not only\nabout the \u201cenforce[ment]\u201d of arbitration agreements, but also about\ntheir initial \u201cvalid[ity]\u201d\u2014that is, about what it takes to enter\ninto them. Or said otherwise: A rule selectively finding\narbitration contracts invalid because improperly formed fares no\nbetter under the Act than a rule selectively refusing to enforce\nthose agreements once properly made. Precedent confirms that point.\nInConcepcion, we noted the impermissibility of applying a\ncontract defense like duress \u201cin a fashion that disfavors\narbitration.\u201d 563 U.\u00a0S., at 341. But the doctrine of duress,\nas we have elsewhere explained, involves \u201cunfair dealing at the\ncontract formation stage.\u201dMorgan Stanley Capital Group Inc.v.Public Util. Dist. No. 1 of Snohomish Cty., 554\nU.\u00a0S. 527, 547 (2008) . Our discussion of duress would have\nmade no sense if the FAA, as the respondents contend, had nothing\nto say about contract formation.And still more: Adopting the respondents\u2019 view\nwould make it trivially easy for States to undermine the\nAct\u2014indeed, to wholly defeat it. As the respondents have\nacknowledged, their reasoning would allow States to pronounceanyattorney-in-fact incapable of signing an arbitration\nagreement\u2014even if a power of attorney specifically authorized her\nto do so. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 27. (After all, such a rule would\nspeak to only the contract\u2019s formation.) And why stop there? If the\nrespondents were right, States could just as easily declareeveryoneincompetent to sign arbitration agreements. (That\nrule too would address only formation.) The FAA would then mean\nnothing at all\u2014its provisions rendered helpless to prevent even the\nmost blatant discrimination against arbitration.IIIAs we did just last Term, we once again \u201creach\na conclusion that .\u00a0.\u00a0. falls well within the confines of\n(and goes no further than) present well-established law.\u201dDIRECTV, 577 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 10). The\nKentucky Supreme Court specially impeded the ability of\nattorneys-in-fact to enter into arbitration agreements. The court\nthus flouted the FAA\u2019s command to place those agreements on an\nequal footing with all other contracts.Our decision requires reversing the Kentucky\nSupreme Court\u2019s judgment in favor of the Clark estate. As noted\nearlier, the state court held that the Clark power of attorney was\nsufficiently broad to cover executing an arbitration agreement. Seesupra,at 3. The court invalidated the agreement with\nKindred only because the power of attorney did not specifically\nauthorize Janis to enter into it on Olive\u2019s behalf. In other words,\nthe decision below was based exclusively on the clear-statement\nrule that we have held violates the FAA. So the court must now\nenforce the Clark-Kindred arbitration agreement.By contrast, our decision might not require such\na result in the Wellner case. The Kentucky Supreme Court began its\nopinion by stating that the Wellner power of attorney was\ninsufficiently broad to give Beverly the authority to execute an\narbitration agreement for Joe. Seesupra,at 3. If that\ninterpretation of the document is wholly independent of the court\u2019s\nclear-statement rule, then nothing we have said disturbs it. But if\nthat rule at all influenced the construction of the Wellner power\nof attorney, then the court must evaluate the document\u2019s meaning\nanew. The court\u2019s opinion leaves us uncertain as to whether such an\nimpermissible taint occurred. We therefore vacate the judgment\nbelow and return the case to the state court for further\nconsideration. SeeMarmet Health Care Center, Inc.v.Brown, 565 U.\u00a0S. 530, 534 (2012) (per curiam)\n(vacating and remanding another arbitration decision because we\ncould not tell \u201cto what degree [an] alternative holding was\ninfluenced by\u201d the state court\u2019s erroneous, arbitration-specific\nrule). On remand, the court should determine whether it adheres, in\nthe absence of its clear-statement rule, to its prior reading of\nthe Wellner power of attorney.For these reasons, we reverse in part and vacate\nin part the judgment of the Kentucky Supreme Court, and we remand\nthe case for further proceedings not inconsistent with this\nopinion.It is so ordered.Justice Gorsuch took no part in the\nconsideration or decision of this case.Notes1Making matters worse, the\nKentucky Supreme Court\u2019s clear-statement rule appears not to apply\nto other kinds of agreements relinquishing the right to go to court\nor obtain a jury trial. Nothing in the decision below (or elsewhere\nin Kentucky law) suggests that explicit authorization is needed\nbefore an attorney-in-fact can sign a settlement agreement or\nconsent to a bench trial on her principal\u2019s behalf. See 478\nS.\u00a0W.\u00a03d, at 325 (discussing the Wellner power of\nattorney\u2019s provision for \u201cmanaging a claim in litigation\u201d without\ninsisting that such commitments would require a clearer grant).\nMark that as yet another indication that the court\u2019s demand for\nspecificity in powers of attorney arises from the suspect status of\narbitration rather than the sacred status of jury\ntrials.2We do not suggest that a\nstate court is precluded from announcing a new, generally\napplicable rule of law in an arbitration case. We simply reiterate\nhere what we have said many times before\u2014that the rule must in fact\napply generally, rather than single out arbitration.",
