S. ____ (2010)SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESNO. 08-1224UNITED STATES, PETITIONERv.GRAYDON EARL\nCOMSTOCK, Jr., et\u00a0al.on writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the fourth circuit[May 17, 2010]Justice Thomas, with whom Justice\nScalia joins in all but Part III\u2013A\u20131\u2013b, dissenting.The Court holds today that\nCongress has power under the Necessary and Proper Clause to enact a\nlaw authorizing the Federal Government to civilly commit \u201csexually\ndangerous person[s]\u201d beyond the date it lawfully could hold them on\na charge or conviction for a federal crime. 18 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a74248(a). I disagree. The Necessary and Proper Clause empowers\nCongress to enact only those laws that \u201ccarr[y] into Execution\u201d one\nor more of the federal powers enumerated in the Constitution.\nArt.\u00a0I, \u00a78, cl.\u00a018. Because \u00a74248 \u201cExecut[es]\u201d no\nenumerated power, I must respectfully dissent.I\u201cAs every schoolchild learns, our\nConstitution establishes a system of dual sovereignty between the\nStates and the Federal Government.\u201dGregoryv.Ashcroft,501 U. S. 452, 457\n(1991). In our system, the Federal Government\u2019s powers are\nenumerated, and hence limited. See,e.g.,McCullochv.Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 405 (1819)\n(\u201cThis government is acknowledged by all to be one of enumerated\npowers\u201d). Thus, Congress has no power to act unless the\nConstitution authorizes it to do so.United Statesv.Morrison,529 U. S. 598, 607\n(2000) (\u201cEvery law enacted by Congress must be based on one or more\nof its powers enumerated in the Constitution\u201d). The States, in\nturn, are free to exercise all powers that the Constitution does\nnot withhold from them. Amdt. 10 (\u201cThe powers not delegated to the\nUnited States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the\nStates, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the\npeople\u201d).[Footnote 1] This\nconstitutional structure establishes different default rules for\nCongress and the States: Congress\u2019 powers are \u201cfew and defined,\u201d\nwhile those that belong to the States \u201cremain . . . numerous and\nindefinite.\u201d The Federalist No. 45, p. 328 (B. Wright ed. 1961) (J.\nMadison).The Constitution plainly sets\nforth the \u201cfew and defined\u201d powers that Congress may exercise.\nArticle I \u201cvest[s]\u201d in Congress \u201c[a]ll legislative Powers herein\ngranted,\u201d \u00a71, and carefully enumerates those powers in \u00a78. The\nfinal clause of \u00a78, the Necessary and Proper Clause, authorizes\nCongress \u201c[t]o make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper\nfor carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers, and all other\nPowers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United\nStates, or in any Department or Officer thereof.\u201d Art.\u00a0I, \u00a78,\ncl. 18. As the Clause\u2019s placement at the end of \u00a78 indicates, the\n\u201cforegoing Powers\u201d are those granted to Congress in the preceding\nclauses of that section. The \u201cother Powers\u201d to which the Clause\nrefers are those \u201cvested\u201d in Congress and the other branches by\nother specific provisions of the Constitution.Chief Justice Marshall famously summarized\nCongress\u2019 authority under the Necessary and Proper Clause inMcCulloch, which has stood for nearly 200 years as this\nCourt\u2019s definitive interpretation of that text:\u201cLet the end be legitimate, let it be within the\nscope of the constitution, and all means which are appropriate,\nwhich are plainly adapted to that end, which are not prohibited,\nbut consist with the letter and spirit of the constitution, are\nconstitutional.\u201d 4 Wheat., at 421.McCulloch\u2019s summation is\ndescriptive of the Clause itself, providing that federal\nlegislation is a valid exercise of Congress\u2019 authority under the\nClause if it satisfies a two-part test: First, the law must be\ndirected toward a \u201clegitimate\u201d end, whichMcCullochdefines as one \u201cwithin the scope of the [C]onstitution\u201d\u2014that is,\nthe powers expressly delegated to the Federal Government by some\nprovision in the Constitution. Second, there must be a necessary\nand proper fit between the \u201cmeans\u201d (the federal law) and the \u201cend\u201d\n(the enumerated power or powers) it is designed to serve.Ibid.\nMcCullochaccords Congress a certain amount of discretion in\nassessing means-end fit under this second inquiry. The means\nCongress selects will be deemed \u201cnecessary\u201d if they are\n\u201cappropriate\u201d and \u201cplainly adapted\u201d to the exercise of an\nenumerated power, and \u201cproper\u201d if they are not otherwise\n\u201cprohibited\u201d by the Constitution and not \u201c[in]consistent\u201d with its\n\u201cletter and spirit.\u201dIbid.Critically, however,McCullochunderscores the linear relationship the Clause establishes between\nthe two inquiries: Unless the end itself is \u201clegitimate,\u201d the fit\nbetween means and end is irrelevant. In other words, no matter how\n\u201cnecessary\u201d or \u201cproper\u201d an Act of Congress may be to its objective,\nCongress lacks authority to legislate if the objective is anything\nother than \u201ccarrying into Execution\u201d one or more of the Federal\nGovernment\u2019s enumerated powers. Art.\u00a0I, \u00a78, cl. 18.This limitation was of utmost importance to\nthe Framers. During the State ratification debates,\nAnti-Federalists expressed concern that the Necessary and Proper\nClause would give Congress virtually unlimited power. See,e.g., Essays of Brutus, in 2 The Complete Anti-Federalist\n421 (H. Storing ed. 1981). Federalist supporters of the\nConstitution swiftly refuted that charge, explaining that the\nClause did not grant Congress any freestanding authority, but\ninstead made explicit what was already implicit in the grant of\neach enumerated power. Referring to the \u201cpowers declared in the\nConstitution,\u201d Alexander Hamilton noted that \u201cit isexpresslyto execute these powers that the sweeping clause\n. . . authorizes the national legislature to pass allnecessaryandproperlaws.\u201d The Federalist No.\n33, at 245. James Madison echoed this view, stating that \u201cthe\nsweeping clause . . . only extend[s] to the enumerated powers.\u201d 3\nJ. Elliot, The Debates in the Several State Conventions on the\nAdoption of the Federal Constitution 455 (2d ed. 1854) (hereinafter\nElliot). Statements by delegates to the state ratification\nconventions indicate that this understanding was widely held by the\nfounding generation.E.g.,id., at 245\u2013246\n(statement of George Nicholas) (\u201cSuppose [the Necessary and Proper\nClause] had been inserted, at the end of every power, that they\nshould have power to make laws to carry that power into execution;\nwould that have increased their powers? If, therefore, it could not\nhave increased their powers, if placed at the end of each power, it\ncannot increase them at the end of all\u201d).[Footnote 2]Roughly 30 years after the Constitution\u2019s\nratification,McCullochfirmly established this\nunderstanding in our constitutional jurisprudence. 4 Wheat., at\n421, 423. Since then, our precedents uniformly have maintained that\nthe Necessary and Proper Clause is not an independent fount of\ncongressional authority, but rather \u201cacaveatthat\nCongress possesses all the means necessary to carry out the\nspecifically granted \u2018foregoing\u2019 powers of \u00a78 \u2018and all other Powers\nvested by this Constitution.\u2019\u00a0\u201dKinsellav.United States ex rel. Singleton,361 U. S. 234, 247\n(1960);Carterv.Carter Coal Co.,298 U. S. 238, 291\n(1936); seeAldenv.Maine,527 U. S. 706, 739\n(1999);Martinv.Hunter\u2019s Lessee, 1 Wheat. 304,\n326 (1816); see alsoGonzalesv.Raich,545 U. S. 1, 39 (2005) (Scalia, J.,\nconcurring in judgment) (stating that, although the Clause\n\u201cempowers Congress to enact laws . . . that are not within its\nauthority to enact in isolation,\u201d those laws must be \u201cin\neffectuation of [Congress\u2019] enumerated powers\u201d (citingMcCulloch,supra, at 421\u2013422)).IISection 4248 establishes a\nfederal civil-commitment regime for certain persons in the custody\nof the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP).[Footnote 3] If the Attorney General demonstrates to a\nfederal court by clear and convincing evidence that a person\nsubject to the statute is \u201csexually dangerous,\u201d[Footnote 4] a court may order the person\ncommitted until he is no longer a risk \u201cto others,\u201d even if that\ndoes not occur until after his federal criminal sentence has\nexpired or the statute of limitations on the federal charge against\nhim has run. \u00a7\u00a74248(a), (d)\u2013(e).No enumerated power in\nArticle\u00a0I, \u00a78, expressly delegates to Congress the power to\nenact a civil-commitment regime for sexually dangerous persons, nor\ndoes any other provision in the Constitution vest Congress or the\nother branches of the Federal Government with such a power.\nAccordingly, \u00a74248 can be a valid exercise of congressional\nauthority only if it is \u201cnecessary and proper for carrying into\nExecution\u201d one or more of those federal powers actually enumerated\nin the Constitution.Section 4248 does not fall within any of those\npowers. The Government identifies no specific enumerated power or\npowers as a constitutional predicate for \u00a74248, and none are\nreadily discernable. Indeed, not even the Commerce Clause\u2014the\nenumerated power this Court has interpreted most expansively, see,e.g.,NLRBv.Jones & Laughlin Steel\nCorp.,301 U. S.\n1, 37 (1937)\u2014can justify federal civil detention of sex\noffenders. Under the Court\u2019s precedents, Congress may not regulate\nnoneconomic activity (such as sexual violence) based solely on the\neffect such activity may have, in individual cases or in the\naggregate, on interstate commerce. Morrison, 529 U. S., at\n617\u2013618;United Statesv.Lopez,514 U. S. 549, 563\u2013567\n(1995). That limitation forecloses any claim that \u00a74248 carries\ninto execution Congress\u2019 Commerce Clause power, and the Government\nhas never argued otherwise, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 21\u201322.[Footnote 5]This Court, moreover, consistently has\nrecognized that the power to care for the mentally ill and, where\nnecessary, the power \u201cto protect the community from the dangerous\ntendencies of some\u201d mentally ill persons, are among the numerous\npowers that remain with the States.Addingtonv.Texas,441\nU. S. 418, 426 (1979). As a consequence, we have held that\nStates may \u201ctake measures to restrict the freedom of the\ndangerously mentally ill\u201d\u2014including those who are sexually\ndangerous\u2014provided that such commitments satisfy due process and\nother constitutional requirements.Kansasv.Hendricks,521 U. S. 346, 363\n(1997).Section 4248 closely resembles the involuntary\ncivil-commitment laws that States have enacted under theirparens patriaeand general police powers. Indeed, it is\nclear, on the face of the Act and in the Government\u2019s arguments\nurging its constitutionality, that \u00a74248 is aimed at protecting\nsociety from acts of sexual violence, not toward \u201ccarrying into\nExecution\u201d any enumerated power or powers of the Federal\nGovernment. See Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006,\n120 Stat. 587 (entitled \u201c[a]n Act [t]o protect children from sexual\nexploitation and violent crime\u201d), \u00a7102,id., at 590\n(statement of purpose declaring that the Act was promulgated \u201cto\nprotect the public from sex offenders\u201d); Brief for United States\n38\u201339 (asserting the Federal Government\u2019s power to \u201cprotect the\npublic from harmthat might result upon these prisoners\u2019\nrelease, even when that harm might arise from conduct that isotherwise beyond the general regulatory powers of the federal\ngovernment\u201d (emphasis added)).To be sure, protecting society from violent\nsexual offenders is certainly an important end. Sexual abuse is a\ndespicable act with untold consequences for the victim personally\nand society generally. See,e.g.,Kennedyv.Louisiana, 554 U. S. ___, ___, n.\u00a02, (2008) (Alito,\nJ., dissenting) (slip op., at 9, n.\u00a02, 22\u201323). But the\nConstitution does not vest in Congress the authority to protect\nsociety from every bad act that might befall it.[Footnote 6]New Yorkv.United\nStates,505 U. S. 144, 157 (1992) (\u201c\u00a0\u2018The\nquestion is not what power the Federal Government ought to have but\nwhat powers in fact have been given by the people\u2019\u00a0\u201d (quotingUnited Statesv.Butler,297 U. S. 1, 63\n(1936)).In my view, this should decide the question.\nSection 4248 runs afoul of our settled understanding of Congress\u2019\npower under the Necessary and Proper Clause. Congress may act under\nthat Clause only when its legislation \u201ccarr[ies] into Execution\u201d\none of the Federal Government\u2019s enumerated powers. Art.\u00a0I, \u00a78,\ncl. 18. Section 4248 does not executeanyenumerated\npower. Section 4248 is therefore unconstitutional.IIIThe Court perfunctorily\ngenuflects toMcCulloch\u2019s framework for assessing\nCongress\u2019 Necessary and Proper Clause authority, and to the\nprinciple of dual sovereignty it helps to maintain, then promptly\nabandons both in favor of a novel five-factor test supporting its\nconclusion that \u00a74248 is a \u201c\u00a0\u2018necessary and proper\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nadjunct to a jumble ofunenumerated\u201cauthorit[ies].\u201dAnte, at 22. The Court\u2019s newly minted test cannot be\nreconciled with the Clause\u2019s plain text or with two centuries of\nour precedents interpreting it. It also raises more questions than\nit answers. Must each of the five considerations exist before the\nCourt sustains future federal legislation as proper exercises of\nCongress\u2019 Necessary and Proper Clause authority? What if the facts\nof a given case support a finding of only four considerations? Or\nthree? And if three or four will suffice,whichthree or\nfour are imperative? At a minimum, this shift from the two-stepMcCullochframework to this five-consideration approach\nwarrants an explanation as to whyMcCullochis no longer\ngood enough and which of the five considerations will bear the most\nweight in future cases, assuming some number less than five\nsuffices. (Or, if not, why all five are required.) The Court\nprovides no answers to these questions.AI begin with the first and last\n\u201cconsiderations\u201d in the Court\u2019s inquiry.Ante, at 5. The\nCourt concludes that \u00a74248 is a valid exercise of Congress\u2019\nNecessary and Proper Clause authority because that authority is\n\u201cbroad,\u201dibid., and because \u201cthe links between \u00a74248 and\nan enumerated Article I power are not too attenuated,\u201dante, at 18. In so doing, the Court first inverts, then\nmisapplies,McCulloch\u2019s straightforward two-part test.1aFirst, the Court describes\nCongress\u2019 lawmaking power under the Necessary and Proper Clause as\n\u201cbroad,\u201d relying on precedents that have upheld federal laws under\nthe Clause after finding a \u201c\u00a0\u2018rationa[l]\u2019\u00a0\u201d fit between\nthe law and an enumerated power.Ante, at 6 (quotingSabriv.United States,541 U. S. 600, 605 (2004)). It is true\nthat this Court\u2019s precedents allow Congress a certain degree of\nlatitude in selecting the means for \u201ccarrying into Execution\u201d an\nend that is \u201clegitimate.\u201d[Footnote\n7] See,e.g.,Jinksv.Richland\nCounty,538 U.\nS. 456, 462\u2013463 (2003) (citingMcCulloch, 4 Wheat., at\n417, 421). But in citing these cases, the Court puts the cart\nbefore the horse: The fit between means and ends matters only if\nthe end is in fact legitimate\u2014i.e., only if it is one of\nthe Federal Government\u2019s enumerated powers.By starting its inquiry with the\ndegree of deference owed to Congress in selecting means to further\na legitimate end, the Court bypassesMcCulloch\u2019s first\nstep and fails carefully to examine whether the end served by \u00a74248\nis actually one of those powers. See Part III\u2013A\u20132,infra.bSecond, instead of asking the\nsimple question of what enumerated power \u00a74248 \u201ccarr[ies] into\nExecution\u201d atMcCulloch\u2019s first step, the Court surveys\nother laws Congress has enacted and concludes that, because \u00a74248\nis related to those laws, the \u201clinks\u201d between \u00a74248 and an\nenumerated power are not \u201ctoo attenuated\u201d; hence, \u00a74248 is a valid\nexercise of Congress\u2019 Necessary and Proper Clause authority.Ante, at 18. This unnecessarily confuses the analysis and,\nif followed to its logical extreme, would result in an unwarranted\nexpansion of federal power.The Court observes that Congress\nhas the undisputed authority to \u201ccriminalize conduct\u201d that\ninterferes with enumerated powers; to \u201cimprison individuals who\nengage in that conduct\u201d; to \u201cenact laws governing [those] prisons\u201d;\nand to serve as a \u201ccustodian of its prisoners.\u201dAnte, at\n9, 14. From this, the Court assumes that \u00a74248 must also be a valid\nexercise of congressional power because it is \u201c\u00a0\u2018reasonably\nadapted\u2019\u00a0\u201d tothoseexercises of Congress\u2019\nincidental\u2014and thus unenumerated\u2014authorities. Seeante, at\n15 (concluding that \u201c\u00a74248 is \u2018reasonably adapted\u2019 to Congress\u2019\npower to act as a responsible federal custodian\u201d (citation\nomitted));ante, at 22 (concluding that \u201cthe statute is a\n\u2018necessary and proper\u2019 means of exercising the federal authority\nthat permits Congress to create federal criminal laws, to punish\ntheir violation, to imprison violators, to provide appropriately\nfor those imprisoned, and to maintain the security of those who are\nnot imprisoned but who may be affected by the federal imprisonment\nof others\u201d). But that is not the question. The Necessary and Proper\nClause does not provide Congress with authority to enact any law\nsimply because it furthersother lawsCongress has enacted\nin the exercise of its incidental authority; the Clause plainly\nrequires a showing that every federal statute \u201ccarr[ies] into\nExecution\u201d one or more of the Federal Government\u2019senumeratedpowers.[Footnote 8]Federal laws that criminalize conduct that\ninterferes with enumerated powers, establish prisons for those who\nengage in that conduct, and set rules for the care and treatment of\nprisoners awaiting trial or serving a criminal sentence satisfy\nthis test because each helps to \u201ccarr[y] into Execution\u201d the\nenumerated powers that justify a criminal defendant\u2019s arrest or\nconviction. For example, Congress\u2019 enumerated power \u201c[t]o establish\nPost Offices and post Roads,\u201d Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 7, would lack force\nor practical effect if Congress lacked the authority to enact\ncriminal laws \u201cto punish those who steal letters from the post\noffice, or rob the mail.\u201dMcCulloch,supra, at\n417. Similarly, that enumerated power would be compromised if there\nwere no prisons to hold persons who violate those laws, or if those\nprisons were so poorly managed that prisoners could escape or\ndemand their release on the grounds that the conditions of their\nconfinement violate their constitutional rights, at least as we\nhave defined them. See,e.g.,Estellev.Gamble,429\nU. S. 97(1976). Civil detention under \u00a74248, on the other\nhand, lacks any such connection to an enumerated power.2After focusing on the\nrelationship between \u00a74248 and several of Congress\u2019 implied powers,\nthe Court finally concludes that the civil detention of a \u201csexually\ndangerous person\u201d under \u00a74248 carries into execution the enumerated\npower that justified that person\u2019s arrest or conviction in the\nfirst place. In other words, the Court analogizes \u00a74248 to federal\nlaws that authorize prison officials to care for federal inmates\nwhile they serve sentences or await trial. But while those laws\nhelp to \u201ccarr[y] into Execution\u201d the enumerated power that\njustifies the imposition of criminal sanctions on the inmate, \u00a74248\ndoes not bear that essential characteristic for three reasons.First, the statute\u2019s definition\nof a \u201csexually dangerous person\u201d contains no element relating to\nthe subject\u2019s crime. See \u00a7\u00a74247(a)(5)\u2013(6). It thus does not require\na federal court to find any connection between the reasons\nsupporting civil commitment and the enumerated power with which\nthat person\u2019s criminal conduct interfered. As a consequence, \u00a74248\nallows a court to civilly commit an individual without finding that\nhe was ever charged with or convicted of a federal crime involving\nsexual violence. \u00a7\u00a74248(a), (d). That possibility is not merely\nhypothetical: The Government concedes that nearly 20% of\nindividuals against whom \u00a74248 proceedings have been brought fit\nthis description.[Footnote 9]\nTr. of Oral Arg. 23\u201325.Second, \u00a74248 permits the term of federal\ncivil commitment to continue beyond the date on which a convicted\nprisoner\u2019s sentence expires or the date on which the statute of\nlimitations on an untried defendant\u2019s crime has run. The statute\ntherefore authorizes federal custody over a person at a time when\nthe Government would lack jurisdiction to detain him for violating\na criminal law that executes an enumerated power.The statute this Court upheld inGreenwoodv.United States,350 U. S. 366(1956),\nprovides a useful contrast. That statute authorized the Federal\nGovernment to exercise civil custody over a federal defendant\ndeclared mentally unfit to stand trial only \u201c\u00a0\u2018until the\naccused shall be mentally competent to stand trial or until the\npending charges against him are disposed of according to\nlaw.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId., at 368, n.\u00a02 (quoting 18 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a74246 (1952 ed.)). Thus, that statute\u2019s \u201cend\u201d reasonably\ncould be interpreted as preserving the Government\u2019s power to\nenforce a criminal law against the accused. Section 4248 (2006\ned.), however, authorizes federal detention of a person evenafterthe Government loses the authority to prosecute him\nfor a federal crime.Third, the definition of a \u201csexually\ndangerous person\u201d relevant to \u00a74248 does not require the court to\nfind that the person is likely to violate a law executing an\nenumerated power in the future. Although the Federal Government has\nno express power to regulate sexual violence generally, Congress\nhas passed a number of laws proscribing such conduct in special\ncircumstances. All of these statutes contain jurisdictional\nelements that require a connection to one of Congress\u2019 enumerated\npowers\u2014such as interstate commerce,e.g., \u00a72252(a)(2)\u2014or\nthat limit the statute\u2019s coverage to jurisdictions in which\nCongress has plenary authority,e.g., \u00a72243(a). Section\n4248, by contrast, authorizes civil commitment upon a showing that\nthe person is \u201csexually dangerous,\u201d and presents a risk \u201cto\nothers,\u201d \u00a74247(a)(5). It requires no evidence that this sexually\ndangerous condition will manifest itself in a way that interferes\nwith a federal law that executes an enumerated power or in a\ngeographic location over which Congress has plenary\nauthority.[Footnote 10]In sum, the enumerated powers that justify a\ncriminal defendant\u2019s arrest or conviction cannot justify his\nsubsequent civil detention under \u00a74248.BThe remaining \u201cconsiderations\u201d in\nthe Court\u2019s five-part inquiry do not alter this conclusion.1First, in a final attempt to\nanalogize \u00a74248 to laws that authorize the Federal Government to\nprovide care and treatment to prisoners while they await trial or\nserve a criminal sentence, the Court cites the Second Restatement\nof Torts for the proposition that the Federal Government has a\n\u201ccustodial interest\u201d in its prisoners,ante, at 22, and,\nthus, a broad \u201cconstitutional power to act in order to protect\nnearby (and other) communities\u201d from the dangers they may\npose,[Footnote 11]ante, at 14. That citation is puzzling because federal\nauthority derives from the Constitution, not the common law. In any\nevent, nothing in the Restatement suggests that a common-law\ncustodian has the powers that Congress seeks here. While the\nRestatement provides that a custodian has a duty to take reasonable\nsteps to ensure that a person in his care does not cause \u201cbodily\nharm to others,\u201d 2 Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7319, p. 129\n(1963\u20131964), that duty terminates once the legal basis for custody\nexpires:\u201cThere is no duty so to control the conduct of a\nthird person as to prevent him from causing physical harm to\nanother unless\u201c(a) a special relation exists between the\nactor and the third person which imposes a duty upon the actor to\ncontrol the third person\u2019s conduct, or\u201c(b) a special relation exists between the\nactor and the other which gives to the other a right to\nprotection.\u201dId., \u00a7315, at 122.Once the Federal Government\u2019s criminal jurisdiction\nover a prisoner ends, so does any \u201cspecial relation[ship]\u201d between\nthe Government and the former prisoner.[Footnote 12]For this reason, I cannot agree with Justice\nAlito that \u00a74248 is a necessary and proper incident of Congress\u2019\npower \u201cto protect the public from dangers created by the federal\ncriminal justice and prison systems.\u201dAnte, at 3\n(concurring in judgment). A federal criminal defendant\u2019s \u201csexually\ndangerous\u201d propensities are not \u201ccreated by\u201d the fact of his\nincarceration or his relationship with the federal prison system.\nThe fact that the Federal Government has the authority to imprison\na person for the purpose of punishing him for a federal\ncrime\u2014sex-related or otherwise\u2014does not provide the Government with\nthe additional power to exercise indefinite civil control over that\nperson.[Footnote 13]2Second, the Court describes \u00a74248\nas a \u201cmodest\u201d expansion on a statutory framework with a long\nhistorical pedigree.Ante, at 9. Yet even if the antiquity\nof a practice could serve as a substitute for its\nconstitutionality\u2014and the Court admits that it cannot,ibid.\u2014the Court overstates the relevant history.Congress\u2019 first foray into this\ngeneral area occurred in 1855, when it established St. Elizabeth\u2019s\nHospital to provide treatment to \u201cinsane\u201d persons in the military\nand the District of Columbia. Act of Mar. 3, 1855, 10 Stat. 682.\nBut Congress was acting pursuant toenumeratedpowers when\nit took this step. See Art.\u00a0I, \u00a78, cl. 17 (granting Congress\nplenary authority over the District of Columbia); Art. I, \u00a78, cl.\n14 (authorizing Congress to \u201cmake Rules for the Government and\nRegulation of the land and naval Forces\u201d). This enactment therefore\nprovides no support for Congress\u2019 claimed power to detain sexually\ndangerous persons without an otherwise valid basis for\njurisdiction.Later, Congress provided for the federal civil\ncommitment of \u201cinsane\u201d persons charged with or convicted of a\nfederal crime. Act of Feb. 7, 1857, \u00a7\u00a75\u20136, 11 Stat. 158; see 17 Op.\nAtty. Gen. 211, 212\u2013213 (1881); Act of June 23, 1874, ch. 465, 18\nStat. 251; Act of Aug. 7, 1882, 22 Stat. 330. As the Court\nexplains, however, these statutes did not authorize federal custody\nbeyond the completion of the \u201cterm\u201d of federal \u201cimprisonment,\u201d\n\u00a7\u00a72\u20133, 18 Stat. 252; see 35 Op. Atty. Gen. 366, 368 (1927); 30 Op.\nAtty. Gen. 569, 570\u2013571 (1916); Act of May 13, 1930, ch. 254, \u00a76,\n46 Stat. 271, and thus shed no light on the question presented\nhere.In 1949, Congress enacted a more comprehensive\nregime, authorizing the civil commitment of mentally ill persons in\nBOP custody. See 18 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a74246, 4247 (1952 ed.). This\nCourt addressed that regime inGreenwood, but never\nendorsed the proposition that the Federal Government could rely on\nthat statute to detain a person in the absence of a pending\ncriminal charge or ongoing criminal sentence.[Footnote 14]As already noted,Greenwoodupheld\nthe commitment of a federal defendant declared unfit to stand trial\non the narrow ground that the Government\u2019s criminal jurisdiction\nover the defendant\u2014its \u201cpower to prosecute for federal\noffenses\u2014[wa]s not exhausted,\u201d but rather \u201cpersist[ed]\u201d in the form\nof a \u201cpending indictment.\u201d 350 U. S., at 375; seesupra,\nat 16. The Court was careful to state that\u201c[t]hiscommitment, and therefore the legislation authorizing commitmentinthecontextofthiscase, involve[d] an assertion of authority\u201d within\n\u201ccongressional power under the Necessary and Proper Clause.\u201dGreenwood, 350 U. S., at 375 (emphasis added). But it\npainstakingly limited its holding to \u201cthe narrow constitutional\nissue raised by th[at] order of commitment.\u201dIbid.The historical record thus supports the\nFederal Government\u2019s authority to detain a mentally ill person\nagainst whom it has the authority to enforce a criminal law. But it\nprovides no justification whatsoever for reading the Necessary and\nProper Clause to grant Congress the power to authorize the\ndetention of persons without a basis for federal criminal\njurisdiction.3Finally, the Court offers two\narguments regarding \u00a74248\u2019s impact on the relationship between the\nFederal Government and the States. First, the Court and both\nconcurrences suggest that Congress must have had the power to enact\n\u00a74248 because a long period of federal incarceration might\n\u201cseve[r]\u201d a sexually dangerous prisoner\u2019s \u201cclaim to \u2018legal\nresidence\u2019\u00a0\u201d in any particular State,ante, at 15\n(opinion of the Court), thus leaving the prisoner without any \u201chome\nState to take charge\u201d of him upon release,ante, at 5\n(Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment); seeante, at 1\n(Alito, J., concurring in judgment) (noting that many federal\nprisoners, \u201cas a result of lengthy federal incarceration, no longer\nha[ve] any substantial ties to any State\u201d). I disagree with the\npremise of that argument. As an initial matter, States plainly have\nthe constitutional authority to \u201ctake charge\u201d of a federal prisoner\nreleased within their jurisdiction. See Amdt. 10 (stating that\npowers not delegated to the Federal Government are \u201creserved\u201d to\nthe States, and to the people). In addition, the assumption that a\nState knowingly would fail to exercise that authority is, in my\nview, implausible. The Government stated at oral argument that its\n\u201cdefault position\u201d is to release a federal prisoner to the State in\nwhich he was convicted, Tr. of Oral Arg. 15; see also 28 CFR\n\u00a72.33(b) (2009), and neither the Court nor the concurrences argue\nthat a State has the power to refuse such a person domicile within\nits borders. Thus, they appear to assume that, in the absence of 18\nU. S.\u00a0C. \u00a74248, a State would take no action when informed by\nthe BOP that a sexually dangerous federal prisoner was about to be\nreleased within its jurisdiction. In light of the plethora of state\nlaws enacted in recent decades to protect communities from sex\noffenders,[Footnote 15] the\nlikelihood of such an occurrence seems quite remote. But even in\nthe event a State made such a decision, the Constitution assigns\nthe responsibility for that decision, and its consequences, to the\nstate government alone.Next, the Court submits that\n\u00a74248 does not upset the balance of federalism or invade the\nStates\u2019 reserved powers because it \u201crequires accommodation of state\ninterests\u201d by instructing the Attorney General to release a\ncommitted person to the State in which he was domiciled or tried if\nthat State wishes to \u201c\u00a0\u2018assume . . . responsibility\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nfor him.Ante, at 17 (quoting \u00a74248(d)).This\nright of first refusal is mere window dressing. Tr. of Oral Arg. 5\n(\u201cIt is not the usual course that the State does take\nresponsibility\u201d). More importantly, it is an altogether hollow\nassurance that \u00a74248 preserves the principle of dual\nsovereignty\u2014the \u201cletter and spirit\u201d of the Constitution\u2014as the\nNecessary and Proper Clause requires.[Footnote 16]McCulloch, 4 Wheat., at 421;Printzv.United States,521 U. S. 898, 923\u2013924\n(1997). For once it is determined that Congress has the authority\nto provide for the civil detention of sexually dangerous persons,\nCongress \u201cis acting within the powers granted it under the\nConstitution,\u201d and \u201cmay impose its will on the States.\u201dGregory, 501 U. S., at 460; see Art.\u00a0VI, cl.\u00a02.\nSection 4248\u2019s right of first refusal is thus not a matter of\nconstitutional necessity, but an act of legislative grace.Nevertheless, 29 States appear asamiciand argue that \u00a74248 is constitutional. They tell us\nthat they do not object to Congress retaining custody of \u201csexually\ndangerous persons\u201d after their criminal sentences expire because\nthe cost of detaining such persons is \u201cexpensive\u201d\u2014approximately\n$64,000 per year\u2014and these States would rather the Federal\nGovernment bear this expense. Brief for Kansas et\u00a0al. 2;ibid.(\u201c[S]ex offender civil commitment programs are\nexpensive to operate\u201d);id., at 4 (\u201cthese programs are\nexpensive\u201d);id., at 8 (\u201c[T]here are very practical\nreasons to prefer a system that includes a federal sex offender\ncivil commitment program .\u00a0. . . One such reason is the\nsignificant cost\u201d).Congress\u2019 power, however, is fixed by the\nConstitution; it does not expand merely to suit the States\u2019 policy\npreferences, or to allow State officials to avoid difficult choices\nregarding the allocation of state funds. By assigning the Federal\nGovernment power over \u201ccertain enumerated objects only,\u201d the\nConstitution \u201cleaves to the several States a residuary and\ninviolable sovereignty over all other objects.\u201d The Federalist No.\n39, at 285 (J.

It is the States\u2019 duty to act as\nthe \u201cimmediate and visible guardian\u201d of those liberties because\nfederal powers extend no further than those enumerated in the\nConstitution.

S.\n621, 636 (1992) (\u201cFederalism serves to assign political\nresponsibility, not to obscure it\u201d).Absent congressional action that is in\naccordance with, or necessary and proper to, an enumerated power,\nthe duty to protect citizens from violent crime, including acts of\nsexual violence, belongs solely to the States.Morrison,\n529 U. S., at 618 (\u201c[W]e can think of no better example of the\npolice power, which the Founders denied the National Government and\nreposed in the States, than the suppression of violent crime\u201d); seeCohensv.Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 426 (1821)\n(Marshall, C.\u00a0J.)

Regrettably, today\u2019s\nopinion breathes new life into that Clause, and\u2014the Court\u2019s\nprotestations to the contrary notwithstanding, seeante,\nat 18\u2014comes perilously close to transforming the Necessary and\nProper Clause into a basis for the federal police power that \u201cwealwayshave rejected,\u201dLopez, 514 U.

S.\u00a0C. \u00a74248(a).Footnote 4The Act defines a \u201csexually dangerous person\u201d\nas one \u201cwho has engaged or attempted to engage in sexually violent\nconduct or child molestation,\u201d and \u201cwho is sexually dangerous to\nothers.\u201d \u00a74247(a)(5). It further defines \u201csexually dangerous to\nothers\u201d to mean a person who \u201csuffers from a serious mental\nillness\u201d such that he would \u201chave serious difficulty in refraining\nfrom sexually violent conduct or child molestation if released.\u201d\n\u00a74247(a)(6).Footnote 5For the reasons explained in Part III\u2013A\u20132,infra, the enumerated power that justifies a particular\ndefendant\u2019s criminal arrest or conviction cannot justify his\nsubsequent civil detention under \u00a74248.Footnote 6The absence of a constitutional delegation of\ngeneral police power to Congress does not leave citizens vulnerable\nto the harms Congress seeks to regulate in \u00a74248 because, as recent\nlegislation indicates, the States have the capacity to address the\nthreat that sexual offenders pose. See n. 15,infra.Footnote 7Justice Kennedy concludes that the Necessary\nand Proper Clause requires something beyond rational-basis scrutiny\nwhen assessing the fit between an enumerated power and the means\nCongress selects to execute it.Ante, at 2\u20134 (opinion\nconcurring in judgment). Other arguments regarding the degree of\nfit between means and end have been lodged elsewhere. See,e.g.,Gonzalesv.Raich,545 U. S. 1, 61 (2005) (Thomas, J.,\ndissenting) (arguing that, for a law to be within the Necessary and\nProper Clause, it must bear an \u201c\u00a0\u2018obvious, simple, and direct\nrelation\u2019\u00a0\u201d to an exercise of Congress\u2019 enumerated powers and\nmust not subvert basic principles of federalism and dual\nsovereignty). But I find that debate beside the point here, because\nit concerns the analysis employed atMcCulloch\u2019s second\nstep, seeMcCullochv.Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316\n(1819), while the Court\u2019s decision today errs by skipping the\nfirst.Footnote 8McCullochmakes this point clear. As\nthe Court notes,ante, at 18\u201319,McCullochstates, in discussing a hypothetical, that from Congress\u2019\nenumerated power to establish post offices and post roads \u201chas been\ninferred the power and duty of carrying the mail,\u201d and, \u201cfrom this\nimplied power, has again been inferred the right to punish those\nwho steal letters from the post office, or rob the mail.\u201d 4 Wheat.,\nat 417. Contrary to the Court\u2019s interpretation, this dictum does\nnot suggest that the relationship between Congress\u2019 implied power\nto punish postal crimes and its implied power to carry the mail is\nalone sufficient to satisfy review under the Necessary and Proper\nClause. Instead,McCullochdirectly links the\nconstitutionality of the former to Congress\u2019 enumerated power\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018to establish post offices and post roads.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIbid.(explaining that \u201cthe right to . . . punish those\nwho rob [the mail] is not indispensably necessary to the\nestablishment of a post office and post road,\u201d but is \u201cessential to\nthe beneficial exercise of th[at] power\u201d). More importantly,McCulloch\u2019s holding, as well as the holdings of this\nCourt\u2019s subsequent decisions, make plain that congressional action\nis valid under the Necessary and Proper Clause only if it carries\ninto execution one or more enumerated powers.Id., at 422\n(upholding Congress\u2019 incorporation of a bank because it was a\n\u201cmeans . . . to be employed only for the purpose of carrying into\nexecutionthe given powers\u201d (emphasis added)); seeSabriv.UnitedStates,541 U. S. 600, 605 (2004) (\u201cCongress\nhas authorityunder the Spending Clauseto appropriate\nfederal moneys to promote the general welfare, and it hascorresponding authorityunder the Necessary and Proper\nClause to see to it that taxpayer dollars appropriated under that\npower are in fact spent for the general welfare\u201d (emphasis added;\ncitations omitted));Stewartv.Kahn, 11 Wall.\n493, 506\u2013507 (1871) (\u201cThe power to pass [the Act in question] is\nnecessarily implied from thepowers to make war and suppress\ninsurrections\u201d (emphasis added) (referring to Art.\u00a0I, \u00a78,\ncls. 11 and 15)).Footnote 9The statute does require the court to find\nthat the subject \u201chas engaged or attempted to engage in sexually\nviolent conduct or child molestation,\u201d \u00a74247(a)(5), but that\nfactual predicate can be established by astateconviction, or by clear and convincing evidence that the person\ncommitted a sex crime for which he was never charged.Footnote 10The Constitution grants Congress plenary\nauthority over certain jurisdictions where no other sovereign\nexists, including the District of Columbia, Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 17, and\nfederal territories, Art. IV, \u00a73, cl.\u00a02. In addition, Congress\nhas \u201cbroad general powers to legislate in respect to Indian\ntribes,\u201dUnited Statesv.Lara,541 U. S. 193, 200\n(2004) (citing Art.\u00a0I, \u00a78, cl. 3; Art.\u00a0II, \u00a72,\ncl.\u00a02), including certain special responsibilities over\n\u201cIndian country,\u201d 18 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71151. Although the Necessary\nand Proper Clause did not authorize Congress to enact \u00a74248, I do\nnot rule out the possibility that Congress could provide for the\ncivil commitment of individuals who enter federal custody as a\nresult of acts committed in these jurisdictions. See,e.g.,UnitedStatesv.Cohen,\n733 F.\u00a02d 128 (CADC 1984) (en banc) (upholding civil\ncommitment of a defendant under a District of Columbia statute\nauthorizing the institutionalization of persons acquitted by reason\nof insanity). Although two of the respondents in this case were\neither charged with or convicted of criminal acts committed in such\njurisdictions, seeante, at 3; 507 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d 522,\n527, and n.\u00a02 (EDNC 2007), that question is not presented here\nbecause \u00a74248 does not make that fact essential to an individual\u2019s\nplacement in civil detention.Footnote 11The Court also citesYoungbergv.Romeo,457\nU. S. 307(1982), but that case lends even less support than\nthe Restatement. InYoungberg, an inmate at a state\nhospital argued that hospital workers violated his constitutional\nrights when they applied restraints to keep him in his bed at the\nhospital infirmary.Id., at 310\u2013311. In assessing that\nclaim, this Court noted that the hospital had a responsibility to\n\u201cprotectitsresidents\u201d from the danger of\nviolence.Id., at 320 (emphasis added). The Court never\nsuggested that this responsibility extended to \u201cnearby (and other)\ncommunities.\u201dAnte, at 14. Moreover, the hospital was astateinstitution. Nothing inYoungbergsuggests\nthat the Federal Government can detain a person beyond the date on\nwhich its criminal jurisdiction expires for fear that he may later\npose a threat to the surrounding community.Footnote 12Federal law permits a sentencing court to\norder that a defendant be placed on a term of \u201csupervised release\u201d\nafter his term of imprisonment is complete. 18 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7\u00a73583, 3624(e). Contrary to the Government\u2019s suggestion, federal\nauthority to exercise control over individuals serving terms of\n\u201csupervised release\u201d does not derive from the Government\u2019s\n\u201crelationship\u201d with the prisoner, see Brief for United States 38,\nbut from the original criminal sentence itself. Supervised release\nthus serves to execute the enumerated power that justifies the\ndefendant\u2019s statute of conviction, just like any other form of\npunishment imposed at sentencing.Footnote 13The fact that Congress has the authority to\n\u201cprovide for the apprehension of escaped federal prisoners,\u201d seeante, at 3 (Alito, J., concurring in judgment), does not\nchange this conclusion. That authority derives from Congress\u2019 power\nto vindicate the enumerated power with which the escaped\ndefendant\u2019s crime of conviction interfered, not a freestanding\npolice power.Footnote 14In addition, at least some courts questioned\nthe Federal Government\u2019s power to detain a person in such\ncircumstances. SeeDixonv.Steele, 104\nF.\u00a0Supp. 904, 908 (WD Mo. 1952) (holding that the Federal\nGovernment lacked authority to detain an individual declared\nmentally unfit to stand trial once it was determined that he was\nunlikely to recover in time to be prosecuted);Higginsv.United States, 205 F.\u00a02d 650, 653 (CA9 1953)\n(avoiding this constitutional question by interpreting the statute\nto permit federal civil detention only for a period reasonably\nrelated to a criminal prosecution);Wellsv.Attorney\nGeneralof United States, 201 F.\u00a02d 556, 560\n(CA10 1953) (same).Footnote 15As we have noted before, all 50 States have\ndeveloped \u201csome variation\u201d of a system \u201cfor mandatory registration\nof sex offenders and corresponding community notification.\u201dSmithv.Doe,538 U. S. 84, 89\u201390\n(2003). In addition, several States have taken further steps; some\nimpose residency restrictions on sex offenders, see,e.g.,Kennedyv.Louisiana, 554 U. S. ___ , ___,\nn.\u00a05 (2008) (Alito, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 11,\nn.\u00a05) (collecting statutes), and, most relevant here, 22\nStates have enacted involuntary civil-commitment laws substantially\nsimilar to \u00a74248, see Ariz.

S. 144, 159 (1992)). Section\n4248 is unconstitutional because it does not \u201ccarr[y] into\nExecution\u201d an enumerated power. Therefore, it necessarily intrudes\nupon the powers our Constitution reserves to the States and to the\npeople.",
