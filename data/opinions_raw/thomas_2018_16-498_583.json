While his suit was pending in the District Court, Congress\nenacted the Gun Lake Trust Land Reaffirmation Act (Gun Lake Act or\nAct), Pub. L. 113\u2013179, 128Stat. 1913, which provides that suits\nrelating to the land \u201cshall not be filed or maintained in a Federal\ncourt and shall be promptly dismissed.\u201d Patchak contends that, in\nenacting this statute, Congress impermissibly infringed the\njudicial power that Article III of the Constitution vests\nexclusively in the Judicial Branch. Because we disagree, we affirm\nthe judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the District\nof Columbia Circuit.IThe Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band of\nPottawatomi Indians (Band) resides in southwestern Michigan, near\nthe township of Wayland. The Band traces its relationship with the\nUnited States back hundreds of years, pointing to treaties it\nnegotiated with the Federal Government as early as 1795. But the\nSecretary of the Interior did not formally recognize the Band until\n1999. See 63 Fed. Reg. 56936 (1998); 65 Fed. Reg. 13298 (2000).After obtaining formal recognition, the Band\nidentified a 147-acre parcel of land in Wayland, known as the\nBradley Property, where it wanted to build a casino. The Band asked\nthe Secretary to invoke the Indian Reorganization Act, \u00a75, 48Stat.\n985, 25 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a75108, and take the Bradley Property\ninto trust.[1] In 2005, the\nSecretary agreed and posted a notice informing the public that the\nBradley Property would be taken into trust for the Band. See 70\nFed. Reg. 25596 (2005).The Michigan Gambling Opposition (MichGO) sued,\nalleging that the Secretary\u2019s decision violated federal\nenvironmental and gaming laws. After several years of litigation,\nthe D.\u00a0C. Circuit affirmed the dismissal of MichGo\u2019s claims,\nand this Court denied certiorari.Michigan Gambling\nOppositionv.Kempthorne, 525 F.\u00a03d 23 (2008),\ncert. denied, 555 U.\u00a0S. 1137 (2009) . In January 2009, the\nSecretary formally took the Bradley Property into trust. And in\nFebruary 2011, the Band opened its casino.Before the Secretary formally took the land into\ntrust, a nearby landowner, David Patchak, filed another lawsuit\nchallenging the Secretary\u2019s decision. Invoking the Administrative\nProcedure Act, 5 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a7702, 706(2), Patchak alleged\nthat the Secretary lacked statutory authority to take the Bradley\nProperty into trust for the Band. The Indian Reorganization Act\ndoes not allow the Secretary to take land into trust for tribes\nthat were not under federal jurisdiction when the statute was\nenacted in 1934. SeeCarcieriv.Salazar, 555\nU.\u00a0S. 379 \u2013383 (2009). The Band was not federally recognized\nuntil 1999, which Patchak argued was more than 65 years too late.\nBased on this alleged statutory violation, Patchak sought to\nreverse the Secretary\u2019s decision to take the Bradley Property into\ntrust.The Secretary raised preliminary objections to\nPatchak\u2019s suit, contending that it was barred by sovereign immunity\nand that Patchak lacked prudential standing to bring it. The\nDistrict Court granted the Secretary\u2019s motion to dismiss, but the\nD.\u00a0C. Circuit reversed.Patchakv.Salazar, 646\nF.\u00a0Supp. 2d 72 (DC 2009), rev\u2019d, 632 F.\u00a03d 702 (2011).\nThis Court granted certiorari and affirmed the D.\u00a0C. Circuit.Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi Indiansv.Patchak, 567 U.\u00a0S. 209 (2012) (Patchak I).\nThis Court\u2019s decision inPatchak\u00a0Iheld that Congress\nhad waived the Secretary\u2019s sovereign immunity from suits like\nPatchak\u2019s.Id.,at 215\u2013224. It also held that Patchak had\nprudential standing because his suit arguably fell within the \u201czone\nof interests\u201d protected by the Indian Reorganization Act.Id.,at 224\u2013228. Because Patchak had standing and the\nSecretary lacked immunity, this Court concluded that \u201cPatchak\u2019s\nsuit may proceed,\u201did.,at 212, and remanded for further\nproceedings,id.,at 228.In September 2014, while Patchak\u2019s suit was back\nin the District Court, Congress enacted the Gun Lake Act, 128Stat.\n1913. Section 2(a) of the Act states that the Bradley Property \u201cis\nreaffirmed as trust land, and the actions of the Secretary of the\nInterior in taking that land into trust are ratified and\nconfirmed.\u201d Section 2(b) then provides the following:\u201cNo Claims.\u2014Notwithstanding any other\nprovision of law, an action (including an action pending in a\nFederal court as of the date of enactment of this Act) relating to\nthe land described in subsection (a) shall not be filed or\nmaintained in a Federal court and shall be promptly dismissed.\u201dBased on \u00a72(b), the District Court entered\nsummary judgment against Patchak and dismissed his suit for lack of\njurisdiction. 109 F.\u00a0Supp.\u00a03d 152 (DC 2015).The D.\u00a0C. Circuit affirmed.Patchakv.Jewell, 828 F.\u00a03d 995 (2016). It held that \u201c[t]he\nlanguage of the Gun Lake Act makes plain that Congress has stripped\nfederal courts of subject matter jurisdiction\u201d over suits, like\nPatchak\u2019s, that relate to the Bradley Property.Id.,at\n1001. The D.\u00a0C. Circuit rejected Patchak\u2019s argument that \u00a72(b)\nviolates Article III of the Constitution.Id.,at 1001\u20131003.\nArticle III prohibits Congress from \u201cdirect[ing] the result of\npending litigation,\u201d the D.\u00a0C. Circuit reasoned, but it does\nnot prohibit Congress from \u201c\u00a0\u2018supply[ing] new law.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId.,at 1002 (quotingRobertsonv.Seattle Audubon\nSoc., 503 U.\u00a0S. 429, 439 (1992) ).

Because it does not,\nwe now affirm.IIAThe Constitution creates three branches of\nGovernment and vests each branch with a different type of power.\nSee Art.\u00a0I, \u00a71; Art.\u00a0II, \u00a71, cl.\u00a01; Art.\u00a0III,\n\u00a71. \u201cTo the legislative department has been committed the duty of\nmaking laws; to the executive the duty of executing them; and to\nthe judiciary the duty of interpreting and applying them in cases\nproperly brought before the courts.\u201dMassachusettsv.Mellon, 262 U.\u00a0S. 447, 488 (1923) ; see alsoWaymanv.Southard, 10 Wheat. 1, 46 (1825) (Marshall,\nC.\u00a0J.) (\u201c[T]he legislature makes, the executive executes, and\nthe judiciary construes the law\u201d). By vesting each branch with an\nexclusive form of power, the Framers kept those powers separate.\nSeeINSv.Chadha, 462 U.\u00a0S. 919, 946 (1983) .\nEach branch \u201cexercise[s] .\u00a0.\u00a0. the powers appropriate to\nits own department,\u201d and no branch can \u201cencroach upon the powers\nconfided to the others.\u201dKilbournv.Thompson, 103\nU.\u00a0S. 168, 191 (1881) .

SeePlautv.Spendthrift Farm, Inc., 514 U.\u00a0S. 211,\n218 (1995) . One way that Congress can cross the line from\nlegislative power to judicial power is by \u201cusurp[ing] a court\u2019s\npower to interpret and apply the law to the [circumstances] before\nit.\u201dBank Markaziv.Peterson, 578 U.\u00a0S. ___,\n___ (2016) (slip op., at 12).

Seeid.,at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 15\u201319).To distinguish between permissible exercises of\nthe legislative power and impermissible infringements of the\njudicial power, this Court\u2019s precedents establish the following\nrule: Congress violates Article III when it \u201ccompel[s]\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. findings or results under old law.\u201dSeattle\nAudubon,supra, at 438. But Congress does not violate\nArticle III when it \u201cchanges the law.\u201dPlaut,supra,\nat 218.BSection 2(b) changes the law. Specifically, it\nstrips federal courts of jurisdiction over actions \u201crelating to\u201d\nthe Bradley Property. Before the Gun Lake Act, federal courts had\njurisdiction to hear these actions. See 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a71331. Now they do not. This kind of legal change is well within\nCongress\u2019 authority and does not violate Article III.1Section 2(b) strips federal jurisdiction over\nsuits relating to the Bradley Property. The statute uses\njurisdictional language. It states that an \u201caction\u201d relating to the\nBradley Property \u201cshall not be filed or maintained in a Federal\ncourt.\u201d It imposes jurisdictional consequences: Actions relating to\nthe Bradley Property \u201cshall be promptly dismissed.\u201d SeeEx parte\nMcCardle, 7 Wall. 506, 514 (1869) (\u201c[W]hen [jurisdiction]\nceases to exist, the only function remaining to the court is that\nof announcing the fact and dismissing the cause\u201d). Section 2(b) has\nno exceptions. Cf.Reed Elsevier, Inc.v.Muchnick,\n559 U.\u00a0S. 154, 165 (2010) . And it applies \u201c[n]otwithstanding\nany other provision of law,\u201d including the general grant of\nfederal-question jurisdiction, 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71331.\nAlthough \u00a72(b) does not use the word \u201cjurisdiction,\u201d this Court\ndoes not require jurisdictional statutes to \u201cincant magic words.\u201dSebeliusv.Auburn Regional Medical Center, 568\nU.\u00a0S. 145, 153 (2013) . Indeed, \u00a72(b) uses language similar to\nother statutes that this Court has deemed jurisdictional. See,e.g.,Gonzalezv.Thaler, 565 U.\u00a0S. 134,\n142 (2012) (\u201c\u00a0\u2018an appeal may not be taken\u2019\u00a0\u201d (quoting 28\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72253(c)(1)));Keene Corp.v.United\nStates, 508 U.\u00a0S. 200 \u2013209 (1993) (\u201c\u00a0\u2018[n]o person\nshall file or prosecute\u2019\u00a0\u201d (quoting 36Stat. 1138));Weinbergerv.Salfi, 422 U.\u00a0S. 749, 756 (1975)\n(\u201c\u00a0\u2018[n]o action .\u00a0.\u00a0. shall be brought under [ 28\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71331]\u2019\u00a0\u201d (quoting 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7405(h))).Our conclusion that \u00a72(b) is jurisdictional is\nbolstered by the fact that it cannot plausibly be read as anything\nelse. Section 2(b) is not one of the nonjurisdictional rules that\nthis Court\u2019s precedents have identified as \u201cimportant and\nmandatory\u201d but not governing \u201ca court\u2019s adjudicatory capacity.\u201dHendersonv.Shinseki, 562 U.\u00a0S. 428, 435 (2011)\n. Section 2(b) does not identify an \u201celement of [the] plaintiff \u2019s\nclaim for relief \u201d or otherwise define its \u201csubstantive adequacy.\u201dArbaughv.Y & H Corp., 546 U.\u00a0S. 500, 516,\n504 (2006) . Nor is it a \u201cclaim-processing rule,\u201d like a filing\ndeadline or an exhaustion requirement, that requires the parties to\n\u201ctake certain procedural steps at certain specified times.\u201dHenderson,supra, at 435.Instead, \u00a72(b)\ncompletely prohibits actions relating to the Bradley Property.\nBecause \u00a72(b) addresses \u201ca court\u2019s competence to adjudicate a\nparticular category of cases,\u201dWachovia Bank, N.\u00a0A.v.Schmidt, 546 U.\u00a0S. 303, 316 (2006) , it is best read as\na jurisdiction-stripping statute.2Statutes that strip jurisdiction \u201cchang[e] the\nlaw\u201d for the purpose of Article III,Plaut,supra, at\n218, just as much as other exercises of Congress\u2019 legislative\nauthority. Article I permits Congress \u201c[t]o constitute Tribunals\ninferior to the supreme Court,\u201d \u00a78, and Article III vests the\njudicial power \u201cin one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts\nas the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish,\u201d \u00a71.\nThese provisions reflect the so-called Madison- ian Compromise,\nwhich resolved the Framers\u2019 disagreement about creating lower\nfederal courts by leaving that decision to Congress. SeePrintzv.United States, 521 U.\u00a0S. 898, 907\n(1997) ; 1 Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, p. 125 (M.\nFarrand ed. 1911). Congress\u2019 greater power to create lower federal\ncourts includes its lesser power to \u201climit the jurisdiction of\nthose Courts.\u201dUnited Statesv.Hudson, 7 Cranch 32,\n33 (1812); accord,Lockertyv.Phillips, 319\nU.\u00a0S. 182, 187 (1943) . So long as Congress does not violate\nother constitutional provisions, its \u201ccontrol over the jurisdiction\nof the federal courts\u201d is \u201cplenary.\u201dTrainmenv.Toledo,\nP. & W. R. Co., 321 U.\u00a0S. 50 \u201364 (1944); see alsoBowlesv.Russell, 551 U.\u00a0S. 205, 212 (2007)\n(\u201cWithin constitutional bounds, Congress decides what cases the\nfederal courts have jurisdiction to consider\u201d). Thus, when Congress\nstrips federal courts of jurisdic- tion, it exercises a valid\nlegislative power no less than when it lays taxes, coins money,\ndeclares war, or invokes any other power that the Constitution\ngrants it.Indeed, this Court has held that Congress\ngenerally does not violate Article III when it strips federal\njurisdiction over a class of cases.[3] Shortly after the Civil War, for example, Congress\nrepealed this Court\u2019s appellate jurisdiction over certain habeas\ncorpus cases. See Act of Mar. 27, 1868, ch.\u00a034, \u00a72, 15Stat.\n44; see also U.\u00a0S. Const., Art.\u00a0III, \u00a72 (permitting\nCongress to make \u201cExceptions\u201d to this Court\u2019s appellate\njurisdiction). William McCardle, a military prisoner whose appeal\nwas pending at the time, argued that the repealing statute was \u201can\nexercise by the Congress of judicial power.\u201d 7 Wall., at 510. This\nCourt disagreed. Jurisdiction-stripping statutes, the Court\nexplained, do not involve \u201cthe exercise of judicial power\u201d or\n\u201clegislative interference with courts in the exercising of\ncontinuing jurisdiction.\u201dId.,at 514. Because jurisdiction\nis the \u201cpower to declare the law\u201d in the first place, \u201cjudicial\nduty is not less fitly performed by declining ungranted\njurisdiction than in exercising firmly that which the Constitution\nand the laws confer.\u201dId.,at 514\u2013515.[4]This Court has reaffirmed these principles on\nmany occasions. Congress generally does not infringe the judicial\npower when it strips jurisdiction because, with limited exceptions,\na congressional grant of jurisdiction is aprerequisiteto\nthe exercise of judicial power. SeeSteel Co.v.Citizens\nfor Better Environment, 523 U.\u00a0S. 83 \u201395 (1998) (\u201cThe\nrequirement that jurisdiction be established as a threshold matter\n\u2018spring[s] from the nature and limits of the judicial power of the\nUnited States\u2019\u00a0\u201d (quotingMansfield, C. & L. M. R.\nCo.v.Swan, 111 U.\u00a0S. 379, 382 (1884) ));Caryv.Curtis, 3 How. 236, 245 (1845) (\u201c[T]he\njudicial power of the United States .\u00a0.\u00a0. is (except in\nenumerated instances, applicable exclusively to this court)\ndependent .\u00a0.\u00a0. entirely upon the action of Congress\u201d);Hudson,supra, at 33 (similar). \u201cTo deny this\nposition\u201d would undermine the separation of powers by \u201celevat[ing]\nthe judicial over the legislative branch.\u201dCary,supra, at 245. Congress\u2019 power over federal jurisdiction is\n\u201can essential ingredient of separation and equilibration of powers,\nrestraining the courts from acting at certain times, and even\nrestraining them from acting permanently regarding certain\nsubjects.\u201dSteel Co.,supra, at 101.In sum, \u00a72(b) strips jurisdiction over suits\nrelating to the Bradley Property. It is a valid exercise of\nCongress\u2019 legislative power. And because it changes the law, it\ndoes not infringe the judicial power. The constitutionality of\njurisdiction-stripping statutes like this one is well\nestablished.IIIPatchak does not dispute Congress\u2019 power to\nwithdraw jurisdiction from the federal courts. He instead raises\ntwo arguments why \u00a72(b) violates Article III, even if it strips\njurisdiction. First, relying onUnited Statesv.Klein, 13 Wall. 128 (1872), Patchak argues that \u00a72(b) flatly\ndirects federal courts to dismiss lawsuits without allowing them to\ninterpret or apply any new law. Second, relying onPlaut,\n514 U.\u00a0S. 211 , Patchak argues that \u00a72(b) attempts to\ninterfere with this Court\u2019s decision inPatchak\nI\u2014specifically, its conclusion that his suit \u201cmay proceed,\u201d 567\nU.\u00a0S., at 212. We reject both arguments.ASection 2(b) does not flatly direct federal\ncourts to dismiss lawsuits under old law. It creates new law for\nsuits relating to the Bradley Property, and the District Court\ninterpreted and applied that new law in Patchak\u2019s suit. Section\n2(b)\u2019s \u201crelating to\u201d standard effectively guaranteed that Patchak\u2019s\nsuit would be dismissed. But \u201ca statute does not impinge on\njudicial power when it directs courts to apply a new legal standard\nto undisputed facts.\u201dBank Markazi, 578 U.\u00a0S., at ___\n(slip op., at 17). \u201c[I]t is not any the less a case or controversy\nupon which a court possessing the federal judicial power may\nrightly give judgment\u201d when the arguments before the court are\n\u201cuncontested or incontestable.\u201dPopev.United\nStates, 323 U.\u00a0S. 1, 11 (1944) .Patchak argues that the last four words of\n\u00a72(b)\u2014\u201cshall be promptly dismissed\u201d\u2014direct courts to reach a\nparticular outcome. But a statute does not violate Article III\nmerely because it uses mandatory language. SeeSeattle\nAudubon, 503 U.\u00a0S., at 439. Instead of directing outcomes,\nthe mandatory language in \u00a72(b) \u201csimply imposes the consequences\u201d\nof a court\u2019s determination that it lacks jurisdiction because a\nsuit relates to the Bradley Property.Millerv.French, 530 U.\u00a0S. 327, 349 (2000) ; seeMcCardle, 7 Wall., at 514.[5]Patchak compares \u00a72(b) to the statute this Court\nheld unconstitutional inKlein. In that case, the\nadministrator of the estate of V.\u00a0F. Wilson, a former\nConfederate soldier, sued to recover the value of some cotton that\nthe Government had seized during the war. 13 Wall., at 132. The\nrelevant statute required claimants to prove their loyalty in order\nto reclaim their property. Ch. 120, \u00a73, 12Stat. 820. Wilson had\nreceived a pardon before he died, 13 Wall., at 132, and this Court\nhad held that pardons conclusively prove loyalty under the statute,\nseeUnited Statesv.Padelford, 9 Wall. 531, 543\n(1870). But after Wilson\u2019s administrator secured a judgment in his\nfavor, 13 Wall., at 132, Congress passed a statute making pardons\nproof of disloyalty and declaring that, if a claimant had accepted\none, \u201cthe jurisdiction of the court in the case shall cease, and\nthe court shall forthwith dismiss the suit of such claimant.\u201d Act\nof July 12, 1870, 16Stat. 235. If the court had already entered\njudgment in favor of a pardoned claimant and the Government had\nappealed, the statute instructed this Court to dismiss the whole\nsuit for lack of jurisdiction. Seeibid.Kleinheld\nthat this statute infringed the executive power by attempting to\n\u201cchange the effect of .\u00a0.\u00a0. a pardon.\u201dId.,at\n148.Kleinalso held that the statute infringed the judicial\npower, seeid.,at 147, although its reasons for this latter\nholding were not entirely clear.This Court has since explained that \u201cthe statute\ninKleininfringed the judicial power, not because it left\ntoo little for courts to do, but because it attempted to direct the\nresult without altering the legal standards governing the effect of\na pardon\u2014standards Congress was powerless to prescribe.\u201dBank\nMarkazi,supra, at ___ (slip op., at 15). Congress had\nno authority to declare that pardons are not evidence of loyalty,\nso it could not achieve the same result by stripping jurisdiction\nwhenever claimants cited pardons as evidence of loyalty. SeeKlein, 13 Wall., at 147\u2013148. Nor could Congress confer\njurisdiction to a federal court but then strip jurisdiction from\nthat same court once the court concluded that a pardoned claimant\nshould prevail under the statute. Seeid.,at 146\u2013147.Patchak\u2019s attempts to compare \u00a72(b) to the\nstatute inKleinare unpersuasive. Section 2(b) does not\nattempt to exercise a power that the Constitution vests in another\nbranch. And unlike the selective jurisdiction-stripping statute inKlein, \u00a72(b) strips jurisdiction over every suit relating to\nthe Bradley Property. Indeed,Kleinitself explained that\nstatutes that do \u201cnothing more\u201d than strip jurisdiction over \u201ca\nparticular class of cases\u201d are constitutional.Id., at 145.\nThat is precisely what \u00a72(b) does.BSection 2(b) does not unconstitutionally\ninterfere with this Court\u2019s decision inPatchak\u00a0I.\nArticle III, this Court explained inPlaut, prohibits\nCongress from \u201cretroactively commanding the federal courts to\nreopen final judgments.\u201d 514 U.\u00a0S., at 219. ButPatchak\u00a0Idid not finally conclude Patchak\u2019s case. SeeBradleyv.School Bd. of Richmond, 416 U.\u00a0S. 696\n, n.\u00a014 (1974). When this Court said that his suit \u201cmay\nproceed,\u201d 567 U.\u00a0S., at 212, it meant that the Secretary\u2019s\npreliminary defenses lacked merit and that Patchak could return to\nthe District Court for further proceedings. It did not mean that\nCongress was powerless to change the law that governs his case. As\nthis Court emphasized inPlaut, Article III does not\nprohibit Congress from enacting new laws that apply to pending\ncivil cases. See 514 U.\u00a0S., at 226\u2013227. When a new law clearly\ngoverns pending cases, Article III does not prevent courts from\napplying it because \u201ceach court, at every level, must \u2018decide\naccording to existing laws.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIbid.(quotingUnited\nStatesv.Schooner Peggy, 1 Cranch 103, 109 (1801)).\nThis principle applies equally to statutes that strip jurisdiction.\nSeeLandgrafv.USI Film Products, 511 U.\u00a0S.\n244, 274 (1994) ;Klinev.Burke Constr. Co., 260\nU.\u00a0S. 226, 234 (1922) ;Hallowellv.Commons,\n239 U.\u00a0S. 506, 509 (1916) . Because \u00a72(b) expressly references\n\u201cpending\u201d cases, it applies to Patchak\u2019s suit. And because\nPatchak\u2019s suit is not final, applying \u00a72(b) here does not offend\nArticle III.[6]Of course, we recognize that the Gun Lake Act\nwas a response to this Court\u2019s decision inPatchak\u00a0I.\nThe text of the Act, after all, cites both the administrative\ndecision and the property at issue in that case. See \u00a7\u00a72(a)\u2013(b).\nAnd we understand why Patchak would view the Gun Lake Act as\nunfair. By all accounts, the Band exercised its political influence\nto persuade Congress to enact a narrow jurisdiction-stripping\nprovision that effectively ends all lawsuits threatening its\ncasino, including Patchak\u2019s.But the question in this case is \u201c[n]ot\nfavoritism, nor even corruption, butpower.\u201dPlaut,supra, at 228; see alsoMcCardle, 7 Wall., at 514\n(\u201cWe are not at liberty to inquire into the motives of the\nlegislature. We can only examine into its power under the\nConstitution\u201d). Under this Court\u2019s precedents, Congress has the\npower to \u201capply newly enacted, outcome-altering legislation in\npending civil cases,\u201dBank Markazi, 578 U.\u00a0S., at ___\n(slip op., at 16), even when the legislation \u201cgovern[s] one or a\nvery small number of specific subjects,\u201did., at ___ (slip\nop., at 21). For example, this Court has upheld narrow statutes\nthat identified specific cases by caption and docket number in\ntheir text. Seeid.,at ___ (slip op., at 19);Seattle\nAudubon, 503 U.\u00a0S., at 440. And this Court has approvingly\ncited a D.\u00a0C. Circuit decision, which upheld a statute that\nretroactively stripped jurisdiction over suits challenging \u201ca\nsingle memorial.\u201dBank Markazi,supra,at ___ (slip\nop., at 22) (citingNational Coalition To Save Our Mallv.Norton, 269 F.\u00a03d 1092 (2001)). If these targeted\nstatutes did not cross the line from legislative to judicial power,\nthen \u00a72(b) does not either.IVThe dissent offers a different theory for why\n\u00a72(b) violates Article III. A statute impermissibly exercises the\njudicial power, the dissent contends, when it \u201ctargets\u201d a\nparticular suit and \u201cmanipulates\u201d jurisdiction to direct the\noutcome, \u201cpractical[ly] operat[es]\u201d to affect only one suit, and\nannounces a legal standard that does not \u201cimply some measure of\ngenerality\u201d or \u201cpreserv[e] .\u00a0.\u00a0. an adjudicative role for\nthe courts.\u201dPost, at 8, 11.We doubt that the constitutional line separating\nthe legislative and judicial powers turns on factors such as a\ncourt\u2019s doubts about Congress\u2019 unexpressed motives, the number of\n\u201ccases [that] were pending when the provision was enacted,\u201d or the\ntime left on the statute of limitations.Post, at 8. But\neven if it did, we disagree with the dissent\u2019s characterization of\n\u00a72(b). Nothing on the face of \u00a72(b) is limited to Patchak\u2019s case,\nor even to his challenge under the Indian Reorganization Act.\nInstead, the text extends to all suits \u201crelating to\u201d the Bradley\nProperty. Thus, \u00a72(b) survives even under the dissent\u2019s theory: It\n\u201cprospectively govern[s] an open-ended class of disputes,\u201dpost,at 6, and its \u201crelating to\u201d standard \u201cpreserv[es]\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. an adjudicative role for the courts,\u201dpost,\nat 11. While \u00a72(b)\u2019s \u201crelating to\u201d standard is not difficult to\ninterpret or apply, this Court\u2019s precedentsencourageCongress to draft jurisdictional statutes in this manner. SeeHertz Corp.v.Friend, 559 U.\u00a0S. 77, 94 (2010)\n(\u201c[A]dministrative simplic- ity is a major virtue in a\njurisdictional statute.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. [C]ourts benefit from\nstraightforward rules under which they can readily assure\nthemselves of their power to hear a case\u201d).[7]*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*We conclude that \u00a72(b) of the Gun Lake Act\ndoes not violate Article III of the Constitution. The judgment of\nthe Court of Appeals is, therefore, affirmed.It is so ordered.Notes1Federal law allows Indian\ntribes to operate casinos on \u201cIndian lands,\u201d 25 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a72710, which includes lands \u201cheld in trust by the United States for\nthe benefit of any Indian tribe,\u201d \u00a72703(4)(B).2Patchak does not\nchallenge the constitutionality of \u00a72(a) of the Gun Lake Act. See\nReply Brief 7; Tr. of Oral Arg. 5. We thus limit our analysis to\n\u00a72(b).3Jurisdiction-stripping\nstatutes can violate other provisions of the Constitution. And,\nunder our precedents, jurisdiction-stripping statutes can violate\nArticle III if they \u201cattemp[t] to direct the result\u201d by effectively\naltering legal standards that Congress is \u201cpowerless to prescribe.\u201dBank Markaziv.Peterson, 578 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___\n(2016) (slip op., at 15) (citingUnited Statesv.Klein, 13 Wall. 128, 146\u2013147 (1872)).4The dissent appears to\ndisagree withMcCardle, questions the motives of the\nunanimous Court that decided it, asserts that it is \u201cinconsistent\u201d\nwithKlein, and distinguishes it on the ground that the\nstatute there \u201cdid not foreclose all avenues of judicial review.\u201dPost,at 12\u201313 (opinion of Roberts, C.\u00a0J.). But the\ncore holding ofMcCardle\u2014that Congress does not exercise the\njudicial power when it strips jurisdiction over a class of\ncases\u2014has never been questioned, has been repeatedly reaffirmed,\nand was reaffirmed inKleinitself. See 13 Wall., at 145\n(\u201c[T]here could be no doubt\u201d that Congress can \u201cden[y] the right of\nappeal in a particular class of cases\u201d). And if there is any\ninconsistency between the two, this Court has said that it isKlein\u2014notMcCardle\u2014that \u201ccannot [be] take[n]\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. \u2018at face value.\u2019\u00a0\u201dBank Markazi, 578\nU.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 15) (quoting R. Fallon, J.\nManning, D. Meltzer, & D. Shapiro, Hart and Wechsler\u2019s The\nFederal Courts and the Federal System 324 (7th ed. 2015)).\nMoreover, it is true thatMcCardleemphasized that the\nstatute there did not withdraw \u201cthe whole appellate power of the\ncourt,in cases of habeas corpus.\u201d 7 Wall., at 515 (emphasis\nadded). ButMcCardle\u2019s reservation, this Court later\nexplained, was responding to a potential problem under the\nSuspension Clause, not a potential problem under Article III. SeeEx parte Yerger, 8 Wall. 85, 102\u2013103 (1869) (\u201cWe agree that\n[jurisdiction] is given subject to exception and regulation by\nCongress; but it is too plain for argument that the denial to this\ncourt of appellate jurisdiction in this class of cases must greatly\nweaken the efficacy of the writ\u201d);id.,at 96 (\u201cIt would\nhave been .\u00a0.\u00a0. a remarkable anomaly if this court\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. had been denied, under a constitution which\nabsolutely prohibits suspension of the writ, except under\nextraordinary exigencies, that power in cases of alleged unlawful\nrestraint\u201d).5To prove that it does not\nchange the law, Patchak repeatedly asserts that \u00a72(b) does not\namend any \u201cgenerally applicable\u201d statute. Brief for Petitioner 11;\nReply Brief 1, 4, 9. But this Court rejected that same argument inSeattle Audubon. Congress can change a law \u201cdirectly,\u201d or it\ncan change a law indirectly by passing \u201can entirely separate\nstatute.\u201d 503 U.\u00a0S., at 439\u2013440. Either way, it changes the\nlaw. The same is true for jurisdictional statutes. SeeInsurance\nCo.v.Ritchie, 5 Wall. 541 (1867).6Retroactive legislation\ncan violate other provisions of the Constitution, such as theEx\nPost FactoClause and the Bills of Attainder Clause. SeeBank Markazi, 578 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 16). But\nPatchak\u2019s Article III claim is the only challenge to \u00a72(b) before\nus.7We also doubt that the\nstatute this Court upheld inBank Markaziwould survive\nunder the dissent\u2019s theory. The dissent notes that the statute\nthere affected \u201c16 different actions,\u201d while the statute here\naffects \u201ca single pending case.\u201dPost, at 8. But if the\nproblem is Congress \u201cpick[ing] winners and losers in pending\nlitigation,\u201dpost, at 14, then it seems backwards to\nconclude that Congress is onstrongerconstitutional footing\nwhen it picks winners and losers inmorepending\ncases.",
