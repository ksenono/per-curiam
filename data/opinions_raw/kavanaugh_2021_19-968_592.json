PRECZEWSKI, et\u00a0al.on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the eleventh circuit[March 8, 2021]Justice Kavanaugh, concurring.I agree with the Court that, as a matter of\nhistory and precedent, a plaintiff\u2019s request for nominal damages\ncan satisfy the redressability requirement for Article III standing\nand can keep an otherwise moot case alive. I write separately\nsimply to note that I agree with The Chief Justice and the\nSolicitor General that a defendant should be able to accept the\nentry of a judgment for nominal damages against it and thereby end\nthe litigation without a resolution of the merits.Post, at\n11 (Roberts, C.\u00a0J., dissenting); Brief for United States asAmicus Curiae29\u201330.",
