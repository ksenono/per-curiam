I\nwrite separately to reiterate my view that we should explicitly\nabandon our \u201cpurposes and objectives\u201d pre-emption\njurisprudence.The founding generation treated conflicts\nbetween federal and state laws as implied repeals.PLIVA,\nInc.v.Mensing,564 U.S.\n604, 622 (2011) (plurality opinion). Then, as now, courts\ndisfavored repeals by implication. See,e.g., Warderv.Arell, 2 Va. 282, 299 (1796) (opinion of PresidentJudge); 2 T. Cunningham, A New and Complete Law-\nDictionary (2d ed. 1771) (defining \u201cStatute\u201d); 4 M. Bacon, A New\nAbridgment of the Law 638 (3d ed. 1768). To overcome this disfavor,\nlegislatures includednon obstanteclauses in statutes. See\nNelson, Preemption, 86 Va. L.\u00a0Rev. 225, 237\u2013240, and\nnn.\u00a042\u201344 (2000) (collecting examples). Courts understoodnon obstanteprovisions to mean that, \u201c[r]ather than\nstraining the new statute in order to harmonize it with prior law,\n[they] were supposed to give the new statute its natural meaning\nand to let the chips fall where they may.\u201dId., at 242.The Founders included anon obstanteprovision in the Supremacy Clause. It directs that \u201cthe Judges in\nevery State shall be bound\u201d by the \u201cConstitution, and the Laws of\nthe United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; and all\nTreaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the\nUnited States, .\u00a0.\u00a0. any Thing in the Constitution or\nLaws of any state to the Contrary notwithstanding.\u201d Art.\u00a0VI,\ncl.\u00a02. If we interpret the Supremacy Clause as the founding\ngeneration did, our task is straightforward. We must use the\naccepted methods of interpretation to ascertain whether the\nordinary meaning of federal and state law \u201cdirectly conflict.\u201dWyethv.Levine,555 U.S.\n555, 590 (2009) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment).\n\u201c[F]ederal law pre-empts state law only if the two are in logical\ncontradiction.\u201dMerck Sharp & Dohme Corp.v.Albrecht, 587 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2019) (Thomas, J.,\nconcurring) (slip op., at 2); see also Nelson,supra,at\n236\u2013237.The doctrine of \u201cpurposes and objectives\u201d\npre-emption impermissibly rests on judicial guesswork about \u201cbroad\nfederal policy objectives, legislative history, or generalized\nnotions of congressional purposes that are not contained within the\ntext of federal law.\u201dWyeth,supra, at 587 (opinion\nof Thomas, J.); see alsoArizonav.United States,567 U.S.\n387, 440 (2012) (Thomas, J., concurring in part and dissenting\nin part). I therefore cannot apply \u201cpurposes and objectives\u201d\npre-emption doctrine, as it is contrary to the Supremacy\nClause.[1]*In these cases, the Court correctly\ndistinguishes our \u201cpurposes and objectives\u201d precedents and does not\nengage in a \u201c\u00a0\u2018freewheeling judicial inquiry into whether a\nstate statute is in tension with federal objectives.\u2019\u00a0\u201dWyeth,supra,at 588 (opinion of Thomas, J.) (quotingBatesv.Dow Agrosciences LLC,544 U.S.\n431, 459 (2005) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment in part and\ndissenting in part)). It also acknowledges that \u201c[t]he Supremacy\nClause gives priority to \u2018the laws of the United States,\u2019 not the\ncriminal law enforcement priorities or preferences of federal\nofficers.\u201dAnte,at 19. Because the Court rejects\nrespondents\u2019 \u201cpurposes and objectives\u201d argument without atextual\nspeculation about legislative intentions, I join its opinion in\nfull.Notes1*I am also skeptical of field\npre-emption, \u201cat least as applied in the absence of a congressional\ncommand that a particular field be pre-empted.\u201dCamps\nNewfound/Owatonna, Inc.v.Town of Harrison,520 U.S.\n564, 617 (1997) (Thomas, J., dissenting). For today, however,\nit suffices to say that the Court correctly applies our field\npre-emption precedents and that \u201cnothing in the text of the\nrelevant federal statutes indicates that Congress intended\u201d to\npre-empt a pertinent field.Arizona, 567 U.\u00a0S., at 439\n(opinion of Thomas, J.).",
