HOLDER, Jr., ATTORNEY GENERALon writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the fifth circuit[March 3, 2009]Justice Thomas, dissenting.The \u201cpersecutor bar\u201d in the\nImmigration and Nationality Act (INA) denies asylum and the\nwithholding of removal to any alien who has \u201cordered, incited,\nassisted, or otherwise participated in the persecution of any\nperson on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a\nparticular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7\u00a71101(a)(42), 1158(b)(2)(A), 1231(b)(3)(B)(i). The Board of\nImmigration Appeals (BIA), principally relying on this Court\u2019s\ndecision inFedorenkov.United States,449 U. S. 490(1981), held that the\nstatute does not require that the persecution be voluntarily\ninflicted. The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed.According to the Court,Fedorenko,\nwhich construed the similar text of a persecution bar in the\nDisplaced Persons Act of 1948 (DPA), is largely irrelevant to the\nquestion presented here. Seeante, at 6\u20138, 9\u201310; see alsoante, at 2 (Scalia, J., concurring). The majority further\nholds that the INA is ambiguous as to \u201cwhether coercion or duress\nis relevant in determining if an alien assisted or otherwise\nparticipated in persecution\u201d and that the agency, therefore, should\ninterpret the statute in the first instance to determine whether it\nreasonably can be read to include a voluntariness requirement.Ante, at 5, 10\u201312; see alsoante, at 1 (Scalia,\nJ., concurring). I disagree with both of these conclusions. Because\nthe INA unambiguously precludes any inquiry into whether the\npersecutor acted voluntarily,i.e., free from coercion or\nduress, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals. I\nrespectfully dissent.IPetitioner Daniel Girmai Negusie\ntestified to the Immigration Judge (IJ) that he was forced to work\nas an armed guard for four years at an Eritrean prison camp where\nprisoners were persecuted because of their religious beliefs.\nAccording to petitioner, part of his job was \u201cto firmly control the\nprisoners, to punish the prisoners, too, by exposing them\u201d to the\nextreme heat of the African sun. App. 58. The guards \u201cwould \u2026 hold\n[a] stick [with] their hand\u201d and follow prisoners who were being\nforced to \u201croll on the ground in the sun.\u201dId., at 23.\nBecause \u201cit was extremely hot,\u201d prisoners would quickly \u201cget tired\nand [feel] shortness of breath and stop\u201d rolling.Id.,at\n24. They were then beaten. Prisoners typically could not survive\nthis punishment for more than two hours. Indeed, at least one\nprisoner died from sun exposure while petitioner stood guard. Seeante, at 3 (majority opinion).Petitioner testified that, as a\nguard, he prevented the prisoners from showering and forbade them\nfrom leaving their rooms for fresh air. This form of punishment was\nparticularly severe because the prisons were \u201cbuilt from stone and\nbricks\u201d with \u201cno cooling system, no ventilation, no windows,\u201d and\nintolerable heat. App. 20, 30. Petitioner also prevented prisoner\nescapes, for which the punishment was forced sun exposure. And,\nalthough petitioner never used \u201celectricity to torture\u201d prisoners,\nhe was aware that his supervisor did.Id.,at 61\u201362.But petitioner, who had converted to\nProtestantism when he was confined as a prisoner at the camp, also\ntestified that he did not want to persecute any of the prisoners\nbecause his new religion taught him \u201cto be merciful.\u201dId.,at 34. Thus, at times he disobeyed his orders. On one occasion, he\ngave water to a prisoner who was dying from sun exposure. On\nanother occasion, he let female prisoners take showers after they\nhad been denied that privilege \u201cfor a long time.\u201dId.,at\n37. Petitioner also occasionally allowed some of the prisoners to\n\u201cgo outside during the night and during the evenings and \u2026 refresh\nthemselves in the fresh air.\u201dId.,at 37\u201338.After four years as a prison guard, petitioner\ndeserted his post, swam to a shipping container, and hid inside.\nSeeante, at 3 (majority opinion). The container arrived\nin the United States with petitioner inside on December 20, 2004.\nPetitioner applied for asylum and the withholding of removal under\nthe INA, 8 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71101et seq.He also applied for\nprotection under the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel,\nInhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT), under which it\nis \u201cthe policy of the United States not to expel, extradite, or\notherwise effect the involuntary return of any person to a country\nin which there are substantial grounds for believing the person\nwould be in danger of being subjected to torture.\u201d Foreign Affairs\nReform and Restructuring Act of 1998, \u00a72242(a), 112 Stat. 2681\u2013822,\nnote following 8 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71231, p. 263 (United States Policy\nwith Respect to Involuntary Return of Persons in Danger of\nSubjection to Torture (hereinafter CAT Policy)). See also CAT, Dec.\n10, 1984, S. Treaty Doc. No. 100\u201320, 1465\nU.\u00a0N.\u00a0T.\u00a0S. 85. Petitioner feared that, if returned\nto Eritrea, he would \u201cbe executed\u201d because he had converted to\nProtestantism and deserted his military post. App. 65, 68.The INA provides the Executive with the\ndiscretion to grant asylum to aliens that are \u201cunable or unwilling\u201d\nto return to their home country \u201cbecause of persecution or a\nwell-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion,\nnationality, membership in a particular social group, or political\nopinion.\u201d 8 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a71101(a)(42)(A), 1158(b)(1). The INA\nalso requires the Executive to withhold removal of aliens to a\ncountry in which there is a \u201cclear probability\u201d that their \u201clife or\nfreedom would be threatened\u201d because of their \u201crace, religion,\nnationality, membership in a particular social group, or political\nopinion.\u201d \u00a71231(b)(3)(A). However, the INA prohibits the Executive\nfrom granting asylum or withholding removal if an alien \u201cordered,\nincited, assisted, or otherwise participated in the persecution\u201d of\nany person on account of \u201crace, religion, nationality, membership\nin a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d\n\u00a71158(b)(2)(A)(i) (asylum); \u00a71231(b)(3)(B) (withholding of\nremoval). Nonetheless, in light of the CAT\u2019s requirement that \u201c[n]o\nState Party shall \u2026 return \u2026 a person to another State where there\nare substantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger of\nbeing subjected to torture,\u201d Art. 3, S. Treaty Doc. No. 100\u201320, at\n20, regulations implementing that convention provide \u201cdeferral of\nremoval\u201d to aliens subject to the INA persecutor bar who would more\nlikely than not be tortured if removed to their home\ncountry.[Footnote 1] 8 CFR\n\u00a7\u00a71208.16(c)(4), (d)(2), 1208.17(a) (2008); see also CAT Policy\n(b), at 263 (requiring federal agencies to \u201cprescribe regulations\nto implement the obligations of the United States under Article 3\nof the [CAT], subject to any reservations, understandings,\ndeclarations, and provisos contained in the United States Senate\nresolution of ratification of the Convention\u201d).The IJ denied petitioner\u2019s applications for\nasylum and the withholding of removal, but granted him deferral of\nremoval. The BIA affirmed. In their view, petitioner\u2019s conduct\nobjectively qualified as assistance or participation in the\npersecution of others based on religion. Seeante, at 3\n(majority opinion). Relying onFedorenko, the IJ and BIA\nfound that even if petitioner was \u201ccompelled to participate as a\nprison guard\u201d against his wishes, his \u201cmotivation and intent are\nirrelevant to the issue of whether he \u2018assisted\u2019 in persecution.\u201dIbid.(some internal quotation marks omitted). Therefore,\npetitioner was ineligible for asylum or the withholding of removal\nunder the INA. The IJ and BIA agreed, however, that petitioner\nqualified for deferral of removal because it is \u201cmore likely than\nnot that he would be tortured\u201d if returned to Eritrea given that\nits \u201cgovernment has used deadly force and threatened to use deadly\nforce against deserters.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 7a\u20138a, 20a, 19a.\nThe Court of Appeals affirmed. SeeNegusiev.Gonzales, 231 Fed. Appx. 325, 326 (CA5 2007)(per\ncuriam).IIAs with all statutory\ninterpretation questions, construction of the INA\u2019s persecutor bar\nmust begin with the plain language of the statute. See Jimenezv.Quarterman, 555 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 5)\n(citingLamiev.United States Trustee,540 U. S. 526, 534\n(2004)). If the text of a statute governing agency action\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018directly addresse[s] the precise question at issue,\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nthen, \u201c\u00a0\u2018that is the end of the matter; for the court, as well\nas the agency, must give effect to the unambiguously expressed\nintent of Congress.\u2019\u00a0\u201dNational Assn. of Home\nBuildersv.Defenders of Wildlife,551 U. S. 664, ___\n(2007) (slip op., at 18) (quotingChevron U. S.\u00a0A.\nInc.v.Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,467 U. S. 837,\n842\u2013843 (1984)).AA court must first \u201clook to the\nparticular statutory language at issue.\u201dK mart Corp.v.Cartier, Inc.,486 U. S. 281, 291\n(1988). As the majority acknowledges, seeante, at 5\u20136,\nthe text of the INA\u2019s persecutor bar neither includes the term\n\u201cvoluntary\u201d nor contains an exception for involuntary, coerced\nconduct. The statute instead applies toanyalien \u201cwho\nordered, incited, assisted, or otherwise participated in the\npersecution of any person\u201d on account of a protected ground.\n\u00a7\u00a71101(a)(42), 1158(b)(2)(A)(i), 1231(b)(3)(B)(i).The statute\u2019s key terms also do\nnot imply any voluntariness requirement for persecution. Under the\nordinary meaning of the term \u201cpersecution\u201d at the time of the\nstatute\u2019s enactment in 1980 and its reenactment in 1996, the act of\npersecution alone is sufficient to classify one\u2019s conduct as\npersecution. See Webster\u2019s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary 877\n(1991) (hereinafter Webster\u2019s Ninth) (defining \u201cpersecution\u201d as\n\u201cthe act or practice of persecuting esp. those who differ in\norigin, religion, or social outlook\u201d); see also Webster\u2019s New\nCollegiate Dictionary 855 (1975) (hereinafter Webster\u2019s) (same).\nThe term itself includes no intrinsicmens rearequirement. As a result, an individual can \u201cpersecute\u201d\u2014meaning\n\u201charass in a manner designed to injure, grieve, or afflict\u201d\u2014without\nhaving designed the act or intended for injury, grief, or\naffliction to occur. Webster\u2019s Ninth 877; see also Webster\u2019s 855\n(same).The persecutor bar\u2019s inclusion of those who\n\u201cassist\u201d or \u201cparticipate\u201d confirms that it does not include a\nvoluntariness requirement. The term \u201cassist\u201d is defined as \u201cto give\nsupport or aid,\u201d Webster\u2019s Ninth 109, or \u201cto help,\u201d Oxford American\nDictionary 36 (1980) (hereinafter Oxford). See also Black\u2019s Law\nDictionary 111 (5th ed. 1979) (hereinafter Black\u2019s) (defining\n\u201cassist\u201d as \u201c[t]o help; aid; succor; lend countenance or\nencouragement to; participate in as an auxiliary\u201d). And\n\u201cparticipate\u201d means simply \u201cto take part,\u201d Webster\u2019s Ninth 858, or\n\u201cto have a share, to take part in something,\u201d Oxford 487; see also\nBlack\u2019s 1007 (defining \u201cparticipate\u201d as \u201c[t]o receive or have a\npart or share of; to partake of; experience in common with others;\nto have or enjoy a part or share in common with others\u201d).\nAccordingly, this Court has concluded that the ordinary meanings of\n\u201cassist\u201d and \u201cparticipate\u201d do not \u201cconnote voluntariness.\u201dPennsylvania Dept. of Correctionsv.Yeskey,524 U. S. 206,\n211 (1998) (participate); see alsoFedorenko, 449 U. S.,\nat 512 (assist). These are \u201cterms and concepts of breadth,\u201dRussellov.United States,464 U. S. 16, 21\u201322\n(1983), that require only that an individual take \u201csomepart in\u201d an activity, or help it to occur in some way.Revesv.Ernst & Young,507 U. S. 170, 178\u2013179\n(1993) (emphasis in original). Even if participation or assistance\nis coerced, it remains participation or assistance just the\nsame.BIn addition to the particular\nstatutory section of the INA before the Court, \u201cthe language and\ndesign of the statute as a whole\u201d is instructive in determining the\nprovision\u2019s plain meaning.K mart Corp., supra, at 291;\nsee alsoAmoco Production Co.v.Gambell,480 U. S. 531,\n552\u2013553 (1987). Here, the INA\u2019s design and structure buttress the\nconclusion that the persecutor bar applies irrespective of\nvoluntariness.First, Congress has evidenced its\nability to both specifically require voluntary conduct and\nexplicitly exclude involuntary conduct in other provisions of the\nINA. Seeinfra, at 15\u201316. For example, Congress has barred\nadmission to the United States of totalitarian party members unless\ntheir membership was \u201cinvoluntary,\u201d 8 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a71182(a)(3)(D)(ii), and it has provided for the termination of\nasylum when an alien \u201chas voluntarily availed himself or herself\u201d\nof another country\u2019s protections, \u00a71158(c)(2)(D). \u201c[W]here Congress\nincludes particular language in one section of a statute but omits\nit in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed\nthat Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate\ninclusion or exclusion.\u201dRussello, supra, at 23 (internal\nquotation marks omitted); see,e.g.,Barnhartv.Sigmon Coal Co.,534 U. S. 438, 452\u2013454\n(2002). The absence of a voluntariness requirement in the INA\npersecutor bar is no exception.Second, federal immigration law provides\ncalibrated remedies, which include partial refuge for specified\naliens who have both suffered from and inflicted persecution. Those\nwho have been persecuted and have not engaged in persecution may\nreceive both asylum and the withholding of removal.\n\u00a7\u00a71231(b)(3)(A), 1158(b)(1)(A). Those at the other end of the\nspectrum, who have not been persecuted but have persecuted others,\nmay not receive either asylum or the withholding of removal.\n\u00a7\u00a71231(b)(3)(B)(i), 1158(b)(2)(A)(i). And finally, for many\nindividuals who (like petitioner) have both persecuted others and\nbeen persecuted, the scheme provides temporary refuge; they will\nreceive deferral of removal under the CAT if they will face torture\nupon their return to their home country. CAT Policy (a), at 263;\nsee also 8 CFR \u00a7\u00a71208.13(a), 1208.16(d)(2).Where \u201cCongress has enacted a comprehensive\nscheme and has deliberately targeted specific problems with\nspecific solutions,\u201d courts should not read one part of the\nlegislative regime (the INA) to provide a different, and\nconflicting, solution to a problem that has already been\nspecifically addressed elsewhere in the federal immigration regime\n(regulations implementing the CAT).Varity Corp.v.Howe,516\nU. S. 489, 519 (1996) (Thomas, J., dissenting); see alsoTransamerica Mortgage Advisors, Inc.v.Lewis,444 U. S. 11, 19\n(1979). Federal law provides only partial protection to a victim of\npersecution who has also engaged in persecution, voluntarily or\nnot. There simply is no justification for writing into the INA\u2019s\npersecutor bar the greater protections of asylum and the\nwithholding of removal for individuals who were coerced into\nengaging in persecution. That is, the \u201cassumption of inadvertent\nomission\u201d of a voluntariness requirement in the INA \u201cis rendered\nespecially suspect upon close consideration of [a statute\u2019s]\ninterlocking, interrelated, and interdependent remedial scheme\u201d\nthat addresses the specific problem at issue in a conflicting way.Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co.v.Russell,473 U. S. 134,\n146\u2013147 (1985).[Footnote 2]CFinally, Congress is aware of a\njudicial interpretation of statutory language and \u201cadopt[s] that\ninterpretation when it re-enacts a statute without change.\u201dLorillardv.Pons,434 U. S. 575, 580\n(1978); see alsoTraynorv.Turnage,485 U. S. 535, 546\n(1988); 2B N. Singer & J. Singer, Sutherland on Statutory\nConstruction \u00a749.9, pp. 127\u2013133 (7th ed. 2008). Here, the statutory\nand decisional backdrop against which Congress enacted the INA\u2019s\npersecutor bar counsels against grafting a voluntariness\nrequirement onto the statute.When Congress enacted the INA\u2019s\npersecutor bar, it essentially retained the language used in\nsimilar predecessor statutes. Under the 1948 DPA persecutor bar,\nentry was denied to all who \u201c\u00a0\u2018assisted the enemy in\npersecuting civil[ians].\u2019\u00a0\u201dFedorenko, 449 U. S., at\n495 (quoting 62 Stat. 3051). In 1950, Congress added a second\npersecutor bar to the DPA that applied \u201cto any person who advocated\nor assisted in the persecution of any person because of race,\nreligion, or national origin.\u201d \u00a713, 64 Stat. 227. In the years that\nfollowed, Congress continued to use this same broad language in\ndenying asylum to specific categories of persecutors. See,e.g., \u00a7105, 91 Stat. 1224 (denying permanent residence to\naliens from Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia \u201cwho ordered, assisted, or\notherwise participated in the persecution of any person because of\nrace, religion, or political opinion\u201d); 8 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7\u00a71182(a)(3)(E), 1227(a)(4)(D)) (authorizing the exclusion of\nanyone who had been associated with Nazi forces and had \u201cordered,\nincited, assisted, or otherwise participated in the persecution of\nany person because of race, religion, national origin, or political\nopinion\u201d); \u00a714(a), 67 Stat. 406 (imposing persecutor bar on \u201cany\nperson who personally advocated or assisted in the persecution of \u2026\n[a] group of persons because of race, religion, or national\norigin\u201d).Congress then enacted the INA bar in 1980.\nThis statute comprehensively labeled as a persecutor \u201cany person\nwho ordered, incited, assisted, or otherwise participated in the\npersecution of any person on account of race, religion,\nnationality, membership in a particular social group, or political\nopinion.\u201d \u00a7201(a), 94 Stat. 102\u2013103. Congress reenacted the INA\u2019s\npersecutor bar in 1996 and retained its breadth. See Illegal\nImmigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996\n(IIRIRA), \u00a7\u00a7305(b)(3)(B)(i), 601(a)(1), 604(b)(2)(A)(i), 110 Stat.\n3009\u2013602, 689, 691.Congress\u2019 uninterrupted use of this broad\nstatutory language, which parallels the persecutor bars dating back\nto 1948, was not accidental. By the time of the 1996 reenactment,\nthis Court had specifically interpreted the plain language of the\npredecessor bars to apply regardless of the voluntariness of a\npersecutor\u2019s conduct. SeeFedorenko, supra, at 512 (1948\nDPA bar); see alsoUnited Statesv.Koreh, 59\nF.\u00a03d 431, 439 (CA3 1995) (1950 DPA bar);United\nStatesv.Schmidt, 923 F.\u00a02d 1253, 1258 (CA7\n1991) (1948 DPA bar);Maikovskisv.INS, 773\nF.\u00a02d 435, 445\u2013446 (CA2 1985) (8 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71251(a)(19)\n(1982 ed.), transferred to \u00a71227(a)(4)(D) (2006 ed.)). In\nparticular, this Court had held that the phrase in the 1948 DPA\nbar, \u201cassisted the enemy in persecuting civil[ians],\u201d contained no\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018involuntary assistance\u2019 exception.\u201dFedorenko,449\nU. S., at 512. Rather, the statute\u2019s \u201cplain language\u201d made clear\nthat \u201can individual\u2019s service as a concentration camp armed\nguard\u2014whether voluntary or involuntary\u2014made him ineligible for a\nvisa.\u201dIbid.In light of this legal backdrop, Congress\u2019\ndecisions in 1980 and 1996 to retain a persecutor bar that broadly\napplies to anyone who \u201cassisted, or otherwise participated in the\npersecution\u201d of any person, \u00a7\u00a71158(b)(2)(A)(i), 1231(b)(3)(B), is\nsignificant evidence that Congress did not intend to include any\ninvoluntariness exception in the INA bar. This Court must assume,\nabsent textual proof to the contrary, that Congress was aware of\ntheFedorenkodecision when it reenacted the persecutor\nbar and thus \u201cadopt[ed] that interpretation when it re-enact[ed\nthe] statute without change,\u201dLorillard,supra,at 580.DIn sum, the INA\u2019s persecutor bar\ndoes not require that assistance or participation in persecution be\nvoluntary or uncoerced to fall within the statute\u2019s reach. It\ninstead \u201cmandates precisely\u201d what it says: \u201c[A]n individual\u2019s\nservice as a [prison] camp armed guard\u2014whether voluntary or\ninvoluntary\u2014ma[kes] him ineligible for\u201d asylum or withholding of\nremoval if the guard\u2019s service involved assistance or participation\nin the persecution of another person on account of a protected\nground.Fedorenko, supra, at 512. Here, it is undisputed\nthat petitioner served at a prison camp where guards persecuted\nprisoners because of their religious beliefs. Seeante, at\n2\u20133 (majority opinion). It also is undisputed that petitioner\ncarried out the persecution by preventing prisoners from escaping\nand by standing guard while at least one prisoner died from sun\nexposure.Ibid. Petitioner, therefore, \u201cassisted, or\notherwise participated\u201d in persecution and thus is statutorily\ndisqualified from receiving asylum or withholding of removal under\nthe INA.[Footnote\n3]IIIThe majority\nnevertheless concludes the statute\u2019s \u201csilence,\u201dante,at\n6, creates ambiguity, and therefore remands the case to the BIA for\nit to determine, in the first instance, whether persecution must be\nvoluntary to fall within the terms of the INA\u2019s persecutor bar.\n\u201cThe Court\u2019s efforts to derive ambiguity from th[e] utmost clarity\u201d\nof the persecutor bar, however, \u201care unconvincing\u201d in every\nrespect.INSv.St. Cyr,533 U. S. 289, 329\n(2001) (Scalia, J., dissenting).The majority principally finds ambiguity in\nthe statutory text because it does not include either the word\n\u201cvoluntary\u201d or the word \u201cinvoluntary.\u201d Seeante, at 7. But\na statute cannot be deemed ambiguous until the court \u201cexhaust[s]\nthe aid of the \u2018traditional tools of statutory construction\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nand determines that Congress did not resolve the issue under\nconsideration.Clarkv.Martinez,543 U. S. 371, 402\n(2005) (Thomas, J., dissenting) (quotingChevron, 467 U.\nS., at 843, n. 9). Deeming a statute with broad terms to be\nambiguous for that reason alone essentially requires Congress\neither to obey a judicially imposed clear-statement rule or accept\nthe risk that the courts may refuse to give full effect to a\nstatute\u2019s plain meaning in the name ofChevrondeference.\nNot every difficult question of statutory construction amounts to a\nstatutory gap for a federal agency to fill. Seeante, at\n1\u20134 (opinion of Stevens, J.). And the Court should not, \u201cin the\nname of deference, abdicate its responsibility to interpret a\nstatute\u201d simply because it requires some effort.Global\nCrossing Telecommunications, Inc.v.Metrophones\nTelecommunications, Inc.,550 U. S. 45, 77 (2007)\n(Thomas, J., dissenting).The majority\nmakes no attempt to apply the \u201ctraditional tools of statutory\nconstruction\u201d to the persecutor bar before retreating to ambiguity.\nSeeante, at 5\u20136. Rather, it merely observes that Congress\ncould have spoken more directly to the issue, which it finds\nsufficient to render the statute ambiguous on this score.Ante, at 6. But the absence of a phrase specifying that\nthe provision applies to both involuntary and voluntary conduct is\nnot definitive proof of ambiguity. It is certainly correct that\nCongress \u201c\u00a0\u2018could have spoken in clearer terms,\u2019\u00a0\u201dClark, 543 U. S., at 402 (Thomas, J., dissenting), as it\nalmost always can in any statute. However, this \u201cproves nothing\u201d in\nevaluating whether the statute is ambiguous.Ibid.The\nquestion before the Court instead is whether Congress has provided\nan unambiguous answer in the plain language that it chose to use.\nHere, for the reasons just explained, the traditional tools of\nstatutory interpretation show with \u201cutmost clarity,\u201dSt. Cyr,\nsupra, at 329, that the statute applies regardless of the\nvoluntariness of the alien who participates or assists in\npersecution.[Footnote\n4]The majority\nalso finds ambiguity based on differences between the INA and the\nDPA statutory bar considered inFedorenko. In particular,\nthe majority points to theFedorenkoCourt\u2019s reliance on a\nsecond part of the DPA persecutor bar, which applied to those who\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018voluntarilyassisted the enemy forces \u2026 in their\noperations against the United Nations.\u2019\u00a0\u201d 449 U. S., at 495,\nand n.\u00a03 (quoting 62 Stat. 3052; emphasis added). The Court\nnoted that \u201c[u]nder traditional principles of statutory\nconstruction, the deliberate omission of the word \u2018voluntary\u2019 from\n\u00a72(a),\u201d which addressed the assistance of persecution\u2014but not from\n\u00a72(b)\u2014\u201ccompel[led] the conclusion that the statute madeallthose who assisted in the persecution of civilians\nineligible for visas.\u201dId.,at 512. According to the\nmajority, because the INA persecutor bar, unlike the DPA bar, does\nnot include a provision limited by the word \u201cvoluntarily\u201d adjacent\nto the provision that is not so limited, the absence of the adverb\nhere cannot carry the significance given it inFedorenko.\nSeeante, at 7.The majority\u2019s\nreasoning is flawed. The mere fact that the INA\u2019s persecutor bar is\nnot accompanied by a neighboring provision containing the word\n\u201cvoluntarily\u201d does not negate the significance of the term\u2019s\nabsence when other INA provisions are explicitly limited to actions\nundertaken voluntarily. As noted above, seesupra,at 7,\nthe INA imposes a voluntariness requirement in a host of statutory\nprovisions, see,e.g., 8 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71158(c)(2)(D)\n(terminating asylum when alien has \u201cvoluntarily\u201d availed himself of\nthe protection of his country); \u00a7\u00a71182(a)(3)(D)(i)\u2013(ii) (denying\nadmission and naturalization to those who have been members of, or\naffiliated with, \u201cthe Communist or any other totalitarian party\u201d\nunless that membership or affiliation was \u201cinvoluntary\u201d);\n\u00a71182(d)(3)(B)(i) (denying admission to those who have \u201cvoluntarily\nand knowingly\u201d engaged in, endorsed, espoused, or persuaded others\nto endorse, espouse, or support terrorist activity); \u00a71229c(a)(1)\n(allowing an alien to \u201cvoluntarily\u201d depart the United States);\n\u00a7\u00a71424(a), (d) (precluding naturalization for members of certain\ntotalitarian parties, unless membership was \u201cinvoluntary\u201d);\n\u00a71481(a) (providing for loss of nationality by \u201cvoluntarily\u201d\nperforming certain specified acts with the intention of\nrelinquishing nationality).[Footnote 5]In the\nimmigration and naturalization context, then, Congress is certainly\ncapable of declaring its preference for a voluntariness\nrequirement. That Congress\u2019 explicit references to voluntariness\nappear in other sections of this particular statutory scheme,\nrather than in subsections of \u00a7\u00a71158 or 1231, is immaterial. Cf.Rusello,464 U. S., at 23;Barnhart, 534 U. S.,\nat 452\u2013454. And the fact that Congress, in the course of making\nstructural revisions to the statutory regime, eliminated the\nspecific dichotomy the Court noted inFedorenkodoes not\nundermine the critical point: The INA expressly includes a\nvoluntariness requirement in several places but does not impose\nsuch a requirement in the persecution bar. Thus, the omission of\nthe word \u201cvoluntarily\u201d from the persecutor bar in the INA is just\nas conclusive as its omission from the persecutor bar in the DPA.\nWith respect to both statutes, the deliberate omission \u201ccompels the\nconclusion that the statute madeallthose who assisted in\nthe persecution of civilians ineligible for visas.\u201d 449 U. S., at\n512.Finally, the\nmajority concludes that the DPA bar is distinguishable from the INA\nbar because the former was enacted in the context of the\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018\u00a0\u201ccrime against humanity that [was] involved in the\nconcentration camp,\u201d\u00a0\u2019\u00a0\u201d which was so horrific that it is\nin a category all its own.Ante, at 8 (quotingFedorenko, supra, at 511, n. 32). In that unique context,\nthe majority reasons, it made sense to exclude \u201ceven those involved\nin nonculpable, involuntary assistance in Nazi persecution.\u201dIbid.But the majority cannot intend to suggest that all\nacts of persecution during the Second World War were inherently\nmore depraved or reprehensible than all acts of persecution that\nhave occurred in the decades since the INA\u2019s\nenactment.Certainly, no\nsuch conclusion is compelled by the statutory text. Congress has\nsteadfastly condemnedallacts of persecution. See 22 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a76401(a)(5)\u2013(7) (noting that \u201cCongress has recognized\nand denounced acts of religious persecution,\u201d which can be \u201csevere\nand violent\u201d and \u201cparticularly widespread, systematic, and heinous\nunder totalitarian governments and in countries with militant\npoliticized religious majorities\u201d); \u00a76401(b)(5) (announcing that it\nis the \u201cpolicy of the United States\u201d to \u201cstan[d] with the\npersecuted\u201d); \u00a7501, 78 Stat. 1015 (\u201cThe Congress condemns the\npersecution of any persons because of their religion\u201d); Refugee Act\nof 1980, \u00a7101(a), 94 Stat. 102 (\u201cThe Congress declares that it is\nthe historic policy of the United States to respond to the urgent\nneeds of persons subject to persecution in their homelands\u201d). There\nis no reason to deny the INA persecutor bar its full meaning based\non a speculative assumption that Congress, in 1980, could not have\nmeant to oppose persecution quite as intensely as it did in the\naftermath of World War II. Rather, the INA\u2019s persecutor bar\nnaturally extends to all acts of persecution and, therefore,\nrequires the denial of asylum and withholding of removal for \u201ceven\nthose involved in nonculpable, involuntary assistance in \u2026\npersecution.\u201dAnte,at 8 (majority\nopinion).IVBecause I conclude that the INA\u2019s persecutor\nbar applies whether or not petitioner\u2019s assistance or participation\nin persecution was voluntary, and because it is conceded that\npetitioner assisted and participated in persecution while serving\nas an armed prison guard in Eritrea, I would affirm the decision of\nthe Court of Appeals. Accordingly, I respectfully\ndissent.Footnote 1\u201cDeferral of\nremoval\u201d was created to accommodate Congress\u2019 direction to exclude\nthose who fall within the INA persecutor bar \u201c[t]o the maximum\nextent consistent with the obligations of the United States under\nthe [CAT]\u201d to not return an alien to a country in which he or she\nwill be tortured. CAT Policy (c), at 263. To accomplish that goal,\ndeferral of removal provides \u201ca less permanent form of protection\nthan withholding of removal and one that is more easily and quickly\nterminated if it becomes possible to remove the alien consistent\nwith Article 3\u201d of the CAT, 64 Fed. Reg. 8480 (1999), while also\n\u201censur[ing] that [such aliens] are not returned to a country where\nthey would be tortured,\u201did.\u00b8 at 8481.Footnote 2It also is\nimportant to acknowledge that the object of the INA is to codify\nCongress\u2019 policy decisions \u201c\u00a0\u2018pertaining to the entry of\naliens and their right to remain\u2019\u00a0\u201d in the United\nStates\u2014decisions that are \u201c\u00a0\u2018entrusted exclusively to\nCongress.\u2019\u00a0\u201dKleindienstv.Mandel,408 U. S. 753, 766, 767\n(1972) (quotingGalvanv.Press,347 U. S. 522, 531\u2013532\n(1954)). In fact, \u201cover no conceivable subject is the legislative\npower of Congress more complete than it is over\u201d the decision of\nCongress to admit or to exclude aliens.Oceanic Steam Nav.\nCo.v.Stranahan,214 U. S. 320, 339\n(1909). Courts therefore must enforce the immigration policy\ndecision reflected in a statute\u2019s plain terms, even if Congress has\nchosen \u201cto forbid the entrance of foreigners within its dominions\u201d\naltogether,Fong Yue Tingv.United States,149 U. S. 698,\n705 (1893). Likewise, here, where Congress has made a judgment\nabout which persons to admit and exclude from the country, it is\nnot for this Court to question the wisdom of that\nchoice.Footnote 3Justice\nStevens also finds the language of the INA\u2019s persecutor bar\n\u201cplain,\u201d but concludes that it must incorporate a culpability\nrequirement because the statute applies to those whose \u201cacts are of\na \u2018criminal nature.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Seeante, at 7, 9 (opinion\nconcurring in part and dissenting in part). I disagree. The\ndecision to admit an alien is a matter of legislative grace, see\nn.\u00a02,supra, for which judicial review has been\n\u201cconsistently classified\u201d as civil in nature,Harisiadesv.Shaughnessy,342 U. S. 580, 594\n(1952); see alsoZadvydasv.Davis,533 U. S. 678, 720\n(2001) (Kennedy, J., dissenting) (explaining that \u201c\u00a0\u2018an alien\nseeking initial admission to the United States requests a privilege\nand has no constitutional rights regarding his application, for the\npower to admit or exclude aliens is a sovereign prerogative\u2019\u00a0\u201d\n(quotingLandonv.Plasencia,459 U. S. 21, 32\n(1982))). There is no warrant to read criminal-law requirements\ninto a statute that is \u201cnonpunitive in purpose and effect.\u201dZadvydas, supra, at 690. Further, the conclusory\npronouncement in the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner\nfor Refugees\u2019 Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining\nRefugee Status \u00b6162 (reedited Jan. 1992), that \u201cit has to be\nassumed, although this is not specifically stated, that the acts\ncovered by the present clause must also be of a criminal nature,\u201d\nis insufficient to require criminal proof to deny withholding of\nremoval, contra,ante, at 9\u201310 (opinion of Stevens, J.).\nThe United Nations handbook \u201cis not binding on the Attorney\nGeneral, the BIA, or United States courts.\u201dINSv.Aguirre-Aguirre,526 U. S. 415, 427\n(1999).Footnote 4Because this\nCourt should not delegate the interpretation of the persecutor\nbar\u2019s plain meaning to a federal agency, seeBoard of\nGovernors, FRSv.Dimension Financial Corp.,474 U. S. 361, 368\n(1986), it is largely irrelevant whether the BIA properly relied onFedorenkov.United States,449 U. S. 490(1981), in interpreting\nthe statute, seeante, at 9\u201311 (majority opinion);ante, at 2 (Scalia, J., concurring). In any event, the\nBIA\u2019s construction of the INA\u2019s persecutor bar correctly reflected\nthe text of the provision. There is no reason to remand the\nquestion to the agency when only one construction of the statute is\npermissible and the agency\u2019s original decision adopted that proper\nconstruction. SeeNational Cable & Telecommunications\nAssn.v.Brand X Internet Services,545 U. S. 967, 982\u2013985\n(2005).Footnote 5Moreover, in\nthe Refugee Act of 1980, which added the persecutor bar to the INA,\nCongress separately codified its desire to \u201cpromote opportunities\nfor resettlement or voluntary repatriation.\u201d \u00a7101(a), 94 Stat. 102,\nnote following 8 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71521. In 1996, when Congress\nreenacted the statutory text, it retained the persecution bar\u2019s\nbroad language while again restricting other sections to voluntary\nconduct. See IIRIRA, \u00a7304, 110 Stat. 3009\u2013587 (relating to\n\u201cvoluntary departure\u201d), \u00a7402,id.,at 3009\u2013656 (relating\nto \u201cvoluntary\u201d participation in pilot programs for confirming\nemployment eligibility), \u00a7604,id.,at 3009\u2013690 (providing\nfor termination of asylum when alien \u201cvoluntarily\u201d takes certain\nactions).",
