    "text": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES_________________No. 14\u2013378_________________STEPHEN DOMINICK McFADDEN, PETITIONERv.UNITED STATESon writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the fourth circuit[June 18, 2015]Chief Justice Roberts, concurring in part and\nconcurring in the judgment.I join the Court\u2019s opinion, except to the extent\nthat it says the Government can satisfy the mental state\nrequirement of Section 841(a)(1) \u201cby showing that the defendant\nknew the identity of the substance he possessed.\u201dAnte, at\n5. Section 841(a)(1) makes it \u201cunlawful for any person knowingly\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. to manufacture, distribute, or dispense\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. a controlled substance.\u201d As the Court points out,\nthe word \u201cknowingly\u201d applies \u201cnot just to the statute\u2019s verbs, but\nalso to the object of those verbs\u2014\u2018a controlled substance.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAnte, at 4 (emphasis deleted). That suggests that a\ndefendant needs to know more than the identity of the substance; he\nneeds to know that the substance iscontrolled. See,e.g.,United Statesv.Howard, 773 F.\u00a03d\n519, 526 (CA4 2014);United Statesv.Washington, 596\nF.\u00a03d 926, 944 (CA8 2010);United Statesv.Rogers, 387 F.\u00a03d 925, 935 (CA7 2004).In cases involving well-known drugs such as\nheroin, a defendant\u2019s knowledge of the identity of the substance\ncan be compelling evidence that he knows the substance is\ncontrolled. SeeUnited Statesv.Turcotte, 405\nF.\u00a03d 515, 525 (CA7 2005). But that is not necessarily true\nfor lesser known drugs. A pop quiz for any reader who doubts the\npoint: Two drugs\u2014dextromethorphan and hydrocodone\u2014are both used as\ncough suppressants. They are also both used as recreational drugs.\nWhich one is a controlled substance?[1]*The Court says that knowledge of the substance\u2019s\niden-tity suffices because \u201cignorance of the law is typically no\ndefense to criminal prosecution.\u201dAnte,at 5. I agree that\nis \u201ctypically\u201d true. But when \u201cthere is a legal element in the\ndefinition of the offense,\u201d a person\u2019s lack of knowledge regarding\nthat legal elementcanbe a defense.Liparotav.United States, 471 U.\u00a0S. 419 , n.\u00a09 (1985). And\nhere, there is arguably a legal element in Section 841(a)(1)\u2014that\nthe substance be \u201ccontrolled.\u201dThe analogy the Court drew inLiparotawas to a charge of receipt of stolen property: It is no defense\nthat the defendant did not know such receipt was illegal, but it is\na defense that he did not know the property was stolen. Here, the\nargument goes, it is no defense that a defendant did not know it\nwas illegal to possess a controlled substance, but it is a defense\nthat he did not know the substance was controlled.Ultimately, the Court\u2019s statements on this issue\nare not necessary to its conclusion that the District Court\u2019s jury\ninstructions \u201cdid not fully convey the mental state required by the\nAnalogue Act.\u201dAnte,at 10. Those statements should\ntherefore not be regarded as controlling if the issue arises in a\nfuture case.Notes1* The answer is\nhydrocodone.",
