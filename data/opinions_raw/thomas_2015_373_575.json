PETITIONERSv.LEARJET, INC.,\net\u00a0al.on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for\nthe ninth circuit[April 21, 2015]Justice Thomas, concurring in part and concurring in the\njudgment.I agree with much of the majority\u2019s application of our\nprecedents governing pre-emption under the Natural Gas Act. I write\nseparately to reiterate my view that \u201cimplied pre-emption doctrines\nthat wander far from the statutory text are inconsistent with the\nConstitution.\u201dWyethv.Levine,555 U.\u00a0S. 555,583\n(2009) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment). The Supremacy Clause\nof our Constitution \u201cgives \u2018supreme\u2019 status only to those [federal\nlaws] that are \u2018made in Pursuance\u2019\u00a0\u201d of it.Id.,at 585\n(quoting Art.\u00a0VI, cl. 2). And to be \u201cmade in Pursuance\u201d of the\nConstitution, a law must fall within one of Congress\u2019 enumerated\npowers and be promulgated in accordance with the lawmaking\nprocedures set forth in that document.Id.,at 585\u2013586. \u201cThe\nSupremacy Clause thus requires that pre-emptive effect be given\nonly to those federal standards and policies that are set forth in,\nor necessarily follow from, the statutory text that was produced\nthrough the constitutionally required bicameral and presentment\nprocedures.\u201dId.,at 586.In light of this constitutional requirement, I have doubts about\nthe legitimacy of this Court\u2019s precedents concern-ing the\npre-emptive scope of the Natural Gas Act, see,e.g.,Northern Natural Gas Co.v.State Corporation Comm\u2019n of\nKan.,372 U.\u00a0S. 84\u201392 (1963) (defining the pre-empted field\nin light of the \u201cobjective[s]\u201d of the Act). Neither party, however,\nhas asked us to overrule these longstanding precedents or \u201cto\novercome the presumption ofstare decisisthat attaches to\u201d\nthem.Kurnsv.Railroad Friction Products Corp., 565\nU.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 7). And even under these\nprecedents, the challenged state antitrust laws fall outside the\npre-empted field. Because the Court today avoids extending its\nearlier questionable precedents, I concur in its judgment and join\nall but Part I\u2013A of its opinion.",
