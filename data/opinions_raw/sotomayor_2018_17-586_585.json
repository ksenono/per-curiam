In reaching\nits desired result, the majority commits three fundamental errors\nalong the way.First, the majority disregards the strict limits\nof our appellate jurisdiction and reads into the District Court\norders a nonexistent injunction to justify its premature\nintervention. Second, the majority indulges Texas\u2019 distorted\nreading of the District Court\u2019s meticulous orders, mistakenly\nfaulting the court for supposedly shifting the burden of proof to\nthe State to show that it cured the taint of past discrimination,\nall the while ignoring the clear language and unambiguous factual\nfindings of the orders below. Third, the majority elides the\nstandard of review that guides our resolution of the factual\ndisputes in these appeals\u2014indeed, mentioning it only in passing\u2014and\nselectively parses through the facts. As a result of these errors,\nTexas is guaranteed continued use of much of its discriminatory\nmaps.This disregard of both precedent and fact comes\nat serious costs to our democracy. It means that, after years of\nlitigation and undeniable proof of intentional discrimination,\nminority voters in Texas\u2014despite constituting a majority of the\npopulation within the State\u2014will continue to be underrepresented in\nthe political process. Those voters must return to the polls in\n2018 and 2020 with the knowledge that their ability to exercise\nmeaningfully their right to vote has been burdened by the\nmanipulation of district lines specifically designed to target\ntheir communities and minimize their political will. The\nfundamental right to vote is too precious to be disregarded in this\nmanner. I dissent.IAThe first obstacle the majority faces in its\nquest to intervene in these cases is jurisdictional. The statute\nthat governs our jurisdiction over these appeals is 28\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71253, which provides that \u201cany party may appeal\nto the Supreme Court from an order granting or denying\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. an interlocutory or permanent injunction in any\ncivil action, suit or proceeding required by any Act of Congress to\nbe heard and determined by a district court of three judges.\u201d\nUnlike the more typical certiorari process, for cases falling\nwithin \u00a71253, appellate review in this Court is mandatory. That is\nwhy, until today, this Court has repeatedly recognized and adhered\nto a \u201clong-established rule\u201d requiring \u201cstrict construction\u201d of\nthis jurisdictional statute \u201cto protect our appellate docket.\u201dStainbackv.Mo Hock Ke Lok Po, 336 U.\u00a0S. 368,\n375, 378 (1949); see,e.g.,Gonzalezv.Automatic\nEmployees Credit Union, 419 U.\u00a0S. 90, 98 (1974) (noting\nthat \u201conly a narrow construction\u201d of our jurisdiction under \u00a71253\n\u201cis consonant with the overriding policy, historically encouraged\nby Congress, of minimizing the mandatory docket of this Court in\nthe interests of sound judicial administration\u201d);Gunnv.University Comm. to End War in Viet Nam, 399 U.\u00a0S. 383,\n387 (1970) (similar);Goldsteinv.Cox, 396\nU.\u00a0S. 471, 477\u2013478 (1970) (rejecting a construction of \u00a71253\nthat would \u201cinvolve an expansion of [our] mandatory appellate\njurisdiction,\u201d even where the statutory text \u201cis subject to [that]\nconstruction,\u201d in light of \u201ccanon of construction\u201d requiring that\n\u00a71253 be \u201cnarrowly construed\u201d);Phillipsv.United\nStates, 312 U.\u00a0S. 246, 248\u2013250 (1941) (explaining that\n\u00a71253 is an \u201cexceptional procedure\u201d and that \u201cinasmuch as this\nprocedure .\u00a0.\u00a0. brings direct review of a district court\nto this Court, any loose construction .\u00a0.\u00a0. would defeat\nthe purposes of Congress .\u00a0.\u00a0. to keep within narrow\nconfines our appellate docket\u201d).In line with that command, this Court has held\nthat a ruling on the merits will not suffice to invoke our\nmandatory appellate jurisdiction in the absence of an order\ngranting or denying an injunction. In fact, even if a three-judge\ndistrict court unequivocally indicates that a state law must be\nenjoined as it stands, we have required more before accepting\nmandatory review. For example, the Court inGunnfound no\njurisdiction where the three-judge District Court held that a Texas\ndisturbing-the-peace statute was \u201c\u00a0\u2018impermissibly and\nunconstitutionally broad,\u2019\u00a0\u201d concluded that the plaintiffs\nwere \u201c\u00a0\u2018entitled to their declaratory judgment to that effect,\nand to injunctive relief against the enforcement of [the statute]\nas now worded, insofar as it may affect the rights guaranteed under\nthe First Amendment,\u2019\u00a0\u201d and stayed the mandate to allow the\nState to, \u201c\u00a0\u2018if it so desires, enact such disturbing-the-peace\nstatute as will meet constitutional requirements.\u2019\u00a0\u201d 399\nU.\u00a0S., at 386. Despite the District Court\u2019s resolution of the\nmerits and its clear indication that, unless amended, the\ndisturbing-the-peace statute would be enjoined, this Court\ndismissed an appeal from the State for want of jurisdiction,\nconcluding that the District Court merely wrote a \u201crather\ndiscursiveper curiamopinion\u201d and \u201cthere was no order of\nany kind either granting or denying an injunction\u2014interlocutory or\npermanent.\u201dId.,at 387. The Court explained that, in\naddition to the congressional command to \u201c\u00a0\u2018keep within narrow\nconfines our appellate docket,\u2019\u00a0\u201d other \u201cpolicy\nconsiderations\u201d counseled limiting \u201cour power of review,\u201d including\n\u201cthat until a district court issues an injunction, or enters an\norder denying one, it is simply not possible to know with any\ncertainty what the court has decided.\u201dId.,at 387\u2013388.\nThose considerations, the Court thought, were \u201cconspicuously\nevident\u201d in that case, where the opinion did not specify, for\ninstance, exactly what was to be enjoined or against whom the\ninjunction would run.Id.,at 388.Similarly,Whitcombv.Chavis, 403\nU.\u00a0S. 124 (1971), concerned a redistricting challenge in which\na three-judge District Court held that \u201ca redistricting of [the\nchallenged county was] necessitated\u201d and \u201cthat the evidence adduced\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. and the additional apportionment requirements set\nforth by the Supreme Court call[ed] for a redistricting of the\nentire state as to both houses of the General Assembly,\u201dChavisv.Whitcomb, 305 F.\u00a0Supp. 1364, 1391 (SD\nInd. 1969). Recognizing \u201cthat the federal judiciary functions\nwithin a system of federalism which entrusts the responsibility of\nlegislative apportionment and districting primarily to the state\nlegislature,\u201d the District Court afforded the Governor \u201ca\nreasonable opportunity to call a Special Session of the General\nAssembly of the State of Indiana so that it may enact legislation\nto redistrict the State and reapportion the legislative seats in\nthe General Assembly in accordance with federal constitutional\nrequirements and in compliance with [its] opinion.\u201dId.,at\n1392. The District Court gave the State a little over two months to\nenact new statutes \u201cto remedy the improper districting and\nmalapportionment.\u201dIbid.When the Governor appealed from\nthat order, this Court dismissed for want of jurisdiction because\n\u201cat [the] time no judgment had been entered and no injunction had\nbeen granted or denied.\u201d 403 U.\u00a0S.,at 138, n.\u00a019.\nThe findings of liability on the merits and the unequivocal\nindication that the redistricting and malapportionment violations\nhad to be remedied were not enough.BStraightforward application of this precedent\ncompels the conclusion that this Court lacks jurisdiction over\nthese appeals. Here, Texas appeals from two orders entered by the\nthree-judge District Court on August 15 and 24, 2017. Those orders\nconcern the constitutional and statutory challenges to Texas\u2019 State\nHouse and federal congressional redistricting plans, enacted by the\nTexas Legislature (hereinafter Legislature) in 2013 (hereinafter\nthe 2013 maps). As relevant here, the orders concerned Texas House\ndistricts in Bell County (HD54 and HD55), Dallas County (HD103,\nHD104, and HD105), Nueces County (HD32 and HD34), and Tarrant\nCounty (HD90), as well federal congressional districts encompassing\nNueces County (CD27) and parts of Travis County (CD35). The\nDistrict Court concluded that plaintiffs had proved intentional\ndiscrimination as to HD54, HD55, HD103, HD104, HD105, HD32, HD34,\nand CD27.[1] It also concluded\nthat plaintiffs had proved a \u201cresults\u201d violation under \u00a72 of the\nVoting Rights Act as to HD32, HD34, and CD27,[2] and had established a racial gerrymandering\nclaim as to HD90 and CD35.[3]Having ruled on the challengers\u2019 statutory and\nconstitutional claims, the District Court stated that all but one\nof the \u201cviolations must be remedied by either the Texas Legislature\nor [the District] Court.\u201d 274 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d 624, 686 (WD Tex.\n2017); see also 267 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d 750, 795 (WD Tex.\n2017).[4] With respect to the\n\u00a72 results violation concerning HD32 and HD34, however, the\nDistrict Court noted that it had yet to decide \u201cwhether \u00a72 requires\na remedy for this results violation.\u201dId.,at 783, 795. The\nDistrict Court then ordered \u201cthe [Texas] Office of the Attorney\nGeneral to file a written advisory within three business days\nstating whether the Legislature intends to take up redistricting in\nan effort to cure these violations and, if so, when the matter will\nbe considered.\u201d 274 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at 686; see also 267\nF.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at 795. The court went on: \u201cIf the Legislature\ndoes not intend to take up redistricting, the [District] Court will\nhold a hearing to consider remedial plans\u201d on September 5 and 6,\n2017, respecting the congressional and Texas House districts. 274\nF.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at 686\u2013687; see also 267 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at\n795. \u201cIn preparation for the hearing[s],\u201d the District Court\nordered the parties to confer and to \u201ctake immediate steps to\nconsult with their experts and mapdrawers and prepare\u201d maps to\npresent at those hearings. 274 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at 687; 267\nF.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at 795.The District Court went no further. Though there\nhad been a determination on the merits that Texas violated both the\nEqual Protection Clause and \u00a72 of the Voting Rights Act with\nrespect to a number of districts in the 2013 maps, the District\nCourt did not enjoin use of the 2013 maps for the upcoming 2018\nelections. For instance, with respect to the congressional map, the\nDistrict Court explained that its order \u201conly partially\naddresse[d]\u201d the challengers\u2019 claims, as it had \u201cbifurcated the\nremedial phase\u201d from the merits phase. 274 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at\n687. Importantly, in denying Texas\u2019 motions for a stay, the\nDistrict Court took care to make abundantly clear the scope of its\norders: \u201cAlthough the [District] Court found violations [in the\ncongressional and Texas House maps], the [District] Court has not\nenjoined [their] use for any upcoming elections.\u201d App.\n134a\u2013136a.That is the end of the inquiry under our\nprecedent, as our past cases are directly on point. Like inGunnandWhitcomb, the District Court issued a ruling\non the merits against the State. Like inGunnandWhitcomb, the District Court was clear that those violations\nrequired a remedy. Like inGunnandWhitcomb, the\nDistrict Court stayed its hand and did not enter an injunction,\ninstead allowing the State an opportunity to remedy the violations.\nTherefore, like inGunnandWhitcomb, this Court\nlacks jurisdiction under \u00a71253 because there is \u201cno order of any\nkind either granting or denying an injunction\u2014interlocutory or\npermanent.\u201dGunn, 399 U.\u00a0S., at 387.[5]C1Despite this precedent, the majority\nnonetheless concludes that our intervention at this early stage is\nnot only authorized, but mandatory. None of the justifications that\nthe majority offers for deviating from our precedent is\npersuasive.The majority justifies its jurisdictional\noverreach by holding that \u00a71253 mandates appellate review in this\nCourt if a three-judge district court order \u201chas the \u2018practical\neffect\u2019 of granting or denying an injunction.\u201dAnte,at 12.\nIt reasons that the Court has \u201cpreviously made clear that where an\norder has the \u2018practical effect\u2019 of granting or denying an\ninjunction, it should be treated as such for purposes of appellate\njurisdiction.\u201dIbid.That reasoning, however, has no\napplication here. Whereas this Court has applied the \u201cpractical\neffect\u201d rule in the context of the courts of appeals\u2019 appellate\njurisdiction under 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71292(a)(1), it has never\napplied it to questions of its own mandatory appellate docket under\n\u00a71253. That explains why the only cases the majority can round up\nto support its position concern jurisdiction under \u00a71292(a)(1).Ante,at 12 (citingCarsonv.American Brands,\nInc., 450 U.\u00a0S. 79, 83\u201384 (1981), andGulfstream\nAerospace Corp.v.Mayacamas Corp., 485 U.\u00a0S. 271,\n287\u2013288 (1988)).This distinction matters a great deal. Courts of\nappeals generally have jurisdiction over direct appeals from the\ndistrict courts. See 15A C. Wright, A. Miller, & E. Cooper,\nFederal Practice and Procedure \u00a73901, p.\u00a013 (3d ed. 2005)\n(\u201cCourts of appeals jurisdiction extends to nearly every action\nthat might be taken by a district court\u201d). In contrast, exercising\nmandatory review over direct appeals in this Court is a truly\n\u201cexceptional procedure,\u201dPhillips, 312 U.\u00a0S., at 248,\nin no small part due to our \u201cnecessarily finite docket,\u201d 16B\nWright, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a74003, at 19. Reading \u00a71253\nbroadly risks transforming that exceptional procedure into a\nroutine matter, when our precedent commands a strict construction\nprecisely so that we can \u201c\u00a0\u2018keep within narrow confines our\nappellate docket.\u2019\u00a0\u201dGoldstein, 396 U.\u00a0S., at\n478.Brushing that distinction aside, the majority\ncontends that \u201cwe also construe Section 1292(a)(1)\n\u2018narrowly,\u2019\u00a0\u201d and have referred to the statutes as\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018analogous.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAnte,at 13. True, but that is no\nresponse to the jurisdictional obstacle of \u00a71253. The command from\nour precedent is not simply one to undertake the same narrow\ninterpretation as we do for \u00a71292(a)(1). Rather, our\n\u201clong-established rule\u201d requires \u201cstrict construction\u201d of \u00a71253,Stainback, 336 U.\u00a0S., at 378, so that even where the\nstatutory text could be read to expand our mandatory appellate\ndocket, this Court will not adopt that reading if a narrower\nconstruction is available,Goldstein, 396 U.\u00a0S., at\n477\u2013478. That \u201cstrict construction\u201d rule exists for a purpose\nspecific to this Court: to protect our \u201ccarefully limited appellate\njurisdiction.\u201dBoard of Regents of Univ. of Tex. Systemv.New Left Ed. Project, 404 U.\u00a0S. 541, 543 (1972). Unlike\nthe courts of appeals, which hear cases on mandatory jurisdiction\nregularly, this Court hears cases on mandatory jurisdiction only\nrarely. The majority nowhere grapples with that vital contextual\ndistinction between \u00a71253 and \u00a71292(a)(1). Nor does the majority\nacknowledge that, in interpreting \u00a71253, this Court has itself\nrecognized that distinction, noting that \u201cthis Courtabove all\nothersmust limit its review of interlocutory orders.\u201dGoldstein, 396 U.\u00a0S., at 478 (emphasis added).2Looking to escape that pitfall in its\nreasoning, the majority turns to the text of the two jurisdictional\nstatutes. But the text provides no refuge for its position. The\nmajority first states that \u201cthe relevant language in the two\nprovisions is nearly identical.\u201dAnte,at 13. But whereas\n\u00a71253 provides for appeal \u201cfrom an order granting or denying\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. an interlocutory or permanent injunction,\u201d\n\u00a71292(a)(1) provides for appeal from \u201c[i]nterlocutory orders\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. granting, continuing, modifying, refusing or\ndissolving injunctions, or refusing to dissolve or modify\ninjunctions.\u201d It is a stretch, to say the least, to characterize\nthese provisions as \u201cnearly identical.\u201dAnte,at 13.Next, the majority contends that \u00a71253 and\n\u00a71292(a)(1) are \u201ctextually interlocked,\u201dante,at 14, in\nthat \u00a71292(a)(1) provides for appeal to the courts of appeals,\n\u201cexcept where a direct review may be had in the Supreme Court.\u201d In\nits view, this demonstrates that the \u201cpractical effect\u201d rule must\napply under \u00a71253. The majority reasons that \u201cthe consequences\nwould be unfortunate and strange\u201d otherwise, imagining that an\norder from a three-judge district court that had the practical\neffect of an injunction but did not invoke \u00a71253 jurisdiction would\n\u201cappear to be appealable to one of the courts of appeals\u201d in light\nof the \u201cexcept\u201d clause, a result \u201cCongress surely did not intend\u201d\ngiven that it took \u201cpains to provide for review in this Court, and\nnot in the courts of appeals, of three-judge court orders granting\ninjunctions.\u201dAnte,at 14.This reasoning rests on a mistaken premise.\nCongress did not provide for review ofeverythree-judge\ncourt order in this Court. It provided for review of only certain\nnarrow categories of orders,i.e.,those granting or denying\nan injunction. There is nothing \u201cunfortunate\u201d or \u201cstrange\u201d about\nthe proposition that orders from a three-judge court that do not\nfall within these narrow categories of actions made directly\nappealable to this Court can be appealed only to the courts of\nappeals. In fact, this Court itself has recognized as much. See,e.g., Rockefellerv.Catholic Medical Center of Brooklyn\n& Queens, Inc., 397 U.\u00a0S. 820 (1970) (per\ncuriam) (\u201cThe judgment appealed from does not include an order\ngranting or denying an interlocutory or permanent injunction and is\ntherefore not appealable to this Court under 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a71253.\u00a0 The judgment of the District Court is vacated and the\ncase is remanded to that court so that it may enter a fresh decree\nfrom which timely appeal may be taken to the Court of Appeals\u201d\n(citation omitted)); see alsoMitchellv.Donovan,\n398 U.\u00a0S. 427, 431\u2013432 (1970) (per curiam) (concluding\nthat \u201cthis Court lacks jurisdiction of the appeal\u201d under \u00a71253 and\ndirecting \u201cthe District Court [to] enter a fresh order\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. thus affording the appellants an opportunity to\ntake a timely appeal to the Court of Appeals\u201d).[6] And to the extent a party prematurely appeals\nto the court of appeals an order that would otherwise fall within\n\u00a71253,e.g.,if Texas had appealed the August 15 and 24\norders to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, that court\nsurely will be more than capable of identifying as much and\ninstructing the party to wait for an actual injunction before\nbringing an appeal to this Court.3The majority attempts to bolster its\njurisdictional conclusion with a passing reference to the \u201cvaluable\npurpose\u201d served by the \u201cpractical effect\u201d rule,i.e.,preventing district courts from manipulating proceedings by\navoiding labeling their orders as \u201cinjunctions.\u201dAnte,at\n12\u201313. Notably, the majority cites no evidence for the proposition\nthat district courts are engaging in any kind of manipulation. Nor\nis there any indication that the District Court here attempted to\nmanipulate the proceedings by shielding its orders from appellate\nreview. Instead, the District Court carefully adhered to a common\npractice in cases implicating important state interests, staying\nits hand as to the remedy to allow the State an opportunity to act,\nas happened inGunnandWhitcomb.More important, the majority ignores the\n\u201cvaluable purposes\u201d served by the longstanding rule requiring\nstrict construction of \u00a71253. Not only does it comply with the\ncongressional command to \u201c\u00a0\u2018keep within narrow confines our\nappellate docket,\u2019\u00a0\u201d but without strict enforcement of the\nrequirement that an order grant or deny an injunction, \u201cit is\nsimply not possible to know with any certainty what the court has\ndecided.\u201dGunn, 399 U.\u00a0S., at 387\u2013388. Such clarity \u201cis\nabsolutely vital in a case where a federal court is asked to\nnullify a law duly enacted by a sovereign State.\u201dId.,at\n389. Orders coming to this Court on direct appeal under the\n\u201cpractical effect\u201d rule will more often than not lack that\nclarity.In these cases, for instance, what does the\nmajority read the \u201cpractical effect\u201d of the orders to have been\nwith respect to HD32 and HD34? The District Court held that the\nchallengers had \u201cnot proven that \u00a72 requires breaking the County\nLine Rule\u201d in the Texas Constitution, Art.\u00a0III, but that \u201c\u00a72\ncould require\u201d drawing two majority-HCVAP[7] districts. 267 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at 783, 795. Does\nthe majority read that to mean that the \u00a72 results violation could\npotentially go without a remedy? If so, there would have been no\nobstacle to use of the 2013 maps for those districts even after a\nremedial phase. Or does the majority read that to mean that the\nchallengers still had more to show before the District Court\n\u201cwould\u201d redraw the districts that \u00a72 \u201ccould\u201d require to be redrawn?\nAnd what is the effect of the conclusion respecting the County Line\nRule on the potential remedy for the intentional vote dilution\nholding as to HD32 and HD34? The majority conveniently avoids\nconfronting this lack of clarity by ignoring the relevant record,\ninstead stating without explanation that it believes \u201cit clear that\nthe District Court effectively enjoined use of these districts as\ncurrently configured.\u201dAnte,at 19, n.\u00a015. But it\ncannot escape the reality that its rule will \u201cneedlessly complicate\nappellate review,\u201dante,at 15, given that \u201cit is simply not\npossible [absent an injunction] to know with any certainty what the\ncourt has decided,\u201dGunn, 399 U.\u00a0S., at 388.I do not disagree that \u201clack of specificity in\nan injunctive order would [not] alone deprive the Court of\njurisdiction under \u00a71253.\u201dId.,at 389, n.\u00a04; see alsoante,at 16 (quotingGunn). \u201cBut the absence of any\nsemblance of effort by the District Court to comply with [the\nspecificity required of injunctive orders under the Federal Rules]\nmakes clear that the court did not think its [orders] constituted\nan order granting an injunction.\u201dGunn, 399 U.\u00a0S., at\n389. If any doubt remained as to the effect of the orders here,\nmoreover, the District Court explicitly assured the parties that,\neven though it had found violations, it was not enjoining use of\nthe 2013 maps for the upcoming elections. App. 134a\u2013136a.Finally, it is axiomatic that \u201cadministrative\nsimplicity is a major virtue in a jurisdictional statute.\u201dHertz\nCorp.v.Friend, 559 U.\u00a0S. 77, 94 (2010).\u201cComplex jurisdictional tests complicate a\ncase .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. Complex tests produce appeals and\nreversals, [and] encourage gamesmanship .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\nJudicial resources too are at stake [as] courts benefit from\nstraightforward rules under which they can readily assure\nthemselves of their power to hear a case. Simple jurisdictional\nrules also promote greater predictability.\u201dIbid.(citations\nomitted).Simple is thus the name of the game when it\ncomes to jurisdictional rules. The rule in the majority opinion is\nanything but. Although the majority claims that a mere \u201cfinding on\nliability cannot be appealed unless an injunction is granted or\ndenied,\u201dante,at 20, the rule it embraces today makes it\nhard to understand when a finding on liability would not be read,\nas the majority does here, as having the \u201cpractical effect\u201d of an\ninjunction. It is a worrisome prospect that, after today, whenever\na three-judge district court expresses that a statutory or\nconstitutional violation must be remedied, the party held liable\nwill straightaway file an appeal in this Court and assert\njurisdiction under \u00a71253, even where the district court is clear\nthat no injunction has issued.[8]The majority opinion purports to add a limit by\ndistinguishing between unappealable orders that find a plan\n\u201cunlawful long before the next scheduled election\u201d or \u201cvery close\nto the election date,\u201d and those (presumably) appealable orders\nthat are entered neither \u201clong before\u201d nor \u201cvery close\u201d to the next\nelection.Ante,at 20.[9] What does that even mean? The orders at issue here were\nentered about 15 months before the 2018 elections, and according to\nthe majority fall within the not \u201clong before\u201d but not \u201cvery close\u201d\nappealable range. Why this is so, however, the majority never says.\nWithout any definitions for its boundary posts, courts will be left\nto wonder: What about orders entered 17 or 18 months before an\nelection? Are those considered \u201clong before\u201d so they would be\nunappealable? And are orders entered 14, 13, or 12 months before\nthe election similarly unappealable because they were entered \u201cvery\nclose\u201d to the election date? And what does the majority mean by\n\u201cthe election date\u201d? Does that include primaries? What about\nregistration deadlines, or ballot-printing deadlines? It is not\nuncommon for there to be, at any given time, multiple impending\ndeadlines relating to an upcoming election. Thinking through the\nmany variations of jurisdictional disputes that will arise over the\nyears following this novel reading of \u00a71253 should be enough to\nstop the majority from rewriting our long established jurisprudence\nin this area.After today, our mandatory appellate docket will\nbe flooded by unhappy litigants in three-judge district court\ncases, demanding our review. Given the lack of predict- ability,\nthe rule will incentivize appeals and \u201cencourage gamesmanship.\u201dHertz Corp., 559 U.\u00a0S., at 94. The Court will no doubt\nregret the day it opened its courthouse doors to such\ntime-consuming and needless manipulation of its docket.DEven if the majority were correct to import\nthe \u201cpractical effect\u201d rule into the \u00a71253 context, moreover, that\nwould still not justify the Court\u2019s premature intervention in these\nappeals for at least two reasons. First, while taking fromCarsonthe \u201cpractical effect\u201d rule it likes, the majority\ngives short shrift to the second half of that case, in which the\nCourt was explicit that \u201c[u]nless a litigant can show that an\ninterlocutory order .\u00a0.\u00a0. might have a \u2018serious, perhaps\nirreparable, consequence,\u2019 and that the order can be \u2018effectually\nchallenged\u2019 only by immediate appeal, the general congressional\npolicy against piecemeal review will preclude interlocutory\nappeal.\u201d 450 U.\u00a0S., at 84. Texas has made no showing of a\n\u201cserious, perhaps irreparable consequence\u201d requiring our immediate\nintervention, nor has Texas shown that the orders could not be\n\u201ceffectually challenged\u201d after the remedial stage was completed. In\nfact, when Texas sought a stay of those orders before this Court,\nthe 2018 elections were more than a year away. For the majority,\nhowever, it is enough that the District Court found the Texas\nredistricting maps to be in violation of federal law.Ante,at 20\u201321. That cursory application ofCarson, in particular\nwhether the injunctions the majority reads into the August 15 and\n24 orders could be \u201ceffectually challenged\u201d absent immediate appeal\nto this Court, deprives that limit to our jurisdiction of much of\nits meaning when assessing Texas\u2019 request for our intervention in\nthese cases. Nothing in our precedent supports that truncated\napproach. And in any event, if Texas wanted review of the orders\nafter any injunction was entered by the District Court, it could\nhave asked this Court for an emergency stay.Second, the August 15 and 24 orders at issue\nhere sim- ply did not have the \u201cpractical effect\u201d of enjoining\nTexas\u2019 use of the 2013 maps. The majority thinks otherwise in part\nbecause the District Court noted that the violations \u201c\u00a0\u2018must\nbe remedied.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAnte,at 16. In addition, the major-\nity believes that \u201cTexas had reason to fear that if it tried to\nconduct elections under plans that the court had found to be\n\u2018racially discriminatory,\u2019 the court would infer an evil motive and\nperhaps subject the State once again to the strictures of\npreclearance under \u00a73(c) of the Voting Rights Act.\u201dAnte,at\n17\u201318. But the majority forgets that the District Court made\nexplicit that \u201c[a]lthough [it] found violations [in the 2013 maps],\n[it] ha[d] not enjoined [their] use for any upcoming elections.\u201d\nApp. 134a\u2013136a. That the District Court requested the Texas\nattorney general to advise it, within \u201cthree business days,\u201d\nwhether \u201cthe Legislature intends to take up redistricting in an\neffort to cure [the] violations,\u201d 274 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at 686; 267\nF.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at 795, does not undermine that unequivocal\nstatement. Nothing in that language indicates that the District\nCourt required the Legislature to \u201credraw both mapsimmediately\u201d or else \u201cthe court would do so itself.\u201d Brief\nfor Appellants 20 (emphasis in original). Instead, recognizing\n\u201cthat the federal judiciary functions within a system of federalism\nwhich entrusts the responsibility of legislative .\u00a0.\u00a0.\ndistricting primarily to the state legislature,\u201dWhitcomb,\n305 F.\u00a0Supp., at 1392, the District Court gave Texas an\nopportunity to involve its Legislature and asked for a simple\nstatement of intent so that the court could manage its docket\naccordingly. This request for a statement of intent, which was\nnecessary for the District Court to manage its own docket, does not\ntransform the orders into injunctions.As to the second point, if Texas had any \u201cfear\u201d\nregarding the use of its maps, despite having been explicitly told\nthat the maps were not enjoined, that would still not be enough.\nThis Court recognized inGunnthat the State in that case,\nfaced with the order declaring its statute unconstitutional, \u201cwould\nno doubt hesitate long before disregarding it.\u201d 399 U.\u00a0S., at\n390. That hesitation was not enough inGunnto magically\ntransform an order into an injunction for purposes of \u00a71253, and\nnothing about these cases justifies the majority taking out its\nwand today. Whatever \u201cfear\u201d Texas had does not transform the August\n15 and 24 orders into injunctions. And absent an injunction, this\nCourt lacks jurisdiction over these appeals. The cases should thus\nbe dismissed.IIHaving rewritten the limits of \u00a71253, the\nmajority moves to the merits. There again the Court goes astray. It\nasserts that the District Court legally erred when it purportedly\nshifted the burden of proof and \u201crequired the State to show that\nthe 2013 Legislature somehow purged the \u2018taint\u2019 that the court\nattributed to the defunct and never-used plans enacted by a prior\nlegislature in 2011.\u201dAnte,at 21. But that holding ignores\nthe substantial amount of evidence of Texas\u2019 discriminatory intent,\nand indulges Texas\u2019 warped reading of the legal analysis and\nfactual record below.[10]ABefore delving into the content of the August\n15 and 24 orders, a quick recap of the rather convoluted history of\nthese cases is useful. In 2011, the Texas Legislature redrew its\nelectoral districts. Various plaintiff groups challenged the 2011\nmaps under \u00a72 of the Voting Rights Act and the Fourteenth\nAmendment, and those lawsuits were consolidated before the\nthree-judge District Court below pursuant to 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a72284(a). Because Texas then was subject to preclearance under \u00a75\nof the Voting Rights Act, the 2011 maps did not take effect\nimmediately, and Texas filed a declaratory action in the District\nCourt for the District of Columbia to obtain preclearance.\u201cFaced with impending election deadlines and\nun-precleared plans that could not be used in the [2012] election,\n[the District] Court was faced with the \u2018unwelcome obligation\u2019 of\nimplementing interim plans so that the primaries could proceed.\u201d\n274 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at 632. In January 2012, this Court vacated\nthe first iteration of those interim maps inPerryv.Perez, 565 U.\u00a0S. 388, 394\u2013395 (2012) (per\ncuriam), finding that the District Court failed to afford\nsufficient deference to the Legislature. In February 2012, the\nDistrict Court issued more deferential interim plans, but noted\nthat its analysis had been expedited and curtailed, and that it had\nonly made preliminary conclusions that might be revised on full\nconsideration. C.\u00a0J.\u00a0S. 367a\u2013424a; H.\u00a0J.\u00a0S.\n300a\u2013315a.In August 2012, the D.\u00a0C. District Court\ndenied preclearance of the 2011 maps.Texasv.United\nStates, 887 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d 133 (2012). It concluded that the\nfederal congressional map had \u201cretrogressive effect\u201d and \u201cwas\nenacted with discriminatory intent,\u201did.,at 159, 161, and\nthat the State House map was retrogressive and that \u201cthe full\nrecord strongly suggests that the retrogressive effect\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. may not have been accidental,\u201did.,at 178.\nTexas appealed, and the case was eventually dismissed followingShelby Countyv.Holder, 570 U.\u00a0S. 529 (2013)\n(holding unconstitutional the formula used to subject States to the\npreclearance requirement).In June 2013, the Texas Governor called a\nspecial legislative session, and that same month the Legislature\nadopted the 2012 interim maps as the permanent maps for the State.\nThe Legislature made small changes to the maps, including redrawing\nthe lines in HD90, but the districts at issue in these appeals all\nremained materially unchanged from the 2011 maps.The District Court in these cases denied Texas\u2019\nmotion to dismiss the challenges to the 2011 maps, and the\nchallengers amended their complaints to assert claims respecting\nthe 2013 maps. In April and May 2017, the District Court held that\ndistricts in Texas\u2019 2011 maps violated \u00a72 and the Fourteenth\nAmendment. The August 15 and 24 orders respecting the 2013 maps\nfollowed.BThe majority believes that, in analyzing the\n2013 maps, the District Court erroneously \u201cattributed [the] same\n[discriminatory] intent [harbored by the 2011 Legislature] to the\n2013 Legislature\u201d and required the 2013 Legislature to purge that\ntaint.Ante,at 9\u201310. The District Court did no such thing.\nIt engaged in a painstaking analysis of discriminatory intent underArlington Heightsv.Metropolitan Housing Development\nCorp., 429 U.\u00a0S. 252 (1977), which is critical to\nunderstanding why, as explained in Part II\u2013D,infra, the\nDistrict Court did not improperly presume that the Legislature\nacted with discriminatory intent.UnderArlington Heights, \u201cin determining\nwhether racially discriminatory intent existed,\u201d this Court\nconsiders \u201ccircumstantial and direct evidence\u201d of: (1) the\ndiscriminatory \u201cimpact of the official action,\u201d (2) the \u201chistorical\nbackground,\u201d (3) the \u201cspecific sequence of events leading up to the\nchallenged decision,\u201d (4) departures from procedures or substance,\nand (5)\u00a0the \u201clegislative or administrative history,\u201d including\nany \u201ccontemporary statements\u201d of the lawmakers. 429 U.\u00a0S., at\n266\u2013268. Although this analysis must start from a strong\n\u201cpresumption of good faith,\u201dMillerv.Johnson, 515\nU.\u00a0S. 900, 916 (1995), a court must not overlook the relevant\nfacts. This Court reviews the \u201cfindings of fact\u201d made by the\nDistrict Court, including those respecting legislative motivations,\n\u201conly for clear error.\u201dCooperv.Harris, 581\nU.\u00a0S. ___, ___\u2013___ (2017) (slip op., at 3\u20134); see alsoAndersonv.Bessemer City, 470 U.\u00a0S. 564, 573\n(1985). The Court therefore \u201cmay not reverse just because we \u2018would\nhave decided the [matter] differently.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. A\nfinding that is \u2018plausible\u2019 in light of the full record\u2014even if\nanother is equally or more so\u2014must govern.\u201dHarris, 581\nU.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 4).The District Court followed the guidance inArlingtonHeightsvirtually to a tee, and its factual\nfindings are more than \u201cplausible\u201d in light of the record. To\nstart, there is no question as to the discriminatory impact of the\n2013 plans, as the \u201cspecific portions of the 2011 plans that [the\nDistrict Court] found to be discriminatory or unconstitutional\nracial gerrymanders continue unchanged in the 2013 plans, their\nharmful effects \u2018continu[ing] to this day.\u2019\u00a0\u201d 274\nF.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at 649 (alteration in original). Texas, more-\nover, has a long \u201chistory of discrimination\u201d against minority\nvoters.Id.,at 648, n.\u00a037. \u201cIn the last four decades,\nTexas has found itself in court every redistricting cycle, and each\ntime it has lost.\u201dTexas, 887 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d, at 161.There is also ample evidence that the 2013\nLegislature knew of the discrimination that tainted its 2011 maps.\n\u201cThe 2013 plans were enacted by a substantially similar Legislature\nwith the same leadership only two years after the original\nenactment.\u201d 274 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at 648, n.\u00a037. The\nLegislature was also well aware that \u201cthe D.\u00a0C. court\nconcluded that [its 2011] maps were tainted by evidence of\ndiscriminatory purpose,\u201d H.\u00a0J.\u00a0S. 443a, and despite the\nDistrict Court having warned of the potential that the Voting\nRights Act may require further changes to the maps, \u201cthe\nLegislature continued its steadfast refusal to consider [that]\npossibility,\u201d 274 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at 649.Turning to deliberative process\u2014on which the\nmajority is singularly focused, to the exclusion of the rest of the\nfactors analyzed in the orders below, see Part II\u2013D,infra\u2014the District Court concluded that Texas was just \u201cnot\ntruly interested in fixing any remaining discrimination in the\n[maps].\u201d 274 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at 651, n.\u00a045. Despite knowing\nof the discrimination in its 2011 maps, \u201cthe Legislature did not\nengage in a deliberative process to ensure that the 2013 plans\ncured any taint from the 2011 plans.\u201d[11]Id.,at 649. For instance, Representative\nDarby, a member of the redistricting committee, \u201ckept stating that\nhe wanted to be informed of legal deficiencies so he could fix\nthem,\u201d but \u201che did not himself seek to have the plan evaluated for\ndeficiencies and he willfully ignored those who pointed out\ndeficiencies, continuing to emphasize that he had thought \u2018from the\nstart\u2019 that the interim plans were fully legal.\u201dId.,at\n651, n.\u00a045.[12] The\nLegislature made no substantive changes to the challenged districts\nthat were the subject of the 2011 complaints, and \u201cthere is no\nindication that the Legislature looked to see whether any\ndiscriminatory taint remained in the plans.\u201dId.,at 649. In\nfact, the only substantive change that the Legislature made to the\nmaps was to addmorediscrimination in the form of a new\nracially gerrymandered HD90, as the majority concedes.Ante,at 39\u201341.The absence of a true deliberative process was\ncoupled with a troubling sequence of events leading to the\nenactment of the 2013 maps. Specifically, \u201cthe Legislature pushed\nthe redistricting bills through quickly in a special session,\u201d 274\nF.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at 649, despite months earlier having been urged\nby the Texas attorney general to take on redistricting during the\nregular session,id.,at 634; see also H.\u00a0J.\u00a0S.\n440a. By pushing the bills through a special session, the\nLegislature did not have to comply with \u201ca two-thirds rule in the\nSenate or a calendar rule in the House,\u201d 274 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at\n649, n.\u00a038, and it avoided the \u201cfull public notice and\nhearing\u201d that would have allowed \u201c\u00a0\u2018meaningful input\u2019 from all\nTexans, including the minor- ity community,\u201d H.\u00a0J.\u00a0S.\n444a. In addition, \u201cnecessary resources were not allocated to\nsupport a true deliberative process.\u201d 274 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at 649.\nFor instance, the House committee \u201cdid not have counsel when the\nsession started.\u201dIbid.,n.\u00a039.Nor can Texas credibly claim to have understood\nthe 2012 interim orders as having endorsed the legality of its maps\nso that adopting them would resolve the challengers\u2019 complaints. In\nits 2012 interim orders, \u201cthe [District] Court clearly warned that\nits preliminary conclusions .\u00a0.\u00a0. were not based on a\nfull examination of the record or the governing law and were\nsubject to revision\u201d \u201cgiven the severe time constraints\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. at the time\u201d the orders were adopted.Id.,at 650.

During the redistricting hearings, chief legislative counsel\nfor the Texas Legislative Council in 2013, Jeff Archer, advised the\nLegislature that the District Court \u201c\u00a0\u2018had not made full\ndeterminations, .\u00a0.\u00a0. had not made fact findings on every\nissue, had not thoroughly analyzed all the evidence\u2019\u00a0\u201d and had\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018made it explicitly clear that this was an interim plan to\naddress basically first impression of voting rights issues.\u2019\u00a0\u201d\n274 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at 650 (alterations in original); see also\nApp. 441a\u2013442a (testimony that interim plans were \u201cimpromptu\u201d and\n\u201cpreliminary\u201d and that the District Court \u201cdisclaimed making final\ndeterminations\u201d). Archer explained that although the Legislature\nhad \u201c\u00a0\u2018put to bed\u2019\u00a0\u201d challenges regarding \u201c\u00a0\u2018those\nissues that the [District] Court identified so far,\u2019\u00a0\u201d it had\nnot \u201c\u00a0\u2018put the rest to bed.\u2019\u00a0\u201d 274 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at\n651, n. 45; see also App. 446a\u2013447a (advising that, \u201con a realistic\nlevel,\u201d the Legislature had not \u201cremoved legal challenges\u201d and that\nadopting the interim maps \u201cin no way would inoculate the\nplans\u201d).There was substantial evidence that the 2013\nLegislature instead adopted the interim plans as part of a\n\u201cstrategy [that] involved adopting the interim maps, however\nflawed,\u201d to insulate (and thus continue to benefit from) the\ndiscriminatory taint of its 2011 maps. 274 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at\n651. Texas hoped that, by adopting the 2012 interim maps, the\nchallengers \u201cwould have no remedy, and [the Legislature] would\nmaintain the benefit of such discrimination or unconstitutional\neffects.\u201dIbid.That strategy originated with the Texas\nattorney general, who was responsible for defending the State in\nthe redistricting challenges.Id.,at 650, and n.\u00a041.\nHe advised the Legislature that adopting the interim plans was the\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018best way to avoid further intervention from federal\njudges\u2019\u00a0\u201d and to \u201c\u00a0\u2018insulate[Texas\u2019]\nredistricting plans from further legal challenge.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId.,at 650 (emphasis added); see also H.\u00a0J.\u00a0S.\n443a. The Texas attorney general also drafted the \u201clegislative fact\nfindings accompanying the plans,beforethe Legislature had\nengaged in any fact findings on the bills,\u201d stating that the 2012\ninterim plans \u201ccomplied \u2018with all federal and state constitutional\nprovisions or laws applicable to redistricting plans.\u2019\u00a0\u201d 274\nF.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at 650, n.\u00a041 (emphasis added). That the\nlegislative factfindings were predrafted by the attorney defending\nTexas in these redistricting challenges\u2014purporting to conclude that\nthe 2012 interim plans complied with the law, when in fact the\nevidence showed that the Legislature did not engage in a true\ndeliberative process or meaningfully consider evidence of the\nlegality of the plans so that it could have endorsed such\nfactfindings\u2014demonstrates that the adoption of the interim plans\nwas a mere pretext to insulate the discriminatory benefits of the\n2011 plans. That explains why legislators thought that removal of\nthose fact findings would \u201c\u00a0\u2018gu[t] the bill.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIbid.In the end, having presided over years of\nlitigation and seeing firsthand all of the evidence, the District\nCourt thought it clear that Texas\u2019 \u201cstrategy involved adopting the\ninterim maps, however flawed\u201d so that the challengers \u201cwould have\nno remedy, and [Texas] would maintain the benefit of such\ndiscrimination and unconstitutional effects.\u201dId.,at 651.\nIt is hard to imagine what a more thorough consideration of theArlington Heightsfactors in these cases would have looked\nlike. Review of the District Court\u2019s thorough inquiry leads to the\ninescapable conclusion that it did not err\u2014let alone clearly err\u2014in\nconcluding that the \u201cLegislature in 2013 intentionally furthered\nand continued the existing discrimination in the plans.\u201d 274\nF.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at 652.CIn contrast to that thoroughArlington\nHeightsinquiry, the majority engages in a cursory analysis of\nthe record to justify its conclusion that the evidence\n\u201coverwhelmingly\u201d shows that Texas acted with legitimate intent.Ante,at 28. Two critical things are conspicuously missing\nfrom its analysis: first, consideration of the actual factual\nrecord (or most of it, anyway),[13] and second, meaningful consideration of the limits of\nour review of facts on these appeals.[14]The majority first makes reference to the fact\nthat the Texas attorney general \u201cadvised the Legislature that the\nbest way to [end the redistricting litigation] was to adopt the\ninterim, court-issued plans,\u201d a position repeated by the sponsor of\nthe plans.Ante,at 26. And in its view, it was reasonable\nfor the Legislature to believe that adopting the interim plans\n\u201cmight at least reduce objections and thus simplify and expedite\nthe conclusion of the litigation.\u201dAnte,at 28. The majority\nalso states that \u201cthere is no evidence that the Legislature thought\nthat the plans were invalid.\u201dAnte,at 27. In reaching those\nfindings, however, the majority ignores all of the evidence in the\nrecord that demonstrates that the Legislature was aware of (and\nignored) the infirmities in the maps, that it knew that adopting\nthe interim plans would not resolve the litigation concerning the\ndisputed districts, and that it nevertheless moved forward with the\nbills as a strategy to \u201cinsulate\u201d the discriminatory maps from\nfurther judicial scrutiny and perpetuate the discrimination\nembedded in the 2012 interim maps. See Part II\u2013B,supra.Instead of engaging with the factual record, the\nmajority opinion sets out its own view of \u201cthe situation when the\nLegislature adopted the court-approved interim plans.\u201dAnte,at 28. Under that view, \u201cthe Legislature [had] good reason to\nbelieve that the court-approved interim plans were legally sound,\u201d\nparticularly in light of our remand instructions inPerry,\n565 U.\u00a0S. 388.Ante,at 28\u201329. The majority nowhere\nconsiders, however, the evidence regarding what the Legislatureactuallyhad before it concerning the effect of the interim\norders, including the explicit cautionary statements in the orders\nand the repeated warnings of the chief legislative counsel that the\ninterim plans were preliminary, incomplete, and impromptu.[15] See Part II\u2013B,supra.The majority finds little significance in the\nfact that the Legislature \u201c\u00a0\u2018pushed the redistricting bills\nthrough quickly in a special session,\u2019\u00a0\u201d reasoning that a\nspecial session was needed \u201cbecause the regular session had ended.\u201dAnte,at 29. That of course ignores the evidence that the\nLegislature disregarded requests by the Texas attorney general,\nmonths earlier, to take up redistricting during the regular\nsession, that proceeding through a special session permitted the\nLegislature to circumvent procedures that would have ensured full\nand adequate consideration, and that resources were not\nsufficiently allocated to permit considered review of the plans.\nSee Part II\u2013B,supra.Finally, the majority sees nothing wrong with\nthe fact that the Legislature failed \u201cto take into account the\nproblems with the 2011 plans that the D.\u00a0C. court identified\nin denying preclearance.\u201dAnte,at 30. It maintains that the\npurpose of adopting the interim plans was to \u201cfix the problems\nidentified by the D.\u00a0C. court,\u201d and reasons that the interim\nmaps did just that by modifying any problematic districts.Ibid.But of course the finding of discriminatory intent\nrested not only on what happened with particular districts. Rather,\nthe evidence suggested that discriminatory motive permeated the\nentire 2011 redistricting process, as the D.\u00a0C. court\nconsidered that \u201cTexas has found itself in court every\nredistricting cycle [in the last four decades], and each time it\nhas lost\u201d; that \u201cBlack and Hispanic members of Congress testified\nat trial that they were excluded completely from the process of\ndrafting new maps, while the preferences of Anglo members were\nfrequently solicited and honored\u201d; that the redistricting\ncommittees \u201creleased a joint congressional redistricting proposal\nfor the public to view only after the start of a special\nlegislative session, and each provided only seventy-two hours\u2019\nnotice before the sole public hearing on the proposed plan in each\ncommittee\u201d; that minority members of the Texas Legislature \u201craised\nconcerns regarding their exclusion from the drafting process and\ntheir inability to influence the plan\u201d; and that the Legislature\ndeparted from normal procedure in the \u201cfailure to release a\nredistricting proposal during the regular session, the limited time\nfor review, and the failure to provide counsel with the necessary\nelection data to evaluate [Voting Rights Act] compliance.\u201d 887\nF.\u00a0Supp. 2d, at 161. The majority also ignores the findings of\nretrogression concerning the previous version of CD25, which of\ncourse are relevant to the challengers\u2019 claims about CD27 and CD35\nin this litigation and were not addressed in the 2012 interim\nplans. See Part III\u2013A,infra. That the 2012 interim maps\naddressed some of the deficiencies identified by the D.\u00a0C.\ncourt in the preclearance litigation does not mean that the\nLegislature in 2013 was free to wholly disregard the significance\nof other evidence of discrimination that tainted its 2011 maps and\nwere entrenched in the 2012 interim maps.Even had the majority not ignored the factual\nrecord, it still would be wrong in concluding that the District\nCourt erred in finding that the 2013 Legislature acted with the\nintent to further and benefit from the discrimination in the 2011\nmaps. In light of the record before this Court, the finding of\ninvidious intent is at least more than \u201c\u00a0\u2018plausible\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nand thus \u201cmust govern.\u201dHarris,581 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 4). The majority might think that it has a \u201cbetter view of\nthe facts\u201d than the District Court did, but \u201cthe very premise of\nclear error review is that there are often \u2018two\npermissible\u2019\u2014because two \u2018plausible\u2019\u2014\u2018views of the\nevidence.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId.,at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 9\u201310).DThe majority resists the weight of all this\nevidence of invidious intent not only by disregarding most of it\nand ignoring the clear-error posture, but also by endorsing Texas\u2019\ndistorted characterizations of the intent analysis in the orders\nbelow. Specifically, the majority accepts Texas\u2019 argument that the\nDistrict Court \u201creversed the burden of proof\u201d and \u201cimposed on the\nState the obligation of proving that the 2013 Legislature had\nexperienced a true \u2018change of heart\u2019 and had \u2018engage[d] in a\ndeliberative process to ensure that the 2013 plans cured any taint\nfrom the 2011 plans.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAnte,at 23 (alteration in\noriginal). The District Court did no such thing, and only a\nselective reading of the orders below could support Texas\u2019\nposition.It is worth noting, as a preliminary matter,\nthat the majority does not question the relevance of historical\ndiscrimination in assessing present discriminatory intent. Indeed,\nthe majority leaves undisturbed the longstanding principle\nrecognized inArlington Heightsthat the \u201c\u00a0\u2018historical\nbackground\u2019 of a legislative enactment is \u2018one evidentiary source\u2019\nrelevant to the question of intent.\u201dAnte,at 22 (quotingArlington Heights, 429 U.\u00a0S., at 267). With respect to\nthese cases, the majority explicitly acknowledges that, in\nevaluating whether the 2013 Legislature acted with discriminatory\npurpose, \u201cthe intent of the 2011 Legislature .\u00a0.\u00a0. [is]\nrelevant\u201d and \u201cmust be weighed together with any other direct and\ncircumstantial evidence\u201d bearing on intent.Ante,at 26.If consideration of this \u201c\u00a0\u2018historical\nbackground\u2019\u00a0\u201d factor means anything in the context of\nassessing intent of the 2013 Legislature, it at a minimum required\nthe District Court to assess how the 2013 Legislature addressed the\nknown discrimination that motivated the drawing of the district\nlines that the Legislature was adopting, unchanged, from the 2011\nmaps. Therefore, the findings as to whether the 2013 Legislature\nengaged in a good-faith effort to address any known discrimination\nthat tainted its 2011 plans were entirely apposite, so long as the\nDistrict Court \u201cweighed [this factor] together with any other\ndirect and circumstantial evidence\u201d bearing on the intent question,\nand so long as the burden remained on the challengers to establish\ninvidious intent.Ante,at 26.The majority faults the District Court for not\nadequately engaging in that weighing and giving too \u201ccentral\u201d a\nfocus to the historical factor in its intent analysis.Ante,at 23; see alsoante,at 23\u201324, n.\u00a018. That alleged\n\u201ccentral\u201d focus, the majority contends, led the District Court to\nshift the burden of proof on the intent inquiry away from the\nchallengers, instead requiring Texas to show that the Legislature\ncured its past transgressions.Ante,at 23. Those\nconclusions can only be supported if, as Texas and the majority\nhave done, one engages in a highly selective reading of the\nDistrict Court orders.To begin, entirely absent from the majority\nopinion is any reference to the portions of the District Court\norders that unequivocally confirm its understanding that the burden\nremained on the challengers to show that the 2013 Legislature acted\nwith invidious intent. The District Court was explicit that the\nchallengers bore the burden to \u201cestablish their claim by showing\nthat the Legislature adopted the plans with a discriminatory\npurpose, maintained the district lines with a discriminatory\npurpose, or intentionally furthered preexisting intentional\ndiscrimination.\u201d 274 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at 646; see alsoid.,at 645 (discussing Circuit precedent regarding the showing needed\nfor \u201ca plaintiff [to] meet the purpose standard\u201d).[16]Even when it does look at the actual language of\nthe orders, the majority picks the few phrases that it believes\nsupport its argument, choosing to disregard the rest. For instance,\nthe majority quotes the District Court order as having required\nTexas to show that the 2013 Legislature had a \u201c\u00a0\u2018change of\nheart.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAnte,at 23 (quoting 274 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at\n649). When that sentence is read in full, however, it is evident\nthat the District Court was not imposing a \u201cduty to expiate\u201d the\nbad intent of the previous Legislature, as the majority contends,ante,at 23, but instead was describing what the weighing of\nthe direct and circumstantial evidence revealed about the\nmotivations of the 2013 Legislature: \u201cThe decision to adopt the\ninterim plans was not a change of heart concerning the validity of\n[the challengers\u2019] claims .\u00a0.\u00a0. \u2014it was a litigation\nstrategy designed to insulate the 2011 or 2013 plans from further\nchallenge, regardless of their legal infirmities.\u201d 274\nF.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at 649\u2013650.Likewise, the majority quotes the orders as\nrequiring proof that the Legislature \u201c\u00a0\u2018engage[d] in a\ndeliberative process to ensure that the 2013 plans cured any taint\nfrom the 2011 plans.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAnte,at 23 (quoting 274\nF.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at 649). But the District Court did not put the\nburden on Texas to make that affirmative showing. Instead, that\npartial quote is lifted from a sentence in which the District\nCourt, having held a trial on these factual issues, concluded that\nthe challengers had met their burden to show that \u201cthe Legislature\ndid not engage in a deliberative process,\u201d which it supported later\nin that paragraph with findings that the Legislature \u201cpushed the\nredistricting bills through quickly in a special session\u201d without\nallocating the \u201cnecessary resources .\u00a0.\u00a0. to support a\ntrue deliberative process.\u201d 274 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at 649.The majority finally asserts that the District\nCourt \u201cdrove the point home\u201d when it \u201csummarized its analysis\u201d as\nfollows: \u201c\u00a0\u2018The discriminatory taint [from the 2011 plans] was\nnot removed by the Legislature\u2019s enactment of the Court\u2019s interim\nplans, because the Legislature engaged in no deliberative process\nto remove any such taint, and in fact intended any such taint to be\nmaintained but safe from remedy.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAnte,at 23\n(quoting 274 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at 686). The majority no doubt hopes\nthat the reader will focus on the portion of the sentence in which\nthe District Court concludes that the discriminatory taint found in\nthe 2011 maps \u201c\u00a0\u2018was not removed\u2019\u00a0\u201d by the enactment of\nthe interim maps \u201c\u00a0\u2018because the Legislature engaged in no\ndeliberative process to remove any such taint.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAnte,at 23 (quoting 274 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at 686).[17] But the majority ignores the import of the\nremaining part of the sentence, in which the District Court held\nthat the Legislature \u201cin fact intended any such taint to be\nmaintained but be safe from remedy.\u201d 274 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at 652;\nsee alsoid.,at 686. The majority also conveniently leaves\nout the sentence that immediately follows: \u201cThe Legislature in 2013\nintentionally furthered and continued the existing discrimination\nin the plans.\u201dId.,at 652. When read in full and in\ncontext, it is clear that the District Court remained focused on\nthe evidence proving the intent of the 2013 Legislature to shield\nits plans from a remedy and thus further the discrimination, rather\nthan simply presuming invidious intent from the failure to remove\nthe taint, as the majority claims.In selectively reviewing the record below, the\nmajority attempts to shield itself from the otherwise unavoidable\nconclusion that the District Court did not err. If forced to\nacknowledge the true scope of the legal analysis in the orders\nbelow, the majority would find itself without support for its\ninsistence that the District Court was singu- larly focused on\nwhether the Legislature \u201cremoved\u201d past taint. And then the majority\nwould have to contend with the thorough analysis of theArlington Heightsfactors, Part II\u2013B,supra, that led\nthe District Court to conclude that the 2013 Legislature acted with\ninvidious intent.IIIThe majority fares no better in its\ndistrict-by-district analysis. In line with the theme underlying\nthe rest of its analysis, the majority opinion overlooks the\nfactual record and mischaracterizes the bulk of the analysis in the\norders below in concluding that the District Court erred in finding\na \u00a72 results violation as to CD27, HD32, and HD34. I first address\nCD27, and then turn to HD32 and HD34.A1To put in context the objections to the\nDistrict Court\u2019s conclusion regarding CD27, a brief review of the\nDistrict Court\u2019s factual findings as to that district is necessary.\nBefore 2011, CD27 was a Latino opportunity district,i.e.,a\nmajority-HCVAP district with an opportunity to elect a\nHispanic-preferred candidate. When the Legislature reconfigured the\ndistrict in 2013, it moved Nueces County, a majority-HCVAP county,\ninto a new Anglo-majority district to protect an incumbent \u201cwho was\nnot the candidate of choice of those Latino voters\u201d and likely\nwould have been \u201cousted\u201d by them absent the redistricting.\nC.\u00a0J.\u00a0S. 181a, 191a. The District Court found that the\n\u201cplacement of Nueces County Hispanics in an Anglo-majority district\nensures that the Anglo majority usually will defeat the\nminority-preferred candidate, given the racially polarized voting\nin the area.\u201dId.,at 189a\u2013190a. It also found that \u201cthe\npolitical processes are not equally open to Hispanics\u201d in Texas as\na result of its \u201chistory of official discrimination touching on the\nright of Hispanics to register, vote, and otherwise to participate\nin the democratic process [that] is well documented,\u201d and that\n\u201cLatinos bear the effects of past discrimination in areas such as\neducation and employment/income, which hinder their ability to\nparticipate effectively in the political process.\u201dId.,at\n190a\u2013191a. Given those findings, the District Court concluded that\nthe newly constituted CD27 \u201chas the effect of diluting Nueces\nCounty Hispanic voters\u2019 electoral opportunity.\u201dId.,at\n191a.Texas nevertheless contended (and maintains\nhere) that no \u00a72 results violation existed because only \u201cseven\ncompact Latino opportunity districts could be drawn in South/West\nTexas,\u201did.,at 181a, and that all seven districts already\nexisted under its maps. To explain how it counted to seven, Texas\npointed to the creation of CD35 as a supposed new Latino\nopportunity district that joined Travis County Hispanics with\nHispanics in San Antonio. The District Court agreed that only seven\nsuch districts could be drawn in the area, but rejected Texas\u2019\ninvocation of CD35 as a defense. The District Court concluded that\nbecause Travis County \u201c[did] not have Anglo bloc voting,\u201d 274\nF.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at 683, \u00a72 did not require the placement of\nTravis County Hispanics in an opportunity district,\nC.\u00a0J.\u00a0S. 176a; see alsoThornburgv.Gingles, 478 U.\u00a0S. 30, 51 (1986). The District Court\nfound that Texas had moved Travis County Hispanics from their\npre-2011 district, CD25, to the newly constituted CD35, not to\ncomply with \u00a72, but \u201cto use race as a tool for partisan goals\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. to intentionally destroy an existing district with\nsignificant minority population (both African American and\nHispanic) that consistently elected a Democrat (CD25).\u201d 274\nF.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at 683. Thus, it concluded that \u201cCD35 was an\nimpermissible racial gerrymander because race predominated in its\ncreation without furthering a compelling state interest.\u201dIbid.Importantly, the District Court concluded that,\nwithout CD35, Texas could have drawn one more Latino opportunity\ndistrict in South/West Texas that included Nueces County Hispanics.\nC.\u00a0J.\u00a0S. 181a; see alsoid.,at 190a (\u201cPlaintiffs\nhave thus shown that a district could be drawn in which Hispanics,\nincluding Nueces County Hispanics, are sufficiently numerous and\ngeographically compact to constitute a majority HCVAP\u201d);id.,at 192a (\u201cNumerous maps also demonstrated that\naccommodating the \u00a72 rights of all or most Nueces County Hispanic\nvoters would not compromise the \u00a72 rights of any other voters, and\nin fact including it substantially accommodates the \u00a72 rights of\nHispanic voters in South/West Texas\u201d). Indeed, \u201c[p]lans were\nsubmitted during the legislative session and during this litigation\nthat showed that seven compact districts could be drawn that\nincluded all or most Nueces County Hispanic voters but not Travis\nCounty voters.\u201dId.,at 181a, n.\u00a047.2Nothing in the record or the parties\u2019 briefs\nsuggests that the District Court clearly erred in these findings of\nfact, which unambiguously support its conclusion that there is a \u00a72\nresults violation with respect to CD27. Nevertheless, the majority\noffers two reasons for reversing that conclusion. First, the\nmajority contends that the District Court erred because \u201cin\nevaluating the presence of majority bloc voting in CD35,\u201d it\n\u201clooked at only one, small part of the district, the portion that\nfalls within Travis County.\u201dAnte,at 34. It cites toBethune-Hillv.Virginia State Bd. of Elections, 580\nU.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 12), an equal protection\nracial gerrymandering case, for the proposition \u201cthat redistricting\nanalysis must take place at the district level.\u201dAnte,at\n34. According to the majority, then, the District Court should have\nlooked at the existence of majority bloc voting in CD35 as a whole\nafter the 2011 redistricting.But the majority confuses the relevant inquiry,\nas well as the relevant timeline. The particular \u00a72 question here\ndoes not concern the status of Travis County Latinos in the newly\nconstituted CD35 after the 2011 redistricting. Rather, it concerns\nthe status of Travis County Latinos in the old CD25, prior to the\n2011 redistricting. That is because the challengers\u2019 \u00a72 claim\nconcerns the choices before the Legislatureat the time of the\n2011 redistricting, when it was deciding which Latinos in\nSouth/West Texas to place in the new opportunity district to be\ncreated in that area of the State. The Legislature chose to include\nTravis County Latinos in an opportunity district at the expense of\nthe Nueces County Latinos, who were instead moved into a\nmajority-Anglo district. So the question is whether, knowing that\nNueces County Latinos indisputably had a \u00a72 right, the\nLegislature\u2019s choice was nevertheless justified because the Travis\nCounty Latinos also had a \u00a72 right that needed to be accommodated.\nIn other words, did the Legislature actually create a new \u00a72\nopportunity district for persons with a \u00a72 right, or did it simply\nmove people without a \u00a72 right into a new district and just call it\nan opportunity district? To answer that question, the status of\nTravis County Latinos in 2011 is the only thing that matters, and\nthe District Court thus correctly focused its inquiry on whether\nbloc voting existed in Travis Countypriorto the 2011\nredistricting, such that Travis County Latinos could be found to\nhave a \u00a72 right. Whether the newly constituted CD35nowqualifies as a \u00a72 opportunity district\u2014an inquiry that would, as\nthe majority suggests, call for district-wide consideration\u2014is\nbeside the point.Second, the majority reasons that \u201cthe 2013\nLegislature had \u2018good reasons\u2019 to believe that [CD35] was a viable\nLatino opportunity district that satisfied theGinglesfactors.\u201dAnte,at 35. For this, the majority cites to the\nfact that the district \u201cwas based on a concept proposed by MALDEF\u201d\nand that one group of plaintiffs \u201cargued that the district [was]\nmandated by \u00a72,\u201d and vaguely suggests that, contrary to the\nDistrict Court\u2019s finding, \u201cthere is ample evidence\u201d of majority\nbloc voting in CD35.Ibid.[18]The majority forgets, yet again, that we review\nfactual findings for clear error.Harris, 581 U.\u00a0S., at\n___\u2013___ (slip op., at 3\u20134). Indeed, its analysis is too cursory\neven forde\u00a0novoreview. The majority does not\nmeaningfully engage with the full factual record below. Instead, it\nlooks only to the handful of favorable facts cited in Texas\u2019\nbriefs. Compare Brief for Appellants 46 withante,at 35.\nHad the majority considered the full record, it could only have\nfound that the District Court cited ample evidence in support of\nits conclusion that the Legislature had no basis for believing that\n\u00a72 required its drawing of CD35. In fact, the District Court noted\nthat Texas in 2011 \u201cactually asserted that CD35 is not required by\n\u00a72,\u201d C.\u00a0J.\u00a0S. 174a, n.\u00a040, that the main plan\narchitect testified that he was not sure whether \u00a72 required\ndrawing the district, and that testimony at trial showed that the\ndistrict was drawn because, on paper, it would fulfill the\nrequirement of being majority-HCVAP while providing Democrats only\none new district, and \u201cnot because all of theGinglesfactors were satisfied,\u201did.,at 178a\u2013179a, n. 45. The\nDistrict Court also concluded that \u201cthere is no evidence that any\nmember of the Legislature .\u00a0.\u00a0. had any basis in evidence\nfor believing that CD35 was required by \u00a72 other than its\nHCVAP-majority status.\u201dIbid.Had the majority properly framed the inquiry and\nap-plied the clear-error standard to the full factual record, it\ncould not convincingly dispute the existence of a \u00a72 results\nviolation as to CD27. Texas diluted the voting strength of Nueces\nCounty Latinos by transforming a minority-opportunity district into\na majority-Anglo district. The State cannot defend that result by\npointing to CD35, because its \u201ccreation of an opportunity district\nfor [Travis County Latinos] without a \u00a72 right offers no excuse for\nits failure to provide an opportunity district for [Nueces County\nLatinos] with a \u00a72 right.\u201dLeague of United Latin American\nCitizensv.Perry, 548 U.\u00a0S. 399, 430 (2006)\n(LULAC).[19]B1I turn now to HD32 and HD34. Before the 2011\nredistricting, Nueces County had within it two Latino opportunity\ndistricts and part of one Anglo-represented district. 267\nF.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at 767. Due to slower population growth reflected\nin the 2010 census, however, Nueces County was entitled to have\nwithin it only two districts. Accordingly, during the 2011\nredistricting, the Legislature opted to \u201celiminate one of the\nLatino opportunity districts .\u00a0.\u00a0. and draw two districts\nwholly within Nueces County\u2014one strongly Latino (HD34) and one a\nsafe Anglo Republican seat (HD32) to protect [an] incumbent.\u201dIbid.\u201cBased on an analysis of theGinglesrequirements and the totality of the circumstances,\u201d however, the\nDistrict Court found that the Legislature could have drawn two\ncompact minority districts in Nueces County.Id.,at 780.\nNamely, the evidence demonstrated that it was possible to draw a\nmap with \u201ctwo districts with greater than 50% HCVAP,\u201d that \u201cLatinos\nin Nueces County are highly cohesive, and that Anglos vote as a\nblock usually to defeat minority preferred candidates.\u201dId.,at 777\u2013778.The District Court then considered two proposed\nconfigurations for those districts: one with two HCVAP-majority\ndistricts located wholly within Nueces County, and another that\nrequired breaking the County Line Rule.Id.,at 777. The\nchallengers preferred the latter configuration because, according\nto their expert, \u201can exogenous election index\u201d revealed that the\ntwo HCVAP-majority districts wholly within Nueces County did \u201cnot\nperform suffi- ciently.\u201dId.,at 778. The District Court did\nnot accept that expert\u2019s assessment at face value. Instead, it\nexplained that \u201can exogenous election index alone will not\ndetermine opportunity,\u201d and so evaluated the expert testing and\nample other evidence and ultimately concluded that the challengers\nhad \u201cnot adequately demonstrated that they lack equal opportunity\nin [an alternative] configuration .\u00a0.\u00a0. such that a\ncounty line break is necessary.\u201dId.,at 778, 781. Thus,\nalthough it found that \u201ctwo HCVAP-districts could have been drawn\nthat would provide Hispanics with equal electoral opportunity, and\nthat \u00a72 could require those two districts,\u201d because \u00a72 did not\nrequire the challengers\u2019 requested remedy (i.e.,breaking\nthe County Line Rule), the District Court had to \u201cconsider whether\n\u00a72 requires a remedy\u201d and directed the challengers to \u201cconsider\ntheir preferred configuration for the remedy stage\u201d that was to\nfollow (before Texas prematurely appealed).Id.,at 783.2The majority purports to accept these factual\nfindings, and contends that they \u201cshow that [HD32 and HD34] do not\nviolate \u00a72.\u201dAnte,at 35. Specifically, the majority points\nto the fact that the challengers\u2019 \u201cown expert determined that it\nwas not possible to divide Nueces County into more than oneperformingLatino district\u201d without breaking the County Line\nRule, a remedy the District Court concluded was not required by \u00a72.Ante,at 36 (emphasis in original). \u201cSo if Texas couldnotcreate two performing districts in Nueces County and didnothave to break county lines,\u201d the majority reasons, \u201cthe\nlogical result is that Texas did not dilute the Latino vote.\u201dIbid.(emphasis in original). In its view, a districting\ndecision cannot be said to dilute the votes of minority voters \u201cif\nthe alternative to the districting decision at issue would not\nenhance the ability of minority voters to elect the candidates of\ntheir choice.\u201dIbid.At bottom, then, the majority rests its\nconclusion on one aspect of the challengers\u2019 expert evidence,i.e.,that it was not possible to place within Nueces County\nmore than one performing Latino district without breaking county\nlines. The majority acknowledges the District Court\u2019s finding that\nthe challengers had \u201c\u00a0\u2018failed to show\u2019\u00a0 that two\nmajority-Latino districts in Nueces County would not perform,\u201d but\nwaves away that finding by concluding that the District Court\n\u201ctwisted the burden of proof beyond recognition\u201d by \u201csuggest[ing]\nthat a plaintiff might succeed on its \u00a72 claim because its expert\nfailed to show that the necessary factual basis for the claim could\nnot be established.\u201dAnte,at 37. That conclusion is only\npossible because the majority closes its eyes to significant\nevidence in the record and misrepresents the District Court\u2019s\nconclusion about the potential for creating two performing\nLatino-majority districts in Nueces County.The majority, of course, is right on one thing:\nThe District Court recognized that the challengers\u2019 expert opined\nthat the two HCVAP-majority districts would not perform based on\nthe results of an exogenous election index. Seeante,at 36.\nBut the majority ignores that the District Court rejected that\nexpert\u2019s conclusion because \u201cthe results of an exogenous election\nindex alone will not determine opportunity,\u201d as \u201c[s]uch indices\noften do not mirror endogenous election performance.\u201d 267\nF.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at 778. Instead of \u201cjust relying on an exogenous\nelection index to measure opportunity,\u201d the District Court\n\u201cconduct[ed] an intensely local appraisal to determine whether real\nelectoral opportunity exists.\u201dIbid.That \u201cintensely local appraisal\u201d resulted in a\nlengthy analysis that considered, among other facts: that Texas had\na long \u201chistory of voting-related discrimination\u201d; that \u201cracially\npolarized voting exist[s] in Nueces County and its house district\nelections, the level is high, and the high degree of Anglo bloc\nvoting plays a role in the defeat of Hispanic candidates\u201d; \u201cthat\nHispanics, including in Nueces County, suffer a \u2018continuing pattern\nof disadvantage\u2019 relative to non-Hispanics\u201d; that population growth\nin the county \u201cwas [driven by] Hispanic growth\u201d and that the \u201cHCVAP\ncontinues to climb\u201d; that the districts \u201cinclude demographic\ndistributions strongly favoring Hispanic voters,\u201d and that the\n\u201cnumbers translate into a significant advantage in house district\nelections\u201d; and that data analysis showed that \u201cperformance for\nLatinos increased significantly in presidential election years,\u201d\nwhich \u201cindicates that the districts provide potential to elect.\u201dId.,at 778\u2013782.[20]The District Court\u2019s focus on the history of the\ncounty as well as its potential performance going forward was an\nimportant point of departure from the challengers\u2019 expert, who\nconsidered only the former. SeeLULAC, 548 U.\u00a0S., at\n442 (noting \u201ca significant distinction\u201d in analysis of what\ndistrict performance \u201c\u00a0\u2018had been\u2019\u00a0\u201d compared to \u201chow it\nwould operate today .\u00a0.\u00a0. given the growing Latino\npolitical power in the district\u201d). The District Court also found\nthe expert\u2019s analysis lacking in other key respects. Namely, the\nDistrict Court noted that one of the majority-HCVAP districts\n\u201cprovides opportunity, at least in presidential election years\u201d;\nthat \u201c[m]ost of the elections in [the exogenous election] index did\nnot involve aLatinoDemocrat candidate\u201d; and that the\nexpert \u201conly looked at statewide races and no county races,\u201d even\nthough it was \u201cconceiv- able that, in competitive local races with\nLatino candidates, Hispanic voters would mobilize in significantly\nhigher numbers.\u201d 267 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at 781 (emphasis in\noriginal).Based on this review of the evidence, the\nDistrict Court concluded \u201cthat Hispanics have equal opportunity in\ntwo districts drawn wholly within Nueces County (or at least [the\nchallengers] failed to show that they do not).\u201dId.,at 782.\nIt further explained that, whereas the \u201cevidence shows that two\nHCVAP-districts could have been drawn that would provide Hispanics\nwith equal electoral opportunity, .\u00a0.\u00a0. the evidence does\nnot show that the Legislature was required to break the County Line\nRule to draw what [the challengers] consider to be \u2018effective\u2019\ndistricts.\u201dId.,at 783.When read in the context of the full analysis\njust detailed, it is clear that the District Court was not\n\u201ctwist[ing] the burden of proof,\u201dante,at 37, when it\nobserved that the challengers \u201cfailed to show that\u201d the two\nHCVAP-majority districts drawn wholly within Nueces County would\nnot perform. That statement plainly refers to the challengers\u2019\nfailure to rebut the finding that the two districts wholly within\nNueces County provided equal electoral opportunity to Hispanics, as\nthey needed to do to show that \u00a72 required breaking the County Line\nRule. If anything is \u201ctwisted .\u00a0.\u00a0. beyond recognition,\u201dibid., it is the majority opinion\u2019s description of the\nDistrict Court\u2019s findings. For while relying on a reference to what\nthe challengers\u2019 expert opined, the majority wholly ignores the\nDistrict Court\u2019s lengthy discussion rejecting that opinion on the\nbasis of other evidence in the record.[21]This Court has been clear that \u201cthe ultimate\nright of \u00a72 is equality of opportunity.\u201dJohnsonv.De\nGrandy, 512 U.\u00a0S. 997, 1014, n.\u00a011 (1994). The\nDistrict Court found that two HCVAP-majority districts drawn wholly\nwithin Nueces County provided such \u201cequality of opportunity,\u201d and\nits findings of fact are not clearly erroneous. Only by selectively\nreading the factual record and ignoring the relevant analysis of\nthose facts can the majority escape the \u00a72 results violation that\nflows from those findings.IVThe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment and \u00a72 of the Voting Rights Act secure for all voters in\nour country, regardless of race, the right to equal participation\nin our political processes. Those guarantees mean little, however,\nif courts do not remain vigilant in curbing States\u2019 efforts to\nundermine the ability of minority voters to meaningfully exercise\nthat right. For although we have made progress, \u201cvoting\ndiscrimination still exists; no one doubts that.\u201dShelby\nCounty, 570 U.\u00a0S., at 536.The Court today does great damage to that right\nof equal opportunity. Not because it denies the existence of that\nright, but because it refuses its enforcement. The Court intervenes\nwhen no intervention is authorized and blinds itself to the\noverwhelming factual record below. It does all of this to allow\nTexas to use electoral maps that, in design and effect, burden the\nrights of minority voters to exercise that most precious right that\nis \u201cpreservative of all rights.\u201dYick Wov.Hopkins,\n118 U.\u00a0S. 356, 370 (1886); seeHustedv.A.

Seeante,at 2, n.\u00a01.5Contrary to what the\nmajority contends, whetherWhitcombinvolved an \u201cexceedingly\ncomplicated procedural posture\u201d has no effect on whether, at the\ntime the State first appealed, the District Court had granted or\ndenied an injunction for purposes of \u00a71253 jurisdiction.Ante,at 19, n.\u00a014. Nor was the order at issue inWhitcombless \u201cspe-cific\u201d or less \u201clikely to demand\ncompliance\u201d than the orders at issue inthese appeals.Ibid.The District Court inWhitcomb, like here, issued an order\non the merits finding the State liable and unambiguously holding\nthat a remedy was required.Chavisv.Whitcomb, 305\nF.\u00a0Supp. 1364, 1391\u20131392 (SD Ind. 1969). The District Court\ndiscussed how the Indiana Legislature might go about redistricting.Ibid.Also, the orders here were no more \u201cimmediate\u201d than\nthe order inWhitcomb.Ante,at 19, n.\u00a014. As inWhitcomb, the District Court here first attempted to defer\nto the State to redistrict, and nothing in the record suggests that\nthe court would not have allowed the Texas Legislature a reasonable\namount of time to redistrict had the State decided to take up the\ntask, as the District Court did inWhitcomb. To the extent\nthe majority relies on the 3-day deadline contained in the orders\nbelow, that deadline was solely for the Texas attorney general to\ninform the District Court whether the Legislature intended to take\nup redistricting; it was not a deadline to enact new maps. Seeinfra, at 17\u201318.Whitcombis thus not distinguishable\nin any relevant respect.6The majority opinion\nattempts to distinguishDonovanandRockefellerby\nstating that the decisions there were \u201cbased on the plain language\nof \u00a71253, which says nothing about orders granting or denying\ndeclaratory judgments.\u201dAnte,at 14\u201315, n.\u00a011. But of\ncourse, \u201cthe plain language of \u00a71253\u201d also \u201csays nothing about\u201d\nnoninjunctive orders, like the ones issued by the District Court\nbelow. Notably, the order at issue inRockefellerlooked\nsimilar to the orders on appeal here: There, the three-judge\nDistrict Court declined to enter an injunction only because \u201cthe\nstate ha[d] shown a desire to comply with applicable federal\nrequirements,\u201d but its order nevertheless clearly resolved the\nmerits against the State. SeeCatholic Medical Center of\nBrooklyn & Queens, Inc.v.Rockefeller, 305\nF.\u00a0Supp. 1268, 1271 (EDNY 1969).7\u201cHCVAP\u201d stands for\nHispanic citizen voting age population.8The majority guarantees\nthat there is \u201cno reason to fear such a flood\u201d of appeals from\nthree-judge district court orders because \u201cappeals from [orders\nexpressly enjoining redistricting plans] have not overwhelmed our\ndocket.\u201dAnte,at 20. But of course, its jurisdictional\nruling applies to all \u00a71253 cases, not just those involving\nredistricting. The majority also makes much of the fact that only\n\u201ctwo cases (GunnandWhitcomb) decided during the\npast half-century\u201d have involved the scenario at issue here,i.e.,an effort to invoke our mandatory jurisdiction to\nreview \u201ca three-judge court order holding a state statute\nunconstitutional but declining to issue an injunction.\u201dAnte,at 20, n.\u00a016. The majority never stops to\nconsider, however, that one reason so few cases have come to the\nCourt in this posture may be thatGunnandWhitcombdrew clear jurisdictional lines that litigants easily\nunderstood\u2014the same clear lines the majority erases\ntoday.9The majority believes\nthese \u201clong before\u201d and \u201cvery close\u201d limits guide district courts\u2019\ndeterminations about whether to enter an injunction.Ante,at 20. Presumably the majority would resort to the same\nindeterminate limits in determining whether, in its view, a\nnoninjunctive order had the \u201cpractical effect\u201d of an injunction\nsuch that it would be justified to accept an appeal under\n\u00a71253.10Because the Court reaches the merits\nof these appeals despite lacking jurisdiction, this dissent\naddresses that portion of the majority opinion as\nwell.11The\nmajority is correct that our reference to these findings in the\nDistrict Court orders below is \u201cnot just a single slip of the pen.\u201dAnte,at 24. That is because these findings form part\n(though not the whole) of the comprehensive analysis that led the\nDistrict Court to conclude that the 2013 Legislature acted with the\nspecific intent to further the discrimination in its 2011 maps.\nFull consideration of that analysis, as I have endeavored to do\nhere, requires review of those findings, and when read in the\ncontext of the full factual record and legal reasoning contained in\nthe orders below, it is clear that these statements do not come\nclose to suggesting what Texas and the majority read into them,i.e.,that the District Court somehow shifted the burden of\nproof to require Texas to show that it cured the taint from its\npast maps.12The\nmajority again engages in its own factfinding, without reference to\nthe fact that our review is for clear error only, when it decides\nthat the District Court was wrong in concluding that Representative\nDarby willfully ignored the deficiencies in the 2013 maps. The\nlegislative hearing that the District Court cited, see 274\nF.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at 651, n.\u00a045, shows,inter alia,that Representative Darby: told certain members of the Legislature\nthat changes to district lines would not be considered; rejected\nproposed amendments where there was disagreement among the impacted\nmembers; rejected an amendment to the legislative findings that set\nout the history underlying the 2011 maps and related court rulings;\nacknowledged that the accepted amendments did not address concerns\nof retrogression or minority opportunity to elect their preferred\ncandidates; and dismissed concerns regarding the packing and\ncracking of minority voters in,inter alia, HD32, HD34,\nHD54, and HD55, stating simply that the 2012 court had already\nrejected the challengers\u2019 claims respecting those districts but\nwithout engaging in meaningful discussion of the other legislators\u2019\nconcerns. See Joint Exh. 17.3, pp. S7\u2013S9, S11, S30\u2013S35, S39\u2013S43,\nS53. Instead of addressing what is evident from the 64-page hearing\ntranscript, the majority fixates on the single fact that\nRepresentative Darby accepted an amendment for the redrawing of the\nnew (racially gerrymandered) HD90, believing that this fact somehow\nerases or outweighs all the evidence in the record showing that\nRepresentative Darby was not interested in addressing concerns\nregarding the interim plans.Ante,at 29\u201330, and n.\u00a024.\nEven if Representative Darby was in fact responsive to minority\nconcerns regarding the composition of HD90\u2014which the record\ncontradicts, see 267 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at 791, 793\u2014that does not\nundermine the weight ofallof the evidence in the record\nregarding his intent with respect to the enactment of the 2013 maps\nas a whole.13The\nmajority contends in passing that its analysis takes account of\n\u201call the relevant evidence in the record,\u201dante,at 26, and\nn.\u00a019, apparently believing that stating it explicitly somehow\nmakes it true. It does not. The District Court orders in these\ncases are part of the public record and readers can therefore judge\nfor themselves.14The\nmajority never explains why it believes it appropriate to engage in\nwhat amounts tode\u00a0novoreview of the factual record.\nPresumably, it justifies itsde\u00a0novoreview with its\nclaim of legal error as to the finding of invidious intent. See\nPart II\u2013D,infra. But even if the majority were correct that\nthe District Court improperly shifted the burden to the State to\ndisprove invidious intent, the proper next step would have been to\nremand to the District Court for reconsideration of the facts in\nthe first instance under the correct legal standard.15The\nmajority is also just flat wrong on its characterization of the\ninterim orders. With respect to all but two of the challenged State\nHouse districts, the discussion in the interim orders states only\nin general terms that the District Court \u201cpreliminarily [found]\nthat any [\u00a72] and constitutional challenges do not have a\nlikelihood of success, and any [\u00a75] challenges are insubstantial,\u201d\nemphasizing the \u201cpreliminarily nature of [its] order.\u201d\nH.\u00a0J.\u00a0S. 303a, 307a\u2013309a. With respect to the\ncongressional districts, the District Court opined that the \u201cclaims\nare not without merit\u201d and were \u201ca close call,\u201d but ultimately\nconcluded that the challengers had not at that time demonstrated a\nlikelihood of success on the merits. C.\u00a0J.\u00a0S. 409a, 419a.\nThe District Court nevertheless emphasized that there remained\n\u201cunsettled legal issues as well as numerous factual disputes\u201d such\nthat the interim map was \u201cnot a final ruling on the merits of any\nclaims.\u201d C.\u00a0J.\u00a0S. 367a. It is a stretch to characterize\nthese interim orders as providing \u201ca careful analysis of all the\nclaims,\u201dante,at 28, and borderline disingenuous to state\nthat, despite repeated and explicit warnings that its rulings were\nnot final and subject to change, the District Court was somehow\n\u201creversing its own previous decisions\u201d when it finally did render a\nfinal decision,ante,at 28, n.\u00a022.16The\nmajority spends some time distinguishingHunterv.Underwood, 471 U.\u00a0S. 222 (1985), adamant that it does\nnot support \u201cshifting the burden\u201d as it purports the District Court\ndid below.Ante,at 22. But the District Court agreed thatHunterwas distinguishable and did not rely on it to support\nany sort of burden-shifting. As the majority explains,Hunterinvolved a state constitutional provision adopted\nwith discriminatory intent that, despite pruning over the years,\nthe State never repealed.Ante,at 22 (citing 471\nU.\u00a0S., at 229, 232\u2013233). The District Court discussed the\ndifferences betweenHunterand these cases, namely, thatHunter\u201cdid not involve a later reenactment .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nwhich is what [Texas] now claims cleanses the plans.\u201d 274\nF.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at 647. It noted the important distinction that,\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018when a plan is reenacted\u2014as opposed to merely remaining on\nthe books like the provision inHunter\u2014the state of mind of\nthe reenacting body must also be considered.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId.,at\n648. That the majority ignores that the District Court did not, as\nit suggests, rely onHunteras controlling is another\nexample of how it conveniently overlooks the District Court\u2019s\nexpress legal analysis.17Notably, the majority takes no issue\nwith that first conclusion,i.e.,that the enactment of the\ninterim plans does not, on its own, insulate the 2013 plans from\nchallenge. It explicitly notes that the opinion does not hold that\n\u201cthe 2013 [plans] are unassailable because they were previously\nadopted on an interim basis by the Texas court,\u201d noting that such a\nfactor is relevant insofar as it informs the inquiry into the\nintent of the 2013 Legislature.Ante,at 25\u201326.18The\nmajority also believes that the interim orders gave the Legislature\ncover with respect to CD35,ante,at 35, forgetting that the\nDistrict Court explicitly and repeatedly warned the parties that\nits interim orders did not resolve all factual and legal disputes\nin the cases.19It is\nworth noting that Texas\u2019 efforts to suppress the voting strength of\nminority voters in Nueces County eerily mirror the actions this\nCourt invalidated as a violation of \u00a72 inLULAC, 548\nU.\u00a0S. 399. Like inLULAC, \u201ca majority-Hispanic district\nthat would likely have elected the Hispanic-preferred candidate was\nflipped into an Anglo-majority district to protect a candidate that\nwas not preferred by the Hispanic voters.\u201d C.\u00a0J.\u00a0S. 182a;\nsee alsoLULAC, 548 U.\u00a0S., at 427\u2013429. And like inLULAC, Texas attempted to defend that curtailment of\nminority voters\u2019 rights by pointing to the creation of another\nsupposed opportunity district. 274 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at 684\u2013685;LULAC, 548 U.\u00a0S., at 429. In finding a \u00a72 results\nviolation, the Court concluded that the \u201cvote dilution of a group\nthat was beginning to .\u00a0.\u00a0. overcome prior electoral\ndiscrimination .\u00a0.\u00a0. cannot be sustained.\u201dId.,at\n442. The Court also rejected Texas\u2019 defense, holding that its\n\u201ccreation of an opportunity district for those without a \u00a72 right\noffers no excuse for its failure to provide an opportunity district\nfor those with a \u00a72 right.\u201dId.,at 430. In line withLULAC, the Court should hold that Texas has once again\ncontravened \u00a72 in its drawing of CD27.20The\nmajority contends that the District Court did not engage in a\nsufficiently local analysis because it cited to the statewide\nhistory of discrimination against minority voters, the continuing\ndisadvantage of Latino voters, and racially polarized voting.Ante,at 38. The majority not only misapprehends the\nimportance of that statewide evidence to the local appraisal, but\nagain ignores the many other factual findings and analysis that are\nspecific to Nueces County and thus problematic for its conclusion.\nSeesupra,at 44\u201345.21Contrary to what the majority\nsuggests, the District Court did not believe that \u201csimple Latino\nmajorities in Nueces County might be sufficient to create\nopportunity districts\u201d based only on \u201cbare numbers.\u201dAnte,at 37, n.\u00a027. Consistent with its rebuke of Texas elsewhere in\nthe opinion for advocating a \u201cbright-line rule that any\nHCVAP-majority district is by definition a Latino opportunity\ndistrict\u201d because it \u201cmay still lack \u2018real electoral\nopportunity,\u2019\u00a0\u201d C.\u00a0J.\u00a0S. 134a, the District Court in\nits analysis of HD32 and HD34 was clear that the challengers \u201ccould\nassert that [the] HCVAP-majority districts do not present real\nelectoral opportunity due to racially polarized voting and lower\nregistration and turnout caused by the lingering effects of\nofficial discrimination.\u201d 267 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at 781. Based on\nits review of that evidence, it concluded that the two\nmajority-HCVAP districts drawn within Nueces County provided\nminority voters equal electoral opportunity.Id.,at\n783.",
