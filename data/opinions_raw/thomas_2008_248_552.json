S. ____ (2008)SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESNO. 06-856JAMES LaRUE, PETITIONERv.DeWOLFF, BOBERG\n& ASSOCIATES, INC., et\u00a0al.on writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the fourth circuit[February 20, 2008]Justice Thomas, with whom Justice\nScalia joins, concurring in the judgment.I agree with the Court that\npetitioner alleges a cognizable claim under \u00a7502(a)(2) of the\nEmployee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), 29 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a71132(a)(2), but it is ERISA\u2019s text and not \u201cthe kind of\nharms that concerned [ERISA\u2019s] draftsmen\u201d that compels my decision.Ante, at 7. InMassachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co.v.Russell,473 U. S. 134(1985),\nthe Court held that \u00a7409 of ERISA, 29 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71109, read\ntogether with \u00a7502(a)(2), authorizes recovery only by \u201cthe plan as\nan entity,\u201d 473 U. S., at 140, and does not permit individuals to\nbring suit when they do not seek relief on behalf of the plan,id., at 139\u2013144. The majority acceptsRussell\u2019s\nfundamental holding, but reins in the Court\u2019s further suggestion inRussellthat suits under \u00a7502(a)(2) are meant to \u201cprotect\nthe entire plan,\u201d rather than \u201cthe rights of an individual\nbeneficiary.\u201dAnte, at 4\u20138; seeRussell,supra,at 142. The majority states that emphasizing the\n\u201centire plan\u201d was a sensible application of \u00a7\u00a7409 and 502(a)(2) in\nthe historical context of defined benefit plans, but that the\nsubsequent proliferation of defined contribution plans has renderedRussell\u2019s dictum inapplicable to most modern cases.Ante, at 6\u20137. In concluding that a loss suffered by a\nparticipant\u2019s defined contribution plan account because of a\nfiduciary breach \u201ccreates the kind of harms that concerned the\ndraftsmen of \u00a7409,\u201d the majority holds that \u00a7502(a)(2) authorizes\nrecovery for plan participants such as petitioner.Ante,\nat 7\u20138.Although I agree with the majority\u2019s holding,\nI write separately because my reading of \u00a7\u00a7409 and 502(a)(2) is not\ncontingent on trends in the pension plan market. Nor does it depend\non the ostensible \u201cconcerns\u201d of ERISA\u2019s drafters. Rather, my\nconclusion that petitioner has stated a cognizable claim flows from\nthe unambiguous text of \u00a7\u00a7409 and 502(a)(2) as applied to defined\ncontribution plans. Section 502(a)(2) states that \u201c[a] civil action\nmay be brought\u201d by a plan \u201cparticipant, beneficiary or fiduciary,\u201d\nor by the Secretary of Labor, to obtain \u201cappropriate relief\u201d under\n\u00a7409. 29 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71132(a)(2). Section 409(a) provides that\n\u201c[a]ny person who is a fiduciary with respect to aplan\u2026\nshall be personally liable to make good to suchplanany\nlosses to theplanresulting from each [fiduciary] breach,\nand to restore to suchplanany profits of such fiduciary\nwhich have been made through use of assets of theplanby\nthe fiduciary\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d 29 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71109(a) (emphasis\nadded).The plain text of \u00a7409(a), which uses the term\n\u201cplan\u201d five times, leaves no doubt that \u00a7502(a)(2) authorizes\nrecovery only for the plan. Likewise, Congress\u2019 repeated use of the\nword \u201cany\u201d in \u00a7409(a) clarifies that the key factor is whether the\nalleged losses can be said to be losses \u201cto the plan,\u201d not whether\nthey are otherwise of a particular nature or kind. See,e.g.,Aliv.Federal Bureau of Prisons,ante,at 4 (noting that the natural reading of \u201cany\u201d is\n\u201cone or some indiscriminately of whatever kind\u201d (internal quotation\nmarks omitted)). On their face, \u00a7\u00a7409(a) and 502(a)(2) permit\nrecovery ofallplan losses caused by a fiduciary\nbreach.The question presented here, then, is whether\nthe losses to petitioner\u2019s individual 401(k) account resulting from\nrespondents\u2019 alleged breach of their fiduciary duties were losses\n\u201cto the plan.\u201d In my view they were, because the assets allocated\nto petitioner\u2019s individual account were plan assets. ERISA requires\nthe assets of a defined contribution plan (including \u201cgains and\nlosses\u201d and legal recoveries) to be allocated for bookkeeping\npurposes to individual accounts within the plan for the beneficial\ninterest of the participants, whose benefits in turn depend on the\nallocated amounts. See 29 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71002(34) (defining a\n\u201cdefined contribution plan\u201d as a \u201cplan which provides for an\nindividual account for each participant and for benefits based\nsolely upon the amount contributed to the participant\u2019s account,\nand any income, expenses, gains and losses, and any forfeitures of\naccounts of other participants which may be allocated to such\nparticipant\u2019s account\u201d). Thus, when a defined contribution plan\nsustains losses, those losses are reflected in the balances in the\nplan accounts of the affected participants, and a recovery of those\nlosses would be allocated to one or more individual accounts.The allocation of a plan\u2019s assets to\nindividual accounts for bookkeeping purposes does not change the\nfact that all the assets in the plan remain plan assets. A defined\ncontribution plan is not merely a collection of unrelated accounts.\nRather, ERISA requires a plan\u2019s combined assets to be held in trust\nand legally owned by the plan trustees. See 29 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a71103(a) (providing that \u201call assets of an employee benefit plan\nshall be held in trust by one or more trustees\u201d). In short, the\nassets of a defined contribution plan under ERISA constitute, at\nthe very least, the sum of all the assets allocated for bookkeeping\npurposes to the participants\u2019 individual accounts. Because a\ndefined contribution plan is essentially the sum of its parts,\nlosses attributable to the account of an individual participant are\nnecessarily \u201closses to the plan\u201d for purposes of \u00a7409(a).\nAccordingly, when a participant sustains losses to his individual\naccount as a result of a fiduciary breach, the plan\u2019s aggregate\nassets are likewise diminished by the same amount, and \u00a7502(a)(2)\npermits that participant to recover such losses on behalf of the\nplan.**\u00a0Of course, a participant suing to recover\nbenefits on behalf of the plan is not entitled to monetary relief\npayable directly to him; rather, any recovery must be paid to the\nplan.",
