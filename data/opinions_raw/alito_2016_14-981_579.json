    "text": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES_________________No. 14\u2013981_________________ABIGAIL NOEL FISHER, PETITIONERv.UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN, et\u00a0al.on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the fifth circuit[June 23, 2016]Justice Alito, with whom The Chief Justice and\nJustice Thomas join, dissenting.Something strange has happened since our prior\ndecision in this case. SeeFisherv.University of Tex.\nat Austin, 570 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2013) (Fisher I). In that\ndecision, we held that strict scrutiny requires the University of\nTexas at Austin (UT or University) to show that its use of race and\nethnicity in making admissions decisions serves compelling\ninterests and that its plan is narrowly tailored to achieve those\nends. Rejecting the argument that we should defer to UT\u2019s judgment\non those matters, we made it clear that UT was obligated (1) to\nidentify the interests justifying its plan with enough specificity\nto permit a reviewing court to determine whether the requirements\nof strict scrutiny were met, and (2) to show that those\nrequirements were in fact satisfied. On remand, UT failed to do\nwhat our prior decision demanded. The University has still not\nidentified with any degree of specificity the interests that its\nuse of race and ethnicity is supposed to serve. Its primary\nargument is that merely invoking \u201cthe educational benefits of\ndiversity\u201d is sufficient and that it need not identify any metric\nthat would allow a court to determine whether its plan is needed to\nserve, or is actually serving, those interests. This is nothing\nless than theplea for deference that we emphatically rejected in\nour prior decision. Today, however, the Court inexplicably grants\nthat request.To the extent that UT has ever moved beyond a\nplea for deference and identified the relevant interests in more\nspecific terms, its efforts have been shifting, unpersuasive, and,\nat times, less than candid. When it adopted its race-based plan, UT\nsaid that the plan was needed to promote classroom diversity. See\nSupp. App. 1a, 24a\u201325a, 39a; App. 316a. It pointed to a study\nshowing that African-American, Hispanic, and Asian-American\nstudents were underrepresented in many classes. See Supp. App. 26a.\nBut UT has never shown that its race-conscious plan actually\nameliorates this situation. The University presents no evidence\nthat its admissions officers, in administering the \u201cholistic\u201d\ncomponent of its plan, make any effort to determine whether an\nAfrican-American, Hispanic, or Asian-American student is likely to\nenroll in classes in which minority students are underrepresented.\nAnd although UT\u2019s records should permit it to determine without\nmuch difficulty whether holistic admittees are any more likely than\nstudents admitted through the Top Ten Percent Law, Tex. Educ. Code\nAnn. \u00a751.803 (West Cum. Supp. 2015), to enroll in the classes\nlacking racial or ethnic diversity, UT either has not crunched\nthose numbers or has not revealed what they show. Nor has UT\nexplained why the underrepresentation of Asian-American students in\nmany classes justifies its plan, which discriminatesagainstthose students.At times, UT has claimed that its plan is needed\nto achieve a \u201ccritical mass\u201d of African-American and His-panic\nstudents, but it has never explained what this term means.\nAccording to UT, a critical mass is neither some absolute number of\nAfrican-American or Hispanic students nor the percentage of\nAfrican-Americans or Hispanics in the general population of the\nState. The term remains undefined, but UT tells us that it will let\nthe courts know when the desired end has been achieved. See App.\n314a\u2013315a. This is a plea for deference\u2014indeed, for blind\ndeference\u2014the very thing that the Court rejected inFisher\nI.UT has also claimed at times that the race-based\ncomponent of its plan is needed because the Top Ten Percent Plan\nadmitsthe wrong kindof African-American and Hispanic\nstudents, namely, students from poor families who attend schools in\nwhich the student body is predominantly African-American or\nHispanic. As UT put it in its brief inFisher I, the\nrace-based component of its admissions plan is needed to admit\n\u201c[t]he African-American or Hispanic child of successful\nprofessionals in Dallas.\u201d Brief for Respondents, O. T. 2012, No.\n11\u2013345, p.\u00a034.After making this argument in its first trip to\nthis Court, UT apparently had second thoughts, and in the latest\nround of briefing UT has attempted to disavow ever having made the\nargument. See Brief for Respondents 2 (\u201cPetitioner\u2019s argument that\nUT\u2019s interest is favoring \u2018affluent\u2019 minorities is a fabrication\u201d);\nsee alsoid., at 15. But it did, and the argument turns\naffirmative action on its head. Affirmative-action programs were\ncreated to helpdisadvantagedstudents.Although UT now disowns the argument that the\nTop Ten Percent Plan results in the admission of the wrong kind of\nAfrican-American and Hispanic students, the Fifth Circuit majority\nbought a version of that claim. As the panel majority put it, the\nTop Ten African-American and Hispanic admittees cannot match the\nholistic African-American and Hispanic admittees when it comes to\n\u201crecords of personal achievement,\u201d a \u201cvariety of perspectives\u201d and\n\u201clife experiences,\u201d and \u201cunique skills.\u201d 758 F.\u00a03d 633, 653\n(2014). All in all, according to the panel majority, the Top Ten\nPercent students cannot \u201cenrich the diversity of the student body\u201d\nin the same way as the holistic admittees.Id.,at 654. As\nJudge Garza put it in dissent, the panel majority concluded that\nthe Top Ten Percent admittees are \u201csomehow more homogenous, less\ndynamic, and more undesirably stereotypical than those admitted\nunder holistic review.\u201dId., at 669\u2013670 (Garza, J.,\ndissenting).The Fifth Circuit reached this conclusion with\nlittle direct evidence regarding the characteristics of the Top Ten\nPercent and holistic admittees. Instead, the assumption behind the\nFifth Circuit\u2019s reasoning is that most of the African-American and\nHispanic students admitted under the race-neutral component of UT\u2019s\nplan were able to rank in the top decile of their high school\nclasses only because they did not have to compete against white and\nAsian-American students. This insulting stereotype is not supported\nby the record. African-American and Hispanic students admitted\nunder the Top Ten Percent Plan receive higher college grades than\nthe African-American and Hispanic students admitted under the\nrace-conscious program. See Supp. App. 164a\u2013165a.It should not have been necessary for us to\ngrant review a second time in this case, and I have no greater\ndesire than the majority to see the case drag on. But that need not\nhappen. When UT decided to adopt its race-conscious plan, it had\nevery reason to know that its plan would have to satisfy strict\nscrutiny and that this meant that it would beits burdento\nshow that the plan was narrowly tailored to serve compelling\ninterests. UT has failed to make that showing. By all rights,\njudgment should be entered in favor of petitioner.But if the majority is determined to give UT yet\nanother chance, we should reverse and send this case back to the\nDistrict Court. What the majority has now done\u2014awarding a victory\nto UT in an opinion that fails to address the important issues in\nthe case\u2014is simply wrong.IOver the past 20 years, UT has frequently\nmodified its admissions policies, and it has generally employed\nrace and ethnicity in the most aggressive manner permitted under\ncontrolling precedent.Before 1997, race was considered directly as\npart of the general admissions process, and it was frequently a\ncontrolling factor. Admissions were based on two criteria:\n(1)\u00a0the applicant\u2019s Academic Index (AI), which was computed\nfrom standardized test scores and high school class rank, and (2)\nthe applicant\u2019s race. In 1996, the last year this race-conscious\nsystem was in place, 4.1% of enrolled freshmen were\nAfrican-American, 14.7% were Asian-American, and 14.5% were\nHispanic. Supp. App. 43a.The Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision inHopwoodv.Texas, 78 F.\u00a03d 932 (1996), prohibited UT from using\nrace in admissions. In response toHopwood, beginning with\nthe 1997 admissions cycle, UT instituted a \u201cholistic review\u201d\nprocess in which it considered an applicant\u2019s AI as well as a\nPersonal Achievement Index (PAI) that was intended, among other\nthings, to increase minority enrollment. The race-neutral PAI was a\ncomposite of scores from two essays and a personal achievement\nscore, which in turn was based on a holistic review of an\napplicant\u2019s leadership qualities, extracurricular activities,\nhonors and awards, work experience, community service, and special\ncircumstances. Special consideration was given to applicants from\npoor families, applicants from homes in which a language other than\nEnglish was customarily spoken, and applicants from single-parent\nhouseholds. Because this race-neutral plan gave a preference to\ndisadvantaged students, it had the effect of \u201cdisproportionately\u201d\nbenefiting minority candidates. 645 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d 587, 592 (WD\nTex. 2009).The Texas Legislature also responded toHopwood.In 1997, it enacted the Top Ten Percent Plan, which\nman-dated that UT admit all Texas seniors who rank in the top 10%\nof their high school classes. This facially race-neutral law served\nto equalize competition between students who live in relatively\naffluent areas with superior schools and students in poorer areas\nserved by schools offering fewer opportunities for academic\nexcellence. And by benefiting the students in the latter group,\nthis plan, like the race-neutral holistic plan already adopted by\nUT, tended to benefit African-American and Hispanic students, who\nare often trapped in inferior public schools. 758 F.\u00a03d, at\n650\u2013653.Starting in 1998, when the Top Ten Percent Plan\ntook effect, UT\u2019s holistic, race-neutral AI/PAI system continued to\nbe used to fill the seats in the entering class that were not taken\nby Top Ten Percent students. The AI/PAI system was also used to\ndetermine program placement forall incoming students, including the\nTop Ten Percent students.\u201cThe University\u2019s revised admissions process,\ncoupled with the operation of the Top Ten Percent Law, resulted in\na more racially diverse environment at the University.\u201dFisher\nI, 570 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 3). In 2000, UT\nannounced that its \u201cenrollment levels for African American and\nHispanic freshmen have returned to those of 1996, the year before\ntheHopwooddecision prohibited the consideration of race in\nadmissions policies.\u201d App. 393a; see also Supp. App. 23a\u201324a\n(pre-Hopwooddiversity levels were \u201crestored\u201d in 1999); App.\n392a\u2013393a (\u201cThe \u2018Top 10 Percent Law\u2019 is Working for Texas\u201d and \u201chas\nenabled us to diversify enrollment at UT Austin with talented\nstudents who succeed\u201d). And in 2003, UT proclaimed that it had\n\u201ceffectively compensated for the loss of affirmative action.\u201dId.,at 396a; see alsoid., at 398a (\u201cDiversity\nefforts at The University of Texas at Austin have brought a higher\nnumber of freshman minority students\u2014African Americans, Hispanics\nand Asian-Americans\u2014to the campus than were enrolled in 1996, the\nyear a court ruling ended the use of affirmative action in the\nuniversity\u2019s enrollment process\u201d). By 2004\u2014the last year under the\nholistic, race-neutral AI/PAI system\u2014UT\u2019s entering class was 4.5%\nAfrican-American, 17.9% Asian-American, and 16.9% Hispanic. Supp.\nApp. 156a. The 2004 entering class thus had a higher percentage of\nAfrican-Americans, Asian-Americans, and Hispanics than the class\nthat entered in 1996, when UT had last employed racial\npreferences.Notwithstanding these lauded results, UT leapt\nat the opportunity to reinsert race into the process. On June 23,\n2003, this Court decidedGrutterv.Bollinger, 539\nU.\u00a0S. 306 (2003) , which upheld the University of Michigan Law\nSchool\u2019s race-conscious admissions system. InGrutter, the\nCourt warned that a university contemplating the consideration of\nrace as part of its admissions process must engage in \u201cserious,\ngood faith consideration of workable race-neutral alternatives that\nwill achieve the diversity the university seeks.\u201dId., at\n339. Nevertheless,on the very day Grutter was handed down,\nUT\u2019s president announced that \u201c[t]he University of Texas at Austinwillmodify its admissions procedures\u201d in light ofGrutter, including by \u201cimplementing procedures at the\nundergraduate level that combine the benefits of the Top 10 Percent\nLaw with affirmative action programs.\u201d App. 406a\u2013407a (emphasis\nadded).[1] UT purports to have\nlater engaged in \u201calmost a year of deliberations,\u201did.,at\n482a, but there is no evidence that the reintroduction of race into\nthe admissions process was anything other than a foregone\nconclusion following the president\u2019s announcement.\u201cThe University\u2019s plan to resume race-conscious\nadmissions was given formal expression in June 2004 in an internal\ndocument entitled Proposal to Consider Race and Ethnicity in\nAdmissions\u201d (Proposal).Fisher I,supra, at ___ (slip\nop., at 4). The Proposal stated that UT needed race-conscious\nadmissions because it had not yet achieved a \u201ccritical mass of\nracial diversity.\u201d Supp. App. 25a. In support of this claim, UT\ncited two pieces of evidence. First, it noted that there were\n\u201csignificant differences between the racial and ethnic makeup of\nthe University\u2019s undergraduate population and the state\u2019s\npopulation.\u201dId.,at 24a. Second, the Proposal \u201crelied in\nsubstantial part,\u201dFisher I,supra, at ___ (slip op.,\nat 4), on a study of a subset of undergraduate classes containing\nat least five students, see Supp. App. 26a. The study showed that\namong select classes with five or more students, 52% had no\nAfrican-Americans, 16% had no Asian-Americans, and 12% had no\nHispanics.Ibid.Moreover, the study showed, only 21% of\nthese classes had two or more African-Americans, 67% had two or\nmore Asian-Americans, and 70% had two or more Hispanics. Seeibid.Based on this study, the Proposal concluded that UT\n\u201chas not reached a critical mass at the classroom level.\u201dId.,at 24a. The Proposal did not analyze the backgrounds,\nlife experiences, leadership qualities, awards, extracurricular\nactivities, community service, personal attributes, or other\ncharacteristics of the minority students who were already being\nadmitted to UT under the holistic, race-neutral process.\u201cTo implement the Proposal the University\nincluded a student\u2019s race as a component of the PAI score,\nbeginning with applicants in the fall of 2004.\u201dFisher I,\n570 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 4). \u201cThe University asks\nstudents to classify themselves from among five predefined racial\ncategories on the application.\u201dIbid.\u201cRace is not assigned\nan explicit numerical value, but it is undisputed that race is a\nmeaningful factor.\u201dIbid.UT decided to use racial\npreferences to benefit African-American and Hispanic students\nbecause it considers those groups \u201cunderrepresented minorities.\u201d\nSupp. App. 25a; see also App. 445a\u2013446a (defining \u201cunderrepresented\nminorities\u201d as \u201cHispanic[s] and African Americans\u201d). Even though\nUT\u2019s classroom study showed that more classes lacked Asian-American\nstudents than lacked Hispanic students, Supp. App. 26a, UT deemed\nAsian-Americans \u201coverrepresented\u201d based on state\ndemographics, 645 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d, at 606; see alsoibid.(\u201cIt is undisputed that UT considers African-Americans and\nHispanics to be underrepresented but does not con-sider\nAsian-Americans to be underrepresented\u201d).Although UT claims that race is but a \u201cfactor of\na factor of a factor of a factor,\u201did., at 608, UT\nacknowledges that \u201crace is the only one of [its] holistic factors\nthat appears on the cover of every application,\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg.\n54 (Oct. 10, 2012). \u201cBecause an applicant\u2019s race is identified at\nthe front of the admissions file, reviewers are aware of it\nthroughout the evaluation.\u201d 645 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d, at 597; see alsoid.,at 598 (\u201c[A] candidate\u2019s race is known throughout the\napplication process\u201d). Consideration of race therefore pervades\nevery aspect of UT\u2019s admissions process. See App. 219a (\u201cWe are\ncertainly aware of the applicant\u2019s race. It\u2019s on the front page of\nthe application that\u2019s being read [and] is used in context with\neverything else that\u2019s part of the applicant\u2019s file\u201d). This is by\ndesign, as UT considers its use of racial classifications to be a\nbenign form of \u201csocial engineering.\u201d Powers, Why Schools Still Need\nAffirmative Action, National L. J., Aug. 4, 2014, p. 22 (editorial\nby Bill Powers, President of UT from 2006\u20132015) (\u201cOpponents accuse\ndefenders of race-conscious admissions of being in favor of \u2018social\nengineering,\u2019 to which I believe we should reply, \u2018Guilty as\ncharged\u2019\u00a0\u201d).Notwithstanding the omnipresence of racial\nclassifications, UT claims that it keeps no record of how those\nclassifications affect its process. \u201cThe university doesn\u2019t keep\nany statistics on how many students are affected by the\nconsideration of race in admissions decisions,\u201d and it \u201cdoes not\nknow how many minority students are affected in a positive manner\nby the consideration of race.\u201d App. 337a. According to UT, it has\nno way of making these determinations. Seeid.,at\n320a\u2013322a. UT says that it does not tell its admissions officers\nhow much weight to give to race. See Deposition of Gary Lavergne\n43\u201345, Record in No. 1:08\u2013CV\u201300263 (WD Tex.), Doc. 94\u20139 (Lavergne\nDeposition). And because the influence of race is always\n\u201ccontextual,\u201d UT claims, it cannot provide even a single example of\nan instance in which race impacted a student\u2019s odds of admission.\nSee App. 220a (\u201cQ. Could you give me an example where race would\nhave some impact on an applicant\u2019s personal achievement score? A.\nTo be honest, not really .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. [I]t\u2019s impossible\nto say\u2014to give you an example of a particular student because it\u2019s\nall context-ual\u201d). Accordingly, UT asserts that it has no idea\nwhich students were admitted as a result of its race-conscious\nsystem and which students would have been admitted under a\nrace-neutral process. UT thus makes no effort to assess how the\nindividual characteristics of students admitted as the result of\nracial preferences differ (or do not differ) from those of students\nwho would have been admitted without them.IIUT\u2019s race-conscious admissions program cannot\nsatisfy strict scrutiny. UT says that the program furthers its\ninterest in the educational benefits of diversity, but it has\nfailed to define that interest with any clarity or to demonstrate\nthat its program is narrowly tailored to achieve that or any other\nparticular interest. By accepting UT\u2019s rationales as sufficient to\nmeet its burden, the majority licenses UT\u2019s perverse assumptions\nabout different groups of minority students\u2014the precise assumptions\nstrict scrutiny is supposed to stamp out.A\u201cThe moral imperative of racial neutrality is\nthe driving force of the Equal Protection Clause.\u201dRichmondv.J. A. Croson Co., 488 U.\u00a0S. 469, 518 (1989)\n(Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). \u201cAt\nthe heart of the Constitution\u2019s guarantee of equal protection lies\nthe simple command that the Government must treat citizens as\nindividuals, not as simply components of a racial, religious,\nsexual or national class.\u201dMillerv.Johnson, 515\nU.\u00a0S. 900, 911 (1995) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\u201cRace-based assignments embody stereotypes that treat individuals\nas the product of their race, evaluating their thoughts and\nefforts\u2014their very worth as citizens\u2014according to a criterion\nbarred to the Government by history and the Constitution.\u201dId.,at 912 (internal quotation marks omitted). Given our\nconstitutional commitment to \u201cthe doctrine of equality,\u201d\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018[d]istinctions between citizens solely because of their\nancestry are by their very nature odious to a free people.\u2019\u00a0\u201dRicev.Cayetano, 528 U.\u00a0S. 495, 517 (2000)\n(quotingHirabayashiv.United States, 320 U.\u00a0S.\n81, 100 (1943) ).\u201c[B]ecause racial characteristics so seldom\nprovide a relevant basis for disparate treatment, the Equal\nProtection Clause demands that racial classifications\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. be subjected to the most rigid scrutiny.\u201dFisher\nI, 570 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 8) (internal quotation\nmarks and citations omitted). \u201c[J]udicial review must begin from\nthe position that \u2018any official action that treats a person\ndifferently on account of his race or ethnic origin is inher-ently\nsuspect.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIbid.; see alsoGrutter, 539\nU.\u00a0S., at 388 (Kennedy, J., dissenting) (\u201c\u00a0\u2018Racial and\nethnic distinctions of any sort are inherently suspect and thus\ncall for the most exacting judicial examination\u2019\u00a0\u201d).

As a result, the narrow\ntailoring inquiry is impossible, and UT cannot satisfy strict\nscrutiny.When UT adopted its challenged policy, it\ncharacterized its compelling interest as obtaining a\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018critical mass\u2019\u00a0\u201d of underrepresented minorities.Id.,at ___ (slip op., at 1). The 2004 Proposal claimed that\n\u201c[t]he use of race-neutral policies and programs has not been\nsuccessful in achieving a critical mass of racial diversity.\u201d Supp.\nApp. 25a; seeFisherv.University of Tex. at Austin,\n631 F.\u00a03d 213, 226 (CA5 2011) (\u201c[T]he2004 Proposalexplained that UT had not yet achieved the critical mass of\nunderrepresented minority students needed to obtain the full\neducational benefits of diversity\u201d). But to this day, UT has not\nexplained in anything other than the vaguest terms what it means by\n\u201ccritical mass.\u201d In fact, UT argues that it need not identifyanyinterest more specific than \u201csecuring the educational\nbenefits of diversity.\u201d Brief for Respondents 15.UT has insisted that critical mass is not an\nabsolute number. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 39 (Oct. 10, 2012) (declaring\nthat UT is not working toward any particular number of\nAfrican-American or Hispanic students); App. 315a (confirming that\nUT has not defined critical mass as a number and has not projected\nwhen it will attain critical mass). Instead, UT prefers a\ndeliberately malleable \u201cwe\u2019ll know it when we see it\u201d notion of\ncritical mass.

In other\nwords: Trust us.This intentionally imprecise interest is\ndesigned to insulate UT\u2019s program from meaningful judicial review.\nAs Judge Garza explained:\u201c[T]o meet its narrow tailoring burden,\nthe University must explain its goal to us in some meaningful way.\nWe cannot undertake a rigorous ends-to-means narrow tailoring\nanalysis when the University will not define the ends. We cannot\ntell whether the admissions program closely \u2018fits\u2019 the University\u2019s\ngoal when it fails to objectively articulate its goal. Nor can we\ndetermine whether considering race is necessary for the University\nto achieve \u2018critical mass,\u2019 or whether there are effective\nrace-neutral alternatives, when it has not described what \u2018critical\nmass\u2019 requires.\u201d 758 F.\u00a03d, at 667 (dissenting opinion).Indeed, without knowing in reasonably specific\nterms what critical mass is or how it can be measured, a reviewing\ncourt cannot conduct the requisite \u201ccareful judicial inquiry\u201d into\nwhether the use of race was \u201c\u00a0\u2018necessary.\u2019\u00a0\u201dFisher\nI,supra, at ___ (slip op., at 10).To be sure, I agree with the majority that our\nprecedents do not require UT to pinpoint \u201can interest in enrolling\na certain number of minority students.\u201dAnte, at 11.

No. 1, 551 U.\u00a0S. 701, 735 (2007) . Because UT has\nfailed to explain \u201cwith clarity,\u201dFisher I,supra, at\n___ (slip op., at 7), why it needs a race-conscious policy and how\nit will know when its goals have been met, the narrow tailoring\nanalysis cannot be meaningfully conducted. UT therefore cannot\nsatisfy strict scrutiny.The majority acknowledges that \u201casserting an\ninterest in the educational benefits of diversity writ large is\ninsufficient,\u201d and that \u201c[a] university\u2019s goals cannot be elusory\nor amorphous\u2014they must be sufficiently measurable to permit\njudicial scrutiny of the policies adopted to reach them.\u201dAnte, at 12. According to the majority, however, UT has\narticulated the following \u201cconcrete and precise goals\u201d: \u201cthe\ndestruction of stereotypes, the promot[ion of\u00a0] cross-racial\nunderstanding, the preparation of a student body for an\nincreasingly diverse workforce and society, and the cultivat[ion\nof] a set of leaders with legitimacy in the eyes of the citizenry.\u201dIbid.(internal quotation marks omitted).These are laudable goals, but they are not\nconcrete or precise, and they offer no limiting principle for the\nuse of racial preferences. For instance, how will a court ever be\nable to determine whether stereotypes have been adequately\ndestroyed? Or whether cross-racial understanding has been\nadequately achieved? If a university can justify racial\ndiscrimination simply by having a few employees opine that racial\npreferences are necessary to accomplish these nebulous goals, seeante, at 12\u201313 (citingonlyself-serving statements\nfrom UT officials), then the narrow tailoring inquiry is\nmeaningless. Courts will be required to defer to the judgment of\nuniversity administrators, and affirmative-action policies will be\ncompletely insulated from judicial review.By accepting these amorphous goals as sufficient\nfor UT to carry its burden, the majority violates decades of\nprecedent rejecting blind deference to government officials\ndefending \u201c\u00a0\u2018inherently suspect\u2019\u00a0\u201d classifications.Miller, 515 U.\u00a0S., at 904 (citingRegents of Univ.\nof Cal.v.Bakke, 438 U.\u00a0S. 265, 291 (1978)\n(opinion of Powell, J.)); see also,e.g.,Miller,supra, at 922 (\u201cOur presumptive skepticism of all racial\nclassifications .\u00a0.\u00a0. prohibits us .\u00a0.\u00a0. from\naccepting on its face the Justice Department\u2019s conclusion\u201d\n(citation omitted));Croson, 488 U.\u00a0S., at 500 (\u201c[T]he\nmere recitation of a \u2018benign\u2019 or legitimate purpose for a racial\nclassification is entitled to little or no weight\u201d);id.,at\n501 (\u201cThe history of racial classifications in this country\nsuggests that blind judicial deference to legislative or executive\npronouncements of necessity has no place in equal protection\nanalysis\u201d). Most troublingly, the majority\u2019s uncritical deference\nto UT\u2019s self-serving claims blatantly contradicts our decision in\nthe prior iteration of this very case, in which we faulted the\nFifth Circuit for improperly \u201cdeferring to the University\u2019s good\nfaith in its use of racial classifications.\u201dFisher I, 570\nU.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 12). As we emphasized just three\nyears ago, our precedent \u201cma[kes] clear that it is for the courts,\nnot for university administrators, to ensure that\u201d an admissions\nprocess is narrowly tailored.Id., at ___ (slip op., at\n10).A court cannot ensure that an admissions process\nis narrowly tailored if it cannot pin down the goals that the\nprocess is designed to achieve. UT\u2019s vague policy goals are \u201cso\nbroad and imprecise that they cannot withstand strict scrutiny.\u201dParents Involved,supra, at 785 (Kennedy, J.,\nconcurring in part and concurring in judgment).CAlthough UT\u2019s primary argument is that it need\nnot point to any interest more specific than \u201cthe educational\nbenefits of diversity,\u201d Brief for Respondents 15, it has\u2014at various\npoints in this litigation\u2014identified four more specific goals:\ndemographic parity, classroom diversity, intraracial diversity, and\navoiding racial isolation. Neither UT nor the majority has\ndemonstrated that any of these four goals provides a sufficient\nbasis for satisfying strict scrutiny. And UT\u2019s arguments to the\ncontrary depend on a series of invidious assumptions.1First, both UT and the majority cite\ndemographic data as evidence that African-American and Hispanic\nstudents are \u201cunderrepresented\u201d at UT and that racial preferences\nare necessary to compensate for this underrepresentation. See,e.g.,Supp. App. 24a;ante, at 14. But neither UT nor\nthe majority is clear about the relationship between Texas\ndemographics and UT\u2019s interest in obtaining a critical mass.Does critical mass depend on the relative size\nof a particular group in the population of a State? For example, is\nthe critical mass of African-Americans and Hispanics in Texas,\nwhere African-Americans are about 11.8% of the population and\nHispanics are about 37.6%, different from the critical mass in\nneighboring New Mexico, where the African-American population is\nmuch smaller (about 2.1%) and the Hispanic population constitutes a\nhigher percentage of the State\u2019s total (about 46.3%)? See United\nStates Census Bureau, QuickFacts, online at\nhttps://www.census.gov/quickfacts/table/PST045215/35,48 (all\nInter-net materials as last visited June 21, 2016).UT\u2019s answer to this question has veered back and\nforth. At oral argument inFisher I, UT\u2019s lawyer indicated\nthat critical mass \u201ccould\u201d vary \u201cfrom group to group\u201d and from\n\u201cstate to state.\u201d See Tr. of Oral Arg. 40 (Oct. 10, 2012). And UT\ninitially justified its race-conscious plan at least in part on the\nground that \u201csignificant differences between the racial and ethnic\nmakeup of the University\u2019s undergraduate population and the state\u2019s\npopulation prevent the University from fully achieving its\nmission.\u201d Supp. App. 24a; see alsoid.,at 16a (\u201c[A]\ncritical mass in Texas is necessarily larger than a critical mass\nin Michigan,\u201d because \u201c[a] majority of the college-age population\nin Texas is African American or Hispanic\u201d);Fisher, 631\nF.\u00a03d, at 225\u2013226, 236 (concluding that UT\u2019s reliance on Texas\ndemographics reflects \u201cmeasured attention to the community it\nserves\u201d); Brief for Respondents in No. 11\u2013345, at\u00a041 (noting\nthat critical mass may hinge, in part, on \u201cthe communities that\nuniversities serve\u201d). UT\u2019s extensive reliance on state demographics\nis also revealed by its substantial focus on increasing the\nrepresentation of Hispanics, but not Asian-Americans, see,e.g.,645 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d, at 606; Supp. App. 25a; App.\n445a\u2013446a, because Hispanics, but not Asian-Americans, are\nunderrepre-sented at UT when compared to the demographics of the\nState.[2]On the other hand, UT\u2019s counsel asserted that\nthe critical mass for the University is \u201cnot at all\u201d dependent on\nthe demographics of Texas, and that UT\u2019s \u201cconcept [of] critical\nmass isn\u2019t tied to demographic[s].\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 40, 49 (Oct.\n10, 2012). And UT\u2019sFisher Ibrief expressly agreed that \u201ca\nuniversity cannot look to racial demographics\u2014and then work\nbackward in its admissions process to meet a target tied to such\ndemographics.\u201d Brief for Respondents in No. 11\u2013345, at\u00a031; see\nalso Brief for Respondents 26\u201327 (disclaiming any interest in\ndemographic parity).To the extent that UT is pursuing parity with\nTexas demographics, that is nothing more than \u201coutright racial\nbalancing,\u201d which this Court has time and again held \u201cpatently\nunconstitutional.\u201dFisher I, 570 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 9); seeGrutter, 539 U.\u00a0S., at 330 (\u201c[O]utright\nracial balancing .\u00a0.\u00a0. is patently unconstitutional\u201d);Freemanv.Pitts, 503 U.\u00a0S. 467, 494 (1992)\n(\u201cRacial balance is not to be achieved for its own sake\u201d);Croson, 488 U.\u00a0S., at 507 (rejecting goal of \u201coutright\nracial balancing\u201d);Bakke, 438 U.\u00a0S., at 307 (opinion\nof Powell, J.)

And as we held inFisher I, \u201c\u00a0\u2018[r]acial\nbalancing is not transformed from \u201cpatently unconstitutional\u201d to a\ncompelling state interest simply by relabeling it \u201cracial\ndiver-sity.\u201d\u00a0\u2019\u00a0\u201d 570 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 9)\n(quotingParents Involved, 551 U.\u00a0S., at 732).The record here demonstrates the pitfalls\ninherent in racial balancing. Although UT claims an interest in the\neducational benefits of diversity, it appears to have paid little\nattention to anything other than the number of minority students on\nits campus and in its classrooms. UT\u2019s 2004 Proposal illustrates\nthis approach by repeatedly citing numerical assessments of the\nracial makeup of the student body and various classes as the\njustification for adopting a race-conscious plan. See,e.g.,Supp. App. 24a\u201326a, 30a. Instead of focusing on the benefits of\ndiversity, UT seems to have resorted to a simple racial census.The majority, for its part, claims that\n\u201c[a]lthough demographics alone are by no means dispositive, they do\nhave some value as a gauge of the University\u2019s ability to enroll\nstudents who can offer underrepresented perspectives.\u201dAnte,at 14. But even if UT merely \u201cview[s] the demographic disparity as\ncause for concern,\u201d Brief for United States asAmicus Curiae29, and is seeking only to reduce\u2014rather than eliminate\u2014the\ndisparity, that undefined goal cannot be properly subjected to\nstrict scrutiny. In that case, there is simply no way for a court\nto know what specific demographic interest UT is pursuing, why a\nrace-neutral alternative could not achieve that interest, and when\nthat demographic goal would be satisfied. If a demographic\ndiscrepancy can serve as \u201ca gauge\u201d that justifies the use of racial\ndiscrimination,ante, at 14, then racial discrimination can\nbe justified on that basis until demographic parity is reached.\nThere is no logical stopping point short of patently\nunconstitutional racial balancing. Demographic disparities thus\ncannot be used to satisfy strict scrutiny here. SeeCroson,supra, at 498 (rejecting a municipality\u2019s assertion that its\nracial set-aside program was justified in light of past\ndiscrimination because that assertion had \u201c\u00a0\u2018no logical\nstopping point\u2019\u00a0\u201d and could continue until the percentage of\ngovernment contracts awarded to minorities \u201cmirrored the percentage\nof minorities in the population as a whole\u201d);Wygantv.Jackson Bd. of Ed., 476 U.\u00a0S. 267, 275 (1986)\n(plurality opinion) (rejecting the government\u2019s asserted interest\nbecause it had \u201cno logical stopping point\u201d).2The other major explanation UT offered in the\nProposal was its desire to promote classroom diversity. The\nProposal stressed that UT \u201chas not reached a critical mass at theclassroom level.\u201d Supp. App. 24a (emphasis added); see alsoid., at 1a, 25a, 39a; App. 316a. In support of this\nproposition, UT relied on a study of select classes containing five\nor more students. As noted above, the study indicated that 52% of\nthese classes had no African-Americans, 16% had no Asian-Americans,\nand 12% had no Hispanics. Supp. App. 26a. The study further\nsuggested that only 21% of these classes had two or more\nAfrican-Americans, 67% had two or more Asian-Americans, and 70% had\ntwo or more Hispanics. Seeibid.Based on this study, UT\nconcluded that it had a \u201ccompelling educational interest\u201d in\nemploying racial preferences to ensure that it did not \u201chave large\nnumbers of classes in which there are no students\u2014or only a single\nstudent\u2014of a given underrepresented race or ethnicity.\u201dId.,at 25a.UT now equivocates, disclaiming any discrete\ninterest in classroom diversity. See Brief for Respondents 26\u201327.\nInstead, UT has taken the position that the lack of classroom\ndiversity was merely a \u201cred flag that UT had not yet fully\nrealized\u201d \u201cthe constitutionally permissible educational benefits of\ndiversity.\u201d Brief for Respondents in No. 11\u2013345, at 43. But UT has\nfailed to identify the level of classroom diversity it deems\nsufficient, again making it im-possible to apply strict\nscrutiny.[3] A reviewing court\ncannot determine whether UT\u2019s race-conscious programwas necessary\nto remove the so-called \u201cred flag\u201d without understanding the\nprecise nature of that goal or know-ing when the \u201cred flag\u201d will be\nconsidered to havedisappeared.Putting aside UT\u2019s effective abandonment of its\ninterest in classroom diversity, the evidence cited in support of\nthat interest is woefully insufficient to show that UT\u2019s\nrace-conscious plan was necessary to achieve the educational\nbenefits of a diverse student body. As far as the record shows, UT\nfailed to even scratch the surface of the available data before\nreflexively resorting to racial preferences. For instance, because\nUT knows which students were admitted through the Top Ten Percent\nPlan and which were not, as well as which students enrolled in\nwhich classes, it would seem relatively easy to determine whether\nTop Ten Percent students were more or less likely than holistic\nadmittees to enroll in the types of classes where diversity was\nlacking. But UT never bothered to figure this out. Seeante,\nat 9 (acknowledging that UT submitted no evidence regarding \u201chow\nstudents admitted solely based on their class rank differ in their\ncontribution to diversity from students admitted through holistic\nreview\u201d). Nor is there any indication that UT instructed admissions\nofficers to search for African-American and Hispanic applicants who\nwould fill particular gaps at the classroom level. Given UT\u2019s\nfailure to present such evidence, it has not demonstrated that its\nrace-conscious policy would promote classroom diversity any better\nthan race-neutral options, such as expanding the Top Ten Percent\nPlan or using race-neutral holistic admissions.Moreover, if UT is truly seeking to expose its\nstudents to a diversity of ideas and perspectives, its policy is\npoorly tailored to serve that end. UT\u2019s own study\u2014which the\nmajority touts as the best \u201cnuanced quantitative data\u201d supporting\nUT\u2019s position,ante, at 15\u2014demonstrated that classroom\ndiversity was more lacking for students classified as\nAsian-American than for those classified as Hispanic. Supp. App.\n26a. But the UT plan discriminatesagainstAsian-American\nstudents.[4] UT is apparently\nunconcerned that Asian-Americans \u201cmay be made to feel isolated or\nmay be seen as .\u00a0.\u00a0. \u2018spokesperson[s]\u2019 of their race or\nethnicity.\u201dId.,at 69a; seeid., at 25a. And unless\nthe University is engaged in unconstitutional racial balancing\nbased on Texas demographics (where Hispanics outnumber\nAsian-Americans), see Part II\u2013C\u20131,supra, it seemingly views\nthe classroom contributions of Asian-American students as less\nvaluable than those of Hispanic students. In UT\u2019s view, apparently,\n\u201cAsian Americans are not worth as much as Hispanics in promoting\n\u2018cross-racial understanding,\u2019 breaking down \u2018racial stereotypes,\u2019\nand enabling students to \u2018better understand persons of different\nraces.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Brief for Asian American Legal Foundation\net\u00a0al. asAmici Curiae11 (representing 117\nAsian-American organizations). The majority opinion effectively\nendorses this view, crediting UT\u2019s reliance on the classroom study\nas proof that the University assessed its need for racial\ndiscrimination (including racial discrimination that undeniably\nharms Asian-Americans) \u201cwith care.\u201dAnte, at 15.While both the majority and the Fifth Circuit\nrely on UT\u2019s classroom study, seeante, at 15; 758 F. 3d, at\n658\u2013659, they completely ignore its finding that Hispanics are\nbetter represented than Asian-Americans in UT classrooms. In fact,\nthey act almost as if Asian-American students do not exist. Seeante, at 14 (mentioning Asian-Americans only a single time\noutside of parentheticals, and not in the context of the classroom\nstudy); 758 F. 3d, at 658 (mentioning Asian-Americans only a single\ntime).[5] Only the District\nCourt acknowledged the impact of UT\u2019s policy on Asian-American\nstudents. But it brushed aside this impact,\nconcluding\u2014astoundingly\u2014that UT can pick and choose which racial\nand ethnic groups it would like to favor. According to the District\nCourt, \u201cnothing inGrutterrequires a university to give\nequal preference to every minority group,\u201d and UT is allowed \u201cto\nexercise its discretion in determining which minority groups should\nbenefit from the consideration of race.\u201d 645 F.

UT has no good answer. And UT makes no effort to\nensure that it has a critical mass of, say, \u201cFilipino Americans\u201d or\n\u201cCambodian Americans.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 52 (Oct. 10, 2012). As long\nas there are a sufficient number of \u201cAsian Americans,\u201d UT is\napparently satisfied.UT\u2019s failure to provide any definition of the\nvarious racial and ethnic groups is also revealing. UT does not\nspecify what it means to be \u201cAfrican-American,\u201d \u201cHis-panic,\u201d \u201cAsian\nAmerican,\u201d \u201cNative American,\u201d or \u201cWhite.\u201d Supp. App. 30a. And UT\nevidently labels each student as falling into only a single racial\nor ethnic group, see,e.g.,id.,at 10a\u201313a, 30a,\n43a\u201344a, 71a, 156a\u2013157a, 169a\u2013170a, without explaining how\nindividuals with ancestors from different groups are to be\ncharacterized. As racial and ethnic prejudice recedes, more and\nmore students will have parents (or grandparents) who fall into\nmore than one of UT\u2019s five groups. According to census figures,\nindividuals describing themselves as members of multiple races grew\nby 32% from 2000 to 2010.[7] A\nrecent survey reported that 26% of Hispanics and 28% of\nAsian-Americans marry a spouse of a different race or\nethnicity.[8] UT\u2019s crude\nclassification system is ill suited for the more integrated country\nthat we are rapidly becoming. UT assumes that if an applicant\ndescribes himself or herself as a member of a particular race or\nethnicity, that applicant will have a perspective that differs from\nthat of applicants who describe themselves as members of different\ngroups. But is this necessarily so? If an applicant hasone\ngrandparent, great-grandparent, or great-great-grandparent who was\na member of a favored group, is that enough to permit UT to infer\nthat this student\u2019s classroom contribution will reflect a\ndistinctive perspective or set of experiences associated with that\ngroup? UT does not say. It instead relies on applicants to\n\u201cclassify themselves.\u201dFisher I, 570 U.\u00a0S., at ___\n(slip op., at 4). This is an invitation for applicants to game the\nsystem.Finally, it seems clear that the lack of\nclassroom diver-sity is attributable in good part to factors other\nthan the representation of the favored groups in the UT student\npopulation. UT offers an enormous number of classes in a wide range\nof subjects, and it gives undergraduates a very large measure of\nfreedom to choose their classes. UT also offers courses in subjects\nthat are likely to have special appeal to members of the minority\ngroups given preferential treatment under its challenged plan, and\nthis of course diminishes the number of other courses in which\nthese students can enroll. See,e.g.,Supp. App. 72a\u201373a\n(indicating that the representation of African-Americans and\nHispanics in UT classrooms varies substantially from major to\nmajor). Having designed an undergraduate program that virtually\nensures a lack of classroom diver-sity, UT is poorly positioned to\nargue that this very result provides a justification for racial and\nethnic discrimination, which the Constitution rarely allows.3UT\u2019s purported interest in intraracial\ndiversity, or \u201cdiversity within diversity,\u201d Brief for Respondents\n34, also falls short. At bottom, this argument relies on the\nunsupported assumption that there is something deficient or at\nleast radically different about the African-American and Hispanic\nstudents admitted through the Top Ten Percent Plan.Throughout this litigation, UT has repeatedly\nshifted its position on the need for intraracial diversity.\nInitially, in the 2004 Proposal, UT did not rely on this alleged\nneed at all. Rather, the Proposal \u201cexamined two metrics\u2014classroom\ndiversity and demographic disparities\u2014that it concluded were\nrelevant to its ability to provide [the] benefits of diversity.\u201d\nBrief for United States asAmicus Curiae27\u201328. Those\nmetrics looked only to the numbers of African-Americans and\nHispanics, not to diversity within each group.On appeal to the Fifth Circuit and inFisher\nI, however, UT began to emphasize its intraracial diversity\nargument. UT complained that the Top Ten Percent Law hinders its\nefforts to assemble a broadly diverse class because the minorities\nadmitted under that law are drawn largely from certain areas of\nTexas where there are majority-minority schools. These students, UT\nargued, tend to come from poor, disadvantaged families, and the\nUniver-sity would prefer a system that gives it substantial leeway\nto seek broad diversitywithingroups of underrepresented\nminorities. In particular, UT asserted a need for more\nAfrican-American and Hispanic students from privileged backgrounds.\nSee,e.g.,Brief for Respondents in No. 11\u2013345, at 34\n(explaining that UT needs race-conscious admissions in order to\nadmit \u201c[t]he African-American or Hispanic child of successful\nprofessionals in Dallas\u201d);ibid.(claiming that privileged\nminorities \u201chave great potential for serving as a \u2018bridge\u2019 in\npromoting cross-racial understanding, as well as in breaking down\nracial stereotypes\u201d);ibid.(intimating that the\nunderprivileged minority students admitted under the Top Ten\nPercent Plan \u201creinforc[e]\u201d \u201cstereotypical assumptions\u201d); Tr.\nof Oral Arg. 43\u201345 (Oct. 10, 2012) (\u201c[A]lthough the percentage plan\ncertainly helps with minority admissions, by and large, the\u2014the\nminorities who are admitted tend to come from seg-regated,\nracially-identifiable schools,\u201d and \u201cwe wantminorities from\ndifferent backgrounds\u201d). Thus, the Top Ten Percent Law is faulted\nfor admittingthe wrong kind of African-American and Hispanic\nstudents.The Fifth Circuit embraced this argument on\nremand, endorsing UT\u2019s claimed need to enroll minorities from\n\u201chigh-performing,\u201d \u201cmajority-white\u201d high schools. 758 F.\u00a03d,\nat 653. According to the Fifth Circuit, these more privileged\nminorities \u201cbring a perspective not captured by\u201d students admitted\nunder the Top Ten Percent Law, who often come \u201cfrom highly\nsegregated, underfunded, and underperforming schools.\u201dIbid.For instance, the court determined, privileged minorities \u201ccan\nenrich the diversity of the student body in distinct ways\u201d because\nsuch students have \u201chigher levels of preparation and better\nprospects for admission to UT Austin\u2019s more demanding colleges\u201d\nthan underprivileged minorities.Id.,at 654; see alsoFisher, 631 F.\u00a03d, at 240, n. 149 (concluding thatthe\nTop Ten Percent Plan \u201cwidens the \u2018credentials gap\u2019 between minority\nand non-minority students at the University, which risks driving\naway matriculating minor-ity students from difficult majors like\nbusiness or the sciences\u201d).Remarkably, UT now contends that petitioner has\n\u201cfabricat[ed]\u201d the argument that it is seeking affluent minorities.\nBrief for Respondents 2. That claim is impossible to square with\nUT\u2019s prior statements to this Court in the briefing and oral\nargument inFisher I.[9]\nMoreover, although UT reframes its argument, it continues to assert\nthat it needs affirmative action to admit privileged minorities.\nFor instance, UT\u2019s brief highlights its interest in admitting\n\u201c[t]he black student with high grades from Andover.\u201d Brief for\nRespondents 33. Similarly, at oral argument, UT claimed that its\n\u201cinterests in the educa-tional benefits of diversity would not be\nmet if all of [the] minority students were .\u00a0.\u00a0. coming\nfrom depressed socioeconomic backgrounds.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 53\n(Dec. 9, 2015); see alsoid.,at 43, 45.Ultimately, UT\u2019s intraracial diversity rationale\nrelies on the baseless assumption that there is something wrong\nwith African-American and Hispanic students admitted through the\nTop Ten Percent Plan, because they are \u201cfrom the lower-performing,\nracially identifiable schools.\u201dId.,at 43; seeid.,at 42\u201343 (explaining that \u201cthe basis\u201d for UT\u2019s conclusion that it\nwas \u201cnot getting a variety of perspectives among African-Americans\nor Hispanics\u201d was the fact that the Top Ten Percent Plan admits\nunderprivileged minorities from highly segregated schools). In\neffect, UT asks the Court \u201ctoassume\u201d\u2014without any\nevidence\u2014\u201cthat minorities admitted under the Top Ten Percent Law\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. are somehow more homogenous, less dynamic, and more\nundesirably stereotypical than those admitted under holistic\nreview.\u201d 758 F.\u00a03d, at 669\u2013670 (Garza, J., dissenting). And\nUT\u2019s assumptions appear to be based on the pernicious stereotype\nthat the African-Americans and Hispanics admitted through the Top\nTen Percent Plan only got in because they did not have to compete\nagainst very many whites and Asian-Americans. See Tr. of Oral Arg.\n42\u201343 (Dec. 9, 2015). These are \u201cthe very stereotypical assumptions\n[that] the Equal Protection Clause forbids.\u201dMiller, 515\nU.\u00a0S., at 914. UT cannot satisfy its burden by attempting to\n\u201csubstitute racial stereotype for evidence, and racial prejudice\nfor reason.\u201dCalhounv.United States, 568 U.\u00a0S.\n___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 4) (Sotomayor, J., respecting denial\nof certiorari).In addition to relying on stereotypes, UT\u2019s\nargument that it needs racial preferences to admit privileged\nminorities turns the concept of affirmative action on its head.\nWhen affirmative action programs were first adopted, it was for the\npurpose of helping the disadvantaged. See,e.g., Bakke, 438\nU.\u00a0S., at 272\u2013275 (opinion of Powell, J.) (explaining that the\nschool\u2019s affirmative action program was designed \u201cto increase the\nrepresentation\u201d of \u201c\u00a0\u2018economically and/or educationally\ndisadvantaged\u2019\u00a0 applicants\u201d). Now we are told that a program\nthat tends to admit poor and disadvantaged minority students is\ninadequate because it does not work to the advantage of those who\nare more fortunate. This is affirmative action gone wild.It is also far from clear that UT\u2019s assumptions\nabout the socioeconomic status of minorities admitted through the\nTop Ten Percent Plan are even remotely accurate. Take, for example,\nparental education. In 2008, when petitioner applied to UT,\napproximately 79% of Texans aged 25 years or older had a high\nschool diploma, 17% had a bachelor\u2019s degree, and 8% had a graduate\nor professional degree. Dept. of Educ., Nat. Center for Educ.\nStatistics, T. Snyder & S. Dillow,Digest of Education\nStatistics 2010, p.\u00a029 (2011). In contrast, 96% of\nAfrican-Americans admitted through the Top Ten Percent Plan had a\nparent with a high school diploma, 59% had a parent with a\nbachelor\u2019s degree, and 26% had a parent with a graduate or\nprofessional degree. See UT, Office of Admissions, Student Profile,\nAdmitted Freshman Class of 2008, p.\u00a08 (rev. Aug. 1,2012) (2008\nStudent Profile), online at\nhttps://uteas.app.box.\u00a0com\u00a0/\u00a0s\u00a0/twqozsbm2vb9lhm14o0v0czvqs1ygzqr/1/7732448553/23476747441/1.\nSimilarly, 83% of Hispanics admitted through the Top Ten Percent\nPlan had a parent with a high school diploma, 42% had a parent with\na bachelor\u2019s degree, and 21% had a parent with a graduate or\nprofessional degree.Ibid.As these statistics make plain,\nthe minorities that UT characterizes as \u201ccoming from depressed\nsocioeconomic backgrounds,\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 53 (Dec. 9, 2015),\ngenerally come from households with education levels exceeding the\nnorm in Texas.Or consider income levels. In 2008, the median\nannual household income in Texas was $49,453. United States Census\nBureau, A. Noss, Household Income for States: 2008 and 2009,\np.\u00a04 (2010), online at\nhttps://www.census.gov/prod/2010pubs/acsbr09-2.pdf. The household\nincome levels for Top Ten Percent African-American and Hispanic\nadmittees were on par: Roughly half of such admittees came from\nhouseholds below the Texas median, and half came from households\nabove the median. See 2008 Student Profile 6. And a large portion\nof these admittees are from households with income levels far\nexceeding the Texas median. Specifically, 25% of African-Americans\nand 27% of Hispanics admitted through the Top Ten Percent Plan in\n2008 were raised in households with incomes exceeding $80,000.Ibid.In light of this evidence, UT\u2019s actual argument is not\nthat it needs affirmative action to ensure that its minority\nadmittees are representative of the State of Texas. Rather, UT is\nasserting that it needs affirmative action to ensure that its\nminority students disproportionally come from families that are\nwealthier and better educated than the average Texas family.In addition to using socioeconomic status to\nfalsely denigrate the minority students admitted through the Top\nTen Percent Plan, UT also argues that such students are\nacademically inferior. See,e.g.,Brief for Respondents in\nNo. 11\u2013345, at 33 (\u201c[T]he top 10% law systematically hinders UT\u2019s\nefforts to assemble a class that is .\u00a0.\u00a0. academically\nexcellent\u201d). \u201cOn average,\u201d UT claims, \u201cAfrican-American and\nHispanic holistic admits have higher SAT scores than their Top 10%\ncounterparts.\u201d Brief for Respondents 43, n.\u00a08. As a result, UT\nargues that it needs race-conscious admissions to enroll\nacademically superior minority students with higher SAT scores.\nRegrettably, the majority seems to embrace this argument as well.\nSeeante,at 16 (\u201c[T]he Equal Protection Clause does not\nforce universities to choose between a diverse student body and a\nreputation for academic excellence\u201d).This argument fails for a number of reasons.\nFirst, it is simply not true that Top Ten Percent minority\nadmittees are academically inferior to holistic admittees. In fact,\nas UT\u2019s president explained in 2000, \u201ctop 10 percent high school\nstudents make much higher grades in college than non-top 10 percent\nstudents,\u201d and \u201c[s]trong academic performance in high school is an\neven better predictor of success in college than standardized test\nscores.\u201d App. 393a\u2013394a; see also Lavergne Deposition 41\u201342\n(agreeing that \u201cit\u2019s generally true that students admitted pursuant\nto HB 588 [the Top Ten Percent Law] have a higher level of academic\nperformance at the University than students admitted outside of HB\n588\u201d). Indeed, the statistics in the record reveal that, for each\nyear between 2003 and 2007, African-American in-state freshmen who\nwere admitted under the Top Ten Percent Law earned a higher mean\ngrade point average than those admitted outside of the Top Ten\nPercent Law. Supp. App. 164a. The same is true for Hispanic\nstudents.Id.,at 165a. These conclusions correspond to the\nresults of nationwide studies showing that high school grades are a\nbetter predictor of success in college than SAT scores.[10]It is also more than a little ironic that UT\nuses the SAT, which has often been accused of reflecting racial and\ncultural bias,[11] as a\nreason for dissatisfaction with poor and disadvantaged\nAfrican-American and Hispanic students who excel both in high\nschool and in college. Even if the SAT does not reflect such bias\n(and I am ill equipped to express a view on that subject), SAT\nscores clearly correlate with wealth.[12]UT certainly has a compelling interest in\nadmitting students who will achieve academic success, but it does\nnot follow that it has a compelling interest in maximizing\nadmittees\u2019 SAT scores. Approximately 850 4-year-degree institutions\ndo not require the SAT or ACT as part of the admissions process.\nSee J. Soares, SAT Wars: The Case for Test-Optional College\nAdmissions 2 (2012). This includes many excellent schools.[13]To the extent that intraracial diversity refers\nto something other than admitting privileged minorities and\nminorities with higher SAT scores, UT has failed to define that\ninterest with any clarity. UT \u201chas not provided any concrete\ntargets for admitting more minority students possessing [the]\nunique qualitative-diversity characteristics\u201d it desires. 758\nF.\u00a03d, at 669 (Garza, J., dissenting). Nor has UT specified\nwhich characteristics, viewpoints, and life experiences are\nsupposedly lacking in the African-Americans and Hispanics admitted\nthrough the Top Ten Percent Plan. In fact, because UT\nadministrators make no collective, qualitative assessment of the\nminorities admitted automatically, they have no way of knowing\nwhich attributes are missing. Seeante,at 9 (admitting that\nthere is no way of knowing \u201chow students admitted solely based on\ntheir class rank differ in their contribution to diversity from\nstudents admitted through holistic review\u201d); 758 F.\u00a03d, at 669\n(Garza, J., dissenting) (\u201cThe University does not assess whether\nTop Ten Percent Law admittees exhibit sufficient diversity within\ndiversity, whether the requisite \u2018change agents\u2019 are among them,\nand whether these admittees are able, collectively or individually,\nto combat pernicious stereotypes\u201d). Furthermore, UT has not\nidentified \u201cwhen, if ever, its goal (which remains undefined) for\nqualitative diversity will be reached.\u201dId.,at 671. UT\u2019s\nintraracial diversity rationale is thus too imprecise to permit\nstrict scrutiny analysis.Finally, UT\u2019s shifting positions on intraracial\ndiversity, and the fact that intraracial diversity was not\nemphasized in the Proposal, suggest that it was not \u201cthe actual\npurpose underlying the discriminatory classification.\u201dMississippi Univ. for Womenv.Hogan, 458 U.\u00a0S.\n718, 730 (1982) . Instead, it appears to be apost hocrationalization.4UT also alleges\u2014and the majority embraces\u2014an\ninterest in avoiding \u201cfeelings of loneliness and isolation\u201d among\nminority students.Ante, at 14\u201315; see Brief for Respondents\n7\u20138, 38\u201339. In support of this argument, they cite only demographic\ndata and anecdotal statements by UT officials that some students\n(we are not told how many) feel \u201cisolated.\u201d This vague interest\ncannot possibly satisfy strict scrutiny.If UT is seeking demographic parity to avoid\nisolation, that is impermissible racial balancing. See Part II\u2013C\u20131,supra. And linking racial loneliness and isolation to state\ndemographics is illogical. Imagine, for example, that an\nAfrican-American student attends a university that is 20%\nAfrican-American. If racial isolation depends on a comparison to\nstate demographics, then that student is more likely to feel\nisolated if the school is located in Mississippi (which is 37.0%\nAfrican-American) than if it is located in Montana (which is 0.4%\nAfrican-American). See United States Census Bureau, QuickFacts,\nonline at https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/table/PST045215/28,30.\nIn reality, however, the student may feel\u2014if anything\u2014lessisolated in Mississippi, where African-Americans are more prevalent\nin the population at large.If, on the other hand, state demographics are\nnot driving UT\u2019s interest in avoiding racial isolation, then its\ntreatment of Asian-American students is hard to understand. As the\nDistrict Court noted, \u201cthe gross number of Hispanic students\nattending UT exceeds the gross number of Asian-American students.\u201d\n645 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d, at 606. In 2008, for example, UT enrolled\n1,338 Hispanic freshmen and 1,249 Asian-American freshmen. Supp.\nApp. 156a. UT never explains why the Hispanic students\u2014but not the\nAsian-American students\u2014are isolated and lonely enough to receive\nan admissions boost, notwithstanding the fact that there are more\nHispanics than Asian-Americans in the student population. The\nanecdotal statements from UT officials certainly do not indicate\nthat Hispanics are somehow lonelier than Asian-Americans.Ultimately, UT has failed to articulate its\ninterest in preventing racial isolation with any clarity, and it\nhas provided no clear indication of how it will know when such\nisolation no longer exists. Like UT\u2019s purported interests in\ndemographic parity, classroom diversity, and intraracial diversity,\nits interest in avoiding racial isolation cannot justify the use of\nracial preferences.DEven assuming UT is correct that, underGrutter, it need only cite a generic interest in the\neducational benefits of diversity, its plan still fails strict\nscrutiny because it is not narrowly tailored. Narrow tailoring\nrequires \u201ca careful judicial inquiry into whether a university\ncould achieve sufficient diversity without using racial\nclassifications.\u201dFisher I, 570 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 10). \u201cIf a \u2018\u00a0\u201cnonracial approach .\u00a0.\u00a0. could\npromote the substantial interest about as well and at tolerable\nadministrative expense,\u201d\u00a0\u2019 then the university may not\nconsider race.\u201dId.,at ___ (slip op., at 11) (citations\nomitted). Here, there is no evidence that race-blind, holistic\nreview would not achieve UT\u2019s goals at least \u201cabout as well\u201d as\nUT\u2019s race-based policy. In addition, UT could have adopted other\napproaches to further its goals, such as intensifying its outreach\nefforts, uncapping the Top Ten Percent Law, or placing greater\nweight on socioeconomic factors.The majority argues that none of these\nalternatives is \u201ca workable means for the University to attain the\nbenefits of diversity it sought.\u201dAnte, at 16. Tellingly,\nhowever, the majority devotes only a single, conclusory sentence to\nthe most obvious race-neutral alternative: race-blind, holistic\nreview that considers the applicant\u2019s unique characteristics and\npersonal circumstances. Seeibid.[14] Under a system that combines the Top Ten Percent\nPlan with race-blind, holistic review, UT could still admit \u201cthe\nstar athlete or musician whose grades suffered because of daily\npractices and training,\u201d the \u201ctalented young biologist who\nstruggled to maintain above-average grades in humanities classes,\u201d\nand the \u201cstudent whose freshman-year grades were poor because of a\nfamily crisis but who got herself back on track in her last three\nyears of school.\u201dAnte,at 17. All of these unique\ncircumstances can be considered without injecting race into the\nprocess. Because UT has failed to provide any evidence whatsoever\nthat race-conscious holistic review will achieve its diversity\nobjectives more effectively than race-blind holistic review, it\ncannot satisfy the heavy burden imposed by the strict scrutiny\nstandard.The fact that UT\u2019s racial preferences are\nunnecessary to achieve its stated goals is further demonstrated by\ntheir minimal effect on UT\u2019s diversity. In 2004, when race was not\na factor, 3.6% of non-Top Ten Percent Texas enrollees were\nAfrican-American and 11.6% were Hispanic. See Supp. App. 157a. It\nwould stand to reason that at least the same percentages of\nAfrican-American and Hispanic students would have been admitted\nthrough holistic review in 2008 even if race were not a factor. If\nthat assumption is correct, then race was determinative for only 15\nAfrican-American students and 18 Hispanic students in 2008\n(representing 0.2% and 0.3%, respectively, of the total enrolled\nfirst-time freshmen from Texas high schools). Seeibid.[15]The majority contends that \u201c[t]he fact that race\nconsciousness played a role in only a small portion of admissions\ndecisions should be a hallmark of narrow tailoring, not evidence of\nunconstitutionality.\u201dAnte,at 15. This argument directly\ncontradicts this Court\u2019s precedent. Because racial classifications\nare \u201c\u00a0\u2018a highly suspect tool,\u2019\u00a0\u201dGrutter, 539\nU.\u00a0S, at 326, they should be employed only \u201cas a last resort,\u201dCroson, 488 U.\u00a0S., at 519 (opinion of Kennedy, J.); see\nalsoGrutter,supra, at 342 (\u201c[R]acial\nclassifications, however compelling their goals, are potentially so\ndangerous that they may be employed no more broadly than the\ninterest demands\u201d). Where, as here, racial preferences have only a\nslight impact on minority enrollment, a race-neutral alternative\nlikely could have reached the same result. SeeParents\nInvolved, 551 U.\u00a0S., at 733\u2013734 (holding that the \u201cminimal\neffect\u201d of school districts\u2019 racial classifications \u201ccasts doubt on\nthe necessity of using [such] classifications\u201d and \u201csuggests that\nother means [of achieving their objectives] would be effective\u201d).\nAs Justice Kennedy once aptly put it, \u201cthe small number of\n[students] affected suggests that the schoo[l] could have achieved\n[its] stated ends through different means.\u201dId.,at 790\n(opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment). And in\nthis case, a race-neutral alternative could accomplish UT\u2019s\nobjectives without gratuitously branding the covers of tens of\nthousands of applications with a bare racial stamp and \u201ctell[ing]\neach student he or she is to be defined by race.\u201dId.,at\n789.IIIThe majority purports to agree with much of\nthe above analysis. The Court acknowledges that \u201c\u00a0\u2018because\nracial characteristics so seldom provide a relevant basis for\ndisparate treatment,\u2019\u00a0\u201d \u201c\u00a0\u2018[r]ace may not be considered\n[by a university] unless the admissions process can withstand\nstrict scrutiny.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAnte,at 6\u20137. The Court admits that\nthe burden of proof is on UT,ante,at 7, and that \u201ca\nuniversity bears a heavy burden in showing that it had not obtained\nthe educational benefits of diversity before it turned to a\nrace-conscious plan,\u201dante,at 13\u201314. And the Court\nrecognizes that the record here is \u201calmost devoid of information\nabout the students who secured admission to the Univer-sity through\nthe Plan,\u201d and that \u201c[t]he Court thus cannot know how students\nadmitted solely based on their class rank differ in their\ncontribution to diversity from students admitted through holistic\nreview.\u201dAnte,at 9. This should be the end of the case:\nWithout identifying what was missing from the African-American and\nHispanic students it was already admitting through its race-neutral\nprocess, and without showing how the use of race-based admissions\ncould rectify the deficiency, UT cannot demonstrate that its\nprocedure is narrowly tailored.Yet, somehow, the majority concludes thatpetitionermust lose as a result of UT\u2019s failure to provide\nevidence justifying its decision to employ racial discrimination.\nTellingly, the Court frames its analysis as if petitioner bears the\nburden of proof here. Seeante, at 11\u201319. But it is not the\npetitioner\u2019s burden to show that the consideration of race is\nunconstitutional. To the extent the record is inadequate, the\nresponsibility lies with UT. For \u201c[w]hen a court subjects\ngovernmental action to strict scrutiny, it cannot construe\nambiguities in favor of the State,\u201dParents Involved,supra, at 786 (opinion of Kennedy, J.), particularly where,\nas here, the summary judgment posture obligates the Court to view\nthe facts in the light most favorable to petitioner, seeMatsushita Elec. Industrial Co.v.Zenith Radio\nCorp., 475 U.\u00a0S. 574, 587 (1986) .Given that the University bears the burden of\nproof, it is not surprising that UT never made the argument that it\nshould win based on thelackof evidence. UT instead asserts\nthat \u201cif the Court believes there are any deficiencies in [the]\nrecord that cast doubt on the constitutionality of UT\u2019s policy, the\nanswer is to order a trial, not to grant summary judgment.\u201d Brief\nfor Respondents 51; see alsoid., at 52\u201353 (\u201c[I]f this Court\nhas any doubts about how the Top 10% Law works, or how UT\u2019s\nholistic plan offsets the tradeoffs of the Top 10% Law, the answer\nis to remand for a trial\u201d). Nevertheless, the majority cites three\nreasons for breaking from the normal strict scrutiny standard. None\nof these is convincing.AFirst, the Court states that, while \u201cth[e]\nevidentiary gap perhaps could be filled by a remand to the district\ncourt for further factfinding\u201d in \u201can ordinary case,\u201d that will not\nwork here because \u201c[w]hen petitioner\u2019s application was rejected,\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. the University\u2019s combined\npercentage-plan/holistic-review approach to admission had been in\neffect for just three years,\u201d so \u201cfurther factfinding\u201d \u201cmight yield\nlittle insight.\u201dAnte,at 9. This reasoning is dangerously\nincorrect. The Equal Protection Clause does not provide a 3-year\ngrace period for racial discrimination. Under strict scrutiny, UT\nwas required to identify evidence that race-based admissions were\nnecessary to achieve a compelling interestbeforeit put\nthem in place\u2014not three or more years after. Seeante,at\n13\u201314 (\u201cPetitioner is correct that a university bears a heavy\nburden in showing that it had not obtained the educational benefits\nof diversitybeforeit turned to a race-conscious plan\u201d\n(emphasis added));Fisher I, 570 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 11) (\u201c[S]trict scrutiny imposes on the university the\nultimate burden of demonstrating,beforeturning to racial\nclassifications, that available, workable race-neutral alternatives\ndo not suffice\u201d (emphasis added)). UT\u2019s failure to obtain actual\nevidence that racial preferences were necessary before resolving to\nuse them only confirms that its decision to inject race into\nadmissions was a reflexive response toGrutter,[16] and that UT did not seriously\nconsider whether race-neutral means would serve its goals as well\nas a race-based process.BSecond, in an effort to excuse UT\u2019s lack of\nevidence, the Court argues that because \u201cthe University lacks any\nauthority to alter the role of the Top Ten Percent Plan,\u201d \u201cit\nsimilarly had no reason to keep extensive data on the Plan or the\nstudents admitted under it\u2014particularly in the years beforeFisher Iclarified the stringency of the strict-scrutiny\nburden for a school that employs race-conscious review.\u201dAnte, at 9\u201310. But UT has long been aware that it bears the\nburden of justifying its racial discrimination under strict\nscrutiny. See,e.g.,Brief for Respondents in No. 11\u2013345, at\n22 (\u201cIt is undisputed that UT\u2019s consideration of race in its\nholistic admissions process triggers strict scrutiny,\u201d and \u201cthat\ninquiry is undeniably rigorous\u201d).[17] In light of this burden, UT hadeveryreason\nto keep data on the students admitted through the Top Ten Percent\nPlan. Without such data, how could UT have possibly identified any\ncharacteristics that were lacking in Top Ten Percent admittees and\nthat could be obtained via race-conscious admissions? How could UT\ndetermine that employing a race-based process would serve its goals\nbetter than, for instance, expanding the Top Ten Percent Plan? UT\ncould not possibly make such determinations without studying the\nstudents admitted under the Top Ten Percent Plan. Its failure to do\nso demonstrates that UT unthinkingly employed a race-based process\nwithout examining whether the use of race was actually necessary.\nThis is not\u2014as the Court claims\u2014a \u201cgood-faith effor[t] to comply\nwith the law.\u201dAnte, at 10.The majority\u2019s willingness to cite UT\u2019s \u201cgood\nfaith\u201d as the basis for excusing its failure to adduce evidence is\nparticularly inappropriate in light of UT\u2019s well-documented absence\nof good faith. Since UT described its admissions policy to this\nCourt inFisher I, it has been revealed that this\ndescription was incomplete. As explained in an independent\ninvestigation into UT admissions, UT maintained a clandestine\nadmissions system that evaded public scrutiny until a former\nadmissions officer blew the whistle in 2014. See Kroll, Inc.,\nUniver-sity of Texas at Austin\u2014Investigation of Admissions\nPrac-tices and Allegations of Undue Influence 4 (Feb. 6, 2015)\n(Kroll Report). Under this longstanding, secret process, university\nofficials regularly overrode normal holistic review to allow\npolitically connected individuals\u2014such as donors, alumni,\nlegislators, members of the Board of Regents, and UT officials and\nfaculty\u2014to get family members and other friends admitted to UT,\ndespite having grades and standardized test scores substantially\nbelow the median for admitted students.Id., at 12\u201314; see\nalso Blanchard & Hoppe, Influential Texans Helped\nUnderqualified Students Get Into UT, Dallas Morning News, July 20,\n2015, online at http://www.dallasnews.com/news/\neducation\u00a0/\u00a0headlines\u00a0/\u00a020150720\u00a0-\u00a0influential\u00a0-\u00a0texans-helped-underqualified-students-get-into-ut.ece\n(\u201cDozens of highly influential Texans\u2014including lawmakers,\nmillionaire donors and university regents\u2014helped underqualified\nstudents get into the University of Texas, often by writing to UT\nofficials, records show\u201d).UT officials involved in this covert process\nintentionally kept few records and destroyed those that did exist.\nSee,e.g.,Kroll Report 43 (\u201cEfforts were made to minimize\npaper trails and written lists during this end-of-cycle process. At\none meeting, the administrative assistants tried not keeping any\nnotes, but this proved difficult, so they took notes and later\nshredded them. One administrative assistant usually brought to\nthese meetings a stack of index cards that were subsequently\ndestroyed\u201d); see alsoid., at 13 (finding that \u201cwritten\nrecords or notes\u201d of the secret admissions meetings \u201care not\nmaintained and are typically shredded\u201d). And in the course of this\nlitigation, UT has been less than forthright concerning its\ntreatment of well-connected applicants. Compare,e.g.,Tr.\nof Oral Arg. 51 (Dec. 9, 2015) (\u201cUniversity of Texas does not do\nlegacy, Your Honor\u201d), and App. 281a (\u201c[O]ur legacy policy is such\nthat we don\u2019t consider legacy\u201d), with Kroll Report 29 (discussing\nevidence that \u201calumni/legacy influence\u201d \u201cresults each year in\ncertain applicants receiving a competitive boost or special\nconsideration in the admissions process,\u201d and noting that this is\n\u201can aspect of the admissions process that does not appear in the\npublic representations of UT-Austin\u2019s admissions process\u201d). Despite\nUT\u2019s apparent readiness to mislead the public and the Court, the\nmajority is \u201cwilling to be satisfied by [UT\u2019s] profession of its\nown good faith.\u201dGrutter, 539 U.\u00a0S., at 394 (Kennedy,\nJ., dissenting).[18]Notwithstanding the majority\u2019s claims to the\ncontrary, UT should have access to plenty of information about \u201chow\nstudents admitted solely based on their class rank differ in their\ncontribution to diversity from students admitted through holistic\nreview.\u201dAnte,at 9. UT undoubtedly knows which students\nwere admitted through the Top Ten Percent Plan and which were\nadmitted through holistic review. See,e.g.,Supp. App.\n157a. And it undoubtedly has a record of all of the classes in\nwhich these students enrolled. See,e.g.,UT, Office of the\nReg-istrar, Transcript\u2014Official, online at\nhttps://registrar.utexas.edu/students/transcripts-official\n(instructing graduates on how to obtain a transcript listing a\n\u201ccomprehensive record\u201d of classes taken). UT could use this\ninformation to demonstrate whether the Top Ten Percent minority\nadmittees were more or less likely than the holistic minority\nadmittees to choose to enroll in the courses lacking diversity.In addition, UT assigns PAI scores to all\nstudents\u2014including those admitted through the Top Ten Percent\nPlan\u2014for purposes of admission to individual majors. Accordingly,\nall students must submit a full application containing essays,\nletters of recommendation, a resume, a list of courses taken in\nhigh school, and a description of any extracurricular activities,\nleadership experience, or special circumstances. See App.\n212a\u2013214a; 235a\u2013236a; 758 F.\u00a03d, at 669, n.\u00a014 (Garza,\nJ., dissenting). Unless UT has destroyed these files,[19] it could use them to compare the\nunique personal characteristics of Top Ten minority admittees with\nthose of holistic minority admittees, and to determine whether the\nTop Ten admittees are, in fact, less desirable than the holistic\nadmittees. This may require UT to expend some resources, but that\nis an appropriate burden in light of the strict scrutiny standard\nand the fact that all of the relevant information is in UT\u2019s\npossession. The cost of factfinding is a strange basis for awarding\na victory to UT, which has a huge budget, and a loss to petitioner,\nwho does not.Finally, while I agree with the majority and the\nFifth Circuit thatFisher Isignificantly changed the\ngoverning law by clarifying the stringency of the strict scrutiny\nstandard,[20] that does not\nexcuse UT from meeting that heavy burden. InAdarand, for\ninstance, another case in which the Court clarified the rigor of\nthe strict scrutiny standard, the Court acknowledged that its\ndecision \u201calter[ed] the playing field in some important respects.\u201d\n515 U.\u00a0S., at 237. As a result, it \u201cremand[ed] the case to the\nlower courts for further considerationin light of the\nprinciples [it had] announced.\u201dIbid.(emphasis added).\nIn other words, the Court made clear that\u2014notwithstanding the shift\nin the law\u2014the government had to meet the clarified burden it was\nannouncing. The Court did not embrace the notion that its decision\nto alter the stringency of the strict scrutiny standard somehow\nallowed the government to automatically prevail.CThird, the majority notes that this litigation\nhas persisted for many years, that petitioner has already graduated\nfrom another college, that UT\u2019s policy may have changed over time,\nand that this case may offer little prospective guidance. At most,\nthese considerations counsel in favor of dismissing this case as\nimprovidently granted. But see,e.g., Gratz, 539 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 251, and n.\u00a01, 260\u2013262 (rejecting the dissent\u2019s argument\nthat, because the case had already persisted long enough for the\npetitioners to graduate from other schools, the case should be\ndismissed);id.,at 282 (Stevens, J., dissenting). None of\nthese considerations has any bearing whatsoever on the merits of\nthis suit. The majority cannot side with UT simply because it is\ntired of this case.IVIt is important to understand what is and what\nis not at stake in this case.What is not at stakeis\nwhether UT or any other university may adopt an admissions plan\nthat results in a student body with a broad representation of\nstudents from all racial and ethnic groups. UT previously had a\nrace-neutral plan that it claimed had \u201ceffectively compensated for\nthe loss of affirmative action,\u201d App. 396a, and UT could have taken\nother steps that would have increased the diversity of its admitted\nstudents without taking race or ethnic background into account.What is at stakeis whether university\nadministrators may justify systematic racial discrimination simply\nby asserting that such discrimination is necessary to achieve \u201cthe\neducational benefits of diversity,\u201d without explaining\u2014much less\nproving\u2014why the discrimination is needed or how the discriminatory\nplan is well crafted to serve its objectives. Even though UT has\nnever provided any coherent explanation for its asserted need to\ndiscriminate on the basis of race, and even though UT\u2019s position\nrelies on a series of unsupported and noxious racial assumptions,\nthe majority concludes that UT has met its heavy burden. This\nconclusion is remarkable\u2014and remarkably wrong.Because UT has failed to satisfy strict\nscrutiny, I respectfully dissent.Notes1See also Nissimov, UT To\nResume Factoring in Applicants\u2019 Race: UT To Reintroduce Race-Based\nCriteria, Houston Chronicle, June 24, 2003, p. 4A (\u201cPresident Larry\nFaulkner said Monday his institution will quickly develop\nrace-based admissions criteria by the fall that would be used for\nthe summer and fall of 2004, after being given the green light to\ndo so by Monday\u2019s U.\u00a0S.

See Supp. App. 156a; United\nStates Census Bureau, QuickFacts (QuickFacts Texas), online at\nhttps://www.census.gov/quickfacts/table/PST045215/48. By contrast,\n37.6% of Texas\u2019s 2010 population identified as Hispanic or Latino,\nbut a lower percentage\u201419.9%\u2014of UT\u2019s enrolled, first-time freshmen\nin 2008 were Hispanic. See Supp. App. 156a; QuickFacts\nTexas.3If UT\u2019s goal is to have\nat least two African-Americans, two Hispanics, and two\nAsian-Americans present in each of the relevant classrooms, that\ngoal is literally unreachable in classes of five and practi-cally\nunreachable in many other small classes.4The majority\u2019s assertion\nthat UT\u2019s race-based policy does not discriminate against\nAsian-American students, seeante,at 5\u20136, defies the laws\nof mathematics. UT\u2019s program is clearly designed to increase the\nnumber of African-American and Hispanic students by giving them an\nadmissions boost vis-\u00e0-vis other applicants. See,e.g.,Supp. App. 25a; App. 445a\u2013446a; cf. 645 F. Supp. 2d 587, 606 (WD\nTex. 2009); see alsoante,at 15 (citing increases in the\npresence of African-Americans and Hispanics at UT as evidence that\nits race-based program was successful). Given a \u201climited number of\nspaces,\u201d App. 250a, providing a boost to African-Americans and\nHispanics inevitably harms students who do not receive the same\nboost by decreasing their odds of admission.5In particular, the Fifth\nCircuit\u2019s willful blindness to Asian-American students is\nabsolutely shameless. For instance, one of the Fifth Circuit\u2019s\nprimary contentions\u2014which UT repeatedly highlighted in its brief\nand at argument\u2014is that, given the SAT score gaps between whites on\nthe one hand and African-Americans and Hispanics on the other,\n\u201cholistic admissions would approach an all-white enterprise\u201d in the\nabsence of racial preferences. 758 F.\u00a03d, at 647. In making\nthis argument, the court below failed to mention Asian-Americans.\nThe reason for this omission is obvious: As indicated inthevery sourcesthat the Fifth Circuit relied on for this\npoint, onthevery pagesit cited, Asian-American\nenrollees admitted to UT through holistic review have consistentlyhigheraverage SAT scores than white enrollees admitted\nthrough holistic review.

Seeante,at 16 (\u201cPerhaps\nmore significantly, in the wake ofHopwood, the University\nspent seven years attempt-ing to achieve its compelling interest\nusing race-neutral holistic review\u201d). But the Court never explains\nits basis for concluding that UT\u2019s previous system failed. We are\nnot told how the Court is measuring success or how it knows that a\nrace-conscious program will satisfy UT\u2019s goals more effectively\nthan race-neutral, holistic review. And although the majority\nelsewhere emphasizes \u201cthe University\u2019s continuing obligation to\nsatisfy the burden of strict scrutiny in light of changing\ncircumstances,\u201dante,at 10, its rejection of race-blind,\nholistic review relies exclusively on \u201cevidence\u201d predating\npetitioner\u2019s suit by five years.15In\n2008, 1,208 first-time freshmen from Texas high schools enrolled at\nUT after being admitted outside the Top Ten Percent Plan. Supp.\nApp. 157a. Based on the 2004 statistics, it is reasonable to assume\nthat, if the University had undertaken arace-neutralholistic review in 2008, 3.6% (43) of these students would have\nbeen African-American and 11.6% (140) would have been Hispanic. Seeibid.Under the University\u2019srace-consciousholistic\nreview, 58 African-American freshmen from Texas and 158 Hispanic\nfreshmen from Texas were enrolled in 2008, thus reflecting an\nincrease of only 15 African-American students and 18 Hispanic\nstudents. And if those marginal increases (of 15 and 18 students)\nare divided by the number of total enrolled first-time freshmen\nfrom Texas high schools (6,322), seeibid., the calculation\nyields the 0.2% and 0.3% percentages mentioned in the text\nabove.16Recall that UT\u2019s president vowed to\nreinstate race-conscious admissions within hours ofGrutter\u2019s release.

No. 1, 551 U.\u00a0S. 701, 720 (2007)\n(\u201cIt is well established that when the government distributes\nburdens or benefits on the basis of individual racial\nclassifications, that action is reviewed under strict scrutiny\u201d);Grutterv.Bollinger, 539 U.\u00a0S. 306, 326 (2003)\n(\u201cWe have held that all racial classifications imposed by\ngovernment \u2018must be analyzed by a reviewing court under strict\nscrutiny\u2019\u00a0\u201d);Gratzv.Bollinger, 539 U.\u00a0S.\n244, 270 (2003) (\u201cIt is by now well established that \u2018all racial\nclassifications reviewable under the Equal Protection Clause must\nbe strictly scrutinized\u2019\u00a0\u201d);Adarand Constructors, Inc.v.Pe\u00f1a, 515 U.\u00a0S. 200, 227 (1995) (\u201c[W]e hold today\nthat all racial classifications, imposed by whatever federal,\nstate, or local government actor, must be analyzed by a reviewing\ncourt under strict scrutiny\u201d).18The\nmajority\u2019s claim that UT has not \u201chad a full opportunity to respond\nto\u201d the Kroll Report,ante,at 14, is simply wrong. The\nreport was discussed in no less than six of the briefs filed in\nthis case. See Brief in Opposition 19\u201320, n.\u00a02; Reply to Brief\nin Opposition 6; Brief for Respondents 51, n.\u00a09; Brief for\nCato Institute asAmicus Curiae8\u201312 (certiorari stage);\nBrief for Cato Institute asAmicus Curiae12, and n.\u00a04\n(merits stage); Brief for Judicial Education Project asAmicus\nCuriae5\u201317. Not only did UT have an \u201copportunity to respond\u201d\nto the Kroll Report\u2014itdid in fact respondat both the\ncertiorari stage and the merits stage. See Brief in Opposition\n19\u201320, n.\u00a02 (explicitly discussing the \u201crecently released\nKroll Report\u201d); Brief for Respondents 51, n.\u00a09 (similar). And\nthe Court\u2019s purported concern about reliance on \u201cextrarecord\nmaterials,\u201dante,at 14, rings especially hollow in light of\nits willingness to affirm the decision below, which relied heavily\non the Fifth Circuit\u2019s own extrarecord Internet research, see,e.g.,758 F.\u00a03d, at 650\u2013653.19UT\u2019s\ncurrent records retention policy requires it to retain student\nrecords, including application materials, for at least five years\nafter a student graduates. See University of Texas at Austin,\nRecords Retention Schedule, Agency Item No. AALL358, p. 58 (Nov.\n14, 2014), online at\nhttps://www.tsl.texas.gov/sites/default/files/public/tslac/slrm/state/\nschedules/721.pdf. If this policy was in place when UT resumed\nrace-conscious admissions in 2004, then it still had these\nmaterials when petitioner filed this suit in 2008, and likely still\nhad them at the time ofFisher Iin 2013. At the very least,\nthe application materials for the 2008 freshman class appear to be\nsubject to a litigation hold. See App. 290a\u2013292a. To the extent\nthat UT failed to preserve these records, the consequences of that\ndecision should fall on the University, not on petitioner. Cf.Tyson Foods, Inc.v.Bouaphakeo, 577 U.\u00a0S. ___,\n___ (2016) (slip op., at 12) (allowing \u201ca representative sample to\nfill an evidentiary gap created by the employer\u2019s failure to keep\nadequate records\u201d).20Seeante,at 10 (\u201cFisher Iclarified the stringency of\nthe strict-scrutiny burden for a school that employs race-conscious\nreview\u201d); 758 F.\u00a03d, at 642 (\u201cBringing forward Justice\nKennedy\u2019s dissent inGrutter, the Supreme Court faulted the\ndistrict court\u2019s and this Court\u2019s review of UT Austin\u2019s means to\nachieve the permissible goal of diversity\u201d);id.,at 665,\nn.\u00a05 (Garza, J., dissenting) (\u201cI agree with the majority thatFisherrepresents a decisive shift in the\nlaw\u201d).",
