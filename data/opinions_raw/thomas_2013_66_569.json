We granted certiorari to resolve whether such\na case is justiciable when the lone plaintiff\u2019s individual claim\nbecomes moot. 567 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2012). We hold that it is not\njusticiable.IThe FLSA establishes federal minimum-wage,\nmaximum-hour, and overtime guarantees that cannot be modified by\ncontract. Section 16(b) of the FLSA, 52Stat. 1060, as amended, 29\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7216(b), gives employees the right to bring a\nprivate cause of action on their own behalf and on behalf of \u201cother\nemployees similarly situated\u201d for specified violations of the FLSA.\nA suit brought on behalf of other employees is known as a\n\u201ccollective action.\u201d SeeHoffmann-La Roche Inc.v.Sperling,493 U.S.\n165, 169\u2013170 (1989).In 2009, respondent, who was formerly employed\nby petitioners as a registered nurse at Pennypack Center in\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania, filed a complaint on behalf of herself\nand \u201call other persons similarly situated.\u201d App. 115\u2013116.\nRespondent alleged that petitioners violated the FLSA by\nautomatically deducting 30 minutes of time worked per shift for\nmeal breaks for certain employees, even when the employees\nperformed compensable work during those breaks. Respondent, who\nremained the sole plaintiff throughout these proceedings, sought\nstatutory damages for the alleged violations.When petitioners answered the complaint, they\nsimultaneously served upon respondent an offer of judgment under\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 68. The offer included $7,500 for\nalleged unpaid wages, in addition to \u201csuch reasonable attorneys\u2019\nfees, costs, and expenses .\u00a0.\u00a0. as the Court may\ndetermine.\u201dId.,at 77. Petition- ers stipulated that if\nrespondent did not accept the offer within 10 days after service,\nthe offer would be deemed withdrawn.After respondent failed to respond in the\nallotted time period, petitioners filed a motion to dismiss for\nlack of subject-matter jurisdiction. Petitioners argued that\nbecause they offered respondent complete relief on her individual\ndamages claim, she no longer possessed a personal stake in the\noutcome of the suit, rendering the action moot. Respondent\nobjected, arguing that petitioners were inappropriately attempting\nto \u201cpick off\u201d the named plaintiff before the collective-action\nprocess could unfold.Id.,at 91.The District Court found that it was undisputed\nthat no other individuals had joined respondent\u2019s suit and that the\nRule 68 offer of judgment fully satisfied her individual claim. It\nconcluded that petitioners\u2019 Rule 68 offer of judgment mooted\nrespondent\u2019s suit, which it dismissed for lack of subject-matter\njurisdiction.The Court of Appeals reversed. 656 F.3d 189 (CA3\n2011). The court agreed that no other potential plaintiff had opted\ninto the suit, that petitioners\u2019 offer fully satisfied respondent\u2019s\nindividual claim, and that, under its precedents, whether or not\nsuch an offer is accepted, it generally moots a plaintiff\u2019s claim.Id.,at 195. But the court nevertheless held that\nrespondent\u2019s collective action was not moot. It explained that\ncalculated attempts by some defendants to \u201cpick off\u201d named\nplaintiffs with strategic Rule 68 offers before certification could\nshort circuit the process, and, thereby, frustrate the goals of\ncollective actions.Id.,at 196\u2013198. The court determined\nthat the case must be remanded in order to allow respondent to seek\n\u201cconditional certification\u201d[1]\nin the District Court. If respondent were successful, the District\nCourt was to relate the certification motion back to the date on\nwhich respondent filed her complaint.[2]Ibid.IIArticle III, \u00a72, of the Constitution limits\nthe jurisdiction of federal courts to \u201cCases\u201d and \u201cControversies,\u201d\nwhich restricts the authority of federal courts to resolving\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018the legal rights of litigants in actual\ncontroversies,\u2019\u00a0\u201dValley Forge Christian Collegev.Americans United for Separation of Church and State, Inc.,454 U.S.\n464, 471 (1982) (quotingLiverpool, New York &\nPhiladelphia S.\u00a0S. Co.v.Commissioners of\nEmigration,113 U.S.\n33, 39 (1885)). In order to invoke federal-court jurisdiction,\na plaintiff must demonstrate that he possesses a legally cognizable\ninterest, or \u201c\u00a0\u2018personal stake,\u2019\u00a0\u201d in the outcome of the\naction. SeeCamretav.Greene, 563 U.\u00a0S. ___,\n___ (2011) (slip op., at 5) (quotingSummersv.Earth\nIsland Institute,555 U.S.\n488, 493 (2009)). This requirement ensures that the Federal\nJudiciary confines itself to its constitutionally limited role of\nadjudicating actual and concrete disputes, the resolutions of which\nhave direct consequences on the parties involved.A corollary to this case-or-controversy\nrequirement is that \u201c\u00a0\u2018an actual controversy must be extant at\nall stages of review, not merely at the time the complaint is\nfiled.\u2019\u00a0\u201dArizonans for Official Englishv.Arizona,520 U.S.\n43, 67 (1997) (quotingPreiserv.Newkirk,422 U.S.\n395, 401 (1975)). If an intervening circumstance deprives the\nplaintiff of a \u201cpersonal stake in the outcome of the lawsuit,\u201d at\nany point during litigation, the action can no longer proceed and\nmust be dismissed as moot.Lewisv.Continental Bank\nCorp.,494\nU.S. 472, 477\u2013478 (1990) (internal quotation marks\nomitted).In the proceedings below, both courts concluded\nthat petitioners\u2019 Rule 68 offer afforded respondent complete relief\non\u2014and thus mooted\u2014her FLSA claim. See 656 F.\u00a03d, at 201; No.\n09\u20135782, 2010 WL 2038676, *4 (ED Pa., May 19, 2010). Respondent now\ncontends that these rulings were erroneous, because petitioners\u2019\nRule 68 offer lapsed without entry of judgment. Brief for\nRespondent 12\u201316. The United States, asamicus curiae,\nsimilarly urges the Court to hold that petitioners\u2019 unaccepted\noffer did not moot her FLSA claim and to affirm the Court of\nAppeals on this basis. Brief for United States 10\u201315.While the Courts of Appeals disagree whether an\nun-accepted offer that fully satisfies a plaintiff\u2019s claim is\nsufficient to render the claim moot,[3] we do not reach this question, or resolve the split,\nbecause the issue is not properly before us. The Third Circuit\nclearly held in this case that respondent\u2019s individual claim was\nmoot. 656 F.\u00a03d, at 201. Acceptance of respondent\u2019s argument\nto the contrary now would alter the Court of Appeals\u2019 judgment,\nwhich is impermissible in the absence of a cross-petition from\nrespondent. SeeNorthwest Airlines, Inc.v.County of\nKent,510 U.S.\n355, 364 (1994);Trans World Airlines, Inc.v.Thurston,469 U.S.\n111, 119, n.\u00a014 (1985). Moreover, even if the\ncross-petition rule did not apply, respondent\u2019s waiver of the issue\nwould still prevent us from reaching it. In the District Court,\nrespondent conceded that \u201c[a]n offer of complete relief will\ngenerally moot the [plaintiff\u2019s] claim, as at that point the\nplaintiff retains no personal interest in the outcome of the\nlitigation.\u201d App. 93; 2010 WL 2038676, at *4. Respondent made a\nsimilar concession in her brief to the Court of Appeals, see App.\n193, and failed to raise the argument in her brief in opposition to\nthe petition for certiorari. We, therefore, assume, without\ndeciding, that petitioners\u2019 Rule 68 offer mooted respondent\u2019s\nindividual claim. SeeBaldwinv.Reese,541 U.S.\n27, 34 (2004).IIIWe turn, then, to the question whether\nrespondent\u2019s action remained justiciable based on the\ncollective-action allegations in her complaint. A straightforward\napplication of well-settled mootness principles compels our answer.\nIn the absence of any claimant\u2019s opting in, respondent\u2019s suit\nbecame moot when her individual claim became moot, because she\nlacked any personal interest in representing others in this action.\nWhile the FLSA authorizes an aggrieved employee to bring an action\non behalf of himself and \u201cother employees similarly situated,\u201d 29\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7216(b), the mere presence of collective-action\nallegations in the complaint cannot save the suit from mootness\nonce the individual claim is satisfied.[4] In order to avoid this outcome, respondent relies\nalmost entirely upon cases that arose in the context of Federal\nRule of Civil Procedure 23 class actions, particularlyUnited\nStates Parole Comm\u2019nv.Geraghty,445 U.S.\n388(1980);Deposit Guaranty Nat. Bankv.Roper,445 U.S.\n326(1980); andSosnav.Iowa,419 U.S.\n393(1975). But these cases are inapposite, both because Rule\n23 actions are fundamentally different from collective actions\nunder the FLSA, seeHoffmann-La Roche Inc., 493 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 177\u2013178 (Scalia, J., dissenting), and because these cases are,\nby their own terms, inapplicable to these facts. It follows that\nthis action was appropriately dismissed as moot.ARespondent contends that she has a sufficient\npersonal stake in this case based on a statutorily created\ncollective- action interest in representing other similarly\nsituated employees under \u00a7216(b). Brief for Respondent 47\u201348. In\nsupport of her argument, respondent cites our decision inGeraghty, which in turn has its roots inSosna.\nNeither case supports her position.InSosna, the Court held that a class\naction is not rendered moot when the named plaintiff\u2019s individual\nclaim becomes mootafterthe class has been duly certified.\n419 U.\u00a0S., at 399. The Court reasoned that when a district\ncourt certifies a class, \u201cthe class of unnamed persons described in\nthe certification acquire[s] a legal status separate from the\ninterest asserted by [the named plaintiff],\u201d with the result that a\nlive controversy may continue to exist, even after the claim of the\nnamed plaintiff becomes moot.Id., at 399\u2013402.Geraghtynarrowly extended this principle todenialsof class certification motions. The Court held that where an action\nwould have acquired the independent legal status described inSosnabut for the district court\u2019s erroneous denial of class\ncertification, a corrected ruling on appeal \u201crelates back\u201d to the\ntime of the erroneous denial of the certification motion. 445\nU.\u00a0S., at 404, and n.\u00a011.Geraghtyis inapposite, because the Court\nexplicitly limited its holding to cases in which the named\nplaintiff\u2019s claim remains live at the time the district court\ndenies class certification. Seeid.,at 407, n.\u00a011.\nHere, respondent had not yet moved for \u201cconditional certification\u201d\nwhen her claim became moot, nor had the District Court\nanticipa-torily ruled on any such request. Her claim instead became\nmoot prior to these events, foreclosing any recourse toGeraghty. There is simply no certification decision to which\nrespondent\u2019s claim could have related back.More fundamentally, essential to our decisions\ninSosnaandGeraghtywas the fact that a putative\nclass acquires an independent legal status once it is certified\nunder Rule 23. Under the FLSA, by contrast, \u201cconditional\ncertification\u201d does not produce a class with an independent legal\nstatus, or join additional parties to the action. The sole\nconsequence of conditional certification is the sending of\ncourt-approved written notice to employees, seeHoffmann-La\nRoche Inc.,supra, at 171\u2013172, who in turn become\nparties to a collective action only by filing written con- sent\nwith the court, \u00a7216(b). So even if respondent were to secure a\nconditional certification ruling on remand, nothing in that ruling\nwould preserve her suit from mootness.BRespondent also advances an argument based on\na separate, but related, line of cases in which the Court held that\nan \u201cinherently transitory\u201d class-action claim is not necessarily\nmoot upon the termination of the named plaintiff\u2019s claim. Like our\ndecision inGeraghty, this line of cases began withSosnaand is similarly inapplicable here.After concluding that the expiration of a named\nplain-tiff\u2019s claim following certification does not moot the class\naction,Sosnasuggested that, where a named plaintiff\u2019s\nindividual claim becomes moot before the district court has an\nopportunity to rule on the certification motion, and the issue\nwould otherwise evade review, the certification might \u201crelate back\u201d\nto the filing of the complaint. 419 U.\u00a0S., at 402, n.\u00a011.\nThe Court has since held that the relation-back doctrine may apply\nin Rule 23 cases where it is \u201ccertain that other persons similarly\nsituated\u201d will continue to be subject to the challenged conduct and\nthe claims raised are \u201c\u00a0\u2018so inherently transitory that the\ntrial court will not have even enough time to rule on a motion for\nclass certification before the proposed representative\u2019s individual\ninterest expires.\u2019\u00a0\u201dCounty of Riversidev.McLaughlin,500 U.S.\n44, 52 (1991) (quotingGeraghty,supra, at 399),\nin turn citingGersteinv.Pugh,420 U.S.\n103, 110, n.\u00a011 (1975)). Invoking this doctrine,\nrespondent argues that defendants can strategically use Rule 68\noffers to \u201cpick off\u201d named plaintiffs before the collective-action\nprocess is complete, rendering collective actions \u201cinher-ently\ntransitory\u201d in effect. Brief for Respondent 37.Our cases invoking the \u201cinherently transitory\u201d\nrelation-back rationale do not apply. The \u201cinherently transitory\u201d\nrationale was developed to address circumstances in which the\nchallenged conduct was effectively unreviewable, because no\nplaintiff possessed a personal stake in the suit long enough for\nlitigation to run its course. A plaintiff might seek, for instance,\nto bring a class action challenging the constitutionality of\ntemporary pretrial detentions. In doing so, the named plaintiff\nwould face the considerable challenge of preserving his individual\nclaim from mootness, since pretrial custody likely would end prior\nto the resolution of his claim. SeeGerstein,supra.\nTo address this problem, the Court explained that in cases where\nthe transitory nature of the conduct giving rise to the suit would\neffectively insulate defendants\u2019 conduct from review, certification\ncould potentially \u201crelate back\u201d to the filing of the complaint.Id., at 110, n.\u00a011;McLaughlin,supra, at\n52. But this doctrine has invariably focused on the fleeting nature\nof the challenged conduct giving rise to the claim, not on the\ndefendant\u2019s litigation strategy. See,e.g.,Swisherv.Brady,438 U.S.\n204, 214, n.\u00a011 (1978);Spencerv.Kemna,523 U.S.\n1, 17\u201318 (1998).In this case, respondent\u2019s complaint requested\nstatutory damages. Unlike claims for injunctive relief challenging\nongoing conduct, a claim for damages cannot evade review; it\nremains live until it is settled, judicially resolved, or barred by\na statute of limitations. Nor can a defendant\u2019s attempt to obtain\nsettlement insulate such a claim from review, for a full settlement\noffer addresses plaintiff\u2019s alleged harm by making the plaintiff\nwhole. While settlement may have the collateral effect of\nforeclosing unjoined claimants from having their rights vindicated\ninrespondent\u2019ssuit, such putative plaintiffs remain free\nto vindicate their rights in their own suits. They are no less able\nto have their claims settled or adjudicated following respondent\u2019s\nsuit than if her suit had never been filed at all.CFinally, respondent argues that the purposes\nserved by the FLSA\u2019s collective-action provisions\u2014for example,\nefficient resolution of common claims and lower individual costs\nassociated with litigation\u2014would be frustrated by defendants\u2019 use\nof Rule 68 to \u201cpick off\u201d named plaintiffs before the\ncollective-action process has run its course. Both respondent and\nthe Court of Appeals purported to find support for this position in\nour decision inRoper, 445 U.\u00a0S., at 339.InRoper, the named plaintiffs\u2019\nindividual claims became moot after the District Court denied their\nmotion for class certification under Rule 23 and subsequently\nentered judgment in their favor, based on the defendant bank\u2019s\noffer of judgment for the maximum recoverable amount of damages, in\naddition to interest and court costs.Id., at 329\u2013330. The\nCourt held that even though the District Court had entered judgment\nin the named plaintiffs\u2019 favor, they could nevertheless appeal the\ndenial of their motion to certify the class. The Court found that,\nunder the particular circumstances of that case, the named\nplaintiffs possessed an ongoing, personal economic stake in the\nsubstantive controversy\u2014namely, to shift a portion of attorney\u2019s\nfees and expenses to successful class litigants.[5]Id.,at 332\u2013334, and n.\u00a06.\nOnly then, in dicta, did the Court underscore the importance of a\ndistrict court\u2019s class certification decision and observe that\nallowing defendants to \u201c\u00a0\u2018pic[k] off\u2019 \u201d party plaintiffs\nbefore an affirmative ruling was achieved \u201cwould frustrate the\nobjectives of class actions.\u201dId., at 339.Roper\u2019s holding turned on a specific\nfactual finding that the plaintiffs\u2019 possessed a continuing\npersonal economic stake in the litigation, even after the\ndefendants\u2019 offer of judgment.Id.,at 336. As already\nexplained, here, respondent conceded that petitioners\u2019 offer\n\u201cprovided complete relief on her individual claims,\u201d Brief in\nOpposition i, and she failed to assert any continuing economic\ninterest in shifting attorney\u2019s fees and costs to others. Moreover,Roper\u2019s dictum was tethered to the unique significance of\ncertification decisions in class-action proceedings. 445\nU.\u00a0S., at 339. Whatever significance \u201cconditional\ncertification\u201d may have in \u00a7216(b) proceedings, it is not\ntantamount to class certification under Rule 23.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*The Court of Appeals concluded that\nrespondent\u2019s individual claim became moot following petitioners\u2019\nRule 68 offer of judgment. We have assumed, without deciding, that\nthis is correct.Reaching the question on which we granted\ncertiorari, we conclude that respondent has no personal interest in\nrepresenting putative, unnamed claimants, nor any other continuing\ninterest that would preserve her suit from mootness. Respondent\u2019s\nsuit was, therefore, appropriately dismissed for lack of\nsubject-matter jurisdiction.The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the\nThird Circuit is reversed.It is so ordered.Notes1Lower courts have\nborrowed class-action terminology to describe the process of\njoining co-plaintiffs under 29 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7216(b). While we\ndo not express an opinion on the propriety of this use of\nclass-action nomenclature, we do note that there are significant\ndifferences between certification under Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 23 and the joinder process under \u00a7216(b).2The \u201crelation back\u201d\ndoctrine was developed in the context of class actions under Rule\n23 to address the circumstance in which a named plaintiff\u2019s claim\nbecomes moot prior to certification of the class. This case raises\ntwo circumstances in which the Court has applied this doctrine.\nFirst, where a named plaintiff\u2019s claim is \u201cinherently transi-tory,\u201d\nand becomes moot prior to certification, a motion for certification\nmay \u201crelate back\u201d to the filing of the complaint. See,e.g.,\nCounty of Riversidev.McLaughlin,500 U.S.\n44, 51\u201352 (1991). Second, we have held that where a\ncertification motion is denied and a named plaintiff\u2019s claim\nsubsequently becomes moot, an appellate reversal of the\ncertification decision may relate back to the time of the denial.\nSeeUnited States Parole Comm\u2019nv.Geraghty,445 U.S.\n388, 404 (1980).3Compare,e.g.,\nWeissv.Regal Collections,385 F.3d 337, 340 (CA3 2004), withMcCauleyv.Trans\nUnion, LLC,402 F.3d 340,342(CA2 2005).4While we do not resolve\nthe question whether a Rule 68 offer that fully satisfies the\nplaintiff\u2019s claims is sufficient by itself to moot the action,supra, at 5, we note that Courts of Appeals on both sides of\nthat issue have recognized that a plaintiff\u2019s claim may be\nsatisfied even without the plaintiff\u2019s consent. Some courts\nmaintain that an unaccepted offer of complete relief alone is\nsufficient to moot the individual\u2019s claim.E.g., Weiss,supra, at 340;Greiszv.Household Bank (Ill.),\nN.\u00a0A.,176 F.3d 1012, 1015 (CA7 1999). Other courts have held that, in\nthe face of an unaccepted offer of complete relief, district courts\nmay \u201center judgment in favor of the plaintiffs in accordance with\nthe defendants\u2019 Rule 68 offer of judgment.\u201dO\u2019Brienv.Ed\nDonnelly Enters., Inc., 575 F.3d 567, 575 (CA6 2009); see alsoMcCauleyv.Trans Union, LLC,402 F.3d 340,342(CA2 2005). Contrary to the dissent\u2019s assertion, seepost, at 8 (opinion of Kagan, J.), nothing in the nature of\nFLSA actions precludes satisfaction\u2014and thus the mooting\u2014of the\nindividual\u2019s claim before the collective-action component of the\nsuit has run its course.5BecauseRoperis\ndistinguishable on the facts, we need not consider its continuing\nvalidity in light of our subsequent decision inLewisv.Continental Bank Corp.,494 U.S.\n472(1990). Seeid.,at 480 (\u201c[An] interest in\nattorney\u2019s fees is, of course, insufficient to create an Article\nIII case or controversy where none exists on the merits of the\nunderlying claim\u201d).",
