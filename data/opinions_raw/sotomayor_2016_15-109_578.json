HIMMELREICHon writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the sixth circuit[June 6, 2016]Justice Sotomayor delivered the opinion of the\nCourt.The Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) allows\nplaintiffs to seek damages from the United States for certain torts\ncommitted by federal employees. 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a71346(b),\n2674. Many of the FTCA\u2019s procedural provisions are contained in a\nsingle chapter of the United States Code, Chapter 171. See\n\u00a7\u00a72671\u20132680. But an \u201cExceptions\u201d section of the FTCA dictates that\n\u201cthe provisions of [Chapter 171] . . . shall not apply\u201d to certain\ncategories of claims. At issue in this case is whether one of the\n\u201cprovisions of [Chapter 171]\u201d\u2014the so-called judgment bar provision,\n\u00a72676\u2014might nonetheless apply to one of the excepted claims. We\nconclude it does not.IAThis case began with two suits filed by Walter\nHimmelreich. In each, Himmelreich alleged that he had been severely\nbeaten by a fellow inmate in federal prison and that the beating\nwas the result of prison officials\u2019 negligence. At the time of the\nbeating, Himmelreich was incarcerated for producing child\npornography. His assailant had warned prison officials that he\nwould \u201c\u00a0\u2018smash\u2019\u00a0\u201d a pedophile if given the opportunity\nbut was nonetheless released into the general prison population,\nwhere he assaulted Himmelreich. App. 46.Himmelreich filed a first suit against the\nUnited States. The Government treated this first suit as a claim\nunder the FTCA and moved to dismiss the action, arguing that the\nclaim fell into one of the \u201cExceptions\u201d to the FTCA for \u201c[a]ny\nclaim based upon .\u00a0.\u00a0. the exercise or performance\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. [of] a discretionary function,\u201d namely, deciding\nwhere to house inmates. \u00a72680(a). The District Court granted the\nGovernment\u2019s motion to dismiss. (Neither party here challenges the\noutcome of that first suit.)But before the District Court dismissed that\nfirst suit, Himmelreich filed a second suit, this one a\nconstitutional tort suit against individual Bureau of Prison\nemployees rather than against the United States. Ordinarily, the\nFTCA would have nothing to say about such claims. But after the\ndismissal of Himmelreich\u2019s first suit, the individual employee\ndefendants argued that Himmelreich\u2019s second suit was foreclosed by\nthe FTCA\u2019s judgment bar provision, according to which a judgment in\nan FTCA suit forecloses any future suit against individual\nemployees. See \u00a72676. As relevant here, the District Court agreed\nand granted summary judgment in favor of the individual prison\nemployees.Himmelreich appealed that ruling. The Sixth\nCircuit reversed, holding that the judgment bar provision did not\napply to Himmelreich\u2019s suit.Himmelreichv.Federal\nBureau of Prisons et al.,766 F.\u00a03d 576 (2014)(per\ncuriam).We granted certiorari to resolve a Circuit split\non whether the judgment bar provision applies to suits that, like\nHimmelreich\u2019s, are dismissed as falling within an \u201cExceptio[n]\u201d to\nthe FTCA.[1] 577 U.\u00a0S. ___\n(2015).BThe FTCA\u2019s provisions are contained in two\nareas of the United States Code. One, 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a71346(b), gives federal district courts exclusive jurisdiction over\ntort claims against the United States for the acts of its employees\n\u201c[s]ubject to the provisions of chapter 171\u201d of Title 28.[2] Chapter 171, in turn, is labeled\n\u201cTort Claims Procedure\u201d and comprises the remaining provisions of\nthe FTCA. \u00a7\u00a72671\u20132680.Chapter 171 contains an array of provisions.\nSome provisions govern how FTCA claims are to be adjudicated. See,e.g.,\u00a72674 (specifying scope of United States\u2019 liability);\n\u00a72675(a) (exhaustion requirement); \u00a72678 (restricting attorney\u2019s\nfees). Other provisions limit plaintiffs\u2019 remedies outside the\nFTCA. See,e.g.,\u00a72679(a) (cannot sue agency for claims\nwithin scope of FTCA); \u00a72679(d)(1) (suit against federal employee\nacting within scope of employment automatically converted to FTCA\naction).The District Court in this case relied on one\nsuchremedies-limiting provision of Chapter 171, the judgment bar\nprovision.[3] See \u00a72676. Under\nthe judgment bar provision, once a plaintiff receives a judgment\n(favorable or not) in an FTCA suit, he generally cannot proceed\nwith a suit against an individual employee based on the same\nunderlying facts. The District Court below held that Himmelreich\nhad received a judgment in the first suit (the FTCA suit against\nthe United States) and so could not proceed with the second suit\n(the individual employee suit based on the same underlying\nfacts).The FTCA explicitly excepts from its coverage\ncertain categories of claims, including the one into which\nHimmelreich\u2019s first suit fell:\u201cExceptions\u201cThe provisions of this chapter and section\n1346(b) of this title shall not apply to\u2014\u201c(a) Any claim based upon .\u00a0.\u00a0. the\nexercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a\ndiscretionary function or duty .\u00a0.\u00a0. whether or not the\ndiscretion involved be abused.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d \u00a72680.\u201cThe provisions of this chapter\u201d referenced in\nthe first line are the provisions of Chapter 171. \u201c[S]ection\n1346(b) of this title\u201d is the provision giving district courts FTCA\njurisdiction. And the \u201cExceptions\u201d to which those portions of the\nFTCA \u201cshall not apply\u201d are 13 categories of claims, such as any\nclaim that\u2014like Himmelreich\u2019s first suit\u2014arises from the\nperformance of a \u201cdiscretionary function,\u201d \u00a72680(a); \u201c[a]ny claim\narising in a foreign country,\u201d \u00a72680(k); and \u201c[a]ny claim arising\nfrom the activities of the Tennessee Valley Authority,\u201d\n\u00a72680(l).Both parties agree that district courts do not\nhave jurisdiction over claims that fall into one of the 13\ncategories of \u201cExceptions\u201d because \u201csection 1346(b) of this\ntitle\u201d\u2014the provision conferring jurisdiction on district\ncourts\u2014does \u201cnot apply\u201d to such claims. Both parties also agree\nthat at least one of \u201c[t]he provisions of [Chapter 171]\u201d\u2014the\nprovision delimiting the United States\u2019 liability, \u00a72674\u2014need \u201cnot\napply\u201d to claims in the \u201cExceptions\u201d categories because no court\nwill have jurisdiction to hold the United States liable on such\nclaims in any event.The parties disagree, however, about whether the\njudgment bar provision of Chapter 171 \u201cshall not apply\u201d to claims\nin one of the \u201cExceptions\u201d categories. The Government maintains\nthat the judgment bar provision does apply to such claims. In that\ncase, it applied to Himmelreich\u2019s first suit and would preclude any\nfuture actions, including his second suit. Himmelreich urges that\nit does not apply. On that reading, there is no reason he cannot\nproceed with his second suit.IIHimmelreich is correct. The \u201cExceptions\u201d\nsection of the FTCA reads: \u201c[T]he provisions of this\nchapter\u201d\u2014Chapter 171\u2014\u201cshall not apply to .\u00a0.\u00a0. [a]ny\nclaim based upon .\u00a0.\u00a0. the exercise or performance\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. [of] a discretionary function or duty.\u201d \u00a72680(a).\nThe judgment bar is a provision of Chapter 171; the plain text of\nthe \u201cExceptions\u201d section therefore dictates that it does \u201cnot\napply\u201d to cases that, like Himmelreich\u2019s first suit, are based on\nthe performance of a discretionary function. Because the judgment\nbar provision does not apply to Himmelreich\u2019s first suit,\nHimmelreich\u2019s second suit\u2014the one against individual prison\nemployees\u2014should be permitted to go forward.Absent persuasive indications to the contrary,\nwe presume Congress says what it means and means what it says.\nNothing about the \u201cExceptions\u201d section or the judgment bar\nprovision gives us any reason to doubt the plain-text result in\nthis case.IIIAGiven the clarity of the \u201cExceptions\u201d\nsection\u2019s command, a reader might be forgiven for wondering how\nthere could be any confusion about the statute\u2019s operation. The\nmain source of uncertainty on this score, the Government submits,\nisUnited Statesv.Smith, 499 U. S. 160 (1991) . InSmith, we considered another provision of Chapter 171, the\nexclusive remedies provision.Id., at 162. Under the\nexclusive remedies provision, a plaintiff generally cannot sue an\nemployee where the FTCA would allow him to sue the United States\ninstead. See \u00a72679(b)(1).[4]TheSmithCourt held that this exclusive\nremedies provision applied to a claim for injuries sustained at an\nArmy hospital in Italy, even though that claim fell within the\ncategory of \u201c[a]ny claim arising in a foreign country,\u201d one of the\n\u201cExceptions\u201d to which \u201cthe provisions of [Chapter 171]\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. shall not apply.\u201d \u00a72680(k). The Government argues\nthat our literal reading of the \u201cExceptions\u201d provision would\nforecloseSmith\u2019s outcome because theSmithCourt\napplied a provision of Chapter 171 (the exclusive remedies\nprovision) to a claim falling within one of the \u201cExceptions\u201d\ncategories (a claim arising in a foreign country).Smith,\nthe Government argues, thus establishes that we cannot read the\ncommand of the \u201cExceptions\u201d section literally and that the judgment\nbar provision therefore should apply to Himmelreich\u2019s discretionary\nfunction claim.The Government\u2019s position has some force.\nNonetheless,Smithdoes not control this case. First,Smithdoes not even cite, let alone discuss, the \u201cshall not\napply\u201d language \u201cExceptions\u201d provision. Second, the exclusive\nremedies provision at issue inSmithwas enacted as part of\nthe Federal Employee Liability Reform and Tort Compensation Act of\n1988, which contained a mechanism to reduce the number of tort\nsuits against Government employees. As theSmithCourt\nexplained, if \u201cthe Attorney General . . . certif[ies] that a\nGovernment employee named as defendant was acting within the scope\nof his employment when he committed the alleged tort,\u201d the\nLiability Reform Act dictates that the United States be substituted\nas the sole defendant, and that the action \u201c\u00a0\u2018shall proceed in\nthe same manner\u2019\u00a0\u201d as an FTCA action \u201c\u00a0\u2018and shall be\nsubject to thelimitations and exceptionsapplicable to\nthose actions.\u2019\u00a0\u201d 499 U. S., at 166 (quoting \u00a72679(d)(4));\n(emphasis inSmith). TheSmithCourt held that the\nLiability Reform Act\u2019s reference to \u201climitations and exceptions\u201d\nwas most naturally read to refer to the \u201cExceptions\u201d section of the\nFTCA. And by taking note of the \u201cExceptions\u201d section, theSmithcourt reasoned, the Liability Reform Act was intended\nto apply to those \u201cExceptions.\u201dIn light of the unique language of the Liability\nReform Act,Smithis distinguishable from this case. Nothing\nin the text of the judgment bar provision compels the same\nresult.BThe Government\u2019s remaining counterargument\namounts to a parade of horribles that it believes will come to pass\nifeveryprovision of Chapter 171 \u201cshall not apply\u201d to the\n\u201cExceptions\u201d categories of claims. See Brief for Petitioners 52. If\nthe Government is right about the other provisions of Chapter 171,\nthe Court may hold so in the appropriate case. SeeSmith,\n499 U.\u00a0S., at 175. But this case deals only with the judgment\nbar provision, and, aside from a passing concern about duplicative\nlitigation, the Government does not argue that any such cavalcade\nwould follow ifthatprovision does not apply to the\nexcepted claims. It is enough for our purposes that the statute\u2019s\nclear directive would not lead to hard-to-explain results when\napplied to the judgment bar provision in particular.To the contrary, our holding that the judgment\nbar provision \u201cshall not apply\u201d to the categories of claims in the\n\u201cExceptions\u201d section in fact allows the statute to operate in an\nutterly sensible manner. Ordinarily, the judgment bar provision\nprevents unnecessarily duplicative litigation. If the District\nCourt in this case had issued a judgment dismissing Himmelreich\u2019s\nfirst suit because the prison employees were not negligent, because\nHimmelreich was not harmed, or because Himmelreich simply failed to\nprove his claim, it would make little sense to give Himmelreich a\nsecond bite at the money-damages apple by allowing suit against the\nemployees: Himmelreich\u2019s first suit would have given him a fair\nchance to recover dam-ages for his beating.Where an FTCA claim is dismissed because it\nfalls within one of the \u201cExceptions,\u201d by contrast, the judgment bar\nprovision makes much less sense. The dismissal of a claim in the\n\u201cExceptions\u201d section signals merely that the United States cannot\nbe held liable for a particular claim; it has no logical bearing on\nwhether an employee can be held liable instead.[5] To apply the judgment bar so as to foreclose a\nfuture suit against an employee thus would be passing strange.The Government\u2019s reading would yield another\nstrange result. According to the Government, the viability of a\nplaintiff\u2019s meritorious suit against an individual employee should\nturn on the order in which the suits are filed (or the order in\nwhich the district court chooses to address motions). For example,\nhad the District Court in this case addressed the individual\nemployee suit first, there would be no FTCA judgment in the\npicture, and so the judgment bar provision would not affect the\noutcome of the suit. The Government\u2019s reading would thus encourage\nlitigants to file suit against individual employees before suing\nthe United States to avoid being foreclosed from recovery\naltogether. Yet this result is at odds with one of the FTCA\u2019s\npurposes, channeling liability away from individual employees and\ntoward the United States. SeeDalehitev.United\nStates, 346 U.\u00a0S. 15, 25 (1953) .We decline to ignore the text of the statute to\nachieve these imprudently restrictive results. Accordingly, we read\n\u201c[t]he provisions of this chapter .\u00a0.\u00a0. shall not apply\u201d\nas it was written. The judgment bar provision\u2014one of the\n\u201cprovisions of this chapter\u201d\u2014does not apply to the categories of\nclaims in the \u201cExceptions\u201d sections of the FTCA. We therefore\naffirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.Notes1SeeHallockv.Bonner, 387 F.\u00a03d 147 (CA2 2004), vacated on other\ngroundssub\u00a0nom. Willv. Hallock, 546 U.\u00a0S.\n345 (2006) ;Pesnellv.Arsenault, 543 F.\u00a03d\n1038 (CA9 2008);Williamsv.Fleming, 597 F.\u00a03d\n820, 823\u2013824 (CA7 2010).2The precise claims at\nissue are \u201cclaims against the United States, for money damages,\naccruing on and after January 1, 1945, for injury or loss of\nproperty, or personal injury or death caused by the negligent or\nwrongful act or omission of any employee of the Government while\nacting within the scope of his office or employment, under\ncircum-stances where the United States, if a private person, would\nbe liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place\nwhere the act or omission occurred.\u201d 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a71346(b).3It reads in full: \u201cThe\njudgment in an action under section 1346(b) of this title shall\nconstitute a complete bar to any action by the claimant, by reason\nof the same subject matter, against the employee of the Government\nwhose act or omission gave rise to the claim.\u201d \u00a72676.4There is an exception to\nthis provision for suits alleging constitutional violations. See\n\u00a72679(b)(2)(A). Himmelreich\u2019s second suit\u2014the one against\nindividual prison employees\u2014alleged a violation of the Constitution\nand so was not foreclosed by the exclusive remedies\nprovision.5This conclusion is\nbuttressed by analogy to the common-law doctrine of claim\npreclusion, which prevents duplicative litigation by barring one\nparty from again suing the other over the same underlying facts.\nThis Court has said that the judgment bar provision \u201cfunctions in\nmuch the same way\u201d as that doctrine.Will, 546 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 354. (The judgment bar provision supplements common-law claim\npreclusion by closing a narrow gap: At the time that the FTCA was\npassed, common-law claim preclusion would have barred a plaintiff\nfrom suing the United States after having sued an employee but not\nvice versa. See Restatement of Judgments \u00a7\u00a799, 96(1)(a), Commentsbandd(1942). The judgment bar provision applies\nwhere a plaintiff first sues the United States and then sues an\nemployee.)",
