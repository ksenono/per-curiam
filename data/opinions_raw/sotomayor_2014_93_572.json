UNITED STATESon writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the tenth circuit[March 10, 2014]Justice Sotomayor,\ndissenting.The Court bases today\u2019s\nholding almost entirely on Great Northern R. Co. v. United States,\n315 U. S. 262, 271 (1942) , and its conclusion that the General\nRailroad Right-of-Way Act of 1875 granted \u201conly an easement, and\nnot a fee,\u201d to a railroad possessing a right of way. The Court\nerrs, however, in two ways. First, it does not meaningfully grapple\nwith prior cases\u2014Northern Pacific R. Co. v. Townsend, 190 U. S.\n267, 271 (1903) , and Rio Grande Western R. Co. v. Stringham, 239\nU.\u00a0S. 44, 47 (1915) \u2014that expressly concluded that the United\nStates retained a reversionary interest in railroad rights of way.\nTo the extent the Court regards Great Northern as having abrogated\nthese precedents, it places on Great Northern more weight than that\ncase will bear. Second, the Court relies on \u201cbasic common law\nprinciples,\u201d ante, at 12, without recognizing that courts have long\ntreated railroad rights of way as sui generis property rights not\ngoverned by the ordinary common-law regime. Because Townsend and\nStringham largely dictate the conclusion that the Government\nretained a reversionary interest when it granted the right of way\nat issue, and because any ambiguity in land grants \u201cis to be\nresolved favorably to a sovereign grantor,\u201d Great Northern, 315\nU.\u00a0S., at 272, I respectfully dissent.IOver a century ago,\nthis Court held that a right of way granted to a railroad by a\npre-1871 Act of Congress included \u201can implied condition of\nreverter\u201d to the Government if the right of way ceased to be used\n\u201cfor the purpose for which it was granted.\u201d Northern Pacific R. Co.\nv. Townsend, 190 U. S. 267, 271 (1903) . The question in Townsend\nwas whether individual homesteaders could acquire title by adverse\npossession to land granted by the United States as a railroad right\nof way. The Court held that they could not, because \u201cthe land\nforming the right of way was not granted with the intent that it\nmight be absolutely disposed of at the volition of the company.\u201d\nIbid. \u201cOn the contrary,\u201d the Court held, \u201cthe grant was explicitly\nstated to be for a designated purpose, one which negated the\nexistence of the power to voluntarily alienate the right of way or\nany portion thereof.\u201d Ibid. Hence the \u201cimplied condition of\nreverter in the event that the com-pany ceased to use or retain the\nland for the purpose for which it was granted.\u201d Ibid. In essence,\nthe Court held, \u201cthe grant was of a limited fee,\u201d ibid.\u2014commonly\nknown as a defeasible fee, see Restatement (First) of Property \u00a716\n(1936)\u2014rather than fee simple. Thus, if the railroad were to\nabandon its use of the right of way, the property would revert to\nthe United States.The Court later\nconfirmed in Rio Grande Western R. Co. v. Stringham, 239 U. S. 44,\n47 (1915) , that this rule applies not just to pre-1871 land grants\nto railroads, but also to rights of way granted under the General\nRailroad Right-of-Way Act\u2014the Act under which the United States\ngranted the right of way at issue in this case. That case stated\nthat rights of way granted under the 1875 Act are \u201cmade on an\nimplied condition of reverter in the event that the company ceases\nto use or retain the land for the purposes for which it is\ngranted.\u201d Ibid. Indeed, Stringhamsustained the validity of the reverter where, as\nhere, the United States patented the adjacent land \u201csubject to\n[the] right of way.\u201d Id., at 46. If Townsend and Stringham remain\ngood law on that point, then this case should be resolved in the\nGovernment\u2019s favor.IIAThis case therefore\nturns on whether, as the majority asserts, Great Northern\n\u201cdisavowed\u201d Townsend and Stringham as to the question whether the\nUnited States retained a reversionary interest in the right of way.\nAnte, at 10. Great Northern did no such thing. Nor could it have,\nfor the Court did not have occasion to consider that question.In Great Northern, a\nrailroad sought to drill for oil beneath the surface of a right of\nway granted under the 1875 Act. We held that the railroad had no\nright to drill, because the United States did not convey the\nunderlying oil and minerals when it granted the railroad a right of\nway. In language on which the Court relies heavily, Great Northern\nopined that the 1875 Act granted the railroad \u201conly an easement,\nand not a fee.\u201d 315 U.\u00a0S., at 271.But that language does\nnot logically lead to the place at which the majority ultimately\narrives. All that Great Northern held\u2014all, at least, that was\nnecessary to its ruling\u2014was that the right of way did not confer\none particular attribute of fee title. Specifically, the Court\nheld, the right of way did not confer the right to exploit\nsubterranean resources, because the 1875 Act could not have made\nclearer that the right of way extended only to surface lands: It\nprovided that after the recordation of a right of way, \u201call\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. lands over which such right of way shall pass shall\nbe disposed of subject to such right of way.\u201d Ibid. (second\nemphasis and internal quotation marks omitted). But the Court did\nnot hold that the right of way failed to confer any sticks in the\nproverbial bundle of rights generally associated with fee title.\nCf. B. Cardozo, The Paradoxes of Legal Science 129 (1928) (reprint\n2000); United States v. Craft, 535 U.\u00a0S. 274, 278 (2002) . And\nthis case concerns an attribute of fee title\u2014defeasibility\u2014that no\nparty contends was at issue in Great Northern.The majority places\nheavy emphasis on Great Northern\u2019s characterization of rights of\nway under the 1875 Act as \u201ceasements,\u201d rather than \u201climited fees.\u201d\nWhen an easement is abandoned, the majority reasons, it is\nextinguished; in effect, it reverts to the owner of the underlying\nestate, rather than to its original grantor. Ante, at 11\u201312. For\nthat reason, the majority concludes, \u201cbasic common law principles\u201d\nrequire us to retreat from our prior holdings that railroad rights\nof way entail an implied possibility of reverter to the original\ngrantor\u2014the United States\u2014should the right of way cease to be used\nby a railroad for its intended purpose. Ante, at 12.But federal and state\ndecisions in this area have not historically depended on \u201cbasic\ncommon law principles.\u201d To the contrary, this Court and others have\nlong recognized that in the context of railroad rights of way,\ntraditional property terms like \u201cfee\u201d and \u201ceasement\u201d do not neatly\ntrack common-law definitions. In Stringham, the Court articulated\nways in which rights of ways bear attributes both of easements and\nfees, explaining that \u201c[t]he right of way granted by [the 1875 Act]\nand similar acts is neither a mere easement, nor a fee simple\nabsolute.\u201d 239 U.\u00a0S., at 47. In New Mexico v. United States\nTrust Co., 172 U.\u00a0S. 171 \u2013183 (1898), the Court further\nobserved that even if a particular right of way granted by the\nUnited States was an \u201ceasement,\u201d then it was \u201csurely morethan an\nordinary easement\u201d because it had \u201cattributes of the fee\u201d like\nexclusive use and possession. See also Western Union Telegraph Co.\nv. Pennsylvania R. Co., 195 U.\u00a0S. 540 \u2013570 (1904) (reaffirming\nthis view). Earlier, in 1854, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial\nCourt had explained that although the right acquired by a railroad\nwas \u201ctechnically an easement,\u201d it \u201crequire[d] for its enjoyment a\nuse of the land permanent in its nature and practically exclusive.\u201d\nHazen v. Boston and Me. R.\u00a0Co., 68 Mass. 574, 580 (1854). And\nthe Iowa Supreme Court, in a late 19th-century opinion, observed\nthat \u201c[t]he easement\u201d in question \u201cis not that spoken of in the old\nlaw books, but is peculiar to the use of a railroad.\u201d Smith v.\nHall, 103 Iowa 95, 96, 72 N.\u00a0W. 427, 428 (1897).Today\u2019s opinion\ndispenses with these teachings. Al-though the majority canvasses\nthe special role railroads played in the development of our Nation,\nit concludes that we are bound by the common-law definitions that\napply to more typical property. In doing so, it ignores the sui\ngeneris nature of railroad rights of way. That Great Northern\nreferred to a right of way granted under the 1875 Act as an\n\u201ceasement\u201d does not derail the Court\u2019s previous unequivocal\npronouncements that rights of way under the Act are \u201cmade on an\nimplied condition of re-verter.\u201d Stringham, 239 U.\u00a0S., at\n47.BNot only does Great\nNorthern fail to support the major-ity\u2019s conclusion; significant\naspects of Great Northern\u2019s reasoning actually support the contrary\nview. In that case, the Court relied heavily on Congress\u2019 policy\nshift in the early 1870\u2019s away from bestowing extravagant\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018subsidies in public lands to railroads and other\ncorporations.\u2019\u00a0\u201d 315 U.\u00a0S., at 273\u2013274 (quoting Cong.\nGlobe, 42d Cong., 2d Sess., 1585 (1872)). That history similarly\nweighs in the Government\u2019s favor here. Just as the post-1871\nCongress did not likely mean to confer subsurface mineral rights on\nrailroads, as held in Great Northern, it did not likely mean to\ngrant railroads an indefeasible property interest in rights of\nway\u2014a kind of interest more generous than that which it gave in our\ncases concerning pre-1871 grants.As in Great Northern,\nmoreover, the purpose of the 1875 Act supports the Government.\nCongress passed the Act, we noted, \u201cto permit the construction of\nrailroads through public lands\u201d and thus to \u201cenhance their value\nand hasten their settlement.\u201d 315 U.\u00a0S., at 272. In Great\nNorthern, we held, that purpose did not require granting to the\nrailroad any right to that which lay beneath the surface. The same\nis true here. As we recognized in Townsend and Stringham, the\nUnited States granted rights of way to railroads subject to \u201can\nimplied condition of reverter in the event that the\u201d railroads\n\u201ccease[d] to use or retain the land for the purposes for which it\nis granted.\u201d Stringham, 239 U.\u00a0S., at 47. Nothing about the\npurpose of the 1875 Act suggests Congress ever meant to abandon\nthat sensible limitation.Further, Great Northern\nrelied on the conventional rule that \u201ca grant is to be resolved\nfavorably to a sovereign grantor,\u201d 315 U.\u00a0S., at 272, and that\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018nothing passes but what is conveyed in clear and explicit\nlanguage,\u2019\u00a0\u201d ibid. (quoting Caldwell v. United States, 250\nU.\u00a0S. 14, 20 (1919) ). \u201cNothing in the [1875] Act,\u201d we\nobserved, \u201cmay be characterized as a \u2018clear and explicit\u2019\nconveyance of the .\u00a0.\u00a0. oil and minerals\u201d underlying a\nright of way. 315 U.\u00a0S.,at 272. Just so here, as nothing in\nthe 1875 Act clearly evinces Congress\u2019 intent not to make the\nrights of way conveyed under the Act defeasible, in the manner\ndescribed by Townsend and Stringham. In fact, the presumption in\nfavor of sovereign grantors applies doubly here, where the United\nStates was the sovereign grantor both of the right of way and of\nthe ultimate patent.IIIThe majority notes\nthat in Great Northern, the United States took the position that\nrights of way granted to railroads are easements. Ante, at 9. In\nthe majority\u2019s view, because the Great Northern Court adopted that\nposition \u201cin full,\u201d it is unfair for the Government to backtrack on\nthat position now. Ante, at 9.Even assuming that it\nis an injustice for the Government to change positions on an issue\nover a 70-year period, it is not clear that such a change in\nposition happened here. Yes, the Government argued in Great\nNorthern that a right of way was an \u201ceasement.\u201d It proposed,\nhowever, that the right of way may well have had \u201csome of the\nattributes of a fee.\u201d Brief for United States in Great Northern R.\nCo. v. United States, O. T. 1941, No. 149, pp.\u00a036\u201337. The\nGovernment contended that it is \u201c\u00a0\u2018not important whether the\ninterest or estate passed be considered an easement or a limited\nfee,\u2019\u00a0\u201d observing that an easement \u201cmay be held in fee\ndeterminable.\u201d Id., at 35\u201336 (quoting United States v. Big Horn\nLand & Cattle Co., 17 F.\u00a02d 357, 365 (CA8 1927)). Indeed,\nthe Government expressly reserved the possibility that it retained\na reversionary interest in the right of way, even if the\nsurrounding land was patented to others. Brief for United States in\nGreat Northern, at 10 n. 4. The Court is right to criticize the\nGovernment when it takes \u201cself-serving\u201d and contradictory\npositions, ante, at 12, but such critique is misplaced here.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*Since 1903, this Court\nhas held that rights of way were granted to railroads with an\nimplied possibility of reverter to the United States. Regardless of\nwhether these rights of way are labeled \u201ceasements\u201d or \u201cfees,\u201d\nnothing in Great Northern overruled that conclusion. By changing\ncourse today, the Court undermines the legality of thousands of\nmiles of former rights of way that the public now enjoys as means\nof transportation and recreation. And lawsuits challenging the\nconversion of former rails to recreational trails alone may well\ncost American taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars.[1] I do not believe the law requires\nthis result, and I respectfully dissent.Notes1Dept. of Justice,\nEnvironment and Natural Resources Div., FY2014 Performance Budget,\nCongressional Submission, p. 7,\nhttp://www.justice.gov/jmd/2014justification/pdf/enrd-justification.pdf\n(visited Mar. 7, 2014, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case\nfile).",
