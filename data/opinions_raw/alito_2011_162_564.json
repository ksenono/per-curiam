    "text": "OPINION OF THE COURTUNITED STATES V. JICARILLA APACHE NATION564 U. S. ____ (2011)SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESNO. 10-382UNITED STATES, PETITIONERv.JICARILLA\nAPACHE NATIONon writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the federal circuit[June 13, 2011]Justice Alito delivered the\nopinion of the Court.The attorney-client privilege\nranks among the oldest and most established evidentiary privileges\nknown to our law. The common law, however, has recognized an\nexception to the privilege when a trustee obtains legal advice\nrelated to the exercise of fiduciary duties. In such cases, courts\nhave held, the trustee cannot withhold attorney-client\ncommunications from the beneficiary of the trust.In this case, we consider whether the\nfiduciary exception applies to the general trust relationship\nbetween the United States and the Indian tribes. We hold that it\ndoes not. Although the Government\u2019s responsibilities with re-spect\nto the management of funds belonging to Indian tribes bear some\nresemblance to those of a private trustee, this analogy cannot be\ntaken too far. The trust obligations of the United States to the\nIndian tribes are established and governed by statute rather than\nthe common law, and in fulfilling its statutory duties, the\nGovernment acts not as a private trustee but pursuant to its\nsovereign interest in the execution of federal law. The reasons for\nthe fiduciary exception\u2014that the trustee has no independent\ninterest in trust administration, and that the trustee is subject\nto a general common-law duty of disclosure\u2014do not apply in this\ncontext.IThe Jicarilla Apache Nation\n(Tribe) occupies a 900,000-acre reservation in northern New Mexico\nthat was established by Executive Order in 1887. The land contains\ntimber, gravel, and oil and gas reserves, which are developed\npursuant to statutes administered by the Department of the\nInterior. Proceeds derived from these natural resources are held by\nthe United States in trust for the Tribe pursuant to the American\nIndian Trust Fund Management Reform Act of 1994, 108 Stat. 4239,\nand other statutes.In 2002, the Tribe commenced a\nbreach-of-trust action against the United States in the Court of\nFederal Claims (CFC). The Tribe sued under the Tucker Act, 28 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a71491 (2006 ed. and Supp. III), and the Indian Tucker\nAct, \u00a71505, which vest the CFC with jurisdiction over claims\nagainst the Government that are founded on the Constitution, laws,\ntreaties, or contracts of the United States. The complaint seeks\nmonetary damages for the Government\u2019s alleged mismanagement of\nfunds held in trust for the Tribe. The Tribe argues that the\nGovernment violated various laws, including 25 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a7161a\nand 162a, that govern the management of funds held in trust for\nIndian tribes. See 88 Fed.\u00a0Cl. 1, 3 (2009).From December 2002 to June 2008, the\nGovernment and the Tribe participated in alternative dispute\nresolution in order to resolve the claim. During that time, the\nGovernment turned over thousands of documents but withheld 226\npotentially relevant documents as protected by the attorney-client\nprivilege, the attorney work-product doctrine, or the\ndeliberative-process privilege.In 2008, at the request of the Tribe, the case\nwas restored to the active litigation docket. The CFC divided the\ncase into phases for trial and set a discovery schedule. The first\nphase, relevant here, concerns the Government\u2019s management of the\nTribe\u2019s trust accounts from 1972 to 1992. The Tribe alleges that\nduring this period the Government failed to invest its trust funds\nproperly. Among other things, the Tribe claims the Government\nfailed to maximize returns on its trust funds, invested too heavily\nin short-term maturities, and failed to pool its trust funds with\nother tribal trusts. During discovery, the Tribe moved to compel\nthe Government to produce the 226 withheld documents. In response,\nthe Government agreed to withdraw its claims of\ndeliberative-process privilege and, accordingly, to produce 71 of\nthe documents. But the Government continued to assert the\nattorney-client privilege and attorney work-product doctrine with\nrespect to the remaining 155 documents. The CFC reviewed those\ndocumentsin cameraand classified them into five\ncate-gories: (1) requests for legal advice relating to trust\nadministration sent by personnel at the Department of the Interior\nto the Office of the Solicitor, which directs legal affairs for the\nDepartment, (2) legal advice sent from the Solicitor\u2019s Office to\npersonnel at the Interior and Treas- ury Departments, (3) documents\ngenerated under contracts between Interior and an accounting firm,\n(4) Interior documents concerning litigation with other tribes, and\n(5) miscellaneous documents not falling into the other\ncategories.The CFC granted the Tribe\u2019s motion to compel\nin part. The CFC held that communications relating to the\nmanagement of trust funds fall within a \u201cfiduciary exception\u201d to\nthe attorney-client privilege. Under that exception, which courts\nhave applied in the context of common-law trusts, a trustee who\nobtains legal advice related to the execution of fiduciary\nobligations is precluded from asserting the attorney-client\nprivilege against beneficiaries of the trust. The CFC concluded\nthat the trust relationship between the United States and the\nIndian tribes is sufficiently analogous to a common-law trust\nrelationship that the exception should apply. Accordingly, the CFC\nheld, the United States may not shield from the Tribe\ncommunications with attorneys relating to trust matters.The CFC ordered disclosure of almost all\ndocuments in the first two categories because those documents\n\u201cinvolve matters regarding the administration of tribal trusts,\neither directly or indirectly implicating the investments that\nbenefit Jicarilla\u201d and contain \u201clegal advice relating to trust\nadministration.\u201dId., at 14\u201315. The CFC allowed the\nGovernment to withhold most of the documents in the remaining\ncategories as attorney work product,[Footnote 1] but the court identified some individual\ndocuments that it determined were also subject to the fiduciary\nexception.Id., at 18\u201319.The Government sought to prevent disclosure of\nthe documents by petitioning the Court of Appeals for the Federal\nCircuit for a writ of mandamus directing the CFC to vacate its\nproduction order. The Court of Appeals denied the petition because,\nin its view, the CFC correctly applied the fiduciary exception. The\ncourt held that \u201cthe United States cannot deny an Indian tribe\u2019s\nrequest to discover communications between the United States and\nits attorneys based on the attorney-client privilege when those\ncommunications concern management of an Indian trust and the United\nStates has not claimed that the government or its attorneys\nconsidered a specific com-peting interest in those communications.\u201dIn re United States, 590 F.\u00a03d 1305, 1313 (CA Fed.\n2009). In qualifying its holding, the court recognized that\nsometimes the Government may have other statutory obligations that\nclash with its fiduciary duties to the Indian tribes. But because\nthe Government had not alleged that the legal advice in this case\nrelated to such conflicting interests, the court reserved judgment\non how the fiduciary exception might apply in that situation. The\ncourt rejected the Government\u2019s argument that, because its duties\nto the Indian tribes were governed by statute rather than the\ncommon law, it had no general duty of disclosure that would\noverride the attorney-client privilege. The court also disagreed\nwith the Government\u2019s contention that a case-by-case approach made\nthe attorney-client privilege too unpredictable and would impair\nthe Government\u2019s ability to obtain confidential legal advice.We granted certiorari, 562 U. S. ___\n(2011),[Footnote 2] and now\nreverse and remand for further proceedings.IIThe Federal Rules of Evidence\nprovide that evidentiary privileges \u201cshall be governed by the\nprinciples of the common law \u2026 in the light of reason and\nexperience.\u201d Fed. Rule Evid. 501. The attorney-client privilege \u201cis\nthe oldest of the privileges for confidential communications known\nto the common law.\u201dUpjohn Co.v.United States,449 U. S. 383,\n389 (1981) (citing 8 J. Wigmore, Evidence \u00a72290 (J. McNaughton rev.\n1961)). Its aim is \u201cto encourage full and frank communication\nbetween attorneys and their clients and thereby promote broader\npublic interests in the observance of law and administration of\njustice.\u201d 449 U. S., at 389;Huntv.Blackburn,128 U. S. 464,\n470 (1888).The objectives of the\nattorney-client privilege apply to governmental clients. \u201cThe\nprivilege aids government en-tities and employees in obtaining\nlegal advice founded on a complete and accurate factual picture.\u201d 1\nRestatement (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers \u00a774, Commentb,pp. 573\u2013574 (1998). Unless applicable law provides\nother-wise, the Government may invoke the attorney-client privilege\nin civil litigation to protect confidential communications between\nGovernment officials and Government attorneys.Id., at 574\n(\u201c[G]overnmental agencies and employees enjoy the same privilege as\nnongovernmental counterparts\u201d). The Tribe argues, however, that the\ncommon law also recognizes a fiduciary exception to the\nattorney-client privilege and that, by virtue of the trust\nrelationship between the Government and the Tribe, documents that\nwould otherwise be privileged must be disclosed. As preliminary\nmatters, we consider the bounds of the fiduciary exception and the\nnature of the trust relationship between the United States and the\nIndian tribes.AEnglish courts first developed\nthe fiduciary exception as a principle of trust law in the 19th\ncentury. The rule was that when a trustee obtained legal advice to\nguide the administration of the trust, and not for the trustee\u2019s\nown defense in litigation, the beneficiaries were entitled to the\nproduction of documents related to that advice.Wynnev.Humberston,27 Beav. 421, 423\u2013424, 54 Eng.\u00a0Rep. 165,\n166 (1858);Talbotv.Marshfield2 Dr. & Sm.\n549, 550\u2013551, 62 Eng.\u00a0Rep. 728, 729 (1865). The courts\nreasoned that the normal attorney-client privilege did not apply in\nthis situation because the legal advice was sought for the\nbeneficiaries\u2019 benefit and was obtained at the beneficiaries\u2019\nexpense by using trust funds to pay the attorney\u2019s fees.Ibid.;Wynne,supra, at 423\u2013424, 54 Eng.\nRep., at 166.The fiduciary exception quickly\nbecame an established feature of English common law, see,e.g.,In re Mason, 22 Ch.\u00a0D. 609 (1883), but\nit did not appear in this country until the following century.\nAmerican courts seem first to have expressed skepticism. SeeIn\nre Prudence-Bonds Corp., 76 F.\u00a0Supp. 643, 647 (EDNY 1948)\n(declining to apply the fiduciary exception to the trustee of a\nbondholding corporation because of the \u201cimportant right of such a\ncorporate trustee \u2026 to seek legal advice and nevertheless act in\naccordance with its own judgment\u201d). By the 1970\u2019s, however,\nAmerican courts began to adopt the English common-law rule. SeeGarnerv.Wolfinbarger, 430 F.\u00a02d 1093,\n1103\u20131104 (CA5 1970) (allowing shareholders, upon a showing of\n\u201cgood cause,\u201d to discover legal advice given to corporate\nmanagement).[Footnote 3]The leading American case on the fiduciary\nexception isRiggs Nat. Bank of Washington, D.\u00a0C.v.Zimmer, 355 A.\u00a02d 709 (Del. Ch. 1976). In that case,\nthe beneficiaries of a trust estate sought to compel the trustees\nto reimburse the estate for alleged breaches of trust. The\nbeneficiaries moved to compel the trustees to produce a legal\nmemorandum related to the administration of the trust that the\ntrustees withheld on the basis of attorney-client privilege. The\nDelaware Chancery Court, observing that \u201cAmerican case law is\npractically nonexistent on the duty of a trustee in this context,\u201d\nlooked to the English cases.Id., at 712. Applying the\ncommon-law fiduciary exception, the court held that the memorandum\nwas discoverable. It identified two reasons for applying the\nexception.First, the court explained, the trustees had\nobtained the legal advice as \u201cmere representative[s]\u201d of the\nbeneficiaries because the trustees had a fiduciary obligation to\nact in the beneficiaries\u2019 interest when administering the trust.Ibid.For that reason, the beneficiaries were the \u201creal\nclients\u201d of the attorney who had advised the trustee on\ntrust-related matters, and therefore the attorney-client privilege\nproperly belonged to the beneficiaries rather than the trustees.Id., at 711\u2013712. The court based its \u201creal client\u201d\ndetermination on several factors: (1) when the advice was sought,\nno adversarial proceedings between the trustees and beneficiaries\nhad been pending, and therefore there was no reason for the\ntrustees to seek legal advice in a personal rather than a fiduciary\ncapacity; (2) the court saw no indication that the memorandum was\nintended for any purpose other than to benefit the trust; and (3)\nthe law firm had been paid out of trust assets. That the advice was\nobtained at the beneficiaries\u2019 expense was not only a \u201csignificant\nfactor\u201d entitling the beneficiaries to see the document but also \u201ca\nstrong indication of precisely who the real clients were.\u201dId., at 712. The court distinguished between \u201clegal advice\nprocured at the trustee\u2019sownexpense and for hisownprotection,\u201d which would remain privileged, \u201cand the\nsituation where the trust itself is assessed for obtaining opinions\nof counsel where interests of the beneficiaries are presently at\nstake.\u201dIbid.In the latter case, the fiduciary exception\napplied, and the trustees could not withhold those attorney-client\ncommunications from the beneficiaries.Second, the court concluded that the trustees\u2019\nfiduciary duty to furnish trust-related information to the\nbenefi-ciaries outweighed their interest in the attorney-client\nprivilege. \u201cThe policy of preserving the full disclosure necessary\nin the trustee-beneficiary relationship,\u201d the court explained, \u201cis\nhere ultimately more important than the protection of the trustees\u2019\nconfidence in the attorney for the trust.\u201dId., at 714.\nBecause more information helped the beneficiaries to police the\ntrustees\u2019 management of the trust, disclosure was, in the court\u2019s\njudgment, \u201ca weight-ier public policy than the preservation of\nconfidential attorney-client communications.\u201dIbid.The Federal Courts of Appeals apply the\nfiduciary exception based on the same two criteria. See,e.g.,In re Long Island Lighting Co., 129\nF.\u00a03d 268, 272 (CA2 1997);Wachtelv.Health Net,\nInc., 482 F.\u00a03d 225, 233\u2013234 (CA3 2007);Solisv.Food Employers Labor Relations Assn., 2011 U. S. App.\nLEXIS 9110, *12 (CA4, May 4, 2011);Wildburv.Arco\nChemical Co., 974 F.\u00a02d 631, 645 (CA5 1992);United\nStatesv.Evans, 796 F.\u00a02d 264, 265\u2013266 (CA9\n1986)(per curiam). Not until the decision below had a\nfederal appellate court held the exception to apply to the United\nStates as trustee for the Indian tribes.BIn order to apply the fiduciary\nexception in this case, the Court of Appeals analogized the\nGovernment to a private trustee. 590 F.\u00a03d, at 1313. We have\napplied that analogy in limited contexts, see,e.g.,United Statesv.Mitchell,463 U. S. 206, 226\n(1983)(Mitchell II), but that does not mean the\nGovernment resembles a private trustee in every respect. On the\ncontrary, this Court has previously noted that the relationship\nbetween the United States and the Indian tribes is distinctive,\n\u201cdifferent from that existing between individuals whether dealing\nat arm\u2019s length,as trustees and beneficiaries, or\notherwise.\u201dKlamath and Moadoc Tribesv.United\nStates,296 U.\nS. 244, 254 (1935) (emphasis added). \u201cThegeneralrelationship between the United States and the Indian tribes is not\ncomparable to a private trust relationship.\u201dCherokee Nation of\nOkla.v.United States, 21 Cl.\u00a0Ct. 565, 573\n(1990) (emphasis added).The Government, of course, is not\na private trustee. Though the relevant statutes denominate the\nrelationship between the Government and the Indians a \u201ctrust,\u201d see,e.g., 25 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7162a, that trust is defined and\ngoverned by statutes rather than the common law. SeeUnited\nStatesv.Navajo Nation,537 U. S. 488, 506\n(2003)(Navajo\u00a0I)(\u201c[T]he analysis must train on\nspecific rights-creating or duty-imposing statutory or regulatory\nprescriptions\u201d). As we have recognized in prior cases, Congress may\nstyle its relations with the Indians a \u201ctrust\u201d without assuming all\nthe fiduciary duties of a private trustee, creating a trust\nrelationship that is \u201climited\u201d or \u201cbare\u201d compared to a trust\nrelationship between private parties at common law.United\nStatesv.Mitchell,445 U. S. 535, 542\n(1980)(Mitchell I);Mitchell II,supra,at 224.[Footnote 4]The difference between a private common-law\ntrust and the statutory Indian trust follows from the unique\nposition of the Government as sovereign. The distinction between\n\u201cpublic rights\u201d against the Government and \u201cprivate rights\u201d between\nprivate parties is well established. The Government consents to be\nliable to private parties \u201cand may yield this consent upon such\nterms and under such restrictions as it may think just.\u201dMurray\u2019s Lesseev.Hoboken Land & Improvement\nCo., 18 How. 272, 283 (1856). This creates an important\ndistinction \u201cbetween cases of private right and those which arise\nbetween the Government and persons subject to its authority in\nconnection with the performance of the constitutional functions of\nthe executive or legislative departments.\u201dCrowellv.Benson,285\nU. S. 22, 50 (1932).Throughout the history of the Indian trust\nrelationship, we have recognized that the organization and\nmanagement of the trust is a sovereign function subject to the\nplenary authority of Congress. SeeMerrionv.Jicarilla Apache Tribe,455 U. S. 130, 169,\nn.\u00a018 (1982) (\u201cThe United States retains plenary authority to\ndivest the tribes of any attributes of sovereignty\u201d);United\nStatesv.Wheeler,435 U. S. 313, 319\n(1978) (\u201cCongress has plenary authority to legislate for the Indian\ntribes in all matters, including their form of government\u201d);Wintonv.Amos,255 U. S. 373, 391 (1921) (\u201cCongress\nhas plenary authority over the Indians and all their tribal\nrelations, and full power to legislate concerning their tribal\nproperty\u201d);Lone Wolfv.Hitchcock,187 U. S. 553, 565\n(1903) (\u201cPlenary authority over the tribal relations of the Indians\nhas been exercised by Congress from the beginning, and the power\nhas always been deemed a political one, not subject to be\ncontrolled by the judicial department of the government\u201d);Cherokee Nationv.Hitchcock,187 U. S. 294, 308\n(1902) (\u201cThe power existing in Congress to administer upon and\nguard the tribal property, and the power being political and\nadministrative in its nature, the manner of its exercise is a\nquestion within the province of the legislative branch to\ndetermine, and is not one for the courts\u201d); see alsoUnited\nStatesv.Candelaria,271 U. S. 432, 439\n(1926);Tigerv.Western Investment Co.,221 U. S. 286, 315\n(1911).Because the Indian trust relationship\nrepresents an exercise of that authority, we have explained that\nthe Government \u201chas a real and direct interest\u201d in the guardianship\nit exercises over the Indian tribes; \u201cthe interest is one which is\nvested in it as a sovereign.\u201dUnited Statesv.Minnesota,270 U. S. 181, 194\n(1926). This is especially so because the Government has often\nstructured the trust relationship to pursue its own policy goals.\nThus, while trust administration \u201crelat[es] to the welfare of the\nIndians, the maintenance of the limitations which Congress has\nprescribed as a part of its plan of distribution is distinctly an\ninterest of the United States.\u201dHeckmanv.United\nStates,224 U.\nS. 413, 437 (1912); see alsoCandelaria,supra, at 443\u2013444.InHeckman, the Government brought\nsuit to cancel certain conveyances of allotted lands by members of\nan Indian tribe because the conveyances violated restrictions on\nalienation imposed by Congress. This Court explained that the\nGovernment brought suit as the representative of the very Indian\ngrantors whose conveyances it sought to cancel, and those Indians\nwere thereby bound by the judgment. 224 U. S., at 445\u2013446. But\nwhile it was formally acting as a trustee, the Government was in\nfact asserting its own sovereign interest in the disposition of\nIndian lands, and the Indians were precluded from intervening in\nthe litigation to advance a position contrary to that of the\nGovernment.Id., at 445. Such a result was possible\nbecause the Government assumed a fiduciary role over the Indians\nnot as a common-law trustee but as the governing authority\nenforcing statutory law.We do not question \u201cthe undisputed existence\nof a general trust relationship between the United States and the\nIndian people.\u201dMitchell II, 463 U. S., at 225. The\nGovernment, following \u201ca humane and self imposed policy \u2026 has\ncharged itself with moral obligations of the highest responsibility\nand trust,\u201dSeminole Nationv.United States,316 U. S. 286,\n296\u2013297 (1942), obligations \u201cto the fulfillment of which the\nnational honor has been committed,\u201dHeckman,supra, at 437. Congress has expressed this policy in a\nseries of statutes that have defined and redefined the trust\nrelationship between the United States and the Indian tribes. In\nsome cases, Congress established only a limited trust relationship\nto serve a narrow purpose. SeeMitchell I, 445 U. S., at\n544 (Congress intended the United States to hold land \u201c\u00a0\u2018in\ntrust\u2019\u00a0\u201d under the General Allotment Act \u201csimply because it\nwished to prevent alienation of the land and to ensure that\nallottees would be immune from state taxation\u201d);Navajo I,\n537 U. S., at 507\u2013508 (Indian Mineral Leasing Act imposes no\n\u201cdetailed fiduciary responsibilities\u201d nor is the Government\n\u201cexpressly invested with responsibility to secure \u2018the needs and\nbest interests of the Indian owner\u2019\u00a0\u201d).In other cases, we have found that particular\n\u201cstatutes and regulations \u2026 clearly establish fiduciary obligations\nof the Government\u201d in some areas.Mitchell II,supra, at 226; see alsoUnited Statesv.White Mountain Apache Tribe,537 U. S. 465, 475\n(2003). Once federal law imposes such duties, the common law \u201ccould\nplay a role.\u201dUnited Statesv.Navajo Nation, 556\nU. S. ___, ___ (2009)(Navajo II)(slip op., at 14). We\nhave looked to common-law principles to inform our interpretation\nof statutes and to determine the scope of liability that Congress\nhas imposed. SeeWhite Mountain Apache Tribe,supra, at 475\u2013476. But the applicable statutes and\nregulations \u201cestablish [the] fiduciary relationship and define the\ncontours of the United States\u2019 fiduciary responsibilities.\u201dMitchell II,supra, at 224. When \u201cthe Tribe\ncannot identify a specific, applicable, trust-creating statute or\nregulation that the Government violated, \u2026\u00a0 neither the\nGovernment\u2019s \u2018control\u2019 over [Indian assets] nor common-law trust\nprinciples matter.\u201dNavajo II,supra, at ___\n(slip op., at 14).[Footnote 5]\nThe Government assumes Indian trust responsibilities only to the\nextent it expressly accepts those responsibilities by\nstatute.[Footnote 6]Over the years, we have described the federal\nrelationship with the Indian tribes using various formulations. The\nIndian tribes have been called \u201cdomestic dependent nations,\u201dCherokee Nationv.Georgia, 5 Pet. 1, 17 (1831),\nunder the \u201ctutelage\u201d of the United States,Heckman,supra, at 444, and subject to \u201cthe exercise of the\nGovernment\u2019s guardianship over . . . their affairs,\u201dUnited\nStatesv.Sandoval,231 U. S. 28, 48 (1913).\nThese concepts do not necessarily correspond to a common-law trust\nrelationship. See,e.g., Restatement 2d, \u00a77 (\u201cA\nguardianship is not a trust\u201d). That is because Congress has chosen\nto structure the Indian trust relationship in different ways. We\nwill apply common-law trust principles where Congress has indicated\nit is appropriate to do so. For that reason, the Tribe must point\nto a right conferred by statute or regulation in order to obtain\notherwise privileged information from the Government against its\nwishes.IIIIn this case, the Tribe\u2019s claim\narises from 25 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a7161\u2013162a and the American Indian\nTrust Fund Management Reform Act of 1994, \u00a74001et seq.\nThese pro-visions define \u201cthe trust responsibilities of the United\nStates\u201d with respect to tribal funds. \u00a7162a(d). The Court of\nAppeals concluded that the trust relationship between the United\nStates and the Indian tribes, outlined in these and other statutes,\nis \u201csufficiently similar to a private trust to justify applying the\nfiduciary exception.\u201d 590 F.\u00a03d, at 1313. We disagree.As we have discussed, the\nGovernment exercises its carefully delimited trust responsibilities\nin a sovereign capacity to implement national policy respecting the\nIndian tribes. The two features justifying the fiduciary\nexception\u2014the beneficiary\u2019s status as the \u201creal client\u201d and the\ntrustee\u2019s common-law duty to disclose information about the\ntrust\u2014are notably absent in the trust relationship Congress has\nestablished between the United States and the Tribe.AThe Court of Appeals applied the\nfiduciary exception based on its determination that the Tribe\nrather than the Government was the \u201creal client\u201d with respect to\nthe Government attorneys\u2019 advice.Ibid. In cases applying\nthe fiduciary exception, courts identify the \u201creal client\u201d based on\nwhether the advice was bought by the trust corpus, whether the\ntrustee had reason to seek advice in a personal rather than a\nfiduciary capacity, and whether the advice could have been intended\nfor any purpose other than to benefit the trust.Riggs,\n355 A.\u00a02d, at 711\u2013712. Applying these factors, we conclude\nthat the United States does not obtain legal advice as a \u201cmere\nrepresentative\u201d of the Tribe; nor is the Tribe the \u201creal client\u201d\nfor whom that advice is intended. Seeibid.Here, the Government attorneys\nare paid out of congressional appropriations at no cost to the\nTribe. Courts look to the source of funds as a \u201cstrong indicator of\nprecisely who the real clients were\u201d and a \u201csignificant factor\u201d in\ndetermining who ought to have access to the legal advice.Id., at 712. We similarly find it significant that the\nattorneys were paid by the Government for advice regarding the\nGovernment\u2019s statutory obligations.The payment structure confirms our view that\nthe Government seeks legal advice in its sovereign capacity rather\nthan as a conventional fiduciary of the Tribe. Undoubtedly,\nCongress intends the Indian tribes to benefit from the Government\u2019s\nmanagement of tribal trusts. That intention represents \u201ca humane\nand self imposed policy\u201d based on felt \u201cmoral obligations.\u201dSeminole Nation, 316 U. S., at 296\u2013297. This statutory\npurpose does not imply a full common-law trust, however. Cf.\nRestatement 2d, \u00a725, Commentb(\u201cNo trust is created if\nthe settlor manifests an intention to impose merely a moral\nobligation\u201d). Congress makes such policy judgments pursuant to its\nsovereign governing authority, and the implementation of federal\npolicy remains \u201cdistinctly an interest of the United States.\u201dHeckman, 224 U. S., at 437.[Footnote 7] We have said that \u201cthe United States\ncontinue[s] as trustee to have an active interest\u201d in the\ndisposition of Indian assets because the terms of the trust\nrelationship embody policy goals of the United States.McKayv.Kalyton,204 U. S. 458, 469\n(1907).In some prior cases, we have found that the\nGovernment had established the trust relationship in order to\nimpose its own policy on Indian lands. SeeMitchell I, 445\nU. S., at 544 (Congress \u201cintended that the United States \u2018hold the\nland \u2026 in trust\u2019 \u2026 because it wished to prevent alienation of the\nland\u201d). In other cases, the Government has invoked its trust\nrelationship to prevent state interference with its policy toward\nthe Indian tribes. SeeMinnesotav.United\nStates,305 U.\nS. 382, 386 (1939);Candelaria, 271 U. S., at 442\u2013444;United Statesv.Kagama,118 U. S. 375, 382\u2013384\n(1886). And the exercise of federal authority thereby established\nhas often been \u201cleft under the acts of Congress to the discretion\nof the Executive Department.\u201dHeckman,supra, at\n446. In this way, Congress has designed the trust relationship to\nserve the interests of the United States as well as to benefit the\nIndian tribes. SeeUnited Statesv.Rickert,188 U. S. 432,\n443 (1903) (trust relationship \u201c\u00a0\u2018authorizes the adoption on\nthe part of the United States of such policy as their own public\ninterests may dictate\u2019\u00a0\u201d (quotingChoctaw Nationv.United States,119 U. S. 1, 28\n(1886))).[Footnote 8]We cannot agree with the Tribe and itsamicithat \u201c[t]he government and its officials who\nobtained the advice have no stake in [the] substance of the advice,\nbeyond their trustee role,\u201d Brief for Respondent 9, or that \u201cthe\nUnited States\u2019 interests in trust administration were identical to\nthe interests of the tribal trust fund beneficiaries,\u201d Brief for\nNational Congress of American Indians et\u00a0al. asAmici\nCuriae5. The United States has a sovereign interest in the\nadministration of Indian trusts distinct from the private interests\nof those who may benefit from its administration. Courts apply the\nfiduciary exception on the ground that \u201cmanagement does not manage\nfor itself.\u201dGarner, 430 F.\u00a02d, at 1101;Wachtel, 482 F.\u00a03d, at 232 (\u201c[O]f central importance\nin bothGarnerandRiggswas the fiduciary\u2019s lack\nof a legitimate personal interest in the legal advice obtained\u201d).\nBut the Government is never in that position. While one purpose of\nthe Indian trust relationship is to benefit the tribes, the\nGovernment has its own independent interest in the implementation\nof federal Indian policy. For that reason, when the Government\nseeks legal advice related to the administration of tribal trusts,\nit establishes an attorney-client relationship related to its\nsovereign interest in the execution of federal law. In other words,\nthe Government seeks legal advice in a \u201cpersonal\u201d rather than a\nfiduciary capacity. SeeRiggs, 355 A.\u00a02d, at 711.Moreover, the Government has too many\ncompeting legal concerns to allow a case-by-case inquiry into the\npurpose of each communication. When \u201cmultiple interests\u201d are\ninvolved in a trust relationship, the equivalence between the\ninterests of the beneficiary and the trustee breaks down.Id., at 714. That principle applies with particular force\nto the Government. Because of the multiple interests it must\nrepresent, \u201cthe Government cannot follow the fastidious standards\nof a private fiduciary, who would breach his duties to his single\nbeneficiary solely by representing potentially conflicting\ninterests without the beneficiary\u2019s consent.\u201dNevadav.United States,463 U. S. 110, 128\n(1983).As the Court of Appeals acknowledged, the\nGovernment may be obliged \u201cto balance competing interests\u201d when it\nadministers a tribal trust. 590 F.\u00a03d, at 1315. The Government\nmay need to comply with other statutory duties, such as the\nenvironmental and conservation obligations that the Court of\nAppeals discussed. Seeid., at 1314\u20131315. The Government\nmay also face conflicting obligations to different tribes or\nindividual Indians. See,e.g.,Nancev.EPA, 645 F.\u00a02d 701, 711 (CA9 1981) (Federal\nGovernment has \u201cconflicting fiduciary responsibilities\u201d to the\nNorthern Cheyenne and Crow Tribes);Hoopa Valley Tribev.Christie, 812 F. 2d 1097, 1102 (CA9 1986) (\u201cNo trust\nrelation exists which can be discharged to the plaintiff here at\nthe expense of other Indians\u201d). Within the bounds of its \u201cgeneral\ntrust relationship\u201d with the Indian people, we have recognized that\nthe Government has \u201cdiscretion to reorder its priorities from\nserving a subgroup of beneficiaries to serving the broader class of\nall Indians nationwide.\u201dLincolnv.Vigil,508 U. S. 182,\n195 (1993); see alsoibid.(\u201cFederal Government \u2018does have\na fiduciary obligation to the Indians; but it is a fiduciary\nobligation that is owed toallIndian tribes\u2019\u00a0\u201d\n(quotingHoopa Valley Tribe,supra, at 1102)).\nAnd sometimes, we have seen, the Government has enforced the trust\nstatutes to dispose of Indian property contrary to the wishes of\nthose for whom it was nominally kept in trust. The Government may\nseek the advice of counsel for guidance in balancing these\ncompeting interests. Indeed, the point of consulting counsel may be\nto determine whether conflicting interests are at stake.The Court of Appeals sought to accommodate the\nGovernment\u2019s multiple obligations by suggesting that the Government\nmay invoke the attorney-client privilege if it identifies \u201ca\nspecific competing interest\u201d that was considered in the particular\ncommunications it seeks to withhold. 590 F.\u00a03d, at 1313. But\nthe conflicting interests the Government must consider are too\npervasive for such a case-by-case approach to be workable.We have said that for the attorney-client\nprivilege to be effective, it must be predictable. SeeJaffeev.Redmond,518 U. S. 1, 18 (1996);Upjohn, 449 U. S., at 393. If the Government were required\nto identify the specific interests it considered in each\ncommunication, its ability to receive confidential legal advice\nwould be substantially compromised. The Government will not always\nbe able to predict what considerations qualify as a \u201cspecific\ncompeting interest,\u201d especially in advance of receiving counsel\u2019s\nadvice. Forcing the Government to monitor all the considerations\ncontained in each communication with counsel would render its\nattorney-client privilege \u201clittle better than no privilege at all.\u201dIbid.BThe Court of Appeals also decided\nthe fiduciary exception properly applied to the Government because\n\u201cthe fiduciary has a duty to disclose all information related to\ntrust management to the beneficiary.\u201d 590 F.\u00a03d, at 1312. In\ngeneral, the common-law trustee of an irrevocable trust must\nproduce trust-related information to the beneficiary on a\nreasonable basis, though this duty is sometimes limited and may be\nmodified by the settlor. Restatement (Third) of Trusts \u00a782 (2005)\n(hereinafter Restatement 3d); Bogert \u00a7\u00a7962, 965.[Footnote 9] The fiduciary exception applies where\nthis duty of disclosure overrides the attorney-client privilege.United Statesv.Mett, 178 F.\u00a03d 1058, 1063\n(CA9 1999) (\u201c[T]he fiduciary exception can be understood as an\ninstance of the attorney-client privilege giving way in the face of\na competing legal principle\u201d).The United States, however, does\nnot have the same common-law disclosure obligations as a private\ntrustee. As we have previously said, common-law principles are\nrelevant only when applied to a \u201cspecific, applicable,\ntrust-creating statute or regulation.\u201dNavajo II, 556 U.\nS., at ___ (slip op., at 14). The relevant statute in this case is\n25 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7162a(d), which delineates \u201ctrust responsibilities\nof the United States\u201d that the Secretary of the Interior must\ndischarge. The enumerated responsibilities include a provision\nidentifying the Secretary\u2019s obligation to provide specific\ninformation to tribal account holders: The Secretary must \u201csuppl[y]\naccount holders with periodic statements of their account\nperformance\u201d and must make \u201cavailable on a daily basis\u201d the\n\u201cbalances of their account.\u201d \u00a7162a(d)(5). The Secretary has\ncomplied with these requirements by adopting regulations that\ninstruct the Office of Trust Fund Management to provide each tribe\nwith a quarterly statement of performance, 25 CFR \u00a7115.801 (2010),\nthat identifies \u201cthe source, type, and status of the trust funds\ndeposited and held in a trust account; the beginning balance; the\ngains and losses; receipts and disbursements; and the ending\naccount balance of the quarterly statement period,\u201d \u00a7115.803.\nTribes may request more frequent statements or further \u201cinformation\nabout account transactions and balances.\u201d \u00a7115.802.The common law of trusts does not override the\nspecific trust-creating statute and regulations that apply here.\nThose provisions define the Government\u2019s disclosure ob-ligation to\nthe Tribe. The Tribe emphasizes, Brief for Respondent 34, that the\nstatute identifies the list of trust responsibilities as\nnonexhaustive. See \u00a7162a(d) (trust responsibilities \u201care not\nlimited to\u201d those enumerated). The Government replies that this\nclause \u201cis best read to refer to other statutory and regulatory\nrequirements\u201d rather than to common-law duties. Brief for United\nStates 38. Whatever Congress intended, we cannot read the clause to\ninclude a general common-law duty to disclose all information\nrelated to the administration of Indian trusts. When Congress\nprovides specific statutory obligations, we will not read a\n\u201ccatchall\u201d provision to impose general obligations that would\ninclude those specifically enumerated.Massachusetts Mut. Life\nIns. Co.v.Russell,473 U. S. 134, 141\u2013142\n(1985). \u201cAs our cases have noted in the past, we are hesitant to\nadopt an interpretation of a congressional enactment which renders\nsuperfluous another portion of that same law.\u201dMackeyv.Lanier Collection Agency & Service,Inc.,486 U. S. 825,\n837 (1988). Reading the statute to incorporate the full duties of a\nprivate, common-law fiduciary would vitiate Congress\u2019 specification\nof narrowly defined disclosure obligations.[Footnote 10]By law and regulation, moreover, the documents\nat issue in this case are classed \u201cthe property of the United\nStates\u201d while other records are \u201cthe property of the tribe.\u201d 25 CFR\n\u00a7115.1000 (2010); see also \u00a7\u00a715.502, 162.111, 166.1000. Just as the\nsource of the funds used to pay for legal advice is highly relevant\nin identifying the \u201creal client\u201d for purposes of the fiduciary\nexception, we consider ownership of the resulting records to be a\nsignificant factor in deciding who \u201cought to have access to the\ndocument.\u201d SeeRiggs, 355 A.\u00a02d, at 712. In this\ncase, that privilege belongs to the United States.[Footnote 11]*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*Courts and commentators have long\nrecognized that \u201c[n]ot every aspect of private trust law can\nproperly govern the unique relationship of tribes and the federal\ngovernment.\u201d Cohen \u00a75.02[2], at 434\u2013435. The fiduciary exception to\nthe attorney-client privilege ranks among those aspects\ninapplicable to the Government\u2019s administration of Indian trusts.\nThe Court of Appeals denied the Government\u2019s petition for a writ of\nmandamus based on its erroneous view to the contrary. We leave it\nfor that court to determine whether the standards for granting the\nwrit are met in light of our opinion.[Footnote 12] We therefore reverse the judgment of the\nCourt of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.Justice Kagan took no part in the\nconsideration or decision of this case.Footnote 1The CFC held that there is no fiduciary\nexception to the work-product doctrine. 88 Fed.\u00a0Cl.\u00a01, 12\n(2009). The Court of Appeals did not address that issue,In re\nUnited States, 590 F.\u00a03d 1305, 1313 (CA Fed. 2009), and\nit is not before us.Footnote 2After the Federal Circuit denied the\nGovernment\u2019s mandamus petition, the Government produced the\ndocuments under a protective order that prevents disclosure to\nthird parties until the case is resolved by this Court. App. to\nPet. for Cert. 93a\u201397a. The Government\u2019s compliance with the\nproduction order does not affect our review. Our decision may still\nprovide effective relief by preventing further disclosure and by\nexcluding the evidence from trial. SeeMohawk Industries,\nInc.v.Carpenter, 558 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip\nop., at 8).Footnote 3Today, \u201c[c]ourts differ on whether the\n[attorney-client] privilege is available for communications between\nthe trustee and counsel regarding the administration of the trust.\u201d\nA. Newman, G. Bogert & G.\u00a0Bogert, Law of Trusts and\nTrustees \u00a7962, p. 68 (3d ed. 2010) (hereinafter Bogert). Some state\ncourts have altogether rejected the notion that the attorney-client\nprivilege is subject to a fiduciary exception. See,e.g.,Huiev.DeShazo, 922 S.\u00a0W.\u00a02d 920, 924\n(Tex. 1996) (\u201cThe attorney-client privilege serves the same\nimportant purpose in the trustee-attorney relationship as it does\nin other attorney-client relationships\u201d);Wells Fargo Bankv.Superior Ct., 22 Cal. 4th 201, 208\u2013209, 990 P.\u00a02d\n591, 595 (2000) (\u201c[T]he attorney for the trustee of a trust is not,\nby virtue of this relationship, also the attorney for the\nbeneficiaries of the trust\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).\nNeither party before this Court disputes the existence of a\ncommon-law fiduciary exception, however, so in deciding this case\nwe assume such an exception exists.Footnote 4\u201cThere are a number of widely varying\nrelationships which more or less closely resemble trusts, but which\nare not trusts, although the term \u2018trust\u2019 is sometimes used loosely\nto cover such relationships. It is important to differentiate\ntrusts from these other relationships, since many of the rules\napplicable to trusts are not applicable to them.\u201d Restatement\n(Second) of Trusts \u00a74, Introductory Note, p. 15 (1957) (hereinafter\nRestatement 2d); see alsoBegayv.United States,\n16 Cl.\u00a0Ct. 107, 127, n.\u00a017 (1987) (\u201c[T]he provisions\nrelating to private trustees and fiduciaries, while useful as\nanalogies, cannot be regarded as finally dispositive in a\ngovernment-Indian trustee-fiduciary relationship\u201d).Footnote 5Thus, the dissent\u2019s reliance on the\nGovernment\u2019s \u201cmanagerial control,\u201dpost, at 8 (opinion of\nSotomayor, J.), is misplaced.Footnote 6Cf. Restatement 2d, \u00a725, Commenta(\u201c[A]lthough the settlor has called the transaction a trust[,] no\ntrust is created unless he manifests an intention to impose duties\nwhich are enforceable in the courts\u201d).Footnote 7Chief Justice Hughes, writing for a unanimous\nCourt, insisted that the \u201cnational interest\u201d in the management of\nIndian affairs \u201cis not to be expressed in terms of property, or to\nbe limited to the assertion of rights incident to the ownership of\na reversion or to the holding of a technical title in trust.\u201dHeckman, 224 U. S., at 437.Footnote 8Congress has structured the trust\nrelationship to reflect its considered judgment about how the\nIndians ought to be governed. For example, the Indian General\nAllotment Act of 1887, 24 Stat. 388, was \u201ca comprehensive\ncongressional attempt to change the role of Indians in American\nsociety.\u201d F. Cohen, Handbook of Federal Indian Law \u00a71.04, p. 77\n(2005) (hereinafter Cohen). Congress aimed to promote the\nassimilation of Indians by dividing Indian lands into individually\nowned allotments. The federal policy aimed \u201cto substitute a new\nin-dividual way of life for the older Indian communal way.\u201dId., at 79. The Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, 48\nStat. 984, marked a shift away \u201cfrom assimilation policies and\ntoward more tolerance and respect for traditional aspects of Indian\nculture.\u201d Cohen \u00a71.05, at 84. The Act prohibited further allotment\nand restored tribal ownership.Id., at 86. The Indian\nSelf-Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975, 88 Stat.\n2203, and the Tribal Self-Governance Act of 1994, 108 Stat. 4270,\nenabled tribes to run health, education, economic development, and\nsocial programs for themselves. Cohen \u00a71.07, at 103. This\nstrengthened self-government supported Congress\u2019 decision to\nauthorize tribes to withdraw trust funds from Federal Government\ncontrol and place the funds under tribal control. American Indian\nTrust Fund Management Reform Act of 1994, 108 Stat. 4239,\n4242\u20134244; see 25 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a74021\u20134029 (2006 ed. and Supp.\nIII). The control over the Indian tribes that has been exercised by\nthe United States pursuant to the trust relationship\u2014forcing the\ndivision of tribal lands, restraining alienation\u2014does not\ncorrespond to the fiduciary duties of a common-law trustee. Rather,\nthe trust relationship has been altered and administered as an\ninstrument of federal policy.Footnote 9We assume for the sake of argument that an\nIndian trust is properly analogized to an irrevocable trust rather\nthan to a revocable trust. A revocable trust imposes no duty of the\ntrustee to disclose information to the beneficiary. \u201c[W]hile a\ntrust is revocable, only the person who may revoke it is entitled\nto receive information about it from the trustee.\u201d Bogert \u00a7962, at\n25, \u00a7964; Restatement 3d, \u00a774, Commente, at 31 (\u201c[T]he\ntrustee of a revocable trust is not to provide reports or\naccountings or other information concerning the terms or\nadministration of the trust to other beneficiaries without\nauthorization either by the settlor or in the terms of the trust or\na statute\u201d). In many respects, Indian trusts resemble revocable\ntrusts at common law because Congress has acted as the settlor in\nestablishing the trust and retains the right to alter the terms of\nthe trust by statute, even in derogation of tribal property\ninterests. SeeWintonv.Amos,255 U. S. 373, 391 (1921) (\u201cIt is\nthoroughly established that Congress has plenary authority over the\nIndians \u2026 and full power to legislate concerning their tribal\nproperty\u201d); Cohen \u00a75.02[4], at 401\u2013403. The Government has not\nadvanced the argument that the relationship here is similar to a\nrevocable trust, and the point need not be addressed to resolve\nthis case.Footnote 10Our reading of 25 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7162a(d)\nreceives additional support from another statute in which Congress\nexpressed its understanding that the Government retains evidentiary\nprivileges allowing it to withhold information related to trust\nproperty from Indian tribes. The Indian Claims Limitation Act of\n1982, 96 Stat. 1976, addressed Indian claims that the claimants\ndesired to have litigated by the United States. If the Secretary of\nthe Interior decided to reject a claim for litigation, he was\nrequired to furnish a report to the affected Indian claimants and,\nupon their request, to provide \u201cany nonprivileged research\nmaterials or evidence gathered by the United States in the\ndocumentation of such claim.\u201d Id., at 1978. That Congress\nauthorized the withholding of information on grounds of privilege\nmakes us doubt that Congress understood the Government\u2019s trust\nobligations to override so basic a privilege as that between\nattorney and client.Footnote 11The dissent tells us that applying the\nfiduciary exception is even more important against the Government\nthan against a private trustee because of a \u201chistory of\ngovernmental mismanagement.\u201dPost, at 21. While it is not\nnecessary to our decision, we note that the Indian tribes are not\nrequired to keep their funds in federal trust. See 25 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a74022 (authorizing tribes to withdraw funds held in trust by the\nUnited States); 25 CFR pt. 1200(B). If the Tribe wishes to have its\nfunds managed by a \u201cconventional fiduciary,\u201dpost, at 10,\nit may seek to do so.Footnote 12If the Court of Appeals declines to issue the\nwrit, we assume that the CFC on remand will follow our holding here\nregarding the applicability of the fiduciary exception in the\npresent context.",
