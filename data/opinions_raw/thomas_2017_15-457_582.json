I therefore concur only in the\njudgment.The plaintiffs in this case, respondents here,\nsued Microsoft, petitioner here, to recover damages after they\npurchased allegedly faulty video game consoles that Microsoft\nmanufactured. The plaintiffs brought claims for themselves\n(individual claims) and on behalf of a putative class of similarly\nsituated consumers (class allegations). Early in the litigation,\nthe District Court granted Microsoft\u2019s motion to strike the class\nallegations, effectively declining to certify the class. The Court\nof Appeals denied permission to appeal that decision under Federal\nRule of Civil Procedure 23(f), which requires a party to obtain\npermission from the court of appeals before appealing a decision\nregarding class certification.The plaintiffs decided not to pursue their\nindividual claims, instead stipulating to a voluntary dismissal of\nthose claims with prejudice. They then filed a notice of appeal\nfrom the voluntary dismissal order. On appeal, they did not ask the\nCourt of Appeals to reverse the District Court\u2019s dismissal of their\nindividual claims. They instead asked the Court of Appeals to\nreverse the order striking their class allegations. The question\npresented in this case is whether the Court of Appeals had\njurisdiction to hear the appeal under both \u00a71291, which grants\nappellate jurisdiction to the courts of appeals over \u201cfinal\ndecisions\u201d by district courts, and under Article III of the\nConstitution, which limits the jurisdiction of federal courts to\n\u201ccases\u201d and \u201ccontroversies.\u201dThe Court today holds that the Court of Appeals\nlacked jurisdiction under \u00a71291 because the voluntary dismissal\nwith prejudice did not result in a \u201cfinal decision.\u201d I dis-agree\nwith that holding. A decision is \u201cfinal\u201d for purposes of \u00a71291 if\nit \u201cends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the\ncourt to do but execute the judgment.\u201dCatlinv.United\nStates, 324 U.\u00a0S. 229, 233 (1945) . The order here\ndismissed all of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims with prejudice and left\nnothing for the District Court to do but execute the judgment. See\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 39a (\u201cdirect[ing] the Clerk to enter\nJudgment .\u00a0.\u00a0. and close th[e] case\u201d).The Court reaches the opposite conclusion,\nrelying not on the text of \u00a71291 or this Court\u2019s precedents about\nfinality, but on Rule 23(f). Rule 23(f) makes interlocutory orders\nregarding class certification appealable only with the permission\nof the court of appeals. The Court concludes that the plaintiffs\u2019\n\u201cvoluntary dismissal\u201d \u201cdoes not qualify as a \u2018final\ndecision\u2019\u00a0\u201d because allowing the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal would\n\u201csubvert the balanced solution Rule 23(f) put in place for\nimmediate review of class-action orders.\u201dAnte,at 2.The Court\u2019s conclusion does not follow from its\nreasoning. Whether a dismissal with prejudice is \u201cfinal\u201d depends on\nthe meaning of \u00a71291, not Rule 23(f). Rule 23(f) says nothing about\nfinality, much less about the finality of an order dismissing\nindividual claims with prejudice. I agree with the Court that the\nplaintiffs are trying to avoid the requirements for interlocutory\nappeals under Rule 23(f), but our view of the balance struck in\nthat rule should not warp our understanding of finality under\n\u00a71291.Although I disagree with the Court\u2019s reading of\n\u00a71291, I agree that the plaintiffs could not appeal in these\ncircumstances. In my view, they could not appeal because the Court\nof Appeals lacked jurisdiction under Article III of the\nConstitution. The \u201cjudicial Power\u201d of the United States extends\nonly to \u201cCases\u201d and \u201cControversies.\u201d Art.\u00a0III, \u00a72. This\nrequirement limits the jurisdiction of the federal courts to issues\npresented \u201cin an adversary context,\u201dFlastv.Cohen,\n392 U.\u00a0S. 83, 95 (1968) , in which the parties maintain an\n\u201cactual\u201d and \u201cconcrete\u201d interest,Campbell-Ewald Co.v.Gomez, 577 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 6)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Put another way, \u201cArticle III\ndenies federal courts the power to decide questions that cannot\naffect the rights of litigants in the case before them, and\nconfines them to resolving real and substantial controversies\nadmitting of specific relief through a decree of a conclusive\ncharacter.\u201dLewisv.Continental Bank Corp., 494\nU.\u00a0S. 472, 477 (1990) (internal quotation marks, citation, and\nalteration omitted).The plaintiffs\u2019 appeal from their voluntary\ndismissal did not satisfy this jurisdictional requirement. When the\nplaintiffs asked the District Court to dismiss their claims, they\nconsented to the judgment against them and dis-avowed any right to\nrelief from Microsoft. The parties thus were no longer adverse to\neach other on any claims, and the Court of Appeals could not\n\u201caffect the[ir] rights\u201d in any legally cognizable manner.Ibid. Indeed, it has long been the rule that a party may not\nappeal from the voluntary dismissal of a claim, since the party\nconsented to the judgment against it. See,e.g., Evansv.Phillips, 4 Wheat. 73 (1819);Lordv.Veazie,\n8 How. 251, 255\u2013256 (1850);United Statesv.Babbitt,\n104 U.\u00a0S. 767 (1882) ;Deakinsv.Monaghan, 484\nU.\u00a0S. 193 \u2013200 (1988).The plaintiffs contend that their interest in\nreversing the order striking their class allegations is sufficient\nto satisfy Article III\u2019s case-or-controversy requirement, but they\nmisunderstand the status of putative class actions. Class\nallegations, without an underlying individual claim, do not give\nrise to a \u201ccase\u201d or \u201ccontroversy.\u201d Those allegations are simply the\nmeans of invoking a procedural mechanism that enables a plaintiff\nto litigate his individual claims on behalf of a class. SeeShady Grove Orthopedic Associates, P.A.v.Allstate Ins. Co., 559 U.\u00a0S. 393, 408 (2010) (plurality\nopinion). Thus, because the Court of Appeals lacked Article III\njurisdiction to adjudicate the individual claims, it could not hear\nthe plaintiffs\u2019 appeal of the order striking their class\nallegations.Plaintiffs\u2019 representation that they hope to\n\u201crevive their [individual] claims should they prevail\u201d on the\nappeal of the order striking their class allegations does not\nundermine this conclusion. Brief for Respondents 45. This Court has\ninterpreted Article III \u201cto demand that an ac-tual controversy be\nextant at all stages of review, not merely at the time the\ncomplaint is filed.\u201dCampbell Ewald Co.,supra, at\n___ (slip op., at 6) (internal quotation marks and alterations\nomitted). And in any event, a favorable ruling on class\ncertification would not \u201crevive\u201d their individual claims: A court\u2019s\ndecision about class allegations \u201cin no way touch[es] the merits\u201d\nof those claims.Gardnerv.Westinghouse Broadcasting\nCo., 437 U.\u00a0S. 478, 482 (1978) .*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*Because I would hold that the Court of Appeals\nlacked jurisdiction under Article III to consider respondents\u2019\nappeal, I concur in the judgment.",
