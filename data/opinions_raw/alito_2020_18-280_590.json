    "text": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES_________________No. 18\u2013280_________________NEW YORK STATE RIFLE & PISTOL ASSOCIATION,\nINC., et\u00a0al., PETITIONERSv.CITY OF NEW YORK, NEW\nYORK, et\u00a0al.on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the second circuit[April 27, 2020]Justice Alito, with whom Justice Gorsuch\njoins, and with whom Justice Thomas joins except for Part IV\u2013B,\ndissenting.By incorrectly dismissing this case as moot, the\nCourt permits our docket to be manipulated in a way that should not\nbe countenanced. Twelve years ago inDistrict of Columbiav.Heller,554 U.S.\n570(2008), we held that the Second Amendment protects the\nright of ordinary Americans to keep and bear arms. Two years later,\nour decision inMcDonaldv.Chicago,561 U.S.\n742(2010), established that this right is fully applicable to\nthe States. Since then, the lower courts have decided numerous\ncases involving Second Amendment challenges to a variety of\nfederal, state, and local laws. Most have failed. We have been\nasked to review many of these decisions, but until this case, we\ndenied all such requests.On January 22, 2019, we granted review to\nconsider the constitutionality of a New York City ordinance that\nburdened the right recognized inHeller. Among other things,\nthe ordinance prohibited law-abiding New Yorkers with a license to\nkeep a handgun in the home (a \u201cpremises license\u201d) from taking that\nweapon to a firing range outside the City. Instead, premises\nlicensees wishing to gain or maintain the ability to use their\nweapons safely were limited to the seven firing ranges in the City,\nall but one of which were largely restricted to members and their\nguests.In the District Court and the Court of Appeals,\nthe City vigorously and successfully defended the constitutionality\nof its ordinance, and the law was upheld based on what we are told\nis the framework for reviewing Second Amendment claims that has\nbeen uniformly adopted by the Courts of Appeals.[1] One might have thought that the City,\nhaving convinced the lower courts that its law was consistent withHeller, would have been willing to defend its victory in\nthis Court. But once we granted certiorari, both the City and the\nState of New York sprang into action to prevent us from deciding\nthis case. Although the City had previously insisted that its\nordinance served important public safety purposes, our grant of\nreview apparently led to an epiphany of sorts, and the City quickly\nchanged its ordinance. And for good measure the State enacted a law\nmaking the old New York City ordinance illegal.Thereafter, the City andamicisupporting\nits position strove to have this case thrown out without briefing\nor argument. The City moved for dismissal \u201cas soon as is reasonably\npracticable\u201d on the ground that it had \u201cno legal reason to file a\nbrief.\u201d Suggestion of Mootness 1. When we refused to jettison the\ncase at that early stage, the City submitted a brief but\n\u201cstress[ed] that [its] true position [was] that it ha[d] no view at\nall regarding the constitutional questions presented\u201d and that it\nwas \u201coffer[ing] a defense of the .\u00a0.\u00a0. former rul[e] in\nthe spirit of something a Court-appointedamicus curiaemight do.\u201d Brief for Respondents 2.A prominent brief supporting the City went\nfurther. Five United States Senators, four of whom are members of\nthe bar of this Court, filed a brief insisting that the case be\ndismissed. If the Court did not do so, they intimated, the public\nwould realize that the Court is \u201cmotivated mainly by politics,\nrather than by adherence to the law,\u201d and the Court would face the\npossibility of legislative reprisal. Brief for Sen. Sheldon\nWhitehouse et\u00a0al. asAmici Curiae2\u20133, 18 (internal\nquotation marks omitted).Regrettably, the Court now dismisses the case as\nmoot. If the Court were right on the law, I would of course approve\nthat disposition. Under the Constitution, our authority is limited\nto deciding actual cases or controversies, and if this were no\nlonger a live controversy\u2014that is, if it were now moot\u2014we would be\ncompelled to dismiss. But if a case is on our docket and we have\njurisdiction, we have an obligation to decide it. As Chief Justice\nMarshall wrote for the Court inCohensv.Virginia, 6\nWheat. 264, 404 (1821), \u201c[w]e have no more right to decline the\nexercise of jurisdiction which is given, than to usurp that which\nis not given.\u201dThus, in this case, we must apply the\nwell-established standards for determining whether a case is moot,\nand under those standards, we still have a live case before us. It\nis certainly true that the new City ordinance and the new State law\ngive petitionersmost ofwhat they sought, but that is not\nthe test for mootness. Instead, \u201ca case \u2018becomes moot only when it\nisimpossiblefor a court to grantany effectual relief\nwhateverto the prevailing party.\u2019\u00a0\u201dChafinv.Chafin,568 U.S.\n165, 172 (2013) (emphasis added). \u201c\u00a0\u2018As long as the\nparties have a concrete interest,however small, in the\noutcome of the litigation, the case is not moot.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIbid.(emphasis added).Respondents have failed to meet this \u201cheavy\nburden.\u201dAdarand Constructors,Inc.v.Slater,528 U.S.\n216, 222 (2000) (per\u00a0curiam) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). This is so for two reasons. First, the changes in\nCity and State law do not provide petitioners with all the\ninjunctive relief they sought. Second, if we reversed on the\nmerits, the District Court on remand could award damages to remedy\nthe constitutional violation that petitioners suffered.IA1New York State has strict laws governing the\npossession of firearms. With only a few exceptions, possession\nwithout a license is punishable by imprisonment and a fine.\nN.\u00a0Y. Penal Law Ann. \u00a7\u00a760.01(3), 70.15, 265.01\u2013265.04,\n265.20(a)(3) (West Cum. Supp. 2020). Local authorities administer\nthe licensing program, \u00a7400.00(3)(a), and in New York City, this is\ndone by the New York City Police Department\u2019s (NYPD\u2019s) License\nDivision. See 38 N.\u00a0Y.\u00a0C. R. R. \u00a75\u201301et seq.(2020); N.\u00a0Y. Penal Law Ann. \u00a7265.00(10); N.\u00a0Y.\u00a0C.\nAdmin. Code \u00a710\u2013131 (2020).New York State law contemplates two primary\nforms of handgun license\u2014a premises license, which allows the\nlicensee to keep the registered handgun at a home or business, and\na carry license, which permits the licensee to carry a concealed\nhandgun outside the home. N.\u00a0Y. Penal Law Ann. \u00a7\u00a7400.00(2)(a),\n(b), (f\u00a0). In this case, only premises licenses are at\nissue.State law imposes an exacting standard for\nobtaining a premises license, and the NYPD License Division\nsubjects applicants to rigorous vetting. Licenses may be issued\nonly if, among other things, an applicant is \u201cof good moral\ncharacter\u201d and \u201cno good cause exists for the denial of the\nlicense.\u201d \u00a7\u00a7400.00(1)(b), (n); see also App. 95\u2013109 (\u201cInstructions\nto Handgun License Applicants\u201d) (capitalization omitted).New York City residents must submit their\napplications in-person at One Police Plaza in Manhattan. An\napplicant must pay a fee of $431.50; must provide proof of age,\ncitizenship, and residence; and must produce an original Social\nSecurity card.Id., at 95\u201396, 98. A completed application\nmust specify the particular handgun that the applicant wishes to\npossess and the address for which the license is sought. It must\nlist all the applicant\u2019s residences and places of employment for\nthe past five years.Id., at 99\u2013100, 104\u2013105. An applicant\nmust answer questions about past arrests, summonses, indictments,\nconvictions, and civil orders, and must respond to probing\nquestions about past drug use, subpoenas and testimony,\nunsuccessful applications for civil service positions, military\nservice, mental illness, and physical conditions (such as\n\u201cEpilepsy,\u201d \u201cDiabetes,\u201d or \u201cany Nervous Disorder\u201d) that could, in\nthe judgment of the License Division, interfere with the use of a\nhandgun.Id., at 96\u201397, 101\u2013102. The applicant must explain\nwhere and how he or she will safeguard the handgun when not in use,\nand furnish the name and address of a New York State resident who\nwill take custody of the handgun in the event of the applicant\u2019s\ndeath or disability.Id., at 104.And these application requirements are only the\nbeginning. The submission of an application triggers a\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018rigorous\u2019\u00a0\u201d police investigation \u201cinto the applicant\u2019s\nmental health history, criminal history, [and] moral character.\u201dKachalskyv.County of Westchester, 701 F.3d 81, 87\n(CA2 2012). A licensing officer is required by law to review mental\nhealth records, investigate the truthfulness of the statements in\nthe application, and forward the applicant\u2019s fingerprints to the\nNew York State Division of Criminal Justice Services and the\nFederal Bureau of Investigation to determine if the applicant has a\ncriminal record. N.\u00a0Y. Penal Law Ann. \u00a7\u00a7400.00(1), (4). Under\nCity law, grounds for denial include, among other things, any\narrest, indictment, or conviction for a crime or violation (with\nthe exception of minor traffic violations) in any federal, state,\nor local jurisdiction; a dishonorable discharge from the military;\nalcoholism, drug use, or mental illness; \u201ca poor driving history\u201d;\nfailure to pay debts, including child support and taxes; and\nuntruthfulness in the application. 38 N.\u00a0Y.\u00a0C. R. R.\n\u00a75\u201310. The process also includes an in-person interview, during\nwhich the License Division may request additional paperwork. App.\n100.It takes the License Division approximately six\nmonths to process applications, \u00a75\u201307(a), and during this time, the\napplicant cannot lawfully possess a handgun in the home, \u00a75\u201309.\nWhen the license issues and the applicant wishes to obtain it, he\nor she must appear in person at police headquarters for at least\nthe third time. \u00a75\u201307(b). At present, we are told, approximately\n40,000 City residents (representing about 1.29% of the households\nin the City)[2] have been\nissued handgun licenses.The NYPD may revoke a premises license at any\ntime, \u00a75\u201307(d), including for such things as laminating the\nlicense, \u00a75\u201322(a)(4). And a license expires after three years, so a\nlicensee who wants to continue to possess a gun in the home after\nthat time must file a renewal application. \u00a75\u201328(a).2The ordinance that petitioners challenged in\nthis case was adopted in 2001. Before then, the NYPD issued both\npremises licenses and so-called \u201ctarget licenses,\u201d which allowed\nlicensees to transport their handguns to specified, preapproved\nranges outside of the City. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 90\u201392.\nTarget licenses were eliminated in 2001, and from that time until\nthe City\u2019s post-certiorari change of heart, premises licensees\ncould practice with their guns only if: they traveled \u201cdirectly to\nand from anauthorizedsmall arms range/shooting club\u201d;\ntheir guns were unloaded and secured in a locked container; and any\nammunition was \u201ccarried separately.\u201d \u00a75\u201323(a)(3) (in effect prior\nto July 21, 2019) (emphasis added);id., at 88. And\u2014what is\nmost important for present purposes\u2014the only \u201cauthorized\u201d ranges or\nclubs were ones \u201clocated in New York City.\u201d App. 50, 63. At the\nrelevant time, there were only seven such ranges in the entire\nCity: two in Staten Island, two in Queens, one in Brooklyn, one in\nManhattan, and one in the Bronx. Seeid., at 92\u201393. All but\none generally admitted only members and their guests, and the only\nrange open to the public was closed for a time during the pendency\nof the case below.B1In 2013, three individuals and one\norganization representing New York gun owners brought suit under\nRev. Stat. \u00a71979, 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71983, against the City and\nthe NYPD License Division, contending that the restrictive premises\nlicense scheme, 38 N.\u00a0Y.\u00a0C. R. R. \u00a75\u201323, violated their\nrights under the Second Amendment and other provisions of the\nConstitution.One of the individual petitioners, Romolo\nColantone, has held a New York City firearms license since 1979.\nApp. 28\u201329, 51. Colantone currently has a premises license for his\nresidence and wishes to take his handgun to ranges and competitions\noutside the City and to his second home in Hancock, New York. He\nrefrained from doing so because of the ordinance prohibiting such\ntravel.Id., at 32, 53\u201354. For example, Colantone registered\nto participate in the 2012 World Class Steel Northeast Regional\nChampionship in Old Bridge, New Jersey\u2014about 20 miles from his home\nin the City. Plaintiffs\u2019 Memorandum in Support of Cross-Motion for\nSummary Judgt. in No. 13\u2013cv\u20132115 (SDNY), Doc. No. 44 (Plaintiffs\u2019\nMemo). But after the hosts of that competition alerted him that his\npremises license did not allow him to transport his handgun to New\nJersey\u2014and after Inspector Andrew Lunetta, the commanding officer\nof the NYPD License Division, confirmed this\u2014Colantone pulled out\nof the competition. App. 32, 49\u201350, 55.Plaintiff Efrain Alvarez has had a firearms\nlicense for approximately 30 years, and plaintiff Jose Anthony\nIrizarry has been licensed for 15 years. Both men would like to\ntake their handguns to ranges and competitions outside the City,\nbut they have not done so because of the same ordinance. Seeid., at 29, 32\u201333. After the hosts of the previously noted\ncompetition in New Jersey advised them that their New York City\npremises licenses barred them from taking their handguns outside\nthe City, they both decided not to attend.Id., at 32\u201333.\nFor the same reason, Alvarez also did not participate in the\nInternational Defensive Pistol Association Postal Matches in\nSimsbury, Connecticut.Ibid.All three individual\npetitioners aver that they regularly traveled outside the City to\nranges and championships before learning of the restriction imposed\nby \u00a75\u201323.Id., at 32\u201333.Petitioners\u2019 amended complaint maintained that\nthe Second Amendment requires \u201cunrestrictedaccess to gun\nranges and shooting events in order to practice and perfect safe\ngun handling skills.\u201dId., at 36 (emphasis added). The\ncomplaint asserts that practice is necessary for \u201cthe safe and\nresponsible use of firearms for .\u00a0.\u00a0. self-defense, and\nthe defense of one\u2019s home.\u201dId., at 33. And a New York City\nordinance backs this up, providing that a licensee \u201cshould endeavor\nto engage in periodic handgun practice at an authorized small arms\nrange/shooting club.\u201d \u00a75\u201322(a)(14). According to the complaint, the\nCity, by limiting licensees like petitioners to the seven ranges in\nthe City, imposed a serious burden on the exercise of their Second\nAmendment right. App. 36.The amended complaint\u2019s prayer for relief sought\nan injunction against enforcement of the travel restriction, as\nwell as attorney\u2019s fees, costs of suit, declaratory relief\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. and \u201c[a]ny such further relief as the [c]ourt\ndeems just and proper.\u201dId., at 47\u201348 (emphasis\nadded).2The City vigorously defended its law. The\nordinance did not impinge on petitioners\u2019 Second Amendment right,\nthe City told the lower courts, and even if it did, the law\nsurvived heightened scrutiny. That was so, the City maintained,\nbecause the travel restrictions were \u201cnecessary to protect the\npublic safety insofar as the transport of firearms outside the home\npotentially endangers the public.\u201d City of New York\u2019s Memorandum in\nSupport of Cross-Motion for Summary Judgt. & Opposition to\nPlaintiffs\u2019 Motion for Preliminary Injunction in No. 13\u2013cv\u20132115,\nDoc. No. 36, p.\u00a010.To support this assertion, the City relied on\nthe declaration of Inspector Lunetta, which attempted to explain\nwhy the restrictions were \u201cnecessary to address .\u00a0.\u00a0.\npublic safety concerns.\u201d App. 76. Lunetta justified the law in\nthree ways. First, he maintained that the restriction on\nout-of-city transport promoted public safety by causing \u201cpremises\nlicense holders [to] bring their firearms into the public domain\nless frequently.\u201dId., at 78; see alsoid., at\n77.Second, he claimed that the transport\nrestriction helped to prevent the gun violence that might occur if\na licensee became involved in an altercation while on the way to an\nout-of-city range or competition. Lunetta asserted that licensees\nare \u201cas susceptible as anyone else\u201d to \u201cstress-inducing\ncircumstances\u201d that can lead to violence.Ibid.Finally, he claimed that the travel restriction\nmade it simpler for a patrol officer to check whether the holder of\na premises license who is found in possession of a gun outside the\nhome is really headed for a range or is simply using that as a\npretext for carrying a gun.Id., at 78\u201379. He declared that\n\u201cthere were several reported cases where [holders of premises or\ntarget licenses] were charged with criminal possession of a weapon\nwhen found with their firearms while not en route to a range.\u201dId., at 89. He cited five cases,id., at 88\u201389, but\nnot one of the opinions indicates that the licensee claimed to be\nheaded to a range or competition outside the City.[3]The District Court denied petitioners\u2019 motions\nfor preliminary injunction and summary judgment and granted the\nCity\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment. 86 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d 249,\n261\u2013263 (2015). The District Court deemed any burden on\npetitioners\u2019 Second Amendment right \u201cminimal or, at most, modest.\u201dId., at 260. And the court credited the City\u2019s public safety\nrationale, citing the Lunetta declaration approvingly and\ndiscussing the importance of the travel restrictions in limiting\nthe movement of licensees with their handguns. Seeid., at\n262.The Second Circuit affirmed. The panel derided\nthe ordinance\u2019s burdens on petitioners\u2019 Second Amendment right as\n\u201ctrivial\u201d and expressly credited Lunetta\u2019s explanation of the\npublic safety purposes served by the travel restriction. 883 F.3d\n45, 63\u201364 (2018).When petitioners filed a petition for\ncertiorari, the City opposed review, contending, among other\nthings, that the travel restriction promoted public safety, as\ndemonstrated by Lunetta\u2019s declaration (which the City cited six\ntimes). Brief in Opposition 9, 21\u201323. We nevertheless granted\nreview on January 22, 2019, and this, as noted, apparently led the\nCity to reconsider whether the travel restriction was actually\nneeded for public safety purposes.COn April 12, the NYPD published a proposed\namendment to the travel restriction that was admittedly spurred at\nleast in part by our grant of review. See Motion to Hold Briefing\nSchedule in Abeyance in No. 18\u2013280, p.\u00a03. Under this\namendment, holders of premises licenses would be allowed to take\ntheir guns to ranges, competitions, and second homes outside the\nCity provided that the licensees traveled \u201cdirectly\u201d between their\nresidences and the permitted destinations. After a period of notice\nand comment, the proposed amendment was adopted on June 21 and took\neffect on July 21. Suggestion of Mootness 5\u20136.Our grant of certiorari also prompted action by\nNew York State. With the support of the City, Tr. of Oral Arg. 46,\nthe Legislature enacted a new law abrogating any local law, rule,\nor regulation that prevented the holder of a premises license from\ntransporting a licensed handgun \u201cdirectly to or from\u201d an authorized\nrange, competition, or second home. N.\u00a0Y. Penal Law Ann.\n\u00a7400.00(6) (as in effect July 16, 2019).Shortly after the new State law took effect, the\nCity filed a Suggestion of Mootness, asking us to vacate the\ndecision below and to remand with instructions to dismiss. The City\nurged us to rule on this matter expeditiously so that it would not\nbe required to file a brief defending its prior law. Suggestion of\nMootness 1. When we refused to vacate at that stage, the City\nprotested that briefing the merits \u201crequire[d] the City to do what\nArticle III\u2019s case-or-controversy requirement is designed to avoid:\nengage in litigation regarding the constitutionality of a law that\nno longer exists\u201d and that the City would not reenact. Brief for\nRespondents 1.When the case was argued, counsel for the\nCity was asked whether the repeal of the travel restriction had\nmade the City any less safe, and his unequivocal answer was no. Tr.\nof Oral Arg. 52.IIThe Court vacates the judgment of the Court of\nAppeals,apparentlyon the ground that this case is now\nmoot. (Other than mootness, no other basis for vacating comes to\nmind, and therefore I proceed on that assumption.) And if that is\nthe reason for what the Court has done, the Court is wrong. This\ncase is not moot.Article III, \u00a72 of the Constitution limits the\njurisdiction of the federal courts to \u201cCases\u201d and \u201cControversies,\u201d\nand as a result, we may not \u201c\u00a0\u2018decide questions that cannot\naffect the rights of litigants in the case before [us].\u2019\u00a0\u201dChafin, 568 U.\u00a0S., at 172. Nor may we advise\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018what the law would be upon a hypothetical state of\nfacts.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIbid. This means that the dispute between the\nparties in a case must remain alive until its ultimate disposition.\nIf a live controversy ceases to exist\u2014i.e., if a case\nbecomes moot\u2014then we have no jurisdiction to proceed. But in order\nfor this to happen, a case must really be dead, and as noted, that\noccurs only \u201c\u00a0\u2018when it is impossible for a court to grant any\neffectual relief whatever to the prevailing party.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIbid. (quotingKnoxv.ServiceEmployees,567\nU.S. 298, 307 (2012)). \u201c\u00a0\u2018[A]s long as the parties have a\nconcrete interest, however small, in the outcome of the litigation,\nthe case is not moot.\u2019\u00a0\u201dChafin, 568 U.\u00a0S., at 172\n(quotingKnox, 567 U.\u00a0S., at 307\u2013308).Thus, to\nestablish mootness, a \u201cdemanding standard\u201d must be met.Mission\nProduct Holdings,Inc. v.Tempnology,LLC,\n587 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2019) (slip op., at 6).We have been particularly wary of attempts by\nparties to manufacture mootness in order to evade review. SeeKnox, 567 U.\u00a0S., at 307; accord,Northeastern Fla.\nChapter,Associated Gen. Contractors of Americav.Jacksonville,508 U.S.\n656, 661 (1993). And it is black-letter law that we have a\n\u201cvirtually unflagging\u201d obligation to exercise our jurisdiction.Colorado River Water Conservation Dist. v.United\nStates,424 U.S.\n800, 817 (1976).In this case, the amended City ordinance and the\nnew State law gave petitioners most of what they sought in their\ncomplaint, but the new laws did not give them complete relief. It\nis entirely possible for them to obtain more relief, and therefore\nthis case is not moot. This is so for the following reasons.AFirst, this case is not moot because the\namended City ordinance and new State law do not give petitioners\nall theprospective reliefthey seek. Petitioners asserted\nin their complaint that the Second Amendment guarantees them, as\nholders of premises licenses, \u201cunrestricted access\u201d to ranges,\ncompetitions, and second homes outside of New York City, App. 36,\nand the new laws do not give them that.[4]The new City ordinance has limitations that\npetitioners claim are unconstitutional, namely, that a trip outside\nthe City must be \u201cdirec[t]\u201d and travel within the City must be\n\u201ccontinuous and uninterrupted.\u201d 38 N.\u00a0Y.\u00a0C. R. R.\n\u00a7\u00a75\u201323(a)(3), (a)(7). Exactly what these restrictions mean is not\nclear from the face of the rule, and the City has done little to\nclarify their reach. At argument, counsel told us that the new rule\nallows \u201cbathroom breaks,\u201d \u201ccoffee stops,\u201d and any other \u201creasonably\nnecessary stops in the course of travel.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 36, 64.\nBut the meaning of a \u201creasonably necessary\u201d stop is hardly clear.\nWhat about a stop to buy groceries just before coming home? Or a\nstop to pick up a friend who also wants to practice at a range\noutside the City? Or a quick visit to a sick relative or friend who\nlives near a range? The City does not know the answer to such\nquestions. See,e.g.,id., at 65\u201366.Based on all this, we are left with no clear\nidea where the City draws the line, and the situation is further\ncomplicated by the overlay of State law. The new State law appears\nto prevent the City from penalizing any \u201cdirec[t]\u201d trip to a range\nor competition outside the City, but the State law does not define\nthat limitation. The petitioners wanted to enter competitions in\nupstate New York more than a five hour drive from the City. Could\nthey stop along the way? And if so, for how long? The State has not\nexplained its understanding of this limitation, and in any event,\nprosecutorial decisions in New York are generally made by the\nState\u2019s 67 elected district attorneys. SeeHaggertyv.Himelein, 221 App.\u00a0Div. 2d 138, 144\u2013145, 644 N.Y.S.2d\n934, 940 (1996). The bottom line is that petitioners, who sought\n\u201cunrestricted access\u201d to out-of-city ranges and competitions, are\nstill subject to restrictions of undetermined meaning.These restrictions may not seem very important,\nbut that is beside the point for purposes of mootness. Nor does it\nmatter whether, in the end, those restrictions would be found to\nviolate the Second Amendment. All that matters for present purposes\nis that the City still withholds from petitioners something that\nthey have claimed from the beginning is their constitutional right.\nIt follows that the case is not moot. It is as simple as that.The situation here resembles that inKnox,567 U.S.\n298. The issue in that case was whether a public sector union\nhad provided nonmembers the sort of notice that our case law\nrequired before they could be forced to pay a fee to subsidize\ncertain union activities. We granted certiorari to review the Ninth\nCircuit\u2019s holding that the notice that the union had provided was\nsufficient, but before we could decide the case, the union sent out\na new notice and moved to dismiss the case as moot. The employees\nobjected that the new notice was inadequate, and we refused to\ndismiss. In so doing, we did not opine on the adequacy of the new\nnotice but simply held that the case was not moot because \u201cthere\n[was] still a live controversy as to the adequacy\u201d of the notice.Id., at 307. Although the new notice might have given the\nnonmembers most of what they sought, they still possessed \u201c\u00a0\u2018a\nconcrete interest, however small, in the outcome of the\nlitigation.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId., at 307\u2013308. And that was\nenough.The situation here is essentially the same.\nPetitioners got most, but not all, of the prospective relief they\nwanted, and that means that the case is not dead.BThe case is not moot for a separate and\nindependent reason: If this Court were to hold, as petitioners\nrequest and as I believe we should, that 38 N.\u00a0Y.\u00a0C. R.\nR. \u00a75\u201323 violated petitioners\u2019 Second Amendment right, the District\nCourt on remand could (and probably should) award damages. SeeMission Product Holdings, 587 U.\u00a0S., at ___.\nPetitioners brought their claims under 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71983,\nwhich permits the recovery of damages. SeeMonellv.New\nYork CityDept. of Social Servs.,436 U.S.\n658, 695\u2013701 (1978). And while the amended complaint does not\nexpressly seek damages, it is enough that it requests \u201c[a]ny other\nsuch further relief as the [c]ourt deems just and proper.\u201d App. 48.\nUnder modern pleading standards, that suffices.The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provide\nthat a \u201cfinal judgment should grant the relief to which each party\nis entitled,even if the party has not demanded that relief in\nits pleadings.\u201d Rule 54(c) (emphasis added); see also 10 C.\nWright, A. Miller, & M. Kane, Federal Practice & Procedure\n\u00a7\u00a72662, 2664 (4th ed. 2014) (Wright & Miller).[5] Courts have refused to award relief\noutside the pleadings only when that would somehow prejudice the\ndefendant, such as when the defendant did not have an opportunity\nto contest the basis for that relief. SeeAlbemarle Paper\nCo. v.Moody,422 U.S.\n405, 424 (1975);United Statesv.Marin, 651 F.2d\n24, 30 (CA1 1981); 10 Wright & Miller \u00a72664. Otherwise, \u201ca\nparty should experience little difficulty in securing a remedy\nother than that demanded in the pleadings as long as the party\nshows a right to it.\u201dId., \u00a72662, p.\u00a0168. Here, that\ncould include damages.1At a minimum, if petitioners succeeded on\ntheir challenge to the travel restrictions, they would be eligible\nfor nominal damages. When a plaintiff\u00a0\u2019s constitutional rights\nhave been violated, nominal damages may be awarded without proof of\nany additional injury. SeeCareyv.Piphus,435 U.S.\n247(1978);Memphis Community School Dist. v.Stachura,477 U.S.\n299(1986). Nominal damages are \u201cthe appropriate means of\nvindicating rights whose deprivation has not caused actual,\nprovable injury.\u201dId., at 308, n.\u00a011 (internal\nquotation marks omitted); see alsoCarey, 435 U.\u00a0S., at\n266. And they are particularly important in vindicating\nconstitutional interests. SeeRiversidev.Rivera,477 U.S.\n561, 574 (1986) (plurality opinion). Consequently, courts\nroutinely award nominal damages for constitutional violations. See,e.g.,Stoedterv.Gates, 704 Fed. Appx. 748,\n762 (CA10 2017) ( Fourth Amendment);Kleinv.Laguna\nBeach, 810 F.3d 693, 697 (CA9 2016) (free speech);Project\nVote/Voting for America,Inc. v.Dickerson, 444\nFed. Appx. 660, 661 (CA4 2011) (per\u00a0curiam) (free\nspeech);Pricev.Charlotte,93 F.3d 1241,1257(CA4 1996) (equal protection). And it is widely recognized\nthat a claim for nominal damages precludes mootness. See 13C C.\nWright, A. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure\n\u00a73533.3, n.\u00a047 (3d ed. Supp. 2019) (collecting cases); see\nalso,e.g.,Central Radio Co.v.Norfolk, 811\nF.3d 625, 631\u2013632 (CA4 2016);Morganv.Plano Independent\nSchool Dist., 589 F.3d 740, 748, n.\u00a032 (CA5 2009);Bernhardtv.Countyof Los Angeles,279 F.3d 862, 872 (CA9 2002);Amatov.Saratoga\nSprings,170 F.3d 311, 317 (CA2 1999) (Sand, J., joined by Sotomayor,\nJ.);Committee for First Amendmentv.Campbell, 962\nF.2d 1517, 1526\u20131527 (CA10 1992);Hensonv.Honor\nCommittee of U. Va., 719 F.2d 69, 72, n.\u00a05 (CA4\n1983).[6]2It is even possible that one or more of the\npetitioners may be eligible for compensatory damages. To get such\nrelief, they would of course be required to show that they suffered\nan \u201cactual injury.\u201d SeeCarey, 435 U.\u00a0S., at 266; D.\nDobbs & C. Roberts, Law of Remedies \u00a77.4(1), p.\u00a0660 (3d\ned. 2018). But petitioners may be able to make such a showing. As\ndiscussed above, the failure to include in their complaint specific\nfactual allegations of actual injury would not preclude such\nrecovery.[7] See Fed. Rule Civ.\nProc. 54(c). Nor were petitioners obligated to provide information\nsupporting actual injury in opposing the City\u2019s motion for summary\njudgment.If we were to reverse the judgment below and\nhold the City\u2019s old rule unconstitutional, it would be appropriate\nto remand the case for proceedings on the question of remedies. We\nhave frequently done this when we reverse a judgment that was\nentered against the plaintiff on liability grounds. See,e.g.,Mission Product Holdings, 587 U.\u00a0S., at\n___, ___ (deeming case live due to claim for damages, reversing\njudgment against petitioner, and remanding for further\nproceedings);Parents Involved in Community Schoolsv.Seattle School Dist. No. 1,551 U.S.\n701, 720, 748 (2007) (holding case live due in part to damages\nclaim in complaint, reversing judgment against petitioners, and\nremanding for further proceedings);Firefightersv.Stotts,467 U.S.\n561, 583 (1984) (holding case live due to damages caused by\nlower court injunction and reversing);Powellv.McCormack,395 U.S.\n486, 493, 550 (1969) (remanding for award of unpaid\ncongressional salary); cf.,e.g.,Richmondv.J.\nA. Croson Co.,488 U.S.\n469, 478, n.\u00a01 (1989) (holding that expiration of\nchallenged ordinance did not moot dispute over whether defendant\u2019s\naction was \u201cunlawful and thus entitle[d] appellee to damages\u201d).With this is mind, the possibility of actual\ndamages cannot be ruled out. One or more of the petitioners could\nseek compensation for out-of-pocket expenses, such as membership\nfees at in-city ranges. The current record shows that at least one\nof the petitioners is a member of a range in the City. App. 93\u201394.\nIn addition, a petitioner may be entitled to compensation for\nexpenses incurred in registering for out-of-city competitions from\nwhich he was compelled to withdraw. The record shows that one\npetitioner signed up for such a competition but had to pull out as\na result of the City ordinance.Id., at 32, 55. Petitioners\ncould also seek compensation for any intangible but nevertheless\nreal and personal injuries that they suffered due to their\ninability to attend shooting competitions, to practice at\nout-of-city ranges, or to take their licensed handguns to second\nhomes. Noneconomic damages such as loss of enjoyment are available\nin \u00a71983 litigation. SeeStachura, 477 U.\u00a0S., at\n306\u2013307;Carey, 435 U.\u00a0S., at 260\u2013264; Dobbs, Law of\nRemedies \u00a77.4(1), at 660, \u00a78.1(4), at 676; cf. 4 F. Harper, F.\nJames, & O. Gray, Torts \u00a725.10A (3d ed. 2007) (surveying loss\nof enjoyment awards). Among other things, depriving a licensee of\nthe opportunity to obtain the benefits of competing and perhaps\nobtaining recognition at a well-known competition may cause a real\nloss. Lower courts have affirmed awards of compensatory damages for\nsimilar kinds of injuries resulting from constitutional violations.\nSee Dobbs, Law of Remedies, at 660.[8] Petitioners could introduce evidence on remand to show\nsuch loss.For purposes of determining whether this case is\nmoot, the question is not whether petitioners would actually\nsucceed in obtaining such damages or whether their loss was\nsubstantial. If there is a possibility of obtaining damages in any\namount, the case is not moot.3One final point about damages must be\naddressed. We have warned in dicta that a claim of damages,\n\u201casserted solely to avoid otherwise certain mootness, [bears] close\ninspection.\u201dArizonans for Official Englishv.Arizona,520 U.S.\n43, 71 (1997). But if, after close inspection, we conclude that\nthe stringent test for mootness is not met, we have no authority to\ndismiss on that ground.Nothing inArizonans for Official Englishsuggests otherwise. In that case, the plaintiff, who was an\nemployee of the State of Arizona when she filed her complaint, sued\nthe State under \u00a71983, claiming that a state constitutional\namendment declaring English the official language of the State\nunconstitutionally prevented her from using Spanish to perform her\njob. Her requests for declaratory and injunctive relief became moot\nwhen she left state employment for the private sector, and we held\nthat her request for nominal damages from the State did not save\nher case from mootness since a State may not be sued under \u00a71983.\n520 U.\u00a0S., at 67\u201369, 71. The situation here is different\nbecause nothing blocks an award of nominal damages from a\ncity.[9]CRelief would be particularly appropriate here\nbecause the City\u2019s litigation strategy caused petitioners to incur\nwhat are surely very substantial attorney\u2019s fees in challenging the\nconstitutionality of a City ordinance that the City went to great\nlengths to defend.[10] Of\ncourse, a claim for attorney\u2019s fees is not alone sufficient to\npreserve a live controversy.Lewisv.Continental Bank\nCorp.,494\nU.S. 472, 480 (1990). But where a live controversy remains, a\ndefendant who would otherwise be liable for attorney\u2019s fees should\nnot be able to wiggle out on the basis of a spurious claim of\nmootness.If a \u00a71983 plaintiff achievesany success on\nthe merits, even an award of nominal damages, the plaintiff is\na prevailing party and is eligible for attorney\u2019s fees under 42\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71988. SeeBuckhannon Board & Care\nHome,Inc.v.West Virginia Dept. of Health and Human\nResources,532 U.S.\n598, 603 (2001). For this reason, were the Court to exercise\njurisdiction in this case and rule for petitioners, they would be\neligible for attorney\u2019s fees. SeeFarrarv.Hobby,506 U.S.\n103, 109 (1992).On the other hand, dismissing the case as moot\nmeans that petitioners are stuck with the attorney\u2019s fees they\nincurred in challenging a rule that the City ultimately\nabandoned\u2014and which it now admits was not needed for public safety.\nThat is so because \u201c[a] defendant\u2019s voluntary change in conduct,\nalthough perhaps accomplishing what the plaintiff sought to achieve\nby the lawsuit, lacks the necessary\njudicialimprimaturon the change.\u201dBuckhannon, 532 U.\u00a0S., at 605.Section 1988 attorney\u2019s fees are an important\ncomponent of civil rights enforcement. Seeid., at 635\u2013638\n(Ginsburg, J., dissenting). The prospect of an award of attorney\u2019s\nfees ensures that \u201cprivate attorneys general\u201d can enforce the civil\nrights laws through civil litigation, even if they \u201c\u00a0\u2018cannot\nafford legal counsel.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId., at 635\u2013636.Here, the City fought petitioners tooth and nail\nin the District Court and the Court of Appeals, insisting that its\nold ordinance served important public safety purposes. When\npetitioners sought review in this Court, the City opposed\ncertiorari on the same ground. But once we granted review, the City\nessentially attempted to impose a unilateral settlement that\ndeprived petitioners of attorney\u2019s fees. And those fees would\nlikely be substantial. They would reflect five years of intensive\nlitigation\u2014everything from the drafting of the complaint, through\nmultiple rounds of District Court motion practice, to appellate\nreview, and proceedings in this Court.IIITheper curiamprovides no sound reason\nfor holding that this case is moot. Theper curiamstates\nthat the City\u2019s current rule gave petitioners \u201cthe precise relief\n[they] requested\u201d in their prayer for relief,ante,at 1,\nbut that is not so. Petitioners\u2019 prayer for relief asks the court\nto enjoin 38 N.\u00a0Y.\u00a0C. R. R. \u00a75\u201323 insofar as it\n\u201cprohibit[s]\u201d travel outside the City to ranges, competitions, and\nsecond homes. App. 48. The new rule\u2019s conditions unmistakably\ncontinue to prohibit some travel outside the City to those\ndestinations. For this reason, petitioners have not obtained the\n\u201cunrestricted access\u201d that, they have always maintained, the Second\nAmendment guarantees.Id.,at 36. Theper curiamimplies that the current rule, as interpreted at oral argument by\ncounsel for the City, gives petitioners everything that they now\nseek,ante, at 1, but that also is not true. Petitioners\nstill claim the right to \u201cunrestricted access\u201d and counsel\u2019s\noff-the-cuff concessions do not give them that.[11]Theper curiam\u2019s main argument appears to\ngo as follows: Petitioners\u2019 original claim was a challenge to New\nYork\u2019s old rule; this claim is now moot due to the repeal of that\nrule; and what the petitioners are now asserting is a new claim,\nnamely, that New York\u2019s current rule is also unconstitutional.This argument also misrepresents the nature of\nthe claim asserted in petitioners\u2019 complaint. What petitioners\nclaimed in their complaint and still claim is that they are\nentitled to \u201cunrestricted access\u201d to out-of-city ranges and\ncompetitions. App.36. The City\u2019s replacement of one law\ndenying unrestricted access with another that also denies that\naccess did not change the nature of petitioners\u2019 claim or render it\nmoot.Consider where acceptance of the argument\nadopted by theper curiamleads. Suppose that a city\ncouncil, seeking to suppress a local paper\u2019s opposition to some of\nits programs, adopts an ordinance prohibiting the publication of\nany editorial without the approval of a city official. Suppose that\na newspaper challenges the constitutionality of this rule, arguing\nthat the First Amendment confers the unrestricted right to\neditorialize without prior approval. If the council then repeals\nits ordinance and replaces it with a new one requiring approval\nonly if the editorial concerns one particular city program, would\nthat render the pending lawsuit moot and require the paper to\ncommence a new one?Or take this example. A State enacts a law\nproviding that any woman wishing to obtain an abortion must submit\ncertification from five doctors that the procedure is medically\nnecessary. After a woman sues, claiming that any requirement of\nphysician certification is unconstitutional, the State replaces its\nold law with a new one requiring certification by three physicians.\nWould the court be required to dismiss the woman\u2019s suit? Suppose\nthe court, following the precedent set by today\u2019s decision, holds\nthat the case is moot, and suppose that the woman brings a second\ncase challenging the new law on the same ground. If the State\nrepeals that law and replaces it with one requiring certification\nby two doctors, would the second suit be moot? And what if the\nState responds to a third suit by enacting replacement legislation\ndemanding certification by one doctor?Mootness doctrine does not require such results.\nA challenge to an allegedly unconstitutional law does not become\nmoot with the enactment of new legislation that reduces but does\nnot eliminate the injury originally alleged. And that is the\nsituation here.The Court cites one case in support of its\nholding,Lewisv.Continental Bank Corp.,494 U.S.\n472, 482\u2013483 (1990), but that decision is wholly inapposite.\nThe situation inLewiswas complicated, but the critical\npoint for present purposes is that, by the time the case reached\nthis Court, the enactment of new legislation meant that the\nplaintiff no longer had Article III standing to assert its original\nclaim.Id., at 478\u2013479. But instead of simply ordering that\nthe case be dismissed, the Court remanded to give the plaintiff the\nopportunity to assert a different claim and, if necessary, to amend\nthe complaint or \u201cdevelop the record\u201d to show it had standing to\npursue this new claim.Id., at 482.The situation here is entirely different. It is\nnot disputed that petitioners have standing to contest the City\u2019s\nrestrictions on trips to out-of-city ranges and competitions, and\nas a result of those restrictions, petitioners have suffered and\nwill continue to suffer injury that is concrete, traceable to\nactions taken by the City, and remediable by a court. SeeSpokeo,Inc.v.Robins, 578 U.\u00a0S. ___\n(2016). They are not asserting a new claim. Their original\nclaim\u2014that they have the right under the Second Amendment to\nunrestricted access to out-of-city ranges and competitions\u2014is\nunchanged, and this claim does not require an amendment of the\ncomplaint or any supplementation of the record to support their\nallegations of injury.For these reasons, there is no justification for\nholding that this case is moot.IVAHaving shown that this case is not moot, I\nproceed to the merits of plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the City ordinance\nviolated the Second Amendment. This is not a close question. The\nanswer follows directly fromHeller.InHeller, we held that a District of\nColumbia rule that effectively prevented a law-abiding citizen from\nkeeping a handgun in the home for purposes of self-defense\nconstituted a core violation of the Second Amendment. 554\nU.\u00a0S., at 635. We based this decision on the scope of the\nright to keep and bear arms as it was understood at the time of the\nadoption of the Second Amendment.Id., at 577\u2013605, 628\u2013629.\nWe recognized that history supported the constitutionality of some\nlaws limiting the right to possess a firearm, such as laws banning\nfirearms from certain sensitive locations and prohibiting\npossession by felons and other dangerous individuals. Seeid., at 626\u2013627; see alsoMcDonald, 561 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 787, 904. But history provided no support for laws like the\nDistrict\u2019s. See 554 U.\u00a0S., at 629\u2013634.For a similar reason, 38 N.\u00a0Y.\u00a0C. R.\nR. \u00a75\u201323 also violated the Second Amendment. We deal here with the\nsame core Second Amendment right, the right to keep a handgun in\nthe home for self-defense. As the Second Circuit \u201cassume[d],\u201d a\nnecessary concomitant of this right is the right to take a gun\noutside the home for certain purposes. 883 F.\u00a03d, at 58\u201359.\nOne of these is to take a gun for maintenance or repair, which City\nlaw allows. See \u00a75\u201322(a)(16). Another is to take a gun outside the\nhome in order to transfer ownership lawfully, which the City also\nallows. \u00a75\u201326(j). And still another is to take a gun to a range in\norder to gain and maintain the skill necessary to use it\nresponsibly. As we said inHeller, \u201c\u00a0\u2018to bear arms\nimplies something more than the mere keeping [of arms]; it implies\nthe learning to handle and use them in a way that makes those who\nkeep them ready for their efficient use.\u2019\u00a0\u201d 554 U.\u00a0S., at\n617\u2013618 (quoting T. Cooley, Constitutional Law 271 (1880)); see\nalsoLuisv.UnitedStates, 578 U.\u00a0S.\n___, ___ (2016) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment) (slip op., at\n3) (\u201cThe right to keep and bear arms .\u00a0.\u00a0. \u2018implies a\ncorresponding right .\u00a0.\u00a0. to acquire and maintain\nproficiency in their use\u2019\u00a0\u201d);Ezellv.Chicago,\n651 F.3d 684, 704 (CA7 2011) (\u201c[T]he core right wouldn\u2019t mean much\nwithout the training and practice that make it effective\u201d).It is true that a lawful gun owner can sometimes\npractice at a range using a gun that is owned by and rented at the\nrange. But the same model gun that the person owns may not be\navailable at a range, and in any event each individual gun may have\nits own characteristics. See Brief for Professors of Second\nAmendment Law et\u00a0al. asAmici Curiae10\u201312; see also\nApp. 51, 56, 59 (referencing differences across ranges and shooting\ncompetitions).Once it is recognized that the right at issue is a\nconcomitant of the same right recognized inHeller, it\nbecame incumbent on the City to justify the restrictions its rule\nimposes, but the City has not done so. It points to no evidence of\nlaws in force around the time of the adoption of the Second\nAmendment that prevented gun owners from practicing outside city\nlimits. The City argues that municipalities restricted the places\nwithin their jurisdiction where a gun could be fired, Brief for\nRespondents 18, and it observes that the Second Amendment surely\ndoes not mean that a New York City resident with a premises license\ncan practice in Central Park or Times Square,id., at 21.\nThat is certainly true, but that is not the question. Petitioners\ndo not claim the right to fire weapons in public placeswithin\nthe City. Instead, they claim they have a right to practice at\nranges and competitionsoutside the City, and neither the\nCity, the courts below, nor any of the manyamicisupporting\nthe City have shown that municipalities during the founding era\nprevented gun owners from taking their guns outside city limits for\npractice.BIf history is not sufficient to show that the\nNew York City ordinance is unconstitutional, any doubt is dispelled\nby the weakness of the City\u2019s showing that its travel restriction\nsignificantly promoted public safety. Although the courts below\nclaimed to apply heightened scrutiny, there was nothing heightened\nabout what they did.As noted, the City relied entirely on the\ndeclaration of Inspector Lunetta, but this declaration provides\nlittle support. Seesupra, at 9\u201310. Some of what Inspector\nLunetta asserted was simply not relevant to the justification for\ndrawing a distinction between trips to a range in the City and\ntrips to a range in a neighboring jurisdiction. For example, he\nstated that persons holding premises licenses \u201cdo not always\ntransport their firearms in a locked box carrying ammunition\nseparately, as required by NYPD rules,\u201d but the issue in this case\ndoes not concern the storage of a gun on the way to a range. App.\n77\u201378. Similarly, he declared that \u201c[p]remises license holders have\nnot demonstrated proper cause to carry a concealed firearm in\npublic,\u201did., at 78, but the question before us is not\nwhether petitioners have the right to do what they could if they\nhad carry licenses.Other statements actually undermine the City\u2019s\npublic safety rationale. Thus, the fact that prosecutors typically\ndo not bring even misdemeanor charges against licensees who carry a\nweapon in violation of the limitations of their licenses,ibid., does not suggest that the City regards violations as\npresenting a particularly significant threat to public safety.When all that is irrelevant is brushed aside,\nwhat remains are the three arguments noted earlier. First,\nInspector Lunetta asserted that the travel restrictions discouraged\nlicensees from taking their guns outside the home, but this is a\nstrange argument for several reasons. It would make sense only if\nit is less convenient or more expensive to practice at a range in\nthe City, but that contradicts the City\u2019s argument that the seven\nranges in the City provide ample opportunity for practice. And\ndiscouraging trips to a range contradicts the City\u2019s own rule\nrecommending that licensees practice. Once it is recognized that a\nreasonable opportunity to practice is part of the very right\nrecognized inHeller, what this justification amounts to is\na repudiation of part of what we held in that decision.Second, Inspector Lunetta claimed that\nprohibiting trips to out-of-city ranges helps prevent a person who\nis taking a gun to a range from using it in a fit of rage after an\nauto accident or some other altercation that occurs along the way.\nAnd to bolster this argument, Inspector Lunetta asserted that\npersons who have met the City\u2019s demanding requirements for\nobtaining a premises license are just as likely as anyone else to\nuse their guns in a fit of rage. App. 77. If that is so, it does\nnot reflect well on the City\u2019s intensive vetting scheme, seesupra, at 4\u20136, and in any event, the assertion is dubious on\nits face.More to the point, this argument does not\nexplain why a person headed for a range outside the City is any\nmore likely to engage in such conduct than a person whose\ndestination is a range in the City. There might besomethingto the argument if ranges in the City were closer than those just\noutside its borders, but the City never attempted to show that. The\ncourts below were incurious about the validity of Inspector\nLunetta\u2019s assertion, and given the location of the City\u2019s seven\nranges, the assertion is more than dubious.[12]Inspector Lunetta\u2019s final justification for the\ntravel restrictions was only marginally stronger. It goes like\nthis. Suppose that a patrol officer stops a premises licensee and\nfinds that this individual is carrying a gun, and suppose that that\nthe licensee says he is taking the gun to a range to practice or is\nreturning from a range. If the range in question is one in the\nCity, the officer will be better able to check the story than if\nthe range is outside the officer\u2019s jurisdiction. App. 79\u201380.How strong is this argument? The City presumably\nhas access to records of cases in which licensees were cited for\nunauthorized possession of guns outside the home, and it failed to\nprovide any evidence that holders of target licenses had used their\nright to practice at out-of-city ranges as a pretext. And it is\ndubious that it would be much harder for an officer to check\nwhether a licensee was really headed for an out-of-city range as\nopposed to one in the City. If a licensee claims to be headed for a\nrange in the City, the officer can check whether the range is open\nand whether the individual appears to be on a route that plausibly\nleads to that range. But how much more difficult would it be to do\nthe same thing if the range is in one of the counties that border\nNew York City or across the Hudson River in New Jersey? A phone\ncall would be enough to determine the range\u2019s operating hours, and\nthe route would still be easy to determine: There are only a few\nbridges and tunnels to New Jersey and just a few main thoroughfares\nto the neighboring New York counties. A court conducting any form\nof serious scrutiny would have demanded that the City provide some\nsubstantiation for this claim, but nothing like that was provided\nor demanded.Would the situation be much different if the\nindividual claimed to be headed home from a range? Once again, it\nwould not be difficult for the officer to check whether the range\nwas or recently had been open. And it is not at all apparent that\ndetermining whether a licensee was on a route to his or her\nresidence would be any harder if the range at which the licensee\nclaimed to have practiced was outside the City.Inspector Lunetta\u2019s declaration stated that\nranges in the City are required to keep a record of everyone who\npractices there, and therefore if a person claims to be coming from\na city range, the officer could easily check that story. But the\ndeclaration does not state that ranges in nearby jurisdictions do\nnot keep similar records.[13] It should have been easy enough for the City to\ncheck, and a court engaged in any serious form of scrutiny would\nhave questioned the absence of evidence, but no substantiation was\nprovided or demanded below.In sum, the City\u2019s travel restriction burdened\nthe very right recognized inHeller. History provides no\nsupport for a restriction of this type. The City\u2019s public safety\narguments were weak on their face, were not substantiated in any\nway, and were accepted below with no serious probing. And once we\ngranted review in this case, the City\u2019s public safety concerns\nevaporated.We are told that the mode of review in this case\nis representative of the wayHellerhas been treated in the\nlower courts. If that is true, there is cause for concern.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*This case is not moot. The City violated\npetitioners\u2019 Second Amendment right, and we should so hold. I would\nreverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case to\nthe District Court to provide appropriate relief. I therefore\nrespectfully dissent.Notes1See Brief for Second\nAmendment Law Professors et al. asAmici Curiae8\u20139.2The last census found\nthat there were 3,109,784 households in the City. D. Gaquin &\nM. Ryan, County and City Extra: Special Decennial Census Edition\n607 (2012).3In one case, the\nviolation charged was transporting a loaded gun.Peoplev.Schumann, 133 Misc. 2d 499, 507 N.Y.S.2d 349 (Crim.

At\nsummary judgment, petitioners asked that the District Court declare\n38 N.\u00a0Y.\u00a0C. R.

SeeFlanigan\u2019s Enterprises, Inc.of Ga. v.Sandy Springs,868 F.3d 1248 (CA11 2017). But that holding\nis difficult to reconcile withCareyandStachura\u2019s\nendorsement of nominal damages as an appropriate constitutional\nremedy.7Even if specific\nallegations in the complaint were necessary, the District Court\ncould allow amendment. SeeZenith Radio Corp. v.Hazeltine Research, Inc.,401 U.S.\n321, 331 (1971); 6 Wright & Miller \u00a71474 (3d ed.\n2010).8For example, inBrooksv.Andolina, 826 F.2d 1266 (1987), the Third\nCircuit held that a prisoner could seek damages for various\ndeprivations suffered during punitive segregation imposed in\nretaliation for the exercise of his free speech rights.Id.,at 1270. These injuries included loss of visiting and phone\nprivileges, recreation rights, and access to the law library. InYoungv.LittleRock,249 F.3d 730(2001), the Eighth Circuit affirmed a jury award\nof compensatory damages for wrongful detention that caused\npsychological harm.Id.,at 736. InDrakev.Lawrence,524 N.E.2d 337(1988), the Indiana Court of Appeals affirmed a\ncompensatory damages award for, among other things, the\nembarrassment of a false arrest in front of an employee and\ncustomer and the anxiety associated with pending charges.Id., at 342. InWatsekav.Illinois Public Action\nCouncil, 796 F.2d 1547 (1986), aff\u00a0\u2019d, 479 U.S. 1048\n(1987), the Seventh Circuit affirmed an award of damages for\n\u201cspecific compensable, non-abstract harm\u201d resulting from an\nunconstitutional ordinance restricting door-to-door solicitation.\nThat harm included the organization\u2019s inability to recruit new\nmembers, disseminate its views, and encourage others to support its\npositions. 796 F.\u00a02d, at 1558\u20131559; see also,e.g.,Kingv.Zamiara, 788 F.3d 207, 213\u2013214 (CA6 2015)\n(affirming compensatory damages award for injury caused by transfer\nof inmate in retaliation for filing lawsuit, when transfer impeded\nhis ability to participate in litigation).9Theper curiamrefuses to decide whether petitioners have a live claim for\ndamages, claiming that the lower courts should determine in the\nfirst instance whether any effort to recover damages has come \u201ctoo\nlate.\u201dAnte,at 2. But as previously discussed, seesupra,at 15\u201316, prejudice is the critical factor in\ndetermining whether to permit a late request for a form of relief\nnot expressly demanded in a complaint, and theper curiamdoes not identify any reason why allowing petitioners\u2019 request for\ndamages at this juncture would prejudice the City. Under the\nCourt\u2019s decision, allowing damages will not prolong this\nlitigation, because the case is being remanded anyway, and there is\nno suggestion that the City would have litigated the case any\ndifferently if it had been on express notice that petitioners were\nseeking the sort of modest damages discussed in this\nopinion.10Attorney\u2019s fees are specifically\nrequested in the amended complaint. App. 48.11The\nCity\u2019s enforcement position as to \u201ccoffee, gas, food, or restroom\nbreaks\u201d by no means resolves the meaning of \u00a75\u201323. The City\u2019s\ncounsel informed the Court that those stops are permissible because\nthey are \u201creasonably necessary\u201d under the new rule. Tr. of Oral\nArg. 64\u201365. But what that means is far from clear, and, at any\nrate, coffee breaks and the like are just illustrative examples of\npotential ways in which the new rule affords something less than\nunfettered access to gun ranges, competitions, and second homes\noutside the City. Seesupra,at 13.12Two\nof the seven City ranges (28%) were located in Staten Island (home\nto under 6% of the City\u2019s residents), and the trip there from the\nother boroughs is not quick. Another range (the only one open to\nthe public) was located in the north Bronx. See Brief for\nAppellants in No. 15\u2013638, p.\u00a032 (CA2) (explaining that, for\nplaintiff Colantone, \u201ctraveling from his home in Staten Island to\nthe authorized range Olinville Arms in the Bronx[ involves] a far\nlonger drive\u201d than to a shooting club in New Jersey).13Inspector Lunetta also expressed\nconcern that officers in other jurisdictions might detect and\nreport fewer license violations. App. 80. But Inspector Lunetta did\nnot support this prediction, and his declaration gives reason to\ndoubt whether a decrease in referrals will actually occur. Lunetta\nexplains that the NYPD License Division already receives \u201creports\nfrom [the New York State Division of Criminal Justice System]\nregarding all arrests made within the State of New York for which\nan arrestee is fingerprinted.\u201dId.,at 86. But \u201c[n]o formal\nreport is forwarded to the License Division for summonses and other\narrests and incidents for which a detainee is not fingerprinted.\u201dIbid.\u201c[T]he License Division may be, but is not always,\nnotified of an arrest\u201d made by the Federal Government or\nauthorities in another State.Ibid.By Lunetta\u2019s own\naccount, the NYPD already appears reliant on the State\nfingerprinting database to detect violations in other\njurisdictions. There is no reason to expect that database to be any\nless effective today in alerting the License Division to potential\nviolations than it was under the old ordinance.",
