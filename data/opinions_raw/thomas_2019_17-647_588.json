    "text": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES_________________No. 17\u2013647_________________ROSE MARY KNICK, PETITIONERv.TOWNSHIP\nOF SCOTT, PENNSYLVANIA, et\u00a0al.on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the third circuit[June 21, 2019]Justice Thomas, concurring.The Fifth Amendment\u2019s Takings Clause prohibits\nthe government from \u201ctak[ing]\u201d private property \u201cwithout just\ncompensation.\u201d The Court correctly interprets this text by holding\nthat a violation of this Clause occurs as soon as the government\ntakes property without paying for it.The United States, by contrast, urges us not to\nenforce the Takings Clause as written. It worries that requiring\npayment to accompany a taking would allow courts to enjoin or\ninvalidate broad regulatory programs \u201cmerely\u201d because the program\ntakes property without paying for it. Brief for United States asAmicus Curiae12. According to the United States, \u201cthere is\na \u2018nearly infinite variety of ways in which government actions or\nregulations can affect property interests,\u2019\u00a0\u201d and it ought to\nbe good enough that the government \u201cimplicitly promises to pay\ncompensation for any taking\u201d if a property owner successfully sues\nthe government in court. Supplemental Letter Brief for United\nStates asAmicus Curiae5 (Supp. Brief) (citing the Tucker\nAct, 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71491). Government officials, the United\nStates contends, should be able to implement regulatory programs\n\u201cwithout fear\u201d of injunction or invalidation under the Takings\nClause, \u201ceven when\u201d the program is so far reaching that the\nofficials \u201ccannot determine whether a taking will occur.\u201d Supp.\nBrief 5.This \u201csue me\u201d approach to the Takings Clause is\nuntenable. The Fifth Amendment does not merely provide a damages\nremedy to a property owner willing to \u201cshoulder the burden of\nsecuring compensation\u201d after the government takes property without\npaying for it.Arrigoni Enterprises, LLCv.Durham,\n578 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2016) (Thomas, J., dissenting from denial\nof certiorari) (slip op., at 2). Instead, it makes just\ncompensation a \u201cprerequisite\u201d to the government\u2019s authority to\n\u201ctak[e] property for public use.\u201dIbid.A \u201cpurported\nexercise of the eminent-domain power\u201d is therefore \u201cinvalid\u201d unless\nthe government \u201cpays just compensation before or at the time of its\ntaking.\u201dId., at ___ (slip op., at 3). If this requirement\nmakes some regulatory programs \u201cunworkable in practice,\u201d Supp.\nBrief 5, so be it\u2014our role is to enforce the Takings Clause as\nwritten.Of course, as the Court correctly explains, the\nUnited States\u2019 concerns about injunctions may be misplaced.Ante,at 15\u201318. Injunctive relief is not available when an\nadequate remedy exists at law.E.g.,Monsanto Co.v.Geertson Seed Farms,561 U.S.\n139, 156 (2010). And even when relief is appropriate for a\nparticular plaintiff, it does not follow that a court may enjoin or\ninvalidate an entire regulatory \u201cprogram,\u201d Supp. Brief 5, by\ngranting relief \u201cbeyond the parties to the case,\u201dTrumpv.Hawaii, 585 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2018) (Thomas, J.,\nconcurring) (slip op., at 6); seeid., at ___ (slip op., at\n2) (expressing skepticism about \u201cuniversal injunctions\u201d).Still, \u201c[w]hen the government repudiates [its]\nduty\u201d to pay just compensation, its actions \u201care not only\nunconstitutional\u201d but may be \u201ctortious as well.\u201dMontereyv.Del Monte Dunes at Monterey, Ltd.,526\nU.S. 687, 717 (1999) (plurality opinion). I do not understand\nthe Court\u2019s opinion to foreclose the application of ordinary\nremedial principles to takings claims and related common-law tort\nclaims, such as trespass. I therefore join it in full.",
