Importantly, the Court does not today decide\nwhether an order resolving the merits of an FTCA claim precludes\nother claims arising out of the same subject matter in the same\nsuit. Although the parties briefed the issue, it was not the basis\nof the lower court\u2019s decision. Seeante,at 5, n.\u00a04. I\nwrite separately to emphasize that, while many lower courts have\nuncritically held that the FTCA\u2019s judgment bar applies to claims\nbrought in the same action, there are reasons to question that\nconclusion. This issue merits far closer consideration than it has\nthus far received.King argues that the judgment bar merely\n\u201csupplements common-law claim preclusion by closing a narrow gap,\u201d\npreventing plaintiffs from bringing duplicative litigation against\nfirst the United States and then its employees.Simmonsv.Himmelreich, 578 U.S. 621, 630, n. 5 (2016); see alsoibid.(\u201cAt the time that the FTCA was passed, common-law\nclaim preclusion would have barred a plaintiff from suing the\nUnited States after having sued an employee but not vice versa\u201d).\nOn petitioners\u2019 view, however, the judgment bar provides that any\norder resolving an FTCA claim automatically precludes separate\nclaims brought in the same action and arising from the same common\nnucleus of facts. This is a significant departure from the normal\noperation of common-law claim preclusion, which applies only in\nseparate or subsequent suits following a final judgment. See,e.g.,G. & C. Merriam Co.v.Saalfield\u00b8241 U.S.\n22, 29 (1916) (\u201cObviously, the rule for decision applies only\nwhen the subsequent action has been brought\u201d).King raises a number of reasons to doubt\npetitioners\u2019 reading. Looking first to the text, the FTCA\u2019s\njudgment bar is triggered by \u201c[t]he judgment in an action under\nsection 1346(b).\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a72676. A \u201cjudgment\u201d is \u201c[a] court\u2019s\nfinal determination of the rights and obligations of the parties in\na case.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1007 (11th ed. 2019); see also 1 H.\nBlack, Law of Judgments \u00a71, p. 2, n. l (1891) (\u201c\u00a0\u2018A judgment\nis the final consideration and determination of a court\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. upon the matters submitted to it\u2019\u00a0\u201d).\nDecisions disposing of only some of the claims in a lawsuit are not\n\u201cjudgments.\u201dSimilarly, once the judgment bar is triggered,\nit precludes \u201cany action by the claimant.\u201d \u00a72676. An \u201caction\u201d\nrefers to the whole of the lawsuit. See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, at\n37 (defining \u201caction\u201d as a \u201ccivil or criminal judicial\nproceeding\u201d); Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 43 (3d ed. 1933) (\u201cThe terms\n\u2018action\u2019 and \u2018suit\u2019 are now nearly, if not entirely, synonymous\u201d).\nIndividual demands for relief within a lawsuit, by contrast, are\n\u201cclaims.\u201d See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, at 311 (2019) (defining a\n\u201cclaim\u201d as \u201cthe part of a complaint in a civil action specifying\nwhat relief the plaintiff asks for\u201d); Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, at\n333 (1933) (defining a \u201cclaim\u201d as \u201cany demand held or asserted as\nof right\u201d or \u201ccause of action\u201d).Thus, giving the judgment bar\u2019s two key terms\ntheir traditional meanings, \u201cthe judgment in an action under\nsection 1346(b)\u201d that triggers the bar is the final order resolving\nevery claim in a lawsuit that includes FTCA claims. When triggered,\nthe judgment bar precludes later \u201caction[s],\u201d not claims in the\nsame suit. So read, the statutory judgment bar \u201cfunctions in much\nthe same way\u201d as claim preclusion, \u201cwith both rules depending on a\nprior judgment as a condition precedent.\u201dWillv.Hallock,546 U.S.\n345, 354 (2006).[1]Turning next to the FTCA\u2019s purpose and effect,\nunder King\u2019s reading, the judgment bar also serves the same,\nfamiliar functions as claim preclusion: \u201cavoiding duplicative\nlitigation\u201d by barring repetitive suits against employees without\n\u201creflecting a policy that a defendant should be scot free of any\nliability.\u201dIbid.Petitioners\u2019 interpretation, by contrast,\nappears inefficient. Precluding claims brought in the same suit\nincentivizes plaintiffs to bring separate suits, first against\nfederal employees directly and second against the United States\nunder the FTCA. SeeSterlingv.United States,85 F.3d 1225, 1228\u20131229 (CA7 1996) (holding that judgment in a\nprior direct action did not preclude a later FTCA suit against the\nUnited States).[2]Petitioners\u2019 interpretation also produces\nseemingly unfair results by precluding potentially meritorious\nclaims when a plaintiff\u2019s FTCA claims fail for unrelated reasons.\nHere, for example, King\u2019s constitutional claims require only a\nshowing that the officers\u2019 behavior was objectively unreasonable,\nwhile the District Court held that the state torts underlying\nKing\u2019s FTCA claims require subjective bad faith. If petitioners are\nright, King\u2019s failure to show bad faith, which is irrelevant to his\nconstitutional claims, means a jury will never decide whether the\nofficers violated King\u2019s constitutional rights when they stopped,\nsearched, and hospitalized him.There are, of course, counterarguments. On the\ntext, petitioners point out that it would be strange to refer to\nthe entire lawsuit as \u201can action under section 1346(b)\u201d even after\nthe Court has decided all the claims brought under the FTCA.\nBetter, they argue, to read \u201cjudgment in an action under section\n1346(b)\u201d to mean any order resolving all the FTCA claims in the\nsuit. They urge further that claims in the same suit should be\namong the covered actions because the bar precludes \u201cany action,\u201d\nrather than \u201csubsequent\u201d actions, which is the typical formulation\nof claim preclusion. As to the judgment bar\u2019s purpose, petitioners\ncontend that the FTCA gives tort claimants a choice that comes with\na cost: They can sue the United States and access its deeper\npockets, but, if they do, then the outcome of the FTCA claims\nresolves the entire controversy. This preserves federal resources\nwhile allowing tort claimants to decide whether to bring FTCA\nclaims at all.There are naturally counterarguments to those\ncounterarguments, and so on, but further elaboration here is\nunnecessary. As the Court points out, \u201c\u00a0\u2018we are a court of\nreview, not of first view.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAnte,at 5, n.\u00a04\n(quotingCutterv.Wilkinson,544\nU.S. 709, 718, n.\u00a07 (2005)). While lower courts have\nlargely taken petitioners\u2019 view of the judgment bar, few have\nexplained how its text or purpose compels that result. In my view,\nthis question deserves much closer analysis and, where appropriate,\nreconsideration.Notes1Nearby \u00a72672 could\nfurther support this interpretation. That section provides that an\nadministrative settlement with the United States \u201cshall constitute\na complete release of any claim against the United States and\nagainst the employee of the government\u201d who committed the tort.\nUnlike the judgment bar, \u00a72672 uses unambiguous language (\u201crelease\nof any claim\u201d) to ensure that settlements with the United States\nboth preclude future litigation and resolve pending claims against\nfederal employees. Had Congress intended to give both provisions\nthe same effect, \u201cit presumably would have done so expressly.\u201dRussellov.United States,464 U.S.\n16, 23 (1983).2Some courts have held\nthat precluding claims in the same action prevents plaintiffs from\nrecovering for the same injury from both the United States and the\nfederal employee. The law, however, already bars double recovery\nfor the same injury. See,e.g.,Zenith Radio Corp.v.Hazeltine Research, Inc.,401 U.S.\n321, 348 (1971) (\u201c[T]he law .\u00a0.\u00a0. does not permit a\nplaintiff to recover double payment\u201d).",
