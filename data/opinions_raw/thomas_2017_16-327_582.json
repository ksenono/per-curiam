    "text": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES_________________No. 16\u2013327_________________JAE LEE, PETITIONERv.UNITED\nSTATESon writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the sixth circuit[June 23, 2017]Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Alito joins\nexcept for Part I, dissenting.The Court today holds that a defendant can undo\na guilty plea, well after sentencing and in the face of\noverwhelming evidence of guilt, because he would have chosen to\npursue a defense at trial with no reasonable chance of success if\nhis attorney had properly advised him of the immigration\nconsequences of his plea. Neither the Sixth Amendment nor this\nCourt\u2019s precedents support that conclusion. I respectfully\ndissent.IAs an initial matter, I remain of the view\nthat the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution does not \u201crequir[e]\ncounsel to provide accurate advice concerning the potential removal\nconsequences of a guilty plea.\u201dPadillav.Kentucky,\n559 U.\u00a0S. 356, 388 (2010) (Scalia, J., joined by Thomas, J.,\ndissenting). I would therefore affirm the Court of Appeals on the\nground that the Sixth Amendment does not apply to the allegedly\nineffective assistance in this case.IIBecause the Court today announces a novel\nstandard for prejudice at the plea stage, I further dissent on the\nseparate ground that its standard does not follow from our\nprecedents.AThe Court and both of the parties agree that\nthe prejudice inquiry in this context is governed byStricklandv.Washington, 466 U.\u00a0S. 668 (1984) .\nSeeante,at 5; Brief for Petitioner 16; Brief for United\nStates 15. The Court inStricklandheld that a defendant may\nestablish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel by showing\nthat his \u201ccounsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard\nof reasonableness\u201d and, as relevant here, that the representation\nprejudiced the defendant by \u201cactually ha[ving] an adverse effect on\nthe defense.\u201d 466 U.\u00a0S., at 688, 693.To establish prejudice underStrickland,\na defendant must show a \u201creasonable probability that, but for\ncounsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would\nhave been different.\u201dId.,at 694.Stricklandmade\nclear that the \u201cresult of the proceeding\u201d refers to the outcome of\nthe defendant\u2019s criminal prosecution as a whole. It defined\n\u201creasonable probability\u201d as \u201ca probability sufficient to undermine\nconfidencein the outcome.\u201dIbid.(emphasis added).\nAnd it explained that \u201c[a]n error by counsel .\u00a0.\u00a0. does\nnot warrant setting aside the judgment of a criminal proceeding if\nthe error had no effecton the judgment.\u201dId.,at 691\n(emphasis added).The parties agree that this inquiry assumes an\n\u201cobjective\u201d decisionmaker. Brief for Petitioner 17; Brief for\nUnited States 17. That conclusion also follows directly fromStrickland. According toStrickland, the \u201cassessment\nof the likelihood of a result more favorable to the defendant must\nexclude the possibility of arbitrariness, whimsy, caprice,\n\u2018nullification,\u2019 and the like.\u201d 466 U.\u00a0S., at 695. It does not\ndepend on subjective factors such as \u201cthe idiosyncrasies of the\nparticular decisionmaker,\u201d including the decisionmaker\u2019s \u201cunusual\npropensities toward harshness or leniency.\u201dIbid.These\nfactors are flatly \u201cirrelevant to the prejudice inquiry.\u201dIbid.In other words, \u201c[a] defendant has no entitlement to\nthe luck of a lawless decisionmaker.\u201dIbid.Instead, \u201c[t]he\nassessment of prejudice should proceed on the assumption that the\ndecisionmaker is reasonably, conscientiously, and impartially\napplying the standards that govern the decision.\u201dIbid.When the Court extended the right to effective\ncounsel to the plea stage, seeHillv.Lockhart, 474\nU.\u00a0S. 52 (1985) , it held that \u201cthe same two-part standard\u201d\nfromStricklandapplies. 474 U.\u00a0S., at 57 (repeatingStrickland\u2019s teaching that even an unreasonable error by\ncounsel \u201c\u00a0\u2018does not warrant setting aside the judgment\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nso long as the error \u201c\u00a0\u2018had no effect on the judgment\u2019\u00a0\u201d\n(quoting 466 U.\u00a0S., at 691)). To be sure, the Court said\u2014and\nthe majority today emphasizes\u2014that a defendant asserting an\nineffectiveness claim at the plea stage \u201cmust show that there is a\nreasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, he would not\nhave pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.\u201d 474\nU.\u00a0S., at 59. But that requirement merely reflects the reality\nthat a defendant cannot show that the outcome of his case would\nhave been different if he would have accepted his current plea\nanyway.[1]* In other words, the\ndefendant\u2019s ability to show that he would have gone to trial is\nnecessary, but not sufficient, to establish prejudice.TheHillCourt went on to explain thatStrickland\u2019s two-part test applies the same way in the plea\ncontext as in other contexts. In particular, the \u201cassessment\u201d will\nprimarily turn on \u201ca prediction whether,\u201d in the absence of\ncounsel\u2019s error, \u201cthe evidence\u201d of the defendant\u2019s innocence or\nguilt \u201clikely would have changed the outcome\u201d of the proceeding.\n474 U.\u00a0S., at 59. Thus, a defendant cannot show prejudice\nwhere it is \u201c\u00a0\u2018inconceivable\u2019\u00a0\u201d not only that he would\nhave gone to trial, but also \u201c\u00a0\u2018thatif he had done sohe either would have been acquitted or, if convicted, would\nnevertheless have been given a shorter sentence than he actually\nreceived.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIbid.(quotingEvansv.Meyer,742 F.\u00a02d 371, 375 (CA7 1984) (emphasis added)).\nIn sum, the proper inquiry requires a defendant to show both that\nhe would have rejected his plea and gone to trialandthat\nhe would likely have obtained a more favorable result in the\nend.To the extentHillwas ambiguous about\nthe standard, our precedents applying it confirm this\ninterpretation. InPremov.Moore, 562 U.\u00a0S. 115\n(2011) , the Court emphasized that \u201cstrict adherence to theStricklandstandard\u201d is \u201cessential\u201d when reviewing claims\nabout attorney error \u201cat the plea bargain stage.\u201dId.,at\n125. In that case, the defendant argued that his counsel was\nconstitutionally ineffective because he had failed to seek\nsuppression of his confession before he pleaded no contest. In\nanalyzing the prejudice issue, the Court did not focus solely on\nwhether the suppression hearing would have turned out differ-ently,\nor whether the defendant would have chosen to go to trial. It\nfocused as well on the weight of the evidence against the defendant\nand the fact that he likely would not have obtained a more\nfavorable result at trial, regardless of whether he succeeded at\nthe suppression hearing. Seeid., at 129 (describing the\nState\u2019s case as \u201cformidable\u201d and observing that \u201c[t]he bargain\ncounsel struck\u201d in the plea agreement was \u201ca favorable one\u201d to the\ndefendant compared to what might have happened at trial).The Court inMissouriv.Frye, 566\nU.\u00a0S. 134 (2012) , took a similar approach. In that case, the\nCourt extendedHillto hold that counsel could be\nconstitutionally ineffective for failing to communicate a plea deal\nto a defendant. 566 U.\u00a0S., at 145. The Court emphasized that,\nin addition to showing a reasonable probability that the defendant\n\u201cwould have accepted the earlier plea offer,\u201d it is also\n\u201cnecessary\u201d to show a \u201creasonable probability that the end result\nof the criminal process would have been more favorable by reason of\na plea to a lesser charge or a sentence of less prison time.\u201dId., at 147; see alsoid.,at 150 (the defendant\n\u201cmust shownot onlya reasonable probability that he would\nhave accepted the lapsed pleabut alsoa reasonable\nprobability that the prosecution would have adhered to the\nagreement and that it would have been accepted by the trial court\u201d\n(emphasis added)). In short, the Court did not focus solely on\nwhether the defendant would have accepted the plea. It instead\nrequired the defendant to show that the ultimate outcome would have\nbeen different.Finally, the Court\u2019s decision inLaflerv.Cooper, 566 U.\u00a0S. 156 (2012) , is to the same\neffect. In that case, the Court concluded that counsel may be\nconstitutionally ineffective by causing a defendant to reject a\nplea deal he should have accepted.Id.,at 164. The Court\nagain emphasized that the prejudice inquiry requires a showing that\nthe criminal prosecution would ultimately have ended differently\nfor the defendant\u2014not merely that the defendant would have accepted\nthe deal. The Court stated that the defendant in those\ncircumstances \u201cmust show\u201d a reasonable probability that \u201cthe\nconviction or sentence, or both, under the offer\u2019s terms would have\nbeen less severe than under the judgment and sentence that in fact\nwere imposed.\u201dIbid.These precedents are consistent with our cases\ngoverning the right to effective assistance of counsel in other\ncontexts. This Court has held that the right to effective counsel\napplies to all \u201ccritical stages of the criminal proceedings.\u201dMontejov.Louisiana, 556 U.\u00a0S. 778, 786 (2009)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Those stages include not only\n\u201cthe entry of a guilty plea,\u201d but also \u201carraignments,\npostindictment interrogation, [and] postindictment lineups.\u201dFrye,supra, at 140 (citing cases). In those\ncircumstances, the Court has not held that the prejudice inquiry\nfocuses on whetherthatstage of the proceeding would have\nended differently. It instead has made clear that the prejudice\ninquiry is the same as inStrickland, which requires a\ndefendant to establish that he would have been better off in the\nend had his counsel not erred. See 466 U.\u00a0S., at 694.BThe majority misapplies this Court\u2019s\nprecedents when it concludes that a defendant may establish\nprejudice by showing only that \u201che would not have pleaded guilty\nand would have insisted on going to trial,\u201d without showing that\n\u201cthe result of that trial would have been different than the result\nof the plea bargain.\u201dAnte,at 5, 6 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). In reaching this conclusion, the Court relies\nalmost exclusively on the single line fromHillthat \u201cthe\ndefendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that,\nbut for counsel\u2019s errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and\nwould have insisted on going to trial.\u201d 474 U.\u00a0S., at 59. For\nthe reasons explained above, that sentence prescribes the threshold\nshowing a defendant must make to establishStricklandprejudice where a defendant has accepted a guilty plea. InHill, the Court concluded that the defendant had not made\nthat showing, so it rejected his claim. The Court did not, however,\nfurther hold that a defendant can establish prejudice by making\nthat showing alone.The majority also relies on a case that arises\nin a completely different context,Roev.Flores-Ortega, 528 U.\u00a0S. 470 (2000) . There, the Court\nconsidered a defendant\u2019s claim that his attorney failed to file a\nnotice of appeal. Seeid.,at 474. The Court observed that\nthe lawyer\u2019s failure to file the notice of appeal \u201carguably led not\nto a judicial proceeding of disputed reliability,\u201d but instead to\n\u201cthe forfeiture of a proceeding itself.\u201dId.,at 483. The\nCourt today observes that petitioner\u2019s guilty plea meant that he\ndid not go to trial.Ante,at 5. Because that trial\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018never took place,\u2019\u00a0\u201d the Court reasons, we cannot\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018apply a strong presumption of reliability\u2019\u00a0\u201d to it.Ante, at 5\u20136 (quotingFlores-Ortega,supra,at\n482\u2013483). And because the presumption of reliability does not\napply, we may not depend onStrickland\u2019s statement \u201cthat\n\u2018[a] defendant has no entitlement to the luck of a lawless\ndecisionmaker.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAnte,at 8 (quoting 466 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 695). This point is key to the majority\u2019s conclusion that\npetitioner would have chosen to gamble on a trial even though he\nhad no viable defense.The majority\u2019s analysis, however, is directly\ncontrary toHill, which instructed a court undertaking a\nprejudice analysis to apply a presumption of reliability to the\nhypothetical trial that would have occurred had the defendant not\npleaded guilty. After explaining that a court should engage in a\npredictive inquiry about the likelihood of a defendant securing a\nbetter result at trial, the Court said: \u201cAs we explained inStricklandv.Washington, supra,these predictions of\nthe outcome at a possible trial, where necessary, should be made\nobjectively, without regard for the \u2018idiosyncrasies of the\nparticular decisionmaker.\u2019\u00a0\u201d 474 U.\u00a0S., at 59\u201360 (quoting\n466 U.\u00a0S., at 695). That quote comes from the same paragraph\ninStricklandas the discussion about the presumption of\nreliability that attaches to the trial. In other words,Hillinstructs that the prejudice inquiry must presume that the foregone\ntrial would have been reliable.The majority responds thatHillmade\nstatements about presuming a reliable trial only in \u201cdiscussing how\ncourts should analyze \u2018predictions of the outcome at a possible\ntrial,\u2019\u00a0\u201d which \u201cwill not always be \u2018necessary.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAnte, at 10, n.\u00a03 (quotingHill, 474 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 59\u201360). I agree that such an inquiry is not always necessary\u2014it\nis not necessary where, as inHill, the defendant cannot\nshow at the threshold that he would have rejected his plea and\nchosen to go to trial. But that caveat says nothing about the\napplication of the presumption of reliability when a defendant can\nmake that threshold showing.In any event, the Court inHillrecognized that guilty pleas are themselves generally reliable.\nGuilty pleas \u201crarely\u201d give rise to the \u201cconcern that unfair\nprocedures may have resulted in the conviction of an innocent\ndefendant.\u201dId., at 58 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nThat is because \u201ca counseled plea of guilty is an admission of\nfactual guilt so reliable that, where voluntary and intelligent, it\nquite validly removes the issue of factual guilt from the case.\u201dMennav.New York, 423 U.\u00a0S. 61 , n.\u00a02\n(1975) (per curiam) (emphasis deleted). Guilty pleas, like\ncompleted trials, are therefore entitled to the protections against\ncollateral attack that theStricklandprejudice standard\naffords.Finally, the majority does not dispute that the\nprejudice inquiry inFryeandLaflerfocused on\nwhether the defendant established a reasonable probability of a\ndifferent outcome. The majority instead distinguishes those cases\non the ground that they involved a defendant who did not accept a\nguilty plea. Seeante, at 7, n. 1. According to the\nmajority, those cases \u201carticulated adifferentway to show\nprejudice, suited to the context of pleas not accepted.\u201dIbid. But the Court inFryeandLafler(andHill, for that matter) did not purport to establish a\n\u201cdifferent\u201d test for prejudice. To the contrary, the Court\nrepeatedly stated that it was applying the \u201csametwo-part\nstandard\u201d fromStrickland.Hill,supra, at 57\n(emphasis added); accord,Frye, 566, U.\u00a0S., at 140\n(\u201cHillestablished that claims of ineffective assistance of\ncounsel in the plea bargain context are governed by the two-part\ntest set forth inStrickland\u201d);Lafler, 566\nU.\u00a0S., at 162\u2013163 (applyingStrickland).The majority today abandons any pretense of\napplyingStricklandto claims of ineffective assistance of\ncounsel that arise at the plea stage. It instead concludes that one\nstandard applies when a defendant goes to trial\n(Strickland); another standard applies when a defendant\naccepts a plea (Hill); and yet another standard applies when\ncounsel does not apprise the defendant of an available plea or when\nthe defendant rejects a plea (FryeandLafler). That\napproach leaves little doubt that the Court has \u201copen[ed] a whole\nnew field of constitutionalized criminal\nprocedure\u201d\u2014\u201cplea-bargaining law\u201d\u2014despite its repeated assurances\nthat it has been applying the sameStricklandstandard all\nalong.Lafler,supra, at 175 (Scalia, J.,\ndissenting). In my view, we should take the Court\u2019s precedents at\ntheir word and conclude that \u201c[a]n error by counsel .\u00a0.\u00a0.\ndoes not warrant setting aside the judgment of a criminal\nproceeding if the error had no effect on the judgment.\u201dStrickland, 466, U.\u00a0S., at 691.IIIApplying the ordinaryStricklandstandard in this case, I do not think a defendant in petitioner\u2019s\ncircumstances could show a reasonable probability that the result\nof his criminal proceeding would have been different had he not\npleaded guilty. Petitioner does not dispute that he possessed large\nquantities of illegal drugs or that the Government had secured a\nwitness who had purchased the drugs directly from him. In light of\nthis \u201coverwhelming evidence of .\u00a0.\u00a0. guilt,\u201d 2014 WL\n1260388, *15 (WD Tenn., Mar. 20, 2014), the Court of Appeals\nconcluded that petitioner had \u201cnobona fidedefense, not\neven a weak one,\u201d 825 F.\u00a03d 311, 316 (CA6 2016). His only\nchance of succeeding would have been to \u201cthro[w] a \u2018Hail Mary\u2019 at\ntrial.\u201dAnte,at 8. As I have explained, however, the Court\ninStricklandexpressly foreclosed relying on the\npossibility of a \u201cHail Mary\u201d to establish prejudice. Seesupra,at 3.Stricklandmade clear that the prejudice\nassessment should \u201cproceed on the assumption that the decisionmaker\nis reasonably, conscientiously, and impartially applying the\nstandards that govern the decision.\u201d 466 U.\u00a0S., at 695.In the face of overwhelming evidence of guilt\nand in the absence of a bona fide defense, a reasonable court or\njury applying the law to the facts of this case would find the\ndefendant guilty. There is no reasonable probability of any other\nverdict. A defendant in petitioner\u2019s shoes, therefore, would have\nsuffered the same deportation consequences regardless of whether he\naccepted a plea or went to trial. He is thus plainly better off for\nhaving accepted his plea: had he gone to trial, he not only would\nhave faced the same deportation consequences, he also likely would\nhave received a higher prison sentence. Finding that petitioner has\nestablished prejudice in these circumstances turnsStricklandon its head.IVThe Court\u2019s decision today will have\npernicious consequences for the criminal justice system. This Court\nhas shown special solicitude for the plea process, which brings\n\u201cstability\u201d and \u201ccertainty\u201d to \u201cthe criminal justice system.\u201dPremo, 562 U.\u00a0S., at 132. The Court has warned that\n\u201cthe prospect of collateral challenges\u201d threatens to undermine\nthese important values.Ibid.And we have explained that\n\u201c[p]rosecutors must have assurance that a plea will not be undone\nyears later,\u201d lest they \u201cforgo plea bargains that would benefit\ndefendants,\u201d which would be \u201ca result favorable to no one.\u201dId.,at 125.The Court today provides no assurance that plea\ndeals negotiated in good faith with guilty defendants will remain\nfinal. For one thing, the Court\u2019s artificially cabined standard for\nprejudice in the plea context is likely to generate a high volume\nof challenges to existing and future plea agreements. Under the\nmajority\u2019s standard, defendants bringing these challenges will bear\na relatively low burden to show prejudice. Whereas a defendant\nasserting an ordinary claim of ineffective assistance of counsel\nmust prove that the ultimate outcome of his case would have been\ndifferent, the Court today holds that a defendant who pleaded\nguilty need show only that he would have rejected his plea and gone\nto trial. This standard does not appear to be particularly\ndemanding, as even a defendant who has only the \u201csmallest chance of\nsuccess at trial\u201d\u2014relying on nothing more than a \u201c\u00a0\u2018Hail\nMary\u2019\u00a0\u201d\u2014may be able to satisfy it.Ante,at 7, 8. For\nanother, the Court does not limit its holding to immigration\nconsequences. Under its rule, so long as a defendant alleges that\nhis counsel omitted or misadvised him on a piece of information\nduring the plea process that he considered of \u201cparamount\nimportance,\u201dante,at 10, he could allege a plausible claim\nof ineffective assistance of counsel.In addition to undermining finality, the Court\u2019s\nrule will impose significant costs on courts and prosecutors. Under\nthe Court\u2019s standard, a challenge to a guilty plea will be a highly\nfact-intensive, defendant-specific undertaking. Petitioner suggests\nthat each claim will \u201cat least\u201d require a \u201chearing to get th[e]\nfacts on the table.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 7. Given that more than 90\npercent of criminal convictions are the result of guilty pleas,Frye, 566 U.\u00a0S., at 143, the burden of holding\nevidentiary hearings on these claims could be significant. In\ncircumstances where a defendant has admitted his guilt, the\nevidence against him is overwhelming, and he has no bona fide\ndefense strategy, I see no justification for imposing these\ncosts.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*For these reasons, I would affirm the judgment\nof the Court of Appeals. I respectfully dissent.Notes1*\u00a0It is not enough for a\ndefendant to show that he would have obtained a better plea\nagreement. \u201c[A] defendant has no right to be offered a plea,\u201dMissouriv.Frye, 566 U.\u00a0S. 134, 148 (2012) ;Laflerv.Cooper, 566 U.\u00a0S. 156, 168 (2012) ,\nand this Court has never concluded that a defendant could show a\n\u201creasonable probability\u201d of a different result based on a purely\nhypothetical plea offer subject to absolute executive\ndiscretion.",
