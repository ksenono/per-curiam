    "text": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES_________________Nos. 19\u2013431 and 19\u2013454_________________LITTLE SISTERS OF THE POOR SAINTS PETER\nAND PAUL HOME, PETITIONER19\u2013431v.PENNSYLVANIA, et al.DONALD J. TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED\nSTATES, et al., PETITIONERS19\u2013454v.PENNSYLVANIA, et al.on writs of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the third circuit[July 8, 2020]Justice Kagan, with whom Justice Breyer joins,\nconcurring in the judgment.I would uphold HRSA\u2019s statutory authority to\nexempt certain employers from the contraceptive-coverage mandate,\nbut for different reasons than the Court gives. I also write\nseparately because I question whether the exemptions can survive\nadministrative law\u2019s demand for reasoned decisionmaking. That issue\nremains open for the lower courts to address.The majority and dissent dispute the breadth of\nthe delegation in the Women\u2019s Health Amendment to the ACA. The\nAmendment states that a health plan or insurer must offer coverage\nfor \u201cpreventive care and screenings .\u00a0.\u00a0. as provided for\nin comprehensive guidelines supported by [HRSA] for purposes of\nthis paragraph.\u201d 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7300gg\u201313(a)(4). The\ndisputed question is just what HRSA can \u201cprovide for.\u201d Both the\nmajority and the dissent agree that HRSA\u2019s guidelines can\ndifferentiate among preventive services, mandating coverage of some\nbut not others. The opinions disagree about whether those\nguidelines can also differentiate among health plans, exempting\nsome but not others from the contraceptive-coverage requirement. On\nthat question, all the two opinions have in common is equal\ncertainty they are right. Compareante,at 16 (majority\nopinion) (Congress \u201cenacted expansive language offer[ing] no\nindication whatever that the statute limits what HRSA can designate\nas preventive care and screenings or who must provide that\ncoverage\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)), withpost,at\n9 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting) (\u201cNothing in [the statute] accord[s]\nHRSA authority\u201d to decide \u201cwhomust provide coverage\u201d\n(internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis in original)).Try as I might, I do not find that kind of\nclarity in the statute. Sometimes when I squint, I read the law as\ngiving HRSA discretion over all coverage issues: The agency gets to\ndecide who needs to provide what services to women. At other times,\nI see the statute as putting the agency in charge of only the\n\u201cwhat\u201d question, and not the \u201cwho.\u201d If I had to, I would of course\ndecide which is the marginally better reading. ButChevrondeference was built for cases like these. SeeChevron\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0A. Inc.v.Natural Resources Defense\nCouncil, Inc.,467 U.S.\n837, 842\u2013843 (1984); see alsoArlingtonv.FCC,569 U.S.\n290, 301 (2013) (holding thatChevronapplies to\nquestions about the scope of an agency\u2019s statutory authority).Chevroninstructs that a court facing statutory ambiguity\nshould accede to a reasonable interpretation by the implementing\nagency. The court should do so because the agency is the more\npolitically accountable actor. See 467 U.\u00a0S., at 865\u2013866. And\nit should do so because the agency\u2019s expertise often enables a\nsounder assessment of which reading best fits the statutory scheme.\nSeeid.,at 865.Here, the Departments have adopted the\nmajority\u2019s reading of the statutory delegation ever since its\nenactment. Over the course of two administrations, the Departments\nhave shifted positions on many questions involving the Women\u2019s\nHealth Amendment and the ACA more broadly. But not on whether the\nAmendment gives HRSA the ability to create exemptions to the\ncontraceptive-coverage mandate. HRSA adopted the original church\nexemption on the same capacious understanding of its statutory\nauthority as the Departments endorse today. See 76 Fed. Reg. 46623\n(2011) (\u201cIn the Departments\u2019 view, it is appropriate that HRSA, in\nissuing these Guidelines, takes into account the effect on the\nreligious beliefs of certain religious employers if coverage of\ncontraceptive services were required\u201d).[1] While the exemption itself has expanded, the\nDepartments\u2019 reading of the statutory delegation\u2014that the law gives\nHRSA discretion over the \u201cwho\u201d question\u2014has remained the same. I\nwould defer to that longstanding and reasonable interpretation.But that does not mean the Departments should\nprevail when these cases return to the lower courts. The States\nchallenged the exemptions not only as outside HRSA\u2019s statutory\nauthority, but also as \u201carbitrary [and] capricious.\u201d 5\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7706(2)(A). Because the courts below found for\nthe States on the first question, they declined to reach the\nsecond. That issue is now ready for resolution, unaffected by\ntoday\u2019s decision. An agency acting within its sphere of delegated\nauthority can of course flunk the test of \u201creasoned\ndecisionmaking.\u201dMichiganv.EPA, 576 U.S. 743, 750\n(2015). The agency does so when it has not given \u201ca satisfactory\nexplanation for its action\u201d\u2014when it has failed to draw a \u201crational\nconnection\u201d between the problem it has identified and the solution\nit has chosen, or when its thought process reveals \u201ca clear error\nof judgment.\u201dMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United States,\nInc.v.State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co.,463 U.S.\n29, 43 (1983) (internal quotation marks omitted). Assessed\nagainst that standard of reasonableness, the exemptions HRSA and\nthe Departments issued give every appearance of coming up\nshort.[2]Most striking is a mismatch between the scope of\nthe religious exemption and the problem the agencies set out to\naddress. In the Departments\u2019 view, the exemption was \u201cnecessary to\nexpand the protections\u201d for \u201ccertain entities and individuals\u201d with\n\u201creligious objections\u201d to contraception. 83 Fed. Reg. 57537 (2018).\nRecall that under the old system, an employer objecting to the\ncontraceptive mandate for religious reasons could avail itself of\nthe \u201cself-certification accommodation.\u201dAnte,at 6. Upon\nmaking the certification, the employer no longer had \u201cto contract,\narrange, [or] pay\u201d for contraceptive coverage; instead, its insurer\nwould bear the services\u2019 cost. 78 Fed. Reg. 39874 (2013). That\ndevice dispelled some employers\u2019 objections\u2014but not all. The Little\nSisters, among others, maintained that the accommodation itself\nmade them complicit in providing contraception. The measure thus\nfailed to \u201cassuage[\u00a0]\u201d their \u201csincere religious objections.\u201d\n82 Fed. Reg. 47799 (2017). Given that fact, the Departments might\nhave chosen to exempt the Little Sisters and other still-objecting\ngroups from the mandate. But the Departments went further still.\nTheir rule exempted all employers with objections to the mandate,\neven if the accommodation met their religious needs. In other\nwords, the Departments exempted employers who had no religious\nobjection to the status quo (because they did not share the Little\nSisters\u2019 views about complicity). The rule thus went beyond what\nthe Departments\u2019 justification supported\u2014raising doubts about\nwhether the solution lacks a \u201crational connection\u201d to the problem\ndescribed.State Farm, 463 U.\u00a0S., at 43.[3]And the rule\u2019s overbreadth causes serious harm,\nby the Departments\u2019 own lights. In issuing the rule, the\nDepartments chose to retain the contraceptive mandate itself. See\n83 Fed. Reg. 57537. Rather than dispute HRSA\u2019s prior finding that\nthe mandate is \u201cnecessary for women\u2019s health and well-being,\u201d the\nDepartments left that determination in place. HRSA, Women\u2019s\nPreventive Services Guidelines (Dec. 2019),\nwww.hrsa.gov/womens-guidelines-2019; see 83 Fed. Reg. 57537. The\nDepartments thus committed themselves to minimizing the impact on\ncontraceptive coverage, even as they sought to protect employers\nwith continuing religious objections. But they failed to fulfill\nthat commitment to women. Remember that the accommodation preserves\nemployees\u2019 access to cost-free contraceptive coverage, while the\nexemption does not. Seeante,at 5\u20136. So the Departments\n(again, according to their own priorities) should have exempted\nonly employers who had religious objections to the\naccommodation\u2014not those who viewed it as a religiously acceptable\ndevice for complying with the mandate. The Departments\u2019 contrary\ndecision to extend the exemption to those without any religious\nneed for it yielded all costs and no benefits. Once again, that\noutcome is hard to see as consistent with reasoned judgment. SeeState Farm, 463 U.\u00a0S., at 43.[4]Other aspects of the Departments\u2019 handiwork may\nalso prove arbitrary and capricious. For example, the Departments\nallow even publicly traded corporations to claim a religious\nexemption. See 83 Fed. Reg. 57562\u201357563. That option is unusual\nenough to raise a serious question about whether the Departments\nadequately supported their choice. Cf.Burwellv.Hobby\nLobby Stores, Inc.,573 U.S.\n682, 717 (2014) (noting the oddity of \u201ca publicly traded\ncorporation asserting RFRA rights\u201d). Similarly, the Departments\noffer an exemption to employers who have moral, rather than\nreligious, objections to the contraceptive mandate. Perhaps there\nare sufficient reasons for that decision\u2014for example, a desire to\nstay neutral between religion and non-religion. See 83 Fed. Reg.\n57603\u201357604. But RFRA cast a long shadow over the Departments\u2019\nrulemaking, seeante,at 19\u201322, and that statute does not\napply to those with only moral scruples. So a careful agency would\nhave weighed anew, in this different context, the benefits of\nexempting more employers from the mandate against the harms of\ndepriving more women of contraceptive coverage. In the absence of\nsuch a reassessment, it seems a close call whether the moral\nexemption can survive.None of this is to say that the Departments\ncould not issue a valid rule expanding exemptions from the\ncontraceptive mandate. As noted earlier, I would defer to the\nDepartments\u2019 view of the scope of Congress\u2019s delegation. Seesupra,at 3. That means the Departments (assuming they act\nhand-in-hand with HRSA) have wide latitude over exemptions, so long\nas they satisfy the requirements of reasoned decisionmaking. But\nthat \u201cso long as\u201d is hardly nothing. Even in an area of broad\nstatutory authority\u2014maybe especially there\u2014agencies must rationally\naccount for their judgments.Notes1The First Amendment\ncannot have separately justified the church exemption, as the\ndissent suggests. Seepost, at 12\u201313 (opinion of Ginsburg,\nJ.). That exemption enables a religious institution to decline to\nprovide contraceptive coverage toallits employees, from a\nminister to a building custodian. By contrast, the so-called\nministerial exception of the First Amendment (which the dissent\ncites, seepost, at 13) extends only toselectemployees, having ministerial status. SeeOur Lady of Guadalupe\nSchoolv.Morrissey-Berru, 591 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___\n(2020) (slip op., at 14\u201316);Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran\nChurch and Schoolv.EEOC,565 U.S.\n171, 190 (2012). (Too, this Court has applied the ministerial\nexception only to protect religious institutions from employment\ndiscrimination suits, expressly reserving whether the exception\nexcuses their non-compliance with other laws. Seeid., at\n196.) And there is no general constitutional immunity, over and\nabove the ministerial exception, that can protect a religious\ninstitution from the law\u2019s operation.2I speak here only of the\nsubstantive validity of the exemptions. I agree with the Court that\nthe final rules issuing the exemptions were procedurally\nvalid.3At oral argument, the\nSolicitor General argued that the rule\u2019s overinclusion is harmless\nbecause the accommodation remains available to all employers who\nqualify for the exemption. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 20\u201323. But in their\nfinal rule, the Departments themselves acknowledged the prospect\nthat some employers without a religious objection to the\naccommodation would switch to the exemption. See 83 Fed. Reg.\n57576\u201357577 (\u201cOf course, some of the[\u00a0] religious\u201d\ninstitutions that \u201cdo not conscientiously oppose participating\u201d in\nthe accommodation \u201cmay opt for the expanded exemption[,] but others\nmight not\u201d);id.,at 57561 (\u201c[I]t is not clear to the\nDepartments\u201d how many of the religious employers who had used the\naccommodation without objection \u201cwill choose to use the expanded\nexemption instead\u201d). And the Solicitor General, when pressed at\nargument, could offer no evidence that, since the rule took effect,\nemployers without the Little Sisters\u2019 complicity beliefs had\ndeclined to avail themselves of the new exemption. Tr. of Oral Arg.\n22.4In a brief passage in the\ninterim final rule, the Departments suggested that an exemption is\n\u201cmore workable\u201d than the accommodation in addressing religious\nobjections to the mandate. 82 Fed. Reg. 47806. But the Departments\ncontinue to provide the accommodation to any religious employers\nwho request that option, thus maintaining a two-track system. Seeante,at 10; n.\u00a03,supra. So ease of\nadministration cannot support, at least without more explanation,\nthe Departments\u2019 decision to offer the exemption more broadly than\nneeded.",
