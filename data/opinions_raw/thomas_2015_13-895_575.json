These consolidated cases are yet\nanother installment in the \u201cdisastrous misadventure\u201d of this\nCourt\u2019s voting rights jurisprudence.Id.,at 893. We have\nsomehow arrived at a place where the parties agree that Alabama\u2019s\nlegislative districts should be fine-tuned to achieve some\n\u201coptimal\u201d result with respect to black voting power; the only\ndis-agreement is about whatpercentageof blacks should be\nplaced in those optimized districts. This is nothing more than a\nfight over the \u201cbest\u201d racial quota.I join Justice Scalia\u2019s dissent. I write only to point out that,\nas this case painfully illustrates, our jurisprudence in this area\ncontinues to be infected with error.IThe Alabama Legislature faced a difficult situation in its 2010\nredistricting efforts. It began with racially segregated district\nmaps that were inherited from previous decades. The maps produced\nby the 2001 redistricting contained 27 majority-black House\ndistricts and 8 majority-black Senate districts\u2014both at the time\nthey weredrawn, App. to Juris. Statement 47\u201348, and at the time of\nthe 2010 Census, App. 103\u2013108. Many of these majority-black\ndistricts were over 70% black when they were drawn in 2001, and\neven more were over 60% black. App. to Juris. Statement 47\u201348. Even\nafter the 2010 Census, the population remained above 60% black in\nthe majority of districts. App. 103\u2013108.Under the 2006 amendments to \u00a75 of the Voting Rights Act of\n1965, Alabama was also under a federal command to avoid drawing new\ndistricts that would \u201chave the effect of diminishing the ability\u201d\nof black voters \u201cto elect their preferred candidates of choice.\u201d52\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a710304(b). To comply with \u00a75, the legislature\nadopted a policy of maintaining the same percentage of black voters\nwithin each of those districts as existed in the 2001 plans. Seeante,at 16. This, the districting committee thought, would\npreserve the ability of black voters to elect the same number of\npreferred candidates. App. to Juris. Statement 174\u2013175. The\nDepartment of Justice (DOJ) apparently agreed. Acting under its\nauthority to administer \u00a75 of the Voting Rights Act, the DOJ\nprecleared Alabama\u2019s plans.[1]Id.,at\n9.Appellants\u2014including the Alabama Legislative Black Caucus and\nthe Alabama Democratic Conference\u2014saw matters differently. They\nsued Alabama, and on appeal they argue that the State\u2019s\nredistricting plans are racially gerrymandered because many\ndistricts are highly packed with black voters. According to\nappellants, black voters would have more voting power if they were\nspread over more districts rather than concentrated in the same\nnumber of districts as in previous decades. The DOJ has entered the\nfray in support of appellants, arguing that the State\u2019s\nredistricting maps fail strict scrutiny because the State focused\ntoo heavily on a single racial characteristic\u2014the number of black\nvoters in majority-minority districts\u2014which potentially resulted in\nimpermissible packing of black voters.Like the DOJ, today\u2019s majority sides with appellants, faulting\nAlabama for choosing the wrong percentage of blacks in the State\u2019s\nmajority-black districts, or at least for arriving at that\npercentage using the wrong reasoning. In doing so, the Court\u2014along\nwith appellants and the DOJ\u2014exacerbates a problem many years in the\nmaking. It seems fitting, then, to trace that history here. The\npractice of creating highly packed\u2014\u201csafe\u201d\u2014majority-minority\ndistricts is the product of our erroneous jurisprudence, which\ncreated a system that forces States to segregate voters into\ndistricts based on the color of their skin. Alabama\u2019s current\nlegislative districts have their genesis in the \u201cmax-black\u201d policy\nthat the DOJ itself applied to \u00a75 throughout the 1990\u2019s and early\n2000\u2019s. The 2006 amendments to \u00a75 then effectively locked in place\nAlabama\u2019s max-black districts that were established during the\n1990\u2019s and 2000\u2019s. These three problems\u2014a jurisprudence requiring\nsegregated districts, the distortion created by the DOJ\u2019s max-black\npolicy, and the ossifying effects of the 2006 amendments\u2014are the\nprimary culprits in this case, not Alabama\u2019s redistricting policy.\nNor does this Court have clean hands.IIThis Court created the current system of race-based\nredistricting by adopting expansive readings of \u00a72 and \u00a75 of the\nVoting Rights Act. Both \u00a72 and \u00a75 prohibit States from implementing\nvoting laws that \u201cden[y] or abridg[e] the right to vote on account\nof race or color.\u201d \u00a7\u00a710304(a), 10301(a). But both provisions extend\nto only certain types of voting laws: any \u201cvoting qualification or\nprerequisite to voting, or standard, practice, or procedure.\u201dIbid.As I have previously explained, the terms\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018standard, practice, or procedure\u2019 .\u00a0.\u00a0. refer\nonly to practices that affect minor-ity citizens\u2019 access to the\nballot,\u201d such as literacy tests.Holder, 512 U.\u00a0S. at\n914 (opinion concurring in judgment). They do not apply to\n\u201c[d]istricting systems and electoral mechanisms that may affect the\n\u2018weight\u2019 given to a ballot duly cast and counted.\u201dIbid.Yet\nthis Court has adopted far-reaching interpretations of both\nprovisions, holding that they encompass legislative redistricting\nand other actions that might \u201cdilute\u201d the strength of minority\nvotes. See generallyThornburgv.Gingles,478\nU.\u00a0S. 30 (1986) (\u00a72 \u201cvote dilution\u201d challenge to legislative\ndistricting plan); see alsoAllenv.State Bd. of\nElections,393 U.\u00a0S. 544\u2013587 (1969) (Harlan, J., concurring\nin part and dissenting in part).The Court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a72 and \u00a75 have resulted in\nchallenge after challenge to the drawing of voting districts. See,e.g., Bartlettv.Strickland,556 U.\u00a0S. 1 (2009);League of United Latin American Citizensv.Perry,548\nU.\u00a0S. 399 (2006);Georgiav.Ashcroft,539\nU.\u00a0S. 461 (2003);Renov.Bossier Parish School\nBd.,528 U.\u00a0S. 320 (2000) (Bossier II);Huntv.Cromartie,526 U.\u00a0S. 541 (1999);Renov.Bossier Parish School Bd.,520 U.\u00a0S. 471\n(1997) (Bossier I);Bushv.Vera,517\nU.\u00a0S. 952 (1996);Shawv.Hunt,517 U.\u00a0S.\n899 (1996) (Shaw II);Millerv.Johnson,515 U.\u00a0S. 900 (1995);United Statesv.Hays,515 U.\u00a0S. 737 (1995);Holder,supra;Johnsonv.De Grandy,512 U.\u00a0S. 997 (1994);Growev.Emison,507 U.\u00a0S. 25 (1993);Shawv.Reno,509 U.\u00a0S. 630 (1993) (Shaw I);Voinovichv.Quilter,507 U.\u00a0S. 146 (1993).The consequences have been as predictable and as they are\nunfortunate. In pursuing \u201cundiluted\u201d or maximized minority voting\npower, \u201cwe have devised a remedial mechanism that encourages\nfederal courts to segregate voters into racially designated\ndistricts to ensure minority electoral success.\u201dHolder,supra,at 892 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment). Section\n5, the provision at issue here, has been applied to require States\nthat redistrict to maintain the number of pre-existing\nmajority-minority districts, in which minority voters make up a\nlarge enough portion of the population to be able to elect their\ncandidate of choice. See,e.g., Miller,supra, at\n923\u2013927 (rejecting the DOJ\u2019s policy of requiring States to increase\nthe number of majority-black districts because maintaining the same\nnumber of majority-black districts would not violate \u00a75).In order to maintain these \u201cracially \u2018safe burroughs,\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nStates or courts must perpetually \u201cdivid[e] the country into\nelectoral districts along racial lines\u2014an enterprise of segregating\nthe races into political homelands.\u201dHolder,supra,at 905 (opinion of Thomas, J.) (internal quotation marks omitted).\nThe assumptions underlying this practice of creating and\nmaintaining \u201csafe minority districts\u201d\u2014\u201cthat members of [a] racial\ngroup must think alike and that their interests are so distinct\nthat they must be provided a separate body of\nrepresentatives\u201d\u2014remain \u201crepugnant to any nation that strives for\nthe ideal of a color-blind Constitution.\u201dId.,at 905\u2013906.\nAnd, as predicted, the States\u2019 compliance efforts have \u201cembroil[ed]\nthe courts in a lengthy process of attempting to undo, or at least\nto minimize, the damage wrought by the system we created.\u201dId.,at 905.It is this fateful system that has\nproduced these cases.IIIAIn tandem with our flawed jurisprudence, the DOJ has played a\nsignificant role in creating Alabama\u2019s current redistricting\nproblem. It did so by enforcing \u00a75 in a manner that required\nStates, including Alabama, to create supermajority-black voting\ndistricts or face denial ofpre-clearance.The details of this so-called \u201cmax-black\u201d policy were\nhighlighted in federal court during Georgia\u2019s 1991 congressional\nredistricting. SeeJohnsonv.Miller, 864\nF.\u00a0Supp. 1354, 1360\u20131361 (SD Ga. 1994). On behalf of the Black\nCaucus of the Georgia General Assembly, the American Civil\nLiberties Union (ACLU) submitted a redistricting proposal to the\nGeorgia Legislature that became known as the \u201cmax-black plan.\u201dId.,at 1360. The ACLU\u2019s map created two new \u201cblack\u201d\ndistricts and \u201cfurther maximized black voting strength by pushing\nthe percentage of black voters within its majority-black districts\nas high as possible.\u201dId.,at 1361 (internal quotation marks\nomitted).The DOJ denied several of Georgia\u2019s proposals on the ground that\nthey did not include enough majority-black districts.Id.,\nat 1366. The plan it finally approved was substantially similar to\nthe ACLU\u2019s max-black proposal,id.,at 1364\u20131366, creating\nthree majority-black districts, with total black populations of\n56.63%, 62.27%, and 64.07%,id.,at 1366, and n.\n12.[2]Georgia was not the only State subject to the DOJ\u2019s maximization\npolicy. North Carolina, for example, submitted a congressional\nredistricting plan after the 1990 Census, but the DOJ rejected it\nbecause it did not create a new majority-minority district, and\nthus \u201cappear[ed] to minimize minority voting strength.\u201dShawv.Barr, 808 F.\u00a0Supp. 461, 463\u2013464 (EDNC 1992) (quoting\nLetter from John R. Dunne, Assistant Attorney General of\nN.\u00a0C., Civil Rights Div., to Tiare B. Smiley, Special Deputy\nAttorney General of N.\u00a0C. 4 (Dec. 18, 1991)). The DOJ likewise\npressured Louisiana to create a new majority-black district when\nthe State sought approval of its congressional redistricting plan\nfollowing the 1990 Census. SeeHaysv.Louisiana, 839\nF.\u00a0Supp. 1188, 1190 (WD La. 1993), va-cated on other grounds\nbyLouisianav.Hays,512 U.\u00a0S. 1230 (1994).Although we eventually rejected the DOJ\u2019s max-black policy, seeMiller,supra, at 924\u2013927, much damage to the States\u2019\ncongressional and legislative district maps had already been done.\nIn those States that had enacted districting plans in accordance\nwith the DOJ\u2019s max-black policy, the prohibition on retrogression\nunder \u00a75 meant that the legislatures were effectively required to\nmaintain those max-black plans during any subsequent redistricting.\nThat is what happened in Alabama.BAlabama\u2019s 2010 redistricting plans were modeled after\nmax-black-inspired plans that the State put in place in the 1990\u2019s\nunder the DOJ\u2019s max-black policy. See generallyKelleyv.Bennett, 96 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d 1301 (MD Ala. 2000), vacated on\nother grounds bySinkfieldv.Kelley,531 U.\u00a0S.\n28 (2000) (per curiam).Following the 1990 Census, the Alabama Legislature began\nredrawing its state legislative districts. After several proposals\nfailed in the legislature, a group of plaintiffs sued, and the\nState entered into a consent decree agreeing to use the\n\u201cReed-Buskey\u201d plan. 96 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d, at 1309. The primary\ndesigner of this plan was Dr. Joe Reed, the current chairman of\nappellant Alabama Democratic Conference. According to Dr. Reed, the\nprevious plan from the 1980\u2019s was not \u201cfair\u201d because it did not\nachieve the number of \u201cblack-preferred\u201d representatives that was\nproportionate to the percentage of blacks in the population.Id.,at 1310. And because of the DOJ\u2019s max-black policy, \u201cit\nwas widely assumed that a state could (and, according to DOJ, had\nto) draw district lines with the primary intent of maximizing\nelection of black officials.\u201dId., at 1310, n.\u00a014. \u201cDr.\nReed thus set out to maximize the number of black representatives\nand senators elected to the legislature by maximizing the number of\nblack-majority districts.\u201dId.,at 1310.Illustrating\nthis strategy, Alabama\u2019s letter to the DOJ seeking preclearance of\nthe Reed-Buskey plan \u201cemphasize[d] the Plan\u2019s deliberate creation\nof enough majority-black districts to assure nearly proportional\nrepresentation in the legislature,\u201dibid., n.\u00a014 and\nboasted that the plan had created four new majority-black districts\nand two additional majority-black Senate districts.Ibid.Dr. Reed populated these districts with a percentage of black\nresidents that achieved an optimal middle ground\u2014a \u201chappy\nmedium\u201d\u2014between too many and too few.Id.,at 1311.\nTwenty-three of the twenty-seven majority-black House districts\nwere between 60% and 70% black under Reed\u2019s plan,id.,at\n1311, and Senate District 26\u2014one of the districts at issue\ntoday\u2014was pushed from 65% to 70% black.Id.,at\n1315.[3] A District Court struck down several\ndistricts created in the Reed-Buskey plan as unconstitutionally\nbased on race.Id.,at 1324. This Court reversed, however,\nholding that the plaintiffs lacked standing because they did not\nlive in the gerrymandered districts.Sinkfield,supra,at 30\u201331.The Reed-Buskey plan thus went into effect and provided the\ntemplate for the State\u2019s next redistricting efforts in 2001. SeeMontielv.Davis, 215 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d 1279, 1282 (SD\nAla. 2002). The 2001 maps maintained the same number of\nmajority-black districts as the Reed-Buskey plan had created: 27\nHouse districts and 8 Senate districts.Ibid. And \u201cto\nmaintain the same relative percentages of black voters in those\ndistricts,\u201d the legislature \u201credrew the districts by shifting more\nblack voters into the majority-black districts.\u201d App. to Juris.\nStatement 4. The State\u2019s letters requesting preclearance of the\n2001 plans boasted that the maps maintained the same number of\nmajority-black districts and the same (or higher) percentages of\nblack voters within those districts, other than \u201cslight reductions\u201d\nthat were \u201cnecessary to satisfy other legitimate, nondiscriminatory\nredistricting considerations.\u201d Letter from William H. Pryor,\nAlabama Attorney General, to Voting Section Chief, Civil Rights\nDivision, Department of Justice 6\u20137 (Aug. 14, 2001) (Senate\ndistricts); Letter from William H. Pryor, Alabama Attorney General,\nto Voting Section Chief, Civil Rights Division, Department of\nJustice 7, 9 (Sept. 4, 2001) (Housedistricts).Section 5 tied the State to those districts: Under this Court\u2019s\n\u00a75 precedents, States are prohibited from enacting a redistricting\nplan that \u201cwould lead to a retrogression in the position of racial\nminorities.\u201dBeerv.United States,425 U.\u00a0S.\n130,141 (1976). In other words, the State could not retrogress from\nthe previous plan if it wished to comply with \u00a75.IVAlabama\u2019s quandary as it attempted to redraw its legislative\ndistricts after 2010 was exacerbated by the 2006 amendments to \u00a75.\nThose amendments created an inflexible definition of\n\u201cretrogression\u201d that Alabama understandably took as requiring it to\nmaintain the same percentages of minority voters in\nmajority-minority districts. The amendments thus provide the last\npiece of the puzzle that explains why the State sought to maintain\nthe same percentages of blacks in each majority-black district.Congress passed the 2006 amendments in response to our attempt\nto define \u201cretrogression\u201d inGeorgiav.Ashcroft,539\nU.\u00a0S. 461. Prior to that decision, practically any\nreapportionment change could \u201cbe deemed \u2018retrogressive\u2019 under our\nvote dilution jurisprudence by a court inclined to find it so.\u201dBossier I, 520 U.\u00a0S., at 490\u2013491 (Thomas, J.,\nconcurring). \u201c[A] court could strike downanyreapportionment plan, either because it did not include enough\nmajority-minority districts or because it did (and thereby diluted\nthe minority vote in the remaining districts).\u201dId.,at\n491.Our \u00a75 jurisprudence thus \u201cinevitably force[d] the\ncourts to make political judgments regarding which type of\napportionment best serves supposed minority interests\u2014judgments\ncourts are ill equipped to make.\u201dId.,at 492.We tried to pull the courts and the DOJ away from making these\nsorts of judgments inGeorgiav.Ashcroft,supra. Insofar as \u00a75 applies to the drawing of voting\ndistricts, we held that a District Court had wrongly re-jected\nGeorgia\u2019s reapportionment plan, and we adopted a retrogression\nstandard that gave States flexibility in determining the percentage\nof black voters in each district.Id.,at 479\u2013481. As we\nexplained, \u201ca State may choose to create a certain number of \u2018safe\u2019\ndistricts, in which it is highly likely that minority voters will\nbe able to elect the candidate of their choice.\u201dId.,at\n480. Alternatively, \u201ca State may choose to create a greater number\nof districts in which it is likely\u2014although perhaps not quite as\nlikely as under the benchmark plan\u2014that minority voters will be\nable to elect candidates of their choice.\u201dIbid.We noted\nthat \u201cspreading out minority voters over a greater number of\ndistricts creates more districts in which minority voters may have\nthe opportunity to elect a candidate of their choice,\u201d even if\nsuccess is not guaranteed, and even if it diminished the chance of\nelecting a representative in some districts.Id.,at 481.\nThus, States would be permitted to make judgments about how best to\nprevent retrogression in a minority group\u2019s voting power, including\nassessing the range of appropriate minority population percentages\nwithin each district.Id.,at 480\u2013481.In response, Congress amended \u00a75 and effectively overruledGeorgiav.Ashcroft. See120Stat.577. The 2006\namendments added subsection (b), which provides:\u201cAny voting qualification or prerequisite to voting, or\nstandard, practice or procedure with respect to voting that has the\npurpose or will have the effect of diminishing the ability of any\ncitizens of the United States on account of race or color\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. to elect their preferred candidates of choice\ndenies or abridges the right to vote within the meaning of\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. this section.\u201d52 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a710304(b). See\n\u00a75,120Stat.577.Thus, any change that has the effect of \u201cdiminishing the\nability\u201d of a minority group to \u201celect their preferred candidate of\nchoice\u201d is retrogressive.Some were rightly worried that the 2006 amendments would impose\ntoo much inflexibility on the States as they sought to comply with\n\u00a75. Richard Pildes, who argued on behalf of the Alabama Democratic\nConference in these cases, testified in congressional hearings on\nthe 2006 amendments. He explained thatGeorgiav.Ashcroft\u201crecognizes room .\u00a0.\u00a0. for some modest\nflexibility in Section 5,\u201d and warned that if \u201cCongress overturnsGeorgiav.Ashcroft, it will make even this limited\namount of flexibility illegal.\u201d Hearing on the Continuing Need for\nSection 5 Pre-Clearance before the Senate Committee on the\nJudiciary, 109th Congress, 2d Sess., pp. 11\u201312 (2006). Pildes also\nobserved that the proposed standard of \u201cno \u2018diminished ability to\nelect\u2019 .\u00a0.\u00a0. has a rigidity and a mechanical quality that\ncan lock into place minority districts in the south at populations\nthat do not serve minority voters\u2019 interests.\u201dId.,at 12.\nAlthough this testimony saysnothing about how \u00a75 ought to be\ninterpreted, it tells us that the Alabama Democratic Conference\u2019s\nown attorney believes that the State was subject to a \u201crigi[d]\u201d\nand\u201cmechanical\u201d standard in determining the number ofblack voters\nthat must be maintained in a majority-black district.VAll of this history explains Alabama\u2019s circumstances when it\nattempted to redistrict after the 2010 Census. The legislature\nbegan with the max-black district maps that it inherited from the\ndays of Reed-Buskey. Using these inherited maps, combined with\npopulation data from the 2010 Census, many of the State\u2019s\nmajority-black House and Senate districts were between 60% and 70%\nblack, and some were over 70%. App. to Juris. Statement 103\u2013108.\nAnd the State was prohibited from drawing new districts that would\n\u201chave the effect of diminishing the ability\u201d of blacks \u201cto elect\ntheir preferred candidates of choice.\u201d \u00a710304(b). The legislature\nthus adopted a policy of maintaining the same number of\nmajority-black districts and roughly the same percentage of blacks\nwithin each of those districts. Seeante,at 16.The majority faults the State for taking this approach. I do not\npretend that Alabama is blameless when it comes to its sordid\nhistory of racial politics. But, today the State is not the one\nthat is culpable. Its redistricting effort was indeed tainted, but\nit was tainted by our voting rights jurisprudence and the uses to\nwhich the Voting Rights Act has been put. Long ago, the DOJ and\nspecial-interest groups like the ACLU hijacked the Act, and they\nhave been using it ever since to achieve their vision of maximized\nblack electoral strength, often at the expense of the voters they\npurport to help. States covered by \u00a75 have been whipsawed, first\nrequired to create \u201csafe\u201d majority-black districts, then told not\nto \u201cdiminis[h]\u201d the ability to elect, and now told they have been\ntoo rigid in preventing any \u201cdiminishing\u201d of the ability to elect.Ante,at 17\u201318.Worse, the majority\u2019s solution to the appellants\u2019 gerrymandering\nclaims requires States to analyze race evenmoreexhaustively, not less, by accounting for black voter registration\nand turnout statistics.Ante,at 18\u201319. The majority\u2019s\ncommand to analyze black voting patterns en route to adopting the\n\u201ccorrect\u201d racial quota does nothing to ease the conflict between\nour color-blind Constitution and the \u201cconsciously segregated\ndistricting system\u201d the Court has required in the name of equality.Holder, 512 U.\u00a0S., at 907. Although I dissent today on\nprocedural grounds, I also continue to disagree with the Court\u2019s\nmisguided and damaging jurisprudence.Notes1As I have previously explained, \u00a75 of\nthe Voting Rights Act is unconstitutional. SeeShelby Countyv.Holder, 570 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2013) (Thomas, J.,\nconcurring) (slip op., at 1). And \u00a75 no longer applies to Alabama\nafter the Court\u2019s decision inShelby County. Seeid.,at ___ (slip op., at 24) (majority opinion). Because the\nappellants\u2019 claims are not properly before us, however, I express\nno opinion on whether compliance with \u00a75 was a compelling\ngovernmental purpose at the time of Alabama\u2019s 2012 redistricting,\nnor do I suggest that Alabama would necessarily prevail if\nappellants had properly raised district-specific\nclaims.2The District Court found it \u201cunclear\nwhether DOJ\u2019s maximization policy was driven more by [the ACLU\u2019s]\nadvocacy or DOJ\u2019s own misguided reading of the Voting Rights Act,\u201d\nand it concluded that the \u201cconsiderable influence of ACLU advocacy\non the voting rights decisions of the United States Attorney\nGeneral is an embarrassment.\u201dJohnsonv.Miller,864\nF.\u00a0Supp. 1354, 1368 (SD Ga. 1994).3In this litigation, Dr. Reed and the\nAlabama Democratic Conference argue that the percentage of black\nresidents needed to maintain the ability to elect a black-preferred\ncandidate is lower than it was in the 2000\u2019s because black\nparticipation has increased over the last decade. Brief for\nAppellants in No. 13\u20131138, pp. 39\u201340. Although appellants disclaim\nany argument that the State must achieve an optimal percentage of\nblack voters in majority-black districts,id., at 35, it is\nclear that that is what they seek: a plan that maximizes voting\nstrength by maintaining \u201csafe\u201d majority-minority districts while\nalso spreading black voters into other districts where they can\ninfluence elections.Id., at 17\u201318.",
