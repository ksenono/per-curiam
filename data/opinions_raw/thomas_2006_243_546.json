GONZALES, ATTORNEY GENERAL, et\u00a0al.,\nPETITIONERSv.OREGON et\u00a0al.on writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the ninth circuit[January 17, 2006]Justice Thomas, dissenting.When Angel Raich and Diane Monson\nchallenged the application of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA),\n21 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7801et seq., to their purely intrastate\npossession of marijuana for medical use as authorized under\nCalifornia law, a majority of this Court (a mere seven months ago)\ndetermined that the CSA effectively invalidated California\u2019s law\nbecause \u201cthe CSA is a comprehensive regulatory regime specifically\ndesigned to regulate which controlled substances can be utilized\nfor medicinal purposes,and in what manner.\u201dGonzalesv.Raich,545 U. S. ___, ___ (2005)\n(slip op., at 24) (emphasis added). The majority employed\nunambiguous language, concluding that the \u201cmanner\u201d in which\ncontrolled substances can be utilized \u201cfor medicinal purposes\u201d is\none of the \u201ccore activities regulated by the CSA.\u201dId.,at\n___ (slip op., at 25). And, it described the CSA as \u201ccreating a\ncomprehensive framework for regulating the production,\ndistribution, and possession of \u2026 \u2018controlled substances,\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nincluding those substances that \u201c\u00a0\u2018have a useful and\nlegitimate medical purpose,\u2019\u00a0\u201d in order to \u201cfoster the\nbeneficial use of those medications\u201d and \u201cto prevent their misuse.\u201dId.,at ___ (slip op., at 21).Today the majority beats a hasty retreat from\nthese conclusions. Confronted with a regulation that broadly\nrequires all prescriptions to be issued for a \u201clegitimate medical\npurpose,\u201d 21 CFR \u00a71306.04(a) (2005), a regulation recognized inRaichas part of the Federal Government\u2019s \u201cclosed \u2026\nsystem\u201d for regulating the \u201cmanner\u201d in \u201cwhich controlled substances\ncan be utilized for medicinal purposes,\u201d 545 U. S., at ___, ___\n(slip op., at 10, 24), the majority rejects the Attorney General\u2019s\nadmittedly \u201cat least reasonable,\u201dante,at 26,\ndetermination that administering controlled substances to\nfacilitate a patient\u2019s death is not a \u201c\u00a0\u2018legitimate medical\npurpose.\u2019\u00a0\u201d The majority does so based on its conclusion that\nthe CSA is only concerned with the regulation of \u201cmedical practice\ninsofar as it bars doctors from using their prescription-writing\npowers as a means to engage in illicit drug dealing and trafficking\nas conventionally understood.\u201dAnte, at 23. In other\nwords, in stark contrast toRaich\u2019s broad conclusions\nabout the scope of the CSA as it pertains to the medicinal use of\ncontrolled substances, today this Court concludes that the CSA is\nmerely concerned with fighting \u201c\u00a0\u2018drug abuse\u2019\u00a0\u201d and only\ninsofar as that abuse leads to \u201caddiction or abnormal effects on\nthe nervous system.\u201d[Footnote\n1]Ante,at 26.The majority\u2019s newfound understanding of the\nCSA as a statute of limited reach is all the more puzzling because\nit rests upon constitutional principles that the majority of the\nCourt rejected inRaich. Notwithstanding the States\u2019\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018traditional police powers to define the criminal law and to\nprotect the health, safety, and welfare of their citizens,\u2019\u00a0\u201d\n545 U. S., at ___, n. 38 (slip op., at 27, n. 38), theRaichmajority concluded that the CSA applied to the\nintrastate possession of marijuana for medicinal purposes\nauthorized by California law because \u201cCongress could have\nrationally\u201d concluded that such an application was necessary to the\nregulation of the \u201clarger interstate marijuana market.\u201dId., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 28, 30). Here, by contrast,\nthe majority\u2019s restrictive interpretation of the CSA is based in no\nsmall part on \u201cthe structure and limitations of federalism, which\nallow the States \u2018\u00a0\u201cgreat latitude under their police powers\nto legislate as to the protection of the lives, limbs, health,\ncomfort, and quiet of all persons.\u201d\u00a0\u2019\u00a0\u201dAnte, at\n23 (quotingMedtronic, Inc.v.Lohr,518 U. S. 470, 475\n(1996), in turn quotingMetropolitan Life Ins. Co.v.Massachusetts,471 U. S. 724, 756\n(1985)). According to the majority, these \u201cbackground principles of\nour federal system \u2026 belie the notion that Congress would use \u2026 an\nobscure grant of authority to regulate areas traditionally\nsupervised by the States\u2019 police power.\u201dAnte,at 28.Of course there is nothing \u201cobscure\u201d about the\nCSA\u2019s grant of authority to the Attorney General.Ante,\np.\u00a0___ (Scalia, J., dissenting). And, the Attorney General\u2019s\nconclusion that the CSA prohibits the States from authorizing\nphysician assisted suicide is admittedly \u201cat least reasonable,\u201dante, at 26 (opinion of the Court), and is therefore\nentitled to deference.Ante,at 6\u20137 (Scalia, J.,\ndissenting). While the scope of the CSA and the Attorney General\u2019s\npower thereunder are sweeping, and perhaps troubling, such\nexpansive federal legislation and broad grants of authority to\nadministrative agencies are merely the inevitable and inexorable\nconsequence of this Court\u2019s Commerce Clause and\nseparation-of-powers jurisprudence. See,e.g.,Raich,supra;Whitmanv.American\nTrucking Assns., Inc.,531 U. S. 457(2001).I agree with limiting the applications of the\nCSA in a manner consistent with the principles of federalism and\nour constitutional structure.Raich,supra,at\n___ (Thomas, J., dissenting); cf.Whitman, supra, at\n486\u2013487 (Thomas, J., concurring) (noting constitutional concerns\nwith broad delegations of authority to administrative agencies).\nBut that is now water over the dam. The relevance of such\nconsiderations was at its zenith inRaich, when we\nconsidered whether the CSA could be applied to the intrastate\npossession of a controlled substance consistent with the limited\nfederal powers enumerated by the Constitution. Such considerations\nhave little, if any, relevance where, as here, we are merely\npresented with a question of statutory interpretation, and not the\nextent of constitutionally permissible federal power. This is\nparticularly true where, as here, we are interpreting broad,\nstraightforward language within a statutory framework that a\nmajority of this Court has concluded is so comprehensive that it\nnecessarily nullifies the States\u2019 \u201c\u00a0\u2018traditional \u2026 powers \u2026 to\nprotect the health, safety, and welfare of their\ncitizens.\u2019\u00a0\u201d[Footnote 2]Raich,supra,at ___, n. 38 (slip op., at 27, n.\n38). The Court\u2019s reliance upon the constitutional principles that\nit rejected inRaich\u2014albeit under the guise of statutory\ninterpretation\u2014is perplexing to say the least. Accordingly, I\nrespectfully dissent.Footnote 1The majority does not expressly address\nwhether the ingestion of a quantity of drugs that is sufficient to\ncause death has an \u201cabnormal effec[t] on the nervous system,\u201dante, at 25, though it implicitly rejects such a\nconclusion.Footnote 2Notably, respondents have not seriously\npressed a constitutional claim here, conceding at oral argument\nthat their \u201cpoint is not necessarily that [the CSA] would be\nunconstitutional.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 44. In any event, to the extent\nrespondents do present a constitutional claim, they do so solely\nwithin the framework ofRaich. Framed in this manner, the\nclaim must fail. The respondents inRaichwere \u201clocal\ngrowers and users of state-authorized, medical marijuana,\u201d who\nstood \u201coutside the interstate drug market\u201d and possessed\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018medicinal marijuana \u2026 not intended for \u2026 the stream of\ncommerce.\u2019\u00a0\u201d 545 U. S., at ___, ___, (slip op., at 5, 16)\n(Thomas, J., dissenting). Here, by contrast, the\nrespondent-physicians are active participants in the interstate\ncontrolled substances market, and the drugs they prescribe for\nassisting suicide have likely traveled in interstate commerce. If\nthe respondents inRaichcould not sustain a\nconstitutional claim, thena fortiorirespondents here\ncannot sustain one. Respondents\u2019 acceptance ofRaichforecloses their constitutional challenge.",
