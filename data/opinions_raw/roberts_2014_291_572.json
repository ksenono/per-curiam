    "text": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES_________________No. 12\u2013682_________________BILL SCHUETTE, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF MICHI-GAN,\nPETITIONER v. COALITION TO DEFEND AF-FIRMATIVE ACTION, INTEGRATION\nAND IMMI-GRANT RIGHTS AND FIGHT FOR EQUALITYBY ANY MEANS NECESSARY\n(BAMN), et al.on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the sixth circuit[April 22, 2014]Chief Justice\nRoberts, concurring.The dissent devotes 11\npages to expounding its own policy preferences in favor of taking\nrace into account in college admissions, while nonetheless\nconcluding that it \u201cdo[es] not mean to suggest that the\nvirtues of adopting race-sensitive admissions policies should\ninform the legal question before the Court.\u201d Post, at 57\n(opinion of Sotomayor, J.). The dissent concedes that the governing\nboards of the State\u2019s various universities could have\nimplemented a policy making it illegal to \u201cdiscriminate\nagainst, or grant preferential treatment to,\u201d any individ-ual\non the basis of race. See post, at 3, 34\u201335. On the\ndissent\u2019s view, if the governing boards conclude that drawing\nracial distinctions in university admissions is undesirable or\ncounterproductive, they are permissibly exercising their\npolicymaking authority. But others who might reach the same\nconclusion are failing to take race seriously.The dissent states that\n\u201c[t]he way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to\nspeak openly and candidly on the subject of race.\u201d Post, at\n46. And it urges that \u201c[r]ace matters because of the slights,\nthe snickers, the silent judgments that reinforce that most\ncrippling of thoughts: \u2018I do not belong\nhere.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Ibid. But it is not \u201cout of touch\nwith reality\u201d to conclude that racial preferences may\nthemselves have the debilitating effect of reinforcing precisely\nthat doubt, and\u2014if so\u2014that the preferences do more harm\nthan good. Post, at 45. To disagree with the dissent\u2019s views\non the costs and benefits of racial preferences is not to\n\u201cwish away, rather than confront\u201d racial inequality.\nPost, at 46. People can disagree in good faith on this issue, but\nit similarly does more harm than good to question the openness and\ncandor of those on either side of the debate.[1]*Notes1*\u00a0 and question the\nrelationship between v. , , and v. , . See at 6, n. 2 (, concurring\nin judgment); at 23, n.\u00a09 (, dissenting). The plurality today\naddresses that issue, explaining that the race-conscious action in\nwas unconstitutional given the absence of a showing of prior\nsegregation. , , at 720\u2013721 (majority opinion), 736\n(plurality opinion); see at 9. Today\u2019s plurality notes that\nthe Court in \u201cassumed\u201d the constitutionality of the\nbusing remedy at issue there, \u201c\u00a0\u2018even absent a\nfinding of prior segregation.\u2019\u00a0\u201d at 10 (quoting ,\n, at 472, n. 15). The assumption on which proceeded did not\nconstitute a finding sufficient to justify the race-conscious\naction in , though it is doubtless pertinent in analyzing .\n\u201cAs this Court held in , the [Seattle] school board\u2019s\npurported remedial action would not be permissible today absent a\nof segregation,\u201d but \u201cwe must understand as understood\nitself.\u201d at 9\u201310 (emphasis added).",
