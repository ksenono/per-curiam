First, did SLUSA strip state courts of jurisdiction\nover class actions alleging violations of only the Securities Act\nof 1933 (1933 Act), 48Stat. 74, as amended, 15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a777aet\u00a0seq.? And second, even if not, did SLUSA\nempower defendants to remove such actions from state to federal\ncourt? We answer both questions no.IAIn the wake of the 1929 stock market crash,\nCongress enacted two laws, in successive years, to promote honest\npractices in the securities markets. The 1933 Act required\ncompanies offering securities to the public to make \u201cfull and fair\ndisclosure\u201d of relevant information.Pinterv.Dahl,\n486 U.\u00a0S. 622, 646 (1988) . And to aid enforcement of those\nobligations, the statute created private rights of action. Congress\nauthorized both federal and state courts to exercise jurisdiction\nover those private suits. See \u00a722(a), 48Stat. 86 (\u201cThe district\ncourts of the United States .\u00a0.\u00a0. shall have\njurisdiction[,] concurrent with State and Territorial courts, of\nall suits in equity and actions at law brought to enforce any\nliability or duty created by this title\u201d). More unusually, Congress\nalso barred the removal of such actions from state to federal\ncourt.Id.,at 87 (\u201cNo case arising under this title and\nbrought in any State court of competent jurisdiction shall be\nremoved to any court of the United States\u201d). So if a plaintiff\nchose to bring a 1933 Act suit in state court, the defendant could\nnot change the forum.Congress\u2019s next foray, the Securities Exchange\nAct of 1934 (1934 Act), operated differently. See 48Stat. 881, as\namended, 15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a778aet\u00a0seq.That\nstatute regulated not the original issuance of securities but\ninstead all their subsequent trading, most commonly on national\nstock exchanges. SeeBlue Chip Stampsv.Manor Drug\nStores, 421 U.\u00a0S. 723, 752 (1975) . The 1934 Act, this\nCourt held, could also be enforced through private rights of\naction. Seeid.,at 730, and n.\u00a04. But Congress\ndetermined that all those suits should fall within the \u201cexclusive\njurisdiction\u201d of the federal courts. \u00a727, 48Stat. 902\u2013903. So a\nplaintiff could never go to state court to litigate a 1934 Act\nclaim.In 1995, the Private Securities Litigation\nReform Act (Reform Act), 109Stat. 737, amended both the 1933 and\nthe 1934 statutes in mostly identical ways. Congress passed the\nReform Act principally to stem \u201cperceived abuses of the\nclass-action vehicle in litigation involving nationally traded\nsecurities.\u201dMerrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Inc.v.Dabit, 547 U.\u00a0S. 71, 81 (2006) . Some of the Reform\nAct\u2019s provisions made substantive changes to the 1933 and 1934\nlaws, and applied even when a 1933 Act suit was brought in state\ncourt. For instance, the statute created a \u201csafe harbor\u201d from\nfederal liability for certain \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d made by\ncompany officials. 15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a777z\u20132 (1933 Act); \u00a778u\u20135\n(1934 Act). Other Reform Act provisions modified the procedures\nused in litigating securities actions, and applied only when such a\nsuit was brought in federal court. To take one example, the statute\nrequired a lead plaintiff in any class action brought under the\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure to file a sworn certification\nstating, among other things, that he had not purchased the relevant\nsecurity \u201cat the direction of plaintiff\u2019s counsel.\u201d\n\u00a777z\u20131(a)(2)(A)(ii) (1933 Act); \u00a778u\u20134(a)(2)(A)(ii) (1934 Act).But the Reform Act fell prey to the law of\n\u201cunintended consequence[s].\u201dDabit, 547 U.\u00a0S., at 82.\nAs this Court previously described the problem: \u201cRather than face\nthe obstacles set in their path by the Reform Act, plaintiffs and\ntheir representatives began bringing class actions under state\nlaw.\u201dIbid.That \u201cphenomenon was a novel one\u201d\u2014and an\nunwelcome one as well.Ibid.To prevent plaintiffs from\ncircumventing the Reform Act, Congress again undertook to modify\nboth securities laws.The result was SLUSA, whose amendments to the\n1933 Act are at issue in this case. Those amendments include, as\nrelevant here, two operative provisions, two associated\ndefinitions, and two \u201cconforming amendments\u201d to the 1933 law\u2019s\njurisdictional section. 112Stat. 3230. (SLUSA\u2019s amendments to the\n1934 Act include essentially the same operative provisions and\ndefinitions. SeeDabit, 547 U.\u00a0S., at 82, n.\u00a06.\nBut Congress decided that the 1934 law\u2019s exclusive jurisdiction\nprovision needed no conforming amendments.) The added material\u2014now\nfound in \u00a7\u00a777p and 77v(a) and set out in full in this opinion\u2019s\nappendix\u2014goes as follows.First, \u00a777p(b) altogether prohibits certain\nsecurities class actions based on state law. That provision\u2014which\nwe sometimes (and somewhat prosaically) refer to as the state-law\nclass-action bar\u2014reads:\u201cNo covered class action based upon the\nstatutory or common law of any State .\u00a0.\u00a0. may be\nmaintained in any State or Federal court by any private party\nalleging\u2014\u201c(1) an untrue statement or omission of a\nmaterial fact in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered\nsecurity; or\u201c(2) that the defendant used or employed any\nmanipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in connection with\nthe purchase or sale of a covered security.\u201dAccording to SLUSA\u2019s definitions, the term\n\u201ccovered class action\u201d means a class action in which \u201cdamages are\nsought on behalf of more than 50 persons.\u201d \u00a777p(f)(2). And the term\n\u201ccovered security\u201d refers to a security listed on a national stock\nexchange. \u00a777p(f)(3) (cross-referencing \u00a777r(b)). So taken all in\nall, \u00a777p(b) completely disallows (in both state and federal\ncourts) sizable class actions that are founded on state law and\nallege dishonest practices respecting a nationally traded\nsecurity\u2019s purchase or sale.Next, \u00a777p(c) provides for the removal of\ncertain class actions to federal court, as well as for their\nsubsequent disposition:\u201cAny covered class action brought in any\nState court involving a covered security, as set forth in\nsubsection (b) of this section, shall be removable to the Federal\ndistrict court for the district in which the action is pending, and\nshall be subject to subsection (b) of this section.\u201dThe first chunk of that provision identifies the\nremovable cases, partly by way of a cross-reference (\u201cas set forth\nin subsection (b)\u201d) to the just-described class-action bar. The\nfinal clause of the provision (\u201cand shall be subject to subsection\n(b)\u201d) indicates what should happen to a barred class suitafterit has been removed: The \u201cproper course is to dismiss\u201d\nthe action.Kircherv.Putnam Funds Trust, 547\nU.\u00a0S. 633, 644 (2006) . As this Court has explained, \u00a777p(c)\n\u201cavails a defendant of a federal forum in contemplation not of\nfurther litigation over the merits of a claim brought in state\ncourt, but of termination of the proceedings altogether.\u201dId.,at 645, n.\u00a012. The point of providing that option,\neveryone here agrees, was to ensure the dismissal of a prohibited\nstate-law class action even when a state court \u201cwould not\nadequately enforce\u201d \u00a777p(b)\u2019s bar. Brief for United States asAmicus Curiae3; see Brief for Petitioners 7; Brief for\nRespondents 20.Finally, the 1933 Act\u2019s jurisdictional\nprovision, codified at \u00a777v(a), now includes two new phrases framed\nas exemptions\u2014SLUSA\u2019s self-described \u201cconforming amendments.\u201d\n112Stat. 3230; seesupra,at 3. The less significant of the\npair, for our purposes, reflects the allowance for removing certain\nclass actions described above. Against the backdrop of the 1933\nAct\u2019s general removal bar, seesupra,at 2, that added\n(italicized) material reads:\u201cExcept as provided in section 77p(c)\nof this title, no case arising under this subchapter and\nbrought in any State court of competent jurisdiction shall be\nremoved to any court of the United States.\u201dThe more important of the conforming amendments\nin this case expresses a caveat to the general rule, seesupra,at 1\u20132, that state and federal courts have concurrent\njurisdiction over all claims to enforce the 1933 Act. As amended\n(again, with the new material in italics), the relevant sentence\nnow reads:\u201cThe district courts of the United States\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. shall have jurisdiction[,] concurrent with State\nand Territorial courts,except as provided in section 77p of\nthis title with respect to covered class actions, of all suits\nin equity and actions at law brought to enforce any liability or\nduty created by this subchapter.\u201dThroughout this opinion, we refer to the\nitalicized words just above as the \u201cexcept clause.\u201d Its meaning is\nat the heart of the parties\u2019 dispute in this Court.BThe petitioners in this case are Cyan, a\ntelecommunications company, and its officers and directors\n(together, Cyan). The respondents are three pension funds and an\nindividual (together, Investors) who purchased shares of Cyan stock\nin an initial public offering. After the stock declined in value,\nthe Investors brought a damages class action against Cyan in\nCalifornia Superior Court. Their complaint alleges that Cyan\u2019s\noffering documents contained material misstatements, in violation\nof the 1933 Act. It does not assert any claims based on state\nlaw.Cyan moved to dismiss the Investors\u2019 suit for\nlack of subject matter jurisdiction. It argued that what we have\ntermed SLUSA\u2019s \u201cexcept clause\u201d\u2014i.e.,the amendment made to\n\u00a777v(a)\u2019s concurrent-jurisdiction grant\u2014stripped state courts of\npower to adjudicate 1933 Act claims in \u201ccovered class actions.\u201d The\nInvestors did not dispute that their suit qualifies as such an\naction under SLUSA\u2019s definition, see \u00a777p(f)(2). But they\nmaintained that SLUSA left intact state courts\u2019 jurisdiction over\nall suits\u2014including \u201ccovered class actions\u201d\u2014alleging only 1933 Act\nclaims. The California Superior Court agreed with the Investors and\ndenied Cyan\u2019s motion to dismiss. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 6a. The\nstate appellate courts then denied review of that ruling. Seeid.,at 15a\u201316a.We granted Cyan\u2019s petition for certiorari, 581\nU.\u00a0S. ___ (2017), to resolve a split among state and federal\ncourts about whether SLUSA deprived state courts of jurisdiction\nover \u201ccovered class actions\u201d asserting only 1933 Act\nclaims.[1]In opposing Cyan\u2019s jurisdictional position here,\nthe Federal Government asamicus curiaeraised another\nquestion: whether SLUSA enabled defendants to remove 1933 Act class\nactions from state to federal court for adjudication. See Brief for\nUnited States asAmicus Curiae23\u201331. That question is not\ndirectly presented because Cyan never attempted to remove the\nInvestors\u2019 suit. But the removal issue is related to the parties\u2019\njurisdictional arguments, and both Cyan and the Investors addressed\nit in briefing and argument. See Brief for Petitioners 39\u201340; Brief\nfor Respondents 31\u201335; Tr. of Arg. 31, 53\u201356, 74\u201376, 80.\nAccordingly, we consider as well the scope of \u00a777p(c)\u2019s removal\nauthorization.IIBy its terms, \u00a777v(a)\u2019s \u201cexcept clause\u201d does\nnothing to deprive state courts of their jurisdiction to decide\nclass actions brought under the 1933 Act. And Cyan\u2019s various\nappeals to SLUSA\u2019s purposes and legislative history fail to\novercome the clear statutory language. The statute says what it\nsays\u2014or perhaps better put here, does not say what it does not say.\nState-court jurisdiction over 1933 Act claims thus continues\nundisturbed.[2]ASLUSA\u2019s text, read most straightforwardly,\nleaves in place state courts\u2019 jurisdiction over 1933 Act claims,\nincluding when brought in class actions. Recall that the background\nrule of \u00a777v(a)\u2014in place since the 1933 Act\u2019s passage\u2014gives state\ncourts concurrent jurisdiction over all suits \u201cbrought to enforce\nany liability or duty created by\u201d that statute. Seesupra,at 1\u20132. The except clause\u2014once again, \u201cexcept as provided in\nsection 77p of this title with respect to covered class actions\u201d\u2014is\ndrafted as a limitation on that rule: It ensures that in any case\nin which \u00a777v(a) and \u00a777p come into conflict, \u00a777p will control.\nThe critical question for this case is therefore whether \u00a777p\nlimits state-court jurisdiction over class actions brought under\nthe 1933 Act. It does not. As earlier described, \u00a777p bars certain\nsecurities class actions based onstatelaw. See \u00a777p(b);supra,at 3\u20134. And as a corollary of that prohibition, it\nauthorizes removal of those suits so that a federal court can\ndismiss them. See \u00a777p(c);supra,at 4\u20135. But the section\nsays nothing, and so does nothing, to deprive state courts of\njurisdiction over class actions based onfederallaw. That\nmeans the background rule of \u00a777v(a)\u2014under which a state court may\nhear the Investors\u2019 1933 Act suit\u2014continues to govern.Cyan offers an alternative reading, in which one\nof SLUSA\u2019s definitional provisions works to alter state-court\njurisdiction. According to Cyan, the except clause\u2019s reference to\n\u201ccovered class actions\u201d points the reader to, and only to,\n\u00a777p(f)(2)\u2019s definition of that term. See Brief for Petitioners 16.\nAnd that definition states that a \u201ccovered class action\u201d is a suit\nseeking damages on behalf of more than 50 persons\u2014without\nmentioning anything about whether the suit is based on state or\nfederal law. Cyan thus concludes that the except clause exempts all\nsizable class actions\u2014including the Investors\u2019 suit\u2014from \u00a777v(a)\u2019s\nconferral of jurisdiction on state courts.But that view cannot be squared with the except\nclause\u2019s wording for two independent reasons. To start with, the\nexcept clause points to \u201csection 77p\u201d as a whole\u2014not to paragraph\n77p(f)(2). Cyan wants to cherry pick from the material covered by\nthe statutory cross-reference. But if Congress had intended to\nrefer to the definition in \u00a777p(f)(2) alone, it presumably would\nhave done so\u2014just by adding a letter, a number, and a few\nparentheticals. As this Court recently explained, \u201cCongress often\ndrafts statutes with hierarchical schemes\u2014section, subsection,\nparagraph, and on down the line.\u201dNLRBv.SW General,\nInc., 580 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 9). And\n\u201c[w]hen Congress want[s] to refer only to a particular subsection\nor paragraph, it sa[ys] so.\u201dIbid.It said no such thing in\nthe except clause.In any event, the definitional paragraph on\nwhich Cyan relies cannot be read to \u201cprovide[]\u201d an \u201cexcept[ion]\u201d to\nthe rule of concurrent jurisdiction, in the way SLUSA\u2019s except\nclause requires. A definition does not provide an exception, but\ninstead gives meaning to a term\u2014and Congress well knows the\ndifference between those two functions. Thousands of statutory\nprovisions use the phrase \u201cexcept as provided in .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d\nfollowed by a cross-reference in order to indicate that one rule\nshould prevail over another in any circumstance in which the two\nconflict; we count more than 30 such constructions in the 1933 and\n1934 Acts alone.[3] Not one of\nthose 30-plus provisions cross-references adefinition; nor\nhas Cyan pointed to a single such example from the whole rest of\nthe U.\u00a0S. Code. And the Congress enacting SLUSA had no reason\nto attempt that peculiar maneuver for the first time. If Congress\nhad wanted to deprive state courts of jurisdiction over 1933 Act\nclass actions, it had an easy way to do so: just insert into \u00a777p\nan exclusive federal jurisdiction provision (like the 1934 Act\u2019s)\nfor such suits. That rule, when combined with the except clause,\nwould have done the trick because it would have \u201cprovided\u201d an\n\u201cexcept[ion]\u201d to \u00a777v(a)\u2019s grant of concurrent jurisdiction; by\ncontrast, a mere definition of \u201ccovered class action\u201d (as a damages\nsuit on behalf of 50-plus people) does not so provide.SLUSA\u2019sotherconforming amendment\nillustrates the two ways in which Cyan\u2019s construction of the except\nclause departs from its language. Recall that \u00a777v(a) includes a\ngeneral bar on removal. Seesupra,at 2. And recall that\nSLUSA appended to that prohibition the phrase \u201c[e]xcept as provided\nin section 77p(c)\u201d to reflect the statute\u2019s new permission to\nremove certain class actions. Seesupra,at 5. Inthat\u201cexcept as provided\u201d phrase\u2014just four sentences down\nfrom the except clause central to this case\u2014Congress pinpointed a\nsubsection of \u00a777p, rather than citing the entire section for only\none of its parts. Still more, that cross-referenced subsection\ncontains an operative provision that could limit a rule, rather\nthan a mere definition of a statutory term. In short, Congress\nwrote the removal bar\u2019s except clause in just the way a reader of\nlegislation would expect\u2014and not in the wholly irregular way Cyan\nproposes for the except clause at issue here. Especially given the\ntwo provisions\u2019 \u201cinterrelationship and close proximity,\u201dCommissionerv.Lundy, 516 U.\u00a0S. 235, 250 (1996)\n, the one conforming amendment highlights how far Cyan seeks to\nstretch the text of the other.Cyan\u2019s interpretation also fits poorly with the\nremainder of the statutory scheme. Because Cyan treats the broad\ndefinition of \u201ccovered class action\u201d as altering \u00a777v(a)\u2019s\njurisdictional grant, its construction would prevent state courts\nfrom deciding any 1933 Act class suits seeking damages for more\nthan 50 plaintiffs. That would include suits not involving a\n\u201ccovered security\u201d\u2014i.e.,a security traded on a national\nstock exchange. \u00a777p(f)(3); Brief for Petitioners 29 (conceding\nthat point). But this Court has emphasized that SLUSA\u2019s operative\nprovisions (including its state-law class-action bar, see \u00a777p(b))\napply to only \u201ctransactions in covered securities\u201d: The statute\n\u201cex- presses no concern\u201d with \u201ctransactions in uncovered securi-\nties\u201d\u2014precisely because they are not traded on national markets.Chadbourne & Parke LLPv.Troice, 571 U.\u00a0S.\n377 , ___ (2014) (slip. op., at 9); see Brief for United States asAmicus Curiae16\u201317 (SLUSA does not regard suits involving\nuncovered securities as \u201ca matter of distinct federal concern\u201d).\nThose securities, the Court explained, are \u201cprimarily of state\nconcern,\u201d and SLUSA \u201cmaintains state legal authority\u201d to address\nthem.Chadbourne, 571 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 13).\nExcept that under Cyan\u2019s view, SLUSA would not. Instead, the law\nwould strip state courts of jurisdiction over suits about\nsecurities raising no particular national interest. That result is\nout of line with SLUSA\u2019s overall scope.And finally, Cyan\u2019s take on the except clause\nreads too much into a mere \u201cconforming amendment.\u201d 112Stat. 3230.\nThe change Cyan claims that clause made to state-court jurisdiction\nis the very opposite of a minor tweak. When Congress passed SLUSA,\nstate courts had for 65 years adjudicated all manner of 1933 Act\ncases, including class actions. Indeed, defendants could not even\nremove those cases to federal court, as schemes of concurrent\njurisdiction almost always allow. Seesupra,at 2. State\ncourts thus had as much or more power over the 1933 Act\u2019s\nenforcement as over any federal statute\u2019s. To think Cyan right, we\nwould have to believe that Congress upended that entrenched\npractice not by any direct means, but instead by way of a\nconforming amendment to \u00a777v(a) (linked, in its view, with only a\ndefinition). But Congress does not make \u201cradical\u2014but entirely\nimplicit\u2014change[s]\u201d through \u201ctechnical and conforming amendments.\u201dDirector of Revenue of Mo.v.CoBank ACB, 531\nU.\u00a0S. 316, 324 (2001) (internal quotation marks omitted). Or\nto use the more general (and snappier) formulation of that rule,\nrelevant to all \u201cancillary provisions,\u201d Congress does not \u201chide\nelephants in mouseholes.\u201dWhitmanv.American Trucking\nAssns., Inc., 531 U.\u00a0S. 457, 468 (2001) . That is yet one\nmore reason to reject Cyan\u2019s view of SLUSA\u2019s text.BFaced with such recalcitrant statutory\nlanguage, Cyan stakes much of its case on legislative purpose and\nhistory. See Brief for Petitioners 20\u201333, 36\u201337; Reply Brief 7\u201311,\n17\u201321. Its claims come in two forms\u2014one relating to the goals of\nSLUSA as a whole and the other relating to the aims of the except\nclause. Even assuming clear text can ever give way to purpose, Cyan\nwould need some monster arguments on this score to create doubts\nabout SLUSA\u2019s meaning. The points Cyan raises come nowhere close to\nthat level.1According to Cyan\u2019s broad purposive argument,\nCongress could not \u201cmake good on the promise of the Reform\nAct\u201d\u2014which was its principal intention in enacting SLUSA\u2014without\ndivesting state courts of jurisdiction over all sizable 1933 Act\nclass actions. Brief for Petitioners 20. Remember that the Reform\nAct contained a number of procedural measures (for example, a\nsworn-certification requirement for lead plaintiffs, see\n\u00a777z\u20131(a)(2)(A)) that apply only in federal court. Seesupra,at 2\u20133. Plaintiffs bringing 1933 Act class actions\ncould avoid those provisions simply by filing in state court; after\nall, those suits were not even removable by defendants. \u201cSo,\u201d Cyan\nclaims, \u201cCongress enacted SLUSA to finish the job\u201d\u2014by shutting down\nthe state forum and shifting all 1933 Act class actions to the\nfederal one. Brief for Petitioners 21. In support of that view,\nCyan cites several statements in SLUSA\u2019s legislative reports\u2014in\nparticular, that SLUSA\u2019s purpose was \u201cto prevent plaintiffs from\nseeking to evade the protections that Federal law provides against\nabusive litigation by filing suit in State, rather than in Federal,\ncourt.\u201d H.\u00a0R. Conf. Rep. No. 105\u2013803, p.\u00a013 (1998); see\nH.\u00a0R. Rep. No. 105\u2013640, pp. 8\u20139 (1998); S.\u00a0Rep. No.\n105\u2013182, p.\u00a03 (1998).But to begin with, Cyan ignores a different way\nin which SLUSA \u201cserve[d] the [Reform Act\u2019s] objectives,\u201d Brief for\nPetitioners 11\u2014which our view of the statute fully effects. Recall\nthat the Reform Act also included substantive sections protecting\ndefendants (like a safe harbor for forward-looking statements) in\nsuits brought under the federal securities laws. See \u00a777z\u20132;supra,at 2. Plaintiffs could\u2014and did\u2014avoid those provisions\nby bringing their complaints of securities misconduct under state\nlaw instead. Seesupra,at 3. Hence emerged SLUSA\u2019s bar on\nstate-law class actions (and its removal provision to ensure their\ndismissal)\u2014which guaranteed that the Reform Act\u2019s heightened\nsubstantive standards would govern all future securities class\nlitigation. SLUSA itself highlights that aim: Its preamble states\nthat the statute is designed \u201cto limit the conduct of securities\nclass actions under State law, and for other purposes.\u201d 112Stat.\n3227. So too, this Court has underscored, over and over, SLUSA\u2019s\n\u201cpurpose to preclude certain vexing state-law class actions.\u201dKircher, 547 U.\u00a0S., at 645, n.\u00a012; seeDabit, 547 U.\u00a0S., at 82 (SLUSA stopped plaintiffs from\n\u201cbringing class actions under state law\u201d);Amgen Inc.v.Connecticut Retirement Plans and Trust Funds, 568 U.\u00a0S.\n455, 476 (2013) (SLUSA \u201ccurtailed plaintiffs\u2019 ability to evade the\n[Reform Act] by bringing class-action suits under state rather than\nfederal law\u201d). That object\u2014which SLUSA\u2019s text actually\nreflects\u2014does not depend on stripping state courts of jurisdiction\nover 1933 Act class suits, as Cyan proposes. For wherever those\nsuits go forward, the Reform Act\u2019s substantive protections\nnecessarily apply.Still more, SLUSA ensured that federal courts\nwould play the principal role in adjudicating securities class\nactions by means of its revisions to the1934Act. As\nexplained earlier, SLUSA amended that statute in the same main way\nit did the 1933 Act\u2014by adding a state-law class-action bar. See\n\u00a778bb(f\u00a0)(1);supra,at 3. But there, the change had a\ndouble effect: Because federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction\nover 1934 Act claims, forcing plaintiffs to bring class actions\nunder the 1934 statute instead of state law also forced them to\nfile in federal court. That meant the bulk of securities class\nactions would proceed in federal court\u2014because the 1934 Act\nregulates all trading of securities whereas the 1933 Act addresses\nonly securities offerings. SeeBlue Chip Stamps, 421\nU.\u00a0S., at 752 (characterizing the 1933 Act as \u201ca far narrower\nstatute\u201d). So even without Cyan\u2019s contrived reading of the except\nclause, SLUSA largely accomplished the purpose articulated in its\nConference Report: moving securities class actions to federal\ncourt.To be sure, \u201clargely\u201d does not mean\n\u201centirely\u201d\u2014but then again, we do not generally expect statutes to\nfulfill 100% of all of their goals. See,e.g., Freemanv.Quicken Loans, Inc., 566 U.\u00a0S. 624, 637 (2012) (\u201cNo\nlegislation pursues its purposes at all costs\u201d (internal quotation\nmarks and alterations omitted)). Under our reading of SLUSA, all\ncovered securities class actions must proceed under federal law;\nmost (i.e.,those alleging 1934 Act claims) must proceed in\nfederal court; some (i.e.,those alleging 1933 Act claims)\nmay proceed in state court. We do not know why Congress declined to\nrequire as well that 1933 Act class actions be brought in federal\ncourt; perhaps it was because of the long and unusually pronounced\ntradition of according authority to state courts over 1933 Act\nlitigation. Seesupra,at 11\u201312. But in any event, we will\nnot revise that legislative choice, by reading a conforming\namendment and a definition in a most improbable way, in an effort\nto make the world of securities litigation more consistent or pure.\nThis Court has long rejected the notion that \u201cwhateverfurthers the statute\u2019s primary objective must be the law.\u201dRodriguezv.United States, 480 U.\u00a0S. 522, 526\n(1987) (per curiam). Even if Congress could or should have\ndone more, still it \u201cwrote the statute it wrote\u2014meaning, a statute\ngoing so far and no further.\u201dMichiganv.Bay Mills\nIndian Community, 572 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at\n11) (internal quotation marks omitted).2Yet Cyan has a final argument\u2014that the except\nclause would serve no purpose at all unless it works as Cyan says.\nSee Brief for Petitioners 32\u201333; Reply Brief 8\u201311. Here, Cyan\nrelies on an indubitable puzzle. Section 77v(a), as amended by\nSLUSA, gives state courts jurisdiction over1933 Actsuits\n\u201cexcept as provided in \u00a777p.\u201d But \u00a777p provides a bar on only\ncertainstate-lawsuits. So, Cyan contends, unless we take\nup its invitation to look to \u00a777p(f)(2)\u2019s definition of \u201ccovered\nclass action,\u201d the except clause excepts \u201cexactly nothing.\u201d Reply\nBrief 8. (To use an example of our own, it would be as if a parent\ntold her child \u201cyou may have fruit after dinner, except for\nlollipops.\u201d) What on earth, Cyan asks, would be the point of such a\nprovision?The Investors answer that question with a theory\nabout why Congress enacted the except clause. In their view, the\nclause was meant to deal with \u201cmixed\u201d securities class\nactions\u2014containing both claims brought under the 1933 Act and\nclaims arising under state law. See Brief for Respondents 12\u201313. If\nnot for the except clause, the Investors posit, state courts would\nhave been uncertain about how to handle those suits. Section 77p\nclearly instructs courts not to adjudicate the state-law claims;\nbut (the Investors continue) \u00a777v(a) gives state courts\njurisdiction over entire \u201cactions\u201d brought to enforce the 1933 Act,\neven if they include additional state-law claims. What, then, to\ndo? According to the Investors, the except clause\u2019s purpose was to\nresolve that statutory conflict by making clear that \u00a777p trumps\n\u00a777v(a)\u2014in other words, that a state court may not entertain\nstate-law claims precluded by \u00a777p(b) even when they are conjoined\nwith 1933 Act claims falling within \u00a777v(a)\u2019s grant of\njurisdiction.Truth be told, we are not sure whether Congress\nhad that issue in mind. On the one hand (and contrary to what the\nInvestors say), we doubt that the except clause was really\nnecessary to address mixed class actions. Even without that clause,\na competent state court faced with such a suit would understand\nthat \u00a777p requires dismissal of the state-law claims\u2014and that\n\u00a777v(a)\u2019s jurisdictional grant over 1933 Act suits is not to the\ncontrary. But on the other hand (and now supporting the Investors\u2019\nprincipal point), Congress may have thought that class-action\nlawyers would still try to circumvent SLUSA by tacking a 1933 Act\nclaim onto a forbidden state-law class action, on the off chance of\nfinding an error-prone judge. (After all, the worst that could\nhappen was that the court would throw out the state-law claims,\nleaving the plaintiff with a permissible 1933 Act suit.) To prevent\nsuch gamesmanship\u2014to make clear beyond peradventure that courts\ncould not entertain the state-law half of mixed class\nactions\u2014Congress might have added the except clause.But even if Congress never specifically\nconsidered mixed suits, it could well have added the except clause\nin a more general excess of caution\u2014to safeguard \u00a777p\u2019s\nclass-action bar come whatever might. This Court has encountered\nmany examples of Congress legislating in that hyper-vigilant way,\nto \u201cremov[e] any doubt\u201d as to things not particularly doubtful in\nthe first instance.Marxv.General Revenue Corp.,\n568 U.\u00a0S. 371 \u2013384 (2013) (citingAliv.Federal\nBureau of Prisons, 552 U.\u00a0S. 214, 226 (2008) ;Fort\nStewart Schoolsv.FLRA, 495 U.\u00a0S. 641, 646 (1990)\n). (The idea, to return to our prior example, is to make sure that\neven if the child thinks orange lollipops count as fruit, she will\nnot act on that view.) And if ever Congress had reason to legislate\nin that fashion, it was in SLUSA\u2014whose very impetus lay in the\nsuccess of class-action attorneys in \u201cbypass[ing] .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nthe Reform Act.\u201dKircher, 547 U.\u00a0S., at 636. Heedful of\nthat history of machinations, Congress may have determined to\neliminate any risk\u2014even if unlikely or at the time unknown\u2014that a\npre-existing grant of power to state courts could be used to\nobstruct SLUSA\u2019s new limitation on what they could decide. And so\n(this alternative explanation goes) Congress enacted the except\nclause\u2014which, in insisting that the limitation prevailed, would\nfunction as the ultimate (though with any luck, unneeded) fail-safe\ndevice.[4]But the most important response to this\npurposive argument echoes what we have said before about the\nweaknesses of Cyan\u2019s own construction of the except clause. In the\nend, the uncertainty surrounding Congress\u2019s reasons for drafting\nthat clause does not matter. Nor does the possibility that the risk\nCongress addressed (whether specific or inchoate) did not exist.\nBecause irrespective of those points, we have no sound basis for\ngiving the except clause a broader reading than its language can\nbear. And that is especially true in light of the dramatic change\nsuch an interpretation would work in the 1933 Act\u2019s jurisdictional\nframework. Whatever questions remain as to the except clause\u2019s\nprecise purpose\u2014and we do not gainsay there are some\u2014they do not\ngive us permission to devise a statute (and at that, a\ntransformative one) of our own.IIIOur last task is to address the Federal\nGovernment\u2019s proposed halfway-house position. The Government\nrejects Cyan\u2019s view that SLUSA stripped state courts of\njurisdiction over 1933 Act class actions, for roughly the same\nreasons we have given. See Brief for United States asAmicus\nCuriae11\u201323. But like Cyan, the Government believes that\n\u201cCongress would not have been content to leave\u201d such suits \u201cstuck\nin state court,\u201d where the Reform Act\u2019s procedural protections do\nnot apply.Id.,at 15 (internal quotation marks omitted). So\nthe Government offers a reading of SLUSA\u2014in particular, of\n\u00a777p(c)\u2014that would allow defendants to remove 1933 Act class\nactions to federal court, as long as they allege the kinds of\nmisconduct listed in \u00a777p(b) (e.g.,false statements or\ndeceptive devices in connection with a covered security\u2019s purchase\nor sale). Seeid.,at 24\u201325.But most naturally read, \u00a777p(c)\u2014SLUSA\u2019s\nexception to the 1933 Act\u2019s general bar on removal\u2014refutes, not\nsupports, the Government\u2019s view. Once again, seesupra,at\n4, \u00a777p(c) reads as follows:\u201cAny covered class action brought in any\nState court involving a covered security, as set forth in\nsubsection (b) of this section, shall be removable to the Federal\ndistrict court for the district in which the action is pending, and\nshall be subject to subsection (b) of this section.\u201dIn other words, the covered class actions\ndescribed in \u00a777p(b) can be removed to federal court (and, once\nthere, shall be subject to dismissal because precluded, seesupra,at 5). And which are the covered class actions\ndescribed in \u00a777p(b)? By this point, no one should have to be\nreminded: They arestate-lawclass actions alleging\nsecurities misconduct. See \u00a777p(b) (prohibiting \u201cclass action[s]\nbased upon the statutory or common law of any State\u201d). So those\nstate-law suits are removable. But conversely,federal-lawsuits like this one\u2014alleging only 1933 Act claims\u2014are not \u201cclass\naction[s] .\u00a0.\u00a0. as set forth in subsection (b).\u201d So they\nremain subject to the 1933 Act\u2019s removal ban.In fact, this Court already held as much, by\nconcluding inKircherthat \u00a7\u00a777p(b) and 77p(c) apply to the\nexact same universe of class actions. See 547 U.\u00a0S., at\n643\u2013644.Kircherinvolved a securities suit that was\nunaffected by \u00a777p(b)\u2019s class-action bar\u2014there, not because it was\nbased on federal law but because it involved a form of conduct\nfalling outside that subsection. The Court of Appeals decided that\nthe suit could be removed under \u00a777p(c) even though it was not\nprecluded by \u00a777p(b), thinking (as we later put it) that the\nremoval issue and \u201cthe preclusion issue [were] distinct.\u201dId., at 638. We flatly rejected that understanding of the\nrelationship between \u00a777p(b) and \u00a777p(c). The \u201cstraightforward\nreading\u201d of those two provisions, we explained, is that removal is\n\u201climited to those [actions] precluded by the terms of subsection\n(b).\u201dId.,at 643. And if that were not clear enough, we\nsaid it again: Removal under \u00a777p(c) is \u201crestricted to precluded\nactions defined by subsection (b).\u201dId.,at 643\u2013644. And\njust to pound the point home, we said it yet a third time: \u201cA\ncovered [class] action is removable if it is precluded.\u201dId.,at 646.Kircherthus forecloses the Government\u2019s\nargument. Section 77p(b) does not preclude federal-law class\nactions. So under our decision, \u00a777p(c) does not authorize their\nremoval.[5]The Government responds with a novel way of\nunderstanding \u00a777p(c), which it thinks would allow us to disregardKircherwhen a class action like this one is based on\nfederal law. In the Government\u2019s view, first presented at oral\nargument, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 32\u201333, the words \u201cas set forth in\nsubsection (b)\u201d do not modify the entire preceding phrase\n(basically, any large class action involving a covered security).\nInstead, the Government claims, those words modify only the shorter\nphrase \u201cinvolving a covered security.\u201d To support that view, the\nGovernment invokes the \u201crule of the last antecedent\u201d\u2014under which\n\u201cthe limiting clause is most naturally applied to the thing that\ncomes immediately before it.\u201dId.,at 36. The Government\nthen presents a theory of how subsection (b) \u201cset[s] forth\u201d the\n\u201cinvolv[ement]\u201d of a covered security. \u201c[T]o figure out what that\nmeans,\u201d the Government contends, \u201cyou look at [\u00a777p](b)(1) and\n(b)(2), which talk about certain types of misconduct\u201d\u2014for example,\nfalse statements or deceptive devices in connection with a covered\nsecurity\u2019s sale.Id.,at 33\u201334. As long as conduct of that\nkind is implicated in a suit, the Government concludes, it can be\nremoved\u2014even if it is based on federal law and thus does not fall\nwithin \u00a777p(b) as a whole. That view is consistent withKircher\u2019s result because the action there did not involve\nthe conduct described in \u00a7\u00a777p(b)(1) and (2). And as toKircher\u2019s rationale .\u00a0.\u00a0. well, we should feel\nfree to ignore it.But even putting aside respect for precedent,\nthat argument is in many ways flawed. To start with, the Government\nprovides no good reason to think that \u201cas set forth in subsection\n(b)\u201d modifies only the phrase \u201cinvolving a covered security.\u201d As\nstated above, the most natural way to view the modifier is as\napplying to the entire preceding clause\u2014again, \u201c[a]ny covered class\naction brought in any State court involving a covered security.\u201d\nSeesupra,at 19. That is so because that clause hangs\ntogether as a unified whole, referring to a single thing (a type of\nclass action). Consider the following, grammatically identical\nconstruction: \u201cThe woman dressed to the nines carrying an umbrella,\nas shown in the picture .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d Would anyone think that\n\u201cas shown in the picture\u201d referred to anything less than the\nwell-attired and rain-readywoman? No. And so too here, the\nmodifier goes back to the beginning of the preceding clause. The\nrule of the last antecedent is not to the contrary. We have applied\nthat rule when the alternative reading would \u201cstretch[] the\nmodifier too far\u201d by asking it to qualify a remote or otherwise\ndisconnected phrase.Jamav.Immigration and Customs\nEnforcement, 543 U.\u00a0S. 335, 342 (2005) ;Lockhartv.United States, 577 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op.,\nat 4) (using the rule \u201cwhere it takes more than a little mental\nenergy to process\u201d a statute\u2019s component parts, \u201cmaking it a heavy\nlift to carry the modifier across them all\u201d).[6] By contrast, we have not applied the rule when\nthe modifier directly follows a concise and \u201cintegrated\u201d clause.Jama, 543 U.\u00a0S., at 344, n.\u00a04. As it does\nhere.But let us assume that the rule of the last\nantecedent governs: The Government then misapplies it by attaching\nthe modifier to somethingmorethan the last thing before\nit. The rule, correctly used, would insist that \u201cas set forth in\nsubsection (b)\u201d modifies only \u201ca covered security\u201d\u2014because that is\nthe closest \u201cnoun or noun phrase\u201d that the modifier could\nreasonably reference. A. Scalia & B. Garner, Reading Law: The\nInterpretation of Legal Texts 144 (2012) (quoting R. Burchfield,\nFowler\u2019s Modern English Usage (3d ed. 1996)). But that standard way\nof applying the rule would not aid the Government\u2019s construction,\nso it goes back yet another word: It attaches \u201cas set forth in\nsubsection (b)\u201d to the longer phrase\u2014and a verb phrase at\nthat\u2014\u201cinvolvinga covered security.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 35.\nThat maneuver has no grammatical basis. (It is as if, in the\nexample offered above, someone claimed that \u201cas shown in the\npicture\u201d modified not the woman, nor even the umbrella, but instead\nthe in-between verb phrase \u201ccarryingan umbrella.\u201d) The\nGovernment is choosing where to start in the sentence (that is,\nwhich words to qualify) based only on what best serves its\nargument.But let us even assume that \u201cas set forth in\nsubsection (b)\u201d modifies \u201cinvolving a covered security\u201d: The\nlanguage would still fail to explain the Government\u2019s position.\nRemember that the Government reads the resulting phrase (again,\n\u201cinvolving a covered security, as set forth in subsection (b)\u201d) to\npoint only to the forms of wrongful conduct listed in \u00a7\u00a777p(b)(1)\nand (2)\u2014for example, false statements or deceptive devices in\nsecurities sales. Seesupra,at 21. The problem is that no\none would describe those misdeeds with that phrase. If Congress had\nmeant to refer only to that behavior, rather than to everything in\n\u00a777p(b), it would have done two things differently. First, Congress\nwould have written \u201cas set forth in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2)\u201d\ninstead of \u201cas set forth in subsection (b)\u201d as a whole. Seesupra,at 9 (explaining that when Congress wants to refer\nonly to a particular subsection or paragraph, it says so). And\nsecond, Congress would have written something like \u201cinvolving\nallegations of misconduct,\u201d rather than \u201cinvolving a covered\nsecurity\u201d\u2014because the latter phrase does not even passably describe\n\u00a7\u00a777(b)(1) and (2)\u2019s catalog of vices. We will not read \u201cinvolving\na covered security, as set forth in subsection (b)\u201d to mean\n\u201cinvolving allegations of misconduct, as set forth in paragraphs\n(b)(1) and (b)(2)\u201d when Congress did not enact that formulation.\nSeeLozanov.Montoya Alvarez, 572 U.\u00a0S. 1 , ___\n(2014) (slip op., at 14) (\u201cGiven that the drafters did not adopt\nthat alternative, the natural implication is that they did not\nintend\u201d to do so).And (finally, we promise) even if we could put\nout of mind all these difficulties, the Government\u2019s position runs\naground on \u00a777p(c)\u2019s last clause, which states that removed class\nactions \u201cshall be subject to subsection (b).\u201d That clause, properly\nunderstood, points toward dismissal of a removed action. As we\nearlier explained, and the Government concedes, Congress enacted\n\u00a777p(c)\u2019s removal provision out of \u201cconcern[] that state courts\nwould not adequately enforce\u201d \u00a777p(b)\u2019s state-law class-action\nprohibition. Brief for United States asAmicus Curiae3; seesupra,at 5. The idea was to allow removal so that a federal\ncourt could act as a backstop and order a class action\u2019s\ndismissal\u2014thereby \u201csubject[ing]\u201d it to \u00a777p(b)\u2019s bar.Kircherspecifically said as much: Section 77p(c) \u201cavails a\ndefendant of a federal forum in contemplation not of further\nlitigation over the merits of a claim brought in state court, but\nof termination of the proceedings altogether.\u201d 547 U.\u00a0S., at\n645, n.\u00a012; seesupra,at 5. But of course, the\nGovernment contemplates \u201cfurther litigation\u201d\u2014not\u201ctermination\u201d\u2014of a removed 1933 Act class action. See Brief for\nUnited States asAmicus Curiae25. That decoupling of\n\u00a777p(c)\u2019s linkage between removal and dismissal provides the last\nreason to reject the Government\u2019s argument.At bottom, the Government makes the same mistake\nas Cyan: It distorts SLUSA\u2019s text because it thinks Congress simply\nmust have wanted 1933 Act class actions to be litigated in federal\ncourt. But this Court has no license to \u201cdisregard clear language\u201d\nbased on an in- tuition that \u201cCongress must have intended something\nbroader.\u201dBay Mills, 572 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at\n11) (internal quotation marks omitted).

Jurisdiction of offenses and\nsuits\u201c(a) Federal and State courts; venue; service\nof process; review; removal; costs\u201cThe district courts of the United States and\nthe United States courts of any Territory shall have jurisdiction\nof offenses and violations under this subchapter and under the\nrules and regulations promulgated by the Commission in respect\nthereto, and, concurrent with State and Territorial courts, except\nas provided in section 77p of this title with respect to covered\nclass actions, of all suits in equity and actions at law brought to\nenforce any liability or duty created by this subchapter. Any such\nsuit or action may be brought in the district wherein the defendant\nis found or is an inhabitant or transacts business, or in the\ndistrict where the offer or sale took place, if the defendant\nparticipated therein, and process in such cases may be served in\nany other district of which the defendant is an inhabitant or\nwherever the defendant may be found. In any action or proceeding\ninstituted by the Commission under this subchapter in a United\nStates district court for any judicial district, a subpoena issued\nto compel the attendance of a witness or the production of\ndocuments or tangible things (or both) at a hearing or trial may be\nserved at any place within the United States.

No costs shall be\nassessed for or against the Commission in any proceeding under this\nsubchapter brought by or against it in the Supreme Court or such\nother courts.\u201dNotes1Compare, e.g.,Lutherv.Countrywide Financial Corp., 195 Cal. App.\n4th 789, 797\u2013798, 125 Cal. Rptr. 3d 716, 721 (2011) (holding that\nstate courts have jurisdiction over covered class actions alleging\nonly 1933 Act claims), with,e.g.,Knoxv.Agria\nCorp., 613 F. Supp. 2d 419, 425 (SDNY 2009) (holding that state\ncourts lack jurisdiction over such actions).2This Court has often\napplied a \u201cpresumption in favor of concurrent state court\njurisdiction\u201d when interpreting federal statutes.Mimsv.Arrow Financial Services, LLC, 565 U.\u00a0S. 368, 378\n(2012) (quotingTafflinv.Levitt, 493 U.\u00a0S. 455\n\u2013459 (1990)). Cyan argues that the presumption should not apply\nhere because SLUSA included explicit \u201clanguage addressing\nstate-court jurisdiction\u201d and \u201cthe only question is [its] scope.\u201d\nReply Brief 22. We need not address that contention because SLUSA\u2019s\ntext precludes Cyan\u2019s position without aid from any\npresumption.3See,e.g.,\u00a777k(f)(1) (announcing a general rule of joint and several\nliability, \u201c[e]xcept as provided in paragraph (2),\u201d which sets out\na different liability rule for outside directors); \u00a777p(a)\n(announcing a general rule that \u201cthe rights and remedies provided\u201d\nunder the statute do not displace others, \u201c[e]xcept as provided in\nsubsection (b),\u201d which restricts the right to bring class actions\nbased on state law); \u00a777z\u20132(c) (announcing a general safe harbor\nfor certain forward-looking statements, \u201c[e]xcept as provided in\nsubsection (b),\u201d which excludes protection for a subset of\nthem).4In line with this\nprecautionary function, the except clause could do some work to\nprotect \u00a777p\u2019s state-law class-action bar in a set of suits beyond\nmixed cases. As this Court recently noted, some state-law\nsecurities claims \u201crise[] or fall[] on the plaintiff\u2019s ability to\nprove the violation\u201d of a federal securities statute.Merrill\nLynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Inc.v.Manning, 578\nU.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 7) (addressing the 1934\nAct). In such cases, we held, the state-law claims are \u201cbrought to\nenforce\u201d a liability created by the federal statute, and thus fall\nwithin that law\u2019s jurisdictional provision. Seeid.,at ___\n(slip op., at 8). In the absence of the except clause, then,\nclass-action lawyers might well have argued that such state-law\nclaims could be adjudicated under \u00a777v(a) notwithstanding \u00a777p\u2019s\nbar. Once again, we think most courts would have rejected that\nclaim and decided that \u00a777p controls\u2014but the except clause\neliminates any chance of a contrary holding.5In light of SLUSA\u2019s text\nandKircher\u2019s holding, it should come as no surprise that\nall seven Courts of Appeals to have considered the matter have\nconcluded that \u00a777p(c) allows removal of only class actions falling\nwithin \u00a777p(b)\u2019s prohibition. SeeCampbellv.American\nInt\u2019l Group, Inc., 760 F.3d 62, 64 (CADC 2014);Hidalgo-Velezv.San Juan Asset Management, 758 F.3d\n98, 103 (CA1 2014);Appertv.Morgan Stanley Dean Witter,\nInc., 673 F.3d 609, 615\u2013616 (CA7 2012);Maddenv.Cowen & Co., 576 F.3d 957, 965 (CA9 2009);Sofoniav.Principal Life Ins.

Needless to say, that\nstatutory provision is a far cry from the one at issue\nhere.",
