As the plurality explains, this case is\ndistinguishable fromNevada Dept. of Human Resourcesv.Hibbs,538 U.S.\n721(2003), which held that Congress validly abrogated the\nStates\u2019 immunity from suit for violations of the FMLA\u2019s family-care\nprovision, \u00a72612(a)(1)(C).Ante,at 5\u20136. I write separately\nonly to reiterate my view thatHibbswas wrongly decided\nbecause the family-care provision is not sufficiently linked to a\ndemonstrated pattern of unconstitutional discrimination by the\nStates. See 538 U.\u00a0S., at 745\u2013754 (Kennedy, J., joined by\nScalia and Thomas, JJ., dissenting);Tennesseev.Lane,541 U.S.\n509, 565\u2013566 (2004) (Thomas, J., dissenting). The self-care\nprovision at issue in this case is even further removed from any\nsuch pattern.",
