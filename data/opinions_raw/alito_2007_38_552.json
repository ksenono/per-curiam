    "text": "ALITO, J., DISSENTINGGALL V. UNITED STATES552 U. S. ____ (2007)SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESNO. 06-7949BRIAN MICHAEL GALL, PETITIONERv.UNITED\nSTATESon writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the eighth circuit[December 10, 2007]Justice Alito, dissenting.The fundamental question in this\ncase is whether, under the remedial decision inUnited\nStatesv.Booker,543 U. S. 220(2005), a\ndistrict court must give the policy decisions that are embodied in\nthe Sentencing Guidelines at least some significant weight in\nmaking a sentencing decision. I would answer that question in the\naffirmative and would therefore affirm the decision of the Court of\nAppeals.IInBooker,a bare\nmajority held that the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 (Sentencing\nReform Act), as amended, 18 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a73551et seq.,\n28 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7991et seq., violated the Sixth\nAmendment insofar as it required district judges to follow the\nUnited States Sentencing Guidelines, but another bare majority held\nthat this defect could be remedied by excising the two statutory\nprovisions, 18 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a73553(b)(1) and 3742(e) (2000 ed. and\nSupp. IV), that made compliance with the Guidelines mandatory. As a\nresult of these two holdings, the lower federal courts were\ninstructed that the Guidelines must be regarded as \u201ceffectively\nadvisory,\u201dBooker, 543 U. S., at 245, and that individual\nsentencing decisions are subject to appellate review for\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018reasonableness.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId.,at 262. TheBookerremedial opinion did not explain exactly what it\nmeant by a system of \u201cadvisory\u201d guidelines or by \u201creasonableness\u201d\nreview, and the opinion is open to different interpretations.It is possible to read the\nopinion to mean that district judges, after giving the Guidelines a\npolite nod, may then proceed essentially as if the Sentencing\nReform Act had never been enacted. This is how two of the dissents\ninterpreted the Court\u2019s opinion. Justice Stevens wrote that\nsentencing judges had \u201cregain[ed] the unconstrained discretion\nCongress eliminated in 1984\u201d when it enacted the Sentencing Reform\nAct.Id.,at 297. Justice Scalia stated that \u201clogic\ncompels the conclusion that the sentencing judge \u2026 has full\ndiscretion, as full as what he possessed before the Act was passed,\nto sentence anywhere within the statutory range.\u201dId., at\n305.While this is a possible understanding of the\nremedial opinion, a better reading is that sentencing judges must\nstill give the Guidelines\u2019 policy decisions some significant weight\nand that the courts of appeals must still police compliance. In a\nkey passage, the remedial opinion stated:\u201cThe district courts, while not bound to apply the\nGuidelines, must consult those Guidelines and take them into\naccount when sentencing. See 18 U. S.\u00a0C.\u00a0A. \u00a7\u00a73553(a)(4),\n(5) (Supp. 2004).But compare post, at 305 (Scalia, J., dissenting in part) (claiming that the sentencing\njudge has the same discretion \u2018he possessed before the Act was\npassed\u2019). The courts of appeals\nreview sentencing decisions for unreasonableness. These features of\nthe remaining system, while not the system Congress enacted,\nnonethelesscontinue to move sentencing in Congress\u2019 preferred\ndirection, helping to avoid excessive sentencing disparitieswhile maintaining flexibility sufficient to individualize sentences\nwhere necessary.\u201dId., at 264\u2013265 (emphasis\nadded).The\nimplication of this passage is that district courts are still\nrequired to give some deference to the policy decisions embodied in\nthe Guidelines and that appellate review must monitor compliance.\nDistrict courts must not only \u201cconsult\u201d the Guidelines, they must\n\u201ctake them into account.\u201dId.,at 264. In\naddition, the passage distances the remedial majority from Justice\nScalia\u2019s position that, under an advisory Guidelines scheme, a\ndistrict judge would have \u201cdiscretion to sentence anywhere within\nthe ranges authorized by statute\u201d so long as the judge \u201cstate[d]\nthat \u2018this court does not believe that the punishment set forth in\nthe Guidelines is appropriate for this sort of offense.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId.,at 305 (opinion dissenting in part).Moreover, in the passage\nquoted above and at other points in the remedial opinion, the Court\nexpressed confidence that appellate review for reasonableness would\nhelp to avoid \u201c\u00a0\u2018excessive sentencing disparities\u2019\u00a0\u201d and\n\u201cwould tend to iron out sentencing differences.\u201dId.,at 263. Indeed, a major theme of the\nremedial opinion, as well as our decision last Term inRitav.United States, 551 U. S. ___ (2007), was\nthat the post-Bookersentencing regime would still promote\nthe Sentencing Reform Act\u2019s goal of reducing sentencing\ndisparities. See,e.g., 551 U. S., at __ (slip op., at 8),\n__ (slip op., at 9), __ (slip op., at 15);Booker,supra,at 259\u2013260, 263\u2013264.It is unrealistic to\nthink this goal can be achieved over the long term if sentencing\njudges need only give lip service to the Guidelines. The other\nsentencing factors set out in \u00a73553(a) are so broad that they\nimpose few real restraints on sentencing judges. Seeid.,at 305 (Scalia, J., dissenting in part). Thus, if judges are\nobligated to do no more than consult the Guidelines before deciding\nupon the sentence that is, in their independent judgment,\nsufficient to serve the other \u00a73553(a) factors, federal sentencing\nwill not \u201cmove \u2026 in Congress\u2019 preferred direction.\u201dId.,at 264 (opinion of the Court). On the contrary, sentencing\ndisparities will gradually increase. Appellate decisions affirming\nsentences that diverge from the Guidelines (such as the Court\u2019s\ndecision today) will be influential, and the sentencing habits\ndeveloped during the pre-Bookerera will fade.Finally, in reading theBookerremedial opinion, we should not forget the\ndecision\u2019s constitutional underpinnings.Bookerand its\nantecedents are based on the Sixth Amendment right to trial by\njury. The Court has held that (at least under a mandatory\nguidelines system) a defendant has the right to have a jury, not a\njudge, find facts that increase the defendant\u2019s authorized\nsentence. Seeid.,at 230\u2013232;Blakelyv.Washington,542 U. S. 296, 303\u2013304\n(2004). It is telling that the rules set out in the Court\u2019s opinion\nin the present case have nothing to do with juries or factfinding\nand, indeed, that not one of the facts that bears on petitioner\u2019s\nsentence is disputed. What is at issue, instead, is the allocation\nof the authority to decide issues of substantive sentencing policy,\nan issue on which the Sixth Amendment says absolutely nothing. The\nyawning gap between the Sixth Amendment and the Court\u2019s opinion\nshould be enough to show that theBlakely-Bookerline of\ncases has gone astray.InBlakely, the\nCourt drew a distinction\u2014between judicial factfinding under a\nguidelines system and judicial factfinding under a discretionary\nsentencing system, see 542 U. S., at 309\u2013310\u2014that, in my judgment,\ncannot be defended as a matter of principle. It would be a coherent\nprinciple to hold that any fact that increases a defendant\u2019s\nsentence beyond the minimum required by the jury\u2019s verdict of guilt\nmust be found by a jury. Such a holding, however, would clash with\naccepted sentencing practice at the time of the adoption of the\nSixth Amendment. By that time, many States had enacted criminal\nstatutes that gave trial judges the discretion to select a sentence\nfrom within a prescribed range,[Footnote 1] and the First Congress enacted federal\ncriminal statutes that were cast in this mold. See An Act for the\nPunishment of certain Crimes against the United States, 1 Stat.\n112.[Footnote 2]Under a sentencing\nsystem of this type, trial judges inevitably make findings of fact\n(albeit informally) that increase sentences beyond the minimum\nrequired by the jury\u2019s verdict. For example, under a statute\nproviding that the punishment for burglary is, say, imprisonment\nfor up toxyears, the sentencing court might increase the\nsentence that it would have otherwise imposed by some amount based\non evidence introduced at trial that the defendant was armed or\nthat, before committing the crime, the defendant had told a\nconfederate that he would kill the occupants if they awakened\nduring the burglary. The only difference between this sort of\nfactfinding and the type that occurs under a guidelines system is\nthat factfinding under a guidelines system is explicit and the\neffect of each critical finding is quantified. But in both\ninstances, facts that cause a defendant to spend more time in\nprison are found by judges, not juries, and therefore no\ndistinction can be drawn as a matter of Sixth Amendment\nprinciple.The Court\u2019s acceptance\nof this distinction also produced strange collateral consequences.\nA sentencing system that gives trial judges the discretion to\nsentence within a specified range not only permits judicial\nfactfinding that may increase a sentence, such a system also gives\nindividual judges discretion to implement their own sentencing\npolicies. This latter feature, whether wise or unwise, has nothing\nto do with the concerns of the Sixth Amendment, and a principal\nobjective of the Sentencing Reform Act was to take this power out\nof the hands of individual district judges.TheBookerremedy, however, undid this congressional choice. In curing the\nSentencing Reform Act\u2019s perceived defect regarding judicial\nfactfinding,Bookerrestored to the district courts at\nleast a measure of the policymaking authority that the Sentencing\nReform Act had taken away. (How much of this authority was given\nback is, of course, the issue here.)I recognize that the\nCourt is committed to theBlakely-Bookerline of cases,\nbut we are not required to continue along a path that will take us\nfurther and further off course. Because theBookerremedial opinion may be read to require sentencing judges to give\nweight to the Guidelines, I would adopt that interpretation and\nthus minimize the gap between what the Sixth Amendment requires and\nwhat our cases have held.IIARead\nfairly, the opinion of the Court of Appeals holds that the District\nCourt did not properly exercise its sentencing discretion because\nit did not give sufficient weight to the policy decisions reflected\nin the Guidelines. Petitioner was convicted of a serious crime,\nconspiracy to distribute \u201cecstasy.\u201d He distributed thousands of\npills and made between $30,000 and $40,000 in profit. Although he\neventually left the conspiracy, he did so because he was worried\nabout apprehension. The Sentencing Guidelines called for a term of\nimprisonment of 30 to 37 months, but the District Court imposed a\nterm of probation.Compelled\nto interpret theBookerremedial opinion, the District\nCourt, it appears, essentially chose the interpretation outlined in\nJustice Stevens\u2019 and Justice Scalia\u2019s dissents. The District Court\nconsidered the sentence called for by the Guidelines, but I see no\nevidence that the District Court deferred to the Guidelines to any\nsignificant degree. Rather, the court determined what it thought\nwas appropriate under the circumstances and sentenced petitioner\naccordingly.If the question before\nus was whether a reasonable jurist could conclude that a sentence\nof probation was sufficient in this case to serve the purposes of\npunishment set out in 18 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a73553(a)(2), the District\nCourt\u2019s decision could not be disturbed. But because I believe that\nsentencing judges must still give some significant weight to the\nGuidelines sentencing range, the Commission\u2019s policy statements,\nand the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities,\n\u00a73553(a)(3), (4), and (5) (2000 ed. and Supp. V), I agree with the\nEighth Circuit that the District Court did not properly exercise\nits discretion.Appellate review for\nabuse of discretion is not an empty formality. A decision calling\nfor the exercise of judicial discretion \u201chardly means that it is\nunfettered by meaningful standards or shielded from thorough\nappellate review.\u201dAlbemarle Paper Co.v.Moody,422 U. S. 405,\n416 (1975). Accord,United Statesv.Taylor,487 U. S. 326,\n336 (1988);Franksv.Bowman Transp. Co.,424 U. S. 747,\n783 (1976) (Powell, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).\nAnd when a trial court is required by statute to take specified\nfactors into account in making a discretionary decision, the trial\ncourt must be reversed if it \u201cignored or slighted a factor that\nCongress has deemed pertinent.\u201dTaylor,supra, at\n337. SeeHensleyv.Eckerhart,461 U. S. 424, 438\u2013440\n(1983) (finding an abuse of discretion where the District Court\n\u201cdid not properly consider\u201d 1 of 12 factors Congress found relevant\nto the amount of attorney\u2019s fees when passing the Civil Rights\nAttorney\u2019s Fees Awards Act of 1976, 42 U.

Co.v.NLRB,316 U. S. 31, 46, 47\n(1942) (finding an abuse of discretion where the National Labor\nRelations Board sought to fulfill one congressional objective but\n\u201cwholly ignore[d] other and equally important Congressional\nobjectives\u201d).Here, the District Court\n\u201cslighted\u201d the factors set out in 18 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a73553(a)(3),\n(4), and (5) (2000 ed. and Supp. V)\u2014namely, the Guidelines\nsentencing range, the Commission\u2019s policy statements, and the need\nto avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities. Although the\nGuidelines called for a prison term of at least 30 months, the\nDistrict Court did not require any imprisonment\u2014not one day. The\nopinion of the Court makes much of the restrictions and burdens of\nprobation, seeante, at 9\u201310, but in the real world there\nis a huge difference between imprisonment and probation. If the\nDistrict Court had given any appreciable weight to the Guidelines,\nthe District Court could not have sentenced petitioner to probation\nwithout very strong countervailing considerations.The court listed five\nconsiderations as justification for a sentence of probation: (1)\npetitioner\u2019s \u201cvoluntary and explicit withdrawal from the\nconspiracy,\u201d (2) his \u201cexemplary behavior while on bond,\u201d (3) \u201cthe\nsupport manifested by family and friends,\u201d (4) \u201cthe lack of\ncriminal history, especially a complete lack of any violent\ncriminal history,\u201d (5) and his age at the time of the offense, 21.\nApp. 97.Two of the\nconsiderations that the District Court cited\u2014\u201cthe support\nmanifested by family and friends\u201d and his age,ibid.\u2014amounted to a direct rejection of the Sentencing\nCommission\u2019s authority to decide the most basic issues of\nsentencing policy. In the Sentencing Reform Act, Congress required\nthe Sentencing Commission to consider and decide whether certain\nspecified factors\u2014including \u201cage,\u201d \u201ceducation,\u201d \u201cprevious\nemployment record,\u201d \u201cphysical condition,\u201d \u201cfamily ties and\nresponsibilities,\u201d and \u201ccommunity ties\u201d\u2014\u201chave any relevance to the\nnature [and] extent\u00a0\u2026 of an appropriate sentence.\u201d 28 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a7994(d). These factors come up with great frequency, and\njudges in the pre-Sentencing Reform Act era disagreed regarding\ntheir relevance. Indeed, some of these factors were viewed by some\njudges as reasons for increasing a sentence and by others as\nreasons for decreasing a sentence. For example, if a defendant had\na job, a supportive family, and friends, those factors were\nsometimes viewed as justifying a harsher sentence on the ground\nthat the defendant had squandered the opportunity to lead a\nlaw-abiding life. Alternatively, those same factors were sometimes\nviewed as justifications for a more lenient sentence on the ground\nthat a defendant with a job and a network of support would be less\nlikely to return to crime. If each judge is free to implement his\nor her personal views on such matters, sentencing disparities are\ninevitable.In response to Congress\u2019\ndirection to establish uniform national sentencing policies\nregarding these common sentencing factors, the Sentencing\nCommission issued policy statements concluding that \u201cage,\u201d \u201cfamily\nties,\u201d and \u201ccommunity ties\u201d are relevant to sentencing only in\nunusual cases. See United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines\nManual \u00a7\u00a75H1.1 (age), 5H1.6 (family and community ties) (Nov.\n2006). The District Court in this case did not claim that there was\nanything particularly unusual about petitioner\u2019s family or\ncommunity ties or his age, but the court cited these factors as\njustifications for a sentence of probation. Although the District\nCourt was obligated to take into account the Commission\u2019s policy\nstatements and the need to avoid sentencing disparities, the\nDistrict Court rejected Commission policy statements that are\ncritical to the effort to reduce such disparities.The District Court\nrelied on petitioner\u2019s lack of criminal history, but criminal\nhistory (or the lack thereof) is a central factor in the\ncalculation of the Guidelines range. Petitioner was given credit\nfor his lack of criminal history in the calculation of his\nGuidelines sentence. Consequently, giving petitioner additional\ncredit for this factor was nothing more than an expression of\ndisagreement with the policy determination reflected in the\nGuidelines range.The District Court\nmentioned petitioner\u2019s \u201cexemplary behavior while on bond,\u201d App. 97,\nbut this surely cannot be regarded as a weighty factor.Finally, the District\nCourt was plainly impressed by petitioner\u2019s \u201cvoluntary and explicit\nwithdrawal from the conspiracy.\u201dIbid.As the Government\nargues, the legitimate strength of this factor is diminished by\npetitioner\u2019s motivation in withdrawing. He did not leave the\nconspiracy for reasons of conscience, and he made no effort to stop\nthe others in the ring. He withdrew because he had become afraid of\napprehension. 446 F. 3d 884, 886 (CA8 2006). While the District\nCourt was within its rights in regarding this factor and\npetitioner\u2019s \u201cself-rehabilitat[ion],\u201d App. 75, as positive\nconsiderations, they are not enough, in light of the Guidelines\u2019\ncall for a 30- to 37-month prison term, to warrant a sentence of\nprobation.BIn reaching\nthe opposite conclusion, the Court attacks straw men. The Court\nunjustifiably faults the Eighth Circuit for using what it\ncharacterizes as a \u201crigid mathematical formula.\u201dAnte, at\n8. The Eighth Circuit (following a Seventh Circuit opinion) stated\nthat a trial judge\u2019s justifications for a sentence outside the\nGuidelines range must be \u201cproportional to the extent of the\ndifference between the advisory range and the sentence imposed.\u201d\n446 F.\u00a03d, at 889 (quotingUnited Statesv.Claiborne, 439 F.\u00a03d 479, 481 (CA8 2006), in turn\nquotingUnited Statesv.Johnson, 427 F.\u00a03d\n423, 426\u2013427 (CA7 2005); internal quotation marks omitted). Taking\nthis language literally as requiring a mathematical computation,\nthe Court has an easy time showing that mathematical precision is\nnot possible:\u201c[T]he mathematical approach\nassumes the existence of some ascertainable method of assigning\npercentages to various justifications. Does withdrawal from a\nconspiracy justify more or less than, say, a 30% reduction? \u2026 What\npercentage, if any, should be assigned to evidence that a defendant\nposes no future threat to society, or to evidence that innocent\nthird parties are dependent on him?\u201dAnte, at\n10.This\ncriticism is quite unfair. It is apparent that the Seventh and\nEighth Circuits did not mean to suggest that proportionality review\ncould be reduced to a mathematical equation, and certainly the\nEighth Circuit in this case did not assign numbers to the various\njustifications offered by the District Court. All that the Seventh\nand Eighth Circuits meant, I am convinced, is what this Court\u2019s\nopinion states,i.e., that \u201cthe extent of the difference\nbetween a particular sentence and the recommended Guidelines range\u201d\nis a relevant consideration in determining whether the District\nCourt properly exercised its sentencing discretion.Ante,\nat 2.This Court\u2019s opinion is\nalso wrong in suggesting that the Eighth Circuit\u2019s approach was\ninconsistent with the abuse-of-discretion standard of appellate\nreview.Ante, at 10. The Eighth Circuit stated\nunequivocally that it was conducting abuse-of-discretion review,\n446 F.\u00a03d, at 888\u2013889; abuse-of-discretion review is not\ntoothless; and it is entirely proper for a reviewing court to find\nan abuse of discretion when important factors\u2014in this case, the\nGuidelines, policy statements, and the need to avoid sentencing\ndisparities\u2014are \u201cslighted.\u201dTaylor, 487 U. S., at 337. The\nmere fact that the Eighth Circuit reversed is hardly proof that the\nEighth Circuit did not apply the correct standard of\nreview.Because I believe that\nthe Eighth Circuit correctly interpreted and applied the standards\nset out in theBookerremedial opinion, I must\nrespectfully dissent.[Footnote\n3]Footnote\n1To take some examples,\nConnecticut, as of 1784, punished burglary and robbery without\nviolence with imprisonment of up to 10 years \u201cat the Discretion of\nthe Superior Court before whom the Conviction is had.\u201d See Acts and\nLaws of the State of Connecticut 18 (1784). A 1749 Delaware law\npunished assault of a parent with imprisonment of up to 18 months.\nLaws of the State of Delaware 306 (1797). A 1793 Maryland law gave\ncourts the ability to \u201cin their discretion, adjudge\u201d criminal\ndefendants \u201cto serve and labour for any time, in their discretion,\nnot exceeding\u201d specified terms of years. Digest of the Laws of\nMaryland 196 (T. Herty 1799). By 1785, Massachusetts allowed judges\nto sentence criminals convicted of a variety of offenses, including\nassault and manslaughter, \u201caccording to the aggravation of the\noffense,\u201d or \u201cat the discretion of the Court.\u201d The Perpetual Laws,\nof the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, from the Establishment of its\nConstitution to the First Session of the General Court A.\u00a0D.\n1788 (1788), reprinted in The First Laws of The Commonwealth of\nMassachusetts, pp. 244\u2013252 (J. Cushing comp. 1981). In 1791, New\nHampshire passed a law punishing certain assaults with imprisonment\nof up to two years, and forgery with imprisonment of up to three\nyears, at the court\u2019s discretion. See Laws of the State of New\nHampshire (1792). New Jersey, New York, North Carolina,\nPennsylvania, Rhode Island, and South Carolina likewise enacted\ncriminal statutes providing for indeterminate sentences of\nimprisonment at the discretion of the court either before, or in\nthe immediate wake of, the ratification of the Sixth Amendment.\nSee,e.g.,Laws of the State of New Jersey 210\u2013218 (1800)\n(detailing laws passed in 1796); 2 Laws of the State of New York\n45\u201348, 211, 242\u2013248, 390 (1789); Laws of the State of North\nCarolina 288, 389 (J. Iredell 1791); An Abridgment of the Laws of\nPennsylvania, Penal Laws 1\u201347 (1801) (detailing laws passed\n1790\u20131794); Public Laws of the State of Rhode Island and Providence\nPlantations 584\u2013600 (1798); Public Laws of the State of South\nCarolina 55, 61, 257, 497 (J. Grimke 1790).Footnote\n2We have often looked to\nlaws passed by the First Congress to aide interpretation of the\nBill of Rights, which that Congress proposed. See,e.g.,Harmelinv.Michigan,501 U. S. 957, 980\n(1991) (opinion of Scalia, J.) (noting, while interpreting the\nEighth Amendment, that \u201c[t]he actions of the First Congress \u2026 are\nof course persuasive evidence of what the Constitution means\u201d);Marshv.Chambers,463 U.

The Court\u2019s opinion in this case conspicuously refrains\nfrom directly addressing that question, and the opinion inKimbroughv.United States, post, p. ___, is\nexplicitly equivocal, stating that \u201cwhile the Guidelines are no\nlonger binding, closer review may be in order when the sentencing\njudge varies from the Guidelines based solely on the judge\u2019s view\nthat the Guidelines range \u2018fails properly to reflect \u00a73553(a)\nconsiderations\u2019 even in a mine-run case.\u201dPost, at 21\n(slip op., at 21) (quotingRitav.United States,\n551 U.
