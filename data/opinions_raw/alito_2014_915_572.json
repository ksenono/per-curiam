AKAMAI\nTECHNOLOGIES, INC., et\u00a0al.on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the federal circuit[June 2, 2014]Justice Alito\ndelivered the opinion of the Court.This case presents the\nquestion whether a defendant may be liable for inducing\ninfringement of a patent under 35 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7271(b) when\nno one has directly infringed the patent under \u00a7271(a) or any other\nstatutory provision. The statutory text and structure and our prior\ncase law require that we answer this question in the negative. We\naccordingly reverse the Federal Circuit, which reached the opposite\nconclusion.IARespondent the\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology is the assignee of U.\u00a0S.\nPatent No. 6,108,703 (\u2019703 patent), which claims a method of\ndelivering electronic data using a \u201ccontent delivery network,\u201d or\n\u201cCDN.\u201d Respondent Akamai Technologies, Inc., is the exclusive\nlicensee. Akamai maintains many servers distributed in various\nlocations. Proprietors of Web sites, known as \u201ccontent providers,\u201d\ncontract with Akamai to deliver their Web sites\u2019 content to\nindividual Internet users. The \u2019703 patent provides for the\ndesignation of certain components of a content provider\u2019s Web site\n(often large files, such as video or music files) to be stored on\nAkamai\u2019s servers and accessed from those servers by Internet users.\nThe process of designating components to be stored on Akamai\u2019s\nservers is known as \u201ctagging.\u201d By \u201caggregat[ing] the data demands\nof multiple content providers with differing peak usage patterns\nand serv[ing] that content from multiple servers in multiple\nlocations,\u201d 614 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d 90, 96 (Mass. 2009), as well as by\ndelivering content from servers located in the same geographic area\nas the users who are attempting to access it, Akamai is able to\nincrease the speed with which Internet users access the content of\nits customers\u2019 Web sites.Petitioner Limelight\nNetworks, Inc., also operates a CDN and carries out several of the\nsteps claimed in the \u2019703 patent. But instead of tagging those\ncomponents of its customers\u2019 Web sites that it intends to store on\nits servers (a step included in the \u2019703 patent), Limelight\nrequires its customers to do their own tagging.[1] Respondents claim that Limelight \u201cprovides\ninstructions and offers technical assistance\u201d to its customers\nregarding how to tag, 629 F.\u00a03d 1311, 1321 (CA Fed. 2010), but\nthe record is undisputed that Limelight does not tag the components\nto be stored on its servers.BIn 2006, respondents\nsued Limelight in the United States District Court for the District\nof Massachusetts, claiming patent infringement. The case was tried\nto a jury, which found that Limelight had committed infringement\nand awarded more than $40 million in damages.Respondents\u2019 victory\nwas short-lived, however. After the jury returned its verdict, the\nFederal Circuit decided Muniauction, Inc. v. Thomson Corp., 532\nF.\u00a03d 1318 (2008). In that case the Court of Appeals rejected\na claim that the defendant\u2019s method, involving bidding on financial\ninstruments using a computer system, directly infringed the\nplaintiff\u2019s patent. The defendant performed some of the steps of\nthe patented method, and its customers, to whom the defendant gave\naccess to its system along with instructions on the use of the\nsystem, performed the remaining steps. The court started from \u201cthe\nproposition that direct infringement requires a single party to\nperform every step of a claimed method.\u201d Id., at 1329. This\nrequirement is satisfied even though the steps are actually\nundertaken by multiple parties, the court explained, if a single\ndefendant \u201cexercises \u2018control or direction\u2019 over the entire process\nsuch that every step is attributable to the controlling party.\u201d\nIbid. The court held that the defendant in Muniauction was not\nliable for direct infringement because it did not exercise control\nor direction over its customers\u2019 performance of those steps of the\npatent that the defendant itself did not perform. Id., at 1330.In light of\nMuniauction, Limelight moved for reconsideration of its earlier\nmotion for judgment as a matter of law, which the District Court\nhad denied. The District Court granted the motion, concluding that\nMuniauction precluded a finding of direct infringement under\n\u00a7271(a) because infringement of the \u2019703 patent required tagging\nand Limelight does not control or direct its customers\u2019 tagging. A\npanel of the Federal Circuit affirmed, explaining that a defendant\nthat does not itself undertake all of a patent\u2019s steps can be\nliable for direct infringement only \u201cwhen there is an agency\nrelationship between the parties who perform the method steps or\nwhen one party is contractually obligated to the other to perform\nthe steps.\u201d 629 F.\u00a03d, at 1320. Since neither of these\nconditions was met in the present case, the Federal Circuit panel\nheld that Limelight could not be held liable for direct\ninfringement.[2] Ibid.The Federal Circuit\ngranted en banc review and reversed. The en banc court found it\nunnecessary to revisit its \u00a7271(a) direct infringement case law.\nInstead, it concluded that the \u201cevidence could support a judgment\nin [respondents\u2019] favor on a theory of induced infringement\u201d under\n\u00a7271(b). 692 F.\u00a03d 1301, 1319 (2012) (per curiam). This was\ntrue, the court explained, because \u00a7271(b) liability arises when a\ndefendant carries out some steps constituting a method patent and\nencourages others to carry out the remaining steps\u2014even if no one\nwould be liable as a direct infringer in such circumstances,\nbecause those who performed the remaining steps did not act as\nagents of, or under the direction or control of, the defendant. The\nCourt of Appeals did not dispute that \u201cthere can be no indirect\ninfringement without direct infringement,\u201d id., at 1308, but it\nexplained that \u201c[r]equiring proof that there has been direct\ninfringement .\u00a0.\u00a0. is not the same as requiring proof\nthat a single party would be liable as a direct infringer,\u201d id., at\n1308\u20131309 (emphasis deleted). Judge Newman and Judge Linn both\ndissented (with the latter joined by Judges Dyk, Prost, and\nO\u2019Malley).Limelight sought\ncertiorari, which we granted. 571 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2014).IIANeither the Federal\nCircuit, see 692 F.\u00a03d, at 1308, nor respondents, see Tr. of\nOral Arg. 44, dispute the proposition that liability for inducement\nmust be predicated on direct infringement. This is for good reason,\nas our case law leaves no doubt that inducement liability may arise\n\u201cif, but only if, [there is] .\u00a0.\u00a0. direct infringement.\u201d\nAro Mfg. Co. v. Convertible Top Replacement Co., 365 U.\u00a0S 336,\n341 (1961) (emphasis deleted).[3]One might think that\nthis simple truth is enough to dispose of this appeal. But the\nFederal Circuit reasoned that a defendant can be liable for\ninducing infringement under \u00a7271(b) even if no one has committed\ndirect infringement within the terms of \u00a7271(a) (or any other\nprovision of the patent laws), because direct infringement can\nexist independently of a violation of these statutory provisions.\nSee 692 F.\u00a03d, at 1314.The Federal Circuit\u2019s\nanalysis fundamentally misunderstands what it means to infringe a\nmethod patent. A method patent claims a number of steps; under this\nCourt\u2019s case law, the patent is not infringed unless all the steps\nare carried out. See, e.g., Aro, supra, at 344 (a \u201cpat-ent covers\nonly the totality of the elements in the claim and .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nno element, separately viewed, is within the grant\u201d). This\nprinciple follows ineluctably from what a patent is: the conferral\nof rights in a particular claimed set of elements. \u201cEach element\ncontained in a patent claim is deemed material to defining the\nscope of the patented invention,\u201d Warner-Jenkinson Co. v. Hilton\nDavis Chemical Co., 520 U. S. 17, 29 (1997) , and a patentee\u2019s\nrights extend only to the claimed combination of elements, and no\nfurther.The Federal Circuit\nheld in Muniauction that a method\u2019s steps have not all been\nperformed as claimed by the patent unless they are all attributable\nto the same de-fendant, either because the defendant actually\nperformed those steps or because he directed or controlled others\nwho performed them. See 532 F.\u00a03d, at 1329\u20131330. Assuming\nwithout deciding that the Federal Circuit\u2019s holding in Muniauction\nis correct, there has simply been no infringement of the method in\nwhich respondents have staked out an interest, because the\nperformance of all the patent\u2019s steps is not attributable to any\none person. And, as both the Federal Circuit and respondents admit,\nwhere there has been no direct infringement, there can be no\ninducement of infringement under \u00a7271(b).The Federal Circuit\u2019s\ncontrary view would deprive \u00a7271(b) of ascertainable standards. If\na defendant can be held liable under \u00a7271(b) for inducing conduct\nthat does not constitute infringement, then how can a court assess\nwhen a patent holder\u2019s rights have been invaded? What if a\ndefendant pays another to perform just one step of a 12-step\nprocess, and no one performs the other steps, but that one step can\nbe viewed as the most important step in the process? In that case\nthe defendant has not encouraged infringement, but no principled\nreason prevents him from being held liable for inducement under the\nFederal Circuit\u2019s reasoning, which permits inducement liability\nwhen fewer than all of a method\u2019s steps have been performed within\nthe meaning of the patent. The decision below would require the\ncourts to develop two parallel bodies of infringement law: one for\nliability for direct infringement, and one for liability for\ninducement.Section 271(f)(1)\nreinforces our reading of \u00a7271(b). That subsection imposes\nliability on a party who \u201csupplies or causes to be supplied in or\nfrom the United States all or a substantial portion of the\ncomponents of a patented invention .\u00a0.\u00a0. in such manner\nas to actively induce the combination of such components outside of\nthe United States in a manner that would infringe the patent if\nsuch combination occurred within the United States\u201d (emphasis\nadded). As this provision illustrates, when Congress wishes to\nimpose liability for inducing activity that does not itself\nconstitute direct infringement, it knows precisely how to do so.\nThe courts should not create liability for inducement of\nnon-infringing conduct where Congress has elected not to extend\nthat concept.The Federal Circuit\nseems to have adopted the view that Limelight induced infringement\non the theory that the steps that Limelight and its customers\nperform would infringe the \u2019703 patent if all the steps were\nperformed by the same person. But we have already rejected the\nnotion that conduct which would be infringing in altered\ncircumstances can form the basis for contributory infringement, and\nwe see no reason to apply a different rule for inducement. In\nDeepsouth Packing Co. v. Laitram Corp., 406 U.\u00a0S. 518 (1972) ,\na manufacturer produced components of a patented machine and then\nexported those components overseas to be assembled by its foreign\ncustomers.[4] (The assembly by\nthe foreign customers did not violate U.\u00a0S. patent laws.) In\nboth Deepsouth and this case, the conduct that the defendant\ninduced or contributed to would have been infringing if committed\nin altered circumstances: in Deepsouth if the machines had been\nassembled in the United States, see id., at 526, and in this case\nif performance of all of the claimed steps had been attributable to\nthe same person. In Deepsouth, we rejected the possibility of\ncontributory infringement because the machines had not been\nassembled in the United States, and direct infringement had\nconsequently never occurred. See id., at 526\u2013527. Similarly, in\nthis case, performance of all the claimed steps cannot be\nattributed to a single person, so direct infringement never\noccurred. Limelight cannot be liable for inducing infringement that\nnever came to pass.BRespondents\u2019\narguments in support of the Federal Circuit\u2019s reading of the\nstatute are unpersuasive. First, respondents note that tort law\nimposes liability on a defendant who harms another through a third\nparty, even if that third party would not himself be liable, and\nrespondents contend that, given the background tort principles\nagainst which the Patent Act of 1952 was enacted, it should not\nmatter that no one is liable for direct infringement in this case.\nBut the reason Limelight could not have induced infringement under\n\u00a7271(b) is not that no third party is liable for direct\ninfringement; the problem, instead, is that no direct infringement\nwas committed. Muniauction (which, again, we assume to be correct)\ninstructs that a method patent is not directly infringed\u2014and the\npatentee\u2019s interest is thus not violated\u2014unless a single actor can\nbe held responsible for the performance of all steps of the patent.\nBecause Limelight did not undertake all steps of the \u2019703 patent\nand cannot otherwise be held responsible for all those steps,\nrespondents\u2019 rights have not been violated. Unsurprisingly,\nrespondents point us to no tort case in which liability was imposed\nbecause a defendant caused an innocent third party to undertake\naction that did not violate the plaintiff\u2019s legal rights.In a related argument,\nrespondents contend that, at tort, liability sometimes attaches\nwhere two or more defendants inflict injury, even if each\ndefendant\u2019s conduct, standing alone, would not be actionable. See\nW. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, & D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton\non Torts \u00a752, p. 354 (5th ed. 1984) (multiple defendants who each\nadd negligible impurities to stream liable if aggregate impurities\ncause harm). But the rationale for imposing liability in these\ncircumstances is that the defendants collectively invaded the\nplaintiff\u2019s protected interests. See ibid. By contrast, under the\nMuniauction rule, respondents\u2019 interests in the \u2019713 patent have\nnot been invaded.Second, respondents\nseek to analogize \u00a7271(b) to the federal aiding and abetting\nstatute, 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72, and they argue that two parties\nwho divide all the necessary elements of a crime between them are\nboth guilty under \u00a72. The analogy does not hold up. The aiding and\nabetting statute must be read \u201cagainst its common-law background,\u201d\nStandefer v. United States, 447 U.\u00a0S. 10, 19 (1980) , and at\ncommon law two or more defendants, each of whom committed an\nelement of a crime, were liable as principals. See, e.g., 1 J.\nBishop, Commentaries on the Criminal Law \u00a7649, p. 392 (7th ed.\n1882). While we have drawn on criminal law concepts in the past in\ninterpreting \u00a7271(b), see Global-Tech Appliances, Inc. v. SEB\nS.\u00a0A., 563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 10\u201312), we\nthink it unlikely that Congress had this particular doctrine in\nmind when it enacted the Patent Act of 1952, given the doctrine\u2019s\ninconsistency with the Act\u2019s cornerstone principle that patentees\nhave a right only to the set of elements claimed in their patents\nand nothing further.Third, respondents\ncontend that patent law principles established before the enactment\nof the Patent Act demonstrate that a defendant that performs some\nsteps of a patent with the purpose of having its customers perform\nthe remaining steps is liable for inducing infringement. But here,\ntoo, the nature of the rights created by the Pat-ent Act defeats\nthe notion that Congress could haveintended to permit inducement\nliability where there is no underlying direct infringement.\nAccording to respondents, their understanding of the pre-1952\ndoctrine casts doubt on the Muniauction rule for direct\ninfringement under \u00a7271(a), on the ground that that rule has the\nindirect effect of preventing inducement liability where Congress\nwould have wanted it. But the possibility that the Federal Circuit\nerred by too narrowly circumscribing the scope of \u00a7271(a) is no\nreason for this Court to err a second time by misconstruing \u00a7271(b)\nto impose liability for inducing infringement where no infringement\nhas occurred.Finally, respondents,\nlike the Federal Circuit, criticize our interpretation of \u00a7271(b)\nas permitting a would-be infringer to evade liability by dividing\nperformance of a method patent\u2019s steps with another whom the\ndefendant neither directs nor controls. We acknowledge this\nconcern. Any such anomaly, however, would result from the Fed-eral\nCircuit\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7271(a) in Muniauction. A desire to\navoid Muniauction\u2019s natural consequences does not justify\nfundamentally altering the rules of inducement liability that the\ntext and structure of the Patent Act clearly require\u2014an alteration\nthat would result in its own serious and problematic consequences,\nnamely, creating for \u00a7271(b) purposes some free-floating concept of\n\u201cinfringement\u201d both untethered to the statutory text and difficult\nfor the lower courts to apply consistently.IIIRespondents ask us to\nreview the merits of the Federal Circuit\u2019s Muniauction rule for\ndirect infringement under \u00a7271(a). We decline to do so today.In the first place, the\nquestion presented is clearly focused on \u00a7271(b), not \u00a7271(a). We\ngranted certiorari on the following question: \u201cWhether the Federal\nCircuit erred in holding that a defendant may be held liable for\ninducing patent infringement under 35 U. S. C. \u00a7271(b) even though\nno one has committed direct infringement under \u00a7271(a).\u201d Pet. for\nCert. i. The question presupposes that Limelight has not committed\ndirect infringement under \u00a7271(a). And since the question on which\nwe granted certiorari did not involve \u00a7271(a), petitioner did not\naddress that important issue in its opening brief. Our decision on\nthe \u00a7271(b) question necessitates a remand to the Federal Circuit,\nand on remand, the Federal Circuit will have the opportunity to\nrevisit the \u00a7271(a) question if it so chooses.IVThe judgment below is\nreversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.Notes1In its brief, Limelight\ndisputes whether its customers actually \u201ctag\u201d within the meaning of\nthe patent. Brief for Petitioner 7, n.\u00a04. We assume that\nLimelight\u2019s customers do in fact \u201ctag\u201d within the patent\u2019s\nmeaning.2The panel noted that\nLimelight\u2019s contracts instruct its customers to tag the components\nthey wish to be stored on Limelight\u2019s CDN, but concluded that,\nbecause these contracts did not give Limelight control over its\ncustomers, the customers\u2019 tagging could not be attributed to\nLimelight. See629 F.\u00a03d, at 1321.3addressed contributory\ninfringement under \u00a7271(c), rather than inducement of infringement\nunder \u00a7271(b), but we see no basis to distinguish for these\npurposes between the two, which after all spring from common stock.\nSeev. , 563 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at\n8).4Section 271(f) now\nprohibits the exporter\u2019s conduct at issue in .",
