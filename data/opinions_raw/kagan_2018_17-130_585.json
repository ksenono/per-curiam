LUCIA, et\u00a0al., PETITIONERSv.SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSIONon writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the district of columbia circuit[June 21, 2018]Justice Kagan delivered the opinion of the\nCourt.The Appointments Clause of the Constitution lays\nout the permissible methods of appointing \u201cOfficers of the United\nStates,\u201d a class of government officials distinct from mere\nemployees. Art. II, \u00a72, cl. 2. This case requires us to decide\nwhether administrative law judges (ALJs) of the Securities and\nExchange Commission (SEC or Commission) qualify as such \u201cOfficers.\u201d\nIn keeping withFreytagv.Commissioner, 501\nU.\u00a0S. 868 (1991), we hold that they do.IThe SEC has statutory authority to enforce the\nnation\u2019s securities laws. One way it can do so is by instituting an\nadministrative proceeding against an alleged wrongdoer. By law, the\nCommission may itself preside over such a proceeding. See 17 CFR\n\u00a7201.110 (2017). But the Commission also may, and typically does,\ndelegate that task to an ALJ. Seeibid.; 15\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a778d\u20131(a). The SEC currently has five ALJs.\nOther staff members, rather than the Commission proper, selected\nthem all. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 295a\u2013297a.An ALJ assigned to hear an SEC enforcement\naction has extensive powers\u2014the \u201cauthority to do all things\nnecessary and appropriate to discharge his or her duties\u201d and\nensure a \u201cfair and orderly\u201d adversarial proceeding. \u00a7\u00a7201.111,\n200.14(a). Those powers \u201cinclude, but are not limited to,\u201d\nsupervising discovery; issuing, revoking, or modifying subpoenas;\ndeciding motions; ruling on the admissibility of evidence;\nadministering oaths; hearing and examining witnesses; generally\n\u201c[r]egulating the course of\u201d the proceeding and the \u201cconduct of the\nparties and their counsel\u201d; and imposing sanctions for\n\u201c[c]ontemptuous conduct\u201d or violations of procedural requirements.\n\u00a7\u00a7201.111, 201.180; see \u00a7\u00a7200.14(a), 201.230. As that list\nsuggests, an SEC ALJ exercises authority \u201ccomparable to\u201d that of a\nfederal district judge conducting a bench trial.Butzv.Economou, 438 U.\u00a0S. 478, 513 (1978).After a hearing ends, the ALJ issues an \u201cinitial\ndecision.\u201d \u00a7201.360(a)(1). That decision must set out \u201cfindings and\nconclusions\u201d about all \u201cmaterial issues of fact [and] law\u201d; it also\nmust include the \u201cappropriate order, sanction, relief, or denial\nthereof.\u201d \u00a7201.360(b). The Commission can then review the ALJ\u2019s\ndecision, either upon request orsua\u00a0sponte. See\n\u00a7201.360(d)(1). But if it opts against review, the Commission\n\u201cissue[s] an order that the [ALJ\u2019s] decision has become final.\u201d\n\u00a7201.360(d)(2). At that point, the initial decision is \u201cdeemed the\naction of the Commission.\u201d \u00a778d\u20131(c).This case began when the SEC instituted an\nadministrative proceeding against petitioner Raymond Lucia and his\ninvestment company. Lucia marketed a retirement savings strategy\ncalled \u201cBuckets of Money.\u201d In the SEC\u2019s view, Lucia used misleading\nslideshow presentations to deceive prospective clients. The SEC\ncharged Lucia under the Investment Advisers Act, \u00a780b\u20131et\nseq., and assigned ALJ Cameron Elliot to adjudicate the case.\nAfter nine days of testimony and argument, Judge Elliot issued an\ninitial decision concluding that Lucia had violated the Act and\nimposing sanctions, including civil penalties of $300,000 and a\nlifetime bar from the investment industry. In his decision, Judge\nElliot made factual findings about only one of the four ways the\nSEC thought Lucia\u2019s slideshow misled investors. The Commission thus\nremanded for factfinding on the other three claims, explaining that\nan ALJ\u2019s \u201cpersonal experience with the witnesses\u201d places him \u201cin\nthe best position to make findings of fact\u201d and \u201cresolve any\nconflicts in the evidence.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 241a. Judge\nElliot then made additional findings of deception and issued a\nrevised initial decision, with the same sanctions. Seeid.,at 118a.On appeal to the SEC, Lucia argued that the\nadministrative proceeding was invalid because Judge Elliot had not\nbeen constitutionally appointed. According to Lucia, the\nCommission\u2019s ALJs are \u201cOfficers of the United States\u201d and thus\nsubject to the Appointments Clause. Under that Clause, Lucia noted,\nonly the President, \u201cCourts of Law,\u201d or \u201cHeads of Departments\u201d can\nappoint \u201cOfficers.\u201d See Art. II, \u00a72, cl. 2. And none of those\nactors had made Judge Elliot an ALJ. To be sure, the Commission\nitself counts as a \u201cHead[\u00a0] of Department[\u00a0].\u201dIbid.; seeFree Enterprise Fundv.Public Company\nAccounting Oversight Bd., 561 U.\u00a0S. 477, 511\u2013513 (2010).\nBut the Commission had left the task of appointing ALJs, including\nJudge Elliot, to SEC staff members. Seesupra,at 1. As a\nresult, Lucia contended, Judge Elliot lacked constitutional\nauthority to do his job.The Commission rejected Lucia\u2019s argument. It\nheld that the SEC\u2019s ALJs are not \u201cOfficers of the United States.\u201d\nInstead, they are \u201cmere employees\u201d\u2014officials with lesser\nresponsibilities who fall outside the Appointments Clause\u2019s ambit.\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 87a. The Commission reasoned that its ALJs\ndo not \u201cexercise significant authority independent of [its own]\nsupervision.\u201dId.,at 88a. Because that is so (said the\nSEC), they need no special, high-level appointment. Seeid.,at 86a.Lucia\u2019s claim fared no better in the Court of\nAppeals for the D.\u00a0C. Circuit. A panel of that court seconded\nthe Commission\u2019s view that SEC ALJs are employees rather than\nofficers, and so are not subject to the Appointments Clause. See\n832 F.3d 277, 283\u2013289 (2016). Lucia then petitioned for rehearing\nen banc. The Court of Appeals granted that request and heard\nargument in the case. But the ten members of the en banc court\ndivided evenly, resulting in aper curiamorder denying\nLucia\u2019s claim. See 868 F.3d 1021 (2017). That decision conflicted\nwith one from the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. SeeBandimerev.SEC, 844 F.3d 1168, 1179 (2016).Lucia asked us to resolve the split by deciding\nwhether the Commission\u2019s ALJs are \u201cOfficers of the United States\nwithin the meaning of the Appointments Clause.\u201d Pet. for Cert. i.\nUp to that point, the Federal Government (as represented by the\nDepartment of Justice) had defended the Commission\u2019s position that\nSEC ALJs are employees, not officers. But in responding to Lucia\u2019s\npetition, the Government switched sides.[1] So when we granted the petition, 583 U.\u00a0S. ___\n(2018), we also appointed anamicus curiaeto defend the\njudgment below.[2] We now\nreverse.IIThe sole question here is whether the\nCommission\u2019s ALJs are \u201cOfficers of the United States\u201d or simply\nemployees of the Federal Government. The Appointments Clause\nprescribes the exclusive means of appointing \u201cOfficers.\u201d Only the\nPresident, a court of law, or a head of department can do so. See\nArt. II, \u00a72, cl. 2.[3] And as\nall parties agree, none of those actors appointed Judge Elliot\nbefore he heard Lucia\u2019s case; instead, SEC staff members gave him\nan ALJ slot. See Brief for Petitioners 15; Brief for United States\n38; Brief for Court-AppointedAmicus Cu- riae21. So if the\nCommission\u2019s ALJs are constitutional officers, Lucia raises a valid\nAppointments Clause claim. The only way to defeat his position is\nto show that those ALJs are not officers at all, but instead\nnon-officer employees\u2014part of the broad swath of \u201clesser\nfunctionaries\u201d in the Government\u2019s workforce.Buckleyv.Valeo, 424 U.\u00a0S. 1, 126, n. 162 (1976) (per\ncuriam). For if that is true, the Appointments Clause cares not\na whit about who named them. SeeUnited Statesv.Germaine, 99 U.\u00a0S. 508, 510 (1879).Two decisions set out this Court\u2019s basic\nframework for distinguishing between officers and employees.Germaineheld that \u201ccivil surgeons\u201d (doctors hired to\nperform various physical exams) were mere employees because their\nduties were \u201coccasional or temporary\u201d rather than \u201ccontinuing and\npermanent.\u201dId.,at 511\u2013512. Stressing \u201cideas of tenure\n[and] duration,\u201d the Court there made clear that an individual must\noccupy a \u201ccontinuing\u201d position established by law to qualify as an\nofficer.Id.,at 511.Buckleythen set out another\nrequirement, central to this case. It determined that members of a\nfederal commission were officers only after finding that they\n\u201cexercis[ed] significant authority pursuant to the laws of the\nUnited States.\u201d 424 U.\u00a0S., at 126. The inquiry thus focused on\nthe extent of power an individual wields in carrying out his\nassigned functions.Both theamicusand the Government urge\nus to elaborate onBuckley\u2019s \u201csignificant authority\u201d test,\nbut another of our precedents makes that project unnecessary. The\nstandard is no doubt framed in general terms, tempting advocates to\nadd whatever glosses best suit their arguments. See Brief forAmicus Curiae14 (contending that an individual wields\n\u201csignificant authority\u201d when he has \u201c(i) the power to bind the\ngovernment or private parties (ii) in her own name rather than in\nthe name of a superior officer\u201d); Reply Brief for United States 2\n(countering that an individual wields that authority when he has\n\u201cthe power to bind the government or third parties on significant\nmatters\u201d or to undertake other \u201cimportant and distinctively\nsovereign functions\u201d). And maybe one day we will see a need to\nrefine or enhance the testBuckleyset out so concisely. But\nthat day is not this one, because inFreytagv.Commissioner, 501 U.\u00a0S. 868 (1991), we applied the\nunadorned \u201csignificant authority\u201d test to adjudicative officials\nwho are near-carbon copies of the Commission\u2019s ALJs. As we now\nexplain, our analysis there (sans any more detailed legal criteria)\nnecessarily decides this case.The officials at issue inFreytagwere\nthe \u201cspecial trial judges\u201d (STJs) of the United States Tax Court.\nThe authority of those judges depended on the significance of the\ntax dispute before them. In \u201ccomparatively narrow and minor\nmatters,\u201d they could both hear and definitively resolve a case for\nthe Tax Court.Id., at 873. In more major matters, they\ncould preside over the hearing, but could not issue the final\ndecision; instead, they were to \u201cprepare proposed findings and an\nopinion\u201d for a regular Tax Court judge to consider.Ibid.The proceeding challenged inFreytagwas a major one,\ninvolving $1.5 billion in alleged tax deficiencies. Seeid.,at 871, n.\u00a01. After conducting a 14-week trial, the STJ\ndrafted a proposed decision in favor of the Government. A regular\njudge then adopted the STJ\u2019s work as the opinion of the Tax Court.\nSeeid.,at 872. The losing parties argued on appeal that\nthe STJ was not constitutionally appointed.This Court held that the Tax Court\u2019s STJs are\nofficers, not mere employees. CitingGermaine, the Court\nfirst found that STJs hold a continuing office established by law.\nSee 501 U.\u00a0S., at 881. They serve on an ongoing, rather than a\n\u201ctemporary [or] episodic[,] basis\u201d; and their \u201cduties, salary, and\nmeans of appointment\u201d are all specified in the Tax Code.Ibid.The Court then considered, asBuckleydemands,\nthe \u201csignificance\u201d of the \u201cauthority\u201d STJs wield. 501 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 881. In addressing that issue, the Government had argued that\nSTJs are employees, rather than officers, in all cases (like the\none at issue) in which they could not \u201center a final decision.\u201dIbid.But the Court thought the Government\u2019s focus on\nfinality \u201cignore[d] the significance of the duties and discretion\nthat [STJs] possess.\u201dIbid.Describing the responsibilities\ninvolved in presiding over adversarial hearings, the Court said:\nSTJs \u201ctake testimony, conduct trials, rule on the admissibility of\nevidence, and have the power to enforce compliance with discovery\norders.\u201dId.,at 881\u2013882. And the Court observed that \u201c[i]n\nthe course of carrying out these important functions, the [STJs]\nexercise significant discretion.\u201dId.,at 882. That fact\nmeant they were offi- cers, even when their decisions were not\nfinal.[4]Freytagsays everything necessary to\ndecide this case. To begin, the Commission\u2019s ALJs, like the Tax\nCourt\u2019s STJs, hold a continuing office established by law. Seeid., at 881. Indeed, everyone here\u2014Lucia, the Government,\nand theamicus\u2014agrees on that point. See Brief for\nPetitioners 21; Brief for United States 17\u201318, n. 3; Brief forAmicus Curiae22, n. 7. Far from serving temporarily or\nepisodically, SEC ALJs \u201creceive[\u00a0] a career appointment.\u201d 5\nCFR \u00a7930.204(a) (2018). And that appointment is to a position\ncreated by statute, down to its \u201cduties, salary, and means of\nappointment.\u201dFreytag, 501 U.\u00a0S., at 881; see 5\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a7556\u2013557, 5372, 3105.Still more, the Commission\u2019s ALJs exercise the\nsame \u201csignificant discretion\u201d when carrying out the same \u201cimportant\nfunctions\u201d as STJs do.Freytag, 501 U.\u00a0S., at 882. Both\nsets of officials have all the authority needed to ensure fair and\norderly adversarial hearings\u2014indeed, nearly all the tools of\nfederal trial judges. SeeButz, 438 U.\u00a0S., at 513;supra,at 2. Consider in order the four specific (if\noverlapping) powersFreytagmentioned. First, the\nCommission\u2019s ALJs (like the Tax Court\u2019s STJs) \u201ctake testimony.\u201d 501\nU.\u00a0S., at 881. More precisely, they \u201c[r]eceiv[e] evidence\u201d and\n\u201c[e]xamine witnesses\u201d at hearings, and may also take pre-hearing\ndepositions. 17 CFR \u00a7\u00a7201.111(c), 200.14(a)(4); see 5\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7556(c)(4). Second, the ALJs (like STJs)\n\u201cconduct trials.\u201d 501 U.\u00a0S., at 882. As detailed earlier, they\nadminister oaths, rule on motions, and generally \u201cregulat[e] the\ncourse of\u201d a hearing, as well as the conduct of parties and\ncounsel. \u00a7201.111; see \u00a7\u00a7200.14(a)(1), (a)(7);supra,at 2.\nThird, the ALJs (like STJs) \u201crule on the admissibility of\nevidence.\u201d 501 U.\u00a0S., at 882; see \u00a7201.111(c). They thus\ncritically shape the administrative record (as they also do when\nissuing document subpoenas). See \u00a7201.111(b). And fourth, the ALJs\n(like STJs) \u201chave the power to enforce compliance with discovery\norders.\u201d 501 U.\u00a0S., at 882. In particular, they may punish all\n\u201c[c]ontemptuous conduct,\u201d including violations of those orders, by\nmeans as severe as excluding the offender from the hearing. See\n\u00a7201.180(a)(1). So point for point\u2014straight fromFreytag\u2019s\nlist\u2014the Commission\u2019s ALJs have equivalent duties and powers as\nSTJs in conducting adversarial inquiries.And at the close of those proceedings, ALJs\nissue decisions much like that inFreytag\u2014except with\npotentially more independent effect. As theFreytagCourt\nrecounted, STJs \u201cprepare proposed findings and an opinion\u201d\nadjudicating charges and assessing tax liabilities. 501 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 873; seesupra,at 7. Similarly, the Commission\u2019s ALJs\nissue decisions containing factual findings, legal conclusions, and\nappropriate remedies. See \u00a7201.360(b);supra,at 2. And what\nhappens next reveals that the ALJ can play the more autonomous\nrole. In a major case likeFreytag, a regular Tax Court\njudge must always review an STJ\u2019s opinion. And that opinion counts\nfor nothing unless the regular judge adopts it as his own. See 501\nU.\u00a0S., at 873. By contrast, the SEC can decide against\nreviewing an ALJ decision at all. And when the SEC declines review\n(and issues an order saying so), the ALJ\u2019s decision itself \u201cbecomes\nfinal\u201d and is \u201cdeemed the action of the Commission.\u201d\n\u00a7201.360(d)(2); 15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a778d\u20131(c); seesupra,at 2. That last-word capacity makes this ana\u00a0fortioricase: If the Tax Court\u2019s STJs are officers, asFreytagheld,\nthen the Commission\u2019s ALJs must be too.Theamicusoffers up two distinctions to\nsupport the opposite conclusion. His main argument relates to \u201cthe\npower to enforce compliance with discovery orders\u201d\u2014the fourth ofFreytag\u2019s listed functions. 501 U.\u00a0S., at 882. The Tax\nCourt\u2019s STJs, he states, had that power \u201cbecause they had authority\nto punish contempt\u201d (including discovery violations) through fines\nor imprisonment. Brief forAmicus Curiae37; seeid.,at 37, n.\u00a010 (citing 26 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a77456(c)). By\ncontrast, he observes, the Commission\u2019s ALJs have less capacious\npower to sanction misconduct. Theamicus\u2019s secondary\ndistinction involves how the Tax Court and Commission,\nrespectively, review the factfinding of STJs and ALJs. The Tax\nCourt\u2019s rules state that an STJ\u2019s findings of fact \u201cshall be\npresumed\u201d correct. Tax Court Rule 183(d). In comparison, theamicusnotes, the SEC\u2019s regulations include no such\ndeferential standard. See Brief forAmicus Curiae10, 38,\nn.\u00a011.But those distinctions make no difference for\nofficer status. To start with theamicus\u2019s primary point,Freytagreferenced only the general \u201cpower to enforce\ncompliance with discovery orders,\u201d not any particular method of\ndoing so. 501 U.\u00a0S., at 882. True enough, the power to toss\nmalefactors in jail is an especially muscular means of\nenforcement\u2014the nuclear option of compliance tools. But just as\narmies can often enforce their will through conventional weapons,\nso too can administrative judges. As noted earlier, the\nCommission\u2019s ALJs can respond to discovery violations and other\ncontemptuous conduct by excluding the wrongdoer (whether party or\nlawyer) from the proceedings\u2014a powerful disincentive to resist a\ncourt order. See \u00a7201.180(a)(1)(i);supra,at 9. Similarly,\nif the offender is an attorney, the ALJ can \u201c[s]ummarily suspend\u201d\nhim from representing his client\u2014not something the typical lawyer\nwants to invite. \u00a7201.180(a)(1)(ii). And finally, a judge who will,\nin the end, issue an opinion complete with factual findings, legal\nconclusions, and sanctions has substantial informal power to ensure\nthe parties stay in line. Contrary to theamicus\u2019s view, all\nthat is enough to satisfyFreytag\u2019s fourth item (even\nsupposing, which we do not decide, that each of those items is\nnecessary for someone conducting adversarial hearings to count as\nan officer).And theamicus\u2019s standard-of-review\ndistinction fares just as badly. TheFreytagCourt never\nsuggested that the deference given to STJs\u2019 factual findings\nmattered to its Appointments Clause analysis. Indeed, the relevant\npart ofFreytagdid not so much as mention the subject (even\nthough it came up at oral argument, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 33\u201341).\nAnd anyway, the Commission often accords a similar deference to its\nALJs, even if not by regulation. The Commission has repeatedly\nstated, as it did below, that its ALJs are in the \u201cbest position to\nmake findings of fact\u201d and \u201cresolve any conflicts in the evidence.\u201d\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 241a (quotingIn\u00a0re Nasdaq Stock\nMarket, LLC, SEC Release No. 57741 (Apr. 30, 2008)). (That was\nwhy the SEC insisted that Judge Elliot make factual findings on all\nfour allegations of Lucia\u2019s deception. Seesupra,at 3.) And\nwhen factfinding derives from credibility judgments, as it\nfrequently does, acceptance is near-automatic. Recognizing ALJs\u2019\n\u201cpersonal experience with the witnesses,\u201d the Commission adopts\ntheir \u201ccredibility finding[s] absent overwhelming evidence to the\ncontrary.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 241a;In\u00a0re Clawson,\nSEC Release No. 48143 (July 9, 2003). That practice erases the\nconstitutional line theamicusproposes to draw.The only issue left is remedial. For all the\nreasons we have given, and all thoseFreytaggave before,\nthe Commission\u2019s ALJs are \u201cOfficers of the United States,\u201d subject\nto the Appointments Clause. And as noted earlier, Judge Elliot\nheard and decided Lucia\u2019s case without the kind of appointment the\nClause requires. Seesupra,at 5. This Court has held that\n\u201cone who makes a timely challenge to the constitutional validity of\nthe appointment of an officer who adjudicates his case\u201d is entitled\nto relief.Ryderv.United States, 515 U.\u00a0S.\n177, 182\u2013183 (1995). Lucia made just such a timely challenge: He\ncontested the validity of Judge Elliot\u2019s appointment before the\nCommission, and continued pressing that claim in the Court of\nAppeals and this Court. So what relief follows? This Court has also\nheld that the \u201cappropriate\u201d remedy for an adjudication tainted with\nan appointments violation is a new \u201chearing before a properly\nappointed\u201d official.Id., at 183, 188. And we add today one\nthing more. That official cannot be Judge Elliot, even if he has by\nnow received (or receives sometime in the future) a constitutional\nappointment. Judge Elliot has already both heard Lucia\u2019s case and\nissued an initial decision on the merits. He cannot be expected to\nconsider the matter as though he had not adjudicated it\nbefore.[5] To cure the\nconstitutional error, another ALJ (or the Commission itself) must\nhold the new hearing to which Lucia is entitled.[6]We accordingly reverse the judgment of the Court\nof Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings consistent\nwith this opinion.It is so ordered.Notes1In the same\ncertiorari-stage brief, the Government asked us to add a second\nquestion presented: whether the statutory restrictions on removing\nthe Commission\u2019s ALJs are constitutional. See Brief in Response 21.\nWhen we granted certiorari, we chose not to take that step. See 583\nU.\u00a0S. ___ (2018). The Government\u2019s merits brief now asks us\nagain to address the removal issue. See Brief for United States\n39\u201355. We once more decline. No court has addressed that question,\nand we ordinarily await \u201cthorough lower court opinions to guide our\nanalysis of the merits.\u201dZivotofskyv.Clinton, 566\nU.\u00a0S. 189, 201 (2012).2We appointed Anton\nMetlitsky to brief and argue the case, 583 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2018),\nand he has ably discharged his responsibilities.3That statement elides a\ndistinction, not at issue here, between \u201cprincipal\u201d and \u201cinferior\u201d\nofficers. SeeEdmondv.United States, 520 U.\u00a0S.\n651, 659\u2013660 (1997). Only the President, with the advice and\nconsent of the Senate, can appoint a principal officer; but\nCongress (instead of relying on that method) may authorize the\nPresident alone, a court, or a department head to appoint an\ninferior officer. Seeibid. Both the Government and Lucia\nview the SEC\u2019s ALJs as inferior officers and acknowledge that the\nCommission, as a head of department, can constitutionally appoint\nthem. See Brief for United States 38; Brief for Petitioners\n50\u201351.4The Court also provided\nan alternative basis for viewing the STJs as officers. \u201cEven if the\nduties of [STJs in major cases] were not as significant as we\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. have found them,\u201d we stated, \u201cour conclusion would\nbe unchanged.\u201dFreytag, 501 U.\u00a0S., at 882. That was\nbecause the Government had conceded that in minor matters, where\nSTJs could enter final decisions, they had enough \u201cindependent\nauthority\u201d to count as officers.Ibid.And we thought it\nmade no sense to classify the STJs as officers for some cases and\nemployees for others. Seeibid.Justice Sotomayor relies on\nthat back-up rationale in trying to reconcileFreytagwith\nher view that \u201ca prerequisite to officer status is the authority\u201d\nto issue at least some \u201cfinal decisions.\u201dPost, at 5\n(dissenting opinion). ButFreytaghas two parts, and its\nprimary analysis explicitly rejects Justice Sotomayor\u2019s theory that\nfinal decisionmaking authority is asine qua nonof officer\nstatus. See 501 U.\u00a0S., at 881\u2013882. As she acknowledges, she\nmust expunge that reasoning to make her reading work. Seepost,at 5 (\u201cThat part of the opinion[ ] was unnecessary to\nthe result\u201d).5Justice Breyer disagrees\nwith our decision to wrest further proceedings from Judge Elliot,\narguing that \u201c[f]or him to preside once again would not violate the\nstructural purposes [of] the Appointments Clause.\u201dPost, at\n13 (opinion concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part).\nBut our Appointments Clause remedies are designed not only to\nadvance those purposes directly, but also to create\n\u201c[\u00a0]incentive[s] to raise Appointments Clause challenges.\u201dRyderv.United States, 515 U.\u00a0S. 177, 183\n(1995). We best accomplish that goal by providing a successful\nlitigant with a hearing before a new judge. That is especially so\nbecause (as Justice Breyer points out) the old judge would have no\nreason to think he did anything wrong on the merits, seepost, at 13\u2014and so could be expected to reach all the same\njudgments. But we do not hold that a new officer is required for\nevery Appointments Clause violation. As Justice Breyer suggests, we\ncan give that remedy here because other ALJs (and the Commission)\nare available to hear this case on remand. Seeibid.If\ninstead the Appointments Clause problem is with the Commission\nitself, so that there is no substitute decisionmaker, the rule of\nnecessity would presumably kick in and allow the Commission to do\nthe rehearing. SeeFTCv.Cement Institute, 333\nU.\u00a0S. 683, 700\u2013703 (1948); 3 K. Davis, Administrative Law\nTreatise \u00a719.9 (2d ed. 1980).6While this case was on\njudicial review, the SEC issued an order \u201cratif[ying]\u201d the prior\nappointments of its ALJs. Order (Nov. 30, 2017), online at\nhttps://www.sec.gov/litigation/opinions/2017/33-10440.pdf (as last\nvisited June 18, 2018). Lucia argues that the order is invalid. See\nBrief for Petitioners 50\u201356. We see no reason to address that\nissue. The Commission has not suggested that it intends to assign\nLucia\u2019s case on remand to an ALJ whose claim to authority rests on\nthe ratification order. The SEC may decide to conduct Lucia\u2019s\nrehearing itself. Or it may assign the hearing to an ALJ who has\nreceived a constitutional appointment independent of the\nratification.",
