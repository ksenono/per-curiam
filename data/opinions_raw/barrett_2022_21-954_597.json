BIDEN, JR., PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED\nSTATES, et\u00a0al., PETITIONERSv.TEXAS, et\u00a0al.on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the fifth circuit[June 30, 2022]Justice Barrett, with whom Justice Thomas,\nJustice Alito, and Justice Gorsuch join as to all but the first\nsentence, dissenting.I agree with the Court\u2019s analysis of the\nmerits\u2014but not with its decision to reach them. The lower courts in\nthis case concluded that 8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71252(f\u00a0)(1), a\nprovision of the Immigration and Nationality Act sharply limiting\nfederal courts\u2019 \u201cjurisdiction or authority to enjoin or restrain\nthe operation of\u00a0\u201d certain immigration laws, did not present a\njurisdictional bar. Just two weeks ago, however, we repudiated\ntheir reasoning inGarlandv.Aleman Gonzalez, 596\nU.\u00a0S. ___ (2022). Because we are a court of review and not\nfirst view, I would vacate and remand for the lower courts to\nreconsider their assertion of jurisdiction in light ofAleman\nGonzalez.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*Section 1252(f\u00a0)(1) provides that \u201cno\ncourt (other than the Supreme Court) shall have jurisdiction or\nauthority to enjoin or restrain the operation of\u00a0\u201d specified\nimmigration provisions, except as applied to \u201can individual alien\nagainst whom proceedings under [those provisions] have been\ninitiated.\u201d Some lower courts have narrowly interpreted this\nprovision, holding that it does not bar relief that a plaintiff\nframes as \u201crequir[ing]\u201d (rather than preventing) the Government\u2019s\nenforcement of or compliance with the covered immigration laws.E.g., 20 F.\u00a04th 928, 1004 (CA5 2021). In this case,\nthat was the only ground pressed by respondents below and relied on\nby the lower courts to hold that \u00a71252(f\u00a0)(1) did not \u201cba[r]\njurisdiction.\u201dIbid.; see App. to Pet. for Cert. 184a; Brief\nfor Appellees in No. 21\u201310806 (CA5), pp.\u00a040\u201341. But we just\nrejected this interpretation inAleman Gonzalez. There, we\nheld that \u00a71252(f\u00a0)(1) deprives lower courts of \u201cjurisdiction\nto entertain\u201d requests for \u201cinjunctions that order federal\nofficials to take or to refrain from taking actions to enforce,\nimplement, or otherwise carry out the specified statutory\nprovisions\u201d (subject to an exception, indisputably inapplicable to\nthis case, for a suit by an individual noncitizen in proceedings\nunder those provisions). 596 U.\u00a0S., at ___, ___ (slip op., at\n1, 5).In the normal course, we would vacate and remand\nthis case for further proceedings in light ofAleman\nGonzalez. Instead, the Court plows ahead to break new\njurisdictional ground. Acting on a compressed timeline, it embraces\na theory of \u00a71252(f\u00a0)(1) that\u2014so far as I can tell\u2014no court of\nappeals has ever adopted: that \u00a71252(f\u00a0)(1) limits only the\nlower courts\u2019 remedial authority, not their subject-matter\njurisdiction. The only court of appeals to have addressed this\ntheory rejected it.Mirandav.Garland, 34\nF.\u00a04th 338, 354\u2013356 (CA4 2022). Still, the Court is confident\nenough to proceed based on short, barely adversarial supplemental\nbriefs. (The United States\u2019 original brief devoted only a\nconclusory footnote to the jurisdictional question, and Texas and\nMissouri did not respond.) And these supplemental briefs are\nparticularly unhelpful because, having been submitted prior to our\ndecision inAleman Gonzalez, they could not address that\ndecision\u2019s significance for this case. In fact, they devoted a\nconsiderable portion of their allotted length to the issue thatAleman Gonzalezsubsequently resolved.This would all matter less if the jurisdictional\nquestion were easy or unimportant\u2014but it is neither. The Court\u2019s\nopinion papers over difficult issues, as I will discuss below, and\nits jurisdictional holding is likely to affect many cases. See,e.g.,Texasv.Biden, ___ F.\u00a0Supp. 3d\n___, ___, 2022 WL 658579, *14 (ND Tex., Mar. 4, 2022)\n(\u00a71252(f\u00a0)(1) does not bar Texas\u2019 claim that the Federal\nGovernment is wrongly refusing to detain noncitizens to determine\nif they have COVID\u201319); Defendants\u2019 Opposition to Plaintiffs\u2019\nMotion for Temporary Restraining Order 8\u20139 inArizonav.CDC, Civ. No. 6:22\u2013cv\u201300885 (WD La., Apr. 22, 2022) (arguing\nthat \u00a71252(f\u00a0)(1) prohibits a district court from constraining\nthe Federal Government\u2019s removal discretion in litigation\nchallenging termination of Title 42 order). We should not short\ncircuit the ordinary process.I have several doubts about the Court\u2019s analysis\nof \u00a71252(f\u00a0)(1). To begin with, the Court assumes that we face\nan either/or choice between subject-matter jurisdiction and\nremedial authority, with the former being only about a court\u2019s\nauthority to decide merits questions and the latter being only\nabout the relief a court can grant.Ante, at 9. This\ndichotomy makes the Court\u2019s job easier, because it can use the\nobvious point that \u00a71252(f\u00a0)(1) strips lower courts of\nremedial authority to establish that \u00a71252(f\u00a0)(1) doesnotstrip them of subject-matter jurisdiction. But why is it\na binary choice? I would think that Congress is free to link a\ncourt\u2019s subject-matter jurisdiction to its remedial authority. That\nis not so different from an amount-in-controversy requirement,\nwhich conditions a district court\u2019s ability to address the merits\non the relief that the plaintiff seeks. See,e.g., 28\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71332 (district courts have subject-matter\njurisdiction over diversity cases only when the amount in\ncontroversy exceeds $75,000). And the redressability requirement of\nArticle III itself establishes a tie between jurisdiction and\nremedies, because a court\u2019s inability to order effective relief\ndeprives it of jurisdiction to decide the merits of a question\notherwise within its competence. See,e.g.,Californiav.Texas, 593 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2021)\n(slip op., at 7) (redressability \u201cconsider[s] the relationship\nbetween \u2018the judicial relief requested\u2019 and the \u2018injury\u2019\nsuffered\u201d);Los Angelesv.Lyons,461 U.S.\n95, 105\u2013107 (1983) (failure to allege sufficient likelihood of\nfuture injury deprives a federal court of Article III \u201cjurisdiction\nto entertain [the count] of the complaint\u201d seeking injunctive\nrelief\u00a0).So it seems to me quite possible that\n\u00a71252(f\u00a0)(1) withdraws subject-matter jurisdiction over cases\nseeking certain remedies. Indeed, while the Government has a theory\nfor why the Court can reach the merits in this case, it\ncharacterizes \u00a71252(f\u00a0)(1) as imposing \u201cjurisdictional\nlimitations\u201d that \u201cspeak to \u2018a court\u2019spower\u2019\u00a0\u201d and\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018can never be forfeited or waived.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Supplemental\nBrief for Petitioners 19\u201320; see alsoMiranda, 34\nF.\u00a04th, at 354 (concluding that \u201c\u00a71252(f\u00a0)(1) is a\njurisdiction-stripping statute\u201d that cannot be waived). If there is\na reason to treat limitations on subject-matter jurisdiction and\nlimitations on remedial authority as mutually exclusive\u2014either in\ngeneral or in this statutory scheme\u2014the Court does not explain\nit.The Court breezes past other questions too. Most\nnotably, it gives surprisingly little attention to a phrase on\nwhich it places significant weight: \u00a71252(f\u00a0)(1)\u2019s\nparenthetical exempting \u201cthe Supreme Court\u201d from its general bar on\n\u201cjurisdiction or authority.\u201d The parties hardly discuss this\nparenthetical, which does not appear to have an analogue elsewhere\nin the United States Code. The Court, however, takes the phrase as\nconclusive evidence that \u00a71252(f\u00a0)(1) does not deprive\ndistrict courts of subject- matter jurisdiction over\n\u201cnon-individual claims under [the covered provisions],\u201d because if\nit did, \u201cno such claims could ever arrive at this Court, rendering\nthe provision\u2019s specific carveout for Supreme Court injunctive\nrelief nugatory.\u201dAnte, at 10.While this interpretation has some surface\nappeal, the Court does not explain how it would work. Does it mean\nthat the restriction on remedial authority is subject to waiver or\nforfeiture, so that a lower court can sometimes properly enter\nnon-individual injunctive relief that this Court can then review?\nThat a district court has the authority to enter some kinds of\nnon-individual relief (for example, a classwide declaratory\njudgment) and that this Court can enter different relief (for\nexample, a classwide injunction) on review of that judgment? Or\nthat this Court can enter an injunction on appeal if the district\ncourtcouldhave entered at least one form of relief, even\nif it actually entered only relief that exceeded its\nauthority?[1]* Or perhaps the\nparenthetical serves the very different purpose of clarifying that\n\u00a71252(f\u00a0)(1) does not disturb any pre-existing authority this\nCourt has under the All Writs Act or other sources. These are\ndifficult questions, yet the Court does not address any of\nthem.Indeed, the Court explicitly choosesnotto opine on some of the issues that might help explain the\nparenthetical\u2019s unusual reservation. Seeante, at 12,\nn.\u00a04. For example, the Court declines to decide whether the\nbar in \u00a71252(f\u00a0)(1) is subject to forfeiture, even though that\nis a defining feature of nonjurisdictional rules. See,e.g.,Hamerv.Neighborhood Housing Servs. of Chicago, 583\nU.\u00a0S. ___, ___\u2013___ (2017) (slip op., at 2\u20133). It reserves the\nquestion whether \u00a71252(f\u00a0)(1) bars declaratory relief, an\nissue on which there are conflicting views. CompareAlliv.Decker, 650 F.3d 1007, 1013 (CA3 2011) (it does not bar\ndeclaratory relief\u00a0), withid., at 1019\u20131021 (Fuentes,\nJ., dissenting) (it does), withHamamav.Adducci,\n912 F.3d 869, 880, n.\u00a08 (CA6 2018) (it depends). And it avoids\na position on whether \u00a71252(f\u00a0)(1) prevents a lower court from\nvacating or setting aside an agency action under the Administrative\nProcedure Act. See 5 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7706(2). Not that I fault\nthe Court for holding back. Quite the contrary: The questions\nsurrounding \u00a71252(f\u00a0)(1) are complex and deserve more\nattention than we can give them in this posture.As a final touch, the Court asserts that our\nprecedent has already charted this course.Ante, at 11\u201312.\nBut the Court cannot muster much on that front. It cites a passing\nstatement rejecting an inapposite argument that \u00a71252(f\u00a0)(1)\nis a jurisdictionalgrant, seeRenov.American-Arab Anti- Discrimination Comm.,525 U.S.\n471, 481 (1999), a brief discussion from a plurality opinion in\na case where the \u00a71252(f\u00a0)(1) issue had not been briefed or\nargued by the parties in this Court, seeNielsenv.Preap, 586 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___\u2013___ (2019) (slip op., at\n8\u20139), and a dissent, seeJenningsv.Rodriguez, 583\nU.\u00a0S ___, ___ (2018) (opinion of Breyer, J.) (slip op., at\n31). None provides a clear roadmap for this case.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*Given all this, I would tread more carefully.\nWe should let the lower courts be the first to address the\nsubstantial antecedent questions that \u00a71252(f\u00a0)(1) presents in\nlight of our hot-off-the-presses decision inAleman\nGonzalez. I respectfully dissent.Notes1*For instance, in this case,\nthe States sought declaratory relief, injunctive relief, and\nvacatur of the Government\u2019s termination of the Migrant Protection\nProtocols, but the District Court expressly entered only the latter\ntwo. If the District Court could have issued a declaratory\njudgment, perhaps this Court could exercise appellate jurisdiction\neven if the District Court lacked authority to issue an injunction\nor vacatur. The Court suggests that this happened inNielsenv.Preap, 586 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2019), in which, it says, the\nDistrict Court also awarded only injunctive relief.Ante, at\n11. But the issue is more complicated than the Court lets on.Preapinvolved consolidated cases. In the first, the\nplaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, but the\nDistrict Court entered only the latter. SeePreapv.Johnson, 303 F.R.D. 566, 587 (ND Cal. 2014). In the second,\nhowever, the District Court entered \u201conly [a] declaratory ruling,\u201d\nwith no accompanying injunction.Khouryv.Asher, 3\nF.\u00a0Supp. 3d 877, 892 (WD Wash. 2014). So unlike today\u2019s case,Preapdid not involve only a hypothetical declaratory\njudgment.",
