If immigration officials\ndeny that motion, a federal court of appeals has jurisdiction to\nconsider a petition to review their decision. SeeKucanav.Holder, 558 U.\u00a0S. 233, 242, 253 (2010) .\nNotwithstanding that rule, the court below declined to take\njurisdiction over such an appeal because the motion to reopen had\nbeen denied as untimely. We hold that was error.IThe Immigration and Nationality Act (INA),\n66Stat. 163, as amended, 8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71101et\u00a0seq., and its implementing regulations set out the\nprocess for removing aliens from the country. An immigration judge\n(IJ) conducts the initial proceedings; if he orders removal, the\nalien has the opportunity to appeal that decision tothe Board of\nImmigration Appeals (BIA or Board). \u00a7\u00a71229a(a)(1), (c)(5). \u201c[E]very\nalien ordered removed\u201d also\u201chas a right to file one motion\u201d with the IJ\nor Boardto \u201creopen his or her removal proceedings.\u201dDadav.Mukasey, 554 U.\u00a0S. 1 \u20135 (2008); see \u00a71229a(c)(7)(A).\nSubject to exceptions not relevant here, that motion to reopen\n\u201cshall be filed within 90 days\u201d of the final removal order.\n\u00a71229a(c)(7)(C)(i). Finally, the BIA\u2019s regulations provide that,\nseparate and apart from acting on the alien\u2019s motion, the BIA may\nreopen removal proceedings \u201con its own motion\u201d\u2014or, in Latin,sua\u00a0sponte\u2014at any time. 8 CFR \u00a71003.2(a) (2015).Petitioner Noel Reyes Mata is a Mexican citizen\nwho entered the United States unlawfully almost 15 years ago. In\n2010, he was convicted of assault under the Texas Penal Code. The\nfederal Department of Homeland Secu-rity (DHS) immediately\ninitiated removal proceedings against him, and in August 2011 an IJ\nordered him removed. See App. 6\u201313. Mata\u2019s lawyer then filed a\nnotice of appeal with the BIA, indicating that he would soon submit\na written brief stating grounds for reversing the IJ\u2019s decision.\nBut the attorney never filed the brief, and the BIA dismissed the\nappeal in September 2012. See App. 4\u20135.More than a hundred days later, Mata (by then\nrepresented by new counsel) filed a motion with the Board to reopen\nhis case. DHS opposed the motion, arguing in part that Mata had\nfailed to file it, as the INA requires, within 90 days of the\nBoard\u2019s decision. Mata responded that the motion was \u201cnot time\nbarred\u201d because his first lawyer\u2019s \u201cineffective assistance\u201d counted\nas an \u201cexceptional circumstance[\u00a0]\u201d excusing his lateness.\nCertified Administrative Record in No. 13\u201360253 (CA5, Aug. 2,\n2013), p. 69. In addressing those arguments, the Board reaffirmed\nprior decisions holding that it had authority to equitably toll the\n90-day period in certain cases involving ineffective\nrepresentation. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 7; see also,e.g.,\nIn\u00a0re Santa Celenia Diaz, 2009 WL 2981747 (BIA, Aug. 21,\n2009). But the Board went on to determine that Mata was not\nentitled to equitable tolling because he could not show prejudice\nfrom his attorney\u2019s deficient performance; accordingly, the Board\nfound Mata\u2019s motion untimely. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 7\u20138. And\nin closing, the Board decided as well that Mata\u2019s case was not one\n\u201cthat would warrant reopening as an exercise of\u201d itssua\nsponteauthority.Id.,at 9 (stating that \u201cthe power to\nreopen on our own motion is not meant to be used as a general cure\nfor filing defects\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).Mata petitioned the Court of Appeals for the\nFifth Circuit to review the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion to reopen,\narguing that he was entitled to equitable tolling. The Fifth\nCircuit, however, declined to \u201caddress the meritsof Mata\u2019s\nequitable-tolling .\u00a0.\u00a0. claim[\u00a0].\u201dReyes Matav.Holder, 558 Fed. Appx. 366, 367 (2014) (per\ncuriam). It stated instead that \u201c[i]n this circuit, an alien\u2019s\nrequest [to the BIA] for equitable tolling on the basis of\nineffective assistance of counsel is construed as an invitation for\nthe BIA to exercise its discretion to reopen the removal proceedingsua sponte.\u201dIbid.And circuit precedent held that\ncourts have no jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s refusal to exercise\nitssua\u00a0spontepower to reopen cases. Seeibid.The Court of Appeals thus dismissed Mata\u2019s appeal for lack of\njurisdiction.Every other Circuit that reviews removal orders\nhas affirmed its jurisdiction to decide an appeal, like Mata\u2019s,\nthat seeks equitable tolling of the statutory time limit to file a\nmotion to reopen a removal proceeding.[1] We granted certiorari to resolve this conflict. 574\nU.\u00a0S. ___ (2015). And because the Federal Government agrees\nwith Mata that the Fifth Circuit had jurisdiction over his appeal,\nwe appointed anamicus curiaeto defend the judgment\nbelow.[2] We now reverse.IIAs we held inKucanav.Holder,\ncircuit courts have jurisdiction when an alien appeals from the\nBoard\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen a removal proceeding. See 558\nU.\u00a0S., at 242, 253. The INA, in combination with a statute\ncross-referenced there, gives the courts of appeals jurisdiction to\nreview \u201cfinal order[s] of removal.\u201d 8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a71252(a)(1); 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72342. That jurisdiction, as the\nINA expressly contemplates, encompasses review of decisions\nrefusingto reopen or reconsider such orders. See 8\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71252(b)(6) (\u201c[A]ny review sought of a motion to\nreopen or reconsider [a removal order] shall be consolidated with\nthe review of the [underlying] order\u201d). Indeed, as we explained inKucana, courts have reviewed those decisions for nearly a\nhundred years; and even as Congress curtailed other aspects of\ncourts\u2019 jurisdiction over BIA rulings, it left that authority in\nplace. See 558 U.\u00a0S., at242\u2013251.Nothing changes when the Board denies a motion\nto reopen because it is untimely\u2014nor when, in doing so, the Board\nrejects a request for equitable tolling. Under the INA, as under\nour century-old practice, the reason for the BIA\u2019s denial makes no\ndifference to the jurisdictional issue. Whether the BIA rejects the\nalien\u2019s motion to re-open because it comes too late or because it\nfalls short in some other respect, the courts have jurisdiction to\nreview that decision.Similarly, that jurisdiction remains unchanged\nif the Board, in addition to denying the alien\u2019s statutorily\nauthorized motion, states that it will not exercise its separatesua\u00a0sponteauthority to reopen the case. Seesupra,at 1\u20132. InKucana, we declined to decide\nwhether courts have jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s use of that\ndiscretionary power. See 558 U.\u00a0S., at 251, n.\u00a018. Courts\nof Appeals, including the Fifth Circuit, have held that they\ngenerally lack such authority. See,e.g., Enriquez-Alvaradov.Ashcroft, 371 F.\u00a03d 246, 249\u2013250 (CA5 2004);Tamenutv.Mukasey, 521 F.\u00a03d 1000, 1003\u20131004\n(CA8 2008) (en banc) (per curiam) (citing other decisions).\nAssumingarguendothat is right, it means only that judicial\nreview ends after the court has evaluated the Board\u2019s ruling on the\nalien\u2019s motion. That courts lack jurisdiction over one matter (thesua\u00a0spontedecision) does not affect their jurisdiction\nover another (the decision on the alien\u2019s request).It follows, as the night the day, that the Court\nof Appeals had jurisdiction over this case. Recall: As authorized\nby the INA, Mata filed a motion with the Board to reopen his\nremoval proceeding. The Board declined to grant Mata his proposed\nrelief, thus conferring jurisdiction on an appellate court underKucana. The Board did so for timeliness reasons, holding\nthat Mata had filed his motion after 90 days had elapsed and that\nhe was not entitled to equitable tolling. But as just explained,\nthe reason the Board gave makes no difference: Whenever the Board\ndenies an alien\u2019s statutory motion to reopen a removal case, courts\nhave jurisdiction to review its decision. In addition, the Board\ndetermined not to exercise itssua sponteauthority to\nreopen. But once again, that extra ruling does not matter. The\nCourt of Appeals did not lose jurisdiction over the Board\u2019s denial\nof Mata\u2019s motion just because the Board also declined to reopen his\ncasesua sponte.Nonetheless, the Fifth Circuit dismissed Mata\u2019s\nappeal for lack of jurisdiction. That decision, as described\nearlier, hinged on \u201cconstru[ing]\u201d Mata\u2019s motion as something it was\nnot: \u201can invitation for the BIA to exercise\u201d itssua\u00a0sponteauthority. 558 Fed. Appx., at 367;supra,at 3.Amicus\u2019s defense of that approach\ncentrally relies on a merits-based premise: that the INA forbids\nequitable tolling of the 90-day filing period in any case, no\nmatter how exceptional the circumstances. See Brief forAmicus\nCuriaeby Invitation of the Court 14\u201335. Given that is so,amicuscontinues, the court acted permissibly in\n\u201crecharacteriz[ing]\u201d Mata\u2019s pleadings.Id.,at 36. After\nall, courts often treat a request for \u201ccategorically unavailable\u201d\nrelief as instead \u201cseeking relief [that] may be available.\u201dId.,at 35, 38. And here (amicusconcludes) that\nmeant construing Mata\u2019s request for equitable tolling as a request\nforsua\u00a0spontereopening\u2014even though that caused the\nFifth Circuit to lose its jurisdiction.But that conclusion is wrong even on the\nassumption\u2014and it is only an assumption\u2014that its core premise about\nequitable tolling is true.[3]\nIf the INA precludes Mata from getting the relief he seeks, then\nthe right course on appeal is to take jurisdiction over the case,\nexplain why that is so, and affirm the BIA\u2019s decision not to\nreopen. The jurisdictional question (whether the court has power to\ndecide if tolling is proper) is of course distinct from the merits\nquestion (whether tolling is proper). SeeSteel Co.v.Citizens for Better Environment, 523 U.\u00a0S. 83, 89\n(1998) (\u201c[T]he absence of a valid .\u00a0.\u00a0. cause of action\ndoes not implicate subject-matter jurisdiction\u201d). The Fifth Circuit\nthus retains jurisdiction even if Mata\u2019s appeal lacks merit. And\nwhen a federal court has jurisdiction, it also has a \u201cvirtually\nunflagging obligation .\u00a0.\u00a0. to exercise\u201d that authority.Colorado River Water Conservation Dist.v.United\nStates, 424 U.\u00a0S. 800, 817 (1976) . Accordingly,the Court\nof Appeals should have asserted jurisdiction over Mata\u2019s appeal and\naddressed the equitable tolling question.Contrary toamicus\u2019s view, the practice\nof recharacterizing pleadings so as to offer the possibility of\nrelief cannot justify the Court of Appeals\u2019 alternative approach.\nTrue enough (and a good thing too) that courts sometimes construe\none kind of filing as another: If a litigant misbrands a motion,\nbut could get relief under a different label, a court will often\nmake the requisite change. See,e.g.,12 J. Moore, Moore\u2019s\nFederal Practice, \u00a759.11[4] (3 ed. 2015) (explaining how courts\ntreat untimely Rule 59 motions as Rule 60 motions because the\nlatter have no time limit). But that established practice does not\nentail sidestepping the judicial obligation to exercise\njurisdiction. And it results in identifying a route to relief, not\nin rendering relief impossible. That makes all the difference\nbetween a court\u2019s generously reading pleadings and a court\u2019s\nconstruing away adjudicative authority.And if, asamicusargues, that construal\nrests on an underlying merits decision\u2014that the INA precludes any\nequitable tolling\u2014then the Court of Appeals has effectively\ninsulated a circuit split from our review. Putting theFifth Circuit\nto the side, all appellate courts to have addressed the matter have\nheld that the Board may sometimes equitably toll the time limit for\nan alien\u2019s motion to reopen. See n.\u00a01,supra. Assuming\nthe Fifth Circuit thinks otherwise, that creates the kind of split\nof authority we typically think we need to resolve. See this\nCourt\u2019s Rule 10(a). But the Fifth Circuit\u2019s practice of\nrecharacterizing appeals like Mata\u2019s as challenges to the Board\u2019ssua\u00a0spontedecisions and then declining to exercise\njurisdiction over them prevents that split from coming to light. Of\ncourse, the Court of Appeals may reach whatever conclusion it\nthinks best as to the availability of equitable tolling; we express\nno opinion on that matter. See n. 3,supra. What the Fifth\nCircuit may not do is to wrap such a merits decision in\njurisdictional garb so that we cannot address a possible division\nbetween that court and every other.For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the\njudgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for further\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.Notes1See,e.g., Da Silva\nNevesv.Holder, 613 F.\u00a03d 30, 33 (CA1 2010)\n(per curiam) (exercising jurisdiction over such a petition);Iavorskiv.INS, 232 F. 3d 124, 129\u2013134 (CA2 2000)\n(same);Borgesv.Gonzales, 402 F. 3d 398, 406 (CA3\n2005) (same);Kuuskv.Holder, 732 F. 3d 302, 305\u2013306\n(CA4 2013) (same);Barryv.Mukasey, 524 F. 3d 721,\n724\u2013725 (CA6 2008) (same);Pervaizv.Gonzales, 405\nF. 3d 488, 490 (CA7 2005) (same);Hernandez-Moranv.Gonzales, 408 F. 3d 496, 499\u2013500 (CA8 2005) (same);Valerianov.Gonzales, 474 F. 3d 669, 673 (CA9 2007)\n(same);Rileyv.INS, 310 F. 3d 1253, 1257\u20131258 (CA10\n2002) (same);Avila-Santoyov.United States Atty.\nGen., 713 F. 3d 1357, 1359, 1362\u20131364 (CA11 2013) (per\ncuriam) (same). Except forDa SilvaNeves, which\ndid not resolve the issue, all those decisions also held, on the\nmerits, that the INA allows equitable tolling in certain\ncircumstances. Seeinfra, at 7\u20138.2We appointed William R.\nPeterson to brief and argue the case, 574 U. S. ___ (2015), and he\nhas ably discharged his responsibilities.3We express no opinion as\nto whether or when the INA allows the Board to equitably toll the\n90-day period to file a motion to reopen. Moreover, we are not\ncertain what the Fifth Circuit itself thinks about that question.\nPerhaps, asamicusasserts, the court believes the INA\ncategorically precludes equitable tolling: It is hard to come up\nwith any other reason why the court construes every argument for\ntolling as one forsua\u00a0sponterelief. See Brief forAmicusCuriaeby Invitation of the Court 2, 10, 14,\nn.\u00a02. But the Fifth Circuit has stated that position in only a\nsingle sentence in a single unpublished opinion, which (according\nto the Circuit) has no precedential force. SeeLinv.Mukasey, 286 Fed. Appx. 148, 150 (2008) (per curiam);\nRule 47.5.4 (2015). And another unpublished decision cuts in the\nopposite direction, \u201chold[ing] that the doctrine of equitable\ntolling applies\u201d when exceptional circumstances excuse an alien\u2019s\nfailure to meet the 90-day reopening deadline. SeeTorabiv.Gonzales, 165 Fed. Appx. 326, 331 (CA5 2006) (per\ncuriam). So, in the end, it is hard to say.",
