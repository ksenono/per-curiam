After reviewing the parties\u2019 submissions, we\ndismiss the first question as improvidently granted. We decide the\nsecond question and hold thatthe officers are entitled to qualified\nimmunity because they did not violate any clearly established\nFourth Amendment rights.IPetitioners are the City and County of San\nFrancisco, California (San Francisco), and two police officers,\nSergeant Kimberly Reynolds and Officer Kathrine Holder. Respondent\nis Teresa Sheehan, a woman who suffers from a schizoaffective\ndisorder. Because this case arises in a summary judgment posture,\nwe view the facts in the light most favorable to Sheehan, the\nnonmoving party. See,e.g., Plumhoffv.Rickard, 572\nU.\u00a0S. ___, ___\u2013___ (2014) (slip op., at 1\u20132).In August 2008, Sheehan lived in a group home\nfor people dealing with mental illness. Although she shared common\nareas of the building with others, she had a private room. On\nAugust 7, Heath Hodge, a social worker who supervised the\ncounseling staff in the building, attempted to visit Sheehan to\nconduct a welfare check. Hodge was concerned because Sheehan had\nstopped taking her medication, no longer spoke with her\npsychiatrist, and reportedly was no longer changing her clothes or\neating. See 743 F.\u00a03d 1211, 1218 (CA9 2014); App. 23\u201324.Hodge knocked on Sheehan\u2019s door but received no\nanswer. He then used a key to enter her room and found Sheehan on\nher bed. Initially, she would not respond to questions. But she\nthen sprang up, reportedly yelling, \u201cGet out of here! You don\u2019t\nhave a warrant! I have a knife, and I\u2019ll kill you if I have to.\u201d\nHodge left without seeing whether she actually had a knife, and\nSheehan slammed the door shut behind him. See 743 F.\u00a03d, at\n1218.Sheehan, Hodge realized, required \u201csome sort of\nintervention,\u201d App. 96, but he also knew that he would need help.\nHodge took steps to clear the building of other people and\ncompleted an application to have Sheehan detained for temporary\nevaluation and treatment. See Cal. Welf. & Inst. Code Ann.\n\u00a75150 (West 2015 Cum. Supp.) (authorizing temporary detention of\nsomeone who \u201cas a result of a mental health disorder, is a danger\nto others, or to himself or herself, or gravely disabled\u201d). On that\napplication, Hodge checked off boxes indicating that Sheehan was a\n\u201cthreat to others\u201d and \u201cgravely disabled,\u201d but he did not mark that\nshe was a danger to herself. 743 F.\u00a03d, at 1218. He telephoned\nthe police and asked for help to take Sheehan to a secure\nfacility.Officer Holder responded to police dispatch and\nheaded toward the group home. When she arrived, Holder reviewed the\ntemporary-detention application and spoke with Hodge. Holder then\nsought assistance from Sergeant Reynolds, a more experienced\nofficer. After Reynolds arrived and was brought up to speed, Hodge\nspoke with a nurse at the psychiatric emergency services unit at\nSan Francisco General Hospital who said that the hospital would be\nable to admit Sheehan.Accompanied by Hodge, the officers went to\nSheehan\u2019s room, knocked on her door, announced who they were, and\ntold Sheehan that \u201cwe want to help you.\u201d App. 36. When Sheehan did\nnot answer, the officers used Hodge\u2019s key to enter the room.\nSheehan reacted violently. She grabbed a kitchen knife with an\napproximately 5-inch blade and began approaching the officers,\nyelling something along the lines of \u201cI am going to kill you. I\ndon\u2019t need help. Get out.\u201dIbid.See alsoid., at 284\n(\u201c[Q.] Did you tell them I\u2019ll kill you if you don\u2019t get out of\nhere? A. Yes\u201d). The officers\u2014who did not have their weapons\ndrawn\u2014\u201cretreated and Sheehan closed the door, leaving Sheehan in\nher room and the officers and Hodge in the hallway.\u201d 743\nF.\u00a03d, at 1219. The officers called for backup and sent Hodge\ndownstairs to let in reinforcements when they arrived.The officers were concerned that the door to\nSheehan\u2019s room was closed. They worried that Sheehan, out of their\nsight, might gather more weapons\u2014Reynolds had already observed\nother knives in her room, see App. 228\u2014or even try to flee through\nthe back window,id., at 227. Because Sheehan\u2019s room was on\nthe second floor, she likely would have needed a ladder to escape.\nFire escapes, however, are common in San Francisco, and the\nofficers did not know whether Sheehan\u2019s room had such an escape.\n(Neither officer asked Hodge about a fire escape, but if they had,\nit seems he \u201cprobably\u201d would have said there was one,id.,\nat 117). With the door closed, all that Reynolds and Holder knew\nfor sure was that Sheehan was unstable, she had just threatened to\nkill three people, and she had a weapon.[1]Reynolds and Holder had to make a decision. They\ncould wait for backup\u2014indeed, they already heard sirens. Or they\ncould quickly reenter the room and try to subdue Sheehan before\nmore time elapsed. Because Reynolds believed that the situation\n\u201crequired [their] immediate attention,\u201did., at 235, the\nofficers chose reentry. In making that decision, they did not pause\nto consider whether Sheehan\u2019s disability should be accommodated.\nSee 743 F.\u00a03d, at 1219. The officers obviously knew that\nSheehan was unwell, but in Reynolds\u2019 words, that was \u201ca secondary\nissue\u201d given that they were \u201cfaced with a violent woman who had\nalready threatened to kill her social worker\u201d and \u201ctwo uniformed\npolice officers.\u201d App. 235.The officers ultimately decided that Holder\u2014the\nlarger officer\u2014should push the door open while Reynolds used pepper\nspray on Sheehan. With pistols drawn, the officers moved in. When\nSheehan, knife in hand, saw them, she again yelled for them to\nleave. She may also have again said that she was going to kill\nthem. Sheehan is \u201cnot sure\u201d if she threatened death a second time,id., at 284, but \u201cconcedes that it was her intent to resist\narrest and to use the knife,\u201d 743 F.\u00a03d, at 1220. In any\nevent, Reynolds began pepper-spraying Sheehan in the face, but\nSheehan would not drop the knife. When Sheehan was only a few feet\naway, Holder shot her twice, but she did not collapse. Reynolds\nthen fired multiple shots.[2]\nAfter Sheehan finally fell, a third officer (who had just arrived)\nkicked the knife out of her hand. Sheehan survived.Sometime later, San Francisco prosecuted Sheehan\nfor assault with a deadly weapon, assault on a peace officer with a\ndeadly weapon, and making criminal threats. The jury acquitted\nSheehan of making threats but was unable to reach a verdict on the\nassault counts, and prosecutors decided not to retry her.Sheehan then brought suit, alleging, among other\nthings, that San Francisco violated the Americans with Disabilities\nAct of 1990 (ADA), 104Stat. 327, 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a712101et\u00a0seq.,by subduing her in a manner that did not\nreasonably accommodate her disability. She also sued Reynolds and\nHolder in their personal capacities under Rev. Stat. \u00a71979, 42\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71983, for violating her Fourth Amendment\nrights. In support of her claims, she offered testimony from a\nformer deputy police chief, Lou Reiter, who contended that Reynolds\nand Holder fell short of their training by not using practices\ndesigned to minimize the risk of violence when dealing with the\nmentally ill.The District Court granted summary judgment for\npetitioners. Relying onHainzev.Richards, 207\nF.\u00a03d 795 (CA5 2000), the court held that officers making an\narrest are not required \u201cto first determine whether their actions\nwould comply with the ADA before protecting themselves and others.\u201d\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 80. The court also held that the officers\ndid not violate the Fourth Amendment. The court wrote that the\nofficers \u201chad no way of knowing whether [Sheehan] might escape\nthrough a back window or fire escape, whether she might hurt\nherself, or whether there was anyone else in her room whom she\nmight hurt.\u201dId., at 71. In addition, the court observed\nthat Holder did not begin shooting until it was necessary for her\nto do so in order \u201cto protect herself\u201d and that \u201cReynolds used\ndeadly force only after she found that pepper spray was not enough\nforce to contain the situation.\u201dId., at 75, 76\u201377.On appeal, the Ninth Circuit vacated in part.\nRelevant here, the panel held that because the ADA covers public\n\u201cservices, programs, or activities,\u201d \u00a712132, the ADA\u2019s\naccommodation requirement should be read to \u201cto encompass \u2018anything\na public entity does,\u2019\u00a0\u201d 743 F.\u00a03d, at 1232. The Ninth\nCircuit agreed \u201cthat exigent circumstances inform the\nreasonableness analysis under the ADA,\u201dibid.,but concluded\nthat it was for a jury to decide whether San Francisco should have\naccommodated Sheehan by, for instance, \u201crespect[ing] her comfort\nzone, engag[ing] in non-threatening communications and us[ing] the\npassage of time to defuse the situation rather than precipitating a\ndeadly confrontation.\u201dId.,at 1233.As to Reynolds and Holder, the panel held that\ntheir initial entry into Sheehan\u2019s room was lawful and that, after\nthe officers opened the door for the second time, they reasonably\nused their firearms when the pepper spray failed to stop Sheehan\u2019s\nadvance. Nonetheless, the panel also held that a jury could find\nthat the officers \u201cprovoked\u201d Sheehan by needlessly forcing that\nsecond confrontation.Id.,at 1216, 1229. The panel further\nfound that it was clearly established that an officer cannot\n\u201cforcibly enter the home of an armed, mentally ill subject who had\nbeen acting irrationally and had threatened anyone who entered when\nthere was no objective need for immediate entry.\u201dId.,at\n1229. Dissenting in part, Judge Graber would have held that the\nofficers were entitled to qualified immunity.San Francisco and the officers petitioned for a\nwrit of certiorari and asked us to review two questions. We granted\nthe petition. 574 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2014).IITitle II of the ADA commands that \u201cno\nqualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such\ndisability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the\nbenefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public\nentity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.\u201d 42\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a712132. The first question on which we granted\nreview asks whether this provision \u201crequires law enforcement\nofficers to provide accommodations to an armed, violent, and\nmentally ill suspect in the course of bringing the suspect into\ncustody.\u201d Pet. for Cert. i. When we granted review, we understood\nthis question to embody what appears to be the thrust of the\nargument that San Francisco made in the Ninth Circuit, namely that\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018Title IIdoes not applyto an officer\u2019s\non-the-street responses to reported disturbances or other similar\nincidents, whether or not those calls involve subjects with mental\ndisabilities, prior to the officer\u2019s securing the scene and\nensuring that there is no threat to human life.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Brief for\nAppellees in No. 11\u201316401 (CA9), p. 36 (quotingHainze,supra, at 801; emphasis added); see also Brief for Appellees\nin No. 11\u201316401, at 37 (similar).As San Francisco explained in its reply brief at\nthe certiorari stage, resolving its \u201cquestion presented\u201d \u201cdoes not\nrequire a fact-intensive \u2018reasonable accommodation\u2019 inquiry,\u201d since\n\u201cthe only question for this Court to resolve is whether any\naccommodation of an armed and violent individual is reasonable or\nrequired under Title II of the ADA.\u201d Reply to Brief in Opposition\n3.Having persuaded us to grant certiorari, San\nFrancisco chose to rely on a different argument than what it\npressed below. In its brief in this Court, San Francisco focuses on\nthe statutory phrase \u201cqualified individual,\u201d \u00a712132, and a\nregulation declaring that Title II \u201cdoes not require a public\nentity to permit an individual to participate in or benefit from\nthe services, programs, or activities of that public entity when\nthat individual poses a direct threat to the health or safety of\nothers.\u201d 28 CFR \u00a735.139(a) (2014). Another regulation defines a\n\u201cdirect threat\u201d as \u201ca significant risk to the health or safety of\nothers that cannot be eliminated by a modification of policies,\npractices or procedures, or by the provision of auxiliary aids or\nservices.\u201d \u00a735.104. Putting these authorities together, San\nFran-cisco argues that \u201ca person who poses a direct threat or\nsignificant risk to the safety of others is not qualified for\naccommodations under the ADA,\u201d Brief for Petitioners 17. Contending\nthat Sheehan clearly posed a \u201cdirect threat,\u201d San Francisco\nconcludes that she was therefore not \u201cqualified\u201d for an\naccommodation.Though, to be sure, this \u201cqualified\u201d argument\ndoes appear in San Francisco\u2019s certiorari petition, San Francisco\nnever hinted at it in the Ninth Circuit. The Court does not\nordinarily decide questions that were not passed on below. More\nthan that, San Francisco\u2019s new argument effectively concedes that\nthe relevant provision of the ADA, 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a712132,may\u201crequir[e] law enforcement officers to provide\naccommodations to an armed, violent, and mentally ill suspect in\nthe course of bringing the suspect into custody.\u201d Pet. for Cert. i.\nThis is so because there may be circumstances in which any\n\u201csignificant risk\u201d presented by \u201can armed, violent, and mentally\nill suspect\u201d can be \u201celiminated by a modification of policies,\npractices or procedures, or by the provision of auxiliary aids or\nservices.\u201dThe argument that San Francisco now advances is\npredicated on the proposition that the ADA governs the manner in\nwhich a qualified individual with a disability is arrested. The\nrelevant provision provides that a public entity may not\n\u201cexclud[e]\u201d a qualified individual with a disability from\n\u201cparticipat[ing] in,\u201d and may not \u201cden[y]\u201d that individual the\n\u201cbenefits of[,] the services, programs, or activities of a public\nentity.\u201d \u00a712132. This language would apply to an arrest if an\narrest is an \u201cactivity\u201d in which the arrestee \u201cparticipat[es]\u201d or\nfrom which the arrestee may \u201cbenefi[t].\u201dThis same provision also commands that \u201cno\nqualified individual with a disability shall be .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nsubjected to discrimination by any [public] entity.\u201dIbid.This part of the statute would apply to an arrest if the failure to\narrest an individual with a mental disability in a manner that\nreasonably accommodates that disability constitutes\n\u201cdiscrimination.\u201dIbid.Whether the statutory language quoted above\napplies to arrests is an important question that would benefit from\nbriefing and an adversary presentation. But San Fran-cisco, the\nUnited States asamicus curiae, and Sheehan all argue (or at\nleast accept) that \u00a712132 applies to arrests. No one argues the\ncontrary view. As a result, we do not think that it would be\nprudent to decide the question in this case.Our decision not to decide whether the ADA\napplies to arrests is reinforced by the parties\u2019 failure to address\na related question: whether a public entity can be liable for\ndamages under Title II for an arrest made by its police officers.\nOnly public entities are subject to Title II, see,e.g.,Pennsylvania Dept. of Correctionsv.Yeskey, 524\nU.\u00a0S. 206, 208 (1998) , and the parties agree that such an\nentity can be held vicariously liable for money damages for the\npurposeful or deliberately indifferent conduct of its employees.\nSee Tr. of Oral Arg. 10\u201312, 22. But we have never decided whether\nthat is correct, and we decline to do so here, in the absence of\nadversarial briefing.Because certiorari jurisdiction exists to\nclarify the law, its exercise \u201cis not a matter of right, but of\njudicial discretion.\u201d Supreme Court Rule 10. Exercising that\ndiscretion, we dismiss the first question presented as\nimprovidently granted. See,e.g., Board of Trustees of Univ. of\nAla.v.Garrett, 531 U.\u00a0S. 356, 360, n. 1 (2001)\n(partial dismissal);Parkerv.Dugger, 498 U.\u00a0S.\n308, 323 (1991) (same).IIIThe second question presented is whether\nReynolds and Holder can be held personally liable for the injuries\nthat Sheehan suffered. We conclude they are entitled to qualified\nimmunity.[3]Public officials are immune from suit under 42\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71983 unless they have \u201cviolated a statutory or\nconstitutional right that was clearly established at the time of\nthe challenged conduct.\u201dPlumhoff, 572 U.\u00a0S., at ___\n(slip op., at 12) (internal quotation marks omitted). An officer\n\u201ccannot be said to have violated a clearly established right unless\nthe right\u2019s contours were sufficiently definite that any reasonable\nofficial in [his] shoes would have understood that he was violating\nit,\u201dibid.,meaning that \u201cexisting precedent .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nplaced the statutory or constitutional question beyond debate.\u201dAshcroftv.al-Kidd, 563 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2011)\n(slip op., at 9). This exacting standard \u201cgives government\nofficials breathing room to make reasonable but mistaken judgments\u201d\nby \u201cprotect[ing] all but the plainly incompetent or those who\nknowingly violate the law.\u201dId.,at ___ (slip op., at\n12).In this case, although we disagree with the\nNinth Circuit\u2019s ultimate conclusion on the question of qualified\nimmunity, we agree with its analysis in many respects. For\ninstance, there is no doubt that the officers did not violate any\nfederal right when they opened Sheehan\u2019s door the first time. See\n743 F.\u00a03d, at 1216, 1223. Reynolds and Holder knocked on the\ndoor, announced that they were police officers, and informed\nSheehan that they wanted to help her. When Sheehan did not come to\nthe door, they entered her room. This was not unconstitutional.\n\u201c[L]aw enforcement officers may enter a home without a warrant to\nrender emergency assistance to an injured occupant or to protect an\noccupant from imminent injury.\u201dBrigham Cityv.Stuart, 547 U.\u00a0S. 398, 403 (2006) . See alsoKentuckyv.King, 563 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2011)\n(slip op., at 6).Nor is there any doubt that had Sheehan not been\ndis-abled, the officers could have opened her door the second time\nwithout violating any constitutional rights. For one thing,\n\u201cbecause the two entries were part of a single, continuous search\nor seizure, the officers [were] not required to justify the\ncontinuing emergency with respect to the second entry.\u201d 743\nF.\u00a03d, at 1224 (followingMichiganv.Tyler, 436\nU.\u00a0S. 499, 511 (1978) ). In addition, Reynolds and Holder knew\nthat Sheehan had a weapon and had threatened to use it to kill\nthree people. They also knew that delay could make the situation\nmore dangerous. The Fourth Amendment standard is reasonableness,\nand it is reasonable for police to move quickly if delay \u201cwould\ngravely endanger their lives or the lives of others.\u201dWarden,\nMd. Penitentiaryv.Hayden, 387 U.\u00a0S. 294 \u2013299\n(1967). This is true even when, judged with the benefit of\nhindsight, the officers may have made \u201csome mistakes.\u201dHeienv.North Carolina, 574 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op.,\nat 5). The Constitution is not blind to \u201cthe fact that police\nofficers are often forced to make split-second judgments.\u201dPlumhoff,supra, at ___ (slip op., at 8).We also agree with the Ninth Circuit that after\nthe officers opened Sheehan\u2019s door the second time, their use of\nforce was reasonable. Reynolds tried to subdue Sheehan with pepper\nspray, but Sheehan kept coming at the officers until she was \u201conly\na few feet from a cornered Officer Holder.\u201d 743 F.\u00a03d, at\n1229. At this point, the use of potentially deadly force was\njustified. SeeScottv.Harris, 550 U.\u00a0S. 372,\n384 (2007) . Nothing in the Fourth Amendment barred Reynolds and\nHolder from protecting themselves, even though it meant firing\nmultiple rounds. SeePlumhoff,supra, at ___ (slip\nop., at 11).The real question, then, is whether, despite\nthese dangerous circumstances, the officers violated the Fourth\nAmendment when they decided to reopen Sheehan\u2019s door rather than\nattempting to accommodate her disability. Here we come to another\nproblem. San Francisco, whose attorneys represent Reynolds and\nHolder, devotes scant briefing to this question. Instead, San\nFrancisco argues almost exclusively that even if it is assumed that\nthere was a Fourth Amendment violation, the right was not clearly\nestablished. This Court, of course, could decide the constitutional\nquestion anyway. SeePearsonv.Callahan, 555\nU.\u00a0S. 223, 242 (2009) (recognizing discretion). But because\nthis question has not been adequately briefed, we decline to do so.\nSeeid., at 239. Rather, we simply decide whether the\nofficers\u2019 failure to accommodate Sheehan\u2019s illness violated clearly\nestablished law. It did not.To begin, nothing in our cases suggests the\nconstitutional rule applied by the Ninth Circuit. The Ninth Circuit\nfocused onGrahamv.Connor, 490 U.\u00a0S. 386\n(1989) , butGrahamholds only that the \u201c\u00a0\u2018objective\nreasonableness\u2019\u00a0\u201d test applies to excessive-force claims under\nthe Fourth Amendment. Seeid., at 388. That is far too\ngeneral a proposition to control this case. \u201cWe have repeatedly\ntold courts\u2014and the Ninth Circuit in particular\u2014not to define\nclearly established law at a high level of generality.\u201dal-Kidd,supra, at ___ (citation omitted) (slip op.,\nat 10); cf.Lopezv.Smith, 574 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___\n(2014) (per curiam) (slip op., at 5). Qualified immunity is\nno immunity at all if \u201cclearly established\u201d law can simply be\ndefined as the right to be free from unreasonable searches and\nseizures.Even a cursory glance at the facts ofGrahamconfirms just how different that case is from this\none. That case did not involve a dangerous, obviously unstable\nperson making threats, much less was there a weapon involved. There\nis a world of difference between needlessly withholding sugar from\nan innocent person who is suffering from an insulin reaction, seeGraham,supra, at 388\u2013389, and responding to the\nperilous situation Reynolds and Holder confronted.Grahamis\na nonstarter.Moving beyondGraham, the Ninth Circuit\nalso turned to two of its own cases. But even if \u201ca controlling\ncircuit precedent could constitute clearly established federal law\nin these circumstances,\u201dCarrollv.Carman, 574\nU.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2014) (per curiam) (slip op., at 4), it\ndoes not do so here.The Ninth Circuit first pointed toDeorlev.Rutherford, 272 F. 3d 1272 (CA9 2001), but from the very\nfirst paragraph of that opinion we learn thatDeorleinvolved an officer\u2019s use of a beanbag gun to subdue \u201can\nemotionally disturbed\u201d person who \u201cwas unarmed, had not attacked or\neven touched anyone, had generally obeyed the instructions given\nhim by various police officers, and had not committed any serious\noffense.\u201dId., at 1275. The officer there, moreover,\n\u201cobserved Deorle at close proximity for about five to ten minutes\nbefore shooting him\u201d in the face. Seeid., at 1281. Whatever\nthe merits of the decision inDeorle, the differences\nbetween that case and the case before us leap from the page. Unlike\nDeorle, Sheehan was dangerous, recalcitrant, law-breaking, and out\nof sight.The Ninth Circuit also leaned onAlexanderv.City and County of San Francisco, 29 F.\n3d 1355 (CA9 1994), another case involving mental illness. There,\nofficials from San Francisco attempted to enter Henry Quade\u2019s home\n\u201cfor the primary purpose of arresting him\u201d even though they lacked\nan arrest warrant.Id., at 1361. Quade, in response, fired a\nhandgun; police officers \u201cshot back, and Quade died from gunshot\nwounds shortly thereafter.\u201dId., at 1358. The panel\nconcluded that a jury should decide whether the officers used\nexcessive force. The court reasoned that the officers provoked the\nconfrontation because there were no \u201cexigent circumstances\u201d\nexcusing their entrance.Id., at 1361.Alexandertoo is a poor fit. As Judge\nGraber observed below in her dissent, the Ninth Circuit has long\nreadAlexandernarrowly. See 743 F.\u00a03d, at 1235\n(Graber, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (citingBillingtonv.Smith, 292 F. 3d 1177 (CA9 2002)).\nUnder Ninth Circuit law,[4] an\nentry that otherwise complies with the Fourth Amendment is not\nrendered unreasonable because it provokes a violent reaction. Seeid.,at 1189\u20131190. Under this rule, qualified immunity\nnecessarily applies here because, as explained above, competent\nofficers could have believed that the second entry was justified\nunder both continuous search and exigent circumstance rationales.\nIndeed, even if Reynolds and Holder misjudged the situation,\nSheehan cannot \u201cestablish a Fourth Amendment violation based merely\non bad tactics that result in a deadly confrontation that could\nhave been avoided.\u201dId.,at 1190. Courts must not judge\nofficers with \u201cthe 20/20 vision of hindsight.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIbid.(quotingGraham, 490 U.\u00a0S., at 396).WhenGraham,Deorle, andAlexanderare viewed together, the central error in the\nNinth Circuit\u2019s reasoning is apparent. The panel majority concluded\nthat these three cases \u201cwould have placed any reasonable, competent\nofficer on notice that it is unreasonable to forcibly enter the\nhome of an armed, mentally ill suspect who had been acting\nirrationally and had threatened anyone who entered when there was\nno objective need for immediate entry.\u201d 743 F.\u00a03d, at 1229.\nBut even assuming that is true,no precedent clearly established\nthat therewasnot\u201can objective need for\nimmediate entry\u201dhere. No matter how carefully a\nreasonable officer readGraham,Deorle, andAlexanderbeforehand, that officer could not know that\nreopening Sheehan\u2019s door to prevent her from escaping or gathering\nmore weapons would violate the Ninth Circuit\u2019s test, even if all\nthe disputed facts are viewed in respondent\u2019s favor. Without that\n\u201cfair notice,\u201d an officer is entitled to qualified immunity. See,e.g., Plumhoff, 572 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at\n13).Nor does it matter for purposes of qualified\nimmunity that Sheehan\u2019s expert, Reiter, testified that the officers\ndid not follow their training. According to Reiter, San Francisco\ntrains its officers when dealing with the mentally ill to \u201censure\nthat sufficient resources are brought to the scene,\u201d \u201ccontain the\nsubject\u201d and \u201crespect the suspect\u2019s \u201ccomfort zone,\u201d \u201cuse time to\ntheir advantage,\u201d and \u201cemploy non-threatening verbal communication\nand open-ended questions to facilitate the subject\u2019s participation\nin communication.\u201d Brief for Respondent 7. Likewise, San\nFrancisco\u2019s policy is \u201c\u00a0\u2018to use hostage negotiators\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nwhen dealing with \u201c\u00a0\u2018a suspect [who] resists arrest by\nbarricading himself.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId.,at 8 (quoting San\nFrancisco Police Department General Order 8.02, \u00a7II(B) (Aug. 3,\n1994), online at http://www.sf-police.org (as visited May 14, 2015,\nand available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file)).Even if an officer acts contrary to her\ntraining, however, (and here, given the generality of that\ntraining, it is not at all clear that Reynolds and Holder did so),\nthat does not itself negate qualified immunity where it would\notherwise be warranted. Rather, so long as \u201ca reasonable officer\ncould have believed that his conduct was justified,\u201d a plaintiff\ncannot \u201cavoi[d] summary judgment by simply producing an expert\u2019s\nreport that an officer\u2019s conduct leading up to a deadly\nconfrontation was imprudent, inappropriate, or even reckless.\u201dBillington,supra,at 1189.Cf.Saucierv.Katz, 533 U.\u00a0S. 194, 216, n. 6 (2001) (Ginsburg, J.,\nconcurring in judgment) (\u201c\u00a0\u2018[I]n close cases, a jury does not\nautomatically get to second-guess these life and death decisions,\neven though a plaintiff has an expert and a plausible claim that\nthe situation could better have been handled differently\u2019\u00a0\u201d\n(quotingRoyv.Inhabitants of Lewiston, 42\nF.\u00a03d 691, 695 (CA1 1994))). Considering the specific\nsituation confronting Reynolds and Holder, they had sufficient\nreason to believe that their conduct was justified.Finally, to the extent that a \u201crobust consensus\nof cases of persuasive authority\u201d could itself clearly establish\nthe federal right respondent alleges,al-Kidd,563\nU.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 10), no such consensus exists\nhere. If anything, the opposite may be true. See,e.g.,\nBatesv.Chesterfield County, 216 F.\u00a03d 367, 372\n(CA4 2000) (\u201cKnowledge of a person\u2019s disability simply cannot\nforeclose officers from protecting themselves, the disabled person,\nand the general public\u201d);Sandersv.Minneapolis, 474\nF.\u00a03d 523, 527 (CA8 2007) (followingBates, supra);Menuelv.Atlanta, 25 F.\u00a03d 990 (CA11 1994)\n(upholding use of deadly force to try to apprehend a mentally ill\nman who had a knife and was hiding behind a door).In sum, we hold that qualified immunity applies\nbecause these officers had no \u201cfair and clear warning of what the\nConstitution requires.\u201dal-Kidd,supra, at ___\n(Ken-nedy, J., concurring) (slip op., at 3). Because the qualified\nimmunity analysis is straightforward, we need not decide whether\nthe Constitution was violated by the officers\u2019 failure to\naccommodate Sheehan\u2019s illness.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*For these reasons, the first question\npresented is dismissed as improvidently granted. On the second\nquestion, we reverse the judgment of the Ninth Circuit. The case is\nremanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.Justice Breyer took no part in the consideration\nor decision of this case.Notes1The officers also may\nhave feared that another person was with Sheehan. Reynolds\ntestified that the officers had not been \u201cable to do a complete\nassessment of the entire room.\u201d App. 38. Sheehan, by contrast,\ntestified during a deposition that the officers \u201ccould see\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. that no one else was in the room.\u201dId., at\n279. Before the Ninth Circuit, Sheehan conceded that some of her\ndeposition testimony \u201csmacks of irrationality that begs the\nquestion whether any of it is credible.\u201d Brief for Appellant in No.\n11\u201316401 (CA9), p. 41; see also Reply Brief in No. 11\u201316401,\np.\u00a017 (explaining that \u201cthe inherent inconsistences in her\ntestimony cast suspicion over all of it\u201d). We need not decide\nwhether there is a genuine dispute of fact here because the\nofficers\u2019 other, independent concerns make this point\nimmaterial.2There is a dispute\nregarding whether Sheehan was on the ground for the last shot. This\ndispute is not material: \u201cEven if Sheehan was on the ground, she\nwas certainly not subdued.\u201d 743 F.\u00a03d 1211, 1230 (CA9\n2014).3Not satisfied with\ndismissing question one, which concernsSan Francisco\u2019sliability, our dissenting colleagues would further punish San\nFrancisco by dismissing question two as well. Seepost, at 3\n(opinion of Scalia, J.) (arguing that deciding the second question\nwould \u201creward\u201d San Francisco and \u201cspar[e it] the significant\nexpense of defending the suit, and satisfying any judgment, against\nthe individual petitioners\u201d). But question two concerns theliability of the individual officers.Whatever contractual\nobligations San Francisco may (or may not) have to represent and\nindemnify the officers are not our concern. At a minimum, these\nofficers have a personal interest in the correctness of the\njudgment below, which holds that they may have violated the\nConstitution. Moreover, when we granted the petition, we determined\nthat both questions independently merited review. Because of the\nimportance of qualified immunity \u201cto society as a whole,\u201dHarlowv.Fitzgerald, 457 U.\u00a0S. 800, 814 (1982)\n, the Court often corrects lower courts when they wrongly subject\nindividual officers to liability. See,e.g., Carrollv.Carman,574 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2014) (per curiam);Woodv.Moss, 572 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2014);Plumhoffv.Rickard, 572 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2014);Stantonv.Sims, 571 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2013) (per\ncuriam);Reichlev.Howards, 566 U.\u00a0S. ___\n(2012).4Our citation to Ninth\nCircuit cases should not be read to suggest our agreement (or, for\nthat matter, disagreement) with them. The Ninth Circuit\u2019s\n\u201cprovocation\u201d rule, for instance, has been sharply questioned\nelsewhere. SeeLivermorev.Lubelan, 476 F.\u00a03d\n397, 406\u2013407 (CA6 2007); see also,e.g.,Hectorv.Watt, 235 F.\u00a03d 154, 160 (CA3 2001) (\u201c[I]f the\nofficers\u2019 use of force was reasonable given the plaintiff\u2019s acts,\nthen despite the illegal entry, the plaintiff\u2019s own conduct would\nbe an intervening cause\u201d). Whatever their merits, all that matters\nfor our qualified immunity analysis is that they do not clearly\nestablish any right that the officers violated.",
