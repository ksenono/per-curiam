S. ____ (2009)SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESNO. 08-681JEAN MARC NKEN, PETITIONERv.ERIC H.\nHOLDER, Jr., ATTORNEY GENERALon writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the fourth circuit[April 22, 2009]Justice Alito, with whom Justice\nThomas joins, dissenting.The Court\u2019s decision nullifies an\nimportant statutory provision that Congress enacted when it\nreformed the immigration laws in 1996. I would give effect to that\nprovision, and I therefore respectfully dissent.IWhen an alien is charged with\nbeing removable from the United States, an Immigration Judge (IJ)\nconducts a hearing, receives and considers evidence, and determines\nwhether the alien is removable. See 8 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71229a(a); 8\nCFR \u00a7\u00a71240.1(a)(1)(i), (c) (2008). If the IJ enters an order of\nremoval, that order becomes final when the alien\u2019s appeal to the\nBoard of Immigration Appeals (Board) is unsuccessful or the alien\ndeclines to appeal to the Board. See 8 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71101(47)(B);\n8 CFR \u00a7\u00a71241.1, 1241.31. Once an order of removal has become final,\nit may be executed at any time. See 8 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7\u00a71231(a)(1)(B)(i), 1252(b)(8)(C); 8 CFR \u00a71241.33. Removal orders\n\u201care self-executing orders, not dependent upon judicial\nenforcement.\u201dStonev.INS,514 U. S. 386, 398 (1995).After the removal order is final\nand enforceable, the alien may file a motion to reopen before the\nIJ, see 8 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71229a(c)(7), or a petition for review\nbefore the appropriate court of appeals, see \u00a71252(a)(1). While\neither challenge is pending, the alien may ask the Executive Branch\nto stay its own hand. See 8 CFR \u00a7\u00a7241.6(a)\u2013(b), 1241.6(a)\u2013(b). If,\nhowever, the alien wantsa courtto restrain the Executive\nfrom executing a final and enforceable removal order, the alien\nmust seek an injunction to do so. See 8 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71252(a)(1)\n(making a final order of removal subject to 28 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a72349(b), which provides that an \u201cinterlocutory injunction\u201d can\n\u201crestrain\u201d the \u201cexecution of\u201d a final order). The plain text of the\nIllegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996\n(IIRIRA), Div. C, 110 Stat. 3009\u2013546, provides the relevant legal\nstandard for granting such relief: \u201cNotwithstanding any other\nprovision of law, no court shall enjoin the removal of any alien\npursuant to a final order under this section unless the alien shows\nby clear and convincing evidence that the entry or execution of\nsuch order is prohibited as a matter of law.\u201d 8 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a71252(f)(2).IIIn my view, petitioner\u2019s request\nfor an order preventing his removal pending disposition of his\ncurrent petition for review was governed by 8 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a71252(f)(2). Petitioner is \u201cremova[ble] \u2026 pursuant to a final\norder,\u201d and he sought a court order to \u201cenjoin\u201d the Executive\nBranch\u2019s execution of that removal.AThere is no dispute that\npetitioner is \u201cremova[ble] \u2026 pursuant to a final order.\u201dIbid.On March 4, 2005, the IJ determined that petitioner\nwas removable under \u00a71227(a)(1)(B) and denied his claims for\nasylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention\nAgainst Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or\nPunishment (CAT), Dec. 10, 1984, S. Treaty Doc. No. 100\u201320, 1465\nU.\u00a0N.\u00a0T.\u00a0S. 85. See App. 32\u201343. Petitioner appealed\nto the Board, and on June 16, 2006, the Board affirmed.Id., at 44\u201349. On that date, petitioner\u2019s order of removal\nbecame administratively final, and the Executive Branch became\nlegally entitled to remove him from the United States. See 8 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a71231(a)(1)(B)(i); 8 CFR \u00a71241.33(a).BThe only remaining question,\ntherefore, is whether the interim equitable relief that petitioner\nsought was an order \u201cenjoin[ing]\u201d his removal as that term is used\nin 8 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71252(f)(2). I believe that it was.In ordinary usage, the term\n\u201cenjoin\u201d means to \u201crequire,\u201d \u201ccommand,\u201d or \u201cdirect\u201d an action, or\nto \u201crequire a person \u2026 to perform, or to abstain or desist from,\nsome act.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 529 (6th ed. 1990) (hereinafter\nBlack\u2019s). See also Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 754\n(1993) (defining \u201cenjoin\u201d to mean \u201cto direct, prescribe, or impose\nby order\u201d; \u201cto prohibit or restrain by a judicial order or\ndecree\u201d). When an alien subject to a final order of removal seeks\nto bar executive officials from acting upon that order pending\njudicial consideration of a petition for review, the alien is\nseeking to \u201cenjoin\u201d his or her removal. The alien is seeking an\norder \u201crestrain[ing]\u201d those officials and \u201crequir[ing]\u201d them to\n\u201cabstain\u201d from executing the order of removal.The Court concludes that \u00a71252(f)(2) does not\napply in this case because, in the Court\u2019s view, that provision\napplies only to requests for an injunction and not to requests for\na stay. That conclusion is wrong for at least three reasons.1First, a stay is \u201ca kind of\ninjunction,\u201d Black\u2019s 1413, as even the Court grudgingly concedes,\nseeante, at 10 (an order blocking an alien\u2019s removal\npending judicial review \u201cmight technically be called an\ninjunction\u201d). See alsoTeshome-Gebreegziabherv.Mukasey,528 F.\u00a03d 330, 333 (CA4 2008) (the term\n\u201cstay\u201d \u201cis a subset of the broader term \u2018enjoin,\u2019\u00a0\u201d);Kijowskav.Haines, 463 F.\u00a03d 583, 589 (CA7\n2006) (a stay \u201cis a form of injunction\u201d);Wengv.United States Atty. Gen., 287 F.\u00a03d 1335, 1338 (CA11\n2002) (\u201c[T]he plain meaning of enjoin includes the grant of a\nstay\u201d).Both statutes and judicial\ndecisions refer to orders that \u201cstay\u201d legal proceedings as\ninjunctions. For example, the Anti-Injunction Act provides that\n\u201c[a] court of the United States may not grant an injunction to stay\nproceedings in a State court.\u201d 28 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a72283. See alsoHillv.McDonough,547 U. S. 573, 578\u2013580\n(2006) (habeas petitioner sought injunction to stay his execution);McMillenv.Anderson,95 U. S. 37, 42 (1877)\n(\u201c[Petitioner] can, if he is wrongfully taxed, stay the proceeding\nfor its collection by process of injunction\u201d);Nivensv.Gilchrist,319 F.\u00a03d 151, 153 (CA4 2003) (denial of\n\u201cinjunction\u201d to \u201cstay [a] trial\u201d);Jove Eng., Inc.v.IRS,92 F.\u00a03d 1539, 1546 (CA11 1996) (automatic stay\nis \u201cessentially a court-ordered injunction\u201d). And it is revealing\nthat the standard that the Court adopts for determining whether a\nstay should be ordered is the standard that is used in weighing an\napplication for a preliminary injunction.Ante,at 14\n(adopting preliminary injunction standard set out inWinterv.Natural Resources Defense Council,\nInc., 555 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 14)).2Second, the context surrounding\nIIRIRA\u2019s enactment suggests that \u00a71252(f)(2) was an important\u2014not a\nsuperfluous\u2014statutory provision. This Court should interpret it\naccordingly.IIRIRA was designed to expedite\nremoval and restrict the ability of aliens to remain in this\ncountry pending judicial review. Before IIRIRA, the filing of a\npetition for review automatically stayed removal unless the court\nof appeals directed otherwise. 8 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71105a(a)(3) (1994\ned.) (repealed 1996). IIRIRA repealed this provision and, to drive\nhome the point, specifically provided that \u201c[s]ervice of the\npetition [for judicial review] . . .does notstay the\nremoval of an alien pending the court\u2019s decision on the petition,\nunless the court orders otherwise.\u201d \u00a71252(b)(3)(B) (2006 ed.)\n(emphasis added). In addition, \u201cmany provisions of IIRIRA are aimed\nat protecting the Executive\u2019s discretion from the courts.\u201dRenov.American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm.,525 U. S. 471,\n486 (1999) (emphasis deleted). Indeed, \u201cprotecting the Executive\u2019s\ndiscretion from the courts . . . can fairly be said to be the theme\nof the legislation.\u201dIbid. Section 1252(f)(2), which\nprovides that a court may not block removal during the judicial\nreview process unless a heightened standard is met, fits perfectly\nwithin this scheme.The Court\u2019s interpretation, by contrast,\nproduces anomalous results. If \u00a71252(f)(2) does not provide the\nstandard to be used by the courts in determining whether an alien\nshould be permitted to remain in this country pending judicial\nreview, then IIRIRA left the formulation of that standard entirely\nto the discretion of the courts. A Congress that sought to expedite\nremoval and limit judicial discretion is unlikely to have taken\nthat approach.More important, if \u00a71252(f)(2) does not set\nthe standard for blocking removal pending judicial review, then, as\nthe Court concedes, \u201cthe exact role of subsection (f)(2) . . . is\nnot easy to explain.\u201dAnte, at 12. \u201cIn construing a\nstatute we are obliged to give effect, if possible, to every word\nCongress used.\u201dReiterv.Sonotone Corp.,442 U. S. 330,\n339 (1979). We should not lightly conclude that Congress enacted a\nprovision that serves no function, and the Court\u2019s hyper-technical\ndistinction between an injunction and a stay does not provide a\nsufficient justification for adopting an interpretation that\nrenders \u00a71252(f)(2) meaningless. That result is particularly\nanomalous in the context of \u00a71252(f)(2), which Congress said should\napply \u201c[n]otwithstanding any other provision of law.\u201d3Third, if stays and injunctions\nreally are two entirely distinct concepts, the order that\npetitioner sought here is best viewed as an injunction. Insofar as\nthere is a difference between the two concepts, I agree with the\nCourt that it boils down to this: \u201cA stay \u2018simply suspend[s]\njudicial alteration of the status quo,\u2019\u00a0\u201d whereas an\ninjunction \u201c\u00a0\u2018grants judicial intervention that has been\nwithheld by lower courts.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAnte, at 9 (quotingOhio Citizens for Responsible Energy, Inc.v.NRC,479\nU. S. 1312, 1313 (1986) (Scalia, J., in chambers)). See also\nBlack\u2019s 1413 (defining a stay as an \u201cact of arresting a judicial\nproceeding by the order of a court\u201d). Here, petitioner did not seek\nan order \u201csuspend[ing] judicial alteration of the status quo.\u201d\nInstead, he sought an order barring Executive branch officials from\nremoving him from the country. Such an order is best viewed as an\ninjunction. SeeMcCarthyv.Briscoe,429 U. S. 1317, 1317,\nn.\u00a01 (1976) (Powell, J., in chambers) (although applicants\nclaimed to seek a \u201cstay,\u201d the court granted an \u201cinjunction\u201d because\n\u201cthe applicants actually [sought] affirmative relief\u201d against\nexecutive officials).Even if petitioner had sought to\nblock his removal pending judicial review of the order of removal,\nany interim order blocking his removal would best be termed an\ninjunction. When the Board affirmed petitioner\u2019s final removal\norder in 2006, it gave the Executive Branch all of the legal\nauthority it needed to remove petitioner from the United States\nimmediately. An order preventing an executive officer from\nexercising that authority does not \u201csimply suspend judicial\nalteration of the status quo.\u201dOhio Citizens for Responsible\nEnergy,supra, at 1313. Instead, such an order is\nmost properly termed an injunction because it blocks executive\nofficials from carrying out what they view as proper enforcement of\nthe immigration laws. And in that regard, it is significant that\nthe Hobbs Act\u2014which governs judicial review under IIRIRA, see 8 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a71252(a)(1)\u2014refers to an \u201capplication for aninterlocutory injunctionrestraining or suspending the\nenforcement, operation, or execution of, or setting aside\u201d a final\nadministrative order. 28 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a72349(b) (emphasis\nadded).In the present case, however, petitioner did\nnot seek to block his removal pending judicial review of his final\norder of removal. That review concluded long ago. What petitioner\nasked for was an order barring the Executive Branch from removing\nhim pending judicial review of an entirely different order, the\nBoard\u2019s order denying his third motion to reopen the proceedings.\nPetitioner\u2019s current petition for review does not contest the\ncorrectness of the removal order. Rather, he argues that the Board\nshould have set aside that order due to alleged changes in\nconditions in his home country. A motion to reopen an\nadministrative proceeding that is no longer subject to direct\njudicial review surely seeks \u201c\u00a0\u2018an orderalteringthe\nstatus quo.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAnte,at 9 (quotingTurner\nBroadcasting System, Inc.v.FCC,507 U. S. 1301, 1302\n(1993) (Rehnquist, C.\u00a0J., in chambers)). Consequently, the\nrelief that petitioner sought here is best categorized as an\ninjunction.IIIIn addition to its highly\ntechnical distinction between an injunction and a stay, the Court\nadvances several other justifications for its decision, but none is\npersuasive.The Court argues that applying 8\nU. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71252(f)(2) would \u201cdeprive\u201d us of our\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018customary\u2019 stay power.\u201dAnte, at 13. As noted\nabove, however, restricting judicial discretion was \u201cthe theme\u201d of\nIIRIRA,American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm., 525 U.\nS., at 486. And Congress is free to regulate or eliminate the\nrelief that federal courts may award, within constitutional limits\nthat the Court does not invoke here. Cf.INSv.St.\nCyr,533 U. S.\n289, 299\u2013300 (2001).The Court opines that subsection (b)(3)(B)\u2014not\nsubsection (f)(2)\u2014is \u201cthe natural place to locate an amendment to\nthe traditional standard governing the grant of stays.\u201dAnte, at 11. But I would not read too much into Congress\u2019\ndecision to locate such a provision in one subsection rather than\nin another subsection of the same provision. In addition, there is\nalso nothing \u201cunnatural\u201d about Congress\u2019 use of two separate\nsubsections of \u00a71252 to address a common subject. For example,\n\u00a71252(a)(2)(A) lists several matters over which \u201cno court shall\nhave jurisdiction to review,\u201d while \u00a71252(g) lists another subject\nover which \u201cno court shall have jurisdiction to hear any cause or\nclaim.\u201d The fact that those provisions are separated by five\nsubsections and framed in slightly different terms does not justify\nignoring them, just as the space and difference in terminology\nbetween \u00a71252(b)(3)(B) and \u00a71252(f)(2) cannot justify the Court\u2019s\nresult.Noting that the term \u201cstay\u201d is used in\n\u00a71252(b)(3)(B) but not in \u00a71252(f)(2), the Court infers that\nCongress did not intend that the latter provision apply to stays.Ante, at 10\u201311. But the use of the term \u201cstay\u201d in\nsubsection (b)(3)(B) is easy to explain. As noted above, prior to\nIIRIRA, the Immigration and Nationality Act provided for an\nautomatic \u201cstay\u201d of deportation upon the filing of a petition for\nreview unless the court of appeals directed otherwise. See 8 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a71105a(a)(3) (1994 ed.) (repealed 1996). The statute\nprovided:\u201cThe service of the petition for review upon [the\nAttorney General\u2019s agents] shallstaythe deportation of\nthe alien pending determination of the petition by the court \u2026\nunless the court otherwise directs \u2026\u00a0.\u201dIbid.(emphasis added).In IIRIRA, Congress repealed that provision and, to\nmake sure that the pre-IIRIRA practice would not be continued,\nenacted a new provision that explicitly inverted the prior\nrule:\u201cService of the petition on the officer or employee\ndoes notstaythe removal of an alien pending the court\u2019s\ndecision on the petition, unless the court orders otherwise.\u201d\n\u00a71252(b)(3)(B) (2006 ed.) (emphasis added).It is thus apparent that \u00a71252(b)(3)(B) uses the\nterm \u201cstay\u201d because that is the term that was used in the provision\nthat it replaced.Finally, the Court worries that applying\n\u00a71252(f)(2) would create inequitable results by allowing removable\naliens to remain in the United States only if they can prove the\nmerits of their claims under a \u201chigher standard\u201d than the one they\nwould otherwise have to satisfy.Ante, at 13. But as the\nCourt acknowledges,ante, at 4, IIRIRA specifically\ncontemplated that most aliens wishing to contest final orders of\nremoval would be forced to pursue their appeals from abroad. See\n\u00a7306(b), 110 Stat. 3009\u2013612 (repealing 8 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71105a (1994\ned.)). If such an alien seeks to remain in the United States\npending judicial review, IIRIRA provides that the alien must make\nthe heightened showing required under \u00a71252(f)(2). Congress did not\nthink that this scheme is inequitable, and we must heed what\n\u00a71252(f)(2) prescribes.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*In my view, the Fourth Circuit\nwas correct to apply \u00a71252(f)(2) and to deny petitioner\u2019s\napplication for an order barring his removal pending judicial\nreview. Therefore, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of\nAppeals.Thus, it is unremarkable that we have used\nthe word \u201cstay\u201d to describe an injunction blocking an\nadministrative order pending judicial review. SeeScripps-Howard Radio, Inc.v.FCC,316 U. S. 4(1942);ante, at 9\u201310, n. Indeed, our decision inScripps-Howard,supra, at 11\u2014like the Court\u2019s\ndecision today,ante, at 7, 14\u2014relied heavily onVirginian R. Co.v.United States,272 U. S. 658(1926),\nthe latter of which referred to \u201cstays\u201d as a subset of\n\u201cinjunctions.\u201d Seeid., at 669 (noting that the power to\nissue a \u201cstay\u201d \u201cto preserve thestatus quopending appeal\u201d\nis \u201can incident\u201d of the power \u201cto enjoin\u201d an administrative order);\nsee alsoid., at 671\u2013672 (referring interchangeably to a\nthree-judge district court\u2019s power to issue \u201cinjunctions\u201d and\n\u201cstays\u201d). In any event, bothScripps-HowardandVirginianare inapposite because petitioner here did not\nseek to \u201cstay\u201d his removal order pending judicial review of that\norder; rather, he sought to enjoin the Executive Branch from\nenforcing his removal order pending judicial review of an entirely\nseparate order. SeeStonev.INS,514 U.
