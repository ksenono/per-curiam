S. ____ (2011)SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESNO. 09-1272KENTUCKY, PETITIONERv.HOLLIS DESHAUN\nKINGon writ of certiorari to the supreme court of\nkentucky[May 16, 2011]Justice Alito delivered the\nopinion of the Court.It is well established that\n\u201cexigent circumstances,\u201d including the need to prevent the\ndestruction of evidence, permit police officers to conduct an\notherwise permissible search without first obtaining a warrant. In\nthis case, we consider whether this rule applies when police, by\nknocking on the door of a residence and announcing their presence,\ncause the occupants to attempt to destroy evidence. The Kentucky\nSupreme Court held that the exigent circumstances rule does not\napply in the case at hand because the police should have foreseen\nthat their conduct would prompt the occupants to attempt to destroy\nevidence. We reject this interpretation of the exigent\ncircumstances rule. The conduct of the police prior to their entry\ninto the apartment was entirely lawful. They did not violate the\nFourth Amendment or threaten to do so. In such a situation, the\nexigent circumstances rule applies.IAThis case concerns the search of\nan apartment in Lexington, Kentucky. Police officers set up a\ncontrolled buy of crack cocaine outside an apartment complex.\nUndercover Officer Gibbons watched the deal take place from an\nunmarked car in a nearby parking lot. After the deal occurred,\nGibbons radioed uniformed officers to move in on the suspect. He\ntold the officers that the suspect was moving quickly toward the\nbreezeway of an apartment building, and he urged them to \u201churry up\nand get there\u201d before the suspect entered an apartment. App.\n20.In response to the radio alert,\nthe uniformed officers drove into the nearby parking lot, left\ntheir vehicles, and ran to the breezeway. Just as they entered the\nbreezeway, they heard a door shut and detected a very strong odor\nof burnt marijuana. At the end of the breezeway, the officers saw\ntwo apartments, one on the left and one on the right, and they did\nnot know which apartment the suspect had entered. Gibbons had\nradioed that the suspect was running into the apartment on the\nright, but the officers did not hear this statement because they\nhad already left their vehicles. Because they smelled marijuana\nsmoke emanating from the apartment on the left, they approached the\ndoor of that apartment.Officer Steven Cobb, one of the uniformed\nofficers who approached the door, testified that the officers\nbanged on the left apartment door \u201cas loud as [they] could\u201d and\nannounced, \u201c\u00a0\u2018This is the police\u2019\u00a0\u201d or \u201c\u00a0\u2018Police,\npolice, police.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId.,at 22\u201323. Cobb said that\n\u201c[a]s soon as [the officers] started banging on the door,\u201d they\n\u201ccould hear people inside moving,\u201d and \u201c[i]t sounded as [though]\nthings were being moved inside the apartment.\u201dId.,at 24.\nThese noises, Cobb testified, led the officers to believe that\ndrug-related evidence was about to be destroyed.At that point, the officers announced that\nthey \u201cwere going to make entry inside the apartment.\u201dIbid.Cobb then kicked in the door, the officers entered\nthe apartment, and they found three people in the front room:\nrespondent Hollis King, respondent\u2019s girlfriend, and a guest who\nwas smoking marijuana.[Footnote\n1] The officers performed a protective sweep of the apartment\nduring which they saw marijuana and powder cocaine in plain view.\nIn a subsequent search, they also discovered crack cocaine, cash,\nand drug paraphernalia.Police eventually entered the apartment on the\nright. Inside, they found the suspected drug dealer who was the\ninitial target of their investigation.BIn the Fayette County Circuit\nCourt, a grand jury charged respondent with trafficking in\nmarijuana, first-degree trafficking in a controlled substance, and\nsecond-degree persistent felony offender status. Respondent filed a\nmotion to suppress the evidence from the warrantless search, but\nthe Circuit Court denied the motion. The Circuit Court concluded\nthat the officers had probable cause to investigate the marijuana\nodor and that the officers \u201cproperly conducted [the investigation]\nby initially knocking on the door of the apartment unit and\nawaiting the response or consensual entry.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert.\n9a. Exigent circumstances justified the warrantless entry, the\ncourt held, because \u201cthere was no response at all to the knocking,\u201d\nand because \u201cOfficer Cobb heard movement in the apartment which he\nreasonably concluded were persons in the act of destroying\nevidence, particularly narcotics because of the smell.\u201dIbid.Respondent then entered a conditional guilty plea,\nreserving his right to appeal the denial of his suppression motion.\nThe court sentenced respondent to 11 years\u2019 imprisonment.The Kentucky Court of Appeals\naffirmed. It held that exigent circumstances justified the\nwarrantless entry because the police reasonably believed that\nevidence would be destroyed. The police did not impermissibly\ncreate the exigency, the court explained, because they did not\ndeliberately evade the warrant requirement.The Supreme Court of Kentucky reversed. 302\nS.\u00a0W.\u00a03d 649 (2010). As a preliminary matter, the court\nobserved that there was \u201ccertainly some question as to whether the\nsound of persons moving [inside the apartment] was sufficient to\nestablish that evidence was being destroyed.\u201dId.,at 655.\nBut the court did not answer that question. Instead, it \u201cassume[d]\nfor the purpose of argument that exigent circumstances existed.\u201dIbid.To determine whether police impermissibly\ncreated the exigency, the Supreme Court of Kentucky announced a\ntwo-part test. First, the court held, police cannot \u201cdeliberately\ncreat[e] the exigent circumstances with the bad faith intent to\navoid the warrant requirement.\u201dId., at 656 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). Second, even absent bad faith, the court\nconcluded, police may not rely on exigent circumstances if \u201cit was\nreasonably foreseeable that the investigative tactics employed by\nthe police would create the exigent circumstances.\u201dIbid.(internal quotation marks omitted). Although the court found no\nevidence of bad faith, it held that exigent circumstances could not\njustify the search because it was reasonably foreseeable that the\noccupants would destroy evidence when the police knocked on the\ndoor and announced their presence.Ibid.We granted certiorari. 561 U. S. ___\n(2010).[Footnote 2]IIAThe Fourth Amendment\nprovides:\u201cThe right of the people to be\nsecure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against\nunreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no\nWarrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or\naffirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched,\nand the persons or things to be seized.\u201dThe text of the Amendment thus\nexpressly imposes two requirements. First, all searches and\nseizures must be reasonable. Second, a warrant may not be issued\nunless probable cause is properly established and the scope of the\nauthorized search is set out with particularity. SeePaytonv.New York,445 U. S. 573, 584\n(1980).Although the text of the Fourth Amendment does\nnot specify when a search warrant must be obtained, this Court has\ninferred that a warrant must generally be secured. \u201cIt is a \u2018basic\nprinciple of Fourth Amendment law,\u2019\u00a0\u201d we have often said,\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018that searches and seizures inside a home without a warrant\nare presumptively unreasonable.\u2019\u00a0\u201dBrigham Cityv.Stuart,547\nU. S. 398, 403 (2006) (quotingGrohv.Ramirez,540 U. S. 551, 559\n(2004)). But we have also recognized that this presumption may be\novercome in some circumstances because \u201c[t]he ultimate touchstone\nof the Fourth Amendment is \u2018reasonableness.\u2019\u00a0\u201dBrigham\nCity,supra,at 403; see alsoMichiganv.Fisher, 558 U. S. ___, ___ (2009)(per curiam)(slip op., at 2). Accordingly, the warrant requirement is subject\nto certain reasonable exceptions.Brigham City,supra, at 403.One well-recognized exception applies when\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018the exigencies of the situation\u2019 make the needs of law\nen-forcement so compelling that [a] warrantless search is\nobjectively reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.\u201dMinceyv.Arizona,437 U. S. 385, 394\n(1978); see alsoPayton,supra,at 590 (\u201c[T]he\nFourth Amendment has drawn a firm line at the entrance to the\nhouse. Absent exigent circumstances, that threshold may not\nreasonably be crossed without a warrant\u201d).This Court has identified several exigencies\nthat may justify a warrantless search of a home. SeeBrigham\nCity, 547 U. S., at 403. Under the \u201cemergency aid\u201d exception,\nfor example, \u201cofficers may enter a home without a warrant to render\nemergency assistance to an injured occupant or to protect an\noccupant from imminent injury.\u201dIbid.;see also,e.g.,\nFisher,supra,at ___ (slip op., at 5) (upholding\nwarrantless home entry based on emergency aid exception). Police\nofficers may enter premises without a warrant when they are in hot\npursuit of a fleeing suspect. SeeUnited Statesv.Santana,427\nU. S. 38, 42\u201343 (1976). And\u2014what is relevant here\u2014the need \u201cto\nprevent the imminent destruction of evidence\u201d has long been\nrecognized as a sufficient justification for a warrantless search.Brigham City,supra,at 403; see alsoGeorgiav.Randolph,547 U. S. 103, 116,\nn.\u00a06 (2006);Minnesotav.Olson,495 U. S. 91, 100\n(1990).[Footnote 3]BOver the years, lower courts have\ndeveloped an exception to the exigent circumstances rule, the\nso-called \u201cpolice-created exigency\u201d doctrine. Under this doctrine,\npolice may not rely on the need to prevent destruction of evidence\nwhen that exigency was \u201ccreated\u201d or \u201cmanufactured\u201d by the conduct\nof the police. See,e.g.,United Statesv.Chambers, 395 F.\u00a03d 563, 566 (CA6 2005) (\u201c[F]or a\nwarrantless search to stand, law enforcement officers must be\nresponding to an unanticipated exigency rather than simply creating\nthe exigency for themselves\u201d);United Statesv.Gould, 364 F.\u00a03d 578, 590 (CA5 2004) (en banc)\n(\u201c[A]lthough exigent circumstances may justify a warrantless\nprobable cause entry into the home, they will not do so if the\nexigent circumstances were manufactured by the agents\u201d (internal\nquotation marks omitted)).In applying this exception for\nthe \u201ccreation\u201d or \u201cmanufacturing\u201d of an exigency by the police,\ncourts require something more than mere proof that fear of\ndetection by the police caused the destruction of evidence. An\nadditional showing is obviously needed because, as the Eighth\nCircuit has recognized, \u201cin some sense the police always create the\nexigent circumstances.\u201dUnited Statesv.Duchi,\n906 F.\u00a02d 1278, 1284 (CA8 1990). That is to say, in the vast\nmajority of cases in which evidence is destroyed by persons who are\nengaged in illegal conduct, the reason for the destruction is fear\nthat the evidence will fall into the hands of law enforcement.\nDestruction of evidence issues probably occur most frequently in\ndrug cases because drugs may be easily destroyed by flushing them\ndown a toilet or rinsing them down a drain. Persons in possession\nof valuable drugs are unlikely to destroy them unless they fear\ndiscovery by the police. Consequently, a rule that precludes the\npolice from making a warrantless entry to prevent the destruction\nof evidence whenever their conduct causes the exigency would\nunreasonably shrink the reach of this well-established exception to\nthe warrant requirement.Presumably for the purpose of avoiding such a\nresult, the lower courts have held that the police-created exigency\ndoctrine requires more than simple causation, but the lower courts\nhave not agreed on the test to be applied. Indeed, the petition in\nthis case maintains that \u201c[t]here are currently five different\ntests being used by the United States Courts of Appeals,\u201d Pet. for\nCert. 11, and that some state courts have crafted additional tests,id., at 19\u201320.IIIADespite the welter of tests\ndevised by the lower courts, the answer to the question presented\nin this case follows directly and clearly from the principle that\npermits warrantless searches in the first place. As previously\nnoted, warrantless searches are allowed when the circumstances make\nit reasonable, within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment, to\ndispense with the warrant requirement. Therefore, the answer to the\nquestion before us is that the exigent circumstances rule justifies\na warrantless search when the conduct of the police preceding the\nexigency is reasonable in the same sense. Where, as here, the\npolice did not create the exigency by engaging or threatening to\nengage in conduct that violates the Fourth Amendment, warrantless\nentry to prevent the destruction of evidence is reasonable and thus\nallowed.[Footnote 4]We have taken a similar approach\nin other cases involving warrantless searches. For example, we have\nheld that law enforcement officers may seize evidence in plain\nview, provided that they have not violated the Fourth Amendment in\narriving at the spot from which the observation of the evidence is\nmade. SeeHortonv.California,496 U. S. 128, 136\u2013140\n(1990). As we put it inHorton, \u201c[i]t is \u2026 an essential\npredicate to any valid warrantless seizure of incriminating\nevidence that the officer did not violate the Fourth Amendment in\narriving at the place from which the evidence could be plainly\nviewed.\u201dId.,at 136. So long as this prerequisite is\nsatisfied, however, it does not matter that the officer who makes\nthe observation may have gone to the spot from which the evidence\nwas seen with the hope of being able to view and seize the\nevidence. Seeid.,at 138 (\u201cThe fact that an officer is\ninterested in an item of evidence and fully expects to find it in\nthe course of a search should not invalidate its seizure\u201d).\nInstead, the Fourth Amendment requires only that the steps\npreceding the seizure be lawful. Seeid.,at 136\u2013137.Similarly, officers may seek consent-based\nencounters if they are lawfully present in the place where the\nconsensual encounter occurs. SeeINSv.Delgado,466 U. S. 210,\n217, n.\u00a05 (1984) (noting that officers who entered into\nconsent-based encounters with employees in a factory building were\n\u201clawfully present [in the factory] pursuant to consent or a\nwarrant\u201d). If consent is freely given, it makes no difference that\nan officer may have approached the person with the hope or\nexpectation of obtaining consent. Seeid.,at 216 (\u201cWhile\nmost citizens will respond to a police request, the fact that\npeople do so, and do so without being told they are free not to\nrespond, hardly eliminates the consensual nature of the\nresponse\u201d).BSome lower courts have adopted a\nrule that is similar to the one that we recognize today. SeeUnited Statesv.MacDonald, 916 F.\u00a02d 766,\n772 (CA2 1990) (en banc) (law enforcement officers \u201cdo not\nimpermissibly create exigent circumstances\u201d when they \u201cact in an\nentirely lawful manner\u201d);Statev.Robinson, 2010\nWI 80, \u00b632, 327 Wis. 2d 302, 326\u2013328, 786 N.\u00a0W.\u00a02d 463,\n475\u2013476 (2010). But others, including the Kentucky Supreme Court,\nhave imposed additional requirements that are unsound and that we\nnow reject.Bad faith. Some courts,\nincluding the Kentucky Supreme Court, ask whether law enforcement\nofficers \u201c\u00a0\u2018deliberately created the exigent circumstances\nwith the bad faith intent to avoid the warrant requirement.\u2019\u00a0\u201d\n302 S.\u00a0W. 3d, at 656 (quotingGould, 364 F.\u00a03d,\nat 590); see also,e.g.,Chambers, 395\nF.\u00a03d, at 566;United Statesv.Socey, 846\nF.\u00a02d 1439, 1448 (CADC 1988);United Statesv.Rengifo, 858 F.\u00a02d 800, 804 (CA1 1988).This approach is fundamentally inconsistent\nwith our Fourth Amendment jurisprudence. \u201cOur cases have repeatedly\nrejected\u201d a subjective approach, asking only whether \u201cthe\ncircumstances, viewedobjectively, justify the action.\u201d\u2019Brigham City, 547 U. S., at 404 (alteration and internal\nquotation marks omitted); see alsoFisher, 558 U. S., at\n___ (slip op., at 3\u20135). Indeed, we have never held, outside limited\ncontexts such as an \u201cinventory search or administrative inspection\n\u2026\u00a0, that an officer\u2019s motive invalidates objectively\njustifiable behavior under the Fourth Amendment.\u201dWhrenv.United States,517 U. S. 806, 812\n(1996); see alsoBrigham City, supra,at 405.The reasons for looking to objective factors,\nrather than subjective intent, are clear. Legal tests based on\nreasonableness are generally objective, and this Court has long\ntaken the view that \u201cevenhanded law enforcement is best achieved by\nthe application of objective standards of conduct, rather than\nstandards that depend upon the subjective state of mind of the\nofficer.\u201dHorton,supra,at 138.Reasonable foreseeability. Some\ncourts, again including the Kentucky Supreme Court, hold that\npolice may not rely on an exigency if \u201c\u00a0\u2018it was reasonably\nforeseeable that the investigative tactics employed by the police\nwould create the exigent circumstances.\u2019\u00a0\u201d 302\nS.\u00a0W.\u00a03d, at 656 (quotingMannv.State, 357 Ark. 159, 172, 161 S.\u00a0W.\u00a03d 826, 834\n(2004)); see also,e.g.,United Statesv.Mowatt, 513 F.\u00a03d 395, 402 (CA4 2008). Courts\napplying this test have invalidated warrantless home searches on\nthe ground that it was reasonably foreseeable that police officers,\nby knocking on the door and announcing their presence, would lead a\ndrug suspect to destroy evidence. See,e.g.,id.,\nat 402\u2013403; 302 S.\u00a0W.\u00a03d, at 656.Contrary to this reasoning, however, we have\nrejected the notion that police may seize evidence without a\nwarrant only when they come across the evidence by happenstance. InHorton, as noted, we held that the police may seize\nevidence in plain view even though the officers may be \u201cinterested\nin an item of evidence and fully expec[t] to find it in the course\nof a search.\u201d 496 U. S., at 138.Adoption of a reasonable foreseeability test\nwould also introduce an unacceptable degree of unpredictability.\nFor example, whenever law enforcement officers knock on the door of\npremises occupied by a person who may be involved in the drug\ntrade, there issomepossibility that the occupants may\npossess drugs and may seek to destroy them. Under a reasonable\nforeseeability test, it would be necessary to quantify the degree\nof predictability that must be reached before the police-created\nexigency doctrine comes into play.A simple example illustrates the difficulties\nthat such an approach would produce. Suppose that the officers in\nthe present case did not smell marijuana smoke and thus knew only\nthat there was a 50% chance that the fleeing suspect had entered\nthe apartment on the left rather than the apartment on the right.\nUnder those circumstances, would it have been reasonably\nforeseeable that the occupants of the apartment on the left would\nseek to destroy evidence upon learning that the police were at the\ndoor? Or suppose that the officers knew only that the suspect had\ndisappeared into one of the apartments on a floor with 3, 5, 10, or\neven 20 units? If the police chose a door at random and knocked for\nthe purpose of asking the occupants if they knew a person who fit\nthe description of the suspect, would it have been reasonably\nforeseeable that the occupants would seek to destroy evidence?We have noted that \u201c[t]he calculus of\nreasonableness must embody allowance for the fact that police\nofficers are often forced to make split-second judgments\u2014in\ncircumstances that are tense, uncertain, and rapidly evolving.\u201dGrahamv.Connor,490 U. S. 386, 396\u2013397\n(1989). The reasonable foreseeability test would create\nunacceptable and unwarranted difficulties for law enforcement\nofficers who must make quick decisions in the field, as well as for\njudges who would be required to determine after the fact whether\nthe destruction of evidence in response to a knock on the door was\nreasonably foreseeable based on what the officers knew at the\ntime.Probable cause and time to secure a\nwarrant. Some courts, in applying the police-created exigency\ndoctrine, fault law enforcement officers if, after acquiring\nevidence that is sufficient to establish probable cause to search\nparticular premises, the officers do not seek a warrant but instead\nknock on the door and seek either to speak with an occupant or to\nobtain consent to search. See,e.g., Chambers,supra,at 569 (citing \u201c[t]he failure to seek a warrant in\nthe face of plentiful probable cause\u201d as a factor indicating that\nthe police deliberately created the exigency).This approach unjustifiably interferes with\nlegitimate law enforcement strategies. There are many entirely\nproper reasons why police may not want to seek a search warrant as\nsoon as the bare minimum of evidence needed to establish probable\ncause is acquired. Without attempting to provide a comprehensive\nlist of these reasons, we note a few.First, the police may wish to speak with the\noccupants of a dwelling before deciding whether it is worthwhile to\nseek authorization for a search. They may think that a short and\nsimple conversation may obviate the need to apply for and execute a\nwarrant. SeeSchnecklothv.Bustamonte,412 U. S. 218, 228\n(1973). Second, the police may want to ask an occupant of the\npremises for consent to search because doing so is simpler, faster,\nand less burdensome than applying for a warrant. A consensual\nsearch also \u201cmay result in considerably less inconvenience\u201d and\nembarrassment to the occupants than a search conducted pursuant to\na warrant.Ibid.Third, law enforcement officers may wish\nto obtain more evidence before submitting what might otherwise be\nconsidered a marginal warrant application. Fourth, prosecutors may\nwish to wait until they acquire evidence that can justify a search\nthat is broader in scope than the search that a judicial officer is\nlikely to authorize based on the evidence then available. And\nfinally, in many cases, law enforcement may not want to execute a\nsearch that will disclose the existence of an investigation because\ndoing so may interfere with the acquisition of additional evidence\nagainst those already under suspicion or evidence about additional\nbut as yet unknown participants in a criminal scheme.We have said that \u201c[l]aw enforcement officers\nare under no constitutional duty to call a halt to criminal\ninvestigation the moment they have the minimum evidence to\nestablish probable cause.\u201dHoffav.United\nStates,385 U.\nS. 293, 310 (1966). Faulting the police for failing to apply\nfor a search warrant at the earliest possible time after obtaining\nprobable cause imposes a duty that is nowhere to be found in the\nConstitution.Standard or good investigative\ntactics. Finally, some lower court cases suggest that law\nenforcement officers may be found to have created or manufactured\nan exigency if the court concludes that the course of their\ninvestigation was \u201ccontrary to standard or good law enforcement\npractices (or to the policies or practices of their\njurisdictions).\u201dGould, 364 F.\u00a03d, at 591. This\napproach fails to provide clear guidance for law enforcement\nofficers and authorizes courts to make judgments on matters that\nare the province of those who are responsible for federal and state\nlaw enforcement agencies.CRespondent argues for a rule that\ndiffers from those discussed above, but his rule is also flawed.\nRespondent contends that law enforcement officers impermissibly\ncreate an exigency when they \u201cengage in conduct that would cause a\nreasonable person to believe that entry is imminent and\ninevitable.\u201d Brief for Respondent 24. In respondent\u2019s view,\nrelevant factors include the officers\u2019 tone of voice in announcing\ntheir presence and the forcefulness of their knocks. But the\nability of law enforcement officers to respond to an exigency\ncannot turn on such subtleties.Police officers may have a very\ngood reason to announce their presence loudly and to knock on the\ndoor with some force. A forceful knock may be necessary to alert\nthe occupants that someone is at the door. Cf.United\nStatesv.Banks,540 U. S. 31, 33 (2003) (Police \u201crapped\nhard enough on the door to be heard by officers at the back door\u201d\nand announced their presence, but defendant \u201cwas in the shower and\ntestified that he heard nothing\u201d). Furthermore, unless police\nofficers identify themselves loudly enough, occupants may not know\nwho is at their doorstep. Officers are permitted\u2014indeed,\nencouraged\u2014to identify themselves to citizens, and \u201cin many\ncircumstances this is cause for assurance, not discomfort.\u201dUnited Statesv.Drayton,536 U. S. 194, 204\n(2002). Citizens who are startled by an unexpected knock on the\ndoor or by the sight of unknown persons in plain clothes on their\ndoorstep may be relieved to learn that these persons are police\nofficers. Others may appreciate the opportunity to make an informed\ndecision about whether to answer the door to the police.If respondent\u2019s test were adopted, it would be\nextremely difficult for police officers to know how loudly they may\nannounce their presence or how forcefully they may knock on a door\nwithout running afoul of the police-created exigency rule. And in\nmost cases, it would be nearly impossible for a court to determine\nwhether that threshold had been passed. The Fourth Amendment does\nnot require the nebulous and impractical test that respondent\nproposes.[Footnote 5]DFor these reasons, we conclude\nthat the exigent circumstances rule applies when the police do not\ngain entry to premises by means of an actual or threatened\nviolation of the Fourth Amendment. This holding provides ample\nprotection for the privacy rights that the Amendment protects.When law enforcement officers who\nare not armed with a warrant knock on a door, they do no more than\nany private citizen might do. And whether the person who knocks on\nthe door and requests the opportunity to speak is a police officer\nor a private citizen, the occupant has no obligation to open the\ndoor or to speak. Cf.Floridav.Royer,460 U. S. 491, 497\u2013498\n(1983). (\u201c[H]e may decline to listen to the questions at all and\nmay go on his way\u201d). When the police knock on a door but the\noccupants choose not to respond or to speak, \u201cthe investigation\nwill have reached a conspicuously low point,\u201d and the occupants\n\u201cwill have the kind of warning that even the most elaborate\nsecurity system cannot provide.\u201dChambers, 395 F.\u00a03d,\nat 577 (Sutton, J., dissenting). And even if an occupant chooses to\nopen the door and speak with the officers, the occupant need not\nallow the officers to enter the premises and may refuse to answer\nany questions at any time.Occupants who choose not to stand on their\nconstitutional rights but instead elect to attempt to destroy\nevidence have only themselves to blame for the warrantless\nexigent-circumstances search that may ensue.IVWe now apply our interpretation\nof the police-created exigency doctrine to the facts of this\ncase.AWe need not decide whether\nexigent circumstances existed in this case. Any warrantless entry\nbased on exigent circumstances must, of course, be supported by a\ngenuine exigency. SeeBrigham City, 547 U. S., at\n406.The trial court and the Kentucky Court of Appeals\nfound that there was a real exigency in this case, but the Kentucky\nSupreme Court expressed doubt on this issue, observing that there\nwas \u201ccertainly some question as to whether the sound of persons\nmoving [inside the apartment] was sufficient to establish that\nevidence was being destroyed.\u201d 302 S.\u00a0W.\u00a03d, at 655. The\nKentucky Supreme Court \u201cassum[ed] for the purpose of argument that\nexigent circumstances existed,\u201dibid.,and it held that\nthe police had impermissibly manufactured the exigency.We, too, assume for purposes of\nargument that an exigency existed. We decide only the question on\nwhich the Kentucky Supreme Court ruled and on which we granted\ncertiorari: Under what circumstances do police impermissibly create\nan exigency? Any question about whether an exigency actually\nexisted is better addressed by the Kentucky Supreme Court on\nremand. SeeKirkv.Louisiana,536 U. S. 635, 638\n(2002)(per curiam)(reversing state-court judgment that\nexigent circumstances were not required for warrantless home entry\nand remanding for state court to determine whether exigent\ncircumstances were present).BIn this case, we see no evidence\nthat the officers either violated the Fourth Amendment or\nthreatened to do so prior to the point when they entered the\napartment. Officer Cobb testified without contradiction that the\nofficers \u201cbanged on the door as loud as [they] could\u201d and announced\neither \u201c\u00a0\u2018Police, police, police\u2019\u00a0\u201d or \u201c\u00a0\u2018This is\nthe police.\u2019\u00a0\u201d App. 22\u201323. This conduct was entirely\nconsistent with the Fourth Amendment, and we are aware of no other\nevidence that might show that the officers either violated the\nFourth Amendment or threatened to do so (for example, by announcing\nthat they would break down the door if the occupants did not open\nthe door voluntarily).Respondent argues that the\nofficers \u201cdemanded\u201d entry to the apartment, but he has not pointed\nto any evidence in the record that supports this assertion. He\nrelies on a passing statement made by the trial court in its\nopinion denying respondent\u2019s motion to suppress. See App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 3a\u20134a. In recounting the events that preceded the search,\nthe judge wrote that the officers \u201cbanged on the door of the\napartment on the back left of the breezeway identifying themselves\nas police officers anddemandingthat the door be opened\nby the persons inside.\u201dIbid. (emphasis added and\ndeleted). However, at a later point in this opinion, the judge\nstated that the officers \u201cinitially knock[ed] on the door of the\napartment unit and await[ed] the response or consensual entry.\u201dId., at 9a. This later statement is consistent with the\ntestimony at the suppression hearing and with the findings of the\nstate appellate courts. See 302 S.\u00a0W.\u00a03d, at 651 (The\nofficers \u201cknocked loudly on the back left apartment door and\nannounced \u2018police\u2019\u00a0\u201d); App. to Pet. for Cert. 14a (The\nofficers \u201cknock[ed] on the door and announc[ed] themselves as\npolice\u201d); App. 22\u201324. There is no evidence of a \u201cdemand\u201d of any\nsort, much less a demand that amounts to a threat to violate the\nFourth Amendment. If there is contradictory evidence that has not\nbeen brought to our attention, the state court may elect to address\nthat matter on remand.Finally, respondent claims that the officers\n\u201cexplained to [the occupants that the officers] were going to make\nentry inside the apartment,\u201did.,at 24, but the record is\nclear that the officers did not make this statement until after the\nexigency arose. As Officer Cobb testified, the officers \u201cknew that\nthere was possibly something that was going to be destroyed inside\nthe apartment,\u201d and \u201c[a]t that point, \u2026 [they] explained \u2026\n[that they] were going to make entry.\u201dIbid.(emphasis\nadded). Given that this announcement was madeafterthe\nexigency arose, it could not have created the exigency.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*Like the court below, we assume\nfor purposes of argument that an exigency existed. Because the\nofficers in this case did not violate or threaten to violate the\nFourth Amendment prior to the exigency, we hold that the exigency\njustified the warrantless search of the apartment.The judgment of the Kentucky\nSupreme Court is reversed, and the case is remanded for further\nproceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.Footnote 1Respondent\u2019s girlfriend leased the apartment,\nbut respondent stayed there part of the time, and his child lived\nthere. Based on these facts, Kentucky conceded in state court that\nrespondent has Fourth Amendment standing to challenge the search.\nSee App. to Pet. for Cert. 7a; see also 302 S.\u00a0W.\u00a03d 649,\n652 (Ky. 2010).Footnote 2After we granted certiorari, respondent filed\na motion to dismiss the petition as improvidently granted, which we\ndenied. 562 U. S. ___ (2010). Respondent\u2019s principal argument was\nthat the case was moot because, after the Kentucky Supreme Court\nreversed his conviction, the Circuit Court dismissed the charges\nagainst him. Respondent\u2019s argument is foreclosed byUnited\nStatesv.Villamonte-Marquez,462 U. S. 579, 581,\nn.\u00a02 (1983). As we explained inVillamonte-Marquez,\nour reversal of the Kentucky Supreme Court\u2019s decision \u201cwould\nreinstate the judgment of conviction and the sentence entered\u201d by\nthe Circuit Court.Ibid.The absence of an indictment does\nnot change matters. Seeibid.(\u201cUpon respondents\u2019\nconviction and sentence, the indictment that was returned against\nthem was merged into their convictions and sentences\u201d).Footnote 3Preventing the destruction of evidence may\nalso justify dispensing with Fourth Amendment requirements in other\ncontexts. See,e.g., Richardsv.Wisconsin,520 U. S. 385,\n395\u2013396 (1997) (failure to comply with the knock-and-announce\nrequirement was justified because \u201cthe circumstances \u2026 show[ed]\nthat the officers had a reasonable suspicion that [a suspect] might\ndestroy evidence if given further opportunity to do so\u201d);Schmerberv.California,384 U. S. 757, 770\u2013771\n(1966) (warrantless testing for blood-alcohol content was justified\nbased on potential destruction of evidence); cf.United\nStatesv.Banks,540 U. S. 31, 37\u201340 (2003) (15 to 20\nseconds was a reasonable time for officers to wait after knocking\nand announcing their presence where there was a risk that suspect\nwould dispose of cocaine).Footnote 4There is a strong argument to be made that,\nat least in most circumstances, the exigent circumstances rule\nshould not apply where the police, without a warrant or any legally\nsound basis for a warrantless entry, threaten that they will enter\nwithout permission unless admitted. In this case, however, no such\nactual threat was made, and therefore we have no need to reach that\nquestion.Footnote 5Contrary to respondent\u2019s argument, see Brief\nfor Respondent 13\u201318,Johnsonv.United States,333 U. S. 10(1948), does not require affirmance in this case. InJohnson, officers noticed the smell of burning opium\nemanating from a hotel room. They then knocked on the door and\ndemanded entry. Upon seeing that Johnson was the only occupant of\nthe room, they placed her under arrest, searched the room, and\ndiscovered opium and drug paraphernalia.Id., at 11.Defending the legality of the search, the\nGovernment attempted to justify the warrantless search of the room\nas a valid search incident to a lawful arrest. See Brief for United\nStates inJohnsonv.United States, O.\u00a0T.\n1947, No. 329, pp.\u00a013, 16, 36. The Government did not contend\nthat the officers entered the room in order to prevent the\ndestruction of evidence. Although the officers said that they heard\na \u201c\u00a0\u2018shuffling\u2019\u00a0\u201d noise inside the room after they\nknocked on the door, 333 U. S., at 12, the Government did not claim\nthat this particular noise was a noise that would have led a\nreasonable officer to think that evidence was about to be\ndestroyed. Thus,Johnsonis simply not a case about\nexigent circumstances. Seeid., at 14\u201315 (noting that if\n\u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d existed\u2014for example, if a \u201csuspect was\nfleeing or likely to take flight\u201d or if \u201cevidence or contraband was\nthreatened with removal or destruction\u201d\u2014then \u201cit may be contended\nthat a magistrate\u2019s warrant for search may be dispensed with\u201d).",
