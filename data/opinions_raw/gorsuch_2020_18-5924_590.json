But not in\nLouisiana. Along with Oregon, Louisiana has long punished people\nbased on 10-to-2 verdicts like the one here. So instead of the\nmistrial he would have received almost anywhere else, Mr. Ramos was\nsentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.Why do Louisiana and Oregon allow nonunanimous\nconvictions? Though it\u2019s hard to say why these laws persist, their\norigins are clear. Louisiana first endorsed nonunanimous verdicts\nfor serious crimes at a constitutional convention in 1898.\nAccording to one committee chairman, the avowed purpose of that\nconvention was to \u201cestablish the supremacy of the white race,\u201d and\nthe resulting document included many of the trappings of the Jim\nCrow era: a poll tax, a combined literacy and property ownership\ntest, and a grandfather clause that in practice exempted white\nresidents from the most onerous of these requirements.[1]Nor was it only the prospect of\nAfrican-Americans voting that concerned the delegates. Just a week\nbefore the convention, the U. S. Senate passed a resolution calling\nfor an investigation into whether Louisiana was systemically\nexcluding African-Americans from juries.[2] Seeking to avoid unwanted national attention, and\naware that this Court would strike down any policy of overt\ndiscrimination against African-American jurors as a violation of\nthe Fourteenth Amendment,[3]\nthe delegates sought to undermine African-American participation on\njuries in another way. With a careful eye on racial demographics,\nthe convention delegates sculpted a \u201cfacially race-neutral\u201d rule\npermitting 10-to-2 verdicts in order \u201cto ensure that\nAfrican-American juror service would be meaningless.\u201d[4]Adopted in the 1930s, Oregon\u2019s rule permitting\nnonunanimous verdicts can be similarly traced to the rise of the Ku\nKlux Klan and efforts to dilute \u201cthe influence of racial, ethnic,\nand religious minorities on Oregon juries.\u201d[5] In fact, no one before us contests any of this;\ncourts in both Louisiana and Oregon have frankly acknowledged that\nrace was a motivating factor in the adoption of their States\u2019\nrespective nonunanimity rules.[6]We took this case to decide whether the Sixth\nAmendment right to a jury trial\u2014as incorporated against the States\nby way of the Fourteenth Amendment\u2014requires a unanimous verdict to\nconvict a defendant of a serious offense.[7] Louisiana insists that this Court has never\ndefinitively passed on the question and urges us to find its\npractice consistent with the Sixth Amendment. By contrast, the\ndissent doesn\u2019t try to defend Louisiana\u2019s law on Sixth or\nFourteenth Amendment grounds; tacitly, it seems to admit that the\nConstitution forbids States from using nonunanimous juries. Yet,\nunprompted by Louisiana, the dissent suggests our precedent\nrequires us to rule for the State anyway. What explains all this?\nTo answer the puzzle, it\u2019s necessary to say a bit more about the\nmerits of the question presented, the relevant precedent, and, at\nlast, the consequences that follow from saying what we know to be\ntrue.IThe Sixth Amendment promises that \u201c[i]n all\ncriminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a\nspeedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and\ndistrict wherein the crime shall have been committed, which\ndistrict shall have been previously ascertained by law.\u201d The\nAmendment goes on to preserve other rights for criminal defendants\nbut says nothing else about what a \u201ctrial by an impartial jury\u201d\nentails.Still, the promise of a jury trial surely meantsomething\u2014otherwise, there would have been no reason to\nwrite it down. Nor would it have made any sense to spell out the\nplaces from which jurors should be drawn if their powers as jurors\ncould be freely abridged by statute. Imagine a constitution that\nallowed a \u201cjury trial\u201d to mean nothing but a single person\nrubberstamping convictions without hearing any evidence\u2014but\nsimultaneously insisting that the lone juror come from a specific\njudicial district \u201cpreviously ascertained by law.\u201d And if that\u2019s\nnot enough, imagine a constitution that included the same hollow\nguaranteetwice\u2014not only in the Sixth Amendment, but also in\nArticle III.[8] No: The text\nand structure of the Constitution clearly suggest that the term\n\u201ctrial by an impartial jury\u201d carried with itsomemeaning\nabout the content and requirements of a jury trial.One of these requirements was unanimity.\nWherever we might look to determine what the term \u201ctrial by an\nimpartial jury trial\u201d meant at the time of the Sixth Amendment\u2019s\nadoption\u2014whether it\u2019s the common law, state practices in the\nfounding era, or opinions and treatises written soon afterward\u2014the\nanswer is unmistakable. A jury must reach a unanimous verdict in\norder to convict.The requirement of juror unanimity emerged in\n14th- century England and was soon accepted as a vital right\nprotected by the common law.[9]\nAs Blackstone explained, no person could be found guilty of a\nserious crime unless \u201cthe truth of every accusation .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nshould .\u00a0.\u00a0. be confirmed by the unanimous suffrage of\ntwelve of his equals and neighbors, indifferently chosen, and\nsuperior to all suspicion.\u201d[10] A \u201c\u00a0\u2018verdict, taken from eleven, was no\nverdict\u2019\u00a0\u201d at all.[11]This same rule applied in the young American\nStates. Six State Constitutions explicitly required\nunanimity.[12] Another four\npreserved the right to a jury trial in more general terms.[13] But the variations did not\nmatter much; consistent with the common law, state courts appeared\nto regard unanimity as an essential feature of the jury\ntrial.[14]It was against this backdrop that James Madison\ndrafted and the States ratified the Sixth Amendment in 1791. By\nthat time, unanimous verdicts had been required for about 400\nyears.[15] If the term\n\u201ctrial by an impartial jury\u201d carried any meaning at all, it surely\nincluded a requirement as long and widely accepted as\nunanimity.Influential, postadoption treatises confirm this\nunderstanding. For example, in 1824, Nathan Dane reported as fact\nthat the U.\u00a0S. Constitution required unanimity in criminal\njury trials for serious offenses.[16] A few years later, Justice Story explained in his\nCommentaries on the Constitution that \u201cin common cases, the law not\nonly presumes every man innocent, until he is proved guilty; but\nunanimity in the verdict of the jury is indispensable.\u201d[17] Similar statements can be found\nin American legal treatises throughout the 19th century.[18]Nor is this a case where the original public\nmeaning was lost to time and only recently recovered. This Court\nhas, repeatedly and over many years, recognized that the Sixth\nAmendment requires unanimity. As early as 1898, the Court said that\na defendant enjoys a \u201cconstitutional right to demand that his\nliberty should not be taken from him except by the joint action of\nthe court and the unanimous verdict of a jury of twelve\npersons.\u201d[19] A few decades\nlater, the Court elaborated that the Sixth Amendment affords a\nright to \u201ca trial by jury as understood and applied at common law,\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. includ[ing] all the essential elements as they were\nrecognized in this country and England when the Constitution was\nadopted.\u201d[20] And, the Court\nobserved, this includes a requirement \u201cthat the verdict should be\nunanimous.\u201d[21] In all, this\nCourt has commented on the Sixth Amendment\u2019s unanimity requirement\nno fewer than 13 times over more than 120 years.[22]There can be no question either that the Sixth\nAmendment\u2019s unanimity requirement applies to state and federal\ncriminal trials equally. This Court has long explained that the\nSixth Amendment right to a jury trial is \u201cfundamental to the\nAmerican scheme of justice\u201d and incorporated against the States\nunder the Fourteenth Amendment.[23] This Court has long explained, too, that incorporated\nprovisions of the Bill of Rights bear the same content when\nasserted against States as they do when asserted against the\nfederal government.[24] So\nif the Sixth Amendment\u2019s right to a jury trial requires a unanimous\nverdict to support a conviction in federal court, it requires no\nless in state court.IIAHow, despite these seemingly straightforward\nprinciples, have Louisiana\u2019s and Oregon\u2019s laws managed to hang on\nfor so long? It turns out that the Sixth Amendment\u2019s otherwise\nsimple story took a strange turn in 1972. That year, the Court\nconfronted these States\u2019 unconventional schemes for the first\ntime\u2014inApodacav.Oregon[25] and a companion case,Johnsonv.Louisiana.[26]\nUltimately, the Court could do no more than issue a badly fractured\nset of opinions. Four dissenting Justices would not have hesitated\nto strike down the States\u2019 laws, recognizing that the Sixth\nAmendment requires unanimity and that this guarantee is fully\napplicable against the States under the Fourteenth\nAmendment.[27] But a\nfour-Justice plurality took a very different view of the Sixth\nAmendment. These Justices declared that the real question before\nthem was whether unanimity serves an important \u201cfunction\u201d in\n\u201ccontemporary society.\u201d[28]\nThen, having reframed the question, the plurality wasted few words\nbefore concluding that unanimity\u2019s costs outweigh its benefits in\nthe modern era, so the Sixth Amendment should not stand in the way\nof Louisiana or Oregon.The ninth Member of the Court adopted a position\nthat was neither here nor there. On the one hand, Justice Powell\nagreed that, as a matter of \u201chistory and precedent, .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nthe Sixth Amendment requires a unanimous jury verdict to\nconvict.\u201d[29] But, on the\nother hand, he argued that the Fourteenth Amendment does not render\nthis guarantee against the federal government fully applicable\nagainst the States. In this way, Justice Powell doubled down on his\nbelief in \u201cdual-track\u201d incorporation\u2014the idea that a single right\ncan mean two different things depending on whether it is being\ninvoked against the federal or a state government.Justice Powell acknowledged that his argument\nfor dual-track incorporation came \u201clate in the day.\u201d[30] Late it was. The Court had already,\nnearly a decade earlier, \u201crejected the notion that the Fourteenth\nAmendment applies to the States only a \u2018watered-down, subjective\nversion of the individual guarantees of the Bill of\nRights.\u2019\u00a0\u201d[31] It\u2019s a\npoint we\u2019ve restated many times since, too, including as recently\nas last year.[32] Still,\nJustice Powell frankly explained, he was \u201cunwillin[g]\u201d to follow\nthe Court\u2019s precedents.[33]\nSo he offered up the essential fifth vote to uphold Mr. Apodaca\u2019s\nconviction\u2014if based only on a view of the Fourteenth Amendment that\nhe knew was (and remains) foreclosed by precedent.BIn the years followingApodaca, both\nLouisiana and Oregon chose to continue allowing nonunanimous\nverdicts. But their practices have always stood on shaky ground.\nAfter all, while Justice Powell\u2019s vote secured a favorable judgment\nfor the States inApodaca, it\u2019s never been clear what\nrationale could support a similar result in future cases. Only two\npossibilities exist: Either the Sixth Amendment allows nonunanimous\nverdicts, or the Sixth Amendment\u2019s guarantee of a jury trial\napplies with less force to the States under the Fourteenth\nAmendment. Yet, as we\u2019ve seen, both bear their problems. InApodacaitself, a majority of Justices\u2014including Justice\nPowell\u2014recognized that the Sixth Amendment demands unanimity, just\nas our cases have long said. And this Court\u2019s precedents, both then\nand now, prevent the Court from applying the Sixth Amendment to the\nStates in some mutated and diminished form under the Fourteenth\nAmendment. So what could we possibly describe as the \u201cholding\u201d ofApodaca?Really, no one has found a way to make sense of\nit. In later cases, this Court has labeledApodacaan\n\u201cexception,\u201d \u201cunusual,\u201d and in any event \u201cnot an endorsement\u201d of\nJustice Powell\u2019s view of incorporation.[34] At the same time, we have continued to recognize\nthe historical need for unanimity.[35] We\u2019ve been studiously ambiguous, even inconsistent,\nabout whatApodacamight mean.[36] To its credit, Louisiana acknowledges the problem.\nThe State expressly tells us it is not \u201casking the Court to accord\nJustice Powell\u2019s solo opinion inApodacaprecedential\nforce.\u201d[37] Instead, in an\neffort to win today\u2019s case, Louisiana embraces the idea that\neverything is up for grabs. It contends that this Court has never\ndefinitively ruled on the propriety of nonunanimous juries under\nthe Sixth Amendment\u2014and that we should use this case to hold for\nthe first time that nonunanimous juries are permissible in state\nand federal courts alike.IIILouisiana\u2019s approach may not be quite as tough\nas trying to defend Justice Powell\u2019s dual-track theory of\nincorporation, but it\u2019s pretty close. How does the State deal with\nthe fact this Court has said 13 times over 120 years that the Sixth\nAmendmentdoesrequire unanimity? Or the fact that five\nJustices inApodacasaid the same? The best the State can\noffer is to suggest that all these statements came in\ndicta.[38] But even\nsupposing (without granting) that Louisiana is right and it\u2019s dicta\nall the way down, why would the Court now walk away from many of\nits own statements about the Constitution\u2019s meaning? And what about\nthe prior 400 years of English and American cases requiring\nunanimity\u2014should we dismiss all those as dicta too?Sensibly, Louisiana doesn\u2019t dispute that the\ncommon law required unanimity. Instead, it argues that the drafting\nhistory of the Sixth Amendment reveals an intent by the framers to\nleave this particular feature behind. The State points to the fact\nthat Madison\u2019s proposal for the Sixth Amendment originally read:\n\u201cThe trial of all crimes .\u00a0.\u00a0. shall be by an impartial\njury of freeholders of the vicinage, with the requisite of\nunanimity for conviction, of the right of challenge, and other\naccustomed requisites.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d[39] Louisiana notes that the House of\nRepresentatives approved this text with minor modifications. Yet,\nthe State stresses, the Senate replaced \u201cimpartial jury of\nfreeholders of the vicinage\u201d with \u201cimpartial jury of the State and\ndistrict wherein the crime shall have been committed\u201d and also\nremoved the explicit references to unanimity, the right of\nchallenge, and \u201cother accustomed requisites.\u201d In light of these\nrevisions, Louisiana would have us infer an intent to abandon the\ncommon law\u2019s traditional unanimity requirement.But this snippet of drafting history could just\nas easily support the opposite inference. Maybe the Senate deleted\nthe language about unanimity, the right of challenge, and \u201cother\naccustomed prerequisites\u201d because all this was so plainly included\nin the promise of a \u201ctrial by an impartial jury\u201d that Senators\nconsidered the language surplusage. The truth is that we have\nlittle contemporaneous evidence shedding light on why the Senate\nacted as it did.[40] So\nrather than dwelling on text left on the cutting room floor, we are\nmuch better served by interpreting the language Congress retained\nand the States ratified. And, as we\u2019ve seen, at the time of the\nAmendment\u2019s adoption, the right to a jury trialmeanta\ntrial in which the jury renders a unanimous verdict.Further undermining Louisiana\u2019s inference about\nthe drafting history is the fact it proves too much. If the\nSenate\u2019s deletion of the word \u201cunanimity\u201d changed the meaning of\nthe text that remains, then the same would seemingly have to follow\nfor the other deleted words as well. So it\u2019s not just unanimity\nthat died in the Senate, but all the \u201cother accustomed requisites\u201d\nassociated with the common law jury trial right\u2014i.e.,everythinghistory might have taught us about what it means\nto have a jury trial. Taking the State\u2019s argument from drafting\nhistory to its logical conclusion would thus leave the right to a\n\u201ctrial by jury\u201d devoid of meaning. A right mentioned twice in the\nConstitution would be reduced to an empty promise. That can\u2019t be\nright.Faced with this hard fact, Louisiana\u2019s only\nremaining option is to invite us to distinguish between the\nhistoric features of common law jury trials that (we think) serve\n\u201cimportant enough\u201d functions to migrate silently into the Sixth\nAmendment and those that don\u2019t. And, on the State\u2019s account, we\nshould conclude that unanimity isn\u2019t worthy enough to make the\ntrip.But to see the dangers of Louisiana\u2019s overwise\napproach, there\u2019s no need to look any further thanApodacaitself. There, four Justices, pursuing the functionalist approach\nLouisiana espouses, began by describing the\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018essential\u2019\u00a0\u201d benefit of a jury trial as \u201c\u00a0\u2018the\ninterposition .\u00a0.\u00a0. of the commonsense judgment of a\ngroup of laymen\u2019\u00a0\u201d between the defendant and the possibility\nof an \u201c\u00a0\u2018overzealous prosecutor.\u2019\u00a0\u201d[41] And measured against that muddy yardstick,\nthey quickly concluded that requiring 12 rather than 10 votes to\nconvict offers no meaningful improvement.[42] Meanwhile, these Justices argued, States have good\nand important reasons for dispensing with unanimity, such as\nseeking to reduce the rate of hung juries.[43]Who can profess confidence in a breezy\ncost-benefit analysis like that? Lost in the accounting are the\nracially discriminatoryreasonsthat Louisiana and Oregon\nadopted their peculiar rules in the first place.[44] What\u2019s more, the plurality never\nexplained why the promised benefit of abandoning unanimity\u2014reducing\nthe rate of hung juries\u2014always scores as a credit, not a cost. But\nwho can say whether any particular hung jury is a waste, rather\nthan an example of a jury doing exactly what the plurality said it\nshould\u2014deliberating carefully and safeguarding against overzealous\nprosecutions? And what about the fact, too, that some studies\nsuggest that the elimination of unanimity has only a small effect\non the rate of hung juries?[45] Or the fact that others profess to have found that\nrequiring unanimity may provide other possible benefits, including\nmore open-minded and more thorough deliberations?[46] It seems theApodacaplurality\nnever even conceived of such possibilities.Our real objection here isn\u2019t that theApodacaplurality\u2019s cost-benefit analysis was too skimpy.\nThe deeper problem is that the plurality subjected the ancient\nguarantee of a unanimous jury verdict to its own functionalist\nassessment in the first place. And Louisiana asks us to repeat the\nerror today, just replacingApodaca\u2019s functionalist\nassessment with our own updated version. All this overlooks the\nfact that, at the time of the Sixth Amendment\u2019s adoption, the right\nto trial by juryincludeda right to a unanimous verdict.\nWhen the American people chose to enshrine that right in the\nConstitution, they weren\u2019t suggesting fruitful topics for future\ncost-benefit analyses. They were seeking to ensure that their\nchildren\u2019s children would enjoy the same hard-won liberty they\nenjoyed. As judges, it is not our role to reassess whether the\nright to a unanimous jury is \u201cimportant enough\u201d to retain. With\nhumility, we must accept that this right may serve purposes evading\nour current notice. We are entrusted to preserve and protect that\nliberty, not balance it away aided by no more than social\nstatistics.[47]IVAIf Louisiana\u2019s path to an affirmance is a\ndifficult one, the dissent\u2019s is trickier still. The dissent doesn\u2019t\ndispute that the Sixth Amendment protects the right to a unanimous\njury verdict, or that the Fourteenth Amendment extends this right\nto state-court trials. But, it insists, we must affirm Mr. Ramos\u2019s\nconviction anyway. Why? Because the doctrine ofstare\ndecisissupposedly commands it. There are two independent\nreasons why that answer falls short.In the first place and as we\u2019ve seen, not even\nLouisiana tries to suggest thatApodacasupplies a governing\nprecedent. Remember, Justice Powell agreed that the Sixth Amendment\nrequires a unanimous verdict to convict, so he would have no\nobjection to that aspect of our holding today. Justice Powell\nreached a different result only by relying on a dual-track theory\nof incorporation that a majority of the Court had already rejected\n(and continues to reject). And to acceptthatreasoning as\nprecedential, we would have to embrace a new and dubious\nproposition: that a single Justice writing only for himself has the\nauthority to bind this Court to propositions it has already\nrejected.This is not the rule, and for good reason\u2014it\nwould do more to destabilize than honor precedent. To see how,\nconsider a hypothetical. Suppose we face a question of first\nimpression under the Fourth Amendment: whether a State must obtain\na warrant before reading a citizen\u2019s email in the hands of an\nInternet provider and using that email as evidence in a criminal\ntrial. Imagine this question splits the Court, with four Justices\nfinding the Fourth Amendment requires a warrant and four Justices\nfinding no such requirement. The ninth Justice agrees that the\nFourth Amendment requires a warrant, but takes an idiosyncratic\nview of the consequences of violating that right. In her view, the\nexclusionary rule has gone too far, and should only apply when the\ndefendant is prosecuted for a felony. Because the case before her\nhappens to involve only a misdemeanor, she provides the ninth vote\nto affirm a conviction based on evidence secured by a warrantless\nsearch. Of course, this Court has longstanding precedent requiring\nthe suppression of all evidence obtained in unconstitutional\nsearches and seizures.Mappv.Ohio,367 U.S.\n643(1961). But like Justice Powell, our hypothetical ninth\nJustice sticks to her view and expressly rejects this Court\u2019s\nprecedent. Like Justice Powell, this Justice\u2019s vote would be\nessential to the judgment. So if, as the dissent suggests,thatis enough to displace precedent, wouldMapp\u2019s\nexclusionary rule now be limited to felony prosecutions?Admittedly, this example comes from our\nimagination. It has to, because no case has before suggested that a\nsingle Justice may overrule precedent. But if the Court were to\nembrace the dissent\u2019s view ofstare decisis, it would not\nstay imaginary for long. Every occasion on which the Court is\nevenly split would present an opportunity for single Justices to\noverturn precedent to bind future majorities. Rather than advancing\nthe goals of predictability and reliance lying behind the doctrine\nofstare decisis, such an approach would impair them.The dissent contends that, in saying this much,\nwe risk defyingMarksv.United States.[48] According toMarks, when\n\u201ca fragmented Court decides a case and no single rationale\nexplaining the result enjoys the assent of five Justices, \u2018the\nholding of the Court may be viewed as that position taken by those\nMembers who concurred in the judgments on the narrowest\ngrounds.\u2019\u00a0\u201d[49] But\nnotice that the dissent never actually gets around to telling us\nwhich opinion inApodacait considers to be the narrowest\nand controlling one underMarks\u2014or why. So while the dissent\nworries that we defy aMarksprecedent, it is oddly coy\nabout where exactly that precedent might be found.The parties recognize what the dissent does not:Markshas nothing to do with this case. Unlike aMarksdispute where the litigants duel over which opinion\nrepresents the narrowest and controlling one, the parties before us\naccept thatApodacayielded no controlling opinion at all.\nIn particular, both sides admit that Justice Powell\u2019s opinion\ncannot bind us\u2014precisely because he relied on a dual-track rule of\nincorporation that an unbroken line of majority opinions before and\nafterApodacahas rejected. Still, the dissent presses the\nissue, suggesting that a single Justice\u2019s opinioncanoverrule prior precedents under \u201cthe logic\u201d ofMarks.[50] But, as\nthe dissent itself implicitly acknowledges,Marksnever\nsought to offer or defend such a rule. And, as we have seen, too, a\nrule like that would do more to harm than advancestare\ndecisis.The dissent\u2019s backup argument fares no better.\nIn the end, even the dissent is forced to concede that Justice\nPowell\u2019sreasoninginApodacalacks controlling\nforce.[51] So far, so good.\nBut then the dissent suggestsApodacasomehow still manages\nto supply a controlling precedent as to itsresult.[52] Look closely, though. The\ndissent\u2019s account ofApodaca\u2019sresultlooks\nsuspiciously like thereasoningof Justice Powell\u2019s opinion:\n\u201cInApodaca,this means that when (1) a defendant is\nconvicted in state court, (2) at least 10 of the 12 jurors vote to\nconvict, and (3) the defendant argues that the conviction violates\nthe Constitution because the vote was not unanimous, the challenge\nfails.\u201d[53] Where does the\nconvenient \u201cstate court\u201d qualification come from? Neither theApodacaplurality nor the dissent included any limitation\nlike that\u2014their opinions turned on the meaning of the Sixth\nAmendment. What the dissent characterizes asApodaca\u2019s\nresult turns out to be nothing more than Justice Powell\u2019s reasoning\nabout dual-track incorporation dressed up to look like a logical\nproof.All of this does no more than highlight an old\ntruth. It is usually a judicial decision\u2019s reasoning\u2014itsratiodecidendi\u2014that allows it to have life and\neffect in the disposition of future cases.[54] As this Court has repeatedly explained in\nthe context of summary affirmances, \u201c\u00a0\u2018unexplicated\u2019\u00a0\u201d\ndecisions may \u201c\u00a0\u2018settl[e] the issues for the parties, [but\nthey are] not to be read as a renunciation by this Court of\ndoctrines previously announced in our opinions.\u2019\u00a0\u201d[55] Much the same may be said here.Apodaca\u2019s judgment line resolved that case for the parties\nin that case. It is binding in that sense. But stripped from any\nreasoning, its judgment alone cannot be read to repudiate this\nCourt\u2019s repeated pre-existing teachings on the Sixth and Fourteenth\nAmendments.[56]B1There\u2019s another obstacle the dissent must\novercome. Even if we accepted the premise thatApodacaestablished a precedent, no one on the Court today is prepared to\nsay it was rightly decided, andstare decisisisn\u2019t supposed\nto be the art of methodically ignoring what everyone knows to be\ntrue.[57] Of course, the\nprecedents of this Court warrant our deep respect as embodying the\nconsidered views of those who have come before. Butstare\ndecisishas never been treated as \u201can inexorable\ncommand.\u201d[58] And the\ndoctrine is \u201cat its weakest when we interpret the\nConstitution\u201d[59] because a\nmistaken judicial interpretation of that supreme law is often\n\u201cpractically impossible\u201d to correct through other means.[60] To balance these considerations,\nwhen it revisits a precedent this Court has traditionally\nconsidered \u201cthe quality of the decision\u2019s reasoning; its\nconsistency with related decisions; legal developments since the\ndecision; and reliance on the decision.\u201d[61] In this case, each factor points in the same\ndirection.Start with the quality of the reasoning. Whether\nwe look to the plurality opinion or Justice Powell\u2019s separate\nconcurrence,Apodacawas gravely mistaken; again, no Member\nof the Court today defends either as rightly decided. Without\nrepeating what we\u2019ve already explained in detail, it\u2019s just an\nimplacable fact that the plurality spent almost no time grappling\nwith the historical meaning of the Sixth Amendment\u2019s jury trial\nright, this Court\u2019s long-repeated statements that it demands\nunanimity, or the racist origins of Louisiana\u2019s and Oregon\u2019s laws.\nInstead, the plurality subjected the Constitution\u2019s jury trial\nright to an incomplete functionalist analysis of its own creation\nfor which it spared one paragraph. And, of course, five Justices\nexpressly rejected the plurality\u2019s conclusion that the Sixth\nAmendment does not require unanimity. Meanwhile, Justice Powell\nrefused to follow this Court\u2019s incorporation precedents. Nine\nJustices (including Justice Powell) recognized this for what it\nwas; eight called it an error.Looking toApodaca\u2019s consistency with\nrelated decisions and recent legal developments compounds the\nreasons for concern.Apodacasits uneasily with 120 years of\npreceding case law. Given how unmoored it was from the start, it\nmight seem unlikely that later developments could have done more to\nundermine the decision. Yet they have. While Justice Powell\u2019s\ndual-track theory of incorporation was already foreclosed in 1972,\nsome at that time still argued that it might have a role to play\noutside the realm of criminal procedure. Since then, the Court has\nheld otherwise.[62] Until\nrecently, dual-track incorporation attracted at least a measure of\nsupport in dissent. But this Court has now roundly rejected\nit.[63] Nor has the\nplurality\u2019s rejection of the Sixth Amendment\u2019s historical unanimity\nrequirement aged more gracefully. As we\u2019ve seen, in the years sinceApodaca, this Court has spoken inconsistently about its\nmeaning\u2014but nonetheless referred to the traditional unanimity\nrequirement on at least eight occasions.[64] In light of all this, callingApodacaan\noutlier would be perhaps too suggestive of the possibility of\ncompany.When it comes to reliance interests, it\u2019s\nnotable that neither Louisiana nor Oregon claims anything like the\nprospective economic, regulatory, or social disruption litigants\nseeking to preserve precedent usually invoke. No one, it seems, has\nsigned a contract, entered a marriage, purchased a home, or opened\na business based on the expectation that, should a crime occur, at\nleast the accused may be sent away by a 10-to-2 verdict.[65] Nor does anyone suggest that\nnonunanimous verdicts have \u201cbecome part of our national\nculture.\u201d[66] It would be\nquite surprising if they had, given that nonunanimous verdicts are\ninsufficient to convict in 48 States and federal court.Instead, the only reliance interests that might\nbe asserted here fall into two categories. The first concerns the\nfact Louisiana and Oregon may need to retry defendants convicted of\nfelonies by nonunanimous verdicts whose cases are still pending on\ndirect appeal. The dissent claims that this fact supplies the\nwinning argument for retainingApodacabecause it has\ngenerated \u201cenormous reliance interests\u201d and overturning the case\nwould provoke a \u201ccrushing\u201d \u201ctsunami\u201d of follow-on\nlitigation.[67]The overstatement may be forgiven as intended\nfor dramatic effect, but prior convictions in only two States are\npotentially affected by our judgment. Those States credibly claim\nthat the number of nonunanimous felony convictions still on direct\nappeal are somewhere in the hundreds,[68] and retrying or plea bargaining these cases will\nsurely impose a cost. But new rules of criminal procedures usually\ndo, often affecting significant numbers of pending cases across the\nwhole country. For example, afterBookerv.United\nStatesheld that the Federal Sentencing Guidelines must be\nadvisory rather than mandatory, this Court vacated and remanded\nnearly 800 decisions to the courts of appeals. Similar consequences\nlikely followed whenCrawfordv.Washingtonoverturned prior interpretations of the Confrontation\nClause[69] orArizonav.Gantchanged the law for searches incident to\narrests.[70] Our decision\nhere promises to cause less, and certainly nothing before us\nsupports the dissent\u2019s surmise that it will cause wildly more,\ndisruption than these other decisions.2The second and related reliance interest the\ndissent seizes upon involves the interest Louisiana and Oregon have\nin the security of their final criminal judgments. In light of our\ndecision today, the dissent worries that defendants whose appeals\nare already complete might seek to challenge their nonunanimous\nconvictions through collateral (i.e.,habeas) review.But again the worries outstrip the facts. UnderTeaguev.Lane, newly recognized rules of criminal\nprocedure do not normally apply in collateral review.[71] True,Teagueleft open\nthe possibility of an exception for \u201cwatershed rules\u201d\n\u201cimplicat[ing] the fundamental fairness [and accuracy] of the\ntrial.\u201d[72] But, as this\nlanguage suggests,Teague\u2019s test is a demanding one, so much\nso that this Court has yet to announce a new rule of criminal\nprocedure capable of meeting it.[73] And the test is demanding by design, expressly\ncalibrated to address the reliance interests States have in the\nfinality of their criminal judgments.[74]Nor is theTeaguequestion even before\nus. Whether the right to jury unanimity applies to cases on\ncollateral review is a question for a future case where the parties\nwill have a chance to brief the issue and we will benefit from\ntheir adversarial presentation. That litigation is sure to come,\nand will rightly take into account the States\u2019 interest in the\nfinality of their criminal convictions. In this way,Teaguefrees us to say what we know to be true about the rights of the\naccused under our Constitution today, while leaving questions about\nthe reliance interest States possess in their final judgments for\nlater proceedings crafted to account for them. It would hardly make\nsense to ignore that two-step process and count the State\u2019s\nreliance interests in final judgments both here and again there.\nCertainly the dissent cites no authority for such double\ncounting.Instead, the dissent suggests that the feeble\nreliance interests it identifies should get a boost because the\nright to a unanimous jury trial has \u201clittle practical importance\ngoing forward.\u201d[75] In the\ndissent\u2019s telling, Louisiana has \u201cabolished\u201d nonunanimous verdicts\nand Oregon \u201cseemed on the verge of doing the same until the Court\nintervened.\u201d[76] But, as the\ndissent itself concedes, a ruling for Louisiana would invite other\nStates to relax their own unanimity requirements.[77] In fact, 14 jurisdictions have already\ntold us that they would value the right to \u201cexperiment\u201d with\nnonunanimous juries.[78]\nBesides, Louisiana\u2019s law bears only prospective effect, so the\nState continues to allow nonunanimous verdicts for crimes committed\nbefore 2019.[79] And while\nthe dissent speculates that our grant of certiorari contributed to\nthe failure of legal reform efforts in Oregon, its citation does\nnot support its surmise. No doubt, too, those who risk being\nsubjected to nonunanimous juries in Louisiana and Oregon today, and\nelsewhere tomorrow, would dispute the dissent\u2019s suggestion that\ntheir Sixth Amendment rights are of \u201clittle practical\nimportance.\u201dThat point suggests another. In its valiant\nsearch for reliance interests, the dissent somehow misses maybe the\nmost important one: the reliance interests of the American people.\nTaken at its word, the dissent would have us discard a Sixth\nAmendment right in perpetuity rather than ask two States to retry a\nslice of their prior criminal cases. Whether that slice turns out\nto be large or small, it cannot outweigh the interest we all share\nin the preservation of our constitutionally promised liberties.\nIndeed, the dissent can cite no case in which the one-time need to\nretry defendants haseverbeen sufficient to inter a\nconstitutional right forever.In the final accounting, the dissent\u2019sstare\ndecisisarguments round to zero. We have an admittedly mistaken\ndecision, on a constitutional issue, an outlier on the day it was\ndecided, one that\u2019s become lonelier with time. In arguing\notherwise, the dissent must elide the reliance the American people\nplace in their constitutionally protected liberties, overplay the\ncompeting interests of two States, count some of those interests\ntwice, and make no small amount of new precedent all its own.VOn what ground would anyone have us leave Mr.\nRamos in prison for the rest of his life? Not a single Member of\nthis Court is prepared to say Louisiana secured his conviction\nconstitutionally under the Sixth Amendment. No one before us\nsuggests that the error was harmless. Louisiana does not claim\nprecedent commands an affirmance. In the end, the best anyone can\nseem to muster against Mr. Ramos is that, if we dared to admit in\nhis case what we all know to be true about the Sixth Amendment, we\nmight have to say the same in some others. But where is the justice\nin that? Every judge must learn to live with the fact he or she\nwill make some mistakes; it comes with the territory. But it is\nsomething else entirely to perpetuate something we all know to be\nwrong only because we fear the consequences of being right.

For\nexample, whileThompsonwas quick to say that the U.\u00a0S.\nConstitution requires \u201cthe unanimous verdict of a jury of twelve\npersons,\u201d the question before the Court was whether, in the\ncircumstances of the defendant\u2019s case, a trial by eight jurors in a\nUtah state court would violate theEx Post FactoClause. 170\nU.\u00a0S., at 351.

But we hardly needApodaca\u2019s\nfunctionalism to avoid repeating that wrong. Unlike the rule of\nunanimity, rules about who qualified as a defendant\u2019s \u201cpeer\u201d varied\nconsiderably at common law at the time of the Sixth Amendment\u2019s\nadoption. Reflecting that fact, the Judiciary Act of 1789\u2014adopted\nby the same Congress that passed the Sixth Amendment\u2014initially\npegged the qualifications for federal jury service to the relevant\nstate jury qualification requirements. 1Stat. 88. As a result, for\nmuch of this Nation\u2019s early history the composition of federal\njuries varied both geographically and over time. See Hickey,\nFederal Legislation: Improvement of the Jury System in Federal\nCourts, 35 Geo. L. J. 500, 506\u2013507 (1947);Taylorv.Louisiana,419 U.S.\n522, 536 (1975). Ultimately, however, the people themselves\nadopted further constitutional amendments that prohibit invidious\ndiscrimination. So today the Sixth Amendment\u2019s promise of a jury of\none\u2019s peers means a jury selected from a representative\ncross-section of the entire community.
