I write\nseparately to explain that, in my view, the Court\u2019s precedent inNLRBv.Babcock & Wilcox Co.,351 U.S.\n105(1956), also strongly supports today\u2019s decision.InBabcock, the National Labor Relations\nBoard argued that the National Labor Relations Act afforded union\norganizers a right to enter company property to communicate with\nemployees. Several employers responded that the Board\u2019s reading of\nthe Act would infringe their Fifth Amendment property rights. The\nemployers contended that Congress, \u201ceven if it could\nconstitutionally do so, has at no time shown any intention of\ndestroying property rights secured by theFifth Amendment,\nin protecting employees\u2019 rights of collective bargaining under the\nAct. Until Congress should evidence such intention by specific\nlegislative language, our courts should not construe the Act on\nsuch dangerous constitutional grounds.\u201d Brief for Respondent inNLRBv.Babcock & Wilcox Co., O.\u00a0T. 1955,\nNo. 250, pp.\u00a018\u201319.This Court agreed with the employers\u2019 argument\nthat the Act should be interpreted to avoid unconstitutionality.\nThe Court reasoned that \u201cthe National Government\u201d via the\nConstitution \u201cpreserves property rights,\u201d including \u201cthe right to\nexclude from property.\u201dBabcock, 351 U.\u00a0S., at 112.\nAgainst the backdrop of the Constitution\u2019s strong protection of\nproperty rights, the Court interpreted the Act to afford access to\nunion organizers only when \u201cneeded,\u201dibid.\u2014that is, when the\nemployees live on company property and union organizers have no\nother reasonable means of communicating with the employees,id.,at 113. See alsoLechmere,Inc.v.NLRB,502 U.S.\n527, 540\u2013541 (1992). As I read it,Babcockrecognized\nthat employers have a basic Fifth Amendment right to exclude from\ntheir private property, subject to a \u201cnecessity\u201d exception similar\nto that noted by the Court today.Ante, at 19.Babcockstrongly supports the growers\u2019\nposition in today\u2019s case because the California union access\nregulation intrudes on the growers\u2019 property rights far more thanBabcockallows. When this same California union access\nregulation was challenged on constitutional grounds before the\nCalifornia Supreme Court in 1976, that court upheld the regulation\nby a 4-to-3 vote.Agricultural Labor Rel. Bd.v.Superior\nCt. of Tulare Cty.,16 Cal. 3d 392, 546 P.2d 687. Justice William Clark wrote the\ndissent. Justice Clark stressed that \u201cproperty rights are\nfundamental.\u201dId., at 429, n.\u00a04, 546 P.\u00a02d, at\n712, n.\u00a04. And he concluded that the California union access\nregulation \u201cviolates the rule\u201d ofBabcockand thus \u201cviolates\nthe constitutional provisions protecting private property.\u201d 16 Cal.\n3d, at 431, 546 P.\u00a02d, at 713. In my view, Justice Clark had\nit exactly right.With those comments, I join the Court\u2019s opinion\nin full.",
