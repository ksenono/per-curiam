In all three episodes, with the\nAffordable Care Act facing a serious threat, the Court has pulled\noff an improbable rescue.In the opening installment,National\nFederation of Independent Businessv.Sebelius,567 U.S.\n519(2012) (NFIB), the Court saved the so-called\n\u201cindividual mandate,\u201d the same critical provision at issue in\ntoday\u2019s suit. At that time, the individual mandate imposed a\n\u201cpenalty\u201d on most Americans who refused to purchase health\ninsurance or enroll in Medicaid, see 26 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a75000A\n(2012 ed.), and it was widely thought that without the mandate much\nof the Act\u2014and perhaps even the whole scheme\u2014would collapse. The\nGovernment\u2019s principal defense of the mandate was that it\nrepresented a lawful exercise of Congress\u2019s power to regulate\ninterstate commerce, see U.\u00a0S. Const., Art. I, \u00a78, cl.\u00a03,\nbut the Court rejected that unprecedented argument, see 567\nU.\u00a0S., at 572 (opinion of the Court);id., at 561\n(opinion of Roberts, C.\u00a0J.);id., at 648 (joint dissent\nof Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas, and Alito, JJ.). That might have\nforetold doom, but then, in a stunning turn of events, the threat\nto the ACA was defused when the \u201cpenalty\u201d for failing to comply\nwith the mandate was found to be a \u201ctax\u201d and thus to be justified\nas an exercise of Congress\u2019s taxing power.Id., at 575\n(opinion of Roberts, C.\u00a0J.); see alsoid., at 574\n(opinion of the Court); see U.\u00a0S. Const., Art. I, \u00a78,\ncl.\u00a01. By a vote of 5 to 4, the individual mandate\u2014and with it\nthe rest of the ACA\u2014lived on.In the next installment,Kingv.Burwell, 576 U.S. 473 (2015), the Court carried out an\nequally impressive rescue. One of the Act\u2019s key provisions provided\nsubsidies to persons purchasing insurance through exchanges\nestablished by a \u201cState.\u201d 26 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a736B(b)\u2013(c) (2012\ned.). When many States refused to establish such exchanges, the\nFederal Government did so instead. But the critical subsidies were\nseemingly unavailable on those exchanges, which had not been\nestablished by a \u201cState\u201d in any conventional sense of the term.\nOnce again, some feared that the Act was in mortal danger, but the\nCourt came to the rescue by finding that the Federal Government is\na \u201cState.\u201d 576 U.\u00a0S., at 484\u2013498.Now, in the trilogy\u2019s third episode, the Court\nis presented with the daunting problem of a \u201ctax\u201d that does not\ntax. Can the taxing power, which saved the day in the first\nepisode, sustain such a curious creature? In 2017, Congress reduced\nthe \u201ctax\u201d imposed on Americans who failed to abide by the\nindividual mandate to $0. With that move, the slender reed that\nsupported the decision inNFIBwas seemingly cut down, but\nonce again the Court has found a way to protect the ACA. Instead of\ndefending the constitutionality of the individual mandate, the\nCourt simply ducks the issue and holds that none of the Act\u2019s\nchallengers, including the 18 States that think the Act saddles\nthem with huge financial costs, is entitled to sue.Can this be correct? The ACA imposes many\nburdensome obligations on States in their capacity as employers,\nand the 18 States in question collectively have more than a million\nemployees.[1] Even $1 in harm\nis enough to support standing. Yet no State has standing?In prior cases, the Court has been selectively\ngenerous in allowing States to sue. Just recently, New York and\ncertain other States were permitted to challenge the inclusion of a\ncitizenship question in the 2020 census even though any effect on\nthem depended on a speculative chain of events. SeeDepartment\nof Commercev.New York, 588 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___\u2013___\n(2019) (slip op., at 9\u201311). The States\u2019 theory was that the\ncitizenship question might cause some residents to violate their\nobligation to complete a census questionnaire and that this, in\nturn, might decrease the States\u2019 allocation of House seats and\ntheir share of federal funds.Id.,at ___ (slip op., at\n9).Last Term, Pennsylvania and New Jersey were\npermitted to contest a rule exempting the Little Sisters of the\nPoor and other religious employers from the ACA\u2019s contraceptive\nmandate.Little Sisters of the Poor Saints Peter and Paul\nHomev.Pennsylvania, 591 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2020). There,\nthe theory was that some affected employees might not be able to\nafford contraceptives and might therefore turn to state-funded\nsources to pay for their contraceptives or the expenses of an\nunwanted pregnancy.[2] Some\nyears ago, Massachusetts was allowed to sue (and force the\nEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA) to regulate greenhouse gases)\non the theory that failure to do so would cause the ocean to rise\nand reduce the size of the Commonwealth. SeeMassachusettsv.EPA,549 U.S.\n497, 521\u2013526 (2007). On the other hand, when Texas recently\ntried to sue to press different legal issues in an original action,\nthe Court would not even allow it to file its complaint. SeeTexasv.California,post,p. ___ (Alito, J.,\ndissenting).In this suit, as I will explain, Texas and the\nother state plaintiffs have standing, and now that the \u201ctax\u201d\nimposed by the individual mandate is set at $0, the mandate cannot\nbe sustained under the taxing power. As a result, it is clearly\nunconstitutional, and to the extent that the provisions of the ACA\nthat burden the States are inextricably linked to the individual\nmandate, they too are unenforceable.IAThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act\n(ACA), 124Stat. 119, comprehensively reengineered our country\u2019s\nhealthcare laws. The Act itself totals 906 pages, and thousands of\npages of regulations have been issued to implement it. At its core,\nthe ACA includes a series of \u201cclosely interrelated\u201d provisions,NFIB, 567 U.\u00a0S., at 691 (joint dissent), that impose a\nbevy of new legal obligations on individuals, insurers, employers,\nand States.A critical component of the Act\u2019s design was the\nindividual mandate, which provides that each \u201capplicable individual\nshall .\u00a0.\u00a0. ensure that the individual .\u00a0.\u00a0. is\ncovered under minimum essential coverage.\u201d 26 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a75000A(a). Originally, most individuals who were subject to but\ndisobeyed this command were liable for what the Act called a\n\u201c[s]hared responsibility payment\u201d or \u201cpenalty.\u201d \u00a75000A(b). The\nindividual mandate was \u201cclosely intertwined\u201d with other critical\nprovisions,King, 576 U.\u00a0S., at 482, including the\ncritical \u201cguaranteed issue\u201d and \u201ccommunity rating\u201d provisions,\nwhich ensured that individuals with preexisting medical conditions\nwould not be denied coverage or pay unusually high premiums. See,e.g.,42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a7300gg, 300gg\u20131(a). Put simply,\n\u201cCongress found that the guaranteed issue and community rating\nrequirements would not work without the\u201d individual mandate.King, 576 U.\u00a0S., at 482.Several additional features of the ACA are\nimportant in this suit. First, certain employers, including the\nstate plaintiffs, must offer employees the opportunity to enroll in\ncostly \u201cminimum essential [healthcare] coverage,\u201d and the Act\ndemands that such plans cover an employee\u2019s dependent children\nuntil they turn 26. 26 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a74980H; 42\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7300gg\u201314. Most employers that fail to offer\nthis coverage are subject to a hefty penalty of thousands of\ndollars per employee. 26 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a74980H(a), (b),\n(c)(1).The ACA also imposes burdensome reporting\nrequirements on certain employers like the state plaintiffs. See\n\u00a7\u00a76055, 6056. Under \u00a76055 of the Internal Revenue Code, employers\nthat \u201cprovid[e] minimum essential coverage\u201d must submit\ndocumentation every year to both the Internal Revenue Service and\nthe covered individuals. \u00a7\u00a76055(a)\u2013(c). Section 6056 imposes\nsimilar reporting obligations on \u201c[e]very applicable large\nemployer\u201d subject to the employer mandate. See \u00a7\u00a76056(a)\u2013(c).\nFailure to satisfy these reporting requirements can result in\nsubstantial monetary penalties. See \u00a7\u00a76721, 6722.BAlthough the ACA survived this Court\u2019s\ndecisions inNFIBandKing, it remained\ncontroversial, and in 2017, a major effort was made to repeal much\nof it. A bill to do just that passed the House of Representatives\nin May, but soon after failed in the Senate. See American Health\nCare Act of 2017, H.\u00a0R. 1628, 115th Cong., 1st Sess. (2017).\nLater that year, the two Chambers compromised in the Tax Cuts and\nJobs Act (TCJA), Pub. L. 115\u201397, 131Stat. 2054, which set the\namount of the \u201ctax\u201d imposed for noncompliance with the individual\nmandate at \u201c[z]ero percent\u201d and \u201c$0.\u201d \u00a711081, 131Stat. 2092\n(amending 26 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a75000A). What theNFIBCourt\nhad salvaged as a \u201ctax\u201d could now raise no revenue.CAfter the enactment of the TCJA, Texas and 17\nother States brought suit against the United States, the\nCommissioner of the IRS, the IRS, the Secretary of Health and Human\nServices, and the Department of Health and Human Services to\nchallenge the ACA.[3] The state\nplaintiffs identified many expenses imposed on them by the ACA, and\nthey sought declaratory and injunctive relief. In their view, the\nindividual mandate could no longer be sustained as a \u201ctax,\u201d and the\nremainder of the ACA was unenforceable because it was inseparable\nfrom that unconstitutional provision. Soon thereafter, two\nindividuals joined the States as plaintiffs. California, 15 other\nStates, and the District of Columbia intervened to defend the\nACA.[4] For its part, the\nFederal Government agreed that the individual mandate was\nunconstitutional but argued that it was severable from almost all\nother portions of the ACA.Ruling on what it construed as a plaintiffs\u2019\nmotion for partial summary judgment, the District Court declared\nthe entire ACA unlawful.Texasv.United States, 340\nF.\u00a0Supp. 3d 579, 619 (ND Tex. 2018). It held that the\nindividual plaintiffs had standing, that the individual mandate\ncould no longer be sustained as a lawful exercise of Congress\u2019s\ntaxing power, and that the mandate was inseverable from the\nremainder of the ACA, including the provisions that impose\nfinancial burdens on the state plaintiffs.Id.,at\n592\u2013619.On appeal, the Fifth Circuit affirmed in part\nand vacated in part.Texasv.United States, 945 F.3d\n355 (CA5 2019). It found that both the state plaintiffs and the\nindividual plaintiffs had standing, and it agreed with the District\nCourt that the individual mandate could no longer be sustained\nunder the taxing power. But the Court of Appeals remanded the case\nand directed the District Court to reassess the broad relief it had\nordered.The state intervenors then filed a petition for\na writ of certiorari seeking review of the Court of Appeals\u2019\ninterlocutory decision. The plaintiffs opposed interlocutory\nreview, but filed a conditional cross-petition asking us to review\nthe Court of Appeals\u2019 remand decision in the event that the Court\ngranted the state intervenors\u2019 petition. This Court granted both\npetitions. 589 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2020).IIWe may consider the merits of this appeal if\neven one plaintiff has standing,Little Sisters of the Poor,\n591 U.\u00a0S., at ___, n.\u00a06;Rumsfeldv.Forum for\nAcademic and Institutional Rights,Inc.,547 U.S.\n47, 52, n.\u00a02 (2006), but the majority concludes that no\nplaintiff\u2014neither the States that originally brought suit nor the\nindividual plaintiffs who later joined them\u2014has standing under\nArticle III of the Constitution. That is a remarkable holding.\nWhile the individual plaintiffs\u2019 claim to standing raises a novel\nquestion, the States have standing for reasons that are\nstraightforward and meritorious. The Court\u2019s contrary holding is\nbased on a fundamental distortion of our standing\njurisprudence.AThe governing rules are well-settled. To\nestablish Article III standing, a plaintiff must show: (1) \u201can\ninjury in fact\u201d; (2) that this injury \u201cis fairly traceable to the\nchallenged conduct of the defendant\u201d; and (3) that the injury \u201cis\nlikely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.\u201dSpokeo,Inc.v.Robins, 578 U.S. 330, 338\n(2016); see also,e.g.,Carneyv.Adams, 592\nU.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2020) (slip op., at 4);Hollingsworthv.Perry,570 U.S.\n693, 704 (2013);Lujanv.Defenders of Wildlife,504 U.S.\n555, 560\u2013561 (1992).In the present suit, there is no material\ndispute that the States have satisfied two of these requirements.\nFirst, there is no question that the States have demonstrated an\ninjury in fact. An injury in fact is \u201can invasion of a legally\nprotected interest that is concrete and particularized and actual\nor imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.\u201dSpokeo, 578\nU.\u00a0S., at 339 (internal quotation marks omitted). A financial\nor so-called \u201cpocketbook\u201d injury constitutes injury in fact, and\neven a small pocketbook injury\u2014like the loss of $1\u2014is enough. SeeCzyzewskiv.Jevic Holding Corp., 580 U.\u00a0S. ___,\n___ (2017) (slip op., at 11) (\u201cFor standing purposes, a loss of\neven a small amount of money is ordinarily an \u2018injury\u2019\u00a0\u201d).\nHere, the States have offered plenty of evidence that they incur\nsubstantial expenses in order to comply with obligations imposed by\nthe ACA.There is likewise no material dispute that these\nfinancial injuries could be redressed by a favorable judgment. The\nDistrict Court declared the entire ACA unenforceable, and that\njudgment, if sustained, would spare the States from the costs of\ncomplying with the ACA\u2019s provisions. So too would a more modest\njudgment limited to only those ACA provisions that directly burden\nthe States.The standing dispute in this suit thus turns on\ntraceability. Seeante, at 14\u201316. But once this requirement\nis properly understood, it is apparent that it too is met.Our cases explain that traceability requires \u201ca\ncausal connection between the injury andthe conduct complained\nof.\u201dLujan, 504 U.\u00a0S., at 560 (emphasis added). In\nother words, the injury has to be \u201c\u00a0\u2018fairly .\u00a0.\u00a0.\ntrace[able] tothe challenged action of the\ndefendant.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIbid.(quotingSimonv.Eastern Ky. Welfare Rights Organization,426 U.S.\n26, 41 (1976); emphasis added). We have repeatedly and\nconsistently described the traceability inquiry this way. SeeSpokeo, 578 U.\u00a0S., at 338 (\u201cThe plaintiff must have (1)\nsuffered an injury in fact, (2) that is fairly traceable to the\nchallenged conduct of the defendant\u201d);Heinv.Freedom\nFrom Religion Foundation,Inc.,551\nU.S. 587, 598 (2007) (plurality opinion) (\u201cA plaintiff must\nallege personal injury fairly traceable to the defendant\u2019s\nallegedly unlawful conduct\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted));DaimlerChrysler Corp.v.Cuno,547 U.S.\n332, 342 (2006) (\u201cA plaintiff must allege personal injury\nfairly traceable to the defendant\u2019s allegedly unlawful conduct\u201d\n(internal quotation marks omitted));Bennettv.Spear,520 U.S.\n154, 162 (1997) (requiring \u201cthat the injury is fairly traceable\nto the actions of the defendant\u201d (internal quotation marks\nomitted));Lujan, 504 U.\u00a0S., at 560 (requiring an\ninjury \u201cfairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant\u201d\n(internal quotation marks and alterations omitted));Allenv.Wright,468 U.S.\n737, 757 (1984) (requiring an injury \u201cfairly traceable to the\nGovernment conduct respondents challenge as unlawful\u201d).[5] Tracing injuries to particular\nconduct ensures that the properly adverse parties are before the\ncourt and reinforces the traditional understanding of legal\njudgments. SeeMassachusettsv.Mellon,262 U.S.\n447, 488 (1923) (\u201cIf a case for preventive relief be\npresented,\u201d what the court enjoins are \u201cthe acts of the official\u201d\ncharged with the law\u2019s enforcement).The States have clearly shown that they suffer\nconcrete and particularized financial injuries that are traceable\nto conduct of the Federal Government. The ACA saddles them with\nexpensive and burdensome obligations, and those obligations are\nenforced by the Federal Government. That is sufficient to establish\nstanding. As the Court observed inLujan, when a party is\n\u201can object of the action .\u00a0.\u00a0. at issue,\u201d \u201cthere is\nordinarily little question that the action .\u00a0.\u00a0. has\ncaused [that party] injury\u201d\u2014i.e., that the injury is\ntraceable to that action\u2014\u201cand that a judgment preventing\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. the action will redress it.\u201d 504 U.\u00a0S., at\n561\u2013562. That is precisely the situation here. The state plaintiffs\nhave shown that they are the object of potential federal\nenforcement actions if they do not comply with costly and\nburdensome obligations that the ACA imposes.Consider what the state plaintiffs have shown\nwith respect to the ACA reporting requirements codified at 26\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a76055 and 6056. These sections provide the\nbasis for the familiar 1094 and 1095 IRS tax forms. Section 6055\napplies to those who \u201cprovid[e] minimum essential coverage to an\nindividual during a calendar year.\u201d Subsection (a) of that\nprovision requires that returns be filed with the IRS, and\nsubsection (c) requires that similar forms be provided to covered\nindividuals. Section 6056 similarly requires certain large\nemployers to report to both the IRS and employees about whether\nthey offer health insurance coverage. The States plainly have\ndemonstrated standing to seek relief from these burdensome\nreporting obligations.Start with injury in fact. The States have\noffered undisputed evidence documenting the ongoing financial costs\nof complying with these reporting requirements. Missouri, for\nexample, offered a declaration attesting to spending $185,061 in\nfiscal year 2016 on Forms 1094 and 1095. App. 163. That declaration\nalso attested to costs or projected costs of more than $45,000 for\neach fiscal year from 2017 through 2021.Ibid.South Dakota\nprovided evidence of \u201congoing\u201d reporting costs totaling $100,000.Id., at 187. Kansas offered evidence of more than $100,000\nin reporting costs.Id., at 142. These are just a few\nexamples. See also,e.g.,id., at 103 (Texas);id., at 350\u2013351 (Georgia). There is no question that these\nundisputed, ongoing financial costs qualify as injuries in fact.\nSeeJevic Holding Corp., 580 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 11).Now turn to traceability. Are these financial\ninjuries \u201cfairly traceable to the challenged conduct\u201d?Hollingsworth, 570 U.\u00a0S., at 704. The answer is clearly\nyes. The reporting requirements in \u00a7\u00a76055 and 6056 are enforceable\nby the Federal Government, and noncompliance may result in heavy\npenalties. Section 6721(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code, for\nexample, provides \u201ca penalty\u201d for the failure to complete an\n\u201cinformation return,\u201d which includes reports required by \u00a7\u00a76055(a)\nand 6056(a). See 26 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a76724(d)(1)(B)(xxiv),\n(xxv). And \u00a76722(a)(1) provides \u201ca penalty\u201d for the failure to\nissue a \u201cpayee statement,\u201d which includes the reports required by\n\u00a7\u00a76055(c) and 6056(c). See \u00a7\u00a76724(d)(2)(GG), (HH). These penalties\ncan amount to at least $280 per infraction, and they can quickly\nrun up into the millions of dollars. See \u00a7\u00a76721, 6722.[6]That leaves redressability, which asks whether\nthe requested relief is likely to redress the party\u2019s injury.Steel Co.v.Citizens for Better Environment,523 U.S.\n83, 103 (1998). Looking to the relief the District Court in\nfact granted makes it obvious that the States\u2019 injuries in the form\nof ongoing reporting expenses are redressable. The District Court\nentered a judgment that, among other things, declared the reporting\nrequirements in \u00a7\u00a76055 and 6056 unenforceable. See 340\nF.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at 619. With that judgment in hand, the States\nwould be freed from the obligation to expend funds to comply with\nthose requirements\u2014redressing their financial injury\nprospectively.The state plaintiffs have similarly demonstrated\nstanding to seek relief from ACA provisions requiring them to offer\nexpensive health insurance coverage for their employees. Consider\nthe ACA\u2019s requirement that group health plans and health insurance\nofferings extend coverage to adult children until they reach the\nage of 26. See 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7300gg\u201314(a). Texas has spent\nmore than $80 million complying with that rule. App. 81. Missouri\nhas spent more than $10 million.Id., at 159;id., at\n157 (\u201cThe Missouri Consolidated Health Care Plan is a non-federal\ngovernmental health plan which provides insurance coverage for most\nstate employees\u201d);id., at 159 (Missouri will \u201cindefinitely\ncontinue paying these additional costs\u201d).These obligations, too, are backed by\nsubstantial enforcement mechanisms. For instance, the state\nplaintiffs generally must offer employees coverage that complies\nwith \u00a7300gg\u201314 to avoid violating the employer mandate, see 26\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a74980H, and the failure to comply would expose\nthe States to penalties of thousands of dollars per employee each\nyear, see \u00a7\u00a74980H(a), (b), (c)(1). Similarly, the failure to cover\nadult children would expose many state health plans to penalties\nunder 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7300gg\u201322(b)(2), and those penalties\ncan amount to $100 per day for each person offered noncompliant\ncoverage.Ibid.Thus, the States are presented with the\nchoice of spending millions to cover adult children or risking\nuntold sums for failing to do so.In this way, the States\u2019 financial injuries from\noffering health coverage to adult children are traceable to the\nlooming threat of enforcement actions. And those financial injuries\ncan be prospectively redressed by a declaratory judgment making\nclear that the States are not, in fact, obligated to offer health\ncoverage to children up to age 26.While I have outlined two examples of concrete,\ntraceable, and redressable injuries demonstrated by the state\nplaintiffs, these examples are not exhaustive. The ACA is an\nenormously complex statute, and the States have offered evidence of\nongoing financial injuries relating to compliance with many other\ndifferent (and enforceable) ACA provisions. See,e.g., App.\n81\u201386 (Texas\u2019s compliance costs);id., at 139 (Kansas);id., at 158\u2013162, 165\u2013170 (Missouri);id., at 182\u2013184\n(South Carolina);id., at 186\u2013190 (South Dakota);id., at 345\u2013350 (Georgia).BThe Court largely ignores the theory of\nstanding outlined above. It devotes most of its attention to two\nother theories, seeante, at 4\u201314, and when it does address\nthe relevant injuries, its arguments are deeply flawed.The Court\u2019s primary argument rests on a patent\ndistortion of the traceability prong of our established test for\nstanding. Partially quoting a line inAllen, the Court\ndemands a showing that the \u201cGovernment\u2019s conductin question\nis .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0\u2018fairly traceable\u2019 to enforcement ofthe\n\u2018allegedly unlawful\u2019 provision of which the plaintiffs\ncomplain\u2014\u00a75000A(a).\u201dAnte, at 15 (quoting 468\nU.\u00a0S., at 751; emphasis added). This is a flat-out\nmisstatement of the law and what the Court wrote inAllen.\nWhatAllenactually requires is a \u201cpersonal injury fairly\ntraceable tothe defendant\u2019s allegedly unlawful conduct,\u201did., at 751 (emphasis added). And what this statement means\nis that the plaintiff\u00a0\u2019s \u201cinjury\u201d must be traceable to the\ndefendant\u2019s conduct, and that conduct must be \u201callegedly\nunlawful.\u201d[7] \u201cAllegedly\nunlawful\u201d means that the plaintiff must allege that the conduct is\nunlawful. (The States allege that the challenged enforcement\nactions are unlawful using a traditional legal argument, seeinfra, at 15\u201320.) But a plaintiff\u00a0\u2019s standing (and thus\nthe court\u2019s Article III jurisdiction) does not require a\ndemonstration that the defendant\u2019s conduct is in fact unlawful.\nThat is a merits issue.If Article III standing required a showing that\nthe plaintiff\u00a0\u2019s alleged injury is traceable to (i.e.,\nin some way caused by) an unconstitutional provision, then whenever\na claim of unconstitutionality was ultimately held to lack legal\nmerit\u2014even after a full trial\u2014the consequence would be that the\ncourt lacked jurisdiction to entertain the suit in the first place.\nThat would be absurd, and this Court has long resisted efforts to\ntransform ordinary merits questions into threshold jurisdictional\nquestions by jamming them into the standing inquiry. See,e.g.,\nArizona State Legislaturev.Arizona Independent\nRedistricting Comm\u2019n, 576 U.S. 787, 800 (2015);Whitmorev.Arkansas,495 U.S.\n149, 155 (1990);ASARCO Inc.v.Kadish,490 U.S.\n605, 624 (1989). \u201c[S]tanding does not depend on the merits of a\nclaim.\u201dDavisv.United States,564 U.S.\n229, 249, n. 10 (2011) (internal quotation marks and\nalterations omitted). And \u201c\u00a0\u2018jurisdiction is not defeated by\nthe possibility that the averments [in a complaint] might fail to\nstate a cause of action on which petitioners could actually\nrecover.\u2019\u00a0\u201dSteel Co., 523 U.\u00a0S., at 89 (quotingBellv.Hood,327 U.S.\n678, 682 (1946); alterations omitted). Rather, if the\nchallenged action is \u201callegedly unlawful,\u201d that suffices for\nstanding purposes.Allen, 468 U.\u00a0S., at 751; see alsoWhitmore, 495 U.\u00a0S., at 155 (\u201cOur threshold inquiry\ninto standing in no way depends on the merits of the petitioner\u2019s\ncontention that particular conduct is illegal\u201d (internal quotation\nmarks and alterations omitted)).CThe Court\u2019s distortion of the traceability\nrequirement is bad enough in itself, but there is more. After\nimposing an obstacle that the States should not have to surmount to\nestablish standing, the Court turns around and refuses to consider\nwhether the States have cleared that obstacle. It\u2019s as if the Court\ntold the States: \u201cIn order to bring your case in federal court, you\nhave to pay a filing fee of $100,000, but we will not give you a\nchance to pay that money.\u201dThe Court says that the States cannot establish\nstanding unless they show that their injuries are traceable to the\nindividual mandate, and the States claim that their injuries are\nindeed traceable to the mandate. Their argument proceeds in two\nsteps. First, they contend that the individual mandate is\nunconstitutional because it does not fall within any power granted\nto Congress by the Constitution. Second, they argue that costly\nobligations imposed on them by other provisions of the ACA cannot\nbe severed from the mandate. If both steps of the States\u2019 argument\nthat the challenged enforcement actions are unlawful are correct,\nit follows that the Government cannot lawfully enforce those\nobligations against the States.There can be no question that this argument is\nconceptually sound. Imagine Statute ABC. Provision A imposes\nenforceable legal obligations on the plaintiff. Provision B imposes\na legal obligation on a different party. And provision C provides\nthat a party is not obligated to comply with provision A if\nprovision B is held to be unconstitutional. Based on the plain text\nof this law, a party subject to provision A should be able to\nobtain relief from the enforcement of provision A if it can show\nthat provision B is unconstitutional. To hold otherwise would be\ndirectly contrary to the statutory text. But the Court\u2019s reasoning\nwould make such a claim impossible. The plaintiff would be thrown\nout of court at the outset of the case for lack of standing.That cannot be right. And if the Court really\nmeans to foreclose all such claims from now on, that is a big\nchange because we have repeatedly heard such arguments and\nevaluated them on the merits. See Lea, Situational Severability,\n103 Va. L.\u00a0Rev. 735, 769 (2017) (explaining that similar\n\u201cclaims are a longstanding feature of American jurisprudence\u201d).InSeila Law LLCv.Consumer Financial\nProtection Bureau, 591 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2020), a law firm\nresisted the CFPB\u2019s efforts to enforce a civil investigative\ndemand. The firm argued that (A) it was harmed by actions taken\nunder statutory provisions authorizing the Bureau to issue civil\ninvestigative demands; (B) the Bureau\u2019s Director, under whose\nauthority the demands had been issued, was protected by an unlawful\nremoval restriction; and (C) the removal restriction was\ninseverable from the investigative provisions. The Court did not\ndecide the severability issue at the standing stage. Instead, it\nproperly treated severability as a merits issue, held that the\nremoval restriction was unlawful, and considered whether relief\ncould be granted because the investigative provisions were\ninseverable from the removal restriction.Id., at ___\u2013___\n(opinion of the Court) (slip op., at 11\u201330);id., at ___\u2013___\n(plurality opinion) (slip op., at 30\u201336).Indeed, theSeila LawCourt had little\ntrouble dismissing the same misguided approach to traceability that\nthe majority adopts today. The court-appointedamicussuggested that there was lack of traceability because there was no\nproof that the injury was caused by the removal restriction. \u201cOur\nprecedents say otherwise,\u201d we explained, as a \u201cplaintiff\u00a0\u2019s\ninjury must be fairly traceable to the challenged action of the\ndefendant,\u201d and it is \u201csufficient that the challenger sustains\ninjury from an executive act that allegedly exceeds the official\u2019s\nauthority.\u201dId., at ___\u2013___ (opinion of the Court) (slip\nop., at 9\u201310) (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).\nNot a single Justice disputed that conclusion.InFree Enterprise Fundv.Public\nCompany Accounting Oversight Bd.,561 U.S.\n477(2010), an accounting firm challenged the power of the\nPublic Company Accounting Oversight Board to regulate the\naccounting industry and investigate its activities. The firm argued\nthat (A) it was harmed by the actions taken under statutory\nprovisions that gave the Board regulatory and investigatory\nauthority; (B) other provisions unlawfully insulated Board members\nwith dual-layer for-cause removal restrictions; and (C) the removal\nprovisions were inseverable from provisions authorizing the\npertinent regulatory activities. The Court entertained this\nargument on the merits, concluding that the removal restriction was\nunlawful,id., at 492\u2013508, but rejecting the argument that\nthe removal provision was inseverable from the provisions\nauthorizing the actions that directly harmed the firm,id.,\nat 508\u2013510. While the Court\u2019s severability determination meant that\nthe accounting firm was \u201cnot entitled to broad injunctive relief\nagainst the Board\u2019s continued operations,\u201did., at 513, no\none questioned the firm\u2019s standing to seek that relief in the first\nplace.InMinnesotav.Mille Lacs Band of\nChippewa Indians,526 U.S.\n172(1999), several Bands of Chippewa Indians sought a\ndeclaratory judgment that an 1837 Treaty gave their members a right\nto hunt on historic Chippewa lands. An 1850 Executive Order had\npurported to revoke those hunting rights, but the Bands argued that\n(A) one portion of the Executive Order purported to extinguish\ntheir hunting rights; (B) a different portion of the Executive\nOrder\u2014the \u201cremoval order,\u201d which had nothing to do with hunting\nrights\u2014was unlawful; and (C) the hunting rights revocation was\ninseverable from the removal order and thus ineffective. The Court\nentertained this argument on the merits and granted relief. It\nfirst assumed \u201cthat the severability standard for statutes also\napplies to Executive Orders.\u201dId., at 191. Then it\ndetermined that there was \u201cno statutory or constitutional\nauthority\u201d for the removal order and that the \u201cExecutive Order was\ninsufficient to [revoke hunting rights] because it was not\nseverable from the invalid removal order.\u201dId., at 193, 195.\nIn other words, the Bands obtained relief with the same type of\nargument the state plaintiffs press here.InNew Yorkv.United States,505 U.S.\n144, 186 (1992), the State of New York challenged three\nprovisions of the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Amendments Act\nof 1985, 99Stat. 1842, 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72021bet seq.\nSignificant for present purposes, the Court accepted New York\u2019s\nchallenge to one of those provisions, 505 U.\u00a0S., at 174\u2013177,\nand rejected its challenges to two others,id., at 171\u2013174,\n183\u2013186. But the Court did not stop there. Instead, it went on to\nconsider whether New York nonetheless could obtain relief from the\nother two provisions on the ground that those provisions were\ninseverable from the unlawful provision and thus unenforceable.Id., at 186\u2013187; seePrintzv.United States,521 U.S.\n898, 935 (1997) (explaining thatNew York\u201caddress[ed]\nseverability where remaining provisions at issue affected the\nplaintiffs\u201d). In other words, the Court considered whether New York\ncould obtain relief from the enforcement of independently\nconstitutional provisions where a statute contained (A) two\nindependently constitutional provisions; (B) an unconstitutional\nprovision; and (C) the constitutional provisions were arguably\ninseverable from the unconstitutional provision.InAlaska Airlines, Inc.v.Brock,480 U.S.\n678(1987), a group of airlines challenged provisions of the\nAirline Deregulation Act of 1978, 92Stat. 1705, that benefited\nairline employees. The airlines argued that (A) enforcement of and\nregulations under those provisions injured them; (B) the Airline\nDeregulation Act also contained an unlawful legislative veto; and\n(C) the employee-benefit provisions were \u201cineffective\u201d because they\nwere inseverable from the legislative veto provision, 480\nU.\u00a0S., at 680. This Court considered and unanimously rejected\nthe airlines\u2019 argument on the merits of the severability question,id., at 687\u2013697, but no one questioned the airlines\u2019\nstanding to seek relief.The Court\u2019s treatment of these arguments in the\ncases just discussed is not a modern innovation. InEl Paso\n& Northeastern R. Co.v.Gutierrez,215 U.S.\n87(1909), for example, a railway company challenged a portion\nof the Employers\u2019 Liability Act of 1906, 34Stat. 232, that\npreempted territorial law more favorable to the railway. The\ncompany argued that (A) a portion of the Act governing U.\u00a0S.\nTerritories exposed it to liability in the suit; (B) other portions\naffecting intrastate commerce exceeded Congress\u2019s Commerce Clause\npower; and (C) the first portion could not be applied because it\nwas inseverable from the unconstitutional portions. The Court\nagreed that the interstate commerce aspects of the Act were\nunlawful, but held that they were severable from the territorial\nprovision. 215 U.\u00a0S., at 93\u201398.InMarshall Field & Co.v.Clark,143 U.S.\n649(1892), three importers challenged the collection of\ntariffs under the McKinley Tariff Act. See Act of Oct. 1, 1890,\n26Stat. 567. They argued that (A) several provisions of the Act\nimposed tariffs on goods they imported; (B) \u00a73 of the Act\nunlawfully delegated legislative powers to the President by\npermitting him to suspend the free importation of other types of\ngoods; and (C) \u00a73 was inseverable from the provisions imposing\ntariffs on the goods they imported. The Court heard the argument on\nthe merits and, after extensive analysis, rejected the\nnon-delegation challenge to \u00a73.Id., at 680\u2013694. Because \u00a73\nwas lawful, the Court did not \u201center upon the consideration\u201d of\nwhether \u201cother parts of the act, those which directly imposed\nduties upon articles imported, would be inoperative\u201d if \u00a73 were\nunlawful.Id., at 694.Similarly, in theTrade-Mark Cases,100 U.S.\n82(1879), this Court reviewed a series of criminal\nprosecutions for alleged violations of an 1876 criminal law\nprohibiting the \u201cfraudulent use, sale, and counterfeiting of\ntrade-marks,\u201did., at 92. The Court held that (A) the\nprosecutions under the 1876 Act could not proceed because (B) an\n1870 Act creating the underlying trademark rights exceeded\nCongress\u2019s powers under the Commerce Clause,id., at 95\u201398,\nand (C) the 1876 Act underlying the prosecutions was inseverable\nfrom the 1870 Act and thus \u201cfalls with it,\u201did., at 99.There is nothing novel about the state\nplaintiffs\u2019 claims. What is new and revolutionary is the rule the\nCourt has concocted to sink those claims.DThe Court has no real response to the\narguments set out above, so it falls back on the claim that the\nStates forfeited those arguments because they (1) did not\n\u201cdirectly\u201d argue them in the courts below, (2) did not present them\nat the certiorari stage, and (3) did not raise them in this Court.\nSeeante, at 10. Justice Thomas makes a forfeiture argument\nexpressly. Seeante, at 4\u20136, and nn. 1\u20132 (concurring\nopinion).[8] There is nothing\nto any of these arguments.Consider the States\u2019 standing to seek relief\nfrom the IRS reporting obligations. The States identified these\ncosts in their complaint, see App. 58\u201360, Amended Complaint \u00b641(i);\noffered extensive evidence of these costs on summary judgment, seesupra, at 10\u201311; and argued that these provisions cannot be\nsevered from the individual mandate, see,e.g., App. 63,\nAmended Complaint \u00b657 (\u201cThe remainder of the ACA is non-severable\nfrom the individual mandate, meaning that the Act must be\ninvalidated as a whole\u201d). They expressly advanced that argument in\nthe Court of Appeals, see Brief for State Appellees inTexasv.UnitedStates, No. 19\u201310011 (CA5), pp. 23\u201324,\n36\u201350, and the Court of Appeals accepted it for standing purposes,\nsee 945 F. 3d, at 384\u2013387. In this Court, the States argued that\nthey have standing based on these reporting obligations in their\nbrief opposing the petition filed by California and the other\nparties that intervened to defend the ACA, see Brief in Opposition\n17, and in their merits brief, see Brief for\nRespondent/Cross-Petitioner States 20\u201322. They specifically\nidentified the consequences of noncompliance to which these\ninjuries are traceable,id., at 22 (\u201cEmployers can be\nsanctioned by the IRS for failing to submit adequate information.\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. In other words, state respondents are compelled\nunder threat of government sanction to produce [the] forms\u201d). And\nthey argued that these obligations are not enforceable because they\nare inseverable from the individual mandate,id., at 36\u201346;\nsee alsoid., at 26\u201327 (discussingAlaska Airlines,\n480 U.\u00a0S. 678).For these reasons, it is clear that the States\ndid not forfeit the arguments discussed in this dissent.[9]*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*I would hold that the States have demonstrated\nstanding to seek relief from the ACA provisions that burden them\nand that they claim are inseparable from the individual\nmandate.IIIBecause the state plaintiffs have standing, I\nproceed to consider the merits of this lawsuit. That requires\nassessing whether the individual mandate is unlawful and whether it\nis inseverable from the provisions that burden the States.I begin with the question whether the individual\nmandate falls within a power granted to Congress under Article I of\nthe Constitution. The Constitution\u2019s text and our precedent compel\nthe conclusion that it does not.The Federal Government \u201cis acknowledged by all\nto be one of enumerated powers.\u201dMcCullochv.Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 405 (1819) (Marshall, C.\u00a0J.,\nfor the Court). Article I of the Constitution does not give\nCongress \u201cplenary legislative power.\u201dMurphyv.National\nCollegiate Athletic Assn., 584 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2018) (slip\nop., at 15). Instead, it enumerates certain legislative powers\nthat, while \u201csizeable,\u201d are not \u201cunlimited.\u201dIbid.When the constitutionality of the individual\nmandate was first challenged inNFIB, the Government\u2019s\nprimary defense was that it represented a valid exercise of\nCongress\u2019s power to regulate interstate commerce, but a majority of\nthe Court squarely rejected that argument. See 567 U.\u00a0S., at\n572 (opinion of the Court) (\u201cThe Court today holds that our\nConstitution protects us from federal regulation under the Commerce\nClause so long as we abstain from the regulated activity\u201d); see\nalsoid., at 561 (opinion of Roberts, C.\u00a0J.) (\u201cThe\ncommerce power thus does not authorize the mandate\u201d);id.,\nat 648 (joint dissent) (\u201cThe Act before us here exceeds federal\npower .\u00a0.\u00a0. in mandating the purchase of health\ninsurance\u201d). Likewise, a majority of the Court rejected the\nGovernment\u2019s resort to the Necessary and Proper Clause. Seeid., at 560 (opinion of Roberts, C.\u00a0J.);id., at\n655 (joint dissent). I agreed with those holdings at the time, and\nthat is still my view. The mandate cannot be sustained under the\nCommerce Clause or the Necessary and Proper Clause, and in this\nsuit, no party urges us to uphold it on those grounds.While theNFIBCourt rejected the\nGovernment\u2019s Commerce Clause argument, a majority held that the\nmandate represented a lawful exercise of Congress\u2019s taxing power,\nseeid., at 575 (opinion of Roberts, C.\u00a0J.); see alsoid., at 574 (opinion of the Court), and the House and state\nintervenors now argue that the mandate can still be sustained on\nthis ground despite the fact that the \u201ctax\u201d it supposedly imposes\nis now set at zero. InNFIB, I did not see how the mandate\u2019s\npenalty could be understood as a tax, seeid., at 661\u2013669\n(joint dissent), but assuming for the sake of argument that the\nmajority\u2019s understanding was correct at the time, it is now\nindefensible.The Constitution grants Congress the power to\n\u201clay and collect Taxes\u201d \u201cto pay the Debts and provide for the\ncommon Defence and general Welfare of the United States.\u201d Art. I,\n\u00a78, cl.\u00a01. InNFIB, the Court made clear that \u201cthe\nessential feature of any tax\u201d is that it \u201cproduces at least some\nrevenue for the Government.\u201d 567 U.\u00a0S., at 564 (opinion of the\nCourt). That limitation follows from the text of the provision. A\ntax cannot assist in paying debts or providing for the general\nwelfare or defense if it raises no money. Moreover, the concept of\nlaying and collecting taxes plainly entails the collection of\nrevenue. At the founding, to \u201clay\u201d in the relevant sense meant to\n\u201cassess; to charge; to impose.\u201d 2 N. Webster, An American\nDictionary of the English Language (1828) (Webster); see also S.\nJohnson, A Dictionary of the English Language (10th ed. 1792)\n(Johnson) (\u201cTo charge as a payment\u201d). To \u201ccollect\u201d meant to \u201cgather\nmoney or revenue from debtors; to demand and receive.\u201d 1 Webster;\nsee also Johnson (\u201cTo gather together\u201d). And a \u201ctax\u201d was a \u201crate or\nsum of money\u201d assessed on certain persons or property. 2 Webster.\nRead together, this language means that Congress is empowered to\npass laws that raise revenue.In recognizing that raising revenue is an\n\u201cessential feature\u201d of any exercise of the taxing power,NFIBbuilt on a substantial line of precedent. SeeDepartment of Revenue of Mont.v.Kurth Ranch,511 U.S.\n767, 778 (1994);United Statesv.Kahriger,345 U.S.\n22, 28, and n.\u00a04 (1953);United Statesv.Sanchez,340 U.S.\n42, 44 (1950);Sonzinskyv.United States,300 U.S.\n506, 513\u2013514 (1937);A. Magnano Co.v.Hamilton,292 U.S.\n40, 46 (1934). Indeed, the state intervenors and the House have\nnot identified any statute ever passed under the taxing power that\ndid not raise revenue.Virginia Office for Protection and\nAdvocacyv.Stewart,563 U.S.\n247, 260 (2011) (\u201cLack of historical precedent can indicate a\nconstitutional infirmity .\u00a0.\u00a0. \u201d); seeSeila Law,\n591 U.\u00a0S., at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 18\u201321);Free Enterprise\nFund, 561 U.\u00a0S., at 505. Given this text, history, and\nprecedent, it is no longer defensible to argue that the individual\nmandate can be construed as a lawful exercise of Congress\u2019s taxing\npower, for as it now stands, the mandate will never \u201cproduc[e] at\nleast some revenue for the Government.\u201dNFIB, 567\nU.\u00a0S., at 564 (opinion of the Court). The penalty for\nnoncompliance is set at 0% and $0. It cannot raise a cent.The state intervenors and the House offer\nseveral other arguments to sustain the mandate, but each fails.\nFirst, they suggest that we should interpret the individual mandate\nas an exercise of the taxing power based solely on the precedential\neffect of the Court\u2019s decision inNFIB. But The Chief\nJustice\u2019s opinion for the Court inNFIBconstrued the\nmandate as a tax only because the individual mandate \u201cproduce[d] at\nleast some revenue for the Government.\u201dIbid. With that\n\u201cessential feature\u201d removed, this construction is foreclosed.Second, the state intervenors and the House\nargue that the Taxing Clause permits Congress to pass a tax and\nsubsequently reduce it to zero. But Congress cannot supplement its\npowers through the two-step process of passing a tax and then\nremoving the tax but leaving in place a provision that is otherwise\nbeyond its enumerated powers.Third, they analogize the mandate to a delayed\nor suspended tax\u2014one that raises no revenue now but could do so in\nthe future. But \u00a75000A, as it currently stands, does not delay or\nsuspend the collection of revenue. Unless Congress amends that\nprovision and provides for it to begin raising revenue at some\nfuture date, the \u201ctax\u201d is permanently set at zero.The state intervenors offer one final defense of\nthe individual mandate: Even if it cannot be sustained under the\nCommerce Clause, Taxing Clause, or Necessary and Proper Clause,\nthey argue that we should interpret the mandate as a mere precatory\nstatement. In their view, Congress is free to urge Americans to\ntake actions that it could not constitutionally require, and that\nis all it has done here.This argument fails because the individual\nmandate is not a precatory statement. The text of the provision is\nclear. It states that every covered individual \u201cshall\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. ensure that the individual, and any dependent of\nthe individual .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0, is covered under minimum\nessential coverage .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d 26 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a75000A(a). \u201cShall\u201d typically means must, not should. SeeKingdomware Technologies,Inc.v.United\nStates, 579 U.S. 162, 171\u2013172 (2016). And the text confirms\nthat \u201cshall\u201d means \u201cmust\u201d by terming the individual mandate a\n\u201c[r]equirement to maintain minimum essential coverage.\u201d \u00a75000A(a);\nsee alsoNFIB, 567 U.\u00a0S., at 663 (joint dissent)\n(providing other statutory references to the individual mandate as\na requirement).Mere precatory provisions, by contrast,\ntypically use the word \u201cshould\u201d to signify that they are not\nmandatory,e.g., 4 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a78(c) (\u201cThe flag\nshould never be carried flat or horizontally, but always aloft and\nfree\u201d), or make clear that they convey only the \u201csense of\nCongress,\u201de.g., 15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a77807 (\u201cIt is the\nsense of Congress that States should enact the Uniform Athlete\nAgents Act of 2000\u201d). Congress adopted those very formulations\nelsewhere in the ACA, see,e.g., 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7292s(d) (\u201cIt is the sense of Congress that funds repaid under the\nloan program .\u00a0.\u00a0. should not be transferred to the\nTreasury\u201d), but chose markedly different language when crafting the\nindividual mandate. Because the individual mandate is, in fact, a\nmandate, it cannot be considered a mere suggestion to purchase\ninsurance.For these reasons, I conclude that the\nindividual mandate exceeds the scope of Congress\u2019s enumerated\nlegislative powers.IVThis brings me to the next question: whether\nthe state plaintiffs have shown that the provisions of the ACA\nimposing burdens on them are inseparable from the unconstitutional\nindividual mandate. I conclude that those provisions are\ninextricably linked to the individual mandate and that the States\nhave therefore demonstrated on the merits that those other\nprovisions cannot be enforced against them. Accordingly, the States\nare entitled to a judgment providing that they are not obligated to\ncomply with the ACA provisions that burden them.All the opinions inNFIBacknowledged the\ncentral role of the individual mandate\u2019s tax or penalty. In brief,\nthe ACA aimed to achieve \u201cnear-universal\u201d health-care coverage. 42\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a718091(2)(D). A major obstacle was the inability\nof many individuals to obtain adequate insurance due to the\nexpensive medical care they were likely to require. To address that\nproblem, the ACA included \u201cguaranteed issue\u201d and \u201ccommunity rating\u201d\nprovisions. These key provisions prohibit insurance companies from\ndenying coverage or charging higher premiums to the individuals\ndescribed above. And to compensate for the financial impact of\nthese provisions on insurers, the individual mandate required the\npurchase of insurance by persons whose predicted medical expenses\nwere substantially lower than the premiums they would pay. SeeNFIB, 567 U.\u00a0S., at 547\u2013548 (opinion of Roberts,\nC.\u00a0J.);id., at 595\u2013599 (opinion of Ginsburg, J.);id., at 648\u2013651, 691\u2013696 (joint dissent); see alsoKing, 576 U.\u00a0S., at 482 (\u201cCongress found that the\nguaranteed issue and community rating requirements would not work\nwithout the\u201d individual mandate).Thus, the guaranteed-issue and community-rating\nprovisions were crucial to the success of the ACA scheme, and a tax\nor penalty for noncompliance with the individual mandate was\nessential to the ACA\u2019s distribution of risks and burdens. The ACA\ncontains an express finding on exactly that point:\u201cThe requirement [i.e., the\nindividual mandate] isessentialto creating effective\nhealth insurance markets in which improved health insurance\nproducts that are guaranteed issue and do not exclude coverage of\npre-existing conditions can be sold.\u201d 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a718091(2)(I) (emphasis added).See alsoNFIB, 567 U.\u00a0S., at 694\u2013696\n(joint dissent) (describing other statutory provisions declaring\nthat the individual mandate works \u201ctogether\u201d with the rest of the\nACA).InNFIB, the Government agreed that the\nindividual mandate was inextricably related to those crucial\nprovisions. Seeid., at 650 (citing Brief for Petitioners,\nO. T. 2011, No. 11\u2013398, p.\u00a024). And so did Justice Ginsburg\u2019s\nopinion. See 567 U.\u00a0S., at 597 (\u201c[T]hese two provisions\n[i.e., the guaranteed-issue and community-rating\nprovisions], Congress comprehended, could not work effectively\nunless individuals were given a powerful incentive to obtain\ninsurance\u201d); see alsoibid. (quoting congressional testimony\nthat the insurance market would be \u201c\u00a0\u2018drive[n] .\u00a0.\u00a0.\ninto extinction\u2019\u00a0\u201d without \u201c\u00a0\u2018amandate on\nindividual[s] to be insured\u2019\u00a0\u201d).Recognizing this relationship, the joint\ndissent, after finding that the individual mandate and Medicaid\nexpansion provision were unconstitutional, concluded that other\nprovisions of the ACA could not be enforced. We analyzed this\nquestion under what we described as the Court\u2019s \u201c\u00a0\u2018well\nestablished\u2019\u00a0\u201d two-part test.Id., at 692 (joint\ndissent) (quotingAlaska Airlines, 480 U.\u00a0S., at\n684).Under this test, the first question was whether\nthe remainder of the ACA would \u201coperate in the manner Congress\nintended\u201d without the unconstitutional provisions.NFIB, 567\nU.\u00a0S., at 692. And to satisfy this requirement, we explained,\nit was not enough that the remaining provisions could operate by\nthemselves \u201cin some coherent way.\u201dIbid. The question,\ninstead, was whether those provisions would operate as Congress\nwrote them.Ibid. If this requirement was met, the second\npart of the test asked whether \u201cCongress would have enacted [the\nother provisions] standing alone and without the unconstitutional\nportion.\u201dId., at 693; seeid.,at 692\u2013694.Applying this test, we concluded that, without\nthe unconstitutional provisions, neither the other ACA provisions\nwe labeled \u201cmajor\u201d nor many of those we described as \u201cminor\u201d could\noperate as Congress intended.Id., at 697\u2013705. And we opined\nthat Congress would not have enacted the remaining minor provisions\nby themselves.Id., at 704\u2013705. We noted that they had been\nadopted as part of a complex package deal and that \u201c[t]here [was]\nno reason to believe that Congress would have enacted them\nindependently.\u201dId., at 705.Nothing that has happened since that decision\ncalls for a different conclusion now. It is certainly true that the\nrepeal of the tax or penalty has not caused the collapse of the\nentire ACA apparatus, but the critical question under the framework\napplied in theNFIBdissent is not whether the ACA could\noperate insomeway without the individual mandate but\nwhether it could operate in anything like the manner Congress\ndesigned. The answer to that question is clear. When the tax or\npenalty was collected, costs were shifted from individuals\npreviously denied coverage due to their medical conditions and\nplaced on others who purchased insurance only because the failure\nto do so was taxed or penalized. The repeal of the tax or penalty\nhas not made the costs of the guaranteed-issue and community-\nrating requirements disappear. Those costs have obviously been\nshifted to others\u2014in all likelihood to individuals who now pay\nhigher premiums or face higher deductibles or to the taxpayers.\nThis shift fundamentally changed the operation of the scheme\nCongress adopted.The repeal of the tax or penalty also provides\nno reason to doubt our previous conclusion about Congress\u2019s intent.\nWhile the 2017 Act repealed the tax or penalty, it did not alter\nthe statutory finding noted above, and the 2017 Act cannot\nplausibly be viewed as the manifestation of a congressional intent\nto preserve the ACA in altered form. The 2017 Act would not have\npassed the House without the votes of the Members who had voted to\nscrap the ACA just a few months earlier,[10] and the repeal of the tax or penalty, which they\nobviously found particularly offensive, was their fallback option.\nThey eliminated the tax or penalty and left the chips to fall as\nthey might. Thus, under the reasoning of theNFIBdissent,\nthe provisions burdening the States are inseverable from the\nindividual mandate.The same result follows under the new approach\nto questions of partial unconstitutionality that some Members of\nthe Court have adopted in the years sinceNFIB. They have\nsuggested the severability analysis should track ordinary rules of\nstatutory interpretation.Seila Law, 591 U.\u00a0S., at ___,\n___\u2013___ (Thomas, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part)\n(slip op., at 16, 20\u201321). In their view, Congress decides whether\nthe provisions it enacts are linked to one another or not, and the\nanswer lies in the ordinary tools of statutory construction. And\neverything theNFIBdissenters said points to the same\nconclusion as a matter of the ACA\u2019s text, history, and structure.\nThe relevant provisions were passed as a comprehensive exercise of\nCongress\u2019s Commerce Clause and (arguably) Taxing Clause powers.\nThose powers cannot justify the individual mandate. The statutory\ntext says the individual mandate is \u201cessential\u201d to the overall\nscheme, 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a718091(2)(I), and it repeatedly\nstates that the various provisions work \u201ctogether,\u201dNFIB,\n567 U.\u00a0S., at 694\u2013696 (joint dissent). It does not matter that\nthis language appears in a section entitled \u201cfindings\u201d as opposed\nto a section entitled \u201cseverability.\u201d Congress can link distinct\nprovisions in any number of ways, on this view, so long as it does\nso in the text. The broader statutory history and structure,\nmoreover, reinforce that conclusion. TheNFIBdissent\nexplained how the ACA\u2019s provisions work in tandem to alter the\ninsurance market. 567 U.\u00a0S., at 691\u2013706. Here, the individual\nmandate requires individuals to obtain \u201cminimum essential\ncoverage.\u201d 26 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a75000A(f\u00a0). The reporting\nrequirements, in turn, implement the mandate\u2014indeed, they\nexplicitly cross- reference \u00a75000A\u2014by requiring employers to\nprovide information about such coverage. \u00a7\u00a76055(e), 6056(b)(2)(B).\nAnd the adult-children coverage requirement works as part of a\ncohesive set of insurance reforms central to the ACA\u2019s overall\nstructure, which turns on healthy persons\u2019 entry into the market\nvia the individual mandate. See 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7300gg\u201314(a).\nThe individual mandate is thus inseverable from the provisions\nburdening the States under either approach to severability.Having determined that the individual mandate is\n(1) unlawful and (2) inseverable from the provisions burdening the\nstate plaintiffs, the final question is what to do about it. The\nanswer largely flows from everything I have already said above.\nRelief in a case runs against parties, not against statutes.Supra, at 9\u201310. And provisions that are inseverable from\nunconstitutional features of a statute cannot be enforced.Supra, at 15\u201320. No matter how one approaches the question,\nthen, the answer is clear: Because the mandate is unlawful and\nbecause the injury-causing provisions are inextricably linked to\nthe mandate, the federal defendants cannot enforce those provisions\nagainst the state plaintiffs. And the state plaintiffs are entitled\nto a judgment providing as much. That answer comports with the\nreasoning of theNFIBjoint dissent, which made clear that\nthe state plaintiffs should not be required to comply with the\nprovisions of the ACA that burden them. See 567 U.\u00a0S., at\n697\u2013707. And it comports with the remedial approach others have\nadvocated in recent years. SeeMurphy, 584 U.\u00a0S., at\n___ (Thomas, J., concurring) (slip op., at 3);Seila Law,\n591 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (opinion of Thomas, J.) (slip op., at 24);Barrv.American Assn. of Political Consultants,Inc., 591 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2020) (Gorsuch, J.,\nconcurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part) (slip op.,\nat 5). Thus, under either the framework used in theNFIBjoint dissent or the alternative framework advocated in subsequent\ncases, the state plaintiffs are entitled to relief freeing them\nfrom compliance with the ACA provisions that burden them.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*No one can fail to be impressed by the lengths\nto which this Court has been willing to go to defend the ACA\nagainst all threats. A penalty is a tax. The United States is a\nState. And 18 States who bear costly burdens under the ACA cannot\neven get a foot in the door to raise a constitutional challenge. So\na tax that does not tax is allowed to stand and support one of the\nbiggest Government programs in our Nation\u2019s history. Fans of\njudicial inventiveness will applaud once again.But I must respectfully dissent.Notes1See Dept. of Commerce,\nBureau of Census, 2020 Annual Survey of Public Employment &\nPayroll Datasets, State Government Employment & Payroll Data\n(May 2021),\nwww.census.gov/data/datasets/2020/econ/apes/annual-apes.html.2SeePennsylvaniav.President of United States, 930 F.3d 543, 561\u2013565 (CA3\n2019).

But the\nmajority\u2019s rejection of the relevant theory of standing depends on\nthis erroneous description of the law.8In addition to claiming\nthat the States forfeited the standing theory set out in this\ndissent, Justice Thomas\u2019s concurrence lists several additional\nreasons why we should not address that theory. None is persuasive.\nThe concurrence invokes the rule that merits decisions that do not\ndiscuss jurisdiction are not of precedential value on\njurisdictional issues.Ante, at 5. This argument is\napparently a response to the many cases (141 years\u2019 worth) in which\nthis Court reached the merits of claims structured like those of\nthe state plaintiffs in the suit at hand. Seesupra, at\n16\u201320. The suggestion, I take it, is that the plaintiffs in those\ncases may have lacked standing and that therefore this Court erred\nin reaching the merits. To put the point lightly, that seems\nunlikely, and even if our prior decisions have not expressly\nembraced a standing theory like the States\u2019, there is no reason why\na conceptually sound theory should be rejected just because we\nnever previously saw fit to register express approval. Justice\nThomas states that \u201cthis Court has been inconsistent in describing\nwhether inseverability is a remedy or merits question.\u201dAnte, at 5. But all that matters for present purposes is\nthat inseverability is not a standing question. And in all events,\nthe concurrence elsewhere recognizes that severability is a merits\nquestion. Seeante, at 6 (\u201c[S]tanding-through-inseverability\ncould only be a valid theory of standing to the extent it treats\ninseverability as a merits exercise of statutory interpretation\u201d);ante,at 5, n. 2 (treating severability as a merits question\nunder the framework set forth inSteel Co., 523 U. S., at\n89). Finally, Justice Thomas suggests that a lack of argument on\nseverability \u201cposes a significant obstacle to review,\u201dante,\nat 5, n.\u00a02, but that flatly ignores that each party\u2014not to\nmention manyamici\u2014extensively briefed the severability\nquestion in this Court.9If the effect of the\nCourt\u2019s decision is dismissal of this action for lack of Article\nIII jurisdiction, the States may file a new action. See 18A C.\nWright & A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a74436 (3d\ned. 2020) (\u201cThe basic rule that dismissal for lack of\nsubject-matter jurisdiction does not preclude a second action\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. is well settled\u201d);Hughesv.United\nStates, 4 Wall. 232, 237 (1866) (\u201cIf the first suit was\ndismissed for .\u00a0.\u00a0. want of jurisdiction .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nthe judgment rendered will prove no bar to another suit\u201d);Lopezv.Pompeo, 923 F.3d 444, 447 (CA5 2019). And in\nany event, many other parties will have standing to bring such a\nclaim based on a variety of the ACA\u2019s substantive provisions that\nare arguably inseverable from the mandate. Our Affordable Care Act\nepic may go on.10Compare 163 Cong. Rec.
