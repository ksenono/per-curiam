MEREDITH, custodial parent and next\nfriend ofJOSHUA RYAN McDONALD, PETITIONER05\u2013915v.JEFFERSON COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION\net\u00a0al.on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the sixth circuit[June 28, 2007]Justice Thomas,\nconcurring.Today, the Court holds that state\nentities may not experiment with race-based means to achieve ends\nthey deem socially desirable. I wholly concur in The Chief\nJustice\u2019s opinion. I write separately to address several of the\ncontentions in Justice Breyer\u2019s dissent (hereinafter the dissent).\nContrary to the dissent\u2019s arguments, resegregation is not occurring\nin Seattle or Louisville; these school boards have no present\ninterest in remedying past segregation; and these race-based\nstudent-assignment programs do not serve any compelling state\ninterest. Accordingly, the plans are unconstitutional. Disfavoring\na color-blind interpretation of the Constitution, the dissent would\ngive school boards a free hand to make decisions on the basis of\nrace\u2014an approach reminiscent of that advocated by the\nsegregationists inBrownv.Board of Education,347 U. S.483 (1954). This approach is just as wrong today as it was\na half-century ago. The Constitution and our cases require us to be\nmuch more demanding before permitting local school boards to make\ndecisions based on race.IThe dissent repeatedly claims\nthat the school districts are threatened with resegregation and\nthat they will succumb to that threat if these plans are declared\nunconstitutional. It also argues that these plans can be justified\nas part of the school boards\u2019 attempts to \u201ceradicat[e] earlier\nschool segregation.\u201d See,e.g.,post, at 4.\nContrary to the dissent\u2019s rhetoric, neither of these school\ndistricts is threatened with resegregation, and neither is\nconstitutionally compelled or permitted to undertake race-based\nremediation. Racial imbalance is not segregation, and the mere\nincantation of terms like resegregation and remediation cannot make\nup the difference.ABecause this Court has authorized\nand required race-based remedial measures to addressde\njuresegregation, it is important to define segregation\nclearly and to distinguish it from racial imbalance. In the context\nof public schooling, segregation is the deliberate operation of a\nschool system to \u201ccarry out a governmental policy to separate\npupils in schools solely on the basis of race.\u201dSwannv.Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Ed.,402 U. S. 1, 6 (1971); see\nalsoMonroev.Board of Comm\u2019rs of Jackson,391 U. S. 450,\n452 (1968). InBrown,this Court declared that segregation\nwas unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment.Swann,supra, at 6; see\nalsoGreenv.School Bd. of New Kent Cty.,391 U. S. 430,\n435 (1968) (\u201c[T]he State, acting through the local school board and\nschool officials, organized and operated a dual system, part\n\u2018white\u2019 and part \u2018Negro.\u2019 It was such dual systems that 14 years\nagoBrown I[,347 U. S. 483,] held unconstitutional\nand a year laterBrown II[,349 U. S. 294(1955)]\nheld must be abolished\u201d).[Footnote 1]Racial imbalance is the\nfailure of a school district\u2019s individual schools to match or\napproximate the demographic makeup of the student population at\nlarge. Cf. Washingtonv.Seattle School Dist. No. 1,458 U. S. 457,\n460 (1982). Racial imbalance is not segregation.[Footnote 2] Although presently observed racial\nimbalance might result from pastde juresegregation,\nracial imbalance can also result from any number of innocent\nprivate decisions, including voluntary housing choices. SeeSwann,supra, at 25\u201326;Missouriv.Jenkins,515 U. S. 70, 116 (1995) (Thomas, J.,\nconcurring). Because racial imbalance is not inevitably linked to\nunconstitutional segregation, it is not unconstitutional in and of\nitself.Dayton Bd. of Ed.v.Brinkman,433 U. S. 406, 413\n(1977);Dayton Bd. of Ed.v.Brinkman,443 U. S. 526, 531,\nn.\u00a05 (1979) (\u201cRacial imbalance \u2026 is notper sea\nconstitutional violation\u201d);Freemanv.Pitts,503 U. S. 467,\n494 (1992); see alsoSwann,supra, at 31\u201332; cf.Millikenv.Bradley,418 U. S. 717, 740\u2013741,\nand n.\u00a019 (1974).Although there is arguably a danger of racial\nimbalance in schools in Seattle and Louisville, there is no danger\nof resegregation. No one contends that Seattle has established or\nthat Louisville has reestablished a dual school system that\nseparates students on the basis of race. The statistics cited in\nAppendix A to the dissent are not to the contrary. Seepost, at 69\u201372. At most, those statistics show a national\ntrend toward classroom racial imbalance. However, racial imbalance\nwithout intentional state action to separate the races does not\namount to segregation. To raise the specter of resegregation to\ndefend these programs is to ignore the meaning of the word and the\nnature of the cases before us.[Footnote 3]BJust as the school districts lack\nan interest in preventing resegregation, they also have no present\ninterest in remedying past segregation. The Constitution generally\nprohibits government race-based decisionmaking, but this Court has\nauthorized the use of race-based measures for remedial purposes in\ntwo narrowly defined circumstances. First, in schools that were\nformerly segregated by law, race-based measures are sometimes\nconstitutionally compelled to remedy prior school segregation.\nSecond, inCroson, the Court appeared willing to authorize\na government unit to remedy past discrimination for which it was\nresponsible.Richmondv.J. A. Croson Co.,488 U. S. 469,\n504 (1989). Without explicitly resting on either of these strands\nof doctrine, the dissent repeatedly invokes the school districts\u2019\nsupposed interests in remedying past segregation. Properly\nanalyzed, though, these plans do not fall within either existing\ncategory of permissible race-based remediation.1The Constitution does not permit\nrace-based government decisionmaking simply because a school\ndistrict claims a remedial purpose and proceeds in good faith with\narguably pure motives.Grutterv.Bollinger,539 U. S. 306, 371 (2003) (Thomas, J.,\nconcurring in part and dissenting in part) (citingAdarand\nConstructors, Inc.v.Pe&nacute;a,515 U. S. 200, 239 (1995) (Scalia, J.,\nconcurring in part and concurring in judgment)). Rather, race-based\ngovernment decisionmaking is categorically prohibited unless\nnarrowly tailored to serve a compelling interest.Grutter,supra, at 326; see also Part II\u2013A,infra. This\nexacting scrutiny \u201chas proven automatically fatal\u201d in most cases.Jenkins,supra, at 121 (Thomas, J., concurring);\ncf.Hirabayashiv.United States,320 U. S. 81, 100 (1943)\n(\u201c[R]acial discriminations are in most circumstances irrelevant and\ntherefore prohibited\u201d). And appropriately so. \u201cThe Constitution\nabhors classifications based on race, not only because those\nclassifications can harm favored races or are based on illegitimate\nmotives, but also because every time the government places citizens\non racial registers and makes race relevant to the provision of\nburdens or benefits, it demeans us all.\u201dGrutter,supra, at 353 (opinion of Thomas, J.). Therefore, as a\ngeneral rule, all race-based government decisionmaking\u2014regardless\nof context\u2014is unconstitutional.2This Court has carved out a\nnarrow exception to that general rule for cases in which a school\ndistrict has a \u201chistory of maintaining two sets of schools in a\nsingle school system deliberately operated to carry out a\ngovernmental policy to separate pupils in schools solely on the\nbasis of race.\u201d[Footnote 4] SeeSwann, 402 U. S., at 5\u20136. In such cases, race-based\nremedial measures are sometimes required.[Footnote 5]Green, 391 U. S., at 437\u2013438; cf.United Statesv.Fordice,505 U. S. 717, 745 (1992) (Thomas, J.,\nconcurring).[Footnote 6] But\nwithout a history of state-enforced racial separation, a school\ndistrict has no affirmative legal obligation to take race-based\nremedial measures to eliminate segregation and its vestiges.Neither of the programs before us\ntoday is compelled as a remedial measure, and no one makes such a\nclaim. Seattle has no history ofde juresegregation;\ntherefore, the Constitution did not require Seattle\u2019s\nplan.[Footnote 7] Although\nLouisville once operated a segregated school system and was subject\nto a Federal District Court\u2019s desegregation decree, seeante, at 7;Hamptonv.Jefferson Cty. Bd. of\nEd.,102 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d 358, 376\u2013377 (WD Ky. 2000), that\ndecree was dissolved in 2000,id., at 360. Since then, no\nrace-based remedial measures have been required in Louisville.\nThus, the race-based student-assignment plan at issue here, which\nwas instituted the year after the dissolution of the desegregation\ndecree, was not even arguably required by the Constitution.3Aside from constitutionally\ncompelled remediation in schools, this Court has permitted\ngovernment units to remedy prior racial discrimination only in\nnarrow circumstances. SeeWygantv.Jackson Bd. of\nEd.,476 U. S.\n267, 277 (1986) (plurality opinion). Regardless of the\nconstitutional validity of such remediation, seeCroson,supra, at 524\u2013525 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment), it\ndoes not apply here. Again, neither school board asserts that its\nrace-based actions were taken to remedy prior discrimination.\nSeattle provides three forward-looking\u2014as opposed to\nremedial\u2014justifications for its race-based assignment plan. Brief\nfor Respondents in No. 05\u2013908, pp. 24\u201334. Louisville asserts\nseveral similar forward-looking interests, Brief for Respondents in\nNo. 05\u2013915, pp. 24\u201329, and at oral argument, counsel for Louisville\ndisavowed any claim that Louisville\u2019s argument \u201cdepend[ed] in any\nway on the prior de jure segregation,\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. in No.\n05\u2013915, p.\u00a038.Furthermore, for a government\nunit to remedy past discrimination for which it was responsible,\nthe Court has required it to demonstrate \u201ca \u2018strong basis in\nevidence for its conclusion that remedial action was\nnecessary.\u2019\u00a0\u201dCroson, 488 U. S., at 500 (quotingWygant,supra, at 277 (plurality opinion)).\nEstablishing a \u201cstrong basis in evidence\u201d requires proper findings\nregarding the extent of the government unit\u2019s past racial\ndiscrimination.Croson, 488 U. S., at 504. The findings\nshould \u201cdefine the scope of any injury [and] the necessary remedy,\u201did.,at 505, and must be more than \u201cinherently\nunmeasurable claims of past wrongs,\u201did.,at 506.\nAssertions of general societal discrimination are plainly\ninsufficient.Id.,at 499, 504;Wygant,supra, at 274 (plurality opinion); cf.Regents of\nUniv. of Cal.v.Bakke,438 U. S. 265, 310\n(1978) (opinion of Powell, J.). Neither school district has made\nany such specific findings. For Seattle, the dissent attempts to\nmake up for this failing by adverting to allegations made in past\ncomplaints filed against the Seattle school district. However,\nallegations in complaints cannot substitute for specific findings\nof prior discrimination\u2014even when those allegations lead to\nsettlements with complaining parties. Cf.Croson,supra, at 505;Wygant,supra, at 279,\nn.\u00a05 (plurality opinion). As for Louisville, its slate was\ncleared by the District Court\u2019s 2000 dissolution decree, which\neffectively declared that there were no longer any effects ofde jurediscrimination in need of remediation.[Footnote 8]Despite the dissent\u2019s repeated intimation of a\nremedial purpose, neither of the programs in question qualifies as\na permissible race-based remedial measure. Thus, the programs are\nsubject to the general rule that government race-based\ndecisionmaking is unconstitutional.CAs the foregoing demonstrates,\nracial balancing is sometimes a constitutionally permissible remedy\nfor the discrete legal wrong ofde juresegregation, and\nwhen directed to that end, racial balancing is an exception to the\ngeneral rule that government race-based decisionmaking is\nunconstitutional. Perhaps for this reason, the dissent conflates\nthe concepts of segregation and racial imbalance: If racial\nimbalance equates to segregation, then it must also be\nconstitutionally acceptable to use racial balancing to remedy\nracial imbalance.For at least two reasons,\nhowever, it is wrong to place the remediation of segregation on the\nsame plane as the remediation of racial imbalance. First, as\ndemonstrated above, the two concepts are distinct. Although racial\nimbalance can result fromde juresegregation, it does not\nnecessarily, and the further we get from the era of state-sponsored\nracial separation, the less likely it is that racial imbalance has\na traceable connection to any prior segregation. SeeFreeman, 503 U. S., at 496;Jenkins, 515 U. S.,\nat 118 (Thomas, J., concurring).Second, a school cannot \u201cremedy\u201d racial\nimbalance in the same way that it can remedy segregation.\nRemediation of pastde juresegregation is a one-time\nprocess involving the redress of a discrete legal injury inflicted\nby an identified entity. At some point, the discrete injury will be\nremedied, and the school district will be declared unitary. SeeSwann, 402 U. S., at 31. Unlikede juresegregation, there is no ultimate remedy for racial imbalance.\nIndividual schools will fall in and out of balance in the natural\ncourse, and the appropriate balance itself will shift with a school\ndistrict\u2019s changing demographics. Thus, racial balancing will have\nto take place on an indefinite basis\u2014a continuous process with no\nidentifiable culpable party and no discernable end point. In part\nfor those reasons, the Court has never permitted outright racial\nbalancing solely for the purpose of achieving a particular racial\nbalance.IILacking a cognizable interest in\nremediation, neither of these plans can survive strict scrutiny\nbecause neither plan serves a genuinely compelling state interest.\nThe dissent avoids reaching that conclusion by unquestioningly\naccepting the assertions of selected social scientists while\ncompletely ignoring the fact that those assertions are the subject\nof fervent debate. Ultimately, the dissent\u2019s entire analysis is\ncorrupted by the considerations that lead it initially to question\nwhether strict scrutiny should apply at all. What emerges is a\nversion of \u201cstrict scrutiny\u201d that combines hollow assurances of\nharmlessness with reflexive acceptance of conventional wisdom. When\nit comes to government race-based decisionmaking, the Constitution\ndemands more.AThe dissent claims that \u201cthe law\nrequires application here of a standard of review that is not\n\u2018strict\u2019 in the traditional sense of that word.\u201dPost, at\n36. This view is informed by dissents in our previous cases and the\nconcurrences of two Court of Appeals judges.Post,at\n34\u201336 (citing 426 F.\u00a03d 1162, 1193\u20131194 (CA9 2005) (Kozinski,\nJ., concurring);Comfortv.Lynn School Comm.,418 F.\u00a03d 1, 28\u201329 (CA1 2005) (Boudin, C.\u00a0J.,\nconcurring)). Those lower court judges reasoned that programs like\nthese are not \u201caimed at oppressing blacks\u201d and do not \u201cseek to give\none racial group an edge over another.\u201dComfort,supra, at 27 (Boudin, C.\u00a0J., concurring); 426\nF.\u00a03d, at 1193 (Kozinski, J., concurring). They were further\npersuaded that these plans differed from other race-based programs\nthis Court has considered because they are \u201ccertainly more benign\nthan laws that favor or disfavor one race, segregate by race, or\ncreate quotas for or against a racial group,\u201dComfort, 418\nF.\u00a03d, at 28 (Boudin, C.\u00a0J., concurring), and they are\n\u201cfar from the original evils at which the Fourteenth Amendment was\naddressed,\u201did.,at 29; 426 F.\u00a03d, at 1195 (Kozinski,\nJ., concurring). Instead of strict scrutiny, Judge Kozinski would\nhave analyzed the plans under \u201crobust and realistic rational basis\nreview.\u201dId.,at 1194.These arguments are inimical to\nthe Constitution and to this Court\u2019s precedents.[Footnote 9] We have made it unusually clear that\nstrict scrutiny applies toeveryracial classification.Adarand, 515 U. S., at 227;Grutter, 539 U. S.,\nat 326;Johnsonv.California,543 U. S. 499, 505 (2005) (\u201cWe have\ninsisted on strict scrutiny in every context, even for so-called\n\u2018benign\u2019 racial classifications\u201d).[Footnote 10] There are good reasons not to apply a lesser\nstandard to these cases. The constitutional problems with\ngovernment race-based decisionmaking are not diminished in the\nslightest by the presence or absence of an intent to oppress any\nrace or by the real or asserted well-meaning motives for the\nrace-based decisionmaking.Adarand, 515 U. S., at 228\u2013229.\nPurportedly benign race-based decisionmaking suffers the same\nconstitutional infirmity as invidious race-based decisionmaking.Id.,at 240 (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring\nin judgment) (\u201cAs far as the Constitution is concerned, it is\nirrelevant whether a government\u2019s racial classifications are drawn\nby those who wish to oppress a race or by those who have a sincere\ndesire to help those thought to be disadvantaged\u201d).Even supposing it mattered to the\nconstitutional analysis, the race-based student assignment programs\nbefore us are not as benign as the dissent believes. Seepost, at 34\u201335. \u201c[R]acial paternalism and its unintended\nconsequences can be as poisonous and pernicious as any other form\nof discrimination.\u201dAdarand,supra, at 241\n(opinion of Thomas, J.). As these programs demonstrate, every time\nthe government uses racial criteria to \u201cbring the races together,\u201dpost, at 29, someone gets excluded, and the person\nexcluded suffers an injury solely because of his or her race. The\npetitioner in the Louisville case received a letter from the school\nboard informing her that herkindergartenerwould not be\nallowed to attend the school of petitioner\u2019s choosing because of\nthe child\u2019s race. App. in No. 05\u2013915, p.\u00a097. Doubtless,\nhundreds of letters like this went out from both school boards\nevery year these race-based assignment plans were in operation.\nThis type of exclusion, solely on the basis of race, is precisely\nthe sort of government action that pits the races against one\nanother, exacerbates racial tension, and \u201cprovoke[s] resentment\namong those who believe that they have been wronged by the\ngovernment\u2019s use of race.\u201dAdarand,supra, at 241\n(opinion of Thomas, J.). Accordingly, these plans are simply one\nmore variation on the government race-based decisionmaking we have\nconsistently held must be subjected to strict scrutiny.Grutter,supra, at 326.BThough the dissent admits to\ndiscomfort in applying strict scrutiny to these plans, it claims to\nhave nonetheless applied that exacting standard. But in its search\nfor a compelling interest, the dissent casually accepts even the\nmost tenuous interests asserted on behalf of the plans, grouping\nthem all under the term \u201c\u00a0\u2018integration.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Seepost, at 37. \u201c\u00a0\u2018[I]ntegration,\u2019\u00a0\u201d we are told,\nhas \u201cthree essential elements.\u201dIbid.None of these\nelements is compelling. And the combination of the three\nunsubstantiated elements does not produce an interest any more\ncompelling than that represented by each element independently.1According to the dissent,\nintegration involves \u201can interest in setting right the consequences\nof prior conditions of segregation.\u201dPost, at 37. For the\nreasons explained above, the records in these cases do not\ndemonstrate that either school board\u2019s plan is supported by an\ninterest in remedying past discrimination. Part I\u2013B,supra.Moreover, the school boards have\nno interest in remedying the sundry consequences of prior\nsegregation unrelated to schooling, such as \u201chousing patterns,\nemployment practices, economic conditions, and social attitudes.\u201dPost, at 38. General claims that past school segregation\naffected such varied societal trends are \u201ctoo amorphous a basis for\nimposing a racially classified remedy,\u201dWygant, 476 U. S.,\nat 276 (plurality opinion), because \u201c[i]t is sheer speculation\u201d how\ndecades-past segregation in the school system might have affected\nthese trends, seeCroson, 488 U. S., at 499. Consequently,\nschool boards seeking to remedy those societal problems with\nrace-based measures in schools today would have no way to gauge the\nproper scope of the remedy.Id.,at 498. Indeed, remedial\nmeasures geared toward such broad and unrelated societal ills have\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018no logical stopping point,\u2019\u00a0\u201dibid., and\nthreaten to become \u201cageless in their reach into the past, and\ntimeless in their ability to affect the future,\u201dWygant,supra, at 276 (plurality opinion). SeeGrutter,\n539 U. S., at 342 (stating the \u201crequirement that all governmental\nuse of race must have a logical end point\u201d).Because the school boards lack any further\ninterest in remedying segregation, this element offers no support\nfor the purported interest in \u201cintegration.\u201d2Next, the dissent argues that the\ninterest in integration has an educational element. The dissent\nasserts that racially balanced schools improve educational outcomes\nfor black children. In support, the dissent unquestioningly cites\ncertain social science research to support propositions that are\nhotly disputed among social scientists. In reality, it is far from\napparent that coerced racial mixing has any educational benefits,\nmuch less that integration is necessary to black achievement.Scholars have differing opinions\nas to whether educational benefits arise from racial balancing.\nSome have concluded that black students receive genuine educational\nbenefits. See,e.g., Crain & Mahard, Desegregation and\nBlack Achievement: A Review of the Research, 42 L. & Contemp.\nProbs. 17, 48 (1978). Others have been more circumspect. See,e.g., Henderson, Greenberg, Schneider, Uribe, &\nVerdugo, High Quality Schooling for African American Students, in\nBeyond Desegregation 166 (M. Shujaa ed. 1996) (\u201cPerhaps\ndesegregation does not have a single effect, positive or negative,\non the academic achievement of African American students, but\nrather some strategies help, some hurt, and still others make no\ndifference whatsoever. It is clear to us that focusing simply on\ndemographic issues detracts from focusing on improving schools\u201d).\nAnd some have concluded that there are no demonstrable educational\nbenefits. See,e.g., Armor & Rossell, Desegregation\nand Resegregation in the Public Schools, in Beyond the Color Line:\nNew Perspectives on Race and Ethnicity in America 239, 251 (A.\nThernstrom & S. Thernstrom eds. 2002).Theamicusbriefs in the cases before\nus mirror this divergence of opinion. Supporting the school boards,\noneamicushas assured us that \u201cboth early desegregation\nresearch and recent statistical and econometric analyses \u2026 indicate\nthat there are positive effects on minority student achievement\nscores arising from diverse school settings.\u201d Brief for American\nEducational Research Association asAmicus Curiae10.\nAnother brief claims that \u201cschool desegregation has a modest\npositive impact on the achievement of African-American students.\u201d\nApp. to Brief for 553 Social Scientists asAmici Curiae13\u201314 (footnote omitted). Yet neither of those briefs contains\nspecific details like the magnitude of the claimed positive effects\nor the precise demographic mix at which those positive effects\nbegin to be realized. Indeed, the social scientists\u2019 brief rather\ncautiously claims the existence of any benefit at all, describing\nthe \u201cpositive impact\u201d as \u201cmodest,\u201did.,at 13,\nacknowledging that \u201cthere appears to be little or no effect on math\nscores,\u201did.,at 14, and admitting that the \u201cunderlying\nreasons for these gains in achievement are not entirely clear,\u201did.,at 15.[Footnote\n11]Otheramicidispute these findings.\nOneamicusreports that \u201c[i]n study after study, racial\ncomposition of a student body, when isolated, proves to be an\ninsignificant determinant of student achievement.\u201d Brief for Dr.\nJohn Murphy et\u00a0al. asAmici Curiaein No. 05\u2013908,\np.\u00a08; see alsoid., at 9 (\u201c[T]here is no evidence\nthat diversity in the K\u201312 classroom positively affects student\nachievement\u201d). Anotheramicussurveys several social\nscience studies and concludes that \u201ca fair and comprehensive\nanalysis of the research shows that there is no clear and\nconsistent evidence of [educational] benefits.\u201d Brief for David J.\nArmor et\u00a0al. asAmici Curiae29.Add to the inconclusive social science the\nfact of black achievement in \u201cracially isolated\u201d environments. See\nT. Sowell, Education: Assumptions Versus History 7\u201338 (1986).\nBeforeBrown, the most prominent example of an exemplary\nblack school was Dunbar High School.Id.,at 29 (\u201c[I]n the\nperiod 1918\u20131923, Dunbar graduates earned fifteen degrees from Ivy\nLeague colleges, and ten degrees from Amherst, Williams, and\nWesleyan\u201d). Dunbar is by no means an isolated example. Seeid.,at 10\u201332 (discussing other successful black schools);\nWalker, Can Institutions Care? Evidence from the Segregated\nSchooling of African American Children, in Beyond Desegregation\n209\u2013226 (M. Shujaa ed. 1996); see also T. Sowell, Affirmative\nAction Around the World: An Empirical Study 141\u2013165 (2004). Even\nafterBrown, some schools with predominantly black\nenrollments have achieved outstanding educational results. See,e.g., S. Carter, No Excuses: Lessons from 21\nHigh-Performing, High-Poverty Schools 49\u201350, 53\u201356, 71\u201373, 81\u201384,\n87\u201388 (2001); A. Thernstrom & S. Thernstrom, No Excuses:\nClosing the Racial Gap in Learning 43\u201364 (2003); see also L. Izumi,\nThey Have Overcome: High-Poverty, High-Performing Schools in\nCalifornia (2002) (chronicling exemplary achievement in\npredominantly Hispanic schools in California). There is also\nevidence that black students attending historically black colleges\nachieve better academic results than those attending predominantly\nwhite colleges.Grutter,supra, at 364\u2013365\n(Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (citing\nsources); see alsoFordice, 505 U. S., at 748\u2013749 (Thomas,\nJ., concurring).The Seattle school board itself must believe\nthat racial mixing is not necessary to black achievement. Seattle\noperates a K\u20138 \u201cAfrican-American Academy,\u201d which has a \u201cnonwhite\u201d\nenrollment of 99%. See App. in No. 05\u2013908, p.\u00a0227a; Reply\nBrief in No. 05\u2013908, p.\u00a013, n.\u00a013. That school was\nfounded in 1990 as part of the school board\u2019s effort to \u201cincrease\nacademic achievement.\u201d[Footnote\n12] See African American Academy History, online at http://www.\nseattleschools.org/schools/aaa/history.htm (all Internet materials\nas visited June 26, 2007, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case\nfile). According to the school\u2019s most recent annual report,\n\u201c[a]cademic excellence\u201d is its \u201cprimary goal.\u201d See African American\nAcademy 2006 Annual Report, p.\u00a02, online at\nhttp://www.seattleschools.org/area/\nsiso/reports/anrep/altern/938.pdf. This racially imbalanced\nenvironment has reportedly produced test scores \u201chigher across all\ngrade levels in reading, writing and math.\u201dIbid.Contrary\nto what the dissent would have predicted, seepost, at\n38\u201339, the children in Seattle\u2019s African American Academy have\nshown gains when placed in a \u201chighly segregated\u201d environment.Given this tenuous relationship between forced\nracial mixing and improved educational results for black children,\nthe dissent cannot plausibly maintain that an educational element\nsupports the integration interest, let alone makes it\ncompelling.[Footnote 13] SeeJenkins, 515 U. S., at 121\u2013122 (Thomas, J., concurring)\n(\u201c[T]here is no reason to think that black students cannot learn as\nwell when surrounded by members of their own race as when they are\nin an integrated environment\u201d).Perhaps recognizing as much, the dissent\nargues that the social science evidence is \u201cstrong enough to permit\na democratically elected school board reasonably to determine that\nthis interest is a compelling one.\u201dPost, at 38. This\nassertion is inexplicable. It is not up to the school boards\u2014the\nvery government entities whose race-based practices we must\nstrictly scrutinize\u2014to determine what interests qualify as\ncompelling under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States\nConstitution. Rather, this Court must assess independently the\nnature of the interest asserted and the evidence to support it in\norder to determine whether it qualifies as compelling under our\nprecedents. In making such a determination, we have deferred to\nstate authorities only once, seeGrutter, 539 U. S., at\n328\u2013330, and that deference was prompted by factors uniquely\nrelevant to higher education.Id.,at 328 (\u201cOur holding\ntoday is in keeping with our tradition of giving a degree of\ndeference to a university\u2019s academic decisions\u201d). The dissent\u2019s\nproposed test\u2014whether sufficient social science evidence supports a\ngovernment unit\u2019s conclusion that the interest it asserts is\ncompelling\u2014calls to mind the rational-basis standard of review the\ndissent purports not to apply,post, at 36-37. SeeWilliamsonv.Lee Optical of Okla., Inc.,348 U. S. 483,\n488 (1955) (\u201cIt is enough that there is an evil at hand for\ncorrection, and that it might be thought that the particular\nlegislative measure was a rational way to correct it\u201d).\nFurthermore, it would leave our equal-protection jurisprudence at\nthe mercy of elected government officials evaluating the evanescent\nviews of a handful of social scientists. To adopt the dissent\u2019s\ndeferential approach would be to abdicate our constitutional\nresponsibilities.[Footnote\n14]3Finally, the dissent asserts a\n\u201cdemocratic element\u201d to the integration interest. It defines the\n\u201cdemocratic element\u201d as \u201can interest in producing an educational\nenvironment that reflects the \u2018pluralistic society\u2019 in which our\nchildren will live.\u201dPost, at 39.[Footnote 15] Environmental reflection, though,\nis just another way to say racial balancing. And \u201c[p]referring\nmembers of any one group for no reason other than race or ethnic\norigin is discrimination for its own sake.\u201dBakke, 438 U.\nS., at 307 (opinion of Powell, J.). \u201cThis the Constitution\nforbids.\u201dIbid.;Grutter,supra,at\n329\u2013330;Freeman, 503 U. S., at 494.Navigating around that\ninconvenient authority, the dissent argues that the racial\nbalancing in these plans is not an end in itself but is instead\nintended to \u201cteac[h] children to engage in the kind of cooperation\namong Americans of all races that is necessary to make a land of\nthree hundred million people one Nation.\u201dPost, at 39\u201340.\nThese \u201cgeneric lessons in socialization and good citizenship\u201d are\ntoo sweeping to qualify as compelling interests.Grutter,\n539 U. S., at 348 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and dissenting in\npart). And they are not \u201cuniquely relevant\u201d to schools or \u201cuniquely\n\u2018teachable\u2019 in a formal educational setting.\u201dId.,at 347.\nTherefore, if governments may constitutionally use racial balancing\nto achieve these aspirational ends in schools, they may use racial\nbalancing to achieve similar goals at every level\u2014from\nstate-sponsored 4\u2013H clubs, seeBazemorev.Friday,478\nU. S. 385, 388\u2013390 (1986) (Brennan, J., concurring), to the\nstate civil service. SeeGrutter,539 U. S. 347\u2013348\n(opinion of Scalia, J.).Moreover, the democratic interest has no\ndurational limit, contrary toGrutter\u2019s command. Seeid.,at 342; see alsoCroson, 488 U. S., at 498;Wygant, 476 U. S., at 275 (plurality opinion). In other\nwords, it will always be important for students to learn\ncooperation among the races. If this interest justifies\nrace-conscious measures today, then logically it will justify\nrace-conscious measures forever. Thus, the democratic interest,\nlimitless in scope and \u201ctimeless in [its] ability to affect the\nfuture,\u201did.,at 276 (plurality opinion), cannot justify\ngovernment race-based decisionmaking.[Footnote 16]In addition to these defects, the democratic\nelement of the integration interest fails on the dissent\u2019s own\nterms. The dissent again relies upon social science research to\nsupport the proposition that state-compelled racial mixing teaches\nchildren to accept cooperation and improves racial attitudes and\nrace relations. Here again, though, the dissent overstates the data\nthat supposedly support the interest.The dissent points to data that indicate that\n\u201cblack and white students in desegregated schools are less racially\nprejudiced than those in segregated schools.\u201dPost, at 40\n(internal quotation marks omitted). By the dissent\u2019s account,\nimprovements in racial attitudes depend upon the increased contact\nbetween black and white students thought to occur in more racially\nbalanced schools. There is no guarantee, however, that students of\ndifferent races in the same school will actually spend time with\none another. Schools frequently group students by academic ability\nas an aid to efficient instruction, but such groupings often result\nin classrooms with high concentrations of one race or another. See,e.g., Yonezawa, Wells, & Serna, Choosing Tracks:\n\u201cFreedom of Choice\u201d in Detracting Schools, 39 Am. Ed. Research J.,\nNo. 1, p.\u00a038 (Spring 2002); Mickelson, Subverting Swann:\nFirst- and Second-Generation Segregation in the\nCharlotte-Mecklenburg Schools, 38 Am. Ed. Research J., No. 2, pp.\n233\u2013234 (Summer 2001) (describing this effect in schools in\nCharlotte, North Carolina). In addition to classroom separation,\nstudents of different races within the same school may separate\nthemselves socially. See Hallinan & Williams, Interracial\nFriendship Choices in Secondary Schools, 54 Am. Sociological Rev.,\nNo. 1, pp. 72\u201376 (Feb. 1989); see also Clotfelter, Interracial\nContact in High School Extracurricular Activities, 34 Urban Rev.,\nNo. 1, pp. 41\u201343 (Mar. 2002). Therefore, even supposing interracial\ncontact leads directly to improvements in racial attitudes and race\nrelations, a program that assigns students of different races to\nthe same schools might not capture those benefits. Simply putting\nstudents together under the same roof does not necessarily mean\nthat the students will learn together or even interact.Furthermore, it is unclear whether increased\ninterracial contact improves racial attitudes and\nrelations.[Footnote 17] One\nresearcher has stated that \u201cthe reviews of desegregation and\nintergroup relations were unable to come to any conclusion about\nwhat the probable effects of desegregation were \u2026 [;] virtually all\nof the reviewers determined that few, if any, firm conclusions\nabout the impact of desegregation on intergroup relations could be\ndrawn.\u201d Schofield, School Desegregation and Intergroup Relations: A\nReview of the Literature, in 17 Review of Research in Education 356\n(G. Grant ed. 1991). Some studies have even found that a\ndeterioration in racial attitudes seems to result from racial\nmixing in schools. See N. St. John, School Desegregation Outcomes\nfor Children 67\u201368 (1975) (\u201cA glance at [the data] shows that for\neither race positive findings are less common than negative\nfindings\u201d); Stephan, The Effects of School Desegregation: An\nEvaluation 30 Years After Brown, in Advances in Applied Social\nPsychology 183\u2013186 (M. Saks & L. Saxe eds. 1986). Therefore, it\nis not nearly as apparent as the dissent suggests that increased\ninterracial exposure automatically leads to improved racial\nattitudes or race relations.Given our case law and the paucity of evidence\nsupporting the dissent\u2019s belief that these plans improve race\nrelations, no democratic element can support the integration\ninterest.[Footnote 18]4The dissent attempts to buttress\nthe integration interest by claiming that it followsa\nfortiorifrom the interest this Court recognized as compelling\ninGrutter.Post, at 41. Regardless of the merit\nofGrutter, the compelling interest recognized in that\ncase cannot support these plans.Grutterrecognized a\ncompelling interest in a law school\u2019s attainment of a diverse\nstudent body. 539 U. S., at 328. This interest was critically\ndependent upon features unique to higher education: \u201cthe expansive\nfreedoms of speech and thought associated with the university\nenvironment,\u201d the \u201cspecial niche in our constitutional tradition\u201d\noccupied by universities, and \u201c[t]he freedom of a university to\nmake its own judgments as to education[,] includ[ing] the selection\nof its student body.\u201dId.,at 329 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). None of these features is present in elementary and\nsecondary schools. Those schools do not select their own students,\nand education in the elementary and secondary environment generally\ndoes not involve the free interchange of ideas thought to be an\nintegral part of higher education. See 426 F.\u00a03d, at 1208\n(Bea, J., dissenting). ExtendingGrutterto this context\nwould require us to cut that holding loose from its theoretical\nmoorings. Thus, only by ignoringGrutter\u2019s reasoning can\nthe dissent claim that recognizing a compelling interest in these\ncases is ana fortioriapplication ofGrutter.CStripped of the baseless and\nnovel interests the dissent asserts on their behalf, the school\nboards cannot plausibly maintain that their plans further a\ncompelling interest. As I explained inGrutter, only\n\u201cthose measures the State must take to provide a bulwark against\nanarchy \u2026 or to prevent violence\u201d and \u201ca government\u2019s effort to\nremedy past discrimination for which it is responsible\u201d constitute\ncompelling interests. 539 U. S., at 351\u2013352, 353. Neither of the\nparties has argued\u2014nor could they\u2014that race-based student\nassignment is necessary to provide a bulwark against anarchy or to\nprevent violence. And as I explained above, the school districts\nhave no remedial interest in pursuing these programs. See Part I\u2013B,supra. Accordingly, the school boards cannot satisfy\nstrict scrutiny. These plans are unconstitutional.IIIMost of the dissent\u2019s criticisms\nof today\u2019s result can be traced to its rejection of the color-blind\nConstitution. Seepost, at 29. The dissent attempts to\nmarginalize the notion of a color-blind Constitution by consigning\nit to me and Members of today\u2019s plurality.[Footnote 19] Seeibid.;see alsopost,at 61. But I am quite comfortable in the company I\nkeep. My view of the Constitution is Justice Harlan\u2019s view inPlessy:\u201cOur Constitution is color-blind, and neither\nknows nor tolerates classes among citizens.\u201dPlessyv.Ferguson,163 U. S. 537, 559 (1896) (dissenting\nopinion). And my view was the rallying cry for the lawyers who\nlitigatedBrown. See,e.g., Brief for Appellants\ninBrownv.Board of Education, O.\u00a0T. 1953,\nNos. 1, 2, and 4 p.\u00a065 (\u201cThat the Constitution is color blind\nis our dedicated belief\u201d); Brief for Appellants inBrownv.Board of Education, O.\u00a0T. 1952, No. 1, p.\u00a05\n(\u201cThe Fourteenth Amendment precludes a state from imposing\ndistinctions or classifications based upon race and color\nalone\u201d);[Footnote 20] see\nalso In Memoriam: Honorable Thurgood Marshall, Proceedings of the\nBar and Officers of the Supreme Court of the United States, X\n(1993) (remarks of Judge Motley) (\u201cMarshall had a \u2018Bible\u2019 to which\nhe turned during his most depressed moments. The \u2018Bible\u2019 would be\nknown in the legal community as the first Mr. Justice Harlan\u2019s\ndissent inPlessyv.Ferguson,163 U. S. 537, 552 (1896). I do not\nknow of any opinion which buoyed Marshall more in his\npre-Browndays \u2026\u201d).The dissent appears to pin its\ninterpretation of the Equal Protection Clause to current societal\npractice and expectations, deference to local officials, likely\npractical consequences, and reliance on previous statements from\nthis and other courts. Such a view was ascendant in this Court\u2019s\njurisprudence for several decades. It first appeared inPlessy,where the Court asked whether a state law\nproviding for segregated railway cars was \u201ca reasonable\nregulation.\u201d 163 U. S., at 550. The Court deferred to local\nauthorities in making its determination, noting that in inquiring\ninto reasonableness \u201cthere must necessarily be a large discretion\non the part of the legislature.\u201dIbid.The Court likewise\npaid heed to societal practices, local expectations, and practical\nconsequences by looking to \u201cthe established usages, customs and\ntraditions of the people, and with a view to the promotion of their\ncomfort, and the preservation of the public peace and good order.\u201dIbid.Guided by these principles, the Court concluded:\n\u201c[W]e cannot say that a law which authorizes or even requires the\nseparation of the two races in public conveyances is unreasonable,\nor more obnoxious to the Fourteenth Amendment than the acts of\nCongress requiring separate schools for colored children in the\nDistrict of Columbia.\u201dId.,at 550\u2013551.The segregationists inBrownembraced\nthe arguments the Court endorsed inPlessy. ThoughBrowndecisively rejected those arguments, today\u2019s dissent\nreplicates them to a distressing extent. Thus, the dissent argues\nthat \u201c[e]ach plan embodies the results of local experience and\ncommunity consultation.\u201dPost, at 47. Similarly, the\nsegregationists made repeated appeals to societal practice and\nexpectation. See,e.g., Brief for Appellees on Reargument\ninBriggsv.Elliott, O.\u00a0T. 1953, No. 2, p.\n76 (\u201c[A] State has power to establish a school system which is\ncapable of efficient administration, taking into account local\nproblems and conditions\u201d).[Footnote 21] The dissent argues that \u201cweight [must be\ngiven] to a local school board\u2019s knowledge, expertise, and\nconcerns,\u201dpost, at 48, and with equal vigor, the\nsegregationists argued for deference to local authorities. See,e.g., Brief for Kansas on Reargument inBrownv.Board of Education, O.\u00a0T. 1953, No. 1, p.\u00a014\n(\u201cWe advocate only a concept of constitutional law that permits\ndeterminations of state and local policy to be made on state and\nlocal levels. We defend only the validity of the statute that\nenables the Topeka Board of Education to determine its own\ncourse\u201d).[Footnote 22] The\ndissent argues that today\u2019s decision \u201cthreatens to substitute for\npresent calm a disruptive round of race-related litigation,\u201dpost, at 2, and claims that today\u2019s decision \u201crisks\nserious harm to the law and for the Nation,\u201dpost,at 65.\nThe segregationists also relied upon the likely practical\nconsequences of ending the state-imposed system of racial\nseparation. See,e.g., Brief for Appellees on Reargument\ninDavisv.County School Board, O.\u00a0T. 1953,\nNo. 3, p.\u00a037 (\u201cYet a holding that school segregation by race\nviolates the Constitution will result in upheaval in all of those\nplaces not now subject to Federal judicial scrutiny. This Court has\nmade many decisions of widespread effect; none would affect more\npeople more directly in more fundamental interests and, in fact,\ncause more chaos in local government than a reversal of the\ndecision in this case\u201d).[Footnote 23] And foreshadowing today\u2019s dissent, the\nsegregationists most heavily relied upon judicial precedent. See,e.g., Brief for Appellees on Reargument inBriggsv.Elliott, O.\u00a0T. 1953, No. 2, p. 59 (\u201c[I]t would be\ndifficult indeed to find a case so favored by precedent as is the\ncase for South Carolina here\u201d).[Footnote 24]The similarities between the dissent\u2019s\narguments and the segregationists\u2019 arguments do not stop there.\nLike the dissent, the segregationists repeatedly cautioned the\nCourt to consider practicalities and not to embrace too theoretical\na view of the Fourteenth Amendment.[Footnote 25] And just as the dissent argues that the need\nfor these programs will lessen over time, the segregationists\nclaimed that reliance on segregation was lessening and might\neventually end.[Footnote\n26]What was wrong in 1954 cannot be right\ntoday.[Footnote 27] Whatever\nelse the Court\u2019s rejection of the segregationists\u2019 arguments inBrownmight have established, it certainly made clear that\nstate and local governments cannot take from the Constitution a\nright to make decisions on the basis of race by adverse possession.\nThe fact that state and local governments had been discriminating\non the basis of race for a long time was irrelevant to theBrownCourt. The fact that racial discrimination was\npreferable to the relevant communities was irrelevant to theBrownCourt. And the fact that the state and local\ngovernments had relied on statements in this Court\u2019s opinions was\nirrelevant to theBrownCourt. The same principles guide\ntoday\u2019s decision. None of the considerations trumpeted by the\ndissent is relevant to the constitutionality of the school boards\u2019\nrace-based plans because no contextual detail\u2014or collection of\ncontextual details,post, at 2\u201322\u2014can \u201cprovide refuge from\nthe principle that under our Constitution, the government may not\nmake distinctions on the basis of race.\u201dAdarand, 515 U.\nS., at 240 (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in\njudgment).[Footnote 28]In place of the color-blind Constitution, the\ndissent would permit measures to keep the races together and\nproscribe measures to keep the races apart.[Footnote 29] Seepost, at 28\u201334,\n64\u201365. Although no such distinction is apparent in the Fourteenth\nAmendment, the dissent would constitutionalize today\u2019s faddish\nsocial theories that embrace that distinction. The Constitution is\nnot that malleable. Even if current social theories favor classroom\nracial engineering as necessary to \u201csolve the problems at hand,\u201dpost, at 21, the Constitution enshrines principles\nindependent of social theories. SeePlessy, 163 U. S., at\n559 (Harlan, J., dissenting) (\u201cThe white race deems itself to be\nthe dominant race in this country. And so it is, in prestige, in\nachievements, in education, in wealth and in power. So, I doubt\nnot, it will continue to be for all time \u2026\u00a0. But in view of\nthe Constitution, in the eye of the law, there is in this country\nno superior, dominant, ruling class of citizens. \u2026 Our Constitution\nis color-blind, and neither knows nor tolerates classes among\ncitizens\u201d). Indeed, if our history has taught us anything, it has\ntaught us to beware of elites bearing racial theories.[Footnote 30] See,e.g.,Dred Scottv.Sandford, 19 How. 393, 407 (1857)\n(\u201c[T]hey [members of the \u201cnegro African race\u201d] had no rights which\nthe white man was bound to respect\u201d). Can we really be sure that\nthe racial theories that motivatedDred ScottandPlessyare a relic of the past or that future theories\nwill be nothing but beneficent and progressive? That is a gamble I\nam unwilling to take, and it is one the Constitution does not\nallow.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*The plans before us base school\nassignment decisions on students\u2019 race. Because \u201c[o]ur Constitution\nis color-blind, and neither knows nor tolerates classes among\ncitizens,\u201d such race-based decisionmaking is unconstitutional.Plessy,supra,at 559 (Harlan, J., dissenting). I\nconcur in the Chief Justice\u2019s opinion so holding.Footnote 1In this Court\u2019s paradigmatic segregation\ncases, there was a local ordinance, state statute, or state\nconstitutional provision requiring racial separation. See,e.g., Brief for Petitioners inBollingv.Sharpe, O.\u00a0T. 1952, No. 4, pp.\u00a028\u201330 (cataloging\nstate laws requiring separa- tion of the races);id.,at\nApp. A (listing \u201cStatutory and Consti- tutional Provisions in the\nStates Where Segregation in Education is Institutionalized\u201d).Footnote 2The dissent refers repeatedly and reverently\nto \u201c\u00a0\u2018integration.\u2019\u00a0\u201d However, outside of the context of\nremediation for pastde juresegregation, \u201cintegration\u201d is\nsimply racial balancing. Seepost, at 37. Therefore, the\nschool districts\u2019 attempts to further \u201cintegrate\u201d are properly\nthought of as little more than attempts to achieve a particular\nracial balance.Footnote 3The dissent\u2019s assertion that these plans are\nnecessary for the school districts to maintain their \u201chard-won\ngains\u201d reveals its conflation of segregation and racial imbalance.Post, at 38. For the dissent\u2019s purposes, the relevant\nhard-won gains are the present racial compositions in the\nindividual schools in Seattle and Louisville. However, the actual\nhard-won gain in these cases is the elimination of the vestiges of\nthe system of state-enforced racial separation that once existed in\nLouisville. To equate the achievement of a certain statistical mix\nin several schools with the elimination of the system of systematicde juresegregation trivializes the latter accomplishment.\nNothing but an interest in classroom aesthetics and a\nhypersensitivity to elite sensibilities justifies the school\ndistricts\u2019 racial balancing programs. See Part II\u2013B,infra. But \u201cthe principle of inherent equality that\nunderlies and infuses our Constitution\u201d required the\ndisestablishment ofde juresegregation. SeeAdarand\nConstructors, Inc.v.Pe&nacute;a,515 U. S. 200, 240 (1995) (Thomas, J.,\nconcurring in part and concurring in judgment). Assessed in any\nobjective manner, there is no comparison between the two.Footnote 4The dissent makes much of the supposed\ndifficulty of determining whether prior segregation wasde\njureorde facto. See,e.g.,post,\nat 19\u201320. That determination typically will not be nearly as\ndifficult as the dissent makes it seem. In most cases, there either\nwill or will not have been a state constitutional amendment, state\nstatute, local ordinance, or local administrative policy explicitly\nrequiring separation of the races. See,e.g., n.\u00a01,supra. And even if the determination is difficult, it is\none the dissent acknowledges must be made to determine what\nremedies school districts are required to adopt.Post, at\n43.Footnote 5This Court\u2019s opinion inMcDanielv.Barresi,402\nU. S. 39(1971), fits comfortably within this framework. There,\na Georgia school board voluntarily adopted a desegregation plan. At\nthe time ofBrown, v.Board of Education,347 U. S. 483(1954), Georgia\u2019s\nConstitution required that \u201c[s]eparate schools shall be provided\nfor the white and colored races.\u201d Ga. Const., Art.\u00a0VII, \u00a71,\nch. 2\u20136401 (1948). Given that state law had previously required the\nschool board to maintain a dual school system, the county was\nobligated to take measures to remedy its priorde juresegregation. This Court recognized as much in its opinion, which\nstated that the school board had an \u201caffirmative duty to\ndisestablish the dual school system.\u201dMcDaniel,supra, at 41.Footnote 6As I have explained elsewhere, the remedies\nthis Court authorized lower courts to compel in early desegregation\ncases likeGreenandSwannwere exceptional. SeeMissouriv.Jenkins,515 U. S. 70, 124\u2013125 (1995), (Thomas,\nJ., concurring). Sustained resistance toBrownprompted\nthe Court to authorize extraordinary race-conscious remedial\nmeasures (like compelled racial mixing) to turn the Constitution\u2019s\ndictate to desegregate into reality. 515 U. S., at 125 (Thomas, J.,\nconcurring). Even if these measures were appropriate as remedies in\nthe face of widespread resistance toBrown\u2019s mandate, they\nare not forever insulated from constitutional scrutiny. Rather,\n\u201csuch powers should have been temporary and used only to overcome\nthe widespread resistance to the dictates of the Constitution.\u201d 515\nU. S., at 125 (Thomas, J., concurring).Footnote 7Though the dissent cites every manner of\ncomplaint, record material, and scholarly article relating to\nSeattle\u2019s race-based student assignment efforts,post, at\n73\u201375, it cites no law or official policy that required separation\nof the races in Seattle\u2019s schools. Nevertheless, the dissent tries\nto cast doubt on the historical fact that the Seattle schools were\nnever segregated by law by citing allegations that the National\nAssociation for the Advancement of Colored People and other\norganizations made in court filings to the effect that Seattle\u2019s\nschools were once segregated by law. Seepost, at 7\u20139, 23.\nThese allegations were never proved and were not even made in this\ncase. Indeed, the record before us suggests the contrary. See App.\nin No. 05\u2013908, pp.\u00a0214a, 225a, 257a. Past allegations in\nanother case provide no basis for resolving these cases.Footnote 8Contrary to the dissent\u2019s argument,post, at 44, the Louisville school district\u2019s interest in\nremedying its pastde juresegregation did vanish the day\nthe District Court found that Louisville had eliminated the\nvestiges of its historicde juresegregation. SeeHamptonv.Jefferson Cty. Bd. of Ed.,102\nF.\u00a0Supp. 2d 358, at 360 (WD Ky. 2000). If there were further\nremediation to be done, the District Court could not logically have\nreached the conclusion that Louisville \u201cha[d] eliminated the\nvestiges associated with the former policy of segregation and its\npernicious effects.\u201dIbid.Because Louisville could use\nrace-based measures only as a remedy for pastde juresegregation, it is not \u201cincoherent,\u201dpost, at 56, to say\nthat race-based decisionmaking was allowed to Louisville one\nday\u2014while it was still remedying\u2014and forbidden to it the next\u2014when\nremediation was finished. That seemingly odd turnaround is merely a\nresult of the fact that the remediation ofde juresegregation is a jealously guarded exception to the Equal\nProtection Clause\u2019s general rule against government race-based\ndecisionmaking.Footnote 9The dissent\u2019s appeal tostare\ndecisis,post, at 65, is particularly ironic in light\nof its apparent willingness to depart from these precedents,post, at 36\u201337.Footnote 10The idea that government racial\nclassifications must be subjected to strict scrutiny did not\noriginate inAdarand. As early asLovingv.Virginia,388\nU. S. 1(1967), this Court made clear that government action\nthat \u201crest[s] solely upon distinctions drawn according to race\u201d had\nto be \u201csubjected to the \u2018most rigid scrutiny.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId.,at 11 (quotingKorematsuv.United States,323 U. S. 214,\n216 (1944)); see alsoMcLaughlinv.Florida,379 U. S. 184,\n196 (1964) (requiring a statute drawing a racial classification to\nbe \u201cnecessary, and not merely rationally related, to accomplishment\nof a permissible state policy\u201d);id.,at 197 (Harlan, J.,\nconcurring) (\u201cThe necessity test \u2026 should be equally applicable in\na case involving state racial discrimination\u201d).Footnote 11At least one of the academic articles the\ndissent cites to support this proposition fails to establish a\ncausal connection between the supposed educational gains realized\nby black students and racial mixing. See Hallinan, Diversity\nEffects on Student Outcomes: Social Science Evidence, 59 Ohio St.\nL.\u00a0J. 733 (1998). In the pages following the ones the dissent\ncites, the author of that article remarks that \u201cthe main reason\nwhite and minority students perform better academically in majority\nwhite schools is likely that these schools provide greater\nopportunities to learn. In other words, it is not desegregation per\nse that improves achievement, but rather the learning advantages\nsome desegregated schools provide.\u201dId.,at 744. Evidence\nthat race is a good proxy for other factors that might be\ncorrelated with educational benefits does not support a compelling\ninterest in the use of race to achieve academic results.Footnote 12Of course, if the Seattle school board were\ntruly committed to the notion that diversity leads directly to\neducational benefits, operating a school with such a high\n\u201cnonwhite\u201d enrollment would be a shocking dereliction of its duty\nto educate the students enrolled in that school.Footnote 13In fact, the available data from the Seattle\nschool district appear to undercut the dissent\u2019s view. A comparison\nof the test results of the schools in the last year the racial\nbalancing program operated to the results in the 2004-to-2005\nschool year (in which student assignments were race-neutral) does\nnot indicate the decline in black achieve- ment one would expect to\nfind if black achievement were contin- gent upon a particular\nracial mix.

Seepost, at 62. Regardless of what Justice\nBreyer\u2019s goals might be, this Court does not sit to \u201ccreate a\nsociety that includes all Americans\u201d or to solve the problems of\n\u201ctroubled inner city schooling.\u201dIbid.We are not social\nengineers. The United States Constitution dictates that local\ngovernments cannot make decisions on the basis of race.\nConsequently, regardless of the perceived negative effects of\nracial imbalance, I will not defer to legislative majorities where\nthe Constitution forbids it.It should escape no one that behind Justice\nBreyer\u2019s veil of judicial modesty hides an inflated role for the\nFederal Judiciary. The dissent\u2019s approach confers on judges the\npower to say what sorts of discrimination are benign and which are\ninvidious. Having made that determination (based on no objective\nmeasure that I can detect), a judge following the dissent\u2019s\napproach will set the level of scrutiny to achieve the desired\nresult. Only then must the judge defer to a democratic majority. In\nmy view, to defer to one\u2019s preferred result is not to defer at\nall.Footnote 15The notion that a \u201cdemocratic\u201d interest\nqualifies as a compelling interest (or constitutes a part of a\ncompelling interest) is proposed for the first time in today\u2019s\ndissent and has little basis in the Constitution or our precedent,\nwhich has narrowly restricted the interests that qualify as\ncompelling. SeeGrutterv.Bollinger,539 U. S. 306, 351\u2013354 (2003) (Thomas,\nJ., concurring in part and dissenting in part). The Fourteenth\nAmendment does not enact the dissent\u2019s newly minted understanding\nof liberty. SeeLochnerv.New York,198 U. S. 45, 75 (1905)\n(Holmes, J., dissenting) (\u201cThe Fourteenth Amendment does not enact\nMr. Herbert Spencer\u2019s Social Statics\u201d).Footnote 16The dissent does not explain how its\nrecognition of an interest in teaching racial understanding and\ncooperation here is consistent with the Court\u2019s rejection of a\nsimilar interest inWygant. InWygant, a school\ndistrict justified its race-based teacher-layoff program in part on\nthe theory that \u201cminority teachers provided \u2018role models\u2019 for\nminority students and that a racially \u2018diverse\u2019 faculty would\nimprove the education of all students.\u201dGrutter,supra, at 352 (opinion of Thomas, J.) (citing Brief for\nRespondents, O.\u00a0T. 1984, No. 84\u20131340, pp. 27\u201328; 476 U. S., at\n315 (Stevens, J., dissenting)). The Court rejected the interests\nasserted to justify the layoff program as insufficiently\ncompelling.Wygant,476 U. S., at 275\u2013276 (plurality\nopinion);id.,at 295 (White, J., concurring in judgment).\nIf a school district has an interest in teaching racial\nunderstanding and cooperation, there is no logical reason why that\ninterest should not extend to the composition of the teaching staff\nas well as the composition of the student body. The dissent\u2019s\nreliance on this interest is, therefore, inconsistent withWygant.Footnote 17Outside the school context, this Court\u2019s\ncases reflect the fact that racial mixing does not always lead to\nharmony and understanding. InJohnsonv.California,543 U. S. 499(2005), this Court\nconsidered a California prison policy that separated inmates\nracially.Id.,at 525\u2013528 (Thomas, J., dissenting). That\npolicy was necessary because of \u201cnumerous incidents of racial\nviolence.\u201dId.,at 502;id., at 532\u2013534 (Thomas,\nJ., dissenting). As a result of this Court\u2019s insistence on strict\nscrutiny of that policy, but seeid.,at 538\u2013547, inmates\nin the California prisons were killed. SeeBeardv.Banks, 548 U. S. ___, ___ (2006) (Thomas, J., concurring\nin judgment) (noting that two were killed and hundreds were injured\nin race rioting subsequent to this Court\u2019s decision inJohnson).Footnote 18After discussing the \u201cdemocratic element,\u201d\nthe dissent repeats its assertion that the social science evidence\nsupporting that interest is \u201csufficiently strong to permit a school\nboard to determine \u2026 that this interest is compelling.\u201dPost, at 40. Again, though, the school boards have no say\nin deciding whether an interest is compelling. Strict scrutiny of\nrace-based government decisionmaking is more searching thanChevron-style administrative review for reasonableness.\nSeeChevron U. S.\u00a0A. Inc.v.Natural Resources\nDefense Council, Inc.,467 U. S. 837, 845\n(1984).Footnote 19The dissent half-heartedly attacks the\nhistorical underpinnings of the color-blind Constitution.Post, at 28\u201329. I have no quarrel with the proposition\nthat the Fourteenth Amendment sought to bring former slaves into\nAmerican society as full members.Post,at 28 (citingSlaughter-House Cases, 16 Wall. 36, 71\u201372 (1873)). What\nthe dissent fails to understand, however, is that the color-blind\nConstitution does not bar the government from taking measures to\nremedy past state-sponsored discrimination\u2014indeed, it requires that\nsuch measures be taken in certain circumstances. See,e.g., Part I\u2013B,supra.Race-based government\nmeasures during the 1860\u2019s and 1870\u2019s to remedystate-enforced\nslaverywere therefore not inconsistent with the color-blind\nConstitution.Footnote 20See also Juris.

While this Court has permitted\nthe States to legislate or otherwise officially act experimentally\nin the social and economic fields, it has always recognized and\nheld that this power is subject to the limitations of the\nConstitution, and that the tests of the Constitution must be met\u201d);\nReply Brief for Appellants inBriggsv.Elliott,\nO.\u00a0T. 1953, No. 2, pp.\u00a018\u201319 (\u201cThe truth of the matter is\nthat this is an attempt to place local mores and customs above the\nhigh equalitarian principles of our Government as set forth in our\nConstitution and particularly the Fourteenth Amendment. This entire\ncontention is tantamount to saying that the vindication and\nenjoyment of constitutional rights recognized by this Court as\npresent and personal can be postponed whenever such postponement is\nclaimed to be socially desirable\u201d).Footnote 29The dissent does not face the complicated\nquestions attending its proposed standard. For example, where does\nthe dissent\u2019s principle stop? Can the government force racial\nmixing against the will of those being mixed? Can the government\nforce black families to relocate to white neighborhoods in the name\nif bringing the races together? What about historically black\ncolleges, which have \u201cestablished traditions and programs that\nmight disproportionately appeal to one race or another\u201d?United\nStatesv.Fordice,505 U. S. 717, 749 (1992) (Thomas, J.,\nconcurring). The dissent does not and cannot answer these questions\nbecause the contours of the distinction it propounds rest entirely\nin the eye of the beholder.Footnote 30Justice Breyer\u2019s good intentions, which I do\nnot doubt, have the shelf life of Justice Breyer\u2019s tenure. Unlike\nthe dissenters, I am unwilling to delegate my constitutional\nresponsibilities to local school boards and allow them to\nexperiment with race-based decisionmaking on the assumption that\ntheir intentions will forever remain as good as Justice Breyer\u2019s.\nSee The Federalist No. 51, p. 349 (J. Cooke ed. 1961) (\u201cIf men were\nangels, no government would be necessary\u201d). Indeed, the racial\ntheories endorsed by the Seattle school board should cause the\ndissenters to question whether local school boards should be\nentrusted with the power to make decisions on the basis of race.\nThe Seattle school district\u2019s Website formerly contained the\nfollowing definition of \u201ccultural racism\u201d: \u201cThose aspects of\nsociety that overtly and covertly attribute value and normality to\nwhite people and whiteness, and devalue, stereotype, and label\npeople of color as \u2018other,\u2019 different, less than, or render them\ninvisible. Examples of these norms include defining white skin\ntones as nude or flesh colored, having a future time orientation,\nemphasizing individualism as opposed to a more collective ideology,\ndefining one form of English as standard . . .\u00a0.\u201d See Harrell,\nSchool Web Site Removed: Examples of Racism Sparked Controversy,\nSeattle Post-Intelligencer, June 2, 2006, p. B1. After the site was\nremoved, the district offered the comforting clarification that the\nsite was not intended \u201c\u00a0\u2018to hold onto unsuccessful concepts\nsuch as melting pot or colorblind mentality.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIbid.;see alsoante, at 22, n.\u00a015\n(plurality opinion).More recently, the school district sent a\ndelegation of high school students to a \u201cWhite Privilege\nConference.\u201d See Equity and Race Relations White Privilege\nConference, https://www.seattleschools.\norg/area/equityandrace/whiteprivilegeconference.xml. One conference\nparticipant described \u201cwhite privilege\u201d as \u201can invisible package of\nunearned assets which I can count on cashing in each day, but about\nwhich I was meant to remain oblivious. White Privilege is like an\ninvisible weightless knapsack of special provisions, maps,\npassports, codebooks, visas, clothes, tools, and blank checks.\u201d See\nWhite Privilege Conference, Questions and Answers,\nhttp://www.uccs.edu/~wpc/ faqs.htm; see generally Westneat, School\nDistrict\u2019s Obsessed with Race, Seattle Times, Apr. 1, 2007, p. B1\n(describing racial issues in Seattle schools).",
