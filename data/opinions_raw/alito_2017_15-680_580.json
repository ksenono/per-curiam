The districting plan at issue here was adopted prior to our\ndecision inShelby Countyv.Holder, 570 U.\u00a0S.\n___ (2013), and therefore it is appropriate to apply the body of\nlaw in effect at that time. What is more, appellants have never\ncontested the District Court\u2019s holding that compliance with \u00a75 of\nthe Voting Rights Act was a compelling government interest for\ncovered jurisdictions before our decision inShelby County.\nSee 141 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d 505, 545\u2013547 (ED Va. 2015).I concur in the judgment of the Court insofar as\nit vacates and remands the judgment below with respect to all the\nremaining districts. Unlike the Court, however, I would hold that\nall these districts must satisfy strict scrutiny. Seepost,\nat 1\u20132 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting\nin part); see alsoLeague of United Latin American Citizensv.Perry, 548 U.\u00a0S. 399, 517 (2006) (Scalia, J.,\nconcurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part) (\u201c[W]hen a\nlegislature intentionally creates a majority-minority district,\nrace is necessarily its predominant motivation and strict scrutiny\nis therefore triggered\u201d).",
