S. ____ (2009)SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESNOS. 07-1428 AND 08-328FRANK RICCI, et\u00a0al., PETITIONERS07\u20131428v.JOHN DeSTEFANO et\u00a0al.FRANK RICCI, et\u00a0al., PETITIONERS08\u2013328v.JOHN DeSTEFANO et\u00a0al.on writs of certiorari to the united states court\nof appeals for the second circuit[June 29, 2009]Justice Alito, with whom Justice\nScalia and Justice Thomas join, concurring.I join the Court\u2019s opinion in\nfull. I write separately only because the dissent, while claiming\nthat \u201c[t]he Court\u2019s recitation of the facts leaves out important\nparts of the story,\u201dpost,at 2 (opinion of\nGinsburg,\u00a0J.), provides an incomplete description of the\nevents that led to New Haven\u2019s decision to reject the results of\nits exam. The dissent\u2019s omissions are important because, when all\nof the evidence in the record is taken into account, it is clear\nthat, even if the legal analysis in Parts II and III\u2013A of the\ndissent were accepted, affirmance of the decision below is\nuntenable.IWhen an employer in a\ndisparate-treatment case under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of\n1964 claims that an employment decision, such as the refusal to\npromote, was based on a legitimate reason, two questions\u2014one\nobjective and one subjective\u2014must be decided. The first, objective\nquestion is whether the reason given by the employer is one that is\nlegitimate under Title VII. SeeSt. Mary\u2019s Honor Centerv.Hicks,509\nU. S. 502, 506\u2013507 (1993). If the reason provided by the\nemployer is not legitimate on its face, the employer is liable.Id., at 509. The second, subjective question concerns the\nemployer\u2019s intent. If an employer offers a facially legitimate\nreason for its decision but it turns out that this explanation was\njust a pretext for discrimination, the employer is again liable.\nSeeid., at 510\u2013512.The question on which the opinion\nof the Court and the dissenting opinion disagree concerns the\nobjective component of the determination that must be made when an\nemployer justifies an employment decision, like the one made in\nthis litigation, on the ground that a contrary decision would have\ncreated a risk of disparate-impact liability. The Court holds\u2014and I\nentirely agree\u2014that concern about disparate-impact liability is a\nlegitimate reason for a decision of the type involved here only if\nthere was a \u201csubstantial basis in evidence to find the tests\ninadequate.\u201dAnte, at 26. The Court ably demonstrates that\nin this litigation no reasonable jury could find that the city of\nNew Haven (City) possessed such evidence and therefore summary\njudgment for petitioners is required. Because the Court correctly\nholds that respondents cannot satisfy this objective component, the\nCourt has no need to discuss the question of the respondents\u2019\nactual intent. As the Court puts it, \u201c[e]ven if respondents were\nmotivated as a subjective matter by a desire to avoid committing\ndisparate-impact discrimination, the record makes clear there is no\nsupport for the conclusion that respondents had an objective,\nsubstantial basis in evidence to find the tests inadequate.\u201dIbid.The dissent advocates a different objective\ncomponent of the governing standard. According to the dissent, the\nobjective component should be whether the evidence provided \u201cgood\ncause\u201d for the decision,post, at 19, and the dissent\nargues\u2014incorrectly, in my view\u2014that no reasonable juror could fail\nto find that such evidence was present here. But even if the\ndissent were correct on this point, I assume that the dissent would\nnot countenance summary judgment for respondents if respondents\u2019\nprofessed concern about disparate-impact litigation was simply a\npretext. Therefore, the decision below, which sustained the entry\nof summary judgment for respondents, cannot be affirmed unless no\nreasonable jury could find that the City\u2019s asserted reason for\nscrapping its test\u2014concern about disparate-impact liability\u2014was a\npretext and that the City\u2019s real reason was illegitimate, namely,\nthe desire to placate a politically important racial\nconstituency.IIAAs initially described by the\ndissent, seepost, at 2\u201312, the process by which the City\nreached the decision not to accept the test results was open,\nhonest, serious, and deliberative. But even the District Court\nadmitted that \u201ca jury could rationally infer that city officials\nworked behind the scenes to sabotage the promotional examinations\nbecause they knew that, were the exams certified, the Mayor would\nincur the wrath of [Rev. Boise] Kimber and other influential\nleaders of New Haven\u2019s African-American community.\u201d 554\nF.\u00a0Supp. 2d 142, 162 (Conn. 2006), summarily aff\u2019d, 530\nF.\u00a03d 87 (CA2 2008)(per curiam).This admission finds ample\nsupport in the record. Reverend Boise Kimber, to whom the District\nCourt referred, is a politically powerful New Haven pastor and a\nself-professed \u201c\u00a0\u2018kingmaker.\u2019\u00a0\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. in\nNo. 07\u20131428, p. 906a; see alsoid., at 909a. On one\noccasion, \u201c[i]n front of TV cameras, he threatened a race riot\nduring the murder trial of the black man arrested for killing white\nYalie Christian Prince. He continues to call whites racist if they\nquestion his actions.\u201dId., at 931a.Reverend Kimber\u2019s personal ties with\nseven-term New Haven Mayor John DeStefano (Mayor) stretch back more\nthan a decade. In 1996, for example, Mayor DeStefano testified for\nRev. Kimber as a character witness when Rev. Kimber\u2014then the\nmanager of a funeral home\u2014was prosecuted and convicted for stealing\nprepaid funeral expenses from an elderly woman and then lying about\nthe matter under oath. Seeid., at 126a, 907a. \u201cReverend\nKimber has played a leadership role in all of Mayor DeStefano\u2019s\npolitical campaigns, [and] is considered a valuable political\nsupporter and vote-getter.\u201dId., at 126a. According to the\nMayor\u2019s former campaign manager (who is currently his executive\nassistant), Rev. Kimber is an invaluable political asset because\n\u201c[h]e\u2019s very good at organizing people and putting together field\noperations, as a result of his ties to labor, his prominence in the\nreligious community and his long-standing commitment to roots.\u201dId., at 908a (internal quotation marks and alteration\nomitted).In 2002, the Mayor picked Rev. Kimber to serve\nas the Chairman of the New Haven Board of Fire Commissioners (BFC),\n\u201cdespite the fact that he had no experience in the profession, fire\nadministration, [or] municipal management.\u201dId., at 127a;\nsee alsoid., at 928a\u2013929a. In that capacity, Rev. Kimber\ntold firefighters that certain new recruits would not be hired\nbecause \u201c\u00a0\u2018they just have too many vowels in their\nname[s].\u2019\u00a0\u201d Thanawala, New Haven Fire Panel Chairman Steps\nDown Over Racial Slur, Hartford Courant, June 13, 2002, p. B2.\nAfter protests about this comment, Rev. Kimber stepped down as\nchairman of the BFC,ibid.;see also App. to Pet. for\nCert. in No. 07\u20131428, at 929a, but he remained on the BFC and\nretained \u201ca direct line to the mayor,\u201did., at 816a.Almost immediately after the test results were\nrevealed in \u201cearly January\u201d 2004, Rev. Kimber called the City\u2019s\nChief Administrative Officer, Karen Dubois-Walton, who \u201cacts \u2018on\nbehalf of the Mayor.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId., at 221a, 812a.\nDubois-Walton and Rev. Kimber met privately in her office because\nhe wanted \u201cto express his opinion\u201d about the test results and \u201cto\nhave some influence\u201d over the City\u2019s response.Id., at\n815a\u2013816a. As discussed in further detail below, Rev. Kimber\nadamantly opposed certification of the test results\u2014a fact that he\nor someone in the Mayor\u2019s office eventually conveyed to the Mayor.Id., at 229a.BOn January 12, 2004, Tina Burgett\n(the director of the City\u2019s Department of Human Resources) sent an\ne-mail to Dubois-Walton to coordinate the City\u2019s response to the\ntest results. Burgett wanted to clarify that the City\u2019s executive\nofficials would meet \u201csans the Chief, and that once we had a better\nfix on the next steps we would meet with the Mayor (possibly) and\nthen the two Chiefs.\u201dId., at 446a. The \u201ctwo Chiefs\u201d are\nFire Chief William Grant (who is white) and Assistant Fire Chief\nRonald Dumas (who is African-American). Both chiefs believed that\nthe test results should be certified.Id., at 228a, 817a.\nPetitioners allege, and the record suggests, that the Mayor and his\nstaff colluded \u201csans the Chief[s]\u201d because \u201cthe defendants did not\nwant Grant\u2019s or Dumas\u2019 views to be publicly known; accordingly both\nmen were prevented by the Mayor and his staff from making any\nstatements regarding the matter.\u201dId., at 228a.[Footnote 1]The next day, on January 13,\n2004, Chad Legel, who had designed the tests, flew from Chicago to\nNew Haven to meet with Dubois-Walton, Burgett, and Thomas Ude, the\nCity\u2019s corporate counsel.Id., at 179a. \u201cLegel outlined\nthe merits of the examination and why city officials should be\nconfident in the validity of the results.\u201dIbid.But\naccording to Legel, Dubois-Walton was \u201cargumentative\u201d and\napparently had already made up her mind that the tests were\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018discriminatory.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId., at 179a\u2013180a. Again\naccording to Legel, \u201c[a] theme\u201d of the meeting was \u201cthe political\nand racial overtones of what was going on in the City.\u201dId., at 181a. \u201cLegel came away from the January 13, 2004\nmeeting with the impression that defendants were already leaning\ntoward discarding the examination results.\u201dId., at\n180a.On January 22, 2004, the Civil Service Board\n(CSB or Board) convened its first public meeting. Almost\nimmediately, Rev. Kimber began to exert political pressure on the\nCSB. He began a loud, minutes-long outburst that required the CSB\nChairman to shout him down and hold him out of order three times.\nSeeid., at 187a, 467a\u2013468a; see also App. in No.\n06\u20134996\u2013cv (CA2), pp. A703\u2013A705. Reverend Kimber protested the\npublic meeting, arguing that he and the other fire commissioners\nshould first be allowed to meet with the CSB in private. App. to\nPet. for Cert. in No. 07\u20131428, at 188a.Four days after the CSB\u2019s first meeting, Mayor\nDeStefano\u2019s executive aide sent an e-mail to Dubois-Walton,\nBurgett, and Ude.Id., at 190a. The message clearly\nindicated that the Mayor had made up his mind to oppose\ncertification of the test results (but nevertheless wanted to\nconceal that fact from the public):\u201cI wanted to make sure we are all on the same page\nfor this meeting tomorrow\u2026\u00a0.[L]et\u2019s remember, that these\nfolks are not against certification yet. So we can\u2019t go in and tell\nthem that is our position;we have to deliberate and arrive\nthere as the fairest and most cogent outcome.\u201dIbid.On February 5, 2004, the CSB\nconvened its second public meeting. Reverend Kimber again testified\nand threatened the CSB with political recriminations if they voted\nto certify the test results:\u201cI look at this [Board] tonight. I look at\nthree whites and one Hispanic and no blacks\u2026\u00a0. I would hope\nthat you would not put yourself in this type of position, a\npolitical ramification that may come back upon youas you sit\non this [Board] and decide the future of a department and the\nfuture of those who are being promoted..\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003.\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003.\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003.\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003.\u201c(APPLAUSE).\u201dId., at 492a (emphasis added).One of the CSB members \u201ct[ook] great offense\u201d\nbecause he believed that Rev. Kimber \u201cconsider[ed] [him] a bigot\nbecause [his] face is white.\u201dId., at 496a. The offended\nCSB member eventually voted not to certify the test results.Id., at 586a\u2013587a.One of Rev. Kimber\u2019s \u201cfriends and allies,\u201d\nLieutenant Gary Tinney, also exacerbated racial tensions before the\nCSB.Id., at 129a. After some firefighters applauded in\nsupport of certifying the test results, \u201cLt. Tinney exclaimed,\n\u2018Listen to the Klansmen behind us.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId., at\n225a.Tinney also has strong ties to the Mayor\u2019s\noffice. See,e.g.,id., at 129a\u2013130a, 816a\u2013817a.\nAfter learning that he had not scored well enough on the captain\u2019s\nexam to earn a promotion, Tinney called Dubois-Walton and arranged\na meeting in her office.Id., at 830a\u2013831a, 836a. Tinney\nalleged that the white firefighters had cheated on their exams\u2014an\naccusation that Dubois-Walton conveyed to the Board without first\nconducting an investigation into its veracity.Id., at\n837a\u2013838a; see also App. 164 (statement of CSB Chairman, noting the\nallegations of cheating). The allegation turned out to be baseless.\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 07\u20131428, at 836a.Dubois-Walton never retracted the cheating\nallegation, but she and other executive officials testified several\ntimes before the CSB. In accordance with directions from the\nMayor\u2019s office to make the CSB meetings appear deliberative, seeid., at 190a, executive officials remained publicly\nuncommitted about certification\u2014while simultaneously \u201cwork[ing] as\na team\u201d behind closed doors with the secretary of the CSB to devise\na political message that would convince the CSB to vote against\ncertification, seeid., at 447a. At the public CSB meeting\non March 11, 2004, for example, Corporation Counsel Ude bristled at\none board member\u2019s suggestion that City officials were recommending\nagainst certifying the test results. Seeid., at 215a\n(\u201cAttorney Ude took offense, stating, \u2018Frankly, because I would\nnever make a recommendation\u2014I would not have made a recommendation\nlike that\u2019\u00a0\u201d). But within days of making that public\nstatement, Ude privately told other members of the Mayor\u2019s team\n\u201cthe ONLY way we get to a decision not to certify is\u201d to focus on\nsomething other than \u201ca big discussion re: adverse impact\u201d law.Id., at 458a\u2013459a.As part of its effort to deflect attention\nfrom the specifics of the test, the City relied heavily on the\ntestimony of Dr. Christopher Hornick, who is one of Chad Legel\u2019s\ncompetitors in the test-development business. Hornick never\n\u201cstud[ied] the test [that Legel developed] at length or in detail,\u201did., at 549a; see alsoid., at 203a, 553a, but\nHornick did review and rely upon literature sent to him by Burgett\nto criticize Legel\u2019s test. For example, Hornick \u201cnoted in the\nliterature that [Burgett] sent that the test was not customized to\nthe New Haven Fire Department.\u201dId., at 551a. The Chairman\nof the CSB immediately corrected Hornick.Id., at 552a\n(\u201cActually, it was, Dr. Hornick\u201d). Hornick also relied on newspaper\naccounts\u2014again, sent to him by Burgett\u2014pertaining to the\ncontroversy surrounding the certification decision. Seeid., at 204a, 557a. Although Hornick again admitted that\nhe had no knowledge about the actual test that Legel had developed\nand that the City had administered, seeid., at 560a\u2013561a,\nthe City repeatedly relied upon Hornick as a testing \u201cguru\u201d and, in\nthe CSB Chairman\u2019s words, \u201cthe City ke[pt] quoting him as a person\nthat we should rely upon more than anybody else [to conclude that\nthere] is a better way\u2014a better mousetrap.\u201d[Footnote 2] App. in No. 06\u20134996\u2013cv (CA2), at A1128.\nDubois-Walton later admitted that the City rewarded Hornick for his\ntestimony by hiring him to develop and administer an alternative\ntest. App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 07\u20131428, at 854a; see alsoid., at 562a\u2013563a (Hornick\u2019s plea for future business from\nthe City on the basis of his criticisms of Legel\u2019s tests).At some point prior to the CSB\u2019s public\nmeeting on March 18, 2004, the Mayor decided to use his executive\nauthority to disregard the test results\u2014even ifthe CSB\nultimately voted to certify them.Id., at 819a\u2013820a.\nAccordingly, on the evening of March 17th, Dubois-Walton sent an\ne-mail to the Mayor, the Mayor\u2019s executive assistant, Burgett, and\nattorney Ude, attaching two alternative press releases.Id., at 457a. The first would be issued if the CSB voted\nnot to certify the test results; the second would be issued (and\nwould explain the Mayor\u2019s invocation of his executive authority) if\nthe CSB voted to certify the test results.Id., at\n217a\u2013218a, 590a\u2013591a, 819a\u2013820a. Half an hour after Dubois-Walton\ncirculated the alternative drafts, Burgett replied: \u201c[W]ell, that\nseems to say it all. Let\u2019s hope draft #2 hits the shredder tomorrow\nnite.\u201dId., at 457a.Soon after the CSB voted against\ncertification, Mayor DeStefano appeared at a dinner event and \u201ctook\ncredit for the scu[tt]ling of the examination results.\u201dId., at 230a.CTaking into account all the\nevidence in the summary judgment record, a reasonable jury could\nfind the following. Almost as soon as the City disclosed the racial\nmakeup of the list of firefighters who scored the highest on the\nexam, the City administration was lobbied by an influential\ncommunity leader to scrap the test results, and the City\nadministration decided on that course of action before making any\nreal assessment of the possibility of a disparate-impact violation.\nTo achieve that end, the City administration concealed its internal\ndecision but worked\u2014as things turned out, successfully\u2014to persuade\nthe CSB that acceptance of the test results would be illegal and\nwould expose the City to disparate-impact liability. But in the\nevent that the CSB was not persuaded, the Mayor, wielding ultimate\ndecisionmaking authority, was prepared to overrule the CSB\nimmediately. Taking this view of the evidence, a reasonable jury\ncould easily find that the City\u2019s real reason for scrapping the\ntest results was not a concern about violating the disparate-impact\nprovision of Title VII but a simple desire to please a politically\nimportant racial constituency. It is noteworthy that the Solicitor\nGeneral\u2014whose position on the principal legal issue in this case is\nlargely aligned with the dissent\u2014concludes that \u201c[n]either the\ndistrict court nor the court of appeals \u2026 adequately considered\nwhether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to\npetitioners, a genuine issue of material fact remained whether\nrespondents\u2019 claimed purpose to comply with Title VII was a pretext\nfor intentional racial discrimination \u2026\u00a0.\u201d Brief for United\nStates asAmicusCuriae6; see alsoid.,at 32\u201333.IIII will not comment at length on\nthe dissent\u2019s criticism of my analysis, but two points require a\nresponse.The first concerns the dissent\u2019s\nstatement that I \u201cequat[e] political considerations with unlawful\ndiscrimination.\u201dPost, at 36. The dissent misrepresents my\nposition: I draw no such equation. Of course \u201cthere are many ways\nin which a politician can attempt to win over a\nconstituency\u2014including a racial constituency\u2014without engaging in\nunlawful discrimination.\u201dPost, at 36\u201337. But\u2014as I assume\nthe dissent would agree\u2014there are some things that a public\nofficial cannot do, and one of those is engaging in intentional\nracial discrimination when making employment decisions.The second point concerns the dissent\u2019s main\nargument\u2014that efforts by the Mayor and his staff to scuttle the\ntest results are irrelevant because the ultimate decision was made\nby the CSB. According to the dissent, \u201c[t]he relevant decision was\nmade by the CSB,\u201dpost, at 34, and there is \u201cscant cause\nto suspect\u201d that anything done by the opponents of certification,\nincluding the Mayor and his staff, \u201cprevented the CSB from\nevenhandedly assessing the reliability of the exams and rendering\nan independent, good-faith decision on certification,\u201dpost, at 36.Adoption of the dissent\u2019s argument would\nimplicitly decide an important question of Title VII law that this\nCourt has never resolved\u2014the circumstances in which an employer may\nbe held liable based on the discriminatory intent of subordinate\nemployees who influence but do not make the ultimate employment\ndecision. There is a large body of court of appeals case law on\nthis issue, and these cases disagree about the proper standard. SeeEEOCv.BCI Coca-Cola Bottling Co. of Los\nAngeles, 450 F.\u00a03d 476, 484\u2013488 (CA10 2006) (citing cases\nand describing the approaches taken in different Circuits). One\nstandard is whether the subordinate \u201cexerted influenc[e] over the\ntitular decisionmaker.\u201dRussellv.McKinney Hosp.\nVenture, 235 F.\u00a03d 219, 227 (CA5 2000); see alsoPolandv.Chertoff, 494 F.\u00a03d 1174, 1182\n(CA9 2007) (A subordinate\u2019s bias is imputed to the employer where\nthe subordinate \u201cinfluenced or was involved in the decision or\ndecisionmaking process\u201d). Another is whether the discriminatory\ninput \u201ccaused the adverse employment action.\u201d SeeBCI Coca-Cola\nBottling Co. of Los Angeles,supra, at 487.In the present cases, a reasonable jury could\ncertainly find that these standards were met. The dissent makes\nmuch of the fact that members of the CSB swore under oath that\ntheir votes were based on the good-faith belief that certification\nof the results would have violated federal law. Seepost,\nat 34. But the good faith of the CSB members would not preclude a\nfinding that the presentations engineered by the Mayor and his\nstaff influenced or caused the CSB decision.The least employee-friendly standard asks only\nwhether \u201cthe actual decisionmaker\u201d acted with discriminatory\nintent, seeHillv.Lockheed Martin Logistics\nManagement, Inc., 354 F.\u00a03d 277, 291 (CA4 2004) (en\nbanc), and it is telling that, even under this standard, summary\njudgment for respondents would not be proper. This is so because a\nreasonable jury could certainly find that in New Haven, the\nMayor\u2014not the CSB\u2014wielded the final decisionmaking power. After\nall, the Mayor claimed that authority and was poised to use it in\nthe event that the CSB decided to accept the test results. Seesupra, at 9. If the Mayor had the authority to overrule a\nCSB decisionacceptingthe test results, the Mayor also\npresumably had the authority to overrule the CSB\u2019s decisionrejectingthe test results. In light of the Mayor\u2019s\nconduct, it would be quite wrong to throw out petitioners\u2019 case on\nthe ground that the CSB was the ultimate decisionmaker.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*Petitioners are firefighters who\nseek only a fair chance to move up the ranks in their chosen\nprofession. In order to qualify for promotion, they made personal\nsacrifices. Petitioner Frank Ricci, who is dyslexic, found it\nnecessary to \u201chir[e] someone, at considerable expense, to read onto\naudiotape the content of the books and study materials.\u201d App. to\nPet. for Cert. in No. 07\u20131428, at 169a. He \u201cstudied an average of\neight to thirteen hours a day \u2026\u00a0, even listening to audio\ntapes while driving his car.\u201dIbid.Petitioner Benjamin\nVargas, who is Hispanic, had to \u201cgive up a part-time job,\u201d and his\nwife had to \u201ctake leave from her own job in order to take care of\ntheir three young children while Vargas studied.\u201dId., at\n176a. \u201cVargas devoted countless hours to study \u2026\u00a0, missed two\nof his children\u2019s birthdays and over two weeks of vacation time,\u201d\nand \u201cincurred significant financial expense\u201d during the three-month\nstudy period.Id., at 176a\u2013177a.Petitioners were denied\npromotions for which they qualified because of the race and\nethnicity of the firefighters who achieved the highest scores on\nthe City\u2019s exam. The District Court threw out their case on summary\njudgment, even though that court all but conceded that a jury could\nfind that the City\u2019s asserted justification was pretextual. The\nCourt of Appeals then summarily affirmed that decision.The dissent grants that petitioners\u2019 situation\nis \u201cunfortunate\u201d and that they \u201cunderstandably attract this Court\u2019s\nsympathy.\u201dPost, at 1, 39. But \u201csympathy\u201d is not what\npetitioners have a right to demand. What they have a right to\ndemand is evenhanded enforcement of the law\u2014of Title VII\u2019s\nprohibition against discrimination based on race. And that is what,\nuntil today\u2019s decision, has been denied them.Footnote 1Although the dissent disputes it, seepost, at 33\u201334, n.\u00a017, the record certainly permits\nthe inference that petitioners\u2019 allegation is true. See App. to\nPet. for Cert. in No. 07\u20131428, pp. 846a\u2013851a (deposition of\nDubois-Walton).Footnote 2The City\u2019s heavy reliance on Hornick\u2019s\ntestimony makes the two chiefs\u2019 silence all the more striking. Seesupra, at 5. While Hornick knew little or nothing about\nthe tests he criticized, the two chiefs were involved \u201cduring the\nlengthy process that led to the devising of the administration of\nthese exams,\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 07\u20131428, at 847a,\nincluding \u201ccollaborating with City officials on the extensive job\nanalyses that were done,\u201d \u201cselection of the oral panelists,\u201d and\nselection of \u201cthe proper content and subject matter of the exams,\u201did., at 847a\u2013848a.",
