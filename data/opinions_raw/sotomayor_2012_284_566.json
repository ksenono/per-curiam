To that end, the Act provides a civil remedy\nentitling individuals adversely affected by certain agency\nmisconduct to recover \u201cactual damages\u201d sustained as a result of the\nunlawful action.Today the Court holds that \u201cactual damages\u201d is\nlimited to pecuniary loss. Consequently, individuals can no longer\nrecover what our precedents and common sense understand to be the\nprimary, and often only, damages sustained as a result of an\ninvasion of privacy, namely mental or emotional distress. That\nresult is at odds with the text, structure, and drafting history of\nthe Act. And it cripples the Act\u2019s core purpose of redressing and\ndeterring violations of privacy interests. I respectfully\ndissent.IThe majority concludes that \u201cactual damages\u201d\nin the civil-remedies provision of the Privacy Act allows recovery\nfor pecuniary loss alone. But it concedes that its interpretation\nis not compelled by the plain text of the statute or otherwise\nrequired by any other traditional tool of statu- tory\ninterpretation. And it candidly acknowledges that a contrary\nreading is not \u201cinconceivable.\u201dAnte,at 14. Yet be- cause\nit considers its reading of \u201cactual damages\u201d to be \u201cplausible,\u201d the\nmajority contends that the canon of sovereign immunity requires\nadoption of an interpretation most favorable to the Government.Ibid.The canon simply cannot bear the weight the\nmajority ascribes it. \u201cThe sovereign immunity canon is just that\u2014a\ncanon of construction. It is a tool for interpreting the law, and\nwe have never held that it displaces the other traditional tools of\nstatutory construction.\u201dRichlin Security Service Co.v.Chertoff,553 U.S.\n571, 589 (2008) (opinion of Alito, J.). Here, traditional tools\nof statutory construction\u2014the statute\u2019s text, structure, drafting\nhistory, and purpose\u2014provide a clear answer: The term \u201cactual\ndamages\u201d permits recovery for all injuries established by competent\nevidence in the record, whether pecuniary or nonpecuniary, and so\nencompasses damages for mental and emotional distress. There is no\nneed to seek refuge in a canon of construction, seeid.,at\n589\u2013590 (declining to rely on canon as there is \u201cno ambiguity left\nfor us to construe\u201d after application of \u201ctraditional tools of\nstatutory interpretation and considerations ofstare\ndecisis\u201d), much less one that has been used so haphazardly in\nthe Court\u2019s history, seeUnited Statesv.Nordic Village,\nInc.,503 U.S.\n30, 42 (1992) (Stevens, J., dissenting) (canon is \u201cnothing but\na judge-made rule that is sometimes favored and sometimes\ndisfavored\u201d) (collecting cases).It bears emphasis that we have said repeatedly\nthat, while \u201cwe should not take it upon ourselves toextendthe waiver [of sovereign immunity] beyond that which Congress\nintended,\u201d \u201c[n]either .\u00a0.\u00a0. should we assume the\nauthority tonarrowthe waiver that Congress intended.\u201dUnited Statesv.Kubrick,444\nU.S. 111, 117\u2013118 (1979) (emphasis added). See also,e.g.,Blockv.Neal,460\nU.S. 289, 298 (1983) (\u201cThe exemption of the sovereign from suit\ninvolves hardship enough where consent has been withheld. We are\nnot to add to its rigor by refinement of construction where consent\nhas been announced\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). In the\nPrivacy Act, Congress expressly authorized recovery of \u201cactual\ndamages\u201d for certain intentional or willful agency misconduct. The\nCourt should not \u201cas a self-constituted guardian of the Treasury\nimport immunity back into a statute designed to limit it.\u201dIndian Towing Co.v.United States,350 U.S.\n61, 69 (1955).IIA\u201cIn a statutory construction case, the\nbeginning point must be the language of the statute, and when a\nstatute speaks with clarity to an issue judicial inquiry into the\nstatute\u2019s meaning, in all but the most extraordinary circumstance,\nis finished.\u201dEstate of Cowartv.Nicklos Drilling\nCo.,505 U.S.\n469, 475 (1992). The language of the civil-remedies provision\nof the Privacy Act is clear.At the time Congress drafted the Act, Black\u2019s\nLaw Dictionary defined \u201cactual damages\u201d as \u201c[r]eal, substantial and\njust damages, or the amount awarded to a complainant in\ncompensation for his actual and real loss or in- jury\u201d and as\n\u201c[s]ynonymous with \u2018compensatory damages.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Black\u2019s Law\nDictionary 467 (rev. 4th ed. 1968) (hereinafter Black\u2019s). The\nmajority claims this is a \u201cgeneral\u201d and \u201cnotably circular\u201d\ndefinition,ante, at 7, but it is unclear why. The\ndefinition is plain enough: \u201cActual damages\u201d compensate for actual\ninjury, and thus the term is synonymous with compensatory damages.\nSee Black\u2019s 467 (defining \u201ccompensatory damages\u201d as damages that\n\u201cwill compensate the injured party for the injury sustained, and\nnothing more; such as will simply make good or replace the loss\ncaused by the wrong or injury\u201d).[1] There is nothing circular about that\ndefinition.[2] It is the\ndefinition this Court adopted more than a century ago when we\nrecognized that \u201c[c]ompensatory damages and actual damages mean the\nsame thing; that is, that the damages shall be the result of the\ninjury alleged and proved, and that the amount awarded shall be\nprecisely commensurate with the injury suffered.\u201dBirdsallv.Coolidge,93 U.S. 64(1876). It is the definition embraced in current legal\ndictionaries. See Black\u2019s 445 (9th ed. 2009) (defining \u201cactual\ndamages\u201d as \u201c[a]n amount awarded to a complainant to compensate for\na proven injury or loss; damages that repay actual losses.\u2014Also\ntermed compensatory damages; tangible damages; real damages\u201d\n(italics omitted)). And it is the definition that accords with the\nplain and ordinary meaning of the term. See Webster\u2019s Third New\nInternational Dictionary 22, 571 (2002) (defining \u201cactual\u201d as\n\u201cexisting in fact or reality\u201d and \u201cdamages\u201d as \u201ccompensation or\nsatisfaction imposed by law for a wrong or injury caused by a\nviolation of a legal right\u201d). Thus, both as a term of art\nand in its plain meaning, \u201cactual damages\u201d connotes compensation\nfor proven injuries or losses. Nothing in the use of that phrase\nindicates proven injuries need be pecuniary in nature.The majority discards all this on the asserted\nground that \u201cthe precise meaning of the term \u2018changes with the\nspecific statute in which it is found.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAnte,at 7\n(quoting 622 F.3d 1016, 1029 (CA9 2010)). Context, of course, is\nrelevant to statutory interpretation; it may provide clues that\nCongress did not employ a word or phrase in its ordinary meaning.\nThat well-established interpretive rule cannot, however, render\nirrelevant\u2014as the majority would have it\u2014the ordinary meaning of\n\u201cactual damages.\u201dMoreover, the authority the majority cites for\nits claim that \u201cactual damages\u201d has no fixed meaning\nundermines\u2014rather than supports\u2014its holding. Each cited authority\ninvolves either a statute in which Congress expressly directed that\ncompensation be measured in strictly economic terms, or else a\nstatute (e.g., the Copyright Act of 1909) in which economic\nloss is the natural and probable consequence of a violation of the\ndefined legal interest.[3]\nNeither factor is present here. Notably absent from the Privacy Act\nis any provision so much as hinting that \u201cactual damages\u201d should be\nlimited to economic loss. And while \u201c\u00a0\u2018 \u201churt feelings\u201d over\nthe nature of the [copyright] infringement\u2019\u00a0\u201d may \u201chave no\nplace in the actual damages calculus\u201d under the Copyright Act of\n1909,ante,at 8 (quoting in parentheticalMackiev.Rieser,296 F.3d 909,917(CA9 2002)), the majority provides no basis for concluding\nthat \u201churt feelings\u201d are equally invalid in an Act concerned with\nsafeguarding individual privacy. Thus, while context is no doubt\nrelevant, the majority\u2019s cited authority does little to help its\ncause in the stated context of this statute.BIndeed, the relevant statutory context\u2014the\nsubstantive provisions whose breach may trigger suit under the\ncivil-remedies provision\u2014only reinforces the ordinary meaning of\n\u201cactual damages.\u201dCongress established substantive duties in the\nAct that are expressly designed to prevent agency conduct resulting\nin intangible harms to the individual. The Act requires agencies to\n\u201cestablish appropriate administrative, technical, and physical\nsafeguards\u201d to ensure against security breaches that could result\nin \u201csubstantial harm, embarrassment, inconvenience, or unfairness\nto any individual.\u201d 5 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7552a(e)(10). It also\nrequires agencies to \u201cmaintain all records\u201d used in making a\ndetermination about an individual in a manner that is \u201creasonably\nnecessary to assure fairness to the individual in the\ndetermination.\u201d \u00a7552a(e)(5). Thus an agency violates the terms of\nthe Act if it fails,e.g.,to maintain safeguards protecting\nagainst \u201cembarrassment\u201d; there is no additional requirement that\nthe pocketbook be implicated. An agency\u2019s intentional or willful\nviolation of those duties triggers liability for \u201cactual damages\u201d\nunder \u00a7552a(g)(4) in the event of an adverse impact.\n\u00a7\u00a7552a(g)(1)(C)\u2013(D), (g)(4).Adopting a reading of \u201cactual damages\u201d that\npermits recovery for pecuniary loss alone creates a disconnect\nbetween the Act\u2019s substantive and remedial provisions. It allows a\nswath of Government violations to go unremedied: A federal agency\ncould intentionally or willfully forgo establishing safeguards to\nprotect against embarrassment and no successful private action\ncould be taken against it for the harm Congress identified. Only an\ninterpretation of \u201cactual damages\u201d that permits recovery for\nnonpecuniary harms harmonizes the Act\u2019s substantive and remedial\nprovisions.Robinsonv.Shell Oil Co.,519 U.S.\n337, 341 (1997) (statutory interpretation must consider \u201cthe\nbroader context of the statute as a whole\u201d).[4]The majority draws a different conclusion from\nthe substantive provisions of the Privacy Act. It (correctly) in-\nfers from them that the Act \u201cserves interests similar to those\nprotected by defamation and privacy torts.\u201dAnte, at 9. It\nthen points to our observation inDoev.Chao,540 U.S.\n614, 625 (2004), that the Act\u2019s civil-remedies provision\n\u201cparallels\u201d the remedial scheme for the common-law torts of\ndefamationper quod, which permitted recovery of \u201cgeneral\ndamages\u201d (i.e., presumed damages) only if a plaintiff first\nestablishes \u201cspecial damages\u201d (i.e., monetary\nloss).[5]Ante, at 10.\nThat \u201cparallel,\u201d the majority concludes, \u201csuggests the possibility\nthat Congress intended the term \u2018actual damages\u2019 in the Act to mean\nspecial damages.\u201dAnte, at 11.The majority reads too much intoDoe. At\nissue in that case was the question whether the Act\u2019s civil-suit\nprovision authorized recovery of a guaranteed minimum award of\n$1,000 absent proof of some \u201cactual damages.\u201d The Court answered in\nthe negative, and in the course of doing so replied to petitioner\u2019s\nargument that there was \u201csomething peculiar in offering some\nguaranteed damages .\u00a0.\u00a0. only to those plaintiffs who can\ndemonstrate actual damages.\u201d 540 U.\u00a0S., at 625. Although the\nCourt cited the Act\u2019s parallels to defamationper quodactions in noting that nothing was \u201cpeculiar\u201d about the Act\u2019s\nremedial scheme,Doedid not take the further step of\ndeciding that \u201cactual damages\u201d means economic loss alone. Indeed,\nit expressly reserved that question.Id.,at 627,\nn.\u00a012.The majority, moreover, is wrong to conclude\nthat the Act\u2019s parallels with defamationper quodactions\nsuggest Congress intended \u201cactual damages\u201d to mean \u201cspecial\ndamages.\u201d Quite the opposite. The fact that Congress \u201cwould\nprobably have known about\u201d defamationper quodactions,id., at 625, makes it all the more significant that Congress\ndidnotwrite \u201cspecial damages\u201d in the civil-remedies\nprovision. This Court is typically not in the business of\nsubstituting words we think Congress in- tended to use for words\nCongress in fact used. Yet that is precisely what the majority does\nwhen it rewrites \u201cactual damages\u201d to mean \u201cspecial\ndamages.\u201d[6] In sum, the\nstatutory context, and in particular the Act\u2019s substantive\nprovisions, confirms the ordinary meaning of \u201cactual damages.\u201d\nAlthough the Act shares parallels with common-law defamation torts,\nsuch analogies do not warrant a reading of the phrase that is at\nodds with the statute\u2019s plain text.[7]CAn uncodified provision of the Act, tied to\nthe Act\u2019s drafting history, also reinforces the ordinary meaning of\n\u201cactual damages.\u201d As the majority notes, prior to reconciliation,\nthe Senate and House bills contained civil-remedies provisions that\nwere different in a critical respect: The Senate bill allowed for\nthe recovery of \u201cactual and general damages,\u201d whereas the House\nbill allowed for the recovery of \u201cactual damages\u201d alone.[8] In the reconciliation process, the\nprovision for \u201cgeneral damages\u201d was dropped and an uncodified\nsection of the Act was amended to require the newly established\nPrivacy Protection Study Commission to consider, among its other\njobs, \u201cwhether the Federal Government should be liable for general\ndamages incurred by an individual as the result of a willful or\nintentional violation of the provisions of sections 552a(g)(1)(C)\nor (D).\u201d \u00a75(c)(2)(B)(iii), 88Stat. 1907; see alsoDoe, 540\nU.\u00a0S., at 622.As the Court explained inDoe, \u201c[t]he\ndeletion of \u2018general damages\u2019 from the bill is fairly seen\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. as a deliberate elimination of any possibility of\nimputing harm and awarding presumed damages.\u201dId., at 623;\nsee alsoid.,at 622, n.\u00a05 (\u201cCongress explicitly\nrejected the proposal to make presumed damages available for\nPrivacy Act violations\u201d). The elimination of presumed damages from\nthe bill can only reasonably imply that what Congress left\nbehind\u2014\u201cactual damages\u201d\u2014comprised damages that are not presumed,i.e.,damages proven by competent evidence in the record.\nSeeGertzv.Robert Welch, Inc.,418 U.S.\n323, 349\u2013350 (1974) (distinguishing in defamation context\nbetween presumed damages and damages for actual injuries sustained\nby competent evidence in the record, which include \u201cimpairment of\nreputation and standing in the community, personal humiliation, and\nmental anguish and suffering\u201d);Careyv.Piphus,435 U.S.\n247, 262\u2013264 (1978) (distinguishing between presumed damages\nand proven damages for mental and emotional distress).Rather than view the deletion of general damages\n(presumed damages) as leaving the converse (proven damages), the\nmajority supposes that the deletion leaves only a subset of proven\ndamages\u2014those of an economic nature,i.e., \u201cspecial\ndamages.\u201d Once again, however, the majority\u2019s insistence that\n\u201cCongress intended \u2018actual damages\u2019 in the Privacy Act to mean\nspecial damages for proven pecuniary loss,\u201dante,at 13,\nfinds no basis in the statutory text, seesupra,at 8. And\nits response to the conclusion that Congress retained recovery for\nproven damages when it eliminated presumed damages is singularly\nunsatisfying. The majority declares such a conclusion \u201cflawed\u201d\nbecause \u201cgeneral damages\u201d \u201cincludes compensation for proven\ninjuries as well,\u201d so that \u201cwhat distinguishes [general] damages,\nwhether proved or not, from the only other category of compensatory\ndamages available in the relevant common-law suits is thetypeof harm\u201d the term encompasses\u2014which the majority takes\nto be emotional harm alone.Ante, at 15\u201316. That assertion\nis defective on two scores.First, a plaintiff\u2019s ability to\npresent proof of injury in a defamationper\u00a0seaction\n(and to recover for such proven injury) does not alter the\ndefinition of \u201cgeneral damages,\u201d which we already explained inDoemeans \u201cpresumed damages.\u201d 540 U.\u00a0S., at 621; see\nalsoid.,at 623; n.\u00a05,supra.Second,\n\u201cgeneral damages\u201d is not limited to a \u201ctype\u201d of harm. The\nmajority\u2019s contrary assertion that the term permits recovery only\nfor emotional \u201ctypes\u201d of harm overlooks the fact that \u201cgeneral\ndamages are partly based on the belief that the plaintiff will\nsuffer unprovablepecuniary losses.\u201d Dobbs \u00a77.2, at 514\n(emphasis added). It thus was established at common law that in a\ndefamationper\u00a0seaction, \u201cthe plaintiff is usually\nfree to prove whatever actual pecuniary loss he can,\u201d and \u201cthe jury\nmay be permitted to view the actual pecuniary loss proven as the\ntip of the iceberg, assume that there is still more un-proven, and\naward damage accordingly.\u201dIbid.At its core, the majority opinion relies on the\nfollowing syllogism: The common law employed two terms of art in\ndefamation actions. Because Congress excluded recovery for \u201cgeneral\ndamages,\u201d it must have meant to retain recovery only for \u201cspecial\ndamages.\u201d That syllogism, of course, ignores that thereisanother category of damages. It is the very category Congress used\nin the text of the Privacy Act: \u201cActual damages.\u201d However much\nCongress may have drawn \u201cparallels,\u201dante, at 10, between\nthe Act and the common-law tort of defamation, the fact remains\nthat Congress expressly choose not to use the words \u201cspecial\ndamages.\u201d[9]DI turn finally to the statute\u2019s purpose, for\n\u201c[a]s in all cases of statutory interpretation, our task is to\ninterpret the words of th[e] statut[e] in light of the purposes\nCongress sought to serve.\u201dChapmanv.Houston Welfare\nRights Organization,441 U.S.\n600, 608 (1979); see alsoDolanv.Postal\nService,546 U.S.\n481, 486 (2006) (\u201cInterpretation of a word or phrase depends\nupon reading the whole statutory text, considering the purpose and\ncontext of the statute, and consulting any precedents or\nauthorities that inform the analysis\u201d). The purposes of the Privacy\nAct could not be more explicit, and they are consistent with\ninterpreting \u201cactual damages\u201d according to its ordinary\nmeaning.\u201cThe historical context of the Act is important\nto an understanding of its remedial purposes. In 1974, Congress was\nconcerned with curbing the illegal surveillance and investigation\nof individuals by federal agencies that had been exposed during the\nWatergate scandal.\u201d Dept. of Justice, Office of Privacy and Civil\nLiberties, Overview of the Privacy Act\u00a04 (2010). In\nparticular, Congress recognized that \u201cthe increasing use of\ncomputers and sophisticated information technology .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nhas greatly magnified the harm to individual privacy that can occur\nfrom any collection, maintenance, use, or dissemination of personal\ninformation.\u201d \u00a72(a), 88Stat. 1896. Identifying the right to privacy\nas \u201ca personal and fundamental right,\u201d Congress found it \u201cnecessary\nand proper\u201d to enact the Privacy Act \u201cin order to protect the\nprivacy of individuals identified in information systems maintained\nby Federal agencies.\u201dIbid.Congress explained that the \u201cpurpose of this Act\nis to provide certain safeguards for an individual against an\ninvasion of personal privacy by requiring Federal agencies, except\nas otherwise provided by law, to,\u201dinter alia, \u201cbe subject\nto civil suit forany damageswhich occur as a result of\nwillful or intentional action which violates any individual\u2019s\nrights under this Act.\u201d \u00a72(b)(6),ibid.(emphasis added).\nThat statement is an explicit reference to suits brought under\n\u00a7552a(g)(4); no other provision speaks to a civil suit based on\n\u201cwillful or intentional\u201d agency misconduct. It signals unmistakably\ncongressional recognition that the civil-remedies provision is\nintegral to realizing the Act\u2019s purposes.Reading \u201cactual damages\u201d to permit recovery for\nany injury established by competent evidence in the\nrecord\u2014pecuniary or not\u2014best effectuates the statute\u2019s basic\npurpose. Although some privacy invasions no doubt result in\neconomic loss, we have recognized time and again that the primary\nform of injuries is nonpecuniary, and includes mental distress and\npersonal humiliation. SeeTime, Inc.v.Hill,385 U.S.\n374, 385, n. 9 (1967) (\u201cIn the \u2018right of privacy\u2019 cases the\nprimary damage is the mental distress\u201d); see alsoGertz, 418\nU.\u00a0S., at 350 (\u201c[A]ctual injury\u201d in defamatory falsehood cases\n\u201cis not limited to out-of-pocket loss. Indeed, the more customary\ntypes of actual harm inflicted by defamatory falsehood include\nimpairment of reputation and standing in the community, personal\nhumiliation, and mental anguish and suffering\u201d). Accord, 2 Dobbs\n\u00a77.1.(1), at 259 (2d ed. 1993) (privacy is a dignitary interest,\nand \u201cin a great many of the cases\u201d in which the interest is invaded\n\u201cthe only harm is the affront to the plaintiff\u2019s dignity as a human\nbeing, the damage to his self-image, and the resulting mental\ndistress\u201d). That accords with common sense.In interpreting the civil-remedies provision, we\nmust not forget Congress enacted the Privacy Act to protect pri-\nvacy. The majority\u2019s reading of \u201cactual damages\u201d renders the\nremedial provision impotent in the face of concededly unlawful\nagency action whenever the injury is solely nonpecuniary. That\nresult is patently at odds with Congress\u2019 stated purpose. The\nmajority, however, does not grapple with the ramifications of its\nopinion. It acknowledges the suggestion that its holding leads to\nabsurd results as it allows individuals suffering relatively minor\npecuniary losses to recover $1,000 while others suffering severe\nmental anguish to recover nothing. But it concludes that \u201cthere is\nnothing absurd about a scheme that limits the Government\u2019s Privacy\nAct liability to harm that can be substantiated by proof of\ntangible economic loss.\u201dAnte,at 18. Perhaps; it is\ncertainly within Congress\u2019 prerogative to enact the statute the\nmajority envisions, namely one that seeks to safeguard against\ninvasions of privacy without remedying the primary harm that\nresults from invasions of privacy. The problem for the majority is\nthat one looks in vain foranyindication in the text of the\nstatute before us that Congress intended such a result. Nowhere in\nthe Privacy Act does Congress so much as hint that it views a $5\nhit to the pocketbook as more worthy of remedy than debilitating\nmental distress, and the majority\u2019s contrary assumption discounts\nthe gravity of emotional harm caused by an invasion of the personal\nintegrity that privacy protects.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*After today, no matter how debilitating and\nsubstantial the resulting mental anguish, an individual harmed by a\nfederal agency\u2019s intentional or willful violation of the Privacy\nAct will be left without a remedy unless he or she is able to prove\npecuniary harm. That is not the result Congress intended when it\nenacted an Act with the express purpose of safeguarding individual\nprivacy against Government invasion. And it is not a result\nremotely suggested by anything in the text, structure, or history\nof the Act. For those reasons, I respectfully dissent.Notes1Black\u2019s Law Dictionary\nalso defined \u201cactual damages\u201d as synonymous with \u201cgeneral damages.\u201d\nBlack\u2019s 467. While \u201cgeneral damages\u201d has a specialized meaning of\npresumed damages in libel and slander cases, see n.\u00a04,infra, it more generally can mean damages that \u201cdid in fact\nresult from the wrong, directly and proximately.\u201d Black\u2019s\n468.2The majority declares the\ndefinition circular because \u201cdefining \u2018actual\u2019 damages by reference\nto \u2018actual\u2019 injury is hardly helpful when our task is to determine\nwhat Congress meant by \u2018actual.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAnte,at 9,\nn.\u00a04. \u201cActual injury,\u201d however, is far from an unhelpful\nreference. This Court already has recognized in the defamation\ncontext that \u201cactual injury is not limited to out-of-pocket loss.\u201dGertzv.Robert Welch, Inc.,418\nU.S. 323, 350 (1974). That accords with the definitions of the\nterms. See Black\u2019s 53, 924 (defining \u201cactual\u201d as \u201c[r]eal;\nsubstantial; existing presently in act, having a valid objective\nexistence as opposed to that which is merely theoretical or\npossible,\u201d and \u201cinjury\u201d as \u201c[a]ny wrong or damage done to\nanother\u201d).3See 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a72674; 17 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71009(d)(1); 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a72318(e)(3) (2006 ed., Supp. IV); 17 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7101(b)\n(1970 ed.); 15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a778bb(a) (2006 ed., Supp.\nIV).4It bears noting that the\nPrivacy Act does not authorize injunctive relief when a suit is\nmaintained under 5 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a7552a(g)(1)(C) and (D).\nRather, injunctive relief is available under the Act only for a\nlimited category of suits: suits to amend a record and suits for\naccess to a record. See \u00a7\u00a7552a(g)(2), (g)(3). Thus an individual\nwho, like petitioner, brings suit under subparagraph (g)(1)(C) or\n(D) for an inten-tional or willful violation of the Act will be\nwithout a remedy underthe majority\u2019s reading of \u201cactual\ndamages.\u201d5As the majority notes,\n\u201cgeneral damages\u201d at common law refers to damages \u201cpresumed\u201d to\naccrue from the violation of the legally pro-tected right. No proof\nof actual injury was required. See D. Dobbs, Law of Remedies \u00a77.2,\np. 513 (1973) (hereinafter Dobbs);Doe, 540 U.\u00a0S., at\n621. \u201cSpecial damages,\u201d in contrast, \u201cmeant monetary loss.\u201d Dobbs\n\u00a77.2, at 512;Doe, 540 U.\u00a0S., at 625. Common-law\ndefamation actions falling within the rubric of defamationper\u00a0seallowed successful plaintiffs to recover\n\u201cgeneral damages.\u201d See Dobbs \u00a77.2, at 513;Doe, 540\nU.\u00a0S., at 621. This stood in contrast to actions sounding in\ndefamationper quod, which permitted recovery only if the\nplaintiff established \u201cspecial damages.\u201d See Dobbs, \u00a77.2 at 512;Doe, 540 U.\u00a0S., at 625. Even in defamationper\nquodcases, a plaintiff could recover nonpecuniary injuries\nupon establishing some pecuniary loss. See Dobbs \u00a77.2, at 521;Doe, 540 U.\u00a0S., at 625. See alsoante, at\n10.6The majority cites a\ncollection of lower court opinions that have used \u201cactual damages\u201d\nin place of \u201cspecial damages\u201d to note that Congress would not have\nbeen alone in using the former term to refer to the latter.Ante,at 11\u201312. But that a handful of lower courts on\noccasion have been imprecise in their terminology provides no basis\nto assume the Legislature has been equally careless in the text of\na statute.7There is yet another flaw\nin the majority\u2019s reasoning. At common law a plaintiff who\nsuccessfully established \u201cspecial damages\u201d in an action for\ndefamationper quodcould proceed to recover damages for\nemotional and mental distress. Seeante, at 10; n.\u00a05,supra. If \u201cCongress intended the term \u2018actual damages\u2019 in\nthe Act to mean special damages,\u201dante, at 11, then an\nindividual who successfully establishes some pecuniary loss from a\nviolation of the Act\u2014presumably as trivial as the cost of a bottle\nof Tylenol\u2014should be permitted to recover for emotional and mental\ndistress. The majority, of course, does not accept that result, and\nits piecemeal embrace of the common law undermines its assertion\nthat Congress intended \u201cspecial damages\u201d in place of \u201cactual\ndamages.\u201d8See S. 3418, 93d Cong.,\n2d Sess., \u00a7303(c)(1) (1974); H.\u00a0R. 16373, 93d Cong., 2d Sess.,\n\u00a73 (1974).9The majority cites the\nconclusions of the Privacy Protection Study Commission in support\nof its interpretation of \u201cactual damages.\u201d The majority rightfully\ndoes not claim this piece of postenactment, extratextual material\nis due any deference; nor do I find its unelaborated conclusions\npersuasive.",
