I write\nseparately to emphasize three points.First, the Court\u2019s interpretation of the Clean\nWater Act regarding pollution \u201cfrom\u201d point sources adheres to the\ninterpretation set forth in Justice Scalia\u2019s plurality opinion in\nRapanos v. United States,547 U.S.\n715(2006). The Clean Water Act requires a permit for \u201cany\naddition of any pollutant to navigable waters from any point\nsource.\u201d 33 U. S. C. \u00a71362(12)(A); see \u00a7\u00a71311(a), 1342(a). The key\nword is \u201cfrom.\u201d The question in this case is whether the County of\nMaui needs a permit for its Lahaina Wastewater Reclamation\nFacility. No one disputes that pollutants originated at Maui\u2019s\nwastewater facility (a point source), and no one disputes that the\npollutants ended up in the Pacific Ocean (a navigable water). Maui\ncontends, however, that it does not need a permit. Maui says that\nthe pollutants did not come \u201cfrom\u201d the Lahaina facility because the\npollutants traveled through groundwater before reaching the\nocean.Justice Scalia\u2019s plurality opinion in Rapanos\nexplained why Maui\u2019s interpretation of the Clean Water Act is\nincorrect. In that case, Justice Scalia stated that polluters could\nnot \u201cevade the permitting requirement of \u00a71342(a) simply by\ndischarging their pollutants into noncovered intermittent\nwatercourses that lie upstream of covered waters.\u201d 547 U. S., at\n742\u2013743. Justice Scalia reasoned that the Clean Water Act does not\nmerely \u201cforbid the \u2018addition of any pollutant directly to navigable\nwaters from any point source,\u2019 but rather the \u2018addition of any\npollutant to navigable waters.\u2019 Thus, from the time of the CWA\u2019s\nenactment, lower courts have held that the discharge into\nintermittent channels of any pollutant that naturally washes\ndownstream likely violates \u00a71311(a), even if the pollutants\ndischarged from a point source do not emit \u2018directly into\u2019 covered\nwaters, but pass \u2018through conveyances\u2019 in between.\u201d Id., at 743\n(citations omitted).In other words, under Justice Scalia\u2019s\ninterpretation in Rapanos, the fact that the pollutants from Maui\u2019s\nwastewater facility reach the ocean via an indirect route does not\nitself exempt Maui\u2019s facility from the Clean Water Act\u2019s permitting\nrequirement for point sources. The Court today adheres to Justice\nScalia\u2019s analysis in Rapanos on that issue.Second, as Justice Scalia\u2019s opinion in Rapanos\npointed out and as the Court\u2019s opinion today explains, the statute\ndoes not establish a bright-line test regarding when a pollutant\nmay be considered to have come \u201cfrom\u201d a point source. The source of\nthe vagueness is Congress\u2019 statutory text, not the Court\u2019s opinion.\nThe Court\u2019s opinion seeks to translate the vague statutory text\ninto more concrete guidance.Third, JUSTICE THOMAS\u2019 dissent states that \u201cthe\nCourt does not commit\u201d to \u201cwhich factors are the most important\u201d in\ndetermining whether pollutants that enter navigable waters come\n\u201cfrom\u201d a point source. Post, at 5. That critique is not accurate,\nas I read the Court\u2019s opinion. The Court identifies relevant\nfactors to consider and emphasizes that \u201c[t]ime and distance are\nobviously important.\u201d Ante, at 15. And the Court expressly adds\nthat \u201c[t]ime and distance will be the most important factors in\nmost cases, but not necessarily every case.\u201d Ante, at 16. Although\nthe statutory text does not supply a bright-line test, the Court\u2019s\nemphasis on time and distance will help guide application of the\nstatutory standard going forward.With those additional comments, I join the\nCourt\u2019s opinion in full.",
