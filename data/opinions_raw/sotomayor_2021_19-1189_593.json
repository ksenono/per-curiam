If the district court concludes that the case\nwas improperly removed, it issues an order remanding the case back\nto state court. For more than a century, the rule has been that\nsuch remand orders are generally not subject to appellate review.\nSeeIn re Pennsylvania Co.,137 U.S.\n451, 453\u2013454 (1890). This rule, codified at 28\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71447(d), \u201creflects Congress\u2019s longstanding\npolicy of not permitting interruption of the litigation of the\nmerits of a removed case by prolonged litigation of questions of\njurisdiction of the district court to which the cause is removed.\u201dPowerex Corp.v.Reliant Energy Services, Inc.,551 U.S.\n224, 238 (2007) (internal quotation marks omitted).Originally, there were no exceptions to\n\u00a71447(d)\u2019s bar on appellate review. See \u00a71447(d) (1946 ed., Supp.\nIII). Then, as part of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Congress\ncreated appellate jurisdiction over \u201c\u00a0\u2018order[s] remanding a\ncase to the State court from which it was removed pursuant to\nsection 1443,\u2019\u00a0\u201d the civil rights removal statute. \u00a7901,\n78Stat. 266, 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71447(d) (1964 ed.). In 2011,\nCongress extended this exception to cases removed pursuant to\n\u00a71442, the federal officer removal statute. See \u00a71447(d) (2012\ned.).The Court today holds that a defendant who\ninvokes either \u00a71442 or \u00a71443 when removing a case to federal court\nis entitled to appellate review of not just those grounds, but also\nany other grounds for removal the defendant asserts. I disagree.\nThat interpretation lets defendants sidestep \u00a71447(d)\u2019s bar on\nappellate review by shoehorning a \u00a71442 or \u00a71443 argument into\ntheir case for removal. In other words, it lets the exception\nswallow the rule. Furthermore, when Congress amended \u00a71447(d) to\npermit appellate review of decisions under \u00a71442, every Court of\nAppeals to have addressed the question interpreted \u00a71447(d) to\npermit appellate review of arguments under \u00a71443 only, not of other\narguments for removal addressed in the same order. If Congress\nwanted to disturb that consensus, it would have said so. I\nrespectfully dissent.ISection 1447(d) permits appellate review of\n\u201can order remanding a case to the State court from which it was\nremoved pursuant to section 1442 or 1443.\u201d Everyone agrees how this\nprovision operates in two scenarios. First, if a defendant removes\na suit to federal court without invoking either \u00a71442 or \u00a71443,\nappellate courts may not review the district court\u2019s remand order.\nSecond, if a defendant removes a suit solely under \u00a71442 or \u00a71443,\nappellate review is available for the remand order addressing that\nsingle ground for removal.But what if a defendant removes a case to\nfederal court on multiple grounds, only one of which is \u00a71442 or\n\u00a71443? Section 1447(d) does not speak clearly to that scenario. In\nsome statutes, Congress takes care to specify when it means \u201cthis\nand only this ground.\u201d See,e.g.,\u00a71446(b)(2)(A) (addressing\ncivil actions \u201cremoved solely under section 1441(a)\u201d). Other times,\nCongress makes clear that reliance on a certain ground even \u201cin\npart\u201d will suffice. See,e.g.,\u00a71295(a)(2) (providing for\njurisdiction in the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit over\ncertain district court decisions \u201cif the jurisdiction of that court\nwas based, in whole or in part, on section 1346 of this title\u201d).\nSection 1447(d) contains neither kind of clarifying language,\nleaving uncertain how the provision applies to cases that are not\nremoved under \u00a71442 or \u00a71443 alone. SeeBoard of Cty. Comm\u2019rs of\nBoulder Cty. v.Suncor Energy (U.\u00a0S.\u00a0A.) Inc.,\n965 F.3d 792, 805 (CA10 2020) (Section 1447(d) \u201cdoes not expressly\ncontemplate the situation in which removal is done pursuant to one\nof these sectionsandother grounds\u201d (internal quotation\nmarks omitted)).There are three possible ways forward. The first\npossibility is that \u00a71447(d) permits appellate review of any\nasserted basis for removal so long as the suit was removed in part\npursuant to \u00a71442 or \u00a71443. That is the interpretation urged by\npetitioners and adopted by the Court today. Seeante,at\n5\u20136. The problem with this interpretation is that it stretches the\nexception in \u00a71447(d) too far. It allows defendants to bootstrap\ntheir entire case for removal into the court of appeals simply by\ntacking on an argument under \u00a71442 or \u00a71443. Indeed, under this\ninterpretation, a defendant could formally abandon its argument\nunder \u00a71442 or \u00a71443 and seek an appeal exclusively of other\ngrounds for removal. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 34\u201336, 40\u201341. That\nbizarre outcome, inexplicable in light of the manifest objective of\nlimiting the exceptions in \u00a71447(d), cautions heavily against this\ninterpretation.Another possibility is that a suit removed\npursuant to multiple grounds is not a suit removed pursuant to\n\u00a71442 or \u00a71443 at all, meaning no appellate review whatsoever is\navailable under \u00a71447(d). For good reason, no one advocates this\ninterpretation. Such a rule would certainly avoid prolonged\ndisputes about whether a case belongs in state or federal court,\nbut only by denying appellate review for claims of jurisdiction\nunder the federal-officer and civil-rights removal statutes. That\nresult is hard to square with Congress\u2019 express directive that such\nclaims get a second look.The third possibility is that \u00a71447(d) allows\nappellate review of a defendant\u2019s assertion of removal jurisdiction\nunder the federal-officer or civil-rights removal statute alone.\nAny other grounds for removal would remain subject to \u00a71447(d)\u2019s\nbar on appellate review. This interpretation best accords with\n\u201cCongress\u2019s longstanding policy of not permitting interruption of\nthe litigation of the merits of a removed case\u201d with lengthy\njurisdictional disputes,Powerex Corp., 551 U.\u00a0S., at\n238 (internal quotation marks omitted), while still allowing review\nof the two grounds Congress carved out for special treatment. It\nalso follows this Court\u2019s usual policy of construing both statutory\nexceptions and procedures for removal narrowly. SeeMaracichv.Spears,570 U.S.\n48, 60 (2013) (Statutory exceptions are to be \u201cnarrowly\n[construed] in order to preserve the primary operation of the\nprovision\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted));Syngenta Crop\nProtection, Inc.v.Henson,537 U.S.\n28, 32 (2002) (\u201c[S]tatutory procedures for removal are to be\nstrictly construed\u201d out of respect for state sovereignty).Over the course of several decades, eight Courts\nof Appeals (every one to consider the question) adopted this third\nview of \u00a71447(d).[1]* See,e.g.,Patelv.Del Taco,Inc.,446 F.3d 996, 998 (CA9 2006);Alabamav.Conley,245 F.3d 1292, 1293, n. 1 (CA11 2001) (per\u00a0curiam);Thorntonv.Holloway,70 F.3d 522,524(CA8 1995);State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co. v.Baasch, 644 F.2d 94, 96\u201397 (CA2 1981)\n(per\u00a0curiam);Detroit Police Lieutenants and\nSergeants Assn.v.Detroit, 597 F.2d 566, 567\u2013568 (CA6\n1979) (per\u00a0curiam);Noelv.McCain, 538\nF.2d 633, 635 (CA4 1976);Robertsonv.Ball, 534 F.2d\n63, 65\u201366 (CA5 1976) (per\u00a0curiam);Pennsylvania ex\nrel. Gittmanv.Gittman, 451 F.2d 155, 156\u2013157 (CA3\n1971) (per\u00a0curiam).Congress legislated against the backdrop of this\nconsensus when, in 2011, it amended \u00a71447(d) to extend its\nappellate-review exception, which previously applied to \u00a71443\nalone, to cover \u00a71442 as well. Critically, Congress did not amend\nthe remainder of the provision. Instead, it simply added the words\n\u201c1442 or.\u201d See Removal Clarification Act, 125Stat. 546. Had\nCongress disagreed with the settled interpretation of \u00a71447(d), it\npresumably would have done something about it.The Court dismisses the possibility of\ncongressional ratification by characterizing an unbroken line of\ndecisions from two-thirds of the Courts of Appeals spanning nearly\nhalf a century as \u201ca smattering of lower court opinions.\u201dAnte,at 11. I would not assume that so many decisions\nreaching the same conclusion over such a long period were beneath\nCongress\u2019 notice. \u201c\u00a0\u2018If a word or phrase has been given a\nuniform interpretation by inferior courts, a later version of that\nact perpetuating the wording is presumed to carry forward that\ninterpretation.\u2019\u00a0\u201dTexas Dept. of Housing and Community\nAffairsv.Inclusive Communities Project, Inc., 576 U.S.\n519, 536 (2015) (quoting A. Scalia & B. Garner, Reading Law:\nThe Interpretation of Legal Texts 322 (2012); ellipses omitted).\nThat Congress did not disturb the prevailing interpretation of\n\u00a71447(d) is a compelling reason this Court should not either.IIThe Court sees things differently. In its\nview, it \u201cdoes [not] matter\u201d whether \u201ca defendant removes a case\n\u2018pursuant to\u2019 multiple federal statutes\u201d or just one.Ante,\nat 5. Either way, \u00a71447(d) grants the court of appeals jurisdiction\nover the \u201corder\u201d remanding the case back to state court. According\nto the Court, once the court of appeals takes jurisdiction over an\norder, it necessarily takes jurisdiction over all grounds for\nremoval encompassed within it.In support of this theory, the Court looks toYamaha Motor Corp., U.\u00a0S.\u00a0A.v.Calhoun,516 U.S.\n199(1996). That case concerned 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71292(b),\na distinct statute that permits appellate review of an\ninterlocutory \u201corder not otherwise appealable\u201d if the district\ncourt certifies that the order \u201cinvolves a controlling question of\nlaw as to which there is substantial ground for difference of\nopinion.\u201d \u00a71292(b). Looking to \u201cthe text of \u00a71292(b),\u201d theYamahaCourt determined that, having taken jurisdiction over\na \u00a71292(b) order, a court of appeals may reach any issue fairly\nencompassed within it. 516 U.\u00a0S., at 205. In the Court\u2019s view\ntoday,Yamahameans that appellate review of a remand order\nunder \u00a71447(d) must likewise be plenary.Yamahadoes not do the work the Court\nsays it does. Section 1292(b) provides that an interlocutory order\nis appealable if it merely \u201cinvolves\u201d a certified issue. There was\nthus no question inYamahathat \u00a71292(b) accounts for\ncertified orders that address multiple issues, some of which are\nnot \u201ccontrolling question[s] of law as to which there is\nsubstantial ground for difference of opinion.\u201d \u00a71292(b). Section\n1447(d) lacks comparable language about what happens when a party\nremoves a case on multiple grounds. That is precisely what makes it\nambiguous.The Court is left with the premise that\nappellate jurisdiction over an order (as with a judgment, decree,\nor sentence) usually means jurisdiction over all legal issues\naddressed within it.Ante,at 5\u20136. I agree that this premise\nwill often hold true. But not always, as the Court itself\nrecognizes. Seeante,at 9\u201310 (discussingMurdockv.Memphis, 20 Wall. 590 (1875), andUnited Statesv.Keitel,211 U.S.\n370(1908)). Context matters. To recap, in 1964, Congress\ncreated a limited exception for claims of removal under \u00a71443 to\nwhat had long been an absolute prohibition on appellate review of\nremand orders. After nearly half a century of courts interpreting\nthat exception narrowly, Congress extended the exception to \u00a71442\nwithout otherwise amending \u00a71447(d). Section 1447(d) only\nunambiguously permits appellate review over remand orders that are\nbased solely on one of those two grounds. Granting defendants\nappellate review of other grounds of removal whenever they tack on\nan argument under \u00a71442 or \u00a71443 would allow the exception to trump\nthe rule. In these circumstances, the Court should seek an\ninterpretation of \u00a71447(d) that not only respects its carveout for\narguments under \u00a71442 and \u00a71443 but also preserves its general bar\non appellate review.IIIUnfortunately, I fear today\u2019s decision will\nreward defendants for raising strained theories of removal under\n\u00a71442 or \u00a71443 by allowing them to circumvent the bar on appellate\nreview entirely. Look no further than this case. In 2018, the Mayor\nand City Council of Baltimore sued petitioners for allegedly\nconcealing the connection between fossil fuels and climate change.\nPetitioners listed eight grounds for removal to federal court,\nincluding \u00a71442. But petitioners now ask only for a ruling that\nremoval was proper under \u00a71441(a) (i.e.,federal-question\njurisdiction). Had petitioners relied solely on \u00a71441(a) before the\nDistrict Court, as they do now, no one disputes their argument\nwould be unreviewable on appeal.Not to worry, petitioners assure us: The threat\nof sanctions will sufficiently deter gamesmanship. While sanctions\nhelp ward off egregious misconduct, they are no failsafe. See,e.g.,Martinv.Franklin Capital Corp.,546 U.S.\n132, 141 (2005) (\u201cAbsent unusual circumstances, courts may\naward attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a71447(c) only where the removing party\nlacked an objectively reasonable basis for seeking removal\u201d). A\nfederal-officer claim can be so weak it is not worth pursuing on\nappeal, but not so meritless as to warrant sanctions. Again, look\nto this case. Petitioners no longer advance their argument under\n\u00a71442, calling it only \u201csubstantial.\u201d Brief for Petitioners 35. Yet\nthat argument somehow opens a back door to appellate review that\nwould otherwise be closed to them. Meanwhile, Baltimore, which has\nalready waited nearly three years to begin litigation on the\nmerits, is consigned to waiting once more.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*Section 1447(d) places \u201cbroad restrictions on\nthe power of federal appellate courts to review district court\norders remanding removed cases to state court.\u201dThings\nRemembered, Inc.v.Petrarca,516\nU.S. 124, 127 (1995). After today\u2019s decision, defendants can\nsidestep these restrictions by making near-frivolous arguments for\nremoval under \u00a71442 or \u00a71443. Congress, of course, can amend\n\u00a71447(d) to make even clearer that appellate review of a district\ncourt remand order extends to only \u00a71442 or \u00a71443. Because I\nbelieve \u00a71447 already bears that meaning, I respectfully\ndissent.Notes1*The Tenth Circuit had also\nreached this conclusion prior to Congress amending \u00a71447(d), albeit\nin an unpublished opinion. SeeSanchezv.Onuska, 2\nF.3d 1160 (Table), 1993 WL 307897, *1 (1993)\n(per\u00a0curiam). The Tenth Circuit has since reaffirmed\nthat holding in a published opinion. SeeBoard of Cty. Comm\u2019rs\nof Boulder Cty. v.Suncor Energy (U.\u00a0S.\u00a0A.)\nInc., 965 F.3d 792, 802, n. 6 (2020).",
