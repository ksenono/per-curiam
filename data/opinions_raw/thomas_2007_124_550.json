S. 833(1992). I write separately to reiterate my view that the Court\u2019s\nabortion jurisprudence, includingCaseyandRoev.Wade,410 U. S. 113(1973),\nhas no basis in the Constitution. SeeCasey,supra, at 979 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment in part\nand dissenting in part);Stenbergv.Carhart,530 U. S. 914,\n980\u2013983 (2000) (Thomas, J., dissenting). I also note that whether\nthe Act constitutes a permissible exercise of Congress\u2019 power under\nthe Commerce Clause is not before the Court. The parties did not\nraise or brief that issue; it is outside the question presented;\nand the lower courts did not address it. SeeCutterv.Wilkinson,544 U. S. 709, 727,\nn.\u00a02 (2005) (Thomas, J., concurring).",
