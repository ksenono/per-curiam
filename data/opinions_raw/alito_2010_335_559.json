P.on writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the seventh circuit[March 30, 2010]Justice Alito delivered the\nopinion of the Court.We consider in this case what a\nmutual fund shareholder must prove in order to show that a mutual\nfund investment adviser breached the \u201cfiduciary duty with respect\nto the receipt of compensation for services\u201d that is imposed by\n\u00a736(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, 15 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a780a\u201335(b) (hereinafter \u00a736(b)).IAThe Investment Company Act of\n1940 (Act), 54 Stat. 789, 15 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a780a\u20131et seq.,\nregulates investment companies, including mutual funds. \u201cA mutual\nfund is a pool of assets, consisting primarily of [a] portfolio\n[of] securities, and belonging to the individual investors holding\nshares in the fund.\u201dBurksv.Lasker, 441 U.\u2002S.\n471, 480 (1979). The following arrangements are typical. A separate\nentity called an investment adviser creates the mutual fund, which\nmay have no employees of its own. SeeKamenv.Kemper\nFinancial Services, Inc.,500 U. S. 90, 93 (1991);Daily Income Fund, Inc.v.Fox,464 U. S. 523, 536\n(1984);Burks, 441 U. S., at 480\u2013481. The adviser selects\nthe fund\u2019s directors, manages the fund\u2019s investments, and provides\nother services. Seeid.,at 481. Because of the\nrelationship between a mutual fund and its investment adviser, the\nfund often \u201c\u00a0\u2018cannot, as a practical matter sever its\nrelationship with the adviser. Therefore, the forces of\narm\u2019s-length bargaining do not work in the mutual fund industry in\nthe same manner as they do in other sectors of the American\neconomy.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIbid.(quoting S.\u00a0Rep. No. 91\u2013184,\np.\u00a05 (1969) (hereinafter S.\u00a0Rep.)).\u201cCongress adopted the [Investment\nCompany Act of 1940] because of its concern with the potential for\nabuse inherent in the structure of investment companies.\u201dDaily\nIncome Fund,464 U. S., at 536 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Recognizing that the relationship between a fund and its\ninvestment adviser was \u201cfraught with potential conflicts of\ninterest,\u201d the Act created protections for mutual fund\nshareholders.Id.,at 536\u2013538 (internal quotation marks\nomitted);Burks, supra,at 482\u2013483. Among other things,\nthe Act required that no more than 60 percent of a fund\u2019s directors\ncould be affiliated with the adviser and that fees for investment\nadvisers be approved by the directors and the shareholders of the\nfund. See \u00a7\u00a710, 15(c), 54 Stat. 806, 813.The growth of mutual funds in the 1950\u2019s and\n1960\u2019s prompted studies of the 1940 Act\u2019s effectiveness in\nprotecting investors. SeeDaily Income Fund, 464 U. S., at\n537\u2013538. Studies commissioned or authored by the Securities and\nExchange Commission (SEC or Commission) identified problems\nrelating to the independence of investment company boards and the\ncompensation received by investment advisers. Seeibid. In\nresponse to such concerns, Congress amended the Act in 1970 and\nbolstered shareholder protection in two primary ways.First, the amendments strengthened the\n\u201ccornerstone\u201d of the Act\u2019s efforts to check conflicts of interest,\nthe independence of mutual fund boards of directors, which\nnegotiate and scrutinize adviser compensation.Burks,\nsupra,at 482. The amendments required that no more than 60\npercent of a fund\u2019s directors be \u201cpersons who are interested\npersons,\u201de.g.,that they have no interest in or\naffiliation with the investment adviser.[Footnote 1] 15 U.\u2002S.\u2002C. \u00a780a\u201310(a); \u00a780a\u20132(a)(19); see\nalsoDaily Income Fund,supra, at 538. These\nboard members are given \u201ca host of special responsibilities.\u201dBurks, 441 U.\u2002S., at 482\u2013483. In particular, they must\n\u201creview and approve the contracts of the investment adviser\u201d\nannually,id.,at 483, and a majority of these directors\nmust approve an adviser\u2019s compensation, 15 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a780a\u201315(c). Second, \u00a736(b), 84 Stat. 1429, of the Act imposed upon\ninvestment advisers a \u201cfiduciary duty\u201d with respect to compensation\nreceived from a mutual fund, 15 U.\u2002S.\u2002C. \u00a780a\u201335(b), and granted\nindividual investors a private right of action for breach of that\nduty,ibid.The \u201cfiduciary duty\u201d standard contained in\n\u00a736(b) represented a delicate compromise. Prior to the adoption of\nthe 1970 amendments, shareholders challenging investment adviser\nfees under state law were required to meet \u201ccommon-law standards of\ncorporate waste, under which an unreasonable or unfair fee might be\napproved unless the court deemed it \u2018unconscionable\u2019 or\n\u2018shocking,\u2019\u00a0\u201d and \u201csecurity holders challenging adviser fees\nunder the [Investment Company Act] itself had been required to\nprove gross abuse of trust.\u201dDaily Income Fund, 464 U. S.,\nat 540, n.\u00a012. Aiming to give shareholders a stronger remedy,\nthe SEC proposed a provision that would have empowered the\nCommission to bring actions to challenge a fee that was not\n\u201creasonable\u201d and to intervene in any similar action brought by or\non behalf of an investment company.Id.,at 538. This\napproach was included in a bill that passed the House. H.\u2002R. 9510,\n90th Cong., 1st Sess., \u00a78(d) (1967); see also S. 1659, 90th Cong.,\n1st Sess., \u00a78(d) (1967). Industry representatives, however,\nobjected to this proposal, fearing that it \u201cmight in essence\nprovide the Commission with ratemaking authority.\u201dDaily Income\nFund, 464 U. S., at 538.The provision that was ultimately enacted\nadopted \u201ca different method of testing management compensation,\u201did.,at 539 (quoting S.\u2002Rep., at 5 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted)), that was more favorable to shareholders than the\npreviously available remedies but that did not permit a\ncompensation agreement to be reviewed in court for\n\u201creasonableness.\u201d This is the fiduciary duty standard in\n\u00a736(b).BPetitioners are shareholders in\nthree different mutual funds managed by respondent Harris\nAssociates L. P., an investment adviser. Petitioners filed this\naction in the Northern District of Illinois pursuant to \u00a736(b)\nseeking damages, an injunction, and rescission of advisory\nagreements between Harris Associates and the mutual funds. The\ncomplaint alleged that Harris Associates had violated \u00a736(b) by\ncharging fees that were \u201cdisproportionate to the services rendered\u201d\nand \u201cnot within the range of what would have been negotiated at\narm\u2019s length in light of all the surrounding circumstances.\u201d App.\n52.The District Court granted\nsummary judgment for Harris Associates. Applying the standard\nadopted inGartenbergv.Merrill Lynch Asset\nManagement, Inc., 694 F.\u00a02d 923 (CA2 1982), the court\nconcluded that petitioners had failed to raise a triable issue of\nfact as to \u201cwhether the fees charged \u2026 were so disproportionately\nlarge that they could not have been the result of arm\u2019s-length\nbargaining.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 29a. The District Court assumed\nthat it was relevant to compare the challenged fees with those that\nHarris Associates charged its other clients.Id.,at 30a.\nBut in light of those comparisons as well as comparisons with fees\ncharged by other investment advisers to similar mutual funds, the\nCourt held that it could not reasonably be found that the\nchallenged fees were outside the range that could have been the\nproduct of arm\u2019s-length bargaining.Id.,at 29a\u201332a.A panel of the Seventh Circuit affirmed based\non different reasoning, explicitly \u201cdisapprov[ing] theGartenbergapproach.\u201d 527 F.\u00a03d 627, 632 (2008).\nLooking to trust law, the panel noted that, while a trustee \u201cowes\nan obligation of candor in negotiation,\u201d a trustee, at the time of\nthe creation of a trust, \u201cmay negotiate in his own interest and\naccept what the settlor or governance institution agrees to pay.\u201dIbid.(citing Restatement (Second) of Trusts \u00a7242, and\nCommentf)). The panel thus reasoned that \u201c[a] fiduciary\nduty differs from rate regulation. A fiduciary must make full\ndisclosure and play no tricks but is not subject to a cap on\ncompensation.\u201d 527 F.\u00a03d, at 632. In the panel\u2019s view, the\namount of an adviser\u2019s compensation would be relevant only if the\ncompensation were \u201cso unusual\u201d as to give rise to an inference\n\u201cthat deceit must have occurred, or that the persons responsible\nfor decision have abdicated.\u201dIbid.The panel argued that this understanding of\n\u00a736(b) is consistent with the forces operating in the contemporary\nmutual fund market. Noting that \u201c[t]oday thousands of mutual funds\ncompete,\u201d the panel concluded that \u201csophisticated investors\u201d shop\nfor the funds that produce the best overall results, \u201cmov[e] their\nmoney elsewhere\u201d when fees are \u201cexcessive in relation to the\nresults,\u201d and thus \u201ccreate a competitive pressure\u201d that generally\nkeeps fees low.Id.,at 633\u2013634. The panel faultedGartenbergon the ground that it \u201crelies too little on\nmarkets.\u201d 527 F.\u00a03d, at 632. And the panel firmly rejected a\ncomparison between the fees that Harris Associates charged to the\nfunds and the fees that Harris Associates charged other types of\nclients, observing that \u201c[d]ifferent clients call for different\ncommitments of time\u201d and that costs, such as research, that may\nbenefit several categories of clients \u201cmake it hard to draw\ninferences from fee levels.\u201dId.,at 634.The Seventh Circuit denied rehearing en banc\nby an equally divided vote. 537 F.\u00a03d 728 (2008). The dissent\nfrom the denial of rehearing argued that the panel\u2019s rejection ofGartenbergwas based \u201cmainly on an economic analysis that\nis ripe for reexamination.\u201d 537 F.\u20023d, at 730 (opinion of Posner,\nJ.). Among other things, the dissent expressed concern that Harris\nAssociates charged \u201cits captive funds more than twice what it\ncharges independent funds,\u201d and the dissent questioned whether high\nadviser fees actually drive investors away.Id.,at\n731.We granted certiorari to resolve a split among\nthe Courts of Appeals over the proper standard under\n\u00a736(b).[Footnote 2] 556 U. S.\n___ (2009).IIASince Congress amended the\nInvestment Company Act in 1970, the mutual fund industry has\nexperienced exponential growth. Assets under management increased\nfrom $38.2 billion in 1966 to over $9.6 trillion in 2008. The\nnumber of mutual fund investors grew from 3.5 million in 1965 to 92\nmillion in 2008, and there are now more than 9,000 open- and\nclosed-end funds.[Footnote\n3]During this time, the standard\nfor an investment adviser\u2019s fiduciary duty has remained an open\nquestion in our Court, but, until the Seventh Circuit\u2019s decision\nbelow, something of a consensus had developed regarding the\nstandard set forth over 25 years ago inGartenberg, supra.TheGartenbergstandard has been adopted by other federal\ncourts,[Footnote 4] and \u201c[t]he\nSEC\u2019s regulations have recognized, and formalized,Gartenberg-like factors.\u201d Brief for United States asAmicus Curiae23. See 17 CFR \u00a7240.14a\u2013101, Sched. 14A,\nItem 22, para. (c)(11)(i) (2009); 69 Fed. Reg. 39801, n.\u200231,\n39807\u201339809 (2004). In the present case, both petitioners and\nrespondent generally endorse theGartenbergapproach,\nalthough they disagree in some respects about its meaning.InGartenberg, the Second Circuit\nnoted that Congress had not defined what it meant by a \u201cfiduciary\nduty\u201d with respect to compensation but concluded that \u201cthe test is\nessentially whether the fee schedule represents a charge within the\nrange of what would have been negotiated at arm\u2019s-length in the\nlight of all of the surrounding circumstances.\u201d 694 F.\u20022d, at 928.\nThe Second Circuit elaborated that, \u201c[t]o be guilty of a violation\nof \u00a736(b), \u2026 the adviser-manager must charge a fee that is so\ndisproportionately large that it bears no reasonable relationship\nto the services rendered and could not have been the product of\narm\u2019s-length bargaining.\u201dIbid. \u201cTo make this\ndetermination,\u201d the Court stated, \u201call pertinent facts must be\nweighed,\u201did.,at 929, and the Court specifically\nmentioned \u201cthe adviser-manager\u2019s cost in providing the service, \u2026\nthe extent to which the adviser-manager realizes economies of scale\nas the fund grows larger, and the volume of orders which must be\nprocessed by the manager.\u201dId.,at 930.[Footnote 5] Observing that competition among\nadvisers for the business of managing a fund may be \u201cvirtually\nnon-existent,\u201d the Court rejected the suggestion that \u201cthe\nprincipal factor to be considered in evaluating a fee\u2019s fairness is\nthe price charged by other similar advisers to funds managed by\nthem,\u201d although the Court did not suggest that this factor could\nnot be \u201ctaken into account.\u201dId.,at 929. The Court\nlikewise rejected the \u201cargument that the lower fees charged by\ninvestment advisers to large pension funds should be used as a\ncriterion for determining fair advisory fees for money market\nfunds,\u201d since a \u201cpension fund does not face the myriad of daily\npurchases and redemptions throughout the nation which must be\nhandled by [a money market fund].\u201dId.,at 930,\nn.\u00a03.[Footnote 6]BThe meaning of \u00a736(b)\u2019s reference\nto \u201ca fiduciary duty with respect to the receipt of compensation\nfor services\u201d[Footnote 7] is\nhardly pellucid, but based on the terms of that provision and the\nrole that a shareholder action for breach of that duty plays in the\noverall structure of the Act, we conclude thatGartenbergwas correct in its basic formulation of what \u00a736(b) requires: to\nface liability under \u00a736(b), an investment adviser must charge a\nfee that is so disproportionately large that it bears no reasonable\nrelationship to the services rendered and could not have been the\nproduct of arm\u2019s length bargaining.1We begin with the language of\n\u00a736(b). As noted, the Seventh Circuit panel thought that the phrase\n\u201cfiduciary duty\u201d incorporates a standard taken from the law of\ntrusts. Petitioners agree but maintain that the panel identified\nthe wrong trust-law standard. Instead of the standard that applies\nwhen a trustee and a settlor negotiate the trustee\u2019s fee at the\ntime of the creation of a trust, petitioners invoke the standard\nthat applies when a trustee seeks compensation after the trust is\ncreated. Brief for Petitioners 20\u201323, 35\u201337. A compensation\nagreement reached at that time, they point out, \u201c\u00a0\u2018will not\nbind the beneficiary\u2019 if either \u2018the trustee failed to make a full\ndisclosure of all circumstances affecting the agreement\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nwhich he knew or should have known or if the agreement is unfair to\nthe beneficiary.Id.,at 23 (quoting Restatement (Second)\nof Trusts \u00a7242, Commenti). Respondent, on the other hand,\ncontends that the term \u201cfiduciary\u201d is not exclusive to the law of\ntrusts, that the phrase means different things in different\ncontexts, and that there is no reason to believe that \u00a736(b)\nincorporates the specific meaning of the term in the law of trusts.\nBrief for Respondent 34\u201336.We find it unnecessary to take\nsides in this dispute. InPepperv.Litton, 308\nU.\u2002S. 295 (1939), we discussed the meaning of the concept of\nfiduciary duty in a context that is analogous to that presented\nhere, and we also looked to trust law. At issue inPepperwas whether a bankruptcy court could disallow a dominant or\ncontrolling shareholder\u2019s claim for compensation against a bankrupt\ncorporation. Dominant or controlling shareholders, we held, are\n\u201cfiduciar[ies]\u201d whose \u201cpowers are powers [held] in trust.\u201dId.,at 306. We then explained:\u201cTheir dealings with the corporation are subjected\nto rigorous scrutiny and where any of their contracts or\nengagements with the corporation is challenged the burden is on the\ndirector or stockholder not only to prove the good faith of the\ntransaction but also to show its inherent fairness from the\nviewpoint of the corporation and those interested therein\u2026\u00a0.The essence of the test is whether or not under all the\ncircumstances the transaction carries the earmarks of an arm\u2019s\nlength bargain.If it does not, equity will set it aside.\u201dId.,at 306\u2013307 (emphasis added; footnote omitted); see\nalsoGeddesv.Anaconda Copper Mining Co.,254 U. S. 590,\n599 (1921) (standard of fiduciary duty for interested\ndirectors).We believe that this formulation expresses the\nmeaning of the phrase \u201cfiduciary duty\u201d in \u00a736(b), 84 Stat. 1429.\nThe Investment Company Act modifies this duty in a significant way:\nit shifts the burden of proof from the fiduciary to the party\nclaiming breach, 15 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a780a\u201335(b)(1), to show that the\nfee is outside the range that arm\u2019s-length bargaining would\nproduce.TheGartenbergapproach fully\nincorporates this understanding of the fiduciary duty as set out inPepperand reflects \u00a736(b)(1)\u2019s imposition of the burden\non the plaintiff. As noted,Gartenberginsists that all\nrelevant circumstances be taken into account, see 694 F.\u00a02d,\nat 929, as does \u00a736(b)(2), 84 Stat. 1429 (\u201c[A]pproval by the board\nof directors \u2026 shall be given such consideration by the court as is\ndeemed appropriate underall the circumstances\u201d\n(emphasis added)). AndGartenberguses the range of fees\nthat might result from arm\u2019s-length bargaining as the benchmark for\nreviewing challenged fees.2Gartenberg\u2019s approach\nalso reflects \u00a736(b)\u2019s place in the statutory scheme and, in\nparticular, its relationship to the other protections that the Act\naffords investors.Under the Act, scrutiny of\ninvestment adviser compensation by a fully informed mutual fund\nboard is the \u201ccornerstone of the \u2026 effort to control conflicts of\ninterest within mutual funds.\u201dBurks, 441 U. S., at 482.\nThe Act interposes disinterested directors as \u201cindependent\nwatchdogs\u201d of the relationship between a mutual fund and its\nadviser.Id.,at 484 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nTo provide these directors with the information needed to judge\nwhether an adviser\u2019s compensation is excessive, the Act requires\nadvisers to furnish all information \u201creasonably \u2026 necessary to\nevaluate the terms\u201d of the adviser\u2019s contract, 15 U.\u2002S.\u2002C.\n\u00a780a\u201315(c), and gives the SEC the authority to enforce that\nrequirement. See \u00a780a\u201341. Board scrutiny of adviser compensation\nand shareholder suits under \u00a736(b), 84 Stat. 1429, are mutually\nreinforcing but independent mechanisms for controlling conflicts.\nSeeDaily Income Fund, 464 U. S., at 541 (Congress\nintended for \u00a736(b) suits and directorial approval of adviser\ncontracts to act as \u201cindependent checks on excessive fees\u201d);Kamen, 500 U. S., at 108 (\u201cCongress added \u00a736(b) to the\n[Act] in 1970 because it concluded that the shareholders should not\nhave to rely solely on the fund\u2019s directors to assure reasonable\nadviser fees, notwithstanding the increased disinterestedness of\nthe board\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).In recognition of the role of the\ndisinterested directors, the Act instructs courts to give board\napproval of an adviser\u2019s compensation \u201csuch consideration \u2026 as is\ndeemed appropriate under all the circumstances.\u201d \u00a780a\u201335(b)(2). Cf.Burks,441 U. S., at 485 (\u201c[I]t would have been\nparadoxical for Congress to have been willing to rely largely upon\n[boards of directors as] \u2018watchdogs\u2019 to protect shareholder\ninterests and yet, where the \u2018watchdogs\u2019 have done precisely that,\nrequire that they be totally muzzled\u201d).From this formulation, two inferences may be\ndrawn. First, a measure of deference to a board\u2019s judgment may be\nappropriate in some instances. Second, the appropriate measure of\ndeference varies depending on the circumstances.Gartenbergheeds these precepts.Gartenbergadvises that \u201cthe expertise of the independent\ntrustees of a fund, whether they are fully informed about all facts\nbearing on the [investment adviser\u2019s] service and fee, and the\nextent of care and conscientiousness with which they perform their\nduties are important factors to be considered in deciding whether\nthey and the [investment adviser] are guilty of a breach of\nfiduciary duty in violation of \u00a736(b).\u201d 694 F.\u20022d, at 930.IIIWhile both parties in this case\nendorse the basicGartenbergapproach, they disagree on\nseveral important questions that warrant discussion.The first concerns comparisons\nbetween the fees that an adviser charges a captive mutual fund and\nthe fees that it charges its independent clients. As noted, theGartenbergcourt rejected a comparison between the fees\nthat the adviser in that case charged a money market fund and the\nfees that it charged a pension fund. 694 F.\u00a02d, at 930,\nn.\u00a03 (noting the \u201c[t]he nature and extent of the services\nrequired by each type of fund differ sharply\u201d). Petitioners contend\nthat such a comparison is appropriate, Brief for Petitioners 30\u201331,\nbut respondent disagrees. Brief for Respondent 38\u201344. Since the Act\nrequires consideration of all relevant factors, 15 U.\u2002S.\u2002C.\n\u00a780a\u201335(b)(2); see also \u00a780a\u201315(c), we do not think that there can\nbe any categorical rule regarding the comparisons of the fees\ncharged different types of clients. SeeDaily Income Fund,\nsupra, at 537 (discussing concern with investment advisers\u2019\npractice of charging higher fees to mutual funds than to their\nother clients). Instead, courts may give such comparisons the\nweight that they merit in light of the similarities and differences\nbetween the services that the clients in question require, but\ncourts must be wary of inapt comparisons. As the panel below noted,\nthere may be significant differences between the services provided\nby an investment adviser to a mutual fund and those it provides to\na pension fund which are attributable to the greater frequency of\nshareholder redemptions in a mutual fund, the higher turnover of\nmutual fund assets, the more burdensome regulatory and legal\nobligations, and higher marketing costs. 527 F.\u00a03d, at 634\n(\u201cDifferent clients call for different commitments of time\u201d). If\nthe services rendered are sufficiently different that a comparison\nis not probative, then courts must reject such a comparison. Even\nif the services provided and fees charged to an independent fund\nare relevant, courts should be mindful that the Act does not\nnecessarily ensure fee parity between mutual funds and\ninstitutional clients contrary to petitioners\u2019 contentions. Seeid.,at 631. (\u201cPlaintiffs maintain that a fiduciary may\ncharge its controlled clients no more than its independent\nclients\u201d).[Footnote 8]By the same token, courts should not rely too\nheavily on comparisons with fees charged to mutual funds by other\nadvisers. These comparisons are problematic because these fees,\nlike those challenged, may not be the product of negotiations\nconducted at arm\u2019s length. See 537 F.\u00a03d, at 731\u2013732 (opinion\ndissenting from denial of rehearing en banc);Gartenberg,\nsupra, at 929 (\u201cCompetition between money market funds for\nshareholder business does not support an inference that competition\nmust therefore also exist between [investment advisers] for fund\nbusiness. The former may be vigorous even though the latter is\nvirtually non-existent\u201d).Finally, a court\u2019s evaluation of an investment\nadviser\u2019s fiduciary duty must take into account both procedure and\nsubstance. See 15 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a780a\u201335(b)(2) (requiring deference\nto board\u2019s consideration \u201cas is deemed appropriate under all the\ncircumstances\u201d); cf.Daily Income Fund, 464 U. S., at 541\n(\u201cCongress intended security holder and SEC actions under \u00a736(b),\non the one hand, and directorial approval of adviser contracts, on\nthe other, to act as independent checks on excessive fees\u201d). Where\na board\u2019s process for negotiating and reviewing investment-adviser\ncompensation is robust, a reviewing court should afford\ncommensurate deference to the outcome of the bargaining process.\nSeeBurks,441 U. S., at 484 (unaffiliated directors serve\nas \u201cindependent watchdogs\u201d). Thus, if the disinterested directors\nconsidered the relevant factors, their decision to approve a\nparticular fee agreement is entitled to considerable weight, even\nif a court might weigh the factors differently. Cf. id.,at 485. This is not to deny that a fee may be excessive even if it\nwas negotiated by a board in possession of all relevant\ninformation, but such a determination must be based on evidence\nthat the fee \u201cis so disproportionately large that it bears no\nreasonable relationship to the services rendered and could not have\nbeen the product of arm\u2019s-length bargaining.\u201dGartenberg,supra, at 928.In contrast, where the board\u2019s process was\ndeficient or the adviser withheld important information, the court\nmust take a more rigorous look at the outcome. When an investment\nadviser fails to disclose material information to the board,\ngreater scrutiny is justified because the withheld information\nmight have hampered the board\u2019s ability to function as \u201can\nindependent check upon the management.\u201dBurks,supra, at 484 (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cSection\n36(b) is sharply focused on the question of whether the fees\nthemselves were excessive.\u201dMigdalv.Rowe\nPrice-Fleming Int\u2019l, Inc.,248 F.\u00a03d 321, 328 (CA4 2001);\nsee also 15 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a780a\u201335(b) (imposing a \u201cfiduciary duty\nwith respect to thereceipt of compensationfor\nservices,or of payments of a material nature\u201d\n(emphasis added)). But an adviser\u2019s compliance or noncompliance\nwith its disclosure obligations is a factor that must be considered\nin calibrating the degree of deference that is due a board\u2019s\ndecision to approve an adviser\u2019s fees.It is also important to note that the standard\nfor fiduciary breach under \u00a736(b) does not call for judicial\nsecond-guessing of informed board decisions. SeeDaily Income\nFund,supra, at 538; see alsoBurks, 441 U.\nS., at 483 (\u201cCongress consciously chose to address the\nconflict-of-interest problem through the Act\u2019s\nindependent-directors section, rather than through more drastic\nremedies\u201d). \u201c[P]otential conflicts [of interests] may justify some\nrestraints upon the unfettered discretion of even disinterested\nmutual fund directors, particularly in their transactions with the\ninvestment adviser,\u201d but they do not suggest that a court may\nsupplant the judgment of disinterested directors apprised of all\nrelevant information, without additional evidence that the fee\nexceeds the arm\u2019s-length range.Id., at 481. In reviewing\ncompensation under \u00a736(b), the Act does not require courts to\nengage in a precise calculation of fees representative of\narm\u2019s-length bargaining. See 527 F.\u00a03d, at 633 (\u201cJudicial\nprice-setting does not accompany fiduciary duties\u201d). As recounted\nabove, Congress rejected a \u201creasonableness\u201d requirement that was\ncriticized as charging the courts with rate-setting\nresponsibilities. SeeDaily Income Fund,supra,\nat 538\u2013540. Congress\u2019 approach recognizes that courts are not well\nsuited to make such precise calculations. Cf.General Motors\nCorp.v.Tracy,519 U. S. 278, 308\n(1997) (\u201c[T]he Court is institutionally unsuited to gather the\nfacts upon which economic predictions can be made, and\nprofessionally untrained to make them\u201d);Verizon Communications\nInc.v.FCC, 535 U.\u2002S. 467, 539 (2002); see alsoConcordv.Boston Edison Co., 915 F.\u20022d 17, 25\n(CA1 1990) (opinion for the court by Breyer, C.\u00a0J.) (\u201c[H]ow is\na judge or jury to determine a \u2018fair price\u2019?\u201d).Gartenberg\u2019s \u201cso disproportionately large\u201d standard, 694\nF.\u00a02d, at 928, reflects this congressional choice to \u201crely\nlargely upon [independent director] \u2018watchdogs\u2019 to protect\nshareholders interests.\u201dBurks, supra,at 485.By focusing almost entirely on the element of\ndisclosure, the Seventh Circuit panel erred. See 527 F.\u00a03d, at\n632 (An investment adviser \u201cmust make full disclosure and play no\ntricks but is not subject to a cap on compensation\u201d). TheGartenbergstandard, which the panel rejected, may lack\nsharp analytical clarity, but we believe that it accurately\nreflects the compromise that is embodied in \u00a736(b), and it has\nprovided a workable standard for nearly three decades. The debate\nbetween the Seventh Circuit panel and the dissent from the denial\nof rehearing regarding today\u2019s mutual fund market is a matter for\nCongress, not the courts.IVFor the foregoing reasons, the\njudgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case remanded\nfor further proceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.Footnote 1An \u201caffiliated person\u201d includes (1) a person\nwho owns, controls, or holds the power to vote 5 percent or more of\nthe securities of the investment adviser; (2) an entity which the\ninvestment adviser owns, controls, or in which it holds the power\nto vote more than 5 percent of the securities; (3) any person\ndirectly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common\ncontrol with the investment adviser; (4) an officer, director,\npartner, copartner, or employee of the investment adviser; (5) an\ninvestment adviser or a member of the investment adviser\u2019s board of\ndirectors; or (6) the depositor of an unincorporated investment\nadviser. See \u00a780a\u20132(a)(3). The Act defines \u201cinterested person\u201d to\ninclude not only all affiliated persons but also a wider swath of\npeople such as the immediate family of affiliated persons,\ninterested persons of an underwriter or investment adviser, legal\ncounsel for the company, and interested broker-dealers.\n\u00a780a\u20132(a)(19).Footnote 2See 527 F.\u00a03d 627 (CA7 2008) (case\nbelow);Migdalv.Rowe Price-Fleming Int\u2019l, Inc.,\n248 F.\u00a03d 321 (CA4 2001);Krantzv.Prudential\nInvs. Fund Management LLC, 305 F.\u00a03d 140 (CA3 2002)(per curiam).

A money market fund often invests in short-term money\nmarket securities, such as short-term securities of the United\nStates Government or its agencies, bank certificates of deposit,\nand commercial paper. Investors can invest in such a fund for as\nlittle as a day, so, from the investor\u2019s perspective, the fund\nresembles an investment \u201cmore like a bank account than [a]\ntraditional investment in securities.\u201dId.,at 925.Footnote 7Section 36 (b) provides as follows:\u201c[T]he investment adviser of a registered\ninvestment company shall be deemed to have a fiduciary duty with\nrespect to the receipt of compensation for services, or of payments\nof a material nature, paid by such registered investment company,\nor by the security holders thereof, to such investment adviser.\u201d 84\nStat. 1429 (codified at 15 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a780a\u201335(b)).Footnote 8Comparisons with fees charged to\ninstitutional clients, therefore, will not \u201cdoo[m] [a]ny [f]und to\n[t]rial.\u201d Brief for Respondent 49; see alsoStrougov.BEA Assocs., 188 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d 373, 384 (SDNY 2002)\n(suggesting that fee comparisons, where permitted, might produce a\ntriable issue). First, plaintiffs bear the burden in showing that\nfees are beyond the range of arm\u2019s-length bargaining.\n\u00a780a\u201335(b)(1). Second, a showing of relevance requires courts to\nassess any disparity in fees in light of the different markets for\nadvisory services. Only where plaintiffs have shown a large\ndisparity in fees that cannot be explained by the different\nservices in addition to other evidence that the fee is outside the\narm\u2019s-length range will trial be appropriate.
