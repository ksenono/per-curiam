S. ____ (2010)SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESNO. 08-970SONNY PERDUE, GOVERNOR OF GEORGIA, et\u00a0al.,\nPETITIONERSv.KENNY A., by his next friend LINDA WINN,\net\u00a0al.on writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the eleventh circuit[April 21, 2010]Justice Thomas, concurring.Nearly 30 years ago, a group of\nattorneys sought a fee award under 42 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71988 after\n\u201cachiev[ing] only limited success\u201d litigating their clients\u2019\nconstitutional claims.Hensleyv.Eckerhart,461 U. S. 424,\n431 (1983). This Court\u2019s opinion resolving their claim for fees\nobserved that \u201cin some cases ofexceptionalsuccess an\nenhanced award\u201d of attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a71988 \u201cmay be justified.\u201dId., at 435 (emphasis added). That observation plainly was\ndicta, but one year later this Court relied on it to reject the\n\u201cargument that an \u2018upward adjustment\u2019\u00a0\u201d to the lodestar\ncalculation \u201cis never permissible.\u201dBlumv.Stenson,465 U. S. 886, 897\n(1984). Yet \u201cwe have never sustained an enhancement of a lodestar\namount for performance,\u201dante, at 8, and our jurisprudence\nsinceBlumhas charted \u201ca decisional arc that bends\ndecidedly against enhancements,\u201d 532 F.\u00a03d 1209, 1221 (CA11\n2008) (Carnes, J.). See alsoante, at 7\u20139.Today the Court holds, consistent withHensleyandBlum, that a lodestar fee award under\n\u00a71988 may be enhanced for attorney performance in a \u201cfew\u201d\ncircumstances that \u201care indeed \u2018rare\u2019 and \u2018exceptional.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAnte, at 10. But careful readers will observe the precise\nlimitations that the Court imposes on the availability of such\nenhancements. Seeante, at 10\u201312; see alsoante,\nat 1 (Kennedy, J., concurring) (\u201c[I]t must be understood that\nextraordinary cases are presented only in the rarest\ncircumstances\u201d). These limitations preserve our prior cases and\nadvance our attorney\u2019s fees jurisprudence further along the\ndecisional arc that Judge Carnes described. I agree with the\nCourt\u2019s approach and its conclusion because, as the Court\nemphasizes, seeante, at 7\u20138, the lodestar calculation\nwill in virtually every case already reflect all indicia of\nattorney performance relevant to a fee award.",
