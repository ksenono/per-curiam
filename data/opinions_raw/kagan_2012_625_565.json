CORSON, DECEASED, et\u00a0al., PETITIONERSv.RAILROAD FRICTION PRODUCTS CORPORATION et\u00a0al.on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the third circuit[February 29, 2012]Justice Kagan, concurring.Like Justice Sotomayor,post,at 1\n(opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part), I doubt this\nCourt would decideNapierv.Atlantic Coast Line R.\nCo.,272 U.S.\n605(1926), in the same way today. TheNapierCourt\nconcluded that Congress had \u201cmanifest[ed] the intention to occupy\nthe entire field of regulating locomotive equipment,\u201d based on\nnothing more than a statute granting regulatory authority over that\nsubject matter to a federal agency.Id.,at 611. Under our\nmore recent cases, Congress must do much more to oust all of state\nlaw from a field. See,e.g., New York State Dept. of Social\nServs.v.Dublino,413 U.S.\n405, 415 (1973) (rejecting preemption even though Congress had\nenacted a \u201cdetailed\u201d and \u201ccomprehensive\u201d regulatory scheme). Viewed\nthrough the lens of modern preemption law,Napieris an\nanachronism.ButNapiergoverns so long as Congress\nlets it\u2014and that decision provides a straightforward way to\ndetermine whether state laws relating to locomotive equipment are\npreempted. According toNapier, the scope of the agency\u2019s\npower under the Locomotive Inspection Act (LIA) determines the\nboundaries of the preempted field. See 272 U.\u00a0S., at 611\n(state regulations were preempted because they fell \u201cwithin the\nscope of the authority delegated to the Commission\u201d); see alsoante,at 5 (the \u201c\u00a0\u2018broad scope of the authority\u2019\u00a0\u201d\ngiven to the agency \u201cled to [Napier\u2019s] conclusion\u201d);post,at 7\u20138 (\u201c[T]he pre-empted field is congruent with the\nregulated field\u201d). And under that test, none of the state-law\nclaims at issue here can survive.All of us agree that the petitioners\u2019\ndefective-design claims are preempted.Napierrecognized the\nfederal agency\u2019s delegated authority over \u201cthe design, the\nconstruction and the material of every part of the locomotive.\u201d 272\nU.\u00a0S., at 611. In doing so,Napierdid not distinguish\nbetween \u201chazards arising from repair and maintenance\u201d of the parts\nand hazards stemming from their \u201cuse on the line.\u201dAnte,at\n7. The agency thus has authority to regulate the design of\nlocomotive equipment\u2014like the asbetos-containing brakeshoes here\u2014to\nprevent either danger. And that fact resolves the preemption\nquestion. Because the agency could have banned use of the\nbrakeshoes as designed, the petitioners\u2019 defective-design\nclaims\u2014which would effectively accomplish the identical result\u2014fall\nwithin the preempted field.So too the petitioners\u2019 failure-to-warn claims,\nand for the same reason.Napierdid not specifically address\nwarnings, because the case in no way involved them. But if an\nagency has the power to prohibit the use of locomotive equipment,\nit also has the power to condition the use of that equipment on\nproper warnings. (And that is so, contrary to Justice Sotomayor\u2019s\nview, seepost, at 8, n. 3, whether the warning is engraved\ninto the part itself or posted on the workshop wall.) Here, for\nexample, the agency need not have chosen between banning\nasbestos-containing brakeshoes and leaving them entirely\nunregulated. It could instead have required a warning about how to\nhandle those brakeshoes safely. If, say, a mask would have\nprotected a worker from risk, then the agency could have demanded a\nnotice to that effect. See,e.g.,Lawv.General\nMotors Corp.,114 F.3d 908, 911 (CA9 1997) (\u201cAs for warning requirements,\nthese too are within the scope of the [agency\u2019s] authority\u201d);Scheidingv.General Motors Corp.,22 Cal. 4th 471, 484,993 P.2d 996, 1004 (2000) (same).[1] And because the agency could have required warnings\nabout the equipment\u2019s use, the petitioners\u2019 failure-to-warn claims,\nno less than their defective-design claims, are preempted underNapier.I understand these views to comport with the\nCourt\u2019s opinion in this case, and I accordingly join it in\nfull.Notes1Justice Sotomayor argues\nthat \u201cpreserving petitioners\u2019 failure-to-warn claims coheres with\nthe LIA\u2019s regulatory regime\u201d because the agency disclaims authority\nover locomotive repair and maintenance.Post,at 7.But that claim conflates two separate distinctions. The agency\ndraws a line not between mandating design changes and mandating\nwarnings, but between regulating equipment that is hazardous to\nrepair and regulating equipment that is hazardous to use on the\nrailroad line. In keeping with that analysis, the agency contends\nthat the petitioners\u2019 design-defect claims also fall outside the\npreempted field because the alleged defect in the brakeshoes\nrendered dangerous only their repair, and not their on-line use.\nSee Brief for United States asAmicus Curiae12\u201313. The\nagency\u2019s understanding of its author-ity therefore does not support\nJustice Sotomayor\u2019s position. As the agency agrees, the\npetitioners\u2019 claims must stand or fall together if viewed through\nthe lens of the agency\u2019s regulatory authority. In my view, they\nfall because the Court rightly rejects the agency\u2019s proffered\ndistinction between regulating the dangers of repairing equipment\nand regulating the dangers of using that equipment on line.
