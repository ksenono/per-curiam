    "text": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES_________________No. 14\u20131373_________________UTAH, PETITIONERv.EDWARDJOSEPH\nSTRIEFF, JR.on writ of certiorari to the supreme court of\nutah[June 20, 2016]Justice Sotomayor, with whom Justice Ginsburg\njoins as to Parts I, II, and III, dissenting.The Court today holds that the discovery of a\nwarrant for an unpaid parking ticket will forgive a police\nofficer\u2019s violation of your Fourth Amendment rights. Do not be\nsoothed by the opinion\u2019s technical language: This case allows the\npolice to stop you on the street, demand your identification, and\ncheck it for outstanding traffic warrants\u2014even if you are doing\nnothing wrong. If the officer discovers a warrant for a fine you\nforgot to pay, courts will now excuse his illegal stop and will\nadmit into evidence anything he happens to find by searching you\nafter arresting you on the warrant. Because the Fourth Amendment\nshould prohibit, not permit, such misconduct, I dissent.IMinutes after Edward Strieff walked out of a\nSouth Salt Lake City home, an officer stopped him, questioned him,\nand took his identification to run it through a police database.\nThe officer did not suspect that Strieff had done anything wrong.\nStrieff just happened to be the first person to leave a house that\nthe officer thought might contain \u201cdrug activity.\u201d App. 16\u201319.As the State of Utah concedes, this stop was\nillegal. App. 24. The Fourth Amendment protects people from\n\u201cunreasonable searches and seizures.\u201d An officer breaches that\nprotection when he detains a pedestrian to check his license\nwithout any evidence that the person is engaged in a crime.Delawarev.Prouse, 440 U.\u00a0S. 648, 663 (1979) ;Terryv.Ohio, 392 U.\u00a0S. 1, 21 (1968) . The\nofficer deepens the breach when he prolongs the detention just to\nfish further for evidence of wrongdoing.Rodriguezv.United States, 575 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___\u2013___ (2015) (slip op.,\nat 6\u20137). In his search for lawbreaking, the officer in this case\nhimself broke the law.The officer learned that Strieff had a \u201csmall\ntraffic warrant.\u201d App. 19. Pursuant to that warrant, he arrested\nStrieff and, conducting a search incident to the arrest, discovered\nmethamphetamine in Strieff\u2019s pockets.Utah charged Strieff with illegal drug\npossession. Before trial, Strieff argued that admitting the drugs\ninto evidence would condone the officer\u2019s misbehavior. The\nmethamphetamine, he reasoned, was the product of the officer\u2019s\nillegal stop. Admitting it would tell officers that unlawfully\ndiscovering even a \u201csmall traffic warrant\u201d would give them license\nto search for evidence of unrelated offenses. The Utah Supreme\nCourt unanimously agreed with Strieff. A majority of this Court now\nreverses.IIIt is tempting in a case like this, where\nillegal conduct by an officer uncovers illegal conduct by a\ncivilian, to forgive the officer. After all, his instincts,\nalthough unconstitutional, were correct. But a basic principle lies\nat the heart of the Fourth Amendment: Two wrongs don\u2019t make a\nright. SeeWeeksv.United States, 232 U.\u00a0S.\n383, 392 (1914) . When \u201clawless police conduct\u201d uncovers evidence\nof lawless civilian conduct, this Court has long required later\ncriminal trials to exclude the illegally obtained evidence.Terry, 392 U.\u00a0S., at 12;Mappv.Ohio,\n367 U.\u00a0S. 643, 655 (1961) . For example, if an officer breaks\ninto a home and finds a forged check lying around, that check may\nnot be used to prosecute the homeowner for bank fraud. We would\ndescribe the check as \u201c\u00a0\u2018fruit of the poisonous tree.\u2019\u00a0\u201dWong Sunv.United States, 371 U.\u00a0S. 471, 488\n(1963) . Fruit that must be cast aside includes not only evidence\ndirectly found by an illegal search but also evidence \u201ccome at by\nexploitation of that illegality.\u201dIbid.This \u201cexclusionary rule\u201d removes an incentive\nfor officers to search us without proper justification.Terry, 392 U.\u00a0S.,at 12.It also keeps\ncourts from being \u201cmade party to lawless invasions of the\nconstitutional rights of citizens by permitting unhindered\ngovernmental use of the fruits of such invasions.\u201dId.,at\n13. When courts admit only lawfully obtained evidence, they\nencourage \u201cthose who formulate law enforcement polices, and the\nofficers who implement them, to incorporate Fourth Amendment ideals\ninto their value system.\u201dStonev.Powell, 428\nU.\u00a0S. 465, 492 (1976) . But when courts admit illegally\nobtained evidence as well, they reward \u201cmanifest neglect if not an\nopen defiance of the prohibitions of the Constitution.\u201dWeeks, 232 U.\u00a0S., at 394.Applying the exclusionary rule, the Utah Supreme\nCourt correctly decided that Strieff\u2019s drugs must be excluded\nbecause the officer exploited his illegal stop to discover them.\nThe officer found the drugs only after learning of Strieff\u2019s\ntraffic violation; and he learned of Strieff\u2019s traffic violation\nonly because he unlawfully stopped Strieff to check his driver\u2019s\nlicense.The court also correctly rejected the State\u2019s\nargument that the officer\u2019s discovery of a traffic warrant\nunspoiled the poisonous fruit. The State analogizes finding the\nwarrant to one of our earlier decisions,Wong Sunv.United States. There, an officer illegally arrested a person\nwho, days later, voluntarily returned to the station to confess to\ncommitting a crime. 371 U.\u00a0S., at 491. Even though the person\nwould not have confessed \u201cbut for the illegal actions of the\npolice,\u201did.,at 488, we noted that the police did not\nexploit their illegal arrest to obtain the confession,id.,at 491.Because the confession was obtained by \u201cmeans\nsufficiently distinguishable\u201d from the constitutional violation, we\nheld that it could be admitted into evidence.Id.,at 488,\n491.The State contends that the search incident to the\nwarrant-arrest here is similarly distinguishable from the illegal\nstop.ButWong Sunexplains why Strieff\u2019s drugs\nmust be excluded. We reasoned that a Fourth Amendment violation may\nnot color every investigation that follows but it certainly stains\nthe actions of officers who exploit the infraction. We\ndistinguished evidence obtained by innocuous means from evidence\nobtained by exploiting misconduct after considering a variety of\nfactors: whether a long time passed, whether there were\n\u201cintervening circumstances,\u201d and whether the purpose or flagrancy\nof the misconduct was \u201ccalculated\u201d to procure the evidence.Brownv.Illinois, 422 U.\u00a0S. 590 \u2013604\n(1975).These factors confirm that the officer in this\ncase discovered Strieff\u2019s drugs by exploiting his own illegal\nconduct. The officer did not ask Strieff to volunteer his name only\nto find out, days later, that Strieff had a warrant against him.\nThe officer illegally stopped Strieff and immediately ran a warrant\ncheck. The officer\u2019s discovery of a warrant was not some\nintervening surprise that he could not have anticipated. Utah lists\nover 180,000 misdemeanor warrants in its database, and at the time\nof the arrest, Salt Lake County had a \u201cbacklog of outstanding\nwarrants\u201d so large that it faced the \u201cpotential for civil\nliability.\u201d See Dept. of Justice, Bureau of Justice\nStatistics,Survey of State Criminal History Information Systems,\n2014 (2015) (Systems Survey) (Table 5a), online at\nhttps://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/bjs/grants/249799.pdf (all Internet\nmaterials as last visited June 16, 2016); Inst. for Law and Policy\nPlanning, Salt Lake County Crim-inal Justice System Assessment 6.7\n(2004), online at\nhttp://www.\u00a0slco.org\u00a0/\u00a0cjac\u00a0/\u00a0resources\u00a0/\u00a0SaltLakeCJSAfinal.pdf.\nThe officer\u2019s violation was also calculated to procure evidence.\nHis sole reason for stopping Strieff, he acknowledged, was\ninvestigative\u2014he wanted to discover whether drug activity was going\non in the house Strieff had just exited. App. 17.The warrant check, in other words, was not an\n\u201cintervening circumstance\u201d separating the stop from the search for\ndrugs. It was part and parcel of the officer\u2019s illegal \u201cexpedition\nfor evidence in the hope that something might turn up.\u201dBrown, 422 U.\u00a0S., at 605. Under our precedents, because\nthe officer found Strieff\u2019s drugs by exploiting his own\nconstitutional violation, the drugs should be excluded.IIIAThe Court sees things differently. To the\nCourt, the fact that a warrant gives an officer cause to arrest a\nperson severs the connection between illegal policing and the\nresulting discovery of evidence.Ante,at 7. This is a\nremarkable proposition: The mere existence of a warrant not only\ngives an officer legal cause to arrest and search a person, it also\nforgives an officer who, with no knowledge of the warrant at all,\nunlawfully stops that person on a whim or hunch.To explain its reasoning, the Court relies onSegurav.United States, 468 U.\u00a0S. 796 (1984) .\nThere, federal agents applied for a warrant to search an apartment\nbut illegally entered the apartment to secure it before the judge\nissued the warrant.Id.,at 800\u2013801. After receiving the\nwarrant, the agents then searched the apartment for drugs.Id.,at 801. The question before us was what to do with the\nevidence the agents then discovered. We declined to suppress it\nbecause \u201c[t]he illegal entry into petitioners\u2019 apartment did not\ncontribute in any way to discovery of the evidence seized under the\nwarrant.\u201dId.,at 815.According to the majority,Segurainvolves facts \u201csimilar\u201d to this case and \u201csuggest[s]\u201d that a valid\nwarrant will clean up whatever illegal conduct uncovered it.Ante,at 6\u20137. It is difficult to understand this\ninterpretation. InSegura, the agents\u2019 illegal conduct in\nentering the apartment had nothing to do with their procurement of\na search warrant. Here, the officer\u2019s illegal conduct in stopping\nStrieff was essential to his discovery of an arrest warrant.Segurawould be similar only if the agents used information\nthey illegally obtained from the apartment to procure a search\nwarrant or discover an arrest warrant. Precisely because that was\nnot the case, the Court admitted the untainted evidence. 468\nU.\u00a0S., at 814.The majority likewise misses the point when it\ncalls the warrant check here a \u201c\u00a0\u2018negligibly burdensome\nprecautio[n]\u2019\u00a0\u201d taken for the officer\u2019s \u201csafety.\u201dAnte,at 8 (quotingRodriguez, 575 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 7)). Remember, the officer stopped Strieff without suspecting\nhim of committing any crime. By his own account, the officer did\nnot fear Strieff. Moreover, the safety rationale we discussed inRodriguez, an opinion about highway patrols, is\nconspicuously absent here. A warrant check on a highway \u201censur[es]\nthat vehicles on the road are operated safely and responsibly.\u201dId., at ___ (slip op., at 6). We allow such checks during\nlegal traffic stops because the legitimacy of a person\u2019s driver\u2019s\nlicense has a \u201cclose connection to roadway safety.\u201dId.,at\n___ (slip op., at 7). A warrant check of a pedestrian on a\nsidewalk, \u201cby contrast, is a measure aimed at \u2018detect[ing] evidence\nof ordinary criminal wrongdoing.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIbid.(quotingIndianapolisv.Edmond, 531 U.\u00a0S. 32 \u201341\n(2000)). Surely we would not allow officers to warrant-check random\njoggers, dog walkers, and lemonade vendors just to ensure they pose\nno threat to anyone else.The majority also posits that the officer could\nnot have exploited his illegal conduct because he did not violate\nthe Fourth Amendment on purpose. Rather, he made \u201cgood-faith\nmistakes.\u201dAnte,at 8. Never mind that the officer\u2019s sole\npurpose was to fish for evidence. The majority casts his\nunconstitutional actions as \u201cnegligent\u201d and therefore incapable of\nbeing deterred by the exclusionary rule.Ibid.But the Fourth Amendment does not tolerate an\nofficer\u2019s unreasonable searches and seizures just because he did\nnot know any better. Even officers prone to negligence can learn\nfrom courts that exclude illegally obtained evidence.Stone,\n428 U.\u00a0S., at 492. Indeed, they are perhaps the most in need\nof the education, whether by the judge\u2019s opinion, the prosecutor\u2019s\nfuture guidance, or an updated manual on criminal procedure. If the\nofficers are in doubt about what the law requires, exclusion gives\nthem an \u201cincentive to err on the side of constitutional behavior.\u201dUnited Statesv.Johnson, 457 U.\u00a0S. 537, 561\n(1982) .BMost striking about the Court\u2019s opinion is its\ninsistence that the event here was \u201cisolated,\u201d with \u201cno indication\nthat this unlawful stop was part of any systemic or recurrent\npolice misconduct.\u201dAnte, at 8\u20139. Respectfully, nothing\nabout this case is isolated.Outstanding warrants are surprisingly common.\nWhen a person with a traffic ticket misses a fine payment or court\nappearance, a court will issue a warrant. See,e.g.,Brennan\nCenter for Justice, Criminal Justice Debt 23 (2010), online at\nhttps://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/legacy/Fees%20and%20Fines%20FINAL.pdf.\nWhen a person on probation drinks alcohol or breaks curfew, a court\nwill issue a warrant. See,e.g.,Human Rights Watch,\nProfiting from Probation 1, 51 (2014), online at\nhttps://www.hrw.org/report/2014/02/05/profiting-probation/\u00a0americas\u00a0-\u00a0offender\u00a0-\u00a0funded\u00a0-\u00a0probation-industry.\nThe States and Federal Government maintain databases with over 7.8\nmillion outstanding warrants, the vast majority of which appear to\nbe for minor offenses. See Systems Survey (Table 5a). Even these\nsources may not track the \u201cstaggering\u201d numbers of warrants,\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018drawers and drawers\u2019\u00a0\u201d full, that many cities issue\nfor traffic violations and ordinance infractions.

The county in this case\nhas had a \u201cbacklog\u201d of such warrants. Seesupra,at 4. The\nDepartment of Justice recently reported that in the town of\nFerguson, Missouri, with a population of 21,000, 16,000 people had\noutstanding warrants against them. Ferguson Report, at 6, 55.Justice Department investigations across the\ncountry have illustrated how these astounding numbers of warrants\ncan be used by police to stop people without cause. In a single\nyear in New Orleans, officers \u201cmade nearly 60,000 arrests, of which\nabout 20,000 were of people with outstanding traffic or misdemeanor\nwarrants from neighboring parishes for such infractions as unpaid\ntickets.\u201d Dept. of Justice, Civil Rights Div., Investigation of the\nNew Orleans Police Department 29 (2011), online at\nhttps://www.justice.gov\u00a0/\u00a0sites\u00a0/\u00a0default\u00a0/\u00a0files\u00a0/\u00a0crt\u00a0/\u00a0legacy/2011/03/17/nopd_report.pdf.\nIn the St.\u00a0Louis metropolitan area, officers \u201croutinely\u201d stop\npeople\u2014on the street, at bus stops, or even in court\u2014for no reason\nother than \u201can officer\u2019s desire to check whether the subject had a\nmunicipal arrest warrant pending.\u201d Ferguson Report, at 49,\n57.In Newark, New Jersey, officers stopped 52,235\npedestrians within a 4-year period and ran warrant checks on 39,308\nof them. Dept. of Justice, Civil Rights Div., Investigation of the\nNewark Police Department 8, 19, n.\u00a015 (2014), online at\nhttps://www.justice.gov/sites\u00a0\u00a0/default\u00a0\u00a0/\u00a0\u00a0files\u00a0\u00a0/\u00a0crt\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0/legacy\u00a0\u00a0/\u00a0\u00a02014\u00a0\u00a0/\u00a0\u00a007\u00a0/\u00a0\u00a022\u00a0\u00a0/\u00a0\u00a0newark\u00a0\u00a0_\u00a0\u00a0findings\u00a0\u00a0_7-22-14.pdf.\nThe Justice Department analyzed these warrant-checked stops and\nreported that \u201capproximately 93% of the stops would have been\nconsidered unsupported by articulated reason-able suspicion.\u201dId.,at 9, n.\u00a07.I do not doubt that most officers act in \u201cgood\nfaith\u201d and do not set out to break the law. That does not mean\nthese stops are \u201cisolated instance[s] of negligence,\u201d however.Ante,at 8. Many are the product of institutionalized\ntraining procedures. The New York City Police Department long\ntrained officers to, in the words of a District Judge, \u201cstop and\nquestion first, develop reasonable suspicion later.\u201dLigonv.New York, 925 F. Supp. 2d 478, 537\u2013538 (SDNY), stay\ngranted on other grounds, 736 F.\u00a03d 118 (CA2 2013). The Utah\nSupreme Court described as \u201c\u00a0\u2018routine procedure\u2019 or \u2018common\npractice\u2019\u00a0\u201d the decision of Salt Lake City police officers to\nrun warrant checks on pedestrians they detained without reasonable\nsuspicion.Statev.Topanotes, 2003 UT 30, \u00b62, 76\nP.\u00a03d 1159, 1160. In the related context of traffic stops, one\nwidely followed police manual instructs officers looking for drugs\nto \u201crun at least a warrants check on all drivers you stop.\nStatistically, narcotics offenders are .\u00a0.\u00a0. more likely\nto fail to appear on simple citations, such as traffic or trespass\nviolations, leading to the issuance of bench warrants. Discovery of\nan outstanding warrant gives you cause for an immediate custodial\narrest and search of the suspect.\u201d C. Remsberg, Tactics for\nCriminal Patrol 205\u2013206 (1995); C. Epp et\u00a0al., Pulled Over 23,\n33\u201336 (2014).The majority does not suggest what makes this\ncase \u201cisolated\u201d from these and countless other examples. Nor does\nit offer guidance for how a defendant can prove that his arrest was\nthe result of \u201cwidespread\u201d misconduct. Surely it should not take a\nfederal investigation of Salt Lake County before the Court would\nprotect someone in Strieff\u2019s position.IVWriting only for myself, and drawing on my\nprofessional experiences, I would add that unlawful \u201cstops\u201d have\nsevere consequences much greater than the inconvenience suggested\nby the name. This Court has given officers an array of instruments\nto probe and examine you. When we condone officers\u2019 use of these\ndevices without adequate cause, we give them reason to target\npedestrians in an arbitrary manner. We also risk treating members\nof our communities as second-class citizens.Although many Americans have been stopped for\nspeeding or jaywalking, few may realize how degrading a stop can be\nwhen the officer is looking for more. This Court has allowed an\nofficer to stop you for whatever reason he wants\u2014so long as he can\npoint to a pretextual justification after the fact.Whrenv.United States, 517 U.\u00a0S. 806, 813 (1996) . That\njustification must provide specific reasons why the officer\nsuspected you were breaking the law,Terry, 392 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 21, but it may factor in your ethnicity,United Statesv.Brignoni-Ponce, 422 U.\u00a0S. 873 \u2013887 (1975), where you\nlive,Adamsv.Williams, 407 U.\u00a0S. 143, 147\n(1972) , what you were wearing,United Statesv.Sokolow, 490 U.\u00a0S. 1 \u20135 (1989), and how you behaved,Illinoisv.Wardlow, 528 U.\u00a0S. 119 \u2013125 (2000).\nThe officer does not even need to know which law you might have\nbroken so long as he can later point to any possible\ninfraction\u2014even one that is minor, unrelated, or ambiguous.Devenpeckv.Alford, 543 U.\u00a0S. 146 \u2013155 (2004);Heienv.North Carolina, 574 U.\u00a0S. ___\n(2014).The indignity of the stop is not limited to an\nofficer telling you that you look like a criminal. See Epp, Pulled\nOver, at 5. The officer may next ask for your \u201cconsent\u201d to inspect\nyour bag or purse without telling you that you can decline. SeeFloridav.Bostick, 501 U.\u00a0S. 429, 438 (1991) .\nRegardless of your answer, he may order you to stand \u201chelpless,\nperhaps facing a wall with [your] hands raised.\u201dTerry, 392\nU.\u00a0S., at 17. If the officer thinks you might be dangerous, he\nmay then \u201cfrisk\u201d you for weapons. This involves more than just a\npat down. As onlookers pass by, the officer may \u201c\u00a0\u2018feel with\nsensitive fingers every portion of [your] body. A thorough search\n[may] be made of [your] arms and armpits, waistline and back, the\ngroin and area about the testicles, and entire surface of the legs\ndown to the feet.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId.,at 17, n.\u00a013.The officer\u2019s control over you does not end with\nthe stop. If the officer chooses, he may handcuff you and take you\nto jail for doing nothing more than speeding, jaywalking, or\n\u201cdriving [your] pickup truck .\u00a0.\u00a0. with [your] 3-year-old\nson and 5-year-old daughter .\u00a0.\u00a0. without [your] seatbelt\nfastened.\u201dAtwaterv.Lago Vista, 532 U.\u00a0S. 318\n\u2013324 (2001).

Even if you are\ninnocent, you will now join the 65 million Americans with an arrest\nrecord and experience the \u201ccivil death\u201d of discrimination by\nemployers, landlords, and whoever else conducts a background check.\nChin, The New Civil Death, 160 U. Pa. L.\u00a0Rev. 1789, 1805\n(2012); see J. Jacobs, The Eternal Criminal Record 33\u201351 (2015);\nYoung & Petersilia, Keeping Track, 129 Harv. L.\u00a0Rev. 1318,\n1341\u20131357 (2016). And, of course, if you fail to pay bail or appear\nfor court, a judge will issue a warrant to render you \u201carrestable\non sight\u201d in the future. A. Goffman, On the Run 196 (2014).This case involves asuspicionlessstop,\none in which the officer initiated this chain of events without\njustification. As the Justice Department notes,supra, at 8,\nmany innocent people are subjected to the humiliations of these\nunconstitutional searches. The white defendant in this case shows\nthat anyone\u2019s dignity can be violated in this manner. See M.\nGottschalk, Caught 119\u2013138 (2015). But it is no secret that people\nof color are disproportionate victims of this type of scrutiny. See\nM. Alexander, The New Jim Crow 95\u2013136 (2010). For generations,\nblack and brown parents have given their children \u201cthe\ntalk\u201d\u2014instructing them never to run down the street; always keep\nyour hands where they can be seen; do not even think of talking\nback to a stranger\u2014all out of fear of how an officer with a gun\nwill react to them. See,e.g.,W. E. B. Du Bois, The Souls\nof Black Folk (1903); J. Baldwin, The Fire Next Time (1963); T.\nCoates, Between the World and Me (2015).By legitimizing the conduct that produces this\ndouble consciousness, this case tells everyone, white and black,\nguilty and innocent, that an officer can verify your legal status\nat any time. It says that your body is subject to invasion while\ncourts excuse the violation of your rights. It implies that you are\nnot a citizen of a democracy but the subject of a carceral state,\njust waiting to be cataloged.We must not pretend that the countless people\nwho are routinely targeted by police are \u201cisolated.\u201d They are the\ncanaries in the coal mine whose deaths, civil and literal, warn us\nthat no one can breathe in this atmosphere. See L. Guinier & G.\nTorres, The Miner\u2019s Canary 274\u2013283 (2002). They are the ones who\nrecognize that unlawful police stops corrode all our civil\nliberties and threaten all our lives. Until their voices matter\ntoo, our justice system will continue to be anything but.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*I dissent.",
