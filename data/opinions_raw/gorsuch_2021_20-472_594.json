But when it first adopted\nthese mandates, Congress temporarily exempted small refineries\nacross the board. Looking beyond that initial period, Congress\nauthorized individual small refineries to apply for additional\nhardship \u201cextensions\u201d from the federal government \u201cat any time.\u201d\nThe question before us is whether a small refinery that manages to\ncomply with renewable fuel mandates in one year is forever\nforbidden from applying for an \u201cextension\u201d in any future year.IIn 2005 and 2007, Congress created the\nrenewable fuel program (RFP). \u00a7\u00a7201, 202(a)(1), 121Stat. 1519, 42\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a77545(o)(1)(J), (o)(1)(L),\n(o)(2)(A)(i). For 2006, Congress ordained the inclusion of 4\nbillion gallons of renewable fuel in the Nation\u2019s fuel supply.\n\u00a77545(o)(2)(B)(i)(I). By 2022, the number will climb to 36\nbillion gallons.Ibid.For years after that, Congress has\nlargely left it to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to set\nthe applicable volumes. \u00a77545(o)(2)(B)(ii).From the start, EPA has apportioned the\nnationwide volume mandates into individualized ones for each\nrefinery. \u00a77545(o)(3)(B); 40 CFR \u00a780.1407(a) (2020). The\nAgency polices these mandates with a system of credits. Each credit\nrepresents the blending of a certain quantity of renewable fuel. 42\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a77545(o)(5)(A)(i); 40 CFR \u00a7\u00a780.1415,\n80.1429. A refinery that blends renewables may either \u201cretire\u201d the\ncredits it has earned (i.e., use them) to satisfy its own\nRFP volume obligation\u2014or sell those credits to a different producer\nthat needs them. 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a77545(o)(5)(B); 40\nCFR \u00a7\u00a780.1425\u201380.1427. Any given refinery may therefore comply with\nthe law thanks to its own blending efforts, the purchase of credits\nfrom someone else, or a combination of both.Congress tempered its mandates in other ways\ntoo. For example, if a refinery is unable to generate or purchase\nsufficient credits in a given year, it may \u201ccarry forward\u201d any\ndeficit to the following year. 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a77545(o)(5)(D). But this reprieve has a snowball effect. The\nnext year, the refinery must offset the deficit it carried forward.\n\u00a77545(o)(5)(D)(ii). Elsewhere, Congress authorized more\nsweeping relief: EPA may waive RFP obligations in a particular\nState or region if it determines they \u201cwould severely harm the\neconomy or environment\u201d or if \u201cthere is an inadequate domestic\nsupply.\u201d \u00a77545(o)(7)(A). That waiver lasts for only one\nyear, \u201cbut [it] may be renewed.\u201d \u00a77545(o)(7)(C).Most important for our case, however, is a\ndifferent, if related, set of tempering features. Evidently,\nCongress was concerned that escalating RFP obligations could work\nspecial burdens on small refineries that lack the \u201cinherent scale\nadvantages of large refineries,\u201dSinclair Wyoming Refining\nCo.v.EPA, 887 F.3d 986, 989 (CA10 2017), and sometimes\nsupply a major source of jobs in rural communities, Brief for State\nof Wyoming et\u00a0al. asAmici Curiae19\u201325. To protect\nsmall refineries that produce (on average) fewer than 75,000\nbarrels a day \u201cfor a calendar year,\u201d \u00a77545(o)(1)(K),\nCongress created a blanket exemption from RFP obligations \u201cuntil\ncalendar year 2011,\u201d \u00a77545(o)(9)(A)(i). Congress also\ndirected EPA to \u201cextend the exemption under clause (i)\u201d for at\nleast two years if the Secretary of Energy determined RFP\nobligations would impose \u201ca disproportionate economic hardship\u201d on\na given small refinery. \u00a77545(o)(9)(A)(ii). Accordingly,\nsubparagraph (A) anticipated temporary relief until 2011 or at\nleast 2013. In the next subparagraph, the one most squarely at\nissue before us, Congress offered the possibility of still further\nrelief in future years: \u201cA small refinery may at any time petition\nthe Administrator for an extension of the exemption under\nsubparagraph (A) for the reason of disproportionate economic\nhardship.\u201d \u00a77545(o)(9)(B)(i).Here\u2019s how things played out for small\nrefineries once the law went into effect. Under subparagraph\n(A)(i), all small refineries were exempt through 2010. See Dept. of\nEnergy, Office of Policy and International Affairs, D. Vashishat\net\u00a0al., Small Refinery Exemption Study 25 (Mar. 2011). In\n2011, EPA extended that exemption for 13 small refineries under\nsubparagraph (A)(ii)\u2014and it extended the exemption for an\nadditional 11 small refineries under subparagraph (B)(i).Id., at 37. As time went on, and as economic conditions\nfluctuated, EPA extended more exemptions under subparagraph (B)(i)\nin some years than in others. For example, EPA granted 8 extensions\nin 2013, but expanded that number to 31 in 2018. EPA, RFS Small\nRefinery Exemptions, (May 20, 2021), https://www.epa.gov/fuels-\nregistration-reporting-and-compliance-help\u00a0/\u00a0rfs-small-refinery-exemptions.This case concerns three small refineries that\ninitially received an exemption, saw it lapse for a period, and\nthen petitioned for an exemption again under subparagraph (B)(i).\nHollyFrontier Woods Cross Refining LLC received only the blanket\nexemption under subparagraph (A)(i) through 2010. SeeRenewable\nFuels Assn. v.EPA, 948 F.3d 1206, 1228 (CA10 2020).\nWynnewood Refining Company received the blanket exemption under\nsubparagraph (A)(i) and a 2-year extension under subparagraph\n(A)(ii) through 2012.Id.,at 1229. HollyFrontier Cheyenne\nRefining LLC received subparagraph (A)(i)\u2019s blanket exemption,\nsubparagraph (A)(ii)\u2019s 2-year extension, and then subparagraph\n(B)(i)\u2019s hardship exemption in 2015.Id., at 1227. After a\nlull, all three refineries petitioned for a hardship exemption\nunder subparagraph (B)(i) in 2017 or 2018. EPA granted all\nthree.A group of renewable fuel producers objected.\nThey petitioned for review of EPA\u2019s decisions in the Tenth Circuit,\narguing the Agency acted \u201cin excess of statutory jurisdiction,\nauthority, or limitations\u201d by granting the petitions. 5\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7706(2)(C). The court vacated EPA\u2019s decisions.\nIt concluded the refineries were ineligible for an \u201cextension\u201d of\ntheir exemptions because all three had allowed their exemptions to\nlapse at some point in the past. 948 F.\u00a03d, at 1249. We\ngranted review to consider the question for ourselves. 592\nU.\u00a0S. ___ (2021).IIAWhere Congress does not furnish a definition\nof its own, we generally seek to afford a statutory term \u201cits\nordinary or natural meaning.\u201dFDICv.Meyer,510 U.S.\n471, 476 (1994). Before us, the parties agree on one thing: The\nkey word here\u2014\u201cextension\u201d\u2014is nowhere defined in the statute and it\ncan mean different things depending on context.Sometimes, as the renewable fuel producers\nobserve and the court of appeals held, an \u201cextension\u201d can refer to\nan increase in time. See,e.g., 5 Oxford English Dictionary\n597 (2d ed. 1989) (OED) (\u201cEnlargement in duration\u201d); 7\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7940f(a) (\u201cextension of the final maturity\u201d of a\nfederal loan). In other settings, as the small refineries\nemphasize, an \u201cextension\u201d can mean the offering or making something\navailable to someone, such as the granting of a benefit. See,e.g., 5 OED 595 (\u201c[t]o hold out, accord, grant\u201d); 15\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71141e(a) (\u201cextension of [intellectual property]\nprotection\u201d). These definitional differences matter too. If\nCongress used the term in the second sense, everyone before us\nseems to accept the court of appeals erred: Just because a small\nrefinery\u2019s first exemption lapsed, nothing would foreclose the\ngovernment from extending\u2014in the sense of granting or conferring\u2014a\nsecond exemption later.Ultimately, however, we agree with the renewable\nfuel producers and the court of appeals that subparagraph (B)(i)\nuses \u201cextension\u201d in its temporal sense\u2014referring to the lengthening\nof a period of time. We find three textual clues telling. First,\nthe initial exemption described in subparagraph (A)(i) is described\ntemporally (as lasting \u201cuntil calendar year 2011\u201d). 42\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a77545(o)(9)(A)(i). Second, the next\nexemption described in subparagraph (A)(ii) speaks temporally too,\nand it does so using a variation of the very term in\ndispute\u2014authorizing EPA to \u201cextendthe exemption under\nclause (i) for the small refinery for a period of not less than 2\nyears.\u201d \u00a77545(o)(9)(A)(ii)(II) (emphasis added). Finally,\nsubparagraph (A)(ii) and subparagraph (B)(i) share an identical\ntitle\u2014\u201cExtension of exemption\u201d\u2014underscoring the likelihood that the\ntwo neighboring provisions use the term \u201cextension\u201d in one\nconsistent sense. Nor do we see any persuasive countervailing\nevidence that Congress meant to adopt one meaning of the term in\nsubparagraph (A)(ii) and a different one next door in subparagraph\n(B)(i). SeeHensonv.Santander Consumer USA Inc.,\n582 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 5) (absent contrary\nevidence, this Court normally presumes consistent usage).BResolving that much, however, does not resolve\nthis case. Really, it only takes us to the heart of the dispute.\nThe Tenth Circuit didn\u2019t just hold that an extension means an\nincrease in time\u2014it imposed a continuity requirement. On that\ncourt\u2019s view, a small refinery becomes permanently ineligible for a\nfurther extension of time once its exemption lapses. Even accepting\nthat subparagraph (B)(i) uses the term \u201cextension\u201d in its temporal\nsense, the small refineries submit this was error. On their view,\nsmall refineries whose exemptions have lapsed in one year may still\nseek an \u201cextension\u201d in a following year. Indeed, the small\nrefineries candidly characterize this as their stronger argument\nfor reversal.We agree. It is entirely natural\u2014and consistent\nwith ordinary usage\u2014to seek an \u201cextension\u201d of time even after some\nlapse. Think of the forgetful student who asks for an \u201cextension\u201d\nfor a term paper after the deadline has passed, the tenant who does\nthe same after overstaying his lease, or parties who negotiate an\n\u201cextension\u201d of a contract after its expiration. Perhaps for reasons\nlike these, the respondents and court of appeals are unable to\npoint to a single dictionary definition of the term \u201cextension\u201d\nrequiring unbroken continuity. To be sure, some definitions speak\nof an extension as a \u201ccontinuation.\u201d See,e.g., Black\u2019s Law\nDictionary 703 (10th ed. 2014) (defining \u201cextension\u201d as \u201c[t]hecontinuationof the same contract for a specified period\u201d\n(emphasis added)). And the dissent urges us to read \u201cextension\u201d to\nmean \u201ccontinuation.\u201dPost, at 2 (opinion of Barrett, J.).\nBut eventhatterm can denote a resumption after some\ninterrupting lapse. See,e.g., 3 OED 828 (defining\n\u201ccontinuation\u201d as \u201cthe resumption of any interrupted action or\ncourse\u201d); Webster\u2019s New Collegiate Dictionary 180 (1946) (defining\n\u201ccontinuation\u201d as the \u201c[a]ct of continuing; esp. a resumption\u201d); B.\nGarner, Modern English Usage 214 (4th ed. 2016).Much federal law proceeds on this same\nunderstanding. Under certain circumstances, a court \u201cmay\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. extend\u201d a party\u2019s \u201ctime for appeal\u201d even \u201cafter the\nexpiration of the time otherwise set for bringing appeal.\u201d 28\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72107(c). In other words, the timer can start,\nrun, finish, and thenrestart\u2014because a court has the power\nto \u201cextend\u201d the time allotted even after a lapse. Likewise, the\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure prescribe all sorts of rules about\n\u201c[w]hen an act may or must be done within a specified time\u201d in\ntrial court proceedings. Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.\u00a06(b)(1). And for\nalmost all rules prescribing a deadline, a district court may\n\u201cextend the time\u201d even \u201cafter the time has expired.\u201dIbid.;\ncf. Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 6(b)(2). More than a few lawyers and\nclients have taken advantage of \u201cextensions\u201d of just these\nsorts.Still other examples exist. Maybe most notably,\njust last year Congress twice passed laws providing for the\n\u201cextension\u201d of public benefits that had lapsed or been interrupted.\nSee Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021, Pub. L. 116\u2013260, \u00a7203,\n134Stat. 1182 (providing an \u201cextension\u201d of unemployment\ncompensation starting on December 26, 2020, after lapsing on July\n31, 2020); Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, Pub.\nL. 116\u2013136, \u00a72114, 134Stat. 281 (providing an \u201cextension\u201d of\nunemployment benefits starting in 2020, after lapsing in 2013). The\ndissent gives these particular examples short shrift because they\nappear in statutes \u201cpassed in an emergency context\u201d a decade after\nthe statute at issue here.Post, at 7. We do not doubt that\nmeaning may change with time, but unless the dissent thinks the\nordinary meaning of \u201cextension\u201d changed in just 10 years, it\u2019s hard\nto understand why these enactments don\u2019t shed at least some light\non today\u2019s question. If anything, the emergency context in which\nthese laws were passed\u2014forcing legislators to use a term on short\nnotice\u2014would seem to provide useful evidence of ordinary\nmeaning.Beyond that, the dissent counters by attempting\nto recast all these varied examples of temporal extensions after\ninterruption. It imagines, for example, that when a teacher extends\na paper deadline after a lapse, that act of grace always operates\nlike anunc pro tuncjudicial decree\u2014retroactively deeming\nthe time originally allotted as now extending continuously to some\nnew and future due date. But no one thinks extensions always work\nthis way. As the COVID-19 statutes illustrate, a previously lapsed\nbenefit can and sometimes is \u201cextended\u201d for a new period without\nany retroactive effect. Likewise, if a student misses the 4 p.m.\ndeadline on Friday, his teacher may extend the deadline by\nauthorizing him to hand in his paper the following Monday between 8\na.m. and 9 a.m. Besides, even looking to thenunc pro tuncanalogy, what does it prove? It cannot change the fact that, absent\ntime travel, a lapse or interruption has occurred. The student\ncannot go back in time and turn in his paper when it was originally\ndue on Friday afternoon. His lapse may be forgiven or overlooked,\nmaybe even with a Latin term invoked in the process, but none of\nthat means a break in continuity, a lapse, or an interruption never\nhappened. Seeinfra, at 10, n.\u00a02 (discussing treatment\nof a lapse under subparagraph (A)).We do not mean to suggest that every use of the\nword \u201cextension\u201d must be read the same way. On occasion, for\nexample, Congress requires \u201cextensions\u201d to be \u201cconsecutive\u201d or\n\u201csuccessive.\u201dE.g., 8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71184(g)(8)(D); 10\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72304a(f\u00a0); 19 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a72432(d)(1); 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7594(b)(3)(A). Modifiers like\nthose may well suggest a continuity requirement. See,e.g.,\nWebster\u2019s New Collegiate Dictionary, at 846 (defining \u201csuccessive\u201d\nas \u201cfollowing each other without interruption\u201d). Other contextual\nclues in a given statute may yield a similar conclusion. But none\nof that means the bare term \u201cextension\u201d obviously and always\nincludes a strict continuity requirement. If anything, the absence\nof any parallel modifying language in the statute before us\nsupplies one clue that continuity is not required here.Further statutory clues confirm this\nunderstanding. Recall that subparagraph (B)(i) authorizes small\nrefineries to seek hardship exemptions \u201cat any time.\u201d 42\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a77545(o)(9)(B)(i). Far from indicating\nthat a refinery may apply for an exemption in a future year only if\nit has always received one in the past, this language suggests a\nmuch more \u201cexpansive meaning.\u201dUnited Statesv.Gonzales,520 U.S.\n1, 5 (1997). \u201cAt any time\u201d does not connote a demand for some\nrigid continuity so much as its opposite\u2014including the possibility\nthat small refineries might apply for exemptions in different years\nin light of market fluctuations and changing hardship conditions,\nwhether consecutively or otherwise.[1]We find another feature telling too. Next door,\nsubparagraph (A) uses the term \u201cextension\u201dwithouta\ncontinuity requirement. To see how subparagraph (A) was designed,\nimagine a small refinery avails itself of the blanket exemption in\n2008 and 2009 under subparagraph (A)(i). Then in 2010, because of\nan increase in production capacity, the refinery loses \u201csmall\nrefinery\u201d status under \u00a77545(o)(1)(K) and with it the\nblanket exemption that \u201cappl[ies] to small refineries.\u201d\n\u00a77545(o)(9)(A)(i). One year later, production capacity falls\nand the refinery moves back into small refinery status for 2011. If\nthat refinery applies for an \u201cextension\u201d under subparagraph\n(A)(ii), the statute provides that EPA \u201cshall extend the exemption\nunder clause (i),\u201d so long as the Secretary of Energy found the\nrefinery would suffer a disproportionate hardship. The result? A\nrefinery may receive an \u201cextension\u201d despite its exemption having\nlapsed. And if that\u2019s how the term is used in subparagraph (A), we\nwould once again expect subparagraph (B) to follow a consistent\npattern of usage. SeeHenson, 582 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 5).[2]The refineries suggest we need to place still\nanother point in their column. They direct our attention to a\nregulation EPA adopted in 2014 to clarify the bounds of \u201csmall\nrefinery\u201d status. When EPA first sought public comment, some\nsuggested a refinery should be eligible for exemption only if itconstantlyremained \u201csmall\u201d from 2006 onward\u2014and EPA\nexpressly rejected that view in favor of revisiting annually\nwhether a refinery falls above or below the \u201csmall refinery\u201d\nthreshold. 40 CFR \u00a780.1441(e)(2)(iii). Before the Tenth Circuit,\nthe Agency insisted this regulation sheds light on the meaning of\n\u201cextension\u201d and underscores that it does not include a continuity\nrequirement. Indeed, EPA asked the court of appeals to defer to its\nunderstanding underChevron U.\u00a0S.\u00a0A. Inc.v.Natural Resources Defense Council,Inc.,467 U.S.\n837(1984). Although the refineries repeat that ask here, the\ngovernment does not. With the recent change in administrations,\n\u201cthe government is not invokingChevron.\u201d Brief for Federal\nRespondent 46\u201347. We therefore decline to consider whether any\ndeference might be due its regulation.Against the petitioners\u2019 evidence of statutory\nmeaning, the respondents ask us to consider one of their own. They\npoint to the fact that subparagraph (A) is titled \u201ctemporary\nexemption,\u201d that it was permitted to expire in 2013, and that\nsubparagraph (B)(i) speaks of extending \u201cthe exemption under\nsubparagraph (A).\u201d Together, respondents say, these statutory\nfeatures suggest that the whole scheme of exemptions was meant to\nend rapidly, that subparagraph (B)(i) was designed as a narrow\nexception to a 2013 sunset rule, and that any further exemptions it\nallows should therefore be construed narrowly to end as quickly as\npossible.But this much we do not see. In the first place,\nwe do not construe subparagraph (B) as part of some sunset scheme.\nTo be sure, subparagraph (A)\u2019s exemptions were permitted to expire\nin 2013, but did not have to do so. In theory, EPA could have\ngranted a small refinery exemption under subparagraph (A)(ii) that\nlasted many years or indefinitely. See 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n7545(o)(9)(A)(ii)(II). In any case, subparagraph (B)(i)\nexpressly contemplates exemptions beyond 2013\u2014\u201cat any time\u201d\nhardship conditions are satisfied. If Congress really had wanted\nall exemptions to cease after a temporary period, that was surely\nan odd way to achieve it. Odder still in light of the fact that\nCongress had before it (but eschewed) many readymade models for a\nsunset statute if that\u2019s what it wished here. See,e.g.,\n\u00a7247d\u20137f(b) (providing that statutory provisions authorizing a\n\u201climited antitrust exemption\u201d \u201cshall expire at the end of [a]\n17-year period\u201d after the Act was passed). And maybe odder yet\ngiven that subparagraph (B)(i) exemptions are hardly destined to\nsunset quickly even on the respondents\u2019 account, for they do not\ndispute that small refineries with an unbroken record of failing to\ncomply with the RFP may continue to seek and obtain extensions\nforever. See Brief for Federal Respondent 43, n.\u00a07; Brief for\nIndustry Respondents 39.Additionally, even assuming (without granting)\nthat subparagraph (B) really did represent only some sort of\nexception to a general 2013 deadline, we still don\u2019t see how that\nwould help. The respondents urge us to construe statutory\nexceptions narrowly. But this Court has made clear that statutory\nexceptions are to be read fairly, not narrowly, for they \u201care no\nless part of Congress\u2019s work than its rules and standards\u2014and all\nare worthy of a court\u2019s respect.\u201dBP p.l.c.v.Mayor and\nCity Council of Baltimore,ante, at 6. And fairly read,\nthe key phrase at issue before us\u2014\u201cA small refinery may at any time\npetition the Administrator for an extension of the exemption under\nsubparagraph (A) for the reason of disproportionate economic\nhardship\u201d\u2014simply does not contain the continuity requirement the\ncourt of appeals supposed. Instead, more naturally, it means\nexactly what it says: A small refinery can apply for (if not always\nreceive) a hardship extension \u201cat any time.\u201d[3]IIIEverything else the respondents offer in\ndefense of the court of appeals\u2019 judgment involves surmise about\nlegislative purpose and arguments from public policy. Like the\nTenth Circuit, they emphasize that, by the time the petitioners\nsought new exemptions in 2017 and 2018, small refineries already\n\u201chad many years to ponder .\u00a0.\u00a0. whether it made sense to\nenter into or remain in the market.\u201d 948 F.\u00a03d, at 1247. The\nrespondents argue that subparagraph (B) was adopted for the purpose\nof \u201cfunnel[ing] small refineries toward compliance over time.\u201dId., at 1246. And they submit that enforcing a continuity\nrequirement helps advance congressional goals such as increasing\n\u201cbiofuel production, energy independence, and environmental\nprotection.\u201dIbid.The dissent seemingly agrees. It acknowledges\nthat Congress providedotherameliorating provisions to\naddress various challenges to the fuel market.Post, at\n8\u201310. For example and as we have already seen,\n\u00a77545(o)(7)(A) grants EPA authority to waive RFP obligations\nat any time across an entire State or region to address severe\nhardships or shortages. Section 7545(o)(7)(E)(ii) provides a\nmore limited waiver with respect to biomass-based diesel fuels. And\n\u00a77545(o)(8)(D)(i) provided a waiver authority to address\nhardships for consumers \u201cin calendar year 2006.\u201d But on the\ndissent\u2019s view, everything else in the statute aims to\n\u201c[f]unnel[\u00a0] refineries toward compliance.\u201dPost, at 9.\nIndeed, the dissent finds it \u201codd\u201d that our reading would permit\nhardship relief only to small refineries in existence in 2008 and\nnot to new ones,post, at 13\u2014and that our reading \u201cwill\nrequire EPA to examine the 2008 study\u201d when reviewing extension\napplications \u201cdecades from now,\u201dpost, at 9.But, as usual, the other side presents a\nplausible competing narrative. On the petitioners\u2019 account, the\nstatute seeks to increase production of renewable fuel while also\noffering a \u201csafety valve\u201d each year for small refineries that might\notherwise face extinction. According to the small refineries, the\nrespondents\u2019 competing \u201cfunnel\u201d metaphor makes little sense because\na small refinery\u2019s compliance in one year is in no way dispositive\nof its ability to comply in a future year. Instead, compliance\ndepends on numerous factors unique to each year and circumstances\nover which small refineries often have no control. Brief for\nPetitioners 42\u201344. In particular, most small refineries cannot\ncomply with RFP mandates but must purchase credits from those that\ncan. Each year more credits are required. And the price for those\ncredits reflect the famously volatile nature of the fuel market\u2014in\none recent year, prices shot up by as much as 100%. Seeid.,\nat 45. Aware of these market realities, the small refineries say, a\nrational Congress could have created (and did create) a means for\nsmall refineries to seek a hardship exemption \u201cat any time\u201d rather\nthan be forced to exit the market.The petitioners say their \u201csafety valve\u201d analogy\nfits better for other reasons too. As the dissent acknowledges,\nCongress included many other \u201csafety valve\u201d provisions to address\nvarious challenges to the market that may arise at any time,\nincluding regional shortages and economic hardships.Post,\nat 8\u201310. Surely, Congress could have chosen to provide similar\nrelief targeted to small refineries. Nor is there anything odd\nabout the fact that Congress chose only to protect existing small\nrefineries rather than new entrants. Often Congress chooses to\nprotect existing market participants from shifts in the law while\napplying new restrictions fully to future entrants. Maybe, too, the\npetitioners suggest, Congress wasn\u2019t particularly concerned with\nnew entrants in 2008 because, until last year, there had not been a\nnew refinery of any size in this country for almost 50 years. See\nBlackmon, First Major U. S. Oil Refinery Since 1977 Targets Bakken\nShale Crude, Forbes (July 25, 2020),\nhttps:\u00a0//\u00a0www.forbes.com\u00a0/\u00a0sites\u00a0/\u00a0davidblackmon\u00a0/\u00a02020\u00a0/\u00a007\u00a0/\u00a025/\nfirst\u00a0-\u00a0new\u00a0-\u00a0us\u00a0-oil-refinery-since-1977-targets-bakken-shale-crude/.The petitioners stress as well that, even on the\nrespondents\u2019 account, Congress did create a \u201csafety valve\u201d rather\nthan a \u201cfunnel\u201d forsomesmall refineries: Those with an\nunbroken record of failing to comply with the RFP may continue to\nseek and obtain extensions forever without being \u201cfunneled\u201d toward\ncompliance.Supra, at 11\u201312. Yet the respondents never\nexplain why the least compliant refineries should be the most\nfavored in this way. Nor do they confront the fact that their rule\nwould have the strange effect of disincentivizing small refineries\nfrom ever trying to comply. Brief for Petitioners 22; Brief for\nState of Wyoming et\u00a0al. asAmici Curiae13\u201314. And even\non the respondents\u2019 account, EPA will have to consult its 2008\nstudy in future years for these permanently noncompliant\nrefineries.Beyond that, the petitioners note, if\nsubparagraph (B)(i) really did create a \u201cmiss one and done\u201d rule\nfor small refineries able to comply with RFP mandates in a single\nyear the statute could wind up reducing overall domestic fuel\nsupply\u2014all without adding a single additional gallon of renewable\nfuel to the mix. See 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a77545(o)(5)(B);\n40 CFR \u00a780.1427. Permanently shuttering existing small refineries\nin the process could, as well, increase the Nation\u2019s future\nreliance on imported fuels. Brief for Petitioners 41. All of which\nsits uneasily with even the respondents\u2019 account of the statute\u2019s\npurposes.We mention all this not because we pick sides.\nNeither the statute\u2019s text, structure, nor history afford us\nsufficient guidance to be able to choose with confidence between\nthe parties\u2019 competing narratives and metaphors. We mention this\nonly to observe thatbothsides can offer plausible accounts\nof legislative purpose and sound public policy\u2014and that it would\ntherefore be a mistake to rely on appeals to some abstract\nintuition that the number of small refineries receiving exemptions\n\u201cshould havetapered down\u201d over time. 948 F.\u00a03d, at\n1246 (emphasis added). Instead, our analysis can be guided only by\nthe statute\u2019s text\u2014and that nowhere commands a continuity\nrequirement.*The respondents have not shown that EPA\u2019s\napproval of the petitioners\u2019 extension requests was in excess of\nthe Agency\u2019s statutory authority. 5 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7706(2)(C).\nTo the extent the court of appeals vacated EPA\u2019s orders on this\nground, the judgment isReversed.Notes1On the dissent\u2019s account, this\nlanguage merely permits a small refinery to seek an extension for\nthe following yearafterEPA\u2019s November 30 deadline for\npublishing the coming year\u2019s RFP mandates.Post, at 10\u201311.\nBut to pursue this interpretation we would effectively have to read\nwords into the statute. A provision promising small refineries that\nthey may seek an extension \u201cat any time\u201d would become a provision\npromising them only the chance to seek an extension \u201cfor the\nfollowing yearat any timebefore or after EPA\u2019s November 30\ndeadline for publishing next year\u2019s RFP mandates.\u201d2Replying to our example, the\ndissent posits that subparagraph (A)(i)\u2019s exemption \u201cexisted in the\nyear 2010 by virtue of statute\u2014even if a particular refinery was\nnot in a position to take advantage of it.\u201dPost, at 12. But\nit\u2019s hard to see how a refinery might have an \u201cexemption[\u00a0]\ncurrently in place\u201d when it does not qualify for or receive its\nbenefits.Post, at 1. Even putting that problem aside,\nfollowing the dissent\u2019s logic does not aid its cause. What is true\nfor subparagraph (A)(i) should likewise be true for subparagraph\n(B)(i), which refers to \u201cthe exemption under subparagraph (A).\u201d So,\nfollowing the dissent\u2019s reasoning, one might just as easily\nconceive of a subparagraph (B)(i) exemption as \u201cexisting\u201d even in a\nyear when a small refinery \u201cwas not in a position to take advantage\nof it.\u201d Accordingly, on the dissent\u2019s logic, if a small refinery\nlacked the exemption in one year (say, 2016) and then applied for\nit in a later year (say, 2017), it would seem the exemption always\n\u201cpresently exist[ed]\u201d and can be \u201cextended.\u201dPost, at 4,\n8.3Rather than argue subparagraph\n(B)(i) is an exception that should be construed narrowly, the\ndissent imagines some weakness in our position when we observe\nabove that the word extension \u201ccan\u201d or \u201cmay\u201d be used to refer to an\nincrease in time after a lapse.Supra, at 6. From this, the\ndissent supposes that we mean to say \u201cHollyFrontier wins because\nits reading is [merely]possible.\u201dPost, at 3. That\nis mistaken. As we have sought to explain, we simply recognize that\nthe term \u201cextension\u201d may or may not convey a continuity requirement\ndepending on context\u2014much as the dissent acknowledges the term can\nsometimes tolerate a lapse of some sort. Seesupra,at 10,\nn.\u00a02 (discussing subparagraph (A)(1)). Our holding today, too,\nshould be clear. Rather than rule for HollyFrontier because it has\nadvanced a permissible reading, and rather than offer assertions\nabout \u201ccommon sense\u201d or what seems \u201cmore natural\u201d to us,post, at 3\u20135, we have sought to explain why this particular\nstatute\u2019s usage, context, and structure persuade us that continuity\nis not required here.",
