SALINAS, PETITIONERv.UNITED STATES RAILROAD RETIREMENT BOARDon writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the fifth circuit[February 3, 2021]Justice Sotomayor delivered the opinion of the\nCourt.The Railroad Retirement Act of 1974 (RRA),\n50Stat. 307, as restated and amended, 45 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7231et\u00a0seq., establishes a system of disability,\nretirement, and survivor benefits for railroad employees. That\nsystem is administered by the U.\u00a0S. Railroad Retirement Board\n(Board). The Board denied benefits to petitioner Manfredo M.\nSalinas, a former railroad employee, when he applied in 2006, but\nit later granted him benefits when he reapplied in 2013. Salinas\nthen requested that the Board reopen its decision to deny his 2006\napplication, but the Board declined. This case asks whether the\nBoard\u2019s refusal to reopen the prior denial of benefits is subject\nto judicial review. The Court holds that it is.IAThe RRA provides long-term benefits to\nrailroad employees who have accrued enough years of service and who\nhave either reached a certain age or become disabled. See 45\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a7231a(a)(1), (b). It also provides benefits for\neligible employees\u2019 spouses and survivors under certain conditions.\n\u00a7\u00a7231a(c)\u2013(d). These benefits complement those provided by another\nstatute, the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act (RUIA), 52Stat.\n1094, 45 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7351et seq., which covers\nshort-term periods of unemployment and sickness. See \u00a7352. This\ncase concerns benefits under the RRA only. Both statutes, however,\nare relevant, as discussed below.To administer benefits under the RRA, the Board\nhas implemented a multistep system of administrative review. First,\nan individual applies for benefits and receives an initial decision\nfrom the appropriate division of the Board, such as the Disability\nBenefits Division. 20 CFR \u00a7260.1(a) (2020). If the individual is\ndissatisfied, she may seek reconsideration from the Board\u2019s\nReconsideration Section. \u00a7260.3(a). If denied again, she may appeal\nto the Board\u2019s Bureau of Hearings and Appeals (Bureau). \u00a7260.5(a).\nLastly, the applicant may take a final appeal to the Board itself.\n\u00a7260.9(a).This four-step sequence is the primary form of\nadministrative review for benefits determinations. Applicants have\na right to seek each of the above levels of review within 60 days.\nSee,e.g.,45 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7231f(b)(3); 20 CFR\n\u00a7260.9(b). Once an applicant completes the review process, or the\ndeadline for seeking further review passes, the benefits\ndetermination becomes \u201cfinal\u201d under the Board\u2019s regulations. See 20\nCFR \u00a7261.1(b).After a determination becomes final, an\napplicant can request that the Board reopen it. See \u00a7261.1(a).\n\u201cReopening .\u00a0.\u00a0. means a conscious determination on the\npart of the agency to reconsider an otherwise final decision for\npurposes of revising that decision.\u201d \u00a7261.1(c) (emphasis deleted).\nWhether to grant reopening is ultimately discretionary. See\n\u00a7261.11. The Board, however, has established substantive criteria\nto guide its discretion. For example, as relevant here, a decision\nmay be reopened \u201c[w]ithin four years of the date of the notice of\nsuch decision, if there is new and material evidence.\u201d\n\u00a7261.2(b).BSalinas is a former carpenter and assistant\nforeman for the Union Pacific Railroad. During his 15-year railroad\ncareer, he suffered two serious injuries on the job. In 1989, a\nco-worker dropped a sledge hammer from an overhead bridge, hitting\nSalinas on the top of his hardhat. Then, in 1993, a wooden railroad\ntie fell from a truck and struck Salinas in the head. As a result,\nSalinas underwent two spinal fusion surgeries. After receiving\ntreatment, Salinas continued to experience pain, anxiety, and\ndepression. He began seeking RRA disability benefits in 1992. His\nfirst two applications were denied, and he did not seek\nreconsideration of either.On February 28, 2006, Salinas filed his third\napplication for RRA benefits. The Board denied Salinas\u2019 application\non August 28, 2006, concluding that his impairments were not severe\nenough to qualify for relief. After missing the deadline for\nseeking reconsideration, Salinas sent a letter to the Board\nrequesting that it reconsider its decision \u201ceven though the 60 days\nhad passed.\u201d Record 207. Salinas noted, among other things, that he\nhad \u201cmore medical records to provide.\u201dIbid.The\nReconsideration Section denied Salinas\u2019 request, finding that he\nhad failed to demonstrate good cause for his late filing. See 20\nCFR \u00a7260.3(c). Salinas did not appeal.Seven years later, on December 26, 2013, Salinas\nfiled his fourth application for RRA benefits. This time, his\napplication was granted. Although Salinas was deemed disabled as of\nOctober 9, 2010, his benefits began on December 1, 2012, 12 months\nprior to the date on which he filed his successful application.\nUnder the RRA, disability benefits begin on the latest of several\nalternative start dates, and Salinas\u2019 application-based start date\nwas later than his disability onset date. See Record 8; 45\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7231d(a)(ii); 20 CFR \u00a7218.9(c).Salinas timely sought reconsideration of the\namount and start date of his benefits. The Reconsideration Section\ndenied relief, and Salinas appealed to the Bureau. On appeal,\nSalinas argued that his 2006 application should be reopened because\nthe Board had not considered certain medical records in existence\nat the time when it denied him benefits. Salinas submitted the\nrecords as part of his appeal.On August 26, 2016, the Bureau denied Salinas\u2019\nrequest to reopen the 2006 decision. The Bureau concluded that\nSalinas had failed to seek reopening based on \u201cnew and material\nevidence\u201d within four years of the decision at issue, as required\nby regulation. 20 CFR \u00a7261.2(b). Salinas appealed to the Board,\nwhich affirmed the Bureau\u2019s decision on the ground that Salinas had\nnot met the criteria for reopening under \u00a7261.2. The Board notified\nSalinas that he could seek judicial review of the Board\u2019s decision\nwithin one year.Salinas filed a timelypro\u00a0sepetition for review with the United States Court of Appeals for the\nFifth Circuit. The Fifth Circuit dismissed the petition for lack of\njurisdiction. 765 Fed. Appx. 79, 80\u201381 (2019)\n(per\u00a0curiam). In a previous decision, the Fifth Circuit\nhad joined the majority of Circuits in holding that federal courts\ncannot review the Board\u2019s refusal to reopen a prior benefits\ndetermination. SeeRobertsv.Railroad Retirement\nBd.,346 F.3d 139, 141 (2003). The Fifth Circuit noted a\nlongstanding split among the Circuits on this issue. 765 Fed.\nAppx., at 80\u201381 (citing cases).We granted certiorari to resolve the conflict\namong the Courts of Appeals. 589 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2020).IISection 231g of the RRA provides that, except\nfor the deadline for seeking review, \u201c[d]ecisions of the Board\ndetermining the rights or liabilities of any person\u201d under the RRA\n\u201cshall be subject to judicial review in the same manner, subject to\nthe same limitations, and all provisions of law shall apply in the\nsame manner as though the decision were a determination of\ncorresponding rights or liabilities under the Railroad Unemployment\nInsurance Act.\u201d 45 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7231g. In other words, \u00a7231g\nmakes judicial review available under the RRA to the same extent\nthat review is available under the RUIA.[1] This case, therefore, turns on the RUIA\u2019s judicial\nreview provision, 45 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7355(f\u00a0).Section 355(f\u00a0) provides: \u201cAny claimant, or\nany railway labor organization organized in accordance with the\nprovisions of the Railway Labor Act . . . , of which claimant is a\nmember, or any base-year employer of the claimant, or any other\nparty aggrieved by a final decision under subsection (c) of this\nsection, may .\u00a0.\u00a0. obtain a review of any final decision\nof the Board.\u201d[2] To qualify\nfor judicial review under this provision, the Board\u2019s refusal to\nreopen its denial of Salinas\u2019 2006 application must constitute \u201cany\nfinal decision of the Board.\u201d It does.AThe text of \u00a7355(f\u00a0) starts our analysis.\nThe phrase \u201cany final decision\u201d is broad, and it reflects Congress\u2019\nintent to define the scope of review \u201cexpansively.\u201dSmithv.Berryhill, 587 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2019) (slip op., at 6)\n(internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). The phrase\n\u201cdenotes some kind of terminal event,\u201d such as the \u201cfinal stage of\nreview.\u201dId.,at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 6\u20137). Similar\nlanguage in the Administrative Procedure Act has been interpreted\nto refer to an agency action that \u201cboth (1) mark[s] the\nconsummation of the agency\u2019s decisionmaking process and (2) is one\nby which rights or obligations have been determined, or from which\nlegal consequences will flow.\u201dId., at ___ (slip op., at 9)\n(quotingBennettv.Spear,520\nU.S. 154, 177\u2013178 (1997); internal quotation marks\nomitted).The Board\u2019s refusal to reopen the prior denial\nof benefits satisfies these criteria. First, the decision was the\n\u201cterminal event\u201d in the Board\u2019s administrative review process.Smith, 587 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 6). After first\nrequesting reopening before the Bureau, Salinas exhausted further\nagency review by appealing to the Board itself. Salinas\u2019 only\nrecourse thereafter was to seek judicial review.Second, the Board\u2019s decision was one \u201c\u00a0\u2018by\nwhich rights or obligations have been determined, or from which\nlegal consequences will flow.\u2019\u00a0\u201dArmy Corps of\nEngineersv.Hawkes Co., 578 U.S. 590, 597 (2016). The\nBoard has defined reopening as \u201ca conscious determination\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. to reconsider an otherwise final decision for\npurposes of revising that decision.\u201d 20 CFR \u00a7261.1(c). Reopening\ntherefore entails substantive changes that affect benefits and\nobligations under the RRA. Consistent with its substantive nature,\nthe decision to grant or deny reopening is guided by objective\ncriteria, including whether \u201cthere is new and material evidence or\nthere was adjudicative error not consistent with the evidence of\nrecord at the time of adjudication.\u201d \u00a7261.2(b). If reopening is\ngranted, any revision the Board makes may be reviewed in the same\nmanner as a primary determination of benefits; otherwise, the\nrevision is \u201cbinding.\u201d \u00a7\u00a7261.7, 261.8. In light of these features,\na decision about reopening fits within the meaning of \u201cany final\ndecision\u201d as that phrase is used in \u00a7355(f\u00a0).The Board disagrees because it interprets the\nphrase \u201cany final decision\u201d to mean \u201cany final decision under\n\u00a7355(c).\u201d The Board\u2019s argument goes like this: Section 355(f\u00a0)\nauthorizes four parties to seek judicial review: (1) a claimant for\nbenefits, (2) a claimant\u2019s railway labor organization, (3) a\nclaimant\u2019s base-year employer, and (4) \u201cany other party aggrieved\nby a final decision under subsection (c) of this section.\u201d 45\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7355(f\u00a0). The phrase \u201cany other\u201d means\nthat, in order to obtain judicial review, each of the enumerated\nparties must be \u201caggrieved by a final decision under subsection\n(c).\u201d This implies, in turn, that each party may seek judicial\nreview of only the decision \u201cunder subsection (c)\u201d by which it was\naggrieved. A denial of reopening is not a decision \u201cunder\nsubsection (c)\u201d because it is not a determination granting or\ndenying benefits. See \u00a7\u00a7355(c)(1)\u2013(4). Thus, the Board argues,\nreopening decisions are not subject to judicial review.The Board\u2019s interpretation is inconsistent with\nthe text of \u00a7355(f\u00a0). Congress conspicuously chose the broad\nlanguage \u201cany final decision,\u201d without tying that phrase to the\nearlier reference to \u201ca final decision under subsection (c).\u201d This\nomission is especially notable because Congress used such limiting\nreferences elsewhere in \u00a7355. Under \u00a7355(c)(5), Congress\nestablished rules for \u201c[f]inal decision[s] of the Board in the\ncases provided for in the preceding three paragraphs\u201d (in other\nwords, under \u00a7\u00a7355(c)(2)\u2013(4)). 45 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7355(c)(5). In\nthe same paragraph, Congress authorized any properly interested and\nnotified party to obtain judicial review of \u201cany such decision by\nwhich he claims to be aggrieved.\u201d 45 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7355(c)(5).\nBy using the language \u201csuch\u201d and \u201cby which he claims to be\naggrieved,\u201d Congress clearly referred to the particular type of\ndecision described earlier in \u00a7355(c)(5), thus limiting judicial\nreview to final decisions \u201cprovided for\u201d in \u00a7\u00a7355(c)(2)\u2013(4).This type of limiting language is absent from\n\u00a7355(f\u00a0). \u201cWhere Congress includes particular language in one\nsection of a statute but omits it in another section of the same\nAct, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and\npurposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.\u201dRussellov.United States,464 U.S.\n16, 23 (1983) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).\nSection 355(f\u00a0) authorizes judicial review of \u201cany\u201d final\ndecision, not \u201csuch\u201d final decision \u201cunder subsection (c).\u201d The\nBoard\u2019s denial of reopening qualifies for review under the language\nCongress chose.[3]BTo the extent there is ambiguity in the\nmeaning of \u201cany final decision,\u201d it must be resolved in Salinas\u2019\nfavor under the \u201cstrong presumption favoring judicial review of\nadministrative action.\u201dMach Mining, LLCv.EEOC, 575\nU.S. 480, 486 (2015) (internal quotation marks omitted). This\ndefault rule is \u201c\u00a0\u2018well-settled,\u2019\u00a0\u201d and Congress is\npresumed to legislate with it in mind.Kucanav.Holder,558 U.S.\n233, 252 (2010). To rebut the presumption, the Board bears a\n\u201cheavy burden\u201d of showing that the statute\u2019s \u201clanguage or\nstructure\u201d forecloses judicial review.Mach Mining, 575\nU.\u00a0S., at 486 (internal quotation marks omitted).The Board has not met its burden. The Board\nargues that various cross-references within \u00a7355 indicate that\n\u00a7355(f\u00a0) covers only decisions made under \u00a7355(c). For\ninstance, \u00a7355(c)(7) provides for review solely \u201cpursuant to this\nsubsection and subsection (f\u00a0).\u201d 45 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7355(c)(7); see also \u00a7355(c)(5). Meanwhile, \u00a7355(f\u00a0) requires\nthat \u201call administrative remedies within the Board,\u201d including\nreview under \u00a7355(c), must be exhausted before a party can seek\njudicial review. Finally, \u00a7355(g) provides that \u201c[f]indings of fact\nand conclusions of law of the Board in the determination of any\nclaim for benefits or refund\u201d and \u201cthe determination of any other\nmatter pursuant to subsection (c)\u201d shall be reviewed exclusively\nunder \u00a7355(f\u00a0). In the Board\u2019s view, these cross-references\nprove that \u00a7\u00a7355(f\u00a0) and 355(c) are coextensive.The structure of \u00a7355 shows that \u00a7355(c) feeds\nexclusively into \u00a7355(f\u00a0), but nothing in the statute suggests\nthat the exclusivity runs the other way. To the contrary, several\nclues indicate that \u00a7355(f\u00a0) encompasses decisions beyond\nthose described in \u00a7355(c). For example, \u00a7355(g) lists three types\nof decisions that are subject to review exclusively under\n\u00a7355(f\u00a0): determinations of claims for benefits or refunds,\ndeterminations of other matters under \u00a7355(c), and determinations\nthat unexpended funds in the railroad unemployment insurance\naccount may be used to pay benefits or refunds. See 45\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a7355(g), 351(p), 360(a). The Board concedes\nthat the third type of decision falls outside \u00a7355(c). See Brief\nfor Respondent 22, n.\u00a04.[4] In addition, the Board\u2019s own regulations appear to\npresume that judicial review is available for decisions not covered\nby \u00a7355(c), such as the Board\u2019s determinations of employers\u2019\ncontribution rates. See 20 CFR \u00a7345.307(c). Given these indications\nthat \u00a7355(f\u00a0) is broader than \u00a7355(c), the Board\u2019s structural\nargument does not overcome the plain meaning of \u201cany final\ndecision\u201d and the presumption in favor of judicial review.CThe Board\u2019s remaining arguments also fall\nshort. First, the Board argues that this Court\u2019s precedent holds\nthat reopening decisions are not subject to judicial review. InCalifanov.Sanders,430 U.S.\n99(1977), this Court concluded that \u00a7405(g) of the Social\nSecurity Act, which authorizes judicial review of \u201c\u00a0\u2018any final\ndecision of the Secretary made after a hearing,\u2019\u00a0\u201d does not\napply to refusals to reopen a prior benefits determination.Id.,at 102 (quoting 42 U.\u00a0S. C. \u00a7405(g)). As it is\nunder the RRA, the opportunity to seek reopening inCalifanowas \u201ca second look that the agency had made available to claimants\nas a matter of grace\u201d after the deadline for appealing an initial\nbenefits determination had passed.Smith, 587 U.\u00a0S., at\n___ (slip op., at 12). Given this similarity, many courts have\nappliedCalifanoto the type of decision at issue here. See,e.g.,Roberts, 346 F.\u00a03d, at 141;Harrisv.Railroad Retirement Bd.,198 F.3d 139, 142 (CA4 1999);Abbruzzesev.Railroad\nRetirement Bd.,63 F.3d 972,974(CA10 1995).A key textual difference in the respective\njudicial review provisions, however, distinguishesCalifanofrom this case. Section 405(g) of the Social Security Act provides\nthat reviewable decisions must be \u201cmade after a hearing,\u201d whereas\n\u00a7355(f\u00a0) of the RRA contains no such limitation. Compare 42\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7405(g) with 45 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7355(f\u00a0). Section 405(g)\u2019s hearing requirement was a\nsignificant basis forCalifano\u2019s conclusion that judicial\nreview was unavailable, as \u201ca petition to reopen a prior final\ndecision may be denied without a hearing.\u201d 430 U.\u00a0S., at 108;\nsee alsoibid.(explaining that \u00a7405(g) \u201cclearly limits\njudicial review to a particular type of agency action\u201d). The other\nconsiderations identified inCalifano, including the fact\nthat reopening was made available only by regulation, corroborated\nthe Court\u2019s interpretation of this important textual limit.Ibid.; see alsoSmith, 587 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 8). Section 355(f\u00a0), by contrast, contains no such\nexpress limitation, and the Board\u2019s decision fits within the\nprovision\u2019s plain language.Second, the Board argues that \u00a7355(f\u00a0)\nshould be interpreted in light of \u00a7231g\u2019s reference to decisions\n\u201cdetermining the rights or liabilities of any person.\u201d See 45\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7231g. The denial of reopening does not qualify\nfor judicial review, the Board claims, because it is simply a\n\u201crefusal to make a new determination\u201d of rights or liabilities,\nlike the decision this Court addressed inYour Home Visiting\nNurse Services, Inc.v.Shalala,525\nU.S. 449(1999).Id.,at 453 (emphasis deleted). InYour Home, this Court concluded that an agency\nintermediary\u2019s refusal to reopen a prior Medicare reimbursement\ndetermination was not subject to further administrative review\nbecause it was not a \u201c\u00a0\u2018final determination .\u00a0.\u00a0. as\nto the amount of total program reimbursement due.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIbid. (quoting 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a71395oo(a)(1)(A)(i)). The agency argued that the denial of\nreopening was not itself a determination \u201cas to the amount,\u201d but\nrather a refusal to make such a determination.Ibid.This\nCourt concluded that the agency\u2019s interpretation was reasonable,\nand thus entitled to deference underChevron U.\u00a0S.\u00a0A.\nInc.v.Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,467 U.S.\n837(1984).Your Home, 525 U.\u00a0S., at 453. The Court\nnoted that the agency\u2019s interpretation was also \u201cthe more natural\u201d\nreading of the statute and was \u201cfurther confirmed\u201d by two\nconsiderations fromCalifano: The right to seek reopening\nexisted only by regulation, and permitting review would undermine\nthe ordinary deadlines for appealing the intermediary\u2019s\nreimbursement decisions. 525 U.\u00a0S., at 453\u2013454. The Board\nargues that its decision here should be viewed in the same way.The Board\u2019s argument is unpersuasive for several\nreasons. First, the statute inYour Homedefined the scope\nof internal agency review and thus did not implicate the\npresumption in favor of judicial review. To the contrary, the Court\nultimately deferred to the agency\u2019s interpretation precluding\nreview underChevron. See 525 U.\u00a0S., at 453. No such\ndeference is due here because the scope of judicial review is\n\u201chardly the kind of question that the Court presumes that Congress\nimplicitly delegated to an agency.\u201dSmith, 587 U.\u00a0S.,\nat ___ (slip op., at 14).Second, the statute at issue inYour Homewas narrower than \u00a7231g because it focused on a particular type of\ndetermination: one \u201cas to the amount of total program reimbursement\ndue the provider.\u201d See 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a71395oo(a)(1)(A)(i). Section 231g, in contrast, broadly\nauthorizes judicial review of \u201c[d]ecisions .\u00a0.\u00a0.\ndetermining the rights or liabilities of any person under [the\nRRA].\u201d This broader language, as well as \u00a7231g\u2019s express direction\nthat \u201call provisions of law shall apply in the same manner as\nthough the decision were a determination of corresponding rights or\nliabilities under the [RUIA],\u201d indicates that \u00a7231g simply\nincorporates \u00a7355(f\u00a0) into the RRA. As the Board stated during\noral argument, \u00a7231g \u201ceffectively piggybacks\u201d on \u00a7355(f\u00a0). Tr.\nof Oral Arg. 46. Every Court of Appeals to interpret these statutes\nhas reached the same conclusion. Seesupra,at 5, n.\u00a01.\nThus, the key language governing judicial review under both\nstatutes is the phrase \u201cany final decision.\u201dFinally, the Board argues that the opportunity\nto seek reopening is a matter of administrative grace, and such\nsolicitous discretion should not be discouraged by allowing\njudicial review. But the fact that the Board could decline to offer\nreopening does not mean that, having chosen to provide it, the\nBoard may avoid the plain text of \u00a7355(f\u00a0). SeeHawkes\nCo., 578 U.\u00a0S., at 602 (\u201c[S]uch a \u2018count your blessings\u2019\nargument is not an adequate rejoinder to the assertion of a right\nto judicial review\u201d). Whether the availability of judicial review\nwill affect how the Board exercises its discretion is a question\nproperly reserved for Congress.It is also worth noting that judicial review of\nreopening decisions will be limited. The Board\u2019s decision to grant\nor deny reopening, while guided by substantive criteria, is\nultimately discretionary and therefore subject to reversal only for\nabuse of discretion. See 20 CFR \u00a7261.11;Stovic, 826\nF.\u00a03d, at 506;Szostakv.Railroad Retirement\nBd., 370 F.2d 253, 254 (CA2 1966) (Friendly, J., for the\ncourt). Most decisions will be upheld under this deferential\nstandard. SeeICCv.Locomotive Engineers,482 U.S.\n270, 288 (1987) (Stevens, J., concurring). Judicial review\nplays a modest, but important, role in guarding against decisions\nthat are arbitrary, inconsistent with the standards set by the\nBoard\u2019s own regulations, or otherwise contrary to law.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*We hold that the Board\u2019s refusal to reopen a\nprior benefits determination is a \u201cfinal decision\u201d within the\nmeaning of \u00a7355(f\u00a0), and therefore subject to judicial review.\nThe judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth\nCircuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.Notes1Every Court of Appeals to\ninterpret these statutes has reached the same conclusion.

It addresses\ndecisions awarding or denying benefits, including \u201cinitial\ndetermination[s],\u201d as well as decisions about the recovery of\nimproperly awarded benefits. 45 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7\u00a7355(c)(1)\u2013(4).3The Court need not\nresolve the parties\u2019 dispute about whether each type of party\nlisted in \u00a7355(f\u00a0) must be \u201caggrieved by a final decision\nunder subsection (c),\u201d or whether that phrase modifies only the\nclosest antecedent. Either way, Salinas is a proper party because\nhe qualifies as both a \u201cclaimant\u201d and a \u201cclaimant .\u00a0.\u00a0.\naggrieved by a final decision under subsection (c).\u201d Salinas has\nfiled four separate applications for benefits under the RRA, and he\nclaims to have been aggrieved by the Board\u2019s decision on each,\nincluding the Board\u2019s allegedly incorrect assessment of the\nbenefits he is owed based on his 2013 application.4The Board argues that\n\u00a7355(g) merely precludes review of the Board\u2019s fund decisions by\nthe Comptroller General, who ordinarily makes determinations\nrelated to the charging and settling of government accounts. See\nBrief for Respondent 22, n.\u00a04. That purpose, however, could\nhave been accomplished without also indicating that review is\navailable \u201cas provided in subsection (f\u00a0).\u201d 45\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7355(g). Indeed, the RUIA does exactly this with\nrespect to determinations about the use of funds from an\nadministrative expense account. See \u00a7361(c) (providing simply that\nthe Board\u2019s determinations \u201cshall not be subject to review in any\nmanner\u201d). Ultimately, we need not resolve whether the Board\u2019s fund\ndecisions are subject to judicial review. The point is that the\nBoard\u2019s structural interpretation is subject to doubt, and\ntherefore does not overcome the presumption in favor of judicial\nreview.",
