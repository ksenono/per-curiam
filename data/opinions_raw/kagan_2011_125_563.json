S. ____ (2011)SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESNOS. 09-987 AND 09-991ARIZONA CHRISTIAN SCHOOL TUITION ORGANIZA- TION,\nPETITIONER09\u2013987v.KATHLEEN M. WINN et\u00a0al.GALE GARRIOTT, DIRECTOR, ARIZONA DEPART- MENT\nOF REVENUE, PETITIONER09\u2013991\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0v.KATHLEEN M. WINN et\u00a0al.on writs of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the ninth circuit[April 4, 2011]Justice Kagan, with whom\nJustice Ginsburg, Justice Breyer, and Justice Sotomayor join,\ndissenting.Since its inception, the Arizona\nprivate-school-tuition tax credit has cost the State, by its own\nestimate, nearly $350 million in diverted tax revenue. The Arizona\ntaxpayers who instituted this suit (collectively, Plaintiffs)\nallege that the use of these funds to subsidize school tuition\norganizations (STOs) breaches the Establishment Clause\u2019s promise of\nreligious neutrality. Many of these STOs, the Plaintiffs claim,\ndiscriminate on the basis of a child\u2019s religion when awarding\nscholarships.For almost half a century, litigants like the\nPlaintiffs have obtained judicial review of claims that the\ngovernment has used its taxing and spending power in violation of\nthe Establishment Clause. Beginning inFlastv.Cohen,392\nU. S. 83(1968), and continuing in case after case for over\nfour decades, this Court and others have exercised jurisdiction to\ndecide taxpayer-initiated challenges not materially different from\nthis one. Not every suit has succeeded on the merits, or should\nhave. But every taxpayer-plaintiff has had her day in court to\ncontest the government\u2019s financing of religious activity.Today, the Court breaks from this precedent by\nrefusing to hear taxpayers\u2019 claims that the government has\nunconstitutionally subsidized religion through its tax system.\nThese litigants lack standing, the majority holds, because the\nfunding of religion they challenge comes from a tax credit, rather\nthan an appropriation. A tax credit, the Court asserts, does not\ninjure objecting taxpayers, because it \u201cdoes not extract and spend\n[their] funds in service of an establishment.\u201dAnte, at 15\n(internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).This novel distinction in standing law between\nappropriations and tax expenditures has as little basis in\nprinciple as it has in our precedent. Cash grants and targeted tax\nbreaks are means of accomplishing the same government objective\u2014to\nprovide financial support to select individuals or organizations.\nTaxpayers who oppose state aid of religion have equal reason to\nprotest whether that aid flows from the one form of subsidy or the\nother. Either way, the government has financed the religious\nactivity. And so either way, taxpayers should be able to challenge\nthe subsidy.Still worse, the Court\u2019s arbitrary distinction\nthreatens to eliminatealloccasions for a taxpayer to\ncontest the government\u2019s monetary support of religion. Precisely\nbecause appropriations and tax breaks can achieve identical\nobjectives, the government can easily substitute one for the other.\nToday\u2019s opinion thus enables the government to end-runFlast\u2019s guarantee of access to the Judiciary. From now on,\nthe government need follow just one simple rule\u2014subsidize through\nthe tax system\u2014to preclude taxpayer challenges to state funding of\nreligion.And that result\u2014the effective demise of\ntaxpayer standing\u2014will diminish the Establishment Clause\u2019s force\nand meaning. Sometimes, no one other than taxpayers has suffered\nthe injury necessary to challenge government sponsorship of\nreligion. Today\u2019s holding therefore will prevent federal courts\nfrom determining whether some subsidies to sectarian organizations\ncomport with our Constitution\u2019s guarantee of religious neutrality.\nBecause I believe these challenges warrant consideration on the\nmerits, I respectfully dissent from the Court\u2019s decision.IAs the majority recounts, this\nCourt has held that paying taxes usually does not give an\nindividual Article III standing to challenge government action.Ante, at 6\u201310. Taxpayers cannot demonstrate the requisite\ninjury because each person\u2019s \u201cinterest in the moneys of the\nTreasury \u2026 is comparatively minute and indeterminable.\u201dFrothinghamv.Mellon,262 U. S. 447, 487\n(1923) (decided withMassachusettsv.Mellon).\nGiven the size and complexity of government budgets, it is a\n\u201cfiction\u201d to contend that an unlawful expenditure causes an\nindividual \u201cany measurable economic harm.\u201dHeinv.Freedom From Religion Foundation, Inc.,551 U. S. 587, 593\n(2007) (plurality opinion). Nor can taxpayers in the ordinary case\nestablish causation (i.e.,that the disputed government\nmeasure affects their tax burden) or redressability (i.e.,that a judicial remedy would result in tax reductions).Ante, at 8\u20139. On these points, all agree.The disagreement concerns their\nrelevance here. This case is not about the general prohibition on\ntaxpayer standing, and cannot be resolved on that basis. This case\nis instead about the exception to the rule\u2014the principle\nestablished decades ago inFlastthat taxpayersmaychallenge certain government actions alleged to\nviolate the Establishment Clause. The Plaintiffs have standing if\ntheir suit meetsFlast\u2019s requirements\u2014and it does so under\nany fair reading of that decision.Taxpayers have standing,Flastheld,\nwhen they allege that a statute enacted pursuant to the\nlegislature\u2019s taxing and spending power violates the Establishment\nClause. 392 U. S., at 105\u2013106. In this situation, the Court\nexplained, a plaintiff can establish a two-part nexus \u201cbetween the\n[taxpayer] status asserted and the claim sought to be adjudicated.\u201dId.,at 102. First, by challenging legislative action\ntaken under the taxing and spending clause, the taxpayer shows \u201ca\nlogical link between [her] status and the type of \u2026 enactment\nattacked.\u201dIbid.Second, by invoking the Establishment\nClause\u2014a specific limitation on the legislature\u2019s taxing and\nspending power\u2014the taxpayer demonstrates \u201ca nexus between [her]\nstatus and the precise nature of the constitutional infringement\nalleged.\u201dIbid.Because of these connections,Flastheld, taxpayers alleging that the government is\nusing tax proceeds to aid religion have \u201cthe necessary stake \u2026 in\nthe outcome of the litigation to satisfy Article III.\u201dIbid.They are \u201cproper and appropriate part[ies]\u201d\u2014indeed,\noften the only possible parties\u2014to seek judicial enforcement of the\nConstitution\u2019s guarantee of religious neutrality.Ibid.That simple restatement of theFlaststandard should be enough to establish that the Plaintiffs have\nstanding. They attack a provision of the Arizona tax code that the\nlegislature enacted pursuant to the State Constitution\u2019s taxing and\nspending clause (Flastnexus, part 1). And they allege\nthat this provision violates the Establishment Clause\n(Flastnexus, part 2). By satisfying both ofFlast\u2019s conditions, the Plaintiffs have demonstrated their\n\u201cstake as taxpayers\u201d in enforcing constitutional restraints on the\nprovision of aid to STOs.Ibid.Indeed, the connection in\nthis case between \u201cthe [taxpayer] status asserted and the claim\nsought to be adjudicated,\u201dibid.,could not be any\ntighter: As noted when this Court previously addressed a different\nissue in this lawsuit, the Plaintiffs invoke the Establishment\nClause to challenge \u201can integral part of the State\u2019staxstatute\u201d that \u201cis reflected on statetaxforms\u201d and that\n\u201cis part of the calculus necessary to determinetaxliability.\u201dHibbsv.Winn,542 U. S. 88, 119 (2004)(Winn I)(Kennedy, J., dissenting) (emphasis added).\nFinding standing here is merely a matter of applyingFlast. I would therefore affirm the Court of Appeals\u2019\ndetermination (not questioned even by the eight judges who called\nfor rehearing en banc on the merits) that the Plaintiffs can pursue\ntheir claim in federal court.IIThe majority reaches a contrary\ndecision by distinguishing between two methods of financing\nreligion: A taxpayer has standing to challenge state subsidies to\nreligion, the Court announces, when the mechanism used is an\nappropriation, but not when the mechanism is a targeted tax break,\notherwise called a \u201ctax expenditure.\u201d[Footnote 1] In the former case, but not in the latter, the\nCourt declares, the taxpayer suffers cognizable injury.Ante, at 14\u201315.But this distinction finds no\nsupport in case law, and just as little in reason. In the decades\nsinceFlast, no court\u2014not one\u2014has differentiated between\nappropriations and tax expenditures in deciding whether litigants\nhave standing. Over and over again, courts (including this one)\nhave faced Establishment Clause challenges to tax credits,\ndeductions, and exemptions; over and over again, these courts have\nreached the merits of these claims. And that is for a simple\nreason: Taxpayers experience the same injury for standing purposes\nwhether government subsidization of religion takes the form of a\ncash grant or a tax measure. The only rationale the majority offers\nfor its newfound distinction\u2014that grants, but not tax expenditures,\nsomehow come from a complaining taxpayer\u2019s own wallet\u2014cannot bear\nthe weight the Court places on it. IfFlastis still good\nlaw\u2014and the majority today says nothing to the contrary\u2014then the\nPlaintiffs should be able to pursue their claim on the merits.AUntil today, this Court has never\nso much as hinted that litigants in the same shoes as the\nPlaintiffs lack standing underFlast. To the contrary: We\nhave faced the identical situation five times\u2014including in a prior\nincarnation of this very case!\u2014and we have five times resolved the\nsuit without questioning the plaintiffs\u2019 standing. Lower federal\ncourts have followed our example and handled the matter in the same\nway. I count 14 separate cases (involving 20 appellate and district\ncourts) that adjudicated taxpayer challenges to tax expenditures\nalleged to violate the Establishment Clause.[Footnote 2] I suspect I have missed a few. I have\nnot found any instance of a court dismissing such a claim for lack\nof standing.Consider the five cases in which\nthis Court entertained suits filed by taxpayers alleging that tax\nexpenditures unlawfully subsidized religion. We first took up such\na challenge inWalzv.Tax Comm\u2019n of City of New\nYork,397 U. S.\n664, 666\u2013667 (1970), where we upheld the constitutionality of a\nproperty tax exemption for religious organizations. Next, inHuntv.McNair,413 U. S. 734, 735\u2013736,\n738\u2013739 (1973), we decided that the Establishment Clause permitted\na state agency to issue tax-exempt bonds to sectarian institutions.\nThe same day, inCommittee for Public Ed. & Religious\nLibertyv.Nyquist,413 U. S. 756, 789\u2013794\n(1973), we struck down a state tax deduction for parents who paid\ntuition at religious and other private schools. A decade later, inMuellerv.Allen,463 U. S. 388, 390\u2013391\n(1983), we considered, but this time rejected, a similar\nEstablishment Clause challenge to a state tax deduction for\nexpenses incurred in attending such schools. And most recently, we\ndecided a preliminary issuein this very case, ruling that\nthe Tax Injunction Act, 28 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71341, posed no barrier to\nthe Plaintiffs\u2019 litigation of their Establishment Clause claim. SeeWinn I, 542 U. S., at 112.[Footnote 3] The Court in all five of these cases divided\nsharply on the merits of the disputes. But in one respect, the\nJustices were unanimous: Not a single one thought to question the\nlitigants\u2019 standing.The Solicitor General, participating here asamicus curiae, conceded at oral argument that under the\nFederal Government\u2019s\u2014and now the Court\u2019s\u2014view of taxpayer standing,\neach of these five cases should have been dismissed for lack of\njurisdiction.\u201c[The Court:] So if you are right, \u2026 the Court was\nwithout authority to decideWalz,Nyquist,Hunt,Mueller, [and]Hibbs[v.Winn,] this very case, just a few years\nago?\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.[Solicitor General:] Right\u2026\u00a0. [M]y answer to you is\nyes.[The Court:] I just want to make sure I heard your answer to\nthe\u2014you said the answer is yes. In other words, you agree \u2026 those\ncases were wrongly decided\u2026\u00a0. [Y]ou would have said there\nwould have been no standing in those cases.[Solicitor General:] No taxpayer standing.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg.\n10\u201312.Nor could the Solicitor General have answered\ndifferently. Each of these suits, as described above, alleged that\na state tax expenditure violated the Establishment Clause. And each\nreliedonlyon taxpayer standing as the basis for\nfederal-court review.[Footnote\n4] The Court today speculates that \u201cthe plaintiffs in those\ncases could have advanced arguments for jurisdiction independent ofFlast.\u201dAnte, at 18. But whatever could have\nbeen, in fact not one of them did so.And the Court itself understood the basis of\nstanding in these five cases. This and every federal court has an\nindependent obligation to consider standing, even when the parties\ndo not call it into question. See,e.g., FW/PBS, Inc.v.Dallas,493\nU. S. 215, 230\u2013231 (1990). To do anything else would risk an\nunlawful exercise of judicial authority. And in these cases the\nCourt had an additional prompt: In several of them,amici,\nincluding the United States, contested\u2014or at least raised as a\nquestion\u2014the plaintiffs\u2019 standing as taxpayers to pursue their\nclaims.[Footnote 5] The Court,\nmoreover, was well aware at the time of the issues presented by\ntaxpayer standing. We decided three of the cases within a year of\nelaborating the general bar on taxpayer suits, see,e.g.,\nUnited Statesv.Richardson,418 U. S. 166(1974);Schlesingerv.Reservists Comm. to Stop the War,418 U. S. 208(1974), and the fourth just after we held that bar applicable to a\ndifferent kind of Establishment Clause claim, seeValley Forge\nChristian Collegev.Americans United for Separation of\nChurch and State, Inc.,454 U. S. 464(1982).\nIndeed, the decisions on their face reflect the Court\u2019s recognition\nof what gave the plaintiffs standing; in each, we specifically\ndescribed the plaintiffs as taxpayers who challenged the use of the\ntax system to fund religious activities. SeeWinn I, 542\nU. S., at 94;Mueller, 463 U. S., at 392;Nyquist, 413 U. S., at 759, 762;Hunt, 413 U. S.,\nat 735\u2013736;Walz, 397 U. S., at 666\u2013667. In short, we\nconsidered and decided all these cases because we thought taxpayer\nstanding existed.The majority shrugs off these decisions\nbecause they did not discuss what was taken as obvious.Ante, at 17. But we have previously stressed that the\nCourt should not \u201cdisregard the implications of an exercise of\njudicial authority assumed to be proper for over 40 years.\u201dBrown Shoe Co.v.United States,370 U. S. 294, 307\n(1962); seeBowenv.Kendrick,487 U. S. 589, 619\n(1988) (finding standing partly because the Court, in deciding\nsimilar cases, had \u201cnot questioned the standing of taxpayer\nplaintiffs to raise Establishment Clause challenges\u201d);Bank of\nUnited Statesv.Deveaux, 5 Cranch 61, 88 (1809)\n(Marshall, C.\u00a0J.) (prior decisions exercising but not\ndiscussing jurisdiction \u201chave much weight, as they show that [a\njurisdictional flaw] neither occurred to the bar or the bench\u201d).\nAnd that principle has extra force here, because we have relied on\nsome of these decisions to support the Court\u2019s jurisdiction in\nother cases. Pause on that for a moment: The very decisions the\nmajority today so easily dismisses are featured in our prior cases\nas exemplars ofjurisdiction. So inSchool Dist. of\nGrand Rapidsv.Ball,473 U. S. 373(1985), we\nrelied onNyquistandHuntto conclude that\ntaxpayers had standing to challenge a program of aid to religious\nand other private schools. 473 U. S., at 380, n. 5, overruled in\npart on other grounds byAgostiniv.Felton,521 U. S. 203(1997). And inWinn I(recall, an earlier iteration of\nthis case), we rejected a different jurisdictional objection in\npart by relying onMuellerandNyquist. We called\nthose cases \u201cadjudications of great moment discerning no\n[jurisdictional] barrier\u201d and warned that they could not \u201cbe\nwritten off as reflecting nothing more than unexamined custom or\nunthinking habit.\u201d 542 U. S., at 112, n. 13 (internal quotation\nmarks and citations omitted). Until today, that is\u2014when the\nmajority does write off these adjudications and reaches a result\nagainst all precedent.BOur taxpayer standing\ncases have declined to distinguish between appropriations and tax\nexpenditures for a simple reason: Here, as in many contexts, the\ndistinction is one in search of a difference. To begin to see why,\nconsider an example far afield fromFlastand, indeed,\nfrom religion. Imagine that the Federal Government decides it\nshould pay hundreds of billions of dollars to insolvent banks in\nthe midst of a financial crisis. Suppose, too, that many millions\nof taxpayers oppose this bailout on the ground (whether right or\nwrong is immaterial) that it uses their hard-earned money to reward\nirresponsible business behavior. In the face of this hostility,\nsome Members of Congress make the following proposal: Rather than\ngive the money to banks via appropriations, the Government will\nallow banks to subtract the exact same amount from the tax bill\nthey would otherwise have to pay to the U. S. Treasury. Would this\nproposal calm the furor? Or would most taxpayers respond by saying\nthat a subsidy is a subsidy (or a bailout is a bailout), whether\naccomplished by the one means or by the other? Surely the latter;\nindeed, we would think the less of our countrymen if they failed to\nsee through this cynical proposal.And what ordinary\npeople would appreciate, this Court\u2019s case law also recognizes\u2014that\ntargeted tax breaks are often \u201ceconomically and functionally\nindistinguishable from a direct monetary subsidy.\u201dRosenbergerv.Rector and Visitors of Univ. of\nVa.,515 U. S.\n819, 859 (1995) (Thomas, J., concurring). Tax credits,\ndeductions, and exemptions provided to an individual or\norganization have \u201cmuch the same effect as a cash grant to the\n[recipient] of the amount of tax it would have to pay\u201d absent the\ntax break.Reganv.Taxation With Representation of\nWash.,461 U.\nS. 540, 544 (1983). \u201cOur opinions,\u201d therefore, \u201chave long\nrecognized \u2026\u00a0the reality that [tax expenditures] are a form of\nsubsidy that is administered through the tax system.\u201dArkansas\nWriters\u2019 Project, Inc.v.Ragland,481 U. S. 221, 236\n(1987) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (internal quotation marks omitted).\nOr again: Tax breaks \u201ccan be viewed as a form of government\nspending,\u201dCamps Newfound/Owatonna, Inc.v.Town of\nHarrison,520\nU. S. 564, 589\u2013590, n. 22 (1997), even assuming the diverted\ntax funds do not pass through the public treasury. And once more:\nBoth special tax benefits and cash grants \u201crepresen[t] a charge\nmade upon the state,\u201dNyquist, 413 U. S., at 790\u2013791\n(internal quotation marks omitted); both deplete funds in the\ngovernment\u2019s coffers by transferring money to select\nrecipients.[Footnote\n6]For just this reason, government\nbudgeting rules routinely insist on calculation of tax subsidies,\nin addition to appropriations. The President must provide\ninformation on the estimated cost of tax expenditures in the budget\nhe submits to Congress each year. See 31 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a71105(a)(16); n.\u00a01,supra. Similarly, congressional\nbudget committees must report to all Members on the level of tax\nexpenditures in the federal budget. See 2 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7632(e)(2)(E). Many States\u2014including Arizona\u2014likewise compute the\nimpact of targeted tax breaks on the public treasury, in\nrecognition that these measures are just spending under a different\nname, see n.\u00a01,supra. The Arizona Department of\nRevenue must issue an annual report \u201cdetailing the approximate\ncosts in lost revenue for all state tax expenditures.\u201d Ariz. Rev.\nStat. Ann. \u00a742\u20131005(A)(4) (West 2006). The most recent report notes\nthe significance of this accounting in the budget process. It\nexplains that \u201cthe fiscal impact of implementing\u201d targeted tax\nbreaks, including the STO credit challenged here, is \u201csimilar to a\ndirect expenditure of state funds.\u201d Arizona Dept. of Revenue,\nRevenue Impact of Arizona\u2019s Tax Expenditures FY 2009/10, p. 1\n(preliminary Nov. 15, 2010); see also Surrey, Tax Incentives as a\nDevice for Implementing Government Policy: A Comparison with Direct\nGovernment Expenditures, 83 Harv. L.\u00a0Rev. 705, 717 (1970) (\u201cA\ndollar is a dollar\u2014both for the person who receives it and the\ngovernment that pays it, whether the dollar comes with a tax credit\nlabel or a direct expenditure label\u201d).And because these financing\nmechanisms result in the same bottom line, taxpayers challenging\nthem can allege the same harm. Our prior cases have often\nrecognized the cost that targeted tax breaks impose on taxpayers\ngenerally. \u201cWhen the Government grants exemptions or allows\ndeductions\u201d to some, we have observed, \u201call taxpayers are affected;\nthe very fact of the exemption or deduction \u2026 means that other\ntaxpayers can be said to be indirect and vicarious \u2018donors.\u2019\u00a0\u201dBob Jones Univ.v.United States,461 U. S. 574, 591\n(1983). And again: \u201cEvery tax exemption constitutes a subsidy that\naffects nonqualifying taxpayers, forcing them to\u201d bear its cost.Texas Monthly, Inc.v.Bullock,489 U. S. 1, 14 (1989)\n(plurality opinion). Indeed, we have specifically compared the harm\narising from a tax subsidy with that arising from a cash grant, and\ndeclared those injuries equivalent because both kinds of support\ndeplete the public fisc. \u201cIn either case,\u201d we stated, \u201cthe alleged\ninjury is based on the asserted effect of the allegedly illegal\nactivity on public revenues, to which the taxpayer contributes.\u201dDaimlerChrysler Corp.v.Cuno,547 U. S. 332, 344 (2006). This\ntaxpayer injury of course fails to establish standing in the\nmine-run case, whatever form the state aid takes. See,e.g.,\nid.,at 343\u2013344;ante, at 6\u201310;supra,at 3.\nBut the key is this: Whenever taxpayers have standing underFlastto challenge an appropriation, they should also have\nstanding to contest a tax expenditure. Their access to the federal\ncourts should not depend on which type of financial subsidy the\nState has offered.Consider some further examples of\nthe point, but this time concerning state funding of religion.\nSuppose a State desires to reward Jews\u2014by, say, $500 per year\u2014for\ntheir religious devotion. Should the nature of taxpayers\u2019 concern\nvary if the State allows Jews to claim the aid on their tax\nreturns, in lieu of receiving an annual stipend? Or assume a State\nwishes to subsidize the ownership of crucifixes. It could purchase\nthe religious symbols in bulk and distribute them to all takers. Or\nit could mail a reimbursement check to any individual who buys her\nown and submits a receipt for the purchase. Or it could authorize\nthat person to claim a tax credit equal to the price she paid. Now,\nreally\u2014do taxpayers have less reason to complain if the State\nselects the last of these three options? The Court today says they\ndo, but that is wrong. The effect of each form of subsidy is the\nsame, on the public fisc and on those who contribute to it.\nRegardless of which mechanism the State uses, taxpayers have an\nidentical stake in ensuring that the State\u2019s exercise of its taxing\nand spending power complies with the Constitution.[Footnote 7]Here, the mechanism Arizona has\nselected is a dollar-for-dollar tax credit to aid school tuition\norganizations. Each year come April 15, the State tells Arizonans:\nEither pay the full amount of your tax liability to the State, or\nsubtract up to $500 from your tax bill by contributing that sum to\nan STO. SeeWinn I, 542 U. S., at 95. To claim the credit,\nan individual makes a notation on her tax return and splits her tax\npayment into two checks, one made out to the State and the other to\nthe STO. As this Court recognized inWinn I, the STO\npayment is therefore \u201ccostless\u201d to the individual,ibid.;it comes out of what she otherwise would be legally obligated to\npay the State\u2014hence, out of public resources. And STOs capitalize\non this aspect of the tax credit for all it is worth\u2014which is quite\na lot. To drum up support, STOs highlight that \u201cdonations\u201d are made\nnot with an individual\u2019s own, but with other\npeople\u2019s\u2014i.e., taxpayers\u2019\u2014money. One STO advertises that\n\u201c[w]ith Arizona\u2019s scholarship tax credit, you can send children to\nour community\u2019s [religious] day schools and it won\u2019t cost you a\ndime!\u201d Brief for Respondents 13 (internal quotation marks and\nemphasis omitted). Another urges potential donors to \u201cimagine\ngiving [to charity] with someone else\u2019s money\u2026\u00a0. Stop\nImagining, thanks to Arizona tax laws you can!\u201dId.,at 14\n(internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted). And so Arizonans\ndo just that: It is, after all, good fun to spend other people\u2019s\nmoney. By the State\u2019s reckoning, from 1998 to 2008 the credit cost\nArizona almost $350 million in redirected tax revenue.[Footnote 8]The Plaintiffs contend that this\nexpenditure violates the Establishment Clause. If the legislature\nhad appropriated these monies for STOs, the Plaintiffs would have\nstanding, beyond any dispute, to argue the merits of their claim in\nfederal court. But the Plaintiffs have no such recourse, the Court\ntoday holds, because Arizona funds STOs through a tax credit rather\nthan a cash grant. No less than in the hypothetical examples\noffered above, here too form prevails over substance, and\ndifferences that make no difference determine access to the\nJudiciary. And the casualty is a historic and vital method of\nenforcing the Constitution\u2019s guarantee of religious\nneutrality.CThe majority offers\njust one reason to distinguish appropriations and tax expenditures:\nA taxpayer experiences injury, the Court asserts, only when the\ngovernment \u201cextracts and spends\u201d her very own tax dollars to aid\nreligion.Ante, at 15 (internal quotation marks and\nalterations omitted). In other words, a taxpayer suffers legally\ncognizable harm if but only if her particular tax dollars wind up\nin a religious organization\u2019s coffers. See also Tr. of Oral Arg. 4\n(Solicitor General proposing that the \u201ckey point\u201d was: \u201cIf you\nplaced an electronic tag to track and monitor each cent that the\n[Plaintiffs] pay in tax,\u201d none goes to religious STOs). And no\ntaxpayer can make this showing, the Court concludes, if the\ngovernment subsidizes religion through tax credits, deductions, or\nexemptions (rather than through appropriations).[Footnote 9]The majority purports\nto rely onFlastto support this new \u201cextraction\u201d\nrequirement. It plucks the three words \u201cextrac[t] and spen[d]\u201d from\nthe midst of theFlastopinion, and suggests that they\nseverely constrict the decision\u2019s scope.Ante, at 15\n(quoting 392 U. S., at 106). And it notes thatFlastpartly relied on James Madison\u2019s famed argument in the Memorial and\nRemonstrance Against Religious Assessments: \u201c\u00a0\u2018[T]he same\nauthority which can force a citizen to contribute three pence only\nof his property for the support of any one establishment, may force\nhim to conform to any other establishment in all cases\nwhatsoever.\u2019\u00a0\u201d 392 U. S., at 103 (quoting 2 Writings of James\nMadison 183, 186 (G. Hunt ed. 1901)); seeante,at 12\u201314.\nAnd that is all the majority can come up with.But as indicated earlier,\neverything of import inFlastcuts against the majority\u2019s\nposition. Here is howFlaststated its holding: \u201c[W]e hold\nthat a taxpayer will have standing consistent with Article III to\ninvoke federal judicial power when he alleges that congressional\naction under the taxing and spending clause is in derogation of\u201d\nthe Establishment Clause. 392 U. S., at 105\u2013106. Nothing in that\nstraightforward sentence supports the idea that a taxpayer can\nchallenge only legislative action that disburses his particular\ncontribution to the state treasury. And here is howFlastprimarily justified its holding: \u201c[O]ne of the specific evils\nfeared by those who drafted the Establishment Clause and fought for\nits adoption was that the taxing and spending power would be used\nto favor one religion over another or to support religion in\ngeneral.\u201dId., at 103. That evil arises even if the\nspecific dollars that the government uses do not come from citizens\nwho object to the preference. Likewise, the two-part nexus test,\nwhich is the heart ofFlast\u2019s doctrinal analysis, contains\nno hint of an extraction requirement. Seesupra, at 4. And\nfinally, James Madison provides no comfort to today\u2019s majority. He\nreferred to \u201cthree pence\u201d exactly because it was, even in 1785, a\nmeaningless sum of money; then, as today, the core injury of a\nreligious establishment had naught to do with any given\nindividual\u2019s out-of-pocket loss. Seeinfra, at 21\u201323\n(further discussing Madison\u2019s views). So the majority is left with\nnothing, save for three wordsFlastused to describe the\nparticular facts in that case: In not a single non-trivial respect\ncould theFlastCourt recognize its handiwork in the\nmajority\u2019s depiction.The injury to taxpayers thatFlastperceived arose whenever the legislature used its\ntaxing-and-spending power to channel tax dollars to religious\nactivities. In that and subsequent cases (including the five in\nthis Court involving tax expenditures), a taxpayer pleaded the\nrequisite harm by stating that public resources were funding\nreligion; the tracing of particular dollars (whether by the\nSolicitor General\u2019s \u201celectronic tag\u201d or other means) did not enter\ninto the question. SeeDaimlerChrysler Corp., 547 U. S.,\nat 348 (describing how theFlastCourt\u2019s understanding of\nthe Establishment Clause\u2019s history led the Court to view the\nalleged \u201cinjury\u201d as the expenditure of \u201c\u00a0\u2018tax money\u2019 in aid of\nreligion\u201d (quotingFlast, 392 U. S., at 106)). And for all\nthe reasons already given, that standard is met regardless whether\nthe funding is provided via cash grant or tax expenditure. Seesupra, at 11\u201316. Taxpayers pick up the cost of the subsidy\nin either form. Seeibid. So taxpayers have an interest in\npreventing the use of either mechanism to infringe religious\nneutrality.[Footnote\n10]Indeed, the majority\u2019s new\nconception of injury is at odds not merely withFlast, but\nalso (if ironically) with our cases precluding taxpayer standing\ngenerally. Seesupra, at 3;ante, at 6\u201310.\nToday\u2019s majority insists that legislation challenged under the\nEstablishment Clause must \u201cextrac[t] and spen[d] a conscientious\ndissenter\u2019s funds.\u201dAnte, at 15. But we have rejected\ntaxpayer standing in other contexts because each taxpayer\u2019s share\nof treasury funds is \u201cminute and indeterminable.\u201dFrothingham, 262 U. S., at 487. No taxpayer can point to\nan expenditure (by cash grant or otherwise) and say that her own\ntax dollars are in the mix; in fact, they almost surely are not.\n\u201c[I]t is,\u201d as we have noted, \u201ca complete fiction to argue that an\nunconstitutional \u2026 expenditure causes an individual \u2026 taxpayer any\nmeasurable economic harm.\u201dHein, 551 U. S., at 593\n(plurality opinion). That is as true in Establishment Clause cases\nas in any others. Taxpayers have standing in these casesdespitetheir foreseeable failure to show that the alleged\nconstitutional violation involves their own tax dollars, notbecausethe State has used their particular\nfunds.And something still deeper is\nwrong with the majority\u2019s \u201cextract and spend\u201d requirement: It does\nnot measure what matters under the Establishment Clause. Let us\nindulge the Court\u2019s fiction that a taxpayer\u2019s \u201c.000000000001 penny\u201d\nis somehow involved in an ordinary appropriation of public funds\nfor religious activity (thus supposedly distinguishing it from a\ntax expenditure). Still, consider the following example: Imagine\nthe Internal Revenue Service places a checkbox on tax returns\nasking filers if they object to the government using their taxes to\naid religion. If the government keeps \u201cyes\u201d money separate from\n\u201cno\u201d money and subsidizes religious activities only from the\nnonobjectors\u2019 account, the majority\u2019s analysis suggests that no\ntaxpayer would have standing to allege a violation of the\nEstablishment Clause. The funds used, after all, would not have\nbeen \u201cextracted from a citizen and handed to a religious\ninstitution in violation of the citizen\u2019s conscience.\u201dAnte, at 16. But this Court has never indicated that\nStates may insulate subsidies to religious organizations from legal\nchallenge by eliciting the consent of some taxpayers. And the Court\nhas of course been right not to take this approach. Taxpayers incur\nthe same harm, and should have the same ability to bring suit,\nwhether the government stores tax funds in one bank account or two.\nNone of the principles underlying the Establishment Clause suggests\notherwise.James Madison, whom the Court\nagain rightly labels \u201cthe leading architect of the religion\nclauses,\u201dante, at 13 (quotingFlast, 392 U. S.,\nat 103; internal quotation marks omitted), had something important\nto say about the matter of \u201cextraction.\u201d As the majority notes,\nMadison\u2019s Memorial and Remonstrance criticized a tax levy proposed\nin Virginia to aid teachers of the Christian religion.Ante, at 12\u201313. But Madison\u2019s passionate opposition to\nthat proposal informs this case in a manner different than the\nmajority suggests. The Virginia tax in fact would not have\nextracted any monies (not even \u201cthree pence\u201d) from unwilling\ncitizens, as the Court now requires. The plan allowed conscientious\nobjectors to opt out of subsidizing religion by contributing their\nassessment to an alternative fund for the construction and\nmaintenance of county schools.[Footnote 11] See A Bill Establishing A Provision for\nTeachers of the Christian Religion, reprinted inEversonv.Board of Ed. of Ewing,330 U. S. 1, 74 (1947) (supplemental\nappendix to dissent of Rutledge, J.); Letter from James Madison to\nThomas Jefferson (Jan. 9, 1785), reprinted in 2 Writings of James\nMadison, at 102, 113; see also Blasi, School Vouchers and Religious\nLiberty: Seven Questions from Madison\u2019sMemorial and\nRemonstrance, 87 Cornell L.\u00a0Rev. 783, 784 (2002) (the tax\nprovision \u201cpermitted each taxpayer to\u00a0specify which Christian\ndenomination should receive\u00a0his\u00a0payment\u201d and \u201c[t]hose who\ndid not wish to support\u00a0a\u00a0church could direct their\nassessment to a proposed\u00a0common school fund\u201d). Indeed, the\nVirginia Assessment was specifically \u201cdesigned to avoid any charges\nof coercion of dissenters to pay taxes to support religious\nteachings with which they disagreed.\u201d Feldman, Intellectual Origins\nof the Establishment Clause, 77 N.\u00a0Y. U. L.\u00a0Rev. 346, 383\n(2002).[Footnote\n12]In this respect, the Virginia\nAssessment is just like the Arizona tax credit. Although both\nfunnel tax funds to religious organizations (and so saddlealltaxpayers with the cost), neither forces any given\ntaxpayer to pay for the subsidy out of her pocket. Madison thought\nthat feature of the Assessment insufficient to save it. By relying\non the selfsame aspect of the Arizona scheme to deny the\nPlaintiffs\u2019 claim of injury, the majority betrays Madison\u2019s\nvision.IIIToday\u2019s decision\ndevastates taxpayer standing in Establishment Clause cases. The\ngovernment, after all, often uses tax expenditures to subsidize\nfavored persons and activities. Still more, the government almostalwayshas this option. Appropriations and tax subsidies\nare readily interchangeable; what is a cash grant today can be a\ntax break tomorrow. The Court\u2019s opinion thus offers a roadmap\u2014more\ntruly, just a one-step instruction\u2014to any government that wishes to\ninsulate its financing of religious activity from legal challenge.\nStructure the funding as a tax expenditure, andFlastwill\nnot stand in the way. No taxpayer will have standing to object.\nHowever blatantly the government may violate the Establishment\nClause, taxpayers cannot gain access to the federal\ncourts.And by ravagingFlastin this way, today\u2019s decision damages one of this\nNation\u2019s defining constitutional commitments. \u201cCongress shall make\nno law respecting an establishment of religion\u201d\u2014ten simple words\nthat have stood for over 200 years as a foundation stone of\nAmerican religious liberty. Ten words that this Court has long\nunderstood, as James Madison did, to limit (though by no means\neliminate) the government\u2019s power to finance religious activity.\nThe Court\u2019s ruling today will not shield all state subsidies for\nreligion from review; as the Court notes, some persons alleging\nEstablishment Clause violations have suffered individualized\ninjuries, and therefore have standing, independent of their\ntaxpayer status. Seeante, at 1\u20132, 17\u201318. ButFlastarose because \u201cthe taxing and spending power [may]\nbe used to favor one religion over another or to support religion\nin general,\u201d 392 U. S., at 103,without causing\nparticularized harm to discrete persons. It arose because state\nsponsorship of religion sometimes harms individuals only (but this\n\u201conly\u201d is no small matter) in their capacity as contributing\nmembers of our national community. In those cases, theFlastCourt thought, our Constitution\u2019s guarantee of\nreligious neutrality still should be enforced.Because that judgment\nwas right then, and remains right today, I respectfully\ndissent.Footnote\n1\u201cTax expenditures\u201d\nare monetary subsidies the government bestows on particular\nindividuals or organizations by granting them preferential tax\ntreatment.

Seeante, at 1\u20132,\n17\u201318. That is quite right; indeed, some parents or children likely\nhave standing to challenge the Arizona tax credit on such grounds.\nBut this possibility does not detract from the point made here. The\npurpose of these illustrations is to show thatiftaxpayer\nstatus is the thing alleged to confer standing, it should do so\nirrespective of the form of the government\nsubsidy.Footnote 8See\nArizona Dept. of Revenue, Revenue Impact of Arizona\u2019s Tax\nExpenditures FY 2009/10, p. 48 (preliminary Nov. 15, 2010); FY\n2008/09, p. 54 (preliminary Nov. 16, 2009); FY 2007/08, p. 58\n(preliminary Nov. 17, 2008); FY 2006/07, p. 65 (preliminary Nov.\n15, 2007/final Sept. 2010); FY 2005/06, p. 73 (preliminary Nov. 15,\n2006/final Dec. 2009); FY\u00a02004/05, p. 72 (preliminary Nov. 15,\n2005/final June 2009); FY 2003/04, p. 74 (preliminary Nov. 14,\n2004/final Feb. 2007); FY 2002/03, p. 74 (preliminary Nov. 15,\n2003/final Mar. 2007); FY 2001/02, p. 71 (preliminary Nov. 15,\n2002/final Mar. 2004); FY\u00a02000/01, p. 73 (preliminary Nov. 15,\n2001/final July 2003); FY 1999/00, p. 72 (preliminary Nov. 15,\n2000/final Aug. 2002).Footnote 9Even\ntaken on its own terms, the majority\u2019s reasoning does not justify\nthe conclusion that the Plaintiffs lack standing. Arizona\u2019s\ntuition-tax-credit program in fact necessitates the direct\nexpenditure of funds from the state treasury. After all, the\nstatute establishing the initiative requires the Arizona Department\nof Revenue to certify STOs, maintain an STO registry, make the\nregistry available to the public on request and post it on a\nwebsite, collect annual reports filed by STOs, and send written\nnotice to STOs that have failed to comply with statutory\nrequirements. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a743\u20131502(A)\u2013(C), 43\u20131506 (West\nSupp. 2010). Presumably all these activities cost money, which\ncomes from the state treasury. Thus, on the majority\u2019s own theory,\nthe government has \u201cextract[ed] and spen[t]\u201d the Plaintiffs\u2019 (along\nwith other taxpayers\u2019) dollars to implement the challenged program,\nand the Plaintiffs should have standing. (The majority, after all,\nmakes clear that nothing in its analysis hinges on the size or\nproportion of the Plaintiffs\u2019 contribution.Ante, at 13.)\nBut applying the majority\u2019s theory in this way reveals the\nhollowness at its core. Can anyone believe that the Plaintiffs have\nsuffered injury through the costs involved in administering the\nprogram, but not through the far greater costs of granting the tax\nexpenditure in the first place?Footnote 10On this\ntraditional view of the harm to taxpayers arising from state\nfinancing of religion, the Plaintiffs here can satisfy not only\nArticle III\u2019s injury requirement, but also its causation and\nredressability requirements. The majority\u2019s contrary position,ante, at 15\u201316, stems from its miscasting of the injury\ninvolved; once that harm is stated correctly, all the rest follows.\nTo wit: The Plaintiffs allege they sufferinjurywhen the\nState funnels public resources to religious organizations through\nthe tax credit. Arizona, they claim, hascausedthis\ninjury by enacting legislation that establishes the credit. And an\ninjunction limiting the credit\u2019s operation wouldredressthe harm by preventing the allegedly unlawful diversion of tax\nrevenues. The Plaintiffs need not, as the majority insists, show\nthat this remedy would \u201caffect \u2026 their tax payments,\u201dante, at 16, any more than the taxpayer inFlasthad to establish that her tax burden would decrease absent the\nGovernment\u2019s funding of religious schools. As we have previously\nrecognized, when taxpayers object to the spending of tax money in\nviolation of the Establishment Clause (whether through tax credits\nor appropriations), \u201can injunction against the spending would \u2026\nredress [their] injury, regardless of whether lawmakers would\ndispose of the savings in a way that would benefit the\ntaxpayer-plaintiffs personally.\u201dDaimlerChrysler Corp.v.Cuno,547 U.
