    "text": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES_________________No. 11\u20139540_________________MATTHEW ROBERT DESCAMPS, PETITIONER v. UNITED\nSTATESon writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the ninth circuit[June 20, 2013]Justice Thomas,\nconcurring in the judgment.Petitioner Matthew\nDescamps was convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm,\n18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7922(g), which subjected him to a\nmaximum sentence of 10 years\u2019 imprisonment. The District\nCourt, however, applied an Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA)\nenhancement with a mandatory minimum of 15 years based in part on\nDescamps\u2019 earlier California conviction for burglary. See\n\u00a7924(e). The California law says that any \u201cperson who\nenters\u201d any of a number of structures \u201cwith intent to\ncommit grand or petit larceny or any felony is guilty of\nburglary.\u201d California Penal Code Ann. \u00a7459 (West 2010).\nThat law does not, on its face, require the jury to determine\nwhether the entry itself was unlawful, a required element of the\nso-called \u201cgeneric\u201d offense of burglary that qualifies\nas an ACCA predicate. See Taylor v. United States, 495 U.\u00a0S.\n575, 599 (1990) . The majority holds that a court may not review\nthe underlying facts of Descamps\u2019 state crime to determine\nwhether he entered the building unlawfully and, thus, that his\nburglary conviction may not be used as a predicate offense under\nACCA. While I agree with the Court\u2019s conclusion, I disagree\nwith its reasoning.I have previously\nexplained that ACCA runs afoul of Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530\nU.\u00a0S. 466 (2000) , because it allows the judge to\n\u201cmak[e] a finding that raises [a defendant\u2019s] sentence\nbeyond the sentence that could have lawfully been imposed by\nreference to facts found by the jury or admitted by the\ndefendant.\u201d James v. United States, 550 U.\u00a0S. 192, 231\n(2007) (dissenting opinion) (internal quotation marks omitted).\nUnder the logic of Apprendi, a court may not find facts about a\nprior conviction when such findings increase the statutory maximum.\nThis is so whether a court is determining whether a prior\nconviction was entered, see 530 U.\u00a0S., at 520\u2013521\n(Thomas, J., concurring), or attempting to discern what facts were\nnecessary to a prior conviction. See James, su- pra, at\n231\u2013232 (Thomas, J., dissenting). In either case, the court\nis inappropriately finding a fact that must be submitted to the\njury because it \u201cincreases the penalty for a crime beyond the\nprescribed statutory maximum.\u201d Apprendi, supra, at 490.In light of the\nforegoing, it does not matter whether a statute is\n\u201cdivisible\u201d or \u201cindivisible,\u201d see ante, at\n1\u20132, and courts should not have to struggle with the contours\nof the so-called \u201cmodified categorical\u201d approach. Ibid.\nThe only reason Descamps\u2019 ACCA enhancement is before us is\n\u201cbecause this Court has not yet reconsidered\nAlmendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U.\u00a0S. 224 (1998) ,\nwhich draws an exception to the Apprendi line of cases for judicial\nfactfinding that concerns a defendant\u2019s prior\nconvictions.\u201d Shepard v. United States, 544 U.\u00a0S. 13, 27\n(2005) (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).\nRegardless of the framework adopted, judicial factfinding increases\nthe statutory maximum in violation of the Sixth Amendment. However,\nbecause today\u2019s opinion at least limits the situations in\nwhich courts make factual determinations about prior convictions, I\nconcur in the judgment.",
