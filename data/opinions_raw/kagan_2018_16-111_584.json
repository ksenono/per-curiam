But in\nupholding that principle, state actors cannot show hostility to\nreligious views; rather, they must give those views \u201cneutral and\nrespectful consideration.\u201dAnte, at 12. I join the Court\u2019s\nopinion in full because I believe the Colorado Civil Rights\nCommission did not satisfy that obligation. I write separately to\nelaborate on one of the bases for the Court\u2019s holding.The Court partly relies on the \u201cdisparate\nconsideration of Phillips\u2019 case compared to the cases of [three]\nother bakers\u201d who \u201cobjected to a requested cake on the basis of\nconscience.\u201dAnte, at 14, 18. In the latter cases, a\ncustomer named William Jack sought \u201ccakes with images that conveyed\ndisapproval of same-sex marriage, along with religious text\u201d; the\nbakers whom he approached refused to make them.Ante, at 15;\nseepost, at 3 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting) (further\ndescribing the requested cakes). Those bakers prevailed before the\nColorado Civil Rights Division and Commission, while Phillips\u2014who\nobjected for religious reasons to baking a wedding cake for a\nsame-sex couple\u2014did not. The Court finds that the legal reasoning\nof the state agencies differed in significant ways as between the\nJack cases and the Phillips case. Seeante,at 15. And the\nCourt takes especial note of the suggestion made by the Colorado\nCourt of Appeals, in comparing those cases, that the state agencies\nfound the message Jack requested \u201coffensive [in] nature.\u201dAnte, at 16 (internal quotation marks omitted). As the Court\nstates, a \u201cprincipled rationale for the difference in treatment\u201d\ncannot be \u201cbased on the government\u2019s own assessment of\noffensiveness.\u201dIbid.What makes the state agencies\u2019 consideration yet\nmore disquieting is that a proper basis for distinguishing the\ncases was available\u2014in fact, was obvious. The Colorado\nAnti-Discrimination Act (CADA) makes it unlawful for a place of\npublic accommodation to deny \u201cthe full and equal enjoyment\u201d of\ngoods and services to individuals based on certain characteristics,\nincluding sexual orientation and creed. Colo. Rev. Stat.\n\u00a724\u201334\u2013601(2)(a) (2017). The three bakers in the Jack cases did not\nviolate that law. Jack requested them to make a cake (one\ndenigrating gay people and same-sex marriage) that they would not\nhave made for any customer. In refusing that request, the bakers\ndid not single out Jack because of his religion, but instead\ntreated him in the same way they would have treated anyone\nelse\u2014just as CADA requires. By contrast, the same-sex couple in\nthis case requested a wedding cake that Phillips would have made\nfor an opposite-sex couple. In refusing that request, Phillips\ncontravened CADA\u2019s demand that customers receive \u201cthe full and\nequal enjoyment\u201d of public accommodations irrespective of their\nsexual orientation.Ibid.The different outcomes in the Jack\ncases and the Phillips case could thus have been justified by a\nplain reading and neutral application of Colorado law\u2014untainted by\nany bias against a religious belief.[1]*I read the Court\u2019s opinion as fully consistent\nwith that view. The Court limits its analysis to thereasoningof the state agencies (and Court of\nAppeals)\u2014\u201cquite apart from whether the [Phillips and Jack] cases\nshould ultimately be distinguished.\u201dAnte, at 15. And the\nCourt itself recognizes the principle that would properly account\nfor a difference inresultbetween those cases. Colorado\nlaw, the Court says, \u201ccan protect gay persons, just as it can\nprotect other classes of individuals, in acquiring whatever\nproducts and services they choose on the same terms and conditions\nas are offered to other members of the public.\u201dAnte, at 10.\nFor that reason, Colorado can treat a baker who discriminates based\non sexual orientation differently from a baker who does not\ndiscriminate on that or any other prohibited ground. But only, as\nthe Court rightly says, if the State\u2019s decisions are not infected\nby religious hostility or bias. I accordingly concur.Notes1*\u00a0Justice Gorsuch\ndisagrees. In his view, the Jack cases and the Phillips case must\nbe treated the same because the bakers in all those cases \u201cwould\nnot sell the requested cakes to anyone.\u201dPost, at 4. That\ndescription perfectly fits the Jack cases\u2014and explains why the\nbakers there did not engage in unlawful discrimination. But it is a\nsurprising characterization of the Phillips case, given that\nPhillips routinely sells wedding cakes to opposite-sex couples.\nJustice Gorsuch can make the claim only because he does not think a\n\u201cwedding cake\u201d is the relevant product. As Justice Gorsuch sees it,\nthe product that Phillips refused to sell here\u2014and would refuse to\nsell to anyone\u2014was a \u201ccake celebrating same-sex marriage.\u201dIbid.; seepost, at 3, 6, 8\u20139. But that is wrong. The\ncake requested was not a special \u201ccake celebrating same-sex\nmarriage.\u201d It was simply a wedding cake\u2014one that (like other\nstandard wedding cakes) is suitable for use at same-sex and\nopposite-sex weddings alike. Seeante, at 4 (majority\nopinion) (recounting that Phillips did not so much as discuss the\ncake\u2019s design before he refused to make it). And contrary to\nJustice Gorsuch\u2019s view, a wedding cake does not become something\ndifferent whenever a vendor like Phillips invests its sale to\nparticular customers with \u201creligious significance.\u201dPost, at\n11. As this Court has long held, and reaffirms today, a vendor\ncannot escape a public accommodations law because his religion\ndisapproves selling a product to a group of customers, whether\ndefined by sexual orientation, race, sex, or other protected trait.\nSeeNewmanv.Piggie Park Enterprises, Inc., 390\nU.\u00a0S. 400, 402, n.\u00a05 (1968) (per curiam) (holding\nthat a barbeque vendor must serve black customers even if he\nperceives such service as vindicating racial equality, in violation\nof his religious beliefs);ante, at 9. A vendor can choose\nthe products he sells, but not the customers he serves\u2014no matter\nthe reason. Phillips sells wedding cakes. As to that product, he\nunlawfully discriminates: He sells it to opposite-sex but not to\nsame-sex couples. And on that basis\u2014which has nothing to do with\nPhillips\u2019 religious beliefs\u2014Colorado could have distinguished\nPhillips from the bakers in the Jack cases, who did not engage in\nany prohibited discrimination.",
