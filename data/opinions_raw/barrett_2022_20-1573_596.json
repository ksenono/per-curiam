I agree\nthat reversal is required under our precedent because PAGA\u2019s\nprocedure is akin to other aggregation devices that cannot be\nimposed on a party to an arbitration agreement. See,e.g.,Stolt-Nielsen S.\u00a0A.v.AnimalFeeds Int\u2019l Corp.,559 U.S.\n662(2010);AT&T Mobility LLCv.Concepcion,563 U.S.\n333(2011);Epic Systems Corp.v.Lewis, 584\nU.\u00a0S. ___ (2018);Lamps Plus, Inc.v.Varela,\n587 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2019). I would say nothing more than that. The\ndiscussion in Parts II and IV of the Court\u2019s opinion is unnecessary\nto the result, and much of it addresses disputed state-law\nquestions as well as arguments not pressed or passed upon in this\ncase.[1]*Notes1*The same is true of Part\nI.",
