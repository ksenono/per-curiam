Two years ago, I describedKatz\u2019s \u201cplan of the Convention\u201d analysis as \u201cgood for one\nclause only\u201d\u2014i.e., Article I\u2019s Bankruptcy Clause.Allenv.Cooper, 589 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___\u2013___ (2020)\n(slip op., at 8\u20139) (hyphens omitted); seeCentral Va. Community\nCollegev.Katz,546 U.S.\n356, 373\u2013379 (2006). I thought then that our precedents had\nshut the door on further Article I exceptions to state sovereign\nimmunity. ButPennEastproved me wrong. SeePennEast\nPipeline Co.v.New Jersey, 594 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2021).\nThe question there was whether the States had consented in the plan\nof the Convention to the Federal Government\u2019s exercise of Article\nI\u2019s eminent domain power, including through private parties\u2019 suits.\nRelying on our prior decisions, I concluded that the States had not\nso consented. Seeid., at ___\u2013___ (Barrett, J., dissenting)\n(slip op., at 1\u20134). But the Court ruled otherwise. Using a new\ntest, it held that the eminent domain power was \u201ccomplete in\nitself,\u201d meaning that the States had \u201cconsented to the [federal]\nexercise of that power[\u00a0] in its entirety.\u201dId., at ___\n(slip op., at 22).The question today, givenPennEast, is whether the same is true of the war powers.\nWere those powers also \u201ccomplete in themselves,\u201d so that the States\nlikewise consented to congressionally authorized private\nlitigation?The answer is yes, as the Court holds. Much more\nthan eminent domain, war powers lie at the heart of the\nConvention\u2019s plan. The overriding goal of the Convention was \u201cto\ncreate a cohesive national sovereign in response to the failings of\nthe Articles of Confederation.\u201dIbid.And among those\nfailings, none was more important than \u201cthe want of power in\nCongress to raise an army and the dependence upon the States\u201d to\nprovide armed forces.Selective Draft Law Cases,245 U.S.\n366, 381 (1918). For that reason, the war powers\u2014more than any\nother power, and surely more than eminent domain\u2014were \u201ccomplete in\nthemselves.\u201d They were given by the States, entirely and\nexclusively, to the Federal Government. Seeante, at 7\u201312;\nU. S. Const., Art. I, \u00a78, cls. 11\u201316, \u00a710, cls. 1, 3.PennEast\u2019s analysis thus compels today\u2019s result. In setting\nout the \u201ccomplete in itself\u00a0\u201d test, the Court there answered\nthe question here: At the Convention, the States waived their\nsovereign immunity to any suit Congress authorized under the war\npowers.",
