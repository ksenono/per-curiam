    "text": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES_________________No. 19\u20137_________________SEILA LAW LLC, PETITIONERv.CONSUMER\nFINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAUon writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the ninth circuit[June 29, 2020]Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Gorsuch\njoins, concurring in part and dissenting in part.The Court\u2019s decision today takes a restrained\napproach on the merits by limitingHumphrey\u2019s Executorv.United States,295 U.S.\n602(1935), rather than overruling it. At the same time, the\nCourt takes an aggressive approach on severability by severing a\nprovision when it is not necessary to do so. I would do the\nopposite.Because the Court takes a step in the right\ndirection by limitingHumphrey\u2019s Executorto \u201cmultimember\nexpert agencies thatdo not wield substantial executive\npower,\u201dante, at 16 (emphasis added), I join Parts I,\nII, and III of its opinion. I respectfully dissent from the Court\u2019s\nseverability analysis, however, because I do not believe that we\nshould address severability in this case.IThe decision inHumphrey\u2019s Executorposes a direct threat to our constitutional structure and, as a\nresult, the liberty of the American people. The Court concludes\nthat it is not strictly necessary for us to overrule that decision.\nSeeante, at 2, 13\u201317. But with today\u2019s decision, the Court\nhas repudiated almost every aspect ofHumphrey\u2019s Executor.\nIn a future case, I would repudiate what is left of this erroneous\nprecedent.A\u201cThe Constitution does not vest the Federal\nGovernment with an undifferentiated \u2018governmental power.\u2019\u00a0\u201dDepartment of Transportationv.Association of American\nRailroads, 575 U.S. 43, 67 (2015) (Thomas, J., concurring in\njudgment). It sets out three branches and vests a different form of\npower in each\u2014legislative, executive, and judicial. See Art. I, \u00a71;\nArt. II, \u00a71, cl.\u00a01; Art. III, \u00a71.Article II of the Constitution vests \u201c[t]he\nexecutive Power\u201d in the \u201cPresident of the United States of\nAmerica,\u201d \u00a71, cl. 1, and directs that he shall \u201ctake Care that the\nLaws be faithfully executed,\u201d \u00a73. Of course, the President cannot\nfulfill his role of executing the laws without assistance. SeeMyersv.United States,272 U.S.\n52, 117 (1926). He therefore must \u201cselect those who [are] to\nact for him under his direction in the execution of the laws.\u201dIbid.While these officers assist the President in carrying\nout his constitutionally assigned duties, \u201c[t]he buck stops with\nthe President.\u201dFree Enterprise Fundv.Public Company\nAccounting Oversight Bd.,561\nU.S. 477, 493 (2010). \u201cSince 1789, the Constitution has been\nunderstood to empower the President to keep [his] officers\naccountable\u2014by removing them from office, if necessary.\u201dId., at 483. The Framers \u201cinsist[ed]\u201d upon \u201cunity in the\nFederal Executive\u201d to \u201censure both vigor and accountability\u201d to the\npeople.Printzv.United States,521 U.S.\n898, 922 (1997); see alsoante, at 22.Despite the defined structural limitations of\nthe Constitution and the clear vesting of executive power in the\nPresident, Congress has increasingly shifted executive power to ade\u00a0factofourth branch of Government\u2014independent\nagencies. These agencies wield considerable executive power without\nPresidential oversight. They are led by officers who are insulated\nfrom the President by removal restrictions, \u201creduc[ing] the Chief\nMagistrate to [the role of] cajoler-in-chief.\u201dFree Enterprise\nFund, 561 U.\u00a0S., at 502. But \u201c[t]he people do not vote for\nthe Officers of the United States. They instead look to the\nPresident to guide the assistants or deputies subject to his\nsuperintendence.\u201dId., at 497\u2013498 (alterations, internal\nquotation marks and citation omitted). Because independent agencies\nwield substantial power with no accountability to either the\nPresident or the people, they \u201cpose a significant threat to\nindividual liberty and to the constitutional system of separation\nof powers and checks and balances.\u201dPHH Corp.v.CFPB, 881 F.3d 75, 165 (CADC 2018) (Kavanaugh, J.,\ndissenting).Unfortunately, this Court \u201cha[s] not always been\nvigilant about protecting the structure of our Constitution,\u201d at\ntimes endorsing a \u201cmore pragmatic, flexible approach\u201d to our\nGovernment\u2019s design.Perezv.Mortgage Bankers Assn.,\n575 U.S. 92, 115\u2013116 (2015) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Our tolerance of independent\nagencies inHumphrey\u2019s Executoris an unfortunate example of\nthe Court\u2019s failure to apply the Constitution as written. That\ndecision has paved the way for an ever-expanding encroachment on\nthe power of the Executive, contrary to our constitutional\ndesign.B1The lead up toHumphrey\u2019s Executorbegins with this Court\u2019s decision inMyers,272 U.S.\n52.Myersinvolved a federal statute that prohibited the\nPresident from removing certain postmasters except \u201cby and with the\nadvice and consent of the Senate.\u201dId., at 107 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). The question presented was \u201cwhether under\nthe Constitution the President has the exclusive power of removing\nexecutive officers of the United States whom he has appointed by\nand with the advice and consent of the Senate.\u201dId., at 106.\nIn a 70-page opinion by Chief Justice Taft, the Court held that the\nConstitution did vest such power in the President.The Court anchored its analysis in evidence from\nthe founding era. It acknowledged that the \u201csubject [of removal]\nwas not discussed in the Constitutional Convention,\u201did., at\n109\u2013110, but it reviewed in detail the First Congress\u2019 vigorous\ndebate about the removal of executive officers in what is known as\nthe Decision of 1789,id., at 111\u2013135.[1] In the course of analyzing the Decision of\n1789, the Court explained that Article II vests \u201cthe executive\npower of the Government .\u00a0.\u00a0. in one person\u201d\u2014the\nPresident\u2014and that the executive power includes the authority to\n\u201cselect those who [are] to act for him under his direction in the\nexecution of the laws.\u201dId., at 116\u2013117. Reiterating the\nposition of James Madison and other Members of the First Congress,\nthe Court noted that allowing limits on the President\u2019s removal\nauthority would grant Congress \u201cthe means of thwarting the\nExecutive in the exercise of his great powers and in the bearing of\nhis great responsibility, by fastening upon him, as subordinate\nexecutive officers, men who by their inefficient service under him,\nby their lack of loyalty to the service, or by their different\nviews of policy might make his taking care that the laws be\nfaithfully executed most difficult or impossible.\u201dId., at\n131. After \u201cdevot[ing] much space to [the] discussion and decision\nof the question of the Presidential power of removal in the First\nCongress\u201d as well as its understanding of the executive power,id., at 136, the Court concluded that \u201cthe power to remove\nofficers appointed by the President and the Senate vested in the\nPresident alone,\u201did., at 114. It repeatedly described this\nremoval power as \u201cunrestricted.\u201dId., at 115, 134, 150, 172,\n176.The Court noted that the First Congress\u2019\nunderstanding of the removal question was quickly \u201caccepted as a\nfinal decision of the question by all branches of the Government.\u201dId., at 136. The decision was \u201caffirmed by this Court in\nunmistakable terms.\u201dId., at 148, 152\u2013153 (discussingEx\nparte Hennen, 13 Pet. 230, 259 (1839);Parsonsv.United States,167 U.S.\n324, 330 (1897)). Presidents had \u201cuniform[ly]\u201d adopted the\nFirst Congress\u2019 view \u201cwhenever an issue ha[d] clearly been raised.\u201dMyers, 272 U.\u00a0S., at 169. And \u201cCongress, in a number of\nacts, followed and enforced the legislative decision of 1789 for\nseventy-four years.\u201dId., at 145. While disputes with\nPresident Andrew Johnson over Reconstruction led Congress to \u201cenact\nlegislation to curtail the then acknowledged powers of the\nPresident,\u201did., at 165, theMyersCourt declined to\ngive these politically charged acts any weight,id.,at\n175\u2013176.After exhaustively analyzing the historical\nevidence, the Court had \u201cno hesitation in holding that [the First\nCongress\u2019] conclusion [was] correct.\u201dId., at 176.Accordingly, the Court held that \u201cthe provision of the law [at\nissue], by which the unrestricted power of removal of first class\npostmasters is denied to the President, [was] in violation of the\nConstitution, and invalid.\u201dIbid.2Nine years afterMyers, the Court\ndecidedHumphrey\u2019s Executor. That case arose from the\nattempted removal of Commissioner William Humphrey from the Federal\nTrade Commission (FTC). In 1931, President Herbert Hoover appointed\nHumphrey to serve a 7-year term as one of the FTC\u2019s five\nCommissioners. By all accounts, Humphrey proved to be a\ncontroversial figure. See Crane, DebunkingHumphrey\u2019s\nExecutor, 83 Geo. Wash. L.\u00a0Rev. 1836, 1841 (2015);\nWinerman, The FTC at Ninety: History Through Headlines, 72\nAntitrust L.\u00a0J. 871, 878\u2013879 (2005); Yoo, Calabresi, &\nNee, The Unitary Executive During the Third Half-Century,\n1889\u20131945, 80 Notre Dame L. Rev. 1, 64 (2004). He reportedly \u201cvowed\nnot to approve any Commission action that did not have as its goal\nto help business help itself,\u201d \u201cthreaten[ed] criminal prosecution\nagainst other commissioners who publicly dissented,\u201d and \u201ccalled\nhis fellow commissioners men drunk with their own greatness\u201d when\nthey voted to initiate an investigation. Crane,supra, at\n1841 (internal quotation marks omitted).Less than two years into Humphrey\u2019s term, newly\ninaugurated President Franklin D. Roosevelt wrote Humphrey a\nletter, asking for his resignation. The President explained that,\nin his view, \u201cthe aims and purposes of the Administration with\nrespect to the work of the Commission [could] be carried out most\neffectively with personnel of [his] own selection.\u201dHumphrey\u2019s\nExecutor, 295 U.\u00a0S., at 618 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). A little over a month after his first letter, President\nRoosevelt wrote Humphrey again to ask for his resignation. The\nletter stated: \u201cYou will, I know, realize that I do not feel that\nyour mind and my mind go along together on either the policies or\nthe administering of the [FTC], and, frankly, I think it is best\nfor the people of this country that I should have a full\nconfidence.\u201dId., at 619 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nHumphrey declined to resign. In October 1933, President Roosevelt\ninformed Humphrey that he was removed from his position. Humphrey\ndid not comply, continuing \u201cto insist that he was still a member of\nthe commission, entitled to perform its duties and receive the\ncompensation provided by law.\u201dIbid.Four months later, Humphrey died. The executor\nof his estate brought suit in the Court of Claims, seeking to\nrecover Humphrey\u2019s salary from the date of his removal until the\ndate of his death. The Court of Claims certified two questions to\nthis Court: (1)\u00a0whether \u00a71 of the Federal Trade Commission Act\nof 1914, ch. 311, 38Stat. 717, prohibited the President from\nremoving FTC Commissioners except for \u201cinefficiency, neglect of\nduty, or malfeasance in office,\u201d and (2) if so, whether that\nrestriction was constitutional. 295 U.\u00a0S., at 619 (internal\nquotation marks omitted).The Court answered both of these questions in\nfavor of Humphrey\u2019s estate. It first held that the FTC Act\n\u201climit[ed] the executive power of removal to the causes enumerated\u201d\ntherein\u2014inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.Id., at 626. In the Court\u2019s view, this construction of the\nAct was clear from \u201cthe face of the statute\u201d and \u201cthe character of\nthe commission,\u201did., at 624, which the Court described as a\n\u201cbody of experts\u201d that operates \u201cindependent of executive authority\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. and free to exercise its judgment without the leave\nor hindrance of any other official,\u201did., at 625\u2013626.Then, notwithstanding the text of Article II of\nthe Constitution and the decision inMyers, the Court held\nthat the Act\u2019s restriction on the President\u2019s authority to remove\nCommissioners was constitutional. The Court acknowledged that the\n\u201crecently decided\u201dMyersdecision had \u201cfully review[ed] the\ngeneral subject of the power of executive removal\u201d and \u201cexamine[d]\nat length the historical, legislative and judicial data bearing\nupon the question.\u201dHumphrey\u2019s Executor, 295 U.\u00a0S., at\n626. And it conceded that executive officers are \u201csubject to the\nexclusive and illimitable power of removal by the Chief Executive.\u201dId., at 627; see alsoid., at 631 (recognizing \u201cthe\nPresident\u2019s illimitable power of removal\u201d over executive\nofficers).[2] The Court,\nhowever, claimed that \u201c[t]he office of a postmaster is so\nessentially unlike the office [of an FTC Commissioner] that the\ndecision in theMyerscase [could not] be accepted as\ncontrolling.\u201dId., at 627. In the Court\u2019s view, unlike the\npostmaster inMyers, FTC commissioners did not qualify as\n\u201cpurely executive officers.\u201d 295 U.\u00a0S., at 632.The Court grounded its analysis in its assertion\nthat the FTC \u201coccupies no place in the executive department and\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. exercises no part of the executive power vested by\nthe Constitution in the President.\u201dId., at 628. Rather, in\nthe Court\u2019s view, by \u201cfilling in and administering the details\nembodied by [the FTC Act\u2019s] general standard[,] the commission\nact[ed] in part quasi-legislatively and in part quasi-judicially.\u201dIbid.The Court stated that the FTC acted \u201cas a legislative\nagency\u201d by \u201cmaking investigations and reports thereon for the\ninformation of Congress\u201d and acted \u201cas an agency of the judiciary\u201d\nwhen performing its role \u201cas a master in chancery under rules\nprescribed by the court.\u201dIbid.\u201cSuch a body,\u201d the Court\nexplained, \u201ccannot in any proper sense be characterized as an arm\nor an eye of the executive.\u201dIbid.After distinguishing \u201cpurely executive officers\u201d\nfrom officers exercising \u201cquasi-legislative or quasi-judicial\npowers,\u201dibid., the Court held that \u201c[w]hether the power of\nthe President to remove an officer shall prevail over the authority\nof Congress to condition the power by .\u00a0. . precluding a\nremoval except for cause, will depend upon the character of the\noffice,\u201did., at 631. \u201c[P]urely executive officers\u201d are\nsubject to the President\u2019s \u201cunrestrictable power .\u00a0.\u00a0. to\nremove.\u201dId., at 632.But with regard to\n\u201cquasi-legislative\u201d and \u201cquasi-judicial\u201d officers, the Court\nconcluded that \u201cno removal [could] be made .\u00a0.\u00a0. except\nfor one or more of the causes named.\u201dIbid.3Humphrey\u2019s Executorlaid the foundation\nfor a fundamental departure from our constitutional structure with\nnothing more than handwaving and obfuscating phrases such as\n\u201cquasi-legislative\u201d and \u201cquasi-judicial.\u201d Unlike the thorough\nanalysis inMyers, the Court\u2019s thinly reasoned decision is\ncompletely \u201cdevoid of textual or historical precedent for the novel\nprinciple it set forth.\u201dMorrisonv.Olson,487\nU.S. 654, 726 (1988) (Scalia, J., dissenting). The exceptional\nweakness of the reasoning could be a product of the circumstances\nunder which the case was decided\u2014in the midst of a bitter standoff\nbetween the Court and President Roosevelt[3]\u2014or it could be just another example of this Court\ndeparting from the strictures of the Constitution for a \u201cmore\npragmatic, flexible approach\u201d to our government\u2019s design.Perez, 575 U.\u00a0S., at 116 (opinion of Thomas, J.)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). But whatever the motivation,Humphrey\u2019s Executordoes not comport with the\nConstitution.Humphrey\u2019s Executorrelies on one key\npremise: the notion that there is a category of \u201cquasi-legislative\u201d\nand \u201cquasi-judicial\u201d power that is not exercised by Congress or the\nJudiciary, but that is also not part of \u201cthe executive power vested\nby the Constitution in the President.\u201dHumphrey\u2019s Executor,supra, at 628. Working from that premise, the Court\ndistinguished the \u201cillimitable\u201d power of removal recognized inMyers,Humphrey\u2019s Executor, 295 U.\u00a0S., at\n627\u2013628, and upheld the FTC Act\u2019s removal restriction, while\nsimultaneously acknowledging that the Constitution vests the\nPresident with the entirety of the executive power,id., at\n628.The problem is that the Court\u2019s premise was\nentirely wrong. The Constitution does not permit the creation of\nofficers exercising \u201cquasi-legislative\u201d and \u201cquasi-judicial powers\u201d\nin \u201cquasi-legislative\u201d and \u201cquasi-judicial agencies.\u201dId.,at 628\u2013629.No such powers or agencies exist. Congress lacks\nthe authority to delegate its legislative power,Whitmanv.American Trucking Assns.,Inc.,531 U.S.\n457, 472 (2001), and it cannot authorize the use of judicial\npower by officers acting outside of the bounds of Article III,Sternv.Marshall,564 U.S.\n462, 484 (2011). Nor can Congress create agencies that straddle\nmultiple branches of Government. The Constitution sets out three\nbranches of Government and provides each with a different form of\npower\u2014legislative, executive, and judicial. See Art. I, \u00a71;\nArt.\u00a0II, \u00a71, cl.\u00a01; Art.\u00a0III, \u00a71. Free-floating\nagencies simply do not comport with this constitutional structure.\n\u201c[A]gencies have been called quasi-legislative, quasi-executive or\nquasi-judicial, as the occasion required, in order to validate\ntheir functions within the separation-of-powers scheme of the\nConstitution.\u201dFTCv.Ruberoid Co.,343 U.S.\n470, 487 (1952) (Jackson, J., dissenting). But \u201c[t]he mere\nretreat to the qualifying \u2018quasi\u2019 is implicit with confession that\nall recognized classifications have broken down, and \u2018quasi\u2019 is a\nsmooth cover which we draw over our confusion as we might use a\ncounterpane to conceal a disordered bed.\u201dId., at\n487\u2013488.That is exactly what happened inHumphrey\u2019s\nExecutor. The Court upheld the FTC Act\u2019s removal restriction by\nusing the \u201cquasi\u201d label to support its claim that the FTC\n\u201cexercise[d] no part of the executive power vested by the\nConstitution in the President.\u201dHumphrey\u2019s Executor,supra, at 628. But \u201cit is hard to dispute that the powers of\nthe FTC at the time ofHumphrey\u2019s Executorwould at the\npresent time be considered \u2018executive,\u2019 at least to some degree.\u201dMorrison,supra, at 690, n.\u00a028; seeante,\nat 14, n.\u00a02; seepost, at 18, n.\u00a07 (Kagan, J.,\nconcurring in judgment with respect to severability and dissenting\nin part).CToday\u2019s decision constitutes the latest in a\nseries of cases that have significantly underminedHumphrey\u2019s\nExecutor. First, inMorrison, the Court repudiated the\nreasoning of the decision. 487 U.\u00a0S., at 689. Then, inFree\nEnterprise Fund, we returned to the principles set out in the\n\u201clandmark case ofMyers.\u201d 561 U.\u00a0S., at 492. And today,\nthe Court rightfully limitsHumphrey\u2019s Executorto\n\u201cmultimember expert agencies that do not wield substantial\nexecutive power.\u201dAnte, at 16. After these decisions, the\nfoundation forHumphrey\u2019s Executoris not just shaky. It is\nnonexistent.This Court\u2019s repudiation ofHumphrey\u2019s\nExecutorbegan with its decision inMorrison. There, the\nCourt upheld a statute insulating an independent counsel from\nremoval by the Attorney General absent a showing of \u201cgood cause.\u201dMorrison,supra, at 659\u2013660. In doing so, the Court\nset aside the reasoning ofHumphrey\u2019s Executor. It\nrecognized thatHumphrey\u2019s Executor\u201crel[ied] on the terms\n\u2018quasi- legislative\u2019 and \u2018quasi-judicial\u2019 to distinguish the\nofficials involved inHumphrey\u2019s Executor.\u00a0.\u00a0.\nfrom those inMyers.\u201d 487 U.\u00a0S., at 689. But it then\nimmediately stated that its \u201cpresent considered view is that the\ndetermination of whether the Constitution allows Congress to impose\na \u2018good cause\u2019-type restriction on the President\u2019s power to remove\nan official cannot be made to turn on whether or not that official\nis classified as \u2018purely executive.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIbid.The Court\nalso rejectedHumphrey\u2019s Executor\u2019s conclusion that the FTC\ndid not exercise executive power, stating that \u201cthe powers of the\nFTC at the time ofHumphrey\u2019s Executorwould at the present\ntime be considered \u2018executive.\u2019\u00a0\u201dMorrison,supra, at 690, n.\u00a028. The lone dissenter, Justice\nScalia, disagreed with much of the Court\u2019s analysis but noted that\nthe Court had rightfully \u201cswept\u201dHumphrey\u2019s Executor\u201cinto\nthe dustbin of repudiated constitutional principles.\u201d 487\nU.\u00a0S., at 725. Thus, all nine Members of the Court inMorrisonrejected the core rationale ofHumphrey\u2019s\nExecutor.The reasoning of the Court\u2019s decision inFree\nEnterprise Fundcreated further tension (if not outright\nconflict) withHumphrey\u2019sExecutor. InFree\nEnterprise Fund, the Court concluded that a dual layer of\nfor-cause removal restrictions for members of the Public Company\nAccounting Oversight Board violated the Constitution. In its\nanalysis, the Court recognized that allowing officers to \u201cexecute\nthe laws\u201d beyond the President\u2019s control \u201cis contrary to Article\nII\u2019s vesting of the executive powerin the President.\u201d 561\nU.\u00a0S., at 496 (emphasis added). The Court acknowledged that\n\u201cthe executive power include[s] a power to oversee executive\nofficers through removal.\u201dId., at 492. And it explained\nthat, without the power of removal, the President cannot \u201cbe held\nfully accountable\u201d for the exercise of the executive power,\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018greatly diminish[ing] the intended and necessary\nresponsibility of the chief magistrate himself.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId.,\nat 514 (quoting The Federalist No. 70, p. 478 (J. Cooke ed. 1961)\n(A. Hamilton)). Accountability, the Court repeatedly emphasized,\nplays a central role in our constitutional structure. See,e.g.,Free Enterprise Fund, 561 U.\u00a0S.,at\n498 (\u201c[E]xecutive power without the Executive\u2019s oversight\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. subverts the President\u2019s ability to ensure that the\nlaws are faithfully executed\u2014as well as the public\u2019s ability to\npass judgment on his efforts\u201d);id., at 513 (\u201cThe\nConstitution that makes the President accountable to the people for\nexecuting the laws also gives him the power to do so\u201d).Humphrey\u2019s Executoris at odds with every single one of\nthese principles: It ignores Article II\u2019s Vesting Clause, sidesteps\nthe President\u2019s removal power, and encourages the exercise of\nexecutive power by unaccountable officers. The reasoning of the two\ndecisions simply cannot be reconciled.Finally, today\u2019s decision builds uponMorrisonandFree Enterprise Fund, further eroding\nthe foundation ofHumphrey\u2019s Executor. The Court correctly\nnotes that \u201c[t]he entire \u2018executive Power\u2019 belongs to the President\nalone.\u201dAnte, at 11. The President therefore must have\n\u201cpower to remove\u2014and thus supervise\u2014those who wield executive power\non his behalf.\u201dAnte, at 2. As a result, the Court concludes\nthatHumphrey\u2019s Executormust be limited to \u201cmultimember\nexpert agencies thatdo not wield substantial executive\npower.\u201dAnte,at 16 (emphasis added). And, at the same\ntime, it recognizes (as the Court did inMorrison) that\n\u201c[t]he Court\u2019s conclusion that the FTC did not exercise executive\npower has not withstood the test of time.\u201dAnte, at 14,\nn.\u00a02. In other words,Humphrey\u2019s Executordoes not even\nsatisfy its own exception.In light of these decisions, it is not clear\nwhat is left ofHumphrey\u2019s Executor\u2019s rationale.[4] But if any remnant of that decision\nis still standing, it certainly is not enough to justify the\nnumerous, unaccountable independent agencies that currently\nexercise vast executive power outside the bounds of our\nconstitutional structure.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*Continued reliance onHumphrey\u2019s\nExecutorto justify the existence of independent agencies\ncreates a serious, ongoing threat to our Government\u2019s design.\nLeaving these unconstitutional agencies in place does not enhance\nthis Court\u2019s legitimacy; it subverts political accountability and\nthreatens individual liberty.

Walsh,supra, at 777.Our modern severability precedents create\ntension with this historic practice. Instead of declining to\nenforce an unconstitutional statute in an individual case, this\nCourt has stated that courts must \u201cseve[r] and excis[e]\u201d portions\nof a statute to \u201cremedy\u201d the constitutional problem.United\nStatesv.Booker,543 U.S.\n220, 245 (2005);Alaska Airlines,Inc.v.Brock,480 U.S.\n678, 686 (1987). The Court\u2019s rhetoric when discussing severance\nimplies that a court\u2019s decision to sever a provision \u201cformally\nsuspend[s] or erase[s it], when [the provision] actually remains on\nthe books as a law.\u201d Mitchell,supra, at 1017. The Federal\nJudiciary does not have the power to excise, erase, alter, or\notherwise strike down a statute.Murphy,supra, at\n___ (Thomas, J., concurring) (slip op., at 4); Mitchell,supra, at 936. And the Court\u2019s reference to severability as\na \u201cremedy\u201d is inaccurate. Traditional remedies\u2014like injunctions,\ndeclarations, or damages\u2014\u201c\u00a0\u2018operate with respect to specific\nparties,\u2019 not \u2018on legal rules in the abstract.\u2019\u00a0\u201dMurphy,supra, at ___ (Thomas, J., concurring) (slip\nop., at 3) (quoting Harrison, Severability, Remedies, and\nConstitutional Adjudication, 83 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 56, 85\n(2014)).Because the power of judicial review does not\nallow courts to revise statutes, Mitchell,supra, at 983,\nthe Court\u2019s severability doctrine must be rooted in statutory\ninterpretation. But, even viewing severability as an interpretive\nquestion, I remain skeptical of our doctrine. As I have previously\nexplained, \u201cthe severability doctrine often requires courts to\nweigh in on statutory provisions that no party has standing to\nchallenge, bringing courts dangerously close to issuing advisory\nopinions.\u201dMurphy, 584 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (concurring\nopinion) (slip op., at 5). And the application of the doctrine\n\u201cdoes not follow basic principles of statutory interpretation.\u201dId., at ___ (slip op., at 4).Instead of determining\nthe meaning of a statute\u2019s text, severability involves \u201cnebulous\ninquir[ies] into hypothetical congressional intent.\u201dBooker,supra,at 320, n.\u00a07 (Thomas, J., dissenting in\npart).BConsistent with the traditional understanding\nof the judicial power, I would deny CFPB\u2019s petition to enforce the\ncivil investigative demand that it issued to Seila. See\n\u00a75562(e)(1). Seila \u201cchallenge[d] the validity of both the civil\ninvestigative demand and the ensuing enforcement action.\u201d Reply\nBrief for Petitioner 5. Seila has not countersued or sought\naffirmative relief preventing the CFPB from acting in the future;\nit simply asks us to \u201creverse the court of appeals\u2019 judgment.\u201d\nBrief for Petitioner 35. I would do just that. As the Court\nrecognizes, the enforcement of a civil investigative demand by an\nofficial with unconstitutional removal protection injures Seila.\nSeeante, at 9\u201310. Presented with an enforcement request\nfrom an unconstitutionally insulated Director, I would simply deny\nthe CFPB\u2019s petition for an order of enforcement. This approach\nwould resolve the dispute before us without addressing the issue of\nseverability.The Court, however, does more. In the\nplurality\u2019s view,[5] because\nthe CFPB raised a ratification argument before the Court of\nAppeals, we can (and should) reach the question of severability.\nSeeante, at 30\u201331. But as explained more fully below,\nresolving this question is wholly unnecessary. Regardless of\nwhether the CFPB\u2019s ratification theory is valid, the Court of\nAppeals on remand must reach the same outcome: The CFPB\u2019s civil\ninvestigative demand cannot be enforced against Seila.The ratification argument presented by the CFPB\nis quite simple. Since its creation in 2010, the CFPB has had three\nDirectors\u2014first Director Richard Cordray, then Acting Director Mick\nMulvaney, and now Director Kathleen Kraninger. The CFPB\u2019s first\nDirector, Director Cordray, issued a civil investigative demand to\nSeila and initiated the enforcement action. The CFPB has conceded\nthat these actions were unconstitutional. But, in the Ninth\nCircuit, the CFPB argued that the investigative demand was ratified\nby Acting Director Mulvaney, who it claimed wasnotinsulated by the removal provision. Brief for Appellee in No.\n17\u201356324, pp.\u00a013\u201319. In the CFPB\u2019s view, the President could\nremove Acting Director Mulvaney at will because the \u201cremoval\nprovision by its terms applies only to \u2018the Director,\u2019 not to an\nActing Director,\u201d and the Federal Vacancy Reform Act \u201cdoes not\nlimit the President\u2019s ability to designate a different person as\nActing Director.\u201dId., at\u00a014. Based on this\nratification theory, the CFPB asked the Ninth Circuit to affirm the\nDistrict Court\u2019s order granting the CFPB\u2019s petition to enforce its\ninvestigative demand.The CFPB does not ask this Court to address\nratification on the merits, but it does rely on its unresolved\nratification theory to assert that the Court should reach\nseverability. In doing so, the CFPB relies on the same theory that\nit presented to the Ninth Circuit. Thus, the only live ratification\nclaim is the theory that Acting Director Mulvaney ratified the\ncivil investigative demand. Seeante, at 30\u201331.[6]The resolution of the CFPB\u2019s Acting-Director\nratification theory, however, has no bearing on the outcome of the\ndispute before us and therefore provides no basis for addressing\nseverability. If the Acting Director did not ratify the\ninvestigative demand, then there is obviously no need to address\nseverability. And even if he did, the Court still does not need to\naddress severability because the alleged ratification does not cure\nthe constitutional injury\u2014enforcement of an investigative demand by\nan unconstitutionally insulated Director. Seila \u201cchallenge[d] the\nvalidity of both the civil investigative demandand the ensuing\nenforcement action.\u201d Reply Brief for Petitioner 5 (emphasis\nadded). Acting Director Mulvaney may (or may not) have properly\nratified the issuance of the investigative demand and the\ninitiation of the enforcement proceedings. But he certainly could\nnot ratify the continuance of the enforcement action by his\nsuccessor, Director Kraninger.Id., at 7. Thus, even if the\nCFPB\u2019s ratification theory is valid, Seila still has an injury: It\nhas been (and continues to be) subjected to enforcement of an\ninvestigative demand by Director Kraninger, who \u201cremains\nstatutorily insulated from removal.\u201d Reply Brief for Respondent 7;\nsee alsoFree Enterprise Fund, 561 U.\u00a0S., at 513;ante, at 10. Thus, we should decline to enforce the civil\ninvestigative demand against Seila. Seesupra,at 14\u201315.Ultimately, I cannot see how the resolution of\nthe severability question affects the dispute before us. And even\nif severability could affect this case in some hypothetical\nscenario, I would not reach out to resolve the issue given my\ngrowing discomfort with our current severability precedents.CConfident that it can address the question of\nseverability, the plurality moves on to conduct its analysis. It\nstarts by pointing to the severability clause in the Dodd-Frank\nAct. Seeante, at 33. That clause states: \u201cIf any provision\nof this Act, an amendment made by this Act, or the application of\nsuch provision or amendment to any person or circumstance is held\nto be unconstitutional, the remainder of this Act, the amendments\nmade by this Act, and the application of the provisions of such to\nany person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby.\u201d \u00a75302.\nThe plurality states that \u201c[i]f the Director were removable at will\nby the President, the constitutional violation would disappear.\u201dAnte, at 32\u201333. Then, relying on language in the\nseverability clause, it concludes that the removal provision,\n\u00a75491(c)(3), should be severed.The plurality suggests that its analysis is a\nmatter of simply enforcing the \u201cplain language\u201d of the severability\nclause. Seeante, at 33. But I am not sure it is that\nsimple. For one, the plurality does not actually analyze the\nstatutory language.[7] Second,\nthe analysis the plurality does provide looks nothing like\ntraditional statutory interpretation. Generally, when we interpret\na statute, we do not hold that the text sets out a \u201cpresum[ption]\u201d\nthat can be rebutted by looking to atextual evidence of legislative\nintent.Ante, at 32. A text-based interpretation does not\nallow a free-ranging inquiry into what \u201c\u00a0\u2018Congress, faced with\nthe limitations imposed by the Constitution, would have\npreferred\u2019\u00a0\u201d had it known of a constitutional issue.Ante, at 33 (quotingFree Enterprise Fund,supra, at 509). Nor does it consider whether Congress would\nhave wanted to avoid \u201ca major regulatory disruption.\u201dAnte,\nat 35. Statutory interpretation focuses on the text.Even treating the question as a matter of pure\nstatutory interpretation and assuming that the plurality points to\nthe correct language, the text of the severability clause cannot,\nin isolation, justify severance of the removal provision. In some\ninstances, a constitutional injury arises as a result of two or\nmore statutory provisions operating together. See,e.g.,Free Enterprise Fund,supra, at 509 (stating that the\nconvergence of \u201ca number of statutory provisions\u201d produce a\nconstitutional violation);Booker, 543 U.\u00a0S., at\n316\u2013317 (opinion of Thomas, J.) (explaining that \u201cthe concerted\naction of [18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.] \u00a73553(b)(1)andthe\noperative Guidelinesandthe relevant Rule of Criminal\nProcedure resulted in unconstitutional judicial factfinding\u201d); Lea,\nSituation Severability, 103 Va. L.\u00a0Rev. 735, 778\u2013780 (2017)\n(discussing statutory convergences). That is precisely the\nsituation we have in this case. As inFree Enterprise Fund,\nthe provision requiring \u201cgood-cause removal is only one of [the]\nstatutory provisions that, working together, produce a\nconstitutional violation.\u201d 561 U.\u00a0S., at 509. The\nconstitutional violation results from, at a minimum, the\ncombination of the removal provision, 12 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a75491(c)(3), and the provision allowing the CFPB to seek\nenforcement of a civil investigative demand, \u00a75562(e)(1). When\nconfronted with two provisions that operate together to violate the\nConstitution, the text of the severability clause provides no\nguidance as towhichprovision should be severed. Thus, we\nmust choose, based on something other than the severability clause,\nwhich provision to sever.Without text to guide us, the severability\ninquiry moves away from statutory interpretation and falls back on\nthis Court\u2019s questionable precedents. SeeMurphy, 584\nU.\u00a0S., at ___\u2013___ (Thomas, J., concurring) (slip op., at 4\u20136).\nAn analysis of the Court\u2019s decisions inBookerandFree\nEnterprise Fundillustrates the Court\u2019s approach to determining\nwhich provision to sever when confronting an injury caused by an\nunconstitutional convergence of multiple statutory provisions.InBooker, a Rule of Criminal Procedure,\na subset of provisions in the Sentencing Guidelines, and a\nstatutory provision operated together to require unconstitutional\njudicial factfinding. To determine which aspect of the sentencing\nscheme to sever, the Court sought to divine \u201cwhat Congress would\nhave intended in light of the Court\u2019s constitutional holding.\u201dBooker, 543 U.\u00a0S., at 246 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). The Court \u201crecognize[d] that sometimes severability\nquestions .\u00a0.\u00a0. can arise [in the context of] a\nlegislatively unforeseen constitutional problem.\u201dId., at\n247. But it nonetheless felt qualified to craft a remedy that would\n\u201cmove sentencing in Congress\u2019 preferred direction.\u201dId., at\n264. Surprisingly, that \u201cmove\u201d did not involve enforcing the\nconstitutional aspects of Congress\u2019 sentencing scheme. The Court\nstated that \u201cwe cannot assume that Congress, if faced with the\nstatute\u2019s invalidity in key applications, would have preferred to\napply the statute in as many other instances as possible.\u201dId., at 248.[8] Despite\nthe fact that there were a plethora of cases in which mandatory\nSentencing Guidelines would have posed no constitutional problem,\nthe Court decided to \u201csever and excise .\u00a0.\u00a0. the\nprovision that requires sentencing courts to impose a sentence\nwithin the applicable Guidelines range,\u201d along with another\nprovision which was not even at issue in the case.Id., at\n259. In essence, the Court crafted a new sentencing scheme,\ntransforming the Sentencing Guidelines into an entirely\ndiscretionary system based on its estimation that Congress would\nhave wanted that result.The Court inFree Enterprise Funddeclined to explicitly engage inBooker\u2019s free-wheeling\ninquiry into Congress\u2019 hypothetical preferences, but it did not\nreplace that inquiry with a clear standard. In that case, the Court\nheld that a \u201cnumber of statutory provisions .\u00a0.\u00a0. ,\nworking together, produce[d] a constitutional violation\u201d similar to\nthe violation at issue here.Free Enterprise Fund, 561\nU.\u00a0S., at 509. The Court decided to sever the Board\u2019s removal\nrestriction. It explicitly recognized that there were multiple ways\nto address the constitutional injury, stating that the Court could,\nfor example, \u201cblue-pencil a sufficient number of the Board\u2019s\nresponsibilities,\u201d or \u201crestrict the Board\u2019s enforcement powers.\u201dIbid.But it described these alternative options as\ninvolving \u201ceditorial freedom\u2014far more extensive than [the] holding\ntoday\u2014[that] belongs to the Legislature, not the Judiciary.\u201dId., at 510. The Court did not explain, however, why the\noption that it chose was not also \u201ceditorial freedom\u201d that belongs\nto the Legislature or why the alternatives involved \u201cmore\nextensive\u201d \u201ceditorial freedom\u201d than its preferred option.Ibid.The most that the Court provided was a suggestion that\nfewer provisions would have to be severed under its approach.Id., at 509\u2013510.Today\u2019s plurality opinion provides no further\nguidance. In fact, the plurality does not even recognize that it\nhas made a choice between the provisions that cause the\nconstitutional injury. It merely states that \u201c[i]f the Director\nwere removable at will by the President, the constitutional\nviolation would disappear.\u201dAnte, at 32\u201333. Fair enough. But\nif the Director lacked executive authority under the statute to\nseek enforcement of a civil investigative demand, \u00a75562(e)(1), the\nconstitutional violation in this case would also disappear. The\nplurality thuschooseswhich of the provisions to sever.In short, when multiple provisions of law\ncombine to cause a constitutional injury, the Court\u2019s current\napproach allows the Court to decide which provision to sever. The\ntext of a severability clause does not guide that choice. Nor does\nthe practice of early American courts. Seesupra, at 14\u201315.\nThe Court is thus left to choose based on nothing more than\nspeculation as to what the Legislature would have preferred. And\nthe result of its choice can have a dramatic effect on the\ngoverning statutory scheme. SeeBooker,supra, at 259\n(converting the entirety of the Sentencing Guidelines from a\nmandatory to a discretionary system). This is not a simple matter\nof following the \u201cplain language\u201d of a statute.Ante, at 33.\nIt is incumbent on us to take a close look at our precedents to\nmake sure that we are not exceeding the scope of the judicial\npower.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*Given my concerns about our modern\nseverability doctrine and the fact that severability makes no\ndifference to the dispute before us, I would resolve this case by\nsimply denying the CFPB\u2019s petition to enforce the civil\ninvestigative demand.Notes1For a comprehensive\nreview of the Decision of 1789, see Prakash, New Light on the\nDecision of 1789, 91 Cornell L.\u00a0Rev. 1021 (2006).2The explicit and repeated\nrecognition of the President\u2019s \u201cillimitable power\u201d inHumphrey\u2019s\nExecutorhighlights the dissent\u2019s error in claiming thatHumphrey\u2019s Executor\u201cabandoned [the] view\u201d set out inMyersv.United States,272 U.S.\n52(1926).Post, at 17 (Kagan, J., concurring in\njudgment with respect to severability and dissenting in part)\n(hereinafter dissent).Humphrey\u2019s Executordid not abandonMyers; it distinguishedMyersbased on the flawed\npremise that the FTC exercised \u201cquasi-legislative\u201d and\n\u201cquasi-judicial\u201d power that is not part of \u201cthe executive power\nvested by the Constitution in the President.\u201dHumphrey\u2019s\nExecutor, 295 U.\u00a0S., at 628; see alsoinfra, at\n9\u201311.3A number of historical\nsources indicate that President Roosevelt sawHumphrey\u2019s\nExecutorv.United States,295 U.S.\n602(1935), as an attack on his administration. Given the\nCourt\u2019s recent decision inMyers, the Roosevelt\nadministration was reportedly \u201cstunned\u201d by the Court\u2019s decision inHumphrey\u2019s Executor, and the President was particularly\nannoyed that the decision \u201cma[de] it appear that he had been\nwillfully violating the Constitution.\u201d See W.

Justice Jackson, who was serving in\nthe Roosevelt administration at the time, stated in an interview\nthat \u201c\u00a0\u2018the decision that made Roosevelt madder at the Court\nthan any other decision was that .\u00a0.\u00a0. little case ofHumphrey\u2019s Executorv.United States.

But, as discussed below, there is no\nsingle \u201cprovision\u201d of the Act that has led to the constitutional\ninjury in this case. Seeinfra, at 20\u201321. It is the\nattempted enforcement of a civil investigative demand under\n\u00a75562(e)(1) by an unconstitutionally insulated Director that causes\nthe constitutional injury in this case. There is at least a\nnonfrivolous argument that this case implicates the third scenario\ncontemplated by the severability clause\u2014i.e.,\u201cthe\napplication of [a] provision\u201d in a certain \u201ccircumstance.\u201d \u00a75302.\nIf that were so, the text of the severability clause would not\nrequire any \u201cprovision\u201d to be severed; the unconstitutional\napplication of \u00a75562(e)(1) simply would not affect other provisions\nof the Dodd-Frank Act. Such a reading would be consistent with the\ntraditional limits on the judicial power. Seesupra, at\n14\u201315.8This statement inBookeris irreconcilable with the plurality\u2019s assertion here\nthat \u201cCongress would prefer that we use a scalpel rather than a\nbulldozer in curing the constitutional defect.\u201dAnte,at 35.\nThus, it appears that the plurality eithersub silentio\u201cjunk[s] our settled severability doctrine,\u201dibid., or\ninvokes, without explanation, different assumptions for different\ncases.",
