LUCIA, et\u00a0al., PETITIONERSv.SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSIONon writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the district of columbia circuit[June 21, 2018]Justice Sotomayor, with whom Justice Ginsburg\njoins, dissenting.The Court today and scholars acknowledge that\nthis Court\u2019s Appointments Clause jurisprudence offers little\nguidance on who qualifies as an \u201cOfficer of the United States.\u201d\nSee,e.g.,ante,at 6 (\u201cThe standard is no doubt\nframed in general terms, tempting advocates to add whatever glosses\nbest suit their arguments\u201d); Plecnik, Officers Under the\nAppointments Clause, 11 Pitt. Tax Rev. 201, 204 (2014). The lack of\nguidance is not without consequence. \u201c[Q]uestions about the Clause\ncontinue to arise regularly both in the operation of the Executive\nBranch and in proposed legislation.\u201d 31 Opinion of Office of Legal\nCounsel 73, 76 (2007) (Op. OLC). This confusion can undermine the\nreliability and finality of proceedings and result in wasted\nresources. Seeante,at 12\u201313 (opinion of the Court)\n(ordering the Commission to grant petitioners a new administrative\nhearing).As the majority notes, seeante,at 5\u20136,\nthis Court\u2019s decisions currently set forth at least two\nprerequisites to officer status: (1) an individual must hold a\n\u201ccontinuing\u201d office established by law,United Statesv.Germaine, 99 U.\u00a0S. 508, 511\u2013512 (1879), and (2) an\nindividual must wield \u201csignificant authority,\u201dBuckleyv.Valeo, 424 U.\u00a0S. 1, 126 (1976) (per curiam). The\nfirst requirement is relatively easy to grasp; the second, less so.\nTo be sure, to exercise \u201csignificant authority,\u201d the person must\nwield considerable powers in comparison to the average person who\nworks for the Federal Government. As this Court has noted, the vast\nmajority of those who work for the Federal Government are not\n\u201cOfficers of the United States.\u201d SeeFree Enterprise Fundv.Public Company Accounting Oversight Bd., 561 U.\u00a0S. 477,\n506, n. 9 (2010) (indicating that well over 90% of those who render\nservices to the Federal Government and are paid by it are not\nconstitutional officers). But this Court\u2019s decisions have yet to\narticulate the types of powers that will be deemed significant\nenough to constitute \u201csignificant authority.\u201dTo provide guidance to Congress and the\nExecutive Branch, I would hold that one requisite component of\n\u201csignificant authority\u201d is the ability to make final, binding\ndecisions on behalf of the Government. Accordingly, a person who\nmerely advises and provides recommendations to an officer would not\nherself qualify as an officer.There is some historical support for such a\nrequirement. For example, in 1822, the Supreme Judicial Court of\nMaine opined in the \u201cfullest early explication\u201d of the meaning of\nan \u201c\u00a0\u2018office,\u2019\u00a0\u201d that \u201c\u00a0\u2018the term \u201coffice\u201d implies a\ndelegation of a portion of the sovereign power to, and possession\nof it by the person filling the office,\u2019\u00a0\u201d that \u201c\u00a0\u2018in its\neffects[,] .\u00a0.\u00a0. will bind the rights of others.\u2019\u00a0\u201d\n31 Op. OLC 83 (quoting 3 Greenl. (Me.) 481, 482). In 1899, a Report\nof the Judiciary Committee of the House of Representatives noted\nthat \u201cthe creation and conferring of an office involves a\ndelegation to the individual of .\u00a0.\u00a0. sovereign\nfunctions,\u201di.e.,\u201cthe power to .\u00a0.\u00a0. legislate,\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. execute law, or .\u00a0.\u00a0. hear and determine\njudicially questions submitted.\u201d 1 A. Hinds, Precedents of the\nHouse of Representatives of the United States 607 (1907). Those who\nmerely assist others in exercising sovereign functions but who do\nnot have the authority to exercise sovereign powers themselves do\nnot wield significant authority.Id.,at 607\u2013608.\nConsequently, a person who possesses the \u201cmere power to investigate\nsome particular subject and report thereon\u201d or to engage in\nnegotiations \u201cwithout [the] power to make binding\u201d commitments on\nbehalf of the Government is not an officer.Ibid.Confirming that final decisionmaking authority\nis a prerequisite to officer status would go a long way to aiding\nCongress and the Executive Branch in sorting out who is an officer\nand who is a mere employee. At the threshold, Congress and the\nExecutive Branch could rule out as an officer any person who\ninvestigates, advises, or recommends, but who has no power to issue\nbinding policies, execute the laws, or finally resolve adjudicatory\nquestions.Turning to the question presented here, it is\ntrue that the administrative law judges (ALJs) of the Securities\nand Exchange Commission wield \u201cextensive powers.\u201dAnte,at\n2. They preside over adversarial proceedings that can lead to the\nimposition of significant penalties on private parties. Seeante,at 2\u20133 (noting that the proceedings in the present\ncase resulted in the imposition of $300,000 in civil penalties, as\nwell as a lifetime bar from the investment industry). In the\nhearings over which they preside, Commission ALJs also exercise\ndiscretion with respect to important matters. Seeante,at 2\n(discussing Commission ALJs\u2019 powers to supervise discovery, issue\nsubpoenas, rule on the admissibility of evidence, hear and examine\nwitnesses, and regulate the course of the proceedings).Nevertheless, I would hold that Commission ALJs\nare not officers because they lack final decisionmaking authority.\nAs the Commission explained below, the Commission retains\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018plenary authority over the course of [its] administrative\nproceedings and the rulings of [its] law judges.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIn re\nRaymond J. Lucia Companies, Inc. & Raymond J. Lucia, Sr.,\nSEC Release No. 75837 (Sept. 3, 2015). Commission ALJs can issue\nonly \u201cinitial\u201d decisions. 5 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7557(b). The\nCommission can review any initial decision upon petition or on its\nown initiative. 15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a778d\u20131(b). The Commission\u2019s\nreview of an ALJ\u2019s initial decision isde\u00a0novo. 5\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7557(c). It can \u201cmake any findings or\nconclusions that in its judgment are proper and on the basis of the\nrecord.\u201d 17 CFR \u00a7201.411(a) (2017). The Commission is also in no\nway confined by the record initially developed by an ALJ. The\nCommission can accept evidence itself or refer a matter to an ALJ\nto take additional evidence that the Commission deems relevant or\nnecessary. Seeibid.; \u00a7201.452. In recent years, the\nCommission has accepted review in every case in which it was\nsought. See R. Jackson, Fact and Fiction: The SEC\u2019s Oversight of\nAdministrative Law Judges (Mar. 9, 2018),\nhttp://clsbluesky.law.columbia.edu/2018/03/09/fact-and-fiction-\nthe-secs-oversight-of-administrative-law-judges/ (as last visited\nJune 19, 2018). Even where the Commission does not review an ALJ\u2019s\ninitial decision, as in cases in which no party petitions for\nreview and the Commission does not actsua sponte, the\ninitial decision still only becomes final when the Commission\nenters a finality order. 17 CFR. \u00a7201.360(d)(2). And by operation\nof law, every action taken by an ALJ \u201cshall, for all purposes,\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. be deemed the action of theCommission.\u201d 15\nU. S. C. \u00a778d\u20131(c) (emphasis added). In other words, Commission\nALJs do not exercise significant authority because they do not, and\ncannot, enter final, binding decisions against the Government or\nthird parties.The majority concludes that this case is\ncontrolled byFreytagv.Commissioner, 501 U.\u00a0S.\n868 (1991). Seeante,at 6. InFreytag, the\nCourt suggested that the Tax Court\u2019s special trial judges (STJs)\nacted as constitutional officers even in cases where they could not\nenter final, binding decisions. In such cases, the Court noted, the\nSTJs presided over adversarial proceedings in which they exercised\n\u201csignificant discretion\u201d with respect to \u201cimportant functions,\u201d\nsuch as ruling on the admissibility of evidence and hearing and\nexamining witnesses.\u00a0\u00a0501 U.\u00a0S.,at\n881\u2013882. That part of the opinion, however, was unnecessary to the\nresult. The Court went on to conclude that even if the STJs\u2019 duties\nin such cases were \u201cnot as significant as [the Court] found them to\nbe,\u201d its conclusion \u201cwould be unchanged.\u201dId.,at 882. The\nCourt noted that STJs could enter final decisions in certain types\nof cases, and that the Government had conceded that the STJs acted\nas officers with respect to those proceedings.Ibid.Because\nSTJs could not be \u201cofficers for purposes of some of their duties\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. , but mere employees with respect to\nother[s],\u201dthe Court held they were officers in all\nrespects.Ibid. Freytagis, therefore, consistent with a\nrule that a prerequisite to officer status is the authority, in at\nleast some instances, to issue final decisions that bind the\nGovernment or third parties.[1]Because I would conclude that Commission ALJs\nare not officers for purposes of the Appointments Clause, it is not\nnecessary to reach the constitutionality of their removal\nprotections. Seeante,at 1 (Breyer, J., concurring in\njudgment in part and dissenting in part). In any event, for at\nleast the reasons stated in Justice Breyer\u2019s opinion,Free\nEnterprise Fundis readily distinguishable from the\ncircumstances at play here. Seeante,at 3\u20139.As a final matter, although I would conclude\nthat Commission ALJs are not officers, I share Justice Breyer\u2019s\nconcerns regarding the Court\u2019s choice of remedy, and so I join Part\nIII of his opinion.For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully\ndissent.Notes1Even the majority opinion\nis not inconsistent with such a rule, in that it appears to\nconclude, wrongly in my view, that Commission ALJs can at times\nrender final decisions. Seeante,at 10.",
