    "text": "OPINION OF THE COURTSMITH V. BAYER CORP.564 U. S. ____ (2011)SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESNO. 09-1205KEITH SMITH, et\u00a0al., PETITIONERSv.BAYER CORPORATIONon writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the eighth circuit[June 16, 2011]Justice Kagan delivered the\nopinion of the Court.*In this case, a Federal District\nCourt enjoined a state court from considering a plaintiff\u2019s request\nto approve a class action. The District Court did so because it had\nearlier denied a motion to certify a class in a related case,\nbrought by a different plaintiff against the same defendant\nalleging similar claims. The federal court thought its injunction\nappropriate to prevent relitigation of the issue it had\ndecided.We hold to the contrary. In issuing this order\nto a state court, the federal court exceeded its authority under\nthe \u201crelitigation exception\u201d to the Anti-Injunction Act. That\nstatutory provision permits a federal court to enjoin a state\nproceeding only in rare cases, when necessary to \u201cpro-tect or\neffectuate [the federal court\u2019s] judgments.\u201d 28 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a72283. Here, that standard was not met for two reasons. First, the\nissue presented in the state court was not identical to the one\ndecided in the federal tribunal. And second, the plaintiff in the\nstate court did not have the requisite connection to the federal\nsuit to be bound by the District Court\u2019s judgment.IBecause the question before us\ninvolves the effect of a former adjudication on this case, we begin\nour statement of the facts not with this lawsuit, but with another.\nIn August 2001, George McCollins sued respondent Bayer Corporation\nin the Circuit Court of Cabell County, West Virginia, asserting\nvarious state-law claims arising from Bayer\u2019s sale of an allegedly\nhazardous prescription drug called Baycol (which Bayer withdrew\nfrom the market that same month). McCollins contended that Bayer\nhad violated West Virginia\u2019s consumer-protection statute and the\ncompany\u2019s express and implied warranties by selling him a defective\nproduct. And pursuant to West Virginia Rule of Civil Procedure 23\n(2011), McCollins asked the state court to certify a class of West\nVirginia residents who had also purchased Baycol, so that the case\ncould proceed as a class action.Approximately one month later,\nthe suit now before us began in a different part of West Virginia.\nPetitioners Keith Smith and Shirley Sperlazza (Smith for short)\nfiled state-law claims against Bayer, similar to those raised in\nMcCollins\u2019 suit, in the Circuit Court of Brooke County, West\nVirginia. And like McCollins, Smith asked the court to certify\nunder West Virginia\u2019s Rule 23 a class of Baycol purchasers residing\nin the State. Neither Smith nor McCollins knew about the other\u2019s\nsuit.In January 2002, Bayer removed McCollins\u2019 case\nto the United States District Court for the Southern District of\nWest Virginia on the basis of diversity jurisdiction. See 28 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a71332, 1441. The case was then transferred to the\nDistrict of Minnesota pursuant to a preexisting order of the\nJudicial Panel on Multi-District Litigation, which had consolidated\nall federal suits involving Baycol (numbering in the tens of\nthousands) before a single District Court Judge. See \u00a71407. Bayer,\nhowever, could not remove Smith\u2019s case to federal court because\nSmith had sued several West Virginia defendants in addition to\nBayer, and so the suit lacked complete diversity. See\n\u00a71441(b).[Footnote 1] Smith\u2019s\nsuit thus remained in the state courthouse in Brooke County.Over the next six years, the two cases\nproceeded along their separate pretrial paths at roughly the same\npace. By 2008, both courts were preparing to turn to their\nrespective plaintiffs\u2019 motions for class certification. The Federal\nDistrict Court was the first to reach a decision.Applying Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n23,[Footnote 2] the District\nCourt declined to certify McCollins\u2019 proposed class of West\nVirginia Baycol purchasers. The District Court\u2019s reasoning\nproceeded in two steps. The court first ruled that, under West\nVirginia law, each plaintiff would have to prove \u201cactual injury\u201d\nfrom his use of Baycol to recover. App. to Pet. for Cert. 44a. The\ncourt then held that because the necessary showing of harm would\nvary from plaintiff to plaintiff, \u201cindividual issues of fact\npredominate[d]\u201d over issues common to all members of the proposed\nclass, and so the case was not suitable for class treatment.Id.,at 45a. In the same order, the District Court also\ndismissed McCollins\u2019 claims on the merits in light of his failure\nto demonstrate physical injury from his use of Baycol. McCollins\nchose not to appeal.Although McCollins\u2019 suit was now concluded,\nBayer asked the District Court for another order based upon it,\nthis one affecting Smith\u2019s case in West Virginia. In a\nmotion\u2014receipt of which first apprised Smith of McCollins\u2019\nsuit\u2014Bayer explained that the proposed class in Smith\u2019s case was\nidentical to the one the federal court had just rejected. Bayer\ntherefore requested that the federal court enjoin the West Virginia\nstate court from hearing Smith\u2019s motion to certify a class.\nAccording to Bayer, that order was appropriate to protect the\nDistrict Court\u2019s judgment in McCollins\u2019 suit denying class\ncertification. The District Court agreed and granted the\ninjunction.The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit\naffirmed.In\u00a0re Baycol Prods. Litigation,593\nF.\u00a03d 716 (2010). The court noted that the Anti-Injunction Act\ngenerally prohibits federal courts from enjoining state court\nproceedings. But the court held that the Act\u2019s relitigation\nexception authorized the injunction here because ordinary rules of\nissue preclusion barred Smith from seeking certification of his\nproposed class. According to the court, Smith was invoking a\nsimilar class action rule as McCollins had used to seek\ncertification \u201cof the same class\u201d in a suit alleging \u201cthe same\nlegal theories,\u201did., at 724; the issue in the state court\ntherefore was \u201csufficiently identical\u201d to the one the federal court\nhad decided to warrant preclusion,ibid. In addition, the\ncourt held, the parties in the two proceedings were sufficiently\nalike: Because Smith was an unnamed member of the class McCollins\nhad proposed, and because their \u201cinterests were aligned,\u201d Smith was\nappropriately bound by the federal court\u2019s judgment.Ibid.We granted certiorari, 561 U. S. __ (2010),\nbecause the order issued here implicates two circuit splits arising\nfrom application of the Anti-Injunction Act\u2019s relitigation\nexception. The first involves the requirement of preclusion law\nthat a subsequent suit raise the \u201csame issue\u201d as a previous\ncase.[Footnote 3] The second\nconcerns the scope of the rule that a court\u2019s judgment cannot bind\nnonparties.[Footnote 4] We\nthink the District Court erred on both grounds when it granted the\ninjunction, and we now reverse.IIThe Anti-Injunction Act, first\nenacted in 1793, provides that\u201cA court of the United States may not grant an\ninjunction to stay proceedings in a State court except as expressly\nauthorized by Act of Congress, or where necessary in aid of its\njurisdiction, or to protect or effectuate its judgments.\u201d 28 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a72283.The statute, we have recognized, \u201cis a necessary\nconcomitant of the Framers\u2019 decision to authorize, and Congress\u2019\ndecision to implement, a dual system of federal and state courts.\u201dChick Kam Choov.Exxon Corp.,486 U. S. 140, 146 (1988). And the\nAct\u2019s core message is one of respect for state courts. The Act\nbroadly commands that those tribunals \u201cshall remain free from\ninterference by federal courts.\u201dAtlantic Coast Line R.\nCo.v.Locomotive Engineers,398 U. S. 281, 282 (1970). That edict\nis subject to only \u201cthree specifically defined exceptions.\u201dId.,at 286. And those exceptions, though designed for\nimportant purposes, \u201care narrow and are \u2018not [to] be enlarged by\nloose statutory construction.\u2019\u00a0\u201dChick Kam Choo,486\nU. S., at 146 (quotingAtlantic Coast Line, 398 U. S., at\n287; alteration in original). Indeed, \u201c[a]ny doubts as to the\npropriety of a federal injunction against state court proceedings\nshould be resolved in favor of permitting the state courts to\nproceed.\u201dId.,at 297.This case involves the last of the Act\u2019s three\nexceptions, known as the relitigation exception. That exception is\nde-signed to implement \u201cwell-recognized concepts\u201d of claim and\nissue preclusion.Chick Kam Choo,486 U. S., at 147. The\nprovision authorizes an injunction to prevent state litigation of a\nclaim or issue \u201cthat previously was presented to and decided by the\nfederal court.\u201dIbid.But in applying this exception, we\nhave taken special care to keep it \u201cstrict and narrow.\u201dId., at 148. After all, a court does not usually \u201cget to\ndictate to other courts the preclusion consequences of its own\njudgment.\u201d 18 C. Wright, A. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal\nPractice and Procedure \u00a74405, p. 82 (2d ed. 2002) (hereinafter\nWright & Miller). Deciding whether and how prior litigation has\npreclusive effect is usually the bailiwick of thesecondcourt (here, the one in West Virginia). So issuing an injunction\nunder the relitigation exception is resorting to heavy\nartillery.[Footnote 5] For that\nreason, every benefit of the doubt goes toward the state court, seeAtlantic Coast Line, 398 U. S., at 287, 297; an injunction\ncan issue only if preclusion is clear beyond peradventure.The question here is whether the federal\ncourt\u2019s rejection of McCollins\u2019 proposed class precluded a later\nadjudication in state court of Smith\u2019s certification motion. For\nthe federal court\u2019s determination of the class issue to have this\npreclusive effect, at least two conditions must be met.[Footnote 6] First, the issue the\nfederal court decided must be the same as the one presented in the\nstate tribunal. See 18 Wright & Miller \u00a74417, at 412. And\nsecond, Smith must have been a party to the federal suit, or else\nmust fall within one of a few discrete exceptions to the general\nrule against binding nonparties. See 18Aid.,\u00a74449, at\n330. In fact, as we will explain, the issues before the two courts\nwere not the same, and Smith was neither a party nor the\nex-ceptional kind of nonparty who can be bound. So the courts below\nerred in finding the certification issue precluded, and erred all\nthe more in thinking an injunction appropriate.[Footnote 7]AIn our most recent case on the\nrelitigation exception,Chick Kam Choov.Exxon,\nwe applied the \u201csame issue\u201d requirement of preclusion law to\ninvalidate a federal court\u2019s injunction. 486 U. S., at 151. The\nfederal court had dismissed a suit involving Singapore law on\ngrounds offorum non conveniens. After the plaintiff\nbrought the same claim in Texas state court, the federal court\nissued an injunction barring the plaintiff from pursuing relief in\nthat alternate forum. We held that the District Court had gone too\nfar. \u201c[A]n essential prerequisite for applying the relitigation\nexception,\u201d we explained, \u201cis that the \u2026 issues which the federal\ninjunction insulates from litigation in state proceedings actually\nhave been decided by the federal court.\u201dId., at 148. That\nprerequisite, we thought, was not satisfied because the issue to be\nadjudicated in state court was not the one the federal court had\nresolved. The federal court had considered the permissibility of\nthe claim under federalforum non conveniensprinciples.\nBut the Texas courts, we thought, \u201cwould apply a significantly\ndifferentforum non conveniensanalysis,\u201did., at\n149; they had in prior cases rejected the strictness of the federal\ndoctrine. Our conclusion followed: \u201c[W]hether the Texasstatecourts are an appropriate forum for [the\nplaintiff\u2019s] Singapore law claims has not yet been litigated.\u201dIbid.Because the legal standards in the two courts\ndiffered, the issues before the courts differed, and an injunction\nwas unwarranted.The question here closely\nresembles the one inChick Kam Choo.The class Smith\nproposed in state court mirrored the class McCollins sought to\ncertify in federal court: Both included all Baycol purchasers\nresident in West Virginia. Moreover, the substantive claims in the\ntwo suits broadly overlapped: Both complaints alleged that Bayer\nhad sold a defective product in violation of the State\u2019s consumer\nprotection law and the company\u2019s warranties. So far, so good for\npreclusion. But not so fast: a critical question\u2014the question of\nthe applicable legal standard\u2014remains. The District Court ruled\nthat the proposed class did not meet the requirements of Federal\nRule 23 (because individualized issues would predominate over\ncommon ones). But the state court was poised to consider whether\nthe proposed class satisfiedWest VirginiaRule 23. If\nthose two legal standards differ (as federal and stateforum\nnon convenienslaw differed inChick Kam Choo)\u2014then\nthe federal court resolved an issue not before the state court. In\nthat event, much like inChick Kam Choo, \u201cwhether the\n[West Virginia]statecour[t]\u201d should certify the proposed\nclass action \u201chas not yet been litigated.\u201d 486 U. S., at 149.The Court of Appeals and Smith offer us two\ncompeting ways of deciding whether the West Virginia and Federal\nRules differ, but we think the right path lies somewhere in the\nmiddle. The Eighth Circuit relied almost exclusively on the\nnear-identity of the two Rules\u2019 texts. See 593 F.\u00a03d, at 723.\nThat was the right place to start, but not to end. Federal and\nstate courts, after all, can and do apply identically worded\nprocedural provisions in widely varying ways. If a State\u2019s\nprocedural provision tracks the language of a Federal Rule, but a\nstate court interprets that provision in a manner federal courts\nhave not, then the state court is using a different standard and\nthus deciding a different issue. See 18 Wright & Miller \u00a74417,\nat 454 (stating that preclusion is \u201cinappropriate\u201d when \u201cdifferent\nlegal standards \u2026 masquerad[e] behind similar legal labels\u201d). At\nthe other extreme, Smith contends that the source of law is all\nthat matters: a different sovereign must in each and every case\n\u201chave the opportunity, if it chooses, to construe its procedural\nrule differently.\u201d Brief for Petitioners 22 (quoting ALI,\nPrinciples of the Law, Aggregate Litigation \u00a72.11, Reporters\u2019\nNotes,cmt. b, p.\u00a0181 (2010)). But if state courts\nhave made crystal clear that they follow the same approach as the\nfederal court applied, we see no need to ignore that determination;\nin that event, the issues in the two cases would indeed be the\nsame. So a federal court considering whether the relitigation\nexception applies should examine whether state law parallels its\nfederal counterpart. But as suggested earlier, seesupra,\nat 6, the federal court must resolve any uncertainty on that score\nby leaving the question of preclusion to the state courts.Under this approach, the West Virginia Supreme\nCourt has gone some way toward resolving the matter before us by\ndeclaring its independence from federal courts\u2019 interpretation of\nthe Federal Rules\u2014and particularly of Rule 23. InIn\u00a0re\nW.\u00a0Va. Rezulin Litigation,214 W.\u00a0Va. 52, 585 S. E.\n2d 52 (2003)(In\u00a0re Rezulin), the West Virginia high\ncourt considered a plaintiff\u2019s motion to certify a\nclass\u2014coincidentally enough, in a suit about an allegedly defective\npharmaceutical product. The court made a point of complaining about\nthe parties\u2019 and lower court\u2019s near-exclusive reliance on federal\ncases about Federal Rule 23 to decide the certification question.\nSuch cases, the court cautioned, \u201c\u00a0\u2018may be persuasive, but\n[they are] not binding or controlling.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId., at 61,\n585 S.\u00a0E. 2d, at 61. And lest anyone mistake the import of\nthis message, the court went on: The aim of \u201cthis rule is to avoid\nhaving our legal analysis of our Rules \u2018amount to nothing more than\nPavlovian responses to federal decisional law.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIbid.(italics omitted).Of course, the state\ncourts might still have adopted an approach to their Rule 23 that\ntracked the analysis the federal court used in McCollins\u2019 case. But\nabsent clear evidence that the state courts had done so, we could\nnot conclude that they would interpret their Rule in the same way.\nAnd if that is so, we could not tell whether the certification\nissues in the state and federal courts were the same. That\nuncertainty would preclude an injunction.But here the case against an injunction is\neven stronger, because the West Virginia Supreme Court hasdisapprovedthe approach to Rule 23(b)(3)\u2019s predominance\nrequirement that the Federal District Court embraced. Recall that\nthe federal court held that the presence of a single individualized\nissue\u2014injury from the use of Baycol\u2014prevented class certification.\nSeesupra, at 3. The court did not identify the common\nissues in the case; nor did it balance these common issues against\nthe need to prove individual injury to determine which\npredominated. The court instead applied a strict test barring class\ntreatment when proof of each plaintiff\u2019s injury is\nnecessary.[Footnote 8] By\ncontrast, the West Virginia Supreme Court inIn\u00a0 re\nRezulinadopted an all-things-considered, balancing inquiry in\ninterpreting its Rule 23. Rejecting any \u201crigid test,\u201d the state\ncourt opined that the predominance requirement \u201ccontemplates a\nreview of many factors.\u201d 214 W.\u00a0Va., at 72, 585 S. E. 2d, at\n72. Indeed, the court noted, a \u201c\u00a0\u2018single common issue\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nin a case could outweigh \u201c\u00a0\u2018numerous \u2026 individual\nquestions.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIbid.That meant, the court further\nexplained (quoting what it termed the \u201cleading treatise\u201d on the\nsubject), that even objections to certification \u201c\u00a0\u2018based on \u2026\ncausation, or reliance\u2019\u00a0\u201d\u2014which typically involve showings of\nindividual injury\u2014\u201c\u00a0\u2018will not bar predominance\nsatisfaction.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIbid.(quoting 2 A. Conte & H.\nNewberg, Newberg on Class Actions \u00a74.26, p. 241 (4th ed.\n2002)).So point for point, the analysis set out inIn\u00a0re Rezulindiverged from the District Court\u2019s\ninterpretation of Federal Rule 23. A state court using theIn\u00a0re Rezulinstandard would decide a different\nquestion than the one the federal court had earlier\nresolved.[Footnote 9]This case, indeed, is little more than a rerun\nofChick Kam Choo. A federal court and a state court apply\ndifferent law. That means they decide distinct questions. The\nfederal court\u2019s resolution of one issue does not preclude the state\ncourt\u2019s determination of another. It then goes without saying that\nthe federal court may not issue an injunction. TheAnti-Injunction Act\u2019sre-litigation exception\ndoes not extend nearly so far.BThe injunction issued here runs\ninto another basic premise of preclusion law: A court\u2019s judgment\nbinds only the parties to a suit, subject to a handful of discrete\nand limited exceptions. See,e.g., 18A Wright & Miller\n\u00a74449, at 330. The importance of this rule and the narrowness of\nits exceptions go hand in hand. We have repeatedly \u201cemphasize[d]\nthe fundamental nature of the general rule\u201d that only parties can\nbe bound by prior judgments; accordingly, we have taken a\n\u201cconstrained approach to nonparty preclusion.\u201dTaylorv.Sturgell,553 U. S. 880, 898\n(2008). Against this backdrop, Bayer defends the decision below by\narguing that Smith\u2014an unnamed member of a proposed but uncertified\nclass\u2014qualifies as a party to the McCollins litigation. See Brief\nfor Respondent 32\u201334. Alternatively, Bayer claims that the District\nCourt\u2019s judgment binds Smith under the recognized exception to the\nrule against nonparty preclusion for members of class actions. Seeid., at 34\u201339. We think neither contention has merit.Bayer\u2019s first claim ill-comports\nwith any proper understanding of what a \u201cparty\u201d is. In general,\n\u201c[a] \u2018party\u2019 to litigation is \u2018[o]ne by or against whom a lawsuit\nis brought,\u2019\u00a0\u201dUnited States ex rel. Eisensteinv.City of New York, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at\n4), or one who \u201cbecome[s] a party by intervention, substitution, or\nthird-party practice,\u201dKarcherv.May,484 U. S. 72, 77 (1987).\nAnd we have further held that an unnamed member of acertifiedclass may be \u201cconsidered a \u2018party\u2019 for the\n[particular] purpos[e] of appealing\u201d an adverse judgment.Devlinv.Scardelletti,536 U. S. 1, 7 (2002). But\nas the dissent inDevlinnoted, no one in that case was\n\u201cwilling to advance the novel and surely erroneous argument that a\nnonnamed class member is a party to the class-action litigationbefore the class is certified.\u201dId., at 16, n. 1\n(opinion of Scalia, J.). Still less does that argument make senseonce certification is denied. The definition of the term\n\u201cparty\u201d can on no account be stretched so far as to cover a person\nlike Smith, whom the plaintiff in a lawsuit was denied leave to\nrepresent.[Footnote 10] If\nthe judgment in the McCollins litigation can indeed bind Smith, it\nmust do so under principles ofnonparty preclusion.As Bayer notes, see Brief for Respondent 37,\none such principle allows unnamed members of a class action to be\nbound, even though they are not parties to the suit. SeeCooperv.Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond,467 U. S. 867,\n874 (1984) (\u201c[U]nder elementary principles of prior adjudication a\njudgment in a properly entertained class action is binding on class\nmembers in any subsequent litigation\u201d); see alsoTaylor,\n553 U. S., at 894 (stating that nonparties can be bound in\n\u201cproperly conducted class actions\u201d). But here Bayer faces a\nconundrum. If we know one thing about the McCollins suit, we know\nthat it wasnota class action. Indeed, the very ruling\nthat Bayer argues ought to be given preclusive effect is the\nDistrict Court\u2019s decision that a class could not properly be\ncertified. So Bayer wants to bind Smith as a member of a class\naction (because it is only as such that a nonparty in Smith\u2019s\nsituation can be bound) to a determination that there could not be\na class action. And if the logic of that position is not\nimmediately transparent, here is Bayer\u2019s attempt to clarify:\n\u201c[U]ntil the moment when class certi-fication was denied, theMcCollinscasewasa properly conducted class\naction.\u201d Brief for Respondent 37. That is true, according to Bayer,\nbecause McCollins\u2019 interests were aligned with the members of the\nclass he proposed and he \u201cact[ed] in a representative capacity when\nhe sought class certification.\u201dId.,at 36.But wishing does not make it so. McCollins\nsought class certification, but he failed to obtain that result.\nBecause the District Court found that individual issues\npredominated, it held that the action did not satisfy Federal Rule\n23\u2019s requirements for class proceedings. In these circumstances, we\ncannot say that a properly conducted class action existed at any\ntime in the litigation. Federal Rule 23 determines what is and is\nnot a class action in federal court, where McCollins brought his\nsuit. So in the absence of a certification under that Rule, the\nprecondition for binding Smith was not met. Neither a proposed\nclass action nor a rejected class action may bind nonparties. What\ndoes have this effect is a class action approved under Rule 23. But\nMcCollins\u2019 lawsuit was never that.We made essentially these same points inTaylorv.Sturgelljust a few Terms ago. The\nquestion there concerned the propriety of binding nonparties under\na theory of \u201cvirtual representation\u201d based on \u201cidentity of\ninterests and some kind of relationship between parties and\nnonparties.\u201d 553 U. S., at 901. We rejected the theory unanimously,\nexplaining that it \u201cwould \u2018recogniz[e], in effect, a common-law\nkind of class action.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIbid.Such a device, we\nobjected, would authorize preclusion \u201cshorn of [Rule 23\u2019s]\nprocedural protections.\u201dIbid.Or as otherwise stated in\nthe opinion: We could not allow \u201ccircumvent[ion]\u201d of Rule 23\u2019s\nprotections through a \u201cvirtual representation doctrine that allowed\ncourts to \u2018createde factoclass actions at will.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIbid.We could hardly have been more clear that a\n\u201cproperly conducted class action,\u201d with binding effect on\nnonparties, can come about in federal courts in just one\nway\u2014through the procedure set out in Rule 23. Bayer attempts to\ndistinguishTaylorby noting that the party in the prior\nlitigation there did not propose a class action. But we do not see\nwhy that difference matters. Yes, McCollins wished to represent a\nclass, and made a motion to that effect. But it did not come to\npass. To allow McCollins\u2019 suit to bind nonparties would be to adopt\nthe very theoryTaylorrejected.[Footnote 11]Bayer\u2019s strongest argument comes not from\nestablished principles of preclusion, but instead from policy\nconcerns relating to use of the class action device. Bayer warns\nthat under our approach class counsel can repeatedly try to certify\nthe same class \u201cby the simple expedient of changing the named\nplaintiff in the caption of the complaint.\u201d Brief for Respondent\n47\u201348. And in this world of \u201cserial relitigation of class\ncertification,\u201d Bayer contends, defendants \u201cwould be forced in\neffect to buy litigation peace by settling.\u201dId., at 2,\n12; see alsoIn\u00a0re Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc., Tires\nProds. Liability Litigation,333 F.\u00a03d 763, 767 (CA7\n2003) (objecting to an \u201can asymmetric system in which class counsel\ncan win but never lose\u201d because of their ability to relitigate the\nissue of certification).But this form of argument flies in the face of\nthe rule against nonparty preclusion. That rule perforce leads to\nrelitigation of many issues, as plaintiff after plaintiff after\nplaintiff (none precluded by the last judgment because none a party\nto the last suit) tries his hand at establishing some legal\nprinciple or obtaining some grant of relief. We confronted a\nsimilar policy concern inTaylor, which involved\nlitigation brought under the Freedom of Infor-mation Act (FOIA).\nThe Government there cautioned that unless we bound nonparties a\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018potentially limitless\u2019\u00a0\u201d number of plaintiffs, perhaps\ncoordinating with each other, could \u201cmount a series of repetitive\nlawsuits\u201d demanding the selfsame documents. 553 U. S., at 903. But\nwe rejected this argument, even though the payoff in a single\nsuccessful FOIA suit\u2014disclosure of documents to the public\u2014could\n\u201ctrum[p]\u201d or \u201csubsum[e]\u201d all prior losses, just as a single\nsuccessful class certification motion could do.In\u00a0re\nBridgestone/Firestone, 333 F.\u00a03d, at 766, 767. As that\nresponse suggests, our legal system generally relies on principles\nofstare decisisand comity among courts to mitigate the\nsometimes substantial costs of similar litigation brought by\ndifferent plaintiffs. We have not thought that the right approach\n(except in the discrete categories of cases we have recognized)\nlies in binding nonparties to a judgment.And to the extent class actions raise special\nproblems of relitigation, Congress has provided a remedy that does\nnot involve departing from the usual rules of preclusion. In the\nClass Action Fairness Act of 2005 (CAFA), 28 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7\u00a71332(d), 1453 (2006 ed. and Supp. III), Congress enabled\ndefendants to remove to federal court any sizable class action\ninvolving minimal diversity of citizenship. Once removal takes\nplace, Federal Rule 23 governs certification. And federal courts\nmay consolidate multiple overlapping suits against a single\ndefendant in one court (as the Judicial Panel on Multi-District\nLitigation did for the many actions involving Baycol). See \u00a71407.\nFinally, we would expect federal courts to apply principles of\ncomity to each other\u2019s class certification decisions when\naddressing a common dispute. See,e.g.,Cortez Byrd\nChips, Inc.v.Bill Harbert Constr. Co.,529 U. S. 193, 198\n(2000) (citingLandisv.North American Co.,299 U. S. 248,\n254 (1936)). CAFA may be cold comfort to Bayer with respect to\nsuits like this one beginning before its enactment. But Congress\u2019s\ndecision to address the relitigation concerns associated with class\nactions through the mechanism of removal provides yet another\nreason for federal courts to adhere in this context to longstanding\nprinciples of preclusion.[Footnote 12] And once again, that is especially so when\nthe federal court is deciding whether to go so far as to enjoin a\nstate proceeding.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*The Anti-Injunction Act prohibits\nthe order the District Court entered here. The Act\u2019s relitigation\nexception authorizes injunctions only when a former federal\nadjudication clearly precludes a state-court decision. As we said\nmore than 40 years ago, and have consistently maintained since that\ntime, \u201c[a]ny doubts \u2026 should be resolved in favor of permitting the\nstate courts to proceed.\u201dAtlantic Coast Line, 398 U. S.,\nat 297. Under this approach, close cases have easy answers: The\nfederal court should not issue an injunction, and the state court\nshould decide the preclusion question. But this case does not even\nstrike us as close. The issues in the federal and state lawsuits\ndiffered because the relevant legal standards differed. And the\nmere proposal of a class in the federal action could not bind\npersons who were not parties there. For these reasons, the judgment\nof the Court of Appeals isReversed.*\u00a0Justice Thomas joins Parts I and II\u2013A of\nthis opinion.Footnote 1The Class Action Fairness Act of 2005, 119\nStat. 4, which postdates and therefore does not govern this\nlawsuit, now enables a defendant to remove to federal court certain\nclass actions involving nondiverse parties. See 28 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7\u00a71332(d), 1453(b); see alsoinfra,at 17.Footnote 2Although McCollins had originally sought\ncertification under West Virginia Rule of Civil Procedure 23\n(2011), federal procedural rules govern a case that has been\nremoved to federal court. SeeShady Grove Orthopedic\nAssociates, P.\u00a0A.v.Allstate Ins. Co., 559 U.\nS. ___ (2010).Footnote 3CompareIn\u00a0re Baycol Prods.\nLitigation,593 F.\u00a03d 716, 723 (CA8 2010) (case below)\n(holding that two cases involve the same issue when \u201c[t]he state\nand federal [class] certification rules \u2026 are not significantly\ndifferent\u201d), withJ. R. Clearwater Inc.v.Ashland\nChemical Co.,93 F.\u00a03d 176, 180 (CA5 1996) (holding that\ntwo cases implicate different issues even when \u201c[the state rule] is\nmodeled on \u2026 the Federal Rules\u201d because a \u201c[state] court might well\nexercise [its] discretion in a different manner\u201d).Footnote 4Compare 593 F.\u00a03d, at 724 (\u201c[T]he denial\nof class certification is binding on unnamed [putative] class\nmembers\u201d because they are \u201cin privity to [the parties] in the prior\naction\u201d) andIn\u00a0re Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc., Tires\nProds.

Pick-Up Truck Fuel Tank Prods. Liability\nLitigation,134 F.\u00a03d 133, 141 (CA3 1998) (holding that\nputative \u201cclass members are not parties\u201d and so cannot be bound by\na court\u2019s ruling when \u201cthere is no class pending\u201d).Footnote 5That is especially so because an injunction\nis not the only way to correct a state trial court\u2019s erroneous\nrefusal to give preclusive effect to a federal judgment. As we have\nnoted before, \u201cthe state appellate courts and ultimately this\nCourt\u201d can review and reverse such a ruling. SeeAtlantic Coast\nLine R. Co.v.Locomotive Engineers,398 U. S. 281, 287 (1970).Footnote 6We have held that federal common law governs\nthe preclusive effect of a decision of a federal court sitting in\ndiversity. SeeSemtek Int\u2019l Inc.v.Lockheed Martin\nCorp.,531 U.\nS. 497, 508 (2001). Smith assumes that federal common law\nshould here incorporate West Virginia\u2019s preclusion law, see Brief\nfor Petitioners 15\u201316, whereas Bayer favors looking only to federal\nrules of preclusion because of the federal interests at stake in\nthis case, see Brief for Respondent 18. We do not think the\nquestion matters here. Neither party identifies any way in which\nfederal and state principles of preclusion law differ in any\nrelevant respect. Nor have we found any such divergence. Compare,e.g.,Montanav.United States,440 U. S. 147, 153\u2013154\n(1979) (describing elements of issue preclusion), withStatev.Miller,194 W.\u00a0Va. 3, 9, 459\nS.\u00a0E. 2d 114, 120 (1995) (same). We therefore need not decide\nwhether, in general, federal common law ought to incorporate state\nlaw in situations such as this.Footnote 7Because we rest our decision on the\nAnti-Injunction Act and the principles of issue preclusion that\ninform it, we do not consider Smith\u2019s argument, based onPhillips Petroleum Co.v.Shutts,472 U. S. 797(1985),\nthat the District Court\u2019s action violated the Due Process\nClause.Footnote 8The District Court\u2019s approach to the\npredominance inquiry is consistent with the approach employed by\nthe Eighth Circuit. SeeIn\u00a0re St. Jude Medical, Inc.,\n522 F. 3d 836, 837\u2013840 (2008) (holding that most commercial\nmisrepresentation cases are \u201cunsuitable for class treatment\u201d\nbecause individual issues of reliance necessarily predominate). We\nexpress no opinion as to the correctness of this approach.Footnote 9Bayer argues thatIn\u00a0re Rezulindoes not preclude an injunction in this case because the West\nVirginia court there decided that common issues predominated over\nindividual issues of damages, not over individual issues of\nliability (as exist here). See Brief for Respondent 25\u201326. We think\nBayer is right about this distinction, but wrong about its\nconsequence. Our point is not thatIn\u00a0re Rezulindictates the answer to the class certification question here; the\ntwo cases are indeed too dissimilar for that to be true. The point\ninstead is thatIn\u00a0re Rezulinarticulated a general\napproach to the predominance requirement that differs markedly from\nthe one the federal court used. Minor variations in the application\nof what is in essence the same legal standard do not defeat\npreclusion; but where, as here, the State\u2019s courts \u201cwould apply a\nsignificantly different \u2026 analysis,\u201dChick Kam Choov.Exxon Corp.,486 U. S. 140, 149 (1988), the federal\nand state courts decide different issues.Footnote 10In support of its claim that Smith counts as\na party, Bayer cites two cases in which we held that a putative\nmember of an uncertified class may wait until after the court rules\non the certification motion to file an individual claim or move to\nintervene in the suit. See Brief for Respondent 32\u201333 (citingUnited Airlines, Inc.v.McDonald,432 U. S. 385(1977);American Pipe & Constr. Co.v.Utah,414 U. S. 538(1974)).\nBut these cases, which were specifically grounded in policies of\njudicial administration, demonstrate only that a person not a party\nto a class suit may receive certain benefits (such as the tolling\nof a limitations period) related to that proceeding. Seeid.,at 553;McDonald, 432 U. S., at 394,\nn.\u00a015. That result is consistent with a commonplace of\npreclusion law\u2014that nonparties sometimes may benefit from, even\nthough they cannot be bound by, former litigation. SeeParklane\nHosiery Co.v.Shore,439 U. S. 322, 326\u2013333\n(1979);Blonder-Tongue Laboratories, Inc.v.University of Ill. Foundation,402 U. S. 313(1971).Footnote 11The great weight of scholarly authority\u2014from\nthe Restatement of Judgments to the American Law Institute to\nWright and Miller\u2014agrees that an uncertified class action cannot\nbind proposed class members. See Restatement (Second) of Judgments\n\u00a741(1), p. 393 (1980) (A nonparty may be bound only when his\ninterests are adequately represented by \u201c[t]he representative of a\nclass of persons similarly situated, designated as such with the\napproval of the court\u201d); ALI, Principles of the Law\nAggregate Litigation \u00a72.11, Reporters\u2019 Notes,cmt. b, p.\n181 (2010) (\u201c[N]one of [the exceptions to the rule against nonparty\npreclusion] extend generally to the situation of a would-be absent\nclass member with respect to a denial of class certification\u201d); 18A\nWright & Miller \u00a74455, at 457\u2013458 (\u201c[A]bsent certification\nthere is no basis for precluding a nonparty\u201d under the class-action\nexception).Footnote 12By the same token, nothing in our holding\ntoday forecloses legislation to modify established principles of\npreclusion should Congress decide that CAFA does not sufficiently\nprevent relitigation of class certification motions. Nor does this\nopinion at all address the permissibility of a change in the\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure pertaining to this question.
