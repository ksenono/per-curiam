S. ____ (2011)SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESNO. 09-893AT&T MOBILITY LLC, PETITIONERv.VINCENT CONCEPCION et ux.on writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the ninth circuit[April 27, 2011]Justice Thomas, concurring.Section 2 of the Federal\nArbitration Act (FAA) provides that an arbitration provision \u201cshall\nbe valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as\nexist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.\u201d 9 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a72. The question here is whether California\u2019sDiscover Bankrule, seeDiscover Bankv.Superior Ct., 36 Cal. 4th 148, 113 P.\u00a03d 1100 (2005),\nis a \u201cgroun[d] \u2026 for the revocation of any contract.\u201dIt would be absurd to suggest that \u00a72 requires\nonly that a defense apply to \u201cany contract.\u201d If \u00a72 means anything,\nit is that courts cannot refuse to enforce arbitration agreements\nbecause of a state public policy against arbitration, even if the\npolicy nominally applies to \u201cany contract.\u201d There must be some\nadditional limit on the contract defenses permitted by \u00a72. Cf.ante, at 17 (opinion of the Court) (state law may not\nrequire procedures that are \u201cnot arbitration as envisioned by the\nFAA\u201d and \u201clac[k] its benefits\u201d);post, at 5 (Breyer, J.,\ndissenting) (state law may require only procedures that are\n\u201cconsistent with the use of arbitration\u201d).I write separately to explain how I would find\nthat limit in the FAA\u2019s text. As I would read it, the FAA requires\nthat an agreement to arbitrate be enforced unless a party\nsuccessfully challenges the formation of the arbitration agreement,\nsuch as by proving fraud or duress. 9 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a72, 4. Under\nthis reading, I would reverse the Court of Appeals because a\ndistrict court cannot follow both the FAA and theDiscover\nBankrule, which does not relate to defects in the making of\nan agreement.This reading of the text, however, has not\nbeen fully developed by any party, cf. Brief for Petitioner 41,\nn.\u00a012, and could benefit from briefing and argument in an\nappropriate case. Moreover, I think that the Court\u2019s test will\noften lead to the same outcome as my textual interpretation and\nthat, when possible, it is important in interpreting statutes to\ngive lower courts guidance from a majority of the Court. SeeUS\nAirways, Inc.v.Barnett,535 U. S. 391, 411\n(2002) (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring). Therefore, although I adhere to\nmy views on purposes-and-objectives pre-emption, seeWyethv.Levine,555 U. S. 555, ___\n(2009) (opinion concurring in judgment), I reluctantly join the\nCourt\u2019s opinion.IThe FAA generally requires courts\nto enforce arbitration agreements as written. Section 2 provides\nthat \u201c[a] written provision in \u2026 a contract \u2026 to settle by\narbitration a controversy thereafter arising out of such contract \u2026\nshall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such\ngrounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any\ncontract.\u201d Significantly, the statute does not parallel the words\n\u201cvalid, irrevocable, and enforceable\u201d by referencing the grounds as\nexist for the \u201cinvalidation, revocation, or nonenforcement\u201d of any\ncontract. Nor does the statute use a different word or phrase\nentirely that might arguably encompass validity, revocability, and\nenforce-ability. The use of only \u201crevocation\u201d and the conspicuous\nomission of \u201cinvalidation\u201d and \u201cnonenforcement\u201d suggest that the\nexception does not include all defenses applicable to any contract\nbut rather some subset of those defenses. SeeDuncanv.Walker,533\nU. S. 167, 174 (2001) (\u201cIt is our duty to give effect, if\npossible, to every clause and word of a statute\u201d (internal\nquotation marks omitted)).Concededly, the difference\nbetween revocability, on the one hand, and validity and\nenforceability, on the other, is not obvious. The statute does not\ndefine the terms, and their ordinary meanings arguably overlap.\nIndeed, this Court and others have referred to the concepts of\nrevocability, validity, and enforceability interchangeably. But\nthis ambiguity alone cannot justify ignoring Congress\u2019 clear\ndecision in \u00a72 to repeat only one of the three concepts.To clarify the meaning of \u00a72, it would be\nnatural to look to other portions of the FAA. Statutory\ninterpretation focuses on \u201cthe language itself, the specific\ncontext in which that language is used, and the broader context of\nthe statute as a whole.\u201dRobinsonv.Shell Oil\nCo.,519 U. S.\n337, 341 (1997). \u201cA provision that may seem ambiguous in\nisolation is often clarified by the remainder of the statutory\nscheme \u2026 because only one of the permissible meanings produces a\nsubstantive effect that is compatible with the rest of the law.\u201dUnited Sav. Assn. of Tex.v.Timbers of Inwood Forest\nAssociates, Ltd.,484 U. S. 365, 371\n(1988).Examining the broader statutory scheme, \u00a74 can\nbe read to clarify the scope of \u00a72\u2019s exception to the enforcement\nof arbitration agreements. When a party seeks to enforce an\narbitration agreement in federal court, \u00a74 requires that \u201cupon\nbeing satisfied that the making of the agreement for arbitration or\nthe failure to comply therewith is not in issue,\u201d the court must\norder arbitration \u201cin accordance with the terms of the\nagreement.\u201dReading \u00a7\u00a72 and 4 harmoniously,\nthe \u201cgrounds \u2026 for the revocation\u201d preserved in \u00a72 would mean\ngrounds related to the making of the agreement. This would require\nenforcement of an agreement to arbitrate unless a party\nsuccessfully asserts a defense concerning the formation of the\nagreement to arbitrate, such as fraud, duress, or mutual mistake.\nSeePrima Paint Corp.v.Flood & Conklin Mfg.\nCo.,388 U. S.\n395, 403\u2013404 (1967) (interpreting \u00a74 to permit federal courts\nto adjudicate claims of \u201cfraud in the inducement of the arbitration\nclause itself\u201d because such claims \u201cg[o] to the \u2018making\u2019 of the\nagreement to arbitrate\u201d). Contract defenses unrelated to the making\nof the agreement\u2014such as public policy\u2014could not be the basis for\ndeclining to enforce an arbitration clause.IIUnder this reading,\nthe question here would be whether California\u2019sDiscover\nBankrule relates to the making of an agreement. I think it\ndoes not.InDiscover\nBank, 36 Cal. 4th 148, 113 P.\u00a03d 1100, the California\nSupreme Court held that \u201cclass action waivers are, under certain\ncircumstances, unconscionable as unlaw-fully exculpatory.\u201dId., at 65, 113 P.\u00a03d, at 1112; see alsoid., at 161, 113 P.\u00a03d, at 1108 (\u201c[C]lass action\nwaivers [may be] substantively unconscionable inasmuch as they may\noperate effectively as exculpatory contract clauses that are\ncontrary to public policy\u201d). The court concluded that where a\nclass-action waiver is found in an arbitration agreement in certain\nconsumer contracts of adhesion, such waivers \u201cshould not be\nenforced.\u201dId.,at 163, 113 P.\u00a03d, at 1110. In\npractice, the court explained, such agreements \u201coperate to insulate\na party from liability that otherwise would be imposed under\nCalifornia law.\u201dId.,at 161, 113 P.\u00a03d, at 1108,\n1109. The court did not conclude that a customer would sign such an\nagreement only if under the influence of fraud, duress, or\ndelusion.The court\u2019s analysis and\nconclusion that the arbitration agreement was exculpatory reveals\nthat theDiscover Bankrule does not concern the making of\nthe arbitration agreement. Exculpatory contracts are a paradigmatic\nex-ample of contracts that will not be enforced because of public\npolicy. 15 G. Giesel, Corbin on Contracts \u00a7\u00a785.1, 85.17, 85.18\n(rev. ed. 2003). Indeed, the court explained that it would not\nenforce the agreements because they are \u201c\u00a0\u2018against the policy\nof the law.\u2019\u00a0\u201d 36 Cal. 4th, at 161, 113 P.\u00a03d, at 1108\n(quoting Cal. Civ. Code Ann. \u00a71668); see also 36 Cal. 4th, at 166,\n113 P.\u00a03d, at 1112 (\u201cAgreements to arbitrate may not be used\nto harbor terms, conditions and practices that undermine public\npolicy\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). Refusal to enforce a\ncontract for public-policy reasons does not concern whether the\ncontract was properly made.Accordingly, theDiscover\nBankrule is not a \u201cgroun[d] \u2026 for the revocation of any\ncontract\u201d as I would read \u00a72 of the FAA in light of \u00a74. Under this\nreading, the FAA dictates that the arbitration agreement here be\nenforced and theDiscover Bankrule is\npre-empted.The interpretation I suggest\nwould be consistent with our precedent. Contract formation is based\non the consent of the parties, and we have emphasized that\n\u201c[a]rbitration under the Act is a matter of consent.\u201dVolt\nInformation Sciences, Inc.v.Board of Trustees of Leland\nStanford Junior Univ.,489 U. S. 468, 479\n(1989).The statement inPerryv.Thomas,482\nU. S. 483(1987), suggesting that \u00a72 preserves all state-law\ndefenses that \u201carose to govern issues concerning the validity,\nrevocability, and enforceability of contracts generally,\u201did., at 493, n.\u00a09, is dicta. This statement is found\nin a footnote concerning a claim that the Court \u201cdecline[d] to\naddress.\u201dId., at 392, n.\u00a09.Similarly, to\nthe extent that statements inRent-A-Center, West, Inc.v.Jackson, 561 U. S. ___, ___ n. 1 (2010) (slip op. at ___,\nn.\u00a01), can be read to suggest anything about the scope of\nstate-law defenses under \u00a72, those statements are dicta, as well.\nThis Court has never addressed the question whether the state-law\n\u201cgrounds\u201d referred to in \u00a72 are narrower than those applicable to\nany contract.Moreover, every specific contract\ndefense that the Court has acknowledged is applicable under \u00a72\nrelates to contract formation. InDoctor\u2019s Associates,\nInc.v.Casarotto,517 U. S. 681, 687\n(1996), this Court said that fraud, duress, and unconscionability\n\u201cmay be applied to invalidate arbitration agreements without\ncontravening \u00a72.\u201d All three defenses historically concern the\nmaking of an agreement. SeeMorgan Stanley Capital Group\nInc.v.Public Util. Dist. No. 1 of Snohomish Cty.,554 U. S. 527,\n547 (2008) (describing fraud and duress as \u201ctraditional grounds for\nthe abrogation of [a] contract\u201d that speak to \u201cunfair dealing at\nthe contract formation stage\u201d);Humev.United\nStates,132 U.\nS. 406, 411, 414 (1889) (describing an unconscionable contract\nas one \u201csuch as no man in his senses and not under delusion would\nmake\u201d and suggesting that there may be \u201ccontracts so extortionate\nand unconscionable on their face as to raise the presumption of\nfraud in their inception\u201d (internal quotation marks\nomitted)).",
