WALL, II, DIRECTOR, RHODE ISLAND\nDEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS, PETI- TIONERv.KHALIL\nKHOLIon writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the first circuit[March 7, 2011]Justice Alito delivered the\nopinion of the Court.Under the Antiterrorism and\nEffective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), \u201ca properly filed\napplication for State post-conviction or other collateral review\nwith respect to the pertinent judgment or claim\u201d tolls the 1-year\nlimitation period for filing a federal habeas petition. 28 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a72244(d)(2). The question in this case is whether a\nmotion to reduce sentence under Rhode Island law tolls the\nlimitation period, thereby rendering respondent Khalil Kholi\u2019s\nfederal habeas petition timely. We hold that the phrase \u201ccollateral\nreview\u201d in \u00a72244(d)(2) means judicial review of a judgment in a\nproceeding that is not part of direct review. Because the parties\nagree that a motion to reduce sentence under Rhode Island law is\nnot part of the direct review process, we hold that respondent\u2019s\nmotion tolled the AEDPA limitation period and that his federal\nhabeas petition was therefore timely.IAIn 1993, respondent was convicted\nin Rhode Island Superior Court on 10 counts of first-degree sexual\nassault, and he was sentenced to consecutive terms of life\nim-prisonment. Respondent raised various challenges to his\nconviction on direct appeal, but the Supreme Court of Rhode Island\naffirmed his conviction. SeeStatev.Kholi, 672\nA.\u00a02d 429, 431 (1996). The parties agree that respondent\u2019s\nconviction became final on direct review when his time expired for\nfiling a petition for a writ of certiorari in this Court. Brief for\nPetitioner 7, n.\u00a04; Brief for Respondent 3, n.\u00a01; 582\nF.\u00a03d 147, 150 (CA1 2009); see generallyJimenezv.Quarterman,555 U. S. 113, ___ (2009) (slip op.,\nat 6). That date was May 29, 1996. See this Court\u2019s Rules 13.1,\n13.3, 30.1.In addition to taking a direct\nappeal, respondent filed two state motions that are relevant to our\ndecision. The first, filed on May 16, 1996, was a motion to reduce\nsentence under Rule 35 of the Rhode Island Superior Court Rules of\nCriminal Procedure.[Footnote 1]\nApp. 8. In that motion, respondent asked the trial court to\n\u201creconsider its prior determination\u201d and \u201corder that his life\nsentences run concurrently.\u201dStatev.Kholi, 706\nA.\u00a02d 1326 (R.\u00a0I. 1998) (order). Concluding that \u201cthe\nsentence imposed was appropriate,\u201d the hearing justice denied the\nRule 35 motion.Ibid.On January 16, 1998, the State\nSupreme Court affirmed and observed that the facts clearly\njustified the sentence.Id.,at 1326\u20131327.On May 23, 1997, while the Rule 35 motion was\npending, respondent also filed an application for state\npostconviction relief, see R.\u00a0I. Gen. Laws 10\u20139.1\u20131et\nseq.(Lexis 1997) (titled \u201cPost Conviction Remedy\u201d), which\nchallenged his conviction. The trial court denied this motion as\nwell, and the State Supreme Court affirmed that decision on\nDecember 14, 2006. SeeKholiv.Wall, 911\nA.\u00a02d 262, 263\u2013264 (R.\u00a0I. 2006).BRespondent filed a federal habeas\npetition in the District of Rhode Island on September 5, 2007. App.\n3. By that time, his conviction had been final for over 11 years.\nAEDPA generally requires a federal habeas petition to be filed\nwithin one year of the date on which the judgment became final by\nthe conclusion of direct review. 28 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a72244(d)(1)(A).\nBut the 1-year limitation period is tolled during the pendency of\n\u201ca properly filed application for State post-conviction or other\ncollateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim.\u201d\n\u00a72244(d)(2).There is no dispute that\nrespondent\u2019s application for postconviction relief tolled the\nlimitation period for over nine years\u2014from May 23, 1997, through\nDecember 14, 2006. 582 F.\u00a03d, at 151. Even after subtracting\nthat stretch of time from the 11-year period, however, the period\nbetween the conclusion of direct review and the filing of the\nfederal habeas petition still exceeds one year. Thus, in order for\nrespondent\u2019s petition to be timely, the Rule 35 motion to reduce\nsentence must also trigger the tolling provision.Respondent\u2019s federal habeas petition was\nreferred to a Magistrate Judge for a report and recommendation, and\nthe Magistrate Judge concluded that the Rule 35 motion was not a\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018properly filed application for post-conviction or other\ncollateral review\u2019\u00a0\u201d under \u00a72244(d)(2) because it was \u201ca \u2018plea\nof leniency,\u2019 and not a motion challenging the legal sufficiency of\nhis sentence.\u201d No. CA 07\u2013346S, 2008 WL 60194, *4 (R.\u00a0I., Jan.\n3, 2008). The District Court adopted the Magistrate Judge\u2019s report\nand recommendation and therefore dismissed the federal habeas\npetition as untimely. Seeid.,at *1. On appeal, the First\nCircuit reversed. 582 F.\u00a03d 147.The Courts of Appeals are divided over the\nquestion whether a motion to reduce sentence tolls the period of\nlimitation under \u00a72244(d)(2).[Footnote 2] We granted certiorari to answer this question\nwith respect to a motion to reduce sentence under Rhode Island law.\n560 U. S. ___ (2010).IIAAEDPA establishes a 1-year period\nof limitation for a state prisoner to file a federal application\nfor a writ of habeas corpus. \u00a72244(d)(1). This period runs \u201cfrom\nthe latest of\u201d four specified dates, including \u201cthe date on which\nthe judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the\nexpiration of the time for seeking such review.\u201d \u00a72244(d)(1)(A);\nsee alsoJimenez,supra, at ___ (slip op., at 6)\n(explaining when \u201cthe conclusion of direct review occurs\u201d). The\nlimitation period is tolled, however, during the pendency of \u201ca\nproperly filed application for State post-conviction or other\ncollateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim.\u201d\n\u00a72244(d)(2). The question in this case is whether a motion for\nreduction of sentence under Rhode Island\u2019s Rule 35 is an\n\u201capplication for State post-conviction or other collateral\nreview.\u201dThe parties agree that the answer\nto this question turns on the meaning of the phrase \u201ccollateral\nreview,\u201d see Brief for Petitioner 19; Brief for Respondent 12\u201313,\nbut they disagree about the definition of that term. Rhode Island\nargues that \u201ccollateral review\u201d includes only \u201clegal\u201d challenges to\na conviction or sentence and thus excludes motions seeking a\ndiscretionary sentence reduction. Respondent, on the other hand,\nmaintains that \u201ccollateral review\u201d is \u201creview other than review of\na judgment in the direct appeal process\u201d and thus includes motions\nto reduce sentence. Brief for Respondent 17. We agree with\nrespondent\u2019s understanding of \u201ccollateral review.\u201dB\u201cCollateral review\u201d is not\ndefined in AEDPA, and we have never provided a comprehensive\ndefinition of that term. SeeDuncanv.Walker,533 U. S. 167,\n175\u2013178 (2001). We therefore begin by considering the ordinary\nunderstanding of the phrase \u201ccollateral review.\u201d SeeWilliamsv.Taylor,529 U. S. 420, 431\n(2000) (\u201cWe give the words of a statute their ordinary,\ncontemporary, common meaning, absent an indication Congress\nintended them to bear some different import\u201d (internal quotation\nmarks omitted)); see alsoCareyv.Saffold,536 U. S. 214,\n219 (2002) (considering the ordinary meaning of the word \u201cpending\u201d\nin \u00a72244(d)(2)).The term \u201ccollateral,\u201d in its\n\u201ccustomary and preferred sense,\u201dWilliams,supra,at 431, means \u201c[l]ying aside from the main subject, line of action,\nissue, purpose, etc.; \u2026 subordinate, indirect,\u201d 3 Oxford English\nDictionary 473 (2d ed. 1989) (hereinafter OED); see also Webster\u2019s\nThird New International Dictionary 444 (1993) (hereinafter\nWebster\u2019s) (\u201caccompanying as \u2026 secondary,\u201d \u201cindirect,\u201d or\n\u201cancillary\u201d). By definition, something that is \u201ccollateral\u201d is\n\u201cindirect,\u201d not direct. 3 OED 473. This suggests that \u201ccollateral\u201d\nreview is review that is \u201c[l]ying aside from the main\u201d review,i.e.,that is not part of direct review. Seeibid.The definition of the related phrase\n\u201ccollateral attack\u201d points in the same direction. A \u201ccollateral\nattack\u201d is \u201c[a]n attack on a judgment in a proceedingother\nthan a direct appeal.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 298 (9th ed.\n2009) (emphasis added); cf. Wash. Rev. Code \u00a710.73.090(2) (2008)\n(defining \u201ccollateral attack\u201d as \u201cany form of postconviction relief\nother than a direct appeal\u201d). This usage buttresses the conclusion\nthat \u201ccollateral review\u201d means a form of review that is not part of\nthe direct appeal process.COur prior usage of the term\n\u201ccollateral\u201d also supports this understanding. We have previously\ndescribed a variety of proceedings as \u201ccollateral,\u201d and all of\nthese proceedings share the characteristic that we have identified,i.e.,they stand apart from the process of direct\nreview.For example, our cases make it\nclear that habeas corpus is a form of collateral review. We have\nused the terms habeas corpus and \u201ccollateral review\u201d\ninterchangeably, see,e.g.,Murrayv.Carrier,477 U. S. 478, 482\u2013483\n(1986), and it is well accepted that state petitions for habeas\ncorpus toll the limitation period,e.g., Rhinesv.Weber,544\nU. S. 269, 272 (2005) (\u201c[T]he 1-year statute of limitations \u2026\nwas tolled while Rhines\u2019 state habeas corpus petition was\npending\u201d).We have also describedcoram nobisas\na means of \u201ccollateral attack,\u201d see,e.g.,United\nStatesv.Morgan,346 U. S. 502, 510\u2013511\n(1954) (internal quotation marks omitted), and we have used the\nterm \u201ccollateral\u201d to describe proceedings under 28 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a72255 and a prior version of Rule 35 of the Federal Rules of\nCriminal Procedure. InUnited Statesv.Robinson,361 U. S. 220(1960), we distinguished between the process of direct appeal and\n\u201ca number of collateral remedies,\u201d including Federal Rule 35\nmotions, \u00a72255 motions, andcoram nobis.Id.,at\n230, n.\u00a014. Similarly, inBartonev.United\nStates,375 U.\nS. 52(1963)(per curiam), we drew a distinction\nbetween a \u201c[d]irect attack\u201d on a criminal judgment and \u201ccollateral\nproceedings,\u201d such as Rule 35, habeas corpus, and \u00a72255\nproceedings.Id., at 53\u201354.All of the proceedings identified in these\nprior opinions as \u201ccollateral\u201d are separate from the direct review\nprocess, and thus our prior usage of the term \u201ccollateral\u201d\nbuttresses the conclusion that \u201ccollateral review\u201d means a form of\nreview that is not direct.DOf course, to trigger the tolling\nprovision, a \u201ccollateral\u201d proceeding must also involve a form of\n\u201creview,\u201d but the meaning of that term seems clear. \u201cReview\u201d is\nbest understood as an \u201cact of inspecting or examining\u201d or a\n\u201cjudicial reexamination.\u201d Webster\u2019s 1944; see also Black\u2019s,supra,at 1434 (\u201c[c]onsideration, inspection, or\nreexamination of a subject or thing\u201d); 13 OED 831 (\u201c[t]o submit (a\ndecree, act, etc.) to examination or revision\u201d). We thus agree with\nthe First Circuit that \u201c\u00a0\u2018review\u2019 commonly denotes \u2018a looking\nover or examination with a view to amendment or\nimprovement.\u2019\u00a0\u201d 582 F.\u00a03d, at 153 (quoting Webster\u2019s 1944\n(2002)). Viewed as a whole, then, \u201ccollateral review\u201d of a judgment\nor claim means a judicial reexamination of a judgment or claim in a\nproceeding outside of the direct review process.IIIWe now apply this definition of\n\u201ccollateral review\u201d to a Rule 35 motion to reduce sentence under\nRhode Island law.ARule 35 of the Rhode Island Rules\nof Criminal Procedure is much like the version of Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure 35 that was in force prior to the enactment of\nthe federal Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 and the promulgation of\nthe Federal Sentencing Guidelines. SeeStatev.Byrnes, 456 A.\u00a02d 742, 744 (R.\u00a0I. 1983)(per\ncuriam);Reporter\u2019s Notes following R.\u00a0I. Super. Ct. Rule\nCrim. Proc. 35, R.\u00a0I. Court Rules Ann., p. 620 (Lexis 2010).\nUnder the Rhode Island Rules, a Rule 35 motion permits a court to\nprovide relief from a sentence in three ways: A court \u201cmay\u201d\n\u201ccorrect an illegal sentence,\u201d \u201ccorrect a sentence imposed in an\nillegal manner,\u201d and \u201creduce any sentence.\u201d R.\u00a0I. Super. Ct.\nRule Crim. Proc. 35(a); see n.\u00a01,supra. In this\ncase, respondent filed a motion to reduce his sentence, which\npermits a trial justice to decide \u201c\u00a0\u2018\u00a0\u201con reflection or\non the basis of changed circumstances that the sentence originally\nimposed was, for any reason, unduly severe.\u201d\u00a0\u2019\u00a0\u201dStatev.Ruffner, 5 A. 3d 864, 867 (R.\u00a0I.\n2010) (quotingStatev.Mendoza, 958 A.\u00a02d\n1159, 1161 (R.\u00a0I. 2008)); see also Reporter\u2019s Notes following\nR.\u00a0I. Super. Ct. Rule Crim. Proc. 35, R.\u00a0I. Court Rules\nAnn., at 620\u2013621. Rhode Island courts have, at times, referred to\nsuch a motion as a \u201c\u00a0\u2018plea for leniency.\u2019\u00a0\u201dRuffner,supra,at 867 (quotingMendoza,supra, at 1161).A Rule 35 motion is made in the\nSuperior Court, and it is generally heard by the same trial justice\nwho sentenced the defendant.Byrnes,supra,at\n745. The Rhode Island Supreme Court has explained that a motion to\nreduce sentence is \u201c\u00a0\u2018addressed to the sound discretion of the\ntrial justice\u2019\u00a0\u201d and that appellate review of the trial\njustice\u2019s decision is limited.Ruffner,supra,at\n867 (quotingMendoza,supra,at 1161). An\nappellate court may nevertheless disturb the trial justice\u2019s\ndecision \u201cwhen the trial justice has imposed a sentence that is\nwithout justification and is grossly disparate from other sentences\ngenerally imposed for similar offenses.\u201dRuffner,supra,at 867 (quotingStatev.Coleman,\n984 A.\u00a02d 650, 654 (R.\u00a0I. 2009); internal quotation marks\nomitted); see alsoRuffner,supra,at 867 (asking\nwhether trial justice \u201cabuse[d] his discretion\u201d).BWith these principles in mind, we\nconsider whether Rhode Island\u2019s Rule 35 motion to reduce sentence\nis an application for \u201ccollateral review.\u201dThe first\u2014and the\ncritical\u2014question is whether a Rhode Island Rule 35 sentence\nreduction proceeding is \u201ccollateral.\u201d Respondent and Rhode Island\nagree that such a motion is not part of the direct review process.\nMoreover, we have previously referred to a motion to reduce\nsentence under old Rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal\nProcedure as invoking a \u201ccollateral\u201d remedy, seeRobinson,\nsupra,at 230, n.\u00a014, and Rhode Island\u2019s Rule 35 motion\nto reduce sentence is \u201csubstantially similar\u201d to former Federal\nRule 35,Byrnes,supra,at 744. Lower courts have\nalso referred to Federal Rule 35 sentence reduction motions as\n\u201ccollateral.\u201d See,e.g., Fernandezv.United\nStates, 941 F.\u00a02d 1488, 1492 (CA11 1991) (\u201cFernandez\ninitiated a collateral attack on his sentence with a Rule 35(b)\nmotion to reduce his sentence\u201d under the old Federal Rule). We thus\nhave little difficulty concluding that a Rhode Island sentence\nreduction proceeding is \u201ccollateral.\u201d[Footnote 3]Not only is a motion to reduce sentence under\nRhode Island law \u201ccollateral,\u201d but it also undoubtedly calls for\n\u201creview\u201d of the sentence. The decision to reduce a sentence, while\nlargely within the discretion of the trial justice, involves\njudicial reexamination of the sentence to determine whether a more\nlenient sentence is proper.[Footnote 4] When ruling on such a motion, a trial justice\nis guided by several factors, including \u201c(1) the severity of the\ncrime, (2) the defendant\u2019s personal, educational, and employment\nbackground, (3) the potential for rehabilitation, (4) the element\nof societal deterrence, and (5) the appropriateness of the\npunishment.\u201dStatev.Mollicone, 746 A. 2d 135,\n138 (R. I. 2000)(per curiam)(internal quotation marks\nomitted); see alsoRuffner,supra,at 867;Coleman,supra,at 655. On appeal from a trial\njustice\u2019s decision on a motion to reduce sentence, the Supreme\nCourt of Rhode Island evaluates the trial justice\u2019s justifications\nin light of the relevant sentencing factors to determine whether a\nsentence is \u201cwithout justification\u201d and \u201cgrossly disparate from\nother sentences.\u201dRuffner,supra,at 867\n(internal quotation marks omitted).[Footnote 5] This process surely qualifies as \u201creview\u201d of a\nsentence within the meaning of \u00a72244(d)(2).We thus hold that a motion to reduce sentence\nunder Rhode Island law is an application for \u201ccollateral review\u201d\nthat triggers AEDPA\u2019s tolling provision.IVIn resisting this interpretation,\nRhode Island advances several arguments that we find\nunpersuasive.The first of these arguments\nbegins by observing that, whenever our opinions have used the\nprecise phrase \u201ccollateral review,\u201d the proceeding in question was\none challenging the \u201clawfulness\u201d of a prior judgment, Brief for\nPetitioner 21\u201322, such as a \u00a72254 or \u00a72255 action, seeid., at 25. Rhode Island argues that Congress, in enacting\nAEDPA, must be presumed to have been aware of this usage and must\nhave intended the phrase to carry this narrow meaning.This argument reads far too much into these\nprior references to \u201ccollateral review.\u201d While our opinions have\nused the phrase \u201ccollateral review\u201d to refer to proceedings that\nchallenge the lawfulness of a prior judgment, we have never\nsuggested that the phrase may properly be used to describe only\nproceedings of this type. In addition, Rhode Island overlooks\nopinions describing a motion to reduce sentence as \u201ccollateral.\u201dE.g., Robinson, 361 U. S., at 230, n.\u00a014;Fernandez,supra,at 1492; see also 1 D. Wilkes,\nState Postconviction Remedies and Relief Handbook \u00a7\u00a71:2, 1:7, pp.\n2, 15 (2010) (characterizing a motion to reduce sentence as a\n\u201ccollateral\u201d or \u201cpostconviction\u201d remedy).In a related argument, Rhode Island notes that\nseveral other AEDPA provisions use the term \u201ccollateral review\u201d to\nrefer to proceedings that involve a challenge to the lawfulness of\na state-court judgment, see 28 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7\u00a72244(b)(2)(A),\u00a0(d)(1)(C), 2254(e)(2)(A)(i),[Footnote 6] and Rhode Island reasons that\nthe phrase \u201ccollateral review\u201d in \u00a72244(d)(2) should be limited to\nproceedings of this nature. This argument has the same flaw as the\nargument just discussed. Just because the phrase \u201ccollateral\nreview\u201d encompasses proceedings that challenge the lawfulness of a\nprior judgment, it does not follow that other proceedings may not\nalso be described as involving \u201ccollateral review.\u201dFinally, Rhode Island contends that the\npurpose of the tolling provision is to allow a state prisoner to\nexhaust state remedies and that this purpose is not served when a\nprisoner\u2019s state application merely seeks sentencing leniency, a\nmatter that cannot be raised in a federal habeas petition. This\nargument is based on an excessively narrow understanding of\n\u00a72244(d)(2)\u2019s role.It is certainly true thatapurpose\u2014and perhaps the chief purpose\u2014of tolling under \u00a72244(d)(2)\nis to permit the exhaustion of state remedies, seeDuncan,\n533 U. S., at 178\u2013179, but that is not \u00a72244(d)(2)\u2019s only role. The\ntolling provision \u201cprovides a powerful incentive for litigants to\nexhaustallavailable state remedies before proceeding in\nthe lower federal courts.\u201dId.,at 180 (emphasis added).\nTolling the limitation period for all \u201ccollateral review\u201d motions\nprovides both litigants and States with an opportunity to resolve\nobjections at the state level, potentially obviating the need for a\nlitigant to resort to federal court. If, for example, a litigant\nobtains relief on state-law grounds, there may be no need for\nfederal habeas. The same dynamic may be present to a degree with\nrespect to motions that do not challenge the lawfulness of a\njudgment. If a defendant receives relief in state court, the need\nfor federal habeas review may be narrowed or even obviated, and\nthis furthers principles of \u201ccomity, finality, and federalism.\u201dWilliams, 529 U. S., at 436.Rhode Island\u2019s interpretation of \u00a72244(d)(2)\nwould also greatly complicate the work of federal habeas courts.\nRhode Island would require those courts to separate motions for a\nreduced sentence into two categories: those that challenge a\nsentence on legal grounds and those that merely ask for leniency.\nBut this taxonomy is problematic. Even if a jurisdiction allows\nsentencing judges to exercise a high degree of discretion in\nselecting a sentence from within a prescribed range, it does not\nnecessarily follow that the judge\u2019s choice is insulated from\nchallenge on legal grounds. \u201c[D]iscretionary choices are not left\nto a court\u2019s \u2018inclination, but to its judgment; and its judgment is\nto be guided by sound legal principles.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAlbemarle Paper\nCo.v.Moody,422 U. S. 405, 416\n(1975) (quotingUnited Statesv.Burr, 25\nF.\u00a0Cas. 30, 35 (No.\u00a014,692d) (CC Va. 1807) (Marshall,\nC.\u00a0J.)). If the law of a jurisdiction provides criteria to\nguide a trial judge\u2019s exercise of sentencing discretion, a motion\nto reduce sentence may argue that a sentence is inconsistent with\nthose criteria. In that sense, the motion argues that the sentence\nis contrary to sentencing law. See,e.g., Ruffner, 5\nA.\u00a03d,at 867 (\u201cA trial justice considers a number of\nfactors when determining a fair sentence[,] including the\ndefendant\u2019s potential for rehabilitation. The defendant asserts\nthat the trial justice did not consider defendant\u2019s participation\nin rehabilitative programs\u201d (citations omitted)). We do not think\nthat \u00a72244(d)(2) was meant to require federal habeas courts to draw\nthe sort of difficult distinction that Rhode Island\u2019s\ninterpretation would demand.We also reject the argument that the meaning\nof the phrase \u201ccollateral review\u201d should turn on whether the motion\nor application that triggers that review is captioned as a part of\nthe criminal case or as a separate proceeding. SeeWalkowiakv.Haines, 272 F.\u00a03d 234, 237 (CA4\n2001). This interpretation of \u00a72244(d)(2) would produce confusion\nand inconsistency.For one thing, some \u201ccollateral\u201d proceedings\nare often regarded as part of the criminal case. We have said, for\nexample, that a writ ofcoram nobis\u201cis a step in the\ncriminal case and not \u2026 a separate case and record, the beginning\nof a separate civil proceeding.\u201dMorgan, 346 U. S., at\n505, n.\u00a04; see alsoUnited Statesv.Denedo,\n556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 8) (\u201c[A]n application for\nthe writ is properly viewed as a belated extension of the original\nproceeding during which the error allegedly transpired\u201d). But we\nhave nonetheless suggested thatcoram nobisis a means of\n\u201ccollateral attack.\u201dMorgan,supra,at 510\u2013511\n(internal quotation marks omitted); see alsoRobinson, 361\nU. S., at 230, n.\u00a014. Similarly, a motion under 28 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a72255 (2006 ed., Supp. III) is entered on the docket of\nthe original criminal case and is typically referred to the judge\nwho originally presided over the challenged proceedings, see \u00a72255\nRules 3(b), 4(a), but there is no dispute that \u00a72255 proceedings\nare \u201ccollateral,\u201d see,e.g., Massarov.United\nStates,538 U.\nS. 500, 504 (2003) (describing \u00a72255 proceedings as\n\u201ccollateral\u201d);Danielsv.United States,532 U. S. 374, 379\n(2001) (same).[Footnote 7]Moreover, the methods of filing for\npostconviction or collateral review vary among the States. In the\nDistrict of Columbia and fourteen States, the principal\npostconviction remedy is part of the original case; in other\nStates, it is not. 1 Wilkes, State Postconviction Remedies and\nRelief Handbook \u00a71:3, at 6\u20137. Given the States\u2019 \u201cdifferent forms of\ncollateral review,\u201dDuncan, 533 U. S., at 177, the\nap-plication of AEDPA\u2019s tolling provision should not turn on such\nformalities. Seeibid.(\u201cCongress may have refrained from\nexclusive reliance on the term \u2018post-conviction\u2019 so as to leave no\ndoubt that the tolling provision applies to all types of state\ncollateral review available after a conviction\u201d).We thus define \u201ccollateral review\u201d according\nto its ordinary meaning: It refers to judicial review that occurs\nin a proceeding outside of the direct review process.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*For these reasons, the judgment\nof the Court of Appeals is affirmed.It is so ordered.Footnote 1This Rule provides in relevant part:\u201cThe court may correct an illegal sentence at any time. The\ncourt may correct a sentence imposed in an illegal manner and itmay reduce any sentencewhen a motion is filed within one\nhundred and twenty (120) days after the sentence is imposed, or\nwithin one hundred and twenty (120) days after receipt by the court\nof a mandate of the Supreme Court of Rhode Island issued upon\naffirmance of the judgment or dismissal of the appeal, or within\none hundred and twenty (120) days after receipt by the court of a\nmandate or order of the Supreme Court of the United States issued\nupon affirmance of the judgment, dismissal of the appeal, or denial\nof a writ of certiorari. The court shall act on the motion within a\nreasonable time, provided that any delay by the court in ruling on\nthe motion shall not prejudice the movant. The court may reduce a\nsentence, the execution of which has been suspended, upon\nrevocation of probation.\u201d R.\u00a0I. Super. Ct. Rule Crim. Proc.\n35(a) (2010) (emphasis added).Footnote 2CompareAlexanderv.Secretary,\nDept. of Corrections, 523 F.\u00a03d 1291, 1297 (CA11 2008)\n(motion to reduce sentence does not toll limitation period);Hartmannv.Carroll, 492 F.\u00a03d 478, 484 (CA3\n2007) (same);Walkowiakv.Haines, 272 F.\u00a03d\n234, 239 (CA4 2001) (same), with 582 F.\u00a03d, at 156 (case\nbelow) (motion to reduce sentence tolls);Robinsonv.Golder, 443 F.\u00a03d 718, 720\u2013721 (CA10 2006)(per\ncuriam)(same).Footnote 3We can imagine an argument that a Rhode\nIsland Rule 35 proceeding is in fact part of direct review under\n\u00a72244(d)(1) because, according to the parties, defendants in Rhode\nIsland cannot raise any challenge to their sentences on direct\nappeal; instead, they must bring a Rule 35 motion. See,e.g.,\nStatev.Day, 925 A. 2d 962, 985 (R. I. 2007) (\u201cIt is\nwell settled in this jurisdiction that a challenge to a criminal\nsentence must begin with the filing of a [Rule 35] motion \u2026\u00a0.\n[W]e will not consider the validity or legality of a sentence on\ndirect appeal unless extraordinary circumstances exist\u201d (internal\nquotation marks omitted));Statev.McManus, 990\nA. 2d 1229, 1238 (R. I. 2010) (refusing to consider Eighth\nAmendment challenge on direct review because \u201c[t]o challenge a\ncriminal sentence, the defendant must first file a motion to reduce\nin accordance with Rule 35\u201d); see alsoJimenezv.Quarterman,555 U. S. 113, ___ (2009) (slip op.,\nat 6\u20137). That issue has not been briefed or argued by the parties,\nhowever, and we express no opinion as to the merit of such an\nargument. Even if we were to assume that a Rhode Island Rule 35\nmotion is part of direct review, our disposition of this case would\nnot change: Respondent\u2019s habeas petition still would be timely,\nbecause the limitation period would not have begun to run until\nafter the Rule 35 proceedings concluded.Footnote 4A motion to reduce sentence is unlike a\nmotion for postconviction discovery or a motion for appointment of\ncounsel, which generally are not direct requests for judicial\nreview of a judgment and do not provide a state court with\nauthority to order relief from a judgment.Footnote 5E.g., Statev.Coleman, 984\nA.\u00a02d 650, 657 (R.\u00a0I. 2009) (\u201cGiven these factors, and\nthe trial justice\u2019s exhaustive explanation of her reasoning in\nsentencing Mr. Coleman, we hold it was not an abuse of her\ndiscretion to order Mr. Coleman to serve consecutive sentences\u201d);Statev.Ferrara, 818 A.\u00a02d 642, 645\n(R.\u00a0I. 2003)(per curiam)(\u201c[M]itigating\ncircumstances clearly are not present in this case\u201d);Statev.Rossi, 771 A.\u00a02d 906, 908\n(R.\u00a0I. 2001) (order) (\u201cBased upon [the court\u2019s] review of the\nrecord,\u201d the sentence \u201cwas not excessive and was justified under\nthe circumstances,\u201d namely, \u201cthe abhorrent conduct of [the]\ndefendant\u201d and \u201cthe permissible penalty range\u201d under the statute);Statev.Mollicone, 746 A.\u00a02d 135, 138\n(R.\u00a0I. 2000)(per curiam)(\u201c[T]he trial justice was\naware of these factors and applied them correctly\u201d).Footnote 6All of these provisions refer to a new rule\nof constitutional law made retroactively applicable by this Court\nto \u201ccases on collateral review.\u201dFootnote 7In other contexts not relevant here, there\nhas been some confusion over whether \u00a72255 proceedings are civil or\ncriminal in nature. See,e.g.,Postconviction Remedies\n\u00a73:5, p. 251 (2010) (\u201c[T]here is a dispute over whether the [\u00a72255]\nmotion initiates an independent civil action or, instead, is merely\na further step in the criminal prosecution\u201d); 3 C. Wright & S.\nWelling, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7622 (4th ed. 2011). We\nexpress no opinion on this question.",
