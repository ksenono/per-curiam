The Court Interpreters Act amended that\nstatute to include \u201ccompensation of interpreters.\u201d \u00a71920(6); see\nalso \u00a77, 92Stat. 2044. The question pre- sented in this case is\nwhether \u201ccompensation of interpreters\u201d covers the cost of\ntranslating documents. Because the ordinary meaning of the word\n\u201cinterpreter\u201d is a person who translates orally from one language\nto another, we hold that \u201ccompensation of interpreters\u201d is limited\nto the cost of oral translation and does not include the cost of\ndocument translation.IThis case arises from a personal injury action\nbrought by petitioner Kouichi Taniguchi, a professional baseball\nplayer in Japan, against respondent Kan Pacific Saipan, Ltd., the\nowner of a resort in the Northern Mariana Islands. Petitioner was\ninjured when his leg broke through a wooden deck during a tour of\nrespondent\u2019s resort prop- erty. Initially, petitioner said that he\nneeded no medical attention, but two weeks later, he informed\nrespondent that he had suffered cuts, bruises, and torn ligaments\nfrom the accident. Due to these alleged injuries, he claimed\ndamages for medical expenses and for lost income from contracts he\nwas unable to honor. After discovery concluded, both parties moved\nfor summary judgment. The United States District Court for the\nNorthern Ma- riana Islands granted respondent\u2019s motion on the\nground that petitioner offered no evidence that respondent knew of\nthe defective deck or otherwise failed to exercise reasonable\ncare.In preparing its defense, respondent paid to\nhave various documents translated from Japanese to English. After\nthe District Court granted summary judgment in respondent\u2019s favor,\nrespondent submitted a bill for those costs. Over petitioner\u2019s\nobjection, the District Court awarded the costs to respondent as\n\u201ccompensation of interpreters\u201d under \u00a71920(6). Explaining that\ninterpreter services \u201ccan- not be separated into \u2018translation\u2019 and\n\u2018interpretation,\u2019\u00a0\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 25a, the court held\nthat costs for document translation \u201cfal[l] within the meaning of\n\u2018compensation of an interpreter,\u2019\u00a0\u201dibid.Finding that\nit was necessary for respondent to have the documents translated in\norder to depose petitioner, the court con- cluded that the\ntranslation services were properly taxed as costs.The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth\nCircuit affirmed both the District Court\u2019s grant of summary\njudgment and its award of costs. The court rejected petitioner\u2019s\nargument that the cost of document translation services is not\nrecoverable as \u201ccompensation of interpreters.\u201d The court explained\nthat \u201cthe word \u2018interpreter\u2019 can reasonably encompass a\n\u2018translator,\u2019 both according to the dictionary definition and\ncommon usage of these terms, which does not always draw precise\ndistinctions between foreign language interpretations involving\nlive speech versus written documents.\u201d 633 F.3d 1218, 1221 (2011).\n\u201cMore importantly,\u201d the court stressed, this construction of the\nstatute \u201cis more compatible with Rule 54 of the Fed- eral Rules of\nCivil Procedure, which includes a decided preference for the award\nof costs to the prevailing party.\u201dIbid.The court thus\nconcluded that \u201cthe prevailing party should be awarded costs for\nservices required to interpret either live speech or written\ndocuments into a familiar language, so long as interpretation of\nthe items is necessary to the litigation.\u201dId.,at\n1221\u20131222.Because there is a split among the Courts of\nAppeals on this issue,[1] we\ngranted certiorari. 564 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2011).IIAAlthough the taxation of costs was not allowed\nat common law, it was the practice of federal courts in the early\nyears to award costs in the same manner as the courts of the\nrelevant forum State.Alyeska Pipeline Service Co.v.Wilderness Society,421 U.S.\n240, 247\u2013248 (1975). In 1793, Congress enacted a statute that\nauthorized the awarding of certain costs to prevailing parties\nbased on state law:\u201cThat there be allowed and taxed in the\nsupreme, circuit and district courts of the United States, in\nfavour of the parties obtaining judgments therein, such\ncompensation for their travel and attendance, and for attornies and\ncounsellors\u2019 fees .\u00a0.\u00a0. as are allowed in the supreme or\nsuperior courts of the respective states.\u201d Act of Mar. 1, 1793, \u00a74,\n1Stat. 333.Although twice reenacted, this provision expired\nin 1799.Alyeska Pipeline,supra, at 248, n.\u00a019;Crawford Fitting Co.v.J.T. Gibbons,\nInc.,482 U.S.\n437, 439 (1987). Yet even in the absence of express legislative\nauthorization, the practice of referring to state rules for the\ntaxation of costs persisted. SeeAlyeska Pipeline, 421\nU.\u00a0S., at 250.Not until 1853 did Congress enact legislation\nspecifying the costs allowable in federal court.Id.,at\n251. The impetus for a uniform federal rule was largely the\nconsequence of two developments. First, a \u201cgreat diversity in\npractice among the courts\u201d had emerged.Ibid.Second,\n\u201closing litigants were being unfairly saddled with exorbitant fees\nfor the victor\u2019s attorney.\u201dIbid.Against this backdrop,\nCongress passed the 1853 Fee Act, which we have described as a\n\u201cfar-reaching Act specifying in detail the nature and amount of the\ntaxable items of cost in the federal courts.\u201dId.,at\n251\u2013252. The substance of this Act was transmitted through the\nRevised Statutes of 1874 and the Judicial Code of 1911 to the\nRevised Code of 1948, where it was codified, \u201cwithout any apparent\nintent to change the controlling rules,\u201d as 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a71920. 421 U.\u00a0S., at 255.Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(d) gives\ncourts the discretion to award costs to prevailing parties. That\nRule provides in relevant part: \u201cUnless a federal statute, these\nrules, or a court order provides otherwise, costs\u2014other than\nattorney\u2019s fees\u2014should be allowed to the prevailing party.\u201d Rule\n54(d)(1). We have held that \u201c\u00a71920 defines the term \u2018costs\u2019 as used\nin Rule 54(d).\u201dCrawford Fitting, 482 U.\u00a0S., at 441. In\nso doing, we rejected the view that \u201cthe discretion granted by Rule\n54(d) is a separate source of power to tax as costs expenses not\nenumerated in \u00a71920.\u201dIbid.As originally configured, \u00a71920 contained five\ncategories of taxable costs: (1) \u201c[f]ees of the clerk and marshal\u201d;\n(2) \u201c[f]ees of the court reporter for all or any part of the steno-\ngraphic transcript necessarily obtained for use in the case\u201d; (3)\n\u201c[f]ees and disbursements for printing and witnesses\u201d; (4) \u201c[f]ees\nfor exemplification and copies of papers necessarily obtained for\nuse in the case\u201d; and (5) \u201c[d]ocket fees under section 1923 of this\ntitle.\u201d 62Stat. 955. In 1978, Congress enacted the Court\nInterpreters Act, which amended \u00a71920 to add a sixth category:\n\u201cCompensation of court appointed experts, compensation of\ninterpreters, and salaries, fees, expenses, and costs of special\ninterpretation services under section 1828 of this title.\u201d 28\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71920(6); see also \u00a77, 92Stat. 2044. We are\nconcerned here with this sixth category, specifically the item of\ntax- able costs identified as \u201ccompensation of interpreters.\u201dBTo determine whether the item \u201ccompensation of\ninterpreters\u201d includes costs for document translation, we must look\nto the meaning of \u201cinterpreter.\u201d That term is not defined in the\nCourt Interpreters Act or in any other relevant statutory\nprovision. When a term goes undefined in a statute, we give the\nterm its ordinary meaning.Asgrow Seed Co.v.Winterboer,513 U.S.\n179, 187 (1995). The question here is: What is the ordinary\nmeaning of \u201cinterpreter\u201d?Many dictionaries in use when Congress enacted\nthe Court Interpreters Act in 1978 defined \u201cinterpreter\u201d as one who\ntranslates spoken, as opposed to written, language. The American\nHeritage Dictionary, for instance, defined the term as \u201c[o]ne who\ntranslates orally from one language into another.\u201d American\nHeritage Dictionary 685 (1978). The Scribner-Bantam English\nDictionary defined the related word \u201cinterpret\u201d as \u201cto translate\norally.\u201d Scribner-Bantam English Dictionary 476 (1977). Similarly,\nthe Random House Dictionary defined the intransitive form of\n\u201cinterpret\u201d as \u201cto translate what issaidin a foreign\nlanguage.\u201d Random House Dictionary of the English Language 744\n(1973) (emphasis added). And, notably, the Oxford English\nDictionary defined \u201cinterpreter\u201d as \u201c[o]ne who translates\nlanguages,\u201d but then divided that definition into two senses: \u201ca.\n[a] translator of books or writings,\u201d which it designated as\nobsolete, and \u201cb. [o]ne who translates the communications of\npersons speaking different languages;spec.one whose office\nit is to do so orally in the presence of the persons; a dragoman.\u201d\n5 Oxford English Dictionary 416 (1933); see also Concise Oxford\nDictionary of Current English 566 (6th ed. 1976) (\u201cOne who\ninterprets; one whose office it is to translate the words of\npersons speaking different languages, esp. orally in their\npresence\u201d); Chambers Twentieth Century Dictionary 686 (1973) (\u201cone\nwho translates orally for the benefit of two or more parties\nspeaking different languages: .\u00a0.\u00a0. a translator\n(obs.)\u201d).Pre-1978 legal dictionaries also generally\ndefined the words \u201cinterpreter\u201d and \u201cinterpret\u201d in terms of oral\ntranslation. The then-current edition of Black\u2019s Law Dictionary,\nfor example, defined \u201cinterpreter\u201d as \u201c[a] person sworn at a trial\nto interpret the evidence of a foreigner .\u00a0.\u00a0. to the\ncourt,\u201d and it defined \u201cinterpret\u201d in relevant part as \u201cto\ntranslate orally from one tongue to another.\u201d Black\u2019s Law\nDictionary 954, 953 (rev. 4th ed. 1968); see also W. Anderson, A\nDictionary of Law 565 (1888) (\u201cOne who translates the testimony of\nwitnesses speaking a foreign tongue, for the benefit of the court\nand jury\u201d); 1 B. Abbott, Dictionary of Terms and Phrases Used in\nAmerican or English Jurisprudence 639 (1878) (\u201cone who restates the\ntestimony of a witness testifying in a foreign tongue, to the court\nand jury, in their language\u201d). But see Ballentine\u2019s Law Dictionary\n655, 654 (3d ed. 1969) (defining \u201cinterpreter\u201d as \u201c[o]ne who\ninterprets, particularly one who interprets words written or spoken\nin a foreign language,\u201d and \u201cinterpret\u201d as \u201cto translate from a\nforeign language\u201d).Against these authorities, respondent relies\nalmost exclusively on Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary\n(hereinafter Webster\u2019s Third). The version of that dictionary in\nprint when Congress enacted the Court Interpreters Act defined\n\u201cinterpreter\u201d as \u201cone that translates;esp: a person who\ntranslates orally for parties conversing in different tongues.\u201d\nWebster\u2019s Third 1182 (1976).[2]\nThe sense divideresp(for especially) indicates that the\nmost common meaning of the term is one \u201cwho translates orally,\u201d but\nthat meaning is subsumed within the more general definition \u201cone\nthat translates.\u201d See 12,000 Words: A Supplement to Webster\u2019s Third\n15a (1986) (explaining thatesp\u201cis used to introduce the\nmost common meaning included in the more general preceding\ndefinition\u201d). For respondent, the general definition suf- fices to\nestablish that the term \u201cinterpreter\u201d ordinarily includes persons\nwho translate the written word. Explaining that \u201cthe word\n\u2018interpreter\u2019 can reasonably encompass a \u2018translator,\u2019\u00a0\u201d the\nCourt of Appeals reached the same conclusion. 633 F.\u00a03d, at\n1221. We disagree.That a definition is broad enough to encompass\none sense of a word does not establish that the word isordinarilyunderstood in that sense. SeeMallardv.United States Dist. Court for Southern Dist. of Iowa,490 U.S.\n296, 301 (1989) (relying on the \u201cmost common meaning\u201d and the\n\u201cordinary and natural signification\u201d of the word \u201crequest,\u201d even\nthough it may sometimes \u201cdouble for \u2018demand\u2019 or \u2018command\u2019\u00a0\u201d).\nThe fact that the definition of \u201cinterpreter\u201d in Webster\u2019s Third\nhas a sense divider denoting the most common usage suggests that\nother usages, although acceptable, might not be common or ordinary.\nIt is telling that all the dictionaries cited above defined\n\u201cinterpreter\u201d at the time of the statute\u2019s enactment as including\npersons who translate orally, but only a handful defined the word\nbroadly enough to encompass translators of written material. Seesupra,at 5\u20137. Although the Oxford English Dictionary, one\nof the most authoritative on the English language, recognized that\n\u201cinterpreter\u201dcanmean one who translates writings, it\nexpressly designated that meaning as obsolete. Seesupra,at\n6. Were the meaning of \u201cinterpreter\u201d that respondent advocates\ntruly common or ordinary, we would expect to see more support for\nthat meaning. We certainly would not expect to see it designated as\nobsolete in the Oxford English Dictionary. Any definition of a word\nthat is absent from many dictionaries and is deemed obsolete in\nothers is hardly a common or ordinary meaning.Based on our survey of the relevant\ndictionaries, we conclude that the ordinary or common meaning of\n\u201cinterpreter\u201d does not include those who translate writings.\nInstead, we find that an interpreter is normally understood as one\nwho translates orally from one language to another. This sense of\nthe word is far more natural. As the Seventh Circuit put it:\n\u201cRobert Fagles made famous translations into English of theIliad, theOdyssey, and theAeneid, but no one\nwould refer to him as an English-language \u2018interpreter\u2019 of these\nworks.\u201dExtra Equipamentos E Exporta\u00e7\u00e3o Ltda.v.Case\nCorp., 541 F.3d 719, 727 (2008).To be sure, the word \u201cinterpreter\u201d can encompass\npersons who translate documents, but because that is not the\nordinary meaning of the word, it does not control unless the\ncontext in which the word appears indicates that it does. Nothing\nin the Court Interpreters Act or in \u00a71920, however, even hints that\nCongress intended to go beyond the ordinary meaning of\n\u201cinterpreter\u201d and to embrace the broadest possible meaning that the\ndefinition of the word can bear.If anything, the statutory context suggests the\nopposite: that the word \u201cinterpreter\u201d applies only to those who\ntranslate orally. As previously mentioned, Congress en- acted\n\u00a71920(6) as part of the Court Interpreters Act. The main provision\nof that Act is \u00a72(a), codified in 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a71827 and\n1828. See 92Stat. 2040\u20132042. Particularly relevant here is \u00a71827.\nAs it now reads, that statute provides for the establishment of \u201ca\nprogram to facilitate the use of certified and otherwise qualified\ninterpreters in judicial proceedings instituted by the United\nStates.\u201d \u00a71827(a). Subsection (d) directs courts to use an\ninterpreter in any criminal or civil action instituted by the\nUnited States if a party or witness \u201cspeaks only or primarily a\nlanguage other than the English language\u201d or \u201csuffers from a\nhearing impairment\u201d \u201cso as to inhibit such party\u2019s comprehension of\nthe proceedings or communication with counsel or the presiding\njudicial officer, or so as to inhibit such witness\u2019 comprehension\nof questions and the presentation of such testimony.\u201d\n\u00a71827(d)(1).[3] As originally\nenacted, subsection (k) mandated that the \u201cinterpretation provided\nby certified interpreters .\u00a0.\u00a0. shall be in the\nconsecutive mode except that the presiding judicial officer\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. may authorize a simultaneous or summary\ninterpretation.\u201d \u00a71827(k) (1976 ed., Supp. II); see also 92Stat.\n2042. In its current form, subsection (k) provides that\ninterpretation \u201cshall be in the simultaneous mode for any party\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. and in the consecutive mode for witnesses,\u201d unless\nthe court directs otherwise. The simultaneous, consecutive, and\nsummary modes are all methods of oral interpretation and have\nnothing to do with the translation of writings.[4] Taken together, these provisions are a strong\ncontextual clue that Congress was dealing only with oral\ntranslation in the Court Interpreters Act and that it intended to\nuse the term \u201cinterpreter\u201d throughout the Act in its ordinary sense\nas someone who translates the spoken word. As we have said before,\nit is a \u201c\u00a0\u2018normal rule of statutory construction\u2019 that\n\u2018identical words used in different parts of the same act are\nintended to have the same meaning.\u2019\u00a0\u201dGustafsonv.Alloyd Co.,513 U.S.\n561, 570 (1995) (quotingDepartment of Revenue of Ore.v.ACF Industries, Inc.,510 U.S.\n332, 342 (1994)).[5]The references to technical terminology in the\nCourt Interpreters Act further suggest that Congress used\n\u201cinterpreter\u201d in a technical sense, and it is therefore significant\nthat relevant professional literature draws a line between\n\u201cinterpreters,\u201d who \u201care used for oral conversations,\u201d and\n\u201ctranslators,\u201d who \u201care used for written communications.\u201d Zazueta,supran.\u00a04, at 477; see also M. Frankenthaler, Skills\nfor Bilingual Legal Personnel 67 (1982) (\u201cWhile the translator\ndeals with the written word, the interpreter is concerned with the\nspoken language\u201d); Brislin, Introduction, in Translation:\nApplications and Research 1 (R. Brislin ed. 1976) (explaining that\nwhen both terms are used together, translation \u201crefers to the\nprocessing [of] written input, and interpretation to the processing\nof oral input\u201d (emphasis deleted)); J. Herbert, Interpreter\u2019s\nHandbook 1 (2d ed. 1952) (\u201cIn the present-day jargon of\ninternational organisations, the words translate, translations,\ntranslator are used when the immediate result of the work is a\nwritten text; and the words interpret, interpreter, interpretation\nwhen it is a speech delivered orally\u201d). That Congress specified\n\u201cinterpreters\u201d but not \u201ctranslators\u201d is yet another signal that it\nintended to limit \u00a71920(6) to the costs of oral, instead of\nwritten, translation.[6]In sum, both the ordinary and technical meanings\nof \u201cinterpreter,\u201d as well as the statutory context in which the\nword is found, lead to the conclusion that \u00a71920(6) does not apply\nto translators of written materials.[7]CNo other rule of construction compels us to\ndepart from the ordinary meaning of \u201cinterpreter.\u201d The Court of\nAppeals reasoned that a broader meaning is \u201cmore compat- ible with\nRule 54 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which includes a\ndecided preference for the award of costs to the prevailing party.\u201d\n633 F.\u00a03d, at 1221. But we have never held that Rule 54(d)\ncreates a presumption of statutory construction in favor of the\nbroadest possible reading of the costs enumerated in \u00a71920. To the\ncontrary, we have made clear that the \u201cdiscretion granted by Rule\n54(d) is not a power to evade\u201d the specific categories of costs set\nforth by Congress.Crawford Fitting, 482 U.\u00a0S., at 442.\n\u201cRather,\u201d we have said, \u201cit is solely a power to decline to tax, as\ncosts, the items enumerated in \u00a71920.\u201dIbid.Rule 54(d) thus\nprovides no sound basis for casting aside the ordinary meaning of\nthe various items enumerated in the costs statute, including the\nordinary meaning of \u201cinterpreter.\u201dOur decision is in keeping with the narrow scope\nof taxable costs. \u201cAlthough \u2018costs\u2019 has an everyday meaning\nsynonymous with \u2018expenses,\u2019 the concept of taxable costs under Rule\n54(d) is more limited and represents those expenses, including, for\nexample, court fees, that a court will assess against a litigant.\u201d\n10 C. Wright, A. Miller, & M. Kane, Federal Practice and\nProcedure \u00a72666, pp. 202\u2013203 (3d ed. 1998) (hereinafter Wright\n& Miller). Taxable costs are limited to relatively minor,\nincidental expenses as is evident from \u00a71920, which lists such\nitems as clerk fees, court reporter fees, expenses for printing and\nwitnesses, expenses for exemplification and copies, docket fees,\nand compensation of court-appointed experts. Indeed, \u201cthe\nassessment of costs most often is merely a clerical matter that can\nbe done by the court clerk.\u201dHairline Creations, Inc.v.Kefalas, 664 F.2d 652, 656 (CA7 1981). Taxable costs are a\nfraction of the nontaxable expenses borne by litigants for\nattorneys, experts, consultants, and investigators. It comes as\nlittle surprise, therefore, that \u201ccosts almost always amount to\nless than the successful litigant\u2019s total expenses in connection\nwith a lawsuit.\u201d 10 Wright & Miller \u00a72666, at 203. Because\ntaxable costs are limited by statute and are modest in scope, we\nsee no compelling reason to stretch the ordinary meaning of the\ncost items Congress authorized in \u00a71920.As for respondent\u2019s extratextual arguments, they\nare more properly directed at Congress. Respondent contends that\ndocumentary evidence is no less important than testimonial evidence\nand that it would be anomalous to require the losing party to cover\ntranslation costs for spoken words but not for written words. Brief\nfor Respondent 20. Respondent also observes that some translation\ntasks are not entirely oral or entirely written.Id.,at\n20\u201324. One task, called \u201c\u00a0\u2018sight translation,\u2019\u00a0\u201d involves\nthe oral translation of a document.Id.,at 21. Another task\ninvolves the written translation of speech.Ibid.And a\nthird task, called \u201c\u00a0\u2018document comparison,\u2019\u00a0\u201d involves\ncomparing documents in the source and target language to verify\nthat the two are identical.Id.,at 21\u201322. Respondent argues\nthat a narrow definition cannot account for these variations and\nthat a bright-line definition of \u201cinterpreter\u201d as someone who\ntranslates spoken and written words would avoid complication and\nprovide a simple, administrable rule for district courts.Neither of these arguments convinces us that\nCongress must have intended to dispense with the ordinary meaning\nof \u201cinterpreter\u201d in \u00a71920(6). First, Congress might have\ndistinguished between oral and written translation out of a concern\nthat requiring losing parties to bear the potentially sizable costs\nof translating discovery docu- ments, as opposed to the more\nlimited costs of oral tes- timony, could be too burdensome and\npossibly unfair, especially for litigants with limited means. Cf.Fleischmann Distilling Corp.v.Maier Brewing Co.,386 U.S.\n714, 718 (1967) (noting the argument \u201cthat since litigation is\nat best uncertain one should not be penalized for merely defending\nor prosecuting a lawsuit, and that the poor might be unjustly\ndiscouraged from instituting actions to vindicate their rights if\nthe penalty for losing included the fees of their opponents\u2019\ncounsel\u201d). Congress might also have concluded that a document\ntranslator is more akin to an expert or consultant retained by a\nparty to decipher documentary evidence\u2014like, for instance, a\nforensic accountant\u2014than to an interpreter whose real-time oral\ntranslation services are necessary for communication between\nlitigants, witnesses, and the court.[8]Second, respondent has not shown that any of the\nhybrid translation/interpretation tasks to which it points actually\narise with overwhelming frequency or that the problem of drawing\nthe line between taxable and nontax- able costs in such cases will\nvex the trial courts. It certainly has not shown that any such\nproblems will be more troublesome than the task of sifting through\ntranslated discovery documents to ascertain which can be taxed as\nnecessary to the litigation. In any event, the present case does\nnot present a hybrid situation; it involves purely written\ntranslation, which falls outside the tasks performed by an\n\u201cinterpreter\u201d as that term is ordinarily understood.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*Because the ordinary meaning of \u201cinterpreter\u201d\nis someone who translates orally from one language to another, we\nhold that the category \u201ccompensation of interpreters\u201d in \u00a71920(6)\ndoes not include costs for document translation. We therefore\nvacate the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the\nNinth Circuit and remand the case for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.Notes1CompareBDT Products,\nInc.v.Lexmark Int\u2019l, Inc.,405 F.3d 415, 419 (CA6 2005) (holding that document translation\ncosts are taxable under \u00a71920(6) because the \u201cdefinition of\ninterpret expressly includes to \u2018translate into intelligible or\nfamiliar language\u2019\u00a0\u201d (quoting Webster\u2019s Third New\nInternational Dictionary 1182 (1981))), withExtra Equipamentos\nE Exporta\u00e7\u00e3o Ltda.v.Case Corp., 541 F.3d 719, 727\u2013728\n(CA7 2008) (holding that document translation costs are not taxable\nunder \u00a71920(6) because an interpreter is \u201cnormally understood [as]\na person who translates living speech from one language to\nanother\u201d).2A handful of other\ncontemporaneous dictionaries used a similar formulation. See Funk\n& Wagnalls New Comprehensive International Dictionary of the\nEnglish Language 665 (1977) (\u201cOne who interprets or translates;\nspecifically, one who serves as oral translator between people\nspeaking different languages\u201d); 1 World Book Dictionary 1103 (C.\nBarnhart & R. Barnhart eds. 1977) (\u201ca person whose business is\ntranslating, especially orally, from a foreign language\u201d);\nCassell\u2019s English Dictionary 617 (4th ed. 1969) (\u201cOne who\ninterprets, esp. one employed to translate orally to persons\nspeaking a foreign language\u201d).3This provision remains\nsubstantially the same as it appeared when first enacted. See 28\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71827(d)(1) (1976 ed., Supp. II); see also\n92Stat. 2040.4The simultaneous mode\nrequires the interpreter \u201cto interpret and to speak\ncontemporaneously with the individual whose communication is being\ntranslated.\u201d H.\u00a0R. Rep. No. 95\u20131687, p.\u00a08 (1978). The\nconsecutive mode requires the speaker whose communication is being\ntranslated to pause so that the interpreter can \u201cconvey the\ntestimony given.\u201dIbid.And the summary mode \u201callow[s] the\ninterpreter to condense and distill the speech of the speaker.\u201dIbid.;see generally Zazueta, Attorneys Guide to the Use of\nCourt Interpreters, 8 U. C. D. L.\u00a0Rev. 471, 477\u2013478\n(1975).5The dissent agrees that\ncontext should help guide our analysis, but instead of looking to\nthe Court Interpreters Act, it looks to \u201cthe practice of federal\ncourts both before and after \u00a71920(6)\u2019s enactment.\u201dPost,at\n4 (opinion of Ginsburg, J.). The practice of federal courtsafterthe Act\u2019s enactment tells us nothing about what\nCongress intended at the time of enactment. And federal court\npracticebeforethe Act under other provisions of \u00a71920\ntells us little, if anything, about what Congress intended when it\nadded subsection (6). We think the statutory context in which the\nword \u201cinterpreter\u201d appears is a more reliable guide to its\nmeaning.6Some provisions within\nthe United States Code use both \u201cinter-preter\u201d and \u201ctranslator\u201d\ntogether, thus implying that Congress understands the terms to have\nthe distinct meanings described above. See,e.g.,8\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71555(b) (providing that appropriations for the\nImmigration and Naturalization Service \u201cshall be available for\npayment of .\u00a0.\u00a0. interpreters and translators who are not\ncitizens of the United States\u201d); 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7530C(b)(1)(I) (providing that Department of Justice funds may be\nused for \u201c[p]ayment of interpreters and translators who are not\ncitizens of the United States\u201d).7Our conclusion is\nbuttressed by respondent\u2019s concession at oral argument that there\nis no provision in the United States Code where it is clear that\nthe word extends to those who translate documents. Tr. of Oral Arg.\n39; see also Brief for Petitioner 32 (\u201cAnd the Code is wholly\ndevoid of any corresponding definition of \u2018interpreter\u2019 extending\nto the translation of written documents\u201d). As respondent\nacknowledged, either the word is used in a context that strongly\nsuggests it applies only to oral translation or its meaning is\nunclear. See Tr. of OralArg. 38.8The dissent contends that\ndocument translation, no less than oral translation, is essential\n\u201cto equip the parties to present their case clearly and the court\nto decide the merits intelligently.\u201dPost,at 5. But a\ndocument translator is no more important than an expert or\nconsultant in making sense of otherwise incomprehensible\ndocumentary evidence, yet expenses for experts and consultants are\ngenerally not taxable as costs. To be sure, forgoing document\ntranslation can impair a litigant\u2019s case, but document translation\nis not indispensable, in the way oral translation is, to the\nparties\u2019 ability to communicate with each other, with witnesses,\nand with the court.",
