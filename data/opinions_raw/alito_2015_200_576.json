Under\nour First Amendment cases, the distinction between government\nspeech and private speech is critical. The First Amendment \u201cdoes\nnot regulate government speech,\u201d and therefore when government\nspeaks, it is free \u201cto select the views that it wants to express.\u201dPleasant Grove Cityv.Summum, 555 U. S. 460 \u2013468\n(2009). By contrast, \u201c[i]n the realm of private speech or\nexpression, government regulation may not favor one speaker over\nanother.\u201dRosenbergerv.Rector and Visitors of Univ. of\nVa., 515 U. S. 819, 828 (1995) .Unfortunately, the Court\u2019s decision categorizes\nprivate speech as government speech and thus strips it of all First\nAmendment protection. The Court holds that all the privately\ncreated messages on the many specialty plates issued by the State\nof Texas convey a government message rather than the message of the\nmotorist displaying the plate. Can this possibly be correct?Here is a test. Suppose you sat by the side of a\nTexas highway and studied the license plates on the vehicles\npassing by. You would see, in addition to the standard Texas\nplates, an impressive array of specialty plates. (There are now\nmore than 350 varieties.) You would likely observe plates that\nhonor numerous colleges and universities. You might see plates\nbearing the name of a high school, a fraternity or sorority, the\nMasons, the Knights of Columbus, the Daughters of the American\nRevolution, a realty company, a favorite soft drink, a favorite\nburger restaurant, and a favorite NASCAR driver.As you sat there watching these plates speed by,\nwould you really think that the sentiments reflected in these\nspecialty plates are the views of the State of Texas and not those\nof the owners of the cars? If a car with a plate that says \u201cRather\nBe Golfing\u201d passed by at 8:30 am on a Monday morning, would you\nthink: \u201cThis is the official policy of the State\u2014better to golf\nthan to work?\u201d If you did your viewing at the start of the college\nfootball season and you saw Texas plates with the names of the\nUniversity of Texas\u2019s out-of-state competitors in upcoming\ngames\u2014Notre Dame, Oklahoma State, the University of Okla-homa,\nKansas State, Iowa State\u2014would you assume that the State of Texas\nwas officially (and perhaps treasonously) rooting for the\nLonghorns\u2019 opponents? And when a car zipped by with a plate that\nreads \u201cNASCAR \u2013 24 Jeff Gordon,\u201d would you think that Gordon (born\nin California, raised in Indiana, resides in North\nCarolina)[1] is the official\nfavorite of the State government?The Court says that all of these messages are\ngovernment speech. It is essential that government be able to\nexpress its own viewpoint, the Court reminds us, because otherwise,\nhow would it promote its programs, like recycling and vaccinations?Ante, at 5\u20136. So when Texas issues a \u201cRather Be Golfing\u201d\nplate, but not a \u201cRather Be Playing Tennis\u201d or \u201cRather Be Bowling\u201d\nplate, it is furthering a state policy to promote golf but not\ntennis or bowling. And when Texas allows motorists to obtain a\nNotre Dame license plate but not a University of South-ern\nCalifornia plate, it is taking sides in that long-time rivalry.This capacious understanding of government\nspeech takes a large and painful bite out of the First Amendment.\nSpecialty plates may seem innocuous. They make motorists happy, and\nthey put money in a State\u2019s coffers. But the precedent this case\nsets is dangerous. While all license plates unquestionably containsomegovernment speech (e.g.,the name of the State\nand the numbers and/or letters identifying the vehicle), the State\nof Texas has converted the remaining space on its specialty plates\ninto little mobile billboards on which motorists can display their\nown messages. And what Texas did here was to reject one of the\nmessages that members of a privategroup wanted to post on some of\nthese little billboards be-cause the State thought that many of its\ncitizens would find the message offensive. That is blatant\nviewpoint discrimination.If the State can do this with its little mobile\nbillboards, could it do the same with big, stationary billboards?\nSuppose that a State erected electronic billboards along its\nhighways. Suppose that the State posted some government messages on\nthese billboards and then, to raise money, allowed private entities\nand individuals to purchase the right to post their own messages.\nAnd suppose that the State allowed only those messages that it\nliked or found not too controversial. Would that be\nconstitutional?What if a state college or university did the\nsame thing with a similar billboard or a campus bulletin board or\ndorm list serve? What if it allowed private messages that are\nconsistent with prevailing views on campus but banned those that\ndisturbed some students or faculty? Can there be any doubt that\nthese examples of viewpoint discrimination would violate the First\nAmendment? I hope not, but the future uses of today\u2019s precedent\nremain to be seen.IASpecialty plates like those involved in this\ncase are a recent development. License plates originated solely as\na means of identifying vehicles. In 1901, New York became the first\nState to require automobiles to be licensed, but rather than issue\nlicense plates itself, New York required drivers to display their\ninitials on their cars. J. Minard & T. Stentiford, A Moving\nHistory 50 (2004). Two years later, Massachusetts became the first\nState to issue license plates. The plates said \u201cMass. Automobile\nRegister\u201d and displayed the vehicle\u2019s registration number.Id., at 51. Plates of this type\u2014featuring a registration\nnumber, the name of the State, and sometimes the date\u2014were the\nstandard for decades thereafter. Seeid., at 52\u201394; see also\ngenerally, J. Fox, License Plates of the United States 10\u201399\n(1997).Texas license plates initially followed this\npattern. When the first official state plate appeared in 1917, it\nfeatured a number and the abbreviation \u201cTEX.\u201d Texas Department of\nTransportation, The History of Texas License Plates 9 (1999)\n(History). In 1925, the year of issue was added, and the State\nbegan issuing plates that identified certain vehicle types,e.g., \u201cC-M\u201d for commercial trucks (1925),id., at\n14\u201315; \u201cFARM\u201d for farm trucks (1935),id., at 22;\n\u201cOverwidth\u201d (1949),id., at 32; \u201cHouse Trailer\u201d (1951),id., at 36. In 1936, a special plate with the word\n\u201cCENTENNIAL\u201d was created to mark the State\u2019s 100th birthday, and\nthe first plate identifying the owner as a \u201cState Official\u201d\nappeared two years later.Id., at 20, 25. Starting in the\n1950\u2019s, Texas began issuing plates to identify some other\nregistrants, such as \u201cAmateur Radio Operator\u201d (1954),id.,\nat 38, \u201cState Judge\u201d (1970)id., at 64; and \u201cDisabled\nVeteran,\u201d (1972),id., at 79.A sesquicentennial plate appeared in 1985, and\ntwo years later, legislation was introduced to create a bronze\nlicense plate with 14-karat gold-plated lettering, available for a\nfee of $1,000.Id., at 81. The proposal aimed to make the\nState a profit, but it failed to pass.Ibid.It was not until 1989 that anything that might\nbe considered a message was featured regularly on Texas plates. The\nwords \u201cThe Lone Star State\u201d were added \u201cas a means of bringing\nfavorable recognition to Texas.\u201dId., at 82.Finally, in the late 1990\u2019s, license plates\ncontaining a small variety of messages, selected by the State,\nbecame available for the first time.Id., at 101. These\nmessages included slogans like \u201cRead to Succeed,\u201d \u201cKeep Texas\nBeautiful,\u201d \u201cAnimal Friendly,\u201d \u201cBig Bend National Park,\u201d \u201cHouston\nLivestock Show and Rodeo,\u201d and \u201cLone Star Proud.\u201dId.,at\n101, 113. Also issued in the 1990\u2019s were plates bearing the names\nof colleges and universities, and some plates (e.g., \u201cState\nof the Arts,\u201d \u201cState Capitol Restoration\u201d) were made available to\nraise funds for special purposes.Id.,101.Once the idea of specialty plates took hold, the\nnumber of varieties quickly multiplied, and today, we are told,\nTexas motorists can choose from more than 350 messages, including\nmany designs proposed by nonprofit groups or by individuals and\nfor-profit businesses through the State\u2019s third-party vendor. Brief\nfor Respondents at 2; see also Texas Department of Motor Vehicles,\nonline at\nhttp://www.txdmv.gov\u00a0/\u00a0motorists\u00a0/\u00a0license-plates\u00a0/\u00a0specialty\u00a0-\u00a0license-plates\n(all Internet materials as visited June 12, 2015,and available in\nClerk of Court\u2019s case file); http://www.myplates.com.Drivers can select plates advertising\norganizations and causes like 4\u2013H, the Boy Scouts, the American\nLegion, Be a Blood Donor, the Girl Scouts, Insure Texas Kids,\nMothers Against Drunk Driving, Marine Mammal Recovery, Save Texas\nOcelots, Share the Road, Texas Reads, Texas Realtors (\u201cI am a Texas\nRealtor\u201d), the Texas State Rifle Association (\u201cWWW.TSRA.COM\u201d), the\nTexas Trophy Hunters Association, the World Wildlife Fund, the\nYMCA, and Young Lawyers.[2]There are plates for fraternities and sororities\nand for in-state schools, both public (like Texas A & M and\nTexas Tech) and private (like Trinity University and Baylor). An\neven larger number of schools from out-of-state are honored:\nArizona State, Brigham Young, Florida State, Michigan State,\nAlabama, and South Carolina, to name only a few.There are political slogans, like \u201cCome and Take\nIt\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t Tread on Me,\u201d and plates promoting the citrus\nindustry and the \u201cCotton Boll.\u201d Commercial businesses can have\nspecialty plates, too. There are plates advertising Remax (\u201cGet It\nSold with Remax\u201d), Dr. Pepper (\u201cAlways One of a Kind\u201d), and Mighty\nFine Burgers.BThe Texas Division of Sons of Confederate\nVeterans (SCV) is an organization composed of descendants of\nConfederate soldiers. The group applied for a Texas specialty\nlicense plate in 2009 and again in 2010. Their proposed design\nfeatured a controversial symbol, the Confederate battle flag,\nsurrounded by the words \u201cSons of Confederate Veterans 1896\u201d and a\ngold border. App. 29. The Texas Department of Motor Vehicles Board\n(or Board) invited public comments and considered the plate design\nat a meeting in April 2011. At that meeting, one board member was\nabsent, and the remaining eight members deadlocked on whether to\napprove the plate. The Board thus reconsidered the plate at its\nmeeting in November 2011. This time, many opponents of the plate\nturned out to voice objections. The Board then voted unanimously\nagainst approval and issued an order stating:\u201cThe Board has considered the information\nand finds it necessary to deny this plate design application,\nspecifically the confederate flag portion of the design, because\npublic comments have shown that many members of the general public\nfind the design offensive, and because such comments are\nreasonable. The Board finds that a significant portion of the\npublic associate the confederate flag with organizations advocating\nexpressions of hate directed toward people or groups that is\ndemeaning to those people or groups.\u201dId., at 64\u201365.The Board also saw \u201ca compelling public interest\nin protecting a conspicuous mechanism for identification, such as a\nlicense plate, from degrading into a possible public safety issue.\u201dId., at 65. And it thought that the public interest required\nrejection of the plate design because the controversy surrounding\nthe plate was so great that \u201cthe design could distract or disturb\nsome drivers to the point of being unreasonably dangerous.\u201dIbid.At the same meeting, the Board approved a\nBuffalo Soldiers plate design by a 5-to-3 vote. Proceeds from fees\npaid by motorists who select that plate benefit the Buffalo Soldier\nNational Museum in Houston, which is \u201cdedicated primarily to\npreserving the legacy and honor of the African American soldier.\u201d\nBuffalo Soldier National Museum, online at\nhttp://www.buffalosoldiermuseum.com. \u201cBuffalo Soldiers\u201d is a\nnickname that was originally given to black soldiers in the Army\u2019s\n10th Cavalry Regiment, which was formed after the Civil War, and\nthe name was later used to describe other black soldiers. W. Leckie\n& S. Leckie, The Buffalo Soldiers: A Narrative of the Black\nCavalry in the West 21, 26\u201327 (2003). The original Buffalo Soldiers\nfought with distinction in the Indian Wars, but the \u201cBuf-falo\nSoldiers\u201d plate was opposed by some Native Americans. One leader\ncommented that he felt \u201c\u00a0\u2018the same way about the Buffalo\nSoldiers\u2019\u00a0\u201d as African-Americans felt about the Confederate\nflag. Scharrer, Specialty License Plates can Bring in Revenue, But\nSome Stir Up Controversy, Hous-ton Chronicle, Nov. 26, 2011, P.B2.\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018When we see the U.\u00a0S. Cavalry uniform,\u2019\u00a0\u201d he\nexplained, \u201c\u00a0\u2018we are forced to relive an American\nholocaust.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIbid.IIARelying almost entirely on one\nprecedent\u2014Pleasant Grove Cityv.Summum, 555\nU.\u00a0S. 460 \u2014the Court holds that messages that private groups\nsucceed in placing on Texas license plates are government messages.\nThe Court badly misunderstandsSummum.InSummum, a private group claimed the\nright to erect a large stone monument in a small city park.Id., at 464. The 2.5-acre park contained 15 permanent\ndisplays, 11 of which had been donated by private parties.Ibid. The central question concerned the nature of the\nmunicipal government\u2019s conduct when it accepted privately donated\nmonuments for placement in its park: Had the city created a forum\nfor private speech, or had it accepted donated monuments that\nexpressed a government message? We held that the monuments\nrepresented government speech, and we identified several important\nfactors that led to this conclusion.First, governments have long used monuments as a\nmeans of expressing a government message. As we put it, \u201c[s]ince\nancient times, kings, emperors, and other rulers have erected\nstatues of themselves to remind their subjects of their authority\nand power.\u201dId., at 470. Here in the United States,\nimportant public monuments like the Statue of Liberty, the\nWashington Monument, and the Lincoln Memorial, express principles\nthat inspire and bind the Nation together. Thus, long experience\nhas led the public to associate public monuments with government\nspeech.Second, there is no history of landowners\nallowing their property to be used by third parties as the site of\nlarge permanent monuments that do not express messages that the\nlandowners wish to convey. Seeid., at 471. While \u201c[a] great\nmany of the monuments that adorn the Nation\u2019s public parks were\nfinanced with private funds or donated by private parties,\u201d \u201ccities\nand other jurisdictions take some care in accepting donated\nmonuments\u201d and select those that \u201cconve[y] a government message.\u201dId., at 471\u2013472. We were not presented inSummumwith\nany examples of public parks that had been thrown open for private\ngroups or individuals to put up whatever monuments they\ndesired.Third, spatial limitations played a prominent\npart in our analysis. Seeid., at 478\u2013479. \u201c[P]ublic parks\ncan accommodate only a limited number of permanent monuments,\u201d and\nconsequently permanent monuments \u201cmonopolize the use of the land on\nwhich they stand and interfere permanently with other uses of\npublic space.\u201dIbid. Because only a limited number of\nmonuments can be built in any given space, governments do not allow\ntheir parks to be cluttered with monuments that do not serve a\ngovernment purpose, a point well understood by those who visit\nparks and view the monuments they contain.These characteristics, which rendered public\nmonuments government speech inSummum, are not present in\nTexas\u2019s specialty plate program.B1I begin with history. As we said inSummum, governments have used monuments since time\nimmemorial to express important government messages, and there is\nno history of governments giving equal space to those wishing to\nexpress dissenting views. In 1775, when a large gilded equestrian\nstatue of King George III dominated Bowling Green, a small park in\nlower Manhattan,[3] the\ncolonial governor surely would not have permitted the construction\non that land of a monument to the fallen at Lexington and Concord.\nWhen the United States accepted the Third French Republic\u2019s gift of\nthe Statue of Liberty in 1877, seeid., at 477, Congress, it\nseems safe to say, would not have welcomed a gift of a Statue of\nAuthoritarianism if one had been offered by another country. Nor is\nit likely that the National Park Service today would be receptive\nif private groups, pointing to the Lincoln Memorial, the Martin\nLuther King, Jr., Memorial, and the Vietnam Veterans Memorial on\nthe National Mall, sought permission to put up monuments to\nJefferson Davis, Orval Faubus, or the North Vietnamese Army.\nGovernments have always used public monuments to express a\ngovernment message, and members of the public understand this.The history of messages on license plates is\nquite different. After the beginning of motor vehicle registration\nin 1917, more than 70 years passed before the proliferation of\nspecialty plates in Texas. It was not until the 1990\u2019s that\nmotorists were allowed to choose from among 10 messages, such as\n\u201cRead to Succeed\u201d and \u201cKeep Texas Beautiful.\u201d History at 101.Up to this point, the words on the Texas plates\ncan be considered government speech. The messages were created by\nthe State, and they plausibly promoted state programs.[4] But when, at some point within the\nlast 20 years or so, the State began to allow private entities to\nsecure plates conveying their own messages, Texas crossed the\nline.The contrast between the history of public\nmonuments, which have been used to convey government messages for\ncenturies, and the Texas license plate program could not be\nstarker.In an attempt to gather historical support for\nits position, the Court relies on plates with the mottos or symbols\nof other States. As the Court notes, some of these were issued well\nbefore \u201cThe Lone Star State\u201d made its debut in Texas in 1991.Id., at 82. But this history is irrelevant for present\npurposes. Like the 1991 Texas plate, these out-of-state plates were\ncreated by the States that issued them, and motorists generally had\nno choice but to accept them. For example, the State of New\nHampshire made it a crime to cover up the words \u201cLive Free or Die\u201d\non its plates. SeeWooleyv.Maynard, 430 U. S. 705\n(1977) .The words and symbols on plates of this sort\nwere and are government speech, but plates that are essentially\ncommissioned by private entities (at a cost that exceeds $8,000)\nand that express a message chosen by those entities are very\ndifferent\u2014and quite new. Unlike inSummum, history here does\nnot suggest that the messages at issue are government speech.2The Texas specialty plate program also does\nnot exhibit the \u201cselective receptivity\u201d present inSummum.\nTo the contrary, Texas\u2019s program isnotselective by design.\nThe Board\u2019s chairman, who is charged with approving designs,\nexplained that the program\u2019s purpose is \u201cto encourage private\nplates\u201d in order to \u201cgenerate additional revenue for the state.\u201dIbid., 58. And most of the time, the Board \u201cbase[s] [its]\ndecisions on rules that primarily deal with reflectivity and\nreadability.\u201dIbid. A Department brochure explains: \u201cQ. Who\nprovides the plate design? A. You do, though your design is subject\nto reflectivity, legibility, and design standards.\u201dId.,at\n67.b.Pressed to come up with any evidence that the\nState has exercised \u201cselective receptivity,\u201d Texas (and the Court)\nrely primarily on sketchy information not contained in the record,\nspecifically that the Board\u2019s predecessor (might have) rejected a\n\u201cpro-life\u201d plate and perhaps others on the ground that they\ncontained messages that were offensive. Seeante, at 11\n(citing Reply Brief 10 and Tr. of Oral Arg. 49\u201351). But even if\nthis happened, it shows only that the present case may not be the\nonly one in which the State has exercised viewpoint\ndiscrimination.Texas\u2019s only other (also extrarecord) evidence\nof selectivity concerns a proposed plate that was thought to create\na threat to the fair enforcement of the State\u2019s motorvehicle laws.\nReply Brief 9\u201310 (citing publicly avail-able Transcript of Texas\nDepartment of Motor Vehicles Board Meeting, Aug. 9, 2012, p. 112,\nonline at\nhttp://www.\u00a0txdmv.\u00a0gov\u00a0/\u00a0reports\u00a0-\u00a0and\u00a0-\u00a0data\u00a0/\u00a0doc\u00a0_\u00a0download\u00a0/\u00a0450\u00a0\u2013\u00a02012\u00a0\u2013tran-aug9).\nThis proposed plate was a Texas DPS Troopers Foundation (Troopers)\nplate, proposed in 2012. The Board considered that proposed plate\nat an August 2012 meeting, at which it approved six other plate\ndesigns without discussion, but it rejected the Troopers plate in a\ndeadlocked vote due to apparent concern that the plate could give\nthe impression that those displaying it would receive favored\ntreatment from state troopers.Id., at 109\u2013112. The\nconstitutionality of this Board action does not necessarily turn on\nwhether approval of this plate would have made the message\ngovernment speech. If, as I believe, the Texas specialty plate\nprogram created a limited public forum, private speech may be\nexcluded if it is inconsistent with the purpose of the forum.Rosenberger,515 U.\u00a0S., at 829.Thus, even if Texas\u2019s extrarecord information is\ntaken into account, the picture here is different from that inSummum. Texas does not take care to approve only those\nproposed plates that convey messages that the State supports.\nInstead, it proclaims that it is open to all private\nmessages\u2014except those, like the SCV plate, that would offend some\nwho viewed them.The Court believes that messages on privately\ncreated plates are government speech because motorists want a seal\nof state approval for their messages and therefore prefer plates\nover bumper stickers.Ante, at 10\u201311. This is dangerous\nreasoning. There is a big difference between government speech\n(that is, speech by the government in furtherance of its programs)\nand governmental blessing (or condemnation) of private speech. Many\nprivate speakers in a forum would welcome a sign of government\napproval. But in the realm of private speech, government regulation\nmay not favor one viewpoint over another.Rosenberger,\nsupra, at 828.3A final factor that was important inSummumwas space. A park can accommodate only so many\npermanent monuments. Often large and made of stone, monuments can\nlast for centuries and are difficult to move. License plates, on\nthe other hand, are small, light, mobile, and designed to last for\nonly a relatively brief time. The only absolute limit on the number\nof specialty plates that a State could issue is the number of\nregistered vehicles. The variety of available plates is limitless,\ntoo. Today Texas offers more than 350 varieties. In 10 years, might\nit be 3,500?In sum, the Texas specialty plate program has\nnoneof the factors that were critical inSummum, and the\nTexas program exhibits a very important characteristic that was\nmissing in that case: Individuals who want to display a Texas\nspecialty plate, instead of the standardplate, must pay an\nincreased annual registration fee.See\nhttp://www.dmv.org/tx-texas/license-plates.php. How many groups or\nindividuals would clamor to pay $8,000 (the cost of the deposit\nrequired to create a new plate) in order to broadcast the\ngovernment\u2019s message as opposed to their own? And if Texas really\nwants to speak out in support of, say, Iowa State University (but\nnot the University of Iowa) or \u201cYoung Lawyers\u201d (but not old ones),\nwhy must it be paid to say things that it really wants to say? The\nfees Texas collects pay for much more than merely the\nadministration of the program.States have not adopted specialty license plate\nprograms like Texas\u2019s because they are now bursting with things\nthey want to say on their license plates. Those programs were\nadopted because they bring in money. Texas makes public the revenue\ntotals generated by its specialtyplate program, and it is apparent\nthat the programbrings in many millions of dollars every year.\nSeehttp://www.\u00a0txdmv.\u00a0gov\u00a0/\u00a0reports\u00a0-\u00a0and\u00a0-\u00a0data\u00a0/\u00a0doc\u00a0_\u00a0download\u00a0/\u00a05050\u00a0\u2013specialty-plates-revenue-fy-1994-2014.Texas has space available on millions of little\nmobile billboards. And Texas, in effect, sells that space to those\nwho wish to use it to express a personal message\u2014provided only that\nthe message does not express a viewpoint that the State finds\nunacceptable. That is not government speech; it is the regulation\nof private speech.IIIWhat Texas has done by selling space on its\nlicense plates is to create what we have called a limited public\nforum. It has allowed state property (i.e.,motor vehicle\nlicense plates) to be used by private speakers according to rules\nthat the State prescribes. Cf.Good News Clubv.Milford\nCentral School, 533 U.\u00a0S. 98 \u2013107 (2001). Under the First\nAmendment, however, those rules cannot discriminate on the basis of\nviewpoint. SeeRosenberger, 515 U.\u00a0S., at 829 (quotingCorneliusv.NAACP Legal Defense & Ed. Fund,\nInc., 473 U.\u00a0S. 788, 806 (1985) ). But that is exactly\nwhat Texas did here. The Board rejected Texas SCV\u2019s design,\n\u201cspecifically the confederate flag portion of the design, because\npublic comments have shown that many members of the general public\nfind the design offensive, and because such comments are\nreason-able.\u201d App. 64. These statements indisputably demonstrate\nthat the Board denied Texas SCV\u2019s design because of its\nviewpoint.The Confederate battle flag is a controversial\nsymbol. To the Texas Sons of Confederate Veterans, it is said to\nevoke the memory of their ancestors and other soldiers who fought\nfor the South in the Civil War. Seeid.,at 15\u201316. To\nothers, it symbolizes slavery, segregation, and hatred. Whatever it\nmeans to motorists who display that symbol and to those who see it,\nthe flag expresses a viewpoint. The Board rejected the plate design\nbecause it concluded that many Texans would find the flag symbol\noffensive. That was pure viewpoint discrimination.If the Board\u2019s candid explanation of its reason\nfor rejecting the SCV plate were not alone sufficient to establish\nthis point, the Board\u2019s approval of the Buffalo Soldiers plate at\nthe same meeting dispels any doubt. The proponents of both the SCV\nand Buffalo Soldiers plates saw them as honoring soldiers who\nserved with bravery and honor in the past. To the opponents of both\nplates, the images on the plates evoked painful memories. The Board\nrejected one plate and approved the other.Like these two plates, many other specialty\nplates have the potential to irritate and perhaps even infuriate\nthose who see them. Texas allows a plate with the words \u201cChoose\nLife,\u201d but the State of New York rejected such a plate because the\nmessage \u201c\u00a0\u2018[is] so incredibly divisive,\u2019\u00a0\u201d and the Second\nCircuit recently sustained that decision.Children First\nFoundation, Inc.v.Fiala, ___ F.\u00a03d ___, ___, 2015\nWL 2444501, *18 (CA2, May 22, 2015). Texas allows a specialty plate\nhonoring the Boy Scouts, but the group\u2019s refusal to accept gay\nleaders angers some. Virginia, another State with a proliferation\nof specialty plates, issues plates for controversial organizations\nlike the National Rifle Association, controversial commercial\nenterprises (raising tobacco and mining coal), controversial sports\n(fox hunting), and a professional sports team with a controversial\nname (the Washington Redskins). Allowing States to reject specialty\nplates based on their potential to offend is viewpoint\ndiscrimination.The Board\u2019s decision cannot be saved by its\nsuggestion that the plate, if allowed, \u201ccould distract or disturb\nsome drivers to the point of being unreasonably dangerous.\u201d App.\n65. This rationale cannot withstand strict scrutiny. Other States\nallow specialty plates with the Confederate Battle Flag,[5] and Texas has not pointed to\nevidence that these plates have led to incidents of road rage or\naccidents. Texas does not ban bumper stickers bearing the image of\nthe Confederate battle flag. Nor does it ban any of the many other\nbumper stickers that convey political messages and other messages\nthat are capable of exciting the ireof those who loathe the ideas\nthey express. Cf.Good News Club,supra, at\n111\u2013112.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*Messages that are proposed by private parties\nand placed on Texas specialty plates are private speech, not\ngovernment speech. Texas cannot forbid private speech based on its\nviewpoint. That is what it did here. Because the Court approves\nthis violation of the First Amendment, I respectfully dissent.APPENDIXSample Texas Specialty PlatesAll found at\nhttp://txdmv.gov/motorists/license-plates/specialty-license-platesNotes1Elliot, Shifting Gears,\nForbes Life, Oct. 2013, pp. 55, 57.2The Appendix,infra, reproduces the available specialty plates mentioned\nthroughout this opinion in order of first reference.
