C.,\net\u00a0al., PETITIONERS18\u20131323v.STEPHEN RUSSO, INTERIM SECRETARY,\nLOUISIANA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HOSPITALSSTEPHEN RUSSO, INTERIM SECRETARY,\nLOUISIANA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HOSPITALS, PETITIONER18\u20131460v.JUNE MEDICAL SERVICES L. L. C.,\net\u00a0al.on writs of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the fifth circuit[June 29, 2020]Justice Thomas, dissenting.Today a majority of the Court perpetuates its\nill-founded abortion jurisprudence by enjoining a perfectly\nlegitimate state law and doing so without jurisdiction. As is often\nthe case with legal challenges to abortion regulations, this suit\nwas brought by abortionists and abortion clinics. Their sole claim\nbefore this Court is that Louisiana\u2019s law violates the purported\nsubstantive due process right of a woman to abort her unborn child.\nBut they concede that this right does not belong to them, and they\nseek to vindicate no private rights of their own. Under a proper\nunderstanding of Article III, these plaintiffs lack standing to\ninvoke our jurisdiction.Despite the fact that we granted Louisiana\u2019s\npetition specifically to address whether \u201cabortion providers [can]\nbe presumed to have third-party standing to challenge health and\nsafety regulations on behalf of their patients,\u201d Conditional\nCross-Pet. in No. 18\u20131460, p. i, a majority of the Court all but\nignores the question. The plurality and The Chief Justice\nultimately cast aside this jurisdictional barrier to conclude that\nLouisiana\u2019s law is unconstitutional under our precedents. But those\ndecisions created the right to abortion out of whole cloth, without\na shred of support from the Constitution\u2019s text. Our abortion\nprecedents are grievously wrong and should be overruled. Because we\nhave neither jurisdiction nor constitutional authority to declare\nLouisiana\u2019s duly enacted law unconstitutional, I respectfully\ndissent.IFor most of its history, this Court maintained\nthat private parties could not bring suit to vindicate the\nconstitutional rights of individuals who are not before the Court.Kowalskiv.Tesmer,543 U.S.\n125, 135 (2004) (Thomas, J., concurring) (citingClarkv.Kansas City,176 U.S.\n114, 118 (1900)). But in the 20th century, the Court began to\ndeviate from this traditional rule against third-party standing.\nSeeTruaxv.Raich,239 U.S.\n33, 38\u201339 (1915);Piercev.Society of Sisters,268 U.S.\n510, 535\u2013536 (1925). From these deviations emerged our\nprudential third-party standing doctrine, which allows litigants to\nvicariously assert the constitutional rights of others when \u201cthe\nparty asserting the right has a \u2018close\u2019 relationship with the\nperson who possesses the right\u201d and \u201cthere is a \u2018hindrance\u2019 to the\npossessor\u2019s ability to protect his own interests.\u201dKowalski,supra,at 130 (quotingPowersv.Ohio,499 U.S.\n400, 411 (1991)).[1]The plurality feints toward this doctrine,\nclaiming that third-party standing for abortionists is well settled\nby our precedents. But, ultimately, it dodges the question,\nclaiming that Louisiana\u2019s standing challenge was waived below. Both\nassertions are erroneous. First, there is no controlling precedent\nthat sets forth the blanket rule advocated for by plaintiffs\nhere\u2014i.e., abortionists may challenge health and safety\nregulations based solely on their role in the abortion process.\nSecond, I agree with Justice Alito that Louisiana did not waive its\nstanding challenge below.Post, at 24\u201325 (dissenting\nopinion).But even if there were a waiver, it would not be\nrelevant. Louisiana argues that the abortionists and abortion\nclinics lack standing under Article III to assert the putative\nrights of their potential clients. No waiver, however explicit,\ncould relieve us of our independent obligation to ensure that we\nhave jurisdiction before addressing the merits of a case. SeeDaimlerChrysler Corp.v.Cuno,547 U.S.\n332, 341 (2006). And under a proper understanding of Article\nIII\u2019s case-or-controversy requirement, plaintiffs lack standing to\ninvoke our jurisdiction because they assert no private rights of\ntheir own, seeking only to vindicate the putative constitutional\nrights of individuals not before the Court.AThe Court has previously asserted that the\ntraditional rule against third-party standing is \u201cnot\nconstitutionally mandated, but rather stem[s] from a salutary \u2018rule\nof self-restraint\u2019\u00a0\u201d motivated by \u201cprudential\u201d concerns.Craigv.Boren,429 U.S.\n190, 193 (1976) (quotingBarrowsv.Jackson,346 U.S.\n249, 255 (1953)). The plurality repeats this well-rehearsed\nclaim, accepting its validity without question. Seeante, at\n12. But support for this assertion is shallow, to say the least,\nand it is inconsistent with our more recent standing\nprecedents.As an initial matter, this Court has never\nprovided a coherent explanation for why the rule against\nthird-party standing is properly characterized as prudential. Many\ncases reciting this claim rely on the Court\u2019s decision inBarrows, which stated that the rule against third-party\nstanding is a \u201crule of self-restraint\u201d \u201c[a]part from the\njurisdictional requirement\u201d of Article III, 346 U.\u00a0S., at 255.\nButBarrowsprovides no reasoning to support that\ndistinction and even admits that the rule against third-party\nstanding is \u201cnot always clearly distinguished from the\nconstitutional limitation[s]\u201d on standing.Ibid. The sole\nauthorityBarrowscites in support of the rule\u2019s\n\u201cprudential\u201d label is a single-Justice concurrence inAshwanderv.TVA,297 U.S.\n288, 346\u2013348 (1936) (opinion of Brandeis, J.).Justice Brandeis\u2019 concurrence, however, raises\nmore questions than it answers. The opinion does not directly\nreference third-party standing. It only obliquely refers to the\nconcept by invoking the broader requirement that a plaintiff must\n\u201cshow that he is injured by [the law\u2019s] operation.\u201dId., at\n347. Justice Brandeis claims that this requirement was adopted by\nthe Court \u201cfor its own governance in cases confessedly within its\njurisdiction.\u201dId., at 346.But most of the cases he\ncites frame the matter in terms of the Court\u2019s jurisdiction and\nauthority; none of them invoke prudential justifications. See,e.g., Tylerv.Judges of Court of Registration,179 U.S.\n405, 407\u2013410 (1900);Hendrickv.Maryland,235 U.S.\n610, 621 (1915);Massachusettsv.Mellon,262 U.S.\n447, 480 (1923). Thus, the \u201cprudential\u201d label for the rule\nagainst third-party standing remains a bit of a mystery.It is especially puzzling that a majority of the\nCourt insists on continuing to treat the rule against third-party\nstanding as prudential when our recent decision inLexmark\nInt\u2019l, Inc.v.Static Control Components, Inc.,572 U.S.\n118(2014), questioned the validity of our prudential standing\ndoctrine more generally. In that case, we acknowledged that\nrequiring a litigant who has Article III standing to also\ndemonstrate \u201cprudential standing\u201d is inconsistent \u201cwith our recent\nreaffirmation of the principle that \u2018a federal court\u2019s \u201cobligation\u201d\nto hear and decide\u2019 cases within its jurisdiction \u2018is \u201cvirtually\nunflagging.\u201d\u00a0\u2019\u00a0\u201dId., at 125\u2013126 (quotingSprint Communications, Inc.v.Jacobs,571 U.S.\n69, 77 (2013)). The Court therefore suggested that the\n\u201cprudential\u201d label for these doctrines was \u201cinapt.\u201dLexmark,\n572 U.\u00a0S., at 127, n.\u00a03. As an example, it noted that the\nCourt previously considered the rule against generalized grievances\nto be \u201cprudential\u201d but now recognizes that rule to be a part of\nArticle III\u2019s case-or-controversy requirement.Ibid.The\nCourt specifically questioned the prudential label for the rule\nagainst third-party standing, but becauseLexmarkdid not\ninvolve any questions of third-party standing, the Court stated\nthat \u201cconsideration of that doctrine\u2019s proper place in the standing\nfirmament [could] await another day.\u201dId., at 128,\nn.\u00a03.The Court\u2019s previous statements on the rule\nagainst third-party standing have long suggested that the \u201cproper\nplace\u201d for that rule is in Article III\u2019s case-or-controversy\nrequirement. The Court has acknowledged that the traditional rule\nagainst third-party standing is \u201cclosely related to Art[icle] III\nconcerns.\u201dWarthv.Seldin,422\nU.S. 490, 500 (1975). It has repeatedly noted that the rule \u201cis\nnot completely separable from Art[icle] III\u2019s requirement that a\nplaintiff have a sufficiently concrete interest in the outcome of\n[the] suit to make it a case or controversy.\u201dSecretary of State\nof Md.v.Joseph H. Munson Co.,467\nU.S. 947, 955, n.\u00a05 (1984) (internal quotation marks\nomitted); see alsoBarrows,supra,at 255 (the rule\nagainst third-party standing is \u201cnot always clearly distinguished\nfrom the constitutional limitation[s]\u201d on standing). Moreover, the\nCourt has even expressly stated that the rule against third-party\nstanding is \u201cgrounded in Art[icle] III limits on the jurisdiction\nof federal courts to actual cases and controversies.\u201dNew\nYorkv.Ferber,458 U.S.\n747, 767, n.\u00a020 (1982).And most recently, inSpokeo, Inc.v.Robins, 578 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2016), the Court appeared to\nincorporate the rule against third-party standing into its\nunderstanding of Article III\u2019s injury-in-fact requirement. There,\nthe Court stated that to establish an injury-in-fact a plaintiff\nmust \u201cshow that he or she suffered \u2018an invasion of a legally\nprotected interest\u2019 that is \u2018concrete and particularized\u2019 and\n\u2018actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId.,at ___ (slip op., at 7) (quotingLujanv.Defenders of Wildlife,504 U.S.\n555, 560 (1992)). The Court further explained that whether a\nplaintiff \u201calleges that [the defendant] violatedhisstatutory rights\u00a0\u201d rather than \u201cthe statutory rights of other\npeople\u00a0\u201d was a question of \u201cparticularization\u201d for an Article\nIII injury. 578 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 8) (internal\nquotation marks omitted). It is hard to reconcile this language inSpokeowith the plurality\u2019s assertion that third-party\nstanding is permitted under Article III.BA brief historical examination of Article\nIII\u2019s case-or-controversy requirement confirms what our recent\ndecisions suggest: The rule against third-party standing is\nconstitutional, not prudential. The judicial power is limited to\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018\u00a0\u201ccases and controversies of the sort traditionally\namenable to, and resolved by, the judicial process.\u201d\u00a0\u2019\u00a0\u201dId., at ___ (Thomas, J., concurring) (slip op., at 1)\n(quotingVermont Agency of Natural Resourcesv.United\nStates ex rel. Stevens,529 U.S.\n765, 774 (2000)); see alsoMuskratv.United\nStates,219 U.S.\n346, 356\u2013357 (1911). Thus, to ascertain the scope of Article\nIII\u2019s case-or-controversy requirement, \u201cwe must \u2018refer directly to\nthe traditional, fundamental limitations upon the powers of\ncommon-law courts.\u2019\u00a0\u201dSpokeo,supra,at ___\n(Thomas, J., concurring) (slip op., at 2) (quotingHonigv.Doe,484 U.S.\n305, 340 (1988) (Scalia, J., dissenting)). \u201cOne focus\u201d of these\ntraditional limitations was \u201con the particular parties before the\ncourt, and whether the rights that they [were] invoking [were]\nreally theirs to control.\u201d Woolhandler & Nelson, Does History\nDefeat Standing Doctrine? 102 Mich. L.\u00a0Rev. 689, 732 (2004).\nAn examination of these limitations reveals that a plaintiff could\nnot establish a case or controversy by asserting the constitutional\nrights of others.The limitations imposed on suits at common law\nvaried based on the type of right the plaintiff sought to\nvindicate.Spokeo, 578 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (Thomas, J.,\nconcurring) (slip op., at 2). The rights adjudicated by common-law\ncourts generally fell into one of two categories: public or\nprivate. Public rights are those \u201cowed \u2018to the whole community\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. in its social aggregate capacity.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId., at ___ (slip op., at 3) (quoting 4 W. Blackstone,\nCommentaries *5). Private rights, on the other hand, are those\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018belonging to individuals, considered as\nindividuals.\u2019\u00a0\u201dSpokeo,supra, at ___ (Thomas,\nJ., concurring) (slip op., at 2) (quoting 3 Blackstone,\nCommentaries *2).When a plaintiff sought to vindicate a private\nright, \u201ccourts historically presumed that the plaintiff suffered ade\u00a0factoinjury merely from having his personal, legal\nrights invaded.\u201dSpokeo,supra,at ___ (Thomas, J.,\nconcurring) (slip op., at 2). But a plaintiff generally \u201cneed[ed]\nto have a private interest of his or her own to litigate;\notherwise, no sufficient interest [was] at stake on the plaintiff\u2019s\nside, and the clash of interests necessary for a \u2018Case\u2019 or\n\u2018Controversy\u2019 [did] not exist.\u201d Woolhandler & Nelson,supra, at 723. Thus, 19th-century judges uniformly refused\nto \u201clisten to an objection made to the constitutionality of an act\nby a party whose rights\u201d were not at issue.Clark, 176\nU.\u00a0S., at 118 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also,e.g.,Tyler, 179 U.\u00a0S., at 406\u2013407;Supervisorsv.Stanley,105 U.S.\n305, 311 (1882);United Statesv.Ferreira, 13\nHow. 40, 51\u201352 (1852);Owingsv.Norwood\u2019s Lessee, 5\nCranch 344, 348 (1809) (Marshall, C.\u00a0J.);In re\nWellington, 33 Mass. 87, 96 (1834) (Shaw, C.\u00a0J.).[2]Moreover, it was not enough for a plaintiff to\nallegedamnum\u2014i.e., real-world damages or practical\ninjury\u2014if the law he was challenging did not violate a legally\nprotected interest of his own. At common law, this sort of \u201cfactual\nharm without a legal injury wasdamnum absque injuriaand\nprovided no basis for relief.\u201d Hessick, Standing, Injury in Fact,\nand Private Rights, 93 Cornell L.\u00a0Rev. 275, 280\u2013281 (2008). As\nJustice Dodderidge explained in 1625, \u201cinjuria & damnum are the\ntwo grounds for the having [of] all actions, and without [both of]\nthese, no action lieth.\u201dCablev.Rogers, 3 Bulst.\n311, 312, 81 Eng. Rep. 259. In the 18th century, many common-law\ncourts ceased requiringdamnumin suits alleging violations\nof private rights. See,e.g., Ashbyv.White, 2 Raym.\nLd. 938, 92 Eng. Rep. 126, 137 (K.\u00a0B.) (Holt, C.\u00a0J.),\naff\u2019d, 3 Raym. Ld. 320, 92 Eng. Rep. 710, 712\n(H.\u00a0L.\u00a01703); see alsoWebbv.Portland Mfg.\nCo., 29 F. Cas. 506, 507 (No.\u00a017,322) (CC Me. 1838)\n(Story, J.). But they continued to require legal injury, adhering\nto the \u201cobvious\u201d and \u201cancient maxim\u201d that one\u2019s real-world damages\nalone cannot \u201clay the foundation of an action.\u201dParkerv.Griswold, 17 Conn. 288, 302\u2013303 (1846). Thus, a plaintiff\nhad to assert \u201c[a]n injury, [which,] legally speaking, consists of\na wrong done to a person, or, in other words, a violation of his\nright.\u201dId., at 302.This brief historical review demonstrates that\nthird-party standing is inconsistent with the case-or-controversy\nrequirement of Article III. When a private plaintiff seeks to\nvindicate someone else\u2019s legal injury, he has no private right of\nhis own genuinely at stake in the litigation. Even if the plaintiff\nhas suffered damages as a result of another\u2019s legal injury, he has\nno standing to challenge a law that does not violate his own\nprivate rights.CApplying these principles to the case at hand,\nplaintiffs lack standing under Article III and we, in turn, lack\njurisdiction to decide these cases. Thus, \u201c[i]n light of th[e]\n\u2018overriding and time-honored concern about keeping the Judiciary\u2019s\npower within its proper constitutional sphere, we must put aside\nthe natural urge to proceed directly to the merits of [an]\nimportant dispute and to \u201csettle\u201d it for the sake of convenience\nand efficiency.\u2019\u00a0\u201dHollingsworthv.Perry,570 U.S.\n693, 704\u2013705 (2013) (Roberts, C.\u00a0J., for the Court)\n(quotingRainesv.Byrd,521\nU.S. 811, 820 (1997)).1Contrary to the plurality\u2019s assertion\notherwise,ante, at 16, abortionists\u2019 standing to assert the\nputative rights of their clients has not been settled by our\nprecedents. It is true that this Court has reflexively allowed\nabortionists and abortion clinics to vicariously assert a woman\u2019s\nputative right to abortion. But oftentimes the Court has not so\nmuch as addressed standing in those cases. See,e.g., Whole\nWoman\u2019s Healthv.Hellerstedt, 579 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___\n(2016);Gonzalesv.Carhart,550\nU.S. 124(2007);Ayottev.Planned Parenthood of\nNorthern New Eng.,546 U.S.\n320(2006);Stenbergv.Carhart,530 U.S.\n914(2000);Mazurekv.Armstrong,520 U.S.\n968(1997) (per curiam);Planned Parenthood of\nSoutheastern Pa.v.Casey,505 U.S.\n833(1992). And questions \u201cmerely lurk[ing] in the record,\nneither brought to the attention of the court nor ruled upon,\u201d are\nnot \u201cconsidered as having been so decided as to constitute\nprecedents.\u201dWebsterv.Fall,266\nU.S. 507,511(1925); see alsoIllinois Bd. of Electionsv.Socialist\nWorkers Party,440 U.S.\n173, 183 (1979). Specifically, when it comes \u201cto our own\njudicial power or jurisdiction, this Court has followed the lead of\nChief Justice Marshall who held that this Court is not bound by a\nprior exercise of jurisdiction in a case where it was not\nquestioned and it was passedsub silentio.\u201dUnited\nStatesv.L. A. Tucker Truck Lines, Inc.,344 U.S.\n33, 38 (1952) (citingUnited Statesv.More, 3\nCranch 159 (1805) (Marshall, C.\u00a0J., for the Court)).The first\u2014and only\u2014time the Court squarely\naddressed this question with a reasoned decision was inSingletonv.Wulff,428 U.S.\n106(1976).[3] In that\ncase, a fractured Court concluded that two abortionists had\nstanding to challenge a State\u2019s refusal to provide Medicaid\nreimbursements for abortions. Perfunctorily applying this Court\u2019s\nrequirements for third-party standing, Justice Blackmun, joined by\nthree other Justices, asserted that abortionists generally had\nstanding to litigate their clients\u2019 rights.Id., at 113\u2013118\n(plurality opinion). Justice Stevens concurred on considerably\nnarrower grounds, reasoning that the abortionists had standing\nbecause they had a financial stake in the outcome of the litigation\nand sought to vindicate their own constitutional rights as well.Id.,at 121 (opinion concurring in part). Notably, Justice\nStevens declined to join the plurality\u2019s discussion of third-party\nstanding, explaining that he was \u201cnot sure whether [that analysis]\nwould, or should, sustain the doctors\u2019 standing, apart from\u201d their\nown legal rights and financial interests being at stake in that\nspecific case.Id.,at 122. The four remaining Justices\ndissented in part, concluding that the abortionists lacked standing\nto litigate the rights of their clients.Id.,at 122\u2013131\n(Powell, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Because\nJustice Stevens\u2019 opinion \u201cconcurred in the judgmen[t] on the\nnarrowest grounds,\u201d it is the controlling opinion regarding\nabortionists\u2019 third-party standing.Marksv.United\nStates,430\nU.S. 188, 193 (1977).[4]To the extent Justice Stevens\u2019 opinion could be\nread as concluding that abortionists have standing to vicariously\nassert their clients\u2019 rights so long as the abortionists establish\nstanding on their own legal claims, his position has been abrogated\nby this Court\u2019s more recent decisions, which have \u201cconfirm[ed] that\na plaintiff must demonstrate standing for each claim he seeks to\npress.\u201dDaimlerChrysler Corp., 547 U.\u00a0S., at 352. But\nmore importantly, Justice Stevens\u2019 opinion does not support the\nabortionists in these cases, because his opinion rested on\ncase-specific facts not implicated here\u2014namely, the fact that the\nabortionists would directly receive Medicaid payments from the\ndefendant agency if they prevailed and that they asserted\nviolations oftheir ownconstitutional rights. In these\ncases, there is no dispute that the abortionists\u2019 sole claim before\nthis Court is that Louisiana\u2019s law violates the purported\nsubstantive due process rightsof their clients.2Under a proper understanding of Article III,\nplaintiffs lack standing. As explained above, in suits seeking to\nvindicate private rights, the owners of those rights can establish\na sufficient injury simply by asserting that their rights have been\nviolated. Constitutional rights are generally considered \u201cprivate\nrights\u201d to the extent they \u201c\u00a0\u2018\u00a0belon[g] to individuals,\nconsidered as individuals.\u2019\u00a0\u201dSpokeo, 578\nU.\u00a0S.,at ___ (Thomas, J., concurring) (slip op., at 3)\n(quoting 3 Blackstone, Commentaries *2); see alsoUnited\nStatesv.Sineneng-Smith, 590 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2020)\n(Thomas, J., concurring) (slip op., at 8). And the purported\nsubstantive due process right to abort an unborn child is no\nexception\u2014it is an individual right that is inherently personal.\nAfter all, the Court \u201ccreat[ed the] right\u201d based on the notion that\nabortion \u201c\u00a0\u2018\u00a0involv[es] the most intimate and personal\nchoices a person may make in a lifetime, choices central to\npersonal dignity and autonomy.\u2019\u00a0\u201dWhole Women\u2019s Health,\n579 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (Thomas, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 5)\n(quotingCasey, 505 U.\u00a0S., at 851 (majority opinion)).\nBecause this right belongs to the woman making that choice, not to\nthose who provide abortions, plaintiffs cannot establish a personal\nlegal injury by asserting that this right has been\nviolated.[5]The only injury asserted by plaintiffs in this\nsuit is the possibility of facing criminal sanctions if the\nabortionists conduct abortions without admitting privileges in\nviolation of the law. See Response and Reply for Petitioners (No.\n18\u20131460)/Cross-Respondents (No. 18\u20131323), p. 34. But plaintiffs do\nnot claim any right to provide abortions, nor do they contest that\nthe State has authority to regulate such procedures.[6] They have therefore demonstrated only\nreal-world damages (or more accurately, thepossibilityof\nreal-world damages), but no legal injury, or \u201cinvasion of a legally\nprotected interest,\u201d that belongs to them.Spokeo,supra,at ___ (slip op., at 7) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Thus, under a proper understanding of Article III,\nplaintiffs lack standing and, consequently, this Court lacks\njurisdiction.IIEven if the plaintiffs had standing, the Court\nwould still lack the authority to enjoin Louisiana\u2019s law, which\nrepresents a constitutionally valid exercise of the State\u2019s\ntraditional police powers. The plurality and The Chief Justice\nclaim that the Court\u2019s judgment is dictated by \u201cour precedents,\u201d\nparticularlyWhole Woman\u2019s Health.Ante, at 38\n(plurality opinion); see alsoante,at 2, 11\u201316 (Roberts,\nC.\u00a0J., concurring in judgment). For the detailed reasons\nexplained by Justice Alito, this is not true.Post, at 3\u201323\n(dissenting opinion).But today\u2019s decision is wrong for a far simpler\nreason: The Constitution does not constrain the States\u2019 ability to\nregulate or even prohibit abortion. This Court created the right to\nabortion based on an amorphous, unwritten right to privacy, which\nit grounded in the \u201clegal fiction\u201d of substantive due process,McDonaldv.Chicago,561 U.S.\n742, 811 (2010) (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring\nin judgment). As the origins of this jurisprudence readily\ndemonstrate, the putative right to abortion is a creation that\nshould be undone.AThe Court first conceived a free-floating\nconstitutional right to privacy inGriswoldv.Connecticut,381 U.S.\n479(1965). In that case, the Court declared unconstitutional a\nstate law prohibiting the use of contraceptives, finding that it\nviolated a married couple\u2019s \u201cright of privacy.\u201dId., at 486.\nThe Court explained that this right could be found in the\n\u201cpenumbras\u201d offivedifferent Amendments to the\nConstitution\u2014the First, Third, Fourth, Fifth, and Ninth.Id.,at 484. Rather than explain what free speech or the\nquartering of troops had to do with contraception, the Court simply\ndeclared that these rights had created \u201czones of privacy\u201d with\ntheir \u201cpenumbras,\u201d which were \u201cformed by emanations from those\nguarantees that help give them life and substance.\u201dIbid.\nThis reasoning is as mystifying as it is baseless.As Justice Black observed in his dissent, this\ngeneral \u201cright of privacy\u201d was never before considered a\nconstitutional guarantee protecting citizens from governmental\nintrusion.Id.,at 508\u2013510. Rather, the concept was one of\ntort law, championed by Samuel Warren and the future Justice Louis\nBrandeis in their 1890 Harvard Law Review article entitled, \u201cThe\nRight to Privacy.\u201d 4 Harv. L.\u00a0Rev. 193. Over 20 years after\nthe Fourteenth Amendment was ratified and a century after the Bill\nof Rights was adopted, Warren and Brandeis were among the first to\nadvocate for this privacy right in the context of tort relief for\nthose whose personal information and private affairs were exploited\nby others.Id.,at 193, 195\u2013196, 214\u2013220. By \u201cexalting a\nphrase .\u00a0.\u00a0. used in discussing grounds for tort relief,\nto the level of a constitutional rule,\u201d the Court arrogated to\nitself the \u201cpower to invalidate any legislative act which [it]\nfind[s] irrational, unreasonable[,] or offensive\u201d as an\nimpermissible \u201cinterfere[nce] with \u2018privacy.\u2019\u00a0\u201dGriswold,\nsupra, at 510, n.\u00a01, 511 (Black, J., dissenting).Just eight years later, the Court utilized its\nnewfound power inRoev.Wade,410 U.S.\n113(1973). There, the Court struck down a Texas law\nrestricting abortion as a violation of a woman\u2019s constitutional\n\u201cright of privacy,\u201d which it grounded in the \u201cconcept of personal\nliberty\u201d purportedly protected by the Due Process Clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment.Id., at 153. The Court began its legal\nanalysis by openly acknowledging that the Constitution\u2019s text does\nnot \u201cmention any right of privacy.\u201dId.,at 152. The Court\nnevertheless concluded that it need not bother with our founding\ndocument\u2019s text, because the Court\u2019s prior decisions\u2014chief among\nthemGriswold\u2014had already divined such a right from\nconstitutional penumbras.Roe, 410 U.\u00a0S., at 152.\nWithout any legal explanation, the Court simply concluded that this\nunwritten right to privacy was \u201cbroad enough to encompass a woman\u2019s\n[abortion] decision.\u201dId., at 153.BRoeis grievously wrong for many\nreasons, but the most fundamental is that its core holding\u2014that the\nConstitution protects a woman\u2019s right to abort her unborn\nchild\u2014finds no support in the text of the Fourteenth Amendment.Roesuggests that the Due Process Clause\u2019s reference to\n\u201cliberty\u201d could provide a textual basis for its novel privacy\nright.Ibid. But that Clause does not guarantee libertyqualiberty. Rather, it expressly contemplates thedeprivationof liberty and requires only that such\ndeprivations occur through \u201cdue process of law.\u201d Amdt. 14, \u00a71. As I\nhave previously explained, there is \u201c\u00a0\u2018considerable historical\nevidence support[ing] the position that \u201cdue process of law\u201d was\n[originally understood as] a separation-of-powers concept\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. forbidding only deprivations not authorized by\nlegislation or common law.\u2019\u00a0\u201dJohnsonv.United\nStates, 576 U.S. 591, 623 (2015) (opinion concurring in\njudgment) (quoting D. Currie, The Constitution in the Supreme\nCourt: The First Hundred Years 1789\u20131888, p. 272 (1985)). Others\nclaim that the original understanding of this Clause requires that\n\u201cstatutes that purported to empower the other branches to deprive\npersons of rights without adequate procedural guarantees [be]\nsubject to judicial review.\u201d Chapman & McConnell, Due Process\nas Separation of Powers, 121 Yale L.\u00a0J. 1672, 1679 (2012).\nBut, whatever the precise requirements of the Due Process Clause,\n\u201cthe notion that a constitutional provision that guarantees only\n\u2018process\u2019 before a person is deprived of life, liberty, or property\ncould define the substance of those rights strains credulity for\neven the most casual user of words.\u201dMcDonald, 561\nU.\u00a0S.,at 811 (opinion of Thomas, J.).More specifically, the idea that the Framers of\nthe Fourteenth Amendment understood the Due Process Clause to\nprotect a right to abortion is farcical. SeeRoe, 410\nU.\u00a0S., at 174\u2013175 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting). In 1868, when\nthe Fourteenth Amendment was ratified, a majority of the States and\nnumerous Territories had laws on the books that limited (and in\nmany cases nearly prohibited) abortion. Seeid.,at 175,\nn.\u00a01.[7] It would no doubt\nshock the public at that time to learn that one of the new\nconstitutional Amendments contained hidden within the interstices\nof its text a right to abortion. The fact that it took this Court\nover a century to find that right all but proves that it was more\nthan hidden\u2014it simply was not (and is not) there.CDespite the readily apparent illegitimacy ofRoe, \u201cthe Court has doggedly adhered to [its core holding]\nagain and again, often to disastrous ends.\u201dGamblev.United States, 587 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2019) (Thomas, J.,\nconcurring) (slip op., at 16). In doing so, the Court has\nrepeatedly invokedstare decisis. See,e.g., Casey,\n505 U.\u00a0S., at 854\u2013869. And today, a majority of the Court\ninsists that this doctrine compels its result. Seeante, at\n40 (plurality opinion);ante,at 2, 11 (opinion of Roberts,\nC.\u00a0J.).The Court\u2019s current \u201cformulation of thestare\ndecisisstandard does not comport with our judicial duty under\nArticle III,\u201d which requires us to faithfully interpret the\nConstitution.Gamble, 587 U.\u00a0S.,at ___ (Thomas,\nJ., concurring) (slip op., at 2). Rather, when our prior decisions\nclearly conflict with the text of the Constitution, we are required\nto \u201cprivilege [the] text over our own precedents.\u201dId.,at\n___ (slip op., at 10). BecauseRoeand its progeny are\npremised on a \u201cdemonstrably erroneous interpretation of the\nConstitution,\u201d we should not apply them here. 587 U.\u00a0S., at\n___ (Thomas, J., concurring) (slip op., at 10).Even under The Chief Justice\u2019s approach tostare decisis, continued adherence to these precedents\ncannot be justified.Stare decisisis \u201cnot an inexorable\ncommand,\u201dante, at 3 (internal quotation marks omitted), and\nthis Court has recently overruled a number of poorly reasoned\nprecedents that have proved themselves to be unworkable, seeKnickv.Township of Scott, 588 U.\u00a0S. ___,\n___\u2013___ (2019) (Roberts, C.\u00a0J., for the Court) (slip op., at\n20\u201323);Franchise Tax Bd. of Cal.v.Hyatt, 587\nU.\u00a0S. ___, ___\u2013___ (2019) (slip op., at 16\u201317);Janusv.State, County, and Municipal Employees, 585 U.\u00a0S.\n___, ___\u2013___ (2018) (slip op., at 33\u201347). As I have already\ndemonstrated,supra,at 14\u201317,Roe\u2019s reasoning is\nutterly deficient\u2014in fact, not a single Justice today attempts to\ndefend it.Moreover, the fact that no five Justices can\nagree on the proper interpretation of our precedents today evinces\nthat our abortion jurisprudence remains in a state of utter\nentropy. Since the Court decidedRoe, Members of this Court\nhave decried the unworkability of our abortion case law and\nrepeatedly called for course corrections of varying degrees. See,e.g.,410 U.\u00a0S., at 171\u2013178 (Rehnquist, J.,\ndissenting);Doev.Bolton,410\nU.S. 179, 221\u2013223 (1973) (White, J., dissenting);Akronv.Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc.,462 U.S.\n416, 452\u2013466 (1983) (O\u2019Connor, J., dissenting);Thornburghv.American College of Obstetricians and\nGynecologists,476 U.S.\n747, 785\u2013797 (1986) (White, J., dissenting);Websterv.Reproductive Health Services,492 U.S.\n490, 532\u2013537 (1989) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and\nconcurring in judgment);Casey, 505 U.\u00a0S., at 944\u2013966\n(Rehnquist, C. J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in\npart);id.,at 979\u20131002 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment\nin part and dissenting in part);Stenberg, 530 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 953\u2013956 (Scalia, J., dissenting);id.,at 980\u2013983\n(Thomas, J., dissenting);Whole Woman\u2019s Health, 579\nU.\u00a0S., at ___\u2013___ (Thomas, J., dissenting) (slip op., at\n5\u201311). InCasey, the majority claimed to clarify this\n\u201cjurisprudence of doubt,\u201d 505 U.\u00a0S., at 844, but our decisions\nin the decades since then have only demonstrated the folly of that\nassertion, seeStenberg, 530 U.\u00a0S., at 953\u2013956 (Scalia,\nJ., dissenting);id.,at 960\u2013979 (Kennedy, J., dissenting);Whole Woman\u2019s Health,supra, at ___\u2013___ (Thomas, J.,\ndissenting) (slip op., at 5\u201311). They serve as further evidence\nthat this Court\u2019s abortion jurisprudence has failed to deliver the\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018principled and intelligible\u2019\u00a0\u201d development of the law\nthatstare decisispurports to secure.Ante,at 3\n(opinion of Roberts, C.\u00a0J.) (quotingVasquezv.Hillery,474 U.S.\n254, 265 (1986)).The Chief Justice advocates for a Burkean\napproach to the law that favors adherence to \u201c\u00a0\u2018the general\nbank and capital of nations and of ages.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAnte, at 3\n(quoting 3 E. Burke, Reflections on the Revolution in France 110\n(1790)). But such adherence to precedent was conspicuously absent\nwhen the Court broke new ground with its decisions inGriswoldandRoe. And no one could seriously claim\nthat these revolutionary decisions\u2014orWhole Woman\u2019s Health,\ndecided just four Terms ago\u2014are part of the \u201cinheritance from\nour forefathers,\u201d fidelity to which demonstrates \u201creverence to\nantiquity.\u201d E. Burke, Reflections on the Revolution in France 27\u201328\n(J.\u00a0Pocock ed. 1987).More importantly, we exceed our constitutional\nauthority whenever we \u201cappl[y] demonstrably erroneous precedent\ninstead of the relevant law\u2019s text.\u201dGamble,supra,at ___ (Thomas, J., concurring) (slip op., at 2). Because we can\nreconcile neitherRoenor its progeny with the text of our\nConstitution, those decisions should be overruled.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*Because we lack jurisdiction and our abortion\njurisprudence finds no basis in the Constitution, I respectfully\ndissent.[8]Notes1In practice, this\ndoctrine\u2019s application has been unconvincing and unpredictable,\nwhich has long caused me to question its legitimacy. See,e.g.,\nUnited Statesv.Sineneng-Smith, 590 U.\u00a0S.\n___,___\u2013___ (2020) (Thomas, J., concurring) (slip op., at\n6\u20139);Whole Woman\u2019s Healthv.Hellerstedt, 579\nU.\u00a0S. ___, ___\u2013___ (2016) (Thomas, J., dissenting) (slip op.,\nat 2\u20135);Kowalski, 543 U.\u00a0S., at 135 (Thomas, J.,\nconcurring). For example, the Court has held that attorneys cannot\nbring suit to vindicate the Sixth Amendment rights of their\npotential clients due to the lack of a current close relationship,id.,at 130\u2013131, but the Court permits defendants to seek\nrelief based on the Fourteenth Amendment equal protection rights of\npotential jurors whom they have never met,Powers, 499\nU.\u00a0S., at 410\u2013416;J. E. B.v.Alabama ex rel. T.\nB.,511 U.S.\n127, 129 (1994). And today, the plurality reaffirms our\nprecedent allowing beer vendors to assert the Fourteenth Amendment\nrights of their potential customers.Ante,at 14 (citingCraigv.Boren,429 U.S.\n190, 192 (1976)). But it is fair to wonder whether gun vendors\ncould expect to receive the same privilege if they seek to\nvindicate the Second Amendment rights of their customers. Given\nthis Court\u2019s ad\u00a0hoc approach to third-party standing and its\ntendency to treat the Second Amendment as a second-class right,\ntheir time would be better spent waiting for Godot.2Common-law courts\u2019\nrecognition of prochain ami or \u201cnext friend\u201d standing is not\ninconsistent with this point. In those cases, the third party was\n\u201cno party to the suit in the technical sense\u201d but rather served as\n\u201can officer of the court\u201d and was legally \u201cappointed by [the court]\nto look after the interests of [the party lacking legal capacity],\u201d\nwho remained the real party in interest on \u201cwhom the judgment in\nthe action [was] consequently binding.\u201dBlumenthalv.Craig, 81 F. 320, 321\u2013322 (CA3 1897) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). In contrast, the real parties in interest\nhere\u2014women seeking abortions in Louisiana\u2014cannot be bound by a\njudgment against abortionists and abortion clinics.3Although the Court\nconcluded that the abortionists had standing to challenge the\nconstitutionality of abortion regulations inDoev.Bolton,410 U.S.\n179(1973), it did so only in dicta,id.,at 188\u2013189.\nThe abortionists\u2019 coplaintiffs were pregnant women whom the Court\ndetermined had standing to assert their own rights, and thus\nwhether the abortionists had standing was \u201ca matter of no great\nconsequence.\u201dId., at 188. Even so, the Court only cursorily\nconsidered the question whether the threat of prosecution faced by\nthe abortionists was a sufficiently direct injury under the Court\u2019s\nthen-existing standing doctrine,id.,at 188\u2013189, which was\nconsiderably more lenient than our current understanding. The Court\ndid not engage in any meaningful Article III analysis or refer to\nthis Court\u2019s third-party standing doctrine.Ibid.; see alsoAkronv.Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc.,462 U.S.\n416, 440, n.\u00a030 (1983) (concluding without any analysis\nthat an abortionist had standing to raise a claim on behalf of his\nminor patients). And notably, the abortionists in that case had\nbrought suit to vindicate their own constitutional rights to\n\u201cpractic[e] their .\u00a0.\u00a0. professio[n].\u201dDoe,supra, at 186;see alsoPlanned Parenthood of\nCentral Mo.v.Danforth,428 U.S.\n52, 62 (1976) (concluding, without any analysis of Article III\nor the third-party standing doctrine, that abortionists had\nstanding in a suit alleging violations of both their own\nconstitutional rights and those of their clients).4Three Justices of this\nCourt have recently taken the position that this rule fromMarks,430 U.S.\n188, does not necessarily apply in all 4\u20131\u20134 cases, and that\nsuch decisions can sometimes produce \u201cno controlling opinion at\nall.\u201dRamosv.Louisiana, 590 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___\n(2020) (principal opinion) (slip op., at 18). But even under their\nview, Justice Blackmun\u2019s plurality inSingletonwould not be\nconsidered binding precedent.5Notably, plaintiffs point\nto no evidence in the record of women who seek abortions in\nLouisiana actually opposing this law on the ground that it violates\ntheir constitutional rights.6Although plaintiffs\ninitially argued that Louisiana\u2019s law also violated their\nprocedural due process rights by requiring them to obtain admitting\nprivileges in an unreasonably short time, App. 24, 28, they have\nsince abandoned that claim. And even if they had asserted\nviolations of their own rights before this Court, those legal\ninjuries would be insufficient to establish standing for a distinct\nclaim based on their clients\u2019 putative rights.
