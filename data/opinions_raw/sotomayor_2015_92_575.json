PEREZ, SECRETARY OF LABOR, et\u00a0al.,\nPETITIONERS13\u20131041v.MORTGAGE BANKERS ASSOCIATION et\u00a0al.JEROME NICKOLS, et al., PETITIONERS13\u20131052v.MORTGAGE BANKERS ASSOCIATIONon writs of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for\nthe district of columbia circuit[March 9, 2015]Justice Sotomayor delivered the opinion of the Court.When a federal administrative agency first issues a rule\ninterpreting one of its regulations, it is generally not required\nto follow the notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures of the\nAdministrative Procedure Act (APA or Act). See5 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7553(b)(A). The United States Court of Appeals for the District of\nColumbia Circuit has nevertheless held, in a line of cases\nbeginning withParalyzed Veterans of Am.v.D.\u00a0C.\nArena L. P., 117 F.\u00a03d 579 (1997), that an agency must use\nthe APA\u2019s notice-and-comment procedures when it wishes to issue a\nnew interpretation of a regulation that deviates significantly from\none the agency has previously adopted. The question in these cases\nis whether the rule announced inParalyzed Veteransis\nconsistent with the APA. We hold that it is not.IAThe APA establishes the procedures federal administrative\nagencies use for \u201crule making,\u201d defined as the process of\n\u201cformulating, amending, or repealing a rule.\u201d \u00a7551(5). \u201cRule,\u201d in\nturn, is defined broadly to include \u201cstatement[s] of general or\nparticular applicability and future effect\u201d that are designed to\n\u201cimplement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy.\u201d \u00a7551(4).Section 4 of the APA,5 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7553, prescribes a\nthree-step procedure for so-called \u201cnotice-and-comment rulemaking.\u201d\nFirst, the agency must issue a \u201c[g]eneral notice of proposed rule\nmaking,\u201d ordinarily by publication in the Federal Register.\u00a7553(b). Second, if \u201cnotice [is] required,\u201d the agency must \u201cgive\ninterested persons an opportunity to participate in the rule making\nthrough submission of written data, views, or arguments.\u201d \u00a7553(c).\nAn agency must consider and respond to significant comments\nreceived during the period for public comment. SeeCitizens to\nPreserve Overton Park, Inc.v.Volpe,401 U.\u00a0S.\n402,416 (1971);Thompsonv.Clark, 741 F.\u00a02d\n401, 408 (CADC 1984). Third, when the agency promulgates the final\nrule, it must include in the rule\u2019s text \u201ca concise general\nstatement of [its] basis and purpose.\u201d \u00a7553(c). Rules issued\nthrough the notice-and-comment process are often referred to as\n\u201clegislative rules\u201d because they have the \u201cforce and effect of\nlaw.\u201dChrysler Corp.v.Brown,441 U.\u00a0S. 281\u2013303\n(1979) (internal quotation marks omitted).Not all \u201crules\u201d must be issued through the notice-and-comment\nprocess. Section 4(b)(A) of the APA provides that, unless another\nstatute states otherwise, the notice-and-comment requirement \u201cdoes\nnot apply\u201d to \u201cinterpretative rules, general statements of policy,\nor rules of agency organization, procedure, or practice.\u201d5\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7553(b)(A). The term \u201cinterpretative rule,\u201d or\n\u201cinterpretive rule,\u201d[1] is not further defined by\nthe APA, and its precise meaning is the source of much scholarly\nand judicial debate. See generally Pierce, Distinguishing\nLegislative Rules From Interpretative Rules, 52 Admin. L.\u00a0Rev.\n547 (2000); Manning, Nonlegislative Rules, 72 Geo. Wash.\nL.\u00a0Rev. 893 (2004). We need not, and do not, wade into that\ndebate here. For our purposes, it suffices to say that the critical\nfeature of interpretive rules is that they are \u201cissued by an agency\nto advise the public of the agency\u2019s construction of the statutes\nand rules which it administers.\u201dShalalav.Guernsey\nMemorial Hospital,514 U.\u00a0S. 87,99 (1995) (internal\nquotation marks omitted). The absence of a notice-and-comment\nobligation makes the process of issuing interpretive rules\ncomparatively easier for agencies than issuing legislative rules.\nBut that convenience comes at a price: Interpretive rules \u201cdo not\nhave the force and effect of law and are not accorded that weight\nin the adjudicatory process.\u201dIbid.BThese cases began as a dispute over efforts by the Department of\nLabor to determine whether mortgage-loan officers are covered by\nthe Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA),52Stat.1060, as\namended,29 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7201et\u00a0seq.The FLSA\n\u201cestablishe[s] a minimum wage and overtime compensation for each\nhour worked in excess of 40 hours in each workweek\u201d for many\nemployees.Integ-rity Staffing Solutions, Inc.v.Busk, 574 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 3).\nCertain classes of employees, however, are exempt from these\nprovisions. Among these exempt individuals are those \u201cemployed in a\nbona fide executive, administrative, or professional capacity\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. or in the capacity of outside salesman\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. .\u201d \u00a7213(a)(1). The exemption for such employees is\nknown as the \u201cadministrative\u201d exemption.The FLSA grants the Secretary of Labor authority to \u201cdefin[e]\u201d\nand \u201cdelimi[t]\u201d the categories of exempt admin-istrative employees.Ibid.The Secretary\u2019s current regu-lations regarding the\nadministrative exemption were promulgated in 2004 through a\nnotice-and-commentrulemaking. As relevant here, the 2004\nregulations differed from the previous regulations in that they\ncontained a new section providing several examples of exempt\nadministrative employees. See 29 CFR \u00a7541.203. One of the examples\nis \u201c[e]mployees in the financial services industry,\u201d who, depending\non the nature of their day-to-day work, \u201cgenerally meet the duties\nrequirements for the administrative exception.\u201d \u00a7541.203(b). The\nfinancial services example ends with a caveat, noting that \u201can\nemployee whose primary duty is selling financial products does not\nqualify for the administrative exemption.\u201dIbid.In 1999 and again in 2001, the Department\u2019s Wage and Hour\nDivision issued letters opining that mortgage-loan officers do not\nqualify for the administrative exemption. See Opinion Letter, Loan\nOfficers/Exempt Status, 6A LRR, Wages and Hours Manual 99:8351\n(Feb. 16, 2001); Opinion Letter, Mortgage Loan Officers/Exempt\nStatus,id.,at 99:8249. (May 17, 1999). In other words, the\nDepartment concluded that the FLSA\u2019s minimum wage and maximum hour\nrequirements applied to mortgage-loan officers. When the Department\npromulgated its current FLSA regulations in 2004, respondent\nMortgage Bankers Association (MBA), a national trade association\nrepresenting real estate finance companies, requested a new opinion\ninterpreting the revised regulations. In 2006, the Department\nissued an opinion letter finding that mortgage-loan officers fell\nwithin the administrative exemption under the 2004 regulations. See\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 13\u20131041, pp. 70a\u201384a. Four years\nlater, however, the Wage and Hour Division again altered its\ninterpretation of the FLSA\u2019s administrative exemption as it applied\nto mortgage-loan officers.Id.,at 49a\u201369a. Reviewing the\nprovisions of the 2004 regulations and judicial decisions\naddressing the administrative exemption, the Department\u2019s 2010\nAdministrator\u2019s Interpretation concluded that mortgage-loan\nofficers \u201chave a primary duty of making sales for their employers,\nand, therefore, do not qualify\u201d for the administrative exemption.Id.,at 49a, 69a. The Department accordingly withdrew its\n2006 opinion letter, which it now viewed as relying on \u201cmisleading\nassumption[s] and selective and narrow analysis\u201d of the exemption\nexample in \u00a7541.203(b).Id.,at 68a. Like the 1999, 2001,\nand 2006 opinion letters, the 2010 Administrator\u2019s Interpretation\nwas issued without notice or an opportunity for comment.CMBA filed a complaint in Federal District Court challenging the\nAdministrator\u2019s Interpretation. MBA contended that the document was\ninconsistent with the 2004 regulation it purported to interpret,\nand thus arbitrary and capricious in violation of \u00a710 of the APA,5\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7706. More pertinent to this case, MBA also\nargued that the Administrator\u2019s Interpretation was procedurally\nin-valid in light of the D.\u00a0C. Circuit\u2019s decision inParalyzed Veterans, 117 F. 3d 579. Under theParalyzed\nVeteransdoctrine, if \u201can agency has given its regulation a\ndefinitive interpretation, and later significantly revises that\ninterpretation, the agency has in effect amended its rule,\nsomething it may not accomplish\u201d under the APA \u201cwithout notice and\ncomment.\u201dAlaska Professional Hunters Assn., Inc.v.FAA, 177 F. 3d 1030, 1034 (CADC 1999). Three former\nmortgage-loan officers\u2014Beverly Buck, Ryan Henry, and Jerome\nNickols\u2014subsequently intervened in thecase to defend the\nAdministrator\u2019s Interpretation.[2]The District Court granted summary judgment to the Department.Mortgage Bankers Assn.v.Solis, 864 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d\n193 (DC 2012). Though it accepted the parties\u2019 characterization of\nthe Administrator\u2019s Interpretation as an interpretive rule,id.,at 203, n.\u00a07, the District Court determined that\ntheParalyzed Veteransdoctrine was inapplicable because MBA\nhad failed to establish its reliance on the contrary interpretation\nexpressed in the Department\u2019s 2006 opinion letter. The\nAdministrator\u2019s Interpretation, the District Court further\ndetermined, was fully supported by the text of the 2004 FLSA\nregulations. The court accordingly held that the 2010\ninterpretation was not arbitrary or capricious.[3]The D.\u00a0C. Circuit reversed.Mortgage Bankers Assn.v.Harris, 720 F.\u00a03d 966 (2013). Bound to the rule ofParalyzed Veteransby precedent, the Court of Appeals\nrejected the Government\u2019s call to abandon the doctrine. 720\nF.\u00a03d., at 967, n.\u00a01. In the court\u2019s view, \u201c[t]he only\nquestion\u201d properly before it was whether the District Court had\nerred in requiring MBA to prove that it relied on the Department\u2019s\nprior interpretation.Id.,at 967. Explaining that reliance\nwas not a required element of theParalyzed Veteransdoctrine, and noting the Department\u2019s concession that a prior,\nconflicting interpretation of the 2004 regulations existed, the\nD.\u00a0C. Circuit concluded that the 2010 Administrator\u2019s\nInterpretation had to be vacated.We granted certiorari, 573 U.\u00a0S. __ (2014), and now\nreverse.IITheParalyzed Veteransdoctrine is contrary to the clear\ntext of the APA\u2019s rulemaking provisions, and it improperly imposes\non agencies an obligation beyond the \u201cmaximum procedural\nrequirements\u201d specified in the APA,Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power\nCorp.v.Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,435\nU.\u00a0S. 519,524 (1978).AThe text of the APA answers the question presented. Section 4 of\nthe APA provides that \u201cnotice of proposed rule making shall be\npublished in the Federal Register.\u201d5 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7553(b).\nWhen such notice is required by the APA, \u201cthe agency shall give\ninterested persons an opportunity to participate in the rule\nmaking.\u201d \u00a7553(c). But \u00a74 further states that unless \u201cnotice or\nhearing is required by statute,\u201d the Act\u2019s notice-and-comment\nrequirement \u201cdoes not apply .\u00a0.\u00a0. to interpretative\nrules.\u201d \u00a7553(b)(A). This exemption of interpretive rules from the\nnotice-and-comment process is categorical, and it is fatal to the\nrule announced inParalyzed Veterans.Rather than examining the exemption for interpretive rules\ncontained in \u00a74(b)(A) of the APA, the D.\u00a0C. Circuit inParalyzed Veteransfocused its attention on \u00a71 of the Act.\nThat section defines \u201crule making\u201d to include not only the initial\nissuance of new rules, but also \u201crepeal[s]\u201d or \u201camend[ments]\u201d of\nexisting rules. See \u00a7551(5). Because notice-and-comment\nrequirements may apply even to these later agency actions, the\ncourt reasoned, \u201callow[ing] an agency to make a fundamental change\nin its interpretation of a substantive regulation without notice\nand comment\u201d would undermine the APA\u2019s procedural framework. 117\nF.\u00a03d, at 586.This reading of the APA conflates the differing purposes of \u00a7\u00a71\nand 4 of the Act. Section 1 defines what a rule-making is. It does\nnot, however, say what procedures an agency must use when it\nengages in rulemaking. That is the purpose of \u00a74. And \u00a74\nspecifically exempts interpretive rules from the notice-and-comment\nrequirements that apply to legislative rules. So, the D.\u00a0C.\nCircuit correctly read \u00a71 of the APA to mandate that agencies use\nthe same procedures when they amend or repeal a rule as they used\nto issue the rule in the first instance. SeeFCCv.Fox\nTelevision Stations, Inc.,556 U.\u00a0S. 502,515 (2009) (the\nAPA \u201cmake[s] no distinction .\u00a0.\u00a0. between initial agency\naction and subsequent agency action undoing or revising that\naction\u201d). Where the court went wrong was in failing to apply that\naccurate understanding of \u00a71 to the exemption for interpretive\nrules contained in \u00a74: Because an agency is not required to use\nnotice-and-comment procedures to issue an initial interpretive\nrule, it is also not required to use those procedures when it\namends or repeals that interpretive rule.BThe straightforward reading of the APA we now adopt harmonizes\nwith longstanding principles of our administrative law\njurisprudence. Time and again, we have reiterated that the APA\n\u201csets forth the full extent of judicial authority to review\nexecutive agency action for procedural correctness.\u201dFox\nTelevision Stations, Inc., 556 U. S., at 513. Beyond the APA\u2019s\nminimum requirements, courts lack authority \u201cto impose upon [an]\nagency its own notion of which procedures are \u2018best\u2019 or most likely\nto further some vague, undefined public good.\u201dVermont\nYankee, 435 U.\u00a0S., at 549. To do otherwise would violate\n\u201cthe very basic tenet of administrative law that agencies should be\nfree to fashion their own rules of procedure.\u201dId.,at\n544.These foundational principles apply with equal force to the\nAPA\u2019s procedures for rulemaking. We explained inVermont\nYankeethat \u00a74 of the Act \u201cestablished the maximum procedural\nrequirements which Congress was willing to have the courts impose\nupon agencies in conducting rulemaking procedures.\u201dId.,at\n524. \u201cAgencies are free to grant additional procedural rights in\nthe exercise of their discretion, but reviewing courts are\ngenerally not free to impose them if the agencies have not chosen\nto grant them.\u201dIbid.TheParalyzed Veteransdoctrine creates just such a\njudge-made procedural right: the right to notice and an opportunity\nto comment when an agency changes its interpretation of one of the\nregulations it enforces. That requirement may be wise policy. Or it\nmay not. Regardless, imposing such an obligation is the\nresponsibility of Congress or the administrative agencies, not the\ncourts. We trust that Congress weighed the costs and benefits of\nplacing more rigorous procedural restrictions on the issuance of\ninterpretive rules. Seeid.,at 523 (when Congress enacted\nthe APA, it \u201csettled long-continued and hard-fought contentions,\nand enact[ed] a formula upon which opposing social and political\nforces have come to rest\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). In\nthe end, Congress decided to adopt standards that permit agencies\nto promulgate freely such rules\u2014whether or not they are consistent\nwith earlier interpretations. That the D.\u00a0C. Circuit would\nhave struck the balance differently does not permit that court or\nthis one to overturn Congress\u2019 contrary judgment. Cf.Lawv.Siegel, 571 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at\n11).IIIMBA offers several reasons why theParalyzed Veteransdoctrine should be upheld. They are not persuasive.AMBA begins its defense of theParalyzed Veteransdoctrine\nby attempting to bolster the D.\u00a0C. Circuit\u2019s reading of the\nAPA. \u201cParalyzed Veterans,\u201d MBA contends, \u201csimply\nacknowledges the reality that where an agency significantly alters\na prior, definitive interpretation of a regulation, it has\neffectively amended the regulation itself,\u201d something that under\nthe APA requires use of notice-and-comment procedures. Brief for\nRespondent 20\u201321.The act of \u201camending,\u201d however, in both ordinary parlance and\nlegal usage, has its own meaning separate and apart from the act of\n\u201cinterpreting.\u201d Compare Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 98 (10th ed. 2014)\n(defining \u201camend\u201d as \u201c[t]o change the wording of\u201d or \u201cformally\nalter .\u00a0.\u00a0. by striking out, inserting, or substituting\nwords\u201d), withid.,at 943 (defining \u201cinterpret\u201d as \u201c[t]o\nascertain the meaning and significance of thoughts expressed in\nwords\u201d). One would not normally say that a court \u201camends\u201d a statute\nwhen it interprets its text. So too can an agency \u201cinterpret\u201d a\nregulation without \u201ceffectively amend[ing]\u201d the underlying source\nof law. MBA does not explainhow, precisely, an interpretive\nrule changes the regulation it interprets, and its assertion is\nimpossible to reconcile with the longstanding recognition that\ninterpretive rules do not have the force and effect of law. SeeChrysler Corp., 441 U.\u00a0S., at 302, n. 31 (citing\nAttorney General\u2019s Manual on the Administrative Procedure Act 30,\nn.\u00a03 (1947));Skidmorev.Swift & Co.,323\nU.\u00a0S. 134,140 (1944).MBA\u2019s \u201cinterpretation-as-amendment\u201d theory is particularly odd\nin light of the limitations of theParalyzed Veteransdoctrine. Recall that the rule ofParalyzed Veteransapplies\nonly when an agency has previously adopted an interpretation of its\nregulation. Yet in that initial interpretation as much as all that\ncome after, the agency is giving a definite meaning to an ambiguous\ntext\u2014the very act MBA insists requires notice and comment. MBA is\nunable to say why its arguments regarding revised interpretations\nshould not also extend to the agency\u2019s first\ninterpretation.[4]Next, MBA argues that theParalyzed Veteransdoctrine is\nmore consistent with this Court\u2019s \u201cfunctional\u201d approach to\ninterpreting the APA. Relying onChristensenv.Harris\nCounty,529 U.\u00a0S. 576 (2000), andShalalav.Guernsey Memorial Hospital,514 U.\u00a0S. 87, MBA contends\nthat we have already recognized that an agency may not \u201cavoid\nnotice-and-comment procedures by cloaking its actions in the mantle\nof mere \u2018interpretation.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Brief for Respondent 23\u201324.Neither of the cases MBA cites supports its argument. Our\ndecision inChristensendid not address a change in agency\ninterpretation. Instead, we there refused to give deference to an\nagency\u2019s interpretation of an unambiguous regulation, observing\nthat to defer in such a case would allow the agency \u201cto createde\u00a0factoa new regulation.\u201d 529 U.\u00a0S., at 588. Put\ndifferently,Christensenheld that the agency interpretation\nat issue was substantively invalid because it conflicted with the\ntext of the regulation the agency purported to interpret. That\nholding is irrelevant to this suit and to theParalyzed\nVeteransrule, which assesses whether an agency interpretation\nisprocedurallyinvalid.As forGuernsey, that case is fully consistent\nwith\u2014indeed, confirms\u2014what the text of the APA makes plain:\n\u201cInterpretive rules do not require notice and comment.\u201d 514\nU.\u00a0S., at 99. Sidestepping this inconvenient language, MBA\ninstead quotes a portion of the Court\u2019s opinion stating that \u201cAPA\nrulemaking would still be required if [an agency] adopted a new\nposition inconsistent with .\u00a0.\u00a0. existing regulations.\u201dId.,at 100. But the statement on which MBA relies is\ndictum. Worse, it is dictum taken out of context. The \u201cregulations\u201d\nto which the Court referred were two provisions of the Medicare\nreimbursement scheme. And it is apparent from the Court\u2019s\ndescription of these regulations in Part II of the opinion that\nthey were legislative rules, issued through the notice-and-comment\nprocess. Seeid.,at 91\u201392 (noting that the disputed\nregulations were codified in the Code of Federal Regulations). Read\nproperly, then, the cited passage fromGuernseymerely means\nthat \u201can agency may only change its interpretation if the revised\ninterpretation is consistent with the underlying regulations.\u201d\nBrief for Petitioners in No. 13\u20131052, p. 44.BIn the main, MBA attempts to justify theParalyzed\nVeteransdoctrine on practical and policy grounds. MBA contends\nthat the doctrine reinforces the APA\u2019s goal of \u201cprocedural\nfairness\u201d by preventing agencies from unilaterally and unexpectedly\naltering their interpretation of important regulations. Brief for\nRespondent 16.There may be times when an agency\u2019s decision to issue an\ninterpretive rule, rather than a legislative rule, is driven\nprimarily by a desire to skirt notice-and-comment provisions. But\nregulated entities are not without recourse in such situations.\nQuite the opposite. The APA contains a variety of constraints on\nagency decisionmaking\u2014the arbitrary and capricious standard being\namong the most notable. As we held inFox Television\nStations, and underscore again today, the APA requires an\nagency to provide more substantial justification when \u201cits new\npolicy rests upon factual findings that contradict those which\nunderlay its prior policy; or when its prior policy has engendered\nserious reliance interests that must be taken into account. It\nwould be arbitrary and capricious to ignore such matters.\u201d 556\nU.\u00a0S., at 515 (citation omitted); see alsoid.,at 535\n(Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).In addition, Congress is aware that agencies sometimes alter\ntheir views in ways that upset settled reliance interests. For that\nreason, Congress sometimes includes in the statutes it drafts\nsafe-harbor provisions that shelter regulated entities from\nliability when they act in conformance with previous agency\ninterpretations. The FLSA includes one such provision: As amended\nby the Portal-to-Portal Act of 1947,29 U. S. C. \u00a7251et\u00a0seq.,the FLSA provides that \u201cno employer shall be\nsubject to any liability\u201d for failing \u201cto pay minimum wages or\novertime compensation\u201d if it demonstrates that the \u201cact or omission\ncomplained of was in good faith in conformity with and in reliance\non any written administrative regulation, order, ruling, approval,\nor interpretation\u201d of the Administrator of the Department\u2019s Wage\nand Hour Division, even when the guidance is later \u201cmodified or\nrescinded.\u201d \u00a7\u00a7259(a), (b)(1). These safe harbors will often protect\nparties from liability when an agency adopts an interpretation that\nconflicts with its previous position.[5]CMBA changes direction in the second half of its brief,\ncontending that if the Court overturns theParalyzed\nVeteransrule, the D.\u00a0C. Circuit\u2019s judgment should\nnonetheless be affirmed. That is so, MBA says, because the agency\ninterpretation at issue\u2014the 2010 Administrator\u2019s\nInterpretation\u2014should in fact be classified as a legislative\nrule.We will not address this argument. From the beginning, the\nparties litigated this suit on the understanding that the\nAdministrator\u2019s Interpretation was\u2014as its name suggests\u2014an\ninterpretive rule. Indeed, if MBA did not think the Administrator\u2019s\nInterpretation was an interpretive rule, then its decision to\ninvoke theParalyzed Veteransdoctrine in attacking the rule\nis passing strange. After all,Paralyzed Veteransapplied\nonly to interpretive rules. Consequently, neither the District\nCourt nor the D.\u00a0C. Circuit considered MBA\u2019s current claim\nthat the Administrator\u2019s Interpretation is actually a legislative\nrule. Beyond that, and more important still, MBA\u2019s brief in\nopposition to certiorari did not dispute petitioners\u2019 assertions\u2014in\ntheir framing of the question presented and in the substance of\ntheir petitions\u2014that the Administrator\u2019s Interpretation is an\ninterpretive rule. Thus, even assuming MBA did not waive the\nargument below, it has done so in this Court. See this Court\u2019s Rule\n15.2;Carcieriv.Salazar,555 U.\u00a0S. 379\u2013396\n(2009).*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the United States\nCourt of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit is\nreversed.It is so ordered.Notes1The latter is the more common\nphrasing today, and the one we use throughout this\nopinion.2Buck, Henry, and Nickols are\npetitioners in No. 13\u20131052 and respondents in No.\n13\u20131041.3MBA did not challenge this aspect of\nthe District Court\u2019s decision on appeal.4MBA alternatively suggests that\ninterpretive rules have the force of law because an agency\u2019s\ninterpretation of its own regulations may be entitled to deference\nunderAuerv.Robbins,519 U.\u00a0S. 452 (1997), andBowlesv.Seminole Rock & Sand Co.,325 U.\u00a0S.\n410 (1945). Even in cases where an agency\u2019s interpretation receivesAuerdeference, how-ever, it is the court that ultimately\ndecides whether a given regulation means what the agency says.\nMoreover,Auerdeference is not an inexorable command in all\ncases. SeeChristopherv.SmithKline Beecham Corp.,\n567 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 10) (Auerdeference is inappropriate \u201cwhen the agency\u2019s interpretation is\nplainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation\u201d or \u201cwhen\nthere is reason to suspect that the agency\u2019s interpretation does\nnot reflect the agency\u2019s fair and considered judgment\u201d (internal\nquotation marks omitted));Thomas Jefferson Univ.v.Shalala,512 U.\u00a0S. 504,515 (1994) (\u201c[A]n agency\u2019s\ninterpretation of a .\u00a0.\u00a0. regulation that conflicts with\na prior interpretation is entitled to considerably less deference\nthan a consistently held agency view\u201d (internal quotation marks\nomitted)).5The United States acknowledged at\nargument that even in situations where a statute does not contain a\nsafe-harbor provision similar to the one included in the FLSA, an\nagency\u2019s ability to pursue enforcement actions against regulated\nentities for conduct in conformance with prior agency\ninterpretations may be limited by principles of retroactiv-ity. See\nTr. of Oral Arg. 44\u201345. We have no occasion to consider how such\nprinciples might apply here.",
