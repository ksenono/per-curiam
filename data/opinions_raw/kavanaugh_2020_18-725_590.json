BARR, ATTORNEY GENERALon writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the eleventh circuit[April 23, 2020]Justice Kavanaugh delivered the opinion of the\nCourt.Under the immigration laws, a noncitizen who is\nauthorized to live permanently in the United States is a lawful\npermanent resident\u2014also commonly known as a green-card holder. But\nunlike a U.\u00a0S. citizen, a lawful permanent resident who\ncommits a serious crime may be removed from the United States.Andre Barton is a Jamaican national and a\nlongtime lawful permanent resident of the United States. During his\ntime in the United States, Barton has been convicted of state\ncrimes on three separate occasions spanning 12 years. The crimes\ninclude a firearms offense, drug offenses, and aggravated assault\noffenses. By law, the firearms offense and the drug offenses each\nindependently rendered Barton eligible for removal from the United\nStates. In September 2016, the U.\u00a0S. Government sought to\nremove Barton, and a U.\u00a0S. Immigration Judge determined that\nBarton was removable.Barton applied for cancellation of removal, a\nform of relief that allows a noncitizen to remain in the United\nStates despite being found removable. The immigration laws\nauthorize an immigration judge to cancel removal, but Congress has\nestablished strict eligibility requirements. See 8\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a71229b(a), (d)(1)(B). For a lawful permanent\nresident such as Barton, the applicant for cancellation of removal\n(1) must have been a lawful permanent resident for at least five\nyears; (2) must have continuously resided in the United States for\nat least seven years after lawful admission; (3) must not have been\nconvicted of an aggravated felony as defined in the immigration\nlaws; and (4) during the initial seven years of continuous\nresidence, must not have committed certain other offenses listed in\n8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71182(a)(2). If a lawful permanent resident\nmeets those eligibility requirements, the immigration judge has\ndiscretion to (but is not required to) cancel removal and allow the\nlawful permanent resident to remain in the United States.Under the cancellation-of-removal statute, the\nimmigration judge examines the applicant\u2019s prior crimes, as well as\nthe offense that triggered his removal. If a lawful permanent\nresident has ever been convicted of an aggravated felony, or has\ncommitted an offense listed in \u00a71182(a)(2) during the initial seven\nyears of residence, that criminal record will preclude cancellation\nof removal.[1] In that way, the\nstatute operates like traditional criminal recidivist laws, which\nordinarily authorize or impose greater sanctions on offenders who\nhave committed prior crimes.In this case, after finding Barton removable\nbased on his state firearms and drug offenses, the Immigration\nJudge and the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) concluded that\nBarton was not eligible for cancellation of removal. Barton had\ncommitted offenses listed in \u00a71182(a)(2) during his initial seven\nyears of residence\u2014namely, his state aggravated assault offenses in\n1996. Barton\u2019s 1996 aggravated assault offenses were not the\noffenses that triggered his removal. But according to the BIA, and\ncontrary to Barton\u2019s argument, the offense that precludes\ncancellation of removal need not be one of the offenses of removal.In re Jurado-Delgado, 24 I.\u00a0&\u00a0N. Dec. 29, 31\n(BIA 2006). The U.\u00a0S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh\nCircuit agreed with the BIA\u2019s reading of the statute and concluded\nthat Barton was not eligible for cancellation of removal. The\nSecond, Third, and Fifth Circuits have similarly construed the\nstatute; only the Ninth Circuit has disagreed.Barton argues that the BIA and the Eleventh\nCircuit misinterpreted the statute. He contends that the\n\u00a71182(a)(2) offense that precludes cancellation of removal must be\none of the offenses of removal. We disagree with Barton, and we\naffirm the judgment of the U.\u00a0S. Court of Appeals for the\nEleventh Circuit.IFederal immigration law governs the admission\nof noncitizens to the United States and the deportation of\nnoncitizens previously admitted. See 8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7\u00a71182(a), 1227(a), 1229a.[2]\nThe umbrella statutory term for being inadmissible or deportable is\n\u201cremovable.\u201d \u00a71229a(e)(2).A noncitizen who is authorized to live\npermanently in the United States is a lawful permanent resident,\noften known as a green-card holder. When a lawful permanent\nresident commits a crime and is determined by an immigration judge\nto be removable because of that crime, the Attorney General\n(usually acting through an immigration judge) may cancel removal.\n\u00a71229b(a). But the comprehensive immigration law that Congress\npassed and President Clinton signed in 1996 tightly cabins\neligibility for cancellation of removal. See Illegal Immigration\nReform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, 110Stat. 3009\u2013546,\n8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71101 note.For a lawful permanent resident, the\ncancellation-of- removal statute provides that an immigration judge\n\u201cmay cancel removal in the case of an alien who is inadmissible or\ndeportable from the United States if the alien\u2014(1) has been an\nalien lawfully admitted for permanent residence for not less than 5\nyears, (2) has resided in the United States continuously for 7\nyears after having been admitted in any status, and (3) has not\nbeen convicted of any aggravated felony.\u201d \u00a71229b(a).[3]The statute imposes one other requirement known\nas the \u201cstop-time rule.\u201d As relevant here, the statute provides\nthat a lawful permanent resident, during the initial seven years of\nresidence, also cannot have committed \u201can offense referred to in\nsection 1182(a)(2) of this title that renders the alien\ninadmissible to the United States under section 1182(a)(2) of this\ntitle or removable from the United States under section 1227(a)(2)\nor 1227(a)(4) of this title.\u201d \u00a71229b(d)(1)(B).Andre Barton is a Jamaican national and a lawful\npermanent resident of the United States. In 1996, he was convicted\nin a Georgia court of a firearms offense stemming from an incident\nwhere Barton and a friend shot up the house of Barton\u2019s\nex-girlfriend. In separate proceedings in 2007 and 2008, he was\nconvicted in Georgia courts of state drug offenses. One case\ninvolved methamphetamine, and the other involved cocaine and\nmarijuana.In 2016, the U.\u00a0S. Government charged\nBarton with deportability under 8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71227(a)(2)\nbased on the 1996 firearms offense and the 2007 and 2008 drug\ncrimes. See \u00a7\u00a71227(a)(2)(B)(i), (C). Barton conceded that he was\nremovable based on his criminal co nvictions for the firearms\noffense and drug offenses, and an Immigration Judge found him\nremovable.Barton applied for cancellation of removal. All\nagree that Barton meets two of the eligibility requirements for\ncancellation of removal. He has been a lawful permanent resident\nfor more than five years. And he has not been convicted of an\n\u201caggravated felony,\u201d as defined by the immigration laws.The Immigration Judge concluded, however, that\nBarton had committed an offense listed in \u00a71182(a)(2) during his\ninitial seven years of residence. In 1996, 61\u22152 years after his\nadmission to this country, Barton committed aggravated assault\noffenses for which he was later convicted in a Georgia court. The\nImmigration Judge concluded that those aggravated assault offenses\nwere covered by \u00a71182(a)(2) and that Barton was therefore not\neligible for cancellation of removal.The Board of Immigration Appeals and the\nU.\u00a0S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit likewise\nconcluded that Barton was not eligible for cancellation of removal.Bartonv.United States Atty. Gen., 904 F.3d 1294,\n1302 (2018). The key question was whether the offense that\nprecludes cancellation of removal (here, Barton\u2019s 1996 aggravated\nassault offenses) must also be one of the offenses of\nremoval.[4] The Board of\nImmigration Appeals has long interpreted the statute to mean that\n\u201can alien need not actually be charged and found inadmissible or\nremovable on the applicable ground in order for the criminal\nconduct in question to terminate continuous residence in this\ncountry\u201d and preclude cancellation of removal.Jurado-Delgado, 24 I.\u00a0&\u00a0N. Dec., at 31. In\nthis case, the Eleventh Circuit likewise indicated that the\n\u00a71182(a)(2) offense that precludes cancellation of removal need not\nbe one of the offenses of removal. 904 F.\u00a03d, at 1299\u20131300.\nAnd the Second, Third, and Fifth Circuits have similarly construed\nthe statute. SeeHerediav.Sessions, 865 F.3d 60, 68\n(CA2 2017);Ardonv.Attorney GeneralofUnited States, 449 Fed. Appx. 116, 118 (CA3 2011);Calixv.Lynch, 784 F.3d 1000, 1011 (CA5 2015).But in 2018, the Ninth Circuit disagreed with\nthose courts and with the BIA. The Ninth Circuit ruled that a\nlawful permanent resident\u2019s commission of an offense listed in\n\u00a71182(a)(2) makes the noncitizen ineligible for cancellation of\nremoval only if that offense was one of the offenses of removal.Nguyenv.Sessions, 901 F.3d 1093, 1097 (2018). Under\nthe Ninth Circuit\u2019s approach, Barton would have been eligible for\ncancellation of removal because his \u00a71182(a)(2) offenses (his 1996\naggravated assault offenses) were not among the offenses of removal\n(his 1996 firearms offense and his 2007 and 2008 drug crimes).In light of the division in the Courts of\nAppeals over how to interpret this statute, we granted certiorari.\n587 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2019).IIAUnder the immigration laws, when a noncitizen\nhas committed a serious crime, the U.\u00a0S. Government may seek\nto remove that noncitizen by initiating removal proceedings before\nan immigration judge. If the immigration judge determines that the\nnoncitizen is removable, the immigration judge nonetheless has\ndiscretion to cancel removal. But the immigration laws impose\nstrict eligibility requirements for cancellation of removal. To\nreiterate, a lawful permanent resident such as Barton who has been\nfound removable because of criminal activity is eligible for\ncancellation of removal \u201cif the alien\u2014(1) has been an alien\nlawfully admitted for permanent residence for not less than 5\nyears, (2) has resided in the United States continuously for 7\nyears after having been admitted in any status, and (3) has not\nbeen convicted of any aggravated felony.\u201d \u00a71229b(a).To be eligible for cancellation of removal, the\nlawful permanent resident, during the initial seven years of\nresidence after admission, also must not have committed \u201can offense\nreferred to in section 1182(a)(2) of this title that renders the\nalien inadmissible to the United States under section 1182(a)(2) of\nthis title or removable from the United States under section\n1227(a)(2) or 1227(a)(4) of this title.\u201d \u00a71229b(d)(1)(B).The law therefore fashions two distinct ways in\nwhich a lawful permanent resident\u2019s prior crimes may preclude\ncancellation of removal.The law precludes cancellation of removal if the\nlawful permanent resident has been convicted of an \u201caggravated\nfelony\u201dat any time. The statutory list of aggravated\nfelonies is long: murder, rape, drug trafficking, firearms\ntrafficking, obstruction of justice, treason, gambling, human\ntrafficking, and tax evasion, among many other crimes.\n\u00a7\u00a71101(a)(43)(A)\u2013(U).In addition, the law precludes cancellation of\nremoval if the lawful permanent resident committed certain other\nserious crimesduring the initial seven years of residence.\nThe law defines those offenses by cross-referencing \u00a71182(a)(2),\nwhich specifies the offenses that can render a noncitizen\n\u201cinadmissible\u201d to the United States. Section 1182(a)(2) includes\n\u201ccrime[s] involving moral turpitude,\u201d which is a general category\nthat covers a wide variety of crimes. Section 1182(a)(2) also\nexpressly encompasses various violations of drug laws,\nprostitution, money laundering, and certain DUIs involving personal\ninjury, among other crimes. \u00a7\u00a71182(a)(2)(A)(i), (C), (D), (E), (I);\nsee \u00a71101(h).In specifying when cancellation of removal would\nbe precluded because of prior criminal activity, Congress struck a\nbalance that considers both the nature of the prior crime and the\nlength of time that the noncitizen has resided in the United\nStates. If a lawful permanent resident has been convicted at any\ntime of certain crimes (what the immigration laws refer to as an\n\u201caggravated felony\u201d), then the noncitizen is not eligible for\ncancellation of removal. If during the initial 7-year period of\nresidence, a lawful permanent resident committed certain other\noffenses referred to in \u00a71182(a)(2), then the noncitizen likewise\nis not eligible for cancellation of removal.In providing that a noncitizen\u2019s prior crimes\n(in addition to the offense of removal) can render him ineligible\nfor cancellation of removal, the cancellation-of-removal statute\nfunctions like a traditional recidivist sentencing statute. In an\nordinary criminal case, a defendant may be convicted of a\nparticular criminal offense. And at sentencing, the defendant\u2019s\nother criminal offenses may be relevant. So too in the immigration\nremoval context. A noncitizen may be found removable based on a\ncertain criminal offense. In applying for cancellation of removal,\nthe noncitizen must detail his entire criminal record on Form\nEOIR\u201342A. An immigration judge then must determine whether the\nnoncitizen has been convicted of an aggravated felony at any time\nor has committed a \u00a71182(a)(2) offense during the initial seven\nyears of residence. It is entirely ordinary to look beyond the\noffense of conviction at criminal sentencing, and it is likewise\nentirely ordinary to look beyond the offense of removal at the\ncancellation-of-removal stage in immigration cases.[5]It is not surprising, moreover, that Congress\nrequired immigration judges considering cancellation of removal to\nlook in part at whether the noncitizen has committed any offenses\nlisted in \u00a71182(a)(2). The offenses listed in \u00a71182(a)(2) help\ndetermine whether a noncitizen should be admitted to the United\nStates. Under the cancellation-of-removal statute, immigration\njudges must look at that same category of offenses to determine\nwhether, after a previously admitted noncitizen has been determined\nto be deportable, the noncitizen should nonetheless be allowed to\nremain in the United States. If a crime is serious enough to deny\nadmission to a noncitizen, the crime can also be serious enough to\npreclude cancellation of removal, at least if committed during the\ninitial seven years of residence.Importantly, the text of the\ncancellation-of-removal statute does not simply say that\ncancellation of removal is precluded when, during the initial seven\nyears of residence, the noncitizen wasconvictedof an\noffense referred to in \u00a71182(a)(2). Rather, the text says that\ncancellation of removal is precluded when, during the initial seven\nyears of residence, the noncitizen \u201ccommitted an offense referred\nto in section 1182(a)(2) .\u00a0.\u00a0. that renders the alien\ninadmissible.\u201d \u00a71229b(d)(1)(B). That language clarifies two points\nof relevance here.First, cancellation of removal is\nprecluded if a noncitizencommitteda \u00a71182(a)(2) offense\nduring the initial seven years of residence, even if (as in\nBarton\u2019s case) theconvictionoccurred after the seven years\nelapsed. In other words, as Congress specified in the statute and\nas the BIA and the Courts of Appeals have recognized, the date ofcommissionof the offense is the key date for purposes of\ncalculating whether the noncitizen committed a \u00a71182(a)(2) offense\nduring the initial seven years of residence. SeeIn\u00a0re\nPerez, 22 I.\u00a0&\u00a0N. Dec. 689, 693\u2013694 (BIA 1999)\n(date of commission is controlling date); see alsoHeredia,\n865 F.\u00a03d, at 70\u201371 (\u201cthe date of thecommissionof the\noffense governs the computation of a lawful permanent resident\u2019s\ncontinuous residency in the United States\u201d);Calix, 784\nF.\u00a03d, at 1012 (\u201cOnce he was convicted of the offense\u201d\nreferred to in \u00a71182(a)(2), \u201che was rendered inadmissible to the\nUnited States. His accrual of continuous residence was halted as of\nthe date he committed that offense\u201d).Second, the text of the law requires that\nthe noncitizen be rendered \u201cinadmissible\u201d as a result of the\noffense. For crimes involving moral turpitude, which is the\nrelevant category of \u00a71182(a)(2) offenses here, \u00a71182(a)(2)\nprovides that a noncitizen is rendered \u201cinadmissible\u201d when he is\nconvicted of or admits the offense. \u00a71182(a)(2)(A)(i). As the\nEleventh Circuit explained, \u201cwhile only commission is required at\nstep one, conviction (or admission) is required at step two.\u201d 904\nF.\u00a03d, at 1301.In this case, Barton\u2019s 1996 state aggravated\nassault offenses were crimes involving moral turpitude and\ntherefore \u201creferred to in section 1182(a)(2).\u201d Barton committed\nthose offenses during his initial seven years of residence. He was\nlater convicted of the offenses in a Georgia court and thereby\nrendered \u201cinadmissible.\u201d Therefore, Barton was ineligible for\ncancellation of removal.As a matter of statutory text and structure,\nthat analysis is straightforward. The Board of Immigration Appeals\nhas long interpreted the statute that way. SeeJurado-Delgado, 24 I.\u00a0&\u00a0N. Dec., at 31. And\nexcept for the Ninth Circuit, all of the Courts of Appeals to\nconsider the question have interpreted the statute that way.BBarton pushes back on that straightforward\nstatutory interpretation and the longstanding position of the Board\nof Immigration Appeals. Barton says that he may not be denied\ncancellation of removal based on his 1996 aggravated assault\noffenses because those offenses were not among the offenses of\nremoval found by the Immigration Judge in Barton\u2019s removal\nproceeding. Rather, his 1996 firearms offense and his 2007 and 2008\ndrug offenses were the offenses of removal.To succinctly summarize the parties\u2019 different\npositions (with the difference highlighted in italics below): The\nGovernment would preclude cancellation of removal under this\nprovision if the lawful permanent resident committed a \u00a71182(a)(2)\noffense during the initial seven years of residence. Barton would\npreclude cancellation of removal under this provision if the lawful\npermanent resident committed a \u00a71182(a)(2) offense during the\ninitial seven years of residenceand if that \u00a71182(a)(2) offense\nwas one of the offenses of removal in the noncitizen\u2019s removal\nproceeding.To support his \u201coffense of removal\u201d approach,\nBarton advances three different arguments. A caution to the reader:\nThese arguments are not easy to unpack.First, according to Barton, the statute\u2019s\noverall structure with respect to removal proceedings demonstrates\nthat a \u00a71182(a)(2) offense may preclude cancellation of removal\nonly if that \u00a71182(a)(2) offense was one of the offenses of\nremoval. We disagree. In removal proceedings, a lawful permanent\nresident (such as Barton) may be found \u201cdeportable\u201d based on\ndeportability offenses listed in \u00a71227(a)(2). A noncitizen who has\nnot previously been admitted may be found \u201cinadmissible\u201d based on\ninadmissibility offenses listed in \u00a71182(a)(2). See \u00a7\u00a71182(a),\n1227(a), 1229a(e)(2). Importantly, then, \u00a71227(a)(2) offenses\u2014not\n\u00a71182(a)(2) offenses\u2014are typically the basis for removal of lawful\npermanent residents.Because the offense of removal for lawful\npermanent residents is ordinarily a \u00a71227(a)(2) offense, Barton\u2019s\nstructural argument falls apart. If Barton were correct that this\naspect of the cancellation-of-removal statute focused only on the\noffense of removal, the statute presumably would specify offenses\n\u201creferred to in section 1182(a)(2)or section 1227(a)(2).\u201d\nSo why does the statute identify only offenses \u201creferred to in\nsection 1182(a)(2)\u201d? Barton has no good answer. At oral argument,\nwhen directly asked that question, Barton\u2019s able counsel\nforthrightly acknowledged: \u201cIt\u2019s a little hard to explain.\u201d Tr. of\nOral Arg. 27.This point is the Achilles\u2019 heel of Barton\u2019s\nstructural argument. As we see it, Barton cannot explain the\nomission of \u00a71227(a)(2) offenses in the \u201creferred to\u201d clause for a\nsimple reason: Barton\u2019s interpretation of the statute is incorrect.\nProperly read, this is not simply an \u201coffense of removal\u201d statute\nthat looks only at whether the offense of removal was committed\nduring the initial seven years of residence. Rather, this is a\nrecidivist statute that uses \u00a71182(a)(2) offenses as a shorthand\ncross-reference for a category of offenses that will preclude\ncancellation of removal if committed during the initial seven years\nof residence.By contrast to this cancellation-of-removal\nprovision, some other provisions of the immigration laws do focus\nonly on the offense of removal\u2014for example, provisions governing\nmandatory detention and jurisdiction. See \u00a7\u00a71226(a), (c)(1)(A),\n(B), 1252(a)(2)(C). But the statutory text and context of those\nprovisions support that limitation. Those provisions use the phrase\n\u201cinadmissible by reason of\u00a0\u201d a \u00a71182(a)(2) offense,\n\u201cdeportable by reason of\u00a0\u201d a \u00a71227(a)(2) offense, or\n\u201cremovable by reason of\u00a0\u201d a \u00a71182(a)(2) or \u00a71227(a)(2)\noffense. And the provisions make contextual sense only if the\noffense justifying detention or denying jurisdiction is one of the\noffenses of removal. The cancellation-of-removal statute does not\nemploy similar language.Second, moving from overall structure to\nprecise text, Barton seizes on the statutory phrase \u201ccommitted an\noffense referred to in section 1182(a)(2) .\u00a0.\u00a0.that\nrenders the alien inadmissible to the United States under section\n1182(a)(2).\u201d \u00a71229b(d)(1)(B) (emphasis added). According to\nBarton, conviction of an offense listed in \u00a71182(a)(2)\u2014for example,\nconviction in state court of a crime involving moral turpitude\u2014does\nnot itself render the noncitizen \u201cinadmissible.\u201d He argues that a\nnoncitizen is not rendered \u201cinadmissible\u201d unless and until the\nnoncitizen is actually adjudicated as inadmissible and denied\nadmission to the United States. And he further contends that a\nlawfully admitted noncitizen usually cannot be removed from the\nUnited States on the basis of inadmissibility. As Barton puts it\n(and the dissent echoes the point), how can a lawfully admitted\nnoncitizen be found inadmissible when he has already been lawfully\nadmitted?As a matter of common parlance alone, that\nargument would of course carry some force. But the argument fails\nbecause it disregards the statutory text, which employs the term\n\u201cinadmissibility\u201d as a status that can result from, for example, a\nnoncitizen\u2019s (including a lawfully admitted noncitizen\u2019s)\ncommission of certain offenses listed in \u00a71182(a)(2).For example, as relevant here, \u00a71182(a)(2)\nflatly says that a noncitizen such as Barton who commits a crime\ninvolving moral turpitude and is convicted of that offense \u201cis\ninadmissible.\u201d \u00a71182(a)(2)(A)(i). Full stop. Similarly, a\nnoncitizen who has two or more convictions, together resulting in\naggregate sentences of at least five years, \u201cis inadmissible.\u201d\n\u00a71182(a)(2)(B). A noncitizen who a consular officer or the Attorney\nGeneral knows or has reason to believe is a drug trafficker \u201cis\ninadmissible.\u201d \u00a71182(a)(2)(C)(i). A noncitizen who receives the\nproceeds of prostitution within 10 years of applying for admission\n\u201cis inadmissible.\u201d \u00a71182(a)(2)(D)(ii). The list goes on. See,e.g.,\u00a7\u00a71182(a)(2)(C)(ii)\u2013(E), (G)\u2013(I). Those provisions do\nnot say that a noncitizen willbecomeinadmissible if the\nnoncitizen is found inadmissible in a subsequent immigration\nremoval proceeding. Instead, those provisions say that the\nnoncitizen \u201cis inadmissible.\u201dCongress has in turn made that\nstatus\u2014inadmissibility because of conviction or other proof of\ncommission of \u00a71182(a)(2) offenses\u2014relevant in several statutory\ncontexts that apply to lawfully admitted noncitizens such as\nBarton. Those contexts include adjustment to permanent resident\nstatus; protection from removal because of temporary protected\nstatus; termination of temporary resident status; and here\ncancellation of removal. See,e.g.,\u00a7\u00a71160(a)(1)(C),\n(a)(3)(B)(ii), 1254a(a)(1)(A), (c)(1)(A)(iii), 1255(a),\n(l)(2). In those contexts, the noncitizen faces immigration\nconsequences from being convicted of a \u00a71182(a)(2) offense even\nthough the noncitizen is lawfully admitted and is not necessarily\nremovable solely because of that offense.Consider how those other proceedings work. A\nlawfully admitted noncitizen who is convicted of an offense listed\nin \u00a71182(a)(2) is typically not removable from the United States on\nthat basis (recall that a lawfully admitted noncitizen is\nordinarily removable only for commission of a \u00a71227(a)(2) offense).\nBut the noncitizen is \u201cinadmissible\u201d because of the \u00a71182(a)(2)\noffense and for that reason may not be able to obtain adjustment to\npermanent resident status. \u00a7\u00a71255(a), (l)(2). So too, a\nlawfully admitted noncitizen who is convicted of an offense listed\nin \u00a71182(a)(2) is \u201cinadmissible\u201d and for that reason may not be\nable to obtain temporary protected status. \u00a7\u00a71254a(a)(1)(A),\n(c)(1)(A)(iii). A lawfully admitted noncitizen who is a temporary\nresident and is convicted of a \u00a71182(a)(2) offense is\n\u201cinadmissible\u201d and for that reason may lose temporary resident\nstatus. \u00a7\u00a71160(a)(1)(C), (a)(3)(B)(ii).Those statutory examples pose a major hurdle for\nBarton\u2019s textual argument. The examples demonstrate that Congress\nhas employed the concept of \u201cinadmissibility\u201d as a status in a\nvariety of statutes similar to the cancellation-of-removal statute,\nincluding for lawfully admitted noncitizens. Barton has no\npersuasive answer to those examples. Barton tries to say that some\nof those other statutes involve a noncitizen who, although already\nadmitted to the United States, is nonetheless seeking \u201cconstructive\nadmission.\u201d Reply Brief 12; Tr. of Oral Arg. 11. But that ginned-up\nlabel does not avoid the problem. Put simply, those other statutes\nshow that lawfully admitted noncitizens who are, for example,\nconvicted of \u00a71182(a)(2) crimes are \u201cinadmissible\u201d and in turn may\nsuffer certain immigration consequences, even though those lawfully\nadmitted noncitizens cannot necessarily be removed solely because\nof those \u00a71182(a)(2) offenses.The same is true here. A lawfully admitted\nnoncitizen who was convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude\nduring his initial seven years of residence is \u201cinadmissible\u201d and\nfor that reason is ineligible for cancellation of removal.In advancing his structural and textual\narguments, Barton insists that his interpretation of the statute\nreflects congressional intent regarding cancellation of removal.\nBut if Congress intended that only the offense of removal would\npreclude cancellation of removal under the 7-year residence\nprovision, it is unlikely that Congress would have employed such a\nconvoluted way to express that intent. Barton cannot explain why,\nif his view of Congress\u2019 intent is correct, the statute does not\nsimply say something like: \u201cThe alien is not eligible for\ncancellation of removal if the offense of removal was committed\nduring the alien\u2019s initial seven years of residence.\u201dThird, on a different textual tack,\nBarton argues that the Government\u2019s interpretation cannot be\ncorrect because the Government would treat as surplusage the phrase\n\u201cor removable from the United States under section 1227(a)(2) or\n1227(a)(4) of this title.\u201d Recall that the statute, as relevant\nhere, provides that a lawful permanent resident is not eligible for\ncancellation of removal if, during the initial seven years of\nresidence, he committed \u201can offense referred to in section\n1182(a)(2) of this title that renders the alien inadmissible to the\nUnited States under section 1182(a)(2) of this titleor\nremovable from the United States under section 1227(a)(2) or\n1227(a)(4) of this title.\u201d \u00a71229b(d)(1)(B) (emphasis\nadded).To begin with, all agree that under either\nside\u2019s interpretation, the reference to \u00a71227(a)(4)\u2014as distinct\nfrom \u00a71227(a)(2)\u2014is redundant surplusage. See \u00a71229b(c)(4); Brief\nfor Petitioner 32\u201333 & n.\u00a07. Under the Government\u2019s\ninterpretation, it is true that the reference to \u00a71227(a)(2) also\nappears to be redundant surplusage. Any offense that is both\nreferred to in \u00a71182(a)(2) and an offense that would render the\nnoncitizen deportable under \u00a71227(a)(2) would also render the\nnoncitizen inadmissible under \u00a71182(a)(2). But redundancies are\ncommon in statutory drafting\u2014sometimes in a congressional effort to\nbe doubly sure, sometimes because of congressional inadvertence or\nlack of foresight, or sometimes simply because of the shortcomings\nof human communication. The Court has often recognized: \u201cSometimes\nthe better overall reading of the statute contains some\nredundancy.\u201dRimini Street, Inc.v.Oracle USA, Inc.,\n586 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2019) (slip op., at 11); seeWisconsin\nCentral Ltd.v.United States, 585 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___\n(2018) (slip op., at 7);Marxv.General Revenue\nCorp.,568 U.S.\n371, 385 (2013);Lamiev.United States Trustee,540 U.S.\n526, 536 (2004). So it is here. Most importantly for present\npurposes, we do not see why the redundant statutory reference to\n\u00a71227(a)(2) should cause us to entirely rewrite \u00a71229b so that a\nnoncitizen\u2019s commission of an offense referred to in \u00a71182(a)(2)\nwould preclude cancellation of removal only if it is also the\noffense of removal. Redundancy in one portion of a statute is not a\nlicense to rewrite or eviscerate another portion of the statute\ncontrary to its text, as Barton would have us do.One final point: Barton argues in the\nalternative that even if inadmissibility is a status, and even if\nthe offense that precludes cancellation of removal need not be one\nof the offenses of removal, the noncitizen must at least have beencapableofbeing charged with a \u00a71182(a)(2)\ninadmissibility offense as the basis for removal. The dissent\nseizes on this argument as well. But as we have explained, this\ncancellation-of-removal statute is a recidivist statute that\nprecludes cancellation of removal if the noncitizen has committed\nan offense listed in \u00a71182(a)(2) during the initial seven years of\nresidence. Whether the offense that precludes cancellation of\nremoval was charged or could have been charged as one of the\noffenses of removal is irrelevant to that analysis.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*Removal of a lawful permanent resident from\nthe United States is a wrenching process, especially in light of\nthe consequences for family members. Removal is particularly\ndifficult when it involves someone such as Barton who has spent\nmost of his life in the United States. Congress made a choice,\nhowever, to authorize removal of noncitizens\u2014even lawful permanent\nresidents\u2014who have committed certain serious crimes. And Congress\nalso made a choice to categorically preclude cancellation of\nremoval for noncitizens who have substantial criminal records.\nCongress may of course amend the law at any time. In the meantime,\nthe Court is constrained to apply the law as enacted by Congress.\nHere, as the BIA explained in its 2006Jurado- Delgadodecision, and as the Second, Third, Fifth, and Eleventh Circuits\nhave indicated, the immigration laws enacted by Congress do not\nallow cancellation of removal when a lawful permanent resident has\namassed a criminal record of this kind.We affirm the judgment of the U.\u00a0S. Court\nof Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.It is so ordered.Notes1As the statute makes\nclear, and as we discuss below,committinga \u00a71182(a)(2)\noffense precludes cancellation of removal only if the offense also\n\u201crenders\u201d the noncitizen inadmissible. Seeinfra, at 10.\nSection 1182(a)(2) specifies what that means for each of its\nenumerated offenses. For the offense at issue in this case, the\nnoncitizen must also have been convicted of or admitted the\noffense.2This opinion uses the\nterm \u201cnoncitizen\u201d as equivalent to the statutory term \u201calien.\u201d See\n8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71101(a)(3).3The immigration laws\nimpose a similar but even stricter set of eligibility requirements\nfor noncitizens who are not lawful permanent residents.\n\u00a71229b(b).4The term \u201coffense of\nremoval\u201d describes the offense that was the ground on which the\nimmigration judge, at the removal proceeding, found the noncitizen\nremovable.5If the offense of removal\nitself was an aggravated felony or was an offense listed in\n\u00a71182(a)(2) that was committed during the initial seven years of\nresidence, then the offense of removal alone precludes cancellation\nof removal, regardless of whether the noncitizen has an additional\nrecord of prior crimes.",
