That\nAmendment transferred power to choose United States Senators from\n\u201cthe Legislature\u201d of each State, Art.\u00a0I, \u00a73, to \u201cthe people\nthereof.\u201d The Amendment re-sulted from an arduous, decades-long\ncampaign in which reformers across the country worked hard to\ngarner approval from Congress and three-quarters of the States.What chumps! Didn\u2019t they realize that all they\nhad to do was interpret the constitutional term \u201cthe Legislature\u201d\nto mean \u201cthe people\u201d? The Court today performs just such a magic\ntrick with the Elections Clause. Art.\u00a0I, \u00a74. That Clause vests\ncongressional redistricting authority in \u201cthe Legislature\u201d of each\nState. An Arizona ballot initiative transferred that authority from\n\u201cthe Legislature\u201d to an \u201cIndependent Redistricting Commission.\u201d The\nmajority approves this deliberate constitutional evasion by doing\nwhat the proponents of the Seventeenth Amendment dared not:\nrevising \u201cthe Legislature\u201d to mean \u201cthe people.\u201dThe Court\u2019s position has no basis in the text,\nstructure, or history of the Constitution, and it contradicts\nprecedents from both Congress and this Court. The Constitution\ncontains seventeen provisions referring to the \u201cLegislature\u201d of a\nState, many of which cannot possibly be read to mean \u201cthe people.\u201d\nSee Appendix,infra. Indeed, several provisions expressly\ndistinguish \u201cthe Legislature\u201d from \u201cthe People.\u201d See Art.\u00a0I,\n\u00a72; Amdt. 17. This Court has accordingly defined \u201cthe Legislature\u201d\nin the Elections Clause as \u201cthe representative bodywhich\nma[kes] the laws of the people.\u201dSmileyv.Holm, 285\nU.\u00a0S. 355, 365 (1932) (quotingHawkev.Smith (No.\n1), 253 U.\u00a0S. 221, 227 (1920) ; emphasis added).The majority largely ignores this evidence,\nrelying instead on disconnected observations about direct\ndemocracy, a contorted interpretation of an irrelevant statute, and\nnaked appeals to public policy. Nowhere does the majority explain\nhow a constitutional provision that vests redistricting authority\nin \u201cthe Legislature\u201d permits a State to wholly exclude \u201cthe\nLegislature\u201d from redistricting. Arizona\u2019s Commission might be a\nnoble endeavor\u2014although it does not seem so \u201cindependent\u201d in\npractice\u2014but the \u201cfact that a given law or procedure is efficient,\nconvenient, and useful .\u00a0.\u00a0. will not save it if it is\ncontrary to the Constitution.\u201dINSv.Chadha, 462\nU.\u00a0S. 919, 944 (1983) . No matter how concerned we may be\nabout partisanship in redistricting, this Court has no power to\ngerrymander the Constitution. I respectfully dissent.IThe majority begins by discussing policy. I\nbegin with the Constitution. The Elections Clause provides:\u201cThe Times, Places and Manner of holding\nElections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in\neach State by the Legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any\ntime by Law make or alter such Regulations, except as to the Places\nof chusing Senators.\u201d Art.\u00a0I, \u00a74, cl.\u00a01.The Elections Clause both imposes a duty on\nStates and assigns that duty to a particular state actor: In the\nabsence of a valid congressional directive to the contrary, States\nmust draw district lines for their federal representatives. And\nthat duty \u201cshall\u201d be carried out \u201cin each State by the Legislature\nthereof.\u201dIn Arizona, however, redistricting is not\ncarried out by the legislature. Instead, as the result of a ballot\ninitiative, an unelected body called the Independent Redistricting\nCommission draws the lines. Seeante, at 6\u20137. The key\nquestion in the case is whether the Commission can conduct\ncongressional districting consistent with the directive that such\nauthority be exercised \u201cby the Legislature.\u201dThe majority concedes that the unelected\nCommission is not \u201cthe Legislature\u201d of Arizona. The Court contends\ninstead that the people of Arizona as a whole constitute \u201cthe\nLegislature\u201d for purposes of the Elections Clause, and that they\nmay delegate the congressional districting authority conferred by\nthat Clause to the Commission.Ante, at 25. The majority\nprovides no support for the delegation part of its theory, and I am\nnot sure whether the major-ity\u2019s analysis is correct on that issue.\nBut even giving the Court the benefit of the doubt in that regard,\nthe Commission is still unconstitutional. Both the Constitution and\nour cases make clear that \u201cthe Legislature\u201d in the Elections Clause\nis the representative body which makes the laws of the people.AThe majority devotes much of its analysis to\nestablishing that the people of Arizona may exercise lawmaking\npower under their State Constitution. Seeante, at 5\u20136, 25,\n27\u201328. Nobody doubts that. This case is governed, however, by the\nFederal Constitution. The States do not, in the majority\u2019s words,\n\u201cretain autonomy to establish their own governmental processes,\u201dante, at 27, if those \u201cprocesses\u201d violate the United States\nConstitution. In a conflict between the Arizona Constitution and\nthe Elections Clause, the State Constitution must give way.\nArt.\u00a0VI, cl. 2;Cookv.Gralike, 531 U.\u00a0S.\n510, 523 (2001) . The majority opinion therefore largely misses the\npoint.The relevant question in this case is how to\ndefine \u201cthe Legislature\u201d under the Elections Clause. The majority\nopinion does not seriously turn to that question until page 24, and\neven then it fails to provide a coherent answer. The Court seems to\nconclude, based largely on its understanding of the \u201chistory and\npurpose\u201d of the Elections Clause,ante, at 24, that \u201cthe\nLegislature\u201d encompasses any entity in a State that exercises\nlegislative power. That circular definition lacks any basis in the\ntext of the Constitution or any other relevant legal source.The majority\u2019s textual analysis consists, in its\nentirety, of one paragraph citing founding era dictionaries. The\nmajority points to various dictionaries that follow Samuel\nJohnson\u2019s definition of \u201clegislature\u201d as the \u201cpower that makes\nlaws.\u201dIbid.(internal quotation marks omitted). The notion\nthat this definition corresponds to the entire population of a\nState is strained to begin with, and largely discredited by the\nmajority\u2019s own admission that \u201c[d]irect lawmaking by the people was\nvirtually unknown when the Constitution of 1787 was drafted.\u201dAnte, at 3 (internal quotation marks omitted); seeante, at 27. Moreover, Dr. Johnson\u2019s first example of the\nusage of \u201clegislature\u201d is this: \u201cWithout the concurrent consent of\nall three parts of the legislature, no law is or can be made.\u201d 2 A\nDictionary of the English Language (1st ed. 1755) (emphasis\ndeleted). Johnson borrowed that sentence from Matthew Hale, who\ndefined the \u201cThree Parts of the Legislature\u201d of England as the King\nand the two houses of Parliament. History of the Common Law of\nEngland 2 (1713). (The contrary notion that the people as a whole\nmake the laws would have cost you your head in England in 1713.)\nThus, even under the majority\u2019s preferred definition, \u201cthe\nLegislature\u201d referred to an institutional body of representatives,\nnot the people at large.Any ambiguity about the meaning of \u201cthe\nLegislature\u201d is removed by other founding era sources. \u201c[E]very\nstate constitution from the Founding Era that used the term\nlegislature defined it as a distinct multimember entity comprised\nof representatives.\u201d Morley, The Intratextual Independent\n\u201cLegislature\u201d and the Elections Clause, 109 Nw. U. L.\u00a0Rev.\nOnline 131, 147, and n. 101 (2015) (citing eleven State\nConstitutions). The Federalist Papers are replete with references\nto \u201clegislatures\u201d that can only be understood as referring to\nrepresentative institutions.E.g., The Federalist No. 27,\npp. 174\u2013175 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton) (describing \u201cthe\nState legislatures\u201d as \u201cselect bodies of men\u201d);id., No. 60,\nat 368 (contrasting \u201cthe State legislatures\u201d with \u201cthe people\u201d).\nNoah Webster\u2019s heralded American Dictionary of the English Language\ndefines \u201clegislature\u201d as \u201c[t]he body of men in a state or kingdom,\ninvested with power to make and repeal laws.\u201d 2 An American\nDictionary of the English Language (1828). It continues, \u201cThe\nlegislatures of most of the states in America .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nconsist of two houses or branches.\u201dIbid.(emphasis\ndeleted).I could go on, but the Court has said this\nbefore. As we put it nearly a century ago, \u201cLegislature\u201d was \u201cnot a\nterm of uncertain meaning when incorporated into the Constitution.\u201dHawke, 253 U.\u00a0S., at 227. \u201cWhat it meant when adopted\nit still means for the purpose of interpretation.\u201dIbid.\u201cA\nLegislature\u201d is \u201cthe representative body which ma[kes] the laws of\nthe people.\u201dIbid.; seeSmiley, 285 U.\u00a0S., at\n365 (relying on this definition);Colorado Gen. Assemblyv.Salazar, 541 U.\u00a0S. 1093, 1095 (2004) (Rehnquist,\nC.\u00a0J., dissenting from denial of certiorari) (same).BThe unambiguous meaning of \u201cthe Legislature\u201d\nin the Elections Clause as a representative body is confirmed by\nother provisions of the Constitution that use the same term in the\nsame way. When seeking to discern the meaning of a word in the\nConstitution, there is no better dictionary than the rest of the\nConstitution itself. Our precedents new and old have employed this\nstructural method of interpretation to read the Constitution in the\nmanner it was drafted and ratified\u2014as a unified, coherent whole.\nSee,e.g.,NLRBv.Noel Canning, 573\nU.\u00a0S. ___, ___\u2013___ (2014) (slip op., at 19\u201320);id., at\n___ (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 32);McCullochv.Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 414\u2013415 (1819);Martinv.Hunter\u2019s Lessee, 1 Wheat. 304, 328\u2013330\n(1816); Amar, Intratextualism, 112 Harv. L.\u00a0Rev. 747\n(1999).The Constitution includes seventeen provisions\nreferring to a State\u2019s \u201cLegislature.\u201d See Appendix,infra.\nEvery one of those references is consistent with the understanding\nof a legislature as a representative body. More importantly, many\nof them are only consistent with an institutional legislature\u2014and\nflatly incompatible with the majority\u2019s reading of \u201cthe\nLegislature\u201d to refer to the people as a whole.Start with the Constitution\u2019s first use of the\nterm: \u201cThe House of Representatives shall be composed of Members\nchosen every second Year by the People of the several States, and\nthe Electors in each State shall have the Qualifications requisite\nfor Electors of the most numerous Branch of the State Legislature.\u201d\nArt.\u00a0I, \u00a72, cl.\u00a01. This reference to a \u201cBranch of the\nState Legislature\u201d can only be referring to an institutional body,\nand the explicit juxtaposition of \u201cthe State Legislature\u201d with \u201cthe\nPeople of the several States\u201d forecloses the majority\u2019s proposed\nreading.The next Section of Article I describes how to\nfill vacancies in the United States Senate: \u201cif Vacancies happen by\nResignation, or otherwise, during the Recess of the Legislature of\nany State, the Executive thereof may make temporary Appointments\nuntil the next Meeting of the Legislature, which shall then fill\nsuch Vacancies.\u201d \u00a73, cl.\u00a02.[1] The references to \u201cthe Recess of the Legislature of any\nState\u201d and \u201cthe next Meeting of the Legislature\u201d are only\nconsistent with an institutional legislature, and make no sense\nunder the majority\u2019s reading. The people as a whole (schoolchildren\nand a few unnamed others excepted) do not take a \u201cRecess.\u201dThe list goes on. Article IV provides that the\n\u201cUnited States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a\nRepublican Form of Government, and shall protect each of them\nagainst Invasion; and on Application of the Legislature, or of the\nExecutive (when the Legislature cannot be convened), against\ndomestic Violence.\u201d \u00a74. It is perhaps conceivable that all the\npeople of a State could be \u201cconvened\u201d\u2014although this would seem\ndifficult during an \u201cInvasion\u201d or outbreak of \u201cdomestic\nViolence\u201d\u2014but the only natural reading of the Clause is that \u201cthe\nExecutive\u201d may submit a federal application when \u201cthe Legislature\u201d\nas a representative body cannot be convened.Article VI provides that the \u201cSenators and\nRepresentatives before mentioned, and the Members of the several\nState Legislatures, and all executive and judicial Officers, both\nof the United States and of the several States, shall be bound by\nOath or Affirmation, to support this Constitution.\u201d Cl.\u00a03.\nUnless the majority is prepared to make all the people of every\nState swear an \u201cOath or Affirmation, to support this Constitution,\u201d\nthis provision can only referto the \u201cseveral State Legislatures\u201d in\ntheir institutional capacity.Each of these provisions offers strong\nstructural indications about what \u201cthe Legislature\u201d must mean. But\nthe most powerful evidence of all comes from the Seventeenth\nAmendment. Under the original Constitution, Senators were \u201cchosen\nby the Legislature\u201d of each State, Art.\u00a0I, \u00a73, cl.\u00a01,\nwhile Members of the House of Representatives were chosen \u201cby the\nPeople,\u201d Art.\u00a0I, \u00a72, cl.\u00a01. That distinction was critical\nto the Framers. As James Madison explained, the Senate would\n\u201cderive its powers from the States,\u201d while the House would \u201cderive\nits powers from the people of America.\u201d The Federalist No. 39, at\n244. George Mason believed that the power of state legislatures to\nselect Senators would \u201cbe a reasonable guard\u201d against \u201cthe Danger\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. that the national, will swallow up the State\nLegislatures.\u201d 1 Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, p. 160\n(M. Farrand ed. 1911). Not everyone agreed. James Wilson proposed\nallowing the people to elect Senators directly. His proposal was\nrejected ten to one. Debates in the Federal Convention of 1787, S.\nDoc. No. 404, 57th Cong., 1st Sess., 8 (1902).Before long, reformers took up Wilson\u2019s mantle\nand launched a protracted campaign to amend the Constitution. That\neffort began in 1826, when Representative Henry Storrs of New York\nproposed\u2014but then set aside\u2014a constitutional amendment transferring\nthe power to elect Senators from the state legislatures to the\npeople. 2 Cong. Deb. 1348\u20131349. Over the next three-quarters of a\ncentury, no fewer than 188 joint resolutions proposing similar\nreforms were introduced in both Houses of Congress. 1 W. Hall, The\nHistory and Effect of the Seventeenth Amendment 183\u2013184 (1936).At no point in this process did anyone suggest\nthat a constitutional amendment was unnecessary because\n\u201cLegislature\u201d could simply be interpreted to mean \u201cpeople.\u201d SeeHawke, 253 U.\u00a0S., at 228 (\u201cIt was never suggested, so\nfar as we are aware, that the purpose of making the office of\nSenator elective by the people could be accomplished by a\nreferendum vote. The necessity of the amendment to accomplish the\npurpose of popular election is shown in the adoption of the\namendment.\u201d). In fact, as the decades rolled by without an\namendment, 28 of the 45 States settled for the next best thing by\nholding a popular vote on candidates for Senate, then pressuring\nstate legislators into choosing the winner. See,e.g.,Abstract of Laws Relating to the Election of United States\nSenators, S. Doc. No. 393, 59th Cong., 2d Sess. (1907). All agreed\nthat cutting the state legislature out of senatorial selection\nentirely would require nothing less than to \u201cStrike out\u201d the\noriginal words in the Constitution and \u201cinsert, \u2018elected by the\npeople\u2019\u00a0\u201d in its place. Cong. Globe, 31st Cong., 1st Sess., 88\n(1849) (proposal of Sen. Jeremiah Clemens).Yet that is precisely what the majority does to\nthe Elections Clause today\u2014amending the text not through the\nprocess provided by Article V, but by judicial decision. The\nmajority\u2019s revision renders the Seventeenth Amendment an 86-year\nwaste of time, and singles out the Elections Clause as the only one\nof the Constitution\u2019s seventeen provisions referring to \u201cthe\nLegislature\u201d that departs from the ordinary meaning of the\nterm.The Commission had no answer to this point. See\nTr. of Oral Arg. 42 (Justice Alito: \u201cIs there any other provision\nwhere legislature means anything other than the conventional\nmeaning?\u201d Appellee: \u201cI don\u2019t know the answer to that\nquestion.\u201d).The Court\u2019s response is not much better. The\nmajority observes that \u201cthe Legislature\u201d of a State may perform\ndifferent functions under different provisions of the Constitution.\nUnder Article I, \u00a73, for example, \u201cthe Legislature\u201d performed an\n\u201celectoral\u201d function by choosing Senators. The \u201cLegislature\u201d plays\na \u201cconsenting\u201d function under Article I, \u00a78, and Article IV, \u00a73; a\n\u201cratifying\u201d function under Article V; and a \u201clawmaking\u201d function\nunder the Elections Clause.Ante, at 19, and n.\u00a017. All\ntrue. The majority, however, leaps from the premise that \u201cthe\nLegislature\u201d performs differentfunctionsunder different\nprovisions to the conclusion that \u201cthe Legislature\u201d assumes\ndifferentidentitiesunder different provisions.As a matter of ordinary language and common\nsense, however, a difference in function does not imply a\ndifference in meaning. A car, for example, generally serves a\ntransportation function. But it can also fulfill a storage\nfunction. At a tailgate party or a drive-in movie, it may play an\nentertainment function. In the absence of vacancies at the roadside\nmotel, it could provide a lodging function. To a neighbor with a\ndead battery, it offers an electricity generation function. And\nyet, a person describing a \u201ccar\u201d engaged in any of these varied\nfunctions would undoubtedly be referring to the same thing.The Constitution itself confirms this point.\nArticles I and II assign many different functions to the Senate: a\nlawmaking function, an impeachment trial function, a treaty\nratification function, an appointee confirmation function, an\nofficer selection function, a qualification judging function, and a\nrecordkeeping function. Art.\u00a0I, \u00a71; \u00a73, cls. 5, 6; \u00a75,\ncls.\u00a01, 3; \u00a77, cl. 2; Art.\u00a0II, \u00a72, cl.\u00a02. Yet the\nidentity of the Senate remains the same as it discharges these\nvarious functions.Similarly, the House of Representatives performs\ndifferent functions, including lawmaking, impeachment, and\nresolving Presidential elections in which no candidate wins a\nmajority in the Electoral College. Art.\u00a0I, \u00a71; \u00a72, cl.\u00a05;\n\u00a77, cl.\u00a02; Amdt. 12. The President is assigned not only\nexecutive functions, Art.\u00a0II, but also legislative functions,\nsuch as approving or vetoing bills, convening both Houses of\nCongress, and recommending measures for their consideration,\nArt.\u00a0I, \u00a77, cl. 2; Art.\u00a0II, \u00a73. Courts not only exercise\na judicial function, Art.\u00a0III, \u00a71, but may also perform an\nappointment function, Art.\u00a0II, \u00a72, cl.\u00a02. And so on.\nNeither the majority nor the Commission points to a single instance\nin which the identity of these actors changes as they exercise\ndifferent functions.The majority attempts to draw support from\nprecedent, but our cases only further undermine its position. InHawke, this Court considered the meaning of \u201cthe\nLegislatur[e]\u201d in Article V, which outlines the process for\nratifying constitutional amendments. The Court concluded that\n\u201cLegislature\u201d meant \u201cthe representative body which ma[kes] the laws\nof the people.\u201d 253 U.\u00a0S., at 227. The Court then explained\nthat \u201c[t]he term is often used in the Constitutionwith this\nevident meaning.\u201dIbid.(emphasis added). The Court\nproceeded to list other constitutional provisions that assign\ndifferent functions to the \u201cLegislature,\u201d just as the majority does\ntoday.Id., at 227\u2013228; seeante, at 19,\nn.\u00a017.Unlike the majority today, however, the Court inHawkenever hinted that the meaning of \u201cLegislature\u201d varied\nacross those different provisions because they assigned different\nfunctions. To the contrary, the Court drew inferences from the\nSeventeenth Amendment and its predecessor, Article I, \u00a73\u2014in which\n\u201cthe Legislature\u201d played anelectoralfunction\u2014to define the\n\u201cLegislature\u201d in Article V, which assigned it aratificationfunction. See 253 U.\u00a0S., at 228. The Court concluded that\n\u201cLegislature\u201d refers to a representative body, whatever its\nfunction. As the Court put it, \u201cThere can be no question that the\nframers of the Constitution clearly understood and carefully used\nthe terms in which that instrument referred to the action of the\nlegislatures of the States. When they intended that direct action\nby the people should be had they were no less accurate in the use\nof apt phraseology to carry out such purpose.\u201dIbid.(citing\nArt.\u00a0I, \u00a72).Smiley, the leading precedent on the\nmeaning of \u201cthe Legislature\u201d in the Elections Clause, reaffirmed\nthe definition announced inHawke. InSmiley, the\npetitioner argued\u2014as the Commission does here\u2014that \u201cthe\nLegislature\u201d referred not just to \u201cthe two houses of the\nlegislature\u201d but to \u201cthe entire legislative power of the state\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. however exercised.\u201d Brief for Petitioner,\nO.\u00a0T. 1931, No. 617, p.\u00a022 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). The Court did not respond by holding, as the majority\ntoday suggests, that \u201c\u00a0\u2018the Legislature\u2019 comprises the\nreferendum and the Governor\u2019s veto in the context of regulating\ncongressional elections,\u201d or that \u201c\u00a0\u2018the Legislature\u2019 has a\ndifferent iden-tity\u201d in the Elections Clause than it does in\nArticle V.Ante,at 18\u201319. Instead, the Court inSmileysaid this:\u201cMuch that is urged in argument with\nregard to the meaning of the term \u2018Legislature\u2019 is beside the\npoint. As this Court said inHawke.\u00a0.\u00a0. the term\nwas not one \u2018of uncertain meaning when incorporated into the\nConstitution. What it meant when adopted it still means for\npurposes of interpretation. A Legislature was then the\nrepresentative body which made the laws of the people.\u2019\u00a0\u201d 285\nU.\u00a0S., at 365 (quotingHawke, 253 U.\u00a0S., at\n227).Remarkably, the majority refuses to even\nacknowledge the definition of \u201cthe Legislature\u201d adopted in bothSmileyandHawke, and instead embraces the\ninterpretation that this Court unanimously rejected more than 80\nyears ago.[2]CThe history of the Elections Clause further\nsupports the conclusion that \u201cthe Legislature\u201d is a representative\nbody. The first known draft of the Clause to appear at the\nConstitutional Convention provided that \u201cEach state shall prescribe\nthe time and manner of holding elections.\u201d 1 Debates on the Federal\nConstitution 146 (J. Elliot ed. 1836). After revision by the\nCommittee of Detail, the Clause included the important limitation\nat issue here: \u201cThe times and places, and the manner, of holding\nthe elections of the members of each house, shall be prescribedby the legislature of each state; but their provisions\nconcerning them may, at any time, be alteredby the legislature\nof the United States.\u201dId.,at 225 (emphasis added). The\ninsertion of \u201cthe legislature\u201d indicates that the Framers thought\ncarefully about which entity within the State was to perform\ncongressional districting. And the parallel between \u201cthe\nlegislature of each state\u201d and \u201cthe legislature of the United\nStates\u201d further suggests that they meant \u201cthe legislature\u201d as a\nrepresentative body.As the majority explains, the debate over the\nratification of the Elections Clause centered on its second part,\nwhich empowers Congress to \u201cmake or alter\u201d regulations prescribed\nby \u201cthe Legislature\u201d of a State. Seeante, at 25\u201327.\nImportantly for our purposes, however, both sides in this debate\n\u201crecognized the distinction between the state legislature and the\npeople themselves.\u201dBrownv.Secretary of State of\nFlorida, 668 F.\u00a03d 1271, 1275\u20131276, n.\u00a04 (CA11\n2012).The Anti-Federalists, for example, supported\nvesting election regulation power solely in state legislatures\nbecause state \u201clegislatures were more numerousbodies,\nusuallyelected annually, and thus more likely to be in\nsympathy with the interestsof the people.\u201d Natelson, The\nOriginal Scope of the Congressional Power to Regulate Elections, 13\nU. Pa. J. Const. L. 1, 31 (2010) (emphasis added) (citing sources\nfrom ratification debates). Alexander Hamilton and others responded\nby raising the specter of state legislatures\u2014which he described as\n\u201clocal administrations\u201d\u2014deciding to \u201cannihilate\u201d the Federal\nGovernment by \u201cneglecting to provide for the choice of persons to\nadminister its affairs.\u201d The Federalist No. 59, at 363. As the\nmajority acknowledges, the distinction between \u201cthe Legislature\u201d\nand the people \u201coccasioned no debate.\u201dAnte, at 27. That is\nbecause everybody understood what \u201cthe Legislature\u201d meant.The majority contends that its counterintuitive\nreading of \u201cthe Legislature\u201d is necessary to advance the \u201canimating\nprinciple\u201d of popular sovereignty.Ante, at 24. But the\nratification of the Constitution was the ultimate act of popular\nsovereignty, and the people who ratified the Elections Clause did\nso knowing that it assigned authority to \u201cthe Legislature\u201d as a\nrepresentative body. The Elections Clause was not, as the majority\nsuggests, an all-purpose \u201csafeguard against manipulation of\nelectoral rules by politicians.\u201dAnte, at 26. Like most\nprovisions of the Constitution, the Elections Clause reflected a\ncompromise\u2014a pragmatic recognition that the grand project of\nforging a Union required everyone to accept some things they did\nnot like. See The Federalist No. 59, at 364 (describing the power\nallocated to state legislatures as \u201can evil which could not have\nbeen avoided\u201d). This Court has no power to upset such a compromise\nsimply because we now think that it should have been struck\ndifferently. As we explained almost a century ago, \u201c[t]he framers\nof the Constitution might have adopted a different method,\u201d but it\n\u201cis not the function of courts .\u00a0.\u00a0. to alter the method\nwhich the Constitution has fixed.\u201dHawke, 253 U.\u00a0S., at\n227.DIn addition to text, structure, and history,\nseveral precedents interpreting the Elections Clause further\nreinforce that \u201cthe Legislature\u201d refers to a representative\nbody.The first precedent comes not from this Court,\nbut from Congress. Acting under its authority to serve as \u201cthe\nJudge of the Elections, Returns and Qualifications of its own\nMembers,\u201d Art.\u00a0I, \u00a75, cl.\u00a01, the House of Representatives\nin 1866 confronted a dispute about who should be seated as the\nCongressman from the Fifth District of Michigan. At a popular\nconvention, Michigan voters had amended the State Constitution to\nrequire votes to be cast within a resident\u2019s township or ward. The\nMichigan Legislature, however, passed a law permitting soldiers to\nvote in alternative locations. If only the local votes counted, one\ncandidate (Baldwin) would win; if the outside votes were included,\nthe other candidate (Trowbridge) would be entitled to the seat. SeeBaldwinv.Trowbridge, 2 Bartlett Contested Election\nCases, H.\u00a0R. Misc. Doc. No. 152, 41st Cong., 2d Sess., 46\u201347\n(1866).The House Elections Committee explained that the\nElections Clause conferred power on \u201cthe Legislature\u201d of Michigan\nto prescribe election regulations. \u201cBut,\u201d the Committee asked,\n\u201cwhat is meant by \u2018the legislature?\u2019 Does it mean the legislative\npower of the State, which would include a convention authorized to\nprescribe fundamental law; or does it mean the legislatureeo\nnomine, as known in the political history of the country?\u201dId.,at 47. The Committee decided, and the full House\nagreed, that \u201cthe Legislature\u201d in the Elections Clause was the\n\u201clegislatureeo nomine\u201d\u2014the legislatureby that name,\na representative body.Ibid.That conclusion followed both\nfrom the known meaning of \u201cthe Legislature\u201d at the time of the\nframing and the many other uses of the word in the Constitution\nthat would not be compatible with a popular convention. Thus,\n\u201c[w]here there is a conflict of authority between the constitution\nand legislature of a State in regard to fixing place of elections,\nthe power of the legislature is paramount.\u201dId.,at 46; seeCalifornia Democratic Partyv.Jones, 530 U.\u00a0S.\n567 , and n. 11 (2000) (Stevens, J., dissenting) (relying onBaldwinfor its conclusion that \u201cthe Elections Clause\u2019s\nspecific reference to \u2018the Legislature\u2019 is not so broad as to\nencompass the general \u2018legislative power of this\nState\u2019\u00a0\u201d).The majority draws attention to the minority\nreport inBaldwin.Ante, at 29. Under the present\ncircumstances, I take some comfort in the Court\u2019s willingness to\nconsider dissenting views. Still, the minority report does not\ndiminish the force ofBaldwin. The report cites a Michigan\nSupreme Court precedent that allegedly reached a con-trary result,\nbut that case turned entirely on state constitu-tional questions\narising from a state election\u2014not federal constitutional questions\narising from a federal election. SeePeople ex\u00a0rel.\nTwitchellv.Blodgett, 13 Mich. 127 (1865). The majority\nalso contends thatBaldwin\u201cappears in tension with\u201d an\nearlier House Elections Committee precedent.Ante, at 29. By\nits own terms, however, that earlier precedent did not involve a\nconflict between a state legislative act and a state constitutional\nprovision. SeeShielv.Thayer, 1 Bartlett Contested\nElection Cases, H.\u00a0R. Misc. Doc. No. 57, 38th Cong., 2d Sess.,\n350 (1861) (\u201cthe two branches of the legislature differed upon the\nquestion .\u00a0.\u00a0. and so the bill never became a law\u201d). In\nany event, to the degree that the two precedents are inconsistent,\nthe later decision inBaldwinshould govern.[3]The next relevant precedent is this Court\u2019s\ndecision inMcPhersonv.Blacker, 146 U.\u00a0S. 1\n(1892) . That case involved a constitutional provision with\nconsiderable similarity to the Elections Clause, the Presidential\nElectors Clause of Article II: \u201cEach State shall appoint, in such\nManneras the Legislature thereofmay direct, a Number of\nElectors .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d \u00a71, cl.\u00a02 (emphasis added).\nThe question was whether the state legislature, as a body of\nrepresentatives, could divide authority to appoint electors across\neach of the State\u2019s congressional districts. The Court upheld the\nlaw and emphasized that the plain text of the Presidential Electors\nClause vests the power to determine the manner of appointment in\n\u201cthe Legislature\u201d of the State. That power, the Court explained,\n\u201ccan neither be taken away nor abdicated.\u201d 146 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 35 (emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted).Against that backdrop, the Court decided two\ncases regarding the meaning of \u201cthe Legislature\u201d in the Elections\nClause. InOhio ex rel. Davisv.Hildebrant, 241\nU.\u00a0S. 565 (1916) , the Ohio Legislature passed a congressional\nredistricting law. Under the Ohio Constitution, voters held a\nreferendum on the law and rejected it. A supporter of the law sued\non behalf of the State, contending that the referendum \u201cwas not and\ncould not be a part of the legislative authority of the State and\ntherefore could have no influence on .\u00a0.\u00a0. the law\ncreating congressional districts\u201d under the Elections Clause.Id.,at 567.This Court rejected the challenger\u2019s\nconstitutional argument as a nonjusticiable claim that the\nreferendum \u201ccauses a State .\u00a0.\u00a0. to be not republican\u201d in\nviolation of the Guarantee Clause of the Constitution.Id.,at 569 (citing Art. IV, \u00a74). The Court also rejected an argument\nthat Ohio\u2019s use of the referendum violated a federal statute, and\nheld that Congress had the power to pass that statute under the\nElections Clause.Id.,at 568\u2013569.Hildebrantin no\nway suggested that the state legislature could be displaced from\nthe redistricting process, andHildebrantcertainly did not\nhold\u2014as the majority today contends\u2014that \u201cthe word [\u2018Legislature\u2019\nin the Elections Clause] encompassed a veto power lodged in the\npeople.\u201dAnte, at 16.Hildebrantsimply approved a\nState\u2019s decision to employ a referendumin addition toredistricting by the Legislature. See 241 U.\u00a0S., at 569. The\nresult of the decision was to sendthe Ohio Legislatureback\nto the drawing board to do the redistricting.InSmiley, the Minnesota Legislature\npassed a law adopting new congressional districts, and the Governor\nexercised his veto power under the State Constitution. As noted\nabove, the Minnesota secretary of state defended the veto on the\nground that \u201cthe Legislature\u201d in the Elections Clause referred not\njust to \u201cthe two houses of the legislature\u201d but to \u201cthe entire\nlegislative power of the state .\u00a0.\u00a0. however exercised.\u201d\nThis Court rejected that argument, reiterating that the term\n\u201cLegislature\u201d meant \u201cthe representative body which made the laws of\nthe people.\u201d 285 U.\u00a0S., at 365 (quotingHawke, 253\nU.\u00a0S., at 227). The Court nevertheless went on to hold that\nthe Elections Clause did not prevent a State from applying the\nusual rules of its legislative process\u2014including a gubernatorial\nveto\u2014to election regulations prescribed by the legislature. 285\nU.\u00a0S., at 373. As inHildebrant, the legislature was\nnot displaced, nor was it redefined; it just had to start on a new\nredistricting plan.The majority initially describesHildebrantandSmileyas holding that \u201credistricting\nis a legislative function, to be performed in accordance with the\nState\u2019s prescriptions for lawmaking, which may include the\nreferendum and the Governor\u2019s veto.\u201dAnte, at 19. That\ndescription is true, so far as it goes. But it hardly supports the\nresult the majority reaches here. There is a critical difference\nbetween allowing a State tosupplementthe legislature\u2019s\nrole in the legislative process and permitting the State tosupplantthe legislature altogether. SeeSalazar, 541\nU.\u00a0S., at 1095 (Rehnquist, C.\u00a0J., dissenting from denial\nof certiorari) (\u201cto be consistent with Article I, \u00a74, there must be\nsome limit on the State\u2019s ability to define lawmaking by excluding\nthe legislature itself\u201d). Nothing inHildebrant,Smiley, or any other precedent supports the majority\u2019s\nconclusion that imposing some constraints on the legislature\njustifies deposing it entirely.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*The constitutional text, structure, history,\nand precedent establish a straightforward rule: Under the Elections\nClause, \u201cthe Legislature\u201d is a representative body that, when it\nprescribes election regulations, may be required to do so within\nthe ordinary lawmaking process, but may not be cut out of that\nprocess. Put simply, the state legislature need not be exclusive in\ncongressional districting, but neither may it be excluded.The majority\u2019s contrary understanding requires\nit to accept a definition of \u201cthe Legislature\u201d that contradicts the\nterm\u2019s plain meaning, creates discord with the Seventeenth\nAmendment and the Constitution\u2019s many other uses of the term, makes\nnonsense of the drafting and ratification of the Elections Clause,\nand breaks with the relevant precedents. In short, the effect of\nthe majority\u2019s decision is to erase the words \u201cby the Legislature\nthereof\u201d from the Elections Clause. That is a judicial error of the\nmost basic order. \u201cIt cannot be presumed that any clause in the\nconstitution is intended to be without effect; and therefore such a\nconstruction is inadmissible.\u201dMarburyv.Madison, 1\nCranch 137, 174 (1803).IIThe Court also issues an alternative holding\nthat a federal statute, 2 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72a(c), permits\nArizona to vest redistricting authority in the Commission.Ante,at 19\u201323. The majority does not contend that this\nstatutory holding resolves the constitutional question presented,\nseeante, at 23, so its reading of Section 2a(c) is largely\nbeside the point. With respect, its statutory argument is also hard\nto take seriously. Section 2a(c) does not apply to this case. And\neven if it did, it would likely be unconstitutional.[4]ASection 2a(c) establishes a number of default\nrules that govern the States\u2019 manner of electing representatives\n\u201c[u]ntil a State is redistricted in the manner provided by the law\nthereof.\u201d Section 2a(c) is therefore \u201cinapplicableunlessthe state legislature, and state and federal courts, have all\nfailed to redistrict\u201d the State.Branchv.Smith, 538\nU.\u00a0S. 254, 275 (2003) (plurality opinion); seeid., at\n298\u2013300 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).\nHere, the Commissionhasredistricted the State \u201cin the\nmanner provided by the law thereof.\u201d So by its terms, Section 2a(c)\ndoes not come into play in this case.The majority spends several pages discussing\nSection 2a(c), but it conspicuously declines to say that the\nstatute actually applies to this case.[5] The majority notes that the pre-1911 versions of\nSection 2a(c) applied only until \u201cthe legislature\u201d redistricted the\nState, while the post-1911 versions applied only until the State is\nredistricted \u201cin the manner provided by the law thereof.\u201d The\nmajority also describes in detail the legislative history that\naccompanied the 1911 amendment. But if Section 2a(c) does not\napply, its legislative history is doubly irrelevant.The majority seems to suggest that Section 2a(c)\nsomehow indicates federal approval for the district lines that the\nCommission has drawn. Seeante, at 23. But the statute does\nnothing of the sort. Section 2a(c) explains what rules apply\n\u201c[u]ntil a State is redistricted\u201d; it says nothing about what rules\napplyaftera State is redis-tricted. And it certainly does\nnot say that the State\u2019s redistricting plan will by some alchemy\nbecome federal law. No legislative drafter remotely familiar with\nthe English language would say that a State had to follow default\nrules \u201c[u]ntil [it] is redistricted in the manner provided by the\nlaw thereof,\u201d when what he meant was \u201cany redistricting plan that\nthe State adopts shall become federal law.\u201d And if the drafter was\ndoing something as significant as transforming state law into\nfederal law, he presumably would have taken care to make that\ndramatic step \u201cunmistakably clear.\u201dGregoryv.Ashcroft, 501 U.\u00a0S. 452, 460 (1991) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). Tellingly, our most recent case on the meaning of\nSection 2a(c) seems not to have even considered the majority\u2019s\nposition. SeeBranch, 538 U.\u00a0S. 254 .Indeed, the majority does not even seem\npersuaded by its own argument. The majority quickly cautions, in\ndiscussing Section 2a(c), that \u201ca State is required to comply with\nthe Federal Constitution, the Voting Rights Act, and other federal\nlaws when it draws and implements its district map.\u201dAnte,\nat 22, n.\u00a020. The majority therefore concludes that \u201cnothing\nin \u00a72a(c) affects a challenge to a state district map on the ground\nthat it violates one or more of those federal requirements.\u201dIbid.But here the Arizona Legislature has challenged \u201ca\nstate district map on the ground that it violates one\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. of those federal requirements\u201d\u2014the Elections\nClause. If we take the majority at its word, nothing in Section\n2a(c) should affect that challenge.BNot only is the majority\u2019s reading of Section\n2a(c) implausible as a matter of statutory interpretation, it would\nalso likely violate the Constitution in multiple ways.First, the majority\u2019s reading of Section 2a(c)\nas a statute approving the lines drawn by the Commission would\nseemingly authorize Congress to alter the Elections Clause. The\nfirst part of the Elections Clause gives state legislatures the\npower to prescribe regulations regarding the times, places, and\nmanner of elections; the second part of the Clause gives Congress\nthe power to \u201cmake or alter such Regulations.\u201d There is a\ndifference between making or altering election regulations\nprescribed by the state legislature and authorizing an entityother than the state legislatureto prescribe election\nregulations. In essence, the majority\u2019s proposed reading permits\nCongress to use the second part of the Elections Clause to nullify\nthe first. Yet this Court has expressly held that \u201cCongress ha[s]\nno power to alter Article I, section 4 [the Elections Clause].\u201dSmiley, 285 U.\u00a0S., at 372; see alsoClintonv.City of New York, 524 U.\u00a0S. 417 (1998) (Congress may\nnot circumvent Article I constraints on its lawmaking power);Chadha, 462 U.\u00a0S. 919 (same).Second, the majority\u2019s interpretation of Section\n2a(c) would create a serious delegation problem. As a general\nmatter, Congress may pass statutes that delegate some discretion to\nthose who administer the laws. It is a well-accepted principle,\nhowever, that Congress may not delegate authority to one actor when\nthe Constitution vests that authority in another actor. SeeWhitmanv.American Trucking Assns., Inc., 531\nU.\u00a0S. 457, 472 (2001) . The majority\u2019s reading of Section\n2a(c) contradicts that rule by allowing Congress to delegate\nfederal redistricting authority to a state entity other than the\none in which the Elections Clause vests that authority: \u201cthe\nLegislature.\u201dThird, the majority\u2019s interpretation conflicts\nwith our most recent Elections Clause precedent,Arizonav.Inter Tribal Council of Ariz., Inc., 570 U.\u00a0S. 1 (2013)\n. There we explained that when Congress legislates under the\nElections Clause, it \u201cnecessarilydisplaces some element of\na pre-existing legal regime erected by the States.\u201dId., at\n___ (slip op., at 11). That is so because \u201cthe power the Elections\nClause confers [on Congress] is none other than the power to\npre-empt.\u201dId., at ___\u2013___, (slip op., at 11\u201312). Put\ndifferently, \u201callaction under the Elections Clause\ndisplaces some element of a pre-existing state regulatory regime,\nbecause the text of the Clause confers the power to do exactly (and\nonly) that.\u201dId., at ___, n.\u00a06 (slip op., at 11, n. 6).\nUnder the majority\u2019s interpretation of Section 2a(c), however,\nCongress has done the opposite of preempting or displacing state\nlaw\u2014it hasadoptedstate law.Normally, when \u201ca serious doubt of\nconstitutionality is raised, it is a cardinal principle that this\nCourt will first ascertain whether a construction of the statute is\nfairly possible by which the question may be avoided.\u201dCrowellv.Benson, 285 U.\u00a0S. 22, 62 (1932) . The\nmultiple serious constitutional doubts raised by the majority\u2019s\ninterpretation of Section 2a(c)\u2014in addition to the sheer weakness\nof its reading as a textual matter\u2014provide more than enough reason\nto reject the majority\u2019s construction. Section 2a(c) does not apply\nto this case.IIIJustice Jackson once wrote that the\nConstitution speaks in \u201cmajestic generalities.\u201dWest Virginia\nBd. of Ed. v.Barnette,319 U.\u00a0S. 624, 639 (1943) .\nIn many places it does, and so we have cases expounding on \u201cfreedom\nof speech\u201d and \u201cunreasonable searches and seizures.\u201d Amdts. 1, 4.\nYet the Constitution also speaks in some places with elegant\nspecificity. A Member of the House of Representatives must be 25\nyears old. Art.\u00a0I, \u00a72, cl.\u00a02. Every State gets two\nSenators. Art.\u00a0I, \u00a73, cl.\u00a01. And the times, places, and\nmanner of holding elections for those federal representatives\n\u201cshall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof.\u201d\nArt.\u00a0I, \u00a74, cl.\u00a01.For the reasons I have explained, there is no\nreal doubt about what \u201cthe Legislature\u201d means. The Framers of the\nConstitution were \u201cpractical men, dealing with the facts of\npolitical life as they understood them, putting into form the\ngovernment they were creating, and prescribing in language clear\nand intelligible the powers that government was to take.\u201dSouth\nCarolinav.United States, 199 U.\u00a0S. 437, 449\n(1905). We ought to give effect to the words they used.The majority today shows greater concern about\nredistricting practices than about the meaning of the Constitution.\nI recognize the difficulties that arise from trying to fashion\njudicial relief for partisan gerrymandering. SeeViethv.Jubelirer, 541 U.\u00a0S. 267 (2004) ;ante, at 1.\nBut our inability to find a manageable standard in that area is no\nexcuse to abandon a standard of meaningful interpretation in this\narea. This Court has stressed repeatedly that a law\u2019s virtues as a\npolicy innovation cannot redeem its inconsistency with the\nConstitution. \u201cFailure of political will does not justify\nunconstitutional remedies.\u201dClinton, 524 U.\u00a0S., at 449\n(Kennedy, J., concurring); seeSternv.Marshall, 564\nU.\u00a0S. ___ (2011);Free Enterprise Fundv.Public\nCompany Accounting Oversight Bd., 561 U.\u00a0S. 477 (2010) ;Bowsherv.Synar, 478 U.\u00a0S. 714 (1986) ;Chadha, 462 U.\u00a0S. 919 ;Myersv.United\nStates, 272 U.\u00a0S. 52 (1926) .Indeed, the Court has enforced the text of the\nConstitution to invalidate state laws with policy objectives\nreminiscent of this one. Two of our precedents held that States\ncould not use their constitutions to impose term limits on their\nfederal representatives in violation of the United States\nConstitution.Cook, 531 U.\u00a0S. 510 ;U.\u00a0S. Term\nLimits, Inc.v.Thornton, 514 U.\u00a0S. 779 (1995) .\nThe people of the States that enacted these reforms surely viewed\nthem as measures that would \u201cplace the lead rein in the people\u2019s\nhands.\u201dAnte, at 27. Yet the Court refused to accept \u201cthat\nthe Framers spent significant time and energy in debating and\ncrafting Clauses that could be easily evaded.\u201dTerm Limits,\n514 U.\u00a0S., at 831. The majority approves just such an evasion\nof the Constitution today.[6]The Court also overstates the effects of\nenforcing the plain meaning of the Constitution in this case. There\nis no dispute that Arizona may continue to use its Commission to\ndraw lines for state legislative elections. The representatives\nchosen in those elections will then be responsible for\ncongressional redistricting as members of the state legislature, so\nthe work of the Commission will continue to influence Arizona\u2019s\nfederal representation.Moreover, reading the Elections Clause to\nrequire the involvement of the legislature will not affect most\nother redistricting commissions. As the majority notes, many States\nhave commissions that play an \u201cauxiliary role\u201d in congressional\nredistricting.Ante, at 8, and nn. 8\u20139. But in these States,\nunlike in Arizona, the legislature retains primary authority over\ncongressional redistricting. See Brief for National Conference of\nState Legislatures asAmicus Curiae3\u201317.The majority also points to a scattered array of\nelection-related laws and constitutional provisions enacted via\npopular lawmaking that it claims would be \u201cendangered\u201d by\ninterpreting the Elections Clause to mean what it says.Ante, at 33. Reviewing the constitutionality of these\nfarflung provisions is well outside the scope of this case. Suffice\nit to say that none of them purports to do what the Arizona\nConstitution does here: set up an unelected, unaccountable\ninstitution that permanently and totally displaces the legislature\nfrom the redistricting process. \u201c[T]his wolf comes as a wolf.\u201dMorrisonv.Olson, 487 U.\u00a0S. 654, 699 (1988)\n(Scalia, J., dissenting).Absent from the majority\u2019s portrayal of the high\nmotives that inspired the Arizona Commission is any discussion of\nhow it has actually functioned. The facts described in a recent\nopinion by a three-judge District Court detail the partisanship\nthat has affected the Commission on issues ranging from staffing\ndecisions to drawing the district lines. SeeHarrisv.Arizona Independent Redistricting Comm\u2019n, 993 F.\u00a0Supp.\n2d 1042 (Ariz. 2014). Theper curiamopinion explained that\n\u201cpartisanship played some rolein the design of the map,\u201d that \u201csome\nof the commissioners were motivated in part in some of the\nlinedrawing decisions by a desire to improve Democratic prospects\nin the affected districts,\u201d and that the Commission retained a\nmapping consultant that \u201chad worked for Democratic, independent,\nand nonpartisan campaigns, but no Republican campaigns.\u201dId., at 1046, 1047, 1053. The hiring of the mapping\nconsultant provoked sufficient controversy that the Governor of\nArizona, supported by two-thirds of the Arizona Senate, attempted\nto remove the chairwoman of the Commission for \u201csubstantial neglect\nof duty and gross misconduct in office.\u201dId., at 1057; seeArizonaIndependent Redistricting Comm\u2019nv.Brewer, 229 Ariz. 347, 275 P.\u00a03d 1267 (2012)\n(explaining the removal and concluding that the Governor exceeded\nher authority under the Arizona Constitution).Judge Silver\u2019s separate opinion noted that \u201cthe\nvery structure of Arizona\u2019s reformed redistricting process reflects\nthat partisanship still plays a prominent role.\u201d 993 F.\u00a0Supp.\n2d, at 1083. Judge Wake\u2019s separate opinion described the\nCommission\u2019s \u201csystematic overpopulation of Republican plurality\ndistricts and underpopulation of Democratic plurality districts\u201d as\n\u201cold-fashioned partisan malapportionment.\u201dId., at 1091,\n1108. In his words, the \u201cCommission has been coin-clipping the\ncurrency of our democracy\u2014everyone\u2019s equal vote\u2014and giving all the\nshavings to one party, for no valid reason.\u201dId., at\n1092.The District Court concluded by a two-to-one\nmargin that this partisanship did not rise to the level of a\nconstitutional violation. The case is pending on appeal before this\nCourt, and I take no position on the merits question. But a finding\nthat the partisanship in the redistricting plan did not violate the\nConstitution hardly proves that the Commission is operating free of\npartisan influence\u2014and certainly not that it complies with the\nElections Clause.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*The people of Arizona have concerns about the\nprocess of congressional redistricting in their State. For better\nor worse, the Elections Clause of the Constitution does not allow\nthem to address those concerns by displacing their legislature. But\nit does allow them to seek relief from Congress, which can make or\nalter the regulations prescribed by the legislature. And the\nConstitution gives them another means of change. They can follow\nthe lead of the reformers who won passage of the Seventeenth\nAmendment. Indeed, several constitutional amendments over the past\ncentury have involved modifications of the electoral process.\nAmdts. 19, 22, 24, 26. Unfortunately, today\u2019s decision will only\ndiscourage this democratic method of change. Why go through the\nhassle of writing a new provision into the Constitution when it is\nso much easier to write an old one out?I respectfully dissent.APPENDIX:\u201cLEGISLATURE\u201d IN THE CONSTITUTIONArt.

Seeante, at 18. And\neven that selected snippet describes the \u201clegislature\u201d as a \u201cbody.\u201d\n286 U.\u00a0S., at 434.3The majority\u2019s suggestion\nthatBaldwinshould be dismissed as an act of partisanship\nappears to have no basis, unless one is willing to regard as\ntainted every decision in favor of a candidate from the same party\nas a majority of the Elections Committee.Ante, at\n29\u201330.4Not surprisingly, Section\n2a(c) was barely raised below and was not addressed by the District\nCourt. Seeante, at 19, n.\u00a018.5The majority is prepared\nto say that Section 2a(c) has more than \u201cnothing to do with this\ncase.\u201dAnte, at 23, n. 22. Not exactly a ringing\nendorsement.6Term Limitswas of\ncourse not decided on the abstract principle that \u201cthe people\nshould choose whom they please to govern them.\u201dAnte, at 27,\nn. 24 (quoting 514 U.\u00a0S., at 783). If that were the rule, the\npeople could choose a 20-year-old Congressman, a 25-year-old\nSenator, or a foreign President. But see Art.\u00a0I, \u00a72,\ncl.\u00a02; \u00a73, cl.\u00a03; Art.\u00a0II, \u00a71, cl.\u00a05.Term\nLimitsinstead relied on analysis of the text, structure, and\nhistory of the Constitution\u2014all factors that cut strongly against\nthe majority\u2019s position today.",
