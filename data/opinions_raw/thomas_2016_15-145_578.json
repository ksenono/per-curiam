The Court holds\nthat \u201cactual fraud\u201d encompasses fraudulent transfer schemes\neffectuated without any false representation to a creditor and\nconcludes that a debt for goods may \u201csometimes\u201d be \u201cobtained by\u201d a\nfraudulent transfer scheme.Ante, at 3, 9. Because\n\u00a7523(a)(2)(A) does not apply so expansively, I respectfully\ndissent.IIn my view, \u201cactual fraud\u201d within the meaning\nof \u00a7523(a)(2) does not encompass fraudulent transfer schemes. There\nare two types of fraudulent transfer schemes: \u201ctransfers made with\nactual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud creditors, referred to\nas actual fraudulent transfers\u201d and \u201ctransfers made for less than\nreasonably equivalent value when a debtor was in financial trouble,\n[which is] referred to as constructive fraudulent transfers.\u201d 2\nBankruptcy Law Manual \u00a79A:29, p. 333 (5th ed. 2015). I do not\nquibble with the majority\u2019s conclusion that thecommon-lawdefinition of \u201cactual fraud\u201d included fraudulent transfers.Ante, at 4\u20136. And I agree that, generally, we should give a\ncommon-law term of art its established common-law meaning.Ante, at 4. Nevertheless, the \u201cgeneral rule that a\ncommon-law term of art should be given its established common-law\nmeaning\u201d gives way \u201cwhere that meaning does not fit.\u201dUnited\nStatesv.Castleman, 572 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2014)\n(slip op.,at 5) (internal quotation marks omitted). Ultimately,\n\u201c[s]tatutory language must be read in context and a phrase gathers\nmeaning from the words around it.\u201dJonesv.United\nStates, 527 U.\u00a0S. 373, 389 (1999) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). In my view, context dictates that \u201cactual fraud\u201d\nordinarily does not include fraudulent transfers because \u201cthat\nmeaning does not fit\u201d with the rest of \u00a7523(a)(2).Castleman,supra,at ___ (slip op., at 5) (internal\nquotation marks omitted).Section 523(a)(2) covers only situations in\nwhich \u201cmoney, property, [or] services\u201d are \u201cobtained by\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. actualfraud,\u201d and results in a debt. SeeCohenv.de la Cruz, 523 U.\u00a0S. 213, 218 (1998) .\nThe statutory phrase \u201cobtained by\u201d is an important limitation on\nthe reach of the provision. Section 523(a)(2)(A) applies only when\nthe fraudulent conduct occurs at theinception of the debt,i.e.,when the debtor commits a fraudulent act to induce the\ncreditor to part with his money, property, services, or credit. The\nlogical conclusion then is that \u201cactual fraud\u201d\u2014as it is used in the\nstatute\u2014covers only those situations in which some sort of\nfraudulent conduct caused the creditor to enter into a transaction\nwith the debtor. A fraudulent transfer generally does not fit that\nmold, unless, perhaps, the fraudulent transferor and the fraudulent\ntransferee conspired to fraudulently drain the assets of the\ncreditor. But the fraudulent transfer here, like all but the rarest\nfraudulent transfers, did not trick the creditor into selling his\ngoods to the buyer, Chrysalis Manufacturing Corporation. It follows\nthat the goods that resulted in the debt here were not \u201cobtained\nby\u201d actual fraud. \u00a7523(a)(2)(A).AI reach this conclusion based on the plain\nmeaning of the phrase \u201cobtained by,\u201d which has an \u201cinherent\u201d\n\u201celement of causation,\u201d and refers to those debts \u201cresulting from\u201d\nor \u201ctraceable to\u201d fraud.Fieldv.Mans, 516\nU.\u00a0S. 59, 61, 64, 66 (1995) . As I have stated, \u201cin order for\na creditor to establish that a debt is not dischargeable, he must\ndemonstrate that there is a causal nexus between the fraud and the\ndebt.\u201dArcherv.Warner, 538 U.\u00a0S. 314, 325\n(2003) (Thomas, J., dissenting) (relying onField,supra,at 61, 64, andCohen,supra, at 218).\nThere is also \u201c[n]o .\u00a0.\u00a0. doub[t] that some degree of\nreliance is required to satisfy th[is] element of causation.\u201dField,516 U.\u00a0S., at 66. The upshot of the phrase\n\u201cobtained by\u201d is that \u00a7523(a)(2) covers only those debts that\nresult from fraud at the inception of a credit transaction. Such a\ndebt caused by fraud necessarily \u201cfollowsa transfer of\nvalue or extension of credit induced by falsity or fraud.\u201dIbid.(emphasis added).Bankruptcy treatises confirm that \u201c[t]he phrase\n\u2018to the extent obtained by\u2019 is properly read as meaning \u2018obtained\nfrom\u2019 the creditor.\u201d 3 W. Norton & W. Norton, Bankruptcy Law\nand Practice \u00a757:15, p. 57\u201335 (3d ed. 2015). The \u201cterm \u2018by\u2019 refers\nto the manner in which such money, property, services is obtained\nand the creditor defrauded.\u201dIbid.According to Collier on\nBankruptcy, to invoke \u00a7523(a)(2)(A) based on \u201cactual fraud,\u201d a\ncreditor \u201cmust establish\u201d that he \u201cjustifiably relied\u201d on the\ndebtor\u2019s \u201crepresentation,\u201d which the debtor \u201cknew to be false\u201d and\nmade \u201cwith the intent and purpose of deceiving the\u201d creditor and\nthat the creditor \u201csustained a loss or damage as the proximate\nconsequence.\u201d 4 Collier on Bankruptcy \u00b6523.08[1][e], p. 523\u201347 (A.\nResnick & H. Sommer eds., 16th ed. 2015). Norton Bankruptcy Law\nand Practice is in accord: Section 523(a)(2)(A) requires a\n\u201cmisrepresentation,\u201d \u201cknowledge of falsity,\u201d \u201cintent to defraud,\u201d\n\u201cjustifiable reliance,\u201d and \u201cresulting damage.\u201d 3 Norton,supra, \u00a757:15, at 57\u201333 to 57\u201334.BApplying those principles here, Husky cannot\ninvoke \u00a7523(a)(2)(A) to except the debt owed to it from discharge\nbecause, ordinarily, it would be nonsensical to say that a\nfraudulent transfer created the debt at issue. As the majority\nnotes, the debt at issue did not originate from any transaction\nbetween Ritz and Husky.Ante, at 1\u20132. Instead, Husky sold\ngoods to Chrysalis, a company that Ritz financially controlled.Ibid. In turn, Chrysalis\u2014not Ritz\u2014incurred a debt to Husky\nof $163,999.38 for the goods.Ante, at 1. As the Bankruptcy\nCourt found, there is no evidence that Ritz made \u201cany oral or\nwritten representations to HuskyinducingHusky to enter\ninto a contract with Chrysalis.\u201dIn\u00a0re Ritz, 459\nB.\u00a0R. 623, 628 (SD Tex. 2011). In fact, the only communication\nbetween Ritz and Husky occurred after Husky and Chrysalis entered\ninto the contract and after Husky had shipped the goods to\nChrysalis.Ibid.The Bankruptcy Court also found that there\nwas no evidence that Ritz transferred the funds to avoid Chrysalis\u2019\nobligations to pay the debt it owed to Husky\u2014an unsecured creditor.Id.,at 635. Because Husky does not contend that Ritz\nfraudulently induced it to sell goods to Chrysalis and cannot show\nthat the constructive fraudulent conveyance had anything to do with\nits decision to contract with Chrysalis, Husky has not established\nthat \u00a7523(a)(2)(a) covers any debt owed to it.IIThe majority reaches the opposite conclusion\nand holds that \u00a7523(a)(2) may prevent an individual debtor from\nobtaining a discharge even if (1) the debtor makes no false\nrepresentation to the creditor, (2) the creditor does not rely on\nany of the debtor\u2019s actions or inactions, and (3)\u00a0there was no\nactual fraudulent conveyance at the inception of the credit\ntransaction between the creditor and the debtor.Ante, at\n5\u20136, 9. It does so by giving new meaning to the phrase \u201cobtained\nby\u201d in cases involv-ing fraudulent transfers, disregarding our case\nlaw, and second-guessing Congress\u2019 choices.Ante, at 9.The majority admits that a transferor \u201cdoes not\n\u2018obtai[n]\u2019 debts in a fraudulent conveyance,\u201d but contends that\n\u201cthe recipient of the transfer\u2014who, with the requisite intent, also\ncommits fraud\u2014can \u2018obtain\u2019 assets \u2018by\u2019 his or her participation in\nthe fraud.\u201dIbid.(brackets omitted). \u201cIf that recipient\nlater files for bankruptcy, any debts trace-able to the fraudulent\nconveyance,\u201d the majority states, \u201cwill be nondischargable under\n\u00a7523(a)(2)(A).\u201dIbid.(internal quotation marks omitted).\nThe majority thus holds that \u201cat least sometimes a debt \u2018obtained\nby\u2019 a fraudulent conveyance scheme could be nondischargeable under\n\u00a7523(a)(2)(A).\u201dIbid.But \u00a7523(a)(2)(A) does not exempt from\ndischarge any debts \u201ctraceable to the fraudulent conveyance.\u201d\nInstead, \u00a7523(a)(2)(A) exempts from discharge \u201cany debt for\u201d goods\nthat are \u201cobtained by\u201d actual fraud. And, as explained, it is\nextremely rare that a creditor will use an actual fraudulent\ntransfer scheme to induce a creditor to depart with property,\nservices, money, or credit. Seesupra, at 2\u20133.In reaching its conclusion, the majority also\ndisregards this Court\u2019s precedents interpreting \u00a7523(a)(2)(A),\npresumably because those cases did not involve fraudulent\ntransfers. The majority citesFieldonly for the elemental\nproposition that this Court \u201chas historically construed the terms\nin \u00a7523(a)(2)(A) to contain the \u2018elements that the common law has\ndefined them to include.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAnte, at 4 (quoting 516\nU.\u00a0S., at 69). The majority omitsField\u2019s conclusion\nthat one of the elements of \u201cactual fraud\u201d in \u00a7523(a)(2)(A) is\n\u201creliance\u201d on some sort of false statement,\nmisrepresentation, or omission.Id., at 70 (emphasis added).\nTo be sure, like the rest of our cases interpreting \u00a7523(a)(2)(A),Fieldinvolves a false statement. But that factual\ndistinction is immaterial. Cases likeField\u2014which interpret\nthe phrase \u201cobtained by\u201d\u2014are as relevant in cases that involve\nfalse statements and misrepresentations as they are in a case like\nthis one. After all, \u201cobtained by\u201d modifies false pretenses, false\nrepresentations, and actual fraud in \u00a7523(a)(2)(A). And in no case\nhas this Court suggested\u2014never mind held\u2014that \u00a7523(a)(2)(A) may\napply to circumstances in which there was no false statement,\nmisrepresentation, or omission when the debt was first\nobtained.The majority ostensibly creates a new definition\nof \u201cobtained by\u201d because it thinks that this move is necessary to\navoid rendering \u201cactual fraud\u201d superfluous. Seeante,at 4,\n7\u20138. Not so. Actual fraud is broader than false pretenses or false\nrepresentations, and \u201cconsists of any deceit, artifice, trick, or\ndesign involving direct and active operation of the mind, used to\ncircumvent and cheat another.\u201d 4 Collier on Bankruptcy\n\u00b6523.08[1][e], at 523\u201346. \u201cUnlike false pretenses or false\nrepresentation, actual fraud, within the meaning of the\ndischargeability exception, can focuson a promise of future\nperformance made with intent not to perform.\u201d 2F Bankruptcy Service\n\u00a727:211, p. 59 (Supp. Jan. 2016). In this way, \u201cthe actual fraud\u201d\nexception \u201cpermit[s] the courts to except from discharge debts\nincurred without intent to repay, or by use of other false implied\nrepresentations, without the need to stretch the false pretenses\nand false representations language.\u201d Zaretsky, The Fraud Exception\nto Discharge Under the New Bankruptcy Code, 53 Am. Bankruptcy\nL.\u00a0J. 253, 257 (1979). Some courts, for example, have held\nthat \u201ca debtor commits actual fraud within the meaning of\n\u00a7523(a)(2)(A) when he incurs credit card debt with no actual,\nsubjective intent to repay it,\u201d but has not made an affirmatively\nfalse representation or engaged in false pretense.In\u00a0re\nMorrow, 488 B.\u00a0R. 471, 479\u2013480 (Bkrtcy. Ct. ND Ga. 2012);\nsee also,e.g., In re Alam, 314 B.\u00a0R. 834, 841 (Bkrtcy.\nCt. ND Ga. 2004). Defining actual fraud this way does not render\nthat term superfluous and\u2014unlike the majority\u2019s definition\u2014does not\nrender \u201cobtained by\u201d a nullity.Regardless, even if there is some overlap\nbetween the definitions of \u201cfalse pretenses,\u201d \u201cfalse\nrepresentations,\u201d and \u201cactual fraud,\u201d \u201c[r]edundancies across\nstatutes are not unusual events in drafting.\u201dConnecticut Nat.\nBankv.Germain, 503 U.\u00a0S. 249, 253 (1992) . \u201c[T]he\ncanon against surplusage assists only where a competing\ninterpretation gives effect to every clause and word of a statute.\u201dMarxv.General Revenue Corp., 568 U.\u00a0S. ___,\n___ (2013) (slip op., at 13) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\u201cBut, in this case, no interpretation of [\u00a7523(a)(2)(A)] gives\neffect to every word.\u201dIbid.Under either my reading or the\nmajor-ity\u2019s reading, \u201cactual fraud\u201d is broader than and subsumes\n\u201cfalse pretenses\u201d and \u201cfalse representations.\u201d Accordingly, that\n\u201cactual fraud\u201d may introduce some redundancy in the statute is not\ndispositive.At bottom, the majority\u2019s attempt to broaden\n\u00a7523(a)(2)(A) to cover fraudulent transfers impermissibly\nsecond-guesses Congress\u2019 choices. When Congress wants to stop a\ndebtor from discharging a debt that he has concealed through a\nfraudulent transfer scheme, it ordinarily says so. See \u00a7727(a)(2)\n(stating that a court shall grant the debtor a discharge unless the\ndebtor engages in an actual fraudulent transfer scheme within a\ncertain time of filing a bankruptcy petition). If Congress wanted\n\u00a7523(a)(2)(A) to cover fraudulent transfer situations, \u201cit would\nhave spoken more clearly to that effect.\u201dStaplesv.UnitedStates, 511 U.\u00a0S. 600, 620 (1994) .\nUltimately, \u201cit is not for us to substitute our view of policy for\nthe legislation which has been passed by Congress.\u201dFlorida\nDept. of Revenuev.Piccadilly Cafeterias, Inc., 554\nU.\u00a0S. 33, 52 (2008) (ellipsis and internal quotation marks\nomitted).*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*The majority today departs from the plain\nlanguage of \u00a7523(a)(2)(A), as interpreted by our precedents.\nBecause I find no support for the Court\u2019s conclusion in the text of\nthe Bankruptcy Code, I respectfully dissent.",
