LTD, PETITIONER v. CLS\nBANK INTERNATIONAL et\u00a0al.on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the federal circuit[June 19, 2014]Justice Thomas\ndelivered the opinion of the Court.The patents at issue in\nthis case disclose a computer-implemented scheme for mitigating\n\u201csettlement risk\u201d (i.e., the risk that only one party\nto a financial transaction will pay what it owes) by using a\nthird-party intermediary. The question presented is whether these\nclaims are patent eligible under 35 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7101,\nor are instead drawn to a patent-ineligible abstract idea. We hold\nthat the claims at issue are drawn to the abstract idea of\nintermediated settlement, and that merely requiring generic\ncomputer implementation fails to transform that abstract idea into\na patent-eligible invention. We therefore affirm the judgment of\nthe United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.IAPetitioner Alice\nCorporation is the assignee of several patents that disclose\nschemes to manage certain forms of financial risk. [1] According to the specification largely\nshared by the patents, the invention \u201cenabl[es] the\nmanagement of risk relating to specified, yet unknown, future\nevents.\u201d App. 248. The specification further explains that\nthe \u201cinvention relates to methods and apparatus, including\nelectrical computers and data processing systems applied to\nfinancial matters and risk management.\u201d Id., at 243.The claims at issue\nrelate to a computerized scheme for mitigating \u201csettlement\nrisk\u201d\u2014i.e., the risk that only one party to an\nagreed-upon financial exchange will satisfy its obligation. In\nparticular, the claims are designed to facilitate the exchange of\nfinancial obligations between two parties by using a computer\nsystem as a third-party intermediary. Id., at 383\u2013384. [2] The intermediary creates\n\u201cshadow\u201d credit and debit records (i.e., account\nledgers) that mirror the balances in the parties\u2019 real-world\naccounts at \u201cexchange institutions\u201d (e.g., banks). The\nintermediary updates the shadow records in real time as\ntransactions are entered, allowing \u201conly those transactions\nfor which the parties\u2019 updated shadow records indicate\nsufficient resources to satisfy their mutual obligations.\u201d\n717 F.\u00a03d 1269, 1285 (CA Fed. 2013) (Lourie, J., concurring).\nAt the end of the day, the intermediary instructs the relevant\nfinancial institutions to carry out the \u201cpermitted\u201d\ntransactions in accordance with the updated shadow records, ibid.,\nthus mitigating the risk that only one party will perform the\nagreed-upon exchange.In sum, the patents in\nsuit claim (1) the foregoing method for exchanging obligations (the\nmethod claims), (2) a computer system configured to carry out the\nmethod for exchanging obligations (the system claims), and (3) a\ncomputer-readable medium containing program code for performing the\nmethod of exchanging obligations (the media claims). All of the\nclaims are implemented using a computer; the system and media\nclaims expressly recite a computer, and the parties have stipulated\nthat the method claims require a computer as well.BRespondents CLS Bank\nInternational and CLS Services Ltd. (together, CLS Bank) operate a\nglobal network that facilitates currency transactions. In 2007, CLS\nBank filed suit against petitioner, seeking a declaratory judgment\nthat the claims at issue are invalid, unenforceable, or not\ninfringed. Petitioner counterclaimed, alleging infringement.\nFollowing this Court\u2019s decision in Bilski v. Kappos, 561\nU.\u00a0S. 593 (2010) , the parties filed cross-motions for summary\njudgment on whether the asserted claims are eligible for patent\nprotection under 35 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7101. The District\nCourt held that all of the claims are patent ineligible because\nthey are directed to the abstract idea of \u201cemploying a\nneutral intermediary to facilitate simultaneous exchange of\nobligations in order to minimize risk.\u201d 768 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d\n221, 252 (DC 2011).A divided panel of the\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed,\nholding that it was not \u201cmanifestly evident\u201d that\npetitioner\u2019s claims are directed to an abstract idea. 685\nF.\u00a03d 1341, 1352, 1356 (2012). The Federal Circuit granted\nrehearing en banc, vacated the panel opinion, and affirmed the\njudgment of the District Court in a one-paragraph per curiam\nopinion. 717 F.\u00a03d, at 1273. Seven of the ten participating\njudges agreed that petitioner\u2019s method and media claims are\npatent ineligible. See id., at 1274 (Lourie, J., concurring); id.,\nat 1312\u20131313 (Rader, C.\u00a0J., concurring in part and\ndissenting in part). With respect to petitioner\u2019s system\nclaims, the en banc Federal Circuit affirmed the District\nCourt\u2019s judgment by an equally divided vote. Id., at\n1273.Writing for a\nfive-member plurality, Judge Lourie concluded that all of the\nclaims at issue are patent ineligible. In the plurality\u2019s\nview, under this Court\u2019s decision in Mayo Collaborative\nServices v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc., 566 U.\u00a0S. ___\n(2012), a court must first \u201cidentif[y] the abstract idea\nrepresented in the claim,\u201d and then determine \u201cwhether\nthe balance of the claim adds \u2018significantly\nmore.\u2019\u00a0\u201d 717 F.\u00a03d, at 1286. The plurality\nconcluded that petitioner\u2019s claims \u201cdraw on the\nabstract idea of reducing settlement risk by effecting trades\nthrough a third-party intermediary,\u201d and that the use of a\ncomputer to maintain, adjust, and reconcile shadow accounts added\nnothing of substance to that abstract idea. Ibid.Chief Judge Rader\nconcurred in part and dissented in part. In a part of the opinion\njoined only by Judge Moore, Chief Judge Rader agreed with the\nplurality that petitioner\u2019s method and media claims are drawn\nto an abstract idea. Id., at 1312\u20131313. In a part of the\nopinion joined by Judges Linn, Moore, and O\u2019Malley, Chief\nJudge Rader would have held that the system claims are patent\neligible because they involve computer \u201chardware\u201d that\nis \u201cspecifically programmed to solve a complex\nproblem.\u201d Id., at 1307. Judge Moore wrote a separate opinion\ndissenting in part, arguing that the system claims are patent\neligible. Id., at 1313\u20131314. Judge Newman filed an opinion\nconcurring in part and dissenting in part, arguing that all of\npetitioner\u2019s claims are patent eligible. Id., at 1327. Judges\nLinn and O\u2019Malley filed a separate dissenting opinion\nreaching that same conclusion. Ibid.We granted certiorari,\n571 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2013), and now affirm.IISection 101 of the\nPatent Act defines the subject matter eligible for patent\nprotection. It provides:\u201cWhoever\ninvents or discovers any new and useful process, machine,\nmanufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful\nimprovement thereof, may obtain a patent therefor, subject to the\nconditions and requirements of this title.\u201d 35\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7101.\u201cWe have long held that this provision\ncontains an important implicit exception: Laws of nature, natural\nphenomena, and abstract ideas are not patentable.\u201d\nAssociation for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc., 569\nU.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 11) (internal quotation\nmarks and brackets omitted). We have interpreted \u00a7101 and its\npredecessors in light of this exception for more than 150 years.\nBilski, supra, at 601\u2013602; see also O\u2019Reilly v. Morse,\n15 How. 62, 112\u2013120 (1854); Le Roy v. Tatham, 14 How. 156,\n174\u2013175 (1853).We have described the\nconcern that drives this exclusionary principle as one of\npre-emption. See, e.g., Bilski, supra, at 611\u2013612 (upholding\nthe patent \u201cwould pre-empt use of this approach in all\nfields, and would effectively grant a monopoly over an abstract\nidea\u201d). Laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas\nare \u201c\u00a0\u2018\u00a0\u201cthe basic tools of scientific\nand technological work.\u201d\u00a0\u2019\u00a0\u201d Myriad,\nsupra, at ___ (slip op., at 11). \u201c[M]onopolization of those\ntools through the grant of a patent might tend to impede innovation\nmore than it would tend to promote it,\u201d thereby thwarting the\nprimary object of the patent laws. Mayo, supra, at ___ (slip op.,\nat 2); see U.\u00a0S. Const., Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 8 (Congress\n\u201cshall have Power .\u00a0.\u00a0. To promote the Progress of\nScience and useful Arts\u201d). We have \u201crepeatedly\nemphasized this .\u00a0.\u00a0. concern that patent law not inhibit\nfurther discovery by improperly tying up the future use of\u201d\nthese building blocks of human ingenuity. Mayo, supra, at ___ (slip\nop., at 16) (citing Morse, supra, at 113).At the same time, we\ntread carefully in construing this exclusionary principle lest it\nswallow all of patent law. Mayo, 566 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 2). At some level, \u201call inventions .\u00a0.\u00a0. embody,\nuse, reflect, rest upon, or apply laws of nature, natural\nphenomena, or abstract ideas.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op., at 2).\nThus, an invention is not rendered ineligible for patent simply\nbecause it involves an abstract concept. See Diamond v. Diehr, 450\nU.\u00a0S. 175, 187 (1981) . \u201c[A]pplication[s]\u201d of such\nconcepts \u201c\u00a0\u2018to a new and useful\nend,\u2019\u00a0\u201d we have said, remain eligible for patent\nprotection. Gottschalk v. Benson, 409 U.\u00a0S. 63, 67 (1972)\n.Accordingly, in\napplying the \u00a7101 exception, we must distinguish between\npatents that claim the \u201c\u00a0\u2018buildin[g]\nblock[s]\u2019\u00a0\u201d of human ingenuity and those that\nintegrate the building blocks into something more, Mayo, 566\nU.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 20), thereby\n\u201ctransform[ing]\u201d them into a patent-eligible invention,\nid., at ___ (slip op., at 3). The former \u201cwould risk\ndisproportionately tying up the use of the underlying\u201d ideas,\nid., at ___ (slip op., at 4), and are therefore ineligible for\npatent protection. The latter pose no comparable risk of\npre-emption, and therefore remain eligible for the monopoly granted\nunder our patent laws.IIIIn Mayo Collaborative\nServices v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc., 566 U.\u00a0S. ___\n(2012), we set forth a framework for distinguishing patents that\nclaim laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas from\nthose that claim patent-eligible applications of those concepts.\nFirst, we determine whether the claims at issue are directed to one\nof those patent-ineligible concepts. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 8).\nIf so, we then ask, \u201c[w]hat else is there in the claims\nbefore us?\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op., at 9). To answer that\nquestion, we consider the elements of each claim both individually\nand \u201cas an ordered combination\u201d to determine whether\nthe additional elements \u201ctransform the nature of the\nclaim\u201d into a patent-eligible application. Id., at ___ (slip\nop., at 10, 9). We have described step two of this analysis as a\nsearch for an \u201c\u00a0\u2018inventive\nconcept\u2019\u00a0\u201d\u2014i.e., an element or combination\nof elements that is \u201csufficient to ensure that the patent in\npractice amounts to significantly more than a patent upon the\n[ineligible concept] itself.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op., at 3). [3]AWe must first\ndetermine whether the claims at issue are directed to a\npatent-ineligible concept. We conclude that they are: These claims\nare drawn to the abstract idea of intermediated settlement.The \u201cabstract\nideas\u201d category embodies \u201cthe longstanding rule that\n\u2018[a]n idea of itself is not patentable.\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nBenson, supra, at 67 (quoting Rubber-Tip Pencil Co. v. Howard, 20\nWall. 498, 507 (1874)); see also Le Roy, supra, at 175 (\u201cA\nprinciple, in the abstract, is a fundamental truth; an original\ncause; a motive; these cannot be patented, as no one can claim in\neither of them an exclusive right\u201d). In Benson, for example,\nthis Court rejected as ineligible patent claims involving an\nalgorithm for converting binary-coded decimal numerals into pure\nbinary form, holding that the claimed patent was \u201cin\npractical effect .\u00a0.\u00a0. a pat- ent on the algorithm\nitself.\u201d 409 U.\u00a0S., at 71\u201372. And in Parker v.\nFlook, 437 U.\u00a0S. 584 \u2013595 (1978), we held that a\nmathematical formula for computing \u201calarm limits\u201d in a\ncatalytic conversion process was also a patent-ineligible abstract\nidea.We most recently\naddressed the category of abstract ideas in Bilski v. Kappos, 561\nU.\u00a0S. 593 (2010) . The claims at issue in Bilski described a\nmethod for hedging against the financial risk of price\nfluctuations. Claim 1 recited a series of steps for hedging risk,\nincluding: (1) initiating a series of financial transactions\nbetween providers and consumers of a commodity; (2) identifying\nmarket participants that have a counterrisk for the same commodity;\nand (3) initiating a series of transactions between those market\nparticipants and the commodity provider to balance the risk\nposition of the first series of consumer transactions. Id., at 599.\nClaim 4 \u201cpu[t] the concept articulated in claim 1 into a\nsimple mathematical formula.\u201d Ibid. The remaining claims were\ndrawn to examples of hedging in commodities and energy markets.\u201c[A]ll members of\nthe Court agree[d]\u201d that the patent at issue in Bilski\nclaimed an \u201cabstract idea.\u201d Id., at 609; see also id.,\nat 619 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment). Specifically, the\nclaims described \u201cthe basic concept of hedging, or protecting\nagainst risk.\u201d Id., at 611. The Court explained that\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018[h]edging is a fundamental economic practice\nlong prevalent in our system of commerce and taught in any\nintroductory finance class.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Ibid. \u201cThe\nconcept of hedging\u201d as recited by the claims in suit was\ntherefore a patent-ineligible \u201cabstract idea, just like the\nalgorithms at issue in Benson and Flook.\u201d Ibid.It follows from our\nprior cases, and Bilski in particular, that the claims at issue\nhere are directed to an abstract idea. Petitioner\u2019s claims\ninvolve a method of exchanging financial obligations between two\nparties using a third-party intermediary to mitigate settlement\nrisk. The intermediary creates and updates \u201cshadow\u201d\nrecords to reflect the value of each party\u2019s actual accounts\nheld at \u201cexchange institutions,\u201d thereby permitting\nonly those transactions for which the parties have sufficient\nresources. At the end of each day, the intermediary issues\nirrevocable instructions to the exchange institutions to carry out\nthe permitted transactions.On their face, the\nclaims before us are drawn to the concept of intermediated\nsettlement, i.e., the use of a third party to mitigate settlement\nrisk. Like the risk hedging in Bilski, the concept of intermediated\nsettlement is \u201c\u00a0\u2018a fundamental economic practice\nlong prevalent in our system of commerce.\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nIbid.; see, e.g., Emery, Speculation on the Stock and Produce\nExchanges of the United States, in 7 Studies in History, Economics\nand Public Law 283, 346\u2013356 (1896) (discussing the use of a\n\u201cclearing-house\u201d as an intermediary to reduce\nsettlement risk). The use of a third-party intermediary (or\n\u201cclearing house\u201d) is also a building block of the\nmodern economy. See, e.g., Yadav, The Problematic Case of\nClearinghouses in Complex Markets, 101 Geo. L. J. 387,\n406\u2013412 (2013); J. Hull, Risk Management and Financial\nInstitutions 103\u2013104 (3d ed. 2012). Thus, intermediated\nsettlement, like hedging, is an \u201cabstract idea\u201d beyond\nthe scope of \u00a7101.Petitioner acknowledges\nthat its claims describe intermediated settlement, see Brief for\nPetitioner 4, but rejects the conclusion that its claims recite an\n\u201cabstract idea.\u201d Drawing on the presence of\nmathematical formulas in some of our abstract-ideas precedents,\npetitioner contends that the abstract-ideas category is confined to\n\u201cpreexisting, fundamental truth[s]\u201d that\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018exis[t\u00a0] in principle apart from any human\naction.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Id., at 23, 26 (quoting Mayo, 566\nU.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 8)).Bilski belies\npetitioner\u2019s assertion. The concept of risk hedging we\nidentified as an abstract idea in that case cannot be described as\na \u201cpreexisting, fundamental truth.\u201d The patent in\nBilski simply involved a \u201cseries of steps instructing how to\nhedge risk.\u201d 561 U.\u00a0S., at 599. Al-though hedging is a\nlongstanding commercial practice, id., at 599, it is a method of\norganizing human activity, not a \u201ctruth\u201d about the\nnatural world \u201c\u00a0\u2018that has always\nexisted,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Brief for Petitioner 22 (quoting\nFlook, supra, at 593, n.\u00a015). One of the claims in Bilski\nreduced hedging to a mathematical formula, but the Court did not\nassign any special significance to that fact, much less the sort of\ntalismanic significance petitioner claims. Instead, the Court\ngrounded its conclusion that all of the claims at issue were\nabstract ideas in the understanding that risk hedging was a\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018fundamental economic\npractice.\u2019\u00a0\u201d 561 U.\u00a0S., at 611.In any event, we need\nnot labor to delimit the precise contours of the \u201cabstract\nideas\u201d category in this case. It is enough to recognize that\nthere is no meaningful distinction between the concept of risk\nhedging in Bilski and the concept of intermediated settlement at\nissue here. Both are squarely within the realm of \u201cabstract\nideas\u201d as we have used that term.BBecause the claims at\nissue are directed to the abstract idea of intermediated\nsettlement, we turn to the second step in Mayo\u2019s framework.\nWe conclude that the method claims, which merely require generic\ncomputer implementation, fail to transform that abstract idea into\na patent-eligible invention.1At Mayo step two, we\nmust examine the elements of the claim to determine whether it\ncontains an \u201c\u00a0\u2018inventive\nconcept\u2019\u00a0\u201d sufficient to \u201ctransform\u201d\nthe claimed abstract idea into a patent-eligible application. 566\nU.\u00a0S., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 3, 11). A claim that recites\nan abstract idea must include \u201cadditional features\u201d to\nensure \u201cthat the [claim] is more than a drafting effort\ndesigned to monopolize the [abstract idea].\u201d Id., at ___\n(slip op., at 8\u20139). Mayo made clear that transformation into\na patent-eligible application requires \u201cmore than simply\nstat[ing] the [abstract idea] while adding the words \u2018apply\nit.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op., at 3).Mayo itself is\ninstructive. The patents at issue in Mayo claimed a method for\nmeasuring metabolites in the bloodstream in order to calibrate the\nappropriate dosage of thiopurine drugs in the treatment of\nautoimmune dis- eases. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 4\u20136). The\nrespondent in that case contended that the claimed method was a\npatent-eligible application of natural laws that describe the\nrelationship between the concentration of certain metabolites and\nthe likelihood that the drug dosage will be harmful or ineffective.\nBut methods for determining metabolite levels were already\n\u201cwell known in the art,\u201d and the process at issue\namounted to \u201cnothing significantly more than an instruction\nto doctors to apply the applicable laws when treating their\npatients.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op., at 10). \u201cSimply\nappending conventional steps, specified at a high level of\ngenerality,\u201d was not \u201cenough\u201d to supply an\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018inventive concept.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Id., at\n___, ___, ___ (slip op., at 14, 8, 3).The introduction of a\ncomputer into the claims does not alter the analysis at Mayo step\ntwo. In Benson, for example, we considered a patent that claimed an\nalgorithm implemented on \u201ca general-purpose digital\ncomputer.\u201d 409 U.\u00a0S., at 64. Because the algorithm was\nan abstract idea, see supra, at 8, the claim had to supply a\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018new and use-ful\u2019\u00a0\u201d application\nof the idea in order to be patent eligible. 409 U.\u00a0S., at 67.\nBut the computer implementation did not supply the necessary\ninventive concept; the process could be \u201ccarried out in\nexisting computers long in use.\u201d Ibid. We accordingly\n\u201cheld that simply implementing a mathematical principle on a\nphysical machine, namely a computer, [i]s not a patentable\napplication of that principle.\u201d Mayo, supra, at ___ (slip\nop., at 16) (citing Benson, supra, at 64).Flook is to the same\neffect. There, we examined a computerized method for using a\nmathematical formula to adjust alarm limits for certain operating\nconditions (e.g., temperature and pressure) that could signal\ninefficiency or danger in a catalytic conversion process. 437\nU.\u00a0S., at 585\u2013586. Once again, the formula itself was an\nabstract idea, see supra, at 8, and the computer implementation was\npurely conventional. 437 U.\u00a0S., at 594 (noting that the\n\u201cuse of computers for \u2018automatic\nmonitoring-alarming\u2019\u00a0\u201d was \u201cwell\nknown\u201d). In holding that the process was patent ineligible,\nwe rejected the argument that \u201cimplement[ing] a principle in\nsome specific fashion\u201d will \u201cautomatically fal[l]\nwithin the patentable subject matter of \u00a7101.\u201d Id., at\n593. Thus, \u201cFlook stands for the proposition that the\nprohibition against patenting abstract ideas cannot be circumvented\nby attempting to limit the use of [the idea] to a particular\ntechnological environment.\u201d Bilski, 561 U.\u00a0S., at\n610\u2013611 (internal quotation marks omitted).In Diehr, 450\nU.\u00a0S. 175 , by contrast, we held that a computer-implemented\nprocess for curing rubber was patent eligible, but not because it\ninvolved a computer. The claim employed a \u201cwell-known\u201d\nmathematical equation, but it used that equation in a process\ndesigned to solve a technological problem in \u201cconventional\nindustry practice.\u201d Id., at 177, 178. The invention in Diehr\nused a \u201cthermocouple\u201d to record constant temperature\nmeasure-ments inside the rubber mold\u2014something \u201cthe\nindustry ha[d] not been able to obtain.\u201d Id., at 178, and\nn.\u00a03. The temperature measurements were then fed into a\ncomputer, which repeatedly recalculated the remaining cure time by\nusing the mathematical equation. Id., at 178\u2013179. These\nadditional steps, we recently explained, \u201ctransformed the\nprocess into an inventive application of the formula.\u201d Mayo,\nsupra, at ___ (slip op., at 12). In other words, the claims in\nDiehr were patent eligible because they improved an existing\ntechnological process, not because they were implemented on a\ncomputer.These cases demonstrate\nthat the mere recitation of a generic computer cannot transform a\npatent-ineligible abstract idea into a patent-eligible invention.\nStating an abstract idea \u201cwhile adding the words \u2018apply\nit\u2019\u00a0\u201d is not enough for patent eligibility. Mayo,\nsupra, at ___ (slip op., at 3). Nor is limiting the use of an\nabstract idea \u201c\u00a0\u2018to a particular technological\nenvironment.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Bilski, supra, at 610\u2013611.\nStating an abstract idea while adding the words \u201capply it\nwith a computer\u201d simply combines those two steps, with the\nsame deficient result. Thus, if a patent\u2019s recitation of a\ncomputer amounts to a mere instruction to \u201cimplemen[t]\u201d\nan abstract idea \u201con .\u00a0.\u00a0. a computer,\u201d Mayo,\nsupra, at ___ (slip op., at 16), that addition cannot impart patent\neligibility. This conclusion accords with the pre-emption concern\nthat undergirds our \u00a7101 jurisprudence. Given the ubiquity of\ncomputers, see 717 F.\u00a03d, at 1286 (Lourie, J., concurring),\nwholly generic computer implementation is not generally the sort of\n\u201cadditional featur[e]\u201d that provides any\n\u201cpractical assurance that the process is more than a drafting\neffort designed to monopolize the [abstract idea] itself.\u201d\nMayo, 566 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 8\u20139).The fact that a\ncomputer \u201cnecessarily exist[s] in the physical, rather than\npurely conceptual, realm,\u201d Brief for Petitioner 39, is beside\nthe point. There is no dispute that a computer is a tangible system\n(in \u00a7101 terms, a \u201cmachine\u201d), or that many\ncomputer-implemented claims are formally addressed to\npatent-eligible subject matter. But if that were the end of the\n\u00a7101 inquiry, an applicant could claim any principle of the\nphysical or social sciences by reciting a computer system\nconfigured to implement the relevant concept. Such a result would\nmake the determination of patent eligibility \u201cdepend simply\non the draftsman\u2019s art,\u201d Flook, supra, at 593, thereby\neviscerating the rule that \u201c\u00a0\u2018[l]aws of nature,\nnatural phenomena, and abstract ideas are not\npatentable,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Myriad, 569 U.\u00a0S., at ___\n(slip op., at 11).2The representative\nmethod claim in this case recites the following steps: (1)\n\u201ccreating\u201d shadow records for each counterparty to a\ntransaction; (2) \u201cobtaining\u201d start-of-day balances\nbased on the parties\u2019 real-world accounts at exchange\ninstitutions; (3) \u201cadjusting\u201d the shadow records as\ntransactions are entered, allowing only those transactions for\nwhich the parties have sufficient resources; and (4) issuing\nirrevocable end-of-day instructions to the exchange institutions to\ncarry out the permitted transactions. See n.\u00a02, supra.\nPetitioner principally contends that the claims are patent eligible\nbecause these steps \u201crequire a substantial and meaningful\nrole for the computer.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 48. As\nstipulated, the claimed method requires the use of a computer to\ncreate electronic records, track multiple transactions, and issue\nsimultaneous instructions; in other words, \u201c[t]he computer is\nitself the intermediary.\u201d Ibid. (emphasis deleted).In light of the\nforegoing, see supra, at 11\u201314, the relevant question is\nwhether the claims here do more than simply instruct the\npractitioner to implement the abstract idea of intermediated\nsettlement on a generic computer. They do not.Taking the claim\nelements separately, the function performed by the computer at each\nstep of the process is \u201c[p]urely conventional.\u201d Mayo,\nsupra, at ___ (slip op., at 10) (internal quotation marks omitted).\nUsing a computer to create and maintain \u201cshadow\u201d\naccounts amounts to electronic recordkeeping\u2014one of the most\nbasic functions of a computer. See, e.g., Benson, 409 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 65 (noting that a computer \u201coperates .\u00a0.\u00a0. upon\nboth new and previously stored data\u201d). The same is true with\nrespect to the use of a computer to obtain data, adjust account\nbalances, and issue automated instructions; all of these computer\nfunctions are \u201cwell-understood, routine, conventional\nactivit[ies]\u201d previously known to the industry. Mayo, 566\nU.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 4). In short, each step does no\nmore than require a generic computer to perform generic computer\nfunctions.Considered \u201cas an\nordered combination,\u201d the computer components of\npetitioner\u2019s method \u201cad[d] nothing .\u00a0.\u00a0. that\nis not already present when the steps are considered\nseparately.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op., at 10). Viewed as a\nwhole, petitioner\u2019s method claims simply recite the concept\nof intermediated settlement as performed by a generic computer. See\n717 F.\u00a03d, at 1286 (Lourie, J., concurring) (noting that the\nrepresentative method claim \u201clacks any express language to\ndefine the computer\u2019s participation\u201d). The method\nclaims do not, for example, purport to improve the functioning of\nthe computer itself. See ibid. (\u201cThere is no specific or\nlimiting recitation of .\u00a0.\u00a0. improved computer technology\n.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d); Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae\n28\u201330. Nor do they effect an improvement in any other\ntechnology or technical field. See, e.g., Diehr, 450 U.\u00a0S., at\n177\u2013178. Instead, the claims at issue amount to\n\u201cnothing significantly more\u201d than an instruction to\napply the abstract idea of intermediated settlement using some\nunspecified, generic computer. Mayo, 566 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 10). Under our precedents, that is not \u201cenough\u201d\nto transform an abstract idea into a patent-eligible invention.\nId., at ___ (slip op., at 8).CPetitioner\u2019s\nclaims to a computer system and a computer-readable medium fail for\nsubstantially the same rea- sons. Petitioner conceded below that\nits media claims rise or fall with its method claims. En Banc\nResponse Brief for Defendant-Appellant in No. 11\u20131301 (CA\nFed.) p. 50, n.\u00a03. As to its system claims, petitioner\nemphasizes that those claims recite \u201cspecific hardware\u201d\nconfigured to perform \u201cspecific computerized\nfunctions.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 53. But what petitioner\ncharacterizes as specific hardware\u2014a \u201cdata processing\nsystem\u201d with a \u201ccommunications controller\u201d and\n\u201cdata storage unit,\u201d for example, see App. 954, 958,\n1257\u2014is purely functional and generic. Nearly every computer\nwill include a \u201ccommunications controller\u201d and\n\u201cdata storage unit\u201d capable of performing the basic\ncalculation, storage, and transmission functions required by the\nmethod claims. See 717 F.\u00a03d, at 1290 (Lourie, J.,\nconcurring). As a result, none of the hardware recited by the\nsystem claims \u201coffers a meaningful limitation beyond\ngenerally linking \u2018the use of the [method] to a particular\ntechnological environment,\u2019 that is, implementation via\ncomputers.\u201d Id., at 1291 (quoting Bilski, 561 U.\u00a0S., at\n610\u2013611).Put another way, the\nsystem claims are no different from the method claims in substance.\nThe method claims recite the abstract idea implemented on a generic\ncomputer; the system claims recite a handful of generic computer\ncomponents configured to implement the same idea. This Court has\nlong \u201cwarn[ed] .\u00a0.\u00a0. against\u201d interpreting\n\u00a7101 \u201cin ways that make patent eligibility \u2018depend\nsimply on the draftsman\u2019s art.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mayo,\nsupra, at ___ (slip op., at 3) (quoting Flook, 437 U.\u00a0S., at\n593); see id., at 590 (\u201cThe concept of patentable subject\nmatter under \u00a7101 is not \u2018like a nose of wax which may\nbe turned and twisted in any direction\n.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u2019\u00a0\u201d). Holding that the system\nclaims are patent eligible would have exactly that result.Because\npetitioner\u2019s system and media claims add nothing of substance\nto the underlying abstract idea, we hold that they too are patent\nineligible under \u00a7101.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*For the foregoing\nreasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Federal\nCircuit is affirmed.It is so ordered.Notes1The patents at issue are\nUnited States Patent Nos. 5,970,479 (the \u2019479 patent),\n6,912,510, 7,149,720, and 7,725,375.2The parties agree that\nclaim 33 of the \u2019479 patent is representative of the method\nclaims. Claim 33 recites: \u201cA method of exchanging obligations\nas between parties, each party holding a credit record and a debit\nrecord with an exchange institution, the credit records and debit\nrecords for exchange of predetermined obligations, the method\ncomprising the steps of: \u201c(a) creating a shadow credit record\nand a shadow debit record for each stakeholder party to be held\nindependently by a supervisory institution from the exchange\ninstitutions; \u201c(b) obtaining from each exchange institution a\nstart-of-day balance for each shadow credit record and shadow debit\nrecord; \u201c(c) for every transaction resulting in an exchange\nobligation, the supervisory institution adjusting each respective\nparty\u2019s shadow credit record or shadow debit record, allowing\nonly these transactions that do not result in the value of the\nshadow debit record being less than the value of the shadow credit\nrecord at any time, each said adjustment taking place in\nchronological order, and \u201c(d) at the end-of-day, the\nsupervisory institution instructing on[e] of the exchange\ninstitutions to exchange credits or debits to the credit record and\ndebit record of the respective parties in accordance with the\nadjustments of the said permitted transactions, the credits and\ndebits being irrevocable, time invariant obligations placed on the\nexchange institutions.\u201d App. 383\u2013384.3Because the approach we\nmade explicit in Mayo considers all claim elements, both\nindividually and in combination, it is consistent with the general\nrule that patent claims \u201cmust be considered as a\nwhole.\u201d Diamond v. Diehr, ; see Parker v. Flook, (\u201cOur\napproach .\u00a0.\u00a0. is .\u00a0.\u00a0. not at all inconsistent\nwith the view that a patent claim must be considered as a\nwhole\u201d).",
