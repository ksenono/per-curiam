    "text": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES_________________No. 10\u20138505_________________SANDY WILLIAMS, PETITIONER v. ILLINOISon writ of certiorari to the supreme court of\nillinois[June 18, 2012]Justice Kagan, with whom Justice Scalia,\nJustice Ginsburg, and Justice Sotomayor join, dissenting.Some years ago, the State of California\nprosecuted a man named John Kocak for rape. At a preliminary\nhearing, the State presented testimony from an analyst at the\nCellmark Diagnostics Laboratory\u2014the same facility used to generate\nDNA evidence in this case. The analyst had extracted DNA from a\nbloody sweatshirt found at the crime scene and then compared it to\ntwo control samples\u2014one from Kocak and one from the victim. The\nanalyst\u2019s report identified a single match: As she explained on\ndirect examination, the DNA found on the sweatshirt belonged to\nKocak. But after undergoing cross-examination, the analyst realized\nshe had made a mortifying error. She took the stand again, but this\ntime to admit that the report listed the victim\u2019s control sample as\ncoming from Kocak, and Kocak\u2019s as coming from the victim. So the\nDNA on the sweatshirt matched not Kocak, but the victim herself.\nSee Tr. in No. SCD110465 (Super. Ct. San Diego Cty., Cal., Nov. 17,\n1995), pp.\u00a03\u20134 (\u201cI\u2019m a little hysterical right now, but I\nthink .\u00a0.\u00a0. the two names should be switched\u201d), online at\nhttp://www.nlada.org/forensics/for_\nlib/Documents/1037341561.0/JohnIvanKocak.pdf (as vis- ited June 15,\n2012, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file). In trying\nKocak, the State would have to look elsewhere for its evidence.Our Constitution contains a mechanism for\ncatching such errors\u2014the Sixth Amendment\u2019s Confrontation Clause.\nThat Clause, and the Court\u2019s recent cases interpreting it, require\nthat testimony against a criminal defendant be subject to\ncross-examination. And that command applies with full force to\nforensic evidence of the kind involved in both the Kocak case and\nthis one. In two decisions issued in the last three years, this\nCourt held that if a prosecutor wants to introduce the results of\nforensic testing into evidence, he must afford the defendant an\nopportunity to cross-examine an analyst responsible for the test.\nForensic evidence is reliable only when properly produced, and the\nConfrontation Clause prescribes a particular method for determining\nwhether that has happened. The Kocak incident illustrates how the\nClause is designed to work: Once confronted, the analyst discovered\nand disclosed the error she had made. That error would probably not\nhave come to light if the prosecutor had merely admitted the report\ninto evidence or asked a third party to present its findings. Hence\nthe genius of an 18th-century device as applied to 21st-century\nevidence: Cross-examination of the analyst is especially likely to\nreveal whether vials have been switched, samples contaminated,\ntests incompetently run, or results inaccurately recorded.Under our Confrontation Clause precedents, this\nis an open-and-shut case. The State of Illinois prosecuted Sandy\nWilliams for rape based in part on a DNA profile created in\nCellmark\u2019s laboratory. Yet the State did not give Williams a chance\nto question the analyst who produced that evidence. Instead, the\nprosecution introduced the results of Cellmark\u2019s testing through an\nexpert witness who had no idea how they were generated. That\napproach\u2014no less (perhaps more) than the confrontation-free methods\nof presenting forensic evidence we have formerly banned\u2014deprived\nWilliams of his Sixth Amendment right to \u201cconfron[t]\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. the witnesses against him.\u201dThe Court today disagrees, though it cannot\nsettle on a reason why. Justice Alito, joined by three other Jus-\ntices, advances two theories\u2014that the expert\u2019s summary of the\nCellmark report was not offered for its truth, and that the report\nis not the kind of statement triggering the Confrontation Clause\u2019s\nprotection. In the pages that follow, I call Justice Alito\u2019s\nopinion \u201cthe plurality,\u201d because that is the conventional term for\nit. But in all except its disposition, his opinion is a dissent:\nFive Justices specifically reject every aspect of its reasoning and\nevery paragraph of its explication. See ante, at 1 (Thomas, J.,\nconcurring in judgment) (\u201cI share the dissent\u2019s view of the\nplurality\u2019s flawed analysis\u201d). Justice Thomas, for his part,\ncontends that the Cellmark report is nontestimonial on a different\nrationale. But no other Justice joins his opinion or subscribes to\nthe test he offers.That creates five votes to approve the admission\nof the Cellmark report, but not a single good explanation. The\nplurality\u2019s first rationale endorses a prosecutorial dodge; its\nsecond relies on distinguishing indistinguishable forensic reports.\nJustice Thomas\u2019s concurrence, though positing an altogether\ndifferent approach, suffers in the end from similar flaws. I would\nchoose another path\u2014to adhere to the simple rule established in our\ndecisions, for the good reasons we have previously given. Because\ndefendants like Williams have a constitutional right to confront\nthe witnesses against them, I respectfully dissent from the Court\u2019s\nfractured decision.IOur modern Confrontation Clause doctrine began\nwith Crawford v. Washington,541 U.S.\n36(2004) . About a quarter century earlier, we had interpreted\nthe Clause to allow the admission of any out-of-court statement\nfalling within a \u201cfirmly rooted hearsay exception\u201d or carrying\n\u201cparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\u201d Ohio v. Roberts,448 U.S.\n56, 66 (1980) . But in Crawford, we concluded that our old\napproach was misguided. Drawing on historical research about the\nClause\u2019s purposes, we held that the prosecution may not admit\n\u201ctestimonial statements of a witness who [does] not appear at trial\nunless he [is] unavailable to testify, and the defendant\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. had a prior opportunity for cross-examination.\u201d 541\nU.\u00a0S., at 53\u201354. That holding has two aspects. First, the\nConfrontation Clause applies only to out-of-court statements that\nare \u201ctestimonial.\u201d Second, where the Clause applies, it guarantees\nto a defendant just what its name suggests\u2014the opportunity to\ncross-examine the person who made the statement. See id., at\n59.A few years later, we made clear that Crawford\u2019s\nrule reaches forensic reports. In Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts,557 U.S.\n305(2009) , the Commonwealth introduced a laboratory\u2019s\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018certificates of analysis\u2019\u00a0\u201d stating that a substance\nseized from the defendant was cocaine. Id., at 308. We held that\nthe certificates fell within the Clause\u2019s \u201c\u00a0\u2018core class of\ntestimonial statements\u2019\u00a0\u201d because they had a clear\n\u201cevidentiary purpose\u201d: They were \u201c\u00a0\u2018made under circumstances\nwhich would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that\n[they] would be available for use at a later trial.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Id., at\n310\u2013311 (quoting Crawford, 541 U.\u00a0S., at 51\u201352). Accordingly,\nwe ruled, the defendant had a right to cross-examine the analysts\nwho had authored them. In reaching that conclusion, we rejected the\nCommonwealth\u2019s argument that the Confrontation Clause should not\napply because the statements resulted from \u201c\u00a0\u2018neutral\nscientific testing,\u2019\u00a0\u201d and so were presumptively reliable. 557\nU.\u00a0S., at 318. The Clause, we noted, commands that\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018reliability be assessed in a particular\nmanner\u2019\u00a0\u201d\u2014through \u201c\u00a0\u2018testing in the crucible of\ncross-examination.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Id., at 317 (quoting Crawford, 541\nU.\u00a0S., at 61). Further, we doubted that the testing summarized\nin the certificates was \u201cas neutral or as reliable\u201d as the\nCommonwealth suggested. Citing chapter and verse from various\nstudies, we concluded that \u201c[f]orensic evidence is not uniquely\nimmune from the risk of manipulation\u201d and mistake. 557 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 318; see id., at 319.And just two years later (and just one year\nago), we reiterated Melendez-Diaz\u2019s analysis when faced with a\nState\u2019s attempt to evade it. In Bullcoming v. New Mexico, 564\nU.\u00a0S. ___ (2011), a forensic report showed the defendant\u2019s\nblood-alcohol concentration to exceed the legal limit for drivers.\nThe State tried to introduce that finding through the testimony of\na person who worked at the laboratory but had not performed or\nobserved the blood test or certified its results. We held that\nMelendez-Diaz foreclosed that tactic. The report, we stated,\nresembled the certificates in Melendez-Diaz in \u201call material\nrespects,\u201d 564 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 15): Both were\nsigned documents providing the results of forensic testing designed\nto \u201c\u00a0\u2018prov[e] some fact\u2019 in a criminal proceeding,\u201d id., at\n___ (slip op., at 14) (quoting Melendez-Diaz, 557 U.\u00a0S., at\n310). And the State\u2019s resort to a \u201csurrogate\u201d witness, in place of\nthe analyst who produced the report, did not satisfy the\nConfrontation Clause. Bullcoming, 564 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 12). Only the presence of \u201cthat particular scientist,\u201d we\nreasoned, would enable Bullcoming\u2019s counsel to ask \u201cquestions\ndesigned to reveal whether incompetence .\u00a0.\u00a0. or\ndishonesty\u201d had tainted the results. Id., at ___, ___ (slip op., at\n2, 12). Repeating the refrain of Melendez-Diaz, we held that \u201c[t]he\naccused\u2019s right is to be confronted with\u201d the actual analyst,\nunless he is unavailable and the accused \u201chad an opportunity,\npretrial, to cross-examine\u201d him. Bullcoming, 564 U.\u00a0S., at ___\n(slip op., at 2).This case is of a piece. The report at issue\nhere shows a DNA profile produced by an analyst at Cellmark\u2019s\nlaboratory, allegedly from a vaginal swab taken from a young woman,\nL.\u00a0J., after she was raped. That report is identical to the\none in Bullcoming (and Melendez-Diaz) in \u201call material respects.\u201d\n564 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 15). Once again, the report\nwas made to establish \u201c\u00a0\u2018some fact\u2019 in a criminal\nproceeding\u201d\u2014here, the identity of L.\u00a0J.\u2019s attacker. Id., at\n___ (slip op., at 14) (quoting Melendez-Diaz, 557 U.\u00a0S., at\n310); see infra, at 20. And once again, it details the results of\nforensic testing on evidence gathered by the police. Viewed\nside-by-side with the Bullcoming report, the Cellmark analysis has\na comparable title; similarly describes the relevant samples, test\nmethodology, and results; and likewise includes the signatures of\nlaboratory officials. Compare Cellmark Diagnostics Report of\nLaboratory Examination (Feb. 15, 2001), Lodging of Petitioner with\nApp. in Bullcoming v. New Mexico, O.\u00a0T. 2010, No. 09\u201310876,\npp. 62\u201365. So under this Court\u2019s prior analysis, the substance of\nthe report could come into evidence only if Williams had a chance\nto cross-examine the responsible analyst.But that is not what happened. Instead, the\nprosecutor used Sandra Lambatos\u2014a state-employed scientist who had\nnot participated in the testing\u2014as the conduit for this piece of\nevidence. Lambatos came to the stand after two other state analysts\ntestified about forensic tests they had performed. One recounted\nhow she had developed a DNA profile of Sandy Williams from a blood\nsample drawn after his arrest. And another told how he had\nconfirmed the presence of (unidentified) semen on the vaginal swabs\ntaken from L.\u00a0J. All this was by the book: Williams had an\nopportunity to cross-examine both witnesses about the tests they\nhad run. But of course, the State still needed to supply the\nmissing link\u2014it had to show that DNA found in the semen on\nL.\u00a0J.\u2019s vaginal swabs matched Williams\u2019s DNA. To fill that\ngap, the prosecutor could have called the analyst from Cellmark to\ntestify about the DNA profile she had produced from the swabs. But\ninstead, the State called Lambatos as an expert witness and had her\ntestify that the semen on those swabs contained Sandy Williams\u2019s\nDNA:\u201cQ Was there a computer match generated of the\nmale DNA profile found in semen from the vaginal swabs of\n[L.\u00a0J.] to a male DNA profile that had been identified as\nhaving originated from Sandy Williams?\u201cA Yes, there was.\u201cQ Did you compare the semen .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nfrom the vaginal swabs of [L.\u00a0J.] to the male DNA profile\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. from the blood of Sandy Williams?\u201cA Yes, I did..\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003.\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003.\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003.\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003.\u201cQ [I]s the semen identified in the vaginal\nswabs of [L.\u00a0J.] consistent with having originated from Sandy\nWilliams?\u201cA Yes.\u201d App. 56\u201357.And so it was Lambatos, rather than any Cellmark\nemployee, who informed the trier of fact that the testing of\nL.\u00a0J.\u2019s vaginal swabs had produced a male DNA profile\nimplicating Williams.Have we not already decided this case?\nLambatos\u2019s testimony is functionally identical to the \u201csurrogate\ntestimony\u201d that New Mexico proffered in Bullcoming, which did\nnothing to cure the problem identified in Melendez-Diaz (which, for\nits part, straightforwardly applied our decision in Crawford). Like\nthe surrogate witness in Bullcoming, Lambatos \u201ccould not convey\nwhat [the actual analyst] knew or observed about the events\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. , i.e., the particular test and testing process he\nemployed.\u201d Bullcoming, 564 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 12).\n\u201cNor could such surrogate testimony expose any lapses or lies\u201d on\nthe testing analyst\u2019s part. Ibid. Like the lawyers in Melendez-Diaz\nand Bullcoming, Williams\u2019s attorney could not ask questions about\nthat analyst\u2019s \u201cproficiency, the care he took in performing his\nwork, and his veracity.\u201d 564 U.\u00a0S., at ___, n.\u00a07 (slip\nop., at 12, n.\u00a07). He could not probe whether the analyst had\ntested the wrong vial, inverted the labels on the samples,\ncommitted some more technical error, or simply made up the results.\nSee App. to Brief for Public Defender Service for the District of\nColumbia et\u00a0al. as Amici Curiae 5a, 11a (describing mistakes\nand fraud at Cellmark\u2019s laboratory). Indeed, Williams\u2019s lawyer was\neven more hamstrung than Bullcoming\u2019s. At least the surrogate\nwitness in Bullcoming worked at the relevant laboratory and was\nfamiliar with its procedures. That is not true of Lambatos: She had\nno knowledge at all of Cellmark\u2019s operations. Indeed, for all the\nrecord discloses, she may never have set foot in Cellmark\u2019s\nlaboratory.Under our case law, that is sufficient to\nresolve this case. \u201c[W]hen the State elected to introduce\u201d the\nsubstance of Cellmark\u2019s report into evidence, the analyst who\ngenerated that report \u201cbecame a witness\u201d whom Williams \u201chad the\nright to confront.\u201d Bullcoming, 564 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 13). As we stated just last year, \u201cOur precedent[s] cannot\nsensibly be read any other way.\u201d Ibid.IIThe plurality\u2019s primary argument to the\ncontrary tries to exploit a limit to the Confrontation Clause\nrecognized in Crawford. \u201cThe Clause,\u201d we cautioned there, \u201cdoes not\nbar the use of testimonial statements for purposes other than\nestablishing the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d 541 U.\u00a0S., at\n59\u201360, n.\u00a09 (citing Tennessee v. Street,471 U.S.\n409, 414 (1985) ). The Illinois Supreme Court relied on that\nstatement in concluding that Lambatos\u2019s testimony was permissible.\nOn that court\u2019s view, \u201cLambatos disclosed the underlying facts from\nCellmark\u2019s report\u201d not for their truth, but \u201cfor the limited\npurpose of explaining the basis for her [expert] opinion,\u201d so that\nthe factfinder could assess that opinion\u2019s value. 238 Ill. 2d 125,\n150, 939 N.E.2d 268, 282 (2010). The plurality wraps itself in that\nholding, similarly asserting that Lambatos\u2019s recitation of\nCellmark\u2019s findings, when viewed through the prism of state\nevidence law, was not introduced to establish \u201cthe truth of any\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. matter concerning [the] Cellmark\u201d report. Ante, at\n16; see ante, at 2, 24\u201325. But five Justices agree, in two opinions\nreciting the same reasons, that this argument has no merit:\nLambatos\u2019s statements about Cellmark\u2019s report went to its truth,\nand the State could not rely on her status as an expert to\ncircumvent the Confrontation Clause\u2019s requirements. See ante, at\n2\u20138 (opinion of Thomas, J.).To see why, start with the kind of case\nCrawford had in mind. In acknowledging the not-for-the-truth\ncarveout from the Clause, the Court cited Tennessee v. Street as\nexemplary. See Crawford, 541 U.\u00a0S., at 59\u201360, n.\u00a09.\nThere, Street claimed that his stationhouse confession of murder\nwas a sham: A police officer, he charged, had read aloud his\nalleged accomplice\u2019s confession and forced him to repeat it. To\nhelp rebut that defense, the State introduced the other confession\ninto the record, so the jury could see how it differed from\nStreet\u2019s. This Court rejected Street\u2019s Confrontation Clause claim\nbecause the State had offered the out-of-court statement not to\nprove \u201cthe truth of [the accomplice\u2019s] assertions\u201d about the\nmurder, but only to disprove Street\u2019s claim of how the police\nelicited his confession. Street, 471 U.\u00a0S., at 413. Otherwise\nsaid, the truth of the admitted statement was utterly immaterial;\nthe only thing that mattered was that the statement (whether true\nor false) varied from Street\u2019s.The situation could not be more different when a\nwitness, expert or otherwise, repeats an out-of-court statement as\nthe basis for a conclusion, because the statement\u2019s utility is then\ndependent on its truth. If the statement is true, then the\nconclusion based on it is probably true; if not, not. So to\ndetermine the validity of the witness\u2019s conclusion, the factfinder\nmust assess the truth of the out-of-court statement on which it\nrelies. That is why the principal modern treatise on evidence\nvariously calls the idea that such \u201cbasis evidence\u201d comes in not\nfor its truth, but only to help the factfinder evaluate an expert\u2019s\nopin- ion \u201cvery weak,\u201d \u201cfactually implausible,\u201d \u201cnonsense,\u201d and\n\u201csheer fiction.\u201d D. Kaye, D. Bernstein, & J. Mnookin, The New\nWigmore: Expert Evidence \u00a74.10.1, pp. 196\u2013197 (2d ed. 2011); id.,\n\u00a74.11.6, at 24 (Supp. 2012). \u201cOne can sympathize,\u201d notes that\ntreatise, \u201cwith a court\u2019s desire to permit the disclosure of basis\nevidence that is quite probably reliable, such as a routine\nanalysis of a drug, but to pretend that it is not being introduced\nfor the truth of its contents strains credibility.\u201d Id., \u00a74.10.1,\nat 198 (2d ed. 2011); see also, e.g., People v. Goldstein, 6 N.Y.3d\n119, 128, 843 N.E.2d 727, 732\u2013733 (2005) (\u201cThe distinction between\na statement offered for its truth and a statement offered to shed\nlight on an expert\u2019s opinion is not meaningful\u201d). Unlike in Street,\nadmission of the out-of-court statement in this context has no\npurpose separate from its truth; the factfinder can do nothing with\nit except assess its truth and so the credibility of the conclusion\nit serves to buttress. [1]Consider a prosaic example not involving\nscientific experts. An eyewitness tells a police officer\ninvestigating an assault that the perpetrator had an unusual,\nstar-shaped birthmark over his left eye. The officer arrests a\nperson bearing that birthmark (let\u2019s call him Starr) for committing\nthe offense. And at trial, the officer takes the stand and recounts\njust what the eyewitness told him. Presumably the plurality would\nagree that such testimony violates the Confrontation Clause unless\nthe eyewitness is unavailable and the defendant had a prior\nopportunity to cross-examine him. Now ask whether anything changes\nif the officer couches his testimony in the following way: \u201cI\nconcluded that Starr was the assailant because a reliable\neyewitness told me that the assailant had a star-shaped birthmark\nand, look, Starr has one just like that.\u201d Surely that framing would\nmake no constitutional difference, even though the eyewitness\u2019s\nstatement now explains the basis for the officer\u2019s conclusion. It\nremains the case that the prosecution is attempting to introduce a\ntestimonial statement that has no relevance to the proceedings\napart from its truth\u2014and that the defendant cannot cross-examine\nthe person who made it. Allowing the admission of this evidence\nwould end-run the Confrontation Clause, and make a parody of its\nstrictures.And that example, when dressed in scientific\nclothing, is no different from this case. The Cellmark report\nidentified the rapist as having a particular DNA profile (think of\nit as the quintessential birthmark). The Confrontation Clause\nprevented the State from introducing that report into evidence\nexcept by calling to the stand the person who prepared it. See\nMelendez-Diaz, 557 U.\u00a0S., at 310\u2013311; Bullcoming, 564\nU.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 2). So the State tried another\nroute\u2014introducing the substance of the report as part and parcel of\nan expert witness\u2019s conclusion. In effect, Lambatos testified (like\nthe police officer above): \u201cI concluded that Williams was the\nrapist because Cellmark, an accredited and trustworthy laboratory,\nsays that the rapist has a particular DNA profile and, look,\nWilliams has an identical one.\u201d And here too, that form of\ntestimony should change nothing. The use of the Cellmark statement\nremained bound up with its truth, and the statement came into\nevidence without any opportunity for Williams to cross-examine the\nperson who made it. So if the plurality were right, the State would\nhave a ready method to bypass the Constitution (as much as in my\nhypothetical case); a wink and a nod, and the Confrontation Clause\nwould not pose a bar to forensic evidence.The plurality tries to make plausible its\nnot-for-the-truth rationale by rewriting Lambatos\u2019s testimony about\nthe Cellmark report. According to the plurality, Lambatos merely\n\u201cassumed\u201d that Cellmark\u2019s DNA profile came from L.\u00a0J.\u2019s\nvaginal swabs, accepting for the sake of argument the prosecutor\u2019s\npremise. Ante, at 18. But that is incorrect. Nothing in Lambatos\u2019s\ntestimony indicates that she was making an assumption or\nconsidering a hypothesis. To the contrary, Lambatos affirmed,\nwithout qualification, that the Cellmark report showed a \u201cmale DNA\nprofile found in semen from the vaginal swabs of [L.\u00a0J.].\u201d\nApp. 56. Had she done otherwise, this case would be different.\nThere was nothing wrong with Lambatos\u2019s testifying that two DNA\nprofiles\u2014the one shown in the Cellmark report and the one derived\nfrom Williams\u2019s blood\u2014matched each other; that was a\nstraightforward application of Lambatos\u2019s expertise. Similarly,\nLambatos could have added that if the Cellmark report resulted from\nscientifically sound testing of L.\u00a0J.\u2019s vaginal swab, then it\nwould link Williams to the assault. What Lambatos could not do was\nwhat she did: indicate that the Cellmark report was produced in\nthis way by saying that L.\u00a0J.\u2019s vaginal swab contained DNA\nmatching Williams\u2019s. [2] By\ntestifying in that manner, Lambatos became just like the surrogate\nwitness in Bullcoming\u2014a person knowing nothing about \u201cthe\nparticular test and testing process,\u201d but vouching for them\nregardless. 564 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 12). We have held\nthat the Confrontation Clause requires something more.The plurality also argues that Lambatos\u2019s\ncharacterization of the Cellmark report did not violate the\nConfrontation Clause because the case \u201cinvolve[d] a bench trial.\u201d\nAnte, at 19 (emphasis deleted). I welcome the plurality\u2019s\nconcession that the Clause might forbid presenting Lambatos\u2019s\nstatement to a jury, see ante, at 18\u201319; it indicates that the\nplurality realizes that her testimony went beyond an \u201cassumption.\u201d\nBut the presence of a judge does not transform the constitutional\nquestion. In applying the Confrontation Clause, we have never\nbefore considered relevant the decisionmaker\u2019s identity. See, e.g.,\nDavis v. Washington,547 U.S.\n813(2006) . And this case would be a poor place to begin.\nLambatos\u2019s description of the Cellmark report was offered for its\ntruth because that is all such \u201cbasis evidence\u201d can be offered for;\nas described earlier, the only way the factfinder could consider\nwhether that statement supported her opinion (that the DNA on\nL.\u00a0J.\u2019s swabs came from Williams) was by assessing the\nstatement\u2019s truth. See supra, at 9\u201312. That is so, as a simple\nmatter of logic, whether the factfinder is a judge or a jury. And\nthus, in either case, admission of the statement, without the\nopportunity to cross-examine, violates the Confrontation Clause.\nSee ante, at 3\u20134, n.\u00a01 (opinion of Thomas, J.).In saying that much, I do not doubt that a judge\ntypi- cally will do better than a jury in excluding such\ninadmissible evidence from his decisionmaking process. Perhaps the\njudge did so here; perhaps, as the plurality thinks, he un-\nderstood that he could not consider Lambatos\u2019s repre- sentation\nabout the Cellmark report, and found that other, \u201ccircumstantial\nevidence\u201d established \u201cthe source of the sample that Cellmark\ntested\u201d and \u201cthe reliability of the Cellmark profile.\u201d See ante, at\n22\u201323. Some indications are to the contrary: In delivering his\nverdict, the judge never referred to the circumstantial evidence\nthe plurality marshals, but instead focused only on Lambatos\u2019s\ntestimony. See 4 Record JJJ151 (calling Lambatos \u201cthe best DNA\nwitness I have ever heard\u201d and referring to Williams as \u201cthe guy\nwhose DNA, according to the evidence from the experts, is in the\nsemen recovered from the victim\u2019s vagina\u201d). But I take the\nplurality\u2019s point that when read \u201c[i]n context\u201d the judge\u2019s\nstatements might be \u201cbest understood\u201d as meaning something other\nthan what they appear to say. See ante, at 20, n.\u00a06. Still,\nthat point suggests only that the admission of Lambatos\u2019s statement\nwas harmless\u2014that the judge managed to put it out of mind. After\nall, whether a factfinder is confused by an error is a separate\nquestion from whether an error has occurred. So the plurality\u2019s\nargument does not answer the only question this case presents:\nwhether a constitutional violation happened when Lambatos recited\nthe Cellmark report\u2019s findings. [3]At bottom, the plurality\u2019s not-for-the-truth\nrationale is a simple abdication to state-law labels. Although the\nutility of the Cellmark statement that Lambatos repeated logi-\ncally depended on its truth, the plurality thinks this case decided\nby an Illinois rule holding that the facts underlying an expert\u2019s\nopinion are not admitted for that purpose. See ante, at 14\u201318;\nPeople v. Pasch,152 Ill. 2d 133, 175\u2013177,604 N.E.2d 294, 311 (1992). But we do not typically allow state\nlaw to define federal constitutional requirements. And needless to\nsay (or perhaps not), the Confrontation Clause is a constitutional\nrule like any other. As Justice Thomas observes, even before\nCrawford, we did not allow the Clause\u2019s scope to be \u201cdictated by\nstate or federal evidentiary rules.\u201d See ante, at 2. Indeed, in\nStreet, we independently reviewed whether an out-of-court statement\nwas introduced for its truth\u2014the very question at issue in this\ncase. See 471 U.\u00a0S., at 413\u2013416. And in Crawford, we still\nmore firmly disconnected the Confrontation Clause inquiry from\nstate evidence law, by overruling an approach that looked in part\nto whether an out- of-court statement fell within a \u201c\u00a0\u2018firmly\nrooted hearsay exception.\u2019\u00a0\u201d 541 U.\u00a0S., at 60 (quoting\nRoberts, 448 U.\u00a0S., at 66). That decision made clear that the\nConfrontation Clause\u2019s protections are not coterminous with rules\nof evidence. So the plurality\u2019s state-law-first approach would be\nan about-face.Still worse, that approach would allow\nprosecutors to do through subterfuge and indirection what we\npreviously have held the Confrontation Clause prohibits. Imagine\nfor a moment a poorly trained, incompetent, or dishonest laboratory\nanalyst. (The analyst in Bullcoming, placed on unpaid leave for\nunknown reasons, might qualify.) Under our precedents, the\nprosecutor cannot avoid exposing that analyst to cross-examination\nsimply by introducing his report. See Melendez-Diaz, 557\nU.\u00a0S., at 311. Nor can the prosecutor escape that fate by\noffering the results through the testimony of another analyst from\nthe laboratory. See Bullcoming, 564 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 2). But under the plurality\u2019s approach, the prosecutor could\nchoose the analyst-witness of his dreams (as the judge here said,\n\u201cthe best DNA witness I have ever heard\u201d), offer her as an expert\n(she knows nothing about the test, but boasts impressive degrees),\nand have her provide testimony identical to the best the actual\ntester might have given (\u201cthe DNA extracted from the vaginal swabs\nmatched Sandy Williams\u2019s\u201d)\u2014all so long as a state evidence rule\nsays that the purpose of the testimony is to enable the factfinder\nto assess the expert opinion\u2019s basis. (And this tactic would not be\nconfined to cases involving scientific evidence. As Justice Thomas\npoints out, the prosecutor could similarly substitute experts for\nall kinds of people making out-of-court statements. See ante, at\n7.) The plurality thus would countenance the Constitution\u2019s\ncircumvention. If the Confrontation Clause prevents the State from\ngetting its evidence in through the front door, then the State\ncould sneak it in through the back. What a neat trick\u2014but really,\nwhat a way to run a criminal justice system. No wonder five\nJustices reject it.IIIThe plurality also argues, as a \u201csecond,\nindependent basis\u201d for its decision, that the Cellmark report falls\noutside the Confrontation Clause\u2019s ambit because it is\nnontestimonial. Ante, at 3. The plurality tries out a number of\nsupporting theories, but all in vain: Each one either conflicts\nwith this Court\u2019s precedents or misconstrues this case\u2019s facts.\nJustice Thomas rejects the plurality\u2019s views for similar reasons as\nI do, thus bringing to five the number of Justices who repudiate\nthe plurality\u2019s understanding of what statements count as\ntestimonial. See ante, at 1, 12\u201315. Justice Thomas, however, offers\na rationale of his own for deciding that the Cellmark report is\nnontestimonial. I think his essay works no better. When all is said\nand done, the Cellmark report is a testimonial statement.AAccording to the plurality, we should declare\nthe Cellmark report nontestimonial because \u201cthe use at trial of a\nDNA report prepared by a modern, accredited laboratory \u2018bears\nlittle if any resemblance to the historical practices that the\nConfrontation Clause aimed to eliminate.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Ante, at 33\n(quoting Michigan v. Bryant, 562 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2011)\n(Thomas, J., concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 2)). But we just\nlast year treated as testimonial a forensic report prepared by a\n\u201cmodern, accredited laboratory\u201d; indeed, we declared that the\nreport at issue \u201cfell within the core class of testimonial\nstatements\u201d implicating the Confrontation Clause. Bullcoming, 564\nU.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 16) (internal quotation marks\nomitted); see Brief for New Mexico Department of Health, Scientific\nLaboratory Division as Amicus Curiae in Bullcoming, O. T. 2010, No.\n09\u201310786, p.\u00a01 (discussing accreditation). And although the\nplurality is close, it is not quite ready (or able) to dispense\nwith that decision. See ante, at 29, n.\u00a013 (\u201cExperience might\nyet show that the holdings in [Bullcoming and other post-Crawford]\ncases should be reconsidered\u201d). So the plurality must explain: What\ncould support a distinction between the laboratory analysis there\nand the DNA test in this case? [4]As its first stab, the plurality states that the\nCellmark report was \u201cnot prepared for the primary purpose of\naccusing a targeted individual.\u201d Ante, at 31. Where that test comes\nfrom is anyone\u2019s guess. Justice Thomas rightly shows that it\nderives neither from the text nor from the history of the\nConfrontation Clause. See ante, at 14\u201315 (opinion concurring in\njudgment). And it has no basis in our precedents. We have\npreviously asked whether a statement was made for the primary\npurpose of establishing \u201cpast events potentially relevant to later\ncriminal prosecution\u201d\u2014in other words, for the purpose of providing\nevidence. Davis, 547 U.\u00a0S., at 822; see also Bullcoming, 564\nU.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 14); Bryant, 562 U.\u00a0S., at\n___, ___ (slip op., at 14, 29); Melendez-Diaz, 557 U.\u00a0S., at\n310\u2013311; Crawford, 541 U.\u00a0S., at 51\u201352. None of our cases has\never suggested that, in addition, the statement must be meant to\naccuse a previously identified individual; indeed, in\nMelendez-Diaz, we rejected a related argument that laboratory\n\u201canalysts are not subject to confrontation because they are not\n\u2018accusatory\u2019 witnesses.\u201d 557 U.\u00a0S., at 313.Nor does the plurality give any good reason for\nadopting an \u201caccusation\u201d test. The plurality apparently agrees with\nJustice Breyer that prior to a suspect\u2019s identification, it will be\n\u201cunlikely that a particular researcher has a defendant-related\nmotive to behave dishonestly.\u201d Ante, at 12 (Breyer, J.,\nconcurring); see ante, at 31\u201332 (plurality opinion). But surely the\ntypical problem with laboratory analyses\u2014and the typical focus of\ncross-examination\u2014has to do with careless or incompetent work,\nrather than with personal vendettas. And as to that predominant\nconcern, it makes not a whit of difference whether, at the time of\nthe laboratory test, the police already have a suspect. [5]The plurality next attempts to invoke our\nprecedents holding statements nontestimonial when made \u201cto respond\nto an \u2018ongoing emergency,\u2019\u00a0\u201d rather than to create evidence\nfor trial, Bryant, 562 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 11); here,\nthe plurality insists, the Cellmark report\u2019s purpose was \u201cto catch\na dangerous rapist who was still at large.\u201d Ante, at 31. But that\nis to stretch both our \u201congoing emergency\u201d test and the facts of\nthis case beyond all recognition. We have previously invoked that\ntest to allow statements by a woman who was being assaulted and a\nman who had just been shot. In doing so, we stressed the \u201cinformal\n[and] harried\u201d nature of the statements, Bryant, 562 U.\u00a0S., at\n___ (slip op., at 31)\u2014that they were made as, or \u201cminutes\u201d after,\nid., at ___ (slip op., at 28), the events they described \u201cactually\nhappen[ed],\u201d Davis, 547 U.\u00a0S., at 827 (emphasis deleted), by\n\u201cfrantic\u201d victims of criminal attacks, ibid., to officers trying to\nfigure out \u201cwhat had .\u00a0.\u00a0. occurred\u201d and what threats\nremained, Bryant, 562 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 30)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). On their face, the decisions\nhave nothing to say about laboratory analysts conducting routine\ntests far away from a crime scene. And this case presents a\npeculiarly inapt set of facts for extending those precedents.\nLambatos testified at trial that \u201call reports in this case were\nprepared for this criminal investigation .\u00a0.\u00a0. [a]nd for\nthe purpose of the eventual litigation,\u201d App. 82\u2014in other words,\nfor the purpose of producing evidence, not enabling emergency\nresponders. And that testimony fits the relevant timeline. The\npolice did not send the swabs to Cellmark until November 2008\u2014nine\nmonths after L.\u00a0J.\u2019s rape\u2014and did not receive the results for\nanother four months. See id., at 30\u201334, 51\u201352, 54. That is hardly\nthe typical emergency response.Finally, the plurality offers a host of reasons\nfor why reports like this one are reliable: \u201c[T]here [i]s no\nprospect of fabrication,\u201d ante, at 31 (internal quotation marks\nomitted); multiple technicians may \u201cwork on each DNA profile,\u201d\nante, at 32; and \u201cdefects in a DNA profile may often be detected\nfrom the profile itself,\u201d ibid. See also ante, at 10\u201314 (opinion of\nBreyer, J.). But once again: Been there, done that. In\nMelendez-Diaz, this Court rejected identical arguments, noting\nextensive documentation of \u201c[s]erious deficiencies .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nin the forensic evidence used in criminal trials.\u201d 557 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 319; see supra, at 4\u20135; see also Bullcoming, 564 U.\u00a0S., at\n___, n.\u00a01 (slip op., at 4, n. 1) (citing similar errors in\nlaboratory analysis); Brief for Public Defender Service for the\nDistrict of Columbia et\u00a0al. as Amici Curiae 13 (discussing\n\u201c[s]ystemic problems,\u201d such as sample contamination, sample\nswitching, mislabeling, and fraud, at \u201c\u00a0\u2018flagship\u2019 DNA labs\u201d).\nScientific testing is \u201ctechnical,\u201d to be sure, ante, at 1 (opinion\nof Breyer, J.); but it is only as reliable as the people who\nperform it. That is why a defendant may wish to ask the analyst a\nvariety of questions: How much experience do you have? Have you\never made mistakes in the past? Did you test the right sample? Use\nthe right procedures? Contaminate the sample in any way? Indeed, as\nscientific evidence plays a larger and larger role in criminal\nprosecutions, those inquiries will often be the most important in\nthe case. [6]And Melendez-Diaz made yet a more fundamental\npoint in response to claims of the \u00fcber alles reliability of\nscientific evidence: It is not up to us to decide, ex ante, what\nevidence is trustworthy and what is not. See 557 U.\u00a0S., at\n317\u2013318; see also Bullcoming, 564 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at\n11). That is because the Confrontation Clause prescribes its own\n\u201cprocedure for determining the reliability of testimony in criminal\ntrials.\u201d Crawford, 541 U.\u00a0S., at 67. That procedure is\ncross-examination. And \u201c[d]ispensing with [it] because testimony is\nobviously reliable is akin to dispensing with jury trial because a\ndefendant is obviously guilty.\u201d Id., at 62.So the plurality\u2019s second basis for denying\nWilliams\u2019s right of confrontation also fails. The plurality can\nfind no reason consistent with our precedents for treating the\nCellmark report as nontestimonial. That is because the report is,\nin every conceivable respect, a statement meant to serve as\nevidence in a potential criminal trial. And that simple fact should\nbe sufficient to resolve the question.BJustice Thomas\u2019s unique method of defining\ntestimonial statements fares no better. On his view, the\nConfrontation Clause \u201cregulates only the use of statements bearing\n\u2018indicia of solemnity.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Ante, at 8 (quoting Davis, 547\nU.\u00a0S., at 836\u2013837). And Cellmark\u2019s report, he concludes, does\nnot qualify because it is \u201cneither a sworn nor a certified\ndeclaration of fact.\u201d Ante, at 9. But Justice Thomas\u2019s approach\ngrants constitutional significance to minutia, in a way that can\nonly undermine the Confrontation Clause\u2019s protections.To see the point, start with precedent, because\nthe Court rejected this same kind of argument, as applied to this\nsame kind of document, at around this same time just last year. In\nBullcoming, the State asserted that the forensic report at issue\nwas nontestimonial because\u2014unlike the report in Melendez-Diaz\u2014it\nwas not sworn before a notary public. We responded that applying\nthe Confrontation Clause only to a sworn forensic report \u201cwould\nmake the right to confrontation easily erasable\u201d\u2014next time, the\nlaboratory could file the selfsame report without the oath. 564\nU.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 15). We then held, as noted\nearlier, that \u201c[i]n all material respects,\u201d the forensic report in\nBullcoming matched the one in Melendez-Diaz. 564 U.\u00a0S., at ___\n(slip op., at 15); see supra, at 5. First, a law enforcement\nofficer provided evidence to a state laboratory assisting in police\ninvestigations. See 564 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 15).\nSecond, the analyst tested the evidence and \u201cprepared a certificate\nconcerning the result[s].\u201d Ibid. Third, the certificate was\n\u201cformalized in a signed document .\u00a0.\u00a0. headed a\n\u2018report.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Ibid. (some internal quotation marks omitted).\nThat was enough.Now compare that checklist of \u201cmaterial\u201d\nfeatures to the report in this case. The only differences are that\nCellmark is a private laboratory under contract with the State\n(which no one thinks relevant), and that the report is not labeled\na \u201ccertificate.\u201d That amounts to (maybe) a nickel\u2019s worth of\ndifference: The similarities in form, function, and purpose dwarf\nthe distinctions. See supra, at 5\u20136. Each report is an official and\nsigned record of laboratory test results, meant to establish a\ncertain set of facts in legal proceedings. Neither looks any more\n\u201cformal\u201d than the other; neither is any more formal than the other.\nSee ibid. The variances are no more (probably less) than would be\nfound if you compared different law schools\u2019 transcripts or\ndifferent companies\u2019 cash flow statements or different States\u2019\nbirth certificates. The difference in labeling\u2014a \u201ccertificate\u201d in\none case, a \u201creport of laboratory examination\u201d in the other\u2014is not\nof constitutional dimension.Indeed, Justice Thomas\u2019s approach, if accepted,\nwould turn the Confrontation Clause into a constitutional\ngeegaw\u2014nice for show, but of little value. The prosecution could\navoid its demands by using the right kind of forms with the right\nkind of language. (It would not take long to devise the magic words\nand rules\u2014principally, never call anything a \u201ccertificate.\u201d) [7] And still worse: The new\nconventions, precisely by making out-of-court statements less\n\u201csolem[n],\u201d ante, at 1, would also make them less reliable\u2014and so\nturn the Confrontation Clause upside down. See Crawford, 541\nU.\u00a0S., at 52\u201353, n.\u00a03 (\u201cWe find it implausible that a\nprovision which concededly condemned trial by sworn ex\u00a0parte\naffidavit thought trial by unsworn ex\u00a0parte affidavit\nperfectly OK\u201d). It is not surprising that no other Member of the\nCourt has adopted this position. To do so, as Justice Thomas\nrightly says of the plurality\u2019s decision, would be to \u201cdiminis[h]\nthe Confrontation Clause\u2019s protection\u201d in \u201cthe very cases in which\nthe accused should \u2018enjoy the right .\u00a0.\u00a0. to be\nconfronted with the witnesses against him.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Ante, at 16.IVBefore today\u2019s decision, a prosecutor wishing to\nadmit the results of forensic testing had to produce the technician\nresponsible for the analysis. That was the result of not one, but\ntwo decisions this Court issued in the last three years. But that\nclear rule is clear no longer. The five Justices who control the\noutcome of today\u2019s case agree on very little. Among them, though,\nthey can boast of two accomplishments. First, they have approved\nthe introduction of testimony at Williams\u2019s trial that the\nConfrontation Clause, rightly understood, clearly prohibits.\nSecond, they have left significant confusion in their wake. What\ncomes out of four Justices\u2019 desire to limit Melendez-Diaz and\nBullcoming in whatever way possible, combined with one Justice\u2019s\none-justice view of those holdings, is\u2014to be frank\u2014who knows what.\nThose decisions apparently no longer mean all that they say. Yet no\none can tell in what way or to what extent they are altered because\nno proposed limitation commands the support of a majority.The better course in this case would have been\nsimply to follow Melendez-Diaz and Bullcoming. Precedent-based\ndecisionmaking provides guidance to lower court judges and\npredictability to litigating parties. Today\u2019s plurality and\nconcurring opinions, and the uncertainty they sow, bring into\nrelief that judicial method\u2019s virtues. I would decide this case\nconsistently with, and for the reasons stated by, Melendez-Diaz and\nBullcoming. And until a majority of this Court reverses or confines\nthose decisions, I would understand them as continuing to govern,\nin every particular, the admission of forensic evidence.I respectfully dissent.Notes1In responding to this\nreasoning, the plurality confirms it. According to the plurality,\nbasis evidence supports the \u201ccredibility of the expert\u2019s opinion\u201d\nby showing that he has relied on, and drawn logical inferences\nfrom, sound \u201cfactual premises.\u201d Ante, at 24. Quite right. And that\nprocess involves assessing such premises\u2019 truth: If they are, as\nthe majority puts it, \u201cunsupported by other evidence in the record\u201d\nor otherwise baseless, they will not \u201callay [a factfinder\u2019s] fears\u201d\nabout an \u201cexpert\u2019s reasoning.\u201d Ante, at 24\u201325. I could not have\nsaid it any better.2The plurality suggests\nthat Lambatos\u2019s testimony is merely a modern, streamlined way of\nanswering hypothetical questions and therefore raises no\nconstitutional issue, see ante, at 2, 13\u201315; similarly, the\nplurality contends that the difference between what Lambatos said\nand what I would allow involves only \u201cslightly revis[ing]\u201d her\ntestimony and so can be of no consequence, see ante, at 18,\nn.\u00a03. But the statement \u201cif X is true, then Y follows\u201d differs\nmaterially\u2014and constitutionally\u2014from the statement \u201cY is true\nbecause X is true (according to Z).\u201d The former statement is merely\na logical proposition, whose validity the defendant can contest by\nquestioning the speaker. And then, assum-ing the prosecutor tries\nto prove the statement\u2019s premise through some other witness, the\ndefendant can rebut that effort through cross-examination. By\ncontrast, the latter statement as well contains a factual\nallegation (that X is true), which the defendant can only\neffectively challenge by confronting the person who made it (Z).\nThat is why recognizing the difference between these two forms of\ntestimony is not to insist on an archaism or a formality, but to\nensure, in line with the Constitution, that defendants have the\nability to confront their accusers. And if prosecutors can easily\nconform their conduct to that constitutional directive, as the\nplurality suggests, so much the better: I would not have thought it\na ground of complaint that the Confrontation Clause, properly\nunderstood, manages to protect defendants without overly burdening\nthe State.3The plurality asserts\n(without citation) that I am \u201creach[ing] the truly remarkable\nconclusion that the wording of Lambatos\u2019 testimony confused the\ntrial judge,\u201d ante, at 19, and then spends three pages explaining\nwhy that conclusion is wrong, see ante, at 19\u201321. But the plurality\nis responding to an argument of its own imagining, because I reach\nno such conclusion. As I just stated, the trial judge might well\nhave ignored Lambatos\u2019s statement about the Cellmark report and\nrelied on other evidence to conclude that \u201cthe Cellmark profile was\nderived from the sample taken from the victim,\u201d ante, at 19. All I\nam saying is that the admission of that statement violated the\nConfrontation Clause even if the judge ultimately put it aside,\nbecause it came into evidence for nothing other than its truth. See\nsupra, at 9\u201312. Similarly, the plurality claims (still without\ncitation) that I think the other evidence about the Cellmark report\ninsufficient, see ante, at 21. But once again, the plurality must\nbe reading someone else\u2019s opinion. I express no view on sufficiency\nof the evidence because it is irrelevant to the Confrontation\nClause issue we took this case to decide. It is the plurality that\nwrongly links the two, spending another five pages trumpeting the\nstrength of the Cellmark report, see ante, at 22\u201324, 32\u201333. But the\nplurality cannot properly decide whether a Confrontation Clause\nviolation occurred at Williams\u2019s trial by determining that Williams\nwas guilty. The American criminal justice system works the opposite\nway: determining guilt by holding trials in accord with\nconstitutional requirements.4Justice Breyer does not\nattempt to distinguish our precedents, opting simply to adhere to\n\u201cthe dissenting view set forth in Melendez-Diaz and Bullcoming.\u201d\nSee ante, at 8 (concurring opinion). He principally worries that\nunder those cases, a State will have to call to the witness stand\n\u201c[s]ix to twelve or more technicians\u201d who have worked on a report.\nSee ante, at 5; see also ante, at 3, 16\u201318. But none of our\ncases\u2014including this one\u2014has presented the question of how many\nanalysts must testify about a given report. (That may suggest that\nin most cases a lead analyst is readily identifiable.) The problem\nin the cases\u2014again, including this one\u2014is that no analyst came\nforward to testify. In the event that some future case presents the\nmultiple-technician issue, the Court can focus on \u201cthe broader\n\u2018limits\u2019 question\u201d that troubles Justice Breyer, ante, at 7. But\nthe mere existence of that question is no reason to wrongly decide\nthe case before us\u2014which, it bears repeating, involved the\ntestimony of not twelve or six or three or one, but zero Cellmark\nanalysts.5Neither can the plurality\ngain any purchase from the idea that a DNA profile is not\n\u201cinherently inculpatory\u201d because it \u201ctends to exculpate all but one\nof the more than 7 billion people in the world today.\u201d Ante, at 3;\nsee ante, at 32. All evidence shares this feature: the more\ninculpatory it is of a single person, the more exculpatory it is of\nthe rest of the world. The one is but the flipside of the other.\nBut no one has ever before suggested that this logical corollary\nprovides a reason to ignore the Constitution\u2019s efforts to ensure\nthe reliability of evidence.6Both the plurality and\nJustice Breyer warn that if we require analysts to testify, we will\nencourage prosecutors to forgo DNA evidence in favor of less\nreliable eyewitness testimony and so \u201cincrease the risk of\nconvicting the innocent.\u201d Ante, at 13 (Breyer, J., concurring); see\nante, at 3\u20134 (plurality opinion). Neither opinion provides any\nevidence, even by way of anecdote, for that view, and I doubt any\nexists. DNA evidence is usually the prosecutor\u2019s most powerful\nweapon, and a prosecutor is unlikely to relinquish it just because\nhe must bring the right analyst to the stand. Consider what\nLambatos told the factfinder here: The DNA in L.\u00a0J.\u2019s vaginal\nswabs matched Williams\u2019s DNA and would match only \u201c1 in 8.7\nquadrillion black, 1 in 390 quadrillion white, or1 in 109\nquadrillion Hispanic unrelated individuals.\u201d App. 56\u201357. No\neyewitness testimony could replace that evidence. I note as well\nthat the Innocence Network\u2014a group particularly knowledgeable about\nthe kinds of evidence that produce erroneous convictions\u2014disagrees\nwith the plurality\u2019s and Justice Breyer\u2019s view. It argues here that\n\u201c[c]onfrontation of the analyst . . . is essential to permit proper\nadversarial testing\u201d and so to decrease the risk of convicting the\ninnocent. Brieffor the Innocence Network as Amicus Curiae 3,\n7.7Justice Thomas asserts\nthere is no need to worry, because \u201cthe Confrontation Clause\nreaches bad-faith attempts to evade the formalized process.\u201d Ante,\nat 10; see ante, at 9, n.\u00a05. I hope he is right. But Justice\nThomas provides scant guidance on how to conduct this novel inquiry\ninto motive.",
