    "text": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES_________________No. 20\u201318_________________ARTHUR GREGORY LANGE, PETITIONERv.CALIFORNIAon writ of certiorari to the court of appeal\nof california, first appellate district[June 23, 2021]Chief Justice Roberts, with whom Justice Alito\njoins, concurring in the judgment.Suppose a police officer on patrol responds to a\nreport of a man assaulting a teenager. Arriving at the scene, the\nofficer sees the teenager vainly trying to ward off the assailant.\nThe officer attempts to place the assailant under arrest, but he\ntakes off on foot. He leads the officer on a chase over several\nblocks as the officer yells for him to stop. With the officer\nclosing in, the suspect leaps over a fence and then stands on a\nhome\u2019s front yard. He claims it\u2019s his home and tells the officer to\nstay away. What is the officer to do?The Fourth Amendment and our precedent\u2014not to\nmention common sense\u2014provide a clear answer: The officer can enter\nthe property to complete the arrest he lawfully initiated outside\nit. But the Court today has a different take. Holding that flight,\non its own, can never justify a warrantless entry into a home\n(including its curtilage), the Court requires that the officer: (1)\nstop and consider whether the suspect\u2014if apprehended\u2014would be\ncharged with a misdemeanor or a felony, and (2) tally up other\n\u201cexigencies\u201d thatmightbe present or arise,ante, at\n1, 4, before (3) deciding whether he can complete the arrest or\nmust instead seek a warrant\u2014one that, in all likelihood, will not\narrive for hours. Meanwhile, the suspect may stroll into the home\nand then dash out the back door. Or, for all the officer knows, get\na gun and take aim from inside.The Constitution does not demand this absurd and\ndangerous result. We should not impose it. As our precedent makes\nclear, hot pursuit is not merely a setting in which other exigent\ncircumstances justifying warrantless entry might emerge. It is\nitself an exigent circumstance. And we have never held that whether\nan officer may enter a home to complete an arrest turns on what the\nfleeing individual was suspected of doing before he took off, let\nalone whether that offense would later be charged as a misdemeanor\nor felony. It is the flight, not the underlying offense, that has\nalways been understood to justify the general rule: \u201cPolice\nofficers may enter premises without a warrant when they are in hot\npursuit of a fleeing suspect.\u201dKentuckyv.King,563 U.S.\n452, 460 (2011). The Court errs by departing from that\nwell-established rule.IAThe Fourth Amendment protects \u201c[t]he right of\nthe people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and\neffects, against unreasonable searches and seizures\u201d and provides\nthat \u201cno Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause.\u201d While the\nAmendment does not specify when a warrant must be obtained, we have\ntypically required that officers secure one before entering a home\nto execute a search or seizure.King, 563 U.\u00a0S., at\n459. We have also, however, recognized exceptions to that\nrequirement \u201cbecause the ultimate touchstone of the Fourth\nAmendment is \u2018reasonableness.\u2019\u00a0\u201dBrigham Cityv.Stuart,547 U.S.\n398, 403 (2006).In some instances the Court has determined that\nthis question of reasonableness can be decided by application of a\nrule for a particular type of case.Mitchellv.Wisconsin, 588 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___, n. 2 (2019) (plurality\nopinion) (slip op., at 9, n.\u00a02); seeIllinoisv.McArthur,531 U.S.\n326, 330 (2001) (\u201c[T]his Court has interpreted the Amendment as\nestablishing rules and presumptions.\u201d). This approach reflects our\nrecognition of the need \u201cto provide clear guidance to law\nenforcement.\u201dRileyv.California,573 U.S.\n373, 398 (2014). We strive to \u201cdraw standards sufficiently\nclear and simple to be applied with a fair prospect of surviving\njudicial second-guessing months and years after an arrest or search\nis made.\u201dAtwaterv.Lago Vista,532 U.S.\n318, 347 (2001).We have, for example, established general rules\ngiving effect to the \u201cwell-recognized exception [that] applies when\nthe exigencies of the situation make the needs of law enforcement\nso compelling that [a] warrantless search is objectively reasonable\nunder the Fourth Amendment.\u201dKing, 563 U.\u00a0S., at 460\n(some alterations in original; internal quotation marks omitted).\nIn fact, \u201cour exigency case law is full of general rules\u201d that\nprovide \u201cguidance on how police should handle [such] cases.\u201dMitchell, 588 U.\u00a0S., at ___, n. 3 (slip op., at 9,\nn.\u00a03) (internal quotation marks omitted). These rules allow\nwarrantless entry into the home when necessary to \u201cprotect\nindividuals who are threatened with imminent harm, or prevent the\nimminent destruction of evidence.\u201dCarpenterv.United\nStates, 585 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___\u2013___ (2018) (slip op., at\n21\u201322).Or\u2014relevant here\u2014\u201cto pursue a fleeing suspect.\u201dId., at ___ (slip op., at 21).We take a case-by-case approach in deciding\nwhether a search or seizure was conducted in reaction to an exigent\ncircumstance, such as whether an officer had an objective basis to\n\u201cfear the imminent destruction of evidence.\u201dBirchfieldv.North Dakota, 579 U.S. 438, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 15).\nBut once faced with an exigency, our rule is clear: officers are\n\u201cnot bound to learn anything more or wait any longer before going\nin.\u201dUnited Statesv.Banks, 540 U.S. 31, 40\n(2003).Today, the Court holds that hot pursuit merely\nsets the table for other exigencies that may emerge to justify\nwarrantless entry, such as imminent harm. This comes as a surprise.\nFor decades we have consistently recognized pursuit of a fleeing\nsuspect as an exigency, one that on its own justifies warrantless\nentry into a home.Almost a half century ago inUnited\nStatesv.Santana,427 U.S.\n38(1976), we considered whether hot pursuit supports\nwarrantless home entry. We held that such entry was justified when\nSantana \u201cretreat[ed] into her house\u201d after a drug transaction upon\nhearing law enforcement \u201cshout[\u00a0] \u2018police\u2019\u00a0\u201d and seeing\nthem \u201cdisplay[\u00a0] their identification.\u201dId., at 40,\n42.As we explained, \u201ca suspect may not defeat an arrest\nwhich has been set in motion in a public place .\u00a0.\u00a0. by\nthe expedient of escaping to a private place.\u201dId., at 43.\nOur interpretation of the Fourth Amendment did not hinge on whether\nthe offense that precipitated her withdrawal was a felony or a\nmisdemeanor. SeeStantonv.Sims,571 U.S.\n3, 9 (2013) (per curiam).We have repeatedly and consistently reaffirmed\nthat hot pursuit is itself an exigent circumstance. See,e.g.,Carpenter, 585 U.\u00a0S., at ____ (slip op.,\nat 21) (\u201c[E]xigencies include the need to pursue a fleeing\nsuspect.\u201d);Collinsv.Virginia, 584 U.\u00a0S. ___,\n___ (2018) (slip op., at 12) (distinguishing prior case approving\nwarrantless entry onto the curtilage as best sounding in \u201chot\npursuit\u201d);Birchfield, 579 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at\n15) (exception for exigent circumstances authorizes \u201cthe\nwarrantless entry of private property .\u00a0.\u00a0. when police\nare in hot pursuit of a fleeing suspect\u201d);King, 563\nU.\u00a0S., at 460 (\u201cPolice officers may enter premises without a\nwarrant when they are in hot pursuit of a fleeing suspect.\u201d);Brigham City, 547 U.\u00a0S., at 403 (\u201cWe have held, for\nexample, that law enforcement officers may make a warrantless entry\nonto private property .\u00a0.\u00a0. to engage in \u2018hot pursuit\u2019 of\na fleeing suspect.\u201d (citations omitted));Steagaldv.United States,451 U.S.\n204, 221 (1981) (\u201c[W]arrantless entry of a home would be\njustified if the police were in \u2018hot pursuit\u2019 of a fugitive.\u201d); see\nalsoMitchell, 588 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (Sotomayor, J.,\ndissenting) (slip op., at 11) (\u201c\u00a0\u2018hot pursuit\u2019 of a fleeing\nsuspect\u201d qualifies as an exigency);Missouriv.McNeely,569 U.S.\n141, 176\u2013177 (2013) (Thomas, J., dissenting) (same).These cases, it bears repeating, have not viewed\nhot pursuit as merely the background against whichotherexigencies justifying warrantless entry might arise. See,e.g.,Carpenter, 585 U.\u00a0S., at ___\u2013___ (slip\nop., at 21\u201322) (identifying destruction of evidence, emergency aid,andhot pursuit as separate exigencies);Birchfield,\n579 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 15) (same);McNeely,\n569 U.\u00a0S., at 148\u2013149 (opinion of the Court) (same);King, 563 U.\u00a0S., at 460 (same);Brigham City,\n547 U.\u00a0S., at 403 (same); see alsoMitchell, 588\nU.\u00a0S., at ___ (Sotomayor, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 11)\n(same). And our decisions do not dismiss the existence of an\nexigency\u2014including hot pursuit\u2014based on the underlying offense that\nprecipitated law enforcement action, even if known. To the\ncontrary, until today, we have explicitly rejected invitations to\ndo so. SeeBrigham City, 547 U.\u00a0S., at 405 (dismissing\ndefendants\u2019 contention that offenses at issue were \u201cnot serious\nenough\u201d to justify reliance on the emergency aid doctrine);Michiganv.Fisher,558 U.S.\n45, 47 (2009) (per curiam); see alsoAtwater, 532\nU.\u00a0S., at 354 (rejecting exception for \u201cvery minor criminal\noffense[s]\u201d to rule allowing warrantless arrests).The Court displays little patience for this\nprecedent. With regard toSantana, the Court concedes that\n\u201cwe framed our holding in broad[\u00a0] terms.\u201dAnte, at 7.\nYet it narrows those terms based on rationales that played no role\nin the decision. The Court then brushes off our slew of cases\nreaffirmingSantana\u2019s broad holding as nothing more than\n\u201cdicta.\u201dAnte, at 7. I would not override decades of\nguidance to law enforcement in favor of a new rule that provides no\nguidance at all.BA proper consideration of the interests at\nstake confirms the position our precedent amply supports. Pursuit\nimplicates substantial government interests, regardless of the\noffense precipitating the flight. It is the flight, not the\nunderlying offense, that justifies the entry.At the start, every hot pursuit implicates the\ngovernment interest in ensuring compliance with law enforcement.Californiav.Hodari D.,499\nU.S. 621, 627 (1991). Flight is a direct attempt to evade\narrest and thereby frustrate our \u201csociety\u2019s interest in having its\nlaws obeyed.\u201dTerryv.Ohio,392 U.S.\n1, 26 (1968). Disregarding an order to yield to law enforcement\nauthority cannot be dismissed with a shrug of the shoulders simply\nbecause the underlying offense is regarded as \u201cinnocuous,\u201dante, at 10. As the many state courts to approve of\nwarrantless entry in hot pursuit have reminded us, \u201c[l]aw\nenforcement is not a child\u2019s game of prisoners base, or a contest,\nwith apprehension and conviction depending upon whether the officer\nor defendant is the fleetest of foot.\u201dCommonwealthv.Jewett, 471 Mass. 624, 634, 31 N.\u00a0E.\u00a03d 1079, 1089\n(2015) (quotingStatev.Ricci, 144 N.\u00a0H. 241,\n245, 739 A.2d 404, 408 (1999)).Flight also always involves the \u201cparamount\u201d\ngovernment interest in public safety.Scottv.Harris,550 U.S.\n372, 383 (2007); seeHodari D., 499 U.\u00a0S., at 627\n(\u201cStreet pursuits always place the public at some risk, and\ncompliance with police orders to stop should therefore be\nencouraged.\u201d). A fleeing suspect \u201cintentionally place[s] himself\nand the public in danger.\u201dScott, 550 U.\u00a0S., at 384.\nVehicular pursuits, in particular, are often catastrophic. See\nDept. of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, B. Reaves, Police\nVehicle Pursuits, 2012\u20132013, p. 6 (May 2017) (average of about one\ndeath per day in the United States from vehicle pursuits from 1996\nto 2015). Affording suspects the opportunity to evade arrest by\nwinning the race rewards flight and encourages dangerous\nbehavior.And the problems do not end there because hot\npursuit often gives rise to multiple other exigencies, such as\ndestruction of evidence, violence, and escape. The Court\nacknowledges this reality, but then posits that not \u201ceverycase of misdemeanor flight poses such dangers.\u201dAnte, at 10\n(emphasis added). Of course not. But we have never required such a\nlevel of certainty before crafting a general rule that law\nenforcement can follow. For example, inWashingtonv.Chrisman,455 U.S. 1(1982), we held that an officer may accompany an arrestee into his\nresidence without any showing of exigency and regardless of the\n\u201cnature of the offense for which the arrest was made,\u201d because\nthere \u201cis no way for an officer to predict reliably how a\nparticular subject will react to arrest\u201d and \u201cthe possibility that\nan arrested person will attempt to escape if not properly\nsupervised is obvious.\u201dId., at 6\u20137. InMichiganv.Summers,452 U.S.\n692(1981), we concluded that, although \u201cno special danger to\nthe police\u201d was suggested by the evidence in the record, the\nexecution of a search warrant merited a categorical rule allowing\ndetention of present individuals because it was the \u201ckind of\ntransaction\u201d that could give rise to other exigencies.Id.,\nat 702. And inUnited Statesv.Robinson,414 U.S.\n218(1973), we held that the search incident to arrest\nexception applies to all arrests regardless \u201cwhat a court may later\ndecide was the probability in a particular arrest situation that\nweapons or evidence would in fact be found,\u201d because arrests\nrequire \u201cquickad hocjudgment[s].\u201dId., at 235.Such concerns are magnified here. The act of\npursuing a fleeing suspect makes simultaneously assessing which\nother exigencies might arise especially difficult to ascertain \u201con\nthe spur (and in the heat) of the moment.\u201dAtwater, 532\nU.\u00a0S., at 347. The Court disputes this proposition,ante,at 11, n.\u00a03, but the difficulty of discerning\nhidden weapons or drugs on a suspect running or driving away seems\nclear to us.The risks to officer safety posed by the Court\u2019s\nsuggestion that an officer simply abandon pursuit and await a\nwarrant are severe. We are warned in this case that \u201cattempting\nwarrant service for an unknown suspect in an unknown home at night\nis flat dangerous.\u201d Brief for Sonoma County District Attorney\u2019s\nOffice et al. asAmici Curiae33. Whether at night or during\nthe day, the officer is obviously vulnerable to those inside the\nhome while awaiting a warrant, including danger from a suspect who\nhas already demonstrated himself to be undeterred by police orders.\nSee,e.g.,Thompsonv.Florence, 2019 WL\n3220051, *4 (ND Ala., July 17, 2019) (at fleeing suspect\u2019s urging,\nresident grabbed a handgun);Statev.Davis,\n2000\u2013278, p. 5 (La. App. 5 Cir. 8/29/00), 768 So. 2d 201, 206\n(fleeing suspect \u201creached for a handgun\u201d inside home).Even if the area outside the home remains\ntranquil, the suspect inside is free to destroy evidence or\ncontinue his escape. Flight is obviously suggestive of these\nrecognized exigencies, which could materialize promptly once the\nofficer is compelled to abandon pursuit. The destruction of\nevidence can take as little as \u201c15 or 20 seconds,\u201dBanks,\n540 U.\u00a0S., at 40; and a suspect can dash out the back door\njust as quickly, while the officer must wait outside. Forcing the\nofficer to wait and predict whether such exigencieswilloccur before entry is in practice no different from forcing the\nofficer to wait for these exigenciestooccur.Indeed, from the perspective of the officer,\nmany instances of flight leading to further wrongdoing are the sort\nof \u201cflight alone\u201d cases the Court deems harmless,ante, at\n11, n.\u00a03. Despite the Court\u2019s suggestion to the contrary,\nexamples of \u201cflight alone\u201d generating exigencies difficult to\nidentify in advance are not hard to find. See,e.g.Statev.Lam, 2013-Ohio-505, 989 N.E.2d 100, 101\u2013102\n(App.) (warrantless entry in hot pursuit of someone who committed\nturn signal violation revealed heroin on suspect and suggested\nattempt to flush drugs down the toilet);Statev.Mitchem, 2014-Ohio-2366, 2014 WL 2565680, *1 (App., June 4,\n2014) (suspect who committed trespass, fled from the police into\nprivate driveway, and stated to officers \u201c[Y]ou can\u2019t touch me, I\u2019m\nat my house,\u201d turned out to have a gun). (And, as we will see, it\nis apparently hard to decide which cases qualify as \u201cflight alone\u201d\ncases, seeinfra, at 16.)If the suspect continues to flee through the\nhouse, while the officer must wait, even the quickest warrant will\nbe far too late. Only in the best circumstances can one be obtained\nin under an hour, see Brief for Respondent 33, and it usually takes\nmuch longer than that, see Brief for Los Angeles County Police\nChiefs\u2019 Association asAmicus Curiae24\u201325. Even electronic\nwarrants may involve \u201ctime-consuming formalities.\u201dMcNeely,\n569 U.\u00a0S., at 155. And some States typically require that a\nwarrant application be in writing, see,e.g., Colo. Rev.\nStat. \u00a716\u20133\u2013303 (2020), or that the applicant appear in person\nbefore a judge, see,e.g., Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 276, \u00a72B\n(2019), or permit oral applications only for certain cases, see,e.g., Iowa Code \u00a7321J.10.3 (2019). All of these factors make\nit very possible that the officer willneverbe able to\nidentify the suspect if he cannot continue the pursuit. SeeHiibelv.Sixth Judicial Dist. Court of Nev., Humboldt\nCty.,542 U.S.\n177, 186 (2004) (recognizing identification as an \u201cimportant\ngovernment interest[\u00a0]\u201d). The Court today creates \u201cperverse\nincentives\u201d by imposing an \u201cinvitation to\nimpunity-earned-by-recklessness.\u201dScott, 555 U.\u00a0S., at\n385\u2013386.Against these government interests we balance\nthe suspect\u2019s privacy interest in a home to which he has\nvoluntarily led a pursuing officer. If the residence is not his the\nsuspect has no privacy interest to protect.Rakasv.Illinois,439 U.S.\n128, 141 (1978); see alsoStatev.Walker,\n2006\u20131045, p. 7 (La. 4/11/07), 953 So. 2d 786, 790\u2013791 (suspect\nfled into third person\u2019s residence where he was unwelcome);Ulyssev.State, 899 So. 2d 1233, 1234 (Fla. App.\n2005) (suspect ran inside the home of \u201ca complete stranger\u201d). The\npolice may well have no reason to know whether the suspect entered\nhis own or someone else\u2019s home or yard. If the suspect does escape\ninto his own home, his privacy interest is diminished because he\nwas the one who chose to move his encounter with the police there.\nSeeStatev.Legg, 633 N.W.2d 763, 773 (Iowa 2001)\n(nature of intrusion is \u201cslight\u201d in hot pursuit because the\nofficer\u2019s entry \u201cwas no surprise to [the suspect]; he was following\nclosely on her heels\u201d); 4 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure \u00a79.2(d), p.\n419 (6th ed. 2020) (\u201cthe suspect has only himself to blame for the\nfact that the encounter has been moved from a public to a private\narea\u201d). In cases of hot pursuit, \u201c[t]he offender is then not being\nbothered by the police unexpectedly while in domestic tranquility.\nHe has gone to his home while fleeing solely to escape arrest.\u201dR.v.Macooh, [1993] 2 S.\u00a0C.\u00a0R. 802, 815.\nPut differently, just as arrestees have \u201creduced privacy\ninterests,\u201dRiley, 573 U.\u00a0S., at 391, so too do those\nwho evade arrest by leading the police on car chases into their\ngarages.C\u201cIn determining what is reasonable under the\nFourth Amendment, we have given great weight to the essential\ninterest in readily administrable rules.\u201dVirginiav.Moore,553 U.S.\n164, 175 (2008) (internal quotation marks omitted). This is\nparticularly true with respect to the rules governing exceptions to\nthe warrant requirement because of exigent circumstances. SeeMitchell, 588 U.\u00a0S., at ___, n. 3 (slip op., at 9,\nn.\u00a03). And contrary to the Court\u2019s suggestion, the home is not\nimmune from the application of such rules consistent with the\nFourth Amendment. See,e.g.,Summers, 452 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 705;Chimelv.California,395\nU.S. 752, 763 (1969).Like most rules, this one is not without\nexceptions or qualifications. The police cannot manufacture an\nunnecessary pursuit to enable a search of a home rather than to\nexecute an arrest. Cf.Fernandezv.California,571 U.S.\n292, 302 (2014) (\u201cevidence that the police have removed the\npotentially objecting tenant from the entrance for the sake of\navoiding possible objection\u201d would be probative of the objective\nunreasonableness of a warrantless entry based on the consent of\nanother occupant). Additionally, if a reasonable officer would not\nbelieve that the suspect fled into the home to \u201cthwart an otherwise\nproper arrest,\u201dSantana, 427 U.\u00a0S., at 42, warrantless\nentry would not be reasonable.Additional safeguards limit the potential for\nabuse. The officer must in all events effect a reasonable entry.United Statesv.Ramirez,523 U.S.\n65, 71 (1998). As the lower courts have recognized, hot pursuit\ngives the officer authority to enter a home, but \u201cit does not have\nany bearing on the constitutionality of the manner in which he\nenters the home.\u201dTrentv.Wade, 776 F.3d 368, 382\n(CA5 2015). And his authority to search is circumscribed, limited\nto \u201cthose spaces where a person may be found\u201d for \u201cno longer than\nit takes to complete the arrest and depart the premises.\u201dMarylandv.Buie,494 U.S.\n325, 335\u2013336 (1990). Finally, arrests conducted \u201cin an\nextraordinary manner, unusually harmful to an individual\u2019s privacy\nor even physical interests\u201d are subject to even more stringent\nreview.Whrenv.United States,517 U.S.\n806, 818 (1996).Courts must also ascertain whether a given set\nof circumstances actually qualifies as hot pursuit. While the\nflight need not be reminiscent of the opening scene of a James Bond\nfilm, there must be \u201csome sort of a chase.\u201dSantana, 427\nU.\u00a0S., at 43.The pursuit must be \u201cimmediate or\ncontinuous.\u201dWelshv.Wisconsin,466 U.S.\n740, 753 (1984). And the suspect should have known the officer\nintended for him to stop. Cf.Michiganv.Chesternut,486 U.S.\n567, 573\u2013574 (1988). Where a suspect, for example, chooses to\nend a voluntary conversation with law enforcement and go inside her\nhome, that does not constitute flight.Floridav.Royer,460 U.S.\n491, 497\u2013498 (1983) (plurality opinion).Because the California Court of Appeals assumed\nthat hot pursuit categorically permits warrantless entry, I would\nvacate the decision below to allow consideration of whether the\ncircumstances at issue in this case fall within an exception to the\ngeneral rule of the sort outlined above. Lange would be free to\nargue that his is the \u201cunusual case,\u201dMitchell, 588\nU.\u00a0S., at ____ (plurality opinion) (slip op., at 16), in which\nthe general rule that hot pursuit justifies warrantless entry does\nnot apply.IINow consider the regime the Court imposes. In\nrejecting theamicus\u2019 proposed categorical rule favoring\nwarrantless home entry, the Court creates a categorical rule of its\nown: Flight alone can never justify warrantless entry into a home\nor its curtilage. Instead, flight is but one factor of unclear\nweight to \u201cconsider,\u201dante,at 16, and it must be\nsupplemented with at least one additional exigency. This is\nnecessary, the Court explains, because people \u201cflee for innocuous\nreasons,\u201dante, at 10, although the Court offers just two\nactual examples of \u201cinnocuous\u201d flight, the harmlessness of which\nwould not have been apparent to the police, seeibid.\n(citingCarrollv.Ellington, 800 F.3d 154, 162 (CA5\n2015;Mascorrov.Billings, 656 F.3d 1198, 1202 (CA10\n2011)).In order to create a hot pursuit rule ostensibly\nspecific to misdemeanors, the Court must turn to a case concerning\nneither misdemeanors nor hot pursuit. InWelshv.Wisconsin, we held that the warrantless entry of a drunk\ndriver\u2019s home to arrest him for a nonjailable offense violated the\nFourth Amendment. 466 U.\u00a0S., at 754. The Court relies onWelshfor the proposition that \u201cwhen a minor offense alone\nis involved .\u00a0.\u00a0. officers can probably take the time to\nget a warrant\u201d to execute an arrest.Ante, at 9\u201310. The\nCourt\u2019s determination thatWelshapplies to all cases\ninvolving \u201cminor\u201d offenses\u2014although we never learn what qualifies\nas a minor offense\u2014ignores that we have already declined to applyWelshto cases involving misdemeanors because of the\n\u201csignificant\u201d distinction between nonjailable offenses and\nmisdemeanors.McArthur, 531 U.\u00a0S., at 336. And in any\nevent, we explicitly differentiated the circumstances at issue inWelshfrom \u201cimmediate or continuous pursuit of [a person]\nfrom the scene of a crime.\u201d 466 U.\u00a0S., at 753; seeBrigham\nCity, 547 U.\u00a0S., at 405 (rejectingWelsh\u2019s\napplication to a situation involving exigent circumstance of\nemergency aid). Accordingly, as we have already held, \u201cnothing in\n[Welsh] establishes that the seriousness of the crime is\nequally importantin cases of hot pursuit.\u201dStanton,\n571 U.\u00a0S., at 9 (emphasis in original). The Court\u2019s citation\nto Justice Jackson\u2019s concurrence inMcDonaldv.United\nStates,335 U.S.\n451(1948),ante,at 11, n.\u00a03, is similarly inapt.\nThat case involved entry for mere \u201cfollow[\u00a0] up,\u201d not anything\nresembling hot pursuit.McDonald, 335 U. S., at 459.The Court next limits its consideration of the\ninterests at stake to a balancing of what it perceives to be the\ngovernment\u2019s interest in capturing innocuous misdemeanants against\na person\u2019s privacy interest in his home. The question, however, is\nnot whether \u201clitter[ing]\u201d presents risks to public safety or the\npotential for escape,ante, at 8, but whetherflightdoes so. And flight from the police is never innocuous.The Court ultimately decides that, when it comes\nto misdemeanors, States do not have as much of an interest in\nseeing such laws enforced. But, as the Court concedes, we have\nalready rejected as \u201cuntenable\u201d the \u201cassumption that a \u2018felon\u2019 is\nmore dangerous than a misdemeanant.\u201dTennesseev.Garner,471 U.S.\n1, 14 (1985). This is so because \u201cnumerous misdemeanors involve\nconduct more dangerous than many felonies.\u201dIbid.At any\nrate, the fact that a suspect flees when suspected of a minor\noffense could well be indicative of a larger danger, given that he\nhas voluntarily exposed himself to much higher criminal penalties\nin exchange for the prospect of escaping or delaying arrest. Cf.Illinoisv.Wardlow,528 U.S.\n119, 124 (2000).The Court\u2019s rule is also famously difficult to\napply. The difference between the two categories of offenses is\nesoteric, to say the least. SeeAtwater, 532 U.\u00a0S., at\n350;Berkemerv.McCarty,468\nU.S. 420, 431, n.\u00a013 (1984) (\u201c[O]fficers in the field\nfrequently have neither the time nor the competence to determine\nthe severity of the offense for which they are considering\narresting a person.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). For\nexample, driving while under the influence is a misdemeanor in many\nStates, but becomes a felony if the suspect is a serial drunk\ndriver. See,e.g., Alaska Stat. \u00a728.35.030(n) (2020). Drug\npossession may be a misdemeanor or a felony depending on the weight\nof the drugs. See,e.g., Ohio Rev. Code Ann. \u00a72925.11(C)\n(Lexis 2019) (outlining 50 potential iterations of unlawful drug\npossession, some misdemeanors others felonies). Layer on top of\nthis that for certain offenses the exact same conduct may be\ncharged as a misdemeanor or felony depending on the discretionary\ndecisions of the prosecutor and the judge (what California refers\nto as a \u201cwobbler\u201d), and we have a recipe for paralysis in the face\nof flight. See Cal. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7486\u2013490.1 (West Cum. Supp.\n2021) (classifying theft as an infraction, misdemeanor, wobbler, or\nfelony depending on the value of the stolen item).The Court permits constitutional protections to\nvary based on how each State has chosen to classify a given\noffense. For example, \u201chuman trafficking\u201d can be a misdemeanor in\nMaryland, Md. Crim. Law Code Ann. \u00a73\u20131102(c)(1) (2019), contra,\nTex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a720 A. 02 (West 2021), and in Pennsylvania so\ncan involuntary manslaughter, 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. \u00a72504(b) (2015);\ncontra, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. \u00a72903.04(C). The vehicular flight at\nissue in this very case is classified as a felony in several\nStates. See,e.g.,Fla. Stat. \u00a7316.1935 (2014); Del. Code\nAnn., Tit. 21, \u00a74103 (2013). Law enforcement entities and state\ngovernments across the Nation tell us that they have accord- ingly\ndeveloped standards for warrantless entry in hot pursuit tailored\nto their respective legal regimes. See Brief for Los Angeles County\nPolice Chiefs\u2019 Association asAmicus Curiae14\u201320; Brief for\nState of Ohio et\u00a0al. asAmici Curiae25. Given the\ndistinct nature of each State\u2019s legal code, such an approach is\nmore appropriate than the Court\u2019s blunt constitutional reform.For all these reasons, we have not crafted\nconstitutional rules based on the distinction between modern day\nmisdemeanors and felonies. InTennesseev.Garner,\nfor example, we held that deadly force could not categorically be\nused to seize a fleeing felon, even though the common law supplied\nsuch a rule, because at common law the \u201cgulf between the felonies\nand the minor offences was broad and deep,\u201d but today it is \u201cminor\nand often arbitrary.\u201d 471 U.\u00a0S., at 14 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).Similarly, inAtwater, we held that the\ngeneral probable- cause rule for warrantless arrests applied to\n\u201ceven a very minor criminal offense,\u201d \u201cwithout the need to balance\nthe interests and circumstances involved in particular situations.\u201d\n532 U.\u00a0S., at 354 (internal quotation marks omitted). We\nexplained that we could not expect every police officer to\nautomatically recall \u201cthe details of frequently complex penalty\nschemes,\u201d and concluded that distinguishing between \u201cpermissible\nand impermissible arrests for minor crimes\u201d was a \u201cvery\nunsatisfactory line to require police officers to draw on a\nmoment\u2019s notice.\u201dId., at 348, 350 (internal quotation marks\nand alteration omitted).The Court\u2019s approach is hopelessly indeterminate\nin other respects as well. The Court admonishes law enforcement to\ndistinguish between \u201cdangerous offender[s]\u201d and \u201cscared\nteenager[s],\u201dante,at 11, as if an officer can easily tell\none from the other, and as if the two categories are mutually\nexclusive. See Dept. of Justice, Office of Juvenile Justice and\nDelinquency Prevention, Offending by Juveniles (Mar. 31, 2020)\n(about 16% of serious violent crimes in the United States from 2007\nto 2017 were committed by juveniles). And police are instructed to\nwait for a warrant if there is sufficient \u201ctime,\u201dante, at\n16, but they are not told time beforewhat, how many hours\nthe Court would have them wait, and what to do if other \u201cpressing\nneeds\u201d arise. SeeMitchell, 588 U.\u00a0S., at ___\n(plurality opinion) (slip op., at 9) (\u201c[A]n officer\u2019s duty to\nattend to more pressing needs may leave no time to seek a\nwarrant.\u201d).The Court tut-tuts that we are making far too\nmuch of all this, and that our \u201calarmism [is] misplaced.\u201dAnte, at 11, n. 3. In fact, the Court says, its \u201capproach\nwill in many, if not most, cases allow a warrantless home entry.\u201dAnte, at 11. In support of that assurance, the Court lists\nseveral \u201cexigencies above and beyond the flight itself\u00a0\u201d that\nwould permit home entry, notably when \u201cthe fleeing misdemeanant\u201d\nwill \u201cescape from the home.\u201dAnte,at 11, n.\u00a03. If an\nofficer \u201creasonably believes\u201d such an exigency exists,\u201d the Court\nsays, \u201che does not need a categorical misdemeanor-pursuit rule to\njustify a warrantless home entry.\u201dIbid.When a suspect flees into a dwelling there\ntypically will be another way out, such as a back door or fire\nescape. See Cal. Code Regs., tit. 24, \u00a7\u00a71113.2, 1114.8 (2019)\n(apartments, floors of high-rise buildings, and many other homes\nmust have access to at least two means of egress). If the officer\nreasonably believes there are multiple exits, then surely the\nofficer can conclude that the suspect might well \u201cescape from the\nhome,\u201dante, at 11, n. 3, by running out the back, rather\nthan \u201cslowing down and wiping his brow\u201d while the officer attempts\nto get a warrant.Scott, 550 U.\u00a0S., at 385. Under the\nCourt\u2019s rule warrantless entry into a home in hot pursuit of a\nfleeing misdemeanant would presumably be permissible, as long as\nthe officer reasonably believed the home had another exit.\nQuestion: Is that correct? Police in the field deserve to know.But the Court will not answer the question,\nleaving it to the officer to figure out in the midst of hot\npursuit. The answer apparently depends on whether the police\n\u201cbelieve anything harmful will happen in the time it takes to get a\nwarrant,\u201dante, at 11, n. 3, but again, what the police\nreasonably believe will happen is of course that the suspect will\ncontinue his flight and escape out the back. If that reasonable\nbelief is an exigency, then it is present in almost every case of\nhot pursuit into the home. Perhaps that is why Lange\u2019s counsel\nadmitted that \u201cnine times out of ten or more\u201d warrantless entry in\nhot pursuit of misdemeanants would be reasonable. Tr. of Oral Arg.\n34.IIIAlthough the Fourth Amendment is not \u201cfrozen\u201d\nin time, we have used the common law as a reference point for\nassessing the reasonableness of police activity.Garner, 471\nU.\u00a0S., at 13. The Court errs, however, in concluding with the\nsuggestion that history supports its novel incentive to flee.The history is not nearly as clear as the Court\nsuggests. The Court is forced to rely on an argument by negative\nimplication: if common law authorities supported a categorical rule\nfavoring warrantless entry in pursuit of felons, warrantless entry\nin pursuit of misdemeanants must have been prohibited. That is\nwrong. Countless sources support the proposition that officers\ncould and did pursue into homes those who had committed all sorts\nof offenses that the Court seems to deem \u201cminor.\u201dAnte, at\n8.For example, common law authorities describe\nwith approval warrantless home entry in pursuit of those who had\ncommitted an affray (public fighting), 1 W. Hawkins, Pleas of the\nCrown 137 (1716), and \u201cdisorderly drinking,\u201d W. Simpson, The\nPractical Justice of the Peace and the Parish Officer 26 (1761).\nAnd the doctrine of \u201chue and cry\u201d permitted townspeople to pursue\nthose suspected of \u201cmisdemeanor[s]\u201d if the perpetrator \u201cescape[d]\ninto [his] house.\u201d R. Bevill, Law of Homicide 162\u2013163 (1799). In\ncolonial America, the hue and cry extended to a \u201cgreat diversity of\ncrimes,\u201d including stealing livestock and revealing oneself to be a\nQuaker. W. Cuddihy, The Fourth Amendment: Origins and Original\nMeaning 244\u2013246 (2009).Finally, at common law an officer could \u201cbreak\nopen Doors, in order to apprehend Offenders\u201d whenever a person was\narrested for \u201cany Cause,\u201d and thereafter escaped. 2 Hawkins,\nPleas of the Crown, at 86\u201387 (1787) (emphasis added). The Court\u2019s\nattempt to dispose of this awkward reality in a footnote,ante,at 14, n.\u00a05, is unconvincing. Flight and escape\nboth present attempts to \u201cthwart an otherwise proper arrest,\u201dSantana, 427 U.\u00a0S., at 42, and as noted, the common law\ndid not differentiate among escapees based on the perceived\nmagnitude of their underlying offense, R. Burn, The Justice of the\nPeace 101\u2013103 (14th ed. 1780).Clearly the list of offenses that historically\njustified warrantless home entry in hot pursuit of a fleeing\nsuspect were as broad and varied as those found in a contemporary\ncompilation of misdemeanors. See alsoMacooh, [1993] 2\nS.\u00a0C.\u00a0R., at 817 (concluding after review that at common\nlaw \u201cthe right to enter in hot pursuit\u201d was not \u201climited to arrest\nfor felonies\u201d);Lyonsv.R., [1984] 2\nS.\u00a0C.\u00a0R. 633, 657 (recognizing \u201cright of pursuit\u201d as a\nlongstanding exception to common law protection of the sanctity of\nthe home).In the face of this evidence, the Court fails to\ncite a single circumstance in which warrantless entry in hot\npursuit was found to be unlawful at common law. It then\nacknowledges that \u201csome of the specifics are uncertain, and\ncommentators did not always agree with each other.\u201dAnte,at\n14. InAtwater,we declined to forbid warrantless arrests\nfor minor offenses when we found \u201cdisagreement, not unanimity,\namong both the common-law jurists and the text writers who sought\nto pull the cases together.\u201d 532 U.\u00a0S., at 332. The historical\nambiguity is at least as pervasive here.Even if the common law practice surrounding hot\npursuit were unassailably clear, its treatment of the topic before\nus would still be incomplete. That is because the common law did\nnot recognize the remedy Lange seeks: exclusion of evidence in a\ncriminal case.Collins, 584 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at\n2) (Thomas, J., concurring). It is often difficult to conceive of\nhow common law rights were influenced by the absence of modern\nremedies. And in this case we have no guidance from history as to\nhow our doctrines surrounding the exclusionary rule, such as\ninevitable discovery, would map onto situations in which a person\nattempts to thwart a public arrest by retreating to a private\nplace. SeeNixv.Williams,467\nU.S. 431, 443\u2013444 (1984).*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*Recall the assault we started with. The\nofficer was closing in on the suspect when he hopped the fence and\nstopped in a yard. The officer starts to climb over the fence to\narrest him, but wait\u2014was the assault a misdemeanor or a felony? In\nLange\u2019s State of California, it could have been either depending on\nthe identity of the victim, the amount of force used, and whether\nthere was a weapon involved. See Cal. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7245 (West\n2014). How much force was the man using against the teenager? Is\nthis really the assailant\u2019s home in the first place? Pretty\nsuspicious that he jumped the fence just as the officer was about\nto grab him. If it is his home, are there people inside and, if so,\nhow many? And why would the man run from a mere fight\u2014does he have\nsomething more serious to hide?By this time, of course, the assailant has\nprobably gone out the back door or down the fire escape and is\nblocks away, with the officer unable to give a useful\ndescription\u2014except for how he looks from behind.",
