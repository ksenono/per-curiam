The statute specifies that \u201c[a]ll the\nexpenses of the proceedings shall be paid by the applicant.\u201dIbid.The question presented in this case is whether such\n\u201cexpenses\u201d include the salaries of attorney and paralegal employees\nof the United States Patent and Trademark Office (PTO). We hold\nthat they do not.IAThe Patent Act creates two mutually exclusive\npathways to challenge an adverse decision by the PTO. The first\npermits judicial review by direct appeal to the United States Court\nof Appeals for the Federal Circuit. \u00a7141. There is \u201cno opportunity\nfor the applicant to offer new evidence\u201d in a \u00a7141 proceeding, and\nthe Federal Circuit \u201cmust review the PTO\u2019s decision on the same\nadministrative record that was before the [agency].\u201dKapposv.Hyatt,566 U.S.\n431, 434 (2012); 35 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7144.The second pathway allows applicants to file a\nnew civil action against the Director of the PTO in federal\ndistrict court. \u00a7145. Unlike \u00a7141, \u00a7145 \u201cpermits the applicant to\npresent new evidence .\u00a0.\u00a0. not presented to the PTO.\u201dKappos, 566 U.\u00a0S., at 435. The district court\n\u201cacts as a factfinder when new evidence is introduced in a \u00a7145\nproceeding\u201d and must makede\u00a0novodeterminations that\ntake into account \u201cboth the new evidence and the administrative\nrecord before the PTO.\u201dId., at 444, 446. The parties may\nappeal the district court\u2019s final decision to the Federal Circuit.\n28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71295(a)(4)(C).Because \u00a7145 does not limit an applicant\u2019s\nability to introduce new evidence to challenge the denial of a\npatent,Kappos, 566 U.\u00a0S., at 439, it can result in\nprotracted litigation. As a condition for permitting such extensive\nreview, the Patent Act requires applicants who avail themselves of\n\u00a7145 to pay \u201c[a]ll the expenses of the proceedings.\u201d 35\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7145.BAfter the PTO denied respondent NantKwest,\nInc.\u2019s patent application directed to a method for treating cancer,\nNantKwest filed a complaint against the PTO Director in the Eastern\nDistrict of Virginia under \u00a7145. The District Court granted summary\njudgment to the PTO, and the Federal Circuit affirmed.NantKwest, Inc.v.Lee, 686 Fed. Appx. 864 (2017).\nThe PTO moved for reimbursement of expenses that included\u2014for the\nfirst time in the 170-year history of \u00a7145\u2014the pro\u00a0rata\nsalaries of PTO attorneys and a paralegal who worked on the\ncase.The District Court denied the PTO\u2019s motion to\nrecover its pro\u00a0rata legal fees as \u201cexpenses\u201d of the \u00a7145\nproceeding. The court concluded that the statutory language\nreferencing expenses was not clear enough to rebut the \u201cAmerican\nRule\u201d\u2014the background principle that parties are responsible for\ntheir own attorney\u2019s fees.NantKwest, Inc.v.Lee,\n162 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d 540, 542 (ED Va. 2016). A divided Federal\nCircuit panel reversed, with Judge Stoll dissenting.NantKwest,\nInc.v.Matal, 860 F.3d 1352 (2017). The majority\nexpressed \u201csubstantial doub[t\u00a0]\u201d that \u00a7145 even implicated the\nAmerican Rule\u2019s presumption against fee shifting in a case in which\nthe payment was not made to a prevailing party.Id.,at\n1355. The majority concluded that, even assuming the American Rule\npresumption applied, the term \u201cexpenses\u201d in \u00a7145 \u201cspecific[ally]\u201d\nand \u201cexplicit[ly]\u201d authorized an award of fees.Id., at\n1356.The en banc Federal Circuit votedsua\u00a0sponteto rehear the case and reversed the panel\nover a dissent.NantKwest, Inc.v.Iancu, 898 F.3d\n1177, 1184 (2018). The majority opinion\u2014now authored by Judge\nStoll\u2014held that the American Rule presumption applied to \u00a7145\nbecause it is \u201cthe starting point whenever a party seeks to shift\nfees from one side to the other in adversarial litigation.\u201dId., at 1184 (citingBaker Botts L. L. P.v.ASARCO LLC, 576 U.S. 121, ___ (2015)). After examining the\nplain text and statutory history of \u00a7145, the judicial and\ncongressional understanding of similar language, and overarching\npolicy considerations, the majority concluded that \u201c[a]warding\n\u2018[a]ll the expenses\u2019 simply cannot supply the \u2018specific and\nexplicit\u2019 directive from Congress to shift attorneys\u2019 fees, and\nnothing else in the statute evinces congressional intent to make\nthem available.\u201d 898 F.\u00a03d, at 1196 (quotingAlyeska\nPipeline Service Co.v.Wilderness Society,421 U.S.\n240, 260 (1975)). We granted certiorari, 586 U.\u00a0S. ___\n(2019), and now affirm.IIThis Court\u2019s \u201c\u00a0\u2018basic point of reference\u2019\nwhen considering the award of attorney\u2019s fees is the bedrock\nprinciple known as the \u2018\u00a0\u201cAmerican Rule\u201d\u00a0\u2019: Each litigant\npays his own attorney\u2019s fees, win or lose, unless a statute or\ncontract provides otherwise.\u201dHardtv.Reliance Standard\nLife Ins. Co.,560 U.S.\n242, 252\u2013253 (2010) (quotingRuckelshausv.Sierra\nClub,463 U.S.\n680, 683 (1983)). The American Rule has \u201croots in our common\nlaw reaching back to at least the 18th century.\u201dBaker\nBotts, 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 3) (citingArcambelv.Wiseman, 3 Dall. 306 (1796)); see alsoSummit Valley Industries, Inc.v.Carpenters,456 U.S.\n717, 721 (1982) (observing that the American Rule \u201chas been\nconsistently followed for almost 200 years\u201d);Alyeska\nPipeline, 421 U.\u00a0S., at 257 (referring to the presumption\nagainst shifting attorney\u2019s fees as a \u201cgeneral\u201d rule).The Government does not dispute this principle\nor its pedigree, but argues instead that it does not apply at all.\nBecause the American Rule presumption is most often overcome when a\nstatute awards fees to a \u201cprevailing party,\u201d the Government\nmaintains, the presumption applies only to prevailing-party\nstatutes. And because \u00a7145 requires one party to pay all expenses\nregardless of outcome, the argument goes, it is not a statute\nsubject to the presumption.That view is incorrect. This Court has never\nsuggested that any statute is exempt from the presumption against\nfee shifting. Nor has it limited its American Rule inquiries to\nprevailing-party statutes. Indeed, the Court has developed a \u201cline\nof precedents\u201d \u201caddressing statutory deviations from the American\nRule that do not limit attorney\u2019s fees awards to the \u2018prevailing\nparty.\u2019\u00a0\u201dHardt, 560 U.\u00a0S., at 254; see alsoBaker Botts, 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 5\u20137)\n(analyzing a bankruptcy provision that did not mention prevailing\nparties under the American Rule\u2019s presumption against fee\nshifting).Sebeliusv.Cloer,569 U.S.\n369(2013), confirms that the presumption against fee shifting\napplies to all statutes\u2014even those like \u00a7145 that do not explicitly\naward attorney\u2019s fees to \u201cprevailing parties.\u201d InCloer, the\nCourt interpreted a provision of the National Childhood Vaccine\nInjury Act that permitted courts to \u201caward attorney\u2019s fees\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. \u2018incur- red [by a claimant] in any proceeding on\u2019\nan unsuccessful vaccine-injury \u2018petition .\u00a0.\u00a0. brought in\ngood faith [with] a reasonable basis for the claim.\u2019\u00a0\u201d 569\nU.\u00a0S.,at 371 (quoting 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7300aa\u201315(e)(1)). The Court held that the provision\u2019s clear\nlanguage authorized attorney\u2019s fees, even though the statute\nexclusively applied to unsuccessful litigants. 569 U.\u00a0S., at\n372.Cloerestablishes two points: First,\ncontrary to the Government\u2019s suggestion, Congress has indeed\nenacted fee-shifting statutes that apply to nonprevailing parties.\nSecond, and again contrary to the Government\u2019s view, the American\nRule applies to such statutes. The Government itself argued inCloerthat the presumption against fee shifting applied by\ndefault, but maintained that the statute \u201cdepart[ed] so far from\nbackground principles about who pays a litigant\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees\nthat it [could not] be justified without a clearer statement than\nthe Act can supply.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Brief for Petitioner inSebeliusv.Cloer, O. T. 2012, No. 12\u2013236, p. 32. The Court\nacknowledged the Government\u2019s position but concluded that the\n\u201crul[e\u00a0] of thumb\u201d against fee shifting gave way because the\n\u201cwords of [the] statute [were] unambiguous.\u201dCloer, 569\nU.\u00a0S., at 380\u2013381 (citing the Government\u2019s brief\u00a0).The dissenting en banc Federal Circuit Judges\nalso doubted that the American Rule could apply to a \u00a7145 action.\nThey characterized the proceeding as an intermediate step in\nobtaining a patent and the payment of legal fees as a portion of\nthe application costs. 898 F.\u00a03d, at 1200 (opinion of Prost,\nJ.). Yet \u00a7145 has all the marks of the kind of adversarial\nlitigation in which fee shifting, and the presumption against it,\nis common; the statute authorizes filing a separate civil action\nwhere new evidence can be introduced forde\u00a0novoreview\nby a district judge. Thus, the presumption against fee shifting not\nonly applies, but is particularly important because \u00a7145 permits an\nunsuccessful government agency to recover its expenses from a\nprevailing party. Reading \u00a7145 to award attorney\u2019s fees in that\ncircumstance \u201cwould be a radical departure from longstanding\nfee-shifting principles adhered to in a wide range of contexts.\u201dRuckelshaus, 463 U.\u00a0S., at 683.The American Rule thus provides the starting\npoint for assessing whether \u00a7145 authorizes payment of the PTO\u2019s\nlegal fees.IIITo determine whether Congress intended to\ndepart from the American Rule presumption, the Court first \u201clook[s]\nto the language of the section\u201d at issue.Hardt, 560\nU.\u00a0S., at 254 (internal quotation marks omitted). While \u201c[t]he\nabsence of [a] specific reference to attorney\u2019s fees is not\ndispositive,\u201dKey Tronic Corp.v.United States,511 U.S.\n809, 815 (1994), Congress must provide a sufficiently \u201cspecific\nand explicit\u201d indication of its intent to overcome the American\nRule\u2019s presumption against fee shifting.Alyeska Pipeline,\n421 U.\u00a0S., at 260.AThe reference to \u201cexpenses\u201d in \u00a7145 does not\ninvoke attorney\u2019s fees with the kind of \u201cclarity we have required\nto deviate from the American Rule.\u201dBaker Botts, 576\nU.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 4).Definitions of \u201cexpenses\u201d provide scant\nguidance. The term, standing alone, encompasses wide-ranging\n\u201cexpenditure[s] of money, time, labor, or resources to accomplish a\nresult,\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 698 (10th ed. 2014), \u201ccharges or\ncosts met with in .\u00a0.\u00a0. doing one\u2019s work,\u201d Webster\u2019s New\nWorld College Dictionary 511 (5th ed. 2014), and \u201coutlay[s]\u201d for\nlabor, Merriam-Webster\u2019s Dictionary of Law 180 (1996); see also N.\nWebster, An American Dictionary of the English Language 319 (3d ed.\n1830) (defining the term broadly to include \u201cthe employment and\nconsumption, as of time or labor,\u201d or the \u201cdisbursing of money\u201d).\nThough these definitions are capacious enough to include attorney\u2019s\nfees, the mere failure to foreclose a fee award \u201cneither\nspecifically nor explicitly authorizes courts to shift [fees].\u201dBaker Botts, 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 6).Reading the term \u201cexpenses\u201d alongside\nneighboring words in the statute, however, supports a conclusion\nexcluding legal fees from the scope of \u00a7145. The complete phrase\n\u201cexpenses of the proceeding\u201d is similar to the Latinexpens\u00e6\nlitis, or \u201cexpenses of the litigation.\u201d This term has long\nreferred to a class of expenses commonly recovered in litigation to\nwhich attorney\u2019s fees did not traditionally belong. See Black\u2019s Law\nDictionary 461 (1891) (defining \u201cexpens\u00e6 litis\u201d to mean\n\u201cgenerally allowed\u201d costs); 1 J. Bouvier, Law Dictionary 392 (1839)\n(defining the term to mean the \u201ccosts which are generally allowed\nto the successful party\u201d);id., at 244 (excluding from the\ndefinition of \u201ccosts\u201d the \u201cextraordinary fees [a party] may have\npaid counsel\u201d). These definitions suggest that the use of\n\u201cexpenses\u201d in \u00a7145 would not have been commonly understood to\ninclude attorney\u2019s fees at its enactment.Finally, the modifier \u201call\u201d does not expand\n\u00a7145\u2019s reach to include attorney\u2019s fees. Although the word conveys\nbreadth, it cannot transform \u201cexpenses\u201d to reach an outlay it would\nnot otherwise include. Cf.Rimini Street, Inc.v.Oracle\nUSA, Inc., 586 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___\u2013___ (2019) (slip op., at\n6\u20137) (\u201cThe adjective \u2018full\u2019 in \u00a7505 therefore does not alter the\nmeaning of the word \u2018costs.\u2019 Rather, \u2018full costs\u2019 are all the\n\u2018costs\u2019 otherwise available under law\u201d).Section 145\u2019s plain text thus does not overcome\nthe American Rule\u2019s presumption against fee shifting to permit the\nPTO to recoup its legal personnel salaries as \u201cexpenses of the\nproceedings.\u201dB\u201cThe record of statutory usage\u201d also\nillustrates how the term \u201cexpenses\u201d alone does not authorize\nrecovery of attorney\u2019s fees. SeeWest Virginia Univ. Hospitals,\nInc.v.Casey,499 U.S.\n83, 88 (1991) (looking to statutory usage to determine whether\nattorney\u2019s fees and expert fees were distinct expenses in the\nfee-shifting context).That \u201cexpenses\u201d and \u201cattorney\u2019s fees\u201d appear in\ntandem across various statutes shifting litigation costs indicates\nthat Congress understands the two terms to be distinct and not\ninclusive of each other. See,e.g.,898 F.\u00a03d, at 1188\n(quoting 11 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7363(n) (allowing trustee to recover\n\u201cany costs, attorneys\u2019 fees, or expenses incurred\u201d); 12\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71786(p) (permitting courts to \u201callow to any\nsuch party such reasonable expenses and attorneys\u2019 fees as it deems\njust and proper\u201d); 25 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71401(a) (allowing\ndistribution of funds after payment of \u201cattorney fees and\nlitigation expenses\u201d); 26 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a76673(a)(2)(A)\n(authorizing recovery of \u201ccosts, expenses, and attorneys\u2019 fees\u201d\nagainst an attorney who \u201cunreasonably and vexatiously\u201d multiplies\nproceedings); 31 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73730(d)(1) (permitting\nrecovery of \u201creasonable expenses .\u00a0.\u00a0. plus reasonable\nattorneys\u2019 fees and costs\u201d); 38 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a74323(h)(2)\n(allowing courts to award \u201creasonable attorney fees, expert witness\nfees, and other litigation expenses\u201d) (all internal quotation marks\nomitted)).While some other statutes refer to attorney\u2019s\nfees as a subset of expenses, they show only that \u201cexpenses\u201d can\ninclude attorney\u2019s fees when so defined. See,e.g.,28 U. S.\nC. \u00a7361 (authorizing \u201creasonable expenses, including attorneys\u2019\nfees\u201d); \u00a71447(c) (\u201cAn order remanding the case may require payment\nof just costs and any actual expenses, including attorney fees,\nincurred as a result of the removal\u201d); 29 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a71370(e)(1) (\u201c[T]he court in its discretion may award all or a\nportion of the costs and expenses incurred in connection with such\naction including reasonable attorney\u2019s fees\u201d); 42\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7247d\u20136d(e)(9) (allowing a party to recover\n\u201creasonable expenses incurred .\u00a0.\u00a0. , including a\nreasonable attorney\u2019s fee\u201d).The Government cites several decisions to argue\nhow, on occasion, this Court has used the term \u201cexpenses\u201d to mean\n\u201cattorney\u2019s fees.\u201d None of the cases furthers its position. See,e.g.,Rimini Street, 586 U.\u00a0S., at ___, ___\n(slip op., at 4, 11) (reasoning that the term \u201ccosts\u201d in the\ngeneral federal costs statutes does not include attorney\u2019s fees);Taniguchiv.Kan Pacific Saipan, Ltd.,566 U.S.\n560, 573 (2012) (mentioning that a party may bear \u201cexpenses\u201d\nrelated to attorneys, without specifying whether these \u201cexpenses\u201d\ninclude attorney\u2019s fees);Arlington Central School Dist. Bd. of\nEd.v.Murphy,548 U.S.\n291, 297\u2013303 (2006) (distinguishing \u201cattorney\u2019s fees\u201d from\n\u201ccosts\u201d and \u201ccosts\u201d from \u201cexpenses,\u201d without indicating whether\n\u201cexpenses\u201d encompasses attorney\u2019s fees);Casey, 499\nU.\u00a0S., at 99 (suggesting that an explicit reference to \u201cexpert\nwitness fees\u201d or \u201clitigation expenses\u201d could shift expert fees in\naddition to attorney\u2019s fees\u2014not that the term \u201clitigation expenses\u201d\nalone could shift attorney\u2019s fees).Simply put, in common statutory usage, the term\n\u201cexpenses\u201d alone has never been considered to authorize an award of\nattorney\u2019s fees with sufficient clarity to overcome the American\nRule presumption.CIn fact, the Patent Act\u2019s history reinforces\nthat Congress did not intend to shift fees in \u00a7145 actions.There is no evidence that the Patent Office, the\nPTO\u2019s predecessor, originally paid its personnel from sums\ncollected from adverse parties in litigation, or that the Office\ninitially even employed attorneys. See Act of July 4, 1836, \u00a79,\n5Stat. 121 (\u201c[T]he moneys received into the Treasury under this act\nshall constitute a fund for the payment of the salaries of the\nofficers and clerks herein provided for, and all other expenses of\nthe Patent Office, and to be called the patent fund\u201d). That\nsalaries of PTO employees might have qualified as an \u201cexpense\u201d of\nthe agency, however, does not mean that they are an \u201cexpense\u201d of a\n\u00a7145 proceeding. Neither has the PTO, until this litigation, sought\nits attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7145. That the agency has managed to pay\nits attorneys consistently suggests that financial necessity does\nnot require reading \u00a7145 to shift fees, either.In later years, when Congress intended to\nprovide for attorney\u2019s fees in the Patent Act, it stated so\nexplicitly. See,e.g., 35 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7285 (\u201cThe\ncourt in exceptional cases may award reasonable attorney fees to\nthe prevailing party\u201d); \u00a7271(e)(4) (\u201c[A] court may award attorney\nfees under section 285\u201d); \u00a7273(f\u00a0) (same); \u00a7296(b) (same);\n\u00a7297(b)(1) (\u201cAny customer .\u00a0.\u00a0. who is found by a court\nto have been injured by any material false or fraudulent statement\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. may recover .\u00a0.\u00a0. reasonable costs and\nattorneys\u2019 fees\u201d). Because Congress failed to make its intention\nsimilarly clear in \u00a7145, the Court will not read the statute to\n\u201ccontravene fundamental precepts of the common law.\u201dUnited\nStatesv.Rodgers,461 U.S.\n677, 716 (1983).The history of the Patent Act thus reaffirms the\nCourt\u2019s view that the statute does not specifically or explicitly\nauthorize the PTO to recoup its lawyers\u2019 or paralegals\u2019\npro\u00a0rata salaries in \u00a7145 civil actions.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that\nthe PTO cannot recover the pro rata salaries of its legal personnel\nunder \u00a7145 and therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of\nAppeals for the Federal Circuit.It is so ordered.",
