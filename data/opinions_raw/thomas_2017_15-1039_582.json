The\nBPCIA governs a type of drug called a biosimilar, which is a\nbiologic product that is highly similar to a biologic product that\nhas already been approved by the Food and Drug Administration\n(FDA). Under \u00a7262(l), an applicant that seeks FDA approval\nof a biosimilar must provide its application materials and\nmanufacturing information to the manufacturer of the corresponding\nbiologic within 20 days of the date the FDA notifies the applicant\nthat it has accepted the application for review. The applicant then\nmust give notice to the manufacturer at least 180 days before\nmarketing the biosimilar commercially.The first question presented by these cases is\nwhether the requirement that an applicant provide its application\nand manufacturing information to the manufacturer of the biologic\nis enforceable by injunction. We conclude that an injunction is not\navailable under federal law, but we remand for the court below to\ndecide whether an injunction is available under state law. The\nsecond question is whether the applicant must give notice to the\nmanufac-turer after, rather than before, obtaining a license from\nthe FDA for its biosimilar. We conclude that an applicant may\nprovide notice before obtaining a license.IThe complex statutory scheme at issue in these\ncases establishes processes both for obtaining FDA approval of\nbiosimilars and for resolving patent disputes between manufacturers\nof licensed biologics and manufacturers of biosimilars. Before\nturning to the questions presented, we first explain the statutory\nbackground.AA biologic is a type of drug derived from\nnatural, biological sources such as animals or microorganisms.\nBiologics thus differ from traditional drugs, which are typically\nsynthesized from chemicals.[1]\nA manufacturer of a biologic may market the drug only if the FDA\nhas licensed it pursuant to either of two review processes set\nforth in \u00a7262. The default pathway for approval, used for new\nbiologics, is set forth in \u00a7262(a). Under that subsection, the FDA\nmay license a new biologic if, among other things, the manufacturer\ndemonstrates that it is \u201csafe, pure, and potent.\u201d\n\u00a7262(a)(2)(C)(i)(I). In addition to this default route, the statute\nalso prescribes an alternative, abbreviated route for FDA approval\nof biosimilars, which is set forth in \u00a7262(k).To obtain approval through the BPCIA\u2019s\nabbreviated process, the manufacturer of a biosimilar (applicant)\ndoes not need to show that the product is \u201csafe, pure, and potent.\u201d\nInstead, the applicant may piggyback on the showing made by the\nmanufacturer (sponsor) of a previously licensed biologic (reference\nproduct). See \u00a7262(k)(2)(A)(iii). An applicant must show that its\nproduct is \u201chighly similar\u201d to the reference product and that there\nare no \u201cclinically meaningful differences\u201d between the two in terms\nof \u201csafety, purity, and potency.\u201d \u00a7\u00a7262(i)(2)(A), (B); see also\n\u00a7262(k)(2)(A)(i)(I).An applicant may not submit an\napplication until 4 years after the reference product is first\nlicensed, and the FDA may not license a biosimilar until 12 years\nafter the reference product is first licensed. \u00a7\u00a7262(k)(7)(A), (B).\nAs a result, the manufacturer of a new biologic enjoys a 12-year\nperiod when its biologic may be marketed without competition from\nbiosimilars.BA sponsor may hold multiple patents covering\nthe biologic, its therapeutic uses, and the processes used to\nmanufacture it. Those patents may constrain an applicant\u2019s ability\nto market its biosimilar even after the expiration of the 12-year\nexclusivity period contained in \u00a7262(k)(7)(A).The BPCIA facilitates litigation during the\nperiod preceding FDA approval so that the parties do not have to\nwait until commercial marketing to resolve their patent disputes.\nIt enables the parties to bring infringement actions at certain\npoints in the application process, even if the applicant has not\nyet committed an act that would traditionally constitute patent\ninfringement. See 35 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7271(a) (traditionally\ninfringing acts include making, using, offering to sell, or selling\nany patented invention within the United States without authority\nto do so). Specifically, it provides that the mere submission of a\nbiosimilar application constitutes an act of infringement.\n\u00a7\u00a7271(e)(2)(C)(i), (ii). We will refer to this kind of preapproval\ninfringement as \u201cartificial\u201d infringement. Section 271(e)(4)\nprovides remedies for artificial infringement, including injunctive\nrelief and damages.CThe BPCIA sets forth a carefully calibrated\nscheme for preparing to adjudicate, and then adjudicating, claims\nof infringement. See 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7262(l). When the\nFDA accepts an application for review, it notifies the applicant,\nwho within 20 days \u201cshall provide\u201d to the sponsor a copy of the\napplication and information about how the biosimilar is\nmanufactured. \u00a7262(l)(2)(A). The applicant also \u201cmay\nprovide\u201d the sponsor with any additional information that it\nrequests. \u00a7262(l)(2)(B). These disclosures enable the\nsponsor to evaluate the biosimilar for possible infringement of\npatents it holds on the reference product (i.e., the\ncorresponding biologic). \u00a7262(l)(1)(D). The information the\napplicant provides is subject to strict confidentiality rules,\nenforceable by injunction. See \u00a7262(l)(1)(H). The first\nquestion presented by these cases is whether \u00a7262(l)(2)(A)\u2019s\nrequirement\u2014that the applicant provide its application and\nmanufacturing information to the sponsor\u2014is itself enforceable by\ninjunction.After the applicant makes the requisite\ndisclosures, the parties exchange information to identify relevant\npatents and to flesh out the legal arguments that they might raise\nin future litigation. Within 60 days of receiving the application\nand manufacturing information, the sponsor \u201cshall provide\u201d to the\napplicant \u201ca list of patents\u201d for which it believes it could assert\nan infringement claim if a person without a license made, used,\noffered to sell, sold, or imported \u201cthe biological product that is\nthe subject of the [biosimilar] application.\u201d\n\u00a7262(l)(3)(A)(i). The sponsor must also identify any patents\non the list that it would be willing to license.\n\u00a7262(l)(3)(A)(ii).Next, within 60 days of receiving the sponsor\u2019s\nlist, the applicant may provide to the sponsor a list of patents\nthat the applicant believes are relevant but that the sponsor\nomitted from its own list, \u00a7262(l)(3)(B)(i), and \u201cshall\nprovide\u201d to the sponsor reasons why it could not be held liable for\ninfringing the relevant patents, \u00a7262(l)(3)(B)(ii). The\napplicant may argue that the relevant patents are invalid,\nunenforceable, or not infringed, or the applicant may agree not to\nmarket the biosimilar until a particular pat-ent has expired.Ibid.The applicant must also respond to the sponsor\u2019s\noffers to license particular patents. \u00a7262(l)(3)(B)(iii).\nThen, within 60 days of receiving the applicant\u2019s responses, the\nsponsor \u201cshall provide\u201d to the applicant its own arguments\nconcerning infringement, enforceability, and validity as to each\nrelevant patent. \u00a7262(l)(3)(C).Following this exchange, the BPCIA channels the\nparties into two phases of patent litigation. In the first phase,\nthe parties collaborate to identify patents that they would like to\nlitigate immediately. The second phase is triggered by the\napplicant\u2019s notice of commercial marketing and involves any patents\nthat were included on the parties\u2019 \u00a7262(l)(3) lists but not\nlitigated in the first phase.At the outset of the first phase, the applicant\nand the sponsor must negotiate to determine which patents included\non the \u00a7262(l)(3) lists will be litigated immediately. See\n\u00a7\u00a7262(l)(4)(A), (l)(6). If they cannot agree, then\nthey must engage in another list exchange. \u00a7262(l)(4)(B).\nThe applicant \u201cshall notify\u201d the sponsor of the number of pat-ents\nit intends to list for litigation, \u00a7262(l)(5)(A), and,\nwithin five days, the parties \u201cshall simultaneously exchange\u201d lists\nof the patents they would like to litigate immediately.\n\u00a7262(l)(5)(B)(i). This process gives the applicant\nsubstantial control over the scope of the first phase of\nlitigation: The number of patents on the sponsor\u2019s list is limited\nto the number contained in the applicant\u2019s list, though the sponsor\nalways has the right to list at least one patent.\n\u00a7262(l)(5)(B)(ii).The parties then proceed to litigate\ninfringement with respect to the patents they agreed to litigate\nor, if they failed to agree, the patents contained on the lists\nthey simultaneously exchanged under \u00a7262(l)(5).\n\u00a7\u00a7262(l)(6)(A), (B). Section 271(e)(2)(C)(i) facilitates\nthis first phase of litigation by making it an act of artificial\ninfringement, with respect to any patent included on the parties\u2019\n\u00a7262(l)(3) lists, to submit an application for a license\nfrom the FDA. The sponsor \u201cshall bring an action\u201d in court within\n30 days of the date of agreement or the simultaneous list exchange.\n\u00a7\u00a7262(l)(6)(A), (B).If the sponsor brings a timely\naction and prevails, it may obtain a rem-edy provided by\n\u00a7271(e)(4).The second phase of litigation involves patents\nthat were included on the original \u00a7262(l)(3) lists but not\nlitigated in the first phase (and any patents that the sponsor\nacquired after the \u00a7262(l)(3) exchange occurred and added to\nthe lists, see \u00a7262(l)(7)). The second phase is commenced by\nthe applicant\u2019s notice of commercial marketing, which the applicant\n\u201cshall provide\u201d to the sponsor \u201cnot later than 180 days before the\ndate of the first commercial marketing of the biological product\nlicensed under subsection (k).\u201d \u00a7262(l)(8)(A). The BPCIA\nbars any declaratory judgment action prior to this notice.\n\u00a7262(l)(9)(A) (prohibiting, in situations where the parties\nhave complied with each step of the BPCIA process, either the\nsponsor or the applicant from seeking a \u201cdeclaration of\ninfringement, validity, or enforceability of any patent\u201d that was\nincluded on the \u00a7262(l)(3) lists but not litigated in the\nfirst phase \u201cprior to the date notice is received under paragraph\n(8)(A)\u201d). Because the applicant (subject to certain constraints)\nchooses when to begin commercial marketing and when to give notice,\nit wields substantial control over the timing of the second phase\nof litigation. The second question presented is whether notice is\neffective if an appli-cant provides it prior to the FDA\u2019s decision\nto license the biosimilar.In this second phase of litigation,eitherparty may sue for declaratory relief. See\n\u00a7262(l)(9)(A). In addition, prior to the date of first\ncommercial marketing, the sponsor may \u201cseek a preliminary\ninjunction prohibiting the [biosimilar] applicant from engaging in\nthe commercial manufacture or sale of [the biosimilar] until the\ncourt decides the issue of patent validity, enforcement, and\ninfringement with respect to any patent that\u201d was included on the\n\u00a7262(l)(3) lists but not litigated in the first phase.\n\u00a7262(l)(8)(B).DIf the parties comply with each step outlined\nin the BPCIA, they will have the opportunity to litigate the\nrelevant patents before the biosimilar is marketed. To encourage\nparties to comply with its procedural requirements, the BPCIA\nincludes various consequences for failing to do so. Two of the\nBPCIA\u2019s remedial provisions are at issue here. Under\n\u00a7262(l)(9)(C), if an applicant fails to provide its\napplication and manufacturing information to the sponsor\u2014thus\neffectively pretermitting the entire two-phase litigation\nprocess\u2014then the sponsor, but not the applicant, may immediately\nbring an action \u201cfor a declaration of infringement, validity, or\nenforceability of any patent that claims the biological product or\na use of the biological product.\u201d Section 271(e)(2)(C)(ii)\nfacilitates this action by making it an artificial act of\ninfringement, with respect to any patent thatcouldhave\nbeen included on the \u00a7262(l)(3) lists, to submit a\nbiosimilar application. Similarly, when an applicant provides the\napplication and manufacturing information but fails to complete a\nsubsequent step, \u00a7262(l)(9)(B) provides that the sponsor,\nbut not the applicant, may bring a declaratory-judgment action with\nrespect to any patent included on the sponsor\u2019s\n\u00a7262(l)(3)(A) list of patents (as well as those it acquired\nlater and added to the list). As noted, it is an act of artificial\ninfringement, with respect to any patent on the \u00a7262(l)(3)\nlists, to submit an application to the FDA. See\n\u00a7271(e)(2)(C)(i).IIThese cases concern filgrastim, a biologic\nused to stimulate the production of white blood cells. Amgen, the\nrespondent in No. 15\u20131039 and the petitioner in No. 15\u20131195, has\nmarketed a filgrastim product called Neupogen since 1991 and claims\nto hold patents on methods of manufacturing and using filgrastim.\nIn May 2014, Sandoz, the petitioner in No. 15\u20131039 and the\nrespondent in No.\u00a015\u20131195, filed an application with the FDA\nseeking approval to market a filgrastim biosimilar under the brand\nname Zarxio, with Neupogen as the reference product. The FDA\ninformed Sandoz on July 7, 2014, that it had accepted the\napplication for review. One day later, Sandoz notified Amgen both\nthat it had submitted an application and that it intended to begin\nmarketing Zarxio immediately upon receiving FDA approval, which it\nexpected in the first half of 2015. Sandoz later confirmed that it\ndid not intend to provide the requisite application and\nmanufacturing information under \u00a7262(l)(2)(A) and informed\nAmgen that Amgen could sue for infringement immediately under\n\u00a7262(l)(9)(C).In October 2014, Amgen sued Sandoz for patent\ninfringement. Amgen also asserted two claims under California\u2019s\nunfair competition law, which prohibits \u201cany unlawful\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. business act or practice.\u201d Cal. Bus. & Prof.\nCode Ann. \u00a717200 (West 2008). A \u201cbusiness act or practice\u201d is\n\u201cunlawful\u201d under the unfair competition law if it violates a rule\ncontained in some other state or federal statute.Rosev.Bank of America, N.\u00a0A., 57 Cal. 4th 390, 396, 304\nP.\u00a03d 181, 185 (2013). Amgen alleged that Sandoz engaged in\n\u201cunlawful\u201d conduct when it failed to provide its application and\nmanufacturing information under \u00a7262(l)(2)(A), and when it\nprovided notice of commercial marketing under \u00a7262(l)(8)(A)\nbefore, rather than after, the FDA licensed its biosimilar. Amgen\nsought injunctions to enforce both requirements. Sandoz\ncounterclaimed for declaratory judgments that the asserted pat-ent\nwas invalid and not infringed and that it had not violated the\nBPCIA.While the case was pending in the District\nCourt, the FDA licensed Zarxio, and Sandoz provided Amgen a further\nnotice of commercial marketing. The District Court subsequently\ngranted partial judgment on the pleadings to Sandoz on its BPCIA\ncounterclaims and dismissed Amgen\u2019s unfair competition claims with\nprejudice. 2015 WL 1264756, *7\u2013*9 (ND Cal., Mar. 19, 2015). After\nthe District Court entered final judgment as to these claims, Amgen\nappealed to the Federal Circuit, which granted an injunction\npending appeal against the commercial marketing of Zarxio.A divided Federal Circuit affirmed in part,\nvacated in part, and remanded. First, the court affirmed the\ndismissal of Amgen\u2019s state-law claim based on Sandoz\u2019s alleged\nviolation of \u00a7262(l)(2)(A). It held that Sandoz did not\nviolate the BPCIA in failing to disclose its application and\nmanufacturing information. It further held that the remedies\ncontained in the BPCIA are the exclusive remedies for an\napplicant\u2019s failure to comply with \u00a7262(l)(2)(A). 794\nF.\u00a03d 1347, 1357, 1360 (2015).Second, the court held that an applicant may\nprovide effective notice of commercial marketing onlyafterthe FDA has licensed the biosimilar.Id.,at 1358.\nAccord-ingly, the 180-day clock began after Sandoz\u2019s second,\npost-licensure notice. The Federal Circuit further concluded that\nthe notice requirement is mandatory and extended its injunction\npending appeal to bar Sandoz from marketing Zarxio until 180 days\nafter the date it provided its second notice.Id.,at\n1360\u20131361.We granted Sandoz\u2019s petition for certiorari, No.\n15\u20131039, and Amgen\u2019s conditional cross-petition for certiorari,\nNo.\u00a015\u20131195, and consolidated the cases. 580 U.\u00a0S. ___\n(2017).IIIThe first question we must answer is whether\n\u00a7262(l)(2)(A)\u2019s requirement that an applicant provide the\nsponsor with its application and manufacturing information is\nenforceable by an injunction under either federal or state law.AWe agree with the Federal Circuit that an\ninjunction under federal law is not available to enforce\n\u00a7262(l)(2)(A), though for slightly different reasons than\nthose provided by the court below. The Federal Circuit held that \u201c\n42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7262(l)(9)(C) and 35\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7271(e) expressly provide the only remedies\u201d for\na violation of \u00a7262(l)(2)(A), 794 F.\u00a03d, at 1357, and\nneither of those provisions authorizes a court to compel compliance\nwith \u00a7262(l)(2)(A). In concluding that the remedies\nspecified in the BPCIA are exclusive, the Federal Circuit relied\nprimarily on \u00a7271(e)(4), which states that it provides \u201c\u00a0\u2018the\nonly remedies which may be granted by a court for an act of\n[artificial] infringement.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId.,at 1356 (emphasis\ndeleted).The flaw in the Federal Circuit\u2019s reasoning is\nthat Sandoz\u2019s failure to disclose its application and manufacturing\ninformation was not an act of artificial infringement, and thus was\nnot remediable under \u00a7271(e)(4). Submitting an application\nconstitutes an act of artificial infringement. See\n\u00a7\u00a7271(e)(2)(C)(i), (ii) (\u201cIt shall be an act of infringement to\nsubmit .\u00a0.\u00a0. an application seeking approval of a\nbiological product\u201d). Failing to disclose the application and\nmanufacturing information under \u00a7262(l)(2)(A) does not.In reaching the opposite conclusion, the Federal\nCircuit relied on \u00a7271(e)(2)(C)(ii), which states that \u201c[i]t shall\nbe an act of infringement to submit[,]if the applicant for the\napplication fails to provide the application and information\nrequired under [\u00a7262(l)(2)(A)], an application seeking approval\nof a biological product for a patent that could be identified\npursuant to [\u00a7262(l)(3)(A)(i)].\u201d (Emphasis added.) The court\nappeared to conclude, based on the italicized language, that an\napplicant\u2019s noncompliance with \u00a7262(l)(2)(A) is an element\nof the act of artificial infringement (along with the submission of\nthe application). 794 F.\u00a03d, at 1356. We disagree. The\nitalicized language merely assists in identifying which patents\nwill be the subject of the artificial infringement suit. It does\nnot define the act of artificial infringement itself.This conclusion follows from the structure of\n\u00a7271(e)(2)(C). Clause (i) of \u00a7271(e)(2)(C) defines artificial\ninfringement in the situation where the parties proceed through the\nlist exchange process and the patents subject to suit are those\ncontained in the \u00a7262(l)(3) lists, as supplemented under\n\u00a7262(l)(7). That clause provides that it is an act of\nartificial infringement to submit, \u201cwith respect to a patent\nthat is identified in the list of patents described in [\u00a7262(l)(3)]\n(including as provided under [\u00a7262(l)(7)]), an application\nseeking approval of a biological product.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Clause\n(ii) of \u00a7271(e)(2)(C), in contrast, defines artificial infringement\nin the situation where an applicant fails to disclose its\napplication and manufacturing information altogether and the\nparties never prepare the \u00a7262(l)(3) lists. That clause\nprovides that the submission of the application represents an act\nof artificial infringement with respect to any patent thatcouldhave been included on the lists.In this way, the two clauses of \u00a7271(e)(2)(C)\nwork in tandem. They both treat submission of the application as\nthe act of artificial infringement for which \u00a7271(e)(4) provides\nthe remedies. And they both identify the patents subject to suit,\nalthough by different means depending on whether the applicant\ndisclosed its application and manufacturing information under\n\u00a7262(l)(2)(A). If the applicant made the disclosures, clause\n(i) applies; if it did not, clause (ii) applies. In neither\ninstance is the applicant\u2019s failure to provide its application and\nmanufacturing information an element of the act of artificial\ninfringement, and in neither instance does \u00a7271(e)(4) provide a\nremedy for that failure. See Brief for Amgen Inc. et\u00a0al. 66\u201367\n(conceding both points).A separate provision of \u00a7262, however, does\nprovide a remedy for an applicant\u2019s failure to turn over its\napplication and manufacturing information. When an applicant fails\nto comply with \u00a7262(l)(2)(A), \u00a7262(l)(9)(C)\nauthorizes the sponsor, but not the applicant, to bring an\nimmediate declaratory-judgment action for artificial infringement\nas defined in \u00a7271(e)(2)(C)(ii). Section 262(l)(9)(C) thus\nvests in the sponsor the control that the applicant would otherwise\nhave exercised over the scope and timing of the patent litigation.\nIt also deprives the applicant of the certainty that it could have\nobtained by bringing a declaratory-judgment action prior to\nmarketing its product.The remedy provided by \u00a7262(l)(9)(C)\nexcludes all other federal remedies, including injunctive relief.\nWhere, as here, \u201ca statute expressly provides a remedy, courts must\nbe especially reluctant to provide additional remedies.\u201dKarahaliosv.Federal Employees, 489 U.\u00a0S. 527,\n533 (1989) . The BPCIA\u2019s \u201ccarefully crafted and detailed\nenforcement scheme provides strong evidence that Congress didnotintend to authorize other remedies that it simply forgot\nto incorporate expressly.\u201dGreat-West Life & Annu-ity Ins.\nCo.v.Knudson, 534 U.\u00a0S. 204, 209 (2002) (internal\nquotation marks omitted). The presence of \u00a7262(l)(9)(C),\ncoupled with the absence of any other textually specified remedies,\nindicates that Congress did not intend sponsors to have access to\ninjunctive relief, at least as a matter of federal law, to enforce\nthe disclosure requirement.Statutory context further confirms that Congress\ndid not authorize courts to enforce \u00a7262(l)(2)(A) by\ninjunction. Section 262(l)(1)(H) provides that \u201cthe court\nshall consider immediate injunctive relief to be an appropriate and\nnecessary remedy for any violation or threatened violation\u201d of the\nrules governing the confidentiality of information disclosed under\n\u00a7262(l). We assume that Congress acted intentionally when it\nprovided an injunctive remedy for breach of the confidentiality\nrequirements but not for breach of \u00a7262(l)(2)(A)\u2019s\ndisclosure requirement. Cf.Touche Ross & Co.v.Redington, 442 U.\u00a0S. 560, 572 (1979) (\u201c[W]hen Congress\nwished to provide a private damage remedy, it knew how to do so and\ndid so expressly\u201d).[2]\nAccordingly, the Federal Circuit properly declined to grant an\ninjunction under federal law.BThe Federal Circuit rejected Amgen\u2019s request\nfor an injunction under state law for two reasons. First, it\ninterpreted California\u2019s unfair competition law not to provide a\nremedy when the underlying statute specifies an \u201cexpressly\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. exclusive\u201d remedy. 794 F.\u00a03d, at 1360 (citing\nCal. Bus. & Prof. Code Ann. \u00a717205;Loefflerv.Target Corp., 58 Cal. 4th 1081, 1125\u20131126, 324 P.\u00a03d\n50, 76 (2014)). It further held that \u00a7271(e)(4), by its text,\n\u201cprovides \u2018the only remedies\u2019\u00a0\u201d for an applicant\u2019s failure to\ndisclose its application and manufacturing information. 794\nF.\u00a03d, at 1360 (quoting \u00a7271(e)(4)). The court thus concluded\nthat no state remedy was available for Sandoz\u2019s alleged violation\nof \u00a7262(l)(2)(A) under the terms of California\u2019s unfair\ncompetition law.This state-law holding rests on an incorrect\ninterpretation of federal law. As we have explained, failure to\ncomply with \u00a7262(l)(2)(A) is not an act of artificial\ninfringement. Because \u00a7271(e)(4) provides remedies only for\nartificial infringement, it provides no remedy at all, much less an\n\u201cexpressly .\u00a0.\u00a0. exclusive\u201d one, for Sandoz\u2019s failure to\ncomply with \u00a7262(l)(2)(A).Second, the Federal Circuit held in the\nalternative that Sandoz\u2019s failure to disclose its application and\nmanufacturing information was not \u201cunlawful\u201d under California\u2019s\nunfair competition law. In the court\u2019s view, when an applicant\ndeclines to provide its application and manufacturing information\nto the sponsor, it takes a path \u201cexpressly contemplated by\u201d\n\u00a7262(l)(9)(C) and \u00a7271(e)(2)(C)(ii) and thus does not\nviolate the BPCIA. 794 F.\u00a03d, at 1357, 1360. In their briefs\nbefore this Court, the parties frame this issue as whether the\n\u00a7262(l)(2)(A) requirement is mandatory in all circumstances,\nsee Brief for Amgen Inc. et\u00a0al. 58, or merely a condition\nprecedent to the information exchange process, see Reply Brief for\nSandoz Inc. 33. If it is only a condition precedent, then an\napplicant effectively has the option to withhold its application\nand manufacturing information and does not commit an \u201cunlawful\u201d act\nin doing so.We decline to resolve this particular dispute\ndefinitively because it does not present a question of federal law.\nThe BPCIA, standing alone, does not require a court to decide\nwhether \u00a7262(l)(2)(A) is mandatory or conditional; the court\nneed only determine whether the applicant supplied the sponsor with\nthe information required under \u00a7262(l)(2)(A). If the\napplicant failed to provide that information, then the sponsor, but\nnot the applicant, could bring an immediate declaratory-judgment\naction pursuant to \u00a7262(l)(9)(C). The parties in these cases\nagree\u2014as did the Federal Circuit\u2014that Sandoz failed to comply with\n\u00a7262(l)(2)(A), thus subjecting itself to that consequence.\nThere is no dispute about how the federal scheme actually works,\nand thus nothing for us to decide as a matter of federal law. The\nmandatory or conditional nature of the BPCIA\u2019s requirements mattersonlyfor purposes of California\u2019s unfair competition law,\nwhich penalizes \u201cunlawful\u201d conduct. Whether Sandoz\u2019s conduct was\n\u201cunlawful\u201d under the unfair competition law is a state-law\nquestion, and the court below erred in attempting to answer that\nquestion by referring to the BPCIA alone.On remand, the Federal Circuit should determine\nwhether California law would treat noncompliance with\n\u00a7262(l)(2)(A) as \u201cunlawful.\u201d If the answer is yes, then the\ncourt should proceed to determine whether the BPCIA pre-empts any\nadditional remedy available under state law for an applicant\u2019s\nfailure to comply with \u00a7262(l)(2)(A) (and whether Sandoz has\nforfeited any pre-emption defense, see 794 F.\u00a03d, at 1360,\nn.\u00a05). The court is also of course free to address the\npre-emption question first by assuming that a remedy under state\nlaw exists.IVThe second question at issue in these cases is\nwhether an applicant must provide noticeafterthe FDA\nlicenses its biosimilar, or if it may also provide effective notice\nbefore licensure. Section 262(l)(8)(A) states that the\napplicant \u201cshall provide notice to the reference product sponsor\nnot later than 180 days before the date of the first commercial\nmarketing of the biological product licensed under subsection (k).\u201d\nThe Federal Circuit held that an applicant\u2019s biosimilar must\nalready be \u201clicensed\u201d at the time the applicant gives notice. 794\nF.\u00a03d, at 1358.We disagree. The applicant must give \u201cnotice\u201d at\nleast 180 days \u201cbefore the date of the first commercial marketing.\u201d\n\u201c[C]ommercial marketing,\u201d in turn, must be \u201cof the biological\nproduct licensed under subsection (k).\u201d \u00a7262(l)(8)(A).\nBecause this latter phrase modifies \u201ccommercial marketing\u201d rather\nthan \u201cnotice,\u201d \u201ccommercial marketing\u201d is the point in time by which\nthe biosimilar must be \u201clicensed.\u201d The statute\u2019s use of the word\n\u201clicensed\u201d merely reflects the fact that, on the \u201cdate of the first\ncommercial marketing,\u201d the product must be \u201clicensed.\u201d See\n\u00a7262(a)(1)(A). Accordingly, the applicant may provide notice either\nbefore or after receiving FDA approval.Statutory context confirms this interpretation.\nSection 262(l)(8)(A) contains a single timing requirement:\nThe applicant must provide notice at least 180 days prior to\nmarketing its biosimilar. The Federal Circuit, however, interpreted\nthe provision to impose two timing requirements: The applicant must\nprovide notice after the FDA licenses the biosimilarandat\nleast 180 days before the applicant markets the biosimilar. An\nadjacent provision expressly sets forth just that type of dual\ntiming requirement. See \u00a7262(l)(8)(B) (\u201cAfterreceiving notice under subparagraph (A) andbeforesuch date\nof the first commercial marketing of such biological product, the\nreference product sponsor may seek a preliminary injunction\u201d\n(emphasis added)). But Congress did not use that structure in\n\u00a7262(l)(8)(A). \u201cHad Congress intended to\u201d impose two timing\nrequirements in \u00a7262(l)(8)(A), \u201cit presumably would have\ndone so expressly as it did in the immediately following\u201d\nsubparagraph.Russellov.United States, 464\nU.\u00a0S. 16, 23 (1983) .We are not persuaded by Amgen\u2019s arguments to the\ncontrary. Amgen points out that other provisions refer to\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018the biological productthat is the subject\nof\u2019\u00a0\u201d the application, rather than the \u201c\u00a0\u2018biological\nproductlicensed undersubsection (k).\u2019\u00a0\u201d Brief for\nAmgen Inc. et\u00a0al. 28 (emphasis added). In its view, this\nvariation \u201cis a strong textual indication that\n\u00a7262(l)(8)(A), unlike the other provisions, refers to a\nproduct that has already been \u2018licensed\u2019 by the FDA.\u201dIbid.Amgen\u2019s interpretation is not necessary to\nharmonize Congress\u2019 use of the two different phrases. The provision\nupon which Amgen primarily relies (and that is generally\nillustrative of the other provisions it cites) requires the\napplicant to explain why the sponsor\u2019s patents are \u201c\u00a0\u2018invalid,\nunenforceable, or will not be infringed by the commercial marketing\nof the biological product that is the subject of the subsection (k)\napplication.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId.,at 29\u201330 (quoting\n\u00a7262(l)(3)(B)(ii)(I); emphasis deleted). This provision uses\nthe phrase \u201csubject of the subsection (k) application\u201d rather than\n\u201cproduct licensed under subsection (k)\u201d because the applicant can\nevaluate validity, enforceability, and infringement with respect to\nthe biosimilar only as it existswhen the applicant is\nconducting the evaluation, which it does before licensure. The\napplicant cannot make the same evaluation with respect to the\nbiosimilar as it will exist after licensure, because the\nbiosimilar\u2019s specifications may change during the application\nprocess. See,e.g.,794 F.\u00a03d, at 1358. In contrast,\nnothing in \u00a7262(l)(8)(A) turns on the precise status or\ncharacteristics of the biosimilar application.Amgen also advances a host of policy arguments\nthat prelicensure notice is undesirable. See Brief for Amgen Inc.\net\u00a0al. 35\u201342. Sandoz and the Government, in turn, respond with\ntheir own bevy of arguments that Amgen\u2019s concerns are misplaced and\nthat prelicensure notice affirmatively furthers Congress\u2019 intent.\nSee Brief for Sandoz Inc. 39\u201342, 56; Brief for United States asAmicus Curiae28\u201329. The plausibility of the contentions on\nboth sides illustrates why such disputes are appropriately\naddressed to Congress, not the courts. Even if we were persuaded\nthat Amgen had the better of the policy arguments, those arguments\ncould not overcome the statute\u2019s plain language, which is our\n\u201cprimary guide\u201d to Congress\u2019 preferred policy.McFarlandv.Scott, 512 U.\u00a0S. 849, 865 (1994) (Thomas, J.,\ndissenting).In sum, because Sandoz fully complied with\n\u00a7262(l)(8)(A) when it first gave notice (before licensure)\nin July 2014, the Federal Circuit erred in issuing a federal\ninjunction prohibiting Sandoz from marketing Zarxio until 180 days\nafter licensure. Furthermore, because Amgen\u2019s request for state-law\nrelief is predicated on its argument that the BPCIA forbids\nprelicensure notice, its claim under California\u2019s unfair\ncompetition law also fails. We accordingly reverse the Federal\nCircuit\u2019s judgment as to the notice provision.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the\nCourt of Appeals is vacated in part and reversed in part, and the\ncases are remanded for further proceedings consistent with this\nopinion.It is so ordered.Notes1FDA, What Are \u201cBiologics\u201d\nQuestions and Answers (Aug. 5, 2015),\nhttp://www.fda.gov/aboutfda/centersoffices/officeofmedicalproductsandtobacco\u00a0/cber\u00a0/ucm133077.htm\n(as last visited June 6, 2017).2In holding that\n\u00a7262(l)(9)(C) represents the exclusive remedy for an\napplicant\u2019s failure to provide its application and manufacturing\ninformation, we express no view on whether a district court could\ntake into account an applicant\u2019s violation of \u00a7262(l)(2)(A)\n(or any other BPCIA procedural requirement) in deciding whether to\ngrant a preliminary injunction under 35 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7271(e)(4)(B) or \u00a7283 against marketing the biosimilar.
