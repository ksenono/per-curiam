GONZALES,Attorney Generalon writ of certiorari to the united\nstates court of appeals for the eighth circuit[December 5, 2006]Justice Thomas,\ndissenting.Jose Antonio Lopez\npleaded guilty to aiding and abetting the possession of cocaine, a\nfelony under South Dakota law. The Court holds that Lopez\u2019s\nconviction does not constitute an \u201caggravated felony\u201d because\nfederal law would classify Lopez\u2019s possession offense as a\nmisdemeanor. I respectfully dissent.IThe Immigration\nand Nationality Act (INA) provides that \u201c[a]ny alien who is\nconvicted of an aggravated felony at any time after admission is\ndeportable.\u201d 8 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71227(a)(2)(A)(iii). As relevant to\nthis case, the INA defines an \u201caggravated felony\u201d as \u201cillicit\ntrafficking in a controlled substance \u2026 including a drug\ntrafficking crime (as defined in section 924(c) of title 18).\u201d\n\u00a71101(a)(43)(B). And \u201cthe term \u2018drug trafficking crime\u2019 means any\nfelony punishable under the Controlled Substances\nAct\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d 18 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7924(c)(2).Lopez\u2019s state\nfelony offense qualifies as a \u201cdrug trafficking crime\u201d as defined\nin \u00a7924(c)(2). A plain reading of this definition identifies two\nelements: First, the offense must be a felony; second, the offense\nmust be capable of punishment under the Controlled Substances Act\n(CSA). No one disputes that South Dakota punishes Lopez\u2019s crime as\na felony. See S.\u00a0D. Codified Laws \u00a722\u201342\u20135 (1988). Likewise,\nno one disputes that the offense was capable of punishment under\nthe CSA. See 21 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7844(a). Lopez\u2019s possession offense\ntherefore satisfies both elements, and the inquiry should end\nthere.The Court, however, takes the\ninquiry further by reasoning that onlyfederalfelonies\nqualify as drug trafficking crimes. According to the Court, the\ndefinition of drug trafficking crime contains an implied\nlimitation: \u201cany felony punishable [as a felony] under the\u201d CSA.\nThe text does not support this interpretation. Most obviously, the\nlanguage \u201cas a felony\u201d appears nowhere in \u00a7924(c)(2). Without\ndoubt, Congress could have written the definition with this\nlimitation, but it did not.Furthermore, Lopez\u2019s suggested\naddition conflicts with the clear meaning of \u00a7924(c)(2), which\nextends to both state and federal felonies. Specifically, the\ndefinition broadly encompasses \u201canyfelony\u201d capable of\nbeing punished under the CSA. 18 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7924(c)(2) (emphasis\nadded). \u201cRead naturally, the word \u2018any\u2019 has an expansive meaning\n\u2026\u00a0.\u201dUnited Statesv.Gonzales,520 U. S. 1, 5 (1997)\n(plurality opinion); see alsoSmallv.United\nStates,544 U.\nS. 385, 397 (2005) (Thomas, J., dissenting) (\u201cThe broad phrase\n\u2018any court\u2019 unambiguously includes all judicial bodies with\njurisdiction to impose the requisite conviction\u00a0\u2026\u201d (footnote\nomitted)). The term \u201cfelony\u201d takes its meaning from Title 18, which\nclassifies crimes as felonies when punishable by death or greater\nthan one year of imprisonment. \u00a73559(a). \u201c[A]ny felony\u201d therefore\nincludes both federal and state felonies: The classification\ndepends only on the authorized term of imprisonment. Accordingly,\nby the plain terms of \u00a7924(c)(2), conduct prohibited by the CSA may\nqualify as a \u201cdrug trafficking crime\u201d if under either federal law\nor state law the conduct is punishable by more than one year of\nimprisonment.This interpretation finds\nsupport in other provisions in which Congress placed limits on the\ntypes of drug trafficking crimes eligible for consideration. In\nparticular, \u00a7924(c)(1)(A) proscribes the use or possession of a\nfirearm \u201cduring and in relation to any \u2026 drug trafficking crime \u2026for which the person may be prosecuted in a court of the United\nStates\u2026\u00a0.\u201d (emphasis added); see also 18 U.\nS.\u00a0C.\u00a0A. \u00a7924(c)(5) (Supp. 2006) (using identical\nlanguage in proscribing the use or possession of \u201carmor piercing\nammunition\u201d). The Court has previously interpreted this language to\nlimit \u201cany \u2026 drug trafficking crime\u201d to federal crimes.Gonzales,supra,at 5. This language, therefore,\nacts as a jurisdictional limitation, carving out the subset offederaldrug trafficking crimes and making only those\neligible for use in \u00a7\u00a7924(c)(1)(A) and 924(c)(5). No similar\nfederal-crime limitation appears in \u00a7924(c)(2). Interpreting the\nterm \u201cdrug trafficking crime,\u201d as defined in \u00a7924(c)(2), to reach\nonly federal felonies would render superfluous the federal-crime\nlimitations in these other provisions. SeeDuncanv.Walker,533\nU. S. 167, 174 (2001) (plurality opinion) (counseling against\ninterpretations that result in surplus language).[Footnote 1]This interpretation also finds\nsupport in the INA, which lists \u201cillicit trafficking\u201d and its\nsubset of \u201cdrug trafficking crime[s]\u201d as aggravated felonies. 8 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a71101(a)(43)(B). The INA considers these offenses\naggravated felonies \u201cwhether in violation of Federal or State\nlaw\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d \u00a71101(a)(43) (penultimate sentence). Thus, by\nincorporating \u00a7924(c)(2)\u2019s definition of \u201cdrug trafficking crime,\u201d\nthe INA supports and confirms the conclusion that the definition of\n\u201cdrug trafficking crime\u201d applies to both federal and state\nfelonies.Moreover, the INA isolates the\nrelevant inquiry to the prosecuting jurisdiction.\nSection\u00a01227(a)(2)(A)(iii) of Title 8 makes an alien eligible\nfor deportation only upon aconvictionfor an \u201caggravated\nfelony.\u201d The conviction requirement suggests that the jurisdiction\nissuing the conviction determines whether the offense is a felony.\nThis result makes sense. When faced with an actual conviction, it\nwould be unusual to ask, hypothetically, whether that conviction\nwould have been a felony in a different jurisdiction. Furthermore,\nthat hypothetical inquiry could cause significant inconsistencies.\nFor instance, where a State convicts an alien of a misdemeanor drug\ncrime, but federal law classifies the crime as a felony, the\nmisdemeanor conviction would constitute an aggravated felony. This\nanomaly does not arise when relying on the prosecuting\njurisdiction\u2019s classification of the crime.IIThe Court\u2019s\napproach is unpersuasive. At the outset of its analysis, the Court\navers that it must look to the ordinary meaning of \u201cillicit\ntrafficking\u201d because \u201cthe statutes in play do not define the term.\u201dAnte, at 5. That statement is incorrect. Section\n1101(a)(43)(B) of Title 8 clearly defines \u201cillicit trafficking in a\ncontrolled substance,\u201d at least in part, as \u201ca drug trafficking\ncrime (as defined in section 924(c) of title 18).\u201d\n(Emphasis added.) Therefore, whatever else \u201cillicit trafficking\u201d\nmight mean, it must include anything defined as a \u201cdrug trafficking\ncrime\u201d in \u00a7924(c)(2). Rather than grappling with this definition of\nthe relevant term, the Court instead sets up a conflicting strawman\ndefinition.The majority\nstates that the ordinary meaning of \u201cillicit trafficking\u201d involves\n\u201csome sort of commercial dealing.\u201dAnte, at 5. Because\nmere possession does not constitute commercial dealing, the Court\nconcludes that Lopez\u2019s possession offense cannot qualify as an\n\u201cillicit trafficking\u201d offense\u2014or, by implication, a \u201cdrug\ntrafficking crime.\u201d Yet even the Court admits that the term \u201cdrug\ntrafficking crime\u201d includes federal drug felonies, several of which\nare mere possession offenses. See 21 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7844(a)\n(possession of more than five grams of cocaine base, possession of\nflunitrazepam, and repeat possession offenses). If the Court\nrecognizes, in light of \u00a7924(c)(2), some mere possession offenses\nunder the umbrella of \u201cillicit trafficking,\u201d it cannot reject\nLopez\u2019s conviction out of hand. Yet the Court downplays these \u201cfew\nexceptions\u201d in two footnotes, concluding that \u201cthis coerced\ninclusion of a few possession offenses\u201d gives no reason to\n\u201coverride [the] ordinary meaning\u201d of \u201cillicit trafficking.\u201dAnte, at 6, nn.\u00a04 and 6.The inconsistency deserves more\nthan the Court\u2019s passing reference. By encompassing repeat\npossession offenses, the term \u201cillicit trafficking\u201d includes far\nmore than \u201ca few\u201d offenses outside of its ordinary meaning. It must\nincludeeverytype of possession offense under the CSA, so\nlong as the offender has had a previous possession offense. If\ndefining \u201cillicit trafficking\u201d to include the entire range of\nunlawful possession does not provide a \u201cclear statutory command to\noverride ordinary meaning,\u201d I do not know what would.[Footnote 2]The Court, however, gives only\nfleeting consideration to the text of \u00a7924(c)(2) itself. After\nreferencing the phrase \u201cfelony punishable under\u201d the CSA, the Court\nasks \u201cwhere else would one naturally look\u201d other than the CSA to\ndetermine whether a felony qualifies as a drug trafficking crime.Ante, at 7. In response to the Court\u2019s rhetorical\nquestion, I suggest that one might naturally look to the conviction\nitself to determine whether it is a felony. When presented with an\nactual conviction, one would not expect to look to a hypothetical\nprosecution to determine whether an offender has committed a\nfelony.Continuing to avoid the text of\n\u00a7924(c)(2), the Court instead focuses on what the statute does not\nsay. It concludes that Congress could have expressly referenced\nstate law as in \u00a7924(g)(3) and (k)(2).Ante, at 7. The\nresponse, of course, is that Congress could just as well have\ndefined a \u201cdrug trafficking crime\u201d as \u201cany felony punishableas\na felonyunder the CSA.\u201d Rejoining, the Court resorts to an\n\u201cinstinctiv[e] understand[ing]\u201d that the statutory definition\nactually means \u201cfelony as defined by the Act.\u201dIbid.\nInstinct notwithstanding, we must interpret what Congress actually\nwrote, not what it could have written.Furthermore, the Court\u2019s\n\u201cinstinct\u201d to interpret \u00a7924(c)(2) to mean \u201cfelony as defined by\u201d\nthe CSA creates an unnecessary ambiguity in the meaning of\n\u201cfelony.\u201d The CSA defines \u201cfelony\u201d as \u201cany Federal or State offense\nclassified by applicable Federal or State law as a felony.\u201d 21 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a7802(13).[Footnote\n3] Under the Court\u2019s interpretation, that definition seemingly\nshould apply. The Court concludes otherwise but never resolves the\nambiguity it creates: It instead explains that \u201cfelony\u201d is defined\nby the CSA as something other than the CSA\u2019s definition of\n\u201cfelony.\u201dAnte, at 8, n.\u00a07. That explanation is, at\nbest, unsatisfying.After gliding past the\nstatutory text, the Court expresses concern over the fact that the\nGovernment\u2019s interpretation allows federal immigration law to turn\non varying state criminal classifications. Congress apparently did\nnot share this concern because some definitions of \u201caggravated\nfelony\u201d explicitly turn on the State\u2019s authorized term of\nimprisonment, not a uniform federal classification. See 8 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a71101(a)(43)(F), (G), (J), (P)\u2013(T). Even the Court finds\nthis variance \u201cnot \u2026 all that remarkable.\u201dAnte, at 10.\nThe Court\u2019s real concern therefore has little to do with variations\nin state law. Rather, it worries that \u201ca state criminal\nclassification [may be] at odds with a federal provision.\u201dIbid.But, obviously, if a state offense does not qualify\nunder the definitions in \u00a71101(a)(43), then the offense cannot be\nan \u201caggravated felony.\u201d As shown in Part I, though, nothing about\nLopez\u2019s offense conflicts with the plain language of \u00a7924(c)(2) as\nincorporated into \u00a71101(a)(43)(B). He was convicted of a \u201cfelony,\u201d\nand his offense was \u201cpunishable under the\u201d CSA.The Court also notes apparent\nanomalies in the Government\u2019s approach. It asserts that, under the\nGovernment\u2019s interpretation, a state felony conviction for simple\npossession of less than 30 grams of marijuana could be an\n\u201caggravated felony\u201d even though the INA expressly excludes such an\noffense as grounds for deportation under 8 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a71227(a)(2)(B)(i).Ante, at 10\u201311. The Court\u2019s concern has\nlittle basis in reality. Only one State authorizes more than one\nyear of imprisonment for possession of over 20 grams. See Fla.\nStat. \u00a7\u00a7893.13(6)(a)\u2013(b), 775.082(3)(a)(3) (2006). A few others\nclassify possession of one ounce (or 28.3 grams) as a felony. See,e.g.,Nev. Rev. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7453.336(1)\u2013(2) (2004), (4),\n193.130 (2003). The mere possibility that a case could fall into\nthis small gap and lead to removal provides no ground for the Court\nto depart from the plain meaning of \u00a7924(c)(2).In fact, it is the Court\u2019s\ninterpretation that will have a significant effect on removal\nproceedings involving state possession offenses. Federal law treats\npossession of large quantities of controlled substances as\nfelonious possession with intent to distribute. States frequently\ntreat the same conduct as simple possession offenses, which would\nescape classification as aggravated felonies under the Court\u2019s\ninterpretation. Thus, the Court\u2019s interpretation will result in a\nlarge disparity between the treatment of federal and state\nconvictions for possession of large amounts of drugs. And it is\ndifficult to see why Congress would \u201cauthorize a State to overrule\nits judgment\u201d about possession of large quantities of drugs any\nmore than it would about other possession offenses.Ante,\nat 11.Finally, the Court admits that\nits reading will subject an alien defendant convicted of a state\nmisdemeanor to deportation if his conduct was punishable as a\nfelony under the CSA. Accordingly, even if never convicted of an\nactual felony, an alien defendant becomes eligible for deportation\nbased on a hypothetical federal prosecution. It is at least\nanomalous, if not inconsistent, that an actual misdemeanor may be\nconsidered an \u201caggravated felony.\u201dIIIBecause a plain\nreading of the statute would avoid the ambiguities and anomalies\ncreated by today\u2019s majority opinion, I respectfully\ndissent.Footnote\n1The majority mistakenly\ncontends that my interpretation also renders this language\nsuperfluous.Ante, at 10 n.\u00a09. As I have stated, the\nplain meaning of \u201cdrug trafficking crime\u201d includes two categories\nof felonies\u2014state and federal. For the limiting language in\n\u00a7924(c)(1)(A) to have meaning, it must exclude one of those\ncategories. As a state felony, Lopez\u2019s possession offense does not\nfall within the category of federal drug trafficking crimes.\nConsequently, it is not eligible for use under\n\u00a7924(c)(1)(A).Footnote\n2In its discussion of whether\npossession may constitute \u201ctrafficking,\u201d the Court takes its own\ntrip \u201cthrough the looking glass.\u201d Seeante,at 6.\n\u201cCommerce,\u201d according to the Court, \u201ccertainly \u2026 is no element of\nsimple possession \u2026\u00a0.\u201dAnte, at 5. Not long ago, the\nCourt found the opposite to be true when interpreting the scope of\nCongress\u2019 power under the Commerce Clause. SeeGonzalesv.Raich,545 U.\nS. 1, 22 (2005) (plurality opinion) (concluding that Congress\nmay regulate the mere possession of marijuana as affecting\n\u201ccommerce\u201d). InRaich, the Court fell into the very trap\nit purports to identify today by \u201cturn[ing] simple possession into\n[commerce], just what the English language tells us not to expect.\u201dAnte, at 6; see alsoRaich, supra,at 57\u201358\n(Thomas, J., dissenting). The Court\u2019s broadening of the Commerce\nClause stands in tension with its present narrow interpretation of\n\u201ctrafficking,\u201d which 8 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71101(a)(43)(B) explicitly\nalters to include at least some possession offenses.Footnote\n3Several Courts of Appeals\nlooked to this definition of \u201cfelony\u201d when construing the meaning\nof \u201cdrug trafficking crime.\u201d See,e.g.,United\nStatesv.Wilson, 316 F.\u00a03d 506, 512 (CA4 2003).\nAlthough the Government would clearly prevail under 21 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a7802(13), it has conceded that this definition does not\napply. This concession makes good sense: The definition of \u201cdrug\ntrafficking crime\u201d resides in Title 18, and it is therefore most\nnatural to construe \u201cfelony\u201d as used in that title. See, n.\u00a01,supra. As discussed above, that definition as well\nrequires that a crime be considered a felony if the State defines\nit as a felony.",
