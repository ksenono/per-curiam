S. ____ (2011)SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESNO. 10-188SCHINDLER ELEVATOR CORPORATION, PETI-TIONERv.UNITED STATES ex rel. DANIEL KIRKon writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the second circuit[May 16, 2011]Justice Thomas delivered the\nopinion of the Court.The False Claims Act (FCA), 31 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a73729\u20133733, prohibits submitting false or fraudulent\nclaims for payment to the United States, \u00a73729(a), and authorizesqui tamsuits, in which private parties bring civil\nactions in the Government\u2019s name, \u00a73730(b)(1). This case concerns\nthe FCA\u2019s public disclosure bar, which generally foreclosesqui\ntamsuits that are \u201cbased upon the public disclosure of\nallegations or transactions \u2026 in a congressional, administrative,\nor Government Accounting Office report, hearing, audit, or\ninvestigation.\u201d \u00a73730(e)(4)(A) (footnote omitted).[Footnote 1] We must decide whether a federal\nagency\u2019s written response to a request for records under the\nFreedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7552,\nconstitutes a \u201creport\u201d within the meaning of the public disclosure\nbar. We hold that it does.IPetitioner Schindler Elevator\nCorporation manufactures, installs, and services elevators and\nescalators.[Footnote 2] In\n1989, Schindler acquired Millar Elevator Industries, Inc., and the\ntwo companies merged in 2002.Since 1999, Schindler and the\nUnited States have entered into hundreds of contracts that are\nsubject to the Vietnam Era Veterans\u2019 Readjustment Assistance Act of\n1972 (VEVRAA). That Act requires contractors like Schindler to\nreport certain information to the Secretary of Labor, including how\nmany of its employees are \u201cqualified covered veterans\u201d under the\nstatute. 38 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a74212(d)(1). VEVRAA regulations required\nSchindler to agree in each of its contracts that it would \u201csubmit\nVETS\u2013100 Reports no later than September 30 of each year.\u201d 48 CFR\n\u00a752.222\u201337(c) (2008); see also \u00a722.1310(b).Respondent Daniel Kirk, a United States Army\nveteran who served in Vietnam, was employed by Millar and Schindler\nfrom 1978 until 2003. In August 2003, Kirk resigned from Schindler\nin response to what he saw as Schindler\u2019s efforts to force him\nout.[Footnote 3]In March 2005, Kirk filed this action against\nSchindler under the False Claims Act, which imposes civil penalties\nand treble damages on persons who submit false or fraudulent claims\nfor payment to the United States. 31 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a73729(a). The\nFCA authorizes both civil actions by the Attorney General and\nprivatequi tamactions to enforce its provisions. \u00a73730.\nWhen, as here, the Government chooses not to intervene in aqui\ntamaction, the private relator stands to receive between 25%\nand 30% of the proceeds of the action. \u00a73730(d)(2).In an amended complaint filed in June 2007,\nKirk alleged that Schindler had submitted hundreds of false claims\nfor payment under its Government contracts. According to Kirk,\nSchindler had violated VEVRAA\u2019s reporting requirements by failing\nto file certain required VETS\u2013100 reports and including false\ninformation in those it did file. The company\u2019s claims for payment\nwere false, Kirk alleged, because Schindler had falsely certified\nits compliance with VEVRAA. Kirk did not specify the amount of\ndamages he sought on behalf of the United States, but he asserted\nthat the value of Schindler\u2019s VEVRAA-covered contracts exceeded\n$100 million.To support his allegations, Kirk pointed to\ninformation his wife, Linda Kirk, received from the Department of\nLabor (DOL) in response to three FOIA requests. Mrs. Kirk had\nsought all VETS\u2013100 reports filed by Schindler for the years 1998\nthrough 2006. The DOL responded by letter or e-mail to each request\nwith information about the records found for each year, including\nyears for which no responsive records were located. The DOL\ninformed Mrs. Kirk that it found no VETS\u2013100 reports filed by\nSchindler in 1998, 1999, 2000, 2002, or 2003. For the other years,\nthe DOL provided Mrs. Kirk with copies of the reports filed by\nSchindler, 99 in all.Schindler moved to dismiss on a number of\ngrounds, including that the FCA\u2019s public disclosure bar deprived\nthe District Court of jurisdiction. See \u00a73730(e)(4)(A). The\nDistrict Court granted the motion, concluding that most of Kirk\u2019s\nallegations failed to state a claim and that the remainder were\nbased upon the public disclosure of alle-gations or transactions in\nan administrative \u201creport\u201d or \u201cinvestigation.\u201d 606 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d\n448 (SDNY 2009).The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit\nvacated and remanded. 601 F.\u00a03d 94 (2010). The court\neffectively held that an agency\u2019s response to a FOIA request is\nneither a \u201creport\u201d nor an \u201cinvestigation\u201d within the meaning of the\nFCA\u2019s public disclosure bar. Seeid., at 103\u2013111 (agreeing\nwithUnited States ex rel. Haightv.Catholic\nHealthcare West, 445 F.\u00a03d 1147 (CA9 2006), and\ndisagreeing withUnited States ex rel. Mistick PBTv.Housing Auth. of Pittsburgh, 186 F.\u00a03d 376 (CA3\n1999)). We granted certiorari, 561 U. S. ___ (2010), and now\nreverse and remand.IISchindler argues that \u201creport\u201d in\nthe FCA\u2019s public disclosure bar carries its ordinary meaning and\nthat the DOL\u2019s written responses to Mrs. Kirk\u2019s FOIA requests are\ntherefore \u201creports.\u201d We agree.[Footnote 4]A1Adopted in 1986, the FCA\u2019s public\ndisclosure bar provides:\u201cNo court shall have jurisdiction over an action\nunder this section based upon the public disclosure of allegations\nor transactions in a criminal, civil, or administrative hearing, in\na congressional, administrative, or Government Accounting Office\nreport, hearing, audit, or investigation, or from the news media,\nunless the action is brought by the Attorney General or the person\nbringing the action is an original source of the information.\u201d 31\nU. S.\u00a0C. \u00a73730(e)(4)(A) (footnote omitted).Because the statute does not\ndefine \u201creport,\u201d we look first to the word\u2019s ordinary meaning. SeeGrossv.FBL Financial Services, Inc., 557 U. S.\n___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 7) (\u201cStatutory construction must\nbegin with the language employed by Congress and the assumption\nthat the ordinary meaning of that language accurately expresses the\nlegislative purpose\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted));Asgrow Seed Co.v.Winterboer,513 U. S. 179, 187\n(1995) (\u201cWhen terms used in a statute are undefined, we give them\ntheir ordinary meaning\u201d). A \u201creport\u201d is \u201csomething that gives\ninformation\u201d or a \u201cnotification,\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International\nDictionary 1925 (1986), or \u201c[a]n official or formal statement of\nfacts or proceedings,\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1300 (6th ed. 1990).\nSee also 13 Oxford English Dictionary 650 (2d ed. 1989) (\u201c[a]n\naccount brought by one person to another\u201d); American Heritage\nDictionary 1103 (1981) (\u201c[a]n account or announcement that is\nprepared, presented, or delivered, usually in formal or organized\nform\u201d); Random House Dictionary 1634 (2d ed. 1987) (\u201can account or\nstatement describing in detail an event, situation, or the\nlike\u201d).This broad ordinary meaning of \u201creport\u201d is\nconsistent with the generally broad scope of the FCA\u2019s public\ndisclosure bar. As we explained last Term, to determine the meaning\nof one word in the public disclosure bar, we must consider the\nprovision\u2019s \u201centire text,\u201d read as an \u201cintegrated whole.\u201dGraham County Soil and Water Conservation Dist.v.United States ex rel. Wilson, 559 U. S. ___, ___, ___,\nn.\u00a012 (2010) (slip op., at 8, 12, n.\u00a012); see alsoTylerv.Cain,533 U. S. 656, 662\n(2001) (\u201cWe do not \u2026 construe the meaning of statutory terms in a\nvacuum\u201d). The other sources of public disclosure in \u00a73730(e)(4)(A),\nespecially \u201cnews media,\u201d suggest that the public disclosure bar\nprovides \u201ca broa[d] sweep.\u201dGraham County,supra,at ___ (slip op., at 8). The statute also mentions \u201cadministrative\nhearings\u201d twice, reflecting intent to avoid underinclusiveness even\nat the risk of redundancy.The phrase \u201callegations or transactions\u201d in\n\u00a73730(e) (4)(A) additionally suggests a wide-reaching public\ndisclosure bar. Congress covered not only the disclosure of\n\u201callegations\u201d but also \u201ctransactions,\u201d a term that courts have\nrecognized as having a broad meaning. See,e.g.,Moorev.New York Cotton Exchange,270 U. S. 593, 610\n(1926) (\u201c\u00a0\u2018Transaction\u2019 is a word of flexible meaning\u201d);Hamiltonv.United Healthcare of La., Inc., 310\nF.\u00a03d 385, 391 (CA5 2002) (\u201c[T]he ordinary meaning of the term\n\u2018transaction\u2019 is a broad reference to many different types of\nbusiness dealings between parties\u201d).2Nor is there any textual basis\nfor adopting a narrower definition of \u201creport.\u201d The Court of\nAppeals, in holding that FOIA responses were not \u201creports,\u201d looked\nto the words \u201chearing, audit, or investigation,\u201d and the phrase\n\u201ccriminal, civil, [and] administrative hearings.\u201d It concluded that\nall of these sources \u201cconnote the synthesis of information in an\ninvestigatory context\u201d to \u201cserve some end of the government.\u201d 601\nF.\u00a03d, at 107; cf. Brief for Respondent 30, n.\u00a015 (\u201cEach\nis part of the government\u2019s ongoing effort to fight fraud\u201d).\nApplying thenoscitur a sociiscanon, the Court of Appeals\nthen determined that these \u201c\u00a0\u2018neighboring words\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nmandated a narrower meaning for \u201creport\u201d than its ordinary meaning.\n601 F.\u00a03d, at 107.The Court of Appeals committed\nthe very error we reversed inGraham County. Like the\nFourth Circuit in that case, the Second Circuit here applied thenoscitur a sociiscanon only to the immediately\nsurrounding words, to the exclusion of the rest of the statute. See\n601 F.\u00a03d, at 107, n.\u00a06. We emphasized inGraham\nCountythat \u201callof the sources [of public\ndisclosure] listed in \u00a73730(e)(4)(A) provide interpretive\nguidance.\u201d 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 8). When all of the\nsources are considered, the reference to \u201cnews media\u201d\u2014which the\nCourt of Appeals did not consider\u2014suggests a much broader scope.Ibid.The Government similarly errs by focusing only\non the adjectives \u201ccongressional, administrative, or\n[GAO],\u201d[Footnote 5] which\nprecede \u201creport.\u201d Brief for United States asAmicus Curiae18. It contends that these adjectives suggest that the public\ndisclosure bar applies only to agency reports \u201canalogous to those\nthat Congress and the GAO would issue or conduct.\u201dIbid.As we explained inGraham County, however, those three\nadjectives tell us nothing more than that a \u201creport\u201d must be\ngovernmental. See 559 U. S.,at ___, n.\u00a07 (slip op.,\nat 7, n.\u00a07). The governmental nature of the FOIA responses at\nissue is not disputed.Finally, applying the ordinary meaning of\n\u201creport\u201d does not render superfluous the other sources of public\ndisclosure in \u00a73730(e)(4)(A). Kirk argues that reading \u201creport\u201d to\nmean \u201csomething that gives information\u201d would subsume the other\nwords in the phrase \u201creport, hearing, audit, or investigation.\u201d\nBrief for Respondent 23. But Kirk admits that hearings, audits, and\ninvestigations are processes \u201ctoobtaininformation.\u201dIbid.(emphasis added). Those processes are thus clearly\ndifferent from \u201csomething thatgivesinformation.\u201d\nMoreover, the statute contemplates some redundancy: An \u201caudit,\u201d for\nexample, will often be a type of \u201cinvestigation.\u201dWe are not persuaded that we should adopt a\n\u201cdifferent, somewhat special meaning\u201d of \u201creport\u201d over the word\u2019s\n\u201cprimary meaning.\u201dMuscarellov.United States,524 U. S. 125,\n130, 128 (1998). Indeed, we have cautioned recently against\ninterpreting the public disclosure bar in a way inconsistent with a\nplain reading of its text. InGraham County, we rejected\nseveral arguments for construing the statute narrowly, twice\nemphasizing that the sole \u201ctouchstone\u201d in the statutory text is\n\u201cpublic disclosure.\u201d 559 U. S.,at ___, ___ (slip op., at\n11, 19). We chose in that case simply to give the text its \u201cmost\nnatura[l] read[ing],\u201did.,at ___ (slip op., at 5), and we\ndo so again here.BA written agency response to a\nFOIA request falls within the ordinary meaning of \u201creport.\u201d FOIA\nrequires each agency receiving a request to \u201cnotify the person\nmaking such request of [its] determination and the reasons\ntherefor.\u201d 5 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7552(a)(6)(A)(i). When an agency denies\na request in whole or in part, it must additionally \u201cset forth the\nnames and titles or positions of each person responsible for the\ndenial,\u201d \u201cmake a reasonable effort to estimate the volume of any\n[denied] matter,\u201d and \u201cprovide any such estimate to the person\nmaking the request.\u201d \u00a7\u00a7552(a)(6)(C)(i), (F). The DOL has adopted\nmore detailed regulations implementing FOIA and mandating a\nresponse in writing. See 29 CFR \u00a770.21(a) (2009) (requiring written\nnotice of the grant of a FOIA request and a description of the\nmanner in which records will be disclosed); \u00a7\u00a770.21(b)\u2013(c)\n(requiring a \u201cbrief statement of the reason or reasons for [a]\ndenial,\u201d as well as written notification if a record \u201ccannot be\nlocated or has been destroyed\u201d (italics deleted)). So, too, have\nother federal agencies. See,e.g.,28 CFR \u00a716.6 (2010)\n(Dept. of Justice); 43 CFR \u00a72.21 (2009) (Dept. of Interior); 7 CFR\n\u00a71.7 (2010) (Dept. of Agriculture). Such an agency response plainly\nis \u201csomething that gives information,\u201d a \u201cnotification,\u201d and an\n\u201cofficial or formal statement of facts.\u201dAny records the agency produces\nalong with its written FOIA response are part of that response,\n\u201cjust as if they had been reproduced as an appendix to a printed\nreport.\u201dMistick, 186 F.\u00a03d, at 384, n.\u00a05.\nNothing in the public disclosure bar suggests that a document and\nits attachments must be disaggregated and evaluated individually.\nIf an allegation or transaction is disclosed in a record attached\nto a FOIA response, it is disclosed \u201cin\u201d that FOIA response and,\ntherefore, disclosed \u201cin\u201d a report for the purposes of the public\ndisclosure bar.[Footnote 6]The DOL\u2019s three written FOIA responses to Mrs.\nKirk, along with their attached records, are thus reports within\nthe meaning of the public disclosure bar. Each response was an\n\u201cofficial or formal statement\u201d that \u201c[gave] information\u201d and\n\u201cnotif[ied]\u201d Mrs. Kirk of the agency\u2019s resolution of her FOIA\nrequest.IIIAIn interpreting a statute, \u201c[o]ur\ninquiry must cease if the statutory language is unambiguous,\u201d as we\nhave found, and \u201c\u00a0\u2018the statutory scheme is coherent and\nconsistent.\u2019\u00a0\u201dRobinsonv.Shell Oil Co.,519 U. S. 337,\n340 (1997) (quotingUnited Statesv.Ron Pair\nEnterprises, Inc.,489 U. S. 235, 240\n(1989)). We are not persuaded by assertions that it would be\nanomalous to read the public disclosure bar to encompass written\nFOIA responses.1The drafting history of the\npublic disclosure bar does not contradict our holding. As\noriginally enacted in 1863, the FCA placed no restriction on the\nsources from which aqui tamrelator could acquire\ninformation on which to base a lawsuit. SeeGraham County,\n559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12). Accordingly, this Court upheld\nthe recovery of a relator, even though the Government claimed that\nhe had discovered the basis for his lawsuit by reading a federal\ncriminal indictment. SeeUnited States ex rel. Marcusv.Hess,317\nU. S. 537(1943). In response, Congress amended the statute to\npreclude such \u201cparasitic\u201dqui tamactions based on\n\u201cevidence or information in the possession of the United States \u2026\nat the time such suit was brought.\u201d 559 U. S.,at ___\n(slip op., at 12\u201313) (internal quotation marks omitted). Then, in\n1986, Congress replaced the so-called Government knowledge bar with\nthe narrower public disclosure bar.Id.,at ___ (slip op.,\nat 13).The Court of Appeals concluded\nthat it would be inconsistent with this drafting history to hold\nthat written FOIA responses are reports. The court reasoned that\ndoing so would \u201cessentially resurrect, in a significant subset of\ncases, the government possession standard \u2026 repudiated in 1986.\u201d\n601 F.\u00a03d, at 109.We disagree with the Court of Appeals\u2019\nconclusion. As a threshold matter, \u201cthe drafting history of the\npublic disclosure bar raises more questions than it answers.\u201dGraham County,supra,at ___ (slip op., at 14).\nIn any event, it is hardly inconsistent with the drafting history\nto read the public disclosure bar as operating similarly to the\nGovernment knowledge bar in a \u201csubset of cases.\u201d 601 F.\u00a03d, at\n109. As we have observed, \u201c[r]ather than simply repeal the\nGovernment knowledge bar,\u201d the public disclosure bar was \u201can effort\nto strikea balancebetween encouraging private persons to\nroot out fraud and stifling parasitic lawsuits.\u201d 559 U.\nS.,at ___ (slip op., at 13) (emphasis added).If anything, the drafting history supports our\nholding. The sort of case that Kirk has brought seems to us a\nclassic example of the \u201copportunistic\u201d litigation that the public\ndisclosure bar is designed to discourage.Ibid.(internal\nquotation marks omitted). Although Kirk alleges that he became\nsuspicious from his own experiences as a veteran working at\nSchindler, anyone could have filed the same FOIA requests and then\nfiled the same suit. Similarly, anyone could identify a few\nregulatory filing and certification requirements, submit FOIA\nrequests until he discovers a federal contractor who is out of\ncompliance, and potentially reap a windfall in aqui tamaction under the FCA. See Brief for Chamber of Commerce of the\nUnited States of America et\u00a0al. asAmici Curiae20\n(\u201cGovernment contractors \u2026 are required to submit certifications\nrelated to everything from how they dispose of hazardous materials\nto their affirmative action plans\u201d (citing 40 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a73142\nand 29 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7793)).[Footnote 7]2Nor will extending the public\ndisclosure bar to written FOIA responses necessarily lead to\nunusual consequences. FOIA requires agencies to release some\nrecords even absent a request. See 5 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a7552(a)(1),\n(2). Kirk argues that it would be strange that two relators could\nobtain copies of the same document but that only the relator who\ngot the document in response to a FOIA request would find his case\nbarred.This argument assumes that\nrecords released under FOIA, but not attached to a written FOIA\nresponse, do not fall within the public disclosure bar. We do not\ndecide that question. But even assuming, as Kirk does, that such\nrecords are not covered by the public disclosure bar, we are not\ntroubled by the different treatment. By its plain terms, the public\ndisclosure bar applies to some meth- ods of public disclosure and\nnot to others. SeeGraham County,supra,at ___\n(slip op., at 4) (\u201c[T]he FCA\u2019s public disclosure bar \u2026 deprives\ncourts of jurisdiction overqui tamsuits when the\nrelevant information has already entered the public domain throughcertain channels\u201d (emphasis added)). It would not be\nanomalous if some methods of FOIA disclosure fell within the scope\nof the public disclosure bar and some did not.We also are not concerned that potential\ndefendants will now insulate themselves from liability by making a\nFOIA request for incriminating documents. This argument assumes\nthat the public disclosure of information in a written FOIA\nresponse forever taints that information for purposes of the public\ndisclosure bar. But it may be that a relator who comes by that\ninformation from a different source has a legitimate argument that\nhis lawsuit is not \u201cbased upon\u201d the initial public disclosure. 31\nU. S.\u00a0C. \u00a73730(e)(4)(A). That question has divided the Courts\nof Appeals, and we do not resolve it here. SeeGlaserv.Wound Care Consultants, Inc., 570 F.\u00a03d 907, 915 (CA7\n2009) (describing the split in authority). It may also be that such\na relator qualifies for the \u201coriginal source\u201d exception.[Footnote 8]In any event, the notion that potential\ndefendants will make FOIA requests to insulate themselves from\nliability is pure speculation. Cf.Graham County, 559 U.\nS., at ___ (slip op., at 19) (rejecting as \u201cstrained speculation\u201d\nan argument that local governments will manipulate the public\ndisclosure bar to escape liability). There is no suggestion that\nthis has occurred in those Circuits that have long held that FOIA\nresponses are \u201creports\u201d within the meaning of the public disclosure\nbar.BEven if we accepted these\nextratextual arguments, Kirk and hisamicihave provided\nno principled way to define \u201creport\u201d to exclude FOIA responses\nwithout excluding other documents that are indisputably reports.\nThe Government, for example, struggled to settle on a single\ndefinition. Compare Brief for United States asAmicus\nCuriae19 (\u201creport\u201d must be read to \u201creflect a focus on\nsituations in which the government is conducting, or has completed,\nsome focused inquiry or analysis concerning the relevant facts\u201d)\nwithid.,at 21 (\u201cA FOIA response is not a \u2018report\u2019 \u2026\nbecause the federal agency is not charged with uncovering the truth\nof any matter\u201d), and Tr. of Oral Arg. 33 (\u201c[T]he way to think about\nit is whether or not the agency \u2026 is engaging in a substantive\ninquiry into and a substantive analysis of information\u201d). It is\ndifficult to see how the Department of Justice\u2019s \u201cAnnual Report\u201d of\nFOIA statistics\u2014something that is indisputably a Government\nreport\u2014would qualify under the latter two definitions. See Dept. of\nJustice, Freedom of Information Act An- nual Report, Fiscal Year\n2010, http://www.justice.gov/oip/ annual_report/2010/cover.htm (as\nvisited May 12, 2011, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file);\nsee also Tr. of Oral Arg. 19 (Kirk conceding that the DOJ annual\nreport is a report). And even if the first definition arguably\nencompasses that report, it would seem also to include FOIA\nresponses, which convey the results of a Government agency\u2019s\n\u201cfocused inquiry.\u201dKirk also was unable to\narticulate a workable definition. His various proposed definitions\nsuffer the same deficiencies as the Government\u2019s. Compare Brief for\nRespondent 27 and Tr. of Oral Arg. 17\u201318 with Brief for Respondent\n34\u201339 and Tr. of Oral Arg. 23. Kirk\u2019s first suggestion would\nexclude \u201ca lot of things that are labeled \u2026 report,\u201did.,at 22, and the second\u2014the definition advanced by the Court of\nAppeals\u2014would seem to include written FOIA responses,id.,\nat 28\u201329. In the end, it appears that the \u201conly argument is that\nFOIA is a different kind of mission\u201d\u2014\u201ca special case.\u201dId.,at 31.We see no basis for that distinction\nand adhere to the principle that undefined statutory terms carry\ntheir ordinary meaning.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*The DOL\u2019s three written FOIA\nresponses in this case, along with the accompanying records\nproduced to Mrs. Kirk, are reports within the meaning of the public\ndis-closure bar. Whether Kirk\u2019s suit is \u201cbased upon \u2026 allegations\nor transactions\u201d disclosed in those reports is a question for the\nCourt of Appeals to resolve on remand. The judgment of the United\nStates Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit is reversed, and the\ncase is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this\nopinion.It is so ordered.Justice Kagan took no part in the\nconsideration or decision of this case.Footnote 1During the pendency of this case, the Patient\nProtection and Affordable Care Act, 124 Stat. 119, amended the\npublic disclosure bar. Because the amendments are not applicable to\npending cases,Graham County Soil and Water Conservation\nDist.v.United States ex rel. Wilson, 559 U. S. ___,\n___, n.\u00a01 (2010) (slip op., at 1, n.\u00a01), this opinion\nrefers to the statute as it existed when the suit was filed.Footnote 2The facts in this Part, which we must accept\nas true, are taken from the amended complaint and the filings\nsubmitted in opposition to Schindler\u2019s motion to dismiss.Footnote 3Kirk filed a complaint with the Department of\nLabor\u2019s Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP),\nclaiming that he had been \u201cimproperly demoted and constructively\nterminated by Schindler despite his status as a Vietnam era\nveteran.\u201d App. 23a. The OFCCP investigated Schindler\u2019s compliance\nwith VEVRAA and found insufficient evidence to support Kirk\u2019s\nclaim. In November 2009, the Department of Labor affirmed the\nOFCCP\u2019s finding. 601 F.\u00a03d 94, 99 (CA2 2010).Footnote 4Because we conclude that a written response\nto a FOIA request qualifies as a \u201creport\u201d within the meaning of the\npublic disclosure bar, we need not address whether an agency\u2019s\nsearch in response to a FOIA request also qualifies as an\n\u201cinvestigation.\u201dFootnote 5Although the statute refers to the\n\u201cGovernment Accounting Office,\u201d it is undisputed that Congress\nmeant the General Accounting Office, also known as GAO and now\nrenamed the Government Accountability Office. SeeGraham\nCounty, 559 U. S., at ___, n.\u00a06 (slip op., at 6,\nn.\u00a06).Footnote 6It is irrelevant whether a particular record\nis itself a report. The attached records do not \u201cbecom[e]\u201d reports,\n601 F.\u00a03d, at 109, but simply are part of a report.Footnote 7There is no merit to the suggestion that the\npublic disclosure bar is intended only to excludequi tamsuits that \u201cride the investigatory coattails of the government\u2019s\nown processes.\u201d Brief for Taxpayers Against Fraud Education Fund asAmicus Curiae25, 26; seeGraham County,559 U.\nS., at ___ (slip op., at 19) (rejecting the argument that the\npublic disclosure bar applies only to allegations or transactions\nthat \u201chave landed on the desk of a DOJ lawyer\u201d).Footnote 8An \u201coriginal source\u201d is \u201can individual who\nhas direct and independent knowledge of the information on which\nthe allegations are based and has voluntarily provided the\ninformation to the Government before filing an action under this\nsection which is based on the information.\u201d \u00a73730(e)(4)(B). Some\nCourts of Appeals have narrowly construed the exception to limit\n\u201coriginal sources\u201d to those who were the cause of the public\ndisclosure, while others have been more generous. SeeUnited\nStates ex rel. Duxburyv.Ortho Biotech Prods., L.\nP., 579 F.\u00a03d 13, 22 (CA1 2009) (describing a three-way\nsplit among the Courts of Appeals). That question is not before us,\nand we do not decide it.",
