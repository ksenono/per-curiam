LEE, UNDER SECRETARY OF COM-MERCE FOR\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND DIR-ECTOR, PATENT AND TRADEMARK\nOFFICEon writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the federal circuit[June 20, 2016]Justice Thomas, concurring.The Court invokesChevron U.\u00a0S.\u00a0A.\nInc.v.Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467\nU.\u00a0S. 837 (1984) , andUnited Statesv.Mead\nCorp., 533 U.\u00a0S. 218 (2001) , to resolve one of the\nquestions presented in this case. Seeante,at 2, 13\u201320. But\ntoday\u2019s decision does not rest onChevron\u2019s fiction that\nambiguity in a statutory term is best construed as an implicit\ndelegation of power to an administrative agency to determine the\nbounds of the law. In an appropriate case, this Court should\nreconsider that fiction ofChevronand its progeny. SeeMichiganv.EPA, 576 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2015)\n(Thomas, J., concurring) (slip op., at 2) (\u201cChevrondeference raises serious separation-of-powers questions\u201d); see alsoDepartment of Transportationv.Association of American\nRailroads, 575 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2015) (Thomas, J.,\nconcurring in judgment) (slip op., at 4) (\u201c[T]he discretion\ninherent in executive power doesnotcomprehend the\ndiscretion to formulate generally applicable rules of private\nconduct\u201d);Perezv.Mortgage Bankers Assn., 575\nU.\u00a0S. ___, ___\u2013___ (2015) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment)\n(slip op., at 8\u20139) (\u201cThose who ratified the Constitution knew that\nlegal texts would often contain ambiguities.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\nThe judicial power was understood to include the power to resolve\nthese ambiguities over time\u201d); Cass, IsChevron\u2019s Game Worth\nthe Candle? Burning Interpretation at Both Ends, in Liberty\u2019s\nNemesis 57\u201369 (D. Reuter & J. Yoo eds. 2016).The Court avoids those constitutional concerns\ntoday because the provision of the America Invents Act at issue\ncontains an express and clear conferral of authority to the Patent\nOffice to promulgate rules governing its own proceedings. See 35\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7316(a)(4);ante,at 13. And by asking\nwhether the Patent Office\u2019s preferred rule is reasonable,ante,at 17\u201320, the Court effectively asks whether the\nrulemaking was \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or\notherwise not in accordance with law,\u201d in conformity with the\nAdministrative Procedure Act, 5 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7706(2)(A). I\ntherefore join the Court\u2019s opinion in full.",
