But when does information provided\nto a federal agency qualify as \u201cconfidential\u201d? The Food Marketing\nInstitute says it\u2019s enough if the owner keeps the information\nprivate rather than releasing it publicly. The government suggests\nthat an agency\u2019s promise to keep information from disclosure may\nalso suffice to render it confidential. But the courts below\nimposed a different requirement yet, holding that information can\nnever be deemed confidential unless disclosing it is likely to\nresult in \u201csubstantial competitive harm\u201d to the business that\nprovided it. Finding at least this \u201ccompetitive harm\u201d requirement\ninconsistent with the terms of the statute, we reverse.IThis case began when Argus Leader, a South\nDakota newspaper, filed a FOIA request for data collected by the\nUnited States Department of Agriculture. The USDA administers the\nnational food-stamp program, known as the Supplemental Nutrition\nAssistance Program. Argus Leader asked the USDA for the names and\naddresses of all retail stores that participate in SNAP and each\nstore\u2019s annual SNAP redemption data from fiscal years 2005 to 2010,\nwhich we refer to as \u201cstore-level SNAP data.\u201d The USDA tried to\nmeet the paper halfway. It released the names and addresses of the\nparticipating stores but declined to disclose the requested\nstore-level SNAP data. As relevant here, the USDA invoked FOIA\u2019s\nExemption 4, which shields from disclosure \u201ctrade secrets and\ncommercial or financial information obtained from a person and\nprivileged or confidential.\u201d 5 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7552(b)(4).Unsatisfied by the agency\u2019s disclosure, Argus\nsued the USDA in federal court to compel release of the store-level\nSNAP data. Like several other courts of appeals, the Eighth Circuit\nhas engrafted onto Exemption 4 a so-called \u201ccompetitive harm\u201d test,\nunder which commercial information cannot be deemed \u201cconfidential\u201d\nunless disclosure is \u201clikely .\u00a0.\u00a0. to cause substantial\nharm to the competitive position of the person from whom the\ninformation was obtained.\u201dArgus Leader Mediav.United\nStates Dept. of Agriculture, 889 F.3d 914, 915 (2018) (internal\nquotation marks omitted). So the district court held a two-day\nbench trial to determine whether disclosure of the store-level SNAP\ndata would cause substantial competitive harm to participating\nretailers.At trial, witnesses for the USDA testified that\nretailers closely guard store-level SNAP data and that disclosure\nwould threaten stores\u2019 competitive positions. They explained that\nretailers use models of consumer behavior to help choose new store\nlocations and to plan sales strategies. Competitors\u2019 estimated\nsales volumes represent an important component of these models and\ncan be time consuming and expensive to generate. And a model\u2019s\naccuracy and utility increase significantly if it includes a\nrival\u2019s actual sales data rather than mere estimates. So disclosure\nof store-level SNAP data could create a windfall for competitors:\nStores with high SNAP redemptions could see increased competition\nfor SNAP customers from existing competitors, new market entrants\ncould use SNAP data to determine where to build their stores, and\nSNAP-redemption data could be used to discern a rival retailer\u2019s\noverall sales and develop strategies to win some of that business\ntoo. For its part, Argus Leader offered no fact witnesses and did\nnot dispute that retailers customarily keep this data private or\nthat it bears competitive significance. Instead, the company\ncontended that any competitive harm associated with disclosure\nwould not be substantial. In the end, the district court agreed;\nwhile \u201c[c]ompetition in the grocery business is fierce,\u201d and while\nthe record supported the conclusion that revealing store-level SNAP\ndata could work some competitive harm, the court could not say that\ndisclosure would rise to the level of causing \u201csubstantialcompetitive harm,\u201d and thus ordered disclosure.Argus Leader\nMediav.United States Dept. of Agriculture, 224\nF.\u00a0Supp. 3d 827, 833\u2013835 (SD 2016) (emphasis added).The USDA declined to appeal, but it alerted the\nretailers who had provided the data so that they could consider\nintervening to pursue the case further. The Food Marketing\nInstitute, a trade association representing grocery retailers,\nanswered the call. It successfully moved to intervene under Federal\nRule of Civil Procedure 24(a) and then filed its own appeal.\nMeanwhile, the USDA assured the district court that it would not\ndisclose the retailers\u2019 data pending appeal. Before the Eighth\nCircuit, the Institute argued that the court should discard the\n\u201csubstantial competitive harm\u201d test and apply instead the ordinary\npublic meaning of the statutory term \u201cconfidential.\u201d The court\nrejected that argument and affirmed. We granted the Institute a\nstay of the Eighth Circuit\u2019s mandate and, later, its petition for\ncertiorari. 585 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2018); 586 U.\u00a0S. ___\n(2019).IIBefore turning to the merits, we confront a\nthreshold challenge to our jurisdiction: Argus Leader questions\nwhether the Institute has standing to pursue this appeal. To show\nstanding under Article III, an appealing litigant must demonstrate\nthat it has suffered an actual or imminent injury that is \u201cfairly\ntraceable\u201d to the judgment below and that could be \u201credress[ed] by\na favorable ruling.\u201dMonsanto Co.v.Geertson Seed\nFarms,561 U.S.\n139, 149\u2013150 (2010).The Institute satisfies each of these criteria.\nWhether or not disclosure of the contested data would cause its\nmember retailers \u201csubstantial competitive harm,\u201d the record before\nus reveals (and Argus Leader does not meaningfully dispute) that\ndisclosure likely would cause themsomefinancial injury. As\nthe Eighth Circuit observed, the grocery industry is \u201chighly\ncompetitive,\u201d and disclosure of store-level SNAP data likely would\nhelp competitors win business from the Institute\u2019s members. 889\nF.\u00a03d, at 916. This concrete injury is, as well, directly\ntraceable to the judgment ordering disclosure. And a favorable\nruling from this Court would redress the retailers\u2019 injury by\nreversing that judgment.Argus Leader insists that the Institute\u2019s injury\nis not redressable because a favorable ruling would merely restore\nthe government\u2019sdiscretionto withhold the requested data\nunder Exemption 4, and it might just as easily choose to provide\nthe data anyway. But the government has represented unequivocally\nthat, consistent with its longstanding policy and past assurances\nof confidentiality to retailers, it \u201cwill not disclose\u201d the\ncontested data unless compelled to do so by the district court\u2019s\norder. Brief for United States asAmicus Curiae35; accord,\nTr. of Oral Arg. 18\u201322. A reversal here thus would ensure exactly\nthe relief the Institute requests. That is enough to satisfy\nArticle III.Monsanto, 561 U.\u00a0S., at 152\u2013153.IIIAAs we\u2019ve seen, Exemption 4 shields from\nmandatory disclosure \u201ccommercial or financial information obtained\nfrom a person and privileged or confidential.\u201d 5 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7552(b)(4). But FOIA nowhere defines the term \u201cconfidential.\u201d So,\nas usual, we ask what that term\u2019s \u201cordinary, contemporary, common\nmeaning\u201d was when Congress enacted FOIA in 1966.Perrinv.United States,444 U.S.\n37, 42 (1979). We\u2019ve done the same with other undefined terms\nin FOIA. See,e.g.,Milnerv.Department of\nNavy,562 U.S.\n562, 569 (2011);United Statesv.Weber Aircraft\nCorp.,465 U.S.\n792, 804 (1984).The term \u201cconfidential\u201d meant then, as it does\nnow, \u201cprivate\u201d or \u201csecret.\u201d Webster\u2019s Seventh New Collegiate\nDictionary 174 (1963). Contemporary dictionaries suggest two\nconditions that might be required for information communicated to\nanother to be considered confidential. In one sense, information\ncommunicated to another remains confidential whenever it is\ncustomarily kept private, or at least closely held, by the person\nimparting it. See,e.g., Webster\u2019s Third New International\nDictionary 476 (1961) (\u201cknown only to a limited few\u201d or \u201cnot\npublicly disseminated\u201d); Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 370 (rev. 4th ed.\n1968) (\u201cintended to be held in confidence or kept secret\u201d). In\nanother sense, information might be considered confidential only if\nthe party receiving it provides some assurance that it will remain\nsecret. See,e.g., 1 Oxford Universal Dictionary Illustrated\n367 (3d ed. 1961) (\u201cspoken or written in confidence\u201d); Webster\u2019s\nNew World Dictionary 158 (1960) (\u201ctold in confidence\u201d).Must both of these conditions be met for\ninformation to be considered confidential under Exemption 4? At\nleast the first condition has to be; it is hard to see how\ninformation could be deemed confidential if its owner shares it\nfreely. And there\u2019s no question that the Institute\u2019s members\nsatisfy this condition; uncontested testimony established that the\nInstitute\u2019s retailers customarily do not disclose store-level SNAP\ndata or make it publicly available \u201cin any way.\u201d See,e.g.,App. 93\u201394. Even within a company, witnesses testified, only small\ngroups of employees usually have access to it. But what about the\nsecond condition: Can privately held informationloseits\nconfidential character for purposes of Exemption 4 if it\u2019s\ncommunicated to the government without assurances that the\ngovernment will keep it private? As it turns out, there\u2019s no need\nto resolve that question in this case because the retailers before\nus clearly satisfy this condition too. Presumably to induce\nretailers to participate in SNAP and provide store-level\ninformation it finds useful to its adminstration of the program,\nthe government has long promised them that it will keep their\ninformation private. See,e.g., 43 Fed. Reg. 43275 (1978);\nsee also Brief for United States asAmicus Curiae27\u201330.Early courts of appeals confronting Exemption 4\ninterpreted its terms in ways consistent with these understandings.\nInGSAv.Benson, 415 F.2d 878, 881 (1969), for\nexample, the Ninth Circuit concluded that Exemption 4 would\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018protect information that a private individual wishes to\nkeep confidential for his own purposes, but reveals to the\ngovernment under the express or implied promise\u2019\u00a0\u201d of\nconfidentiality. The D.\u00a0C. Circuit similarly held that\nExemption 4 covered sales documents \u201c\u00a0\u2018which would customarily\nnot be released to the public\u2019\u00a0\u201d and which the government\n\u201cagreed to treat .\u00a0.\u00a0. as confidential.\u201dSterling Drug\nInc.v.FTC, 450 F.2d 698, 709 (1971); see alsoGrumman Aircraft Eng. Corp.v.Renegotiation Bd., 425\nF.2d 578, 580, 582 (1970) (information a private party \u201csubmitted\n\u2018in confidence\u2019\u00a0\u201d or \u201cwould not reveal to the public [is]\nexempt from disclosure\u201d).BNotably lacking from dictionary definitions,\nearly case law, or any other usual source that might shed light on\nthe statute\u2019s ordinary meaning is any mention of the \u201csubstantial\ncompetive harm\u201d requirement that the courts below found unsatisfied\nand on which Argus Leader pins its hopes. Indeed, when called on\nsome years ago to interpret the similar phrase \u201cinformation\nfurnished by a confidential source\u201d in FOIA Exemption 7(D),\n\u00a7552(b)(7)(D), this Court looked, as we do now, to \u201ccommon usage\u201d\nand never suggested that the government must prove that the\ndisclosure of a source\u2019s information would result in substantial\nharm.Department of Justicev.Landano,508 U.S.\n165, 173\u2013174 (1993).So wheredidthe \u201csubstantial competitive\nharm\u201d requirement come from? In 1974, the D.\u00a0C. Circuit\ndeclared that, in addition to the requirements actually set forth\nin Exemption 4, a \u201ccourt must also be satisfied that non-disclosure\nis justified by the legislative purpose which underlies the\nexemption.\u201dNational Parks & Conservation Assn.v.Morton, 498 F.2d 765, 767. Then, after a selective tour\nthrough the legislative history, the court concluded that\n\u201ccommercial or financial matter is \u2018confidential\u2019 [only] if\ndisclosure of the information is likely .\u00a0.\u00a0. (1) to\nimpair the Government\u2019s ability to obtain necessary information in\nthe future; or (2) to cause substantial harm to the competitive\nposition of the person from whom the information was obtained.\u201dId., at 770. Without much independent analysis, a number of\ncourts of appeals eventually fell in line and adopted variants of\ntheNational Parkstest. SeeContract Freighters,\nInc.v.Secretary of U. S. Dept. of Transp.,260 F.3d 858, 861 (CA8 2001) (collecting cases).We cannot approve such a casual disregard of the\nrules of statutory interpretation. In statutory interpretation\ndisputes, a court\u2019s proper starting point lies in a careful\nexamination of the ordinary meaning and structure of the law\nitself.Schindler Elevator Corp.v.United States ex rel.\nKirk,563 U.S.\n401, 407 (2011). Where, as here, that examination yields a\nclear answer, judges must stop.Hughes Aircraft Co.v.Jacobson,525 U.S.\n432, 438 (1999).Even those of us who sometimes consult\nlegislative history will never allow it to be used to \u201cmuddy\u201d the\nmeaning of \u201cclear statutory language.\u201dMilner, 562\nU.\u00a0S., at 572. Indeed, this Court has repeatedly refused to\nalter FOIA\u2019s plain terms on the strength only of arguments from\nlegislative history. See,e.g., Landano, 508 U.\u00a0S., at\n178 (refusing to expand the plain meaning of Exemption 7(D) based\non legislative history);Weber Aircraft, 465 U.\u00a0S., at\n800\u2013803 (refusing to restrict Exemption 5 based on legislative\nhistory).National Parks\u2019 contrary approach is a\nrelic from a \u201cbygone era of statutory construction.\u201d Brief for\nUnited States asAmicus Curiae19. Not only didNational\nParksinappropriately resort to legislative history before\nconsulting the statute\u2019s text and structure, once it did so it went\neven further astray. The court relied heavily on statements from\nwitnesses in congressional hearings years earlier on a different\nbill that was never enacted into law. 498 F.\u00a02d, at 767\u2013769.\nYet we can all agree that \u201cexcerpts from committee hearings\u201d are\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018among the least illuminating forms of legislative\nhistory.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAdvocate Health Care Networkv.Stapleton, 581 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 12);\nsee alsoKellyv.Robinson,479 U.S.\n36, 51, n.\u00a013 (1986) (declining to \u201caccord any\nsignificance\u201d to \u201ccomments in [legislative] hearings\u201d). Perhaps\nespecially so in cases like this one, where the witness statements\ndo not comport with official committee reports that are consistent\nwith the plain and ordinary meaning of the statute\u2019s terms. See\nS.\u00a0Rep. No. 813, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., 9 (1965) (Exemption 4\nprotects information \u201cwhich would customarily not be released to\nthe public by the person from whom it was obtained\u201d such as\n\u201cbusiness sales statistics\u201d and \u201ccustomer lists\u201d); H.\u00a0R. Rep.\nNo. 1497, 89th Cong., 2d Sess., 10 (1966) (Exemption 4 exempts\nmaterial \u201cif it would not customarily be made public by the person\nfrom whom it was obtained by the Government\u201d and \u201cinformation which\nis given to an agency in confidence\u201d such as \u201cbusiness sales\nstatistics\u201d).Unsurprisingly,National Parkshas drawn\nconsiderable criticism over the years. See,e.g.,Critical Mass Energy Projectv.NRC, 931 F.2d 939,\n947 (CADC 1991) (Randolph, J., concurring) (National Parkswas \u201c\u00a0\u2018fabricated .\u00a0.\u00a0. out of whole cloth\u2019\u00a0\u201d);New Hampshire Right to Lifev.Department of Health and\nHuman Servs., 577 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2015) (Thomas, J., joined by\nScalia, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari). Even the\nD.\u00a0C. Circuit has distanced itself from the decision. While\nretainingNational Parksprincipally as a matter ofstare\ndecisisin the context of information a private entity isrequiredto provide to the government, the court has\npointedly declined to extend theNational Parkstest to\ninformation providedvoluntarilyto the government under\nExemption 4. There, the court has adhered to a much more\ntraditional understanding of the statutory term \u201cconfidential,\u201d\nholding that information qualifies as confidential \u201cif it is of a\nkind that would customarily not be released to the public by the\nperson from whom it was obtained.\u201dCritical Mass Energy\nProjectv.NRC, 975 F.2d 871, 879\u2013880 (CADC 1992) (en\nbanc); see alsoid.,at 880\u2013882 (Randolph, J., concurring).\nNor, unbound by D.\u00a0C. Circuit precedent, can we discern a\npersuasive reason to afford thesamestatutory term two such\nradically different constructions.Ratzlafv.United\nStates,510 U.S.\n135, 143 (1994).CThat leaves Argus Leader to try to salvage the\nresult, if not the reasoning, ofNational Parks. But here\nits arguments prove no more persuasive. The company begins by\nrearranging the text of Exemption 4 to create a phrase that does\nnot appear in the statute: \u201cconfidential commercial information.\u201d\nThen, it suggests this synthetic term mirrors a preexisting common\nlaw term of art. And finally it asserts that the common law term\ncovers only information whose release would lead to substantial\ncompetitive harm. But Argus Leader points to no treatise or case\ndecided before Exemption 4\u2019s adoption that assigned any such\nmeaning to the terms actually before us: \u201ccommercial or financial\ninformation [that is] privileged or confidential.\u201d So even\naccepting (without granting) thatotherphrases may carry\nthe specialized common law meaning Argus Leader supposes, the\nparties have mustered no evidence that the terms of Exemption 4 did\nat the time of their adoption. Nor will this Court ordinarily imbue\nstatutory terms with a specialized common law meaning when Congress\nhasn\u2019t itself invoked the common law terms of art associated with\nthat meaning. See,e.g., Bruesewitzv.Wyeth LLC,562 U.S.\n223, 233\u2013235 (2011).Alternatively, the company suggests that,\nwhatever the merits ofNational Parksas an initial matter,\nCongress effectively ratified its understanding of the term\n\u201cconfidential\u201d by enacting similar phrases in other statutes in the\nyears since that case was decided. To be sure, the ratification\ncanon can sometimes prove a useful interpretive tool. But it\nderives from the notion that Congress is aware of a definitive\njudicial interpretation of a statute when it reenacts thesamestatute using the same language.Helsinn Healthcare\nS.\u00a0A.v.Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc., 586\nU.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2019) (slip op., at 7). And Congress has never\nreenacted Exemption 4. So whether Congress\u2019s use of similar\nlanguage in other statutes afterNational Parksmight (or\nmight not) tell us what later Congresses understood those other\nstatutes to mean, it tells us nothing about Congress\u2019s\nunderstanding of the language it enacted in Exemption 4 in\n1966.Finally, Argus urges us to adopt a \u201csubstantial\ncompetitive harm\u201d requirement as a matter of policy because it\nbelieves FOIA exemptions should be narrowly construed. But as we\nhave explained in connection with another federal statute, we\nnormally \u201chave no license to give [statutory] exemption[s] anything\nbut a fair reading.\u201dEncino Motorcars, LLCv.Navarro, 584 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2018) (slip op., at 9).\nNor do we discern a reason to depart from that rule here: FOIA\nexpressly recognizes that \u201cimportant interests [are] served by\n[its] exemptions,\u201dFBIv.Abramson,456 U.S.\n615, 630\u2013631 (1982), and \u201c[t]hose exemptions are as much a part\nof [FOIA\u2019s] purpose[s and policies] as the [statute\u2019s disclosure]\nrequirement,\u201dEncino Motorcars, 584 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 9). So, just as we cannot properlyexpandExemption\n4 beyond what its terms permit, see,e.g.,Milner,\n562 U.\u00a0S., at 570\u2013571, we cannot arbitrarilyconstrictit either by adding limitations found nowhere in its terms.Our dissenting colleagues appear to endorse\nsomething like this final argument. They seem to agree that the law\ndoesn\u2019t demand proof of \u201csubstantial\u201d or \u201ccompetitive\u201d harm, but\nthey think it would be a good idea to require a showing ofsomeharm. Neither side, however, has advocated for such an\nunderstanding of the statute\u2019s terms. And our colleagues\u2019 brief\nbrush with the statutory text doesn\u2019t help; they cite exclusively\nfrom specialized dictionary definitions lifted from the national\nsecurity classification context that have no bearing on Exemption\n4. Really, our colleagues\u2019 submission boils down to a policy\nargument about the benefits of broad disclosure. But as Justice\nBreyer has noted, when Congress enacted FOIA it sought a \u201cworkable\nbalance\u201d between disclosure and other governmental\ninterests\u2014interests that may include providing private parties with\nsufficient assurances about the treatment of their proprietary\ninformation so they will cooperate in federal programs and supply\nthe government with information vital to its work. SeeMilner, 562 U. S., at 589 (dissenting opinion) (arguing for\na broad exemption from FOIA disclosure obligations to honor a\n\u201cworkable balance\u201d between disclosure and privacy).*At least where commercial or financial\ninformation is both customarily and actually treated as private by\nits owner and provided to the government under an assurance of\nprivacy, the information is \u201cconfidential\u201d within the meaning of\nExemption 4. Because the store-level SNAP data at issue here is\nconfidential under that construction, the judgment of the court of\nappeals is reversed and the case is remanded for further\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.",
