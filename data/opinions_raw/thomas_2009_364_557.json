S. ____ (2009)SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESNO. 08-479SAFFORD UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT #1, et\u00a0al.,\nPETITIONERSv.APRIL REDDINGon writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the ninth circuit[June 25, 2009]Justice Thomas, concurring in the\njudgment in part and dissenting in part.I agree with the Court that the\njudgment against the school officials with respect to qualified\nimmunity should be reversed. Seeante, at 11\u201313. Unlike\nthe majority, however, I would hold that the search of Savana\nRedding did not violate the Fourth Amendment. The majority imposes\na vague and amorphous standard on school administrators. It also\ngrants judges sweeping authority to second-guess the measures that\nthese officials take to maintain discipline in their schools and\nensure the health and safety of the students in their charge. This\ndeep intrusion into the administration of public schools\nexemplifies why the Court should return to the common-law doctrine\nofin loco parentisunder which \u201cthe judiciary was\nreluctant to interfere in the routine business of school\nadministration, allowing schools and teachers to set and enforce\nrules and to maintain order.\u201dMorsev.Frederick,551 U. S. 393,\n414 (2007) (Thomas, J., concurring). But even under the prevailing\nFourth Amendment test established byNew Jerseyv.T.\u00a0L.\u00a0O.,469 U. S. 325(1985), all petitioners,\nincluding the school district, are entitled to judgment as a matter\nof law in their favor.I\u201cAlthough the underlying command\nof the Fourth Amendment is always that searches and seizures be\nreasonable, what is reasonable depends on the context within which\na search takes place.\u201dId., at 337. Thus, although public\nschool students retain Fourth Amendment rights under this Court\u2019s\nprecedent, seeid., at 333\u2013337, those rights \u201care\ndifferent \u2026 than elsewhere; the \u2018reasonableness\u2019 inquiry cannot\ndisregard the schools\u2019 custodial and tutelary responsibility for\nchildren,\u201dVernonia School Dist. 47Jv.Acton,515 U. S. 646,\n656 (1995); see alsoT. L. O., 469 U. S., at 339\n(identifying \u201cthe substantial interest of teachers and\nadministrators in maintaining discipline in the classroom and on\nschool grounds\u201d). For nearly 25 years this Court has understood\nthat \u201c[m]aintaining order in the classroom has never been easy, but\nin more recent years, school disorder has often taken particularly\nugly forms: drug use and violent crime in the schools have become\nmajor social problems.\u201dIbid.In schools, \u201c[e]vents\ncalling for discipline are frequent occurrences and sometimes\nrequire immediate, effective action.\u201dGossv.Lopez,419\nU. S. 565, 580 (1975); see alsoT. L. O.,469 U. S.,\nat 340 (explaining that schools have a \u201clegitimate need to maintain\nan environment in which learning can take place\u201d).For this reason, school officials\nretain broad authority to protect students and preserve \u201corder and\na proper educational environment\u201d under the Fourth Amendment.Id.,at 339. This authority requires that school officials\nbe able to engage in the \u201cclose supervision of schoolchildren, as\nwell as \u2026 enforc[e] rules against conduct that would be perfectly\npermissible if undertaken by an adult.\u201dIbid.Seeking to\nreconcile the Fourth Amendment with this unique public school\nsetting, the Court inT.\u00a0L.\u00a0O.held that a\nschool search is \u201creasonable\u201d if it is \u201c\u00a0\u2018justified at its\ninception\u2019\u00a0\u201d and \u201c\u00a0\u2018reasonably related in scope to the\ncircumstances which justified the interference in the first\nplace.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId., at 341\u2013342 (quotingTerryv.Ohio,392 U.\nS. 1, 20 (1968)). The search under review easily meets this\nstandard.AA \u201csearch of a student by a\nteacher or other school official will be \u2018justified at its\ninception\u2019 when there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that\nthe search will turn up evidence that the student has violated or\nis violating either the law or the rules of the school.\u201dT.\u00a0L.\u00a0O.,supra, at 341\u2013342 (footnote\nomitted). As the majority rightly concedes, this search was\njustified at its inception because there were reasonable grounds to\nsuspect that Redding possessed medication that violated school\nrules. Seeante, at 7. A finding of reasonable suspicion\n\u201cdoes not deal with hard certainties, but with probabilities.\u201dUnited Statesv.Cortez,449 U. S. 411, 418\n(1981); see alsoT.\u00a0L.\u00a0O.,supra, at\n346 (\u201c[T]he requirement of reasonable suspicion is not a\nrequirement of absolute certainty\u201d). To satisfy this standard, more\nthan a mere \u201chunch\u201d of wrongdoing is required, but \u201cconsiderably\u201d\nless suspicion is needed than would be required to \u201csatisf[y] a\npreponderance of the evidence standard.\u201dUnited Statesv.Arvizu,534\nU. S. 266, 274 (2002) (internal quotation marks omitted).Furthermore, in evaluating\nwhether there is a reasonable \u201cparticularized and objective\u201d basis\nfor conducting a search based on suspected wrongdoing, government\nofficials must consider the \u201ctotality of the circumstances.\u201dId., at 273 (internal quotation marks omitted). School\nofficials have a specialized understanding of the school\nenvironment, the habits of the students, and the concerns of the\ncommunity, which enables them to \u201c\u00a0\u2018formulat[e] certain\ncommon-sense conclusions about human behavior.\u2019\u00a0\u201dUnited\nStatesv.Sokolow,490 U. S. 1, 8 (1989)\n(quotingCortez,supra, at 418). And like police\nofficers, school officials are \u201centitled to make an assessment of\nthe situation in light of [this] specialized training and\nfamiliarity with the customs of the [school].\u201d SeeArvizu,supra,at 276.Here, petitioners had reasonable grounds to\nsuspect that Redding was in possession of prescription and\nnonprescription drugs in violation of the school\u2019s prohibition of\nthe \u201cnon-medical use, possession, or sale of a drug\u201d on school\nproperty or at school events. 531 F.\u00a03d 1071, 1076 (CA9 2008)\n(en banc); see alsoid., at 1107 (Hawkins, J., dissenting)\n(explaining that the school policy defined \u201cdrugs\u201d to include\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018[a]ny prescription or over-the-counter drug, except those\nfor which permission to use in school has been granted\u2019\u00a0\u201d). As\nan initial matter, school officials were aware that a few years\nearlier, a student had become \u201cseriously ill\u201d and \u201cspent several\ndays in intensive care\u201d after ingesting prescription medication\nobtained from a classmate. App. 10a. Fourth Amendment searches do\nnot occur in a vacuum; rather, context must inform the judicial\ninquiry. SeeCortez,supra, at 417\u2013418. In this\ninstance, the suspicion of drug possession arose at a middle school\nthat had \u201ca history of problems with students using and\ndistributing prohibited and illegal substances on campus.\u201d App. 7a,\n10a.The school\u2019s substance-abuse problems had not\nabated by the 2003\u20132004 school year, which is when the challenged\nsearch of Redding took place. School officials had found alcohol\nand cigarettes in the girls\u2019 bathroom during the first school dance\nof the year and noticed that a group of students including Redding\nand Marissa Glines smelled of alcohol.Ibid.Several weeks\nlater, another student, Jordan Romero, reported that Redding had\nhosted a party before the dance where she served whiskey, vodka,\nand tequila.Id.,at 8a, 11a. Romero had provided this\nreport to school officials as a result of a meeting his mother\nscheduled with the officials after Romero \u201cbec[a]me violent\u201d and\n\u201csick to his stomach\u201d one night and admitted that \u201che had taken\nsome pills that he had got[ten] from a classmate.\u201dId.,at\n7a\u20138a, 10a\u201311a. At that meeting, Romero admitted that \u201ccertain\nstudents were bringing drugs and weapons on campus.\u201dId.,at 8a, 11a. One week later, Romero handed the assistant principal a\nwhite pill that he said he had received from Glines.Id.,at 11a. He reported \u201cthat a group of students [were] planning on\ntaking the pills at lunch.\u201dIbid.School officials justifiably took quick action\nin light of the lunchtime deadline. The assistant principal took\nthe pill to the school nurse who identified it as\nprescription-strength 400-mg Ibuprofen.Id.,at 12a. A\nsubsequent search of Glines and her belongings produced a razor\nblade, a Naproxen 200-mg pill, and several Ibuprofen 400-mg pills.Id.,at 13a. When asked, Glines claimed that she had\nreceived the pills from Redding.Ibid.A search of\nRedding\u2019s planner, which Glines had borrowed, then uncovered\n\u201cseveral knives, several lighters, a cigarette, and a permanent\nmarker.\u201dId.,at 12a, 14a, 22a. Thus, as the majority\nacknowledges,ante, at 7, the totality of relevant\ncircumstances justified a search of Redding for pills.[Footnote 1]BThe remaining question is whether\nthe search was reasonable in scope. UnderT.\u00a0L.\u00a0O., \u201ca search will be permissible in its\nscope when the measures adopted are reasonably related to the\nobjectives of the search and not excessively intrusive in light of\nthe age and sex of the student and the nature of the infraction.\u201d\n469 U. S., at 342. The majority concludes that the school\nofficials\u2019 search of Redding\u2019s underwear was not \u201c\u00a0\u2018reasonably\nrelated in scope to the circumstances which justified the\ninterference in the first place,\u2019\u00a0\u201d seeante, at\n8\u201311, notwithstanding the officials\u2019 reasonable suspicion that\nRedding \u201cwas involved in pill distribution,\u201dante,at 7.\nAccording to the majority, to be reasonable, this school search\nrequired a showing of \u201cdanger to the students from the power of the\ndrugs or their quantity\u201d or a \u201creason to suppose that [Redding] was\ncarrying pills in her underwear.\u201dAnte, at 10. Each of\nthese additional requirements is an unjustifiable departure from\nbedrock Fourth Amendment law in the school setting, where this\nCourt has heretofore read the Fourth Amendment to grant\nconsiderable leeway to school officials. Because the school\nofficials searched in a location where the pills could have been\nhidden, the search was reasonable in scope underT.\u00a0L.\u00a0O.1The majority finds that\n\u201csubjective and reasonable societal expectations of personal\nprivacy support \u2026 treat[ing]\u201d this type of search, which it labels\na \u201cstrip search,\u201d as \u201ccategorically distinct, requiring distinct\nelements of justification on the part of school authorities for\ngoing beyond a search of clothing and belongings.\u201d Ante, at\n8.[Footnote 2] Thus, in the\nmajority\u2019s view, although the school officials had reasonable\nsuspicion to believe that Redding had the pills on her person, seeante, at 7, they needed some greater level of\nparticularized suspicion to conduct this \u201cstrip search.\u201d There is\nno support for this contortion of the Fourth Amendment.The Court has generally held that\nthe reasonableness of a search\u2019s scope depends only on whether it\nis limited to the area that is capable of concealing the object of\nthe search. See,e.g., Wyomingv.Houghton,526 U. S. 295,\n307 (1999) (Police officers \u201cmay inspect passengers\u2019 belongings\nfound in the car that are capable of concealing the object of the\nsearch\u201d);Floridav.Jimeno,500 U. S. 248, 251\n(1991) (\u201cThe scope of a search is generally defined by its\nexpressed object\u201d);United Statesv.Johns,469 U. S. 478,\n487 (1985) (search reasonable because \u201cthere is no plausible\nargument that the object of the search could not have been\nconcealed in the packages\u201d);United Statesv.Ross,456\nU. S. 798, 820 (1982) (\u201cA lawful search \u2026 generally extends to\nthe entire area in which the object of the search may be\nfound\u201d).[Footnote 3]In keeping with this longstanding rule, the\n\u201cnature of the infraction\u201d referenced inT.\u00a0L.\u00a0O.delineates the proper scope of a search\nof students in a way that is identical to that permitted for\nsearches outside the school\u2014i.e., the search must be\nlimited to the areas where the object of that infraction could be\nconcealed. SeeHortonv.California,496 U. S. 128, 141\n(1990) (\u201cPolice with a warrant for a rifle may search only places\nwhere rifles might be\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted));Ross,supra, at 824 (\u201c[P]robable cause to believe\nthat undocumented aliens are being transported in a van will not\njustify a warrantless search of a suitcase\u201d). A search of a student\ntherefore is permissible in scope underT.\u00a0L.\u00a0O.so long as it is objectively reasonable to believe that the area\nsearched could conceal the contraband. The dissenting opinion below\ncorrectly captured this Fourth Amendment standard, noting that \u201cif\na student brought a baseball bat on campus in violation of school\npolicy, a search of that student\u2019s shirt pocket would be patently\nunjustified.\u201d 531 F.\u00a03d, at 1104 (opinion of Hawkins, J.).The analysis of whether the scope of the\nsearch here was permissible under that standard is straightforward.\nIndeed, the majority does not dispute that \u201cgeneral background\npossibilities\u201d establish that students conceal \u201ccontraband in their\nunderwear.\u201dAnte,at 10. It acknowledges that school\nofficials had reasonable suspicion to look in Redding\u2019s backpack\nand outer clothing because if \u201cWilson\u2019s reasonable suspicion of\npill distribution were not understood to support searches of outer\nclothes and backpack, it would not justify any search worth\nmaking.\u201dAnte, at 7. The majority nevertheless concludes\nthat proceeding any further with the search was unreasonable. Seeante, at 8\u201310; see alsoante, at 1 (Ginsburg, J.,\nconcurring in part and dissenting in part) (\u201cAny reasonable search\nfor the pills would have ended when inspection of Redding\u2019s\nbackpack and jacket pockets yielded nothing\u201d). But there is no\nsupport for this conclusion. The reasonable suspicion that Redding\npossessed the pills for distribution purposes did not dissipate\nsimply because the search of her backpack turned up nothing. It was\neminently reasonable to conclude that the backpack was empty\nbecause Redding was secreting the pills in a place she thought no\none would look. SeeRoss,supra, at 820\n(\u201cContraband goods rarely are strewn\u201d about in plain view; \u201cby\ntheir very nature such goods must be withheld from public\nview\u201d).Redding would not have been the first person\nto conceal pills in her undergarments. See Hicks, Man Gets 17-Year\nDrug Sentence, [Corbin, KY] Times-Tribune, Oct. 7, 2008, p.\u00a01\n(Drug courier \u201ctold officials she had the [Oxycontin] pills\nconcealed in her crotch\u201d); Conley, Whitehaven: Traffic Stop Yields\nHydrocodone Pills, [Memphis] Commercial Appeal, Aug. 3, 2007, p. B3\n(\u201cAn additional 40 hydrocodone pills were found in her pants\u201d);\nCaywood, Police Vehicle Chase Leads to Drug Arrests, [Worcester]\nTelegram & Gazette, June 7, 2008, p. A7 (25-year-old \u201callegedly\nhad a cigar tube stuffed with pills tucked into the waistband of\nhis pants\u201d); Hubartt, 23-Year-Old Charged With Dealing Ecstasy, The\n[Fort Wayne] Journal Gazette, Aug. 8, 2007, p. C2 (\u201c[W]hile he was\nbeing put into a squad car, his pants fell down and a plastic bag\ncontaining pink and orange pills fell on the ground\u201d); Sebastian\nResidents Arrested in Drug Sting, Vero Beach Press Journal, Sept.\n16, 2006, p. B2 (Arrestee \u201ctold them he had more pills \u2018down my\npants\u2019\u00a0\u201d). Nor will she be the last after today\u2019s decision,\nwhich announces the safest place to secrete contraband in\nschool.2The majority compounds its error\nby reading the \u201cnature of the infraction\u201d aspect of theT.\u00a0L.\u00a0O.test as a license to limit searches\nbased on a judge\u2019s assessment of a particular school policy.\nAccording to the majority, the scope of the search was\nimpermissible because the school official \u201cmust have been aware of\nthe nature and limited threat of the specific drugs he was\nsearching for\u201d and because he \u201chad no reason to suspect that large\namounts of the drugs were being passed around, or that individual\nstudents were receiving great numbers of pills.\u201dAnte, at\n9\u201310. Thus, in order to locate a rationale for finding a Fourth\nAmendment violation in this case, the majority retreats from its\nobservation that the school\u2019s firm no-drug policy \u201cmakes sense, and\nthere is no basis to claim that the search was unreasonable owing\nto some defect or shortcoming of the rule it was aimed at\nenforcing.\u201dAnte, at 5, n.\u00a01.Even accepting the majority\u2019s\nassurances that it is not attacking the rule\u2019s reasonableness, it\ncertainly is attacking the rule\u2019s importance. This approach\ndirectly conflicts withT.\u00a0L.\u00a0O.in which the\nCourt was \u201cunwilling to adopt a standard under which the legality\nof a search is dependent upon a judge\u2019s evaluation of the relative\nimportance of school rules.\u201d 469 U. S., at 342, n.\u00a09. Indeed,\nthe Court inT.\u00a0L.\u00a0O.expressly rejected the\nproposition that the majority seemingly endorses\u2014that \u201csome rules\nregarding student conduct are by nature too \u2018trivial\u2019 to justify a\nsearch based upon reasonable suspicion.\u201dIbid.;see alsoid.,at 343, n.\u00a09 (\u201cThe promulgation of a rule\nforbidding specified conduct presumably reflects a judgment on the\npart of school officials that such conduct is destructive of school\norder or of a proper educational environment. Absent any suggestion\nthat the rule violates some substantive constitutional guarantee,\nthe courts should as a general matter, defer to that\njudgment\u201d).The majority\u2019s decision in this regard also\ndeparts from another basic principle of the Fourth Amendment: that\nlaw enforcement officials can enforce with the same vigor all rules\nand regulations irrespective of the perceived importance of any of\nthose rules. \u201cIn a long line of cases, we have said that when an\nofficer has probable cause to believe a person committed even a\nminor crime in his presence, the balancing of private and public\ninterests is not in doubt. The arrest is constitutionally\nreasonable.\u201dVirginiav.Moore, 553 U. S. ___,\n___ (2008) (slip op., at 6). The Fourth Amendment rule for searches\nis the same: Police officers are entitled to search regardless of\nthe perceived triviality of the underlying law. As we have\nexplained, requiring police to make \u201csensitive, case-by-case\ndeterminations of government need,\u201dAtwaterv.Lago\nVista,532 U.\nS. 318, 347 (2001), for a particular prohibition before\nconducting a search would \u201cplace police in an almost impossible\nspot,\u201did., at 350.The majority has placed school officials in\nthis \u201cimpossible spot\u201d by questioning whether possession of\nIbuprofen and Naproxen causes a severe enough threat to warrant\ninvestigation. Had the suspected infraction involved a street drug,\nthe majority implies that it would have approved the scope of the\nsearch. Seeante, at 9 (relying on the \u201climited threat of\nthe specific drugs he was searching for\u201d);ante,at 10\n(relying on the limited \u201cpower of the drugs\u201d involved). In effect,\nthen, the majority has replaced a school rule that draws no\ndistinction among drugs with a new one that does. As a result, a\nfull search of a student\u2019s person for prohibited drugs will be\npermitted only if the Court agrees that the drug in question was\nsufficiently dangerous. Such a test is unworkable and unsound.\nSchool officials cannot be expected to halt searches based on the\npossibility that a court might later find that the particular\ninfraction at issue is not severe enough to warrant an intrusive\ninvestigation.[Footnote 4]A rule promulgated by a school board\nrepresents the judgment of school officials that the rule is needed\nto maintain \u201cschool order\u201d and \u201ca proper educational environment.\u201dT.\u00a0L.\u00a0O., 469 U. S., at 343, n.\u00a09.\nTeachers, administrators, and the local school board are called\nupon both to \u201cprotect the \u2026 safety of students and school\npersonnel\u201d and \u201cmaintain an environment conducive to learning.\u201dId., at 353 (Blackmun, J., concurring in judgment). They\nare tasked with \u201cwatch[ing] over a large number of students\u201d who\n\u201care inclined to test the outer boundaries of acceptable conduct\nand to imitate the misbehavior of a peer if that misbehavior is not\ndealt with quickly.\u201dId., at 352. In such an environment,\nsomething as simple as a \u201cwater pistol or peashooter can wreak\n[havoc] until it is taken away.\u201dIbid. The danger posed by\nunchecked distribution and consumption of prescription pills by\nstudents certainly needs no elaboration.Judges are not qualified to second-guess the\nbest manner for maintaining quiet and order in the school\nenvironment. Such institutional judgments, like those concerning\nthe selection of the best methods for \u201crestrain[ing students] from\nassaulting one another, abusing drugs and alcohol, and committing\nother crimes,\u201did.,at 342, n.\u00a09, \u201cinvolve a host of\npolicy choices that must be made by locally elected\nrepresentatives, rather than by federal judges interpreting the\nbasic charter of Government for the entire country.\u201dCollinsv.Harker Heights,503 U. S. 115, 129\n(1992); cf.Regents of Univ. of Mich.v.Ewing,474 U. S. 214,\n226 (1985) (observing that federal courts are not \u201csuited to\nevaluat[ing] the substance of the multitude of academic decisions\u201d\nor disciplinary decisions \u201cthat are made daily by faculty members\nof public educational institutions\u201d). It is a mistake for judges to\nassume the responsibility for deciding which school rules are\nimportant enough to allow for invasive searches and which rules are\nnot.3Even if this Court were\nauthorized to second-guess the importance of school rules, the\nCourt\u2019s assessment of the importance of this district\u2019s policy is\nflawed. It is a crime to possess or use prescription-strength\nIbuprofen without a prescription. See Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann.\n\u00a713\u20133406(A)(1) (West Supp. 2008) (\u201cA person shall not knowingly \u2026\n[p]ossess or use a prescription-only drug unless the person obtains\nthe prescription-only drug pursuant to a valid prescription of a\nprescriber who is licensed pursuant to [state law]\u201d).[Footnote 5] By prohibiting unauthorized\nprescription drugs on school grounds\u2014and conducting a search to\nensure students abide by that prohibition\u2014the school rule here was\nconsistent with a routine provision of the state criminal code. It\nhardly seems unreasonable for school officials to enforce a rule\nthat, in effect, proscribes conduct that amounts to a crime.Moreover, school districts have\nvalid reasons for punishing the unauthorized possession of\nprescription drugs on school property as severely as the possession\nof street drugs; \u201c[t]eenage abuse of over-the-counter and\nprescription drugs poses an increasingly alarming national crisis.\u201d\nGet Teens Off Drugs, The Education Digest 75 (Dec. 2006). As one\nstudy noted, \u201cmore young people ages 12\u201317 abuse prescription drugs\nthan any illicit drug except marijuana\u2014more than cocaine, heroin,\nand methamphetamine combined.\u201d Executive Office of the President,\nOffice of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP), Prescription for\nDanger 1 (Jan. 2008) (hereinafter Prescription for Danger). And\naccording to a 2005 survey of teens, \u201cnearly one in five (19\npercent or 4.5 million) admit abusing prescription drugs in their\nlifetime.\u201d Columbia University, The National Center on Addiction\nand Substance Abuse (CASA), \u201cYou\u2019ve Got Drugs!\u201d V: Prescription\nDrug Pushers on the Internet 2 (July 2008); see also Dept. of\nHealth and Human Services, National Institute on Drug Abuse, High\nSchool and Youth Trends 2 (Dec. 2008) (\u201cIn 2008, 15.4 percent of\n12th-graders reported using a prescription drug nonmedically within\nthe past year\u201d).School administrators can reasonably conclude\nthat this high rate of drug abuse is being fueled, at least in\npart, by the increasing presence of prescription drugs on school\ncampuses. See,e.g.,Gibson, Grand Forks Schools See Rise\nIn Prescription Drug Abuse, Grand Forks Herald, Nov. 16, 2008,\np.\u00a01 (explaining that \u201cprescription drug abuse is growing into\na larger problem\u201d as students \u201cbring them to school and sell them\nor just give them to their friends\u201d).

But since 1999, there has \u201cbeen a dramatic\nincrease in the number of poisonings and even deaths associated\nwith the abuse of prescription drugs.\u201d Prescription for Danger 4;\nsee also Dept. of Health and Human Services, The NSDUH Report:\nTrends in Nonmedical Use of Prescription Pain Relievers: 2002 to\n2007, p.\u00a01 (Feb. 5, 2009) (\u201c[A]pproximately 324,000 emergency\ndepartment visits in 2006 involved the nonmedical use of pain\nrelievers\u201d); CASA, Under the Counter: The Diversion and Abuse of\nControlled Prescription Drugs in the U. S., p.\u00a025 (July 2005)\n(\u201cIn 2002, abuse of controlled prescription drugs was implicated in\nat least 23 percent of drug-related emergency department admissions\nand 20.4 percent of all single drug-related emergency department\ndeaths\u201d). At least some of these injuries and deaths are likely due\nto the fact that \u201c[m]ost controlled prescription drug abusers are\npoly-substance abusers,\u201did., at 3, a habit that is\nespecially likely to result in deadly drug combinations.\nFurthermore, even if a child is not immediately harmed by the abuse\nof prescription drugs, research suggests that prescription drugs\nhave become \u201cgateway drugs to other substances of abuse.\u201dId., at 4; Healy, Skipping the Street, Los Angeles Times,\nSept. 15, 2008, p. F1 (\u201cBoomers made marijuana their \u2018gateway\u2019 \u2026\nbut a younger generation finds prescription drugs an easier\nscore\u201d); see also National Survey 17 (noting that teens report\n\u201cthat prescription drugs are easier to buy than beer\u201d).Admittedly, the Ibuprofen and Naproxen at\nissue in this case are not the prescription painkillers at the\nforefront of the prescription-drug-abuse problem. See Prescription\nfor Danger 3 (\u201cPain relievers like Vicodin and OxyContin are the\nprescription drugs most commonly abused by teens\u201d). But they are\nnot without their own dangers. As nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory\ndrugs (NSAIDs), they pose a risk of death from overdose. The Pill\nBook 821, 827 (H.\u00a0Silverman, ed., 13th ed. 2008) (observing\nthat Ibuprofen and Naproxen are NSAIDs and \u201c[p]eople have died from\nNSAID overdoses\u201d). Moreover, the side-effects caused by the use of\nNSAIDs can be magnified if they are taken in combination with other\ndrugs. See,e.g.,Reactions Weekly, p.\u00a018 (Issue no.\n1235, Jan. 17, 2009) (\u201cA 17-year-old girl developed allergic\ninterstitial nephritis and renal failure while receiving\nescitalopram and ibuprofen\u201d);id., at 26 (Issue no. 1232,\nDec. 13, 2008) (\u201cA 16-month-old boy developed iron deficiency\nanaemia and hypoalbuminaemia during treatment with naproxen\u201d);id., at\u00a015 (Issue no. 1220, Sept. 20, 2008)\n(18-year-old \u201cwas diagnosed with pill-induced oesophageal\nperforation\u201d after taking ibuprofen \u201cand was admitted to the\n[intensive care unit]\u201d);id., at 20 (Issue no. 1170, Sept.\n22, 2007) (\u201cA 12-year-old boy developed anaphylaxis following\ningestion of ibuprofen\u201d).If a student with a previously unknown\nintolerance to Ibuprofen or Naproxen were to take either drug and\nbecome ill, the public outrage would likely be directed toward the\nschool for failing to take steps to prevent the unmonitored use of\nthe drug. In light of the risks involved, a school\u2019s decision to\nestablish and enforce a school prohibition on the possession of any\nunauthorized drug is thus a reasonable judgment.[Footnote 6]*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*In determining whether the\nsearch\u2019s scope was reasonable under the Fourth Amendment, it is\ntherefore irrelevant whether officials suspected Redding of\npossessing prescription-strength Ibuprofen,\nnonprescription-strength Naproxen, or some harder street drug.\nSafford prohibited its possession on school property. Reasonable\nsuspicion that Redding was in possession of drugs in violation of\nthese policies, therefore, justified a search extending to any area\nwhere small pills could be concealed. The search did not violate\nthe Fourth Amendment.IIBy declaring the search\nunreasonable in this case, the majority has \u201c\u00a0\u2018surrender[ed]\ncontrol of the American public school system to public school\nstudents\u2019\u00a0\u201d by invalidating school policies that treat all\ndrugs equally and by second-guessing swift disciplinary decisions\nmade by school officials. SeeMorse, 551 U. S., at 421\n(Thomas, J., concurring) (quotingTinkerv.Des Moines\nIndependent Community School Dist.,393 U. S. 503, 526\n(1969) (Black, J., dissenting)). The Court\u2019s interference in these\nmatters of great concern to teachers, parents, and students\nillustrates why the most constitutionally sound approach to the\nquestion of applying the Fourth Amendment in local public schools\nwould in fact be the complete restoration of the common-law\ndoctrine ofin loco parentis.\u201c[I]n the early years of public\nschooling,\u201d courts applied the doctrine ofin loco\nparentisto transfer to teachers the authority of a parent to\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018command obedience, to control stubbornness, to quicken\ndiligence, and to reform bad habits.\u2019\u00a0\u201dMorse,supra,at 413\u2013414 (Thomas, J., concurring) (quotingStatev.Pendergrass, 19 N.\u00a0C. 365, 365\u2013366\n(1837)). So empowered, schoolteachers and administrators had almost\ncomplete discretion to establish and enforce the rules they\nbelieved were necessary to maintain control over their classrooms.\nSee 2 J. Kent, Commentaries on American Law 205 (1873) (\u201cSo the\npower allowed by law to the parent over the person of the child may\nbe delegated to a tutor or instructor, the better to accomplish the\npurpose of education\u201d); 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws\nof England 441 (1765) (\u201cHe may also delegate part of his parental\nauthority, during his life, to the tutor or schoolmaster of his\nchild; who is thenin loco parentis, and has such a\nportion of the parent committed to his charge, viz. that of\nrestraint and correction, as may be necessary to answer the\npurposes for which he is employed\u201d).[Footnote 7] The perils of judicial policymaking inherent\nin applying Fourth Amendment protections to public schools counsel\nin favor of a return to the understanding that existed in this\nNation\u2019s first public schools, which gave teachers discretion to\ncraft the rules needed to carry out the disciplinary\nresponsibilities delegated to them by parents.If the common-law view that parents delegate\nto teachers their authority to discipline and maintain order were\nto be applied in this case, the search of Redding would stand.\nThere can be no doubt that a parent would have had the authority to\nconduct the search at issue in this case. Parents have \u201cimmunity\nfrom the strictures of the Fourth Amendment\u201d when it comes to\nsearches of a child or that child\u2019s belongings.T.\u00a0L.\u00a0O., 469 U. S., at 337; see alsoid., at 336 (A parent\u2019s authority is \u201cnot subject to the\nlimits of the Fourth Amendment\u201d);Griffinv.Wisconsin,483 U. S. 868, 876\n(1987) (\u201c[P]arental custodial authority\u201d does not require \u201cjudicial\napproval for [a] search of a minor child\u2019s room\u201d).As acknowledged by this Court, this principle\nis based on the \u201csocietal understanding of superior and inferior\u201d\nwith respect to the \u201cparent and child\u201d relationship.Georgiav.Randolph,547 U. S. 103, 114\n(2006). In light of this relationship, the Court has indicated that\na parent can authorize a third-party search of a child by\nconsenting to such a search, even if the child denies his consent.\nSeeibid.;see also 4 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure\n\u00a78.3(d), p. 160 (4th ed. 2004) (\u201c[A] father, as the head of the\nhousehold with the responsibility and the authority for the\ndiscipline, training and control of his children, has a superior\ninterest in the family residence to that of his minor son, so that\nthe father\u2019s consent to search would be effective notwithstanding\nthe son\u2019s contemporaneous on-the-scene objection\u201d (internal\nquotation marks omitted)). Certainly, a search by the parent\nhimself is no different, regardless of whether or not a child would\nprefer to be left alone. Seeid.,\u00a78.4(b), at 202 (\u201c[E]ven\n[if] a minor child \u2026 may think of a room as \u2018his,\u2019 the overall\ndominance will be in his parents\u201d (internal quotation marks\nomitted)).Restoring the common-law doctrine ofin\nloco parentiswould not, however, leave public schools\nentirely free to impose any rule they choose. \u201cIf parents do not\nlike the rules imposed by those schools, they can seek redress in\nschool boards or legislatures; they can send their children to\nprivate schools or home school them; or they can simply move.\u201d SeeMorse, 551 U. S., at 419 (Thomas, J., concurring). Indeed,\nparents and local government officials have proved themselves quite\ncapable of challenging overly harsh school rules or the enforcement\nof sensible rules in insensible ways.For example, one community questioned a school\npolicy that resulted in \u201can 11-year-old [being] arrested,\nhandcuffed, and taken to jail for bringing a plastic butter knife\nto school.\u201d Downey, Zero Tolerance Doesn\u2019t Always Add Up, The\nAtlanta Journal-Constitution, Apr. 6, 2009, p.\u00a0A11. In\nanother, \u201c[a]t least one school board member was outraged\u201d when 14\nelementary-school students were suspended for \u201cimitating drug\nactivity\u201d after they combined Kool-Aid and sugar in plastic bags.\nGrant, Pupils Trading Sweet Mix Get Sour Shot of Discipline,\nPittsburgh Post-Gazette, May 18, 2006, p. B1. Individuals within\nyet another school district protested a \u201c\u00a0\u2018zero-tolerance\u2019\npolicy toward weapons\u201d that had become \u201cso rigid that it force[d]\nschools to expel any student who belongs to a military\norganization, a drum-and-bugle corps or any other legitimate\nextracurricular group and is simply transporting what amounts to\nharmless props.\u201d Richardson, School Gun Case Sparks Cries For\n\u201cCommon Sense,\u201d Washington Times, Feb. 13, 2009, p. A1.[Footnote 8]These local efforts to change controversial\nschool policies through democratic processes have proven successful\nin many cases. See,e.g.,Postal, Schools\u2019 Zero Tolerance\nCould Lose Some Punch, Orlando Sentinel, Apr. 24, 2009, p. B3\n(\u201cState lawmakers want schools to dial back strict zero-tolerance\npolicies so students do not end up in juvenile detention for some\n\u2018goofy thing\u2019\u00a0\u201d); Richardson, Tolerance Waning for\nZero-tolerance Rules, Washington Times, Apr. 21, 2009, p. A3 (\u201c[A]\nfew states have moved to relax their laws. Utah now allows students\nto bring asthma inhalers to school without violating the\nzero-tolerance policy on drugs\u201d); see also Nussbaum, Becoming Fed\nUp With Zero Tolerance, New York Times, Sept. 3, 2000, Section 14,\np.\u00a01 (discussing a report that found that \u201cwidespread use of\nzero-tolerance discipline policies was creating as many problems as\nit was solving and that there were many cases around the country in\nwhich students were harshly disciplined for infractions where there\nwas no harm intended or done\u201d).In the end, the task of implementing and\namending public school policies is beyond this Court\u2019s function.\nParents, teachers, school administrators, local politicians, and\nstate officials are all better suited than judges to determine the\nappropriate limits on searches conducted by school officials.\nPreservation of order, discipline, and safety in public schools is\nsimply not the domain of the Constitution. And, common sense is not\na judicial monopoly or a Constitutional imperative.III\u201c[T]he nationwide drug epidemic\nmakes the war against drugs a pressing concern in every school.\u201dBoard of Ed. of Independent School Dist. No. 92 of Pottawatomie\nCty.v.Earls,536 U. S. 822, 834 (2002). And yet the\nCourt has limited the authority of school officials to conduct\nsearches for the drugs that the officials believe pose a serious\nsafety risk to their students. By doing so, the majority has\nconfirmed that a return to the doctrine ofin loco\nparentisis required to keep the judiciary from essentially\nseizing control of public schools. Only then will teachers again be\nable to \u201c\u00a0\u2018govern the[ir] pupils, quicken the slothful, spur\nthe indolent, restrain the impetuous, and control the\nstubborn\u2019\u00a0\u201d by making \u201c\u00a0\u2018rules, giv[ing] commands, and\npunish[ing] disobedience\u2019\u00a0\u201d without interference from judges.\nSeeMorse,supra, at 414. By deciding that it is\nbetter equipped to decide what behavior should be permitted in\nschools, the Court has undercut student safety and undermined the\nauthority of school administrators and local officials. Even more\ntroubling, it has done so in a case in which the underlying\nresponse by school administrators was reasonable and justified. I\ncannot join this regrettable decision. I, therefore, respectfully\ndissent from the Court\u2019s determination that this search violated\nthe Fourth Amendment.Footnote 1To be sure, Redding denied knowledge of the\npills and the materials in her planner. App. 14a. But her denial\nalone does not negate the reasonable suspicion held by school\nofficials. SeeNew Jerseyv.T.\u00a0L.\u00a0O.,469 U. S. 325, 345 (1985) (finding\nsearch reasonable even though \u201cT.\u00a0L.\u00a0O. had been accused\nof smoking, and had denied the accusation in the strongest possible\nterms when she stated that she did not smoke at all\u201d).Footnote 2Like the dissent below, \u201cI would reserve the\nterm \u2018strip search\u2019 for a search that required its subject to fully\ndisrobe in view of officials.\u201d 531 F.\u00a03d 1071, 1091, n.\u00a01\n(CA9 2008) (opinion of Hawkins, J.). The distinction between a\nstrip search and the search at issue in this case may be slight,\nbut it is a distinction that the law has drawn. See,e.g.,\nSandinv.Conner,515 U. S. 472, 475\n(1995) (\u201cThe officer subjected Conner to a strip search, complete\nwith inspection of the rectal area\u201d);Bellv.Wolfish,441 U. S. 520, 558, and\nn.\u00a039 (1979) (describing visual inspection of body cavities as\n\u201cpart of a strip search\u201d).Footnote 3The Court has adopted a different standard\nfor searches involving an \u201cintrusio[n] into the human body.\u201dSchmerberv.California,384 U. S. 757, 770\n(1966). The search here does not implicate the Court\u2019s cases\ngoverning bodily intrusions, however, because it did not involve a\n\u201cphysical intrusion, penetrating beneath the skin,\u201dSkinnerv.Railway Labor Executives\u2019 Assn.,489 U. S. 602,\n616 (1989).Footnote 4Justice Ginsburg suggests that requiring\nRedding to \u201csit on a chair outside [the assistant principal\u2019s]\noffice for over two hours\u201d and failing to call her parents before\nconducting the search constitutes an \u201c[a]buse of authority\u201d that\n\u201cshould not be shielded by official immunity.\u201d Seeante,\nat 1\u20132. But the school was under no constitutional obligation to\ncall Redding\u2019s parents before conducting the search:\n\u201c[R]easonableness under the Fourth Amendment does not require\nemploying the least intrusive means, because the logic of such\nelaborate less-restrictive-alternative arguments could raise\ninsuperable barriers to the exercise of virtually all\nsearch-and-seizure powers.\u201dBoard of Ed. of Independent School\nDist. No. 92 of Pottawatomie Cty.v.Earls,536 U. S. 822, 837 (2002) (internal\nquotation marks and brackets omitted). For the same reason, the\nConstitution did not require school officials to ask \u201cfollowup\nquestions\u201d after they had already developed reasonable suspicion\nthat Redding possessed drugs. Seeante, at 6, 10 (majority\nopinion);ante, at 1 (opinion of Ginsburg, J.). In any\nevent, the suggestion that requiring Redding to sit in a chair for\ntwo hours amounted to a deprivation of her constitutional rights,\nor that school officials are required to engage in detailed\ninterrogations before conducting searches for drugs, only\nreinforces the conclusion that the Judiciary is ill-equipped to\nsecond-guess the daily decisions made by public administrators. Cf.Beardv.Banks,548 U. S. 521, 536\u2013537\n(2006) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment).Footnote 5Arizona\u2019s law is not idiosyncratic; many\nStates have separately criminalized the unauthorized possession of\nprescription drugs. See,e.g., Mo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7577.628(1)\n(Supp. 2008) (\u201cNo person less than twenty-one years of age shall\npossess upon the real property comprising a public or private\nelementary or secondary school or school bus prescription\nmedication without a valid prescription for such medication\u201d);\nOkla. Stat., Tit. 59, \u00a7353.24(2) (Supp. 2008) (\u201cIt shall be\nunlawful for any person, firm or corporation to \u2026 [s]ell, offer for\nsale, barter or give away any unused quantity of drugs obtained by\nprescription, except \u2026 as provided by the State Board of\nPharmacy\u201d); Utah Code Ann. \u00a758\u201317b\u2013501(12) (Lexis 2007)\n(\u201c\u00a0\u2018Unlawful conduct\u2019 includes: using a prescription drug \u2026\nfor himself that was not lawfully prescribed for him by a\npractitioner\u201d); see also Ala. Code \u00a734\u201323\u20137 (2002); Del. Code Ann.,\nTit. 16, \u00a74754A(a)(4) (Supp. 2008); Fla. Stat. \u00a7499.005(14) (2007);\nN.\u00a0H. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7318:42(I) (Supp. 2008).Footnote 6Schools have a significant interest in\nprotecting all students from prescription drug abuse; young female\nstudents are no exception. See Teens and Prescription Drugs 2\n(\u201cPrescription drugs are the most commonly abused drug among\n12\u201313-year-olds\u201d). In fact, among 12- to 17-year-olds, females are\n\u201cmore likely than boys to have abused prescription drugs\u201d and have\n\u201chigher rates of dependence or abuse involving prescription drugs.\u201dId., at 5. Thus, rather than undermining the relevant\ngovernmental interest here, Redding\u2019s age and sex, if anything,\nincreased the need for a search to prevent the reasonably suspected\nuse of prescription drugs.Footnote 7The one aspect of school discipline with\nrespect to which the judiciary at times became involved was the\n\u201cimposition of excessive physical punishment.\u201dMorse, 551\nU. S., at 416 (Thomas, J., concurring). Some early courts found\ncorporal punishment proper \u201cas long as the teacher did not act with\nlegal malice or cause permanent injury;\u201d while other courts\nintervened only if the punishment was \u201cclearly excessive.\u201dIbid.(emphasis deleted and internal quotation marks\nomitted) (collecting decisions).Footnote 8See also,e.g., Smydo, Allderdice\nParents Decry Suspensions, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Apr. 16, 2009,\np.
