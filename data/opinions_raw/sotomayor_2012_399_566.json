While I too find the counterclaim not \u201cfree\nof ambiguity,\u201dante,at 10, I join the Court\u2019s opinion\nbecause I agree this is the most sensible reading in light of the\nexisting regulatory scheme. I write separately to add the following\nobservations.II first underscore that the counterclaim can\nonly lessen the difficulties created by an overly broad use code;\nit cannot fix them. The statutory scheme is designed to speed the\nintroduction of low-cost generic drugs to market. Seeante,at 2 (citingEli Lilly & Co.v.Medtronic, Inc.,496 U.S.\n661, 676 (1990)). To that end, the statute provides for the\nrapid approval of a drug that a generic manufacturer seeks to\nmarket for unpatented methods of use. The manufacturer need only\nsubmit an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) with a section\nviii statement and a proposed label that \u201ccarves out\u201d from the\nbrand manufacturer\u2019s label any patented methods of use. Seeante,at 4. So long as the use code is not overly broad (and\nall else is in order), FDA may approve the application without\nrequiring any further steps relating to the patent, and the generic\ndrug may reach the public without undue delay. Seeibid.An overly broad use code \u201cthrows a wrench\u201d into\nthat scheme.Ante,at 18. The reason why is simple: FDA\nrelies on use codes in determining whether to approve an ANDA, but\nit refuses to evaluate the accuracy of those use codes. Seeante,at 4\u20135. Thus, if the use code overlaps with the\ngeneric manufacturer\u2019s proposed carve-out label (i.e., if\nthe use code is overly broad), FDA will not approve an ANDA with a\nsection viii statement. Seeibid.After today\u2019s opinion, the generic manufacturer\ncan re-spond to this situation by taking the following steps:\nsub-mit an ANDA with a paragraph IV certification (which requires a\nproposed label materially identical to the brand manufacturer\u2019s\nlabel, seeante,at 24), wait for the brand manufacturer to\ninstitute suit, file a counterclaim, litigate the counterclaim,\nand, if successful in securing the correction of the use code,\nreturn to the start of the process and do what it always wanted to\ndo\u2014file an ANDA with a section viii statement and a carve-out\nlabel.The problem with this process is twofold. First,\nit results in delay and expense the statutory scheme does not\nenvision. Second, there is no guarantee the process will work. It\ndepends on the brand manufacturer initiating paragraph IV\nlitigation, but it is not obvious the brand will have any incentive\nto do so. In light of today\u2019s holding, the upshot of such\nlitigation will be the correction of the use code through the\nassertion of a counterclaim\u2014an outcome that is desirable, to be\nsure, for the generic manufacturer, but perhaps less so for the\nbrand manufacturer.Meanwhile, it is not clear what happens if the\nbrand manufacturer does not file suit. FDA may approve the generic\nmanufacturer\u2019s application, see 21 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7355(j)(5)(B)(iii), \u201cwithout prejudice to infringement claims the\npatent owner might assert when the ANDA applicant produces or\nmarkets the generic drug.\u201d Brief for United States asAmicus\nCuriae6 (hereinafter United States Brief). But the generic\nmanufacturer, having been forced to proceed with a paragraph IV\ncertification, will have se-cured approval to market a drug with a\nlabel materially identical to the brand manufacturer\u2019s. That is not\na position I imagine a generic manufacturer wants to be in: As the\nSolicitor General\u2019s Office informed us at argument, \u201c[i]t would be\ninducement of infringement to sell a product with labeling that\nsuggests that the product be used for a patented method of use.\u201d\nTr. of Oral Arg. 24; see also United States Brief 32 (noting that\nin this situation, if a generic manufacturer proceeded with a\nparagraph IV certification, \u201c[s]o long as the [new drug application\n(NDA)] holder\u2019s patent covers some approved method of using the\napproved drug, the proposed labeling will be infringing\u201d).In short, the counterclaim cannot restore the\nsmooth working of a statutory scheme thrown off kilter by an overly\nbroad use code. At best, it permits the generic manufacturer to do\nwhat the scheme contemplates it should do\u2014file an ANDA with a\nsection viii statement\u2014but only after expensive and time-consuming\nlitigation. A fix is in order, but it must come from Congress or\nFDA.IIPrecisely because the regulatory scheme\ndepends on the accuracy and precision of use codes, I find FDA\u2019s\nguidance as to what is required of brand manufacturers in use codes\nremarkably opaque. The relevant regulation states simply that a\nbrand manufacturer must provide \u201c[t]he description of the patented\nmethod of use as required for publication.\u201d 21 CFR\n\u00a7314.53(c)(2)(ii)(P)(3). The form on which brand manufacturers\nsubmit that information provides some additional detail, explaining\nthat \u201c[e]ach approved use claimed by the patent should be\nseparately identified .\u00a0.\u00a0. and contain adequate\ninformation to assist .\u00a0.\u00a0. applicants in determining\nwhether a listed method of use patent claims a use for which the .\n. . applicant is not seeking approval.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert.\n214a. But it also provides that brand manufacturers may \u201cus[e] no\nmore than 240 total characters including spaces,\u201did., at\n213a, and elsewhere FDA acknowledges \u201cthat in some cases 240\ncharacters may not fully describe the use as claimed in the\npatent.\u201d 68 Fed. Reg. 36683 (2003); see alsoibid.(indicating for this reason that use codes \u201care not meant to\nsubstitute for the applicant\u2019s review of the patent\u201d).Indeed, in some respects we are here today\nbecause of FDA\u2019s opacity in describing what is required of brand\nmanufacturers. In its initial NDA filing, Novo submitted a use code\nfor the \u2019358 patent that was not \u201coverly broad\u201d: It described\nnarrowly the single patented method of use. App. 54\u201355, 99. Some\nyears later FDA required that Novo amend its label to \u201c[r]eplace\nall the separate indications\u201d \u201cwith the following sentence:\n\u2018Prandin is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve\nglycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId., at 163\u2013164, 215. Novo then amended its use code to\ntrack the new label,id.,at 482\u2013486, explaining that the\namendment \u201ccorrespond[ed] with the change in labeling required by\nFDA,\u201did., at 483. Novo understood its amended use code to\ncomply with FDA regulations, likely on the ground it pressed before\nus: that the regulations permit a brand manufacturer to submit for\npublication in the Orange Book a description ofeitherthe\npatented method of useorthe indication (which refers to\n\u201cwhat a drug does,\u201dante, at 15, n. 7). Brief for\nRespondents 10, 22, 48\u201350.For the reasons explained by the Court, seeante,at 15, n.\u00a07, Novo is mistaken. But the company\ncan hardly be faulted for so thinking. The regulations also require\nsubmission of \u201ca description of each approved method of use or\nindication,\u201d 21 CFR \u00a7314.53(c)(2)(ii)(P)(1), and the form on which\nbrand manufacturers submit use codes requires \u201cinformation on the\nindication or method of use for the Orange Book \u2018Use Code\u2019\ndescription.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 213; see alsoibid.(explaining brand manufacturers should \u201c[s]ubmit the description of\nthe approved indication or method of use that you propose FDA\ninclude as the \u2018Use Code\u2019 in the Orange Book\u201d). Those sources at\nthe least suggest (as Novo thought) that a method of use here is\ndistinct from an indication and that either suffices as a use\ncode.Prior to enactment of the counterclaim\nprovision, Congress considered a bill that required brand\nmanufacturers to submit a \u201cdescription of the approved use covered\nby the [patent] claim,\u201d and that allowed a generic manufacturer to\nbring a civil action to correct that information. Seeante,at 20. Congress rejected the bill, in part over criticism that it\nwould encourage excess litigation.[1] Absent greater clarity from FDA concerning what is\nrequired of brand manufacturers in use codes, Congress\u2019 fears of\nun-due litigation may be realized.Notes1See,e.g.,148\nCong.
