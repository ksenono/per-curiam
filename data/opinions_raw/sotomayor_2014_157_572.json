JAMES ALVIN\nCASTLEMANon writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the sixth circuit[March 26, 2013]Justice Sotomayor\ndelivered the opinion of the Court.Recognizing that\n\u201c[f]irearms and domestic strife are a potentially deadly\ncombination,\u201d United States v. Hayes, 555 U.\u00a0S. 415, 427\n(2009) , Congress forbade the possession of firearms by anyone\nconvicted of \u201ca misdemeanor crime of domestic\nviolence.\u201d 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7922(g)(9). The\nrespondent, James Alvin Castleman, pleaded guilty to the\nmisdemeanor offense of having \u201cintentionally or knowingly\ncause[d] bodily injury to\u201d the mother of his child. App.27.\nThe question before us is whether this conviction qualifies as\n\u201ca misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.\u201d We hold\nthat it does.IAThis country\nwitnesses more than a million acts of domestic violence, and\nhundreds of deaths from domestic violence, each year.[1] See Georgia v. Randolph, 547 U.\u00a0S.\n103, 117\u2013118 (2006). Domestic violence often escalates in\nseverity over time, see Brief for Major Cities Chiefs Association\net\u00a0al. as Amici Curiae 13\u201315; Brief for National Network\nto End Domestic Violence et\u00a0al. as Amici Curiae 9\u201312,\nand the presence of a firearm increases the likelihood that it will\nescalate to homicide, see id., at 14\u201315; Campbell\net\u00a0al., Assessing Risk Factors for Intimate Partner Homicide,\nDOJ, Nat. Institute of Justice J., No. 250, p.\u00a016 (Nov. 2003)\n(\u201cWhen a gun was in the house, an abused woman was 6 times\nmore likely than other abused women to be killed\u201d).\n\u201c[A]ll too often,\u201d as one Senator noted during the\ndebate over \u00a7922(g)(9), \u201cthe only difference between a\nbattered woman and a dead woman is the presence of a gun.\u201d\n142 Cong. Rec. 22986 (1996) (statement of Sen. Wellstone).Congress enacted\n\u00a7922(g)(9), in light of these sobering facts, to\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018close [a] dangerous\nloophole\u2019\u00a0\u201d in the gun control laws: While felons\nhad long been barred from possessing guns, many perpetrators of\ndomestic violence are convicted only of misdemeanors. Hayes, 555 U.\nS., at 418, 426. Section 922(g)(9) provides, as relevant, that any\nperson \u201cwho has been convicted .\u00a0.\u00a0. of a\nmisdemeanor crime of domestic violence\u201d may not\n\u201cpossess in or affecting commerc[e] any firearm or\nammunition.\u201d With exceptions that do not apply here, the\nstatute defines a \u201cmisdemeanor crime of domestic\nviolence\u201d as\u201can offense that .\u00a0.\u00a0. (i)\nis a misdemeanor under Fed-eral, State, or Tribal law; and (ii)\nhas, as an element, the use or attempted use of physical force, or\nthe threatened use of a deadly weapon, committed by a current or\nformer spouse, parent, or guardian of the victim, by a person with\nwhom the victim shares a child in common, by a person who is\ncohabiting with or has cohabited with the victim as a spouse,\nparent, or guardian, or by a person similarly situated toa spouse,\nparent, or guardian of the victim.\u201d \u00a7921(a)(33)(A).This case concerns the meaning of one phrase in\nthis definition: \u201cthe use .\u00a0.\u00a0. of physical\nforce.\u201dBIn 2001, Castleman\nwas charged in a Tennessee court with having \u201cintentionally\nor knowingly cause[d] bodily injury to\u201d the mother of his\nchild, in violation of Tenn. Code Ann.\n\u00a739\u201313\u2013111(b) (Supp. 2002). App. 27. He pleaded\nguilty. Id., at 29.In 2008, federal\nauthorities learned that Castleman was selling firearms on the\nblack market. A grand jury in the Western District of Tennessee\nindicted him on two counts of violating \u00a7922(g)(9) and on\nother charges not relevant here. Id., at 13\u201316.Castleman moved to\ndismiss the \u00a7922(g)(9) charges, arguing that his Tennessee\nconviction did not qualify as a \u201cmisdemeanor crime of\ndomestic violence\u201d because it did not \u201cha[ve], as an\nelement, the use .\u00a0.\u00a0. of physical force,\u201d\n\u00a7921(a)(33)(A)(ii). The District Court agreed, on the the-ory\nthat \u201cthe \u2018use of physical force\u2019 for\n\u00a7922(g)(9) purposes\u201d must entail \u201cviolent contact\nwith the victim.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 40a. The court held\nthat a conviction under the relevant Tennessee statute cannot\nqualify as a \u201cmisdemeanor crime of domestic violence\u201d\nbecause one can cause bodily injury without \u201cviolent\ncontact\u201d\u2014for example, by \u201cdeceiving [the victim]\ninto drinking a poisoned beverage.\u201d Id., at 41a.A divided panel of the\nU.\u00a0S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed, by\ndifferent reasoning. 695 F.\u00a03d 582 (2012). The majority held\nthat the degree of physical force required by\n\u00a7921(a)(33)(A)(ii) is the same as required by\n\u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i), which defines \u201cviolent felony.\u201d\nId., at 587. Applying our decision in Johnson v. United States, 559\nU.\u00a0S. 133 (2010) , which held that \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i)\nre-quires \u201cviolent force,\u201d id., at 140, the majority\nheld that Castleman\u2019s conviction did not qualify as a\n\u201cmisdemeanor crime of domestic violence\u201d because\nCastleman could have been convicted for \u201ccaus[ing] a slight,\nnonserious physical injury with conduct that cannot be described as\nviolent.\u201d 695 F.\u00a03d, at 590. Judge McKeague dissented,\narguing both that the majority erred in extending Johnson\u2019s\ndefinition of a \u201cviolent felony\u201d to the context of a\n\u201cmisdemeanor crime of domestic violence\u201d and that, in\nany event, Castle-man\u2019s conviction satisfied the Johnson\nstandard. Id., at 593\u2013597.The Sixth\nCircuit\u2019s decision deepened a split of author-ity among the\nCourts of Appeals. Compare, e.g., United States v. Nason, 269\nF.\u00a03d 10, 18 (CA1 2001) (\u00a7922(g)(9) \u201cencompass[es]\ncrimes characterized by the application of any physical\nforce\u201d), with United States v. Belless, 338 F.\u00a03d 1063,\n1068 (CA9 2003) (\u00a7922(g)(9) covers only \u201cthe violent use\nof force\u201d). We granted certiorari to resolve this split, 570\nU.\u00a0S. ___ (2013), and now reverse the Sixth Cir-cuit\u2019s\njudgment.IIA\u201cIt is a\nsettled principle of interpretation that, absent other indication,\n\u2018Congress intends to incorporate the well-settled meaning of\nthe common-law terms it uses.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Sekhar v. United\nStates, 570 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 3). Seeing no\n\u201cother indication\u201d here, we hold that Congress\nincorporated the common-law meaning of\n\u201cforce\u201d\u2014namely, offensive touching\u2014in\n\u00a7921(a)(33)(A)\u2019s definition of a \u201cmis-demeanor\ncrime of domestic violence.\u201dJohnson resolves this\ncase in the Government\u2019s favor\u2014not, as the Sixth\nCircuit held, in Castleman\u2019s. In Johnson, we considered\nwhether a battery conviction was a \u201cviolent felony\u201d\nunder the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), \u00a7924(e)(1). As\nhere, ACCA defines such a crime as one that \u201chas as an\nelement the use .\u00a0.\u00a0. of physical force,\u201d\n\u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i). We began by observing that at common law,\nthe element of force in the crime of battery was \u201csatisfied\nby even the slightest offensive touching.\u201d 559 U.\u00a0S., at\n139 (citing 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England\n120 (1768)).[2] And we\nrecognized the general rule that \u201ca common-law term of art\nshould be given its established common-law meaning,\u201d except\n\u201cwhere that meaning does not fit.\u201d 559 U.\u00a0S., at\n139. We declined to read the common-law meaning of\n\u201cforce\u201d into ACCA\u2019s definition of a\n\u201cviolent felony,\u201d because we found it a \u201ccomical\nmisfit with the defined term.\u201d Id., at 145; see United States\nv. Stevens, 559 U.\u00a0S. 460, 474 (2010) (\u201c[A]n unclear\ndefinitional phrase may take meaning from the term to be\ndefined\u201d). In defining a \u201c\u00a0\u2018violent\nfelony,\u2019\u00a0\u201d we held, \u201cthe phrase\n\u2018physical force\u2019\u00a0\u201d must \u201cmea[n]\nviolent force.\u201d Johnson, 559 U.\u00a0S., at 140. But here,\nthe common-law meaning of \u201cforce\u201d fits perfectly: The\nvery reasons we gave for rejecting that meaning in defining a\n\u201cviolent felony\u201d are reasons to embrace it in defining\na \u201cmisdemeanor crime of domestic violence.\u201d[3]First, because\nperpetrators of domestic violence are \u201croutinely prosecuted\nunder generally applicable assault or battery laws,\u201d Hayes,\n555 U.\u00a0S., at 427, it makes sense for Congress to have\nclassified as a \u201cmisdemeanor crime of domestic\nviolence\u201d the type of conduct that supports a common-law\nbattery conviction. Whereas it was \u201cunlikely\u201d that\nCongress meant to incorporate in the definition of a\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018violent felony\u2019 a phrase that the common\nlaw gave peculiar meaning only in its definition of a\nmisdemeanor,\u201d Johnson, 559 U.\u00a0S., at 141, it is likely\nthat Congress meant to incorporate that misdemeanor-specific\nmeaning of \u201cforce\u201d in defining a \u201cmisdemeanor\ncrime of domestic violence.\u201dSecond, whereas the\nword \u201cviolent\u201d or \u201cviolence\u201d standing alone\n\u201cconnotes a substantial degree of force,\u201d id., at\n140,[4] that is not true of\n\u201cdomestic violence.\u201d \u201cDomestic violence\u201d is\nnot merely a type of \u201cviolence\u201d; it is a term of art\nencompassing acts that one might not characterize as\n\u201cviolent\u201d in a nondomestic context. See Brief for\nNational Network to End Domestic Violence et\u00a0al. as Amici\nCuriae 4\u20139; DOJ, Office on Violence Against Women, Domestic\nViolence (defining physical forms of domestic violence to include\n\u201c[h]itting, slapping, shoving, grabbing, pinching, biting,\n[and] hair pulling\u201d), online at\nhttp://www.ovw.usdoj.gov/domviolence.htm.[5] Indeed, \u201cmost physical assaults committed\nagainst women and men by intimates are relatively minor and consist\nof pushing, grabbing, shoving, slapping, and hitting.\u201d DOJ,\nP. Tjaden & N. Thoennes, Extent, Nature and Consequences of\nIntimate Partner Violence 11 (2000).Minor uses of force may\nnot constitute \u201cviolence\u201d in the generic sense. For\nexample, in an opinion that we cited with approval in Johnson, the\nSeventh Circuit noted that it was \u201chard to describe\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. as \u2018violence\u2019\u00a0\u201d \u201ca\nsqueeze of the arm [that] causes a bruise.\u201d Flores v.\nAshcroft, 350 F.\u00a03d 666, 670 (2003). But an act of this nature\nis easy to describe as \u201cdomestic violence,\u201d when the\naccumulation of such acts over time can subject one intimate\npartner to the other\u2019s control. If a seemingly minor act like\nthis draws the attention of authorities and leads to a successful\nprosecution for a misdemeanor offense, it does not offend common\nsense or the English language to characterize the resulting\nconviction as a \u201cmisdemeanor crime of domestic\nviolence.\u201dJustice Scalia\u2019s\nconcurrence discounts our reference to social-science definitions\nof \u201cdomestic violence,\u201d including those used by the\norganizations most directly engaged with the problem and thus most\naware of its dimensions. See post, at 8\u201311. It is important\nto keep in mind, how-ever, that the operative phrase we are\nconstruing is not \u201cdomestic violence\u201d; it is\n\u201cphysical force.\u201d \u00a7921(a)(33)(A). \u201cPhysical\nforce\u201d has a presumptive common-law meaning, and the question\nis simply whether that presumptive meaning makes sense in defining\na \u201cmisdemeanor crime of domestic violence.\u201d[6]A third reason for\ndistinguishing Johnson\u2019s definition of \u201cphysical\nforce\u201d is that unlike in Johnson\u2014where a determination\nthat the defendant\u2019s crime was a \u201cviolent felony\u201d\nwould have classified him as an \u201carmed career\ncriminal\u201d\u2014the statute here groups those convicted of\n\u201cmisdemeanor crimes of domestic violence\u201d with others\nwhose conduct does not warrant such a designation. Section 922(g)\nbars gun possession by anyone \u201caddicted to any controlled\nsubstance,\u201d \u00a7922(g)(3); by most people who have\n\u201cbeen admitted to the United States under a nonimmigrant\nvisa,\u201d \u00a7922(g)(5)(B); by anyone who has renounced United\nStates citizenship, \u00a7922(g)(7); and by anyone subject to a\ndomestic restraining order, \u00a7922(g)(8). Whereas we have\nhesitated (as in Johnson) to apply the Armed Career Criminal Act to\n\u201ccrimes which, though dangerous, are not typically committed\nby those whom one normally labels \u2018armed career\ncriminals,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Begay v. United States, 553\nU.\u00a0S. 137, 146 (2008) , we see no anomaly in grouping domestic\nabusers convicted of generic assault or battery offenses together\nwith the others whom \u00a7922(g) disqualifies from gun\nownership.An additional reason to\nread the statute as we do is that a contrary reading would have\nrendered \u00a7922(g)(9) inoperative in many States at the time of\nits enactment. The \u201cassault or battery laws\u201d under\nwhich \u201cdomestic abusers were .\u00a0.\u00a0. routinely\nprosecuted\u201d when Congress enacted \u00a7922(g)(9), and under\nwhich many are still prosecuted today, Hayes, 555 U.\u00a0S., at\n427, fall generally into two categories: those that prohibit both\noffensive touching and the causation of bodily injury, and those\nthat prohibit only the latter. See Brief for United States\n36\u201338. Whether or not the causation of bodily injury\nnecessarily entails violent force\u2014a question we do not\nreach\u2014mere offensive touching does not. See Johnson, 559\nU.\u00a0S., at 139\u2013140. So if offensive touching did not\nconstitute \u201cforce\u201d under \u00a7921(a)(33)(A), then\n\u00a7922(g)(9) would have been ineffec-tual in at least 10\nStates\u2014home to nearly thirty percent of the Nation\u2019s\npopulation[7]\u2014at the time\nof its enactment. See post, at 6, and n. 5 (Scalia, J., concurring\nin part and concurring in judgment) (acknowledging that\n\u00a7922(g)(9) would have been inapplicable in California and nine\nother States if it did not encompass offensive touching); App. to\nBrief for United States 10a\u201316a (listing statutes prohibiting\nboth offensive touching and the causation of bodily injury, only\nsome of which are divisible); cf. Hayes, 555 U.\u00a0S., at 427\n(rejecting an interpretation under which \u201c\u00a7922(g)(9)\nwould have been \u2018a dead letter\u2019 in some two-thirds of\nthe States from the very moment of its enactment\u201d).In sum, Johnson\nrequires that we attribute the common-law meaning of\n\u201cforce\u201d to \u00a7921(a)(33)(A)\u2019s definition of a\n\u201cmisdemeanor crime of domestic violence\u201d as an offense\nthat \u201chas, as an element, the use or attempted useof physical\nforce.\u201d We therefore hold that the requirement of\n\u201cphysical force\u201d is satisfied, for purposes of\n\u00a7922(g)(9), by the degree of force that supports a common-law\nbattery conviction.BApplying this\ndefinition of \u201cphysical force,\u201d we conclude that\nCastleman\u2019s conviction qualifies as a \u201cmisdemeanor\ncrime of domestic violence.\u201d In doing so, we follow the\nanalytic approach of Taylor v. United States, 495 U.\u00a0S. 575\n(1990) , and Shepard v. United States, 544 U.\u00a0S. 13 (2005) .\nWe begin with Taylor\u2019s categorical approach, under which we\nlook to the statute of Castleman\u2019s conviction to determine\nwhether that conviction necessarily \u201cha[d], as an element,\nthe use or attempted use of physical force, or the threatened use\nof a deadly weapon,\u201d \u00a7921(a)(33)(A).The Tennessee statute\nunder which Castleman was convicted made it a crime to\n\u201ccommi[t] an assault .\u00a0.\u00a0. against\u201d a\n\u201cfamily or household member\u201d\u2014in Castleman\u2019s\ncase, the mother of his child. Tenn. Code Ann.\n\u00a739\u201313\u2013111(b). A provision incorporated by\nreference, \u00a739\u201313\u2013101, defined three types of\nassault: \u201c(1) [i]ntentionally, knowingly or recklessly\ncaus[ing] bodily injury to another; (2) [i]ntentionally or\nknowingly caus[ing] another to reasonably fear imminent bodily\ninjury; or (3) [i]ntentionally or knowingly caus[ing] physical\ncontact with another\u201d in a manner that a \u201creasonable\nperson would regard .\u00a0.\u00a0. as extremely offensive or\nprovocative.\u201d \u00a739\u201313\u2013101(a).It does not appear that\nevery type of assault defined by \u00a739\u201313\u2013101\nnecessarily involves \u201cthe use or attempted use of physical\nforce, or the threatened use of a deadly weapon,\u201d\n\u00a7921(a)(33)(A). A threat under \u00a739\u201313\u2013101(2)\nmaynot necessarily involve a deadly weapon, and the merely reckless\ncausation of bodily injury under \u00a739\u201313\u2013101(1) may\nnot be a \u201cuse\u201d of force.[8]But we need not decide\nwhether a domestic assault conviction in Tennessee categorically\nconstitutes a \u201cmisdemeanor crime of domestic violence,\u201d\nbecause the parties do not contest that \u00a739\u201313\u2013101\nis a \u201c\u00a0\u2018divisible statute,\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nDescamps v. United States, 570 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip\nop., at 1). We may accordingly apply the modified categorical\napproach, consulting the indictment to which Castleman pleaded\nguilty in order to determine whether his conviction did entail the\nelements necessary to constitute the generic federal offense. Id.,\nat ___ (slip op., at 1\u20132); see Shepard, 544 U.\u00a0S., at\n26. Here, that analysis is straightforward: Castleman pleaded\nguilty to having \u201cintentionally or knowingly cause[d] bodily\ninjury\u201d to the mother of his child, App. 27, and the knowing\nor intentional causation of bodily injury necessarily involves the\nuse of physical force.First, a \u201cbodily\ninjury\u201d must result from \u201cphysical force.\u201d Under\nTennessee law, \u201cbodily injury\u201d is a broad term: It\n\u201cincludes a cut, abrasion, bruise, burn or disfigurement;\nphysical pain or temporary illness or impairment of the function of\na bodily member, organ, or mental faculty.\u201d Tenn. Code Ann.\n\u00a739\u201311\u2013106(a)(2) (1997). Justice Sca-lia\u2019s\nconcurrence suggests that these forms of injury ne-cessitate\nviolent force, under Johnson\u2019s definition of that phrase.\nPost, at 3. But whether or not that is so\u2014aquestion we do not\ndecide\u2014these forms of injury do necessitate force in the\ncommon-law sense.The District Court\nthought otherwise, reasoning that one can cause bodily injury\n\u201cwithout the \u2018use of physical\nforce\u2019\u00a0\u201d\u2014for example, by \u201cdeceiving\n[the victim] into drinking a poisoned beverage, without making\ncontact of any kind.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 41a. But as we\nexplained in Johnson, \u201cphysical force\u201d is simply\n\u201cforce exerted by and through concrete bodies,\u201d as\nopposed to \u201cintellectual force or emotional force.\u201d 559\nU.\u00a0S., at 138. And the common-law concept of\n\u201cforce\u201d encompasses even its indirect ap-plication.\n\u201cForce\u201d in this sense \u201cdescrib[es] one of the\nelements of the common-law crime of battery,\u201d id., at 139,\nand \u201c[t]he force used\u201d in battery \u201cneed not be\napplied directly to the body of the victim.\u201d 2 W. LaFave,\nSubstan-tive Criminal Law \u00a716.2(b) (2d ed. 2003). \u201c[A]\nbattery may be committed by administering a poison or by infecting\nwith a disease, or even by resort to some intangible\nsubstance,\u201d such as a laser beam. Ibid. (footnote omitted)\n(citing State v. Monroe, 121 N.\u00a0C. 677, 28 S.\u00a0E. 547\n(1897) (poison); State v. Lankford, 29 Del. 594, 102 A. 63 (1917)\n(disease); Adams v. Commonwealth, 33 Va. App. 463, 534\nS.\u00a0E.\u00a02d 347 (2000) (laser beam)). It is impossible to\ncause bodily injury without applying force in the common-law\nsense.Second, the knowing or\nintentional application of force is a \u201cuse\u201d of force.\nCastleman is correct that under Leocal v. Ashcroft, 543 U.\u00a0S.\n1 (2004) , the word \u201cuse\u201d \u201cconveys the idea that\nthe thing used (here, \u2018physical force\u2019) has been made\nthe user\u2019s instrument.\u201d Brief for Respondent 37. But he\nerrs in arguing that although \u201c[p]oison may have\n\u2018forceful physical properties\u2019 as a matter of organic\nchemistry, .\u00a0.\u00a0. no one would say that a poisoner\n\u2018employs\u2019 force or \u2018carries out a purpose by\nmeans of force\u2019 when he orshe sprinkles poison in a\nvictim\u2019s drink,\u201d ibid. The \u201cuseof force\u201d in\nCastleman\u2019s example is not the act of\n\u201csprinkl[ing]\u201d the poison; it is the act of employing\npoison knowingly as a device to cause physical harm. That the harm\noccurs indirectly, rather than directly (as with a kick or punch),\ndoes not matter. Under Castleman\u2019s logic, after all, one\ncould say that pulling the trigger on a gun is not a \u201cuse of\nforce\u201d because it is the bullet, not the trigger, that\nactually strikes the victim. Leocal held that the \u201cuse\u201d\nof force must entail \u201ca higher degree of intent than\nnegligent or merely accidental conduct,\u201d 543 U.\u00a0S., at\n9; it did not hold that the word \u201cuse\u201d somehow alters\nthe meaning of \u201cforce.\u201dBecause\nCastleman\u2019s indictment makes clear that the use of physical\nforce was an element of his conviction, that conviction qualifies\nas a \u201cmisdemeanor crime of domestic violence.\u201dIIIWe are not persuaded\nby Castleman\u2019s nontextual arguments against our\ninterpretation of \u00a7922(g)(9).AFirst, Castleman\ninvokes \u00a7922(g)(9)\u2019s legislative history to suggest that\nCongress could not have intended for the provision to apply to acts\ninvolving minimal force. But to the extent that legislative history\ncan aid in the inter-pretation of this statute, Castleman\u2019s\nreliance on it is unpersuasive.Castleman begins by\nobserving that during the debate over \u00a7922(g)(9), several\nSenators argued that the provision would help to prevent gun\nviolence by perpetrators of severe domestic abuse. Senator\nLautenberg referred to \u201cserious spousal or child abuse\u201d\nand to \u201cviolent individuals\u201d; Senator Hutchison to\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018people who batter their\nwives\u2019\u00a0\u201d; Senator Wellstone to people who\n\u201cbrutalize\u201d their wives or children; and Senator\nFeinstein to \u201csevere and recurring domestic violence.\u201d\n142 Cong. Rec. 22985\u201322986, 22988. But as we noted above, see\nsupra, at 2, the impetus of \u00a7922(g)(9) was that even\nperpetrators of severe domestic violence are often convicted\n\u201cunder generally applicable assault or battery laws.\u201d\nHayes, 555 U.\u00a0S., at 427. So nothing about these\nSenators\u2019 isolated references to severe domestic violence\nsuggests that they would not have wanted \u00a7922(g)(9) to apply\nto a misdemeanor assault conviction like Castleman\u2019s.Castleman next observes\nthat \u00a7922(g)(9) is the product of a legislative compromise.\nThe provision originally barred gun possession for any \u201ccrime\nof domestic violence,\u201d defined as any \u201cfelony or\nmisdemeanor crime of violence, regardless of length, term, or\nmanner of punishment.\u201d 142 Cong. Rec. 5840. Congress rewrote\nthe provision to require the use of physical force in response to\nthe concern \u201cthat the term crime of violence was too broad,\nand could be interpreted to include an act such as cutting up a\ncredit card with a pair of scissors,\u201d id., at 26675. See\nHayes, 555 U.\u00a0S., at 428. Castleman would have us conclude\nthat Congress thus meant \u201cto narrow the scope of the statute\nto convictions based on especially severe conduct.\u201d Brief for\nRespondent 24. But all Congress meant to do was address the fear\nthat \u00a7922(g)(9) might be triggered by offenses in which no\nforce at all was directed at a person. As Senator Lautenberg noted,\nthe revised text was not only \u201cmore precise\u201d than the\noriginal but also \u201cprobably broader.\u201d 142 Cong. Rec.\n26675.BWe are similarly\nunmoved by Castleman\u2019s invocation of the rule of lenity.\nCastleman is correct that our \u201cconstruction of a criminal\nstatute must be guided by the need for fair warning.\u201d Crandon\nv. United States, 494 U.\u00a0S. 152, 160 (1990) . But \u201cthe\nrule of lenity only applies if, after considering text, structure,\nhistory, and purpose, there remains a grievous ambiguity or\nuncertainty in the statute, such that the Court must simply guess\nas to what Congress intended.\u201d Barber v. Thomas, 560\nU.\u00a0S. 474, 488 (2010) (citation and internal quotation marks\nomitted). That is not the case here.CFinally, Castleman\nsuggests\u2014in a single paragraph\u2014that we should read\n\u00a7922(g)(9) narrowly because it implicates his constitutional\nright to keep and bear arms. But Castleman has not challenged the\nconstitutionality of \u00a7922(g)(9), either on its face or as\napplied to him, and the meaning of the statute is sufficiently\nclear that we need not indulge Castleman\u2019s cursory nod to\nconstitutional avoidance concerns.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*Castleman\u2019s\nconviction for having \u201cintentionally or knowingly cause[d]\nbodily injury to\u201d the mother of his child qualifies as a\n\u201cmisdemeanor crime of domestic violence.\u201d The judgment\nof the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit is\ntherefore reversed, and the case is remanded for further\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.Notes1See Dept. of Justice\n(DOJ), Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS), J.

And these\nreasons for declining to extend \u2019s definition to\n\u00a7922(g)(9) serve equally to rebut the \u201cpresumption of\nconsistent usage\u201d on which \u2019s concurrence heavily\nrelies, at1\u20132, 4.4This portion of \u2019s\nanalysis relied heavily on v. , , in which we interpreted the\nmeaning of a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under . As in and\nhere, the statute defines a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d in part\nas one \u201cthat has as an element the use .\u00a0.\u00a0. of\nphysical force,\u201d \u00a716(a). In support of our holding in ,\nwe quoted \u2019s observation that \u201c\u00a0\u2018[t]he\nordinary meaning of [a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d]\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. suggests a category of violent, active\ncrimes.\u2019\u00a0\u201d 559 U.\u00a0S., at 140 (quoting 543\nU.\u00a0S., at 11).5See also A.

McCue,\nDomestic Violence: A Reference Handbook 6 (1995) (noting that\nphysical forms of domestic violence \u201cmay begin with\nrelatively minor assaults such as painful pinching or\nsqueezing\u201d).6The concurrence\u2019s\nreliance on definitions of \u201cdomestic violence\u201d in other\nstatutory provisions, see at 8, and n. 7, is similarly\nunpersuasive. These other provisions show that when Congress wished\nto define \u201cdomestic violence\u201d as a type of\n\u201cviolence\u201d , it knew how to do so. That it did not do\nso here suggests, if anything, that it did not mean to. See, v., .\nThis also answers the concurrence\u2019s suggestion, at 10, that\nour holding will somehow make it difficult for Congress to define\n\u201cdomestic violence\u201d\u2014where it wants to\u2014as\nrequiring violent force.7See U.\u00a0S.

Al-though reserved the question whether a\nreckless application of force could constitute a \u201cuse\u201d\nof force, at 13, the Courts of Appeals have almost uniformly held\nthat recklessness is not sufficient.
