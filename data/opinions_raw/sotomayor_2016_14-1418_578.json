Lower courts, therefore, should not construe either today\u2019sper curiamor our order of March 29, 2016, as signals of\nwhere this Court stands. We have included similarly explicit\ndisclaimers in previous orders. See,e.g., Wheaton Collegev.Burwell, 573 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2014) (\u201c[T]his order should\nnot be construed as an expression of the Court\u2019s views on the\nmerits\u201d). Yet some lower courts have ignored those instructions.\nSee,e.g.,Sharpe Holdings, Inc., v.Department of\nHealth and Human Servs., 801 F.\u00a03d 927, 944 (CA8 2015)\n(\u201c[I]nWheaton College, Little Sisters of the Poor, andZubik, the Supreme Court approved a method of notice to HHS\nthat is arguably less onerous than [existing regulations] yet\npermits the government to further its interests. Although the\nCourt\u2019s orders were not final rulings on the merits, they at the\nvery least collectively constitute a signal that less restrictive\nmeans exist by which the government may further its interests\u201d). On\nremand in these cases, the Courts of Appeals should not make the\nsame mistake.I also join the Court\u2019s opinion because it\nallows the lower courts to consider only whether existing or\nmodified regulations could provide seamless contraceptive coverage\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018to petitioners\u2019 employees, through petitioners\u2019 insurance\ncompanies, without any\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. notice from\npetitioners.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAnte,at 3. The opinion does not, by\ncontrast, endorse the petitioners\u2019 position that the existing\nregulations substantially burden their religious exercise or that\ncontraceptive coverage must be provided through a \u201cseparate policy,\nwith a separate enrollment process.\u201d Supp. Brief for Petitioners 1;\nSupp. Reply Brief for Petitioners 5. Such separate\ncontraceptive-only policies do not currently exist, and the\nGovernment has laid out a number of legal and practical obstacles\nto their creation. See Supp. Reply Brief for Respondents 3\u20134.\nRequiring standalone contraceptive-only coverage would leave in\nlimbo all of the women now guaranteed seamless preventive-care\ncoverage under the Affordable Care Act. And requiring that women\naffirmatively opt into such coverage would \u201cimpose precisely the\nkind of barrier to the delivery of preventive services that\nCongress sought to eliminate.\u201dId., at 6.Today\u2019s opinion does only what it says it does:\n\u201cafford[s] an opportunity\u201d for the parties and Courts of Appeals to\nreconsider the parties\u2019 arguments in light of petitioners\u2019 new\narticulation of their religious objection and the Government\u2019s\nclarification about what the existing regulations accomplish, how\nthey might be amended, and what such an amendment would sacrifice.Ante,at 4. As enlightened by the parties\u2019 new submissions,\nthe Courts of Appeals remain free to reach the same conclusion or a\ndifferent one on each of the questions presented by these\ncases.",
