MITCHELL, PETITIONERv.WISCONSINon writ of certiorari to the supreme court of\nwisconsin[June 27, 2019]Justice Thomas, concurring in the\njudgment.Today, the plurality adopts a\ndifficult-to-administer rule: Exigent circumstances are generally\npresent when police encounter a person suspected of drunk\ndriving\u2014except when they aren\u2019t. Compareante, at 13, withante, at 16. The plurality\u2019s presumption will rarely be\nrebutted, but it will nevertheless burden both officers and courts\nwho must attempt to apply it. \u201cThe better (and far simpler) way to\nresolve\u201d this case is to apply \u201ctheper\u00a0serule\u201d I\nproposed inMissouriv.McNeely,569 U.S.\n141(2013) (dissenting opinion).Birchfieldv.North\nDakota, 579 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2016) (Thomas, J., concurring\nin judgment in part and dissenting in part) (slip op., at 3). Under\nthat rule, the natural metabolization of alcohol in the blood\nstream \u201c\u00a0\u2018creates an exigency once police have probable cause\nto believe the driver is drunk,\u2019\u00a0\u201d regardless of whether the\ndriver is conscious.Id.,at ___ (slip op., at 4). Be- cause\nI am of the view that the Wisconsin Supreme Court should apply that\nrule on remand, I concur only in the judgment.IThe Fourth Amendment provides that \u201c[t]he\nright of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers,\nand effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not\nbe violated.\u201d Although the Fourth Amendment does not, by its text,\nrequire that searches be supported by a warrant, seeGrohv.Ramirez,540 U.S.\n551, 571\u2013573 (2004) (Thomas, J., dissenting), \u201cthis Court has\ninferred that a warrant must generally be secured\u201d for a search to\ncomply with the Fourth Amendment,Kentuckyv.King,563 U.S.\n452, 459 (2011). We have also recognized, however, that this\nwarrant presumption \u201cmay be overcome in some circumstances because\n\u2018[t]he ultimate touchstone of the Fourth Amendment is\n\u201creasonableness.\u201d\u00a0\u2019\u00a0\u201dIbid.Accordingly, we have\nheld that \u201cthe warrant requirement is subject to certain reasonable\nexceptions.\u201dIbid.In recent years, this Court has twice considered\nwhether warrantless blood draws fall within an exception to the\nwarrant requirement. First, inMcNeely, a divided court held\nthat the natural metabolization of alcohol in the bloodstream does\nnot present aper\u00a0seexigency that justifies an\nexception to the Fourth Amendment\u2019s warrant requirement. 569\nU.\u00a0S., at 145. Then, inBirchfield, we held that blood\ndraws may not be administered as a search incident to a lawful\narrest for drunk driving. 579 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 35).\nThe question we face in this case is whether the blood draw here\nfell within one of the \u201creasonable exceptions\u201d to the warrant\nrequirement.IIThe \u201cexigent circumstances\u201d exception applies\nwhen \u201cthe needs of law enforcement [are] so compelling that [a]\nwarrantless search is objectively reasonable under the Fourth\nAmendment.\u201dKing, 563 U.\u00a0S., at 460 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). Applying this doctrine, the Court has held that\nofficers may conduct a warrantless search when failure to act would\nresult in \u201cthe imminent destruction of evidence.\u201dIbid.(internal quotation marks omitted).As I have explained before, \u201cthe imminent\ndestruction of evidence\u201d is a risk in every drunk-driving arrest\nand thus \u201cimplicates the exigent-circumstances doctrine.\u201dMcNeely, 569 U.\u00a0S., at 178. \u201cOnce police arrest a\nsuspect for drunk driving, each passing minute eliminates probative\nevidence of the crime\u201d as alcohol dissipates from the bloodstream.Id., at 177. In many States, this \u201crapid destruction of\nevidence,\u201did.,at 178, is particularly problematic because\nthe penalty for drunk driving depends in part on the driver\u2019s blood\nalcohol concentration, seeante, at 11. Because the\nprovisions of Wisconsin law at issue here allow blood draws only\nwhen the driver is suspected of impaired driving,ante, at\n2\u20133, they fit easily within the exigency exception to the warrant\nrequirement.Instead of adopting this straightforward rule,\nthe plurality makes a flawed distinction between ordinary\ndrunk-driving cases in which blood alcohol concentration evidence\n\u201cis dissipating\u201d and those that also include \u201csome other [pressing]\nfactor.\u201dAnte, at 6, 13, 16. But whether \u201csome other factor\ncreates pressing health, safety, or law-enforcement needs that\nwould take priority over a warrant application\u201d is irrelevant.Ante, at 13. When police have probable cause to conclude\nthat an individual was driving drunk, probative evidence is\ndissipating by the minute. And that evidence dissipates regardless\nof whether police had another reason to draw the driver\u2019s blood or\nwhether \u201ca warrant application would interfere with other pressing\nneeds or duties.\u201dAnte, at 16. The destruction of evidence\nalone is sufficient to justify a warrantless search based on\nexigent circumstances. See generallyMcNeely, 569\nU.\u00a0S., at 176\u2013179 (opinion of Thomas, J.).Presumably, the plurality draws these lines to\navoid overturningMcNeely. Seeid., at 156 (majority\nopinion) (holding that \u201cthe natural dissipation of alcohol in the\nblood\u201d does not \u201ccategorically\u201d support a finding of exi- gency).\nButMcNeelywas wrongly decided, seeid., at 176\u2013183\n(opinion of Thomas, J.), and our decision inBirchfieldhas\nalready undermined its rationale. Specifically, the Court\ndetermined inMcNeelythat \u201c[t]he context of blood testing\nis different in critical respects from other\ndestruction-of-evidence cases in which the police are truly\nconfronted with a now or never situation.\u201d 569 U.\u00a0S., at 153\n(majority opinion) (internal quotation marks omitted). But the\nCourt stated inBirchfieldthat a distinction between \u201can\narrestee\u2019s active destruction of evidence and the loss of evidence\ndue to a natural process makes little sense.\u201d 579 U.\u00a0S., at\n___ (slip op., at 31); see alsoante, at 11\u201312. Moreover, to\nthe extentMcNeelywas grounded in the belief that aper\u00a0serule was inconsistent with the \u201ccase by case,\u201d\n\u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d analysis ordinarily applied in\nexigent-circumstances cases, see 569 U.\u00a0S., at 156, that\nrationale was suspect from the start. That the\nexigent-circumstances exception might ordinarily require \u201can\nevaluation of the particular facts of each case,\u201dBirchfield,supra, at ___ (slip op., at 32), does not\nforeclose us from recognizing that a certain, dispositive fact is\nalways present in some categories of cases. In other words,\nacknowledging that destruction of evidence is at issue in every\ndrunk-driving case does not undermine the general\ntotality-of-the-circumstances approach thatMcNeelyandBirchfieldendorsed. Cf.ante, at 9, n.\u00a03.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*The Court has consistently held that police\nofficers may perform searches without a warrant when destruction of\nevidence is a risk.United Statesv.Banks, 540 U.S.\n31, 38 (2003);Richardsv.Wisconsin,520 U.S.\n385, 395 (1997);Cuppv.Murphy,412 U.S.\n291, 295\u2013296 (1973);Schmerberv.California,384 U.S.\n757, 770\u2013772 (1966). The rule should be no different in\ndrunk-driving cases. Because the plurality instead adopts a rule\nmore likely to confuse than clarify, I concur only in the\njudgment.",
