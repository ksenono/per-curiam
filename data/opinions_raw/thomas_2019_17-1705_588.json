I write\nseparately to address a more fundamental problem with that court\u2019s\nholding: It rests on a mistaken\u2014and possibly\nunconstitutional\u2014understanding of the relationship between federal\nstatutes and the agency orders interpreting them.The opinion below assumes that an executive\nagency\u2019s interpretation of a statute it administers serves as an\nauthoritative gloss on the statutory text unless timely challenged.\nBut for that assumption, the Hobbs Act would have no role to play\nin this case. This suit is a dispute between private parties, and\npetitioners did not ask the District Court to \u201cenjoin, set aside,\nsuspend,\u201d or \u201cdetermine the validity of\u201d any order of the Federal\nCommunications Commission (FCC). 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72342(1).\nIndeed, they did not even initiate this suit. They simply argued\nthat the fax at issue here was not an \u201cunsolicited advertisement\u201d\nand thus did not violate the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of\n1991 (TCPA), as respondent contended. See 47 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7\u00a7227(a)(5), (b)(1)(C). The District Court agreed, but the Fourth\nCircuit reversed, explaining that the FCC had adopted an order\ninterpreting the term \u201cunsolicited advertisement\u201d and that, under\nthe Hobbs Act, only the Courts of Appeals had jurisdiction to\n\u201cdetermine the validity of\u201d such orders. \u00a72342; see 883 F.3d 459,\n464 (2018). According to the decision below, the Hobbs Act\n\u201cprecluded the district court from evenreaching\u201d the\nquestion of the TCPA\u2019s meaning because \u201ca district court simply\ncannot reach [that] question without \u2018rubbing up against the Hobbs\nAct\u2019s jurisdictional bar.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIbid.(emphasis\nadded).As Justice Kavanaugh explains, the Fourth\nCircuit was incorrect. Interpreting a statute does not \u201cdetermine\nthe validity\u201d of an agency order interpreting or implementing the\nstatute. Seepost, at 11\u201313 (opinion concurring in\njudgment).[1]A contrary view would arguably render the Hobbs\nAct unconstitutional. If the Act truly \u201cprecluded the district\ncourt from even reaching\u201d the text of the TCPA and instead required\ncourts to treat \u201cFCC interpretations of the TCPA\u201d as authoritative,\n883 F.\u00a03d, at 464, then the Act would trench upon Article\nIII\u2019s vesting of the \u201cjudicial Power\u201d in the courts. As I have\nexplained elsewhere, \u201cthe judicial power, as originally understood,\nrequires a court to exercise its independent judgment in\ninterpreting and expounding upon the laws.\u201dPerezv.Mortgage Bankers Assn., 575 U.S. 92, ___ (2015) (opinion\nconcurring in judgment) (slip op., at 8). That duty necessarily\nentails identifying and applying the governing law. Insofar as the\nHobbs Act purports to prevent courts from applying the governing\nstatute to a case or controversy within its jurisdiction, the Act\nconflicts with the \u201cprovince and duty of the judicial department to\nsay what the law is.\u201dMarburyv.Madison, 1 Cranch\n137, 177 (1803). And to the extent the Hobbs Act requires courts to\n\u201cgive the \u2018force of law\u2019 to agency pronouncements on matters of\nprivate conduct\u201d without regard to the text of the governing\nstatute, the Act would be unconstitutional for the additional\nreason that it would \u201cpermit a body other than Congress\u201d to\nexercise the legislative power, in violation of Article I.Michiganv.EPA, 576 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2015)\n(Thomas, J., concurring) (slip op., at 3). At a minimum, our\nconstitutional-avoidance precedents would militate against the\nFourth Circuit\u2019s view of the Hobbs Act.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*The decision below rested on the assumption\nthat Congress can constitutionally require federal courts to treat\nagency orders as controlling law, without regard to the text of the\ngoverning statute. A similar assumption underlies our precedents\nrequiring judicial deference to certain agency interpretations. SeeChevron U.\u00a0S.\u00a0A. Inc.v.Natural Resources\nDefense Council, Inc.,467 U.S.\n837(1984). This case proves the error of that assumption and\nemphasizes the need to reconsider it.Notes1Contrary to the majority\u2019s\nsuggestion,ante,at 5, it therefore makes no difference\nwhether the FCC order at issue here is a legislative rule or an\ninterpretive rule. In any event, the order is clearly\ninterpretive\u2014it was \u201c\u00a0\u2018issued by an agency to advise the\npublic of the agency\u2019s construction of\u00a0\u2019\u00a0\u201d the term\n\u201cunsolicited advertisement.\u201dPerezv.Mortgage Bankers\nAssn., 575 U.S. 92, ___ (2015) (slip op., at 3).",
