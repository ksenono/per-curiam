S. ____ (2010)SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESNO. 08-205CITIZENS UNITED, APPELLANTv.FEDERAL\nELECTION COMMISSIONon appeal from the united states district court for\nthe district of columbia[January 21, 2010]Justice Thomas, concurring in\npart and dissenting in part.I join all but Part IV of the\nCourt\u2019s opinion.Political speech is entitled to robust\nprotection under the First Amendment. Section 203 of the Bipartisan\nCampaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA) has never been reconcilable with\nthat protection. By striking down \u00a7203, the Court takes an\nimportant first step toward restoring full constitutional\nprotection to speech that is \u201cindispensable to the effective and\nintelligent use of the processes of popular government.\u201dMcConnellv.Federal Election Comm\u2019n,540 U. S. 93, 265 (2003)\n(Thomas, J., concurring in part, concurring in judgment in part,\nand dissenting in part) (internal quotation marks omitted). I\ndissent from Part IV of the Court\u2019s opinion, however, because the\nCourt\u2019s constitutional analysis does not go far enough. The\ndisclosure, disclaimer, and reporting requirements in BCRA \u00a7\u00a7201\nand 311 are also unconstitutional. Seeid.,at 275\u2013277,\nand n.\u00a010.Congress may not abridge the \u201cright to\nanonymous speech\u201d based on the \u201c\u00a0\u2018simple interest in providing\nvoters with additional relevant information,\u2019\u00a0\u201did.,\nat 276 (quotingMcIntyrev.Ohio Elections\nComm\u2019n,514 U.\nS. 334, 348 (1995)). In continuing to hold otherwise, the Court\nmisapprehends the import of \u201crecent events\u201d that someamicidescribe \u201cin which donors to certain causes were\nblacklisted, threatened, or otherwise targeted for retaliation.\u201dAnte, at 54. The Court properly recognizes these events as\n\u201ccause for concern,\u201dibid., but fails to acknowledge their\nconstitutional significance. In my view,amici\u2019s\nsubmissions show why the Court\u2019s insistence on upholding \u00a7\u00a7201 and\n311 will ultimately prove as misguided (and ill fated) as was its\nprior approval of \u00a7203.Amici\u2019s examples relate principally\nto Proposition 8, a state ballot proposition that California voters\nnarrowly passed in the 2008 general election. Proposition 8 amended\nCalifornia\u2019s constitution to provide that \u201c[o]nly marriage between\na man and a woman is valid or recognized in California.\u201d Cal.\nConst., Art. I, \u00a77.5. Any donor who gave more than $100 to any\ncommittee supporting or opposing Proposition 8 was required to\ndisclose his full name, street address, occupation, employer\u2019s name\n(or business name, if self-employed), and the total amount of his\ncontributions.[Footnote 1] See\nCal. Govt. Code Ann. \u00a784211(f) (West 2005). The California\nSecretary of State was then required to post this information on\nthe Internet. See \u00a7\u00a784600\u201384601; \u00a7\u00a784602\u201384602.1 (West Supp. 2010);\n\u00a7\u00a784602.5\u201384604 (West 2005); \u00a785605 (West Supp. 2010);\n\u00a7\u00a784606\u201384609 (West 2005).Some opponents of Proposition 8 compiled this\ninformation and created Web sites with maps showing the locations\nof homes or businesses of Proposition 8 supporters. Many supporters\n(or their customers) suffered property damage, or threats of\nphysical violence or death, as a result. They cited these incidents\nin a complaint they filed after the 2008 election, seeking to\ninvalidate California\u2019s mandatory disclosure laws. Supporters\nrecounted being told: \u201cConsider yourself lucky. If I had a gun I\nwould have gunned you down along with each and every other\nsupporter,\u201d or, \u201cwe have plans for you and your friends.\u201d Complaint\ninProtectMarriage.com\u2014Yes on 8v.Bowen, Case\nNo. 2:09\u2013cv\u201300058\u2013MCE\u2013DAD (ED Cal.), \u00b631. Proposition 8 opponents\nalso allegedly harassed the measure\u2019s supporters by defacing or\ndamaging their property.Id., \u00b632. Two religious\norganizations supporting Proposition 8 reportedly received through\nthe mail envelopes containing a white powdery substance.Id., \u00b633.Those accounts are consistent with media\nreports describing Proposition 8-related retaliation. The director\nof the nonprofit California Musical Theater gave $1,000 to support\nthe initiative; he was forced to resign after artists complained to\nhis employer. Lott & Smith, Donor Disclosure Has Its Downsides,\nWall Street Journal, Dec. 26, 2008, p. A13. The director of the Los\nAngeles Film Festival was forced to resign after giving $1,500\nbecause opponents threatened to boycott and picket the next\nfestival.Ibid.And a woman who had managed her popular,\nfamily-owned restaurant for 26 years was forced to resign after she\ngave $100, because \u201cthrongs of [angry] protesters\u201d repeatedly\narrived at the restaurant and \u201cshout[ed] \u2018shame on you\u2019 at\ncustomers.\u201d Lopez, Prop. 8 Stance Upends Her Life, Los\u00a0Angeles\nTimes, Dec. 14, 2008, p. B1. The police even had to \u201carriv[e] in\nriot gear one night to quell the angry mob\u201d at the restaurant.Ibid.Some supporters of Proposition 8 engaged in similar\ntactics; one real estate businessman in San Diego who had donated\nto a group opposing Proposition 8 \u201creceived a letter from the Prop.\n8 Executive Committee threatening to publish his company\u2019s name if\nhe didn\u2019t also donate to the \u2018Yes on 8\u2019 campaign.\u201d Donor\nDisclosure,supra,at A13.The success of such intimidation tactics has\napparently spawned a cottage industry that uses forcibly disclosed\ndonor information topre-emptcitizens\u2019 exercise of their\nFirst Amendment rights. Before the 2008 Presidential election, a\n\u201cnewly formed nonprofit group \u2026 plann[ed] to confront donors to\nconservative groups, hoping to create a chilling effect that will\ndry up contributions.\u201d Luo, Group Plans Campaign Against G.O.P.\nDonors, N.\u00a0Y. Times, Aug. 8, 2008, p. A15. Its leader, \u201cwho\ndescribed his effort as \u2018going for the jugular,\u2019\u00a0\u201d detailed\nthe group\u2019s plan to send a \u201cwarning letter \u2026 alerting donors who\nmight be considering giving to right-wing groups to a variety of\npotential dangers, including legal trouble, public exposure and\nwatchdog groups digging through their lives.\u201dIbid.These instances of retaliation sufficiently\ndemonstrate why this Court should invalidate mandatory disclosure\nand reporting requirements. Butamicipresent evidence of\nyet another reason to do so\u2014the threat of retaliation fromelected officials. Asamici\u2019s submissions make\nclear, this threat extends far beyond a single ballot proposition\nin California. For example, a candidate challenging an incumbent\nstate attorney general reported that some members of the State\u2019s\nbusiness community feared donating to his campaign because they did\nnot want to cross the incumbent; in his words, \u201c\u00a0\u2018I go to so\nmany people and hear the same thing: \u201cI sure hope you beat [the\nincumbent], but I can\u2019t afford to have my name on your records. He\nmight come after me next.\u201d\u00a0\u2019\u00a0\u201d Strassel, Challenging\nSpitzerism at the Polls, Wall Street Journal, Aug. 1, 2008, p. A11.\nThe incumbent won reelection in 2008.My point is not to express any view on the\nmerits of the political controversies I describe. Rather, it is to\ndemonstrate\u2014using real-world, recent examples\u2014the fallacy in the\nCourt\u2019s conclusion that \u201c[d]isclaimer and disclosure requirements \u2026\nimpose no ceiling on campaign-related activities, and do not\nprevent anyone from speaking.\u201dAnte, at 51 (internal\nquotation marks and citations omitted). Of course they do.\nDisclaimer and disclosure requirements enable private citizens and\nelected officials to implement political strategiesspecifically calculatedto curtail campaign-related\nactivity and prevent the lawful, peaceful exercise of First\nAmendment rights.The Court nevertheless insists that as-applied\nchallenges to disclosure requirements will suffice to vindicate\nthose speech rights, as long as potential plaintiffs can \u201cshow a\nreasonable probability that disclosure \u2026 will subject them to\nthreats, harassment, or reprisals from either Government officials\nor private parties.\u201dAnte, at 52 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). But the Court\u2019s opinion itself proves the irony in this\ncompromise. In correctly explaining why it must address the facial\nconstitutionality of \u00a7203, seeante, at 5\u201320, the Court\nrecognizes that \u201c[t]he First Amendment does not permit laws that\nforce speakers to \u2026 seek declaratory rulings before discussing the\nmost salient political issues of our day,\u201dante, at 7;\nthat as-applied challenges to \u00a7203 \u201cwould require substantial\nlitigation over an extended time\u201d and result in an \u201cinterpretive\nprocess [that] itself would create an inevitable, pervasive, and\nserious risk of chilling protected speech pending the drawing of\nfine distinctions that, in the end, would themselves be\nquestionable,\u201dante, at 9\u201310; that \u201ca court would be\nremiss in performing its duties were it to accept an unsound\nprinciple merely to avoid the necessity of making a broader\nruling,\u201dante, at 12; and that avoiding a facial challenge\nto \u00a7203 \u201cwould prolong the substantial, nation-wide chilling\neffect\u201d that \u00a7203 causes,ante, at 16. This logic, of\ncourse, applies equally to as-applied challenges to \u00a7\u00a7201 and\n311.Irony aside, the Court\u2019s promise that\nas-applied challenges will adequately protect speech is a hollow\nassurance. Now more than ever, \u00a7\u00a7201 and 311 will chill protected\nspeech because\u2014as California voters can attest\u2014\u201cthe advent of the\nInternet\u201d enables \u201cprompt disclosure of expenditures,\u201d which\n\u201cprovide[s]\u201d political opponents \u201cwith the information needed\u201d to\nintimidate and retaliate against their foes.Ante, at 55.\nThus, \u201cdisclosure permits citizens \u2026 to react to the speech of\n[their political opponents] in a proper\u201d\u2014or undeniablyimproper\u2014\u201cway\u201d long before a plaintiff could prevail on an\nas-applied challenge.[Footnote\n2]Ibid.I cannot endorse a view of the First Amendment\nthat subjects citizens of this Nation to death threats, ruined\ncareers, damaged or defaced property, or pre-emptive and\nthreatening warning letters as the price for engaging in \u201ccore\npolitical speech, the \u2018primary object of First Amendment\nprotection.\u2019\u00a0\u201dMcConnell, 540 U. S., at 264 (Thomas,\nJ., concurring in part, concurring in judgment in part, and\ndissenting in part) (quotingNixonv.Shrink Missouri\nGovernment PAC,528 U. S. 377, 410\u2013411\n(2000) (Thomas, J., dissenting)). Accordingly, I respectfully\ndissent from the Court\u2019s judgment upholding BCRA \u00a7\u00a7201 and 311.Footnote 1BCRA imposes similar disclosure requirements.\nSee,e.g.,2 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7434(f)(2)(F) (\u201cEvery person\nwho makes a disbursement for the direct costs of producing and\nairing electioneering communications in an aggregate amount in\nexcess of $10,000 during any calendar year\u201d must disclose \u201cthe\nnames and addresses of all contributors who contributed an\naggregate amount of $1,000 or more to the person making the\ndisbursement\u201d).Footnote 2But cf.Hillv.Colorado,530 U.
