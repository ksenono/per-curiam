Several of its\nprovisions address what is often the crucial question in a remedial\naction: Who pays?Today\u2019s case involves \u00a7113(f\u00a0)(3)(B) of the\nAct,[1] which allows \u201c[a]\nperson who has resolved its liability to the United States or a\nState\u201d in a settlement to seek \u201ccontribution\u201d\u2014that is, money from\nanother responsible individual. The question is whether a party\nmust resolve a CERCLA-specific liability in order to trigger this\nright, or whether a broader array of settlements involving\nenvironmental liability will do. We hold that CERCLA contribution\nrequires resolution of a CERCLA-specific liability.IGuam and the United States are engaged in a\nlong-running dispute over the Ordot Dump, a \u201c\u00a0\u2018280-foot\nmountain of trash\u2019\u00a0\u201d near the center of the island. 950 F.3d\n104, 109 (CADC 2020). The Navy constructed the dump in the 1940s,\nand then allegedly deposited toxic military waste there for several\ndecades. The United States later ceded control of the site to Guam,\nwhich itself used the dump as a public landfill. But that did not\nend the Federal Government\u2019s involvement. In the late 20th century,\nthe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) determined that the dump\nposed an ecological hazard. After Guam allegedly failed to comply\nwith agency directives to remediate the site, the EPA sued under\nthe Clean Water Act, asserting that Guam was \u201c\u00a0\u2018discharging\npollutants .\u00a0.\u00a0. into waters of the United States without\nobtaining a permit.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIbid.That litigation ended in 2004, when Guam and the\nEPA entered into a consent decree. The decree required Guam, among\nother things, to pay a civil penalty and to close and cover the\ndump. Guam\u2019s compliance would, in turn, be \u201cin full settlement and\nsatisfaction of the civil judicial claims of the United States\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. as alleged in the Complaint\u201d\u2014that is, claims under\nthe Clean Water Act.Id.,at 116. But Guam was not\ncompletely free. As the agreement explained, \u201cthe United States\nd[id] not waive any rights or remedies available to it for any\nviolation by the Government of Guam of federal and territorial laws\nand regulations,\u201d \u201c[e]xcept as specifically provided [i]n [the\ndecree].\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 166a.Thirteen years later, it was Guam\u2019s turn to\nsue\u2014this time under CERCLA. According to Guam\u2019s complaint, the\nUnited States\u2019 earlier use of the dump exposed it to liability on\ntwo fronts. The first was a cost-recovery action under \u00a7107(a),\nwhich allows a State (or here, a Territory), to recover \u201call costs\nof [a] removal or remedial action\u201d from \u201cany person who at the time\nof disposal of any hazardous substance owned or operated any\nfacility at which such hazardous substances were disposed of.\u201d See\nalso \u00a7101(27). The second was a \u00a7113(f\u00a0) \u201ccontribution\u201d\naction. Under that provision, a \u201cperson who has resolved its\nliability to the United States .\u00a0.\u00a0. for some or all of a\nresponse action or for some or all of the costs of such action in\n[a\u00a0] settlement may seek contribution from any person who is\nnot [already] party to a [qualifying] settlement.\u201d\n\u00a7113(f\u00a0)(3)(B).Rather than increase Guam\u2019s odds of recovery,\nhowever, the second legal theory led to the dismissal of its\ncomplaint. According to the D.\u00a0C. Circuit, if a partycanassert a contribution claim under \u00a7113(f\u00a0), itcannotassert a cost-recovery claim under \u00a7107(a). See 950\nF.\u00a03d, at 111. The court then determined that Guam possessed a\ncontribution claim\u2014at least at one point\u2014because the remedial\nmeasures and conditional release in the Clean Water Act decree\nsufficiently \u201c\u00a0\u2018resolved Guam\u2019s liability\u2019\u00a0\u201d for the\ndump.Id.,at 114\u2013117 (brackets omitted). But because the\n2004 decree had triggered the since-expired 3-year statute of\nlimitations for contribution actions, Guam had no remedy at all.Id.,at 107, 117; see also \u00a7113(g)(3). We granted\ncertiorari. 592 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2021).IIGuam now attacks two links in this chain of\nreasoning: First, Guam retreats from its complaint and argues that\nitneverhad a viable contribution claim under\n\u00a7113(f\u00a0), leaving it free to pursue a cost-recovery action\nunder \u00a7107(a). The reason, argues Guam, is that a contribution\nclaim arises only if a settlement resolves liability under CERCLA,\nand not under some other law such as the Clean Water Act. Second,\nGuam contends that even if resolution of a non-CERCLA liability is\nenough, the decree did not adequately \u201cresolve\u201danysort of\nliability because Guam did not formally admit responsibility and\nbecause the agreement left Guam open to future enforcement\naction.We need only address the first point to decide\nthis case.[2] A settlement must\nresolve a CERCLA liability to trigger a contribution action under\n\u00a7113(f\u00a0)(3)(B).Our analysis focuses on the totality of\nsubsection 113(f\u00a0), which governs the scope of a\n\u201ccontribution\u201d claim under CERCLA. This subsection begins with an\nanchor provision\u2014entitled \u201ccontribution\u201d\u2014that allows \u201c[a]ny person\n[to] seek contribution from any other person who is liable or\npotentially liable under section [1]07(a) of [CERCLA], during or\nfollowing any civil action under section [1]06 of [CERCLA] or under\nsection [1]07(a) of [CERCLA].\u201d \u00a7113(f\u00a0)(1). It next describes\nhow parties can insulate themselves from contribution, explaining\nthat \u201c[a] person who has resolved its liability to the United\nStates or a State in an administrative or judicially approved\nsettlement shall not be liable for claims for contribution\nregarding matters addressed in the settlement.\u201d \u00a7113(f\u00a0)(2).\nAnd finally, it discusses the treatment of \u201c[p]ersons not party to\n[a] settlement.\u201d \u00a7113(f\u00a0)(3). Most relevant here, \u201c[a] person\nwho has resolved its liability to the United States .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nfor some or all of a response action or for some or all of the\ncosts of such action in an administrative or judicially approved\nsettlement may seek contribution from any person who is not party\nto a settlement referred to in [\u00a7113(f\u00a0)(2)].\u201d\n\u00a7113(f\u00a0)(3)(B).That this subsection centers on and is entitled\n\u201ccontribution\u201d is the first clue that it is concerned only with the\ndistribution of CERCLA liability. A contribution suit does not\nexist in a vacuum, but rather is a tool for apportioning the\nburdens of a predicate \u201ccommon liability\u201d among the responsible\nparties.United Statesv.Atlantic Research Corp.,551 U.S.\n128, 138\u2013139 (2007); see alsoNorthwest Airlines, Inc.v.Transport Workers,451 U.S.\n77, 86\u201387 (1981). The most obvious place to look for that\nthreshold liability is CERCLA\u2019s reticulated statutory matrix of\nenvironmental duties and liabilities. Cf.Burlington N. & S.\nF.\u00a0R.\u00a0Co.v.United States,556 U.S.\n599, 610 (2009) (\u201c[Section 107(a)(3)] liability may not extend\nbeyond the limits of the statute itself\u00a0\u201d). After all,\n\u201c[s]tatutes must \u2018be read as a whole,\u2019\u00a0\u201dAtlantic\nResearch, 551 U.\u00a0S., at 135\u2014an especially salient approach\nin this case given that CERCLA\u2019s very title reinforces that it is a\n\u201cComprehensive\u201d Act.Remaining within the bounds of CERCLA is also\nconsistent with the familiar principle that a federal contribution\naction is virtually always a creature of a specific statutory\nregime. SeeNorthwest Airlines, 451 U.\u00a0S., at 90\u201391,\n95\u201397 (noting a \u201cnarrow exception\u201d for admiralty cases). In fact,\nthere is no \u201cgeneral federal right to contribution\u201d whatsoever.Id.,at 96; cf.Middlesex County Sewerage Authorityv.National Sea Clammers Assn.,453 U.S.\n1, 13\u201315 (1981) (refusing to \u201cassum[e] that Congress intended\nto authorize by implication additional judicial remedies for\nprivate citizens suing under [two environmental statutes]\u201d). That\nmodest understanding is difficult to reconcile with the United\nStates\u2019 invitation to treat \u00a7113(f\u00a0)(3)(B) as a free-roving\ncontribution right for a host of environmental liabilities arising\nunder other laws.The interlocking language and structure of the\nrelevant text confirm this understanding. The provision at issue\nhere\u2014\u00a7113(f\u00a0)(3)(B)\u2014recognizes a statutory right to\ncontribution in the specific circumstance where a person \u201chas\nresolved its liability\u201d via \u201csettlement.\u201d But as explained above,\nthis entitlement to postsettlement contribution does not stand\nalone. On the contrary, \u00a7113(f\u00a0)(3)(B) exists within\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018the specific context\u2019\u00a0\u201d of subsection (f\u00a0), which\noutlines the broader workings of CERCLA contribution.Merit\nManagement Group, LPv.FTI Consulting, Inc., 583\nU.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2018) (slip op., at 11).This \u00a7113(f\u00a0) family of contribution\nprovisions anticipates a predicate CERCLA liability, especially\nwhen properly read in \u201csequenc[e]\u201d as \u201c\u00a0\u2018integral parts of a\nwhole.\u2019\u00a0\u201dNew Prime Inc.v.Oliveira, 586\nU.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2019) (slip op., at 4); see alsoCooper\nIndustries, Inc.v.Aviall Services, Inc.,543 U.S.\n157, 167 (2004) (looking to \u201cthe whole of \u00a7113\u201d). The\n\u00a7113(f\u00a0)(1) anchor provision is especially clear on this\npoint, allowing contribution \u201cduring or following any civil action\nunder \u00a7[1]06 of this title or under \u00a7[1]07 of this title.\u201d See alsoid., at 166 (\u201cThe natural meaning of [\u00a7113(f\u00a0)(1)] is\nthat contribution may only be sought .\u00a0.\u00a0. \u2018during or\nfollowing\u2019 a specified civil action\u201d). And though \u00a7\u00a7113(f\u00a0)(2)\nand 113(f\u00a0)(3) are not quite as explicit, their phrasing and\ncontext still presume that a CERCLA liability is necessary to\ntrigger contribution.Section 113(f\u00a0)(2), for example, explains\nthat a settlement by one party \u201cdoes not discharge any of the otherpotentially liable personsunless its terms so provide.\u201d\n(Emphasis added.) The highlighted phrase is a \u201cnatural referent\u201d to\nthe text of the anchor provision,United Statesv.Briggs, 592 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2020) (slip op., at 3),\nwhich creates a CERCLA-specific contribution right against \u201cany\nother person who is liable orpotentially liableunder\n\u00a7[1]07 of [CERCLA],\u201d \u00a7113(f\u00a0)(1) (emphasis added).Section 113(f\u00a0)(3)(B)\u2014the provision at\nissue here\u2014also has language that is best \u201cunderstood only with\nreference\u201d to the CERCLA regime.Atlantic Research, 551\nU.\u00a0S., at 135; see alsoSturgeonv.Frost, 577\nU.S. 424, 438 (2016). The provision\u2019s final clause explains that\ncontribution is available \u201cfrom any person who is not party to a\nsettlement referred to in [\u00a7113(f\u00a0)(2)].\u201d As discussed above,\n\u00a7113(f\u00a0)(2) in turn mirrors the \u00a7113(f\u00a0)(1) anchor\nprovision that requires a predicate CERCLA liability. Section\n113(f\u00a0)(3)(B)\u2019s opening clause separately ties itself to the\nCERCLA regime by permitting contribution after a party \u201chas\nresolved its liability .\u00a0.\u00a0. for some or all of aresponse actionor for some or all of the costs ofsuch\naction.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Not only does the anchor provision\nalso discuss allocation of \u201cresponse costs,\u201d \u00a7113(f\u00a0)(1), but\nthe phrase \u201cresponse action\u201d is a familiar CERCLA phrase that\nappears dozens of times throughout the Act.E.g.,\u00a7101 (12\nappearances); \u00a7107 (17 appearances).To be sure, as the Government points out,\nremedial measures that a party takes under another environmental\nstatute might resemble steps taken in a formal CERCLA \u201cresponse\naction.\u201d But relying on that functional overlap to reinterpret the\nphrase \u201cresolved its liability .\u00a0.\u00a0. for some or all of a\nresponse action\u201d to mean \u201csettled an environmental liability that\nmight have been actionable under CERCLA\u201d would stretch the statute\nbeyond Congress\u2019 actual language.Perhaps more important, the Government\u2019s\ninterpretation would place undue stress on the word \u201cresolve.\u201d This\nterm conveys certainty and finality. See Webster\u2019s Third New\nInternational Dictionary 1933 (1986) (\u201cmake clear or certain\u201d);\nAmerican Heritage Dictionary 1107 (1981) (\u201cremove or dispel\n(doubts); .\u00a0.\u00a0. bring to a conclusion\u201d).[3] It would be rather odd to say that a party\nhas \u201cresolved its liability\u201d if that party remains vulnerable to a\nCERCLA suit. All the more so given that it will not always be clear\nwhether the substance of a prior environmental settlement was\nsufficiently similar to a quasi-CERCLA \u201cresponse action.\u201d As even\nthe Government admits, \u201c\u00a0\u2018response action\u2019 is, indeed, a broad\nterm, [but] it is not an unlimited term [that covers] everything\nunder the sun.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 39\u201340; cf. 950 F.\u00a03d, at 116\n(comparing Guam\u2019s obligations under the Clean Water Act decree to\nCERCLA\u2019s \u201cdefinition of a \u2018remedial action\u2019\u00a0\u201d). Rather than\nrequiring parties and courts to estimate whether a prior settlement\nwas close enough to CERCLA, the far simpler approach is to ask\nwhether a settlement expressly discharged a CERCLA\nliability.[4]No more persuasive are the United States\u2019\nefforts to emphasize the differences among \u00a7113(f\u00a0)\u2019s\nprovisions. The Government observes that \u00a7113(f\u00a0)(3)(B)\u2014unlike\nthe \u00a7113(f\u00a0)(1) anchor provision\u2014does not expressly demand a\npredicate CERCLA action. That distinction, so the argument goes,\nimplies that a broader range of environmental liabilities can\ntrigger \u00a7113(f\u00a0)(3)(B). SeeRussellov.United\nStates,464 U.S.\n16, 23 (1983) (\u201c\u00a0\u2018[W]here Congress includes particular\nlanguage in one section of a statute but omits it in another\nsection of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress\nacts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or\nexclusion\u2019\u00a0\u201d). But this effort to tear \u00a7113(f\u00a0)(3)(B)\naway from its companions based on a negative implication falters in\nlight of the other strong textual links among them. SeeMarxv.General Revenue Corp.,568 U.S.\n371, 381 (2013);Entergy Corp.v.Riverkeeper,\nInc.,556 U.S.\n208, 222 (2009). Section 113(f\u00a0)(3)(B)\u2019s use of the\nfamiliar phrase \u201cresponse action,\u201d express cross-reference to\nanother CERCLA provision, and placement in the statutory scheme\nprevent us from so easily severing it from the larger Act.Similarly unavailing is the Government\u2019s theory\nthat a tightly unified interpretation of these provisions would\ncreate surplusage problems. The United States argues, for example,\nthat a reading of \u00a7113(f\u00a0)(3)(B) that does nothing more than\nallow a party to seek contribution after settling a CERCLA\nliability would be redundant with \u00a7113(f\u00a0)(1), which already\npermits contribution \u201cduring or following any civil action under\n[\u00a7\u00a7106 and 107].\u201d But there is legitimate reason for separate\nprovisions, even if both allow contribution only for a CERCLA\nliability. For example, \u00a7113(f\u00a0)(3)(B) specifies the\nconsequences of a particular type of resolution (i.e.,settlement), explaining that an \u201cadministrative or judicially\napproved settlement\u201d is sufficient and reinforcing that a\ncontribution claim will not extend to parties who have already\nsettled. This sort of belt-and-suspenders approach hardly compels\nan all-encompassing reading of \u00a7113(f\u00a0)(3)(B). Cf.Rimini\nStreet, Inc.v.Oracle USA, Inc., 586 U.\u00a0S. ___,\n___ (2019) (slip op., at 11) (\u201cWe have recognized that some\nredundancy is hardly unusual in statutes addressing costs\u201d\n(internal quotation marks omitted)). Rather than try \u201cto avoid\nsurplusage at all costs,\u201dAtlantic Research, 551 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 137, we interpret \u00a7113(f\u00a0)(3)(B) in light of its text and\nplace within a comprehensive statutory scheme.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*The most natural reading of\n\u00a7113(f\u00a0)(3)(B) is that a party may seek contribution under\nCERCLA only after settling a CERCLA-specific liability. We thus\nreverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case\nfor further proceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.Notes1For the sake of\nsimplicity, we cite CERCLA\u2019s provisions as they appear in the Act\nitself. The most relevant corresponding sections of Title 42 of the\nU. S. Code are \u00a79607 (\u00a7107 of CERCLA) and \u00a79613 (\u00a7113 of\nCERCLA).2Guam has not challenged\nother portions of the lower court\u2019s reasoning, so we express no\nopinion on them.3See also \u00a7113(f\u00a0)(2)\n(\u201cA person who hasresolved its liability[in a] settlementshall not be liablefor claims for contribution regarding\nmatters addressed in the settlement\u201d (emphasis added));United\nStatesv.Atlantic Research Corp.,551 U.S.\n128, 141 (2007) (\u201c[S]ettlement [under \u00a7113(f\u00a0)(2)] carries\nthe inherent benefit offinally resolving liabilityas to\nthe United States or a State\u201d (emphasis added)).4This straightforward\ninquiry has the additional \u201cbenefit\u201d of \u201cprovid[ing] clarity\u201d for\nthe 3-year statute of limitations.United Statesv.Briggs, 592 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2020) (slip op., at 4).
