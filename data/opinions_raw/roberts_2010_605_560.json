S. ____ (2010)SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESNO. 09-367BRIAN RUSSELL DOLAN, PETITIONERv.UNITED\nSTATESon writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the tenth circuit[June 14, 2010]Chief Justice Roberts, with whom\nJustice Stevens, Justice Scalia, and Justice Kennedy join,\ndissenting.The statute at issue in this case\nprovides that \u201c[i]f the victim\u2019s losses are not ascertainable [at\nleast] 10 days prior to sentencing, \u2026 the court shall set a date\nfor the final determination of the victim\u2019s losses, not to exceed\n90 days after sentencing.\u201d 18 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a73664(d)(5). Under the\nCourt\u2019s view, failing to meet the 90-day deadline has no\nconsequence whatever. The Court reads the statute as if it said\n\u201cthe court shall set a date for the final determination of the\nvictim\u2019s losses,at any timeafter sentencing.\u201d I\nrespectfully dissent.IIn the absence of \u00a73664(d)(5),\nany order of restitution must be imposed at sentencing, if it is to\nbe imposed at all. Restitution \u201cmay be imposed in addition to [a]\nsentence\u201d of probation, fine, or imprisonment only if it is\nauthorized under \u00a73556. See \u00a7\u00a73551(b)\u2013(c). Section 3556, in turn,\nauthorizes courts to order restitution \u201cin imposing a\nsentenceon a defendant\u201d (emphasis added), pursuant to yet\nother provisions requiring such orders to be made \u201cwhen\nsentencinga defendant,\u201d \u00a7\u00a73663(a)(1)(A), (c)(1), 3663A(a) (1)\n(emphasis added). The mandatory restitution provisions of \u00a73663A\n\u201capply in allsentencing proceedingsfor convictions of\u201d\ncertain crimes. \u00a73663A(c)(1) (emphasis added). And the court \u201cat\nthe time of sentencing\u201d must \u201cstate in open court the reasons for\nits imposition of the particular sentence\u201d\u2014including its reasons\nfor \u201cnot order[ing] restitution\u201d if it fails to do so.\n\u00a73553(c).These provisions authorize\nrestitution ordersatsentencing. They confer no authority\nto order restitutionaftersentencing has concluded. When\nCongress permits courts to impose criminal penalties at some timeotherthan sentencing, it does so explicitly. See,e.g.,\u00a73552(b) (provisional sentence during a study\nperiod); \u00a73582(d) (authorizing certain penalties \u201cin imposing a\nsentence \u2026 or at any time thereafter\u201d); \u00a73583(e) (permitting\nextension of supervised release); \u00a7\u00a74244(d)\u2013(e) (provisional\nsentencing for the mentally ill); see also Fed. Rules Crim. Proc.\n32.2(b)(2)(B), (4)(A) (presentencing forfeiture orders); cf.Coreyv.United States,375 U. S. 169(1963)\n(appeals from provisional and final sentences authorized by\nlaw).Once a sentence has been imposed, moreover, it\nis final, and the trial judge\u2019s authority to modify it is narrowly\ncircumscribed. We have stated that \u201cthe trial courts had no such\nauthority\u201d prior to the adoption of Rule 35,United Statesv.Addonizio,442 U. S. 178, 189, and\nn.\u00a016 (1979), and Congress has since revoked the broad\nauthority to correct illegal sentences originally set forth in that\nRule. See Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, Pub. L. 98\u2013473, \u00a7215(b),\n98 Stat. 2015\u20132016; see also Historical Notes on 1984 Amendments to\nRule 35, 18 U. S.\u00a0C.\u00a0A., p. 605 (2008). Today, an error\nmay be corrected by the trial court only if it is \u201cclear,\u201d and only\nwithin 14 days after the sentence is announced. Rules 35(a), (c).\nThe Rule of Criminal Procedure allowing extensions of time\nexpressly provides that \u201c[t]he court may not extend the time to\ntake any action under Rule 35, except as stated in that rule.\u201d Rule\n45(b)(2). This Court has reiterated that time limits made binding\nunder Rule 35 \u201cmay not be extended,\u201dAddonizio,supra,at 189, and that Rule 45(b)(2) creates \u201cinflexible\u201d\n\u201cclaim-processing rules,\u201dEberhartv.United\nStates,546 U.\nS. 12, 19 (2005) (per curiam).Thus, if the trial court fails to impose a\nmandatory term of imprisonment, see,e.g.,\u00a7924(c)(1)(A),\nor a mandatory fine, see,e.g.,21 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7844(a),\nor a mandatory order of restitution, see 18 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a73663A,\nthe Government cannot simply ask it to impose the correct sentence\nlater. If the error is clear, and raised within 14 days, it might\nbe corrected under Rule 35. Otherwise, the Government must appeal,\nand seek resentencing on remand. \u00a7\u00a73742(b)(1), (g).Section 3664(d)(5) is a limited exception to\nthese bedrock rules. It permits a trial court to go forward with\nsentencing while delaying any restitution order for up to 90 days.\nThis provision is meaningful precisely because restitution must\notherwise be ordered at sentencing, and because sentences are\notherwise final unless properly corrected. If trial courts had\npower to amend their sentences at any time, \u00a73664(d)(5) would be\nunnecessary.Here, however, the District Court failed to\nmake use of its limited authority under \u00a73664(d)(5). Dolan was\nsentenced on July 30, 2007. The court declined to order restitution\nat that time or to set a date for a future restitution order. App.\n35, 39\u201340; see alsoid.,at 49.[Footnote 1] The 90-day period elapsed on October 28. At\nno time did the Government seek timely relief, whether under Rule\n35 or by appeal. Cf.Corey,supra,at 174;Bermanv.United States,302 U. S. 211, 212\n(1937). Nor did it assert any claim that the deadline had been\nlawfully extended or equitably tolled, an issue that I agree is not\nbefore us, seeante,at 3, 11. But on April 24, 2008\u2014269\ndays after sentencing, and after Dolan had already been released\nfrom prison\u2014the District Court nonetheless ordered $104,649.78 in\nrestitution. App. to Pet. for Cert. 32a, 47a.I cannot see where that court obtained\nauthority to add additional terms to Dolan\u2019s sentence. That is the\nstep the Court misses when it searches for the \u201cremedy\u201d for a\nviolation of \u00a73664(d)(5).Ante,at 1. The rule is that a\ntrial court cannot alter a sentence after the time of sentencing.\nSection 3664(d)(5) is a limited exception to that rule. If the\nlimits are exceeded the exception does not apply, and the general\nrule takes over\u2014the sentence cannot be changed to add a restitution\nprovision. Section 3664(d)(5) is self-executing: It grants\nauthority subject to a deadline, and if the deadline is not met,\nthe authority is no longer available.The Court appears to reason that \u00a73664(d)(5)\nconfers the authority to add a restitution provision for at least\n90 days, and that once the camel\u2019s nose of some permitted delay\nsneaks under the tent, any further delay is permissible.Ante,at 3, 5. But that is not what \u00a73664(d)(5) says. It\nprovides 90 days for a final determination of the victims\u2019 losses,\nnot a free pass to impose restitution whenever the trial court gets\naround to it. The court had no more power to order restitution 269\ndays after sentencing than it did to order an additional term of\nimprisonment and send Dolan back to prison.IIATo avoid this conclusion, the\nCourt runs through a series of irrelevancies that cannot trump the\nclear statutory text. It notes, for example, that \u00a73663A provides\nthat \u201c\u00a0\u2018[n]otwithstanding anyotherprovision of law, when sentencing a defendant convicted of\n[a specified] offense \u2026\u00a0, the courtshallorder \u2026\nthat the defendant make restitution to the victim of the\noffense.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAnte,at 6 (quoting \u00a73663A(a)(1);\nemphasis in Court\u2019s opinion). But the issue before us iswhenrestitution should be ordered, so the language the\nCourt should underscore is \u201cwhen sentencing.\u201d This\nprovision plainly confers no power to actaftersentencing. Any such power attaches only by virtue of \u00a73663A(d),\nwhich incorporates the procedures of \u00a73664, including the limited\n90-day exception. See also \u00a73556 (\u201cThe procedures under section\n3664 shall apply to all orders of restitution under this\nsection\u201d).The Court puts greater emphasis\non its reading of the statute\u2019s purpose, namely to provide\nrestitution to victims of crime. Certainly that was a purpose\nCongress sought to promote. But \u201cno legislation pursues its\npurposes at all costs,\u201d and \u201cit frustrates rather than effectuates\nlegislative intent simplistically to assume thatwhateverfurthers the statute\u2019s primary objective must be the law.\u201dRodriguezv.United States,480 U. S. 522, 525\u2013526\n(1987) (per curiam).Congress had to balance against the interest\nin restitution the contrary interest in promptly determining the\ndefendant\u2019s sentence. The balance struck was clearly set forth in\nthe statute: determine the victim\u2019s losses by a date \u201cnot to exceed\n90 days after sentencing.\u201d \u00a73664(d)(5). Whether or not that limit\nwas \u201cprimarilydesigned to help victims of crime,\u201dante, at 7, it does not cease to be law when invoked by\ndefendants.Nor can the Court find any support in the\nsecond sentence of \u00a73664(d)(5). Seeante,at 14\u201315. That\nprovision addresses a distinct issue\u2014what to do about newly\ndiscovered losses\u2014and sets a higher \u201cgood cause\u201d standard. The fact\nthat Congress struck the balance between restitution and finality\ndifferently in that context does not justify overriding the balance\nit struck here.The Court also analogizes the 90-day limit to\nother provisions discussed in our precedents, most of which have\nnothing to do with the rights of criminal defendants (for whom\nprocedural protections are of heightened importance), let alone the\nfinality of criminal sentencing. The cited cases are said to\nestablish that an official\u2019s \u201cfailure to meet [a] deadline\u201d does\nnot always deprive that official of \u201cpower to act beyond it.\u201dRegions Hospitalv.Shalala,522 U. S. 448, 459,\nn.\u00a03 (1998). But the failure to comply with \u00a73664(d)(5) does\nnot deprive anyone of anything: The trial court never had the\ngeneral authority to alter sentences once imposed, in the way that\nthe administrative agencies in the cited cases were said to have\ngeneral regulatory authority. The trial court\u2019s authority to add a\nrestitution provision to an otherwise final sentence was conferred\nby the very provision that limited that authority. Section\n3664(d)(5) did not take away anything that might persist in the\nabsence of \u00a73664(d)(5).[Footnote\n2]Even more perplexing is the Court\u2019s suggestion\nthat references to the authority of trial courts necessarily\nimplicate questions of jurisdiction.Ante,at 14. To say\nthat a court lacks authority to order belated restitution does not\nuse \u201cauthority\u201d in a jurisdictional sense, seeArbaughv.Y\u00a0&\u00a0H Corp.,546 U. S. 500, 511\n(2006), but only in the same sense in which a court lacks\n\u201cauthority\u201d to impose a sentence above the statutory maximum. Such\naction is an error of law, reversible on appeal, but it is not\njurisdictional. As inUnited Student Aid Funds, Inc.v.Espinosa, 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 9),\ncompliance with \u00a73664(d)(5) is \u201cnot a limitation on the \u2026 court\u2019s\njurisdiction,\u201d but it is a statutory \u201cprecondition to obtaining a\n[particular] order.\u201d Here that condition was not satisfied.BIn the end, the Court does not\nappear to need \u00a73664(d)(5) at all. It instead suggests that we\nabandon the bedrock rules that sentences once imposed are final,\nand that the only exceptions are onesCongresschooses to\nallow (and Congress has allowed various ones). The Court instead\nproposes ajudicialpower to alter sentences, apparently\nat any time. But if a trial court can \u201cleave open, say, the amount\nof a fine,\u201dante,at 12, why not, say, the number of\nyears? Thus, after a defendant like Dolan has served his entire\nsentence\u2014and who knows how long after?\u2014a court might still order\nadditional imprisonment, additional restitution, an additional\nfine, or an additional condition of supervised release. Seeante,at 12\u201313.The Court cites no authority in\nsupport of such \u201cfill in th[e] blank\u201d sentencing, other than two\ncases implicated in the Circuit split below.Ante,at 13.\nPrior to the enactment of \u00a73664(d)(5), however, it was widely\nrecognized that the requirement to impose restitution \u201cwhen\nsentencing\u201d meant that \u201c[r]estitution must be determinedat the\ntimeof sentencing,\u201d and could not be left open after\nsentencing had concluded. Federal Judicial Center, J. Wood,\nGuideline Sentencing: An Outline of Appellate Case Law on Selected\nIssues, p. 300 (Sept. 2002) (emphasis added; citingUnited\nStatesv.Porter, 41 F.\u00a03d 68, 71 (CA2 1994);United Statesv.Ramilo, 986 F.\u00a02d 333,\n335\u2013336 (CA9 1993);United Statesv.Prendergast,\n979 F.\u00a02d 1289, 1293 (CA8 1992);United Statesv.Sasnett, 925 F.\u00a02d 392, 398\u2013399 (CA11 1991)).The Court finds Rule 35(a) inapplicable\nbecause the District Court was not \u201c\u00a0\u2018correct[ing]\u2019\u00a0\u201d a\nclear error in the sentence.Ante,at 14. True enough; but\nthat is why the Government shouldlose. The limitation of\nRule 35(a) to clear errors, corrected within 14 days of sentencing,\ndoes not leave trial courts free to makeotherchanges to\nsentences whenever they choose. Rule 35(a) only makes sense against\na background rule that trial courts cannot change sentences at\nwill.The same is true of \u00a73552(b), which empowers a\ncourt that does not wish to delay sentencing but \u201cdesires more\ninformation than is otherwise available to it\u201d to impose a\nprovisional sentence during a 120-day study period. That statute\nwould be largely unnecessary if a trial court could do the same by\norder.InAddonizio, 442 U. S., at 189, we\nthought it noncontroversial that a sentence once imposed is final,\nsubject to such exceptions as Congress has allowed. Contrary to the\nCourt\u2019s suggestion,ante,at 13, Dolan invoked that\nprinciple both here and below. See,e.g.,Brief for\nPetitioner 13, 15\u201318, 20, 29, 33, and n.\u00a014, 36, 48, and\nn.\u00a019; Reply Brief for Petitioner 1, 5\u20138; Appellant\u2019s Opening\nBrief in No. 08\u20132104 (CA10), pp.\u00a012\u201313 (citingUnited\nStatesv.Blackwell, 81 F.\u00a03d 945, 949 (CA10\n1996), for the proposition that a \u201cdistrict court does not have\ninherent authority to modify a sentence\u201d). That the Court finds it\nnecessary to question that principle\u2014indeed, to accuse this dissent\nof \u201ccreat[ing] th[e] rule,\u201dante,at 13\u2014highlights how\nmisguided its decision is.To counter the effects of its opinion and to\nrestore some semblance of finality to sentencing, the Court advises\ndefendants to seek mandamus\u2014a remedy we have described as \u201cdrastic\nand extraordinary,\u201d \u201creserved for really extraordinary causes,\u201d and\none of \u201cthe most potent weapons in the judicial arsenal.\u201dCheneyv.United States Dist. Court for D. C.,542 U. S. 367,\n380 (2004) (internal quotation marks omitted). What an odd\nprocedure the Court contemplates! A defendant, who should have\nreceived a harsher sentence, is to invoke the drastic and\nextraordinary remedy of mandamus, to make sure he gets it. That is\nnot how sentencing errors are corrected: If the trial court fails\nto order the appropriate sentence, the Government must appeal to\ncorrect it. It did not do so here, and that ends the case.Greenlawv.United States, 554 U. S. ___, ___\n(2008) (slip op., at 6).Moreover, the Court\u2019s mandamus remedy only\nhelps defendants who know they are in danger of an increased\nsentence. So the Court imposes another rule, namely that the trial\ncourt must explicitly \u201cleave open\u201d the precise sentence at the time\nof sentencing,ante,at 12, or must make clear, \u201cprior to\nthe deadline\u2019s expiration[,] that itwouldorder\nrestitution\u201d at some indeterminate time,ante,at 1\n(emphasis added). But what if the court does not make the crucial\nannouncement at sentencing, or \u201cprior to the deadline\u2019s\nexpiration\u201d? Are these judicially created deadlines to be taken\nmore seriously than those imposed by Congress? Or are we just back\nat the beginning, asking what the \u201cremedy\u201d should be for failing to\nmeet the relevant deadline?The Court\u2019s suggestion to require notice of\nintent to augment the sentence atsomefuture date may be\na good idea. But an even better one might be to set a particular\ndate\u2014say, 90 days after sentencing\u2014on which the parties could base\ntheir expectations. That was Congress\u2019s choice, and it should be\ngood enough for us.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*The District Court in this case\nfailed to order mandatory restitution in sentencing Dolan. That was\nwrong. But two wrongs do not make a right, and that mistake gave\nthe court no authority to amend Dolan\u2019s sentence later, beyond the\n90 days allowed to add a sentencing term requiring restitution.I am mindful of the fact that\nwhen a trial court blunders, the victims may suffer. Consequences\nlike that are the unavoidable result of having a system of rules.\nIf no one appeals a mistaken ruling on the amount of restitution\n(or whether restitution applies at all), finality will necessarily\nobstruct the victims\u2019 full recovery.It is up to Congress to balance the competing\ninterests in recovery and finality. Where\u2014as here\u2014it has done so\nclearly, the \u201cjudicial inquiry is complete.\u201dBarnhartv.Sigmon Coal Co.,534 U. S. 438, 462\n(2002) (internal quotation marks omitted).Footnote 1Whether that date must itself be set at\nsentencing is not before us. The order setting the date plainly\ncannot be entered 182 days after sentencing, as happened here. See\nApp. 3\u20134.Footnote 2United Statesv.Montalvo-Murillo,495 U. S. 711(1990), is\nequally inapposite: The statute in that case rested the lower\ncourt\u2019s authority on whether a bail hearing had been held at all\n(it had), whereas here the only statutory condition is whether the\nlosses were determined within 90 days of sentencing (they were\nnot).",
