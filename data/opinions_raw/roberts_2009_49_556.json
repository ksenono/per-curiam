VADEN, PETITIONERv.DISCOVER\nBANK et\u00a0al.on writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the fourth circuit[March 9, 2009]Chief Justice Roberts, with whom\nJustice Stevens, Justice Breyer, and Justice Alito join, concurring\nin part and dissenting in part.I agree with the Court that a\nfederal court asked to compel arbitration pursuant to \u00a74 of the\nFederal Arbitration Act should \u201clook through\u201d the dispute over\narbitrability in determining whether it has jurisdiction to grant\nthe requested relief. But look through to what? The statute\nprovides a clear and sensible answer: The court may consider the \u00a74\npetition if the court \u201cwould have\u201d jurisdiction over \u201cthe subject\nmatter of a suit arising out of the controversy between the\nparties.\u201d 9 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a74.The \u00a74 petition in this case explains that the\ncontroversy Discover seeks to arbitrate is whether \u201cDiscover Bank\ncharged illegal finance charges, interest and late fees.\u201d App. 30.\nDiscover contends in its petition that the resolution of this\ndispute is controlled by federal law\u2014specifically \u00a727(a) of the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA), 12 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71831d(a)\n(setting forth the interest rates a state-chartered, federally\ninsured bank may charge \u201cnotwithstanding any State constitution or\nstatute which is hereby preempted\u201d). Vaden agrees that the legality\nof Discover\u2019s charges and fees is governed by the FDIA.* A federal\ncourt therefore \u201cwould have jurisdiction \u2026 of the subject matter of\na suit arising out of the controversy\u201d Discover seeks to arbitrate.\nThat suit could be an action by Vaden asserting that the charges\nviolate the FDIA, or one by Discover seeking a declaratory judgment\nthat they do not.The majority is diverted off this\nstraightforward path by the fortuity that a complaint happens to\nhave been filed in this case. Instead of looking to the controversy\nthe \u00a74 petitioner seeks to arbitrate, the majority focuses on the\ncontroversy underlying that complaint, and asks whether \u201cthewholecontroversy,\u201d as reflected in \u201cthe parties\u2019\nstate-court filings,\u201d arises under federal law.Ante, at\n16 (emphasis added). Because that litigation was commenced as a\nstate-law debt-collection claim, the majority concludes there is no\n\u00a74 jurisdiction.This approach is contrary to the language of\n\u00a74, and sharply restricts the ability of federal courts to enforce\nagreements to arbitrate. The \u201ccontroversy\u201d to which \u00a74 refers is\nthe dispute alleged to be subject to arbitration. The \u00a74 petitioner\nmust set forth the nature of that dispute\u2014the one he seeks to\narbitrate\u2014in the \u00a74 petition seeking an order to compel\narbitration. Section 4 requires that the petitioner be \u201caggrieved\u201d\nby the other party\u2019s \u201cfailure, neglect, or refusal \u2026 to arbitrate\nunder a written agreement for arbitration\u201d; that language guides\nthe district court to the specific controversy the other party is\nunwilling to arbitrate.That is clear from the FAA\u2019s repeated and\nconsistent use of the term \u201ccontroversy\u201d to mean the specific\ndispute asserted to be subject to arbitration, not to some broader,\n\u201cfull flavor[ed]\u201d or \u201cfull-bodied\u201d notion of the disagreement\nbetween the parties.Ante, at 17, and n.\u00a016. In \u00a72,\nfor example, the \u201ccontroversy\u201d is the one \u201cto [be] settle[d] by\narbitration\u201d and the one \u201cto [be] submit[ted] to arbitration.\u201d 9 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a72. In \u00a710(a)(3), it is a ground for vacating an\narbitration award that the arbitrator refused to hear evidence\n\u201cpertinent and material to the controversy\u201d\u2014obviously the\n\u201ccontroversy\u201d subject to arbitration, or the arbitrator\u2019s refusal\nto consider the evidence would hardly be objectionable. In \u00a711(c),\nan award may be modified if \u201cimperfect in matter of form not\naffecting the merits of the controversy\u201d\u2014again, necessarily the\ncontroversy submitted to arbitration, and therefore the subject of\nthe award.There is no reason to suppose \u201ccontroversy\u201d\nmeant the controversy subject to arbitration everywhere else in the\nFAA, but something quite different in \u00a74. The issue is whether\nthere is jurisdiction to compel arbitration to resolve a\ncontroversy; why would the pertinent controversy for assessing\njurisdiction be anything other than the same one asserted to be\nsubject to arbitration?The majority looks instead to the controversy\nthe state-court litigation seeks to resolve. This produces the odd\nresult of defining \u201ccontroversy\u201d more broadly than the \u00a74 petition\nitself. Discover\u2019s petition does not seek to arbitrate its\nstate-law debt-collection claims, but rather Vaden\u2019s allegation\nthat the fees Discover has been charging her (and other members of\nher proposed class) violate the FDIA. See App. 30. The majority\ndoes not appear to question that there would be federal\njurisdiction over a suit arising out of the subject matter of that\ndispute. The majority finds no jurisdiction here, however, because\n\u201ca federal court could not entertain Discover\u2019s state-law\ndebt-collection claim.\u201dAnte, at 20, n.\u00a019. There is\nno jurisdiction to compel arbitration of a plainly federal\ncontroversy\u2014the FDIA dispute\u2014because there is no jurisdiction to\ncompel arbitration of the debt-collection dispute. But why Discover\nshould have to demonstrate federal jurisdiction over a state-court\nclaim it does not seek to arbitrate is a mystery. Cf.Moses H.\nCone Memorial Hospitalv.Mercury Constr. Corp.,460 U. S. 1, 19\u201321\n(1983) (affirming federal-court jurisdiction over a \u00a74 petition\nseeking to arbitrate only one of two disputes pending in\nstate-court litigation);Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.v.Byrd,470\nU. S. 213, 218\u2013221 (1985) (when litigation involves multiple\nclaims, only some of which are covered by an arbitration agreement,\ndistrict court must compel arbitration of the covered claims if so\nrequested).The majority\u2019s approach will allow federal\njurisdiction to compel arbitration ofentirelystate-law\nclaims. Under that approach the \u201ccontroversy\u201d is not the one the \u00a74\npetitioner seeks to arbitrate, but a broader one encompassing the\n\u201cwhole controversy\u201d between the parties.Ante, at 16. If\nthat broader dispute involves both federal and state-law claims,\nand the \u201coriginating\u201d dispute is federal,ibid., a party\ncould seek arbitration of just the state-law claims. The\n\u201ccontroversy\u201d under the majority\u2019s view would qualify as federal,\ngiving rise to \u00a74 jurisdiction to compel arbitration of a purely\nstate-law claim.Take this case as an example. If Vaden had\nfiled her FDIA claim first, and Discover had responded with a\nstate-law debt-collection counterclaim, that suit is one that\n\u201ccould be litigated in federal court.\u201dAnte, at 15. As a\nresult, the majority\u2019s approach would seem to permit Vaden to file\na \u00a74 petition to compel arbitration of the entirely state-law-based\ndebt-collection dispute, because that dispute would be part and\nparcel of the \u201cfull flavor[ed],\u201d \u201coriginating\u201d FDIA controversy.Ante, at 16, 17. Defining the controversy as the dispute\nthe \u00a74 petitioner seeks to arbitrate eliminates this problem by\nensuring that theactual disputesubject to arbitration is\nfederal.The majority\u2019s conclusion that this\ncontroversy \u201cis not one qualifying for federal-court adjudication,\u201dante, at 19, stems from its mistaken focus on the existing\nlitigation. Rather than ask whether a court \u201cwould have\u201d\njurisdiction over the \u201csubject matter\u201d of \u201ca\u201d suit arising out of\nthe \u201ccontroversy,\u201d the majority asks only whether the courtdoeshave jurisdiction over the subject matter of aparticularcomplaint. But \u00a74 does not speak of actual\njurisdiction over pending suits; it speaks subjunctively of\nprospective jurisdiction over \u201cthe subject matter of a suit arising\nout of the controversy between the parties.\u201d 9 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a74.\nThe fact that Vaden has chosen to package the FDIA controversy in\ncounterclaims in pending state-court litigation in no way means\nthat a district court \u201cwould [not] have\u201d jurisdiction over the\n\u201csubject matter\u201d of \u201ca suit\u201d arising out of the FDIA controversy. A\nbig part of arbitration is avoiding the procedural niceties of\nformal litigation; it would be odd to have the authority of a court\nto compel arbitration hinge on just such niceties in a pending\ncase.By focusing on the sequence in which\nstate-court litigation has unfolded, the majority crafts a rule\nthat produces inconsistent results. Because Discover\u2019s\ndebt-collection claim was filed before Vaden\u2019s counterclaims, the\nmajority treats the debt-collection dispute as the \u201coriginating\ncontroversy.\u201dAnte, at 16. But nothing would have\nprevented the same disagreements between the parties from producing\na different sequence of events. Vaden could have filed a complaint\nraising her FDIA claims before Discover sought to collect on any\namounts Vaden owes. Because the \u201coriginating controversy\u201d in that\ncomplaint would be whether Discover has charged fees illegal under\nfederal law, in that situation Discover presumablycouldbring a \u00a74 petition to compel arbitration of the FDIA dispute. The\nmajority\u2019s rule thus makes \u00a74 jurisdiction over the same\ncontroversy entirely dependent upon the happenstance of how\nstate-court litigation has unfolded. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nothing in\n\u00a74 suggests such a result.The majority glosses over another problem\ninherent in its approach: In many if not most cases under \u00a74, no\ncomplaint will have been filed. SeeHartford Financial Systems,\nInc.v.Florida Software Servs., Inc., 712 F.\u00a02d\n724, 728 (CA1 1983) (Breyer, J.) (\u201cNormally, [\u00a74] motions are\nbrought in independent proceedings\u201d). What to \u201clook through\u201d to\nthen? The majority instructs courts to look to the \u201cfull-bodied\ncontroversy.\u201dAnte, at 17, n.\u00a016. But as this case\nillustrates, that would lead to a different result had the\nstate-court complaint not been filed. Discover does not seek to\narbitrate whether an outstanding debt exists; indeed, Discover\u2019s \u00a74\npetition does not even allege any dispute on that point. See App.\n28\u201341. A district court would therefore not understand the \u00a74\n\u201ccontroversy\u201d to include the debt-collection claim in the absence\nof the state-court suit. Under the majority\u2019s rule, the FDIA\ndispute would be treated as a \u201ccontroversy\u201d qualifying under \u00a74\nbefore the state suit and counterclaims had been filed, but not\nafter.The far more concrete and administrable\napproach would be to apply the same rule in all instances: Look to\nthe controversy the \u00a74 petitioner seeks to arbitrate\u2014as set forth\nin the \u00a74 petition\u2014and assess whether a federal court would have\njurisdiction over the subject matter of a suit arising out of that\ncontroversy. The controversy the moving party seeks to arbitrate\nand the other party will not would be the same controversy used to\nassess jurisdiction to compel arbitration.The majority objects that this would allow a\ncourt to \u201chypothesiz[e] discrete controversies of its own design,\u201dante, at 16, in an apparent effort to find federal\njurisdiction where there is none. Not so. A district court\nentertaining a \u00a74 petition is required to determine what \u201ca suit\u201d\narising out of the allegedly arbitrable controversy would look\nlike. There is no helping that, given the statute\u2019s subjunctive\nlanguage. But that does not mean the inquiry is the free-form one\nthe majority posits.To the contrary, a district court must look to\nthe specific controversy\u2014the concrete dispute that one party has\n\u201cfail[ed], neglect[ed], or refus[ed]\u201d to arbitrate\u2014and determine\nwhetherthatcontroversy would give rise to a suit under\nfederal law. District courts do that sort of thing often enough;\nthe exercise is closely analogous to the jurisdictional analysis in\na typical declaratory judgment action. SeeFranchise Tax Bd. of\nCal.v.Construction Laborers Vacation Trust for Southern\nCal.,463 U. S.\n1, 19 (1983) (jurisdiction over a declaratory judgment action\nexists when, \u201cifthe declaratory judgment defendant\nbrought a coercive action to enforce its rights, that suit would\nnecessarily present a federal question\u201d (emphasis added)). Looking\nto the specific controversy outlined in Discover\u2019s \u00a74 petition\n(whether its fees violate the FDIA), it hardly requires\n\u201cdream[ing]\u201d to conceive of a lawsuit in which Vaden would claim\nthe FDIA has been violated and Discover would claim it has not.Ante, at 18.Nor would respondents\u2019 approach allow a \u00a74\npetitioner to simply \u201crecharacterize\u201d or \u201cmanufacture\u201d a\ncontroversy to create federal jurisdiction.Ante, at 17.\nAll of the established rules of federal jurisdiction are fully\napplicable in scrutinizing whether a federal court would have\njurisdiction over a suit arising out of the parties\u2019 underlying\ncontroversy.For example, a federal question must be\npresented by the specific controversy the \u00a74 petitioner seeks to\narbitrate, not by some hypothetical federal issue \u201clurking in the\nbackground.\u201dGullyv.First Nat. Bank in\nMeridian,299\nU. S. 109, 117 (1936). A district court could not compel\narbitration of a state-law dispute by pointing to a potential\nfederal defense that the \u00a74 petitioner is not seeking to arbitrate,\nbecause the \u201cclaim itself must present a federal question\u201d to arise\nunder federal law.Skelly Oil Co.v.Phillips\nPetroleum Co.,339 U. S. 667, 672\n(1950). Nor could a district court compel arbitration of a dispute\nthat, though not federal in character, could lead to the filing of\na federal counterclaim, for \u201ca counterclaim \u2026 cannot serve as the\nbasis for [federal] jurisdiction\u201d of the state-law dispute itself.Holmes Group, Inc.v.Vornado Air Circulation Systems,\nInc.,535 U. S.\n826, 831 (2002).Accordingly, petitioners may no more smuggle\nstate-law claims into federal court through \u00a74 than they can\nthrough declaratory judgment actions, or any other federal cause of\naction. To the extent \u00a74 brings some issues into federal court in a\nparticular case that may not be brought in through other procedural\nmechanisms, it does so by \u201cenlarg[ing] the range of remedies\navailable in the federal courts[,] \u2026 not extend[ing] their\njurisdiction.\u201dSkelly Oil,supra, at 671.That is why the majority\u2019s recital of the\nbasic rules of federal-court jurisdiction in Part II of its opinion\nis beside the point: No one disputes what those rules are, and no\none disputes that they must be followed under \u00a74 in deciding\nwhether a federal court \u201cwould have jurisdiction \u2026 of the subject\nmatter of a suit arising out of the controversy between the\nparties.\u201d The issue is insteadwhatsuit should be\nscrutinized for compliance with those rules. In defining\n\u201ccontroversy\u201d by reference to existing litigation, the majority\nartificially limits the reach of \u00a74 to the particular suit filed.\nThe correct approach is to accord \u00a74 the scope mandated by its\nlanguage and look to \u201ca suit,\u201d arising out of the \u201csubject matter\u201d\nof the \u201ccontroversy\u201d the \u00a74 petitioner seeks to arbitrate, and\ndetermine whether a federal court would have jurisdiction over such\na suit.The majority concludes by noting that state\ncourts are obliged to honor and enforce agreements to arbitrate.Ante, at 20. The question here, however, is one of remedy.\nIt is a common feature of our federal system that States often\nprovide remedies similar to those under federal law for the same\nwrongs. We do not, however, narrowly construe the federal\nremedies\u2014say federal antitrust or civil rights remedies\u2014because\nstate law provides remedies in those areas as well. Cf.Monroev.Pape,365 U. S. 167, 183\n(1961) (\u201cIt is no answer that the State has a law which if enforced\nwould give relief\u201d).*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*Discover and Vaden have agreed to\narbitrate any dispute arising out of Vaden\u2019s account with Discover.\nVaden\u2019s allegations against Discover have given rise to such a\ndispute. Discover seeks to arbitrate that controversy, but Vaden\nrefuses to do so. Resolution of the controversy is governed by\nfederal law, specifically the FDIA. There is no dispute about that.\nIn the absence of the arbitration agreement, a federal court \u201cwould\nhave jurisdiction \u2026 of the subject matter of a suit arising out of\nthe controversy between the parties,\u201d 9 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a74, whether\nthe suit were brought by Vaden or Discover. The District Court\ntherefore may exercise jurisdiction over this petition under \u00a74 of\nthe Federal Arbitration Act.*\u00a0Vaden has conceded that the FDIA completely\npre-empts her state-law counterclaims. See 489 F.\u00a03d 594, 604,\nn.\u00a010 (CA4 2007). What is significant about that concession is\nnot Vaden\u2019s agreement on the jurisdictional question of complete\npre-emption (which we need not and do not address), cf.ante, at 19, but rather her agreement that federal law\u2014the\nFDIA\u2014governs her allegation that Discover\u2019s charges and fees are\nillegal.",
