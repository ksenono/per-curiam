    "text": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES_________________No. 16\u20139493_________________FLORENCIO ROSALES-MIRELES, PETITIONERv.UNITED STATESon writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the fifth circuit[June 18, 2018]Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Alito joins,\ndissenting.The Court holds that, \u201cin the ordinary case,\u201d a\nmiscalculation of the advisory Sentencing Guidelines range will\n\u201cseriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of\njudicial proceedings.\u201dAnte,at 1. In other words, a\ndefendant who does not alert the district court to a plain\nmiscalculation of his Guidelines range\u2014and is not happy with the\nsentence he receives\u2014can raise the Guidelines error for the first\ntime on appeal and ordinarily get another shot at a more favorable\nsentence. The Court\u2019s decision goes far beyond what was necessary\nto answer the question presented.[1] And it contravenes long-established principles of\nplain-error review. I respectfully dissent.IUnder Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure\n52(b), \u201c[a] plain error that affects substantial rightsmaybe considered even though it was not brought to the court\u2019s\nattention.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The \u201cpoint of the plain-error rule\u201d\nis to \u201crequir[e] defense counsel to be on his toes.\u201dUnited\nStatesv.Vonn, 535 U.\u00a0S. 55, 73 (2002). Its\ndemanding standard is meant to \u201cencourage timely objections and\nreduce wasteful reversals by demanding strenuous exertion to get\nrelief for unpreserved error.\u201dUnited Statesv.Dominguez\nBenitez, 542 U.\u00a0S. 74, 82 (2004). If the standard were not\nstringent, there would be nothing \u201cprevent[ing] a litigant from\n\u2018\u00a0\u201csandbagging\u201d\u00a0\u2019 the court\u2014remaining silent about his\nobjection and belatedly raising the error only if the case does not\nconclude in his favor.\u201dPuckettv.United States, 556\nU.\u00a0S. 129, 134 (2009). Satisfying the plain-error standard \u201cis\ndifficult, \u2018as it should be.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId., at 135.This Court has held that Rule 52(b) is satisfied\nonly when four requirements are met: \u201c(1)\u00a0there is \u2018an error,\u2019\n(2)\u00a0the error is \u2018plain,\u2019\u00a0\u201d \u201c(3)\u00a0the error\n\u2018affect[s] substantial rights,\u2019\u00a0\u201d and\n\u201c(4)\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. \u2018the error \u201cseriously affect[s] the\nfairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial\nproceedings.\u201d\u00a0\u2019\u00a0\u201dHendersonv.United\nStates, 568 U.\u00a0S. 266, 272 (2013). The fourth\nrequirement\u2014the one at issue here\u2014is discretionary.Ibid.It\nshould \u201cbe applied on a case-specific and fact-intensive basis.\u201dPuckett,supra, at 142. And it cannot be satisfied by\n\u201ca plain error affecting substantial rights .\u00a0.\u00a0. ,\nwithout more, .\u00a0.\u00a0. for otherwise the discretion afforded\nby Rule 52(b) would be illusory.\u201dUnited Statesv.Olano, 507 U.\u00a0S. 725, 737 (1993). Instead, \u201conly\n\u2018particularly egregious errors\u2019\u00a0\u201d will meet the fourth prong\u2019s\nrigorous standard.United Statesv.Young, 470\nU.\u00a0S. 1, 15 (1985) (quotingUnited Statesv.Frady, 456 U.\u00a0S. 152, 163 (1982)); see alsoUnited\nStatesv.Atkinson, 297 U.\u00a0S. 157, 160 (1936)\n(explaining that courts should provide relief under plain-error\nreview only in \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d).IIThe Court holds that Guidelines errors will\n\u201cordinar[ily]\u201d satisfy the fourth prong of plain-error review.Ante,at 15. This result contravenes several established\nprinciples from our precedents.To begin, the Court\u2019s decision is at odds with\nthe principle that the fourth prong of plain-error review \u201cbe\napplied on a case-specific and fact-intensive basis.\u201dPuckett,supra, at 142. By holding that a Guidelines\nerror \u201cordinarily will satisfy [the] fourth prong\u201d absent\n\u201ccountervailing factors,\u201dante,at 11, the Court creates\nwhat is essentially a rebuttable presumption that plain Guidelines\nerrors satisfy Rule 52(b). And, based on the Court\u2019s application of\nit today, this presumption certainly must be difficult to rebut.\nThe Court matter-of-factly asserts, in a single sentence with no\nanalysis, that \u201cthere are no [countervailing] factors\u201d in this case\nthat counsel in favor of affirmance.Ante,at 11. It does so\nwithout even discussing the particular details of the defendant\u2019s\ncrime, what happened at his sentencing, the reasoning that the\nDistrict Court employed, the difference between the defendant\u2019s\ncalculated Guidelines range and the correct one, or where his\nsentence fell relative to the correct Guidelines range. This\napproach is neither \u201ccase-specific\u201d nor \u201cfact-intensive.\u201dPuckett,supra, at 142. The Court candidly admits as\nmuch. Seeante,at 11, n.\u00a04. But this is exactly the\nkind of \u201c\u00a0\u2018per\u00a0seapproach to plain-error\nreview\u2019\u00a0\u201d that we have consistently rejected.Puckett,supra, at 142.The Court\u2019s rebuttable presumption also renders\nthe fourth prong of plain-error review \u201cillusory\u201d in most\nGuidelines cases.Olano,supra, at 737. The Court\nexpressly states that Guidelines errors will satisfy the fourth\nprong in \u201cthe ordinary case.\u201dAnte,at 15. But this Court\nhas repeatedly held that the fourth prong limits courts\u2019 discretion\nto \u201ccorrect[ing] only \u2018particularly egregious errors.\u2019\u00a0\u201dYoung,supra, at 15. Because Rule 52(b) \u201c\u00a0\u2018is\nnot a run-of-the-mill remedy,\u2019\u00a0\u201dFrady,supra,\nat 163, n.\u00a014, relief should be granted \u201csparingly\u201d in\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018the rare case,\u2019\u00a0\u201dJonesv.United\nStates, 527 U.\u00a0S. 373, 389 (1999), and only in\n\u201cexceptional circumstances,\u201dAtkinson,supra, at 160.\nToday\u2019s decision turns that principle on its head by making relief\navailable \u201cin the ordinary case.\u201dAnte,at 1.The Court asserts that relief under plain-error\nreview need not be exceptional or rare when a remand would not\nrequire \u201cadditional jury proceedings.\u201dAnte,at 12. But that\ndistinction has no basis in the text of Rule 52(b) or this Court\u2019s\nprecedents. The only Rule 52(b) precedent that the Court cites for\nthis assertion isMolina-Martinezv.United States,\n578 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 15). Seeante,at 9. That decision rejected the Fifth Circuit\u2019s categorical rule\nrequiring defendants to present \u201cadditional evidence\u201d (beyond the\nGuidelines error itself) to prove prejudice under the third prong\nof plain-error review. See 578 U.\u00a0S., at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at\n8\u20139). In dicta it suggested that, \u201cin the ordinary case,\u201d the\nGuidelines error would be enough to satisfy the third prong\u2019s\nrequirement that the error affect substantial rights.Id.,\nat ___ (slip op., at 15). And it rebuffed the Government\u2019s\npragmatic \u201cconcern over the judicial resources needed\u201d if\nGuidelines errors usually satisfy the third prong of plain-error\nreview.Id., at ___ (slip op., at 14). ButMolina-Martinezdid not discuss the fourth prong of\nplain-error review, which is at issue here and is an independent\nrequirement, seeOlano,supra, at 737. Nor did it\nrelax the plain-error standard whenever reversal would not require\n\u201cadditional jury proceedings.\u201dAnte,at 12. Thus,Molina-Martinezgives no support to the Court\u2019s\ninnovation.Additionally, the Court\u2019s encouragement of\nremands based on ordinary Guidelines errors undermines \u201cthe\npolicies that underpin Rule 52(b).\u201dDominguez Benitez, 542\nU.\u00a0S., at 82. As explained, the plain-error standard\nencourages defendants to make timely objections in order to avoid\nsandbagging and to prevent wasteful reversals and remands. After\ntoday, however, most defendants who fail to object to a Guidelines\nerror will be in virtually the same position as those who do.\nToday\u2019s decision, especially when combined withMolina-Martinez, means that plain Guidelines errors will\nsatisfy Rule 52(b) in all but the unusual case. That creates the\nvery opportunity for \u201csandbagging\u201d that Rule 52(b) is supposed to\nprevent,Puckett, 556 U.\u00a0S., at 134 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted), by allowing a defendant who is aware of a mistake\nin the presentence report to \u201csimply relax and wait to see if the\nsentence later str[ikes] him as satisfactory,\u201dVonn, 535\nU.\u00a0S., at 73. Oddly, defendants who do not object to a\nGuidelines error could be in a better position than ones who do. An\nobjection would give the district court a chance to explain why it\nwould \u201carrive at the same sentencing conclusion\u201d even if the\ndefendant was correct about an alleged Guidelines error, which\nwould \u201cmak[e] clear\u201d that the Guidelines error did not \u201cadversely\naffect the defendant\u2019s ultimate sentence.\u201dUnited Statesv.Sabillon-Umana, 772 F.\u00a03d 1328, 1334 (CA10 2014).\nToday\u2019s decision thus inverts Rule 52(b) by giving defendants an\nincentive to withhold timely objections and \u201c\u00a0\u2018game\u2019 the\nsystem.\u201dPuckett,supra, at 140.IIIEven if it were appropriate to create\nrebuttable presumptions under the fourth prong of plain-error\nreview, the Court is wrong to conclude that the \u201cordinary\u201d\nGuidelines error will \u201cseriously affect the fairness, integrity, or\npublic reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201dAnte,at 1.\nWhether a district court\u2019s failure to correctly calculate the\nadvisory Guidelines range satisfies the fourth prong of plain-error\nreview will depend on the circumstances of each case. And the\ncircumstances of this case prove the folly of the Court\u2019s\npresumption.AThe Court asserts that plain Guidelines errors\nmust ordinarily be corrected to ensure that defendants do not\n\u201clinger longer in federal prison than the law demands.\u201dAnte,at 10 (internal quotation marks omitted). But the\nGuidelines are not \u201claw.\u201d They neither \u201cdefine criminal offenses\u201d\nnor \u201cfix the permissible sentences for criminal offenses.\u201dBecklesv.United States, 580 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___\n(2017) (slip op., at 5) (emphasis deleted). Instead, they are\npurely \u201cadvisory\u201d and \u201cmerely guide the district courts\u2019\ndiscretion.\u201dId.,at ___ (slip op., at 8). They provide\nadvice about what sentencing range the Sentencing Commission\nbelieves is appropriate, \u201cbut they \u2018do not constrain\u2019\u00a0\u201d\ndistrict courts.Ibid.Accordingly, district courts are free\nto disagree with the Guidelines range, for reasons as simple as a\npolicy disagreement with the Sentencing Commission. SeePepperv.United States, 562 U.\u00a0S. 476, 501\n(2011); 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73661. In fact, district courts\ncommit reversible error if they \u201ctrea[t] the Guidelines as\nmandatory.\u201dGallv.United States, 552 U.\u00a0S. 38,\n51 (2007). Although the Guidelines range is one of the factors that\ncourts must consider at sentencing, 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73553(a),\njudges need not give the Guidelines range any particular weight.\nThe only thing that \u201cthe law demands\u201d is that a defendant\u2019s\nsentence be substantively reasonable and within the applicable\nstatutory range. SeeJonesv.United States, 577\nU.\u00a0S. ___, ___\u2013___ (2015) (Scalia, J., dissenting from denial\nof certiorari) (slip op., at 1\u20132);Kimbroughv.United\nStates, 552 U.\u00a0S. 85, 113\u2013114 (2007) (Scalia, J.,\nconcurring).The Court also justifies its presumption by\nrepeatedly stressing the importance of procedural rules to the\npublic\u2019s perception of judicial proceedings. Seeante,at 10\n(\u201c[T]he public legitimacy of our justice system relies on\nprocedures\u201d);ante,at 13 (\u201c[U]njust procedures may well\nundermine public perception of [sentencing] proceedings\u201d). It even\ncites a hodgepodge of psychological studies on procedural justice.Ante, at 13 (citing Hollander-Blumoff, The Psychology of\nProcedural Justice in the Federal Courts, 63 Hastings L.\u00a0J.\n127, 132\u2013134 (2011) (Hollander-Blumoff)).Putting aside the obvious problems with this\nresearch,[2] the Court\ncontradicts our precedents by suggesting that adhering to procedure\nhas prime importance for purposes of the fourth prong. This Court\nhas repeatedly concluded that purely procedural errors\u2014ones that\nlikely did not affect the substantive outcome\u2014do not satisfy the\nfourth prong of plain-error review. InJohnsonv.United\nStates, 520 U.\u00a0S. 461 (1997), for example, the District\nCourt failed to submit a materiality element to the jury, but this\nCourt found that the fourth prong of plain-error review was notsatisfied because \u201cthe evidence supporting\nmateriality was \u2018overwhelming.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId.,at 470. Reversal\nbased on errors that have no actual \u201c\u00a0\u2018effect on the\njudgment,\u2019\u00a0\u201d this Court explained, \u201c\u00a0\u2018encourages\nlitigants to abuse the judicial process and bestirs the public to\nridicule it.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIbid.(quoting R. Traynor, The Riddle\nof Harmless Error 50 (1970)). Similarly, inUnited Statesv.Cotton, 535 U.\u00a0S. 624 (2002), the indictment failed to\nallege a fact that increased the statutory maximum, but the\nevidence of that fact \u201cwas \u2018overwhelming\u2019 and \u2018essentially\nuncontroverted.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId.,at 633. This Court held that\nreversing a defendant\u2019s sentence based on such a technicality would\nbe \u201c[t]he real threat .\u00a0.\u00a0. to the \u2018fairness, integrity,\nand public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId.,at 634. And inUnited Statesv.Marcus, 560\nU.\u00a0S. 258 (2010), the Second Circuit had held that anex\npost factoerror automatically satisfies the plain-error\nstandard, \u201c\u00a0\u2018no matter how unlikely\u2019\u00a0\u201d it was that the\njury actually convicted the defendant based on conduct that\npredated the statute of conviction.Id.,at 261 (emphasis\ndeleted). In reversing that decision, this Court emphasized that,\n\u201cin most circumstances, an error that does not affect the jury\u2019s\nverdict does not significantly impugn the \u2018fairness,\u2019 \u2018integrity,\u2019\nor \u2018public reputation\u2019 of the judicial process.\u201dId.,at\n265\u2013266. Thus, the Court is mistaken when it asserts that, because\nGuidelines errors are procedural mistakes, they are particularly\nlikely to implicate the fourth prong of plain error.BWhile the Court holds that the ordinary\nGuidelines error will satisfy the fourth prong of plain-error\nreview, it admits that there can be \u201cinstances where countervailing\nfactors\u201d preclude defendants from satisfying the fourth prong.Ante,at 11. Because the Court does not question our\nexisting plain-error precedents, seeante,at 12, the burden\npresumably remains on defendants to establish that there are no\nsuch countervailing factors, and to persuade the appellate court\nthat any countervailing factor identified by the Government is\ninsufficient. SeeVonn, 535 U.\u00a0S., at 63 (\u201c[A]\ndefendant has the further burden to persuade the court that the\nerror seriously affect[ed] the fairness, integrity or public\nreputation of judicial proceedings\u201d (internal quotation marks\nomitted));Dominguez Benitez, 542 U.\u00a0S., at 82 (\u201c[T]he\nburden of establishing entitlement to relief for plain error is on\nthe defendant claiming it\u201d). But the Court does not explain what\nthe defendant in this case has done to satisfy his burden.If this case is an ordinary one, it highlights\nthe folly of the Court\u2019s new rebuttable presumption. Petitioner\nFlorencio Rosales-Mireles has a penchant for entering this country\nillegally and committing violent crimes\u2014especially against women. A\nMexican citizen, Rosales-Mireles entered the United States\nillegally in 1997. In 2002, he was convicted of assault for\nthrowing his girlfriend to the floor of their apartment and\ndragging her outside by her hair. In 2009, he was convicted of\naggravated assault with serious bodily injury and assault causing\nbodily injury to a family member.[3] His convictions stemmed from an altercation in which he\nattempted to stab one man and did stab another\u2014once in the shoulder\nand twice in the chest. In January 2010, Rosales-Morales was\nremoved to Mexico. But that same month he reentered the United\nStates illegally. In 2015, he was convicted in Texas state court of\nassaulting his wife and 14-year-old son. During the altercation,\nRosales-Mireles grabbed his wife by the hair and punched her in the\nface repeatedly.Most recently, Rosales-Mireles pleaded guilty to\nillegal reentry. See 8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a71326(a), (b)(2). The\nDistrict Court sentenced him to 78 months in prison, which was\nwithin the Guidelines range he argued for on appeal. Seeante,at 4. In choosing that sentence, the District Court\nemphasized that it was \u201cthe second time he\u2019s come to the courts for\nbeing here illegally\u201d; that he had \u201cattempted to hide in the United\nStates with multiple aliases, birth dates, [and] Social Security\nnumbers\u201d; and that his \u201cassaultive behavior\u201d spanned from \u201cat least\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. 2001 to 2015.\u201d App. 20.The sentence that Rosales-Mireles received was\nnot only within both the improperly and properly calculated\nGuidelines ranges but also in the bottom half of both possible\nranges. Seeante,at 4. If the District Court had used the\nproper Guidelines range at his initial sentencing, then the\nsentence that it ultimately gave Rosales-Mireles would have been\npresumptively reasonable on appeal. See 850 F.\u00a03d 246, 250\n(CA5 2017);Ritav.United States, 551 U.\u00a0S.\n338, 347 (2007). And the Fifth Circuit determined that his sentence\nwas in fact reasonable. See 850 F.\u00a03d, at 250\u2013251. Leaving\nthat reasonable sentence in place would not \u201c\u00a0\u2018seriously\naffect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial\nproceedings.\u2019\u00a0\u201dYoung, 470 U.\u00a0S., at 15. A\nsentence that is substantively reasonable is hardly the kind of\n\u201cparticularly egregious erro[r]\u201d that warrants plain-error relief.Frady, 456 U.\u00a0S., at 163.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*Rule 52(b) strikes a \u201ccareful balance\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. between judicial efficiency and the redress of\ninjustice.\u201dPuckett, 556 U.\u00a0S., at 135. Because today\u2019s\ndecision upsets that balance for scores of cases involving\nGuidelines errors, I respectfully dissent.Notes1We granted certiorari to\ndecide whether \u201cthe fourth prong of plain error review [demands],\nas the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals required, that the error be\none that \u2018would shock the conscience of the common man, serve as a\npowerful indictment against our system of justice, or seriously\ncall into question the competence or integrity of the district\njudge.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Pet. for Cert. i; 582 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2017).\nAlthough I doubt it changed the outcome in any case, I agree that\nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s standard is higher than the one articulated in\nthis Court\u2019s precedents\u2014at least to the extent it requires an\nuncorrected error to \u201cshock the conscience.\u201d Seeante,at\n5\u20137.2The article that the\nCourt cites makes broad claims based on limited research. For\ninstance, the article states that, \u201c[w]hen people feel that they\nhave received fair treatment, they are more likely to adhere to,\naccept, and feel satisfied with a given outcome, and to view the\nsystem that gave rise to that outcome as legitimate.\u201d\nHollander-Blumoff, 134. But the only support it provides for that\nproposition is a telephone survey of a few hundred Chicago\nresidents. Seeid.,at 134, n. 37 (citing T. Tyler, Why\nPeople Obey the Law 162 (2006)); see alsoid.,at 8\u201315\n(explaining the study\u2019s methodology). The article also draws\nconclusions about the general importance of \u201cprocedural justice\u201d in\ncourt, based on marginally relevant studies of noncourt settings\nsuch as \u201carbitration and mediation,\u201d interactions with \u201cpolice\nofficers\u201d and \u201cwork supervisors,\u201d and \u201chighly relational settings\nlike the family.\u201d See Hollander-Blumoff 132\u2013134. Crucially, none of\nthis research has any bearing on the far more complicated question\nof \u201cprocedural justice\u201d at issue here: whether it is presumptively\nunfair to penalize a defendant who fails to object to an error\nuntil appeal. The contemporaneous-objection rule, after all, is\nalso a procedural rule that affects the fairness, integrity, and\nreputation of judicial proceedings.3These assaults occurred\nin 2001, but Rosales-Mireles was not arrested for years\u2014apparently\nbecause he was going by the name \u201cEmilio Ruiz\u201d at the time of the\nassaults. When Rosales-Mireles was eventually arrested in 2009, he\nhad two outstanding warrants for other assaults of his\nwife.",
