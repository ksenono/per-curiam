SANCHEZ VALLE, et\u00a0al.on writ of certiorari to the supreme court of\npuerto rico[June 9, 2016]Justice Thomas, concurring in part and\nconcurring in the judgment.The Court today concludes that the Commonwealth\nof Puerto Rico and the United States are not separate sovereigns\nbecause the Federal Government is the ultimate source of Puerto\nRico\u2019s authority to prosecute crimes.Ante, at 16. I agree\nwith that holding, which hews to the Court\u2019s precedents concerning\nthe Double Jeopardy Clause and U.\u00a0S. Territories. But I\ncontinue to have concerns about our precedents regarding Indian\nlaw, seeUnitedStatesv.Lara, 541 U.\u00a0S.\n193 \u2013226 (2004) (opinion concurring in judgment), and I cannot join\nthe portions of the opinion concerning the application of the\nDouble Jeopardy Clause to successive prosecutions involving Indian\ntribes. Aside from this caveat, I join the Court\u2019s opinion.",
