He acknowledges that the U.\u00a0S. Constitution permits a\nsentence of execution for his crimes. He accepts, too, that the\nState\u2019s lethal injection protocol is constitutional in most\napplications. But because of his unusual medical condition, he\ncontends the protocol is unconstitutional as applied to him. Mr.\nBucklew raised this claim for the first time less than two weeks\nbefore his scheduled execution. He received a stay of execution and\nfive years to pursue the argument, but in the end neither the\ndistrict court nor the Eighth Circuit found it supported by the law\nor evidence. Now, Mr. Bucklew asks us to overturn those judgments.\nWe can discern no lawful basis for doing so.IAIn 1996, when Stephanie Ray announced that she\nwanted to end their relationship, Mr. Bucklew grew violent. He cut\nher jaw, punched her in the face, and threatened her with a knife.\nFrightened to remain in the home they had shared, Ms. Ray sought\nrefuge with her children in Michael Sanders\u2019 nearby residence. But\nthen one night Mr. Bucklew invaded that home. Bearing a pistol in\neach hand, he shot Mr. Sanders in the chest; fired at Mr. Sanders\u2019\n6-year-old son (thankfully, he missed); and pistol-whipped Ms. Ray,\nthis time breaking her jaw. Then Mr. Bucklew handcuffed Ms. Ray,\ndrove her to a secluded spot, and raped her at gunpoint. After a\ntrooper spotted Mr. Bucklew, a shootout followed and he was finally\narrested. While all this played out, Mr. Sanders bled to death. As\na coda, Mr. Bucklew escaped from jail while awaiting trial and\nattacked Ms. Ray\u2019s mother with a hammer before he could be\nrecaptured.After a decade of litigation, Mr. Bucklew was\nseemingly out of legal options. A jury had convicted him of murder\nand other crimes and recommended a death sentence, which the court\nhad imposed. His direct appeal had proved unsuccessful.Statev.Bucklew,973 S.W.2d 83(Mo. 1998), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 1082 (1999).\nSeparate rounds of state and federal post-conviction proceedings\nalso had failed to yield relief.Bucklewv.State,38 S.W.3d 395(Mo.), cert. denied, 534 U.S. 964 (2001);Bucklewv.Luebbers,436 F.3d 1010(CA8), cert. denied, 549 U.S. 1079 (2006).BAs it turned out, though, Mr. Bucklew\u2019s case\nsoon became caught up in a wave of litigation over lethal injection\nprocedures. Like many States, Missouri has periodically sought to\nimprove its administration of the death penalty. Early in the 20th\ncentury, the State replaced hanging with the gas chamber. Later in\nthe century, it authorized the use of lethal injection as an\nalternative to lethal gas. By the time Mr. Bucklew\u2019s\npost-conviction proceedings ended, Missouri\u2019s protocol called for\nlethal injections to be carried out using three drugs: sodium\nthiopental, pancuronium bromide, and potassium chloride. And by\nthat time, too, various inmates were in the process of challenging\nthe constitutionality of the State\u2019s protocol and others like it\naround the country. SeeTaylorv.Crawford, 457 F.3d\n902 (CA8 2006); Note, A New Test for Evaluating Eighth Amendment\nChallenges to Lethal Injections, 120 Harv. L.\u00a0Rev. 1301, 1304\n(2007) (describing flood of lethal injection lawsuits around 2006\nthat \u201cseverely constrained states\u2019 ability to carry out\nexecutions\u201d); Denno, The Lethal Injection Quandary: How Medicine\nHas Dismantled the Death Penalty, 76 Ford. L.\u00a0Rev. 49, 102\u2013116\n(2007).Ultimately, this Court answered these legal\nchallenges inBazev.Rees,553 U.S.\n35(2008). Addressing Kentucky\u2019s similar three-drug protocol,\nThe Chief Justice, joined by Justice Alito and Justice Kennedy,\nconcluded that a State\u2019s refusal to alter its lethal injection\nprotocol could violate the Eighth Amendment only if an inmate first\nidentified a \u201cfeasible, readily implemented\u201d alternative procedure\nthat would \u201csignificantly reduce a substantial risk of severe\npain.\u201dId., at 52. Justice Thomas, joined by Justice Scalia,\nthought the protocol passed muster because it was not intended \u201cto\nadd elements of terror, pain, or disgrace to the death penalty.\u201dId., at 107. Justice Breyer reached the same result because\nhe saw no evidence that the protocol created \u201ca significant risk of\nunnecessary suffering.\u201dId., at 113. And though Justice\nStevens objected to the continued use of the death penalty, he\nagreed that petitioners\u2019 evidence was insufficient.Id., at\n87. After this Court decidedBaze, it denied review in a\ncase seeking to challenge Missouri\u2019s similar lethal injection\nprotocol.Taylorv.Crawford, 487 F.3d 1072 (2007),\ncert. denied, 553 U.S. 1004 (2008).But that still was not the end of it. Next, Mr.\nBucklew and other inmates unsuccessfully challenged Missouri\u2019s\nprotocol in state court, alleging that it had been adopted in\ncontravention of Missouri\u2019s Administrative Procedure Act.Middletonv.Missouri Dept. of Corrections, 278\nS.W.3d 193 (Mo.), cert. denied, 556 U.S. 1255 (2009). They also\nunsuccessfully challenged the protocol in federal court, this time\nalleging it was pre-empted by various federal statutes.Ringov.Lombardi, 677 F.3d 793 (CA8 2012). And Mr.\nBucklew sought to intervene in yet another lawsuit alleging that\nMissouri\u2019s protocol violated the Eighth Amendment because\nunqualified personnel might botch its administration. That lawsuit\nfailed too.Clemonsv.Crawford, 585 F.3d 1119 (CA8\n2009), cert. denied, 561 U.S. 1026 (2010).While all this played out, pressure from\nanti-death-penalty advocates induced the company that manufactured\nsodium thiopental to stop supplying it for use in executions. As a\nresult, the State was unable to proceed with executions until it\ncould change its lethal injection protocol again. This it did in\n2012, prescribing the use of a single drug, the sedative propofol.\nSoon after that, Mr. Bucklew and other inmates sued to invalidate\nthis new protocol as well, alleging that it would produce\nexcruciating pain and violate the Eighth Amendment on its face.\nAfter the State revised the protocol in 2013 to use the sedative\npentobarbital instead of propofol, the inmates amended their\ncomplaint to allege that pentobarbital would likewise violate the\nConstitution.CThings came to a head in 2014. With its new\nprotocol in place and the necessary drugs now available, the State\nscheduled Mr. Bucklew\u2019s execution for May 21. But 12 days before\nthe execution Mr. Bucklew filed yet another lawsuit, the one now\nbefore us. In this case, he presented an as-applied Eighth\nAmendment challenge to the State\u2019s new protocol. Whether or not it\nwould cause excruciating pain forallprisoners, as his\nprevious lawsuit alleged, Mr. Bucklew now contended that the\nState\u2019s protocol would causehimsevere pain because of his\nparticular medical condition. Mr. Bucklew suffers from a disease\ncalled cavernous hemangioma, which causes vascular tumors\u2014clumps of\nblood vessels\u2014to grow in his head, neck, and throat. His complaint\nalleged that this condition could prevent the pentobarbital from\ncirculating properly in his body; that the use of a chemical dye to\nflush the intravenous line could cause his blood pressure to spike\nand his tumors to rupture; and that pentobarbital could interact\nadversely with his other medications.These latest protocol challenges yielded mixed\nresults. The district court dismissed both the inmates\u2019 facial\nchallenge and Mr. Bucklew\u2019s as-applied challenge. But, at Mr.\nBucklew\u2019s request, this Court agreed to stay his execution until\nthe Eighth Circuit could hear his appeal.Bucklewv.Lombardi, 572 U.S. 1131 (2014). Ultimately, the Eighth\nCircuit affirmed the dismissal of the facial challenge.Zinkv.Lombardi, 783 F.3d 1089 (en banc) (per curiam),\ncert. denied, 576 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2015). Then, turning to the\nas-applied challenge and seeking to apply the test set forth by theBazeplurality, the court held that Mr. Bucklew\u2019s complaint\nfailed as a matter of law to identify an alternative procedure that\nwould significantly reduce the risks he alleged would flow from the\nState\u2019s lethal injection protocol. Yet, despite this dispositive\nshortcoming, the court of appeals decided to give Mr. Bucklew\nanother chance to plead his case. The court stressed that, on\nremand before the district court, Mr. Bucklew had to identify \u201cat\nthe earliest possible time\u201d a feasible, readily implemented\nalternative procedure that would address those risks.Bucklewv.Lombardi, 783 F.3d 1120, 1127\u20131128 (2015)\n(en banc).Shortly after the Eighth Circuit issued its\njudgment, this Court decidedGlossipv.Gross, 576\nU.\u00a0S. ___ (2015), rejecting a challenge to Oklahoma\u2019s lethal\ninjection protocol. There, the Court clarified that The Chief\nJustice\u2019s plurality opinion inBazewas controlling underMarksv.United States,430 U.S.\n188(1977). In doing so, it reaffirmed that an inmate cannot\nsuccessfully challenge a method of execution under the Eighth\nAmendment unless he identifies \u201can alternative that is \u2018feasible,\nreadily implemented, and in fact significantly reduces a\nsubstantial risk of severe pain.\u2019\u00a0\u201d 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___\u2013___\n(slip op., at 12\u201313). Justice Thomas, joined by Justice Scalia,\nreiterated his view that the Eighth Amendment \u201cprohibits only those\nmethods of execution that are deliberately designed to inflict\npain,\u201d but he joined the Court\u2019s opinion because it correctly\nexplained why petitioners\u2019 claim failed even under the controlling\nopinion inBaze.Glossip, 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___\n(concurring opinion) (slip op., at 1) (internal quotation marks and\nalterations omitted).DDespite the Eighth Circuit\u2019s express\ninstructions, when Mr. Bucklew returned to the district court in\n2015 he still refused to identify an alternative procedure that\nwould significantly reduce his alleged risk of pain. Instead, he\ninsisted that inmates should have to carry this burden only in\nfacial, not as-applied, challenges. Finally, after the district\ncourt gave him \u201cone last opportunity,\u201d App. 30, Mr. Bucklew filed a\nfourth amended complaint in which he claimed that execution by\n\u201clethal gas\u201d was a feasible and available alternative method that\nwould significantly reduce his risk of pain.Id., at 42. Mr.\nBucklew later clarified that the lethal gas he had in mind was\nnitrogen, which neither Missouri nor any other State had ever used\nto carry out an execution.The district court allowed Mr. Bucklew\n\u201cextensive discovery\u201d on his new proposal. 883 F.3d 1087, 1094 (CA8\n2018). But even at the close of discovery in 2017, the district\ncourt still found the proposal lacking and granted the State\u2019s\nmotion for summary judgment. By this point in the proceedings, Mr.\nBucklew\u2019s contentions about the pain he might suffer had evolved\nconsiderably. He no longer complained about circulation of the\ndrug, the use of dye, or adverse drug interactions. Instead, his\nmain claim now was that he would experience pain during the period\nafter the pentobarbital started to take effect but before it\nrendered him fully unconscious. According to his expert, Dr. Joel\nZivot, while in this semiconscious \u201ctwilight stage\u201d Mr. Bucklew\nwould be unable to prevent his tumors from obstructing his\nbreathing, which would make him feel like he was suffocating. Dr.\nZivot declined to say how long this twilight stage would last. When\npressed, however, he referenced a study on euthanasia in horses. He\nclaimed that the horses in the study had displayed some amount of\nbrain activity, as measured with an electroencephalogram (or EEG),\nfor up to four minutes after they were given a large dose of\npentobarbital. Based on Dr. Zivot\u2019s testi- mony, the district court\nfound a triable issue as to whether there was a \u201csubstantial risk\u201d\nthat Mr. Bucklew would \u201cexperience choking and an inability to\nbreathe for up to four minutes\u201d if he were executed by lethal\ninjection. App. 827. Even so, the court held, Mr. Bucklew\u2019s claim\nfailed because he had produced no evidence that his proposed\nalternative, execution by nitrogen hypoxia, would significantly\nreduce that risk.This time, a panel of the Eighth Circuit\naffirmed. The panel held that Mr. Bucklew had produced no evidence\nthat the risk of pain he alleged \u201cwould be substantially reduced by\nuse of nitrogen hypoxia instead of lethal injection as the method\nof execution.\u201d 883 F.\u00a03d, at 1096. Judge Colloton dissented,\narguing that the evidence raised a triable issue as to whether\nnitrogen gas would \u201crender Bucklew insensate more quickly than\npentobarbital.\u201dId., at 1099. The full court denied\nrehearing en banc over a dissent by Judge Kelly, who maintained\nthat, while prisoners pursuing facial challenges to a state\nexecution protocol must plead and prove an alternative method of\nexecution underBazeandGlossip, prisoners like Mr.\nBucklew who pursue as-applied challenges should not have to bear\nthat burden. 885 F.3d 527, 528 (2018).On the same day Mr. Bucklew was scheduled to be\nexecuted, this Court granted him a second stay of execution. 583\nU.\u00a0S. ___ (2018). We then agreed to hear his case to clarify\nthe legal standards that govern an as-applied Eighth Amendment\nchallenge to a State\u2019s method of carrying out a death sentence. 584\nU.\u00a0S. ___ (2018).IIWe begin with Mr. Bucklew\u2019s suggestion that\nthe test for lethal injection protocol challenges announced inBazeandGlossipshould govern only facial\nchallenges, not as-applied challenges like his. In evaluating this\nargument, we first examine the original and historical\nunderstanding of the Eighth Amendment and our precedent inBazeandGlossip. We then address whether, in light\nof those authorities, it would be appropriate to adopt a different\nconstitutional test for as-applied claims.AThe Constitution allows capital punishment.\nSeeGlossip, 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 2\u20134);Baze, 553 U.\u00a0S., at 47. In fact, death was \u201cthe\nstandard penalty for all serious crimes\u201d at the time of the\nfounding. S. Banner, The Death Penalty: An American History 23\n(2002) (Banner). Nor did the later addition of the Eighth Amendment\noutlaw the practice. On the contrary\u2014the Fifth Amendment, added to\nthe Constitution at the same time as the Eighth, expressly\ncontemplates that a defendant may be tried for a \u201ccapital\u201d crime\nand \u201cdeprived of life\u201d as a pen- alty, so long as proper procedures\nare followed. And the First Congress, which proposed both\nAmendments, made a number of crimes punishable by death. See Act of\nApr. 30, 1790, 1Stat. 112. Of course, that doesn\u2019t mean the\nAmerican people must continue to use the death penalty. The same\nConstitution that permits States to authorize capital punishment\nalso allows them to outlaw it. But it does mean that the judiciary\nbears no license to end a debate reserved for the people and their\nrepresentatives.While the Eighth Amendment doesn\u2019t forbid\ncapital punishment, it does speak to how States may carry out that\npunishment, prohibiting methods that are \u201ccruel and unusual.\u201d What\ndoes this term mean? At the time of the framing, English law still\nformally tolerated certain punishments even though they had largely\nfallen into disuse\u2014punishments in which \u201cterror, pain, or disgrace\n[were] superadded\u201d to the penalty of death. 4 W. Blackstone,\nCommentaries on the Laws of England 370 (1769). These included such\n\u201c[d]isgusting\u201d practices as dragging the prisoner to the place of\nexecution, disemboweling, quartering, public dissection, and\nburning alive, all of which Blackstone observed \u201csavor[ed] of\ntorture or cruelty.\u201dIbid.Methods of execution like these readily\nqualified as \u201ccruel and unusual,\u201d as a reader at the time of the\nEighth Amendment\u2019s adoption would have understood those words. They\nwere undoubtedly \u201ccruel,\u201d a term often defined to mean \u201c[p]leased\nwith hurting others; inhuman; hard-hearted; void of pity; wanting\ncompassion; savage; barbarous; unrelenting,\u201d 1 S. Johnson, A\nDictionary of the English Language (4th ed. 1773), or \u201c[d]isposed\nto give pain to others, in body or mind; willing or pleased to\ntorment, vex or afflict; inhuman; destitute of pity, compassion or\nkindness,\u201d 1 N. Webster, An American Dictionary of the English\nLanguage (1828). And by the time of the founding, these methods had\nlong fallen out of use and so had become \u201cunusual.\u201d 4 Blackstone,supra,at 370; Banner 76;Baze, 553 U.\u00a0S., at 97\n(Thomas, J., concurring in judgment); see also Stinneford, The\nOriginal Meaning of \u201cUnusual\u201d: The Eighth Amendment as a Bar to\nCruel Innovation, 102 Nw. U. L.\u00a0Rev. 1739, 1770\u20131771, 1814\n(2008) (observing that Americans in the late 18th and early 19th\ncenturies described as \u201cunusual\u201d governmental actions that had\n\u201cfall[en] completely out of usage for a long period of time\u201d).Contemporary evidence confirms that the people\nwho ratified the Eighth Amendment would have understood it in just\nthis way. Patrick Henry, for one, warned that unless the\nConstitution was amended to prohibit \u201ccruel and unusual\npunishments,\u201d Congress would be free to inflict \u201ctortures\u201d and\n\u201cbarbarous\u201d punishments. 3 Debates on the Federal Constitution\n447\u2013448 (J. Elliot 2d ed. 1891). Many early commentators likewise\ndescribed the Eighth Amendment as ruling out \u201cthe use of the rack\nor the stake, or any of those horrid modes of torture devised by\nhuman ingenuity for the gratification of fiendish passion.\u201d J.\nBayard, A Brief Exposition of the Constitution of the United States\n140 (1833); see B. Oliver, The Rights of an American Citizen 186\n(1832) (the Eighth Amendment prohibits such \u201cbarbarous and cruel\npunishments\u201d as \u201c[b]reaking on the wheel, flaying alive, rending\nasunder with horses, .\u00a0.\u00a0. maiming, mutilating and\nscourging to death\u201d). Justice Story even remarked that he thought\nthe prohibition of cruel and unusual punishments likely\n\u201cunnecessary\u201d because no \u201cfree government\u201d would ever authorize\n\u201catrocious\u201d methods of execution like these. 3 J. Story,\nCommentaries on the Constitution of the United States \u00a71896, p. 750\n(1833).Consistent with the Constitution\u2019s original\nunderstanding, this Court inWilkersonv.Utah,99 U.S.\n130(1879), permitted an execution by firing squad while\nobserving that the Eighth Amendment forbade the gruesome methods of\nexecution described by Blackstone \u201cand all others in the same line\nof unnecessary cruelty.\u201dId., at 135\u2013136. A few years later,\nthe Court upheld a sentence of death by electrocution while\nobserving that, though electrocution was a new mode of punishment\nand therefore perhaps could be considered \u201cunusual,\u201d it was not\n\u201ccruel\u201d in the constitutional sense: \u201c[T]he punishment of death is\nnot cruel, within the meaning of that word as used in the\nConstitution. [Cruelty] implies .\u00a0.\u00a0. something inhuman\nand barbarous, something more than the mere extinguishment of\nlife.\u201dIn\u00a0re Kemmler,136 U.S.\n436, 447 (1890).It\u2019s instructive, too, to contrast the modes of\nexecution the Eighth Amendment was understood to forbid with those\nit was understood to permit. At the time of the Amendment\u2019s\nadoption, the predominant method of execution in this country was\nhanging.Glossip, 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 2).\nWhile hanging was considered more humane than some of the\npunishments of the Old World, it was no guarantee of a quick and\npainless death. \u201cMany and perhaps most hangings were evidently\npainful for the condemned person because they caused death slowly,\u201d\nand \u201c[w]hether a hanging was painless or painful seems to have been\nlargely a matter of chance.\u201d Banner 48, 170. The force of the drop\ncould break the neck and sever the spinal cord, making death almost\ninstantaneous. But that was hardly assured given the techniques\nthat prevailed at the time. More often it seems the prisoner would\ndie from loss of blood flow to the brain, which could produce\nunconsciousness usually within seconds, or suffocation, which could\ntake several minutes.Id., at 46\u201347; J. Laurence, The\nHistory of Capital Punishment 44\u201346 (1960); Gardner, Executions and\nIndignities: An Eighth Amendment Assessment of Methods of\nInflicting Capital Punishment, 39 Ohio St. L.\u00a0J. 96, 120\n(1978). But while hanging could and often did result in significant\npain, its use \u201cwas virtually never questioned.\u201d Banner 170.\nPresumably that was because, in contrast to punishments like\nburning and disemboweling, hanging wasn\u2019t \u201cintendedto be\npainful\u201d and the risk of pain involved was considered \u201cunfortunate\nbut inevitable.\u201dIbid.; see alsoid., at 48.What does all this tell us about how the Eighth\nAmendment applies to methods of execution? For one thing, it tells\nus that the Eighth Amendment does not guarantee a prisoner a\npainless death\u2014something that, of course, isn\u2019t guaranteed to many\npeople, including most victims of capital crimes.Glossip,\n576 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 4). Instead, what unites the\npunishments the Eighth Amendment was understood to forbid, and\ndistinguishes them from those it was understood to allow, is that\nthe former were long disused (unusual) forms of punishment that\nintensified the sentence of death with a (cruel)\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018superadd[ition]\u2019\u00a0\u201d of \u201c\u00a0\u2018terror, pain, or\ndisgrace.\u2019\u00a0\u201dBaze, 553 U.\u00a0S., at 48; accord,id., at 96 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment).This Court has yet to hold that a State\u2019s method\nof execution qualifies as cruel and unusual, and perhaps\nunderstandably so. Far from seeking to superadd terror, pain, or\ndisgrace to their executions, the States have often sought more\nnearly the opposite, exactly as Justice Story predicted. Through\nmuch of the 19th century, States experimented with technological\ninnovations aimed at making hanging less painful. See Banner\n170\u2013177. In the 1880s, following the recommendation of a commission\ntasked with finding \u201c\u00a0\u2018the most humane and practical method\nknown to modern science of carrying into effect the sentence of\ndeath,\u2019\u00a0\u201d the State of New York replaced hanging with\nelectrocution.Glossip, 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at\n2). Several States followed suit in the \u201c\u00a0\u2018\u00a0\u201cbelief that\nelectrocution is less painful and more humane than\nhanging.\u201d\u00a0\u2019\u00a0\u201dIbid.Other States adopted lethal\ngas after concluding it was \u201c\u00a0\u2018the most humane [method of\nexecution] known to modern science.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIbid.And\nbeginning in the 1970s, the search for less painful modes of\nexecution led many States to switch to lethal injection.Id., at ___ (slip op., at 3);Baze, 553 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 42, 62; see also Banner 178\u2013181, 196\u2013197, 297. Notably, all of\nthese innovations occurred not through this Court\u2019s intervention,\nbut through the initiative of the people and their\nrepresentatives.Still, accepting the possibility that a State\nmight try to carry out an execution in an impermissibly cruel and\nunusual manner, how can a court determine when a State has crossed\nthe line? The Chief Justice\u2019s opinion inBaze, which a\nmajority of the Court held to be controlling inGlossip,\nsupplies critical guidance. It teaches that where (as here) the\nquestion in dispute is whether the State\u2019s chosen method of\nexecution cruelly superadds pain to the death sentence, a prisoner\nmust show a feasible and readily implemented alternative method of\nexecution that would significantly reduce a substantial risk of\nsevere pain and that the State has refused to adopt without a\nlegitimate penological reason.

Nor doBazeandGlossipsuggest\nthat traditionally accepted methods of execution\u2014such as hanging,\nthe firing squad, electrocution, and lethal injection\u2014are\nnecessarily rendered unconstitutional as soon as an arguably more\nhumane method like lethal injection becomes available. There are,\nthe Court recognized, many legitimate reasons why a State might\nchoose, consistent with the Eighth Amendment, not to adopt a\nprisoner\u2019s preferred method of execution. See,e.g.,Glossip, 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 13\u201314) (a\nState can\u2019t be faulted for failing to use lethal injection drugs\nthat it\u2019s unable to procure through good-faith efforts);Baze, 553 U.\u00a0S., at 57 (a State has a legitimate\ninterest in selecting a method it regards as \u201cpreserving the\ndignity of the procedure\u201d);id., at 66 (Alito, J.,\nconcurring) (a State isn\u2019t required to modify its protocol in ways\nthat would require the involvement of \u201cpersons whose professional\nethics rules or traditions impede their participation\u201d).As we\u2019ve seen, two Members of the Court whose\nvotes were essential to the judgment inGlossipargued that\nestablishing cruelty consistent with the Eighth Amendment\u2019s\noriginal meaning demands slightly more than the majority opinion\nthere (or theBazeplurality opinion it followed) suggested.\nInstead of requiring an inmate to establish that a State has\nunreasonably refused to alter its method of execution to avoid a\nrisk of unnecessary pain, Justice Thomas and Justice Scalia\ncontended that an inmate must show that the Stateintendedits method to inflict such pain. SeeGlossip, 576\nU.\u00a0S., at ___ (Thomas, J., concurring) (slip op., at 1);Baze, 553 U.\u00a0S., at 94\u2013107 (Thomas, J., concurring in\njudgment). But revisiting that debate isn\u2019t necessary here because,\nas we\u2019ll see, the State was entitled to summary judgment in this\ncase even under the more forgivingBaze-Glossiptest.\nSee Part III,infra.BBefore turning to the application ofBazeandGlossip, however, we must confront Mr.\nBucklew\u2019s argument that a different standard entirely should govern\nas-applied challenges like his. He admits thatBazeandGlossipsupply the controlling test in facial challenges to\na State\u2019s chosen method of execution. But he suggests that he\nshould not have to prove an alternative method of execution in his\nas-applied challenge because \u201ccertain categories\u201d of punishment are\n\u201cmanifestly cruel .\u00a0.\u00a0. without reference to any\nalternative methods.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 41\u201342 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). He points to \u201c\u00a0\u2018burning at the\nstake, crucifixion, [and] breaking on the wheel\u2019\u00a0\u201d as examples\nof \u201ccategorically\u201d cruel methods.Ibid.And, he says, we\nshould use this case to add to the list of \u201ccategorically\u201d cruel\nmethods any method that, as applied to a particular inmate, will\npose a \u201csubstantial and particular risk of grave suffering\u201d due to\nthe inmate\u2019s \u201cunique medical condition.\u201dId., at 44.The first problem with this argument is that\nit\u2019s foreclosed by precedent.Glossipexpressly held that\nidentifying an available alternative is \u201ca requirement ofallEighth Amendment method-of-execution claims\u201d alleging\ncruel pain. 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 1) (emphasis\nadded). And just as binding as this holding is the reasoning\nunderlying it. Distinguishing between constitutionally permissible\nand impermissible degrees of pain,BazeandGlossipexplained, is anecessarilycomparative exercise. To decide\nwhether the State has cruelly \u201csuperadded\u201d pain to the punishment\nof death isn\u2019t something that can be accomplished by examining the\nState\u2019s proposed method in a vacuum, but only by \u201ccompar[ing]\u201d that\nmethod with a viable alternative.Glossip, 576 U.\u00a0S.,\nat ___ (slip op., at 13); seeBaze, 553 U.\u00a0S., at 61.\nAs Mr. Bucklew acknowledges when speaking of facial challenges,\nthis comparison \u201cprovides the needed metric\u201d to measure whether the\nState is lawfully carrying out an execution or inflicting\n\u201cgratuitous\u201d pain. Brief for Petitioner 42\u201343. Yet it is that very\ncomparison and needed metric Mr. Bucklew would now have us discard.\nNor does he offer some persuasive reason for overturning our\nprecedent. To the contrary, Mr. Bucklew simply repeats the same\nargument the principal dissent offered and the Court expressly and\nthoughtfully rejected inGlossip. Just as Mr. Bucklew argues\nhere, the dissent there argued that \u201ccertain methods of execution\u201d\nlike \u201cburning at the stake\u201d should be declared \u201ccategorically\noff-limits.\u201d And just as Mr. Bucklew submits here, the dissent\nthere argued that any other \u201cintolerably painful\u201d method of\nexecution should be added to this list. 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___\u2013___\n(Sotomayor, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 23\u201324). Mr. Bucklew\u2019s\nsubmission, thus, amounts to no more than a headlong attack on\nprecedent.Mr. Bucklew\u2019s argument fails for another\nindependent reason: It is inconsistent with the original and\nhistorical understanding of the Eighth Amendment on whichBazeandGlossiprest. As we\u2019ve seen, when it comes\nto determining whether a punishment is unconstitutionally cruel\nbecause of the pain involved, the law has always asked whether the\npunishment \u201csuperadds\u201d pain well beyond what\u2019s needed to effectuate\na death sentence. And answering that question has always involved a\ncomparison with available alternatives, not some abstract exercise\nin \u201ccategorical\u201d classification. At common law, the ancient and\nbarbaric methods of execution Mr. Bucklew cites were understood to\nbe cruel precisely because\u2014by comparison to other available\nmethods\u2014they went so far beyond what was needed to carry out a\ndeath sentence that they could only be explained as reflecting the\ninfliction of pain for pain\u2019s sake. Meanwhile, hanging carried with\nit an acknowledged and substantial risk of pain but was not\nconsidered cruel because that risk was thought\u2014by comparison to\nother known methods\u2014to involve no more pain than was reasonably\nnecessary to impose a lawful death sentence. Seesupra, at\n9\u201312.What does the principal dissent have to say\nabout all this? It acknowledges thatGlossip\u2019s comparative\nrequirement helps prevent facial method-of-execution claims from\nbecoming a \u201cbackdoor means to abolish\u201d the death penalty.Post, at 8 (opinion of Breyer, J.). But, the dissent assures\nus, there\u2019s no reason to worry that as-applied method-of-execution\nchallenges might be used that way. This assurance misses the point.\nAs we\u2019ve explained, the alternative-method requirement is compelled\nby our understanding of the Constitution, not by mere policy\nconcerns.With that, the dissent is left only to rehash\nthe same argument that Mr. Bucklew offers. The dissent insists that\nsome forms of execution are just categorically cruel.Post,\nat 10\u201311. At first and like others who have made this argument, the\ndissent offers little more than intuition to support its\nconclusion. Ultimately, though, even it bows to the necessity of\nsomething firmer. If a \u201ccomparator is needed\u201d to assess whether an\nexecution is cruel, the dissent tells us, we should compare the\npain likely to follow from the use of a lethal injection in this\ncase with the pain-free use of lethal injections in mine-run cases.Post, at 10. But that\u2019s just another way of saying\nexecutions must always be carried out painlessly because they can\nbe carried out painlessly most of the time, a standard the\nConstitution has never required and this Court has re- jected time\nand time again.Supra, at 12. To determine whether the State\nis cruelly superadding pain, our precedents and history require\nasking whether the State had some other feasible and readily\navailable method to carry out its lawful sentence that would have\nsignificantly reduced a substantial risk of pain.That Mr. Bucklew and the dissent fail to respect\nthe force of our precedents\u2014or to grapple with the understanding of\nthe Constitution on which our precedents rest\u2014is more than enough\nreason to reject their view that as-applied and facial challenges\nshould be treated differently. But it turns out their position on\nthis score suffers from further problems too\u2014problems that neither\nMr. Bucklew nor the dissent even attempts to address.Take this one. A facial challenge is really just\na claim that the law or policy at issue is unconstitutional in all\nits applications. So classifying a lawsuit as facial or as-applied\naffects the extent to which the invalidity of the challenged law\nmust be demonstrated and the corresponding \u201cbreadth of the remedy,\u201d\nbut it does not speak at all to the substantive rule of law\nnecessary to establish a constitutional violation.Citizens\nUnitedv.Federal Election Comm\u2019n,558 U.S.\n310, 331 (2010). Surely it would be strange for the same words\nof the Constitution to bear entirely different meanings depending\nonly on how broad a remedy the plaintiff chooses to seek. SeeGrossv.United States, 771 F.3d 10, 14\u201315 (CADC\n2014) (\u201c\u00a0\u2018[T]he substantive rule of law is the same for both\n[facial and as-applied] challenges\u2019\u00a0\u201d);Brooklyn Legal\nServs. Corp.v.Legal Servs. Corp.,462 F.3d 219, 228 (CA2 2006) (the facial/as-applied distinction\naffects \u201cthe extent to whichthe invalidity of a statute\nneed be demonstrated,\u201d not \u201cthesubstantive rule of lawto\nbe used\u201d). And surely, too, it must count for something that we\nhave found not a single court decision in over 200 years suggesting\nthat the Eighth Amendment\u2019s meaning shifts in this way. To the\ncontrary, our precedent suggests just the opposite. In the related\ncontext of an Eighth Amendment challenge to conditions of\nconfinement, we have seen \u201cno basis whatever\u201d for applying a\ndifferent legal standard to \u201cdeprivations inflicted upon all\nprisoners\u201d and those \u201cinflicted upon particular prisoners.\u201dWilsonv.Seiter,501 U.S.\n294, 299, n.\u00a01 (1991).Here\u2019s yet another problem with Mr. Bucklew\u2019s\nargument: It invites pleading games. The line between facial and\nas-applied challenges can sometimes prove \u201camorphous,\u201dElginv.Department of Treasury,567 U.S.\n1, 15 (2012), and \u201cnot so well defined,\u201dCitizens\nUnited, 558 U.\u00a0S., at 331. Consider an example. Suppose an\ninmate claims that the State\u2019s lethal injection protocol violates\nthe Eighth Amendment when used to execute anyone with a very common\nbut not quite universal health condition. Should such a claim be\nregarded as facial or as-applied? In another context, we\nsidestepped a debate over how to categorize a comparable claim\u2014one\nthat neither sought \u201cto strike [the challenged law] in all its\napplications\u201d nor was \u201climited to plaintiff\u2019s particular case\u201d\u2014by\nconcluding that \u201c[t]he label is not what matters.\u201dDoev.Reed,561 U.S.\n186, 194 (2010). To hold now, for the first time, that choosing\na label changes the meaning of the Constitution would only\nguarantee a good deal of litigation over labels, with lawyers on\neach side seeking to classify cases to maximize their tactical\nadvantage. Unless increasing the delay and cost involved in\ncarrying out executions is the point of the exercise, it\u2019s hard to\nsee the benefit in placing so much weight on what can be an\nabstruse exercise.Finally, the burden Mr. Bucklew must shoulder\nunder theBaze-Glossiptest can be overstated. An\ninmate seeking to identify an alternative method of execution is\nnot limited to choosing among those presently authorized by a\nparticular State\u2019s law. Missouri itself seemed to acknowledge as\nmuch at oral argument. Tr. of Oral Arg. 65. So, for example, a\nprisoner may point to a well-established protocol in another State\nas a potentially viable option. Of course, in a case like that a\ncourt would have to inquire into the possibility that one State\npossessed a legitimate reason for declining to adopt the protocol\nof another. Seesupra, at 13\u201314. And existing state law\nmight be relevant to determining the proper procedural vehicle for\nthe inmate\u2019s claim. SeeHillv.McDonough, 547 U.S.\n573, 582\u2013583 (2006) (if the relief sought in a 42\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71983 action would \u201cforeclose the State from\nimplementing the [inmate\u2019s] sentence under present law,\u201d then\n\u201crecharacterizing a complaint as an action for habeas corpus might\nbe proper\u201d). But the Eighth Amendment is the supreme law of the\nland, and the comparative assessment it requires can\u2019t be\ncontrolled by the State\u2019s choice of which methods to authorize in\nits statutes. In light of this, we see little likelihood that an\ninmate facing a serious risk of pain will be unable to identify an\navailable alternative\u2014assuming, of course, that the inmate is more\ninterested in avoiding unnecessary pain than in delaying his\nexecution.IIIHaving (re)confirmed that anyone bringing a\nmethod of execution claim alleging the infliction of\nunconstitution- ally cruel pain must meet theBaze-Glossiptest, we can now turn to the question\nwhether Mr. Bucklew is able to sat- isfy that test. Has he\nidentified a feasible and readily im- plemented alternative method\nof execution the State refused to adopt without a legitimate\nreason, even though it would significantly reduce a substantial\nrisk of severe pain? Because the case comes to us after the entry\nof summary judgment, this appeal turns on whether Mr. Bucklew has\nshown a genuine issue of material fact warranting a trial.AWe begin with the question of a proposed\nalternative method. Through much of this case and despite many\nopportunities, Mr. Bucklew refused to identifyanyalternative method of execution, choosing instead to stand on his\nargument thatBazeandGlossip\u2019s legal standard\ndoesn\u2019t govern as-applied challenges like his (even after the\nEighth Circuit rejected that argument). Only when the district\ncourt warned that his continued refusal to abide this Court\u2019s\nprecedents would result in immediate dismissal did Mr. Bucklew\nfinally point to nitrogen hy- poxia. The district court then\nafforded Mr. Bucklew \u201cexten- sive discovery\u201d to explore the\nviability of that alternative. 883 F.\u00a03d, at 1094. But even\nafter all that, we conclude Mr. Bucklew has failed for two\nindependent reasons to present a triable question on the viability\nof nitrogen hypoxia as an alternative to the State\u2019s lethal\ninjection protocol.First, an inmate must show that his\nproposed alternative method is not just theoretically\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018feasible\u2019\u00a0\u201d but also \u201c\u00a0\u2018readily\nimplemented.\u2019\u00a0\u201dGlossip, 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___\u2013___\n(slip op., at 12\u201313). This means the inmate\u2019s proposal must be\nsufficiently detailed to permit a finding that the State could\ncarry it out \u201crelatively easily and reasonably quickly.\u201dMcGeheev.Hutchinson, 854 F.3d 488, 493 (CA8 2017);Arthurv.Commissioner, Ala. Dept. of Corrections,\n840 F.3d 1268, 1300 (CA11 2016). Mr. Bucklew\u2019s bare-bones proposal\nfalls well short of that standard. He has presented no evidence on\nessential questions like how nitrogen gas should be administered\n(using a gas chamber, a tent, a hood, a mask, or some other\ndelivery device); in what concentration (pure nitrogen or some\nmixture of gases); how quickly and for how long it should be\nintroduced; or how the State might ensure the safety of the\nexecution team, including protecting them against the risk of gas\nleaks. Instead of presenting the State with a read- ily implemented\nalternative method, Mr. Bucklew (and the principal dissent) point\nto reports from correctional authorities in other States indicating\nthat additional study is needed to develop a protocol for execution\nby nitrogen hypoxia. See App. 697 (Oklahoma grand jury report\nrecommending that the State \u201cretain experts\u201d and conduct \u201cfurther\nresearch\u201d to \u201cdetermine how to carry out the sentence of death by\nthis method\u201d);id., at 736 (report of Louisiana Dept. of\nPublic Safety & Corrections stating that \u201c[r]esearch\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. is ongoing\u201d to develop a nitrogen hypoxia\nprotocol). That is a proposal for more research, not the readily\nimplemented alternative thatBazeandGlossiprequire.Second, and relatedly, the State had a\n\u201clegitimate\u201d reason for declining to switch from its current method\nof execution as a matter of law.Baze, 553 U.\u00a0S., at\n52. Rather than point to a proven alternative method, Mr. Bucklew\nsought the adoption of an entirely new method\u2014one that had \u201cnever\nbeen used to carry out an execution\u201d and had \u201cno track record of\nsuccessful use.\u201dMcGehee, 854 F.\u00a03d, at 493. But\nchoosing not to be the first to experiment with a new method of\nexecution is a legitimate reason to reject it. InBazewe\nobserved that \u201cno other State ha[d] adopted\u201d the one-drug protocol\nthe inmates sought and they had \u201cproffered no study showing\u201d their\none-drug protocol would be as effective and humane as the State\u2019s\nexisting three-drug protocol. 553 U.\u00a0S., at 57. Under those\ncircumstances, we held as a matter of law that Kentucky\u2019s refusal\nto adopt the inmates\u2019 proffered protocol could not \u201cconstitute a\nviolation of the Eighth Amendment.\u201dIbid.The Eighth\nAmendment prohibits States from dredging up archaic cruel\npunishments or perhaps inventing new ones, but it does not compel a\nState to adopt \u201cuntried and untested\u201d (and thus unusual in the\nconstitutional sense) methods of execution.Id., at\n41.[1]BEven if a prisoner can carry his burden of\nshowing a readily available alternative, he must still show that it\nwould significantly reduce a substantial risk of severe pain.Glossip, 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 13);Baze, 553 U.\u00a0S., at 52. A minor reduction in risk is\ninsufficient; the difference must be clear and considerable. Over\nthe course of this litigation, Mr. Bucklew\u2019s explanation why\nnitrogen hypoxia meets this standard has evolved significantly. But\nneither of the two theories he has advanced in this Court turns out\nto be supported by record evidence.First, Mr. Bucklew points to several\nrisks that he alleges could result from use of the State\u2019s lethal\ninjection protocol that would not be present if the State used\nnitrogen gas. For example, he says the execution team might try to\ninsert an IV into one of his peripheral veins, which could cause\nthe vein to rupture; or the team might instead use an allegedly\npainful \u201ccut-down\u201d procedure to access his femoral vein. He also\nsays that he might be forced to lie flat on his back during the\nexecution, which could impair his breathing even before the\npentobarbital is administered. And he says the stress from all this\ncould cause his tumors to bleed, further impairing his breathing.\nThese risks, we may assume, would not exist if Mr. Bucklew were\nexe- cuted by his preferred method of nitrogen hypoxia.The problem with all of these contentions is\nthat they rest on speculation unsupported, if not affirmatively\ncontradicted, by the evidence in this case. Nor does the principal\ndissent contend otherwise. So, for example, uncontroverted record\nevidence indicates that the execution team will have discretion to\nadjust the gurney to whatever position is in Mr. Bucklew\u2019s best\nmedical interests. 883 F.\u00a03d, at 1092, n.\u00a03; App. 531.\nMoreover, the State agreed in the district court that it would not\ntry to place an IV in Mr. Bucklew\u2019s compromised peripheral veins.Id., at 820; see Brief for Appellant in No. 17\u20133052 (CA8),\np.\u00a07. And, assuming without granting that using a cut-down\nwould raise issues under the Eighth Amendment\u2014but seeNoonerv.Norris, 594 F.3d 592, 604 (CA8 2010) (holding\notherwise)\u2014the State\u2019s expert, Dr. Michael Antognini, testified\nwithout contradiction that it should be possible to place an IV in\nMr. Bucklew\u2019s femoral vein without using a cut-down procedure, App.\n350. Mr. Bucklew responds by pointing to the warden\u2019s testimony\nthat he once saw medical staff perform a cut-down as part of an\nexecution; but there\u2019s no evidence that what the warden saw was an\nattempt to access a femoral vein, as opposed to some other\nvein.Moreover, to the extent the record is unclear on\nany of these issues, Mr. Bucklew had ample opportunity to conduct\ndiscovery and develop a factual record concerning exactly what\nprocedures the State planned to use. He failed to do so\u2014presumably\nbecause the thrust of his constitutional claim was thatanyattempt to execute him via lethal injection would be\nunconstitutional, regardless of the specific procedures the State\nmight use. As the court of appeals explained: \u201cHaving taken the\nposition thatanylethal injection procedure would violate\nthe Eighth Amendment,\u201d Mr. Bucklew \u201cmade no effort to determine\nwhat changes, if any, the [State] would make in applying its lethal\ninjection protocol\u201d to him, and he \u201cnever urged the district court\nto establish a suitable fact-finding procedure .\u00a0.\u00a0. to\ndefine the as-applied lethal injection protocol [the State] intends\nto use.\u201d 883 F.\u00a03d, at 1095\u20131096.[2]Second, Mr. Bucklew contends that the\nlethal injection itself will expose him to a substantial risk of\nsevere pain that could be eliminated by adopting his preferred\nmethod. He claims that once the sedative pentobarbital is injected\nhe will \u201close the ability to manage\u201d the tumors in his airway and,\nas a result, will experience a \u201csense of suffocation\u201d for some\nperiod of time before the State\u2019s sedative renders him fully\nunconscious. Brief for Petitioner 12\u201313. \u201cIt is during this\nin-between twilight stage,\u201d according to his expert, Dr. Zivot,\n\u201cthat Mr. Bucklew is likely to experience prolonged feelings of\nsuffocation and excruciating pain.\u201d App. 234. Mr. Bucklew admits\nthat similar feelings of suffocation could occur with nitrogen, the\nonly difference being the potential duration of the so-called\n\u201ctwilight stage.\u201d He contends that with nitrogen the stage would\nlast at most 20 to 30 seconds, while with pentobarbital it could\nlast up to several minutes.But here again the record contains insufficient\nevidence to permit Mr. Bucklew to avoid summary judgment. For\nstarters, in the courts below Mr. Bucklew maintained he would have\ntrouble managing his airway only if he were forced to lie supine,\nwhich (as we\u2019ve explained) the evidence shows he won\u2019t be. (The\ndissenters don\u2019t address this point.) But even indulging his new\nclaim that he will have this difficulty regardless of position, he\nstill has failed to present colorable evidence that nitrogen would\nsignificantly reduce his risk of pain. We can assume for argument\u2019s\nsake that Mr. Bucklew is correct that with nitrogen the twilight\nstage would last 20 to 30 seconds. The critical question, then, is\nhow long that period might last with pentobarbital. The State\u2019s\nexpert, Dr. Antognini, testified that pentobarbital, too, would\nrender Mr. Bucklew fully unconscious and incapable of experiencing\npain within 20 to 30 seconds.Id., at 299\u2013301, 432\u2013433. Dr.\nZivot disagreed; but when he was asked how long he thought the\ntwilight stage would last with pentobarbital, his testimony was\nevasive. Eventually, he said his \u201cnumber would be longer than\u201d 20\nto 30 seconds, but he declined to say how much longer.Id.,\nat 195. Instead, he referenced a 2015 study on euthanasia in\nhorses. He said the study found that when horses were given a large\ndose of pentobarbital (along with other drugs), they exhibited\n\u201cisoelectric EEG\u201d\u2014a complete absence of detectable brain\nactivity\u2014after 52 to 240 seconds.Id., at 194\u2013196. The\ndistrict court assumed Dr. Zivot meant that \u201cpain might be felt\nuntil measurable brain activity ceases\u201d and that, extrapolating\nfrom the horse study, it might take up to four minutes for\npentobarbital to \u201cinduc[e] a state in which [Mr. Bucklew] could no\nlonger sense that he is choking or unable to breathe.\u201d The district\ncourt acknowledged, however, that this might be \u201ca generous\ninterpretation of Dr. Zivot\u2019s testimony.\u201dId., at 822, and\nn.\u00a05.In fact, there\u2019s nothing in the record to\nsuggest that Mr. Bucklew will be capable of experiencing pain for\nsignificantly more than 20 to 30 seconds after being injected with\npentobarbital. For one thing, Mr. Bucklew\u2019s lawyer now admits that\nDr. Zivot \u201ccrossed up the numbers\u201d from the horse study. Tr. of\nOral Arg. 7\u20138, 11\u201312. The study actually reported that the horses\ndisplayed isoelectric EEG between 2 and 52 seconds after infusion\nof pentobarbital was completed, with an average time of less than\n24 seconds. App. 267. So if anything, the horse study appears to\nbolster Dr. Antognini\u2019s time estimate. For another thing, everyone\nnow also seems to acknowledge that isoelectric EEG is the wrong\nmeasure. Dr. Zivot never claimed the horses were capable of\nexperiencing pain until they reached isoelectric EEG. And Mr.\nBucklew\u2019s lawyer now concedes that doctors perform major surgery on\nhuman patients with measurable EEG readings, which strongly\nsuggests that Mr. Bucklew will be insensible to painbeforereaching isoelectric EEG. Tr. of Oral Arg. 9. Finally, the record\nevidence even allows the possibility that nitrogen couldincreasethe risk of pain. Because Dr. Zivot declined to\ntestify about the likely effects of nitrogen gas, Mr. Bucklew must\nrely on Dr. Antognini\u2019s testimony. And while Dr. Antognini did say\nhe thought nitrogen\u2019s \u201conset of action\u201d could be \u201crelatively fast,\u201d\nApp. 458, he added that the effects of nitrogen could vary\ndepending on exactly how it would be administered\u2014information Mr.\nBucklew hadn\u2019t provided. Indeed, he stated that \u201cdepending on\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. how it\u2019s used, you might get more suffering from\nnitrogen gas than you would have\u201d from the State\u2019s current\nprotocol.Id., at 460\u2013461.Of course, the principal dissent maintains that\nDr. Zivot\u2019s testimony supports an inference that pentobarbital\nmight cause Mr. Bucklew to suffer for a prolonged period. But its\nargument rests on a number of mistakes about the record. For\nexample, the dissent points to Dr. Zivot\u2019s remark that, with\npentobarbital, \u201c\u00a0\u2018the period of time between receiving the\ninjection and death could range over a few minutes to many\nminutes.\u2019\u00a0\u201dPost, at 4, 6 (quoting App. 222). From\nthis, the dissent concludes that Mr. Bucklew may suffer for \u201cup to\nseveral minutes.\u201dPost, at 1, 6, 9. But everyone agrees that\nthe relevant question isn\u2019t how long it will take for Mr. Bucklew\nto die, but how long he will be capable of feeling pain. Seeking to\naddress the problem, the dissent next points toanotherpart\nof Dr. Zivot\u2019s testimony and says it means Mr. Bucklew could\nexperience pain during the entire time between injection and death.Post, at 6, 13 (quoting App. 222). But the dissent clips the\nrelevant quotation. As the full quotation makes clear, Dr. Zivot\nclaimed that Mr. Bucklew might be unable to \u201cmaintain the integrity\nof his airway\u201d until he died\u2014but he carefully avoided claiming that\nMr. Bucklew would be capable of feeling pain until he\ndied.[3] To avoidthisproblem, the dissent quotes Dr. Zivot\u2019s assertions that\npentobarbital might not produce \u201c\u00a0\u2018rapid\nunconsciousness\u2019\u00a0\u201d and that Mr. Bucklew\u2019s suffering with\npentobarbital could be \u201c\u00a0\u2018prolonged.\u2019\u00a0\u201dPost, at\n4\u20136, 13 (quoting App. 233\u2013234). But Dr. Zivot\u2019s statements here,\ntoo, fail to specify how long Mr. Bucklew is likely to be able to\nfeel pain. The hard fact is that, when Dr. Zivot wasfinallycompelled to offer a view on this question, his only response was\nto refer to the horse study.Id., at 195\u2013196. The dissent\u2019s\neffort to suggest that Dr. Zivot \u201cdid not rely exclusively or even\nheavily on that study,\u201dpost, at 7, is belied by (among\nother things) Mr. Bucklew\u2019s own brief in this Court, which asserted\nthat the twilight stage during which he might feel pain could last\n\u201cbetween 52 and 240 seconds,\u201d based entirely on a citation of Dr.\nZivot\u2019s incorrect testimony about the horse study. Brief for\nPetitioner 13.In sum, even if execution by nitrogen hypoxia\nwere a feasible and readily implemented alternative to the State\u2019s\nchosen method, Mr. Bucklew has still failed to present any evidence\nsuggesting that it would significantly reduce his risk of pain. For\nthat reason as well, the State was entitled to summary judgment on\nMr. Bucklew\u2019s Eighth Amendment claim.[4]IV\u201cBoth the State and the victims of crime have\nan important interest in the timely enforcement of a sentence.\u201dHill, 547 U.\u00a0S., at 584. Those interests have been\nfrustrated in this case. Mr. Bucklew committed his crimes more than\ntwo decades ago. He exhausted his appeal and separate state and\nfederal habeas challenges more than a decade ago. Yet since then he\nhas managed to secure delay through lawsuit after lawsuit. He filed\nhis current challenge just days before his scheduled execution.\nThat suit has now carried on for five years and yielded two appeals\nto the Eighth Circuit, two 11th-hour stays of execution, and\nplenary consideration in this Court. And despite all this, his suit\nin the end amounts to little more than an attack on settled\nprecedent, lacking enough evidence even to survive summary\njudgment\u2014and on not just one but many essential legal elements set\nforth in our case law and required by the Constitution\u2019s original\nmeaning.The people of Missouri, the surviving victims of\nMr. Bucklew\u2019s crimes, and others like them deserve better. Even the\nprincipal dissent acknowledges that \u201cthe long delays that now\ntypically occur between the time an offender is sentenced to death\nand his execution\u201d are \u201cexcessive.\u201dPost, at 16. The answer\nis not, as the dissent incongruously suggests, to reward those who\ninterpose delay with a decree ending capital punishment by judicial\nfiat.Post, at 18. Under our Constitution, the question of\ncapital punishment belongs to the people and their representatives,\nnot the courts, to resolve. The proper role of courts is to ensure\nthat method-of-execution challenges to law- fully issued sentences\nare resolved fairly and expeditiously. Courts should police\ncarefully against attempts to use such challenges as tools to\ninterpose unjustified delay. Last-minute stays should be the\nextreme exception, not the norm, and \u201cthe last-minute nature of an\napplication\u201d that \u201ccould have been brought\u201d earlier, or \u201can\napplicant\u2019s attempt at manipulation,\u201d \u201cmay be grounds for denial of\na stay.\u201dHill, 547 U.\u00a0S., at 584 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). So, for example, we have vacated a stay entered by\na lower court as an abuse of discretion where the inmate waited to\nbring an available claim until just 10 days before his scheduled\nexecution for a murder he had committed 24 years earlier. SeeDunnv.Ray, 586 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2019).[5] If litigation is allowed to proceed,\nfederal courts \u201ccan and should\u201d protect settled state judgments\nfrom \u201cundue interference\u201d by invoking their \u201cequitable powers\u201d to\ndismiss or curtail suits that are pursued in a \u201cdilatory\u201d fashion\nor based on \u201cspeculative\u201d theories.Id., at 584\u2013585.*The judgment of the court of appeals isAffirmed.Notes1While this case has been\npending, a few States have authorized nitrogen hypoxia as a method\nof execution. See 2018 Ala. Acts no. 2018\u2013353 (allowing condemned\ninmates to elect execution by nitrogen hypoxia); 2017 Miss. Laws\nch. 406, p. 905 (authorizing execution by nitrogen hypoxia only if\nlethal injection is held unconstitutional or is otherwise\nunavailable); 2015 Okla. Sess. Laws ch. 75, p. 244 (same). In March\n2018, officials in Oklahoma announced that, due to the\nunavailability of lethal injection drugs, the State would use\nnitrogen gas for its executions going forward. See Williams,\nOklahoma Proposes To Use Nitrogen Gas for Executions by\nAsphyxiation, N. Y. Times, Mar. 15, 2018, p. A22. But Oklahoma has\nso far been unable to find a manufacturer willing to sell it a gas\ndelivery device for use in executions. See Clay, State Not Ready\nfor Executions, The Oklahoman, Jan. 27, 2019, p. A1. To date, no\none in this case has pointed us to an execution in this country\nusing nitrogen gas.2While the district court\nallowed discovery on many other matters, Mr. Bucklew protests that\nit did not permit him to learn the identities of the lethal\ninjection execution team members, to depose them, or to inquire\ninto their qualifications, training, and experience. Like the\nEighth Circuit, we see no abuse of discretion in the district\ncourt\u2019s discovery rulings. As the district court explained, Mr.\nBucklew argues that there is no way he may be constitutionally\nexecuted by lethal injection, even with modifications to the\nState\u2019s lethal injection protocol. And in a case like that,\ndiscovery into such granular matters as who administers the\nprotocol simply is not relevant.3Here\u2019s the full\nquotation, with the portion quoted by the dissent underlined: \u201cAs a\nresult of his inability to maintain the integrity of his airway for\nthe period of timebeginning with the injection of the\nPentobarbital solution and ending with Mr. Bucklew\u2019s death several\nminutes to as long as many minutes later, Mr. Bucklew would be\nhighly likely to experience feelings of \u2018air hunger\u2019 and the\nexcruciating pain of prolonged suffocationresulting from the\ncomplete obstruction of his airway by the large vascular tumor.\u201d\nApp. 222.4The State contends that\nMr. Bucklew\u2019s claim should fail for yet another reason: because, in\nthe State\u2019s view, the evidence does not show that he is very likely\nto suffer \u201c\u00a0\u2018severepain\u2019\u00a0\u201d cognizable under the\nEighth Amendment.Glossipv.Gross, 576 U.\u00a0S.\n___, ___ (2015) (slip op., at 13) (quotingBazev.Rees,553 U.S.\n35, 52 (2008); emphasis added). We have no need, however, to\naddress that argument because (as explained above) Mr. Bucklew\nfails even to show that a feasible and readily available\nalternative could significantly reduce the pain he\nalleges.5Seeking to relitigateDunnv.Ray, the principal dissent asserts that that\ncase involved no undue delay because the inmate \u201cbrought his claim\nonly five days after he was notified\u201d that the State would not\nallow his spiritual adviser to be present with him in the execution\nchamber itself, although itwouldallow the adviser to be\npresent on the other side of a glass partition.Post, at 17.\nBut a state statute listed \u201c[t]he spiritual adviser of the\ncondemned\u201d as one of numerous individ-uals who would be allowed to\n\u201cbe present at an execution,\u201d many of whom\u2014such as \u201cnewspaper\nreporters,\u201d \u201crelatives or friends of the condemned person,\u201d and\n\u201cthe victim\u2019s immediate family members\u201d\u2014obviously would not be\nallowed into the chamber itself. Ala. Code \u00a715\u201318\u201383 (2018). The\ninmate thus had long been on notice that there was a question\nwhether his adviser would be allowed into the chamber or required\nto remain on the other side of the glass. Yet although he had been\non death row since 1999, and the State had set a date for his\nexecution on November 6, 2018, he waited until January 23,\n2019\u2014just 15 days before the execution\u2014to ask for clarification. He\nthen brought a claim 10 days before the execution and sought an\nindefinite stay. This delay implicated the \u201cstrong equitable\npresumption\u201d that no stay should be granted \u201cwhere a claim could\nhave been brought at such a time as to allow consideration of the\nmerits without requiring entry of a stay.\u201dHillv.McDonough, 547 U.S. 573, 584 (2006).",
