JAMES SCHOOL, PETITIONER19\u2013348v.DARRYL BIEL, as personal representative\nof the ESTATE OF KRISTEN BIELon writs of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the ninth circuit[July 8, 2020]Justice Alito delivered the opinion of the\nCourt.These cases require us to decide whether the\nFirst Amendment permits courts to intervene in employment disputes\ninvolving teachers at religious schools who are entrusted with the\nresponsibility of instructing their students in the faith. The\nFirst Amendment protects the right of religious institutions \u201cto\ndecide for themselves, free from state interference, matters of\nchurch government as well as those of faith and doctrine.\u201dKedroffv.Saint Nicholas Cathedral of Russian Orthodox\nChurch in North America,344 U.S.\n94, 116 (1952). Applying this principle, we held inHosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church and Schoolv.EEOC,565 U.S.\n171(2012), that the First Amendment barred a court from\nentertaining an employment discrimination claim brought by an\nelementary school teacher, Cheryl Perich, against the religious\nschool where she taught. Our decision built on a line of lower\ncourt cases adopting what was dubbed the \u201cministerial exception\u201d to\nlaws governing the employment relationship between a religious\ninstitution and certain key employees. We did not announce \u201ca rigid\nformula\u201d for determining whether an employee falls within this\nexception, but we identified circumstances that we found relevant\nin that case, including Perich\u2019s title as a \u201cMinister of Religion,\nCommissioned,\u201d her educational training, and her responsibility to\nteach religion and participate with students in religious\nactivities.Id., at 190\u2013191.In the cases now before us, we consider\nemployment discrimination claims brought by two elementary school\nteachers at Catholic schools whose teaching responsibilities are\nsimilar to Perich\u2019s. Although these teachers were not given the\ntitle of \u201cminister\u201d and have less religious training than Perich,\nwe hold that their cases fall within the same rule that dictated\nour decision inHosanna-Tabor. The religious education and\nformation of students is the very reason for the existence of most\nprivate religious schools, and therefore the selection and\nsupervision of the teachers upon whom the schools rely to do this\nwork lie at the core of their mission. Judicial review of the way\nin which religious schools discharge those responsibilities would\nundermine the independence of religious institutions in a way that\nthe First Amendment does not tolerate.IA1The first of the two cases we now decide\ninvolves Agnes Morrissey-Berru, who was employed at Our Lady of\nGuadalupe School (OLG), a Roman Catholic primary school in the\nArchdiocese of Los Angeles. Excerpts of Record (ER) 58 in No.\n17\u201356624 (CA9) (OLG).[1] For\nmany years, Morrissey-Berru was employed at OLG as a lay fifth or\nsixth grade teacher. Like most elementary school teachers, she\ntaught all subjects, and since OLG is a Catholic school, the\ncurriculum included religion. App. 23, 75. As a result, she was her\nstudents\u2019 religion teacher.Morrissey-Berru earned a B.\u00a0A. in English\nLanguage Arts, with a minor in secondary education, and she holds a\nCalifornia teaching credential.Id., at 21\u201322. While on the\nfaculty at OLG, she took religious education courses at the\nschool\u2019s request, ER 41\u2013ER 42, ER 44\u2013ER 45, ER 276, and was\nexpected to attend faculty prayer services, App. to Pet. for Cert.\nin No. 19\u2013267, p.\u00a087a.[2]Each year, Morrissey-Berru and OLG entered into\nan employment agreement, App. 21,[3] that set out the school\u2019s \u201cmission\u201d and\nMorrissey-Berru\u2019s duties. See,e.g.,id., at\n154\u2013164.[4] The agreement\nstated that the school\u2019s mission was \u201cto develop and promote a\nCatholic School Faith Community,\u201did., at 154, and it\ninformed Morrissey-Berru that \u201c[a]ll [her] duties and\nresponsibilities as a Teache[r were to] be performed within this\noverriding commitment.\u201dIbid.The agreement explained that\nthe school\u2019s hiring and retention decisions would be guided by its\nCatholic mission, and the agreement made clear that teachers were\nexpected to \u201cmodel and promote\u201d Catholic \u201cfaith and morals.\u201dId., at 155. Under the agreement, Morrissey-Berru was\nrequired to participate in \u201c[s]chool liturgical activities, as\nrequested,\u201dibid., and the agreement specified that she\ncould be terminated \u201cfor \u2018cause\u2019\u00a0\u201d for failing to carry out\nthese duties or for \u201cconduct that brings discredit upon the School\nor the Roman Catholic Church.\u201dId., at 155\u2013157. The\nagreement required compliance with the faculty handbook, which sets\nout similar expectations.Id., at 156; App. to Pet. for\nCert. in No. 19\u2013267, at 52a\u201355a. The pastor of the parish, a\nCatholic priest, had to approve Morrissey-Berru\u2019s hiring each year.Id., at 14a; see also App. 164.Like all teachers in the Archdiocese of Los\nAngeles, Morrissey-Berru was \u201cconsidered a catechist,\u201di.e.,\n\u201ca teacher of religio[n].\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 19\u2013267, at\n56a, 60a. Catechists are \u201cresponsible for the faith formation of\nthe students in their charge each day.\u201dId., at 56a.\nMorrissey-Berru provided religious instruction every day using a\ntextbook designed for use in teaching religion to young Catholic\nstudents.Id., at 45a\u201351a, 90a\u201392a; see App. 79\u201380. Under\nthe prescribed curriculum, she was expected to teach students,\namong other things, \u201cto learn and express belief that Jesus is the\nson of God and the Word made flesh\u201d; to \u201cidentify the ways\u201d the\nchurch \u201ccarries on the mission of Jesus\u201d; to \u201clocate, read and\nunderstand stories from the Bible\u201d; to \u201cknow the names, meanings,\nsigns and symbols of each of the seven sacraments\u201d; and to be able\nto \u201cexplain the communion of saints.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. in No.\n19\u2013267, at 91a\u201392a. She tested her students on that curriculum in a\nyearly exam.Id., at 87a. She also directed and produced an\nannual passion play.Id., at 26a.Morrissey-Berru prepared her students for\nparticipation in the Mass and for communion and confession.Id., at 68a, 81a, 88a\u201389a. She also occasionally selected\nand prepared students to read at Mass.Id., at 83a, 89a. And\nshe was expected to take her students to Mass once a week and on\ncertain feast days (such as the Feast Day of St. Juan Diego, All\nSaints Day, and the Feast of Our Lady), and to take them to\nconfession and to pray the Stations of the Cross.Id., at\n68a\u201369a, 83a, 88a. Each year, she brought them to the Catholic\nCathedral in Los Angeles, where they participated as altar servers.Id., at 95a\u201396a. This visit, she explained, was \u201can\nimportant experience\u201d because \u201c[i]t is a big honor\u201d for children to\n\u201cserve the altar\u201d at the cathedral.Id., at 96a.Morrissey-Berru also prayed with her students.\nHer class began or ended every day with a Hail Mary.Id., at\n87a. She led the students in prayer at other times, such as when a\nfamily member was ill.Id., at 21a, 81a, 86a\u201387a. And she\ntaught them to recite the Apostle\u2019s Creed and the Nicene Creed, as\nwell as prayers for specific purposes, such as in connection with\nthe sacrament of confession.Id., at 20a\u201321a, 92a.The school reviewed Morrissey-Berru\u2019s\nperformance under religious standards. The \u201c\u00a0\u2018Classroom\nObservation Report\u2019\u00a0\u201d evaluated whether Catholic values were\n\u201cinfused through all subject areas\u201d and whether there were\nreligious signs and displays in the classroom.Id., at 94a,\n95a; App. 59. Morrissey-Berru testified that she tried to instruct\nher students \u201cin a manner consistent with the teachings of the\nChurch,\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 19\u2013267, at 96a, and she said\nthat she was \u201ccommitted to teaching children Catholic values\u201d and\nproviding a \u201cfaith-based education.\u201dId., at 82a. And the\nschool principal confirmed that Morrissey-Berru was expected to do\nthese things.[5]2In 2014, OLG asked Morrissey-Berru to move\nfrom a full-time to a part-time position, and the next year, the\nschool declined to renew her contract. She filed a claim with the\nEqual Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), received a\nright-to-sue letter, App. 169, and then filed suit under the Age\nDiscrimination in Employment Act of 1967, 81Stat. 602, as amended,\n29 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7621et\u00a0seq., claiming that the\nschool had demoted her and had failed to renew her contract so that\nit could replace her with a younger teacher. App. 168\u2013169. The\nschool maintains that it based its decisions on classroom\nperformance\u2014specifically, Morrissey-Berru\u2019s difficulty in\nadministering a new reading and writing program, which had been\nintroduced by the school\u2019s new principal as part of an effort to\nmaintain accreditation and improve the school\u2019s academic program.\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 19\u2013267, at 66a\u201367a, 70a, 73a.Invoking the \u201cministerial exception\u201d that we\nrecognized inHosanna-Tabor, OLG successfully moved for\nsummary judgment, but the Ninth Circuit reversed in a brief\nopinion. 769 Fed. Appx. 460, 461 (2019). The court acknowledged\nthat Morrissey-Berru had \u201csignificant religious responsibilities\u201d\nbut reasoned that \u201can employee\u2019s duties alone are not dispositive\nunderHosanna-Tabor\u2019s framework.\u201dIbid. Unlike\nPerich, the court noted, Morrissey-Berru did not have the formal\ntitle of \u201cminister,\u201d had limited formal religious training, and\n\u201cdid not hold herself out to the public as a religious leader or\nminister.\u201dIbid. In the court\u2019s view, these \u201cfactors\u201d\noutweighed the fact that she was invested with significant\nreligious responsibilities.Ibid. The court therefore held\nthat Morrissey-Berru did not fall within the \u201cministerial\nexception.\u201d OLG filed a petition for certiorari, and we granted\nreview.B1The second case concerns the late Kristen\nBiel, who worked for about a year and a half as a lay teacher at\nSt. James School, another Catholic primary school in Los Angeles.\nFor part of one academic year, Biel served as a long-term\nsubstitute teacher for a first grade class, and for one full year\nshe was a full-time fifth grade teacher. App. 336\u2013337. Like\nMorrissey-Berru, she taught all subjects, including religion.Id., at 288; ER 588 in No. 17\u201355180 (CA9) (St.\nJames).[6]Biel had a B.\u00a0A. in liberal studies and a\nteaching credential. App. 244. During her time at St. James, she\nattended a religious conference that imparted \u201c[d]ifferent\ntechniques on teaching and incorporating God\u201d into the classroom.Id., at 260\u2013262. Biel was Catholic.[7]Biel\u2019s employment agreement was in pertinent\npart nearly identical to Morrissey-Berru\u2019s. Compareid., at\n154\u2013164, withid., at 320\u2013329. The agreement set out the\nsame religious mission; required teachers to serve that mission;\nimposed commitments regarding religious instruction, worship, and\npersonal modeling of the faith; and explained that teachers\u2019\nperformance would be reviewed on those bases.Biel\u2019s agreement also required compliance with\nthe St. James faculty handbook, which resembles the OLG handbook.Id., at 322. Compare ER 641\u2013ER 651 (OLG) with ER 565\u2013ER 597\n(St. James). The St. James handbook defines \u201creligious development\u201d\nas the school\u2019s first goal and provides that teachers must \u201cmode[l]\nthe faith life,\u201d \u201cexemplif[y] the teachings of Jesus Christ,\u201d\n\u201cintegrat[e] Catholic thought and principles into secular\nsubjects,\u201d and \u201cprepar[e] students to receive the sacraments.\u201dId.,at ER 570\u2013ER 572. The school principal confirmed these\nexpectations.[8]Like Morrissey-Berru, Biel instructed her\nstudents in the tenets of Catholicism. She was required to teach\nreligion for 200 minutes each week, App. 257\u2013258, and administered\na test on religion every week,id., at 256\u2013257. She used a\nreligion textbook selected by the school\u2019s principal, a Catholic\nnun.Id., at 255; ER 37 (St. James). The religious\ncurriculum covered \u201cthe norms and doctrines of the Catholic Faith,\nincluding .\u00a0.\u00a0. the sacraments of the Catholic Church,\nsocial teachings according to the Catholic Church, morality, the\nhistory of Catholic saints, [and] Catholic prayers.\u201d App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. in No. 19\u2013348, p.\u00a083a.Biel worshipped with her students. At St. James,\nteachers are responsible for \u201cprepar[ing] their students to be\nactive participants at Mass, with particular emphasis on Mass\nresponses,\u201d ER 587, and Biel taught her students about \u201cCatholic\npractices like the Eucharist and confession,\u201did., at ER\n226\u2013ER 227. At monthly Masses, she prayed with her students. App.\nto Pet. for Cert. in No. 19\u2013348, at 82a, 94a\u201396a. Her students\nparticipated in the liturgy on some occasions by presenting the\ngifts (bringing bread and wine to the priest).Ibid.Teachers at St. James were \u201crequired to pray\nwith their students every day,\u201did., at 80a\u201381a, 110a, and\nBiel observed this requirement by opening and closing each school\nday with prayer, including the Lord\u2019s Prayer or a Hail Mary,id., at 81a\u201382a, 93a, 110a.As at OLG, teachers at St. James are evaluated\non their fulfillment of the school\u2019s religious mission.Id.,\nat 83a\u201384a. St. James used the same classroom observation standards\nas OLG and thus examined whether teachers \u201cinfus[ed]\u201d Catholic\nvalues in all their teaching and included religious displays in\ntheir classrooms.Id., at 83a\u201384a, 92a. The school\u2019s\nprincipal, a Catholic nun, evaluated Biel on these measures.Id., at 106a.2St. James declined to renew Biel\u2019s contract\nafter one full year at the school. She filed charges with the EEOC,\nand after receiving a right-to-sue letter, brought this suit,\nalleging that she was discharged because she had requested a leave\nof absence to obtain treatment for breast cancer. App. 337\u2013338. The\nschool maintains that the decision was based on poor\nperformance\u2014namely, a failure to observe the planned curriculum and\nkeep an orderly classroom. Seeid., at 303; App. to Pet. for\nCert. in No. 19\u2013348, at 85a\u201389a, 114a\u2013115a, 120a\u2013121a.Like OLG, St. James obtained summary judgment\nunder the ministerial exception,id., at 74a, but a divided\npanel of the Ninth Circuit reversed, reasoning that Biel lacked\nPerich\u2019s \u201ccredentials, training, [and] ministerial background,\u201d 911\nF.3d 603, 608 (2018).Judge D. Michael Fisher, sitting by designation,\ndissented. Considering the totality of the circumstances, he would\nhave held that the ministerial exception applied \u201cbecause of the\nsubstance reflected in [Biel\u2019s] title and the important religious\nfunctions she performed\u201d as a \u201cstewar[d] of the Catholic faith to\nthe children in her class.\u201dId., at 621, 622.An unsuccessful petition for rehearing en banc\nensued. Judge Ryan D. Nelson, joined by eight other judges,\ndissented. 926 F.3d 1238, 1239 (2019). Judge Nelson faulted the\npanel majority for \u201cembrac[ing] the narrowest construction\u201d of the\nministerial exception, departing from \u201cthe consensus of our sister\ncircuits that the employee\u2019s ministerial function should be the key\nfocus,\u201d and demanding nothing less than a \u201ccarbon copy\u201d of the\nspecific facts inHosanna-Tabor.Ibid. We granted\nreview and consolidated the case with OLG\u2019s. 589 U.\u00a0S. ___\n(2019).IIAThe First Amendment provides that \u201cCongress\nshall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or\nprohibiting the free exercise thereof.\u201d Among other things, the\nReligion Clauses protect the right of churches and other religious\ninstitutions to decide matters \u201c\u00a0\u2018of faith and\ndoctrine\u2019\u00a0\u201d without government intrusion.Hosanna-Tabor, 565 U.\u00a0S., at 186 (quotingKedroff, 344 U.\u00a0S., at 116). State interference in that\nsphere would obviously violate the free exercise of religion, and\nany attempt by government to dictate or even to influence such\nmatters would constitute one of the central attributes of an\nestablishment of religion. The First Amendment outlaws such\nintrusion.The independence of religious institutions in\nmatters of \u201cfaith and doctrine\u201d is closely linked to independence\nin what we have termed \u201c\u00a0\u2018matters of church\ngovernment.\u2019\u00a0\u201d 565 U.\u00a0S., at 186. This does not mean that\nreligious institutions enjoy a general immunity from secular laws,\nbut it does protect their autonomy with respect to internal\nmanagement decisions that are essential to the institution\u2019s\ncentral mission. And a component of this autonomy is the selection\nof the individuals who play certain key roles.The \u201cministerial exception\u201d was based on this\ninsight. Under this rule, courts are bound to stay out of\nemployment disputes involving those holding certain important\npositions with churches and other religious institutions. The rule\nappears to have acquired the label \u201cministerial exception\u201d because\nthe individuals involved in pioneering cases were described as\n\u201cministers.\u201d SeeMcClurev.Salvation Army, 460 F.2d\n553, 558\u2013559 (CA5 1972);Rayburnv.General Conference\nofSeventh-day Adventists, 772 F.2d 1164, 1168 (CA4\n1985). Not all pre-Hosanna-Tabordecisions applying the\nexception involved \u201cministers\u201d or even members of the clergy. See,e.g.,EEOCv.Southwestern Baptist Theological\nSeminary, 651 F.2d 277, 283\u2013284 (CA5 1981);EEOCv.Roman Catholic Diocese of Raleigh,N.\u00a0C.,213 F.3d 795, 800\u2013801 (CA4 2000). But it is instructive to\nconsider why a church\u2019s independence on matters \u201cof faith and\ndoctrine\u201d requires the authority to select, supervise, and if\nnecessary, remove a minister without interference by secular\nauthorities. Without that power, a wayward minister\u2019s preaching,\nteaching, and counseling could contradict the church\u2019s tenets and\nlead the congregation away from the faith.[9] The ministerial exception was recognized to preserve\na church\u2019s independent authority in such matters.BWhen the so-called ministerial exception\nfinally reached this Court inHosanna-Tabor, we unanimously\nrecognized that the Religion Clauses foreclose certain employment\ndiscrimination claims brought against religious organizations. 565\nU.\u00a0S., at 188. The constitutional foundation for our holding\nwas the general principle of church autonomy to which we have\nalready referred: independence in matters of faith and doctrine and\nin closely linked matters of internal government. The three prior\ndecisions on which we primarily relied drew on this broad\nprinciple, and none was exclusively concerned with the selection or\nsupervision of clergy.Watsonv.Jones, 13 Wall. 679\n(1872), involved a dispute about the control of church property,\nand bothKedroff,344 U.S.\n94, andSerbian Eastern Orthodox Diocese for United States\nand Canadav.Milivojevich,426\nU.S. 696(1976), also concerned the control of property, as\nwell as the appointment and authority of bishops.In addition to these precedents, we looked to\nthe \u201cbackground\u201d against which \u201cthe First Amendment was adopted.\u201dHosanna-Tabor, 565 U.\u00a0S., at 183. We noted that\n16th-century British statutes had given the Crown the power to fill\nhigh \u201creligious offices\u201d and to control the exercise of religion in\nother ways, and we explained that the founding generation sought to\nprevent a repetition of these practices in our country.Ibid. Because Cheryl Perich, the teacher inHosanna-Tabor, had a title that included the word\n\u201cminister,\u201d we naturally concentrated on historical events\ninvolving clerical offices, but the abuses we identified were not\nlimited to the control of appointments.We pointed to the various Acts of Uniformity,id., at 182, which dictated what ministers could preach and\nimposed penalties for non-compliance. Under the 1549 Act, a\nminister who \u201cpreach[ed,] declare[d,] or [spoke] any thing\u201d in\nderogation of any part of the Book of Common Prayer could be\nsentenced to six months in jail for a first offense and life\nimprisonment for a third violation. Act of Uniformity, 2 & 3\nEdw. 6, ch. 1. In addition, all other English subjects were\nforbidden to say anything against the Book of Common Prayer in\n\u201c[i]nterludes[,] play[s,] song[s,] r[h]ymes, or by other open\n[w]ord[s].\u201dIbid.A 1559 law contained similar prohibitions.\nSee Act of Uniformity, 1 Eliz., ch. 2.After the Restoration, Parliament enacted a new\nlaw with a similar aim. Ministers and \u201cLecturer[s]\u201d were required\nto pledge \u201cunfeigned assent and consent\u201d to the Book of Common\nPrayer, and all schoolmasters, private tutors, and university\nprofessors were required to \u201cconforme to the Liturgy of the Church\nof England\u201d and not \u201cto endeavour any change or alteration\u201d of the\nchurch. Act of Uniformity, 1662, 14 Car. 2, ch. 4.British law continued to impose religious\nrestrictions on education in the 18th century and past the time of\nthe adoption of the First Amendment. The Schism or Established\nChurch Act of 1714, 13 Ann., ch. 7, required that schoolmasters and\ntutors be licensed by a bishop. Non-conforming Protestants, as well\nas Catholics and Jews, could not teach at or attend the two\nuniversities, and as Blackstone wrote, \u201c[p]ersons professing the\npopish religion [could] not keep or teach any school under pain of\nperpetual imprisonment.\u201d 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws\nof England 55 (8th ed. 1778). The law also imposed penalties on\n\u201cany person [who] sen[t] another abroad to be educated in the\npopish religion .\u00a0.\u00a0. or [who] contribute[d] to their\nmaintenance when there.\u201dId., at 55\u201356.British colonies in North America similarly\ncontrolled both the appointment of clergy, seeHosanna-Tabor, 565 U.\u00a0S., at 183, and the teaching of\nstudents. A Maryland law \u201cprohibited any Catholic priest or lay\nperson from keeping school, or taking upon himself the education of\nyouth.\u201d 2 T. Hughes, History of the Society of Jesus in North\nAmerica: Colonial and Federal 443\u2013444 (1917). In 1771, the Governor\nof New York was instructed to require that all schoolmasters\narriving from England obtain a license from the Bishop of London. 3\nC. Lincoln, The Constitutional History of New York 485, 745 (1906).\nNew York law also required an oath and license for any\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018vagrant Preacher, Moravian, or disguised Papist\u2019\u00a0\u201d to\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018Preach or Teach, Either in Public or Private.\u2019\u00a0\u201d S.\nCobb, The Rise of Religious Liberty in America 358 (1902).CInHosanna-Tabor, Cheryl Perich, a\nkindergarten and fourth grade teacher at an Evangelical Lutheran\nschool, filed suit in federal court, claiming that she had been\ndischarged because of a disability, in violation of the Americans\nwith Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a712112(a). The school responded that the real reason for her\ndismissal was her violation of the Lutheran doctrine that disputes\nshould be resolved internally and not by going to outside\nauthorities. We held that her suit was barred by the \u201cministerial\nexception\u201d and noted that it \u201cconcern[ed] government interference\nwith an internal church decision that affects the faith and mission\nof the church.\u201d 565 U.\u00a0S., at 190. We declined \u201cto adopt a\nrigid formula for deciding when an employee qualifies as a\nminister,\u201d and we added that it was \u201cenough for us to conclude, in\nthis our first case involving the ministerial exception, that the\nexception covers Perich, given all the circumstances of her\nemployment.\u201dId., at 190\u2013191. We identified four relevant\ncircumstances but did not highlight any as essential.First, we noted that her church had given Perich\nthe title of \u201cminister, with a role distinct from that of most of\nits members.\u201dId., at 191. Although she was not a minister\nin the usual sense of the term\u2014she was not a pastor or deacon, did\nnot lead a congregation, and did not regularly conduct religious\nservices\u2014she was classified as a \u201ccalled\u201d teacher, as opposed to a\nlay teacher, and after completing certain academic requirements,\nwas given the formal title \u201c\u00a0\u2018Minister of Religion,\nCommissioned.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId., at 177\u2013178, 191.Second, Perich\u2019s position \u201creflected a\nsignificant degree of religious training followed by a formal\nprocess of commissioning.\u201dId., at 191.Third, \u201cPerich held herself out as a minister of\nthe Church by accepting the formal call to religious service,\naccording to its terms,\u201d and by claiming certain tax benefits.Id., at 191\u2013192.Fourth, \u201cPerich\u2019s job duties reflected a role in\nconveying the Church\u2019s message and carrying out its mission.\u201dId., at 192. The church charged her with \u201c\u00a0\u2018lead[ing]\nothers toward Christian maturity\u2019\u00a0\u201d and \u201c\u00a0\u2018teach[ing]\nfaithfully the Word of God, the Sacred Scriptures, in its truth and\npurity and as set forth in all the symbolical books of the\nEvangelical Lutheran Church.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIbid.Although Perich\nalso provided instruction in secular subjects, she taught religion\nfour days a week, led her students in prayer three times a day,\ntook her students to a chapel service once a week, and participated\nin the liturgy twice a year. \u201cAs a source of religious\ninstruction,\u201d we explained, \u201cPerich performed an important role in\ntransmitting the Lutheran faith to the next generation.\u201dIbid.The case featured two concurrences. In the\nfirst, Justice Thomas stressed that courts should \u201cdefer to a\nreligious organization\u2019s good-faith understanding of who qualifies\nas its minister.\u201dId., at 196. That is so, Justice Thomas\nexplained, because \u201c[a] religious organization\u2019s right to choose\nits ministers would be hollow .\u00a0.\u00a0. if secular courts\ncould second-guess\u201d the group\u2019s sincere application of its\nreligious tenets.Id., at 197.The second concurrence argued that application\nof the \u201cministerial exception\u201d should \u201cfocus on the function\nperformed by persons who work for religious bodies\u201d rather than\nlabels or designations that may vary across faiths.Id., at\n198 (opinion of Alito, J., joined by Kagan, J.). This opinion\nviewed the title of \u201cminister\u201d as \u201crelevant\u201d but \u201cneither necessary\nnor sufficient.\u201dId., at 202. It noted that \u201cmost faiths do\nnot employ the term \u2018minister\u2019\u00a0\u201d and that some \u201cconsider the\nministry to consist of all or a very large percentage of their\nmembers.\u201dIbid. The opinion concluded that the\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018ministerial\u2019 exception\u201d \u201cshould apply to any \u2018employee\u2019 who\nleads a religious organization, conducts worship services or\nimportant religious ceremonies or rituals, or serves as a messenger\nor teacher of its faith.\u201dId., at 199.D1In determining whether a particular position\nfalls within theHosanna-Taborexception, a variety of\nfactors may be important.[10] The circumstances that informed our decision inHosanna-Taborwere relevant because of their relationship to\nPerich\u2019s \u201crole in conveying the Church\u2019s message and carrying out\nits mission,\u201did., at 192, but the other noted circumstances\nalso shed light on that connection. In a denomination that uses the\nterm \u201cminister,\u201d conferring that title naturally suggests that the\nrecipient has been given an important position of trust. In\nPerich\u2019s case, the title that she was awarded and used demanded\nsatisfaction of significant academic requirements and was conferred\nonly after a formal approval process,id., at 191, and those\ncircumstances also evidenced the importance attached to her role,ibid.But our recognition of the significance of those\nfactors in Perich\u2019s case did not mean that they must be met\u2014or even\nthat they are necessarily important\u2014in all other cases.Take the question of the title \u201cminister.\u201d\nSimply giving an employee the title of \u201cminister\u201d is not enough to\njustify the exception. And by the same token, since many religious\ntraditions do not use the title \u201cminister,\u201d it cannot be a\nnecessary requirement. Requiring the use of the title would\nconstitute impermissible discrimination, and this problem cannot be\nsolved simply by including positions that are thought to be the\ncounterparts of a \u201cminister,\u201d such as priests, nuns, rabbis, and\nimams. See Brief for Respondents 21. Nuns are not the same as\nProtestant ministers. A brief submitted by Jewish organizations\nmakes the point that \u201cJudaism has many \u2018ministers,\u2019\u00a0\u201d that is,\n\u201cthe term \u2018minister\u2019 encompasses an extensive breadth of religious\nfunctionaries in Judaism.\u201d[11] For Muslims, \u201can inquiry into whether imams or other\nleaders bear a title equivalent to \u2018minister\u2019 can present a\ntroubling choice between denying a central pillar of\nIslam\u2014i.e., the equality of all believers\u2014and risking loss\nof ministerial exception protections.\u201d[12]If titles were all-important, courts would have\nto decide which titles count and which do not, and it is hard to\nsee how that could be done without looking behind the titles to\nwhat the positions actually entail. Moreover, attaching too much\nsignificance to titles would risk privileging religious traditions\nwith formal organizational structures over those that are less\nformal.For related reasons, the academic requirements\nof a position may show that the church in question regards the\nposition as having an important responsibility in elucidating or\nteaching the tenets of the faith. Presumably the purpose of such\nrequirements is to make sure that the person holding the position\nunderstands the faith and can explain it accurately and\neffectively. But insisting in every case on rigid academic\nrequirements could have a distorting effect. This is certainly true\nwith respect to teachers. Teaching children in an elementary school\ndoes not demand the same formal religious education as teaching\ntheology to divinity students. Elementary school teachers often\nteach secular subjects in which they have little if any special\ntraining. In addition, religious traditions may differ in the\ndegree of formal religious training thought to be needed in order\nto teach. See,e.g., Brief for Ethics and Religious Liberty\nCommission of the Southern Baptist Convention et al. asAmiciCuriae12 (\u201cmany Protestant groups have\nhistorically rejected any requirement of formal theological\ntraining\u201d). In short, these circumstances, while instructive inHosanna-Tabor, are not inflexible requirements and may have\nfar less significance in some cases.What matters, at bottom, is what an employee\ndoes. And implicit in our decision inHosanna-Taborwas a\nrecognition that educating young people in their faith, inculcating\nits teachings, and training them to live their faith are\nresponsibilities that lie at the very core of the mission of a\nprivate religious school. As we put it, Perich had been entrusted\nwith the responsibility of \u201ctransmitting the Lutheran faith to the\nnext generation.\u201d 565 U.\u00a0S., at 192. One of the concurrences\nmade the same point, concluding that the exception should include\n\u201cany \u2018employee\u2019 who leads a religious organization, conducts\nworship services or important religious ceremonies or rituals, or\nserves as a messenger orteacher of its faith.\u201dId.,\nat 199 (opinion of Alito, J.) (emphasis added).Religious education is vital to many faiths\npracticed in the United States. This point is stressed by briefs\nfiled in support of OLG and St. James by groups affiliated with a\nwide array of faith traditions. In the Catholic tradition,\nreligious education is \u201c\u00a0\u2018intimately bound up with the whole\nof the Church\u2019s life.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Catechism of the Catholic Church 8\n(2d ed. 2016). Under canon law, local bishops must satisfy\nthemselves that \u201cthose who are designated teachers of religious\ninstruction in schools .\u00a0.\u00a0. are outstanding in correct\ndoctrine, the witness of a Christian life, and teaching skill.\u201d\nCode of Canon Law, Canon 804, \u00a72 (Eng. transl. 1998).Similarly, Protestant churches, from the\nearliest settlements in this country, viewed education as a\nreligious obligation. A core belief of the Puritans was that\neducation was essential to thwart the \u201cchief project of that old\ndeluder, Satan, to keep men from the knowledge of the\nScriptures.\u201d[13] Thus, in\n1647, the Massachusetts General Court passed what has been called\nthe Old Deluder Satan Act requiring every sizable town to establish\na school.[14] Most of the\noldest educational institutions in this country were originally\nestablished by or affiliated with churches, and in recent years,\nnon-denominational Christian schools have proliferated with the aim\nof inculcating Biblical values in their students.[15] Many such schools expressly set\nthemselves apart from public schools that they believe do not\nreflect their values.[16]Religious education is a matter of central\nimportance in Judaism. As explained in briefs submitted by Jewish\norganizations, the Torah is understood to require Jewish parents to\nensure that their children are instructed in the faith.[17] One brief quotes Maimonides\u2019s\nstatement that religious instruction \u201cis an obligation of the\nhighest order, entrusted only to a schoolteacher possessing \u2018fear\nof Heaven.\u2019\u00a0\u201d[18] \u201cThe\ncontemporary American Jewish community continues to place the\neducation of children in its faith and rites at the center of its\ncommunal efforts.\u201d[19]Religious education is also important in Islam.\n\u201c[T]he acquisition of at least rudimentary knowledge of religion\nand its duties [is] mandatory for the Muslim individual.\u201d[20] This precept is traced to the\nProphet Muhammad, who proclaimed that \u201c\u00a0\u2018[t]he pursuit of\nknowledge is incumbent on every Muslim.\u2019\u00a0\u201d[21] \u201c[T]he development of independent\nprivate Islamic schools ha[s] become an important part of the\npicture of Muslim education in America.\u201d[22]The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\nhas a long tradition of religious education, with roots in\nrevelations given to Joseph Smith. See Doctrine and Covenants of\nthe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints \u00a793:36 (2013). \u201cThe\nChurch Board of Education has established elementary, middle, or\nsecondary schools in which both secular and religious instruction\nis offered.\u201d[23]Seventh-day Adventists \u201ctrace the importance of\neducation back to the Garden of Eden.\u201d[24] Seventh-day Adventist formation \u201crestore[s] human\nbeings into the image of God as revealed by the life of Jesus\nChrist\u201d and focuses on the development of \u201cknowledge, skills, and\nunderstandings to serve God and humanity.\u201d[25]This brief survey does not do justice to the\nrich diversity of religious education in this country, but it shows\nthe close connection that religious institutions draw between their\ncentral purpose and educating the young in the faith.2When we apply this understanding of the\nReligion Clauses to the cases now before us, it is apparent that\nMorrissey-Berru and Biel qualify for the exemption we recognized inHosanna-Tabor. There is abundant record evidence that they\nboth performed vital religious duties. Educating and forming\nstudents in the Catholic faith lay at the core of the mission of\nthe schools where they taught, and their employment agreements and\nfaculty handbooks specified in no uncertain terms that they were\nexpected to help the schools carry out this mission and that their\nwork would be evaluated to ensure that they were fulfilling that\nresponsibility. As elementary school teachers responsible for\nproviding instruction in all subjects, including religion, they\nwere the members of the school staff who were entrusted most\ndirectly with the responsibility of educating their students in the\nfaith. And not only were they obligated to provide instruction\nabout the Catholic faith, but they were also expected to guide\ntheir students, by word and deed, toward the goal of living their\nlives in accordance with the faith. They prayed with their\nstudents, attended Mass with the students, and prepared the\nchildren for their participation in other religious activities.\nTheir positions did not have all the attributes of Perich\u2019s. Their\ntitles did not include the term \u201cminister,\u201d and they had less\nformal religious training, but their core responsibilities as\nteachers of religion were essentially the same. And both their\nschools expressly saw them as playing a vital part in carrying out\nthe mission of the church, and the schools\u2019 definition and\nexplanation of their roles is important. In a country with the\nreligious diversity of the United States, judges cannot be expected\nto have a complete understanding and appreciation of the role\nplayed by every person who performs a particular role in every\nreligious tradition. A religious institution\u2019s explanation of the\nrole of such employees in the life of the religion in question is\nimportant.IIIIn holding that Morrissey-Berru and Biel did\nnot fall within theHosanna-Taborexception, the Ninth\nCircuit misunderstood our decision. Both panels treated the\ncircumstances that we found relevant in that case as checklist\nitems to be assessed and weighed against each other in every case,\nand the dissent does much the same. That approach is contrary to\nour admonition that we were not imposing any \u201crigid formula.\u201d 565\nU.\u00a0S., at 190. Instead, we called on courts to take all\nrelevant circumstances into account and to determine whether each\nparticular position implicated the fundamental purpose of the\nexception.[26]The Ninth Circuit\u2019s rigid test produced a\ndistorted analysis. First, it invested undue significance in the\nfact that Morrissey-Berru and Biel did not have clerical titles.\n769 Fed. Appx., at 460; 911 F.\u00a03d, at 608\u2013609;Post, at\n15\u201316. It is true that Perich\u2019s title included the term \u201cminister,\u201d\nbut we never said that her title (or her reference to herself as a\n\u201cminister\u201d) was necessary to trigger theHosanna-Taborexception. Instead, \u201cthose considerations .\u00a0.\u00a0. merely\nmade Perich\u2019s case an especially easy one.\u201d Brief for United States\nasAmicus Curiae19. Moreover, both Morrissey-Berru and Biel\nhad titles. They were Catholic elementary schoolteachers,\nwhich meant that they were their students\u2019 primary teachers of\nreligion. The concept of a teacher of religion is loaded with\nreligious significance. The term \u201crabbi\u201d means teacher, and Jesus\nwas frequently called rabbi.[27] And if a more esoteric title is needed, they were\nboth regarded as \u201ccatechists.\u201d[28]Second, the Ninth Circuit assigned too much\nweight to the fact that Morrissey-Berru and Biel had less formal\nreligious schooling than Perich. 769 Fed. Appx., at 460\u2013461; 911\nF.\u00a03d, at 608;post, at 16\u201317. The significance of\nformal training must be evaluated in light of the age of the\nstudents taught and the judgment of a religious institution\nregarding the need for formal training. The schools in question\nhere thought that Morrissey-Berru and Biel had a sufficient\nunderstanding of Catholicism to teach their students,[29] and judges have no warrant to\nsecond-guess that judgment or to impose their own credentialing\nrequirements.Third, theSt. Jamespanel\ninappropriately diminished the significance of Biel\u2019s duties\nbecause they did not evince \u201cclose guidance and involvement\u201d in\n\u201cstudents\u2019 spiritual lives.\u201d 911 F. 3d, at 609;post, at 12,\n17\u201318. Specifically, the panel majority suggested that Biel merely\ntaught \u201creligion from a book required by the school,\u201d \u201cjoined\u201d\nstudents in prayer, and accompanied students to Mass in order to\nkeep them \u201c\u00a0\u2018quiet and in their seats.\u2019\u00a0\u201d 911 F.\u00a03d,\nat 609. This misrepresents the record and its significance. For\nbetter or worse, many primary school teachers tie their instruction\nclosely to textbooks, and many faith traditions prioritize teaching\nfrom authoritative texts. See Brief for InterVarsity Christian\nFellowship USA et\u00a0al. asAmici Curiae26; Brief for\nSenator Mike Lee et al. asAmici Curiae24\u201327. As for\nprayer, Biel prayed with her students, taught them prayers, and\nsupervised the prayers led by students. She prepared them for Mass,\naccompanied them to Mass, and prayed with them there. Seesupra, at 8\u20139.In Biel\u2019s appeal, the Ninth Circuit suggested\nthat theHosanna-Taborexception should be interpreted\nnarrowly because the ADA, 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a712101et\u00a0seq., and Title VII, \u00a72000e\u20132, contain provisions\nallowing religious employers to give preference to members of a\nparticular faith in employing individuals to do work connected with\ntheir activities. 911 F.\u00a03d, at 611, n.\u00a05;post,\nat 2\u20133. But theHosanna-Taborexception serves an entirely\ndifferent purpose. Think of the quintessential case where a church\nwants to dismiss its minister for poor performance. The church\u2019s\nobjection in that situation is not that the minister has gone over\nto some other faith but simply that the minister is failing to\nperform essential functions in a satisfactory manner.While the Ninth Circuit treated the\ncircumstances that we cited inHosanna-Taboras factors to\nbe assessed and weighed in every case, respondents would make the\ngoverning test even more rigid. In their view, courts should begin\nby deciding whether the first three circumstances\u2014a ministerial\ntitle, formal religious education, and the employee\u2019s\nself-description as a minister\u2014are met and then, in order to check\nthe conclusion suggested by those factors, ask whether the employee\nperformed a religious function. Brief for Respondents 20\u201324. For\nreasons already explained, there is no basis for treating the\ncircumstances we found relevant inHosanna-Taborin such a\nrigid manner.Respondents go further astray in suggesting that\nan employee can never come within theHosanna-Taborexception unless the employee is a \u201cpracticing\u201d member of the\nreligion with which the employer is associated. Brief for\nRespondents 12\u201313, 21. In hiring a teacher to provide religious\ninstruction, a religious school is very likely to try to select a\nperson who meets this requirement, but insisting on this as a\nnecessary condition would create a host of problems. As pointed out\nby petitioners, determining whether a person is a \u201cco-religionist\u201d\nwill not always be easy. See Reply Brief 14 (\u201cAre Orthodox Jews and\nnon-Orthodox Jews co- religionists? .\u00a0.\u00a0. Would\nPresbyterians and Baptists be similar enough? Southern Baptists and\nPrimitive Baptists?\u201d). Deciding such questions would risk judicial\nentanglement in religious issues.Expanding the \u201cco-religionist\u201d requirement,\nBrief for Respondents 28\u201329, 44, to exclude those who no longer\npractice the faith would be even worse,post, at 13. Would\nthe test depend on whether the person in question no longer\nconsidered himself or herself to be a member of a particular faith?\nOr would the test turn on whether the faith tradition in question\nstill regarded the person as a member in some sense?Respondents argue that Morrissey-Berru cannot\nfall within theHosanna-Taborexception because she said in\nconnection with her lawsuit that she was not \u201ca practicing\nCatholic,\u201d but acceptance of that argument would require courts to\ndelve into the sensitive question of what it means to be a\n\u201cpracticing\u201d member of a faith, and religious employers would be\nput in an impossible position. Morrissey-Berru\u2019s employment\nagreements required her to attest to \u201cgood standing\u201d with the\nchurch. See App. 91, 144, 154. Beyond insisting on such an\nattestation, it is not clear how religious groups could monitor\nwhether an employee is abiding by all religious obligations when\naway from the job. Was OLG supposed to interrogate Morrissey-Berru\nto confirm that she attended Mass every Sunday?Respondents argue that theHosanna-Taborexception is not workable unless it is given a rigid structure, but\nwe declined to adopt a \u201crigid formula\u201d inHosanna-Tabor, and\nthe lower courts have been applying the exception for many years\nwithout such a formula. Here, as inHosanna-Tabor, it is\nsufficient to decide the cases before us. When a school with a\nreligious mission entrusts a teacher with the responsibility of\neducating and forming students in the faith, judicial intervention\ninto disputes between the school and the teacher threatens the\nschool\u2019s independence in a way that the First Amendment does not\nallow.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*For these reasons, the judgment of the Court\nof Appeals in each case is reversed, and the cases are remanded for\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.Notes1A major theme of the\ndissent is that we do not heed the rule that, in deciding whether\nsummary judgment is proper, a court must view the facts in the\nlight most favorable to the party against whom summary judgment is\nsought. Seepost, at 1\u20132, 8, 10\u201311, 14 (opinion of\nSotomayor, J.). But the dissent, which approves of the Ninth\nCircuit\u2019s reasoning, seems to forget that the Ninth Circuit in\neffect granted summary judgmentin favor of the teacherson\nthe issue of the applicability of the so-called ministerial\nexception. It did not remand for a trial on that issue but instead\nheld that the exception did not apply. 769 Fed. Appx. 460, 460\u2013461\n(2019); 911 F.3d 603, 605, 611, n. 6 (2018). Therefore, if any\nmaterial facts were genuinely in dispute, the relevant parts of the\nrecord would have to be viewed in the light most favorable to the\nschools. The dissent, however, does exactly the opposite. In any\nevent, the dissent\u2019s comments about summary judgment are so much\nsmoke. It does not identify any disputed fact that is essential to\nour holding, and, although there are differences of opinion on\ncertain facts, neither party takes the position that anymaterialfact is genuinely in dispute.2After bringing suit,\nMorrissey-Berru filed a declaration stating that she is \u201cnot\ncurrently a practicing Catholic.\u201d ER 248. It is unclear what\nMorrissey-Berru means by \u201cpracticing.\u201d There is, however, no hint\nin the record that Morrissey-Berru considered herself a\nnon-practicing Catholic during her employment at OLG. Seeinfra, at 5 (describing religious observation).3This appears to have been\na standard contract used within the Archdiocese of Los Angeles. See\nApp. 154; cf.id., at 230.4It is not entirely clear\nfrom the record whether teachers at OLG must be Catholic.Id., at 113 (\u201c\u00a0[Q.] \u2018Is it a requirement that a teacher\nbe Catholic in order to teach at OLG School?

According to the dissent: \u201cHosanna-Taborcharted a way to separate leaders who \u2018personify\u2019 a church\u2019s\n\u2018beliefs\u2019 [and] \u2018minister to the faithful\u2019 from individuals who may\nsimply relay religious tenets.\u201dPost,at 7 (quoting 565\nU.\u00a0S., at 188, 195). The dissent cobbles together this new\ntest by taking phrases out of context from separate passages and\ninserting a proposition never suggested inHosanna-Tabor,\nnamely, that an individual cannot qualify for the exception if he\nor she \u201csimply relay[s] religious tenets\u201d without\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018minister[ing] to the faithful.\u2019\u00a0\u201dPost, at 7.Hosanna-Tabornever adopted this unworkable test. It did not\nsuggest that the exception it recognized applied only to \u201cleaders.\u201dPost,at 4\u20135, and n.\u00a01. The term is never used in the\nopinion of the Court. Insisting on leadership as a qualification\nwould shrink the exception even more than respondents advocate. For\nexample, they agree that it should apply to nuns, see Brief for\nRespondents 21, but, under the dissent\u2019s test, is every cloistered\nnun\u2014or every cloistered monk\u2014disqualified? And even if leadership\nwere a requirement, why couldn\u2019t a religious teacher be regarded as\na leader of the students in the class? Nor did our opinion inHosanna-Tabordraw a critical distinction between a person\nwho \u201csimply relay[s] religious tenets\u201d and one who relays such\ntenets while also \u201c\u00a0\u2018minister[ing] to the faithful.\u2019\u00a0\u201dPost,at 7. A teacher, such as an instructor in a class on\nworld religions, who merely provides a description of the beliefs\nand practices of a religion without making any effort to inculcate\nthose beliefs could not qualify for the exception, but otherwise\nthe distinction makes no sense. If a member of the Christian clergy\nor a rabbi spends almost all of his or her time studying Scripture\nor theology and writing instead of ministering to a congregation,\nwould that individual fall outside the exception as understood by\nthe dissent?27See,e.g., Mark 9:5, 11:21; John 1:38, 3:26, 4:31, 6:25,\n9:2.28See\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 19\u2013267, at 56a, 60a; ER 593 (St.\nJames) (\u201cteachers are expected to . . . engage in catechetical\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. development\u201d); Record in No. 2:15\u2013CV\u201304248 (CD\nCal.), Doc. 67\u20131, \u00b610 (\u201crequir[ing]\u201d attendance at \u201cCatholic\neducation conference\u201d to \u201cprepare teachers as religious\neducators\u201d).29The\nrecord also makes clear (contrary to the Ninth Circuit\u2019s and\ndissent\u2019s conclusion,post, at 17) that Morrissey-Berru and\nBiel \u201cheld themselves out\u201d as authorities on religion to their\nstudents, and, by extension, their families.
