To fight this\nproblem, all States have laws that prohibit motorists from driving\nwith a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) that exceeds a specified\nlevel. But determining whether a driver\u2019s BAC is over the legal\nlimit requires a test, and many drivers stopped on suspicion of\ndrunk driving would not submit to testing if given the option. So\nevery State also has long had what are termed \u201cimplied consent\nlaws.\u201d These laws impose penalties on motorists who refuse to\nundergo testing when there is sufficient reason to believe they are\nviolating the State\u2019s drunk-driving laws.In the past, the typical penalty for noncompliance was\nsuspension or revocation of the motorist\u2019s license. The cases now\nbefore us involve laws that go beyond that and make it a crime for\na motorist to refuse to be tested after being lawfully arrested for\ndriving while impaired. The question presented is whether such laws\nviolate the Fourth Amendment\u2019s prohibition against unreasonable\nsearches.IThe problem of drunk driving arose almost as soon as motor\nvehicles came into use. See J. Jacobs, Drunk Driving: An American\nDilemma 57 (1989) (Jacobs). New Jersey enacted what was perhaps the\nNation\u2019s first drunk-driving law in 1906, 1906 N.\u00a0J. Laws pp.\n186, 196, and other States soon followed. These early laws made it\nillegal to drive while intoxicated but did not provide a\nstatistical definition of intoxication. As a result, prosecutors\nnormally had to present testimony that the defendant was showing\noutward signs of intoxication, like imbalance or slurred speech. R.\nDonigan, Chemical Tests and the Law 2 (1966) (Donigan). As one\nearly case put it, \u201c[t]he effects resulting from the drinking of\nintoxicating liquors are manifested in various ways, and before any\none can be shown to be under the influence of intoxicating liquor\nit is necessary for some witness to prove that some one or more of\nthese effects were perceptible to him.\u201dStatev.Noble, 119 Ore. 674, 677, 250 P. 833, 834 (1926).The 1930\u2019s saw a continued rise in the number of motor vehicles\non the roads, an end to Prohibition, and not coincidentally an\nincreased interest in combating the growing problem of drunk\ndriving. Jones, Measuring Alcohol in Blood and Breath for Forensic\nPurposes\u2014A Historical Review, 8 For. Sci. Rev. 13, 20, 33 (1996)\n(Jones). The American Medical Association and the National Safety\nCouncil set up committees to study the problem and ultimately\nconcluded that a driver with a BAC of 0.15% or higher could be\npresumed to be inebriated. Donigan 21\u201322. In 1939, Indiana enacted\nthe first law that defined presumptive intoxication based on BAC\nlevels, using the recommended 0.15% standard. 1939 Ind. Acts p.\n309; Jones 21. Other States soon followed and then, in response to\nupdated guidance from national organizations, lowered the\npresumption to a BAC level of 0.10%. Don-igan 22\u201323. Later, States\nmoved away from mere presumptions that defendants might rebut, and\nadopted laws providing that driving with a 0.10% BAC or higher wasper\u00a0seillegal. Jacobs 69\u201370.Enforcement of laws of this type obviously requires the\nmeasurement of BAC. One way of doing this is to analyze a sample of\na driver\u2019s blood directly. A technician with medical training uses\na syringe to draw a blood sample from the veins of the subject, who\nmust remain still during the procedure, and then the sample is\nshipped to a separate laboratory for measurement of its alcohol\nconcentration. See 2 R. Erwin, Defense of Drunk Driving Cases\n\u00a7\u00a717.03\u201317.04 (3d ed. 2015) (Erwin). Although it is possible for a\nsubject to be forcibly immobilized so that a sample may be drawn,\nmany States prohibit drawing blood from a driver who resists since\nthis practice helps \u201cto avoid violent confrontations.\u201dSouth\nDakotav.Neville, 459 U.\u00a0S. 553,559 (1983).The most common and economical method of calculating BAC is by\nmeans of a machine that measures the amount of alcohol in a\nperson\u2019s breath. National Highway Traffic Safety Admin. (NHTSA), E.\nHaire, W. Leaf, D. Preusser, & M. Solomon, Use of Warrants to\nReduce Breath Test Refusals: Experiences from North Carolina 1 (No.\n811461, Apr. 2011). One such device, called the \u201cDrunkometer,\u201d was\ninvented and first sold in the 1930\u2019s. Note, 30 N.\u00a0C.\nL.\u00a0Rev. 302, 303, and n. 10 (1952). The test subject would\ninflate a small balloon, and then the test analyst would release\nthis captured breath into the machine, which forced it through a\nchemical solution that reacted to the presence of alcohol by\nchanging color.Id.,at 303. The test analyst could observe\nthe amount of breath required to produce the color change and\ncalculate the subject\u2019s breath alcohol concentration and by\nextension, BAC, from this figure.Id.,at 303\u2013304. A more\npractical machine, called the \u201cBreathalyzer,\u201d came into common use\nbeginning in the 1950\u2019s, relying on the same basic scientific\nprinciples. 3 Erwin \u00a722.01, at 22\u20133; Jones 34.Over time, improved breath test machines were developed. Today,\nsuch devices can detect the presence of alcohol more quickly and\naccurately than before, typically using infrared technology rather\nthan a chemical reaction. 2 Erwin \u00a718A.01; Jones 36. And in\npractice all breath testing machines used for evidentiary purposes\nmust be approved by the National Highway Traffic Safety\nAdministration. See 1 H. Cohen & J. Green, Apprehending and\nProsecuting the Drunk Driver \u00a77.04[7] (LexisNexis 2015). These\nmachines are generally regarded as very reliable because the\nfederal standards require that the devices produce accurate and\nreproducible test results at a variety of BAC levels, from the very\nlow to the very high. 77 Fed. Reg. 35747 (2012); 2 Erwin \u00a718.07;\nJones 38; see alsoCaliforniav.Trombetta,467\nU.\u00a0S. 479,489 (1984).Measurement of BAC based on a breath test requires the\ncooperation of the person being tested. The subject must take a\ndeep breath and exhale through a mouthpiece that connects to the\nmachine. Berger, How Does it Work? Alcohol Breath Testing, 325\nBritish Medical J. 1403 (2002) (Berger). Typically the test subject\nmust blow air into the device \u201c\u00a0\u2018for a period of several\nseconds\u2019\u00a0\u201d to produce an adequate breath sample, and the\nprocess is sometimes repeated so that analysts can compare multiple\nsamples to ensure the device\u2019s accuracy.Trombetta,supra,at 481; see also 2 Erwin \u00a721.04[2][b](L), at 21\u201314\n(describing the Intoxilyzer 4011 device as requiring a 12-second\nexhalation, although the subject may take a new breath about\nhalfway through).Modern breath test machines are designed to capture so-called\n\u201cdeep lung\u201d or alveolar air.Trombetta,supra,at\n481. Air from the alveolar region of the lungs provides the best\nbasis for determining the test subject\u2019s BAC, for it is in that\npart of the lungs that alcohol vapor and other gases are exchanged\nbetween blood and breath. 2 Erwin \u00a718.01[2][a], at 18\u20137.When a standard infrared device is used, the whole process takes\nonly a few minutes from start to finish. Berger 1403; 2 Erwin\n\u00a718A.03[2], at 18A\u201314. Most evidentiary breath tests do not occur\nnext to the vehicle, at the side of the road, but in a police\nstation, where the controlled environment is especially conducive\nto reliable testing, or in some cases in the officer\u2019s patrol\nvehicle or in special mobile testing facilities. NHTSA, A. Berning\net\u00a0al., Refusal of Intoxication Testing: A Report to Congress\n4, and n. 5 (No. 811098, Sept. 2008).Because the cooperation of the test subject is necessary when a\nbreath test is administered and highly preferable when a blood\nsample is taken, the enactment of laws defining intoxication based\non BAC made it necessary for States to find a way of securing such\ncooperation.[1] So-called \u201cimplied consent\u201d laws\nwere enacted to achieve this result. They provided that cooperation\nwith BAC testing was a condition of the privilege of driving on\nstate roads and that the privilege would be rescinded if a\nsuspected drunk driver refused to honor that condition. Donigan\n177. The first such law was enacted by New York in 1953, and many\nother States followed suit not long thereafter.Id.,at\n177\u2013179. In 1962, the Uniform Vehicle Code also included such a\nprovision.Id.,at 179. Today, \u201call 50 States have adopted\nimplied consent laws that require motorists, as a condition of\noperating a motor vehicle within the State, to consent to BAC\ntesting if they are arrested or otherwise detained on suspicion of\na drunk-driving offense.\u201dMissouriv.McNeely, 569\nU.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2013) (plurality opinion) (slip op., at 18).\nSuspension or revocation of the motorist\u2019s driver\u2019s license remains\nthe standard legal consequence of refusal. In addition, evidence of\nthe motorist\u2019s refusal is admitted as evidence of likely\nintoxication in a drunk-driving prosecution. Seeibid.In recent decades, the States and the Federal Government have\ntoughened drunk-driving laws, and those efforts have corresponded\nto a dramatic decrease in alcohol-related fatalities. As of the\nearly 1980\u2019s, the number of annual fatalities averaged 25,000; by\n2014, the most recent year for which statistics are available, the\nnumber had fallen to below 10,000. Presidential Commission on Drunk\nDriving 1 (Nov. 1983); NHTSA, Traffic Safety Facts, 2014 Data,\nAlcohol-Impaired Driving 2 (No. 812231, Dec. 2015) (NHTSA, 2014\nAlcohol-Impaired Driving). One legal change has been further\nlowering the BAC standard from 0.10% to 0.08%. See 1 Erwin,\n\u00a72.01[1], at\u00a02\u20133 to 2\u20134. In addition, many States now impose\nincreased penalties for recidivists and for drivers with a BAC\nlevel that exceeds a higher threshold. In North Dakota, for\nexample, the standard penalty for first-time drunk-driving\noffenders is license suspension and a fine. N.\u00a0D. Cent. Code\nAnn. \u00a739\u201308\u201301(5)(a)(1) (Supp. 2015); \u00a739\u201320\u201304.1(1). But an\noffender with a BAC of 0.16% or higher must spend at least two days\nin jail. \u00a739\u201308\u201301(5)(a)(2). In addition, the State imposes\nincreased mandatory minimum sentences for drunk-driving\nrecidivists. \u00a7\u00a739\u201308\u201301(5)(b)\u2013(d).Many other States have taken a similar approach, but this new\nstructure threatened to undermine the effectiveness of implied\nconsent laws. If the penalty for driving with a greatly elevated\nBAC or for repeat violations exceeds the penalty for refusing to\nsubmit to testing, motorists who fear conviction for the more\nseverely punished offenses have an incentive to reject testing. And\nin some States, the refusal rate is high. On average, over\none-fifth of all drivers asked to submit to BAC testing in 2011\nrefused to do so. NHTSA, E. Namuswe, H. Coleman, & A. Berning,\nBreath Test Refusal Rates in the United States\u20142011 Update 1 (No.\n811881, Mar. 2014). In North Dakota, the refusal rate for 2011 was\na representative 21%.Id.,at 2. Minnesota\u2019s was below\naverage, at 12%.Ibid.To combat the problem of test refusal, some States have begun to\nenact laws making it a crime to refuse to undergo testing.\nMinnesota has taken this approach for decades. See 1989 Minn. Laws\np. 1658; 1992 Minn. Laws p. 1947. And that may partly explain why\nits refusal rate now is below the national average. Minnesota\u2019s\nrate is also half the 24% rate reported for 1988, the year before\nits first criminal refusal law took effect. See Ross, Simon,\nCleary, Lewis, & Storkamp, Causes and Consequences of Implied\nConsent Refusal, 11 Alcohol, Drugs and Driving 57, 69 (1995). North\nDakota adopted a similar law, in 2013, after a pair of\ndrunk-driving accidents claimed the lives of an entire young family\nand another family\u2019s 5- and 9-year-old boys.[2]\n2013 N.\u00a0D. Laws pp. 1087\u20131088 (codified at \u00a7\u00a739\u201308\u201301(1)\u2013(3)).\nThe Federal Government also encourages this approach as a means for\novercoming the incentive that drunk drivers have to refuse a test.\nNHTSA, Refusal of Intoxication Testing, at 20.IIAPetitioner Danny Birchfield accidentally drove his car off a\nNorth Dakota highway on October 10, 2013. A state trooper arrived\nand watched as Birchfield unsuccessfully tried to drive back out of\nthe ditch in which his car was stuck. The trooper approached,\ncaught a strong whiff of alcohol, and saw that Birchfield\u2019s eyes\nwere bloodshot and watery. Birchfield spoke in slurred speech and\nstruggled to stay steady on his feet. At the trooper\u2019s request,\nBirchfield agreed to take several field sobriety tests and\nperformed poorly on each. He had trouble reciting sections of the\nalphabet and counting backwards in compliance with the trooper\u2019s\ndirections.Believing that Birchfield was intoxicated, the trooper informed\nhim of his obligation under state law to agree to a BAC test.\nBirchfield consented to a roadside breath test. The device used for\nthis sort of test often differs from the machines used for breath\ntests administered in a police station and is intended to provide a\npreliminary assessment of the driver\u2019s BAC. See,e.g.,Berger 1403. Because the reliability of these preliminary or\nscreening breath tests varies, many jurisdictions do not permit\ntheir numerical results to be admitted in a drunk-driving trial as\nevidence of a driver\u2019s BAC. See generally 3 Erwin \u00a724.03[1]. In\nNorth Dakota, results from this type of test are \u201cused only for\ndetermining whether or not a further test shall be given.\u201d\nN.\u00a0D. Cent. Code Ann. \u00a739\u201320\u201314(3). In Birchfield\u2019s case, the\nscreening test estimated that his BAC was 0.254%, more than three\ntimes the legal limit of 0.08%. See \u00a739\u201308\u201301(1)(a).The state trooper arrested Birchfield for driving while\nimpaired, gave the usualMirandawarnings, again advised him\nof his obligation under North Dakota law to undergo BAC testing,\nand informed him, as state law requires, see \u00a739\u201320\u201301(3)(a), that\nrefusing to take the test would expose him to criminal penalties.\nIn addition to mandatory addiction treatment, sentences range from\na mandatory fine of $500 (for first-time offenders) to fines of at\nleast $2,000 and imprisonment of at least one year and one day (for\nserial offenders). \u00a739\u201308\u201301(5). These criminal penalties apply to\nblood, breath, and urine test refusals alike. See \u00a7\u00a739\u201308\u201301(2),\n39\u201320\u201301, 39\u201320\u201314.Although faced with the prospect of prosecution under this law,\nBirchfield refused to let his blood be drawn. Just three months\nbefore, Birchfield had received a citation for driving under the\ninfluence, and he ultimately pleaded guilty to that offense.Statev.Birchfield, Crim. No. 30\u20132013\u2013CR\u201300720\n(Dist. Ct. Morton Cty., N.\u00a0D., Jan. 27, 2014). This time he\nalso pleaded guilty\u2014to a misde-meanor violation of the refusal\nstatute\u2014but his plea wasa conditional one: while Birchfield\nadmitted refusing the blood test, he argued that the Fourth\nAmendment prohibited criminalizing his refusal to submit to the\ntest. The State District Court rejected this argument and imposed a\nsentence that accounted for his prior conviction. Cf.\n\u00a739\u201308\u201301(5)(b). The sentence included 30 days in jail (20 of which\nwere suspended and 10 of which had already been served), 1 year of\nunsupervised probation, $1,750 in fine and fees, and mandatory\nparticipation in a sobriety program and in a substance abuse\nevaluation. App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 14\u20131468, p. 20a.On appeal, the North Dakota Supreme Court affirmed. 2015 ND 6,\n858 N.\u00a0W.\u00a02d 302. The court found support for the test\nrefusal statute in this Court\u2019sMcNeelyplurality opinion,\nwhich had spoken favorably about \u201cacceptable \u2018legal tools\u2019 with\n\u2018significant consequences\u2019 for refusing to submit to testing.\u201d 858\nN.\u00a0W. 2d, at 307 (quotingMcNeely, 569 U.\u00a0S., at\n___ (slip op., at 18)).BOn August 5, 2012, Minnesota police received a report of a\nproblem at a South St. Paul boat launch. Three apparently\nintoxicated men had gotten their truck stuck in the river while\nattempting to pull their boat out of the water. When police\narrived, witnesses informed them that a man in underwear had been\ndriving the truck. That man proved to be William Robert Bernard,\nJr., petitioner in the second of these cases. Bernard admitted that\nhe had been drinking but denied driving the truck (though he was\nholding its keys) and refused to perform any field sobriety tests.\nAfter noting that Bernard\u2019s breath smelled of alcohol and that his\neyes were bloodshot and watery, officers arrested Bernard for\ndriving while impaired.Back at the police station, officers read Bernard Minnesota\u2019s\nimplied consent advisory, which like North Dakota\u2019s informs\nmotorists that it is a crime under state law to refuse to submit to\na legally required BAC test. See Minn. Stat. \u00a7169A.51, subd. 2\n(2014). Aside from noncriminal penalties like license revocation,\n\u00a7169A.52, subd. 3, test refusal in Minnesota can result in criminal\npenalties ranging from no more than 90 days\u2019 imprisonment and up to\na $1,000 fine for a misdemeanor violation to seven years\u2019\nimprisonment and a $14,000 fine for repeat offenders, \u00a7169A.03,\nsubd. 12; \u00a7169A.20, subds. 2\u20133; \u00a7169A.24, subd. 2; \u00a7169A.27, subd.\n2.The officers asked Bernard to take a breath test. After he\nrefused, prosecutors charged him with test refusal in the first\ndegree because he had four prior impaired-driving convictions. 859\nN.\u00a0W.\u00a02d 762, 765, n.\u00a01 (Minn. 2015) (case below).\nFirst-degree refusal carries the highest maximum penalties and a\nmandatory minimum 3-year prison sentence. \u00a7169A.276, subd. 1.The Minnesota District Court dismissed the charges on the ground\nthat the warrantless breath test demanded of Bernard was not\npermitted under the Fourth Amendment. App. to Pet. for Cert. in No.\n14\u20131470, pp. 48a, 59a. The Minnesota Court of Appeals reversed,id.,at 46a, and the State Supreme Court affirmed that\njudgment. Based on the longstanding doctrine that authorizes\nwarrantless searches incident to a lawful arrest, the high court\nconcluded that police did not need a warrant to insist on a test of\nBernard\u2019s breath. 859 N.\u00a0W.\u00a02d, at 766\u2013772. Two justices\ndissented.Id.,at 774\u2013780 (opinion of Page and Stras,\nJJ.).CA police officer spotted our third petitioner, Steve Michael\nBeylund, driving the streets of Bowman, North Dakota, on the night\nof August 10, 2013. The officer saw Beylund try unsuccessfully to\nturn into a driveway. In the process, Beylund\u2019s car nearly hit a\nstop sign before coming to a stop still partly on the public road.\nThe officer walked up to the car and saw that Beylund had an empty\nwine glass in the center console next to him. Noticing that Beylund\nalso smelled of alcohol, the officer asked him to step out of the\ncar. As Beylund did so, he struggled to keep his balance.The officer arrested Beylund for driving while impaired and took\nhim to a nearby hospital. There he read Beylund North Dakota\u2019s\nimplied consent advisory, informing him that test refusal in these\ncircumstances is itself a crime. See N.\u00a0D. Cent. Code Ann.\n\u00a739\u201320\u201301(3)(a). Unlike the other two petitioners in these cases,\nBeylund agreed to have his blood drawn and analyzed. A nurse took a\nblood sample, which revealed a blood alcohol concentration of\n0.250%, more than three times the legal limit.Given the test results, Beylund\u2019s driver\u2019s license was suspended\nfor two years after an administrative hearing. Beylund appealed the\nhearing officer\u2019s decision to a North Dakota District Court,\nprincipally arguing that his consent to the blood test was coerced\nby the officer\u2019s warning that refusing to consent would itself be a\ncrime. The District Court rejected this argument, and Beylund again\nappealed.The North Dakota Supreme Court affirmed. In response to\nBeylund\u2019s argument that his consent was insufficiently voluntary\nbecause of the announced criminal penalties for refusal, the court\nrelied on the fact that its then-recentBirchfielddecision\nhad upheld the constitutionality of those penalties. 2015 ND 18,\n\u00b6\u00b614\u201315, 859 N.\u00a0W. 2d 403, 408\u2013409. The court also explained\nthat it had found consent offered by a similarly situated motorist\nto be voluntary,Statev.Smith, 2014 ND 152, 849\nN.\u00a0W. 2d 599. In that case, the court emphasized that North\nDakota\u2019s implied consent advisory was not misleading because it\ntruthfully related the penalties for refusal.Id.,at\n606.We granted certiorari in all three cases and consolidated them\nfor argument, see 577 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2015), in order to decide\nwhether motorists lawfully arrested for drunk driving may be\nconvicted of a crime or otherwise penalized for refusing to take a\nwarrantless test measuring the alcohol in their bloodstream.IIIAs our summary of the facts and proceedings in these three cases\nreveals, the cases differ in some respects. Petitioners Birchfield\nand Beylund were told that they were obligated to submit to a blood\ntest, whereas petitioner Bernard was informed that a breath test\nwas required. Birchfield and Bernard each refused to undergo a test\nand was convicted of a crime for his refusal. Beylund complied with\nthe demand for a blood sample, and his license was then suspended\nin an administrative proceeding based on test results that revealed\na very high blood alcohol level.Despite these differences, success for all three petitioners\ndepends on the proposition that the criminal law ordinarily may not\ncompel a motorist to submit to the taking of a blood sample or to a\nbreath test unless a warrant authorizing such testing is issued by\na magistrate. If, on the other hand, such warrantless searches\ncomport with the Fourth Amendment, it follows that a State may\ncriminalize the refusal to comply with a demand to submit to the\nrequired testing, just as a State may make it a crime for a person\nto obstruct the execution of a valid search warrant. See,e.g.,Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a754\u201333d (2009); Fla. Stat. \u00a7933.15\n(2015); N.\u00a0J. Stat. Ann. \u00a733:1\u201363 (West 1994);18\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71501; cf.Bumperv.North\nCarolina,391 U.\u00a0S. 543,550 (1968) (\u201cWhen a law enforcement\nofficer claims authority to search a home under a warrant, he\nannounces in effect that the occupant has no right to resist the\nsearch\u201d). And by the same token, if such warrantless searches are\nconstitutional, there is no obstacle under federal law to the\nadmission of the results that they yield in either a criminal\nprosecution or a civil or administrative proceeding. We therefore\nbegin by considering whether the searches demanded in these cases\nwere consistent with the Fourth Amendment.IVThe Fourth Amendment provides:\u201cThe right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses,\npapers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures,\nshall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon\nprobable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly\ndescribing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to\nbe seized.\u201dThe Amendment thus prohibits \u201cunreasonable searches,\u201d and our\ncases establish that the taking of a blood sam-ple or the\nadministration of a breath test is a search.SeeSkinnerv.Railway Labor Executives\u2019 Assn.,489 U.\u00a0S. 602\u2013617\n(1989);Schmerberv.California,384 U.\u00a0S.\n757\u2013768 (1966). The question, then, is whether the warrantless\nsearches at issue here were reasonable. SeeVernonia School\nDist. 47Jv.Acton,515 U.\u00a0S. 646,652 (1995) (\u201cAs\nthe text of the Fourth Amendment indicates, the ultimate measure of\nthe constitutionality of a governmental search is\n\u2018reasonableness\u2019\u00a0\u201d).\u201c[T]he text of the Fourth Amendment does not specify when a\nsearch warrant must be obtained.\u201dKentuckyv.King,563 U.\u00a0S. 452,459 (2011); see alsoCaliforniav.Acevedo,500 U.\u00a0S. 565,581 (1991)\n(Scalia, J., concur-ring in judgment) (\u201cWhat [the text] explicitly\nstates regard-ing warrants is by way of limitation upon their\nissuance rather than requirement of their use\u201d). But \u201cthis Court\nhas inferred that a warrant must [usually] be secured.\u201dKing, 563 U.\u00a0S., at 459. This usual requirement,\nhowever, is subject to a number of exceptions.Ibid.We have previously had occasion to examine whether one such\nexception\u2014for \u201cexigent circumstances\u201d\u2014applies in drunk-driving\ninvestigations. The exigent circum-stances exception allows a\nwarrantless search when an emergency leaves police insufficient\ntime to seek a warrant.Michiganv.Tyler,436\nU.\u00a0S. 499,509 (1978). It permits, for instance, the\nwarrantless entry of private property when there is a need to\nprovide urgent aid to those inside, when police are in hot pursuit\nof a fleeing suspect, and when police fear the imminent destruction\nof evidence.King,supra,at 460.InSchmerberv.California, we held that drunk\ndrivingmaypresent such an exigency. There, an officer\ndirected hospital personnel to take a blood sample from a driver\nwho was receiving treatment for car crash injuries. 384 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 758. The Court concluded that the officer \u201cmight reasonably have\nbelieved that he was confronted with an emergency\u201d that left no\ntime to seek a warrant because \u201cthe percentage of alcohol in the\nblood begins to diminish shortly after drinking stops.\u201dId.,at 770. On the specific facts of that case, where time had already\nbeen lost taking the driver to the hospital and investigating the\naccident, the Court found no Fourth Amendment violation even though\nthe warrantless blood draw took place over the driver\u2019s objection.Id.,at 770\u2013772.More recently, though, we have held that the natural dissipation\nof alcohol from the bloodstream does notalwaysconstitute\nan exigency justifying the warrantless taking of a blood sample.\nThat was the holding ofMissouriv.McNeely, 569\nU.\u00a0S. ___, where the State of Missouri was seeking aper\u00a0serule that \u201cwhenever an officer has probable\ncause to believe an individual has been driving under the influence\nof alcohol, exigent circumstances will necessarily exist because\nBAC evidence is inherently evanescent.\u201dId.,at ___ (opinion\nof the Court) (slip op., at 8). We disagreed, emphasizing thatSchmerberhad adopted a case-specific analysis depending on\n\u201call of the facts and circumstances of the particular case.\u201d 569\nU.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 8). We refused to \u201cdepart from\ncareful case-by-case assessment of exigency and adopt the\ncategorical rule proposed by the State.\u201dId.,at ___ (slip\nop., at 9).While emphasizing that the exigent-circumstances exception must\nbe applied on a case-by-case basis, theMcNeelyCourt noted\nthat other exceptions to the warrant requirement \u201capply\ncategorically\u201d rather than in a \u201ccase-specific\u201d fashion.Id.,at ___, n. 3 (slip op., at 7, n.\u00a03). One of these,\nas theMcNeelyopinion recognized, is the long-established\nrule that a warrantless search may be conducted incident to a\nlawful arrest. Seeibid. But the Court pointedly did not\naddress any potential justification for warrantless testing of\ndrunk-driving suspects except for the exception \u201cat issue in th[e]\ncase,\u201d namely, the exception for exigent circumstances.Id.,at ___ (slip op., at 5). Neither did any of the Justices who wrote\nseparately. Seeid.,at ___\u2013___ (Kennedy, J., concurring in\npart)(slip op., at 1\u20132);id.,at ___\u2013___ (Roberts,\nC.\u00a0J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (slip op.,\nat 1\u201311);id.,at ___\u2013___ (Thomas, J., dissenting) (slip\nop., at 1\u20138).In the three cases now before us, the drivers were searched or\ntold that they were required to submit to a search after being\nplaced under arrest for drunk driving. We therefore consider how\nthe search-incident-to-arrest doctrine applies to breath and blood\ntests incident to such arrests.VAThe search-incident-to-arrest doctrine has an ancient pedigree.\nWell before the Nation\u2019s founding, it was recognized that officers\ncarrying out a lawful arrest had the authority to make a\nwarrantless search of the arrestee\u2019s person. An 18th-century manual\nfor justices of the peace provides a representative picture of\nusual practice shortly before the Fourth Amendment\u2019s adoption:\u201c[A] thorough search of the felon is of the utmost consequence\nto your own safety, and the benefit of the public, as by this means\nhe will be deprived of instruments of mischief, and evidence may\nprobably be found on him sufficient to convict him, of which, if he\nhas either time or opportunity allowed him, he will besure [sic] to\nfind some means to get rid of.\u201d The Conductor Generalis 117 (J.\nParker ed. 1788) (reprinting S. Welch, Observations on the Office\nof Constable 19 (1754)).One Fourth Amendment historian has observed that, prior to\nAmerican independence, \u201c[a]nyone arrested could expect that not\nonly his surface clothing but his body, luggage, and saddlebags\nwould be searched and, perhaps, his shoes, socks, and mouth as\nwell.\u201d W. Cuddihy, The Fourth Amendment: Origins and Original\nMeaning: 602\u20131791, p. 420 (2009).No historical evidence suggests that the Fourth Amendment\naltered the permissible bounds of arrestee searches. On the\ncontrary, legal scholars agree that \u201cthe legitimacy of body\nsearches as an adjunct to the arrest process had been thoroughly\nestablished in colonial times, so much so that their\nconstitutionality in 1789 can not be doubted.\u201dId.,at 752;\nsee also T. Taylor, Two Studies in Constitutional Interpretation\n28\u201329, 39, 45 (1969); Stuntz, The Substantive Origins of Criminal\nProcedure, 105 Yale L.\u00a0J. 393, 401 (1995).Few reported cases addressed the legality of such searches\nbefore the 19th century, apparently because the point was not much\ncontested. In the 19th century, the subject came up for discussion\nmore often, but court decisions and treatises alike confirmed the\nsearches\u2019 broad acceptance.E.g., Holkerv.Hennessey, 141 Mo. 527, 539\u2013540, 42 S.\u00a0W. 1090, 1093\n(1897);Ex\u00a0parte Hurn, 92 Ala. 102, 112, 9 So. 515, 519\n(1891);Thatcherv.Weeks, 79 Me. 547, 548\u2013549, 11 A.\n599 (1887);Reifsnyderv.Lee, 44 Iowa 101, 103\n(1876); F. Wharton, Criminal Pleading and Practice \u00a760, p. 45 (8th\ned. 1880); 1 J. Bishop, Criminal Procedure \u00a7211, p. 127 (2d ed.\n1872).When this Court first addressed the question, we too confirmed\n(albeit in dicta) \u201cthe right on the part of the Government, always\nrecognized under English and American law, to search the person of\nthe accused when legally arrested to discover and seize the fruits\nor evidence of crime.\u201dWeeksv.United States,232\nU.\u00a0S. 383,392 (1914). The exception quickly became a fixture\nin our Fourth Amendment case law. But in the decades that followed,\nwe grappled repeatedly with the question of the authority of\narresting officers to search the area surrounding the arrestee, and\nour decisions reached results that were not easy to reconcile. See,e.g., United Statesv.Lefkowitz,285 U.\u00a0S.\n452,464 (1932) (forbidding \u201cunrestrained\u201d search of room where\narrest was made);Harrisv.United States,331\nU.\u00a0S. 145,149,152 (1947) (permitting complete search of\narrestee\u2019s four-room apartment);United Statesv.Rabinowitz,339 U.\u00a0S. 56\u201365 (1950) (permitting complete\nsearch of arrestee\u2019s office).We attempted to clarify the law regarding searches incident to\narrest inChimelv.California,395 U.\u00a0S. 752,754\n(1969), a case in which officers had searched the arrestee\u2019s entire\nthree-bedroom house.Chimelendorsed a general rule that\narresting officers, in order to prevent the arrestee from obtaining\na weapon or destroying evidence, could search both \u201cthe person\narrested\u201d and \u201cthe area \u2018within his immediate control.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId.,at 763. \u201c[N]o comparable justification,\u201d we said,\nsupported \u201croutinely searching any room other than that in which an\narrest occurs\u2014or, for that matter, for searching through all the\ndesk drawers or other closed or concealed areas in that room\nitself.\u201dIbid.Four years later, inUnited Statesv.Robinson,414\nU.\u00a0S. 218 (1973), we elaborated onChimel\u2019s meaning. We\nnoted that the search-incident-to-arrest rule actually comprises\n\u201ctwo distinct propositions\u201d: \u201cThe first is that a search may be\nmade of thepersonof the arrestee by virtue of the lawful\narrest. The second is that a search may be made of the area within\nthe control of the arrestee.\u201d 414 U.\u00a0S., at 224. After a\nthorough review of the relevant common law history, we repudiated\n\u201ccase-by-case adjudication\u201d of the question whether an arresting\nofficer had the authority to carry out a search of the arrestee\u2019s\nperson.Id.,at 235. The permissibility of such searches, we\nheld, does not depend on whether a search of aparticulararrestee is likely to protect officer safety or evidence: \u201cThe\nauthority to search the person incident to a lawful custodial\narrest, while based upon the need to disarm and to discover\nevidence, does not depend on what a court may later decide was the\nprobability in a particular arrest situation that weapons or\nevidence would in fact be found upon the person of the suspect.\u201dIbid.Instead, the mere \u201cfact of the lawful arrest\u201d\njustifies \u201ca full search of the person.\u201dIbid.InRobinsonitself, that meant that police had acted\npermissibly in searching inside a package of cigarettes found on\nthe man they arrested.Id.,at 236.Our decision two Terms ago inRileyv.California,\n573 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2014), reaffirmed \u201cRobinson\u2019s\ncategorical rule\u201d and explained how the rule should be applied in\nsituations that could not have been envisioned when the Fourth\nAmendment was adopted.Id.,at ___ (slip op., at 9).Rileyconcerned a search of data contained in the memory of\na modern cell phone. \u201cAbsent more precise guidance from the\nfounding era,\u201d the Court wrote, \u201cwe generally determine whether to\nexempt a given type of search from the warrant requirement \u2018by\nassessing, on the one hand, the degree to which it intrudes upon an\nindividual\u2019s privacy and, on the other, the degree to which it is\nneeded for the promotion of legitimate governmental\ninterests.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIbid.Blood and breath tests to measure blood alcohol concentration\nare not as new as searches of cell phones, but here, as inRiley, the founding era does not provide any definitive\nguidance as to whether they should be allowed incident to\narrest.[3] Lacking such guidance, we engage in\nthe same mode of analysis as inRiley: we examine \u201cthe\ndegree to which [they] intrud[e] upon an individual\u2019s privacy and\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. the degree to which [they are] needed for the\npromotion of legitimate governmental interests.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIbid.BWe begin by considering the impact of breath and blood tests on\nindividual privacy interests, and we will discuss each type of test\nin turn.1Years ago we said that breath tests do not \u201cimplicat[e]\nsignificant privacy concerns.\u201dSkinner, 489 U. S., at 626.\nThat remains so today.First, the physical intrusion is almost negligible. Breath tests\n\u201cdo not require piercing the skin\u201d and entail \u201ca minimum of\ninconvenience.\u201dId.,at 625. As Minnesota describes its\nversion of the breath test, the process requires the arrestee to\nblow continuously for 4 to 15 seconds into a straw-like mouthpiece\nthat is connected by a tube to the test machine. Brief for\nRespondent in No. 14\u20131470, p. 20. Independent sources describe\nother breath test devices in essentially the same terms. Seesupra,at 5. The effort is no more demanding than blowing up\na party balloon.Petitioner Bernard argues, however, that the process is\nnevertheless a significant intrusion because the arrestee must\ninsert the mouthpiece of the machine into his or her mouth. Reply\nBrief in No. 14\u20131470, p. 9. But there is nothing painful or strange\nabout this requirement. The use of a straw to drink beverages is a\ncommon practice and one to which few object.Nor, contrary to Bernard, is the test a significant intrusion\nbecause it \u201cdoes not capture an ordinary exhalation of the kind\nthat routinely is exposed to the public\u201d but instead\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018requires a sample of \u201calveolar\u201d (deep lung) air.\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nBrief for Petitioner in No. 14\u20131470, p. 24. Humans have never been\nknown to assert a possessory interest in or any emotional\nattachment toanyof the air in their lungs. The air that\nhumans exhale is not part of their bodies. Exhalation is a natural\nprocess\u2014indeed, one that is necessary for life. Humans cannot hold\ntheir breath for more than a few minutes, and all the air that is\nbreathed into a breath analyzing machine, including deep lung air,\nsooner or later would be exhaled even without the test. See\ngener-ally J. Hall, Guyton and Hall Textbook of Medical Physiology\n519\u2013520 (13th ed. 2016).In prior cases, we have upheld warrantless searches involving\nphysical intrusions that were at least as significant as that\nentailed in the administration of a breath test. Just recently we\ndescribed the process of collecting a DNA sample by rubbing a swab\non the inside of a person\u2019s cheek as a \u201cnegligible\u201d intrusion.Marylandv.King, 569 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2013)\n(slip op., at 8). We have also upheld scraping underneath a\nsuspect\u2019s fingernails to find evidence of a crime, calling that a\n\u201cvery limited intrusion.\u201dCuppv.Murphy,412\nU.\u00a0S. 291,296 (1973). A breath test is no more intrusive than\neither of these procedures.Second, breath tests are capable of revealing only one bit of\ninformation, the amount of alcohol in the subject\u2019s breath. In this\nrespect, they contrast sharply with the sample of cells collected\nby the swab inMarylandv.King. Although the DNA\nobtained under the law at issue in that case could lawfully be used\nonly for identification pur-poses, 569 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 5), the process put into the possession of law enforcement\nauthorities a sample from which a wealth of additional, highly\npersonal information could potentially be obtained. A breath test,\nby contrast, results in a BAC reading on a machine, nothing more.\nNo sample of anything is left in the possession of the police.Finally, participation in a breath test is not an experience\nthat is likely to cause any great enhancement in the embarrassment\nthat is inherent in any arrest. SeeSkinner,supra,\nat 625 (breath test involves \u201ca minimum of .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nembarrassment\u201d). The act of blowing into a straw is not inherently\nembarrassing, nor are evidentiary breath tests administered in a\nmanner that causes embarrassment. Again, such tests are normally\nadministered in private at a police station, in a patrol car, or in\na mobile testing facility, out of public view. Seesupra,at\n5. Moreover, once placed under arrest, the individual\u2019s expectation\nof privacy is necessarily diminished.Marylandv.King,supra,at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 24\u201325).For all these reasons, we reiterate what we said inSkinner: A breath test does not \u201cimplicat[e] significant\nprivacy concerns.\u201d 489 U. S., at 626.2Blood tests are a different matter. They \u201crequire piercing the\nskin\u201d and extract a part of the subject\u2019s body.Skinner,supra,at 625; see alsoMcNeely, 569 U.\u00a0S., at\n___ (opinion of the Court) (slip op., at 4) (blood draws are \u201ca\ncompelled physical intrusion beneath [the defendant\u2019s] skin and\ninto his veins\u201d);id.,at ___ (opinion of Roberts,\nC.\u00a0J.) (slip op., at 9) (blood draws are \u201csignificant bodily\nintrusions\u201d). And while humans exhale air from their lungs many\ntimes per minute, humans do not continually shed blood. It is true,\nof course, that people voluntarily submit to the taking of blood\nsamples as part of a physical examination, and the process involves\nlittle pain or risk. Seeid.,at ___ (plurality opinion)\n(slip op., at 16) (citingSchmerber, 384 U.\u00a0S., at\n771). Nevertheless, for many, the process is not one they relish.\nIt is significantly more intrusive than blowing into a tube.\nPerhaps that is why many States\u2019 implied consent laws, including\nMinnesota\u2019s, specifically prescribe that breath tests be\nadministered in the usual drunk-driving case instead of blood tests\nor give motorists a measure of choice over which test to take. See\n1 Erwin \u00a74.06; Minn. Stat. \u00a7169A.51, subd. 3.In addition, a blood test, unlike a breath test, places in the\nhands of law enforcement authorities a sample that can be preserved\nand from which it is possible to extract information beyond a\nsimple BAC reading. Even if the law enforcement agency is precluded\nfrom testing the blood for any purpose other than to measure BAC,\nthe potential remains and may result in anxiety for the person\ntested.CHaving assessed the impact of breath and blood testing on\nprivacy interests, we now look to the States\u2019 asserted need to\nobtain BAC readings for persons arrested for drunk driving.1The States and the Federal Government have a \u201cparamount interest\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. in preserving the safety of .\u00a0.\u00a0. public\nhighways.\u201dMackeyv.Montrym,443 U.\u00a0S. 1,17\n(1979). Although the number of deaths and injuries caused by motor\nvehicle accidents has declined over the years, the statistics are\nstill staggering. See,e.g.,NHTSA, Traffic Safety Facts\n1995\u2014Overview 2 (No. 95F7, 1995) (47,087 fatalities, 3,416,000\ninjuries in 1988); NHTSA, Traffic Safety Facts, 2014 Data, Summary\nof Motor Vehicle Crashes 1 (No. 812263, May 2016) (Table 1) (29,989\nfatalities, 1,648,000 injuries in 2014).Alcohol consumption is a leading cause of traffic fatalities and\ninjuries. During the past decade, annual fatalities in\ndrunk-driving accidents ranged from 13,582 deaths in 2005 to 9,865\ndeaths in 2011. NHTSA, 2014 Alcohol-Impaired Driving 2. The most\nrecent data report a total of 9,967 such fatalities in 2014\u2014on\naverage, one death every 53 minutes.Id.,at 1. Our cases\nhave long recognized the \u201ccarnage\u201d and \u201cslaughter\u201d caused by drunk\ndrivers.Neville, 459 U.\u00a0S., at 558;Breithauptv.Abram,352 U.\u00a0S. 432,439 (1957).Justice Sotomayor\u2019s partial dissent suggests that States\u2019\ninterests in fighting drunk driving are satisfied once suspected\ndrunk drivers are arrested, since such arrests take intoxicated\ndrivers off the roads where they might do harm. Seepost,at\n9 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part). But of\ncourse States are not solely concerned with neutralizing the threat\nposed by a drunk driver who has already gotten behind the wheel.\nThey also have a compelling interest in creating effective\n\u201cdeterrent[s] to drunken driving\u201d so such individuals make\nresponsible decisions and do not become a threat to others in the\nfirst place.Mackey,supra,at 18.To deter potential drunk drivers and thereby reduce\nalcohol-related injuries, the States and the Federal Government\nhave taken the series of steps that we recounted earlier. Seesupra,at 2\u20138. We briefly recapitulate. After pegging\ninebriation to a specific level of blood alcohol, States passed\nimplied consent laws to induce motorists to submit to BAC testing.\nWhile these laws originally provided that refusal to submit could\nresult in the loss of the privilege of driving and the use of\nevidence of refusal in a drunk-driving prosecution, more recently\nStates and the Federal Government have concluded that these\nconsequences are insufficient. In particular, license suspension\nalone is unlikely to persuade the most dangerous offenders, such as\nthose who drive with a BAC significantly above the current limit of\n0.08% and recidivists, to agree to a test that would lead to severe\ncriminal sanctions. NHTSA, Implied Consent Refusal Impact, pp.\nxvii, 83 (No. 807765, Sept. 1991); NHTSA, Use of Warrants for\nBreath Test Refusal 1 (No. 810852, Oct. 2007). The laws at issue in\nthe present cases\u2014which make it a crime to refuse to submit to a\nBAC test\u2014are designed to provide an incentive to cooperate in such\ncases, and we conclude that they serve a very important\nfunction.2Petitioners and Justice Sotomayor contend that the States and\nthe Federal Government could combat drunk driving in other ways\nthat do not have the same impact on personal privacy. Their\narguments are unconvincing.The chief argument on this score is that an officer making an\narrest for drunk driving should not be allowed to administer a BAC\ntest unless the officer procures a search warrant or could not do\nso in time to obtain usable test results. The governmental interest\nin warrantless breath testing, Justice Sotomayor claims, turns on\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018whether the burden of obtaining a warrant is likely to\nfrustrate the governmental purpose behind the search.\u2019\u00a0\u201dPost,at 3\u20134 (quotingCamarav.Municipal Court of\nCity and County of San Francisco,387 U.\u00a0S. 523,533\n(1967)).This argument contravenes our decisions holding that the\nlegality of a search incident to arrest must be judged on the basis\nof categorical rules. InRobinson, for example, no one\nclaimed that the object of the search, a package of cigarettes,\npresented any danger to the arresting officer or was at risk of\nbeing destroyed in the time that it would have taken to secure a\nsearch warrant. The Court nevertheless upheld the constitutionality\nof a warrantless search of the package, concluding that a\ncategorical rule was needed to give police adequate guidance: \u201cA\npolice officer\u2019s determination as to how and where to search the\nperson of a suspect whom he has arrested is necessarily a quickad\u00a0hocjudgment which the Fourth Amendment does not\nrequire to be broken down in each instance into an analysis of each\nstep in the search.\u201d 414 U.\u00a0S., at 235; cf.Riley, 573\nU.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 22) (\u201cIf police are to have\nworkable rules, the balancing of the competing interests must in\nlarge part be done on a categorical basis\u2014not in an ad\u00a0hoc,\ncase-by-case fashion by individual police officers\u201d (brackets,\nellipsis, and internal quotation marks omitted)).It is not surprising, then, that the language Justice Sotomayor\nquotes to justify her approach comes not from our\nsearch-incident-to-arrest case law, but a case that addressed\nroutine home searches for possible housing code violations. SeeCamara, 387 U.\u00a0S., at 526.Camara\u2019s express\nconcern in the passage that the dissent quotes was \u201cwhether the\npublic interest demandscreationof a general exception to\nthe Fourth Amendment\u2019s warrant requirement.\u201dId.,at 533\n(emphasis added).Camaradidnotexplain how to apply\nan existing exception, let alone the long-established exception for\nsearches incident to a lawful arrest, whose applicability, asRobinsonandRileymake plain, has never turned on\ncase-specific variables such as how quickly the officer will be\nable to obtain a warrant in the particular circumstances he\nfaces.In advocating the case-by-case approach, petitioners and Justice\nSotomayor cite language in ourMcNeelyopinion. See Brief\nfor Petitioner in No. 14\u20131468, p.\u00a014;post,at 12. ButMcNeelyconcerned an exception to the warrant\nrequirement\u2014for exigent circumstances\u2014that always requires\ncase-by-case determinations. That was the basis for our decision in\nthat case. 569 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op.,at 9). Although Justice\nSotomayor contends that the categorical search-incident-to-arrest\ndoctrine and case-by-case exigent circumstances doctrine are\nactually parts of a single framework,post,at 6\u20137, and n.\n3, inMcNeelythe Court was careful to note that the\ndecision did not address any other exceptions to the warrant\nrequirement, 569 U.\u00a0S., at ___, n. 3 (slip op., at 7, n.\n3).Petitioners and Justice Sotomayor next suggest that requiring a\nwarrant for BAC testing in every case in which a motorist is\narrested for drunk driving would not impose any great burden on the\npolice or the courts. But of course the same argument could be made\nabout searching through objects found on the arrestee\u2019s possession,\nwhich our cases permit even in the absence of a warrant. What about\nthe cigarette package inRobinson? What if a motorist\narrested for drunk driving has a flask in his pocket? What if a\nmotorist arrested for driving while under the influence of\nmarijuana has what appears to be a mari-juana cigarette on his\nperson? What about an unmarked bottle of pills?If a search warrant were required for every search incident to\narrest that does not involve exigent circumstances, the courts\nwould be swamped. And even if we arbitrarily singled out BAC tests\nincident to arrest for this special treatment, as it appears the\ndissent would do, seepost,at 12\u201314, the impact on the\ncourts would be considerable. The number of arrests every year for\ndriving under the influence is enormous\u2014more than 1.1 million in\n2014. FBI, Uniform Crime Report, Crime in the United States, 2014,\nArrests 2 (Fall 2015). Particularly in sparsely populated areas, it\nwould be no small task for courts to field a large new influx of\nwarrant applications that could come on any day of the year and at\nany hour. In many jurisdictions, judicial officers have the\nauthority to issue warrants only within their own districts, see,e.g.,Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 41(b); N.\u00a0D. Rule Crim.\nProc. 41(a) (2016\u20132017), and in rural areas, some districts may\nhave only a small number of judicial officers.North Dakota, for instance, has only 51 state district judges\nspread across eight judicial districts.[4] Those\njudges are assisted by 31 magistrates, and there are no magistrates\nin 20 of the State\u2019s 53 counties.[5] At any given\nlocation in the State, then, relatively few state officials have\nauthority to issue search warrants.[6] Yet the\nState, with a population of roughly 740,000, sees nearly 7,000\ndrunk-driving arrests each year. Office of North Dakota Attorney\nGeneral, Crime in North Dakota, 2014, pp. 5, 47 (2015). With a\nsmall number of judicial officers authorized to issue warrants in\nsome parts of the State, the burden of fielding BAC warrant\napplications 24 hours per day, 365 days of the year would not be\nthe light burden that petitioners and Justice Sotomayor\nsuggest.In light of this burden and our prior search-incident-to-arrest\nprecedents, petitioners would at a minimum have to show some\nspecial need for warrants for BAC testing. It is therefore\nappropriate to consider the benefits that such applications would\nprovide. Search warrants protect privacy in two main ways. First,\nthey ensure that a search is not carried out unless a neutral\nmagistrate makes an independent determination that there is\nprobable cause to believe that evidence will be found. See,e.g., Riley, 573 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 5).\nSecond, if the magistrate finds probable cause, the warrant limits\nthe intrusion on privacy by specifying the scope of the search\u2014that\nis, the area that can be searched and the items that can be sought.United Statesv.Chadwick,433 U.\u00a0S. 1,9 (1977),\nabrogated on other grounds,Acevedo,500 U.\u00a0S. 565.How well would these functions be performed by the warrant\napplications that petitioners propose? In order to persuade a\nmagistrate that there is probable cause for a search warrant, the\nofficer would typically recite the same facts that led the officer\nto find that there was probable cause for arrest, namely, that\nthere is probable cause to believe that a BAC test will reveal that\nthe motorist\u2019s blood alcohol level is over the limit. As these\nthree cases suggest, see Part II,supra,the facts that\nestablish probable cause are largely the same from one\ndrunk-driving stop to the next and consist largely of the officer\u2019s\nown characterization of his or her observations\u2014for example, that\nthere was a strong odor of alcohol, that the motorist wobbled when\nattempting to stand, that the motorist paused when reciting the\nalphabet or counting backwards, and so on. A magistrate would be in\na poor position to challenge such characterizations.As for the second function served by search warrants\u2014delineating\nthe scope of a search\u2014the warrants in question here would not serve\nthat function at all. In every case the scope of the warrant would\nsimply be a BAC test of the arrestee. Cf.Skinner, 489\nU.\u00a0S., at 622 (\u201c[I]n light of the standardized nature of the\ntests and the minimal discretion vested in those charged with\nadministering the program, there are virtually no facts for a\nneutral magistrate to evaluate\u201d). For these reasons, requiring the\npolice to obtain a warrant in every case would impose a substantial\nburden but no commensurate benefit.Petitioners advance other alternatives to warrantless BAC tests\nincident to arrest, but these are poor substitutes. Relying on a\nrecent NHTSA report, petitioner Birchfield identifies 19 strategies\nthat he claims would be at least as effective as implied consent\nlaws, including high-visibility sobriety checkpoints, installing\nignition interlocks on repeat offenders\u2019 cars that would disable\ntheir operation when the driver\u2019s breath reveals a sufficiently\nhigh alcohol concentration, and alcohol treatment programs. Brief\nfor Petitioner in No. 14\u20131468, at 44\u201345. But Birchfield ignores the\nfact that the cited report describes many of these measures, such\nas checkpoints, as significantly more costly than test refusal\npenalties. NHTSA, A. Goodwin et\u00a0al., Countermeasures That\nWork: A Highway Safety Countermeasures Guide for State Highway\nSafety Offices, p.\u00a01\u20137 (No. 811727, 7th ed. 2013). Others,\nsuch as ignition interlocks, target only a segment of the\ndrunk-driver population. And still others, such as treatment\nprograms, are already in widespread use, seeid.,at 1\u20138,\nincluding in North Dakota and Minnesota. Moreover, the same NHTSA\nreport, in line with the agency\u2019s guidance elsewhere, stresses that\nBAC test refusal penalties would bemoreeffective if the\nconsequences for refusal were made more severe, including through\nthe addition of criminal penalties.Id.,at 1\u201316 to\n1\u201317.3Petitioner Bernard objects to the whole idea of analyzing breath\nand blood tests as searches incident to arrest. That doctrine, he\nargues, does not protect the sort of governmental interests that\nwarrantless breath and blood tests serve. On his reading, this\nCourt\u2019s precedents permit a search of an arrestee solely to prevent\nthe arrestee from obtaining a weapon or taking steps to destroy\nevidence. See Reply Brief in No. 14\u20131470, at 4\u20136. InChimel,\nfor example, the Court derived its limitation for the scope of the\npermitted search\u2014\u201cthe area into which an arrestee might reach\u201d\u2014from\nthe principle that officers may reasonably search \u201cthe area from\nwithin which he might gain possession of a weapon or destructible\nevidence.\u201d 395 U.\u00a0S., at 763. Stopping an arrestee from\ndestroying evidence, Bernard argues, is critically different from\npreventing the loss of blood alcohol evidence as the result of the\nbody\u2019s metabolism of alcohol, a natural process over which the\narrestee has little control. Reply Brief in No. 14\u20131470, at\n5\u20136.The distinction that Bernard draws between an arrestee\u2019s active\ndestruction of evidence and the loss of evidence due to a natural\nprocess makes little sense. In both situations the State is\njustifiably concerned that evidence may be lost, and Bernard does\nnot explain why the cause of the loss should be dispositive. And in\nfact many of this Court\u2019s post-Chimelcases have recognized\nthe State\u2019s concern, not just in avoiding an arrestee\u2019s intentional\ndestruction of evidence, but in \u201cevidence preservation\u201d or avoiding\n\u201cthe loss of evidence\u201d more generally.Riley, 573\nU.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 8); see alsoRobinson, 414\nU.\u00a0S., at 234 (\u201cthe need to preserve evidence on his person\u201d);Knowlesv.Iowa,525 U.\u00a0S. 113\u2013119 (1998) (\u201cthe\nneed to discover and preserve evidence;\u201d \u201cthe concern for\ndestructionor lossof evidence\u201d (emphasis added));Virginiav.Moore,553 U.\u00a0S. 164,176 (2008) (the\nneed to \u201csafeguard evidence\u201d). This concern for preserving evidence\nor preventing its loss readily encompasses the inevitable\nmetabolization of alcohol in the blood.Nor is there any reason to suspect thatChimel\u2019s use of\nthe word \u201cdestruction,\u201d 395 U.\u00a0S., at 763, was a deliberate\ndecision to rule out evidence loss that is mostly beyond the\narrestee\u2019s control. The case did not involve any evidence that was\nsubject to dissipation through natural processes, and there is no\nsign in the opinion that such a situation was on the Court\u2019s\nmind.Bernard attempts to derive more concrete support for his\nposition fromSchmerber. In that case, the Court stated that\nthe \u201cdestruction of evidence under the direct control of the\naccused\u201d is a danger that is not present \u201cwith respect to searches\ninvolving intrusions beyond the body\u2019s surface.\u201d 384 U.\u00a0S., at\n769. Bernard reads this to mean that an arrestee cannot be required\n\u201cto take a chemical test\u201d incident to arrest, Brief for Petitioner\nin No. 14\u20131470, at 19, but by using the term \u201cchemical test,\u201d\nBernard obscures the fact thatSchmerber\u2019s passage was\naddressed to the type of test at issue in that case, namely a blood\ntest. The Court described blood tests as \u201csearches involving\nintrusions beyond the body\u2019s surface,\u201d and it saw these searches as\nimplicating important \u201cinterests in human dignity and privacy,\u201d 384\nU.\u00a0S., at 769\u2013770. Al-though the Court appreciated as well\nthat blood tests \u201cin-volv[e] virtually no risk, trauma, or pain,\u201did.,at 771, its point was that such searches still impinge\non far more sensitive interests than the typical search of the\nperson of an arrestee. Cf.supra,at 22\u201323. But breath\ntests, unlike blood tests, \u201carenotinvasive of the body,\u201dSkinner, 489 U.\u00a0S., at 626 (emphasis added), and\ntherefore the Court\u2019s comments inSchmerberare inapposite\nwhen it comes to the type of test Bernard was asked to take.Schmerberdid not involve a breath test, and on the question\nof breath tests\u2019 legality,Schmerbersaid nothing.Finally, Bernard supports his distinction using a passage from\ntheMcNeelyopinion, which distinguishes between \u201ceasily\ndisposable evidence\u201d over \u201cwhich the suspect has control\u201d and\nevidence, like blood alcohol evidence, that is lost through a\nnatural process \u201cin a gradual and relatively predictable manner.\u201d\n569 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 10); see Reply Brief in No.\n14\u20131470, at 5\u20136. Bernard fails to note the issue that this\nparagraph addressed.McNeelyconcerned only one exception to\nthe usual warrant requirement, the exception for exigent\ncircumstances, and as previously discussed, that exception has\nalways been understood to involve an evaluation of the particular\nfacts of each case. Here, by contrast, we are concerned with the\nsearch-incident-to-arrest exception, and as we made clear inRobinsonand repeated inMcNeelyitself, this\nauthority is categorical. It does not depend on an evaluation of\nthe threat to officer safety or the threat of evidence loss in a\nparticular case.[7]Having assessed the effect of BAC tests on privacy interests and\nthe need for such tests, we conclude that the Fourth Amendment\npermits warrantless breath tests incident to arrests for drunk\ndriving. The impact of breath tests on privacy is slight, and the\nneed for BAC testing is great.We reach a different conclusion with respect to blood tests.\nBlood tests are significantly more intrusive, and their\nreasonableness must be judged in light of the availability of the\nless invasive alternative of a breath test. Respondents have\noffered no satisfactory justification for demanding the more\nintrusive alternative without awarrant.Neither respondents nor theiramicidispute the\neffectiveness of breath tests in measuring BAC. Breath tests have\nbeen in common use for many years. Their results are admissible in\ncourt and are widely credited by juries, and respondents do not\ndispute their accuracy or utility. What, then, is the justification\nfor warrantless blood tests?One advantage of blood tests is their ability to detect not just\nalcohol but also other substances that can impair a driver\u2019s\nability to operate a car safely. See Brief for New Jersey et al. asAmici Curiae9; Brief for United States asAmicus\nCuriae6. A breath test cannot do this, but police have other\nmeasures at their disposal when they have reason to believe that a\nmotorist may be under the influence of some other substance (for\nexample, if a breath test indicates that a clearly impaired\nmotorist has little if any alcohol in his blood). Nothing prevents\nthe police from seeking a warrant for a blood test when there is\nsufficient time to do so in the particular circumstances or from\nrelying on the exigent circumstances exception to the warrant\nrequirement when there is not. SeeMcNeely, 569 U.\u00a0S.,\nat ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 22\u201323).A blood test also requires less driver participation than a\nbreath test. In order for a technician to take a blood sample, all\nthat is needed is for the subject to remain still, either\nvoluntarily or by being immobilized. Thus, it is possible to\nextract a blood sample from a subject who forcibly resists, but\nmany States reasonably prefer not to take this step. See,e.g.,\nNeville, 459 U.\u00a0S., at 559\u2013560. North Dakota, for example,\ntells us that it generally opposes this practice because of the\nrisk of dangerous altercations between police officers and\narrestees in rural areas where the arresting officer may not have\nbackup. Brief for Respondent in No. 14\u20131468, p.\u00a029. Under\ncurrent North Dakota law, only in cases involving an accident that\nresults in death or serious injury may blood be taken from\narrestees who resist. Compare N.\u00a0D. Cent. Code Ann.\n\u00a7\u00a739\u201320\u201304(1), 39\u201320\u201301, with \u00a739\u201320\u201301.1.It is true that a blood test, unlike a breath test, may be\nadministered to a person who is unconscious (perhaps as a result of\na crash) or who is unable to do what is needed to take a breath\ntest due to profound intoxication or injuries. But we have no\nreason to believe that such situations are common in drunk-driving\narrests, and when they arise, the police may apply for a warrant if\nneed be.A breath test may also be ineffective if an arrestee\ndeliberately attempts to prevent an accurate reading by failing to\nblow into the tube for the requisite length of time or with the\nnecessary force. But courts have held that such conduct qualifies\nas a refusal to undergo testing,e.g., Andrewsv.Turner, 52 Ohio St. 2d 31, 36\u201337, 368 N.\u00a0E.\u00a02d\n1253, 1256\u20131257 (1977);In\u00a0re Kunneman, 501 P.\u00a02d\n910, 910\u2013911 (Okla. Civ. App. 1972); see generally 1 Erwin \u00a74.08[2]\n(collecting cases), and it may be prosecuted as such. And again, a\nwarrant for a blood test may be sought.Because breath tests are significantly less intrusive than blood\ntests and in most cases amply serve law enforcement interests, we\nconclude that a breath test, but not a blood test, may be\nadministered as a search incident to a lawful arrest for drunk\ndriving. As in all cases involving reasonable searches incident to\narrest, a warrant is not needed in this situation.[8]VIHaving concluded that the search incident to arrest doctrine\ndoes not justify the warrantless taking of a blood sample, we must\naddress respondents\u2019 alternative argument that such tests are\njustified based on the driver\u2019s legally implied consent to submit\nto them. It is well established that a search is reasonable when\nthe subject consents,e.g., Schnecklothv.Bustamonte,412 U.\u00a0S. 218,219 (1973), and that sometimes\nconsent to a search need not be express but may be fairly inferred\nfrom context, cf.Floridav.Jardines,569 U.\u00a0S.\n1, ___\u2013___ (2013) (slip op., at 6\u20137);Marshallv.Barlow\u2019s, Inc.,436 U.\u00a0S. 307,313 (1978). Our prior\nopinions have referred approvingly to the general concept of\nimplied-consent laws that impose civil penalties and evidentiary\nconsequences on motorists who refuse to comply. See,e.g.,McNeely,supra, at ___ (plural-ity opinion) (slip\nop., at 18);Neville,supra, at 560. Petitioners do\nnot question the constitutionality of those laws, and nothing we\nsay here should be read to cast doubt on them.It is another matter, however, for a State not only to insist\nupon an intrusive blood test, but also to impose criminal penalties\non the refusal to submit to such a test. There must be a limit to\nthe consequences to which motorists may be deemed to have consented\nby virtue of a decision to drive on public roads.Respondents and theiramiciall but concede this point.\nNorth Dakota emphasizes that its law makes refusal a misdemeanor\nand suggests that laws punishing refusal more severely would\npresent a different issue. Brief for Respondent in No. 14\u20131468, at\n33\u201334. Borrowing from our Fifth Amendment jurisprudence, the United\nStates suggests that motorists could be deemed to have consented to\nonly those conditions that are \u201creasonable\u201d in that they have a\n\u201cnexus\u201d to the privilege of driving and entail penalties that are\nproportional to severity of the violation. Brief for United States\nasAmicus Curiae21\u201327. But in the Fourth Amendment setting,\nthis standard does not differ in substance from the one that we\napply, since reasonableness is always the touchstone of Fourth\nAmendment analysis, seeBrigham Cityv.Stuart,547\nU.\u00a0S. 398,403 (2006). And applying this standard, we conclude\nthat motorists cannot be deemed to have consented to submit to a\nblood test on pain of committing a criminal offense.VIIOur remaining task is to apply our legal conclusions to the\nthree cases before us.Petitioner Birchfield was criminally prosecuted for refusing a\nwarrantless blood draw, and therefore the search he refused cannot\nbe justified as a search incident to his arrest or on the basis of\nimplied consent. There is no indication in the record or briefing\nthat a breath test would have failed to satisfy the State\u2019s\ninterests in acquiring evidence to enforce its drunk-driving laws\nagainst Birchfield. And North Dakota has not presented any\ncase-specific information to suggest that the exigent circumstances\nexception would have justified a warrantless search. Cf.McNeely, 569 U.\u00a0S., at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 20\u201323).\nUnable to see any other basis on which to justify a warrantless\ntest of Birchfield\u2019s blood, we conclude that Birchfield was\nthreatened with an unlawful search and that the judgment affirming\nhis conviction must bereversed.Bernard, on the other hand, was criminally prosecuted for\nrefusing a warrantless breath test. That testwasa\npermissible search incident to Bernard\u2019s arrest for drunk driving,\nan arrest whose legality Bernard has not con-tested. Accordingly,\nthe Fourth Amendment did not require officers to obtain a warrant\nprior to demanding the test, and Bernard had no right to refuse\nit.Unlike the other petitioners, Beylund was not prose-cuted for\nrefusing a test. He submitted to a blood test after police told him\nthat the law required his submission, and his license was then\nsuspended and he was fined in an administrative proceeding. The\nNorth Dakota Supreme Court held that Beylund\u2019s consent was\nvoluntary on the erroneous assumption that the State could\npermissibly compel both blood and breath tests. Because\nvoluntariness of consent to a search must be \u201cdetermined from the\ntotality of all the circumstances,\u201dSchneckloth,supra, at 227, we leave it to the state court on remand to\nreevaluate Beylund\u2019s consent given the partial inaccuracy of the\nofficer\u2019s advisory.[9]We accordingly reverse the judgment of the North Da-kota Supreme\nCourt in No. 14\u20131468 and remand the case for further proceedings\nnot inconsistent with this opinion. We affirm the judgment of the\nMinnesota Supreme Court in No. 14\u20131470. And we vacate the judgment\nof the North Dakota Supreme Court in No. 14\u20131507 and remand the\ncase for further proceedings not inconsistent with this\nopinion.It is so ordered.Notes1In addition, BAC may be determined by\ntesting a subject\u2019s urine, which also requires the test subject\u2019s\ncooperation. But urine tests appear to be less common in\ndrunk-driving cases than breath and blood tests, and none of the\ncases before us involves one.2See Smith, Moving From Grief to\nAction: Two Families Push for Stronger DUI Laws in N. D., Bismarck\nTribune, Feb. 2, 2013, p. 1A; Haga, Some Kind of Peace: Parents of\nTwo Young Boys Killed in Campground Accident Urge for Tougher DUI\nPenalties in N. D., Grand Forks Herald, Jan. 15, 2013, pp.\nA1\u2013A2.3At most, there may be evidence that\nan arrestee\u2019s mouth could be searched in appropriate circumstances\nat the time of the founding. See W. Cuddihy, Fourth Amendment:\nOrigins and Original Meaning: 602\u20131791, p. 420 (2009). Still,\nsearching a mouth for weapons or contraband is not the same as\nrequiring an arrestee to give up breath or blood.4See North Dakota Supreme Court, All\nDistrict Judges, http://www.ndcourts.gov/court/districts/judges.htm\n(all Internet materials as last visited June 21,\n2016).5See North Dakota Supreme Court,\nMagistrates,\nhttp://www.ndcourts.gov/court/counties/magistra/members.htm.6North Dakota Supreme Court justices\napparently also have author-ity to issue warrants statewide. See ND\nOp. Atty. Gen. 99\u2013L\u2013132, p. 2 (Dec. 30, 1999). But we highly doubt\nthat they regularly handle search-warrant applications, much less\nduring graveyard shifts.7Justice Sotomayor objects to treating\nwarrantless breath tests as searches incident to a lawful arrest on\ntwo additional grounds.8Justice Thomas partly dissents from\nthis holding, calling any distinction between breath and blood\ntests \u201can arbitrary line in the sand.\u201dPost,at 3 (opinion\nconcurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part). Adhering to\na position that the Court rejected inMcNeely, Justice\nThomas would hold that both breath and blood tests are\nconstitutional with or without a warrant because of the natural\nmetabolization of alcohol in the bloodstream.Post,at 3\u20135.\nYet Justice Thomas does not dispute our conclusions that blood\ndraws are more invasive than breath tests, that breath tests\ngenerally serve state interests in combating drunk driving as\neffectively as blood tests, and that our decision inRileycalls for a balancing of individual privacy interests and\nlegitimate state interests to determine the reasonableness of the\ncategory of warrantless search that is at issue. Contrary to\nJustice Thomas\u2019s contention, this balancing does not leave law\nenforcement officers or lower courts with unpredictable rules,\nbecause it is categorical andnot\u201ccase-by-case,\u201dpost,at 3. Indeed, today\u2019s decision provides very clear\nguidance that the Fourth Amendment allows warrantless breath tests,\nbut as a general rule does not allow warrantless blood draws,\nincident to a lawful drunk-driving arrest.9If the court on remand finds that\nBeylund did not voluntarily consent, it will have to address\nwhether the evidence obtained in the search must be suppressed when\nthe search was carried out pursuant to a state statute, seeHeienv.North Carolina, 574 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___\u2013___\n(2014) (slip op., at 8\u201310), and the evidence is offered in an\nadministrative rather than criminal proceeding, seePennsylvania\nBd. of Probation and Parolev.Scott,524 U.\u00a0S.\n357\u2013364 (1998). And as Beylund notes, remedies may be available to\nhim under state law. See Brief for Petitioner in No. 14\u20131507,\npp.\u00a013\u201314.",
