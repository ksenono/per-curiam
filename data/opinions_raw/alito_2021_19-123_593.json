This severe holding is ripe\nfor reexamination.IThere is no question thatSmith\u2019s\ninterpretation can have startling consequences. Here are a few\nexamples. Suppose that the Volstead Act, which implemented the\nProhibition Amendment, had not contained an exception for\nsacramental wine. See Pub. L. 66, \u00a73, 41Stat. 308\u2013309. The Act\nwould have been consistent withSmitheven though it would\nhave prevented the celebration of a Catholic Mass anywhere in the\nUnited States.[1] Or suppose\nthat a State, following the example of several European countries,\nmade it unlawful to slaughter an animal that had not first been\nrendered unconscious.[2] That\nlaw would be fine underSmitheven though it would outlaw\nkosher and halal slaughter.[3]\nOr suppose that a jurisdiction in this country, following the\nrecommendations of medical associations in Europe, banned the\ncircumcision of infants.[4] A\nSan Francisco ballot initiative in 2010 proposed just\nthat.[5] A categorical ban\nwould be allowed bySmitheven though it would prohibit an\nancient and important Jewish and Muslim practice.[6] Or suppose that this Court or some other\ncourt enforced a rigid rule prohibiting attorneys from wearing any\nform of head covering in court. The rule would satisfySmitheven though it would prevent Orthodox Jewish men, Sikh men, and\nmany Muslim women from appearing. Many other examples could be\nadded.We may hope that legislators and others with\nrule- making authority will not go as far asSmithallows,\nbut the present case shows that the dangers posed bySmithare not hypothetical. The city of Philadelphia (City) has issued an\nultimatum to an arm of the Catholic Church: Either engage in\nconduct that the Church views as contrary to the traditional\nChristian understanding of marriage or abandon a mission that dates\nback to the earliest days of the Church\u2014providing for the care of\norphaned and abandoned children.Many people believe they have a religious\nobligation to assist such children. Jews and Christians regard this\nas a scriptural command,[7] and\nit is a mission that the Catholic Church has undertaken since\nancient times. One of the first known orphanages is said to have\nbeen founded by St. Basil the Great in the fourth century,[8] and for centuries, the care of\norphaned and abandoned children was carried out by religious\norders.[9]In the New World, religious groups continued to\ntake the lead. The first known orphanage in what is now the United\nStates was founded by an order of Catholic nuns in New Orleans\naround 1729.[10] In the\n1730s, the first two orphanages in what became the United States at\nthe founding were established in Georgia by Lutherans and by Rev.\nGeorge Whitefield, a leader in the \u201cFirst Great\nAwakening.\u201d[11] In the late\n18th and early 19th centuries, Protestants and Catholics\nestablished orphanages in major cities. One of the first orphanages\nin Philadelphia was founded by a Catholic priest in 1798.[12] The Jewish Society for the\nRelief of Orphans and Children of Indigent Parents began its work\nin Charleston in 1801.[13]During the latter part of the 19th century and\ncontinuing into the 20th century, the care of children was shifted\nfrom orphanages to foster families,[14] but for many years, state and local government\nparticipation in this field was quite limited. As one of\nPhiladelphia\u2019samiciputs it, \u201c[i]nto the early twentieth\ncentury, the care of orphaned and abandoned children in the United\nStates remained largely in the hands of private charitable and\nreligious organizations.\u201d[15] In later years, an influx of federal money[16] spurred States and local\ngovernments to take a more active role, and today many governments\nadminister what is essentially a licensing system. As is typical in\nother jurisdictions, no private charitable group may recruit, vet,\nor support foster parents in Philadelphia without the City\u2019s\napproval.Whether with or without government\nparticipation, Catholic foster care agencies in Philadelphia and\nother cities have a long record of finding homes for children whose\nparents are unable or unwilling to care for them. Over the years,\nthey have helped thousands of foster children and parents, and they\ntake special pride in finding homes for children who are hard to\nplace, including older children and those with special\nneeds.[17]Recently, however, the City has barred Catholic\nSocial Services (CSS) from continuing this work. Because the\nCatholic Church continues to believe that marriage is a bond\nbetween one man and one woman, CSS will not vet same-sex couples.\nAs far as the record reflects, no same-sex couple has ever\napproached CSS, but if that were to occur, CSS would simply refer\nthe couple to another agency that is happy to provide that\nservice\u2014and there are at least 27 such agencies in Philadelphia.\nApp. 171; App. to Pet. for Cert. 137a; see alsoid.,at\n286a. Thus, not only is there no evidence that CSS\u2019s policy has\never interfered in the slightest with the efforts of a same-sex\ncouple to care for a foster child, there is no reason to fear that\nit would ever have that effect.None of that mattered to Philadelphia. When a\nnewspaper publicized CSS\u2019s policy, the City barred CSS from\ncontinuing its foster care work. Remarkably, the City took this\nstep even though it threatens the welfare of children awaiting\nplacement in foster homes. There is an acute shortage of foster\nparents, both in Philadelphia and in the country at large.[18] By ousting CSS, the City\neliminated one of its major sources of foster homes. And that\u2019s not\nall. The City went so far as to prohibit the placement of any\nchildren in homes that CSS had previously vetted and approved.\nExemplary foster parents like petitioners Sharonell Fulton and Toni\nLynn Simms-Busch are blocked from providing loving homes for\nchildren they were eager to help.[19] The City apparently prefers to risk leaving children\nwithout foster parents than to allow CSS to follow its religiously\ndictated policy, which threatens no tangible harm.CSS broadly implies that the fundamental\nobjective of City officials is to force the Philadelphia\nArchdiocese to change its position on marriage. Among other things,\nthey point to statements by a City official deriding the\nArchdiocese\u2019s position as out of step with Pope Francis\u2019s teaching\nand 21st century moral views.[20] But whether or not this is the City\u2019s real objective,\nthere can be no doubt that Philadelphia\u2019s ultimatum restricts CSS\u2019s\nability to do what it believes the Catholic faith requires.Philadelphia argues that its stance is allowed\nbySmithbecause, it claims, a City policy categorically\nprohibits foster care agencies from discriminating against same-sex\ncouples. Bound bySmith, the lower courts accepted this\nargument, 320 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d 661, 682\u2013684 (ED Pa. 2018), 922 F.3d\n140, 156\u2013159 (CA3 2019), and we then granted certiorari, 589\nU.\u00a0S. ___ (2020). One of the questions that we accepted for\nreview is \u201c[w]hetherEmployment Divisionv.Smithshould be revisited.\u201d We should confront that question.Regrettably, the Court declines to do so.\nInstead, it reverses based on what appears to be a superfluous (and\nlikely to be short-lived) feature of the City\u2019s standard annual\ncontract with foster care agencies.Smith\u2019s holding about\ncategorical rules does not apply if a rule permits individualized\nexemptions, 494 U. S., at 884, and the majority seizes on the\npresence in the City\u2019s standard contract of language giving a City\nofficial the power to grant exemptions.Ante, at 7. The City\ntells us that it has never granted such an exemption and has no\nintention of handing one to CSS, Brief for City Respondents 36;\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 168a, but the majority reverses the decision\nbelow because the contract supposedly confers that never-used\npower.Ante, at 10, 15.This decision might as well be written on the\ndissolving paper sold in magic shops. The City has been adamant\nabout pressuring CSS to give in, and if the City wants to get\naround today\u2019s decision, it can simply eliminate the never-used\nexemption power.[21] If it\ndoes that, then, voil\u00e0, today\u2019s decision will vanish\u2014and the\nparties will be back where they started. The City will claim that\nit is protected bySmith; CSS will argue thatSmithshould be overruled; the lower courts, bound bySmith, will\nreject that argument; and CSS will file a new petition in this\nCourt challengingSmith. What is the point of going around\nin this circle?Not only is the Court\u2019s decision unlikely to\nresolve the present dispute, it provides no guidance regarding\nsimilar controversies in other jurisdictions. From 2006 to 2011,\nCatholic Charities in Boston, San Francisco, Washington,\nD.\u00a0C., and Illinois ceased providing adoption or foster care\nservices after the city or state government insisted that they\nserve same-sex couples. Although the precise legal grounds for\nthese actions are not always clear, it appears that they were based\non laws or regulations generally prohibiting discrimination on the\nbasis of sexual orientation.[22] And some jurisdictions have adopted\nanti-discrimination rules that expressly target adoption\nservices.[23] Today\u2019s\ndecision will be of no help in other cases involving the exclusion\nof faith-based foster care and adoption agencies unless by some\nchance the relevant laws contain the same glitch as the\nPhiladelphia contractual provision on which the majority\u2019s decision\nhangs. The decision will be even less significant in all the other\nimportant religious liberty cases that are bubbling up.We should reconsiderSmithwithout\nfurther delay. The correct interpretation of the Free Exercise\nClause is a question of great importance, andSmith\u2019s\ninterpretation is hard to defend. It can\u2019t be squared with the\nordinary meaning of the text of the Free Exercise Clause or with\nthe prevalent understanding of the scope of the free-exercise right\nat the time of the First Amendment\u2019s adoption. It swept aside\ndecades of established precedent, and it has not aged well. Its\ninterpretation has been undermined by subsequent scholarship on the\noriginal meaning of the Free Exercise Clause. Contrary to what many\ninitially expected,Smithhas not provided a clear-cut rule\nthat is easy to apply, and experience has disproved theSmithmajority\u2019s fear that retention of the Court\u2019s prior\nfree-exercise jurisprudence would lead to \u201canarchy.\u201d 494\nU.\u00a0S., at 888.WhenSmithreinterpreted the Free\nExercise Clause, four Justices\u2014Brennan, Marshall, Blackmun, and\nO\u2019Connor\u2014registered strong disagreement.Id.,at 891, 892\n(O\u2019Connor, J., joined in part by Brennan, Marshall, and Blackmun,\nJJ., concurring in judgment);id.,at 907\u2013908 (Blackmun, J.,\njoined by Brennan and Marshall, JJ., dissenting). After joining the\nCourt, Justice Souter called forSmithto be reexamined.Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc.v.Hialeah,508 U.S.\n520, 559 (1993) (opinion concurring in part and concurring in\njudgment). So have five sitting Justices.Kennedyv.Bremerton School Dist., 586 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___\u2013___ (2019)\n(Alito, J., joined by Thomas, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh, JJ.,\nconcurring in denial of certiorari) (slip op., at 5\u20136);City of\nBoernev.Flores,521\nU.S. 507, 566 (1997) (Breyer, J., dissenting). So have some of\nthe country\u2019s most distinguished scholars of the Religion Clauses.\nSee,e.g.,McConnell, Free Exercise Revisionism and theSmithDecision, 57 U. Chi. L.\u00a0Rev. 1109 (1990)\n(McConnell, Free Exercise Revisionism); Laycock, The Supreme\nCourt\u2019s Assault on Free Exercise, and the Amicus Brief That Was\nNever Filed, 8 J. L. & Religion 99 (1990). On two separate\noccasions, Congress, with virtual unanimity, expressed the view\nthatSmith\u2019s interpretation is contrary to our society\u2019s\ndeep-rooted commitment to religious liberty. In enacting the\nReligious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993, 107Stat. 1488 (codified\nat 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72000bbet\u00a0seq.), and the\nReligious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000,\n114Stat. 803 (codified at 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72000ccet\u00a0seq.), Congress tried to restore the constitutional\nrule in place beforeSmithwas handed down. Those laws,\nhowever, do not apply to most state action, and they leave huge\ngaps.It is high time for us to take a fresh look at\nwhat the Free Exercise Clause demands.IIATo fully appreciate what the Court did inSmith, it is necessary to recall the substantial body of\nprecedent that it displaced. Our seminal decision on the question\nof religious exemptions from generally applicable laws wasSherbertv.Verner,374 U.S.\n398(1963), which had been in place for nearly four decades\nwhenSmithwas decided. In that earlier case, Adell\nSherbert, a Seventh-day Adventist, was fired because she refused to\nwork on Saturday, her Sabbath Day. 374 U.\u00a0S.,at 399.\nUnable to find other employment that did not require Saturday work,\nshe applied for unemployment compensation but was rejected because\nstate law disqualified claimants who \u201c\u00a0failed, without good\ncause .\u00a0.\u00a0. to accept available suitable work when\noffered.\u00a0\u201dId., at 399\u2013401, and n.\u00a03 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). The State Supreme Court held that this\ndenial of benefits did not violate Sherbert\u2019s free-exercise right,\nbut this Court reversed.In an opinion authored by Justice Brennan, the\nCourt began by surveying the Court\u2019s few prior cases involving\nclaims for religious exemptions from generally applicable laws.Id.,at 402\u2013403. In those decisions, the Court had not\narticulated a clear standard for resolving such conflicts, but as\ntheSherbertopinion accurately recounted, where claims for\nreligious exemptions had been rejected, \u201c[t]he conduct or actions\n[in question] invariably posed some substantial threat to public\nsafety, peace or order.\u201dId., at 403. (As will be shown\nbelow, this description of the earlier decisions corresponds\nclosely with the understanding of the scope of the free-exercise\nright at the time of the First Amendment\u2019s adoption. Seeinfra, at 29\u201336.)After noting these earlier decisions, the Court\nturned to the case at hand and concluded that the denial of\nbenefits imposed a substantial burden on Sherbert\u2019s free exercise\nof religion. 374 U.\u00a0S., at 404. It \u201cforce[d] her to choose\nbetween following the precepts of her religion and forfeiting\nbenefits, on the one hand, and abandoning one of the precepts of\nher religion in order to accept work, on the other hand.\u201dIbid. As a result, the Court reasoned, the decision below\ncould be sustained only if it was \u201cjustified by a \u2018compelling state\ninterest.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId., at 403, 406. The State argued that\nits law was needed to prevent \u201cthe filing of fraudulent claims by\nunscrupulous claimants feigning religious objections,\u201d but Justice\nBrennan\u2019s opinion found this justification insufficient because the\nState failed to show that \u201cno alternative forms of regulation would\ncombat such abuses without infringing First Amendment rights.\u201dId., at 407.The test distilled fromSherbert\u2014that a\nlaw that imposes a substantial burden on the exercise of religion\nmust be narrowly tailored to serve a compelling interest\u2014was the\ngoverning rule for the next 37 years. Applying that test, the Court\nsometimes vindicated free-exercise claims. InWisconsinv.Yoder,406 U.S.\n205, 234 (1972), for example, the Court held that a state law\nrequiring all students to remain in school until the age of 16\nviolated the free-exercise rights of Amish parents whose religion\nrequired that children leave school after the eighth grade. The\nCourt acknowledged the State\u2019s \u201cadmittedly strong interest in\ncompulsory education\u201d but concluded that the State had failed to\n\u201cshow with .\u00a0.\u00a0. particularity how [that interest] would\nbe adversely affected by granting an exemption to the Amish.\u201dId., at 236. And in holding that the Amish were entitled to\na special exemption, the Court expressly rejected the\ninterpretation of the Free Exercise Clause that was later embraced\ninSmith. Indeed, theYoderCourt stated this point\nagain and again: \u201c[T]here are areas of conduct protected by the\nFree Exercise Clause of the First Amendment and thus beyond the\npower of the State to control,even under regulations of general\napplicability\u201d;\u201c[a] regulation neutral on its face may, in\nits application, nonetheless offend the constitutional requirement\nfor governmental neutralityif it unduly burdens the free\nexercise of religion\u201d; insisting that Amish children abide by the\ncompulsory attendance requirement was unconstitutionaleven\nthough it \u201capplie[d] uniformly to all citizens of the Stateand\nd[id] not, on its face, discriminate against religions or a\nparticular religion, [and was] motivated by legitimate secular\nconcerns.\u201dId., at 220 (emphasis added).Other decisions also accepted free-exercise\nclaims under theSherberttest. InThomasv.Review Bd. of Ind. Employment Security Div.,450\nU.S. 707, 710, 720 (1981), the Court concluded that a State\ncould not withhold unemployment benefits from a Jehovah\u2019s Witness\nwho quit his job because he refused to do work that he viewed as\ncontributing to the production of military weapons. In so holding,\nthe Court reiterated that \u201c\u00a0\u2018[a] regulation neutral on its\nface may, in its application, nonetheless offend the constitutional\nrequirement for governmental neutrality if it unduly burdens the\nfree exercise of religion.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId., at 717 (quotingYoder, 406 U.\u00a0S., at 220).Subsequently, inHobbiev.Unemployment Appeals Comm\u2019n of Fla.,480\nU.S. 136, 141 (1987), the Court found that a state rule that\nwas \u201c\u00a0\u2018neutral and uniform in its application\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nnevertheless violated the Free Exercise Clause under theSherberttest. A similar violation was found inFrazeev.Illinois Dept. of Employment Security,489 U.S.\n829(1989).Other cases appliedSherbertbut found no\nviolation. InUnited Statesv.Lee,455\nU.S. 252, 258 (1982), the Court held that mandatory\ncontributions to Social Security were constitutional because they\nwere \u201cindispensable to the fiscal vitality of the social security\nsystem.\u201d InGillettev.United States,401\nU.S. 437, 462 (1971), denying conscientious-objector status to\nmen whose opposition to war was limited to one particular conflict\nwas held to be \u201cstrictly justified by substantial governmental\ninterests.\u201d In still other cases, the Court foundSherbertinapplicable either because the challenged law did not implicate\nthe conduct of the individual seeking an exemption, seeBowenv.Roy,476 U.S.\n693, 700 (1986);Lyngv.Northwest Indian Cemetery\nProtective Assn.,485\nU.S. 439, 450\u2013451 (1988), or because the case arose in a\ncontext where the government exercised broader authority over\nassertions of individual rights, seeO\u2019Lonev.Estate of\nShabazz,482 U.S.\n342, 353 (1987) (prison);Goldmanv.Weinberger,475 U.S.\n503, 506 (1986) (military). None of these decisions questioned\nthe validity ofSherbert\u2019s interpretation of the\nfree-exercise right.BThis is where our case law stood whenSmithreached the Court. The underlying situation inSmithwas very similar to that inSherbert. Just as\nAdell Sherbert had been denied unemployment benefits due to conduct\nmandated by her religion (refraining from work on Saturday), Alfred\nSmith and Galen Black were denied unemployment benefits because of\na religious practice (ingesting peyote as part of a worship service\nof the Native American Church). 494 U.\u00a0S., at 874. Applying\ntheSherberttest, the Oregon Supreme Court held that this\ndenial of benefits violated Smith\u2019s and Black\u2019s free-exercise\nrights, and this Court granted review.[24]The State defended the denial of benefits under\ntheSherbertframework. It argued that it had a compelling\ninterest in combating the use of dangerous drugs and that\naccommodating their use for religious purposes would upset its\nenforcement scheme. Brief for Petitioners inEmployment Div.,\nDept. of Human Resourcesv.Smith, No. 88\u20131213,\nO.\u00a0T. 1988, pp. 5\u20137, 12, 16. The State never suggested thatSherbertshould be overruled. See Brief for Petitioners in\nNo. 88\u20131213, at 11. Instead, the crux of its disagreement with\nSmith and Black and the State Supreme Court was whether its\ninterest in preventing drug use could be served by a more narrowly\ntailored rule that made an exception for religious use by members\nof the Native American Church.The question divided the four Justices who\nobjected to theSmithmajority\u2019s rationale. Compare 494\nU.\u00a0S., at 905\u2013907 (O\u2019Connor J., concurring in judgment), withid.,at 909\u2013919 (Blackmun, J., joined by Brennan and\nMarshall, JJ., dissenting). And theSmithmajority wanted no\npart of that question. Instead, without briefing or argument on\nwhetherSherbertshould be cast aside, the Court adopted\nwhat it seems to have thought was a clear-cut test that would be\neasy to apply: A \u201cgenerally applicable and otherwise valid\u201d rule\ndoes not violate the Free Exercise Clause \u201cif prohibiting the\nexercise of religion .\u00a0.\u00a0. is not [its] object\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. but merely the incidental effect of\u00a0\u201d its\noperation. 494 U.\u00a0S., at 878. Other than cases involving rules\nthat target religious conduct, theSherberttest was held to\napply to only two narrow categories of cases: (1) those involving\nthe award of unemployment benefits or other schemes allowing\nindividualized exemptions and (2) so-called \u201chybrid rights\u201d cases.\nSee 494 U.\u00a0S., at 881\u2013884.[25]To clear the way for this new regime, the\nmajority was willing to take liberties. Paying little attention to\nthe terms of the Free Exercise Clause, it was satisfied that its\ninterpretation represented a \u201cpermissible\u201d reading of the text,Smith, 494 U.\u00a0S., at 878, and it did not even stop to\nexplain why that was so. The majority made no effort to ascertain\nthe original understanding of the free-exercise right, and it\nlimited past precedents on grounds never previously suggested.Sherbert,Thomas, andHobbiewere placed in a\nspecial category because they concerned the award of unemployment\ncompensation,Smith, 494 U.\u00a0S., at 883, andYoderwas distinguished on the ground that it involved both\na free-exercise claim and a parental-rights claim,Smith,494 U.\u00a0S., at 881. Not only did these distinctions lack\nsupport in prior case law, the issue inSmithitself could\neasily be viewed as falling into both of these special categories.\nAfter all, it involved claims for unemployment benefits, and\nmembers of the Native American Church who ingest peyote as part of\na religious ceremony are surely engaging in expressive conduct that\nfalls within the scope of the Free Speech Clause. See,e.g.,Texasv.Johnson,491 U.S.\n397, 404 (1989).None of these obstacles stopped theSmithmajority from adopting its new rule and displacing decades of\nprecedent. The majority feared that continued adherence to that\ncase law would \u201ccour[t] anarchy\u201d because it \u201cwould open the\nprospect of constitutionally required religious exemptions from\ncivic obligations of almost every conceivable kind.\u201d 494\nU.\u00a0S., at 888. The majority recognized that its new\ninterpretation would place small religious groups at a \u201crelative\ndisadvantage,\u201d but the majority found that preferable to the\nproblems it envisioned if theSherberttest had been\nretained.494 U.\u00a0S., at 890.Four Justices emphatically disagreed withSmith\u2019s reinterpretation of the Free Exercise Clause.\nJustice O\u2019Connor wrote that this new reading \u201cdramatically\ndepart[ed] from well-settled First Amendment jurisprudence\u201d and was\n\u201cincompatible with our Nation\u2019s fundamental commitment to\nindividual religious liberty.\u201d 494 U.\u00a0S., at 891 (opinion\nconcurring in judgment). Justices Brennan, Marshall, and Blackmun\nprotested that the majority had \u201cmischaracteriz[ed]\u201d and\n\u201cdiscard[ed]\u201d the Court\u2019s free-exercise jurisprudence on its way to\n\u201cperfunctorily dismiss[ing]\u201d the \u201csettled and inviolate principle\u201d\nthat state laws burdening religious freedom may stand only if\n\u201cjustified by a compelling interest that cannot be served by less\nrestrictive means.\u201dId.,at 907\u2013908 (Blackmun, J., joined by\nBrennan and Marshall, JJ., dissenting).Smith\u2019s impact was quickly felt, and\nCongress was inundated with reports of the decision\u2019s\nconsequences.[26] In\nresponse, it attempted to restore theSherberttest. In the\nHouse, then-Representative Charles Schumer introduced a bill that\nmade a version of that test applicable to all actions taken by the\nFederal Government or the States. H.\u00a0R. 1308, 103d Cong., 1st\nSess. (1993). This bill, which eventually became the Religious\nFreedom Restoration Act (RFRA), passed in the House without\ndissent, was approved in the Senate by a vote of 97 to 3, and was\nenthusiastically signed into law by President Clinton. 139 Cong.\nRec. 27239\u201327341 (1993) (House voice vote);id., at 26416\n(Senate vote); Remarks on Signing the Religious Freedom Restoration\nAct of 1993, 29 Weekly Comp. of Pres. Doc. 2377 (1993). And when\nthis Court later held inCity of Boerne,521 U.S.\n507, that Congress lacked the power under the 14th Amendment to\nimpose these rules on the States, Congress responded by enacting\nthe Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA)\nunder its spending power and its power to regulate interstate\ncommerce. See 114Stat. 803. Introduced in the Senate by Sen. Orrin\nHatch and cosponsored by Sen. Edward Kennedy, RLUIPA imposed the\nsame rules as RFRA on land use and prison regulations. S. 2869,\n106th Cong., 2d Sess. (2000); 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72000ccet\nseq; 146 Cong. Rec. 16698 (2000). RLUIPA passed both Houses of\nCongress without a single negative vote and, like RFRA, was signed\nby President Clinton.Id., at 16703, 16623; Statement on\nSigning the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of\n2000, 36 Weekly Comp. of Pres. Doc. 2168 (2000).RFRA and RLUIPA have restored part of the\nprotection thatSmithwithdrew, but they are both limited in\nscope and can be weakened or repealed by Congress at any time. They\nare no substitute for a proper interpretation of the Free Exercise\nClause.IIIAThat project must begin with the\nconstitutional text. InMartinv.Hunter\u2019s Lessee, 1\nWheat. 304, 338\u2013339 (1816), Justice Story laid down the guiding\nprinciple: \u201cIf the text be clear and distinct, no restriction upon\nits plain and obvious import ought to be admitted, unless the\ninference be irresistible.\u201d And even though we now have a thick\nbody of precedent regarding the meaning of most provisions of the\nConstitution, our opinions continue to respect the primacy of the\nConstitution\u2019s text. See,e.g.,Chiafalov.Washington, 591 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___\u2013___ (2020) (slip op., at\n9\u201313) (starting with the text of Art. II, \u00a71, before considering\nhistorical practice);Knickv.Township of Scott, 588\nU.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2019) (slip op., at 6) (beginning analysis\nwith the text of the Takings Clause);Gamblev.United\nStates, 587 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___\u2013___ (2019) (slip op., at 3\u20134)\n(starting with the text of the Fifth Amendment before turning to\nhistory and precedent);City of Boerne, 521 U.\u00a0S., at\n519 (\u201cIn assessing the breadth of \u00a75\u2019s enforcement power, we begin\nwith its text\u201d).Smith,however, paid shockingly little\nattention to the text of the Free Exercise Clause. Instead of\nexamining what readers would have understood its words to mean when\nadopted, the opinion merely asked whether it was \u201cpermissible\u201d to\nread the text to have the meaning that the majority favored. 494\nU.\u00a0S., at 878. This strange treatment of the constitutional\ntext cannot be justified\u2014and is especially surprising since it\nclashes so sharply with the way in whichSmith\u2019s author,\nJustice Scalia, generally treated the text of the Constitution\n(and, indeed, with his entire theory of legal interpretation). As\nhe put it, \u201cWhat I look for in the Constitution is precisely what I\nlook for in a statute:\u00a0the original meaning of the text.\u201d A.\nScalia, A Matter of Interpretation 38 (1997). See alsoNLRBv.Noel Canning,573 U.S.\n513, 575\u2013583 (2014) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment);Stop the Beach Renourishment, Inc.v.Florida Dept. of\nEnvironmental Protection,560 U.S.\n702, 722 (2010) (plurality opinion of Scalia, J.);Marylandv.Craig,497 U.S.\n836, 860\u2013861 (1990) (Scalia, J., dissenting).Justice Scalia\u2019s opinion for the Court inDistrict of Columbiav.Heller,554 U.S.\n570(2008), is a prime example of his usual approach, and it is\na model of what a reexamination of the Free Exercise Clause should\nentail. InHeller, after observing that the \u201cConstitution\nwas written to be understood by the voters,\u201d Justice Scalia\u2019s\nopinion begins by presuming that the \u201cwords and phrases\u201d of the\nSecond Amendment carry \u201ctheir normal and ordinary .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nmeaning.\u201dId., at 576 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nThe opinion then undertakes a careful examination of all the\nAmendment\u2019s key terms. It does not simply ask whether its\ninterpretation of the text is \u201cpermissible.\u201dSmith, 494\nU.\u00a0S., at 878.BFollowing the sound approach that the Court\ntook inHeller, we should begin by considering the \u201cnormal\nand ordinary\u201d meaning of the text of the Free Exercise Clause:\n\u201cCongress shall make no law . . . prohibiting the free exercise [of\nreligion].\u201d Most of these terms and phrases\u2014\u201cCongress,\u201d[27] \u201cshall make,\u201d \u201cno law,\u201d[28] and \u201creligion\u201d[29]\u2014do not require discussion for present\npurposes, and we can therefore focus on what remains: the term\n\u201cprohibiting\u201d and the phrase \u201cthe free exercise of religion.\u201dThose words had essentially the same meaning in\n1791 as they do today. \u201cTo prohibit\u201d meant either \u201c[t]o forbid\u201d or\n\u201cto hinder.\u201d 2 S. Johnson, A Dictionary of the English Language\n(1755) (Johnson (1755)).[30]\nThe term \u201cexercise\u201d had both a broad primary definition\n(\u201c[p]ractice\u201d or \u201coutward performance\u201d) and a narrower secondary\none (an \u201c[a]ct of divine worship whether publick or private\u201d). 1id.[31] (The Court\nlong ago declined to give the First Amendment\u2019s reference to\n\u201cexercise\u201d this narrow reading. See,e.g.,Cantwellv.Connecticut,310 U.S.\n296, 303\u2013304 (1940).) And \u201cfree,\u201d in the sense relevant here,\nmeant \u201cunrestrained.\u201d 1 Johnson (1755).[32]If we put these definitions together, the\nordinary meaning of \u201cprohibiting the free exercise of religion\u201d was\n(and still is) forbidding or hindering unrestrained religious\npractices or worship. That straightforward understanding is a far\ncry from the interpretation adopted inSmith. It certainly\ndoes not suggest a distinction between laws that are generally\napplicable and laws that are targeted.As interpreted inSmith, the Clause is\nessentially an anti-discrimination provision: It means that the\nFederal Government and the States cannot restrict conduct that\nconstitutes a religious practice for some people unless it imposes\nthe same restriction on everyone else who engages in the same\nconduct.Smithmade no real attempt to square that\nequal-treatment interpretation with the ordinary meaning of the\nFree Exercise Clause\u2019s language, and it is hard to see how that\ncould be done.The key point for present purposes is that the\ntext of the Free Exercise Clause gives a specific group of people\n(those who wish to engage in the \u201cexercise of religion\u201d) the right\nto do so without hindrance. The language of the Clause does not tie\nthis right to the treatment of persons not in this group.The oddity ofSmith\u2019s interpretation can\nbe illustrated by considering what the same sort of interpretation\nwould mean if applied to other provisions of the Bill of Rights.\nTake the Sixth Amendment, which gives a specified group of people\n(the \u201caccused\u201d in criminal cases) a particular right (the right to\nthe \u201cAssistance of Counsel for [their] defence\u201d). Suppose that\nCongress or a state legislature adopted a law banning counsel inall litigation, civil and criminal. Would anyone doubt that\nthis law would violate the Sixth Amendment rights of criminal\ndefendants?Or consider the Seventh Amendment, which gives a\nspecified group of people (parties in most civil \u201cSuits at common\nlaw\u201d) \u201cthe right of trial by jury.\u201d Would there be any question\nthat a law abolishing juries inallcivil cases would\nviolate the rights of parties in cases that fall within the Seventh\nAmendment\u2019s scope?Other examples involving language similar to\nthat in the Free Exercise Clause are easy to imagine. Suppose that\nthe amount of time generally allotted to complete a state bar exam\nis 12 hours but that applicants with disabilities secure a consent\ndecree allowing them an extra hour. Suppose that the State later\nadopts a rule requiring all applicants to complete the exam in 11\nhours. Would anyone argue that this was consistent with the\ndecree?Suppose that classic car enthusiasts secure the\npassage of a state constitutional amendment exempting cars of a\ncertain age from annual safety inspections, but the legislature\nlater enacts a law requiring such inspections for all vehicles\nregardless of age. Can there be any doubt that this would violate\nthe state constitution?It is not necessary to belabor this point\nfurther. What all these examples show is thatSmith\u2019s\ninterpretation conflicts with the ordinary meaning of the First\nAmendment\u2019s terms.CIs there any way to bring about a\nreconciliation? The short answer is \u201cno.\u201d Survey all the briefs\nfiled in support of respondents (they total more than 40) and three\ndecades of law review articles, and what will you find?\nPhiladelphia\u2019s brief refers in passing to one possible argument\u2014and\nthe source it cites is a law review article by one ofSmith\u2019s leading academic critics, Professor Michael W.\nMcConnell. See Brief for City Respondents 49 (citing McConnell,\nFree Exercise Revisionism 1115). Trying to see if there was any way\nto makeSmithfit with the constitutional text, Professor\nMcConnell came up with this argument\u2014but then rejected it.\nMcConnell,Free Exercise Revisionism 1115\u20131116.The argument goes as follows: Even if a law\nprohibits conduct that constitutes an essential religious practice,\nit cannot be said to \u201cprohibit\u201d the free exercise of religion\nunless that was the lawmakers\u2019 specific object.This is a hair-splitting interpretation. It\ncertainly does not represent the \u201cnormal and ordinary\u201d meaning of\nthe Free Exercise Clause\u2019s terms. SeeHeller, 554\nU.\u00a0S., at 576. Consider how it would play out if applied to\nsome of the hypothetical laws discussed at the beginning of this\nopinion. A law categorically banning all wine would not \u201cprohibit\u201d\nthe celebration of a Catholic Mass? A law categorically forbidding\nthe slaughter of a conscious animal would not \u201cprohibit\u201d kosher and\nhalal slaughterhouses? A rule categorically banning any head\ncovering in a courtroom would not \u201cprohibit\u201d appearances by\northodox Jewish men, Sikh men, and Muslim women who wear hijabs? It\nis no wonder thatSmith\u2019s many defenders have almost\nuniformly foregone this argument.DNot only is it difficult to squareSmith\u2019s interpretation with the terms of the Free Exercise\nClause, the absence of any language referring to equal treatment is\nstriking. If equal treatment was the objective, why didn\u2019t Congress\nsay that? And since it would have been simple to cast the Free\nExercise Clause in equal-treatment terms, why would the state\nlegislators who voted for ratification have read the Clause that\nway?It is not as if there were no models that could\nhave been used. Other constitutional provisions contain\nnon-discrimination language. For example, Art. I, \u00a79, cl.\u00a06,\nprovides that \u201c[n]o Preference shall be given by any Regulation of\nCommerce or Revenue to the Ports of one State over those of\nanother.\u201d Under Art. IV, \u00a72, cl.\u00a01, \u201c[t]he Citizens of each\nState shall be entitled to all Privileges and Immunities of\nCitizens in the several States.\u201d Article V provides that \u201cno State,\nwithout its Consent, shall be deprived of its equal Suffrage in the\nSenate.\u201d Language mandating equal treatment of one sort or another\nalso appeared in the religious liberty provisions of colonial\ncharters and state constitutions.[33] But Congress eschewed those models. The contrast\nbetween these readily available anti-discrimination models and the\nlanguage that appears in the First Amendment speaks volumes.IVAWhile we presume that the words of the\nConstitution carry their ordinary and normal meaning, we cannot\ndisregard the possibility that some of the terms in the Free\nExercise Clause had a special meaning that was well understood at\nthe time.Heller, again, provides a helpful example.Hellerdid not hold that the right to keep and bear arms\nmeans that everyone has the right to keep and bear every type of\nweaponry in all places and at all times. Instead, it held that the\nSecond Amendment protects a known right that was understood to have\ndefined dimensions. 554 U.\u00a0S., at 626\u2013628.FollowingHeller\u2019s lead, we must ask\nwhether the Free Exercise Clause protects a right that was known at\nthe time of adoption to have defined dimensions. But in doing so,\nwe must keep in mind that there is a presumption that the words of\nthe Constitution are to be interpreted in accordance with their\n\u201cnormal and ordinary\u201d sense.Id., at 576 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). Anyone advocating a different reading must overcome\nthat presumption.B1What was the free-exercise right understood to\nmean when the Bill of Rights was ratified? And in particular, was\nit clearly understood that the right simply required equal\ntreatment for religious and secular conduct? WhenSmithwas\ndecided, scholars had not devoted much attention to the original\nmeaning of the Free Exercise Clause, and the parties\u2019 briefs\nignored this issue, as did the opinion of the Court. Since then,\nhowever, the historical record has been plumbed in detail,[34] and we are now in a good\nposition to examine how the free-exercise right was understood when\nthe First Amendment was adopted.By that date, the right to religious liberty\nalready had a long, rich, and complex history in this country. What\nappears to be the first \u201cfree exercise\u201d provision was adopted in\n1649. Prompted by Lord Baltimore,[35] the Maryland Assembly enacted a provision protecting\nthe right of all Christians to engage in \u201cthe free exercise\u201d of\nreligion.[36] Rhode Island\u2019s\n1663 Charter extended the right to all. See Charter of Rhode Island\nand Providence Plantations (1663), in Cogan 34. Early colonial\ncharters and agreements in Carolina, Delaware, New Jersey, New\nYork, and Pennsylvania also recognized the right to free\nexercise,[37] and by 1789,\nevery State except Connecticut had a constitutional provision\nprotecting religious liberty. McConnell, Origins 1455. In fact, the\nFree Exercise Clause had more analogs in State Constitutions than\nany other individual right. See Calabresi, Agudo, & Dore, State\nBills of Rights in 1787 and 1791: What Individual Rights Are Really\nDeeply Rooted in American History and Tradition? 85 S. Cal. L. Rev.\n1451, 1463\u20131464, 1472\u20131473 (2012). In all of those State\nConstitutions, freedom of religion enjoyed broad protection, and\nthe right \u201cwas universally said to be an unalienable right.\u201d\nMcConnell, Origins 1456.[38]2What was this right understood to protect? In\nseeking to discern that meaning, it is easy to get lost in the\nvoluminous discussion of religious liberty that occurred during the\nlong period from the first British settlements to the adoption of\nthe Bill of Rights. Many different political figures, religious\nleaders, and others spoke and wrote about religious liberty and the\nrelationship between the authority of civil governments and\nreligious bodies. The works of a variety of thinkers were\ninfluential, and views on religious liberty were informed by\nreligion, philosophy, historical experience, particular\ncontroversies and issues, and in no small measure by the practical\ntask of uniting the Nation. The picture is complex.For present purposes, we can narrow our focus\nand concentrate on the circumstances that relate most directly to\nthe adoption of the Free Exercise Clause. As has often been\nrecounted, critical state ratifying conventions approved the\nConstitution on the understanding that it would be amended to\nprovide express protection for certain fundamental rights,[39] and the right to religious\nliberty was unquestionably one of those rights. As noted, it was\nexpressly protected in 12 of the 13 State Constitutions, and these\nstate constitutional provisions provide the best evidence of the\nscope of the right embodied in the First Amendment.When we look at these provisions, we see one\npredominant model. This model extends broad protection for\nreligious liberty but expressly provides that the right does not\nprotect conduct that would endanger \u201cthe public peace\u201d or\n\u201csafety.\u201dThis model had deep roots in early colonial\ncharters. It appeared in the Rhode Island Charter of 1663,[40] the Second Charter of Carolina\nin 1665,[41] and the New\nYork Act Declaring Rights & Priviledges in 1691.[42]By the founding, more than half of the State\nConstitutions contained free-exercise provisions subject to a\n\u201cpeace and safety\u201d carveout or something similar. The Georgia\nConstitution is a good example. It provided that \u201c[a]ll persons\nwhatever shall have the free exercise of their religion; provided\nit be not repugnant to thepeace and safetyof the State.\u201d\nGa. Const., Art. LVI (1777), in Cogan 16 (emphasis added). The\nfounding era Constitutions of Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts,\nNew Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island, and South Carolina all\ncontained broad protections for religious exercise, subject to\nlimited peace-and-safety carveouts.[43]The predominance of this model is highlighted by\nits use in the laws governing the Northwest Territory. In the\nNorthwest Ordinance of 1787, the Continental Congress provided that\n\u201c[n]o person, demeaning himself ina peaceable and orderly\nmanner, shall ever be molested on account of his mode of\nworship, or religious sentiments, in the said territory.\u201d Art. I\n(emphasis added). After the ratification of the Constitution, the\nFirst Congress used similar language in the Northwest Ordinance of\n1789. See Act of Aug. 7, 1789, 1Stat. 52 (reaffirming Art. I of\nNorthwest Ordinance of 1787). Since the First Congress also framed\nand approved the Bill of Rights, we have often said that its\napparent understanding of the scope of those rights is entitled to\ngreat respect. See,e.g., Town of Greecev.Galloway,572 U.S.\n565, 575\u2013578 (2014);Harmelinv.Michigan,501 U.S.\n957, 980 (1991) (opinion of Scalia, J.);Marshv.Chambers,463 U.S.\n783, 786\u2013792 (1983);Carrollv.United States,267 U.S.\n132, 150\u2013151 (1925).3The model favored by Congress and the state\nlegislatures\u2014providing broad protection for the free exercise of\nreligion except where public \u201cpeace\u201d or \u201csafety\u201d would be\nendangered\u2014is antithetical toSmith.If, asSmithheld, the free-exercise right does not require any religious\nexemptions from generally applicable laws, it is not easy to\nimagine situations in which a public-peace-or-safety carveout would\nbe necessary. Legislatures enact generally applicable laws to\nprotect public peace and safety. If those laws are thought to be\nsufficient to address a particular type of conduct when engaged in\nfor a secular purpose, why wouldn\u2019t they also be sufficient to\naddress the same type of conduct when carried out for a religious\nreason?Smith\u2019s defenders have no good answer.\nTheir chief response is that the free-exercise provisions that\nincluded these carveouts were tantamount to theSmithrule\nbecause any conduct that is generally prohibited or generally\nrequired can be regarded as necessary to protect public peace or\nsafety. SeeCity of Boerne, 521 U.\u00a0S., at 539 (Scalia,\nJ., concurring in part) (\u201cAt the time these provisos were enacted,\nkeeping \u2018peace\u2019 and \u2018order\u2019 seems to have meant, precisely, obeying\nthe laws\u201d).This argument gives \u201cpublic peace and safety\u201d an\nunnaturally broad interpretation. Samuel Johnson\u2019s 1755 dictionary\ndefined \u201cpeace\u201d as: \u201c1. Respite from war.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. 2.\nQuiet from suits or disturbances.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. 3. Rest from\nany commotion. 4. Stil[l]ness from riots or\ntumults.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. 5. Reconciliation of\ndifferences.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. 6. A state not\nhostile.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. 7. Rest; quiet; content; freedom from\nterrour; heavenly rest.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d 2 Johnson.[44]In ordinary usage, the term \u201csafety\u201d was\nunderstood to mean: \u201c1. Freedom from danger. .\u00a0.\u00a0. 2.\nExemption from hurt. 3. Preservation from hurt. .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201dIbid.[45]When \u201cpeace\u201d and \u201csafety\u201d are understood in this\nway, it cannot be said that every violation of every law imperils\npublic \u201cpeace\u201d or \u201csafety.\u201d In 1791 (and today), violations of many\nlaws do not threaten \u201cwar,\u201d \u201cdisturbances,\u201d \u201ccommotion,\u201d \u201criots,\u201d\n\u201cterrour,\u201d \u201cdanger,\u201d or \u201churt.\u201d Blackstone catalogs numerous\nviolations that do not threaten any such harms, including\n\u201ccursing\u201d;[46] refusing to\npay assessments for \u201cthe repairs of sea banks and sea walls\u201d and\nthe \u201ccleansing of rivers, public streams, ditches and other\nconduits\u201d;[47] \u201cretaining a\nman\u2019s hired servant before his time is expired\u201d;[48] an attorney\u2019s failure to show up for a\ntrial;[49] the unauthorized\n\u201csolemniz[ing of a] marriage in any other place besides a church,\nor public chapel wherein banns have been usually\npublished\u201d;[50]\n\u201ctransporting and seducing our artists to settle abroad\u201d;[51] engaging in the conduct of \u201ca\ncommon scold\u201d;[52] and\n\u201cexercis[ing] a trade in any town, without having previously served\nas an apprentice for seven years.\u201d[53]In contrast to these violations, Blackstone\nlists \u201coffences against the public peace.\u201d 4 Commentaries on the\nLaws of England 142\u2013153 (1769). Those include: riotous assembling\nof 12 persons or more; unlawful hunting; anonymous threats and\ndemands; destruction of public floodgates, locks, or sluices on a\nnavigable river; public fighting; riots or unlawful assemblies;\n\u201ctumultuous\u201d petitioning; forcible entry or detainer; riding or\n\u201cgoing armed\u201d with dangerous or unusual weapons; spreading false\nnews to \u201cmake discord between the king and nobility, or concerning\nany great man of the realm\u201d; spreading \u201cfalse and pretended\u201d\nprophecies to disturb the peace; provoking breaches of the peace;\nand libel \u201cto provoke . . . wrath, or expose [an individual] to\npublic hatred, contempt, and ridicule.\u201dIbid.(emphasis\ndeleted); see also McConnell, Freedom from Persecution 835\u2013836.\nThese offenses might inform what constitutes actual or threatened\nbreaches of public peace or safety in the ordinary sense of those\nterms.[54] But the ordinary\nmeaning of offenses that threaten public peace or safety must be\nstretched beyond the breaking point to encompassallviolations ofanylaw.[55]CThat the free-exercise right included the\nright to certain religious exemptions is strongly supported by the\npractice of the Colonies and States. When there were important\nclashes between generally applicable laws and the religious\npractices of particular groups, colonial and state legislatures\nwere willing to grant exemptions\u2014even when the generally applicable\nlaws served critical state interests.Oath exemptions are illustrative. Oath\nrequirements were considered \u201cindispensable\u201d to civil society\nbecause they were thought to ensure that individuals gave truthful\ntestimony and fulfilled commitments. McConnell, Origins 1467.\nQuakers and members of some other religious groups refused to take\noaths,ibid., and therefore a categorical oath requirement\nwould have resulted in the complete exclusion of these Americans\nfrom important civic activities, such as testifying in court and\nvoting, seeibid.Tellingly, that is not what happened. In the\n1600s, Carolina allowed Quakers to enter a pledge rather than\nswearing an oath.Ibid.In 1691, New York permitted Quakers\nto give testimony after giving an affirmation.Ibid.Massachusetts did the same in 1743.Id.,at 1467\u20131468. In\n1734, New York also allowed Quakers to qualify to vote by making an\naffirmation, and in 1740, Georgia granted an exemption to Jews,\nallowing them to omit the phrase \u201c\u00a0\u2018on the faith of a\nChristian\u2019\u00a0\u201d from the State\u2019s naturalization oath.Id.,at 1467. By 1789, almost all States had passed oath exemptions.Id., at 1468.Some early State Constitutions and declarations\nof rights formally provided oath exemptions for religious\nobjectors. For instance, the Maryland Declaration of Rights of 1776\ndeclared that Quakers, Mennonites, and members of some other\nreligious groups \u201cought to be allowed to make their solemn\naffirmation\u201d instead of an oath. \u00a736, in Cogan 18. Similarly, the\nMassachusetts Constitution of 1780 permitted Quakers holding\ncertain government positions to decline to take the prescribed oath\nof office, allowing affirmations instead. Pt. II, ch. VI, Art. I,\ninid.,at 22. The Federal Constitution likewise permits\nfederal and state officials to make either an \u201cOathorAffirmation, to support this Constitution.\u201d Art.\u00a0VI, cl. 3\n(emphasis added); see also Art. I, \u00a73, cl. 6; Art. II, \u00a71, cl.\n8.Military conscription provides an even more\nrevealing example. In the Colonies and later in the States,\nable-bodied men of a certain age were required to serve in the\nmilitia, seeHeller, 554 U.\u00a0S., at 595\u2013596, but\nQuakers, Mennonites, and members of some other religious groups\nobjected to militia service on religious grounds, see McConnell,\nOrigins 1468. The militia was regarded as essential to the security\nof the State and the preservation of freedom, seeHeller,\n554 U.\u00a0S., at 597\u2013598, but colonial governments nevertheless\ngranted religious exemptions, see McConnell, Origins 1468. Rhode\nIsland, Maryland, North Carolina, and New Hampshire did so in the\nfounding era.Ibid.In 1755, New York permitted a\nconscientious objector to obtain an exemption if he paid a fee or\nsent a substitute.Ibid.Massachusetts adopted a similar law\ntwo years later, and Virginia followed suit in 1776.Ibid.,\nand n. 297.The Continental Congress also granted exemptions\nto religious objectors because conscription would do \u201cviolence to\ntheir consciences.\u201d Resolution of July 18, 1775, in 2 Journals of\nthe Continental Congress, 1774\u20131789, p. 189 (W. Ford ed. 1905)\n(quoted in McConnell, Origins 1469, and n. 299). This decision is\nespecially revealing because during that time the Continental Army\nwas periodically in desperate need of soldiers,[56] the very survival of the new Nationoften seemed in danger,[57] and the Members of Congress faced bleak\npersonal prospects if the war was lost.[58] Yet despite these stakes, exemptions were\ngranted.Colonies with established churches also\npermitted non-members to decline to pay special taxes dedicated to\nthe support of ministers of the established church. McConnell,\nOrigins 1469. Massachusetts and Connecticut exempted Baptists and\nQuakers in 1727.Ibid.Virginia provided exemptions to\nHuguenots in 1700, German Lutherans in 1730, and dissenters from\nthe Church of England in 1776.Ibid.; see also S. Cobb, The\nRise of Religious Liberty in America 98, 492 (1902). Beginning in\n1692, New Hampshire exempted those who could prove they were\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018conscientiously\u2019\u00a0\u201d of a \u201c\u00a0\u2018different\npersuasion,\u2019\u00a0\u201d regularly attended their own religious\nservices, and contributed financially to their faith.\nMcConnell,Origins 1469.Various other religious exemptions were also\nprovided. North Carolina and Maryland granted exemptions from the\nrequirement that individuals remove their hats in court, a gesture\nthat Quakers viewed as an impermissible showing of respect to a\nsecular authority.Id., at 1471\u20131472. And Rhode Island\nexempted Jews from some marriage laws.Id., at 1471.In an effort to dismiss the significance of\nthese legislative exemptions, it has been argued that they show\nonly what the Constitution permits, not what it requires.City\nof Boerne, 521 U.\u00a0S., at 541 (opinion of Scalia, J.). But\nlegislatures provided those accommodations before the concept of\njudicial review took hold, and their actions are therefore strong\nevidence of the founding era\u2019s understanding of the free-exercise\nright. See McConnell,Free Exercise Revisionism 1119. Cf.Heller, 554 U.\u00a0S., at 600\u2013603 (looking to state\nconstitutions that preceded the adoption of the Second\nAmendment).DDefenders ofSmithhave advanced\nhistorical arguments of their own, but they are unconvincing, and\nin any event, plainly insufficient to overcome the ordinary meaning\nof the constitutional text.1One prominent argument points to language in\nsome founding-era charters and constitutions prohibiting laws or\ngovernment actions that were taken \u201cfor\u201d or \u201con account\u201d of\nreligion. SeeCity of Boerne, 521 U.\u00a0S., at 538\u2013539\n(opinion of Scalia, J.). That phrasing, it is argued, reaches only\nmeasures that target religion, not neutral and generally applicable\nlaws. This argument has many flaws.No such language appears in the Free Exercise\nClause, and in any event, the argument rests on a crabbed reading\nof the words \u201cfor\u201d or \u201con account of\u00a0\u201d religion. As Professor\nMcConnell has explained, \u201c[i]f a member of the Native American\nChurch is arrested for ingesting peyote during a religious\nceremony, then he surely is molested \u2018for\u2019 or \u2018on account of\u00a0\u2019\nhis religious practice\u2014even though the law under which he is\narrested is neutral and generally applicable.\u201d Freedom From\nPersecution 834.This argument also ignores the full text of many\nof the provisions on which it relies.Id.,at 833\u2013834. While\nsome protect against government actions taken \u201cfor\u201d or \u201con account\nof\u00a0\u201d religion, they do not stop there. Instead, they go on to\nprovide broader protection for religious liberty. See,e.g.,Maryland Act Concerning Religion (1649), in Cogan 17 (guaranteeing\nresidents not be \u201ctroubled .\u00a0.\u00a0. in the free exercise [of\nreligion]\u201d); New York Constitution (1777), inid., at 26\n(guaranteeing \u201cthe free Exercise and Enjoyment of religious\nProfession and Worship\u201d).2Another argument advanced bySmith\u2019s\ndefenders relies on the paucity of early cases \u201crefusing to enforce\na generally applicable statute because of its failure to make\naccommodation,\u201dCity of Boerne, 521 U.\u00a0S., at 542\n(opinion of Scalia, J.). If exemptions were thought to be\nconstitutionally required, they contend, we would see many such\ncases.There might be something to this argument if\nthere were a great many cases denying exemptions and few granting\nthem, but the fact is that diligent research has found only a\nhandful of cases going either way. Commentators have discussed the\ndearth of cases, and as they note, there are many possible\nexplanations.[59] Early 19th\ncentury legislation imposed only limited restrictions on private\nconduct, and this minimized the chances of conflict between\ngenerally applicable laws and religious practices. The principal\nconflicts that arose\u2014involving oaths, conscription, and taxes to\nsupport an established church\u2014were largely resolved by state\nconstitutional provisions and laws granting exemptions. And the\nreligious demographics of the time decreased the likelihood of\nconflicts. The population was overwhelmingly Christian and\nProtestant, the major Protestant denominations made up the great\nbulk of the religious adherents,[60] and other than with respect to the issue of taxes to\nsupport an established church, it is hard to think of conflicts\nbetween the practices of the members of these denominations and\ngenerally applicable laws that a state legislature might have\nenacted.Members of minority religions are most likely to\nencounter such conflicts, and the largest minority group, the\nQuakers, who totaled about 10% of religious adherents,[61] had received exemptions for the\npractices that conflicted with generally applicable laws. As will\nlater be shown, seeinfra, at 46\u201350, the small number of\nreligious-exemption cases that occurred during the early 19th\ncentury involved members of what were then tiny religious\ngroups\u2014such as Catholics, Jews, and Covenanters.[62] Given the size of these groups, one\nwould not expect a large number of cases. And where cases arose,\nthe courts\u2019 decisions may not have always been reported. Barclay,\nThe Historical Origins of Judicial Religious Exemptions, 96 Notre\nDame L. Rev. 55, 70 (2020).3When the body of potentially relevant cases is\nexamined, they provide little support forSmith\u2019s\ninterpretation of the free-exercise right. Not only are these\ndecisions few in number, but they reached mixed results. In\naddition, some are unreasoned; some provide ambiguous explanations;\nand many of the cases denying exemptions were based on grounds that\ndo not supportSmith.The most influential early case granting an\nexemption wasPeoplev.Philips, 1 W. L.\u00a0J. 109,\n112\u2013113 (Gen. Sess., N.\u00a0Y. 1813), where the court held that a\nCatholic priest could not be compelled to testify about a\nconfession. The priest\u2019s refusal, the court reasoned, was protected\nby the state constitutional right to the free exercise of religion\nand did not fall within the exception for \u201cacts of licentiousness\u201d\nand \u201cpractices inconsistent with the peace or safety of th[e]\nState.\u201d[63] This, of course,\nis exactly the understanding of the free-exercise right that is\nseen in the founding era State Constitutions.AlthoughPhilipswas not officially\nreported, knowledge of the decision appears to have spread widely.\nFour years later, another New York court implicitly reaffirmed the\nprinciplePhilipsrecognized but found the decision\ninapplicable because the Protestant minister who was called to\ntestify did not feel a religious obligation to refuse. SeeSmith\u2019s Case, 2 N.\u00a0Y. City-Hall Recorder 77, 80,\nand n. (1817); McConnell, Origins 1505\u20131506; Walsh 40\u201341.In 1827, a South Carolina court relied onPhilipsas support for its decision to grant an exemption\nfrom a state law relied on to bar the testimony of a witness who\ndenied a belief in punishment after death for testifying falsely,\nand the State\u2019s newly constituted high court approved that opinion.Farnandisv.Henderson, 1 Carolina L. J. 202, 213,\n214 (1827).[64]InCommonwealthv.Cronin, 2 Va.\nCir. 488, 498, 500, 505 (1855), a Virginia court followedPhilipsand held that a priest\u2019s free-exercise right\nrequired an exemption from the general common law rule compelling a\nwitness to \u201cdisclose all he may know\u201d when giving testimony.On the other side of the ledger, the most\nprominent opponent of exemptions was John Bannister Gibson of the\nPennsylvania Supreme Court. Today, Gibson is best known for his\ndissent inEakinv. Raub, 12 Serg. & Rawle 330,\n355\u2013356 (1825),\u00a0which challenged John Marshall\u2019s argument for\njudicial review inMarburyv. Madison, 1 Cranch 137\n(1803). See McConnell, Origins 1507. Three years afterEakin, Gibson\u2019s dissent inCommonwealthv.Lesher, 17 Serg. & Rawle 155 (Pa. 1828), advanced a\nrelated argument against decisions granting religious exemptions.\nGibson agreed that the state constitutional provision protecting\nreligious liberty conferred the right to do or forbear from doing\nany act \u201cnot prejudicial to the public weal,\u201d but he argued that\njudges had no authority to override legislative judgments about\nwhat the public weal required.Id.,at 160\u2013161 (emphasis\ndeleted).Three years later, he made a similar argument in\ndicta inPhilips\u2019s Executorsv.Gratz, 2 Pen. &\nW. 412, 412\u2013413 (Pa. 1831), where a Jewish plaintiff had taken a\nnon-suit (agreed to a dismissal) in a civil case scheduled for\ntrial on a Saturday. Gibson\u2019s opinion for the Court set aside the\nnon-suit on other grounds but rejected the plaintiff\u00a0\u2019s\nreligious objection to trial on Saturday.Id.,at 416\u2013417.\nHe proclaimed that a citizen\u2019s obligation to the State must always\ntake precedence over any religious obligation, and he expressly\nregistered disagreement with the New York court\u2019s decision inPhilips.Id.,at 417.In South Carolina, an exemption claim was denied\ninStatev.Willson, 13 S. C. L. 393, 394\u2013397 (1823),\nwhere the court refused to exempt a member of the Covenanters\nreligious movement from jury service. Because Covenanters opposed\nthe Constitution on religious grounds, they refused to engage in\nactivities, such as jury service and voting, that required an oath\nto support the Constitution or otherwise enlisted their\nparticipation in the Nation\u2019s scheme of government.[65] It is possible to read the opinion inWillsonas embodying something like theSmithrule\u2014or\nas concluding that granting the exemption would have opened the\nfloodgates and undermined public peace and safety. See 13 S. C. L.,\nat 395 (\u201cwho could distinguish .\u00a0.\u00a0. between the pious\nasseveration of a holy man and that of an accomplished villain\u201d).\nBut ifWillsonis read as rejecting religious exemptions,\nSouth Carolina\u2019s reconstituted high court reversed that position inFarnandis.[66]Other cases denying exemptions are even less\nhelpful toSmith\u2019s defenders. Three decisions rejected\nchallenges to Sunday closing laws by merchants who celebrated\nSaturday as the Sabbath, but at least two of these were based on\nthe court\u2019s conclusion that the asserted religious belief was\nunfounded. SeeCity Council of Charlestonv.Benjamin, 33 S. C. L. 508, 529 (1846) (\u201cThere is\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. no violation of the Hebrew\u2019s religion, in requiring\nhim to cease from labor on another day than his Sabbath, if he be\nleft free to observe the latter according to his religion\u201d\n(emphasis deleted));Commonwealthv.Wolf, 3 Serg.\n& Rawle 47, 50, 51 (Pa. 1817) (\u201c[T]he Jewish Talmud\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. asserts no such doctrine\u201d and the objection was\nmade \u201cout of mere caprice\u201d). That reasoning is contrary to a\nprinciple thatSmithreaffirmed: \u201cRepeatedly and in many\ndifferent contexts, we have warned that courts must not presume to\ndetermine .\u00a0.\u00a0. the plausibility of a religious claim.\u201d\n494 U.\u00a0S., at 887.A third Sunday closing law decision appears to\nrest at least in part on a similar ground. SeeSpechtv.Commonwealth, 8 Pa. 312 (1848). The court observed that the\nmerchant\u2019s conscience rights might have been violated if his\nreligion actually required him to work on Sunday, but the court\nconcluded that the commandment to keep holy the Sabbath had never\nbeen understood to impose \u201can imperative obligation to fill up each\nday of the other six with some worldly employment.\u201dId., at\n326.Other cases cited as denying exemptions were\ndecided on nebulous grounds. InStansburyv. Marks, 2\nDall. 213 (Pa. 1793), a decision of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court,\nthe case report in its entirety states: \u201cIn this cause (which was\ntried on Saturday, the 5th of April) the defendant offered Jonas\nPhillips, a Jew, as a witness; but he refused to be sworn, because\nit was his Sabbath. The Court, therefore, fined him \u00a310; but the\ndefendant, afterwards, waving the benefit of his testimony, he was\ndischarged from the fine.\u201d (Emphasis deleted.) What can be deduced\nfrom this cryptic summary? Was the issue mooted when the defendant\nwaived the benefit of Phillips\u2019s testimony? Who can tell?InCommonwealthv.Drake, 15 Mass.\n161 (1818), the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts summarily\naffirmed the conviction of a criminal defendant who was convicted\nafter the trial court admitted the testimony of his fellow church\nmembers before whom he had confessed. The State argued that the\ndefendant had voluntarily confessed, that his confession was not\nrequired by any \u201cecclesiastical rule,\u201d and that he had confessed\n\u201cnot to the church\u201d but \u201cto his friends and neighbours.\u201dId., at 162. Because the court provided no explanation of\nits decision, this case sheds no light on the understanding of the\nfree-exercise right.All told, this mixed bag of antebellum decisions\ndoes little to supportSmith, and extending the search past\nthe Civil War does not advanceSmith\u2019s cause. One of the\nobjectives of the Fourteenth Amendment, it has been argued, was to\nprotect the religious liberty of African-Americans in the South,\nwhere a combination of laws that did not facially target religious\npractice had been used to suppress religious exercise by slaves.\nSee generally Lash, The Second Adoption of the Free Exercise\nClause: Religious Exemptions Under the Fourteenth Amendment, 88 Nw.\nU. L. Rev. 1106 (1994).4Some have claimed that the drafting history of\nthe Bill of Rights supportsSmith. See Brief for First\nAmendment Scholars asAmici Curiae10\u201311; Mu\u00f1oz, Original\nMeaning 1085. But as Professor Philip Hamburger, one ofSmith\u2019s most prominent academic defenders, has concluded,\n\u201c[w]hat any of this [history] implies about the meaning of the Free\nExercise Clause is speculative.\u201d Religious Exemption 928.Here is the relevant history. The House debated\na provision, originally proposed by Madison, that protected the\nright to bear arms but included language stating that \u201cno person,\nreligiously scrupulous, shall be compelled to bear arms.\u201d 1 Annals\nof Cong. 749, 766 (1789); see also Mu\u00f1oz, Original Meaning 1112.\nSome Members spoke in favor ofthe proposal,[67] others opposed it,[68] and in the end, after adding the words \u201cin person\u201d at\nthe end of the clause, the House adopted it.[69] The Senate, however, rejected the proposal\n(for reasons not provided on the public record),id., at\n1116, and the House acceded to the deletion.Those who claim that this episode supportsSmithargue that the House would not have found it necessary\nto include this proviso in the Second Amendment if it had thought\nthat the Free Exercise Clause already protected conscientious\nobjectors from conscription, Mu\u00f1oz, Original Meaning 1120, but that\nconclusion is unfounded. Those who favored Madison\u2019s language might\nhave thought it necessary, not because the free-exercise rightneverrequired religious exemptions but because they feared\nthat exemption from military service would be held to fall into the\nfree-exercise right\u2019s carveout for conduct that threatens public\nsafety.[70] And of course,\nit could be argued that the willingness of the House to\nconstitutionalize this exemption despite its potential effect on\nnational security shows the depth of the Members\u2019 commitment to the\nconcept of religious exemptions.As for the Senate\u2019s rejection of the proviso, we\nhave often warned against drawing inferences from Congress\u2019s\nfailure to adopt a legislative proposal. SeeSchneidewindv.ANR Pipeline Co.,485 U.S.\n293, 306 (1988) (\u201cThis Court generally is reluctant to draw\ninferences from Congress\u2019 failure to act\u201d);Brechtv.Abrahamson,507 U.S.\n619, 632\u2013633 (1993) (collecting cases). And in this instance,\nthere are many possible explanations for what happened in the\nSenate. The rejection of the provisocouldhave been due to\na general objection to religious exemptions, but it could also have\nbeen based on any of the following grounds: opposition to this\nparticular exemption, the belief that conscientious objectors were\nalready protected by the Free Exercise Clause, a belief that\nmilitary service fell within the public safety carveout, or the\nview that Congress should be able to decide whether to grant or\nwithhold such exemptions based on its assessment of what national\nsecurity required at particular times.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*In sum, based on the text of the Free Exercise\nClause and evidence about the original understanding of the\nfree-exercise right, the case forSmithfails to overcome\nthe more natural reading of the text. Indeed, the case againstSmithis very convincing.VThat conclusion cannot end our analysis. \u201cWe\nwill not overturn a past decision unless there are strong grounds\nfor doing so,\u201dJanusv.State, County, and Municipal\nEmployees,585 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2018) (slip op., at 34),\nbut at the same time,stare decisisis \u201cnot an inexorable\ncommand.\u201dIbid.(internal quotation marks omitted). It \u201cis\nat its weakest when we interpret the Constitution because our\ninterpretation can be altered only by constitutional amendment or\nby overruling our prior decisions.\u201dAgostiniv.Felton,521 U.S.\n203, 235 (1997). And it applies with \u201cperhaps least force of\nall to decisions that wrongly denied First Amendment rights.\u201dJanus, 585 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 34); see alsoFederal Election Comm\u2019nv.Wisconsin Right to Life,\nInc.,551 U.S.\n449, 500 (2007) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring\nin judgment) (\u201cThis Court has not hesitated to overrule decisions\noffensive to the First Amendment (a fixed star in our\nconstitutional constellation, if there is one)\u201d (internal quotation\nmarks omitted));Citizens Unitedv.Federal Election\nComm\u2019n,558 U.S.\n310, 365 (2010) (overrulingAustinv.Michigan\nChamber of Commerce,494 U.S.\n652(1990));West Virginia Bd. of Ed.v.Barnette,319 U.S.\n624, 642 (1943) (overrulingMinersville School Dist.v. Gobitis,310 U.S.\n586(1940)).In assessing whether to overrule a past decision\nthat appears to be incorrect, we have considered a variety of\nfactors, and four of those weigh strongly againstSmith: its\nreasoning; its consistency with other decisions; the workability of\nthe rule that it established; and developments since the decision\nwas handed down. SeeJanus, 585 U.\u00a0S., at ___\u2013___ (slip\nop., at 34\u201335). No relevant factor, including reliance, weighs inSmith\u2019s favor.ASmith\u2019s reasoning. As explained in\ndetail above,Smithis a methodological outlier. It ignored\nthe \u201cnormal and ordinary\u201d meaning of the constitutional text, seeHeller, 554 U.\u00a0S., at 576, and it made no real effort\nto explore the understanding of the free-exercise right at the time\nof the First Amendment\u2019s adoption. And the Court adopted its\nreading of the Free Exercise Clause with no briefing on the issue\nfrom the parties oramici. Laycock, 8 J. L. & Religion,\nat 101.Then there isSmith\u2019s treatment of\nprecedent. It looked for precedential support in strange places,\nand the many precedents that stood in its way received remarkably\nrough treatment.Looking for a case that had endorsed its\nno-exemptions view,Smithturned toGobitis, 310\nU.\u00a0S., at 586, a decision that Justice Scalia himself later\nacknowledged was \u201cerroneous,\u201dWisconsin Right to Life,Inc., 551 U.\u00a0S., at 500\u2013501 (opinion concurring in\npart). William Gobitas,[71]\na 10-year-old fifth grader, and his 12-year-old sister Lillian\nrefused to salute the flag during the Pledge of Allegiance because,\nalong with other Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, they thought the salute\nconstituted idolatry. 310 U.\u00a0S., at 591\u2013592.[72] William\u2019s \u201cteacher tried to force his\narm up, but William held on to his pocket and successfully\nresisted.\u201d[73] The Gobitas\nchildren were expelled from school, and the family grocery was\nboycotted.[74]This Court upheld the children\u2019s expulsion\nbecause, in ringing rhetoric quoted bySmith,\n\u201c[c]onscientious scruples have not, in the course of the long\nstruggle for religious toleration, relieved the individual from\nobedience to a general law not aimed at the promotion or\nrestriction of religious beliefs.\u201d 310 U.\u00a0S., at 594; see alsoSmith, 494 U.\u00a0S., at 879 (quoting this passage). This\ndeclaration was overblown when issued in 1940. (As noted, many\nreligious exemptions had been granted by legislative bodies, and\nthe 1940 statute instituting the peacetime draft continued that\ntradition by exempting conscientious objectors. Selective Training\nand Service Act, 54Stat. 885, 889.) By 1990, whenSmithwas\nhanded down, the pronouncement flew in the face of nearly 40 years\nof Supreme Court precedent.But even if all that is put aside,Smith\u2019s recourse toGobitiswas surprising because\nthe decision was overruled just three years later when three of the\nJustices in the majority had second thoughts. SeeBarnette,\n319 U.S. 642;id.,at 643\u2013644 (Black and Douglas, JJ.,\nconcurring);id.,at 644\u2013646 (Murphy, J., concurring).\nTurningGobitis\u2019s words on their head,Barnetteheld\nthat students with religious objections to saluting the flag were\nindeed \u201crelieved .\u00a0.\u00a0. from obedience to a general [rule]\nnot aimed at the promotion or restriction of religious beliefs.\u201dGobitis, 310 U.\u00a0S., at 594.After revivingGobitis\u2019s anti-exemption\nrhetoric,Smithturned toReynoldsv.United\nStates,98 U.S.\n145, an 1879 decision upholding the polygamy conviction of a\nmember of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. UnlikeGobitis,Reynoldsat least had not been\noverruled,[75] but the\ndecision was not based on anything likeSmith\u2019s\ninterpretation of the Free Exercise Clause. It rested primarily on\nthe proposition that the Free Exercise Clause protects beliefs, not\nconduct. 98 U.\u00a0S., at 166\u2013167. The Court had repudiated that\ndistinction a half century beforeSmithwas decided. SeeCantwell, 310 U.\u00a0S., at 303\u2013304;Murdockv.Pennsylvania,319 U.S.\n105, 110\u2013111, 117 (1943). AndSmithitself agreed! See\n494 U.\u00a0S., at 877.The remaining pre-Sherbertcases cited bySmithactually cut against its interpretation. None was\nbased on the rule thatSmithadopted. Although these\ndecisions ended up denying exemptions, they did so on other\ngrounds. InPrincev.Massachusetts,321 U.S.\n158(1944), where a Jehovah\u2019s Witness who enlisted a child to\ndistribute religious literature was convicted for violating a state\nchild labor law, the decision was based on the Court\u2019s assessment\nof the strength of the State\u2019s interest.Id., at 159\u2013160,\n162, 169\u2013170; see alsoYoder, 406 U.\u00a0S., at 230\u2013231\n(describing thePrinceCourt\u2019s rationale).InBraunfeldv.Brown,366 U.S.\n599, 601, 609 (1961) (plurality opinion), which rejected a\nJewish merchant\u2019s challenge to Pennsylvania\u2019s Sunday closing laws,\nthe Court balanced the competing interests. The Court attached\ndiminished weight to the burden imposed by the law (because it did\nnot require work on Saturday),id.,at 606,[76] and on the other side of the balance,\nthe Court accepted the Commonwealth\u2019s view that the public welfare\nwas served by providing a uniform day of rest,id., at\n608\u2013609; seeSherbert, 374 U.\u00a0S., at 408\u2013409\n(discussingBraunfeld).WhenSmithcame to post-Sherbertcases, the picture did not improve. First, in order to placeSherbert,Hobbie, andThomasin a special\ncategory reserved for cases involving unemployment compensation, an\ninventive transformation was required. None of those opinions\ncontained a hint that they were limited in that way. And sinceSmithitself involved the award of unemployment compensation\nbenefits under a scheme that allowed individualized exemptions, it\nis hard to see why that case did not fall into the same\ncategory.The Court tried to escape this problem by\nframing Alfred Smith\u2019s and Galen Black\u2019s free-exercise claims as\nrequests for exemptions from the Oregon law criminalizing the\npossession of peyote, see 494 U.\u00a0S., at 876, but neither Smith\nnor Black was prosecuted for that offense even though the State was\nwell aware of what they had done. The State had the discretion to\ndecline prosecution based on the facts of particular cases, and\nthat is presumably what it did regarding Smith and Black. Why this\nwas not sufficient to bring the case withinSmith\u2019s rule\nabout individualized exemptions is unclear. See McConnell, Free\nExercise Revisionism 1124.Having pigeon-holedSherbert,Hobbie, andThomasas unemployment compensation\ndecisions,Smithstill faced problems. For one thing, the\nCourt had previously applied theSherberttest in many cases\nnot involving unemployment compensation, includingHernandezv.Commissioner,490 U.S.\n680(1989) (disallowance of tax deduction);Lee,455 U.S.\n252(payment of taxes); andGillette,401 U.S.\n437(denial of conscientious objector status to person with\nreligious objection to a particular war). To get these cases out of\nthe way,Smithclaimed that, because they ultimately found\nno free-exercise violations, they merely \u201cpurportedto apply\ntheSherberttest.\u201d 494 U.\u00a0S., at 883 (emphasis\nadded).This was a curious observation. In all those\ncases, the Court invoked theSherberttest but found that it\ndid not require relief. SeeHernandez, 490 U.\u00a0S., at\n699;Lee, 455 U. S., at 257\u2013260;Gillette, 401\nU.\u00a0S., at 462.Was theSmithCourt questioning\nthe sincerity of these earlier opinions? If not, then in what sense\ndid those decisions merely \u201cpurport\u201d to applySherbert?Finally, having swept all these cases from the\nboard,Smithstill faced at least one big troublesome\nprecedent:Yoder.Yodernot only applied theSherberttest but held that the Free Exercise Clause\nrequired an exemption totally unrelated to unemployment benefits.\n406 U.\u00a0S., at 220\u2013221, 236. To dispose ofYoder,Smithwas forced to invent yet another special category of\ncases, those involving \u201chybrid-rights\u201d claims.Yoderfell\ninto this category because it implicated both the Amish parents\u2019\nfree-exercise claim and a parental-rights claim stemming fromPiercev. Society of Sisters,268\nU.S. 510(1925). SeeSmith, 494 U.\u00a0S., at 881. And\nin such hybrid cases,Smithheld, theSherberttest\nsurvived. See 494 U.\u00a0S., at 881\u2013882.It is hard to see the justification for this\ncurious doctrine. The idea seems to be that if two independently\ninsufficient constitutional claims join forces they may merge into\na single valid hybrid claim, but surely the rule cannot be that\nasserting two invalid claims, no matter how weak, is always enough.\nSo perhaps the doctrine requires the assignment of a numerical\nscore to each claim. If a passing grade is 70 and a party advances\na free-speech claim that earns a grade of 40 and a free-exercise\nclaim that merits a grade of 31, the result would be a (barely)\nsufficient hybrid claim. Such a scheme is obviously unworkable and\nhas never been recognized outside ofSmith.And then there is the problem that the\nhybrid-rights exception would largely swallow upSmith\u2019s\ngeneral rule. A great many claims for religious exemptions can\neasily be understood as hybrid free-exercise/free-speech claims.\nTake the claim inSmithitself. To members of the Native\nAmerican Church, the ingestion of peyote during a religious\nceremony is a sacrament. When Smith and Black participated in this\nsacrament, weren\u2019t they engaging in a form of expressive conduct?\nTheir ingestion of peyote \u201ccommunicate[d], in a rather dramatic\nway, [their] faith in the tenets of the Native American Church,\u201d\nand the State\u2019s prohibition of that practice \u201cinterfered with their\nability to communicate this message\u201d in violation of the Free\nSpeech Clause. McConnell, Free Exercise Revisionism 1122. And, \u201cif\na hybrid claim is one in which a litigant would actually obtain an\nexemption from a formally neutral, generally applicable law underanotherconstitutional provision, then there would have been\nno reason for the Court in [the so-called] hybrid cases to have\nmentioned the Free Exercise Clause at all.\u201dLukumi, 508\nU.\u00a0S., at 566\u2013567 (opinion of Souter, J.); see also Laycock, 8\nJ. L. & Religion, at 106 (noting thatSmith\u201creduces the\nfree exercise clause to a cautious redundancy, relevant only to\n\u2018hybrid\u2019 cases\u201d). It is telling that this Court has never once\naccepted a \u201chybrid rights\u201d claim in the more than three decades\nsinceSmith.In addition to all these maneuvers\u2014creating\nspecial categories for unemployment compensation cases, cases\ninvolving individualized exemptions, and hybrid-rights\ncases\u2014Smithignored the multiple occasions when the Court\nhad directly repudiated the very rule thatSmithadopted.\nSeesupra,at 13\u201314.Smith\u2019s rough treatment of prior\ndecisions diminishes its own status as a precedent.BConsistency with other precedents.Smithis also discordant with other precedents.Smithdid not overruleSherbertor any of the other cases that\nbuilt onSherbertfrom 1963 to 1990, and for the reasons\njust discussed,Smithis tough to harmonize with those\nprecedents.The same is true about more recent decisions. InHosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church and Schoolv.\nEEOC,565 U.S.\n171(2012), the Court essentially held that the First Amendment\nentitled a religious school to a special exemption from the\nrequirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA),\n104Stat. 327, 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a712101et seq. When the\nschool discharged a teacher, she claimed that she had been\nterminated because of disability. 565 U.\u00a0S., at 178\u2013179. Since\nthe school considered her a \u201cminister\u201d and she provided religious\ninstruction for her students, the school argued that her discharge\nfell within the so-called \u201cministerial exception\u201d to generally\napplicable employment laws.Id.,at 180. The Equal\nEmployment Opportunity Commission maintained thatSmithprecluded recognition of this exception because \u201cthe ADA\u2019s\nprohibition on retaliation, like Oregon\u2019s prohibition on peyote\nuse, is a valid and neutral law of general applicability.\u201dId., at 190; seeid., at 189\u2013190. We nevertheless\nheld that the exception applied.Id.,at 190.[77] Similarly, inOur Lady of Guadalupe\nSchoolv.Morrissey-Berru, 591 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___\u2013___\n(2020) (slip op., at 21\u201322), we found that other religious schools\nwere entitled to similar exemptions from both the ADA and the Age\nDiscrimination in Employment Act of 1967.There is also tension betweenSmithand\nour opinion inMasterpiece Cakeshop, Ltd.v. Colorado\nCivil Rights Comm\u2019n,584 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2018). In that case,\nwe observed that \u201c[w]hen it comes to weddings, it can be assumed\nthat a member of the clergy who objects to gay marriage on moral\nand religious grounds could not be compelled to perform the\nceremony without denial of his or her right to the free exercise of\nreligion.\u201dId., at ___ (slip op., at 10). The clear import\nof this observation is that such a member of the clergy would be\nentitled to a religious exemption from a state law restricting the\nauthority to perform a state-recognized marriage to individuals who\nare willing to officiate both opposite-sex and same-sex\nweddings.Other inconsistencies exist.Smithdeclared that \u201ca private right to ignore generally applicable laws\u201d\nwould be a \u201cconstitutional anomaly,\u201d 494 U.\u00a0S., at 886, but\nthis Court has often permitted exemptions from generally applicable\nlaws in First Amendment cases. For instance, inBoy Scouts of\nAmericav.Dale,530 U.S.\n640, 656 (2000), we granted the Boy Scouts an exemption from an\notherwise generally applicable state public accommodations law. InHurleyv. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group\nof Boston,Inc.,515 U.S.\n557, 573 (1995), parade sponsors\u2019 speech was exempted from the\nrequirements of a similar law.The granting of an exemption from a generally\napplicable law is tantamount to a holding that a law is\nunconstitutional as applied to a particular set of facts, see\nBarclay & Rienzi, Constitutional Anomalies or As-Applied\nChallenges? A Defense of Religious\u00a0Exemptions, 59 Boston\nCollege L. Rev. 1595, 1611 (2018), and cases holding\ngenerally applicable laws unconstitutional as applied are\nunremarkable. \u201c[T]he normal rule is that partial, rather than\nfacial, invalidation is the required course, such that a statute\nmay .\u00a0.\u00a0. be declared invalid to the extent that it\nreaches too far, but otherwise left intact.\u201d Ayotte v. Planned\nParenthood of Northern New Eng.,546 U.S.\n320, 329 (2006) (internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis\nadded). Thus, inBrownv.Socialist Workers \u201974 Campaign\nComm. (Ohio),459 U.S.\n87(1982), we held that a law requiring disclosure of campaign\ncontributions and expenditures could not be \u201cconstitutionally\napplied\u201d to a minor party whose members and contributors would face\n\u201cthreats, harassment or reprisals.\u201dId., at 101\u2013102. Cf.NAACPv. Alabama ex\u00a0rel. Patterson,357 U.S.\n449, 466 (1958) (exempting the NAACP from a disclosure order\nentered to purportedly investigate compliance with a generally\napplicable statute). InHustler Magazine, Inc.v.Falwell,485 U.S.\n46, 56 (1988), andSnyderv. Phelps,562 U.S.\n443, 459 (2011), the Court held that an established and\ngenerally applicable tort claim (the intentional infliction of\nemotional distress) could not constitutionally be applied to the\nparticular expression at issue. Similarly, breach-of-the-peace\nlaws, although generally valid, have been held to violate the Free\nSpeech Clause under certain circumstances. SeeCohenv.\nCalifornia,403 U.S.\n15, 16, 26 (1971);Cantwell, 310 U.\u00a0S., at 300,\n311; see alsoBartnickiv.Vopper,532 U.S.\n514, 517, 535 (2001) (respondents not liable under law\nprohibiting disclosure of illegally intercepted communications\nbecause their speech was protected by the First Amendment);United Statesv.Treasury Employees,513 U.S.\n454, 477 (1995) (respondents not subject to the honoraria ban\nbecause it would violate their First Amendment rights);United\nStatesv.Grace,461 U.S.\n171, 175, 179, 183 (1983) (respondents engaging in expressive\nconduct on public sidewalks not subject to law generally regulating\nconduct on Supreme Court grounds).Finally,Smith\u2019s treatment of the\nfree-exercise right is fundamentally at odds with how we usually\nthink about liberties guaranteed by the Bill of Rights. As Justice\nJackson famously put it, \u201c[t]he very purpose of a Bill of Rights\nwas to withdraw certain subjects from the vicissitudes of political\ncontroversy, to place them beyond the reach of majorities and\nofficials.\u201dBarnette, 319 U.\u00a0S., at 638.Smith,\nby contrast, held that protection of religious liberty was better\nleft to the political process than to courts. 494 U.\u00a0S., at\n890. InSmith\u2019s view, the Nation simply could not \u201cafford\nthe luxury\u201d of protecting the free exercise of religion from\ngenerally applicable laws.Id., at 888. Under this\ninterpretation, the free exercise of religion does not receive the\njudicial protection afforded to other, favored rights.CWorkability. One ofSmith\u2019s\nsupposed virtues was ease of application, but things have not\nturned out that way. Instead, at least four serious problems have\narisen and continue to plague courts when called upon to applySmith.1\u201cHybrid-rights\u201d cases. The \u201chybrid\nrights\u201d exception, which was essential to distinguishYoder,\nhas baffled the lower courts. They are divided into at least three\ncamps. SeeCombsv.Homer-Center School Dist., 540\nF.3d 231, 244\u2013247 (CA3 2008) (describing Circuit split). Some\ncourts have taken the extraordinary step of openly refusing to\nfollow this part ofSmith\u2019s interpretation. The Sixth\nCircuit was remarkably blunt: \u201c[H]old[ing] that the legal standard\nunder the Free Exercise Clause depends on whether a free-exercise\nclaim is coupled with other constitutional rights .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nis completely illogical.\u201dKissingerv. Board of Trustees\nof Ohio State Univ., 5 F.3d 177, 180 (1993). The Second and\nThird Circuits have taken a similar approach. SeeLeebaertv.Harrington,332 F.3d 134, 144 (CA2 2003) (\u201cWe .\u00a0.\u00a0. can think of\nno good reason for the standard of review to vary simply with the\nnumber of constitutional rights that the plaintiff asserts have\nbeen violated\u201d);Knightv. Connecticut Dept.of\nPub. Health,275 F.3d 156, 167 (CA2 2001);Combs, 540 F.\u00a03d, at\n247 (\u201cUntil the Supreme Court provides direction, we believe the\nhybrid-rights theory to be dicta\u201d).A second camp holds that the hybrid-rights\nexception applies only when a free-exercise claim is joined with\nsome other independently viable claim. SeeArchdiocese of\nWashingtonv.WMATA, 897 F.3d 314, 331 (CADC 2018) (A\n\u201chybrid rights claim .\u00a0.\u00a0. requires independently viable\nfree speech and free exercise claims\u201d);Gary S.v.Manchester School Dist.,374 F.3d 15, 19 (CA1 2004) (adopting District Court\u2019s reasoning\nthat \u201cthe [hybrid-rights] exception can be invoked only if the\nplaintiff has joined a free exercise challenge with another\nindependently viable constitutional claim,\u201d241 F. Supp. 2d 111, 121 (NH 2003));Brownv.Hot,\nSexy and Safer Productions,68 F.3d 525, 539 (CA1 1995). But this approach essentially\nmakes the free-exercise claim irrelevant. SeeAxson-Flynnv.Johnson,356 F.3d 1277, 1296\u20131297 (CA10 2004) (\u201c[I]t makes no sense to\nadopt a strict standard that essentially requires asuccessfulcompanion claim because such a test would make\nthe free exercise claim unnecessary\u201d); see alsoLukumi, 508\nU.\u00a0S., at 567 (opinion of Souter, J.) (making the same\npoint).The third group requires that the\nnon-free-exercise claim be \u201ccolorable.\u201d SeeCornerstone\nChristian Schoolsv.University Interscholastic League,\n563 F.3d 127, 136, n.\u00a08 (CA5 2009);San Jose Christian\nCollegev.Morgan Hill,360 F.3d 1024, 1032\u20131033 (CA9 2004);Axson-Flynn,356\nF.\u00a03d, at 1295\u20131297. But what that means is obscure. See,e.g.,id., at 1295 (referring to \u201chelpful\u201d analogies\nsuch as the \u201c\u00a0\u2018likelihood of success on the merits\u2019 standard\nfor preliminary injunctions\u201d or the pre-Antiterrorism and Effective\nDeath Penalty Act standard for obtaining an evidentiary hearing,i.e., a \u201c\u00a0\u2018colorable showing of factual\ninnocence\u2019\u00a0\u201d).[78]It is rare to encounter a holding of this Court\nthat has so thoroughly stymied or elicited such open derision from\nthe Courts of Appeals.2Rules that \u201ctarget\u201d religion.\nPost-Smithcases have also struggled with the task of\ndetermining whether a purportedly neutral rule \u201ctargets\u201d religious\nexercise or has the restriction of religious exercise as its\n\u201cobject.\u201dLukumi, 508 U.\u00a0S., at 534;Smith, 494\nU.\u00a0S., at 878. A threshold question is whether \u201ctargeting\u201d\ncalls for an objective or subjective inquiry. Must \u201ctargeting\u201d be\nassessed based solely on the terms of the relevant rule or rules?\nOr can evidence of the rulemakers\u2019 motivation be taken into\naccount? If subjective motivations may be considered, does it\nmatter whether the challenged state action is an adjudication, the\npromulgation of a rule, or the enactment of legislation? Should\ncourts consider the motivations of only the officials who took the\nchallenged action, or may they also take into account comments by\nsuperiors and others in a position of influence? And what degree of\nhostility to religion or a religious group is required to prove\n\u201ctargeting\u201d?The genesis of this problem wasSmith\u2019s\nholding that a rule is not neutral \u201cif prohibiting the exercise of\nreligion\u201d is its \u201cobject.\u201d 494 U.\u00a0S., at 878.Smithdid\nnot elaborate on what that meant, and later inLukumi, which\nconcerned city ordinances that burdened the practice of Santeria,\n508 U.\u00a0S., at 525\u2013528, Justices in theSmithmajority\nadopted different interpretations. Justice Scalia and Chief Justice\nRehnquist took the position that the \u201cobject\u201d of a rule must be\ndetermined by its terms and that evidence of the rulemakers\u2019\nmotivation should not be considered. 508 U.\u00a0S., at 557\u2013559.\nThis interpretation had the disadvantage of allowing skillful\nrulemakers to target religious exercise by devising a facially\nneutral rule that applies to both the targeted religious conduct\nand a slice of secular conduct that can be burdened without\neliciting unacceptable opposition from those whose interests are\naffected.The alternative to this approach takes courts\ninto the difficult business of ascertaining the subjective\nmotivations of rulemakers. InLukumi, Justices Kennedy and\nStevens took that path and relied on numerous statements by council\nmembers showing that their object was to ban the practice of\nSanteria within the city\u2019s borders.Id.,at 540\u2013542. Thus,Lukumileft the meaning of a rule\u2019s \u201cobject\u201d up in the\nair.When the issue returned inMasterpiece\nCakeshop, the question was only partially resolved. Holding\nthat the Colorado Civil Rights Commission violated the\nfree-exercise rights of a baker who refused for religious reasons\nto create a cake for a same-sex wedding, the Court pointed to\ndisparaging statements made by commission members, and the Court\nnoted that these comments, \u201cby an adjudicatory body deciding a\nparticular case,\u201d \u201cwere made in a very different context\u201d from the\nremarks by the council members inLukumi.Masterpiece\nCakeshop,584 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 14). That is as\nfar as this Court\u2019s decisions have gone on the question of\ntargeting, and thus many important questions remain open.The present case highlights two\u2014specifically,\nwhich officials\u2019 motivations are relevant and what degree of\ndisparagement must be shown to establish unconstitutional\ntargeting. InMasterpiece Cakeshop, the commissioners\u2019\nstatements\u2014comparing the baker\u2019s actions to the Holocaust and\nslavery and suggesting that his beliefs were just an excuse for\nbigotry\u2014went too far.Id.,at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 12\u201314).\nBut what about the comments of Philadelphia officials in this case?\nThe city council labeled CSS\u2019s policy \u201cdiscrimination that occurs\nunder the guise of religious freedom.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 147a.\nThe mayor had said that the Archbishop\u2019s actions were not\n\u201cChristian,\u201d and he once called on the Pope \u201cto kick some ass\nhere.\u201dId., at 173a, 177a\u2013178a. In addition, the\ncommissioner of the Department of Human Services (DHS), who serves\nat the mayor\u2019s pleasure,[79]\ndisparaged CSS\u2019s policy as out of date and out of touch with Pope\nFrancis\u2019s teachings.[80]The Third Circuit found this evidence\ninsufficient. Although the mayor conferred with the DHS\ncommissioner both before and after her meeting with CSS\nrepresentatives, the mayor\u2019s remarks were disregarded because there\nwas no evidence \u201cthat he played adirectrole, or even asignificantrole, in the process.\u201d 922 F.\u00a03d, at 157\n(emphasis added). The city council\u2019s suggestion that CSS\u2019s\nreligious liberty claim was a \u201cguise\u201d for discrimination was found\nto \u201cfal[l] into [a] grey zone,\u201d and the commissioner\u2019s debate with\na CSS representative about up-to-date Catholic teaching, which\n\u201csome might think .\u00a0.\u00a0. improper\u201d \u201cif taken out of\ncontext\u201d was \u201cbest viewed as an effort to reach common ground with\n[CSS] by appealing to an authority within their shared religious\ntradition.\u201dIbid. One may agree or disagree with the Third\nCircuit\u2019s characterization and evaluation of the statements of the\nCity officials, but the court\u2019s analysis highlights the extremely\nimpressionistic inquiry thatSmith\u2019s targeting requirement\nmay entail.Confusion and disagreement about \u201ctargeting\u201d\nhave surfaced in other cases. Recently inRoman Catholic Diocese\nof Brooklynv. Cuomo, 592 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2020)\n(per\u00a0curiam), there were conflicting views about\ncomments made by the Governor of New York. On the day before he\nseverely restricted religious services in Brooklyn, the Governor\n\u201csaid that if the \u2018ultra-Orthodox [Jewish] community\u2019 would not\nagree to enforce the rules, \u2018then we\u2019ll close the institutions\ndown.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAgudath Israel of Americav.Cuomo, 980\nF.3d 222, 229 (CA2 2020)\u00a0 (Park, J., dissenting).

That case featured strong evidence that pro-life\nChristian pharmacists who refused to dispense emergency\ncontraceptives were the object of a new rule requiring every\npharmacy to dispense every Food and Drug Administration-approved\ndrug.

Some decisions apply\nthis special rule if multiple secular exemptions are granted. See,e.g.,Horenv.Commonwealth, 23 Va. App. 735,\n743\u2013744, 479 S.E.2d 553, 557 (1997);Raderv.Johnston,924 F.

And still others have applied the\nrule where the law, although allowing no exemptions on its face,\nwas widely unenforced in cases involving secular conduct. See,e.g.,Tenafly Eruv Assn., 309 F.\u00a03d, at\n167\u2013168.4Identifying appropriate comparators. To\ndetermine whether a law provides equal treatment for secular and\nreligious conduct, two steps are required. First, a court must\nidentify the secular conduct with which the religious conduct is to\nbe compared. Second, the court must determine whether the State\u2019s\nreasons for regulating the religious conduct apply with equal force\nto the secular conduct with which it is compared. SeeLukumi, 508 U.\u00a0S., at 543. InSmith, this\ninquiry undoubtedly seemed straightforward: The secular conduct and\nthe religious conduct prohibited by the Oregon criminal statute\nwere identical. But things are not always that simple.Cases involving rules designed to slow the\nspread of COVID\u201319 have driven that point home. State and local\nrules adopted for this purpose have typically imposed different\nrestrictions for different categories of activities. Sometimes\nreligious services have been placed in a category with certain\nsecular activities, and sometimes religious services have been\ngiven a separate category of their own. To determine whether\nCOVID\u201319 rules provided neutral treatment for religious and secular\nconduct, it has been necessary to compare the restrictions on\nreligious services with the restrictions on secular activities that\npresent a comparable risk of spreading the virus, and identifying\nthe secular activities that should be used for comparison has been\nhotly contested.InSouth Bay United Pentecostal Churchv.

Experience\nhas shown otherwise.DSubsequent developments. Developments\nsinceSmithprovide additional reasons for changing course.\nTheSmithmajority thought that adherence toSherbertwould invite \u201canarchy,\u201d 494 U.\u00a0S., at 888, but experience has\nshown that this fear was not well founded. Both RFRA and RLUIPA\nimpose essentially the same requirements asSherbert, and we\nhave observed that the courts are well \u201cup to the task\u201d of applying\nthat test.Gonzalesv.O Centro Esp\u00edrita Beneficente\nUni\u00e3o do Vegetal,546 U.S.\n418, 436 (2006). See alsoCutterv.

WhenSmithwas decided, the available\nscholarship was thin, and the Court received no briefing on the\nsubject. Since then, scholars have explored the subject in great\ndepth.[81]*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*Multiple factors strongly favor overrulingSmith. Are there countervailing factors?ENone is apparent. Reliance is often the\nstrongest factor favoring the retention of a challenged precedent,\nbut no strong reliance interests are cited in any of the numerous\nbriefs urging us to preserveSmith. Indeed, the term is\nrarely even mentioned.All that the City has to say on the subject is\nthat overrulingSmithwould cause \u201csubstantial regulatory\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. disruption\u201d by displacing RFRA, RLUIPA, and related\nstate laws, Brief for City Respondents 51 (internal quotation marks\nomitted), but this is a baffling argument. How would overrulingSmithdisrupt the operation of laws that were enacted to\nabrogateSmith?One of the City\u2019samici, the New York\nState Bar Association, offers a different reliance argument. It\nclaims that some individuals, relying onSmith, have moved\nto jurisdictions with anti-discrimination laws that do not permit\nreligious exemptions. Brief for New York State Bar Association asAmicus Curiae11. The bar association does not cite any\nactual examples of individuals who fall into this category, and\nthere is reason to doubt that many actually exist.For the hypothesized course of conduct to make\nsense, all of the following conditions would have to be met. First,\nit would be necessary for the individuals in question to believe\nthat a religiously motivated party in the jurisdiction they left or\navoided might engage in conduct that harmed them. Second, this\nconduct would have to be conduct not already protected bySmithin that it (a) did not violate a generally applicable\nstate law, (b) that law did not allow individual exemptions, and\n(c) there was insufficient proof of religious targeting. Third, the\nfeared conduct would have to fall outside the scope of RLUIPA.\nFourth, the conduct, although not protected bySmith, would\nhave to be otherwise permitted by local law, for example, through a\nstate version of RFRA. Fifth, this fear of harm at the hands of a\nreligiously motivated actor would have to be a but-for cause of the\ndecision to move. Perhaps there are individuals who fall into the\ncategory that the bar association hypothesizes, but we should not\nallow violations of the Free Exercise Clause in perpetuity based on\nsuch speculation.Indeed, even if more substantial reliance could\nbe shown,Smith\u2019s dubious standing would weigh against\ngiving this factor too much weight.Smithhas been embattled\nsince the day it was decided, and calls for its reexamination have\nintensified in recent years. SeeMasterpiece Cakeshop,584\nU.\u00a0S., at ___ (Gorsuch, J., joined by Alito, J., concurring)\n(slip op., at 1);Kennedy, 586 U.\u00a0S., at ___\u2013___\n(Alito, J., joined by Thomas, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh, JJ.,\nconcurring in denial of certiorari) (slip op., at 5\u20136);City of\nBoerne521 U.\u00a0S., at 566 (Breyer, J., dissenting) (\u201c[T]he\nCourt should direct the parties to brief the question whether\n[Smith] was correctly decided\u201d);id., at 565\n(O\u2019Connor, J., joined by Breyer, J., dissenting) (\u201c[I]t is\nessential for the Court to reconsider its holding inSmith\u201d);Lukumi, 508 U.\u00a0S., at 559 (Souter, J.,\nconcurring in part and concurring in judgment) (\u201c[I]n a case\npresenting the issue, the Court should reexamine the ruleSmithdeclared\u201d). Thus, parties have long been on notice\nthat the decision might soon be reconsidered. SeeJanus,585\nU.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 45).*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*Smithwas wrongly decided. As long as\nit remains on the books, it threatens a fundamental freedom. And\nwhile precedent should not lightly be cast aside, the Court\u2019s error\ninSmithshould now be corrected.VIAIfSmithis overruled, what legal\nstandard should be applied in this case? The answer that comes most\nreadily to mind is the standard thatSmithreplaced: A law\nthat imposes a substantial burden on religious exercise can be\nsustained only if it is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling\ngovernment interest.Whether this test should be rephrased or\nsupplemented with specific rules is a question that need not be\nresolved here because Philadelphia\u2019s ouster of CSS from foster care\nwork simply does not further any interest that can properly be\nprotected in this case. As noted, CSS\u2019s policy has not hindered any\nsame-sex couples from becoming foster parents, and there is no\nthreat that it will do so in the future.CSS\u2019s policy has only one effect: It expresses\nthe idea that same-sex couples should not be foster parents because\nonly a man and a woman should marry. Many people today find this\nidea not only objectionable but hurtful. Nevertheless, protecting\nagainst this form of harm is not an interest that can justify the\nabridgment of First Amendment rights.We have covered this ground repeatedly in free\nspeech cases. In an open, pluralistic, self-governing society, the\nexpression of an idea cannot be suppressed simply because some find\nit offensive, insulting, or even wounding. SeeMatalv.Tam, 582 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___\u2013___ (2017) (slip op., at 1\u20132)\n(\u201cSpeech may not be banned on the ground that it expresses ideas\nthat offend\u201d);Hurley, 515 U.\u00a0S., at 579 (\u201c[T]he law\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. is not free to interfere with speech for no better\nreason than promoting an approved message or discouraging a\ndisfavored one, however enlightened either purpose may strike the\ngovernment\u201d);Johnson, 491 U.\u00a0S., at 414 (\u201cIf there is\na bedrock principle underlying the First Amendment, it is that the\ngovernment may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply\nbecause society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable\u201d);FCCv.Pacifica Foundation,438\nU.S. 726, 745 (1978) (opinion of Stevens, J.) (\u201c[T]he fact that\nsociety may find speech offensive is not a sufficient reason for\nsuppressing it. Indeed, if it is the speaker\u2019s opinion that gives\noffense, that consequence is a reason for according it\nconstitutional protection\u201d);Streetv.New York,394 U.S.\n576, 592 (1969) (\u201c[T]he public expression of ideas may not be\nprohibited merely because the ideas are themselves offensive to\nsome of their hearers\u201d); Cf.Coatesv.Cincinnati,402 U.S.\n611, 615 (1971) (\u201cOur decisions establish that mere public\nintolerance or animosity cannot be the basis for abridgment of\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. constitutional freedoms\u201d).The same fundamental principle applies to\nreligious practices that give offense. The preservation of\nreligious freedom depends on that principle. Many core religious\nbeliefs are perceived as hateful by members of other religions or\nnonbelievers. Proclaiming that there is only one God is offensive\nto polytheists, and saying that there are many gods is anathema to\nJews, Christians, and Muslims. Declaring that Jesus was the Son of\nGod is offensive to Judaism and Islam, and stating that Jesus was\nnot the Son of God is insulting to Christian belief. Expressing a\nbelief in God is nonsense to atheists, but denying the existence of\nGod or proclaiming that religion has been a plague is infuriating\nto those for whom religion is all-important.Suppressing speech\u2014or religious practice\u2014simply\nbecause it expresses an idea that some find hurtful is a zero-sum\ngame. While CSS\u2019s ideas about marriage are likely to be\nobjectionable to same-sex couples, lumping those who hold\ntraditional beliefs about marriage together with racial bigots is\ninsulting to those who retain such beliefs. InObergefellv. Hodges,576 U.S. 644 (2015), the majority made a\ncommitment. It refused to equate traditional beliefs about\nmarriage, which it termed \u201cdecent and honorable,\u201did., at\n672, with racism, which is neither. And it promised that\n\u201creligions, and those who adhere to religious doctrines, may\ncontinue to advocate with utmost, sincere conviction that, by\ndivine precepts, same-sex marriage should not be condoned.\u201dId., at 679. An open society can keep that promise while\nstill respecting the \u201cdignity,\u201d \u201cworth,\u201d and fundamental equality\nof all members of the community.Masterpiece Cakeshop, 584\nU.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 9).BOne final argument must be addressed.\nPhiladelphia and many of itsamicicontend that preservation\nof the City\u2019s policy is not dependent onSmith.They argue\nthat the City is simply asserting the right to control its own\ninternal operations, and they analogize CSS to either a City\nemployee or a contractor hired to perform an exclusively\ngovernmental function.This argument mischaracterizes the relationship\nbetween CSS and the City. The members of CSS\u2019s staff are not City\nemployees; the power asserted by the City goes far beyond a refusal\nto enter into a contract; and the function that CSS and other\nprivate foster care agencies have been performing for decades has\nnot historically been an exclusively governmental function. See,e.g.,Leshkov.Servis,423 F.3d 337, 343\u2013344 (CA3 2005) (\u201cNo aspect of providing care\nto foster children in Pennsylvania has ever been the exclusive\nprovince of the government\u201d);Rayburnv.Hogue,241 F.3d 1341, 1347 (CA11 2001) (acknowledging that foster care\nis not traditionally an exclusive state prerogative);Milburnv.Anne Arundel Cty. Dept. of Social Servs.,\n871 F.2d 474, 479 (CA4 1989) (same);Malachowskiv.Keene, 787 F.2d 704, 711 (CA1 1986) (same); see alsoIsmailv.County of Orange, 693 Fed. Appx. 507, 512\n(CA9 2017) (concluding that foster parents were not state actors).\nOn the contrary, States and cities were latecomers to this field,\nand even today, they typically leave most of the work to private\nagencies.The power that the City asserts is essentially\nthe power to deny CSS a license to continue to perform work that it\nhas carried out for decades and that religious groups have\nperformed since time immemorial. Therefore, the cases that provide\nthe basis for the City\u2019s argument\u2014such asGarcettiv.Ceballos,547 U.S.\n410(2006), andBoard of Comm\u2019rs, Wabounsee Cty. v.Umbehr,518 U.S.\n668(1996)\u2014are far afield.

Philadelphia\u2019s\nexclusion of CSS from foster care work violates the Free Exercise\nClause, and CSS is therefore entitled to an injunction barring\nPhiladelphia from taking such action.After receiving more than 2,500 pages of\nbriefing and after more than a half-year of post-argument\ncogitation, the Court has emitted a wisp of a decision that leaves\nreligious liberty in a confused and vulnerable state.

When the state court held that it was\nand reaffirmed its prior decision, 307 Ore. 68, 72\u201373,763 P.2d 146, 147\u2013148 (1988), the Court granted certiorari, 489\nU.S. 1077 (1989).25Justice Barrett makes the surprising\nclaim that \u201c[a] longstanding tenet of our free exercise\njurisprudence\u201d that \u201cpre-dates\u201dSmithis \u201cthat a law\nburdening religious exercise must satisfy strict scrutiny if it\ngives government officials discretion to grant individualized\nexemptions.\u201dAnte, at 2 (concurring opinion). If there\nreally were such a \u201clongstanding [pre-Smith] tenet,\u201d one\nwould expect to find cases stating that rule, but Justice Barrett\ndoes not cite even one such case. Instead, she claims to find\nsupport by reading between the lines of what the Court said in a\nfootnote inSherbert, 374 U.\u00a0S., at 401, n. 4, and a\nportion of the opinion inCantwellv.Connecticut,310 U.S.\n296, 303\u2013307 (1940)).Ante, at 2. But even a close\ninterlinear reading of those cases yields no evidence of this\nsupposed tenet. In theSherbertfootnote, the Court\nresponded to the dissent\u2019s argument that South Carolina law did not\nrecognize any exemptions from the general eligibility requirement\nfor unemployment benefits. 374 U.\u00a0S., at 419\u2013420 (Harlan, J.,\ndissenting). The footnote expressed skepticism about this\ninterpretation of South Carolina law, but it did not suggest that\nits analysis would have been any different if the dissent\u2019s\ninterpretation were correct. InCantwell, the Court\naddressed the constitutionality of a state statute that generally\nprohibited the solicitation of funds for religious purposes unless\na public official found in advance that the cause was authentically\nreligious. See 310 U.\u00a0S., at 300\u2013302. The Court held that the\nFree Exercise Clause prohibited the State from conditioning\npermission to solicit funds on an administrative finding about a\nreligious group\u2019s authenticity, but the Court did not suggest that\na blanket ban on solicitation would have necessarily been\nsustained. On the contrary, it said that the State was \u201cfree to\nregulatethe time and mannerof solicitation generally, in\nthe interest of public safety, peace, comfort or convenience.\u201dId., at 307\u2013308 (emphasis added). And the Court said not one\nword about \u201cstrict scrutiny,\u201d a concept that was foreign to Supreme\nCourt case law at that time. See Fallon, Strict Judicial Scrutiny,\n54 UCLA L. Rev. 1267, 1284 (2007) (\u201cBefore 1960, what we would now\ncall strict judicial scrutiny .\u00a0.\u00a0. did not\nexist\u201d).26A\nparticularly heartbreaking example was a case in which a judge felt\ncompelled bySmithto reverse his previous decision holding\nthe state medical examiner liable for performing the autopsy of a\nyoung Hmong man who had been killed in a car accident. The young\nman\u2019s parents were tortured by the thought that the autopsy would\nprevent their sonfrom entering the afterlife. SeeYangv.Sturner,750 F. Supp. 558,560(RI 1990); see also 139 Cong. Rec. 9681 (1993) (remarks of\nRep. Edwards). Members of Congress were also informed that\nveterans\u2019 cemeteries had refused to allow burial on weekends even\nwhen that was required by the deceased\u2019s religion,id., at\n9687 (remarks of Rep. Cardin), and that churches were prohibited\nfrom conducting services in areas zoned for commercial and\nindustrial uses,id., at 9684 (remarks of Rep. Schumer). In\njust the first three years afterSmith, more than 50 cases\nwere decided against religious claimants. 139 Cong. Rec., at 9685\n(remarks of Rep. Hoyer); see alsoid.,at 9684 (remarks of\nRep. Schumer) (\u201cSmith was a devastating blow to religious\nfreedom\u201d).27Although the First Amendment refers\nto \u201cCongress,\u201d we have held that the Fourteenth Amendment\u2014which\nreferences the entire \u201cState,\u201d not just a legislature\u2014makes the\nrights protected by the Amendment applicable to the States.Gitlowv.New York,268 U.S.\n652(1925);Hamiltonv.Regents of Univ. of Cal.,293 U.S.\n245(1934);Cantwell,310 U.S.\n296;Eversonv.Board of Ed. of Ewing,330 U.S. 1(1947). And we have long applied that Amendment to actions taken by\nthose responsible for enforcing the law. See,e.g.,Lyngv.Northwest Indian Cemetery Protective Assn.,485 U.S.\n439(1988) (considering First Amendment claim based on federal\nagency\u2019s decision);Thomasv.Review Bd. of Ind.\nEmployment Security Div.,450 U.S.\n707(1981) (applying First Amendment against a state agency);Pickeringv.Board of Ed. of Township High School Dist.\n205,Will Cty.,391 U.S.\n563(1968) (applying First Amendment against local board of\neducation); see also U.\u00a0S. Const., Amdt. 14, \u00a71 (\u201cNo State\nshall makeor enforceany law which shall abridge the\nprivileges or immunities of citizens of the United States\u201d\n(emphasis added)).28The\nphrase \u201cno law\u201d applies to the freedom of speech and the freedom of\nthe press, as well as the right to the free exercise of religion,\nand there is no reason to believe that its meaning with respect to\nall these rights is not the same. With respect to the freedom of\nspeech, we have long held that \u201cno law\u201d does not mean that every\nrestriction on what a person may say or write is unconstitutional.\nSee,e.g.,Millerv.California,413 U.S.\n15, 23 (1973); see alsoFederal Election Comm\u2019nv.Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc.,551 U.S.\n449, 482 (2007) (opinion of Roberts, C.\u00a0J.);Times Film\nCorp.v.Chicago,365 U.S.\n43, 47\u201349 (1961). Many restrictions on what a person could\nlawfully say or write were well established at the time of the\nadoption of the First Amendment and have continued to this day.\nFraudulent speech, speech integral to criminal conduct, speech\nsoliciting bribes, perjury, speech threatening physical injury, and\nobscenity are examples. See,e.g.,Donaldsonv.Read Magazine, Inc.,333 U.S.\n178, 190\u2013191 (1948) (fraud);Giboneyv.Empire\nStorage & Ice Co.,336 U.S.\n490, 498 (1949) (speech integral to criminal conduct);McCutcheonv.Federal Election Comm\u2019n,572 U.S.\n185, 191\u2013192 (2014) (plurality opinion) (quid pro quobribes);United Statesv.Dunnigan,507 U.S.\n87, 96\u201397 (1993) (perjury);Virginiav.Black,538 U.S.\n343, 359 (2003) (threats);Miller, 413 U.\u00a0S., at 23\n(obscenity). The First Amendment has never been thought to have\ndone away with all these rules. Alexander Meiklejohn reconciled\nthis conclusion with the constitutional text: The First Amendment\n\u201cdoes not forbid the abridging of speech. But, at the same time, it\ndoes forbid the abridging of the freedom of speech.\u201d Free Speech\nand Its Relation to Self-Government 19 (1948) (emphasis deleted).\nIn other words, the Free Speech Clause protects a right that was\nunderstood at the time of adoption to have certain defined limits.\nSeeKonigsbergv.State Bar of Cal.,366 U.S.\n36, 49, and n. 10 (1961). As explained below, the same is true\nof the Free Exercise Clause. Seeinfra, at 28\u201336. No one has\never seriously argued that the Free Exercise Clause protects every\nconceivable religious practice or even every conceivable form of\nworship, including such things as human sacrifice.29Whatever the outer boundaries of the\nterm \u201creligion\u201d as used in the First Amendment, there can be no\ndoubt that CSS\u2019s contested policy represents an exercise of\n\u201creligion.\u201d30See\nalso N.

See,e.g., 1 Johnson (6th ed. 1785) (\u201cThat general security and\nquiet which the king warrants to his subjects, and of which he\ntherefore avenges the violation; every forcible injury is a breach\nof the king\u2019s peace\u201d (emphasis deleted)); 5 G. Jacob,\nLaw-Dictionary (1811) (\u201c[P]articularly in law, [\u2018peace\u2019] intends a\nquiet behaviour towards the King and his Subjects\u201d); Bailey\n(defining \u201cpeace\u201d in the \u201cLaw Sense\u201d as \u201cquiet and\ninoffensive Behaviour towards King and Subject\u201d).55Such\nan interpretation would also clash with the way in which the scope\nof state legislative power was understood. If any violation of the\nlaw had been regarded as a breach of public peace or safety, there\nwould have been no need for the lawmaking authority of a state\nlegislature to extend any further, but there is no evidence that\nstate legislative authority was understood that way. New York\u2019s\n1777 Constitution demonstrates the point. As noted above, it\nprotected free exercise unless a person invoked that protection to\n\u201cexcuse Acts of Licentiousness, or justify Practices inconsistent\nwith the Peace or Safety of this State.\u201d Art. XXXVIII, in Cogan 26.\nBut the New York Constitution authorized the legislature to enact\nlaws to further broader aims, including \u201cgood government, welfare,\nand prosperity.\u201d Art. XIX, in 5 Federal and State Constitutions\n2633 (F. Thorpe ed. 1909). That authority obviously goes well\nbeyond the prohibition of \u201cPractices inconsistent with\u201d the \u201cPeace\u201d\nand \u201cSafety\u201d (or \u201cLicentiousness\u201d). See McConnell, Freedom from\nPersecution 835\u2013836. In like manner, State Constitutions and other\ndeclarations of rights commonly proclaimed that government should\npursue broader goals, such as the promotion of \u201cprosperity\u201d and\n\u201chappiness.\u201d See Nestor, Table III: Comparing the Provisos to the\nScope of Legislative Power (online source archived at\nwww.supremecourt.gov).56Mayer, The Continental Army, in A\nCompanion to the American Revolution 309 (J.

But a\nprohibition of peyote use surely affected \u201cthe faith and mission\u201d\nof the Native American Church, which regards the ingestion of\npeyote as a sacrament.78Recently, some lower courts have\nproceeded under yet another approach, which analyzes whether the\nclaims presented are sufficiently similar to those raised in the\ncases that this Court purported to distinguish inSmith.
