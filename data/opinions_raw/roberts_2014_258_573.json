JOHN FUND, INC., fka ARCHDIOCESE OF MILWAUKEE SUPPORTING\nFUND, INC.on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the fifth circuit[June 23, 2014]Chief Justice Roberts\ndelivered the opinion of the Court.Investors can recover\ndamages in a private securities fraud action only if they prove\nthat they relied on the defendant\u2019s misrepresentation in\ndeciding to buy or sell a company\u2019s stock. In Basic Inc. v.\nLevinson, 485 U.\u00a0S. 224 (1988) , we held that investors could\nsatisfy this reliance requirement by invoking a presumption that\nthe price of stock traded in an efficient market reflects all\npublic, material information\u2014including material\nmisstatements. In such a case, we concluded, anyone who buys or\nsells the stock at the market price may be considered to have\nrelied on those misstatements.We also held, however,\nthat a defendant could rebut this presumption in a number of ways,\nincluding by showing that the alleged misrepresentation did not\nactually affect the stock\u2019s price\u2014that is, that the\nmisrepresentation had no \u201cprice impact.\u201d The questions\npresented are whether we should overrule or modify Basic\u2019s\npresumption of reliance and, if not, whether defendants should\nnonetheless be afforded an opportunity in securities class action\ncases to rebut the presumption at the class certification stage, by\nshowing a lack of price impact.IRespondent Erica P.\nJohn Fund, Inc. (EPJ Fund), is the lead plaintiff in a putative\nclass action against Halliburton and one of its executives\n(collectively Halliburton) alleging violations of section 10(b) of\nthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 48Stat. 891, 15\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a778j(b), and Securities and Exchange\nCommission Rule 10b\u20135, 17 CFR \u00a7240.10b\u20135 (2013).\nAccording to EPJ Fund, between June 3, 1999, and December 7, 2001,\nHalliburton made a series of misrepresentations regarding its\npotential liability in asbestos litigation, its expected revenue\nfrom certain construction contracts, and the anticipated benefits\nof its merger with another company\u2014all in an attempt to\ninflate the price of its stock. Halliburton subsequently made a\nnumber of corrective disclosures, which, EPJ Fund contends, caused\nthe company\u2019s stock price to drop and investors to lose\nmoney.EPJ Fund moved to\ncertify a class comprising all investors who purchased Halliburton\ncommon stock during the class period. The District Court found that\nthe proposed class satisfied all the threshold requirements of\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a): It was sufficiently\nnumerous, there were common questions of law or fact, the\nrepresentative parties\u2019 claims were typical of the class\nclaims, and the representatives could fairly and adequately protect\nthe interests of the class. App. to Pet. for Cert. 54a. And except\nfor one difficulty, the court would have also concluded that the\nclass satisfied the requirement of Rule 23(b)(3) that \u201cthe\nquestions of law or fact common to class members predominate over\nany questions affecting only individual members.\u201d See id., at\n55a, 98a. The difficulty was that Circuit precedent required\nsecurities fraud plaintiffs to prove \u201closs\ncausation\u201d\u2014a causal connection between the\ndefendants\u2019 alleged misrepresentations and the\nplaintiffs\u2019 economic losses\u2014in order to invoke\nBasic\u2019s presumption of reliance and obtain class\ncertification. App. to Pet. for Cert. 55a, and n.\u00a02. Because\nEPJ Fund had not demonstrated such a connection for any of\nHalliburton\u2019s alleged misrepresentations, the District Court\nrefused to certify the proposed class. Id., at 55a, 98a. The United\nStates Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the denial\nof class certification on the same ground. Archdiocese of Milwaukee\nSupporting Fund, Inc. v. Halliburton Co., 597 F.\u00a03d 330\n(2010).We granted certiorari\nand vacated the judgment, finding nothing in \u201cBasic or its\nlogic\u201d to justify the Fifth Circuit\u2019s requirement that\nsecurities fraud plaintiffs prove loss causation at the class\ncertification stage in order to invoke Basic\u2019s presumption of\nreliance. Erica P. John Fund, Inc. v. Halliburton Co., 563\nU.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2011) (Halliburton I\u00a0) (slip op., at 6).\n\u201cLoss causation,\u201d we explained, \u201caddresses a\nmatter different from whether an investor relied on a\nmisrepresentation, presumptively or otherwise, when buying or\nselling a stock.\u201d Ibid. We remanded the case for the lower\ncourts to consider \u201cany further arguments against class\ncertification\u201d that Halliburton had preserved. Id., at ___\n(slip op., at 9).On remand, Halliburton\nargued that class certification was inappropriate because the\nevidence it had earlier introduced to disprove loss causation also\nshowed that none of its alleged misrepresentations had actually\naf-fected its stock price. By demonstrating the absence of any\n\u201cprice impact,\u201d Halliburton contended, it had rebutted\nBasic\u2019s presumption that the members of the proposed class\nhad relied on its alleged misrepresentations simply by buying or\nselling its stock at the market price. And without the benefit of\nthe Basic presumption, investors would have to prove reliance on an\nindividual basis, meaning that individual issues would predominate\nover common ones. The District Court declined to consider\nHalliburton\u2019s argument, holding that the Basic presumption\napplied and certifying the class under Rule 23(b)(3). App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 30a.The Fifth Circuit\naffirmed. 718 F.\u00a03d 423 (2013). The court found that\nHalliburton had preserved its price impact argument, but to no\navail. Id., at 435\u2013436. While acknowledging that\n\u201cHalliburton\u2019s price impact evidence could be used at\nthe trial on the merits to refute the presumption of\nreliance,\u201d id., at 433, the court held that Halliburton could\nnot use such evidence for that purpose at the class certification\nstage, id., at 435. \u201c[P]rice impact evidence,\u201d the\ncourt explained, \u201cdoes not bear on the question of common\nquestion predominance [under Rule 23(b)(3)], and is thus\nappropriately considered only on the merits after the class has\nbeen certified.\u201d Ibid.We once again granted\ncertiorari, 571 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2013), this time to resolve a\nconflict among the Circuits over whether securities fraud\ndefendants may attempt to rebut the Basic presumption at the class\ncertification stage with evidence of a lack of price impact. We\nalso accepted Halliburton\u2019s invitation to reconsider the\npresumption of reliance for securities fraud claims that we adopted\nin Basic.IIHalliburton urges us\nto overrule Basic\u2019s presumption of reliance and to instead\nrequire every securities fraud plaintiff to prove that he actually\nrelied on the defendant\u2019s misrepresentation in deciding to\nbuy or sell a company\u2019s stock. Before overturning a\nlong-settled precedent, however, we require \u201cspecial\njustification,\u201d not just an argument that the precedent was\nwrongly decided. Dickerson v. United States, 530 U.\u00a0S. 428,\n443 (2000) (internal quotation marks omitted). Halliburton has\nfailed to make that showing.ASection 10(b) of the\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Securities and Exchange\nCommission\u2019s Rule 10b\u20135 prohibit making any material\nmisstatement or omission in connection with the purchase or sale of\nany security. Although section 10(b) does not create an express\nprivate cause of action, we have long recognized an implied private\ncause of action to enforce the provision and its implementing\nregulation. See Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores, 421\nU.\u00a0S. 723, 730 (1975) . To recover damages for violations of\nsection 10(b) and Rule 10b\u20135, a plaintiff must prove\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018(1) a material misrepresentation or omission by\nthe defendant; (2) scienter; (3) a connection between the\nmisrepresentation or omission and the purchase or sale of a\nsecurity; (4) reliance upon the misrepresentation or omission; (5)\neconomic loss; and (6) loss causation.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Amgen\nInc. v. Connecticut Retirement Plans and Trust Funds, 568\nU.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 3\u20134) (quoting\nMatrixx Initiatives, Inc. v. Siracusano, 563 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___\n(2011) (slip op., at 9)).The reliance element\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018ensures that there is a proper connection\nbetween a defendant\u2019s misrepresentation and a\nplaintiff\u2019s injury.\u2019\u00a0\u201d 568 U.\u00a0S., at\n___ (slip op., at 4) (quoting Halliburton I, 563 U.\u00a0S., at ___\n(slip op., at 4)). \u201cThe traditional (and most direct) way a\nplaintiff can demonstrate reliance is by showing that he was aware\nof a company\u2019s statement and engaged in a relevant\ntransaction\u2014e.g., purchasing common stock\u2014based on that\nspecific misrepresentation.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op., at\n4).In Basic, however, we\nrecognized that requiring such direct proof of reliance\n\u201cwould place an unnecessarily unrealistic evidentiary burden\non the Rule 10b\u20135 plaintiff who has traded on an impersonal\nmarket.\u201d 485 U.\u00a0S., at 245. That is because, even\nassuming an investor could prove that he was aware of the\nmisrepresentation, he would still have to \u201cshow a speculative\nstate of facts, i.e., how he would have acted .\u00a0.\u00a0. if\nthe misrepresentation had not been made.\u201d Ibid.We also noted that\n\u201c[r]equiring proof of individualized reliance\u201d from\nevery securities fraud plaintiff \u201ceffectively would\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. prevent[ ] [plaintiffs] from proceeding with a\nclass action\u201d in Rule 10b\u20135 suits. Id., at 242. If\nevery plaintiff had to prove direct reliance on the\ndefendant\u2019s misrepresentation, \u201cindividual issues then\nwould .\u00a0.\u00a0. overwhelm[ ] the common ones,\u201d making\ncertification under Rule 23(b)(3) inappropriate. Ibid.To address these\nconcerns, Basic held that securities fraud plaintiffs can in\ncertain circumstances satisfy the reliance element of a Rule\n10b\u20135 action by invoking a rebuttable presumption of\nreliance, rather than proving direct reliance on a\nmisrepresentation. The Court based that presumption on what is\nknown as the \u201cfraud-on-the-market\u201d theory, which holds\nthat \u201cthe market price of shares traded on well-developed\nmarkets reflects all publicly available information, and, hence,\nany material misrepresentations.\u201d Id., at 246. The Court also\nnoted that, rather than scrutinize every piece of public\ninformation about a company for himself, the typical\n\u201cinvestor who buys or sells stock at the price set by the\nmarket does so in reliance on the integrity of that\nprice\u201d\u2014the belief that it reflects all public, material\ninformation. Id., at 247. As a result, whenever the investor buys\nor sells stock at the market price, his \u201creliance on any\npublic material misrepresentations .\u00a0.\u00a0. may be presumed\nfor purposes of a Rule 10b\u20135 action.\u201d Ibid.Based on this theory, a\nplaintiff must make the following showings to demonstrate that the\npresumption of reliance applies in a given case: (1) that the\nalleged misrepresentations were publicly known, (2) that they were\nmaterial, (3) that the stock traded in an efficient market, and (4)\nthat the plaintiff traded the stock between the time the\nmisrepresentations were made and when the truth was revealed. See\nid., at 248, n. 27; Halliburton I, supra, at ___ (slip op., at\n5\u20136).At the same time, Basic\nemphasized that the presumption of reliance was rebuttable rather\nthan conclusive. Specifically, \u201c[a]ny showing that severs the\nlink between the alleged misrepresentation and either the price\nreceived (or paid) by the plaintiff, or his decision to trade at a\nfair market price, will be sufficient to rebut the presumption of\nreliance.\u201d 485 U.\u00a0S., at 248. So for example, if a\ndefendant could show that the alleged misrepresentation did not,\nfor whatever reason, actually affect the market price, or that a\nplaintiff would have bought or sold the stock even had he been\naware that the stock\u2019s price was tainted by fraud, then the\npresumption of reliance would not apply. Id., at 248\u2013249. In\neither of those cases, a plaintiff would have to prove that he\ndirectly relied on the defendant\u2019s misrepresentation in\nbuying or selling the stock.BHalliburton contends\nthat securities fraud plaintiffs should always have to prove direct\nreliance and that the Basic Court erred in allowing them to invoke\na presumption of reliance instead. According to Halliburton, the\nBasic presumption contravenes congressional intent and has been\nundermined by subsequent developments in economic theory. Neither\nargument, however, so discredits Basic as to constitute\n\u201cspecial justification\u201d for overruling the\ndecision.1Halliburton first\nargues that the Basic presumption is inconsistent with\nCongress\u2019s intent in passing the 1934 Exchange Act. Because\n\u201c[t]he Section 10(b) action is a \u2018judicial construct\nthat Congress did not enact,\u2019\u00a0\u201d this Court,\nHalliburton insists, \u201cmust identify\u2014and borrow\nfrom\u2014the express provision that is \u2018most analogous to\nthe private 10b\u20135 right of action.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Brief\nfor Petitioners 12 (quoting Stoneridge Investment Partners, LLC v.\nScientific-Atlanta, Inc., 552 U.\u00a0S. 148, 164 (2008) ; Musick,\nPeeler& Garrett v. Employers Ins. of Wausau, 508 U.\u00a0S.\n286, 294 (1993) ). According to Halliburton, the closest analogueto\nsection 10(b) is section 18(a) of the Act, which cre-ates an\nexpress private cause of action allowing inves-tors to recover\ndamages based on misrepresentations made in certain regulatory\nfilings. 15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a778r(a). That provision\nrequires an investor to prove that he bought or sold stock\n\u201cin reliance upon\u201d the defendant\u2019s\nmisrepresentation. Ibid. In ignoring this direct reliance\nrequirement, the argument goes, the Basic Court relieved Rule\n10b\u20135 plaintiffs of a burden that Congress would have imposed\nhad it created the cause of action.EPJ Fund contests both\npremises of Halliburton\u2019s argument, arguing that Congress has\naffirmed Basic\u2019s construction of section 10(b) and that, in\nany event, the closest analogue to section 10(b) is not section\n18(a) but section 9, 15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a778i\u2014a\nprovision that does not require actual reliance.We need not settle this\ndispute. In Basic, the dissenting Justices made the same argument\nbased on section 18(a) that Halliburton presses here. See 485\nU.\u00a0S., at 257\u2013258 (White, J., concurring in part and\ndissenting in part). The Basic majority did not find that argument\npersuasive then, and Halliburton has given us no new reason to\nendorse it now.2Halliburton\u2019s\nprimary argument for overruling Basic is that the decision rested\non two premises that can no longer withstand scrutiny. The first\npremise concerns what is known as the \u201cefficient capital\nmarkets hypothesis.\u201d Basic stated that \u201cthe market\nprice of shares traded on well-developed markets reflects all\npublicly available information, and, hence, any material\nmisrepresentations.\u201d Id., at 246. From that statement,\nHalliburton concludes that the Basic Court espoused \u201ca robust\nview of market efficiency\u201d that is no longer tenable, for\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018overwhelming empirical evidence\u2019 now\n\u2018suggests that capital markets are not fundamentally\nefficient.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Brief for Petitioners 14\u201316\n(quoting Lev & de Villiers, Stock Price Crashes and 10b\u20135\nDamages: A Legal, Economic, and Policy Analysis, 47 Stan.\nL.\u00a0Rev 7, 20 (1994)). To support this contention, Halliburton\ncites studies purporting to show that \u201cpublic information is\noften not incorporated immediately (much less rationally) into\nmarket prices.\u201d Brief for Petitioners 17; see id., at\n16\u201320. See also Brief for Law Professors as Amici Curiae\n15\u201318.Halliburton does not,\nof course, maintain that capital markets are always inefficient.\nRather, in its view, Basic\u2019s fundamental error was to ignore\nthe fact that \u201c\u00a0\u2018efficiency is not a binary, yes\nor no question.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Brief for Petitioners 20\n(quoting Langevoort, Basic at Twenty: Rethinking Fraud on the\nMarket, 2009 Wis. L.\u00a0Rev. 151, 167)). The markets for some\nsecurities are more efficient than the markets for others, and even\na single market can process different kinds of information more or\nless efficiently, depending on how widely the information is\ndisseminated and how easily it is understood. Brief for Petitioners\nat 20\u201321. Yet Basic, Halliburton asserts, glossed over these\nnuances, assuming a false dichotomy that renders the presumption of\nreliance both underinclusive and overinclusive: A misrepresentation\ncan distort a stock\u2019s market price even in a generally\ninefficient market, and a misrepresentation can leave a\nstock\u2019s market price unaffected even in a generally efficient\none. Brief for Petitioners at 21.Halliburton\u2019s\ncriticisms fail to take Basic on its own terms. Halliburton focuses\non the debate among economists about the degree to which the market\nprice of a company\u2019s stock reflects public information about\nthe company\u2014and thus the degree to which an investor can earn\nan abnormal, above-market return by trading on such information.\nSee Brief for Financial Economists as Amici Curiae 4\u201310\n(describing the debate). That debate is not new. Indeed, the Basic\nCourt acknowledged it and declined to enter the fray, declaring\nthat \u201c[w]e need not determine by adjudication what economists\nand social scientists have debated through the use of sophisticated\nstatistical analysis and the application of economic\nthe-ory.\u201d 485 U.\u00a0S., at 246\u2013247, n.\u00a024. To\nrecognize the presumption of reliance, the Court explained, was not\n\u201cconclusively to adopt any particular theory of how quickly\nand completely publicly available information is reflected in\nmarket price.\u201d Id., at 248, n.\u00a028. The Court instead\nbased the presumption on the fairly modest premise that\n\u201cmarket professionals generally consider most publicly\nannounced material statements about companies, thereby affecting\nstock market prices.\u201d Id., at 247, n.\u00a024. Basic\u2019s\npresumption of reliance thus does not rest on a\n\u201cbinary\u201d view of market efficiency. Indeed, in making\nthe presumption rebuttable, Basic recognized that market efficiency\nis a matter of degree and accordingly made it a matter of\nproof.The academic debates\ndiscussed by Halliburton have not refuted the modest premise\nunderlying the presumption of reliance. Even the foremost critics\nof the efficient-capital-markets hypothesis acknowledge that public\ninformation generally affects stock prices. See, e.g., Shiller,\nWe\u2019ll Share the Honors, and Agree to Disagree, N.\u00a0Y.\nTimes, Oct. 27, 2013, p. BU6 (\u201cOf course, prices reflect\navailable information\u201d). Halliburton also conceded as much in\nits reply brief and at oral argument. See Reply Brief 13\n(\u201cmarket prices generally respond to new, material\ninformation\u201d); Tr. of Oral Arg. 7. Debates about the precise\ndegree to which stock prices accurately reflect public information\nare thus largely beside the point. \u201cThat the .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nprice [of a stock] may be inaccurate does not detract from the fact\nthat false statements affect it, and cause loss,\u201d which is\n\u201call that Basic requires.\u201d Schleicher v. Wendt, 618\nF.\u00a03d 679, 685 (CA7 2010) (Easterbrook, C. J.). Even though\nthe efficient capital markets hypothesis may have \u201cgarnered\nsubstantial criticism since Basic,\u201d post, at 6 (Thomas, J.,\nconcurring in judgment), Halliburton has not identified the kind of\nfundamental shift in economic the-ory that could justify overruling\na precedent on the ground that it misunderstood, or has since been\novertaken by, economic realities. Contrast State Oil Co. v. Khan,\n522 U.\u00a0S. 3 (1997) , unanimously overruling Albrecht v. Herald\nCo., 390 U.\u00a0S. 145 (1968) .Halliburton also\ncontests a second premise underlying the Basic presumption: the\nnotion that investors \u201cinvest \u2018in reliance on the\nintegrity of [the market] price.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Reply Brief 14\n(quoting 485 U.\u00a0S., at 247; alteration in original).\nHalliburton identifies a number of classes of investors for whom\n\u201cprice integrity\u201d is supposedly \u201cmarginal or\nirrelevant.\u201d Reply Brief 14. The primary example is the value\ninvestor, who believes that certain stocks are undervalued or\novervalued and attempts to \u201cbeat the market\u201d by buying\nthe undervalued stocks and selling the overvalued ones. Brief for\nPetitioners 15\u201316 (internal quotation marks omitted). See\nalso Brief for Vivendi S.\u00a0A. as Amicus Curiae 3\u201310\n(describing the investment strategies of day trad-ers, volatility\narbitragers, and value investors). If many investors \u201care\nindifferent to prices,\u201d Halliburton contends, then courts\nshould not presume that investors rely on the integrity of those\nprices and any misrepresentations incorporated into them. Reply\nBrief 14.But Basic never denied\nthe existence of such investors. As we recently explained, Basic\nconcluded only that \u201cit is reasonable to presume that most\ninvestors\u2014knowing that they have little hope of outperforming\nthe market in the long run based solely on their analysis of\npublicly available information\u2014will rely on the\nsecurity\u2019s market price as an unbiased assessment of the\nsecurity\u2019s value in light of all public information.\u201d\nAmgen, 568 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 5) (emphasis\nadded).In any event, there is\nno reason to suppose that even Halliburton\u2019s main\ncounterexample\u2014the value investor\u2014is as indifferent to\nthe integrity of market prices as Halliburton suggests. Such an\ninvestor implicitly relies on the fact that a stock\u2019s market\nprice will eventually reflect material information\u2014how else\ncould the market correction on which his profit depends occur? To\nbe sure, the value investor \u201cdoes not believe that the market\nprice accurately reflects public information at the time he\ntransacts.\u201d Post, at 11. But to indirectly rely on a\nmisstatement in the sense relevant for the Basic presumption, he\nneed only trade stock based on the belief that the market price\nwill incorporate public information within a reasonable period. The\nvalue investor also presumably tries to estimate how undervalued or\novervalued a particular stock is, and such estimates can be skewed\nby a market price tainted by fraud.CThe principle of\nstare decisis has \u201c\u00a0\u2018special\nforce\u2019\u00a0\u201d \u201cin respect to statutory\ninterpretation\u201d because \u201c\u00a0\u2018Congress remains\nfree to alter what we have done.\u2019\u00a0\u201d John R. Sand\n& Gravel Co. v. United States, 552 U.\u00a0S. 130, 139 (2008)\n(quoting Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U.\u00a0S. 164\n\u2013173 (1989)). So too with Basic\u2019s presumption of\nreliance. Although the presumption is a judicially created doctrine\ndesigned to implement a judicially created cause of action, we have\ndescribed the presumption as \u201ca substantive doctrine of\nfederal securities-fraud law.\u201d Amgen, supra, at ___ (slip\nop., at 5). That is because it provides a way of satisfying the\nreliance element of the Rule 10b\u20135 cause of action. See,\ne.g., Dura Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Broudo, 544 U.\u00a0S. 336\n\u2013342 (2005). As with any other element of that cause of\naction, Congress may overturnor modify any aspect of our\ninterpretations of the reli-ance requirement, including the Basic\npresumption it-self. Given that possibility, we see no reason to\nexempt the Basic presumption from ordinary principles of stare\ndecisis.To buttress its case\nfor overruling Basic, Halliburton contends that, in addition to\nbeing wrongly decided, the decision is inconsistent with our more\nrecent decisions construing the Rule 10b\u20135 cause of action.\nAs Halliburton notes, we have held that \u201cwe must give\n\u2018narrow dimensions .\u00a0.\u00a0. to a right of action\nCongress did not authorize when it first enacted the statute and\ndid not expand when it revisited the law.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Janus\nCapital Group, Inc. v. First Derivative Traders, 564 U.\u00a0S.\n___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 6) (quoting Stoneridge, 552\nU.\u00a0S., at 167); see, e.g., Central Bank of Denver, N.\u00a0A.\nv. First Interstate Bank of Denver, N.\u00a0A., 511 U.\u00a0S. 164\n(1994) (refusing to recognize aiding-and-abetting liability under\nthe Rule 10b\u20135 cause of action); Stoneridge, supra (refusing\nto extend Rule 10b\u20135 liability to certain secondary actors\nwho did not themselves make material misstatements). Yet the Basic\npresumption, Halliburton asserts, does just the opposite, expanding\nthe Rule 10b\u20135 cause of action. Brief for Petitioners\n27\u201329.Not so. In Central Bank\nand Stoneridge, we declined to extend Rule 10b\u20135 liability to\nentirely new categories of defendants who themselves had not made\nany material, public misrepresentation. Such an extension, we\nexplained, would have eviscerated the requirement that a plaintiff\nprove that he relied on a misrepresentation made by the defendant.\nSee Central Bank, supra, at 180; Stone-ridge, supra, at 157, 159.\nThe Basic presumption doesnot eliminate that requirement but rather\nprovides an alternative means of satisfying it. While the\npresumption makes it easier for plaintiffs to prove reliance, it\ndoes not alter the elements of the Rule 10b\u20135 cause of action\nand thus maintains the action\u2019s original legal scope.Halliburton also argues\nthat the Basic presumption cannot be reconciled with our recent\ndecisions governing class action certification under Federal Rule\nof Civil Procedure 23. Those decisions have made clear that\nplaintiffs wishing to proceed through a class action must actually\nprove\u2014not simply plead\u2014that their proposed class\nsatisfies each requirement of Rule 23, including (if applicable)\nthe predominance requirement of Rule 23(b)(3). See Wal-Mart Stores,\nInc. v. Dukes, 564 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 10);\nComcast Corp. v. Behrend, 569 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op.,\nat 5\u20136). According to Halliburton, Basic relieves Rule\n10b\u20135 plaintiffs of that burden, allowing courts to presume\nthat common issues of reliance predominate over individual\nones.That is not the effect\nof the Basic presumption. In securities class action cases, the\ncrucial requirement for class certification will usually be the\npredominance requirement of Rule 23(b)(3). The Basic presumption\ndoes not relieve plaintiffs of the burden of proving\u2014before\nclass certification\u2014that this requirement is met. Basic\ninstead establishes that a plaintiff satisfies that burden by\nproving the prerequisites for invoking the\npresumption\u2014namely, publicity, materiality, market\nefficiency, and market timing. The burden of proving those\nprerequisites still rests with plaintiffs and (with the exception\nof materiality) must be satisfied before class certification. Basic\ndoes not, in other words, allow plaintiffs simply to plead that\ncommon questions of reliance predominate over individual ones, but\nrather sets forth what they must prove to demonstrate such\npredominance.Basic does afford\ndefendants an opportunity to rebut the presumption of reliance with\nrespect to an individual plaintiff by showing that he did not rely\non the integrity of the market price in trading stock. While this\nhas the effect of \u201cleav[ing] individualized questions of\nreliance in the case,\u201d post, at 12, there is no reason to\nthink that these questions will overwhelm common ones and render\nclass certification inappropriate under Rule 23(b)(3). That the\ndefendant might attempt to pick off the occasional class member\nhere or there through individualized rebuttal does not cause\nindividual questions to predominate.Finally, Halliburton\nand its amici contend that, by facilitating securities class\nactions, the Basic presumption produces a number of serious and\nharmful consequences. Such class actions, they say, allow\nplaintiffs to extort large settlements from defendants for\nmeritless claims; punish innocent shareholders, who end up having\nto pay settlements and judgments; impose excessive costs on\nbusinesses; and consume a disproportionately large share of\njudicial resources. Brief for Petitioners 39\u201345.These concerns are more\nappropriately addressed to Congress, which has in fact responded,\nto some extent, to many of the issues raised by Halliburton and its\namici. Congress has, for example, enacted the Private Securities\nLitigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA), 109Stat. 737, which sought\nto combat perceived abuses in securities litigation with heightened\npleading requirements, limits on damages and attorney\u2019s fees,\na \u201csafe harbor\u201d for certain kinds of statements,\nrestrictions on the selection of lead plaintiffs in securities\nclass actions, sanctions for frivolous litigation, and stays of\ndiscovery pending motions to dismiss. See Amgen, 568 U.\u00a0S., at\n___ (slip op., at 19\u201320). And to prevent plaintiffs from\ncircumventing these restrictions by bringing securities class\nactions under state law in state court, Congress also enacted the\nSecurities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998, 112Stat. 3227,\nwhich precludes many state law class actions alleging securities\nfraud. See Amgen, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 20). Such legislation\ndemonstrates Congress\u2019s willingness to consider policy\nconcerns of the sort that Halliburton says should lead us to\noverrule Basic.IIIHalliburton proposes\ntwo alternatives to overruling Basic that would alleviate what it\nregards as the decision\u2019s most serious flaws. The first\nalternative would require plaintiffs to prove that a\ndefendant\u2019s misrepresentation actually affected the stock\nprice\u2014so-called \u201cprice impact\u201d\u2014in order to\ninvoke the Basic presumption. It should not be enough, Halliburton\ncontends, for plaintiffs to demonstrate the general efficiency of\nthe market in which the stock traded. Halliburton\u2019s second\nproposed alternative would allow defendants to rebut the\npresumption of reliance with evidence of a lack of price impact,\nnot only at the merits stage\u2014which all agree defendants may\nalready do\u2014but also before class certification.AAs noted, to invoke\nthe Basic presumption, a plaintiff must prove that: (1) the alleged\nmisrepresentations were publicly known, (2) they were material, (3)\nthe stock traded in an efficient market, and (4) the plaintiff\ntraded the stock between when the misrepresentations were made and\nwhen the truth was revealed. See Basic, 485 U.\u00a0S., at 248, n.\n27; Amgen, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 15). Each of these\nrequirements follows from the fraud-on-the-market theory underlying\nthe presumption. If the misrepresentation was not publicly known,\nthen it could not have distorted the stock\u2019s market price. So\ntoo if the misrepresentation was immaterial\u2014that is, if it\nwould not have \u201c\u00a0\u2018been viewed by the reasonable\ninvestor as having significantly altered the \u201ctotal\nmix\u201d of information made available,\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nBasic, supra, at 231\u2013232 (quoting TSC Industries, Inc. v.\nNorthway, Inc., 426 U.\u00a0S. 438, 449 (1976) )\u2014or if the\nmarket in which the stock traded was inefficient. And if the\nplaintiff did not buy or sell the stock after the misrepresentation\nwas made but before the truth was revealed, then he could not be\nsaid to have acted in reliance on a fraud-tainted price.The first three\nprerequisites are directed at price impact\u2014\u201cwhether the\nalleged misrepresentations affected the market price in the first\nplace.\u201d Halliburton I, 563 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at\n8). In the absence of price impact, Basic\u2019s\nfraud-on-the-market theory and presumption of reliance collapse.\nThe \u201cfundamental premise\u201d underlying the presumption is\n\u201cthat an investor presumptively relies on a misrepresentation\nso long as it was reflected in the market price at the time of his\ntransaction.\u201d 563 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 7). If it\nwas not, then there is \u201cno grounding for any contention that\n[the] investor[ ] indirectly relied on th[at] misrepresentation[ ]\nthrough [his] reliance on the integrity of the market price.\u201d\nAmgen, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 17).Halliburton argues that\nsince the Basic presumption hinges on price impact, plaintiffs\nshould be required to prove it directly in order to invoke the\npresumption. Proving the presumption\u2019s prerequisites, which\nare at best an imperfect proxy for price impact, should not\nsuffice.Far from a modest\nrefinement of the Basic presumption, this proposal would radically\nalter the required showing for the reliance element of the Rule\n10b\u20135 cause of action. What is called the Basic presumption\nactually incorporates two constituent presumptions: First, if a\nplaintiff shows that the defendant\u2019s misrepresentation was\npublic and material and that the stock traded in a generally\nefficient market, he is entitled to a presumption that the\nmisrepresentation affected the stock price. Second, if the\nplaintiff also shows that he purchased the stock at the market\nprice during the relevant period, he is entitled to a further\npresumption that he purchased the stock in reliance on the\ndefendant\u2019s misrepresentation.By requiring plaintiffs\nto prove price impact directly, Halliburton\u2019s proposal would\ntake away the first constituent presumption. Halliburton\u2019s\nargument for doing so is the same as its primary argument for\noverruling the Basic presumption altogether: Because market\nefficiency is not a yes-or-no proposition, a public, material\nmisrepresentation might not affect a stock\u2019s price even in a\ngenerally efficient market. But as explained, Basic never suggested\notherwise; that is why it affords defendants an opportunity to\nrebut the presumption by showing, among other things, that the\nparticular misrepresentation at issue did not affect the\nstock\u2019s market price. For the same reasons we declined to\ncompletely jettison the Basic presumption, we decline to\neffectively jettison half of it by revising the prerequisites for\ninvoking it.BEven if plaintiffs\nneed not directly prove price impact to invoke the Basic\npresumption, Halliburton contends that defendants should at least\nbe allowed to defeat the presumption at the class certification\nstage through evidence that the misrepresentation did not in fact\naffect the stock price. We agree.1There is no dispute\nthat defendants may introduce such evidence at the merits stage to\nrebut the Basic presumption. Basic itself \u201cmade clear that\nthe presumption was just that, and could be rebutted by appropriate\nevidence,\u201d including evidence that the asserted\nmisrepresentation (or its correction) did not affect the market\nprice of the defendant\u2019s stock. Halliburton I, supra, at ___\n(slip op., at 5); see Basic, supra, at 248.Nor is there any\ndispute that defendants may introduce price impact evidence at the\nclass certification stage, so long as it is for the purpose of\ncountering a plaintiff\u00a0\u2019s showing of market efficiency,\nrather than directly rebutting the presumption. As EPJ Fund\nacknowledges, \u201c[o]f course .\u00a0.\u00a0. defendants can\nintroduce evidence at class certification of lack of price impact\nas some evidence that the market is not efficient.\u201d Brief for\nRespondent 53. See also Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae\n26.After all, plaintiffs\nthemselves can and do introduce evidence of the existence of price\nimpact in connection with \u201cevent\nstudies\u201d\u2014regression analyses that seek to show that the\nmarket price of the defendant\u2019s stock tends to respond to\npertinent publicly reported events. See Brief for Law Professors as\nAmici Curiae 25\u201328. In this case, for example, EPJ Fund\nsubmitted an event study of various episodes that might have been\nexpected to affect the price of Halliburton\u2019s stock, in order\nto demonstrate that the market for that stock takes account of\nmaterial, public information about the company. See App.\n217\u2013230 (describing the results of the study). The episodes\nexamined by EPJ Fund\u2019s event study included one of the\nalleged misrepresentations that form the basis of the Fund\u2019s\nsuit. See id., at 230, 343\u2013344. See also In\u00a0re\nXcelera.com Securities Litigation, 430 F.\u00a03d 503, 513 (CA1\n2005) (event study included effect of misrepresentation challenged\nin the case).Defendants\u2014like\nplaintiffs\u2014may accordingly submit price impact evidence prior\nto class certification. What defendants may not do, EPJ Fund\ninsists and the Court of Appeals held, is rely on that same\nevidence prior to class certification for the particular purpose of\nrebutting the presumption altogether.This restriction makes\nno sense, and can readily lead to bizarre results. Suppose a\ndefendant at the certification stage submits an event study looking\nat the impact on the price of its stock from six discrete events,\nin an effort to refute the plaintiffs\u2019 claim of general\nmarket efficiency. All agree the defendant may do this. Suppose one\nof the six events is the specific misrepresentation asserted by the\nplaintiffs. All agree that this too is perfectly acceptable. Now\nsuppose the district court determines that, despite the\ndefendant\u2019s study, the plaintiff has carried its burden to\nprove market efficiency, but that the evidence shows no price\nimpact with respect to the specific misrepresentation challenged in\nthe suit. The evidence at the certification stage thus shows an\nefficient market, on which the alleged misrepresentation had no\nprice impact. And yet under EPJ Fund\u2019s view, the\nplaintiffs\u2019 action should be certified and proceed as a class\naction (with all that entails), even though the fraud-on-the-market\ntheory does not apply and common reliance thus cannot be\npresumed.Such a result is\ninconsistent with Basic\u2019s own logic. Under Basic\u2019s\nfraud-on-the-market theory, market efficiency and the other\nprerequisites for invoking the presumption constitute an indirect\nway of showing price impact. As explained, it is appropriate to\nallow plaintiffs to rely on this indirect proxy for price impact,\nrather than requiring them to prove price impact directly, given\nBasic\u2019s rationales for recognizing a presumption of reliance\nin the first place. See supra, at 6\u20137, 16\u201317.But an indirect proxy\nshould not preclude direct evidence when such evidence is\navailable. As we explained in Basic, \u201c[a]ny showing that\nsevers the link between the alleged misrepresentation and\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. the price received (or paid) by the plaintiff\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. will be sufficient to rebut the presumption of\nreliance\u201d because \u201cthe basis for finding that the fraud\nhad been transmitted through market price would be gone.\u201d 485\nU.\u00a0S., at 248. And without the presumption of reliance, a Rule\n10b\u20135 suit cannot proceed as a class action: Each plaintiff\nwould have to prove reliance individually, so common issues would\nnot \u201cpredominate\u201d over individual ones, as required by\nRule 23(b)(3). Id., at 242. Price impact is thus an essential\nprecondition for any Rule 10b\u20135 class action. While Basic\nallows plaintiffs to establish that precondition indirectly, it\ndoes not require courts to ignore a defendant\u2019s direct, more\nsalient evidence showing that the alleged misrepresentation did not\nactually affect the stock\u2019s market price and, consequently,\nthatthe Basic presumption does not apply.2The Court of Appeals\nrelied on our decision in Amgen in holding that Halliburton could\nnot introduce evidence of lack of price impact at the class\ncertification stage. The question in Amgen was whether plaintiffs\ncould be required to prove (or defendants be permitted to disprove)\nmateriality before class certification. Even though materiality is\na prerequisite for invoking the Basic presumption, we held that it\nshould be left to the merits stage, because it does not bear on the\npredominance requirement of Rule 23(b)(3). We reasoned that\nmateriality is an objective issue susceptible to common, classwide\nproof. 568 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 11). We also noted that\na failure to prove materiality would necessarily defeat every\nplaintiff\u2019s claim on the merits; it would not simply preclude\ninvocation of the presumption and thereby cause individual\nquestions of reliance to predominate over common ones. Ibid. See\nalso id., at ___ (slip op., at 17\u201318). In this latter\nrespect, we explained, materiality differs from the publicity and\nmarket efficiency prerequisites, neither of which is necessary to\nprove a Rule 10b\u20135 claim on the merits. Id., at ___\u2013___\n(slip op., at 16\u201318).EPJ Fund argues that\nmuch of the foregoing could be said of price impact as well. Fair\nenough. But price impact differs from materiality in a crucial\nrespect. Given that the other Basic prerequisites must still be\nproved at the class certification stage, the common issue of\nmateriality can be left to the merits stage without risking the\ncertification of classes in which individual issues will end up\noverwhelming common ones. And because materiality is a discrete\nissue that can be resolved in isolation from the other\nprerequisites, it can be wholly confined to the merits stage.Price impact is\ndifferent. The fact that a misrepresentation \u201cwas reflected\nin the market price at the time of [the]\ntransaction\u201d\u2014that it had price impact\u2014is\n\u201cBasic\u2019s fundamental premise.\u201d Halliburton I, 563\nU.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 7). It thus has everything to do\nwith the issue of predominance at the class certification stage.\nThat is why, if reliance is to be shown through the Basic\npresumption, the publicity and market efficiency prerequisites must\nbe proved before class certification. Without proof of those\nprerequisites, the fraud-on-the-market theory underlying the\npresumption completely collapses, rendering class certification\ninappropriate.But as explained,\npublicity and market efficiency are nothing more than prerequisites\nfor an indirect showing of price impact. There is no dispute that\nat least such indirect proof of price impact \u201cis needed to\nensure that the questions of law or fact common to the class will\n\u2018predominate.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Amgen, 568 U.\u00a0S., at\n___ (slip op., at 10) (emphasis deleted); see id., at ___ (slip\nop., at 16\u201317). That is so even though such proof is also\nhighly relevant at the merits stage.Our choice in this\ncase, then, is not between allowing price impact evidence at the\nclass certification stage or relegating it to the merits. Evidence\nof price impact will be before the court at the certification stage\nin any event. The choice, rather, is between limiting the price\nimpact inquiry before class certification to indirect evidence, or\nallowing consideration of direct evidence as well. As explained, we\nsee no reason to artificially limit the inquiry at the\ncertification stage to indirect evidence of price impact.\nDefendants may seek to defeat the Basic presumption at that stage\nthrough direct as well as indirect price impact evidence.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*More than 25 years ago,\nwe held that plaintiffs could satisfy the reliance element of the\nRule 10b\u20135 cause of action by invoking a presumption that a\npublic, material misrepresentation will distort the price of stock\ntraded in an efficient market, and that anyone who purchases the\nstock at the market price may be considered to have done so in\nreliance on the misrepresentation. We adhere to that decision and\ndecline to modify the prerequisites for invoking the presumption of\nreliance. But to maintain the consistency of the presumption with\nthe class certification requirements of Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 23, defendants must be afforded an opportunity before\nclass certification to defeat the presumption through evidence that\nan alleged misrepresentation did not actually affect the market\nprice of the stock.Because the courts\nbelow denied Halliburton that opportunity, we vacate the judgment\nof the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit and remand the case\nfor further proceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.",
