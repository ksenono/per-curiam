We hold it does\nnot. Under \u00a720913(d), the Attorney General must apply SORNA\u2019s\nregistration requirements as soon as feasible to offenders\nconvicted before the statute\u2019s enactment. That delegation easily\npasses constitutional muster.ICongress has sought, for the past quarter\ncentury, to combat sex crimes and crimes against children through\nsex-offender registration schemes. In 1994, Congress first\nconditioned certain federal funds on States\u2019 adoption of\nregistration laws meeting prescribed minimum standards. See Jacob\nWetterling Crimes Against Children and Sexually Violent Offender\nRegistration Act, \u00a7170101, 108 Stat. 2038, 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a714071et\u00a0seq.(1994 ed.). Two years later, Congress\nstrengthened those standards, most notably by insisting that States\ninform local communities of registrants\u2019 addresses. See Megan\u2019s\nLaw, \u00a72, 110Stat. 1345, note following 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a713701\n(1994 ed., Supp. II). By that time, every State and the District of\nColumbia had enacted a sex-offender registration law. But the state\nstatutes varied along many dimensions, and Congress came to realize\nthat their \u201cloopholes and deficiencies\u201d had allowed over 100,000\nsex offenders (about 20% of the total) to escape registration. See\nH.\u00a0R. Rep. No. 109\u2013218, pt. 1, pp. 20, 23\u201324, 26 (2005)\n(referring to those sex offenders as \u201cmissing\u201d or \u201clost\u201d). In 2006,\nto address those failings, Congress enacted SORNA. See 120Stat.\n590, 34 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a720901et\u00a0seq.SORNA makes \u201cmore uniform and effective\u201d the\nprior \u201cpatchwork\u201d of sex-offender registration systems.Reynoldsv.United States,565\nU.S. 432, 435 (2012). The Act\u2019s express \u201cpurpose\u201d is \u201cto\nprotect the public from sex offenders and offenders against\nchildren\u201d by \u201cestablish[ing] a comprehensive national system for\n[their] registration.\u201d \u00a720901. To that end, SORNA covers more sex\noffenders, and imposes more onerous registration requirements, than\nmost States had before. The Act also backs up those requirements\nwith new criminal penalties. Any person required to register under\nSORNA who knowingly fails to do so (and who travels in interstate\ncommerce) may be imprisoned for up to ten years. See 18\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72250(a).The basic registration scheme works as follows.\nA \u201csex offender\u201d is defined as \u201can individual who was convicted of\u201d\nspecified criminal offenses: all offenses \u201cinvolving a sexual act\nor sexual contact\u201d and additional offenses \u201cagainst a minor.\u201d 34\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a720911(1), (5)(A), (7). Such an individual must\nregister\u2014provide his name, address, and certain other\ninformation\u2014in every State where he resides, works, or studies. See\n\u00a7\u00a720913(a), 20914. And he must keep the registration current, and\nperiodically report in person to a law enforcement office, for a\nperiod of between fifteen years and life (depending on the severity\nof his crime and his history of recidivism). See \u00a7\u00a720915,\n20918.Section 20913\u2014the disputed provision\nhere\u2014elaborates the \u201c[i]nitial registration\u201d requirements for sex\noffenders. \u00a7\u00a720913(b), (d). Subsection (b) sets out the general\nrule: An offender must register \u201cbefore completing a sentence of\nimprisonment with respect to the offense giving rise to the\nregistration requirement\u201d (or, if the offender is not sentenced to\nprison, \u201cnot later than [three] business days after being\nsentenced\u201d). Two provisions down, subsection (d) addresses (in its\ntitle\u2019s words) the \u201c[i]nitial registration of sex offenders unable\nto comply with subsection (b).\u201d The provision states:\u201cThe Attorney General shall have the\nauthority to specify the applicability of the requirements of this\nsubchapter to sex offenders convicted before the enactment of this\nchapter .\u00a0.\u00a0. and to prescribe rules for the registration\nof any such sex offenders and for other categories of sex offenders\nwho are unable to comply with subsection (b).\u201dSubsection (d), in other words, focuses on\nindividuals convicted of a sex offense before SORNA\u2019s enactment\u2014a\ngroup we will call pre-Act offenders. Many of these individuals\nwere unregistered at the time of SORNA\u2019s enactment, either because\npre-existing law did not cover them or because they had\nsuccessfully evaded that law (so were \u201clost\u201d to the system). Seesupra,at 2. And of those potential new registrants, many or\nmost could not comply with subsection (b)\u2019s registration rule\nbecause they had already completed their prison sentences. For the\nentire group of pre-Act offenders, once again, the Attorney General\n\u201cshall have the authority\u201d to \u201cspecify the applicability\u201d of\nSORNA\u2019s registration requirements and \u201cto prescribe rules for\n[their] registration.\u201dUnder that delegated authority, the Attorney\nGeneral issued an interim rule in February 2007, specifying that\nSORNA\u2019s registration requirements apply in full to \u201csex offenders\nconvicted of the offense for which registration is required prior\nto the enactment of that Act.\u201d 72 Fed. Reg. 8897. The final rule,\nissued in December 2010, reiterated that SORNA applies to all\npre-Act offenders. 75 Fed. Reg. 81850. That rule has remained the\nsame to this day.Petitioner Herman Gundy is a pre-Act offender.\nThe year before SORNA\u2019s enactment, he pleaded guilty under Maryland\nlaw for sexually assaulting a minor. After his release from prison\nin 2012, Gundy came to live in New York. But he never registered\nthere as a sex offender. A few years later, he was convicted for\nfailing to register, in violation of \u00a72250. He argued below (among\nother things) that Congress unconstitutionally delegated\nlegislative power when it authorized the Attorney General to\n\u201cspecify the applicability\u201d of SORNA\u2019s registration requirements to\npre-Act offenders. \u00a720913(d). The District Court and Court of\nAppeals for the Second Circuit rejected that claim, see 695 Fed.\nAppx. 639 (2017), as had every other court (including eleven Courts\nof Appeals) to consider the issue. We nonetheless granted\ncertiorari. 583 U.\u00a0S. __ (2018). Today, we join the consensus\nand affirm.IIArticle I of the Constitution provides that\n\u201c[a]ll legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a\nCongress of the United States.\u201d \u00a71. Accompanying that assignment of\npower to Congress is a bar on its further delegation. Congress,\nthis Court explained early on, may not transfer to another branch\n\u201cpowers which are strictly and exclusively legislative.\u201dWaymanv.Southard, 10 Wheat. 1, 42\u201343 (1825). But\nthe Constitution does not \u201cdeny[\u00a0] to the Congress the\nnecessary resources of flexibility and practicality [that enable\nit] to perform its function[s].\u201dYakusv.United\nStates,321 U.S.\n414, 425 (1944) (internal quotation marks omitted). Congress\nmay \u201cobtain[\u00a0] the assistance of its coordinate Branches\u201d\u2014and\nin particular, may confer substantial discretion on executive\nagencies to implement and enforce the laws.Mistrettav.United States,488 U.S.\n361, 372 (1989). \u201c[I]n our increasingly complex society,\nreplete with ever changing and more technical problems,\u201d this Court\nhas understood that \u201cCongress simply cannot do its job absent an\nability to delegate power under broad general directives.\u201dIbid.So we have held, time and again, that a statutory\ndelegation is constitutional as long as Congress \u201clay[s] down by\nlegislative act an intelligible principle to which the person or\nbody authorized to [exercise the delegated authority] is directed\nto conform.\u201dIbid.(quotingJ. W. Hampton, Jr., &\nCo. v.United States,276 U.S.\n394, 409 (1928); brackets in original).Given that standard, a nondelegation inquiry\nalways begins (and often almost ends) with statutory\ninterpretation. The constitutional question is whether Congress has\nsupplied an intelligible principle to guide the delegee\u2019s use of\ndiscretion. So the answer requires construing the challenged\nstatute to figure out what task it delegates and what instructions\nit provides. See,e.g.,Whitmanv.American\nTrucking Assns., Inc.,531 U.S.\n457, 473 (2001) (construing the text of a delegation to place\nconstitutionally adequate \u201climits on the EPA\u2019s discretion\u201d);American Power & Light Co.v.SEC,329 U.S.\n90, 104\u2013105 (1946) (interpreting a statutory delegation, in\nlight of its \u201cpurpose[,] factual background[, and] context,\u201d to\nprovide sufficiently \u201cdefinite\u201d standards). Only after a court has\ndetermined a challenged statute\u2019s meaning can it decide whether the\nlaw sufficiently guides executive discretion to accord with Article\nI. And indeed, once a court interprets the statute, it may find\nthat the constitutional question all but answers itself.That is the case here, because \u00a720913(d) does\nnot give the Attorney General anything like the \u201cunguided\u201d and\n\u201cunchecked\u201d authority that Gundy says. Brief for Petitioner 37, 45.\nThe provision, in Gundy\u2019s view, \u201cgrants the Attorney General\nplenary power to determine SORNA\u2019s applicability to pre-Act\noffenders\u2014to require them to register, or not, as she sees fit, and\nto change her policy for any reason and at any time.\u201dId.,at 42. If that were so, we would face a nondelegation question. But\nit is not. This Court has already interpreted \u00a720913(d) to say\nsomething different\u2014to require the Attorney General to apply SORNA\nto all pre-Act offenders as soon as feasible. SeeReynolds,\n565 U.\u00a0S., at 442\u2013443. And revisiting that issue yet more\nfully today, we reach the same conclusion. The text, considered\nalongside its context, purpose, and history, makes clear that the\nAttorney General\u2019s discretion extends only to considering and\naddressing feasibility issues. Given that statutory meaning,\nGundy\u2019s constitutional claim must fail. Section 20913(d)\u2019s\ndelegation falls well within permissible bounds.AThis is not the first time this Court has had\nto interpret \u00a720913(d). InReynolds, the Court considered\nwhether SORNA\u2019s registration requirements applied of their own\nforce to pre-Act offenders or instead applied only once the\nAttorney General said they did. We read the statute as adopting the\nlatter approach. But even as we did so, we made clear how far SORNA\nlimited the Attorney General\u2019s authority. And in that way, we\neffectively resolved the case now before us.Everything inReynoldsstarted from the\npremise that Congress meant for SORNA\u2019s registration requirements\nto apply to pre-Act offenders. The majority recounted SORNA\u2019s\n\u201cbasic statutory purpose,\u201d found in its text, as follows: \u201cthe\n\u2018establish[ment of] a comprehensive national system for the\nregistration of [sex] offenders\u2019 thatincludesoffenders who\ncommitted their offenses before the Act became law.\u201d 565\nU.\u00a0S., at 442 (quoting \u00a720901; emphasis and alterations in\noriginal; citation omitted). That purpose, the majority further\nnoted, informed SORNA\u2019s \u201cbroad[\u00a0]\u201d definition of \u201csex\noffender,\u201d which \u201cinclude[s] any \u2018individual whowasconvicted of a sex offense.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId.,at 442 (quoting\n\u00a720911(1); emphasis added). And those two provisions were at one\nwith \u201c[t]he Act\u2019s history.\u201dId.,at 442. Quoting statements\nfrom both the House and the Senate about the sex offenders then\n\u201clost\u201d to the system,Reynoldsexplained that the Act\u2019s\n\u201csupporters placed considerable importance upon the registration of\npre-Act offenders.\u201dIbid.In recognizing all this, the\nmajority (temporarily) bonded with the dissenting Justices, who\nfound it obvious that SORNA was \u201cmeant to cover pre-Act offenders.\u201dId.,at 448 (Scalia, J., dissenting). And indeed, the\ndissent emphasized that common ground, remarking that \u201cthe Court\nacknowledges\u201d and \u201crightly believes\u201d that registration of pre-Act\noffenders was \u201cwhat the statute sought to achieve.\u201dId.,at\n448\u2013449.[1]But if that was so, why had Congress (as the\nmajority held) conditioned the pre-Act offenders\u2019 duty to register\non a prior \u201cruling from the Attorney General\u201d?Id.,at 441.\nThe majority had a simple answer: \u201c[I]nstantaneousregistration\u201d of pre-Act offenders \u201cmight not prove feasible,\u201d or\n\u201c[a]t least Congress might well have so thought.\u201dId.,at\n440\u2013441, 443. Here, the majority explained that SORNA\u2019s\nrequirements diverged from prior state law. Seeid., at 440;supra,at 2. Some pre-Act offenders (as defined by SORNA)\nhad never needed to register before; others had once had to\nregister, but had fulfilled their old obligations. And still others\n(the \u201clost\u201d or \u201cmissing\u201d offenders) should have registered, but had\nescaped the system. As a result, SORNA created a \u201cpractical\nproblem[\u00a0]\u201d: It would require \u201cnewly registering or\nreregistering a large number of pre-Act offenders.\u201dReynolds, 565 U.\u00a0S., at 440 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). And attached to that broad feasibility concern was a more\ntechnical one. Recall that under SORNA \u201ca sex offender must\ninitially register before completing his \u2018sentence of\nimprisonment.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId.,at 439 (quoting \u00a720913(b)); seesupra,at 3. But many pre-Act offenders were already out of\nprison, so could not comply with that requirement. That inability\nraised questions about \u201chow[] the new registration requirements\napplied to them.\u201d 565 U.\u00a0S., at 441.\u201cCongress[\u2019s]\nsolution\u201d to both those difficulties was the same: Congress\n\u201c[a]sk[ed] the Department of Justice, charged with responsibility\nfor implementation, to examine [the issues] and to apply the new\nregistration requirements accordingly.\u201dIbid.On that understanding, the Attorney General\u2019s\nrole under \u00a720913(d) was important but limited: It was to apply\nSORNA to pre-Act offenders as soon as he thought it feasible to do\nso. That statutory delegation, the Court explained, would\n\u201cinvolve[] implementation delay.\u201dId.,at 443. But no more\nthan that. Congress had made clear in SORNA\u2019s text that the new\nregistration requirements would apply to pre-Act offenders. Seeid.,at 442\u2013445. So (the Court continued) \u201cthere was no\nneed\u201d for Congress to worry about the \u201cunrealistic possibility\u201d\nthat \u201cthe Attorney General would refuse to apply\u201d those\nrequirements on some excessively broad view of his authority under\n\u00a720913(d).Id.,at 444\u2013445. Reasonably read, SORNA enabled\nthe Attorney General only to address (as appropriate) the\n\u201cpractical problems\u201d involving pre-Act offenders before requiring\nthem to register.Id.,at 440. The delegation was a stopgap,\nand nothing more.[2]Gundy dismissesReynolds\u2019s relevance, but\nhis arguments come up short. To begin, he contends thatRey-\nnoldsspoke \u201ctentative[ly]\u201d\u2014with \u201cmight[s], may[s], or\ncould[s]\u201d\u2014about Congress\u2019s reasons for enacting \u00a720913(d). Reply\nBrief 11; seesupra,at 7 (quoting such phrases). Gundy\nconcludes from such constructions\u2014which are indeed present\u2014that the\nCourt was \u201cnot offering a definitive reading of the statute.\u201d Reply\nBrief 11. But the Court used those locutions to convey not its own\nuncertainty but Congress\u2019s. The point of the opinion was that\nCongress had questions about how best to phase SORNA\u2019s application\nto pre-Act offenders, so gave the Attorney General flexibility on\ntiming. The \u201cmights, mays, and coulds\u201d were there to describe the\nlegislative mindset responsible for \u00a720913(d), and thus formed part\nof the Court\u2019s own\u2014yes, \u201cdefinitive\u201d\u2014view of that provision\u2019s\nmeaning. Anticipating that explanation, Gundy falls back on the\nclaim that the Court\u2019s account of Congress\u2019s motivations \u201ccannot\nsupply the intelligible principle Congress failed to enact into\nlaw.\u201dId.,at 12 (citingWhitman, 531 U.\u00a0S., at\n473). But the Court inReynoldsdid not invent a standard\nCongress omitted. Rather, the Court read the statute to contain a\nstandard\u2014again, that the Attorney General should apply SORNA to\npre-Act offenders as soon as feasible. And as the next part of this\nopinion shows, in somewhat greater detail thanReynoldsthought necessary, we read the statute in the same way.BRecall again the delegation provision at\nissue. Congress gave the Attorney General authority to \u201cspecify the\napplicability\u201d of SORNA\u2019s requirements to pre-Act offenders.\n\u00a720913(d). And in the second half of the same sentence, Congress\ngave him authority to \u201cprescribe rules for the registration of any\nsuch sex offenders . . . who are unable to comply with\u201d subsection\n(b)\u2019s initial registration requirement.Ibid.What does the\ndelegation in \u00a720913(d) allow the Attorney General to do?The different answers on offer here reflect\ncompeting views of statutory interpretation. As noted above, Gundy\nurges us to read \u00a720913(d) to empower the Attorney General to do\nwhatever he wants as to pre-Act offenders: He may make them all\nregister immediately or he may exempt them from registration\nforever (or he may do anything in between). See Brief for\nPetitioner 41\u201342;supra,at 6. Gundy bases that argument on\nthe first half of \u00a720913(d), isolated from everything else\u2014from the\nsecond half of the same section, from surrounding provisions in\nSORNA, and from any conception of the statute\u2019s history and\npurpose.Reynoldstook a different approach (as does the\nGovernment here), understanding statutory interpretation as a\n\u201cholistic endeavor\u201d which determines meaning by looking not to\nisolated words, but to text in context, along with purpose and\nhistory.United Sav. Assn. of Tex.v.Timbers of Inwood\nForest Associates, Ltd.,484 U.S.\n365, 371 (1988).This Court has long refused to construe words\n\u201cin a vacuum,\u201d as Gundy attempts.Davisv.Michigan Dept.\nof Treasury,489 U.S.\n803, 809 (1989). \u201cIt is a fundamental canon of statutory\nconstruction that the words of a statute must be read in their\ncontext and with a view to their place in the overall statutory\nscheme.\u201dNational Assn. of Home Buildersv.Defenders of\nWildlife,551 U.S.\n644, 666 (2007) (internal quotation marks omitted); seeUtility Air Regulatory Groupv.EPA, 573 U.S. 302,\n321 (2014) (\u201c[R]easonable statutory interpretation must account for\nboth the specific context in which .\u00a0.\u00a0. language is used\nand the broader context of the statute as a whole\u201d (internal\nquotation marks omitted)). And beyond context and structure, the\nCourt often looks to \u201chistory [and] purpose\u201d to divine the meaning\nof language.Maracichv.Spears, 570 U.S. 48, 76\n(2013) (internal quotation marks omitted). That non-blinkered brand\nof interpretation holds good for delegations, just as for other\nstatutory provisions. To define the scope of delegated authority,\nwe have looked to the text in \u201ccontext\u201d and in light of the\nstatutory \u201cpurpose.\u201dNational Broadcasting Co.v.United\nStates,319 U.S.\n190, 214, 216 (1943) (internal quotation marks omitted); seeAmerican Power & Light, 329 U.\u00a0S., at 104 (stating\nthat the delegation at issue \u201cderive[d] much meaningful content\nfrom the purpose of the Act, its factual background and the\nstatutory context\u201d). In keeping with that method, we again do so\ntoday.So begin at the beginning, with the\n\u201c[d]eclaration of purpose\u201d that is SORNA\u2019s first sentence. \u00a720901.\nThere, Congress announced (asReynoldsnoted, seesupra,at 6\u20137) that \u201cto protect the public,\u201d it was\n\u201cestablish[ing] a comprehensive national system for the\nregistration\u201d of \u201csex offenders and offenders against children.\u201d\n\u00a720901. The term \u201ccomprehensive\u201d has a clear meaning\u2014something that\nis all-encompassing or sweeping. See,e.g.,Webster\u2019s Third\nNew International Dictionary 467 (2002) (\u201ccovering a matter under\nconsideration completely or nearly completely\u201d); New Oxford\nAmerican Dictionary 350 (2d ed. 2005) (\u201ccomplete; including all or\nnearly all elements or aspects of something\u201d). That description\ncould not fit the system SORNA created if the Attorney General\ncould decline, for any reason or no reason at all, to apply SORNA\nto all pre-Act offenders. After all, for many years after SORNA\u2019s\nenactment, the great majority of sex offenders in the country would\nbe pre-Act offenders. If Gundy were right, all of those offenders\ncould be exempt from SORNA\u2019s registration requirements. So the\nmismatch between SORNA\u2019s statement of purpose and Gundy\u2019s view of\n\u00a720913(d) is as stark as stark comes. Responding to that patent\ndisparity, Gundy urges us to ignore SORNA\u2019s statement of purpose\nbecause it is \u201clocated in the Act\u2019s preface\u201d rather than \u201ctied\u201d\nspecifically to \u00a720913(d). Brief for Petitioner 46. But the\nplacement of such a statement within a statute makes no difference.\nSee A. Scalia & B. Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of\nLegal Texts 220 (2012). Wherever it resides, it is \u201can appropriate\nguide\u201d to the \u201cmeaning of the [statute\u2019s] operative provisions.\u201dId.,at 218. And here it makes clear that SORNA was supposed\nto apply to all pre-Act offenders\u2014which precludes Gundy\u2019s\nconstruction of \u00a720913(d).The Act\u2019s definition of \u201csex offender\u201d (also\nnoted inReynolds, seesupra,at 7) makes the same\npoint. Under that definition, a \u201csex offender\u201d is \u201can individual\nwho was convicted of a sex offense.\u201d \u00a720911(1). Note the tense:\n\u201cwas,\u201d not \u201cis.\u201d This Court has often \u201clooked to Congress\u2019 choice\nof verb tense to ascertain a statute\u2019s temporal reach,\u201d including\nwhen interpreting other SORNA provisions.Carrv.United\nStates,560 U.S.\n438, 447\u2013448 (2010) (holding that because SORNA \u201csets forth\n[its] travel requirement in the present tense,\u201d the statute\u2019s\ncriminal penalties do not apply to a person whose interstate travel\npredated enactment); see,e.g.,United Statesv.Wilson,503 U.S.\n329, 333 (1992);Gwaltney of Smithfield, Ltd.v.Chesapeake Bay Foundation, Inc.,484 U.S.\n49, 57 (1987). Here, Congress\u2019s use of the past tense to define\nthe term \u201csex offender\u201d shows that SORNA was not merely\nforward-looking. The word \u201cis\u201d would have taken care of all future\noffenders. The word \u201cwas\u201d served to bring in the hundreds of\nthousands of persons previously found guilty of a sex offense, and\nthought to pose a current threat to the public. The tense of the\n\u201csex offender\u201d definition thus confirms that the delegation allows\nonly temporary exclusions, as necessary to address feasibility\nissues. Contra Gundy, it does not sweep so wide as to make a\nlaughingstock of the statute\u2019s core definition.The Act\u2019s legislative history backs up\neverything said above by showing that the need to register pre-Act\noffenders was front and center in Congress\u2019s thinking. (Once again,\ntheReynoldsmajority noted this history, but Justice\nScalia\u2019s dissent thought that was gilding the lily. Seesupra,at 7, and n. 1. He had a point, but we can\u2019t resist.)\nRecall that Congress designed SORNA to address \u201cloopholes and\ndeficiencies\u201d in existing registration laws. Seesupra,at\n2. And no problem attracted greater attention than the large number\nof sex offenders who had slipped the system. According to the House\nReport, \u201c[t]he most significant enforcement issue in the sex\noffender program is that over 100,000 sex offenders\u201d are\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018missing,\u2019 meaning that they have not complied with\u201d\nthen-current requirements. H. R. Rep. No. 109\u2013218, at 26. There is\na \u201cstrong public interest,\u201d the Report continued, in \u201chaving [those\noffenders] register with current information to mitigate the risks\nof additional crimes against children.\u201dId.,at 24. Senators\nstruck a similar chord in the debates preceding SORNA\u2019s passage,\nrepeatedly stressing that the new provisions would capture the\nmissing offenders. See,e.g.,152 Cong. Rec. 15338 (2006)\n(statement of Sen. Kyl) (\u201cThe penalties in this bill should be\nadequate to ensure that [the 100,000 missing offenders] register\u201d);id.,at 13050 (statement of Sen. Frist) (\u201cEvery day that we\ndon\u2019t have this national sex offender registry, these missing sex\npredators are out there somewhere\u201d). Imagine how surprising those\nMembers would have found Gundy\u2019s view that they had authorized the\nAttorney General to exempt the missing \u201cpredators\u201d from registering\nat all.With that context and background established, we\nmay return to \u00a720913(d). As we have noted, Gundy makes his stand\nthere (and there only), insisting that the lonesome phrase \u201cspecify\nthe applicability\u201d ends this case. Seesupra,at 10. But in\nso doing, Gundy ignores even the rest of the section that phrase is\nin. Both the title and the remaining text of that section pinpoint\none of the \u201cpractical problems\u201d discussed above: At the moment of\nSORNA\u2019s enactment, many pre-Act offenders were \u201cunable to comply\u201d\nwith the Act\u2019s initial registration requirements. \u00a720913(d);Reynolds, 565 U.\u00a0S., at 440; seesupra,at 8.\nThat was because, once again, the requirements assumed that\noffenders would be in prison, whereas many pre-Act offenders were\non the streets. In identifying that issue, \u00a720913(d) itself reveals\nthe nature of the delegation to the Attorney General. It was to\ngive him the time needed (if any) to address the various\nimplementation issues involved in getting pre-Act offenders into\nthe registration system. \u201cSpecify the applicability\u201d thus does not\nmean \u201cspecifywhetherto apply SORNA\u201d to pre-Act offenders\nat all, even though everything else in the Act commands their\ncoverage. The phrase instead means \u201cspecifyhowto apply\nSORNA\u201d to pre-Act offenders if transitional difficulties require\nsome delay. In that way, the whole of \u00a720913(d) joins the rest of\nSORNA in giving the Attorney General only time-limited latitude to\nexcuse pre-Act offenders from the statute\u2019s requirements. Under the\nlaw, he had to order their registration as soon as feasible.And no Attorney General has used (or,\napparently, thought to use) \u00a720913(d) in any more expansive way. To\nthe contrary. Within a year of SORNA\u2019s enactment (217 days, to be\nprecise), the Attorney General determined that SORNA would apply\nimmediately to pre-Act offenders. See Interim Rule, 72 Fed. Reg.\n8897;supra,at 4. That rule has remained in force ever\nsince (save for a technical change to one of the rule\u2019s\nillustrative examples). See Final Rule, 75 Fed. Reg.\n81850.[3] And at oral argument\nhere, the Solicitor General\u2019s office\u2014rarely in a hurry to agree to\nlimits on the Government\u2019s authority\u2014acknowledged that \u00a720913(d)\ndoes not allow the Attorney General to excuse a pre-Act offender\nfrom registering, except for reasons of \u201cfeasibility.\u201d Tr. of Oral\nArg. 41\u201342. We thus end up, on close inspection of the statutory\nscheme, exactly whereReynoldsleft us. The Attorney\nGeneral\u2019s authority goes to transition-period implementation\nissues, and no further.CNow that we have determined what \u00a720913(d)\nmeans, we can consider whether it violates the Constitution. The\nquestion becomes: Did Congress make an impermissible delegation\nwhen it instructed the Attorney General to apply SORNA\u2019s\nregistration requirements to pre-Act offenders as soon as feasible?\nUnder this Court\u2019s long-established law, that question is easy. Its\nanswer is no.As noted earlier, this Court has held that a\ndelegation is constitutional so long as Congress has set out an\n\u201cintelligible principle\u201d to guide the delegee\u2019s exercise of\nauthority.J. W. Hampton, Jr., & Co., 276 U. S., at 409;\nseesupra,at 5. Or in a related formulation, the Court has\nstated that a delegation is permissible if Congress has made clear\nto the delegee \u201cthe general policy\u201d he must pursue and the\n\u201cboundaries of [his] authority.\u201dAmerican Power & Light,\n329 U. S., at 105. Those standards, the Court has made clear, are\nnot demanding. \u201c[W]e have \u2018almost never felt qualified to\nsecond-guess Congress regarding the permissible degree of policy\njudgment that can be left to those executing or applying the\nlaw.\u2019\u00a0\u201dWhitman, 531 U. S., at 474\u2013475 (quotingMistretta, 488 U.\u00a0S., at 416 (Scalia, J., dissenting)).\nOnly twice in this country\u2019s history (and that in a single year)\nhave we found a delegation excessive\u2014in each case because \u201cCongress\nhad failed to articulateanypolicy or standard\u201d to confine\ndiscretion.Mistretta, 488 U.\u00a0S., at 373, n.\u00a07\n(emphasis added); seeA. L. A. Schechter Poultry Corp.v.United States,295 U.S.\n495(1935);Panama Refining Co.v.Ryan,293 U.S.\n388(1935). By contrast, we have over and over upheld even very\nbroad delegations. Here is a sample: We have approved delegations\nto various agencies to regulate in the \u201cpublic interest.\u201d See,e.g., National Broadcasting Co., 319 U. S., at 216;New\nYork Central Securities Corp.v.United States,287 U.S.\n12, 24 (1932). We have sustained authorizations for agencies to\nset \u201cfair and equitable\u201d prices and \u201cjust and reasonable\u201d rates.Yakus, 321 U. S., at 422, 427;FPCv.Hope Natural\nGas Co.,320 U.S.\n591(1944). We more recently affirmed a delegation to an agency\nto issue whatever air quality standards are \u201crequisite to protect\nthe public health.\u201dWhitman, 531 U.\u00a0S., at 472 (quoting\n42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a77409(b)(1)). And so forth.In that context, the delegation in SORNA easily\npasses muster (as all eleven circuit courts to have considered the\nquestion found, seesupra,at 4). The statute conveyed\nCongress\u2019s policy that the Attorney General require pre-Act\noffenders to register as soon as feasible. Under the law, the\nfeasibility issues he could address were administrative\u2014and, more\nspecifically, transitional\u2014in nature. Those issues arose, asReynoldsexplained, from the need to \u201cnewly register[\u00a0]\nor reregister[\u00a0] \u2018a large number\u2019 of pre-Act offenders\u201d not\nthen in the system. 565 U.\u00a0S., at 440; seesupra,at 8.\nAnd they arose, more technically, from the gap between an initial\nregistration requirement hinged on imprisonment and a set of\npre-Act offenders long since released. See 565 U.\u00a0S., at 441;\nseesupra,at 8. Even for those limited matters, the Act\ninformed the Attorney General that he did not have forever to work\nthings out. By stating its demand for a \u201ccomprehensive\u201d\nregistration system and by defining the \u201csex offenders\u201d required to\nregister to include pre-Act offenders, Congress conveyed that the\nAttorney General had only temporary authority. Or again, in the\nwords ofReynolds, that he could prevent\n\u201cinstantaneousregistration\u201d and impose some \u201cimplementation\ndelay.\u201d 565 U.\u00a0S., at 443. That statutory authority, as\ncompared to the delegations we have upheld in the past, is\ndistinctly small-bore. It falls well within constitutional\nbounds.[4]Indeed, if SORNA\u2019s delegation is\nunconstitutional, then most of Government is\nunconstitutional\u2014dependent as Congress is on the need to give\ndiscretion to executive officials to implement its programs.\nConsider again this Court\u2019s long-time recognition: \u201cCongress simply\ncannot do its job absent an ability to delegate power under broad\ngeneral directives.\u201dMistretta, 488 U.\u00a0S., at 372; seesupra, at 5. Or as the dissent in that case agreed: \u201c[S]ome\njudgments .\u00a0.\u00a0. must be left to the officers executing\nthe law.\u201d 488 U.\u00a0S., at 415 (opinion of Scalia, J.); seeWhitman, 531 U.\u00a0S., at 475 (\u201c[A] certain degree of\ndiscretion[\u00a0] inheres in most executive\u201d action (internal\nquotation marks omitted)). Among the judgments often left to\nexecutive officials are ones involving feasibility. In fact,\nstandards of that kind are ubiquitous in the U.\u00a0S. Code. See,e.g.,12 U. S. C. \u00a71701z\u20132(a) (providing that the Secretary\nof Housing and Urban Development \u201cshall require, to the greatest\nextent feasible, the employment of new and improved technologies,\nmethods, and materials in housing construction[\u00a0] under [HUD]\nprograms\u201d); 47 U. S. C. \u00a7903(d)(1) (providing that \u201cthe Secretary\nof Commerce shall promote efficient and cost-effective use of the\nspectrum to the maximum extent feasible\u201d in \u201cassigning frequencies\nfor mobile radio services\u201d). In those delegations, Congress gives\nits delegee the flexibility to deal with real-world constraints in\ncarrying out his charge. So too in SORNA.It is wisdom and humility alike that this Court\nhas always upheld such \u201cnecessities of government.\u201dMistretta, 488 U.\u00a0S., at 416 (Scalia, J., dissenting)\n(internal quo- tation marks omitted); seeibid.(\u201cSince\nCongress is no less endowed with common sense than we are, and\nbetter equipped to inform itself of the \u2018necessities\u2019 of\ngovernment; and since the factors bearing upon those necessities\nare both multifarious and (in the nonpartisan sense) highly\npolitical . . . it is small wonder that we have almost never felt\nqualified to second-guess Congress regarding the permissible degree\nof policy judgment that can be left to those executing or applying\nthe law\u201d). We therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of\nAppeals.It is so ordered.Justice Kavanaugh took no part in the\nconsideration or decision of this case.Notes1As to that point, the\ndissent criticized the majority only for basing its view in part on\nlegislative history. 565 U.\u00a0S., at 448, n. (opinion of Scalia,\nJ.). The dissent found the majority\u2019s excursion into history \u201cquite\nsuperfluous\u201d given that the \u201ctext of the Act itself makes clear\nthat Congress sought\u201d to ensure the registration of all pre-Act\noffenders.Ibid.In reaching that conclusion, the dissent\nrelied on the Act\u2019s express statement of purpose and its \u201csex\noffender\u201d definition. Seeinfra, at 11\u201313.2Once again, the dissent\nagreed with the Court that \u00a720913(d) could not sensibly be read to\ngive the Attorney General any greater power. \u201c[I]t is simply\nimplausible,\u201d the dissent concluded, \u201cthat the Attorney General was\ngiven discretion to determine whether coverage of pre-Act offenders\n(one of the purposes of the Act) should exist.\u201d 565 U.\u00a0S., at\n450 (opinion of Scalia, J.). The dissent parted ways with the Court\nonly in interpreting \u00a720913(d) to provide the Attorney General with\neven less authority.3Gundy tries to dispute\nthat simple fact, but fails. He points to changes that Attorneys\nGeneral have made in guidelines to States about how to satisfy\nSORNA\u2019s funding conditions. See Brief for Petitioner 32\u201333. But\nthose state-directed rules are independent of the only thing at\nissue here: the application of registration requirements to pre-Act\noffenders. Those requirements have been constant since the Attorney\nGeneral\u2019s initial rule, as the guidelines themselves affirm. See 73\nFed. Reg. 38046 (2008); 76 Fed. Reg. 1639 (2011). Indeed, the\nguidelines to States are issued not under \u00a720913(d) at all, but\nunder a separate delegation in \u00a720912(b). See 73 Fed. Reg. 38030;\n76 Fed. Reg. 1631.4Even Gundy conceded at\noral argument that if the statute means what we have said, it\n\u201clikely would be constitutional.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 25. That is why\nall of his argument is devoted to showing that it means something\nelse.",
