HERNANDEZ, et\u00a0al., PETITIONERSv.JESUS MESA, Jr., et\u00a0al.on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the fifth circuit[June 26, 2017]Justice Thomas, dissenting.When we granted certiorari in this case, we\ndirected the parties to address, in addition to the questions\npresented by petitioners, \u201c[w]hether the claim in this case may be\nasserted underBivensv.Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics\nAgents, 403 U.\u00a0S. 388 (1971) .\u201d 580 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2016).\nI would answer that question, rather than remand for the Court of\nAppeals to do so. I continue to adhere to the view that\n\u201cBivensand its progeny\u201d should be limited \u201cto the precise\ncircumstances that they involved.\u201dZiglarv.Abbasi,ante, at 2 (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in\njudgment) (internal quotation marks omitted). This case arises in\ncircumstances that are meaningfully different from those at issue\ninBivensand its progeny. Most notably, this case involves\ncross-border conduct, and those cases did not. I would decline to\nextendBivensand would affirm the judgment of the Court of\nAppeals on that basis.",
