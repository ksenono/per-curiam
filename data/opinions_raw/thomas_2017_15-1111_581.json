The FHA prohibits \u201cdiscrimination\u201d against \u201cany person\u201d\nbecause of \u201crace, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status,\nor national origin\u201d with respect to the \u201csale or rental\u201d of \u201ca\ndwelling.\u201d 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73604; accord, \u00a73605(a); \u00a73606.\nMiami\u2019s complaints do not allege that any defendant discriminated\nagainst it within the meaning of the FHA. Neither is Miami\nattempting to bring a lawsuit on behalf of its residents against\nwhom petitioners allegedly discriminated. Rather, Miami\u2019s theory is\nthat, between 2004 and 2012, petitioners\u2019 allegedly discriminatory\nmortgage-lending practices led to defaulted loans, which led to\nforeclosures, which led to vacant houses, which led to decreased\nproperty values, which led to reduced property taxes and urban\nblight. See 800 F.\u00a03d 1262, 1268 (CA11 2015); 801 F. 3d 1258,\n1266 (CA11 2015). Miami seeks damages from the lenders for reduced\nproperty tax revenues and for the cost of increased municipal\nservices\u2014\u201cpolice, firefighters, building inspectors, debris\ncollectors, and others\u201d\u2014deployed to attend to the blighted areas.\n800 F.\u00a03d, at 1269; 801 F.\u00a03d, at 1263.The Court today holds that Congress intended to\nremedy those kinds of injuries when it enacted the FHA, but leaves\nopen the question whether Miami sufficiently alleged that the\ndiscriminatory lending practices caused its injuries. For the\nreasons explained below, I would hold that Miami\u2019s injuries fall\noutside the FHA\u2019s zone of interests. I would also hold that, in any\nevent, Miami\u2019s alleged injuries are too remote to satisfy the FHA\u2019s\nproximate-cause requirement.IA plaintiff seeking to bring suit under a\nfederal statute must show not only that he has standing under\nArticle III,ante, at 5, but also that his \u201ccomplaint\nfall[s] within the zone of interests protected by the law\u201d he\ninvokes,Lexmark Int\u2019l, Inc.v.Static Control\nComponents, Inc., 572 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at\n7) (internal quotation marks omitted). The zone-of-interests\nrequirement is \u201croot[ed]\u201d in the \u201ccommon-law rule\u201d providing that a\nplaintiff may \u201crecover under the law of negligence for injuries\ncaused by violation of a statute\u201d only if \u201cthe statute \u2018is\ninterpreted as designed to protect the class of persons in which\nthe plaintiff is included, against the risk of the type of harm\nwhich has in fact occurred as a result of its violation.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId., at ___, n.\u00a05 (slip op., at 11, n.\u00a05) (quoting\nW. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, & D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton\non Law of Torts \u00a736, pp. 229\u2013230 (5th ed. 1984)). We have \u201cmade\nclear\u201d that \u201cCongress is presumed to legislate against the\nbackground\u201d of that common-law rule.Lexmark, 572\nU.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 10) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). We thus apply it \u201cto all statutorily created causes of\naction .\u00a0.\u00a0. unless it isexpresslynegated.\u201dIbid. (emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted).\n\u201cWhether a plaintiff comes within the zone of interests is an issue\nthat requires us to determine, using traditional tools of statutory\ninterpretation, whether a legislatively conferred cause of action\nencompasses a particular plaintiff\u2019s claim.\u201dId., at ___\n(slip op., at 8) (internal quotation marks omitted).ANothing in the text of the FHA suggests that\nCongress intended to deviate from the zone-of-interests limitation.\nThe statute\u2019s private-enforcement mechanism provides that only an\n\u201caggrieved person\u201d may sue, \u00a73613(a)(1)(A), and the statute defines\n\u201caggrieved person\u201d to mean someone who \u201cclaims to have been injured\nby a discriminatory housing practice\u201d or who believes he \u201cwill be\ninjured by a discriminatory housing practice that is about to\noccur,\u201d \u00a7\u00a73602(i)(1), (2). That language does not hint\u2014much less\nexpressly provide\u2014that Congress sought to depart from the\ncommon-law rule.We have considered similar language in other\nstatutes and reached the same conclusion. InThompsonv.North American Stainless, LP, 562 U.\u00a0S. 170 (2011) ,\nfor example, we considered Title VII\u2019s private-enforcement\nprovision, which provides that \u201c\u00a0\u2018a person claiming to be\naggrieved\u2019\u00a0\u201d may file an employment discrimination charge with\nthe Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.Id., at 173\n(quoting \u00a72000e\u20135(b)). We unanimously concluded that Congress did\nnot depart from the zone-of-interests limitation in Title VII by\nusing that language.Id., at 175\u2013178. And inLexmark,\nwe interpreted a provision of the Lanham Act that permitted \u201cany\nperson who believes that he or she is likely to be damaged by a\ndefendant\u2019s false advertising\u201d to sue. 572 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 10) (internal quotation marks omitted). Even when faced\nwith the broader \u201cany person\u201d language, we expressly rejected the\nargument that the statute conferred a cause of action upon anyone\nclaiming an Article III injury in fact. We observed that it was\nunlikely that \u201cCongress meant to allow all factually injured\nplaintiffs to recover,\u201d and we concluded that the zone-of-interests\ntest was the \u201cappropriate tool for determining who may invoke the\ncause of action\u201d under the statute.Id.,at ___, ___ (slip\nop., at 10, 11) (internal quotation marks omitted).To be sure, some language in our older\nprecedents suggests that the FHA\u2019s zone of interests extends to the\nlimits of Article III. SeeTrafficantev.Metropolitan\nLife Ins. Co., 409 U.\u00a0S. 205, 209 (1972) ;Gladstone,\nRealtorsv.Village of Bellwood, 441 U.\u00a0S. 91, 109\n(1979) ;Havens Realty Corp.v.Coleman, 455\nU.\u00a0S. 363, 372 (1982) . But we have since described that\nlanguage as \u201cill-considered\u201d dictum leading to \u201cabsurd\nconsequences.\u201dThompson, 562 U.\u00a0S., at 176. And we have\nobserved that the \u201choldings of those cases are compatible with the\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018zone of interests\u2019 limitation\u201d described inThompson.Ibid.That limitation provides that a\nplaintiff may not sue when his \u201cinterests are so marginally related\nto or inconsistent with the purposes implicit in the statute that\nit cannot be assumed that Congress intended to permit the suit.\u201dId., at 178 (internal quotation marks omitted). It thus\n\u201cexclud[es] plaintiffs who might technically be injured in an\nArticle III sense but whose interests are unrelated to the\nstatutory prohibitions.\u201dIbid.BIn my view, Miami\u2019s asserted injuries are \u201cso\nmarginally related to or inconsistent with the purposes\u201d of the FHA\nthat they fall outside the zone of interests. Here, as in any other\ncase, the text of the FHA defines the zone of interests that the\nstatute protects. SeeLexmark,supra, at ___ (slip\nop., at 9). The FHA permits \u201c[a]n aggrieved person\u201d to sue,\n\u00a73613(a)(1)(A), if he \u201cclaims to have been injured by adiscriminatory housing practice\u201d or believes that he \u201cwill\nbe injured by adiscriminatory housing practicethat is\nabout to occur,\u201d \u00a7\u00a73602(i)(1), (2) (emphasis added). Specifically,\nthe FHA makes it unlawful to do any of the following on the basis\nof \u201crace, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or\nnational origin\u201d: \u201crefuse to sell or rent .\u00a0.\u00a0. a\ndwelling,\u201d \u00a73604(a); discriminate in the \u201cterms, conditions, or\nprivileges of sale or rental of a dwelling, or in the provision of\nservices or facilities in connection therewith,\u201d \u00a73604(b); \u201cmake,\nprint, or publish .\u00a0.\u00a0. any notice, statement, or\nadvertisement, with respect to the sale or rental of a dwelling\nthat indicates any preference, limitation, or discrimination,\u201d\n\u00a73604(c); \u201crepresent to any person .\u00a0.\u00a0. that any\ndwelling is not available for inspection, sale, or rental when such\ndwelling is in fact so available,\u201d \u00a73604(d); \u201cinduce any person to\nsell or rent any dwelling by representations regarding the entry or\nprospective entry into the neighborhood of a person or persons of\u201d\ncertain characteristics, \u00a73604(e); or discriminate in the provision\nof real estate or brokerage services, \u00a7\u00a73605, 3606. The\nquintessential \u201caggrieved person\u201d in cases involving violations of\nthe FHA is a prospective home buyer or lessee discriminated against\nduring the home-buying or leasing process. Our cases have also\nsuggested that the interests of a person who lives in a\nneighborhood or apartment complex that remains segregated (or that\nrisks becoming segregated) as a result of a discriminatory housing\npractice may be arguably within the outer limit of the interests\nthe FHA protects. SeeTrafficante,supra, at 211\n(concluding that one purpose of the FHA was to promote \u201ctruly\nintegrated and balanced living patterns\u201d (internal quotation marks\nomitted)).Miami\u2019s asserted injuries are not arguably\nrelated to the interests the statute protects. Miami asserts that\nit received \u201creduced property tax revenues,\u201d App. 233, 417, and\nthat it was forced to spend more money on \u201cmunicipal services that\nit provided and still must provide to remedy blight and unsafe and\ndangerous conditions,\u201did., at 417; see alsoante, at\n2. The city blames these expenditures on the falling property\nvalues and vacant homes that resulted from foreclosures. But\nnothing in the text of the FHA suggests that Congress was concerned\nabout decreased property values, foreclosures, and urban blight,\nmuch less about strains on municipal budgets that might follow.Miami\u2019s interests are markedly distinct from the\ninterests this Court confronted inTrafficante,Gladstone, andHavens. InTrafficante, one\nwhite and one black tenant of an apartment complex sued on the\nground that the complex discriminated against nonwhite rental\napplicants. 409 U.\u00a0S., at 206\u2013208. They argued that this\ndiscrimination deprived them of the social and economic benefits of\nliving in an integrated community.Id., at 208. InGladstone, residents in a village sued based on alleged\ndiscrimination in the home-buying process. 441 U.\u00a0S., at\n93\u201395. They contended that white home buyers were steered away from\na racially integrated neighborhood and toward an all-white\nneighborhood, whereas black home buyers were steered away from the\nall-white neighborhood and toward the integrated neighborhood.Id., at 95. The plaintiffs thus alleged that they were\n\u201cdenied their right to select housing without regard to race.\u201dIbid.(internal quotation marks omitted). The village also\nsued, alleging that the FHA violations were affecting its \u201cracial\ncomposition, replacing what is presently an integrated neighborhood\nwith a segregated one\u201d and that its budget was strained from\nresulting lost tax revenues.Id., at 110. Finally, inHavens, one white and one black plaintiff sued after having\nposed as \u201ctesters,\u201d for the purpose of \u201ccollecting evidence of\nunlawful steering practices.\u201d 455 U.\u00a0S., at 373. According to\ntheir complaint, the owner of an apartment complex had told the\nwhite plaintiff that apartments were available, but had told the\nblack plaintiff that apartments were not.Id., at 368. The\nCourt held that the white plaintiff couldnotsue, because\nhe had been provided truthful information, but that the black\nplaintiffcouldsue, because the FHA requires truthful\ninformation about housing without regard to race.Id., at\n374\u2013375. In all three of these cases, the plaintiffs claimed\ninjuries based on racial steering and segregation\u2014interests that,\nunder this Court\u2019s precedents, at least arguably fall within the\nzone of interests that the FHA protects.Miami\u2019s asserted injuries implicate none of\nthose interests. Miami does not assert that it was injured based on\nefforts by the lenders to steer certain residents into one\nneighborhood rather than another. Miami does not even assert that\nit was injured because its neighborhoods were segregated. Miami\ntherefore is not, as the majority describes, \u201csimilarly situated\u201d\nto the plaintiffs inTrafficante,Gladstone, andHavens.Ante,at 7. Rather, Miami asserts injuries\nallegedly resulting from foreclosed-upon and then vacant homes. The\nFHA\u2019s zone of interests is not so expansive as to include those\nkinds of injuries.CThe Court today reaches the opposite\nconclusion, resting entirely on the brief mention inGladstoneof the village\u2019s asserted injury of reduced tax\nrevenues, and on principles ofstare decisis. Seeante, at 9. I do not thinkGladstonecompels the\nconclusion the majority reaches. Unlike these cases,Gladstoneinvolved injuries to interests in \u201cracial balance\nand stability,\u201d 441 U.\u00a0S., at 111, which, our cases have\nsuggested, arguably fall within the zone of interests protected by\nthe FHA, seesupra, at 6. The fact that the village\nplaintiff asserted a budget-related injuryin addition toits racial-steering injury does not mean that a city allegingonlya budget-related injury is authorized to sue. A\nbudget-related injury might be necessary to establish a\nsufficiently concrete and particularized injury for purposes of\nArticle III, but it is not sufficient to satisfy the FHA\u2019s\nzone-of-interests limitation.Although the Court\u2019s reliance onGladstoneis misplaced, its opinion today is notable\nprimarily for what it does not say. First, the Court conspicuously\ndoes not reaffirm the broad language fromTrafficante,Gladstone, andHavenssuggesting that Congress\nintended to permit any person with Article III standing to sue\nunder the FHA. The Court of Appeals felt bound by that language,\nsee 800 F.\u00a03d, at 1277; 801 F.\u00a03d, at 1266, and we\ngranted review, despite the absence of a circuit conflict, to\ndecide whether the language survivedThompsonandLexmark, see Brief for Petitioner in No. 15\u20131111, p.\u00a0i\n(\u201cBy limiting suit to \u2018aggrieved person[s],\u2019 did Congress require\nthat an FHA plaintiff plead more than just Article III\ninjury-in-fact?\u201d); Brief for Petitioner in No. 15\u20131112, p.\u00a0i\n(\u201cWhether the term \u2018aggrieved\u2019 in the Fair Housing Act imposes a\nzone-of-interests requirement more stringent than the\ninjury-in-fact requirement of Article III\u201d). Today\u2019s opinion avoids\nthose questions presented and thus cannot be read as retreating\nfrom our more recent precedents on the zone-of-interests\nlimitation.Second, the Court does not reject the lenders\u2019\narguments about many other kinds of injuries that fall outside of\nthe FHA\u2019s zone of interests. We explained inThompsonthat\nan expansive reading of Title VII\u2019s zone of interests would allow a\nshareholder \u201cto sue a company for firing a valuable employee for\nracially discriminatory reasons, so long as he could show that the\nvalue of his stock decreased as a consequence.\u201d 562 U.\u00a0S., at\n177.Petitioners similarly argue that, if Miami can sue for\nlost tax revenues under the FHA, then \u201cplumbers, utility companies,\nor any other participant in the local economy could sue the Banks\nto recover business they lost when people had to give up their\nhomes and leave the neighborhood as a result of the Banks\u2019\ndiscriminatory lending practices.\u201dAnte, at 8 (citing\npetitioners\u2019 briefs). The Court today decides that it \u201cneed not\ndiscuss\u201d this argument becauseGladstoneandstare\ndecisiscompel the conclusion that Miami can sue.Ante,\nat 8. That conclusion is wrong, but at least it is narrow.\nAccordingly, it should not be read to authorize suits by local\nbusinesses alleging the same injuries that Miami alleges here.IIAlthough I disagree with its zone-of-interests\nholding, I agree with the Court\u2019s conclusions about proximate\ncause, as far as they go. The Court correctly holds that\n\u201cforeseeability alone is not sufficient to establish proximate\ncause under the FHA.\u201dAnte, at 10. Instead, the statute\nrequires \u201c\u00a0\u2018some direct relation between the injury asserted\nand the injurious conduct alleged.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAnte, at 11\n(quotingHolmesv.Securities Investor Protection\nCorporation, 503 U.\u00a0S. 258, 268 (1992) ).After articulating this test for proximate\ncause, the Court remands to the Court of Appeals because it\n\u201cdecline[s]\u201d to \u201cdraw the precise boundaries of proximate cause\nunder the FHA\u201d or to \u201cdetermine on which side of the line the\nCity\u2019s financial injuries fall.\u201dAnte, at 12. But these\ncases come to the Court on a motion to dismiss, and the Court of\nAppeals has no advantage over us in evaluating the complaint\u2019s\nproximate-cause theory. Moreover, the majority opinion leaves\nlittle doubt that neither Miami nor any similarly situated\nplaintiff can satisfy the rigorous standard for proximate cause\nthat the Court adopts and leaves to the Court of Appeals to apply.\nSeeante, at 11 (\u201cThe general tendency in these cases, in\nregard to damages at least, is not to go beyond the first step\u201d\n(internal quotation marks omitted)).Miami\u2019s own account of causation shows that the\nlink between the alleged FHA violation and its asserted injuries is\nexceedingly attenuated. According to Miami, the lenders\u2019 injurious\nconduct was \u201ctarget[ing] black and Latino customers in Miami for\npredatory loans.\u201d Brief for Respondent in No. 15\u20131111, p. 4\n(internal quotation marks omitted). And according to Miami, the\ninjuries asserted are its \u201closs of tax revenues\u201d and its\nexpenditure of \u201cadditional monies on municipal services to address\u201d\nthe consequences of urban blight.Id., at 6.As Miami describes it, the chain of causation\nbetween the injurious conduct and its asserted injuries proceeds as\nfollows: As a result of the lenders\u2019 discriminatory loan practices,\nborrowers from predominantly minority neighborhoods were likely to\ndefault on their home loans, leading to foreclosures.Id.,\nat 5\u20136. The foreclosures led to vacant houses.Id., at 6.\nThe vacant houses, in turn, led to decreased property values for\nthe surrounding homes.Ibid.Finally, those decreased\nproperty values resulted in homeowners paying lower property taxes\nto the city government.Ibid.Also, Miami explains, the\nforeclosed-upon, vacant homes eventually led to \u201cvagrancy, criminal\nactivity, and threats to public health and safety,\u201d which the city\nhad to address through the expenditures of municipal resources.Ibid.And all this occurred, according to Miami, between\n2004 and 2012. Seeibid.The Court of Appeals will not need\nto look far to discern other, independent events that might well\nhave caused the injuries Miami alleges in these cases.In light of this attenuated chain of causation,\nMiami\u2019s asserted injuries are too remote from the injurious conduct\nit has alleged. SeeAssociated Gen. Contractors of Cal.,\nInc.v.Carpenters, 459 U.\u00a0S. 519 , n.\u00a025\n(1983). Indeed, any other conclusion would lead to disquieting\nconsequences. Under Miami\u2019s own theory of causation, its injuries\nare one step further removed from the allegedly discriminatory\nlending practices than the injuries suffered by the neighboring\nhomeowners whose houses declined in value. No one suggests that\nthose homeowners could sue under the FHA, and I think it is clear\nthat they cannot. Accordingly, I would hold that Miami has failed\nto sufficiently plead proximate cause under the FHA.IIIFor the foregoing reasons, I would reverse the\nCourt of Appeals.",
