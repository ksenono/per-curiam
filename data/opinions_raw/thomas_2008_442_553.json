S. ____ (2008)SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESNO. 06-1431CBOCS WEST, INC., PETITIONERv.HEDRICK G.\nHUMPHRIESon writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the seventh circuit[May 27, 2008]Justice Thomas, with whom Justice\nScalia joins, dissenting.The Court holds that the private\nright of action it has implied under Rev. Stat. \u00a71977, 42 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a71981, encompasses claims of retaliation. Because the\nCourt\u2019s holding has no basis in the text of \u00a71981 and is not\njustified by principles ofstare decisis, I respectfully\ndissent.IIt is unexceptional in our case\nlaw that \u201c\u00a0\u2018[s]tatutory construction must begin with the\nlanguage employed by Congress and the assumption that the ordinary\nmeaning of that language accurately expresses the legislative\npurpose.\u2019\u00a0\u201dEngine Mfrs. Assn.v.South Coast Air\nQuality Management Dist.,541 U. S. 246, 252\n(2004) (quotingPark \u2019N Fly, Inc.v.Dollar Park &\nFly, Inc.,469\nU. S. 189, 194 (1985)). Today, that rule is honored in the\nbreach: The Court\u2019s analysis of the statutory text does not appear\nuntil Part III of its opinion, and then only as a potential reason\nto depart from the interpretation the Court has already concluded,\non other grounds, must \u201ccarry the day.\u201dAnte, at 9. Unlike\nthe Court, I think it best to begin, as we usually do, with the\ntext of the statute. Section 1981(a) provides:\u201cAll persons within the\njurisdiction of the United States shall have the same right in\nevery State and Territory to make and enforce contracts, to sue, be\nparties, give evidence, and to the full and equal benefit of all\nlaws and proceedings for the security of persons and property as is\nenjoyed by white citizens, and shall be subject to like punishment,\npains, penalties, taxes, licenses, and exactions of every kind, and\nto no other.\u201dSection 1981(a) thus guarantees\n\u201c[a]ll persons \u2026 the same right \u2026 to make and enforce contracts \u2026\nas is enjoyed by white citizens.\u201d It is difficult to see where one\nfinds a cause of action for retaliation in this language. On its\nface, \u00a71981(a) is a straightforward ban on racial discrimination in\nthe making and enforcement of contracts. Not surprisingly, that is\nhow the Court has always construed it. See,e.g.,Domino\u2019s Pizza, Inc.v.McDonald,546 U. S. 470, 476\n(2006) (\u201cSection 1981 offers relief when racial discrimination\nblocks the creation of a contractual relationship, as well as when\nracial discrimination impairs an existing contractual\nrelationship\u201d);Pattersonv.McLean Credit Union,491 U. S. 164,\n171 (1989) (\u201c[Section] 1981 \u2018prohibits racial discrimination in the\nmaking and enforcement of private contracts\u2019\u00a0\u201d (quotingRunyonv.McCrary,427 U. S. 160, 168 (1976)));Johnsonv.Railway Express Agency, Inc.,421 U. S. 454, 459\n(1975) (Section 1981 \u201con its face relates primarily to racial\ndiscrimination in the making and enforcement of contracts\u201d).Respondent nonetheless contends that \u201c[t]he\nterms of section 1981 are significantly different, and broader,\nthan a simple prohibition against discrimination.\u201d Brief for\nRespondent 15. It is true that \u00a71981(a), which was enacted shortly\nafter the Civil War, does not use the modern statutory formulation\nprohibiting \u201cdiscrimination on the basis of race.\u201d But that is the\nclear import of its terms. Contrary to respondent\u2019s contention,\nnothing in \u00a71981 evinces a \u201cconcer[n] with protecting individuals\n\u2018based on what they do,\u2019\u00a0\u201d as opposed to \u201c\u00a0\u2018prevent[ing]\ninjury to individuals based on who they are.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIbid.\n(quotingBurlington N.\u00a0&\u00a0S.\u00a0F.\u00a0R.\nCo.v.White,548 U. S. 53, 63 (2006)).\nNor does \u00a71981 \u201caffirmatively guarante[e]\u201d freestanding \u201crights to\nengage in particular conduct.\u201d Brief for Respondent 16. Rather,\n\u00a71981 is anequal-rightsprovision. SeeGeorgiav.Rachel,384 U. S. 780, 791\n(1966) (\u201cCongress intended to protect a limited category of rights,\nspecifically defined in terms of racial equality\u201d). The statute\nassumes that \u201cwhite citizens\u201d enjoy certain rights and requires\nthat those rights be extended equally to \u201c[a]ll persons,\u201d\nregardless of their race. That is to say, it prohibits\ndiscrimination based on race.[Footnote 1]Retaliation is not discrimination based on\nrace. When an individual is subjected to reprisal because he has\ncomplained about racial discrimination, the injury he suffers is\nnot on account of hisrace;rather, it is the result of\nhisconduct. The Court recognized this commonsense\ndistinction just two years ago inBurlingtonwhen it\nexplained that Title VII\u2019s antidiscrimination provision \u201cseeks to\nprevent injury to individuals based on who they are,i.e.,\ntheir status,\u201d whereas its \u201cantiretaliation provision seeks to\nprevent harm to individuals based on what they do,i.e.,\ntheir conduct.\u201d 548 U. S., at 63. This distinction is sound, and it\nreflects the fact that a claim of retaliation is both logically and\nfactually distinct from a claim of discrimination\u2014logically because\nretaliation based on conduct and discrimination based on status are\nmutually exclusive categories, and factually because a claim of\nretaliation does not depend on proof that any status-based\ndiscrimination actually occurred. Consider, for example, an\nemployer who fires any employee who complains of race\ndiscrimination, regardless of the employee\u2019s race. Such an employer\nis undoubtedly guilty of retaliation, but he has not discriminated\non the basis of anyone\u2019s race. Because the employer treats all\nemployees\u2014black and white\u2014the same, he does not deny any employee\n\u201cthe same right \u2026 to make and enforce contracts \u2026 as is enjoyed by\nwhite citizens.\u201d[Footnote\n2]The Court apparently believes that the\nstatus/conduct distinction is not relevant here because this case,\nunlikeBurlington, does not require us to determine\nwhether \u00a71981\u2019s supposed prohibition on retaliation \u201csweep[s] more\nbroadly\u201d than its antidiscrimination prohibition.Ante, at\n13. That is nonsense. Although, as the Court notes, we used the\nstatus/conduct distinction inBurlingtonto explain why\nTitle VII\u2019s antiretaliation provision must sweep more broadly than\nits antidiscrimination provision in order to achieve its purpose,\n548 U. S., at 63\u201364, it does not follow that the distinction\nbetween status and conduct is irrelevant here. To the contrary,Burlingtonunderscores the fact that status-based\ndiscrimination and conduct-based retaliation are distinct harms\nthat call for tailored legislative treatment. That is why Congress,\nin Title VII and a host of other statutes, has enacted separate\nprovisions prohibiting discrimination and retaliation. See Brief\nfor Petitioner 17\u201318 (citing statutes); see alsoante, at\n10\u201311 (same). Construing a general ban on discrimination such as\nthat contained in \u00a71981 to cover retaliation would render these\nseparate antiretaliation provisions superfluous, contrary to the\nnormal rules of statutory interpretation.Of course, this is not the first time I have\nmade these points. Three Terms ago inJacksonv.Birmingham Bd. of Ed.,544 U. S. 167(2005),\nthe Court held that Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972,\n20 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71681et seq., which prohibits recipients\nof federal education funding from discriminating \u201con the basis of\nsex,\u201d \u00a71681(a), affords an implied cause of action for retaliation\nagainst those who complain of sex discrimination. In so doing, the\nCourt disregarded the fundamental distinction between status-based\ndiscrimination and conduct-based retaliation, asserting that\nretaliation against those who complain of sex discrimination \u201cis\ndiscrimination \u2018on the basis of sex\u2019 because it is an intentional\nresponse to the nature of the complaint: an allegation of sex\ndiscrimination.\u201d 544 U. S., at 174. But as I explained in my\ndissenting opinion inJackson, \u201cthe sex-based topic of the\ncomplaint cannot overcome the fact that the retaliation is not\nbased on anyone\u2019s sex, much less the complainer\u2019s sex.\u201dId., at 188.Likewise here, the race-based topic of the\ncomplaint cannot overcome the fact that the retaliation is not\nbased on anyone\u2019s race. To hold otherwise would be to ignore the\nfact that \u201cprotection from retaliation is separate from direct\nprotection of the primary right [against discrimination] and serves\nas a prophylactic measure to guard the primary right.\u201dId., at 189; see alsoBurlington,supra,\nat 63 (explaining that Title VII\u2019s \u201cantidiscrimination provision\nseeks a workplace where individuals are not discriminated against\nbecause of their racial, ethnic, religious, or gender-based\nstatus,\u201d whereas its \u201cantiretaliation provision seeks to secure\nthat primary objective by preventing an employer from interfering\n(through retaliation) with an employee\u2019s efforts to secure or\nadvance enforcement of the Act\u2019s basic guarantees\u201d). In other\nwords, \u201c[t]o describe retaliation as discrimination on the basis of\n[race] is to conflate the enforcement mechanism with the right\nitself, something for which the statute\u2019s text provides no\nwarrant.\u201dJackson,supra, at 189 (Thomas, J.,\ndissenting).Notably, the Court does not repeatJackson\u2019s textual analysis in this case, perhaps because\nno amount of repetition could make it any more plausible today than\nit was three years ago. Instead, the Court acknowledges that \u201cthe\nstatute\u2019s language does not expressly refer to the claim of an\nindividual (black or white) who suffers retaliation.\u201dAnte, at 9. The Court concludes, however, that the\nstatute\u2019s failure expressly to provide a cause of action for\nretaliation \u201cis not sufficient to carry the day,\u201dibid.,\ndespite our usual rule that \u201caffirmative evidence of congressional\nintent must be provided for an implied remedy \u2026 for without such\nintent the essential predicate for implication of a private remedy\nsimply does not exist,\u00a0\u201dAlexanderv.Sandoval,532 U. S. 275, 293, n. 8\n(2001) (internal quotation marks and emphasis deleted); see alsoid., at 286\u2013287 (emphasizing that, absent evidence of\nCongress\u2019 intent to create a cause of action, the \u201ccause of action\ndoes not exist and courts may not create one, no matter how\ndesirable that might be as a policy matter, or how compatible with\nthe statute\u201d).Section 1981\u2019s silence regarding retaliation\nis not dispositive, the Court says, because \u201cit is too late in the\nday\u201d to resort to \u201ca linguistic argument\u201d that was supposedly\nrejected inSullivanv.Little Hunting Park,\nInc.,396 U. S.\n229(1969).Ante, at 10. As I explain below, the\nCourt\u2019s reliance onSullivanis entirely misplaced. But it\nalso bears emphasis that the Court does not even purport to\nidentify any basis in the statutory text for the \u201cwell-embedded\ninterpretation of \u00a71981,\u201dante,at 8\u20139, it adopts for the\nfirst time today. Unlike the Court, I find the statute\u2019s text\ndispositive. Because \u00a71981 by its terms prohibits only\ndiscrimination based on race, and because retaliation is not\ndiscrimination based on race, \u00a71981 does not provide an implied\ncause of action for retaliation.IIUnable to justify its holding as\na matter of statutory interpretation, the Court today retreats\nbehind the figleaf of ersatzstare decisis. The Court\u2019s\ninvocation ofstare decisisappears to rest on three\nconsiderations: (1)Sullivan\u2019s purported recognition of a\ncause of action for retaliation under \u00a71982; (2)Jackson\u2019s\n(re)interpretation ofSullivan;and (3) the Courts of\nAppeals\u2019 view that \u00a71981 provides a cause of action for\nretaliation. None of these considerations, separately or together,\njustifies implying a cause of action that Congress did not include\nin the statute. And none can conceal the irony in the Court\u2019s novel\nuse ofstare decisisto decide a question of first\nimpression.I turn first toSullivan, as it bears most of the weight in the Court\u2019s\nanalysis. As I explained in my dissent inJackson,Sullivandid not \u201chol[d] that a general prohibition\nagainst discrimination permitted a claim of retaliation,\u201d but\nrather \u201cthat a white lessor had standing to assert the right of a\nblack lessee to be free from racial discrimination.\u201d 544 U. S., at\n194. Thus, \u201c[t]o make out his third-party claim on behalf of the\nblack lessee, the white lessor would necessarily be required to\ndemonstrate that the defendant had discriminated against the black\nlessee on the basis of race.\u201dIbid. Here, by contrast,\nrespondent \u201cneed not show that the [race] discrimination forming\nthe basis of his complaints actually occurred.\u201dIbid.\nAccordingly, as it did inJackson, the Court \u201ccreates an\nentirely new cause of action for a secondary rights holder, beyond\nthe claim of the original rights holder, and well beyondSullivan.\u201dId., at 194\u2013195.Having reexaminedSullivan, I remain\nconvinced that it was a third-party standing case. Sullivan did not\nargue that his expulsion from the corporation\u2014as opposed to the\ncorporation\u2019s refusal to approve the assignment\u2014violated \u00a71982.\nInstead, he argued that his expulsion was \u201ccontrary to public\npolicy\u201d because it was the \u201cdirect result of his having dealt with\nFreeman, as the statute requires, on a non-discriminatory basis.\u201d\nBrief for Petitioners inSullivanv.Little Hunting\nPark, Inc., O.\u00a0T. 1969, No. 33, p.\u00a032. Sullivan\nfurther contended not that his own rights under \u00a71982 had been\nviolated, but that he \u201cha[d] standing to rely on the rights of the\nNegro, Freeman,\u201d since he was best situated to vindicate those\nrights.[Footnote 3]Id., at 33; see also Pet. for Cert. inSullivanv.Little Hunting Park, Inc., O.\u00a0T. 1969, No. 33,\np.\u00a017, n.\u00a013 (\u201cAlthough the statute declares the rights\nof Negroes not to be discriminated against, Sullivan, a Caucasian,\nhas standing to rely on the invasion of the rights of others, since\nhe is the only effective adversary capable of vindicating them in\nlitigation arising from his expulsion\u201d (internal quotation marks\nomitted)). Similarly, the United States, appearing asamicus\ncuriaein support of Sullivan, argued that because \u201cthe\nprivate action involved in refusing to honor the assignment was\nitself illegal,\u201d \u201crelief should be available to all persons injured\nby it, or as a consequence of their efforts to resist it.\u201d Brief\nfor United States, O.\u00a0T. 1969, No. 33, p.\u00a034.Thus, both Sullivan and the United States\nargued that Sullivan had standing to seek relief for injuries he\nsuffered as a result of the corporation\u2019s violation of Freeman\u2019s\nrights\u2014not that Sullivan\u2019s own rights under \u00a71982 were violated.\nAnd that is the best interpretation of what the Court subsequently\nheld. Tracking the parties\u2019 arguments, the Court first concluded\nthat that the corporation\u2019s \u201crefus[al] to approve the assignment of\nthe membership share \u2026 was clearly an interference with Freeman\u2019s\nright to \u2018lease\u2019\u00a0\u201d under \u00a71982. 396 U. S., at 237. Only then\ndid it conclude\u2014based onBarrowsv.Jackson,346 U. S. 249(1953), a third-party standing case in which another white litigant\nwas permitted to \u201crely on the invasion of the rights of others,\u201did., at 255\u2014that Sullivan \u201cha[d] standing to maintain this\naction.\u201dSullivan, 396 U. S., at 237. The word\n\u201cretaliation\u201d does not appear in the Court\u2019s opinion. Nor is there\nany suggestion that Sullivan would have had \u201cstanding\u201d absent the\nviolation of Freeman\u2019s rights.Of course,Sullivanis not a model of\nclarity, and Justice Harlan, writing in dissent, was correct to\ncriticize the \u201cundiscriminating manner\u201d in which the Court dealt\nwith Sullivan\u2019s claims.Id.,at 251. Sullivan had sought\nrelief both for the corporation\u2019s refusal to approve the assignment\nand for his expulsion.Id., at 253. But in stating that\nSullivan had standing to maintain \u201cthis action,\u201did., at\n237, the Court did not specify what relief Sullivan was entitled to\npursue on remand. Lamenting the Court\u2019s \u201cfailure to provide any\nguidance as to the legal standards that should govern Sullivan\u2019s\nright to recovery on remand,\u201did., at 252 (dissenting\nopinion), Justice Harlan provided an instructive summary of the\nambiguities in the Court\u2019s opinion:\u201cOne can imagine a variety of\nstandards, each based on different legal conclusions as to the\n\u2018rights\u2019 and \u2018duties\u2019 created by \u00a71982, and each having very\ndifferent remedial consequences. For example, does \u00a71982 give\nSullivan a right to relief only for injuries resulting from Little\nHunting Park\u2019s interference withhisstatutory duty to\nFreeman under \u00a71982? If so, what is Sullivan\u2019s duty to Freeman\nunder \u00a71982? Unless \u00a71982 is read to impose a duty on Sullivan toprotestFreeman\u2019s exclusion, he would be entitled to\nreinstatement under this standard only if the Board had expelled\nhim for the simple act of assigning his share to Freeman.\u201cAs an alternative, Sullivan might be thought\nto be entitled to relief from those injuries that flowed from the\nBoard\u2019s violation ofits\u2018duty\u2019 to Freeman under \u00a71982.\nSuch a standard might suggest that Sullivan is entitled to damages\nthat resulted from Little Hunting Park\u2019s initial refusal to accept\nthe assignment to Freeman but again not to reinstatement. Or does\nthe Court think that \u00a71982 gives Sullivan a right to relief from\ninjuries that result from his \u2018legitimate\u2019 protest aimed at\nconvincing the Board to accept Freeman?\u201dId., at\n254\u2013255.It is noteworthy that of the\nthree possible standards Justice Harlan outlined, the first two\nclearly depend on a showing that Freeman\u2019s \u00a71982 rights were\nviolated. Only the third\u2014\u201cOr does the Court think that \u00a71982 gives\nSullivan a right to relief from injuries that result from his\n\u2018legitimate\u2019 protest\u201d\u2014resembles a traditional retaliation claim\nand, in context, even it is probably best read to presuppose that\nSullivan was protesting an actual violation of Freeman\u2019s rights.Id.,at 255. Which, if any, of these standards the Court\nhad in mind is anybody\u2019s guess. It did not say.I thus adhere to my view thatSullivanis best read as a third-party standing case. That\nis how the parties argued the case, and that is the most natural\nreading of the Court\u2019s opinion. But even ifSullivancould\nfairly be read as having inferred a freestanding cause of action\nfor retaliation\u2014which I doubt it can, at least not without\nsuperimposing an anachronistic outlook on a Court that was not as\nfamiliar with retaliation claims as we are today\u2014the Court\u2019s\none-paragraph discussion of the issue was, at best, both cursory\nand ambiguous. This is hardly the stuff of whichstare\ndecisisis made.Steadfastly refusing to acknowledge any\nambiguity, the Court asserts that it is \u201cnot surprising that\nfollowingSullivan, federal appeals courts concluded, on\nthe basis ofSullivanor its reasoning, that \u00a71981\nencompassed retaliation claims.\u201dAnte, at 5. But givenSullivan\u2019s use of the word \u201cstanding\u201d and its reliance on\na third-party standing case, what is unsurprising is that each of\nthe cases the Court cites either characterized the issue as one of\nstanding,Winstonv.Lear-Siegler, Inc., 558\nF.\u00a02d 1266, 1270 (CA6 1977) (characterizing the issue as\n\u201cwhether or not the white plaintiff in this action has standing to\nsue his former employer under 42 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71981 for\ndischarging him in alleged retaliation for plaintiff\u2019s protesting\nthe alleged discriminatory firing of a black co-worker\u201d), or\nrecognized that it was taking a step beyondSullivanin\ninferring a cause of action for retaliation,Choudhuryv.Polytechnic Inst. of N.\u00a0Y., 735 F.\u00a02d 38, 42\n(CA2 1984) (stating that the Second Circuit \u201cha[d] never decided\nwhether \u00a71981 creates a cause of action for retaliation,\u201d even\nthough it had previously held, based onSullivan, \u201cthat a\nwhite person who claimed to have suffered reprisals as a result of\nhis efforts to vindicate the rights of non-whites had standing to\nsue under \u00a71981\u201d);Goffv.Continental Oil Co.,\n678 F.\u00a02d 593, 598, n.\u00a07 (CA5 1982) (recognizing thatSullivanand a previous Fifth Circuit decision relying onSullivanwere \u201cessentially standing cases holding that\nwhite people can assert civil rights claims when they are harmed by\nsomeone\u2019s discrimination against blacks,\u201d which is distinct from\nholding that \u201ca particular type of conduct\u2014retaliation for the\nfiling of a \u00a71981 law suit\u2014is actionable in the first place\u201d).Moreover, even ifSullivanhad\nsquarely and unambiguously held that \u00a71982 provides an implied\ncause of action for retaliation, it would have been wrong to do so\nbecause \u00a71982, like \u00a71981, prohibits only discrimination based on\nrace, and retaliation is not discrimination based on race.[Footnote 4] The question, then, would\nbe whether to extendSullivan\u2019s erroneous interpretation\nof \u00a71982 to \u00a71981. The Court treats this as a foregone conclusion\nbecause \u201cour precedents have long construed \u00a7\u00a71981 and 1982\nsimilarly.\u201dAnte, at 4. But erroneous precedents need not\nbe extended to their logical end, even when dealing with related\nprovisions that normally would be interpreted in lockstep.[Footnote 5] Otherwise,stare\ndecisis, designed to be a principle of stability and repose,\nwould become a vehicle of change whereby an error in one area\nmetastasizes into others, thereby distorting the law. Two wrongs do\nnot make a right, and an aesthetic preference for symmetry should\nnot prevent us from recognizing the true meaning of an Act of\nCongress.The Court\u2019s remaining reasons for invokingstare decisisrequire little discussion. First, the Court\nrelies on the fact thatJacksoninterpretedSullivanas having recognized a cause of action for\nretaliation under \u00a71982. Seeante, at 3, 9\u201310. That is\ntrue but irrelevant. It was only through loose language and\ncreative use of brackets thatJacksonwas able to assert\nthatSullivan\u201cupheld Sullivan\u2019s cause of action under 42\nU. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71982 for \u2018[retaliation] for the advocacy of [the\nblack person\u2019s] cause.\u2019\u00a0\u201d 544 U. S., at 176 (quotingSullivan, 396 U. S., at 237; brackets in original). Of\ncourse,Sullivandid not use the word \u201cretaliation,\u201d did\nnot say anything about a \u201ccause of action,\u201d and did not state that\nSullivan had rights under \u00a71982. It most certainly did not\n\u201cinterpre[t] a general prohibition on racial discrimination to\ncover retaliation against those who advocate the rights of groups\nprotected by that prohibition.\u201dJackson, 544 U. S., at\n176.Jackson\u2019s assertion thatSullivan\u201cplainly\nheld that the white owner could maintain hisownprivate\ncause of action under \u00a71982,\u201did., at 176, n. 1, misses\nthe point entirely. WhileSullivanheld that \u201cthe white\nowner\u201d had standing to maintain his ownsuit, it said\nnothing to suggest that he could sue to vindicate his ownrightto be free from retaliation under \u00a71982. Rather, as\nI have explained, Sullivan\u2019s \u201cstanding\u201d was derivative of the\nviolation of Freeman\u2019s rights. In short,Jackson\u2019s\ncharacterization ofSullivanwas erroneous, and I am aware\nof no principle ofstare decisisthat requires us to give\ndecisive weight to a precedent\u2019s erroneous characterization of\nanother precedent\u2014particularly where, as here, the cases involved\ndifferent statutes, neither of which was the statute at issue in\nthe case at bar.Second, the Court appears to give weight to\nthe fact that, since Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1991,\n\u00a7101, 105 Stat. 1071, \u201cthe lower courts have uniformly interpreted\n\u00a71981 as encompassing retaliation actions.\u201dAnte, at 8.\nThis rationale fares no better than the others. The Court has never\nsuggested that rejection of a view uniformly held by the courts of\nappeals violates some principle ofstare decisis. To the\ncontrary, we have not hesitated to take a different view if\nconvinced the lower courts were wrong. Indeed, it has become\nsomething of a dissenter\u2019s tactic to point out that the Court has\ndecided a question differently than every court of appeals to have\nconsidered it. See,e.g.,McConnellv.Federal Election Comm\u2019n,540 U. S. 93, 278,\nn.\u00a011 (2003) (Thomas,J., concurring in part,\nconcurring in result in part, concurring in judgment in part, and\ndissenting in part);Buckhannon Board & Care Home,\nInc.v.West Virginia Dept. of Health and Human\nResources,532\nU. S. 598, 643 (2001) (Ginsburg, J., dissenting);Sandoval, 532 U. S., at 294 (Stevens, J., dissenting);Jonesv.United States,526 U. S. 227, 254\n(1999) (Kennedy, J., dissenting);McNallyv.United\nStates,483 U.\nS. 350, 365 (1987) (Stevens, J., dissenting). The Court does\nnot explain what makes this particular line of lower court\nauthority any more sacrosanct than those we have rejected in the\npast.Of course, lower court\ndecisions may be persuasive, and when the Court rejects the\nunanimous position of the courts of appeals, it is fair to point\nout that fact. But the point has traction only to the extent it\ntends to show that the Court\u2019s reasoning is flawed on the merits,\nas demonstrated by the number of judges who have reached the\nopposite conclusion. See,e.g.,Buckhannon,supra, at 643\u2013644 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting) (\u201cWhen this\nCourt rejects the considered judgment prevailing in the Circuits,\nrespect for our colleagues demands a cogent explanation\u201d). Unlike\ndecisions of this Court, decisions of the courts of appeals, even\nwhen unanimous, do not carrystare decisisweight, nor do\nthey relieve us of our obligation independently to decide the\nmerits of the question presented. That is why, when we have\naffirmed a view unanimously held by the courts of appeals, we have\ndone so (at least until today) not because we gave precedential\nweight to the lower courts\u2019 decisions, but because we agreed with\ntheir resolution of the question on the merits. See,e.g.,Gonzalezv.Crosby,545 U. S. 524, 531\n(2005) (\u201cVirtually every Court of Appeals to consider the question\nhas held that such a pleading \u2026 is in substance a successive habeas\npetition \u2026\u00a0. We think those holdings are correct\u201d);Lampf,\nPleva, Lipkind, Prupis & Petigrowv.Gilbertson,501 U. S. 350,\n362 (1991) (\u201cThus, we agree with every Court of Appeals that has\nbeen called upon to apply a federal statute of limitations to a\n\u00a710(b) claim\u201d).IIIAs inJackson, \u201c[t]he question before us is only whether [\u00a71981]\nprohibits retaliation, not whether prohibiting it is good policy.\u201d\n544 U. S., at 195 (Thomas, J., dissenting). \u201cBy crafting its own\nadditional enforcement mechanism, the majority returns this Court\nto the days in which it created remedies out of whole cloth to\neffectuate its vision of congressional purpose.\u201dIbid.\nThat the Court does so under the guise ofstare decisisdoes not make its decision any more justifiable. Because the text\nof \u00a71981 provides no basis for implying a private right of action\nfor retaliation, and because no decision of this Court holds to the\ncontrary, I would reverse the judgment below.Footnote\n1The United States, appearing\nasamicus curiaein support of respondent, contends that\n\u00a71981 prohibits not only racial discrimination, but also any other\nkind of \u201cdiscrimination\u201d that \u201cimpair[s]\u201d the rights guaranteed by\n\u00a71981(a). Brief for United States 17. In support of this argument,\nthe United States points to \u00a71981(c), which provides that \u201c[t]he\nrights protected by this section are protected against impairment\nby nongovernmental discrimination and impairment under color of\nState law.\u201d Thus, the argument goes, retaliation is prohibited\nbecause it is discrimination (differential treatment for those who\ncomplain) and it impairs the right granted in \u00a71981(a) to be free\nfrom racial discrimination in the making and enforcement of\ncontracts (by penalizing assertion of that right).Although I commend the United\nStates for at least attempting to ground its position in the\nstatutory text, its argument is unconvincing. Section 1981(c)\nsimply codifies the Court\u2019s holding inRunyonv.McCrary,427 U. S. 160(1976), that \u00a71981\napplies to private, as well as governmental, discrimination.\nNothing in \u00a71981(c) indicates that Congress otherwise intended to\nexpand the scope of \u00a71981. To the contrary, \u00a71981(c) refers to\n\u201c[t]he rights protected by this section,\u201di.e., the rights\nenumerated in \u00a71981(a) to make and enforce contracts on the same\nterms as white citizens. Moreover, the word \u201cdiscrimination\u201d in\n\u00a71981(c) does not refer to \u201call discrimination,\u201d as the United\nStates would have it. See Brief for United States asAmicus\nCuriae16, n.\u00a04. Rather, it refers back to the type of\ndiscrimination prohibited by \u00a71981(a),i.e.,\ndiscrimination based on race. Thus, \u00a71981 is violated only when\nracial discrimination impairs the right to make and enforce\ncontracts.Footnote\n2Of course, if an employer had\nadifferentretaliation policy for blacks and\nwhites\u2014firing black employees who complain of race discrimination\nbut not firing similarly situated white employees\u2014a black employee\nwho was fired for complaining of race discrimination would have a\npromising \u00a71981 claim. But his claim would not sound in\nretaliation; rather, it would be a straightforward claim of racial\ndiscrimination. In his briefs before this Court, respondent\nattempts to shoehorn his claim into this category, asserting that\npetitioner \u201cretaliated against [him] because he was a black worker\nwho exercised his right\u201d to lodge a grievance under petitioner\u2019s\nopen-door policy. Brief for Respondent 27; see alsoid.,\nat 33 (\u201c[S]ection 1981 forbids an employer from having one\ndismissal policy for blacks who complain about race discrimination,\nand another for whites who complain about such discrimination\u201d).\nBut respondent cites no record evidence to support his assertion\nthat petitioner treated him differently than it would have treated\na similarly situated white complainant. And while the Court of\nAppeals found that respondent had established a prima facie case of\nretaliation, 474 F.\u00a03d 387, 406\u2013407 (CA7 2007), it did not\nidentify any evidence that would permit a jury to conclude that the\nalleged retaliation was race based. Indeed, the Court of Appeals\nheld that respondent had \u201cwaived \u2026 his discrimination claim by\ndevoting only a skeletal argument [to it] in response to\n[petitioner\u2019s] motion for summary judgment.\u201dId., at\n407.Footnote\n3In contrast to his argument\nbased on \u00a71982, which he consistently tied to the violation of\nFreeman\u2019s rights, Sullivan also argued that hisownFirst\nAmendment rights were violated:\u201cSince Sullivan\u2019s expulsion was\nin retaliation for his having obeyed the dictate of the law the\nexpulsion was against public policy, and he should be reinstated.\nFor the law to sanction punishment of a person such as Sullivan for\nrefusing to discriminate against Negroes would be to render\nnugatorythe rights guaranteedto Negroesby 42\nU. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a71981, 1982 \u2026\u00a0. Furthermore, by giving sanction\nto Sullivan\u2019s expulsion, the state court deprived Sullivan ofhisrights, guaranteed by the First Amendment to\ncriticize the conduct of the association\u2019s directors.\u201d Brief for\nPetitioners, O.\u00a0T. 1969, No. 33, p. 14 (emphasis\nadded).Footnote\n4The majority claims thatSullivan\u201cdid not embrace\u201d this \u201clinguistic argument.\u201dAnte, at 10. That is because the argument was not before\nthe Court. The corporation did not argue that \u00a71982\u2019s text could\nnot reasonably be construed to create a cause of action for\nretaliation; nor did Justice Harlan in dissent. No one made this\nargument because that was not how the issue was framed, either by\nSullivan or by the Court. The majority suggests that the argument\nwas \u201capparent at the time the Court decidedSullivan.\u201dIbid. But the only evidence it cites is Justice Harlan\u2019s\nobservation that the Court\u2019s holding inJonesv.Alfred H. Mayer Co.,392 U. S. 409(1968),\nthat \u00a71982 prohibits private as well as governmental discrimination\nwas \u201cin no way required by [\u00a71982\u2019s] language.\u201dSullivan,\n396 U. S., at 241. I fail to see how that observation\u2014or Justice\nHarlan\u2019s further observation that the Court inSullivanhad gone \u201cyet beyondJones,\u201dibid.\u2014shows that the\nCourt considered and rejected the entirely different argument that\n\u00a71982\u2019s text does not provide a cause of action for\nretaliation.Footnote\n5For example, we have refused\nto extend the holding ofJ.\u00a0I. Case Co.v.Borak,377\nU. S. 426(1964), which inferred a private right of action for\nviolations of \u00a714(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, to\nother sections of the Act.Borakapplied the\nunderstanding\u2014later abandoned inCortv.Ash,422 U. S. 66, 78\n(1975)\u2014that \u201cit is the duty of the courts to be alert to provide\nsuch remedies as are necessary to make effective the congressional\npurpose\u201d expressed by a statute. 377 U. S., at 433. As Chief Judge\nEasterbrook explained in dissent below, the analogy to the present\ncase is obvious:\u201cThe argument goes that,\nbecauseSullivanignored the language of \u00a71982 and drafted\nan \u2018improved\u2019 version of the statute, we are free to do the same\ntoday for \u00a71981, its neighbor. The Supreme Court requires us to\nproceed otherwise.Borakdealt with \u00a714(a) of the\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a778n(a). It was\nas freewheeling in \u2018interpreting\u2019 that law asSullivanwas\nwith \u00a71982. Yet the Court has held that the change of interpretive\nmethod announced inCortapplies to all other sections of\nthe Securities Exchange Act. SeePiperv.Chris-Craft Industries, Inc.,430 U. S. 1(1977)\n(\u00a714(e));Touche Ross & Co.v. Redington,442 U. S. 560(1979) (\u00a717(a)).Borakand similar decisions from the\n1960s have not been overruled, but we have been told in no\nuncertain terms that they must not be extended. Indeed, inVirginia Bankshares, Inc. v.Sandberg,501 U. S. 1083(1991),\nthe Court declined to applyBorakto a portion of \u00a714(a)\nthat had not been involved inBorak. So that case has been\nlimited to a single sentence of one subsection. Why, then, may the\nmethod ofSullivanbe applied to other sections of the\nCivil Rights Act of 1866 despite intervening precedent?\u201d 474\nF.\u00a03d, at 410\u2013411 (citations omitted).",
