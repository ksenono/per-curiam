I also agree with the points\nraised by my concurring colleagues. Courts should not be in the\nbusiness of creating new causes of action under the Alien Tort\nStatute, seepost,at 2\u20135 (Gorsuch, J., concurring in part\nand concurring in judgment), especially when it risks international\nstrife, seepost,at 3\u20137 (Alito, J., concurring in part and\nconcurring in judgment). And the Alien Tort Statute likely does not\napply to suits between foreign plaintiffs and foreign defendants.\nSeepost,at 5\u201314 (opinion of Gorsuch, J.).",
