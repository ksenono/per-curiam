S. ____ (2011)SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESNO. 09-1163GLEN SCOTT MILNER, PETITIONERv.DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVYon writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the ninth circuit[March 7, 2011]Justice Alito, concurring.I agree with the Court that the\ntext of Exemption 2 of the Freedom of Information Act of 1966\ncannot support the \u201cHigh 2\u201d interpretation that courts have adopted\nand applied over the years. As the Court explains, however, the\nGovernment may avail itself of numerous other exemptions, seeante, at 18\u2014exemptions that may have been overshadowed in\nrecent years by the broad reach of High 2. I write separately to\nunderscore the alternative argument that the Navy raised below,\nwhich rested on Exemption 7(F) and which will remain open on\nremand. Seeante, at 5, n.\u00a03, 18.Exemption 7 applies to specific categories of\ninformation \u201ccompiled for law enforcement purposes.\u201d 5 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a7552(b)(7). In particular, Exemption 7(F) permits\nwithholding of \u201crecords or information compiled for law enforcement\npurposes\u201d that, if disclosed, \u201ccould reasonably be expected to\nendanger the life or physical safety of any individual.\u201d\n\u00a7552(b)(7)(F). In most cases involving security information, it is\nnot difficult to show that disclosure may \u201cendanger the life or\nphysical safety of any individual.\u201d A more difficult question,\nhowever, is whether the information is \u201ccompiled for law\nenforcement purposes.\u201d SeeJohn Doe Agencyv.John Doe\nCorp.,493 U.\nS. 146, 153 (1989) (\u201cBefore it may invoke [Exemption 7], the\nGovernment has the burden of proving the existence of \u2026 a\ncompilation for such a purpose\u201d). In my view, this phrase\nreasonably encompasses information used to fulfill official\nsecurity and crime prevention duties.\u201cLaw enforcement purposes.\u201dThe\nordinary understanding of law enforcement includes not just the\ninvestigation and prosecution of offenses that have already been\ncommitted, but also proactive steps designed to prevent criminal\nactivity and to maintain security. A \u201claw enforcement officer\u201d is\ndefined as one \u201cwhose duty it is to preserve the peace,\u201d Black\u2019s\nLaw Dictionary 796 (5th ed. 1979), and fulfilling that duty\ninvolves a range of activities. Police on the beat aim to prevent\ncrime from occurring, and they no less carry out \u201claw enforcement\npurposes\u201d than officers investigating a crime scene. Similarly, a\n\u201claw-enforcement agency\u201d is charged with \u201cthe apprehension of\nalleged offendersas well as crime detection and\nprevention.\u201d R. De Sola, Crime Dictionary 82 (1982) (emphasis\nadded).Crime prevention and security measures are\ncritical to effective law enforcement as we know it. There can be\nno doubt, for example, that the Secret Service acts with a law\nenforcement purpose when it protects federal officials from attack,\neven though no investigation may be ongoing. Likewise, steps by law\nenforcement officers to prevent terrorism surely fulfill \u201claw\nenforcement purposes.\u201d Particularly in recent years, terrorism\nprevention and national security measures have been recognized as\nvital to effective law enforcement efforts in our Nation. Indeed,\n\u201c[a]fter the September 11th attacks on America,\u201d the priorities of\nthe Federal Bureau of Investigation \u201cshifted dramatically,\u201d and the\nFBI\u2019s \u201ctop priority became the prevention of another terrorist\nattack.\u201d Hearings before the Subcommittee on Science, the\nDepartments of State, Justice, and Commerce, and Related Agencies\nof the House Committee on Appropriations, 109th Cong., 2d Sess.,\npt. 10, 232 (2006) (testimony of FBI Director Robert S. Mueller\nIII). Today, \u201c[t]he FBI\u2019s number one priority continues to be the\nprevention of terrorist attacks against the United States.\u201d\nHearings before the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and\nGovernmental Affairs, 111th Cong., 2d Sess, p.\u00a0___ (Sept. 22,\n2010) (testimony of Mueller). If crime prevention and security\nmeasures do not serve \u201claw enforcement purposes,\u201d then those\ncharged with law enforcement responsibilities have little chance of\nfulfilling their duty to preserve the peace.The context of Exemption 7 confirms that, read\nnaturally, \u201claw enforcement purposes\u201d involve more than just\ninvestigation and prosecution. As Exemption 7\u2019s subparagraphs\ndemonstrate, Congress knew how to refer to these narrower\nactivities. See,e.g., \u00a7552(b)(7)(A) (information that\n\u201ccould reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement\nproceedings\u201d); \u00a7552(b)(7)(E) (information that \u201cwould disclose\ntechniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations or\nprosecutions\u201d). Congress\u2019 decision to use different language to\ntrigger Exemption 7 confirms that the concept of \u201claw enforcement\npurposes\u201d sweeps in activities beyond investigation and\nprosecution. SeeSosav.Alvarez-Machain,542 U. S. 692,\n711, n. 9 (2004) (applying the \u201cusual rule\u201d that \u201c\u00a0when the\nlegis- lature uses certain language in one part of the statute and\ndifferent language in another, the court assumes dif- ferent\nmeanings were intended\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).\u201cCompiled for law enforcement\npurposes.\u201dThis Court has given a fairly broad meaning to\n\u201ccompiled\u201d under \u00a7552(b)(7). InJohn Doe Agency, we held\nthat information need not have been originally \u201ccompiled for law\nenforcement purposes\u201d to satisfy Exemption 7\u2019s threshold\nrequirement. Rather, \u201ceven though\u00a0\u2026\u00a0documents were put\ntogether at an earlier time for a different purpose,\u201d they may fall\nwithin Exemption 7 if they are later assembled for law enforcement\npurposes. 493 U. S., at 154\u2013155. For example, documents originally\ngathered for routine business purposes may fall within Exemption 7\nif they are later compiled for use in a criminal investigation.\nSimilarly, federal building plans and related information\u2014which may\nhave been compiled originally for architectural planning or\ninternal purposes\u2014may fall within Exemption 7 if that information\nis later compiled and given to law enforcement officers for\nsecurity purposes.Documents compiled for multiple purposes are\nnot nec- essarily deprived of Exemption 7\u2019s protection. The text of\nExemption 7 does not require that the information be compiledsolelyfor law enforcement purposes. Cf.\u00a7552(b)(2) (\u201crelated solely to the internal personnel rules and\npractices of an agency\u201d). Therefore, it may be enough that law\nenforcement purposes are a significant reason for the\ncompilation.In this case, the Navy has a fair argument\nthat the Explosive Safety Quantity Distance (ESQD) information\nfalls within Exemption 7(F). The ESQD information, the Navy argues,\nis used \u201cfor the purpose of identifying and addressing security\nissues\u201d and for the \u201cprotection of people and property on the base,\nas well as in [the] nearby community, from the damage, loss, death,\nor injury that could occur from an accident or breach of security.\u201d\nBrief for Appellee in No. 07\u201336056 (CA9), pp.\u00a039\u201340. If,\nindeed, the ESQD information was compiled as part of an effort to\nprevent crimes of terrorism and to maintain security, there is a\nreasonable argument that the information has been \u201ccompiled for law\nenforcement purposes.\u201d \u00a7552(b)(7). Assuming that this threshold\nrequirement is satisfied, the ESQD information may fall comfortably\nwithin Exemption 7(F).",
