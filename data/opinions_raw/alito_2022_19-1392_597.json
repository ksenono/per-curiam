DOBBS, STATE HEALTH OFFICER OF THE\nMISSISSIPPI DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH, et\u00a0al., PETITIONERSv.JACKSON WOMEN\u2019S HEALTH ORGANIZATION, et\u00a0al.on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the fifth circuit[June 24, 2022]Justice Alito delivered the opinion of the\nCourt.Abortion presents a profound moral issue on\nwhich Americans hold sharply conflicting views. Some believe\nfervently that a human person comes into being at conception and\nthat abortion ends an innocent life. Others feel just as strongly\nthat any regulation of abortion invades a woman\u2019s right to control\nher own body and prevents women from achieving full equality. Still\nothers in a third group think that abortion should be allowed under\nsome but not all circumstances, and those within this group hold a\nvariety of views about the particular restrictions that should be\nimposed.For the first 185 years after the adoption of\nthe Constitution, each State was permitted to address this issue in\naccordance with the views of its citizens. Then, in 1973, this\nCourt decidedRoev.Wade,410\nU.S. 113. Even though the Constitution makes no mention of\nabortion, the Court held that it confers a broad right to obtain\none. It did not claim that American law or the common law had ever\nrecognized such a right, and its survey of history ranged from the\nconstitutionally irrelevant (e.g., its discussion of\nabortion in antiquity) to the plainly incorrect (e.g., its\nassertion that abortion was probably never a crime under the common\nlaw). After cataloging a wealth of other information having no\nbearing on the meaning of the Constitution, the opinion concluded\nwith a numbered set of rules much like those that might be found in\na statute enacted by a legislature.Under this scheme, each trimester of pregnancy\nwas regulated differently, but the most critical line was drawn at\nroughly the end of the second trimester, which, at the time,\ncorresponded to the point at which a fetus was thought to achieve\n\u201cviability,\u201di.e., the ability to survive outside the womb.\nAlthough the Court acknowledged that States had a legitimate\ninterest in protecting \u201cpotential life,\u201d[1] it found that this interest could not justify any\nrestriction on pre-viability abortions. The Court did not explain\nthe basis for this line, and even abortion supporters have found it\nhard to defendRoe\u2019s reasoning. One prominent constitutional\nscholar wrote that he \u201cwould vote for a statute very much like the\none the Court end[ed] up drafting\u201d if he were \u201ca legislator,\u201d but\nhis assessment ofRoewas memorable and brutal:Roewas \u201cnot constitutional law\u201d at all and gave \u201calmost no sense of an\nobligation to try to be.\u201d[2]At the time ofRoe, 30 States still\nprohibited abortion at all stages. In the years prior to that\ndecision, about a third of the States had liberalized their laws,\nbutRoeabruptly ended that political process. It imposed\nthe same highly restrictive regime on the entire Nation, and it\neffectively struck down the abortion laws of every single\nState.[3] As Justice Byron\nWhite aptly put it in his dissent, the decision represented the\n\u201cexercise of raw judicial power,\u201d 410 U.\u00a0S., at 222, and it\nsparked a national controversy that has embittered our political\nculture for a half century.[4]Eventually, inPlanned Parenthood of\nSoutheastern Pa.v.Casey,505 U.S.\n833(1992), the Court revisitedRoe, but the Members of\nthe Court split three ways. Two Justices expressed no desire to\nchangeRoein any way.[5] Four others wanted to overrule the decision in its\nentirety.[6] And the three\nremaining Justices, who jointly signed the controlling opinion,\ntook a third position.[7] Their\nopinion did not endorseRoe\u2019s reasoning, and it even hinted\nthat one or more of its authors might have \u201creservations\u201d about\nwhether the Constitution protects a right to abortion.[8] But the opinion concluded thatstare decisis, which calls for prior decisions to be\nfollowed in most instances, required adherence to what it calledRoe\u2019s \u201ccentral holding\u201d\u2014that a State may not\nconstitutionally protect fetal life before \u201cviability\u201d\u2014even if that\nholding was wrong.[9] Anything\nless, the opinion claimed, would undermine respect for this Court\nand the rule of law.Paradoxically, the judgment inCaseydid\na fair amount of overruling. Several important abortion decisions\nwere overruledin toto, andRoeitself was overruled\nin part.[10]Caseythrew outRoe\u2019s trimester scheme and substituted a new rule\nof uncertain origin under which States were forbidden to adopt any\nregulation that imposed an \u201cundue burden\u201d on a woman\u2019s right to\nhave an abortion.[11] The\ndecision provided no clear guidance about the difference between a\n\u201cdue\u201d and an \u201cundue\u201d burden. But the three Justices who authored\nthe controlling opinion \u201ccall[ed] the contending sides of a\nnational controversy to end their national division\u201d by treating\nthe Court\u2019s decision as the final settlement of the question of the\nconstitutional right to abortion.[12]As has become increasingly apparent in the\nintervening years,Caseydid not achieve that goal.\nAmericans continue to hold passionate and widely divergent views on\nabortion, and state legislatures have acted accordingly. Some have\nrecently enacted laws allowing abortion, with few restrictions, at\nall stages of pregnancy. Others have tightly restricted abortion\nbeginning well before viability. And in this case, 26 States have\nexpressly asked this Court to overruleRoeandCaseyand allow the States to regulate or prohibit pre-viability\nabortions.Before us now is one such state law. The State\nof Mississippi asks us to uphold the constitutionality of a law\nthat generally prohibits an abortion after the 15th week of\npregnancy\u2014several weeks before the point at which a fetus is now\nregarded as \u201cviable\u201d outside the womb. In defending this law, the\nState\u2019s primary argument is that we should reconsider and overruleRoeandCaseyand once again allow each State to\nregulate abortion as its citizens wish. On the other side,\nrespondents and the Solicitor General ask us to reaffirmRoeandCasey, and they contend that the Mississippi law cannot\nstand if we do so. Allowing Mississippi to prohibit abortions after\n15 weeks of pregnancy, they argue, \u201cwould be no different than\noverrulingCaseyandRoeentirely.\u201d Brief for\nRespondents 43. They contend that \u201cno half-measures\u201d are available\nand that we must either reaffirm or overruleRoeandCasey. Brief for Respondents 50.We hold thatRoeandCasey must be\noverruled. The Constitution makes no reference to abortion, and no\nsuch right is implicitly protected by any constitutional provision,\nincluding the one on which the defenders ofRoeandCaseynow chiefly rely\u2014the Due Process Clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment. That provision has been held to guarantee\nsome rights that are not mentioned in the Constitution, but any\nsuch right must be \u201cdeeply rooted in this Nation\u2019s history and\ntradition\u201d and \u201cimplicit in the concept of ordered liberty.\u201dWashingtonv. Glucksberg,521\nU.S. 702, 721 (1997) (internal quotation marks omitted).The right to abortion does not fall within this\ncategory. Until the latter part of the 20th century, such a right\nwas entirely unknown in American law. Indeed, when the Fourteenth\nAmendment was adopted, three quarters of the States made abortion a\ncrime at all stages of pregnancy. The abortion right is also\ncritically different from any other right that this Court has held\nto fall within the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s protection of \u201cliberty.\u201dRoe\u2019s defenders characterize the abortion right as similar\nto the rights recognized in past decisions involving matters such\nas intimate sexual relations, contraception, and marriage, but\nabortion is fundamentally different, as bothRoeandCaseyacknowledged, because it destroys what those decisions\ncalled \u201cfetal life\u201d and what the law now before us describes as an\n\u201cunborn human being.\u201d[13]Stare decisis, the doctrine on whichCasey\u2019s controlling opinion was based, does not compel\nunending adherence toRoe\u2019s abuse of judicial authority.Roewas egregiously wrong from the start. Its reasoning was\nexceptionally weak, and the decision has had damaging consequences.\nAnd far from bringing about a national settlement of the abortion\nissue,RoeandCaseyhave enflamed debate and\ndeepened division.It is time to heed the Constitution and return\nthe issue of abortion to the people\u2019s elected representatives. \u201cThe\npermissibility of abortion, and the limitations, upon it, are to be\nresolved like most important questions in our democracy: by\ncitizens trying to persuade one another and then voting.\u201dCasey, 505 U.\u00a0S., at 979 (Scalia, J., concurring in\njudgment in part and dissenting in part). That is what the\nConstitution and the rule of law demand.IThe law at issue in this case, Mississippi\u2019s\nGestational Age Act, see Miss. Code Ann. \u00a741\u201341\u2013191 (2018),\ncontains this central provision: \u201cExcept in a medical emergency or\nin the case of a severe fetal abnormality, a person shall not\nintentionally or knowingly perform .\u00a0.\u00a0. or induce an\nabortion of an unborn human being if the probable gestational age\nof the unborn human being has been determined to be greater than\nfifteen (15) weeks.\u201d \u00a74(b).[14]To support this Act, the legislature made a\nseries of factual findings. It began by noting that, at the time of\nenactment, only six countries besides the United States\n\u201cpermit[ted] nontherapeutic or elective abortion-on-demand after\nthe twentieth week of gestation.\u201d[15] \u00a72(a). The legislature then found that at 5 or 6\nweeks\u2019 gestational age an \u201cunborn human being\u2019s heart begins\nbeating\u201d; at 8 weeks the \u201cunborn human being begins to move about\nin the womb\u201d; at 9 weeks \u201call basic physiological functions are\npresent\u201d; at 10 weeks \u201cvital organs begin to function,\u201d and\n\u201c[h]air, fingernails, and toenails .\u00a0.\u00a0. begin to form\u201d;\nat 11 weeks \u201can unborn human being\u2019s diaphragm is developing,\u201d and\nhe or she may \u201cmove about freely in the womb\u201d; and at 12 weeks the\n\u201cunborn human being\u201d has \u201ctaken on \u2018the human form\u2019 in all relevant\nrespects.\u201d \u00a72(b)(i) (quotingGonzalesv.Carhart,550 U.S.\n124, 160 (2007)). It found that most abortions after 15 weeks\nemploy \u201cdilation and evacuation procedures which involve the use of\nsurgical instruments to crush and tear the unborn child,\u201d and it\nconcluded that the \u201cintentional commitment of such acts for\nnontherapeutic or elective reasons is a barbaric practice,\ndangerous for the maternal patient, and demeaning to the medical\nprofession.\u201d \u00a72(b)(i)(8).Respondents are an abortion clinic, Jackson\nWomen\u2019s Health Organization, and one of its doctors. On the day the\nGestational Age Act was enacted, respondents filed suit in Federal\nDistrict Court against various Mississippi officials, alleging that\nthe Act violated this Court\u2019s precedents establishing a\nconstitutional right to abortion. The District Court granted\nsummary judgment in favor of respondents and permanently enjoined\nenforcement of the Act, reasoning that \u201cviability marks the\nearliest point at which the State\u2019s interest in fetal life is\nconstitutionally adequate to justify a legislative ban on\nnontherapeutic abortions\u201d and that 15 weeks\u2019 gestational age is\n\u201cprior to viability.\u201dJackson Women\u2019s Health Org.v.Currier, 349 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d 536, 539\u2013540 (SD Miss. 2019)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). The Fifth Circuit affirmed. 945\nF.3d 265 (2019).We granted certiorari, 593 U.\u00a0S. ___\n(2021), to resolve the question whether \u201call pre-viability\nprohibitions on elective abortions are unconstitutional,\u201d Pet. for\nCert. i. Petitioners\u2019 primary defense of the Mississippi\nGestational Age Act is thatRoeandCaseywere\nwrongly decided and that \u201cthe Act is constitutional because it\nsatisfies rational-basis review.\u201d Brief for Petitioners 49.\nRespondents answer that allowing Mississippi to ban pre-viability\nabortions \u201cwould be no different than overrulingCaseyandRoeentirely.\u201d Brief for Respondents 43. They tell us that\n\u201cno half-measures\u201d are available: We must either reaffirm or\noverruleRoeandCasey. Brief for Respondents 50.IIWe begin by considering the critical question\nwhether the Constitution, properly understood, confers a right to\nobtain an abortion. Skipping over that question, the controlling\nopinion inCaseyreaffirmedRoe\u2019s \u201ccentral holding\u201d\nbased solely on the doctrine ofstare decisis, but as we\nwill explain, proper application ofstare decisisrequired\nan assessment of the strength of the grounds on whichRoewas based. Seeinfra,at 45\u201356.We therefore turn to the question that theCaseyplurality did not consider, and we address that\nquestion in three steps. First, we explain the standard that our\ncases have used in determining whether the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s\nreference to \u201cliberty\u201d protects a particular right. Second, we\nexamine whether the right at issue in this case is rooted in our\nNation\u2019s history and tradition and whether it is an essential\ncomponent of what we have described as \u201cordered liberty.\u201d Finally,\nwe consider whether a right to obtain an abortion is part of a\nbroader entrenched right that is supported by other precedents.A1Constitutional analysis must begin with \u201cthe\nlanguage of the instrument,\u201dGibbonsv.Ogden, 9\nWheat. 1, 186\u2013189 (1824), which offers a \u201cfixed standard\u201d for\nascertaining what our founding document means, 1 J. Story,\nCommentaries on the Constitution of the United States \u00a7399, p. 383\n(1833). The Constitution makes no express reference to a right to\nobtain an abortion, and therefore those who claim that it protects\nsuch a right must show that the right is somehow implicit in the\nconstitutional text.Roe,however, was remarkably loose in its\ntreatment of the constitutional text. It held that the abortion\nright, which is not mentioned in the Constitution, is part of a\nright to privacy, which is also not mentioned. See 410 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 152\u2013153. And that privacy right,Roeobserved, had been\nfound to spring from no fewer than five different constitutional\nprovisions\u2014the First, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and Fourteenth\nAmendments.Id., at 152.The Court\u2019s discussion left open at least three\nways in which some combination of these provisions could protect\nthe abortion right. One possibility was that the right was \u201cfounded\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. in the Ninth Amendment\u2019s reservation of rights to\nthe people.\u201dId.,at 153. Another was that the right was\nrooted in the First, Fourth, or Fifth Amendment, or in some\ncombination of those provisions, and that this right had been\n\u201cincorporated\u201d into the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment just as many other Bill of Rights provisions had by then\nbeen incorporated.Ibid; see alsoMcDonaldv.Chicago,561 U.S.\n742, 763\u2013766 (2010) (majority opinion) (discussing\nincorporation). And a third path was that the First, Fourth, and\nFifth Amendments played no role and that the right was simply a\ncomponent of the \u201cliberty\u201d protected by the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s\nDue Process Clause.Roe, 410 U.\u00a0S., at 153.Roeexpressed the \u201cfeel[ing]\u201d that the Fourteenth Amendment was the\nprovision that did the work, but its message seemed to be that the\nabortion right could be foundsomewherein the Constitution\nand that specifying its exact location was not of paramount\nimportance.[16] TheCaseyCourt did not defend this unfocused analysis and\ninstead grounded its decision solely on the theory that the right\nto obtain an abortion is part of the \u201cliberty\u201d protected by the\nFourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause.We discuss this theory in depth below, but\nbefore doing so, we briefly address one additional constitutional\nprovision that some of respondents\u2019amicihave now offered\nas yet another potential home for the abortion right: the\nFourteenth Amendment\u2019s Equal Protection Clause. See Brief for\nUnited States asAmicus Curiae24 (Brief for United States);\nsee also Brief for Equal Protection Constitutional Law Scholars asAmici Curiae.NeitherRoenorCaseysaw fit to\ninvoke this theory, and it is squarely foreclosed by our\nprecedents, which establish that a State\u2019s regulation of abortion\nis not a sex-based classification and is thus not subject to the\n\u201cheightened scrutiny\u201d that applies to such\nclassifications.[17] The\nregulation of a medical procedure that only one sex can undergo\ndoes not trigger heightened constitutional scrutiny unless the\nregulation is a \u201cmere pretex[t] designed to effect an invidious\ndiscrimination against members of one sex or the other.\u201dGeduldigv.Aiello,417 U.S.\n484, 496, n. 20 (1974). And as the Court has stated, the \u201cgoal\nof preventing abortion\u201d does not constitute \u201cinvidiously\ndiscriminatory animus\u201d against women.Brayv.Alexandria\nWomen\u2019s Health Clinic,506 U.S.\n263, 273\u2013274 (1993) (internal quotation marks omitted).\nAccordingly, laws regulating or prohibiting abortion are not\nsubject to heightened scrutiny. Rather, they are governed by the\nsame standard of review as other health and safety\nmeasures.[18]With this new theory addressed, we turn toCasey\u2019s bold assertion that the abortion right is an aspect\nof the \u201cliberty\u201d protected by the Due Process Clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment. 505 U.\u00a0S., at 846; Brief for Respondents\n17; Brief for United States 21\u201322.2The underlying theory on which this argument\nrests\u2014that the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause provides\nsubstantive, as well as procedural, protection for \u201cliberty\u201d\u2014has\nlong been controversial. But our decisions have held that the Due\nProcess Clause protects two categories of substantive rights.The first consists of rights guaranteed by the\nfirst eight Amendments. Those Amendments originally applied only to\nthe Federal Government,Barron ex rel. Tiernanv.Mayor\nof Baltimore, 7 Pet. 243, 247\u2013251 (1833) (opinion for the Court\nby Marshall, C.\u00a0J.), but this Court has held that the Due\nProcess Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment \u201cincorporates\u201d the great\nmajority of those rights and thus makes them equally applicable to\nthe States. SeeMcDonald, 561 U.\u00a0S., at 763\u2013767, and\nnn. 12\u201313. The second category\u2014which is the one in question\nhere\u2014comprises a select list of fundamental rights that are not\nmentioned anywhere in the Constitution.In deciding whether a right falls into either of\nthese categories, the Court has long asked whether the right is\n\u201cdeeply rooted in [our] history and tradition\u201d and whether it is\nessential to our Nation\u2019s \u201cscheme of ordered liberty.\u201dTimbsv.Indiana, 586 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2019) (slip op., at 3)\n(internal quotation marks omitted);McDonald, 561\nU.\u00a0S., at 764, 767 (internal quotation marks omitted);Glucksberg, 521 U.\u00a0S., at 721 (internal quotation marks\nomitted).[19] And in\nconducting this inquiry, we have engaged in a careful analysis of\nthe history of the right at issue.Justice Ginsburg\u2019s opinion for the Court inTimbsis a recent example. In concluding that the Eighth\nAmendment\u2019s protection against excessive fines is \u201cfundamental to\nour scheme of ordered liberty\u201d and \u201cdeeply rooted in this Nation\u2019s\nhistory and tradition,\u201d 586 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 7)\n(internal quotation marks omitted), her opinion traced the right\nback to Magna Carta, Blackstone\u2019s Commentaries, and 35 of the 37\nstate constitutions in effect at the ratification of the Fourteenth\nAmendment. 586 U.\u00a0S., at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 3\u20137).A similar inquiry was undertaken inMcDonald, which held that the Fourteenth Amendment protects\nthe right to keep and bear arms. The lead opinion surveyed the\norigins of the Second Amendment, the debates in Congress about the\nadoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, the state constitutions in\neffect when that Amendment was ratified (at least 22 of the 37\nStates protected the right to keep and bear arms), federal laws\nenacted during the same period, and other relevant historical\nevidence. 561 U.\u00a0S., at 767\u2013777. Only then did the opinion\nconclude that \u201cthe Framers and ratifiers of the Fourteenth\nAmendment counted the right to keep and bear arms among those\nfundamental rights necessary to our system of ordered liberty.\u201dId., at 778; see alsoid., at 822\u2013850 (Thomas, J.,\nconcurring in part and concurring in judgment) (surveying history\nand reaching the same result under the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s\nPrivileges or Immunities Clause).TimbsandMcDonaldconcerned the\nquestion whether the Fourteenth Amendment protects rights that are\nexpressly set out in the Bill of Rights, and it would be anomalous\nif similar historical support were not required when a putative\nright is not mentioned anywhere in the Constitution. Thus, inGlucksberg, which held that the Due Process Clause does not\nconfer a right to assisted suicide, the Court surveyed more than\n700 years of \u201cAnglo-American common law tradition,\u201d 521 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 711, and made clear that a fundamental right must be\n\u201cobjectively, deeply rooted in this Nation\u2019s history and\ntradition,\u201did., at 720\u2013721.Historical inquiries of this nature are\nessential whenever we are asked to recognize a new component of the\n\u201cliberty\u201d protected by the Due Process Clause because the term\n\u201cliberty\u201d alone provides little guidance. \u201cLiberty\u201d is a capacious\nterm. As Lincoln once said: \u201cWe all declare for Liberty; but in\nusing the same word we do not all mean the same thing.\u201d[20] In a well-known essay, Isaiah\nBerlin reported that \u201c[h]istorians of ideas\u201d had cataloged more\nthan 200 different senses in which the term had been used.[21]In interpreting what is meant by the Fourteenth\nAmendment\u2019s reference to \u201cliberty,\u201d we must guard against the\nnatural human tendency to confuse what that Amendment protects with\nour own ardent views about the liberty that Americans should enjoy.\nThat is why the Court has long been \u201creluctant\u201d to recognize rights\nthat are not mentioned in the Constitution.Collinsv.Harker Heights,503 U.S.\n115, 125 (1992). \u201cSubstantive due process has at times been a\ntreacherous field for this Court,\u201dMoorev.East\nCleveland,431\nU.S. 494, 503 (1977) (plurality opinion), and it has sometimes\nled the Court to usurp authority that the Constitution entrusts to\nthe people\u2019s elected representatives. SeeRegents of Univ. of\nMich.v.Ewing,474 U.S.\n214, 225\u2013226 (1985). As the Court cautioned inGlucksberg, \u201c[w]e must .\u00a0.\u00a0. exercise the utmost\ncare whenever we are asked to break new ground in this field, lest\nthe liberty protected by the Due Process Clause be subtly\ntransformed into the policy preferences of the Members of this\nCourt.\u201d 521 U.\u00a0S., at 720 (internal quotation marks and\ncitation omitted).On occasion, when the Court has ignored the\n\u201c[a]ppropriate limits\u201d imposed by \u201c\u00a0\u2018respect for the teachings\nof history,\u2019\u00a0\u201dMoore,431 U.\u00a0S., at 503 (plurality\nopinion), it has fallen into the freewheeling judicial policymaking\nthat characterized discredited decisions such asLochnerv.New York,198 U.S.\n45(1905). The Court must not fall prey to such an unprincipled\napproach. Instead, guided by the history and tradition that map the\nessential components of our Nation\u2019s concept of ordered liberty, we\nmust ask what theFourteenth Amendmentmeans by the term\n\u201cliberty.\u201d When we engage in that inquiry in the present case, the\nclear answer is that the Fourteenth Amendment does not protect the\nright to an abortion.[22]B1Until the latter part of the 20th century,\nthere was no support in American law for a constitutional right to\nobtain an abortion. No state constitutional provision had\nrecognized such a right. Until a few years beforeRoewas\nhanded down, no federal or state court had recognized such a right.\nNor had any scholarly treatise of which we are aware. And although\nlaw review articles are not reticent about advocating new rights,\nthe earliest article proposing a constitutional right to abortion\nthat has come to our attention was published only a few years\nbeforeRoe.[23]Not only was there no support for such a\nconstitutional right until shortly beforeRoe, but abortion\nhad long been acrimein every single State. At common law,\nabortion was criminal in at least some stages of pregnancy and was\nregarded as unlawful and could have very serious consequences at\nall stages. American law followed the common law until a wave of\nstatutory restrictions in the 1800s expanded criminal liability for\nabortions. By the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment,\nthree-quarters of the States had made abortion a crime at any stage\nof pregnancy, and the remaining States would soon follow.Roeeither ignored or misstated this\nhistory, andCaseydeclined to reconsiderRoe\u2019s\nfaulty historical analysis. It is therefore important to set the\nrecord straight.2aWe begin with the common law, under which\nabortion was a crime at least after \u201cquickening\u201d\u2014i.e., the\nfirst felt movement of the fetus in the womb, which usually occurs\nbetween the 16th and 18th week of pregnancy.[24]The \u201ceminent common-law authorities (Blackstone,\nCoke, Hale, and the like),\u201dKahlerv.Kansas, 589\nU.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2020) (slip op., at 7),alldescribe\nabortion after quickening as criminal. Henry de Bracton\u2019s\n13th-century treatise explained that if a person has \u201cstruck a\npregnant woman, or has given her poison, whereby he has caused\nabortion, if the foetus be already formed and animated, and\nparticularly if it be animated, he commits homicide.\u201d 2 De Legibus\net Consuetudinibus Angliae 279 (T. Twiss ed. 1879); see also 1\nFleta, c. 23, reprinted in 72 Selden Soc. 60\u201361 (H. Richardson\n& G. Sayles eds. 1955) (13th-century treatise).[25]Sir Edward Coke\u2019s 17th-century treatise likewise\nasserted that abortion of a quick child was \u201cmurder\u201d if the \u201cchilde\nbe born alive\u201d and a \u201cgreat misprision\u201d if the \u201cchilde dieth in her\nbody.\u201d 3 Institutes of the Laws of England 50\u201351 (1644).\n(\u201cMisprision\u201d referred to \u201csome heynous offence under the degree of\nfelony.\u201dId., at 139.) Two treatises by Sir Matthew Hale\nlikewise described abortion of a quick child who died in the womb\nas a \u201cgreat crime\u201d and a \u201cgreat misprision.\u201d Pleas of the Crown 53\n(P. Glazebrook ed. 1972); 1 History of the Pleas of the Crown 433\n(1736) (Hale). And writing near the time of the adoption of our\nConstitution, William Blackstone explained that abortion of a\n\u201cquick\u201d child was \u201cby the ancient law homicide or manslaughter\u201d\n(citing Bracton), and at least a very \u201cheinous misdemeanor\u201d (citing\nCoke). 1 Commentaries on the Laws of England 129\u2013130 (7th ed. 1775)\n(Blackstone).English cases dating all the way back to the\n13th century corroborate the treatises\u2019 statements that abortion\nwas a crime. See generally J. Dellapenna, Dispelling the Myths of\nAbortion History 126, and n. 16, 134\u2013142, 188\u2013194, and nn. 84\u201386\n(2006) (Dellapenna); J. Keown, Abortion, Doctors and the Law 3\u201312\n(1988) (Keown). In 1732, for example, Eleanor Beare was convicted\nof \u201cdestroying the Foetus in the Womb\u201d of another woman and\n\u201cthereby causing her to miscarry.\u201d[26] For that crime and another \u201cmisdemeanor,\u201d Beare was\nsentenced to two days in the pillory and three years\u2019\nimprisonment.[27]Although a pre-quickening abortion was not\nitself considered homicide, it does not follow that abortion waspermissibleat common law\u2014much less that abortion was a\nlegalright. Cf.Glucksberg, 521 U.\u00a0S., at 713\n(removal of \u201ccommon law\u2019s harsh sanctions did not represent an\nacceptance of suicide\u201d). Quite to the contrary, in the 1732 case\nmentioned above, the judge said of the charge of abortion (with no\nmention of quickening) that he had \u201cnever met with a case so\nbarbarous and unnatural.\u201d[28] Similarly, an indictment from 1602, which did not\ndistinguish between a pre-quickening and post-quickening abortion,\ndescribed abortion as \u201cpernicious\u201d and \u201cagainst the peace of our\nLady the Queen, her crown and dignity.\u201d Keown 7 (discussingR.v.Webb, Calendar of Assize Records, Surrey\nIndictments 512 (1980)).That the common law did not condone even pre-\nquickening abortions is confirmed by what one might call a\nproto-felony-murder rule. Hale and Blackstone explained a way in\nwhich a pre-quickening abortion could rise to the level of a\nhomicide. Hale wrote that if a physician gave a woman \u201cwith\nchild\u201da \u201cpotion\u201d to cause an abortion, and the woman died,\nit was \u201cmurder\u201d because the potion was given \u201cunlawfullyto\ndestroy her child within her.\u201d 1 Hale 429\u2013430 (emphasis added). As\nBlackstone explained, to be \u201cmurder\u201d a killing had to be done with\n\u201cmalice aforethought, .\u00a0.\u00a0. either express or implied.\u201d 4\nBlackstone 198 (emphasis deleted). In the case of an abortionist,\nBlackstone wrote, \u201cthe law will imply [malice]\u201d for the same reason\nthat it would imply malice if a person who intended to kill one\nperson accidentally killed a different person:\u201c[I]f one shoots at A and misseshim, but kills B, this is murder; because of the previous\nfelonious intent, which the law transfers from one to the other.\nThe same is the case, where one lays poison for A; and B, against\nwhom the prisoner had no malicious intent, takes it, and it kills\nhim; this is likewise murder.So also, if one givesa\nwoman with childa medicine to procure abortion, and it\noperates so violently as to kill the woman,this is murderin the person who gave it.\u201dId., at 200\u2013201 (emphasis added;\nfootnote omitted).[29]Notably, Blackstone, like Hale, did not state\nthat this proto-felony-murder rule required that the woman be \u201cwith\nquick child\u201d\u2014only that she be \u201cwith child.\u201dId., at 201. And\nit is revealing that Hale and Blackstone treated abortionists\ndifferently fromotherphysicians or surgeons who caused the\ndeath of a patient \u201cwithout any intent of doing [the patient] any\nbodily hurt.\u201d Hale 429; see 4 Blackstone 197. These other\nphysicians\u2014even if \u201cunlicensed\u201d\u2014would not be \u201cguilty of murder or\nmanslaughter.\u201d Hale 429. But a physician performing an abortion\nwould, precisely because his aim was an \u201cunlawful\u201d one.In sum, although common-law authorities differed\non the severity of punishment for abortions committed at different\npoints in pregnancy, none endorsed the practice. Moreover, we are\naware of no common-law case or authority, and the parties have not\npointed to any, that remotely suggests a positiverightto\nprocure an abortion at any stage of pregnancy.bIn this country, the historical record is\nsimilar. The \u201cmost important early American edition of Blackstone\u2019s\nCommentaries,\u201dDistrict of Columbiav.Heller,554 U.S.\n570, 594 (2008), reported Blackstone\u2019s statement that abortion\nof a quick child was at least \u201ca heinous misdemeanor,\u201d 2 St. George\nTucker, Blackstone\u2019s Commentaries 129\u2013130 (1803), and that edition\nalso included Blackstone\u2019s discussion of the proto-felony-murder\nrule, 5id., at 200\u2013201. Manuals for justices of the peace\nprinted in the Colonies in the 18th century typically restated the\ncommon-law rule on abortion, and some manuals repeated Hale\u2019s and\nBlackstone\u2019s statements that anyone who prescribed medication\n\u201cunlawfully to destroy the child\u201d would be guilty of murder if the\nwoman died. See,e.g., J. Parker, Conductor Generalis 220\n(1788); 2 R. Burn, Justice of the Peace, and Parish Officer 221\u2013222\n(7th ed. 1762) (English manual stating the same).[30]The few cases available from the early colonial\nperiod corroborate that abortion was a crime. See generally\nDellapenna 215\u2013228 (collecting cases). In Maryland in 1652, for\nexample, an indictment charged that a man \u201cMurtherously endeavoured\nto destroy or Murther the Child by him begotten in the Womb.\u201dProprietaryv.Mitchell, 10 Md. Archives 80, 183\n(1652) (W. Browne ed. 1891). And by the 19th century, courts\nfrequently explained that the common law made abortion of a quick\nchild a crime. See,e.g.,Smithv.Gaffard, 31\nAla. 45, 51 (1857);Smithv.State, 33 Me. 48, 55\n(1851);Statev.Cooper, 22 N. J. L. 52, 52\u201355\n(1849);Commonwealthv.Parker, 50 Mass. 263, 264\u2013268\n(1845).cThe original ground for drawing a distinction\nbetween pre- and post-quickening abortions is not entirely clear,\nbut some have attributed the rule to the difficulty of proving that\na pre-quickening fetus was alive. At that time, there were no\nscientific methods for detecting pregnancy in its early\nstages,[31] and thus, as one\ncourt put it in 1872: \u201c[U]ntil the period of quickening there is noevidenceof life; and whatever may be said of the feotus,\nthe law has fixed upon this period of gestation as the time when\nthe child is endowed with life\u201d because \u201cfoetal movements are the\nfirst clearly marked and well definedevidencesof\nlife.\u201dEvansv.People, 49 N.Y. 86, 90 (emphasis\nadded);Cooper, 22 N.\u00a0J.\u00a0L., at 56 (\u201cIn\ncontemplation of law life commences at the moment of quickening, at\nthat moment when the embryo givesthe first physical proof of\nlife, no matter when it first received it\u201d (emphasis\nadded)).The Solicitor General offers a different\nexplanation of the basis for the quickening rule, namely, that\nbefore quickening the common law did not regard a fetus \u201cas having\na \u2018separate and independent existence.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Brief for United\nStates 26 (quotingParker, 50 Mass., at 266). But the case\non which the Solicitor General relies for this proposition also\nsuggested that the criminal law\u2019s quickening rule was out of step\nwith the treatment of prenatal life in other areas of law, noting\nthat \u201cto many purposes, in reference to civil rights, an infantin ventre sa mereis regarded as a person in being.\u201dIbid. (citing 1 Blackstone 129); see alsoEvans,49\nN.\u00a0Y., at 89;Millsv.Commonwealth, 13 Pa. 631,\n633 (1850);Morrowv.Scott, 7 Ga. 535, 537 (1849);Hallv.Hancock, 32 Mass. 255, 258 (1834);Thellussonv.Woodford, 4 Ves. 227, 321\u2013322, 31 Eng.\nRep. 117, 163 (1789).At any rate, the original ground for the\nquickening rule is of little importance for present purposes\nbecause the rule was abandoned in the 19th century. During that\nperiod, treatise writers and commentators criticized the quickening\ndistinction as \u201cneither in accordance with the result of medical\nexperience, nor with the principles of the common law.\u201d F. Wharton,\nCriminal Law \u00a71220, p. 606 (rev. 4th ed. 1857) (footnotes omitted);\nsee also J. Beck, Researches in Medicine and Medical Jurisprudence\n26\u201328 (2d ed. 1835) (describing the quickening distinction as\n\u201cabsurd\u201d and \u201cinjurious\u201d).[32] In 1803, the British Parliament made abortion a crime\nat all stages of pregnancy and authorized the imposition of severe\npunishment. See Lord Ellenborough\u2019s Act, 43 Geo. 3, c. 58 (1803).\nOne scholar has suggested that Parliament\u2019s decision \u201cmay partly\nhave been attributable to the medical man\u2019s concern that fetal life\nshould be protected by the law at all stages of gestation.\u201d Keown\n22.In this country during the 19th century, the\nvast majority of the States enacted statutes criminalizing abortion\nat all stages of pregnancy. See Appendix A,infra(listing\nstate statutory provisions in chronological order).[33] By 1868, the year when the Fourteenth\nAmendment was ratified, three-quarters of the States, 28 out of 37,\nhad enacted statutes making abortion a crime even if it was\nperformed before quickening.[34] Seeibid.Of the nine States that had not yet\ncriminalized abortion at all stages, all but one did so by 1910.\nSeeibid.The trend in the Territories that would become\nthe last 13 States was similar: All of them criminalized abortion\nat all stages of pregnancy between 1850 (the Kingdom of Hawaii) and\n1919 (New Mexico). See Appendix B,infra; see alsoCasey, 505 U.\u00a0S., at 952 (Rehnquist, C.\u00a0J.,\nconcurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part); Dellapenna\n317\u2013319. By the end of the 1950s, according to theRoeCourt\u2019s own count, statutes in all but four States and the District\nof Columbia prohibited abortion \u201chowever and whenever performed,\nunless done to save or preserve the life of the mother.\u201d 410\nU.\u00a0S., at 139.[35]This overwhelming consensus endured until the\ndayRoewas decided. At that time, also by theRoeCourt\u2019s own count, a substantial majority\u201430 States\u2014still\nprohibited abortion at all stages except to save the life of the\nmother. Seeid., at 118, and n. 2 (listing States). And\nthoughRoediscerned a \u201ctrend toward liberalization\u201d in\nabout \u201cone-third of the States,\u201d those States still criminalized\nsome abortions and regulated them more stringently thanRoewould allow.Id., at 140, and n. 37; Tribe 2. In short, the\n\u201cCourt\u2019s opinion inRoeitself convincingly refutes the\nnotion that the abortion liberty is deeply rooted in the history or\ntradition of our people.\u201dThornburghv.American College\nof Obstetricians and Gynecologists,476\nU.S. 747, 793 (1986) (White, J., dissenting).dThe inescapable conclusion is that a right to\nabortion is not deeply rooted in the Nation\u2019s history and\ntraditions. On the contrary, an unbroken tradition of prohibiting\nabortion on pain of criminal punishment persisted from the earliest\ndays of the common law until 1973. The Court inRoecould\nhave said of abortion exactly whatGlucksbergsaid of\nassisted suicide: \u201cAttitudes toward [abortion] have changed since\nBracton, but our laws have consistently condemned, and continue to\nprohibit, [that practice].\u201d 521 U.\u00a0S., at 719.3Respondents and theiramicihave no\npersuasive answer to this historical evidence.Neither respondents nor the Solicitor General\ndisputes the fact that by 1868 the vast majority of States\ncriminalized abortion at all stages of pregnancy. See Brief for\nPetitioners 12\u201313; see also Brief for American Historical\nAssociation et\u00a0al. asAmici Curiae27\u201328, and nn. 14\u201315\n(conceding that 26 out of 37 States prohibited abortion before\nquickening); Tr. of Oral Arg. 74\u201375 (respondents\u2019 counsel conceding\nthe same). Instead, respondents are forced to argue that it \u201cdoes\n[not] matter that some States prohibited abortion at the timeRoewas decided or when the Fourteenth Amendment was\nadopted.\u201d Brief for Respondents 21. But that argument flies in the\nface of the standard we have applied in determining whether an\nasserted right that is nowhere mentioned in the Constitution is\nnevertheless protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.Not only are respondents and theiramiciunable to show that a constitutional right to abortion was\nestablished when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted, but they\nhave found no support for the existence of an abortion right that\npredates the latter part of the 20th century\u2014no state\nconstitutional provision, no statute, no judicial decision, no\nlearned treatise. The earliest sources called to our attention are\na few district court and state court decisions decided shortly\nbeforeRoeand a small number of law review articles from\nthe same time period.[36]A few of respondents\u2019amicimuster\nhistorical arguments, but they are very weak. The Solicitor General\nrepeatsRoe\u2019s claim that it is \u201c\u00a0\u2018doubtful\u2019\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. \u2018abortion was ever firmly established as a\ncommon-law crime even with respect to the destruction of a quick\nfetus.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Brief for United States 26 (quotingRoe, 410\nU.\u00a0S., at 136). But as we have seen, great common-law\nauthorities like Bracton, Coke, Hale, and Blackstone all wrote that\na post-quickening abortion was a crime\u2014and a serious one at that.\nMoreover, Hale and Blackstone (and many other authorities following\nthem) asserted that even a pre-quickening abortion was \u201cunlawful\u201d\nand that, as a result, an abortionist was guilty of murder if the\nwoman died from the attempt.Instead of following these authorities,Roerelied largely on two articles by a pro-abortion\nadvocate who claimed that Coke had intentionally misstated the\ncommon law because of his strong anti-abortion views.[37] These articles have been\ndiscredited,[38] and it has\ncome to light that even members of Jane Roe\u2019s legal team did not\nregard them as serious scholarship. An internal memorandum\ncharacterized this author\u2019s work as donning \u201cthe guise of impartial\nscholarship while advancing the proper ideological goals.\u201d[39] Continued reliance on such\nscholarship is unsupportable.The Solicitor General next suggests that history\nsupports an abortion right because the common law\u2019s failure to\ncriminalize abortion before quickening means that \u201cat the Founding\nand for decades thereafter, women generally could terminate a\npregnancy, at least in its early stages.\u201d[40] Brief for United States 26\u201327; see also Brief for\nRespondents 21. But the insistence on quickening was not universal,\nseeMills, 13 Pa., at 633;Statev.Slagle, 83\nN.\u00a0C. 630, 632 (1880), and regardless, the fact that many\nStates in the late 18th and early 19th century did not criminalize\npre-quickening abortions does not mean that anyone thought the\nStates lacked the authority to do so. When legislatures began to\nexercise that authority as the century wore on, no one, as far as\nwe are aware, argued that the laws they enacted violated a\nfundamental right. That is not surprising since common-law\nauthorities had repeatedly condemned abortion and described it as\nan \u201cunlawful\u201d act without regard to whether it occurred before or\nafter quickening. Seesupra, at 16\u201321.Anotheramicusbrief relied upon by\nrespondents (see Brief for Respondents 21) tries to dismiss the\nsignificance of the state criminal statutes that were in effect\nwhen the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted by suggesting that they\nwere enacted for illegitimate reasons. According to this account,\nwhich is based almost entirely on statements made by one prominent\nproponent of the statutes, important motives for the laws were the\nfear that Catholic immigrants were having more babies than\nProtestants and that the availability of abortion was leading White\nProtestant women to \u201cshir[k their] maternal duties.\u201d Brief for\nAmerican Historical Association et\u00a0al. asAmici Curiae20.Resort to this argument is a testament to the\nlack of any real historical support for the right thatRoeandCaseyrecognized. This Court has long disfavored\narguments based on alleged legislative motives. See,e.g.,Eriev.Pap\u2019s A.\u00a0M.,529\nU.S. 277, 292 (2000) (plurality opinion);Turner\nBroadcasting System, Inc.v.FCC,512 U.S.\n622, 652 (1994);United Statesv.O\u2019Brien,391 U.S.\n367, 383 (1968);Arizonav.California,283 U.S.\n423, 455 (1931) (collecting cases). The Court has recognized\nthat inquiries into legislative motives \u201care a hazardous matter.\u201dO\u2019Brien, 391 U.\u00a0S., at 383. Even when an argument about\nlegislative motive is backed by statements made by legislators who\nvoted for a law, we have been reluctant to attribute those motives\nto the legislative body as a whole. \u201cWhat motivates one legislator\nto make a speech about a statute is not necessarily what motivates\nscores of others to enact it.\u201dId.,at 384.Here, the argument about legislative motive is\nnot even based on statements by legislators, but on statements made\nby a few supporters of the new 19th-century abortion laws, and it\nis quite a leap to attribute these motives to all the legislators\nwhose votes were responsible for the enactment of those laws.\nRecall that at the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth\nAmendment, over three-quarters of the States had adopted statutes\ncriminalizing abortion (usually at all stages of pregnancy), and\nthat from the early 20th century until the dayRoewas\nhanded down, every single State had such a law on its books. Are we\nto believe that the hundreds of lawmakers whose votes were needed\nto enact these laws were motivated by hostility to Catholics and\nwomen?There is ample evidence that the passage of\nthese laws was instead spurred by a sincere belief that abortion\nkills a human being. Many judicial decisions from the late 19th and\nearly 20th centuries made that point. See,e.g.,Nashv.Meyer, 54 Idaho 283, 301, 31 P.2d 273, 280 (1934);Statev.Ausplund, 86 Ore. 121, 131\u2013132, 167 P. 1019,\n1022\u20131023 (1917);Trentv.State, 15 Ala. App. 485,\n488, 73 S. 834, 836 (1916);Statev.Miller, 90 Kan.\n230, 233, 133 P. 878, 879 (1913);Statev.Tippie, 89\nOhio St. 35, 39\u201340, 105 N.E. 75, 77 (1913);Statev.Gedicke, 43 N.\u00a0J.\u00a0L. 86, 90 (1881);Doughertyv.People, 1 Colo. 514, 522\u2013523 (1873);Statev.Moore, 25 Iowa 128, 131\u2013132 (1868);Smith,33 Me., at 57; see alsoMemphis Center for\nReproductive Healthv.Slatery, 14 F. 4th 409, 446, and\nn. 11 (CA6 2021) (Thapar, J., concurring in judgment in part and\ndissenting in part) (citing cases).One may disagree with this belief (and our\ndecision is not based on any view about when a State should regard\nprenatal life as having rights or legally cognizable interests),\nbut evenRoeandCaseydid not question the good\nfaith of abortion opponents. See,e.g.,Casey, 505\nU.\u00a0S., at 850 (\u201cMen and women of good conscience can disagree\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. about the profound moral and spiritual implications\nof terminating a pregnancy even in its earliest stage\u201d). And we see\nno reason to discount the significance of the state laws in\nquestion based on theseamici\u2019s suggestions about\nlegislative motive.[41]C1Instead of seriously pressing the argument\nthat the abortion right itself has deep roots, supporters ofRoeandCaseycontend that the abortion right is an\nintegral part of a broader entrenched right.Roetermed this\na right to privacy, 410 U.\u00a0S., at 154, andCaseydescribed it as the freedom to make \u201cintimate and personal choices\u201d\nthat are \u201ccentral to personal dignity and autonomy,\u201d 505\nU.\u00a0S., at 851.Caseyelaborated: \u201cAt the heart of\nliberty is the right to define one\u2019s own concept of existence, of\nmeaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life.\u201dIbid.The Court did not claim that this broadly framed\nright is absolute, and no such claim would be plausible. While\nindividuals are certainly freetothinkandto\nsaywhat they wish about \u201cexistence,\u201d \u201cmeaning,\u201d the\n\u201cuniverse,\u201d and \u201cthe mystery of human life,\u201d they are not always\nfreeto actin accordance with those thoughts. License to\nact on the basis of such beliefs may correspond to one of the many\nunderstandings of \u201cliberty,\u201d but it is certainly not \u201cordered\nliberty.\u201dOrdered liberty sets limits and defines the\nboundary between competing interests.RoeandCaseyeach struck a particular balance between the interests of a woman\nwho wants an abortion and the interests of what they termed\n\u201cpotential life.\u201dRoe, 410 U.\u00a0S., at 150 (emphasis\ndeleted);Casey, 505 U.\u00a0S., at 852. But the people of\nthe various States may evaluate those interests differently. In\nsome States, voters may believe that the abortion right should be\neven more extensive than the right thatRoeandCaseyrecognized. Voters in other States may wish to impose tight\nrestrictions based on their belief that abortion destroys an\n\u201cunborn human being.\u201d Miss. Code Ann. \u00a741\u201341\u2013191(4)(b). Our\nNation\u2019s historical understanding of ordered liberty does not\nprevent the people\u2019s elected representatives from deciding how\nabortion should be regulated.Nor does the right to obtain an abortion have a\nsound basis in precedent.Caseyrelied on cases involving\nthe right to marry a person of a different race,Lovingv.Virginia,388 U.S. 1(1967); the right to marry while in prison,Turnerv.Safley,482 U.S.\n78(1987); the right to obtain contraceptives,Griswoldv.Connecticut,381 U.S.\n479(1965),Eisenstadtv.Baird,405 U.S.\n438(1972),Careyv.Population Services Int\u2019l,431 U.S.\n678(1977); the right to reside with relatives,Moorev.East Cleveland,431 U.S.\n494(1977); the right to make decisions about the education of\none\u2019s children,Piercev.Society of Sisters,268 U.S.\n510(1925),Meyerv.Nebraska,262 U.S.\n390(1923); the right not to be sterilized without consent,Skinnerv.Oklahoma ex rel.

Harper,494 U.S.\n210(1990),Rochinv.California,342 U.S.\n165(1952). Respondents and the Solicitor General also rely on\npost-Caseydecisions likeLawrencev.Texas,539 U.S.\n558(2003) (right to engage in private, consensual sexual\nacts), andObergefellv.Hodges, 576 U.S. 644 (2015)\n(right to marry a person of the same sex). See Brief for\nRespondents 18; Brief for United States 23\u201324.These attempts to justify abortion through\nappeals to a broader right to autonomy and to define one\u2019s \u201cconcept\nof existence\u201d prove too much.Casey, 505 U.\u00a0S., at 851.\nThose criteria, at a high level of generality, could license\nfundamental rights to illicit drug use, prostitution, and the like.\nSeeCompassion in Dyingv.Washington,85 F.3d 1440, 1444 (CA9 1996) (O\u2019Scannlain, J., dissenting from\ndenial of rehearing en banc). None of these rights has any claim to\nbeing deeply rooted in history.Id., at 1440,\n1445.What sharply distinguishes the abortion right\nfrom the rights recognized in the cases on whichRoeandCaseyrely is something that both those decisions\nacknowledged: Abortion destroys what those decisions call\n\u201cpotential life\u201d and what the law at issue in this case regards as\nthe life of an \u201cunborn human being.\u201d SeeRoe, 410\nU.\u00a0S., at 159 (abortion is \u201cinherently different\u201d);Casey, 505 U.\u00a0S., at 852 (abortion is \u201ca unique act\u201d).\nNone of the other decisions cited byRoeandCaseyinvolved the critical moral question posed by abortion. They are\ntherefore inapposite. They do not support the right to obtain an\nabortion, and by the same token, our conclusion that the\nConstitution does not confer such a right does not undermine them\nin any way.2In drawing this critical distinction between\nthe abortion right and other rights, it is not necessary to disputeCasey\u2019s claim (which we accept for the sake of argument)\nthat \u201cthe specific practices of States at the time of the adoption\nof the Fourteenth Amendment\u201d do not \u201cmar[k] the outer limits of the\nsubstantive sphere of liberty which the Fourteenth Amendment\nprotects.\u201d 505 U.\u00a0S., at 848. Abortion is nothing new. It has\nbeen addressed by lawmakers for centuries, and the fundamental\nmoral question that it poses is ageless.Defenders ofRoeandCaseydo not\nclaim that any new scientific learning calls for a different answer\nto the underlying moral question, but they do contend that changes\nin society require the recognition of a constitutional right to\nobtain an abortion. Without the availability of abortion, they\nmaintain, people will be inhibited from exercising their freedom to\nchoose the types of relationships they desire, and women will be\nunable to compete with men in the workplace and in other\nendeavors.Americans who believe that abortion should be\nrestricted press countervailing arguments about modern\ndevelopments. They note that attitudes about the pregnancy of\nunmarried women have changed drastically; that federal and state\nlaws ban discrimination on the basis of pregnancy;[42] that leave for pregnancy and childbirth\nare now guaranteed by law in many cases;[43] that the costs of medical care associated with\npregnancy are covered by insurance or government\nassistance;[44] that States\nhave increasingly adopted \u201csafe haven\u201d laws, which generally allow\nwomen to drop off babies anonymously;[45] and that a woman who puts her newborn up for adoption\ntoday has little reason to fear that the baby will not find a\nsuitable home.[46] They also\nclaim that many people now have a new appreciation of fetal life\nand that when prospective parents who want to have a child view a\nsonogram, they typically have no doubt that what they see is their\ndaughter or son.Both sides make important policy arguments, but\nsupporters ofRoeandCaseymust show that this Court\nhas the authority to weigh those arguments and decide how abortion\nmay be regulated in the States. They have failed to make that\nshowing, and we thus return the power to weigh those arguments to\nthe people and their elected representatives.D1The dissent is very candid that it cannot show\nthat a constitutional right to abortion has any foundation, let\nalone a \u201c\u00a0\u2018deeply rooted\u2019\u00a0\u201d one, \u201c\u00a0\u2018in this Nation\u2019s\nhistory and tradition.\u2019\u00a0\u201dGlucksberg, 521 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 721; seepost, at 12\u201314 (joint opinion of Breyer,\nSotomayor, and Kagan, JJ.). The dissent does not identifyanypre-Roeauthority that supports such a right\u2014no\nstate constitutional provision or statute, no federal or state\njudicial precedent, not even a scholarly treatise. Comparepost, at 12\u201314, n.\u00a02, withsupra,at 15\u201316, and\nn. 23. Nor does the dissent dispute the fact that abortion was\nillegal at common law at least after quickening; that the 19th\ncentury saw a trend toward criminalization of pre-quickening\nabortions; that by 1868, a supermajority of States (at least 26 of\n37) had enacted statutes criminalizing abortion at all stages of\npregnancy; that by the late 1950s at least 46 States prohibited\nabortion \u201chowever and whenever performed\u201d except if necessary to\nsave \u201cthe life of the mother,\u201dRoe, 410 U.\u00a0S., at 139;\nand that whenRoewas decided in 1973 similar statutes were\nstill in effect in 30 States. Comparepost, at 12\u201314, nn.\n2\u20133, withsupra,at 23\u201325, and nn. 33\u201334.[47]The dissent\u2019s failure to engage with this long\ntradition is devastating to its position. We have held that the\n\u201cestablished method of substantive-due-process analysis\u201d requires\nthat an unenumerated right be \u201c\u00a0\u2018deeply rooted in this\nNation\u2019s history and tradition\u2019\u00a0\u201d before it can be recognized\nas a component of the \u201cliberty\u201d protected in the Due Process\nClause.Glucksberg, 521 U.\u00a0S., at 721; cf.Timbs, 586 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 7). But despite\nthe dissent\u2019s professed fidelity tostare decisis, it fails\nto seriously engage with that important precedent\u2014which it cannot\npossibly satisfy.The dissent attempts to obscure this failure by\nmisrepresenting our application ofGlucksberg.The dissent\nsuggests that we have focused only on \u201cthe legal status of abortion\nin the 19th century,\u201dpost,at 26, but our review of this\nNation\u2019s tradition extends well past that period. As explained, for\nmore than a century after 1868\u2014including \u201canother half-century\u201d\nafter women gained the constitutional right to vote in 1920, seepost, at 15; Amdt. 19\u2014it was firmly established that laws\nprohibiting abortion like the Texas law at issue inRoewere\npermissible exercises of state regulatory authority. And today,\nanother half century later, more than half of the States have asked\nus to overruleRoeandCasey.The dissent cannot\nestablish that a right to abortion haseverbeen part of\nthis Nation\u2019s tradition.2Because the dissent cannot argue that the\nabortion right is rooted in this Nation\u2019s history and tradition, it\ncontends that the \u201cconstitutional tradition\u201d is \u201cnot captured whole\nat a single moment,\u201d and that its \u201cmeaning gains content from the\nlong sweep of our history and from successive judicial precedents.\u201dPost, at 18 (internal quotation marks omitted). This vague\nformulation imposes no clear restraints on what Justice White\ncalled the \u201cexercise of raw judicial power,\u201dRoe, 410\nU.\u00a0S., at 222 (dissenting opinion), and while the dissent\nclaims that its standard \u201cdoes not mean anything goes,\u201dpost, at 17, any real restraints are hard to discern.The largely limitless reach of the dissenters\u2019\nstandard is illustrated by the way they apply it here. First, if\nthe \u201clong sweep of history\u201d imposes any restraint on the\nrecognition of unenumerated rights, thenRoewas surely\nwrong, since abortion was never allowed (except to save the life of\nthe mother) in a majority of States for over 100 years before that\ndecision was handed down. Second, it is impossible to defendRoebased on prior precedent because all of the precedentsRoecited, includingGriswoldandEisenstadt,\nwere critically different for a reason that we have explained: None\nof those cases involved the destruction of whatRoecalled\n\u201cpotential life.\u201d Seesupra, at 32.So without support in history or relevant\nprecedent,Roe\u2019s reasoning cannot be defended even under the\ndissent\u2019s proposed test, and the dissent is forced to rely solely\non the fact that a constitutional right to abortion was recognized\ninRoeand later decisions that acceptedRoe\u2019s\ninterpretation. Under the doctrine ofstare decisis, those\nprecedents are entitled to careful and respectful consideration,\nand we engage in that analysis below. But as the Court has\nreiterated time and time again, adherence to precedent is not\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018an inexorable command.\u2019\u00a0\u201dKimblev.Marvel\nEntertainment, LLC, 576 U.S. 446, 455 (2015). There are\noccasions when past decisions should be overruled, and as we will\nexplain, this is one of them.3The most striking feature of the dissent is\nthe absence of any serious discussion of the legitimacy of the\nStates\u2019 interest in protecting fetal life. This is evident in the\nanalogy that the dissent draws between the abortion right and the\nrights recognized inGriswold(contraception),Eisenstadt(same),Lawrence(sexual conduct with\nmember of the same sex),andObergefell(same-sex\nmarriage). Perhaps this is designed to stoke unfounded fear that\nour decision will imperil those other rights, but the dissent\u2019s\nanalogy is objectionable for a more important reason: what it\nreveals about the dissent\u2019s views on the protection of whatRoecalled \u201cpotential life.\u201d The exercise of the rights at\nissue inGriswold,Eisenstadt,Lawrence, andObergefelldoes not destroy a \u201cpotential life,\u201d but an\nabortion has that effect. So if the rights at issue in those cases\nare fundamentally the same as the right recognized inRoeandCasey, the implication is clear: The Constitution does\nnot permit the States to regard the destruction of a \u201cpotential\nlife\u201d as a matter of any significance.That view is evident throughout the dissent. The\ndissent has much to say about the effects of pregnancy on women,\nthe burdens of motherhood, and the difficulties faced by poor\nwomen. These are important concerns. However, the dissent evinces\nno similar regard for a State\u2019s interest in protecting prenatal\nlife. The dissent repeatedly praises the \u201cbalance,\u201dpost, at\n2, 6, 8, 10, 12, that the viability line strikes between a woman\u2019s\nliberty interest and the State\u2019s interest in prenatal life. But for\nreasons we discuss later, seeinfra,at 50\u201354, 55\u201356, and\ngiven in the opinion of The Chief Justice,post,at 2\u20135\n(opinion concurring in judgment), the viability line makes no\nsense. It was not adequately justified inRoe, and the\ndissent does not even try to defend it today. Nor does it identify\nany other point in a pregnancy after which a State is permitted to\nprohibit the destruction of a fetus.Our opinion is not based on any view about if\nand when prenatal life is entitled to any of the rights enjoyed\nafter birth. The dissent, by contrast, would impose on the people a\nparticular theory about when the rights of personhood begin.\nAccording to the dissent, the Constitutionrequiresthe\nStates to regard a fetus as lacking even the most basic human\nright\u2014to live\u2014at least until an arbitrary point in a pregnancy has\npassed. Nothing in the Constitution or in our Nation\u2019s legal\ntraditions authorizes the Court to adopt that \u201c\u00a0\u2018theory of\nlife.\u2019\u00a0\u201dPost, at 8.IIIWe next consider whether the doctrine ofstare decisiscounsels continued acceptance ofRoeandCasey.Stare decisisplays an important role in\nour case law, and we have explained that it serves many valuable\nends. It protects the interests of those who have taken action in\nreliance on a past decision. SeeCasey, 505 U.\u00a0S., at\n856 (joint opinion); see alsoPaynev.Tennessee,501\nU.S. 808, 828 (1991). It \u201creduces incentives for challenging\nsettled precedents, saving parties and courts the expense of\nendless relitigation.\u201dKimble, 576 U.\u00a0S., at 455. It\nfosters \u201cevenhanded\u201d decisionmaking by requiring that like cases be\ndecided in a like manner.Payne, 501 U.\u00a0S., at 827. It\n\u201ccontributes to the actual and perceived integrity of the judicial\nprocess.\u201dIbid. And it restrains judicial hubris and reminds\nus to respect the judgment of those who have grappled with\nimportant questions in the past. \u201cPrecedent is a way of\naccumulating and passing down the learning of past generations, a\nfont of established wisdom richer than what can be found in any\nsingle judge or panel of judges.\u201d N. Gorsuch, A Republic, If You\nCan Keep It 217 (2019).We have long recognized, however, thatstare\ndecisisis \u201cnot an inexorable command,\u201dPearsonv.Callahan,555 U.S.\n223, 233 (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted), and it \u201cis\nat its weakest when we interpret the Constitution,\u201dAgostiniv.Felton,521\nU.S. 203, 235 (1997). It has been said that it is sometimes\nmore important that an issue \u201c\u00a0\u2018be settled than that it be\nsettled right.\u2019\u00a0\u201dKimble, 576 U.\u00a0S., at 455\n(quotingBurnetv.Coronado Oil & Gas Co.,285 U.S.\n393, 406 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting)). But when it comes\nto the interpretation of the Constitution\u2014the \u201cgreat charter of our\nliberties,\u201d which was meant \u201cto endure through a long lapse of\nages,\u201dMartinv.Hunter\u2019s Lessee,1 Wheat. 304, 326\n(1816) (opinion for the Court by Story, J.)\u2014we place a high value\non having the matter \u201csettled right.\u201d In addition, when one of our\nconstitutional decisions goes astray, the country is usually stuck\nwith the bad decision unless we correct our own mistake. An\nerroneous constitutional decision can be fixed by amending the\nConstitution, but our Constitution is notoriously hard to amend.\nSee Art. V;Kimble, 576 U.\u00a0S., at 456. Therefore, in\nappropriate circumstances we must be willing to reconsider and, if\nnecessary, overrule constitutional decisions.Some of our most important constitutional\ndecisions have overruled prior precedents. We mention three. InBrownv.Board of Education,347\nU.S. 483(1954), the Court repudiated the \u201cseparate but equal\u201d\ndoctrine, which had allowed States to maintain racially segregated\nschools and other facilities.Id., at 488 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). In so doing, the Court overruled the\ninfamous decision inPlessyv.Ferguson,163 U.S.\n537(1896), along with six other Supreme Court precedents that\nhad applied the separate-but-equal rule. SeeBrown, 347\nU.\u00a0S., at 491.InWest Coast Hotel Co.v.Parrish,300 U.S.\n379(1937), the Court overruledAdkinsv.Children\u2019s\nHospital of D. C.,261 U.S.\n525(1923), which had held that a law setting minimum wages for\nwomen violated the \u201cliberty\u201d protected by the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due\nProcess Clause.Id., at 545.West Coast Hotelsignaled the demise of an entire line of important precedents that\nhad protected an individual liberty right against state and federal\nhealth and welfare legislation. SeeLochnerv.New\nYork,198 U.S.\n45(1905) (holding invalid a law setting maximum working\nhours);Coppagev.Kansas,236 U.S.\n1(1915) (holding invalid a law banning contracts forbidding\nemployees to join a union);Jay Burns Baking Co.v.Bryan,264 U.S.\n504(1924) (holding invalid laws fixing the weight of loaves of\nbread).Finally, inWest Virginia Bd. of Ed.v.Barnette,319 U.S.\n624(1943), after the lapse of only three years, the Court\noverruledMinersville School Dist.v.Gobitis,310 U.S.\n586(1940), and held that public school students could not be\ncompelled to salute the flag in violation of their sincere beliefs.Barnettestands out because nothing had changed during the\nintervening period other than the Court\u2019s belated recognition that\nits earlier decision had been seriously wrong.On many other occasions, this Court has\noverruled important constitutional decisions. (We include a partial\nlist in the footnote that follows.[48]) Without these decisions, American constitutional law\nas we know it would be unrecognizable, and this would be a\ndifferent country.No Justice of this Court has ever argued that\nthe Court shouldneveroverrule a constitutional decision,\nbut overruling a precedent is a serious matter. It is not a step\nthat should be taken lightly. Our cases have attempted to provide a\nframework for deciding when a precedent should be overruled, and\nthey have identified factors that should be considered in making\nsuch a decision.Janusv.State, County, and Municipal\nEmployees, 585 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___\u2013___ (2018) (slip op., at\n34\u201335);Ramosv.Louisiana, 590 U.\u00a0S. ___,\n___\u2013___ (2020) (Kavanaugh, J., concurring in part) (slip op., at\n7\u20139).In this case, five factors weigh strongly in\nfavor of overrulingRoeandCasey: the nature of\ntheir error, the quality of their reasoning, the \u201cworkability\u201d of\nthe rules they imposed on the country, their disruptive effect on\nother areas of the law, and the absence of concrete reliance.AThe nature of the Court\u2019s error. An\nerroneous interpretation of the Constitution is always important,\nbut some are more damaging than others.The infamous decision inPlessyv.Ferguson, was one such decision. It betrayed our commitment\nto \u201cequality before the law.\u201d 163 U.\u00a0S., at 562 (Harlan, J.,\ndissenting). It was \u201cegregiously wrong\u201d on the day it was decided,\nseeRamos,590 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (opinion of Kavanaugh, J.)\n(slip op., at 7), and as the Solicitor General agreed at oral\nargument, it should have been overruled at the earliest\nopportunity, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 92\u201393.Roewas also egregiously wrong and deeply\ndamaging. For reasons already explained,Roe\u2019s\nconstitutional analysis was far outside the bounds of any\nreasonable interpretation of the various constitutional provisions\nto which it vaguely pointed.Roewas on a collision course with the\nConstitution from the day it was decided,Caseyperpetuated\nits errors, and those errors do not concern some arcane corner of\nthe law of little importance to the American people. Rather,\nwielding nothing but \u201craw judicial power,\u201dRoe, 410\nU.\u00a0S., at 222 (White, J., dissenting), the Court usurped the\npower to address a question of profound moral and social importance\nthat the Constitution unequivocally leaves for the people.Caseydescribed itself as calling both sides of the national\ncontroversy to resolve their debate, but in doing so,Caseynecessarily declared a winning side. Those on the losing side\u2014those\nwho sought to advance the State\u2019s interest in fetal life\u2014could no\nlonger seek to persuade their elected representatives to adopt\npolicies consistent with their views. The Court short-circuited the\ndemocratic process by closing it to the large number of Americans\nwho dissented in any respect fromRoe. \u201cRoefanned\ninto life an issue that has inflamed our national politics in\ngeneral, and has obscured with its smoke the selection of Justices\nto this Court in particular, ever since.\u201dCasey, 505\nU.\u00a0S., at 995\u2013996 (opinion of Scalia, J.). Together,RoeandCaseyrepresent an error that cannot be\nallowed to stand.As the Court\u2019s landmark decision inWest\nCoast Hotelillustrates, the Court has previously overruled\ndecisions that wrongly removed an issue from the people and the\ndemocratic process. As Justice White later explained, \u201cdecisions\nthat find in the Constitution principles or values that cannot\nfairly be read into that document usurp the people\u2019s authority, for\nsuch decisions represent choices that the people have never made\nand that they cannot disavow through corrective legislation. For\nthis reason, it is essential that this Court maintain the power to\nrestore authority to its proper possessors by correcting\nconstitutional decisions that, on reconsideration, are found to be\nmistaken.\u201dThornburgh, 476 U.\u00a0S., at 787 (dissenting\nopinion).BThe quality of the reasoning. Under our\nprecedents, the quality of the reasoning in a prior case has an\nimportant bearing on whether it should be reconsidered. SeeJanus, 585 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 38);Ramos, 590 U.\u00a0S., at ___\u2013___ (opinion of Kavanaugh, J.)\n(slip op., at 7\u20138). In Part II,supra, we explained whyRoewas incorrectly decided, but that decision was more than\njust wrong. It stood on exceptionally weak grounds.Roefound that the Constitution\nimplicitly conferred a right to obtain an abortion, but it failed\nto ground its decision in text, history, or precedent. It relied on\nan erroneous historical narrative; it devoted great attention to\nand presumably relied on matters that have no bearing on the\nmeaning of the Constitution; it disregarded the fundamental\ndifference between the precedents on which it relied and the\nquestion before the Court; it concocted an elaborate set of rules,\nwith different restrictions for each trimester of pregnancy, but it\ndid not explain how this veritable code could be teased out of\nanything in the Constitution, the history of abortion laws, prior\nprecedent, or any other cited source; and its most important rule\n(that States cannot protect fetal life prior to \u201cviability\u201d) was\nnever raised by any party and has never been plausibly explained.Roe\u2019s reasoning quickly drew scathing scholarly criticism,\neven from supporters of broad access to abortion.TheCaseyplurality, while reaffirmingRoe\u2019s central holding,pointedly refrained from\nendorsing most of its reasoning. It revised the textual basis for\nthe abortion right, silently abandonedRoe\u2019s erroneous\nhistorical narrative, and jettisoned the trimester framework. But\nit replaced that scheme with an arbitrary \u201cundue burden\u201d test and\nrelied on an exceptional version ofstare decisisthat, as\nexplained below, this Court had never before applied and has never\ninvoked since.1aThe weaknesses inRoe\u2019s reasoning are\nwell-known. Without any grounding in the constitutional text,\nhistory, or precedent, it imposed on the entire country a detailed\nset of rules much like those that one might expect to find in a\nstatute or regulation. See 410 U.\u00a0S., at 163\u2013164. Dividing\npregnancy into three trimesters, the Court imposed special rules\nfor each. During the first trimester, the Court announced, \u201cthe\nabortion decision and its effectuation must be left to the medical\njudgment of the pregnant woman\u2019s attending physician.\u201dId.,\nat 164. After that point, a State\u2019s interest in regulating abortion\nfor the sake of a woman\u2019s health became compelling, and\naccordingly, a State could \u201cregulate the abortion procedure in ways\nthat are reasonably related to maternal health.\u201dIbid.\nFinally, in \u201cthe stage subsequent to viability,\u201d which in 1973\nroughly coincided with the beginning of the third trimester, the\nState\u2019s interest in \u201cthe potentiality of human life\u201d became\ncompelling, and therefore a State could \u201cregulate, and even\nproscribe, abortion except where it is necessary, in appropriate\nmedical judgment, for the preservation of the life or health of the\nmother.\u201dId.,at 164\u2013165.This elaborate scheme was the Court\u2019s own\nbrainchild. Neither party advocated the trimester framework; nor\ndid either party or anyamicusargue that \u201cviability\u201d should\nmark the point at which the scope of the abortion right and a\nState\u2019s regulatory authority should be substantially transformed.\nSee Brief for Appellant and Brief for Appellee inRoev.Wade, O. T. 1972, No. 70\u201318; see also C. Forsythe, Abuse of\nDiscretion: The Inside Story ofRoev.Wade127, 141\n(2012).bNot only did this scheme resemble the work of\na legislature, but the Court made little effort to explain how\nthese rules could be deduced from any of the sources on which\nconstitutional decisions are usually based. We have already\ndiscussedRoe\u2019s treatment of constitutional text, and the\nopinion failed to show that history, precedent, or any other cited\nsource supported its scheme.Roefeatured a lengthy survey of history,\nbut much of its discussion was irrelevant, and the Court made no\neffort to explain why it was included. For example, multiple\nparagraphs were devoted to an account of the views and practices of\nancient civilizations where infanticide was widely accepted. See\n410 U.\u00a0S., at 130\u2013132 (discussing ancient Greek and Roman\npractices).[49] When it came\nto the most important historical fact\u2014how the States regulated\nabortion when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted\u2014the Court said\nalmost nothing. It allowed that States had tightened their abortion\nlaws \u201cin the middle and late 19th century,\u201did., at 139, but\nit implied that these laws might have been enacted not to protect\nfetal life but to further \u201ca Victorian social concern\u201d about\n\u201cillicit sexual conduct,\u201did., at 148.Roe\u2019s failure even to note the\noverwhelming consensus of state laws in effect in 1868 is striking,\nand what it said about the common law was simply wrong. Relying on\ntwo discredited articles by an abortion advocate, the Court\nerroneously suggested\u2014contrary to Bracton, Coke, Hale, Blackstone,\nand a wealth of other authority\u2014that the common law had probably\nnever really treated post-quickening abortion as a crime. Seeid., at 136 (\u201c[I]t now appear[s] doubtful that abortion was\never firmly established as a common-law crime even with respect to\nthe destruction of a quick fetus\u201d). This erroneous understanding\nappears to have played an important part in the Court\u2019s thinking\nbecause the opinion cited \u201cthe lenity of the common law\u201d as one of\nthe four factors that informed its decision.Id., at\n165.After surveying history, the opinion spent many\nparagraphs conducting the sort of fact-finding that might be\nundertaken by a legislative committee. This included a lengthy\naccount of the \u201cposition of the American Medical Association\u201d and\n\u201c[t]he position of the American Public Health Association,\u201d as well\nas the vote by the American Bar Association\u2019s House of Delegates in\nFebruary 1972 on proposed abortion legislation.Id., at 141,\n144, 146 (emphasis deleted). Also noted were a British judicial\ndecision handed down in 1939 and a new British abortion law enacted\nin 1967.Id., at 137\u2013138. The Court did not explain why\nthese sources shed light on the meaning of the Constitution, and\nnot one of them adopted or advocated anything like the scheme thatRoeimposed on the country.Finally, after all this, the Court turned to\nprecedent. Citing a broad array of cases, the Court found support\nfor a constitutional \u201cright of personal privacy,\u201did.,at\n152, but it conflated two very different meanings of the term: the\nright to shield information from disclosure and the right to make\nand implement important personal decisions without governmental\ninterference. SeeWhalenv.Roe,429 U.S.\n589, 599\u2013600 (1977). Only the cases involving this second sense\nof the term could have any possible relevance to the abortion\nissue, and some of the cases in that category involved personal\ndecisions that were obviously very, very far afield. SeePierce,268 U.S.\n510(right to send children to religious school);Meyer,262 U.S.\n390(right to have children receive German language\ninstruction).What remained was a handful of cases having\nsomething to do with marriage,Loving,388 U.S. 1(right to marry a person of a different race), or procreation,Skinner,316 U.S.\n535(right not to be sterilized);Griswold,381 U.S.\n479(right of married persons to obtain contraceptives);Eisenstadt,405 U.S.\n438(same, for unmarried persons). But none of these decisions\ninvolved what is distinctive about abortion: its effect on whatRoetermed \u201cpotential life.\u201dWhen the Court summarized the basis for the\nscheme it imposed on the country, it asserted that its rules were\n\u201cconsistent with\u201d the following: (1) \u201cthe relative weights of the\nrespective interests involved,\u201d (2) \u201cthe lessons and examples of\nmedical and legal history,\u201d (3) \u201cthe lenity of the common law,\u201d and\n(4) \u201cthe demands of the profound problems of the present day.\u201dRoe, 410 U.\u00a0S.,at 165. Put aside the second and\nthird factors, which were based on the Court\u2019s flawed account of\nhistory, and what remains are precisely the sort of considerations\nthat legislative bodies often take into account when they draw\nlines that accommodate competing interests. The schemeRoeproducedlookedlike legislation, and the Court provided the\nsort of explanation that might be expected from a legislative\nbody.cWhatRoedid not provide was any cogent\njustification for the lines it drew. Why, for example, does a State\nhave no authority to regulate first trimester abortions for the\npurpose of protecting a woman\u2019s health? The Court\u2019s only\nexplanation was that mortality rates for abortion at that stage\nwere lower than the mortality rates for childbirth.Id., at\n163. But the Court did not explain why mortality rates were the\nonly factor that a State could legitimately consider. Many health\nand safety regulations aim to avoid adverse health consequences\nshort of death. And the Court did not explain why it departed from\nthe normal rule that courts defer to the judgments of legislatures\n\u201cin areas fraught with medical and scientific uncertainties.\u201dMarshallv.United States,414\nU.S. 417, 427 (1974).An even more glaring deficiency wasRoe\u2019s\nfailure to justify the critical distinction it drew between pre-\nand post-viability abortions. Here is the Court\u2019s entire\nexplanation:\u201cWith respect to the State\u2019s important and\nlegitimate interest in potential life, the \u2018compelling\u2019 point is at\nviability. This is so because the fetus then presumably has the\ncapability of meaningful life outside the womb.\u201d 410 U.\u00a0S., at\n163.As Professor Laurence Tribe has written,\n\u201c[c]learly, this mistakes \u2018a definition for a syllogism.\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nTribe 4 (quoting Ely 924). The definition of a \u201cviable\u201d fetus is\none that is capable of surviving outside the womb, but why is this\nthe point at which the State\u2019s interest becomes compelling? If, asRoeheld, a State\u2019s interest in protecting prenatal life is\ncompelling \u201cafter viability,\u201d 410 U.\u00a0S., at 163, why isn\u2019t\nthat interest \u201cequally compelling before viability\u201d?Websterv.Reproductive Health Services,492\nU.S. 490, 519 (1989) (plurality opinion) (quotingThornburgh, 476 U.\u00a0S., at 795 (White, J., dissenting)).Roedid not say, and no explanation is apparent.This arbitrary line has not found much support\namong philosophers and ethicists who have attempted to justify a\nright to abortion. Some have argued that a fetus should not be\nentitled to legal protection until it acquires the characteristics\nthat they regard as defining what it means to be a \u201cperson.\u201d Among\nthe characteristics that have been offered as essential attributes\nof \u201cpersonhood\u201d are sentience, self-awareness, the ability to\nreason, or some combination thereof.[50] By this logic, it would be an open question whether\neven born individuals, including young children or those afflicted\nwith certain developmental or medical conditions, merit protection\nas \u201cpersons.\u201d But even if one takes the view that \u201cpersonhood\u201d\nbegins when a certain attribute or combination of attributes is\nacquired, it is very hard to see why viability should mark the\npoint where \u201cpersonhood\u201d begins.The most obvious problem with any such argument\nis that viability is heavily dependent on factors that have nothing\nto do with the characteristics of a fetus. One is the state of\nneonatal care at a particular point in time. Due to the development\nof new equipment and improved practices, the viability line has\nchanged over the years. In the 19th century, a fetus may not have\nbeen viable until the 32d or 33d week of pregnancy or even\nlater.[51] WhenRoewas decided, viability was gauged at roughly 28 weeks. See 410\nU.\u00a0S., at 160. Today, respondents draw the line at 23 or 24\nweeks. Brief for Respondents 8. So, according toRoe\u2019s\nlogic, States now have a compelling interest in protecting a fetus\nwith a gestational age of, say, 26 weeks, but in 1973 States did\nnot have an interest in protecting an identical fetus. How can that\nbe?Viability also depends on the \u201cquality of the\navailable medical facilities.\u201dColauttiv.Franklin,439\nU.S. 379, 396 (1979). Thus, a 24-week-old fetus may be viable\nif a woman gives birth in a city with hospitals that provide\nadvanced care for very premature babies, but if the woman travels\nto a remote area far from any such hospital, the fetus may no\nlonger be viable. On what ground could the constitutional status of\na fetus depend on the pregnant woman\u2019s location? And if viability\nis meant to mark a line having universal moral significance, can it\nbe that a fetus that is viable in a big city in the United States\nhas a privileged moral status not enjoyed by an identical fetus in\na remote area of a poor country?In addition, as the Court once explained,\nviability is not really a hard-and-fast line.Ibid. A\nphysician determining a particular fetus\u2019s odds of surviving\noutside the womb must consider \u201ca number of variables,\u201d including\n\u201cgestational age,\u201d \u201cfetal weight,\u201d a woman\u2019s \u201cgeneral health and\nnutrition,\u201d the \u201cquality of the available medical facilities,\u201d and\nother factors.Id., at 395\u2013396. It is thus \u201conly with\ndifficulty\u201d that a physician can estimate the \u201cprobability\u201d of a\nparticular fetus\u2019s survival.Id., at 396. And even if each\nfetus\u2019s probability of survival could be ascertained with\ncertainty, settling on a \u201cprobabilit[y] of survival\u201d that should\ncount as \u201cviability\u201d is another matter.Ibid.Is a fetus\nviable with a 10 percent chance of survival? 25 percent? 50\npercent? Can such a judgment be made by a State? And can a State\nspecify a gestational age limit that applies in all cases? Or must\nthese difficult questions be left entirely to the individual\n\u201cattending physician on the particular facts of the case before\nhim\u201d?Id., at 388.The viability line, whichCaseytermedRoe\u2019s central rule, makes no sense, and it is telling that\nother countries almost uniformly eschew such a line.[52] The Court thus asserted raw judicial\npower to impose, as a matter of constitutional law, a uniform\nviability rule that allowed the States less freedom to regulate\nabortion than the majority of western democracies enjoy.dAll in all,Roe\u2019s reasoning was\nexceedingly weak, and academic commentators, including those who\nagreed with the decision as a matter of policy, were unsparing in\ntheir criticism. John Hart Ely famously wrote thatRoewas\n\u201cnot constitutional law and g[ave] almost no sense of an obligation\nto try to be.\u201d Ely 947 (emphasis deleted). Archibald Cox, who\nserved as Solicitor General under President Kennedy, commented thatRoe\u201cread[s] like a set of hospital rules and regulations\u201d\nthat \u201c[n]either historian, layman, nor lawyer will be persuaded\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. are part of .\u00a0.\u00a0. the Constitution.\u201d The\nRole of the Supreme Court in American Government 113\u2013114 (1976).\nLaurence Tribe wrote that \u201ceven if there is a need to divide\npregnancy into several segments with lines that clearly identify\nthe limits of governmental power, \u2018interest-balancing\u2019 of the form\nthe Court pursues fails to justify any of the lines actually\ndrawn.\u201d Tribe 4\u20135. Mark Tushnet termedRoea \u201ctotally\nunreasoned judicial opinion.\u201d Red, White, and Blue: A Critical\nAnalysis of Constitutional Law 54 (1988). See also P. Bobbitt,\nConstitutional Fate 157 (1982); A. Amar, Foreword: The Document and\nthe Doctrine, 114 Harv. L. Rev. 26, 110 (2000).DespiteRoe\u2019s weaknesses, its reach was\nsteadily extended in the years that followed. The Court struck down\nlaws requiring that second-trimester abortions be performed only in\nhospitals,Akronv.Akron Center for Reproductive Health,\nInc.,462\nU.S. 416, 433\u2013439 (1983); that minors obtain parental consent,Planned Parenthood of Central Mo.v.Danforth,428 U.S.\n52, 74 (1976); that women give written consent after being\ninformed of the status of the developing prenatal life and the\nrisks of abortion,Akron, 462 U.\u00a0S., at 442\u2013445; that\nwomen wait 24 hours for an abortion,id., at 449\u2013451; that a\nphysician determine viability in a particular manner,Colautti, 439 U.\u00a0S., at 390\u2013397; that a physician\nperforming a post-viability abortion use the technique most likely\nto preserve the life of the fetus,id.,at 397\u2013401; and that\nfetal remains be treated in a humane and sanitary manner,Akron, 462 U.\u00a0S., at 451\u2013452.Justice White complained that the Court was\nengaging in \u201cunrestrained imposition of its own extraconstitutional\nvalue preferences.\u201dThornburgh, 476 U.\u00a0S., at 794\n(dissenting opinion). And the United States asamicus curiaeasked the Court to overruleRoefive times in the decade\nbeforeCasey, see 505 U.\u00a0S., at 844 (joint opinion),\nand then asked the Court to overrule it once more inCaseyitself.2WhenCaseyrevisitedRoealmost\n20 years later, very little ofRoe\u2019s reasoning was defended\nor preserved. The Court abandoned any reliance on a privacy right\nand instead grounded the abortion right entirely on the Fourteenth\nAmendment\u2019s Due Process Clause. 505 U.\u00a0S., at 846. The Court\ndid not reaffirmRoe\u2019s erroneous account of abortion\nhistory. In fact, none of the Justices in the majority said\nanything about the history of the abortion right.And as for\nprecedent, the Court relied on essentially the same body of cases\nthatRoehad cited. Thus, with respect to the standard\ngrounds for constitutional decisionmaking\u2014text, history, and\nprecedent\u2014Caseydid not attempt to bolsterRoe\u2019s\nreasoning.The Court also made no real effort to remedy one\nof the greatest weaknesses inRoe\u2019s analysis: its\nmuch-criticized discussion of viability. The Court retained what it\ncalledRoe\u2019s \u201ccentral holding\u201d\u2014that a State may not regulate\npre-viability abortions for the purpose of protecting fetal\nlife\u2014but it provided no principled defense of the viability line.\n505 U.\u00a0S.,at 860, 870\u2013871. Instead, it merely\nrephrased whatRoehad said, stating that viability marked\nthe point at which \u201cthe independent existence of a second life can\nin reason and fairness be the object of state protection that now\noverrides the rights of the woman.\u201d 505 U.\u00a0S., at 870. Why\n\u201creason and fairness\u201d demanded that the line be drawn at viability\nthe Court did not explain. And the Justices who authored the\ncontrolling opinion conspicuously failed to say that they agreed\nwith the viability rule; instead, they candidly acknowledged \u201cthe\nreservations [some] of us may have in reaffirming [that] holding ofRoe.\u201dId., at 853.The controlling opinion criticized and rejectedRoe\u2019s trimester scheme, 505 U.\u00a0S., at 872, and\nsubstituted a new \u201cundue burden\u201d test, but the basis for this test\nwas obscure. And as we will explain, the test is full of\nambiguities and is difficult to apply.Casey, in short, either refused to\nreaffirm or rejected important aspects ofRoe\u2019s analysis,\nfailed to remedy glaring deficiencies inRoe\u2019s reasoning,\nendorsed what it termedRoe\u2019s central holding while\nsuggesting that a majority might not have thought it was correct,\nprovided no new support for the abortion right other thanRoe\u2019s status as precedent, and imposed a new and problematic\ntest with no firm grounding in constitutional text, history, or\nprecedent.As discussed below,Caseyalso deployed a\nnovel version of the doctrine ofstare decisis. Seeinfra, at 64\u201369. This new doctrine did not account for the\nprofound wrongness of the decision inRoe, and placed great\nweight on an intangible form of reliance with little if any basis\nin prior case law.Stare decisisdoes not command the\npreservation of such a decision.CWorkability. Our precedents counsel\nthat another important consideration in deciding whether a\nprecedent should be overruled is whether the rule it imposes is\nworkable\u2014that is, whether it can be understood and applied in a\nconsistent and predictable manner.Montejov.Louisiana,556\nU.S. 778, 792 (2009);Pattersonv.McLean Credit\nUnion,491 U.S.\n164, 173 (1989);Gulfstream Aerospace Corp.v.Mayacamas Corp.,485 U.S.\n271, 283\u2013284 (1988).Casey\u2019s \u201cundue burden\u201d test has\nscored poorly on the workability scale.1Problems begin with the very concept of an\n\u201cundue burden.\u201d As Justice Scalia noted in hisCaseypartial\ndissent, determining whether a burden is \u201cdue\u201d or \u201cundue\u201d is\n\u201cinherently standardless.\u201d 505 U.\u00a0S., at 992; see alsoJune\nMedical Services L. L. C.v.Russo, 591 U.\u00a0S. ___,\n___ (2020) (Gorsuch, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 17) (\u201c[W]hether\na burden is deemed undue depends heavily on which factors the judge\nconsiders and how much weight he accords each of them\u201d (internal\nquotation marks and alterations omitted)).TheCaseyplurality tried to put meaning\ninto the \u201cundue burden\u201d test by setting out three subsidiary rules,\nbut these rules created their own problems. The first rule is that\n\u201ca provision of law is invalid, if its purpose or effect is to\nplace asubstantial obstaclein the path of a woman seeking\nan abortion before the fetus attains viability.\u201d 505 U.\u00a0S., at\n878 (emphasis added); see alsoid., at 877. But whether a\nparticular obstacle qualifies as \u201csubstantial\u201d is often open to\nreasonable debate. In the sense relevant here, \u201csubstantial\u201d means\n\u201cof ample or considerable amount, quantity, or size.\u201d Random House\nWebster\u2019s Unabridged Dictionary 1897 (2d ed. 2001). Huge burdens\nare plainly \u201csubstantial,\u201d and trivial ones are not, but in between\nthese extremes, there is a wide gray area.This ambiguity is a problem, and the second\nrule, which applies at all stages of a pregnancy, muddies things\nfurther. It states that measures designed \u201cto ensure that the\nwoman\u2019s choice is informed\u201d are constitutional so long as they do\nnot impose \u201can undue burden on the right.\u201dCasey, 505\nU.\u00a0S., at 878. To the extent that this rule applies to\npre-viability abortions, it overlaps with the first rule and\nappears to impose a different standard. Consider a law that imposes\nan insubstantial obstacle but serves little purpose. As applied to\na pre-viability abortion, would such a regulation be constitutional\non the ground that it does not impose a \u201csubstantialobstacle\u201d? Or would it be unconstitutional on the ground that it\ncreates an \u201cundueburden\u201d because the burden it imposes,\nthough slight, outweighs its negligible benefits?Caseydoes\nnot say, and this ambiguity would lead to confusion down the line.\nCompareJune Medical, 591 U.\u00a0S., at ___\u2013___ (plurality\nopinion) (slip op., at 1\u20132), withid.,at ___\u2013___ (Roberts,\nC.\u00a0J., concurring) (slip op., at 5\u20136).The third rule complicates the picture even\nmore. Under that rule,\u201c[u]nnecessary healthregulations\nthat have the purpose or effect of presenting asubstantial\nobstacleto a woman seeking an abortion impose anundue\nburdenon the right.\u201dCasey, 505 U.\u00a0S., at 878\n(emphasis added). This rule contains no fewer than three vague\nterms. It includes the two already discussed\u2014\u201cundue burden\u201d and\n\u201csubstantial obstacle\u201d\u2014even though they are inconsistent. And it\nadds a third ambiguous term when it refers to \u201cunnecessaryhealth regulations.\u201d The term \u201cnecessary\u201d has a range of\nmeanings\u2014from \u201cessential\u201d to merely \u201cuseful.\u201d See Black\u2019s Law\nDictionary 928 (5th ed. 1979); American Heritage Dictionary of the\nEnglish Language 877 (1971).Caseydid not explain the sense\nin which the term is used in this rule.In addition to these problems, one more applies\nto all three rules. They all call on courts to examine a law\u2019s\neffect on women, but a regulation may have a very different impact\non different women for a variety of reasons, including their places\nof residence, financial resources, family situations, work and\npersonal obligations, knowledge about fetal development and\nabortion, psychological and emotional disposition and condition,\nand the firmness of their desire to obtain abortions. In order to\ndetermine whether a regulation presents a substantial obstacle to\nwomen, a court needs to know which set of women it should have in\nmind and how many of the women in this set must find that an\nobstacle is \u201csubstantial.\u201dCaseyprovided no clear answer to these\nquestions. It said that a regulation is unconstitutional if it\nimposes a substantial obstacle \u201cin a large fraction of cases in\nwhich [it] is relevant,\u201d 505 U.\u00a0S., at 895, but there is\nobviously no clear line between a fraction that is \u201clarge\u201d and one\nthat is not. Nor is it clear what the Court meant by \u201ccases in\nwhich\u201d a regulation is \u201crelevant.\u201d These ambiguities have caused\nconfusion and disagreement. CompareWhole Woman\u2019s Healthv.Hellerstedt, 579 U.S. 582, 627\u2013628 (2016), withid.,at 666\u2013667, and n. 11 (Alito, J., dissenting).2The difficulty of applyingCasey\u2019s new\nrules surfaced in that very case. The controlling opinion found\nthat Pennsylvania\u2019s 24-hour waiting period requirement and its\ninformed-consent provision did not impose \u201cundue burden[s],\u201dCasey, 505 U.\u00a0S., at 881\u2013887, but Justice Stevens,\napplying the same test, reached the opposite result,id.,at\n920\u2013922 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part). That\ndid not bode well, and then-Chief Justice Rehnquist aptly observed\nthat \u201cthe undue burden standard presents nothing more workable than\nthe trimester framework.\u201dId., at 964\u2013966 (dissenting\nopinion).The ambiguity of the \u201cundue burden\u201d test also\nproduced disagreement in later cases. InWhole Woman\u2019s\nHealth, the Court adopted the cost-benefit interpretation of\nthe test, stating that \u201c[t]he rule announced inCasey.\u00a0.\u00a0. requires that courts consider the burdens a law\nimposes on abortion accesstogether with the benefits those laws\nconfer.\u201d 579 U.\u00a0S., at 607 (emphasis added). But five\nyears later, a majority of the Justices rejected that\ninterpretation. SeeJune Medical, 591 U.\u00a0S. ___. Four\nJustices reaffirmedWhole Woman\u2019s Health\u2019s instruction to\n\u201cweigh\u201d a law\u2019s \u201cbenefits\u201d against \u201cthe burdens it imposes on\nabortion access.\u201d 591 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (plurality opinion) (slip\nop., at 2) (internal quotation marks omitted). But The Chief\nJustice\u2014who cast the deciding vote\u2014argued that \u201c[n]othing aboutCaseysuggested that a weighing of costs and benefits of an\nabortion regulation was a job for the courts.\u201dId.,at ___\n(opinion concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 6). And the four\nJustices in dissent rejected the plurality\u2019s interpretation ofCasey. See 591 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (opinion of Alito, J.,\njoined in relevant part by Thomas, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh, JJ.)\n(slip op., at 4);id.,at ___\u2013___ (opinion of Gorsuch, J.)\n(slip op., at 15\u201318);id., at ___\u2013___ (opinion of Kavanaugh,\nJ.)

SeeRamos, 590 U.\u00a0S.,\nat ___ (opinion of Kavanaugh, J.) (slip op., at 15);Janus,\n585 U.\u00a0S., at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 34\u201335).1Traditional reliance interests arise \u201cwhere\nadvance planning of great precision is most obviously a necessity.\u201dCasey, 505 U.\u00a0S., at 856 (joint opinion); see alsoPayne, 501 U.\u00a0S., at 828. InCasey, the\ncontrolling opinion conceded that those traditional reliance\ninterests were not implicated because getting an abortion is\ngenerally \u201cunplanned activity,\u201d and \u201creproductive planning could\ntake virtually immediate account of any sudden restoration of state\nauthority to ban abortions.\u201d 505 U.\u00a0S., at 856. For these\nreasons, we agree with theCaseyplurality that\nconventional, concrete reliance interests are not present here.2Unable to find reliance in the conventional\nsense, the controlling opinion inCaseyperceived a more\nintangible form of reliance. It wrote that \u201cpeople [had] organized\nintimate relationships and made choices that define their views of\nthemselves and their places in society .\u00a0.\u00a0. in reliance\non the availability of abortion in the event that contraception\nshould fail\u201d and that \u201c[t]he ability of women to participate\nequally in the economic and social life of the Nation has been\nfacilitated by their ability to control their reproductive lives.\u201dIbid.But this Court is ill-equipped to assess \u201cgeneralized\nassertions about the national psyche.\u201dId., at 957 (opinion\nof Rehnquist, C.\u00a0J.).Casey\u2019s notion of reliance thus\nfinds little support in our cases, which instead emphasize very\nconcrete reliance interests, like those that develop in \u201ccases\ninvolving property and contract rights.\u201dPayne, 501\nU.\u00a0S., at 828.When a concrete reliance interest is asserted,\ncourts are equipped to evaluate the claim, but assessing the novel\nand intangible form of reliance endorsed by theCaseyplurality is another matter. That form of reliance depends on an\nempirical question that is hard for anyone\u2014and in particular, for a\ncourt\u2014to assess, namely, the effect of the abortion right on\nsociety and in particular on the lives of women. The contending\nsides in this case make impassioned and conflicting arguments about\nthe effects of the abortion right on the lives of women. Compare\nBrief for Petitioners 34\u201336; Brief for Women Scholars et al. asAmici Curiae13\u201320, 29\u201341, with Brief for Respondents 36\u201341;\nBrief for National Women\u2019s Law Center et al. asAmici Curiae15\u201332. The contending sides also make conflicting arguments about\nthe status of the fetus. This Court has neither the authority nor\nthe expertise to adjudicate those disputes, and theCaseyplurality\u2019s speculations and weighing of the relative importance of\nthe fetus and mother represent a departure from the \u201coriginal\nconstitutional proposition\u201d that \u201ccourts do not substitute their\nsocial and economic beliefs for the judgment of legislative\nbodies.\u201dFergusonv.Skrupa,372\nU.S. 726, 729\u2013730 (1963).Our decision returns the issue of abortion to\nthose legislative bodies, and it allows women on both sides of the\nabortion issue to seek to affect the legislative process by\ninfluencing public opinion, lobbying legislators, voting, and\nrunning for office. Women are not without electoral or political\npower. It is noteworthy that the percentage of women who register\nto vote and cast ballots is consistently higher than the percentage\nof men who do so.[66] In the\nlast election in November 2020, women, who make up around 51.5\npercent of the population of Mississippi,[67] constituted 55.5 percent of the voters who cast\nballots.[68]3Unable to show concrete reliance onRoeandCaseythemselves, the Solicitor General suggests that\noverruling those decisions would \u201cthreaten the Court\u2019s precedents\nholding that the Due Process Clause protects other rights.\u201d Brief\nfor United States 26 (citingObergefell, 576 U.S. 644;Lawrence,539 U.S.\n558;Griswold, 381 U.\u00a0S. 479). That is not correct\nfor reasons we have already discussed. As even theCaseyplurality recognized, \u201c[a]bortion is a unique act\u201d because it\nterminates \u201clife or potential life.\u201d 505 U.\u00a0S., at 852; see\nalsoRoe, 410 U.\u00a0S., at 159 (abortion is \u201cinherently\ndifferent from marital intimacy,\u201d \u201cmarriage,\u201d or \u201cprocreation\u201d).\nAnd to ensure that our decision is not misunderstood or\nmischaracterized, we emphasize that our decision concerns the\nconstitutional right to abortion and no other right. Nothing in\nthis opinion should be understood to cast doubt on precedents that\ndo not concern abortion.IVHaving shown that traditionalstare\ndecisisfactors do not weigh in favor of retainingRoeorCasey, we must address one final argument that featured\nprominently in theCaseyplurality opinion.The argument was cast in different terms, but\nstated simply, it was essentially as follows. The American people\u2019s\nbelief in the rule of law would be shaken if they lost respect for\nthis Court as an institution that decides important cases based on\nprinciple, not \u201csocial and political pressures.\u201d 505 U.\u00a0S., at\n865.There is a special danger that the public will perceive\na decision as having been made for unprincipled reasons when the\nCourt overrules a controversial \u201cwatershed\u201d decision, such asRoe. 505 U.\u00a0S., at 866\u2013867. A decision overrulingRoewould be perceived as having been made \u201cunder fire\u201d and\nas a \u201csurrender to political pressure,\u201d 505 U.\u00a0S., at 867, and\ntherefore the preservation of public approval of the Court weighs\nheavily in favor of retainingRoe, see 505 U.\u00a0S., at\n869.This analysis starts out on the right foot but\nultimately veers off course. TheCaseyplurality was\ncertainly right that it is important for the public to perceive\nthat our decisions are based on principle, and we should make every\neffort to achieve that objective by issuing opinions that carefully\nshow how a proper understanding of the law leads to the results we\nreach. But we cannot exceed the scope of our authority under the\nConstitution, and we cannot allow our decisions to be affected by\nany extraneous influences such as concern about the public\u2019s\nreaction to our work. Cf.Texasv.Johnson,491 U.S.\n397(1989);Brown,347\nU.S. 483. That is true both when we initially decide a\nconstitutional issueandwhen we consider whether to\noverrule a prior decision. As Chief Justice Rehnquist explained,\n\u201cThe Judicial Branch derives its legitimacy, not from following\npublic opinion, but from deciding by its best lights whether\nlegislative enactments of the popular branches of Government\ncomport with the Constitution. The doctrine ofstare decisisis an adjunct of this duty, and should be no more subject to the\nvagaries of public opinion than is the basic judicial task.\u201dCasey, 505 U.\u00a0S., at 963 (opinion concurring in\njudgment in part and dissenting in part). In suggesting otherwise,\ntheCaseyplurality went beyond this Court\u2019s role in our\nconstitutional system.TheCaseyplurality \u201ccall[ed] the\ncontending sides of a national controversy to end their national\ndivision,\u201d and claimed the authority to impose a permanent\nsettlement of the issue of a constitutional abortion right simply\nby saying that the matter was closed.Id.,at 867. That\nunprecedented claim exceeded the power vested in us by the\nConstitution. As Alexander Hamilton famously put it, the\nConstitution gives the judiciary \u201cneither Force nor Will.\u201d The\nFederalist No. 78, p. 523 (J. Cooke ed. 1961). Our sole authority\nis to exercise \u201cjudgment\u201d\u2014which is to say, the authority to judge\nwhat the law means and how it should apply to the case at hand.Ibid.The Court has no authority to decree that an erroneous\nprecedent ispermanentlyexempt from evaluation under\ntraditionalstare decisisprinciples. A precedent of this\nCourt is subject to the usual principles ofstare decisisunder which adherence to precedent is the norm but not an\ninexorable command. If the rule were otherwise, erroneous decisions\nlikePlessyandLochnerwould still be the law. That\nis not howstare decisisoperates.TheCaseyplurality also misjudged the\npractical limits of this Court\u2019s influence.Roecertainly\ndid not succeed in ending division on the issue of abortion. On the\ncontrary,Roe\u201cinflamed\u201d a national issue that has remained\nbitterly divisive for the past half century.Casey, 505\nU.\u00a0S., at 995 (opinion of Scalia, J.); see also R. Ginsburg,\nSpeaking in a Judicial Voice, 67 N.\u00a0Y. U. L.\u00a0Rev. 1185,\n1208 (1992) (Roemay have \u201chalted a political process,\u201d\n\u201cprolonged divisiveness,\u201d and \u201cdeferred stable settlement of the\nissue\u201d). And for the past 30 years,Caseyhas done the\nsame.Neither decision has ended debate over the issue\nof a constitutional right to obtain an abortion. Indeed, in this\ncase, 26 States expressly ask us to overruleRoeandCaseyand to return the issue of abortion to the people and\ntheir elected representatives. This Court\u2019s inability to end debate\non the issue should not have been surprising. This Court cannot\nbring about the permanent resolution of a rancorous national\ncontroversy simply by dictating a settlement and telling the people\nto move on. Whatever influence the Court may have on public\nattitudes must stem from the strength of our opinions, not an\nattempt to exercise \u201craw judicial power.\u201dRoe, 410\nU.\u00a0S., at 222 (White, J., dissenting).We do not pretend to know how our political\nsystem or society will respond to today\u2019s decision overrulingRoeandCasey. And even if we could foresee what will\nhappen, we would have no authority to let that knowledge influence\nour decision. We can only do our job, which is to interpret the\nlaw, apply longstanding principles ofstare decisis, and\ndecide this case accordingly.We therefore hold that the Constitution does not\nconfer a right to abortion.RoeandCaseymust be\noverruled, and the authority to regulate abortion must be returned\nto the people and their elected representatives.VA1The dissent argues that we have \u201cabandon[ed]\u201dstare decisis,post,at 30, but we have done no such\nthing, and it is the dissent\u2019s understanding ofstare\ndecisisthat breaks with tradition. The dissent\u2019s foundational\ncontention is that the Court should never (or perhaps almost never)\noverrule an egregiously wrong constitutional precedent unless the\nCourt can \u201cpoin[t] to major legal or factual changes undermining\n[the] decision\u2019s original basis.\u201dPost, at 37. To support\nthis contention, the dissent claims thatBrownv.Board\nof Education,347\nU.S. 483, and other landmark cases overruling prior precedents\n\u201cresponded to changed law and to changed facts and attitudes that\nhad taken hold throughout society.\u201dPost,at 43. The\nunmistakable implication of this argument is that only the passage\nof time and new developments justified those decisions. Recognition\nthat the cases they overruled were egregiously wrong on the day\nthey were handed down was not enough.The Court has never adopted this strange new\nversion ofstare decisis\u2014and with good reason. Does the\ndissent really maintain that overrulingPlessywas not\njustified until the country had experienced more than a\nhalf-century of state-sanctioned segregation and generations of\nBlack school children had suffered all its effects?Post,at\n44\u201345.Here is another example. On the dissent\u2019s view,\nit must have been wrong forWest Virginia Bd. of Ed.v.Barnette,319 U.S.\n624, to overruleMinersville School Dist.v.\nGobitis,310 U.S.\n586, a bare three years after it was handed down. In both\ncases, children who were Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses refused on religious\ngrounds to salute the flag or recite the pledge of allegiance. TheBarnetteCourt did not claim that its reexamination of the\nissue was prompted by any intervening legal or factual\ndevelopments, so if the Court had followed the dissent\u2019s new\nversion ofstare decisis,it would have been compelled to\nadhere toGobitisand countenance continued First Amendment\nviolations for some unspecified period.Precedents should be respected, but sometimes\nthe Court errs, and occasionally the Court issues an important\ndecision that is egregiously wrong. When that happens,stare\ndecisisis not a straitjacket. And indeed, the dissent\neventually admits that a decisioncould\u201cbe overruled just\nbecause it is terribly wrong,\u201d though the dissent does not explain\nwhen that would be so.Post, at 45.2Even if the dissent were correct in arguing\nthat an egregiously wrong decision should (almost) never be\noverruled unless its mistake is later highlighted by \u201cmajor legal\nor factual changes,\u201d reexamination ofRoeandCaseywould be amply justified. We have already mentioned a number of\npost-Caseydevelopments, seesupra, at 33\u201334, 59\u201363,\nbut the most profound change may be the failure of theCaseyplurality\u2019s call for \u201cthe contending sides\u201d in the controversy\nabout abortion \u201cto end their national division,\u201d 505 U.\u00a0S., at\n867. That has not happened, and there is no reason to think that\nanother decision sticking withRoewould achieve whatCaseycould not.The dissent, however, is undeterred. It contends\nthat the \u201cvery controversy surroundingRoeandCasey\u201d\nis an importantstare decisisconsideration that requires\nupholding those precedents. Seepost,at 55\u201357. The dissent\ncharacterizesCaseyas a \u201cprecedent about precedent\u201d that is\npermanently shielded from further evaluation under traditionalstare decisisprinciples. Seepost,at 57. But as we\nhave explained,Caseybroke new ground when it treated the\nnational controversy provoked byRoeas a ground for\nrefusing to reconsider that decision, and no subsequent case has\nrelied on that factor. Our decision today simply applies\nlongstandingstare decisisfactors instead of applying a\nversion of the doctrine that seems to apply only in abortion\ncases.3Finally, the dissent suggests that our\ndecision calls into questionGriswold,Eisenstadt,Lawrence, andObergefell.Post, at 4\u20135, 26\u201327,\nn. 8. But we have stated unequivocally that \u201c[n]othing in this\nopinion should be understood to cast doubt on precedents that do\nnot concern abortion.\u201dSupra, at 66. We have also explained\nwhy that is so: rights regarding contraception and same-sex\nrelationships are inherently different from the right to abortion\nbecause the latter (as we have stressed) uniquely involves whatRoeandCaseytermed \u201cpotential life.\u201dRoe,\n410 U.\u00a0S., at 150 (emphasis deleted);Casey, 505\nU.\u00a0S., at 852. Therefore, a right to abortion cannot be\njustified by a purported analogy to the rights recognized in those\nother cases or by \u201cappeals to a broader right to autonomy.\u201dSupra, at 32. It is hard to see how we could be clearer.\nMoreover, even putting aside that these cases are distinguishable,\nthere is a further point that the dissent ignores: Each precedent\nis subject to its ownstare decisisanalysis, and the\nfactors that our doctrine instructs us to consider like reliance\nand workability are different for these cases than for our abortion\njurisprudence.B1We now turn to the concurrence in the\njudgment, which reproves us for deciding whetherRoeandCaseyshould be retained or overruled. That opinion (which\nfor convenience we will call simply \u201cthe concurrence\u201d) recommends a\n\u201cmore measured course,\u201d which it defends based on what it claims is\n\u201ca straightforwardstare decisisanalysis.\u201dPost, at\n1 (opinion of Roberts, C.\u00a0J.). The concurrence would \u201cleave\nfor another day whether to reject any right to an abortion at all,\u201dpost, at 7, and would hold only that if the Constitution\nprotects any such right, the right ends once women have had \u201ca\nreasonable opportunity\u201d to obtain an abortion,post, at 1.\nThe concurrence does not specify what period of time is sufficient\nto provide such an opportunity, but it would hold that 15 weeks,\nthe period allowed under Mississippi\u2019s law, is enough\u2014at least\n\u201cabsent rare circumstances.\u201dPost, at 2, 10.There are serious problems with this approach,\nand it is revealing that nothing like it was recommended by either\nparty. As we have recounted, both parties and the Solicitor General\nhave urged us either to reaffirm or overruleRoeandCasey. Seesupra, at 4\u20135. And when the specific\napproach advanced by the concurrence was broached at oral argument,\nboth respondents and the Solicitor General emphatically rejected\nit. Respondents\u2019 counsel termed it \u201ccompletely unworkable\u201d and\n\u201cless principled and less workable than viability.\u201d Tr. of Oral\nArg. 54. The Solicitor General argued that abandoning the viability\nline would leave courts and others with \u201cno continued guidance.\u201dId., at 101. What is more, the concurrence has not\nidentified any of the more than 130amicusbriefs filed in\nthis case that advocated its approach. The concurrence would do\nexactly what it criticizesRoefor doing: pulling \u201cout of\nthin air\u201d a test that \u201c[n]o party oramicusasked the Court\nto adopt.\u201dPost, at 3.2The concurrence\u2019s most fundamental defect is\nits failure to offer any principled basis for its approach. The\nconcurrence would \u201cdiscar[d]\u201d \u201cthe rule fromRoeandCaseythat a woman\u2019s right to terminate her pregnancy\nextends up to the point that the fetus is regarded as \u2018viable\u2019\noutside the womb.\u201dPost, at 2. But this rule was a critical\ncomponent of the holdings inRoeandCasey, andstare decisisis \u201ca doctrine of preservation, not\ntransformation,\u201dCitizens Unitedv.Federal Election\nComm\u2019n,558\nU.S. 310, 384 (2010) (Roberts, C.\u00a0J., concurring).\nTherefore, a new rule that discards the viability rule cannot be\ndefended onstare decisisgrounds.The concurrence concedes that its approach would\n\u201cnot be available\u201d if \u201cthe rationale ofRoeandCaseywere inextricably entangled with and dependent upon the viability\nstandard.\u201dPost, at 7. But the concurrence asserts that the\nviability line is separable from the constitutional right they\nrecognized, and can therefore be \u201cdiscarded\u201d without disturbing any\npast precedent.Post, at 7\u20138. That is simply incorrect.Roe\u2019s trimester rule was expressly tied\nto viability, see 410 U.\u00a0S., at 163\u2013164, and viability played\na critical role in later abortion decisions. For example, inPlanned Parenthood of Central Mo. v.Danforth,428 U.S.\n52, the Court reiteratedRoe\u2019s rule that a \u201cState may\nregulate an abortion to protect the life of the fetus and even may\nproscribe abortion\u201d at \u201cthe stagesubsequent to viability.\u201d\n428 U.\u00a0S., at 61 (emphasis added). The Court then rejected a\nchallenge to Missouri\u2019s definition of viability, holding that the\nState\u2019s definition was consistent withRoe\u2019s. 428\nU.\u00a0S., at 63\u201364. If viability was not an essential part of the\nrule adopted inRoe, the Court would have had no need to\nmake that comparison.The holding inColauttiv.Franklin,439 U.S.\n379, is even more instructive. In that case, the Court noted\nthat prior cases had \u201cstressed viability\u201d and reiterated that\n\u201c[v]iability is the critical point\u201d underRoe.439\nU.\u00a0S., at 388\u2013389. It then struck down Pennsylvania\u2019s\ndefinition of viability,id., at 389\u2013394, and it is hard to\nsee how the Court could have done that ifRoe\u2019s discussion\nof viability was not part of its holding.When the Court reconsideredRoeinCasey, it left no doubt about the importance of the\nviability rule. It described the rule asRoe\u2019s \u201ccentral\nholding,\u201d 505 U.\u00a0S., at 860, and repeatedly stated that the\nright it reaffirmed was \u201cthe right of the woman to choose to have\nan abortionbefore viability.\u201dId., at 846 (emphasis\nadded). Seeid., at 871 (\u201cThe woman\u2019s right to terminate her\npregnancybefore viabilityis the most central principle ofRoev.Wade. It is a rule of law and a component of\nliberty we cannot renounce\u201d (emphasis added));id., at 872\n(A \u201cwoman has a right to choose to terminate or continue her\npregnancybefore viability\u201d (emphasis added));id.,\nat 879 (\u201c[A] State may not prohibit any woman from making the\nultimate decision to terminate her pregnancybefore\nviability\u201d (emphasis added)).Our subsequent cases have continued to recognize\nthe centrality of the viability rule. SeeWhole Women\u2019s\nHealth, 579 U.\u00a0S., at 589\u2013590 (\u201c[A] provision of law is\nconstitutionally invalid, if the \u2018purpose or effect\u2019 of the\nprovision \u2018is to place a substantial obstacle in the path of a\nwoman seeking an abortionbefore the fetus attains\nviability\u2019\u00a0\u201d (emphasis deleted and added));id., at\n627 (\u201c[W]e now use\u2018viability\u2019as the relevant point at\nwhich a State may begin limiting women\u2019s access to abortion for\nreasons unrelated to maternal health\u201d (emphasis added)).Not only is the new rule proposed by the\nconcurrence inconsistent withCasey\u2019s unambiguous\n\u201clanguage,\u201dpost, at 8, it is also contrary to the judgment\nin that case and later abortion cases. InCasey, the Court\nheld that Pennsylvania\u2019s spousal-notification provision was\nfacially unconstitutional, not just that it was unconstitutional as\napplied to abortions sought prior to the time when a woman has had\na reasonable opportunity to choose. See 505 U.\u00a0S., at 887\u2013898.\nThe same is true ofWhole Women\u2019s Health, which held that\ncertain rules that required physicians performing abortions to have\nadmitting privileges at a nearby hospital were facially\nunconstitutional because they placed \u201ca substantial obstacle in the\npath of women seekinga previability abortion.\u201d 579\nU.\u00a0S., at 591 (emphasis added).For all these reasons,stare decisiscannot justify the new \u201creasonable opportunity\u201d rule propounded by\nthe concurrence. If that rule is to become the law of the land, it\nmust stand on its own, but the concurrence makes no attempt to show\nthat this rule represents a correct interpretation of the\nConstitution. The concurrence does not claim that the right to a\nreasonable opportunity to obtain an abortion is \u201c\u00a0\u2018deeply\nrooted in this Nation\u2019s history and tradition\u2019\u00a0\u201d and\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.\u2019\u00a0\u201dGlucksberg, 521 U.\u00a0S., at 720\u2013721. Nor does it propound\nany other theory that could show that the Constitution supports its\nnew rule. And if the Constitution protects a woman\u2019s right to\nobtain an abortion, the opinion does not explain why that right\nshould end after the point at which all \u201creasonable\u201d women will\nhave decided whether to seek an abortion. While the concurrence is\nmoved by a desire for judicial minimalism, \u201cwe cannot embrace a\nnarrow ground of decision simply because it is narrow; it must also\nbe right.\u201dCitizens United, 558 U.\u00a0S., at 375 (Roberts,\nC.\u00a0J., concurring). For the reasons that we have explained,\nthe concurrence\u2019s approach is not.3The concurrence would \u201cleave for another day\nwhether to reject any right to an abortion at all,\u201dpost, at\n7, but \u201canother day\u201d would not be long in coming. Some States have\nset deadlines for obtaining an abortion that are shorter than\nMississippi\u2019s. See,e.g.,Memphis Center for Reproductive\nHealthv.Slatery, 14 F. 4th, at 414 (considering law\nwith bans \u201cat cascading intervals of two to three weeks\u201d beginning\nat six weeks), reh\u2019g en banc granted, 14 F. 4th 550 (CA6 2021). If\nwe held only that Mississippi\u2019s 15-week rule is constitutional, we\nwould soon be called upon to pass on the constitutionality of a\npanoply of laws with shorter deadlines or no deadline at all. The\n\u201cmeasured course\u201d charted by the concurrence would be fraught with\nturmoil until the Court answered the question that the concurrence\nseeks to defer.Even if the Court ultimately adopted the new\nrule suggested by the concurrence, we would be faced with the\ndifficult problem of spelling out what it means. For example, if\nthe period required to give women a \u201creasonable\u201d opportunity to\nobtain an abortion were pegged, as the concurrence seems to\nsuggest, at the point when a certain percentage of women make that\nchoice, seepost, at 1\u20132, 9\u201310, we would have to identify\nthe relevant percentage. It would also be necessary to explain what\nthe concurrence means when it refers to \u201crare circumstances\u201d that\nmight justify an exception.Post, at 10. And if this new\nright aims to give women a reasonable opportunity to get an\nabortion, it would be necessary to decide whether factors other\nthan promptness in deciding might have a bearing on whether such an\nopportunity was available.In sum, the concurrence\u2019s quest for a middle way\nwould only put off the day when we would be forced to confront the\nquestion we now decide. The turmoil wrought byRoeandCaseywould be prolonged. It is far better\u2014for this Court\nand the country\u2014to face up to the real issue without further\ndelay.VIWe must now decide what standard will govern\nif state abortion regulations undergo constitutional challenge and\nwhether the law before us satisfies the appropriate standard.AUnder our precedents, rational-basis review is\nthe appropriate standard for such challenges. As we have explained,\nprocuring an abortion is not a fundamental constitutional right\nbecause such a right has no basis in the Constitution\u2019s text or in\nour Nation\u2019s history. Seesupra,at 8\u201339.It follows that the States may regulate abortion\nfor legitimate reasons, and when such regulations are challenged\nunder the Constitution, courts cannot \u201csubstitute their social and\neconomic beliefs for the judgment of legislative bodies.\u201dFerguson, 372 U.\u00a0S., at 729\u2013730; see alsoDandridgev.Williams,397 U.S.\n471, 484\u2013486 (1970);United Statesv.Carolene\nProducts Co.,304 U.S.\n144, 152 (1938). That respect for a legislature\u2019s judgment\napplies even when the laws at issue concern matters of great social\nsignificance and moral substance. See,e.g.,Board of\nTrustees of Univ. of Ala.v.Garrett,531 U.S.\n356, 365\u2013368 (2001) (\u201ctreatment of the disabled\u201d);Glucksberg, 521 U.\u00a0S., at 728 (\u201cassisted suicide\u201d);San Antonio Independent School Dist.v.Rodriguez,411 U.S.\n1, 32\u201335, 55 (1973) (\u201cfinancing public education\u201d).A law regulating abortion, like other health and\nwelfare laws, is entitled to a \u201cstrong presumption of validity.\u201dHellerv.Doe,509 U.S.\n312, 319 (1993). It must be sustained if there is a rational\nbasis on which the legislature could have thought that it would\nserve legitimate state interests.Id.,at 320;FCCv.Beach Communications,Inc.,508\nU.S. 307, 313 (1993);New Orleansv.Dukes,427 U.S.\n297, 303 (1976) (per\u00a0curiam);Williamsonv.Lee Optical of Okla., Inc.,348 U.S.\n483, 491 (1955). These legitimate interests include respect for\nand preservation of prenatal life at all stages of development,Gonzales, 550 U.\u00a0S., at 157\u2013158; the protection of\nmaternal health and safety; the elimination of particularly\ngruesome or barbaric medical procedures; the preservation of the\nintegrity of the medical profession; the mitigation of fetal pain;\nand the prevention of discrimination on the basis of race, sex, or\ndisability. Seeid., at 156\u2013157;Roe, 410 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 150; cf.Glucksberg, 521 U.\u00a0S., at 728\u2013731\n(identifying similar interests).BThese legitimate interests justify\nMississippi\u2019s Gestational Age Act. Except \u201cin a medical emergency\nor in the case of a severe fetal abnormality,\u201d the statute\nprohibits abortion \u201cif the probable gestational age of the unborn\nhuman being has been determined to be greater than fifteen (15)\nweeks.\u201d Miss. Code Ann. \u00a741\u201341\u2013191(4)(b). The Mississippi\nLegislature\u2019s findings recount the stages of \u201chuman prenatal\ndevelopment\u201d and assert the State\u2019s interest in \u201cprotecting the\nlife of the unborn.\u201d \u00a72(b)(i). The legislature also found that\nabortions performed after 15 weeks typically use the dilation and\nevacuation procedure, and the legislature found the use of this\nprocedure \u201cfor nontherapeutic or elective reasons [to be] a\nbarbaric practice, dangerous for the maternal patient, and\ndemeaning to the medical profession.\u201d \u00a72(b)(i)(8); see alsoGonzales, 550 U.\u00a0S., at 135\u2013143 (describing such\nprocedures). These legitimate interests provide a rational basis\nfor the Gestational Age Act, and it follows that respondents\u2019\nconstitutional challenge must fail.VIIWe end this opinion where we began. Abortion\npresents a profound moral question. The Constitution does not\nprohibit the citizens of each State from regulating or prohibiting\nabortion.RoeandCaseyarrogated that authority. We\nnow overrule those decisions and return that authority to the\npeople and their elected representatives.The judgment of the Fifth Circuit is reversed,\nand the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with\nthis opinion.It is so ordered.APPENDICESAThis appendix contains statutes criminalizing\nabortion at all stages of pregnancy in the States existing in 1868.\nThe statutes

Wheeler, 315 Mass. 394, 395, 53\nN.E.2d 4, 5 (1944).

See,e.g.,June Medical Services L.\u00a0L.\u00a0C.v.Russo,\n591 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2020) (holding a law requiring doctors\nperforming abortions to secure admitting privileges to be\nunconstitutional);Whole Woman\u2019s Healthv.Hellerstedt, 579 U.S. 582 (2016) (similar);Casey,\n505 U.\u00a0S., at 846 (declaring that prohibitions on \u201cabortion\nbefore viability\u201d are unconstitutional);id., at 887\u2013898\n(holding that a spousal notification provision was\nunconstitutional). In addition,Doev.Bolton,410 U.S.\n179(1973), has been interpreted by some to protect a broad\nright to obtain an abortion at any stage of pregnancy provided that\na physician is willing to certify that it is needed due to a\nwoman\u2019s \u201cemotional\u201d needs or \u201cfamilial\u201d concerns.Id., at\n192.

And it is beyond dispute thatRoehas had that\ndemographic effect. A highly disproportionate percentage of aborted\nfetuses are Black.

See 124Stat. 163, 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a718022(b)(1)(D). The\nACA also prohibits annual limits, see \u00a7300gg\u201311, and limits annual\ncost-sharing obligations on such benefits, \u00a718022(c). State\nMedicaid plans must provide coverage for pregnancy-related\nservices\u2014including, but not limited to, prenatal care, delivery,\nand postpartum care\u2014as well as services for other conditions that\nmight complicate the pregnancy. 42 CFR \u00a7\u00a7440.210(a)(2)(i)\u2013(ii)\n(2020).
