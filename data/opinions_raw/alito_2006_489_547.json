    "text": "OPINION OF THE COURTZEDNER V. UNITED STATES547 U. S. ____ (2006)SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESNO. 05-5992JACOB ZEDNER, PETITIONERv.UNITED\nSTATESon writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the second circuit[June 5, 2006]Justice Alito delivered the\nopinion of the Court.This case requires us to consider\nthe application of the doctrines of waiver, judicial estoppel, and\nharmless error to a violation of the Speedy Trial Act of 1974\n(Act), 18 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a73161\u20133174. The Act generally requires a\nfederal criminal trial to begin within 70 days after a defendant is\ncharged or makes an initial appearance, \u00a73161(c)(1), but the Act\ncontains a detailed scheme under which certain specified periods of\ndelay are not counted. In this case, petitioner\u2019s trial did not\nbegin within 70 days of indictment. Indeed, his trial did not\ncommence until more than seven years after the filing of the\nindictment, but petitioner, at the suggestion of the trial judge,\nsigned a blanket, prospective waiver of his rights under the Act.\nWe address the following questions: whether this waiver was\neffective; whether petitioner is judicially estopped from\nchallenging the validity of the waiver; and whether the trial\njudge\u2019s failure to make the findings required to exclude a period\nof delay under a particular provision of the Act, \u00a73161(h)(8), was\nharmless error.IIn March 1996, petitioner\nattempted to open accounts at seven financial institutions using\ncounterfeit $10 million United States bonds. The quality of the\ncounterfeiting was, to put it mildly, not expert. One bond\npurported to be issued by the \u201cMinistry of Finance of U.\nS.\u00a0A.\u201d 401 F.\u00a03d 36, 39 (CA2 2005) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). Others contained misspelled words such as \u201cThunted\nStates\u201d and the \u201cOnited States\u201d (United States), \u201cDhtladelphla\u201d\n(Philadelphia), \u201cCgicago\u201d (Chicago), and \u201cforevev\u201d (forever).Id.,at 39, n.\u00a01 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nAfter petitioner presented these bonds, the Secret Service was\ncontacted, and petitioner was arrested. Following arraignment on a\ncriminal complaint, he was released on bond.On April 4, 1996, a grand jury in\nthe Eastern District of New York indicted petitioner on seven\ncounts of attempting to defraud a financial institution, in\nviolation of 18 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71344, and one count of knowingly\npossessing counterfeit obligations of the United States, in\nviolation of \u00a7472. On June 26, the District Court, citing the\ncomplexity of the case, granted what is termed an \u201cends-of-justice\u201d\ncontinuance, see \u00a73161(h)(8)(B)(ii), until September 6. On\nSeptember 6, the District Court granted another continuance, this\ntime until November 8.At the November 8 status conference,\npetitioner requested, without opposition from the Government, a\nfurther adjournment to January 1997. Concerned about the difficulty\nof fitting petitioner\u2019s trial into its heavily scheduled calendar\nand the prospect that petitioner might \u201conly waive [the Act] for so\nlong as it is convenient for [him] to waive,\u201d the District Court\ninstructed petitioner as follows: \u201cI think if I\u2019m going to give you\nthat long an adjournment, I will have to take a waiver for all\ntime.\u201d App. 71. Petitioner\u2019s counsel responded that the defense\nwould \u201cwaive for all time. That will not be a problem. That will\nnot be an issue in this case.\u201dId.,at 72.The District Court then addressed petitioner\ndirectly and appears to have attempted to explain the operation of\na provision of the Act, 18 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a73162(a)(2), under which a\ndefendant whose trial does not begin on time is deemed to have\nwaived the right to move for dismissal of the information or\nindictment if he or she does not file that motion prior to trial or\nentry of a guilty plea. The District Court reasoned: \u201c[I]f you can\nwaive [the Act] by inaction,i.e., not\nraising the motion to dismiss, you can waive affirmatively,\nknowledgeably, intelligently your right to do so, your right to a\nspeedy trial and your right to make a motion to dismiss for the\nspeedy trial.\u201d App. 73. The court told petitioner that it was\n\u201cprepared to start \u2026 trial right away,\u201dibid.,but that if\na continuance was granted, petitioner might have to wait some time\nfor trial because the court had a \u201cfairly big cas[e] \u2026 which [wa]s\nset to take eight months for trial.\u201d \u201c[I]f that [trial] starts\nbefore you start,\u201d the court warned, \u201cyou may have to wait until\nthat is done.\u201dId.,at 74.The District Court then produced a preprinted\nform\u2014apparently of its own devising\u2014captioned \u201cWaiver of Speedy\nTrial Rights.\u201dId.,at 79. The court led petitioner and\nhis counsel through the form, and both signed it. Among other\nthings, the form stated: \u201cI wish to waive my rights to a speedy\ntrial \u2026 under the Speedy Trial Act of 1974 (18 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a73161et seq.), under the Rules of this Circuit and under the\nSpeedy Trial Plan adopted by this Court.\u201dIbid.The form\nalso stated: \u201cI have been advised and fully understand that \u2026 I\nalso waive any and all rights to make a motion to dismiss the\nindictment \u2026 against me for failure of the Court to give me a\nspeedy trial and that I waive all of such rights to a speedy trial\nand to make such a motion or motions for all time.\u201dIbid.After the form was signed, petitioner\u2019s counsel requested that a\nfurther status conference be scheduled for January 31, 1997, and\nthe court agreed.Id.,at 77.At the January 31 status conference,\npetitioner sought yet another continuance \u201cto tap \u2026 the proper\nchannels to authenticate [the] bonds.\u201dId.,at 81.\nPetitioner and the Government emphasized that this request raised\nno issue under the Act because petitioner had \u201cwaived for all\ntime,\u201d though the Government suggested that it \u201cwould like to try\nthe case sometime in 1997.\u201dIbid.After a brief discussion\nbetween the court and petitioner\u2019s counsel about the need to\ninvestigate the authenticity of what seemed such obviously fake\nbonds, the court offered to set trial for May 5, 1997.Id.,at 86. The court admonished petitioner\u2019s counsel to\n\u201c[g]et to work\u201d and noted: \u201cThis [case] is a year old. That\u2019s\nenough for a criminal case.\u201dId.,at 86, 85. Nevertheless,\napparently satisfied with petitioner\u2019s waiver \u201cfor all time,\u201d the\nDistrict Court made no mention of the Act and did not make any\nfindings to support exclusion of the 91 days between January 31 and\npetitioner\u2019s next court appearance on May 2, 1997 (1997\ncontinuance).The four years that followed saw a variety of\nproceedings in petitioner\u2019s case, but no trial. See 401 F.\u00a03d,\nat 40\u201341. Counsel sought to be relieved because petitioner insisted\nthat he argue that the bonds were genuine, and the court ultimately\ngranted counsel\u2019s request to withdraw. At the court\u2019s suggestion,\npetitioner was examined by a psychiatrist, who determined that\npetitioner was competent to stand trial. Petitioner then asked to\nproceedpro seand sought to serve subpoenas on, among\nothers, the President, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board,\nthe Attorney General, the Secretary of State, the late Chinese\nleader Chiang Kai-shek, and \u201c\u00a0\u2018The Treasury Department of\nTreasury International Corporation.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId.,at 40;\nApp. 129. After a year of quashed subpoenas, the District Court set\nthe case for trial, only to conclude on the morning of jury\nselection that it had to inquire once again into petitioner\u2019s\ncompetency. The court dismissed the jury panel, found petitioner\nincompetent, and committed him to the custody of the Attorney\nGeneral for hospitalization and treatment. On interlocutory appeal,\nhowever, the Court of Appeals vacated that order and remanded for\nfurther hearings. In July and August 2000, the District Court held\nthose hearings and received further briefing on the competency\nissue.On March 7, 2001, while the competency issue\nremained under submission, petitioner moved to dismiss the\nindictment for failure to comply with the Act. The District Court\ndenied the motion on the ground that petitioner had waived his\nSpeedy Trial Act rights \u201cfor all time,\u201d mentioning in passing that\nthe case was complex.Id.,at 128\u2013129. In the same order,\nthe court found petitioner incompetent.Id.,at 135. That\nlatter determination was upheld on interlocutory appeal, and\npetitioner was committed for evaluation. After several months of\nhospitalization, petitioner was found to be delusional but\ncompetent to stand trial, and he was released.Finally, on April 7, 2003, more than seven\nyears after petitioner was indicted, his trial began. The jury\nfound petitioner guilty on six counts of attempting to defraud a\nfinancial institution,[Footnote\n1] and the court sentenced him to 63 months of\nimprisonment.The Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of\nconviction.[Footnote 2]\nAcknowledging that \u201ca defendant\u2019s waiver of rights under the Speedy\nTrial Act may be ineffective\u201d because of the public interest served\nby compliance with the Act, the Court of Appeals found an exception\nfor situations \u201c\u00a0\u2018when defendant\u2019s conduct causes or\ncontributes to a period of delay.\u2019\u00a0\u201d 401 F. 3d,at\n43\u201344 (quotingUnited Statesv.Gambino, 59\nF.\u00a03d 353, 360 (CA2 1995)). \u201c[D]oubt[ing] that the public\ninterest in expeditious prosecution would be served by a rule that\nallows defendants to request a delay and then protest the grant of\ntheir request,\u201d the Court of Appeals held that petitioner would not\nbe heard to complain of the 91-day delay in early 1997. 401\nF.\u00a03d, at 45. The Court of Appeals went on to suggest that\nthere \u201ccan be no doubt that the district court could have properly\nexcluded this period of time based on the ends of justice\u201d in light\nof the complexity of the case and defense counsel\u2019s request for\nadditional time to prepare.Ibid.We granted certiorari to resolve the\ndisagreement among the Courts of Appeals on the standard for\nanalyzing whether a defendant has made an effective waiver of\nrights under the Act. 546 U. S. ___ (2006).IIAs noted above, the Speedy Trial\nAct generally requires a trial to begin within 70 days of the\nfiling of an information or indictment or the defendant\u2019s initial\nappearance, 18 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a73161(c)(1), but the Act recognizes\nthat criminal cases vary widely and that there are valid reasons\nfor greater delay in particular cases. To provide the necessary\nflexibility, the Act includes a long and detailed list of periods\nof delay that are excluded in computing the time within which trial\nmust start. See \u00a73161(h). For example, the Act excludes \u201cdelay\nresulting from other proceedings concerning the defendant,\u201d\n\u00a73161(h)(1), \u201cdelay resulting from the absence or unavailability of\nthe defendant or an essential witness,\u201d \u00a73161(h)(3), \u201cdelay\nresulting from the fact that the defendant is mentally incompetent\nor physically unable to stand trial,\u201d \u00a73161(h)(4), and \u201c[a]\nreasonable period of delay when the defendant is joined for trial\nwith a codefendant as to whom the time for trial has not run and no\nmotion for severance has been granted,\u201d \u00a73161(h)(7).Much of the Act\u2019s flexibility is\nfurnished by \u00a73161(h)(8), which governs ends-of-justice\ncontinuances, and which we set out in relevant part in the\nmargin.[Footnote 3] This\nprovision permits a district court to grant a continuance and to\nexclude the resulting delay if the court, after considering certain\nfactors, makes on-the-record findings that the ends of justice\nserved by granting the continuance outweigh the public\u2019s and\ndefendant\u2019s interests in a speedy trial. This provision gives the\ndistrict court discretion\u2014within limits and subject to specific\nprocedures\u2014to accommodate limited delays for case-specific\nneeds.To promote compliance with its requirements,\nthe Act contains enforcement and sanctions provisions. If a trial\ndoes not begin on time, the defendant may move, before the start of\ntrial or the entry of a guilty plea, to dismiss the charges, and if\na meritorious and timely motion to dismiss is filed, the district\ncourt must dismiss the charges, though it may choose whether to\ndismiss with or without prejudice. In making that choice, the court\nmust take into account, among other things, \u201cthe seriousness of the\noffense; the facts and circumstances of the case which led to the\ndismissal; and the impact of a reprosecution on the administration\nof [the Act] and on the administration of justice.\u201d\n\u00a73162(a)(2).This scheme is designed to promote compliance\nwith the Act without needlessly subverting important criminal\nprosecutions. The more severe sanction (dismissal with prejudice)\nis available for use where appropriate, and the knowledge that a\nviolation could potentially result in the imposition of this\nsanction gives the prosecution a powerful incentive to be careful\nabout compliance. The less severe sanction (dismissal without\nprejudice) lets the court avoid unduly impairing the enforcement of\nfederal criminal laws\u2014though even this sanction imposes some costs\non the prosecution and the court, which further encourages\ncompliance. When an indictment is dismissed without prejudice, the\nprosecutor may of course seek\u2014and in the great majority of cases\nwill be able to obtain\u2014a new indictment, for even if \u201cthe period\nprescribed by the applicable statute of limitations has expired, a\nnew indictment may be returned \u2026 within six calendar months of the\ndate of the dismissal.\u201d \u00a73288.With this background in mind, we turn to the\nquestions presented by the unusual procedures followed in this\ncase.IIIPetitioner contends, and the\nGovernment does not seriously dispute, that a defendant may not\nprospectively waive the application of the Act.[Footnote 4] We agree.A1As our discussion above suggests,\nthe Speedy Trial Act comprehensively regulates the time within\nwhich a trial must begin. Section 3161(h) specifies in detail\nnumerous categories of delay that are not counted in applying the\nAct\u2019s deadlines. Conspicuously, \u00a73161(h) has no provision excluding\nperiods of delay during which a defendant waives the application of\nthe Act, and it is apparent from the terms of the Act that this\nomission was a considered one. Instead of simply allowing\ndefendants to opt out of the Act, the Act demands that defense\ncontinuance requests fit within one of the specific exclusions set\nout in subsection (h). Subsection (h)(8), which permits\nends-of-justice continuances, was plainly meant to cover many of\nthese requests. Among the factors that a district court must\nconsider in deciding whether to grant an ends-of-justice\ncontinuance are a defendant\u2019s need for \u201creasonable time to obtain\ncounsel,\u201d \u201ccontinuity of counsel,\u201d and \u201ceffective preparation\u201d of\ncounsel. \u00a73161(h)(8)(B)(iv). If a defendant could simply waive the\napplication of the Act whenever he or she wanted more time, no\ndefendant would ever need to put such considerations before the\ncourt under the rubric of an ends-of-justice exclusion.The purposes of the Act also cut\nagainst exclusion on the grounds of mere consent or waiver. If the\nAct were designed solely to protect a defendant\u2019s right to a speedy\ntrial, it would make sense to allow a defendant to waive the\napplication of the Act. But the Act was designed with the public\ninterest firmly in mind. See,e.g.,18 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a73161(h)(8)(A) (to exclude delay resulting from a continuance\u2014even\none \u201cgranted \u2026 at the request of the defendant\u201d\u2014the district court\nmust find \u201cthat the ends of justice served \u2026 outweigh thebest\ninterest of the publicand the defendantin a speedy\ntrial\u201d (emphasis added)). That public interest cannot be\nserved, the Act recognizes, if defendants may opt out of the Act\nentirely.2This interpretation is entirely\nin accord with the Act\u2019s legislative history. As both the 1974\nHouse and Senate Reports illustrate, the Act was designed not just\nto benefit defendants but also to serve the public interest by,\namong other things, reducing defendants\u2019 opportunity to commit\ncrimes while on pretrial release and preventing extended pretrial\ndelay from impairing the deterrent effect of punishment. See\nS.\u00a0Rep. No. 93\u20131021, pp.\u00a06\u20138 (citing \u201cbail problems,\u201d\noffenses committed during pretrial release, and the \u201cseriously\nundermined \u2026 deterrent value of the criminal process\u201d as \u201cthe\ndebilitating effect[s] of court delay upon our criminal justice\nsystem\u201d); H.\u00a0R. Rep. No. 93\u20131508, p.\u00a08 (\u201cThe purpose of\nthis bill is to assist in reducing crime and the danger of\nrecidivism by requiring speedy trials \u2026\u201d). The Senate Report\naccompanying the 1979 amendments to the Act put an even finer point\non it: \u201c[T]he Act seeks to protect and promote speedy trial\ninterests that go beyond the rights of the defendant; although the\nSixth Amendment recognizes a societal interest in prompt\ndispositions, it primarily safeguards the defendant\u2019s speedy trial\nright\u2014which may or may not be in accord with society\u2019s.\u201d\nS.\u00a0Rep. No. 96\u2013212, p.\u00a029; see alsoid.,at 6;\nH.\u00a0R. Rep. No. 96\u2013390, p.\u00a03 (1979). Because defendants\nmay be content to remain on pretrial release, and indeed may\nwelcome delay, it is unsurprising that Congress refrained from\nempowering defendants to make prospective waivers of the Act\u2019s\napplication. See S.\u00a0Rep. No. 96\u2013212, at 29 (\u201cBecause of the\nAct\u2019s emphasis on that societal right, a defendant ought not be\npermitted to waive rights that are not his or hers alone to\nrelinquish\u201d).BThe District Court reasoned that\n18 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a73162(a)(2) supports the conclusion that a\ndefendant may prospectively waive the strictures of the Act. This\nprovision states that \u201c[f]ailure of the defendant to move for\ndismissal prior to trial or entry of a plea of guilty or nolo\ncontendere shall constitute a waiver of the right to dismissal\nunder this section.\u201d Because this provision in effect allows a\ndefendant to waive a completed violation of the Act (by declining\nto move to dismiss before the start of trial or the entry of a\nguilty plea), it follows, so the District Court\u2019s reasoning went,\nthat a defendant should be allowed to make a prospective waiver. We\ndisagree.It is significant that\n\u00a73162(a)(2) makes no mention of prospective waivers, and there is\nno reason to think that Congress wanted to treat prospective and\nretrospective waivers similarly. Allowing prospective waivers would\nseriously undermine the Act because there are many cases\u2014like the\ncase at hand\u2014in which the prosecution, the defense, and the court\nwould all be happy to opt out of the Act, to the detriment of the\npublic interest. The sort of retrospective waiver allowed by\n\u00a73161(a)(2) does not pose a comparable danger because the\nprosecution and the court cannot know until the trial actually\nstarts or the guilty plea is actually entered whether the defendant\nwill forgo moving to dismiss. As a consequence, the prosecution and\nthe court retain a strong incentive to make sure that the trial\nbegins on time.Instead of granting broad opt-out rights,\n\u00a73162(a)(2) serves two unrelated purposes. First, \u00a73162(a)(2)\nassigns the role of spotting violations of the Act to\ndefendants\u2014for the obvious reason that they have the greatest\nincentive to perform this task.[Footnote 5] Second, by requiring that a defendant move\nbefore the trial starts or a guilty plea is entered, \u00a73162(a)(2)\nboth limits the effects of a dismissal with- out prejudice (by\nensuring that an expensive and time-consuming trial will not be\nmooted by a late-filed motion under the Act) and prevents undue\ndefense gamesmanship.[Footnote\n6]For these reasons, we reject the District\nCourt\u2019s reliance on \u00a73162(a)(2) and conclude a defendant may not\nprospectively waive the application of the Act. It follows that\npetitioner\u2019s waiver \u201cfor all time\u201d was ineffective. We therefore\nturn to the Government\u2019s alternative grounds in support of the\nresult below.IVAThe Government contends that\nbecause \u201cpetitioner\u2019s express waiver induced the district court to\ngrant a continuance without making an express ends-of-justice\nfinding \u2026, basic principles of judicial estoppel preclude\npetitioner from enjoying the benefit of the continuance, but then\nchallenging the lack of a finding.\u201d Brief for United States 10. In\nthis case, however, we see no basis for applying the doctrine of\njudicial estoppel.As this Court has explained:\u201c\u00a0\u2018[W]here a party assumes a\ncertain position in a legal proceeding, and succeeds in maintaining\nthat position, he may not thereafter, simply because his interests\nhave changed, assume a contrary position, especially if it be to\nthe prejudice of the party who has acquiesced in the position\nformerly taken by him.\u2019Davisv.Wakelee,156 U. S. 680,\n689 (1895). This rule, known as judicial estoppel, \u2018generally\nprevents a party from prevailing in one phase of a case on an\nargument and then relying on a contradictory argument to prevail in\nanother phase.\u2019Pegramv.Herdrich,530 U. S. 211, 227,\nn.\u00a08 (2000).\u201dNew Hampshirev.Maine,532 U. S. 742,\n749 (2001).Although this estoppel doctrine is equitable and\nthus cannot be reduced to a precise formula or test,\u201cseveral factors typically inform the decision\nwhether to apply the doctrine in a particular case: First, a\nparty\u2019s later position must be clearly inconsistent with its\nearlier position. Second, courts regularly inquire whether the\nparty has succeeded in persuading a court to accept that party\u2019s\nearlier position \u2026\u00a0. A third consideration is whether the\nparty seeking to assert an inconsistent position would derive an\nunfair advantage or impose an unfair detriment on the opposing\nparty if not estopped.\u201dId., at 750\u2013751 (citations and\ninternal quotation marks omitted).In applying this doctrine to the\npresent case, we must first identify the \u201cposition\u201d of petitioner\u2019s\nthat the Government seeks to enforce. There are three\npossibilities: (1) petitioner\u2019s promise not to move for dismissal\nunder \u00a73162(a)(2), (2) petitioner\u2019s (implied) position that waivers\nof the Act are enforceable, and (3) petitioner\u2019s claim that counsel\nneeded additional time to research the authenticity of the bonds.\nNone of these gives rise to an estoppel.First, we are unwilling to recognize an\nestoppel based on petitioner\u2019s promise not to move for dismissal\nbecause doing so would entirely swallow the Act\u2019s no-waiver policy.\nWe see little difference between granting a defendant\u2019s request for\na continuance in exchange for a promise not to move for dismissal\nand permitting a prospective waiver, and as we hold above,\nprospective waivers are inconsistent with the Act.Second, petitioner\u2019s (mistaken) agreement that\nSpeedy Trial Act waivers are valid also does not provide a ground\nfor estoppel. Petitioner did not \u201csuccee[d] in persuading\u201d the\nDistrict Court to accept the proposition that prospective waivers\nof Speedy Trial Act rights are valid. On the contrary, it was the\nDistrict Court that requested the waiver and produced the form for\npetitioner to sign. And while the other relevant factors (clear\ninconsistency and unfair advantage or detriment) might in isolation\nsupport the Government, we think they do not predominate where, as\nhere, the Government itself accepted the District Court\u2019s\ninterpretation without objection.Finally, petitioner\u2019s representation to the\nDistrict Court at the January 31 status conference that a\ncontinuance was needed to gather evidence of the bonds\u2019\nauthenticity does not support the Government\u2019s estoppel argument\nbecause the position that petitioner took then was not \u201cclearly\ninconsistent\u201d with the position that he now takes in seeking\ndismissal of the indictment. This would be a different case if\npetitioner had succeeded in persuading the District Court at the\nJanuary 31 status conference that the factual predicate for a\nstatutorily authorized exclusion of delay could be established\u2014for\nexample, if defense counsel had obtained a continuance only by\nfalsely representing that he was in the midst of working with an\nexpert who might authenticate the bonds. In fact, however, the\ndiscussion at the January 31 status conference did not focus on the\nrequirements of the Act. Rather, the court and the parties\nproceeded on the assumption that the court\u2019s waiver form was valid\nand that the Act could simply be disregarded. Nothing in the\ndiscussion at the conference suggests that the question presented\nby the defense continuance request was viewed as anything other\nthan a case-management question that lay entirely within the scope\nof the District Court\u2019s discretion. Under these circumstances, the\nbest understanding of the position taken by petitioner\u2019s attorney\nat the January 31 status conference is that granting the requested\ncontinuance would represent a sound exercise of the trial judge\u2019s\ndiscretion in managing its calendar. This position was not \u201cclearly\ninconsistent\u201d with petitioner\u2019s later position that the continuance\nwas not permissible under the terms of the Act. Accordingly, we\nhold that petitioner is not estopped from challenging the\nexcludability under the Act of the 1997 continuance.BWhile conceding that the District\nCourt \u201cnever made an express finding on the record\u201d about the\nends-of-justice balance, Brief for United States 30, the Government\nargues that such an express finding did not need to be entered\ncontemporaneously\u2014and could be supplied on remand\u2014because, given\nthe circumstances in 1997, the ends-of-justice balance in fact\nsupported the 1997 continuance. We reject this argument. In the\nfirst place, the Act requires express findings, and in the second\nplace, it does not permit those findings to be made on remand as\nthe Government proposes.The Act requires that when a\ndistrict court grants an ends-of-justice continuance, it must\n\u201cse[t] forth, in the record of the case, either orally or in\nwriting, its reasons\u201d for finding that the ends of justice are\nserved and they outweigh other interests. 18 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a73161(h)(8)(A). Although the Act is clear that the findings must be\nmade, if only in the judge\u2019s mind, before granting the continuance\n(the continuance can only be \u201cgranted \u2026 on the basis of [the\ncourt\u2019s] findings\u201d), the Act is ambiguous on precisely when those\nfindings must be \u201cse[t] forth, in the record of the case.\u201d However\nthis ambiguity is resolved, at the very least the Act implies that\nthose findings must be put on the record by the time a district\ncourt rules on a defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss under\n\u00a73162(a)(2).[Footnote 7] In\nruling on a defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, the court must tally the\nunexcluded days. This, in turn, requires identifying the excluded\ndays. But \u00a73161(h)(8)(A) is explicit that \u201c[n]o \u2026 period of delay\nresulting from a continuance granted by the court in accordance\nwith this paragraph shall be excludable \u2026 unless the court sets\nforth \u2026 its reasons for [its] finding[s].\u201d Thus, without\non-the-record findings, there can be no exclusion under\n\u00a73161(h)(8). Here, the District Court set forth no such findings at\nthe January 31 status conference, and \u00a73161(h)(8)(A) is not\nsatisfied by the District Court\u2019s passing reference to the case\u2019s\ncomplexity in its ruling on petitioner\u2019s motion to dismiss.\nTherefore, the 1997 continuance is not excluded from the speedy\ntrial clock.The Government suggests that this error,\nstemming as it does from the District Court\u2019s technical failure to\nmake an express finding, may be regarded as harmless. Brief for\nUnited States 31, n.\u00a08. Harmless-error review under Federal\nRule of Criminal Procedure 52(a) presumptively applies to\n\u201callerrors where a proper objection is made,\u201dNederv.United States,527 U. S. 1, 7 (1999), and\nwe have required \u201cstrong support\u201d to find an implied repeal of Rule\n52,United Statesv.Vonn,535 U. S. 55, 65 (2002).\nWe conclude, however, that the provisions of the Act provide such\nsupport here.The relevant provisions of the Act are\nunequivocal. If a defendant pleads not guilty, the trial\n\u201cshallcommence\u201d within 70 days \u201cfrom the filing date (and\nmaking public) of the information or indictment\u201d or from the\ndefendant\u2019s initial appearance, whichever is later. \u00a73161(c)(1)\n(emphasis added). Delay resulting from an ends-of-justice\ncontinuance is excluded from this time period, but\u201c[n]o such\nperiod of delay \u2026 shall be excludableunder this subsection\nunless the court sets forth, in the record of the case, either\norally or in writing, its reasons for finding that the ends of\njustice served by the granting of such continuance outweigh the\nbest interests of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.\u201d\n\u00a73161(h)(8)(A) (emphasis added). When a trial is not commenced\nwithin the prescribed period of time, \u201cthe information or\nindictmentshall be dismissedon motion of the defendant.\u201d\n\u00a73162(a)(2) (emphasis added). A straightforward reading of these\nprovisions leads to the conclusion that if a judge fails to make\nthe requisite findings regarding the need for an ends-of-justice\ncontinuance, the delay resulting from the continuance must be\ncounted, and if as a result the trial does not begin on time, the\nindictment or information must be dismissed. The argument that the\nDistrict Court\u2019s failure to make the prescribed findings may be\nexcused as harmless error is hard to square with the Act\u2019s\ncategorical terms. SeeAlabamav.Bozeman,533 U. S. 146,\n153\u2013154 (2001) (no \u201c\u00a0\u2018harmless\u2019\u00a0\u201d or\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018technical\u2019\u00a0\u201d violations of the Interstate Agreement on\nDetainers\u2019 \u201cantishuttling\u201d provision in light of its \u201cabsolute\nlanguage\u201d).Applying the harmless-error rule would also\ntend to undermine the detailed requirements of the provisions\nregulating ends-of-justice continuances. The exclusion of delay\nresulting from an ends-of-justice continuance is the most\nopen-ended type of exclusion recognized under the Act and, in\nallowing district courts to grant such continuances, Congress\nclearly meant to give district judges a measure of flexibility in\naccommodating unusual, complex, and difficult cases. But it is\nequally clear that Congress, knowing that the many sound grounds\nfor granting ends-of-justice continuances could not be rigidly\nstructured, saw a danger that such continuances could get out of\nhand and subvert the Act\u2019s detailed scheme. The strategy of\n\u00a73161(h)(8), then, is to counteract substantive open-endedness with\nprocedural strictness. This provision demands on-the-record\nfindings and specifies in some detail certain factors that a judge\nmust consider in making those findings. Excusing the failure to\nmake these findings as harmless error would be inconsistent with\nthe strategy embodied in \u00a73161(h). Such an approach would almost\nalways lead to a finding of harmless error because the simple\nfailure to make a record of this sort is unlikely to affect the\ndefendant\u2019s rights. We thus conclude that when a district court\nmakes no findings on the record in support of an \u00a73161(h)(8)\ncontinuance, harmless-error review is not appropriate.VWe hold that that the 91-day\ncontinuance granted on January 31 was not excluded from\npetitioner\u2019s speedy trial clock. Because this continuance by itself\nexceeded the maximum 70-day delay provided in \u00a73161(c)(1), the Act\nwas violated, and we need not address whether any other periods of\ndelay during petitioner\u2019s case were not excludable. The sanction\nfor a violation of the Act is dismissal, but we leave it to the\nDistrict Court to determine in the first instance whether dismissal\nshould be with or without prejudice. See \u00a73162(a)(2). The judgment\nof the Court of Appeals is therefore reversed, and the case is\nremanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.Footnote 1The Government dismissed the other counts\nbefore trial.Footnote 2The Court of Appeals ultimately remanded the\ncase for resentencing in light ofUnited Statesv.Booker,543\nU. S. 220(2005). That issue is not before us, though we note\nthat the District Court has indicated it would impose the same\n63-month sentence if the defendant is produced for resentencing.\nNo. 96\u2013CR\u2013285 (TCP) (EDNY, Oct. 27, 2005).Footnote 3Title 18 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a73161(h)(8) provides:\n\u201c(A) Any period of delay resulting from a continuance granted by\nany judge on his own motion or at the request of the defendant or\nhis counsel or at the request of the attorney for the Government,\nif the judge granted such continuance on the basis of his findings\nthat the ends of justice served by taking such action outweigh the\nbest interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial. No\nsuch period of delay resulting from a continuance granted by the\ncourt in accordance with this paragraph shall be excludable under\nthis subsection unless the court sets forth, in the record of the\ncase, either orally or in writing, its reasons for finding that the\nends of justice served by the granting of such continuance outweigh\nthe best interests of the public and the defendant in a speedy\ntrial.\u201c(B)\u2002The factors, among others, which a judge\nshall consider in determining whether to grant a continuance under\nsubparagraph (A) of this paragraph in any case are as follows:\u201c(i)\u2002Whether the failure to grant such a\ncontinuance in the proceeding would be likely to make a\ncontinuation of such proceeding impossible, or result in a\nmiscarriage of justice.\u201c(ii)\u2002Whether the case is so unusual or so\ncomplex, due to the number of defendants, the nature of the\nprosecution, or the existence of novel questions of fact or law,\nthat it is unreasonable to expect adequate preparation for pretrial\nproceedings or for the trial itself within the time limits\nestablished by this section..\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2002.\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2002.\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2002.\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2002.\u201c(iv)\u2002Whether the failure to grant such a\ncontinuance in a case which, taken as a whole, is not so unusual or\nso complex as to fall within clause (ii), would deny the defendant\nreasonable time to obtain counsel, would unreasonably deny the\ndefendant or the Government continuity of counsel, or would deny\ncounsel for the defendant or the attorney for the Government the\nreasonable time necessary for effective preparation, taking into\naccount the exercise of due diligence.\u201c(C)\u2002No continuance under subparagraph (A) of\nthis paragraph shall be granted because of general congestion of\nthe court\u2019s calendar, or lack of diligent preparation or failure to\nobtain available witnesses on the part of the attorney for the\nGovernment.\u201dFootnote 4We left this question open inNew\nYorkv.Hill,528 U. S. 110, 117, n. 2\n(2000).Footnote 5The possibility of obtaining a dismissal with\nprejudice plainly gives a defendant a strong incentive to police\ncompliance, and even if a case is dismissed without prejudice, a\ndefendant may derive some benefit. For example, the time and energy\nthat the prosecution must expend in connection with obtaining a new\nindictment may be time and energy that the prosecution cannot\ndevote to the preparation of its case.Footnote 6As noted, in order to promote compliance with\nthe Act, Congress set the minimum permissible penalty at a level\nthat would impose some costs on the prosecution and the court\nwithout unduly interfering with the enforcement of the criminal\nlaws. By specifying that a defendant may not move for dismissal\nonce the trial has commenced or a plea has been entered, the amount\nof inconvenience resulting from a dismissal without prejudice is\nlimited, and defendants are restricted in their ability to use such\na motion for strategic purposes. For example, defendants cannot\nwait to see how a trial is going (or how it comes out) before\nmoving to dismiss.Footnote 7The best practice, of course, is for a\ndistrict court to put its findings on the record at or near the\ntime when it grants the continuance.",
