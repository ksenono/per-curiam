To reach that\nresult, the Court relies on two lines of precedent. The first\ninvolves the categorical prohibition of certain punishments for\nspecified classes of offenders. The second requires individualized\nsentencing in the capital punishment context. Neither line is\nconsistent with the original understanding of the Cruel and Unusual\nPunishments Clause. The Court compounds its errors by combining\nthese lines of precedent and extending them to reach a result that\nis even less legitimate than the foundation on which it is built.\nBecause the Court upsets the legislatively enacted sentencing\nregimes of 29 jurisdictions without constitutional warrant, I\nrespectfully dissent.[1]IThe Court first relies on its cases\n\u201cadopt[ing] categorical bans on sentencing practices based on\nmismatches between the culpability of a class of offenders and the\nseverity of a penalty.\u201dAnte, at 6\u20137. Of these categorical\nproportionality cases, the Court places particular emphasis onRoperv.Simmons,543 U.S.\n551(2005), andGrahamv.Florida, 560 U.\u00a0S.\n___ (2010). InRoper, the Court held that the Constitution\nprohibits the execution of an offender who was under 18 at the time\nof his offense. 543 U. S., at 578. TheRoperCourt looked\nto, among other things, its own sense of parental intuition and\n\u201cscientific and sociological studies\u201d to conclude that offenders\nunder the age of 18 \u201ccannot with reliability be classified among\nthe worst offenders.\u201dId., at 569. InGraham, the\nCourt relied on similar considerations to conclude that the\nConstitution prohibits a life-without-parole sentence for a\nnonhomicide offender who was under the age of 18 at the time of his\noffense. 560 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 24).The Court now concludes thatmandatorylife-without-parole sentences for duly convicted juvenile murderers\n\u201ccontraven[e]Graham\u2019s (and alsoRoper\u2019s)\nfoundational principle: that imposition of a State\u2019s most severe\npenalties on juvenile offenders cannot proceed as though they were\nnot children.\u201dAnte, at 11\u201312. But neitherRopernorGrahamheld that specific procedural rules are required for\nsentencing juvenile homicide offenders. And, the logic of those\ncases should not be extended to create such a requirement.The Eighth Amendment, made applicable to the\nStates by the Fourteenth Amendment, provides that: \u201cExcessive bail\nshall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and\nunusual punishments inflicted.\u201d As I have previously explained,\n\u201cthe Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause was originally understood\nas prohibiting torturousmethodsof punishment\u2014specifically\nmethods akin to those that had been considered cruel and unusual at\nthe time the Bill of Rights was adopted.\u201dGraham,supra, at ___ (dissenting opinion) (slip op., at 3)\n(internal quotation marks and citations omitted).[2] The clause does not contain a\n\u201cproportionality principle.\u201dEwingv.California,538 U.S.\n11, 32 (2003) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment); see\ngenerallyHarmelinv.Michigan,501 U.S.\n957, 975\u2013985 (1991) (opinion of Scalia, J.). In short, it does\nnot authorize courts to invalidate any punishment they deem\ndisproportionate to the severity of the crime or to a particular\nclass of offenders. Instead, the clause \u201cleaves the unavoidably\nmoral question of who \u2018deserves\u2019 a particular nonprohibited method\nof punishment to the judgment of the legislatures that authorize\nthe penalty.\u201dGraham,supra, at ___ (Thomas, J.,\ndissenting) (slip op., at 5).The legislatures of Arkansas and Alabama, like\nthose of 27 other jurisdictions,ante, at 19\u201320, have\ndetermined that all offenders convicted of specified homicide\noffenses, whether juveniles or not, deserve a sentence of life in\nprison without the possibility of parole. Nothing in our\nConstitution authorizes this Court to supplant that choice.IITo invalidate mandatory life-without-parole\nsentences for juveniles, the Court also relies on its cases\n\u201cprohibit[ing] mandatory imposition of capital punishment.\u201dAnte, at 7. The Court reasons that, becauseGrahamcompared juvenile life-without-parole sentences to the death\npenalty, the \u201cdistinctive set of legal rules\u201d that this Court has\nimposed in the capital punishment context, including the\nrequirement of individualized sentencing, is \u201crelevant\u201d here.Ante, at 12\u201313. But even accepting an analogy between\ncapital and juvenile life-without-parole sentences, this Court\u2019s\ncases prohibiting mandatory capital sentencing schemes have no\nbasis in the original understanding of the Eighth Amendment, and,\nthus, cannot justify a prohibition of sentencing schemes that\nmandate life-without-parole sentences for juveniles.AIn a line of cases followingFurmanv.Georgia,408\nU.S. 238(1972)(per\u00a0curiam), this Court prohibited\nthe mandatory imposition of the death penalty. SeeWoodsonv.North Carolina,428 U.S.\n280(1976) (plurality opinion);Robertsv.Louisiana,428 U.S.\n325(1976) (same);Sumnerv.Shuman,483 U.S.\n66(1987).Furmanfirst announced the principle that\nStates may not permit sentencers to exercise unguided discretion in\nimposing the death pen- alty. See generally408\nU.S. 238. In response toFurman, many States passed new\nlaws that made the death pen- alty mandatory following conviction\nof specified crimes, thereby eliminating the offending discretion.\nSeeGreggv.Georgia,428 U.S.\n153, 180\u2013181 (1976) (joint opinion of Stewart, Powell, and\nStevens, JJ.). The Court invalidated those statutes inWoodson,Roberts,andSumner. The Court\nreasoned that mandatory capital sentencing schemes were\nproblematic, because they failed \u201cto allow the particularized\nconsideration\u201d of \u201crelevant facets of the character and record of\nthe individual offender or the circumstances of the particular\noffense.\u201dWoodson,supra, at 303\u2013304 (plurality\nopinion).[3]In my view,Woodsonand its progeny were\nwrongly decided. As discussed above, the Cruel and Unusual\nPunishments Clause, as originally understood, prohibits \u201ctorturousmethodsof punishment.\u201d SeeGraham, 560 U.\u00a0S.,\nat ___ (Thomas, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 3) (internal\nquotation marks omitted). It is not concerned with whether a\nparticular lawful method of punishment\u2014whether capital or\nnoncapital\u2014is imposed pursuant to a mandatory or discretionary\nsentencing regime. SeeGardnerv.Florida,430 U.S.\n349, 371 (1977) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting) (\u201cThe prohibition\nof the Eighth Amendment relates to the character of the punishment,\nand not to the process by which it is imposed\u201d). In fact, \u201c[i]n the\nearly days of the Republic,\u201d each crime generally had a defined\npunishment \u201cprescribed with specificity by the legislature.\u201dUnited Statesv.Grayson,438 U.S.\n41, 45 (1978). Capital sentences, to which the Court\nanalogizes, were treated no differently. \u201c[M]andatory death\nsentences abounded in our first Penal Code\u201d and were \u201ccommon in the\nseveral States\u2014both at the time of the founding and throughout the\n19th century.\u201dHarmelin, 501 U.\u00a0S., at 994\u2013995; see\nalsoWoodson,supra, at 289 (plurality opinion) (\u201cAt\nthe time the Eighth Amendment was adopted in 1791, the States\nuniformly followed the common-law practice of making death the\nexclusive and mandatory sentence for certain specified offenses\u201d).\nAccordingly, the idea that the mandatory imposition of an\notherwise-constitutional sentence renders that sentence cruel and\nunusual finds \u201cno support in the text and history of the Eighth\nAmendment.\u201dHarmelin,supra, at 994.Moreover, mandatory death penalty schemes were\n\u201ca perfectly reasonable legislative response to the concerns\nexpressed inFurman\u201d regarding unguided sentencing\ndiscretion, in that they \u201celiminat[ed] explicit jury discretion and\ntreat[ed] all defendants equally.\u201dGrahamv.Collins,506\nU.S. 461, 487 (1993) (Thomas, J., concurring). And, as Justice\nWhite explained more than 30 years ago, \u201ca State is not\nconstitutionally forbidden to provide that the commission of\ncertain crimes conclusively establishes that a criminal\u2019s character\nis such that he deserves death.\u201dRoberts,supra, at\n358 (dissenting opinion). Thus, there is no basis for concluding\nthat a mandatory capi- tal sentencing scheme is unconstitutional.\nBecause the Court\u2019s cases requiring individualized sentencing in\nthe capital context are wrongly decided, they cannot serve as a\nvalid foundation for the novel rule regarding mandatory\nlife-without-parole sentences for juveniles that the Court\nannounces today.BIn any event, this Court has already declined\nto extend its individualized-sentencing rule beyond the death pen-\nalty context. InHarmelin, the defendant was convicted of\npossessing a large quantity of drugs. 501 U.\u00a0S., at 961\n(opinion of Scalia, J.). In accordance with Michigan law, he was\nsentenced to a mandatory term of life in prison without the\npossibility of parole.Ibid.Citing the same line of death\npenalty precedents on which the Court relies today, the defendant\nargued that his sentence, due to its mandatory nature, violated the\nCruel and Unusual Punishments Clause.Id.,at 994\u2013995\n(opinion of the Court).The Court rejected that argument, explaining\nthat \u201c[t]here can be no serious contention .\u00a0.\u00a0. that a\nsentence which is not otherwise cruel and unusual becomes so sim-\nply because it is \u2018mandatory.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId.,at 995. In so\ndoing, the Court refused to analogize to its death penalty cases.\nThe Court noted that those cases had \u201crepeatedly suggested that\nthere is no comparable [individualized-sentencing] requirement\noutside the capital context, because of the qualitative difference\nbetween death and all other penalties.\u201dIbid.The Court\nobserved that, \u201ceven where the difference\u201d between a sentence of\nlife without parole and other sentences of imprisonment \u201cis the\ngreatest,\u201d such a sentence \u201ccannot be compared with death.\u201dId., at 996. Therefore, the Court concluded that the line of\ncases requiring individualized sentencing had been drawn at cap-\nital cases, and that there was \u201cno basis for extending it further.\u201dIbid.Harmelin\u2019s reasoning logically\nextends to these cases. Obviously, the younger the defendant, \u201cthe\ngreat[er]\u201d the difference between a sentence of life without parole\nand other terms of imprisonment.Ibid.But underHarmelin\u2019s rationale, the defendant\u2019s age is immaterial to\nthe Eighth Amendment analysis. Thus, the result in today\u2019s cases\nshould be the same as that inHarmelin. Petitioners, like\nthe defendant inHarmelin, were not sentenced to death.\nAccordingly, this Court\u2019s cases \u201ccreating and clarifying the\nindividualized capital sentencing doctrine\u201d do not apply.Id.,at 995 (internal quotation marks omitted).Nothing about our Constitution, or about the\nqualitative difference between any term of imprisonment and death,\nhas changed sinceHarmelinwas decided 21 years ago. Whathaschanged (or, better yet, \u201cevolved\u201d) is this Court\u2019s\never-expanding line of categorical proportionality cases. The Court\nnow usesRoperandGrahamto jettisonHarmelin\u2019s clear distinction between capital and noncapital\ncases and to apply the former to noncapital juvenile\noffenders.[4] The Court\u2019s\ndecision to do so is even less supportable than the precedents used\nto reach it.IIIAs The Chief Justice notes,ante,at\n8\u20139 (dissenting opinion), the Court lays the groundwork for future\nincursions on the States\u2019 authority to sentence criminals. In its\ncategorical proportionality cases, the Court has considered\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018objective indicia of society\u2019s standards, as expressed in\nlegislative enactments and state practice\u2019 to determine whether\nthere is a national consensus against the sentencing practice at\nissue.\u201dGraham, 560 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 10)\n(quotingRoper, 543 U. S., at 563). InGraham, for\nexample, the Court looked to \u201c[a]ctual sentencing practices\u201d to\nconclude that there was a national consensus against\nlife-without-parole sentences for juvenile nonhomicide offenders.\n560 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 11\u201314); see alsoRoper,supra, at 564\u2013565;Atkinsv.Virginia,536 U.S.\n304, 316 (2002).Today, the Court makes clear that, even though\nits decision leaves intact the discretionary imposition of\nlife-without-parole sentences for juvenile homicide offenders, it\n\u201cthink[s] appropriate occasions for sentencing juveniles to [life\nwithout parole] will be uncommon.\u201dAnte,at 17. That\nstatement may well cause trial judges to shy away from imposing\nlife without parole sentences and embolden appellate judges to set\nthem aside when they are imposed. And, when a future petitioner\nseeks a categorical ban on sentences of life without parole for\njuvenile homicide offenders, this Court will most assuredly look to\nthe \u201cactual sentencing practices\u201d triggered by this case. The Court\nhas, thus, gone from \u201cmerely\u201d divining the societal consensus of\ntoday to shaping the societal consensus of tomorrow.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*Today\u2019s decision invalidates a\nconstitutionally permissible sentencing system based on nothing\nmore than the Court\u2019s belief that \u201cits own sense of morality\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. pre-empts that of the people and their\nrepresentatives.\u201dGraham,supra, at ___ (Thomas, J.,\ndissenting) (slip op., at 29). Because nothing in the Constitution\ngrants the Court the authority it exercises today, I respectfully\ndissent.Notes1I join The Chief\nJustice\u2019s opinion because it accurately explains that, even\naccepting the Court\u2019s precedents, the Court\u2019s holding in today\u2019s\ncases is unsupportable.2Neither the Court nor\npetitioners argue that petitioners\u2019 sentences would have been among\n\u201cthe \u2018modes or acts of punishment that had been considered cruel\nand unusual at the time that the Bill of Rights was\nadopted.\u2019\u00a0\u201dGraham,560 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (Thomas, J.,\ndissenting) (slip op., at 10, n.\u00a03) (quotingFordv.Wainwright,477 U.S.\n399, 405 (1986)). Nor could they. Petitioners were 14 years old\nat the time they committed their crimes. When the Bill of Rights\nwas ratified, 14-year-olds were subject to trial and punishment as\nadult offenders. SeeRoperv.Simmons,543 U.S.\n551, 609, n.\u00a01 (2005) (Scalia, J., dissenting). Further,\nmandatory death sentences were common at that time. SeeHarmelinv.Michigan,501 U.S.\n957, 994\u2013995 (1991). It is therefore implausible that a\n14-year-old\u2019s mandatory prison sentence\u2014of any length, with or\nwithout parole\u2014would have been viewed as cruel and\nunusual.3The Court later extendedWoodson, requiring that capital defendants be permitted to\npresent, and sentencers in capital cases be permitted to consider,\nany relevant mitigating evidence, including the age of the\ndefendant. See,e.g.,Lockettv.Ohio,438 U.S.\n586, 597\u2013608 (1978) (plurality opinion);Eddingsv.Oklahoma,455 U.S.\n104, 110\u2013112 (1982);Skipperv.South Carolina,476 U.S.\n1, 4\u20135 (1986);Johnsonv.Texas,509 U.S.\n350, 361\u2013368 (1993). Whatever the validity of the requirement\nthat sentencers be permitted to consider all mitigating evidence\nwhen deciding whether to impose anonmandatorycapital\nsentence, the Court certainly was wrong to prohibitmandatorycapital sentences. SeeGrahamv.Collins,506 U.S.\n461, 488\u2013500 (1993) (Thomas, J., concurring).4In support of its\ndecision not to applyHarmelinto juvenile offenders, the\nCourt also observes that \u201c\u00a0\u2018[o]ur history is replete with laws\nand judicial recognition that children cannot be viewed simply as\nminiature adults.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAnte, at 19 (quotingJ. D.\nB.v.North Carolina, 564 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip\nop., at 10\u201311) (some internal quotation marks omitted)). That is no\ndoubt true as a general matter, but it does not justify usurping\nauthority that rightfully belongs to the people by imposing a\nconstitutional rule where none exists.",
