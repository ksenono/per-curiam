Major initiatives practically guarantee them. In our\ntime, few pieces of federal legislation rank in significance with\nthe Civil Rights Act of 1964. There, in Title VII, Congress\noutlawed discrimination in the workplace on the basis of race,\ncolor, religion, sex, or national origin. Today, we must decide\nwhether an employer can fire someone simply for being homosexual or\ntransgender. The answer is clear. An employer who fires an\nindividual for being homosexual or transgender fires that person\nfor traits or actions it would not have questioned in members of a\ndifferent sex. Sex plays a necessary and undisguisable role in the\ndecision, exactly what Title VII forbids.Those who adopted the Civil Rights Act might not\nhave anticipated their work would lead to this particular result.\nLikely, they weren\u2019t thinking about many of the Act\u2019s consequences\nthat have become apparent over the years, including its prohibition\nagainst discrimination on the basis of motherhood or its ban on the\nsexual harassment of male employees. But the limits of the\ndrafters\u2019 imagination supply no reason to ignore the law\u2019s demands.\nWhen the express terms of a statute give us one answer and\nextratextual considerations suggest another, it\u2019s no contest. Only\nthe written word is the law, and all persons are entitled to its\nbenefit.IFew facts are needed to appreciate the legal\nquestion we face. Each of the three cases before us started the\nsame way: An employer fired a long-time employee shortly after the\nemployee revealed that he or she is homosexual or transgender\u2014and\nallegedly for no reason other than the employee\u2019s homosexuality or\ntransgender status.Gerald Bostock worked for Clayton County,\nGeorgia, as a child welfare advocate. Under his leadership, the\ncounty won national awards for its work. After a decade with the\ncounty, Mr. Bostock began participating in a gay recreational\nsoftball league. Not long after that, influential members of the\ncommunity allegedly made disparaging comments about Mr. Bostock\u2019s\nsexual orientation and participation in the league. Soon, he was\nfired for conduct \u201cunbecoming\u201d a county employee.Donald Zarda worked as a skydiving instructor at\nAltitude Express in New York. After several seasons with the\ncompany, Mr. Zarda mentioned that he was gay and, days later, was\nfired.Aimee Stephens worked at R. G. & G. R.\nHarris Funeral Homes in Garden City, Michigan. When she got the\njob, Ms. Stephens presented as a male. But two years into her\nservice with the company, she began treatment for despair and\nloneliness. Ultimately, clinicians diagnosed her with gender\ndysphoria and recommended that she begin living as a woman. In her\nsixth year with the company, Ms. Stephens wrote a letter to her\nemployer explaining that she planned to \u201c\u00a0live and work\nfull-time as a woman\u201d after she returned from an upcoming vacation.\nThe funeral home fired her before she left, telling her \u201cthis is\nnot going to work out.\u201dWhile these cases began the same way, they ended\ndifferently. Each employee brought suit under Title VII alleging\nunlawful discrimination on the basis of sex. 78Stat. 255, 42\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72000e\u20132(a)(1). In Mr. Bostock\u2019s case, the\nEleventh Circuit held that the law does not prohibit employers from\nfiring employees for being gay and so his suit could be dismissed\nas a matter of law. 723 Fed. Appx. 964 (2018). Meanwhile, in Mr.\nZarda\u2019s case, the Second Circuit concluded that sexual orientation\ndiscrimination does violate Title VII and allowed his case to\nproceed. 883 F.3d 100 (2018). Ms. Stephens\u2019s case has a more\ncomplex procedural history, but in the end the Sixth Circuit\nreached a decision along the same lines as the Second Circuit\u2019s,\nholding that Title VII bars employers from firing employees because\nof their transgender status. 884 F.3d 560 (2018). During the course\nof the proceedings in these long-running disputes, both Mr. Zarda\nand Ms. Stephens have passed away. But their estates continue to\npress their causes for the benefit of their heirs. And we granted\ncertiorari in these matters to resolve at last the disagreement\namong the courts of appeals over the scope of Title VII\u2019s\nprotections for homosexual and transgender persons. 587 U.\u00a0S.\n___ (2019).IIThis Court normally interprets a statute in\naccord with the ordinary public meaning of its terms at the time of\nits enactment. After all, only the words on the page constitute the\nlaw adopted by Congress and approved by the President. If judges\ncould add to, remodel, update, or detract from old statutory terms\ninspired only by extratextual sources and our own imaginations, we\nwould risk amending statutes outside the legislative process\nreserved for the people\u2019s representatives. And we would deny the\npeople the right to continue relying on the original meaning of the\nlaw they have counted on to settle their rights and obligations.\nSeeNew PrimeInc.v.Oliveira, 586 U.\u00a0S.\n___, ___\u2013___ (2019) (slip op., at 6\u20137).With this in mind, our task is clear. We must\ndetermine the ordinary public meaning of Title VII\u2019s command that\nit is \u201cunlawful .\u00a0.\u00a0. for an employer to fail or refuse\nto hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to\ndiscriminate against any individual with respect to his\ncompensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment,\nbecause of such individual\u2019s race, color, religion, sex, or\nnational origin.\u201d \u00a72000e\u20132(a)(1). To do so, we orient ourselves to\nthe time of the statute\u2019s adoption, here 1964, and begin by\nexamining the key statutory terms in turn before assessing their\nimpact on the cases at hand and then confirming our work against\nthis Court\u2019s precedents.AThe only statutorily protected characteristic\nat issue in today\u2019s cases is \u201csex\u201d\u2014and that is also the primary\nterm in Title VII whose meaning the parties dispute. Appealing to\nroughly contemporaneous dictionaries, the employers say that, as\nused here, the term \u201csex\u201d in 1964 referred to \u201cstatus as either\nmale or female [as] determined by reproductive biology.\u201d The\nemployees counter by submitting that, even in 1964, the term bore a\nbroader scope, capturing more than anatomy and reaching at least\nsome norms concerning gender identity and sexual orientation. But\nbecause nothing in our approach to these cases turns on the outcome\nof the parties\u2019 debate, and because the employees concede the point\nfor argument\u2019s sake, we proceed on the assumption that \u201csex\u201d\nsignified what the employers suggest, referring only to biological\ndistinctions between male and female.Still, that\u2019s just a starting point. The\nquestion isn\u2019t just what \u201csex\u201d meant, but what Title VII says about\nit. Most notably, the statute prohibits employers from taking\ncertain actions \u201cbecause of\u00a0\u201d sex. And, as this Court has\npreviously explained, \u201cthe ordinary meaning of \u2018because of\u00a0\u2019\nis \u2018by reason of\u00a0\u2019 or \u2018on account of.\u2019\u00a0\u201dUniversity of\nTex. Southwestern Medical Centerv.Nassar,570 U.S.\n338, 350 (2013) (citingGrossv.FBL Financial\nServices,Inc.,557 U.S.\n167, 176 (2009); quotation altered). In the language of law,\nthis means that Title VII\u2019s \u201cbecause of\u00a0\u201d test incorporates\nthe \u201c\u00a0\u2018simple\u2019\u00a0\u201d and \u201ctraditional\u201d standard of but-for\ncausation.Nassar, 570 U.\u00a0S., at 346, 360. That form of\ncausation is established whenever a particular outcome would not\nhave happened \u201cbut for\u201d the purported cause. SeeGross, 557\nU.\u00a0S., at 176. In other words, a but-for test directs us to\nchange one thing at a time and see if the outcome changes. If it\ndoes, we have found a but-for cause.This can be a sweeping standard. Often, events\nhave multiple but-for causes. So, for example, if a car accident\noccurredbothbecause the defendant ran a red lightandbecause the plaintiff failed to signal his turn at the\nintersection, we might call each a but-for cause of the collision.\nCf.Burragev.United States,571\nU.S. 204, 211\u2013212 (2014). When it comes to Title VII, the\nadoption of the traditional but-for causation standard means a\ndefendant cannot avoid liability just by citing someotherfactor that contributed to its challenged employment decision. So\nlong as the plaintiff\u00a0\u2019s sex was one but-for cause of that\ndecision, that is enough to trigger the law. Seeibid.;Nassar, 570 U.\u00a0S., at 350.No doubt, Congress could have taken a more\nparsimonious approach. As it has in other statutes, it could have\nadded \u201csolely\u201d to indicate that actions taken \u201cbecause of\u00a0\u201d\nthe confluence of multiple factors do not violate the law. Cf. 11\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7525; 16 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7511. Or it could\nhave written \u201cprimarily because of\u00a0\u201d to indicate that the\nprohibited factor had to be the main cause of the defendant\u2019s\nchallenged employment decision. Cf. 22 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72688.\nBut none of this is the law we have. If anything, Congress has\nmoved in the opposite direction, supplementing Title VII in 1991 to\nallow a plaintiff to prevail merely by showing that a protected\ntrait like sex was a \u201cmotivating factor\u201d in a defendant\u2019s\nchallenged employment practice. Civil Rights Act of 1991, \u00a7107,\n105Stat. 1075, codified at 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72000e\u20132(m). Under\nthis more forgiving standard, liability can sometimes follow even\nif sexwasn\u2019ta but-for cause of the employer\u2019s challenged\ndecision. Still, because nothing in our analysis depends on the\nmotivating factor test, we focus on the more traditional but-for\ncausation standard that continues to afford a viable, if no longer\nexclusive, path to relief under Title VII. \u00a72000e\u20132(a)(1).As sweeping as even the but-for causation\nstandard can be, Title VII does not concern itself with everything\nthat happens \u201cbecause of\u00a0\u201d sex. The statute imposes liability\non employers only when they \u201cfail or refuse to hire,\u201d \u201cdischarge,\u201d\n\u201cor otherwise .\u00a0.\u00a0. discriminate against\u201d someone because\nof a statutorily protected characteristic like sex.Ibid.The employers acknowledge that they discharged the plaintiffs in\ntoday\u2019s cases, but assert that the statute\u2019s list of verbs is\nqualified by the last item on it: \u201cotherwise .\u00a0.\u00a0.\ndiscriminate against.\u201d By virtue of the wordotherwise, the\nemployers suggest, Title VII concerns itself not with every\ndischarge, only with those discharges that involve\ndiscrimination.Accepting this point, too, for argument\u2019s sake,\nthe question becomes: What did \u201cdiscriminate\u201d mean in 1964? As it\nturns out, it meant then roughly what it means today: \u201cTo make a\ndifference in treatment or favor (of one as compared with others).\u201d\nWebster\u2019s New International Dictionary 745 (2d ed. 1954). To\n\u201cdiscriminate against\u201d a person, then, would seem to mean treating\nthat individual worse than others who are similarly situated. SeeBurlington N. & S.F.R. Co.v.White,548 U.S.\n53, 59 (2006). In so-called \u201cdisparate treatment\u201d cases like\ntoday\u2019s, this Court has also held that the difference in treatment\nbased on sex must be intentional. See,e.g., Watsonv.Fort Worth Bank & Trust,487 U.S.\n977, 986 (1988). So, taken together, an employer who\nintentionally treats a person worse because of sex\u2014such as by\nfiring the person for actions or attributes it would tolerate in an\nindividual of another sex\u2014discriminates against that person in\nviolation of Title VII.At first glance, another interpretation might\nseem possible. Discrimination sometimes involves \u201cthe act,\npractice, or an instance of discriminating categorically rather\nthan individually.\u201d Webster\u2019s New Collegiate Dictionary 326 (1975);\nsee alsopost,at 27\u201328, n. 22 (Alito, J., dissenting). On\nthat understanding, the statute would require us to consider the\nemployer\u2019s treatment of groups rather than individuals, to see how\na policy affects one sex as a whole versus the other as a whole.\nThat idea holds some intuitive appeal too. Maybe the law concerns\nitself simply with ensuring that employers don\u2019t treat women\ngenerally less favorably than they do men. So how can we tell which\nsense, individual or group, \u201cdiscriminate\u201d carries in Title\nVII?The statute answers that question directly. It\ntells us three times\u2014including immediately after the words\n\u201cdiscriminate against\u201d\u2014that our focus should be on individuals, not\ngroups: Employers may not \u201cfail or refuse to hire or\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. discharge anyindividual, or otherwise\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. discriminate against anyindividualwith\nrespect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of\nemployment, because of suchindividual\u2019s.\u00a0.\u00a0.\nsex.\u201d \u00a72000e\u20132(a)(1) (emphasis added). And the meaning of\n\u201cindividual\u201d was as uncontroversial in 1964 as it is today: \u201cA\nparticular being as distinguished from a class, species, or\ncollection.\u201d Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary, at 1267. Here,\nagain, Congress could have written the law differently. It might\nhave said that \u201cit shall be an unlawful employment practice to\nprefer one sex to the other in hiring, firing, or the terms or\nconditions of employment.\u201d It might have said that there should be\nno \u201csex discrimination,\u201d perhaps implying a focus on differential\ntreatment between the two sexes as groups. More narrowly still, it\ncould have forbidden only \u201csexist policies\u201d against women as a\nclass. But, once again, that is not the law we have.The consequences of the law\u2019s focus on\nindividuals rather than groups are anything but academic. Suppose\nan employer fires a woman for refusing his sexual advances. It\u2019s no\ndefense for the employer to note that, while he treated that\nindividual woman worse than he would have treated a man, he gives\npreferential treatment to female employees overall. The employer is\nliable for treatingthiswoman worse in part because of her\nsex. Nor is it a defense for an employer to say it discriminates\nagainst both men and women because of sex. This statute works to\nprotect individuals of both sexes from discrimination, and does so\nequally. So an employer who fires a woman, Hannah, because she is\ninsufficiently feminine and also fires a man, Bob, for being\ninsufficiently masculine may treat men and women as groups more or\nless equally. But inbothcases the employer fires an\nindividual in part because of sex. Instead of avoiding Title VII\nexposure, this employer doubles it.BFrom the ordinary public meaning of the\nstatute\u2019s language at the time of the law\u2019s adoption, a\nstraightforward rule emerges: An employer violates Title VII when\nit intentionally fires an individual employee based in part on sex.\nIt doesn\u2019t matter if other factors besides the plaintiff\u00a0\u2019s\nsex contributed to the decision. And it doesn\u2019t matter if the\nemployer treated women as a group the same when compared to men as\na group. If the employer intentionally relies in part on an\nindividual employee\u2019s sex when deciding to discharge the\nemployee\u2014put differently, if changing the employee\u2019s sex would have\nyielded a different choice by the employer\u2014a statutory violation\nhas occurred. Title VII\u2019s message is \u201csimple but momentous\u201d: An\nindividual employee\u2019s sex is \u201cnot relevant to the selection,\nevaluation, or compensation of employees.\u201dPrice Waterhousev.Hopkins,490 U.S.\n228, 239 (1989) (plurality opinion).The statute\u2019s message for our cases is equally\nsimple and momentous: An individual\u2019s homosexuality or transgender\nstatus is not relevant to employment decisions. That\u2019s because it\nis impossible to discriminate against a person for being homosexual\nor transgender without discriminating against that individual based\non sex. Consider, for example, an employer with two employees, both\nof whom are attracted to men. The two individuals are, to the\nemployer\u2019s mind, materially identical in all respects, except that\none is a man and the other a woman. If the employer fires the male\nemployee for no reason other than the fact he is attracted to men,\nthe employer discriminates against him for traits or actions it\ntolerates in his female colleague. Put differently, the employer\nintentionally singles out an employee to fire based in part on the\nemployee\u2019s sex, and the affected employee\u2019s sex is a but-for cause\nof his discharge. Or take an employer who fires a transgender\nperson who was identified as a male at birth but who now identifies\nas a female. If the employer retains an otherwise identical\nemployee who was identified as female at birth, the employer\nintentionally penalizes a person identified as male at birth for\ntraits or actions that it tolerates in an employee identified as\nfemale at birth. Again, the individual employee\u2019s sex plays an\nunmistakable and impermissible role in the discharge decision.That distinguishes these cases from countless\nothers where Title VII has nothing to say. Take an employer who\nfires a female employee for tardiness or incompetence or simply\nsupporting the wrong sports team. Assuming the employer would not\nhave tolerated the same trait in a man, Title VII stands silent.\nBut unlike any of these other traits or actions, homosexuality and\ntransgender status are inextricably bound up with sex. Not because\nhomosexuality or transgender status are related to sex in some\nvague sense or because discrimination on these bases has some\ndisparate impact on one sex or another, but because to discriminate\non these grounds requires an employer to intentionally treat\nindividual employees differently because of their sex.Nor does it matter that, when an employer treats\none employee worse because of that individual\u2019s sex, other factors\nmay contribute to the decision. Consider an employer with a policy\nof firing any woman he discovers to be a Yankees fan. Carrying out\nthat rule because an employee is a womananda fan of the\nYankees is a firing \u201cbecause of sex\u201d if the employer would have\ntolerated the same allegiance in a male employee. Likewise here.\nWhen an employer fires an employee because she is homosexual or\ntransgender, two causal factors may be in play\u2014boththe\nindividual\u2019s sexandsomething else (the sex to which the\nindividual is attracted or with which the individual identifies).\nBut Title VII doesn\u2019t care. If an employer would not have\ndischarged an employee but for that individual\u2019s sex, the statute\u2019s\ncausation standard is met, and liability may attach.Reframing the additional causes in today\u2019s cases\nas additional intentions can do no more to insulate the employers\nfrom liability. Intentionally burning down a neighbor\u2019s house is\narson, even if the perpetrator\u2019s ultimate intention (or motivation)\nis only to improve the view. No less, intentional discrimination\nbased on sex violates Title VII, even if it is intended only as a\nmeans to achieving the employer\u2019s ultimate goal of discriminating\nagainst homosexual or transgender employees. There is simply no\nescaping the role intent plays here: Just as sex is necessarily a\nbut-forcausewhen an employer discriminates against\nhomosexual or transgender employees, an employer who discriminates\non these grounds inescapablyintendsto rely on sex in its\ndecisionmaking. Imagine an employer who has a policy of firing any\nemployee known to be homosexual. The employer hosts an office\nholiday party and invites employees to bring their spouses. A model\nemployee arrives and introduces a manager to Susan, the employee\u2019s\nwife. Will that employee be fired? If the policy works as the\nemployer intends, the answer depends entirely on whether the model\nemployee is a man or a woman. To be sure, that employer\u2019s ultimate\ngoal might be to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation.\nBut to achieve that purpose the employer must, along the way,\nintentionally treat an employee worse based in part on that\nindividual\u2019s sex.An employer musters no better a defense by\nresponding that it is equally happy to fire maleandfemale\nemployees who are homosexual or transgender. Title VII liability is\nnot limited to employers who, through the sum of all of their\nemployment actions, treat the class of men differently than the\nclass of women. Instead, the law makes each instance of\ndiscriminating against an individual employee because of that\nindividual\u2019s sex an independent violation of Title VII. So just as\nan employer who fires both Hannah and Bob for failing to fulfill\ntraditional sex stereotypes doubles rather than eliminates Title\nVII liability, an employer who fires both Hannah and Bob for being\ngay or transgender does the same.At bottom, these cases involve no more than the\nstraightforward application of legal terms with plain and settled\nmeanings. For an employer to discriminate against employees for\nbeing homosexual or transgender, the employer must intentionally\ndiscriminate against individual men and women in part because of\nsex. That has always been prohibited by Title VII\u2019s plain terms\u2014and\nthat \u201cshould be the end of the analysis.\u201d 883 F.\u00a03d, at 135\n(Cabranes, J., concurring in judgment).CIf more support for our conclusion were\nrequired, there\u2019s no need to look far. All that the statute\u2019s plain\nterms suggest, this Court\u2019s cases have already confirmed. Consider\nthree of our leading precedents.InPhillipsv.Martin Marietta\nCorp.,400 U.S.\n542(1971) (per\u00a0curiam), a company allegedly\nrefused to hire women with young children, but did hire men with\nchildren the same age. Because its discrimination depended not only\non the employee\u2019s sex as a female but also on the presence of\nanother criterion\u2014namely, being a parent of young children\u2014the\ncompany contended it hadn\u2019t engaged in discrimination \u201cbecause\nof\u00a0\u201d sex. The company maintained, too, that it hadn\u2019t violated\nthe law because, as a whole, it tended to favor hiring women over\nmen. Unsurprisingly by now, these submissions did not sway the\nCourt. That an employer discriminates intentionally against an\nindividual only in part because of sex supplies no defense to Title\nVII. Nor does the fact an employer may happen to favor women as a\nclass.InLos Angeles Dept. of Water and Powerv.Manhart,435 U.S.\n702(1978), an employer required women to make larger pension\nfund contributions than men. The employer sought to justify its\ndisparate treatment on the ground that women tend to live longer\nthan men, and thus are likely to receive more from the pension fund\nover time. By everyone\u2019s admission, the employer was not guilty of\nanimosity against women or a \u201cpurely habitual assumptio[n] about a\nwoman\u2019s inability to perform certain kinds of work\u201d; instead, it\nrelied on what appeared to be a statistically accurate statement\nabout life expectancy.Id., at 707\u2013708. Even so, the Court\nrecognized, a rule that appears evenhanded at the group level can\nprove discriminatory at the level of individuals. True, women as a\nclass may live longer than men as a class. But \u201c[t]he statute\u2019s\nfocus on the individual is unambiguous,\u201d and any individual woman\nmight make the larger pension contributions and still die as early\nas a man.Id., at 708. Likewise, the Court dismissed as\nirrelevant the employer\u2019s insistence that its actions were\nmotivated by a wish to achieve classwide equality between the\nsexes: An employer\u2019s intentional discrimination on the basis of sex\nis no more permissible when it is prompted by some further\nintention (or motivation), even one as prosaic as seeking to\naccount for actuarial tables.Ibid.The employer violated\nTitle VII because, when its policy worked exactly as planned, it\ncould not \u201cpass the simple test\u201d asking whether an individual\nfemale employee would have been treated the same regardless of her\nsex.Id., at 711.InOncalev.Sundowner Offshore\nServices, Inc.,523 U.S.\n75(1998), a male plaintiff alleged that he was singled out by\nhis male co-workers for sexual harassment. The Court held it was\nimmaterial that members of the same sex as the victim committed the\nalleged discrimination. Nor did the Court concern itself with\nwhether men as a group were subject to discrimination or whether\nsomething in addition to sex contributed to the discrimination,\nlike the plaintiff\u00a0\u2019s conduct or personal attributes.\n\u201c[A]ssuredly,\u201d the case didn\u2019t involve \u201cthe principal evil Congress\nwas concerned with when it enacted Title VII.\u201dId., at 79.\nBut, the Court unanimously explained, it is \u201cthe provisions of our\nlaws rather than the principal concerns of our legislators by which\nwe are governed.\u201dIbid.Because the plaintiff alleged that\nthe harassment would not have taken place but for his sex\u2014that is,\nthe plaintiff would not have suffered similar treatment if he were\nfemale\u2014a triable Title VII claim existed.The lessons these cases hold for ours are by now\nfamiliar.First, it\u2019s irrelevant what an employer might\ncall its discriminatory practice, how others might label it, or\nwhat else might motivate it. InManhart, the employer called\nits rule requiring women to pay more into the pension fund a \u201clife\nexpectancy\u201d adjustment necessary to achieve sex equality. InPhillips, the employer could have accurately spoken of its\npolicy as one based on \u201cmotherhood.\u201d In much the same way, today\u2019s\nemployers might describe their actions as motivated by their\nemployees\u2019 homosexuality or transgender status. But just as labels\nand additional intentions or motivations didn\u2019t make a difference\ninManhartorPhillips, they cannot make a difference\nhere. When an employer fires an employee for being homosexual or\ntransgender, it necessarily and intentionally discriminates against\nthat individual in part because of sex. And that is all Title VII\nhas ever demanded to establish liability.Second, the plaintiff\u00a0\u2019s sex need not be\nthe sole or primary cause of the employer\u2019s adverse action. InPhillips,Manhart, andOncale, the defendant\neasily could have pointed to some other, nonprotected trait and\ninsisted it was the more important factor in the adverse employment\noutcome. So, too, it has no significance here if another\nfactor\u2014such as the sex the plaintiff\u00a0is attracted to or\npresents as\u2014might also be at work, or even play a more important\nrole in the employer\u2019s decision.Finally, an employer cannot escape liability by\ndemonstrating that it treats males and females comparably as\ngroups. AsManhartteaches, an employer is liable for\nintentionally requiring an individual female employee to pay more\ninto a pension plan than a male counterpart even if the scheme\npromotes equality at the group level. Likewise, an employer who\nintentionally fires an individual homosexual or transgender\nemployee in part because of that individual\u2019s sex violates the law\neven if the employer is willing to subject all male and female\nhomosexual or transgender employees to the same rule.IIIWhat do the employers have to say in reply?\nFor present purposes, they do not dispute that they fired the\nplaintiffs for being homosexual or transgender. Sorting out the\ntrue reasons for an adverse employment decision is often a hard\nbusiness, but none of that is at issue here. Rather, the employers\nsubmit that even intentional discrimination against employees based\non their homosexuality or transgender status supplies no basis for\nliability under Title VII.The employers\u2019 argument proceeds in two stages.\nSeeking footing in the statutory text, they begin by advancing a\nnumber of reasons why discrimination on the basis of homosexuality\nor transgender status doesn\u2019t involve discrimination because of\nsex. But each of these arguments turns out only to repackage errors\nwe\u2019ve already seen and this Court\u2019s precedents have already\nrejected. In the end, the employers are left to retreat beyond the\nstatute\u2019s text, where they fault us for ignoring the legislature\u2019s\npurposes in enacting Title VII or certain expectations about its\noperation. They warn, too, about consequences that might follow a\nruling for the employees. But none of these contentions about what\nthe employers think the law was meant to do, or should do, allow us\nto ignore the law as it is.AMaybe most intuitively, the employers assert\nthat discrimination on the basis of homosexuality and transgender\nstatus aren\u2019t referred to as sex discrimination in ordinary\nconversation. If asked by a friend (rather than a judge) why they\nwere fired, even today\u2019s plaintiffs would likely respond that it\nwas because they were gay or transgender, not because of sex.\nAccording to the employers, that conversational answer, not the\nstatute\u2019s strict terms, should guide our thinking and suffice to\ndefeat any suggestion that the employees now before us were fired\nbecause of sex. Cf.post,at 3 (Alito, J., dissenting);post,at 8\u201313 (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting).But this submission rests on a mistaken\nunderstanding of what kind of cause the law is looking for in a\nTitle VII case. In conversation, a speaker is likely to focus on\nwhat seems most relevant or informative to the listener. So an\nemployee who has just been fired is likely to identify the primary\nor most direct cause rather than list literally every but-for\ncause. To do otherwise would be tiring at best. But these\nconversational conventions do not control Title VII\u2019s legal\nanalysis, which asks simply whether sex was a but-for cause. InPhillips, for example, a woman who was not hired under the\nemployer\u2019s policy might have told her friends that her application\nwas rejected because she was a mother, or because she had young\nchildren. Given that many women could be hired under the policy,\nit\u2019s unlikely she would say she was not hired because she was a\nwoman. But the Court did not hesitate to recognize that the\nemployer inPhillipsdiscriminated against the plaintiff\nbecause of her sex. Sex wasn\u2019t the only factor, or maybe even the\nmain factor, but it was one but-for cause\u2014and that was enough. You\ncan call the statute\u2019s but-for causation test what you\nwill\u2014expansive, legalistic, the dissents even dismiss it as wooden\nor literal. But it is the law.Trying another angle, the defendants before us\nsuggest that an employer who discriminates based on homosexuality\nor transgender status doesn\u2019tintentionallydiscriminate\nbased on sex, as a disparate treatment claim requires. Seepost, at 9\u201312 (Alito, J., dissenting);post, at 12\u201313\n(Kavanaugh, J., dissenting). But, as we\u2019ve seen, an employer who\ndiscriminates against homosexual or transgender employees\nnecessarily and intentionally applies sex-based rules. An employer\nthat announces it will not employ anyone who is homosexual, for\nexample, intends to penalize male employees for being attracted to\nmen and female employees for being attracted to women.What, then, do the employers mean when they\ninsist intentional discrimination based on homosexuality or\ntransgender status isn\u2019t intentional discrimination based on sex?\nMaybe the employers mean they don\u2019t intend to harm one sex or the\nother as a class. But as should be clear by now, the statute\nfocuses on discrimination against individuals, not groups.\nAlternatively, the employers may mean that they don\u2019t perceive\nthemselves as motivated by a desire to discriminate based on sex.\nBut nothing in Title VII turns on the employer\u2019s labels or any\nfurther intentions (or motivations) for its conduct beyond sex\ndiscrimination. InManhart, the employer intentionally\nrequired women to make higher pension contributions only to fulfill\nthe further purpose of making things more equitable between men and\nwomen as groups. InPhillips, the employer may have\nperceived itself as discriminating based on motherhood, not sex,\ngiven that its hiring policies as a wholefavoredwomen. But\nin both cases, the Court set all this aside as irrelevant. The\nemployers\u2019 policies involved intentional discrimination because of\nsex, and Title VII liability necessarily followed.Aren\u2019t these cases different, the employers ask,\ngiven that an employer could refuse to hire a gay or transgender\nindividual without ever learning the applicant\u2019s sex? Suppose an\nemployer asked homosexual or transgender applicants to tick a box\non its application form. The employer then had someone else redact\nany information that could be used to discern sex. The resulting\napplications would disclose which individuals are homosexual or\ntransgender without revealing whether they also happen to be men or\nwomen. Doesn\u2019t that possibility indicate that the employer\u2019s\ndiscrimination against homosexual or transgender persons cannot be\nsex discrimination?No, it doesn\u2019t. Even in this example, the\nindividual applicant\u2019s sex still weighs as a factor in the\nemployer\u2019s decision. Change the hypothetical ever so slightly and\nits flaws become apparent. Suppose an employer\u2019s application form\noffered a single box to check if the applicant is either black or\nCatholic. If the employer refuses to hire anyone who checks that\nbox, would we conclude the employer has complied with Title VII, so\nlong as it studiously avoids learning any particular applicant\u2019s\nrace or religion? Of course not: By intentionally setting out a\nrule that makes hiring turn on race or religion, the employer\nviolates the law, whatever he might know or not know about\nindividual applicants.The same holds here. There is no way for an\napplicant to decide whether to check the homosexual or transgender\nbox without considering sex. To see why, imagine an applicant\ndoesn\u2019t know what the words homosexual or transgender mean. Then\ntry writing out instructions for who should check the box without\nusing the words man, woman, or sex (or some synonym). It can\u2019t be\ndone. Likewise, there is no way an employer can discriminate\nagainst those who check the homosexual or transgender box without\ndiscriminating in part because of an applicant\u2019s sex. By\ndiscriminating against homosexuals, the employer intentionally\npenalizes men for being attracted to men and women for being\nattracted to women. By discriminating against transgender persons,\nthe employer unavoidably discriminates against persons with one sex\nidentified at birth and another today. Any way you slice it, the\nemployer intentionally refuses to hire applicants in part because\nof the affected individuals\u2019 sex, even if it never learns any\napplicant\u2019s sex.Next, the employers turn to Title VII\u2019s list of\nprotected characteristics\u2014race, color, religion, sex, and national\norigin. Because homosexuality and transgender status can\u2019t be found\non that list and because they are conceptually distinct from sex,\nthe employers reason, they are implicitly excluded from Title VII\u2019s\nreach. Put another way, if Congress had wanted to address these\nmatters in Title VII, it would have referenced them specifically.\nCf.post,at 7\u20138 (Alito, J., dissenting);post,at\n13\u201315 (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting).But that much does not follow. We agree that\nhomosexuality and transgender status are distinct concepts from\nsex. But, as we\u2019ve seen, discrimination based on homosexuality or\ntransgender status necessarily entails discrimination based on sex;\nthe first cannot happen without the second. Nor is there any such\nthing as a \u201ccanon of donut holes,\u201d in which Congress\u2019s failure to\nspeak directly to a specific case that falls within a more general\nstatutory rule creates a tacit exception. Instead, when Congress\nchooses not to include any exceptions to a broad rule, courts apply\nthe broad rule. And that is exactly how this Court has always\napproached Title VII. \u201cSexual harassment\u201d is conceptually distinct\nfrom sex discrimination, but it can fall within Title VII\u2019s sweep.Oncale, 523 U.\u00a0S., at 79\u201380. Same with \u201cmotherhood\ndiscrimination.\u201d SeePhillips, 400 U.\u00a0S., at 544. Would\nthe employers have us reverse those cases on the theory that\nCongress could have spoken to those problems more specifically? Of\ncourse not. As enacted, Title VII prohibits all forms of\ndiscrimination because of sex, however they may manifest themselves\nor whatever other labels might attach to them.The employers try the same point another way.\nSince 1964, they observe, Congress has considered several proposals\nto add sexual orientation to Title VII\u2019s list of protected\ncharacteristics, but no such amendment has become law. Meanwhile,\nCongress has enacted other statutes addressing other topics that do\ndiscuss sexual orientation. This postenactment legislative history,\nthey urge, should tell us something. Cf.post, at 2, 42\u201343\n(Alito, J., dissenting);post, at 4, 15\u201316 (Kavanaugh, J.,\ndissenting).But what? There\u2019s no authoritative evidence\nexplaining why later Congresses adopted other laws referencing\nsexual orientation but didn\u2019t amend this one. Maybe some in the\nlater legislatures understood the impact Title VII\u2019s broad language\nalready promised for cases like ours and didn\u2019t think a revision\nneeded. Maybe others knew about its impact but hoped no one else\nwould notice. Maybe still others, occupied by other concerns,\ndidn\u2019t consider the issue at all. All we can know for certain is\nthat speculation about why a later Congress declined to adopt new\nlegislation offers a \u201cparticularly dangerous\u201d basis on which to\nrest an interpretation of an existing law a different and earlier\nCongress did adopt.Pension Benefit GuarantyCorporationv.LTV Corp.,496\nU.S. 633, 650 (1990); see alsoUnited Statesv.Wells,519 U.S.\n482, 496 (1997);Sullivanv.Finkelstein,496 U.S.\n617, 632 (1990) (Scalia, J., concurring) (\u201cArguments based on\nsubsequent legislative history .\u00a0.\u00a0. should not be taken\nseriously, not even in a footnote\u201d).That leaves the employers to seek a different\nsort of exception. Maybe the traditional and simple but-for\ncausation test should apply in all other Title VII cases, but it\njust doesn\u2019t work when it comes to cases involving homosexual and\ntransgender employees. The test is too blunt to capture the nuances\nhere. The employers illustrate their concern with an example. When\nwe apply the simple test to Mr. Bostock\u2014asking whether Mr. Bostock,\na man attracted to other men, would have been fired had he been a\nwoman\u2014we don\u2019t just change his sex. Along the way, we change his\nsexual orientation too (from homosexual to heterosexual). If the\naim is to isolate whether a plaintiff\u00a0\u2019s sex caused the\ndismissal, the employers stress, we must hold sexual orientation\nconstant\u2014meaning we need to change both his sex and the sex to\nwhich he is attracted. So for Mr. Bostock, the question should be\nwhether he would\u2019ve been fired if he were a woman attracted to\nwomen. And because his employer would have been as quick to fire a\nlesbian as it was a gay man, the employers conclude, no Title VII\nviolation has occurred.While the explanation is new, the mistakes are\nthe same. The employers might be onto something if Title VII only\nensured equal treatment between groups of men and women or if the\nstatute applied only when sex is the sole or primary reason for an\nemployer\u2019s challenged adverse employment action. But both of these\npremises are mistaken. Title VII\u2019s plain terms and our precedents\ndon\u2019t care if an employer treats men and women comparably as\ngroups; an employer who fires both lesbians and gay men equally\ndoesn\u2019t diminish but doubles its liability. Just cast a glance back\ntoManhart, where it was no defense that the employer sought\nto equalize pension contributions based on life expectancy. Nor\ndoes the statute care if other factors besides sex contribute to an\nemployer\u2019s discharge decision. Mr. Bostock\u2019s employer might have\ndecided to fire him only because of the confluence of two factors,\nhis sex and the sex to which he is attracted. But exactly the same\nmight have been said inPhillips, where motherhood was the\nadded variable.Still, the employers insist, something seems\ndifferent here. Unlike certain other employment policies this Court\nhas addressed that harmed only women or only men, the employers\u2019\npolicies in the cases before us have the same adverse consequences\nfor men and women. How could sex be necessary to the result if a\nmember of the opposite sex might face the same outcome from the\nsame policy?What the employers see as unique isn\u2019t even\nunusual. Often in life and law two but-for factors combine to yield\na result that could have also occurred in some other way. Imagine\nthat it\u2019s a nice day outside and your house is too warm, so you\ndecide to open the window. Both the cool temperature outside and\nthe heat inside are but-for causes of your choice to open the\nwindow. That doesn\u2019t change just because you also would have opened\nthe window had it been warm outside and cold inside. In either\ncase, no one would deny that the window is open \u201cbecause of\u00a0\u201d\nthe outside temperature. Our cases are much the same. So, for\nexample, when it comes to homosexual employees, male sex and\nattraction to men are but-for factors that can combine to get them\nfired. The fact that female sex and attraction to women canalsoget an employee fired does no more than show the same\noutcome can be achieved through the combination of different\nfactors. In either case, though, sex plays an essential but-for\nrole.At bottom, the employers\u2019 argument unavoidably\ncomes down to a suggestion that sex must be the sole or primary\ncause of an adverse employment action for Title VII liability to\nfollow. And, as we\u2019ve seen, that suggestion is at odds with\neverything we know about the statute. Consider an employer eager to\nrevive the workplace gender roles of the 1950s. He enforces a\npolicy that he will hire only men as mechanics and only women as\nsecretaries. When a qualified woman applies for a mechanic position\nand is denied, the \u201csimple test\u201d immediately spots the\ndiscrimination: A qualified man would have been given the job, so\nsex was a but-for cause of the employer\u2019s refusal to hire. But like\nthe employers before us today, this employer would say not so fast.\nBy comparing the woman who applied to be a mechanic to a man who\napplied to be a mechanic, we\u2019ve quietly changed two things: the\napplicant\u2019s sex and her trait of failing to conform to 1950s gender\nroles. The \u201csimple test\u201d thus overlooks that it is really the\napplicant\u2019s bucking of 1950s gender roles, not her sex, doing the\nwork. So we need to hold that second trait constant: Instead of\ncomparing the disappointed female applicant to a man who applied\nfor the same position, the employer would say, we should compare\nher to a man who applied to be a secretary. And because that\njobseeker would be refused too, this must not be sex\ndiscrimination.No one thinksthat, so the employers must\nscramble to justify deploying a stricter causation test for use\nonly in cases involving discrimination based on sexual orientation\nor transgender status. Such a rule would create a curious\ndiscontinuity in our case law, to put it mildly. Employer hires\nbased on sexual stereotypes? Simple test. Employer sets pension\ncontributions based on sex? Simple test. Employer fires men who do\nnot behave in a sufficiently masculine way around the office?\nSimple test. But when that same employer discriminates against\nwomen who are attracted to women, or persons identified at birth as\nwomen who later identify as men, we suddenly roll out a new and\nmore rigorous standard? Why arethesereasons for taking sex\ninto account different from all the rest? Title VII\u2019s text can\noffer no answer.BUltimately, the employers are forced to\nabandon the statutory text and precedent altogether and appeal to\nassumptions and policy. Most pointedly, they contend that few in\n1964 would have expected Title VII to apply to discrimination\nagainst homosexual and transgender persons. And whatever the text\nand our precedent indicate, they say, shouldn\u2019t this fact cause us\nto pause before recognizing liability?It might be tempting to reject this argument out\nof hand. This Court has explained many times over many years that,\nwhen the meaning of the statute\u2019s terms is plain, our job is at an\nend. The people are entitled to rely on the law as written, without\nfearing that courts might disregard its plain terms based on some\nextratextual consideration. See,e.g.,Carcieriv.Salazar,555 U.S.\n379, 387 (2009);Connecticut Nat. Bankv.Germain,503 U.S.\n249, 253\u2013254 (1992);Rubinv.United States,449 U.S.\n424, 430 (1981). Of course, some Members of this Court have\nconsulted legislative history when interpretingambiguousstatutory language. Cf.post, at 40 (Alito,\u00a0J.,\ndissenting). But that has no bearing here. \u201cLegislative history,\nfor those who take it into account, is meant to clear up ambiguity,\nnot create it.\u201dMilnerv.Department of Navy,562 U.S.\n562, 574 (2011). And as we have seen, no ambiguity exists about\nhow Title VII\u2019s terms apply to the facts before us. To be sure, the\nstatute\u2019s application in these cases reaches \u201cbeyond the principal\nevil\u201d legislators may have intended or expected to address.Oncale, 523 U.\u00a0S., at 79. But \u201c\u00a0\u2018the fact that [a\nstatute] has been applied in situations not expressly anticipated\nby Congress\u2019\u00a0\u201d does not demonstrate ambiguity; instead, it\nsimply \u201c\u00a0\u2018demonstrates [the] breadth\u2019\u00a0\u201d of a legislative\ncommand.Sedima,S. P. R. L.v.Imrex Co.,473 U.S.\n479, 499 (1985). And \u201cit is ultimately the provisions of\u00a0\u201d\nthose legislative commands \u201crather than the principal concerns of\nour legislators by which we are governed.\u201dOncale, 523\nU.\u00a0S., at 79; see also A. Scalia & B. Garner, Reading Law:\nThe Interpretation of Legal Texts 101 (2012) (noting that\nunexpected applications of broad language reflect only Congress\u2019s\n\u201cpresumed point [to] produce general coverage\u2014not to leave room for\ncourts to recognize ad hoc exceptions\u201d).Still, while legislative history can never\ndefeat unambiguous statutory text, historical sources can be useful\nfor a different purpose: Because the law\u2019s ordinary meaning at the\ntime of enactment usually governs, we must be sensitive to the\npossibility a statutory term that means one thing today or in one\ncontext might have meant something else at the time of its adoption\nor might mean something different in another context. And we must\nbe attuned to the possibility that a statutory phrase ordinarily\nbears a different meaning than the terms do when viewed\nindividually or literally. To ferret out such shifts in linguistic\nusage or subtle distinctions between literal and ordinary meaning,\nthis Court has sometimes consulted the understandings of the law\u2019s\ndrafters as some (not always conclusive) evidence. For example, in\nthe context of the National Motor Vehicle Theft Act, this Court\nadmitted that the term \u201cvehicle\u201d in 1931 could literally mean \u201ca\nconveyance working on land, water or air.\u201dMcBoylev.United States,283 U.S.\n25, 26 (1931). But given contextual clues and \u201ceveryday speech\u201d\nat the time of the Act\u2019s adoption in 1919, this Court concluded\nthat \u201cvehicles\u201d in that statute included only things \u201cmoving on\nland,\u201d not airplanes too.Ibid. Similarly, inNew\nPrime, we held that, while the term \u201ccontracts of employment\u201d\ntoday might seem to encompass only contracts with employees, at the\ntime of the statute\u2019s adoption the phrase was ordinarily understood\nto cover contracts with independent contractors as well. 586\nU.\u00a0S., at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 6\u20139). Cf.post,at 7\u20138\n(Kavanaugh, J., dissenting) (providing additional examples).The employers, however, advocate nothing like\nthat here. They do not seek to use historical sources to illustrate\nthat the meaning of any of Title VII\u2019s language has changed since\n1964 or that the statute\u2019s terms, whether viewed individually or as\na whole, ordinarily carried some message we have missed. To the\ncontrary, as we have seen, the employersagreewith our\nunderstanding of all the statutory language\u2014\u201cdiscriminate against\nany individual .\u00a0.\u00a0. because of such individual\u2019s\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. sex.\u201d Nor do the competing dissents offer an\nalternative account about what these terms mean either when viewed\nindividually or in the aggregate. Rather than suggesting that the\nstatutory language bears some othermeaning, the employers\nand dissents merely suggest that, because few in 1964 expected\ntoday\u2019sresult, we should not dare to admit that it follows\nineluctably from the statutory text. When a new application emerges\nthat is both unexpected and important, they would seemingly have us\nmerely point out the question, refer the subject back to Congress,\nand decline to enforce the plain terms of the law in the\nmeantime.That is exactly the sort of reasoning this Court\nhas long rejected. Admittedly, the employers take pains to couch\ntheir argument in terms of seeking to honor the statute\u2019s \u201cexpected\napplications\u201d rather than vindicate its \u201clegislative intent.\u201d But\nthe concepts are closely related. One could easily contend that\nlegislators only intended expected applications or that a statute\u2019s\npurpose is limited to achieving applications foreseen at the time\nof enactment. However framed, the employer\u2019s logic impermissibly\nseeks to displace the plain meaning of the law in favor of\nsomething lying beyond it.If anything, the employers\u2019 new framing may only\nadd new problems. The employers assert that \u201cno one\u201d in 1964 or for\nsome time after would have anticipated today\u2019s result. But is that\nreally true? Not long after the law\u2019s passage, gay and transgender\nemployees began filing Title VII complaints, so at leastsomepeople foresaw this potential application. See,e.g.,Smithv.Liberty Mut. Ins. Co.,395 F. Supp. 1098, 1099 (ND Ga. 1975) (addressing claim from\n1969);Hollowayv.Arthur Andersen & Co., 566\nF.2d 659, 661 (CA9 1977) (addressing claim from 1974). And less\nthan a decade after Title VII\u2019s passage, during debates over the\nEqual Rights Amendment, others counseled that its language\u2014which\nwas strikingly similar to Title VII\u2019s\u2014might also protect\nhomosexuals from discrimination. See,e.g., Note, The\nLegality of Homosexual Marriage, 82 Yale L. J. 573, 583\u2013584\n(1973).Why isn\u2019t that enough to demonstrate that\ntoday\u2019s result isn\u2019t totally unexpected? How many people have to\nforesee the application for it to qualify as \u201cexpected\u201d? Do we look\nonly at the moment the statute was enacted, or do we allow some\ntime for the implications of a new statute to be worked out? Should\nwe consider the expectations of those who had no reason to give a\nparticular application any thought or only those with reason to\nthink about the question? How do we account for those who change\ntheir minds over time, after learning new facts or hearing a new\nargument? How specifically or generally should we frame the\n\u201capplication\u201d at issue? None of these questions have obvious\nanswers, and the employers don\u2019t propose any.One could also reasonably fear that objections\nabout unexpected applications will not be deployed neutrally. Often\nlurking just behind such objections resides a cynicism that\nCongress could notpossiblyhave meant to protect a\ndisfavored group. Take this Court\u2019s encounter with the Americans\nwith Disabilities Act\u2019s directive that no \u201c\u00a0\u2018public\nentity\u2019\u00a0\u201d can discriminate against any \u201c\u00a0\u2018qualified\nindividual with a disability.\u2019\u00a0\u201dPennsylvania Dept.of Correctionsv.Yeskey,524\nU.S. 206, 208 (1998). Congress, of course, didn\u2019t list every\npublic entity the statute would apply to. And no one batted an eye\nat its application to, say, post offices. But when the statute was\napplied toprisons, curiously, some demanded a closer look:\nPennsylvania argued that \u201cCongress did not \u2018envisio[n] that the ADA\nwould be applied to state prisoners.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId., at\n211\u2013212. This Court emphatically rejected that view, explaining\nthat, \u201cin the context of an unambiguous statutory text,\u201d whether a\nspecific application was anticipated by Congress \u201cis irrelevant.\u201dId., at 212. AsYeskeyand today\u2019s cases exemplify,\napplying protective laws to groups that were politically unpopular\nat the time of the law\u2019s passage\u2014whether prisoners in the 1990s or\nhomosexual and transgender employees in the 1960s\u2014often may be seen\nas unexpected. But to refuse enforcement just because of that,\nbecause the parties before us happened to be unpopular at the time\nof the law\u2019s passage, would not only require us to abandon our role\nas interpreters of statutes; it would tilt the scales of justice in\nfavor of the strong or popular and neglect the promise that all\npersons are entitled to the benefit of the law\u2019s terms. Cf.post, at 28\u201335 (Alito, J., dissenting);post,at\n21\u201322 (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting).The employer\u2019s position also proves too much. If\nwe applied Title VII\u2019s plain text only to applications some\n(yet-to-be-determined) group expected in 1964, we\u2019d have more than\na little law to overturn. Start withOncale. How many people\nin 1964 could have expected that the law would turn out to protect\nmale employees? Let alone to protect them from harassment by other\nmale employees? As we acknowledged at the time, \u201cmale-on-male\nsexual harassment in the workplace was assuredly not the principal\nevil Congress was concerned with when it enacted Title VII.\u201d 523\nU.\u00a0S., at 79. Yet the Court did not hesitate to recognize that\nTitle VII\u2019s plain terms forbade it. Under the employer\u2019s logic, it\nwould seem this was a mistake.That\u2019s just the beginning of the law we would\nhave to unravel. As one Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\n(EEOC) Commissioner observed shortly after the law\u2019s passage, the\nwords of \u201c\u00a0\u2018the sex provision of Title VII [are] difficult to\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. control.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Franklin, Inventing the\n\u201cTraditional Concept\u201d of Sex Discrimination, 125 Harv. L. Rev.\n1307, 1338 (2012) (quoting Federal Mediation Service To Play Role\nin Implementing Title VII, [1965\u20131968 Transfer Binder] CCH\nEmployment Practices \u00b68046, p.\u00a06074). The \u201cdifficult[y]\u201d may\nowe something to the initial proponent of the sex discrimination\nrule in Title VII, Representative Howard Smith. On some accounts,\nthe congressman may have wanted (or at least was indifferent to the\npossibility of\u00a0) broad language with wide-ranging effect. Not\nnecessarily because he was interested in rooting out sex\ndiscrimination in all its forms, but because he may have hoped to\nscuttle the whole Civil Rights Act and thought that adding language\ncovering sex discrimination would serve as a poison pill. See C.\nWhalen & B. Whalen, The Longest Debate: A Legislative History\nof the 1964 Civil Rights Act 115\u2013118 (1985). Certainly nothing in\nthe meager legislative history of this provision suggests it was\nmeant to be read narrowly.Whatever his reasons,thanks to the broad\nlanguage Representative Smith introduced, many, maybe most,\napplications of Title VII\u2019s sex provision were \u201cunanticipated\u201d at\nthe time of the law\u2019s adoption. In fact, many now-obvious\napplications met with heated opposition early on, even among those\ntasked with enforcing the law. In the years immediately following\nTitle VII\u2019s passage, the EEOC officially opined that listing men\u2019s\npositions and women\u2019s positions separately in job postings was\nsimply helpful rather than discriminatory. Franklin, 125 Harv. L.\nRev., at 1340 (citing Press Release, EEOC (Sept. 22, 1965)). Some\ncourts held that Title VII did not prevent an employer from firing\nan employee for refusing his sexual advances. See,e.g.,Barnesv.Train, 1974 WL 10628, *1 (D DC, Aug. 9,\n1974). And courts held that a policy against hiring mothers but not\nfathers of young children wasn\u2019t discrimination because of sex. SeePhillipsv.Martin Marietta Corp., 411 F.2d 1 (CA5\n1969), rev\u2019d,400 U.S.\n542(1971) (per\u00a0curiam).Over time, though, the breadth of the statutory\nlanguage proved too difficult to deny. By the end of the 1960s, the\nEEOC reversed its stance on sex-segregated job advertising. See\nFranklin, 125 Harv. L. Rev., at 1345. In 1971, this Court held that\ntreating women with children differently from men with children\nviolated Title VII.Phillips, 400 U.\u00a0S., at 544. And by\nthe late 1970s, courts began to recognize that sexual harassment\ncan sometimes amount to sex discrimination. See,e.g.,Barnesv.Costle, 561 F.2d 983, 990 (CADC 1977).\nWhile to the modern eye each of these examples may seem \u201cplainly\n[to] constitut[e] discrimination because of biological sex,\u201dpost, at 38 (Alito, J., dissenting), all were hotly\ncontested for years following Title VII\u2019s enactment. And as with\nthe discrimination we consider today, many federal judges long\naccepted interpretations of Title VII that excluded these\nsituations. Cf.post, at 21\u201322 (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting)\n(highlighting that certain lower courts have rejected Title VII\nclaims based on homosexuality and transgender status). Would the\nemployers have us undo every one of these unexpected applications\ntoo?The weighty implications of the employers\u2019\nargument from expectations also reveal why they cannot hide behind\nthe no-elephants-in-mouseholes canon. That canon recognizes that\nCongress \u201cdoes not alter the fundamental details of a regulatory\nscheme in vague terms or ancillary provisions.\u201dWhitmanv.American Trucking Assns.,Inc.,531 U.S.\n457, 468 (2001). But it has no relevance here. We can\u2019t deny\nthat today\u2019s holding\u2014that employers are prohibited from firing\nemployees on the basis of homosexuality or transgender status\u2014is an\nelephant. But where\u2019s the mousehole? Title VII\u2019s prohibition of sex\ndiscrimination in employment is a major piece of federal civil\nrights legislation. It is written in starkly broad terms. It has\nrepeatedly produced unexpected applications, at least in the view\nof those on the receiving end of them. Congress\u2019s key drafting\nchoices\u2014to focus on discrimination against individuals and not\nmerely between groups and to hold employers liable whenever sex is\na but-for cause of the plaintiff\u00a0\u2019s injuries\u2014virtually\nguaranteed that unexpected applications would emerge over time.\nThis elephant has never hidden in a mousehole; it has been standing\nbefore us all along.With that, the employers are left to abandon\ntheir concern for expected applications and fall back to the last\nline of defense for all failing statutory interpretation arguments:\nnaked policy appeals. If we were to apply the statute\u2019s plain\nlanguage, they complain, any number of undesirable policy\nconsequences would follow. Cf.post, at 44\u201354 (Alito, J.,\ndissenting). Gone here is any pretense of statutory interpretation;\nall that\u2019s left is a suggestion we should proceed without the law\u2019s\nguidance to do as we think best. But that\u2019s an invitation no court\nshould ever take up. The place to make new legislation, or address\nunwanted consequences of old legislation, lies in Congress. When it\ncomes to statutory interpretation, our role is limited to applying\nthe law\u2019s demands as faithfully as we can in the cases that come\nbefore us. As judges we possess no special expertise or authority\nto declare for ourselves what a self-governing people should\nconsider just or wise. And the same judicial humility that requires\nus to refrain from adding to statutes requires us to refrain from\ndiminishing them.What are these consequences anyway? The\nemployers worry that our decision will sweep beyond Title VII to\nother federal or state laws that prohibit sex discrimination. And,\nunder Title VII itself, they say sex-segregated bathrooms, locker\nrooms, and dress codes will prove unsustainable after our decision\ntoday. But none of these other laws are before us; we have not had\nthe benefit of adversarial testing about the meaning of their\nterms, and we do not prejudge any such question today. Under Title\nVII, too, we do not purport to address bathrooms, locker rooms, or\nanything else of the kind. The only question before us is whether\nan employer who fires someone simply for being homosexual or\ntransgender has discharged or otherwise discriminated against that\nindividual \u201cbecause of such individual\u2019s sex.\u201d As used in Title\nVII, the term \u201c\u00a0\u2018discriminate against\u2019\u00a0\u201d refers to\n\u201cdistinctions or differences in treatment that injure protected\nindividuals.\u201dBurlington N. & S. F. R., 548 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 59. Firing employees because of a statutorily protected trait\nsurely counts. Whether other policies and practices might or might\nnot qualify as unlawful discrimination or find justifications under\nother provisions of Title VII are questions for future cases, not\nthese.Separately, the employers fear that complying\nwith Title VII\u2019s requirement in cases like ours may require some\nemployers to violate their religious convictions. We are also\ndeeply concerned with preserving the promise of the free exercise\nof religion enshrined in our Constitution; that guarantee lies at\nthe heart of our pluralistic society. But worries about how Title\nVII may intersect with religious liberties are nothing new; they\neven predate the statute\u2019s passage. As a result of its\ndeliberations in adopting the law, Congress included an express\nstatutory exception for religious organizations. \u00a72000e\u20131(a). This\nCourt has also recognized that the First Amendment can bar the\napplication of employment discrimination laws \u201cto claims concerning\nthe employment relationship between a religious institution and its\nministers.\u201dHosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church and\nSchoolv.EEOC,565 U.S.\n171, 188 (2012). And Congress has gone a step further yet in\nthe Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA), 107Stat.\n1488, codified at 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72000bbet\u00a0seq.That statute prohibits the federal government from substantially\nburdening a person\u2019s exercise of religion unless it demonstrates\nthat doing so both furthers a compelling governmental interest and\nrepresents the least restrictive means of furthering that interest.\n\u00a72000bb\u20131. Because RFRA operates as a kind of super statute,\ndisplacing the normal operation of other federal laws, it might\nsupersede Title VII\u2019s commands in appropriate cases. See\n\u00a72000bb\u20133.But how these doctrines protecting religious\nliberty interact with Title VII are questions for future cases too.\nHarris Funeral Homes did unsuccessfully pursue a RFRA-based defense\nin the proceedings below. In its certiorari petition, however, the\ncompany declined to seek review of that adverse decision, and no\nother religious liberty claim is now before us. So while other\nemployers in other cases may raise free exercise arguments that\nmerit careful consideration, none of the employers before us today\nrepresent in this Court that compliance with Title VII will\ninfringe their own religious liberties in any way.*Some of those who supported adding language to\nTitle VII to ban sex discrimination may have hoped it would derail\nthe entire Civil Rights Act. Yet, contrary to those intentions, the\nbill became law. Since then, Title VII\u2019s effects have unfolded with\nfar-reaching consequences, some likely beyond what many in Congress\nor elsewhere expected.But none of this helps decide today\u2019s cases.\nOurs is a society of written laws. Judges are not free to overlook\nplain statutory commands on the strength of nothing more than\nsuppositions about intentions or guesswork about expectations. In\nTitle VII, Congress adopted broad language making it illegal for an\nemployer to rely on an employee\u2019s sex when deciding to fire that\nemployee. We do not hesitate to recognize today a necessary\nconsequence of that legislative choice: An employer who fires an\nindividual merely for being gay or transgender defies the law.The judgments of the Second and Sixth Circuits\nin Nos. 17\u20131623 and 18\u2013107 are affirmed. The judgment of the\nEleventh Circuit in No. 17\u20131618 is reversed, and the case is\nremanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.",
