    "text": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES_________________No. 17\u2013130_________________RAYMOND J. LUCIA, et\u00a0al., PETITIONERSv.SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSIONon writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the district of columbia circuit[June 21, 2018]Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Gorsuch\njoins, concurring.I agree with the Court that this case is\nindistinguishable fromFreytagv.Commissioner, 501\nU.\u00a0S. 868 (1991). If the special trial judges inFreytagwere \u201cOfficers of the United States,\u201d Art.\u00a0II,\n\u00a72, cl.\u00a02, then so are the administrative law judges of the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission. Moving forward, however, this\nCourt will not be able to decide every Appointments Clause case by\ncomparing it toFreytag. And, as the Court acknowledges, our\nprecedents in this area do not provide much guidance. Seeante,at 6. While precedents likeFreytagdiscuss\nwhat issufficientto make someone an officer of the United\nStates, our precedents have never clearly defined what isnecessary. I would resolve that question based on the\noriginal public meaning of \u201cOfficers of the United States.\u201d To the\nFounders, this term encompassed all federal civil officials\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018with responsibility for an ongoing statutory duty.\u2019\u00a0\u201dNLRBv.SW General, Inc., 580 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___\n(2017) (Thomas, J., concurring) (slip op., at 4); Mascott, Who Are\n\u201cOfficers of the United States\u201d? 70 Stan. L.\u00a0Rev. 443, 564\n(2018) (Mascott).[1]The Appointments Clause provides the exclusive\nprocess for appointing \u201cOfficers of the United States.\u201d SeeSW\nGeneral,supra, at ___ (opinion of Thomas, J.) (slip\nop., at 1). While principal officers must be nominated by the\nPresident and confirmed by the Senate, Congress can authorize the\nappointment of \u201cinferior Officers\u201d by \u201cthe President alone,\u201d \u201cthe\nCourts of Law,\u201d or \u201cthe Heads of Departments.\u201d Art.\u00a0II, \u00a72,\ncl.\u00a02.This alternative process for appointing inferior\nofficers strikes a balance between efficiency and accountability.\nGiven the sheer number of inferior officers, it would be too\nburdensome to require each of them to run the gauntlet of Senate\nconfirmation. SeeUnited Statesv.Germaine, 99\nU.\u00a0S. 508, 509\u2013510 (1879); 2 Records of the Federal Convention\nof 1787, pp. 627\u2013628 (M.\u00a0Farrand ed. 1911). But, by specifying\nonly a limited number of actors who can appoint inferior officers\nwithout Senate confirmation, the Appointments Clause maintains\nclear lines of accountability\u2014encouraging good appointments and\ngiving the public someone to blame for bad ones. See The Federalist\nNo. 76, p.\u00a0455 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (A.\u00a0Hamilton);\nWilson, Lectures on Law: Government, in 1 The Works of James Wilson\n343, 359\u2013361 (J. Andrews ed., 1896).The Founders likely understood the term\n\u201cOfficers of the United States\u201d to encompass all federal civil\nofficials who perform an ongoing, statutory duty\u2014no matter how\nimportant or significant the duty. See Mascott 454. \u201cOfficers of\nthe United States\u201d was probably not a term of art that the\nConstitution used to signify some special type of official. Based\non how the Founders used it and similar terms, the phrase \u201cof the\nUnited States\u201d was merely a synonym for \u201cfederal,\u201d and the word\n\u201cOffice[r]\u201d carried its ordinary meaning. Seeid.,at\n471\u2013479. The ordinary meaning of \u201cofficer\u201d was anyone who performed\na continuous public duty. Seeid.,at 484\u2013507;e.g.,\nUnited Statesv.Maurice, 26 F.\u00a0Cas. 1211, 1214\n(No. 15,747) (CC Va. 1823) (defining officer as someone in\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018a public charge or employment\u2019\u00a0\u201d who performed a\n\u201ccontinuing\u201d duty); 8 Annals of Cong. 2304\u20132305 (1799) (statement\nof Rep. Harper) (explaining that the word officer \u201cis derived from\nthe Latin wordofficium\u201d and \u201cincludes all persons holding\nposts which require the performance of some public duty\u201d). For\nfederal officers, that duty is \u201cestablished by Law\u201d\u2014that is, by\nstatute. Art.\u00a0II, \u00a72, cl. 2. The Founders considered\nindividuals to be officers even if they performed only ministerial\nstatutory duties\u2014including recordkeepers, clerks, and tidewaiters\n(individuals who watched goods land at a customhouse). See Mascott\n484\u2013507. Early congressional practice reflected this understanding.\nWith exceptions not relevant here,[2] Congress required all fed- eral officials with ongoing\nstatutory duties to be appointed in compliance with the\nAppointments Clause. Seeid.,at 507\u2013545.Applying the original meaning here, the\nadministrative law judges of the Securities and Exchange Commission\neasily qualify as \u201cOfficers of the United States.\u201d These judges\nexercise many of the agency\u2019s statutory duties, including issuing\ninitial decisions in adversarial proceedings. See 15\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a778d\u20131(a); 17 CFR \u00a7\u00a7200.14, 200.30\u20139 (2017). As\nexplained, the importance or significance of these statutory duties\nis irrelevant. All that matters is that the judges are continuously\nresponsible for performing them.In short, the administrative law judges of the\nSecurities Exchange Commission are \u201cOfficers of the United States\u201d\nunder the original meaning of the Appointments Clause. They have\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018responsibility for an ongoing statutory duty,\u2019\u00a0\u201d which\nis sufficient to resolve this case.SW General, 580\nU.\u00a0S., at ___ (opinion of Thomas, J.) (slip op., at 4).\nBecause the Court reaches the same conclusion by correctly applyingFreytag, I join its opinion.Notes1I address only the\ndividing line between \u201cOfficers of the United States,\u201d who are\nsubject to the Appointments Clause, and nonofficer employees, who\nare not. I express no view on the meaning of \u201cOffice\u201d or \u201cOfficer\u201d\nin any other provision of the Constitution, or the difference\nbetween principal officers and inferior officers under the\nAppointments Clause.2The First Congress\nexempted certain officials with ongoing statu-tory duties, such as\ndeputies and military officers, from the requirementsof the\nAppointments Clause. But these narrow exceptions do not disprove\nthe rule, as background principles of founding-era law explain each\nof them. See Mascott 480\u2013483, 515\u2013530.",
