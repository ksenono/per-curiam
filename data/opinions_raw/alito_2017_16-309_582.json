    "text": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES_________________No. 16\u2013309_________________DIVNA MASLENJAK, PETITIONERv.UNITED STATESon writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the sixth circuit[June 22, 2017]Justice Alito, concurring in the judgment.We granted review in this case to decide whether\n\u201ca naturalized American citizen can be stripped of her citizenship\nin a criminal proceeding based on an immaterial false statement.\u201d\nPet. for Cert. i. The answer to that question is \u201cno.\u201d Although the\nrelevant criminal statute, 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71425(a), does not\nexpressly refer to the concept of materiality, the critical\nstatutory language effectively requires proof of materiality in a\ncase involving false statements. The statute makes it a crime for a\nperson to \u201cprocure\u201d naturalization \u201ccontrary to law.\u201d In false\nstatement cases, then, the statute essentially imposes the familiar\nmateriality requirement that applies in other contexts. That is, a\nperson violates the statute by procuring naturalization through an\nillegal false statement which has a \u201cnatural tendency to influence\u201d\nthe outcome\u2014that is, the obtaining of naturalization.Kungysv.United States, 485 U.\u00a0S. 759, 772 (1988) .Understood in this way, Section 1425(a) does not\nrequire proof that a false statement actually had some effect on\nthe naturalization decision. The operative statutory\nlanguage\u2014\u201cprocure\u201d naturalization \u201ccontrary to law\u201d\u2014imposes no such\nrequirement.Here is an example. Eight co-workers jointly buy\ntwo season tickets to see their favorite football team play. They\nall write their names on a piece of paper and place the slips in a\nhat to see who will get the tickets for the big game with their\nteam\u2019s traditional rival. One of the friends puts his name in\ntwice, and his name is drawn. I would say that he \u201cprocured\u201d the\ntickets \u201ccontrary to\u201d the rules of the drawing even though he might\nhave won if he had put his name in only once.Here is another example. A runner who holds the\nworld\u2019s record in an event wants to make sure she wins the gold\nmedal at the Olympics, so she takes a performance enhancing drug.\nShe wins the race but fails a drug test and is disqualified. The\nsecond-place time is slow, and sportswriters speculate that she\nwould have won without taking the drug. But it would be entirely\nconsistent with standard English usage for the race officials to\nsay that she \u201cprocured\u201d her first-place finish \u201ccontrary to\u201d the\ngoverning rules.As these examples illustrate\u2014and others could be\nadded\u2014the language of 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71425(a) does not\nrequire that an illegal false statement have a demonstrable effect\non the naturalization decision. Instead, the statute applies when a\nperson makes an illegal false statement to obtain naturalization,\nand that false statement is material to the outcome. I see no\nindication that Congress meant to require more.One additional point is worth mentioning.\nSection 1425(a) not only makes it a crime to procure naturalization\ncontrary to law; it applies equally to any person who \u201cattempts to\nprocure, contrary to law .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. naturalization.\u201d\nTherefore, if a defendant knowingly performs a substantial act that\nhe or she thinks will procure naturalization, that is sufficient\nfor conviction.
