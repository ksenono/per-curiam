Given\nthis provision, the responsibilities of an office requiring\nPresidential appointment and Senate confirmation\u2014known as a \u201cPAS\u201d\noffice\u2014may go unperformed if a va-cancy arises and the President\nand Senate cannot promptly agree on a replacement. Congress has\nlong accountedfor this reality by authorizing the President to\ndirect certain officials to temporarily carry out the duties of a\nvacant PAS office in an acting capacity, without Senate\nconfirmation.The Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998 (FVRA),\n5 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73345et\u00a0seq., is the latest\nversion of that authorization. Section 3345(a) of the FVRA\nauthorizes three classes of Government officials to become acting\nofficers. The general rule is that the first assistant to a vacant\noffice shall become the acting officer. The President may override\nthat default rule by directing either a person serving in a\ndifferent PAS office or a senior employee within the relevant\nagency to become the acting officer instead.The FVRA, however, prohibits certain persons\nfrom serving as acting officers if the President has nominated them\nto fill the vacant office permanently. The question presented is\nwhether that limitation applies only to first assistants who have\nautomatically assumed acting duties, or whether it also applies to\nPAS officers and senior employees serving as acting officers at the\nPresident\u2019s behest. We hold that it applies to all three categories\nof acting officers.IAThe Senate\u2019s advice and consent power is a\ncritical \u201cstructural safeguard[\u00a0] of the constitutional\nscheme.\u201dEdmondv.United States, 520 U.\u00a0S. 651,\n659 (1997) . The Framers envisioned it as \u201can excellent check upon\na spirit of favoritism in the President\u201d and a guard against \u201cthe\nappointment of unfit characters .\u00a0.\u00a0. from family\nconnection, from personal attachment, or from a view to\npopularity.\u201d The Federalist No. 76, p. 457 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961)\n(A. Hamilton). The constitutional process of Presidential\nappointment and Senate confirmation, however, can take time: The\nPresident may not promptly settle on a nominee to fill an office;\nthe Senate may be unable, or unwilling, to speedily confirm the\nnominee once submitted. Yet neither may desire to see the duties of\nthe vacant office go unperformed in the interim.Since President Washington\u2019s first term,\nCongress has given the President limited authority to appoint\nacting officials to temporarily perform the functions of a vacant\nPAS office without first obtaining Senate approval. The earliest\nstatutes authorized the appointment of \u201cany person or persons\u201d to\nfill specific vacancies in the Departments of State, Treasury, and\nWar. Act of May 8, 1792, ch. 37, \u00a78, 1Stat. 281. Congress at first\nallowed acting officers to serve until the permanent officeholder\ncould resume his duties or a successor was appointed,ibid.,\nbut soon imposed a six-month limit on acting service, Act of Feb.\n13, 1795, ch. 21, 1Stat. 415.Congress revisited the issue in the 1860s,\nultimately passing the Vacancies Act of 1868. The Vacancies Act\nexpanded the number of PAS offices that the President could fill\nwith acting officers. Act of July 23, 1868, ch. 227, 15Stat. 168;\nsee also Act of Feb. 20, 1863, ch. 45, 12Stat. 656. With that\nexpansion came new constraints. The authority to appoint \u201cany\nperson or persons\u201d as an acting officer gave way to a default rule\nthat the \u201cfirst or sole assistant .\u00a0.\u00a0. shall\u201d perform\nthat function, with an exception allowing the President to instead\nfill the post with a person already serving in a PAS office.\n15Stat. 168. And rather than six months of acting service, the\nVacancies Act generally authorized only ten days.Ibid.That\nnarrow window of acting service was later lengthened to 30 days.\nAct of Feb. 6, 1891, ch. 113, 26Stat. 733.During the 1970s and 1980s, interbranch conflict\narose over the Vacancies Act. The Department of Justice took the\nposition that, in many instances, the head of an executive agency\nhad independent authority apart from the Vacancies Act to\ntemporarily fill vacant offices. The Comptroller General disagreed,\narguing that the Act was the exclusive authority for temporarily\nfilling vacancies in executive agencies. See M. Rosenberg,\nCongressional Research Service Report for Congress, The New\nVacancies Act: Congress Acts to Protect the Senate\u2019s Confirmation\nPrerogative 2\u20134 (1998) (Rosenberg). Congress then amended the\nVacancies Act to clarify that it applies to such agencies, while at\nthe same time lengthening the term of permissible acting service to\n120 days, with a tolling period while a nomination is pending.Id.,at 3; see Presidential Transitions Effectiveness Act,\n\u00a77, 102Stat. 988.But tensions did not ease. By 1998,\napproximately 20 percent of PAS offices in executive agencies were\noccupied by \u201ctemporary designees, most of whom had served beyond\nthe 120-day limitation period .\u00a0.\u00a0. without presidential\nsubmissions of nominations.\u201d Rosenberg 1. These acting officers\nfilled high-level positions, sometimes in obvious contravention of\nthe Senate\u2019s wishes. One, for instance, was brought in from outside\nGovernment to serve as Acting Assistant Attorney General for the\nCivil Rights Division of the Justice Department, immediately after\nthe Senate refused to confirm him for that very office.Ibid.; see M. Rosenberg, Congressional Research Service,\nValid-ity of Designation of Bill Lann Lee as Acting Assistant\nAttorney General for Civil Rights 1\u20133 (1998). Perceiving a threat\nto the Senate\u2019s advice and consent power, see Rosen-berg 6,\nCongress acted again. In 1998, it replaced the Vacancies Act with\nthe FVRA.Section 3345(a) of the FVRA permits three\ncategories of Government officials to perform acting service in a\nvacant PAS office. Subsection (a)(1) prescribes a general rule: If\na person serving in a PAS office dies, resigns, or is otherwise\nunable to perform his duties, the first assistant to that office\n\u201cshall perform\u201d the office\u2019s \u201cfunctions and duties .\u00a0.\u00a0.\ntemporarily in an acting capacity.\u201dThe next two paragraphs of \u00a73345(a) identify\nalternatives. Subsection (a)(2) provides that \u201cnotwithstanding\nparagraph (1),\u201d the President \u201cmay direct a person\u201d who already\nserves in a PAS office to \u201cperform the functions and duties of the\nvacant office temporarily in an acting capacity.\u201d Subsection (a)(3)\nadds that \u201cnotwithstanding paragraph (1),\u201d the President \u201cmay\ndirect\u201d a person to perform acting duties if the person served in a\nsenior position in the relevant agency for at least 90 days in the\n365-day period preceding the vacancy.[1]Section 3345 also makes certain individuals\nineligible for acting service. Subsection (b)(1) states:\n\u201cNotwithstanding subsection (a)(1), a person may not serve as an\nacting officer for an office under this section\u201d if the President\nnominates him for the vacant PAS office and, during the 365-day\nperiod preceding the vacancy, the individual \u201cdid not serve in the\nposition of first assistant\u201d to that office or \u201cserved in [that]\nposition .\u00a0.\u00a0. for less than 90 days.\u201d Subsection (b)(2)\ncreates an exception to this prohibition, providing that\n\u201c[p]aragraph (1) shall not apply to any person\u201d serving in a first\nassistant position that itself requires the Senate\u2019s advice and\nconsent.Other sections of the FVRA establish time limits\non acting service and penalties for noncompliance. In most cases,\nthe statute permits acting service for \u201c210 days beginning on the\ndate the vacancy occurs\u201d; tolls that time limit while a nomination\nis pending; and starts a new 210-day clock if the nomination is\n\u201crejected, withdrawn, or returned.\u201d \u00a7\u00a73346(a)\u2013(b)(1). Upon a second\nnomination, the time limit tolls once more, and an acting officer\ncan serve an additional 210 days if the second nomination proves\nunsuccessful. \u00a73346(b)(2). The FVRA ensures compliance by providing\nthat, in general, \u201cany function or duty of a vacant office\u201d\nperformed by a person not properly serving under the statute \u201cshall\nhave no force or effect.\u201d \u00a73348(d).BThe National Labor Relations Board (NLRB or\nBoard) is charged with administering the National Labor Relations\nAct. By statute, its general counsel must be appointed by the\nPresident with the advice and consent of the Senate. 29\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7153(d).In June 2010, the NLRB\u2019s general counsel\u2014who had\nbeen serving with Senate confirmation\u2014resigned. The President\ndirected Lafe Solomon to serve temporarily as the NLRB\u2019s acting\ngeneral counsel, citing the FVRA as the basis for the appointment.\nSee Memorandum from President Barack Obama to L. Solomon (June 18,\n2010). Solomon satisfied the requirements for acting service under\nsubsection (a)(3) of the FVRA because he had spent the previous ten\nyears in the senior position of Director of the NLRB\u2019s Office of\nRepresentation Appeals.The President had bigger plans for Solomon than\nacting service. On January 5, 2011, he nominated Solomon to serve\nas the NLRB\u2019s general counsel on a permanent basis. The Senate had\nother ideas. That body did not act upon the nomination during the\n112th Congress, so it was returned to the President when the\nlegislative session expired. 159 Cong. Rec. S17 (Jan. 3, 2013). The\nPresident resubmitted Solomon\u2019s name for consideration in the\nspring of 2013,id.,at S3884 (May 23, 2013), but to no\navail. The President ultimately withdrew Solomon\u2019s nomination and\nput forward a new candidate, whom the Senate confirmed on October\n29, 2013.Id.,at S7635. Throughout this entire period,\nSolomon served as the NLRB\u2019s acting general counsel.Solomon\u2019s responsibilities included exercising\n\u201cfinal authority\u201d to issue complaints alleging unfair labor\npractices. 29 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a7153(d), 160(b). In January 2013,\nan NLRB Regional Director, exercising authority on Solomon\u2019s\nbehalf, issued a complaint alleging that respondent SW General,\nInc.\u2014a company that provides ambulance services\u2014had improperly\nfailed to pay certain bonuses to long-term employees. An\nAdministrative Law Judge concluded that SW General had committed\nunfair labor practices, and the NLRB agreed. 360\nN.\u00a0L.\u00a0R.\u00a0B. 109 (2014).SW General filed a petition for review in the\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia\nCircuit. It argued that the unfair labor practices complaint was\ninvalid because, under subsection (b)(1) of the FVRA, Solomon could\nnot legally perform the duties of general counsel after having been\nnominated to fill that position. The NLRB defended Solomon\u2019s\nactions. It contended that subsection (b)(1) applies only to first\nassistants who automatically assume acting duties under subsection\n(a)(1), not to acting officers who, like Solomon, serve under\n(a)(2) or (a)(3).The Court of Appeals granted SW General\u2019s\npetition for review and vacated the Board\u2019s order. It reasoned that\n\u201cthe text of subsection (b)(1) squarely supports\u201d the conclusion\nthat the provision\u2019s restriction on nominees serving as acting\nofficers \u201capplies to all acting officers, no matter whether they\nserve pursuant to subsection (a)(1), (a)(2) or (a)(3).\u201d 796\nF.\u00a03d 67, 78 (CADC 2015). As a result, Solomon became\n\u201cineligible to serve as Acting General Counsel once the President\nnominated him to be General Counsel.\u201dId.,at 72.[2] We granted certiorari, 579\nU.\u00a0S. ___ (2016), and now affirm.IISubsection (b)(1) of the FVRA prevents a\nperson who has been nominated for a vacant PAS office from\nperforming the duties of that office in an acting capacity. In\nfull, it states:\u201c(1) Notwithstanding subsection (a)(1), a\nperson may not serve as an acting officer for an office under this\nsection, if\u2014(A) during the 365-day period preceding the\ndate of the death, resignation, or beginning of inability to serve,\nsuch person\u2014(i) did not serve in the position of first\nassistant to the office of such officer; or(ii) served in the position of first assistant\nto the office of such officer for less than 90 days; and(B) the President submits a nomination of such\nperson to the Senate for appointment to such office.\u201dSubsection (b)(2) adds that \u201c[p]aragraph (1)\nshall not apply\u201d to a person serving in a first assistant position\nthat itself requires the advice and consent of the Senate.We conclude that the prohibition in subsection\n(b)(1) applies to anyone performing acting service under the FVRA.\nIt is not, as the Board contends, limited to first assistants\nperforming acting service under subsection (a)(1). The text of the\nprohibition extends to any \u201cperson\u201d who serves \u201cas an acting\nofficer .\u00a0.\u00a0. under this section,\u201d not just to \u201cfirst\nassistants\u201d serving under subsection (a)(1). The phrase\n\u201c[n]otwithstanding subsection (a)(1)\u201d does not limit the reach of\n(b)(1), but instead clarifies that the prohibition applies even\nwhen it conflicts with the default rule that first assistants shall\nperform acting duties.A1Our analysis of subsection (b)(1) begins with\nits text. Subsection (b)(1) applies to any \u201cperson\u201d and prohibits\nservice \u201cas an acting officer for an office under this section.\u201d\nThe key words are \u201cperson\u201d and \u201csection.\u201d They clearly indicate\nthat (b)(1) applies to all acting officers under \u00a73345, regardless\nof the means of appointment.Start with \u201cperson.\u201d The word has a naturally\nexpansive meaning that can encompass anyone who performs acting\nduties under the FVRA. SeePfizer Inc.v.Government of\nIndia, 434 U.\u00a0S. 308, 312 (1978) . Important as they may\nbe, first assistants are not the only \u201cperson[s]\u201d of the bunch.Now add \u201cunder this section.\u201d The language\nclarifies that subsection (b)(1) applies to all persons serving\nunder \u00a73345. Congress often drafts statutes with hierarchical\nschemes\u2014section, subsection, paragraph, and on down the line. SeeKoons Buick Pontiac GMC, Inc.v.Nigh, 543 U.\u00a0S.\n50 \u201361 (2004); L. Filson, The Legislative Drafter\u2019s Desk Reference\n222 (1992). Congress used that structure in the FVRA and relied on\nit to make precise cross-references. When Congress wanted to refer\nonly to a particular subsection or paragraph, it said so. See,e.g.,\u00a73346(a)(2) (\u201csubsection (b)\u201d); \u00a73346(b)(2)\n(\u201cparagraph (1)\u201d). But in (b)(1) Congress referred to the entire\nsection\u2014\u00a73345\u2014which subsumes all of the ways a person may become an\nacting officer.The rest of the FVRA uses the pairing of\n\u201cperson\u201d and \u201csection\u201d the same way. Section 3346, for example,\nspecifies how long \u201cthepersonserving as an acting officer\nas described undersection3345 may serve in the office.\u201d\n(Emphasis added.) And \u00a73348(d)(1) describes the consequences of\nnoncompliance with the FVRA by referring to the actions \u201ctaken by\nanypersonwho is not acting undersection3345,\n3346, or 3347.\u201d (Emphasis added.) No one disputes that both\nprovisions apply to anyone serving as an acting officer under the\nFVRA, not just first assistants serving under subsection\n(a)(1).Had Congress intended subsection (b)(1) to apply\nonly to first assistants acting under (a)(1), it could easily have\nchosen clearer language. Replacing \u201cperson\u201d with \u201cfirst assistant\u201d\nwould have done the trick. So too would replacing \u201cunder this\nsection\u201d with \u201cunder subsection (a)(1).\u201d \u201cThe fact that [Congress]\ndid not adopt [either] readily available and apparent alternative\nstrongly supports\u201d the conclusion that subsection (b)(1) applies to\nany acting officer appointed under any provision within \u00a73345.Knightv.Commissioner, 552 U.\u00a0S. 181, 188\n(2008) .The dependent clause at the beginning of\nsubsection (b)(1)\u2014\u201c[n]otwithstanding subsection (a)(1)\u201d\u2014confirms\nthat the prohibition on acting service applies even when it\nconflicts with the default rule that the first assistant shall\nperform acting duties. The ordinary meaning of \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d is\n\u201cin spite of,\u201d or \u201cwithout prevention or obstruction from or by.\u201d\nWebster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 1545 (1986); Black\u2019s\nLaw Dictionary 1091 (7th ed. 1999) (\u201cDespite; in spite of\u201d). In\nstatutes, the word \u201cshows which provision prevails in the event of\na clash.\u201d A. Scalia & B. Garner, Reading Law: The\nInterpretation of Legal Texts 126\u2013127 (2012). Subsection (a)(1)\nsets the rule that first assistants \u201cshall perform\u201d the vacant\noffice\u2019s \u201cfunctions and duties .\u00a0.\u00a0. in an acting\ncapacity.\u201d But the \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d clause in subsection (b)(1)\nmeans that, even if a first assistant is serving as an acting\nofficer under this statutory mandate, he must cease that service if\nthe President nominates him to fill the vacant PAS office. That\nsubsection (b)(1) also applies to acting officers serving at the\nPresident\u2019s behest is already clear from the broad text of the\nindependent clause\u2014they are all \u201cperson[s]\u201d serving \u201cunder this\nsection.\u201d2The Board takes a different view of the phrase\n\u201c[n]otwithstanding subsection (a)(1).\u201d It begins by noting that\n\u00a73345(a) uses three different subsections to \u201ccreate three separate\npaths for becoming an acting official.\u201d Reply Brief 2. The\nprohibition in subsection (b)(1), the Board continues, \u201capplies\n\u2018[n]otwithstanding\u2019 onlyoneof these\nsubsections\u2014\u2018subsection (a)(1).\u2019\u00a0\u201dIbid.In the Board\u2019s\nview, singling out subsection (a)(1) carries a negative\nimplication: that \u201cCongress did not intend Subsection (b)(1) to\noverride the alternative mechanisms for acting service in\nSubsections (a)(2) and (a)(3).\u201dId.,at 3.We disagree. The Board relies on the\n\u201cinterpretive canon,expressio unius est exclusio alterius,\n\u2018expressing one item of [an] associated group or series excludes\nanother left unmentioned.\u2019\u00a0\u201dChevron U.\u00a0S.\u00a0A.\nInc.v.Echazabal, 536 U.\u00a0S. 73, 80 (2002) (quotingUnited Statesv.Vonn, 535 U.\u00a0S. 55, 65 (2002)\n). If a sign at the entrance to a zoo says \u201ccome see the elephant,\nlion, hippo, and giraffe,\u201d and a temporary sign is added saying\n\u201cthe giraffe is sick,\u201d you would reasonably assume that the others\nare in good health.\u201cThe force of any negative implication, however,\ndepends on context.\u201dMarxv.General Revenue Corp.,\n568 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 9). Theexpressio\nuniuscanon applies only when \u201ccircumstances support[\u00a0] a\nsensible inference that the term left out must have been meant to\nbe excluded.\u201dEchazabal, 536 U.\u00a0S., at 81. A\n\u201cnotwithstanding\u201d clause does not naturally give rise to such an\ninference; it just shows which of two or more provisions prevails\nin the event of a conflict. Such a clause confirms rather than\nconstrains breadth. Singling out one potential conflict might\nsuggest that Congress thought the conflict was particularly\ndifficult to resolve, or was quite likely to arise. But doing so\ngenerally does not imply anything about other, unaddressed\nconflicts, much less that they should be resolved in theoppositemanner.Suppose a radio station announces: \u201cWe play your\nfavorite hits from the \u201960s, \u201970s, and \u201980s. Notwithstanding the\nfact that we play hits from the \u201960s, we do not play music by\nBritish bands.\u201d You would not tune in expecting to hear the 1970s\nBritish band \u201cThe Clash\u201d any more than the 1960s \u201cBeatles.\u201d The\nstation, after all, has announced that \u201cwe do not play music by\nBritish bands.\u201d The \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d clause just establishes that\nthis applies even to music from the \u201960s, when British bands were\nprominently featured on the charts. No one, however, would think\nthe station singled out the \u201960s to convey implicitly that its\ncategorical statement \u201cwe do not play music by British bands\u201d\nactually did not apply to the \u201970s and \u201980s.Drawing a negative inference from the\n\u201cnotwithstanding\u201d clause in subsection (b)(1) is similarly inapt.\nWithout that clause, subsection (b)(1) plainly would apply to all\npersons serving as acting officers under \u00a73345(a). Adding\n\u201cnotwithstanding subsection (a)(1)\u201d makes sense because (a)(1)\nconflicts with (b)(1) in a unique manner. The former is mandatory\nand self-executing: The first assistant \u201cshallperform\u201d\nacting duties. The latter, by contrast, speaks to who \u201cmay not\u201d be\nan acting officer. So if a vacancy arises and the President\nnominates the first assistant to fill the position, (a)(1) says the\nfirst assistant \u201cshall perform\u201d the duties of that office in an\nacting capacity while the nomination is pending, and (b)(1) says he\n\u201cmay not.\u201d The \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d clause clarifies that the language\nof (a)(1) does not prevail if that conflict occurs.Compare the mandatory language of subsection\n(a)(1) to (a)(2) and (a)(3). People appointed under those\nprovisions are just as much acting officers as first assistants who\nassume the role. But there is no freestanding directive that they\nperform acting duties; subsections (a)(2) and (a)(3) just say that\nthe President \u201cmay direct\u201d them to do so. The natural inference,\nthen, is that Congress left these provisions out of the\n\u201cnotwithstanding\u201d clause because they are different from subsection\n(a)(1), not to exempt from the broad prohibition in subsection\n(b)(1) those officers serving under (a)(2) and (a)(3).Indeed, \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d is used the same way\nin other parts of \u00a73345. Subsections (a)(2) and (a)(3) are each\npreceded by the phrase \u201cnotwithstanding paragraph (1).\u201d The phrase\nrecognizes that subsection (a)(1) is unique, and resolves the\npotential conflict between the mandatory \u201cshall perform\u201d in that\nprovision and the permissive \u201cmay direct\u201d in (a)(2) and (a)(3). But\nit implies nothing about other potential conflicts that may arise\nin the statutory scheme. In subsection (b)(1), it works the same\nway: The \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d clause simply shows that (b)(1)\noverrides (a)(1), and nothing more.Step back from the Board\u2019s focus on\n\u201cnotwithstanding\u201d and another problem appears: Its interpretation\nof subsection (b)(1) makes a mess of (b)(2). Subsection (b)(2)\nspecifies that (b)(1) \u201cshall not apply to any person\u201d if (A) that\nperson \u201cis serving as the first assistant\u201d; (B) the first assistant\nposition is itself a PAS office; and (C) \u201cthe Senate has approved\nthe appointment of such person\u201d to that office.The Board\u2019s interpretation makes the first\nrequirement superfluous, a result we typically try to avoid.Williamsv.Taylor, 529 U.\u00a0S. 362, 404 (2000)\n(\u201cIt is .\u00a0.\u00a0. a cardinal principle of statutory\nconstruction that we must give effect, if possible, to every clause\nand word of a statute.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). If\nsubsection (b)(1) applied only to first assistants, there would be\nno need to state the requirement in (b)(2)(A) that \u201csuch person is\nserving as the first assistant.\u201d The Board proposes that Congress\ndid so for clarity, but the same could be said of most superfluous\nlanguage.The Board and the dissent counter that applying\nthe prohibition in subsection (b)(1) to anyone performing acting\nservice under \u00a73345(a) has its own problem: Doing so would also\nrequire applying it to \u00a73345(c)(1), which \u201cwould nullify\u201d that\nprovision. Reply Brief 9. The dissent deems this \u201cno way to read a\nstatute.\u201dPost, at 6.We agree, and it is not the way we read it.\nUnder our reading, subsection (b)(1) has no effect on (c)(1).\nSubsection (b)(1) addresses nominationsgenerally,\nprohibiting any person who has been nominated to fill any vacant\noffice from performing that office\u2019s duties in an acting capacity.\nSubsection (c)(1) speaks to aspecificnomination scenario:\nWhen a person is \u201cnominated by the President for reappointment for\nan additional term to the same office .\u00a0.\u00a0. without a\nbreak in service.\u201d In this particular situation, the FVRA\nauthorizes the nominee \u201cto continue to serve in that office.\u201d\n\u00a73345(c). \u201c[I]t is a commonplace of statutory construction that the\nspecific governs the general.\u201dRadLAX Gateway Hotel, LLCv.Amalgamated Bank, 566 U.\u00a0S. 639, 645 (2012) . The\ngeneral prohibition on acting service by nominees yields to the\nmore specific authorization allowing officers up for reappointment\nto remain at their posts. Applying subsection (b)(1) to \u00a73345(a)\nhardly compels a different result.The text of subsection (b)(1) is clear: Subject\nto one narrow exception, it prohibits anyone who has been nominated\nto fill a vacant PAS office from performing the duties of that\noffice in an acting capacity, regardless of whether the acting\nofficer was appointed under subsection (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3).\nIt is not limited to first assistants who automatically assume\nacting duties under (a)(1).BThe Board contends that legislative history,\npurpose, and post-enactment practice uniformly show that subsection\n(b)(1) applies only to first assistants. The text is clear, so we\nneed not consider this extra-textual evidence. SeeState Farm\nFire & Casualty Co.v.United States ex\u00a0rel.\nRigsby, 580 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2016) (slip op., at 9). In any\nevent, the Board\u2019s evidence is not compelling.The Board argues that subsection (b)(1) was\ndesigned to serve a specific purpose: preventing the President from\nhaving his nominee serve as an acting officer by making him first\nassistant after (or right before) a vacancy arises. Brief for\nPetitioner 38. The original draft of the FVRA authorized first\nassistants and PAS officers to perform acting service. Subsection\n(b) of that draft provided that if a first assistant was nominated\nto fill the vacant office, he could not perform that office\u2019s\nduties in an acting capacity unless he had been the first assistant\nfor at least 180 days before the vacancy. Several Senators thought\nthe FVRA too restrictive. They asked to add senior agency officials\nto the list of potential acting officers and to shorten the 180-day\nlength-of-service requirement in subsection (b). Their requests,\nthe Board says, were granted; the final version of the FVRA\nincluded subsection (a)(3) for senior employees and shortened the\nlength-of-service requirement to 90 days. There was no intent to\nextend the pro-hibition in subsection (b) beyond first assistants.Id.,at 45\u201346.The glitch in this argument is of course the\ntext of subsection (b)(1). Congress did amend the statute to allow\nsenior employees to become acting officers under subsection (a)(3).\nThe only substantive change that was requested in (b) was to reduce\nthe length-of-service requirement. Congress could have done that\nwith a few tweaks to the original version of subsection (b).\nInstead, Congress went further: It also removed language that\nexpressly limited subsection (b) to first assistants. And it added\na provision\u2014subsection (b)(2)\u2014that makes sense only if (b)(1)\napplies to all acting officers. In short, Congress took a provision\nthat explicitly applied only to first assistants and turned it into\none that applies to all acting officers.The Board protests that Congress would not have\nexpanded the prohibition on nominees serving as acting officers\nafter Senators asked to give the Presidentmoreflexibility.\nSee Brief for Petitioner 45\u201346. That certain Senators made specific\ndemands, however, does not mean that they got exactly what they\nwanted. Passing a law often requires compromise, where even the\nmost firm public demands bend to competing interests. SeeRagsdalev.Wolverine World Wide, Inc., 535\nU.\u00a0S. 81 \u201394 (2002). What Congress ultimately agrees on is the\ntext that it enacts, not the preferences expressed by certain\nlegislators. SeeOncalev.Sundowner Offshore Services,\nInc., 523 U.\u00a0S. 75, 79 (1998) (\u201c[I]t is ultimately the\nprovisions of our laws rather than the principal concerns of our\nlegislators by which we are governed.\u201d).Compromise is precisely what happened here: \u201c[A]\nperiod of intense negotiations\u201d took place after Senators demanded\nchanges to the original draft of the FVRA, and the final bill was\n\u201ca compromise measure.\u201d Rosenberg 9. The legislation as passeddidexpand the pool of individuals the President could\nappoint as acting officers, by adding senior employees in\nsubsection (a)(3). But it also expanded the scope of the limitation\non acting service in (b)(1), by dropping the language making (b)(1)\napplicable only to first assistants.The Board contends that this compromise must not\nhave happened because Senator Thompson, one of the sponsors of the\nFVRA, said that subsection (b)(1) \u201capplies only when the acting\nofficer is the first assistant, and not when the acting officer is\ndesignated by the President pursuant to \u00a7\u00a73345(a)(2) or\n3345(a)(3).\u201d 144 Cong. Rec. 27496 (1998). But Senator Byrd\u2014the very\nnext speaker\u2014offered a contradictory account: A nominee may not\n\u201cserve as an acting officer\u201d if \u201che is not the first assistant\u201d or\n\u201chas been the first assistant for less than 90 .\u00a0.\u00a0.\ndays, and has not been confirmed for the position.\u201dId.,at\n27498. This is a good example of why floor statements by individual\nlegislators rank among the least illuminating forms of legislative\nhistory. SeeMilnerv.Department of Navy, 562\nU.\u00a0S. 562, 572 (2011) (\u201cThose of us who make use of\nlegislative history believe that clear evidence of congressional\nintent may illuminate ambiguous text. We will not take the opposite\ntack of allowing ambiguous legislative history to muddy clear\nstatutory language.\u201d).Finally, the Board supports its interpretation\nwith post-enactment practice. It notes that the Office of Legal\nCounsel and the Government Accountability Office have issued\nguidance construing subsection (b)(1) to apply only to first\nassistants. And three Presidents have, without congressional\nobjection, submitted the nominations of 112 individuals who were\nserving as acting officers under subsections (a)(2) and (a)(3). The\nBoard contends that this \u201chistorical practice\u201d is entitled to\n\u201csignificant weight\u201d because the FVRA \u201cconcern[s] the allocation of\npower between two elected branches of Government.\u201d Brief for\nPetitioner 49 (quotingNLRBv.Noel Canning, 573\nU.\u00a0S. ___, ___\u2013___ (2014) (slip op., at 6\u20137); internal\nquotation marks omitted).\u201c[H]istorical practice\u201d is too grand a title for\nthe Board\u2019s evidence. The FVRA was not enacted until 1998, and the\n112 nominations that the Board cites make up less than two percent\nof the thousands of nominations to positions in executive agencies\nthat the Senate has considered in the years since its passage. Even\nthe guidance documents the Board cites paid the matter little\nattention; both made conclusory statements about subsection (b)(1),\nwith no analysis.In this context, Congress\u2019s failure to speak up\ndoes not fairly imply that it has acquiesced in the Board\u2019s\ninterpretation. SeeZuberv.Allen, 396 U.\u00a0S.\n168 , n.\u00a021 (1969);Alexanderv.Sandoval, 532\nU.\u00a0S. 275, 292 (2001) . The Senate may not have noticed that\ncertain nominees were serving as acting officers in violation of\nthe FVRA, or it may have chosen not to reject a qualified candidate\njust to make a point about compliance with the statute. Either is\nat least as plausible as the theory that the Legislature\u2019s inaction\nreflects considered acceptance of the Executive\u2019s practice.Our decision inNoel Canning\u2014the chief\nopinion on which the Board relies\u2014is a sharp contrast. That case\ndealt with the President\u2019s constitutional authority under the\nRecess Appointments Clause, an issue that has attracted intense\nattention and written analysis from Presidents, Attorneys General,\nand the Senate. 573 U.\u00a0S., at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 22\u201332).\nThe voluminous historical record dated back to \u201cthe beginning of\nthe Republic,\u201d and included \u201cthousands of intra-session recess\nappointments.\u201dId.,at ___, ___ (slip op., at 8, 12). That\nthe chronicle of the Recess Appointments Clause weighed heavily inNoel Canningoffers no support to the Board here.IIIApplying the FVRA to this case is\nstraightforward. Solomon was appointed as acting general counsel\nunder subsection (a)(3). Once the President submitted his\nnomination to fill that position in a permanent capacity,\nsubsection (b)(1) prohibited him from continuing his acting\nservice. This does not mean that the duties of general counsel to\nthe NLRB needed to go unperformed; the President could have\nappointed another person to serve as the acting officer in\nSolomon\u2019s place. And he had a wide array of individuals to choose\nfrom: any one of the approximately 250 senior NLRB employees or the\nhundreds of individuals in PAS positions throughout the Government.\nThe President, however, did not do so, and Solomon\u2019s continued\nservice violated the FVRA. Accordingly, the judgment of the Court\nof Appeals is affirmed.It is so ordered.APPENDIXSection 3345 of the FVRA provides:\u201c(a) If an officer of an Executive agency\n(including the Executive Office of the President, and other than\nthe Government Accountability Office) whose appointment to office\nis required to be made by the President, by and with the advice and\nconsent of the Senate, dies, resigns, or is otherwise unable to\nperform the functions and duties of the office\u2014(1) the first assistant to the office of such\nofficer shall perform the functions and duties of the office\ntemporarily in an acting capacity subject to the time limitations\nof section 3346;(2) notwithstanding paragraph (1), the President\n(and only the President) may direct a person who serves in an\noffice for which appointment is required to be made by the\nPresident, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, to\nperform the functions and duties of the vacant office temporarily\nin an acting capacity subject to the time limitations of section\n3346; or(3) notwithstanding paragraph (1), the President\n(and only the President) may direct an officer or employee of such\nExecutive agency to perform the functions and duties of the vacant\noffice temporarily in an acting capacity, subject to the time\nlimitations of section 3346, if\u2014(A) during the 365-day period preceding the date\nof death, resignation, or beginning of inability to serve of the\napplicable officer, the officer or employee served in a position in\nsuch agency for not less than 90 days; and(B) the rate of pay for the position described\nunder subparagraph (A) is equal to or greater than the minimum rate\nof pay payable for a position at GS\u201315 of the General Schedule.(b)(1) Notwithstanding subsection (a)(1), a\nperson may not serve as an acting officer for an office under this\nsection, if\u2014(A) during the 365-day period preceding the date\nof the death, resignation, or beginning of inability to serve, such\nperson\u2014(i) did not serve in the position of first\nassistant to the office of such officer; or(ii) served in the position of first assistant\nto the office of such officer for less than 90 days; and(B) the President submits a nomination of such\nperson to the Senate for appointment to such office.(2) Paragraph (1) shall not apply to any person\nif\u2014(A) such person is serving as the first\nassistant to the office of an officer described under subsection\n(a);(B) the office of such first assistant is an\noffice for which appointment is required to be made by the\nPresident, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate;\nand(C) the Senate has approved the appointment of\nsuch person to such office.(c)(1) Notwithstanding subsection (a)(1), the\nPresident (and only the President) may direct an officer who is\nnominated by the President for reappointment for an office in an\nExecutive department without a break in service, to continue to\nserve in that office subject to the time limitations in section\n3346, until such time as the Senate has acted to confirm or reject\nthe nomination, notwithstanding adjournment sine\u00a0die.(2) For purposes of this section and sections\n3346, 3347, 3348, 3349, 3349a, and 3349d, the expiration of a term\nof office is an inability to perform the functions and duties of\nsuch office.\u201dNotes1A senior position is one\nthat has a rate of pay equal to or greater than the minimum rate\n\u201cfor a position at GS\u201315 of the General Schedule.\u201d 5\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73345(a)(3)(B).2The FVRA exempts \u201cthe\nGeneral Counsel of the National Labor Relations Board\u201d from the\ngeneral rule that actions taken in violation of the FVRA are voidab initio. 5 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73348(e)(1).
