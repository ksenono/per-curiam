But\nhe may not usually make a \u201csecond or successive habeas corpus\napplication.\u201d 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72244(b). The question here is\nwhether a motion brought under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n59(e) to alter or amend a habeas court\u2019s judgment qualifies as such\na successive petition. We hold it does not. A Rule 59(e) motion is\ninstead part and parcel of the first habeas proceeding.IThis case is about two procedural rules.\nFirst, Rule 59(e) applies in federal civil litigation generally.\n(Habeas proceedings, for those new to the area, are civil in\nnature. SeeFisherv.Baker,203\nU.S. 174, 181 (1906).) The Rule enables a party to request that\na district court reconsider a just-issued judgment. Second, the\nso-called gatekeeping provision of the Antiterrorism and Effective\nDeath Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), codified at 28\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72244(b), governs federal habeas proceedings. It\nsets stringent limits on second or successive habeas applications.\nWe say a few words about each before describing how the courts\nbelow applied them here.ARule 59(e) allows a litigant to file a \u201cmotion\nto alter or amend a judgment.\u201d[1] The time for doing so is short\u201428 days from entry of\nthe judgment, with no possibility of an extension. See Fed. Rule\nCiv. Proc. 6(b)(2) (prohibiting extensions to Rule 59(e)\u2019s\ndeadline). The Rule gives a district court the chance \u201cto rectify\nits own mistakes in the period immediately following\u201d its decision.Whitev.New Hampshire Dept. of Employment Security,455 U.S.\n445, 450 (1982). In keeping with that corrective function,\n\u201cfederal courts generally have [used] Rule 59(e) only\u201d to\n\u201creconsider[\u00a0] matters properly encompassed in a decision on\nthe merits.\u201dId.,at 451. In particular, courts will not\naddress new arguments or evidence that the moving party could have\nraised before the decision issued. See 11 C. Wright, A. Miller,\n& M. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a72810.1, pp. 163\u2013164\n(3d ed. 2012) (Wright & Miller); accord,Exxon Shipping\nCo.v.Baker,554 U.S.\n471, 485\u2013486, n.\u00a05 (2008) (quoting prior\nedition).[2] The motion is\ntherefore tightly tied to the underlying judgment.The filing of a Rule 59(e) motion within the\n28-day period \u201csuspends the finality of the original judgment\u201d for\npurposes of an appeal.FCCv.League of Women Voters of\nCal.,468 U.S.\n364, 373, n.\u00a010 (1984) (internal quotation marks and\nalterations omitted). Without such a motion, a litigant must take\nan appeal no later than 30 days from the district court\u2019s entry of\njudgment. See Fed. Rule App. Proc. (FRAP) 4(a)(1)(A). But if he\ntimely submits a Rule 59(e) motion, there is no longer a final\njudgment to appeal from. SeeOsterneckv.Ernst &\nWhinney,489 U.S.\n169, 174 (1989). Only the disposition of that motion \u201crestores\nth[e] finality\u201d of the original judgment, thus starting the 30-day\nappeal clock.League of Women Voters, 468 U.\u00a0S., at\n373, n.\u00a010 (internal quotation marks omitted); see FRAP\n4(a)(4)(A)(iv) (A party\u2019s \u201ctime to file an appeal runs\u201d from \u201cthe\nentry of the order disposing of the [Rule 59(e)] motion\u201d). And if\nan appeal follows, the ruling on the Rule 59(e) motion merges with\nthe prior determination, so that the reviewing court takes up only\none judgment. See 11 Wright & Miller \u00a72818, at 246;Fomanv.Davis,371 U.S.\n178, 181 (1962). The court thus addresses any attack on the\nRule 59(e) ruling as part of its review of the underlying\ndecision.Now turn to \u00a72244(b)\u2019s restrictions on second or\nsuccessive habeas petitions. Under AEDPA, a state prisoner always\ngets one chance to bring a federal habeas challenge to his\nconviction. SeeMagwoodv.Patterson,561 U.S.\n320, 333\u2013334 (2010). But after that, the road gets rockier. To\nfile a second or successive application in a district court, a\nprisoner must first obtain leave from the court of appeals based on\na \u201cprima facie showing\u201d that his petition satisfies the statute\u2019s\ngatekeeping requirements. 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72244(b)(3)(C).\nUnder those provisions, which bind the district court even when\nleave is given, a prisoner may not reassert any claims \u201cpresented\nin a prior application.\u201d \u00a72244(b)(1). And he may bring a new claim\nonly if it falls within one of two narrow categories\u2014roughly\nspeaking, if it relies on a new and retroactive rule of\nconstitutional law or if it alleges previously undiscoverable facts\nthat would establish his innocence. See \u00a72244(b)(2). Still more:\nThose restrictions, like all statutes and rules pertaining to\nhabeas, trump any \u201cinconsistent\u201d Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\notherwise applicable to habeas proceedings. 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a72254 Rule 12.BThis case began when, nearly two decades ago,\npetitioner Gregory Banister struck and killed a bicyclist while\ndriving a car. Texas charged him with the crime of aggravated\nassault with a deadly weapon. A jury found him guilty, and he was\nsentenced to 30 years in prison. State courts upheld the conviction\non direct appeal and in collateral proceedings. Banister then\nturned to federal district court for habeas relief. Although\nraising many claims, his petition mainly argued that his trial and\nappellate counsel provided him with constitutionally ineffective\nassistance. The District Court disagreed and entered judgment\ndenying the application.At that point, Banister timely filed a Rule\n59(e) motion asking the District Court to alter its judgment.\nConsistent with the Rule\u2019s corrective purpose, Banister urged the\ncourt to fix what he saw as \u201cmanifest errors of law and fact.\u201d App.\n219. Five days later and without requiring a response from the\nState, the court issued a one-paragraph order explaining that it\nhad reviewed all relevant materials and stood by its decision. Seeid., at 254. In accordance with the timeline for appealing a\njudgment after the denial of a Rule 59(e) motion, seesupra,at 3, Banister then filed a notice of appeal (along with a request\nfor a certificate of appealability) to challenge the District\nCourt\u2019s rejection of his habeas application.Yet the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit\ndismissed the appeal as untimely. That ruling rested on the view\nthat Banister\u2019s Rule 59(e) motion, although captioned as such, was\nnot really a Rule 59(e) motion at all. Because it \u201cattack[ed] the\nfederal court\u2019s previous resolution of [his] claim on the merits,\u201d\nthe Fifth Circuit held that the motion must be \u201cconstrued as a\nsuccessive habeas petition.\u201d App. 305 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). In any future case, that holding would prohibit a habeas\ncourt from considering claims made in a self-styled Rule 59(e)\nmotion except in rare circumstances\u2014that is, when a court of\nappeals gave permission and the claim fell within one of \u00a72244(b)\u2019s\ntwo slender categories. Seesupra,at 3. In Banister\u2019s own\ncase, that bar was of no moment because the District Court had\nalready addressed his motion\u2019s merits. But viewing a Rule 59(e)\nmotion as a successive habeas petition also had another\nconsequence, and this one would affect him. Unlike a Rule 59(e)\nmotion, the Court of Appeals noted, a successive habeas application\ndoes not postpone the time to file an appeal. That meant the clock\nstarted ticking when the District Court denied Banister\u2019s habeas\napplication (rather than his subsequent motion)\u2014and so Banister\u2019s\nappeal was several weeks late.We granted certiorari to resolve a Circuit split\nabout whether a Rule 59(e) motion to alter or amend a habeas\ncourt\u2019s judgment counts as a second or successive habeas\napplication. 588 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2019). We hold it does not, and\nreverse.IIThis case requires us to choose between two\nrules\u2014more specifically, to decide whether AEDPA\u2019s \u00a72244(b)\ndisplaces Rule 59(e) in federal habeas litigation. The Federal\nRules of Civil Procedure generally govern habeas proceedings. See\nFed. Rule Civ. Proc. 81(a)(4). They give way, however, if and to\nthe extent \u201cinconsistent with any statutory provisions or\n[habeas-specific] rules.\u201d 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72254 Rule 12; seesupra,at 3\u20134. Here, the Fifth Circuit concluded and Texas\nnow contends that AEDPA\u2019s limitation of repetitive habeas\napplications conflicts with Rule 59(e)\u2019s ordinary operation. That\nargument in turn hinges on viewing a Rule 59(e) motion in a habeas\ncase as a \u201csecond or successive application.\u201d \u00a72244(b); see Brief\nfor Respondent 10. If such a motion constitutes a second or\nsuccessive petition, then all of \u00a72244(b)\u2019s restrictions kick\nin\u2014limiting the filings Rule 59(e) would allow. But if a Rule 59(e)\nmotion is not so understood\u2014if it is instead part of resolving a\nprisoner\u2019s first habeas application\u2014then \u00a72244(b)\u2019s requirements\nnever come into the picture.The phrase \u201csecond or successive application,\u201d\non which all this rides, is a \u201cterm of art,\u201d which \u201cis not\nself-defining.\u201dSlackv.McDaniel,529 U.S.\n473, 486 (2000);Panettiv.Quarterman,551 U.S.\n930, 943 (2007). We have often made clear that it does not\n\u201csimply \u2018refer\u2019\u00a0\u201d to all habeas filings made \u201c\u00a0\u2018second or\nsuccessively in time,\u2019\u00a0\u201d following an initial application.Magwood, 561 U.\u00a0S., at 332 (quotingPanetti, 551\nU.\u00a0S., at 944 (alteration omitted)). For example, the courts\nof appeals agree (as do both parties) that an amended petition,\nfiled after the initial one but before judgment, is not second or\nsuccessive. See 2 R. Hertz & J. Liebman, Federal Habeas Corpus\nPractice and Procedure \u00a728.1, pp. 1656\u20131657, n.\u00a04 (7th ed.\n2017) (collecting cases); Brief for Petitioner 20\u201321; Brief for\nRespondent 16. So too, appeals from the habeas court\u2019s judgment (or\nstill later petitions to this Court) are not second or successive;\nrather, they are further iterations of the first habeas\napplication.[3] Chronology here\nis by no means all.In addressing what qualifies as second or\nsuccessive, this Court has looked for guidance in two main places.\nFirst, we have explored historical habeas doctrine and practice.\nThe phrase \u201csecond or successive application,\u201d we have explained,\nis \u201cgiven substance in our prior habeas corpus cases,\u201d including\nthose \u201cpredating [AEDPA\u2019s] enactment.\u201dSlack, 529\nU.\u00a0S., at 486;Panetti, 551 U.\u00a0S., at 944; seeid.,at 943 (stating that the phrase \u201ctakes its full meaning\nfrom our case law\u201d). In particular, we have asked whether a type of\nlater-in-time filing would have \u201cconstituted an abuse of the writ,\nas that concept is explained in our [pre-AEDPA] cases.\u201dId.,\nat 947. If so, it is successive; if not, likely not. Second, we\nhave considered AEDPA\u2019s own purposes. The point of \u00a72244(b)\u2019s\nrestrictions, we have stated, is to \u201cconserve judicial resources,\nreduc[e] piecemeal litigation,\u201d and \u201clend[\u00a0] finality to state\ncourt judgments within a reasonable time.\u201dId.,at 945\u2013946\n(internal quotation marks omitted). With those goals in mind, we\nhave considered \u201cthe implications for habeas practice\u201d of allowing\na type of filing, to assess whether Congress would have viewed it\nas successive.Stewartv.Martinez-Villareal,523\nU.S. 637, 644 (1998). Here, both historical precedents and\nstatutory aims point in the same direction\u2014toward permitting Rule\n59(e) motions in habeas proceedings. And nothing cuts the opposite\nway.AThis Court has already held that history\nsupports a habeas court\u2019s consideration of a Rule 59(e) motion. InBrowderv.Director, Dept. of Corrections of Ill.,434 U.S.\n257(1978), we addressed prior to AEDPA \u201cthe applicability of\nFederal Rule [59(e)] in habeas corpus proceedings.\u201dId.,at\n258. In deciding that the Rule applied in habeas\u2014that \u201ca prompt\nmotion for reconsideration\u201d was \u201cthoroughly consistent\u201d with habeas\nlaw and \u201cwell suited to the special problems and character of\n[habeas] proceedings\u201d\u2014we mainly looked to historical practice.Id.,at 271 (internal quotation marks omitted). Rule 59(e),\nwe recounted, derived from a court\u2019s common-law power \u201cto alter or\namend its own judgments during[] the term of court in which [they\nwere] rendered,\u201d prior to any appeal.Id.,at 270; seeZimmernv.United States,298\nU.S. 167, 169\u2013170 (1936) (\u201cThe judge had plenary power while\nthe term was in existence to modify his judgment [or] revoke it\naltogether\u201d).[4] Courts\nexercised that authority, we explained, \u201cin habeas corpus cases\u201d\njust as \u201cin other civil proceedings.\u201dBrowder, 434\nU.\u00a0S., at 270. In 1946, the drafters of the Federal Rules\nreplaced the \u201cterm of court\u201d power with Rule 59(e), thus\nprescribing a set number of days (then 10, now 28) in which a party\ncould move to amend a judgment. Seeid., at 271. But in our\nview, that change did nothing to narrow the set of judgments\namenable to alteration. Seeid.,at 270\u2013271. After Rule\n59(e), just as before, a district court could \u201creconsider the grant\nor denial of habeas corpus relief\u00a0\u201d in the same way it could\nreview any other decision.Id.,at 270; seeid.,at\n271. A timely Rule 59(e) motion, we held, \u201csuspend[ed] the\nfinality\u201d of any judgment, including one in habeas\u2014thus enabling a\ndistrict court to address the matter again.Id.,at 267\n(internal quotation marks omitted).[5]The record of judicial decisions accords withBrowder\u2019s view of the use of Rule 59(e) in habeas practice.\nBefore AEDPA, \u201cabuse-of-the-writ principles limit[ed] a [habeas\napplicant\u2019s] ability to file repetitive petitions.\u201dMcCleskeyv.Zant,499 U.S.\n467, 483 (1991). That doctrine was more forgiving than AEDPA\u2019s\ngatekeeping provision\u2014for example, enabling courts to hear a second\nor successive petition if the \u201cends of justice\u201d warranted doing so.Id.,at 485. But the rule against repetitive litigation\nstill had plenty of bite. It demanded the dismissal of successive\napplications except in \u201crare case[s].\u201dKuhlmannv.Wilson,477 U.S.\n436, 451 (1986) (plurality opinion). So if courts had viewed\nRule 59(e) motions as successive, there should be lots of decisions\ndismissing them on that basis. But nothing of the kind exists. In\nthe half century from Rule 59(e)\u2019s adoption (1946) throughBrowder(1978) to AEDPA\u2019s enactment (1996), we (and the\nparties) have found only one such dismissal. SeeBannisterv.Armontrout,4 F.3d 1434, 1445 (CA8 1993). In every other case, courts\nresolved Rule 59(e) motions on the merits\u2014and without any comment\nabout repetitive litigation. Mostly, courts denied the motions and\nadhered to their original judgments. See,e.g.,Gajewskiv.Stevens, 346 F.2d 1000, 1001 (CA8 1965)\n(per\u00a0curiam). Occasionally, courts decided they had\nerred in those decisions. See,e.g.,Yorkv.Tate, 858 F.2d 322, 325 (CA6 1988) (per\u00a0curiam).\nThe win-loss rate is for this point irrelevant. What matters is\nthat they all (but one) treated Rule 59(e) motions not as\nsuccessive, but as attendant on the initial habeas application.Congress passed AEDPA against this legal\nbackdrop, and did nothing to change it. AEDPA of course made the\nlimits on entertaining second or successive habeas applications\nmore stringent than before. Seesupra,at 3. But the statute\ndid not redefine what qualifies as a successive petition, much less\nplace Rule 59(e) motions in that category. Cf.Magwood, 561\nU.\u00a0S., at 336\u2013337 (distinguishing between two questions:\n\u201c\u00a72244(b)\u2019s threshold inquiry into whether an application is\n\u2018second or successive\u2019 and its subsequent inquiry into whether [to\ndismiss] a successive application\u201d). When Congress \u201cintends to\neffect a change\u201d in existing law\u2014in particular, a holding of this\nCourt\u2014it usually provides a clear statement of that objective.TC Heartland LLCv.Kraft Foods Group Brands LLC, 581\nU.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 8). AEDPA offers no such\nindication that Congress meant to change the historical practiceBrowderendorsed of applying Rule 59(e) in habeas\nproceedings.Nor do AEDPA\u2019s purposes demand a change in that\ntradition. As explained earlier, AEDPA aimed to prevent serial\nchallenges to a judgment of conviction, in the interest of reducing\ndelay, conserving judicial resources, and promoting finality. Seesupra,at 7. Nothing in Rule 59(e)\u2014a ruleBrowderdescribed as itself \u201cbased on an interest in speedy disposition and\nfinality,\u201d 434 U.\u00a0S., at 271 (internal quotation marks\nomitted)\u2014conflicts with those goals. Recall everything said above\nabout the Rule\u2019s operation. Seesupra,at 2\u20133. To begin\nwith, Rule 59(e) gives a prisoner only a narrow window to ask for\nrelief\u201428 days, with no extensions. Next, a prisoner may invoke the\nrule only to request \u201creconsideration of matters properly\nencompassed\u201d in the challenged judgment.White, 455\nU.\u00a0S., at 451. And \u201creconsideration\u201d means just that: Courts\nwill not entertain arguments that could have been but were not\nraised before the just-issued decision. A Rule 59(e) motion is\ntherefore backward-looking; and because that is so, it maintains a\nprisoner\u2019s incentives to consolidate all of his claims in his\ninitial application. Yet more, the Rule consolidates appellate\nproceedings. A Rule 59(e) motion briefly suspends finality to\nenable a district court to fix any mistakes and thereby perfect its\njudgment before a possible appeal. The motion\u2019s disposition then\nmerges into the final judgment that the prisoner may take to the\nnext level. In that way, the Rule avoids \u201cpiecemeal appellate\nreview.\u201dOsterneck, 489 U.\u00a0S., at 177. Its operation,\nrather than allowing repeated attacks on a decision, helps produce\na single final judgment for appeal.Indeed, the availability of Rule 59(e) may make\nhabeas proceedings more efficient. Most obviously, the Rule enables\na district court to reverse a mistaken judgment, and so make an\nappeal altogether unnecessary. SeeUnited Statesv.Ibarra,502 U.S.\n1, 5 (1991) (per curiam) (noting that giving district\ncourts a short time to correct their own errors \u201cprevents\nunnecessary burdens being placed on the courts of appeals\u201d). Of\ncourse, Rule 59(e) motions seldom change judicial outcomes. But\neven when they do not, they give habeas courts the chance to\nclarify their reasoning or address arguments (often made in\nless-than-limpidpro\u00a0sepetitions) passed over or\nmisunderstood before. See Brief for National Association of\nCriminal Defense Lawyers asAmicus Curiae12\u201320 (describing\nexamples). That opportunity, too, promotes an economic and\neffective appellate process, as the reviewing court gets \u201cthe\nbenefit of the district court\u2019s plenary findings.\u201dOsterneck, 489 U.\u00a0S., at 177. And when a district court\nsees no need to change a decision, the costs of permitting a Rule\n59(e) motion are typically slight. A judge familiar with a habeas\napplicant\u2019s claims can usually make quick work of a meritless\nmotion. This case may well provide an example: The District Court\ndeclined to make the State respond to Banister\u2019s motion and decided\nit within five days. Nothing in such a process conflicts with\nAEDPA\u2019s goal of streamlining habeas cases.The upshot, after AEDPA as before, is that Rule\n59(e) motions are not second or successive petitions, but instead a\npart of a prisoner\u2019s first habeas proceeding. In timing and\nsubstance, a Rule 59(e) motion hews closely to the initial\napplication; and the habeas court\u2019s disposition of the former fuses\nwith its decision on the latter. Such a motion does not enable a\nprisoner to abuse the habeas process by stringing out his claims\nover the years. It instead gives the court a brief chance to fix\nmistakes before its (single) judgment on a (single) habeas\napplication becomes final and thereby triggers the time for appeal.\nNo surprise, then, that habeas courts historically entertained Rule\n59(e) motions, rather than dismiss them as successive. Or that\nCongress said not a word about changing that familiar practice even\nwhen enacting other habeas restrictions.BTexas (along with the dissent) resists this\nconclusion on one main ground: this Court\u2019s prior decision inGonzalezv.Crosby,545 U.S.\n524(2005). The question there was whether a Rule 60(b) motion\nfor \u201crelie[f] from a final judgment\u201d denying habeas relief counts\nas a second or successive habeas application. Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.\n60(b).[6] We said that it does,\nso long as the motion \u201cattacks the federal court\u2019s previous\nresolution of a claim on the merits.\u201d 545 U.\u00a0S., at 532\n(emphasis deleted).[7] Texas\nthinks the \u201cGonzalezprinciple applies with equal force to\nRule 59(e) motions.\u201d Brief for Respondent 8. After all, the State\nargues, both Rule 59(e) and Rule 60(b) provide \u201cvehicles for\nasserting habeas claims\u201d after a district court has entered\njudgment denying relief.Id.,at 2. And ifGonzalezdoes apply, Texas concludes, Banister must lose because (as\neveryone agrees) his Rule 59(e) motion pressed only merits-based\nclaims.But Rule 60(b) differs from Rule 59(e) in just\nabout every way that matters to the inquiry here. (Contra the\ndissent\u2019s refrain, seepost,at 1, 3, 5, 6, 10, 14, the\nvariance goes far beyond their \u201clabels.\u201d) Begin, again, with\nhistory. Recall that Rule 59(e) derives from a common-law court\u2019s\nplenary power to revise its judgment during a single term of court,\nbefore anyone could appeal. Seesupra,at 7\u20138. By contrast,\nRule 60(b) codifies various writs used to seek relief from a\njudgment at any time after the term\u2019s expiration\u2014even after an\nappeal had (long since) concluded. Those mechanisms did not (as the\nterm rule did) aid the trial court to get its decision right in the\nfirst instance; rather, they served to collaterally attack its\nalready completed judgment. See Advisory Committee\u2019s 1946 Notes on\nAmendments to Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 60; Mann, Note, History and\nInterpretation of Federal Rule 60(b), 25 Temp. L. Q. 77, 78 (1951).\nAnd that distinction was not lost on pre-AEDPA habeas courts\napplying the two rules. As discussed earlier, it is practically\nimpossible to find a case dismissing a Rule 59(e) motion for\nraising repetitive claims. Seesupra,at 9. But decisions\nabound dismissing Rule 60(b) motions for that reason. See,e.g.,Williamsonv.Rison, 1993 WL 262632\n(CA9, July 9, 1993); see alsoBrewerv.Ward, 1996 WL\n194830, *1 (CA10, Apr. 22, 1996) (collecting cases from multiple\nCircuits). That is because those courts recognized Rule 60(b)\u2014as\ncontrasted to Rule 59(e)\u2014as threatening an already final judgment\nwith successive litigation.[8]The modern-day operation of the two Rules also\ndiverge, with only Rule 60(b) undermining AEDPA\u2019s scheme to prevent\ndelay and protect finality. Unlike Rule 59(e) motions with their\nfixed 28-day window, Rule 60(b) motions can arise long after the\ndenial of a prisoner\u2019s initial petition\u2014depending on the reason\ngiven for relief, within either a year or a more open-ended\n\u201creasonable time.\u201d Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 60(c)(1). InGonzalezitself, the prisoner made his motion nearly three\nyears after the habeas court\u2019s denial of relief, and more than one\nyear after his appeal ended. See 545 U.\u00a0S., at 527. Given that\nextended timespan, Rule 60(b) inevitably elicits motions that go\nbeyond Rule 59(e)\u2019s mission of pointing out the alleged errors in\nthe habeas court\u2019s decision. See,e.g.,Lopezv.Douglas,141 F.3d 974, 975 (CA10 1998) (per\u00a0curiam) (seeking\nrelief in light of a Supreme Court decision issued a decade after\njudgment);Tylerv.Anderson, 749 F.3d 499, 504\u2013505\n(CA6 2014) (seeking to raise claims that former counsel had\nneglected in a years-old habeas application). Still more, the\nappeal of a Rule 60(b) denial is independent of the appeal of the\noriginal petition. Recall that a Rule 59(e) motion suspends the\nfinality of the habeas judgment, and a decision on the former\nmerges into the latter for appellate review. Seesupra,at\n2\u20133, 10-11. By contrast, a Rule 60(b) motion \u201cdoes not affect the\n[original] judgment\u2019s finality or suspend its operation.\u201d Fed. Rule\nCiv. Proc. 60(c)(2). And an appeal from the denial of Rule 60(b)\nrelief \u201cdoes not bring up the underlying judgment for review.\u201dBrowder, 434 U.\u00a0S., at 263, n.\u00a07. Instead, that\ndenial is appealed as \u201ca separate final order.\u201dStonev.INS,514 U.S.\n386, 401 (1995).[9]In short, a Rule 60(b) motion differs from a\nRule 59(e) motion in its remove from the initial habeas proceeding.\nA Rule 60(b) motion\u2014often distant in time and scope and always\ngiving rise to a separate appeal\u2014attacks an already completed\njudgment. Its availability threatens serial habeas litigation;\nindeed, without rules suppressing abuse, a prisoner could bring\nsuch a motion endlessly. By contrast, a Rule 59(e) motion is a\none-time effort to bring alleged errors in a just-issued decision\nto a habeas court\u2019s attention, before taking a single appeal. It is\na limited continuation of the original proceeding\u2014indeed, a part of\nproducing the final judgment granting or denying habeas relief. For\nthose reasons,Gonzalezdoes not govern here. A Rule 59(e)\nmotion, unlike a Rule 60(b) motion, does not count as a second or\nsuccessive habeas application.IIIOur holding means that the Court of Appeals\nshould not have dismissed Banister\u2019s appeal as untimely. Banister\nproperly brought a Rule 59(e) motion in the District Court. As\nnoted earlier, the 30-day appeals clock runs from the disposition\nof such a motion, rather than from the initial entry of judgment.\nSeesupra,at 3. And Banister filed his notice of appeal\nwithin that time. The Fifth Circuit reached a contrary conclusion\nbecause it thought that Banister\u2019s motion was really a second or\nsuccessive habeas application, and so did not reset the appeals\nclock. For all the reasons we have given, that understanding of a\nRule 59(e) motion is wrong. We therefore reverse the judgment of\nthe Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.Notes1The complete text of the\nRule reads: \u201cA motion to alter or amend a judgment must be filed no\nlater than 28 days after the entry of the judgment.\u201d2By contrast, courts may\nconsider new arguments based on an \u201cintervening change in\ncontrolling law\u201d and \u201cnewly discovered or previously unavailable\nevidence.\u201d 11 Wright & Miller \u00a72810.1, at 161\u2013162 (3d ed.\n2012). But it is rare for such arguments or evidence to emerge\nwithin Rule 59(e)\u2019s strict 28-day timeframe.3For additional examples,\nseeSlackv.McDaniel,529 U.S.\n473, 487 (2000) (allowing a prisoner to file a second-in-time,\npost-judgment application to assert claims earlier dismissed for\nfailure to exhaust) andStewartv.Martinez-Villareal,523 U.S.\n637, 643\u2013644 (1998) (permitting a prisoner to file a\nsecond-in-time, post-judgment application to argue that he was\nincompetent to be executed).4A term of court in those\ndays was simply a period in which a court was open for business. A\nstatute or rule set the date of its commencement, and the court\nitself determined the date to adjourn. SeeUnited Statesv.Pitman,147 U.S.\n669, 670\u2013671 (1893).5The dissent\u2019s attempt to\ndismissBrowderis impossible to square with the opinion.\nMostly, the dissent claims thatBrowderis just a case about\n\u201ctime limits.\u201dPost,at 10 (opinion of Alito, J.). ButBrowderis about time limits only in the sense that this\ncase is about time limits: There, as here, the timeliness of a\nmotion depended on the broader question whether Rule 59(e) applied\nin habeas proceedings. See 434 U.\u00a0S., at 258 (\u201cIn order to\nresolve th[e] question\u201d whether the \u201cappeal was untimely,\u201d \u201cwe must\nconsider the applicability of Federal Rule[\u00a0]\u00a0 59 in\nhabeas corpus proceedings\u201d). The dissent also intimates thatBrowderwas different because there the prison warden rather\nthan the prisoner moved for reconsideration of the habeas ruling.\nSeepost,at 10, and n.\u00a02. But the Court\u2019s decision\nexplicitly addressed \u201cmotion[s\u00a0] to reconsider the grantordenial of habeas corpus relief.\u201d 434 U.\u00a0S., at 270\n(emphasis added). In other words, the identity of the\nmovant\u2014whether warden or prisoner\u2014was irrelevant.6Under Rule 60(b), a court\nmay relieve a party in civil litigation from a final judgment if\nthe party can show (1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or\nexcusable neglect; (2) certain newly discovered evidence; (3)\nfraud, misrepresentation, or misconduct by an opposing party; (4)\nvoidness of the judgment; (5) certain events that would cast doubt\non the validity or equity of continuing to apply the judgment; or\n(6) \u201cany other reason that justifies relief.\u201d Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.\n60(b)(1)\u2013(6).7By contrast,Gonzalezheld, a Rule 60(b) motion that attacks \u201csome defect\nin the integrity of the federal habeas proceedings\u201d\u2014like the\nmistaken application of a statute of limitations\u2014does not count as\na habeas petition at all, and so can proceed. 545 U.\u00a0S., at\n532. Texas concedes that ifGonzalezcontrols Rule 59(e)\nmotions, that decision\u2019s distinction between merits-based motions\nand integrity-based motions would have to apply. See Brief for\nRespondent 37. The need for a habeas court to make that\nnot-always-easy threshold determination further undermines the\nnotion\u2014already on shaky ground, seesupra, at 10\u201311\u2014that\nTexas\u2019s position would lead to any efficiency gains.8The dissent\u2019s alternative\nexplanation for this disparity does not pass muster. According to\nthe dissent, habeas courts \u201cmight have been more inclined\u201d to rule\non the merits of Rule 59(e) motions because doing so was easier:\nafter all, they (but not Rule 60(b) motions) always challenge a\njust-issued decision.Post,at 12. But another course would\nhave been easier still: throwing out the motion for raising\nrepetitive claims. And even more to the point, that course would\nusually have been required if the dissent were right that Rule\n59(e) motions counted as successive. Although pre-AEDPA courts had\nsome discretion around the edges, the consideration of successive\npetitions was supposed to be \u201crare.\u201dKuhlmannv.Wilson,477 U.S.\n436, 451 (1986) (plurality opinion); seesupra,at 9. It\nis a \u201ctall order,\u201dpost,at 12, then, to think that a half\ncentury\u2019s worth of habeas courts would have resolved Rule 59(e)\nmotions on the merits if they thought of those motions as\nsuccessive. The only plausible account of their actions is that\nthey did not.9Texas objects that if a\nRule 60(b) motion is filed within 28 days, it too suspends the\nfinality of the underlying judgment so that the denial of the\nmotion merges with that judgment on appeal. See Brief for\nRespondent 25, 28. But that is only because courts of appeals have\nlong treated Rule 60(b) motions filed within 28 days as\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. Rule 59(e) motions. See,e.g.,Skagerbergv.Oklahoma, 797 F.2d 881, 882\u2013883 (CA10\n1986) (per\u00a0curiam) (\u201cA post-judgment motion made within\n[28] days of the entry of judgment that questions the correctness\nof a judgment,\u201d however denominated, \u201cis properly construed as a\nmotion to alter or amend judgment under [Rule] 59(e)\u201d); see also\nFed. Rule App. Proc. 4(a)(4)(A)(vi) (codifying that approach by\nsetting the same appeals clock for self-styled Rule 60(b) motions\nfiled within 28 days as for Rule 59(e) motions).",
