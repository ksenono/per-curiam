The Affordable Care Act did this by, among other things,\nproviding tax credits to help people buy insurance and establishing\nonline marketplaces where insurers could sell plans. To encourage\ninsurers to enter those marketplaces, the Act created several\nprograms to defray the carriers\u2019 costs and cabin their risks.Among these initiatives was the \u201cRisk Corridors\u201d\nprogram, a temporary framework meant to compensate insurers for\nunexpectedly unprofitable plans during the marketplaces\u2019 first\nthree years. The since-expired Risk Corridors statute, \u00a71342, set a\nformula for calculating payments under the program: If an insurance\nplan loses a certain amount of money, the Federal Government \u201cshall\npay\u201d the plan; if the plan makes a certain amount of money, the\nplan \u201cshall pay\u201d the Government. See \u00a71342, 124Stat. 211\u2013212\n(codified at 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a718062). Some plans made money\nand paid the Government. Many suffered losses and sought\nreimbursement. The Government, however, did not pay.These cases are about whether\npetitioners\u2014insurers who claim losses under the Risk Corridors\nprogram\u2014have a right to payment under \u00a71342 and a damages remedy\nfor the unpaid amounts. We hold that they do. We conclude that\n\u00a71342 of the Affordable Care Act established a money-mandating\nobligation, that Congress did not repeal this obligation, and that\npetitioners may sue the Government for damages in the Court of\nFederal Claims.IAIn 2010, Congress passed the Patient\nProtection and Affordable Care Act, 124Stat. 119, seeking to\nimprove national health-insurance markets and extend coverage to\nmillions of people without adequate (or any) health insurance. To\nthat end, the Affordable Care Act called for the creation of\nvirtual health-insurance markets, or \u201cHealth Benefit Exchanges,\u201d in\neach State. 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a718031(b)(1). Individuals may buy\nhealth-insurance plans directly on an exchange and, depending on\ntheir household income, receive tax credits for doing so. 26\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a736B; 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a718081, 18082. Once\nan insurer puts a plan on an exchange, it must \u201caccept every\nemployer and individual in the State that applies for such\ncoverage,\u201d 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7300gg\u20131(a), and may not tether\npremiums to a particular applicant\u2019s health, \u00a7300gg(a). In other\nwords, the Act \u201censure[s] that anyone can buy insurance.\u201dKingv.Burwell, 576 U.S. 473, 493 (2015).Insurance carriers had many reasons to\nparticipate in these new exchanges. Through the Affordable Care\nAct, they gained access to millions of new customers with tax\ncredits worth \u201cbillions of dollars in spending each year.\u201dId., at 485. But the exchanges posed some business risks,\ntoo\u2014including a lack of \u201creliable data to estimate the cost of\nproviding care for the expanded pool of individuals seeking\ncoverage.\u201d 892 F.3d 1311, 1314 (CA Fed. 2018) (case below in No.\n18\u20131028).This uncertainty could have given carriers pause\nand affected the rates they set. So the Affordable Care Act created\nseveral risk-mitigation programs. At issue here is the Risk\nCorridors program.[2]BThe Risk Corridors program aimed to limit\nparticipating plans\u2019 profits and losses for the exchanges\u2019 first\nthree years (2014, 2015, and 2016). See \u00a71342, 124Stat. 211, 42\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a718062. It did so through a formula that\ncomputed a plan\u2019s gains or losses at the end of each year. Plans\nwith profits above a certain threshold would pay the Government,\nwhile plans with losses below that threshold would receive payments\nfrom the Government. \u00a71342(b), 124Stat. 211. Specifically, \u00a71342\nstated that the eligible profitable plans \u201cshall pay\u201d the Secretary\nof the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), while the\nSecretary \u201cshall pay\u201d the eligible unprofitable plans.Ibid.[3]When it enacted the Affordable Care Act in 2010,\nCongress did not simultaneously appropriate funds for the yearly\npayments the Secretary could potentially owe under the Risk\nCorridors program. Neither did Congress limit the amounts that the\nGovernment might pay under \u00a71342. Nor did the Congressional Budget\nOffice (CBO) \u201cscore\u201d\u2014that is, calculate the budgetary impact of\u2014the\nRisk Corridors program.In later years, the CBO noted that the Risk\nCorridors statute did not require the program to be budget neutral.\nThe CBO reported that, \u201c[i]n contrast\u201d to the Act\u2019s other\nrisk-mitigation programs, \u201crisk corridor collections (which will be\nrecorded as revenues) will not necessarily equal risk corridor\npayments, so that program can have net effects on the budget\ndeficit.\u201d CBO, The Budget and Economic Outlook: 2014 to 2024, p. 59\n(2014). The CBO thus recognized that \u201c[i]f insurers\u2019 costs exceed\ntheir expectations, on average, the risk corridor program will\nimpose costs on the federal budget.\u201dId., at 110.Like the CBO, the federal agencies charged with\nimplementing the program agreed that \u00a71342 did not require budget\nneutrality. Nine months before the program started, HHS\nacknowledged that the Risk Corridors program was \u201cnot statutorily\nrequired to be budget neutral.\u201d 78 Fed. Reg. 15473 (2013). HHS\nassured, however, that \u201c[r]egardless of the balance of payments and\nreceipts, HHS will remit payments as required under Section 1342 of\nthe Affordable Care Act.\u201dIbid.Similar guidance came from the Centers for\nMedicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the agency tasked with\nhelping the HHS Secretary collect and remit program payments. CMS\nconfirmed that a lack of payments from profitable plans would not\nrelieve the Government from making its payments to the unprofitable\nones. See 79 Fed. Reg. 30260 (2014). Citing \u201cconcerns that risk\ncorridors collections may not be sufficient to fully fund risk\ncorridors payments\u201d to the unprofitable plans, CMS declared that\n\u201c[i]n the unlikely event of a shortfall .\u00a0.\u00a0. HHS\nrecognizes that the Affordable Care Act requires the Secretary to\nmake full payments to issuers.\u201dIbid.CThe program\u2019s first year, 2014, tallied a\ndeficit of about $2.5 billion. Profitable plans owed the Government\n$362 million, while the Government owed unprofitable plans $2.87\nbillion. See CMS, Risk Corridors Payment Proration Rate for 2014\n(2015).At the end of the first year, Congress enacted a\nbill appropriating a lump sum for CMS\u2019 Program Management. See Pub.\nL. 113\u2013235, Div. G, Tit. II, 128Stat. 2130\u20132131 (providing for the\nfiscal year ending September 30, 2015). The bill included a rider\nrestricting the appropriation\u2019s effect on Risk Corridors payments\nout to issuers:\u201cNone of the funds made available by this\nAct .\u00a0.\u00a0. or transferred from other accounts funded by\nthis Act to the \u2018Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services\u2014\nProgram Management\u2019 account, may be used for payments under section\n1342(b)(1) of Public Law 111\u2013148 (relating to risk corridors).\u201d\n\u00a7227,id.,at 2491.The program\u2019s second year resembled its first.\nIn February 2015, HHS repeated its belief that \u201crisk corridors\ncollections w[ould] be sufficient to pay for all\u201d of the\nGovernment\u2019s \u201crisk corridors payments.\u201d 80 Fed. Reg. 10779 (2015).\nThe agency again \u201crecognize[d] that the Affordable Care Act\nrequires the Secretary to make full payments to issuers.\u201dIbid.\u201cIn the unlikely event that risk corridors\ncollections\u201d were \u201cinsufficient to make risk corridors payments,\u201d\nHHS reassured, the Government would \u201cuse other sources of funding\nfor the risk corridors payments, subject to the availability of\nappropriations.\u201dIbid.The 2015 program year also ran a deficit, this\ntime worth about $5.5 billion. See CMS, Risk Corridors Payment and\nCharge Amounts for the 2015 Benefit Year (2016). Facing a second\nshortfall, CMS continued to \u201crecogniz[e] that the Affordable Care\nAct requires the Secretary to make full payments to issuers.\u201d CMS,\nRisk Corridors Payments for 2015, p. 1 (2016). CMS also confirmed\nthat \u201cHHS w[ould] record risk corridors payments due as an\nobligation of the United States Government for which full payment\nis required.\u201dIbid.And at the close of the second year,\nCongress enacted another appropriations bill with the same rider as\nbefore. See Pub. L. 114\u2013113, \u00a7225, 129Stat. 2624 (providing for the\nfiscal year ending September 30, 2016).The program\u2019s final year, 2016, was similar. The\nGovernment owed unprofitable insurers about $3.95 billion more than\nprofitable insurers owed the Government. See CMS, Risk Corridors\nPayment and Charge Amounts for the 2016 Benefit Year (2017). And\nCongress passed an appropriations bill with the same rider. See\nPub. L. 115\u201331, \u00a7223, 131Stat. 543 (providing for the fiscal year\nending September 30, 2017).All told, the Risk Corridors program\u2019s deficit\nexceeded $12 billion.DThe dispute here is whether the Government\nmust pay the remaining deficit. Petitioners in these consolidated\ncases are four health-insurance companies that participated in the\nhealthcare exchanges: Maine Community Health Options, Blue Cross\nand Blue Shield of North Carolina, Land of Lincoln Mutual Health\nInsurance Company, and Moda Health Plan, Inc. They assert that\ntheir plans were unprofitable during the Risk Corridors program\u2019s\n3-year term and that, under \u00a71342, the HHS Secretary still owes\nthem hundreds of millions of dollars.These insurers sued the Federal Government for\ndamages in the United States Court of Federal Claims, invoking the\nTucker Act, 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71491. They alleged that \u00a71342 of\nthe Affordable Care Act obligated the Government to pay the full\namount of their losses as calculated by the statutory formula and\nsought a money judgment for the unpaid sums owed\u2014a claim that, if\nsuccessful, could be satisfied through the Judgment Fund.[4] These lawsuits saw mixed results in\nthe trial courts. Petitioner Moda prevailed; the others did\nnot.[5]A divided panel of the United States Court of\nAppeals for the Federal Circuit ruled for the Government in each\nappeal. See 892 F.3d 1311; 892 F.3d 1184 (2018); 729 Fed. Appx. 939\n(2018). As relevant here, the Federal Circuit concluded that \u00a71342\nhad initially created a Government obligation to pay the full\namounts that petitioners sought under the statutory formula. See\n892 F.\u00a03d, at 1320\u20131322. The court also recognized that \u201cit\nhas long been the law that the government may incur a debt\nindependent of an appropriation to satisfy that debt, at least in\ncertain circumstances.\u201dId., at 1321.Even so, the court held that Congress\u2019\nappropriations riders impliedly \u201crepealed or suspended\u201d the\nGovernment\u2019s obligation.Id., at 1322.Although the\npanel acknowledged that \u201c[r]epeals by implication are generally\ndisfavored\u201d\u2014especially when the \u201calleged repeal occurred in an\nappropriations bill\u201d\u2014it found that the riders here \u201cadequately\nexpressed Congress\u2019s intent to suspend\u201d the Government\u2019s payments\nto unprofitable plans \u201cbeyond the sum of payments\u201d it collected\nfrom profitable plans.Id., at 1322\u20131323, 1325.Judge Newman dissented, observing that the\nGovernment had not identified any \u201cstatement of abrogation or\namendment of the statute,\u201d nor any \u201cdisclaimer\u201d of the Government\u2019s\n\u201cstatutory and contractual commitments.\u201dId., at 1335. The\ndissent also reasoned that precedent undermined the court\u2019s\nconclusion and that the appropriations riders could not apply\nretroactively because the Government had used the Risk Corridors\nprogram to induce insurers to enter the exchanges.Id., at\n1336\u20131339. Emphasizing the importance of Government credibility in\npublic-private enterprise, the dissent warned that the majority\u2019s\ndecision would \u201cundermin[e] the reliability of dealings with the\ngovernment.\u201dId., at 1340.A majority of the Federal Circuit declined to\nrevisit the court\u2019s decision en banc, 908 F.3d 738 (2018)\n(per\u00a0curiam); see alsoid.,at 740 (Newman, J.,\ndissenting);id.,at 741 (Wallach, J., dissenting), and we\ngranted certiorari, 588 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2019).These cases present three questions: First, did\n\u00a71342 of the Affordable Care Act obligate the Government to pay\nparticipating insurers the full amount calculated by that statute?\nSecond, did the obligation survive Congress\u2019 appropriations riders?\nAnd third, may petitioners sue the Government under the Tucker Act\nto recover on that obligation? Because our answer to each is yes,\nwe reverse.IIThe Risk Corridors statute created a\nGovernment obligation to pay insurers the full amount set out in\n\u00a71342\u2019s formula.AAn \u201cobligation\u201d is a \u201cdefinite commitment that\ncreates a legal liability of the government for the payment of\ngoods and services ordered or received, or a legal duty\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. that could mature into a legal liability by virtue\nof actions on the part of the other party beyond the control of the\nUnited States.\u201d GAO, A Glossary of Terms Used in the Federal Budget\nProcess 70 (GAO\u201305\u2013734SP, 2005). The Government may incur an\nobligation by contract or by statute. Seeibid.Incurring an obligation, of course, is different\nfrom paying one. After all, the Constitution\u2019s Appropriations\nClause provides that \u201cNo Money shall be drawn from the Treasury,\nbut in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law.\u201d Art.\u00a0I, \u00a79,\ncl. 7; see also GAO, Principles of Federal Appropriations Law 2\u20133\n(4th ed. 2016) (hereinafter GAO Redbook) (\u201c[T]he authority to incur\nobligations by itself is not sufficient to authorize payments from\nthe Treasury\u201d). Creating and satisfying a Government obligation,\ntherefore, typically involves four steps: (1) Congress passes an\norganic statute (like the Affordable Care Act) that creates a\nprogram, agency, or function; (2) Congress passes an Act\nauthorizing appropriations; (3) Congress enacts the appropriation,\ngranting \u201cbudget authority\u201d to incur obligations and make payments,\nand designating the funds to be drawn; and (4) the relevant\nGovernment entity begins incurring the obligation. Seeid.,\nat 2\u201356; see also Op. Comp. Gen., B\u2013193573 (Dec. 19, 1979).But Congress can deviate from this pattern. It\nmay, for instance, authorize agencies to enter into contracts and\n\u201cincur obligations in advance of appropriations.\u201d GAO Redbook 2\u20134.\nIn that context, the contracts \u201cconstitute obligations binding on\nthe United States,\u201d such that a \u201cfailure or refusal by Congress to\nmake the necessary appropriation would not defeat the obligation,\nand the party entitled to payment would most likely be able to\nrecover in a lawsuit.\u201dId., at 2\u20135; see also,e.g.,Cherokee Nation of Okla. v.Leavitt,543 U.S.\n631, 636\u2013638 (2005) (rejecting the Government\u2019s argument that\nit is legally bound by its contractual promise to pay \u201cif, and only\nif, Congress appropriated sufficient funds\u201d);Salazarv.Ramah Navajo Chapter,567 U.S.\n182, 191 (2012) (\u201cAlthough the agency itself cannot disburse\nfunds beyond those appropriated to it, the Government\u2019s \u2018valid\nobligations will remain enforceable in the courts\u2019\u00a0\u201d (quoting\n2 GAO Redbook 6\u201317 (2d ed. 1992)).Congress can also create an obligation directly\nby statute, without also providing details about how it must be\nsatisfied. Consider, for example,United Statesv.Langston,118 U.S.\n389(1886). In that case, Congress had enacted a statute fixing\nan official\u2019s annual salary at \u201c$7,500 from the date of the\ncreation of his office.\u201dId., at 394. Years later, however,\nCongress failed to appropriate enough funds to pay the full amount,\nprompting the officer to sue for the remainder.Id., at 393.\nUnderstanding that Congress had created the obligation by statute,\nthis Court held that a subsequent failure to appropriate enough\nfunds neither \u201cabrogated [n]or suspended\u201d the Government\u2019s\npre-existing commitment to pay.Id., at 394. The Court thus\naffirmed judgment for the officer for the balance owed.Ibid.[6]The GAO shares this view. As the Redbook\nexplains, if Congress created an obligation by statute without\ndetailing how it will be paid, \u201can agency could presumably meet a\nfunding shortfall by such measures as making prorated payments.\u201d\nGAO Redbook 2\u201336, n. 39. But \u201csuch actions would be only temporary\npending receipt of sufficient funds to honor the underlying\nobligation\u201d and \u201c[t]he recipient would remain legally entitled to\nthe balance.\u201dIbid.Thus, the GAO warns, although a \u201cfailure\nto appropriate\u201d funds \u201cwill prevent administrative agencies from\nmaking payment,\u201d that failure \u201cis unlikely to prevent recovery by\nway of a lawsuit.\u201dId.,at 2\u201363 (citing,e.g.,Langston, 118 U.\u00a0S., at 394).Put succinctly, Congress can create an\nobligation directly through statutory language.BSection 1342 imposed a legal duty of the\nUnited States that could mature into a legal liability through the\ninsurers\u2019 actions\u2014namely, their participating in the healthcare\nexchanges.This conclusion flows from \u00a71342\u2019s express terms\nand context. See,e.g.,Merit Management Group, LPv.FTI Consulting, Inc., 583 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2018) (slip\nop., at 11) (statutory interpretation \u201cbegins with the text\u201d). The\nfirst sign that the statute imposed an obligation is its mandatory\nlanguage: \u201cshall.\u201d \u201cUnlike the word \u2018may,\u2019 which implies\ndiscretion, the word \u2018shall\u2019 usually connotes a requirement.\u201dKingdomware Technologies, Inc.v.United States, 579\nU.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 9); see alsoLexecon\nInc.v.Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach,523 U.S.\n26, 35 (1998) (observing that \u201c\u00a0\u2018shall\u2019\u00a0\u201d typically\n\u201ccreates an obligation impervious to .\u00a0.\u00a0. discretion\u201d).\nSection 1342 uses the command three times: The HHS Secretary \u201cshall\nestablish and administer\u201d the Risk Corridors program from 2014 to\n2016, \u201cshall provide\u201d for payments according to a precise statutory\nformula, and \u201cshall pay\u201d insurers for losses exceeding the\nstatutory threshold. \u00a7\u00a71342(a), (b)(1), 114Stat. 211, 42\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a718062(a), (b)(1).Section 1342\u2019s adjacent provisions also\nunderscore its mandatory nature. In \u00a71341 (a reinsurance program)\nand \u00a71343 (a risk-adjustment program), the Affordable Care Act\ndifferentiates between when the HHS Secretary \u201cshall\u201d take certain\nactions and when she \u201cmay\u201d exercise discretion. See \u00a71341(b)(2),\n124Stat. 209, 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a718061(b)(2) (\u201c[T]he Secretary\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. shall include\u201d a formula that \u201cmay be designed\u201d in\nmultiple ways); \u00a71343(b), 124Stat. 212, 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a718063(b) (\u201cThe Secretary .\u00a0.\u00a0. shall establish\u201d and \u201cmay\nutilize\u201d certain criteria). Yet Congress chose mandatory terms for\n\u00a71342. \u201cWhen,\u201d as is the case here, Congress \u201cdistinguishes between\n\u2018may\u2019 and \u2018shall,\u2019 it is generally clear that \u2018shall\u2019 imposes a\nmandatory duty.\u201dKingdomware, 579 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 9).Nothing in \u00a71342 requires the Risk Corridors\nprogram to be budget neutral, either. Nor does the text suggest\nthat the Secretary\u2019s payments to unprofitable plans pivoted on\nprofitable plans\u2019 payments to the Secretary, or that a partial\npayment would satisfy the Government\u2019s whole obligation. Thus,\nwithout \u201cany indication\u201d that \u00a71342 allows the Government to lessen\nits obligation, we must \u201cgive effect to [Section 1342\u2019s] plain\ncommand.\u201dLexecon, 523 U.\u00a0S., at 35. That is, the\nstatute meant what it said: The Government \u201cshall pay\u201d the sum that\n\u00a71342 prescribes.[7]CThe Government does not contest that \u00a71342\u2019s\nplain terms appeared to create an obligation to pay whatever amount\nthe statutory formula provides. It insists instead that the\nAppropriations Clause, Art. I, \u00a79, cl.\u00a07, and the\nAnti-Deficiency Act, 31 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71341, \u201cqualified\u201d that\nobligation by making \u201cHHS\u2019s payments contingent on appropriations\nby Congress.\u201d Brief for United States 20. \u201cBecause Congress did not\nappropriate funds beyond the amounts collected\u201d from profitable\nplans, this argument goes, \u201cHHS\u2019s statutory duty [to pay\nunprofitable plans] extended only to disbursing those collected\namounts.\u201dId., at 24\u201325.That does not follow. Neither the Appropriations\nClause nor the Anti-Deficiency Act addresses whether Congress\nitself can create or incur an obligation directly by statute.\nRather, both provisions constrain how federal employees and\nofficers may make or authorize payments without appropriations.

If anything, the\nAnti-Deficiency Act confirms that Congress can create obligations\nwithout contemporaneous funding sources: That Act\u2019s prohibitions\ngive way \u201cas specified\u201d or \u201cauthorized\u201d by \u201cany other provision of\nlaw.\u201d 31 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71341(a)(1). Here, the Government\u2019s\nobligation was authorized by the Risk Corridors statute.And contrary to the Government\u2019s view, \u00a71342\u2019s\nobligation-creating language does not turn on whether Congress\nexpressly provided \u201cbudget authority\u201d before appropriating funds.\nBudget authority is an agency\u2019s power \u201cprovided by Federal law to\nincur financial obligations,\u201d 88Stat. 297, 2 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7622(2)(A), \u201cthat will result in immediate or future outlays of\ngovernment funds,\u201d GAO Redbook 2\u20131; see alsoid., at 2\u201355\n(\u201cAgencies may incur obligations only after Congress grants budget\nauthority\u201d); GAO, A Glossary of Terms Used in the Federal Budget\nProcess, at 20\u201321. As explained above, Congress usually gives\nbudget authority through an appropriations Act or by expressly\ngranting an agency authority to contract for the Government. See\nGAO Redbook 2\u20131 to 2\u20135. But budget authority is not necessary for\nCongress itself to create an obligation by statute. SeeLangston, 118 U.\u00a0S., at 394; cf.Rainesv.Byrd,521 U.S.\n811, 815 (1997) (treating legal obligations of the Government\nas distinct from budget authority).The Government\u2019s arguments also conflict with\nwell- settled principles of statutory interpretation. At bottom,\nthe Government contends that the existence and extent of its\nobligation here is \u201csubject to the availability of appropriations.\u201d\nBrief for United States 41. But that language appears nowhere in\n\u00a71342, even though Congress could have expressly limited an\nobligation to available appropriations or specific dollar amounts.\nIndeed, Congress did so explicitly in other provisions of the\nAffordable Care Act.[8]This Court generally presumes that \u201c\u00a0\u2018when\nCongress includes particular language in one section of a statute\nbut omits it in another,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Congress \u201c\u00a0\u2018intended a\ndifference in meaning.\u2019\u00a0\u201dDigital Realty Trust, Inc.v.Somers, 583 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2018) (slip op., at 10)\n(quotingLoughrinv.United States,573 U.S.\n351, 358 (2014) (alterations omitted)).

The \u201csubject to appropriations\u201d and\npayment-capping language in other sections of the Affordable Care\nAct would be meaningless had \u00a71342 simultaneously achieved the same\nend with silence.In sum, the plain terms of the Risk Corridors\nprovision created an obligation neither contingent on nor limited\nby the availability of appropriations or other funds.IIIThe next question is whether Congress\nimpliedly repealed the obligation through its appropriations\nriders. It did not.ABecause Congress did not expressly repeal\n\u00a71342, the Government seeks to show that Congress impliedly did so.\nBut \u201crepeals by implication are not favored,\u201dMortonv.Mancari,417 U.S.\n535, 549 (1974) (internal quotation marks omitted), and are a\n\u201crarity,\u201dJ.\u00a0E.\u00a0M.\u00a0Ag Supply, Inc.v.Pioneer Hi-Bred Int\u2019l, Inc.,534 U.S.\n124, 142 (2001) (internal quotation marks omitted).

Cl. 800, 810, 369 F.2d 743, 748\n(1966). The Government must point to \u201csomething more than the mere\nomission to appropriate a sufficient sum.\u201dUnited Statesv.Vulte,233 U.S.\n509,515(1914); accord, GAO Redbook 2\u201363 (\u201cThe mere failure to appropriate\nsufficient funds is not enough\u201d). The question, then, is whether\nthe appropriations riders manifestly repealed or discharged the\nGovernment\u2019s uncapped obligation.Langstonconfirms that the appropriations\nriders did neither. Recall that inLangston, Congress had\nestablished a statutory obligation to pay a salary of $7,500, yet\nlater appropriated a lesser amount. 118 U.\u00a0S., at 393\u2013394.\nThis Court held that Congress did not \u201cabrogat[e] or suspen[d]\u201d the\nsalary-fixing statute by \u201csubsequent enactments [that] merely\nappropriated a less amount\u201d than necessary to pay, because the\nappropriations bill lacked \u201cwords that expressly or by clear\nimplication modified or repealed the previous law.\u201dId., at\n394.Vultereaffirmed that a mere failure to\nappropriate does not repeal or discharge an obligation to pay. At\nissue there was whether certain appropriations Acts had repealed a\nGovernment obligation to pay bonuses to military servicemen. 233\nU.\u00a0S., at 511\u2013512. A 1902 statute had provided a 10 percent\nbonus to officers serving outside the contiguous United States, but\nin 1906 and 1907, Congress enacted appropriations funding the\nbonuses for officers \u201cexcept [those in] P[ue]rto Rico and Hawaii.\u201dId., at 512. Then, in 1908, Congress enacted a statute\nstating \u201c\u00a0\u2018[t]hat the increase of pay .\u00a0.\u00a0. shall be\nas now provided by law.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId., at 513. When Lieutenant\nNelson Vulte sought a bonus for his service in Puerto Rico from\n1908 to 1909, the Government refused, contending that the\nappropriations Acts had impliedly repealed its obligation\naltogether.Relying onLangston,Vulterejected that argument. \u201c[I]t is to be remembered,\u201d the Court\nwrote, that the alleged repeals \u201cwere in appropriation acts and no\nwords were used to indicate any other purpose than the disbursement\nof a sum of money for the particular fiscal years.\u201d 233 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 514. At most, the appropriations had \u201ctemporarily suspend[ed]\u201d\npayments, but they did not use \u201c\u00a0\u2018the most clear and positive\nterms\u2019\u00a0\u201d required to \u201cmodif[y] or repea[l]\u201d the Government\u2019s\nobligation itself.Id.,at 514\u2013515 (quotingMinisv.United States, 15 Pet. 423, 445 (1841)). Because the\nGovernment had failed to show that repeal was the only\n\u2018\u00a0\u201creasonable interpretation\u2019\u00a0\u201d of the appropriation\nActs, the obligation persisted. 233 U.\u00a0S., at 515 (quotingMinis, 15 Pet., at 445).The parallels amongLangston,Vulte, and these cases are clear. Here, like inLangstonandVulte, Congress \u201cmerely appropriated a\nless amount\u201d than that required to satisfy the Government\u2019s\nobligation, without \u201cexpressly or by clear implication modif[ying]\u201d\nit.Langston, 118 U.\u00a0S., at 394; see alsoVulte,\n233 U.\u00a0S., at 515. The riders stated that \u201c[n]one of the funds\nmade available by this Act,\u201d as opposed to any other sources of\nfunds, \u201cmay be used for payments under\u201d the Risk Corridors statute.\n\u00a7227, 128Stat. 2491; accord, \u00a7225, 129Stat. 2624; \u00a7223, 131Stat.\n543. But \u201cno words were used to indicate any other purpose than the\ndisbursement of a sum of money for the particular fiscal years.\u201dVulte, 233 U.\u00a0S., at 514. And especially because the\nGovernment had already begun incurring the prior year\u2019s obligation\neach time Congress enacted a rider, reasonable (and nonrepealing)\ninterpretations exist. Indeed, finding a repeal in these\ncircumstances would raise serious questions whether the\nappropriations riders retroactively impaired insurers\u2019 rights to\npayment. SeeLandgrafv.USI Film Products,511 U.S.\n244, 265\u2013266, 280 (1994); see also GAO Redbook 1\u201361 to\n1\u201362.The relevant agencies\u2019 responses to the riders\nalso undermine the case for an implied repeal here. Had Congress\n\u201cclearly expressed\u201d its intent to repeal, one might have expected\nHHS or CMS to signal the sea change.Morton, 417 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 551. But even after Congress enacted the first rider, the\nagencies reiterated that \u201cthe Affordable Care Act requires the\nSecretary to make full payments to issuers,\u201d 80 Fed. Reg. 10779,\nand that \u201cHHS w[ould] record risk corridors payments due as an\nobligation of the United States Government for which full payment\nis required,\u201d CMS, Risk Corridors Payments for 2015, at 1. They\nunderstood that profitable insurers\u2019 payments to the Government\nwould not dispel the Secretary\u2019s obligation to pay unprofitable\ninsurers, even \u201cin the event of a shortfall.\u201dIbid.Given the Court\u2019s potent presumption in the\nappropriations context, an implied-repeal-by-rider must be made of\nsterner stuff.BTo be sure, this Court\u2019s implied-repeal\nprecedents reveal two situations where the Court has deemed\nappropriations measures irreconcilable with statutory obligations\nto pay. But neither one applies here.The first line of cases involved appropriations\nbills that, without expressly invoking words of \u201crepeal,\u201d reached\nthat outcome by completely revoking or suspending the underlying\nobligation before the Government began incurring it. SeeUnited\nStatesv.Will,449 U.S.\n200(1980);United Statesv.Dickerson,310 U.S.\n554(1940).Willconcluded that Congress had canceled an\nobligation to pay cost-of- living raises through appropriations\nbills that bluntly stated that future raises \u201c\u00a0\u2018shall not take\neffect\u2019\u00a0\u201d or that restricted funds from \u201c\u00a0\u2018this Act or\nany other Act.\u2019\u00a0\u201d 449 U.\u00a0S., at 206\u2013207, 223.[9] Likewise,Dickersonheld that\na series of appropriations bills repealed an obligation to pay\nmilitary-reenlistment bonuses due in particular fiscal years. See\n310 U.\u00a0S., at 561. One enactment \u201c\u00a0\u2018hereby\nsuspended\u2019\u00a0\u201d the bonuses before they took effect, and another\n\u201ccontinued\u201d this suspension for additional years, providing that\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018no part of any appropriation in this or any other Act for\nthe [next] fiscal year .\u00a0.\u00a0. shall be available for the\npayment [of the bonuses] notwithstanding\u2019\u00a0\u201d the statute\ncreating the Government\u2019s obligation to pay.Id., at\n555\u2013557.Here, by contrast, the appropriations riders did\nnot use the kind of \u201cshall not take effect\u201d language decisive inWill. See 449 U.\u00a0S., at 222\u2013223. Nor did the riders\npurport to \u201csuspen[d]\u201d \u00a71342 prospectively or to foreclose funds\nfrom \u201cany other Act\u201d \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d \u00a71342\u2019s money-mandating\ntext.Dickerson, 310 U.\u00a0S., at 556\u2013557; see alsoWill, 449 U.\u00a0S., at 206\u2013207. NeitherWillnorDickersonsupports the Federal Circuit\u2019s implied-repeal\nholding.The second strand of precedent turned on\nprovisions that reformed statutory payment formulas in ways\n\u201cirreconcilable\u201d with the original methods. SeeUnited\nStatesv.Mitchell,109 U.S.\n146,150(1883); see alsoUnited Statesv.Fisher,109 U.S.\n143, 145\u2013146 (1883). InMitchell, an appropriations bill\ndecreased the salaries for federal interpreters (from $400 to $300)\nand changed how the agency would distribute any \u201c\u00a0\u2018additional\npay\u2019\u00a0\u201d (from \u201c\u00a0\u2018all emoluments and allowances\nwhatsoever\u2019\u00a0\u201d to payments at the agency head\u2019s discretion).\n109 U.\u00a0S., at 147, 149. And inFisher, Congress altered\nan obligation to pay judges $3,000 per year by providing that a\nlesser appropriation would be \u201c\u00a0\u2018in full compensation\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nfor services rendered in the next fiscal year. 109 U.\u00a0S., at\n144.[10]The appropriations bills here created no such\nconflict as inMitchellandFisher. The riders did\nnot reference \u00a71342\u2019s payment formula at all, let alone\n\u201cirreconcilabl[y]\u201d change it.Mitchell, 109 U.\u00a0S., at\n150. Nor did they provide that Risk Corridors payments from\nprofitable plans would be \u201c\u00a0\u2018in full compensation\u2019\u00a0\u201d of\nthe Government\u2019s obligation to unprofitable plans.Fisher,\n109 U.\u00a0S., at 146. Instead, the riders here must be taken at\nface value: as a \u201cmere omission to appropriate a sufficient sum.\u201dVulte, 233 U.\u00a0S., at 515. Congress could have used the\nkind of language we have held to effect a repeal or\nsuspension\u2014indeed, it did so in other provisions of the relevant\nappropriations bills. See,e.g.,\u00a7716, 128Stat. 2163 (\u201cNone\nof the funds appropriated or otherwise made available by this or\nany other Act shall be used .\u00a0.\u00a0. \u201d); \u00a7714, 129Stat. 2275\n(same); \u00a7714, 131Stat. 168 (same). But for the Risk Corridors\nprogram, it did not.CWe also find unpersuasive the only pieces of\nlegislative history that the Federal Circuit cited. According to\nthe Court of Appeals, a floor statement and an unpublished GAO\nletter provided \u201cclear intent\u201d to cancel or \u201csuspend\u201d the\nGovernment\u2019s Risk Corridors obligation. See 892 F.\u00a03d, at\n1318\u20131319, 1325\u20131326. We doubt that either source could ever evince\nthe kind of clear congressional intent required to repeal a\nstatutory obligation through an appropriations rider. SeeUnited\nStatesv.Kwai Fun Wong, 575 U.S. 402, 412 (2015). But\neven if they could, they did not do so here.The floor statement (which Congress adopted as\nan \u201cexplanatory statement\u201d) does not cross the clear-expression\nthreshold. See 160 Cong. Rec. 17805, 18307 (2014); see also \u00a74,\n128Stat. 2132. That statement interpreted an HHS regulation as\nsaying that \u201cthe risk corridor program will be budget neutral,\nmeaning the federal government will never pay out more than it\ncollects.\u201d 160 Cong. Rec., at 18307.[11] But that misunderstands the referenced regulation,\nwhich provided only that HHS \u201cproject[ed]\u201d that the program would\nbe budget neutral and that the agency \u201cintend[ed]\u201d to treat it that\nway, while making clear that \u201cit [was] difficult to estimate\u201d the\n\u201caggregate risk corridors payments and charges at [the] time.\u201d 79\nFed. Reg. 13829. HHS\u2019 goals did not alter its prior interpretation\nthat the Risk Corridors program was \u201cnot statutorily required to be\nbudget neutral.\u201d 78 Fed. Reg. 15473. And neither the floor\nstatement nor the appropriations rider said anything requiring\nbudget neutrality or redefining \u00a71342\u2019s formula.[12]The GAO letter is even more inapt. In it, the\nGAO responded to two legislators\u2019 inquiry by identifying two\nsources of available funding for the first year of Risk Corridors\npayments: CMS\u2019 appropriations for the 2014 fiscal year and\nprofitable insurance plans\u2019 payments to the Secretary. 892\nF.\u00a03d, at 1318; see also App. in No. 17\u20131994 (CA Fed.), pp.\n234\u2013240. Because the rider cut off the first source of funds, the\nFederal Circuit inferred congressional intent \u201cto temporarily cap\u201d\nthe Government\u2019s payments \u201cat the amount of payments\u201d profitable\nplans made \u201cfor each of the applicable years\u201d of the Risk Corridors\nprogram. 892 F.\u00a03d, at 1325. That was error. The letter has\nlittle value because it appears nowhere in the legislative record.\nPerhaps for that reason, the Government does not rely on it.IVHaving found that the Risk Corridors statute\nestablished a valid yet unfulfilled Government obligation, this\nCourt must turn to a final question: Where does petitioners\u2019\nlawsuit belong, and for what relief? We hold that petitioners\nproperly relied on the Tucker Act to sue for damages in the Court\nof Federal Claims.AThe United States is immune from suit unless\nit unequivocally consents.United Statesv.Navajo\nNation,556 U.S.\n287, 289 (2009). The Government has waived immunity for certain\ndamages suits in the Court of Federal Claims through the Tucker\nAct, 24Stat. 505. SeeUnited Statesv.Mitchell,463 U.S.\n206, 212 (1983). That statute permits \u201cclaim[s] against the\nUnited States founded either upon the Constitution, or any Act of\nCongress or any regulation of an executive department, or upon any\nexpress or implied contract with the United States, or for\nliquidated or unliquidated damages in cases not sounding in tort.\u201d\n28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71491(a)(1).The Tucker Act, however, does not create\n\u201csubstantive rights.\u201dNavajo Nation, 556 U.\u00a0S., at 290.\nA plaintiff relying on the Tucker Act must premise her damages\naction on \u201cother sources of law,\u201d like \u201cstatutes or contracts.\u201dIbid.For that reason, \u201c[n]ot every claim invoking the\nConstitution, a federal statute, or a regulation is cognizable\nunder the Tucker Act.\u201dMitchell, 463 U.\u00a0S., at 216. Nor\nwill every \u201cfailure to perform an obligation .\u00a0.\u00a0.\ncreat[e] a right to monetary relief\u00a0\u201d against the Government.United Statesv.Bormes,568 U.S.\n6, 16 (2012).To determine whether a statutory claim falls\nwithin the Tucker Act\u2019s immunity waiver, we typically employ a\n\u201cfair interpretation\u201d test. A statute creates a \u201cright capable of\ngrounding a claim within the waiver of sovereign immunity if, but\nonly if, it \u2018can fairly be interpreted as mandating compensation by\nthe Federal Government for the damage sustained.\u2019\u00a0\u201dUnited\nStatesv.White Mountain Apache Tribe,537 U.S.\n465, 472 (2003) (quotingMitchell, 463 U.\u00a0S., at\n217)); see alsoNavajo Nation, 556 U.\u00a0S., at 290 (\u201cThe\nother source of law need notexplicitlyprovide that the\nright or duty it creates is enforceable through a suit for\ndamages\u201d). Satisfying this rubric is generally both necessary and\nsufficient to permit a Tucker Act suit for damages in the Court of\nFederal Claims.White Mountain Apache, 537 U.\u00a0S., at\n472\u2013473.[13]But there are two exceptions. The Tucker Act\nyields when the obligation-creating statute provides its own\ndetailed remedies, or when the Administrative Procedure Act,\n60Stat. 237, provides an avenue for relief. SeeBormes, 568\nU.\u00a0S., at 13, 16;Bowenv.Massachusetts,487 U.S.\n879, 900\u2013908 (1988).BPetitioners clear each hurdle: The Risk\nCorridors statute is fairly interpreted as mandating compensation\nfor damages, and neither exception to the Tucker Act applies.1Rarely has the Court determined whether a\nstatute can \u201cfairly be interpreted as mandating compensation by the\nFederal Government.\u201dMitchell, 463 U.\u00a0S., at 216\u2013217\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Likely this is because\nso-called money-mandating provisions are uncommon, see M. Solomson,\nCourt of Federal Claims: Jurisdiction, Practice, and Procedure 4\u201318\n(2016), and because Congress has at its disposal several blueprints\nfor conditioning and limiting obligations, see n.\u00a07,supra; see also GAO Redbook 2\u201322 to 2\u201324, 2\u201354 to 2\u201358. But\nCongress used none of those tools in \u00a71342. The Risk Corridors\nstatute is one of the rare laws permitting a damages suit in the\nCourt of Federal Claims.Here again \u00a71342\u2019s mandatory text is\nsignificant. Statutory \u201c\u00a0\u2018shall pay\u2019 language\u201d often reflects\ncongressional intent \u201cto create both a right and a remedy\u201d under\nthe Tucker Act.Bowen, 487 U.\u00a0S., at 906, n. 42; see\nalso,e.g., id., at 923 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (\u201c[A]\nstatute commanding the payment of a specified amount of money by\nthe United States impliedly authorizes (absent other indication) a\nclaim for damages in the defaulted amount\u201d);United Statesv.Testan,424 U.S.\n392, 404 (1976) (suggesting that the Back Pay Act,\n5\u00a0U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a75596, may permit damages suits under the\nTucker Act \u201cin carefully limited circumstances\u201d);Mitchell,\n463 U.\u00a0S., at 217 (similar). Section 1342\u2019s triple\nmandate\u2014that the HHS Secretary \u201cshall establish and administer\u201d the\nprogram, \u201cshall provide\u201d for payment according to the statutory\nformula, and \u201cshall pay\u201d qualifying insurers\u2014falls comfortably\nwithin the class of money- mandating statutes that permit recovery\nof money damages in the Court of Federal Claims.Bolstering our finding is \u00a71342\u2019s focus on\ncompensating insurers for past conduct. In assessing Tucker Act\nactions, this Court has distinguished statutes that \u201cattempt to\ncompensate a particular class of persons for past injuries or\nlabors\u201d from laws that \u201csubsidize future state expenditures.\u201dBowen, 487 U.\u00a0S., at 906, n. 42. (The first group\npermits Tucker Act suits; the second does not.) The Risk Corridors\nstatute sits securely in the first category: It uses a\nbackwards-looking formula to compensate insurers for losses\nincurred in providing healthcare coverage for the prior\nyear.[14]2Nor is there a separate remedial scheme\nsupplanting the Court of Federal Claims\u2019 power to adjudicate\npetitioners\u2019 claims.True, the Tucker Act \u201cis displaced\u201d when \u201ca law\nassertedly imposing monetary liability on the United States\ncontains its own judicial remedies.\u201dBormes, 568 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 12. A plaintiff in that instance cannot rely on our \u201cfair\ninterpretation\u201d test, and instead must stick to the money-\nmandating statute\u2019s \u201cowntext\u201d to \u201cdetermine whether the\ndamages liability Congress crafted extends to the Federal\nGovernment.\u201dId., at 15\u201316. Examples include the Fair Credit\nReporting Act, 84Stat. 1127, and the Agricultural Marketing\nAgreement Act of 1937, 50Stat. 246. The former superseded the\nTucker Act by creating a cause of action, imposing a statute of\nlimitations, and providing subject-matter jurisdiction in federal\ndistrict courts. See 15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a71681n, 1681o,\n1681p;Bormes, 568 U.\u00a0S., at 15. And the latter did so\nby allowing aggrieved parties to petition the Secretary of\nAgriculture and by paving a path for judicial review. See 7\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7608c(15);Hornev.Department of\nAgriculture,569 U.S.\n513, 527 (2013).Unlike those statutes, however, the Affordable\nCare Act did not establish a comparable remedial scheme. Nor has\nthe Government identified one. So this exception to the Tucker Act\nis no barrier here.Neither does the Administrative Procedure Act\nbar petitioners\u2019 Tucker Act suit. To be sure, inBowen, this\nCourt held in the Medicaid context that a State properly sued the\nHHS Secretary under the Administrative Procedure Act (not the\nTucker Act) in district court (not the Court of Federal Claims) for\nfailure to make statutorily required payments. See 487 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 882\u2013887, 901\u2013905.ButBowenis distinguishable on several\nscores. First, the relief requested there differed materially from\nwhat petitioners pursue here. InBowen, the State did not\nseek money damages, but instead sued for prospective declaratory\nand injunctive relief to clarify the extent of the Government\u2019s\nongoing obligations under the Medicaid program. Unlike \u00a71342, which\n\u201cprovide[s] compensation for specific instances of past injuries or\nlabors,\u201did., at 901, n. 31, the pertinent Medicaid\nprovision was a \u201cgrant-in-aid program,\u201d which \u201cdirect[ed] the\nSecretary .\u00a0.\u00a0. to subsidize future state expenditures,\u201did., at 906, n. 42. Thus, the suit inBowen\u201cwas not\nmerely for past due sums, but for an injunction to correct the\nmethod of calculating payments going forward.\u201dGreat-West Life\n& Annuity Ins. Co.v.Knudson,534 U.S.\n204, 212 (2002). And because the Court of Federal Claims \u201cdoes\nnot have the general equitable powers of a district court to grant\nprospective relief,\u201d 487 U.\u00a0S., at 905, the Court reasoned\nthatBowenbelonged in district court.Second, the parties\u2019 relationship inBowenalso differs from the one implicated here. The State\nhad employed the Administrative Procedure Act inBowenbecause of the litigants\u2019 \u201ccomplex ongoing relationship,\u201d which\nmade it important that a district court adjudicate future disputes.Id., at 905; see alsoid., at 900, n. 31. The Court\nadded that the Administrative Procedure Act \u201cis tailored\u201d to\n\u201c[m]anaging the relationships between States and the Federal\nGovernment that occur over time and that involve constantly\nshifting balance sheets,\u201d while the Tucker Act is suited to\n\u201cremedy[ing] particular categories of past injuries or labors for\nwhich various federal statutes provide compensation.\u201dId.,\nat 904\u2013905, n. 39.These observations confirm that petitioners\nproperly sued the Government in the Court of Federal Claims.\nPetitioners\u2019 prayer for relief under the Risk Corridors statute\nlooks nothing like the requested redress inBowen.\nPetitioners do not ask for prospective, nonmonetary relief to\nclarify future obligations; they seek specific sums already\ncalculated, past due, and designed to compensate for completed\nlabors. The Risk Corridors statute and Tucker Act allow them that\nremedy. And because the Risk Corridors program expired years ago,\nthis litigation presents no special concern about managing a\ncomplex ongoing relationship or tracking ever-changing accounting\nsheets. Petitioners\u2019 suit thus lies in the Tucker Act\u2019s\nheartland.[15]VIn establishing the temporary Risk Corridors\nprogram, Congress created a rare money-mandating obligation\nrequiring the Federal Government to make payments under \u00a71342\u2019s\nformula. And by failing to appropriate enough sums for payments\nalready owed, Congress did simply that and no more: The\nappropriation bills neither repealed nor discharged \u00a71342\u2019s unique\nobligation. Lacking other statutory paths to relief, and absent aBowenbarrier, petitioners may seek to collect payment\nthrough a damages action in the Court of Federal Claims.[16]These holdings reflect a principle as old as the\nNation itself: The Government should honor its obligations. Soon\nafter ratification, Alexander Hamilton stressed this insight as a\ncornerstone of fiscal policy. \u201cStates,\u201d he wrote, \u201cwho observe\ntheir engagements .\u00a0.\u00a0. are respected and trusted: while\nthe reverse is the fate of those .\u00a0.\u00a0. who pursue an\nopposite conduct.\u201d Report Relative to a Provision for the Support\nof Public Credit (Jan. 9, 1790), in 6 Papers of Alexander Hamilton\n68 (H. Syrett & J. Cooke eds. 1962). Centuries later, this\nCourt\u2019s case law still concurs.The judgments of the Court of Appeals are\nreversed, and the cases are remanded for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.Notes1*\u00a0Justice Thomas and\nJustice Gorsuch join all but Part III\u2013C of this\nopinion.2The others were the\n\u201cReinsurance\u201d and \u201cRisk Adjustment\u201d programs. The former ran from\n2014 to 2016 and required insurers to pay premiums into a pool that\ncompensated carriers covering \u201chigh risk individuals.\u201d \u00a71341,\n124Stat. 208, 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a718061. The latter is still in\neffect and annually transfers funds from insurance plans with\nrelatively low-risk enrollees to plans with higher risk enrollees.\nSee \u00a71343, 124Stat. 212, 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a718063.3If a health insurance\nplan made (or lost) up to 3 percentage points more than expected in\na plan year, the plan would keep the gains (or losses). If the plan\nmade (or lost) between 3 and 8 percentage points more than\npredicted, it would give up half of the earnings (or would be\ncompensated for half of the shortfalls) exceeding the 3\npercentage-point threshold. If the gains (or losses) exceeded\npredictions by eight percentage points, the insurers would pay (or\nreceive) 80 percent of the gains (or losses) exceeding the 8\npercentage-point mark. See \u00a71342(b), 124Stat. 211, 42\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a718062(b).4For a meritorious claim\nbrought within the Tucker Act\u2019s 6-year statute of limitations, 28\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72501, federal law generally requires that the\n\u201cfinal judgment rendered by the United States Court of Federal\nClaims against the United States .\u00a0.\u00a0. be paid out of any\ngeneral appropriation therefor.\u201d \u00a72517(a). The Judgment Fund is a\npermanent and indefinite appropriation for \u201c[n]ecessary amounts\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. to pay final judgments, awards, compromise\nsettlements, and interest and costs specified in the judgments or\notherwise authorized by law when .\u00a0.\u00a0. payment is not\notherwise provided for.\u201d 31 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a71304(a)(1).5Compare 130 Fed. Cl. 436\n(2017) (granting Moda Health Plan partial summary judgment on its\nstatutory and implied-in-fact-contract claims), with 129 Fed. Cl.\n81 (2016) (dismissing Land of Lincoln\u2019s statutory, contract, and\nTakings Clause claims), 131 Fed. Cl. 457 (2017) (dismissing Blue\nCross Blue Shield\u2019s statutory and contract claims), and 133 Fed.\nCl. 1 (2017) (dismissing Maine Community Health\u2019s statutory\nclaims).6The Government suggests\nthatLangstonis irrelevant because that case predates the\nJudgment Fund, cf. n. 3,supra, meaning that the Court \u201chad\nno occasion\u201d to determine whether the statute at issue \u201cauthorized\na money-damages remedy\u201d against the Government, Brief for United\nStates 30. But by affirming a judgment against the United States,Langstonnecessarily confirmed the Government\u2019s obligation\nto pay independent of a specific appropriation. What remedies\nensure that the Government makes good on its duty to pay is a\nseparate question that we take up below. See Part IV,infra.7Our conclusion matches\nthe interpretations that HHS and CMS have repeated since before the\nRisk Corridors program began. In the agencies\u2019 view, the Risk\nCorridors program was \u201cnot statutorily required to be budget\nneutral\u201d and instead required HHS to \u201cremit payments\u201d \u201c[r]egardless\nof the balance of payments and receipts.\u201d 78 Fed. Reg. 15473 (HHS\nregulation); accord, 79 Fed.

These common limitations\u2014and our\ndiscussion below, see Part IV,infra\u2014diminish the dissent\u2019s\nconcern that other statutes may support a damages action in the\nCourt of Federal Claims.Post,at 3 (opinion of Alito,\nJ.).9Still,Willheld\nunconstitutional the changes that purported to reduce the\nGovernment\u2019s payment obligations after the obligation-creating\nstatutes had already taken effect. See 449 U.\u00a0S., at 224\u2013226,\n230.10The\nFederal Circuit has also recognized that Congress may override a\nstatutory payment formula through an appropriation that expressly\nearmarks a lesser amount for that payment obligation in the\nupcoming fiscal year. SeeHighland Falls-Fort Montgomery Central\nSchool Dist.v.United States,48 F.3d 1166, 1169\u20131171 (1995); see also GAO Redbook 2\u201362\n(discussingHighland Fallsand noting that earmarking a\nlesser amount can create an \u201cirreconcilable conflict\u201d with a\nstatutory payment formula). Perhaps because these cases do not\ninvolve an earmark to satisfy an incompatible payment formula, the\nFederal Circuit did not rely onHighland Fallsbelow.11The\nstatement provides in full: \u201cIn 2014, HHS issued a regulation\nstating that the risk corridorprogram will be budget neutral,\nmeaning that the federal government will never pay out more than it\ncollects from issuers over the three year period risk corridors are\nin effect. The agreement includes new bill language to prevent the\nCMS Program Management appropriation account from being used to\nsupport risk corridors payments.\u201d 160 Cong. Rec., at\n18307.12In\nthis implied-repeal context, it is also telling that\nCongressconsidered\u2014but did not enact\u2014bills containing the type of\ntext that may have satisfied the clear-expression rule. Seee.g.,Obamacare Taxpayer Bailout Protection Act, S. 2214,\n113th Cong., 2d Sess., \u00a72 (2014) (\u201c\u00a0\u2018[T]he Secretary shall\nensure that payments out and payments in .\u00a0.\u00a0. are\nprovided for in amounts that the Secretary determines are necessary\nto reduce to zero the cost .\u00a0.\u00a0. to the Federal\nGovernment of carrying out the program under this section\u2019\u00a0\u201d);\nTaxpayer Bailout Protection Act, S. 359, 114th Cong., 1st Sess., \u00a72\n(2015) (\u201c\u00a0\u2018The Secretary shall ensure that the amount of\npayments to plans .\u00a0.\u00a0. does not exceed the amount of\npayments to the Secretary\u2019\u00a0\u201d and \u201c\u00a0\u2018shall proportionately\ndecrease the amount of payments to plans\u2019\u00a0\u201d); Taxpayer Bailout\nProtection Act, H.

Seepost,at 2, 4\u20137. We have\nrepeatedly rejected that notion\u2014including in opinions written bySandoval\u2019s author. See,e.g.,United Statesv.Bormes,568 U.S.\n6, 15\u201316 (2012);United Statesv.Navajo Nation,556 U.S.\n287, 290 (2009). Not evenSandovalwent as far as the\ndissent; that decision instead explained that \u201c[t]he judicial task\nis to interpret the statute Congress has passed to determine\nwhether it displays an intent to create not just a private right\nbut also a private remedy.\u201d 532 U.\u00a0S., at 286. That is\nprecisely what the money-mandating inquiry does: It provides a\nframework for determining when Congress has authorized a claim\nagainst the Government. This framework also makes good sense. Cf.post, at 4. As the author ofSandovalexplained, if a\nstatutory obligation to pay money is mandatory, then the\ncongressionally conferred \u201cright to receive money,\u201dpost,at\n8, n.\u00a05, will typically display an intent to provide a damages\nremedy for the defaulted amount,Bowenv.Massachusetts,487 U.S.\n879, 923 (1988) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (a \u201cstatute commanding\nthe payment of a specified amount of money by the United States\nimpliedly authorizes (absent other indication) a claim for damages\nin the defaulted amount\u201d). As this Court recently observed,\nCongress enacted the Tucker Act to \u201csuppl[y] the missing ingredient\nfor an action against the United States for the breach of monetary\nobligations not otherwise judicially enforceable.\u201dBormes,\n568 U.\u00a0S., at 12. By the dissent\u2019s contrary suggestion, not\nonly is a mandatory statutory obligation to pay meaningless, so too\nis a constitutional one. After all, the Constitution did not\n\u201cexpressly create .\u00a0.\u00a0. a right of action,\u201dpost,at 3, when it mandated \u201cjust compensation\u201d for Government takings\nof private property for public use, Amdt. 5; see alsoFirst\nEnglish Evangelical Lutheran Church of Glendalev.County of\nLos Angeles,482 U.S.\n304, 315\u2013316 (1987). Although there is no express cause of\naction under the Takings Clause, aggrieved owners can sue through\nthe Tucker Act under our case law.E.g., Ruckelshausv.Monsanto Co.,467 U.S.\n986, 1016\u20131017 (1984) (citingUnited Statesv.Causby,328 U.S.\n256, 267 (1946)).14Despite agreeing that \u201c[t]he Court is\ncorrect\u201d on the case law, the dissent proposes supplemental\nbriefing and re-argument.Post,at 4, 8. We underscore,\nhowever, that all Members of this Court agree that today\u2019s cases do\nnot break new doctrinal ground. The Federal Circuit, moreover,\nconcurs in our conclusion. 892 F.\u00a03d, 1311, 1320, n.\u00a02\n(2018) (holding that \u00a71342 \u201cis money-mandating for [Tucker Act]\npurposes\u201d (citingGreenlee Countyv.United States,\n487 F.3d 871, 877 (CA Fed. 2007))). It also agrees with our\nanalysis broadly, having held that \u201cshall pay\u201d language \u201cgenerally\nmakes a statute money-mandating\u201d under the Tucker Act.Id.,\nat 877 (internal quotation marks omitted). Conversely, the Court of\nAppeals has concluded that a statute is not money mandating where\nthe Government enjoys \u201ccomplete discretion\u201d in determining whether\n(and whom) to pay. See,e.g., Doev.United States,463 F.3d 1314, 1324 (2006) (noting that the statutoryterm,\n\u201cmay,\u201d creates a rebuttable presumption that the \u201cstatute creates\ndiscretion\u201d).15The\ndissent concedes that there may \u201cbe some sharply defined categories\nof claims that may be properly asserted\u201d through the TuckerAct\n\u201csimply as a matter of precedent.\u201dPost,at 6, and\nnn.\u00a03, 4 (citing takings, breach-of-contract,\nfailure-to-pay-compensation, and breach-of-fiduciary-duty claims as\nexamples). Petitioners\u2019 claim\u2014breach of anunambiguous statutory\npromise to pay for services rendered to theGovernment\u2014fits easily\nwithin those precedents. The only differences the dissent seems to\nassert here are that the dollar figure is higher and that\npetitioners do not deserve a \u201cbailout\u201d for their \u201cbet\u201d that the\nFederal Government would comply with federal law.Post,at\n2, 3, 7; but cf.,e.g.,79 Fed. Reg. 30260 (assuring\ninsurers with \u201cconcerns that risk corridors collections may not be\nsufficient to fully fund risk corridors payments\u201d that the\nGovernment would still pay). Our analysis in Tucker Act cases has\nnever revolved on such results-oriented reasoning.16Having found that the Risk Corridors\nstatute is a money-mandating provision for which a Tucker Act suit\nlies, we need not resolve petitioners\u2019 alternative arguments for\nrecovery based on an implied-in-fact contract theory or under the\nTakings Clause.",
