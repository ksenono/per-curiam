MEACHAM, et\u00a0al., PETITIONERSv.KNOLLS ATOMIC POWER LABORATORY, aka KAPL, INC.,\net\u00a0al.on writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the second circuit[June 19, 2008]Justice Thomas, concurring in\npart and dissenting in part.I write separately to note that I\ncontinue to believe that disparate-impact claims are not cognizable\nunder the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, 29 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a7621et seq. SeeSmithv.City of\nJackson,544 U.\nS. 228, 247\u2013268 (2005) (O\u2019Connor, J., joined by Kennedy and\nThomas, JJ., concurring in judgment). Moreover, I disagree with the\nCourt\u2019s statement that the \u201creasonable factors other than age\u201d\n(RFOA) exception, \u00a7623(f)(1), is principally relevant in\ndisparate-impact cases. CompareCity of Jackson,supra, at 251\u2013253 (opinion concurring in judgment), withante, at 10\u201311 (citingCity of Jackson,supra, at 239 (plurality opinion)). I therefore join only\nParts I and II\u2013A of the Court\u2019s opinion because I agree that the\nRFOA exception is an affirmative defense\u2014when it arises in\ndisparate-treatment cases. Here, although the Court of Appeals\nerred in placing the burden of proof on petitioners, I would\nnonetheless affirm because the only claims at issue are\ndisparate-impact claims.",
