    "text": "OPINION OF THE COURTCARLSBAD TECHNOLOGY, INC. V. HIF BIO, INC.556 U. S. ____ (2009)SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESNO. 07-1437CARLSBAD TECHNOLOGY, INC., PETITIONERv.HIF BIO, INC., et\u00a0al.on writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the federal circuit[May 4, 2009]Justice Thomas delivered the\nopinion of the Court.In this case, we decide whether a\nfederal court of appeals has jurisdiction to review a district\ncourt\u2019s order that remands a case to state court after declining to\nexercise supplemental jurisdiction over state-law claims under 28\nU. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71367(c). The Court of Appeals for the Federal\nCircuit held that appellate review of such an order is barred by\n\u00a71447(d) because it viewed the remand order in this case as resting\non the District Court\u2019s lack of subject-matter jurisdiction over\nthe state-law claims. We disagree and reverse the judgment of the\nCourt of Appeals.IIn 2005, respondents filed a\ncomplaint against petitioner and others in California state court,\nalleging that petitioner had violated state and federal law in\nconnection with a patent dispute. Petitioner removed the case to\nthe United States District Court for the Central District of\nCalifornia pursuant to \u00a71441(c), which allows removal of an \u201centire\ncase\u201d when it includes at least one claim over which the federal\ndistrict court has original jurisdiction. Petitioner then filed a\nmotion to dismiss the only federal claim in the lawsuit, which\narose under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act\n(RICO), 18 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a71961\u20131968, for failure to adequately\nallege a pattern of racketeering.HIF Bio, Inc.v.Yung Shin Pharmaceuticals Indus. Co., 508 F.\u00a03d 659,\n662 (CA Fed. 2007). The District Court agreed that respondents had\nfailed to state a RICO claim upon which relief could be granted and\ndismissed the claim pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n12(b)(6). The District Court also declined to exercise supplemental\njurisdiction over the remaining state-law claims pursuant to 28 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a71367(c)(3), which provides that a district court \u201cmay\ndecline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over a claim\u201d if \u201cthe\ndistrict court has dismissed all claims over which it has original\njurisdiction.\u201d The District Court then remanded the case to state\ncourt as authorized by this Court\u2019s decision inCarnegie-Mellon\nUniv.v.Cohill,484 U. S. 343(1988).Petitioner appealed to the United\nStates Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, arguing that the\nDistrict Court should have exercised supplemental jurisdiction over\nthe state-law claims because they implicate federal patent-law\nrights. 508 F. 3d, at 663. The Court of Appeals dismissed the\nappeal, finding that the remand order could \u201cbe colorably\ncharacterized as a remand based on lack of subject matter\njurisdiction\u201d and, therefore, could not be reviewed under \u00a7\u00a71447(c)\nand (d), which provide in part that remands for \u201clack of subject\nmatter jurisdiction\u201d are \u201cnot reviewable on appeal or otherwise.\u201d\nSeeid.,at 667.This Court has not yet decided whether a\ndistrict court\u2019s order remanding a case to state court after\ndeclining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction is a remand for\nlack of subject-matter jurisdiction for which appellate review is\nbarred by \u00a7\u00a71447(c) and (d). SeePowerex Corp.v.Reliant Energy Services, Inc.,551 U. S. 224, 235, n. 4\n(2007) (\u201cWe have never passed on whetherCohillremands\nare subject-matter jurisdictional for purposes of \u2026 \u00a71447(c) and\n\u00a71447(d)\u201d). We granted certiorari to resolve this question, 555 U.\nS. ___ (2008), and now hold that such remand orders are not based\non a lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. Accordingly, we reverse\nthe judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand for further\nproceedings.IIAppellate review of remand orders\nis limited by 28 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71447(d), which states:\u201cAn order remanding a case to the\nState court from which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal\nor otherwise, except that an order remanding a case to the State\ncourt from which it was removed pursuant to section 1443 of this\ntitle shall be reviewable by appeal or otherwise.\u201dThis Court has consistently held that \u00a71447(d) must\nbe readin pari materiawith \u00a71447(c), thus limiting the\nremands barred from appellate review by \u00a71447(d) to those that are\nbased on a ground specified in \u00a71447(c). SeeThermtron\nProducts, Inc.v.Hermansdorfer,423 U. S. 336, 345\u2013346\n(1976); see alsoPowerex,supra,at 229;Quackenbushv.Allstate Ins. Co.,517 U. S. 706, 711\u2013712\n(1996);Things Remembered, Inc.v.Petrarca,516 U. S. 124,\n127 (1995).*One type of remand order governed by\n\u00a71447(c)\u2014the type at issue in this case\u2014is a remand order based on\na lack of \u201csubject matter jurisdiction.\u201d \u00a71447(c) (providing, in\nrelevant part, that \u201c[i]f at any time before final judgment it\nappears that the district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction,\nthe case shall be remanded\u201d). The question presented in this case\nis whether the District Court\u2019s remand order, which rested on its\ndecision declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over\nrespondents\u2019 state-law claims, is a remand based on a \u201clack of\nsubject matter jurisdiction\u201d for purposes of \u00a7\u00a71447(c) and (d). It\nis not.\u201cSubject matter jurisdiction defines the\ncourt\u2019s authority to hear a given type of case,\u201dUnited\nStatesv.Morton,467 U. S. 822, 828\n(1984); it represents \u201cthe extent to which a court can rule on the\nconduct of persons or the status of things.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary\n870 (8th ed. 2004). This Court\u2019s precedent makes clear that whether\na court has subject-matter jurisdiction over a claim is distinct\nfrom whether a court chooses to exercise that jurisdiction. See,e.g., Quackenbush,supra,at 712 (holding that an\nabstention-based remand is not a remand for \u201clack of subject matter\njurisdiction\u201d for purposes of \u00a7\u00a71447(c) and (d));Ankenbrandtv.Richards,504 U. S. 689, 704\n(1992) (questioning whether, \u201ceven though subject matter\njurisdiction might be proper, sufficient grounds exist to warrant\nabstention from the exercise of that jurisdiction\u201d);Iowa Mut.\nIns. Co.v.LaPlante,480 U. S. 9, 16, n. 8\n(1987) (referring to exhaustion requirement as \u201ca matter of comity\u201d\nthat does \u201cnot deprive the federal courts of subject-matter\njurisdiction\u201d but does \u201crende[r] it appropriate for the federal\ncourts to decline jurisdiction in certain circumstances\u201d).With respect to supplemental jurisdiction in\nparticular, a federal court has subject-matter jurisdiction over\nspecified state-law claims, which it may (or may not) choose to\nexercise. See \u00a7\u00a71367(a), (c). A district court\u2019s decision whether\nto exercise that jurisdiction after dismissing every claim over\nwhich it had original jurisdiction is purely discretionary. See\n\u00a71367(c) (\u201cThe district courtsmaydecline to exercise\nsupplemental jurisdiction over a claim \u2026 if \u2026 the district court\nhas dismissed all claims over which it has original jurisdiction\u201d\n(emphasis added));Osbornv.Haley,549 U. S. 225, 245\n(2007) (\u201cEven if only state-law claims remained after resolution of\nthe federal question, the District Court would have discretion,\nconsistent with Article III, to retain jurisdiction\u201d);Arbaughv.Y & H Corp.,546 U. S. 500, 514\n(2006) (\u201c[W]hen a court grants a motion to dismiss for failure to\nstate a federal claim, the court generally retains discretion to\nexercise supplemental jurisdiction, pursuant to 28 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a71367, over pendent state-law claims\u201d); see also 13D C. Wright, A.\nMiller, E. Cooper, & R. Freer, Federal Practice and Procedure\n\u00a73567.3, pp. 428\u2013432 (3d ed. 2008) (\u201cOnce it has dismissed the\nclaims that invoked original bases of subject matter jurisdiction,\nall that remains before the federal court are state-law\nclaims\u2026\u00a0. The district court retains discretion to exercise\nsupplemental jurisdiction [over them]\u201d). As a result, \u201cthe\n[district] court\u2019s exercise of its discretion under \u00a71367(c) is not\na jurisdictional matter. Thus, the court\u2019s determination may be\nreviewed for abuse of discretion, but may not be raised at any time\nas a jurisdictional defect.\u201d 16 J. Moore et\u00a0al., Moore\u2019s\nFederal Practice \u00a7106.05[4], p. 106\u201327 (3d ed. 2009).It is undisputed that when this case was\nremoved to federal court, the District Court had original\njurisdiction over the federal RICO claim pursuant to 28 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a71331 and supplemental jurisdiction over the state-law\nclaims because they were \u201cso related to claims in the action within\nsuch original jurisdiction that they form[ed] part of the same case\nor controversy under Article III of the United States\nConstitution.\u201d \u00a71367(a). Upon dismissal of the federal claim, the\nDistrict Court retained its statutory supplemental jurisdiction\nover the state-law claims. Its decision declining to exercise that\nstatutory authority was not based on a jurisdictional defect but on\nits discretionary choice not to hear the claims despite its\nsubject-matter jurisdiction over them. SeeChicagov.International College of Surgeons,522 U. S. 156, 173\n(1997) (\u201cDepending on a host of factors, then\u2014including the\ncircumstances of the particular case, the nature of the state law\nclaims, the character of the governing state law, and the\nrelationship between the state and federal claims\u2014district courts\nmay decline to exercise jurisdiction over supplemental state law\nclaims\u201d). The remand order, therefore, is not based on a \u201clack of\nsubject matter jurisdiction\u201d for purposes of the bar to appellate\nreview created by \u00a7\u00a71447(c) and (d).The Court of Appeals held to the contrary\nbased on its conclusion that \u201cevery \u00a71367(c) remand necessarily\ninvolves a predicate finding that the claims at issue lack an\nindependent basis of subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d 508 F. 3d, at\n667. But, as explained above, \u00a7\u00a71367(a) and (c) provide a basis for\nsubject-matter jurisdiction over any properly removed state claim.\nSeeOsborn,supra,at 245;Arbaugh,supra,at 514. We thus disagree with the Court of Appeals\nthat the remand at issue here \u201ccan be colorably characterized as a\nlack of subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d 508 F. 3d, at 667.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*When a district court remands\nclaims to a state court after declining to exercise supplemental\njurisdiction, the remand order is not based on a lack of\nsubject-matter jurisdiction for purposes of \u00a7\u00a71447(c) and (d). The\njudgment of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit is\nreversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.*\u00a0We do not revisit today whetherThermtronwas correctly decided. Neither the brief for\npetitioner nor the brief for respondents explicitly asked the Court\nto do so here, and counsel for both parties clearly stated at oral\nargument that they were not asking forThermtronto be\noverruled. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 16, 22; cf.South Central Bell\nTelephone Co.v.Alabama,526 U. S. 160, 171\n(1999). We also note that the parties inPowerex,Quackenbush, andThings Remembereddid not ask\nforThermtronto be overruled.",
