S. ____ (2007)SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESNO. 06-134THE PERMANENT MISSION OF INDIA TO THE UNITED\nNATIONS, et\u00a0al., PETITIONERSv.CITY OF NEW YORK, NEW\nYORKon writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the second circuit[June 14, 2007]Justice Thomas delivered the\nopinion of the Court.The Foreign Sovereign Immunities\nAct of 1976 (FSIA), 28 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71602et seq.,governs federal courts\u2019 jurisdiction in lawsuits against foreign\nsovereigns. Today, we must decide whether the FSIA provides\nimmunity to a foreign sovereign from a lawsuit to declare the\nvalidity of tax liens on property held by the sovereign for the\npurpose of housing its employees. We hold that the FSIA does not\nimmunize a foreign sovereign from such a suit.IThe Permanent Mission of India to\nthe United Nations is located in a 26-floor building in New York\nCity that is owned by the Government of India. Several floors are\nused for diplomatic offices, but approximately 20 floors contain\nresidential units for diplomatic employees of the mission and their\nfamilies. The employees\u2014all of whom are below the rank of Head of\nMission or Ambassador\u2014are Indian citizens who receive housing from\nthe mission rent free.Similarly, the Ministry for\nForeign Affairs of the People\u2019s Republic of Mongolia is housed in a\nsix-story building in New York City that is owned by the Mongolian\nGovernment. Like the Permanent Mission of India, certain floors of\nthe Ministry Building include residences for lower level employees\nof the Ministry and their families.Under New York law, real property owned by a\nforeign government is exempt from taxation if it is \u201cused\nexclusively\u201d for diplomatic offices or for the quarters of a\ndiplomat \u201cwith the rank of ambassador or minister plenipotentiary\u201d\nto the United Nations. N.\u00a0Y. Real Prop. Tax Law Ann. \u00a7418\n(West 2000). But \u201c[i]f a portion only of any lot or building \u2026 is\nused exclusively for the purposes herein described, then such\nportion only shall be exempt and the remainder shall be subject to\ntaxation\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dIbid.For several years, the City of New York (City)\nhas levied property taxes against petitioners for the portions of\ntheir buildings used to house lower level employees. Petitioners,\nhowever, refused to pay the taxes. By operation of New York law,\nthe unpaid taxes eventually converted into tax liens held by the\nCity against the two properties. As of February 1, 2003, the Indian\nMission owed about $16.4 million in unpaid property taxes and\ninterest, and the Mongolian Ministry owed about $2.1 million.On April 2, 2003, the City filed complaints in\nstate court seeking declaratory judgments to establish the validity\nof the tax liens.[Footnote 1]\nPetitioners removed their cases to federal court, pursuant to 28 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a71441(d), which provides for removal by a foreign state\nor its instrumentality. Once there, petitioners argued that they\nwere immune from the suits under the FSIA\u2019s general rule of\nimmunity for foreign governments. \u00a71604. The District Court\ndisagreed, relying on the FSIA\u2019s \u201cimmovable property\u201d exception,\nwhich provides that a foreign state shall not be immune from\njurisdiction in any case in which \u201crights in immovable property\nsituated in the United States are in issue.\u201d \u00a71605(a)(4).Reviewing the District Court\u2019s decision under\nthe collateral order doctrine, a unanimous panel of the Court of\nAppeals for the Second Circuit affirmed. 446 F.\u00a03d 365 (2006).\nThe Court of Appeals held that the text and purpose of the FSIA\u2019s\nimmovable property exception confirmed that petitioners\u2019 personal\nproperty tax obligations involved \u201crights in immovable property.\u201d\nIt therefore held that the District Court had jurisdiction to\nconsider the City\u2019s suits. We granted certiorari, 549 U. S. ___\n(2007), and now affirm.II\u201c[T]he FSIA provides the sole\nbasis for obtaining jurisdiction over a foreign state in federal\ncourt.\u201dArgentine Republicv.Amerada Hess Shipping\nCorp.,488 U.\nS. 428, 439 (1989). Under the FSIA, a foreign state is\npresumptively immune from suit unless a specific exception applies.\n\u00a71604;Saudi Arabiav.Nelson,507 U. S. 349, 355\n(1993). At issue here is the scope of the exception where \u201crights\nin immovable property situated in the United States are in issue.\u201d\n\u00a71605(a)(4). Petitioners contend that the language \u201crights in\nimmovable property\u201d limits the reach of the exception to actions\ncontesting ownership or possession. The City argues that the\nexception encompasses additional rights in immovable property,\nincluding tax liens. Each party claims international practice at\nthe time of the FSIA\u2019s adoption supports its view. We agree with\nthe City.AWe begin, as always, with the\ntext of the statute.Limtiacov.Camacho, 549 U.\nS. ___, ___ (2007) (slip op., at 5). The FSIA provides: \u201cA foreign\nstate shall not be immune from the jurisdiction of courts of the\nUnited States \u2026 in any case \u2026 in which \u2026 rights in immovable\nproperty situated in the United States are in issue.\u201d 28 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a71605(a)(4). Contrary to petitioners\u2019 position,\n\u00a71605(a)(4) does not expressly limit itself to cases in which the\nspecific right at issue is title, ownership, or possession. Neither\ndoes it specifically exclude cases in which the validity of a lien\nis at issue. Rather, the exception focuses more broadly on \u201crights\nin\u201d property. Accordingly, we must determine whether an action\nseeking a declaration of the validity of a tax lien places \u201crights\nin immovable property \u2026 in issue.\u201dAt the time of the FSIA\u2019s\nadoption in 1976, a \u201clien\u201d was defined as \u201c[a] charge or security\nor incumbrance upon property.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1072 (4th ed.\n1951). \u201cIncumbrance,\u201d in turn, was defined as \u201c[a]ny right to, or\ninterest in, land which may subsist in another to the diminution of\nits value . . . .\u201dId.,at 908; see alsoid.,at\n941 (8th ed. 2004) (defining \u201clien\u201d as a \u201clegal right or interest\nthat a creditor has in another\u2019s property\u201d). New York law defines\n\u201ctax lien\u201d in accordance with these general definitions. See\nN.\u00a0Y. Real Prop. Tax Law Ann. \u00a7102(21) (West Supp. 2007)\n(\u201c\u00a0\u2018Tax lien\u2019 means an unpaid tax \u2026 which is an encumbrance of\nreal property\u00a0\u2026\u201d). This Court, interpreting the Bankruptcy\nCode, has also recognized that a lienholder has a property\ninterest, albeit a \u201cnonpossessory\u201d interest.United Statesv.Security Industrial Bank,459 U. S. 70, 76\n(1982).The practical effects of a lien bear out these\ndefinitions of liens as interests in property. A lien on real\nproperty runs with the land and is enforceable against subsequent\npurchasers. See 5 Restatement of Property \u00a7540 (1944). As such, \u201ca\nlien has an immediate adverse effect upon the amount which [could\nbe] receive[d] on a sale,\u00a0\u2026 constitut[ing] a direct\ninterference with the property\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dRepublic of\nArgentinav.New York, 25 N.\u00a0Y. 2d 252, 262, 250\nN.\u00a0E. 2d 698, 702 (1969). A tax lien thus inhibits one of the\nquintessential rights of property ownership\u2014the right to convey. It\nis therefore plain that a suit to establish the validity of a lien\nimplicates \u201crights in immovable property.\u201dBOur reading of the text is\nsupported by two well-recognized and related purposes of the FSIA:\nadoption of the restrictive view of sovereign immunity and\ncodification of international law at the time of the FSIA\u2019s\nenactment. Until the middle of the last century, the United States\nfollowed \u201cthe classical or virtually absolute theory of sovereign\nimmunity,\u201d under which \u201ca sovereign cannot, without his consent, be\nmade a respondent in the courts of another sovereign.\u201d Letter from\nJack B. Tate, Acting Legal Adviser, U. S. Dept. of State, to Acting\nU. S. Attorney General Phillip B. Perlman (May 19, 1952) (Tate\nLetter), reprinted in 26 Dept. of State Bull. 984 (1952), and inAlfred Dunhill of London, Inc.v.Republic of\nCuba,425 U. S.\n682, 711, 712 (1976) (App. 2 to opinion of the Court). The Tate\nLetter announced the United States\u2019 decision to join the majority\nof other countries by adopting the \u201crestrictive theory\u201d of\nsovereign immunity, under which \u201cthe immunity of the sovereign is\nrecognized with regard to sovereign or public acts(jure\nimperii)of a state, but not with respect to private acts(jure gestionis).\u201dId.,at 711. In enacting the\nFSIA, Congress intended to codify the restrictive theory\u2019s\nlimitation of immunity to sover- eign acts.Republic of\nArgentinav.Weltover, Inc.,504 U. S. 607, 612\n(1992);Asociacion de Reclamantesv.United Mexican\nStates,735 F.\u00a02d 1517, 1520 (CADC 1984) (Scalia,\nJ.).As a threshold matter, property ownership is\nnot an inherently sovereign function. SeeSchooner\nExchangev.McFaddon, 7 Cranch 116, 145 (1812) (\u201cA\nprince, by acquiring private property in a foreign country, may\npossibly be considered as subjecting that property to the\nterritorial jurisdiction, he may be considered as so far laying\ndown the prince, and assuming the character of a private\nindividual\u201d). In addition, the FSIA was also meant \u201cto codify \u2026 the\npre-existing real property exception to sovereign immunity\nrecognized by international practice.\u201dReclamantes,supra, at 1521 (Scalia, J.). Therefore, it is useful to\nnote that international practice at the time of the FSIA\u2019s\nenactment also supports the City\u2019s view that these sovereigns are\nnot immune. The most recent restatement of foreign relations law at\nthe time of the FSIA\u2019s enactment states that a foreign sovereign\u2019s\nimmunity does not extend to \u201can action to obtain possession of or\nestablish a property interest in immovable property located in the\nterritory of the state exercising jurisdiction.\u201d Restatement\n(Second) of Foreign Relations Law of the United States \u00a768(b),\np.\u00a0205 (1965). As stated above, because an action seeking the\ndeclaration of the validity of a tax lien on property is a suit to\nestablish an interest in such property, such an action would be\nallowed under this rule.Petitioners respond to this\nconclusion by citing the second sentence of Commentdto\n\u00a768, which states that the rule \u201cdoes not preclude immunity with\nrespect to a claim arising out of a foreign state\u2019s ownership or\npossession of immovable property but not contesting such ownership\nor the right to possession.\u201dId.,at 207. According to\npetitioners, that sentence limits the exception to cases contesting\nownership or possession. When read in context, however, the comment\nsupports the City. Petitioners ignore the first sentence of the\ncomment, which reemphasizes that immunity does not extend to cases\ninvolving the possession of or \u201cinterest in\u201d the property.Ibid.And the illustrations following the comment make\nclear that it refers only to claims incidental to property\nownership, such as actions involving an \u201cinjury suffered in a fall\u201d\non the property, for which immunity would apply.Id.,at\n208. By contrast, for an eminent-domain proceeding, the foreign\nsovereign could not claim immunity.Ibid.Like the\neminent-domain proceeding, the City\u2019s lawsuits here directly\nimplicate rights in property.In addition, both parties rely on various\ninternational agreements, primarily the Vienna Convention on\nDiplomatic Relations, Apr. 18, 1961, [1972] 23 U. S.\u00a0T. 3227,\nT.\u00a0I.\u00a0A.\u00a0S. No. 7502, to identify pre-FSIA\ninternational practice. Petitioners point to the Vienna\nConvention\u2019s analogous withholding of immunity for \u201ca real action\nrelating to private immovable property situated in the territory of\nthe receiving State, unless [the diplomatic agent] holds it on\nbehalf of the sending State for the purposes of the mission.\u201dId.,at 3240, Art. 31(1)(a). Petitioners contend that this\nlanguage indicates they are entitled to immunity for two reasons.\nFirst, petitioners argue that \u201creal action[s]\u201d do not include\nactions for performance of obligations \u201c\u00a0\u2018deriving from\nownership or possession of immovable property.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Brief for\nPetitioners 28 (quoting E. Denza, Diplomatic Law: A Commentary on\nthe Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations 238 (2d ed. 1998);\nemphasis deleted). Second, petitioners assert that the property\nhere is held \u201c\u00a0\u2018on behalf of the sending State for purposes of\nthe Mission.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Brief for Petitioners 28.But as the City shows, it is far from apparent\nthat the term \u201creal action\u201d\u2014a term derived from the civil law\u2014is as\nlimited as petitioners suggest. SeeChateau Lafayette\nApartments, Inc.v.Meadow Brook Nat. Bank, 416\nF.\u00a02d 301, 304, n.\u00a07 (CA5 1969). Moreover, the exception\nfor property held \u201con behalf of the sending State\u201d concerns only\nthe case\u2014not at issue here\u2014where local law requires an agent to\nhold in his own name property used for the purposes of a mission.\n1957 Y.\u00a0B. Int\u2019l L. Comm\u2019n 94\u201395 (402d Meeting, May 22, 1957);\nsee alsoDeputy Registrar Case, 94 I.\u00a0L.\u00a0R. 308,\n313 (D.\u00a0Ct. The Hague 1980). Other tribunals construing\nArticle 31 have also held that it does not extend immunity to staff\nhousing. Seeid.,at 312; cf.Intpro Properties\n(U.\u00a0K.) Ltd.v.Sauvel, [1983] 1 Q.\u00a0B.\n1019, 1032\u20131033.In sum, the Vienna Convention does not\nunambiguously support either party on the jurisdictional\nquestion.[Footnote 2] In any\nevent, nothing in the Vienna Convention deters us from our\ninterpretation of the FSIA. Under the language of the FSIA\u2019s\nexception for immovable property, petitioners are not immune from\nthe City\u2019s suits.IIIBecause the statutory text and\nthe acknowledged purposes of the FSIA make it clear that a suit to\nestablish the validity of a tax lien places \u201crights in immovable\nproperty \u2026 in issue,\u201d we affirm the judgment of the Court of\nAppeals and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with\nthis opinion.It is so ordered.Footnote 1The City concedes that even if a court of\ncompetent jurisdiction declares the liens valid, petitioners are\nimmune from foreclosure proceedings. See Brief for Respondent 40\n(noting that there is no FSIA immunity exception for enforcement\nactions). The City claims, however, that the declarations of\nvalidity are necessary for three reasons. First, once a court has\ndeclared property tax liens valid, foreign sovereigns traditionally\nconcede and pay. Second, if the foreign sovereign fails to pay in\nthe face of a valid court judgment, that country\u2019s foreign aid may\nbe reduced by the United States by 110% of the outstanding debt.\nSee Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs\nAppropriations Act, 2006, \u00a7543(a), 119 Stat. 2214 (hereinafter\nForeign Operations); Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2005,\n\u00a7543(a), 118 Stat. 3011 (hereinafter Consolidated Appropriations).\nThird, the liens would be enforceable against subsequent\npurchasers. 5 Restatement of Property \u00a7540 (1944).Footnote 2The City offers several other arguments\nagainst immunity based on the Vienna Convention, but those\narguments ultimately go to the merits of the case,i.e.,\nwhether petitioners are actually responsible for paying the taxes.\nBecause the only question before us is one of jurisdiction, and\nbecause the text and historical context of the FSIA demonstrate\nthat petitioners are not immune from the City\u2019s suits, we leave\nthese merits-related arguments to the lower courts.",
