LANE, PETITIONER v. STEVE FRANKS, in\nhis individual capacity, and SUSAN BURROW, in her official capacity\nas ACTING PRESIDENT OF CENTRALALABAMA COMMUNITYCOLLEGEon writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the eleventh circuit[June 19, 2014]Justice Sotomayor\ndelivered the opinion of the Court.Almost 50 years ago,\nthis Court declared that citizens do not surrender their First\nAmendment rights by accepting public employment. Rather, the First\nAmendment protection of a public employee\u2019s speech depends on a\ncareful balance \u201cbetween the interests of the [employee], as a\ncitizen, in commenting upon matters of public concern and the\ninterest of the State, as an employer, in promoting the efficiency\nof the public services it performs through its employees.\u201d\nPickering v. Board of Ed. of Township High School Dist. 205, Will\nCty., 391 U.\u00a0S. 563, 568 (1968) . In Pickering, the Court\nstruck the balance in favor of the public employee, extending First\nAmendment protection to a teacher who was fired after writing a\nletter to the editor of a local newspaper criticizing the school\nboard that employed him. Today, we consider whether the First\nAmendment similarly protects a public employee who provided\ntruthful sworn testimony, compelled by sub-poena, outside the\ncourse of his ordinary job responsibilities. We hold that it\ndoes.IIn 2006, Central\nAlabama Community College (CACC) hired petitioner Edward Lane to be\nthe Director of Community Intensive Training for Youth (CITY), a\nstatewide program for underprivileged youth. CACC hired Lane on a\nprobationary basis. In his capacity as Director, Lane was\nresponsible for overseeing CITY\u2019s day-to-day operations, hiring and\nfiring employees, and making decisions with respect to the\nprogram\u2019s finances.At the time of Lane\u2019s\nappointment, CITY faced significant financial difficulties. That\nprompted Lane to conduct a comprehensive audit of the program\u2019s\nexpenses. The audit revealed that Suzanne Schmitz, an Alabama State\nRepresentative on CITY\u2019s payroll, had not been reporting to her\nCITY office. After unfruitful discussions with Schmitz, Lane shared\nhis finding with CACC\u2019s president and its attorney. They warned him\nthat firing Schmitz could have negative repercussions for him and\nCACC.Lane nonetheless\ncontacted Schmitz again and in-structed her to show up to the\nHuntsville office to serveas a counselor. Schmitz refused; she\nresponded that shewished to \u201c\u00a0\u2018continue to serve the CITY\nprogram in the same manner as [she had] in the past.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Lane\nv. Central Ala. Community College, 523 Fed. Appx. 709, 710 (CA11\n2013) (per curiam). Lane fired her shortly thereafter. Schmitz told\nanother CITY employee, Charles Foley, that she intended to\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018get [Lane] back\u2019\u00a0\u201d for firing her. 2012 WL 5289412, *1\n(ND Ala., Oct. 18, 2012). She also said that if Lane ever requested\nmoney from the state legislature for the program, she would tell\nhim, \u201c\u00a0\u2018[y]ou\u2019re fired.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Ibid.Schmitz\u2019 termination\ndrew the attention of many, including agents of the Federal Bureau\nof Investigation, which initiated an investigation into Schmitz\u2019\nemployment with CITY. In November 2006, Lane testified before a\nfederal grand jury about his reasons for firing Schmitz. In January\n2008, the grand jury indicted Schmitz on four counts of mail fraud\nand four counts of theft concerning a program receiving federal\nfunds. See United States v. Schmitz, 634 F.\u00a03d 1247, 1256\u20131257\n(CA11 2011). The indictment alleged that Schmitz had collected\n$177,251.82 in federal funds even though she performed\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018virtually no services,\u2019\u00a0\u201d \u201c\u00a0\u2018generated virtually\nno work product,\u2019\u00a0\u201d and \u201c\u00a0\u2018rarely even appeared for work\nat the CITY Program offices.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Id., at 1260. It further\nalleged that Schmitz had submitted false statements concerning the\nhours she worked and the nature of the services she performed. Id.,\nat 1257.Schmitz\u2019 trial, which\ngarnered extensive press coverage,[1] commenced in August 2008. Lane testified, under\nsubpoena, regarding the events that led to his terminating Schmitz.\nThe jury failed to reach a verdict. Roughly six months later,\nfederal prosecutors retried Schmitz, and Lane testified once again.\nThis time, the jury convicted Schmitz on three counts of mail fraud\nand four countsof theft concerning a program receiving federal\nfunds. The District Court sentenced her to 30 months in prison and\nordered her to pay $177,251.82 in restitution and forfeiture.Meanwhile, CITY\ncontinued to experience considerable budget shortfalls. In November\n2008, Lane began reporting to respondent Steve Franks, who had\nbecome president of CACC in January 2008. Lane recommended that\nFranks consider layoffs to address the financial difficulties. In\nJanuary 2009, Franks decided to terminate 29 probationary CITY\nemployees, including Lane. Shortly thereafter, however, Franks\nrescinded all but 2 of the 29 terminations\u2014those of Lane and one\nother employee\u2014 because of an \u201cambiguity in [those other\nemployees\u2019] probationary service.\u201d Brief for Respondent Franks 11.\nFranks claims that he \u201cdid not rescind Lane\u2019s\ntermination\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0because he believed that Lane\nwas in a fundamentally different category than the other employees:\nhe was the director of the entire CITY program, and not simply an\nemployee.\u201d Ibid. In September 2009, CACC eliminated the CITY\nprogram and terminated the program\u2019s remaining employees. Franks\nlater retired, and respondent Susan Burrow, the current Acting\nPresident of CACC, replaced him while this case was pending before\nthe Eleventh Circuit.In January 2011, Lane\nsued Franks in his individual and official capacities under Rev.\nStat. \u00a71979, 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71983, alleging that Franks had\nviolated the First Amendment by firing him in retaliation for his\ntestimony against Schmitz.[2]\nLane sought damages from Franks in his individual capacity and\nsought equitable relief, including reinstatement, from Franks in\nhis official capacity.[3]The District Court\ngranted Franks\u2019 motion for summary judgment. Although the court\nconcluded that the record raised \u201cgenuine issues of material fact\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. concerning [Franks\u2019] true motivation for\nterminating [Lane\u2019s] employment,\u201d 2012 WL 5289412, *6, it held that\nFranks was entitled to qualified immunity as to the damages claims\nbecause \u201ca reasonable government official in [Franks\u2019] position\nwould not have had reason to believe that the Constitution\nprotected [Lane\u2019s] testimony,\u201d id., *12. The District Court relied\non Garcetti v. Ceballos, 547 U.\u00a0S. 410 (2006) , which held\nthat \u201c\u00a0\u2018when public employees make statements pursuant to\ntheir official duties, the employees are not speaking as citizens\nfor First Amendment pur-poses.\u2019\u00a0\u201d 2012 WL 5289412, *10\n(quoting Garcetti, 547 U.\u00a0S.,at 421). The court found no\nviolation of clearly established law because Lane had \u201clearned of\nthe information that he testified about while working as Director\nat [CITY],\u201d such that his \u201cspeech [could] still be considered as\npart of his official job duties and not made as a citizen on a\nmatter of public concern.\u201d 2012 WL 5289412, *10.The Eleventh Circuit\naffirmed. 523 Fed. Appx., at 710. Like the District Court, it\nrelied extensively on Garcetti. It reasoned that, \u201c[e]ven if an\nemployee was not required to make the speech as part of his\nofficial duties, he enjoys no First Amendment protection if his\nspeech \u2018owes its existence to [the] employee\u2019s professional\nresponsibilities\u2019 and is \u2018a product that the \u201cemployer himself has\ncommissioned or created.\u201d\u00a0\u2019\u00a0\u201d Id., at 711 (quoting\nAbdur-Rahman v. Walker, 567 F.\u00a03d 1278, 1283 (CA11 2009)). The\ncourt concluded that Lane spoke as an employee and not as a citizen\nbecause he was acting pursuant to his official duties when he\ninvestigated Schmitz\u2019 employment, spoke with Schmitz and CACC\nofficials regarding the issue, and terminated Schmitz. 523 Fed.\nAppx., at 712. \u201cThat Lane testified about his official activities\npursuant to a sub-poena and in the litigation context,\u201d the court\ncontinued,\u201cdoes not bring Lane\u2019s speech within the protection of\nthe First Amendment.\u201d Ibid. The Eleventh Circuit also concluded\nthat, \u201ceven if .\u00a0.\u00a0. a constitutional violation of Lane\u2019s\nFirst Amendment rights occurred in these circumstances, Franks\nwould be entitled to qualified immunity in his personal capacity\u201d\nbecause the right at issue had not been clearly established. Id.,\nat 711, n.\u00a02.We granted certiorari,\n571 U.\u00a0S. __ (2014), to resolve discord among the Courts of\nAppeals as to whether public employees may be fired\u2014or suffer other\nadverse employment consequences\u2014for providing truthful subpoenaed\ntestimony outside the course of their ordinary job\nresponsibilities. Compare 523 Fed. Appx., at 712 (case below),\nwith, e.g., Reilly v. Atlantic City, 532 F.\u00a03d 216, 231 (CA3\n2008).IISpeech by citizens on\nmatters of public concern lies at the heart of the First Amendment,\nwhich \u201cwas fashioned to assure unfettered interchange of ideas for\nthe bringing about of political and social changes desired by the\npeople,\u201d Roth v. United States, 354 U.\u00a0S. 476, 484 (1957) .\nThis remains true when speech concerns information related to or\nlearned through public employment. After all, public employees do\nnot renounce their citizenship when they accept employment, and\nthis Court has cautioned time and again that public employers may\nnot condition employment on the relinquishment of constitutional\nrights. See, e.g., Keyishian v. Board of Regents of Univ. of State\nof N. Y., 385 U.\u00a0S. 589, 605 (1967) ; Pickering, 391\nU.\u00a0S., at 568; Connick v. Myers, 461 U.\u00a0S. 138, 142\n(1983) . There is considerable value, moreover, in encouraging,\nrather than inhibiting, speech by public employees. For\n\u201c[g]overnment employees are often in the best position to know what\nails the agencies for which they work.\u201d Waters v. Churchill, 511\nU.\u00a0S. 661, 674 (1994) (plurality opinion). \u201cThe interest at\nstake is as much the public\u2019s interest in receiving informed\nopinion as it is the employee\u2019s own right to disseminate it.\u201d San\nDiego v. Roe, 543 U.\u00a0S. 77, 82 (2004) (per curiam).Our precedents have\nalso acknowledged the government\u2019s countervailing interest in\ncontrolling the operation of its workplaces. See, e.g., Pickering,\n391 U.\u00a0S., at 568. \u201cGovernment employers, like private\nemployers, need a significant degree of control over their\nemployees\u2019 words and actions; without it, there would be little\nchance for the efficient provision of public services.\u201d Garcetti,\n547 U.\u00a0S., at 418.Pickering provides the\nframework for analyzing whether the employee\u2019s interest or the\ngovernment\u2019s interest should prevail in cases where the government\nseeks to curtail the speech of its employees. It requires\n\u201cbalanc[ing] .\u00a0.\u00a0. the interests of the [public\nemployee], as a citizen, in commenting upon matters of public\nconcern and the interest of the State, as an employer, in promoting\nthe efficiency of the public services it performs through its\nemployees.\u201d 391 U.\u00a0S., at 568. In Pickering, the Court held\nthat a teacher\u2019s letter to the editor of a local news-paper\nconcerning a school budget constituted speech on amatter of public\nconcern. Id., at 571. And in balancing the employee\u2019s interest in\nsuch speech against the government\u2019s efficiency interest, the Court\nheld that the publication of the letter did not \u201cimped[e] the\nteacher\u2019s proper performance of his daily duties in the classroom\u201d\nor \u201cinterfer[e] with the regular operation of the schools\ngenerally.\u201d Id., at 572\u2013573. The Court therefore held that the\nteacher\u2019s speech could not serve as the basis for his dismissal.\nId., at 574.In Garcetti, we\ndescribed a two-step inquiry into whether a public employee\u2019s\nspeech is entitled to protection:\u201cThe first requires determining whether\nthe employee spoke as a citizen on a matter of public concern. If\nthe answer is no, the employee has no First Amendment cause of\naction based on his or her employer\u2019s reaction to the speech. If\nthe answer is yes, then the possibility of a First Amendment claim\narises. The question becomes whether the relevant government entity\nhad an adequate justification for treating the employee differently\nfrom any other member of the general public.\u201d 547 U.\u00a0S., at\n418 (citations omitted).In describing the first\nstep in this inquiry, Garcetti distinguished between employee\nspeech and citizen speech. Whereas speech as a citizen may trigger\nprotection, the Court held that \u201cwhen public employees make\nstatements pursuant to their official duties, the employees are not\nspeaking as citizens for First Amendment pur-poses, and the\nConstitution does not insulate their communi-cations from employer\ndiscipline.\u201d Id., at 421. Applying that rule to the facts before\nit, the Court found that an internal memorandum prepared by a\nprosecutor in the course of his ordinary job responsibilities\nconstituted unprotected employee speech. Id., at 424.IIIAgainst this\nbackdrop, we turn to the question pre-sented: whether the First\nAmendment protects a public employee who provides truthful sworn\ntestimony, compelledby subpoena, outside the scope of his ordinary\njob responsibilities.[4] We\nhold that it does.AThe first inquiry is\nwhether the speech in question\u2014Lane\u2019s testimony at Schmitz\u2019\ntrials\u2014is speech as a citizen on a matter of public concern. It\nclearly is.1Truthful testimony\nunder oath by a public employee outside the scope of his ordinary\njob duties is speech as a citizen for First Amendment purposes.\nThat is so even when the testimony relates to his public employment\nor concerns information learned during that employment.In rejecting Lane\u2019s\nargument that his testimony was speech as a citizen, the Eleventh\nCircuit gave short shrift to the nature of sworn judicial\nstatements and ignored the obligation borne by all witnesses\ntestifying under oath. See 523 Fed. Appx., at 712 (finding\nimmaterial the fact that Lane spoke \u201cpursuant to a subpoena and in\nthe litigation context\u201d). Sworn testimony in judicial proceedings\nis a quintessential example of speech as a citizen for a simple\nreason: Anyone who testifies in court bears an obligation, to the\ncourt and society at large, to tell the truth. See, e.g., 18\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71623 (criminalizing false statements under oath\nin judicial proceedings); United States v. Mandujano, 425\nU.\u00a0S. 564, 576 (1976) (plurality opinion) (\u201cPerjured testimony\nis an obvious and flagrant affront to the basic concept of judicial\nproceedings\u201d). When the person testifying is a public employee, he\nmay bear separate obligations to his employer\u2014for example, an\nobligation not to show up to court dressed in an unprofessional\nmanner. But any such obligations as an employee are distinct and\nindependent from the obligation, as a citizen, to speak the truth.\nThat independent obligation renders sworn testimony speech as a\ncitizen and sets it apart from speech made purely in the capacity\nof an employee.In holding that Lane\ndid not speak as a citizen whenhe testified, the Eleventh Circuit\nread Garcetti far too broadly. It reasoned that, because Lane\nlearned of the sub-ject matter of his testimony in the course of\nhis employment with CITY, Garcetti requires that his testimony be\ntreated as the speech of an employee rather than that of a citizen.\nSee 523 Fed. Appx., at 712. It does not.The sworn testimony in\nthis case is far removed from the speech at issue in Garcetti\u2014an\ninternal memorandum prepared by a deputy district attorney for his\nsupervisors recommending dismissal of a particular prosecution. The\nGarcetti Court held that such speech was made pursuant to the\nemployee\u2019s \u201cofficial responsibilities\u201d because \u201c[w]hen [the\nemployee] went to work and performed the tasks he was paid to\nperform, [he] acted as a government employee. The fact that his\nduties sometimes required him to speak or write does not mean that\nhis supervisors were prohib-ited from evaluating his performance.\u201d\n547 U.\u00a0S., at 422, 424.But Garcetti said\nnothing about speech that simply relates to public employment or\nconcerns information learned in the course of public employment.\nThe Garcetti Court made explicit that its holding did not turn on\nthe fact that the memo at issue \u201cconcerned the subject matter of\n[the prosecutor\u2019s] employment,\u201d because \u201c[t]he First Amendment\nprotects some expressions related to the speaker\u2019s job.\u201d Id., at\n421. In other words, the mere fact that a citizen\u2019s speech concerns\ninformation acquired by virtue of his public employment does not\ntransform that speech into employee\u2014rather than citizen\u2014speech. The\ncritical question under Garcetti is whether the speech at issue is\nitself ordinarily within the scope of an employee\u2019s duties, not\nwhether it merely concerns those duties.It bears emphasis that\nour precedents dating back to Pickering have recognized that speech\nby public employees on subject matter related to their employment\nholdsspecial value precisely because those employees gainknowledge\nof matters of public concern through their employment. In\nPickering, for example, the Court observed that \u201c[t]eachers are\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. the members of a commu-nity most likely to have\ninformed and definite opinions as to how funds allotted to the\noperation of the schools should be spent. Accordingly, it is\nessential that they be able to speak out freely on such questions\nwithout fear of retaliatory dismissal.\u201d 391 U.\u00a0S., at 572; see\nalso Garcetti, 547 U.\u00a0S., at 421 (recognizing that \u201c[t]he same\nis true of many other categories of public employees\u201d). Most\nrecently, in San Diego v. Roe, 543 U.\u00a0S., at 80, the Court\nagain observed that public employees \u201care uniquely qualified to\ncomment\u201d on \u201cmatters concerning government policies that are of\ninterest to the public at large.\u201dThe importance of\npublic employee speech is especially evident in the context of this\ncase: a public corruption scandal. The United States, for example,\nrepresents that because \u201c[t]he more than 1000 prosecutions for\nfederal corruption offenses that are brought in a typical year\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. often depend on evidence about activities that\ngovernment officials undertook while in office,\u201d those prosecutions\noften \u201crequire testimony from other government employees.\u201d Brief\nfor United States as Amicus Curiae 20. It would be antithetical to\nour jurisprudence to conclude that the very kind of speech\nnecessary to prosecute corruption by public officials\u2014speech by\npublic employees regarding information learned through their\nemployment\u2014may never form the basis for a First Amendment\nretaliation claim. Such a rule would place public employees who\nwitness corruption in an impossible position, torn between the\nobligation to testify truthfully and the desire to avoid\nretaliation and keep their jobs.Applying these\nprinciples, it is clear that Lane\u2019s sworn testimony is speech as a\ncitizen.2Lane\u2019s testimony is\nalso speech on a matter of public concern. Speech involves matters\nof public concern \u201cwhen it can \u2018be fairly considered as relating to\nany matter of political, social, or other concern to the\ncommunity,\u2019 or when it \u2018is a subject of legitimate news interest;\nthat is, a subject of general interest and of value and concern to\nthe public.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Snyder v. Phelps, 562 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___\n(2011) (slip op., at 6\u20137) (citation omitted). The inquiry turns on\nthe \u201ccontent, form, and context\u201d of the speech. Connick, 461\nU.\u00a0S., at 147\u2013148.The content of Lane\u2019s\ntestimony\u2014corruption in a public program and misuse of state\nfunds\u2014obviously involves a matter of significant public concern.\nSee, e.g., Garcetti, 547 U.\u00a0S., at 425 (\u201cExposing governmental\ninefficiency and misconduct is a matter of considerable\nsignificance\u201d). And the form and context of the speech\u2014sworn\ntestimony in a judicial proceeding\u2014fortify that conclusion. \u201cUnlike\nspeech in other contexts, testimony under oath has the formality\nand gravity necessary to remind the witness that his or her\nstatements will be the basis for official governmental action,\naction that often affects the rights and liberties of others.\u201d\nUnited States v. Alvarez, 567 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op.,\nat 8\u20139) (plurality opinion).*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*We hold, then, that\nLane\u2019s truthful sworn testimony at Schmitz\u2019 criminal trials is\nspeech as a citizen on a matter of public concern.BThis does not settle\nthe matter, however. A public employee\u2019s sworn testimony is not\ncategorically entitled to First Amendment protection simply because\nit is speech as a citizen on a matter of public concern. Under\nPickering, if an employee speaks as a citizen on a matter of public\nconcern, the next question is whether the government had \u201can\nadequate justification for treating the employee differently from\nany other member of the public\u201d based on the government\u2019s needs as\nan employer. Garcetti, 547 U. S., at 418.As discussed\npreviously, we have recognized that government employers often have\nlegitimate \u201cinterest[s] in the effective and efficient fulfillment\nof [their] responsibilities to the public,\u201d including\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018promot[ing] efficiency and integrity in the discharge of\nofficial duties,\u2019\u00a0\u201d and \u201c\u00a0\u2018maintain[ing] proper\ndiscipline in public service.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Connick, 461 U.\u00a0S., at\n150\u2013151. We have also cautioned, however, that \u201ca stronger showing\n[of government interests] may be necessary if the employee\u2019s speech\nmore substantially involve[s] matters of public concern.\u201d Id., at\n152.Here, the employer\u2019s\nside of the Pickering scale is entirely empty: Respondents do not\nassert, and cannot demonstrate, any government interest that tips\nthe balance in their favor. There is no evidence, for example, that\nLane\u2019s testimony at Schmitz\u2019 trials was false or erroneous or that\nLane unnecessarily disclosed any sensitive, confidential, or\nprivileged information while testifying.[5] In these circumstances, we conclude that Lane\u2019s\nspeech is entitled to protection under the First Amendment. The\nEleventh Circuit erred in holding otherwise and dismissing Lane\u2019s\nclaim of retaliation on that basis.IVRespondent Franks\nargues that even if Lane\u2019s testimony is protected under the First\nAmendment, the claims against him in his individual capacity should\nbe dismissed on the basis of qualified immunity. We agree.Qualified immunity\n\u201cgives government officials breathing room to make reasonable but\nmistaken judgments about open legal questions.\u201d Ashcroft v.\nal-Kidd, 563 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 12). Under\nthis doctrine, courts may not award damages against a government\nofficial in his personal capacity unless \u201cthe official violated a\nstatutory or constitutional right,\u201d and \u201cthe right was \u2018clearly\nestablished\u2019 at the time of the challenged conduct.\u201d Id., at ___\n(slip op., at 3).The relevant question\nfor qualified immunity purposes is this: Could Franks reasonably\nhave believed, at the time he fired Lane, that a government\nemployer could fire an employee on account of testimony the\nemployee gave, under oath and outside the scope of his ordinary job\nresponsibilities? Eleventh Circuit precedent did not preclude\nFranks from reasonably holding that belief. And no decision of this\nCourt was sufficiently clear to cast doubt on the controlling\nEleventh Circuit precedent.In dismissing Lane\u2019s\nclaim, the Eleventh Circuit relied on its 1998 decision in Morris\nv. Crow, 142 F.\u00a03d 1379 (per curiam). There, a deputy sheriff\nsued the sheriff and two other officials, alleging that he had been\nfired in retaliation for statements he made in an accident report\nand later giving deposition testimony about his investigation of a\nfatal car crash between another officer and a citizen. Id., at\n1381. In his accident report, the plaintiff noted that the officer\nwas driving more than 130 mph in a 50 mph zone, without using his\nemergency blue warning light. See ibid. The plaintiff later\ntestified to these facts at a deposition in a wrongful death suit\nagainst the sheriff\u2019s office. Ibid. His superiors later fired him.\nIbid.The Eleventh Circuit,\nin a pre-Garcetti decision, concluded that the plaintiff\u2019s\ndeposition testimony was unprotected. It held that a public\nemployee\u2019s speech is protected only when it is \u201c\u00a0\u2018made\nprimarily in the employee\u2019s role as citizen,\u2019\u00a0\u201d rather than\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018primarily in the role of employee.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Morris, 142\nF.\u00a03d, at 1382. And it found the plaintiff\u2019s deposition\ntestimony to be speech as an em-ployee because it \u201creiterated the\nconclusions regardinghis observations of the accident\u201d that he\n\u201cgenerated in thenormal course of [his] duties.\u201d Ibid. Critically,\nthe court acknowledged\u2014and was unmoved by\u2014the fact that al-though\nthe plaintiff had investigated the accident andprepared the report\npursuant to his official duties, there was no \u201cevidence that [he]\ngave deposition testimony for any reason other than in compliance\nwith a subpoena to testify truthfully in the civil suit regarding\nthe .\u00a0.\u00a0. accident.\u201d Ibid. The court further reasoned\nthat the speech could not \u201cbe characterized as an attempt to make\npublic comment on sheriff\u2019s office policies and procedures, the\ninternal workings of the department, the quality of its employees\nor upon any issue at all.\u201d Ibid.Lane argues that two\nother Eleventh Circuit precedents put Franks on notice that his\nconduct violated the First Amendment: Martinez v. Opa-Locka, 971\nF.\u00a02d 708 (1992) (per curiam), and Tindal v. Montgomery Cty.\nComm\u2019n, 32 F.\u00a03d 1535 (1994). Martinez involved a public\nemployee\u2019s subpoenaed testimony before the Opa-Locka City\nCommission regarding her employer\u2019s procurement practices. 971\nF.\u00a02d, at 710. The Eleventh Circuit held that her speech was\nprotected, reasoning that it addressed a matter of public concern\nand that her interest in speaking freely was not outweighed by her\nemployer\u2019s interest in providing government services. Id., at 712.\nIt held, further, that the relevant constitutional rules were so\nclearly established at the time that qualified immunity did not\napply. Id., at 713. Tindal, decided two years after Martinez,\ninvolved a public employee\u2019s subpoenaed testimony in her\nco-worker\u2019s sexual harassment lawsuit. 32 F.\u00a03d, at 1537\u20131538.\nThe court again ruled in favor of the em-ployee. It held that the\nemployee\u2019s speech touched upona public concern and that her\nemployer had not offered any evidence that the speech hindered\noperations. Id., at 1539\u20131540.Morris, Martinez, and\nTindal represent the landscape of Eleventh Circuit precedent the\nparties rely on for qualified immunity purposes. If Martinez and\nTindal were controlling in the Eleventh Circuit in 2009, we would\nagree with Lane that Franks could not reasonably have believed that\nit was lawful to fire Lane in retaliation for his testimony. But\nboth cases must be read together with Morris, which reasoned\u2014in\ndeclining to afford First Amendment protection\u2014that the plaintiff\u2019s\ndecision to testify was motivated solely by his desire to comply\nwith a subpoena. The same could be said of Lane\u2019s decision to\ntestify. Franks was thus entitled to rely on Morris when he fired\nLane.[6]Lane argues that Morris\nis inapplicable because it distinguished Martinez, suggesting that\nMartinez survived Morris. See Morris, 142 F.\u00a03d, at 1382\u20131383.\nBut this debate over whether Martinez or Morris applies to Lane\u2019s\nclaim only highlights the dispositive point: At the time of Lane\u2019s\ntermination, Eleventh Circuit precedent did not provide clear\nnotice that subpoenaed testimony concerning information acquired\nthrough public employment is speech of a citizen entitled to First\nAmendment protection. At best, Lane can demonstrate only a\ndiscrepancy in Eleventh Circuit precedent, which is insufficient to\ndefeat the defense of qualified immunity.Finally, Lane argues\nthat decisions of the Third and Seventh Circuits put Franks on\nnotice that his firing of Lane was unconstitutional. See Reilly,\n532 F.\u00a03d, at 231 (CA3) (truthful testimony in court is\ncitizen speech protected by the First Amendment); Morales v. Jones,\n494 F.\u00a03d 590, 598 (CA7 2007) (similar). But, as the court\nbelow acknowledged, those precedents were in direct conflict with\nEleventh Circuit precedent. See 523 Fed. Appx., at 712,\nn.\u00a03.There is no doubt that\nthe Eleventh Circuit incorrectly concluded that Lane\u2019s testimony\nwas not entitled to First Amendment protection. But because the\nquestion was not \u201cbeyond debate\u201d at the time Franks acted, al-Kidd,\n563 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 9), Franks is entitled to\nqualified immunity.VLane\u2019s speech is\nentitled to First Amendment protection, but because respondent\nFranks is entitled to qualified immunity, we affirm the judgment of\nthe Eleventh Circuit as to the claims against Franks in his\nindividual capacity. Our decision does not resolve, however, the\nclaims against Burrow\u2014initially brought against Franks when he\nserved as President of CACC\u2014in her official capacity. Although the\nDistrict Court dismissed those claims for prospective relief as\nbarred by the Eleventh Amendment, the Eleventh Circuit declined to\nconsider that question on appeal, see 523 Fed. Appx., at 711\n(\u201cBecause Lane has failed to establish a prima facie case of\nretaliation, we do not decide about Franks\u2019 defense of sovereign\nimmunity\u201d), and the parties have not asked us to consider it now.\nWe therefore reverse the judgment of the Eleventh Circuit as to\nthose claims and remand for further proceedings.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*For the foregoing\nreasons, the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the\nEleventh Circuit is affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the\ncase is remandedfor further proceedings consistent with this\nopinion.It is so ordered.Notes1See, Lawmaker Faces Fraud\nCharge in June, Montgomery Advertiser, May 6, 2008, p. 1B; Johnson,\nState Lawmaker\u2019s Fraud Trial Starts Today, Montgomery Advertiser,\nAug. 18, 2008, p. 1B; Faulk, Schmitz Testifies in Her Defense: Says\nState Job was Legitimate, Birmingham News, Feb. 20, 2009, p. 1A;\nFaulk, Schmitz Convicted, Loses her State Seat, Birmingham News,\nFeb. 25, 2009, p. 1A.2Lane also brought claims\nagainst CACC, as well as claims under a state whistleblower\nstatute, Ala. Code \u00a736\u201326A\u20133 (2013), and . Those claims are not at\nissue here.3Because Burrow replaced\nFranks as President of CACC during the pendency of this lawsuit,\nthe claims originally filed against Franks in his official capacity\nare now against Burrow.4It is undisputed that\nLane\u2019s ordinary job responsibilities did not include testifying in\ncourt proceedings. See v. , 523 Fed. Appx. 709, 712 (CA11 2013).\nFor that reason, Lane asked the Court to decide only whether\ntruthful sworn testimony that is not a part of an employee\u2019s\nordinary job responsibilities is citizen speech on a matter of\npublic concern. Pet. for Cert. i. We accordingly need not address\nin this case whether truthful sworn testimony would constitute\ncitizen speech under when given as part of a public employee\u2019s\nordinary job duties, and express no opinion on the matter\ntoday.5Of course, quite apart\nfrom balancing, wrongdoing that an employee admits to while\ntestifying may be a valid basis for termination or other\ndiscipline.6There is another reason\nundermines and . In and , the Eleventh Circuit asked only whether\nthe speech at issue addressed a matter of public concern. , which\nappeared to anticipate , asked both whether the speech at issue was\nspeech of an employee (and not a citizen) and whether it touched\nupon a matter of public concern.
