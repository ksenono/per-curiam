    "text": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES_________________No. 13\u20131428_________________RON DAVIS, ACTING WARDEN, PETITIONERv.HECTOR AYALAon writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the ninth circuit[June 18, 2015]Justice Sotomayor, with whom Justice Ginsburg,\nJustice Breyer, and Justice Kagan join, dissenting.At Hector Ayala\u2019s trial, the prosecution\nexercised its peremptory strikes to dismiss all seven of the\npotential black and Hispanic jurors. In his federal habeas\npetition, Ayala challenged the state trial court\u2019s failure to\npermit his attorneys to participate in hearings regarding the\nlegitimacy of the prosecution\u2019s alleged race-neutral reasons for\nits strikes. SeeBatsonv.Kentucky, 476 U.\u00a0S.\n79 \u201398 (1986). The Court assumes that defense counsel\u2019s exclusion\nfrom these proceedings violated Ayala\u2019s constitutional rights, but\nconcludes that the Ninth Circuit erred in granting habeas relief\nbecause there is insufficient reason to believe that counsel could\nhave convinced the trial court to reject the prosecution\u2019s\nproffered reasons. I respectfully dissent. Given the strength of\nAyala\u2019s prima facie case and the comparative juror analysis his\nattorneys could have developed if given the opportunity to do so,\nlittle doubt exists that counsel\u2019s exclusion from Ayala\u2019sBatsonhearings substantially influenced the outcome.IMy disagreement with the Court does not stem\nfrom its discussion of the applicable standard of review, which\nsimply restates the holding ofFryv.Pliler, 551\nU.\u00a0S. 112 (2007).Fryrejected the argument that the\nAntiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, 28\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72254, compels federal courts to apply any\nstandard other than that set forth inBrechtv.Abrahamson, 507 U.\u00a0S. 619 (1993) , when assessing the\nharmlessness of a constitutional error on habeas review. 551\nU.\u00a0S., at 120.Brecht, in turn, held that the\nharmlessness standard federal courts must apply in collateral\nproceedings is more difficult to meet than the \u201c\u00a0\u2018beyond a\nreasonable doubt\u2019\u00a0\u201d standard applicable on direct review. 507\nU.\u00a0S., at 622\u2013623 (quotingChapmanv.California, 386 U.\u00a0S. 18, 24 (1967) ). More\nspecifically, underBrecht, a federal court can grant habeas\nrelief only when it concludes that a constitutional error had a\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018substantial and injurious effect or influence\u2019\u00a0\u201d on\neither a jury verdict or a trial court decision. 507 U.\u00a0S., at\n623.Later,O\u2019Nealv.McAninch, 513 U.\u00a0S.\n432 (1995) , clarified that this standard is satisfied when a\nreviewing judge \u201cis in grave doubt about whether\u201d the error is\nharmless; that is, when \u201cthe matter is so evenly balanced that [a\njudge] feels himself in virtual equipoise as to the harmlessness of\nthe error.\u201dId.,at 435 (emphasis deleted). See alsoante,at 10 (quotingO\u2019Neal, 513 U.\u00a0S., at 436).\nPut differently, when a federal court is in equipoise as to whether\nan error was actually prejudicial, it must \u201ctreat the error, not as\nif it were harmless, but as if it affected the verdict\n(i.e.,as if it had a \u2018substantial and injurious effect or\ninfluence in determining the jury\u2019s verdict\u2019).\u201dO\u2019Neal, 513\nU.\u00a0S., at 435.In addition to confirming theBrechtstandard\u2019s continued vitality,Fryestablished its\nexclusivity.Fryexpressly held that federal habeas courts\nneed not first assess whether a state court unreasonably appliedChapmanbefore deciding whether that error was prejudicial\nunderBrecht.Such a requirement would \u201cmak[e] no sense\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. when the latter [standard] obviously subsumes the\nformer.\u201dFry, 551 U.\u00a0S., at 120.Nothing in the\nCourt\u2019s opinion today calls into question this aspect ofFry\u2019s holding. If a trial error is prejudicial underBrecht\u2019s standard, a state court\u2019s determination that the\nerror was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt is necessarily\nunreasonable. Seeante,at 11\u201312.IIATo applyBrechtto the facts of this\ncase, it is essential to understand the contours of Ayala\u2019s\nunderlying constitutional claim or\u2014perhaps more importantly\u2014to\nappreciate what his claim is not. Trial judges assess criminal\ndefendants\u2019 challenges to prosecutors\u2019 use of peremptory strikes\nusing the three-part procedure first announced inBatson.\nAfter a defendant makes a \u201cprima facie showing that a peremptory\nchallenge [was] .\u00a0.\u00a0. exercised on the basis of race,\u201d\nthe prosecution is given an opportunity to \u201coffer a race-neutral\nbasis for striking the juror in question,\u201dMiller-Elv.Cockrell, 537 U.\u00a0S. 322, 328 (2003) . The court then\n\u201cdecid[es] whether it was more likely than not that the challenge\nwas improperly motivated.\u201dJohnsonv.California, 545\nU.\u00a0S. 162, 169, 170 (2005) . This determination is a factual\none, which\u2014as the Court correctly notes\u2014reviewing courts must\naccord \u201c\u00a0\u2018great deference.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Seeante,at 13\n(quotingFelknerv.Jackson, 562 U.\u00a0S. 594, 598\n(2011) (per curiam)).Here, Ayala does not claim that the trial court\nwrongly rejected hisBatsonchallenges based on the record\nbefore it. Rather, Ayala\u2019s claim centers on the exclusion of his\nattorneys from theBatsonhearings. Ayala contends that\nthere is at least a grave doubt as to whether the trial or\nappellate court\u2019s consideration of hisBatsonchallenges was\nsubstantially influenced by the trial court\u2019s erroneous refusal to\npermit his attorneys to appear at the hearings at which those\nchallenges were adjudicated. Ayala\u2019s conviction must be vacated if\nthere is grave doubt as to whether even just one of hisBatsonchallenges would have been sustained had the defense\nbeen present.Snyderv.Louisiana, 552 U.\u00a0S.\n472, 478 (2008) (reversing a conviction after concluding that use\nof one peremptory strike was racially motivated).BThe Court\u2019sBrechtapplication begins\nand ends with a discussion of particular arguments the Ninth\nCircuit posited Ayala\u2019s lawyers could have raised had they been\npresent at hisBatsonhearings. This approach fails to\naccount for the basic background principle that must inform the\napplication ofBrechtto Ayala\u2019s proceduralBatsonclaim: the \u201c[c]ommon sense\u201d insight \u201cthat secret decisions based on\nonly one side of the story will prove inaccurate more often than\nthose made after hearing from both sides.\u201dKaleyv.United States, 571 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2014) (Roberts,\nC.\u00a0J., dissenting) (slip op., at 16). Our entire criminal\njustice system was founded on the premise that \u201c[t]ruth\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. is best discovered by powerful statements on both\nsides of the question.\u201dUnited Statesv.Cronic, 466\nU.\u00a0S. 648, 655 (1984) (internal quotation marks omitted).\nThere is no reason to believe thatBatsonhearings are the\nrare exception to this rule. Instead, defense counsel could have\nplayed at least two critical roles had they been present at Ayala\u2019sBatsonhearings.First, Ayala\u2019s attorneys would have been able to\ncall into question the credibility of the prosecution\u2019s asserted\nrace-neutral justifications for the use of its peremptory strikes.\nOf course, a trial court may identify some pretextual reasons on\nits own, butSnyderheld that when assessing a claimedBatsonerror, \u201call of the circumstances that bear upon the\nissue of racial animosity must be consulted.\u201dSnyder, 552\nU.\u00a0S., at 478. Absent an adversarial presentation, a diligent\njudge may overlook relevant facts or legal arguments in even a\nstraightforward case. There is also great probative force to a\n\u201ccomparative juror analysis\u201d\u2014an analysis of whether the\nprosecution\u2019s reasons for using its peremptory strikes against\nnonwhite jurors apply equally to white jurors whom it would have\nallowed to serve.Miller-Elv.Dretke, 545 U.\u00a0S.\n231, 241 (2005) . See alsoSnyder, 552 U.\u00a0S., at 483\n(emphasizing importance of conducting a comparative juror analysis\nin the trial court). Trial courts are ill suited to perform this\nintensive inquiry without defense counsel\u2019s assistance.The risk that important arguments will not be\nconsidered rises close to a certainty in a capital case like\nAyala\u2019s, where jury selection spanned more than three months,\ninvolved more than 200 prospective jurors, and generated a record\nthat is massive by any standard. SeeAyalav.Wong,\n756 F.\u00a03d 656, 660, 676 (CA9 2014) (case below). It strains\ncredulity to suggest that a court confronted with this mountain of\ninformation necessarily considered all of the facts that would have\ninformed its credibility determination without the presence of\ndefense counsel to help bring them to its attention.Second, not only did the exclusion of defense\ncounsel from Ayala\u2019sBatsonhearings prevent him from making\nhis strongest arguments before the person best situated to assess\ntheir merit, it also impeded his ability to raise these claims on\nappeal. Because Ayala\u2019s lawyers were not afforded any opportunity\nto respond to the prosecution\u2019s race-neutral reasons, we are left\nto speculate as to whether the trial court actually considered any\nof the points the defense would have made before it accepted the\nprosecution\u2019s proffered explanations. Moreover, even if we could\ndivine which of the possible considerations the trial judge took\ninto account, our review would still be unduly constrained by a\nrecord that lacks whatever material facts the defense would have\npreserved had it been on notice of the assertions that it needed to\nchallenge. Perhaps some of these facts, such as the jurors\u2019\nappearance and demeanor, were known to the trial judge, but\nappellate courts \u201ccan only serve [their] function when the record\nis clear as to the relevant facts\u201d or when they can rely on\n\u201cdefense counsel[\u2019s] fail[ure] to point out any such facts after\nlearning of the prosecutor\u2019s reasons.\u201dUnited Statesv.Thompson, 827 F.\u00a02d 1254, 1261 (CA9 1987). Neither of\nthese conditions is met here.For the reasons described above, the fact that\ncounsel was wrongfully excluded from Ayala\u2019sBatsonhearings\non its own raises doubt as to whether the outcome of these\nproceedings\u2014or the appellate courts\u2019 review of them\u2014would have been\nthe same had counsel been present.[1] This doubt is exacerbated by the loss of the vast\nmajority of the questionnaires that jurors completed at the start\nofvoir\u00a0dire, including those filled out by the seven\nblack and Hispanic jurors against whom the prosecution exercised\nits peremptory strikes. The prosecution cited these questionnaires\nin support of its alleged race-neutral reasons at theex\u00a0parteBatsonhearings. Seee.g.,App.\n283, 298, 312, 314, 316. Without the underlying documents, however,\nit is impossible to assess whether the prosecution\u2019s\ncharacterizations of those prospective jurors\u2019 responses were fair\nand accurate. The loss of the questionnaires has also precluded\nevery court that has reviewed this case from performing a\ncomprehensive comparative juror analysis. The Court today analyzes\nhow the prosecution\u2019s statements at theex\u00a0parteBatsonhearings regarding the black and Hispanic jurors\u2019\nquestionnaires stack up against the actual questionnaires completed\nby the white seated jurors and alternates. But there is no way to\ndiscern how these representations compare with the answers that\nwere given by white jurors whom the prosecution would have\npermitted to serve but whom the defense ultimately struck. SeeMiller-Elv.Dretke, 545 U.\u00a0S., at 244\u2013245\n(comparing a juror struck by the prosecution with a juror\nchallenged only by the defense).CThe above-described consequences of the trial\ncourt\u2019s procedural error and the fact that the prosecution struck\nevery potential black or Hispanic juror go a long way toward\nestablishing the degree of uncertainty thatBrechtrequires.\nKeeping these considerations in mind, the next step is to assess\nthe arguments that Ayala\u2019s attorneys may have raised had they been\nallowed to participate at hisBatsonhearings. As explained\nabove, Ayala is entitled to habeas relief if a reviewing judge is\nin \u201cequipoise\u201d as to whether his lawyers\u2019 exclusion from theBatsonhearings had an \u201cinjurious effect\u201d on the trial\ncourt\u2019s failure to find by a preponderance of the evidence that any\nof the prosecution\u2019s peremptory strikes was racially motivated.\nWith the inquiry so framed, it is easy to see that the Ninth\nCircuit correctly found that Ayala was actually prejudiced by the\ntrial court\u2019s constitutional error. In particular, there is a\nsubstantial likelihood that if defense counsel had been present,\nAyala could at least have convinced the trial court that the\nrace-neutral reasons the prosecution put forward for dismissing a\nblack juror, Olanders D., were pretextual.[2]The prosecution offered three justifications for\nstriking Olanders D.: (1) he might be unable to vote for the death\npenalty because he had written in his questionnaire that \u201che does\nnot believe [in] it\u201d and had failed to fully explain a subsequent\nchange in position; (2) his questionnaire answers were poor; and,\n(3) he might lack the \u201cability to fit in with a cohesive group of\n12 people.\u201d App. 283. The trial court rejected the third of these\nreasons outright, noting that \u201cit may well .\u00a0.\u00a0. be that\nhe would get along very well with 12 people.\u201dId.,at\n283\u2013284.I have grave misgivings as to whether the trial\njudge would have found it more likely than not that the first two\npurported bases were legitimate had defense counsel been given an\nopportunity to respond to them.Ayala\u2019s attorneys could have challenged the\nprosecution\u2019s claim that Olanders D. would hesitate to impose the\ndeath penalty by pointing to a seated juror\u2014Ana L.\u2014who made\nremarkably similar statements concerning capital punishment. Based\non his remarks duringvoir\u00a0dire, it appears that\nOlanders D. suggested on his questionnaire that he was or had been\nopposed to the death penalty.[3]Id.,at 176, 179. Ana L.\u2019s questionnaire\ncontained numerous comparable statements. When asked to express her\n\u201cfeelings about the death penalty,\u201d she wrote: \u201cI don\u2019t believe in\ntaking a life.\u201dId.,at 108. And, in response to a question\nregarding whether she \u201cwould like to serve as a juror and why?\u201d,\nAna L. said: \u201cno\u2014If I am selected as a Juror and all Jurors voted\nfor the death penalty I probably would not be able to vote for the\ndeath penalty.\u201dId.,at 109. Finally, on her questionnaire,\nAna L. indicated that she believes the death penalty is imposed\n\u201c[t]oo often\u201d and that she strongly disagrees with the \u201cadage, \u2018An\neye for any eye,\u2019\u00a0\u201d which she understood to mean,\u201c[a] criminal\ntook a life[,] now [it] is our turn to take his.\u201dId.,at\n108\u2013109.A direct comparison of Olanders D.\u2019s and Ana\nL.\u2019svoir\u00a0direanswers is equally telling. Duringvoir\u00a0dire, Olanders D. clarified that he had not\nintended his questionnaire to reflect that he was categorically\nopposed to the death penalty, but only that his views on the topic\nhad evolved over the prior decade and that he had come to believe\nthat the death penalty \u201cwould be an appropriate sentence under\ncertain circumstances.\u201dId.,at 176. To account for this\nchange in his position, Olanders D. cited a number of\nconsiderations, including a new understanding of what his religion\nrequired,ibid.,\u201cmore familiar[ity] with the laws,\u201did.,at 178, increased violence in our soci-ety,ibid.,and conversations with his immediate family,id.,at 180. Ana L., by contrast, stated atvoir\u00a0direthat she \u201cstrongly .\u00a0.\u00a0. did not\nbelieve in the death penalty\u201d up until she \u201c[f]illed out the\nquestionnaire.\u201dId.,at 193. And, only after repeated\nattempts by both the defense and the prosecution to get her to\npinpoint what caused this sudden about face, Ana L. said that she\nhad \u201clisten[ed] to the Bundy evidence that was said and his being\nput to death, and I started to think; and I said if they were\nguilty maybe there is a death sentence for these people.\u201dId.,at 202.[4]Based on this record, it requires little\nspeculation to see that defense counsel could have made a powerful\nargument that Ana L. was equally or even less likely to impose the\ndeath penalty than Olanders D. While both jurors had opposed the\ndeath penalty at some point in the past, Olanders D. stated that he\nhad come to believe in capital punishment after a period of\nsustained deliberation. Ana L., however, purported to change her\nview due only to one recent execution and the fact that she had\nbeen called to serve as a juror on a capital case. Moreover, there\nis no basis to think that the trial court accounted for the\nsimilarities between Ana L. and Olanders D. Approximately two\nmonths passed between Olanders D.\u2019s and Ana L.\u2019svoir\u00a0direhearings and the date on which the\nprosecution exercised its peremptory strike against Olanders D.\nWithout the benefit of defense counsel to help jog his\nrecollection, it is absurd to proceed as if the trial judge\nactually considered one of more than 200 prospective jurors\u2019\nstatements concerning the death penalty when ruling on Ayala\u2019sBatsonmotion. Taken together, it seems highly likely that\nthese arguments\u2014had they been raised\u2014would have convinced the trial\njudge that the prosecution\u2019s first alleged reason for striking\nOlanders D. was pretextual.As for the prosecution\u2019s second purported\njustification\u2014that his questionnaire responses \u201cwere poor,\u201did.,at 283\u2014it is impossible to know what winning arguments\nthe defense could have raised because the questionnaire itself is\nmissing from the record.[5]\nIndeed, for all that is known, counsel may have had a compelling\nargument that Olanders D.\u2019s answers were cogent and complete. Even\nif some of them were lacking, however, counsel could still have\ndrawn the trial judge\u2019s attention to weak questionnaires completed\nby several of the seated jurors. For instance, if the prosecution\u2019s\nclaim was that Olanders D.\u2019s questionnaire answers were conclusory,\nAyala\u2019s counsel could have referred the Court to seated juror\nCharles G.\u2019s questionnaire. In response to a prompt asking\nprospective jurors to explain why they would or would not like to\nbe empaneled in Ayala\u2019s case, Charles G. wrote only \u201cNo.\u201dId.,at 71. Alternatively, if the prosecution\u2019s concern was\nthat Olanders D.\u2019s answer to a particular question demonstrated an\ninability to clearly express himself, the defense could have\ndirected the court\u2019s attention to the questionnaire completed by\nseated juror Thomas B. When asked to share his \u201cimpressions or\nfeelings .\u00a0.\u00a0. about gangs based on what [he had] read or\ns[een],\u201d Thomas B. stated: \u201cI feel the only media coverage they get\nis bad, however, those whom do constructive events usually seek out\npositive media coverage.\u201dId.,at 30. Finally, it bears\nnoting that if Ayala\u2019s lawyers had been able to respond at theBatsonhearing, they would have had the questionnaires of\nmany more comparable jurors at their disposal. It is entirely\npossible that some of the questionnaires completed by prospective\njurors who were accepted by the prosecution but dismissed by the\ndefense were weaker than those completed by Charles G. and Thomas\nB.In short, it is probable that had Ayala\u2019s\nlawyers been present at theBatsonhearing on Olanders D.,\nhis strongBatsonclaim would have turned out to be a\nwinning one. The trial judge rejected one of the reasons advanced\nby the prosecution on its own and the defense had numerous\npersuasive arguments that it could have leveled against the\nremaining two justifications had it been given the opportunity to\ndo so.IIIThe Court concludes that Ayala is not entitled\nto habeas relief because it finds that there is little or no reason\nto doubt that the trial judge would have accepted both of the\nabove-discussed reasons for striking Olanders D. even if counsel\nparticipated at Ayala\u2019sBatsonhearings. The Court\u2019s\nanalysis, however, misunderstands the record and mistakes Ayala\u2019s\nproceduralBatsonclaim for a direct challenge to a trial\ncourt\u2019s denial of aBatsonmotion.In defense of the prosecution\u2019s first basis for\nstriking Olanders D.\u2014that he was uncomfortable with the death\npenalty\u2014the Court begins by asserting that Ana L. was\ninsufficiently similar to Olanders D. to have cast any doubt on the\nprosecution\u2019s position. Olanders D., the Court maintains,\n\u201cinitially voiced unequivocal opposition to the death penalty,\u201d\nwhereas Ana L. \u201cwrote on [her] questionnaire that she\n\u2018probablywould not be able to vote for the death\npenalty.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAnte,at 15\u201316 (emphasis in original). But\nthe Court has plucked one arguably ambiguous statement from Ana\nL.\u2019s questionnaire while ignoring others (described above)\nsuggesting that she fundamen-tally opposed capital punishment. More\nimportantly, the Court is not comparing apples with apples. Because\nOlanders D.\u2019s questionnaire has been lost, there is no way to know\nthe extent to which the views he expressed there were\n\u201cunequivocal.\u201d Consequently, in support of its contention that\nOlanders D. originally wrote that he was categorically opposed to\nthe death penalty, the Court relies on his response to a question\nposed by the prosecution duringvoir\u00a0dire. To be sure,\nwhen asked whether he had stated that he did not \u201cbelieve in the\ndeath penalty\u201d on his questionnaire, Olanders D. responded: \u201cThat\u2019s\ncorrect.\u201d App. 179. Duringvoir\u00a0dire, however, Ana L.\ndescribed the position she had taken in her questionnaire in\nidentical terms, stating: \u201cI remember saying [on my questionnaire]\nthat I didn\u2019t believe in the death penalty.\u201dId.,at\n201.Given the difficulty of differentiating between\nAna L.\u2019s and Olanders D.\u2019s views toward the death penalty based on\nthe record before us, the Court understandably does not press this\nfactual point further. Instead, it commits a legal error by\ncontending that the trial court\u2019s determination is entitled to\ndeference because the judge\u2014unlike this Court\u2014had the benefit of\nobserving both Olanders D.\u2019s and the prosecution\u2019s demeanor.Ante,at 16. Deference may be warranted when reviewing a\nsubstantiveBatsonclaim. By suggesting that a trial judge\ncan make a sound credibility determination without the benefit of\nan adversarial proceeding, however, the Court ignores the\nprocedural nature of the constitutional error whose existence it\npurports to assume. Courts defer to credibility findings not only\nbecause of trial judges\u2019 proximity to courtroom events, but also\nbecause of the expectations regarding the procedures used in the\nproceedings that they oversee. A decision to credit a prosecution\u2019s\nrace-neutral basis for striking a juror is entitled to great weight\nif that reason has \u201csurvive[d] the crucible of meaningful\nadversarial testing.\u201dCronic, 466 U.\u00a0S., at 656. It\nwarrants substantially less\u2014if any\u2014deference where, as here, it is\nmade in the absence of the \u201cfundamental instrument for judicial\njudgment: an adversary proceeding in which both parties may\nparticipate.\u201dCarrollv.President and Comm\u2019rs of\nPrincess Anne, 393 U.\u00a0S. 175, 183 (1968) ; see alsoKaley, 571 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (Roberts, C.\u00a0J.,\ndissenting) (slip op.,at 16) (\u201cIt takes little imagination to see\nthat .\u00a0.\u00a0.ex\u00a0parteproceedings create a\nheightened risk of error\u201d).[6]The Court\u2019s analysis of the second reason put\nforward for striking Olanders D.\u2014that his questionnaire was faulty\u2014\nfares no better. As a preliminary matter, perhaps because Olanders\nD.\u2019s questionnaire has been lost, the Court characterizes the\nprosecution\u2019s second proffered reason for dismissing Olanders D. as\nan objection toallof his \u201cresponses\u201d as opposed to simply\nthe responses on hisquestionnaire.Ante, at 14. But\neven if the prosecution had relied on the rationale that the Court\nnow substitutes, there is a real likelihood that the defense would\nstill have been able to undermine its credibility.The Court asserts that Olanders D.\u2019s \u201cresponses\u201d\nwere misleading because he had \u201cunequivocally\u201d stated that he did\nnot believe in the death penalty on his questionnaire, but atvoir\u00a0direhe said that his views on capital punishment\nhad changed over the previous 10 years.Ante,at 18. The\nCourt\u2019s argument thus hinges on the premise that Olanders D.\u2019s\nquestionnaire clearly stated that he was opposed to the death\npenalty. At least one person, how-ever, did not construe Olander\nD.\u2019s questionnaire to express such a categorical view: defense\ncounsel. Duringvoir\u00a0dire, one of Ayala\u2019s lawyers\nremarked that she thought Olanders D.\u2019s questionnaire \u201cindicated\nthat [he] had had some change in [his] feelings about the death\npenalty.\u201d App. 176. \u201c[M]y understanding,\u201d she said, \u201cis that at one\ntime [he] felt one way, and\u2014and then at some point [he] felt\ndifferently.\u201dIbid.Thus, if (as the Court now hypothesizes)\nthe trial court was inclined to accept the prosecution\u2019s second\nreason for striking Olanders D. based on apparent tension between\nhis questionnaire and his statements duringvoir\u00a0dire(a proposition that is itself uncertain), the defense may have been\nable to argue persuasively that any claimed inconsistency was\nillusory.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*Batsonrecognized that it is\nfundamentally unfair to permit racial considerations to drive the\nuse of peremptory challenges against jurors. When the prosecution\nstrikes every potential black and Hispanic juror, a reviewing court\nhas a responsibility to ensure that the trial court\u2019s denial of the\ndefendant\u2019sBatsonmotion was not influenced by\nconstitutional error. But there is neither a factual nor a legal\nbasis for the Court\u2019s confidence that the prosecution\u2019s\nrace-neutral reasons for striking Olanders D. were unassailable.\nBecause the Court overlooks that Ayala raised a proceduralBatsonclaim, it scours the record for possible support for\nthe trial court\u2019s credibility determination without accounting for\nthe flaws in the process that led to it. The proper inquiry is not\nwhether the trial court\u2019s determination can be sustained, but\nwhether it may have been different had counsel been present. Given\nthe strength of Ayala\u2019s prima facie case and the arguments his\ncounsel would have been able to make based even on the limited\nexisting record, grave doubts exist as to whether counsel\u2019s\nexclusion from Ayala\u2019sBatsonhearings was harmless.\nAccordingly, I respectfully dissent.Notes1Indeed, in a future case\narising in a direct review posture, the Court may have occasion to\nconsider whether the error that the Court assumes here gives rise\nto \u201ccircumstances that are so likely to prejudice the accused that\nthe cost of litigating their effect in a particular case is\nunjustified.\u201dUnited Statesv.Cronic, 466 U.\u00a0S.\n648, 658 (1984) . See alsoMickensv.Taylor, 535\nU.\u00a0S. 162, 166 (2002) (noting that we have \u201cpresumed\n[prejudicial] effec[t] where assistance of counsel has been denied\nentirely or during a critical stage of the\nproceeding\u201d).2Because Ayala was\nactually prejudiced by his counsel\u2019s exclusion from theBatsonhearing on Olanders D., there is no need to address\nhis claims concerning the other black and Hispanic jurors. That\nsaid, Ayala\u2019s attorneys may have had strong arguments with respect\nto those jurors too. Moreover, Ayala\u2019sBatsonchallenge to\nOlanders D. would have been even stronger had counsel been given\nthe opportunity to demonstrate that some of the reasons given for\nstriking the other black and Hispanic jurors were pretextual. SeeSnyderv.Louisiana, 552 U.\u00a0S. 472, 478 (2008)\n(observing that courts should \u201cconsider the strike of [one juror]\nfor the bearing it might have upon the strike of [a second\njuror]\u201d).3It is, of course,\nimpossible to verify what Olanders D. said in his questionnaire\nbecause that document is not in the record. If Ayala\u2019s lawyers had\nbeen present at Olanders D.\u2019sBatsonhearing, they may have\nargued that his questionnaire showed that his position on capital\npunishment had changed over time. See Part III,infra.4The Court claims that\nOlanders D. was less than eloquent in describing his thought\nprocess.Ante,at 15. But it is not difficult to understand\nwhat he meant. In any event, as the Court later concedes,\nprospective jurors are likely to struggle when asked to express\ntheir views on the death penalty.Ante,at 16. Ana L. was no\nexception. For instance, when defense counsel first asked her to\ndescribe her thought process, she responded, \u201cUp to [when I filled\nout my questionnaire], I did not believe in putting someone to\ndeath.\u201d App. at 194. She continued: \u201cBut being that you\u2019ve given me\nthe\u2014the opportunity to come over here, seeing something that is not\ncorrect in the system, it wouldn\u2019t be no problem .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nfor me to give to come to a decision on the death penalty anymore.\u201dIbid.5The Court states that the\nprosecution\u2019s second purported race-neutral reason for striking\nOlanders D. was that his \u201cresponses\u201d were poor, but it conveniently\nneglects to mention that the responses to which the prosecution\nreferred were clearly those Olanders D. gave on his questionnaire.Ante, at 14; see App. 283 (\u201cMy observations in reading his\nquestionnaire and before even making note of his racial orientation\nwas that his responses were poor\u201d).6None of the cases the\nCourt cites are inconsistent with this logic.Miller-Elv.Dretke, 545 U.\u00a0S. 231 \u2013237 (2005),Snyder, 552\nU.\u00a0S., at 474, andRicev.Collins, 546\nU.\u00a0S. 333, 336 (2006) , all concerned direct challenges to a\ntrial court\u2019s denial of aBatsonmotion as opposed to\nproceduralBatsonclaims.",
