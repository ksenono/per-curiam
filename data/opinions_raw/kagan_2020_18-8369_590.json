LOMAX, PETITIONER v. CHRISTINA\nORTIZ-MARQUEZ, et\u00a0al.on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the tenth circuit[June 8, 2020]Justice Kagan delivered the opinion of the\nCourt.[1]To help staunch a \u201cflood of nonmeritorious\u201d\nprisoner litigation, the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995\n(PLRA) established what has become known as the three-strikes rule.Jonesv.Bock,549 U.S.\n199, 203 (2007). That rule generally prevents a prisoner from\nbringing suitin forma pauperis(IFP)\u2014that is,without first paying the filing fee\u2014if he has had three or more\nprior suits \u201cdismissed on the grounds that [they were] frivolous,\nmalicious, or fail[ed] to state a claim upon which relief may be\ngranted.\u201d 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71915(g). Today we address whether\na suit dismissed for failure to state a claim counts as a strike\nwhen the dismissal was without prejudice. We conclude that it does:\nThe text of Section 1915(g)\u2019s three-strikes provision refers to any\ndismissal for failure to state a claim, whether with prejudice or\nwithout.IPetitioner Arthur Lomax is an inmate in a\nColorado prison. He filed this suit against respondent prison\nofficials to challenge his expulsion from the facility\u2019s\nsex-offender treatment program. As is common in prison litigation,\nhe also moved for IFP status to allow his suit to go forward before\nhe pays the $400 filing fee. For that motion to succeed, Lomax must\navoid Section 1915(g). That provision bars further IFP litigation\nonce a prisoner has had at least three prior suits dismissed on\nspecified grounds.[2]1 And\nLomax is no rookie litigant. During his time in prison, he has\nalready brought three unsuccessful legal actions (against various\ncorrections officers, prosecutors, and judges). If the dispositions\nof those cases qualify as strikes under Section 1915(g), Lomax may\nnot now proceed IFP.The courts below ruled that Lomax had struck\nout. The District Court denied his motion for IFP status, finding\nthat all three of his prior suits had been dismissed for failure to\nstate a claim\u2014one of the grounds specified in Section 1915(g). See\nApp. 65\u201366.[3] On appeal, Lomax\nargued that two of those dismissals should not count as strikes\nbecause they were without prejudice, thus allowing him to file a\nlater suit on the same claim. The Court of Appeals for the Tenth\nCircuit rejected that argument. Relying on Circuit precedent, the\nCourt held it \u201cimmaterial to the strikes analysis\u201d whether a\ndismissal was with or without prejudice. 754 Fed. Appx. 756, 759\n(2018) (quotingChildsv.Miller, 713 F.3d 1262, 1266\n(CA10 2013)).The Courts of Appeals have long divided over\nwhether a dismissal without prejudice for failure to state a claim\nqualifies as a strike under Section 1915(g).[4] In line with our duty to call balls and\nstrikes, we granted certiorari to resolve the split, 589 U.\u00a0S.\n___ (2019), and we now affirm.IIThis case begins, and pretty much ends, with\nthe text of Section 1915(g). Under that provision, a prisoner\naccrues a strike for any action \u201cdismissed on the ground[\u00a0]\nthat it\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. fails to state a claim upon which\nrelief may be granted.\u201d That broad language covers all such\ndismissals: It applies to those issued both with and without\nprejudice to a plaintiff\u00a0\u2019s ability to reassert his claim in a\nlater action.[5] A strike-call\nunder Section 1915(g) thus hinges exclusively on the basis for the\ndismissal, regardless of the decision\u2019s prejudicial effect. To\nreach the opposite result\u2014counting prejudicial orders alone as\nstrikes\u2014we would have to read the simple word \u201cdismissed\u201d in\nSection 1915(g) as \u201cdismissed with prejudice.\u201d But this Court may\nnot narrow a provision\u2019s reach by inserting words Congress chose to\nomit. See,e.g.,Virginia Uranium, Inc.v.Warren, 587 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2019) (lead opinion of\nGorsuch, J.) (slip op., at 1).Indeed, to do so would violate yet another rule\nof statutory construction: \u201cIn all but the most unusual situations,\na single use of a statutory phrase must have a fixed meaning\u201d\nacross a statute.Cochise Consultancy, Inc.v.United\nStates ex\u00a0rel. Hunt, 587 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2019) (slip\nop., at 5). The PLRA includes three other provisions mentioning\n\u201cdismiss[als]\u201d for \u201cfail[ure] to state a claim\u201d\u2014each enabling\ncourts to dismisssua spontecertain prisoner suits on that\nground. \u00a7\u00a71915(e)(2)(B)(ii), 1915A(b); 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a71997e(c). No one here thinks those provisions deprive courts of\nthe ability to dismiss those suits without prejudice. See Reply\nBrief 15; Brief for Respondents 21\u201324; Brief for United States asAmicus Curiae21\u201322. Nor would that be a plausible position.\nThe broad statutory language\u2014on its face covering dismissals both\nwith and without prejudice\u2014tracks courts\u2019 ordinary authority to\ndecide whether a dismissal for failure to state a claim should have\npreclusive effect. So reading the PLRA\u2019s three-strikes rule to\napply only to dismissals with prejudice would introduce\ninconsistencies into the statute. The identical phrase would then\nbear different meanings in provisions almost next-door to each\nother.Still, Lomax maintains that the phrase\n\u201cdismissed [for] fail[ure] to state a claim\u201d in Section 1915(g) is\na \u201clegal term of art\u201d referring only to dismissals with prejudice.\nReply Brief 4. To support that view, he relies on a procedural rule\nused to answer a different question. When a court dismisses a case\nfor failure to state a claim, but neglects to specify whether the\norder is with or without prejudice, how should a later court\ndetermine its preclusive effect? Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n41(b), codifying an old equitable principle, supplies the answer:\nIt tells courts to treat the dismissal \u201cas an adjudication on the\nmerits\u201d\u2014meaning a dismissal with prejudice. SeeDurantv.Essex Co., 7 Wall. 107, 109 (1869). According to Lomax,\n\u201cSection 1915(g) should be interpreted in light of this legal\nbackdrop.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 17. He reasons: Because Rule 41(b)\npresumes that an order stating only \u201cdismissed for failure to state\na claim\u201d is with prejudice, the same language when used in Section\n1915(g) should bear that same meaning. And if so, the provision\nwould assign a strike to only with-prejudice dismissals for failure\nto state a claim.But that argument gets things backwards. The\nRule 41(b) presumption (like its older equitable counterpart) does\nnot convert the phrase \u201cdismissed for failure to state a claim\u201d\ninto a legal term of art meaning \u201cdismissed with prejudice\u201d on that\nground. To the contrary, Rule 41(b) is necessary because that\nphrase means only what it says: \u201cdismissed for failure to state a\nclaim\u201d\u2014whether or not with prejudice. In other words, the phrase\u2019s\nindifference to prejudicial effect is what creates the need for a\ndefault rule to determine the import of a dismissal when a court\nfails to make that clear. Rule 41(b), then, actually undercuts\nLomax\u2019s position: Its very existence is a form of proof that the\nlanguage used in Section 1915(g) covers dismissals both with and\nwithout prejudice. And here too, confirmation of the point comes\nfrom the PLRA\u2019s other provisions referring to \u201cdismiss[als]\u201d for\n\u201cfail[ure] to state a claim.\u201d Seesupra,at 4. If that\nphrase had really become a legal term of art implying \u201cwith\nprejudice,\u201d then those provisions would prevent courts from\ndismissing prisoner suits without prejudice for failure to state a\nclaim. But Lomax himself does not accept that improbable reading.\nSeeibid. His supposed \u201cterm of art\u201d is strangely\nfree-floating, transforming ordinary meaning in one place while\nleaving it alone in all others.Lomax also makes an argument based on the two\nother grounds for dismissal listed in Section 1915(g). Recall that\nthe provision counts as strikes dismissals of actions that are\n\u201cfrivolous\u201d or \u201cmalicious,\u201d along with those that fail to state a\nclaim. Seesupra,at 1, 2, n. 1. In Lomax\u2019s view, the first\ntwo kinds of dismissals \u201creflect a judicial determination that a\nclaim is irremediably defective\u201d\u2014that it \u201ccannot succeed and should\nnot return to court.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 11, 22 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). To \u201charmonize [all] three grounds for\nstrikes,\u201d he continues, the same must be true of dismissals for\nfailure to state a claim.Id.,at 23; seeid.,at 21\n(invoking the \u201cinterpretive canonnoscitur a sociis, a word\nis known by the company it keeps\u201d (internal quotation marks\nomitted)). So Section 1915(g), Lomax concludes, must capture only\nthe subset of those dismissals that are issued with prejudice\u2014the\nones disposing of \u201cirredeemable\u201d suits.Id.,at 21.As an initial matter, the very premise of that\nargument is mistaken. Contra Lomax\u2019s view, courts can and sometimes\ndo conclude that frivolous actions are not \u201cirremediably\ndefective,\u201d and thus dismiss them without prejudice. See,e.g.,Martsv.Hines,117 F.3d 1504, 1505 (CA5 1997); see alsoJacksonv.Florida Dept. of Financial Servs., 479 Fed. Appx. 289, 292\n(CA11 2012) (similarly if less commonly, dismissing a malicious\naction without prejudice). Indeed, this Court has suggested that a\ntrial court might abuse its discretion by dismissing an IFP suitwith prejudiceif \u201cfrivolous factual allegations [can] be\nremedied through more specific pleading.\u201dDentonv.Hernandez,504 U.S.\n25, 34 (1992). So on Lomax\u2019s own metric\u2014whether down the road\nthe plaintiff\u00a0\u2019s claim might return\u2014the dismissals he claims\nwould be outliers in Section 1915(g) in fact would have company.\nAnd because that is true, his reason for excluding those decisions\nfrom the provision collapses. If dismissals without prejudice for\nfrivolousness count as a strike under Section 1915(g), then why not\nfor failure to state a claim too?Still more fundamentally, Lomax is wrong to\nsuggest that every dismissed action encompassed in Section 1915(g)\nmust closely resemble frivolous or malicious ones. The point of the\nPLRA, as its terms show, was to cabin not only abusive but also\nsimply meritless prisoner suits. Before the PLRA, the statute\ngoverning IFP claims targeted frivolous and malicious actions, but\nno others. SeeNeitzkev.Williams,490 U.S.\n319, 328 (1989). In the PLRA, Congress chose to go\nfurther\u2014precisely by aiming as well at actions that failed to state\na claim. The theory was that a \u201cflood of nonmeritorious claims,\u201d\neven if not in any way abusive, was \u201ceffectively preclud[ing]\nconsideration of\u00a0\u201d suits more likely to succeed.Jones,\n549 U.\u00a0S., at 203. So we cannot, in the interest of\n\u201charmonization,\u201d interpret the phrase \u201cfailure to state a claim\u201d\nbased on the pre-existing terms \u201cfrivolous\u201d and \u201cmalicious.\u201d Cf.Babbittv.Sweet Home Chapter, Communities for Great\nOre.,515 U.S.\n687, 702, 705 (1995) (rejecting use of thenosciturcanon when \u201cthe Senate went out of its way to add\u201d a \u201cbroad word\u201d\nto a statute). That would defeat the PLRA\u2019sexpansionof the\nstatute beyond what was already there.IIIThe text of the PLRA\u2019s three-strikes provision\nmakes this case an easy call. A dismissal of a suit for failure to\nstate a claim counts as a strike, whether or not with prejudice. We\ntherefore affirm the judgment below.It is so ordered.Notes1Justice Thomas joins all\nbut footnote 4 of this opinion.21\u00a0The full text of the\nthree-strikes provision reads: \u201cIn no event shall a prisoner bring\na civil action or appeal a judgment in a civil action or proceeding\n[in forma pauperis] if the prisoner has, on 3 or more prior\noccasions, while incarcerated or detained in any facility, brought\nan action or appeal in a court of the United States that was\ndismissed on the grounds that it is frivolous, malicious, or fails\nto state a claim upon which relief may be granted, unless the\nprisoner is under imminent danger of serious physical injury.\u201d 28\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71915(g).3Two of the cases were\ndismissed underHeckv.Humphrey,512 U.S.\n477(1994), which holds that a claim challenging the validity\nof a conviction or sentence under 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71983 \u201cdoes\nnot accrue until the conviction or sentence has been invalidated.\u201d\n512 U.\u00a0S., at 490. In concluding that those twoHeckdismissals were for failure to state a claim, the District Court\nfollowed Circuit precedent. SeeSmithv.Veterans\nAdmin., 636 F.3d 1306, 1312 (CA10 2011). Not all Courts of\nAppeals accept that view. See,e.g.,Mejiav.Harrington, 541 Fed. Appx. 709, 710 (CA7 2013). But Lomax\ndid not raise that issue, and we therefore do not address\nit.4Four Circuits treat\ndismissals without prejudice for failure to state a claim as\nstrikes. SeeOrrv.Clements, 688 F.3d 463, 465 (CA8\n2012);Paulv.Marberry, 658 F.3d 702, 704 (CA7\n2011);O\u2019Nealv.Price, 531 F.3d 1146, 1154 (CA9\n2008);Dayv.Maynard,200 F.3d 665, 667 (CA10 1999) (per\u00a0curiam). Two\nCircuits do the opposite. SeeMillhousev.Heath, 866\nF.3d 152, 162\u2013163 (CA3 2017);McLeanv.United\nStates, 566 F.3d 391, 396\u2013397 (CA4 2009).5Note, however, that the\nprovision does not apply when a court gives a plaintiff leave to\namend his complaint. Courts often take that path if there is a\nchance that amendment can cure a deficient complaint. See Fed. Rule\nCiv. Proc. 15(a) (discussing amendments to pleadings). In that\nevent, because the suit continues, the court\u2019s action falls outside\nof Section 1915(g) and no strike accrues. See Brief for Respondents\n31\u201335 (noting that flexible amendment practices \u201censure that\npotentially meritorious prisoner suits are not hastily dismissed\nwith a strike\u201d); Brief for United States asAmicus Curiae27\u201328 (similar); Tr. of Oral Arg. 32\u201334, 44 (similar).",
