S. ____ (2008)SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESNO. 06-1321MYRNA GOMEZ-PEREZ, PETITIONERv.JOHN E.\nPOTTER, POSTMASTER GENERALon writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the first circuit[May 27, 2008]Chief Justice Roberts, with whom\nJustice Scalia and Justice Thomas join as to all but Part I,\ndissenting.The Court today holds that the\nfederal-sector provision of the Age Discrimination in Employment\nAct encompasses not only claims of age discrimination\u2014which its\nlanguage expressly provides\u2014but also claims of retaliation for\ncomplaining about age discrimination\u2014which its language does not.\nProtection against discrimination may include protection against\nretaliation for complaining about discrimination, but that is not\nalways the case. The separate treatment of each in the\nprivate-sector provision of the ADEA makes that clear. In my view,\nthe statutory language and structure, as well as the fact that\nCongress has always protected federal employees from retaliation\nthrough the established civil service process, confirm that\nCongress did not intend those employees to have a separate judicial\nremedy for retaliation under the ADEA. I respectfully dissent.ICongress enacted the Age\nDiscrimination in Employment Act of 1967, 81 Stat. 602, which at\nthe time applied only to private employers, with the purpose of\n\u201cpromot[ing] employment of older persons based on their ability\nrather than age; \u2026 [of] prohibit[ing] arbitrary age discrimination\nin employment; [and of] help[ing] employers and workers find ways\nof meeting problems arising from the impact of age on employment.\u201d\n29 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7621(b). The 1967 Act implemented this purpose in\ntwo principal ways. First, the statute made it unlawful for an\nemployer to \u201cdiscriminate against any individual \u2026 because of such\nindividual\u2019s age.\u201d \u00a7623(a)(1). Second, Congress enacted a specific\nantiretaliation provision, which made it \u201cunlawful for an employer\nto discriminate against any of his employees or applicants for\nemployment \u2026 because such individual \u2026 has opposed any practice\nmade unlawful by this section, or because such individual \u2026 has\nmade a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner\nin an investigation, proceeding, or litigation under\u201d the ADEA.\n\u00a7623(d).In the Fair Labor Standards\nAmendments of 1974 (FLSA Amendments), \u00a728(b)(2), 88 Stat. 74,\nCongress (among other things) extended the ADEA to most Executive\nBranch employees by adopting 29 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7633a. Like its\nprivate-sector counterpart, this federal-sector provision includes\na ban on discrimination on the basis of age. Unlike its\nprivate-sector counterpart, the federal-sector provision doesnotinclude a separate ban on retaliation. The\nfederal-sector provision specifies only that \u201c[a]ll personnel\nactions affecting employees or applicants for employment who are at\nleast 40 years of age [in various federal agencies] shall be made\nfree from any discrimination based on age.\u201d \u00a7633a(a).Despite the absence of an express retaliation\nprovision in \u00a7633a(a), the Court finds that the statute encompasses\nboth discrimination and retaliation claims. To support this\nproposition, the Court principally relies on our decisions inSullivanv.Little Hunting Park, Inc.,396 U. S. 229(1969), andJacksonv.Birmingham Bd. of Ed.,544 U. S. 167(2005). In my view, the\nmajority reads these cases for more than they are worth.As the majority correctly states, we held inSullivanthat 42 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71982, which prohibits race\ndiscrimination in the sale or rental of property, also provides a\ncause of action for retaliation.[Footnote 1] 396 U. S., at 237. More recently, we held inJacksonthat Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972,\n86 Stat. 373\u2014which provides in relevant part that \u201c[n]o person in\nthe United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from\nparticipation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to\ndiscrimination under any education program or activity receiving\nFederal financial assistance,\u201d 20 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a71681(a)\u2014encompasses claims of retaliation for complaints about sex\ndiscrimination. 544 U. S., at 173\u2013174.To the extent the majority takes from these\nprecedents the principle that broad antidiscrimination provisions\nmay also encompass an antiretaliation component, I do not disagree.\nThat is why I am able to join today\u2019s opinion inCBOCS West,\nInc.v.Humphries, ante, at 14 (holding that a\nretaliation claim is cognizable under 42 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71981). But\nit cannot be\u2014contrary to the majority\u2019s apparent view\u2014thatanytime Congress proscribes \u201cdiscrimination based on X,\u201d\nit means to proscribe retaliation as well. That is clear from the\nprivate-sector provision of the ADEA, which includes a ban on\n\u201cdiscriminat[ion] against any individual \u2026 because of such\nindividual\u2019s age,\u201d 29 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7623(a)(1), butalsoincludes a separate (and presumably not superfluous) ban on\nretaliation, \u00a7623(d).Indeed, we made this precise observation inJacksonitself. The respondent in that case argued that\nTitle IX\u2019s ban on discrimination could not include a cause of\naction for retaliation because Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of\n1964, like the private-sector provision of the ADEA, includes\ndiscrete discrimination and retaliation provisions. See 42 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a72000e\u20132 (discrimination), 2000e\u20133 (retaliation). We\ndistinguished Title VII on the ground that \u201cTitle IX is a broadly\nwritten general prohibition on discrimination,\u201d while \u201cTitle VII\nspells out in greater detail the conduct that constitutes\ndiscrimination in violation of that statute.\u201d 544 U. S., at 175.\nThus, while we distinguished Title VII from Title IX inJackson, we also acknowledged that not every express ban\non discrimination must be read as a ban on retaliation as well.What is more, although the majority asserts\nthatJacksonrejected the view that \u201ca claim of\nretaliation is conceptually different from a claim of\ndiscrimination,\u201dante, at 5, we have since explained that\nantidiscrimination and antiretaliation provisions are indeed\nconceptually distinct, and serve distinct purposes. InBurlington N. & S.\u00a0F.\u00a0R. Co.v.White,548\nU. S. 53(2006), we considered whether the antiretaliation\nprovision in the Title VII private-sector provision, 42 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a72000e\u20133(a)\u2014which is materially indistinguishable from\nthat in the ADEA\u2014applies \u201conly [to] those employer actions and\nresulting harms that are related to employment or the workplace.\u201d\n548 U. S., at 61. In answering that question in the negative, we\nexplained:\u201cThe antidiscrimination provision seeks a workplace\nwhere individuals are not discriminated against because of their\n[protected] status. The antiretaliation provision seeks to secure\nthat primary objective by preventing an employer from interfering\n(through retaliation) with an employee\u2019s efforts to secure or\nadvance enforcement of the Act\u2019s basic guarantees. The substantive\nprovision seeks to prevent injury to individuals based on who they\nare,i.e., their status. The antiretaliation provision\nseeks to prevent harm to individuals based on what they do,i.e., their conduct.\u201dId., at 63 (citation\nomitted).[Footnote 2]While I take fromSullivanandJacksonthe proposition that broad\nbans on discrimination, standing alone, may be read to include a\nretaliation component, the provision at issue here does not stand\nalone. And, asJacksonitself makes clear, see 544 U. S.,\nat 173, 175, \u201cthe words of a statute must be read in their context\nand with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme.\u201dDavisv.Michigan Dept. of Treasury,489 U. S. 803, 809\n(1989). Here the text and structure of the statute, the broader\nstatutory scheme of which it is a part, and distinctions between\nfederal- and private-sector employment convince me that \u00a7633a(a)\ndoes not provide a cause of action for retaliation.IIWe have explained that \u201c[w]here\nCongress includes particular language in one section of a statute\nbut omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally\npresumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the\ndisparate inclusion or exclusion.\u201dRussellov.United\nStates,464 U.\nS. 16, 23 (1983) (internal quotation marks omitted). If, as the\nmajority holds, the ban on \u201cdiscrimination based on age\u201d in\n\u00a7633a(a) encompasses both discrimination and retaliation claims, it\nis difficult to understand why Congress would have felt the need to\nspecify in \u00a7623 separate prohibitions againstboth\u201cdiscriminat[ion]\u201d \u201cbecause of [an] individual\u2019s age,\u201dandretaliation.The majority responds by noting\nthat \u201c\u00a0\u2018[n]egative implications raised by disparate provisions\nare strongest\u2019 in those instances in which the relevant statutory\nprovisions were \u2018considered simultaneously when the language\nraising the implication was inserted.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAnte, at 10\n(quotingLindhv.Murphy,521 U. S. 320, 330\n(1997)). Here, the majority notes that \u00a7623 was enacted in 1967,\nwhile \u00a7633a was not passed until 1974.Ante, at 10. Fair\nenough, but while I do not quarrel with this principle as a general\nmatter, I do not think it does the work the majority thinks it\ndoes. Congress obviously had the private-sector ADEA provision\nprominently before it when it enacted \u00a7633a, because the same bill\nthat included \u00a7633a also amended the private-sector provision. See,e.g.,\u00a728(a)(2), 88 Stat. 74 (amending the definition of\n\u201cemployer\u201d in 29 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7630(b) to include States and their\npolitical subdivisions). Indeed, it is quite odd to assume, as the\nmajority does, seeante, at 9, 12, that the Congress that\nenacted \u00a7633a was aware of and relied upon our decision inSullivan\u2014which interpreted 42 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71982, a\nwholly unrelated provision\u2014but was not attuned to its own work\nreflected in the differences between 29 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a7623 and\n633a. Even if the negative implication to be drawn from those\ndifferences may not be at its \u201cstrongest\u201d under these\ncircumstances, it is certainly strong enough.Moreover, and more to the point, we have\nrelied on the differences in language between the federal- and\nprivate-sector provisions of the ADEA specifically in our\ninterpretation of \u00a7633a. InLehmanv.Nakshian,453 U. S. 156(1981), we faced the question whether a person bringing an action\nunder \u00a7633a(c), alleging a violation of \u00a7633a(a), was entitled to a\ntrial by jury. In holding that there was no jury-trial right\navailable against the Federal Government, we relied on the fact\nthat while the ADEA\u2019s federal-sector provision did not include a\nprovision for a jury trial, the analogous grant of a right of\naction in the private-sector provision, \u00a7626(c),\n\u201cexpresslyprovides for jury trials.\u201dId.,at\n162. We reasoned that \u201cCongress accordingly demonstrated that it\nknew how to provide a statutory right to a jury trial when it\nwished to do so elsewhere in the very \u2018legislation\ncited.\u2019\u00a0\u2026\u00a0But in [\u00a7633a(c)] it failed explicitly to do\nso.\u201dIbid.(quotingGallowayv.United\nStates,319 U.\nS. 372, 389 (1943)). So too here. \u201cCongress \u2026 demonstrated that\nit knew how to\u201d provide a retaliation cause of action \u201cwhen it\nwished to do so elsewhere in the very \u2018legislation cited,\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nbut \u201cfailed explicitly to do so\u201d in \u00a7633a(a).The majority argues that this inference is\nweakened by the fact that, in \u201cthe private-sector provision,\nCongress set out a specific list of forbidden employer practices,\u201dante, at 11, while \u00a7633a(a) is a \u201cbroad, general ban on\n\u2018discrimination based on age,\u2019\u00a0\u201dante, at 12. This\npoint cuts against the majority. Section 623 drew a distinction\nbetween prohibited \u201cemployer practices\u201d that discriminate based on\nage, and retaliation. See \u00a7\u00a7623(a) (discriminatory \u201c[e]mployer\npractices\u201d), 623(d) (retaliation). Section 633a(a) phrased the\nprohibited discrimination in terms of \u201cpersonnel actions.\u201d Just as\nCongress did not regard retaliation as included within \u201cemployer\npractices,\u201d but dealt with it separately in \u00a7623(d), the\ncounterpart to \u201cemployer practices\u201d in \u00a7633a\u2014discriminatory\n\u201cpersonnel actions\u201d\u2014should similarly not be read to include\nretaliation.The argument that some meaning ought to attach\nto Congress\u2019s inclusion of an antiretaliation provision in \u00a7623 but\nnot in \u00a7633a is further supported by several other factors. To\nbegin with, Congressexpresslymade clear that the ADEA\u2019s\nprivate-sector provisions should not apply to their federal-sector\ncounterpart, by providing that \u201c[a]ny personnel action \u2026 referred\nto in subsection (a) of this section shall not be subject to, or\naffected by, any provision of\u201d the ADEA, except for one provision\nnot relevant here. \u00a7633a(f). The majority sees no \u201cmerit in\nrespondent\u2019s reliance on 29 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7633a(f).\u201dAnte,\nat 13. But again, we relied on this very provision inLehman. We explained that this subsection \u201cclearly\nemphasize[s] that [\u00a7633a] was self-contained and unaffected by\nother sections\u201d of the ADEA, 453 U. S., at 168, a fact that we used\nto support our holding that the federal-sector provision does not\nprovide a right to a jury trial, even though the private-sector\nprovision does. In short, Congress was aware that there were\nsignificant differences between the private- and federal-sector\nportions of the ADEA, and specified that no part of the former\nshould be understood to have been implicitly imported into the\nlatter.Other actions Congress took at the same time\nthat it enacted \u00a7633a in 1974 further underscore the point that\nCongress deliberately chose to exclude retaliation claims from the\nADEA\u2019s federal-sector provision. The Fair Labor Standards\nAmendments of 1974, as the Act\u2019s name suggests, dealt for the most\npart not with the ADEA, but with the Fair Labor Standards Act of\n1938, extending that statute\u2019s protections to federal employees.\nSee FLSA Amendments, \u00a76(a)(2), 88 Stat. 58. In doing so, Congress\nexplicitly subjected federal employers to the FLSA\u2019s express\nantiretaliation provision, 29 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7215(a)(3). Congress\ndidnotsimilarly subject the Federal Government to the\nexpress antiretaliation provision in the ADEA, strongly suggesting\nthat this was a conscious choice.The majority responds that this \u201cinference \u2026\nis unfounded\u201d because \u201cCongress had good reason to expect that this\nbroad ban would be interpreted in the same way thatSullivan\u2026 had interpreted the broad ban on racial\ndiscrimination in 42 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71982.\u201dAnte, at 14,\nn.\u00a06. Anything is possible, but again, it seems far more\nlikely that Congress had its eye on the private-sector provision of\nthe ADEA in crafting the federal one, rather than on one of our\nprecedents on a different statute. Seesupra, at 6.But whatever the merits of this argument, it\ndoes not rebut the import of other probative provisions of the FLSA\nAmendments. In particular, Congress specifically chose in the FLSA\nAmendments to treat States and the Federal Government differently\nwith respect to the ADEA itself. It subjected the former to the\nADEA\u2019s private-sector provision, see FLSA Amendments, \u00a728(a)(2), 88\nStat. 74\u2014including the express prohibition against retaliation in\n\u00a7623(d)\u2014while creating \u00a7633a as a stand-alone prohibition against\ndiscrimination in federal employment, without an antiretaliation\nprovision, see \u00a728(b)(2),ibid.This decision evinces a\ndeliberate legislative choicenotto extend those portions\nof the ADEA\u2019s private-sector provisions that are not expressly\nincluded in \u00a7633a, as of course Congress specified in \u00a7633a(f).Given all this, it seems safe to say that the\ntext and structure of the statute strongly support the proposition\nthat Congress did not intend to include a cause of action for\nretaliation against federal employees in \u00a7633a(a).IIIButwhywould Congress\nallow retaliation suits against private-sector and state employers,\nbut not against the Federal Government? The answer is that such\nretaliation was dealt with not through a judicial remedy, but\nrather the way retaliation in the federal workplace was typically\naddressed\u2014through the established civil service system, with its\ncomprehensive protection for Government workers. Congress was quite\nfamiliar with that detailed administrative system\u2014one that already\nexisted for most federal employees, but not for private ones. This\napproach, unlike the Court\u2019s, is consistent with the fact that\nCongress has recognized that regulation of the civil service is a\ncomplex issue, requiring \u201ccareful attention to conflicting policy\nconsiderations\u201d and \u201cbalancing governmental efficiency and the\nrights of employees,\u201dBushv.Lucas,462 U. S. 367, 388, 389\n(1983). The resulting system often requires remedies different from\nthose found to be appropriate for the private sector (or even for\nthe States).ABefore Title VII was extended to\nfederal employees in 1972, discrimination in federal employment on\nthe basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin was\nprohibited by executive order. See Exec. Order No. 11478, 34 Fed.\nReg. 12985 (1969). Civil service regulations implemented this\npolicy by authorizing Executive Branch employees to bring\nadministrative complaints for allegedly dis- criminatory acts,\nincluding \u201cpersonnel action[s],\u201d 5 CFR \u00a7\u00a7713.211, 713.214(a)(1)(i)\n(1972). These regula- tions further provided that such\ncomplainants, their representatives, and witnesses \u201cshall be free\nfrom restraint, interference, coercion, discrimination, or re-\nprisal\u201d for their involvement in the complaint proc- ess.\n\u00a7\u00a7713.214(b) (complainants and representatives), 713.218(e)\n(witnesses).The Civil Service Commission\n(CSC) promulgated a detailed scheme through which federal employees\ncould vindicate these rights, including the express antiretaliation\nprotections. More serious personnel actions, known as \u201cadverse\nactions,\u201d could be challenged before the employing agency and\nappealed to the CSC, see \u00a7\u00a7713.219(a) and (b), 752.203, 771.202,\n771.208, 771.222, while less serious personnel actions and \u201cany\n[other] matter of concern or dissatisfaction\u201d could be challenged\nunder alternative procedures that were also appealable to the CSC,\nsee \u00a7\u00a7713.217(b), 713.218, 713.219(a) and (c), 713.231(a),\n771.302(a). Retaliation was proscribed in all events. See,e.g., \u00a7\u00a7713.219(a) and (c) (incorporating Part 771\nantiretaliation provisions to complaint procedures except certain\nappeals to CSC); \u00a7\u00a7771.105(a)(1) and (b)(1), 771.211(e)\n(antiretaliation provisions for CSC appeals).In 1972, Congress applied Title VII to the\nfederal-sector, Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972 (EEO Act),\n\u00a711, 86 Stat. 111, mandating that \u201c[a]ll personnel actions\u201d with\nrespect to federal employees \u201cshall be made free from any\ndiscrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national\norigin.\u201d 42 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a72000e\u201316(a). Congress empowered the CSC\n\u201cto enforce the provisions of subsection (a) through appropriate\nremedies,\u201d and to \u201cissue such rules, regulations, orders and\ninstructions as it deems necessary and appropriate to carry out its\nresponsibilities under this section.\u201d \u00a72000e\u201316(b).Under this grant of authority, as well as its\nprior authority under statute and executive order, the CSC revised\nits regulations both \u201cto implement the [EEO Act] and to strengthen\nthe system of complaint processing.\u201d 37 Fed. Reg. 22717 (1972)\n(Part 713 Subpart B). As with its prior system of administrative\nenforcement, the CSC distinguished between \u201ccomplaints of\ndiscrimination on grounds of race, color, religion, sex, or\nnational origin,\u201d 5 CFR \u00a7713.211 (1973), on the one hand, and\ncharges by a \u201ccomplainant, his representative, or a witness who\nalleges restraint, interference, coercion, discrimination, or\nreprisal in connection with the presentation of a complaint,\u201d\n\u00a7713.262(a), on the other. The regulations imposed upon employing\nagencies the obligation of \u201ctimely investigation and resolution of\ncomplaints including complaints of coercion and reprisal,\u201d 37 Fed.\nReg. 22717; see also 5 CFR \u00a7713.220, and made clear the procedures\nfor processing retaliation claims, \u00a7\u00a7713.261, 713.262. The\nregulations further mandated that the CSC \u201crequire the [employing]\nagency to take whatever action is appropriate\u201d with respect to\nallegations of retaliation if the agency itself has \u201cnot completed\nan appropriate inquiry,\u201d \u00a7713.262(b)(1).Thus, leading up to the enactment of 29 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a7633a in 1974, the CSC\u2019s comprehensive regulatory scheme\nset forth a broadly applicable remedy for retaliation against\nfederal employees for filing complaints or otherwise participating\nin the EEO process. And when Congress empowered the CSC in 1974 to\n\u201cenforce the provisions of [\u00a7633a(a)] through appropriate\nremedies,\u201d and to \u201cissue such rules, regulations, orders, and\ninstructions as it deems necessary and appropriate to carry out its\nresponsibilities\u201d under that statute, \u00a728(b)(2), 88 Stat. 75, the\nassumption that Congress expected the CSC to create an\nadministrative antiretaliation remedy, just as it had for\ncomplaints of discrimination under Title VII, is compelling. And\nsure enough, the CSC did just that promptly after \u00a7633a was\nenacted. See 39 Fed. Reg. 24351 (1974); 5 CFR \u00a7713.511 (1975).Given this history of addressing retaliation\nthrough administrative means, combined with the complicated nature\n(relative to the private sector) of federal personnel practices, it\nis therefore by no means anomalous that Congress would have dealt\nwith the \u201cprimary objective\u201d of combating age discrimination\nthrough a judicial remedy,Burlington, 548 U. S., at 63,\nbut left it to expert administrators used to dealing with personnel\nmatters in the federal work force to \u201csecure that primary objective\nby preventing an employer from interfering (through retaliation)\nwith an employee\u2019s efforts to secure or advance enforcement of the\nAct\u2019s basic guarantees,\u201dibid.BThe majority discounts the\nabove argument as \u201cunsupported speculation.\u201d Ante, at 14. It\nseems to me that the fact that the Executive Branch had always\ntreated discrimination and retaliation as distinct, and that it\nenacted administrative remedies for retaliation almost immediately\nafter the passage of the Title VII and ADEA federal-sector\nprovisions, provide plenty of support. But even if the majority is\nright, the view that Congress intended to treat retaliation for age\ndiscrimination complaints as a problem to be dealt with primarily\nthrough administrative procedures, rather than through the judicial\nprocess in the first instance, is confirmed by Congress\u2019s passage\nof the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA), 92 Stat. 1111.The CSRA, as amended, has a\ndetailed comprehensive antiretaliation provision, which generally\nmakes it unlawful for Executive Branch employers to\u201ctake or fail to take, or threaten to take or fail\nto take, any personnel action against any employee or applicant for\nemployment because of \u2026 (A) the exercise of any appeal, complaint,\nor grievance right granted by any law, rule, or regulation [or] (B)\ntestifying for or otherwise lawfully assisting any individual in\nthe exercise of any right referred to in subparagraph (A).\u201d 5 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a72302(b)(9).[Footnote\n3]This antiretaliation provision,\nwhich plainly applies to retaliation for exercising rights under\nthe civil rights statutes, including the ADEA, is supported by a\nhost of administrative remedies. If the alleged retaliation results\nin adverse actions such as removal, suspension for more than 14\ndays, or reduction in pay, see \u00a77512, an appeal can be taken\ndirectly to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), \u00a7\u00a77513(d),\n7701, with judicial review in the United States Court of Appeals\nfor the Federal Circuit, \u00a77703(b)(1). Retaliation claims based on\nless serious allegations are first investigated by the Office of\nSpecial Counsel. If the Office finds that there are reasonable\ngrounds supporting the retaliation charge, it must report its\ndetermination to, and may seek corrective action from, the MSPB.\n\u00a7\u00a71214(a)(1)(A), (b)(2)(B), (C), and 1214(c). Again, judicial\nreview in the Federal Circuit is available. \u00a77703(b)(1). In all\nevents, upon a finding that retaliation has in fact occurred, the\nMSPB has the authority to order corrective action, \u00a7\u00a71214(b)(4),\n7701(b)(2), to order attorney\u2019s fees on appeal, \u00a77701(g), and to\ndiscipline federal employees responsible for retaliatory acts,\n\u00a71215.[Footnote 4]To be sure, the CSRA was enacted after \u00a7633a.\nNevertheless, we have explained, in the same context of federal\nemployee remedies, that the \u201cclassic judicial task of reconciling\nmany laws enacted over time, and getting them to \u2018make sense\u2019 in\ncombination, necessarily assumes that the implications of a statute\nmay be altered by the implications of a later statute.\u201dUnited\nStatesv.Fausto,484 U. S. 439, 453\n(1988). That is precisely the situation here.Indeed, this is particularly true with respect\nto Congress\u2019s regulation of federal employment. We have explained\nthat the CSRA is an \u201cintegrated scheme of administrative and\njudicial review, designed to balance the legitimate interests of\nthe various categories of federal employees with the needs of sound\nand efficient administration.\u201dId., at 445. Perhaps the\nCSRA\u2019s \u201ccivil service remedies [are] not as effective as an\nindividual damages remedy\u201d that can be obtained in federal court,Bush, 462 U. S., at 372, or perhaps a quicker and more\nfamiliar administrative remedyismore effective as a\npractical matter. That is not the issue. Cf.id., at 388\n(the question whether a judicial remedy against a federal employer\nfor a First Amendment violation should be implied \u201cobviously cannot\nbe answered simply by noting that existing remedies do not provide\ncomplete relief for the plaintiff\u201d). The CSRA establishes an\n\u201celaborate, comprehensive scheme that encompasses substantive\nprovisions forbidding arbitrary action by supervisors and\nprocedures\u2014administrative and judicial\u2014by which improper action may\nbe redressed.\u201dId., at 385. Retaliation as a general\nmatter was already addressed for federal employees. I would not\nread into \u00a7633a a judicial remedy for retaliation when\nCongress\u2014which has \u201cdeveloped considerable familiarity with\nbalancing governmental efficiency and the rights of employees,\u201did., at 389\u2014chose to provide a detailed administrative\none.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*The question whether a ban\nagainst \u201cdiscrimination based on\u201d a protected status such as age\ncan also be read to encompass a ban on retaliation can be answered\nonly after careful scrutiny of the particular provision in\nquestion. In this case, an analysis of the statutory language of\n\u00a7633a and the broader scheme of which it is a part confirms that\nCongress did not intend implicitly to create a judicial remedy for\nretaliation against federal employees, when it did so expressly for\nprivate-sector employees. Congress was not sloppy in creating this\ndistinction; it did so for good reason: because the federal\nworkplace is governed by comprehensive regulation, of which\nCongress was well aware, while the private sector is not.For these reasons, I would affirm the judgment\nof the Court of Appeals.Footnote 1To the extent there was any disagreement\nabout whetherSullivanv.Little Hunting Park,\nInc.,396 U. S. 229(1969), was really a\nretaliation case, or whether it dealt only with third-party\nstanding, the view put forth by the Court won the day inJacksonv.Birmingham Bd. of Ed.,544 U. S. 167(2005). Compareid., at 176, and n.\u00a01, withid., at 194\n(Thomas, J., dissenting). Whatever the merits of this disagreement,\nI acceptJackson\u2019s (and the Court\u2019s) interpretation as a\nmatter ofstare decisis. SeeCBOCS West, Inc.v.Humphries, ante, at 3.Footnote 2The Court views this discussion ofBurlingtonas \u201c[s]uggesting that [the Court has] retreated\nfrom the reasoning ofSullivanandJackson.\u201dAnte, at 5, n.\u00a01. Not a bit. The discussion simply\npoints out whatBurlingtonplainly said: that there is a\ndistinction between discrimination and retaliation claims. That\ndoes not mean Congress cannot address both in the same provision,\nas we held it did inSullivanandJacksonand as\nwe hold today it did inCBOCS West, Inc.,ante,\nat 14. But it does confirm that Congress may choose to separate the\ntwo, as the private-sector provision of the ADEA, as well as the\nportion of Title VII interpreted inBurlington, makes\nclear.Footnote 3Neither 29 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7633a nor the CSRA\ncover employees of Congress or of the Executive Office of the\nPresident and Executive Residence of the White House. See \u00a7633a(a);\n5 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a72302(a)(2)(B). But Congress has expressly extended\nthe protections of the ADEA to such employees, 2 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a71311(a)(2) (Congress); 3 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7411(a)(2) (White House),\nand provided them with an express retaliation remedy, 2 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a71317; 3 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7417(a).Footnote 4The Postal Service\u2014Gomez-Perez\u2019s\nemployer\u2014operates under its own personnel system. But the Postal\nService\u2019s Employee and Labor Relations Manual (ELM) prohibits \u201cany\naction, event, or course of conduct that \u2026 subjects any person to\nreprisal for prior involvement in EEO activity.\u201d ELM \u00a7665.23, pp.\n681\u2013682 (June 2007).",
