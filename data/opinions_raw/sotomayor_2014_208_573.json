CLS\nBANK INTERNATIONAL et\u00a0al.on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the federal circuit[June 19, 2014]Justice Sotomayor,\nwith whom Justice Ginsburg and Justice Breyer join, concurring.I adhere to the view\nthat any \u201cclaim that merely describes a method of doing\nbusiness does not qualify as a \u2018process\u2019 under\n\u00a7101.\u201d Bilski v. Kappos, 561 U.\u00a0S. 593, 614 (2010)\n(Stevens, J., concurring in judgment); see also In\u00a0re Bilski,\n545 F.\u00a03d 943, 972 (CA Fed. 2008) (Dyk, J., concurring)\n(\u201cThere is no suggestion in any of th[e] early [English]\nconsideration of process patents that processes for organizing\nhuman activity were or ever had been patent- able\u201d). As in\nBilski, however, I further believe that the method claims at issue\nare drawn to an abstract idea. Cf. 561 U.\u00a0S., at 619 (opinion\nof Stevens, J.). I therefore join the opinion of the Court.",
