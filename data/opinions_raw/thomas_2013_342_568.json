    "text": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES_________________No. 11\u2013820_________________ROSELVA CHAIDEZ, PETITIONERv.UNITED\nSTATESon writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the seventh circuit[February 20, 2013]Justice Thomas, concurring in the\njudgment.InPadillav.Kentucky,559 U.S.\n356(2010), this Court held that the Sixth Amendment requires\nan attorney for a criminal defendant to apprise his client of the\nrisk of deportation created by a guilty plea. I dissented. The\nSixth Amendment provides that \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions,\u201d an\naccused enjoys the right \u201cto have the Assistance of Counsel for his\ndefence.\u201d By its terms, this right extends \u201cto legal advice\ndirectly related to defense against prosecution of the charged\noffense,\u201d and \u201c[t]here is no basis in text or in principle\u201d to\nexpand the reach of this guarantee to guidance concerning the\ncollateral consequences of a guilty plea.Id., at ___ (slip\nop., at 2\u20133) (Scalia, J., dissenting). Today, the Court finds thatPadillaannounced a new rule of constitutional law and that,\nunder our decision inTeaguev.Lane,489 U.S.\n288(1989), \u201cdefendants whose convictions became final prior toPadillatherefore cannot benefit from its holding.\u201dAnte,at 15. I continue to believe thatPadillawas\nwrongly decided and that the Sixth Amendment does not extend\u2014either\nprospectively or retrospectively\u2014to advice concerning the\ncollateral consequences arising from a guilty plea. I, there- fore,\nbelieve that theTeagueanalysis is unnecessary and thus\nconcur only in the judgment.",
