    "text": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES_________________No. 19\u2013896_________________TAE D. JOHNSON, ACTING DIRECTOR OF U.\u00a0S.\nIMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS ENFORCE- MENT, et\u00a0al., PETITIONERSv.ANTONIO ARTEAGA-MARTINEZon writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the third circuit[June 13, 2022]Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Gorsuch\njoins as to Part I, concurring.I join the Court\u2019s opinion because it correctly\ndecides that 8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71231(a)(6) does not require\nperiodic, 6-month bond hearings. I write separately to make three\npoints.IFirst, we lack jurisdiction to hear this case.\nUnder 8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71252(b)(9), a federal court has\njurisdiction to review \u201cquestions of law and fact .\u00a0.\u00a0.\narising from any action taken or proceeding brought to remove an\nalien .\u00a0.\u00a0. only\u201d in two circumstances: (1)\u00a0when the\ncourt reviews a \u201cfinal order\u201d of removal, or (2)\u00a0when \u00a71252\notherwise grants jurisdiction. See,e.g.,Johnsonv.Guzman Chavez, 594 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2021) (Thomas, J.,\nconcurring in part and concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 1);Jenningsv.Rodriguez, 583 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___\u2013___\n(2018) (same) (slip op., at 3\u20134). This jurisdictional zipper clause\n\u201ccover[s] all claims related to removal proceedings,\u201d including\ndetention-related \u201cwithholding-of-removal claims.\u201dGuzman\nChavez,594 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 2) (internal\nquotation marks omitted); see alsoJennings, 583 U.\u00a0S.,\nat ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 4\u20137).Because Arteaga-Martinez does not seek review of\na final removal order or otherwise invoke \u00a71252, and because his\nclaim \u201caris[es] from\u201d his removal proceedings, I would vacate and\nremand with instructions to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.\nNonetheless, \u201cbecause the Court has held that we have jurisdiction\nin cases like these, and the Court\u2019s opinion is otherwise correct,\u201d\nI join it in full.Guzman Chavez, 594 U.\u00a0S., at ___\n(slip op., at 2) (internal quotation marks omitted).IISecond, as I have explained elsewhere, there\nis considerable historical evidence that the Due Process Clause\ndoes not \u201capply to laws governing the removal of aliens.\u201dSessionsv.Dimaya, 584 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2018)\n(dissenting opinion) (slip op., at 6). But even assuming the Due\nProcess Clause extends to some aliens contesting their\nremovability, it does not protect from detention an alien who, like\nArteaga-Martinez, does not challenge his final removal order.\nIllegal aliens deemed removable have no \u201cright of release into this\ncountry.\u201dZadvydasv.Davis,533\nU.S. 678, 703 (2001) (Scalia, J., dissenting). Although the\nCourt properly declines to decide Arteaga-Martinez\u2019s due process\nclaim, seeante,at 9, we should revisit whether the Due\nProcess Clause applies at all in this context.IIIThird, this case illustrates why we should\noverruleZadvydasat the earliest opportunity. There, the\nCourt held that \u00a71231(a)(6) \u201cwould raise a serious constitutional\nproblem\u201d under the Fifth Amendment if it permitted \u201cindefinite\ndetention of an alien.\u201dId., at 690. To avoid that supposed\n\u201cproblem,\u201d the Court deemed \u201cambiguous\u201d the statutory authorization\nthat a removable alien \u201cmay be detained beyond the removal period,\u201d\nand then, clothed in constitutional garb, invoked that manufactured\nambiguity to graft a made-up rule onto \u00a71231(a)(6).Id.,at\n697. Namely, the Court decided that immigration authorities can\ndetain an alien only long enough to accomplish the \u201cbasic purpose\n[of] effectuating an alien\u2019s removal\u201d and must release him \u201conce\nremoval is no longer reasonably foreseeable.\u201dId.,at 697,\n699. The \u201cpresumptively reasonable\u201d detention period, the Court\ndeclared, was six months.Id.,at 701. The Court offered no\ntextual support for that (or any) length of time. Seeibid.As we later implied inJennings, the\nconstitutional-avoidance canon cannot justify adoption of such an\nimplausible construction of \u00a71231(a)(6). See 583 U.\u00a0S., at ___\n(slip op., at 12). And, until we overruleZadvydas, it will\ncontinue to invite nothing but mischief. An ill-defined, quasi-\nconstitutional command of \u201creasonableness\u201d inevitably encourages\ncourts to fashion procedural rules with no basis in statutory text.\nWe confronted that mischief inJennings, see 583 U.\u00a0S.,\nat ___ (slip op., at 14) (reversing the Ninth Circuit for \u201call but\nignor[ing] the statutory text\u201d and instead \u201creadingZadvydas.\u00a0.\u00a0. as essentially granting a license to graft a time\nlimit onto the text of \u00a71225(b)\u201d), and we do so again today,\ncompareante,at 8, withGuerrero-Sanchezv.Warden York County Prison, 905 F.3d 208, 223 (CA3 2018). We\nwill be forced to engage in this jurisprudential whack-a-mole until\nwe recognize thatZadvydaswas wrong the day it was decided\nand thus does not warrant \u201cstare decisiseffect.\u201dClarkv.Martinez,543 U.S.\n371, 401 (2005) (Thomas, J., dissenting); see alsoGamblev.United States, 587 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___\n(2019) (Thomas, J., concurring) (slip op., at 17) (\u201c[W]e should not\ninvokestare decisisto uphold precedents that are\ndemonstrably erroneous\u201d).*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*These three points notwithstanding, the\nCourt\u2019s opinion correctly interprets \u00a71231(a)(6). Accordingly, I\nconcur.",
