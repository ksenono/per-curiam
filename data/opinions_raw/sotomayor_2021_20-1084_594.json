Dunn, Commissioner, Alabama\nDepartment of Correctionsv.Matthew Reeveson petition for writ of certiorari to the\nunited states court of appeals for the eleventh circuitNo. 20\u20131084.\u2003Decided July 2, 2021Justice Sotomayor, with whom Justice Kagan\njoins, dissenting.UnderStricklandv.Washington,466 U.S.\n668(1984), courts must assess a defendant\u2019s claim that his\nattorney failed to provide constitutionally effective assistance\n\u201cin light of all the circumstances.\u201dId., at 690. No single\ntype of evidence is a prerequisite to relief. Therefore, as the\nmajority implicitly acknowledges, aper\u00a0serule that a\nhabeas petitioner\u2019s claim fails if his attorney did not testify at\nan evidentiary hearing is flatly incompatible withStrickland.The Court of Criminal Appeals of Alabama applied\nprecisely such a rule in this case. When respondent Matthew Reeves\nraised several ineffective-assistance-of-counsel (IAC) claims in\nstate postconviction proceedings, the court stated, in no uncertain\nterms (and underlined for emphasis), that \u201cto overcome the strong\npresumption of effectiveness,a Rule 32 petitioner must, at his\nevidentiary hearing, question trial counsel regarding his or her\nactions and reasoning.\u201dReevesv.State, 226 So.\n3d 711, 748 (2016) (internal quotation marks omitted). Applying\nthat rule \u201c[i]n this case,\u201d the court held that \u201cReeves\u2019s failure\nto call his attorneys to testify is fatal to his claims of\nineffective assistance of counsel.\u201dId., at 749. Reeves then\nsought habeas relief in federal court. Based on the state court\u2019s\nclear holding, the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit\nproperly determined that the state court\u2019s use of theper\u00a0serule was an unreasonable application ofStrickland.Reevesv.Commissioner,Ala.Dept.of Corrections, 836 Fed. Appx. 733,\n744 (2020) (per\u00a0curiam).Through linguistic contortion, the Court today\nrescues the state court\u2019s decision by construing it not to apply aper\u00a0serule at all. Based on that implausible reading,\nthe Court summarily reverses the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s grant of\nrelief. The lengths to which this Court goes to ensure that Reeves\nremains on death row are extraordinary. I respectfully dissent.IAIn 1998, Reeves was convicted of capital\nmurder for a brutal crime he committed when he was 18 years old. By\na vote of 10 to 2, a divided jury recommended that Reeves be\nsentenced to death, and the trial court accepted that\nrecommendation.During his trial, Reeves was initially\nrepresented by two attorneys, Blanchard McLeod and Marvin Wiggins.\nReeves\u2019 counsel moved for the appointment of a neuropsychologist,\nDr. John Goff, to conduct an intellectual disability evaluation.\nWhen the motion was denied, Reeves\u2019 counsel sought rehearing. They\nexplained that they had collected \u201chundreds of pages of\npsychological, psychometric and behavioral analysis material\nrelating to [Reeves].\u201d Electronic Case Filing in No. 1:17\u2013cv\u201300061\n(SD Ala.) (ECF), Doc. 23\u20131, p. 74. That material, McLeod had\nrepresented in court, was \u201cexceptionally pertinent\u201d to Reeves\u2019\npenalty phase defense. ECF Doc. 23\u20133, at 96. Counsel stated that\nretaining \u201ca clinical neuropsychologist\u201d like Dr. Goff was \u201cthe\nonly avenue open to the defense to compile this information\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. and present [it] in an orderly and informative\nfashion to the jury.\u201d ECF Doc. 23\u20131, at 74\u201375. The state court\ngranted the request and provided funding to hire Dr. Goff.Id., at 81. Around the same time, McLeod was replaced by\nanother attorney, Thomas Goggans. 836 Fed. Appx., at 736.Reeves\u2019 new team, Goggans and Wiggins, failed to\nfollow through on hiring a neuropsychologist. As Dr. Goff later\ntestified, in the more than three months between his appointment\nand the penalty phase trial, Reeves\u2019 attorneys \u201cjust never called.\u201d\nECF Doc. 23\u201324, at 68. They also never hired any other\nneuropsychologist to review the evidence and evaluate Reeves for\nintellectual disability. 836 Fed. Appx., at 748. Instead, on the\nday of the penalty phase trial, counsel contacted Dr. Kathleen\nRonan, a clinical psychologist who had previously evaluated Reeves\nfor competence to stand trial and his mental state at the time of\nthe offense. ECF Doc. 23\u201326, at 82\u201384. She had never evaluated\nReeves for intellectual disability, and she had not spoken with\nGoggans or Wiggins until \u201cthe day that [she] testified.\u201dId., at 84.Dr. Ronan informed Reeves\u2019 counsel that her\nprior evaluation would not serve their purposes.Ibid. As\nshe later explained, assessing Reeves for intellectual disability\n\u201cwas not within the scope of [her] evaluation.\u201dIbid. Had\nshe been hired to conduct such an assessment, she would have\nadministered a full IQ test and conducted other evaluations\ndesigned to diagnose intellectual disability.Id., at 85\u201387.\nInstead, Dr. Ronan had only administered part of an IQ test and\nfound that Reeves\u2019 verbal IQ \u201cwas not in a level that they would\ncall him [intellectually disabled].\u201d ECF Doc. 23\u20138, at 155; see\nalso ECF Doc. 23\u201326, at 85. An expert for the State later\nadministered a full IQ test, however, showing that Reeves\u2019 IQ was\nwell within the range for intellectual disability.Reeves,\n226 So. 3d, at 737; ECF Doc. 23\u201325, at 24; ECF Doc. 23\u201324, at\n26.Nevertheless, Reeves\u2019 counsel called Dr. Ronan\nto testify. The only other witnesses counsel called were Reeves\u2019\nmother and a police detective. The entire penalty phase trial\nlasted just one and a half hours. ECF Doc. 23\u201314, at 154. Reviewing\nthe record, the trial judge found that \u201c[t]he only evidence that\n[he could] consider in mitigation of this offense .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nis the evidence of [Reeves\u2019] age and [his] youthfulness.\u201d ECF Doc.\n23\u20138, at 212. Concluding that such limited evidence would not\noutweigh the aggravating circumstances, the court sentenced Reeves\nto death.Ibid.BIn 2002, Reeves filed a motion for state\npostconviction relief under Alabama Rule of Criminal Procedure 32\n(known as a Rule 32 petition). Reeves alleged that his trial\ncounsel had been constitutionally ineffective in several ways,\nincluding by failing to hire a neuropsychologist to evaluate him\nfor intellectual disability.The state court held a 2-day evidentiary hearing\non Reeves\u2019 claims. Reeves called Dr. Goff to testify. At the\nrequest of Reeves\u2019 postconviction counsel, Dr. Goff had reviewed\nReeves\u2019 mental health and school records and administered \u201ca\nbattery of tests designed to assess Mr. Reeves\u2019 IQ, cognitive\nabilities, and adaptive functioning.\u201d 836 Fed. Appx., at 737. Dr.\nGoff found that Reeves\u2019 IQ scores were 71 and 73,[1] showing that Reeves \u201chas significantly\nsubaverage intellectual functioning,\u201d and that he \u201chas significant\ndeficits in multiple areas of adaptive functioning.\u201dIbid.\nThese deficits manifested before Reeves turned 18 years old. ECF\nDoc. 23\u201324, at 25\u201326, 65\u201367. Based on his findings, Dr. Goff\nconcluded that Reeves is intellectually disabled. 836 Fed. Appx.,\nat 737. Dr. Goff testified that \u201chad Mr. Reeves\u2019 trial counsel\nasked him to evaluate Mr. Reeves years earlier for the purpose of\ntestifying at trial, he would have performed similar evaluations\nand reached the same conclusions.\u201dIbid.Reeves\u2019 trial counsel did not testify at the\nRule 32 hearing. At the beginning of the hearing, the State had\ndeclared that it intended to call Goggans and Wiggins to \u201cexplain\nwhy they did certain things and maybe why they didn\u2019t do certain\nthings.\u201d ECF Doc. 23\u201324, at 14. But at the conclusion of the\nhearing, the State \u201cdecided not to call trial counsel.\u201d ECF Doc.\n23\u201325, at 86.The state court denied Reeves\u2019 motion for\npostconviction relief. On appeal, Reeves argued that the lower\ncourt had \u201cerred in ignoring substantial evidence in support of\n[his IAC claim] on the basis that he did not call counsel to\ntestify.\u201d ECF Doc. 23\u201329, at 45. In response, the State argued that\nbecause \u201cReeves failed to call either of his trial attorneys to\ntestify concerning their decision to call Dr. Ronan rather than Dr.\nGoff,\u201d the lower court \u201cproperly presumed that they acted\nreasonably.\u201dId., at 199\u2013200.The Court of Criminal Appeals of Alabama agreed\nwith the State, rejecting Reeves\u2019 contention that \u201ctestimony from\ncounsel is not necessary to prove any claim of ineffective\nassistance of counsel.\u201dReeves, 226 So. 3d, at 747. That\nargument, the court reasoned, \u201cfail[ed] to take into account the\nrequirement that courts indulge a strong presumption that counsel\nacted reasonably, a presumption that must be overcome byevidenceto the contrary.\u201dIbid. (emphasis in\noriginal). The court then specified what that evidence must be:\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018[T]o overcome the strong presumption of effectiveness,a\nRule 32 petitioner must, at his evidentiary hearing, question trial\ncounsel regarding his or her actions and reasoning.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId., at 748 (emphasis in original; quotingStallworthv.State, 171 So. 3d 53, 92 (Ala. Crim. App. 2013)). The\ncourt cited over half a dozen cases supporting thatper\u00a0serule. See 226 So. 3d, at 748. It then applied\nthe rule to Reeves, explaining that \u201c[i]n this case, Reeves\u2019s\nfailure to call his attorneys to testify is fatal to his claims of\nineffective assistance of counsel.\u201dId., at 749.Reeves filed a petition for a writ of certiorari\nseeking review of the state court\u2019s decision, which this Court\ndenied. I dissented, joined by Justice Ginsburg and Justice Kagan.\nWe pointed out that the state court had applied aper\u00a0serule \u201cthat counsel must testify in order for a\npetitioner to succeed on a federal constitutional\nineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim.\u201dReevesv.Alabama, 583 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 2).\nEven the State did not defend the constitutionality of such a rule.\nSeeibid.CReeves then filed a federal habeas petition\npursuant to 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72254. The District Court denied\nReeves\u2019 petition and his motion for reconsideration. See 2019 WL\n1938805, *11 (SD Ala., May 1, 2019). The Eleventh Circuit reversed\nin relevant part. It read the state appellate court\u2019s decision to\n\u201ctrea[t] Mr. Reeves\u2019 failure to call his counsel to testify as aper\u00a0sebar to relief\u2014despite ample evidence in the\nrecord to overcome the presumption of adequate representation.\u201d 836\nFed. Appx., at 744. In so doing, the state court \u201cunreasonably\nappliedStrickland.\u201dIbid. The Eleventh Circuit\naccordingly reviewed Reeves\u2019 claimde\u00a0novoand found\nthat Reeves had proved ineffective assistance of counsel.Id., at 747\u2013753.The Eleventh Circuit was not alone in\ninterpreting the state court\u2019s decision to apply a \u201ccategorical\nrule.\u201dId., at 744. Less than a month earlier, the Court of\nCriminal Appeals of Alabama (the same court that had issued the\ndecision in question) denied another defendant\u2019s IAC claim. Once\nagain, the court stated itsper\u00a0serule: \u201c[T]o overcome\nthe strong presumption of effectiveness, a Rule 32 petitioner must,\nat his evidentiary hearing, question trial counsel regarding his or\nher actions and reasoning.\u201dStatev.M.D.D., ___ So. 3d ___, ___, 2020 WL 6110694,\n*7 (Oct. 16, 2020) (internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis\ndeleted). In support, the court cited its prior decision inReeves, which it summarized as \u201cholding that [a] Rule 32\npetitioner had failed to prove his claims of ineffective assistance\nof trial and appellate counsel because he did not call his trial or\nappellate counsel to testify at the Rule 32 evidentiary hearing.\u201dId., at *8. As in Reeves\u2019 case, the court inM.D.D. held that \u201cthe failure to have trial\ncounsel testify is fatal to M.D.D.\u2019s claims of ineffective\nassistance of counsel.\u201dIbid.[2]The State petitioned this Court to review the\nEleventh Circuit\u2019s decision inReeves. Despite the Alabama\ncourt\u2019s plain embrace of aper\u00a0serule, the State\naccused the Eleventh Circuit of too \u201creadily attributing error to\nthe state court\u201d by interpreting its decision to \u201cpurportedly\ncreat[e] and us[e] this per\u00a0se rule.\u201d Pet. for Cert. i. On\nthat basis, the State asked this Court to reverse summarily the\nEleventh Circuit.Id., at 30.IIThe sole question presented in this case is\nwhether the Court of Criminal Appeals of Alabama applied a\ncategorical rule that Reeves\u2019 failure to call his attorneys to\ntestify was fatal to his IAC claim as a matter of law. No one\ndisputes that such a rule would be an \u201cunreasonable application\u201d ofStricklandand its progeny. 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a72254(d)(1); see alsoante, at 1, 10; Pet. for Cert. 1.\nUnder those decisions, no single type of evidence, such as\ncounsel\u2019s testimony, is a prerequisite to relief.[3] SeeRoev.Flores-Ortega,528 U.S.\n470, 478 (2000) (describingStrickland\u2019s\n\u201ccircumstance-specific reasonableness inquiry\u201d);Williamsv.Taylor,529 U.S.\n362, 391 (2000) (explaining that \u201ctheStricklandtest\n\u2018of necessity requires a case-by-case examination of the\nevidence\u2019\u00a0\u201d).The Court of Criminal Appeals improperly applied\nsuch aper\u00a0serule here. It began by invoking Reeves\u2019\nburden \u201cto present evidence\u201d sufficient to overcome the \u201cstrong\npresumption that counsel acted reasonably.\u201dReeves, 226 So.\n3d, at 751 (emphasis deleted). It then ignored all of the evidence\nthat Reeves\u2019 counsel had acted unreasonably, including Dr.\nGoff\u00a0\u2019s description of the evaluation he would have conducted,\nDr. Ronan\u2019s warning that her testimony was no substitute for an\nactual intellectual disability assessment, and trial counsel\u2019s\nrepeated representations about the necessity of hiring Dr. Goff to\nconduct such an evaluation.The court held that none of this evidence\nmattered because trial counsel did not testify: \u201c[B]ecause Reeves\nfailed to call his counsel to testify, the record is silent as to\nthe reasons trial counsel .\u00a0.\u00a0. chose not to hire Dr.\nGoff or another neuropsychologist.\u201dIbid. The court treated\nthat fact as \u201cfatal\u201d to Reeves\u2019 claim.Id., at 749. Because\nReeves could not establish the subjective \u201creasoning behind\ncounsel\u2019s actions, the presumption of effectiveness [was]\nsufficient to deny relief.\u201dId., at 751 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted); see alsoM.D.D., ___ So. 3d,\nat ___, 2020 WL 6110694, *8 (explaining that the court denied\nReeves relief \u201cbecause he did not call his trial .\u00a0.\u00a0.\ncounsel to testify\u201d).[4]IIIIn reviewing habeas petitions, \u201cfederal judges\nmust begin with the \u2018presumption that state courts know and follow\nthe law.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAnte, at 8 (quotingWoodfordv.Visciotti,537 U.S.\n19, 24 (2002) (per curiam)). But when state courts\ncontravene this Court\u2019s precedents, federal courts cannot turn a\nblind eye. Here, it is hard to see how the state court could have\nbeen any clearer in applying aper\u00a0serule that\nundisputedly violatesStrickland.AThe Court declares that it is \u201cclear from\ncontext that the Alabama court did not apply a blanket rule, but\nrather determined that the facts of this case did not merit\nrelief.\u201dAnte, at 10. The problem is that the \u201cfacts of this\ncase\u201d make no appearance in the state court\u2019s discussion. SeeReeves, 226 So. 3d, at 749\u2013751. This Court thus searches for\nsome sign (any sign) that the state court implicitly assessed the\nfacts of the case.The Court first points to two statements at the\nbeginning of the state court\u2019s analysis in which it \u201csaid that it\nwould consider \u2018all the circumstances\u2019 of the case.\u201dAnte,\nat 10\u201311. But after perfunctorily citing theStricklandstandard, the state court never actually followed through on its\nobligation to consider the evidence. Its analysis began and ended\nwith counsel\u2019s failure to testify. SeeReeves, 226 So. 3d,\nat 750\u2013751. State courts cannot insulate their decisions from\nscrutiny by quoting the proper standard and then ignoring it.In a similar vein, this Court seizes upon the\nstate court\u2019s quotation from an earlier case stating that trial\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018counsel shouldordinarilybe afforded an opportunity\nto explain his actions before being denounced as\nineffective.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAnte, at 11. This, the Court claims,\n\u201cbelie[s] a categorical approach.\u201dAnte, at 10. The state\ncourt, however, expressly overrode that formulation of the rule,\nstating that the court \u201c[s]ubsequently\u201d held that IAC petitioners\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018must\u2019\u00a0\u201d question trial counsel.Reeves,\n226 So. 3d, at 747\u2013748 (emphasis in original). It relied on that\nrule to reject Reeves\u2019 claim.Id., at 748\u2013749.The Court also cites the length of the state\ncourt\u2019s opinion as purported proof that the court conducted a\nfact-specific inquiry.Ante, at 11. But what matters is the\nstate court\u2019s reasoning, not the length of its opinion. The state\ncourt did not spend \u201calmost nine pages\u201d conducting a detailed\n\u201ccase-specific\u201d analysis.Ibid. The vast majority of the\nstate court\u2019s discussion instead consists of a list of Reeves\u2019 IAC\nallegations and lengthy block quotes of general legal standards.\nSeeReeves, 226 So. 3d, at 744\u2013750. When the court finally\nturned to the facts of this case, it explicitly barred relief only\n\u201cbecause Reeves failed to call his counsel to testify.\u201dId.,\nat 751.Finally, the Court latches on to three words,\n\u201c[i]n this case,\u201d insisting that they prove that the state court\nmerely concluded that trial counsel\u2019s testimony was critical to\nReeves\u2019 IAC claim \u201c[i]n this case.\u201dAnte, at 11 (quoting 226\nSo. 3d, at 749; emphasis deleted). But in using the phrase \u201c[i]n\nthis case,\u201d the state court was not addressing the evidentiary\nrecord. It was analogizing Reeves\u2019 case to the many cases it had\njust cited for the proposition that \u201c\u00a0\u2018a Rule 32 petitioner\nmust, at his evidentiary hearing, question trial counsel regarding\nhis or her actions and reasoning.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId., at\n748\u2013749 (emphasis in original). It then concluded that \u201cReeves\u2019s\nfailure to call his attorneys to testify\u201d in this case was\nsimilarly \u201cfatal to his claims.\u201dId., at 749. If the state\ncourt had meant to weigh the evidence in the record, it would have.\nIt did not. This Court is putting words in the state court\u2019s mouth\nthat the state court never uttered, and which are flatly\ninconsistent with what the state court did say.BFinding no relevant factual analysis in the\nstate court\u2019s decision, this Court attempts its own, speculating as\nto what Reeves\u2019 counsel might have said had they been called to\ntestify. Seeante, at 8\u201310. For instance, the Court imagines\nthat \u201ccounsel may have uncovered additional evidence confirming\ntheir concerns about an intellectual-disability strategy.\u201dAnte, at 9.[5] The Court\nalso insinuates that Reeves may have strategically declined to call\nhis trial counsel to avoid harmful testimony.Ante, at 10.\nBut if counsel\u2019s testimony would have been damaging to Reeves\u2019\nclaim, one would have expected the State to call counsel to\ntestify. Yet the State expressly declined to do so, despite having\ncounsel available to testify. See ECF Doc. 23\u201325, at 85\u201386.The Court\u2019s eagerness to invent scenarios\nharmful to Reeves\u2019 claim stems from its apparent belief that \u201cthe\nAlabama court was entitled to reject Reeves\u2019 claim if trial counsel\nhad any \u2018possible reaso[n] .\u00a0.\u00a0. for proceeding as they\ndid.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAnte, at 10 (quotingCullenv.Pinholster,563 U.S.\n170, 196 (2011)). That view has no basis in this Court\u2019s\nprecedent.Cullendid not hold that an IAC claim fails if a\ncourt can imagine any possible reason for counsel\u2019s actions. No\nclaim could ever survive such a standard. One can always imagine\nsome unsubstantiated reason for what trial counsel did.Culleninstead stated that, to assess whether counsel\u2019s\nconduct was reasonable, courts must \u201centertain the range of\npossible reasons\u201d for counsel\u2019s actions in light of the events and\nevidence actually established in the record.Id., at 196\n(internal quotation marks omitted). The Court\u2019s speculations about\nwhat may have occurred after Dr. Goff\u00a0\u2019s appointment are pure\nconjecture.In any case, the Court\u2019s guesswork is beside the\npoint because it was not the basis for the state court\u2019s decision.\nWhen a state court gives a reasoned explanation for its decision,\nfederal habeas courts must review that decision on its own terms.\nSeeWilsonv.Sellers, 584 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2018)\n(slip op., at 2) (\u201cIn that case, a federal habeas court simply\nreviews the specific reasons given by the state court and defers to\nthose reasons if they are reasonable\u201d). Here, the state court\nrelied solely on the mere fact that Reeves\u2019 counsel did not\ntestify. That is the only reason subject to our review, and it\nplainly contravenesStrickland.Even as the Court attempts to save the state\ncourt\u2019s decision, it erroneously embraces the state court\u2019s flawed\nassumption that IAC claims require direct evidence of the\nsubjective \u201c\u00a0\u2018reasoning behind counsel\u2019s actions.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Seeante, at 11. \u201cStrickland, however, calls for an\ninquiry into the objective reasonableness of counsel\u2019s performance,\nnot counsel\u2019s subjective state of mind.\u201dHarringtonv.Richter,562 U.S.\n86, 110 (2011). \u201cA convicted defendant making a claim of\nineffective assistance must identify the acts or omissions of\ncounsel that are alleged not to have been the result of reasonable\nprofessional judgment. The court must then determine whether, in\nlight of all the circumstances, the identified acts or omissions\nwere outside the wide range of professionally competent\nassistance.\u201dStrickland, 466 U.\u00a0S., at 690. This\ninquiry must be conducted \u201c[e]ven assuming\u201d that counsel acted \u201cfor\nstrategic reasons,\u201dWigginsv.Smith,539 U.S.\n510, 527 (2003), and even if counsel does not testify. Cf.Buck, 580 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 17) (\u201cNo\ncompetent defense attorney would introduce such evidence about his\nown client\u201d). \u201c\u00a0\u2018In any case presenting an ineffectiveness\nclaim, the performance inquiry must be whether counsel\u2019s assistance\nwas reasonable considering all the circumstances.\u2019\u00a0\u201dHintonv.Alabama,571 U.S.\n263, 273 (2014) (per\u00a0curiam). This Court simply\ncannot escape the fact that the state court failed to conduct the\nnecessary inquiry.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*Today\u2019s decision continues a troubling trend\nin which this Court strains to reverse summarily any grants of\nrelief to those facing execution. See,e.g.,United Statesv.Higgs, 592 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2021)\n(emergency vacatur of stay and reversal);Shinnv.Kayer, 592 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2020) (per\u00a0curiam)\n(summary vacatur);Dunnv.Ray, 586 U.\u00a0S. ___\n(2019) (emergency vacatur of stay). This Court has shown no such\ninterest in cases in which defendants seek relief based on\ncompelling showings that their constitutional rights were violated.\nSee,e.g.,Johnsonv.Precythe, 593\nU.\u00a0S. ___ (2021) (denying certiorari);Whatleyv.Warden, 593 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2021) (same);Bernardv.United States, 592 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2020) (same). In Reeves\u2019\ncase, this Court stops the lower court from granting Reeves\u2019\npetition by adopting an utterly implausible reading of the state\ncourt\u2019s decision. In essence, the Court turns \u201cdeference,\u201dante, at 7, into a rule that federal habeas relief is never\navailable to those facing execution. I respectfully dissent.Notes1Reeves\u2019 IQ scores were\neven lower after accounting for the Flynn Effect. ECF Doc. 23\u201324,\nat 43\u201346. Dr. Goff concluded that Reeves\u2019 IQ fell within the\nintellectual disability range even without such an adjustment.Id., at 44, 99.2The state court separately held\nthat relief was not warranted because the court could conceive of a\nsound strategic reason for counsel\u2019s actions and because M.D.D.\nfailed to show prejudice. SeeStatev.M.D.D., ___ So. 3d ___, ___\u2013___, 2020 WL\n6110694, *8\u2013*9 (Ala. Crim. App., Oct. 16, 2020).3As the Eleventh Circuit\nrecognized, this Court has found deficient performance without any\ntestimony from trial counsel. SeeReevesv.Commissioner,Ala.Dept.of\nCorrections, 836 Fed. Appx. 733, 751 (2020)\n(per\u00a0curiam) (discussingBuckv.Davis,\n580 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2017)). This Court has also found deficient\nperformance when counsel testified and \u201cattempt[ed] to justify\ntheir [actions] as reflecting a tactical judgment.\u201dWigginsv.Smith,539 U.S.\n510, 521 (2003).4The Court has no answer to the\nexplicit description inM.D.D.of the state court\u2019s\nreasoning inReeves.Instead, the Court collapses the state\ncourt\u2019s alternative holdings inM.D.D., conflating the state\ncourt\u2019s application of theper\u00a0serule requiring\ncounsel\u2019s testimony with the state court\u2019s separate reasons for\ndenying relief.Ante,at 12, n.\u00a04. It is true, as the\nCourt notes, that the state court \u201cexamin[ed] the evidence and\nidentif[ied] a sound, strategic reason\u201d for counsel\u2019s actions\n\u201cafter citingReevesand quoting thesame languagethat the dissent claims represents aper serule.\u201dIbid.(internal quotation marks omitted). What the Court\nfails to mention is that the state court first concluded that theper\u00a0serule applied inReeveswas sufficient, on\nits own, to deny relief.M.D.D., ___ So. 3d, at ___, 2020 WL\n6110694, *8 (\u201cIn this case, the failure to have trial counsel\ntestify is fatal to M.D.D.\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of\ncounsel,\u201d because \u201cwhere the record is silent as to the reasoning\nbehind counsel\u2019s actions, the presumption of effectiveness is\nsufficient to deny relief\u00a0\u201d (internal quotation marks\nomitted)). Only after announcing this holding did the state court\nseparately offer two additional, independent reasons for denying\nrelief, explaining that \u201c[f]urther,\u201d there was a \u201csound, strategic\nreason\u201d for counsel\u2019s actions, and \u201c[m]ore[o]ver,\u201d an examination\nof the record showed that M.D.D. had failed to demonstrate\nprejudice.Id.,at *8\u2013*9. Contrary to the Court\u2019s\nsuggestion, these alternative holdings formed no part of the state\ncourt\u2019s discussion ofReevesor application of theper\u00a0serule. The Court rewrites yet another state-court\ndecision in service of its efforts to rewrite this\none.5The Court hypothesizes\nthat \u201c[t]he attorneys may very well have pored over the voluminous\nevidence in their possession\u2014including those obtainedaftertheir funding request\u2014and identified several reasons that a jury\nwas unlikely to be persuaded [by] a claim of intellectual\ndisability.\u201dAnte, at 8\u20139 (noting evidence indicating that\nReeves\u2019 \u201cintelligence was below average,\u201d but he was not\nintellectually disabled, and Reeves\u2019 \u201chistory of violence, criminal\npast, and behavior problems\u201d). But counsel already knew of these\nconcerns when they moved for Dr. Goff\u00a0\u2019s appointment. For\ninstance, several months before counsel filed their initial motion,\nthey received a report from Dr. Ronan\u2019s guilt-phase evaluation\ndetailing these issues. See ECF Doc. 23\u201313, at 61\u201363, 65. It is\nhard to see how counsel\u2019s later request for the records underlying\nthat evaluation could have significantly changed their calculus.\nSeeante, at 3; ECF Doc. 23\u20131, at 88. Moreover, even if\ncounsel had discovered additional evidence related to Reeves\u2019\nintellectual disability, there would still be a need for an expert\nto evaluate the evidence in its totality. Indeed, Reeves\u2019 counsel\nargued to the state court that, given the volume of evidence, they\nneeded the assistance of a qualified expert to properly \u201ccompile\u201d\nand \u201ccorrelate\u201d the information and evaluate Reeves.Id., at\n74\u201375; see ECF Doc. 23\u20133, at 91 (counsel arguing that they required\nDr. Goff\u00a0\u2019s assistance because \u201cthe amount of material that we\nhave received through discovery .\u00a0.\u00a0. is beyond our\nability to deal with\u201d).",
