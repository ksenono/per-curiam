S. ____ (2011)SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESNO. 09-1163GLEN SCOTT MILNER, PETITIONERv.DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVYon writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the ninth circuit[March 7, 2011]Justice Kagan delivered the\nopinion of the Court.The Freedom of Information Act\n(FOIA), 5 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7552, requires federal agencies to make\nGovernment records available to the public, subject to nine\nexemptions for specific categories of material. This case concerns\nthe scope of Exemption 2, which protects from disclosure material\nthat is \u201crelated solely to the internal personnel rules and\npractices of an agency.\u201d \u00a7552(b)(2). Respondent Department of the\nNavy (Navy or Government) invoked Exemption 2 to deny a FOIA\nrequest for data and maps used to help store explosives at a naval\nbase in Washington State. We hold that Exemption 2 does not stretch\nso far.ICongress enacted FOIA to overhaul\nthe public-disclosure section of the Administrative Procedure Act\n(APA), 5 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71002 (1964 ed.). That section of the APA\n\u201cwas plagued with vague phrases\u201d and gradually became more \u201ca\nwithholding statute than a disclosure statute.\u201dEPAv.Mink,410 U.\nS. 73, 79 (1973). Congress intended FOIA to \u201cpermit access to\nofficial information long shielded unnecessarily from public view.\u201dId.,at 80. FOIA thus mandates that an agency disclose\nrecords on request, unless they fall within one of nine exemptions.\nThese exemptions are \u201cexplicitly made exclusive,\u201did., at\n79, and mustbe \u201cnarrowly construed,\u201dFBIv.Abramson,456 U. S. 615, 630\n(1982).At issue here is Exemption 2,\nwhich shields from compelled disclosure documents \u201crelated solely\nto the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency.\u201d\n\u00a7552(b)(2). Congress enacted Exemption 2 to replace the APA\u2019s\nexemption for \u201cany matter relating solely to the internal\nmanagement of an agency,\u201d 5 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71002 (1964 ed.).\nBelieving that the \u201csweep\u201d of the phrase \u201cinternal management\u201d had\nled to excessive withholding, Congress drafted Exemption 2 \u201cto have\na narrower reach.\u201dDepartment of Air Forcev.Rose,425\nU. S. 352, 362\u2013363 (1976).We considered the extent of that\nreach inDepartment of Air Forcev.Rose. There,\nwe rejected the Government\u2019s invocation of Exemption 2 to withhold\ncase summaries of honor and ethics hearings at the United States\nAir Force Academy. The exemption, we suggested, primarily targets\nmaterial concerning employee relations or human resources: \u201cuse of\nparking facilities or regulations of lunch hours, statements of\npolicy as to sick leave, and the like.\u201dId.,at 363\n(quoting S.\u00a0Rep. No. 813, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., 8 (1965)\n(hereinafter S.\u00a0Rep.)); seeRose,425 U. S.,at 367. \u201c[T]he general thrust\u201d of Exemption 2, we explained, \u201cis\nsimply to relieve agencies of the burden of assembling and\nmaintaining [such information] for public inspection.\u201dId.,at 369. We concluded that the case summaries did not\nfall within the exemption because they \u201cd[id] not concern only\nroutine matters\u201d of \u201cmerely internal significance.\u201dId.,at 370. But we stated a possible caveat to our interpretation of\nExemption 2: That understanding of the provision\u2019s coverage\ngoverned, we wrote, \u201cat least where the situation is not one where\ndisclosure may risk circumvention of agency regulation.\u201dId.,at 369.InCrookerv.Bureau\nof Alcohol, Tobacco & Firearms, 670 F.\u00a02d 1051\n(1981), the D.\u00a0C. Circuit converted this caveat into a new\ndefinition of Exemption 2\u2019s scope.Crookerapproved the\nuse of Exemption 2 to shield a manual designed to train Government\nagents in law enforcement surveillance techniques. The D. C.\nCircuit noted that it previously had understood Exemption 2 to\n\u201crefe[r] only to \u2018pay, pensions, vacations, hours of work, lunch\nhours, parking, etc.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId.,at 1056 (quotingJordanv.Department of Justice, 591 F.\u00a02d\n753, 763 (1978)). But the court now thought Exemption 2 should also\ncover any \u201cpredominantly internal\u201d materials,[Footnote 1]Crooker, 670 F.\u00a02d, at\n1056\u20131057, whose disclosure would \u201csignificantly ris[k]\ncircumvention of agency regulations or statutes,\u201did.,at\n1074. This construction of Exemption 2, the court reasoned, flowed\nfrom FOIA\u2019s \u201coverall design,\u201d its legislative history, \u201cand even\ncommon sense,\u201d because Congress could not have meant to \u201cenac[t] a\nstatute whose provisions undermined \u2026 the effectiveness of law\nenforcement agencies.\u201dIbid.In the ensuing years, three Courts\nof Appeals adopted the D.\u00a0C. Circuit\u2019s interpretation of\nExemption 2. See 575 F.\u00a03d 959, 965 (CA9 2009) (case below);Masseyv.FBI, 3 F.\u00a03d 620, 622 (CA2 1993);Kaganovev.EPA, 856 F.\u00a02d 884, 889 (CA7\n1988).[Footnote 2] And that\ninterpretation spawned a new terminology: Courts applying theCrookerapproach now refer to the \u201cLow 2\u201d exemption when\ndiscussing materials concerning human resources and employee\nrelations, and to the \u201cHigh 2\u201d exemption when assessing records\nwhose disclosure would risk circumvention of the law. See,e.g.,575 F.\u00a03d, at 963;Schillerv.NLRB, 964 F.\u00a02d 1205, 1208 (CADC 1992). Congress, as\nwell, took notice of the D.\u00a0C. Circuit\u2019s decision, borrowing\nlanguage fromCrookerto amend Exemption 7(E) when next\nenacting revisions to FOIA. The amended version of Exemption 7(E)\nshields certain \u201crecords or information compiled for law\nenforcement purposes\u201d if their disclosure \u201ccould reasonably be\nexpected to risk circumvention of the law.\u201d \u00a7552(b)(7)(E); see\nFreedom of Information Reform Act of 1986, \u00a71802(a), 100 Stat.\n3207\u201349.IIThe FOIA request at\nissue here arises from the Navy\u2019s operations at Naval Magazine\nIndian Island, a base in Puget Sound, Washington. The Navy keeps\nweapons, ammunition, and explosives on the island. To aid in the\nstorage and transport of these munitions, the Navy uses data known\nas Explosive Safety Quantity Distance (ESQD) information. 575\nF.\u00a03d, at 962. ESQD information prescribes \u201cminimum separation\ndistances\u201d for explosives and helps the Navy design and construct\nstorage facilities to prevent chain reactions in case of\ndetonation.Ibid.The ESQD calculations are often\nincorporated into specialized maps depicting the effects of\nhypothetical explosions. See,e.g.,App. 52.In 2003 and 2004, petitioner Glen\nMilner, a Puget Sound resident, submitted FOIA requests for all\nESQD information relating to Indian Island. 575 F.\u00a03d, at 962.\nThe Navy refused to release the data, stating that disclosure would\nthreaten the security of the base and surrounding community. In\nsupport of its decision to withhold the records, the Navy invoked\nExemption 2.Ibid.[Footnote\n3]The District Court granted summary\njudgment to the Navy, and the Court of Appeals affirmed, relying on\nthe High 2 interpretation developed inCrooker. 575\nF.\u00a03d, at 963. The Court of Appeals explained that the ESQD\ninformation \u201cis predominantly used for the internal purpose of\ninstructing agency personnel on how to do their jobs.\u201dId., at 968. And disclosure of the material, the court\ndetermined, \u201cwould risk circumvention of the law\u201d by \u201cpoint[ing]\nout the best targets for those bent on wreaking havoc\u201d\u2014for example,\n\u201c[a] terrorist who wished to hit the most damaging target.\u201dId.,at 971. The ESQD information, the court concluded,\ntherefore qualified for a High 2 exemption. 575 F.\u00a03d, at\n971.We granted certiorari in light of\nthe Circuit split respecting Exemption 2\u2019s meaning, 561 U. S. ___\n(2010), and we now reverse.IIIOur consideration of\nExemption 2\u2019s scope starts with its text. See,e.g., Park \u2019N\nFly, Inc.v.Dollar Park & Fly, Inc.,469 U. S. 189, 194\n(1985) (\u201cStatutory construction must begin with the language\nemployed by Congress and the assumption that the ordinary meaning\nof that language accurately expresses the legislative purpose\u201d).\nJudicial decisions since FOIA\u2019s enactment have analyzed and\nreanalyzed the meaning of the exemption. But comparatively little\nattention has focused on the provision\u2019s 12 simple words: \u201crelated\nsolely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an\nagency.\u201dThe key word in that dozen\u2014the one\nthat most clearly marks the provision\u2019s boundaries\u2014is \u201cpersonnel.\u201d\nWhen used as an adjective, as it is here to modify \u201crules and\npractices,\u201d that term refers to human resources matters.\n\u201cPersonnel,\u201d in this common parlance, means \u201cthe selection,\nplacement, and training of employees and \u2026 the formulation of\npolicies, procedures, and relations with [or involving] employees\nor their representatives.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International\nDictionary 1687 (1966) (hereinafter Webster\u2019s). So, for example, a\n\u201cpersonnel department\u201d is \u201cthe department of a business firm that\ndeals with problems affecting the employees of the firm and that\nusually interviews applicants for jobs.\u201d Random House Dictionary\n1075 (1966) (hereinafter Random House). \u201cPersonnel management\u201d is\nsimilarly \u201cthe phase of management concerned with the engagement\nand effective utilization of manpower to obtain optimum efficiency\nof human resources.\u201d Webster\u2019s 1687. And a \u201cpersonnel agency\u201d is\n\u201can agency for placing employable persons in jobs; employment\nagency.\u201d Random House 1075.FOIA itself provides an additional\nexample in Exemption 6.SeeRatzlafv.United States,510 U. S. 135, 143\n(1994) (\u201cA term appearing in several places in a statutory text is\ngenerally read the same way each time it appears\u201d). That exemption,\njust a few short paragraphs down from Exemption 2, protects from\ndisclosure \u201cpersonnel and medical files and similar files the\ndisclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion\nof personal privacy.\u201d \u00a7552(b)(6). Here too, the statute uses the\nterm \u201cpersonnel\u201d as a modifier meaning \u201chuman resources.\u201d See Tr.\nof Oral Arg. 32 (\u201c[The Court:] It\u2019s [an] H.\u00a0R. file, right?\n[The Government:] That\u2019s generally true\u201d). As we recognized inRose, \u201cthe common and congressional meaning of \u2026\n\u2018personnel file\u2019\u00a0\u201d is the file \u201cshowing, for example, where\n[an employee] was born, the names of his parents, where he has\nlived from time to time, his \u2026 school records, results of\nexaminations, [and] evaluations of his work performance.\u201d 425 U.\nS., at 377. It is the file typically maintained in the human\nresources office\u2014otherwise known (to recall an example offered\nabove) as the \u201cpersonnel department.\u201dIbid.Exemption 2 uses\n\u201cpersonnel\u201d in the exact same way. An agency\u2019s \u201cpersonnel rules and\npractices\u201d are its rules and practices dealing with employee\nrelations or human resources. The D.\u00a0C. Circuit, in a\npre-Crookerdecision, gave as examples \u201cmatters relating\nto pay, pensions, vacations, hours of work, lunch hours, parking,\netc.\u201dJordan, 591 F.\u00a02d, at 763; seesupra,\nat 3. That \u201cetc.\u201d is important; we doubt any court could know\nenough about the Federal Government\u2019s operations to formulate a\ncomprehensive list. But all the rules and practices referenced in\nExemption 2 share a critical feature: They concern the conditions\nof employment in federal agencies\u2014such matters as hiring and\nfiring, work rules and discipline, compensation and\nbenefits.[Footnote 4] Courts in\npractice have had little difficulty identifying the records that\nqualify for withholding under this reading: They are what now\ncommonly fall within the Low 2 exemption. Our construction of the\nstatutory language simply makes clear that Low 2 is all of 2 (and\nthat High 2 is not 2 at all, seeinfra, at\n10\u201314).The statute\u2019s purpose\nreinforces this understanding of the exemption. We have often noted\n\u201cthe Act\u2019s goal of broad disclosure\u201d and insisted that the\nexemptions be \u201cgiven a narrow compass.\u201dDepartment of\nJusticev.Tax Analysts,492 U. S. 136, 151\n(1989); seeDepartment of Interiorv.Klamath Water\nUsers Protective Assn.,532 U. S. 1, 7\u20138\n(2001).[Footnote 5] This\npractice of \u201cconstru[ing] FOIA exemptions narrowly,\u201dDepartment\nof Justicev.Landano,508 U. S. 165, 181\n(1993), stands on especially firm footing with respect to Exemption\n2. As described earlier, Congress worded that provision to hem in\nthe prior APA exemption for \u201cany matter relating solely to the\ninternal management of an agency,\u201d which agencies had used to\nprevent access to masses of documents. SeeRose, 425 U.\nS., at 362. We would ill-serve Congress\u2019s purpose by construing\nExemption 2 to reauthorize the expansive withholding that Congress\nwanted to halt. Our reading instead gives the exemption the\n\u201cnarrower reach\u201d Congress intended,id.,at 363, through\nthe simple device of confining the provision\u2019s meaning to itswords.The\nGovernment resists giving \u201cpersonnel\u201d its plain meaning on the\nground that Congress, when drafting Exemption 2, considered but\nchose not to enact language exempting \u201cinternal employment rules\nand practices.\u201d Brief for Respondent 30\u201334, and n. 11. This\ndrafting history, the Navy maintains, proves that Congress did not\nwish \u201cto limit the Exemption to employment-related matters,\u201did.,at 31, even if the adjective \u201cpersonnel\u201d conveys that\nmeaning in other contexts,id.,at 41. But we think the\nNavy\u2019s evidence insufficient: The scant history concerning this\nword change as easily supports the inference that Congress merely\nswapped one synonym for another. Cf.Mead Corp.v.Tilley,490\nU. S. 714, 723 (1989) (noting with respect to the \u201cunexplained\ndisappearance of one word from an unenacted bill\u201d that \u201cmute\nintermediate legislative maneuvers are not reliable\u201d aids to\nstatutory interpretation (internal quotation marks omitted)). Those\nof us who make use of legislative history believe that clear\nevidence of congressional intent may illuminate ambiguous text. We\nwill not take the opposite tack of allowing ambiguous legislative\nhistory to muddy clear statutory language.Exemption\n2, as we have construed it, does not reach the ESQD information at\nissue here. These data and maps calculate and visually portray the\nmagnitude of hypothetical detonations. By no stretch of imagination\ndo they relate to \u201cpersonnel rules and practices,\u201d as that term is\nmost naturally understood. They concern the physical rules\ngoverning explosives, not the workplace rules governing sailors;\nthey address the handling of dangerous materials, not the treatment\nof employees. The Navy therefore may not use Exemption 2,\ninterpreted in accord with its plain meaning to cover human\nresources matters, to prevent disclosure of the requested maps and\ndata.IVThe Government offers two alternative\nreadings of Exemption 2 to support withholding the ESQD\ninformation. We cannot square either with the\nstatute.AThe Navy first encourages us to adopt the\nconstruction of Exemption 2 pioneered byCrooker, which\nshields material not only if it meets the criteria set out above\n(Low 2), but also if it is \u201cpredominant[ly] interna[l]\u201d and its\n\u201cdisclosure would significantly risk[] circumvention of federal\nagency functions\u201d (High 2). Brief for Respondent 41 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). The dissent, too, favors this reading of\nthe statute.Post, at 1. But theCrookerinterpretation, as already suggested, suffers from a patent flaw:\nIt is disconnected from Exemption 2\u2019s text. The High 2 test (in\naddition to substituting the word \u201cpredominantly\u201d for \u201csolely,\u201d see\nn.\u00a01,supra) ignores the plain meaning of the\nadjective \u201cpersonnel,\u201d seesupra, at 6\u20139, and adopts a\ncircumvention requirement with no basis or referent in Exemption\n2\u2019s language. Indeed, the only way to arrive at High 2 is by taking\na red pen to the statute\u2014\u201ccutting out some\u201d words and \u201cpasting in\nothers\u201d until little of the actual provision remains.Elliottv.Department of Agriculture, 596\nF.\u00a03d 842, 845 (CADC 2010). Because this is so, High 2 is\nbetter labeled \u201cNon 2\u201d (and Low 2 \u2026 just\n2).In support\nof its text-light approach to the statute, the Government relies\nprimarily on legislative history, placing particular emphasis on\nthe House Report concerning FOIA. See Brief for Respondent 33\u201338. A\nstatement in that Report buttresses the High 2 understanding of the\nexemption and, indeed, specifically rejects the Low 2 construction.\nAccording to the Report: \u201cOperating rules, guidelines, and manuals\nof procedure for Government investigators or examiners would be\nexempt from disclosure [under Exemption 2], but this exemption\nwould not cover \u2026 employee relations and working conditions and\nroutine administrative procedures.\u201d H.\u00a0R. Rep. No. 1497, 89th\nCong., 2d Sess., 10 (1966). But the Senate Report says exactly the\nopposite, explaining in support of a Low 2 interpretation that the\nphrase \u201cinternal personnel rules and practices of an agency\u201d means\n\u201crules as to personnel\u2019s use of parking facilities or regulation of\nlunch hours, statements of policy as to sick leave, and the like.\u201d\nS.\u00a0Rep., at\u00a08.[Footnote\n6] InRose, we gave reasons for thinking the Senate\nReport the more reliable of the two. See 425 U. S., at 366. But the\nmore fundamental point is what we said before: Legislative history,\nfor those who take it into account, is meant to clear up ambiguity,\nnot create it. Seesupra, at 9;Wong Yang Sungv.McGrath,339\nU. S. 33, 49 (1950) (declining to consult legislative history\nwhen that \u201chistory is more conflicting than the text is\nambiguous\u201d). When presented, on the one hand, with clear statutory\nlanguage and, on the other, with dueling committee reports, we must\nchoose the language.The\nGovernment also advances, in support ofCrooker\u2019s High 2\napproach, an argument based on subsequent legislative action.\nCongress, the Government notes, amended Exemption 7(E) in 1986 to\ncover law enforcement records whose production \u201cwould disclose\ntechniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations or\nprosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement\ninvestigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reason-ably\nbe expected to risk circumvention of the law.\u201d \u00a7552(b)(7)(E). That\namendment, the Government contends, codifiedCrooker\u2019s\n\u201ccircumvention of the law\u201d standard and, in so doing, ratifiedCrooker\u2019s holding. Brief for Respondent 42\u201343. The dissent\nlikewise counts as significant that Congress \u201ct[ook] note\u201d ofCrookerin revising FOIA.Post, at 9; seepost, at 2.But the\nGovernment and the dissent neglect the key feature of the 1986\namendment: Congress modified not Exemption 2 (the subject ofCrooker), but instead Exemption 7(E). And theCrookerconstruction of Exemption 2 renders Exemption 7(E)\nsuperfluous and so deprives that amendment of any effect. See,e.g., TRW Inc.v.Andrews,534 U. S. 19, 31 (2001)\n(noting canon that statutes should be read to avoid making any\nprovision \u201csuperfluous, void, or insignificant\u201d (internal quotation\nmarks omitted)). We cannot think of any document eligible for\nwithholding under Exemption 7(E) that the High 2 reading does not\ncapture: The circumvention standard is the same, and the law\nenforcement records listed in Exemption 7(E) are \u201cpredominantly\ninternal.\u201d So if Congress had agreed withCrooker\u2019s\nreading of Exemption 2, it would have had no reason to alter\nExemption 7(E). In that event, Congress would either have left the\nstatute alone (on the theory thatCrookerwould do the\nnecessary work) or would have amended Exemption 2 specifically to\nratifyCrooker. The decision instead to amend Exemption\n7(E) suggests that Congress approved the circumvention standard\nonly as to law enforcement materials, and not as to the wider set\nof records High 2 covers. Perhaps this legislative action does not\nshow that Congress affirmatively disagreed withCrooker;maybe Congress was agnostic about whether the circumvention\nstandard should apply to other records. But one thing is clear: The\n1986 amendment does not ratify, approve, or otherwise signal\nagreement withCrooker\u2019s interpretation of Exemption 2.\nThis argument therefore cannot save the High 2\nconstruction.The\ndissent offers one last reason to embrace High 2, and indeed stakes\nmost of its wager on this argument.Crooker, the dissent\nasserts, \u201chas been consistently relied upon and followed for 30\nyears\u201d by other lower courts.Post, at 9; seepost, at 1\u20132. But this claim, too, trips at the starting\ngate. It would be immaterial even if true, because we have no\nwarrant to ignore clear statutory language on the ground that other\ncourts have done so. And in any event, it is not true. Prior toCrooker, three Circuits adopted the reading of Exemption 2\nwe think right, and they have not changed their minds. See\nn.\u00a02,supra.[Footnote\n7] SinceCrooker, three other Circuits have accepted\nthe High 2 reading. Seesupra, at 3. One Circuit has\nreserved judgment on the High 2-Low 2 debate. SeeAudubon\nSocietyv.Forest Serv., 104 F.\u00a03d 1201,\n1203\u20131204 (CA10 1997). And the rest have not considered the matter.\n(No one should thinkCrookerhas been extensively\ndiscussed or debated in the Courts of Appeals. In the past three\ndecades,Crooker\u2019s analysis of Exemption 2 has been cited\na sum total of five times in federal appellate decisions outside\nthe D.\u00a0C. Circuit\u2014on average, once every six years.) The\nresult is a 4 to 3 split among the Circuits.[Footnote 8] We will not flout all usual rules of\nstatutory interpretation to take the side of the bare\nmajority.BPresumably becauseCrookerso\ndeparts from Exemption 2\u2019s language, the Government also offers\nanother construction, which it says we might adopt \u201con a clean\nslate,\u201d \u201cbased on the plain text \u2026 alone.\u201d Brief for Respondent 15.\nOn this reading, the exemption \u201cencompasses records concerning an\nagency\u2019s internal rules and practices for its personnel to follow\nin the discharge of their governmental functions.\u201dId.,at\n20; see alsoid., at 13\u201314 (Exemption 2 \u201capplies generally\nto matters concerning internal rules and practices to guide agency\npersonnel in performing their duties\u201d). According to the\nGovernment, this interpretation makes sense because \u201cthe phrase\n\u2018personnel rules and practices of an agency\u2019 is logically\nunderstood to mean an agency\u2019s rules and practicesfor its\npersonnel.\u201dId.,at 20 (emphasis\nadded).But the\npurported logic in the Government\u2019s definition eludes us. We would\nnot say, in ordinary parlance, that a \u201cpersonnel file\u201d is any file\nan employee uses, or that a \u201cpersonnel department\u201d is any\ndepartment in which an employee serves. No more would we say that a\n\u201cpersonnel rule or practice\u201d is any rule or practice that assists\nan employee in doing her job. The use of the term \u201cpersonnel\u201d in\neach of these phrases connotes not that the file or department or\npractice/rule isforpersonnel, but rather that the file\nor department or practice/rule isaboutpersonnel\u2014i.e., that it relates to employee relations or\nhuman resources. This case well illustrates the point. The records\nrequested, as earlier noted, are explosives data and maps showing\nthe distances that potential blasts travel. This information no\ndoubt assists Navy personnel in storing munitions. But that is not\nto say that the data and maps relate to \u201cpersonnel rules and\npractices.\u201d No one staring at these charts of explosions and using\nordinary language would describe them in this\nmanner.Indeed,\nthe Government\u2019s \u201cclean slate\u201d construction reaches such documents\nonly by stripping the word \u201cpersonnel\u201d of any real meaning. Under\nthis interpretation, an agency\u2019s \u201cinternal personnel rules and\npractices\u201d appears to mean all its internal rules and practices.\nThat is because agencies necessarily operate through personnel, and\nso all their internal rules and practices are for personnel. The\nmodifier \u201cpersonnel,\u201d then, does no modifying work; it does not\nlimit the class of internal rules and practices that Exemption 2\ncovers. What is most naturally viewed as the provision\u2019s key\nword\u2014the term that ought to define its scope\u2014does nothing more than\nstate the truism that in an agency it is \u201cpersonnel\u201d who follow\ninternal rules and practices.And this\nodd reading would produce a sweeping exemption, posing the risk\nthat FOIA would become less a disclosure than \u201ca withholding\nstatute.\u201dMink, 410 U. S., at 79. Many documents an agency\ngenerates in some way aid employees in carrying out their\nresponsibilities. If Exemption 2 were to reach all these records,\nit would tend to engulf other FOIA exemptions, rendering\nineffective the limitations Congress placed on their application.\nExemption 7, for example, shields records compiled for law\nenforcement purposes, but only if one of six specified criteria is\nmet. \u00a7552(b)(7). Yet on the Government\u2019s view, an agency could\nbypass these restrictions by invoking Exemption 2 whenever law\nenforcement records guide personnel in performing their duties.\nIndeed, an agency could use Exemption 2 as an all-purpose back-up\nprovision to withhold sensitive records that do not fall within any\nof FOIA\u2019s more targeted exemptions.[Footnote 9]Interpreted in this way, Exemption 2\u2014call it\n\u201cSuper 2\u201d now\u2014would extend, rather than narrow, the APA\u2019s former\nexemption for records relating to the \u201cinternal management of an\nagency.\u201d 5 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71002 (1964 ed.). We doubt that even the\n\u201cinternal management\u201d provision, which Congress thought allowed too\nmuch withholding, seesupra, at 2, would have protected\nall information that guides employees in the discharge of their\nduties, including the explosives data and maps in this case. And\nperhaps needless to say, this reading of Exemption 2 violates the\nrule favoring narrow construction of FOIA exemptions. See,e.g., Abramson, 456 U. S., at 630;Rose, 425 U.\nS., at 361. Super 2 in fact has no basis in the text, context, or\npurpose of FOIA, and we accordingly reject\nit.VAlthough we cannot interpret Exemption 2 as\nthe Government proposes, we recognize the strength of the Navy\u2019s\ninterest in protecting the ESQD data and maps and other similar\ninformation. The Government has informed us that \u201c[p]ublicly\ndisclosing the [ESQD] information would significantly risk\nundermining the Navy\u2019s ability to safely and securely store\nmilitary ordnance,\u201d Brief for Respondent 47, and we have no reason\nto doubt that representation. The Ninth Circuit similarly cautioned\nthat disclosure of this information could be used to \u201cwrea[k]\nhavoc\u201d and \u201cmake catastrophe more likely.\u201d 575 F.\u00a03d, at 971.\nConcerns of this kind\u2014a sense that certain sensitive informationshouldbe exempt from disclosure\u2014in part led theCrookercourt to formulate the High 2 standard. See 670\nF.\u00a02d, at 1074 (contending that \u201ccommon sense\u201d supported the\nHigh 2 interpretation because Congress would not have wanted FOIA\nto \u201cundermin[e] \u2026 the effectiveness of law enforcement agencies\u201d).\nAnd we acknowledge that our decision today upsets three decades of\nagency practice relying onCrooker, and therefore may\nforce considerable adjustments.We also\nnote, however, that the Government has other tools at hand to\nshield national security information and other sensitive materials.\nMost notably, Exemption 1 of FOIA prevents access to classified\ndocuments. \u00a7552(b)(1); see 575 F.\u00a03d, at 980 (W. Fletcher, J.,\ndissenting) (Exemption 1 is \u201cspecifically designed to allow\ngovernment agencies to withhold information that might jeopardize\nour national security\u201d). The Government generally may classify\nmaterial even after receiving a FOIA request, see Exec. Order No.\n13526, \u00a71.7(d), 75 Fed. Reg. 711 (2009); an agency therefore may\nwait until that time to decide whether the dangers of disclosure\noutweigh the costs of classification. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 29\u201330.\nExemption 3 also may mitigate the Government\u2019s security concerns.\nThat provision applies to records that any other statute exempts\nfrom disclosure, \u00a7552(b)(3), thus offering Congress an established,\nstreamlined method to authorize the withholding of specific records\nthat FOIA would not otherwise protect. And Exemption 7, as already\nnoted, protects \u201cinformation compiled for law enforcement purposes\u201d\nthat meets one of six criteria, including if its release \u201ccould\nreasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical safety of\nany individual.\u201d \u00a7552(b)(7)(F). The Navy argued below that the ESQD\ndata and maps fall within Exemption 7(F), see n.\u00a03,supra, and that claim remains open for the Ninth Circuit\nto address on remand.If these\nor other exemptions do not cover records whose release would\nthreaten the Nation\u2019s vital interests, the Government may of course\nseek relief from Congress. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 48. All we hold\ntoday is that Congress has not enacted the FOIA exemption the\nGovernment desires. We leave to Congress, as is appropriate, the\nquestion whether it should do so.VIExemption 2, consistent with the plain\nmeaning of the term \u201cpersonnel rules and practices,\u201d encompasses\nonly records relating to issues of employee relations and human\nresources. The explosives maps and data requested here do not\nqualify for withholding under that exemption. We therefore reverse\nthe judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for\nfurther proceedings consistent with this\nopinion.It is so\nordered.Footnote 1The court\nadopted the \u201cpredominantly internal\u201d standard as a way of\nimplementing the exemption\u2019s requirement that materials \u201crelat[e]\nsolely to\u201d an agency\u2019s internal personnel rules and practices. The\nword \u201csolely,\u201d the court reasoned, \u201chas to be given the\nconstruction, consonant with reasonableness, of\n\u2018predominantly\u2019\u00a0\u201d because otherwise \u201csolely\u201d would conflict\nwith the expansive term \u201crelated.\u201d 670 F.\u00a02d, at 1056 (some\ninternal quotation marks omitted).Footnote 2Three\nother Courts of Appeals had previously taken a narrower view of\nExemption 2\u2019s scope, consistent with the interpretation adopted inRose. SeeCoxv.Department of Justice,\n576 F.\u00a02d 1302, 1309\u20131310 (CA8 1978) (concluding that\nExemption 2 covers only an agency\u2019s internal \u201chousekeeping matters\u201d\n(internal quotation marks omitted));Stokesv.Brennan, 476 F.\u00a02d 699, 703 (CA5 1973) (holding that\nExemption 2 \u201cmust not be read so broadly as to exempt\u201d an\nOccupational Safety and Health Administration manual for training\ncompliance officers);Hawkesv.IRS, 467\nF.\u00a02d 787, 797 (CA6 1972) (\u201c[T]he internal practices and\npolicies referred to in [Exemption 2] relate only to \u2026\nemployee-employer type concerns\u201d). These Circuits have never\nrevised their understandings of the exemption. Seeinfra,\nat 13, n.\u00a07.Footnote 3The Navy\nalso invoked Exemption 7(F), which applies to \u201crecords or\ninformation compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only to the\nextent that the production of such \u2026 records \u2026 could reasonably be\nexpected to endanger the life or physical safety of any\nindividual.\u201d 5 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7552(b)(7)(F). The courts below did\nnot decide whether the Navy could withhold the ESQD data under that\nexemption. 575 F.\u00a03d 959, 971, n.\u00a08 (CA9 2009); No.\nCV\u201306\u201301301 (WD Wash., Oct. 30, 2007), App. to Pet. for Cert. 4,\n25, 2007 WL 3228049, *8.Footnote 4Government records also must satisfy the other\nrequirements of Exemption 2 to be exempt from disclosure.\nInformation must \u201crelat[e] solely\u201d\u2014meaning, as usual, \u201cexclusively\nor only,\u201d Random House 1354 \u2014to the agency\u2019s \u201cpersonnel rules and\npractices.\u201d And the information must be \u201cinternal\u201d; that is, the\nagency must typically keep the records to itself for its own use.\nSee Webster\u2019s 1180 (\u201cinternal\u201d means \u201cexisting or situated within\nthe limits \u2026 of something\u201d). An agency\u2019s human resources documents\nwill often meet these conditions.Footnote 5The\ndissent would reject this longstanding rule of construction in\nfavor of an approach asking courts \u201cto turn Congress\u2019 public\ninformation objectives into workable agency practice.\u201dPost, at 8\u20139 (opinion of Breyer, J.). But nothing in FOIA\neither explicitly or implicitly grants courts discretion to expand\n(or contract) an exemption on this basis. In enacting FOIA,\nCongress struck the balance it thought right\u2014generally favoring\ndisclosure, subject only to a handful of specified exemptions\u2014and\ndid so across the length and breadth of the Federal Government.\nSee,e.g.,John Doe Agencyv.John Doe\nCorp.,493 U.\nS. 146, 152\u2013153 (1989). The judicial role is to enforce that\ncongressionally determined balance rather than, as the dissent\nsuggests,post, at 4\u20136, to assess case by case, department\nby department, and task by task whether disclosure interferes with\ngood government.Footnote 6We are\nperplexed that the dissent takes seriouslyCrooker\u2019s\nnotion that the reports are \u201creconcilable.\u201dPost,at 4. To\nstrip the matter to its essentials, the House Report says:\n\u201cExemption 2 means A, but not B.\u201d The Senate Report says:\n\u201cExemption 2 means B.\u201d That is the very definition of\n\u201cirreconcilable.\u201dFootnote 7The\ndissent\u2019s view that \u201ctwo of th[ese] Circuits [have] not adher[ed]\nto their early positions\u201d is incorrect.Post, at 2. InAbraham & Rose, P.L.C.v.United States,\ncited by the dissent, the Sixth Circuit rejected the Government\u2019s\nclaim that Exemption 2 shielded records of federal tax lien\nfilings. 138 F.\u00a03d 1075, 1082 (1998). The court nowhere\ndiscussed the High 2 versus Low 2 question at issue here. Its only\nreference toCrookerconcerned the part of that decision\ninterpreting \u201csolely\u201d to mean \u201cpredominantly.\u201d See 138\nF.3d,at 1080; see also n.\u00a01,supra.\nSubsequently, the Sixth Circuit once again held, inRugierov.Department of Justice, that Exemption\n2 applies to \u201croutine matters of merely internal significance.\u201d 257\nF.\u00a03d 534, 549 (2001). InSladekv.Bensinger, which the dissent also cites, the Fifth Circuit\ninsisted that the Government disclose a Drug Enforcement\nAdministration agent\u2019s manual because it \u201cis not the type of\ntrivial rule, such as allocation of parking facilities, that is\ncovered by Exemption 2.\u201d 605 F.\u00a02d 899, 902 (1979). In\nconfirming this Low 2 interpretation of the statute, the court\nacknowledged that another Circuit had embraced the High 2 standard.\nThe court, however, declined to consider this alternative\ninterpretation because it would not have changed the case\u2019s\noutcome. Seeibid.Finally, the Eighth Circuit\u2019s last word\non Exemption 2 is clear, and the dissent does not say otherwise.\nThe exemption, according to that most recent Eighth Circuit\ndecision, applies \u201conly [to an agency\u2019s] housekeeping matters.\u201dCox, 576 F.\u00a02d, at 1309\u20131310 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). The dissent is surely right to say,postat 2, thatCrooker\u201chas guided nearly every FOIA case\ndecided over the last 30 years\u201d in Circuits applyingCrooker; but that statement does not hold in the Circuits\nusing the Low 2 approach.Footnote 8Notably,\neven those courts approvingCrookerhave disagreed about\nhow to apply High 2. Fault lines include whether the risk of\ncircumvention must be significant, see,e.g., Hidalgov.FBI, 541 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d 250, 253 (DC 2008); Pet. for\nCert. 15\u201316; whether courts should consider the public interest in\ndisclosure when calculating that risk, see,e.g.,Department of Justice, Guide to the Freedom of Information Act,\np.\u00a0185 (2009); and whether an agency must regulate the person\nor entity threatening circumvention; compare,e.g.,575\nF.\u00a03d, at 971, with,e.g., id.,at 978 (W. Fletcher,\nJ., dissenting). The disagreement is not surprising. Because High 2\nis nowhere evident in the statute, courts lack the normal\nguideposts for ascertaining its coverage.Footnote 9The\ndissent asserts that \u201c30 years of experience\u201d with a more expansive\ninterpretation of the exemption suggests no \u201cseriou[s]\ninterfere[nce] with \u2026 FOIA\u2019s informational objectives.\u201dPost, at 6. But those objectives suffer any time an agency\ndenies a FOIA request based on an improper interpretation of the\nstatute. To give just one example, the U. S. Forest Service has\nwrongly invoked Exemption 2 on multiple occasions to withhold\ninformation about (of all things) bird nesting sites. SeeAudubon Societyv.Forest Serv., 104 F.\u00a03d\n1201, 1203 (CA10 1997); Maricopa Audubon Soc.v.Forest Serv., 108 F.\u00a03d 1082, 1084 (CA9 1997). And\nrecent statistics raise a concern that federal agencies may too\nreadily use Exemption 2 to refuse disclosure. According toamicusPublic Citizen, \u201cwhile reliance on exemptions\noverall rose 83% from 1998 to 2006, reliance on Exemption 2 rose\n344% during that same time period.\u201d Brief for Public Citizen\net\u00a0al. asAmici Curiae24. In 2009 alone, federal\ndepartments cited Exemption 2 more than 72,000 times to prevent\naccess to records. See Brief for Allied Daily Newspapers of\nWashington et\u00a0al. asAmici Curiae3. We do not doubt\nthat many of these FOIA denials were appropriate. But we are unable\nto accept the dissent\u2019s unsupported declaration that a sweeping\nconstruction of Exemption 2 has not interfered with Congress\u2019s goal\nof broad disclosure.",
