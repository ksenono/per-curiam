A.,\net\u00a0al., PETITIONERS08\u20131119v.UNITED STATESUNITED STATES, PETITIONER08\u20131225\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0v.MILAVETZ, GALLOP & MILAVETZ, P. A.,\net\u00a0al.on writs of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the eighth circuit[March 8, 2010]Justice Sotomayordelivered the opinion of the Court.Congress enacted the Bankruptcy\nAbuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 (BAPCPA or\nAct) to correct perceived abuses of the bankruptcy system. Among\nthe reform measures the Act implemented are a number of provisions\nthat regulate the conduct of \u201cdebt relief\nagenc[ies]\u201d\u2014i.e., professionals who provide bankruptcy\nassistance to consumer debtors. See 11 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a7101(3),\n(12A). These consolidated cases present the threshold question\nwhether attorneys are debt relief agencies when they provide\nqualifying services. Because we agree with the Court of Appeals\nthat they are, we must also consider whether the Act\u2019s provisions\ngoverning debt relief agencies\u2019 advice to clients, \u00a7526(a)(4), and\nrequiring them to make certain disclosures in their advertisements,\n\u00a7\u00a7528(a) and (b)(2), violate the First Amendment rights of\nattorneys. Concluding that the Court of Appeals construed\n\u00a7526(a)(4) too expansively, we reverse its judgment that the\nprovision is unconstitutionally overbroad. Like the Court of\nAppeals, we uphold \u00a7528\u2019s disclosure requirements as applied in\nthese consolidated cases.IIn order to improve bankruptcy\nlaw and practice, Congress enacted through the BAPCPA a number of\nprovisions directed at the conduct of bankruptcy professionals.\nSome of these measures apply to the broad class of bankruptcy\nprofessionals termed \u201cdebt relief agenc[ies].\u201d That category\nincludes, with limited exceptions, \u201cany person who provides any\nbankruptcy assistance to an assisted person in return for \u2026 payment\n\u2026\u00a0, or who is a bankruptcy petition preparer.\u201d\n\u00a7101(12A).[Footnote 1]\n\u201cBankruptcy assistance\u201d refers to goods or services \u201cprovided to an\nassisted person with the express or implied purpose of providing\ninformation, advice, counsel, document preparation, or filing, or\nattendance at a creditors\u2019 meeting or appearing in a case or\nproceeding on behalf of another or providing legal representation\nwith respect to a case or proceeding\u201d in bankruptcy. \u00a7101(4A). An\n\u201cassisted person\u201d is someone with limited nonexempt property whose\ndebts consist primarily of consumer debts. \u00a7101(3). The BAPCPA\nsubjects debt relief agencies to a number of restrictions and\nrequirements, as set forth in \u00a7\u00a7526, 527, and 528. As relevant\nhere, \u00a7526(a) establishes several rules of professional conduct for\npersons qualifying as debt relief agencies. Among them, \u00a7526(a)(4)\nstates that a debt relief agency shall not \u201cadvise an assisted\nperson \u2026 to incur more debt in contemplation of such person filing\na case under this title or to pay an attorney or bankruptcy\npetition preparer fee or charge for services performed as part of\npreparing for or representing a debtor in a case under this\ntitle.\u201dSection 528 requires qualifying professionals\nto include certain disclosures in their advertisements. Subsection\n(a) provides that debt relief agencies must \u201cclearly and\nconspicuously disclose in any advertisement of bankruptcy\nassistance services or of the benefits of bankruptcy directed to\nthe general public\u00a0\u2026 that the services or benefits are with\nrespect to bankruptcy relief under this title.\u201d \u00a7528(a)(3). It also\nrequires them to include the following, \u201cor a substantially similar\nstatement\u201d: \u201cWe are a debt relief agency. We help people file for\nbankruptcy relief under the Bankruptcy Code.\u201d \u00a7528(a)(4).\nSubsection (b) requires essentially the same disclosures in\nadvertisements \u201cindicating that the debt relief agency provides\nassistance with respect to credit defaults, mortgage foreclosures,\neviction proceedings, excessive debt, debt collection pressure, or\ninability to pay any consumer debt.\u201d \u00a7528(b)(2). Debt relief\nagencies advertising such services must disclose \u201cthat the\nassistance may involve bankruptcy relief,\u201d \u00a7528(b)(2)(A), and must\nidentify themselves as \u201cdebt relief agenc[ies]\u201d as required by\n\u00a7528(a)(4), see \u00a7528(b)(2)(B).IIThe plaintiffs in this\nlitigation\u2014the law firm Milavetz, Gallop & Milavetz,\nP.\u00a0A.; the firm\u2019s president, Robert J. Milavetz; a bankruptcy\nattorney at the firm, Barbara Nilva Nevin; and two of the firm\u2019s\nclients (collectively Milavetz)\u2014filed a preenforcement suit in\nFederal District Court seeking declaratory relief with respect to\nthe Act\u2019s debt-relief-agency provisions. Milavetz asked the court\nto hold that it is not bound by these provisions and thus may\nfreely advise clients to incur additional debt and need not\nidentify itself as a debt relief agency in its advertisements.Milavetz first argued that\nattorneys are not \u201cdebt relief agenc[ies]\u201d as that term is used in\nthe BAPCPA. In the alternative, Milavetz sought a judgment that\n\u00a7\u00a7526(a)(4) and 528(a)(4) and (b)(2) are unconstitutional as\napplied to attorneys. The District Court agreed with Milavetz that\nthe term \u201cdebt relief agency\u201d does not include attorneys, App. to\nPet. for Cert. in No. 08\u20131119, p.\u00a0A\u201315, but only after finding\nthat \u00a7\u00a7526 and 528\u2014provisions expressly applicable only to debt\nrelief agencies\u2014are unconstitutional as applied to this class of\nprofessionals.The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit\naffirmed in part and reversed in part. 541 F.\u00a03d 785 (2008).\nRelying on the Act\u2019s plain language, the court unanimously rejected\nthe District Court\u2019s conclusion that attorneys are not \u201cdebt relief\nagenc[ies]\u201d within the meaning of the Act. The Court of Appeals\nalso parted ways with the District Court concerning the\nconstitutionality of \u00a7528. Concluding that the disclosures are\nintended to prevent consumer deception and are \u201creasonably related\u201d\nto that interest, the court upheld the application of \u00a7528\u2019s\ndisclosure requirements to attorneys.Id., at 796\u2013797\n(citingZaudererv.Office of Disciplinary Counsel of\nSupreme Court of Ohio,471 U. S. 626, 651\n(1985)).A majority of the Eighth Circuit panel,\nhowever, agreed with the District Court that \u00a7526(a)(4) is invalid.\nDetermining that \u00a7526(a)(4) \u201cbroadly prohibits a debt relief agency\nfrom advising an assisted person \u2026 to incuranyadditional\ndebt when the assisted person is contemplating bankruptcy,\u201d even\nwhen that advice constitutes prudent prebankruptcy planning not\nintended to abuse the bankruptcy laws, 541 F.\u00a03d, at 793, the\nmajority held that \u00a7526(a)(4) could not withstand either strict or\nintermediate scrutiny. In dissent, Judge Colloton argued that\n\u00a7526(a)(4) should be read narrowly to prevent only advice to abuse\nthe bankruptcy system, noting that this construction would avoid\nmost constitutional difficulties. Seeid., at 799 (opinion\nconcurring in part and dissenting in part).In light of a conflict among the Courts of\nAppeals,[Footnote 2] we granted\ncertiorari to resolve the question of \u00a7526(a)(4)\u2019s scope. 556 U. S.\n___ (2009). We also agreed to consider the threshold question\nwhether attorneys who provide bankruptcy assistance to assisted\npersons are \u201cdebt relief agenc[ies]\u201d within the meaning of\n\u00a7101(12A) and the related question whether \u00a7528\u2019s disclosure\nrequirements are constitutional.IIIAWe first consider whether the\nterm \u201cdebt relief agency\u201d includes attorneys. If it does not, we\nneed not reach the other questions presented, as \u00a7\u00a7526 and 528\ngovern only the conduct of debt relief agencies, and Milavetz\nchallenges the validity of those provisions based on their\napplication to attorneys. The Government contends that \u201cdebt relief\nagency\u201d plainly includes attorneys, while Milavetz urges that it\ndoes not. We conclude that the Government has the better view.As already noted, a debt relief\nagency is \u201cany person who provides any bankruptcy assistance to an\nassisted person\u201d in return for payment. \u00a7101(12A). By definition,\n\u201cbankruptcy assistance\u201d includes several services commonly\nperformed by attorneys. Indeed, some forms of bankruptcy\nassistance, including the \u201cprovi[sion of] legal representation with\nrespect to a case or proceeding,\u201d \u00a7101(4A), may be provided only by\nattorneys. See \u00a7110(e)(2) (prohibiting bankruptcy petition\npreparers from providing legal advice). Moreover, in enumerating\nspecific exceptions to the definition of debt relief agency,\nCongress gave no indication that it intended to exclude attorneys.\nSee \u00a7\u00a7101(12A)(A)\u2013(E). Thus, as the Government contends, the\nstatutory text clearly indicates that attorneys are debt relief\nagencies when they provide qualifying services to assisted\npersons.[Footnote 3]In advocating a narrower understanding of that\nterm, Milavetz relies heavily on the fact that \u00a7101(12A) does not\nexpressly include attorneys. That omission stands in contrast, it\nargues, to the provision\u2019s explicit inclusion of \u201cbankruptcy\npetition preparer[s]\u201d\u2014a category of professionals that excludes\nattorneys and their staff, see \u00a7110(a)(1). But Milavetz does not\ncontend, nor could it credibly, that only professionals expressly\nincluded in the definition are debt relief agencies. On that\nreading, no professional other than a bankruptcy petition preparer\nwould qualify\u2014an implausible reading given that the statute defines\n\u201cdebt relief agency\u201d as \u201cany person who provides any bankruptcy\nassistance to an assisted person \u2026orwho is a bankruptcy\npetition preparer.\u201d \u00a7101(12A) (emphasis added). The provision\u2019s\nsilence regarding attorneys thus avails Milavetz little. Cf.Heintzv.Jenkins,514 U. S. 291, 294\n(1995) (holding that \u201cdebt collector\u201d as used in the Fair Debt\nCollection Practices Act, 15 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71692a(6), includes\nattorneys notwithstanding the definition\u2019s lack of an express\nreference to lawyers or litigation).Milavetz\u2019s other arguments for excluding\nattorneys similarly fail to persuade us to disregard the statute\u2019s\nplain language. Milavetz contends that 11 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7526(d)(2)\u2019s instruction that \u00a7\u00a7526, 527, and 528 should not \u201cbe\ndeemed to limit or curtail\u201d States\u2019 authority to \u201cdetermine and\nenforce qualifications for the practice of law\u201d counsels against\nreading \u201cdebt relief agency\u201d to include attorneys, as the surest\nway to protect the States\u2019 role in regulating the legal profession\nis to make the BAPCPA\u2019s professional conduct rules inapplicable to\nlawyers. We find that \u00a7526(d)(2) supports the opposite conclusion,\nas Congress would have had no reason to enact that provision if the\ndebt-relief-agency provisions did not apply to attorneys.\nMilavetz\u2019s broader claim that reading \u00a7101(12A) to include\nattorneys impermissibly trenches on an area of traditional state\nregulation also lacks merit. Congress and the bankruptcy courts\nhave long overseen aspects of attorney conduct in this area of\nsubstantial federal concern. See,e.g.,Conrad, Rubin\n& Lesserv.Pender,289 U. S. 472, 477\u2013479 (1933) (finding\nbroad authorization in former \u00a796(d) (1934 ed.) (repealed 1978) for\ncourts to examine the reasonableness of a debtor\u2019s prepetition\nattorney\u2019s fees).Milavetz next argues that \u00a7101(12A)\u2019s\nexception for any \u201cofficer, director, employee, or agent of a\nperson who provides\u201d bankruptcy assistance is revealing for its\nfailure to include \u201cpartners.\u201d \u00a7101(12A)(A). In light of that\nomission, it contends, treating attorneys as debt relief agencies\nwill obligate entire law firms to comply with \u00a7\u00a7526, 527, and 528\nbased on the conduct of a single partner, while the agents and\nemployees of debt relief agencies not typically organized as\npartnerships are shielded from those requirements. Given that the\npartnership structure is not unique to law firms, however, it is\nunclear why the exclusion would be revealing of Congress\u2019 intent\nonly with respect to attorneys. In any event, partnerships are\nthemselves \u201cperson[s]\u201d under the BAPCPA, see \u00a7101(41), and can\nqualify as \u201cdebt relief agenc[ies]\u201d when they meet the criteria set\nforth in \u00a7101(12A). Moreover, a partnership\u2019s employees and agents\nare exempted from \u00a7101(12A) in the same way as the employees and\nagents of other organizations. To the extent that partners may be\nsubject to the debt-relief-agency provisions by association, that\nresult is consistent with the joint responsibilities that typically\nflow from the partnership structure, cf.Strangv.Bradner,114 U. S. 555, 561\n(1885).Accordingly, we decline to attribute the\nsignificance Milavetz suggests to \u00a7101(12A)(A)\u2019s failure to include\npartners among the exempted actors.[Footnote 4]All else failing, Milavetz urges\nthat the canon of constitutional avoidance requires us to read\n\u201cdebt relief agency\u201d to exclude attorneys in order to forestall\nserious doubts as to the validity of \u00a7\u00a7526 and 528. The avoidance\ncanon, however, \u201cis a tool for choosing between competing plausible\ninterpretations of a statutory text.\u201dClarkv.Martinez,543 U. S. 371, 381\n(2005). In applying that tool, we will consider only those\nconstructions of a statute that are \u201c\u00a0\u2018fairly\npossible.\u2019\u00a0\u201dUnited Statesv.Security Industrial\nBank,459 U. S.\n70, 78 (1982). For the reasons already discussed, the text and\nstatutory context of \u00a7101(12A) foreclose a reading of \u201cdebt relief\nagency\u201d that excludes attorneys. Accordingly, we hold that\nattorneys who provide bankruptcy assistance to assisted persons are\ndebt relief agencies within the meaning of the BAPCPA.BHaving concluded that\nattorneys are debt relief agencies when they provide qualifying\nservices, we next address the scope and validity of \u00a7526(a)(4).\nCharacterizing the statute as a broad, content-based restriction on\nattorney-client communications that is not adequately tailored to\nconstrain only speech the Government has a substantial interest in\nrestricting, the Eighth Circuit found the rule substantially\noverbroad. 541 F.\u00a03d, at 793\u2013794, and n.\u00a010. For the\nreasons that follow, we reject that conclusion.Section 526(a)(4)\nprohibits a debt relief agency from \u201cadvis[ing] an assisted person\u201d\neither \u201cto incur more debt in contemplation of\u201d filing for\nbankruptcy \u201cor to pay an attorney or bankruptcy petition preparer\nfee or charge for services\u201d performed in preparation for filing.\nOnly the first of these prohibitions is at issue. In debating the\ncorrectness of the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision, the parties first\ndispute the provision\u2019s scope. The Court of Appeals concluded that\n\u201c\u00a7526(a)(4) broadly prohibits a debt relief agency from advising an\nassisted person \u2026 to incuranyadditional debt when the\nassisted person is contemplating bankruptcy.\u201dId., at 793.\nUnder that reading, an attorney is prohibited from providing all\nmanner of \u201cbeneficial advice\u2014even if the advice could help the\nassisted person avoid filing for bankruptcy altogether.\u201dIbid.Agreeing with the Court of\nAppeals, Milavetz contends that \u00a7526(a)(4) prohibits a debt relief\nagency from advising a client to incur any new debt while\nconsidering whether to file for bankruptcy. Construing the\nprovision more broadly still, Milavetz contends that \u00a7526(a)(4)\nforbids not only affirmative advice but also any discussion of the\nadvantages, disadvantages, or legality of incurring more debt. Like\nthe panel majority\u2019s, Milavetz\u2019s reading rests primarily on its\nview that the ordinary meaning of the phrase \u201cin contemplation of\u201d\nbankruptcy encompasses any advice given to a debtor with the\nawareness that he might soon file for bankruptcy, even if the\nadvice seeks to obviate the need to file. Milavetz also maintains\nthat if \u00a7526(a)(4) were construed more narrowly, as urged by the\nGovernment and the dissent below, it would be so vague as to\ninevitably chill some protected speech.The Government continues to\nadvocate a narrower construction of the statute, urging that\nMilavetz\u2019s reading is untenable and that its vagueness concerns are\nmisplaced. The Government contends that \u00a7526(a)(4)\u2019s restriction on\nadvice to incur more debt \u201cin contemplation of\u201d bankruptcy is most\nnaturally read to forbid only advice to undertake actions to abuse\nthe bankruptcy system. Focusing first on the provision\u2019s text, the\nGovernment points to sources indicating that the phrase \u201cin\ncontemplation of\u201d bankruptcy has long been, and continues to be,\nassociated with abusive conduct. For instance, Black\u2019s Law\nDictionary 336 (8th ed. 2004) (hereinafter Black\u2019s) defines\n\u201ccontemplation of bankruptcy\u201d as \u201c[t]he thought of declaring\nbankruptcy because of the inability to continue current financial\noperations, often coupled with action designed to thwart the\ndistribution of assets in a bankruptcy proceeding.\u201d Use of the\nphrase by Members of Congress illustrates that traditional\ncoupling. See,e.g., S.\u00a0Rep. No. 98\u201365, p. 9 (1983)\n(discussing the practice of \u201c\u00a0\u2018loading up\u2019 [on debt] in\ncontemplation of bankruptcy\u201d); Report of the Commission on the\nBankruptcy Laws of the United States, H.\u00a0R. Doc. No. 93\u2013137,\npt. I, p.\u00a011 (1973) (\u201c[T]he most serious abuse of consumer\nbankruptcy is the number of instances in which individuals have\npurchased a sizable quantity of goods and services on credit on the\neve of bankruptcy in contemplation of obtaining a discharge\u201d). The\nGovernment also points to early American and English judicial\ndecisions to corroborate its contention that \u201cin contemplation of\u201d\nbankruptcy signifies abusive conduct. See,e.g.,In\u00a0re Pearce, 19 F.\u00a0Cas. 50, 53 (No. 10,873) (D.\nVt. 1843);Morganv.Brundrett, 5 B. Ad. 288,\n296\u2013297, 110 Eng. Rep. 798, 801 (K.\u00a0B. 1833) (Parke,\nJ.).To bolster its textual claim, the\nGovernment relies on \u00a7526(a)(4)\u2019s immediate context. According to\nthe Government, the other three subsections of \u00a7526(a) are designed\nto protect debtors from abusive practices by debt relief agencies:\n\u00a7526(a)(1) requires debt relief agencies to perform all promised\nservices; \u00a7526(a)(2) prohibits them from making or advising debtors\nto make false or misleading statements in bankruptcy; and\n\u00a7526(a)(3) prohibits them from misleading debtors regarding the\ncosts or benefits of bankruptcy. When \u00a7526(a)(4) is read in context\nof these debtor-protective provisions, the Government argues,\nconstruing it to prevent debt relief agencies from giving advice\nthat is beneficial to both debtors and their creditors seems\nparticularly nonsensical.Finally, the Government contends\nthat the BAPCPA\u2019s remedies for violations of \u00a7526(a)(4) similarly\ncorroborate its narrow reading. Section 526(c) provides remedies\nfor a debt relief agency\u2019s violation of \u00a7526, \u00a7527, or \u00a7528. Among\nthe actions authorized, a debtor may sue the attorney for remittal\nof fees, actual damages, and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs;\na state attorney general may sue for a resident\u2019s actual damages;\nand a court finding intentional abuse may impose an appropriate\ncivil penalty. \u00a7526(c). The Government also relies on the Fifth\nCircuit\u2019s decision inHershv.United States ex rel.\nMukasey, 553 F.\u00a03d 743 (2008), and Judge Colloton\u2019s\ndissent below for the observation that \u201cCongress\u2019s emphasis on\nactual damages for violations of section 526(a)(4) strongly\nsuggests that Congress viewed that section as aimed at advice to\ndebtors which if followed would have a significant risk of harming\nthe debtor.\u201dId., at 760; see 541 F.\u00a03d, at 800\n(opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part). By contrast,\n\u201clegal and appropriate advice that would be protected by the First\nAmendment, yet prohibited by a broad reading of \u00a7526(a)(4), should\ncause no damage at all.\u201dIbid.;seeHersh, 541\nF.\u00a03d, at 760.Milavetz contends that the\nGovernment\u2019s sources actually undermine its claim that the phrase\n\u201cin contemplation of\u201d bankruptcy necessarily refers to abusive\nconduct. Specifically, Milavetz argues that these authorities\nillustrate that \u201cin contemplation of\u201d bankruptcy is a neutral\nphrase that only implies abusive conduct when attached to an\nadditional, proscriptive term. As Black\u2019s states, the phrase is\n\u201coften coupledwithaction designed to thwart the\ndistribution of assets\u201d in bankruptcy, Black\u2019s 336 (emphasis\nadded), but it carries no independent connotation of abuse. In\nsupport of that conclusion, Milavetz relies on our decision inPender,289 U. S. 472, contending that we\nconstrued \u201cin contemplation of\u201d bankruptcy in that case to describe\n\u201cconduct with a view to a probable bankruptcy filing and nothing\nmore.\u201d Brief for Milavetz 61.After reviewing these competing\nclaims, we are persuaded that a narrower reading of \u00a7526(a)(4) is\nsounder, although we do not adopt precisely the view the Government\nadvocates. The Government\u2019s sources show that the phrase \u201cin\ncontemplation of\u201d bankruptcy has so commonly been associated with\nabusive conduct that it may readily be understood to prefigure\nabuse. As used in \u00a7526(a)(4), however, we think the phrase refers\nto a specific type of misconduct designed to manipulate the\nprotections of the bankruptcy system. In light of our decision inPender, and in context of other sections of the Code, we\nconclude that \u00a7526(a)(4) prohibits a debt relief agency only from\nadvising a debtor to incur more debt because the debtor is filing\nfor bankruptcy, rather than for a valid purpose.Penderaddressed the\nmeaning of former \u00a796(d), which authorized reexamination of a\ndebtor\u2019s payment of attorney\u2019s fees \u201cin contemplation of the filing\nof a petition.\u201d Recognizing \u201c\u00a0\u2018the temptation of a failing\ndebtor to deal too liberally with his property in enabling counsel\nto protect him,\u2019\u00a0\u201d 289 U. S., at 478 (quotingIn re Wood\n& Henderson,210 U. S. 246, 253(1908)), we read \u201cin contemplation of \u2026 filing\u201d in that\ncontext to require that the portended bankruptcy have \u201cinduce[d]\u201d\nthe transfer at issue, 289 U. S., at 477, understanding inducement\nto engender suspicion of abuse. In so construing the statute, we\nidentified the \u201ccontrolling question\u201d as \u201cwhether the thought of\nbankruptcy was the impelling cause of the transaction.\u201dIbid.Given the substantial similarities between \u00a7\u00a796(d)\nand 526(a)(4), we think the controlling question under the latter\nprovision is likewise whether the impelling reason for \u201cadvis[ing]\nan assisted person \u2026 to incur more debt\u201d was the prospect of filing\nfor bankruptcy.To be sure, there are\nrelevant differences between the provision at issue inPenderand the one now under review. Most notably, the\ninquiry inPenderwas as to payments made on the eve of\nbankruptcy, whereas \u00a7526(a)(4) regards advice to incur additional\ndebts. Consistent with that difference, under \u00a796(d) a finding that\na payment was made \u201cin contemplation of\u201d filing resolved only a\nthreshold inquiry triggering further review of the reasonableness\nof the payment; the finding thus supported an inference of abuse\nbut did not conclusively establish it. By contrast, advice to incur\nmore debt because of bankruptcy, as prohibited by \u00a7526(a)(4), will\ngenerally consist of advice to \u201cload up\u201d on debt with the\nexpectation of obtaining its discharge\u2014i.e., conduct that\nis abusiveper se.The statutory context\nsupports the conclusion that \u00a7526(a)(4)\u2019s prohibition primarily\ntargets this type of abuse. Code provisions predating the BAPCPA\nalready sought to prevent the practice of loading up on debt prior\nto filing. Section 523(a)(2), for instance, addressed the attendant\nrisk of manipulation by preventing the discharge of debts obtained\nby false pretenses and making debts for purchases of luxury goods\nor services presumptively nondischargeable. See \u00a7\u00a7523(a)(2)(A) and\n(C) (2000 ed.). The BAPCPA increased the risk of such abuse,\nhowever, by providing a new mechanism for determining a debtor\u2019s\nability to repay. Pursuant to the \u201cmeans tes[t],\u201d \u00a7707(b)(2)(D)\n(2006 ed.), a debtor\u2019s petition for Chapter 7 relief is presumed\nabusive (and may therefore be dismissed or converted to a\nstructured repayment plan under Chapter 13) if the debtor\u2019s current\nmonthly income exceeds his statutorily allowed expenses, including\npayments for secured debt, by more than a prescribed amount. See\n\u00a7\u00a7707(b)(2)(A)(i)\u2013(iv). The test promotes debtor accountability but\nalso enhances incentives to incur additional debt prior to filing,\nas payments on secured debts offset a debtor\u2019s monthly income under\nthe formula. Other amendments effected by the BAPCPA reflect a\nconcern with this practice. For instance, Congress amended\n\u00a7523(a)(2) to expand the exceptions to discharge by lowering the\nthreshold amount of new debt a debtor must assume to trigger the\npresumption of abuse under \u00a7523(a)(2)(C), and it extended the\nrelevant prefiling window. See \u00a7310, 119 Stat. 84. In context,\n\u00a7526(a)(4) is best understood to provide an additional safeguard\nagainst the practice of loading up on debt prior to\nfiling.The Government\u2019s\ncontextual arguments provide additional support for the view that\n\u00a7526(a)(4) was meant to prevent this type of conduct. The companion\nrules of professional conduct in \u00a7\u00a7526(a)(1)\u2013(3) and the remedies\nfor their violation in \u00a7526(c) indicate that Congress was concerned\nwith actions that threaten to harm debtors or creditors. Unlike the\nreasonable financial advice the Eighth Circuit\u2019s broad reading\nwould proscribe, advice to incur more debt because of bankruptcy\npresents a substantial risk of injury to both debtors and\ncreditors. SeeHersh, 553 F.\u00a03d, at 760\u2013761.\nSpecifically, the incurrence of such debt stands to harm a debtor\nif his prepetition conduct leads a court to hold his debts\nnondischargable, see \u00a7523(a)(2), convert his case to another\nchapter, or dismiss it altogether, see \u00a7707(b), thereby defeating\nhis effort to obtain bankruptcy relief. If a debt, although\nmanipulatively incurred, is not timely identified as abusive and\ntherefore is discharged, creditors will suffer harm as a result of\nthe discharge and the consequent dilution of the bankruptcy estate.\nBy contrast, the prudent advice that the Eighth Circuit\u2019s view of\nthe statute forbids would likely benefit both debtors and creditors\nand at the very least should cause no harm. Seeid., at\n760; 541 F.\u00a03d, at 800 (Colloton, J., concurring in part and\ndissenting in part). For all of these reasons, we conclude that\n\u00a7526(a)(4) prohibits a debt relief agency only from advising an\nassisted person to incur more debt when the impelling reason for\nthe advice is the anticipation of bankruptcy.That \u201c[n]o other\nsolution yields as sensible a\u201d result further persuades us of the\ncorrectness of this narrow reading.United Statesv.Granderson,511 U. S. 39, 55 (1994).It would make scant sense to prevent attorneys and\nother debt relief agencies from advising individuals thinking of\nfiling for bankruptcy about options that would be beneficial to\nboth those individuals and their creditors. That construction\nserves none of the purposes of the Bankruptcy Code or the\namendments enacted through the BAPCPA. Milavetz itself acknowledges\nthat its expansive view of \u00a7526(a)(4) would produce absurd results;\nthat is one of its bases for arguing that \u201cdebt relief agency\u201d\nshould be construed to exclude attorneys. Because the language and\ncontext of \u00a7526(a)(4) evidence a more targeted purpose, we can\navoid the absurdity of which Milavetz complains without reaching\nthe result it advocates.For the\nsame reason, we reject Milavetz\u2019s suggestion that \u00a7526(a)(4)\nbroadly prohibits debt relief agencies from discussing covered\nsubjects instead of merely proscribing affirmative advice to\nundertake a particular action. Section 526(a)(4) by its terms\nprevents debt relief agencies only from \u201cadvis[ing]\u201d assisted\npersons \u201cto incur\u201d more debt. Covered professionals remain free to\n\u201ctal[k] fully and candidlyaboutthe incurrence of debt in\ncontemplation of filing a bankruptcy case.\u201d Brief for Milavetz 73.\nSection 526(a)(4) requires professionals only to avoid instructing\nor encouraging assisted persons to take on more debt in that\ncircumstance. Cf. ABA Model Rule of Professional Conduct 1.2(d)\n(2009) (\u201cA lawyer shall not counsel a client to engage, or assist a\nclient, in conduct that the lawyer knows is criminal or fraudulent,\nbut a lawyer may discuss the legal consequences of any proposed\ncourse of conduct with a client and may counsel or assist a client\nto make a good faith effort to determine the validity, scope,\nmeaning or application of the law\u201d). Even if the statute were not\nclear in this regard, we would reach the same conclusion about its\nscope because the inhibition of frank discussion serves no\nconceivable purpose within the statutory scheme. Cf.Johnsonv.United States,529 U. S. 694, 706,\nn.\u00a09 (2000).[Footnote\n5]Finally,\nwe reject Milavetz\u2019s contention that, narrowly construed,\n\u00a7526(a)(4) is impermissibly vague. Milavetz urges that the concept\nof abusive prefiling conduct is too indefinite to withstand\nconstitutional scrutiny and that uncertainty regarding the scope of\nthe prohibition will chill protected speech. We\ndisagree.Under our\nreading of the statute, of course, the prohibited advice is not\ndefined in terms of abusive prefiling conduct but rather the\nincurrence of additional debt when the impelling reason is the\nanticipation of bankruptcy. Even if the test depended upon the\nnotion of abuse, however, Milavetz\u2019s claim would be fatally\nundermined by other provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, to which\nthat concept is no stranger. As discussed above, the Code\nauthorizes a bankruptcy court to decline to discharge fraudulent\ndebts, see \u00a7523(a)(2), or to dismiss a case or convert it to a case\nunder another chapter if it finds that granting relief would\nconstitute abuse, see \u00a7707(b)(1). Attorneys and other professionals\nwho give debtors bankruptcy advice must know of these provisions\nand their consequences for a debtor who in bad faith incurs\nadditional debt prior to filing. Indeed, \u00a7707(b)(4)(C) states that\nan attorney\u2019s signature on bankruptcy filings \u201cshall constitute a\ncertification that the attorney has\u201d determined that the filing\n\u201cdoes not constitute an abuse under [\u00a7707(b)(1)].\u201d Against this\nbackdrop, it is hard to see how a rule that narrowly prohibits an\nattorney from affirmatively advising a client to commit this type\nof abusive prefiling conduct could chill attorney speech or inhibit\nthe attorney-client relationship. Our construction of \u00a7526(a)(4) to\nprevent only advice principally motivated by the prospect of\nbankruptcy further ensures that professionals cannot unknowingly\nrun afoul of its proscription.[Footnote 6] Because the scope of the prohibition is\nadequately defined, both on its own terms and by reference to the\nCode\u2019s other provisions, we reject Milavetz\u2019s vagueness\nclaim.As the\nforegoing shows, the language of the statute, together with other\nevidence of its purpose, makes this narrow reading of \u00a7526(a)(4)\nnot merely a plausible interpretation but the more natural one.\nAccordingly, we reject the Eighth Circuit\u2019s conclusion and hold\nthat a debt relief agency violates \u00a7526(a)(4) only when the impetus\nof the advice to incur more debt is the expectation of filing for\nbankruptcy and obtaining the attendant relief. Because our reading\nof the statute supplies a sufficient ground for reversing the Court\nof Appeals\u2019 decision, and because Milavetz challenges the\nconstitutionality of the statute, as narrowed, only on vagueness\ngrounds, we need not further consider whether the statute so\nconstrued withstands First Amendment\nscrutiny.CFinally, we address the validity of \u00a7528\u2019s\nchallenged disclosure requirements. Our first task in resolving\nthis question is to determine the contours of Milavetz\u2019s claim.\nAlthough the nature of its challenge is not entirely clear from the\nbriefing or decisions below, counsel for Milavetz insisted at oral\nargument that this is \u201cnot a facial challenge; it\u2019s an as-applied\nchallenge.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 26. We will approach the question\nconsistent with Milavetz\u2019s characterization.[Footnote 7]We next consider the standard of scrutiny\napplicable to \u00a7528\u2019s disclosure requirements. The parties agree, as\ndo we, that the challenged provisions regulate only commercial\nspeech. Milavetz contends that our decision inCentral Hudson\nGas & Elec. Corp.v.Public Serv. Comm\u2019n of\nN.\u00a0Y.,447\nU. S. 557(1980), supplies the proper standard for reviewing\nthese requirements. The Court in that case held that restrictions\non nonmisleading commercial speech regarding lawful activity must\nwithstand intermediate scrutiny\u2014that is, they must \u201cdirectly\nadvanc[e]\u201d a substantial governmental interest and be \u201cn[o] more\nextensive than is necessary to serve that interest.\u201dId.,\nat 566. Contesting Milavetz\u2019s premise, the Government maintains\nthat \u00a7528 is directed atmisleadingcommercial speech. For\nthat reason, and because the challenged provisions impose a\ndisclosure requirement rather than an affirmative limitation on\nspeech, the Government contends that the less exacting scrutiny\ndescribed inZauderergoverns our review. We\nagree.Zaudereraddressed the validity of a\nrule of professional conduct that required attorneys who advertised\ncontingency-fee services to disclose in their advertisements that a\nlosing client might still be responsible for certain litigation\nfees and costs. Noting that First Amendment protection for\ncommercial speech is justified in large part by the information\u2019s\nvalue to consumers, the Court concluded that an attorney\u2019s\nconstitutionally protected interest innotproviding the\nrequired factual information is \u201cminimal.\u201d 471 U. S., at 651.\nUnjustified or unduly burdensome disclosure requirements offend the\nFirst Amendment by chilling protected speech, but \u201can advertiser\u2019s\nrights are adequately protected as long as disclosure requirements\nare reasonably related to the State\u2019s interest in preventing\ndeception of consumers.\u201dIbid.The\nchallenged provisions of \u00a7528 share the essential features of the\nrule at issue inZauderer. As in that case, \u00a7528\u2019s\nrequired disclosures are intended to combat the problem of\ninherently misleading commercial advertisements\u2014specifically, the\npromise of debt relief without any reference to the possibility of\nfiling for bankruptcy, which has inherent costs. Additionally, the\ndisclosures entail only an accurate statement identifying the\nadvertiser\u2019s legal status and the character of the assistance\nprovided, and they do not prevent debt relief agencies like\nMilavetz from conveying any additional\ninformation.The same\ncharacteristics of \u00a7528 that make it analogous to the rule inZaudererserve to distinguish it from those at issue inIn re R. M. J.,455 U. S. 191(1982), to\nwhich the Court applied the intermediate scrutiny ofCentral\nHudson. The ethical rules addressed inR.\u00a0M.\u00a0J.prohibited attorneys from advertising\ntheir practice areas in terms other than those prescribed by the\nState Supreme Court and from announcing the courts in which they\nwere admitted to practice. See 455 U. S., at 197\u2013198. Finding that\nthe restricted statements were not inherently misleading and that\nthe State had failed to show that the appellant\u2019s advertisements\nwere themselves likely to mislead consumers, seeid., at\n205, the Court appliedCentral Hudson\u2019s intermediate\nscrutiny and invalidated the restrictions as insufficiently\ntailored to any substantial state interest, 455 U. S., at 205\u2013206.\nIn so holding, the Court emphasized that States retain authority to\nregulate inherently misleading advertisements, particularly through\ndisclosure requirements, and it noted that advertisements for\nprofessional services pose a special risk of deception. Seeid., at 203, 207.Milavetz\nmakes much of the fact that the Government in these consolidated\ncases has adduced no evidence that its advertisements are\nmisleading.Zaudererforecloses that argument: \u201cWhen the\npossibility of deception is as self-evident as it is in this case,\nwe need not require the State to \u2018conduct a survey of the \u2026 public\nbefore it [may] determine that the [advertisement] had a tendency\nto mislead.\u2019\u00a0\u201d 471 U. S., at 652\u2013653 (quotingFTCv.Colgate-Palmolive Co.,380 U. S. 374, 391\u2013392\n(1965)). Evidence in the congressional record demonstrating a\npattern of advertisements that hold out the promise of debt relief\nwithout alerting consumers to its potential cost, see 1998\nHearings, pt. III, at 86, 90\u201394,is adequate to\nestablish that the likelihood of deception in this case \u201cis hardly\na speculative one,\u201d 471 U. S., at\n652.Milavetz alternatively argues that the term\n\u201cdebt relief agency\u201d is confusing and misleading and that requiring\nits inclusion in advertisements cannot be \u201creasonably related\u201d to\nthe Government\u2019s interest in preventing consumer deception, asZaudererrequires.Id., at 651. This contention\namounts to little more than a preference on Milavetz\u2019s part for\nreferring to itself as something other than a \u201cdebt relief\nagency\u201d\u2014e.g., an attorney or a law firm. For several\nreasons, we conclude that this preference lacks any constitutional\nbasis. First, Milavetz offers no evidence to support its claim that\nthe label is confusing. Because \u00a7528 by its terms applies only to\ndebt relief agencies, the disclosures are necessarily accurate to\nthat extent: Only debt relief agencies must identify themselves as\nsuch in their advertisements. This statement provides interested\nobservers with pertinent information about the advertiser\u2019s\nservices and client obligations.Other information that Milavetz must or may\ninclude in its advertisements for bankruptcy-assistance services\nprovides additional assurance that consumers will not misunderstand\nthe term. The required statement that the advertiser\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018help[s] people file for bankruptcy relief\u2019\u00a0\u201d gives\nmeaningful context to the term \u201cdebt relief agency.\u201d And Milavetz\nmay further identify itself as a law firm or attorney. Section 528\nalso gives Milavetz flexibility to tailor the disclosures to its\nindividual circumstances, as long as the resulting statements are\n\u201csubstantially similar\u201d to the statutory examples. \u00a7\u00a7528(a)(4) and\n(b)(2)(B).Finally, we reject Milavetz\u2019s argument that\n\u00a7528 is not reasonably related to any governmental interest because\nit applies equally to attorneys who represent creditors, as\nMilavetz sometimes does. The required disclosures, Milavetz\ncontends, would be counterfactual and misleading in that context.\nThis claim is premised on an untenable reading of the statute. We\nthink it evident from the definition of \u201cassisted person\u201d\u2014which is\nstated in terms of the person\u2019s debts, see \u00a7101(3)\u2014and from the\ntext and structure of the debt-relief-agency provisions in \u00a7\u00a7526,\n527, and 528 that those provisions, including \u00a7528\u2019s disclosure\nrequirements, govern only professionals who offer\nbankruptcy-related services to consumer debtors. Section 528 is\nitself expressly concerned with advertisements pertaining to\n\u201cbankruptcy assistance services,\u201d \u201cthe benefits of bankruptcy,\u201d\n\u201cexcessive debt, debt collection pressure, or inability to pay any\nconsumer debt,\u201d \u00a7\u00a7528(a)(3) and (b)(2). Moreover, like the other\ndebt-relief-agency provisions, that section is codified in a\nsubchapter of the Bankruptcy Code entitled \u201cdebtor\u2019s\nduties and benefits.\u201d 11 U. S.\u00a0C., ch. 5, subch. II. In\ncontext, reading \u00a7528 to govern advertisements aimed at creditors\nwould be as anomalous as the result of which Milavetz complains.\nOnce again, we decline Milavetz\u2019s invitation to adopt a view of the\nstatute that is contrary to its plain meaning and would produce an\nabsurd result.Because \u00a7528\u2019s requirements that Milavetz\nidentify itself as a debt relief agency and include certain\ninformation about its bankruptcy-assistance and related services\nare \u201creasonably related to the [Government\u2019s] interest in\npreventing deception of consumers,\u201dZauderer, 471 U. S.,\nat 651, we uphold those provisions as applied to\nMilavetz.IVFor the foregoing reasons, the\njudgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit is affirmed\nas to \u00a7\u00a7101(12A) and 528 and reversed as to \u00a7526(a)(4), and the\ncases are remanded for further proceedings consistent with this\nopinion.It is so\nordered.Footnote\n1Congress excluded from the definition of\n\u201cdebt relief agency\u201d any \u201cofficer, director, employee, or agent of\na person who provides [bankruptcy] assistance\u201d; any \u201cnonprofit\norganization that is exempt from taxation under section 501(c)(3)\nof the Internal Revenue Code of 1986\u201d; \u201ca creditor of [an] assisted\nperson\u201d who is helping that person \u201cto restructure any debt owed \u2026\nto the creditor\u201d; \u201ca depository institution\u201d; or \u201can author,\npublisher, distributor, or seller of works subject to copyright\nprotection under title 17, when acting in such capacity.\u201d\n\u00a7\u00a7101(12A)(A)\u2013(E).Footnote\n2Compare 541 F.\u00a03d 785, 794 (CA8 2008)\n(case below), withHershv.United States ex rel.\nMukasey, 553 F.\u00a03d 743, 761, 764 (CA5 2008) (holding that\n\u00a7526(a)(4) can be narrowly construed to prohibit only advice to\nabuse or manipulate the bankruptcy system and that, so construed,\nit is constitutional).Footnote\n3Although reliance on legislative history\nis unnecessary in light of the statute\u2019s unambiguous language, we\nnote the support that record provides for the Government\u2019s reading.\nStatements in a Report of the House Committee on the Judiciary\nregarding the Act\u2019s purpose indicate concern with abusive practices\nundertaken by attorneys as well as other bankruptcy professionals.\nSee,e.g.,H.\u00a0R. Rep. No. 109\u201331, pt. 1, p.\u00a05\n(2005) (hereinafter H.\u00a0R. Rep.). And the legislative record\nelsewhere documents misconduct by attorneys. See,e.g.,Hearing on H.\u00a0R. 3150 before the Subcommittee on Commercial\nand Administrative Law of the House Committee on the Judiciary,\n105th Cong., 2d Sess., pt. III, p. 95 (1998) (hereinafter 1998\nHearings). (While the 1998 Hearings preceded the BAPCPA\u2019s enactment\nby several years, they form part of the record cited by the 2005\nHouse Report. See H.\u00a0R. Rep., at\n7.)Footnote\n4Reviving an argument that Milavetz\nabandoned,amicicontend that \u00a7527(b) undermines the\nGovernment\u2019s reading of \u00a7101(12A) because it requires a debt relief\nagency to inform an assisted person of his right to hire an\nattorney, and it would be nonsensical to require attorneys to\nprovide such notice. See Brief for National Association of Consumer\nBankruptcy Attorneys et\u00a0al. asAmici Curiae34. This\nargument fails on its own terms. Even if \u00a7101(12A) excluded\nattorneys, as Milavetz contends, \u00a7527(b) would still produce the\nresult of which itsamicicomplain, as that provision also\nrequires a debt relief agency to inform assisted persons that they\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018can get help in some localities from a bankruptcy petition\npreparer,\u2019\u00a0\u201d and there is no question that bankruptcy petition\npreparers are debt relief agencies and thus subject to that\nrequirement. It is in any event not absurd to require debt relief\nagencies\u2014whether attorneys or bankruptcy petition preparers\u2014to\ninform prospective clients of their options for obtaining\nbankruptcy-assistance\nservices.Footnote\n5If read as Milavetz advocates, \u00a7526(a)(4)\nwould seriously undermine the attorney-client relationship. Earlier\nthis Term, we acknowledged the importance of the attorney-client\nprivilege as a means of protecting that relationship and fostering\nrobust discussion. SeeMohawk Industries, Inc.v.Carpenter, 558 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 7).\nReiterating the significance of such dialogue, we note that\n\u00a7526(a)(4), as narrowly construed, presents no impediment to\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018full and frank\u2019\u00a0\u201d discussions.Ibid. (quotingUpjohn Co.v.United States,449 U. S. 383, 389\n(1981)).Footnote\n6The hypothetical questions Milavetz posits\nregarding the permissibility of advice to incur debt in certain\ncircumstances, see Brief for Milavetz 48\u201351, are easily answered by\nreference to whether the expectation of filing for bankruptcy (and\nobtaining a discharge) impelled the advice. We emphasize that\nawareness of the possibility of bankruptcy is insufficient to\ntrigger \u00a7526(a)(4)\u2019s prohibition. Instead, that provision\nproscribes only advice to incur more debt that is principally\nmotivated by that likelihood. Thus, advice to refinance a mortgage\nor purchase a reliable car prior to filing because doing so will\nreduce the debtor\u2019s interest rates or improve his ability to repay\nis not prohibited, as the promise of enhanced financial prospects,\nrather than the anticipated filing, is the impelling cause. Advice\nto incur additional debt to buy groceries, pay medical bills, or\nmake other purchases \u201creasonably necessary for the support or\nmaintenance of the debtor or a dependent of the debtor,\u201d\n\u00a7523(a)(2)(C)(ii)(II), is similarly\npermissible.Footnote\n7In so doing, we note that our ability to\nevaluate \u00a7528\u2019s validity as applied to Milavetz is constrained by\nthe lack of a developed record. Because the parties have introduced\nno exhibits or other evidence to ground our analysis, we are guided\nin this preenforcement challenge only by Milavetz\u2019s\nstatus\u2014i.e., as a law firm or attorney\u2014and its general\nclaims about the nature of its\nadvertisements.",
