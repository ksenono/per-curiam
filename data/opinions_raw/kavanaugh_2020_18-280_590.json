Post,at 25; seeDistrict of Columbiav.Heller,554 U.S.\n570(2008);McDonaldv.Chicago,561 U.S.\n742(2010);Hellerv.District of Columbia, 670\nF.3d 1244 (CADC 2011) (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting). And I share\nJustice Alito\u2019s concern that some federal and state courts may not\nbe properly applyingHellerandMcDonald. The Court\nshould address that issue soon, perhaps in one of the several\nSecond Amendment cases with petitions for certiorari now pending\nbefore the Court.",
