The FTCA waives the\nimmunity of the United States for certain tort claims but provides\nthat any \u201ctort claim against the United States shall be forever\nbarred unless\u201d it is filed with the appropriate agency \u201cwithintwo\nyears after such claim accrues\u201d and in federal court \u201cwithin six\nmonths after\u201d the agency\u2019s final decision.28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a72401(b). The statutory text, its historical roots, and more than a\ncentury of precedents show that this absolute bar is not subject to\nequitable tolling. I would enforce the statute as Congress intended\nand reverse.IThe FTCA is a waiver of sovereign immunity and must be\nunderstood in that context. In the 19th and early 20th centuries,\nCongress was reluctant to allow individual tort claims against the\nUnited States. Instead, it granted relief to individuals through\nprivate laws enacted solely for those individuals\u2019 benefit. These\nwaivers of sovereign immunity were surgical and sporadic, but\n\u201cnotoriously clumsy,\u201d and by 1946 Congress thought it better to\nadopt a \u201csimplified\u201d approach.Dalehitev.United\nStates,346 U.\u00a0S. 15\u201325 (1953). The FTCA thus waived\nsovereign immunity for tort claims against the Government and set\nout a procedure for adjudicating those claims.This waiver of sovereign immunity was no trivial matter. Long\nbefore the FTCA, Congress authorized suits against the Government\nfor contract and property claims under the Tucker Act and a number\nof predecessor statutes, but the Tucker Act excluded tort claims\nfrom its waiver of sovereign immunity. The concern was obvious: As\nopposed to the more predictable nature of contractual and property\nclaims, tort-based harms are sometimes unperceived and open-ended.\nEven frivolous claims require the Federal Government to expend\nadministrative and litigation costs, which ultimately fall upon\nsociety at-large. For every dollar spent to defend against or to\nsat-isfy a tort claim against the United States, the Government\nmust either raise taxes or shift funds originally allocated to\ndifferent public programs.To reduce these risks, Congress placed strict limits on the\nFTCA\u2019s waiver of sovereign immunity. The statute \u201cexempts from\n[its] waiver certain categories of claims,\u201dAliv.Federal Bureau of Prisons,552 U.\u00a0S. 214,218 (2008), and\nincludes a broad exemption for claims \u201carising out of assault,\nbattery, false imprisonment, false arrest, malicious prosecution,\nabuse of process, libel, slander, misrepresentation, deceit, or\ninterference with contract rights.\u201d28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72680(h);\nsee also \u00a7\u00a72680(a)\u2013(n). In addition, in order to limit the scope\nand unpredictability of the Government\u2019s potential liability, the\nAct exempts from the waiver of sovereign immunity certain types of\nrecovery, such as prejudgment interest and punitive damages. See\n\u00a72674.Most relevant here, the FTCA \u201ccondition[s]\u201d its waiver of\nsovereign immunity on strict filing deadlines.United Statesv.Kubrick,444 U.\u00a0S. 111,117 (1979). As enacted in\n1946, the Act granted district courts exclusive jurisdiction over\ntort claims against the Government, \u201c[s]ubject to the [other]\nprovisions of\u201d the Act. FTCA, ch. 753, \u00a7410(a),60Stat.843\u2013844. One\nof those provisions stated that \u201c[e]very claim against the United\nStates cognizable under this title shall be forever barred, unless\nwithin one year after such claim accrued .\u00a0.\u00a0. it is\npresented in writing to the [relevant] Federal agency\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. or .\u00a0.\u00a0. an action is begun\u201d in federal\ncourt. \u00a7420,id., at 845. The current version provides in\nfull as follows:\u201cA tort claim against the United States shall be forever barred\nunless it is presented in writing to the appropriate Federal agency\nwithin two years after such claim accrues or unless action is begun\nwithin six months after the date of mailing, by certified or\nregistered mail, of notice of final denial of the claim by the\nagency to which it was presented.\u201d28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a72401(b).IIThe question presented in these two cases is whether the FTCA\u2019s\nfiling deadlines are subject to equitable tolling. We must\ntherefore decide (1) whether the deadlines are \u201cjurisdictional\u201d in\nnature, so that courts are without power to adjudicate claims filed\noutside their strict limits and (2) if they are not jurisdictional,\nwhether the statute nonetheless prohibits equitable tolling. Both\nof these inquiries require close attention to the text, context,\nand history of the Act. And both lead to the conclusion that the\nFTCA allows no equitable tolling.AThe FTCA\u2019s filing deadlines are jurisdictional. The statute\u2019s\nplain text prohibits adjudication of untimely claims. Once the\nAct\u2019s filing deadlines have run, all untimely claims \u201cshall be\nforever barred.\u201dIbid.These words are not qualified or\naspirational. They are absolute. If not filed with the agency\nwithin two years, or with a federal court within six months, a\nclaim \u201cshall be\u201d \u201cbarred\u201d \u201cfor-ever.\u201d \u201cShall be forever barred\u201d is\nnot generally understood to mean \u201cshould be allowed sometimes.\u201d The\nstatute brooks no exceptions. And because the filing deadlines\nrestrict the FTCA\u2019s waiver of sovereign immunity, they impose a\nlimit on the courts\u2019 jurisdiction that \u201cwe should not take it upon\nourselves to extend.\u201dKubrick,supra, at 117\u2013118.For over 130 years, we have understood these terms as\njurisdictional. When crafting the FTCA\u2019s limitations provision,\nCongress did not write on a clean slate. Rather, it borrowed\nlanguage from limitations provisions in the Tucker Act and its\npredecessor statutes. The 1911 version of the Tucker Act included\nlanguage that was nearly identical to that in the 1946 version of\nthe FTCA: \u201cEvery claim against the United States cognizable by the\nCourt of Claims, shall be forever barred unless the petition\nsetting forth a statement thereof is filed in the court\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. within six years after the claim first accrues.\u201d\n\u00a7156,36Stat.1139. That statutory language came, in turn, from the\n1863 predecessor to the Tucker Act. See \u00a710,12Stat.767.As early as 1883, we interpreted these precise terms to impose a\n\u201cjurisdiction[al]\u201d requirement that the \u201ccourt may not disregard.\u201dKendallv.United States,107 U.\u00a0S. 123. We\nemphasized that, when waiving sovereign immunity, Congress \u201cmay\nrestrict the jurisdiction of the [courts] to certain classes of\ndemands.\u201dIbid.And we held that \u201c[t]he express words of the\nstatute leave no room for contention.\u201dIbid.The Court thus\nhad no \u201cauthority to engraft\u201d an equitable tolling provision where\nCongress had so clearly constrained the judiciary\u2019s authority.Ibid.Over the ensuing decades, we repeatedly reaffirmed our\ninterpretation of the phrase. InFinnv.United\nStates,123 U.\u00a0S. 227,232 (1887), we held that the\nGovernment could not waive the jurisdictional time bar and thus\nthat the \u201cduty of the court\u201d was \u201cto dismiss the petition\u201d when a\nplaintiff raised an untimely claim. We reached the same conclusion\ninDe Arnaudv.United States,151 U.\u00a0S. 483\u2013496\n(1894). We reaffirmed the rule inUnited Statesv.New\nYork,160 U.\u00a0S. 598\u2013619 (1896), while holding that therewasjurisdiction where the plaintiff presented its claim\nbefore the statutory deadline. And inMunrov.United\nStates,303 U.\u00a0S. 36, n.\u00a01, 41 (1938), we held that a\nDistrict Court lacked jurisdiction to resolve un-timely claims,\neven if the Government waived any objection, under a different\nstatute that incorporated the Tucker Act\u2019s time limits. All the\nwhile, the lower courts similarly enforced the deadline as \u201ca\njurisdictional requirement, compliance with which is necessary to\nenable suit to be maintained against the sovereign.\u201dCompagnie\nGenerale Transatlantiquev.United States, 51 F.\u00a02d\n1053, 1056 (CA2 1931). Thus, by 1946, the phrase \u201cshall be forever\nbarred\u201d was well understood to deprive federal courts of\njurisdiction over untimely claims.[1]The FTCA\u2019s statutory terms must be understood in this context.\nWhen Congress crafted the FTCA as a tort-based analogue to the\nTucker Act, it consciously borrowed the well-known wording of the\nTucker Act\u2019s filing deadline. Then, as now, it was settled that\n\u201c[i]n adopting the language used in an earlier act, Congress must\nbe considered to have adopted also the construction given by this\nCourt to such language, and made it a part of the enactment.\u201dHechtv.Malley,265 U.\u00a0S. 144,153 (1924); see\nalsoShapirov.United States,335 U.\u00a0S. 1,16\n(1948);Sekharv.United States, 570 U.\u00a0S. ___,\n___\u2013___ (2013) (slip op., at 3\u20134) (\u201c\u00a0\u2018[I]f a word is obviously\ntransplanted from another legal source, whether the common law or\nother legislation, it brings the old soil with it\u2019\u00a0\u201d (quoting\nFrankfurter, Some Reflections on the Reading of Statutes, 47 Colum.\nL.\u00a0Rev. 527, 537 (1947))).Indeed, Congress considered departing from the Tucker Act\u2019s\nprohibition on equitable tolling, but decided against it. Proposals\nto include an equitable tolling provision were \u201cincluded in nine of\nthe thirty-one bills prior to the enactment of the FTCA,\u201d but \u201cthe\nAct passed by the 1946 Congress did not provide for any equitable\ntolling of the limitations periods.\u201d Colella & Bain, Revisiting\nEquitable Tolling and the Federal Tort Claims Act, 31 Seton Hall\nL.\u00a0Rev. 174, 195\u2013196 (2000). Instead, it was understood that\nindividuals with claims outside those deadlines could turn to\nCongress for relief through private bills, as they did before the\nFTCA\u2019s enactment. Seeid.,at 195.[2]The evidence of statutory meaning does not end there. We\nreaffirmed the phase\u2019s jurisdictional nature in the decades\nfollowing the FTCA\u2019s enactment. InSorianov.United\nStates,352 U.\u00a0S. 270 (1957), we rejected a request to\nallow equitable tolling under the Tucker Act. Confirming the\nconnection between the Tucker Act and the FTCA, we noted that\n\u201cstatutes permitting suits for tax refunds,tort actions,\nalien property litigation, patent cases, and other claims against\nthe Government would be affected\u201d if the Court allowed equitable\ntolling under the Tucker Act.Id., at 275 (emphasis added).\nAnd inKubrick, 444 U.\u00a0S., at 117\u2013118, we citedSoriano\u2019s warning while emphasizing that the FTCA\u2019s time\nlimits are a condition of the Act\u2019s waiver of sovereign\nimmunity.The lower courts also quickly recognized the statutes\u2019 common\nheritage and enforced \u00a72401(b) as a jurisdictional requirement. InAndereggv.United States, 171 F.\u00a02d 127, 128\n(1948) (per curiam), the Fourth Circuit citedFinnandMunrowhile holding that the FTCA\u2019s filing deadline is a\njurisdictional limit that the Government cannot waive. The Fifth\nCircuit, inSimonv.United States, 244 F.\u00a02d\n703, 705, n. 4 (1957), held that the FTCA\u2019s deadline is a\njurisdictional condition on the Act\u2019s waiver of sovereign immunity\nand citedCarpenterv.United States, 56 F.\u00a02d\n828, 829 (CA2 1932), a Tucker Act case, to support its holding. And\ninHumphreysv.United States, 272 F.\u00a02d 411\n(1959), the Ninth Circuit similarly relied on Tucker Act precedents\nto hold that \u201cthe District Court has no jurisdiction over [an\nuntimely FTCA] action,\u201d because no waiver of sovereign immunity\nexists once the filing deadline \u201chas run.\u201dId.,at 412\n(citingEdwardsv.United States, 163 F.\u00a02d 268,\n269 (CA9 1947), in turn citingFinnandMunro). When\nCongress amended the FTCA in 1966, it readopted the \u201cforever\nbarred\u201d language against the backdrop ofSorianoand the\nlower courts\u2019 interpretation of the phrase. We must therefore\nassume that Congress meant to keep the universally recognized\nmeaning of those words. See,e.g., General Dynamics Land\nSystems, Inc.v.Cline,540 U.\u00a0S. 581\u2013594\n(2004).That meaning, of course, cannot change over time. But even if\nthere were any doubt, we recently reaffirmed our view inJohn R.\nSand & Gravel Co.v.United States,552 U.\u00a0S.\n130 (2008). We explained that, unlike run-of-the-mill statutes of\nlimitation, jurisdictional time limits \u201cseek .\u00a0.\u00a0. to\nachieve a broader system-related goal, such as facilitating the\nadministration of claims, limiting the scope of a governmental\nwaiver of sovereign immunity, or promoting judicial efficiency.\u201dId., at 133 (citations omitted). Recounting our decisions inKendall,Finn,De Arnaud,New York, andSoriano, we \u201creiterated\u201d our understanding of the \u201cabsolute\nnature of the court of claims limitations statute.\u201d 552 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 135. And we rejected an invitation to abandon that\ninterpretation, noting that Congress has long accepted our\ninterpretation of the statute.Id.,at 139.The same must be said of the FTCA. As we have often explained,\n\u201c[w]hen a long line of this Court\u2019s decisions left undisturbed by\nCongress has treated a similar requirement as \u2018jurisdictional,\u2019 we\nwill presume that Congress intended to follow that course.\u201dHendersonv.Shinseki,562 U.\u00a0S. 428,436 (2011)\n(citation and some internal quotation marks omitted);Reed\nElsevier, Inc.v.Muchnick,559 U.\u00a0S. 154,168\n(2010);Union Pacific R.\u00a0Co.v.Locomotive\nEngineers,558 U.\u00a0S. 67,82 (2009). Every single decision\nfrom this Court interpreting the Tucker Act\u2019s \u201csimilar requirement\u201d\nhas treated it as jurisdictional. And there is strong historical\nevidence that Congress \u201cintended to follow that course.\u201d That\nshould be the end of the matter: Section 2410(b)\u2019s filing deadlines\nare jurisdictional limits that are not subject to equitable\ntolling.BEven if the FTCA\u2019s filing deadlines are not jurisdic-tional,\nthey still prohibit equitable tolling. To be sure, in recent years,\nwe have grown reluctant to affix the \u201cjurisdictional\u201d label. See,e.g., Arbaughv.Y & H Corp.,546 U.\u00a0S.\n500,510 (2006);Henderson,supra,at 434\u2013436. \u201cBut\ncalling a rule nonjurisdictional does not mean that it is not\nmandatory.\u201dGonzalezv.Thaler, 565 U.\u00a0S. ___,\n___ (2012) (slip op., at 10). Where Congress imposes an inflexible\nclaims processing rule, it is our duty to enforce the law and\nprohibit equitable tolling, whether it is jurisdictional or\nnot.Here, Congress\u2019 intent is clear. The words of the statute leave\nno doubt that untimely claims are never allowed: They are\n\u201cforeverbarred.\u201d This is no weak-kneed command. The history\nunderlying the text only bolsters its apparent meaning, and our\nrepeated reaffirmation of the phrase\u2019s meaning should remove any\ndoubt. Congress never meant for equitable tolling to be available\nunder the FTCA.The only factor pointing in the opposite direction is our\nsuggestion inIrwinv.Department of Veterans\nAffairs,498 U.\u00a0S. 89\u201396 (1990), that we would thenceforth\napply a rebuttable presumption in favor of equitable tolling in\nsuits against the Government. But it is beyond me howIrwin\u2019s judge-made presumption announced in 1990 can trump\nthe obvious meaning of a statute enacted many decades earlier. Cf.Cannonv.University of Chicago,441 U.\u00a0S.\n677,718 (1979) (Rehnquist, J., concurring). In any event,Irwin\u2019s rebuttable presumption is overcome in this case. For\nwell over a century, we have recognized the inflexible nature of\nthe Tucker Act\u2019s provision. Since its adoption, we have recognized\nthat the FTCA\u2019s language bears the same meaning as its Tucker Act\ncompanion. SeeSoriano,supra, at 275;Kubrick,supra, at 118. And inJohn R. Sand &\nGravel, we held that our \u201cdefinitive ear-lier interpretation of\nthe\u201d Tucker Act is a \u201csufficient rebuttal\u201d toIrwin\u2019s\npresumption. 552 U.\u00a0S., at 138. There is no principled way to\ndistinguish this case. Section 2401(b) allows no equitable\ntolling.IIIThe Court\u2019s contrary conclusion is wrong at every step. In its\nview, \u00a72401(b)\u2019s statutory text is \u201cmundane\u201d language that\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018reads like an ordinary, run-of-the-mill statute of\nlimitations.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAnte,at 8. But \u201cordinary\u201d\nnonjurisdictional time limits are typically directed at claimants.\nThe deadline inHenderson, for example, required that \u201ca\npersonadversely affected by [a Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals]\ndecision shall file a notice of appeal .\u00a0.\u00a0. within 120\ndays after\u201d the decision.38 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a77266(a) (emphasis\nadded); 562 U.\u00a0S, at 438. The \u201crun-of-the-mill\u201d limitations\nprovision inHollandv.Florida,560 U.\u00a0S.\n631,647 (2010), likewise applied to the \u201cperson\u201d responsible for\nfiling: \u201cA1-year period of limitation shall apply to an application\nfor a writ of habeas corpusby a personin custody pursuant\nto the judgment of a State court.\u201d28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72244(d)(1)\n(emphasis added); 560 U.\u00a0S., at 635. And the provision at\nissue inIrwinwas similar, if not an even weaker command.\nIt provided that \u201c\u00a0\u2018[w]ithin thirty days of receipt of notice\nof final action taken by .\u00a0.\u00a0. the Equal Employment\nOpportunity Commission .\u00a0.\u00a0. anemployee or\napplicantfor employment .\u00a0.\u00a0.may filea\ncivil action.\u2019\u00a0\u201d 498 U.\u00a0S., at 94 (quoting42\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72000e\u201316(c) (1998 ed.); emphasis added).Section 2401(b), by contrast, never mentions the claimant, and\nit is phrased in emphatically absolute terms. It says unequivocally\nthat untimely tort claims against the United States \u201cshall be\nforever barred.\u201d Although it does not use the word \u201cjurisdiction,\u201d\nit speaks at least as much to the courts (who are \u201cforever barred\u201d\nfrom considering untimely claims) as it does to claimants (who are\n\u201cforever barred\u201d from bringing stale claims). More important,\nthough, the words in \u00a72401(b) have a well-known meaning thatipse dixitlabels cannot overcome.[3]The majority tells us this \u201cold \u2018ad\u00a0hoc,\u2019 law-by-law\napproach\u201d\u2014also known asstatutory interpretation\u2014has been\nreplaced with a broad presumption in favor of equitable tolling and\na judicial preference against jurisdictional labels.Ante,at 4. I dispute the premise. But in any event, as I explained\nabove, and as six Members of the current Court held inJohn R.\nSand & Gravel, the overwhelming evidence of congressional\nintent here easily overtakesIrwin\u2019s rebuttable presumption.\nEven if we would rather not call \u00a72401(b)\u2019s deadlines\n\u201cjurisdictional,\u201d with all that label entails, we must nonetheless\nrecognize that Congress never meant to allow equitable tolling.The majority avoids this latter point by declining to give it\nany separate attention. Seeante,at 5, n. 2. But we cannot\nconflate the two questions because, though the relevant evidence is\nthe same, the analysis is different. In particular, the majority is\nwrong to rely onIrwinwhen assessing the jurisdictional\nquestion, which is the only question it really decides. We do not\nindulgeIrwin\u2019s presumption when determining whether a\nrequirement is jurisdictional. Instead, we typically invokeIrwinonlyafterfinding that a requirement is not\njurisdictional, to decide whether Congress nonetheless intended to\nprohibit equitable tolling. InHenderson, for instance, we\nnever mentionedIrwinbecause the parties did not ask us to\naddress whether the rule was \u201csubject to equitable tolling if it\n[was] not jurisdictional.\u201d 562 U.\u00a0S., at 442, n.\u00a04.\nLikewise, inBowlesv.Russell,551 U.\u00a0S. 205\n(2007), we held that the deadline for filing a notice of appeal is\njurisdictional, without a word aboutIrwin.[4] InSebeliusv.Auburn Regional Medical\nCenter, 568 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___\u2013___, ___\u2013___, (2013) (slip op.,\nat 6\u20137, 11\u201313), we consideredIrwinonly after deciding that\na deadline was not jurisdictional. And inHolland, we held\nthat the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996\u2019s\ntime limits are not jurisdictional, without relying onIrwin, and then stated that \u201c[w]e have previously made clear\nthat a nonjurisdictional federal statute of limitations is normally\nsubject to a \u2018rebuttable presumption\u2019 in favor \u2018of equitable\ntolling.\u2019\u00a0\u201d 560 U.\u00a0S., at 645\u2013646 (quotingIrwin,supra, at 95\u201396) (emphasis deleted); cf.Youngv.United States,535 U.\u00a0S. 43\u201350 (2002) (invokingIrwinafter concluding that a limitations period was not a\n\u201csubstantive\u201d component of the Bankruptcy Code).[5] This error matters because the majority\u2019s\njurisdictional analysis literally begins and ends withIrwin, seeante,at 4\u20135, 18, and thus relies on a\npresumption that should have no bearing on the question. Without\nthat presumption, the majority could not so readily ignore the\nunmistakable evidence that \u00a72401(b)\u2019s limits are\njurisdictional.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*For these reasons, I would hold that \u00a72401(b) does not allow\nequitable tolling, and I therefore respectfully dissent.Notes1At times in the past we have too\nloosely conferred the \u201cjurisdic-tional\u201d label. SeeSteel Co.v.Citizens for Better Environment,523 U.\u00a0S. 83,90\n(1998). But our use of the term in this context was conscious, as\nwe recognized inJohn R. Sand & Gravel Co.v.United\nStates,552 U.\u00a0S. 130,134 (2008) (\u201cJustice Harlan, writing\nfor the Court, said the statute was \u2018jurisdiction[al],\u2019\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. and that \u2018it [was] the duty of the court to\nraise the [timeliness] question whether it [was] done by plea or\nnot\u2019\u00a0\u201d (quotingKendallv.United States,107\nU.\u00a0S. 123,125 (1883))). And it was correct.2Congress has occasionally modified\nthe FTCA\u2019s limitations provision. Initially, the Act required\nplaintiffs to file suit within one year of a claim\u2019s accrual, or if\nthe claim was for less than $1,000 to present the claim to the\nappropriate agency within one year of accrual. FTCA\n\u00a7420,60Stat.845. In 1949, to relieve the hardship of the 1-year\ndeadline, Congress enlarged the filing deadline to two years. Act\nof Apr. 25, ch. 92, \u00a71,63Stat.62. Then, in 1966, it made the filing\nof an administrative claim with the appropriate agency a\nprerequisite to filing suit, and it shortened the litigation filing\ndeadline to six months from the agency\u2019s denial of the claim. Act\nof July 18, \u00a7\u00a72(a), 7,80Stat.306,307. But Congress has never\nsuggested that the deadlines could be excused or enlarged by the\ncourts.3The majority relies on the fact that\nwe have allowed equitable tolling under \u201cforever barred\u201d language\nin the Clayton Act. Seeante,at 10. But there is no\nevidence that Congress meant to importthatstatute\u2019s terms\ninto the FTCA. Nor does the Clayton Act involve the waiver of\nsovereign immunity for money damages against the Government. The\nTucker Act, by contrast, was clearly the blueprint for the FTCA\u2019s\ntime bar, itdidinvolve a waiver of sovereign immunity, and\nour cases have uniformly held that its language isnotsubject to equitable tolling.4Even the dissent inBowlesrecognizedIrwin\u2019s irrelevance: It cited the decision only\nwhen discussing equitable exceptions tononjurisdictionalstatutes of limitations. 551 U.\u00a0S., at 219 (opinion of Souter,\nJ.).5We consideredIrwininJohn\nR. Sand & Gravelwhile holding that28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a72501\u2019s time limits are jurisdictional. But we did so only torejectthe suggestion thatIrwincompelled a contrary\nresult. So there, too,Irwin\u2019s presumption did not influence\nthe jurisdictional question. Nor did it influence the outcome inIrwinitself, where we held that equitable tolling was not\navailable.
