JERMAN, PETITIONERv.CARLISLE,\nMc- NELLIE, RINI, KRAMER & ULRICH LPA, et\u00a0al.on writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the sixth circuit[April 21, 2010]Justice Sotomayor delivered the\nopinion of the Court.The Fair Debt Collection\nPractices Act (FDCPA or Act) imposes civil liability on \u201cdebt\ncollector[s]\u201d for certain prohibited debt collection practices.\nSection 813(c) of the Act, 15 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71692k(c), provides\nthat a debt collector is not liable in an action brought under the\nAct if she can show \u201cthe violation was not intentional and resulted\nfrom a bona fide error notwithstanding the maintenance of\nprocedures reasonably adapted to avoid any such error.\u201d This case\npresents the question whether the \u201cbona fide error\u201d defense in\n\u00a71692k(c) applies to a violation resulting from a debt collector\u2019s\nmistaken interpretation of the legal requirements of the FDCPA. We\nconclude it does not.IACongress enacted the FDCPA in\n1977, 91 Stat. 874, to eliminate abusive debt collection practices,\nto ensure that debt collectors who abstain from such practices are\nnot competitively disadvantaged, and to promote consistent state\naction to protect consumers. 15 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71692(e). The Act\nregulates interactions between consumer debtors and \u201cdebt\ncollector[s],\u201d defined to include any person who \u201cregularly\ncollects \u2026 debts owed or due or asserted to be owed or due\nanother.\u201d \u00a7\u00a71692a(5), (6). Among other things, the Act prohibits\ndebt collectors from making false representations as to a debt\u2019s\ncharacter, amount, or legal status, \u00a71692e(2)(A); communicating\nwith consumers at an \u201cunusual time or place\u201d likely to be\ninconvenient to the consumer, \u00a71692c(a)(1); or using obscene or\nprofane language or violence or the threat thereof, \u00a7\u00a71692d(1),\n(2). See generally \u00a7\u00a71692b\u20131692j;Heintzv.Jenkins,514 U. S. 291, 292\u2013293 (1995).The Act is enforced through\nadministrative action and private lawsuits. With some exceptions\nnot relevant here, violations of the FDCPA are deemed to be unfair\nor deceptive acts or practices under the Federal Trade Commission\nAct (FTC Act), 15 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a741et seq., and are\nenforced by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). See\n\u00a71692l. As a result, a debt collector who acts with\n\u201cactual knowledge or knowledge fairly implied on the basis of\nobjective circumstances that such act is [prohibited under the\nFDCPA]\u201d is subject to civil penalties of up to $16,000 per day.\n\u00a7\u00a745(m)(1)(A), (C); 74 Fed. Reg. 858 (2009) (amending 16 CFR\n\u00a71.98(d)).The FDCPA also provides that \u201cany debt\ncollector who fails to comply with any provision of th[e] [Act]\nwith respect to any person is liable to such person.\u201d 15 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a71692k(a). Successful plaintiffs are entitled to \u201cactual\ndamage[s],\u201d plus costs and \u201ca reasonable attorney\u2019s fee as\ndetermined by the court.\u201dIbid.A court may also award\n\u201cadditional damages,\u201d subject to a statutory cap of $1,000 for\nindividual actions, or, for class actions, \u201cthe lesser of $500,000\nor 1 per centum of the net worth of the debt collector.\u201d\n\u00a71692k(a)(2). In awarding additional damages, the court must\nconsider \u201cthe frequency and persistence of [the debt collector\u2019s]\nnoncompliance,\u201d \u201cthe nature of such noncompliance,\u201d and \u201cthe extent\nto which such noncompliance was intentional.\u201d \u00a71692k(b).The Act contains two exceptions to provisions\nimposing liability on debt collectors. Section 1692k(c), at issue\nhere, provides that\u201c[a] debt collector may not be held liable in any\naction brought under [the FDCPA] if the debt collector shows by a\npreponderance of evidence that the violation was not intentional\nand resulted from a bona fide error notwithstanding the maintenance\nof procedures reasonably adapted to avoid any such error.\u201dThe Act also states that none of its provisions\nimposing liability shall apply to \u201cany act done or omitted in good\nfaith in conformity with any advisory opinion of the [Federal\nTrade] Commission.\u201d \u00a71692k(e).BRespondents in this case are a\nlaw firm, Carlisle, McNellie, Rini, Kramer & Ulrich, L. P. A.,\nand one of its attorneys, Adrienne S. Foster (collectively\nCarlisle). In April 2006, Carlisle filed a complaint in Ohio state\ncourt on behalf of a client, Countrywide Home Loans, Inc. Carlisle\nsought foreclosure of a mortgage held by Countrywide in real\nproperty owned by petitioner Karen L. Jerman. The complaint\nincluded a \u201cNotice,\u201d later served on Jerman, stating that the\nmortgage debt would be assumed to be valid unless Jerman disputed\nit in writing. Jerman\u2019s lawyer sent a letter disputing the debt,\nand Carlisle sought verification from Countrywide. When Countrywide\nacknowledged that Jerman had, in fact, already paid the debt in\nfull, Carlisle withdrew the foreclosure lawsuit.Jerman then filed her own lawsuit\nseeking class certification and damages under the FDCPA, contending\nthat Carlisle violated \u00a71692g by stating that her debt would be\nassumed valid unless she disputed it in writing.[Footnote 1] While acknowledging a division of\nauthority on the question, the District Court held that Carlisle\nhad violated \u00a71692g by requiring Jerman to dispute the debt in\nwriting. 464 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d 720, 722\u2013725 (ND Ohio 2006).[Footnote 2] The court ultimately\ngranted summary judgment to Carlisle, however, concluding that\n\u00a71692k(c) shielded it from liability because the violation was not\nintentional, resulted from a bona fide error, and occurred despite\nthe maintenance of procedures reasonably adapted to avoid any such\nerror. 502 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d 686, 695\u2013697 (ND Ohio 2007). The Court\nof Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed. 538 F.\u00a03d 469\n(2008). Acknowledging that the Courts of Appeals are divided\nregarding the scope of the bona fide error defense, and that the\n\u201cmajority view is that the defense is available for clerical and\nfactual errors only,\u201d the Sixth Circuit nonetheless held that\n\u00a71692k(c) extends to \u201cmistakes of law.\u201dId.,at 473\u2013476\n(internal quotation marks omitted). The Court of Appeals found\n\u201cnothing unusual\u201d about attorney debt collectors maintaining\n\u201cprocedures\u201d within the meaning of \u00a71692k(c) to avoid mistakes of\nlaw.Id.,at 476. Noting that a parallel bona fide error\ndefense in the Truth in Lending Act (TILA), 15 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a71640(c), expressly excludes legal errors, the court observed that\nCongress has amended the FDCPA several times since 1977 without\nexcluding mistakes of law from \u00a71692k(c). 538 F.\u00a03d, at\n476.[Footnote 3]We granted certiorari to resolve the conflict\nof authority as to the scope of the FDCPA\u2019s bona fide error\ndefense,[Footnote 4] 557 U. S.\n___ (2009), and now reverse the judgment of the Sixth Circuit.IIAThe parties disagree about\nwhether a \u201cviolation\u201d resulting from a debt collector\u2019s\nmisinterpretation of the legal requirements of the FDCPA can ever\nbe \u201cnot intentional\u201d under \u00a71692k(c). Jerman contends that when a\ndebt collector intentionally commits the act giving rise to the\nviolation (here, sending a notice that included the \u201cin writing\u201d\nlanguage), a misunderstanding about what the Act requires cannot\nrender the violation \u201cnot intentional,\u201d given the general rule that\nmistake or ignorance of law is no defense. Carlisle and the\ndissent, in contrast, argue that nothing in the statutory text\nexcludes legal errors from the category of \u201cbona fide error[s]\u201d\ncovered by \u00a71692k(c) and note that the Act refers not to an\nunintentional \u201cact\u201d but rather an unintentional \u201cviolation.\u201d The\nlatter term, they contend, evinces Congress\u2019 intent to impose\nliability only when a party knows its conduct is unlawful. Carlisle\nurges us, therefore, to read \u00a71692k(c) to encompass \u201call types of\nerror,\u201d including mistakes of law. Brief for Respondents 7.We decline to adopt the expansive\nreading of \u00a71692k(c) that Carlisle proposes. We have long\nrecognized the \u201ccommon maxim, familiar to all minds, that ignorance\nof the law will not excuse any person, either civilly or\ncriminally.\u201dBarlowv.United States, 7 Pet. 404,\n411 (1833) (opinion for the Court by Story, J.); see alsoCheekv.United States,498 U. S. 192, 199 (1991) (\u201cThe\ngeneral rule that ignorance of the law or a mistake of law is no\ndefense to criminal prosecution is deeply rooted in the American\nlegal system\u201d).[Footnote 5] Our\nlaw is therefore no stranger to the possibility that an act may be\n\u201cintentional\u201d for purposes of civil liability, even if the actor\nlacked actual knowledge that her conduct violated the law. InKolstadv.American Dental Assn.,527 U. S. 526(1999),\nfor instance, we addressed a provision of the Civil Rights Act of\n1991 authorizing compensatory and punitive damages for \u201cintentional\ndiscrimination,\u201d 42 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71981a, but limiting punitive\ndamages to conduct undertaken \u201cwith malice or with reckless\nindifference to the federally protected rights of an aggrieved\nindividual,\u201d \u00a71981a(b)(1). We observed that in some circumstances\n\u201cintentional discrimination\u201d could occur without giving rise to\npunitive damages liability, such as where an employer is \u201cunaware\nof the relevant federal prohibition\u201d or acts with the \u201cdistinct\nbelief that its discrimination is lawful.\u201d 527 U. S., at 536\u2013537.\nSee also W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, & D. Owen, Prosser and\nKeeton on Law of Torts 110 (5th ed. 1984) (\u201c[I]f one intentionally\ninterferes with the interests of others, he is often subject to\nliability notwithstanding the invasion was made under an erroneous\nbelief as to some \u2026 legal matter that would have justified the\nconduct\u201d); Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7164, and Commente(1963\u20131964) (intentional tort of trespass can be\ncommitted despite the actor\u2019s mistaken belief that she has a legal\nright to enter the property).[Footnote 6]Likely for this reason, when Congress has\nintended to provide a mistake-of-law defense to civil liability, it\nhas often done so more explicitly than here. In particular, the FTC\nAct\u2019s administrative-penalty provisions\u2014which, as noted above,\nCongress expressly incorporated into the FDCPA\u2014apply only when a\ndebt collector acts with \u201cactual knowledge or knowledge fairly\nimplied on the basis of objective circumstances\u201d that its action\nwas \u201cprohibited by [the FDCPA].\u201d 15 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a745(m)(1)(A),\n(C). Given the absence of similar language in \u00a71692k(c), it is a\nfair inference that Congress chose to permit injured consumers to\nrecover actual damages, costs, fees, and modest statutory damages\nfor \u201cintentional\u201d conduct, including violations resulting from\nmistaken interpretation of the FDCPA, while reserving the more\nonerous penalties of the FTC Act for debt collectors whose\nintentional actions also reflected \u201cknowledge fairly implied on the\nbasis of objective circumstances\u201d that the conduct was prohibited.\nCf. 29 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7260 (authorizing courts to reduce liquidated\ndamages under the Portal-to-Portal Act of 1947 if an employer\ndemonstrates that \u201cthe act or omission giving rise to such action\nwas in good faith and that he had reasonable grounds for believing\nthat his act or omission was not a violation of the Fair Labor\nStandards Act of 1938\u201d); 17 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71203(c)(5)(A) (provision\nof Digital Millennium Copyright Act authorizing court to reduce\ndamages where \u201cthe violator was not aware and had no reason to\nbelieve that its acts constituted a violation\u201d).Congress also did not confine liability under\nthe FDCPA to \u201cwillful\u201d violations, a term more often understood in\nthe civil context to excuse mistakes of law. See,e.g.,Trans World Airlines, Inc.v.Thurston,469 U. S. 111, 125\u2013126\n(1985) (civil damages for \u201cwillful violations\u201d of Age\nDiscrimination in Employment Act of 1967 require a showing that the\nemployer \u201cknew or showed reckless disregard for the matter of\nwhether its conduct was prohibited\u201d (internal quotation marks\nomitted)); cf.Safeco Ins. Co. of Americav.Burr,551 U. S. 47, 57 (2007) (although\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018willfully\u2019\u00a0\u201d is a \u201c\u00a0\u2018word of many\nmeanings\u2019\u00a0\u201d dependent on context, \u201cwe have generally taken it\n[when used as a statutory condition of civil liability] to cover\nnot only knowing violations of a standard, but reckless ones as\nwell\u201d (quotingBryanv.United States,524 U. S. 184, 191 (1998)). For this\nreason, the dissent missteps in relying onThurstonandMcLaughlinv.Richland Shoe Co.,486 U. S. 128, 133\n(1988), as both cases involved the statutory phrase \u201cwillful\nviolation.\u201dPost, at 3.The dissent reaches a contrary conclusion\nbased on the interaction of the words \u201cviolation\u201d and \u201cnot\nintentional\u201d in \u00a71692k(c).Post, at 2\u20133. But even in the\ncriminal context, cf. n.\u00a06,supra, reference to a\n\u201cknowing\u201d or \u201cintentional\u201d \u201cviolation\u201d or cognate terms has not\nnecessarily implied a defense for legal errors. SeeBryanv.United States,524 U. S. 184, 192 (1998)\n(\u201c\u00a0\u2018[T]he knowledge requisite to knowing violation of a\nstatute is factual knowledge as distinguished from knowledge of the\nlaw\u2019\u00a0\u201d (quotingBoyce Motor Lines, Inc.v.United\nStates,342 U.\nS. 337, 345 (1952) (Jackson, J., dissenting));United\nStatesv.International Minerals & Chemical\nCorp.,402 U.\nS. 558, 559, 563 (1971) (statute imposing criminal liability on\nthose who \u201c\u00a0\u2018knowingly violat[e]\u2019\u00a0\u201d regulations governing\ntransportation of corrosive chemicals does not require \u201cproof of\n[the defendant\u2019s] knowledge of the law\u201d);Ellisv.United States,206 U. S. 246, 255, 257 (1907)\n(rejecting argument that criminal penalty applicable to those who\n\u201cintentionally violate\u201d a statute \u201crequires knowledge of the\nlaw\u201d).The dissent advances a novel interpretative\nrule under which the combination of a \u201cmens rearequirement\u201d and the word \u201c\u00a0\u2018violation\u2019\u00a0\u201d (as opposed to\nlanguage specifying \u201cthe conduct giving rise to the violation\u201d)\ncreates a mistake-of-law defense.Post, at 2\u20133. Such a\nrule would be remarkable in its breadth, applicable to the many\nscores of civil and criminal provisions throughout the U. S. Code\nthat employ such a combination of terms. The dissent\u2019s theory draws\nno distinction between \u201cknowing,\u201d \u201cintentional,\u201d or \u201cwillful\u201d and\nwould abandon the care we have traditionally taken to construe such\nwords in their particular statutory context. See,e.g.,Safeco,supra, at 57. More fundamentally, the\ndissent\u2019s categorical rule is at odds with precedents such asBryan,supra, at 192, andInternational\nMinerals,supra, at 559, 563, in which we rejected a\nmistake-of-law defense when a statute imposed liability for a\n\u201cknowing violation\u201d or on those who \u201cknowingly violat[e]\u201d the\nlaw.[Footnote 7]The dissent posits that the word\n\u201cintentional,\u201d in the civil context, requires a higher showing ofmens reathan \u201cwillful\u201d and thus that it should be easier\nto avoid liability for intentional, rather than willful,\nviolations.Post, at 4. Even if the dissent is correct\nthat the phrase \u201cintentional violation,\u201d standing alone in a civil\nliability statute, might be read to excuse mistakes of law, the\nFDCPA juxtaposes the term \u201cnot intentional\u201d \u201cviolation\u201d in\n\u00a71692k(c) with the more specific language of \u00a745(m)(1)(A), which\nrefers to \u201cactual knowledge or knowledge fairly implied on the\nbasis of objective circumstances\u201d that particular conduct was\nunlawful. The dissent\u2019s reading gives short shrift to that textual\ndistinction.We draw additional support for the conclusion\nthat bona fide errors in \u00a71692k(c) do not include mistaken\ninterpretations of the FDCPA, from the requirement that a debt\ncollector maintain \u201cprocedures reasonably adapted to avoid any such\nerror.\u201d The dictionary defines \u201cprocedure\u201d as \u201ca series of steps\nfollowed in a regular orderly definite way.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New\nInternational Dictionary 1807 (1976). In that light, the statutory\nphrase is more naturally read to apply to processes that have\nmechanical or other such \u201cregular orderly\u201d steps to avoid\nmistakes\u2014for instance, the kind of internal controls a debt\ncollector might adopt to ensure its employees do not communicate\nwith consumers at the wrong time of day, \u00a71692c(a)(1), or make\nfalse representations as to the amount of a debt, \u00a71692e(2). The\ndissent, like the Court of Appeals, finds nothing unusual in\nattorney debt collectors maintaining procedures to avoid legal\nerror.Post, at 18; 538 F.\u00a03d, at 476. We do not\ndispute that some entities may maintain procedures to avoid legal\nerrors. But legal reasoning is not a mechanical or strictly linear\nprocess. For this reason, we find force in the suggestion by the\nGovernment (asamicus curiaesupporting Jerman) that the\nbroad statutory requirement of procedures reasonably designed to\navoid \u201cany\u201d bona fide error indicates that the relevant procedures\nare ones that help to avoid errors like clerical or factual\nmistakes. Such procedures are more likely to avoid error than those\napplicable to legal reasoning, particularly in the context of a\ncomprehensive and complex federal statute such as the FDCPA that\nimposes open-ended prohibitions on,inter alia,\u201cfalse,\ndeceptive,\u201d \u00a71692e, or \u201cunfair\u201d practices, \u00a71692f. See Brief for\nUnited States asAmicus Curiae16\u201318.Even if the text of \u00a71692k(c), read in\nisolation, leaves room for doubt, the context and history of the\nFDCPA provide further reinforcement for construing that provision\nnot to shield violations resulting from misinterpretations of the\nrequirements of the Act. SeeDadav.Mukasey,554 U. S. 1, __\n(2008) (slip op., at 13) (\u201cIn reading a statute we must not look\nmerely to a particular clause, but consider in connection with it\nthe whole statute\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). As\ndescribed above, Congress included in the FDCPA not only the bona\nfide error defense but also a separate protection from liability\nfor \u201cany act done or omitted in good faith in conformity with any\nadvisory opinion of the [FTC].\u201d \u00a71692k(e). In our view, the Court\nof Appeals\u2019 reading is at odds with the role Congress evidently\ncontemplated for the FTC in resolving ambiguities in the Act. Debt\ncollectors would rarely need to consult the FTC if \u00a71692k(c) were\nread to offer immunity for good-faith reliance on advice from\nprivate counsel. Indeed, debt collectors might have an affirmative\nincentive not to seek an advisory opinion to resolve ambiguity in\nthe law, as receipt of such advice would prevent them from claiming\ngood-faith immunity for violations and would potentially trigger\ncivil penalties for knowing violations under the FTC Act.[Footnote 8] More importantly, the\nexistence of a separate provision that, by its plain terms, is more\nobviously tailored to the concern at issue (excusing civil\nliability when the Act\u2019s prohibitions are uncertain) weighs against\nstretching the language of the bona fide error defense to\naccommodate Carlisle\u2019s expansive reading.[Footnote 9]Any remaining doubt about the proper\ninterpretation of \u00a71692k(c) is dispelled by evidence of the meaning\nattached to the language Congress copied into the FDCPA\u2019s bona fide\nerror defense from a parallel provision in an existing statute.\nTILA, 82 Stat. 146, was the first of several statutes collectively\nknown as the Consumer Credit Protection Act (CCPA) that now include\nthe FDCPA. As enacted in 1968, \u00a7130(c) of TILA provided an\naffirmative defense that was in pertinent part identical to the\nprovision Congress later enacted into the FDCPA: \u201cA creditor may\nnot be held liable in any action brought under [TILA] if the\ncreditor shows by a preponderance of evidence that the violation\nwas not intentional and resulted from a bona fide error\nnotwithstanding the maintenance of procedures reasonably adapted to\navoid any such error.\u201d 82 Stat. 157 (codified at 15 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a71640(c)).During the 9-year period between the enactment\nof TILA and passage of the FDCPA, the three Federal Courts of\nAppeals to consider the question interpreted TILA\u2019s bona fide error\ndefense as referring to clerical errors; no such court interpreted\nTILA to extend to violations resulting from a mistaken legal\ninterpretation of that Act.[Footnote 10] We have often observed that when \u201cjudicial\ninterpretations have settled the meaning of an existing statutory\nprovision, repetition of the same language in a new statute\nindicates, as a general matter, the intent to incorporate its \u2026\njudicial interpretations as well.\u201dBragdonv.Abbott,524\nU. S. 624, 645 (1998); see alsoRowev.New\nHampshire Motor Transp. Assn.,552 U. S. 364, 370\n(2008). While the interpretations of three Federal Courts of\nAppeals may not have \u201csettled\u201d the meaning of TILA\u2019s bona fide\nerror defense, there is no reason to suppose that Congress\ndisagreed with those interpretations when it enacted the FDCPA.\nCongress copied verbatim the pertinent portions of TILA\u2019s bona fide\nerror defense into the FDCPA. Compare 15 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71640(c)\n(1976 ed.) with \u00a7813(c), 91 Stat. 881. This close textual\ncorrespondence supports an inference that Congress understood the\nstatutory formula it chose for the FDCPA consistent with Federal\nCourt of Appeals interpretations of TILA.[Footnote 11]Carlisle and the dissent urge reliance,\nconsistent with the approach taken by the Court of Appeals, on a\n1980 amendment to TILA that added the following sentence to that\nstatute\u2019s bona fide error defense: \u201cExamples of a bona fide error\ninclude, but are not limited to, clerical, calculation, computer\nmalfunction and program[m]ing, and printing errors, except that an\nerror of legal judgment with respect to a person\u2019s obligations\nunder [TILA] is not a bona fide error.\u201d See Truth in Lending\nSimplification and Reform Act, \u00a7615, 94 Stat. 181. The absence of a\ncorresponding amendment to the FDCPA, Carlisle reasons, is evidence\nof Congress\u2019 intent to give a more expansive scope to the FDCPA\ndefense. For several reasons, we decline to give the 1980 TILA\namendment such interpretative weight. For one, it is not obvious\nthat the amendment changed the scope of TILA\u2019s bona fide error\ndefense in a way material to our analysis, given the uniform\ninterpretations of three Courts of Appeals holding that the TILA\ndefense does not extend to mistakes of law.[Footnote 12] (Contrary to the dissent\u2019s\nsuggestion,post, at 21, this reading does not render the\n1980 amendment surplusage. Congress may simply have intended to\ncodify existing judicial interpretations to remove any potential\nfor doubt in jurisdictions where courts had not yet addressed the\nissue.) It is also unclear why Congress would have intended the\nFDCPA\u2019s defense to be broader than the one in TILA, which presents\nat least as significant a set of concerns about imposing liability\nfor uncertain legal obligations. See,e.g.,Ford Motor\nCredit Co.v.Milhollin,444 U. S. 555, 566 (1980) (TILA is\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018highly technical\u2019\u00a0\u201d). Our reluctance to give\ncontrolling weight to the TILA amendment in construing the FDCPA is\nreinforced by the fact that Congress has not expresslyincludedmistakes of law in any of the numerous bona fide\nerror defenses, worded in pertinent part identically to \u00a71692k(c),\nelsewhere in the U. S. Code. Compare,e.g.,12 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a74010(c)(2) (bona fide error defense in Expedited Funds\nAvailability Act expressly excluding \u201can error of legal judgment\nwith respect to [obligations under that Act]\u201d) with 15 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a71693m(c), 1693h(c) (bona fide error provisions in the\nElectronic Fund Transfer Act that are silent as to errors of legal\njudgment).[Footnote 13]\nAlthough Carlisle points out that Congress has amended the FDCPA on\nseveral occasions without expressly restricting the scope of\n\u00a71692k(c), that does not suggest Congress viewed the statute as\nhaving the expansive reading Carlisle advances, particularly as not\nuntil recently had a Court of Appeals interpreted the bona fide\nerror defense to include a violation of the FDCPA resulting from a\nmistake of law. SeeJohnsonv.Riddle, 305\nF.\u00a03d 1107, 1121\u20131124, and nn.\u00a014\u201315 (CA10 2002).Carlisle\u2019s reliance onHeintz,514 U. S. 291, is also unavailing. We\nheld in that case that the FDCPA\u2019s definition of \u201cdebt collector\u201d\nincludes lawyers who regularly, through litigation, attempt to\ncollect consumer debts.Id.,at 292. We addressed a\nconcern raised by the petitioner (as here, a lawyer collecting a\ndebt on behalf of a client) that our reading would automatically\nrender liable \u201cany litigating lawyer who brought, and then lost, a\nclaim against a debtor,\u201d on the ground that \u00a71692e(5) prohibits a\ndebt collector from making any \u201c\u00a0\u2018threat to take action that\ncannot legally be taken.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId.,at 295. We expressed\nskepticism that \u00a71692e(5) itself demanded such a result. But even\nassuming the correctness of petitioner\u2019s reading of \u00a71692e(5), we\nsuggested that the availability of the bona fide error defense\nmeant that the prospect of liability for litigating lawyers was not\n\u201cso absurd\u201d as to warrant implying a categorical exemption\nunsupported by the statutory text.Ibid.We had no\noccasion inHeintzto address the overall scope of the\nbona fide error defense. Our discussion of \u00a71692e(5) did not depend\non the premise that a misinterpretation of the requirements of the\nAct would fall under the bona fide error defense. In the mine-run\nlawsuit, a lawyer is at least as likely to be unsuccessful because\nof factual deficiencies as opposed to legal error. Lawyers can, of\ncourse, invoke \u00a71692k(c) for violations resulting from qualifying\nfactual errors.Carlisle\u2019s remaining arguments do not change\nour view of \u00a71692k(c). Carlisle perceives an inconsistency between\nour reading of the term \u201cintentional\u201d in that provision and the\ninstruction in \u00a71692k(b) that a court look to whether\n\u201cnoncompliance was intentional\u201d in assessing statutory additional\ndamages. But assuming \u00a71692k(b) encompasses errors of law, we see\nno conflict, only congruence, in reading the Act to permit a court\nto adjust statutory damages for a good-faith misinterpretation of\nlaw, even where a debt collector is not entitled to the categorical\nprotection of the bona fide error defense. Carlisle is also\nconcerned that under our reading, \u00a71692k(c) would be unavailable to\na debt collector who violates a provision of the FDCPA applying to\nacts taken with particular intent because in such instances the\nrelevant act would not be unintentional. See,e.g.,\u00a71692d(5) (prohibiting a debt collector from \u201c[c]ausing a telephone\nto ring \u2026 continuously with intent to annoy, abuse, or harass\u201d).\nIncluding mistakes as to the scope of such a prohibition, Carlisle\nurges, would ensure that \u00a71692k(c) applied throughout the FDCPA. We\nsee no reason, however, why the bona fide error defense must cover\nevery provision of the Act.The parties andamicimake arguments\nconcerning the legislative history that we address for the sake of\ncompleteness. Carlisle points to a sentence in a Senate Committee\nReport stating that \u201c[a] debt collector has no liability \u2026 if he\nviolates the act in any manner, including with regard to the act\u2019s\ncoverage, when such violation is unintentional and occurred despite\nprocedures designed to avoid such violations.\u201d S.\u00a0Rep. No.\n95\u2013382, p. 5 (1977); see alsopost, at 4\u20136 (opinion of\nScalia, J.) (discussing report). But by its own terms, the quoted\nsentence does not unambiguously support Carlisle\u2019s reading. Even if\na bona fide mistake \u201cwith regard to the act\u2019s coverage\u201d could be\nread in isolation to contemplate a mistake of law, that reading\ndoes not exclude mistakes of fact. A mistake \u201cwith regard to the\nact\u2019s coverage\u201d may derive wholly from a debt collector\u2019s factually\nmistaken belief, for example, that a particular debt arose out of a\nnonconsumer transaction and was therefore not \u201ccovered\u201d by the Act.\nThere is no reason to read this passing statement in the Senate\nReport as contemplating an exemption for legal error that is the\nproduct of an attorney\u2019s erroneous interpretation of the\nFDCPA\u2014particularly when attorneys were excluded from the Act\u2019s\ndefinition of \u201cdebt collector\u201d until 1986. 100 Stat. 768. Moreover,\nthe reference to \u201cany manner\u201d of violation is expressly qualified\nby the requirements that the violation be \u201cunintentional\u201d and occur\ndespite maintenance of appropriate procedures. In any event, we\nneed not choose between these possible readings of the Senate\nReport, as the legislative record taken as a whole does not lend\nstrong support to Carlisle\u2019s view.[Footnote 14] We therefore decline to give controlling\nweight to this isolated passage.BCarlisle, itsamici, and\nthe dissent raise the additional concern that our reading will have\nunworkable practical consequences for debt collecting lawyers. See,e.g.,Brief for Respondents 40\u201341, 45\u201348; NARCA Brief\n4\u201316;post, at 5\u201314. Carlisle claims the FDCPA\u2019s private\nenforcement provisions have fostered a \u201ccottage industry\u201d of\nprofessional plaintiffs who sue debt collectors for trivial\nviolations of the Act. See Brief for Respondents 40\u201341. If debt\ncollecting attorneys can be held personally liable for their\nreasonable misinterpretations of the requirements of the Act,\nCarlisle and itsamiciforesee a flood of lawsuits against\ncreditors\u2019 lawyers by plaintiffs (and their attorneys) seeking\ndamages and attorney\u2019s fees. The threat of such liability, in the\ndissent\u2019s view, creates an irreconcilable conflict between an\nattorney\u2019s personal financial interest and her ethical obligation\nof zealous advocacy on behalf of a client: An attorney uncertain\nabout what the FDCPA requires must choose between, on the one hand,\nexposing herself to liability and, on the other, resolving the\nlegal ambiguity against her client\u2019s interest or advising the\nclient to settle\u2014even where there is substantial legal authority\nfor a position favoring the client.Post, at\n10\u201314.[Footnote 15]We do not believe our holding\ntoday portends such grave consequences. For one, the FDCPA contains\nseveral provisions that expressly guard against abusive lawsuits,\nthereby mitigating the financial risk to creditors\u2019 attorneys. When\nan alleged violation is trivial, the \u201cactual damage[s]\u201d sustained,\n\u00a71692k(a)(1), will likely bede minimisor even zero. The\nAct sets a cap on \u201cadditional\u201d damages, \u00a71692k(a)(2), and vests\ncourts with discretion to adjust such damages where a violation is\nbased on a good-faith error, \u00a71692k(b). Oneamicussuggests that attorney\u2019s fees may shape financial incentives even\nwhere actual and statutory damages are modest. NARCA Brief 11. The\nstatute does contemplate an award of costs and \u201ca reasonable\nattorney\u2019s fee as determined by the court\u201d in the case of \u201cany\nsuccessful action to enforce the foregoing liability.\u201d\n\u00a71692k(a)(3). But courts have discretion in calculating reasonable\nattorney\u2019s fees under this statute,[Footnote 16] and \u00a71692k(a)(3) authorizes courts to award\nattorney\u2019s fees to the defendant if a plaintiff\u2019s suit \u201cwas brought\nin bad faith and for the purpose of harassment.\u201dLawyers also have recourse to the affirmative\ndefense in \u00a71692k(c). Not every uncertainty presented in litigation\nstems from interpretation of the requirements of the Act itself;\nlawyers may invoke the bona fide error defense, for instance, where\na violation results from a qualifying factual error. Jerman and the\nGovernment suggest that lawyers can entirely avoid the risk of\nmisinterpreting the Act by obtaining an advisory opinion from the\nFTC under \u00a71692k(e). Carlisle fairly observes that the FTC has not\nfrequently issued such opinions, and that the average processing\ntime may present practical difficulties. Indeed, the Government\ninformed us at oral argument that the FTC has issued only four\nopinions in the past decade (in response to seven requests), and\nthe FTC\u2019s response time has typically been three or four months.\nTr. of Oral Arg. 27\u201328, 30. Without disregarding the possibility\nthat the FTC advisory opinion process might be useful in some\ncases, evidence of present administrative practice makes us\nreluctant to place significant weight on \u00a71692k(e) as a practical\nremedy for the concerns Carlisle has identified.We are unpersuaded by what seems an implicit\npremise of Carlisle\u2019s arguments: that the bona fide error defense\nis a debt collector\u2019s sole recourse to avoid potential liability.\nWe addressed a similar argument inHeintz, in which the\npetitioner urged that certain of the Act\u2019s substantive provisions\nwould generate \u201c\u00a0\u2018anomalies\u2019\u00a0\u201d if the term \u201cdebt\ncollector\u201d was read to include litigating lawyers. 514 U. S., at\n295. Among other things, the petitioner inHeintzcontended that \u00a71692c(c)\u2019s bar on further communication with a\nconsumer who notifies a debt collector that she is refusing to pay\nthe debt would prohibit a lawyer from filing a lawsuit to collect\nthe debt.Id.,at 296\u2013297. We agreed it would be \u201codd\u201d if\nthe Act interfered in this way with \u201can ordinary debt-collecting\nlawsuit\u201d but suggested \u00a71692c(c) did not demand such a reading in\nlight of several exceptions in the text of that provision itself.Ibid.As inHeintz, we need not authoritatively\ninterpret the Act\u2019s conduct-regulating provisions to observe that\nthose provisions should not be assumed to compel absurd results\nwhen applied to debt collecting attorneys.To the extent the FDCPA imposes some\nconstraints on a lawyer\u2019s advocacy on behalf of a client, it is\nhardly unique in our law. \u201c[A]n attorney\u2019s ethical duty to advance\nthe interests of his client is limited by an equally solemn duty to\ncomply with the law and standards of professional conduct.\u201dNixv.Whiteside,475 U. S. 157, 168\n(1986). Lawyers face sanctions, among other things, for suits\npresented \u201cfor any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause\nunnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of litigation.\u201d\nFed. Rules Civ. Proc. 11(b), (c). Model rules of professional\nconduct adopted by many States impose outer bounds on an attorney\u2019s\npursuit of a client\u2019s interests. See,e.g.,ABA Model\nRules of Professional Conduct 3.1 (2009) (requiring nonfrivolous\nbasis in law and fact for claims asserted); 4.1 (truthfulness to\nthird parties). In some circumstances, lawyers may face personal\nliability for conduct undertaken during representation of a client.\nSee,e.g.,Central Bank of Denver, N. A.v.First Interstate Bank of Denver, N. A.,511 U. S. 164, 191\n(1994) (\u201cAny person or entity, including a lawyer, \u2026 who employs a\nmanipulative device or makes a material misstatement (or omission)\non which a purchaser or seller of securities relies may be liable\nas a primary violator under [Securities and Exchange Commission\nRule] 10b\u20135\u201d).Moreover, a lawyer\u2019s interest in avoiding\nFDCPA liability may not always be adverse to her client. Some\ncourts have held clients vicariously liable for their lawyers\u2019\nviolations of the FDCPA. See,e.g.,Foxv.Citicorp Credit Servs., Inc., 15 F.\u00a03d 1507, 1516\n(CA9 1994); see alsoFirst Interstate Bank of Fort Collins,\nN.\u00a0A.v.Soucie, 924 P.\u00a02d 1200, 1202\n(Colo. App. 1996).The suggestion that our reading of \u00a71692k(c)\nwill create unworkable consequences is also undermined by the\nexistence of numerous state consumer protection and debt collection\nstatutes that contain bona fide error defenses that are either\nsilent as to, or expressly exclude, legal errors.[Footnote 17] Several States have enacted\ndebt collection statutes that contain neither an exemption for\nattorney debt collectors nor any bona fide error defense at all.\nSee,e.g.,Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 93, \u00a749 (West 2008); Md.\nCom. Law Code Ann. \u00a714\u2013203 (Lexis 2005); Ore. Rev. Stat. \u00a7646.641\n(2007); Wis. Stat. \u00a7427.105 (2007\u20132008). More generally, a group of\n21 States asamicisupporting Jerman inform us they are\naware of \u201cno [judicial] decisions interpreting a parallel state\nbona fide error provision [in a civil regulatory statute] to\nimmunize a defendant\u2019s mistake of law,\u201d except in a minority of\nstatutes that expressly provide to the contrary.[Footnote 18] See Brief for State of New\nYork et\u00a0al. asAmici Curiae11, and n.\u00a06.\nNeither Carlisle and itsamicinor the dissent demonstrate\nthat lawyers have suffered drastic consequences under these state\nregimes.In the dissent\u2019s view, these policy concerns\nare evidence that \u201cCongress could not have intended\u201d the reading we\nadopt today.Post, at 5. But the dissent\u2019s reading raises\nconcerns of its own. The dissent focuses on the facts of this case,\nin which an attorney debt collector, in the dissent\u2019s view, \u201cacted\nreasonably at every step\u201d and committed a \u201ctechnical violation\u201d\nresulting in no \u201cactual harm\u201d to the debtor.Post,at 12,\n6, 8. But the dissent\u2019s legal theory does not limit the defense to\nattorney debt collectors or \u201ctechnical\u201d violations.[Footnote 19] Under that approach, it\nappears, nonlawyer debt collectors could obtain blanket immunity\nfor mistaken interpretations of the FDCPA simply by seeking the\nadvice of legal counsel. Moreover, many debt collectors are\ncompensated with a percentage of money recovered, and so will have\na financial incentive to press the boundaries of the Act\u2019s\nprohibitions on collection techniques. It is far from obvious why\nimmunizing debt collectors who adopt aggressive but mistaken\ninterpretations of the law would be consistent with the statute\u2019s\nbroadly worded prohibitions on debt collector misconduct. Jerman\nand heramiciexpress further concern that the dissent\u2019s\nreading would give a competitive advantage to debt collectors who\npress the boundaries of lawful conduct. They foresee a \u201crace to the\nbottom\u201d driving ethical collectors out of business. Brief for\nPetitioner 32; Brief for Public Citizen et\u00a0al. asAmici\nCuriae16\u201318. It is difficult to square such a result with\nCongress\u2019 express purpose \u201cto eliminate abusive debt collection\npractices by debt collectors, [and] to insure that those debt\ncollectors who refrain from using abusive debt collection practices\nare not competitively disadvantaged,\u201d \u00a71692(e).The dissent\u2019s reading also invites litigation\nabout a debt collector\u2019s subjective intent to violate the FDCPA and\nthe adequacy of procedures maintained to avoid legal error. Cf.Barlow, 7 Pet., at 411 (maxim that ignorance of the law\nwill not excuse civil or criminal liability \u201cresults from the\nextreme difficulty of ascertaining what is, bona fide, the\ninterpretation of the party\u201d). Courts that read \u00a71692k(c) to permit\na mistake-of-law defense have adopted varying formulations of what\nlegal procedures are \u201creasonably adapted to avoid any [legal]\nerror.\u201d[Footnote 20] Among\nother uncertainties, the dissent does not explain whether it would\nread \u00a71692k(c) to impose a heightened standard for the procedures\nattorney debt collectors must maintain, as compared to nonattorney\ndebt collectors. The increased cost to prospective plaintiffs in\ntime, fees, and uncertainty of outcome may chill private suits\nunder the statutory right of action, undermining the FDCPA\u2019s\ncalibrated scheme of statutory incentives to encourage\nself-enforcement. Cf. FTC, Collecting Consumer Debts: The Challenge\nof Change 67 (2009) (\u201cBecause the Commission receives more than\n70,000 third-party debt collection complaints per year, it is not\nfeasible for federal government law enforcement to be the exclusive\nor primary means of deterring all possible law violations\u201d). The\nstateamicipredict that, on the dissent\u2019s reading,\nconsumers will have little incentive to bring enforcement actions\n\u201cwhere the law [i]s at all unsettled, because in such circumstances\na debt collector could easily claim bona fide error of law\u201d; in the\nStates\u2019 view, the resulting \u201cenforcement gap\u201d would be \u201cextensive\u201d\nat both the federal and State levels. See Brief for State of New\nYork et\u00a0al. asAmici Curiae7\u201310. In short, the\npolicy concerns identified by the dissent tell only half the\nstory.[Footnote 21]In sum, we do not foresee that our decision\ntoday will place unmanageable burdens on lawyers practicing in the\ndebt collection industry. To the extent debt collecting lawyers\nface liability for mistaken interpretations of the requirements of\nthe FDCPA, Carlisle, itsamici, and the dissent have not\nshown that \u201cthe result [will be] so absurd as to warrant\u201d\ndisregarding the weight of textual authority discussed above.Heintz, 514 U. S., at 295. Absent such a showing,\narguments that the Act strikes an undesirable balance in assigning\nthe risks of legal misinterpretation are properly addressed to\nCongress. To the extent Congress is persuaded that the policy\nconcerns identified by the dissent require a recalibration of the\nFDCPA\u2019s liability scheme, it is, of course, free to amend the\nstatute accordingly.[Footnote\n22] Congress has wide latitude, for instance, to revise \u00a71692k\nto excuse some or all mistakes of law or grant broader discretion\nto district courts to adjust a plaintiff\u2019s recovery. This Court may\nnot, however, read more into \u00a71692k(c) than the statutory language\nnaturally supports. We therefore hold that the bona fide error\ndefense in \u00a71692k(c) does not apply to a violation of the FDCPA\nresulting from a debt collector\u2019s incorrect interpretation of the\nrequirements of that statute.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*For the reasons discussed above,\nthe judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth\nCircuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.Footnote 1Section 1692g(a)(3) requires a debt\ncollector, within five days of an \u201cinitial communication\u201d about the\ncollection of a debt, to send the consumer a written notice\ncontaining,inter alia, \u201ca statement that unless the\nconsumer, within thirty days after receipt of the notice, disputes\nthe validity of the debt, or any portion thereof, the debt will be\nassumed to be valid by the debt collector.\u201dFootnote 2The District Court distinguished, for\ninstance,Grazianov.Harrison, 950 F.\u00a02d\n107, 112 (CA3 1991), which held a consumer\u2019s dispute of a debt\nunder \u00a71692g must be in writing to be effective. Noting that\ndistrict courts within the Sixth Circuit had reached different\nresults, and distinguishing one unpublished Sixth Circuit decision\nwhich Carlisle suggested approved a form with an in-writing\nrequirement, the court adopted the reasoning fromCamachov.Bridgeport Financial, Inc., 430 F.\u00a03d 1078,\n1080\u20131082 (CA9 2005), and held that the plain language of \u00a71692g\ndoes not impose an \u201cin writing\u201d requirement on consumers. See 464\nF.\u00a0Supp. 2d, at 725.Footnote 3Because the question was not raised on\nappeal, the Court of Appeals did not address whether Carlisle\u2019s\ninclusion of the \u201cin writing\u201d requirement violated \u00a71692g. 538\nF.\u00a03d, at 472, n.\u00a02. We likewise express no view about\nwhether inclusion of an \u201cin writing\u201d requirement in a notice to a\nconsumer violates \u00a71692g, as that question was not presented in the\npetition for certiorari. CompareGraziano,supra,\nat 112 (reading \u00a71692g(a)(3) to require that \u201cany dispute, to be\neffective, must be in writing\u201d), withCamacho,supra, at 1082 (under \u00a71692g(a)(3), \u201cdisputes need not be\nmade in writing\u201d).Footnote 4Compare,e.g., 538 F.\u00a03d, at\n476 (case below), withBakerv.G.

S.\u00a0C. \u00a71692k(c) applies to\nviolations of the FDCPA resulting from a misinterpretation of the\nrequirements of state law. CompareJohnsonv.Riddle, 305 F.\u00a03d 1107, 1121 (CA10 2002) (concluding\nthat \u00a71692k(c) applies where a debt collector\u2019s misinterpretation\nof a Utah dishonored check statute resulted in a violation of\n\u00a71692f(1), which prohibits collection of any amount not \u201cpermitted\nby law\u201d), withPichtv.Jon R.

The parties\ndisagree about whether \u00a71692k(c) applies when a violation results\nfrom a debt collector\u2019s misinterpretation of the legal requirements\nof state law or federal law other than the FDCPA. Compare Brief for\nPetitioner 47\u201349, with Brief for Respondents 60\u201362. Because this\ncase involves only an alleged misinterpretation of the requirements\nof the FDCPA, we need not, and do not, reach those other\nquestions.Footnote 5The dissent discounts the relevance of the\nprinciple here, on grounds that this case involves the scope of a\nstatutory exception to liability, rather than a provision\n\u201cdelineat[ing] a category of prohibited conduct.\u201dPost, at\n15 (opinion of Kennedy, J.). That is a distinction without a\ndifference, as our precedents have made clear for more than 175\nyears.Barlowinvolved a statute providing for forfeiture\nof any goods entered \u201cby a false denomination\u201d in the office of a\ncustoms collector \u201cfor the benefit of drawback or bounty upon the\nexportation\u201d; the statute included, however, an exception under\nwhich \u201csaid forfeiture shall not be incurred, if it shall be made\nappear \u2026 that such false denomination \u2026 happened by mistake or\naccident, and not from any intention to defraud the revenue.\u201d 7\nPet., at 406; see also Act of Mar. 2, 1799, \u00a784, 1 Stat. 694.

But the Court declined to resolve the case on\nthe ground of the shipper\u2019s intent, instead invoking the \u201ccommon\nmaxim, familiar to all minds, that ignorance of the law will not\nexcuse any person, either civilly or criminally.\u201dIbid.Notwithstanding the existence of a statutory exception\u2014which did\nnot expressly exclude legal errors from the category of\n\u201cmistake[s]\u201d made without \u201cintention to defraud\u201d\u2014the Court saw \u201cnot\nthe least reason to suppose that the legislature, in this\nenactment, had any intention to supersede the common principle.\u201dIbid.The dissent impliesBarlowis too old to be relevant.Post, at 16. But at least in the context ofstare\ndecisis, this Court has suggested precedents tend to gain, not\nlose, respect with age. SeeMontejov.Louisiana,\n556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 13). In any event, Justice\nStory\u2019s opinion for a unanimous Court inBarlowis hardly\na relic. As recently as 1994 this Court cited it for the \u201cvenerable\nprinciple\u201d that ignorance of the law generally is no defense.Ratzlafv.United States,510 U. S. 135, 149; see\nalsoCheekv.United States,498 U. S. 192, 199 (1991) (citingBarlowfor a similar proposition).Footnote 6Different considerations apply, of course, in\ninterpreting criminal statutes.Safeco Ins. Co. of Americav.Burr,551 U. S. 47, 57\u201358, n.\u00a09 (2007).\nBut even in that context, we have not consistently required\nknowledge that the offending conduct is unlawful. See,e.g.,Ellisv.United States,206 U. S. 246, 255, 257 (1907)\n(observing, in the context of a statute imposing liability for\n\u201cintentiona[l] violat[ions],\u201d that \u201c[i]f a man intentionally adopts\ncertain conduct in certain circumstances known to him, and that\nconduct is forbidden by the law under those circumstances, he\nintentionally breaks the law in the only sense in which the law\never considers intent\u201d).Footnote 7Indeed, inInternational Minerals,\nthe Court faced, and evidently rejected, the distinction the\ndissent would draw today between the term \u201c\u00a0\u2018violation\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nand a reference to \u201cthe conduct giving rise to the violation.\u201dPost, at 3. As noted, inInternational Minerals,\nthe Court rejected a mistake-of-law defense for a statute that\napplied to those who \u201cknowingly violat[e]\u201d certain regulations. 402\nU. S., at 559, 563. In so doing, however, we expressly acknowledged\nthe contrary view adopted by one lower court opinion that knowledge\nof the regulations was necessary.Id.,at 562 (citingSt. Johnsbury Trucking Co.v.United States, 220\nF.\u00a02d 393, 397 (CA1 1955) (Magruder, C.\u00a0J., concurring)).\nThe dissenting opinion inInternational Mineralsquoted\nextensively portions of theSt. Johnsburyconcurrence that\nreached its result by contrasting a statute making it an offense\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018\u00a0\u201cknowingly\u201d to sell adulterated milk\u2019\u00a0\u201d with one\nthat makes it an offense \u201c\u00a0\u2018knowingly [to] violat[e] a\nregulation.\u2019\u00a0\u201d 402 U.

Cf.post, at 3 (Kennedy, J., dissenting).\nConcluding that a mistake-of-law defense is available under a\nprovision that specifies particular conduct undertaken while\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018knowing\u2019\u00a0\u201d that food stamp coupons had been\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018used in any manner in violation of [law],\u2019\u00a0\u201d 471 U.\nS., at 428, n.\u00a012, says little about the meaning of a \u201cnot\nintentional\u201d \u201cviolation\u201d in 15 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71692k(c). Indeed, the\nstatute inLiparotabears a closer resemblance to the\nadministrative penalty provision in \u00a745(m)(1)(A). Seesupra, at 8\u20139.Footnote 8One of Carlisle\u2019samicisuggests the\nFTC safe harbor would provide a more categorical immunity than\n\u00a71692k(c), obviating the need,e.g., to maintain\n\u201cprocedures reasonably adapted to avoid any such error.\u201d Brief for\nNational Association of Retail Collection Attorneys asAmicus\nCuriae18\u201319 (NARCA Brief). Even if that is true, we need not\nconclude that the FTC safe harbor would be rendered entirely\nsuperfluous to reason that the existence of that provision counsels\nagainst extending the bona fide error defense to serve an\noverlapping function.Footnote 9Carlisle raises concerns about whether, in\nlight of contemporary administrative practice, the FTC safe harbor\nis a realistic way for debt collectors and their lawyers to seek\nguidance on the numerous time-sensitive legal issues that arise in\nlitigation. These practical concerns, to which we return below, do\nnot change our understanding of the statutory text itself or the\nlikely intent of the enacting Congress.Footnote 10SeeIvesv.W. T. Grant\nCo., 522 F. 2d 749, 757\u2013758 (CA2 1975) (concluding that the\nbona fide error defense in \u00a71640(c) was unavailable despite\ncreditor\u2019s reliance, in selecting language for credit contract\nforms, on a pamphlet issued by the Federal Reserve Board);Haynesv.Logan Furniture Mart, Inc., 503\nF.\u00a02d 1161, 1167 (CA7 1974) (\u201c[Section] 1640(c) offers no\nshelter from liability for the defendant, whose error \u2026 was\njudgmental with respect to legal requirements of the Act and not\nclerical in nature\u201d);Palmerv.Wilson, 502\nF.\u00a02d 860, 861 (CA9 1974) (similar).Carlisle contends the meaning of TILA\u2019s defense was unsettled at\nthe time of the FDCPA\u2019s enactment, relying first on several\nDistrict Court opinions extending the defense to good-faith legal\nerrors. See,e.g.,Welmakerv.W. T. Grant\nCo., 365 F.\u00a0Supp. 531, 544 (ND Ga. 1972). But even\nassuming Congress would have looked to district court, rather than\ncourt of appeals, opinions in discerning the meaning of the\nstatutory language, applicable Circuit precedent had cast some\ndoubt on those decisions by the time the FDCPA was enacted. See,e.g.,Turnerv.Firestone Tire & Rubber\nCo., 537 F.\u00a02d 1296, 1298 (CA5 1976)(per\ncuriam)(referring to \u00a71640(c) as the \u201cso-called clerical\nerror defense\u201d). Carlisle also relies on the holding inThrift\nFunds of Baton Rouge, Inc.v.Jones, 274 So.\u00a02d\n150 (La. 1973). But in that case, the Louisiana Supreme Court\nconcluded only that a lender\u2019s mistaken interpretation ofstateusury law did not \u201camoun[t] to an intentional\nviolation of [TILA\u2019s] disclosure requirements.\u201dId.,at\n161. The Louisiana court had no occasion to address the question\nanalogous to the one we consider today: whether TILA\u2019s bona fide\nerror defense extended to violations resulting from mistaken\ninterpretation of TILA itself. See n. 4,supra;see alsoStarksv.Orleans Motors, Inc., 372 F.\u00a0Supp.\n928, 931 (ED La.) (distinguishingThrift Fundson this\nbasis), aff\u2019d, 500 F.\u00a02d 1182 (CA5 1974). These precedents\ntherefore do not convince us that Congress would have ascribed a\ndifferent meaning to the statutory language it chose for the FDCPA.\nComparepost, at 2 (Scalia, J.,concurring in\npart and concurring in judgment), withHerman &\nMacLeanv.Huddleston,459 U. S. 375, 384\u2013386,\nand n. 21 (1983) (concluding that Congress had \u201cratified\u201d the\n\u201cwell-established judicial interpretation\u201d of a statute by leaving\nit intact during a comprehensive revision, notwithstanding \u201c[t]wo\nearly district court decisions,\u201d not subsequently followed, that\nhad adopted a contrary view).Footnote 11That only three Courts of Appeals had\noccasion to address the question by the time the FDCPA was enacted\ndoes not render such an inference unreasonable. Contra,post, at 1\u20132 (opinion of Scalia, J.). Whether or not we\nwould take that view when such an inference serves as a court\u2019s\nsole interpretative guide, here our conclusion also relies on\ncommon principles of statutory interpretation, as well as the\nstatute\u2019s text and structure. Moreover, the inference is supported\nby the fact that TILA and the FDCPA were enacted as complementary\ntitles of the CCPA, a comprehensive consumer-protection statute.\nWhile not necessary to our conclusion, evidence from the\nlegislative record demonstrates that some Members of Congress\nunderstood the relationship between the FDCPA and existing\nprovisions of the CCPA. See,e.g.,123 Cong. Rec. 10242\n(1977) (remarks of Rep. Annunzio) (civil penalty provisions in\nHouse version of bill were \u201cconsistent with those in the [CCPA]\u201d);\nFair Debt Collection Practices Act: Hearings on S. 656 et al.\nbefore the Subcommittee on Consumer Affairs of the Senate Committee\non Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, 95th Cong., 1st Sess., 51,\n707 (1977) (statement of Rep. Wylie) (describing \u201c[c]ivil liability\nprovisions\u201d in the House bill as \u201cthe standard provisions that\nattach to all the titles of the [CCPA]\u201d).Footnote 12Although again not necessary to our\nconclusion, evidence from the legislative record suggests some\nMembers of Congress understood the amendment to \u201cclarif[y]\u201d the\nmeaning of TILA\u2019s bona fide error defense \u201cto make clear that it\napplies to mechanical and computer errors, provided they are not\nthe result of erroneous legal judgments as to the act\u2019s\nrequirements.\u201d S.\u00a0Rep. No. 96\u201373, pp. 7\u20138 (1979); see also\nLockhart, 153 A.\u00a0L.\u00a0R. Fed. 211\u2013212, \u00a72[a] (1999)\n(amendment \u201cwas intended merely to clarify what was then the\nprevailing view, that the bona fide error defense applies to\nclerical errors, not including errors of legal judgment\u201d) (relying\non S.\u00a0Rep. No. 96\u2013368, p. 32 (1979)).The concurring and dissenting opinions perceive an inconsistency\nbetween these references to clerical errors, as well as similar\nreferences in the pre-FDCPA precedents interpreting TILA,\nn.\u00a010,supra, and reading the FDCPA\u2019s bona fide error\ndefense to include factual mistakes.Post, at 2\u20134, and\nn.\u00a02 (opinion of Scalia, J.);post, at 20 (Kennedy,\nJ., dissenting). The quoted legislative history sources, however,\nwhile stating expressly that the TILA defense excludeslegalerrors, do not discuss a distinction between\nclerical and factual errors. Similarly, the cited cases\ninterpreting TILA do not address a distinction between factual and\nclerical errors; rather, the courts were presented with claims that\nthe defense applied to mistakes of law or other nonfactual errors\nthat the courts found not to be bona fide. SeeIves, 522\nF.\u00a02d, at 756\u2013757;Haynes, 503 F.\u00a02d, at\n1166\u20131167;Palmer, 502 F.\u00a02d, at 861. While factual\nmistakes might, in some circumstances, constitute bona fide errors\nand give rise to violations that are \u201cnot intentional\u201d within the\nmeaning of \u00a71692k(c), we need not and do not decide today the\nprecise distinction between clerical and factual errors, or what\nkinds of factual mistakes qualify under the FDCPA\u2019s bona fide error\ndefense. Cf. generally R. Hobbs, National Consumer Law Center, Fair\nDebt Collection \u00a77.2 (6th ed. 2008 and Supp. 2009) (surveying case\nlaw on scope of \u00a71692k(c)).Footnote 13The Government observes that several federal\nagencies have construed similar bona fide error defenses in\nstatutes they administer to exclude errors of law. See Brief for\nUnited States asAmicus Curiae28\u201330. The Secretary of\nHousing and Urban Development, for instance, has promulgated\nregulations specifying that the bona fide error defense in the Real\nEstate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974, 12 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a72607(d)(3), does not apply to \u201c[a]n error of legal judgment,\u201d 24\nCFR \u00a73500.15(b)(1)(ii) (2009). While administrative interpretations\nof other statutes do not control our reading of the FDCPA, we find\nit telling that no agency has adopted the view of the Court of\nAppeals. Of course, nothing in our opinion today addresses the\nvalidity of such regulations or the authority of agencies\ninterpreting bona fide error provisions in other statutes to adopt\na different reading. SeeNational Cable &\nTelecommunications Assn.v.Brand X Internet\nServices,545\nU. S. 967, 982\u2013983 (2005).Footnote 14For instance, an amendment was proposed and\nrejected during the Senate Banking Committee\u2019s consideration of the\nFDCPA that would have required proof that a debt collector\u2019s\nviolation was \u201cknowin[g].\u201d Senator Riegle, one of the Act\u2019s primary\nsponsors, opposed the change, explaining that the bill reflected\nthe view that \u201ccertain things ought not to happen, period\u2026\u00a0.\n[W]hether somebody does it knowingly, willfully, you know, with a\ngood heart, bad heart, is really quite incidental.\u201d See Senate\nCommittee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, Markup Session: S.\n1130\u2014Debt Collection Legislation 60 (July 26, 1977) (hereinafter\nMarkup); see alsoibid.(\u201cWe have left a way for these\ndisputes to be adj[u]dicated if they are brought, where somebody\ncan say, I didn\u2019t know that, or my computer malfunctioned,\nsomething happened, I didn\u2019t intend for the effect to be as it\nwas\u201d). To similar effect, a House Report on an earlier version of\nthe bill explained the need for new legislation governing use of\nthe mails for debt collection on grounds that existing statutes\n\u201cfrequently require[d]\u201d a showing of \u201cspecific intent[,] which is\ndifficult to prove.\u201d H.\u00a0R. Rep. No. 95\u2013131, p.\u00a03 (1977).\nElsewhere, to be sure, the legislative record contains statements\nmore supportive of Carlisle\u2019s interpretation. In particular, a\nconcern was raised in the July 26 markup session that the TILA bona\nfide error defense had been interpreted \u201cas only protecting against\na mathematical error,\u201d and that the FDCPA defense should \u201cgo\nbeyond\u201d TILA to \u201callow the courts discretion to dismiss a violation\nwhere it was a technical error.\u201d Markup 20. In response, a staffer\nexplained that the FDCPA defense would \u201capply to any violation of\nthe act which was unintentional,\u201d and answered affirmatively when\nthe Chairman asked: \u201cSo it\u2019s not simply a mathematical error but\nany bona fide error without intent?\u201dId.,at 21. Whatever\nthe precise balance of these statements may be, we can conclude\nthat this equivocal evidence from legislative history does not\ndisplace the clear textual and contextual authority discussed\nabove.Footnote 15The dissent also cites several other\nconsumer-protection statutes, such as TILA and the Fair Credit\nReporting Act, 15 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71681et seq., which in\nits view create \u201cincentives to file lawsuits even where no actual\nharm has occurred\u201d and are illustrative of what the dissent\nperceives to be a \u201ctroubling dynamic of allowing certain actors in\nthe system to spin even good-faith, technical violations of federal\nlaw into lucrative litigation.\u201dPost, at 5\u20136. The\ndissent\u2019s concern is primarily with Congress\u2019 policy choice,\nembodied in statutory text, to authorize private rights of action\nand recovery of attorney\u2019s fees, costs, and in some cases, both\nactual and statutory damages. As noted, in one of the statutes the\ndissent cites, Congress explicitly barred reliance on a\nmistake-of-law defense notwithstanding the \u201chighly technical\u201d\nnature of the scheme. See 15 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71640(c) (TILA);Ford Motor Credit Co.v.Milhollin,444 U. S. 555, 566 (1980). Similarly,\nthe plain text of the FDCPA authorizes a private plaintiff to\nrecover not only \u201cactual damage[s]\u201d for harm suffered but also\n\u201csuch additional damages as the court may allow,\u201d \u00a71692k(a).Footnote 16The Courts of Appeals generally review a\nDistrict Court\u2019s calculation of an attorney fee award under \u00a71692k\nfor abuse of discretion. See,e.g.,Carrollv.Wolpoff & Abramson, 53 F.\u00a03d 626, 628\u2013629 (CA4\n1995);Emanuelv.American Credit Exchange, 870\nF.\u00a02d 805, 809 (CA2 1989). Many District Courts apply a\nlodestar method, permitting downward adjustments in appropriate\ncircumstances. See,e.g.,Schlacherv.Law\nOffices of Phillip J. Rotche & Assoc., P.\u00a0C., 574\nF.\u00a03d 852 (CA7 2009) (relying onHensleyv.Eckerhart,461 U. S. 424(1983));Ferlandv.Conrad Credit Corp., 244 F. 3d 1145,\n1148\u20131151, and n. 4 (CA9 2001)(per curiam);see generally\nHobbs, Fair Debt Collection \u00a76.8.6. InSchlacher, for\ninstance, the court affirmed a downward adjustment for the\n\u201cunnecessary use of multiple attorneys \u2026 in a straightforward,\nshort-lived [FDCPA] case.\u201d 574 F.\u00a03d, at 854\u2013855. InCarroll, the court found no abuse of discretion in a\nDistrict Court\u2019s award of a $500 attorney\u2019s fee, rather than the\nlodestar amount, where the lawsuit had recovered only $50 in\ndamages for \u201cat most a technical violation\u201d of the FDCPA. 53\nF.\u00a03d, at 629\u2013631.Lower courts have taken different views about when, and whether,\n\u00a71692k requires an award of attorney\u2019s fees. CompareTolentinov.Friedman, 46 F. 3d 645 (CA7 1995)\n(award of fees to a successful plaintiff \u201cmandatory\u201d), andEmanuel,supra, at 808\u2013809 (same, even where the\nplaintiff suffered no actual damages), withGraziano, 950\nF. 2d, at 114, and n. 13 (attorney\u2019s fees may be denied for\nplaintiff\u2019s \u201cbad faith conduct\u201d), andJohnsonv.Eaton, 80 F.\u00a03d 148, 150\u2013152 (CA5 1996) (\u201cattorney\u2019s\nfees \u2026 are only available [under \u00a71692k] where the plaintiff has\nsucceeded in establishing that the defendant is liable for actual\nand/or additional damages\u201d; this reading \u201cwill deter suits brought\nonly as a means of generating attorney\u2019s fees\u201d). We need not\nresolve these issues today to express doubt that our reading of\n\u00a71692k(c) will impose unmanageable burdens on debt collecting\nlawyers.Footnote 17See Brief for Ohio Creditor\u2019s Attorneys\nAssociation et\u00a0al. asAmici Curiae4\u20136, and nn. 7\u20138\n(identifying \u201c134 state consumer protection and debt collection\nstatutes,\u201d 42 of which expressly exclude legal errors from their\ndefenses for bona fide errors).Footnote 18See,e.g.,Kan.

Ann.\n\u00a716a\u20135\u2013201(7) (2007) (provision of Kansas Consumer Credit Code\nproviding a defense for a \u201cbona fide error of law or fact\u201d); Ind.\nCode \u00a724\u20139\u20135\u20135 (West 2004) (defense for creditor\u2019s \u201cbona fide error\nof law or fact\u201d in Indiana Home Loan Practices Act).Footnote 19The dissent also downplays the predicate fact\nthat respondents in this case brought a foreclosure lawsuit against\nJerman for a debt she had already repaid. Neither the lower courts\nnor this Court have been asked to consider, and thus we express no\nview about, whether Carlisle could be subject to liability under\nthe FDCPA for that uncontested error\u2014regardless of how reasonably\nCarlisle may have acted after the mistake was pointed out by\nJerman\u2019s (privately retained) lawyer.Footnote 20CompareHartmanv.Great Senaca\nFinancial Corp., 569 F.\u00a03d 606, 614\u2013615 (CA6 2009)\n(suggesting that reasonable procedures might include \u201cperform[ing]\nongoing FDCPA training, procur[ing] the most recent case law, or\nhav[ing] an individual responsible for continuing compliance with\nthe FDCPA\u201d), withJohnsonv.Riddle, 443\nF.\u00a03d 723, 730\u2013731 (CA10 2006) (suggesting that researching\ncase law and filing a test case might be sufficient, but remanding\nfor a jury determination of whether the \u201climited [legal] analysis\u201d\nundertaken was sufficient and whether the test case was in fact a\n\u201csham\u201d).Footnote 21The dissent adds in passing that today\u2019s\ndecision \u201ccreates serious concerns \u2026 for First Amendment rights.\u201dPost, at 13 (citingLegal Services Corporationv.Velazquez,531 U.
