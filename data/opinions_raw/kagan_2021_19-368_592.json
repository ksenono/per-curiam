The accident happened\nin the State where suit was brought. The victim was one of the\nState\u2019s residents. And Ford did substantial business in the\nState\u2014among other things, advertising, selling, and servicing the\nmodel of vehicle the suit claims is defective. Still, Ford contends\nthat jurisdiction is improper because the particular car involved\nin the crash was not first sold in the forum State, nor was it\ndesigned or manufactured there. We reject that argument. When a\ncompany like Ford serves a market for a product in a State and that\nproduct causes injury in the State to one of its residents, the\nState\u2019s courts may entertain the resulting suit.IFord is a global auto company. It is\nincorporated in Delaware and headquartered in Michigan. But its\nbusiness is everywhere. Ford markets, sells, and services its\nproducts across the United States and overseas. In this country\nalone, the company annually distributes over 2.5 million new cars,\ntrucks, and SUVs to over 3,200 licensed dealerships. See App. 70,\n100. Ford also encourages a resale market for its products: Almost\nall its dealerships buy and sell used Fords, as well as selling new\nones. To enhance its brand and increase its sales, Ford engages in\nwide-ranging promotional activities, including television, print,\nonline, and direct-mail advertisements. No matter where you live,\nyou\u2019ve seen them: \u201cHave you driven a Ford lately?\u201d or \u201cBuilt Ford\nTough.\u201d Ford also ensures that consumers can keep their vehicles\nrunning long past the date of sale. The company provides original\nparts to auto supply stores and repair shops across the country.\n(Goes another slogan: \u201cKeep your Ford a Ford.\u201d) And Ford\u2019s own\nnetwork of dealers offers an array of maintenance and repair\nservices, thus fostering an ongoing relationship between Ford and\nits customers.Accidents involving two of Ford\u2019s vehicles\u2014a\n1996 Explorer and a 1994 Crown Victoria\u2014are at the heart of the\nsuits before us. One case comes from Montana. Markkaya Gullett was\ndriving her Explorer near her home in the State when the tread\nseparated from a rear tire. The vehicle spun out, rolled into a\nditch, and came to rest upside down. Gullett died at the scene of\nthe crash. The representative of her estate sued Ford in Montana\nstate court, bringing claims for a design defect, failure to warn,\nand negligence. The second case comes from Minnesota. Adam Bandemer\nwas a passenger in his friend\u2019s Crown Victoria, traveling on a\nrural road in the State to a favorite ice-fishing spot. When his\nfriend rear-ended a snowplow, this car too landed in a ditch.\nBandemer\u2019s air bag failed to deploy, and he suffered serious brain\ndamage. He sued Ford in Minnesota state court, asserting\nproducts-liability, negligence, and breach-of-warranty claims.Ford moved to dismiss the two suits for lack of\npersonal jurisdiction, on basically identical grounds. According to\nFord, the state court (whether in Montana or Minnesota) had\njurisdiction only if the company\u2019s conduct in the State had given\nrise to the plaintiff\u00a0\u2019s claims. And that causal link existed,\nFord continued, only if the company had designed, manufactured,\nor\u2014most likely\u2014sold in the State the particular vehicle involved in\nthe accident.[1] In neither\nsuit could the plaintiff make that showing. Ford had designed the\nExplorer and Crown Victoria in Michigan, and it had manufactured\nthe cars in (respectively) Kentucky and Canada. Still more, the\ncompany had originally sold the cars at issue outside the forum\nStates\u2014the Explorer in Washington, the Crown Victoria in North\nDakota. Only later resales and relocations by consumers had brought\nthe vehicles to Montana and Minnesota. That meant, in Ford\u2019s view,\nthat the courts of those States could not decide the suits.Both the Montana and the Minnesota Supreme\nCourts (affirming lower court decisions) rejected Ford\u2019s argument.\nThe Montana court began by detailing the varied ways Ford\n\u201cpurposefully\u201d seeks to \u201cserve the market in Montana.\u201d 395 Mont.\n478, 488, 443 P.3d 407, 414 (2019). The company advertises in the\nState; \u201chas thirty-six dealerships\u201d there; \u201csells automobiles,\nspecifically Ford Explorers[,] and parts\u201d to Montana residents; and\nprovides them with \u201ccertified repair, replacement, and recall\nservices.\u201dIbid. Next, the court assessed the relationship\nbetween those activities and the Gullett suit. Ford\u2019s conduct, said\nthe court, encourages \u201cMontana residents to drive Ford vehicles.\u201dId.,at 491, 443 P.\u00a03d, at 416. When that driving\ncauses in-state injury, the ensuing claims have enough of a tie to\nFord\u2019s Montana activities to support jurisdiction. Whether Ford\n\u201cdesigned, manufactured, or sold [the] vehicle\u201d in the State, the\ncourt concluded, is \u201cimmaterial.\u201dIbid.Minnesota\u2019s Supreme\nCourt agreed. It highlighted how Ford\u2019s \u201cmarketing and\nadvertisements\u201d influenced state residents to \u201cpurchase and drive\nmore Ford vehicles.\u201d 931 N.W.2d 744, 754 (2019). Indeed, Ford had\nsold in Minnesota \u201cmore than 2,000 1994 Crown Victoria[s]\u201d\u2014the\n\u201cvery type of car\u201d involved in Bandemer\u2019s suit.Id.,at 751,\n754. That the \u201cparticular vehicle\u201d injuring him was\n\u201cdesigned, manufactured, [and first] sold\u201d elsewhere made no\ndifference.Id.,at 753 (emphasis in original). In the\ncourt\u2019s view, Ford\u2019s Minnesota activities still had the needed\nconnection to Bandemer\u2019s allegations that a defective Crown\nVictoria caused in-state injury. Seeid.,at 754.We granted certiorari to consider if Ford is\nsubject to jurisdiction in these cases. 589 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2020).\nWe hold that it is.IIAThe Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause\nlimits a state court\u2019s power to exercise jurisdiction over a\ndefendant. The canonical decision in this area remainsInternational Shoe Co.v.Washington,326 U.S.\n310(1945). There, the Court held that a tribunal\u2019s authority\ndepends on the defendant\u2019s having such \u201ccontacts\u201d with the forum\nState that \u201cthe maintenance of the suit\u201d is \u201creasonable, in the\ncontext of our federal system of government,\u201d and \u201cdoes not offend\ntraditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\u201dId., at 316\u2013317 (internal quotation marks omitted). In\ngiving content to that formulation, the Court has long focused on\nthe nature and extent of \u201cthe defendant\u2019s relationship to the forum\nState.\u201dBristol-Myers Squibb Co.v.Superior Court of\nCal., San Francisco Cty., 582 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip\nop., at 5) (citing cases). That focus led to our recognizing two\nkinds of personal jurisdiction: general (sometimes called\nall-purpose) jurisdiction and specific (sometimes called\ncase-linked) jurisdiction. SeeGoodyear Dunlop Tires Operations,\nS.\u00a0A.v.Brown,564 U.S.\n915, 919 (2011).A state court may exercise general jurisdiction\nonly when a defendant is \u201cessentially at home\u201d in the State.Ibid.General jurisdiction, as its name implies, extends to\n\u201cany and all claims\u201d brought against a defendant.Ibid.Those claims need not relate to the forum State or the defendant\u2019s\nactivity there; they may concern events and conduct anywhere in the\nworld. But that breadth imposes a correlative limit: Only a select\n\u201cset of affiliations with a forum\u201d will expose a defendant to such\nsweeping jurisdiction.Daimler AGv.Bauman,571 U.S.\n117, 137 (2014). In what we have called the \u201cparadigm\u201d case, an\nindividual is subject to general jurisdiction in her place of\ndomicile.Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). And the\n\u201cequivalent\u201d forums for a corporation are its place of\nincorporation and principal place of business.Ibid.(internal quotation marks omitted); seeid., at 139,\nn.\u00a019 (leaving open \u201cthe possibility that in an exceptional\ncase\u201d a corporation might also be \u201cat home\u201d elsewhere). So general\njurisdiction over Ford (as all parties agree) attaches in Delaware\nand Michigan\u2014not in Montana and Minnesota. Seesupra,at\n2.Specific jurisdiction is different: It covers\ndefendants less intimately connected with a State, but only as to a\nnarrower class of claims. The contacts needed for this kind of\njurisdiction often go by the name \u201cpurposeful availment.\u201dBurger\nKing Corp.v.Rudzewicz,471 U.S.\n462, 475 (1985). The defendant, we have said, must take \u201csome\nact by which [it] purposefully avails itself of the privilege of\nconducting activities within the forum State.\u201dHansonv.Denckla,357 U.S.\n235, 253 (1958). The contacts must be the defendant\u2019s own\nchoice and not \u201crandom, isolated, or fortuitous.\u201dKeetonv.Hustler Magazine, Inc.,465 U.S.\n770, 774 (1984). They must show that the defendant deliberately\n\u201creached out beyond\u201d its home\u2014by, for example, \u201cexploi[ting] a\nmarket\u201d in the forum State or entering a contractual relationship\ncentered there.Waldenv.Fiore,571 U.S.\n277, 285 (2014) (internal quotation marks and alterations\nomitted). Yet even then\u2014because the defendant is not \u201cat home\u201d\u2014the\nforum State may exercise jurisdiction in only certain cases. The\nplaintiff\u00a0\u2019s claims, we have often stated, \u201cmust arise out of\nor relate to the defendant\u2019s contacts\u201d with the forum.Bristol-Myers, 582 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 5)\n(quotingDaimler, 571 U.\u00a0S., at 127; alterations\nomitted); see,e.g.,Burger King, 471 U.\u00a0S., at\n472;Helicopteros Nacionales de Colombia, S.A.v.Hall,466 U.S.\n408, 414 (1984);International Shoe, 326 U.\u00a0S., at\n319. Or put just a bit differently, \u201cthere must be \u2018an affiliation\nbetween the forum and the underlying controversy, principally, [an]\nactivity or an occurrence that takes place in the forum State and\nis therefore subject to the State\u2019s regulation.\u2019\u00a0\u201dBristol-Myers, 582 U.\u00a0S., at ___\u2212___, ___ (slip op., at\n5\u22126, 7) (quotingGoodyear, 564 U.\u00a0S., at 919).These rules derive from and reflect two sets of\nvalues\u2014treating defendants fairly and protecting \u201cinterstate\nfederalism.\u201dWorld-Wide Volkswagen Corp.v.Woodson,444 U.S.\n286, 293 (1980); seeid.,at 297\u2013298. Our decision inInternational Shoefounded specific jurisdiction on an idea\nof reciprocity between a defendant and a State: When (but only\nwhen) a company \u201cexercises the privilege of conducting activities\nwithin a state\u201d\u2014thus \u201cenjoy[ing] the benefits and protection of\n[its] laws\u201d\u2014the State may hold the company to account for related\nmisconduct. 326 U.\u00a0S., at 319; seeBurger King, 471\nU.\u00a0S., at 475\u2212476. Later decisions have added that our\ndoctrine similarly provides defendants with \u201cfair\nwarning\u201d\u2014knowledge that \u201ca particular activity may subject [it] to\nthe jurisdiction of a foreign sovereign.\u201dId.,at 472\n(internal quotation marks omitted);World-Wide Volkswagen,\n444 U.\u00a0S., at 297 (likewise referring to \u201cclear notice\u201d). A\ndefendant can thus \u201cstructure [its] primary conduct\u201d to lessen or\navoid exposure to a given State\u2019s courts.Id., at 297. And\nthis Court has considered alongside defendants\u2019 interests those of\nthe States in relation to each other. One State\u2019s \u201csovereign power\nto try\u201d a suit, we have recognized, may prevent \u201csister States\u201d\nfrom exercising their like authority.Id.,at 293. The law\nof specific jurisdiction thus seeks to ensure that States with\n\u201clittle legitimate interest\u201d in a suit do not encroach on States\nmore affected by the controversy.Bristol-Myers, 582\nU.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 6).[2]BFord contends that our jurisdictional rules\nprevent Montana\u2019s and Minnesota\u2019s courts from deciding these two\nsuits. In making that argument, Ford does not contest that it does\nsubstantial business in Montana and Minnesota\u2014that it actively\nseeks to serve the market for automobiles and related products in\nthose States. See Brief for Petitioner 6, 9, 13. Or to put that\nconcession in more doctrinal terms, Ford agrees that it has\n\u201cpurposefully avail[ed] itself of the privilege of conducting\nactivities\u201d in both places.Hanson, 357 U.\u00a0S., at 253;\nseesupra,at 5\u22126. Ford\u2019s claim is instead that those\nactivities do not sufficiently connect to the suits, even though\nthe resident-plaintiffs allege that Ford cars malfunctioned in the\nforum States. In Ford\u2019s view, the needed link must be causal in\nnature: Jurisdiction attaches \u201conly if the defendant\u2019s forum\nconductgave riseto the plaintiff\u00a0\u2019s claims.\u201d Brief\nfor Petitioner 13 (emphasis in original). And that rule reduces,\nFord thinks, to locating specific jurisdiction in the State where\nFord sold the car in question, or else the States where Ford\ndesigned and manufactured the vehicle. Seeid.,at 2; Reply\nBrief 2, 19;supra,at 3 (identifying those States). On that\nview, the place of accident and injury is immaterial. So (Ford\nsays) Montana\u2019s and Minnesota\u2019s courts have no power over these\ncases.But Ford\u2019s causation-only approach finds no\nsupport in this Court\u2019s requirement of a \u201cconnection\u201d between a\nplaintiff\u00a0\u2019s suit and a defendant\u2019s activities.Bristol-Myers, 582 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at\n8). That rule indeed serves to narrow the class of claims over\nwhich a state court may exercise specific jurisdiction. But not\nquite so far as Ford wants. None of our precedents has suggested\nthat only a strict causal relationship between the defendant\u2019s\nin-state activity and the litigation will do. As just noted, our\nmost common formulation of the rule demands that the suit \u201carise\nout ofor relate tothe defendant\u2019s contacts with the\nforum.\u201dId., at ___ (slip op., at 5) (quotingDaimler, 571 U.\u00a0S., at 127; emphasis added; alterations\nomitted); seesupra,at 6. The first half of that standard\nasks about causation; but the back half, after the \u201cor,\u201d\ncontemplates that some relationships will support jurisdiction\nwithout a causal showing. That does not mean anything goes. In the\nsphere of specific jurisdiction, the phrase \u201crelate to\u201d\nincorporates real limits, as it must to adequately protect\ndefendants foreign to a forum. But again, we have never framed the\nspecific jurisdiction inquiry as always requiring proof of\ncausation\u2014i.e.,proof that the plaintiff\u00a0\u2019s claim came\nabout because of the defendant\u2019s in-state conduct. See alsoBristol-Myers, 582 U.\u00a0S., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 5,\n7) (quotingGoodyear, 564 U.\u00a0S., at 919) (asking\nwhether there is \u201can affiliation between the forum and the\nunderlying controversy,\u201d without demanding that the inquiry focus\non cause). So the case is not over even if, as Ford argues, a\ncausal test would put jurisdiction in only the States of first\nsale, manufacture, and design. A different State\u2019s courts may yet\nhave jurisdiction, because of another \u201cactivity [or] occurrence\u201d\ninvolving the defendant that takes place in the State.Bristol-\nMyers, 582 U.\u00a0S., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 6, 7) (quotingGoodyear, 564 U.\u00a0S., at 919).[3]And indeed, this Court has stated that specific\njurisdiction attaches in cases identical to the ones here\u2014when a\ncompany like Ford serves a market for a product in the forum State\nand the product malfunctions there. InWorld-Wide\nVolkswagen, the Court held that an Oklahoma court could not\nassert jurisdiction over a New York car dealer just because a car\nit sold later caught fire in Oklahoma. 444 U.\u00a0S., at 295. But\nin so doing, we contrasted the dealer\u2019s position to that of two\nother defendants\u2014Audi, the car\u2019s manufacturer, and Volkswagen, the\ncar\u2019s nationwide importer (neither of which contested\njurisdiction):\u201c[I]f the sale of a product of a\nmanufacturer or distributor such as Audi or Volkswagen is not\nsimply an isolated occurrence, but arises from the efforts of the\nmanufacturer or distributor to serve, directly or indirectly, the\nmarket for its product in [several or all] other States, it is not\nunreasonable to subject it to suit in one of those States if its\nallegedly defective merchandise has there been the source of injury\nto its owner or to others.\u201dId., at 297.Or said another way, if Audi and Volkswagen\u2019s\nbusiness deliberately extended into Oklahoma (among other States),\nthen Oklahoma\u2019s courts could hold the companies accountable for a\ncar\u2019s catching fire there\u2014even though the vehicle had been designed\nand made overseas and sold in New York. For, the Court explained, a\ncompany thus \u201cpurposefully avail[ing] itself\u00a0\u201d of the Oklahoma\nauto market \u201chas clear notice\u201d of its exposure in that State to\nsuits arising from local accidents involving its cars.Ibid.And the company could do something about that exposure: It could\n\u201cact to alleviate the risk of burdensome litigation by procuring\ninsurance, passing the expected costs on to customers, or, if the\nrisks are [still] too great, severing its connection with the\nState.\u201dIbid.Our conclusion inWorld-Wide\nVolkswagen\u2014though, as Ford notes, technically \u201cdicta,\u201d Brief\nfor Petitioner 34\u2014has appeared and reappeared in many cases since.\nSo, for example, the Court inKeetoninvoked that part ofWorld-Wide Volkswagento show that when a corporation has\n\u201ccontinuously and deliberately exploited [a State\u2019s] market, it\nmust reasonably anticipate being haled into [that State\u2019s]\ncourt[s]\u201d to defend actions \u201cbased on\u201d products causing injury\nthere. 465 U.\u00a0S., at 781 (citing 444 U.\u00a0S., at 297\u2013298);\nseeBurger King, 471 U.\u00a0S., at 472\u2013473 (similarly\ncitingWorld-Wide Volkswagen). On two other occasions, we\nreaffirmed that rule by reciting the above block-quoted language\nverbatim. SeeGoodyear, 564 U.\u00a0S., at 927;Asahi\nMetal Industry Co.v.Superior Court of Cal., Solano\nCty.,480 U.S.\n102, 110 (1987) (opinion of O\u2019Connor, J.). And inDaimler, we used the Audi/Volkswagen scenario as a paradigm\ncase of specific jurisdiction (though now naming Daimler, the maker\nof Mercedes Benzes). Said the Court, to \u201cillustrate[\u00a0]\u201d\nspecific jurisdiction\u2019s \u201cprovince[\u00a0]\u201d: A California court\nwould exercise specific jurisdiction \u201cif a California plaintiff,\ninjured in a California accident involving a Daimler-manufactured\nvehicle, sued Daimler [in that court] alleging that the vehicle was\ndefectively designed.\u201d 571 U.\u00a0S., at 127, n.\u00a05. As inWorld-WideVolkswagen, the Court did not limit\njurisdiction to where the car was designed, manufactured, or first\nsold. Substitute Ford for Daimler, Montana and Minnesota for\nCalifornia, and the Court\u2019s \u201cillustrat[ive]\u201d case becomes\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. the two cases before us.To see why Ford is subject to jurisdiction in\nthese cases (as Audi, Volkswagen, and Daimler were in their\nanalogues), consider first the business that the company regularly\nconducts in Montana and Minnesota. See generally 395 Mont., at 488,\n443 P.\u00a03d, at 414; 931 N.\u00a0W. 2d, at 748;supra,at\n3\u22124. Small wonder that Ford has here conceded \u201cpurposeful\navailment\u201d of the two States\u2019 markets. Seesupra,at 7\u22128. By\nevery means imaginable\u2014among them, billboards, TV and radio spots,\nprint ads, and direct mail\u2014Ford urges Montanans and Minnesotans to\nbuy its vehicles, including (at all relevant times) Explorers and\nCrown Victorias. Ford cars\u2014again including those two models\u2014are\navailable for sale, whether new or used, throughout the States, at\n36 dealerships in Montana and 84 in Minnesota. And apart from\nsales, Ford works hard to foster ongoing connections to its cars\u2019\nowners. The company\u2019s dealers in Montana and Minnesota (as\nelsewhere) regularly maintain and repair Ford cars, including those\nwhose warranties have long since expired. And the company\ndistributes replacement parts both to its own dealers and to\nindependent auto shops in the two States. Those activities, too,\nmake Ford money. And by making it easier to own a Ford, they\nencourage Montanans and Minnesotans to become lifelong Ford\ndrivers.Now turn to how all this Montana- and\nMinnesota-based conduct relates to the claims in these cases,\nbrought by state residents in Montana\u2019s and Minnesota\u2019s courts.\nEach plaintiff\u00a0\u2019s suit, of course, arises from a car accident\nin one of those States. In each complaint, the resident-plaintiff\nalleges that a defective Ford vehicle\u2014an Explorer in one, a Crown\nVictoria in the other\u2014caused the crash and resulting harm. And as\njust described, Ford had advertised, sold, and serviced those two\ncar models in both States for many years. (Contrast a case, which\nwe do not address, in which Ford marketed the models in only a\ndifferent State or region.) In other words, Ford had systematically\nserved a market in Montana and Minnesota for the very vehicles that\nthe plaintiffs allege malfunctioned and injured them in those\nStates. So there is a strong \u201crelationship among the defendant, the\nforum, and the litigation\u201d\u2014the \u201cessential foundation\u201d of specific\njurisdiction.Helicopteros, 466 U.\u00a0S., at 414 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). That is why this Court has used this\nexact fact pattern (a resident-plaintiff sues a global car company,\nextensively serving the state market in a vehicle, for an in-state\naccident) as an illustration\u2014even a paradigm example\u2014of how\nspecific jurisdiction works. SeeDaimler, 571 U.\u00a0S., at\n127, n.\u00a05;supra,at 11.[4]The only complication here, pressed by Ford, is\nthat the company sold the specific cars involved in these crashes\noutside the forum States, with consumers later selling them to the\nStates\u2019 residents. Because that is so, Ford argues, the plaintiffs\u2019\nclaims \u201cwould be precisely the same if Ford had never done anything\nin Montana and Minnesota.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 46. Of course, that\nargument merely restates Ford\u2019s demand for an exclusively causal\ntest of connection\u2014which we have already shown is inconsistent with\nour caselaw. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 4;supra, at 8\u22129. And\nindeed, a similar assertion could have been made inWorld-WideVolkswagen\u2014yet the Court made clear that\nsystematic contacts in Oklahoma rendered Audi accountable there for\nan in-state accident, even though it involved a car sold in New\nYork. Seesupra,at 9\u221210. So too here, and for the same\nreasons, seesupra,at 11\u221212\u2014even supposing (as Ford does)\nthat without the company\u2019s Montana or Minnesota contacts the\nplaintiffs\u2019 claims would be just the same.But in any event, that assumption is far from\nclear. For the owners of these cars might never have bought them,\nand so these suits might never have arisen, except for Ford\u2019s\ncontacts with their home States. Those contacts might turn any\nresident of Montana or Minnesota into a Ford owner\u2014even when he\nbuys his car from out of state. He may make that purchase because\nhe saw ads for the car in local media. And he may take into account\na raft of Ford\u2019s in-state activities designed to make driving a\nFord convenient there: that Ford dealers stand ready to service the\ncar; that other auto shops have ample supplies of Ford parts; and\nthat Ford fosters an active resale market for its old models. The\nplaintiffs here did not in fact establish, or even allege, such\ncausal links. But cf.post,at 3\u20134 (Alito, J., concurring in\njudgment) (nonetheless finding some kind of causation). Nor should\njurisdiction in cases like these ride on the exact reasons for an\nindividual plaintiff\u00a0\u2019s purchase, or on his ability to present\npersuasive evidence about them.[5] But the possibilities listed above\u2014created by the reach\nof Ford\u2019s Montana and Minnesota contacts\u2014underscore the aptness of\nfinding jurisdiction here, even though the cars at issue were first\nsold out of state.For related reasons, allowing jurisdiction in\nthese cases treats Ford fairly, as this Court\u2019s precedents explain.\nIn conducting so much business in Montana and Minnesota, Ford\n\u201cenjoys the benefits and protection of [their] laws\u201d\u2014the\nenforcement of contracts, the defense of property, the resulting\nformation of effective markets.International Shoe, 326\nU.\u00a0S., at 319. All that assistance to Ford\u2019s in-state business\ncreates reciprocal obligations\u2014most relevant here, that the car\nmodels Ford so extensively markets in Montana and Minnesota be safe\nfor their citizens to use there. Thus our repeated conclusion: A\nstate court\u2019s enforcement of that commitment, enmeshed as it is\nwith Ford\u2019s government-protected in-state business, can \u201chardly be\nsaid to be undue.\u201dIbid.; seesupra,at 10\u221211. And asWorld-WideVolkswagendescribed, it cannot be thought\nsurprising either. An automaker regularly marketing a vehicle in a\nState, the Court said, has \u201cclear notice\u201d that it will be subject\nto jurisdiction in the State\u2019s courts when the product malfunctions\nthere (regardless where it was first sold). 444 U.\u00a0S., at 297;\nseesupra,at 10. Precisely because that exercise of\njurisdiction is so reasonable, it is also predictable\u2014and thus\nallows Ford to \u201cstructure [its] primary conduct\u201d to lessen or even\navoid the costs of state-court litigation.World-WideVolkswagen, 444 U.\u00a0S., at 297.Finally, principles of \u201cinterstate federalism\u201d\nsupport jurisdiction over these suits in Montana and Minnesota.Id., at 293. Those States have significant interests at\nstake\u2014\u201cproviding [their] residents with a convenient forum for\nredressing injuries inflicted by out-of-state actors,\u201d as well as\nenforcing their own safety regulations.Burger King, 471\nU.\u00a0S., at 473; seeKeeton, 465 U.\u00a0S., at 776.\nConsider, next to those, the interests of the States of first sale\n(Washington and North Dakota)\u2014which Ford\u2019s proposed rule would make\nthe most likely forums. For each of those States, the suit involves\nall out-of-state parties, an out-of-state accident, and\nout-of-state injuries; the suit\u2019s only connection with the State is\nthat a former owner once (many years earlier) bought the car there.\nIn other words, there is a less significant \u201crelationship among the\ndefendant, the forum, and the litigation.\u201dWalden, 571\nU.\u00a0S., at 284 (internal quotation marks omitted). So by\nchanneling these suits to Washington and North Dakota, Ford\u2019s\nregime would undermine, rather than promote, what the company calls\nthe Due Process Clause\u2019s \u201cjurisdiction-allocating function.\u201d Brief\nfor Petitioner 24.CFord mainly relies for its rule on two of our\nrecent decisions\u2014Bristol-MyersandWalden. But those\nprecedents stand for nothing like the principle Ford derives from\nthem. If anything, they reinforce all we have said about why\nMontana\u2019s and Minnesota\u2019s courts can decide these cases.Ford says ofBristol-Myersthat it\n\u201csquarely foreclose[s]\u201d jurisdiction. Reply Brief 2. In that case,\nnon-resident plaintiffs brought claims in California state court\nagainst Bristol-Myers Squibb, the manufacturer of a nationally\nmarketed prescription drug called Plavix. The plaintiffs had not\nbought Plavix in California; neither had they used or suffered any\nharm from the drug there. Still, the California Supreme Court\nthought it could exercise jurisdiction because Bristol-Myers Squibb\nsold Plavix in California and was defending there against identical\nclaims brought by the State\u2019s residents. This Court disagreed,\nholding that the exercise of jurisdiction violated the Fourteenth\nAmendment. In Ford\u2019s view, the same must be true here. Each of\nthese plaintiffs, like the plaintiffs inBristol-Myers,\nalleged injury from a particular item (a car, a pill) that the\ndefendant had sold outside the forum State. Ford readsBristol-Myersto preclude jurisdiction when that is true,\neven if the defendant regularly sold \u201cthe samekindof\nproduct\u201d in the State. Reply Brief 2 (emphasis in original).But that reading misses the point of our\ndecision. We found jurisdiction improper inBristol-Myersbecause the forum State, and the defendant\u2019s activities there,\nlacked any connection to the plaintiffs\u2019 claims. See 582\nU.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 8) (\u201cWhat is needed\u2014and what is\nmissing here\u2014is a connection between the forum and the specific\nclaims at issue\u201d). The plaintiffs, the Court explained, were not\nresidents of California. They had not been prescribed Plavix in\nCalifornia. They had not ingested Plavix in California. And they\nhad not sustained their injuries in California. Seeibid.(emphasizing these points). In short, the plaintiffs were engaged\nin forum-shopping\u2014suing in California because it was thought\nplaintiff-friendly, even though their cases had no tie to the\nState. Seeid.,at ___ (slip op., at 10) (distinguishing the\nPlavix claims from the litigation inKeeton, seesupra,at 10, because they \u201cinvolv[e] no in-state injury and\nno injury to residents of the forum State\u201d). That is not at all\ntrue of the cases before us. Yes, Ford sold the specific products\nin other States, as Bristol-Myers Squibb had. But here, the\nplaintiffs are residents of the forum States. They used the\nallegedly defective products in the forum States. And they suffered\ninjuries when those products malfunctioned in the forum States. In\nsum, each of the plaintiffs brought suit in the most natural\nState\u2014based on an \u201caffiliation between the forum and the underlying\ncontroversy, principally, [an] activity or an occurrence that\nt[ook] place\u201d there.Bristol-Myers, 582 U.\u00a0S., at\n___\u2212___, ___ (slip op., at 5\u22126, 7) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). SoBristol-Myersdoes not bar jurisdiction.Ford falls back onWaldenas its last\nresort. In that case, a Georgia police officer working at an\nAtlanta airport searched, and seized money from, two Nevada\nresidents before they embarked on a flight to Las Vegas. The\nvictims of the search sued the officer in Nevada, arguing that\ntheir alleged injury (their inability to use the seized money)\noccurred in the State in which they lived. This Court held the\nexercise of jurisdiction in Nevada improper even though \u201cthe\nplaintiff[s] experienced [the] effect[s]\u201d of the officer\u2019s conduct\nthere. 571 U.\u00a0S., at 290. According to Ford, our ruling shows\nthat a plaintiff\u00a0\u2019s residence and place of injury can never\nsupport jurisdiction. See Brief for Petitioner 32. And without\nthose facts, Ford concludes, the basis for jurisdiction crumbles\nhere as well.ButWaldenhas precious little to do with\nthe cases before us. InWalden, only the plaintiffs had any\ncontacts with the State of Nevada; the defendant-officer had never\ntaken any act to \u201cform[\u00a0] a contact\u201d of his own. 571\nU.\u00a0S., at 290. The officer had \u201cnever traveled to, conducted\nactivities within, contacted anyone in, or sent anything or anyone\nto Nevada.\u201dId., at 289. So to use the language of\nour doctrinal test: He had not \u201cpurposefully avail[ed himself] of\nthe privilege of conducting activities\u201d in the forum State.Hanson, 357 U.\u00a0S., at 253. Because that was true, the\nCourt had no occasion to address the necessary connection between a\ndefendant\u2019s in-state activity and the plaintiff\u00a0\u2019s claims. But\nhere, Ford has a veritable truckload of contacts with Montana and\nMinnesota, as it admits. Seesupra,at 11\u221212. The only issue\nis whether those contacts are related enough to the plaintiffs\u2019\nsuits. As to that issue, so what if (asWaldenheld) the\nplace of a plaintiff\u00a0\u2019s injury and residence cannot create a\ndefendant\u2019s contact with the forum State? Those places still may be\nrelevant in assessing the link between the defendant\u2019s forum\ncontacts and the plaintiff\u00a0\u2019s suit\u2014including its assertions of\nwho was injured where. And indeed, that relevance is a key part ofBristol-Myers\u2019 reasoning. See 582 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 9) (finding a lack of \u201cconnection\u201d in part because the\n\u201cplaintiffs are not California residents and do not claim to have\nsuffered harm in that State\u201d). One of Ford\u2019s own favorite cases\nthus refutes its appeal to the other.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*Here, resident-plaintiffs allege that they\nsuffered in-state injury because of defective products that Ford\nextensively promoted, sold, and serviced in Montana and Minnesota.\nFor all the reasons we have given, the connection between the\nplaintiffs\u2019 claims and Ford\u2019s activities in those States\u2014or\notherwise said, the \u201crelationship among the defendant, the\nforum[s], and the litigation\u201d\u2014is close enough to support specific\njurisdiction.Walden, 571 U.\u00a0S., at 284 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). The judgments of the Montana and\nMinnesota Supreme Courts are therefore affirmed.It is so ordered.Justice Barrett took no part in the\nconsideration or decision of these cases.Notes1Ford\u2019s Brief in Support\nof Motion to Dismiss inLucerov.Ford Motor Co., No.\nDV\u201318\u2013247 (8th Jud. Dist., Cascade Cty., Mont.), pp.\u00a014\u221215;\nFord Motor Co.\u2019s Memorandum in Support of Motion to Dismiss in No.\n77\u2013cv\u201316\u20131025 (7th Jud. Dist., Todd Cty., Minn.), pp.\u00a011\u221212,\nand n.\u00a03.2One of the concurrences\nhere expresses a worry that ourInternational Shoe-based\nbody of law is not \u201cwell suited for the way in which business is\nnow conducted,\u201d and tentatively suggests a 21st-century rethinking.Post,at 1 (Alito, J., concurring in judgment). Fair enough\nperhaps, seeinfra,at 12\u221213, n.\u00a04, but the concurrence\nthen acknowledges that these cases have no distinctively modern\nfeatures, and it decides them on grounds that (as it agrees) are\nmuch the same as ours. Seepost, at 3\u22124; compareibid.withinfra, at 11\u201315. The other concurrence\nproposes instead a return to the mid-19th century\u2014a replacement of\nour current doctrine with the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s original\nmeaning respecting personal jurisdiction.Post,at 9\u221210\n(Gorsuch, J., concurring in judgment). But that opinion never\nreveals just what the Due Process Clause as understood at its\nratification required, and its ground for deciding these cases is\ncorrespondingly spare.Post,at 11. This opinion, by\ncontrast, resolves these cases by proceeding as the Court has done\nfor the last 75 years\u2014applying the standards set out inInternational Shoeand its progeny, with attention to their\nunderlying values of ensuring fairness and protecting interstate\nfederalism.3In thus reiterating this\nCourt\u2019s longstanding approach, we reject Justice Gorsuch\u2019s apparent\n(if oblique) view that a state court should have jurisdiction over\na nationwide corporation like Ford onanyclaim, no matter\nhow unrelated to the State or Ford\u2019s activities there. Seepost,at 11. On that view, for example, a California court\ncould hear a claim against Ford brought by an Ohio plaintiff based\non an accident occurring in Ohio involving a car purchased in Ohio.\nRemoving the need for any connection between the case and forum\nState would transfigure our specific jurisdiction standard as\napplied to corporations. \u201cCase-linked\u201d jurisdiction, seesupra,at 5\u20136, would then become not case-linked at\nall.4None of this is to say\nthat any person using any means to sell any good in a State is\nsubject to jurisdiction there if the product malfunctions after\narrival. We have long treated isolated or sporadic transactions\ndifferently from continuous ones. See,e.g.,World-Wide\nVolkswagen Corp.v.Woodson,444\nU.S. 286, 297 (1980);supra,at 6. And we do not here\nconsider internet transactions, which may raise doctrinal questions\nof their own. SeeWaldenv.Fiore,571 U.S.\n277, 290, n.\u00a09 (2014) (\u201c[T]his case does not present the\nvery different questions whether and how a defendant\u2019s virtual\n\u2018presence\u2019 and conduct translate into \u2018contacts\u2019 with a particular\nState\u201d). So consider, for example, a hypothetical offered at oral\nargument. \u201c[A] retired guy in a small town\u201d in Maine \u201ccarves\ndecoys\u201d and uses \u201ca site on the Internet\u201d to sell them. Tr. of Oral\nArg. 39. \u201cCan he be sued in any state if some harm arises from the\ndecoy?\u201dIbid. The differences between that case and the ones\nbefore us virtually list themselves. (Just consider all our\ndescriptions of Ford\u2019s activities outside its home bases.) So we\nagree with the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel that resolving these cases does\nnot also resolve the hypothetical. Seeid.,at\n39\u221240.5It should, for example,\nmake no difference if a plaintiff had recently moved to the forum\nState with his car, and had not made his purchasing decision with\nthat move in mind\u2014so had not considered any of Ford\u2019s activities in\nhis new home State.",
