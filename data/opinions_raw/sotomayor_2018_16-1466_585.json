Although\nI joined the majority inSorrellv.IMS Health Inc.,\n564 U.\u00a0S. 552 (2011), I disagree with the way that this Court\nhas since interpreted and applied that opinion. See,e.g.,National Institute of Family and Life Advocatesv.Becerra,ante,p. ___. Having seen the troubling\ndevelopment in First Amendment jurisprudence over the years, both\nin this Court and in lower courts, I agree fully with Justice Kagan\nthatSorrell\u2014in the way it has been read by this Court\u2014has\nallowed courts to \u201cwiel[d] the First Amendment in .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nan aggressive way\u201d just as the majority does today.Post,at\n27.",
