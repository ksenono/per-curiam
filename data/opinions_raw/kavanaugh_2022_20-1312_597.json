The statutory formula for determining exactly\nhow much HHS will pay to those hospitals is mind-numbingly complex.\nBut embedded within the complicated overall formula are various\nsubsidiary calculations, some of which are relatively\nstraightforward.This case concerns one of those straightforward\nsubsidiary calculations. Consistent with traditional insurance and\ncoordination-of-benefits principles, Medicare by statute cannot pay\nfor a patient\u2019s hospital care if, for example, the patient is\ncovered by private insurance, the patient has exhausted her\nMedicare benefits, or a third-party tortfeasor is liable for the\npatient\u2019s care. The retrospective reimbursement question raised by\nthe statutory provision in this case is this: Was a patient\n\u201centitled to\u201d have payment made by Medicare for a particular day in\nthe hospital if the patient by statute could not (and did not) have\npayment made by Medicare for that day? In my view, the answer to\nthat narrow question is straightforward and commonsensical: No.Importantly, from the time the statute was\nenacted in 1986 until 2003, HHS interpreted this statutory\nprovision in the exact same way that I do. See 51 Fed. Reg.\n31460\u221231461 (1986); Brief for Petitioner 32\u221233. Then in 2004, HHS\nabruptly changed course. Why? Presumably to save money. HHS was\ntrying hard to find ways to contain Medicare costs in light of\nincreasing Medicare expenditures and the country\u2019s fiscal\nsituation. To that end, HHS\u2019s new 2004 interpretation of this\nstatutory provision had the downstream effect of significantly\nreducing HHS\u2019s reimbursements to hospitals that serve low-income\npatients.Whatever HHS\u2019s precise motivations for the 2004\nchange, we now must focus on the statutory text and HHS\u2019s current\ninterpretation of it. To begin, both parties offer a dog\u2019s\nbreakfast of arguments about broad statutory purposes, real-world\neffects, surplusage, structure, consistent usage, inconsistent\nusage, agency deference, and the like. But this case is resolved by\nthe most fundamental principle of statutory interpretation: Read\nthe statute.The relevant text of this reimbursement\nprovision refers to \u201cthe number of .\u00a0.\u00a0. patient days\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. which were made up of patients who (for such days)\nwere entitled to benefits under part A.\u201d 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a71395ww(d)(5)(F)(vi)(I). Importantly, the statute elsewhere says\nthat \u201c[t]he benefits provided\u201d under Medicare Part A consist of a\npatient\u2019s \u201centitlement tohave payment madeon his behalf\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. (subject to the provisions of this part).\u201d\n\u00a71395d(a) (emphasis added); see also \u00a7426(c) (\u201centitlement\u201d means\n\u201centitlement tohave payment madeunder, and subject to the\nlimitations in, part A\u201d (emphasis added)).Zero in on the phrases \u201centitlement to have\npayment made\u201d and \u201cfor such days.\u201d In my view (and in HHS\u2019s view\nfrom 1986 to 2003), a patient was entitled to have payment made by\nMedicare for particular days in the hospital if Medicare was\nobligated to pay for the patient\u2019s care for those days. Stated the\nother way, a patient wasnotentitled to have payment made\nby Medicare for particular days in the hospital if the patient by\nstatute could not (and did not) have payment made by Medicare for\nthose days\u2014for example, because the patient had other insurance,\nthe patient had exhausted his Medicare benefits, or a third-party\ntortfeasor was paying. Simple enough.To be sure, patients who satisfy certain\ncriteria (for example, those who are age 65 or older) are generally\n\u201centitled\u201d to Medicare hospitalization benefits. No one disputes\nthat point. But this reimbursement provision looks to whether the\npatient was entitled tohave payment madeby Medicarefor\na particular dayin the hospital. And the answer to that\nquestion is no if Medicare by statute could not (and did not) pay\nfor that day in the hospital.Suppose that a college says that your academic\nrecord entitles you to a scholarship for next year if your family\u2019s\nincome is under $60,000, unless you have received another\nscholarship. And suppose that your family\u2019s income is under\n$60,000, but you have received another scholarship. Are you still\nentitled to the first scholarship? Of course not. So too here.The Court concludes otherwise, mainly by\n(i)\u00a0saying that \u201centitled to benefits\u201d is a term of art in the\nMedicare statute, (ii)\u00a0diminishing the value of the statutory\nphrase \u201c(for such days),\u201d in part because the phrase appears in a\nparenthetical, and (iii)\u00a0invoking a parade of horribles about\nwhat could happen to other provisions of the Medicare statute if\nthe Court were to read this provision as I would.With respect, none of that adds up.First, although the Medicare statute generally uses\n\u201centitled\u201d to refer to those who meet the basic statutory criteria\nfor Medicare benefits, the retrospective reimbursement provision at\nissue here focuses laser-like on whether the patient was actually\nentitled to have payment made by Medicare for particular days in\nthe hospital. A patient cannot be simultaneously entitled and\ndisentitled to have payment made by Medicare for a particular day\nin the hospital.Second, contrary to the Court\u2019s\nsuggestion, we cannot brush aside the statutory phrase \u201c(for such\ndays)\u201d simply because that phrase appears in a parenthetical. SeeDuncanv.Walker,533 U.S.\n167, 174 (2001). Parentheticals can be important, as the\nConstitution itself makes clear. See,e.g., Art. I, \u00a77\n(counting days for bill to become law with \u201c(Sundays excepted)\u201d);\nArt.\u00a0IV, \u00a74 (affording federal protection to States on\napplication by the Executive but only \u201c(when the Legislature cannot\nbe convened)\u201d).Third, properly interpreting this\nspecific reimbursement provision will not \u201cmake a hash\u201d of other\nprovisions or render the Medicare statute \u201cunworkable.\u201dAnte, at 11\u221212. We need not speculate about that point: For\nnearly two decades from the time that the statute was enacted in\n1986 through 2003, HHS interpreted this reimbursement provision in\nthe same way that I do. And HHS did so without any noted problems\nfor other provisions in the Medicare statute.To sum up: A patient was not entitled to have\npayment made by Medicare \u201cfor such days\u201d in the hospital if the\npatient by statute could not (and thus did not) have payment made\nby Medicare for those days\u2014for example, because private insurance\nwas already covering the patient\u2019s care, or the patient had\nexhausted his Medicare benefits. Both statutory text and common\nsense point to that conclusion. HHS\u2019s contrary interpretation boils\ndown to the proposition that a patient can be simultaneously\nentitled and disentitled to have payment made by Medicare for a\nparticular day in the hospital. That interpretation does not work.\nAnd HHS\u2019s misreading of the statute has significant real-world\neffects: It financially harms hospitals that serve low-income\npatients, thereby hamstringing those hospitals\u2019 ability to provide\nneeded care to low-income communities.In my view, HHS\u2019s 2004 interpretation is not the\nbest reading of this statutory reimbursement provision. I\nrespectfully dissent.",
