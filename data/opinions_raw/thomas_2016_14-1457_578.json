Seeante,at 2\u20133, and n.\u00a02. I also\nagree with the Court\u2019s decision to reserve judgment on whether\nsentencing delays might violate the Due Process Clause.Ante,at 11. Brandon Betterman\u2019s counsel repeatedly\ndisclaimed that he was raising in this Court a challenge under the\nDue Process Clause. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 7\u20138 (\u201cWe haven\u2019t included\nthat. We didn\u2019t include that in the question presented, Your\nHonor\u201d);id.,at 8 (\u201c[W]e are not advancing that claim\nhere\u201d);id.,at 19 (\u201c[W]e didn\u2019t preserve a\u2014a due process\nchallenge. Our challenge is solely under the Sixth Amendment\u201d).We have never decided whether the Due Process\nClause creates an entitlement to a reasonably prompt sentencing\nhearing. Today\u2019s opinion leaves us free to decide the proper\nanalytical framework to analyze such claims if and when the issue\nis properly before us.Justice Sotomayor suggests that, for such\nclaims, we should adopt the factors announced inBarkerv.Wingo, 407 U.\u00a0S. 514 \u2013533 (1972).Post,at 2\n(concurring opinion). I would not prejudge that matter. The factors\nlisted inBarkermay not necessarily translate to the\ndelayed sentencing context. The Due Process Clause can be satisfied\nwhere a State has adequate procedures to redress an improper\ndeprivation of liberty or property. SeeParrattv.Taylor, 451 U.\u00a0S. 527, 537 (1981) . In unusual cases\nwhere trial courts fail to sentence a defendant within a reasonable\ntime, a State might fully satisfy due process by making traditional\nextraordinary legal remedies, such as mandamus, available. Or, much\nlike the federal Speedy Trial Act regulates trials, see 18\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73161, a State might remedy improper sentencing\ndelay by statute.[1] And a\nperson who sleeps on these remedies, as Betterman did, may simply\nhave no right to complain that his sentencing was delayed. We\nshould await a proper presentation, full briefing, and argument\nbefore taking a position on this issue.The Court thus correctly \u201cexpress[es] no opinion\non how [Betterman] might fare\u201d under the Due Process Clause.Ante,at 11.Notes1Montana law, for example,\nsecures the right to a prompt sentencing hearing. See Mont. Code\nAnn. \u00a746\u201318\u2013101(3)(a) (2015) (\u201cSentencing and punishment must be\ncertain, timely, consistent, and understand-able\u201d);\n\u00a746\u201318\u2013102(3)(a) (\u201c[I]f the verdict or finding is guilty, sentence\nmust be pronounced and judgment rendered within a reasonable\ntime\u201d); \u00a746\u201318\u2013115 (\u201c[T]he court shall conduct a sentencing\nhearing, without unreasonable delay\u201d).",
