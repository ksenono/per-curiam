YELLEN, SECRETARY OF THE\nTREASURY, et\u00a0al.JANET L. YELLEN, SECRETARY OF THE\nTREASURY, et\u00a0al., PETITIONERS19\u2013563v.PATRICK J. COLLINS, et\u00a0al.on writs of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the fifth circuit[June 23, 2021]Justice Gorsuch, concurring in part.I agree with the Court on the merits and am\npleased to join nearly all of its opinion. I part ways only when it\ncomes to the question of remedy addressed in Part III\u2013C.As the Court observes, the only question before\nus concerns retrospective relief.Ante, at 32. By the time\nwe turn to that question, the plaintiffs have proven that the\nDirector was without constitutional authority when he took the\nchallenged actions implementing the Third Amendment. In response to\nsuch a showing, a court would normally set aside the Director\u2019s\nultra vires actions as \u201ccontrary to constitutional right,\u201d 5\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7706(2)(B), subject perhaps to consideration of\ntraditional remedial principles such as laches. Seeante, at\n36, n.\u00a026;Abbott Laboratoriesv.Gardner,387 U.S.\n136, 155 (1967). Because the Court of Appeals did not follow\nthis course, this Court would normally vacate the judgment in this\nsuit with instructions requiring the Court of Appeals to conform\nits judgment to traditional practice. Today, the Court acknowledges\nit has taken exactly this course in cases involving\nunconstitutionally appointed executive officials.Ante, at\n33\u201334.Still, the Court submits, we should treat this\nsuit differently because the Director was unconstitutionally\ninsulated from removal rather than unconstitutionally appointed.Ante,at 33\u201334; see alsoante, at 7 (Thomas, J.,\nconcurring). It is unclear to me why this distinction should make a\ndifference. Either way, governmental action is taken by someone\nerroneously claiming the mantle of executive power\u2014and thus taken\nwith no authority at all. The Court points to not a single\nprecedent in 230 years of history for the distinction it would have\nus draw. Nor could it. The course it pursues today defies our\nprecedents. InBowsherv.Synar,478 U.S.\n714(1986), this Court concluded that Congress had vested the\nComptroller General with \u201cthe very essence\u201d of executive power,id., at 732\u2013733, but that he was (impermissibly) removable\nonly by Congress,id., at 727\u2013728. InSeila Law LLCv.Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, 591 U.\u00a0S. ___\n(2020), we found Congress had assigned the CFPB Director sweeping\nauthority over the financial sector,id., at ___\u2013___ (slip\nop., at 4\u20136), while insulating him \u201cfrom removal by an accountable\nPresident,\u201did., at ___ (slip op., at 23). In both cases\nthat meant the officers could \u201cnot be entrusted with executive\npowers\u201d from day one,Bowsher, 478 U.\u00a0S., at 732, and\nthe challenged actions were \u201cvoid,\u201dSeila Law, 591\nU.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 10).[1]If anything, removal restrictions may be a\ngreater constitutional evil than appointment defects. New\nPresidentsalwaysinherit thousands of Executive Branch\nofficials whom they did not select. It is the power to\nsupervise\u2014and, if need be, remove\u2014subordinate officials that allows\na new President to shape his administration and respond to the\nelectoral will that propelled him to office. After all, from the\nmoment \u201can officer is appointed, it is only the authority that can\nremove him, and not the authority that appointed him, that he must\nfear.\u201dSynarv.United States,626 F. Supp. 1374, 1401 (DC 1986) (per\u00a0curiam).\nChief Justice Taft, who knew a little about such things, put it\nthis way: \u201c[W]hen the grant of the executive power is enforced by\nthe express mandate to take care that the laws be faithfully\nexecuted, it emphasizes the necessity for including within the\nexecutive power as conferred the exclusive power of removal.\u201dMyersv.United States,272 U.S.\n52, 122 (1926). Because the power of supervising subordinates\nis essential to sound constitutional administration, as between\npresidential hiring and firing \u201cthe unfettered ability to remove is\nthe more important.\u201d M. McConnell, The President Who Would Not Be\nKing 167 (2020).Protecting this aspect of the separation of\npowers isn\u2019t just about protecting presidential authority.\nUltimately, the separation of powers is designed to \u201csecure[\u00a0]\nthe freedom of the individual.\u201dBondv.United\nStates,564 U.S.\n211, 221 (2011);ante, at 20\u201321. That\u2019s no less true\nhere than anywhere else. As Hamilton explained, the point of\nensuring presidential supervision of the Executive Branch is to\nensure \u201ca due dependence on the people\u201d and \u201ca due responsibility\u201d\nto them; these are key \u201cingredients which constitute safety in the\nrepublican sense.\u201d The Federalist No. 70, p. 424 (C. Rossiter ed.\n1961). In the case of a removal defect, a wholly unaccountable\ngovernment agent asserts the power to make decisions affecting\nindividual lives, liberty, and property. The chain of dependence\nbetween those who govern and those who endow them with power is\nbroken.United Statesv.Arthrex, Inc.,ante,at 3 (Gorsuch, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Few\nthings could be more perilous to liberty than some \u201cfourth branch\u201d\nthat does not answer even to the one executive official whoisaccountable to the body politic.FTCv.Ruberoid Co.,343 U.S.\n470, 487 (1952) (Jackson, J., dissenting).Instead of applying our traditional remedy for\nconstitutional violations like these, the Court supplies a novel\nand feeble substitute. The Court says that, on remand in this suit,\nlower courts should inquire whether the President would have\nremoved or overruled the unconstitutionally insulated official had\nhe known he had the authority to do so.Ante, at 35. So, if\nlower courts find that the President would have removed or\noverruled the Director,thenthe for-cause removal provision\n\u201cclearly cause[d] harm\u201d and the Director\u2019s actions may be set\naside.Ibid.Not only is this \u201crelief\u00a0\u201d unlike anything\nthis Court has ever before authorized in cases like ours; it is\nmaterially identical to a remedial approach this Court previously\nrejected. InBowsher, the Court directly addressed and\nexpressly refused the dissent\u2019s insistence that it should undertake\na \u201c\u00a0\u2018consideration\u2019 of the \u2018practical result of the removal\nprovision.\u2019\u00a0\u201d 478 U.\u00a0S., at 730. Instead of speculating\nabout what would have happened in a different world where the\nofficer\u2019s challenged actions were reviewable within the Executive\nBranch, the Court recognized that unconstitutionally insulating an\nofficer from removal \u201cinflicts a \u2018here-and-now\u2019 injury\u201d on affected\nparties.Seila Law, 591 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at\n10). Inthisworld, real people are injured by actions taken\nwithout lawful authority. \u201cThe Framers did not rest our liberties\non .\u00a0.\u00a0. minutiae\u201d like some guessing game about what\nmight have transpired in another timeline.Free Enterprise\nFundv.Public Company Accounting Oversight Bd.,561\nU.S. 477, 500 (2010).Other problems attend the Court\u2019s remedial\nscience fiction. It proceeds on an assumption that Congress would\nhave adopted a version of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act\n(HERA) that allowed the President to remove the Director. But that\nis sheer speculation. It is equally possible that\u2014had Congress\nknown it could not have a Director independent from presidential\nsupervision\u2014it would have deployed different tools to rein in\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Surely, Congress possessed no shortage\nof options. By way of example, it could have conferred new\nregulatory functions on an existing (and accountable) agency like\nthe Department of Housing and Urban Development, or it might have\nenacted detailed statutes to govern Fannie and Freddie\u2019s activities\ndirectly. For that matter, Congress might have opted for no\nadditional oversight rather than subject the Federal Housing\nFinance Agency (FHFA) to supervision by the President.This Court possesses no authority to substitute\nits own judgment aboutwhichlegislative solution Congress\nmight have adopted had it considered a problem never put to it.\nThat is not statutory interpretation; it is statutory reinvention.\nIndeed, while never uttering the words \u201cseverance doctrine,\u201d the\nCourt today winds up implicitly resting its remedial enterprise\nupon it\u2014severing, or removing, one part of Congress\u2019s work based on\nspeculation about its wishes and usurping a legislative prerogative\nin the process. See,e.g.,Arthrex,ante,at\n6\u20137 (Gorsuch, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part);Synar, 626 F.\u00a0Supp., at 1393. By once again purporting\nto do Congress\u2019s job, we discourage the people\u2019s representatives\nfrom taking up for themselves the task of consulting their oaths,\ngrappling with constitutional problems, and specifying a solution\nin statutory text. \u201cCongress can now simply rely on the courts to\nsort [it] out.\u201dTennesseev.Lane,541 U.S.\n509, 552 (2004) (Rehnquist, C.\u00a0J., dissenting).[2]The Court\u2019s conjecture does not stop there.\nAfter guessing what legislative scheme Congress would have adopted\nin some hypothetical but-for world, the Court tasks lower courts\nand the parties with reconstructing how executive agents would have\nreacted to it. On remand, we are told, the litigants and lower\ncourts must ponder whether the President would have removed the\nDirector had he known he was free to do so.Ante, at 35. Buthoware judges and lawyers supposed to construct the\ncounterfactual history? It is no less a speculative enterprise than\nguessing what Congress would have done had it known its statutory\nscheme was unconstitutional. It\u2019s only that the Court prefers to\nreserve the big hypothetical (legislative) choice for itself and\nleave others for lower courts to sort out.Consider the guidance the Court offers. It says\nlower courts should examine clues such as whether the President\nmade a \u201cpublic statement expressing displeasure\u201d about something\nthe Director did, or whether the President \u201cattempted\u201d to remove\nthe Director but was stymied by lower courts.Ibid.But what\nif the President never considered the possibility of removing the\nDirector because he was never advised of that possibility? What if\nhis advisers themselves never contemplated the option given\nstatutory law? And even putting all that aside, what evidence\nshould courts and parties consult when inquiring into the\nPresident\u2019s \u201cdispleasure\u201d? Are they restricted to publicly\navailable materials, even though the most probative evidence may be\nthe most sensitive? To ascertain with any degree of confidence the\nPresident\u2019s state of mind regarding the Director, don\u2019t we need\ntestimony from him or his closest staff?The Court declines to tangle with any of these\nquestions. It\u2019s hard not to wonder whether that\u2019s because it\nintends for this speculative enterprise to go nowhere. Rather than\nintrude on often-privileged executive deliberations, the Court may\ncalculate that the lower courts on remand in this suit will simply\nrefuse retroactive relief. See,e.g.,ante, at 6\n(Kagan, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment in part).\nBut if this is what the Court intends, why not just admit it and\nput these parties out of their misery?As strange as the Court\u2019s remand instructions\nare, the more important question lower courts face isn\u2019t how to\nresolve this suit but what to do with the next one. Today, the\nCourt sounds the call to arms and declares a constitutional\nviolation only to head for the hills as soon as it\u2019s faced with a\nrequest for meaningful relief. But as we have seen, the Court has\nin the past consistently vindicated Article II both in reasoning\nand in remedy.E.g.,Seila Law, 591 U.\u00a0S., at\n___ (opinion of Roberts, C.\u00a0J.) (slip op., at 36);Luciav.SEC, 585 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___\u2013___, n.\u00a05\n(2018) (slip op., at 12\u201313, n.\u00a05);NLRBv.Noel\nCanning,573 U.S.\n513, 557 (2014);Ryderv.United States,515 U.S.\n177, 182\u2013183 (1995);Bowsher, 478 U.\u00a0S., at 736.\nThese cases\u2014involving appointment and removal defects alike\u2014remain\ngood law. So what are lower courts faced with future removal defect\ncases to make of all this? The only lesson I can divine is that the\nCourt\u2019s opinion today is a product of its unique context\u2014a retreat\nprompted by the prospect that affording a more traditional remedy\nhere could mean unwinding or disgorging hundreds of millions of\ndollars that have already changed hands.Ante, at 32\u201333. The\nCourt may blanch at authorizing such relief today, but nothing it\nsays undoes our prior guidance authorizing more meaningful relief\nin other situations.For my part, rather than carve out some\nsuit-specific, removal-only, money-in-the-bank exception to our\nnormal rules for Article II violations, I would take a simpler and\nmore familiar path. Whether unconstitutionally installed or\nimproperly unsupervised, officials cannot wield executive power\nexcept as Article II provides. Attempts to do so are void;\nspeculation about alternate universes is neither necessary nor\nappropriate. In the world we inhabit, where individuals are\nburdened by unconstitutional executive action, they are \u201centitled\nto relief.\u201dLucia, 585 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at\n12).Notes1The Court\u2019s attempt to\nsidestep these cases leads nowhere.Seila Law, we are told,\ndiscussed standing\u2014not remedies\u2014when it said plaintiffs\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018sustain[\u00a0] injury\u2019\u00a0\u201d from unlawfully insulated\nexecutive action and may \u201cchalleng[e] [such] action as void.\u201d Seeante,at 34, n.\u00a024. But standing and remedies are\njoined at the hip: Article III permits a court only to provide \u201caremedythat redresses the plaintiffs\u2019injury-in-fact.\u201dCollinsv.Mnuchin, 938 F.3d\n553, 609 (CA5 2019) (Oldham, J., concurring in part and dissenting\nin part) (emphasis added). That is why a plaintiff \u201cmust have\nstanding [for] each form of relief\u201d sought.Town of Chesterv.Laroe Estates, Inc., 581 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip\nop., at 5).Bowsher, we are told, involved a legislative\nofficer\u2014not an executive one, which supposedly makes all the\ndifference.Ante, at 35, n.\u00a025. But there the\nComptroller was legislative only in the sense that he headed an\n\u201cindependent\u201d department and was accountable to Congress rather\nthan the President. 478 U.\u00a0S, at 730\u2013732. If there is any\ndifference here, it\u2019s that the FHFA Director\u2014who likewise heads an\n\u201cindependent\u201d agency, 12 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a74511(a)\u2014is accountable\ntono one. The idea that whether acts are void or not turns\non a label rather than on the functions an officer is assigned and\nwho he is accountable to should not be taken seriously.E.g.,Bowsher, 478 U.\u00a0S., at 727\u2013728, 732\u2013733;Free Enterprise Fundv.Public Company Accounting\nOversight Bd.,561 U.S.\n477, 484\u2013486, 496\u2013498 (2010);Seila Law, 591 U.\u00a0S.,\nat ___\u2013___, ___ (slip op., at 4\u20136, 23);ante, at 27\u201329,\n31\u201332.2Justice Thomas stakes out\nmore foreign terrain. After saying that he \u201cjoin[s] the Court\u2019s\nopinion in full,\u201d he argues there was no constitutional violation\nat all because the President\u2014despite statutes barring his way\u2014was\nfree to remove the Director all along.Ante, at 1, 4, 11.\nAccordingly, it seems Justice Thomas disagrees with all of Part\nIII\u2013B\u2019s merits analysis in addition to the Court\u2019s novel remedy in\nPart III\u2013C. Like the Court, though, he seemingly takes as given\nthat Congress would have chosen to adopt HERA even if it had known\nthis course required subjecting the Director to removal by the\nPresident.Ante, at 5\u20136. In doing so, he parts ways with his\nopinion last year inSeila Law, where he recognized the\nfollowing: First, in cases like ours, a constitutional violation\narises because of \u201cthe combination\u201d of statutory terms that (1)\nconfer executive power on an official and (2) improperly insulate\nhim from removal. 591 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (Thomas, J., concurring in\npart and dissenting in part) (slip op., at 21). Second, absent\nstatutory direction from Congress, we cannot divine \u201cwhich of the\nprovisions\u201d Congress would have kept and which it would have\nscrapped\u2014or what else it might have done\u2014had it known its actual\nchoice was unconstitutional.Id.,at ___ (slip op., at 23).\nThird, this Court lacks the \u201c\u00a0\u2018editorial freedom\u2019\u00a0\u201d to\npick and choose among options like these, for doing so would usurp\nCongress\u2019s legislative authority.Ibid.Today, Justice\nThomas suggestsSeila Lawrested on one party\u2019s concession\nabout the meaning of the law.Ante, at 8, n.\u00a05;ante, at 10. But parties cannot stipulate to the law.E.g.,Zivotofskyv.Kerry, 576 U.S. 1, 41,\nn.\u00a02 (2015) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment in part and\ndissenting in part);Youngv.United States,315 U.S.\n257, 258\u2013259 (1942). More importantly, his observations were\nright then\u2014and they remain so today.",
