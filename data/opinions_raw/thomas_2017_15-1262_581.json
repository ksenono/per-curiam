I write briefly to explain the additional grounds on which\nI would affirm the three-judge District Court and to note my\nagreement, in particular, with the Court\u2019s clear-error\nanalysis.As to District 1, I think North Carolina\u2019s\nconcession that it created the district as a majority-black\ndistrict is by itself sufficient to trigger strict scrutiny. See\nBrief for Appellants 44; see also,e.g.,Bethune-Hillv.Virginia State Bd. of Elections, 580 U.\u00a0S. ___,\n___\u2013___ (2017) (slip op., at 1\u20132) (Thomas, J., concurring in\njudgment in part and dissenting in part). I also think that North\nCarolina cannot satisfy strict scrutiny based on its efforts to\ncomply with \u00a72 of the VRA. Seeante, at 12. In my view, \u00a72\ndoes not apply to redistricting and therefore cannot justify a\nracial gerrymander. SeeHolderv.Hall, 512\nU.\u00a0S. 874 \u2013923 (1994) (Thomas, J., concurring in\njudgment).As to District 12, I agree with the Court that\nthe District Court did not clearly err when it determined that race\nwas North Carolina\u2019s predominant motive in drawing the district.\nSeeante, at 21. This is the same conclusion I reached when\nwe last reviewed District 12.Easleyv.Cromartie,\n532 U.\u00a0S. 234, 267 (2001) (Cromartie II) (dissenting\nopinion). The Court reached the contrary conclusion inCromartie\nIIonly by misapplying our deferential standard for reviewing\nfactual findings. Seeid.,at 259\u2013262. Today\u2019s decision does\nnot repeatCromartie II\u2019s error, and indeed it confines that\ncase to its particular facts. It thus represents a welcome course\ncorrection to this Court\u2019s application of the clear-error\nstandard.",
