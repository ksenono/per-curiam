    "text": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES_________________No. 18\u20136943_________________GREGORY DEAN BANISTER, PETITIONERv.LORIE DAVIS, DIRECTOR, TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE,\nCORRECTIONAL INSTITUTIONS DIVISIONon writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the fifth circuit[June 1, 2020]Justice Alito, with whom Justice Thomas joins,\ndissenting.Gregory Banister, a state prisoner, filed a\nfederal habeas petition arguing that his conviction was invalid for\n53 reasons. His arguments spanned almost 300 pages and featured an\nimagined retelling of the jury deliberations in the form of stage\ndialogue. After the District Court determined that all his claims\nlacked merit, he filed a motion rearguing many of them.If Banister had labeled this motion what it was\nin substance\u2014another habeas petition\u2014it would have been summarily\ndismissed under 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72244(b)(1). If he had\nlabeled it a motion for relief from judgment under Federal Rule of\nCivil Procedure 60(b), it would also have been subject to dismissal\nunder our decision inGonzalezv.Crosby,545 U.S.\n524(2005). Instead, he gave it a different label, styling it\nas a motion to alter the judgment under Rule 59(e), and the Court\nnow holds this label makes all the difference.The question in this case is whether a state\nprisoner can evade the federal habeas statute\u2019s restrictions on\nsecond or successive habeas petitions by affixing a Rule 59(e)\nlabel. The answer follows from our decision inGonzalez, and\nthe answer is no. If a Rule 59(e) motion asserts a habeas claim,\nthe motion functions as a second or successive habeas petition and\nshould be treated as such.IThe Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty\nAct of 1996 (AEDPA) \u201cstreamlin[es] federal habeas corpus\nproceedings.\u201dRhinesv.Weber,544 U.S.\n269, 277 (2005). A state prisoner is generally limited to a\nsingle federal habeas petition, which usually must be filed within\none year after the end of direct review; the district court must\ngive this petition \u201cpriority\u201d; if the prisoner is dissatisfied with\nthe district court\u2019s decision and wants to appeal, he must seek\npermission from the appropriate court of appeals and must set out\nthe errors he thinks the district court made; and the appeal can go\nforward only if a specified standard is met. \u00a7\u00a72244(d), 2253(c),\n2254(a), 2266(a). As we have frequently said, this design was\ncrafted to promote comity, finality, federalism, and judicial\nefficiency. See,e.g.,Panettiv.Quarterman,551 U.S.\n930, 945 (2007).Habeas petitions occupy an outsized place on\nfederal dockets. Seeinfra, at 13. Their efficient\nresolution not only preserves federal judicial capacity but removes\nthe cloud of federal review from state-court judgments. The federal\nhabeas provisions create a procedural regime that differs sharply\nfrom the regime that generally applies in civil cases, and the\nhabeas statute displaces any Federal Rule of Civil Procedure that\nis \u201cinconsistent with\u201d its provisions. 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72254\nRule 12 (Habeas Rule 12).Integral to AEDPA\u2019s design are its restrictions\non \u201csecond or successive\u201d habeas petitions, which, prior to AEDPA,\nsometimes led to very lengthy delays. See,e.g.,Kuhlmannv.Wilson,477 U.S.\n436, 453, and n.\u00a015 (1986) (plurality opinion). A\nprovision added by AEDPA, 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72244(b), is\ndesigned to prevent this. Under \u00a72244(b)(1), a second or successive\npetition may not duplicate the initial petition. Thus, any claim\n\u201cthat was presented in a prior application shall be dismissed.\u201d\n\u00a72244(b)(1). In addition, second or successive petitions usually\nmay not raise new claims either. Any claim \u201cthat was not presented\nin a prior application shall be dismissed unless\u201d it meets\nstringent standards contained in \u00a72244(b)(2). Specifically, to\navoid dismissal, a new claim must rely on (1) \u201ca new rule of\nconstitutional law\u201d that this Court has made applicable in habeas\nproceedings or (2) a fact that \u201ccould not have been discovered\npreviously through the exercise of due diligence\u201d and that now\nmakes the petitioner\u2019s innocence \u201cclear and convincing.\u201d\n\u00a7\u00a72244(b)(2)(A)\u2013(B).A prisoner wishing to file a second or\nsuccessive petition must apply to a court of appeals for permission\nto do so, and the court of appeals cannot authorize the filing\nunless the petition makes a prima facie showing that it meets\n\u00a72244(b)(2)\u2019s standards. \u00a72244(b)(3). If a court of appeals allows\nthe second or successive petition to be filed, the district court\nmust nevertheless review its claims and dismiss any that turns out\nnot to meet \u00a72244(b)(2)\u2019s standards. \u00a72244(b)(4).IIInGonzalez, we considered how \u00a72244(b)\napplies to a filing that is in essence a second or successive\nhabeas petition but bears a different label. The filing there was a\nmotion under Rule\u00a060(b), which allows a court to relieve a\nparty of an earlier judgment. Every Member of theGonzalezCourt, including those in dissent, recognized that whether a Rule\n60(b) motion should be treated as a habeas petition depends on the\nnature of the relief the motion seeks, not the label slapped onto\nit. 545 U.\u00a0S., at 532 (opinion of the Court);id., at\n538 (Breyer, J., concurring);id., at 539 (Stevens, J.,\ndissenting). And in considering whether a Rule 60(b) motion asserts\nthe type of relief that requires it to be treated as a habeas\npetition, the critical question is whether the motion in essence\nasserts a habeas claim, that is, a claim that propounds a \u201cfederal\nbasis for relief from a state court\u2019s judgment of conviction.\u201dId., at 530 (opinion of the Court). If the motion \u201cseeks to\nadd a new ground for\u201d that relief, it \u201cwill of course qualify\u201d as a\nsecond or successive habeas petition.Id., at 532. It will\nalso qualify \u201cif it attacks the federal court\u2019s previous resolution\nof a [habeas] claimon the merits.\u201dIbid.To see how this analysis plays out, imagine a\ncase in which a state prisoner files a Rule 60(b) motion alleging\nthat he was denied the effective assistance of counsel at trial. If\nthat claim was not in his initial habeas petition, the motion\nconstitutes a second or successive habeas petition because it\nasserts a new reason why he is entitled to habeas relief. And if\nthat claim was in his initial habeas petition but he now alleges\nthat the court erroneously denied the claim, the motion is still a\nsecond or successive habeas petition since it alleges that the\ncourt should have granted him habeas relief, an argument that is\n\u201ceffectively indistinguishable\u201d from the claim that he was entitled\nto that relief in the first place.Ibid. In either event, we\nheld inGonzalez, \u201cfailing to subject\u201d the motion to\n\u00a72244(b) \u201cwould be inconsistent with\u201d AEDPA.Id., at 531\n(internal quotation marks omitted).AlthoughGonzalezconcerned a motion\nunder Rule 60(b), nothing in its reasoning was tied to any specific\ncharacteristics of such a motion, and accordingly, there is no good\nreason why a Rule 59(e) motion should not be subject to the same\nrules. Indeed, the application ofGonzalez\u2019s reasoning is\neven more clear-cut when a habeas petitioner files a Rule 59(e)\nmotion. Like its neighbor, Rule 59(e) provides a way for a civil\nlitigant to get relief after the entry of judgment, but a\nRule\u00a059(e) motion can seek only \u201creconsideration of matters\nproperly encompassed in a decision on the merits.\u201dWhitev.New Hampshire Dept. of Employment Security,455 U.S.\n445, 451 (1982); accord,ante, at 10. And a claim that\n\u201cattacks the federal court\u2019s previous resolution of a claimon\nthe merits\u201d is exactly the type of claim that, underGonzalez, is subject to \u00a72244(b)(1) and must therefore be\ndismissed. 545 U.\u00a0S., at 532.[1]Today\u2019s opinion thus permits precisely the type\nof circumvention thatGonzalezprevents. Consider again the\nhabeas petitioner with the allegedly bad trial lawyer. Suppose\nthat, after the district court denies an ineffective-assistance\nclaim in his initial petition, he submits three effectively\nindistinguishable filings under different headers: a second habeas\npetition asserting the same claim again; a Rule 60(b) motion\ndisputing the court\u2019s resolution of the claim; and a Rule 59(e)\nmotion doing the same. The first two will face dismissal under\n\u00a72244(b)(1). But, under today\u2019s decision, the third may proceed.\nAnd not only that, if apro selitigant does not appreciate\nthat he can get around \u00a72244(b)(1) by calling his second or\nsuccessive petition a Rule 59(e) motion, a court may \u201cignore the\nlegal label that [the]pro\u00a0selitigant attaches to\u201d his\nfiling, treat the petition as a Rule 59(e) motion, and voil\u00e0,\n\u00a72244(b) disappears from view.Castrov.United\nStates,540 U.S.\n375, 381 (2003). This allows a habeas petitioner to obtain \u201ca\nsecond chance to have the merits determined favorably\u201d in\ncontravention of AEDPA and our reasoning inGonzalez, 545\nU.\u00a0S., at 533, n.\u00a05.IIIThe Court provides a variety of reasons for\nrefusing to followGonzalez, but none is sound.AThe Court begins by saying that a Rule 59(e)\nmotion is part of a petitioner\u2019s \u201cone fair opportunity to seek\nfederal habeas relief,\u201dante, at 1, but if there is a reason\nwhy a Rule 60(b) motion could not also be called part of that\n\u201copportunity,\u201d the Court does not offer one. A repetitive habeas\nclaim is as much a repetitive habeas claim if filed under Rule\n59(e) in 28 days or under Rule 60(b) at, say, day 29. The label is\nthe only \u201cvariance\u201d that explains why one is now allowed but not\nthe other.Ante, at 13.BThe Court proclaims that Rules 59(e) and 60(b)\ndiffer \u201cin just about every way that matters to the inquiry here,\u201dante, at 13, but none of the differences that the Court\ncites matter underGonzalez\u2019s reasoning, which relies on the\nnature of the claim asserted in the post-judgment motion. Under\nthat reasoning, it makes no difference that a Rule 60(b) motion may\nbe filed later than a Rule 59(e) motion, that a Rule 59(e) motion\n(but not a later-filed Rule 60(b) motion) suspends a judgment\u2019s\nfinality for purposes of appeal, or that an order denying a Rule\n59(e) motion merges with the judgment for purposes of appeal,\nwhereas a Rule 60(b) denial is separately appealable.Ante,\nat 14\u201315.Gonzalezdid not rely on a single one of the Rule\n60(b) characteristics mentioned by the Court here, and none matters\nunderGonzalez\u2019s reasoning. On the contrary,Gonzalez\u2019s logic was simple: If a motion advances a habeas\nclaim, it counts as a habeas petition.CThe Court looks to the history of motions to\nalter or amend a judgment, seeante, at 7\u20138, but it is hard\nto see how that history has a bearing on the issue in this case. As\nthe Court notes, trial courts once had the power to correct errors\nin their judgments during but not after the term in which the\njudgment was handed down, but how this is relevant to our issue is\na mystery. The point in time at which a court\u2019s power to alter or\namend a judgment ends (whether at the conclusion of a court term or\nat a specified point after the entry of the judgment) is used to\ndetermine whether a motion to alter or amend is timely. But the\nissue before us is not whether Banister filed his Rule 59(e) motion\nwithin the time allowed for such motions (he did) but whether his\nmotion counts as a habeas petition. The question would be exactly\nthe same if district courts still had terms of court and his motion\nwas filed before the term ended.DIn arguing that \u201c[t]his case requires us to\nchoose between\u201d \u00a72244(b) and Rule 59(e),ante, at 5, the\nCourt invokes Habeas Rule 12, which states that \u201c[t]he Federal\nRules of Civil Procedure, to the extent that they are not\ninconsistent with any statutory provisions or these rules, may be\napplied to a proceeding under these rules.\u201d According to the Court,\nAEDPA does not \u201cplace Rule 59(e) motions in th[e] category\u201d of\nsecond or successive petitions, and therefore AEDPA does not alter\nRule 59(e)\u2019s role.Ante, at 10.This argument greatly exaggerates the very\nlimited role of Habeas Rule 12. Although \u201chabeas corpus proceedings\nare characterized as \u2018civil,\u2019\u00a0\u201d \u201cthe label is gross and\ninexact.\u201dHarrisv.Nelson,394\nU.S. 286, 293\u2013294 (1969). They are \u201cunique,\u201d and even before\nAEPDA they \u201cconformed with civil practice only in a general sense.\u201dId., at 294. Thus, we have contrasted a \u201ccivil action,\ngoverned by the full panoply of the Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure,\u201d with the \u201cswift, flexible, and summary determination\u201d\nof a habeas claim.Preiserv.Rodriguez,411 U.S.\n475, 495\u2013496 (1973). The Civil Rules themselves give AEDPA\nprecedence. They \u201capply to proceedings for habeas corpus\u201d only\ninsofar as \u201cthe practice in those proceedings is not specified in a\nfederal statute\u201d or the Habeas Rules and \u201chas previously conformed\nto the practice in civil actions.\u201d Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 81(a)(4).\nAnd as we have observed, \u201c[s]uch specific evidence as there is with\nrespect to the intent of the draftsmen of the [civil] rules\nindicates nothing more than a general and nonspecific understanding\nthat the rules would have very limited application to habeas corpus\nproceedings.\u201dHarris, 394 U.\u00a0S., at 295.Let\u2019s count some of the ways in which habeas\nproceedings deviate from the Civil Rules. Discovery rules, which\nare central to civil litigation, do not apply \u201cas a matter of\nright\u201d in habeas proceedings.Ibid. Instead, a court\u2019s leave\nis required for factual development. See Habeas Rule 6(a); see alsoBracyv.Gramley,520 U.S.\n899, 908\u2013909 (1997). Another civil mainstay, the Rule 12(b)(6)\nmotion to dismiss, also has no place in habeas. SeeBrowderv.Director, Dept. of Corrections of Ill.,434 U.S.\n257, 269, n.\u00a014 (1978); see also Habeas Rule 4 (responsive\npleading not required unless the court directs). Indeed, the entire\n\u201ccivil action procedural sequencing\u2014from a motion to dismiss, to an\nanswer, to discovery, and ultimately to trial\u2014[i]s not applicable\nin habeas cases.\u201dO\u2019Brienv.Moore,395 F.3d 499, 506 (CA4 2005) (discussingBrowder, 434\nU.\u00a0S., at 269, n.\u00a014). Even nationwide service of process\nauthorized by statute, rather than the Civil Rules, is unavailable\nin habeas. SeeSchlangerv.Seamans,401 U.S.\n487, 489\u2013491, and n.\u00a04 (1971). And though courts have long\napplied \u201cnoncontroversial rules in habeas corpus proceedings,\u201dHarris, 394 U.\u00a0S., at 294, n.\u00a05, the mixed bag\nshows habeas\u2019s hybrid nature. See 4 C. Wright, A. Miller, & A.\nSteinman, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a71021, n. 6 (4th ed. Supp.\n2020) (Wright & Miller) (cataloging other rules that courts\nhave and have not applied).Our decisions rejecting some of the Civil Rules\u2019\nprocedural \u201cformalisms\u201d have often inured to the benefit of habeas\npetitioners.Hensleyv.Municipal Court, San\nJose-Milpitas Judicial Dist.,Santa Clara Cty.,411 U.S.\n345, 350 (1973). InO\u2019Nealv.McAninch,513 U.S.\n432(1995), we rejected a State\u2019s argument that Rule 61 put the\nburden on habeas petitioners to resolve doubts about whether trial\nerrors were harmless, and we reached that conclusion primarily\nbecause habeas proceedings are \u201c[u]nlike the civil cases cited by\nthe State.\u201dId., at 440. InHolidayv.Johnston,313 U.S.\n342(1941), the petitioner sought habeas relief from a district\ncourt but received a hearing before an Alcatraz commissioner. We\nheld that Rule 53, which allows a court to send some issues to a\n\u201cmaster,\u201d did not justify that practice in habeas cases; the\nfederal habeas statute contemplated proceedings before judges,\ngiving Rule 53 \u201cno application.\u201dId., at 353. In so holding,\nwe rejected the argument that the practice at issue was permissible\nbecause it was \u201ca convenient one,\u201did., at 352, the same\nclaim that the Court makes about Rule 59(e),ante, at 11.\nInstead, we held that a court \u201cmay not substitute another more\nconvenient mode\u201d from civil practice if it contravenes \u201cthe\nCongressional policy\u201d reflected \u201cin the Habeas Corpus Act.\u201dHoliday, 313 U.\u00a0S., at 352.AEDPA has only widened the gap between habeas\nand other civil proceedings, seeFelkerv.Turpin,518 U.S.\n651, 664 (1996), andGonzalezillustrates the point.\nLike Rule 59(e) and the other Rules just discussed, no federal\nhabeas provision \u201cexpressly circumscribe[s]\u201d the application of\nRule 60(b) in habeas cases. 545 U.\u00a0S., at 529. And like Rule\n59(e) but unlike the discovery rules, which were \u201cinnovations,\u201dHickmanv.Taylor,329 U.S.\n495, 500 (1947), Rule 60(b) descends from \u201cancient\u201d civil\npractice, 11 Wright & Miller \u00a72851. But AEDPA so \u201cdramatically\u201d\nreshaped federal habeas procedure,Rhines, 544 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 274, that courts must proceed \u201cin a manner consistent with the\nobjects of the statute\u201d even where it does not address a given\ndetail,Calderonv.Thompson,523\nU.S. 538, 554 (1998). Where a Civil Rule does conflict with a\nspecific AEDPA provision like \u00a72244(b), AEDPA necessarily\nprevails.On its own, then, Habeas Rule 12 cannot do the\nwork that Banister needs. He must show that AEDPA itself contains\nthe loophole he seeks to exploit, and he has not done so. The\nrefrain echoed by the Court\u2014that a Rule 59(e) motion comes included\nwith a petitioner\u2019s \u201cone full and fair opportunity\u201d for habeas\nrelief, Brief for Petitioner 1; seeante, at 1\u2014simply begs\nthe question that AEDPA answers: namely, what that opportunity\nentails. It does not entail \u201ca second chance to have the merits\u201d of\na habeas claim \u201cdetermined favorably.\u201dGonzalez, 545\nU.\u00a0S., at 533, n.\u00a05.Lifting partial quotations from our decision inBrowder, 434 U.\u00a0S., at 271, the Court states that we\nhave \u201calready held\u201d that Rule 59(e) is \u201c\u00a0\u2018thoroughly\nconsistent\u2019 with habeas law,\u201dante, at 7, but the partial\nquotations are highly misleading. The case had nothing to do with\nthe interplay between Rule 59(e) and restrictions on filing a\nsecond or successive habeas petition.InBrowder, a prison warden moved for\nreconsideration of a judgment granting habeas relief, but he did\nnot do so within the time allowed by Rule 59 and Rule 52(b), which\nsets the same deadline for a motion to amend factual findings. All\nthat the Court held was that those \u201ctime limits\u201d were \u201cthoroughly\nconsistent with the spirit of the habeas corpus statutes,\u201d which\ndid not address the \u201ctimeliness\u201d of such a motion. 434 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 270\u2013271.Browderin no way establishes that it is\n\u201cthoroughly consistent with\u201d AEDPA to allow a petitioner to\naccomplish via a Rule 59(e) motion what the prisoner could not\nachieve by honestly labeling his motion as a habeas\npetition.[2] The warden, of\ncourse, was not seeking habeas relief, so his Rule 59(e) motion\ncould not have constituted a successive habeas petition.EThis brings us to the Court\u2019s final redoubt,\npre-AEDPA practice. We have sometimes looked there in interpreting\nAEDPA\u2019s terms. SeeSlackv.McDaniel,529 U.S.\n473, 486 (2000). But assuming pre-AEDPA practice can inform our\nunderstanding of AEDPA, history lends no real support to the\nCourt\u2019s holding that a Rule 59(e) motion cannot count as a second\nor successive habeas petition. Research has found exactly one\ndecision that directly addresses that question, and its holding is\ncontrary to the Court\u2019s position.InBannisterv.Armontrout,4 F.3d 1434(CA8 1993), after the District Court denied a\nhabeas petition, the prisoner filed a Rule 59(e) motion asserting a\nnew claim. The Eighth Circuit held that this motion \u201cwas the\nfunctional equivalent of a second petition\u201d and rejected it on that\nground.Id., at 1445. The Court does not attempt to\ndistinguish that case, and cannot cite a single pre-AEDPA case that\ndirectly substantiates its claim about pre-AEDPA practice.Without any direct support, the Court reads\nvolumes into what it sees as the disparate treatment of habeas\npetitioners\u2019 Rule 60(b) and 59(e) motions in pre-AEDPA days.\nPre-AEDPA courts often, though not always, treated prisoners\u2019 Rule\n60(b) motions as successive habeas petitions. SeeBrewerv.Ward, 1996 WL 194830, *1 (CA10, Apr. 22, 1996) (noting the\ntrend as to motions \u201craising new claims\u201d but affirming a denial of\nRule 60(b) relief on the merits). By contrast, onlyBannisterdenied a Rule 59(e) motion on that basis, and a\nhandful of cases denied (or reversed lower-court decisions\ngranting) habeas petitioners\u2019 Rule 59(e) motions on other grounds.Ante, at 9. From this state of affairs, the Court infers\nthat Rule 59(e) motions were generally regarded as free from the\npre-AEDPA strictures on second or successive petitions. In other\nwords, the Court infers that judges thought that they were required\nto decide Rule 59(e) motions on the merits even if they were second\nor successive habeas petitions in substance.This is nothing but speculation, and there is a\nmore likely explanation for the disparity between reported cases\ndismissing Rule 60(b) and Rule 59(e) motions as second or\nsuccessive. Before AEDPA, whether to entertain a successive habeas\npetition was left to \u201cthe sound discretion of the federal trial\njudges,\u201dSandersv.United States,373 U.S.\n1, 18 (1963), and therefore the disparity may be attributable,\nnot to what judges thought they were required to do, but to what\nthey chose to do as a matter of discretion. And the Court provides\nthe obvious reasons why judges might have been more inclined to\nreach the merits in Rule 59(e) cases. A Rule 59(e) motion raises\nclaims that the judge recently decided; a Rule 60(b) motion may\nraise entirely new claims and may be filed later. For these\nreasons, judges might have found it more attractive to decide the\nmerits in Rule 59(e) cases when they had the discretion to do\nso.The important point, however, is that the Court\ncan only speculate. But based on that speculation, the Court is\nwilling to conclude that in the days before AEDPA, judges thought\nthat they were legally required to decide the merits of second or\nsuccessive habeas petitions if they were labeled as Rule 59(e)\nmotions and that AEDPA\u2019s express and tight restrictions on second\nor successive petitions were enacted on the understanding that this\nfeature of pre-AEDPA practice would not be disturbed. That is a\ntall order indeed, and this inconclusive case law does not suffice.\nSee,e.g.,Isbrandtsen Co.v.Johnson,343 U.S.\n779, 783 (1952) (\u201cStatutes .\u00a0.\u00a0. are to be read with\na presumption favoring the retention of long-established and\nfamiliar principles\u201d).IVAThe Court muses that its opinion \u201cmay make\nhabeas proceedings more efficient,\u201dante, at 11, but\nimproving statutes is not our job, and in any event, the Court\u2019s\nassessment of the consequences of its decision is dubious.State prisoners file thousands of federal habeas\npetitions per year.[3] After a\npetition is denied, as most are, the Court suggests that Rule 59(e)\ngives federal habeas courts a chance \u201cto correct their own errors\u201d\nor \u201cto clarify their reasoning,\u201d but the value of this opportunity\nis questionable since, as the Court admits, \u201cRule 59(e) motions\nseldom change judicial outcomes.\u201dAnte, at 11. Statistics\nagree that, in the main, district courts resolve habeas petitions\ncorrectly. In 2019, appeals courts reversed in only a miniscule\npercentage of appeals in cases involving state prisoners\u2019 habeas\nclaims.[4]The Court is probably right that, once in a\nwhile, a Rule\u00a059(e) motion could save the need for an appeal.\nBut that positive effect is very likely outweighed by the burden\nimposed by the entirely meritless Rule 59(e) motions that today\u2019s\ndecision will give prisoners an incentive to file. Not only will\nprisoners file such motions on the off chance of winning, but some\nmay file simply to toll the deadline for filing an appeal, Fed.\nRule App. Proc. 4(a)(4)(A)(iv). The burden of wading through these\nmotions will not always be \u201cslight.\u201dAnte, at 11; see App.\n219\u2013253 (Banister\u2019s motion). And the aggregate burden on the\ndistrict courts may actually be quite substantial.The Court\u2019s decision would be more\nunderstandable if it offered any real benefit for habeas\npetitioners, but it does not. As Banister concedes, see Brief for\nPetitioner 33, the standard for Rule 59(e) relief from an erroneous\njudgment is higher than the standard for permission to appeal.\nCompareMiller-Elv.Cockrell,537 U.S.\n322, 336 (2003) (\u201creasonable debate\u201d standard for a certificate\nof appealability), with 11 Wright & Miller \u00a72810.1 (\u201cmanifest\nerror\u201d standard for Rule 59(e) relief\u00a0). So if a prisoner has\na claim that can prevail under Rule 59(e), there should be no\nproblem in obtaining permission to appeal. That is the procedure\nprescribed by AEDPA, and it is an entirely reasonable one that does\nnot prejudice habeas petitioners.BIf treated according to their substance rather\nthan their label, Rule 59(e) motions would still have \u201can\nunquestionably valid role to play\u201d in habeas cases.Gonzalez, 545 U.\u00a0S., at 534. The construction of AEDPA\ninGonzalezdid not doom the Rule 60(b) motion at issue in\nthat case. Although deficient for other reasons, that motion\nchallenged \u201ca nonmerits aspect of the first federal habeas\nproceeding,\u201d the denial of the habeas petition on timeliness\ngrounds.Ibid. That sort of claim is not the equivalent of a\nhabeas claim. It does not assert a federal basis for relief from\nthe state-court judgment; rather, it seeks to cure a \u201cdefect\u201d in\nthe federal habeas proceeding itself.Id., at 532.Rule 59(e) motions can do the same. Through that\nRule, a petitioner can flag manifest errors in a district court\u2019s\napplication of AEDPA\u2019s statute of limitations, AEDPA\u2019s exhaustion\nrequirement, or the rules of procedural default. SeeWebbv.Davis, 940 F.3d 892, 898 (CA5 2019) (adding \u201cthe district\ncourt\u2019s denial of funding, the district court\u2019s dismissal of claims\nwithout conducting an evidentiary hearing, .\u00a0.\u00a0. the\ndistrict court\u2019s failure to consider claims presented in the habeas\napplication,\u201d and \u201cthe denial of a claim based on a valid appeal\nwaiver\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). These challenges\nrelate only to a petitioner\u2019s ability to assert a claim, not the\nmerits of the claim itself. UnderGonzalez, a petitioner\ncould seek reconsideration of them unencumbered by \u00a72244(b).That is not what Banister sought. In substance,\nhis Rule 59(e) motion was simply a repackaged version of his\npetition, and since the Fifth Circuit had not authorized him to\nfile it, the District Court had no jurisdiction to consider it. SeeBurtonv.Stewart,549 U.S.\n147, 153 (2007) (per curiam).VThe question remains whether Banister\u2019s Rule\n59(e) motion tolled his appeal deadline. Under 28\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72107(a), the Fifth\u00a0Circuit could hear his\nappeal only if he filed it within 30\u00a0days of the District\nCourt\u2019s judgment. SeeHamerv.Neighborhood Housing\nServs. of Chicago, 583 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at\n1). During that time, Banister filed his Rule 59(e) motion, but he\ndid not file his appeal until 66 days after the court denied his\nhabeas petition.Appellate Rule 4(a) provides that \u201cthe time to\nfile an appeal runs for all parties from the entry of the order\ndisposing of,\u201d among other things, a Rule 59(e) motion. Fed. Rule\nApp. Proc. 4(a)(4)(A)(iv). Not on that list: successive habeas\npetitions. Since that is what Banister\u2019s Rule 59(e) motion was in\nsubstance, it did not toll his appeal deadline.Banister contends that, even if his Rule 59(e)\nmotion constituted a habeas petition, the simple act of filing it\ngave him more time to appeal. He points to the statement inArtuzv.Bennett,531 U.S. 4(2000), that an application is commonly regarded as having been\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018filed\u2019\u00a0\u201d if \u201cit is delivered to, and accepted by, the\nappropriate court officer for placement into the official record.\u201dId., at 8. Under this definition, he argues, his motion was\nfiled, and therefore, the time to take an appeal was tolled until\nit was denied.This argument fails because the timeliness of\nBanister\u2019s appeal does not depend on whether what Banister labeled\na Rule 59(e) motion was \u201cfiled\u201d in the District Court. Under\nAppellate Rule 4(a), the time to appeal runs from the date when the\ndistrict court finally disposes of a motion falling within one of\nsix categories, including motions to alter or amend the judgment\nunder Rule 59. And whether a motion falls into one of those\ncategories depends on the substance of the motion, not the label\nthat is affixed to it. See,e.g.,Budinichv.Becton Dickinson & Co.,486 U.S.\n196, 199\u2013200, 203 (1988) (a motion for attorney\u2019s fees is not\nequivalent to a Rule 59(e) motion and did not toll the time to\nappeal);State Nat. Ins. Co.v.County of Camden, 824\nF.3d 399, 410 (CA3 2016);Yostv.Stout, 607 F.3d\n1239, 1243 (CA10 2010);Borrerov.Chicago, 456 F.3d\n698, 700 (CA7 2006);Moody Nat. Bank of Galvestonv.GE\nLife and Annuity Assurance Co.,383 F.3d 249, 251 (CA5 2004);Jonesv.UNUM Life Ins.\nCo. of America,223 F.3d 130, 136 (CA2 2000). Thus, to toll the time to appeal,\nBanister\u2019s motion had to be a motion to alter or amend, and because\n\u00a72244(b) dictates that his motion be treated as a habeas petition,\nit cannot be allowed to toll the time to appeal.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*I would hold that a Rule 59(e) motion that\nconstitutes a second or successive habeas petition is subject to\n\u00a72244(b) and that such a motion does not toll the time to appeal. I\ntherefore conclude that the Fifth Circuit was correct to dismiss\nBanister\u2019s untimely appeal. Because the Court holds to the\ncontrary, I respectfully dissent.Notes1Rule 59(e) motions can\nalso assert \u201cnewly discovered or previously unavailable evidence\u201d\nand \u201cintervening change[s] in controlling law.\u201d 11 C. Wright, A.\nMiller, & M. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a72810.1 (3d\ned. Supp. 2020). Banister\u2019s motion did neither, see Brief for\nPetitioner 47, so this case concerns only the types of claims that\nrequire automatic dismissal under 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a72244(b)(1).2Browdercites two\ncases for the proposition that courts had power to alter their\njudgments \u201cin habeas corpus cases.\u201d 434 U.\u00a0S., at 270.
