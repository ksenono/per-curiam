S. ____ (2008)SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESNO. 06-10119ALLEN SNYDER, PETITIONERv.LOUISIANAon writ of certiorari to the supreme court of\nlouisiana[March 19, 2008]Justice Thomas, with whom Justice\nScalia joins, dissenting.Petitioner essentially asks this\nCourt to second-guess the fact-based determinations of the\nLouisiana courts as to the reasons for a prosecutor\u2019s decision to\nstrike two jurors. The evaluation of a prosecutor\u2019s motives for\nstriking a juror is at bottom a credibility judgment, which lies\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018\u00a0peculiarly within a trial judge\u2019s province.\u2019\u00a0\u201dHernandezv.New York,500 U. S. 352, 365\n(1991) (plurality opinion) (quotingWainwrightv.Witt,469\nU. S. 412, 428 (1985));Hernandez, supra,at 372\n(O\u2019Connor, J., concurring in judgment);ante, at 4. \u201c[I]n\nthe absence of exceptional circumstances, we [should] defer to\nstate-court factual findings.\u201dHernandez, 500 U. S., at\n366. None of the evidence in the record as to jurors Jeffrey Brooks\nand Elaine Scott demonstrates that the trial court clearly erred in\nfinding they were not stricken on the basis of race. Because the\ntrial court\u2019s determination was a \u201cpermissible view of the\nevidence,\u201did.,at 369, I would affirm the judgment of the\nLouisiana Supreme Court.The Court begins by setting out the\n\u201cdeferential standard,\u201dante, at 7, that we apply to a\ntrial court\u2019s resolution of aBatsonv.Kentucky,476 U. S. 79(1986), claim, noting that we will overturn a ruling on the\nquestion of discriminatory intent only if it is \u201cclearly\nerroneous,\u201dante, at 4. Under this standard, we \u201cwill not\nreverse a lower court\u2019s finding of fact simply because we would\nhave decided the case differently.\u201dEasleyv.Cromartie,532 U. S. 234, 242\n(2001) (internal quotation marks omitted). Instead, a reviewing\ncourt must ask \u201cwhether, \u2018on the entire evidence,\u2019 it is \u2018left with\nthe definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been\ncommitted.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIbid.(quotingUnited Statesv.United States Gypsum Co.,333 U. S. 364, 395\n(1948)).The Court acknowledges two reasons why a trial\ncourt \u201chas a pivotal role in evaluatingBatsonclaims.\u201dAnte, at 4. First, the Court notes that the trial court is\nuniquely situated to judge the prosecutor\u2019s credibility because the\nbest evidence of discriminatory intent \u201c\u00a0\u2018\u00a0often will be\nthe demeanor of the attorney who exercises the challenge.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIbid.(quotingHernandez,supra,at 365\n(plurality opinion)). Second, it recognizes that the trial court\u2019s\n\u201cfirst-hand observations\u201d of the juror\u2019s demeanor are of \u201cgrea[t]\nimportance\u201d in determining whether the prosecutor\u2019s neutral basis\nfor the strike is credible.Ante, at 4.The Court\u2019s conclusion, however, reveals that\nit is only paying lipservice to the pivotal role of the trial\ncourt. The Court second-guesses the trial court\u2019s determinations in\nthis case merely because the judge did not clarify which of the\nprosecutor\u2019s neutral bases for striking Mr. Brooks was dispositive.\nBut we have never suggested that a reviewing court should defer to\na trial court\u2019s resolution of aBatsonchallenge only if\nthe trial court made specific findings with respect to each of the\nprosecutor\u2019s proffered race-neutral reasons. To the contrary, when\nthe grounds for a trial court\u2019s decision are ambiguous, an\nappellate court should not presume that the lower court based its\ndecision on an improper ground, particularly when applying a\ndeferential standard of review. SeeSprint/United Management\nCo.v.Mendelsohn,ante, at ___ (slip op.,\nat 6\u20137).The prosecution offered two neutral bases for\nstriking Mr. Brooks: his nervous demeanor and his stated concern\nabout missing class. App. 444. The trial court, in rejecting\ndefendant\u2019sBatsonchallenge, stated only \u201cAll right. I\u2019m\ngoing to allow the challenge. I\u2019m going to allow the challenge.\u201dId.,at 445. The Court concedes that \u201cthe record does not\nshow\u201d whether the trial court made its determination based on Mr.\nBrooks\u2019 demeanor or his concern for missing class,ante,at 6, but then speculates as to what the trial courtmighthave thought about Mr. Brooks\u2019 demeanor. As a result of that\nspeculation, the Court concludes that it \u201ccannot presume that the\ntrial court credited the prosecutor\u2019s assertion that Mr. Brooks was\nnervous.\u201dIbid. Inexplicably, however, the Court concludes\nthat itcanpresume that the trial court impermissibly\nrelied on the prosecutor\u2019s supposedly pretextual concern about Mr.\nBrooks\u2019 teaching schedule, even though nothing in the record\nsupports that interpretation over the one the Court rejects.Indeed, if the record suggests anything, it is\nthat the judge was more influenced by Mr. Brooks\u2019 nervousness than\nby his concern for missing class. Following an exchange about\nwhether his desire to get back to class would make Mr. Brooks more\nlikely to support a verdict on a lesser included offense because it\nmight avoid a penalty phase, defense counsel offered its primary\nrebuttal to the prosecutor\u2019s proffered neutral reasons. Immediately\nafter argument on the nervousness point, the judge ruled on theBatsonchallenge, even interrupting the prosecutor to do\nso:\u201cMR. VASQUEZ: His main problem yesterday was the\nfact that he didn\u2019t know if he would miss some teaching time as a\nstudent teacher. The clerk called the school and whoever it was and\nthe Dean said that wouldn\u2019t be a problem. He was told that this\nwould go through the weekend, and he expressed that that was his\nonly concern, that he didn\u2019t have any other problems.\u201cAs far as him looking nervous, hell,\neverybody out here looks nervous. I\u2019m nervous.\u201cMR. OLINDE: Judge, it\u2019s \u2014\u201cMR. VASQUEZ: Judge, that\u2019s \u2014 You know.\u201cMR. OLINDE: \u2014 a question of this: It\u2019s a peremptory challenge.\nWe need 12 out of 12 people. Mr. Brooks was very uncertain and very\nnervous looking and \u2014\u201cTHE COURT: All right. I\u2019m going to allow the challenge. I\u2019m\ngoing to allow the challenge.\u201d App. 445.Although this exchange is certainly not\nhard-and-fast evidence of the trial court\u2019s reasoning, it\nundermines the Court\u2019s presumption that the trial judge relied\nsolely on Mr. Brooks\u2019 concern for missing school.The Court also concludes that the trial\ncourt\u2019s determination lacked support in the record because the\nprosecutor failed to strike two other jurors with similar concerns.Ante, at 10\u201312. Those jurors, however, were never\nmentioned in the argument before the trial court, nor were they\ndiscussed in the filings or opinions on any of the three occasions\nthis case was considered by the Louisiana Supreme Court.*\nPetitioner failed to suggest a comparison with those two jurors in\nhis petition for certiorari, and apparently only discovered this\n\u201cclear error\u201d in the record when drafting his brief before this\nCourt. We have no business overturning a conviction, years after\nthe fact and after extensive intervening litigation, based on\narguments not presented to the courts below. Cf.Miller-Elv.Dretke,545 U. S. 231, 283\n(2005) (Thomas, J., dissenting).Because I believe that the trial court did not\nclearly err in rejecting petitioner\u2019sBatsonchallenge\nwith respect to Mr. Brooks, I also must address the strike of Ms.\nScott. The prosecution\u2019s neutral explanation for striking Ms. Scott\nwas that she was unsure about her ability to impose the death\npenalty. Like the claims made about Mr. Brooks, there is very\nlittle in the record either to support or to undermine the\nprosecution\u2019s asserted rationale for striking Ms. Scott. But the\ntrial court had the benefit of observing the exchange between the\nprosecutor and Ms. Scott, and accordingly was in the best position\nto judge whether the prosecutor\u2019s assessment of her response was\ncredible. When asked if she could consider the death penalty, her\nfirst response was inaudible. App. 360. The trial court, with the\nbenefit of contextual clues not apparent on a cold transcript, was\nbetter positioned to evaluate whether Ms. Scott was merely\nsoftspoken or seemed hesitant in her responses. Similarly, a\nfirsthand observation of demeanor is the only thing that could give\nsufficient content to Ms. Scott\u2019s ultimate response\u2014\u201cI think I\ncould,\u201did.,at 361\u2014to determine whether the prosecution\u2019s\nconcern about her willingness to impose the death penalty was well\nfounded. Given the trial court\u2019s expertise in making credibility\ndeterminations and its firsthand knowledge of thevoir\ndireexchanges, it is entirely proper to defer to its\njudgment. Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment below.*\u00a0While the Court correctly observes that the\nLouisiana Supreme Court made a comparison between Mr. Brooks and\nunstricken white jurors, that is true only as to jurors Vicki\nChauffe, Michael Sandras, and Arthur Yeager. 1998\u20131078 (La.\n9/6/06), 942 So.\u00a02d 484, 495\u2013496. The Court, on the other\nhand, focuses on Roland Laws and John Donnes, who were never\ndiscussed below in this context.",
