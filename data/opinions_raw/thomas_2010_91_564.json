S. ____ (2011)SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESNO. 10-290MICROSOFT CORPORATION, PETITIONERv.i4i\nLIMITED PARTNERSHIP et\u00a0al.on writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the federal circuit[June 9, 2011]Justice Thomas, concurring in the\njudgment.I am not persuaded that Congress\ncodified a standard of proof when it stated in the Patent Act of\n1952 that \u201c[a] patent shall be presumed valid.\u201d 35 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7282; seeante, at 7. \u201c[W]here Congress borrows terms of\nart,\u201d this Court presumes that Congress \u201cknows and adopts the\ncluster of ideas that were attached to each borrowed word \u2026 and the\nmeaning its use will convey to the judicial mind.\u201dMorissettev.United States,342 U. S. 246, 263\n(1952). But I do not think that the words \u201c[a] patent shall be\npresumed valid\u201d so clearly conveyed a particular standard of proof\nto the judicial mind in 1952 as to constitute a term of art. See,e.g.,ante, at 12, n.\u00a07 (\u201c[S]ome lower\ncourts doubted [the presumption\u2019s] wisdom or even pretended it did\nnot exist\u201d);Philip A. Hunt Co.v.Mallinckrodt\nChemical Works, 72 F.\u00a0Supp. 865, 869 (EDNY 1947) (\u201c[T]he\nimpact upon the presumption of many late decisions seems to have\nrendered it as attenuated \u2026 as the shadow of a wraith\u201d);Myersv.Beall Pipe & Tank Corp., 90\nF.\u00a0Supp. 265, 268 (D Ore. 1948) (\u201c[T]he presumption of\n[patent] validity \u2026 is treated by the appellate courts as\nevanescent as a cloud\u201d);American Hoist & Derrick Co.v.Sowa & Sons, Inc., 725 F.\u00a02d 1350, 1359 (CA\nFed. 1984) (\u201c[I]n 1952, the case law was far from consistent\u2014even\ncontradictory\u2014about the presumption\u201d); cf.Bruesewitzv.Wyeth LLC, 562 U. S. ___, ___\u2013___ (2011) (slip op., at\n9\u201310) (Congress\u2019 use of a word that is similar to a term of art\ndoes not codify the term of art). Therefore, I would not conclude\nthat Congress\u2019 use of that phrase codified a standard of proof.Nevertheless, I reach the same outcome as the\nCourt. Because \u00a7282 is silent as to the standard of proof, it did\nnot alter the common-law rule. Seeante, at 6 (\u201c[\u00a7282]\nincludes no express articulation of the standard of proof\u201d). For\nthat reason, I agree with the Court that the heightened standard of\nproof set forth inRadio Corp. of Amer- icav.Radio\nEngineering Laboratories, Inc.,293 U. S. 1(1934)\u2014which\nhas never been overruled by this Court or modified by\nCongress\u2014applies.",
