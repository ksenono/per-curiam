SESSIONS, III, ATTORNEY GENERALon writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the sixth circuit[May 30, 2017]Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the\nCourt.The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA),\n66Stat. 163, as amended, provides that \u201c[a]ny alien who is\nconvicted of an aggravated felony after admission\u201d to the United\nStates may be removed from the country by the Attorney General. 8\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71227(a)(2)(A)(iii). One of the many crimes that\nconstitutes an aggravated felony under the INA is \u201csexual abuse of\na minor.\u201d \u00a71101(a)(43)(A). A conviction for sexual abuse of a minor\nis an aggravated felony regardless of whether it is for a\n\u201cviolation of Federal or State law.\u201d \u00a71101(a)(43). The INA does not\nexpressly define sexual abuse of a minor.We must decide whether a conviction under a\nstate statute criminalizing consensual sexual intercourse between a\n21-year-old and a 17-year-old qualifies as sexual abuse of a minor\nunder the INA. We hold that it does not.IPetitioner Juan Esquivel-Quintana is a native\nand citizen of Mexico. He was admitted to the United States as a\nlawful permanent resident in 2000. In 2009, he pleaded no contest\nin the Superior Court of California to a statutory rape offense:\n\u201cunlawful sexual intercourse with a minor who is more than three\nyears younger than the perpetrator,\u201d Cal. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7261.5(c)\n(West 2014); see also \u00a7261.5(a) (\u201cUnlawful sexual intercourse is an\nact of sexual intercourse accomplished with a person who is not the\nspouse of the perpetrator, if the person is a minor\u201d). For purposes\nof that offense, California defines \u201cminor\u201d as \u201ca person under the\nage of 18 years.\u201dIbid.The Department of Homeland Security initiated\nremoval proceedings against petitioner based on that conviction. An\nImmigration Judge concluded that the conviction qualified as\n\u201csexual abuse of a minor,\u201d 8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71101(a)(43)(A),\nand ordered petitioner removed to Mexico.

Dec.\n469 (2015). \u201c[F]or a statutory rape offense involving a 16- or\n17-year-old victim\u201d to qualify as \u201c\u00a0\u2018sexual abuse of a\nminor,\u2019\u00a0\u201d it reasoned, \u201cthe statute must require a meaningful\nage difference between the victim and the perpetrator.\u201dId.,\nat 477. In its view, the 3-year age difference required by Cal.\nPenal Code \u00a7261.5(c) was meaningful.Id., at 477.\nAccordingly, the Board concluded that petitioner\u2019s crime of\nconviction was an aggravated felony, making him removable under the\nINA.Ibid.A divided Court of Appeals denied\nEsquivel-Quintana\u2019s petition for review, deferring to the Board\u2019s\ninterpretation of sexual abuse of a minor underChevron\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0A.

We granted certiorari, 580 U.\u00a0S.\n___ (2016), and now reverse.IISection 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) makes aliens\nremovable based on the nature of their convictions, not based on\ntheir actual conduct. SeeMellouliv.Lynch, 575\nU.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2015) (slip op., at 7). Accordingly, to\ndetermine whether an alien\u2019s conviction qualifies as an aggravated\nfelony under that section, we \u201cemploy a categorical approach by\nlooking to the statute .\u00a0.\u00a0. of conviction, rather than\nto the specific facts underlying the crime.\u201dKawashimav.Holder, 565 U.\u00a0S. 478, 483 (2012) ; see,e.g.,Gonzalesv.Duenas-Alvarez, 549 U.\u00a0S. 183, 186\n(2007) (applying the categorical approach set forth inTaylorv.United States, 495 U.\u00a0S. 575 (1990) ,\nto the INA). Under that approach, we ask whether \u201c\u00a0\u2018the state\nstatute defining the crime of conviction\u2019 categorically fits within\nthe \u2018generic\u2019 federal definition of a corresponding aggravated\nfelony.\u201dMoncrieffev.Holder, 569 U.\u00a0S. 184,\n190 (2013) (quotingDuenas-Alvarez,supra, at 186).\nIn other words, we presume that the state conviction \u201crested upon\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. the least of th[e] acts\u201d criminalized by the\nstatute, and then we determine whether that conduct would fall\nwithin the federal definition of the crime.Johnsonv.United States, 559 U.\u00a0S. 133, 137 (2010) ; see alsoMoncrieffe,supra, at 191 (focusing \u201con the minimum\nconduct criminalized by the state statute\u201d).[1] Petitioner\u2019s state conviction is thus an\n\u201caggravated felony\u201d under the INA only if the least of the acts\ncriminalized by the state statute falls within the generic federal\ndefinition of sexual abuse of a minor.ABecause Cal. Penal Code \u00a7261.5(c) criminalizes\n\u201cunlawful sexual intercourse with a minor who is more than three\nyears younger than the perpetrator\u201d and defines a minor as someone\nunder age 18, the conduct criminalized under this provision would\nbe, at a minimum, consensual sexual intercourse between a victim\nwho is almost 18 and a perpetrator who just turned 21. Regardless\nof the actual facts of petitioner\u2019s crime, we must presume that his\nconviction was based on acts that were no more criminal than that.\nIf those acts do not constitute sexual abuse of a minor under the\nINA, then petitioner was not convicted of an aggravated felony and\nis not, on that basis, removable.Petitioner concedes that sexual abuse of a minor\nunder the INA includes some statutory rape offenses. But he argues\nthat a statutory rape offense based solely on the partners\u2019 ages\n(like the one here) is \u201c\u00a0\u2018abuse\u2019\u00a0\u201d \u201conly when the younger\npartner is under 16.\u201d Reply Brief 2. Because the California statute\ncriminalizes sexual intercourse when the victim is up to 17 years\nold, petitioner contends that it does not categorically qualify as\nsexual abuse of a minor.BWe agree with petitioner that, in the context\nof statutory rape offenses that criminalize sexual intercourse\nbased solely on the age of the participants, the generic federal\ndefinition of sexual abuse of a minor requires that the victim be\nyounger than 16. Because the California statute at issue in this\ncase does not categorically fall within that definition, a\nconviction pursuant to it is not an aggravated felony under\n\u00a71101(a)(43)(A). We begin, as always, with the text.1Section 1101(a)(43)(A) does not expressly\ndefine sexual abuse of a minor, so we interpret that phrase using\nthe normal tools of statutory interpretation. \u201cOur analysis begins\nwith the language of the statute.\u201dLeocalv.Ashcroft, 543 U.\u00a0S. 1, 8 (2004) ; see alsoLopezv.Gonzales, 549 U.\u00a0S. 47, 53 (2006) (\u201cThe everyday\nunderstanding of\u201d the term used in \u00a71101 \u201cshould count for a lot\nhere, for the statutes in play do not define the term, and so remit\nus to regular usage to see what Congress probably meant\u201d).Congress added sexual abuse of a minor to the\nINA in 1996, as part of a comprehensive immigration reform act. See\nIllegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of\n1996, \u00a7321(a)(i), 110Stat. 3009\u2013627. At that time, the ordinary\nmeaning of \u201csexual abuse\u201d included \u201cthe engaging in sexual contact\nwith a person who is below a specified age or who is incapable of\ngiving consent because of age or mental or physical incapacity.\u201d\nMerriam-Webster\u2019s Dictionary of Law 454 (1996). By providing that\nthe abuse must be \u201cof a minor,\u201d the INA focuses on age, rather than\nmental or physical incapacity. Accordingly, to qualify as sexual\nabuse of a minor, the statute of conviction must prohibit certain\nsexual acts based at least in part on the age of the victim.Statutory rape laws are one example of this\ncategory of crimes. Those laws generally provide that an older\nperson may not engage in sexual intercourse with a younger person\nunder a specified age, known as the \u201cage of consent.\u201d Seeid., at 20 (defining \u201cage of consent\u201d as \u201cthe age at which a\nperson is deemed competent by law to give consent esp. to sexual\nintercourse\u201d and cross-referencing \u201cstatutory rape\u201d). Many laws\nalso require an age differential between the two partners.Although the age of consent for statutory rape\npurposes varies by jurisdiction, seeinfra, at 9, reliable\ndictionaries provide evidence that the \u201cgeneric\u201d age\u2014in 1996 and\ntoday\u2014is 16. See B. Garner, A Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage 38\n(2d ed. 1995) (\u201cAge of consent, usu[ally] 16, denotes the\nage when one is legally capable of agreeing .\u00a0.\u00a0. to\nsexual intercourse\u201d and cross-referencing \u201cstatutory rape\u201d);\nBlack\u2019s Law Dictionary 73 (10th ed. 2014) (noting that the age of\nconsent is \u201cusu[ally] defined by statute as 16 years\u201d).2Relying on a different dictionary (and\n\u201csparse\u201d legislative history), the Government suggests an\nalternative \u201c\u00a0\u2018everyday understanding\u2019\u00a0\u201d of \u201csexual abuse\nof a minor.\u201d Brief for Respondent 16\u201317 (citing Black\u2019s Law\nDictionary 1375 (6th ed. 1990)). Around the time sexual abuse of a\nminor was added to the INA\u2019s list of aggravated felonies, that\ndictionary defined \u201c[s]exual abuse\u201d as \u201c[i]llegal sex acts\nperformed against a minor by a parent, guardian, relative, or\nacquaintance,\u201d and defined \u201c[m]inor\u201d as \u201c[a]n infant or person who\nis under the age of legal competence,\u201d which in \u201cmost states\u201d was\n\u201c18.\u201dId., at 997, 1375. \u201c\u00a0\u2018Sexual abuse of a\nminor,\u2019\u00a0\u201d the Government accordingly contends, \u201cmost naturally\nconnotes conduct that (1) is illegal, (2) involves sexual activity,\nand (3) is directed at a person younger than 18 years old.\u201d Brief\nfor Respondent 17.We are not persuaded that the generic federal\noffense corresponds to the Government\u2019s definition. First, the\nGovernment\u2019s proposed definition is flatly inconsistent with the\ndefinition of sexual abuse contained in the very dictionary on\nwhich it relies; the Government\u2019s proposed definition does not\nrequire that the act be performed \u201cby a parent, guardian,\nrelative, or acquaintance.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1375 (6th\ned. 1990) (emphasis added). In any event, as we explain below,\noffenses predicated on a special relationship of trust between the\nvictim and offender are not at issue here and frequently have a\ndifferent age requirement than the general age of consent. Second,\nin the context of statutory rape, the prepositional phrase \u201cof a\nminor\u201d naturally refers not to the age of legal competence (when a\nperson is legally capable of agreeing to a contract, for example),\nbut to the age of consent (when a person is legally capable of\nagreeing to sexual intercourse). Third, the Government\u2019s definition\nturns the categorical approach on its head by defining the generic\nfederal offense of sexual abuse of a minor as whatever is illegal\nunder the particular law of the State where the defendant was\nconvicted. Under the Government\u2019s preferred approach, there is no\n\u201cgeneric\u201d definition at all. SeeTaylor, 495 U.\u00a0S., at\n591 (requiring \u201ca clear indication that .\u00a0.\u00a0. Congress\nintended to abandon its general approach of using uniform\ncategorical definitions to identify predicate offenses\u201d);id., at 592 (\u201cWe think that \u2018burglary\u2019 in \u00a7924(e) must have\nsome uniform definition independent of the labels employed by the\nvarious States\u2019 criminal codes\u201d).CThe structure of the INA, a related federal\nstatute, and evidence from state criminal codes confirm that, for a\nstatutory rape offense to qualify as sexual abuse of a minor under\nthe INA based solely on the age of the participants, the victim\nmust be younger than 16.1Surrounding provisions of the INA guide our\ninterpretation of sexual abuse of a minor. See A. Scalia & B.\nGarner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 167 (2012).\nThis offense is listed in the INA as an \u201caggravatedfelony.\u201d\n8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71227(a)(2)(A)(iii) (emphasis added). \u201cAn\n\u2018aggravated\u2019 offense is one \u2018made worse or more serious by\ncircumstances such as violence, the presence of a deadly weapon, or\nthe intent to commit another crime.\u2019\u00a0\u201dCarachuri-Rosendov.Holder, 560 U.\u00a0S. 563, 574\n(2010) (quoting Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 75 (9th ed. 2009)).\nMoreover, the INA lists sexual abuse of a minor in the\nsamesubparagraph as \u201cmurder\u201d and \u201crape,\u201d \u00a71101(a)(43)(A)\u2014among the\nmost heinous crimes it defines as aggravated felonies.\n\u00a71227(a)(2)(A)(iii). The structure of the INA therefore suggests\nthat sexual abuse of a minor encompasses only especially egregious\nfelonies.A closely related federal statute, 18\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72243, provides further evidence that the\ngeneric federal definition of sexual abuse of a minor incorporates\nan age of consent of 16, at least in the context of statutory rape\noffenses predicated solely on the age of the participants. Cf.Leocal, 543 U.\u00a0S., at 12\u201313, n.\u00a09 (concluding that\nCongress\u2019 treatment of 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a716 in an Act passed\n\u201cjust nine months earlier\u201d provided \u201cstron[g] suppor[t]\u201d for our\ninterpretation of \u00a716 as incorporated into the INA);Powerex\nCorp.v.Reliant Energy Services, Inc., 551 U.\u00a0S.\n224, 232 (2007) . Section 2243, which criminalizes \u201c[s]exual abuse\nof a minor or ward,\u201d contains the only definition of that phrase in\nthe United States Code. As originally enacted in 1986, \u00a72243\nproscribed engaging in a \u201csexual act\u201d with a person between the\nages of 12 and 16 if the perpetrator was at least four years older\nthan the victim. In 1996, Congress expanded \u00a72243 to include\nvictims who were younger than 12, thereby protecting anyone under\nthe age of 16. \u00a72243(a); see also \u00a72241(c). Congress did this in\nthe same omnibus law that added sexual abuse of a minor to the INA,\nwhich suggests that Congress understood that phrase to cover\nvictims under age 16.[2] See\nOmnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act, 1997, \u00a7\u00a7121(7), 321,\n110Stat. 3009\u201331, 3009\u2013627.Petitioner does not contend that the definition\nin \u00a72243(a) must be imported wholesale into the INA, Brief for\nPetitioner 17, and we do not do so. One reason is that the INA does\nnot cross-reference \u00a72243(a), whereas many other aggravated\nfelonies in the INA are defined by cross-reference to other\nprovisions of the United States Code, see,e.g.,\n\u00a71101(a)(43)(H) (\u201can offense described in section 875, 876, 877, or\n1202 of Title 18 (relating to the demand for or receipt of\nransom)\u201d). Another is that \u00a72243(a) requires a 4-year age\ndifference between the perpetrator and the victim. Combining that\nelement with a 16-year age of consent would categorically exclude\nthe statutory rape laws of most States. See Brief for Respondent\n34\u201335; cf.Taylor, 495 U.\u00a0S., at 594 (declining to\n\u201cconstru[e] \u2018burglary\u2019 to mean common-law burglary,\u201d because that\n\u201cwould come close to nullifying that term\u2019s effect in the statute,\u201d\nsince \u201cfew of the crimes now generally recognized as burglaries\nwould fall within the common-law definition\u201d). Accordingly, we rely\non \u00a72243(a) for evidence of the meaning of sexual abuse of a minor,\nbut not as providing the complete or exclusive definition.2As in other cases where we have applied the\ncategorical approach, we look to state criminal codes for\nadditional evidence about the generic meaning of sexual abuse of a\nminor. SeeTaylor, 495 U.\u00a0S., at 598 (interpreting\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018bur-glary\u2019\u00a0\u201d under the Armed Career Criminal Act of\n1984 according to \u201cthe generic sense in which the term is now used\nin the criminal codes of most States\u201d);Duenas-Alvarez, 549\nU.\u00a0S., at 190 (interpreting \u201ctheft\u201d in the INA in the same\nmanner). When \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d was added to the INA in\n1996, thirty-one States and the District of Columbia set the age of\nconsent at 16 for statutory rape offenses that hinged solely on the\nage of the participants. As for the other States, one set the age\nof consent at 14; two set the age of consent at 15; six set the age\nof consent at 17; and the remaining ten, including California, set\nthe age of consent at 18. See Appendix,infra; cf. ALI,\nModel Penal Code \u00a7213.3(1)(a) (1980) (in the absence of a special\nrelationship, setting the default age of consent at 16 for the\ncrime of \u201c[c]orruption of [m]inors\u201d).[3] A significant majority of jurisdictions thus set the\nage of consent at 16 for statutory rape offenses predicated\nexclusively on the age of the participants.Many jurisdictions set a different age of\nconsent for offenses that include an element apart from the age of\nthe participants, such as offenses that focus on whether the\nperpetrator is in some special relationship of trust with the\nvictim. That was true in the two States that had offenses labeled\n\u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d in 1996. See Alaska Stat. \u00a711.41.438\n(1996) (age of consent for third-degree \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d\nwas 16 generally but 18 where \u201cthe offender occupie[d] a position\nof authority in relation to the victim\u201d); Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit.\n17\u2013A, \u00a7254(1) (1983), as amended by 1995 Me. Laws p. 123 (age of\nconsent for \u201c[s]exual abuse of minors\u201d was 16 generally but 18\nwhere the victim was \u201ca student\u201d and the offender was \u201ca teacher,\nemployee or other official in the .\u00a0.\u00a0. school\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. in which the student [was] enrolled\u201d). And that is\ntrue in four of the five jurisdictions that have offenses titled\n\u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d today. Compare,e.g., D.\u00a0C.\nCode \u00a7\u00a722\u20133001 (2012), 22\u20133008 (2016 Cum. Supp.) (age of consent is\n16 in the absence of a significant relationship) with \u00a722\u20133009.01\n(age of consent is 18 where the offender \u201cis in a significant\nrelationship\u201d with the victim); see also Brief for Respondent 31\n(listing statutes with that title). Accordingly, the generic crime\nof sexual abuse of a minor may include a different age of consent\nwhere the perpetrator and victim are in a significant relationship\nof trust. As relevant to this case, however, the general consensus\nfrom state criminal codes points to the same generic definition as\ndictionaries and federal law: Where sexual intercourse is abusive\nsolely because of the ages of the participants, the victim must be\nyounger than 16.DThe laws of many States and of the Federal\nGovernment include a minimum age differential (in addition to an\nage of consent) in defining statutory rape. We need not and do not\ndecide whether the generic crime of sexual abuse of a minor under 8\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71101(a)(43)(A) includes an additional element\nof that kind. Petitioner has \u201cshow[n] somethingspecialabout California\u2019s version of the doctrine\u201d\u2014that the age of consent\nis 18, rather than 16\u2014and needs no more to prevail.Duenas-Alvarez,supra, at 191. Absent some special\nrelationship of trust, consensual sexual conduct involving a\nyounger partner who is at least 16 years of age does not qualify as\nsexual abuse of a minor under the INA, regardless of the age\ndifferential between the two participants. We leave for another day\nwhether the generic offense requires a particular age differential\nbetween the victim and the perpetrator, and whether the generic\noffense encompasses sexual intercourse involving victims over the\nage of 16 that is abusive because of the nature of the relationship\nbetween the participants.IIIFinally, petitioner and the Government debate\nwhether the Board\u2019s interpretation of sexual abuse of a minor is\nentitled to deference underChevron, 467 U.\u00a0S. 837 .\nPetitioner argues that any ambiguity in the meaning of this phrase\nmust be resolved in favor of the alien under the rule of lenity.\nSee Brief for Petitioner 41\u201345. The Government responds that\nambiguities should be resolved by deferring to the Board\u2019s\ninterpretation. See Brief for Respondent 45\u201353. We have no need to\nresolve whether the rule of lenity orChevronreceives\npriority in this case because the statute, read in context,\nunambiguously forecloses the Board\u2019s interpretation. Therefore,\nneither the rule of lenity norChevronapplies.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*We hold that in the context of statutory rape\noffenses focused solely on the age of the participants, the generic\nfederal definition of \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d under\n\u00a71101(a)(43)(A) requires the age of the victim to be less than 16.\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeals, accordingly, is reversed.It is so ordered.Justice Gorsuch took no part in the\nconsideration or decision of this case.APPENDIXThese tables list offenses criminalizing sexual\nintercourse solely because of the age of the participants. The\ntables are organized according to the statutory age of consent as\nof September 30, 1996\u2014the date \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d was added\nto the INA.14 Years15 Years16 Years17 Years18 YearsNotes1Where a state statute\ncontains several different crimes that are described separately, we\nemploy what is known as the \u201cmodified categorical approach.\u201d SeeGonzalesv.Duenas-Alvarez, 549 U.\u00a0S. 183, 187\n(2007) (internal quotation marks omitted). Under that approach,\nwhich is not at issue here, the court may review the charging\ndocuments, jury instructions, plea agreement, plea colloquy, and\nsimilar sources to determine the actual crime of which the alien\nwas convicted. Seeibid.2To eliminate a\nredundancy, Congress later amended \u00a72243(a) to revert to the\npre-1996 language. See Protection of Children From Sexual Predators\nAct of 1998, \u00a7301(b), 112Stat. 2979. That amendment does not change\nCongress\u2019 understanding in 1996, when it added sexual abuse of a\nminor to the INA.3The Government notes that\nthis sort of multijurisdictional analysis can \u201cbe useful insofar as\nit helps shed light on the \u2018common understanding and meaning\u2019 of\nthe federal provision being interpreted,\u201d but that it is not\nrequired by the categorical approach. Brief for Respondent 23\u201325\n(quotingPerrinv.United States, 444 U.\u00a0S. 37,\n45 (1979) ). We agree.
