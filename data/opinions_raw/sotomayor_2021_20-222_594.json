UnderBasic Inc.v.Levinson,485 U.S.\n224(1988), securities plaintiffs may demonstrate reliance by\ninvoking the rebuttable presumption that investors rely on any\nmisrepresentations reflected in a security\u2019s market price.Id.,at 241\u2013247. TheBasicpresumption is\nparticularly useful to class-action plaintiffs who, without the\npresumption, ordinarily could not demonstrate that questions common\nto the class predominate over individual ones.Ante,at 3\u20134.\nDefendants, for their part, may rebut theBasicpresumption\nby demonstrating that the alleged misrepresentations did not in\nfact affect the security\u2019s price.Ante,at 3. So-called\n\u201cprice impact\u201d may be disproved with a variety of evidence, alone\nor in combination. As the Court holds today, one potentially\nrelevant piece of evidence may be the \u201cgeneric nature\u201d of the\nmisrepresentation.Ante,at 6\u20138.I do not, however, join the Court\u2019s judgment to\nvacate and remand because I believe the Second Circuit \u201cproperly\nconsidered the generic nature of Goldman\u2019s alleged misrepre-\nsentations.\u201dAnte,at 8. On appeal, Goldman did not contend\nthat the District Court improperly refused to consider the generic\nnature of the alleged misstatements as evidence of price impact (or\nlack thereof\u00a0). Instead, Goldman argued that \u201cgeneral\nstatements, like those challenged here, are incapable of impacting\na company\u2019s stock price as a matter of law\u201d because they are\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018too general to cause a reasonable investor to rely upon\nthem.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Brief for Appellants in No. 18\u20133667 (CA2), pp. 43,\n46. Goldman reasoned that \u201cthe challenged statements are incapable\nof maintaining inflation in a stock price for the same reasons that\nthose statements are immaterial as a matter of law (as well as\nfact).\u201dId.,at 48.The Second Circuit properly rejected Goldman\u2019s\nargument. The court explained that although \u201cGoldman is not\nformally asking for a materiality test,\u201d its proposed rule would\n\u201cessentially requir[e] courts to ask\u201d at the class- certification\nstage \u201cwhether the alleged misstatements are, in Goldman\u2019s words,\n\u2018immaterial as a matter of law.\u2019\u00a0\u201d 955 F.3d 254, 267 (2020).\nBut \u201cmateriality is irrelevant at the Rule 23 stage.\u201dId.,at 268 (citingAmgen Inc.v.Connecticut Retirement Plans\nand Trust Funds,568 U.S.\n455, 468 (2013)). \u201cIf general statements cannot maintain price\ninflationbecauseno reasonable investor would have relied\non them, then the question of inactionable generality is common to\nthe class.\u201d 955 F.\u00a03d, at 268.In declining to adopt Goldman\u2019s proposed rule\nthat generic misstatements cannot have a price impact (as a matter\nof law), the Second Circuit nowhere held that the generic nature of\nan alleged misstatement could not serve as evidence of price impact\n(as a matter of fact). Nor did the Second Circuit refuse to\nconsider such evidence in affirming the District Court\u2019s finding\nthat Goldman failed to rebut theBasicpresumption. The\nCourt nevertheless reads a handful of sentences in the Second\nCircuit\u2019s opinion to create \u201cdoubt\u201d over whether the Court of\nAppeals refused to consider \u201callrecord evidence relevant to\nprice impact.\u201dAnte,at 9; see alsoante,at 9,\nn.\u00a03. But such statements must be viewed in the context of\nGoldman\u2019s now-abandoned argument that generic misrepresentations\nhave no price impact as a matter of law. Take, for example, the\nSecond Circuit\u2019s statement that \u201c[w]hether alleged misstatements\nare too general to demonstrate price impact has nothing to do with\nthe issue of whether common questions predominate over individual\nones.\u201d 955 F.\u00a03d, at 268. Fairly read in light of Goldman\u2019s\nappellate briefing, that sentence addresses only Goldman\u2019s argument\nthat general statements are alwaysper\u00a0seirrelevant.\nThat is why the Second Circuit observed several sentences later\nthat \u201cGoldman\u2019s test is materiality by another name.\u201dIbid.At the same time, the court was careful to emphasize that\ndefendants \u201cmay attempt to disprove [price impact] at class\ncertification\u201d even though the inquiry \u201cresembles\nmateriality.\u201d[1]*Id.,at 267.In short, the Second Circuit did not address\nwhether the generic nature of a misstatement may be used as\nevidence to disprove price impact for a simple reason: Goldman\nidentified no error in the District Court\u2019s treatment of such\nevidence. Goldman did not press the argument in the Second Circuit\nthat it now urges here, and the Second Circuit did not reject the\nproposition that this Court now adopts. Thus, the argument Goldman\nseeks to press on remand is unpre- served, and nothing in the\nSecond Circuit\u2019s opinion misstates the law. Because affirmance is\nappropriate under these circumstances, I respectfully dissent from\nPart II\u2013A\u20132 of the Court\u2019s opinion and from the judgment of the\nCourt.Notes1*Indeed, in a prior appeal in\nthis case, an earlier Second Circuit panel vacated an order of the\nDistrict Court in part because it had refused to consider\nprice-impact evidence that overlapped with materiality. See 879\nF.3d 474, 486 (2018) (holding that \u201c[a]lthough price impact touches\non materiality, which is not an appropriate consideration at the\nclass certification stage,\u201d courts nonetheless must consider\nevidence regarding \u201c[w]hether a misrepresentation was reflected in\nthe market price at the time of the transaction\u201d). It is hard to\nimagine that the Second Circuit here was unaware of (or intended to\ndepart from) the prior panel\u2019s holding.",
