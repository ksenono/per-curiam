Code Regs., tit. 8, \u00a720900(e)(1)(C) (2020). Agricultural\nemployers must allow union organizers onto their property for up to\nthree hours per day, 120 days per year. The question presented is\nwhether the access regulation constitutes aper\u00a0sephysical taking under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.IThe California Agricultural Labor Relations\nAct of 1975 gives agricultural employees a right to\nself-organization and makes it an unfair labor practice for\nemployers to interfere with that right. Cal. Lab. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a71152,\n1153(a) (West 2020). The state Agricultural Labor Relations Board\nhas promulgated a regulation providing, in its current form, that\nthe self-organization rights of employees include \u201cthe right of\naccess by union organizers to the premises of an agricultural\nemployer for the purpose of meeting and talking with employees and\nsoliciting their support.\u201d Cal. Code Regs., tit. 8, \u00a720900(e).\nUnder the regulation, a labor organization may \u201ctake access\u201d to an\nagricultural employer\u2019s property for up to four 30-day periods in\none calendar year. \u00a7\u00a720900(e)(1)(A), (B). In order to take access,\na labor organization must file a written notice with the Board and\nserve a copy on the employer. \u00a720900(e)(1)(B). Two organizers per\nwork crew (plus one additional organizer for every 15 workers over\n30 workers in a crew) may enter the employer\u2019s property for up to\none hour before work, one hour during the lunch break, and one hour\nafter work. \u00a7\u00a720900(e)(3)(A)\u2013(B), (4)(A). Organizers may not engage\nin disruptive conduct, but are otherwise free to meet and talk with\nemployees as they wish. \u00a7\u00a720900(e)(3)(A), (4)(C). Interference with\norganizers\u2019 right of access may constitute an unfair labor\npractice, \u00a720900(e)(5)(C), which can result in sanctions against\nthe employer, see,e.g.,Harry Carian Salesv.Agricultural Labor Relations Bd.,39 Cal. 3d 209, 231\u2013232,703 P.2d 27, 42 (1985).Cedar Point Nursery is a strawberry grower in\nnorthern California. It employs over 400 seasonal workers and\naround 100 full-time workers, none of whom live on the property.\nAccording to the complaint, in October 2015, at five o\u2019clock one\nmorning, members of the United Farm Workers entered Cedar Point\u2019s\nproperty without prior notice. The organizers moved to the\nnursery\u2019s trim shed, where hundreds of workers were preparing\nstrawberry plants. Calling through bullhorns, the organizers\ndisturbed operations, causing some workers to join the organizers\nin a protest and others to leave the worksite altogether. Cedar\nPoint filed a charge against the union for taking access without\ngiving notice. The union responded with a charge of its own,\nalleging that Cedar Point had committed an unfair labor\npractice.Fowler Packing Company is a Fresno-based grower\nand shipper of table grapes and citrus. It has 1,800 to 2,500\nemployees in its field operations and around 500 in its packing\nfacility. As with Cedar Point, none of Fowler\u2019s workers live on the\npremises. In July 2015, organizers from the United Farm Workers\nattempted to take access to Fowler\u2019s property, but the company\nblocked them from entering. The union filed an unfair labor\npractice charge against Fowler, which it later withdrew.Believing that the union would likely attempt to\nenter their property again in the near future, the growers filed\nsuit in Federal District Court against several Board members in\ntheir official capacity. The growers argued that the access\nregulation effected an unconstitutionalper\u00a0sephysical\ntaking under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments by appropriating\nwithout compensation an easement for union organizers to enter\ntheir property. They requested declaratory and injunctive relief\nprohibiting the Board from enforcing the regulation against\nthem.The District Court denied the growers\u2019 motion\nfor a preliminary injunction and granted the Board\u2019s motion to\ndismiss. The court rejected the growers\u2019 argument that the access\nregulation constituted aper\u00a0sephysical taking,\nreasoning that it did not \u201callow the public to access their\nproperty in a permanent and continuous manner for whatever reason.\u201dCedar Point Nurseryv.Gould, 2016 WL 1559271, *5 (ED\nCal., Apr. 18, 2016) (emphasis deleted). In the court\u2019s view, the\nregulation was instead subject to evaluation under the multifactor\nbalancing test ofPenn Central Transportation Co.v.New\nYork City,438 U.S.\n104(1978), which the growers had made no attempt to satisfy.Cedar Point Nurseryv.Gould, 2016 WL 3549408, *4 (ED\nCal., June 29, 2016).A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the\nNinth Circuit affirmed. The court identified three categories of\nregulatory actions in takings jurisprudence: regulations that\nimpose permanent physical invasions, regulations that deprive an\nowner of all economically beneficial use of his property, and the\nremainder of regulatory actions.Cedar Point Nurseryv.Shiroma, 923 F.3d 524, 530\u2013531 (2019). On the court\u2019s\nunderstanding, while regulations in the first two categories\nconstituteper\u00a0setakings, those in the third must be\nevaluated underPenn Central. 923 F.\u00a03d, at 531. The\ncourt agreed with the District Court that the access regulation did\nnot fall into the first category because it did not \u201callow random\nmembers of the public to unpredictably traverse [the growers\u2019]\nproperty 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.\u201dId., at 532. And\ngiven that the growers did not contend that the regulation deprived\nthem of all economically beneficial use of their property,per\u00a0setreatment was inappropriate.Id., at 531,\n534.Judge Leavy dissented. He observed that this\nCourt had never allowed labor organizers to enter an employer\u2019s\nproperty for substantial periods of time when its employees lived\noff premises.Id., at 536; seeLechmere, Inc.v.NLRB,502 U.S.\n527, 540\u2013541 (1992);NLRBv.Babcock & Wilcox\nCo.,351 U.S.\n105, 113 (1956). As he saw it, the regulation constituted a\nphysical occupation and therefore effected aper\u00a0setaking. 923 F.\u00a03d, at 538.The Ninth Circuit denied rehearing en banc.\nJudge Ikuta dissented, joined by seven other judges. She reasoned\nthat the access regulation appropriated from the growers a\ntraditional form of private property\u2014an easement in gross\u2014and\ntransferred that property to union organizers.Cedar Point\nNurseryv.Shiroma, 956 F.3d 1162, 1168, 1171 (2020).\nThe appropriation of such an easement, she concluded, constituted aper\u00a0sephysical taking under the precedents of this\nCourt.Id., at 1168.We granted certiorari. 592 U.\u00a0S. ___\n(2020).IIAThe Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment,\napplicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment,\nprovides: \u201c[N]or shall private property be taken for public use,\nwithout just compensation.\u201d The Founders recognized that the\nprotection of private property is indispensable to the promotion of\nindividual freedom. As John Adams tersely put it, \u201c[p]roperty must\nbe secured, or liberty cannot exist.\u201d Discourses on Davila, in 6\nWorks of John Adams 280 (C. Adams ed. 1851). This Court agrees,\nhaving noted that protection of property rights is \u201cnecessary to\npreserve freedom\u201d and \u201cempowers persons to shape and to plan their\nown destiny in a world where governments are always eager to do so\nfor them.\u201dMurrv.Wisconsin, 582 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___\n(2017) (slip op., at 8).When the government physically acquires private\nproperty for a public use, the Takings Clause imposes a clear and\ncategorical obligation to provide the owner with just compensation.Tahoe-Sierra Preservation Council, Inc.v.Tahoe Regional\nPlanning Agency,535 U.S.\n302, 321 (2002). The Court\u2019s physical takings jurisprudence is\n\u201cas old as the Republic.\u201dId., at 322. The government\ncommits a physical taking when it uses its power of eminent domain\nto formally condemn property. SeeUnited Statesv.General Motors Corp.,323 U.S.\n373, 374\u2013375 (1945);United States ex rel. TVAv.Powelson,319 U.S.\n266, 270\u2013271 (1943). The same is true when the government\nphysically takes possession of property without acquiring title to\nit. SeeUnited Statesv.Pewee Coal Co.,341 U.S.\n114, 115\u2013117 (1951) (plurality opinion). And the government\nlikewise effects a physical taking when it occupies property\u2014say,\nby recurring flooding as a result of building a dam. SeeUnited\nStatesv.Cress,243 U.S.\n316, 327\u2013328 (1917). These sorts of physical appropriations\nconstitute the \u201cclearest sort of taking,\u201dPalazzolov.Rhode Island,533 U.S.\n606, 617 (2001), and we assess them using a simple,per\u00a0serule: The government must pay for what it takes.\nSeeTahoe-Sierra, 535 U.\u00a0S., at 322.When the government, rather than appropriating\nprivate property for itself or a third party, instead imposes\nregulations that restrict an owner\u2019s ability to use his own\nproperty, a different standard applies.Id., at 321\u2013322. Our\njurisprudence governing such use restrictions has developed more\nrecently. Before the 20th century, the Takings Clause was\nunderstood to be limited to physical appropriations of property.\nSeeHornev.Department of Agriculture, 576 U.S. 351,\n360 (2015);Legal Tender Cases, 12 Wall. 457, 551 (1871). InPennsylvania Coal Co.v.Mahon,260 U.S.\n393(1922), however, the Court established the proposition that\n\u201cwhile property may be regulated to a certain extent, if regulation\ngoes too far it will be recognized as a taking.\u201dId., at\n415. This framework now applies to use restrictions as varied as\nzoning ordinances,Village of Euclidv.Ambler Realty\nCo.,272 U.S.\n365, 387\u2013388 (1926), orders barring the mining of gold,United Statesv.Central Eureka Mining Co.,357 U.S.\n155, 168 (1958), and regulations prohibiting the sale of eagle\nfeathers,Andrusv.Allard,444 U.S.\n51, 65\u201366 (1979). To determine whether a use restriction\neffects a taking, this Court has generally applied the flexible\ntest developed inPenn Central, balancing factors such as\nthe economic impact of the regulation, its interference with\nreasonable investment-backed expectations, and the character of the\ngovernment action. 438 U.\u00a0S., at 124.Our cases have often described use restrictions\nthat go \u201ctoo far\u201d as \u201cregulatory takings.\u201d See,e.g.,Horne, 576 U.\u00a0S., at 360;Yeev.Escondido,503 U.S.\n519, 527 (1992). But that label can mislead. Government action\nthat physically appropriates property is no less a physical taking\nbecause it arises from a regulation. That explains why we held that\nan administrative reserve requirement compelling raisin growers to\nphysically set aside a percentage of their crop for the government\nconstituted a physical rather than a regulatory taking.Horne, 576 U.\u00a0S., at 361. The essential question is\nnot, as the Ninth Circuit seemed to think, whether the government\naction at issue comes garbed as a regulation (or statute, or\nordinance, or miscellaneous decree). It is whether the government\nhas physically taken property for itself or someone else\u2014by\nwhatever means\u2014or has instead restricted a property owner\u2019s ability\nto use his own property. SeeTahoe-Sierra, 535 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 321\u2013323. Whenever a regulation results in a physical\nappropriation of property, aper\u00a0setaking has\noccurred, andPenn Centralhas no place.BThe access regulation appropriates a right to\ninvade the growers\u2019 property and therefore constitutes aper\u00a0sephysical taking. The regulation grants union\norganizers a right to physically enter and occupy the growers\u2019 land\nfor three hours per day, 120 days per year. Rather than restraining\nthe growers\u2019 use of their own property, the regulation appropriates\nfor the enjoyment of third parties the owners\u2019 right to\nexclude.The right to exclude is \u201cone of the most\ntreasured\u201d rights of property ownership.Lorettov.Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp.,458\nU.S. 419, 435 (1982). According to Blackstone, the very idea of\nproperty entails \u201cthat sole and despotic dominion which one man\nclaims and exercises over the external things of the world, in\ntotal exclusion of the right of any other individual in the\nuniverse.\u201d 2 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 2\n(1766). In less exuberant terms, we have stated that the right to\nexclude is \u201cuniversally held to be a fundamental element of the\nproperty right,\u201d and is \u201cone of the most essential sticks in the\nbundle of rights that are commonly characterized as property.\u201dKaiser Aetnav.United States,444 U.S.\n164, 176, 179\u2013180 (1979); seeDolanv.City of\nTigard,512 U.S.\n374, 384, 393 (1994);Nollanv.California Coastal\nComm\u2019n,483 U.S.\n825, 831 (1987); see also Merrill, Property and the Right to\nExclude, 77 Neb. L.\u00a0Rev. 730 (1998) (calling the right to\nexclude the \u201csine qua non\u201d of property).Given the central importance to property\nownership of the right to exclude, it comes as little surprise that\nthe Court has long treated government-authorized physical invasions\nas takings requiring just compensation. The Court has often\ndescribed the property interest taken as a servitude or an\neasement.For example, inUnited Statesv.Causbywe held that the invasion of private property by\noverflights effected a taking.328 U.S.\n256(1946). The government frequently flew military aircraft\nlow over the Causby farm, grazing the treetops and terrorizing the\npoultry.Id., at 259. The Court observed that ownership of\nthe land extended to airspace that low, and that \u201cinvasions of it\nare in the same category as invasions of the surface.\u201dId.,\nat 265. Because the damages suffered by the Causbys \u201cwere the\nproduct of a direct invasion of [their] domain,\u201d we held that \u201ca\nservitude has been imposed upon the land.\u201dId., at 265\u2013266,\n267; see alsoPortsmouth Harbor Land & Hotel Co.v.United States,260 U.S.\n327, 330 (1922) (government assertion of a right to fire\ncoastal defense guns across private property would constitute a\ntaking).We similarly held that the appropriation of an\neasement effected a taking inKaiser Aetnav.United\nStates. A real-estate developer dredged a pond, converted it\ninto a marina, and connected it to a nearby bay and the ocean. 444\nU.\u00a0S., at 167. The government asserted that the developer\ncould not exclude the public from the marina because the pond had\nbecome a navigable water.Id., at 168. We held that the\nright to exclude \u201cfalls within [the] category of interests that the\nGovernment cannot take without compensation.\u201dId., at 180.\nAfter noting that \u201cthe imposition of the navigational servitude\u201d\nwould \u201cresult in an actual physical invasion of the privately owned\nmarina\u201d by members of the public, we citedCausbyandPortsmouthfor the proposition that \u201ceven if the Government\nphysically invades only an easement in property, it must\nnonetheless pay just compensation.\u201d 444 U.\u00a0S., at 180.InLorettov.Teleprompter Manhattan\nCATV Corp., we made clear that a permanent physical occupation\nconstitutes aper\u00a0setaking regardless whether it\nresults in only a trivial economic loss. New York adopted a law\nrequiring landlords to allow cable companies to install equipment\non their properties. 458 U.\u00a0S., at 423. Loretto alleged that\nthe installation of a \u00bd-inch diameter cable and two 1\u00bd-cubic-foot\nboxes on her roof caused a taking.Id., at 424. We agreed,\nstating that where government action results in a \u201cpermanent\nphysical occupation of property, our cases uniformly have found a\ntaking to the extent of the occupation, without regard to whether\nthe action achieves an important public benefit or has only minimal\neconomic impact on the owner.\u201dId., at 434\u2013435.We reiterated that the appropriation of an\neasement constitutes a physical taking inNollanv.California Coastal Commission. The Nollans sought a permit\nto build a larger home on their beachfront lot. 483 U.\u00a0S., at\n828. The California Coastal Commission issued the permit subject to\nthe condition that the Nollans grant the public an easement to pass\nthrough their property along the beach.Ibid.As a starting\npoint to our analysis, we explained that, had the Commission simply\nrequired the Nollans to grant the public an easement across their\nproperty, \u201cwe have no doubt there would have been a taking.\u201dId., at 831; see alsoDolan, 512 U.\u00a0S., at 384\n(holding that compelled dedication of an easement for public use\nwould constitute a taking).More recently, inHornev.Department\nof Agriculture, we observed that \u201cpeople still do not expect\ntheir property, real or personal, to be actually occupied or taken\naway.\u201d 576 U.\u00a0S., at 361. The physical appropriation by the\ngovernment of the raisins in that case was aper\u00a0setaking, even if a regulatory limit with the same economic impact\nwould not have been.Id., at 362; seesupra, at 6.\n\u201cThe Constitution,\u201d we explained, \u201cis concerned with means as well\nas ends.\u201d 576 U.\u00a0S., at 362.The upshot of this line of precedent is that\ngovernment-authorized invasions of property\u2014whether by plane, boat,\ncable, or beachcomber\u2014are physical takings requiring just\ncompensation. As in those cases, the government here has\nappropriated a right of access to the growers\u2019 property, allowing\nunion organizers to traverse it at will for three hours a day, 120\ndays a year. The regulation appropriates a right to physically\ninvade the growers\u2019 property\u2014to literally \u201ctake access,\u201d as the\nregulation provides. Cal. Code Regs., tit. 8, \u00a720900(e)(1)(C). It\nis therefore aper\u00a0sephysical taking under our\nprecedents. Accordingly, the growers\u2019 complaint states a claim for\nan uncompensated taking in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth\nAmendments.CThe Ninth Circuit saw matters differently, as\ndo the Board and the dissent. In the decision below, the Ninth\nCircuit took the view that the access regulation did not qualify as\naper\u00a0setaking because, although it grants a right to\nphysically invade the growers\u2019 property, it does not allow for\npermanent and continuous access \u201c24 hours a day, 365 days a year.\u201d\n923 F.\u00a03d, at 532 (citingNollan, 483 U.\u00a0S., at\n832). The dissent likewise concludes that the regulation cannot\namount to aper\u00a0setaking because it allows \u201caccess\nshort of 365 days a year.\u201dPost, at 11 (opinion of Breyer,\nJ.). That position is insupportable as a matter of precedent and\ncommon sense. There is no reason the law should analyze an\nabrogation of the right to exclude in one manner if it extends for\n365 days, but in an entirely different manner if it lasts for\n364.To begin with, we have held that a physical\nappropriation is a taking whether it is permanent or temporary. Our\ncases establish that \u201ccompensation is mandated when a leasehold is\ntaken and the government occupies property for its own purposes,\neven though that use is temporary.\u201dTahoe-Sierra, 535\nU.\u00a0S., at 322 (citingGeneral Motors Corp.,323 U.S.\n373;United Statesv.Petty Motor Co.,327 U.S.\n372(1946)). The duration of an appropriation\u2014just like the\nsize of an appropriation, seeLoretto, 458 U.\u00a0S., at\n436\u2013437\u2014bears only on the amount of compensation. SeeUnited\nStatesv.Dow,357 U.S.\n17, 26 (1958). For example, after finding a taking by physical\ninvasion, the Court inCausbyremanded the case to the lower\ncourt to determine \u201cwhether the easement taken was temporary or\npermanent,\u201d in order to fix the compensation due. 328 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 267\u2013268.To be sure,Lorettoemphasized the\nheightened concerns associated with \u201c[t]he permanence and absolute\nexclusivity of a physical occupation\u201d in contrast to \u201ctemporary\nlimitations on the right to exclude,\u201d and stated that \u201c[n]ot every\nphysicalinvasionis a taking.\u201d 458 U.\u00a0S., at 435,\nn.\u00a012; see alsoid., at 432\u2013435. The latter point is\nwell taken, as we will explain. ButNollanclarified that\nappropriation of a right to physically invade property may\nconstitute a taking \u201ceven though no particular individual is\npermitted to station himself permanently upon the premises.\u201d 483\nU.\u00a0S., at 832.Next, we have recognized that physical invasions\nconstitute takings even if they are intermittent as opposed to\ncontinuous.Causbyheld that overflights of private property\neffected a taking, even though they occurred on only 4% of takeoffs\nand 7% of landings at the nearby airport. 328 U.\u00a0S., at 259.\nAnd whileNollanhappened to involve a legally continuous\nright of access, we have no doubt that the Court would have reached\nthe same conclusion if the easement demanded by the Commission had\nlasted for only 364 days per year. After all, the easement was\nhardly continuous as a practical matter. As Justice Brennan\nobserved in dissent, given the shifting tides, \u201cpublic passage for\na portion of the year would either be impossible or would not occur\non [the Nollans\u2019] property.\u201d 483 U.\u00a0S., at 854. What matters\nis not that the easement notionally ran round the clock, but that\nthe government had taken a right to physically invade the Nollans\u2019\nland. And when the government physically takes an interest in\nproperty, it must pay for the right to do so. SeeHorne, 576\nU.\u00a0S., at 357\u2013358;Tahoe-Sierra, 535 U.\u00a0S., at\n322. The fact that a right to take access is exercised only from\ntime to time does not make it any less a physical taking.Even the Board declines to defend the Ninth\nCircuit\u2019s absolutist stance. It prudently concedes that \u201ca\nrequirement that landowners grant an easement otherwise identical\nto the one inNollanbut limited to daylight hours, might\nvery well qualify as \u2018a taking without regard to other factors that\na court might ordinarily examine.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Brief for Respondents\n25\u201326 (quotingLoretto, 458 U.\u00a0S., at 432; citation and\nsome internal quotation marks omitted). But the access regulation,\nit contends, nevertheless fails to qualify as aper\u00a0setaking because it \u201cauthorizes only limited and intermittent access\nfor a narrow purpose.\u201d Brief for Respondents 26. That position is\nlittle more defensible than the Ninth Circuit\u2019s. The fact that the\nregulation grants access only to union organizers and only for a\nlimited time does not transform it from a physical taking into a\nuse restriction. Saying that appropriation of a three hour per day,\n120 day per year right to invade the growers\u2019 premises \u201cdoes not\nconstitute a taking of a property interest but rather\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. a mere restriction on its use, is to use words in a\nmanner that deprives them of all their ordinary meaning.\u201dNollan, 483 U.\u00a0S., at 831 (citation and internal\nquotation marks omitted).The Board also takes issue with the growers\u2019\npremise that the access regulation appropriates an easement. In the\nBoard\u2019s estimation, the regulation does not exact a true easement\nin gross under California law because the access right may not be\ntransferred, does not burden any particular parcel of property, and\nmay not be recorded. This, the Board says, reinforces its\nconclusion that the regulation does not take a constitutionally\nprotected property interest from the growers. The dissent agrees,\nsuggesting that the access right cannot effect aper\u00a0setaking because it does not require the growers to grant the union\norganizers an easement as defined by state property law. Seepost, at 4, 11.These arguments misconstrue our physical takings\ndoctrine. As a general matter, it is true that the property rights\nprotected by the Takings Clause are creatures of state law. SeePhillipsv.Washington Legal Foundation,524 U.S.\n156, 164 (1998);Lucasv.South Carolina Coastal\nCouncil,505 U.S.\n1003, 1030 (1992). But no one disputes that, without the access\nregulation, the growers would have had the right under California\nlaw to exclude union organizers from their property. SeeAllredv.Harris,14 Cal. App. 4th 1386, 1390,18 Cal. Rptr. 2d 530, 533 (1993). And no one disputes that the\naccess regulation took that right from them. The Board cannot\nabsolve itself of takings liability by appropriating the growers\u2019\nright to exclude in a form that is a slight mismatch from state\neasement law. Under the Constitution, property rights \u201ccannot be so\neasily manipulated.\u201dHorne, 576 U.\u00a0S., at 365 (internal\nquotation marks omitted); see alsoWebb\u2019s Fabulous Pharmacies,\nInc.v.Beckwith,449 U.S.\n155, 164 (1980) (\u201ca State, byipse dixit, may not\ntransform private property into public property without\ncompensation\u201d).Our decisions consistently reflect this\nintuitive approach. We have recognized that the government can\ncommit a physical taking either by appropriating property through a\ncondemnation proceeding or by simply \u201center[ing] into physical\npossession of property without authority of a court order.\u201dDow, 357 U.\u00a0S., at 21; see alsoUnited Statesv.Clarke,445 U.S.\n253, 256\u2013257, and n. 3 (1980). In the latter situation, the\ngovernment\u2019s intrusion does not vest it with a property interest\nrecognized by state law, such as a fee simple or a leasehold. SeeDow, 357 U.\u00a0S., at 21. Yet we recognize a physical\ntaking all the same. Seeid., at 22. Any other result would\nallow the government to appropriate private property without just\ncompensation so long as it avoids formal condemnation. We have\nnever tolerated that outcome. SeePewee Coal Co., 341\nU.\u00a0S., at 116\u2013117. For much the same reason, inPortsmouth,Causby, andLorettowe never\npaused to consider whether the physical invasions at issue vested\nthe intruders with formal easements according to the nuances of\nstate property law (nor do we see how they could have). Instead, we\nfollowed our traditional rule: Because the government appropriated\na right to invade, compensation was due. That same test governs\nhere.The Board and the dissent further contend that\nour decision inPruneYard Shopping Centerv.Robins,447 U.S.\n74(1980), establishes that the access regulation cannot\nqualify as aper\u00a0setaking. There the California\nSupreme Court held that the State Constitution protected the right\nto engage in leafleting at the PruneYard, a privately owned\nshopping center.Id., at 78. The shopping center argued that\nthe decision had taken without just compensation its right to\nexclude.Id., at 82. Applying thePenn Centralfactors, we held that no compensable taking had occurred. 447\nU.\u00a0S., at 83; cf.Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc.v.United States,379 U.S.\n241, 261 (1964) (rejecting claim that provisions of the Civil\nRights Act of 1964 prohibiting racial discrimination in public\naccommodations effected a taking).The Board and the dissent argue thatPruneYardshows that limited rights of access to private\nproperty should be evaluated as regulatory rather thanper\u00a0setakings. Seepost, at 8\u20139. We disagree.\nUnlike the growers\u2019 properties, the PruneYard was open to the\npublic, welcoming some 25,000 patrons a day. 447 U.\u00a0S., at\n77\u201378. Limitations on how a business generally open to the public\nmay treat individuals on the premises are readily distinguishable\nfrom regulations granting a right to invade property closed to the\npublic. SeeHorne, 576 U.\u00a0S., at 364 (distinguishingPruneYardas involving \u201can already publicly accessible\u201d\nbusiness);Nollan, 483 U.\u00a0S., at 832, n. 1 (same).The Board also relies on our decision inNLRBv.Babcock & Wilcox Co. But that reliance is\nmisplaced. InBabcock, the National Labor Relations Board\nfound that several employers had committed unfair labor practices\nunder the National Labor Relations Act by preventing union\norganizers from distributing literature on company property. 351\nU.\u00a0S., at 109. We held that the statute did not require\nemployers to allow organizers onto their property, at least outside\nthe unusual circumstance where their employees were otherwise\n\u201cbeyond the reach of reasonable union efforts to communicate with\nthem.\u201dId., at 113; see alsoLechmere, 502\nU.\u00a0S., at 540 (employees residing off company property are\npresumptively not beyond the reach of the union\u2019s message). The\nBoard contends thatBabcock\u2019s approach of balancing property\nand organizational rights should guide our analysis here. SeeLoretto, 458 U.\u00a0S., at 434, n.\u00a011 (discussingBabcockprinciple). ButBabcockdid not involve a\ntakings claim. Whatever specific takings issues may be presented by\nthe highly contingent access right we recognized under the NLRA,\nCalifornia\u2019s access regulation effects aper\u00a0sephysical taking under our precedents. SeeTahoe-Sierra, 535\nU.\u00a0S., at 322.DIn its thoughtful opinion, the dissent advances\na distinctive view of property rights. The dissent encourages\nreaders to consider the issue \u201cthrough the lens of ordinary\nEnglish,\u201d and contends that, so viewed, the \u201cregulation does notappropriateanything.\u201dPost, at 3, 5. Rather, the\naccess regulation merely \u201cregulates.\u00a0.\u00a0. the\nowners\u2019 right to exclude,\u201d so it must be assessed \u201cunderPenn\nCentral\u2019s fact-intensive test.\u201dPost, at 2, 5. \u201cA right\nto enter my woods only on certain occasions,\u201d the dissent\nelaborates, \u201cis a taking only if the regulation allowing it goes\n\u2018too far.\u2019\u00a0\u201dPost, at 11. The dissent contends that our\ndecisions inCausby,Portsmouth, andKaiser\nAetnaapplied just such a flexible approach, under which the\nCourt \u201cbalanced several factors\u201d to determine whether the physical\ninvasions at issue effected a taking.Post, at 9\u201311.\nAccording to the dissent, this kind of latitude toward temporary\ninvasions is a practical necessity for governing in our complex\nmodern world. Seepost, at 11\u201312.With respect, our own understanding of the role\nof property rights in our constitutional order is markedly\ndifferent. In \u201cordinary English\u201d \u201cappropriation\u201d means\n\u201ctakingas one\u2019s own,\u201d 1 Oxford English Dictionary 587 (2d\ned. 1989) (emphasis added), and the regulation expressly grants to\nlabor organizers the \u201cright totakeaccess,\u201d Cal. Code\nRegs., tit. 8, \u00a720900(e)(1)(C) (emphasis added). We cannot agree\nthat the right to exclude is an empty formality, subject to\nmodification at the government\u2019s pleasure. On the contrary, it is a\n\u201cfundamental element of the property right,\u201dKaiser Aetna,\n444 U.\u00a0S., at 179\u2013180, that cannot be balanced away. Our cases\nestablish that appropriations of a right to invade areper\u00a0sephysical takings, not use restrictions subject\ntoPenn Central: \u201c[W]hen [government] planes use private\nairspace to approach a government airport, [the government] is\nrequired to pay for that share no matter how small.\u201dTahoe-Sierra, 535 U.\u00a0S., at 322 (citingCausby).\nAnd whileKaiser Aetnamay have referred to the test fromPenn Central, see 444 U.\u00a0S., at 174\u2013175, the Court\nconcluded categorically that the government must pay just\ncompensation for physical invasions, seeid., at 180 (citingCausbyandPortsmouth). With regard to the\ncomplexities of modern society, we think they only reinforce the\nimportance of safeguarding the basic property rights that help\npreserve individual liberty, as the Founders explained. Seesupra, at 5.In the end, the dissent\u2019s permissive approach to\nproperty rights hearkens back to views expressed (in dissent) for\ndecades. See,e.g.,Nollan, 483 U.\u00a0S., at 864\n(Brennan, J., dissenting) (\u201c[The Court\u2019s] reasoning is hardly\nsuited to the complex reality of natural resource protection in the\n20th century.\u201d);Loretto, 458 U.\u00a0S., at 455 (Blackmun,\nJ., dissenting) (\u201c[T]oday\u2019s decision .\u00a0.\u00a0. represents an\narchaic judicial response to a modern social problem.\u201d);Causby, 328 U.\u00a0S., at 275 (Black, J., dissenting)\n(\u201cToday\u2019s opinion is, I fear, an opening wedge for an unwarranted\njudicial interference with the power of Congress to develop\nsolutions for new and vital national problems.\u201d). As for today\u2019s\nconsidered dissent, it concludes with \u201cBetter the devil we know\n.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0,\u201dpost, at 16, but its objections, to\nborrow from then-Justice Rehnquist\u2019s invocation of Wordsworth,\n\u201cbear[\u00a0] the sound of \u2018Old, unhappy, far-off things, and\nbattles long ago,\u2019\u00a0\u201dKaiser Aetna, 444 U.\u00a0S., at\n177.IIIThe Board, seconded by the dissent, warns that\ntreating the access regulation as aper\u00a0sephysical\ntaking will endanger a host of state and federal government\nactivities involving entry onto private property. Seepost,\nat 11\u201314. That fear is unfounded.First, our holding does nothing to efface\nthe distinction between trespass and takings. Isolated physical\ninvasions, not undertaken pursuant to a granted right of access,\nare properly assessed as individual torts rather than\nappropriations of a property right. This basic distinction is\nfirmly grounded in our precedent. SeePortsmouth, 260\nU.\u00a0S., at 329\u2013330 (\u201c[W]hile a single act may not be enough, a\ncontinuance of them in sufficient number and for a sufficient time\nmay prove [the intent to take property]. Every successive trespass\nadds to the force of the evidence.\u201d); 1 P. Nichols, The Law of\nEminent Domain \u00a7112, p.\u00a0311 (1917) (\u201c[A] mere occasional\ntrespass would not constitute a taking.\u201d). And lower courts have\nhad little trouble applying it. See,e.g.,Hendlerv.United States, 952 F.2d 1364, 1377 (CA Fed. 1991)\n(identifying a \u201ctruckdriver parking on someone\u2019s vacant land to eat\nlunch\u201d as an example of a mere trespass).The distinction between trespass and takings\naccounts for our treatment of temporary government-induced flooding\ninArkansas Game and Fish Commissionv.United\nStates,568 U.S.\n23(2012). There we held, \u201csimply and only,\u201d that such flooding\n\u201cgains no automatic exemption from Takings Clause inspection.\u201dId., at 38. Because this type of flooding can present\ncomplex questions of causation, we instructed lower courts\nevaluating takings claims based on temporary flooding to consider a\nrange of factors including the duration of the invasion, the degree\nto which it was intended or foreseeable, and the character of the\nland at issue.Id., at 38\u201339. Applying those factors on\nremand, the Federal Circuit concluded that the government had\neffected a taking in the form of a temporary flowage easement.Arkansas Game and Fish Comm\u2019nv.United States, 736\nF.3d 1364, 1372 (2013). Our approach inArkansas Game and Fish\nCommissionreflects nothing more than an application of the\ntraditional trespass-versus-takings distinction to the unique\nconsiderations that accompany temporary flooding.Second, many government-authorized\nphysical invasions will not amount to takings because they are\nconsistent with longstanding background restrictions on property\nrights. As we explained inLucasv.South Carolina\nCoastal Council, the government does not take a property\ninterest when it merely asserts a \u201cpre-existing limitation upon the\nland owner\u2019s title.\u201d 505 U.\u00a0S., at 1028\u20131029. For example, the\ngovernment owes a landowner no compensation for requiring him to\nabate a nuisance on his property, because he never had a right to\nengage in the nuisance in the first place. Seeid., at\n1029\u20131030.These background limitations also encompass\ntraditional common law privileges to access private property. One\nsuch privilege allowed individuals to enter property in the event\nof public or private necessity. See Restatement (Second) of Torts\n\u00a7196 (1964) (entry to avert an imminent public disaster); \u00a7197\n(entry to avert serious harm to a person, land, or chattels); cf.Lucas, 505 U.\u00a0S., at 1029, n.\u00a016. The common law\nalso recognized a privilege to enter property to effect an arrest\nor enforce the criminal law under certain circumstances.\nRestatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7\u00a7204\u2013205. Because a property owner\ntraditionally had no right to exclude an official engaged in a\nreasonable search, see,e.g.,Sandfordv.Nichols, 13 Mass. 286, 288 (1816), government searches that\nare consistent with the Fourth Amendment and state law cannot be\nsaid to take any property right from landowners. See generallyCamarav.Municipal Court of City and County of San\nFrancisco,387 U.S.\n523, 538 (1967).Third, the government may require\nproperty owners to cede a right of access as a condition of\nreceiving certain benefits, without causing a taking. InNollan, we held that \u201ca permit condition that serves the\nsame legitimate police-power purpose as a refusal to issue the\npermit should not be found to be a taking if the refusal to issue\nthe permit would not constitute a taking.\u201d 483 U.\u00a0S., at 836.\nThe inquiry, we later explained, is whether the permit condition\nbears an \u201cessential nexus\u201d and \u201crough proportionality\u201d to the\nimpact of the proposed use of the property.Dolan, 512\nU.\u00a0S., at 386, 391; see alsoKoontzv.St. Johns\nRiver Water Management Dist.,570 U.S.\n595, 599 (2013).Under this framework, government health and\nsafety inspection regimes will generally not constitute takings.\nSee,e.g.,Ruckelshausv.Monsanto Co.,467 U.S.\n986, 1007 (1984). When the government conditions the grant of a\nbenefit such as a permit, license, or registration on allowing\naccess for reasonable health and safety inspections, both the nexus\nand rough proportionality requirements of the constitutional\nconditions framework should not be difficult to satisfy. See,e.g., 7 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7136g(a)(1)(A) (pesticide\ninspections); 16 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7823b(a) (hydroelectric project\ninvestigations); 21 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7374(a)(1) (pharmaceutical\ninspections); 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72201(o) (nuclear\nmaterial inspections). None of these considerations undermine our\ndetermination that the access regulation here gives rise to aper\u00a0sephysical taking. Unlike a mere trespass, the\nregulation grants a formal entitlement to physically invade the\ngrowers\u2019 land. Unlike a law enforcement search, no traditional\nbackground principle of property law requires the growers to admit\nunion organizers onto their premises. And unlike standard health\nand safety inspections, the access regulation is not germane to any\nbenefit provided to agricultural employers or any risk posed to the\npublic. SeeHorne, 576 U.\u00a0S., at 366 (\u201cbasic and\nfamiliar uses of property\u201d are not a special benefit that \u201cthe\nGovernment may hold hostage, to be ransomed by the waiver of\nconstitutional protection\u201d). The access regulation amounts to\nsimple appropriation of private property.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*The access regulation grants labor\norganizations a right to invade the growers\u2019 property. It therefore\nconstitutes aper\u00a0sephysical taking.The judgment of the United States Court of\nAppeals for the Ninth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded\nfor further proceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.",
