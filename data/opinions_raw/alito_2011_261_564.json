B., PETITIONERv.NORTH CAROLINAon writ of certiorari to the supreme court of north\ncarolina[June 16, 2011]Justice Alito, with whom The\nChief Justice, Justice Scalia, and Justice Thomas join,\ndissenting.The Court\u2019s decision in this case\nmay seem on first consideration to be modest and sensible, but in\ntruth it is neither. It is fundamentally inconsistent with one of\nthe main justifications for theMiranda[Footnote 1]rule: the perceived need for a clear\nrule that can be easily applied in all cases. And today\u2019s holding\nis not needed to protect the constitutional rights of minors who\nare questioned by the police.Miranda\u2019s prophylactic regime places\na high value on clarity and certainty. Dissatisfied with the highly\nfact-specific constitutional rule against the admission of in-\nvoluntary confessions, theMirandaCourt set down rigid\nstandards that often require courts to ignore personal\ncharacteristics that may be highly relevant to a particular\nsuspect\u2019s actual susceptibility to police pressure. This rigidity,\nhowever, has brought with it one ofMiranda\u2019s principal\nstrengths\u2014\u201cthe ease and clarity of its application\u201d by law\nenforcement officials and courts. SeeMoranv.Burbine,475 U. S. 412, 425\u2013426\n(1986). A key contributor to this clarity, at least up until now,\nhas beenMiranda\u2019s objective reasonable-person test for\ndetermining custody.Miranda\u2019s custody requirement is\nbased on the proposition that the risk of unconstitutional coercion\nis heightened when a suspect is placed under formal arrest or is\nsubjected to some functionally equivalent limitation on freedom of\nmovement. When this custodial threshold is reached,Mirandawarnings must precede police questioning. But in\nthe interest of simplicity, the custody analysis considers only\nwhether, under the circumstances, a hypothetical reasonable person\nwould consider himself to be confined.Many suspects, of course, will differ from\nthis hypothetical reasonable person. Some, including those who have\nbeen hardened by past interrogations, may have no need forMirandawarnings at all. And for other suspects\u2014those who\nare unusually sensitive to the pressures of police\nquestioning\u2014Mirandawarnings may come too late to be of\nany use. That is a necessary consequence ofMiranda\u2019s\nrigid standards, but it does not mean that the constitutional\nrights of these especially sensitive suspects are left unprotected.\nA vulnerable defendant can still turn to the constitutional rule\nagainstactualcoercion and contend that that his\nconfession was extracted against his will.Today\u2019s decision shifts theMirandacustody determination from a one-size-fits-all reasonable-person\ntest into an inquiry that must account for at least one\nindividualized characteristic\u2014age\u2014that is thought to correlate with\nsus-ceptibility to coercive pressures. Age, however, is in no way\nthe only personal characteristic that may correlate with\npliability, and in future cases the Court will be forced to choose\nbetween two unpalatable alternatives. It may choose to limit\ntoday\u2019s decision by arbitrarily distinguishing a suspect\u2019s age from\nother personal characteristics\u2014such as intelligence, education,\noccupation, or prior experience with law enforcement\u2014that may also\ncorrelate with susceptibility to coercive pressures. Or, if the\nCourt is unwilling to draw these arbitrary lines, it will be forced\nto effect a fundamental transformation of theMirandacustody test\u2014from a clear, easily applied prophylactic rule into a\nhighly fact-intensive standard resembling the voluntariness test\nthat theMirandaCourt found to be unsatisfactory.For at least three reasons, there is no need\nto go down this road. First, many minors subjected to police\ninterrogation are near the age of majority, and for these suspects\nthe one-size-fits-allMirandacustody rule may not be a\nbad fit. Second, many of the difficulties in applying theMirandacustody rule to minors arise because of the unique\ncircumstances present when the police conduct interrogations at\nschool. TheMirandacustody rule has always taken into\naccount the setting in which questioning occurs, and accounting for\nthe school setting in such cases will address many of these\nproblems. Third, in cases like the one now before us, where the\nsuspect is especially young, courts applying the constitutional\nvoluntariness standard can take special care to ensure that\nincriminating statements were not obtained through coercion.Safeguarding the constitutional rights of\nminors does not require the extreme makeover ofMirandathat today\u2019s decision may portend.IIn the days beforeMiranda, this Court\u2019s sole metric for evaluating the\nadmissibility of confessions was a voluntariness standard rooted in\nboth the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Self-Incrimination Clause and the Due\nProcess Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. SeeBramv.United States,168 U. S. 532, 542\n(1897) (Self-Incrimination Clause);Brownv.Mississippi,297 U. S. 278(1936)\n(due process). The question in these voluntariness cases was\nwhether the particular \u201cdefendant\u2019s will\u201d had been \u201coverborne.\u201dLynumnv.Illinois,372 U. S. 528, 534\n(1963). Courts took into account both \u201cthe details of the\ninterrogation\u201dand\u201cthe characteristics of the accused,\u201dSchnecklothv.Bustamonte,412 U. S. 218, 226\n(1973), and then \u201cweigh[ed] \u2026 the circumstances of pressure against\nthe power of resistance of the person confessing.\u201dSteinv.New York,346 U. S. 156, 185\n(1953).All manner of individualized,\npersonal characteristics were relevant in this voluntariness\ninquiry. Among the most frequently mentioned factors were the\ndefendant\u2019s education, physical condition, intelligence, and mental\nhealth.Withrowv.Williams,507 U. S. 680, 693 (1993); seeClewisv.Texas,386 U. S. 707, 712\n(1967) (\u201conly a fifth-grade education\u201d);Greenwaldv.Wisconsin,390 U. S. 519, 520\u2013521\n(1968)(per curiam)(had not taken blood-pressure\nmedication);Paynev.Arkansas,356 U. S. 560, 562,\nn.\u00a04, 567 (1958) (\u201cmentally dull\u201d and \u201c\u00a0\u2018slow to\nlearn\u2019\u00a0\u201d);Fikesv.Alabama,352 U. S. 191, 193, 196,\n198 (1957) (\u201clow mentality, if not mentally ill\u201d). The suspect\u2019s\nage also received prominent attention in several cases,e.g.,Gallegosv.Colorado,370 U. S. 49, 54 (1962),\nespecially when the suspect was a \u201cmere child.\u201dHaleyv.Ohio,332\nU. S. 596, 599 (1948) (plurality opinion). The weight assigned\nto any one consideration varied from case to case. But all of these\nfactors, along with anything else that might have affected the\n\u201cindividual\u2019s . . . capacity for effective choice,\u201d were relevant\nin determining whether the confession was coerced or compelled. SeeMirandav.Arizona,384 U. S. 436, 506\u2013507 (1966) (Harlan,\nJ., dissenting).The all-encompassing nature of the\nvoluntariness inquiry had its benefits. It allowed courts to\naccommodate a \u201ccomplex of values,\u201dSchneckloth,supra, at 223, 224, and to make a careful, highly\nindividualized determination as to whether the police had wrung \u201ca\nconfession out of [the] accused against his will.\u201dBlackburnv.Alabama,361 U. S. 199, 206\u2013207\n(1960). But with this flexibility came a decrease in both certainty\nand predictability, and the voluntariness standard proved difficult\n\u201cfor law enforcement officers to conform to, and for courts to\napply in a consistent manner.\u201dDickersonv.United\nStates,530 U. S. 428, 444 (2000).InMiranda, the Court supplemented\nthe voluntariness inquiry with a \u201cset of prophylactic measures\u201d\ndesigned to ward off the \u201c\u00a0\u2018inherently compelling pressures\u2019\nof custodial interrogation.\u201d SeeMarylandv.Shatzer, 559 U. S. __, __ (2010) (slip op., at 4) (quotingMiranda, 384 U. S., at 467).Mirandagreatly\nsimplified matters by requiring police to give suspects standard\nwarnings before commencing any custodial interrogation. Seeid.,at 479. Its requirements are no doubt \u201crigid,\u201d seeFarev.Michael C.,439 U. S. 1310, 1314\n(1978) (Rehnquist, J., in chambers), and they often require courts\nto suppress \u201ctrustworthy and highly probative\u201d statements that may\nbe perfectly \u201cvoluntary under [a] traditional Fifth Amendment\nanalysis.\u201dFarev.Michael C.,442 U. S. 707, 718\n(1979). But with this rigidity comes increased clarity.Mirandaprovides \u201ca workable rule to guide police\nofficers,\u201dNew Yorkv.Quarles,467 U. S. 649, 658 (1984) (internal\nquotation marks omitted), and an administrable standard for the\ncourts. As has often been recognized, this gain in clarity and\nadministrability is one ofMiranda\u2019s \u201cprincipal\nadvantages.\u201dBerkemerv.McCarty,468 U. S. 420, 430 (1984); see alsoMissouriv.Seibert,542 U. S. 600, 622\n(2004) (Kennedy, J., con-curring in judgment).No less than other facets ofMiranda,\nthe threshold requirement that the suspect be in \u201ccustody\u201d is\n\u201cdesigned to give clear guidance to the police.\u201dYarboroughv.Alvarado,541 U. S. 652, 668, 669\n(2004). Custody underMirandaattaches where there is a\n\u201cformal arrest\u201d or a \u201crestraint on freedom of movement\u201d akin to\nformal arrest.Californiav.Beheler,463 U. S. 1121, 1125 (1983)(per\ncuriam)(internal quotation marks omitted).This\nstandard is \u201cobjective\u201d and turns on how a hypothetical \u201creasonable\nperson in the position of the individual being questioned would\ngauge the breadth of his or her freedom of action.\u201dStansburyv.California,511 U. S. 318, 322\u2013323,\n325 (1994)(per curiam)(internal quotation marks\nomitted).Until today, the Court\u2019s cases applying this\ntest have focused solely on the \u201cobjective circumstances of the\ninterrogation,\u201did., at 323, not the personal\ncharacteristics of the interrogated.E.g.,Berkemer,supra, at 442, and n.\u00a035; but cf.Schneckloth, 412 U. S., at 226 (voluntariness inquiry\nrequires consideration of \u201cthe details of the interrogation\u201dand\u201cthe characteristics of the accused\u201d). Relevant\nfactors have included such things as where the questioning\noccurred,[Footnote 2] how long\nit lasted,[Footnote 3] what was\nsaid,[Footnote 4] any physical\nrestraints placed on the suspect\u2019s movement,[Footnote 5] and whether the suspect was allowed\nto leave when the questioning was through.[Footnote 6] The totality ofthesecircumstances\u2014the external circumstances, that is, of the\ninterrogation itself\u2014is what has mattered in this Court\u2019s cases.\nPersonal characteristics of suspects have consistently been\nrejected or ignored as irrelevant under a one-size-fits-all\nreasonable-person standard.Stansbury,supra,at\n323 (\u201c[C]ustody depends on the objective circumstances of the\ninterrogation, not on the subjective views harbored by either the\ninterrogating officers or the person being questioned\u201d).For example, inBerkemerv.McCarty, supra, police officers conducting a traffic stop\nquestioned a man who had been drinking and smoking marijuana before\nhe was pulled over.Id.,at 423. Although the suspect\u2019s\ninebriation was readily apparent to the officers at the scene,ibid., the Court\u2019s analysis did not advert to this or any\nother individualized consideration. Instead, the Court focused only\non the external circumstances of the interrogation itself. The\nopinion concluded that a typical \u201ctraffic stop\u201d is akin to a\n\u201cTerrystop\u201d[Footnote\n7] and does not qualify as the equivalent of \u201cformal arrest.\u201dId., at 439.Californiav.Beheler,supra, is another useful example. There, the circumstances\nof the interrogation were \u201cremarkably similar\u201d to the facts of the\nCourt\u2019s earlier decision inOregonv.Mathiason,429 U. S. 492(1977)(per\ncuriam)\u2014the suspect was \u201cnot placed under arrest,\u201d he\n\u201cvoluntarily [came] to the police station,\u201d and he was \u201callowed to\nleave unhindered by police after a brief interview.\u201d 463 U. S., at\n1123, 1121. A California court inBehelerhad nonetheless\ndistinguishedMathiasonbecause the police knew that\nBeheler \u201chad been drinking earlier in the day\u201d and was \u201cemotionally\ndistraught.\u201d 463 U. S., at 1124\u20131125. In a summary reversal, this\nCourt explained that the fact \u201c[t]hat the police knew more\u201d\npersonal information about Beheler than they did about Mathiason\nwas \u201cirrelevant.\u201dId., at 1125. Neither one of them was in\ncustody under the objective reasonable-person standard.Ibid.;see alsoAlvarado,supra,at 668, 669 (experience with law enforcement\nirrelevant toMirandacustody analysis \u201cas ade\nnovomatter\u201d).[Footnote\n8]The glaring absence of reliance on personal\ncharacteristics in these and other custody cases should come as no\nsurprise. To account for such individualized considerations would\nbe to contradictMiranda\u2019s central premise. TheMirandaCourt\u2019s decision to adopt its inflexible\nprophylactic requirements was expressly based on the notion that\n\u201c[a]ssessments of the knowledge the defendant possessed, based on\ninformation as to his age, education, intelligence, or prior\ncontact with authorities, can never be more than speculation.\u201d 384\nU. S., at 468\u2013469.IIIn light of this established\npractice, there is no denying that, by incorporating age into its\nanalysis, the Court is embarking on a new expansion of the\nestablished custody standard. And sinceMirandais this\nCourt\u2019s rule, \u201cnot a constitutional command,\u201d it is up to the Court\n\u201cto justify its expansion.\u201d Cf.Arizonav.Roberson,486 U. S. 675, 688\n(1988) (Kennedy, J., dissenting). This the Court fails to do.In its present form,Miranda\u2019s prophylactic regime already imposes \u201chigh\ncost[s]\u201d by requiring suppression of confessions that are often\n\u201chighly probative\u201d and \u201cvoluntary\u201d by any traditional standard.Oregonv.Elstad,470 U. S. 298, 312\n(1985); seeDickerson,530 U. S., at 444 (underMiranda\u201cstatements which may be by no means involuntary,\nmade by a defendant who is aware of his \u2018rights,\u2019 may nonetheless\nbe excluded and a guilty defendant go free as a result\u201d).\nNonetheless, a \u201ccore virtue\u201d ofMirandahas been the\nclarity and precision of its guidance to \u201cpolice and courts.\u201dWithrowv.Williams,507 U. S. 680, 694 (1993) (internal\nquotation marks omitted); seeMoran,475 U. S., at 425\n(\u201c[O]ne of the principal advantages ofMirandais the ease\nand clarity of its application\u201d (internal quotation marks\nomitted)). This increased clarity \u201chas been thought to outweigh the\nburdens\u201d thatMirandaimposes.Fare, 442 U. S.,\nat 718. The Court has, however, repeatedly cautioned against\nupsetting the careful \u201cbalance\u201d thatMirandastruck,Moran,supra,at 424, and it has \u201crefused to\nsanction attempts to expand [the]Mirandaholding\u201d in ways\nthat would reduce its \u201cclarity.\u201d SeeQuarles, 467 U. S.,\nat 658 (citing cases). Given this practice, there should be a\n\u201cstrong presumption\u201d against the Court\u2019s new departure from the\nestablished custody test. SeeUnited Statesv.Patane,542\nU. S. 630, 640 (2004) (plurality opinion). In my judgment, that\npresumption cannot be overcome here.AThe Court\u2019s rationale for\nimporting age into the custody standard is that minors tend to lack\nadults\u2019 \u201ccapacity to exercise mature judgment\u201d and that failing to\naccount for that \u201creality\u201d will leave some minors unprotected underMirandain situations where they perceive themselves to be\nconfined. Seeante, at 10, 8. I do not dispute that many\nsuspects who are under 18 will be more susceptible to police\npressure than the average adult. As the Court notes, our\npre-Mirandacases were particularly attuned to this\n\u201creality\u201d in applying the constitutional requirement of\nvoluntariness in fact.Ante,at 9 (relying onHaley,332 U. S., at 599 (plurality opinion), andGallegos, 370 U. S., at 54). It is no less a \u201creality,\u201d\nhowever, that many personsoverthe age of 18 are also\nmore susceptible to police pressure than the hypothetical\nreasonable person. SeePayne,356 U. S., at 567 (fact that\ndefendant was a \u201cmentally dull 19-year-old youth\u201d relevant in\nvoluntariness inquiry). Yet theMirandacustody standard\nhas never accounted for the personal characteristics of these or\nany other individual defendants.Indeed, it has always been the\ncase underMirandathat the unusually meek or compliant\nare subject to the same fixed rules, including the same custody\nrequirement, as those who are unusually resistant to police\npressure.Berkemer, 468 U. S., at 442, and n.\u00a035\n(\u201c[O]nly relevant inquiry is how a reasonable man in the suspect\u2019s\nposition would have understood his situation\u201d).Miranda\u2019s\nrigid standards are both overinclusive and underinclusive. They are\noverinclusive to the extent that they provide a windfall to the\nmost hardened and savvy of suspects, who often have no need forMiranda\u2019s protections. CompareMiranda,supra, at 471\u2013472 (\u201c[N]o amount of circumstantial evidence\nthat the person may have been aware of\u00a0\u201d his rights can\novercomeMiranda\u2019s requirements), withOrozcov.Texas,394\nU. S. 324, 329 (1969) (White, J., dissenting) (\u201cWhere the\ndefendant himself [w]as a lawyer, policeman, professional criminal,\nor otherwise has become aware of what his right to silence is, it\nis sheer fancy to assert that his answer to every question asked\nhim is compelled unless he is advised of those rights with which he\nis already intimately familiar\u201d). AndMiranda\u2019s\nrequirements are underinclusive to the extent that they fail to\naccount for \u201cfrailties,\u201d \u201cidiosyncrasies,\u201d and other individualized\nconsiderations that might cause a person to bend more easily during\na confrontation with the police. SeeAlvarado, 541 U. S.,\nat 662 (internal quotation marks omitted). Members of this Court\nhave seen this rigidity as a major weakness inMiranda\u2019s\n\u201ccode of rules for confessions.\u201d See 384 U. S., at 504 (Harlan, J.,\ndissenting);Fare,439 U. S., at 1314 (Rehnquist, J., in\nchambers) (\u201c[T]he rigidity of [Miranda\u2019s] prophylactic\nrules was a principal weakness in the view of dissenters and\ncritics outside the Court\u201d). But if it is, then the weakness is an\ninescapable consequence of theMirandaCourt\u2019s decision to\nsupplement the more holistic voluntariness requirement with a\none-size-fits-all prophylactic rule.That is undoubtedly why this Court\u2019sMirandacases have never before mentioned \u201cthe suspect\u2019s\nage\u201d or any other individualized consideration in applying the\ncustody standard. SeeAlvarado,supra,at 666.\nAnd unless theMirandacustody rule is now to be radically\ntransformed into one that takes into account the wide range of\nindividual characteristics that are relevant in determining whether\na confession is voluntary, the Court must shoulder the burden of\nexplaining why age is different from these other personal\ncharacteristics.Why, for example, is age different from\nintelligence? Suppose that an officer, upon going to a school to\nquestion a student, is told by the principal that the student has\nan I.\u00a0Q. of 75 and is in a special-education class. Cf.In\nre J.\u00a0D.\u00a0B., 363 N.\u00a0C. 664, 666, 686 S.\u00a0E.\n2d 135, 136\u2013137 (2009). Are those facts more or less important than\nthe student\u2019s age in determining whether he or she \u201cfelt \u2026 at\nliberty to terminate the interrogation and leave\u201d? SeeThompsonv.Keohane,516 U. S. 99, 112 (1995).\nAn I.\u00a0Q. score, like age, is more than just a number.Ante, at 8 (\u201c[A]ge is far \u2018more than a chronological\nfact\u2019\u00a0\u201d). And an individual\u2019s intelligence can also yield\n\u201cconclusions\u201d similar to those \u201cwe have drawn ourselves\u201d in cases\nfar afield ofMiranda.Ante,at 12. Compareibid.(relying onEddingsv.Oklahoma,455 U. S. 104(1982), andRoperv.Simmons,543 U. S. 551(2005)), withSmithv.Texas,543 U. S. 37, 44\u201345\n(2004)(per curiam).How about the suspect\u2019s cultural background?\nSuppose the police learn (or should have learned, seeante, at 11) that a suspect they wish to question is a\nrecent immigrant from a country in which dire consequences often\nbefall any person who dares to attempt to cut short any meeting\nwith the police.[Footnote 9] Is\nthis really less relevant than the fact that a suspect is a month\nor so away from his 18th birthday?The defendant\u2019s education is another personal\ncharacteristic that may generate \u201cconclusions about behavior and\nperception.\u201dAnte, at 9 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Under today\u2019s decision, why should police officers and\ncourts \u201cblind themselves,\u201dante, at 1, to the fact that a\nsuspect has \u201conly a fifth-grade education\u201d? SeeClewis,\n386 U. S., at 712 (voluntariness case). Alternatively, what if the\npolice know or should know that the suspect is \u201ca college-educated\nman with law school training\u201d? SeeCrookerv.California,357 U. S. 433, 440\n(1958), overruled byMiranda,supra,at 479, and\nn. 48. How are these individual considerations meaningfully\ndifferent from age in their \u201crelationship to a reasonable person\u2019s\nunderstanding of his freedom of action\u201d?Ante, at 11. The\nCourt proclaims that \u201c[a] child\u2019s age . . . is different,\u201dante, at 12, but the basis for thisipse dixitis\ndubious.I have little doubt that today\u2019s decision will\nsoon be cited by defendants\u2014and perhaps by prosecutors as well\u2014for\nthe proposition that all manner of other individual characteristics\nshould be treated like age and taken into account in theMirandacustody calculus. Indeed, there are already lower\ncourt decisions that take this approach. SeeUnited Statesv.Beraun-Panez, 812 F.\u00a02d 578, 581, modified 830\nF.\u00a02d 127 (CA9 1987) (\u201creasonable person who was an alien\u201d);In re Jorge D., 202 Ariz. 277, 280, 43 P.\u00a03d 605, 608\n(App. 2002) (age, maturity, and experience);Statev.Doe,130 Idaho 811, 818, 948 P.\u00a02d 166, 173 (1997)\n(same);In re JoshuaDavid C.,116 Md. App. 580,\n594, 698 A.\u00a02d 1155, 1162 (1997) (\u201ceducation, age, and\nintelligence\u201d).In time, the Court will have to confront these\nissues, and it will be faced with a difficult choice. It may choose\nto distinguish today\u2019s decision and adhere to the arbitrary\nproclamation that \u201cage . . . is different.\u201dAnte, at 12.\nOr it may choose to extend today\u2019s holding and, in doing so,\nfurther undermine the very rationale for theMirandaregime.BIf the Court chooses the latter\ncourse, then a core virtue ofMiranda\u2014the \u201cease and\nclarity of its application\u201d\u2014will be lost.Moran, 475 U.\nS., at 425; seeFare, 442 U. S., at 718 (noting that the\nclarity ofMiranda\u2019s requirements \u201chas been thought to\noutweigh the burdens that the decision . . . imposes\u201d). However,\neven today\u2019s more limited departure fromMiranda\u2019s\none-size-fits-all reasonable-person test will produce the very\nconsequences that prompted theMirandaCourt to abandon\nexclusive reliance on the voluntariness test in the first place:\nThe Court\u2019s test will be hard for the police to follow, and it will\nbe hard for judges to apply. SeeDickersonv.United\nStates,530 U. S. 428, 444 (2000).The Court holds that age must be\ntaken into account when it \u201cwas known to the officer at the time of\nthe interview,\u201d or when it \u201cwould have been objectively apparent\u201d\nto a reasonable officer.Ante, at 11. The first half of\nthis test overturns the rule that the \u201cinitial determination of\ncustody\u201d does not depend on the \u201csubjective views harbored by . . .\ninterrogating officers.\u201dStansbury,511 U. S., at 323. The\nsecond half will generate time-consuming satellite litigation over\na reasonable officer\u2019s perceptions. When, as here, the\ninterrogation takes place in school, the inquiry may be relatively\nsimple. But not all police questioning of minors takes place in\nschools. In many cases, courts will presumably have to make\nfindings as to whether a particular suspect had a sufficiently\nyouthful look to alert a reasonable officer to the possibility that\nthe suspect was under 18, or whether a reasonable officer would\nhave recognized that a suspect\u2019s I.\u00a0D. was a fake. The inquiry\nwill be both \u201ctime-consuming and disruptive\u201d for the police and the\ncourts. SeeBerkemer, 468 U. S., at 432 (refusing to\nmodify the custody test based on similar considerations). It will\nalso be made all the more complicated by the fact that a suspect\u2019s\ndress and manner will often be different when the issue is\nlitigated in court than it was at the time of the\ninterrogation.Even after courts clear this initial hurdle,\nfurther problems will likely emerge as judges attempt to put\nthemselves in the shoes of the average 16-year-old, or 15-year-old,\nor 13-year-old, as the case may be. Consider, for example, a\n60-year-old judge attempting to make a custody determination\nthrough the eyes of a hypothetical, average 15-year-old. Forty-five\nyears of personal experience and societal change separate this\njudge from the days when he or she was 15 years old. And this judge\nmay or may not have been an average 15-year-old. The Court\u2019s answer\nto these difficulties is to state that \u201cno imaginative powers,\nknowledge of developmental psychology, [or] training in cognitive\nscience\u201d will be necessary.Ante, at 17. Judges \u201csimply\nneed the common sense,\u201d the Court assures, \u201cto know that a\n7-year-old is not a 13-year-old and neither is an adult.\u201dAnte,at 17. It is obvious, however, that application of\nthe Court\u2019s new rule demands much more than this.Take a fairly typical case in which today\u2019s\nholding may make a difference. A 16-year-old moves to suppress\nincriminating statements made prior to the administration ofMirandawarnings. The circumstances are such that, if the\ndefendant were at least 18, the court would not find that he or she\nwas in custody, but the defendant argues that a reasonable\n16-year-old would view the situation differently. The judge will\nnot have the luxury of merely saying: \u201cIt is common sense that a\n16-year-old is not an 18-year-old. Motion granted.\u201d Rather, the\njudge will be required to determine whether the differences between\na typical 16-year-old and a typical 18-year-old with respect to\nsusceptibility to the pressures of interrogation are sufficient to\nchange the outcome of the custody determination. Today\u2019s opinion\ncontains not a word of actual guidance as to how judges are\nsupposed to go about making that determination.CPetitioner and the Court attempt\nto show that this task is not unmanageable by pointing out that age\nis taken into account in other legal contexts. In particular, the\nCourt relies on the fact that the age of a defendant is a relevant\nfactor under the reasonable-person standard applicable in\nnegligence suits.Ante, at 11 (citing Restatement (Third)\nof Torts \u00a710, Commentb, p.\u00a0117 (2005)). But\nnegligence is generally a question for the jury, the members of\nwhich can draw on their varied experiences with persons of\ndifferent ages. It also involves apost hocdetermination,\nin the reflective atmosphere of a deliberation room, about whether\nthe defendant conformed to a standard of care. TheMirandacustody determination, by contrast, must be made in the first\ninstance by police officers in the course of an investigation that\nmay require quick decisionmaking. SeeQuarles, 467 U. S.,\nat 658 (noting \u201cthe importance\u201d underMirandaof providing\n\u201ca workable rule \u2018to guide police officers, who have only limited\ntime and expertise to reflect on and balance the social and\nindividual interests involved in the specific circumstances they\nconfront\u2019\u00a0\u201d);Alvarado, 541 U. S., at 668, 669\n(\u201c[T]he custody inquiry states an objective rule designed to give\nclear guidance to the police\u201d).Equally inapposite are the Eighth\nAmendment cases the Court cites in support of its new rule.Ante, at 9, 11, 12 (citingEddings,455 U. S. 104,Roper,543 U. S. 551, andGrahamv.Florida, 560 U. S. ___ (2010)). Those decisions involve\nthe \u201cjudicial exercise of independent judgment\u201d about the\nconstitutionality of certain punishments.E.g.,id., at ___ (slip op., at 16). Like the negligence\nstandard, they do not require on-the-spot judgments by the\npolice.Nor do state laws affording extra protection\nfor juveniles during custodial interrogation provide any support\nfor petitioner\u2019s arguments. See Brief for Petitioner 16\u201317. States\nare free to enact additional restrictions on the police over and\nabove those demanded by the Constitution orMiranda. In\naddition, these state statutes generally create clear, workable\nrules to guide police conduct. See Brief for Petitioner 16\u201317\n(citing statutes that require or permit parents to be present\nduring custodial interrogation of a minor, that require minors to\nbe advised of a statutory right to communicate with a parent or\nguardian, and that require parental consent to custodial\ninterrogation). Today\u2019s decision, by contrast, injects a new,\ncomplicating factor into what had been a clear, easily applied\nprophylactic rule. SeeAlvarado,supra,at\n668\u2013669.[Footnote 10]IIIThe Court\u2019s decision greatly\ndiminishes the clarity and administrability that have long been\nrecognized as \u201cprincipal advantages\u201d ofMiranda\u2019s\nprophylactic requirements. See,e.g.,Moran,475\nU. S., at 425. But what is worse, the Court takes this step\nunnecessarily, as there are other, less disruptive tools available\nto ensure that minors are not coerced into confessing.As an initial matter, the\ndifficulties that the Court\u2019s standard introduces will likely yield\nlittle added protection for most juvenile defendants. Most\njuveniles who are subjected to police interrogation are teenagers\nnearing the age of majority.[Footnote 11] These defendants\u2019 reactions to police\npressure are unlikely to be much different from the reaction of a\ntypical 18-year-old in similar circumstances. A one-size-fits-allMirandacustody rule thus provides a roughly reasonable\nfit for these defendants.In addition, many of the concerns that\npetitioner raises regarding the application of theMirandacustody rule to minors can be accommodated by considering the\nunique circumstances present when minors are questioned in school.\nSee Brief for Petitioner 10\u201311 (reciting at length the factors\npetitioner believes to be relevant to the custody determination\nhere, including the fact that petitioner was removed from class by\na police officer, that the interview took place in a school\nconference room, and that a uniformed officer and a vice principal\nwere present). TheMirandacustody rule has always taken\ninto account the setting in which questioning occurs, restrictions\non a suspect\u2019s freedom of movement, and the presence of police\nofficers or other authority figures. SeeAlvarado,supra,at 665;Marylandv.Shatzer, 559\nU. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 14). It can do so here as\nwell.[Footnote 12]Finally, in cases like the one now before us,\nwhere the suspect is much younger than the typical juvenile\ndefendant, courts should be instructed to take particular care to\nensure that incriminating statements were not obtained\ninvoluntarily. The voluntariness inquiry is flexible and\naccommodating by nature, seeSchneckloth,412 U. S., at\n224, and the Court\u2019s precedents already make clear that \u201cspecial\ncare\u201d must be exercised in applying the voluntariness test where\nthe confession of a \u201cmere child\u201d is at issue.Haley,332\nU. S., at 599 (plurality opinion). IfMiranda\u2019s rigid,\none-size-fits-all standards fail to account for the unique needs of\njuveniles, the response should be to rigorously apply the\nconstitutional rule against coercion to ensure that the rights of\nminors are protected. There is no need to runMirandaoff\nthe rails.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*The Court rests its\ndecision to inject personal characteristics into theMirandacustody inquiry on the principle that judges\napplyingMirandacannot \u201cblind themselves to \u2026 commonsense\nreality.\u201dAnte, at 1, 8, 10\u201311, 14. But the Court\u2019s shift\nis fundamentally at odds with the clear prophylactic rules thatMirandahas long enforced.Mirandafrequently\nrequires judges to blind themselves to the reality that many\nun-Mirandized custodial confessions are \u201cby no means involuntary\u201d\nor coerced.Dickerson,530 U. S., at 444. It also requires\npolice to provide a rote recitation ofMirandawarnings\nthat many suspects already know and could likely recite from\nmemory.[Footnote 13] Under\ntoday\u2019s new, \u201creality\u201d-based approach to the doctrine, perhaps\nthese and other principles of ourMirandajurisprudence\nwill, like the custody standard, now be ripe for modification.\nThen, bit by bit,Mirandawill lose the clarity and ease\nof application that has long been viewed as one of its chief\njustifications.I respectfully dissent.Footnote 1SeeMirandav.Arizona,384 U. S. 436(1966).Footnote 2Marylandv.Shatzer,559 U.\nS. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 13\u201316).Footnote 3Berkemerv.McCarty,468 U. S. 420, 437\u2013438 (1984).Footnote 4Oregonv.Mathiason,429 U. S. 492, 495 (1977)(per\ncuriam).Footnote 5New Yorkv.Quarles,467 U. S. 649, 655 (1984).Footnote 6Californiav.Beheler,463 U. S. 1121, 1122\u20131123 (1983)(per curiam).Footnote 7SeeTerryv.Ohio,392 U. S. 1(1968).Footnote 8The Court claims that \u201c[n]ot once\u201d have any\nof our cases \u201cexcluded from the custody analysis a circumstance\nthat we determined was relevant and objective, simply to make the\nfault line between custodial and noncustodial \u2018brighter.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAnte, at 17. Surely this is incorrect. The very act of\nadopting a reasonable-person test necessarily excludes all sorts of\n\u201crelevant and objective\u201d circumstances\u2014for example, all the\nobjective circumstances of a suspect\u2019s life history\u2014that might\notherwise bear on a custody determination.Footnote 9Cf.United Statesv.Chalan, 812 F.\u00a02d 1302, 1307 (CA10 1987) (rejecting\nclaim that Native American suspect was \u201cin custody\u201d forMirandapurposes because, by custom, obedience to tribal\nauthorities was \u201cexpected of all tribal members\u201d).Footnote 10The Court also relies on North Carolina\u2019s\nconcession at oral argument that a court could take into account a\nsuspect\u2019s blindness as a factor relevant to theMirandacustody determination.Ante, at 15, and n.\u00a09. This is\na far-fetched hypothetical, and neither the parties nor theiramicicite any case in which such a problem has actually\narisen. Presumably such a case would involve a situation in which a\nblind defendant was given \u201ca typed document advising him that he\n[was] free to leave.\u201d See Brief for Juvenile Law Center asAmicus Curiae23. In such a case, furnishing this advice\nin a form calculated to be unintelligible to the suspect would be\ntantamount to failing to provide the advice at all. And advice by\nthe police that a suspect is or is not free to leave at will has\nalways been regarded as a circumstance regarding the conditions of\nthe interrogation that must be taken into account in making theMirandacustody determination.Footnote 11See Dept of Justice, Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation, 2008 Crime in the United States (Sept. 2009), online\nat http://www2.fbi.gov/ ucr/cius2008/data/table_38.html (all\nInternet materials as visited June 8, 2011, and available in Clerk\nof Court\u2019s case file) (indicating that less than 30% of juvenile\narrests in the United States are of suspects who are under 15).Footnote 12The Court thinks it would be \u201cabsur[d]\u201d to\nconsider the school setting without accounting for age,ante, at 12, but the real absurdity is for the Court to\nrequire police officers to get inside the head of a reasonable\nminor while making the quick, on-the-spot determinations thatMirandademands.Footnote 13Surveys have shown that \u201c[l]arge majorities\u201d\nof the public are aware that \u201cindividuals arrested for a crime\u201d\nhave a right to \u201cremai[n] silent (81%),\u201d a right to \u201ca lawyer\n(95%),\u201d and a right to have a lawyer \u201cappointed\u201d if the arrestee\n\u201ccannot afford one (88%).\u201d See Belden, Russonello & Stewart,\nDeveloping a National Message for Indigent Defense: Analysis of\nNational Survey 4 (Oct. 2001), online at http://www.nlada.org/\nDMS/Documents/1211996548.53/Polling%20results%20report.pdf.",
