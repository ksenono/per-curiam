    "text": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES_________________No. 12\u201362_________________MARVIN PEUGH, PETITIONERv.UNITED\nSTATESon writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the seventh circuit[June 10, 2013]Justice Thomas, with whom the Chief Justice,\nJus-tice Scalia, and Justice Alito join as to Parts I and II\u2013C,\ndissenting.The Constitution prohibits Congress from passingex post factolaws. Art. I, \u00a79, cl.\u00a03. The retroactive\napplication of the 2009 Guidelines did not alter the punishment\naffixed to petitioner\u2019s crime and does not violate this\npro-scription. I would affirm the Seventh Circuit\u2019s decision\ndenying petitioner\u2019sex post factoclaim. Therefore, I\nrespectfully dissent.IIt is well established that anex post\nfactolaw includes \u201c[e]very law that changes the punishment,\nand inflicts a greater punishment, than the law annexed to the\ncrime, when committed.\u201dCalderv.Bull, 3 Dall. 386,\n390 (1798) (opinion of Chase, J.). Under our precedents, the\nrelevant inquiry for determining whether a law \u201cinflicts a greater\npunishment,\u201d is whether the \u201cretroactive application of the change\nin [the] law created \u2018a sufficient risk of increasing the measure\nof punishment attached to the covered crimes.\u2019\u00a0\u201dGarnerv.Jones,529 U.S.\n244, 250 (2000) (quotingCalifornia Dept. of Correctionsv.Morales,514 U.S.\n499, 509 (1995)). The retroactive application of subsequently\namended Guidelines does not create a \u201csufficient risk\u201d of\nincreasing a defendant\u2019s punishment for two reasons. First, the\nGuidelines do not constrain the discretion of district courts and,\nthus, have no legal effect on a defendant\u2019s sentence. Second, to\nthe extent that the amended Guidelines create ariskthat a\ndefendant might receive a harsher punishment, that risk results\nfrom the Guidelines\u2019 persuasive force, not any legal effect. The\nGuidelines help district judges to impose sentences that comply\nwith \u00a73553(a). The risk of an increased sentence is, in essence,\nthe risk of a moreaccuratesentence\u2014i.e.,a sentence\nmore in line with the statutory scheme\u2019s penological goals.\nGuideline changes that help district courts achieve such\npre-existing statutory sentencing goals do not create a risk of an\nincreased sentence cognizable under theEx Post FactoClause. We have never held that government action violates theEx Post FactoClause when it merely influences the exercise\nof the sentencing judge\u2019s discretion.AThe Federal Sentencing Guidelines do not\nconstrain the discretion of district courts. As we have said\nrepeatedly, the Guidelines are \u201cadvisory.\u201dUnited Statesv.Booker,543 U.S.\n220, 245 (2005) (remedial opinion for the Court by Breyer, J.).\nFor this reason, district courts may not \u201cpresume\u201d that a\nwithin-Guidelines sentence is appropriate.Gallv.United\nStates,552 U.S.\n38, 50 (2007); see alsoNelsonv.United States,555 U.S.\n350, 352 (2009) (per curiam) (the Guidelines range is\n\u201cnot to bepresumedreasonable\u201d);Ritav.United\nStates,551 U.S.\n338, 351 (2007) (\u201c[T]he sentencing court does not enjoy the\nbenefit of a legal presumption that the Guidelines sentence should\napply\u201d). Rather, district courts must \u201cmake an individualized\nassessment\u201d of the appropriate sentence \u201cbased on the facts\npresented.\u201dGall,supra,at 50. Moreover, a district\ncourt may freely depart from the range recommended by the\nGuidelines based not only on \u201can individualized determination that\n[the Guidelines] yield an excessive sentence in a particular case,\u201d\nbut also based on \u201cpolicydis-agreement\u201d with the Guidelines\nthemselves.Spearsv.United States,555 U.S.\n261, 264 (2009) (per curiam); seePepperv.United States, 562 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at\n23) (\u201c[O]ur post-Bookerdecisions make clear that a district\ncourt may in appropriate cases impose a non-Guidelines sentence\nbased on a disagreement with the Commission\u2019s views\u201d).It is true that a district judge who \u201cdecides\nthat an outside-Guidelines sentence is warranted\u201d must \u201censure that\nthe justification is sufficiently compelling to support the degree\nof the variance\u201d and that \u201ca major departure should be supported by\na more significant justification than a minor one.\u201dGall,\n552 U.\u00a0S., at 50. This does not demonstrate that the\nGuidelines constrain the judge\u2019s dis-cretion, but rather comports\nwith the notion that an explanation is essential for \u201cmeaningful\nappellate review.\u201dIbid. And, when a district court departs\nfrom the recommended range, the court of appeals may not presume\nthat such a sentence is unreasonable.Id., at 47;id., at 41 (\u201c[C]ourts of appeals must review all\nsentences\u2014whether inside, just outside, or significantly outside\nthe Guidelines range\u2014under a deferential abuse-of-discretion\nstandard\u201d). While \u201c[t]he applicable guideline [may] nudg[e] [the\nsentencing judge] toward the sentencing range,\u201d \u201chis freedom to\nimpose a reasonable sentence outside the range is unfettered.\u201dUnitedStates v.Demaree,459 F.3d 791, 795 (CA7 2006).None of petitioner\u2019s arguments to the contrary\nis persuasive. Petitioner first contends that the Guidelines\nconstrain district courts\u2019 discretion because improperly\ncalculating the applicable guidelines is reversible error. Brief\nfor Petitioner 20\u201321, and n. 7; 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73742(f); Cf.Gall, 552 U.\u00a0S., at 51. This argument is a non\nsequitur. The Guidelines can only serve their advisory purpose if\ndistrict courts consider the \u201crange established\u201d by the Guidelines,\n\u00a73553(a)(4). For this reason, district courts must \u201cbegin all\nsentencing proceedings by correctly calculating the applicable\nGuidelines range.\u201dId., at 49. But the fact that courts must\ngive due consideration to the recommendation expressed in thecorrectGuidelines does not mean that the Guidelines\nconstrain the district court\u2019s discretion to impose an appropriate\nsentence; it simply means that district courts must consider the\ncorrect vari-ables before exercising their discretion.Petitioner next argues that the Guidelines limit\ndistrict court discretion because sentences falling outside the\nGuidelines are more likely to be reversed for substantive\nunreasonableness. Brief for Petitioner 25. I doubt, however, that\nreversal is a likely outcome when a district judge can justify his\nsentence based on agreement with either of two Guidelines\u2014the old\nor the new. If a dis- trict court calculated the sentencing range\nunder the new Guidelines but sentenced the defendant to a\nbelow-Guidelines sentence that fell within the range provided by\nthe old Guidelines, it would be difficult to label such a sentence\n\u201csubstantively unreasonable.\u201d To do so would cast doubt on every\nwithin-Guidelines sentence issued un-der the old Guidelines.\nSimilarly, it is hard to imagine that a court of appeals would\nreverse a sentence for substantive unreasonableness if it was above\nthe range of the Guidelines in effect at the time of the offense\nbut fell within the range of the most up-to-date Guidelines. This\ncase provides an apt example. After considering all of the\n\u00a73553(a)(2) factors, the District Court concluded that a sentence\nwithin the amended Guidelines range was \u201cthe most appropriate\nsentence in this case.\u201d App. 100. The same sentence would\nundoubtedly be upheld on appeal if the District Court, on remand,\nonce again determined that a sentence within the amended Guidelines\nwas appropriate in light of all the facts. The essential point is\nthat once new Guidelines have been promulgated, reasonableness\nreview does not meaningfully constrain the discretion of district\ncourts to sentence offenders within either of the two ranges.The majority argues that our opinion inMillerv.Flor-ida,482 U.S.\n423(1987), supports its conclusion that retroactive\napplication of advisory Guidelines violates theEx Post\nFactoClause. Seeante,at 9\u201310. ButMillerleads\nto the opposite conclusion. There, Florida superimposed narrowed\npresumptive sentencing ranges on the statutory sentencing ranges\nfor particular crimes. 482 U.\u00a0S., at 425\u2013426. If a judge\nimposed a sentence within that narrower presumptive range, he did\nnot need to give a written explanation of his reasons for selecting\nthat sentence, and the sentence was not subject to appellate\nreview.Ibid. If the judge imposed a sentence outside the\npresumptive range, however, he was required to provide\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018clear and convincing reasons,\u2019\u00a0\u201did.,at 426\n(quoting Fla. Rule Crim. Proc. 3.701(d)(11) (1983)), based \u201con\nfacts proved beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d that justified the\ndeparture, 482 U.\u00a0S., at 432. In concluding that retroactive\napplication of this scheme violated theEx Post FactoClause, we reasoned that the Florida guidelines did not \u201csimply\nprovide flexible \u2018guideposts\u2019 for use in the exercise of\ndiscretion: instead, they create[d] a high hurdle that must be\ncleared before discretion c[ould] be exercised.\u201dId., at\n435.The Court citesMillerfor the\nproposition \u201cthat applying amended sentencing guidelines that\nincrease a defendant\u2019s recommended sentence can violate theEx\nPost FactoClause, notwithstanding the fact that sentencing\ncourts possess discretion to deviate from the recommended\nsentencing range.\u201dAnte,at 10. But that claim is not\nsupported byMiller. The guidelines inMillerviolated theEx Post FactoClause preciselybecausethey constrained the sentencing judge\u2019s discretion.The Federal Guidelines, by contrast, do no such\nthing. Indeed, our post-Bookeropinions have made abundantly\nclear that the Guidelines do not create a \u201chigh hurdle\u201d\u2014 or any\nhurdle at all\u2014\u201cthat must be cleared before discretion can be\nexercised.\u201dMiller, 482 U.\u00a0S., at 435. Rather, the\nGuidelines are \u201cflexible \u2018guideposts\u2019\u00a0\u201d which inform the\ndistrict courts\u2019 discretion.Ibid. Accordingly, their\nretroactive application cannot constitute a violation of theEx\nPost FactoClause.BNotwithstanding the discretion district courts\nhave to impose appropriate sentences anywhere within the statutory\nrange, Guidelines do \u201cinfluenc[e] the sentences imposed by judges.\u201dAnte,at 12. But, the Guidelines do this by helping district\ncourts impose sentences that are consistent with \u00a73553(a). It is\ndifficult to see how an advi-sory Guideline, designed to lead\ncourts to impose sentences more in line with fixed statutory\nobjectives, could ever constitute anex\u00a0post factoviolation. But that is exactly what the Court concludes.District courts are charged with imposing\nsentences that are \u201c\u00a0\u2018sufficient, but not greater than\nnecessary\u2019 to comply with the sentencing purposes set forth in\u201d\n\u00a73553(a).Pepper, 562 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 13)\n(quoting \u00a73553(a)). The district court\u2019s task is to impose\nsentences that reflect the punitive goals of justice, deterrence,\nprotection of the public, and rehabilitation. 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a73553(a)(2). While easily stated, this goal is difficult to\nachieve. Enter the Sentencing Guidelines.The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 instructs the\nSentencing Commission to promulgate Guidelines that reflect the\n\u201csame basic \u00a73553(a) objectives\u201d that district courts must\nconsider.Rita,551 U.\u00a0S., at 348; see also 28\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7991(b)(1)(A). In crafting the Guidelines, the\nCommission began with \u201can empirical examination of 10,000\npresentence reports setting forth what judges had done in the\npast.\u201dRita,supra, at 349 (citing United States\nSentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual \u00a71A1.1, comment.,\nn.\u00a03 (Nov. 2006) (USSG)). The Commission then \u201cmodif[ied] and\nadjust[ed] past practice in the interests of greater rationality,\navoiding inconsistency, complying with congressional instructions,\nand the like.\u201dRita,supra,at 349. While an\nindividual judge has limited experience upon which to draw, the\nCommission \u201chas the capacity . . . to base its determinations on\nempirical data and national experience, guided by a professional\nstaff with appropriate expertise.\u201dKimbroughv.United\nStates,552 U.S.\n85, 109 (2007) (internal quotation marks omitted). And the\nCommission updates the Guidelines regularly as new information\nbecomes available. It consults with \u201cprosecutors, defenders, law\nenforcement groups, civil liberties associations, experts in\npenology, and others,\u201d to ensure that the Guidelines continue to\nfurther \u00a73553(a)\u2019s goals.Rita,supra, at 350; see\nalsoBooker, 543 U.\u00a0S., at 263 (noting that the\nCommission would \u201cmodify its Guidelines in light of what it learns,\nthereby encouraging what it finds to be better sentencing\npractices\u201d).In light of this extensive study, amendments to\nthe Guidelines should produce sentencing ranges that better comport\nwith the \u00a73553(a) factors. If the Commission has fulfilled its\nmission of recommending sentences that are generally consistent\nwith \u00a73553(a)(2), then sentencesshouldfall within the\nGuidelines range most of the time. This, in part, explains why\nwithin-Guidelines sentences are presumed, on appeal, to reflect a\n\u201cdiscretionary decision\u201d by the district court that \u201caccords with\nthe Commission\u2019s view.\u201dRita,supra,at 351.Again, this case furnishes a ready example.\nPrior to pe-titioner\u2019s sentencing, Congress directed the Commission\n\u201cto consider\u201d whether fraud guidelines were \u201c\u00a0\u2018sufficient to\ndeter and punish\u2019\u00a0\u201d particular offenses, in light of increases\nto statutory maximum penalties for certain fraud crimes other than\nbank fraud. USSG App. C, Amdt. 653 (Reason for Amendment)\n(effective Nov. 1, 2003) (quoting White-Collar Crime Penalty\nEnhancement Act of 2002, \u00a7905(b)(2), 116Stat. 805). This produced\namended Guidelines, which were based on the Commission\u2019s further\nassessment of \u201ceconomic crime issues over a number of years.\u201d USSG\nApp. C, Amdt. 617 (Reason for Amendment) (effective Nov. 1, 2001).\nWith an amended Guidelines sentencing range, the District Court\nconcluded that a within-Guidelines sentence was \u201cthe most\nappropriate sentence.\u201d App. 100. Neither the statutory sentencing\nrange nor \u00a73553(a) changed between the time of petitioner\u2019s offense\nand sentencing. Thus, it is quite incorrect to say that reliance on\ninformation reflected in the amended Guidelines violated theEx\nPost FactoClause.This is underscored by the fact that even the\nCourt\u2019s holding\u2014which requires district courts to calculate the\nGuidelines range in effect at the time of the offense\u2014will not\neliminate the \u201crisk\u201d of a higher sentence. The district judge\nremains free to consider the range produced by the amended\nGuidelines. SeeDemaree, 459 F.\u00a03d, at 795 (\u201cA judge is\ncertainly entitled to take advice from the Sentencing Commission\u201d).\nThus, the mere fact that new Guidelines have been promulgated\ncreatessomerisk of an increased sentence, even if district\ncourts are required to calculate the Guidelines in effect at the\ntime of the offense. Petitioner has presented no evidence\nindicating what portion of the risk of an increased sentence flows\nfrom the retroactiveapplicationof the amended Guidelines\nand what portion flows from their veryexistence. In the\nabsence of such evidence, even if I agreed that advisory Guidelines\ncould beex post factolaws, which I do not, I would not\nfind the \u201crisk\u201d of an increased sentence created by the retroactive\napplication of the Guidelines to be \u201csuf-ficient\u201d forex post\nfactopurposes.IIToday\u2019s opinion also demonstrates the\nunworkability of ourex post factojurisprudence. Under our\ncurrent precedent, whenever a change in the law creates a \u201crisk\u201d of\nan increased sentence, we must determine whether the risk is\n\u201csufficient,\u201d seeMorales, 514 U.\u00a0S., at 509, or\nsufficiently \u201c\u00a0\u2018significant,\u2019\u00a0\u201d seeante,at 19,\nto violate theEx Post FactoClause. Our analysis under that\ntest has devolved into little more than an exercise in judicial\nintuition. I would return to the original meaning of the Clause as\nstated in Justice Chase\u2019s classicCalderformulation, under\nwhich laws of this sort areex post factoonly when they\nretro-actively increase the punishment \u201cannexed to the crime.\u201d 3\nDall., at 390.AThis Court addressed theEx Post FactoClause a mere decade after the Constitution was ratified. InCalder, Justice Chase described four types ofex post\nfactolaws. 3 Dall.,at 390. As relevant, Justice\nChase\u2019s third category indicated that \u201c[e]very law that changes the\npunishment, and inflicts a greater punishment, than the law annexed\nto the crime, when committed\u201d violates theEx Post FactoClause.Ibid.Justice Chase\u2019s emphasis on increases in the\npunishment \u201cannexed to the crime\u201d was grounded in the English\ncommon law and accurately reflected the original understanding of\ntheEx Post FactoClause. See Part II\u2013B,infra.\nUnfortunately, the Court rapidly deviated from this formulation. InKringv.Missouri,107 U.S.\n221(1883), the Court declared that \u201cany law passed after the\ncommission of an offence which . . . \u2018in relation to that offence,\nor its consequences,alters the situation of a party to his\ndisadvantage,\u2019 is anex post factolaw.\u201dId., at\n235 (quoting Justice Washington\u2019s jury charge inUnited\nStatesv.Hall, 26 F. Cas. 84, 86 (No. 15,285) (CC Pa.\n1809) (emphasis added). It took nearly a century for the Court to\ndecide thatKring\u2019s \u201cdeparture fromCalder\u2019s\nexplanation of the original understanding of theEx Post\nFactoClause was .\u00a0.\u00a0. unjustified.\u201dCollinsv.Youngblood,497 U.S.\n37, 49 (1990) (overrulingKring).FollowingCollins\u2019 disavowal ofKring, the Court held that a law isex post factoif\nit \u201cproduces a sufficient risk of increasing the measure of\npunishment attached to the covered crimes.\u201dMorales,supra,at 509. WhileMoralesavoided the over-breadth\nofKring\u2019s \u201cdisadvantage the de-fendant\u201d test, it failed to\nreconnect ourex post factoju-risprudence to the original\nunderstanding of the term.[1]*\nThe \u201csufficient risk\u201d test also depends upon empirical analysis\nthat cannot yield determinative answers and which courts are ill\nequipped to handle. See,e.g.,Gar- ner,529\nU.\u00a0S., at 255 (\u201cWhen the rule does not by its own terms show a\nsignificant risk, the respondent must demonstrate, by evidence\ndrawn from the rule\u2019s practical implementation by the agency\ncharged with exercising discretion, that its retroactive\napplication will result in a longer period of incarceration than\nunder the earlier rule\u201d). More fundamentally, the \u201csufficient risk\u201d\ntest, like the \u201cdisadvantage the defendant\u201d test, wrongly focuses\non the particular sentence that the defendantmightreceive,\nrather than on the punishment \u201cannexed to the crime.\u201dThe practical difficulties with the test are\napparent even from our application inMorales, where we\nconsidered an amendment to California\u2019s parole procedures that\nallowed, under certain circumstances, the Board of Prison Terms to\ndecrease the frequency of parole suitability hearings. Under the\nsufficient risk test, we were compelled to speculate about the\npossible effects of the new law on various individuals\u2019 prison\nterms. Ultimately, we held that the amendment did not violate theEx Post FactoClause because the \u201cnarrow class of prisoners\ncovered by the amendment [could not] reasonably expect that their\nprospects for early release on parole would be enhanced by the\nopportunity of annual hearings.\u201dMorales,supra, at\n512. But nothing in the text or history of theEx Post FactoClause suggests that it should hinge on the expectations that\nprisoners and defendants have about how many days they will spend\nin prison.B\u201cAlthough the Latin phrase \u2018ex post\nfacto\u2019 literally encompasses any law passed \u2018after the\nfact,\u2019\u00a0\u201dCollins,497 U.\u00a0S., at 41, the Court has\nlong recognized that the phrase \u201cwas a term of art with an\nestablished meaning\u201d at the time of the founding.Ibid.Blackstone offers the first key to understanding this \u201cestablished\nmeaning.\u201d He explic-itly opposed laws that rendered innocent\nconduct crimi- nal after the fact. See 1 W. Blackstone,\nCommentaries *44 (hereinafter Blackstone). Such laws deprive\ncitizens of notice and fair warning and are, therefore, an affront\nto man\u2019s \u201creason and freewill.\u201dId., at *39; seeid.,\nat *46. Blackstone, thus, considered them illegitimate.Id.,\nat *44; see also The Federalist No. 44, p. 301 (J. Cooke ed. 1961)\n(J. Madison) (\u201c[E]x post facto laws .\u00a0.\u00a0. are contrary to\nthe first principles of the social compact, and to every principle\nof sound legislation\u201d). For this reason,ex post factolaws\nhave rightly been described as \u201cformidable instruments of tyranny,\u201did., No. 84, at 577 (A. Hamilton), and their prohibition a\n\u201cbulwark in favour of the personal security of the subject,\u201dCalder,supra, at 390 (opinion of Chase, J.).Although Blackstone confined his discussion ofex post factolaws to those laws retroactively declaring\ninnocent acts to be criminal, other authorities confirm that laws\nretroactively increasing the punishment were also understood to beex post factoat the time of the founding. See,e.g.,2 R. Wooddeson, A Systematical View of the Laws of England, as\ntreated in a Course of Vinerian Lectures 638 (1792) (discussing\n\u201cacts of parliament, which principally affectthe\npunishment, making therein some innovation, or creating some\nforfeiture or disability, not incurred in the ordinary course of\nlaw\u201d); 3 J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United\nStates \u00a7679, p. 486 (Abr. 1833) (The \u201cprohibition\u201d againstex\npost factolaws \u201creaches every law . .\u00a0. whereby the act,\nif a crime, is aggravated in enormity, or punishment\u201d). Justice\nChase\u2019s formulation reflects this understanding.Calder, 3\nDall., at 390 (\u201cEvery law that changes the punishment, and inflicts\na greater punishment, than the law annexed to the crime, when\ncommitted\u201d isex post facto). Under this view, courts must\ncompare the punishment affixed to the crime at the time of the\noffense with the punishment affixed at the time of sentencing. If\nthe latter is harsher than the former, the court must apply the\npunishment in effect at the time of the offense.At common law, it was quite easy to identify\nwhen a law retroactively increased the punishment, because the\ncriminal law generally \u201cprescribed a particular sentence for each\noffense.\u201d Langbein, The English Criminal Trial Jury on the Eve of\nthe French Revolution, in The Trial Jury in England, France,\nGermany 1700\u20131900, p. 36 (A. Schioppa ed. 1987). In a world of\ndeterminate sentencing, a retro-active increase in the punishment\naffixed to a crime rend-ers an act \u201cpunishable in a manner in which\nit was not punishable when it was committed,\u201dFletcherv.Peck, 6 Cranch 87, 138 (1810), which is sufficient for anex post factoviolation. The key point is that \u201ctheex\npost facto[C]lause looks to the standard of punishment\nprescribed by a statute, rather than to the sentence actually\nimposed.\u201dLindseyv.Washington,301 U.S.\n397, 401 (1937).Focusing on the punishment affixed by law,\nrather than on the specific sentence imposed, furthers the goals of\nnotice and fair warning recognized by Blackstone as the rationales\nfor the prohibition againstex post factolaws. SeeRoss\u2019Case, 19 Mass. 165, 170 (1824) (\u201cA party ought\nto know, at the time of committing the offence, the whole extent of\nthe punishment; for it may sometimes be a matter of calculation,\nwhether he will commit the offence, considering the severity of the\npunishment\u201d). Because increasing the punishment affixed to the\ncrime deprives people of the opportunity to plan their conduct in\nlight of the law, \u201c[t]he enhancement of a crime, or penalty, seems\nto come within the same mischief as the creation of a crime or\npenalty; and therefore they may be classed together.\u201dCalder,supra,at 397 (opinion of Paterson, J.).Retroactive laws that merely create ariskthat a defendant will receive a higher sentence,\nhowever, do not implicate traditionalex post factoconcerns. An individual contemplating the commission of a given\noffense knows he may be sentenced anywhere within the legally\nprescribed range. He mayhopeto receive a lenient sentence,\nand he may even have good reasons for expecting leniency. But he\ndoes not have any guarantees. SeeGarner, 529 U.\u00a0S., at\n258 (Scalia, J., concurring in part in judgment) (\u201cDiscretion to be\ncompassionate or harsh is inherent in the sentencing scheme, and\nbeing denied compassion is one of the risks that the offender\nknowingly assumes\u201d). The law provides the defendant with only one\nassurance: He will be sentenced within the range affixed to his\noffense by statute. Legal changes that alter thelikelihoodof a particular sentence within the legally prescribed range do not\ndeprive people of notice and fair warning, or implicate the\nconcerns about tyranny that animated the adoption of theEx Post\nFactoClause.CThe statutory range in effect at the time of\npetitioner\u2019s offense remained in effect at his sentencing. The\nGuidelines sentencing range is not the punishment affixed to the\noffense. See in Part I\u2013A,supra. Accordingly, sentencing\npetitioner under the amended Guidelines did not violate theEx\nPost FactoClause. Because the Court concludes otherwise, I\nrespectfully dissent.Notes1*\u00a0As the author ofMorales, failure to apply the original meaning was an error\nto which I succumbed.",
