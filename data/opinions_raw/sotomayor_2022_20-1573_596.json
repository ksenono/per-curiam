The Court\nfaithfully applies precedent to hold that California\u2019s anti-waiver\nrule for claims under the State\u2019s Labor Code Private Attorneys\nGeneral Act of 2004 (PAGA) is pre-empted only \u201cinsofar as it\nprecludes division of PAGA actions into individual and\nnon-individual claims through an agreement to arbitrate.\u201dAnte,at 20. In its analysis of the parties\u2019 contentions,\nthe Court also details several important limitations on the\npre-emptive effect of the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA). Seeante,at 11\u201317. As a whole, the Court\u2019s opinion makes clear\nthat California is not powerless to address its sovereign concern\nthat it cannot adequately enforce its Labor Code without assistance\nfrom private attorneys general.The Court concludes that the FAA poses no bar to\nthe adjudication of respondent Angie Moriana\u2019s \u201cnon-individual\u201d\nPAGA claims, but that PAGA itself \u201cprovides no mechanism to enable\na court to adjudicate non-individual PAGA claims once an individual\nclaim has been committed to a separate proceeding.\u201dAnte,at\n21. Thus, the Court reasons, based on available guidance from\nCalifornia courts, that Moriana lacks \u201cstatutory standing\u201d under\nPAGA to litigate her \u201cnon-individual\u201d claims separately in state\ncourt.Ibid.Of course, if this Court\u2019s understanding of\nstate law is wrong, California courts, in an appropriate case, will\nhave the last word. Alternatively, if this Court\u2019s understanding is\nright, the California Legislature is free to modify the scope of\nstatutory standing under PAGA within state and federal\nconstitutional limits. With this understanding, I join the Court\u2019s\nopinion.",
