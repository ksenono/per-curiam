SeeCooperv.Harris, 581 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2017) (concurring opinion)\n(slip op., at 1) (citingHolderv.Hall, 512\nU.\u00a0S. 874, 922\u2013923 (1994) (Thomas, J., concurring in\njudgment)). Thus, \u00a72 cannot provide a basis for invalidating any\ndistrict, and it cannot provide a justification for the racial\ngerrymander in House District 90. Because the Court correctly\napplies our precedents and reaches the same conclusion, I join its\nopinion in full.",
