As Justice Alito\u2019s opinion demonstrates,Smithfailed to respect this Court\u2019s precedents, was\nmistaken as a matter of the Constitution\u2019s original public meaning,\nand has proven unworkable in practice. A majority of our\ncolleagues, however, seek to sidestep the question. They agree that\nthe City of Philadelphia\u2019s treatment of Catholic Social Services\n(CSS) violates the Free Exercise Clause. But, they say, there\u2019s no\n\u201cneed\u201d or \u201creason\u201d to address the error ofSmithtoday.Ante,at 5 (majority opinion);ante, at 2 (Barrett,\nJ., concurring).On the surface it may seem a nice move, but dig\nan inch deep and problems emerge.Smithexempts \u201cneutral\u201d\nand \u201cgenerally applicable\u201d laws from First Amendment scrutiny. 494\nU.\u00a0S., at 878\u2013881. The City argues that its challenged rules\nqualify for that exemption because they require all foster-care\nagencies\u2014religious and non-religious alike\u2014to recruit and certify\nsame-sex couples interested in serving as foster parents. For its\npart, the majority assumes (without deciding) that Philadelphia\u2019s\nrule is indeed \u201cneutral\u201d toward religion.Ante,at 5. So to\navoidSmith\u2019s exemption and subject the City\u2019s policy to\nFirst Amendment scrutiny, the majority must carry the burden of\nshowing that the policy isn\u2019t \u201cgenerally applicable.\u201d*That path turns out to be a long and lonely\none. The district court held that the City\u2019s public accommodations\nlaw (its Fair Practices Ordinance or FPO)isboth generally\napplicable and applicable to CSS. At least initially, the majority\nchooses to bypass the district court\u2019s major premise\u2014that the FPO\nqualifies as \u201cgenerally applicable\u201d underSmith. It\u2019s a\ncurious choice given that the FPO applies only to certain defined\nentities that qualify as public accommodations while the \u201cgenerally\napplicable law\u201d inSmithwas \u201can across-the-board criminal\nprohibition\u201d enforceable against anyone. 494 U.\u00a0S., at 884.\nBut if the goal is to turn a big dispute of constitutional law into\na small one, the majority\u2019s choice to focus its attack on the\ndistrict court\u2019s minor premise\u2014that the FPO applies to CSS as a\nmatter of municipal law\u2014begins to make some sense. Still, it isn\u2019t\nexactly an obvious path. The Third Circuit did not address the\ndistrict court\u2019s interpretation of the FPO. And not one of the over\n80 briefs before us contests it. To get to where it wishes to go,\nthen, the majority must go it alone. So much for the adversarial\nprocess and being \u201ca court of review, not of first view.\u201dBrownbackv.King, 592 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___, n.\u00a04\n(2021) (slip op., at 5, n.\u00a04) (internal quotation marks\nomitted).Trailblazing through the Philadelphia city code\nturns out to be no walk in the park either. As the district court\nobserved, the City\u2019s FPO defines \u201cpublic accommodations\u201d\nexpansively to include \u201c[a]ny provider\u201d that \u201csolicits or accepts\npatronage\u201d of \u201cthe public or whose .\u00a0.\u00a0. services [or]\nfacilities\u201d are \u201cmade available to the public.\u201d App. to Pet. for\nCert. 77a (alteration omitted; emphasis deleted). And, the district\ncourt held, this definition covers CSS because (among other things)\nit \u201cpublicly solicits prospective foster parents\u201d and \u201cprovides\nprofessional \u2018services\u2019 to the public.\u201dId.,at 78a. All of\nwhich would seem to block the majority\u2019s way. So how does it get\naround that problem?It changes the conversation. The majority\nignores the FPO\u2019s expansive definition of \u201cpublic accommodations.\u201d\nIt ignores the reason the district court offered for why CSS falls\nwithin that definition. Instead, it asks us to look to adifferentpublic accommodations law\u2014a Commonwealth of\nPennsylvania public accommodations statute. Seeante,at\n10\u201311 (discussing Pa. Stat. Ann., Tit. 43, \u00a7954(l) (Purdon\nCum. Supp. 2009)). And, the majority promises, CSS fails to qualify\nas a public accommodation under the terms ofthatlaw. But\nwhy should we ignore the City\u2019s law and look to the Commonwealth\u2019s?\nNo one knows because the majority doesn\u2019t say.Even playing along with this statutory shell\ngame doesn\u2019t solve the problem. The majority highlights the fact\nthat the state law lists various examples of public\naccommodations\u2014including hotels, restaurants, and swimming pools.Ante,at 11. The majority then argues that foster agencies\nfail to qualify as public accommodations because, unlike these\nlisted entities, foster agencies \u201cinvolv[e] a customized and\nselective assessment.\u201dIbid.But where doesthatdistinction come from? Not the text of the state statute, not state\ncase law, and certainly not from the briefs. The majority just\ndeclares it\u2014a new rule of Pennsylvania common law handed down by\nthe United States Supreme Court.The majority\u2019s gloss on state law isn\u2019t just\nnovel, it\u2019s probably wrong. While the statute lists hotels,\nrestaurants, and swimming pools as examples of public\naccommodations, it also lists over 40 other kinds of\ninstitutions\u2014and the statute emphasizes that these examples are\nillustrative, not exhaustive. See \u00a7954(l). Among its\nillustrations, too, the statute offers public \u201ccolleges and\nuniversities\u201d as examples of public accommodations.Ibid.Often these institutionsdoengage in a \u201ccustomized and\nselective assessment\u201d of their clients (students) and employees\n(faculty). And iftheycan qualify as public accommodations\nunder the state statute, it isn\u2019t exactly clear why foster agencies\ncannot. What does the majority have to say about this problem?\nAgain, silence.If anything, the majority\u2019s next move only adds\nto the confusion. It denies cooking up any of these arguments on\nits own. It says it merely means to \u201cagree with CSS\u2019s position\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. that its \u2018foster services do not constitute a\n\u201cpublic accommodation\u201d under the City\u2019s Fair Practices\nOrdinance.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAnte,at 13 (quoting App. to Pet. for\nCert. 159a). But CSS\u2019s cited \u201cposition\u201d\u2014which comes from a letter\nit sent to the City before litigation even began\u2014includes nothing\nlike the majority\u2019s convoluted chain of reasoning involving a\nseparate state statute.Id., at 159a\u2013160a. Instead, CSS\u2019s\nletter contends that the organization\u2019s services do not qualify as\n\u201cpublic accommodations\u201d because they are \u201conly available to at-risk\nchildren who have been removed by the state and are in need of a\nloving home.\u201dIbid.The majority tells us with assurance\nthat it \u201cagree[s] with\u201d this position, adding that it would be\n\u201cincongru[ous]\u201d to \u201cdee[m] a private religious foster agency a\npublic accommodation.\u201dAnte,at 12.What to make of all this? Maybe this part of the\nmajority opinion should be read only as reaching for\nsomething\u2014anything\u2014to support its curious separate-statute move.\nBut maybe the majority means to reject the district court\u2019s major\npremise after all\u2014suggesting it would be incongruous for public\naccommodations laws to qualify as generally applicable underSmithbecause they do not apply to everyone. Or maybe the\nmajority means to invoke a canon of constitutional avoidance:\nBefore concluding that a public accommodations law is generally\napplicable underSmith, courts must ask themselves whether\nit would be \u201cincongru[ous]\u201d to apply that law to religious groups.\nMaybe all this ambiguity is deliberate, maybe not. The only thing\ncertain here is that the majority\u2019s attempt to cloak itself in\nCSS\u2019s argument introduces more questions than answers.*Still that\u2019s not the end of it. Even now, the\nmajority\u2019s circumnavigation ofSmithremains only half\ncomplete. The City argues that, in addition to the FPO,anothergenerally applicable nondiscrimination rule can be\nfound in \u00a715.1 of its contract with CSS. That provision\nindependently instructs that foster service providers \u201cshall not\ndiscriminate or permit discrimination against any individual on the\nbasis of .\u00a0.\u00a0. sexual orientation.\u201d Supp. App. to Brief\nfor City Respondents 31. This provision, the City contends, amounts\nto a second and separate rule of general applicability exempt from\nFirst Amendment scrutiny underSmith. Once more, the\nmajority must find some way around the problem. Its attempt to do\nso proceeds in three steps.First, the majority directs our attention to\nanother provision of the contract\u2014\u00a73.21. Seeante,at\n7\u20139.Entitled \u201cRejection of Referral,\u201d this provision\nprohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation, race,\nreligion, or other grounds \u201cunless an exception is granted\u201d in the\ngovernment\u2019s \u201csole discretion.\u201d Supp. App. to Brief for City\nRespondents 16\u201317. Clearly, the majority says,thatprovision doesn\u2019t state a generally applicable rule against\ndiscrimination because it expressly contemplates \u201cexceptions.\u201dAnte,at 8.But how does that help? As \u00a73.21\u2019s title\nindicates, the provision contemplates exceptions only when it comes\nto the referral stage of the foster process\u2014where the government\nseeks to place a particular child with an available foster family.\nSee A. Scalia & B. Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of\nLegal Texts 221 (2012) (\u201cThe title and headings are permissible\nindicators of meaning\u201d (boldface deleted)). So, for example, the\nCity has taken race into account when placing a child who \u201cused\nracial slurs\u201d to avoid placing him with parents \u201cof that race.\u201d Tr.\nof Oral Arg. 61. Meanwhile, our case has nothing to do with the\nreferral\u2014or placement\u2014stage of the foster process. This case\nconcerns the recruitment and certification stages\u2014where foster\nagencies like CSS screen and enroll adults who wish to serve as\nfoster parents. And inthosestages of the foster process,\n\u00a715.1 seems to prohibit discrimination absolutely.That difficulty leads the majority to its second\nstep. It asks us to ignore \u00a73.21\u2019s title and its limited\napplication to the referral stage. Seeante,at 9. Instead,\nthe majority suggests, we should reconceive \u00a73.21 as authorizing\nexceptions to the City\u2019s nondiscrimination rule ateverystage of the foster process. Once we do that, the majority\nstresses, \u00a73.21\u2019s reservation of discretion is irreconcilable with\n\u00a715.1\u2019s blanket prohibition against discrimination. Seeante,at 9.This sets up the majority\u2019s final move\u2014where the\nreal magic happens. Having conjured a conflict within the contract,\nthe majority devises its own solution. It points to some state\ncourt decisions that, it says, set forth the \u201crule\u201d that\nPennsylvania courts shouldn\u2019t interpret one provision in a contract\n\u201cto annul\u201d another part.Ibid.To avoid nullifying \u00a73.21\u2019s\nreservation of discretion, the majority insists, it has no choice\nbut to rewrite \u00a715.1. All so that\u2014voila\u2014\u00a715.1 now containsits ownparallel reservation of discretion. Seeante,at 9.As rewritten, the contract contains no generally\napplicable rule against discrimination anywhere in the foster\nprocess.From start to finish, it is a dizzying series of\nmaneuvers. The majority changes the terms of the parties\u2019 contract,\nadopting an uncharitably broad reading (really revision) of \u00a73.21.\nIt asks us to ignore the usual rule that a more specific\ncontractual provision can comfortably coexist with a more general\none. And it proceeds to resolve a conflict it created by rewriting\n\u00a715.1. Once more, too, no party,amicus, or lower court\nargued for any of this.To be sure, the majority again claims\notherwise\u2014representing that it merely adopts the arguments of CSS\nand the United States. Seeante,at 10. But here, too, the\nmajority\u2019s representation raises rather than resolves questions.\nInstead of pursuing anything like the majority\u2019s contract\narguments, CSS and the United States suggest that \u00a73.21\n\u201calonetriggers strict scrutiny,\u201d Reply Brief 5 (emphasis\nadded), because that provision authorizes the City \u201cto grant formal\nexemptionsfrom its policy\u201d of nondiscrimination, Brief for\nUnited States asAmicus Curiae26 (emphasis added). On this\ntheory, it\u2019s irrelevant whether \u00a73.21 or \u00a715.1 reserve discretion\nto grant exemptions at all stages of the process or at only one\nstage. Instead, the City\u2019s power to grant exemptions from its\nnondiscrimination policyanywhere\u201cundercuts its asserted\ninterests\u201d and thus \u201ctrigger[s] strict scrutiny\u201d for applying the\npolicyeverywhere.Id.,at 21. Exceptions for one\nmeans strict scrutiny for all. See,e.g., Tandonv.Newsom,ante, at 1\u20132 (per\u00a0curiam). All of\nwhich leaves us to wonder: Is the majority just stretching to claim\nsome cover for its novel arguments? Or does it actually mean to\nadopt the theory it professes to adopt?*Given all the maneuvering, it\u2019s hard not to\nwonder if the majority is so anxious to say nothing aboutSmith\u2019s fate that it is willing to say pretty much anything\nabout municipal law and the parties\u2019 briefs. One way or another,\nthe majority seems determined to declare there is no \u201cneed\u201d or\n\u201creason\u201d to revisitSmithtoday. Ante,at 5 (majority\nopinion);ante,at 2 (Barrett, J., concurring).But tell that to CSS. Its litigation has already\nlasted years\u2014and today\u2019s (ir)resolution promises more of the same.\nHad we followed the path Justice Alito outlines\u2014holding that the\nCity\u2019s rules cannot avoid strict scrutiny even if they qualify as\nneutral and generally applicable\u2014this case would end today.\nInstead, the majority\u2019s course guarantees that this litigation is\nonly getting started. As the final arbiter of state law, the\nPennsylvania Supreme Court can effectively overrule the majority\u2019s\nreading of the Commonwealth\u2019s public accommodations law. The City\ncan revise its FPO to make even plainer still that its law does\nencompass foster services. Or with a flick of a pen, municipal\nlawyers may rewrite the City\u2019s contract to close the \u00a73.21\nloophole.Once any of that happens, CSS will find itself\nback where it started. The City has made clear that it will never\ntolerate CSS carrying out its foster-care mission in accordance\nwith its sincerely held religious beliefs. To the City, it makes no\ndifference that CSS has not denied service to a single same-sex\ncouple; that dozens of other foster agencies stand willing to serve\nsame-sex couples; or that CSS is committed to help any inquiring\nsame-sex couples find those other agencies. The City has expressed\nits determination to put CSS to a choice: Give up your sincerely\nheld religious beliefs or give up serving foster children and\nfamilies. If CSS is unwilling to provide foster-care services to\nsame-sex couples, the City prefers that CSS provide no foster-care\nservices at all. This litigation thus promises to slog on for years\nto come, consuming time and resources in court that could be better\nspent serving children. And throughout it all, the opacity of the\nmajority\u2019s professed endorsement of CSS\u2019s arguments ensures the\nparties will be forced to devote resources to the unenviable task\nof debating what iteven means.Nor will CSS bear the costs of the Court\u2019s\nindecision alone. Individuals and groups across the country will\npay the price\u2014in dollars, in time, and in continued uncertainty\nabout their religious liberties. Consider Jack Phillips, the baker\nwhose religious beliefs prevented him from creating custom cakes to\ncelebrate same-sex weddings. SeeMasterpiece Cakeshop, Ltd.v.Colorado Civil Rights Comm\u2019n, 584 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2018).\nAfter being forced to litigate all the way to the Supreme Court, we\nruled for him on narrow grounds similar to those the majority\ninvokes today. Because certain government officials responsible for\ndeciding Mr. Phillips\u2019s compliance with a local public\naccommodations law uttered statements exhibiting hostility to his\nreligion, the Court held, those officials failed to act \u201cneutrally\u201d\nunderSmith. See 584 U.\u00a0S.,at ___\u2013___ (slip\nop., at 16\u201318). But withSmithstill on the books, all that\nvictory assured Mr. Phillips was a new round of litigation\u2014with\nofficials now presumably more careful about admitting their\nmotives. See Associated Press, Lakewood Baker Jack Phillips Sued\nfor Refusing Gender Transition Cake (Mar. 22, 2021),\nhttps\u00a0:\u00a0/\u00a0/\u00a0denver\u00a0.\u00a0cbslocal.\u00a0com\u00a0/\u00a02021\u00a0/\u00a003\u00a0/\u00a022\u00a0/\u00a0jack\u00a0-\u00a0phillips\u00a0-\nmasterpiece-cakeshop-lakewood-transgender/. A nine-year odyssey\nthus barrels on. No doubt, too, those who cannot afford such\nendless litigation underSmith\u2019s regime have been and will\ncontinue to be forced to forfeit religious freedom that the\nConstitution protects.The costs of today\u2019s indecision fall on lower\ncourts too. As recent cases involving COVID\u201319 regulations\nhighlight, judges across the country continue to struggle to\nunderstand and applySmith\u2019s test even thirty years after it\nwas announced. In the last nine months alone, this Court has had to\nintervene at least half a dozen times to clarify howSmithworks. See,e.g.,Tandon,ante,at p.\u00a01;Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklynv.Cuomo, 592\nU.\u00a0S. ___ (2020) (per\u00a0curiam);High Plains\nHarvest Churchv.Polis, 592 U.\u00a0S ___ (2020). To be\nsure, this Court began to resolve at least some of the confusion\nsurroundingSmith\u2019s application inTandon. ButTandontreated the symptoms, not the underlying ailment. We\nowe it to the parties, to religious believers, and to our\ncolleagues on the lower courts to cure the problem this Court\ncreated.It\u2019s not as if we don\u2019t know the right answer.Smithhas been criticized since the day it was decided. No\nfewer than ten Justices\u2014including six sitting Justices\u2014have\nquestioned its fidelity to the Constitution. Seeante,at\n9\u201310 (Alito, J., concurring in judgment);ante, at 1\n(Barrett, J., concurring). The Court granted certiorari in this\ncase to resolve its fate. The parties andamiciresponded\nwith over 80 thoughtful briefs addressing every angle of the\nproblem. Justice Alito has offered a comprehensive opinion\nexplaining whySmithshould be overruled. And not a single\nJustice has lifted a pen to defend the decision. So what are we\nwaiting for?We hardly need to \u201cwrestle\u201d today with every\nconceivable question that might follow from recognizingSmithwas wrong. Seeante,at 2 (Barrett, J.,\nconcurring). To be sure, any time this Court turns from misguided\nprecedent back toward the Constitution\u2019s original public meaning,\nchallenging questions may arise across a large field of cases and\ncontroversies. But that\u2019s no excuse for refusing to apply the\noriginal public meaning in the dispute actually before us. Rather\nthan adhere toSmithuntil we settle on some \u201cgrand unified\ntheory\u201d of the Free Exercise Clause for all future cases until the\nend of time, seeAmerican Legionv.American Humanist\nAssn., 588 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2019) (plurality opinion) (slip\nop., at 24), the Court should overrule it now, set us back on the\ncorrect course, and address each case as it comes.What possible benefit does the majority see in\nits studious indecision aboutSmithwhen the costs are so\nmany? The particular appeal before us arises at the intersection of\npublic accommodations laws and the First Amendment; it involves\nsame-sex couples and the Catholic Church. Perhaps our colleagues\nbelieve today\u2019s circuitous path will at least steer the Court\naround the controversial subject matter and avoid \u201cpicking a side.\u201d\nBut refusing to give CSS the benefit of what we know to be the\ncorrect interpretation of the Constitutionispicking a\nside.Smithcommitted a constitutional error. Only we can\nfix it. Dodging the question today guarantees it will recur\ntomorrow. These cases will keep coming until the Court musters the\nfortitude to supply an answer. Respectfully, it should have done so\ntoday.",
