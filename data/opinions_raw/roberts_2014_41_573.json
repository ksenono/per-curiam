I write separately because I take a different view of\nwhat makes this provision \u201cambiguous\u201d under Chevron\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,\n467 U.\u00a0S. 837, 843 (1984) .As the plurality reads\nsection 1153(h)(3), the statute\u2019s two clauses address the issue\nbefore the Court \u201cin divergent ways\u201d and \u201cdo not easily cohere with\neach other.\u201d Ante, at 14. For the plurality, the first clause looks\n\u201ctoward the sweeping relief the respondents propose, which would\nreach every aged-out beneficiary of a family preference petition,\u201d\nwhile the second clause offers narrower relief that can help \u201conly\na subset of those beneficiaries.\u201d Ibid. Such \u201cill-fitting clauses,\u201d\nthe plurality says, \u201cleft the Board with a choice\u2014essentially of\nhow to reconcile the statute\u2019s different commands.\u201d Ante, at\n21.To the extent the\nplurality\u2019s opinion could be read to suggest that deference is\nwarranted because of a direct conflict between these clauses, that\nis wrong. Courts defer to an agency\u2019s reasonable construction of an\nambiguous statute because we presume that Congress intended to\nassign responsibility to resolve the ambiguity to the agency.\nChevron, supra, at 843\u2013844. But when Congress assigns to an agency\nthe responsibility for deciding whether a particular group should\nget relief, it does not do so by simultaneously saying that the\ngroup should and that it should not. Direct conflict is not\nambiguity, and the resolution of such a conflict is not statutory\nconstruction but legislative choice. Chevron is not a license for\nan agency to repair a statute that does not make sense.[1]I see no conflict, or\neven \u201cinternal tension,\u201d ante, at 14, in section 1153(h)(3). See\nFDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U.\u00a0S. 120,\n133 (2000) (we must \u201cinterpret the statute \u2018as a symmetrical and\ncoherent regulatory scheme,\u2019 and \u2018fit, if possible, all parts into\na[ ] harmonious whole\u2019\u00a0\u201d (citation omitted)).The statute reads:\u201cIf the age of an\nalien is determined under [section 1153(h)(1)] to be 21 years of\nage or older for the purposes of subsections (a)(2)(A) and (d) of\nthis section, the alien\u2019s petition shall automatically be converted\nto the appropriate category and the alien shall retain the original\npriority date issued upon receipt of the original petition.\u201d\n\u00a71153(h)(3).The first clause states\na condition\u2014one that beneficiaries from any preference category can\nmeet\u2014and thereby defines the persons potentially affected by this\nprovision. But the clause does not grant anything to anyone. I\ndisagree with the plurality that the first clause \u201cpoints toward\nbroad-based relief,\u201d ante, at 21, because I do not think the first\nclause points toward any relief at all.[2]Imagine a provision of\nthe Tax Code that read: \u201cIf a student is determined to be enrolled\nat an accredited university, the student\u2019s cost of off-campus\nhousing shall be deductible on her tax return.\u201d It would be\nimmediately apparent from that provision that an enrolled student\nwho lives on campus is not entitled to the deduction, even though\nthe student falls within the conditional first clause. And yet no\none would describe the two clauses as being in tension. If the\nInternal Revenue Service then interpreted the term \u201ccost of\noff-campus housing\u201d to exclude payments by a student who rents a\nhome from his parents, a court would determine whether that\ninterpretation was reasonable. The same is true in this\ncase.[3]The particular benefit\nprovided by section 1153(h)(3) is found exclusively in the second\nclause\u2014the only operative provision. There we are told what an\naged-out beneficiary (from whatever preference category) is\nentitled to: His petition \u201cshall automatically be converted to the\nappropriate category and the alien shall retain the original\npriority date.\u201d \u00a71153(h)(3). But automatic conversion is not\npossible for every beneficiary in every preference category, as the\nplurality convincingly demonstrates. Ante, at 15\u201319. Automatic\nconversion requires, at minimum, that the beneficiary have his own\nsponsor, who demonstrates that he is eligible to act as a sponsor,\nand who commits to providing financial support for the beneficiary.\nAnte, at 18. Some aged-out children will not meet those\nprerequisites, and they cannot benefit from automatic conversion\neven under respondents\u2019 interpretation of the statute.[4]Beyond those\nrequirements, however, Congress did not speak clearly to which\npetitions can \u201cautomatically be converted.\u201d \u00a71153(h)(3). Whatever\nother interpretations of that provision might be possible, it was\nreasonable, for the reasons explained by the plurality, for the\nBoard to interpret section 1153(h)(3) to provide relief only to a\nchild who was a principal or derivative beneficiary of an F2A\npetition. That interpretation is consistent with the ordinary\nmeaning of the statutory terms, with the established meaning of\nautomatic conversion in immigration law, and with the structure of\nthe family-based immigration system. Ante, at 15\u201320. It also avoids\nthe problems that would flow from respondents\u2019 proposed alternative\ninterpretations, including the suggestion that retention of the\noriginal priority date provides a benefit wholly separate from\nautomatic conversion. Ante, at 18\u201319, 22\u201332.I concur in the\njudgment.Notes1v. , 551U.\u00a0S. 644\n(2007), is not to the contrary. There the Court confrontedtwo\ndifferent statutes, enacted to address different problems, that\npre-sented \u201cseemingly categorical\u2014and, at first glance,\nirreconcilable\u2014legislative commands.\u201d at 661. We deferred to an\nagency\u2019s reasonable interpretation, which \u201charmonize[d] the\nstatutes,\u201d in large part because of our strong presumption that one\nstatute does not impliedly repeal another. at 662\u2013669. did not\naddress the consequences of a single statutory provision that\nappears to give divergent commands.2For the same reason, I do\nnot agree with the contention in \u2019s dissent that the first clause\nof section 1153(h)(3) unambiguously \u201canswers the precise question\nin this case.\u201d at 6.3\u2019s dissent accuses me of\n\u201cignor[ing]\u201d the first clause of section 1153(h)(3), \u201ctreating\n[that] clause as a nullity,\u201d and denying the clause \u201ceffect.\u201d at\n20\u201321. But that point is correct only if the reader adopts \u2019s own\npremise, that the first clause has operative effect on its own. I\ngive the statute\u2019s first clause precisely the (limited) effect it\nis meant to have: it defines who is affected by section 1153(h)(3).\ns response to the campus housing example proves my point by\nacknowledging that who gets relief under a statute depends entirely\non the meaning of the statute\u2019s operative provision, not on the\nreach of the introductory clause. See at 21. The Court would not\nreject a reasonable interpretation of the term \u201ccost of off-campus\nhousing,\u201d as \u2019s dissent would, simply because the IRS could have\ninterpreted the term to cover more students who fall within the\nprefatory clause.4s dissent is wrong that\n\u201cthe relief promised in \u00a71153(h)(3) (priority date retention and\nautomatic conversion) be given\u201d to every aged-out child in every\npreference category, at 21, and it therefore follows that the\nstatute is ambiguous.",
