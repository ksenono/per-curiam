But it also imposes an important\nconstraint: A State may not use race as the predominant factor in\ndrawing district lines unless it has a compelling reason. In this\ncase, a three-judge District Court ruled that North Carolina\nofficials violated that bar when they created two districts whose\nvoting-age populations were majority black. Applying a deferential\nstandard of review to the factual findings underlying thatdecision,\nwe affirm.IAThe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment limits racial gerrymanders in legislative districting\nplans. It prevents a State, in the absence of \u201csufficient\njustification,\u201d from \u201cseparating its citizens into different voting\ndistricts on the basis of race.\u201dBethune-Hillv.Virginia\nState Bd. of Elections, 580 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip\nop., at 6) (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted). When\na voter sues state officials for drawing such race-based lines, our\ndecisions call for a two-step analysis.First, the plaintiff must prove that \u201crace was\nthe predominant factor motivating the legislature\u2019s decision to\nplace a significant number of voters within or without a particular\ndistrict.\u201dMillerv.Johnson, 515 U.\u00a0S. 900, 916\n(1995) . That entails demonstrating that the legislature\n\u201csubordinated\u201d other factors\u2014compactness, respect for political\nsubdivisions, partisan advantage, what have you\u2014to \u201cracial\nconsiderations.\u201dIbid.The plaintiff may make the required\nshowing through \u201cdirect evidence\u201d of legislative intent,\n\u201ccircumstantial evidence of a district\u2019s shape and demographics,\u201d\nor a mix of both.Ibid.[1]Second, if racial considerations predominated\nover others, the design of the district must withstand strict\nscrutiny. SeeBethune-Hill, 580 U. S., at ____ (slip op., at\n13). The burden thus shifts to the State to prove that its\nrace-based sorting of voters serves a \u201ccompelling interest\u201d and is\n\u201cnarrowly tailored\u201d to that end.Ibid. This Court has long\nassumed that one compelling interest is complying with operative\nprovisions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (VRA or Act), 79Stat.\n437, as amended, 52 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a710301et seq. See,e.g.,Shawv.Hunt, 517 U.\u00a0S. 899, 915\n(1996) (Shaw II).Two provisions of the VRA\u2014\u00a72 and \u00a75\u2014are involved\nin this case. \u00a7\u00a710301, 10304. Section 2 prohibits any \u201cstandard,\npractice, or procedure\u201d that \u201cresults in a denial or abridgement of\nthe right .\u00a0.\u00a0. to vote on account of race.\u201d \u00a710301(a).\nWe have construed that ban to extend to \u201cvote dilution\u201d\u2014brought\nabout, most relevantly here, by the \u201cdispersal of [a group\u2019s\nmembers] into districts in which they constitute an ineffective\nminority of voters.\u201dThornburgv.Gingles, 478 U. S.\n30 , n.\u00a011 (1986). Section 5, at the time of the districting\nin dispute, worked through a different mechanism. Before this Court\ninvalidated its coverage formula, seeShelby Countyv.Holder, 570 U. S. __ (2013), that section required certain\njurisdictions (including various North Carolina counties) to\npre-clear voting changes with the Department of Justice, so as to\nforestall \u201cretrogression\u201d in the ability of racial minorities to\nelect their preferred candidates,Beerv.United\nStates, 425 U.\u00a0S. 130, 141 (1976) .When a State invokes the VRA to justify\nrace-based districting, it must show (to meet the \u201cnarrow\ntailoring\u201d requirement) that it had \u201ca strong basis in evidence\u201d\nfor concluding that the statute required its action.Alabama\nLegislative Black Caucusv.Alabama, 575 U.\u00a0S. ___,\n___ (2015) (slip op., at 22). Or said otherwise, the State must\nestablish that it had \u201cgood reasons\u201d to think that it would\ntransgress the Act if it didnotdraw race-based district\nlines.Ibid. That \u201cstrong basis\u201d (or \u201cgood reasons\u201d)\nstandard gives States \u201cbreathing room\u201d to adopt reasonable\ncompliance measures that may prove, in perfect hindsight, not to\nhave been needed.Bethune-Hill, 580 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 16).A district court\u2019s assessment of a districting\nplan, in accordance with the two-step inquiry just described,\nwarrants significant deference on appeal to this Court.[2] We of course retain full power to\ncorrect a court\u2019s errors of law, at either stage of the analysis.\nBut the court\u2019s findings of fact\u2014most notably, as to whether racial\nconsiderations predominated in drawing district lines\u2014are subject\nto review only for clear error. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 52(a)(6);Easleyv.Cromartie, 532 U. S. 234, 242 (2001)\n(Cromartie II);id.,at 259 (Thomas, J., dissenting).\nUnder that standard, we may not reverse just because we \u201cwould have\ndecided the [matter] differently.\u201dAndersonv.Bessemer\nCity, 470 U.\u00a0S. 564, 573 (1985) . A finding that is\n\u201cplausible\u201d in light of the full record\u2014even if another is equally\nor more so\u2014must govern.Id.,at 574.BThis case concerns North Carolina\u2019s most\nrecent redrawing of two congressional districts, both of which have\nlong included substantial populations of black voters. In its\ncurrent incarnation, District 1 is anchored in the northeastern\npart of the State, with appendages stretching both south and west\n(the latter into Durham). District 12 begins in the south-central\npart of the State (where it takes in a large part of Charlotte) and\nthen travels northeast, zig-zagging much of the way to the State\u2019s\nnorthern border. (Maps showing the districts are included in an\nappendix to this opinion.) Both have quite the history before this\nCourt.We first encountered the two districts, in their\n1992 versions, inShawv.Reno, 509 U.\u00a0S. 630\n(1993) . There, we held that voters stated an equal protection\nclaim by alleging that Districts 1 and 12 were unwarranted racial\ngerrymanders. Seeid., at 642, 649. After a remand to the\nDistrict Court, the case arrived back at our door. SeeShaw\nII, 517 U.\u00a0S. 899 . That time, we dismissed the challenge\nto District 1 for lack of standing, but struck down District 12.\nThe design of that \u201cserpentine\u201d district, we held, was nothing if\nnot race-centric, and could not be justified as a reasonable\nattempt to comply with the VRA.Id.,at 906; seeid.,at 911\u2013918.The next year, the State responded with a new\ndistricting plan, including a new District 12\u2014and residents of that\ndistrict brought another lawsuit alleging an impermissible racial\ngerrymander. A District Court sustained the claim twice, but both\ntimes this Court reversed. SeeHuntv.Cromartie, 526\nU.\u00a0S. 541 (1999) (Cromartie I);Cromartie II,\n532 U. S. 234 . Racial considerations, we held, did not predominate\nin designing the revised District 12. Rather, that district was the\nresult of apoliticalgerrymander\u2014an effort to engineer,\nmostly \u201cwithout regard to race,\u201d a safe Democratic seat.Id., at 245.The State redrew its congressional districts\nagain in 2001, to account for population changes revealed in the\nprior year\u2019s census. Under the 2001 map, which went unchallenged in\ncourt, neither District 1 nor District 12 had a black voting-age\npopulation (called a \u201cBVAP\u201d) that was a majority of the whole: The\nformer had a BVAP of around 48%, the latter a BVAP of around 43%.\nSee App. 312, 503. Nonetheless, in five successive general\nelections conducted in those reconfigured districts, all the\ncandidates preferred by most African-American voters won their\ncontests\u2014and by some handy margins. In District 1, black voters\u2019\ncandidates of choice garnered as much as 70% of the total vote, and\nnever less than 59%. See 5 Record 636, 638, 641, 645, 647 (Pls.\nExh. 112). And in District 12, those candidates won with 72% of the\nvote at the high end and 64% at the low. Seeid.,at 637,\n640, 643, 646, 650.Another census, in 2010, necessitated yet\nanother congressional map\u2014(finally) the one at issue in this case.\nState Senator Robert Rucho and State Representative David Lewis,\nboth Republicans, chaired the two committees jointly responsible\nfor preparing the revamped plan. They hired Dr. Thomas Hofeller, a\nveteran political mapmaker, to assist them in redrawing district\nlines. Several hearings, drafts, and revisions later, both chambers\nof the State\u2019s General Assembly adopted the scheme the three men\nproposed.The new map (among other things) significantly\naltered both District 1 and District 12. The 2010 census had\nrevealed District 1 to be substantially underpopulated: To comply\nwith the Constitution\u2019s one-person-one-vote principle, the State\nneeded to place almost 100,000 new people within the district\u2019s\nboundaries. See App. 2690;Evenwelv.Abbott, 578\nU.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 3) (explaining that\n\u201c[s]tates must draw congressional districts with populations as\nclose to perfect equality as possible\u201d). Rucho, Lewis, and Hofeller\nchose to take most of those people from heavily black areas of\nDurham, requiring a finger-like extension of the district\u2019s western\nline. See Appendix,infra. With that addition, District 1\u2019s\nBVAP rose from 48.6% to 52.7%. See App. 312\u2013313. District 12, for\nits part, had no need for significant total-population changes: It\nwas overpopulated by fewer than 3,000 people out of over 730,000.\nSeeid., at 1150. Still, Rucho, Lewis, and Hofeller decided\nto reconfigure the district, further narrowing its already\nsnakelike body while adding areas at either end\u2014most relevantly\nhere, in Guilford County. See Appendix,infra; App. 1164.\nThose changes appreciably shifted the racial composition of\nDistrict 12: As the district gained some 35,000 African-Americans\nof voting age and lost some 50,000 whites of that age, its BVAP\nincreased from 43.8% to 50.7%. See 2 Record 349 (Fourth Affidavit\nof Dan Frey, Exh. 5);id.,at 416 (Exh. 11).Registered voters in the two districts (David\nHarris and Christine Bowser, here called \u201cthe plaintiffs\u201d) brought\nthis suit against North Carolina officials (collectively, \u201cthe\nState\u201d or \u201cNorth Carolina\u201d), complaining of impermissible racial\ngerrymanders. After a bench trial, a three-judge District Court\nheld both districts unconstitutional. All the judges agreed that\nracial considerations predominated in the design of District 1. SeeHarrisv.McCrory, 159 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d 600, 611\n(MDNC 2016). And in then applying strict scrutiny, all rejected the\nState\u2019s argument that it had a \u201cstrong basis\u201d for thinking that the\nVRA compelled such a race-based drawing of District 1\u2019s lines.Id.,at 623. As for District 12, a majority of the panel\nheld that \u201crace predominated\u201d over all other factors, including\npartisanship.Id., at 622. And the court explained that the\nState had failed to put forward any reason, compelling or\notherwise, for its attention to race in designing that district.\nSeeibid.Judge Osteen dissented from the conclusion that\nrace, rather than politics, drove District 12\u2019s lines\u2014yet still\ncharacterized the majority\u2019s view as \u201c[e]minently reasonable.\u201dId., at 640.The State filed a notice of appeal, and we noted\nprobable jurisdiction.McCroryv.Harris, 579\nU.\u00a0S. ___ (2016).IIWe address at the outset North Carolina\u2019s\ncontention that a victory it won in a very similar state-court\nlawsuit should dictate (or at least influence) our disposition of\nthis case. As the State explains, the North Carolina NAACP and\nseveral other civil rights groups challenged Districts 1 and 12 in\nstate court immediately after their enactment, charging that they\nwere unlawful racial gerrymanders. See Brief for Appellants 19\u201320.\nBy the time the plaintiffs before us filed this action, the state\ntrial court, inDicksonv.Rucho, had rejected those\nclaims\u2014finding that in District 1 the VRA justified the General\nAssembly\u2019s use of race and that in District 12 race was not a\nfactor at all. See App. 1969. The North Carolina Supreme Court then\naffirmed that decision by a 4\u20133 vote, applying the state-court\nequivalent of clear error review. SeeDicksonv.Rucho, 368 N.\u00a0C. 481, 500, 781 S. E. 2d 404, 419\n(2015), modified on denial of reh\u2019g, 368 N.\u00a0C. 673, 789\nS.\u00a0E. 2d 436 (2016), cert. pending, No. 16\u201324. In this Court,\nNorth Carolina makes two related arguments based on theDicksonlitigation: first, that the state trial court\u2019s\njudgment should have barred this case altogether, under familiar\nprinciples of claim and issue preclusion; and second, that the\nstate court\u2019s conclusions should cause us to conduct a \u201csearching\nreview\u201d of the decision below, rather than deferring (as usual) to\nits factual findings. Reply Brief 6.The State\u2019s preclusion theory rests on an\nassertion about how the plaintiffs in the two cases are affiliated.\nAs the State acknowledges, one person\u2019s lawsuit generally does not\nbar another\u2019s, no matter how similar they are in substance. SeeTaylorv.Sturgell, 553 U. S. 880 \u2013893 (2008) (noting\nthe \u201cdeep-rooted historic tradition that everyone should have his\nown day in court\u201d). But when plaintiffs in two cases have a special\nrelationship, a judgment against one can indeed bind both. Seeid.,at 893\u2013895 (describing six categories of qualifying\nrelationships). The State contends that Harris and Bowser, the\nplaintiffs here, are members of organizations that were plaintiffs\ninDickson. And according to North Carolina, that connection\nprevents the pair from raising anew the questions that the state\ncourt previously resolved against those groups. See Brief for\nAppellants 20\u201321.But North Carolina never satisfied the District\nCourt that the alleged affiliation really existed. When the State\nargued that its preclusion theory entitled it to summary judgment,\nHarris and Bowser responded that they were not members of any of\nthe organizations that had brought theDicksonsuit. See 3\nRecord 1577\u20131582 (Defs. Motion for Summary Judgment); 4 Record\n101\u2013106 (Pls. Opposition to Motion for Summary Judgment). The\nparties\u2019 dueling contentions turned on intricate issues about those\ngroups\u2019 membership policies (e.g.,could Harris\u2019s payment of\ndues to the national NAACP, or Bowser\u2019s financial contribution to\nthe Mecklenburg County NAACP, have made either a member of the\nstate branch?). Because of those unresolved \u201cfactual disputes,\u201d the\nDistrict Court denied North Carolina\u2019s motion for summary judgment.\n4 Record 238 (July 29, 2014 Order). And nothing in the subsequent\ntrial supported the State\u2019s assertion about Harris\u2019s and Bowser\u2019s\norganizational ties: Indeed, the State chose not to present any\nfurther evidence relating to the membership issue. Based on the\nresulting record, the District Court summarily rejected the State\u2019s\nclaim that Harris and Bowser were something other than independent\nplaintiffs. See 159 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at 609.That conclusion defeats North Carolina\u2019s attempt\nto argue for claim or issue preclusion here. We have no basis for\nassessing the factual assertions underlying the State\u2019s argument\nany differently than the District Court did. Nothing in the State\u2019s\nevidence clearly rebuts Harris\u2019s and Bowser\u2019s testimony that they\nnever joined any of theDicksongroups. We need not decide\nwhether the alleged memberships would have supported preclusion if\nthey had been proved. It is enough that the District Court\nreason-ably thought they had not.The State\u2019s back-up argument about our standard\nof review also falls short. The rule that we review a trial court\u2019s\nfactual findings for clear error contains no exception for findings\nthat diverge from those made in another court. See Fed. Rule Civ.\nProc. 52(a)(6) (\u201cFindings of fact .\u00a0.\u00a0. must not be set\naside unless clearly erroneous\u201d); see alsoHernandezv.New York, 500 U.\u00a0S. 352, 369 (1991) (plurality opinion)\n(applying the same standard to a state court\u2019s findings). Whatever\nfindings are under review receive the benefit of deference, without\nregard to whether a court in a separate suit has seen the matter\ndifferently. So here, we must ask not which court considering\nDistricts 1 and 12 had the better view of the facts, but simply\nwhether the court below\u2019s view is clearly wrong. That does not mean\nthe state court\u2019s decision is wholly irrelevant: It is common sense\nthat, all else equal, a finding is more likely to be plainly wrong\nif some judges disagree with it. Cf.Glossipv.Gross, 576 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2015) (slip op., at 17)\n(noting that we are even less likely to disturb a factual\ndetermination when \u201cmultiple trial courts have reached the same\nfinding\u201d). But the very premise of clear error review is that there\nare often \u201ctwo permissible\u201d\u2014because two \u201cplausible\u201d\u2014\u201cviews of the\nevidence.\u201dAnderson, 470 U.\u00a0S., at 574; seesupra,at 4. Even assuming the state court\u2019s findings\ncapture one such view, the District Court\u2019s assessment may yet\nrepresent another. And the permissibility of the District Court\u2019s\naccount is the only question before us.IIIWith that out of the way, we turn to the\nmerits of this case, beginning (appropriately enough) with District\n1. As noted above, the court below found that race furnished the\npredominant rationale for that district\u2019s redesign. Seesupra,at 6\u20137. And it held that the State\u2019s interest in\ncomplying with the VRA could not justify that consideration of\nrace. Seesupra,at 7.We uphold both\nconclusions.AUncontested evidence in the record shows that\nthe State\u2019s mapmakers, in considering District 1, purposefully\nestablished a racial target: African-Americans should make up no\nless than a majority of the voting-age population. See 159 F. Supp.\n3d, at 611\u2013614. Senator Rucho and Representative Lewis were not coy\nin expressing that goal. They repeatedly told their colleagues that\nDistrict 1 had to be majority-minority, so as to comply with the\nVRA. During a Senate debate, for example, Rucho explained that\nDistrict 1 \u201cmust include a sufficient number of African-Americans\u201d\nto make it \u201ca majority black district.\u201d App. 689\u2013690. Similarly,\nLewis informed the House and Senate redistricting committees that\nthe district must have \u201ca majority black voting age population.\u201dId., at 610. And that objective was communicated in no\nuncertain terms to the legislators\u2019 consultant. Dr. Hofeller\ntestified multiple times at trial that Rucho and Lewis instructed\nhim \u201cto draw [District 1] with a [BVAP] in excess of 50 percent.\u201d\n159 F. Supp. 3d, at 613; see,e.g.,ibid.(\u201cOnce\nagain, my instructions [were] that the district had to be drawn at\nabove 50 percent\u201d).Hofeller followed those directions to the\nletter, such that the 50%-plus racial target \u201chad a direct and\nsignificant impact\u201d on District 1\u2019s configuration.Alabama,\n575 U.\u00a0S., at __ (slip op., at 17). In particular, Hofeller\nmoved the district\u2019s borders to encompass the heavily black parts\nof Durham (and only those parts), thus taking in tens of thousands\nof additional African-American voters. That change and similar\nones, made (in his words) to ensure that the district\u2019s racial\ncomposition would \u201cadd[\u00a0] up correctly,\u201d deviated from the\ndistricting practices he other-wise would have followed. App. 2802.\nHofeller candidly admitted that point: For example, he testified,\nhe sometimes could not respect county or precinct lines as he\nwished because \u201cthe more important thing\u201d was to create a\nmajority-minority district.Id., at 2807; seeid., at\n2809. The result is a district with stark racial borders: Within\nthe same counties, the portions that fall inside District 1 have\nblack populations two to three times larger than the portions\nplaced in neighboring districts. See Brief for United States asAmicus Curiae19; cf.Alabama, 575 U.\u00a0S., at\n___\u2013___ (slip op., at 17\u201318) (relying on similar evidence to find\nracial predominance).Faced with this body of evidence\u2014showing an\nannounced racial target that subordinated other districting\ncriteria and produced boundaries amplifying divisions between\nblacks and whites\u2014the District Court did not clearly err in finding\nthat race predominated in drawing District 1. Indeed, as all three\njudges recognized, the court could hardly have concluded anything\nbut. See 159 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at 611 (calling District 1 a\n\u201ctextbook example\u201d of race-based districting).[3]BThe more substantial question is whether\nDistrict 1 can survive the strict scrutiny applied to racial\ngerrymanders. As noted earlier, we have long assumed that complying\nwith the VRA is a compelling interest. Seesupra,at 2. And\nwe have held that race-based districting is narrowly tailored to\nthat objective if a State had \u201cgood reasons\u201d for thinking that the\nAct demanded such steps. Seesupra,at 3. North Carolina\nargues that District 1 passes muster under that standard: The\nGeneral Assembly (so says the State) had \u201cgood reasons to believe\nit needed to draw [District 1] as a majority-minority district to\navoid Section 2 liability\u201d for vote dilution. Brief for Appellants\n52. We now turn to that defense.This Court identified, inThornburgv.Gingles, three threshold conditions for proving vote\ndilution under \u00a72 of the VRA. See 478 U.\u00a0S., at 50\u201351. First,\na \u201cminority group\u201d must be \u201csufficiently large and geographically\ncompact to constitute a majority\u201d in some reasonably configured\nlegislative district.Id.,at 50. Second, the minority group\nmust be \u201cpolitically cohesive.\u201dId.,at 51. And third, a\ndistrict\u2019s white majority must \u201cvote[\u00a0] sufficiently as a\nbloc\u201d to usually \u201cdefeat the minority\u2019s preferred candidate.\u201dIbid. Those three showings, we have explained, are needed to\nestablish that \u201cthe minority [group] has the potential to elect a\nrepresentative of its own choice\u201d in a possible district, but that\nracially polarized voting prevents it from doing so in the district\nas actually drawn because it is \u201csubmerg[ed] in a larger white\nvoting population.\u201dGrowev.Emison, 507 U.\u00a0S.\n25, 40 (1993) . If a State has good reason to think that all the\n\u201cGinglespreconditions\u201d are met, then so too it has good\nreason to believe that \u00a72 requires drawing a majority-minority\ndistrict. SeeBushv.Vera, 517 U.\u00a0S. 952, 978\n(1996) (plurality opinion). But if not, then not.Here, electoral history provided no evidence\nthat a \u00a72 plaintiff could demonstrate the thirdGinglesprerequisite\u2014effective white bloc-voting.[4] For most of the twenty years prior to the new plan\u2019s\nadoption, African-Americans had made up less than a majority of\nDistrict 1\u2019s voters; the district\u2019s BVAP usually hovered between\n46% and 48%. See 159 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at 606; App. 312. Yet\nthroughout those two decades, as the District Court noted, District\n1 was \u201can extraordinarily safe district for African-American\npreferred candidates.\u201d 159 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d,at 626. In theclosestelection during that period, African-Americans\u2019\ncandidate of choice received 59% of the total vote; in other years,\nthe share of the vote garnered by those candidates rose to as much\nas 70%. Seesupra,at 5. Those victories (indeed,\nlandslides) occurred because the district\u2019s white population didnot\u201cvote[\u00a0] sufficiently as a bloc\u201d to thwart black\nvoters\u2019 preference,Gingles, 478 U.\u00a0S., at 51; rather,\na meaningful number of white voters joined a politically cohesive\nblack community to elect that group\u2019s favored candidate. In the\nlingo of voting law, District 1 functioned, election year in and\nelection year out, as a \u201ccross-over\u201d district, in which members of\nthe majority help a \u201clarge enough\u201d minority to elect its candidate\nof choice.Bartlettv.Strickland, 556 U. S. 1, 13\n(2009) (plurality opinion). When voters act in that way, \u201c[i]t is\ndifficult to see how the majority-bloc-voting requirement could be\nmet\u201d\u2014and hence how \u00a72 liability could be established.Id.,at 16. So experience gave the State no reason to think that the VRA\nrequired it to ramp up District 1\u2019s BVAP.The State counters that, in this context, past\nperformance is no guarantee of future results. See Brief for\nAppellants 57\u201358; Reply Brief 19\u201320. Recall here that the State had\nto redraw its whole congressional map following the 2010 census.\nSeesupra,at 5. And in particular, the State had to add\nnearly 100,000 new people to District 1 to meet the\none-person-one-vote standard. Seesupra, at 6.That\nmeant about 13% of the voters in the new district would never have\nvoted there before. See App. 2690; Reply Brief 20. So, North\nCarolina contends, the question facing the state mapmakers was not\nwhether thethen-existingDistrict 1 violated \u00a72. Rather,\nthe question was whether thefutureDistrict 1 would do so\nif drawn without regard to race. And that issue, the State claims,\ncould not be resolved by \u201cfocusing myopically on past elections.\u201dId., at 19.But that reasoning, taken alone, cannot justify\nNorth Carolina\u2019s race-based redesign of District 1. True enough, a\nlegislature undertaking a redistricting must assess whether the new\ndistricts it contemplates (not the old ones it sheds) conform to\nthe VRA\u2019s requirements. And true too, an inescapable influx of\nadditional voters into a district may suggest the possibility that\nits former track record of compliance can continue only if the\nlegislature intentionally adjusts its racial composition. Still,\nNorth Carolina too far downplays the significance of a longtime\npattern of white crossover voting in the area that would form the\ncore of the redrawn District 1. SeeGingles, 478 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 57 (noting that longtime voting patterns are highly probative of\nracial polarization). And even more important, North Carolina can\npoint to no meaningful legislative inquiry into what it now rightly\nidentifies as the key issue: whether a new, enlarged District 1,\ncreated without a focus on race but however else the State would\nchoose, could lead to \u00a72 liability. The prospect of a significant\npopulation increase in a district only raises\u2014it does not\nanswer\u2014the question whether \u00a72 requires deliberate measures to\naugment the district\u2019s BVAP. (Indeed, such population growth could\ncut in either direction, depending on who comes into the district.)\nTo have a strong basis in evidence to conclude that \u00a72 demands such\nrace-based steps, the State must carefully evaluate whether a\nplaintiff could establish theGinglespreconditions\u2014including effective white bloc-voting\u2014in a new\ndistrict created without those measures. We see nothing in the\nlegislative record that fits that description.[5]And that absence is no accident: Rucho and Lewis\nproceeded under a wholly different theory\u2014arising not fromGinglesbut fromBartlettv.Strickland\u2014of\nwhat \u00a72 demanded in drawing District 1.Stricklandinvolved\na geographic area in which African-Americans could not form a\nmajority of a reasonably compact district. See 556 U.\u00a0S., at 8\n(plurality opinion). The African-American community, however, was\nsizable enough to enable the formation of a crossover district, in\nwhich a substantial bloc of black voters, if receiving help from\nsome white ones, could elect the candidates of their choice. Seesupra,at 14. A plurality of this Court, invoking the firstGinglesprecondition, held that \u00a72 did not require creating\nthat district: When a minority group is not sufficiently large to\nmake up a majority in a reasonably shaped district, \u00a72 simply does\nnot apply. See 556 U.\u00a0S., at 18\u201320. Over and over in the\nlegislative record, Rucho and Lewis citedStricklandas\nmandating a 50%-plus BVAP in District 1. See App. 355\u2013356, 363\u2013364,\n472\u2013474, 609\u2013610, 619, 1044. They apparently reasoned that if, asStricklandheld, \u00a72 does notrequirecrossover\ndistricts (for groups insufficiently large underGingles),\nthen \u00a72 also cannot besatisfied bycrossover districts (for\ngroups in fact meetingGingles\u2019 size condition). In effect,\nthey concluded, whenever a legislaturecandraw a\nmajority-minority district, itmustdo so\u2014even if a\ncrossover district would also allow the minority group to elect its\nfavored candidates. See 1 Tr. 21\u201322 (counsel\u2019s explanation that\n\u201cthe [S]tate interpreted\u201dStricklandto say that, in order\nto protect African-Americans\u2019 electoral strength and thus avoid \u00a72\nliability, the BVAP in District 1 \u201cneed[ed] to be above 50\npercent\u201d).That idea, though, is at war with our \u00a72\njurisprudence\u2014Stricklandincluded. Under the State\u2019s view,\nthe thirdGinglescondition is no condition at all, because\neven in the absence of effective white bloc-voting, a \u00a72 claim\ncould succeed in a district (like the old District 1) with an\nunder-50% BVAP. But this Court has made clear that unlesseachof the threeGinglesprerequisites is\nestablished, \u201cthere neither has been a wrong nor can be a remedy.\u201dGrowe, 507 U.\u00a0S., at 41. AndStrickland, far\nfrom supporting North Carolina\u2019s view, underscored the necessity of\ndemonstrating effective white bloc-voting to prevail in a \u00a72\nvote-dilution suit. The plurality explained that \u201c[i]n areas with\nsubstantial crossover voting,\u201d \u00a72 plaintiffs would not \u201cbe able to\nestablish the thirdGinglesprecondition\u201d and so\n\u201cmajority-minority districts would not be required.\u201d 556\nU.\u00a0S., at 24; see alsoibid.(noting that States can\n\u201cdefend against alleged \u00a72 violations by pointing to crossover\nvoting patterns and to effective crossover districts\u201d). Thus, North\nCarolina\u2019s belief that it was compelled to redraw District 1 (a\nsuccessful crossover district) as a majority-minority district\nrested not on a \u201cstrong basis in evidence,\u201d but instead on a pure\nerror of law.Alabama, 575 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at\n22).In sum: Although States enjoy leeway to take\nrace-based actions reasonably judged necessary under a proper\ninterpretation of the VRA, that latitude cannot rescue District 1.\nWe by no means \u201cinsist that a state legislature, when\nredistricting, determinepreciselywhat percent minority\npopulation [\u00a72 of the VRA] demands.\u201dIbid. But neither will\nwe approve a racial gerrymander whose necessity is supported by no\nevidence and whoseraison d\u2019\u00eatreis a legal mistake.\nAccordingly, we uphold the District Court\u2019s conclusion that North\nCarolina\u2019s use of race as the predominant factor in designing\nDistrict 1 does not withstand strict scrutiny.IVWe now look west to District 12, making its\nfifth(!) appearance before this Court. This time, the district\u2019s\nlegality turns, and turns solely, on which of two possible reasons\npredominantly explains its most recent reconfiguration. The\nplaintiffs contended at trial that the General Assembly chose\nvoters for District 12, as for District 1, because of their race;\nmore particularly, they urged that the Assembly intentionally\nincreased District 12\u2019s BVAP in the name of ensuring preclearance\nunder the VRA\u2019s \u00a75. But North Carolina declined to mount any\ndefense (similar to the one we have just considered for District 1)\nthat \u00a75\u2019s requirements in fact justified race-based changes to\nDistrict 12\u2014perhaps because \u00a75 could not reasonably be understood\nto have done so, see n.\u00a010,infra. Instead, the State\naltogether denied that racial considerations accounted for (or,\nindeed, played the slightest role in) District 12\u2019s redesign.\nAccording to the State\u2019s version of events, Senator Rucho,\nRepresentative Lewis, and Dr. Hofeller moved voters in and out of\nthe district as part of a \u201cstrictly\u201d political gerrymander, without\nregard to race. 6 Record 1011. The mapmakers drew their lines, in\nother words, to \u201cpack\u201d District 12 with Democrats, not\nAfrican-Americans. After hearing evidence supporting both parties\u2019\naccounts, the District Court accepted the plaintiffs\u2019.[6]Getting to the bottom of a dispute like this one\nposes special challenges for a trial court. In the more usual case\nalleging a racial gerrymander\u2014where no one has raised a\npartisanship defense\u2014the court can make real headway by exploring\nthe challenged district\u2019s conformity to traditional districting\nprinciples, such as compactness and respect for county lines. InShaw II, for example, this Court emphasized the \u201chighly\nirregular\u201d shape of then-District 12 in concluding that race\npredominated in its design. 517 U.\u00a0S., at 905 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). But such evidence loses much of its value\nwhen the State asserts partisanship as a defense, because a bizarre\nshape\u2014as of the new District 12\u2014can arise from a \u201cpolitical\nmotivation\u201d as well as a racial one.Cromartie I, 526\nU.\u00a0S., at 547, n.\u00a03. And crucially, political and racial\nreasons are capable of yielding similar oddities in a district\u2019s\nboundaries. That is because, of course, \u201cracial identification is\nhighly correlated with political affiliation.\u201dCromartie II,\n532 U.\u00a0S., at 243. As a result of those redistricting\nrealities, a trial court has a formidable task: It must make \u201ca\nsensitive inquiry\u201d into all \u201ccircumstantial and direct evidence of\nintent\u201d to assess whether the plaintiffs have managed to\ndisentangle race from politics and prove that the former drove a\ndistrict\u2019s lines.Cromartie I, 526 U.\u00a0S., at 546\n(internal quotation marks omitted).[7]Our job is different\u2014and generally easier. As\ndescribed earlier, we review a district court\u2019s finding as to\nracial predominance only for clear error, except when the court\nmade a legal mistake. Seesupra,at 3\u20134. Under that standard\nof review, we affirm the court\u2019s finding so long as it is\n\u201cplausible\u201d; we reverse only when \u201cleft with the definite and firm\nconviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201dAnderson,470\nU.\u00a0S., at 573\u2013574; seesupra,at 4. And in deciding\nwhich side of that line to come down on, we give singular deference\nto a trial court\u2019s judgments about the credibility of witnesses.\nSee Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 52(a)(6). That is proper, we have\nexplained, because the various cues that \u201cbear so heavily on the\nlistener\u2019s understanding of and belief in what is said\u201d are lost on\nan appellate court later sifting through a paper record.Anderson, 470 U.\u00a0S., at 575.[8]In light of those principles, we uphold the\nDistrict Court\u2019s finding of racial predominance respecting District\n12. The evidence offered at trial, including live witness testimony\nsubject to credibility determinations, adequately supports the\nconclusion that race, not politics, accounted for the district\u2019s\nreconfiguration. And no error of law infected that judgment:\nContrary to North Carolina\u2019s view, the District Court had no call\nto dismiss this challenge just because the plaintiffs did not\nproffer an alternative design for District 12 as circumstantial\nevidence of the legislature\u2019s intent.ABegin with some facts and figures, showing how\nthe redistricting of District 12 affected its racial composition.\nAs explained above, District 12 (unlike District 1) was\napproximately the right size as it was: North Carolina did\nnot\u2014indeed, could not\u2014much change its total population. Seesupra,at 6. But by further slimming the district and adding\na couple of knobs to its snakelike body (including in Guilford\nCounty), the General Assembly incorporated tens of thousands of new\nvoters and pushed out tens of thousands of old ones. And those\nchanges followed racial lines: To be specific, the new District 12\nhad 35,000 more African-Americans of voting age and 50,000 fewer\nwhites of that age. (The difference was made up of voters from\nother racial categories.) Seeibid. Those voter exchanges\nproduced a sizable jump in the district\u2019s BVAP, from 43.8% to\n50.7%. Seeibid.The Assembly thus turned District 12 (as it\ndid District 1, seesupra,at 10\u201311) into a\nmajority-minority district.As the plaintiffs pointed out at trial, Rucho\nand Lewis had publicly stated that racial considerations lay behind\nDistrict 12\u2019s augmented BVAP. In a release issued along with their\ndraft districting plan, the two legislators ascribed that change to\nthe need to achieve preclearance of the plan under \u00a75 of the VRA.\nSee App. 358. At that time, \u00a75 covered Guilford County and thus\nprohibited any \u201cretrogression in the [electoral] position of racial\nminorities\u201d there.Beer, 425 U.\u00a0S., at 141; see 31 Fed.\nReg. 5081 (1966). And part of Guilford County lay within District\n12, which meant that the Department of Justice would closely\nscrutinize that district\u2019s new lines. In light of those facts,\nRucho and Lewis wrote: \u201cBecause of the presence of Guilford County\nin the Twelfth District, we have drawn our proposed Twelfth\nDistrict at a [BVAP] level that is above the percentage of [BVAP]\nfound in the current Twelfth District.\u201d App. 358. According to the\ntwo legislators, that race-based \u201cmeasure w[ould] ensure\npreclearance of the plan.\u201dIbid.Thus, the District Court\nfound, Rucho\u2019s and Lewis\u2019s own account \u201cevince[d] intentionality\u201d\nas to District 12\u2019s racial composition:Because ofthe VRA,\nthey increased the number of African-Americans. 159 F.\u00a0Supp.\n3d, at 617.Hofeller confirmed that intent in both\ndeposition testimony and an expert report. Before the\nredistricting, Hofeller testified, some black residents of Guilford\nCounty fell within District 12 while others fell within neighboring\nDistrict 13. The legislators, he continued, \u201cdecided to reunite the\nblack community in Guilford County into the Twelfth.\u201d App. 558; seeid.,at 530\u2013531. Why? Hofeller responded, in language the\nDistrict Court emphasized: \u201c[I]n order to be cautious and draw a\nplan that would pass muster under the Voting Rights Act.\u201dId.,at 558; see 159 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at 619. Likewise,\nHofeller\u2019s expert report highlighted the role of the VRA in\naltering District 12\u2019s lines. \u201c[M]indful that Guilford County was\ncovered\u201d by \u00a75, Hofeller explained, the legislature \u201cdetermined\nthat it was prudent to reunify [the county\u2019s] African-American\ncommunity\u201d into District 12. App. 1103. That change caused the\ndistrict\u2019s compactness to decrease (in expert-speak, it \u201clowered\nthe Reock Score\u201d), but that was a sacrifice well worth making: It\nwould \u201cavoid the possibility of a [VRA] charge\u201d that would\n\u201cinhibit[\u00a0] preclearance.\u201dIbid.The State\u2019s preclearance submission to the\nJustice Department indicated a similar determination to concentrate\nblack voters in District 12. \u201cOne of the concerns of the\nRedistricting Chairs,\u201d North Carolina there noted, had to do with\nthe Justice Department\u2019s years-old objection to \u201ca failure by the\nState to create a second majority minority district\u201d (that is, in\naddition to District 1).Id., at 478. The submission then\nwent on to explain that after considering alternatives, the\nredistricters had designed a version of District 12 that would\nraise its BVAP to 50.7%. Thus, concluded the State, the new\nDistrict 12 \u201cincreases[\u00a0] the African-American community\u2019s\nability to elect their candidate of choice.\u201dId., at 479. In\nthe District Court\u2019s view, that passage once again indicated that\nmaking District 12 majority-minority was no \u201cmere coincidence,\u201d but\na deliberate attempt to avoid perceived obstacles to preclearance.\n159 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at 617.[9]And still there was more: Perhaps the most\ndramatic testimony in the trial came when Congressman Mel Watt (who\nhad represented District 12 for some 20 years) recounted a\nconversation he had with Rucho in 2011 about the district\u2019s future\nmake-up. According to Watt, Rucho said that \u201chis leadership had\ntold him that he had to ramp the minority percentage in [District\n12] up to over 50 percent to comply with the Voting Rights Law.\u201d\nApp. 2369; seeid., at 2393. And further, that it would then\nbe Rucho\u2019s \u201cjob to go and convince the African-American community\u201d\nthat such a racial target \u201cmade sense\u201d under the Act.Ibid.;\nseeid., at 2369.[10]\nThe District Court cred-ited Watt\u2019s testimony about the\nconversation, citing his courtroom demeanor and \u201cconsistent\nrecollection\u201d under \u201cprobing cross-examination.\u201d 159 F.\u00a0Supp.\n3d, at 617\u2013618.[11] In the\ncourt\u2019s view, Watt\u2019s account was of a piece with all the other\nevidence\u2014including the redistricters\u2019 on-the-nose attainment of a\n50% BVAP\u2014indicating that the General Assembly, in the name of VRA\ncompliance, deliberately redrew District 12 as a majority-minority\ndistrict. Seeid.,at 618.[12]The State\u2019s contrary story\u2014that politics alone\ndrove decisionmaking\u2014came into the trial mostly through Hofeller\u2019s\ntestimony. Hofeller explained that Rucho and Lewis instructed him,\nfirst and foremost, to make the map as a whole \u201cmore favorable to\nRepublican candidates.\u201d App. 2682. One agreed-on stratagem in that\neffort was to pack the historically Democratic District 12 with\neven more Democratic voters, thus leaving surrounding districts\nmore reliably Republican. Seeid., at 2682\u20132683, 2696\u20132697.\nTo that end, Hofeller recounted, he drew District 12\u2019s new\nboundaries based on political data\u2014specifically, the voting\nbehavior of precincts in the 2008 Presidential election between\nBarack Obama and John McCain. Seeid., at 2701\u20132702. Indeed,\nhe claimed, he displayed only this data, and no racial data, on his\ncomputer screen while mapping the district. Seeid., at\n2721. In part of his testimony, Hofeller further stated that the\nObama-McCain election data explained (among other things) his\nincorporation of the black, but not the white, parts of Guilford\nCounty then located in District 13. Seeid., at 2824. Onlyafterhe drew a politics-based line between those adjacent\nareas, Hofeller testified, did he \u201ccheck[\u00a0]\u201d the racial data\nand \u201cf[ind] out\u201d that the resulting configuration of District 12\n\u201cdid not have a [\u00a75] issue.\u201dId., at 2822.The District Court, however, disbelieved\nHofeller\u2019s asserted indifference to the new district\u2019s racial\ncomposition. The court recalled Hofeller\u2019s contrary deposition\ntestimony\u2014his statement (repeated in only slightly different words\nin his expert report) that Rucho and Lewis \u201cdecided\u201d to shift\nAfrican-American voters into District 12 \u201cin order to\u201d ensure\npreclearance under \u00a75. See 159 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at 619\u2013620; App.\n558. And the court explained that even at trial, Hofeller had given\ntestimony that undermined his \u201cblame it on politics\u201d claim. Right\nafter asserting that Rucho and Lewis had told him \u201c[not] to use\nrace\u201d in designing District 12, Hofeller added a qualification:\n\u201cexcept perhaps with regard to Guilford County.\u201dId., at\n2791; seeid., at 2790. As the District Court understood,\nthat is the kind of \u201cexception\u201d that goes pretty far toward\nswallowing the rule. District 12 saw a net increase of more than\n25,000 black voters in Guilford County, relative to a net gain of\nfewer than 35,000 across the district: So the newly added parts of\nthat county played a major role in pushing the district\u2019s BVAP over\n50%. Seeid., at 384, 500\u2013502.[13] The District Court came away from Hofeller\u2019s\nself-contradictory testimony unpersuaded that this decisive influx\nof black voters was an accident. Whether the racial make-up of the\ncounty was displayed on his computer screen or just fixed in his\nhead, the court thought, Hofeller\u2019s denial of race-based\ndistricting \u201cr[ang] hollow.\u201d 159 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at 620,\nn.\u00a08.Finally, an expert report by Dr. Stephen\nAnsolabehere lent circumstantial support to the plaintiffs\u2019\nrace-not-politics case. Ansolabehere looked at the six counties\noverlapping with District 12\u2014essentially the region from which the\nmapmakers could have drawn the district\u2019s population. The question\nhe asked was: Who from those counties actually ended up in District\n12? The answer he found was: Only 16% of the region\u2019s white\nregistered voters, but 64% of the black ones. See App. 321\u2013322.\nAnsolabehere next controlled for party registration, but discovered\nthat doing so made essentially no difference: For example, only 18%\nof the region\u2019s white Democrats wound up in District 12, whereas\n65% of the black Democrats did. Seeid., at 332. The upshot\nwas that, regardless of party, a black voter was three to four\ntimes more likely than a white voter to cast his ballot within\nDistrict 12\u2019s borders. Seeibid.Those stark disparities led\nAnsolabehere to conclude that \u201crace, and not party,\u201d was \u201cthe\ndominant factor\u201d in District 12\u2019s design.Id., at\n337.[14] His report, as the\nDistrict Court held, thus tended to confirm the plaintiffs\u2019 direct\nevidence of racial predominance. See 159 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at\n620\u2013621.The District Court\u2019s assessment that all this\nevidence proved racial predominance clears the bar of clear error\nreview. The court emphasized that the districting plan\u2019s own\narchitects had repeatedly described the influx of African-Americans\ninto District 12 as a \u00a75 compliance measure, not a side-effect of\npolitical gerrymandering. And those contemporaneous descriptions\ncomported with the court\u2019s credibility determinations about the\ntrial testimony\u2014that Watt told the truth when he recounted Rucho\u2019s\nresolve to hit a majority-BVAP target; and conversely that Hofeller\nskirted the truth (especially as to Guilford County) when he\nclaimed to have followed only race-blind criteria in drawing\ndistrict lines. We cannot disrespect such credibility judgments.\nSeeAnderson, 470 U.\u00a0S., at 575 (A choice to believe\n\u201cone of two or more witnesses, each of whom has told a coherent and\nfacially plausible story that is not contradicted by extrinsic\nevidence,\u201d can \u201cvirtually never be clear error\u201d).And more\ngenerally, we will not take it upon ourselves to weigh the trial\nevidence as if we were the first to hear it. Seeid.,at 573\n(A \u201creviewing court oversteps\u201d under Rule 52(a) \u201cif it undertakes\nto duplicate the role of the lower court\u201d). No doubt other\ninterpretations of that evidence were permissible. Maybe we would\nhave evaluated the testimony differently had we presided over the\ntrial; or then again, maybe we would not have. Either way\u2014and it is\nonlythiswhich matters\u2014we are far from having a \u201cdefinite\nand firm conviction\u201d that the District Court made a mistake in\nconcluding from the record before it that racial considerations\npredominated in District 12\u2019s design.BThe State mounts a final, legal rather than\nfactual, attack on the District Court\u2019s finding of racial\npredominance. When race and politics are competing explanations of\na district\u2019s lines, argues North Carolina, the party challenging\nthe district must introduce a particular kind of circumstantial\nevidence: \u201can alternative [map] that achieves the legislature\u2019s\npolitical objectives while improving racial balance.\u201d Brief for\nAppellants 31 (emphasis deleted). That is true, the State says,\nirrespective of what other evidence is in the case\u2014so even if the\nplaintiff offers powerful direct proof that the legislature adopted\nthe map it did for racial reasons. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 8. Because\nthe plaintiffs here (as all agree) did not present such a\ncounter-map, North Carolina concludes that they cannot prevail. The\ndissent echoes that argument. Seepost, at 6\u201311.We have no doubt that an alternative districting\nplan, of the kind North Carolina describes, can serve as key\nevidence in a race-versus-politics dispute. One, often highly\npersuasive way to disprove a State\u2019s contention that politics drove\na district\u2019s lines is to show that the legislature had the capacity\nto accomplish all its partisan goals without moving so many members\nof a minority group into the district. If you werereallysorting by political behavior instead of skin color (so the\nargument goes) you would have done\u2014or, at least, could just as well\nhave done\u2014this. Such would-have, could-have, and (to round\nout the set) should-have arguments are a familiar means of\nundermining a claim that an action was based on a permissible,\nrather than a prohibited, ground. See,e.g.,Miller-Elv.Dretke, 545 U.\u00a0S. 231, 249 (2005)\n(\u201cIf that were the [real] explanation for striking [juror]\nWarren[,] the prosecutors should have struck [juror] Jenkins\u201d\ntoo).But they are hardly theonlymeans.\nSuppose that the plaintiff in a dispute like this one introduced\nscores of leaked emails from state officials instructing their\nmapmaker to pack as many black voters as possible into a district,\nor telling him to make sure its BVAP hit 75%. Based on such\nevidence, a court could find that racial rather than political\nfactors predominated in a district\u2019s design, with or without an\nalternative map. And so too in cases lacking that kind of smoking\ngun, as long as the evidence offered satisfies the plaintiff\u2019s\nburden of proof. InBushv.Vera, for example, this\nCourt upheld a finding of racial predominance based on \u201csubstantial\ndirect evidence of the legislature\u2019s racial motivations\u201d\u2014including\ncredible testimony from political figures and statements made in a\n\u00a75 preclearance submission\u2014plus circumstantial evidence that\nredistricters had access to racial, but not political, data at the\n\u201cblock-by-block level\u201d needed to explain their \u201cintricate\u201d designs.\nSee 517 U.\u00a0S., at 960\u2013963 (plurality opinion). Not a single\nMember of the Court thought that the absence of a counter-map made\nany difference. Similarly, it does not matter in this case, where\nthe plaintiffs\u2019 introduction of mostly direct and some\ncircumstantial evidence\u2014documents issued in the redistricting\nprocess, testimony of government officials, expert analysis of\ndemographic patterns\u2014gave the District Court a sufficient basis,\nsans any map, to resolve the race-or-politics question.A plaintiff\u2019s task, in other words, is simply to\npersuade the trial court\u2014without any special evidentiary\nprerequisite\u2014that race (not politics) was the \u201cpredominant\nconsideration in deciding to place a significant number of voters\nwithin or without a particular district.\u201dAlabama, 575\nU.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 4) (internal quotation marks\nomitted); cf.Bethune-Hill, 580 U.\u00a0S., at ___, ___\n(slip op., at 8, 10) (rejecting a similar effort to elevate one\nform of \u201cpersuasive circumstantial evidence\u201d in a dispute\nrespecting racial predominance to a \u201cmandatory precondition\u201d or\n\u201cthreshold requirement\u201d of proof). That burden of proof, we have\noften held, is \u201cdemanding.\u201dE.g., Cromartie II, 532\nU.\u00a0S., at 241. And because that is so, a plaintiff will\nsometimes need an alternative map, as a practical matter, to make\nhis case. But in no area of our equal protection law have we forced\nplaintiffs to submit one particular form of proof to prevail. SeeArlington Heightsv.Metropolitan Housing Development\nCorp., 429 U.\u00a0S. 252 \u2013268 (1977) (offering a varied and\nnon-exhaustive list of \u201csubjects of proper inquiry in determining\nwhether racially discriminatory intent existed\u201d). Nor would it make\nsense to do so here. The Equal Protection Clause prohibits the\nunjustified drawing of district lines based on race. An alternative\nmap is merely an evidentiary tool to show that such a substantive\nviolation has occurred; neither its presence nor its absence can\nitself resolve a racial gerrymandering claim.[15]North Carolina insists, however, that we have\nalready said to the contrary\u2014more particularly, that our decision\ninCromartie IIimposed a non-negotiable \u201calternative-map\nrequirement.\u201d Brief for Appellants 31. As the State observes,Cromartie IIreversed as clearly erroneous a trial court\u2019s\nfinding that race, rather than politics, predominated in the\nassignment of voters to an earlier incarnation of District 12. See\n532 U.\u00a0S., at 241;supra,at 5. And as the State\nemphasizes, a part of our opinion faulted theCromartieplaintiffs for failing to offer a convincing account of how the\nlegislature could have accomplished its political goals other than\nthrough the map it chose. See 532 U.\u00a0S., at 257\u2013258. We there\nstated:\u201cIn a case such as this one where\nmajority-minority districts .\u00a0.\u00a0. are at issue and where\nracial identification correlates highly with political affiliation,\nthe party attacking the legislatively drawn boundaries must show at\nthe least that the legislature could have achieved its legitimate\npolitical objectives in alternative ways that are comparably\nconsistent with traditional districting principles. That party must\nalso show that those districting alternatives would have brought\nabout significantly greater racial balance.\u201dId., at\n258.According to North Carolina, that passage alone\nsettles this case, because it makes an alternative map \u201cessential\u201d\nto a finding that District 12 (a majority-minority district in\nwhich race and partisanship are correlated) was a racial\ngerrymander. Reply Brief 11. Once again, the dissent says the same.\nSeepost, at 7.But the reasoning ofCromartie IIbelies\nthat reading. The Court\u2019s opinion nowhere attempts to explicate or\njustify the categorical rule that the State claims to find there.\n(Certainly the dissent\u2019s current defense of that rule, seepost, at 8\u201311, was nowhere in evidence.) And given the\nstrangeness of that rule\u2014which would treat a mere form of evidence\nas the very substance of a constitutional claim, seesupra,at 29\u201331\u2014we cannot think that the Court adopted it without any\nexplanation. Still more, the entire thrust of theCromartie\nIIopinion runs counter to an inflexible counter-map\nrequirement. If the Court had adopted that rule, it would have had\nno need to weigh each piece of evidence in the case and determine\nwhether, taken together, they were \u201cadequate\u201d to show \u201cthe\npredominance of race in the legislature\u2019s line-drawing process.\u201d\n532 U. S., at 243\u2013244. But that is exactly whatCromartie IIdid, over a span of 20 pages and in exhaustive detail. Item by\nitem, the Court discussed and dismantled the supposed proof, both\ndirect and circumstantial, of race-based redistricting. All that\ncareful analysis would have been superfluous\u2014that dogged effort\nwasted\u2014if the Court viewed the absence or inadequacy of a single\nform of evidence as necessarily dooming a gerrymandering claim.Rightly understood, the passage fromCromartie IIhad a different and narrower point, arising\nfrom and reflecting the evidence offered in that case. The direct\nevidence of a racial gerrymander, we thought, was extremely weak:\nWe said of one piece that it \u201csays little or nothing about whether\nrace played a predominant role\u201d in drawing district lines; we said\nof another that it \u201cis less persuasive than the kinds of direct\nevidence we have found significant in other redistricting cases.\u201dId., at 253\u2013254 (emphasis deleted). Nor did the report of\nthe plaintiffs\u2019 expert impress us overmuch: In our view, it\n\u201coffer[ed] little insight into the legislature\u2019s true motive.\u201dId., at 248. That left a set of arguments of the\nwould-have-could-have variety. For example, the plaintiffs offered\nseveral maps purporting to \u201cshow how the legislature might have\nswapped\u201d some mostly black and mostly white precincts to obtain\ngreater racial balance \u201cwithout harming [the legislature\u2019s]\npolitical objective.\u201dId., at 255 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). But the Court determined that none of those proposed\nexchanges would have worked as advertised\u2014essentially, that the\nplaintiffs\u2019 \u201cyou could have redistricted differently\u201d arguments\nfailed on their own terms. Seeid., at 254\u2013257. Hence\nemerged the demand quoted above, for maps that wouldactuallyshow what the plaintiffs\u2019 had not. In a case likeCromartie II\u2014that is, one in which the plaintiffs had meager\ndirect evidence of a racial gerrymander and needed to rely on\nevidence of forgone alternatives\u2014only maps of that kind could carry\nthe day.Id., at 258.But this case is most unlikeCromartie\nII, even though it involves the same electoral district some\ntwenty years on. This case turned not on the possibility of\ncreating more optimally constructed districts, but on direct\nevidence of the General Assembly\u2019s intent in creating the actual\nDistrict 12, including many hours of trial testimony subject to\ncredibility determinations. That evidence, the District Court\nplausibly found, itself satisfied the plaintiffs\u2019 burden of\ndebunking North Carolina\u2019s \u201cit was really politics\u201d defense; there\nwas no need for an alternative map to do the same job. And we pay\nour precedents no respect when we extend them far beyond the\ncircumstances for which they were designed.VApplying a clear error standard, we uphold the\nDistrict Court\u2019s conclusions that racial considerations\npredominated in designing both District 1 and District 12. For\nDistrict 12, that is all we must do, because North Carolina has\nmade no attempt to justify race-based districting there. For\nDistrict 1, we further uphold the District Court\u2019s decision that \u00a72\nof the VRA gave North Carolina no good reason to reshuffle voters\nbecause of their race. We accordingly affirm the judgment of the\nDistrict Court.It is so ordered.Justice Gorsuch took no part in the\nconsideration or decision of this case.Congressional District 1 (Enacted 2011)Congressional District 12 (Enacted 2011)Notes1A plaintiff succeeds at\nthis stage even if the evidence reveals that a legislature elevated\nrace to the predominant criterion in order to advance other goals,\nincluding political ones. SeeBushv.Vera, 517\nU.\u00a0S. 952 \u2013970 (1996) (plurality opinion) (holding that race\npredominated when a legislature deliberately \u201cspread[\u00a0] the\nBlack population\u201d among several districts in an effort to\n\u201cprotect[\u00a0] Democratic incumbents\u201d);Millerv.Johnson, 515 U.\u00a0S. 900, 914 (1995) (stating that the\n\u201cuse of race as a proxy\u201d for \u201cpolitical interest[s]\u201d is\n\u201cprohibit[ed]\u201d).2Challenges to the\nconstitutionality of congressional districts are heard by\nthree-judge district courts, with a right of direct appeal to this\nCourt. See 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a72284(a), 1253.3The State\u2019s argument to\nthe contrary rests on a legal proposition that was foreclosed\nalmost as soon as it was raised in this Court. According to the\nState, racial considerations cannot predominate in drawing district\nlines unless there is an \u201cactual conflict\u201d between those lines and\n\u201ctraditional districting principles.\u201d Brief for Appellants 45. But\nwe rejected that view earlier this Term, holding that when (as\nhere) race furnished \u201cthe overriding reason for choosing one map\nover others,\u201d a further showing of \u201cinconsistency between the\nenacted plan and traditional redistricting criteria\u201d is unnecessary\nto a finding of racial predominance.Bethune-Hillv.Virginia State Bd. of Elections, 580 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___\n(2017) (slip op., at 10). And in any event, the evidence recounted\nin the text indicates that District 1\u2019s boundariesdidconflict with traditional districting principles\u2014for example, by\nsplitting numerous counties and precincts. Seesupra,at 11.\nSo we would uphold the District Court\u2019s finding of racial\npredominance even under the (incorrect) legal standard the State\nproposes.4In the District Court,\nthe parties also presented arguments relating to the firstGinglesprerequisite, contesting whether the\nAfrican-American community in the region was sufficiently large and\ncompact to form a majority of a reasonably shaped district. The\ncourt chose not to decide that fact-intensive question. And aside\nfrom the State\u2019s unelaborated assertion that \u201c[t]here is no\nquestion that the first factor was satisfied,\u201d Brief for Appellants\n52, the parties have not briefed or argued the issue before us. We\ntherefore have no occasion to address it.5North Carolina calls our\nattention to two expert reports on voting patterns throughout the\nState, but neither casts light on the relevant issue. The first (by\nDr. Thomas Brunell) showed that some elections in many of the\nState\u2019s counties exhibited \u201cstatistically significant\u201d racially\npolarized voting. App. 1001. The second (by Dr. Ray Block) found\nthat in various elections across the State, white voters were\n\u201cnoticeably\u201d less likely than black voters to support black\ncandidates.Id., at 959. From those far-flung data\npoints\u2014themselves based only on past elections\u2014the experts opined\n(to no one\u2019s great surprise) that in North Carolina, as in most\nStates, there are discernible, non-random relationships between\nrace and voting. But as the District Court found, seeHarrisv.McCrory, 159 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d 600, 624 (MDNC 2016), that\ngeneralized conclusion fails to meaningfully (or indeed, at all)\naddress the relevant local question: whether, in a new version of\nDistrict 1 created without a focus on race, black voters would\nencounter \u201csufficient[\u00a0]\u201d white bloc-voting to \u201ccancel [their]\nability to elect representatives of their choice,\u201dGingles,\n478 U.\u00a0S., at 56. And so the reports do not answer whether the\nlegislature needed to boost District 1\u2019s BVAP to avoid potential \u00a72\nliability.6Justice Alito charges us\nwith \u201cignor[ing]\u201d the State\u2019s political-gerrymander defense, making\nour analysis \u201clike Hamlet without the prince.\u201dPost, at 20\n(opinion concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part)\n(hereinafter dissent); seepost, at 20, 34. But we simply\ntake the State\u2019s account for what it is: one side of a thoroughly\ntwo-sided case (and, as we will discuss, the side the District\nCourt rejected, primarily on factual grounds). By contrast, the\ndissent consistently treats the State\u2019s version of events (what it\ncalls \u201cthe Legislature\u2019s political strategy and the relationship\nbetween that strategy and [District 12\u2019s] racial composition,\u201dpost, at 20) as if it were a simple \u201cfact of the matter\u201d\u2014the\npremise of, rather than a contested claim in, this case. Seepost, at 12\u201314, 16, 20, 26, 27\u201329, 33. The dissent\u2019s\nnarrative thus tracks, top-to-bottom and point-for-point, the\ntestimony of Dr. Hofeller, the State\u2019s star witness at trial\u2014so\nmuch so that the dissent could just have block-quoted that portion\nof the transcript and saved itself a fair bit of trouble. Comparepost, at 12\u201320, with App. 2671\u20132755. Imagine (to update the\ndissent\u2019s theatrical reference)Inherit the Windretold\nsolely from the perspective of William Jennings Bryan, with nary a\nthought given to the competing viewpoint of Clarence\nDarrow.7As earlier noted, that\ninquiry is satisfied when legislators have \u201cplace[d] a significant\nnumber of voters within or without\u201d a district predominantly\nbecause of their race, regardless of their ultimate objective in\ntaking that step. Seesupra,at 2, and n.\u00a01. So, for\nexample, if legislators use race as their predominant districting\ncriterion with the end goal of advancing their partisan\ninterests\u2014perhaps thinking that a proposed district is more\n\u201csellable\u201d as a race-based VRA compliance measure than as a\npolitical gerrymander and will accomplish much the same thing\u2014their\naction still triggers strict scrutiny. SeeVera, 517\nU.\u00a0S., at 968\u2013970 (plurality opinion). In other words, the\nsorting of voters on the grounds of their race remains suspect even\nif race is meant to function as a proxy for other (including\npolitical) characteristics. SeeMiller, 515 U.\u00a0S., at\n914.8Undeterred by these\nsettled principles, the dissent undertakes to refind the facts of\nthis case at every turn. Seepost, at 11\u201333. Indeed, the\ndissent repeatedly flips the appropriate standard of\nreview\u2014arguing, for example, that the District Court\u2019s is not \u201cthe\nonly plausible interpretation\u201d of one piece of contested evidence\nand that the State offered an \u201centirely natural\u201d view of another.Post, at 24, 31; see alsopost, at 20, 26, 27, 33.\nUnderlying that approach to the District Court\u2019s factfinding is an\nelemental error: The dissent mistakes the rule that a legislature\u2019s\ngood faith should be presumed \u201cuntil a claimant makes a showing\nsufficient to support th[e] allegation\u201d of \u201crace-based\ndecisionmaking,\u201dMiller, 515 U.\u00a0S., at 915, for a kind\nof super-charged, pro-State presumption on appeal, trumping\nclear-error review. Seepost, at 11\u201312,\nn.\u00a07.9The dissent\u2019s contrary\nreading of the preclearance submission\u2014as reporting the\nredistricters\u2019 \u201cdecis[ion]notto construct District 12 as a\nmajority-minority district,\u201dpost, at 24\u2014is difficult to\nfathom. The language the dissent cites explains only why Rucho and\nLewis rejected one particular way of creating such a district; the\nsubmission then relates their alternative (and, of course,\nsuccessful) approach to attaining an over-50% BVAP. See App.\n478\u2013479.10Watt\nrecalled that he laughed in response because the VRA required no\nsuch target. Seeid., at 2369. And he told Rucho that \u201cthe\nAfrican-American community will laugh at you\u201d too.Ibid.Watt explained to Rucho: \u201cI\u2019m getting 65 percent of the vote in a\n40 percent black district. If you ramp my [BVAP] to over 50\npercent, I\u2019ll probably get 80 percent of the vote, and[\u00a0]\nthat\u2019s not what the Voting Rights Act was designed to do.\u201dIbid.11The\ncourt acknowledged that, in the earlier state-court trial involving\nDistrict 12, Rucho denied making the comments that Watt recalled.\nSee 159 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at 617\u2013618. But the court explained that\nit could not \u201cassess [the] credibility\u201d of Rucho\u2019s contrary account\nbecause even though he was listed as a defense witness and present\nin the courtroom throughout the trial, the State chose not to put\nhim on the witness stand.Id.,at 618.12The\ndissent conjures a different way of explaining Watt\u2019s testi-mony.\nPerhaps, the dissent suggests, Rucho disclosed a majority-minority\ntarget to Watt, but Watt thenchanged Rucho\u2019s mind\u2014and\nperhaps it was just a coincidence (or a mistake?) that Rucho still\ncreated a 50.7%-BVAP district. Seepost, at 25\u201326. But\nnothing in the record supports that hypothesis. Seeibid.(relying exclusively on the State\u2019s preclearance submission to back\nup this story);supra,at 23, and n.\u00a09 (correcting the\ndissent\u2019s misreading of that submission). And the State, lacking\nthe dissent\u2019s creativity, did not think to present it at\ntrial.13The\ndissent charges that this comparison is misleading, but offers no\ngood reason why that is so. Seepost, at 29\u201330. It is quite\ntrue, as the dissent notes, that another part of District 12 (in\nMecklenburg County) experienced a net increase in black voters even\nlarger than the one in Guilford County. Seepost, at 30.\n(The net increases in the two counties thus totaled more than\n35,000; they were then partially offset by net decreases in other\ncounties in District 12.) But that is irrelevant to the point made\nhere: Without the numerous black voters added to District 12 in\nGuilford County\u2014where the evidence most clearly indicates voters\nwere chosen based on race\u2014the district would have fallen well shy\nof majority-minority status.14Hofeller did not dispute\nAnsolabehere\u2019s figures, but questioned his inference. Those\nstriking patterns, the mapmaker claimed, were nothing more than the\nresult of his own reliance on voting data from the 2008\nPresidential election\u2014because that information (i.e.,who\nvoted for Obama and who for McCain) tracked race better than it did\nparty registration. See App. 1101, 1111\u20131114; cf.Cromartie\nII, 532 U.\u00a0S. 234, 245 (2001) (recognizing that \u201cparty\nregistration and party preference do not always correspond\u201d). As we\nhave just recounted, however, the District Court had other reasons\nto disbelieve Hofeller\u2019s testimony that he used solely that\nelectoral data to draw District 12\u2019s lines. Seesupra, at\n25\u201326. And Ansolabehere contended that even if Hofeller did so,\nthat choice of data could itself suggest an intent to sort voters\nby race. Voting results from a \u201csingle [Presidential] election with\na Black candidate,\u201d Ansolabehere explained, would be a \u201cproblematic\nand unusual\u201d indicator of future party preference, because of the\nracial dynamics peculiar to such a match-up. App. 341; seeid., at 342\u2013343. That data would, indeed, be much more\nuseful as a reflection of an area\u2019s racial composition: \u201cThe Obama\nvote,\u201d Ansolabehere found, is \u201can extremely strong positive\nindicator of the location of Black registered voters\u201d and,\nconversely, an \u201cextremely strong negative indicator of the location\nof White registered voters.\u201dId., at 342; seeid., at\n2546\u20132550.15The\ndissent responds that an alternative-map requirement \u201cshould not be\ntoo hard\u201d for plaintiffs (or at least \u201csophisticated\u201d litigants\n\u201clike those in the present case\u201d) to meet.Post, at 10\u201311.\nBut if the plaintiffs have already proved by a preponderance of the\nevidence that race predominated in drawing district lines, then we\nhave no warrant to demand that they jump through additional\nevidentiary hoops (whether the exercise would cost a hundred\ndollars or a million, a week\u2019s more time or a year\u2019s). Or at least\nthat would be so if we followed the usual rules. Underlying the\ndissent\u2019s view that we should not\u2014that we should instead create a\nspecial evidentiary burden\u2014is its belief that \u201clitigation of this\nsort\u201d often seeks to \u201cobtain in court what [a political party]\ncould not achieve in the political arena,\u201dpost, at 9, and\nso that little is lost by making suits like this one as hard as\npossible. But whatever the possible motivations for bringing such\nsuits (and the dissent says it isnotquestioning \u201cwhat\noccurred here,\u201dibid.), they serve to prevent legislatures\nfrom taking unconstitutional districting action\u2014which happens more\noften than the dissent must suppose. State lawmakers sometimes\nmisunderstand the VRA\u2019s requirements (as may have occurred here\nwith respect to \u00a75), leading them to employ race as a predominant\ndistricting criterion when they should not. Seesupra, at\n22\u201324, and n.\u00a010. Or they may resort to race-based districting\nfor ultimately political reasons, leveraging the strong correlation\nbetween race and voting behavior to advance their partisan\ninterests. See nn. 1, 7,supra. Or, finally\u2014though we hope\nless commonly\u2014they may simply seek to suppress the electoral power\nof minority voters. When plaintiffs meet their burden of showing\nthat such conduct has occurred, there is no basis for subjecting\nthem to additional\u2014and unique\u2014evidentiary hurdles, preventing them\nfrom receiving the remedy to which they are entitled.",
