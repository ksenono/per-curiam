Seeante, at 8\u20139. I write separately to note my continued\ndisagreement withAOSI Iand to explain that the Policy\nRequirement does not violate the First Amendment for a far simpler\nreason: It does not compel anyone to say anything.InAOSI I, the Court erred by holding\nthat the Policy Requirement violated respondents\u2019 First Amendment\nrights by conditioning their receipt of Leadership Act[1] funds on the affirmation of certain\nprogram objectives. \u201cThe First Amendment does not mandate a\nviewpoint-neutral government.\u201dAOSI I, 570 U.\u00a0S., at\n221 (Scalia, J., joined by Thomas, J., dissenting). Thus, the\nGovernment may require those who seek to carry out federally funded\nprograms to support the Government\u2019s objectives with regard to\nthose programs.Ibid.After all, the Constitution itself\n\u201cimpos[es] affirmative ideological commitments prerequisite to\nassisting in the government\u2019s work.\u201dId., at 227. It\nexcludes viewpoints such as communism and anarchism, stating that\nthose engaged in government work must swear an oath to support our\nConstitution\u2019s republican form of government. See Art. VI,\ncl.\u00a03.Moreover, the mere conditioning of funds on\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018the affirmation of a belief\u2019\u00a0\u201d tied to the purpose of\na government program involves \u201cno compulsion at all.\u201dAOSI\nI, 570 U.\u00a0S., at 226 (Scalia, J., joined by Thomas, J.,\ndissenting). Such a condition is \u201cthe reasonable price of admission\nto a limited government-spending program that each organization\nremains free to accept or reject.\u201dIbid.Just as respondents\nare not compelled to associate with their foreign affiliates, seeante, at 6\u20138, they are not compelled to participate in the\nLeadership Act program.The Policy Requirement does not violate the\nFirst Amendment, regardless of whether it is applied to\nrespondents, respondents\u2019 legally distinct foreign affiliates, or\nany other organization, foreign or domestic. Because the Court\nproperly rejects respondents\u2019 attempt to extend our erroneous\nprecedent, I join its opinion in full.Notes1As the Court explains,\nthe United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and\nMalaria Act of 2003 (Leadership Act), 22 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a77601et\u00a0seq., \u201callocate[s] billions of dollars to American\nand foreign nongovernmental organizations that combat HIV/AIDS\nabroad.\u201dAnte,at 1.",
