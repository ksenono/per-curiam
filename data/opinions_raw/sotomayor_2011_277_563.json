S. ____ (2011)SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESNO. 08-1438HARVEY LEROY SOSSAMON, III, PETITIONERv.TEXAS et\u00a0al.on writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the fifth circuit[April 20, 2011]Justice Sotomayor, with whom\nJustice Breyer joins, dissenting.The Court holds that the term\n\u201cappropriate relief\u201d is too ambiguous to provide States with clear\nnotice that they will be liable for monetary damages under the\nReligious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000\n(RLUIPA), 114 Stat. 803, 42 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a72000ccet seq.\nI dis-agree. No one disputes that, in accepting federal funds, the\nStates consent to suit for violations of RLUIPA\u2019s substantive\nprovisions; the only question is what relief is available to\nplaintiffs asserting injury from such violations. That monetary\ndamages are \u201cappropriate relief\u201d is, in my view, self-evident.\nUnder general remedies principles, the usual remedy for a violation\nof a legal right is damages. Consistent with these principles, our\nprecedents make clear that the phrase \u201cappropriate relief\u201d includes\nmonetary relief. By adopting a contrary reading of the term, the\nmajority severely undermines the \u201cbroad protection of religious\nexercise\u201d Congress intended the statute to provide. \u00a72000cc\u20133(g).\nFor these reasons, I respectfully dissent.IAAs the Court acknowledges, the\nproposition that \u201cStates may waive their sovereign immunity\u201d is an\n\u201cunremarkable\u201d one.Seminole Tribe of Fla.v.Florida,517\nU. S. 44, 65 (1996); see alsoAldenv.Maine,527 U. S. 706,\n737 (1999) (\u201c[W]e have not questioned the general proposition that\na State may waive its sovereign immunity and consent to suit\u201d);Atascadero State Hospitalv.Scanlon,473 U. S. 234, 238\n(1985) (noting the \u201cwell-established\u201d prin-ciple that \u201cif a State\nwaives its immunity and consents to suit in federal court, the\nEleventh Amendment does not bar the action\u201d);Pettyv.Tennessee-Missouri Bridge Comm\u2019n,359 U. S. 275, 276\n(1959) (noting that a State may waive sovereign immunity \u201cat its\npleasure\u201d).Neither the majority nor\nrespondents (hereinafter Texas) dispute that, pursuant to its power\nunder the Spending Clause, U. S. Const., Art.\u00a0I, \u00a78,\ncl.\u00a01, Congress may secure a State\u2019s consent to suit as a\ncondition of the State\u2019s receipt of federal funding.[Footnote 1] SeeCollege Savings\nBankv.Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense\nBd.,527 U. S.\n666, 686 (1999) (\u201cCongress may, in the exercise of its spending\npower, condition its grant of funds to the States upon their taking\ncertain actions that Congress could not require them to take, and \u2026\nacceptance of the funds entails an agreement to the actions\u201d);Atascadero, 473 U. S., at 247 (suggesting that a federal\nstatute can \u201ccondition participation in the programs funded under\nthe [statute] on a State\u2019s consent to waive its constitutional\nimmunity\u201d). As with all waivers of sovereign immunity, the question\nis whether the State has unequivocally consented to suit in federal\ncourt. SeeCollege Savings Bank, 527 U. S., at 680;Atascadero, 473 U. S., at 238, n.\u00a01.Thus, in order to attach a waiver of sovereign\nimmunity to federal funds, Congress \u201cmust do so unambiguously,\u201d so\nas to \u201cenable the States to exercise their choice knowingly.\u201dPennhurst State School and Hospitalv.Halderman,451 U. S. 1, 17\n(1981). In other words, the State must have notice of the condition\nit is accepting. SeeArlington Central School Dist. Bd. of\nEd.v.Murphy,548 U. S. 291, 298\n(2006) (\u201c[C]lear notice \u2026 is required under the Spending Clause\u201d).\nThe reason for requiring notice is simple: \u201cStates cannot knowingly\naccept conditions of which they are \u2018unaware\u2019 or which they are\n\u2018unable to ascertain.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId., at 296 (quotingPennhurst, 451 U. S., at 17). In assessing whether a\nfederal statute provides clear notice of the conditions attached,\n\u201cwe must view the [statute] from the perspective of a state\nofficial who is engaged in the process of deciding whether the\nState should accept [federal] funds and the obligations that go\nwith those funds.\u201dArlington Central, 548 U. S., at\n296.There is also no dispute that RLUIPA clearly\nconditions a State\u2019s receipt of federal funding on its consent to\nsuit for violations of the statute\u2019s substantive provisions. The\nstatute states that \u201cprogram[s] or activit[ies] that receiv[e]\nFederal financial assistance\u201d may not impose a \u201csubstantial burden\non the religious exercise of a person residing in or confined to an\ninstitution.\u201d \u00a72000cc\u20131. When such a burden has been imposed, the\nvictim \u201cmay assert a violation of [RLUIPA] as a claim \u2026 in a\njudicial proceeding and obtain appropriate relief against a\ngovernment,\u201d \u00a72000cc\u20132(a), which the statute defines, as relevant,\nas \u201ca State, county, municipality, or other governmental entity\ncreated under the authority of a State,\u201d \u00a72000cc\u20135(4)(A)(i).\nAccordingly, it is evident that Texas had notice that, in accepting\nfederal funds, it waived its sovereign immunity to suit by\ninstitutionalized persons upon whom it has imposed an unlawful\nsubstantial burden. SeeMadisonv.Virginia, 474\nF.\u00a03d 118, 130 (CA4 2006) (\u201cOn its face, RLUIPA \u2026 creates a\nprivate cause of action against the State, and Virginia cannot be\nheard to claim that it was unaware of this condition\u201d (citations\nomitted));Benningv.Georgia, 391 F.\u00a03d\n1299, 1305 (CA11 2004) (\u201cCongress unambiguously required states to\nwaive their sovereign immunity from suits filed by prisoners to\nenforce RLUIPA\u201d).BThe Court holds that the phrase\n\u201cappropriate relief\u201d does not provide state officials clear notice\nthatmonetary reliefwill be available against the States,\nmeaning that they could not have waived their immunity with respect\nto that particular type of liability. This holding is contrary to\ngeneral remedies principles and our precedents.RLUIPA straightforwardly provides\na private right of action to \u201cobtain appropriate relief against a\ngovernment.\u201d \u00a72000cc\u20132(a). Under \u201cour traditional approach to\ndeciding what remedies are available for violation of a federal\nright,\u201d damages are the default\u2014and equitable relief the\nexception\u2014for \u201cit is axiomatic that a court should determine the\nadequacy of a remedy in law before resorting to equitable relief.\u201dFranklinv.Gwinnett County Public Schools,503 U. S. 60,\n75\u201376 (1992); see alsoWeinbergerv.Romero-Barcelo,456 U. S. 305, 312\n(1982) (\u201cThe Court has repeatedly held that the basis for\ninjunctive relief in the federal courts has always been \u2026 the\ninadequacy of legal remedies\u201d);Bivensv.Six Unknown\nFed. Narcotics Agents,403 U. S. 388, 395\n(1971) (\u201cHistorically, damages have been regarded as the ordinary\nremedy for an invasion of personal interests in liberty\u201d); cf.Monsanto Co.v.Geertson Seed Farms, 561 U. S.\n___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 24) (\u201cAn injunction is a drastic and\nextraordinary remedy, which should not be granted as a matter of\ncourse\u201d). It is unsurprising, therefore, that on more than one\noccasion Congress has felt it necessary to clarify in the text of a\nstatute that it meant the terms \u201crelief\u201d and \u201cappropriate relief\u201d\ntoexcludedamages. See 5 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7702 (providing\nthat, under the Administrative Procedure Act, \u201crelief other than\nmoney damages\u201d is available against a federal agency to remedy a\n\u201clegal wrong\u201d); see also 42 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a76395(e)(1) (providing a\ncause of action for \u201cappropriate relief,\u201d but specifying that\n\u201c[n]othing in this subsection shall authorize any person to recover\ndamages\u201d); 15 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7797(b)(5) (similar).If, despite the clarity of this background\nprinciple, state officials reading RLUIPA were somehow still\nuncertain as to whether the phrase \u201cappropriate relief\u201d encompasses\nmonetary damages, our precedents would relieve any doubt. InFranklinwe made clear that, \u201cabsent clear direction to\nthe contrary by Congress,\u201d federal statutes providing a private\nright of action authorize all \u201cappropriate relief,\u201d including\ndamages, against violators of its substantive terms. 503 U. S., at\n70\u201371, 75\u201376. We reiterated this principle inBarnesv.Gorman,536\nU. S. 181, 185, 187 (2002), affirming that \u201cthe scope of\n\u2018appropriate relief\u2019\u00a0\u201d includes compensatory damages.[Footnote 2] The holdings in these cases\nare fully consistent with the general principle that monetary\nrelief is available for violations of the substantive conditions\nCongress attaches, through Spending Clause legislation, to the\nacceptance of federal funding. SeeDavisv.Monroe\nCounty Bd. of Ed.,526 U. S. 629, 640\n(1999) (\u201c[P]ursuant to Congress\u2019 authority under the Spending\nClause \u2026 private damages actions are available\u201d);Gebserv.Lago Vista Independent School Dist.,524 U. S. 274, 287\n(1998) (noting that \u201c[w]hen Congress attaches conditions to the\naward of federal funds under its spending power \u2026 private actions\nholding the recipient liable in monetary damages\u201d are permissible).\nIt would be an odd derogation of the normal rules of statutory\nconstruction for state officials reading RLUIPA to assume that\nCongress drafted the statute in ignorance of these unambiguous\nprecedents. SeeMerck & Co.v.Reynolds, 559\nU. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 12) (\u201cWe normally assume that,\nwhen Congress enacts statutes, it is aware of relevant judicial\nprecedent\u201d).[Footnote 3]CAccordingly, it is difficult to\nunderstand the basis for the Court\u2019s position that the phrase\n\u201cappropriate relief\u201d in \u00a72000cc\u20132(a) fails to provide state\nofficials with clear notice that waiving sovereign immunity to\nmonetary relief is a condition of accepting federal funds. In\narguing that \u201ca waiver of sovereign immunityto other types of\nreliefdoes not waive immunity to damages,\u201dante, at\n6 (emphasis added), the majority appears to accept that equitable\nrelief is available to RLUIPA plaintiffs. SeeMadison, 474\nF.\u00a03d, at 131 (holding that a RLUIPA plaintiff\u2019s \u201cclaims for\nequitable relief are not barred by the Eleventh Amendment\u201d); cf.\n560 F.\u00a03d 316, 331, 336 (CA5 2009) (reversing the District\nCourt\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Texas on one of petitioner\u2019s\nRLUIPA claims for declaratory and injunctive relief). The\nexplanation for the majority\u2019s implicit acceptance of suits for\ninjunctive and declaratory relief is obvious enough: It would be a\nparticularly curious reading of the statute to conclude that\nCongress\u2019 express provision of a private right of action to seek\n\u201cappropriate relief\u201d against \u201ca State\u201d nonetheless left plaintiffs\nsuing for state violations of RLUIPA withnoavailable\nrelief.It is not apparent, however, why\nthe phrase \u201cappropriate relief\u201d is too ambiguous to secure a waiver\nof state sovereign immunity with respect to damages but is clear\nenough as to injunctive and other forms of equitable relief. The\nmajority appears to believe that equitable relief is a \u201csuitable\u201d\nor \u201cproper\u201d remedy for a state violation of RLUIPA\u2019s substantive\nprovisions but monetary relief is not; therefore, a state official\nreading the \u201copen-ended and ambiguous\u201d phrase \u201cappropriate relief\u201d\nwill be unaware that it includes damages but fully apprised that it\nmakes equitable relief available. Seeante, at 6\u20137. But\nsovereign immunity is not simply a defense against certain classes\nof remedies\u2014it is a defense against being sued at all. See,e.g.,Federal Maritime Comm\u2019nv.South\nCarolina Ports Authority,535 U. S. 743, 766\n(2002). As a result, there is no inherent reason why the phrase\n\u201cappropriate relief\u201d would provide adequate notice as to equitable\nremedies but not as to monetary ones. In fact, as discussed\nearlier, in light of general remedies principles the presumption\narguably should be the reverse. Seesupra, at 4\u20136.The majority suggests that equitable relief is\nthe sole \u201cappropriate relief\u201d for statutory violations \u201cwhere the\ndefendant is a sovereign.\u201dAnte, at 6\u20137. There can be\nlittle doubt, however, that the \u201cappropriateness\u201d of relief to be\nafforded a civil plaintiff is generally determined by the nature of\nthe injury to his legal rights. SeeFranklin, 503 U. S.,\nat 76 (concluding that monetary damages were \u201cappropriate\u201d because\nequitable relief offered no redress for the injury suffered); see\nalsoMillikenv.Bradley,433 U. S. 267, 280\n(1977) (\u201c[T]he nature of the \u2026 remedy is to be determined by the\nnature and scope of the \u2026 violation\u201d);Bellv.Hood,327\nU. S. 678, 684 (1946) (\u201c[W]here federally protected rights have\nbeen invaded, it has been the rule from the beginning that courts\nwill be alert to adjust their remedies so as to grant the necessary\nrelief\u201d). In support of its proposition the majority cites only to\na case in which we expresslyrejectedthe argument that\nstate sovereign immunity operates differently according to what\ntype of relief is sought. SeeFederal Maritime, 535 U. S.,\nat 765 (\u201c[S]overeign immunity applies regardless of whether a\nprivate plaintiff\u2019s suit is for monetary damages or some other type\nof relief\u201d); cf.id., at 769 (\u201c[T]he primary function of\nsovereign immunity is not to protect state treasuries, but to\nafford the States the dignity and respect due sovereign entities\u201d\n(citation omitted)). Nor is the basis for the majority\u2019s view\napparent from the other cases that it cites.[Footnote 4]The majority\u2019s additional arguments in support\nof its holding also fail to persuade. The majority contends that\nthe use of a \u201ccontext-dependent\u201d word like \u201cappropriate\u201d\nnecessarily renders the provision ambiguous.Ante, at 7.\nBut the fact that the precise relief afforded by a court may vary\ndepending on the particular injury to be addressed in a given case\ndoes not render \u00a72000cc\u20132(a) ambiguous; it simply means that\nCongress meant for that provision to be comprehensive. SeePennsylvania Dept. of Correctionsv.Yeskey,524 U. S. 206,\n212 (1998) (\u201c[T]he fact that a statute can be applied in situations\nnot expressly anti-cipated by Congress does not demonstrate\nambiguity. It demonstrates breadth\u201d (internal quotation marks\nomitted)); cf.Westv.Gibson,527 U. S. 212, 217\u2013218 (1999) (holding\nthat the phrase \u201cappropriate remedies\u201d in 42 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a72000e\u201316(b) includes remedies not expressly enumerated).Next, the majority repeats Texas\u2019s\ndictionary-based contention that in using the word \u201crelief\u201d\nCongress meant to \u201cconnot[e] equitable relief.\u201dAnte, at\n8. This proposition suffers from three flaws. First, it is not\nestablished by the dictionary to which the majority cites. See\nBlack\u2019s Law Dictionary 1293 (7th ed. 1999) (\u201crelief: \u2026 Also termedremedy\u201d);id., at 1296 (\u201cremedy: \u2026 The means of\nenforcing a right or preventing or redressing a wrong;legal or\nequitable relief\u201d(emphasis added)). Second, it is\ninconsistent with our precedent. SeeBarnes, 536 U. S., at\n185\u2013187 (noting that \u201cappropriate relief\u201d includes monetary and\ninjunctive relief). Third, it is undermined by the fact that, on\nnumerous occasions, Congress has deemed it necessary to specify\nthat \u201crelief\u201dincludesinjunctive and other equitable\nrelief. See 16 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7973i(e) (authorizing the Attorney\nGeneral to \u201ccommence a civil action for appropriate relief,\nincluding permanent or tempo- rary injunction\u201d); see also 2 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a7437g(a)(6)(A); 8 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71324a(f)(2); 12 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a71715z\u20134a(b); 15 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a76309(a). If the term\n\u201crelief\u201d already connotes equitable relief\u2014andonlyequitable relief\u2014additional explication is redundant.Finally, the majority asserts that because the\nparties to this case advance opposing \u201cplausible arguments\u201d\nregarding the correct interpretation of RLUIPA\u2019s text, we must\nconclude that the statute is ambiguous.Ante, at 8\u20139. This\nview of how we adjudicate cases is incorrect as a descriptive\nmatter. See,e.g.,Carcieriv.Salazar,555 U. S. 379,\n390 (2009) (reviewing the parties\u2019 conflicting textual\ninterpretations of a statute but concluding that it was unambiguous\nnonetheless). Moreover, I cannot agree with the majority that our\ncapacity to interpret authoritatively the text of a federal statute\nis held hostage to the litigants\u2019 strategic arguments. If this were\ntrue, there would be few cases in which we would be able to decide\nthat a statute was unambiguous.In sum, the majority\u2019s conclusion that States\naccepting federal funds have not consented to suit for monetary\nrelief cannot be reconciled with the fact that the availability of\nsuch relief is evident in light of RLUIPA\u2019s plain terms and the\nprinciples animating our relevant precedents. In so holding, the\nmajority discovers ambiguity where none is to be found.IIThere is another reason to\nquestion the soundness of today\u2019s decision. The Court\u2019s reading of\n\u00a72000cc\u20132(a) severely undermines Congress\u2019 unmistakably stated\nintent in passing the statute: to afford \u201cbroad protection of\nreligious exercise, to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of\n[the statute] and the Constitution.\u201d \u00a72000cc\u20133(g). I find it\nimprobable that, in light of this express statutory purpose and the\nhistory of \u201clong-running congressional efforts to accord religious\nexercise heightened protection from government-imposed burdens,\u201dCutterv.Wilkinson,544 U. S. 709, 714\n(2005), state officials would read RLUIPA\u2019s relief provision in the\nsame limited manner the majority does.[Footnote 5]As the majority acknowledges,\nRLUIPA was Congress\u2019 second attempt to guarantee by statute the\n\u201cbroad protection\u201d of religious exercise that we found to be\nunwarranted as a constitutional matter inEmployment Div.,\nDept. of Human Resources of Ore.v.Smith,494 U. S. 872(1990). As\nwe have previously recognized, in passing RLUIPA Congress was\nclearly concerned that state institutions regularly imposed\n\u201cfrivolous or arbitrary barriers imped[ing] institutionalized\npersons\u2019 religious exercise.\u201dCutter, 544 U. S., at 716\n(internal quotation marks omitted); see also 146 Cong. Rec. 16698,\n16699 (2000) (joint statement of Sen. Hatch and Sen. Kennedy on\nRLUIPA) (\u201cWhether from indifference, ignorance, bigotry, or lack of\nresources, some institutions restrict religious liberty in\negregious and unnecessary ways\u201d);ibid.(\u201cInstitutional\nresidents\u2019 rights to practice their faith is at the mercy of those\nrunning the institution \u2026\u201d). It is difficult to believe that\nCongress would have devoted such care and effort to establishing\nsignificant statutory protections for religious exercise and\nspecifically extended those protections to persons in state\ninstitutions, yet withheld from plaintiffs a crucial tool for\nsecuring the rights the statute guarantees.By depriving prisoners of a damages remedy for\nviolations of their statutory rights, the majority ensures that\nplaintiffs suing state defendants under RLUIPA will be forced to\nseek enforcement of those rights with one hand tied behind their\nbacks. Most obviously, the majority\u2019s categorical denial of\nmonetary relief means that a plaintiff who prevails on the merits\nof his claim that a State has substantially burdened his religious\nexercise will often be denied redress for the injury he has\nsuffered, because in many instances \u201cprospective relief accords \u2026\nno remedy at all.\u201dFranklin, 503 U. S., at 76; see\nH.\u00a0R. Rep. No. 102\u201340, pt. 2, p.\u00a025 (1991) (Report of\nCommittee on the Judiciary on the Civil Rights Act of 1991) (\u201cThe\nlimitation of relief under Title VII to equitable remedies often\nmeans that victims \u2026 may not recover for the very real effects of\nthe [statutory violation]\u201d). Injunctive relief from a federal court\nmay address a violation going forward, but this fact will be of\ncold comfort to the victims of serious, non-recurring violations\nfor which equitable relief may be inappropriate.In addition, the unavailability of monetary\nrelief will effectively shield unlawful policies and practices from\njudicial review in many cases. Under state law, discretion to\ntransfer prisoners \u201cin a wide variety of circumstances is vested in\nprison officials.\u201dMeachumv.Fano,427 U. S. 215, 227\n(1976). A number of RLUIPA suits seeking injunctive relief have\nbeen dismissed as moot because the plaintiff was transferred from\nthe institution where the alleged violation took place prior to\nadjudication on the merits. See,e.g.,Colvinv.Caruso, 605 F.\u00a03d 282, 287, 289 (CA6 2010);Simmonsv.Herrera, No. C 09\u20130318 JSW (PR), 2010\nWL 1233815, *3 (ND Cal., Mar. 26, 2010); see generally Brief for\nAmerican Civil Liberties Union et\u00a0al. asAmici Curiae8\u201311. Absent a damages remedy, longstanding RLUIPA challenges may\nwell be dismissed for lack of a case or controversy conferring\nArticle III jurisdiction on the federal court. Cf.Moussazadehv.Texas Dept. of Crim. Justice, Civ.\nAction No. G\u201307\u2013574, 2009 WL 819497, *9 (SD Tex., Mar. 26, 2009)\n(dismissing as moot plaintiff\u2019s RLUIPA claim because he had been\ntransferred to a facility that provided kosher food), remanded, 364\nFed. Appx. 110 (CA5 2010); Opening Brief for Plaintiff-Appellant inMoussazadehv.Texas Dept. of Crim. Justice, No.\n09\u201340400 (CA5), p.\u00a011 (noting that transfer to a special\nfacility took place 19 months after the plaintiff filed suit and\njust before discovery\u2014which had been stayed 12 months for\nnegotiation\u2014was scheduled to recommence). Or, as happened in this\ncase, officials may change the policy while litigation is pending.\nThe fact of \u201cvoluntary cessation\u201d may allow some of these claims to\ngo forward, but many will nonetheless be dismissed as moot (as\nhappened in this case).[Footnote\n6]Of course, under the rule the majority\nannounces, Congress can revise RLUIPA to provide specifically for\nmonetary relief against the States, perhaps by inserting the phrase\n\u201cincluding monetary relief\u201d into the text of \u00a72000cc\u20132(a). But we\nhave never demanded that a waiver be presented in a particular\nformulation to be effective; we only require that it be clear. See,e.g.,Edelmanv.Jordan,415 U. S. 651, 673\n(1974) (holding that waiver may be found in \u201cexpress language\u201d or\nby \u201coverwhelming implications from the text\u201d (internal quotation\nmarks omitted)). In holding to the contrary, the majority erects a\nformalistic barrier to the vindication of statutory rights\ndeliberately provided for by Congress.More problematically, because there is no\napparent reason why the term \u201cappropriate relief\u201d is sufficiently\nclear as to equitable relief but not as to monetary relief, we are\nleft with the very real possibility that, in order to secure a\nwaiver of immunity under the majority\u2019s new rule, Congress must now\nitemize in the statutory text every type of relief meant to be\navailable against sovereign defendants. I, for one, do not relish\nthe prospect of federal courts being presented with endless state\nchallenges to all manner of federal statutes, on the ground that\nCongress failed to predict that a laundry list of terms must be\nincluded to waive sovereign immunity to all forms of relief. I\nwould avoid the problems the majority\u2019s decision invites and hold\ninstead that, as is the case here, when a general statutory term\nlike \u201cappropriate relief\u201d is used, clear no-tice has been provided\nand a State\u2019s acceptance of federal funds constitutes a waiver of\nsovereign immunity to all relief, equitable and monetary.As explained above, nothing in our precedent\ndemands the result the majority reaches today. The conclusion that\nRLUIPA fails to provide States with sufficient notice that they are\nliable for monetary relief cannot be squared with the\nstraightforward terms of the statute and the general principles\nevident in our prior cases. For these reasons, and because the\nmajority\u2019s decision significantly undermines Congress\u2019 ability to\nprovide needed redress for violations of individuals\u2019 rights under\nfederal law, I respectfully dissent.Footnote 1Though the Court reserves the general\nquestion whether RLUIPA is a valid exercise of Congress\u2019 power\nunder the Spending Clause, seeante, at 2, n.\u00a01,\nthere is apparently no disagreement among the Federal Courts of\nAppeals, see 560 F.\u00a03d 316, 328, n. 34 (CA5 2009) (\u201cEvery\ncircuit to consider whether RLUIPA is Spending Clause legislation\nhas concluded that it is constitutional under at least that\npower\u201d).Footnote 2The majority suggests that our use of the\nphrase \u201cappropriate relief\u201d inFranklinandBarnesdid not \u201cput the States on notice that the same\nphrase in RLUIPA subjected them to suits for monetary relief,\u201d\nbecause \u201c[t]hose cases did not involve sovereign defendants.\u201dAnte, at 10, n.\u00a06. The majority misperceives the\npoint.FranklinandBarnessimply confirmed what\notherwise would have been already apparent to any informed reader\nof RLUIPA\u2014when it comes to remedying injuries to legal rights,\nmonetary damages are \u201cappropriate relief.\u201d Moreover, as noted in\nthe text, seesupra, at 4\u20135, the Administrative Procedure\nAct expressly excludes \u201cmoney damages\u201d from the \u201crelief\u201d available\nagainst the United States, suggesting that Congress understands the\nterm normally to encompass monetary relief even when the defendant\nenjoys sovereign immunity. See 5 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7702;Bowenv.Massachusetts,487 U. S. 879, 891\u2013892\n(1988) (noting that \u00a7702 waives the United States\u2019 sovereign\nimmunity to suit).Footnote 3Curiously, the majority appears to believe\nthat it would be appro-priate for state officials to read the\nstatutory phrase \u201cappropriate relief\u201d without reference to general\nremedies principles. Seeante, at 12, n.\u00a08. It is\nwell-established, however, that \u201cCongress is understood to\nlegislate against a background of common-law \u2026 principles,\u201dAstoria Fed. Sav. & Loan Assn.v.Solimino,501 U. S. 104,\n108 (1991), and there can be no doubt that general legal principles\nnecessarily inform judicial determinations as to what remedies are\navailable to civil plaintiffs, see,e.g.,Atlantic\nSounding Co.v.Townsend, 557 U. S. ___, ___ (2009)\n(slip op., at 15) (concluding that, in light of \u201cgeneral principles\nof maritime tort law\u201d punitive damages were a remedy available to\nthe plaintiff (internal quotation marks omitted)). Why Texas\u2019s\nsovereign immunity defense renders this approach improper is a\nmystery the majority opinion leaves unsolved.Footnote 4InLanev.Pe&nacute;a,518 U. S. 187(1996),United Statesv.Nordic Village, Inc.,503 U. S. 30(1992), andHoffmanv.Connecticut Dept. of Income\nMaintenance,492\nU. S. 96(1989), we simply reaffirmed the principle that a\nsovereign\u2019s liability for damages must be unambiguously expressed\nin the statute purporting to waive immunity; as demonstrated above,\nRLUIPA satisfies this requirement. The majority tellingly relies on\nthedissent\u2019sassertion inWestv.Gibson,527 U. S. 212(1999), that the phrase\n\u201cappropriate remedies\u201d was too ambiguous to waive sovereign\nimmunity to monetary relief. Seeid., at 226 (opinion of\nKennedy, J.). Accordingly, the cases the majority cites do not\nmandate the conclusion it draws today.Footnote 5I agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that,\nbecause Section 3 of RLUIPA, addressing the rights of\ninstitutionalized persons, is not a \u201cprovisio[n] of [a] \u2026 Federal\nstatute prohibiting discrimination\u201d within the meaning of the\nRehabilitation Act Amendments of 1986, 42 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a72000d\u20137(a)(1), the latter statute\u2019s waiver provision does not put\nthe States on notice that they can be sued for damages under\nRLUIPA. Seeante, at 12\u201314. It bears noting, however, that\nSection 2 of RLUIPA explicitly prohibits discrimination in land use\nregulation. See \u00a72000cc(b)(2) (\u201cNo government shall impose or\nimplement a land use regulation that discriminates \u2026 on the basis\nof religion or religious denomination\u201d). As a result, the\nmajority\u2019s decision in this case means that some RLUIPA plaintiffs\nwill be able to seek monetary damages against a State and others\nwill not, even though RLUIPA\u2019s provision of \u201cappropriate relief\u201d\napplies equally to suits for violations of the terms of both\nSection 2 and Section 3.Footnote 6SeeParents Involved in Community\nSchoolsv.Seattle School Dist. No. 1,551 U. S. 701, 719\n(2007) (\u201cVoluntary cessation does not moot a case or controversy\nunless subsequent events make it absolutely clear that the\nallegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to\nrecur\u201d (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted)). The\nFifth Circuit declined to apply the \u201cvoluntary cessation\u201d doctrine\nin this case and instead granted Texas\u2019s motion that the court\ndismiss as moot petitioner\u2019s claim for injunctive relief with\nrespect to the prison\u2019s cell-restriction policy. Because the prison\ndirector averred that the policy was no longer in force, and\n\u201cabsent evidence that the voluntary ces-sation [wa]s a sham,\u201d the\ncourt held that the \u201cgood faith nature\u201d of Texas\u2019s change in policy\nrendered moot petitioner\u2019s claim for injunctive relief.
