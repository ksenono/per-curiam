S. ____ (2009)SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESNO. 08-441JACK GROSS, PETITIONERv.FBL FINANCIAL\nSERVICES, INC.on writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the eighth circuit[June 18, 2009]Justice Thomas delivered the\nopinion of the Court.The question presented by the\npetitioner in this case is whether a plaintiff must present direct\nevidence of age discrimination in order to obtain a mixed-motives\njury instruction in a suit brought under the Age Discrimination in\nEmployment Act of 1967 (ADEA), 81 Stat. 602, as amended, 29 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a7621et seq. Because we hold that such a jury\ninstruction is never proper in an ADEA case, we vacate the decision\nbelow.IPetitioner Jack Gross began\nworking for respondent FBL Financial Group, Inc. (FBL), in 1971. As\nof 2001, Gross held the position of claims administration director.\nBut in 2003, when he was 54 years old, Gross was reassigned to the\nposition of claims project coordinator. At that same time, FBL\ntransferred many of Gross\u2019 job responsibilities to a newly created\nposition\u2014claims administration manager. That position was given to\nLisa Kneeskern, who had previously been supervised by Gross and who\nwas then in her early forties. App. to Pet. for Cert. 23a (District\nCourt opinion). Although Gross (in his new position) and Kneeskern\nreceived the same compensation, Gross considered the reassignment a\ndemotion because of FBL\u2019s reallocation of his former job\nresponsibilities to Kneeskern.In April 2004, Gross filed suit\nin District Court, alleging that his reassignment to the position\nof claims project coordinator violated the ADEA, which makes it\nunlawful for an employer to take adverse action against an employee\n\u201cbecause of such individual\u2019s age.\u201d 29 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7623(a). The\ncase proceeded to trial, where Gross introduced evidence suggesting\nthat his reassignment was based at least in part on his age. FBL\ndefended its decision on the grounds that Gross\u2019 reassignment was\npart of a corporate restructuring and that Gross\u2019 new position was\nbetter suited to his skills. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 23a\n(District Court opinion).At the close of trial, and over FBL\u2019s\nobjections, the District Court instructed the jury that it must\nreturn a verdict for Gross if he proved, by a preponderance of the\nevidence, that FBL \u201cdemoted [him] to claims projec[t] coordinator\u201d\nand that his \u201cage was a motivating factor\u201d in FBL\u2019s decision to\ndemote him. App. 9\u201310. The jury was further instructed that Gross\u2019\nage would qualify as a \u201c\u00a0\u2018motivating factor,\u2019 if [it] played a\npart or a role in [FBL]\u2019s decision to demote [him].\u201dId.,\nat 10. The jury was also instructed regarding FBL\u2019s burden of\nproof. According to the District Court, the \u201cverdict must be for\n[FBL] \u2026 if it has been proved by the preponderance of the evidence\nthat [FBL] would have demoted [Gross] regardless of his age.\u201dIbid.The jury returned a verdict for Gross, awarding him\n$46,945 in lost compensation.Id., at 8.FBL challenged the jury instructions on\nappeal. The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit\nreversed and remanded for a new trial, holding that the jury had\nbeen incorrectly instructed under the standard established inPrice Waterhousev.Hopkins,490 U. S. 228(1989).\nSee 526 F.\u00a03d 356, 358 (2008). InPrice Waterhouse,\nthis Court addressed the proper allocation of the burden of\npersuasion in cases brought under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act\nof 1964, 78 Stat. 253, as amended, 42 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a72000eet\nseq., when an employee alleges that he suffered an adverse\nemployment action because of both permissible and impermissible\nconsiderations\u2014i.e., a \u201cmixed-motives\u201d case. 490 U. S., at\n232, 244\u2013247 (plurality opinion). ThePrice Waterhousedecision was splintered. Four Justices joined a plurality opinion,\nseeid., at 231\u2013258, Justices White and O\u2019Connor\nseparately concurred in the judgment, seeid., at 258\u2013261\n(opinion of White, J.);id., at 261\u2013279 (opinion of\nO\u2019Connor, J.), and three Justices dissented, seeid., at\n279\u2013295 (opinion of Kennedy, J.). Six Justices ultimately agreed\nthat if a Title VII plaintiff shows that discrimination was a\n\u201cmotivating\u201d or a \u201c\u00a0\u2018substantial\u2019\u00a0\u201d factor in the\nemployer\u2019s action, the burden of persuasion should shift to the\nemployer to show that it would have taken the same action\nregardless of that impermissible consideration. Seeid.,\nat 258 (plurality opinion);id., at 259\u2013260 (opinion of\nWhite, J.);id., at 276 (opinion of O\u2019Connor, J.). Justice\nO\u2019Connor further found that to shift the burden of persuasion to\nthe employer, the employee must present \u201cdirect evidence that an\nillegitimate criterion was a substantial factor in the [employment]\ndecision.\u201dId., at 276.In accordance with Circuit precedent, the\nCourt of Appeals identified Justice O\u2019Connor\u2019s opinion as\ncontrolling. See 526 F.\u00a03d, at 359 (citingEricksonv.Farmland Industries, Inc., 271 F.\u00a03d 718, 724 (CA8\n2001)). Applying that standard, the Court of Appeals found that\nGross needed to present \u201c[d]irect evidence \u2026 sufficient to support\na finding by a reasonable fact finder that an illegitimate\ncriterion actually motivated the adverse employment action.\u201d 526\nF.\u00a03d, at 359 (internal quotation marks omitted). In the Court\nof Appeals\u2019 view, \u201cdirect evidence\u201d is only that evidence that\n\u201cshow[s] a specific link between the alleged discriminatory animus\nand the challenged decision.\u201dIbid.(internal quotation\nmarks omitted). Only upon a presentation of such evidence, the\nCourt of Appeals held, should the burden shift to the employer\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018to convince the trier of fact that it is more likely than\nnot that the decision would have been the same absent consideration\nof the illegitimate factor.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIbid.(quotingPrice Waterhouse,supra, at 276 (opinion of\nO\u2019Connor, J.)).The Court of Appeals thus concluded that the\nDistrict Court\u2019s jury instructions were flawed because they allowed\nthe burden to shift to FBL upon a presentation of a preponderance\nofanycategory of evidence showing that age was a\nmotivating factor\u2014not just \u201cdirect evidence\u201d related to FBL\u2019s\nalleged consideration of age. See 526 F.\u00a03d, at 360. Because\nGross conceded that he had not presented direct evidence of\ndiscrimination, the Court of Appeals held that the District Court\nshould not have given the mixed-motives instruction.Ibid.Rather, Gross should have been held to the burden of persuasion\napplicable to typical, non-mixed-motives claims; the jury thus\nshould have been instructed only to determine whether Gross had\ncarried his burden of \u201cprov[ing] that age was the determining\nfactor in FBL\u2019s employment action.\u201d Seeibid.We granted certiorari, 555 U. S. ___ (2008),\nand now vacate the decision of the Court of Appeals.IIThe parties have asked us to\ndecide whether a plaintiff must \u201cpresent direct evidence of\ndiscrimination in order to obtain a mixed-motive instruction in a\nnon-Title VII discrimination case.\u201d Pet. for Cert. i. Before\nreaching this question, however, we must first determine whether\nthe burden of persuasion ever shifts to the party defending an\nalleged mixed-motives discrimination claim brought under the\nADEA.[Footnote 1] We hold that\nit does not.APetitioner relies on this Court\u2019s\ndecisions construing Title VII for his interpretation of the ADEA.\nBecause Title VII is materially different with respect to the\nrelevant burden of persuasion, however, these decisions do not\ncontrol our construction of the ADEA.InPrice Waterhouse, a\nplurality of the Court and two Justices concurring in the judgment\ndetermined that once a \u201cplaintiff in a Title VII case proves that\n[the plaintiff\u2019s membership in a protected class] played a\nmotivating part in an employment decision, the defendant may avoid\na finding of liability only by proving by a preponderance of the\nevidence that it would have made the same decision even if it had\nnot taken [that factor] into account.\u201d 490 U. S., at 258; see alsoid., at 259\u2013260 (opinion of White, J.);id., at\n276 (opinion of O\u2019Connor, J.). But as we explained inDesert\nPalace, Inc.v.Costa,539 U. S. 90, 94\u201395 (2003), Congress\nhas since amended Title VII by explicitly authorizing\ndiscrimination claims in which an improper consideration was \u201ca\nmotivating factor\u201d for an adverse employment decision. See 42 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a72000e\u20132(m) (providing that \u201can unlawful employment\npractice is established when the complaining party demonstrates\nthat race, color, religion, sex, or national origin wasa\nmotivating factorfor any employment practice, even though\nother factors also motivated the practice\u201d (emphasis added));\n\u00a72000e\u20135(g)(2)(B) (restricting the remedies available to plaintiffs\nproving violations of \u00a72000e\u20132(m)).This Court has never held that this\nburden-shifting framework applies to ADEA claims. And, we decline\nto do so now. When conducting statutory interpretation, we \u201cmust be\ncareful not to apply rules applicable under one statute to a\ndifferent statute without careful and critical examination.\u201dFederal Express Corp.v.Holowecki, 552 U. S.\n___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 2). Unlike Title VII, the ADEA\u2019s text\ndoes not provide that a plaintiff may establish discrimination by\nshowing that age was simply a motivating factor. Moreover, Congress\nneglected to add such a provision to the ADEA when it amended Title\nVII to add \u00a7\u00a72000e\u20132(m) and 2000e\u20135(g)(2)(B), even though it\ncontemporaneously amended the ADEA in several ways, see Civil\nRights Act of 1991, \u00a7115, 105 Stat. 1079;id., \u00a7302, at\n1088.We cannot ignore Congress\u2019 decision to amend\nTitle VII\u2019s relevant provisions but not make similar changes to the\nADEA. When Congress amends one statutory provision but not another,\nit is presumed to have acted intentionally. SeeEEOCv.Arabian American Oil Co.,499 U. S. 244, 256\n(1991). Furthermore, as the Court has explained, \u201cnegative\nimplications raised by disparate provisions are strongest\u201d when the\nprovisions were \u201cconsidered simultaneously when the language\nraising the implication was inserted.\u201dLindhv.Murphy,521\nU. S. 320, 330 (1997). As a result, the Court\u2019s interpretation\nof the ADEA is not governed by Title VII decisions such asDesert PalaceandPrice Waterhouse.[Footnote 2]BOur inquiry therefore must focus\non the text of the ADEA to decide whether it authorizes a\nmixed-motives age discrimination claim. It does not. \u201cStatutory\nconstruction must begin with the language employed by Congress and\nthe assumption that the ordinary meaning of that language\naccurately expresses the legislative purpose.\u201dEngine Mfrs.\nAssn.v.South Coast Air Quality Management Dist.,541 U. S. 246,\n252 (2004) (internal quotation marks omitted). The ADEA provides,\nin relevant part, that \u201c[i]t shall be unlawful for an employer \u2026 to\nfail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual or otherwise\ndiscriminate against any individual with respect to his\ncompensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment,because ofsuch individual\u2019s age.\u201d 29 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7623(a)(1) (emphasis added).The words \u201cbecause of\u201d mean \u201cby\nreason of: on account of.\u201d 1 Webster\u2019s Third New International\nDictionary 194 (1966); see also 1 Oxford English Dictionary 746\n(1933) (defining \u201cbecause of\u201d to mean \u201cBy reasonof, on\naccountof\u201d (italics in original)); The Random House\nDictionary of the English Language 132 (1966) (defining \u201cbecause\u201d\nto mean \u201cby reason; on account\u201d). Thus, the ordinary meaning of the\nADEA\u2019s requirement that an employer took adverse action \u201cbecause\nof\u201d age is that age was the \u201creason\u201d that the employer decided to\nact. SeeHazen Paper Co.v.Biggins,507 U. S. 604, 610\n(1993) (explaining that the claim \u201ccannot succeed unless the\nemployee\u2019s protected trait actually played a role in [the\nemployer\u2019s decisionmaking] processand had a determinative\ninfluence on the outcome\u201d (emphasis added)). To establish a\ndisparate-treatment claim under the plain language of the ADEA,\ntherefore, a plaintiff must prove that age was the \u201cbut-for\u201d cause\nof the employer\u2019s adverse decision. SeeBridgev.Phoenix Bond & Indemnity Co., 553 U. S. ___, ___\n(2008) (slip op., at 14) (recognizing that the phrase, \u201cby reason\nof,\u201d requires at least a showing of \u201cbut for\u201d causation (internal\nquotation marks omitted));Safeco Ins. Co. of Americav.Burr,551 U.\nS. 47, 63\u201364, and n. 14 (2007) (observing that \u201c[i]n common\ntalk, the phrase \u2018based on\u2019 indicates a but-for causal relationship\nand thus a necessary logical condition\u201d and that the statutory\nphrase, \u201cbased on,\u201d has the same meaning as the phrase, \u201cbecause\nof\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); cf. W. Keeton, D. Dobbs,\nR. Keeton, & D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law of Torts 265\n(5th ed. 1984) (\u201cAn act or omission is not regarded as a cause of\nan event if the particular event would have occurred without\nit\u201d).[Footnote 3]It follows, then, that under \u00a7623(a)(1), the\nplaintiff retains the burden of persuasion to establish that age\nwas the \u201cbut-for\u201d cause of the employer\u2019s adverse action. Indeed,\nwe have previously held that the burden is allocated in this manner\nin ADEA cases. SeeKentucky Retirement Systemsv.EEOC, 554 U. S. ___, ___\u2013___, ___\u2013___ (2008) (slip op., at\n2\u20134, 11\u201313);Reevesv.Sanderson Plumbing Products,\nInc.,530 U. S. 133, 141, 143 (2000). And\nnothing in the statute\u2019s text indicates that Congress has carved\nout an exception to that rule for a subset of ADEA cases. Where the\nstatutory text is \u201csilent on the allocation of the burden of\npersuasion,\u201d we \u201cbegin with the ordinary default rule that\nplaintiffs bear the risk of failing to prove their claims.\u201dSchafferv.Weast,546 U. S. 49, 56 (2005);\nsee alsoMeachamv.Knolls Atomic Power\nLaboratory, 554 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 6)\n(\u201cAbsent some reason to believe that Congress intended otherwise, \u2026\nwe will conclude that the burden of persuasion lies where it\nusually falls, upon the party seeking relief\u201d (internal quotation\nmarks omitted)). We have no warrant to depart from the general rule\nin this setting.Hence, the burden of persuasion necessary to\nestablish employer liability is the same in alleged mixed-motives\ncases as in any other ADEA disparate-treatment action. A plaintiff\nmust prove by a preponderance of the evidence (which may be direct\nor circumstantial), that age was the \u201cbut-for\u201d cause of the\nchallenged employer decision. SeeReeves,supra,\nat 141\u2013143, 147.[Footnote\n4]IIIFinally, we reject petitioner\u2019s\ncontention that our interpretation of the ADEA is controlled byPrice Waterhouse, which initially established that the\nburden of persuasion shifted in alleged mixed-motives Title VII\nclaims.[Footnote 5] In any\nevent, it is far from clear that the Court would have the same\napproach were it to consider the question today in the first\ninstance. Cf.14 Penn Plaza LLCv.Pyett, 556 U.\nS. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 21) (declining to \u201cintroduc[e] a\nqualification into the ADEA that is not found in its text\u201d);Meacham,supra, at ___ (slip op., at 16)\n(explaining that the ADEA must be \u201cread \u2026 the way Congress wrote\nit\u201d).Whatever the deficiencies ofPrice Waterhousein retrospect, it has become evident in\nthe years since that case was decided that its burden-shifting\nframework is difficult to apply. For example, in cases tried to a\njury, courts have found it particularly difficult to craft an\ninstruction to explain its burden-shifting framework. See,e.g.,Tylerv.Bethlehem Steel Corp.,\n958 F.\u00a02d 1176, 1179 (CA2 1992) (referring to \u201cthe murky water\nof shifting burdens in discrimination cases\u201d);Visserv.Packer Engineering Associates, Inc., 924 F.\u00a02d 655,\n661 (CA7 1991) (en banc) (Flaum, J., dissenting) (\u201cThe difficulty\njudges have in formulating [burden-shifting] instructions and\njurors have in applying them can be seen in the fact that jury\nverdicts in ADEA cases are supplanted by judgments notwithstanding\nthe verdict or reversed on appeal more frequently than jury\nverdicts generally\u201d). Thus, even ifPrice Waterhousewas\ndoctrinally sound, the problems associated with its application\nhave eliminated any perceivable benefit to extending its framework\nto ADEA claims. Cf.Continental T. V., Inc.v.GTE\nSylvania Inc.,433 U. S. 36, 47 (1977)\n(reevaluating precedent that was subject to criticism and\n\u201ccontinuing controversy and confusion\u201d);Paynev.Tennessee,501 U. S. 808, 839\u2013844\n(1991) (Souter, J., concurring).[Footnote 6]IVWe hold that a plaintiff bringing\na disparate-treatment claim pursuant to the ADEA must prove, by a\npreponderance of the evidence, that age was the \u201cbut-for\u201d cause of\nthe challenged adverse employment action. The burden of persuasion\ndoes not shift to the employer to show that it would have taken the\naction regardless of age, even when a plaintiff has produced some\nevidence that age was one motivating factor in that decision.\nAccordingly, we vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and\nremand the case for further proceedings consistent with this\nopinion.It is so ordered.Footnote 1Although the parties did not specifically\nframe the question to include this threshold inquiry, \u201c[t]he\nstatement of any question presented is deemed to comprise every\nsubsidiary question fairly included therein.\u201d This Court\u2019s Rule\n14.1; see also City of Sherrillv.Oneida Indian Nation of\nN.\u00a0Y.,544\nU. S. 197, 214, n.\u00a08 (2005) (\u201c\u00a0\u2018Questions not\nexplicitly mentioned but essential to the analysis of the decisions\nbelow or to the correct disposition of the other issues have been\ntreated as subsidiary issues fairly comprised by the question\npresented\u2019\u00a0\u201d (quoting R. Stern, E. Gressman, S. Shapiro, &\nK. Geller, Supreme Court Practice 414 (8th ed. 2002)));Ballardv.Commissioner,544 U.

But the Court\u2019s approach to\ninterpreting the ADEA in light of Title VII has not been uniform.\nInGeneral Dynamics Land Systems, Inc.v.Cline,540 U. S. 581(2004), for example, the Court declined to interpret the phrase\n\u201cbecause of \u2026 age\u201d in 29 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7623(a) to bar\ndiscrimination against people of all ages, even though the Court\nhad previously interpreted \u201cbecause of \u2026 race [or] sex\u201d in Title\nVII to bar discrimination against people of all races and both\nsexes, see 540 U. S., at 584, 592, n.\u00a05. And the Court has not\ndefinitively decided whether the evidentiary framework ofMcDonnell Douglas Corp.v.Green,411 U. S. 792(1973),\nutilized in Title VII cases is appropriate in the ADEA context. SeeReevesv. Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc.,530 U. S. 133, 142 (2000);O\u2019Connorv.Consolidated Coin Caterers Corp.,517 U. S. 308,\n311 (1996). In this instance, it is the textual differences between\nTitle VII and the ADEA that prevent us from applyingPrice\nWaterhouseandDesert Palaceto federal age\ndiscrimination claims.Footnote 3Justice Breyer contends that there is\n\u201cnothing unfair or impractical\u201d about hinging liability on whether\n\u201cforbidden motive \u2026 play[ed] a role in the employer\u2019s decision.\u201dPost, at 2\u20133 (dissenting opinion). But that is a decision\nfor Congress to make. SeeFlorida Dept. of Revenuev.Piccadilly Cafeterias, Inc., 554 U. S. ___, ___ (2008)\n(slip op., at 18). Congress amended Title VII to allow for employer\nliability when discrimination \u201cwasa motivating factorfor\nany employment practice, even though other factors also motivated\nthe practice,\u201d 42 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a72000e\u20132(m) (emphasis added), but\ndid not similarly amend the ADEA, seesupra, at 5\u20136. We\nmust give effect to Congress\u2019 choice. See14 Penn Plaza\nLLCv.Pyett, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at\n21).Footnote 4Because we hold that ADEA plaintiffs retain\nthe burden of persuasion to prove all disparate-treatment claims,\nwe do not need to address whether plaintiffs must present direct,\nrather than circumstantial, evidence to obtain a burden-shifting\ninstruction. There is no heightened evidentiary requirement for\nADEA plaintiffs to satisfy their burden of persuasion that age was\nthe \u201cbut-for\u201d cause of their employer\u2019s adverse action, see 29 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a7623(a), and we will imply none. \u201cCongress has been\nunequivocal when imposing heightened proof requirements\u201d in other\nstatutory contexts, including in other subsections within Title 29,\nwhen it has seen fit. SeeDesert Palace, Inc.v.Costa,539 U. S. 90, 99 (2003); see also,e.g., 25 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a72504(b)(2)(B) (imposing \u201cclear and\nconvincing evidence\u201d standard); 29 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7722(a)(2)(A)\n(same).Footnote 5Justice Stevens also contends that we must\napplyPrice Waterhouseunder the reasoning ofSmithv.City of Jackson,544 U. S. 228(2005).\nSeepost, at 7. InSmith, the Court applied to\nthe ADEA its pre-1991 interpretation of Title VII with respect to\ndisparate-impact claims despite Congress\u2019 1991 amendment adding\ndisparate-impact claims to Title VII but not the ADEA. 544 U. S.,\nat 240. But the amendments made by Congress in this same\nlegislation, which added the \u201cmotivating factor\u201d language to Title\nVII, undermine Justice Stevens\u2019 argument. Congress not only\nexplicitly added \u201cmotivating factor\u201d liability to Title VII, seesupra, at 5\u20136, but it also partially abrogatedPrice\nWaterhouse\u2019s holding by eliminating an employer\u2019s complete\naffirmative defense to \u201cmotivating factor\u201d claims, see 42 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a72000e\u20135(g)(2)(B). If such \u201cmotivating factor\u201d claims\nwere already part of Title VII, the addition of \u00a72000e\u20135(g)(2)(B)\nalone would have been sufficient. Congress\u2019 careful tailoring of\nthe \u201cmotivating factor\u201d claim in Title VII, as well as the absence\nof a provision parallel to \u00a72000e\u20132(m) in the ADEA, confirms that\nwe cannot transfer thePrice Waterhouseburden-shifting\nframework into the ADEA.Footnote 6Gross points out that the Court has also\napplied a burden-shifting framework to certain claims brought in\ncontexts other than pursuant to Title VII. See Brief for Petitioner\n54\u201355 (citing,inter alia,NLRBv.Transportation Management Corp.,462 U. S. 393, 401\u2013403\n(1983) (claims brought under the National Labor Relations Act\n(NLRA));Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Ed.v.Doyle,429 U. S. 274,\n287 (1977) (constitutional claims)). These cases, however, do not\nrequire the Court to adopt his contra statutory position.\u00a0 The\ncase involving the NLRA did not require the Court to decide in the\nfirst instance whether burden shifting should apply as the Court\ninstead deferred to the National Labor Relation Board\u2019s\ndetermination that such a framework was appropriate. SeeNLRB,supra, at 400\u2013403. And the constitutional\ncases such asMt. Healthyhave no bearing on the correct\ninterpretation of ADEA claims, which are governed by statutory\ntext.",
