SCOTT APPLINGon writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the eleventh circuit[June 4, 2018]Justice Sotomayor delivered the opinion of the\nCourt.[1]*The Bankruptcy Code prohibits debtors from\ndischarging debts for money, property, services, or credit obtained\nby \u201cfalse pretenses, a false representation, or actual fraud,\u201d 11\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7523(a)(2)(A), or, if made in writing, by a\nmaterially false \u201cstatement .\u00a0.\u00a0. respecting the debtor\u2019s\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. financial condition,\u201d \u00a7523(a)(2)(B).This case is about what constitutes a \u201cstatement\nrespecting the debtor\u2019s financial condition.\u201d Does a statement\nabout a single asset qualify, or must the statement be about the\ndebtor\u2019s overall financial status? The answer matters to the\nparties because the false statements at issue concerned a single\nasset and were made orally. So, if the single-asset statements here\nqualify as \u201crespecting the debtor\u2019s financial condition,\u201d\n\u00a7523(a)(2)(B) poses no bar to discharge because they were not made\nin writing. If, however, the statements fall into the more general\ncategory of \u201cfalse pretenses, .\u00a0.\u00a0. false representation,\nor actual fraud,\u201d \u00a7523(a)(2)(A), for which there is no writing\nrequirement, the associated debt will be deemed\nnondischargeable.The statutory language makes plain that a\nstatement about a single asset can be a \u201cstatement respecting the\ndebtor\u2019s financial condition.\u201d If that statement is not in writing,\nthen, the associated debt may be discharged, even if the statement\nwas false.IRespondent R. Scott Appling hired petitioner\nLamar, Archer & Cofrin, LLP (Lamar), a law firm, to represent\nhim in a business litigation. Appling fell behind on his legal\nbills, and by March 2005, he owed Lamar more than $60,000. Lamar\ninformed Appling that if he did not pay the outstanding amount, the\nfirm would withdraw from representation and place a lien on its\nwork product until the bill was paid. The parties met in person\nthat month, and Appling told his attorneys that he was expecting a\ntax refund of \u201c\u00a0\u2018approximately $100,000,\u2019\u00a0\u201d enough to\ncover his owed and future legal fees. App. to Pet. for Cert. 3a.\nLamar relied on this statement and continued to represent Appling\nwithout initiating collection of the overdue amount.When Appling and his wife filed their tax\nreturn, however, the refund they requested was of just $60,718, and\nthey ultimately received $59,851 in October 2005. Rather than\npaying Lamar, they spent the money on their business.Appling and his attorneys met again in November\n2005, and Appling told them that he had not yet received the\nrefund. Lamar relied on that statement and agreed to complete the\npending litigation and delay collection of the outstanding\nfees.In March 2006, Lamar sent Appling its final\ninvoice. Five years later, Appling still had not paid, so Lamar\nfiled suit in Georgia state court and obtained a judgment for\n$104,179.60. Shortly thereafter, Appling and his wife filed for\nChapter 7 bankruptcy.Lamar initiated an adversary proceeding against\nAppling in Bankruptcy Court for the Middle District of Georgia. The\nfirm argued that because Appling made fraudulent statements about\nhis tax refund at the March and November 2005 meetings, his debt to\nLamar was nondischargeable pursuant to 11 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7523(a)(2)(A), which governs debts arising from \u201cfalse pretenses, a\nfalse representation, or actual fraud, other than a statement\nrespecting the debtor\u2019s .\u00a0.\u00a0. financial condition.\u201d\nAppling, in turn, moved to dismiss, contending that his alleged\nmisrepresentations were \u201cstatement[s] .\u00a0.\u00a0. respecting\n[his] financial condition\u201d and were therefore governed by\n\u00a7523(a)(2)(B), such that Lamar could not block discharge of the\ndebt because the statements were not \u201cin writing\u201d as required for\nnondischargeability under that provision.The Bankruptcy Court held that a statement\nregarding a single asset is not a \u201cstatement respecting the\ndebtor\u2019s financial condition\u201d and denied Appling\u2019s motion to\ndismiss. 500 B.\u00a0R. 246, 252 (MD Ga. 2013). After a trial, the\nBankruptcy Court found that Appling knowingly made two false\nrepresentations on which Lamar justifiably relied and that Lamar\nincurred damages as a result. It thus concluded that Appling\u2019s debt\nto Lamar was nondischargeable under \u00a7523(a)(2)(A). 527 B.\u00a0R.\n545, 550\u2013556 (MD Ga. 2015). The District Court affirmed. 2016 WL\n1183128 (MD Ga., Mar. 28, 2016).The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit\nreversed. It held that \u201c\u00a0\u2018statement[s] respecting the debtor\u2019s\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. financial condition\u2019 may include a statement about\na single asset.\u201dIn\u00a0re Appling, 848 F.\u00a03d 953, 960\n(2017). Because Appling\u2019s statements about his expected tax refund\nwere not in writing, the Court of Appeals held that \u00a7523(a)(2)(B)\ndid not bar Appling from discharging his debt to Lamar.Id.,at 961.The Court granted certiorari, 583 U.\u00a0S. ___\n(2018), to resolve a conflict among the Courts of Appeals as to\nwhether a statement about a single asset can be a \u201cstatement\nrespecting the debtor\u2019s financial condition.\u201d[2] We agree with the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s conclusion\nand affirm.IIAOne of the \u201cmain purpose[s]\u201d of the federal\nbankruptcy system is \u201cto aid the unfortunate debtor by giving him a\nfresh start in life, free from debts, except of a certain\ncharacter.\u201dStellwagenv.Clum, 245 U.\u00a0S. 605,\n617 (1918). To that end, the Bankruptcy Code contains broad\nprovisions for the discharge of debts, subject to exceptions. One\nsuch exception is found in 11 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7523(a)(2), which\nprovides that a discharge under Chapter 7, 11, 12, or 13 of the\nBankruptcy Code \u201cdoes not discharge an individual debtor from any\ndebt .\u00a0.\u00a0. for money, property, services, or an\nextension, renewal, or refinancing of credit, to the extent\nobtained by\u201d fraud. This exception is in keeping with the \u201cbasic\npolicy animating the Code of affording relief only to an \u2018honest\nbut unfortunate debtor.\u2019\u00a0\u201dCohenv.de la Cruz,\n523 U.\u00a0S. 213, 217 (1998).More specifically, \u00a7523(a)(2) excepts from\ndischarge debts arising from various forms of fraud. Subparagraph\n(A) bars discharge of debts arising from \u201cfalse pretenses, a false\nrepresentation, or actual fraud, other than a statement respecting\nthe debtor\u2019s .\u00a0.\u00a0. financial condition.\u201d Subparagraph\n(B), in turn, bars discharge of debts arising from a materially\nfalse \u201cstatement .\u00a0.\u00a0. respecting the debtor\u2019s\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. financial condition\u201d if that statement is \u201cin\nwriting.\u201dB1\u201cOur interpretation of the Bankruptcy Code\nstarts \u2018where all such inquiries must begin: with the language of\nthe statute itself.\u2019\u00a0\u201dRansomv.FIA Card Services,\nN.\u00a0A., 562 U.\u00a0S. 61, 69 (2011). As noted, the\nrelevant statutory text is the phrase \u201cstatement respecting the\ndebtor\u2019s financial condition.\u201d Because the Bankruptcy Code does not\ndefine the words \u201cstatement,\u201d \u201cfinancial condition,\u201d or\n\u201crespecting,\u201d we look to their ordinary meanings. Seeibid.There is no dispute as to the meaning of the\nfirst two terms. A \u201cstatement\u201d is \u201cthe act or process of stating,\nreciting, or presenting orally or on paper; something stated as a\nreport or narrative; a single declaration or remark.\u201d Webster\u2019s\nThird New International Dictionary 2229 (1976) (Webster\u2019s). As to\n\u201cfinancial condition,\u201d the parties agree, as does the United\nStates, that the term means one\u2019s overall financial status. See\nBrief for Petitioner 23; Brief for Respondent 25; Brief for United\nStates asAmicus Curiae12.For our purposes, then, the key word in the\nstatutory phrase is the preposition \u201crespecting,\u201d which joins\ntogether \u201cstatement\u201d and \u201cfinancial condition.\u201d As a matter of\nordinary usage, \u201crespecting\u201d means \u201cin view of: considering; with\nregard or relation to: regarding; concerning.\u201d Webster\u2019s 1934; see\nalso American Heritage Dictionary 1107 (1969) (\u201c[i]n relation to;\nconcerning\u201d); Random House Dictionary of the English Language 1221\n(1966) (\u201cregarding; concerning\u201d); Webster\u2019s New Twentieth Century\nDictionary 1542 (2d ed. 1967) (\u201cconcerning; about; regarding; in\nregard to; relating to\u201d).According to Lamar, these definitions reveal\nthat \u201c\u00a0\u2018respecting\u2019canbe \u2018defined broadly,\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nbut that the word \u201cisn\u2019t always used that way.\u201d Brief for\nPetitioner 27. The firm contends that \u201c\u00a0\u2018about,\u2019\u00a0\u201d\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018concerning,\u2019\u00a0\u201d \u201c\u00a0\u2018with reference to,\u2019\u00a0\u201d and\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018as regards\u2019\u00a0\u201d denote a more limited scope than\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018related to.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Brief for Petitioner 3, 18, 27. When\n\u201crespecting\u201d is understood to have one of these more limited\nmeanings, Lamar asserts, a \u201cstatement respecting the debtor\u2019s\nfinancial condition\u201d is \u201ca statement that is \u2018about,\u2019 or that makes\n\u2018reference to,\u2019 the debtor\u2019s overall financial state or\nwell-being.\u201dId., at 27\u201328. Under that formulation, a formal\nfinancial statement providing a detailed accounting of one\u2019s assets\nand liabilities would qualify, as would statements like\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018Don\u2019t worry, I am above water,\u2019\u00a0\u201d and \u201c\u00a0\u2018I am in\ngood financial shape.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId., at 19, 28. A statement\nabout a single asset would not.The Court finds no basis to conclude, however,\nat least in this context, that \u201crelated to\u201d has a materially\ndifferent meaning than \u201cabout,\u201d \u201cconcerning,\u201d \u201cwith reference to,\u201d\nand \u201cas regards.\u201d The definitions of these words are overlapping\nand circular, with each one pointing to another in the group.\n\u201cRelate\u201d means \u201cto be in relationship: have reference,\u201d and, in the\ncontext of the phrase \u201cin relation to,\u201d \u201creference, respect.\u201d\nWebster\u2019s 1916; see alsoid.,at 18a (Explanatory Note\n16.2). \u201cAbout\u201d means \u201cwith regard to,\u201d and is the equivalent of\n\u201cconcerning.\u201dId.,at 5. \u201cConcerning\u201d means \u201crelating to,\u201d\nand is the equivalent of \u201cregarding, respecting, about.\u201dId.,at 470. \u201cReference\u201d means \u201cthe capability or character\nof alluding to or bearing on or directing attention to something,\u201d\nand is the equivalent of \u201crelation\u201d and \u201crespect.\u201dId.,at\n1907. And \u201cregard\u201d means \u201cto have relation to or bearing upon:\nrelate to,\u201d and is the equivalent of \u201crelation\u201d and \u201crespect.\u201dId.,at 1911. The interconnected web formed by these words\nbelies the clear distinction Lamar attempts to impose. Lamar also\nfails to put forth an example of a phrase in a legal context\nsimilar to the one at issue here in which toggling between \u201crelated\nto\u201d and \u201cabout\u201d has any pertinent significance.Use of the word \u201crespecting\u201d in a legal context\ngenerally has a broadening effect, ensuring that the scope of a\nprovision covers not only its subject but also matters relating to\nthat subject. Cf.Kleppev.New Mexico, 426\nU.\u00a0S. 529, 539 (1976) (explaining that the Property Clause,\n\u201cin broad terms, gives Congress the power to determine what are\n\u2018needful\u2019 rules \u2018respecting\u2019 the public lands,\u201d and should receive\nan \u201cexpansive reading\u201d).Indeed, when asked to interpret statutory\nlanguage including the phrase \u201crelating to,\u201d which is one of the\nmeanings of \u201crespecting,\u201d this Court has typically read the\nrelevant text expansively. See,e.g., Coventry Health Care of\nMo., Inc.v.Nevils, 581 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2017)\n(slip op., at 7) (describing \u201c\u00a0\u2018relate to\u2019\u00a0\u201d as\n\u201cexpansive\u201d and noting that \u201cCongress characteristically employs\nthe phrase to reach any subject that has \u2018a connection with, or\nreference to,\u2019 the topics the statute enumerates\u201d);Moralesv.Trans World Airlines, Inc., 504 U.\u00a0S. 374, 378\u2013390\n(1992) (explaining that \u201c\u00a0\u2018relating to\u2019\u00a0\u201d has a \u201cbroad\u201d\nordinary meaning and accordingly holding that the Airline\nDeregulation Act of 1978 provision prohibiting the States from\nenforcing any law \u201c\u00a0\u2018relating to rates, routes, or\nservices\u2019\u00a0\u201d of any air carrier pre-empted any fare advertising\nguidelines that \u201cwould have a significant impact upon the airlines\u2019\nability to market their product, and hence a significant impact\nupon the fares they charge\u201d);Ingersoll-Rand Co.v.McClendon, 498 U.\u00a0S. 133, 139 (1990) (\u201c\u00a0\u2018A law\n\u201crelates to\u201d an employee benefit plan, in the normal sense of the\nphrase, if it has a connection with or reference to such a plan.\u2019\nUnder this \u2018broad common-sense meaning,\u2019 a state law may \u2018relate\nto\u2019 a benefit plan .\u00a0.\u00a0. even if the law is not\nspecifically designed to affect such plans, or the effect is only\nindirect\u201d (citation omitted)).Advancing that same expansive approach here,\nAppling contends that a \u201cstatement respecting the debtor\u2019s\nfinancial condition\u201d is \u201ca statement that has a direct relation to,\nor impact on the balance of all of the debtor\u2019s assets and\nliabilities or the debtor\u2019s overall financial status.\u201d Brief for\nRespondent 17 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). \u201cA\ndebtor\u2019s statement describing an individual asset or liability\nnecessarily qualifies,\u201d Appling explains, because it \u201chas a direct\nimpact on thesumof his assets and liabilities.\u201dIbid.\u201cPut differently, a debtor\u2019s statement that describes\nthe existence or value of a constituent element of the debtor\u2019s\nbalance sheet or income statement qualifies as a \u2018statement\nrespecting financial condition.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIbid.The United States asamicus curiaesupporting Appling offers a slightly different formulation. In its\nview, a \u201cstatement respecting the debtor\u2019s financial condition\u201d\nincludes \u201ca representation about a debtor\u2019s asset that is offered\nas evidence of ability to pay.\u201d Brief for United States asAmicus Curiae11. Although Appling does not include \u201cability\nto pay\u201d in his proffered definition, he and the United States agree\nthat their respective formulations are functionally the same and\nlead to the same results. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 50\u201352, 58. That is\nso because to establish the requisite materiality and reliance, a\ncreditor opposing discharge must explain why it viewed the debtor\u2019s\nfalse representation as relevant to the decision to extend money,\nproperty, services, or credit. If a given statement did not\nactually serve as evidence of ability to pay, the creditor\u2019s\nexplanation will not suffice to bar discharge. But if the creditor\nproves materiality and reliance, it will be clear the statement was\none \u201crespecting the debtor\u2019s financial condition.\u201d Whether a\nstatement about a single asset served as evidence of ability to pay\nthus ultimately always factors into the \u00a7523(a)(2) inquiry at some\npoint.We agree with both Appling and the United States\nthat, given the ordinary meaning of \u201crespecting,\u201d Lamar\u2019s preferred\nstatutory construction\u2014that a \u201cstatement respecting the debtor\u2019s\nfinancial condition\u201d means only a statement that captures the\ndebtor\u2019s overall financial status\u2014must be rejected, for it reads\n\u201crespecting\u201d out of the statute. SeeTRW Inc.v.Andrews, 534 U.\u00a0S. 19, 31 (2001) (\u201c[A] statute ought\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. to be so construed that .\u00a0.\u00a0. no clause,\nsentence, or word shall be superfluous, void, or insignificant\u201d\n(internal quotation marks omitted)). Had Congress intended\n\u00a7523(a)(2)(B) to encompass only statements expressing the balance\nof a debtor\u2019s assets and liabilities, there are several ways in\nwhich it could have so specified,e.g.,\u201cstatement\ndisclosing the debtor\u2019s financial condition\u201d or \u201cstatement of the\ndebtor\u2019s financial condition.\u201d[3] But Congress did not use such narrow language.We also agree that a statement is \u201crespecting\u201d a\ndebtor\u2019s financial condition if it has a direct relation to or\nimpact on the debtor\u2019s overall financial status. A single asset has\na direct relation to and impact on aggregate financial condition,\nso a statement about a single asset bears on a debtor\u2019s overall\nfinancial condition and can help indicate whether a debtor is\nsolvent or insolvent, able to repay a given debt or not. Naturally,\nthen, a statement about a single asset can be a \u201cstatement\nrespecting the debtor\u2019s financial condition.\u201d2Further supporting the Court\u2019s conclusion is\nthat Lamar\u2019s interpretation would yield incoherent results. On\nLamar\u2019s view, the following would obtain: A misrepresentation about\na single asset made in the context of a formal financial statement\nor balance sheet would constitute a \u201cstatement respecting the\ndebtor\u2019s financial condition\u201d and trigger \u00a7523(a)(2)(B)\u2019s\nheightened nondischargeability requirements, but the exact same\nmisrepresentation made on its own, or in the context of a list of\nsome but not all of the debtor\u2019s assets and liabilities, would not.\nLamar does not explain why Congress would draw such seemingly\narbitrary distinctions, where the ability to discharge a debt turns\non the superficial packaging of a statement rather than its\nsubstantive content.In addition, a highly general statement like, \u201cI\nam above water,\u201d would need to be in writing to foreclose\ndischarge, whereas a highly specific statement like, \u201cI have\n$200,000 of equity in my house,\u201d would not. This, too, is\ninexplicably bizarre.3Lastly, the statutory history of the phrase\n\u201cstatement respecting the debtor\u2019s financial condition\u201d\ncorroborates our reading of the text. That language can be traced\nback to a 1926 amendment to the Bankruptcy Act of 1898 that\nprohibited discharge entirely to a debtor who had \u201cobtained money\nor property on credit, or obtained an extension or renewal of\ncredit, by making or publishing, or causing to be made or\npublished, in any manner whatsoever, a materially false statement\nin writing respecting his financial condition.\u201d Act of May 27,\n1926, \u00a76, 44Stat. 663\u2013664.When Congress again amended this provision in\n1960, it retained the \u201cstatement in writing respecting\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. financial condition\u201d language. See Act of July 12,\n1960, Pub. L. 86\u2013621, \u00a72, 74Stat. 409. Congress then once more\npreserved that language when it rewrote and recodified the\nprovision in the modern Bankruptcy Code as \u00a7523(a)(2)(B).Given the historical presence of the phrase\n\u201cstatement respecting the debtor\u2019s financial condition,\u201d lower\ncourts had ample opportunity to weigh in on its meaning. Between\n1926, when the phrase was introduced, and 1978, when Congress\nenacted the Bankruptcy Code, Courts of Appeals consistently\nconstrued the phrase to encompass statements addressing just one or\nsome of a debtor\u2019s assets or liabilities.[4] When Congress used the materially same language in\n\u00a7523(a)(2), it presumptively was aware of the longstanding judicial\ninterpretation of the phrase and intended for it to retain its\nestablished meaning. SeeLorillardv.Pons, 434\nU.\u00a0S. 575, 580 (1978) (\u201cCongress is presumed to be aware of an\nadministrative or judicial interpretation of a statute and to adopt\nthat interpretation when it re-enacts a statute without change\u201d);Bragdonv.Abbott, 524 U.\u00a0S. 624, 645 (1998)\n(\u201cWhen administrative and judicial interpretations have settled the\nmeaning of an existing statutory provision, repetition of the same\nlanguage in a new statute indicates, as a general matter, the\nintent to incorporate its administrative and judicial\ninterpretations as well\u201d).IIIIn addition to its plain-text arguments\ndiscussed and rejected above, seesupra,at 5\u20137, Lamar\ncontends that Appling\u2019s rule undermines the purpose of \u00a7523(a)(2)\nin two ways. Neither argument is persuasive.AFirst, Lamar contends that Appling\u2019s\nconstruction gives \u00a7523(a)(2)(B) an implausibly broad reach, such\nthat little would be covered by \u00a7523(a)(2)(A)\u2019s general rule\nrendering nondischargeable debts arising from \u201cfalse pretenses, a\nfalse representation, or actual fraud.\u201d That is not so. Decisions\nfrom this Court and several lower courts considering the\napplication of \u00a7523(a)(2)(A) demonstrate that the provision still\nretains significant function when the phrase \u201cstatement respecting\nthe debtor\u2019s financial condition\u201d is interpreted to encompass a\nstatement about a single asset.Section 523(a)(2)(A) has been applied when a\ndebt arises from \u201cforms of fraud, like fraudulent conveyance\nschemes, that can be effected without a false representation.\u201dHusky Int\u2019l Electronics, Inc.v.Ritz, 578 U.\u00a0S.\n___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 3).[5] It also has been used to bar the discharge of debts\nresulting from misrepresentations about the value of goods,\nproperty, and services.[6]BSecond, Lamar asserts that Appling\u2019s\ninterpretation is inconsistent with the overall principle that the\nBankruptcy Code exists to afford relief only to the \u201c\u00a0\u2018honest\nbut unfortunate debtor,\u2019\u00a0\u201dCohen, 523 U.\u00a0S., at\n217, because it leaves \u201cfraudsters\u201d free to \u201cswindle innocent\nvictims for money, property or services by lying about their\nfinances, then discharge the resulting debt in bankruptcy, just so\nlong as they do so orally.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 35.This general maxim, however, provides little\nsupport for Lamar\u2019s interpretation. The text of \u00a7523(a)(2) plainly\nheightens the bar to discharge when the fraud at issue was\neffectuated via a \u201cstatement respecting the debtor\u2019s financial\ncondition.\u201d[7] The heightened\nrequirements, moreover, are not a shield for dishonest debtors.\nRather, they reflect Congress\u2019 effort to balance the potential\nmisuse of such statements by both debtors and creditors. As the\nCourt has explained previously:\u201cThe House Report on the [Bankruptcy\nReform Act of 1978] suggests that Congress wanted to moderate the\nburden on individuals who submitted false financial statements, not\nbecause lies about financial condition are less blameworthy than\nothers, but because the relative equities might be affected by\npractices of consumer finance companies, which sometimes have\nencouraged such falsity by their borrowers for the very purpose of\ninsulating their own claims from discharge.\u201dFieldv.Mans, 516 U.\u00a0S. 59, 76\u201377 (1995).Specifically, as detailed inField, the\nHouse Report noted that consumer finance companies frequently\ncollected information from loan applicants in ways designed to\npermit the companies to later use those statements as the basis for\nan exception to discharge. Commonly, a loan officer would instruct\na loan applicant \u201c\u00a0\u2018to list only a few or only the most\nimportant of his debts\u2019\u00a0\u201d on a form with too little space to\nsupply a complete list of debts, even though the phrase, \u201c\u00a0\u2018I\nhave no other debts,\u2019\u00a0\u201d would be printed at the bottom of the\nform or the applicant would be \u201c\u00a0\u2018instructed to write the\nphrase in his own handwriting.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId., at 77,\nn.\u00a013. If the debtor later filed for bankruptcy, the creditor\nwould contend that the debtor had made misrepresentations in his\nloan application and the creditor would threaten litigation over\nexcepting the debt from discharge. That threat was \u201coften enough to\ninduce the debtor to settle for a reduced sum,\u201d even where the\nmerits of the nondischargeability claim were weak. H.\u00a0R. Rep.\nNo. 95\u2013595, p. 131 (1977).Notably, Lamar\u2019s interpretation of \u201cstatement\nrespecting the debtor\u2019s financial condition\u201d would not bring within\n\u00a7523(a)(2)(B)\u2019s reach the very types of statements the House Report\ndescribed, because those debts-only statements said nothing about\nassets and thus did not communicate fully the debtor\u2019s overall\nfinancial status. Yet inField, the Court explained that the\nheightened requirements for nondischargeability under \u00a7523(a)(2)(B)\nwere intended to address creditor abuse involving such statements.\n516 U.\u00a0S., at 76\u201377. Lamar\u2019s construction also would render\n\u00a7523(a)(2)(B) subject to manipulation by creditors, frustrating the\nvery end Congress sought to avoid when it set forth heightened\nrequirements for rendering nondischargeable \u201cstatements respecting\nthe debtor\u2019s financial condition.\u201dIbid.Finally, although Lamar tries to paint a picture\nof defenseless creditors swindled by lying debtors careful to make\ntheir financial representations orally, creditors are not\npowerless. They can still benefit from the protection of\n\u00a7523(a)(2)(B) so long as they insist that the representations\nrespecting the debtor\u2019s financial condition on which they rely in\nextending money, property, services, or credit are made in writing.\nDoing so will likely redound to their benefit, as such writings can\nfoster accuracy at the outset of a transaction, reduce the\nincidence of fraud, and facilitate the more predictable, fair, and\nefficient resolution of any subsequent dispute.IVFor the foregoing reasons, the Court holds\nthat a statement about a single asset can be a \u201cstatement\nrespecting the debtor\u2019s financial condition\u201d under \u00a7523(a)(2) of\nthe Bankruptcy Code. The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the\nEleventh Circuit is affirmed.It is so ordered.Notes1*Justice Thomas, Justice Alito,\nand Justice Gorsuch join all but Part III\u2013B of this\nopinion.2CompareIn\u00a0re\nBandi, 683 F.\u00a03d 671, 676 (CA5 2012) (a statement about a\nsingle asset is not a statement respecting the debtor\u2019s financial\ncondition);In\u00a0re Joelson, 427 F.\u00a03d 700, 714\n(CA10 2005) (same), withIn\u00a0re Appling, 848 F.\u00a03d\n958, 960 (CA11 2017) (a statement about a single asset can be a\nstatement respecting the debtor\u2019s financial condition);Englerv.Van Steinburg, 744 F.\u00a02d 1060, 1061\n(CA4 1984) (same).3Congress in fact used\njust such \u201cstatement of\u201d language elsewhere in the Bankruptcy Code.\nSee,e.g.,11 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7329(a) (\u201cstatement of the\ncompensation paid\u201d); \u00a7521(a)(1)(B)(iii) (\u201cstatement of the debtor\u2019s\nfinancial affairs\u201d); \u00a7707(b)(2)(C) (\u201cstatement of the debtor\u2019s\ncurrent monthly income\u201d).4See,e.g., Tennv.First Hawaiian Bank, 549 F.\u00a02d 1356, 1358 (CA9 1977)\n(per curiam) (\u201c[A]ppellants\u2019 recordation of the deed which\nthey knew was false for the purpose of obtaining an extension of\ncredit on the basis of an asset that they did not own was a false\nstatement of financial condition\u201d (citingScottv.Smith, 232 F.\u00a02d 188, 190 (CA9 1956)));In\u00a0re\nButler, 425 F.\u00a02d 47, 49, 52 (CA3 1970) (affirming holding\nthat a corporation\u2019s false statements as to select accounts\nreceivable qualified as statements respecting financial condition);Shainmanv.Shear\u2019s of Affton, Inc., 387 F.\u00a02d\n33, 38 (CA8 1967) (\u201cA written statement purporting to set forth the\ntrue value of a major asset of a corporation, its inventory, is a\nstatement respecting the financial condition of that\ncorporation.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.
