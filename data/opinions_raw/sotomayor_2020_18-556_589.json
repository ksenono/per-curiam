I therefore\ndissent.II begin with common ground. The Fourth\nAmendment permits \u201cbrief investigatory\u201d vehicle stops,United\nStatesv.Cortez,449 U.S.\n411, 417 (1981), on \u201cfacts that do not constitute probable\ncause,\u201dUnited Statesv.Brignoni-Ponce,422 U.S.\n873, 881 (1975). To assess whether an officer had the requisite\nsuspicion to seize a driver, past cases have considered the\n\u201ctotality of the circumstances\u2014the whole picture,\u201dCortez,\n449 U.\u00a0S., at 417, and analyzed whether the officer assembled\n\u201cfact on fact and clue on clue,\u201did., at 419.The stop at issue here, however, rests on just\none key fact: that the vehicle was owned by someone with a revoked\nlicense. The majority concludes\u2014erroneously, in my view\u2014that\nseizing this vehicle was constitutional on the record below because\ndrivers with revoked licenses (as opposed to suspended licenses) in\nKansas \u201chave already demonstrated a disregard for the law or are\ncategorically unfit to drive.\u201dAnte, at 5. This analysis\nbreaks from settled doctrine and dramatically alters both the\nquantum and nature of evidence a State may rely on to prove\nsuspicion.AThe State bears the burden of justifying a\nseizure.Floridav.Royer,460\nU.S. 491, 500 (1983) (plurality opinion);Brownv.Texas,443 U.S.\n47, 51\u201352 (1979). This requires the government to articulate\nfactors supporting its reasonable suspicion, usually through a\ntrained agent. SeeOrnelasv.United States,517 U.S.\n690, 696 (1996); see alsoUnited Statesv.Sokolow,490 U.S.\n1, 10 (1989). While the Court has not dictated precisely what\nevidence a government must produce, it has stressed that an officer\nmust at least \u201carticulate more than an \u2018inchoate and\nunparticularized suspicion or \u201chunch\u201d\u00a0\u2019 of criminal activity.\u201dIllinoisv.Wardlow,528 U.S.\n119, 123\u2013124 (2000) (quotingTerryv.Ohio,392 U.S.\n1, 27 (1968)). That articulation must include both facts and an\nofficer\u2019s \u201crational inferences from those facts.\u201dBrignoni-Ponce, 422 U.\u00a0S., at 880, 884. A logical \u201cgap\nas to any one matter\u201d in this analysis may be overcome by \u201c\u00a0\u2018a\nstrong showing\u2019\u00a0\u201d regarding \u201c\u00a0\u2018other indicia of\nreliability.\u2019\u00a0\u201dFloridav.Harris,568 U.S.\n237, 245 (2013). But gaps may not go unfilled.Additionally, reasonable suspicion eschews\njudicial common sense,ante, at 5, in favor of the\nperspectives and inferences of a reasonable officer viewing \u201cthe\nfacts through the lens of his police experience and expertise.\u201dOrnelas, 517 U.\u00a0S., at 699;Cortez, 449\nU.\u00a0S., at 416\u2013418 (explaining that the facts and inferences\ngiving rise to a stop \u201cmust be seen and weighed .\u00a0.\u00a0. as\nunderstood by those versed in the field of law enforcement\u201d);Heienv.North Carolina,574 U.S.\n54, 73 (2014) (Sotomayor, J., dissenting) (\u201c[O]ur enunciation\nof the reasonableness inquiry and our justification for it\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. have always turned on an officer\u2019s factual\nconclusions and an officer\u2019s expertise with respect to those\nfactual conclusions\u201d). It is the reasonable officer\u2019s assessment,\nnot the ordinary person\u2019s\u2014or judge\u2019s\u2014judgment, that\nmatters.[1]Finally, a stop must be individualized\u2014that is,\nbased on \u201ca suspicion that the particular [subject] being stopped\nis engaged in wrongdoing.\u201dCortez, 449 U.\u00a0S., at 418;Prado Navarettev.California,572 U.S.\n393, 396\u2013397 (2014). This does not mean that the officer must\nknow the driver\u2019s identity. But a seizure must rest on more than\nthe \u201clikelihood that [a] given person\u201d or particular vehicle is\nengaged in wrongdoing.Brignoni-Ponce, 422 U.\u00a0S., at\n886\u2013887. The inquiry ordinarily involves some observation or report\nabout the target\u2019s behavior\u2014not merely the class to which he\nbelongs. See,e.g.,Navarette, 572 U.\u00a0S., at\n398, 402 (upholding vehicle stop based on an anonymous tip about\ndriver conduct, interpreted in light of the \u201caccumulated experience\nof thousands of officers\u201d);Sokolow, 490 U.\u00a0S., at 10\n(evaluating the collective facts giving rise to suspicion that an\nindividual was transporting narcotics instead of relying on law\nenforcement\u2019s simplified drug courier \u201c\u00a0\u2018profile\u2019\u00a0\u201d).BFaithful adherence to these precepts would\nyield a significantly different analysis and outcome than that\noffered by the majority.For starters, the majority flips the burden of\nproof. It permits Kansas police officers to effectuate roadside\nstops whenever they lack \u201cinformation negating an inference\u201d that a\nvehicle\u2019s unlicensed owner is its driver.Ante, at 1. This\nhas it backwards: The State shoulders the burden to supply the key\ninference that tethers observation to suspicion. The majority\nrepeatedly attributes such an inference to Deputy Mehrer.Ante, at 4, 6, 9. But that is an after-the-fact gloss on a\nseven-paragraph stipulation. Nowhere in his terse submission did\nDeputy Mehrer indicate that he had any informed belief about the\npropensity of unlicensed drivers to operate motor vehicles in the\narea\u2014let alone that he relied on such a belief in seizing Glover.Ante, at 1\u20132.The consequence of the majority\u2019s approach is to\nabsolve officers from any responsibility to investigate the\nidentity of a driver where feasible. But that is precisely what\nofficers ought to do\u2014and are more than capable of doing. Of course,\nsome circumstances may not warrant an officer approaching a car to\ntake a closer look at its occupants. But there are countless other\ninstances where officers have been able to ascertain the identity\nof a driver from a distance and make out their approximate age and\ngender. Indeed, our cases are rife with examples of officers who\nhave perceived more than just basic driver demographics. See,e.g.,Heien, 574 U.\u00a0S., at 57 (officer thought\nthat motorist was \u201c\u00a0\u2018very stiff and nervous\u2019\u00a0\u201d);United Statesv.Arvizu,534\nU.S. 266, 270 (2002) (officer observed an \u201cadult man\u201d driving\nwho \u201cappeared stiff\u201d);United Statesv.Ross, 456\nU.\u00a0S 798, 801 (1982) (officer pulled alongside car and noticed\nthat the driver matched a description from an informant);Brignoni-Ponce, 422 U.\u00a0S., at 875 (officers stopped a\nvehicle whose occupants \u201cappeared to be of Mexican descent\u201d). The\nmajority underestimates officers\u2019 capabilities and instead gives\nthem free rein to stop a vehicle involved in no suspicious activity\nsimply because it is registered to an unlicensed person. That stop\nis based merely on a guess or a \u201chunch\u201d about the driver\u2019s\nidentity.Wardlow, 528 U.\u00a0S., at 124 (internal\nquotation marks omitted).With no basis in the record to presume that\nunlicensed drivers routinely continue driving, the majority\nendeavors to fill the gap with its own \u201ccommon sense.\u201dAnte,\nat 5. But simply labeling an inference \u201ccommon sense\u201d does not make\nit so, no matter how many times the majority repeats it. Cf.ante, at 5, 6, 7, 8. Whether the driver of a vehicle is\nlikely to be its unlicensed owner is \u201cby no means obvious.\u201dAnte, at 1 (Kagan, J., concurring). And like the\nconcurrence, I \u201cdoubt\u201d that our collective judicial common sense\ncould answer that question, even if our Fourth Amendment\njurisprudence allowed us to do so.Ante, at 3.Contrary to the majority\u2019s claims,ante,\nat 3\u20135, 7, the reasonable-suspicion inquiry does not accommodate\nthe average person\u2019s intuition. Rather, it permits reliance on a\nparticular type of common sense\u2014that of the reasonable officer,\ndeveloped through her experiences in law enforcement.Cortez, 449 U.\u00a0S., at 418. This approach acknowledges\nthat what may be \u201ccommon sense\u201d to a layperson may not be relevant\n(or correct) in a law enforcement context. Indeed, this case\npresents the type of geographically localized inquiry where an\nofficer\u2019s \u201cinferences and deductions that might well elude an\nuntrained person\u201d would come in handy.Ibid.; see alsoArvizu, 534 U.\u00a0S., at 276 (prizing an officer\u2019s\n\u201cspecialized training and familiarity with the customs of the\narea\u2019s inhabitants\u201d). By relying on judicial inferences instead,\nthe majority promotes broad, inflexible rules that overlook\nregional differences.Allowing judges to offer their own brand of\ncommon sense where the State\u2019s proffered justifications for a\nsearch come up short also shifts police work to the judiciary. Our\ncases\u2014including those the majority cites\u2014have looked to officer\nsensibility to establish inferences about human behavior, even\nthough they just as easily could have relied on the inferences\n\u201cmade by ordinary people on a daily basis.\u201dAnte, at 6. See,e.g.,Navarette, 572 U.\u00a0S., at 402 (pointing to\n\u201cthe accumulated experience of thousands of officers\u201d to identify\ncertain \u201cerratic\u201d behaviors \u201cas sound indicia of drunk driving\u201d);Wardlow, 528 U.\u00a0S., at 124 (permitting officers to\naccount for the relevant characteristics of a location when\ninterpreting whether flight from police is \u201cevasive\u201d);Sokolow, 490 U.\u00a0S., at 9\u201310 (crediting the evidentiary\nsignificance of facts \u201cas seen by a trained agent\u201d to identify a\nsuspicious traveler). There is no reason to depart from that\npractice here.Finally, to bolster its conclusion as grounded\nin \u201ccommon experience,\u201d the majority cites \u201cempirical studies.\u201dAnte, at 4. But its use of statistics illustrates the danger\nof relying on large-scale data to carry out what is supposed to be\na particularized exercise. Neither of the referenced reports tells\nus the percentage of vehicle owners with revoked licenses in Kansas\nwho continue to drive their cars. Neither report even offers a\nuseful denominator: One lumps drivers with suspended and revoked\nlicenses together, while the other examines the license status of\nonly motorists involved in fatal collisions. The figures say\nnothing about how the behavior of revoked drivers measures up\nrelative to their licensed counterparts\u2014whether one group is more\nlikely to be involved in accidents, or whether the incidences are\ncomparable\u2014which would inform a trooper\u2019s inferences about driver\nidentity.As the concurrence recognizes, while statistics\nmay help a defendant challenge the reasonableness of an officer\u2019s\nactions, they \u201ccannot substitute for the individualized suspicion\nthat the Fourth Amendment requires.\u201dAnte, at 4\u20135, n. If\ncourts do not scrutinize officer observation or expertise in the\nreasonable-suspicion analysis, then seizures may be made on\nlarge-scale data alone\u2014data that say nothing about the individual\nsave for the class to which he belongs. That analytical approach\nstrays far from \u201cacting upon observed violations\u201d of law\u2014which this\nCourt has said is the \u201cforemost method of enforcing traffic and\nvehicle safety regulations.\u201dDelawarev.Prouse,440 U.S.\n648, 659 (1979).The majority today has paved the road to finding\nreasonable suspicion based on nothing more than a demographic\nprofile. Its logic has thus made the State\u2019s task all but\nautomatic. That has never been the law, and it never should be.IIThe majority\u2019s justifications for this new\napproach have no foundation in fact or logic. It supposes that\nrequiring officers to point to \u201ctraining materials or field\nexperiences\u201d would demand \u201c\u00a0\u2018scientific certainty.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAnte, at 3. But that is no truer in this case than in other\ncircumstances where the reasonable-suspicion inquiry applies.\nIndeed, the State here was invited to stipulate to the evidence it\nrelied on to make the stop. It could have easily described the\nindividual or \u201caccumulated experience\u201d of officers in the\njurisdiction. Cf.Navarette, 572 U.\u00a0S., at 402. The\nState chose not to present such evidence and has not shown that it\ncould not have done so. Accordingly, it has proved no harm to\nitself.[2]In fact, it is the majority\u2019s approach that\nmakes scant policy sense. If the State need not set forth all the\ninformation its officers considered before forming suspicion, what\nconceivable evidence could be used to mount an effective challenge\nto a vehicle stop, as the concurrence imagines?Ante, at 4.\nWho could meaningfully interrogate an officer\u2019s action when all the\nofficer has to say is that the vehicle was registered to an\nunlicensed driver? How would a driver counter that evidence\u2014by\nstating that they were of a different age or gender than the owner\nand insisting that the officer could have easily discerned that?\nAnd where would a defendant bring his arguments if the trial judge\nmakes the key inference, or by the same token, fails to make an\ninference that \u201cmight well elude\u201d the untrained?Cortez, 449\nU. S., at 418.Moreover, the majority\u2019s distinction between\nrevocation and suspension may not hold up in other jurisdictions.\nFor one, whether drivers with suspended licenses have \u201cdemonstrated\na disregard for the law or are categorically unfit to drive\u201d is\ncompletely unknown. And in several States, the grounds for\nrevocation include offenses unrelated to driving fitness, such as\nusing a license to unlawfully buy alcohol. See,e.g., Ky.\nRev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7186.560 (West Cum. Supp. 2019); Mont. Code Ann.\n\u00a761\u20135\u2013206 (2019); R.\u00a0I. Gen. Laws \u00a731\u201311\u20136 (2010). In yet\nother jurisdictions, \u201crevocation\u201d is the label assigned to a\ntemporary sanction, which may be imposed for such infractions as\nthe failure to comply with child support payments. Okla. Stat.,\nTit. 47, \u00a76\u2013201.1 (2011). Whether the majority\u2019s \u201ccommon sense\u201d\nassumptions apply outside of Kansas is thus open to challenge.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*Vehicle stops \u201cinterfere with freedom of\nmovement, are inconvenient, and consume time.\u201dProuse, 440\nU.\u00a0S., at 657. Worse still, they \u201cmay create substantial\nanxiety\u201d through an \u201cunsettling show of authority.\u201dIbid.Before subjecting motorists to this type of investigation, the\nState must possess articulable facts and officer inferences to form\nsuspicion. The State below left unexplained key components of the\nreasonable-suspicion inquiry. In an effort to uphold the\nconviction, the Court destroys Fourth Amendment jurisprudence that\nrequires individualized suspicion. I respectfully dissent.Notes1Cortezexplained\nwhy this is so. Law enforcement officers, behaving akin to \u201cjurors\nas factfinders,\u201d have \u201cformulated certain commonsense conclusions\nabout human behavior\u201d as it relates to \u201cthe field of law\nenforcement.\u201d 449 U.\u00a0S., at 418. A trained officer thus \u201cdraws\ninferences and makes deductions\u2014inferences and deductions that\nmight well elude an untrained person.\u201dIbid.; see alsoUnited Statesv.Arvizu,534\nU.S. 266, 276 (2002) (crediting officer assessment of driver\nbehavior that was based on \u201chis specialized training and\nfamiliarity with the customs of the area\u2019s\ninhabitants\u201d).2The majority suggests that\nrequiring the State to supply the missing link between fact and\nsuspicion would \u201cconsiderably narrow the daylight\u201d between the\nreasonable-suspicion showing and that required to establish\nprobable cause.Ante, at 7. But that may simply be a feature\nof this unique context, where the difference between a permissible\nand impermissible stop turns on a single fact. Given that\nreasonable suspicion and probable cause are not \u201creducible to\n\u2018precise definition or quantification,\u2019\u00a0\u201dFloridav.Harris,568 U.S.\n237, 243 (2013), the gradation between the two is bound to vary\nfrom case to case.",
