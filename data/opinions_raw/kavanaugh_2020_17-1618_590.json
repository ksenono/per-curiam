HARRIS FUNERAL HOMES,\nINC., PETITIONER18\u2013107v.EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY\nCOMMISSION, et\u00a0al.on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the sixth circuit[June 15, 2020]Justice Kavanaugh, dissenting.Like many cases in this Court, this case boils\ndown to one fundamental question: Who decides? Title VII of the\nCivil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits employment discrimination\n\u201cbecause of\u00a0\u201d an individual\u2019s \u201crace, color, religion, sex, or\nnational origin.\u201d The question here is whether Title VII should be\nexpanded to prohibit employment discrimination because of sexual\norientation. Under the Constitution\u2019s separation of powers, the\nresponsibility to amend Title VII belongs to Congress and the\nPresident in the legislative process, not to this Court.The political branches are well aware of this\nissue. In 2007, the U.\u00a0S. House of Representatives voted 235\nto 184 to prohibit employment discrimination on the basis of sexual\norientation. In 2013, the U.\u00a0S. Senate voted 64 to 32 in favor\nof a similar ban. In 2019, the House again voted 236 to 173 to\noutlaw employment discrimination on the basis of sexual\norientation. Although both the House and Senate have voted at\ndifferent times to prohibit sexual orientation discrimination, the\ntwo Houses have not yet come together with the President to enact a\nbill into law.The policy arguments for amending Title VII are\nvery weighty. The Court has previously stated, and I fully agree,\nthat gay and lesbian Americans \u201ccannot be treated as social\noutcasts or as inferior in dignity and worth.\u201dMasterpiece\nCakeshop, Ltd.v.Colorado Civil Rights Comm\u2019n, 584\nU.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2018) (slip op., at 9).But we are judges, not Members of Congress. And\nin Alexander Hamilton\u2019s words, federal judges exercise \u201cneither\nForce nor Will, but merely judgment.\u201d The Federalist No. 78, p. 523\n(J. Cooke ed. 1961). Under the Constitution\u2019s separation of powers,\nour role as judges is to interpret and follow the law as written,\nregardless of whether we like the result. Cf.Texasv.Johnson,491 U.S.\n397, 420\u2013421 (1989) (Kennedy, J., concurring). Our role is not\nto make or amend the law. As written, Title VII does not prohibit\nemployment discrimination because of sexual orientation.[1]ITitle VII makes it unlawful for employers to\ndiscriminate because of \u201crace, color, religion, sex, or national\norigin.\u201d 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72000e\u20132(a)(1).[2] As enacted in 1964, Title VII did not prohibit\nother forms of employment discrimination, such as age\ndiscrimination, disability discrimination, or sexual orientation\ndiscrimination.Over time, Congress has enacted new employment\ndiscrimination laws. In 1967, Congress passed and President Johnson\nsigned the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. 81Stat. 602. In\n1973, Congress passed and President Nixon signed the Rehabilitation\nAct, which in substance prohibited disability discrimination\nagainst federal and certain other employees. 87Stat. 355. In 1990,\nCongress passed and President George H. W. Bush signed the\ncomprehensive Americans with Disabilities Act. 104Stat. 327.To prohibit age discrimination and disability\ndiscrimination, this Court did not unilaterally rewrite or update\nthe law. Rather, Congress and the President enacted new\nlegislation, as prescribed by the Constitution\u2019s separation of\npowers.For several decades, Congress has considered\nnumerous bills to prohibit employment discrimination based on\nsexual orientation. But as noted above, although Congress has come\nclose, it has not yet shouldered a bill over the legislative finish\nline.In the face of the unsuccessful legislative\nefforts (so far) to prohibit sexual orientation discrimination,\njudges may not rewrite the law simply because of their own policy\nviews. Judges may not update the law merely because they think that\nCongress does not have the votes or the fortitude. Judges may not\npredictively amend the law just because they believe that Congress\nis likely to do it soon anyway.If judges could rewrite laws based on their own\npolicy views, or based on their own assessments of likely future\nlegislative action, the critical distinction between legislative\nauthority and judicial authority that undergirds the Constitution\u2019s\nseparation of powers would collapse, thereby threatening the\nimpartial rule of law and individual liberty. As James Madison\nstated: \u201cWere the power of judging joined with the legislative, the\nlife and liberty of the subject would be exposed to arbitrary\ncontroul, forthejudgewould then bethe\nlegislator.\u201d The Federalist No. 47, at 326 (citing\nMontesquieu). If judges could, for example, rewrite or update\nsecurities laws or healthcare laws or gun laws or environmental\nlaws simply based on their own policy views, the Judiciary would\nbecome a democratically illegitimate super-legislature\u2014unelected,\nand hijacking the important policy decisions reserved by the\nConstitution to the people\u2019s elected representatives.Because judges interpret the law as written, not\nas they might wish it were written, the first 10 U.\u00a0S. Courts\nof Appeals to consider whether Title VII prohibits sexual\norientation discrimination all said no. Some 30 federal judges\nconsidered the question. All 30 judges said no, based on the text\nof the statute. 30 out of 30.But in the last few years, a new theory has\nemerged. To end-run the bedrock separation-of-powers principle that\ncourts may not unilaterally rewrite statutes, the plaintiffs here\n(and, recently, two Courts of Appeals) have advanced a novel and\ncreative argument. They contend that discrimination \u201cbecause of\nsexual orientation\u201d and discrimination \u201cbecause of sex\u201d are\nactually not separate categories of discrimination after all.\nInstead, the theory goes, discrimination because of sexual\norientation always qualifies as discrimination because of sex: When\na gay man is fired because he is gay, he is fired because he is\nattracted to men, even though a similarly situated woman would not\nbe fired just because she is attracted to men. According to this\ntheory, it follows that the man has been fired, at least as a\nliteral matter, because of his sex.Under this literalist approach, sexual\norientation discrimination automatically qualifies as sex\ndiscrimination, and Title VII\u2019s prohibition against sex\ndiscrimination therefore also prohibits sexual orientation\ndiscrimination\u2014and actually has done so since 1964, unbeknownst to\neveryone. Surprisingly, the Court today buys into this approach.Ante, at 9\u201312.For the sake of argument, I will assume that\nfiring someone because of their sexual orientation may, as a very\nliteral matter, entail making a distinction based on sex. But to\nprevail in this case with their literalist approach, the plaintiffs\nmustalsoestablish one of two other points. The plaintiffs\nmust establish that courts, when interpreting a statute, adhere to\nliteral meaning rather than ordinary meaning. Or alternatively, the\nplaintiffs must establish that the ordinary meaning of\n\u201cdiscriminate because of sex\u201d\u2014not just the literal\nmeaning\u2014encompasses sexual orientation discrimination. The\nplaintiffs fall short on both counts.First, courts must follow ordinary\nmeaning, not literal meaning. And courts must adhere to the\nordinary meaning of phrases, not just the meaning of the words in a\nphrase.There is no serious debate about the\nfoundational interpretive principle that courts adhere to ordinary\nmeaning, not literal meaning, when interpreting statutes. As\nJustice Scalia explained, \u201cthe good textualist is not a\nliteralist.\u201d A. Scalia, A Matter of Interpretation 24 (1997). Or as\nProfessor Eskridge stated: The \u201cprime directive in statutory\ninterpretation is to apply the meaning that a reasonable reader\nwould derive from the text of the law,\u201d so that \u201cfor hard cases as\nwell as easy ones, theordinary meaning(or the \u2018everyday\nmeaning\u2019 or the \u2018commonsense\u2019 reading) of the relevant statutory\ntext is the anchor for statutory interpretation.\u201d W. Eskridge,\nInterpreting Law 33, 34\u201335 (2016) (footnote omitted). Or as\nProfessor Manning put it, proper statutory interpretation asks \u201chow\na reasonable person, conversant with the relevant social and\nlinguistic conventions, would read the text in context. This\napproach recognizes that the literal or dictionary definitions of\nwords will often fail to account for settled nuances or background\nconventions that qualify the literal meaning of language and, in\nparticular, of legal language.\u201d Manning, The Absurdity Doctrine,\n116 Harv. L.\u00a0Rev. 2387, 2392\u20132393 (2003). Or as Professor\nNelson wrote: No \u201cmainstream judge is interested solely in the\nliteral definitions of a statute\u2019s words.\u201d Nelson, What Is\nTextualism?, 91 Va. L.\u00a0Rev. 347, 376 (2005). The ordinary\nmeaning that counts is the ordinary public meaning at the time of\nenactment\u2014although in this case, that temporal principle matters\nlittle because the ordinary meaning of \u201cdiscriminate because of\nsex\u201d was the same in 1964 as it is now.Judges adhere to ordinary meaning for two main\nreasons: rule of law and democratic accountability. A society\ngoverned by the rule of law must have laws that are known and\nunderstandable to the citizenry. And judicial adherence to ordinary\nmeaning facilitates the democratic accountability of America\u2019s\nelected representatives for the laws they enact. Citizens and\nlegislators must be able to ascertain the law by reading the words\nof the statute. Both the rule of law and democratic accountability\nbadly suffer when a court adopts a hidden or obscure interpretation\nof the law, and not its ordinary meaning.Consider a simple example of how ordinary\nmeaning differs from literal meaning. A statutory ban on \u201cvehicles\nin the park\u201d would literally encompass a baby stroller. But no good\njudge would interpret the statute that way because the word\n\u201cvehicle,\u201d in its ordinary meaning, does not encompass baby\nstrollers.The ordinary meaning principle is longstanding\nand well settled. Time and again, this Court has rejected\nliteralism in favor of ordinary meaning. Take a few examples:The Court recognized that beans may be seeds \u201cin\nthe language of botany or natural history,\u201d but concluded that\nbeans are not seeds \u201cin commerce\u201d or \u201cin common parlance.\u201dRobertsonv.Salomon,130 U.S.\n412, 414 (1889).The Court explained that tomatoes are literally\n\u201cthe fruit of a vine,\u201d but \u201cin the common language of the people,\u201d\ntomatoes are vegetables.Nixv.Hedden,149 U.S.\n304, 307 (1893).The Court stated that the statutory term\n\u201cvehicle\u201d does not cover an aircraft: \u201cNo doubt etymologically it\nis possible to use the word to signify a conveyance working on\nland, water or air .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. But in everyday speech\n\u2018vehicle\u2019 calls up the picture of a thing moving on land.\u201dMcBoylev.United States,283 U.S.\n25, 26 (1931).The Court pointed out that \u201cthis Court\u2019s\ninterpretation of the three-judge-court statutes has frequently\ndeviated from the path of literalism.\u201dGonzalezv.Automatic Employees Credit Union,419 U.S.\n90, 96 (1974).The Court refused a reading of \u201cmineral\ndeposits\u201d that would include water, even if \u201cwater is a \u2018mineral,\u2019\nin the broadest sense of that word,\u201d because it would bring about a\n\u201cmajor .\u00a0.\u00a0. alteration in established legal\nrelationships based on nothing more than an overly literal reading\nof a statute, without any regard for its context or history.\u201dAndrusv.Charlestone Stone Products Co.,436 U.S.\n604, 610, 616 (1978).The Court declined to interpret \u201cfacilitating\u201d a\ndrug distribution crime in a way that would cover purchasing drugs,\nbecause the \u201cliteral sweep of \u2018facilitate\u2019 sits uncomfortably with\ncommon usage.\u201dAbuelhawav.United States,556 U.S.\n816, 820 (2009).The Court rebuffed a literal reading of\n\u201cpersonnel rules\u201d that would encompass any rules that personnel\nmust follow (as opposed to human resources rulesaboutpersonnel), and stated that no one \u201cusing ordinary language would\ndescribe\u201d personnel rules \u201cin this manner.\u201dMilnerv.Department of Navy,562 U.S.\n562, 578 (2011).The Court explained that, when construing\nstatutory phrases such as \u201carising from,\u201d it avoids \u201cuncritical\nliteralism leading to results that no sensible person could have\nintended.\u201dJenningsv.Rodriguez, 583 U.\u00a0S. ___,\n___\u2013___ (2018) (plurality opinion) (slip op., at 9\u201310) (internal\nquotation marks omitted).Those cases exemplify a deeply rooted\nprinciple: When there is a divide between the literal meaning and\nthe ordinary meaning, courts must follow the ordinary meaning.Next is a critical point of emphasis in this\ncase. The difference between literal and ordinary meaning becomes\nespecially important when\u2014as in this case\u2014judges considerphrasesin statutes. (Recall that the shorthand version of\nthe phrase at issue here is \u201cdiscriminate because of\nsex.\u201d)[3] Courts must heed the\nordinary meaning of thephraseas a whole, not just\nthe meaning of the words in the phrase. That is because a phrase\nmay have a more precise or confined meaning than the literal\nmeaning of the individual words in the phrase. Examples abound. An\n\u201cAmerican flag\u201d could literally encompass a flag made in America,\nbut in common parlance it denotes the Stars and Stripes. A\n\u201cthree-pointer\u201d could literally include a field goal in football,\nbut in common parlance, it is a shot from behind the arc in\nbasketball. A \u201ccold war\u201d could literally mean any wintertime war,\nbut in common parlance it signifies a conflict short of open\nwarfare. A \u201cwashing machine\u201d could literally refer to any machine\nused for washing any item, but in everyday speech it means a\nmachine for washing clothes.This Court has often emphasized the importance\nof sticking to the ordinary meaningof a phrase, rather than\nthe meaning of words in the phrase. InFCCv.AT&T\nInc.,562 U.S.\n397(2011), for example, the Court explained:\u201cAT&T\u2019s argument treats the term\n\u2018personal privacy\u2019 as simply the sum of its two words: the privacy\nof a person.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. But two words together may assume\na more particular meaning than those words in isolation. We\nunderstand a golden cup to be a cup made of or resembling gold. A\ngolden boy, on the other hand, is one who is charming, lucky, and\ntalented. A golden opportunity is one not to be missed. \u2018Personal\u2019\nin the phrase \u2018personal privacy\u2019 conveys more than just \u2018of a\nperson.\u2019 It suggests a type of privacy evocative of human\nconcerns\u2014not the sort usually associated with an entity like, say,\nAT&T.\u201dId.,at 406.Exactly right and exactly on point in this\ncase.Justice Scalia explained the extraordinary\nimportance of hewing to the ordinary meaning of a phrase: \u201cAdhering\nto thefair meaningof the text (the textualist\u2019s\ntouchstone) does not limit one to the hyperliteral meaning of each\nword in the text. In the words of Learned Hand: \u2018a sterile\nliteralism .\u00a0.\u00a0. loses sight of the forest for the\ntrees.\u2019 The full body of a text contains implications that can\nalter the literal meaning of individual words.\u201d A. Scalia & B.\nGarner, Reading Law 356 (2012) (footnote omitted). Put another way,\n\u201cthe meaning of a sentence may be more than that of the separate\nwords, as a melody is more than the notes.\u201dHelveringv.Gregory, 69 F.2d 809, 810\u2013811 (CA2 1934) (L. Hand, J.).\nJudges must take care to follow ordinary meaning \u201cwhen two words\ncombine to produce a meaning that is not the mechanical composition\nof the two words separately.\u201d Eskridge, Interpreting Law, at 62.\nDictionaries are not \u201calways useful for determining the ordinary\nmeaning of word clusters (like \u2018driving a vehicle\u2019) or phrases and\nclauses or entire sentences.\u201dId., at 44. And we must\nrecognize that a phrase can cover a \u201cdramatically smaller category\nthan either component term.\u201dId.,at 62.If the usual evidence indicates that a statutory\nphrase bears an ordinary meaning different from the literal\nstrung-together definitions of the individual words in the phrase,\nwe may not ignore or gloss over that discrepancy. \u201cLegislation\ncannot sensibly be interpreted by stringing together dictionary\nsynonyms of each word and proclaiming that, if the right example of\nthe meaning of each is selected, the \u2018plain meaning\u2019 of the statute\nleads to a particular result. No theory of interpretation,\nincluding textualism itself, is premised on such an approach.\u201d 883\nF.3d 100, 144, n.\u00a07 (CA2 2018) (Lynch, J.,\ndissenting).[4]In other words, this Court\u2019s precedents and\nlongstanding principles of statutory interpretation teach a clear\nlesson: Do not simply split statutory phrases into their component\nwords, look up each in a dictionary, and then mechanically put them\ntogether again, as the majority opinion today mistakenly does. Seeante, at 5\u20139. To reiterate Justice Scalia\u2019s caution, that\napproach misses the forest for the trees.A literalist approach to interpreting phrases\ndisrespects ordinary meaning and deprives the citizenry of fair\nnotice of what the law is. It destabilizes the rule of law and\nthwarts democratic accountability. For phrases as well as terms,\nthe \u201clinchpin of statutory interpretation isordinary\nmeaning, for that is going to be most accessible to the\ncitizenry desirous of following the lawandto the\nlegislators and their staffs drafting the legal terms of the plans\nlaunched by statutesandto the administrators and judges\nimplementing the statutory plan.\u201d Eskridge, Interpreting\nLaw,at 81; see Scalia, A Matter of Interpretation, at\n17.Bottom line: Statutory Interpretation 101\ninstructs courts to follow ordinary meaning, not literal meaning,\nand to adhere to the ordinary meaning of phrases, not just the\nmeaning of the words in a phrase.Second, in light of the bedrock principle\nthat we must adhere to the ordinary meaning of a phrase, the\nquestion in this case boils down to the ordinary meaning of the\nphrase \u201cdiscriminate because of sex.\u201d Does the ordinary meaning of\nthat phrase encompass discrimination because of sexual orientation?\nThe answer is plainly no.On occasion, it can be difficult for judges to\nassess ordinary meaning. Not here. Both common parlance and common\nlegal usage treat sex discrimination and sexual orientation\ndiscrimination as two distinct categories of discrimination\u2014back in\n1964 and still today.As to common parlance, few in 1964 (or today)\nwould describe a firing because of sexual orientation as a firing\nbecause of sex. As commonly understood, sexual orientation\ndiscrimination is distinct from, and not a form of, sex\ndiscrimination. The majority opinion acknowledges the common\nunderstanding, noting that the plaintiffs here probably did not\ntell their friends that they were fired because of their sex.Ante, at 16. That observation is clearly correct. In common\nparlance, Bostock and Zarda were fired because they were gay, not\nbecause they were men.Contrary to the majority opinion\u2019s approach\ntoday, this Court has repeatedly emphasized that common parlance\nmatters in assessing the ordinary meaning of a statute, because\ncourts heed how \u201cmost people\u201d \u201cwould have understood\u201d the text of a\nstatute when enacted.New Prime Inc.v.Oliveira, 586\nU.\u00a0S. ___, ___\u2013___ (2019) (slip op., at 6\u20137); seeHensonv.Santander Consumer USA Inc., 582 U.\u00a0S.\n___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 4) (using a conversation between\nfriends to demonstrate ordinary meaning); see alsoWisconsin\nCentral Ltd.v.United States, 585 U.\u00a0S. ___,\n___\u2013___ (2018) (slip op., at 2\u20133) (similar);AT&T, 562\nU.\u00a0S., at 403\u2013404 (similar).Consider the employer who has four employees but\nmust fire two of them for financial reasons. Suppose the four\nemployees are a straight man, a straight woman, a gay man, and a\nlesbian. The employer with animosity against women (animosity based\non sex) will fire the two women. The employer with animosity\nagainst gays (animosity based on sexual orientation) will fire the\ngay man and the lesbian. Those are two distinct harms caused by two\ndistinct biases that have two different outcomes. To treat one as a\nform of the other\u2014as the majority opinion does\u2014misapprehends common\nlanguage, human psychology, and real life. SeeHivelyv.Ivy Tech Community Collegeof Ind., 853 F.3d 339, 363\n(CA7 2017) (Sykes, J., dissenting).It also rewrites history. Seneca Falls was not\nStonewall. The women\u2019s rights movement was not (and is not) the gay\nrights movement, although many people obviously support or\nparticipate in both. So to think that sexual orientation\ndiscrimination is just a form of sex discrimination is not just a\nmistake of language and psychology, but also a mistake of history\nand sociology.Importantly, an overwhelming body of federal law\nreflects and reinforces the ordinary meaning and demonstrates that\nsexual orientation discrimination is distinct from, and not a form\nof, sex discrimination. Since enacting Title VII in 1964, Congress\nhasnevertreated sexual orientation discrimination the same\nas, or as a form of, sex discrimination. Instead, Congress has\nconsistently treated sex discrimination and sexual orientation\ndiscrimination as legally distinct categories of\ndiscrimination.Many federal statutes prohibit sex\ndiscrimination, and many federal statutes also prohibit sexual\norientation discrimination. But those sexual orientation statutes\nexpressly prohibit sexual orientation discrimination in addition to\nexpressly prohibiting sex discrimination.Every single one.To this day, Congress has never defined sex discrimination to\nencompass sexual orientation discrimination. Instead, when Congress\nwants to prohibit sexual orientation discrimination in addition to\nsex discrimination, Congress explicitly refers to sexual\norientation discrimination.[5]That longstanding and widespread congressional\npractice matters. When interpreting statutes, as the Court has\noften said, we \u201cusually presume differences in language\u201d convey\n\u201cdifferences in meaning.\u201dWisconsin Central, 585 U.\u00a0S.,\nat ___ (slip op., at 4) (internal quotation marks omitted). When\nCongress chooses distinct phrases to accomplish distinct purposes,\nand does so over and over again for decades, we may not lightly\ntoss aside all of Congress\u2019s careful handiwork. As Justice Scalia\nexplained for the Court, \u201cit is not our function\u201d to \u201ctreat alike\nsubjects that different Congresses have chosen to treat\ndifferently.\u201dWest Virginia Univ. Hospitals, Inc.v.Casey,499 U.S.\n83, 101 (1991); seeid.,at 92.And the Court has likewise stressed that we may\nnot read \u201ca specific concept into general words when precise\nlanguage in other statutes reveals that Congress knew how to\nidentify that concept.\u201d Eskridge, Interpreting Law, at 415; seeUniversity of Tex. Southwestern Medical Centerv.Nassar,570 U.S.\n338, 357 (2013);Arlington Central School Dist. Bd. of\nEd.v.Murphy,548 U.S.\n291, 297\u2013298 (2006);Jamav.Immigration and Customs\nEnforcement,543 U.S.\n335, 341\u2013342 (2005);Custisv.United States,511 U.S.\n485, 491\u2013493 (1994);West Virginia Univ. Hospitals, 499\nU.\u00a0S., at 99.So it is here. As demonstrated by all of the\nstatutes covering sexual orientation discrimination, Congress knows\nhow to prohibit sexual orientation discrimination. So courts should\nnot read that specific concept into the general words \u201cdiscriminate\nbecause of sex.\u201d We cannot close our eyes to the indisputable fact\nthat Congress\u2014for several decades in a large number of statutes\u2014has\nidentified sex discrimination and sexual orientation discrimination\nas two distinct categories.Where possible, we also strive to interpret\nstatutes so as not to create undue surplusage. It is not uncommon\nto find some scattered redundancies in statutes. But reading sex\ndiscrimination to encompass sexual orientation discrimination would\ncast aside as surplusage the numerous references to sexual\norientation discrimination sprinkled throughout the U.\u00a0S. Code\nin laws enacted over the last 25 years.In short, an extensive body of federal law both\nreflects and reinforces the widespread understanding that sexual\norientation discrimination is distinct from, and not a form of, sex\ndiscrimination.The story is the same with bills proposed in\nCongress. Since the 1970s, Members of Congress have introduced many\nbills to prohibit sexual orientation discrimination in the\nworkplace. Until very recently, all of those bills would have\nexpressly established sexual orientation as a separately proscribed\ncategory of discrimination. The bills did not define sex\ndiscrimination to encompass sexual orientation\ndiscrimination.[6]The proposed bills are telling not because they\nare relevant to congressional intent regarding Title VII. SeeCentral Bank of Denver, N.\u00a0A.v.First Interstate\nBank of Denver, N.\u00a0A.,511 U.S.\n164, 186\u2013188 (1994). Rather, the proposed bills are telling\nbecause they, like the enacted laws, further demonstrate the\nwidespread usage of the English language in the United States:\nSexual orientation discrimination is distinct from, and not a form\nof, sex discrimination.Presidential Executive Orders reflect that same\ncommon understanding. In 1967, President Johnson signed an\nExecutive Order prohibiting sex discrimination in federal\nemployment. In 1969, President Nixon issued a new order that did\nthe same. Exec. Order No. 11375, 3 CFR 684 (1966\u20131970 Comp.); Exec.\nOrder No. 11478,id.,at 803. In 1998, President Clinton\ncharted a new path and signed an Executive Order prohibiting sexual\norientation discrimination in federal employment. Exec. Order No.\n13087, 3 CFR 191 (1999). The Nixon and Clinton Executive Orders\nremain in effect today.Like the relevant federal statutes, the 1998\nClinton Executive Order expressly added sexual orientation as a\nnew, separately prohibited form of discrimination. As Judge Lynch\ncogently spelled out, \u201cthe Clinton Administration did not argue\nthat the prohibition of sex discrimination in\u201d the prior 1969\nExecutive Order \u201calready banned, or henceforth would be deemed to\nban, sexual orientation discrimination.\u201d 883 F.\u00a03d, at 152,\nn.\u00a022 (dissenting opinion). In short, President Clinton\u2019s 1998\nExecutive Order indicates that the Executive Branch, like Congress,\nhas long understood sexual orientation discrimination to be\ndistinct from, and not a form of, sex discrimination.Federal regulations likewise reflect that same\nunderstanding. The Office of Personnel Management is the federal\nagency that administers and enforces personnel rules across the\nFederal Government. OPM has issued regulations that \u201cgovern\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. the employment practices of the Federal Government\ngenerally, and of individual agencies.\u201d 5 CFR \u00a7\u00a7300.101, 300.102\n(2019). Like the federal statutes and the Presidential Executive\nOrders, those OPM regulations separately prohibit sex\ndiscrimination and sexual orientation discrimination.The States have proceeded in the same fashion. A\nmajority of States prohibit sexual orientation discrimination in\nemployment, either by legislation applying to most\nworkers,[7] an executive order\napplying to public employees,[8] or both. Almost every state statute or executive order\nproscribing sexual orientation discrimination expressly prohibits\nsexual orientation discrimination separately from the State\u2019s ban\non sex discrimination.That common usage in the States underscores that\nsexual orientation discrimination is commonly understood as a legal\nconcept distinct from sex discrimination.And it is the common understanding in this Court\nas well. Since 1971, the Court has employed rigorous or heightened\nconstitutional scrutiny of laws that classify on the basis of sex.\nSeeUnited Statesv.Virginia,518 U.S.\n515, 531\u2013533 (1996);J.E.B.v.Alabama ex\u00a0rel. T.\u00a0B.,511\nU.S. 127, 136\u2013137 (1994);Craigv.Boren,429 U.S.\n190, 197\u2013199 (1976);Frontierov.Richardson,411 U.S.\n677, 682\u2013684 (1973) (plurality opinion);Reedv.Reed,404 U.S.\n71, 75\u201377 (1971). Over the last several decades, the Court has\nalso decided many cases involving sexual orientation. But in those\ncases, the Court never suggested that sexual orientation\ndiscrimination is just a form of sex discrimination. All of the\nCourt\u2019s cases fromBowerstoRomertoLawrencetoWindsortoObergefellwould have been far easier\nto analyze and decide if sexual orientation discrimination were\njust a form of sex discrimination and therefore received the same\nheightened scrutiny as sex discrimination under the Equal\nProtection Clause. SeeBowersv.Hardwick,478 U.S.\n186(1986);Romerv.Evans,517 U.S.\n620(1996);Lawrencev.Texas,539 U.S.\n558(2003);United Statesv.Windsor,570 U.S.\n744(2013);Obergefellv.Hodges, 576 U.S. 644\n(2015).Did the Court in all of those sexual orientation\ncases just miss that obvious answer\u2014and overlook the fact that\nsexual orientation discrimination is actually a form of sex\ndiscrimination? That seems implausible. Nineteen Justices have\nparticipated in those cases. Not a single Justice stated or even\nhinted that sexual orientation discrimination was just a form of\nsex discrimination and therefore entitled to the same heightened\nscrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause. The opinions in those\nfive cases contain no trace of such reasoning. That is presumably\nbecause everyone on this Court, too, has long understood that\nsexual orientation discrimination is distinct from, and not a form\nof, sex discrimination.In sum, all of the usual indicators of ordinary\nmeaning\u2014common parlance, common usage by Congress, the practice in\nthe Executive Branch, the laws in the States, and the decisions of\nthis Court\u2014overwhelmingly establish that sexual orientation\ndiscrimination is distinct from, and not a form of, sex\ndiscrimination. The usage has been consistent across decades, in\nboth the federal and state contexts.Judge Sykes summarized the law and language this\nway: \u201cTo a fluent speaker of the English language\u2014then and\nnow\u2014.\u00a0.\u00a0. discrimination \u2018because of sex\u2019 is not\nreasonably understood to include discrimination based on sexual\norientation, a different immutable characteristic. Classifying\npeople by sexual orientation is different than classifying them by\nsex. The two traits are categorically distinct and widely\nrecognized as such. There is no ambiguity or vagueness here.\u201dHively, 853 F.\u00a03d, at 363 (dissenting opinion).To tie it all together, the plaintiffs have only\ntwo routes to succeed here. Either they can say that literal\nmeaning overrides ordinary meaning when the two conflict. Or they\ncan say that the ordinary meaning of the phrase \u201cdiscriminate\nbecause of sex\u201d encompasses sexual orientation discrimination. But\nthe first flouts long-settled principles of statutory\ninterpretation. And the second contradicts the widespread ordinary\nuse of the English language in America.IIUntil the last few years, every U.\u00a0S.\nCourt of Appeals to address this question concluded that Title VII\ndoes not prohibit discrimination because of sexual orientation. As\nnoted above, in the first 10 Courts of Appeals to consider the\nissue, all 30 federal judges agreed that Title VII does not\nprohibit sexual orientation discrimination. 30 out of 30\njudges.[9]The unanimity of those 30 federal judges shows\nthat the question as a matter of law, as compared to as a matter of\npolicy, was not deemed close. Those 30 judges realized a seemingly\nobvious point: Title VII is not a general grant of authority for\njudges to fashion an evolving common law of equal treatment in the\nworkplace. Rather, Title VII identifies certain specific categories\nof prohibited discrimination. And under the separation of powers,\nCongress\u2014not the courts\u2014possesses the authority to amend or update\nthe law, as Congress has done with age discrimination and\ndisability discrimination, for example.So what changed from the situation only a few\nyears ago when 30 out of 30 federal judges had agreed on this\nquestion? Not the text of Title VII. The law has not changed.\nRather, the judges\u2019 decisions have evolved.To be sure, the majority opinion today does not\nopenly profess that it is judicially updating or amending Title\nVII. Cf.Hively, 853 F.\u00a03d, at 357 (Posner, J.,\nconcurring). But the majority opinion achieves the same outcome by\nseizing on literal meaning and overlooking the ordinary meaning of\nthe phrase \u201cdiscriminate because of sex.\u201d Although the majority\nopinion acknowledges that the meaning of a phrase and the meaning\nof a phrase\u2019s individual wordscoulddiffer, it dismisses\nphrasal meaning for purposes of this case. The majority opinion\nrepeatedly seizes on the meaning of the statute\u2019s individual terms,\nmechanically puts them back together, and generates an\ninterpretation of the phrase \u201cdiscriminate because of sex\u201d that is\nliteral. Seeante, at 5\u20139, 17, 24\u201326. But to reiterate, that\napproach to statutory interpretation is fundamentally flawed.\nBedrock principles of statutory interpretation dictate that we look\nto ordinary meaning, not literal meaning, and that we likewise\nadhere to the ordinary meaning of phrases, not just the meaning of\nwords in a phrase. And the ordinary meaning of the phrase\n\u201cdiscriminate because of sex\u201d does not encompass sexual orientation\ndiscrimination.The majority opinion deflects that critique by\nsaying that courts should base their interpretation of statutes on\nthe text as written, not on the legislators\u2019 subjective intentions.Ante, at 20, 23\u201330. Of course that is true. No one\ndisagrees. It is \u201cthe provisions of our laws rather than the\nprincipal concerns of our legislators by which we are governed.\u201dOncalev.Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc.,523 U.S.\n75, 79 (1998).But in my respectful view, the majority opinion\nmakes a fundamental mistake by confusing ordinary meaning with\nsubjective intentions. To briefly explain: In the early years after\nTitle VII was enacted, some may have wondered whether Title VII\u2019s\nprohibition on sex discrimination protected male employees. After\nall, covering male employees may not have been the intent of some\nwho voted for the statute. Nonetheless, discrimination on the basis\nof sex against women and discrimination on the basis of sex against\nmen are both understood as discrimination because of sex (back in\n1964 and now) and are therefore encompassed within Title VII. Cf.id.,at 78\u201379; seeNewport News Shipbuilding & Dry\nDock Co.v.EEOC,462 U.S.\n669, 682\u2013685 (1983). So too, regardless of what the intentions\nof the drafters might have been, the ordinary meaning of the law\ndemonstrates that harassing an employee because of her sex is\ndiscriminating against the employee because of her sex with respect\nto the \u201cterms, conditions, or privileges of employment,\u201d as this\nCourt rightly concluded.Meritor Savings Bank, FSBv.Vinson,477 U.S.\n57, 64 (1986) (internal quotation marks omitted).[10]By contrast, this case involves sexual\norientation discrimination, which has long and widely been\nunderstood as distinct from, and not a form of, sex discrimination.\nUntil now, federal law has always reflected that common usage and\nrecognized that distinction between sex discrimination and sexual\norientation discrimination. To fire one employee because she is a\nwoman and another employee because he is gay implicates two\ndistinct societal concerns, reveals two distinct biases, imposes\ntwo distinct harms, and falls within two distinct statutory\nprohibitions.To be sure, as Judge Lynch appropriately\nrecognized, it is \u201cunderstandable\u201d that those seeking legal\nprotection for gay people \u201csearch for innovative arguments to\nclassify workplace bias against gays as a form of discrimination\nthat is already prohibited by federal law. But the arguments\nadvanced by the majority ignore the evident meaning of the language\nof Title VII, the social realities that distinguish between the\nkinds of biases that the statute sought to exclude from the\nworkplace from those it did not, and the distinctive nature of\nanti-gay prejudice.\u201d 883 F.\u00a03d, at 162 (dissenting\nopinion).The majority opinion insists that it is not\nrewriting or updating Title VII, but instead is just humbly reading\nthe text of the statute as written. But that assertion is tough to\naccept. Most everyone familiar with the use of the English language\nin America understands that the ordinary meaning of sexual\norientation discrimination is distinct from the ordinary meaning of\nsex discrimination. Federal law distinguishes the two. State law\ndistinguishes the two. This Court\u2019s cases distinguish the two.\nStatistics on discrimination distinguish the two. History\ndistinguishes the two. Psychology distinguishes the two. Sociology\ndistinguishes the two. Human resources departments all over America\ndistinguish the two. Sports leagues distinguish the two. Political\ngroups distinguish the two. Advocacy groups distinguish the two.\nCommon parlance distinguishes the two. Common sense distinguishes\nthe two.As a result, many Americans will not buy the\nnovel interpretation unearthed and advanced by the Court today.\nMany will no doubt believe that the Court has unilaterally\nrewritten American vocabulary and American law\u2014a \u201cstatutory\namendment courtesy of unelected judges.\u201dHively, 853\nF.\u00a03d, at 360 (Sykes, J., dissenting). Some will surmise that\nthe Court succumbed to \u201cthe natural desire that beguiles judges\nalong with other human beings into imposing their own views of\ngoodness, truth, and justice upon others.\u201dFurmanv.Georgia,408 U.S.\n238, 467 (1972) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting).I have the greatest, and unyielding, respect for\nmy colleagues and for their good faith. But when this Court usurps\nthe role of Congress, as it does today, the public understandably\nbecomes confused about who the policymakers really are in our\nsystem of separated powers, and inevitably becomes cynical about\nthe oft-repeated aspiration that judges base their decisions on law\nrather than on personal preference. The best way for judges to\ndemonstrate that we are deciding cases based on the ordinary\nmeaning of the law is to walk the walk, even in the hard cases when\nwe might prefer a different policy outcome.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*In judicially rewriting Title VII, the Court\ntoday cashiers an ongoing legislative process, at a time when a new\nlaw to prohibit sexual orientation discrimination was probably\nclose at hand. After all, even back in 2007\u2014a veritable lifetime\nago in American attitudes about sexual orientation\u2014the House voted\n235 to 184 to prohibit sexual orientation discrimination in\nemployment. H.\u00a0R. 3685, 110th Cong., 1st Sess. In 2013, the\nSenate overwhelmingly approved a similar bill, 64 to 32. S. 815,\n113th Cong., 1st Sess. In 2019, the House voted 236 to 173 to amend\nTitle VII to prohibit employment discrimination on the basis of\nsexual orientation. H.\u00a0R. 5, 116th Cong., 1st Sess. It was\ntherefore easy to envision a day, likely just in the next few\nyears, when the House and Senate took historic votes on a bill that\nwould prohibit employment discrimination on the basis of sexual\norientation. It was easy to picture a massive and celebratory\nPresidential signing ceremony in the East Room or on the South\nLawn.It is true that meaningful legislative action\ntakes time\u2014often too much time, especially in the unwieldy morass\non Capitol Hill. But the Constitution does not put the Legislative\nBranch in the \u201cposition of a television quiz show contestant so\nthat when a given period of time has elapsed and a problem remains\nunsolved by them, the federal judiciary may press a buzzer and take\nits turn at fashioning a solution.\u201d Rehnquist, The Notion of a\nLiving Constitution, 54 Texas L.\u00a0Rev. 693, 700 (1976). The\nproper role of the Judiciary in statutory interpretation cases is\n\u201cto apply, not amend, the work of the People\u2019s representatives,\u201d\neven when the judges might think that \u201cCongress should reenter the\nfield and alter the judgments it made in the past.\u201dHenson,\n582 U.\u00a0S., at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 10\u201311).Instead of a hard-earned victory won through the\ndemocratic process, today\u2019s victory is brought about by judicial\ndictate\u2014judges latching on to a novel form of living literalism to\nrewrite ordinary meaning and remake American law. Under the\nConstitution and laws of the United States, this Court is the wrong\nbody to change American law in that way. The Court\u2019s ruling \u201ccomes\nat a great cost to representative self-government.\u201dHively,\n853 F.\u00a03d, at 360 (Sykes, J., dissenting). And the\nimplications of this Court\u2019s usurpation of the legislative process\nwill likely reverberate in unpredictable ways for years to\ncome.Notwithstanding my concern about the Court\u2019s\ntransgression of the Constitution\u2019s separation of powers, it is\nappropriate to acknowledge the important victory achieved today by\ngay and lesbian Americans. Millions of gay and lesbian Americans\nhave worked hard for many decades to achieve equal treatment in\nfact and in law. They have exhibited extraordinary vision,\ntenacity, and grit\u2014battling often steep odds in the legislative and\njudicial arenas, not to mention in their daily lives. They have\nadvanced powerful policy arguments and can take pride in today\u2019s\nresult. Under the Constitution\u2019s separation of powers, however, I\nbelieve that it was Congress\u2019s role, not this Court\u2019s, to amend\nTitle VII. I therefore must respectfully dissent from the Court\u2019s\njudgment.Notes1Although this opinion\ndoes not separately analyze discrimination on the basis of gender\nidentity, this opinion\u2019s legal analysis of discrimination on the\nbasis of sexual orientation would apply in much the same way to\ndiscrimination on the basis of gender identity.2In full, the statute\nprovides: \u201cIt shall be an unlawful employment practice for an\nemployer\u2014 \u201c(1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any\nindividual, or otherwiseto discriminate against any\nindividualwith respect to his compensation, terms, conditions,\nor privileges of employment,because of such individual\u2019s race,\ncolor, religion, sex, or national origin; or \u201c(2) to limit,\nsegregate, or classify his employees or applicants for employment\nin any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of\nemployment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status\nas an employee, because of such individual\u2019s race, color, religion,\nsex, or national origin.\u201d 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72000e\u20132(a)\n(emphasis added). As the Court today recognizes, Title VII contains\nan important exemption for religious organizations. \u00a72000e\u20131(a);\nsee also \u00a72000e\u20132(e). The First Amendment also safeguards the\nemployment decisions of religious employers. SeeHosanna-Tabor\nEvangelical Lutheran Church and Schoolv.EEOC,565 U.S.\n171, 188\u2013195 (2012). So too, the Religious Freedom Restoration\nAct of 1993 exempts employers from federal laws that substantially\nburden the exercise of religion, subject to limited exceptions.\n\u00a72000bb\u20131.3The full phrasing of the\nstatute is provided above in footnote 2. This opinion uses\n\u201cdiscriminate because of sex\u201d as shorthand for \u201cdiscriminate\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. because of .\u00a0.\u00a0. sex.\u201d Also, the\nplaintiffs do not dispute that the ordinary meaning of the\nstatutory phrase \u201cdiscriminate\u201d because of sex is the same as the\nstatutory phrase \u201cto fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any\nindividual\u201d because of sex.4Another longstanding\ncanon of statutory interpretation\u2014the absurdity canon\u2014similarly\nreflects the law\u2019s focus on ordinary meaning rather than literal\nmeaning. That canon tells courts to avoid construing a statute in a\nway that would lead to absurd consequences. The absurdity canon,\nproperly understood, is \u201can implementation of (rather than\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. an exception to) the ordinary meaning rule.\u201d W.\nEskridge, Interpreting Law 72 (2016). \u201cWhat the rule of absurdity\nseeks to do is what all rules of interpretation seek to do:make\nsenseof the text.\u201d A.

See Brief for Anti-Discrimination Scholars asAmici Curiae4. That suggestion is incorrect.Brownis a correct decision as a matter of original public meaning. There\nwere two analytical components ofBrown. One issue was the\nmeaning of \u201cequal protection.\u201d The Court determined that black\nAmericans\u2014like all Americans\u2014have anindividualequal\nprotection right against state discrimination on the basis of race.\n(That point is also directly made inBollingv.Sharpe,347 U.S.\n497, 499\u2013500 (1954).) Separate but equal is not equal. The\nother issue was whether that racial nondiscrimination principle\napplied to public schools, even though public schools did not exist\nin any comparable form in 1868. The answer was yes. The Court\napplied the equal protection principle to public schools in the\nsame way that the Court applies, for example, the First Amendment\nto the Internet and the Fourth Amendment to cars. This case raises\nthe same kind of inquiry as thefirstquestion inBrown. There, the question was what equal protection meant.\nHere, the question is what \u201cdiscriminate because of sex\u201d means. If\nthis case raised the question whether the sex discrimination\nprinciple in Title VII applied to some category of employers\nunknown in 1964, such as to social media companies, it might be a\ncase inBrown\u2019s second category, akin to the question\nwhether the racial nondiscrimination principle applied to public\nschools. But that is not this case.",
