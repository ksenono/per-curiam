S. ____ (2011)SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESNO. 09-525JANUS CAPITAL GROUP, INC., et\u00a0al., PETITIONERSv.FIRST DERIVATIVE TRADERSon writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the fourth circuit[June 13, 2011]Justice Thomas delivered the\nopinion of the Court.This case requires us to\ndetermine whether Janus Capital Management LLC (JCM), a mutual fund\ninvestment adviser, can be held liable in a private action under\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Rule 10b\u20135 for false\nstatements included in its client mutual funds\u2019 prospectuses. Rule\n10b\u20135 prohibits \u201cmak[ing] any untrue statement of a material fact\u201d\nin connection with the purchase or sale of securities. 17 CFR\n\u00a7240.10b\u20135 (2010). We conclude that JCM cannot be held liable\nbecause it did not make the statements in the prospectuses.IJanus Capital Group, Inc. (JCG),\nis a publicly traded company that created the Janus family of\nmutual funds. These mutual funds are organized in a Massachusetts\nbusiness trust, the Janus Investment Fund. Janus Investment Fund\nretained JCG\u2019s wholly owned subsidiary, JCM, to be its investment\nadviser and administrator. JCG and JCM are the petitioners\nhere.Although JCG created Janus\nInvestment Fund, Janus Investment Fund is a separate legal entity\nowned entirely by mutual fund investors. Janus Investment Fund has\nno assets apart from those owned by the investors. JCM provides\nJanus Investment Fund with investment advisory services, which\ninclude \u201cthe management and administrative services necessary for\nthe operation of [Janus] Fun[d],\u201d App. 225a, but the two entities\nmaintain legal independence. At all times relevant to this case,\nall of the officers of Janus Investment Fund were also officers of\nJCM, but only one member of Janus Investment Fund\u2019s board of\ntrustees was associated with JCM. This is more independence than is\nrequired: By statute, up to 60 percent of the board of a mutual\nfund may be composed of \u201cinterested persons.\u201d See 54 Stat. 806, as\namended, 15 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a780a\u201310(a); see also 15 U. S.\u00a0C. A.\n\u00a780a\u20132(a)(19) (2009 ed. and Feb. 2011 Supp.) (defining \u201cinterested\nperson\u201d).As the securities laws require, Janus\nInvestment Fund issued prospectuses describing the investment\nstrategy and operations of its mutual funds to investors. See 15 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a777b(a)(10), 77e(b)(2), 80a\u20138(b), 80a\u20132(a)(31),\n80a\u201329(a)\u2013(b). The prospectuses for several funds represented that\nthe funds were not suitable for market timing and can be read to\nsuggest that JCM would implement policies to curb the\npractice.[Footnote 1] For\nexample, the Janus Mercury Fund prospectus dated February 25, 2002,\nstated that the fund was \u201cnot intended for market timing or\nexcessive trading\u201d and represented that it \u201cmay reject any purchase\nrequest \u2026 if it believes that any combination of trading activity\nis attributable to market timing or is otherwise excessive or\npotentially disruptive to the Fund.\u201d App. 141a. Although market\ntiming is legal, it harms other investors in the mutual fund.In September 2003, the Attorney General of the\nState of New York filed a complaint against JCG and JCM alleging\nthat JCG entered into secret arrangements to permit market timing\nin several funds run by JCM. After the complaint\u2019s allegations\nbecame public, investors withdrew significant amounts of money from\nthe Janus Investment Fund mutual funds.[Footnote 2] Because Janus Investment Fund compensated JCM\nbased on the total value of the funds and JCM\u2019s management fees\ncomprised a significant percentage of JCG\u2019s income, Janus\nInvestment Fund\u2019s loss of value affected JCG\u2019s value as well. JCG\u2019s\nstock price fell nearly 25 percent, from $17.68 on September 2 to\n$13.50 on September 26.Respondent First Derivative Traders (First\nDerivative) represents a class of plaintiffs who owned JCG stock as\nof September 3, 2003. Its complaint asserts claims against JCG and\nJCM for violations of Rule 10b\u20135 and \u00a710(b) of the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 891, as amended, 15 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a778j(b). First Derivative alleges that JCG and JCM \u201ccaused mutual\nfund prospectuses to be issued for Janus mutual funds and made them\navailable to the investing public, which created the misleading\nimpression that [JCG and JCM] would implement measures to curb\nmarket timing in the Janus [mutual funds].\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert.\n60a. \u201cHad the truth been known, Janus [mutual funds] would have\nbeen less attractive to investors, and consequently, [JCG] would\nhave realized lower revenues, so [JCG\u2019s] stock would have traded at\nlower prices.\u201dId., at 72a.First Derivative contends that JCG and JCM\n\u201cmaterially misled the investing public\u201d and that class members\nrelied \u201cupon the integrity of the market price of [JCG] securities\nand market information relating to [JCG and JCM].\u201dId., at\n109a. The complaint also alleges that JCG should be held liable for\nthe acts of JCM as a \u201ccontrolling person\u201d under 15 U. S.\u00a0C. A.\n\u00a778t(a) (Feb. 2011 Supp.) (\u00a720(a) of the Act).The District Court dismissed the complaint for\nfailure to state a claim.[Footnote\n3]In\u00a0re Mutual Funds Inv. Litigation, 487\nF.\u00a0Supp. 2d 618, 620 (D Md. 2007). The Court of Appeals for\nthe Fourth Circuit reversed, holding that First Derivative had\nsufficiently alleged that \u201cJCG and JCM, by participating in the\nwriting and dissemination of the prospectuses,madethe\nmisleading statements contained in the documents.\u201dIn\u00a0re\nMutual Funds Inv. Litigation, 566 F.\u00a03d 111, 121 (2009)\n(emphasis in original). With respect to the element of reliance,\nthe court found that investors would infer that JCM \u201cplayed a role\nin preparing or approving the content of the Janus fund\nprospectuses,\u201did., at 127, but that investors would not\ninfer the same about JCG, which could be liable only as a \u201ccontrol\nperson\u201d of JCM under \u00a720(a).Id., at 128, 129\u2013130.IIWe granted certiorari to address\nwhether JCM can be held liable in a private action under Rule 10b\u20135\nfor false statements included in Janus Investment Fund\u2019s\npro-spectuses. 561 U. S. ___ (2010). Under Rule 10b\u20135, it is\nunlawful for \u201cany person, directly or indirectly, \u2026 [t]o make any\nuntrue statement of a material fact\u201d in connection with the\npurchase or sale of securities. 17 CFR \u00a7240.10b\u20135(b).[Footnote 4] To be liable, therefore, JCM\nmust have \u201cmade\u201d the material misstatements in the prospectuses. We\nhold that it did not.[Footnote\n5]AThe SEC promulgated Rule 10b\u20135\npursuant to authority granted under \u00a710(b) of the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, 15 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a778j(b). Although neither\nRule 10b\u20135 nor \u00a710(b) expressly creates a private right of action,\nthis Court has held that \u201ca private right of action is implied\nunder \u00a710(b).\u201dSuperintendent of Ins. of N.\u00a0Y.v.Bankers Life & Casualty Co.,404 U. S. 6, 13, n.\u00a09\n(1971). That holding \u201cremains the law,\u201dStoneridge Investment\nPartners, LLCv.Scientific-Atlanta, Inc.,552 U. S. 148, 165 (2008), but\n\u201c[c]oncerns with the judicial creation of a private cause of action\ncaution against its expansion,\u201dibid.Thus, in analyzing\nwhether JCM \u201cmade\u201d the statements for purposes of Rule 10b\u20135, we\nare mindful that we must give \u201cnarrow dimensions \u2026 to a right of\naction Congress did not authorize when it first enacted the statute\nand did not expand when it revisited the law.\u201dId.,at\n167.1One \u201cmakes\u201d a statement by\nstating it. When \u201cmake\u201d is paired with a noun expressing the action\nof a verb, the resulting phrase is \u201capproximately equivalent in\nsense\u201d to that verb. 6 Oxford English Dictionary 66 (def. 59)\n(1933) (hereinafter OED); accord, Webster\u2019s New International\nDictionary 1485 (def. 43) (2d ed. 1934) (\u201cMakefollowed by\na noun with the indefinite article is often nearly equivalent to\nthe verb intransitive corresponding to that noun\u201d). For instance,\n\u201cto make a proclamation\u201d is the approximate equivalent of \u201cto\nproclaim,\u201d and \u201cto make a promise\u201d approximates \u201cto promise.\u201d See 6\nOED 66 (def. 59). The phrase at issue in Rule 10b\u20135, \u201c[t]o make any\n\u2026 statement,\u201d is thus the approximate equivalent of \u201cto state.\u201dFor purposes of Rule 10b\u20135, the\nmaker of a statement is the person or entity with ultimate\nauthority over the statement, including its content and whether and\nhow to communicate it. Without control, a person or entity can\nmerely suggest what to say, not \u201cmake\u201d a statement in its own\nright. One who prepares or publishes a statement on behalf of\nanother is not its maker. And in the ordinary case, attribution\nwithin a statement or implicit from surrounding circumstances is\nstrong evidence that a statement was made by\u2014and only by\u2014the party\nto whom it is attributed. This rule might best be exemplified by\nthe relationship between a speechwriter and a speaker. Even when a\nspeechwriter drafts a speech, the content is entirely within the\ncontrol of the person who delivers it. And it is the speaker who\ntakes credit\u2014or blame\u2014for what is ultimately said.This rule follows fromCentral Bank of\nDenver, N. A.v.First Interstate Bank of Denver, N.\nA.,511\nU. S. 164(1994), in which we held that Rule 10b\u20135\u2019s private\nright of action does not include suits against aiders and abettors.\nSeeid., at 180. Such suits\u2014against entities that\ncontribute \u201csubstantial assistance\u201d to the making of a statement\nbut do not actually make it\u2014may be brought by the SEC, see 15 U.\nS.\u00a0C.\u00a0A. \u00a778t(e), but not by private parties. A broader\nreading of \u201cmake,\u201d including persons or entities without ultimate\ncontrol over the content of a statement, would substantially\nundermineCentral Bank. If persons or entities without\ncontrol over the content of a statement could be considered primary\nviolators who \u201cmade\u201d the statement, then aiders and abettors would\nbe almost nonexistent.[Footnote\n6]This interpretation is further supported by\nour recent decision inStoneridge. There, investors sued\n\u201centities who, acting both as customers and suppliers, agreed to\narrangements that allowed the investors\u2019 company to mislead its\nauditor and issue a misleading financial statement.\u201d 552 U. S., at\n152\u2013153. We held that dismissal of the complaint was proper because\nthe public could not have relied on the entities\u2019 undisclosed\ndeceptive acts.Id., at 166\u2013167. Significantly, in\nreaching that conclusion we emphasized that \u201cnothing [the\ndefendants] did made it necessary or inevitable for [the company]\nto record the transactions as it did.\u201dId., at\n161.[Footnote 7] This emphasis\nsuggests the rule we adopt today: that the maker of a statement is\nthe entity with authority over the content of the statement and\nwhether and how to communicate it. Without such authority, it is\nnot \u201cnecessary or inevitable\u201d that any falsehood will be contained\nin the statement.Our holding also accords with the narrow scope\nthat we must give the implied private right of action.Id.,at 167. Although the existence of the private right\nis now settled, we will not expand liability beyond the person or\nentity that ultimately has authority over a false statement.2The Government contends that\n\u201cmake\u201d should be defined as \u201ccreate.\u201d Brief for United States asAmicus Curiae14\u201315 (citing Webster\u2019s New International\nDictionary 1485 (2d ed. 1958) (defining \u201cmake\u201d as \u201c[t]o cause to\nexist, appear, or occur\u201d)). This definition, although perhaps\nappropriate when \u201cmake\u201d is directed at an object unassociated with\na verb (e.g., \u201cto make a chair\u201d), fails to capture its\nmeaning when directed at an object expressing the action of a\nverb.Adopting the Government\u2019s\ndefinition of \u201cmake\u201d would also lead to results inconsistent with\nour precedent. The Government\u2019s definition would permit private\nplaintiffs to sue a person who \u201cprovides the false or misleading\ninformation that another person then puts into the statement.\u201d\nBrief for United States asAmicus Curiae13.[Footnote 8] But inStoneridge, we\nrejected a private Rule 10b\u20135 suit against companies involved in\ndeceptive transactions, even when information about those\ntransactions was later incorporated into false public statements.\n552 U. S., at 161. We see no reason to treat participating in the\ndrafting of a false statement differently from engaging in\ndeceptive transactions, when each is merely an undisclosed act\npreceding the decision of an independent entity to make a public\nstatement.For its part, First Derivative suggests that\nthe \u201cwell-recognized and uniquely close relationship between a\nmutual fund and its investment adviser\u201d should inform our decision.\nBrief for Respondent 21. It suggests that an investment adviser\nshould generally be understood to be the \u201cmaker\u201d of statements by\nits client mutual fund, like a playwright whose lines are delivered\nby an actor. We decline this invitation to disregard the corporate\nform. Although First Derivative and itsamicipersuasively\nargue that investment advisers exercise significant influence over\ntheir client funds, seeJonesv.Harris Associates\nL.\u00a0P., 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 1\u20132), it\nis undisputed that the corporate formalities were observed here.\nJCM and Janus Investment Fund remain legally separate entities, and\nJanus Investment Fund\u2019s board of trustees was more independent than\nthe statute requires. 15 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a780a\u201310.[Footnote 9] Any reapportionment of liability in\nthe securities industry in light of the close relationship between\ninvestment advisers and mutual funds is properly the responsibility\nof Congress and not the courts. Moreover, just as with the\nGovernment\u2019s theory, First Derivative\u2019s rule would create the broad\nliability that we rejected inStoneridge.Congress also has established liability in\n\u00a720(a) for \u201c[e]very person who, directly or indirectly, controls\nany person liable\u201d for violations of the securities laws. 15 U.\nS.\u00a0C.\u00a0A. \u00a778t(a). First Derivative\u2019s theory of liability\nbased on a relationship of influence resembles the liability\nimposed by Congress for control. To adopt First Derivative\u2019s theory\nwould read into Rule 10b\u20135 a theory of liability similar to\u2014but\nbroader in application than, seepost, at 9\u2014what Congress\nhas already created expressly elsewhere.[Footnote 10] We decline to do so.BUnder this rule, JCM did not\n\u201cmake\u201d any of the statements in the Janus Investment Fund\nprospectuses; Janus Investment Fund did. Only Janus Investment\nFund\u2014not JCM\u2014bears the statutory obligation to file the\nprospectuses with the SEC. 15 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a777e(b)(2), 80a\u20138(b),\n80a\u201329(a)\u2013(b); see also 17 CFR \u00a7230.497 (imposing requirements on\n\u201cinvestment companies\u201d). The SEC has recorded that Janus Investment\nFund filed the prospectuses. See JIF Group1 Standalone Prospectuses\n(Feb. 25, 2002), online at http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/\n277751\u00a0/\u00a0000027775102000049\u00a0/\u00a00000277751-02-000049.txt\n(as visited June 10, 2011, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case\nfile) (recording the \u201cFiler\u201d of the Janus Mercury Fund prospectus\nas \u201cJanus Investment Fund\u201d). There is no allegation that JCM in\nfact filed the prospectuses and falsely attributed them to Janus\nInvestment Fund. Nor did anything on the face of the prospectuses\nindicate that any statements therein came from JCM rather than\nJanus Investment Fund\u2014a legally independent entity with its own\nboard of trustees.[Footnote\n11]First Derivative suggests that\nboth JCM and Janus Investment Fund might have \u201cmade\u201d the misleading\nstatements within the meaning of Rule 10b\u20135 because JCM was\nsignificantly involved in preparing the prospectuses. But this\nassistance, subject to the ultimate control of Janus Investment\nFund, does not mean that JCM \u201cmade\u201d any statements in the\nprospectuses. Although JCM, like a speechwriter, may have assisted\nJanus Investment Fund with crafting what Janus Investment Fund said\nin the prospectuses, JCM itself did not \u201cmake\u201d those statements for\npurposes of Rule 10b\u20135.[Footnote\n12]*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*The statements in the Janus\nInvestment Fund prospectuses were made by Janus Investment Fund,\nnot by JCM. Accordingly, First Derivative has not stated a claim\nagainst JCM under Rule 10b\u20135. The judgment of the United States\nCourt of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit is reversed.It is so ordered.Footnote 1Market timing is a trading strategy that\nexploits time delay in mutual funds\u2019 daily valuation system. The\nprice for buying or selling shares of a mutual fund is ordinarily\ndetermined by the next net asset value (NAV) calculation after the\norder is placed. The NAV calculation usually happens once a day, at\nthe close of the major U. S. markets. Because of certain time\ndelays, however, the values used in these calculations do not\nalways accurately reflect the true value of the underlying assets.\nFor example, a fund may value its foreign securities based on the\nprice at the close of the foreign market, which may have occurred\nseveral hours before the calculation. But events might have taken\nplace after the close of the foreign market that could be expected\nto affect their price. If the event were expected to increase the\nprice of the foreign securities, a market-timing investor could buy\nshares of a mutual fund at the artificially low NAV and sell the\nnext day when the NAV corrects itself upward. See Disclosure\nRegarding Market Timing and Selective Disclosure of Portfolio\nHoldings, 68 Fed. Reg. 70402 (proposed Dec. 17, 2003).Footnote 2In 2004, JCG and JCM settled these\nallegations and agreed to reduce their fees by $125 million and pay\n$50 million in civil penalties and $50 million in disgorgement to\nthe mutual fund investors.Footnote 3The elements of a private action under Rule\n10b\u20135 are \u201c(1)\u00a0a material misrepresentation or omission by the\ndefendant; (2)\u00a0scienter; (3)\u00a0a connection between the\nmisrepresentation or omission and the purchase or sale of a\nsecurity; (4)\u00a0reliance upon the misrepresentation or omission;\n(5)\u00a0economic loss; and (6)\u00a0loss causation.\u201dStoneridge Investment Partners, LLCv.Scientific-Atlanta, Inc.,552 U. S. 148, 157 (2008).Footnote 4Rule 10b\u20135 makes it \u201cunlawful for any person,\ndirectly or indirectly, by the use of any means or instrumentality\nof interstate commerce, or of the mails or of any facility of any\nnational securities exchange, \u2026 [t]o make any untrue statement of a\nmaterial fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in\norder to make the statements made, in the light of the\ncircumstances under which they were made, not misleading \u2026\u00a0.\u201d\n17 CFR \u00a7240.10b\u20135(b).Footnote 5Although First Derivative argued below that\nJCG violated Rule 10b\u20135 by making the statements in the\nprospectuses, it now seeks to hold JCG liable solely as a control\nperson of JCM under \u00a720(a). The only question we must answer,\ntherefore, is whether JCM made the misstatements. Whether First\nDerivative has stated a claim against JCG as a control person\ndepends on whether it has stated a claim against JCM.Footnote 6The dissent correctly notes thatCentral\nBankinvolved secondary, not primary, liability.Post, at 4 (opinion of Breyer, J.). But forCentral\nBankto have any meaning, there must be some distinction\nbetween those who are primarily liable (and thus may be pursued in\nprivate suits) and those who are secondarily liable (and thus may\nnot be pursued in private suits).We draw a clean line between the two\u2014the maker\nis the person or entity with ultimate authority over a statement\nand others are not. In contrast, the dissent\u2019s only limit on\nprimary liability is not much of a limit at all. It would allow for\nprimary liability whenever \u201c[t]he specific relationships alleged \u2026\nwarrant [that] conclusion\u201d\u2014whatever that may mean.Post,\nat 11.Footnote 7We agree that \u201cno one inStoneridgecontended that the equipment suppliers were, in fact, themakersof the cable company\u2019s misstatements.\u201dPost, at 8. IfStoneridgehad addressed whether\nthe equipment suppliers were \u201cmakers,\u201d today\u2019s decision would be\nunnecessary. The point is thatStoneridge\u2019s analysis\nsuggests that they were not.Footnote 8Because we do not find the meaning of \u201cmake\u201d\nin Rule 10b\u20135 to be ambiguous, we need not consider the\nGovernment\u2019s assertion that we should defer to the SEC\u2019s\ninterpretation of the word elsewhere. Brief for United States asAmicus Curiae13 (citing Brief for SEC asAmicus\nCuriaeinPacific Inv. Mgmt. Co. LLCv.Mayer\nBrown LLP, No. 09\u20131619 (CA2), p. 7); seeChristensenv.Harris County,529 U. S. 576, 588\n(2000). We note, however, that we have previously expressed\nskepticism over the degree to which the SEC should receive\ndeference regarding the private right of action. SeePiperv.Chris-Craft Industries, Inc.,430 U. S. 1, 41, n. 27\n(1977) (noting that the SEC\u2019s presumed expertise \u201cis of limited\nvalue\u201d when analyzing \u201cwhether a cause of action should be implied\nby judicial interpretation in favor of a particular class of\nlitigants\u201d). This also is not the first time this Court has\ndisagreed with the SEC\u2019s broad view of \u00a710(b) or Rule 10b\u20135. See,e.g.,Central Bank of Denver, N. A.v.First\nInterstate Bank of Denver, N. A.,511 U. S. 164, 188\u2013191 (1994);Dirksv.SEC,463 U. S. 646, 666, n.\n27 (1983);Ernst & Ernstv.Hochfelder,425 U. S. 185,\n207 (1976);Blue Chip Stampsv.Manor Drug\nStores,421 U.\nS. 723, 746, n. 10 (1975).Footnote 9Nor does First Derivative contend that any\nstatements made by JCM to Janus Investment Fund were \u201cpublic\nstatements\u201d for the purposes ofBasic Inc.v.Levinson,485 U. S. 224, 227\u2013228\n(1988). We do not address whether and in what circumstances\nstatements would qualify as \u201cpublic.\u201d Cf.post, at 12\u201313\n(citing cases involving liability for statements made to analysts);In\u00a0re Aetna, Inc.

S.\u00a0C. A. \u00a778t(b). See Tr. of Oral Arg. 6, 61.Footnote 11First Derivative suggests that \u201cindirectly\u201d\nin Rule 10b\u20135 may broaden the meaning of \u201cmake.\u201d We disagree. The\nphrase \u201cdirectly or indirectly\u201d is set off by itself in Rule 10b\u20135\nand modifies not just \u201cto make,\u201d but also \u201cto employ\u201d and \u201cto\nengage.\u201d We think the phrase merely clarifies that as long as a\nstatement is made, it does not matter whether the statement was\ncommunicated directly or indirectly to the recipient. A different\nunderstanding of \u201cindirectly\u201d would, like a broad definition of\n\u201cmake,\u201d threaten to erase the line between primary violators and\naiders and abettors established byCentral Bank.In this case, we need not define precisely\nwhat it means to communicate a \u201cmade\u201d statement indirectly because\nnone of the statements in the prospectuses were attributed,\nexplicitly or implicitly, to JCM. Without attribution, there is no\nindication that Janus Investment Fund was quoting or otherwise\nrepeating a statement originally \u201cmade\u201d by JCM. Cf.Anixterv.Home-Stake Production Co., 77\nF.\u00a03d 1215, 1220, and n. 4 (CA10 1996) (quoting a signed\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018Auditor\u2019s Report\u2019\u00a0\u201d included in a pro-spectus);Basic,supra, at 227, n. 4 (quoting a news item\nreporting a state-ment by Basic\u2019s president). More may be required\nto find that a person or entity made a statement indirectly, but\nattribution is necessary.Footnote 12That JCM provided access to Janus Investment\nFund\u2019s prospectuses on its Web site is also not a basis for\nliability. Merely hosting a document on a Web site does not\nindicate that the hosting entity adopts the document as its own\nstatement or exercises control over its content. Cf.United\nStatesv.Ware, 577 F.\u00a03d 442, 448 (CA2 2009)\n(involving the issuance of false press releases through innocent\ncompanies). In doing so, we do not think JCM made any of the\nstatements in Janus Investment Fund\u2019s prospectuses for purposes of\nRule 10b\u20135 liability, just as we do not think that the SEC \u201cmakes\u201d\nthe statements in the many prospectuses available on its Web\nsite.",
