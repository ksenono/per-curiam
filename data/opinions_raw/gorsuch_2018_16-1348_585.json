To address the problem, he agreed to sever the charges\nand hold two trials instead of one. But after the first trial\nfinished, Mr. Currier turned around and argued that proceeding with\nthe second would violate his right against double jeopardy. All of\nwhich raises the question: can a defendant who agrees to have the\ncharges against him considered in two trials later successfully\nargue that the second trial offends the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Double\nJeopardy Clause?IThis case began when police dredged up a safe\nfull of guns from a Virginia river. Paul Garrison, the safe\u2019s\nowner, had reported it stolen from his home. Before the theft, Mr.\nGarrison said, it contained not just the guns but also $71,000 in\ncash. Now, most of the money was missing. As the investigation\nunfolded, the police eventually found their way to Mr. Garrison\u2019s\nnephew. Once confronted, the nephew quickly confessed. Along the\nway, he pointed to Michael Currier as his accomplice. A neighbor\nalso reported that she saw Mr. Currier leave the Garrison home\naround the time of the crime. On the strength of this evidence, a\ngrand jury indicted Mr. Currier for burglary, grand larceny, and\nunlawful possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. The last\ncharge followed in light of Mr. Currier\u2019s previous convictions for\n(as it happens) burglary and larceny.Because the prosecution could introduce evidence\nof his prior convictions to prove the felon-in-possession charge,\nand worried that the evidence might prejudice the jury\u2019s\nconsideration of the other charges, Mr. Currier and the government\nagreed to a severance. They asked the court to try the burglary and\nlarceny charges first. Then, they said, the felon-in-possession\ncharge could follow in a second trial. Some jurisdictions routinely\nrefuse requests like this. Instead, they seek to address the risk\nof prejudice with an instruction directing the jury to consider the\ndefendant\u2019s prior convictions only when assessing the\nfelon-in-possession charge. See Brief for Indiana et\u00a0al. asAmici Curiae10. Other jurisdictions allow parties to\nstipulate to the defendant\u2019s past convictions so the particulars of\nthose crimes don\u2019t reach the jury\u2019s ears.Ibid. Others take\na more protective approach yet and view severance requests with\nfavor.Id.,at 11\u201312; see,e.g.,Hackneyv.Commonwealth,28 Va. App. 288, 294\u2013296, 504 S.E.2d 385, 389\n(1998) (en banc). Because Virginia falls into this last group, the\ntrial court granted the parties\u2019 joint request in this case.The promised two trials followed. At the first,\nthe prosecution produced the nephew and the neighbor who testified\nto Mr. Currier\u2019s involvement in the burglary and larceny. But Mr.\nCurrier argued that the nephew lied and the neighbor was unreliable\nand, in the end, the jury acquitted. Then, before the second trial\non the firearm charge could follow, Mr. Currier sought to stop it.\nNow, he argued, holding a second trial would amount to double\njeopardy. Alternatively and at the least, he asked the court to\nforbid the government from relitigating in the second trial any\nissue resolved in his favor at the first. So, for example, he said\nthe court should exclude from the new proceeding any evidence about\nthe burglary and larceny. The court replied that it could find\nnothing in the Double Jeopardy Clause requiring either result so it\nallowed the second trial to proceed unfettered. In the end, the\njury convicted Mr. Currier on the felon-in-possession charge.Before the Virginia Court of Appeals, Mr.\nCurrier repeated his double jeopardy arguments without success. The\ncourt held that the \u201cconcern that lies at the core\u201d of the Double\nJeopardy Clause\u2014namely, \u201cthe avoidance of prosecutorial oppression\nand overreaching through successive trials\u201d\u2014had no application here\nbecause the charges were severed for Mr. Currier\u2019s benefit and at\nhis behest.Currierv.Commonwealth, 65 Va. App. 605,\n609\u2013613, 779 S.E.2d 834, 836\u2013837 (2015). The Virginia Supreme Court\nsummarily affirmed. Because courts have reached conflicting results\non the double jeopardy arguments Mr. Currier pressed in this case,\nwe granted certiorari to resolve them. 583 U.\u00a0S. ___\n(2017).IIThe Double Jeopardy Clause, applied to the\nStates through the Fourteenth Amendment, provides that no person\nmay be tried more than once \u201cfor the same offence.\u201d This guarantee\nrecognizes the vast power of the sovereign, the ordeal of a\ncriminal trial, and the injustice our criminal justice system would\ninvite if prosecutors could treat trials as dress rehearsals until\nthey secure the convictions they seek. SeeGreenv.United States, 355 U.\u00a0S. 187, 188 (1957). At the same\ntime, this Court has said, the Clause was not written or originally\nunderstood to pose \u201can insuperable obstacle to the administration\nof justice\u201d in cases where \u201cthere is no semblance of [these]\ntype[s] of oppressive practices.\u201dWadev.Hunter, 336\nU.\u00a0S. 684, 688\u2013689 (1949).On which side of the line does our case fall?\nMr. Currier suggests this Court\u2019s decision inAshev.Swenson, 397 U.\u00a0S. 436 (1970), requires a ruling for\nhim. There, the government accused a defendant of robbing six poker\nplayers in a game at a private home. At the first trial, the jury\nacquitted the defendant of robbing one victim. Then the State\nsought to try the defendant for robbing a second victim. This Court\nheld the second prosecution violated the Double Jeopardy Clause.Id.,at 446. To be sure, the Clause speaks of barring\nsuccessive trials for the same offense. And, to be sure, the State\nsought to try the defendant for adifferentrobbery. But,\nthe Court reasoned, because the first jury necessarily found that\nthe defendant \u201cwas not one of the robbers,\u201d a second jury could not\n\u201crationally\u201d convict the defendant of robbing the second victim\nwithout calling into question the earlier acquittal.Id., at\n445\u2013446. In these circumstances, the Court indicated, any\nrelitigation of the issue whether the defendant parti- cipated as\n\u201cone of the robbers\u201d would be tantamount to the forbidden\nrelitigation of the same offense resolved at the first trial.Id.,at 445; seeYeagerv.United States, 557\nU.\u00a0S. 110,119\u2013120 (2009).Ashe\u2019s suggestion that the relitigation\nof an issue can sometimes amount to the impermissible relitigation\nof an offense represented a significant innovation in our\njurisprudence. Some have argued that it sits uneasily with this\nCourt\u2019s double jeopardy precedent and the Constitution\u2019s original\nmeaning. See,e.g., Ashe,supra, at 460\u2013461 (Burger,\nC.\u00a0J., dissenting);Yeager,supra, at 127\u2013128\n(Scalia, J., dissenting). But whatever else may be said aboutAshe, we have emphasized that its test is a demanding one.Asheforbids a second trial only if to secure a conviction\nthe prosecution must prevail on an issue the jury necessarily\nresolved in the defendant\u2019s favor in the first trial. SeeYeager,supra,at 119\u2013120;id.,at 127\n(Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment);id.,at 133\u2013134 (Alito, J., dissenting). A second trial \u201cis\nnot precluded simply because it is unlikely\u2014or even very\nunlikely\u2014that the original jury acquitted without finding the fact\nin question.\u201dIbid. To say that the second trial is\ntantamount to a trial of the same offense as the first and thus\nforbidden by the Double Jeopardy Clause, we must be able to say\nthat \u201cit would have beenirrationalfor the jury\u201d in the\nfirst trial to acquit without finding in the defendant\u2019s favor on a\nfact essential to a conviction in the second.Id.,at 127\n(opinion of Kennedy, J.) (internal quotation marks omitted).Bearing all that in mind, a critical difference\nimmediately emerges between our case andAshe. Even assuming\nwithout deciding that Mr. Currier\u2019s second trial qualified as the\nretrial of the same offense underAshe, he consented to it.\nNor does anyone doubt that trying all three charges in one trial\nwould have prevented any possibleAshecomplaint Mr. Currier\nmight have had.How do these features affect the double jeopardy\ncalculus? A precedent points the way. InJeffersv.United States, 432 U.\u00a0S. 137 (1977), the defendant\nsought separate trials on each of the counts against him to reduce\nthe possibility of prejudice. The court granted his request. After\nthe jury convicted the defendant in the first trial of a\nlesser-included offense, he argued that the prosecution could not\nlater try him for a greater offense. In any other circumstance the\ndefendant likely would have had a good argument. Historically,\ncourts have treated greater and lesser-included offenses as the\nsame offense for double jeopardy purposes, so a conviction on one\nnormally precludes a later trial on the other.Id.,at\n150\u2013151 (plurality opinion);Brownv.Ohio, 432\nU.\u00a0S. 161, 168\u2013169 (1977) (collecting authorities). But,Jeffersconcluded, it\u2019s different when the defendant\nconsents to two trials where one could have done. If a single trial\non multiple charges would suffice to avoid a double jeopardy\ncomplaint, \u201cthere is no violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause\nwhen [the defendant] elects to have the .\u00a0.\u00a0. offenses\ntried separately and persuades the trial court to honor his\nelection.\u201d 432 U.\u00a0S., at 152.What was true inJeffers, we hold, can be\nno less true here. If a defendant\u2019s consent to two trials can\novercome concerns lying at the historic core of the Double Jeopardy\nClause, so too we think it must overcome a double jeopardy\ncomplaint underAshe. Nor does anything inJefferssuggest that the outcome should be different if the first trial\nyielded an acquittal rather than a conviction when a defendant\nconsents to severance. While we acknowledge thatAshe\u2019s\nprotections apply only to trials following acquittals, as a general\nrule, the Double Jeopardy Clause \u201c\u00a0\u2018protects against a second\nprosecution for the same offense after conviction\u2019\u00a0\u201d as well\nas \u201c\u00a0\u2018against a second prosecution for the same offense after\nacquittal.\u2019\u00a0\u201dBrown, supra,at 165. Because the Clause\napplies equally in both situations, consent to a second trial\nshould in general have equal effect in both situations.Holding otherwise would introduce an unwarranted\ninconsistency not just withJeffersbut with other\nprecedents too. InUnited Statesv.Dinitz, 424\nU.\u00a0S. 600 (1976), for example, this Court held that a\ndefendant\u2019s mistrial motion implicitly invited a second trial and\nwas enough to foreclose any double jeopardy complaint about it. In\nreaching this holding, the Court expressly rejected \u201cthe contention\nthat the permissibility of a retrial depends on a knowing,\nvoluntary, and intelligent waiver\u201d from the defendant.Id.,at 609 n.\u00a011. Instead, it explained, none of the\n\u201cprosecutorial or judicial overreaching\u201d forbidden by the\nConstitution can be found when a second trial follows thanks to the\ndefendant\u2019s motion.Id.at 607. InUnited Statesv.Scott, 437 U.\u00a0S. 82 (1978), this Court likewise held\nthat a defendant\u2019s motion effectively invited a retrial of the same\noffense, and \u201cthe Double Jeopardy Clause, which guards against\nGovernment oppression, does not relieve a defendant from the\nconsequences of [a] voluntary choice\u201d like that.Id.,at 96,\n99; see alsoEvansv.Michigan, 568 U.\u00a0S. 313,\n326 (2013) (\u201c[R]etrial is generally allowed [when] the defendant\nconsents to a disposition that contemplates reprosecution\u201d). While\nrelinquishing objections sometimes turns on state or federal\nprocedural rules, these precedents teach that consenting to two\ntrials when one would have avoided a double jeopardy problem\nprecludes any constitutional violation associated with holding a\nsecond trial. In these circumstances, our cases hold, the defendant\nwins a potential benefit and experiences none of the prosecutorial\n\u201coppression\u201d the Double Jeopardy Clause exists to prevent. Nor,\nagain, can we discern a good reason to treatAshedouble\njeopardy complaints more favorably than traditional ones when a\ndefendant consents to severance.Against these precedents, Mr. Currier asks us to\nconsider others, especiallyHarrisv.Washington, 404\nU.\u00a0S. 55 (1971) (per curiam) andTurnerv.Arkansas, 407 U.\u00a0S. 366 (1972) (per curiam). But\nthese cases merely appliedAshe\u2019s test and concluded that a\nsecond trial was impermissible. They did not address the question\nwhether double jeopardy protections apply if the defendantconsentsto a second trial. Meanwhile, as we\u2019ve seen,Jeffers,Dinitz, andScottfocus on that\nquestion directly and make clear that a defendant\u2019s consent dispels\nany specter of double jeopardy abuse that holding two trials might\notherwise present. This Court\u2019s teachings are consistent and plain:\nthe \u201cClause, which guards against Government oppression, does not\nrelieve a defendant from the consequences of his voluntary choice.\u201dScott,supra, at 99.Mr. Currier replies that he had no real choice\nbut to seek two trials. Without a second trial, he says, evidence\nof his prior convictions would have tainted the jury\u2019s\nconsideration of the burglary and larceny charges. And, he notes,\nVirginia law guarantees a severance in cases like his unless the\ndefendant and prosecution agree to a single trial. But no one\ndisputes that the Constitution permitted Virginia to try all three\ncharges at once with appropriate cautionary instructions. So this\nsimply isn\u2019t a case where the defendant had to give up one\nconstitutional right to secure another. Instead, Mr. Currier faced\na lawful choice between two courses of action that each bore\npotential costs and rationally attractive benefits. It might have\nbeen a hard choice. But litigants every day face difficult\ndecisions. Whether it\u2019s the defendant who finds himself in the\nshoes of Jeffers, Dinitz, and Scott and forced to choose between\nallowing an imperfect trial to proceed or seeking a second that\npromises its own risks. Or whether it\u2019s the defendant who must\ndecide between exercising his right to testify in his own defense\nor keeping impeachment evidence of past bad acts from the jury.\nSee,e.g., Brownv.United States, 356 U.\u00a0S.\n148, 154\u2013157 (1958). This Court has held repeatedly that difficult\nstrategic choices like these are \u201cnot the same as no choice,\u201dUnited Statesv.Martinez-Salazar, 528 U.\u00a0S.\n304, 315 (2000), and the Constitution \u201cdoes not .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nforbid requiring\u201d a litigant to make them,McGauthav.California, 402 U.\u00a0S. 183, 213 (1971).IIIEven if he voluntarily consented to holding\nthe second trial, Mr. Currier argues, that consent did not extend\nto the relitigation of any issues the first jury resolved in his\nfavor. So, Mr. Currier says, the court should have excluded\nevidence suggesting he possessed the guns in Mr. Gar- rison\u2019s home,\nleaving the prosecution to prove that he possessed them only later,\nmaybe down by the river. To support this argument, Mr. Currier\npoints to issue preclusion principles in civil cases and invites us\nto import them for the first time into the criminal law through the\nDouble Jeopardy Clause. In his view, the Clause should do much more\nthan bar the retrial of the same offense (or crimes tantamount to\nthe same offense underAshe); it should be read now to\nprevent the parties from retrying any issue or introducing any\nevidence about a previously tried issue. While the dissent today\nagrees with us that the trial court committed no double jeopardy\nviolation in holding the second trial, on this alternative argument\nit sides with Mr. Currier. Seepost,at 11, 12, 14\u201315.We cannot. Even assuming for argument\u2019s sake\nthat Mr. Currier\u2019s consent toholdinga second trial didn\u2019t\nmore broadly imply consent to themannerit was conducted,\nwe must reject his argument on a narrower ground. Just last Term\nthis Court warned that issue preclusion principles should have only\n\u201cguarded application .\u00a0.\u00a0. in criminal cases.\u201dBravo-Fernandezv.United States, 580 U.\u00a0S. ___,\n___ (2016) (slip op. at 4). We think that caution remains\nsound.Mr. Currier\u2019s problems begin with the text of\nthe Double Jeopardy Clause. As we\u2019ve seen, the Clause speaks not\nabout prohibiting the relitigation of issues or evidence but\noffenses. Contrast this with the language of the Reexamination\nClause. There, the Seventh Amendment says that \u201c[i]n Suits at\ncommon law .\u00a0.\u00a0.no facttried by a jury,shall\nbe otherwise re-examinedin any Court of the United States,\nthan according to the rules of the common law.\u201d (Emphasis added.)\nWords in one provision are, of course, often understood \u201cby\ncomparing them with other words and sentences in the same\ninstrument.\u201d 1 J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the\nUnited States \u00a7400, p. 384 (1833). So it\u2019s difficult to ignore that\nonly in the Seventh Amendment\u2014and only for civil suits\u2014can we find\nanything resembling contemporary issue preclusion doctrine.What problems the text suggests, the original\npublic understanding of the Fifth Amendment confirms. The Double\nJeopardy Clause took its cue from English common law pleas that\nprevented courts from retrying a criminal defendant previously\nacquitted or convicted of the crime in question. SeeScott,\n437 U.\u00a0S., at 87; 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of\nEngland 329\u2013330 (1769). But those pleas barred only repeated\n\u201cprosecution for the same identical actandcrime,\u201d not the\nretrial of particular issues or evidence.Id.,at 330\n(emphasis added). As Sir Matthew Hale explained:\u201cIfA.commit a burglary\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. and likewise at the same time steal goods out of\nthe house, if he be indicted of larciny for the goods and\nacquitted, yet he may be indicted for the burglary notwithstanding\nthe acquittal. And\u00e8 converso, if indicted for the burglary\nand acquitted, yet he may be indicted of the larciny, for they are\nseveral offenses, tho committed at the same time.\u201d 2 M. Hale, The\nHistory of the Pleas of the Crown, ch. 31, pp.\u00a0245\u2013246 (1736\ned.).Both English and early American cases illustrate\nthe point. InTurner\u2019s Case, 30 Kel. J. 30, 84 Eng. Rep.\n1068 (K. B. 1663), for example, a jury acquitted the defendant of\nbreaking into a home and stealing money from the owner. Even so,\nthe court held that the defendant could be tried later for the\ntheft of money \u201cstolen at the same time\u201d from the owner\u2019s servant.Ibid. InCommonwealthv.Roby, 12 Pickering\n496 (Mass. 1832), the court, invoking Blackstone, held that \u201c[i]n\nconsidering the identity of the of- fence, it must appear by the\nplea, that the offence charged in both cases was the samein\nlawandin fact.\u201dId.,at 509. The court\nexplained that a second prosecution isn\u2019t precluded \u201cif the\noffences charged in the two indictments be perfectly distinct in\npoint of law,however nearly they may be connected in fact.\u201dIbid.(emphasis added). Another court even ruled \u201cthat a man\nacquitted for stealing the horse hath yet been arraigned and\nconvict for stealing the saddle, tho both were done at the same\ntime.\u201d 2 Hale,supra,at 246. These authorities and many\nmore like them demonstrate that early courts regularly confronted\ncases just like ours and expressly rejected the notion that the\nDouble Jeopardy Clause barred the relitigation of issues or facts.\nSee alsoGradyv.Corbin, 495 U.\u00a0S. 508, 533\u2013535\n(1990) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (collecting authorities); 2 W.\nHawkins, Pleas of the Crown, ch. 35, p. 371 (1726 ed.); 1 J.\nChitty, Criminal Law 452\u2013457 (1816); M. Friedland, Double Jeopardy\n179, and n.\u00a02 (1969). Any suggestion that our case presents a\nnew phenomenon, then, risks overlooking this long history. Seepost,at 4\u20135 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting).This Court\u2019s contemporary double jeopardy cases\nconfirm what the text and history suggest. UnderBlockburgerv.United States, 284 U.\u00a0S. 299 (1932), the courts\napply today much the same double jeopardy test they did at the\nfounding.Id.,at 304. To prevent a second trial on a new\ncharge, the defendant must show an identity ofstatutory\nelementsbetween the two charges against him; it\u2019s not enough\nthat \u201ca substantial overlap [exists] in theproofoffered to\nestablish the crimes.\u201dIannelliv.United States, 420\nU.\u00a0S. 770, 785, n.\u00a017 (1975) (emphasis added). Of course,Ashelater pressedBlockburger\u2019s boundaries by\nsuggesting that, in narrow circumstances, the retrial of an issue\ncan be considered tantamount to the retrial of an offense. SeeYeager,557 U.\u00a0S., at 119. But, as we\u2019ve seen, even\nthere a court\u2019s ultimate focus remains on the practi- cal identity\nof offenses, and the only available remedy is the traditional\ndouble jeopardy bar against the retrial of the same offense\u2014not a\nbar against the relitigation of issues or evidence. Seeid.,at 119\u2013120. Even at the outer reaches of our double jeopardy\njurisprudence, then, this Court has never sought to regulate the\nretrial of issues or evidence in the name of the Double Jeopardy\nClause.Nor in acknowledging this do we plow any new\nground. InDowlingv.United States, 493 U.\u00a0S.\n342 (1990), the defendant faced charges of bank robbery. At trial,\nthe prosecution introduced evidence of the defendant\u2019s involvement\nin an earlier crime, even though the jury in that case had\nacquitted. Like Mr. Currier, the defendant inDowlingargued\nthat the trial court should have barred relitigation of an issue\nresolved in his favor in an earlier case and therefore excluded\nevidence of the acquitted offense. But the Court refused the\nrequest and in doing so expressly \u201cdecline[d] to extendAshe.\u00a0.\u00a0. to exclude in all circumstances, as [the defendant]\nwould have it, relevant and probative evidence that is otherwise\nadmissible under the Rules of Evidence simply because it relates to\nalleged criminal conduct for which a defendant has been acquitted.\u201dId., at 348. If a second trial is permissible, the admission\nof evidence at that trial is governed by normal evidentiary\nrules\u2014not by the terms of the Double Jeopardy Clause. \u201cSo far as\nmerely evidentiary .\u00a0.\u00a0. facts are concerned,\u201d the Double\nJeopardy Clause \u201cis inoperative.\u201dYatesv.United\nStates, 354 U.\u00a0S. 298, 338 (1957).On its own terms, too, any effort to transplant\ncivil preclusion principles into the Double Jeopardy Clause would\nquickly meet trouble. While the Clause embodies a kind of \u201cclaim\npreclusion\u201d rule, even this rule bears little in common with its\ncivil counterpart. In civil cases, a claim generally may not be\ntried if it arises out of the same transaction or common nucleus of\noperative facts as another already tried. Restatement (Second) of\nJudg- ments \u00a719 (1982); Moschzisker, Res Judicata, 38 Yale L. J.\n299, 325 (1929). But in a criminal case,Blockburgerprecludes a trial on an offense only if a court has previously\nheard the same offense as measured by its statutory elements. 284\nU.\u00a0S., at 304. And this Court has emphatic- ally refused to\nimport into criminal double jeopardy law the civil law\u2019s more\ngenerous \u201csame transaction\u201d or same criminal \u201cepisode\u201d test. SeeGarrettv.United States,471\nU.S. 773, 790 (1985); see alsoAshe,397 U.\u00a0S., at\n448 (Harlan, J., concurring).It isn\u2019t even clear that civil preclusion\nprinciples would help defendants like Mr. Currier. Issue preclusion\naddresses the effect in a current case of a prior adjudication inanother case. So it doesn\u2019t often have much to say about the\npreclusive effects of rulings \u201cwithin the framework of a continuing\naction.\u201d 18A C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice and\nProcedure \u00a74434 (2d ed. 2002); see alsoid., \u00a74478. Usually,\nonly the more flexible law of the case doctrine governs the\npreclusive effect of an earlier decision \u201cwithin a single action.\u201dIbid.And that doctrine might counsel against affording\nconclusive effect to a prior jury verdict on a particular issue\nwhen the partiesagreedto hold a second trial covering much\nthe same terrain at a later stage of the proceedings. Besides, even\nif issue preclusion is the right doctrine for cases like ours, its\napplication usually depends \u201con \u2018an underlying confidence that the\nresult achieved in the initial litigation was substantially\ncorrect.\u2019\u00a0\u201dBravo-Fernandez, 580 U.\u00a0S., at ___\n(slip op., at 4) (quotingStandeferv.United States,\n447 U.\u00a0S. 10, 23, n.\u00a018 (1980)). As a result, the\ndoctrine does not often bar the relitigation of issues when \u201c[t]he\nparty against whom preclusion is sought could not, as a matter of\nlaw, have obtained review of the judgment in the initial action.\u201d\nRestatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a728. In criminal cases, of\ncourse, the government cannot obtain appellate review of\nacquittals. So a faithful application of civil preclusion\nprinciples in our case and others like it might actually militateagainstfinding preclusion. SeeBravo-Fernandez,supra,at ___ (slip op., at 4);Standefer,supra, at 22\u201323, and n. 18.Neither Mr. Currier nor the dissent offers a\npersuasive reply to these points. They cannot dispute that the text\nof the Double Jeopardy Clause, which bars a prosecution for the\nsame offense, is inconsistent with an issue preclusion rule that\npurports to bar a \u201csecond prosecution involv[ing] . . . a different\n\u2018offense.\u2019\u00a0\u201dPost,at 4. They decline to \u201cengage\u201d with\nthe Clause\u2019s history, though the dissent appears to agree that the\nClause was not originally understood to include an issue preclusion\nrule. Seepost,at 3\u20134, 13. Neither Mr. Currier nor the\ndissent seeks to show that, even taken on their own terms, civil\nissue preclusion principles would apply to cases like this one.\nWithout text, history, or logic to stand on, the dissent leans\nheavily on a comparison toDowling. InDowling, the\ndissent emphasizes, the two trials involved different criminal\nepisodes while the two trials here addressed the same set of facts.\nButDowlingdid not rest its holding on this feature and the\ndissent does not explain its relevance. If issue preclusion really\ndid exist in criminal law, why wouldn\u2019t it preclude the retrial ofanypreviously tried issue, regardless whether that issue\nstems from the same or a different \u201ccriminal episode\u201d?In the end, Mr. Currier and the dissent must\nemphasize various policy reasons for adopting a new rule of issue\npreclusion into the criminal law. Seepost,at 4\u20135, 8\u20139.\nThey contend that issue preclusion is \u201cneeded\u201d to combat the\n\u201cprosecutorial excesses\u201d that could result from the proliferation\nof criminal offenses,post,at 4\u20135, though we aren\u2019t sure\nwhat to make of this given the dissent\u2019s later claim that \u201cissue\npreclusion requires no showing of prosecutorial overreaching,\u201dpost,at 8. In any event, there are risks with the approach\nMr. Currier and the dissent pro- pose. Consider, for example, the\nironies that grafting civil preclusion principles onto the criminal\nlaw could invite. Issue preclusion is sometimes applied offensively\nagainst civil defendants who lost on an issue in an earlier case.Parklane Hosiery Co.v.Shore, 439 U.\u00a0S. 322,\n331\u2013332 (1979). By parallel logic, could we expect the government\nto invoke the doctrine to bar criminal defendants from relitigating\nissues decided against them in a prior trial? It\u2019s an outcome few\ndefendants would welcome but one some have already promoted. See,e.g.,Kennelly, Precluding the Accused: Offensive Collateral\nEstoppel in Criminal Cases, 80 Va. L.\u00a0Rev. 1379, 1380\u20131381,\n1416, 1426\u20131427 (1994); Vestal, Issue Preclusion and Criminal\nProsecutions, 65 Iowa L.\u00a0Rev. 281, 297, 320\u2013321 (1980).Maybe worse yet, consider the possible effect on\nseverances. Today, some state courts grant severance motions\nliberally to benefit defendants. But what would happen if this\nCourt unilaterally increased the costs associated with severance in\nthe form of allowing issue preclusion for defendants only? Granting\na severance is no small thing. It means a court must expend\nresources for two trials where the Constitution would have\npermitted one. Witnesses and victims must endure a more protracted\nordeal. States sometimes accept these costs to protect a defendant\nfrom potential prejudice. But 20 States appearing before us have\nwarned that some jurisdictions might respond to any decision\nincreasing the costs of severed trials by making them less freely\navailable. See Brief for Indiana et\u00a0al. asAmici Curiae4, 16\u201320. Of course, that\u2019s only a prediction. But it\u2019s a hard if\nunwanted fact that \u201c[t]oday\u2019s elaborate body of procedural rules\u201d\ncan contribute to making \u201ctrials expensive [and] rare.\u201d W. Stuntz,\nThe Collapse of American Criminal Justice 39 (2011). And it would\nbe a mistake to ignore the possibility that by making severances\nmore costly we might wind up making them rarer too.The fact is, civil preclusion principles and\ndouble jeop- ardy are different doctrines, with different\nhistories, serving different purposes. Historically, both claim and\nissue preclusion have sought to \u201cpromot[e] judicial economy by\npreventing needless litigation.\u201dParklane Hosiery,supra,at 326. That interest may make special sense in civil\ncases where often only money is at stake. But the Double Jeopardy\nClause and the common law principles it built upon governcriminalcases and concern more than efficiency. They aim\ninstead, as we\u2019ve seen, to balance vital interests against abusive\nprosecutorial practices with consideration to the public\u2019s safety.\nThe Clause\u2019s terms and history simply do not contain the rights Mr.\nCurrier seeks.Nor are we at liberty to rewrite those terms or\nthat history. While the growing number of criminal offenses in our\nstatute books may be cause for concern, seepost,at 4\u20135\n(Ginsburg, J., dissenting), no one should expect (or want) judges\nto revise the Constitution to address every social problem they\nhappen to perceive. The proper authorities, the States and\nCongress, are empowered to adopt new laws or rules experimenting\nwith issue or claim preclusion in criminal cases if they wish. In\nfact, some States have already done so. On these matters, the\nConstitution dictates no answers but entrusts them to a\nself-governing people to resolve.*The judgment of the Virginia Supreme Court\nisAffirmed.",
