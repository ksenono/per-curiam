SKINNER, PETITIONERv.LYNN\nSWITZER, DISTRICT ATTORNEY FOR THE 31st JUDICIAL DISTRICT OF\nTEXASon writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the fifth circuit[March 7, 2011]Justice Thomas, with whom Justice\nKennedy and Justice Alito join, dissenting.The Court holds that Skinner may\nbring under 42 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71983 his \u201cprocedural due process\u201d\nclaim challenging \u201cTexas\u2019 postconviction DNA statute.\u201dAnte, at 8. I disagree.[Footnote 1] I accept the majority\u2019s characterization of\nthe issue here as the question left open inDistrict Attorney\u2019s\nOffice for Third Judicial Dist.v.Osborne,557 U. S.\n___ (2009),ante, at 1, where a prisoner challenged the\nconstitutional adequacy of the access to DNA evidence provided by\nAlaska\u2019s \u201cgeneral postconviction relief statute,\u201d 557 U. S., at ___\n(slip op., at 10). Like Osborne, Skinner seeks to challenge state\ncollateral review procedures.[Footnote 2] I would now hold that these claims are not\ncognizable under \u00a71983.IThe Court has recognized that\n\u00a71983 does not reach to the full extent of its \u201cbroad language.\u201dPreiserv.Rodriguez,411 U. S. 475, 489\n(1973); see,e.g.,Heckv.Humphrey,512 U. S. 477, 485 (1994) (\u00a71983\nshould not \u201cexpand opportunities for collateral attack\u201d). But this\nCourt has never purported to fully circumscribe the boundaries of\n\u00a71983. Cf.id., at 482. Rather, we have evaluated each\nclaim as it has come before us, reasoning from first principles and\nour prior decisions.InPreiserv.Rodriguez, the Court began with the undisputed proposition\nthat a state prisoner may not use \u00a71983 to \u201cchalleng[e] his\nunderlying conviction and sentence on federal constitutional\ngrounds.\u201d 411 U. S., at 489. This included attacks on the trial\nprocedures. Seeid., at 486 (\u201cden[ial] [of] constitutional\nrights at trial\u201d). From there, the Court reasoned that \u201cimmediate\nrelease from [physical] confinement or the shortening of its\nduration\u201d also cannot be sought under \u00a71983.Id., at 489;\nsee alsoWolffv.McDonnell,418 U. S. 539(1974)\n(refusing to allow a \u00a71983 suit for restoration of good-time\ncredits);Edwardsv.Balisok,520 U. S. 641(1997)\n(refusing to allow a \u00a71983 procedural challenge to the process used\nto revoke good-time credits). Then, inHeckv.Humphrey, we addressed \u00a71983 actions seeking damages. 512\nU. S., at 483. Determining that such actions were not covered byPreiser, we returned to \u201cthe hoary principle that civil\ntort actions are not appropriate vehicles for challenging the\nvalidity of outstanding criminal judgments,\u201d 512 U. S., at 486, and\nconcluded that a complaint must be dismissed where \u201ca judgment in\nfavor of the plaintiff would necessarily imply the invalidity of\nhis conviction or sentence,\u201did., at 487. Most recently,\ninWilkinsonv.Dotson,544 U. S. 74, 82 (2005), we applied the\nprinciples from these prior decisions and found cognizable under\n\u00a71983 a claim that sought to \u201crender invalid the state procedures\nused to deny parole eligibility \u2026 and parole suitability.\u201dIIWe have not previously addressed\nwhether due process challenges to state collateral review\nprocedures may be brought under \u00a71983, and I would hold that they\nmay not. Challenges to all state procedures for reviewing the\nvalidity of a conviction should be treated the same as challenges\nto state trial procedures, which we have already recognized may not\nbe brought under \u00a71983. Moreover, allowing such challenges under\n\u00a71983 would undermine Congress\u2019 strict limitations on federal\nreview of state habeas decisions. If cognizable at all, Skinner\u2019s\nclaim sounds in habeas corpus.First, for the purposes of the\nDue Process Clause, the process of law for the deprivation of\nliberty comprises all procedures\u2014including collateral review\nprocedures\u2014that establish and review the validity of a conviction.\nThis has long been recognized for direct appellate review:\u201cAnd while the Fourteenth Amendment does not\nrequire that a State shall provide for an appellate review in\ncriminal cases, it is perfectly obvious that where such an appeal\nis provided for, and the prisoner has had the benefit of it, the\nproceedings in the appellate tribunal are to be regarded as part of\nthe process of law under which he is held in custody by the State,\nand to be considered in determining any question of alleged\ndeprivation of his life or liberty contrary to the Fourteenth\nAmendment.\u201dFrankv.Mangum,237 U. S. 309, 327\n(1915) (citations omitted).Similarly, although a State is not required to\nprovide procedures for postconviction review, it seems clear that\nwhen state collateral review procedures are provided for, they too\nare part of the \u201cprocess of law under which [a prisoner] is held in\ncustody by the State.\u201dIbid.As this Court has explained,\nwhen considering whether the State has provided all the process\nthat is due in depriving an individual of life, liberty, or\nproperty, we must look at both pre- and post-deprivation process.\nSeeCleveland Bd. of Ed.v.Loudermill,470 U. S. 532, 547,\nn.\u00a012 (1985) (\u201c[T]he existence of post-termination procedures\nis relevant to the necessary scope of pretermination procedures\u201d);\nsee alsoNational Private Truck Council, Inc.v.Oklahoma Tax Comm\u2019n,515 U. S. 582, 587\n(1995);Mathewsv.Eldridge,424 U. S. 319, 349\n(1976). There is no principled reason this Court should refuse to\nallow \u00a71983 suits to challenge part of this process\u2014the trial\nproceedings\u2014but bless the use of \u00a71983 to challenge other\nparts.Collateral review procedures are, of course,\n\u201cnot part of the criminal proceeding itself.\u201dPennsylvaniav.Finley,481 U. S. 551, 557\n(1987). But like trial and direct appellate procedures, they\nconcern the validity of the conviction. Trial procedures are used\nto initially convict a prisoner; appellate procedures review the\nvalidity of that conviction before it becomes final; and collateral\nreview procedures permit challenge to the conviction after it is\nfinal. For purposes of deciding which claims fall within the bounds\nof \u00a71983, I think it makes sense to treat similarly all\nconstitutional challenges to procedures concerning the validity of\na conviction. SeeHeck,supra, at 491 (Thomas,\nJ., concurring) (\u201c[I]t is proper for the Court to devise\nlimitations aimed at ameliorating the conflict [between habeas and\n\u00a71983], provided that it does so in a principled fashion\u201d).Second, \u201cprinciples of federalism and comity\n[are] at stake\u201d when federal courts review state collateral review\nprocedures, just as when they review state trial procedures.Osborne, 557 U. S., at ___ (Alito, J., concurring) (slip\nop., at 2). An attack in federal court on any \u201cstate judicial\naction\u201d concerning a state conviction must proceed with \u201cproper\nrespect for state functions,\u201d because the federal courts are being\nasked to \u201ctr[y] the regularity of proceedings had in courts of\ncoordinate jurisdiction.\u201dPreiser, 411 U. S., at 491\n(internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted).Because of these concerns for federal-state\ncomity, Congress has strictly limited the procedures for federal\nhabeas challenges to state convictions and state habeas decisions.\nCongress requires that before a state prisoner may seek relief in\nfederal court, he must \u201cexhaus[t] the remedies available in the\ncourts of the State.\u201d 28 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a72254(b)(1)(A). And state\nhabeas determinations receive significant deference in subsequent\nfederal habeas proceedings. \u00a72254(d). These requirements ensure\nthat the state courts have the first opportunity to correct any\nerror with a state conviction and that their rulings receive due\nrespect in subsequent federal challenges.By bringing a procedural challenge under\n\u00a71983, Skinner undermines these restrictions. For example, Skinner\nhas never presented his current challenge to Texas\u2019 procedures for\npostconviction relief to the Texas courts. Allowing Skinner to\nartfully plead an attack on state habeasproceduresinstead of an attack on state habeasresultsundercuts the\nrestrictions Congress and this Court have placed on federal review\nof state convictions. SeeOsborne,supra, at ___\n(Alito, J., concurring) (slip op., at 3). To allege that the Texas\ncourts erred in denying him relief on collateral review, Skinner\ncould only file a federal habeas petition, with its accompanying\nprocedural restrictions and deferential review. But a successful\nchallenge to Texas\u2019 collateral review procedures under \u00a71983 would\nimpeach the result of collateral review without complying with any\nof the restrictions for relief in federal habeas.The majority contends that its decision will\nnot \u201cspill over to claims relying onBradyv.Maryland,373 U. S. 83(1963).\u201dAnte, at 13; but cf.Osborne,supra, at\n___\u2013___ (Alito, J., concurring) (slip op., at 3\u20135). In truth, the\nmajority provides a roadmap for any unsuccessful state habeas\npetitioner to relitigate his claim under \u00a71983: After state habeas\nis denied, file a \u00a71983 suit challenging the state habeas process\nrather than the result. What prisoner would not avail himself of\nthis additional bite at the apple?[Footnote 3]IIIThe majority relies onDotsonto reach its conclusion. In that case, the\nplaintiffs alleged due process violations in state parole\nadjudications and sought injunctive relief and \u201ca new parole\nhearing conducted under constitutionally proper procedures.\u201d 544 U.\nS., at 77. We found the claims cognizable under \u00a71983.Dotsondoes not control\nthis case. Unlike state collateral review, parole does not evaluate\nthe validity of the underlying state conviction or sentence.\nCollateral review permits prisoners to \u201cattack their final\nconvictions.\u201dOsborne,supra, at ___ (Alito, J.,\nconcurring) (slip op., at 2). In contrast, parole may provide\nrelease, but whether or not a prisoner is paroled in no way relates\nto the validity of the underlying conviction or sentence. Whatever\nthe correctness ofDotson, parole procedures do not review\nthe validity of a conviction or sentence. For that reason,\npermitting review of parole procedures does not similarly risk\ntransforming \u00a71983 into a vehicle for \u201cchallenging the validity of\noutstanding criminal judgments.\u201dHeck, 512 U. S., at\n486.Contrary to the majority\u2019s contention,Dotsondid not reduce the question whether a claim is\ncognizable under \u00a71983 to a single inquiry into whether the\nprisoner\u2019s claim would \u201cnecessarily spell speedier release.\u201d Seeante, at 11, 12, n.\u00a012 (internal quotation marks\nomitted).[Footnote 4] As we\nrecognized inHeck, evaluating the boundaries of \u00a71983 is\nnot a narrow, mechanical inquiry. Even when the relief sought was\nnot \u201cspeedier release,\u201d we inquired further and returned to first\nprinciples to determine that the chal-lenge in that case was not\ncognizable under \u00a71983.[Footnote\n5] See 512 U. S., at 486.Dotsondoes not suggest that\ntheHeckapproach, which I would continue to follow here,\nwas incorrect.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*This Court has struggled to limit\n\u00a71983 and prevent it from intruding into the boundaries of habeas\ncorpus. In crafting these limits, we have recognized that suits\nseeking \u201cimmediate or speedier release\u201d from confinement fall\noutside its scope.Dotson,supra, at 82. We found\nanother limit when faced with a civil action in which \u201ca judgment\nin favor of the plaintiff would necessarily imply the invalidity of\nhis conviction or sentence.\u201dHeck,supra, at 487.\nThis case calls for yet another: due process challenges to state\nprocedures used to review the validity of a conviction or sentence.\nUnder that rule, Skinner\u2019s claim is not cognizable under \u00a71983, and\nthe judgment of the Court of Appeals should be affirmed. I\nrespectfully dissent.Footnote 1I adopt the majority\u2019s view that Skinner has\nalleged a violation of procedural due process despite the fact that\nhis complaint is more naturally read as alleging a violation ofsubstantivedue process. I also ignore the questionable\npremise that the requested relief\u2014DNA testing\u2014would be available in\na procedural due process challenge. CompareWilkinsonv.Dotson,544 U. S. 74, 77 (2005) (seeking \u201ca new\nparole hearing conducted under constitutionally proper\nprocedures\u201d), withOsborne, 557 U. S., at ___, n.\u00a01\n(Alito, J., concurring) (slip op., at 4, n.\u00a01) (distinguishingDotsonbecause Osborne sought \u201c\u00a0\u2018exculpatory\u2019\nevidence\u201d).Footnote 2Skinner challenges Texas\u2019 Article 64, Tex.\nCode Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 64.01et seq.(Vernon 2006 and\nSupp. 2010), which provides for postconviction discovery of DNA\nevidence that can then be used in a state habeas proceeding to\nchallenge the validity of a conviction. SeeArdv.State, 191 S.\u00a0W. 3d 342, 344 (Tex. App. 2006).\nArticle 64 does not itself \u201cprovide a vehicle for obtaining\nrelief,\u201dEx parte Tuley, 109 S.\u00a0W. 3d 388, 391 (Tex.\nCrim. App. 2002), but rather is by design and by nature part of\nTexas\u2019 collateral review procedures. See Reply Brief for Petitioner\n8 (\u201cBecause [Article 64] does not give the convicting court\nauthority to overturn a conviction, the prisoner still must bring a\nhabeas proceeding to challenge the conviction\u201d).Although Article 64 is, for the purposes of Skinner\u2019s due\nprocess challenge, part of the state collateral review process, I\ndo not suggest that a motion under Article 64 is an \u201capplication\nfor \u2026 collateral review\u201d under 28 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a72244(d)(2). SeeWallv.Kholi,post, at 10, n.\u00a04\n(noting that an application for review must \u201cprovide a state court\nwith authority to order relief from a judgment\u201d). Texas has divided\npostconviction discovery of DNA evidence and the application for\nstate habeas into separate proceedings, but both remain parts of\nthe State\u2019s collateral review process.Footnote 3Nor is there any reason to believe that the\nCourt\u2019s holding will be cabined to collateral review procedures.\nThe Court does not discuss whether a State\u2019s direct review process\nmay be subject to challenge under \u00a71983, but it suggests no\nprincipled distinction between direct and collateral review. This\nrisks transforming \u00a71983 into a vehicle for direct criminal\nappeals. Cf.Heckv.Humphrey,512 U. S. 477, 486 (1994). Just as any\nunsuccessful state habeas petitioner will now resort to \u00a71983 and\nchallenge state collateral review procedures, so, too, will\nunsuccessful appellants turn to \u00a71983 to challenge the state\nappellate procedures.Footnote 4Because parole procedures are unrelated to\nthe validity of a con-viction, a \u201cnecessarily spell speedier\nrelease\u201d test may sufficiently summarize the analysis of \u00a71983\nchallenges to parole procedures. But \u201cnecessarily spell speedier\nrelease\u201d cannot be the only limit when a prisoner challenges\nprocedures used to review the validity of the underlying\nconviction.Footnote 5As respondent argued, our existing\nformulations are not \u201cthe end of the test.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg.\n32\u201333.",
