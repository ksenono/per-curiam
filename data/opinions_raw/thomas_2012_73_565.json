    "text": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES_________________No. 10\u20138145_________________JUAN SMITH, PETITIONER v. BURL CAIN,\nWARDENon writ of certiorari to the orleans parish\ncriminal district court of louisiana[January 10, 2012]Justice Thomas,\ndissenting.The Court holds that\nJuan Smith is entitled to a new murder trial because the State, in\nviolation of Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.\u00a0S. 83 (1963) , did not\ndisclose that the eyewitness who identified Smith at trial stated\nshortly after the murders that he could not identify any of the\nperpetrators. I respectfully dissent. In my view, Smith has not\nshown a \u201creasonable probability\u201d that the jury would have been\npersuaded by the undisclosed evidence. United States v. Bagley, 473\nU.\u00a0S. 667, 682 (1985) (opinion of Blackmun, J.). That\nmateriality determination must be made \u201cin the context of the\nentire record,\u201d United States v. Agurs, 427 U.\u00a0S. 97, 112\n(1976) , and \u201cturns on the cumu- lative effect of all such evidence\nsuppressed by the government,\u201d Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.\u00a0S.\n419, 421 (1995) . Applying these principles, I would affirm the\njudgment of the Louisiana trial court.IThe evidence\npresented at trial showed the following facts. On March 1, 1995,\nLarry Boatner and several friends gathered at Rebe Espadron\u2019s home\nin New Or- leans. Boatner and others were drinking and talking in\nthe kitchen when Boatner heard the loud sound of a car without a\nmuffler outside. As Boatner opened the kitchen\u2019s outside door to\ninvestigate the noise, armed men pushed their way through the door,\ndemanding drugs and money. Tr. 153\u2013154 (Dec. 5, 1995). The first\nman though the door put a gun in Boatner\u2019s face and pushed him\nbackwards. Id., at 154\u2013155. The men initially ordered Boatner and\nhis friends to the floor, but then ordered Boatner to stand up. At\nthat time, the man who had been the first one through the door\nplaced his gun under Boatner\u2019s chin. Id., at 156\u2013157. When Boatner\nasked what the men wanted him to do, the first man struck Boatner\non the back of the head with his gun, knocking Boatner back to the\nground. Id., at 157\u2013158.After hearing the\ncommotion, Espadron emerged from a back bedroom, where she had been\nwhen the men entered the house. As Espadron opened an inside door\nleading to the kitchen, a man with a \u201ccovering\u201d over his mouth\npointed his gun at her face and ordered her to the floor. Id., at\n70\u201371. Disregarding his command, Espadron ran back toward the\nbedroom, at which point the intruders opened fire. Id., at 71\u201372,\n159.When the shooting was\nover, four people lay dead. A fifth person, 17-year-old Shelita\nRussell, was mortally wounded and died later at the hospital. Of\nthose originally gathered in the house, the only survivors were\nBoatner, who suffered a severe laceration to his head from the\nfirst man\u2019s blow but was otherwise uninjured; Espadron, who escaped\nunharmed; and Reginald Harbor, who had remained in a back bedroom\nduring the shooting. The police also found a man named Phillip\nYoung at the scene. Young was alive but had suffered a gunshot\nwound to the head. Because Boatner, Espadron, and Harbor had never\nseen Young before, the police surmised that Young had been one of\nthe perpetrators. [1]New Orleans police\nofficer Joseph Narcisse was a first responder to the scene of the\nshooting. He testified at trial that he encountered Boatner in the\nbathroom of Espadron\u2019s home, where Boatner was attempting to care\nfor the laceration to his head. According to Narcisse, \u201cMr.\nBoatner\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. had let inside the perpetrators and\ndid see them.\u201d Id., at 21 (Dec. 4, 1995). Narcisse further\nexplained that Boatner \u201chad a description\u201d of the person that he\nsaw, the details of which Narcisse could not recall. Id., at\n32.Detective John\nRonquillo, the lead investigator of the shootings, testified that\nBoatner had described the first man through the kitchen door as\nhaving a \u201cshort-type haircut,\u201d \u201ca lot of golds in his teeth,\u201d and\n\u201cbrown-ski[n].\u201d [2] Id., at\n115 (Dec. 5, 1995). Ronquillo further testified that Boatner could\ndescribe no other perpetrator, but that Boatner had viewed the\nfirst man twice: once when the man initially came through the door\nand again when Boatner was ordered to stand up and the man held a\ngun to his chin. Id., at 117\u2013118.Ronquillo also\ntestified that, during the four months following the shootings,\nBoatner viewed 14 six-person photograph arrays of potential\nsuspects\u2014only one of which contained a picture of Smith. Id., at\n89\u2013100. Three weeks after the crime, Ronquillo presented Boatner\nwith one of the arrays that did not include a picture of Smith.\nRonquillo recalled that Boatner noted that one man in the array had\na \u201csimilar haircut\u201d and \u201ca similar expression on his face\u201d as the\n\u201cgentleman that came into the house initially with the gun that\n[Boatner] confronted,\u201d but that Boatner \u201cwas positive this wasn\u2019t\nthe individual.\u201d Id., at 97; see also 5 Record 828. A few months\nlater, Ronquillo presented Boatner with the array that included a\nphotograph of Smith. Tr. 99\u2013101 (Dec. 5, 1995). Ronquillo testified\nthat Boatner identified Smith \u201cimmediately,\u201d stating, \u201c\u00a0\u2018This\nis it. I\u2019ll never forget that face.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Id., at 100. Of the 84\nphotographs that Boatner viewed, Smith\u2019s photograph was the only\none that Boatner identified.Boatner identified\nSmith again when he was called to the stand during Smith\u2019s trial.\nBoatner testified that Smith\u2019s face was the \u201c[s]ame face,\u201d id., at\n174, and that Smith\u2019s mouth was the \u201c[s]ame mouth\u201d \u201cfull of gold,\u201d\nibid., as that of the first man who came through the kitchen door\non the night of the attack. Boatner also testified that Smith\u2019s\nhair at trial was \u201cshaved on the sides\u201d as it was during the crime,\nbut that \u201cthe top was a little bit lower\u201d at the time of the\nmurders. Id., at 165. Boatner explain- ed that, during the attack,\nhe had focused on the first man through the door\u2014who was\nunmasked\u2014but that he \u201cdidn\u2019t notice\u201d the faces of any of the other\nassailants or whether they were masked. Id., at 154. On\ncross-examination, Boatner testified that he had described the\nfirst man\u2019s build, haircut, and gold teeth jewelry to the police.\nId., at 178.Based on this evidence,\nthe jury convicted Smith of first-degree murder. Following the\nconclusion of direct review, Smith petitioned the trial court for\npostconviction relief. Smith argued that the State had failed to\ndisclose various police notes revealing favorable evidence material\nto Smith\u2019s guilt. As relevant here, those items include pretrial\nstatements by Boatner; statements by victim Shelita Russell and\nEspadron\u2019s neighbor, Dale Mims; a pretrial statement by firearms\nexaminer Kenneth Leary; statements by cosuspect Robert Trackling\nand Trackling\u2019s fellow inmate, Eric Rogers; and a statement by\ncosuspect Phillip Young. After holding a 4-day evidentiary hearing,\nthe postconviction judge\u2014who had also presided over Smith\u2019s 2-day\ntrial\u2014denied Smith\u2019s Brady claims.Like the postconviction\ncourt below, I conclude that Smith is not entitled to a new trial\nunder Brady. In my view, Smith has not established a reasonable\nprobability that the cumulative effect of this evidence would have\ncaused the jury to change its verdict.IIASmith first\nidentifies two undisclosed statements by Boatner, which the Court\nconcludes are \u201cplainly material.\u201d Ante, at 3. First, a note by\nRonquillo, documenting a conversation he had with Boatner at the\nscene, states that Boatner \u201ccould not\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. supply a\ndescription of the perpetrators other th[a]n they were black\nmales.\u201d 5 Record 809. Second, a handwritten note by Ronquillo,\ndocumenting a phone conversation he had with Boatner on March 6,\nfive days after the murders, states that\n\u201cBoatner\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. could not ID anyone because couldn\u2019t\nsee faces\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. glanced at 1st one\u2014saw man\u2014through\ndoor\u2014can\u2019t tell if had\u2014faces covered didn\u2019t see\nanyone\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. Could not ID\u2014would not know them if\u2014I\nsaw them.\u201d 13 id., at 2515. Ronquillo\u2019s typed summary of this note\nstates that Boatner advised him that he \u201ccould not identify any\nperpetrators of the murder.\u201d 5 id., at 817.Smith is correct that\nthese undisclosed statements could have been used to impeach\nBoatner and Ronquillo during cross-examination. But the statements\nare not material for purposes of Brady because they cannot\n\u201creasonably be taken to put the whole case in such a different\nlight as to undermine confidence in the verdict.\u201d Kyles, 514\nU.\u00a0S., at 435. When weighed against the substantial evidence\nthat Boatner had opportunities to view the first perpetrator,\noffered consistent descriptions of him on multiple occasions, and\neven identified him as Smith, the undisclosed statements do not\nwarrant a new trial.The evidence showed\nthat, notwithstanding Ronquillo\u2019s on-scene note, Boatner offered a\ndescription of the perpetrator at the scene. Officer Narcisse\ntestified that Boatner provided him with a description of the\nperpetrator that Boatner saw. Narcisse\u2019s testimony thus\ncorroborated Boatner\u2019s trial testimony that he saw the first man\nand described him to police. [3] Narcisse\u2019s testimony also mitigated the impeachment\nvalue of Ronquillo\u2019s on-scene note by indicating that, although\nBoatner may have provided no detailed description to Ronquillo at\nthe scene, Boatner had described the first man to another officer.\n[4]In any event,\nRonquillo\u2019s notes reflect that Boatner provided a description of\nthe first perpetrator at the police station only a few hours after\nthe shootings occurred. Tr. 403 (Jan. 22, 2009). Boatner was asked\nif he could \u201cdescribe the subjects wh[o] shot the people in the\nhouse.\u201d 5 Record 866. He responded: \u201cI can tell you about one, the\none who put the pistol in my face, he was a black male with a low\ncut, gold[s] in his mouth\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. about my complexion,\nbrown skinned.\u201d Ibid. When asked, \u201c[Y]ou say you can\u2019t describe any\nof the other shooters besides the one who put the gun in your face\nafter you opened the door,\u201d Boatner replied, \u201cNo, I can\u2019t.\u201d Ibid.\nIn his brief, Smith cites this station house statement as an\nexample of favorable, undisclosed evidence. But this statement\nactually corroborates Boatner\u2019s trial testimony that he saw and\ndescribed the first perpetrator to police and that he did not get a\ngood look at the other assailants. Moreover, the description\nBoatner provided was consistent with Smith\u2019s appearance. The Court\ncompletely ignores Boatner\u2019s station house statement, but our cases\ninstruct us to evaluate \u201cthe net effect of the evidence withheld by\nthe State\u201d in assessing materiality. See Kyles, supra, at\n421\u2013422.The evidence not only\nshows that Boatner described the first perpetrator twice in the\nimmediate aftermath of the crime, but also that Boatner described\nhim again three weeks later when he viewed a photograph array and\neliminated a similar-looking individual. The evidence before the\njury further indicated that, several months after the crime,\nBoatner confidently identified Smith in an array, after evincing a\ndiscriminating, careful eye over a 4-month investigative period.\nWhat is more, the reliability of Boatner\u2019s out-of-court\nidentification was extensively tested during cross-examination at\nSmith\u2019s trial. In particular, Boatner was asked whether the fact\nthat he saw Smith\u2019s picture in a newspaper article naming Smith as\na suspect had tainted his identification. Boatner did not waiver,\nresponding, \u201cI picked out the person I seen come in that house that\nheld a gun to my head and under my chin and the person that was\nthere when all my friends died.\u201d Tr. 190 (Dec. 5, 1995). That\nBoatner credibly rejected defense counsel\u2019s \u201csuggestion\u201d theory is\nsupported by the fact that Boatner did not identify cosuspect\nRobert Trackling\u2014whose photograph was included in a separate array\nshown to Boatner on the same day that Boatner identified Smith\u2014even\nthough Trackling\u2019s picture was next to Smith\u2019s in the same\nnewspaper article. 5 Record 833, 835.When weighed against\nBoatner\u2019s repeated and consistent descriptions and confident\nout-of-court and in-court identifications, Boatner\u2019s March 6\nstatement is also immaterial. As an initial matter, Ronquillo\u2019s\nnote of his March 6 conversation with Boatner contains an internal\ncontradiction that undercuts its impeachment value. Although the\nnote states that Boatner \u201cdidn\u2019t see anyone,\u201d it also states that\nBoatner \u201cglanced at 1st one\u2014saw man\u2014through door.\u201d 13 id., at 2515.\nThe latter part is consistent with Boatner\u2019s repeated statements\nthat he only saw the first man through the door. Moreover, the jury\nwould have evaluated any equivocation in Boatner\u2019s statement in\nlight of the fact that he made it a mere five days after a\ntraumatic shooting, when the perpetrators were still at large. The\njury would have considered Boatner\u2019s trial testimony that,\nfollowing the murders of his friends, he began having nightmares,\nhad difficulty sleeping, quit his job, and began drinking\nheavily\u2014so much so that he checked into a hospital for substance\nabuse treatment and grief counseling. Tr. 162\u2013163, 170\u2013171, 182\n(Dec. 5, 1995). Any impeachment value in the March 6 note would\nhave been further mitigated by the fact that, as Ronquillo\nexplained, \u201con the night of the incident [Boatner] said that he\ncould [identify someone] and he gave a description that was very\nclose to Mr. Smith\u2019s description.\u201d Id., at 401 (Jan. 22, 2009).\nAnd, following his March 6 conversation with Ronquillo, Boatner\nviewed numerous photograph arrays, described the first perpetrator,\nand ultimately identified him as Smith.Of course, had the jury\nbeen presented with Ronquillo\u2019s notes of Boatner\u2019s on-scene and\nMarch 6 statements, it might have believed that Boatner could not\nidentify any of the perpetrators, but a possibility of a different\nverdict is insufficient to establish a Brady violation. See\nStrickler v. Greene, 527 U.\u00a0S. 263, 291 (1999) ; see also\nAgurs, 427 U.\u00a0S., at 109\u2013110 (\u201cThe mere possibility that an\nitem of undisclosed information might have helped the defense, or\nmight have affected the outcome of the trial, does not es- tablish\n\u2018materiality\u2019 in the constitutional sense.\u201d Rather, a \u201cpetitioner\u2019s\nburden is to establish a reasonable prob- ability of a different\nresult.\u201d Strickler, supra, at 291.Instead of requiring\nSmith to show a reasonable probability that Boatner\u2019s undisclosed\nstatements would have caused the jury to acquit, the Court\nimproperly requires the State to show that the jury would have\ngiven Boatner\u2019s undisclosed statements no weight. See ante, at 3\n(\u201c[T]he State\u2019s argument offers a reason that the jury could have\ndisbelieved Boatner\u2019s undisclosed statements, but gives us no\nconfidence that it would have done so\u201d). But Smith is not entitled\nto a new trial simply because the jury could have accorded some\nweight to Boatner\u2019s undisclosed statements. Smith\u2019s burden is to\nshow a reasonable probability that the jury would have accorded\nthose statements sufficient weight to alter its verdict. In light\nof the record as a whole\u2014which the Court declines to consider\u2014Smith\nhas not carried that burden.BSmith also argues\nthat statements by Shelita Russell and Dale Mims documented in\nRonquillo\u2019s handwritten notes could have been used to impeach\nBoatner\u2019s identification of Smith because the statements indicate\nthat the perpetrators were masked. One undated note, which contains\nseveral entries about various aspects of the investigation, states,\n\u201cfemale\u2014face down against cabinets\u2014conscious.\u201d On the next line,\nthe note continues, \u201csaid\u2014in kitchen saw people barge in\u2014one\u2014black\ncloth across face\u2014first one through door\u2014[no further statement].\u201d\n13 Record 2556. When cross-examined during the postconviction\nhearing about whether this note documented the statement of\nRussell, Ronquillo confirmed that the note was in his handwriting,\nbut he testified that he never talked to Russell, that he did not\nknow when the note was made, and that someone else could have\nrelayed the information to him. Tr. 415\u2013418 (Jan. 22, 2009). [5] I will assume arguendo\nthat, had this note been disclosed, it would have been admissible\nat Smith\u2019s trial as a dying declaration of Russell. [6] But the note would have had minimal\nimpeachment value because, contrary to Smith\u2019s assertions, it is\nambiguous in light of the context in which the statement was made.\nOfficer Narcisse testified that Russell was conscious and able to\ntalk, but that she was in \u201cbad condition.\u201d Id., at 20 (Dec. 4,\n1995). Similarly, Reg- inald Harbor testified that, as Russell lay\nwounded, she was \u201cwhining\u201d and he \u201cdidn\u2019t catch nothing [t]hat she\nsaid.\u201d Id., at 205 (Dec. 5, 1995). And, although Smith contends\nthat the note says \u201cexactly\u201d that the \u201cfirst person through the\ndoor had a black cloth across his face,\u201d that is not how the note\nreads. Reply Brief for Petitioner 11 (emphasis deleted; internal\nquotation marks omitted) (hereinafter Reply Brief). The note first\nstates that the declarant \u201csaw people barge in,\u201d then states\n\u201cone\u2014black cloth across face\u2014first one through door\u2014[no further\nstatement].\u201d 13 Record 2556 (emphasis added). It is at least as\nlogical to read this statement as indicating only that \u201cone\u201d of the\n\u201cpeople\u201d had a \u201cblack cloth across [his] face.\u201d Russell, suffering\nfrom fatal wounds, said nothing further after \u201cfirst one through\ndoor,\u201d and it is impossible to know whether the \u201cfirst one\u201d was\nalso the \u201cone\u201d with a \u201cblack cloth across [his] face.\u201dThe second statement\nSmith identifies is that of Dale Mims, who lived down the street\nfrom Espadron\u2019s home and who heard the shooting. A note by\nRonquillo states that Mims saw four males fleeing Espadron\u2019s home,\n\u201call wearing mask[s].\u201d Id., at 2518. Like Russell\u2019s purported\nstatement, this statement has minimal impeachment value in light of\nthe record. Mims\u2019 undisclosed statement does not address whether\nsome or all of the perpetrators were masked inside Espadron\u2019s home.\n[7] Moreover, had Mims been\ncalled as a witness at trial, he presumably would have testified,\nas he did at the postconviction hearing, that he was \u201cpositive\u201d\nthat he only saw three perpetrators fleeing, and that, of those\nthree, only two were masked. Tr. 269, 271\u2013273, 275 (Jan. 13,\n2009).Both Russell\u2019s\npurported statement and Mims\u2019 testimony are consistent with\nBoatner\u2019s testimony that he did not know whether any of the other\nperpetrators were masked, id., at 154 (Dec. 5, 1995), and with\nOfficer Narcisse\u2019s and Espadron\u2019s testimony that the single\nperpetrator whom Espadron observed was wearing some sort of face\ncover- ing, id., at 30\u201331 (Dec. 4, 1995); id., at 71 (Dec. 5,\n1995). Thus, the totality of the evidence indicates that some, but\nnot all, of the perpetrators were masked, a conclusion that in no\nway undermines Boatner\u2019s consistent assertions that the only\nperpetrator he saw was unmasked.CSmith also contends\nthat Ronquillo\u2019s undisclosed note documenting a pretrial statement\nby firearms examiner Kenneth Leary is material for purposes of\nBrady. The note states that \u201cLeary advised Ronquillo that the 9MM\nammunition confiscated from [the scene of the murders] was typed to\nhave been fired from a[n] [Intratec], \u2018Mac[-] 11\u2019 model type, semi\nautomatic weapon.\u201d 5 Record 831. According to Smith, this statement\nconflicts with Leary\u2019s trial testimony that the 9-millimeter\nammunition found at the scene \u201cwas fired by one particular weapon,\none 9-millimeter handgun,\u201d Tr. 132 (Dec. 5, 1995), because an\nIntratec or Mac-11 pistol is not a \u201chandgun.\u201d Smith further argues\nthat Leary\u2019s pretrial statement could have been used to exculpate\nSmith, whose guilt the prosecution attempted to show by calling a\npathologist to testify that Shelita Russell\u2019s wounds could have\nbeen inflicted by a 9-millimeter \u201chandgun,\u201d id., at 39 (Dec. 4,\n1995), and by calling Boatner to testify that the gun Smith held\nunder his chin was a 9-millimeter silver \u201chand gun,\u201d id., at 157\n(Dec. 5, 1995).Contrary to Smith\u2019s\ncontentions, Leary\u2019s pretrial statement does not undermine the\nevidence presented at trial. Leary\u2019s pretrial statement is\nconsistent with his and Boatner\u2019s trial testimony because an\nIntratec or Mac11 pistol is a 9-millimeter handgun. Smith concedes\nthat such a weapon uses 9-millimeter cartridges. Brief for\nPetitioner 48. Moreover, a \u201chandgun\u201d is simply \u201c[a] firearm that\ncan be used with one hand,\u201d American Heritage Dictionary 819 (3d\ned. 1992), and no one disputes that an Intratec or Mac-11 pistol\ncan be used with one hand. Smith nonetheless insists that, \u201cas a\ncolloquial matter, machine pistols of the Intratec or MAC-11 type\nwould be considered automatic or semiautomatic weapons, rather than\nhandguns.\u201d Reply Brief 18. But even assuming that Smith is correct,\nhe fails to explain why Leary, a firearms expert, would have been\nexpected to use colloquial rather than technical terminology. [8]The record also makes\nclear that, when Boatner used the term \u201chandgun,\u201d he did not\nunderstand it to exclude automatic or semiautomatic machine\npistols. In the immediate aftermath of the murders, as well as at\ntrial, Boatner stated that a second perpetrator carried a \u201cMa[c]\n10\u201d or \u201cTech Nine\u201d \u201cUzi\u201d type weapon, Tr. 159, 179 (Dec. 5, 1995);\n5 Record 809, 813, 866, and Boatner described that weapon as a\n\u201chandgun,\u201d id., at 809. Moreover, Boatner\u2019s pretrial description of\nthe silver or chrome \u201chandgun\u201d that the first man held was\nconsistent with Leary\u2019s undisclosed statement that the gun that\nfired the 9-millimeter ammunition found at the scene was a\nsemiautomatic weapon. In his station house statement, Boatner\ndescribed the first man\u2019s weapon as a \u201cbig,\u201d \u201cautomatic pistol.\u201d\nId., at 813, 866. Because Leary\u2019s pretrial statement is neither\nimpeaching nor exculpatory, Leary\u2019s undisclosed statement cannot\nform the basis of a Brady violation. See Strickler, 527 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 281\u2013282 (To make out a Brady viola- tion, \u201c[t]he evidence at\nissue must be favorable to the accused, either because it is\nexculpatory, or because it is impeaching\u201d).DSmith next points to\npurportedly exculpatory and ma- terial undisclosed pretrial\nstatements made by Robert Trackling, a member of the \u201cCut Throat\nPosse\u201d street gang with which Smith was allegedly associated, and\nby Eric Rogers, an inmate who was incarcerated with Trackling. 5\nRecord 845. Police notes reflect that Eric Rogers gave an interview\nto investigators on May 19, 1995, during which he described a\nconversation that he had with Trackling while in prison. During\nthat conversation, Trackling described the murders at Espadron\u2019s\nhome and stated that he had committed the crime along with \u201cFat,\nBuckle, and a guy they call uh, Short Dog.\u201d Id., at 841. According\nto Rogers, Fat\u2019s real name was \u201cDarnell [Donielle] Banister,\u201d\nBuckle\u2019s real name was \u201cContez [Kintad] Phillips,\u201d and Short Dog\u2019s\nreal name was \u201cJuan.\u201d Id., at 843\u2013844.Smith contends that\nRogers\u2019 interview was exculpatory in two respects. First, he points\nto the following comment by Rogers later during the interview:\n\u201cThey call Contez Philip Buckle, they call Darnell Banister Fat,\nShort Dog that\u2019s what they call him, they call Robert Home.\u201d Id.,\nat 845. Smith suggests that Rogers\u2019 prior identification of \u201cShort\nDog\u201d as \u201cJuan [Smith]\u201d was equivocal in light of his later\nstatement that \u201cShort Dog\u201d was a man named \u201cRobert Home.\u201d Reply\nBrief 21. Second, Smith asserts that disclosure of Rogers\u2019\ninterview would have led the defense and the jury to learn of\nRogers\u2019 allegation\u2014made for the first time 10 years after Smith\u2019s\ntrial\u2014that the police had asked him to implicate Juan Smith as\n\u201cShort Dog,\u201d Tr. 284\u2013285 (Jan. 13, 2009).Neither argument is\npersuasive. If the jury had learned of Rogers\u2019 statement, it would\nhave heard information directly inculpating Smith as \u201cShort Dog,\u201d a\nperpetrator of the shootings. Rogers\u2019 physical description of\n\u201cShort Dog\u201d\u2014\u201che[\u2019s] short[,] he[\u2019s] got golds going across his\nmouth[,] and .\u00a0.\u00a0. he\u2019s like built,\u201d 5 Record 844\u2013also\ncorroborated Boatner\u2019s description of the first man through the\ndoor as having a \u201cmouth full of gold\u201d and a \u201cheavy\u201d build.\nFurthermore, Smith ignores other inculpatory information documented\nin Ronquillo\u2019s notes of Rogers\u2019 statement. Those notes reflect\nTrackling\u2019s own interview with police on June 1, 1995, in which\nTrackling identified Phillips, Bannister, and \u201cJuan Smith\u201d as the\nperpetrators of the murders at Espadron\u2019s home. Id., at 832; see\nalso id., at 854\u2013855. Trackling\u2019s statement only strengthens the\ninculpatory nature of Rogers\u2019 interview.Further, the jury\nassuredly would not have believed Smith\u2019s suggestion that Rogers\nidentified \u201cShort Dog\u201d as a man named \u201cRobert Home.\u201d When this\nstatement is taken in context, it appears that Rogers was\ndescribing the nickname\u2014\u201cHome\u201d [9] \u2014of Robert Trackling, the \u201cRobert\u201d whom Rogers had\nrepeatedly referenced throughout his interview. See id., at\n839\u2013850. Indeed, Rogers\u2019 phrase- ology, \u201cthey call Robert Home,\u201d\nwas consistent with his pre- vious comments that \u201c[t]hey call\nContez Philip Buckle,\u201d and \u201cthey call Darnell Banister Fat.\u201d Id.,\nat 845 (emphasis added). Unsurprisingly, in the thousands of pages\nof record material, I have not found, nor have the parties cited, a\nsingle reference to anyone named \u201cRobert Home.\u201dIf the jury had heard\nRogers\u2019 postconviction testimony that police asked him to implicate\nSmith and that Trackling\u2019s description of the murders did not\ninclude Smith, Tr. 284\u2013285 (Jan. 13, 2009), it would have weighed\nRogers\u2019 allegation against Trackling\u2019s own statement to the police\nthat Smith had participated in the murders at Espadron\u2019s home, 5\nRecord 832. The prosecution also would have called Smith\u2019s sister,\nTrinieze Smith, to testify that she believed her brother was known\nas \u201cShort Dog,\u201d as she did at the postconviction hearing. Tr. 371\n(Jan. 14, 2009). On this record, the undisclosed statements by\nRogers and Trackling actually strengthen rather than weaken\nconfidence in the jury\u2019s guilty verdict. [10]EFinally, Smith argues\nthat an undisclosed handwritten note by Ronquillo documenting a\nstatement by Phillip Young\u2014the man found injured at the scene and\nsuspected of having participated in the crime\u2014is also material\nevidence warranting a new trial. At trial, Ronquillo testified that\nhe met with Young while Young was hospitalized as a result of\npermanent brain damage suffered in the shoot- ings. Id., at 102\n(Dec. 5, 1995). According to Ronquillo, Young \u201cwas strapped to a\nchair. He really couldn\u2019t talk, [h]e mumbled. He could use his left\nhand, that was all. He couldn\u2019t walk or anything. He was fed\nthrough a tube by the people there. He was in really bad shape.\u201d\nId., at 102\u2013103. When asked whether Young was able to communicate\nwith him \u201cat all,\u201d Ronquillo responded, \u201cNo. I couldn\u2019t understand\nanything that he was saying.\u201d Id., at 103.The undisclosed note\nfrom Ronquillo\u2019s meeting with Young reads as follows: \u201cShort\nDog/Bucko/Fats\u2014No\u2014Didn\u2019t shoot me\u2014No\u2014Not with me when went to\nhouse\u2014Yes\u2014one of people in house shot me\u2014No\u2014Not\nresponsible\u2014\u2018Posse\u2019\u2014Didn\u2019t drive to house\u2014\u2018Posse\u2019\u2014Yes\u2014Knows names\nof perps\u2014Yes\u2014Drove in car\u2014Yes\u2014girlfriend\u2019s car.\u201d 13 Record 2568.\nSmith contends that this note is exculpatory in that it suggests\nthat he was \u201cnot involved\u201d in the shootings. Brief for Petitioner\n43.Young\u2019s statement is\nonly exculpatory if Smith concedes (as the statement asserts) that\nhe is, in fact, \u201cShort Dog\u201d and a member of the \u201cCut Throat Posse.\u201d\nSuch a concession would only have strengthened the inculpatory\nvalue of the statements by Rogers and Trackling indicating that\nSmith was the \u201cShort Dog\u201d who committed the murders at Espadron\u2019s\nhome. In any event, the exculpatory value of the note is minimal\nfor several other reasons. First, it is unclear whether Ronquillo\u2019s\nnote reflects a statement by Young that the \u201cPosse\u201d was not\nresponsible for shooting the victims or a statement that the\n\u201cPosse\u201d was not responsible for shooting Young. Further, the\nstatement that \u201cShort Dog\u201d and others were not with Young when he\nwent to the house is certainly not a clear statement that \u201cShort\nDog\u201d did not commit the murders, especially in light of evidence in\nthe record that the assailants used two cars on the night of the\nmurders. [11] Second, had\nthe jury learned of Ronquillo\u2019s note, it would have presumably\nheard Ronquillo testify, as he did at the postconviction hearing,\nthat he was not even sure whether his note actually reflected\nstatements by Young, given that Young \u201ccouldn\u2019t talk,\u201d was\n\u201cjumbled,\u201d could only \u201ckind of move his head,\u201d and sometimes would\njust sit and stare when Ronquillo asked a question. [12] Tr. 423\u2013424 (Jan. 22, 2009).\nAccordingly, Ronquillo explained, \u201cI never had hide nor hair\nactually of what [Young] said.\u201d Id., at 423.The jury thus would\nhave evaluated Ronquillo\u2019s note, of unclear exculpatory value on\nits face, against a backdrop of doubt as to what, if anything,\nYoung actually communicated. The jury also would have weighed this\nevidence against the strongly inculpatory nature of Boatner\u2019s\ndescriptions and identifications and Rogers\u2019 and Trackling\u2019s\nstatements, which corroborated Boatner\u2019s identification. When all\nof the evidence is considered cumulatively, as it must be, Smith\nhas not shown a reasonable probability that the jury would have\nreached a different verdict.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*The question\npresented here is not whether a prudent prosecutor should have\ndisclosed the information that Smith identifies. Rather, the\nquestion is whether the cu- mulative effect of the disclosed and\nundisclosed evidence in Smith\u2019s case \u201cput[s] the whole case in such\na different light as to undermine confidence in the verdict.\u201d\nKyles, 514 U.\u00a0S., at 435. When, as in this case, the Court\ndeparts from its usual practice of declining to review alleged\nmisapplications of settled law to particular facts, id., at 456\n(Scalia, J., joined by Rehnquist, C.\u00a0J., and Kennedy and\nThomas, JJ., dissenting), the Court should at least consider all of\nthe facts. And, the Court certainly should not decline to review\nall of the facts on the assumption that the remainder of the record\nwould only further support Smith\u2019s claims, as the Court appears to\nhave done here. Ante, at 3\u20134.Such an assumption is\nincorrect. Here, much of the record evidence confirms that, from\nthe night of the murders through trial, Boatner consistently\ndescribed\u2014with one understandable exception\u2014the first perpetrator\nthrough the door, that Boatner\u2019s description matched Smith, and\nthat Boatner made strong out-of-court and in-court identifications\nimplicating Smith. Some of the undisclosed evidence cited by Smith\nis not favorable to him at all, either because it is of no\nimpeachment or exculpa- tory value or because it actually\ninculpates him. Because what remains is evidence of such minimal\nimpeachment and exculpatory value as to be immaterial in light of\nthe whole record, I must dissent from the Court\u2019s holding that the\nState violated Brady.Notes1Young was indicted along\nwith Smith for the murders, but he was deemed incompetent to stand\ntrial due to the brain damage he sufferedas a result of being shot.\n1 Record 49.2\u201cGolds\u201d are permanent or\nremovable mouth jewelry, also referred to as \u201cgrills.\u201d See Mouth\nJewelry Wearers Love Gleam of the Grill, South Florida\nSun-Sentinel, Feb. 4, 2007, p.\u00a05, 2007 WLNR 2187080. See also\nA. Westbrook, Hip Hoptionary 59 (2002) (defining a \u201cgrill\u201d as a\n\u201cteeth cover, usually made of gold and diamonds\u201d).3In a pretrial hearing,\nBoatner testified that he \u201cgave a descriptionto the officer that\ncame to the scene.\u201d Tr. 24 (Oct. 27, 1995). Boatner responded\nnegatively when asked whether this officer was Detective Ronquillo.\nIbid. Boatner further testified that he told the officer that the\nfirst man through the door was \u201cheavy built with his hair with a\nfade, with a little small top with a lot of gold teeth in his\nmouth.\u201d Ibid. That testimony was consistent with the testimony that\nBoatner and Officer Narcisse gave at trial.4Moreover, Boatner\u2019s\nreticence toward Ronquillo at the scene of the crime was entirely\nunderstandable. As Ronquillo noted at the postconviction hearing,\n\u201cthere were dead bodies everywhere,\u201d and Boatner was \u201ca little\nshook up.\u201d Id., at 402\u2013403 (Jan. 22, 2009). Similarly, Narcisse\ntestified at trial that Boatner, while \u201cnot as frantic\u201d as\nEspadron, was a \u201cbit emotional\u201d when Narcisse encountered him at\nthe scene. Id., at 34 (Dec. 4, 1995).5Russell did not make this\nstatement to Officer Narcisse. He testified that Russell \u201cwas not\nable to give us any information or any details of what had\nhappened.\u201d Id., at 20.6Louisiana law provides\nthat \u201c[a] statement made by a declarant while believing that his\ndeath was imminent, concerning the cause or circumstances of what\nhe believed to be his impending death[,]\u201d is \u201cnot excluded by the\nhearsay rule if the declarant is unavailable as a witness.\u201d La.\nCode Evid. Ann., Art. 804(B)(2) (West Supp. 2012). Assuming this\nstatement was actually Russell\u2019s, it likely qualifies as a dying\ndeclaration. At trial, Boatner testified that, in the aftermath of\nthe shooting, Russell told him, \u201cFeel like I\u2019m about to die.\u201d Tr.\n161 (Dec. 5, 1995) (internal quotation marks omitted). Espadron\nalso testified that Russell told her, \u201cI\u2019m gonna die,\u201d and, \u201cDon\u2019t\nlet me die.\u201d Id., at 73\u201374 (internal quotation marks\nomitted).7Smith ridicules the\n\u201cexceedingly peculiar\u201d notion that the perpetrators would have\nremained unmasked inside Espadron\u2019s home, only to mask themselves\nbefore leaving the scene. Reply Brief 12\u201313. But that notion is\neminently reasonable if the perpetrators intended to massacre the\nwitnesses who were inside the home\u2014as they did\u2014and were concerned\nonly with disguising themselves from neighbors outside who might\nsee or hear the burglary.8Smith argues that Leary\nhimself considered an \u201c[Intratec] or \u2018Mac[-]11\u2019\u00a0\u201d model type\nto be different from a 9-millimeter handgun. Smith relies on the\nfact that Leary\u2019s pretrial statement indicated that the ammunition\nrecovered from the scene did not come from the handgun recovered\nfrom Donielle Bannister, another suspect in the murders. Id., at\n18. Leary\u2019s pretrial statement did not describe the handgun\nrecovered from Bannister as a 9-millimeter, contrary to Smith\u2019s\nrepresentation. More importantly, Leary\u2019s statement suggests only\nthat Bannister\u2019s handgun did not fire the 9-millimeter ammunition\nfound at the scene, not that Leary did not consider an \u201c[Intratec]\nor \u2018Mac[-]11\u2019\u00a0\u201d model type to be a handgun.9See 2 Dictionary of\nAmerican Regional English 1064\u20131065, 1069 (F. Cassidy & J. Hall\neds. 1991) (defining \u201cHome\u201d as \u201ca term of address used by two black\npeople either from the same Southern state or simply from the\nSouth,\u201d similar to \u201chomey\u201d or \u201chome boy\u201d); 2 Green\u2019s Dictionary of\nSlang 828 (2010) (defining \u201chome,\u201d an abbreviation of homeboy, as\n\u201ca friend, often used in direct address\u201d); Concise New Partridge\nDictionary of Slang and Unconventional English (T. Dalzell & T.\nVictor eds. 2008) (defining \u201chome\u201d as \u201ca very close male friend,\u201d\nan abbreviation of \u201cHomeboy\u201d).10Detective Byron Adams, who took\nRogers\u2019 statement, did not testify at the postconviction hearing\nbecause he had died in the meantime. He thus had no opportunity to\naddress Rogers\u2019 recantation or his newly minted allegation that\nDetective Adams asked Rogers to implicate Smith. Smith argues that\n\u201cthere is no reason to believe that\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. Adams\nwould have contradicted Rogers\u2014much less that the jury would have\nbelieved [him] if [he] did.\u201d Reply Brief 21. But Smith offers no\nsupport for his dubious assertion that Detective Adams would have\nadmitted to framing Smith, or that, had the detective denied the\nallegation, the jury would have believed Rogers\u2014a convicted\nmurderer who never explained any motive Adams would have had to\nframe Smith\u2014over the detective.11In\nhis station house statement, Boatner explained that the loud car\nthat arrived at Espadron\u2019s home was white. 5 Record 866. In Rogers\u2019\ninterview with the police, Rogers said that Trackling escaped from\nEspadron\u2019s home in a burgundy car. Id., at 842.12Smith\nalso contends that the defense could have used the undisclosed note\nto impeach Ronquillo\u2019s trial testimony that Young was not able to\ncommunicate with him \u201cat all.\u201d That argument lacks merit.\nRonquillo\u2019s trial testimony, when read in context, does not suggest\nthat no communication occurred. Rather, Ronquillo made clear that\nhe simply \u201ccouldn\u2019t understand anything that [Young] was saying.\u201d\nSee Tr. 103 (Dec. 5, 1995) (emphasis added). That testimony is\nconsistent with the garbled nature of the note, and the note thus\nwould have had little, if any, impeachment value.",
