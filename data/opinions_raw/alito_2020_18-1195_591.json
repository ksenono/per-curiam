The\nbasis of the decision below was a Montana constitutional provision\nthat, according to the Montana Supreme Court, forbids parents from\nparticipating in a publicly funded scholarship program simply\nbecause they send their children to religious schools. Regardless\nof the motivation for this provision or its predecessor, its\napplication here violates the Free Exercise Clause.Nevertheless, the provision\u2019s origin is relevant\nunder the decision we issued earlier this Term inRamosv.Louisiana, 590 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2020). The question inRamoswas whether Louisiana and Oregon laws allowing\nnon-unanimous jury verdicts in criminal trials violated the Sixth\nAmendment. The Court held that they did, emphasizing that the\nStates originally adopted those laws for racially discriminatory\nreasons. Seeid., at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 1\u20133). The role of\nthe Ku Klux Klan was highlighted. Seeibid.; see alsoid., at ___ (Sotomayor, J., concurring in part) (slip op.,\nat 4);id., at ___ (Kavanaugh, J., concurring in part) (slip\nop., at 12).I argued in dissent that this original\nmotivation, though deplorable, had no bearing on the laws\u2019\nconstitutionality because such laws can be adopted for\nnon-discriminatory reasons, and \u201cboth States readopted their rules\nunder different circumstances in later years.\u201dId., at ___\n(slip op., at 3). But I lost, andRamosis now precedent. If\nthe original motivation for the laws mattered there, it certainly\nmatters here.The origin of Montana\u2019s \u201cno-aid\u201d provision,\nMont.

Named after House Speaker\nJames Blaine, the Congressman who introduced it in 1875, the\namendment was prompted by virulent prejudice against immigrants,\nparticularly Catholic immigrants. In effect, the amendment would\nhave \u201cbar[red] any aid\u201d to Catholic and other \u201csectarian\u201d schools.Mitchellv.Helms,530 U.S.\n793, 828 (2000) (plurality opinion). As noted in a publication\nfrom the United States Commission on Civil Rights, a prominent\nsupporter of this ban was the Ku Klux Klan.[1]The Blaine Amendment was narrowly defeated,\npassing in the House but falling just short of the two-thirds\nmajority needed in the Senate to refer the amendment to the States.\nSee 4 Cong. Rec. 5191\u20135192 (1876) (House vote);id., at 5595\n(28 yeas, 16 nays in the Senate). Afterwards, most States adopted\nprovisions like Montana\u2019s to achieve the same objective at the\nstate level, often as a condition of entering the Union.\nThirty-eight States still have these \u201clittle Blaine Amendments\u201d\ntoday. See App. D to Brief for Respondents.This history is well-known and has been\nrecognized in opinions of this Court. See,e.g.,Lockev.Davey,540 U.S.\n712, 723, n.\u00a07 (2004);Mitchell, 530 U.\u00a0S., at\n828\u2013829 (plurality opinion); see alsoante, at 15\u201316;Zelmanv.Simmons- Harris,536\nU.S. 639, 720\u2013721 (2002) (Breyer, J., dissenting). But given\nrespondents\u2019 and one dissent\u2019s efforts to downplay it in\ncontravention ofRamos, see Brief for Respondents 16\u201323;post, at 4\u20135, n.\u00a02 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting), it\ndeserves a brief retelling.A wave of immigration in the mid-19th century,\nspurred in part by potato blights in Ireland and Germany,\nsignificantly increased this country\u2019s Catholic\npopulation.[2] Nativist fears\nincreased with it. An entire political party, the Know Nothings,\nformed in the 1850s \u201cto decrease the political influence of\nimmigrants and Catholics,\u201d gaining hundreds of seats in Federal and\nState Government.[3]Catholics were considered by such groups not as\ncitizens of the United States, but as \u201csoldiers of the Church of\nRome,\u201d[4] who \u201cwould attempt to\nsubvert representative government.\u201d[5] Catholic education was a particular concern. As one\nseries of newspaper articles argued, \u201c\u00a0\u2018Popery is the natural\nenemy ofgeneraleducation.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. If it is\nestablishing schools, it is to make themprisonsof the\nyouthful intellect of the country.\u2019\u00a0\u201d C. Glenn, The Myth of\nthe Common School 69 (1988) (Glenn) (quoting S. Morse, Foreign\nConspiracy Against the Liberties of the United States (1835)). With\na Catholic school breaking ground in New York City, the New York\nTimes ran an article titled \u201cSectarian Education. Anti-Public\nSchool Crusade. Aggressive Attitude of the Roman Catholic\nClergy\u2014The Terrors of the Church Threatened.\u201d N.\u00a0Y. Times,\nAug. 24, 1873, p. 8. The project, the article concluded, would\ncause \u201cintense anxiety by all who are interested in upholding the\nadmirable system of public school education.\u201dIbid.The feelings of the day are perhaps best\nencapsulated by this famous cartoon, published in Harper\u2019s Weekly\nin 1871, which depicts Catholic priests as crocodiles slithering\nhungrily toward American children as a public school crumbles in\nthe background:The resulting wave of state laws withholding\npublic aid from \u201csectarian\u201d schools cannot be understood outside\nthis context. Indeed, there are stronger reasons for considering\noriginal motivations here than inRamosbecause, unlike the\nneutral language of Louisiana\u2019s and Oregon\u2019s non- unanimity rules,\nMontana\u2019s no-aid provision retains the bigoted code language used\nthroughout state Blaine Amendments.The failed Blaine Amendment would have\nprohibited any public funds or lands devoted to schooling from\n\u201cever be[ing] under the control of any religious sect.\u201d 4 Cong.\nRec. 205 (1875). As originally adopted, Montana\u2019s Constitution\nprohibited the state and local governments from \u201cever mak[ing,]\ndirectly or indirectly, any appropriation\u201d for \u201cany sectarian\npurpose\u201d or \u201cto aid in the support of any school .\u00a0.\u00a0.\ncontrolled in whole or in part by any church, sect or denomination\nwhatever.\u201d Mont. Const., Art. XI, \u00a78 (1889). At the time, \u201cit was\nan open secret that \u2018sectarian\u2019 was code for \u2018Catholic.\u2019\u00a0\u201dMitchell, 530 U.\u00a0S., at 828 (plurality opinion).\nDictionaries defined a \u201csectarian\u201d as a member \u201cof a party in\nreligion which has separated itself from the established church, or\nwhich holds tenets different from those of the prevailing\ndenomination in a kingdom or state\u201d\u2014a heretic. N. Webster, An\nAmerican Dictionary of the English Language (1828); see also\nIndependence Institute Brief 9\u201316 (collecting several similar\ndefinitions). Newspapers throughout the country, including in\nMontana, used the word in similarly pejorative fashion. Seeid.,at 17\u201326 (collecting several articles). The term was\nlikewise used against Mormons and Jews.[6]Backers of the Blaine Amendment either held\nnativist views or capitalized on them. When Blaine introduced the\namendment, The Nation reported that it was \u201ca Constitutional\namendment directed against the Catholics\u201d\u2014while surmising that\nBlaine, whose Presidential ambitions were known, sought \u201cto use it\nin the campaign to catch anti- Catholic votes.\u201d[7] The amendment had its intended galvanizing\neffect. \u201cIts popularity was so great\u201d that \u201ceven congressional\nDemocrats,\u201d who depended on Catholic votes, \u201cwere expected to\nsupport it,\u201d and the congressional floor debates were rife with\nanti-Catholic sentiment, including \u201ca tirade against Pope Pius\nIX.\u201d[8]Montana\u2019s no-aid provision was the result of\nthis same prejudice. When Congress allowed Montana into the Union\nin 1889, it still included prominent supporters of the failed\nBlaine Amendment. See Sen. Daines Brief 10\u201313. The Act enabling\nMontana to become a State required \u201c[t]hat provision shall be made\nfor the establishment and maintenance of systems of public schools\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. free from sectarian control.\u201d Act of Feb. 22, 1889,\n\u00a74, 25Stat. 677; see also Becket Fund Brief 17\u201318 (quoting one\nSenator\u2019s description of the Act as \u201c\u00a0\u2018completing the\nunfinished work of the failed Blaine Amendment\u2019\u00a0\u201d). Montana\nthereafter adopted its constitutional rule against public funding\nfor any school \u201ccontrolled\u201d by a \u201csect.\u201d Mont. Const., Art. XI, \u00a78\n(1889). There appears to have been no doubt which schools that\nmeant. As petitioners show, Montana\u2019s religious schools\u2014and its\nprivate schools in general\u2014were predominantly Catholic, see Brief\nfor Petitioners 42, and n. 41, and anti-Catholicism was alive in\nMontana too. See,e.g., Sen. Daines Brief 1\u20133 (describing a\nriot over an anti-Catholic sign hung over a Butte saloon on\nIndependence Day, 1894).Respondents argue that Montana\u2019s no-aid\nprovision merely reflects a state interest in \u201cpreserv[ing] funding\nfor public schools,\u201d Brief for Respondents 7, known as \u201ccommon\nschools\u201d during the Blaine era. Yet just as one cannot separate the\nBlaine Amendment from its context, \u201c[o]ne cannot separate the\nfounding of the American common school and the strong nativist\nmovement.\u201d[9]Spearheaded by Horace Mann, Secretary of the\nMassachusetts Board of Education from 1837 to 1848, the\ncommon-school movement did not aim to establish a system that was\nscrupulously neutral on matters of religion. (In a country like\nours, that would have been exceedingly difficult, if not\nimpossible.) Instead the aim was to establish a system that would\ninculcate a form of \u201cleast-common- denominator\nProtestantism.\u201d[10] This was\naccomplished withdaily reading from the King James Bible, a\ncurriculum that, Mann said, let the book \u201cspeak for itself.\u201d\n4\u00a0Life and Works of Horace Mann 312 (1891) (Mann\u2019s 12th annual\nreport on the Massachusetts schools; emphasis deleted). Yet it was\nan affront to many Christians and especially Catholics, not to\nmention non-Christians.[11]Mann\u2019s goal was to \u201cAmericanize\u201d the incoming\nCatholic immigrants. In fact, he and other proponents of the\ncommon-school movement used language and made insinuations that\ntoday would be considered far more inflammatory. In his 10th annual\nreport on the Massachusetts schools, Mann described the State as\n\u201cparental,\u201d assuming the responsibility of weaning children\n\u201c[f\u00a0]or the support of the poor, nine-tenths of whose cost\noriginate with foreigners or come from one prolific vice,\u201d meaning\nalcohol. 4 Life and Works of Horace Mann, at 132, 134 (emphasis\ndeleted). In other writing, he described the common-school movement\nas \u201c\u00a0\u2018laboring to elevate mankind into the upper and purer\nregions of civilization, Christianity, and the worship of the true\nGod; all those who are obstructing the progress of this cause are\nimpelling the race backwards into barbarism and idolatry.\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nGlenn 171\u2013172 (quoting an 1846 article by Mann in the Common School\nJournal).These \u201cobstructers\u201d were Catholic and other\nreligious groups and families who objected to the common schools\u2019\nreligious programming, which, as just seen, was not neutral on\nmatters of religion. Objections met violent response. In\nMassachusetts and elsewhere, Catholic students were beaten and\nexpelled for refusing to read from the King James Bible.[12] In New York, a mob destroyed the\nresidence of Bishop John Hughes, who had argued that, if the\nStatewas going to fund religious public education, it\nshould also support church schools. The militia needed to be called\nto protect St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral.[13] Most notorious were the Philadelphia Bible Riots. In\n1844, a rumor circulated in the city\u2019s nativist newspapers that a\nschool director, who was Catholic, had ordered that Bible reading\nbe stopped.[14] Months of\nscaremongering broke out into riots that left two of the city\u2019s\nCatholic churches burned and several people dead. Only by calling\nout the militia and positioning a cannon in front of a Catholic\nchurch\u2014which itself had been taking cannon fire\u2014were the riots\nultimately quelled.[15]Catholic and Jewish schools sprang up because\nthe common schools were not neutral on matters of religion. \u201cFaced\nwith public schools that were culturally Protestant and with\ncurriculum[s] and textbooks that were, consequently, rife with\nmaterial that Catholics and Jews found offensive, many Catholics\nand Orthodox Jews created separate schools,\u201d and those \u201cwho could\nafford to do so sent their children to\u201d those schools.[16]But schools require significant funding, and\nwhen religious organizations requested state assistance, Mann and\nothers labeled them \u201csectarian\u201d\u2014that is, people who had separated\nfrom the prevailing orthodoxy. See,e.g., Jeffries &\nRyan 298, 301. The Blaine movement quickly followed.In 1854, the Know Nothing party, in many ways a\nforerunner of the Ku Klux Klan,[17] took control of the legislature in Mann\u2019s State of\nMassachusetts and championed one of the first constitutional bans\non aid to \u201csectarian\u201d schools (along with attempting to limit the\nfranchise to native-born people). See Viteritti, Blaine\u2019s Wake\n669\u2013670.Respondents and one dissent argue that Montana\u2019s\nno-aid provision was cleansed of its bigoted past because it was\nreadopted for non-bigoted reasons in Montana\u2019s 1972 constitutional\nconvention. Seepost, at 4\u20135, n.\u00a02 (opinion of\nSotomayor, J.); see also Brief for Respondents 18; Tr. of Oral Arg.\n22\u201323. They emphasize that the convention included Catholics, just\nas the constitutional convention that readopted Louisiana\u2019s\npurportedly racist non-unanimous jury provision included black\ndelegates. As noted, a virtually identical argument was rejected inRamos, even though \u201c\u00a0\u2018no mention was made of\nrace\u2019\u00a0\u201d during the Louisiana convention debates. 590\nU.\u00a0S., at ___ (Alito, J., dissenting) (slip\u00a0op., at 3)\n(quotingStatev.Hankton, 2012\u20130375, p.\u00a019 (La.\nApp. 4 Cir. 8/2/13), 122 So. 3d 1028, 1038). UnderRamos, it\nemphatically does not matter whether Montana readopted the no-aid\nprovision for benign reasons. The provision\u2019s \u201cuncomfortable past\u201d\nmust still be \u201c[e]xamined.\u201d 590 U.\u00a0S., at ___, n.\u00a044\n(opinion of the Court) (slip op., at 14, n.\u00a044). And here, it\nis not so clear that the animus was scrubbed.Delegates at Montana\u2019s constitutional convention\nin 1972 acknowledged that the no-aid provision was \u201ca badge of\nbigotry,\u201d with one Catholic delegate recalling \u201cbeing let out of\nschool in the fourth grade to erase three \u2018Ks\u2019 on the front doors\nof the Catholic church in Billings.\u201d[18] Nevertheless the convention proposed, and the State\nadopted, a provision with thesamematerial language,\nprohibiting public aid \u201cfor anysectarianpurpose or to aid\nany .\u00a0.\u00a0. school .\u00a0.\u00a0. controlled in whole or\nin part by any church,sect, or denomination.\u201d Mont. Const.,\nArt.\u00a0X, \u00a76(1) (1972) (emphasis added). A leading definition of\n\u201csect\u201d at the time, as during the Blaine era, was \u201ca dissenting\nreligious body;esp: one that is heretical in the eyes of other\nmembers within the same communion.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New\nInternational Dictionary 2052 (1971) (emphasis added).Given the history above, the terms \u201csect\u201d and\n\u201csectarian\u201d are disquieting remnants. And once again, there appears\nto have been little doubt which schools this provision would\npredominantly affect. In 1970, according to the National Center for\nEducational Statistics, Montana had 61 religiously affiliated\nschools. Forty-five were Roman Catholic.[19] Not only did the convention delegates acknowledge\nthe no-aid provision\u2019s original anti-Catholic intent, but the\nMontana Supreme Court had only ever applied the provision once\u2014to a\nCatholic school, and one that had \u201ccarrie[d] a sizeable portion of\nthe total educational load\u201d in Anaconda, Montana.State\nex\u00a0rel. Chambersv.School Dist. No. 10 of Deer Lodge\nCty., 155 Mont. 422, 430,472 P.2d 1013, 1017 (1970) (per\u00a0curiam). The\nMontana Catholic Conference also voiced concerns about access to\nschool funds, and a convention delegate proposed removing the\nno-aid provision\u2019s restriction on \u201cindirect\u201d aid. See Convention\nTr. 2010, 2027. That amendment was rejected.Thus, the no-aid provision\u2019s terms keep it\n\u201c[t]ethered\u201d to its original \u201cbias,\u201d and it is not clear at all\nthat the State \u201cactually confront[ed]\u201d the provision\u2019s \u201ctawdry past\nin reenacting it.\u201dRamos, 590 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (Sotomayor,\nJ., concurring in part) (slip op., at 4). After all, whereas the\nno-aid provision had originally been foisted on Montana, the State\nreadopted it voluntarily\u2014\u201csectarian\u201d references included. Whether\nor not the State did so for any reason that could be called\nlegitimate, the convention delegates recognized that the provision\nwould \u201ccontinue to mean and do whatever it does now,\u201d Convention\nTr. 2014 (statement of Delegate Loendorf\u00a0), and the\ndiscrimination in this case shows that the provision continues to\nhave its originally intended effect. And even if Montana had done\nmore to address its no-aid provision\u2019s past, that would of course\ndo nothing to resolve the bias inherent in the Blaine Amendments\namong the 17 States, by respondents\u2019 count, that have not readopted\nor amended them since around the turn of the 20th century.[20]Today\u2019s public schools are quite different from\nthose envisioned by Horace Mann, but many parents of many different\nfaiths still believe that their local schools inculcate a worldview\nthat is antithetical to what they teach at home. Many have turned\nto religious schools, at considerable expense, or have undertaken\nthe burden of homeschooling. The tax-credit program adopted by the\nMontana Legislature but overturned by the Montana Supreme Court\nprovided necessary aid for parents who pay taxes to support the\npublic schools but who disagree with the teaching there. The\nprogram helped parents of modest means do what more affluent\nparents can do: send their children to a school of their choice.\nThe argument that the decision below treats everyone the same is\nreminiscent of Anatole France\u2019s sardonic remark that \u201c\u00a0\u2018[t]he\nlaw, in its majestic equality, forbids the rich as well as the poor\nto sleep under bridges, to beg in the streets, and to steal\nbread.\u2019\u00a0\u201d J.
