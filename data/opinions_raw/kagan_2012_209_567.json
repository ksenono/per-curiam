SALAZAR, SECRETARY OF THE\nINTERIOR, et\u00a0al., PETITIONERS11\u2013247v.DAVID PATCHAK et\u00a0al.on writs of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the district of columbia circuit[June 18, 2012]Justice Kagan delivered the opinion of the\nCourt.A provision of the Indian Reorganization Act\n(IRA), 25 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7465, authorizes the Secretary of the\nInterior (Secretary) to acquire property \u201cfor the purpose of\nproviding land for Indians.\u201d Ch. 576, \u00a75, 48Stat. 985. The\nSecretary here acquired land in trust for an Indian tribe seeking\nto open a casino. Respondent David Patchak lives near that land and\nchallenges the Secretary\u2019s decision in a suit brought under the\nAdministrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7701et\u00a0seq. Patchak claims that the Secretary lacked\nauthority under \u00a7465 to take title to the land, and alleges\neconomic, environmental, and aesthetic harms from the casino\u2019s\noperation.We consider two questions arising from Patchak\u2019s\naction. The first is whether the United States has sovereign\nimmunity from the suit by virtue of the Quiet Title Act (QTA),\n86Stat. 1176. We think it does not. The second is whether Patchak\nhas prudential standing to challenge the Secretary\u2019s acquisition.\nWe think he does. We therefore hold that Patchak\u2019s suit may\nproceed.IThe Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi\nIndians (Band) is an Indian tribe residing in rural Michigan.\nAlthough the Band has a long history, the Department of the\nInterior (DOI) formally recognized it only in 1999. See 63 Fed.\nReg. 56936 (1998). Two years later, the Band petitioned the\nSecretary to exercise her authority under \u00a7465 by taking into trust\na tract of land in Wayland Township, Michigan, known as the Bradley\nProperty. The Band\u2019s application explained that the Band would use\nthe property \u201cfor gaming purposes,\u201d with the goal of generating the\n\u201crevenue necessary to promote tribal economic development,\nself-sufficiency and a strong tribal government capable of\nproviding its members with sorely needed social and educational\nprograms.\u201d App. 52, 41.[1]In 2005, after a lengthy administrative review,\nthe Secretary announced her decision to acquire the Bradley\nProperty in trust for the Band. See 70 Fed. Reg. 25596. In\naccordance with applicable regulations, the Secretary committed to\nwait 30 days before taking action, so that interested parties could\nseek judicial review. Seeibid.; 25 CFR \u00a7151.12(b) (2011).\nWithin that window, an organization called Michigan Gambling\nOpposition (or MichGO) filed suit alleging that the Secretary\u2019s\ndecision violated environmental and gaming statutes. The Secretary\nheld off taking title to the property while that litigation\nproceeded. Within the next few years, a District Court and the\nD.\u00a0C. Circuit rejected MichGO\u2019s claims. SeeMichigan\nGambling Oppositionv.Kempthorne, 525 F.3d 23, 27\u201328\n(CADC 2008);Michigan Gambling Oppositionv.Norton,\n477 F. Supp. 2d 1 (DC 2007).Shortly after the D.\u00a0C. Circuit ruled\nagainst MichGO (but still before the Secretary took title), Patchak\nfiled this suit under the APA advancing a different legal theory.\nHe asserted that \u00a7465 did not authorize the Secretary to acquire\nproperty for the Band because it was not a feder- ally recognized\ntribe when the IRA was enacted in 1934. See App. 37. To establish\nhis standing to bring suit, Patchak contended that he lived \u201cin\nclose proximity to\u201d the Bradley Property and that a casino there\nwould \u201cdestroy the lifestyle he has enjoyed\u201d by causing \u201cincreased\ntraffic,\u201d \u201cincreased crime,\u201d \u201cdecreased property values,\u201d \u201can\nirreversible change in the rural character of the area,\u201d and \u201cother\naesthetic, socioeconomic, and environmental problems.\u201dId.,at 30\u201331. Notably, Patchak did not assert any claim of his own to\nthe Bradley Property. He requested only a declaration that the\ndecision to acquire the land violated the IRA and an injunction to\nstop the Secretary from accepting title. Seeid.,at 38\u201339.\nThe Band intervened in the suit to defend the Secretary\u2019s\ndecision.In January 2009, about five months after Patchak\nfiled suit, this Court denied certiorari in MichGO\u2019s case, 555 U.S.\n1137, and the Secretary took the Bradley Property into trust. That\naction mooted Patchak\u2019s request for an injunction to prevent the\nacquisition, and all parties agree that the suit now effectively\nseeks to divest the Federal Government of title to the land. See\nBrief for Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians 17\n(hereinafter Tribal Petitioner); Brief for Federal Petitioners 11;\nBrief for Respondent 24\u201325. The month after the Government took\ntitle, this Court held inCarcieriv.Salazar,555 U.S.\n379, 382 (2009), that \u00a7465 authorizes the Secretary to take\nland into trust only for tribes that were \u201cunder federal\njurisdiction\u201d in 1934.[2]The District Court dismissed the suit without\nconsidering the merits (including the relevance ofCarcieri), ruling that Patchak lacked prudential standing to\nchallenge the Secretary\u2019s acquisition of the Bradley Property. The\ncourt reasoned that the injuries Patchak alleged fell outside\n\u00a7465\u2019s \u201czone of interests.\u201d 646 F. Supp. 2d 72, 76 (DC 2009). The\nD.\u00a0C. Circuit reversed that determination. See 632 F.3d 702,\n704\u2013707 (2011). The court also rejected the Secretary\u2019s and the\nBand\u2019s alternative argument that by virtue of the QTA, sovereign\nimmunity barred the suit. Seeid.,at 707\u2013712. The latter\nruling conflicted with decisions of three Circuits holding that the\nUnited States has immunity from suits like Patchak\u2019s. SeeNeighbors for Rational Development, Inc.v.Norton,379 F.3d 956, 961\u2013962 (CA10 2004);Metropolitan Water Dist.\nof Southern\u00a0Cal.v.United States,830 F.2d 139,\n143\u2013144 (CA9 1987)(per\u00a0curiam);Florida Dept. of\nBus. Regulationv.Department of Interior, 768 F.2d\n1248, 1253\u20131255 (CA11 1985). We granted certiorari to review both\nof the D.\u00a0C. Circuit\u2019s holdings, 565 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2011),\nand we now affirm.IIWe begin by considering whether the United\nStates\u2019 sovereign immunity bars Patchak\u2019s suit under the APA. That\nrequires us first to look to the APA itself and then, for reasons\nwe will describe, to the QTA. We conclude that the United States\nhas waived its sovereign immunity from Patchak\u2019s action.The APA generally waives the Federal\nGovernment\u2019s immunity from a suit \u201cseeking relief other than money\ndamages and stating a claim that an agency or an officer or\nemployee thereof acted or failed to act in an official capacity or\nunder color of legal authority.\u201d 5 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7702. That\nwaiver would appear to cover Patchak\u2019s suit, which objects to\nofficial action of the Secretary and seeks only non-monetary\nrelief. But the APA\u2019s waiver of immunity comes with an important\ncarve-out: The waiver does not apply \u201cif any other statute that\ngrants consent to suit expressly or impliedly forbids the relief\nwhich is sought\u201d by the plaintiff.Ibid.That provision\nprevents plaintiffs from exploiting the APA\u2019s waiver to evade\nlimitations on suit contained in other statutes. The question thus\nbecomes whether another statute bars Patchak\u2019s demand for\nrelief.The Government and Band contend that the QTA\ndoes so. The QTA authorizes (and so waives the Government\u2019s\nsovereign immunity from) a particular type of action, known as a\nquiet title suit: a suit by a plaintiff asserting a \u201cright, title,\nor interest\u201d in real property that conflicts with a \u201cright, title,\nor interest\u201d the United States claims. 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a72409a(d). The statute, however, contains an exception: The QTA\u2019s\nauthorization of suit \u201cdoes not apply to trust or restricted Indian\nlands.\u201d \u00a72409a(a). According to the Government and Band, that\nlimitation on quiet title suits satisfies the APA\u2019s carve-out and\nso forbids Patchak\u2019s suit. In the Band\u2019s words, the QTA exception\nretains \u201cthe United States\u2019 full immunity from suits seeking to\nchallenge its title to or impair its legal interest in Indian trust\nlands.\u201d Brief for Tribal Petitioner 18.Two hypothetical examples might help to frame\nconsideration of this argument. First, suppose Patchak had sued\nunder the APA claiming thatheowned the Bradley Property\nand that the Secretary therefore could not take it into trust. The\nQTA would bar that suit, for reasons just suggested. True, it fits\nwithin the APA\u2019s general waiver, but the QTA specifically\nauthorizes quiet title actions (which this hypothetical suit is)exceptwhenthey involve Indian lands (which this\nhypothetical suit does). In such a circumstance, a plaintiff cannot\nuse the APA to end-run the QTA\u2019s limitations. \u201c[W]hen Congress has\ndealt in par- ticularity with a claim and [has] intended a\nspecified remedy\u201d\u2014including its exceptions\u2014to be exclusive, that is\nthe end of the matter; the APA does not undo the judgment.Blockv.North Dakota ex rel. Board of Univ. and School\nLands,461\nU.S. 273, 286, n. 22 (1983) (quoting H.\u00a0R. Rep. No.\n94\u20131656, p.\u00a013 (1976)).But now suppose that Patchak had sued under the\nAPA claiming only that use of the Bradley Property was causing\nenvironmental harm, and raising no objection at all to the\nSecretary\u2019s title. The QTA could not bar that suit because even\nthough involving Indian lands, it asserts a grievance altogether\ndifferent from the kind the statute concerns. Justice Scalia, in a\nformer life as Assistant Attorney General, made this precise point\nin a letter to Congress about the APA\u2019s waiver of immunity (which\nwe hasten to add, given the author, we use not as legislative\nhistory, but only for its persuasive force). When a statute \u201cis not\naddressed to the type of grievance which the plaintiff seeks to\nassert,\u201d then the statute cannot prevent an APA suit.Id.,at 28 (May 10, 1976, letter of Assistant Atty. Gen. A.\nScalia).[3]We think that principle controls Patchak\u2019s case:\nThe QTA\u2019s \u201cIndian lands\u201d clause does not render the Government\nimmune because the QTA addresses a kind of grievance different from\nthe one Patchak advances. As we will explain, the QTA\u2014whose full\nname, recall, is the Quiet Title Act\u2014concerns (no great surprise)\nquiet title actions. And Patchak\u2019s suit isnota quiet title\naction, because although it contests the Secretary\u2019s title, it does\nnot claim any competing interest in the Bradley Property. That fact\nmakes the QTA\u2019s \u201cIndian lands\u201d limitation simply inapposite to this\nlitigation.In reaching this conclusion, we need look no\nfurther than the QTA\u2019s text. From its title to its jurisdictional\ngrant to its venue provision, the Act speaks specifically and\nrepeatedly of \u201cquiet title\u201d actions. See 86Stat. 1176 (\u201cAn Act [t]o\npermit suits to adjudicate certain real property quiet title\nactions\u201d); 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71346(f) (giving district courts\njurisdiction over \u201ccivil actions .\u00a0.\u00a0. to quiet title\u201d to\nproperty in which the United States claims an interest); \u00a71402(d)\n(setting forth venue for \u201c[a]ny civil action .\u00a0.\u00a0. to\nquiet title\u201d to property in which the United States claims an\ninterest). That term is universally understood to refer to suits in\nwhich a plaintiff not only challenges someone else\u2019s claim, but\nalso asserts his own right to disputed property. See,e.g.,Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 34 (9th ed. 2009) (defining an \u201caction to\nquiet title\u201d as \u201c[a] proceeding to establish a plaintiff\u2019s\ntitle to land by compelling the adverse claimant to establish a\nclaim or be forever estopped from asserting it\u201d);Grable &\nSons Metal Products, Inc.v.Darue Engineering &\nMfg.,545 U.S.\n308, 315 (2005) (\u201c[T]he facts showing the plaintiffs\u2019 title\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. are essential parts of the plaintiffs\u2019 [quiet\ntitle] cause of action\u201d (quotingHopkinsv.Walker,244 U.S.\n486, 490 (1917))).And the QTA\u2019s other provisions make clear that\nthe recurrent statutory term \u201cquiet title action\u201d carries its or-\ndinary meaning. The QTA directs that the complaint in such an\naction \u201cshall set forth with particularity the nature of the right,\ntitle, or interest which the plaintiff claims in the real\nproperty.\u201d 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72409a(d). If the plaintiff does\nnot assert any such right (as Patchak does not), the statute cannot\ncome into play.[4] Further, the\nQTA provides an option for the United States, if it loses the suit,\nto pay \u201cjust compensation,\u201d rather than return the property, to the\n\u201cperson determined to be entitled\u201d to it. \u00a72409a(b). That provision\nmakes perfect sense in a quiet title action: If the plaintiff is\nfound to own the property, the Government can satisfy his claim\nthrough an award of money (while still retaining the land for its\noperations). But the provision makes no sense in a suit like this\none, where Patchak does not assert a right to the property. If the\nUnited States loses the suit, an award of just compensation to the\nrightful owner (whoever and wherever he might be) could do nothing\nto satisfy Patchak\u2019s claim.[5]In two prior cases, we likewise described the\nQTA as addressing suits in which the plaintiff asserts an ownership\ninterest in Government-held property. InBlockv.North\nDakota ex\u00a0rel. Board of Univ. and School Lands,461 U.S.\n273(1982), we considered North Dakota\u2019s claim to land that the\nUnited States viewed as its own. We held that the State could not\ncircumvent the QTA\u2019s statute of limitations by invoking other\ncauses of action, among them the APA. Seeid.,at 277\u2013278,\n286, n. 22. The crux of our reasoning was that Congress had enacted\nthe QTA to address exactly the kind of suit North Dakota had\nbrought. Prior to the QTA, we explained, \u201ccitizens asserting title\nto or the right to possession of lands claimed by the United\nStates\u201d had no recourse; by passing the statute, \u201cCongress sought\nto rectify this state of affairs.\u201dId.,at 282. Our decision\nreflected that legislative purpose: Congress, we held, \u201cintended\nthe QTA to provide the exclusive means by which adverse claimants\ncould challenge the United States\u2019 title to real property.\u201dId.,at 286. We repeat: \u201cadverse claimants,\u201d meaning\nplaintiffs who themselves assert a claim to property antagonistic\nto the Federal Government\u2019s.Our decision inUnited Statesv.Mottaz,476 U.S.\n834(1986), is of a piece. There, we considered whether the\nQTA, or instead the Tucker Act or General Allotment Act, governed\nthe plaintiff\u2019s suit respecting certain allotments of land held by\nthe United States. We thought the QTA the relevant statute because\nthe plaintiff herself asserted title to the property. Our opinion\nquoted the plaintiff\u2019s own description of her suit: \u201cAt no time in\nthis proceeding did [the plaintiff] drop her claim for title. To\nthe contrary, the claim for title is the essence and bottom line of\n[the plaintiff\u2019s] case.\u201dId.,at 842 (quoting Brief for\nRespondent inMottaz, O. T. 1985, No. 546, p.\u00a03). That\nfact, we held, brought the suit \u201cwithin the [QTA\u2019s] scope\u201d: \u201cWhat\n[the plaintiff] seeks is a declaration that she alone possesses\nvalid title.\u201d 476 U.\u00a0S., at 842. So once again, we construed\nthe QTA as addressing suits by adverse claimants.But Patchak is not an adverse claimant\u2014and so\nthe QTA (more specifically, its reservation of sovereign immunity\nfrom actions respecting Indian trust lands) cannot bar his suit.\nPatchak does not contend that he owns the Bradley Property, nor\ndoes he seek any relief corresponding to such a claim. He wants a\ncourt to strip the United States of title to the land, but not on\nthe ground that it is his and not so that he can possess it.\nPatchak\u2019s lawsuit therefore lacks a defining feature of a QTA\naction. He is not trying to disguise a QTA suit as an APA action to\ncircumvent the QTA\u2019s \u201cIndian lands\u201d exception. Rather, he is not\nbringing a QTA suit at all. He asserts merely that the Secretary\u2019s\ndecision to take land into trust violates a federal statute\u2014a\ngarden-variety APA claim. See 5 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a7706(2)(A), (C)\n(\u201cThe reviewing court shall .\u00a0.\u00a0. hold unlawful and set\naside agency action .\u00a0.\u00a0. not in accordance with law [or]\nin excess of statutory jurisdiction [or] authority\u201d). Because that\nis true\u2014because in then-Assistant Attorney General Scalia\u2019s words,\nthe QTA is \u201cnot addressed to the type of grievance which [Patchak]\nseeks to assert,\u201d H.\u00a0R. Rep. 94\u20131656, at\u00a028\u2014the QTA\u2019s\nlimitation of remedies has no bearing. The APA\u2019s general waiver of\nsovereign immunity instead applies.The Band and Government, along with the dissent,\nobject to this conclusion on three basic grounds. First, they\ncontend that the QTA speaks more broadly than we have indicated,\nwaiving immunity from suits \u201cto adjudicate a disputed title to real\nproperty in which the United States claims an interest.\u201d 28\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72409a(a). That language, the argument goes,\nencompasses all actions contesting the Government\u2019s legal interest\nin land, regardless whether the plaintiff claims ownership himself.\nSee Brief for Federal Petitioners 19\u201320; Reply Brief for Tribal\nPetitioner 4\u20136;post, at 8\u20139 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting).\nThe QTA (not the APA) thus becomes the relevant statute after\nall\u2014as to both its waiver and its \u201ccorresponding\u201d reservation of\nimmunity from suits involving Indian lands. Reply Brief for Tribal\nPetitioner 6.But the Band and Government can reach that\nresult only by neglecting key words in the relevant provision. That\nsentence, more fully quoted, reads: \u201cThe United States may be named\nas a party defendant ina civil actionunder this\nsectionto adjudicate a disputed title to real property in\nwhich the United States claims an interest.\u201d \u00a72409a(a) (emphasis\nadded). And as we have already noted, \u201cthis\nsection\u201d\u2014\u00a72409a\u2014includes a host of indications that the \u201ccivil\naction\u201d at issue is an ordinary quiet title suit: Just recall the\nsection\u2019s title (\u201cReal property quiet title actions\u201d), and its\npleading requirements (the plaintiff \u201cshall set forth with\nparticularity the nature of the right, title, or interest which\n[he] claims\u201d), and its permission to the Government to remedy an\ninfraction by paying \u201cjust compensation.\u201d Read with reference to\nall these provisions (as well as to the QTA\u2019s contemporane ously\nenacted jurisdictional and venue sections), the waiver clause\nrebuts, rather than supports, the Band\u2019s and the Government\u2019s\nargument: That clause speaks not to any suit in which a plaintiff\nchallenges the Government\u2019s title, but only to an action in which\nthe plaintiff also claims an interest in the property.The Band and Government next invoke cases\nholding that \u201cwhen a statute provides a detailed mechanism for\njudicial consideration of particular issues at the behest of\nparticular persons,\u201d the statute may \u201cimpliedly preclude[\u00a0]\u201d\njudicial review \u201cof those issues at the behest of other persons.\u201dBlockv.Community Nutrition Institute,467 U.S.\n340, 349 (1984); seeUnited Statesv.Fausto,484 U.S.\n439, 455 (1988). Here, the Band and Government contend, the\nQTA\u2019s specific authorization of adverse claimants\u2019 suits creates a\nnegative implication:non-adverse claimants like Patchak\ncannot challenge Government ownership of land under any other\nstatute. See Reply Brief for Tribal Petitoner 7\u201310; Reply Brief for\nFederal Petitioners 7\u20139; see alsopost, at 3\u20134. The QTA,\nsays the Band, thus \u201cpreempts [Patchak\u2019s] more general remedies.\u201d\nBrief for Tribal Petitioner 23 (internal quotation marks\nomitted).But we think that argument faulty, and the cited\ncases inapposite, for the reason already given: Patchak is bringing\na different claim, seeking different relief, from the kind the QTA\naddresses. Seesupra,at 7\u201310. To see the point, consider a\ncontrasting example. Suppose the QTA authorized suit only by\nadverse claimants who could assert a property interest of at least\na decade\u2019s duration. Then suppose an adverse claimant failing to\nmeet that requirement (because, say, his claim to title went back\nonly five years) brought suit under a general statute like the APA.\nWe would surely bar that suit, citing the cases the Government and\nBand rely on; in our imaginary statute, Congress delineated the\nclass of persons who could bring a quiet title suit, and that\njudgment would preclude others from doing so. But here, once again,\nPatchak is not bringing a quiet title action at all. He is not\nclaiming to own the property, and he is not demanding that the\ncourt transfer the property to him. So to succeed in their\nargument, the Government and Band must go much further than the\ncited cases: They must say that in authorizing one person to bring\none kind of suit seeking one form of relief, Congress barred\nanother person from bringing another kind of suit seeking another\nform of relief. Presumably, that contention would extend only to\nsuits involving similar subject matter\u2014i.e.,the\nGovernment\u2019s ownership of property. But that commonality is not\nitself sufficient. We have never held, and see no cause to hold\nhere, that some general similarity of subject matter can alone\ntrigger a remedial statute\u2019s preclusive effect.Last, the Band and Government argue that we\nshould treat Patchak\u2019s suit as we would an adverse claimant\u2019s\nbecause they equally implicate the \u201cIndian lands\u201d exception\u2019s\npolicies. According to the Government, allowing challenges to the\nSecretary\u2019s trust acquisitions would \u201cpose significant barriers to\ntribes[\u2019] .\u00a0.\u00a0. ability to promote investment and\neconomic development on the lands.\u201d Brief for Federal Petitioners\n24. That harm is the same whether or not a plaintiff claims to own\nthe land himself. Indeed, the Band argues that the sole difference\nin this suit cuts in its direction, because non-adverse claimants\nlike Patchak have \u201cthe most remote injuries and indirect interests\nin the land.\u201d Brief for Tribal Petitioner 13; see Reply Brief for\nFederal Petitioners 11\u201312; see alsopost, at 2, 7,\n10.[6]That argument is not without force, but it must\nbe addressed to Congress. In the QTA, Congress made a judgment\nabout how far to allow quiet title suits\u2014to a point, but no\nfurther. (The \u201cno further\u201d includes not only the \u201cIndian lands\u201d\nexception, but one for security interests and water rights, as well\nas a statute of limitations, a bar on jury trials, jurisdictional\nand venue constraints, and the just compensation option discussed\nearlier.) Perhaps Congress would\u2014perhaps Congress should\u2014make the\nidentical judgment for the full range of lawsuits pertaining to the\nGovernment\u2019s ownership of land. But that is not our call. The Band\nassumes that plaintiffs like Patchak have a lesser interest than\nthose bringing quiet title actions, and so should be precludeda\u00a0fortiori. But all we can say is that Patchak has a\ndifferent interest. Whether it is lesser, as the Band argues,\nbecause not based on property rights; whether it is greater because\nimplicating public interests; or whether it is in the end exactly\nthe same\u2014that is for Congress to tell us, not for us to tell\nCongress. As the matter stands, Congress has not assimilated to\nquiet title actions all other suits challenging the Government\u2019s\nownership of property. And so when a plaintiff like Patchak brings\na suit like this one, it falls within the APA\u2019s general waiver of\nsovereign immunity.IIIWe finally consider the Band\u2019s and the\nGovernment\u2019s alternative argument that Patchak cannot bring this\nac- tion because he lacks prudential standing. This Court has long\nheld that a person suing under the APA must satisfy not only\nArticle III\u2019s standing requirements, but an additional test: The\ninterest he asserts must be \u201carguably within the zone of interests\nto be protected or regulated by the statute\u201d that he says was\nviolated.Association of Data Processing Service Organizations,\nInc.v.Camp,397 U.S.\n150, 153 (1970). Here, Patchak asserts that in taking title to\nthe Bradley Property, the Secretary exceeded her authority under\n\u00a7465, which authorizes the acquisition of property \u201cfor the purpose\nof providing land for Indians.\u201d And he alleges that this statutory\nviolation will cause him economic, environmental, and aesthetic\nharm as a nearby property owner. Seesupra,at 3. The\nGovernment and Band argue that the relationship between \u00a7465 and\nPatchak\u2019s asserted interests is insufficient. That is so, they\ncontend, because the statute focuses on landacquisition,\nwhereas Patchak\u2019s interests relate to the land\u2019suseas a\ncasino. See Brief for Tribal Petitioner 46 (\u201cThe Secretary\u2019s\ndecision to put land into trust does not turn on any particular use\nof the land, gaming or otherwise[,] . . . [and] thus has no impact\non [Patchak] or his asserted interests\u201d); Brief for Federal\nPetitioners 34 (\u201c[L]and may be taken into trust for a host of\npurposes that have noth- ing at all to do with gaming\u201d). We find\nthis argument unpersuasive.The prudential standing test Patchak must meet\n\u201cis not meant to be especially demanding.\u201dClarkev.Securities Industry Assn.,479 U.S.\n388, 399 (1987). We apply the test in keeping with Congress\u2019s\n\u201cevident intent\u201d when enacting the APA \u201cto make agency action\npresumptively reviewable.\u201dIbid.We do not require any\n\u201cindication of congressional purpose to benefit the would-be\nplaintiff.\u201dId.,at 399\u2013400.[7] And we have always conspicuously included the word\n\u201carguably\u201d in the test to indicate that the benefit of any doubt\ngoes to the plaintiff. The test forecloses suit only when a\nplaintiff\u2019s \u201cinterests are so marginally related to or inconsistent\nwith the purposes implicit in the statute that it cannot reasonably\nbe assumed that Congress intended to permit the suit.\u201dId.,\nat 399.Patchak\u2019s suit satisfies that standard, because\n\u00a7465 has far more to do with land use than the Government and Band\nacknowledge. Start with what we and others have said about \u00a7465\u2019s\ncontext and purpose. As the leading treatise on federal Indian law\nnotes, \u00a7465 is \u201cthe capstone\u201d of the IRA\u2019s land provisions. F.\nCohen, Handbook of Federal Indian Law \u00a715.07[1][a], p. 1010 (2005\ned.) (hereinafter Cohen). And those provisions play a key role in\nthe IRA\u2019s overall effort \u201cto rehabilitate the Indian\u2019s economic\nlife,\u201dMescalero Apache Tribev.Jones,411 U.S.\n145, 152 (1973) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cLand forms\nthe basis\u201d of that \u201ceconomic life,\u201d providing the foundation for\n\u201ctourism, manufacturing, mining, logging,\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. and\ngaming.\u201d Cohen \u00a715.01, at 965. Section 465 thus functions as a\nprimary mechanism to foster Indian tribes\u2019 economic development. As\nthe D.\u00a0C. Circuit explained in theMichGOlitigation,\nthe section \u201cprovid[es] lands sufficient to enable Indians to\nachieve self-support.\u201dMichigan Gambling, 525 F.\u00a03d, at\n31 (internal quotation marks omitted); seeMortonv.Mancari,417 U.S.\n535, 542 (1974) (noting the IRA\u2019s economic aspect). So when the\nSecretary obtains land for Indians under \u00a7465, she does not do so\nin a vacuum. Rather, she takes title to properties with at least\none eye directed toward how tribes will use those lands to support\neconomic development.The Department\u2019s regulations make this statutory\nconcern with land use crystal clear. Those regulations permit the\nSecretary to acquire land in trust under \u00a7465 if the \u201cland is\nnecessary to facilitate tribal self-determination, economic\ndevelopment, or Indian housing.\u201d 25 CFR \u00a7151.3(a)(3). And they\nrequire the Secretary to consider, in evaluating any acquisition,\nboth \u201c[t]he purposes for which the land will be used\u201d and the\n\u201cpoten- tial conflicts of land use which may arise.\u201d \u00a7\u00a7151.10(c),\n151.10(f); see \u00a7151.11(a). For \u201coff-reservation acquisitions\u201d made\n\u201cfor business purposes\u201d\u2014like the Bradley Property\u2014the regulations\nfurther provide that the tribe must \u201cprovide a plan which specifies\nthe anticipated economic benefits associated with the proposed\nuse.\u201d \u00a7151.11(c). DOI\u2019s regulations thus show that the statute\u2019s\nimplementation centrally depends on the projected use of a given\nproperty.The Secretary\u2019s acquisition of the Bradley\nProperty is a case in point. The Band\u2019s application to the\nSecretary highlighted its plan to use the land for gaming purposes.\nSee App. 41 (\u201c[T]rust status for this Property is requested in\norder for the Tribe to acquire property on which it plans to\nconduct gaming\u201d);id.,at 61\u201362 (\u201cThe Tribe intends to\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. renovate the existing .\u00a0.\u00a0. building into\na gaming fa- cility .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. to offer Class II and/or\nClass III gaming\u201d). Simi- larly, DOI\u2019s notice of intent to take the\nland into trust announced that the land would \u201cbe used for the\npurpose of construction and operation of a gaming facility,\u201d which\nthe Department had already determined would meet the Indian Gaming\nRegulatory Act\u2019s requirements. 70 Fed. Reg. 25596; 25\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a72701\u20132721. So from start to finish, the\ndecision whether to acquire the Bradley Prop- erty under \u00a7465\ninvolved questions of land use.And because \u00a7465\u2019s implementation encompasses\nthese issues, the interests Patchak raises\u2014at least arguably\u2014 fall\n\u201cwithin the zone .\u00a0.\u00a0. protected or regulated by the\nstatute.\u201d If the Government had violated a statute specifically\naddressing how federal land can be used, no one would doubt that a\nneighboring landowner would have prudential standing to bring suit\nto enforce the statute\u2019s limits. The difference here, as the\nGovernment and Band point out, is that \u00a7465 specifically addresses\nonly land ac- quisition. But for the reasons already given,\ndecisions under the statute are closely enough and often enough\nentwined with considerations of land use to make that difference\nimmaterial. As in this very case, the Secretary will typically\nacquire land with its eventual use in mind, after assessing\npotential conflicts that use might create. See 25 CFR \u00a7\u00a7151.10(c),\n151.10(f), 151.11(a). And so neighbors to the use (like Patchak)\nare reasonable\u2014indeed, predictable\u2014challengers of the Secretary\u2019s\ndecisions: Their interests, whether economic, environmental, or\naesthetic, come within \u00a7465\u2019s regulatory ambit.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*The QTA\u2019s reservation of sovereign immunity\ndoes not bar Patchak\u2019s suit. Neither does the doctrine of\nprudential standing. We therefore affirm the judgment of the\nD.\u00a0C. Circuit, and remand the case for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.Notes1Under the Indian Gaming\nRegulatory Act, 25 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a72701\u20132721, an Indian tribe\nmay conduct gaming operations on \u201cIndian lands,\u201d \u00a72710, which\ninclude lands \u201cheld in trust by the United States for the benefit\nof any Indian tribe,\u201d \u00a72703(4)(B). The application thus re-quested\nthe Secretary to take the action necessary for the Band toopen a\ncasino.2The merits of Patchak\u2019s\ncase are not before this Court. We therefore express no view on\nwhether the Band was \u201cunder federal jurisdiction\u201d in 1934, asCarcierirequires. Nor do we consider how that question\nrelates to Patchak\u2019s allegation that the Band was not \u201cfederally\nrecognized\u201d at the time. Cf.Carcieri,555 U.\u00a0S., at\n397\u2013399 (Breyer, J., concurring) (discussing this\nissue).3According to the dissent,\nwe should look only to the kind of relief a plaintiff seeks, rather\nthan the type of grievance he asserts, in deciding whether another\nstatute bars an APA action. Seepost, at 6 (opinion of\nSotomayor, J.). But the dissent\u2019s test is inconsistent with the one\nwe adopted inBlock, which asked whether Congress had\nparticularly dealt with a \u201cclaim.\u201d SeeBlockv.North\nDakota ex\u00a0rel. Board of Univ. and School Lands,461\nU.S. 273, 286, n. 22 (1983). And the dissent\u2019s approach has no\nobvious limits. Suppose, for example, that Congress passed a\nstatute authorizing a particular form of injunctive relief in a\nprocurement contract suit except when the suit involved a\n\u201cdiscretionary function\u201d of a federal employee. Cf. 28\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72680(a). Under the dissent\u2019s method, that\nexception would precludeanyAPA suit seeking that kind of\ninjunctive relief if it involved a discretionary function, no\nmatter what the nature of the claim. That implausible result\ndemonstrates that limitations on relief cannot sensibly be\nun-derstood apart from the claims to which they\nattach.4The dissent contends that\nthe QTA omits two other historical requirements for quiet title\nsuits. Seepost, at 8.But many States had abandoned\nthose requirements by the time the QTA was passed. See S.\u00a0Rep.\nNo. 92\u2013575, p.\u00a06 (1971) (noting \u201cwide differences in State\nstatutory and decisional law\u201d on quiet title suits); Steadman,\n\u201cForgive the U.\u00a0S. Its Trespasses?\u201d: Land Title Disputes With\nthe Sovereign\u2014Present Remedies and Prospective Reforms, 1972 Duke\nL.\u00a0J. 15, 48\u201349, and n. 152 (stating that cases had disputed\nwhether a quiet title plaintiff needed to possess the land);Welchv.Kai,4 Cal. App. 3d 374, 380\u2013381,84 Cal. Rptr. 619, 622\u2013623 (1970) (allowing a quiet title\naction when the plaintiff claimed only an easement);Bensonv.Fekete,424 S.W.2d 729(Mo. 1968) (en banc) (same). So Congress in\nenacting the QTA essentially chose one contemporaneous form of\nquiet title action.5The legislative history,\nfor those who think it useful, further shows that the QTA addresses\nquiet title actions, as ordinarily conceived. The Senate Report\nstates that the QTA aimed to alleviate the \u201c[g]rave inequity\u201d to\nprivate parties \u201cexcluded, without benefit of a recourse to the\ncourts, from lands they have reason to believe are rightfully\ntheirs.\u201d S.\u00a0Rep. No. 92\u2013575, at\u00a01. Similarly, the\nHouse Report notes that the history of quiet title actions \u201cgoes\nback to the Courts of England,\u201d and provided as examples \u201ca\nplaintiff whose title to land was continually being subjected to\nlitigation in the law courts,\u201d and \u201cone who feared that an\noutstanding deed or other interest might cause a claim to be\npresented in the future.\u201d H.\u00a0R. Rep. No. 92\u20131559, p.\u00a06\n(1972). From top to bottom, these reports show that Congress\nthought itself to be authorizing bread-and-butter quiet title\nactions, in which a plaintiff asserts a right, title, or interest\nof his own in disputed land.6In a related vein, the\ndissent argues that our holding will undermine the QTA\u2019s \u201cIndian\nlands\u201d exception by allowing adverse claimants to file APA\ncomplaints concealing their ownership interests or to recruit third\nparties to bring suit on their behalf. Seepost, at 9\u201311.\nBut we think that concern more imaginary than real. We have trouble\nconceiving of a plausible APA suit that omits mention of an adverse\nclaimant\u2019s interest in property yet somehow leads to relief\nrecognizing that very interest.7For this reason, the\nBand\u2019s statement that Patchak is \u201cnot an Indian or tribal official\nseeking land\u201d and does not \u201cclaim an interest in advancing tribal\ndevelopment,\u201d Brief for Tribal Petitioner 42, is beside the point.\nThe question is not whether \u00a7465 seeks to benefit Patchak; everyone\ncan agree it does not. The question is instead, as the Band\u2019s and\nthe Government\u2019s main argument acknowledges, whether issues of land\nuse (arguably) fall within \u00a7465\u2019s scope\u2014because if they do, a\nneighbor complaining about such use may sue to enforce the\nstatute\u2019s limits.
