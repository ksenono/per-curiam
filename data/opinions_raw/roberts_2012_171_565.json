EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION\net\u00a0al.on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the sixth circuit[January 11, 2012]Chief Justice Roberts\ndelivered the opinion of the Court.Certain employment\ndiscrimination laws authorize employees who have been wrongfully\nterminated to sue their employers for reinstatement and damages.\nThe question presented is whether the Establishment and Free\nExercise Clauses of the First Amendment bar such an action when the\nemployer is a religious group and the employee is one of the\ngroup\u2019s ministers.IAPetitioner\nHosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church and School is a member\ncongregation of the Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod, the second\nlargest Lutheran denomination in America. Hosanna-Tabor operated a\nsmall school in Redford, Michigan, offering a \u201cChrist-centered\neducation\u201d to students in kindergarten through eighth grade. 582\nF.\u00a0Supp. 2d 881, 884 (ED Mich. 2008) (internal quotation marks\nomitted).The Synod classifies\nteachers into two categories: \u201ccalled\u201d and \u201clay.\u201d \u201cCalled\u201d teachers\nare regarded as having been called to their vocation by God through\na congregation. To be eligible to receive a call from a\ncongregation, a teacher must satisfy certain academic requirements.\nOne way of doing so is by completing a \u201ccolloquy\u201d program at a\nLutheran college or university. The program requires candidates to\ntake eight courses of theological study, obtain the endorsement of\ntheir local Synod district, and pass an oral examination by a\nfaculty committee. A teacher who meets these requirements may be\ncalled by a congregation. Once called, a teacher receives the\nformal title \u201cMinister of Religion, Commissioned.\u201d App. 42, 48. A\ncommissioned minister serves for an open-ended term; at\nHosanna-Tabor, a call could be rescinded only for cause and by a\nsupermajority vote of the congregation.\u201cLay\u201d or \u201ccontract\u201d\nteachers, by contrast, are not required to be trained by the Synod\nor even to be Lutheran. At Hosanna-Tabor, they were appointed by\nthe school board, without a vote of the congregation, to one-year\nrenewable terms. Although teachers at the school generally\nperformed the same duties regardless of whether they were lay or\ncalled, lay teachers were hired only when called teachers were\nunavailable.Respondent Cheryl\nPerich was first employed by Hosanna-Tabor as a lay teacher in\n1999. After Perich com-pleted her colloquy later that school year,\nHosanna-Tabor asked her to become a called teacher. Perich accepted\nthe call and received a \u201cdiploma of vocation\u201d designating her a\ncommissioned minister. Id., at 42.Perich taught\nkindergarten during her first four years at Hosanna-Tabor and\nfourth grade during the 2003\u20132004 school year. She taught math,\nlanguage arts, social studies, science, gym, art, and music. She\nalso taught a religion class four days a week, led the students in\nprayer and devotional exercises each day, and attended a weekly\nschool-wide chapel service. Perich led the chapel service herself\nabout twice a year.Perich became ill in\nJune 2004 with what was eventually diagnosed as narcolepsy.\nSymptoms included sudden and deep sleeps from which she could not\nbe roused. Because of her illness, Perich began the 2004\u20132005\nschool year on disability leave. On January 27, 2005, however,\nPerich notified the school principal, Stacey Hoeft, that she would\nbe able to report to work the following month. Hoeft responded that\nthe school had already contracted with a lay teacher to fill\nPerich\u2019s position for the remainder of the school year. Hoeft also\nexpressed concern that Perich was not yet ready to return to the\nclassroom.On January 30,\nHosanna-Tabor held a meeting of its congregation at which school\nadministrators stated that Perich was unlikely to be physically\ncapable of returning to work that school year or the next. The\ncongregation voted to offer Perich a \u201cpeaceful release\u201d from her\ncall, whereby the congregation would pay a portion of her health\ninsurance premiums in exchange for her resignation as a called\nteacher. Id., at 178, 186. Perich refused to resign and produced a\nnote from her doctor stating that she would be able to return to\nwork on February 22. The school board urged Perich to reconsider,\ninforming her that the school no longer had a position for her, but\nPerich stood by her decision not to resign.On the morning of\nFebruary 22\u2014the first day she was medically cleared to return to\nwork\u2014Perich presented herself at the school. Hoeft asked her to\nleave but she would not do so until she obtained written\ndocumentation that she had reported to work. Later that afternoon,\nHoeft called Perich at home and told her that she would likely be\nfired. Perich responded that she had spoken with an attorney and\nintended to assert her legal rights.Following a school\nboard meeting that evening, board chairman Scott Salo sent Perich a\nletter stating that Hosanna-Tabor was reviewing the process for\nrescinding her call in light of her \u201cregrettable\u201d actions. Id., at\n229. Salo subsequently followed up with a letter advising Perich\nthat the congregation would consider whether to rescind her call at\nits next meeting. As grounds for ter-mination, the letter cited\nPerich\u2019s \u201cinsubordination and disruptive behavior\u201d on February 22,\nas well as the damage she had done to her \u201cworking relationship\u201d\nwith the school by \u201cthreatening to take legal action.\u201d Id., at 55.\nThe congregation voted to rescind Perich\u2019s call on April 10, and\nHosanna-Tabor sent her a letter of termination the next day.BPerich filed a charge\nwith the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, alleging that her\nemployment had been terminated in violation of the Americans with\nDis-abilities Act, 104Stat. 327, 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a712101\net\u00a0seq. (1990). The ADA prohibits an employer from\ndiscriminating against a qualified individual on the basis of\ndisability. \u00a712112(a). It also prohibits an employer from\nretaliating \u201cagainst any individual because such individual has\nopposed any act or practice made unlawful by [the ADA] or because\nsuch individual made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated\nin any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under\n[the ADA].\u201d \u00a712203(a). [1]The EEOC brought suit\nagainst Hosanna-Tabor, alleging that Perich had been fired in\nretaliation for threat-ening to file an ADA lawsuit. Perich\nintervened in the litigation, claiming unlawful retaliation under\nboth the ADA and the Michigan Persons with Disabilities Civil\nRights Act, Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a737.1602(a) (1979). The EEOC and\nPerich sought Perich\u2019s reinstatement to her former position (or\nfrontpay in lieu thereof), along with backpay, compensatory and\npunitive damages, attorney\u2019s fees, and other injunctive relief.Hosanna-Tabor moved for\nsummary judgment. Invoking what is known as the \u201cministerial\nexception,\u201d the Church argued that the suit was barred by the First\nAmendment because the claims at issue concerned the employment\nrelationship between a religious institution and one of its\nministers. According to the Church, Perich was a minister, and she\nhad been fired for a religious reason\u2014namely, that her threat to\nsue the Church vio-lated the Synod\u2019s belief that Christians should\nresolve their disputes internally.The District Court\nagreed that the suit was barred by the ministerial exception and\ngranted summary judgment in Hosanna-Tabor\u2019s favor. The court\nexplained that \u201cHosanna-Tabor treated Perich like a minister and\nheld her out to the world as such long before this litigation\nbegan,\u201d and that the \u201cfacts surrounding Perich\u2019s employment in a\nreligious school with a sectarian mission\u201d supported the Church\u2019s\ncharacterization. 582 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d, at 891\u2013892. In light of\nthat determination, the court concluded that it could \u201cinquire no\nfurther into her claims of retaliation.\u201d Id., at 892.The Court of Appeals\nfor the Sixth Circuit vacated and remanded, directing the District\nCourt to proceed to the merits of Perich\u2019s retaliation claims. The\nCourt of Appeals recognized the existence of a ministerial\nexception barring certain employment discrimination claims against\nreligious institutions\u2014an exception \u201crooted in the First\nAmendment\u2019s guarantees of religious freedom.\u201d 597 F.\u00a03d 769,\n777 (2010). The court concluded, however, that Perich did not\nqualify as a \u201cminister\u201d under the exception, noting in particular\nthat her duties as a called teacher were identical to her duties as\na lay teacher. Id., at 778\u2013781. Judge White concurred. She viewed\nthe question whether Perich qualified as a minister to be closer\nthan did the majority, but agreed that the \u201cfact that the duties of\nthe contract teachers are the same as the duties of the called\nteachers is telling.\u201d Id., at 782, 784.We granted certiorari.\n563 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2011).IIThe First Amendment\nprovides, in part, that \u201cCongress shall make no law respecting an\nestablishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise\nthereof.\u201d We have said that these two Clauses \u201coften exert\nconflicting pressures,\u201d Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U.\u00a0S. 709,\n719 (2005) , and that there can be \u201cinternal tension\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. between the Establishment Clause and the Free\nExercise Clause,\u201d Tilton v. Richardson, 403 U.\u00a0S. 672, 677\n(1971) (plurality opinion). Not so here. Both Religion Clauses bar\nthe government from interfering with the decision of a religious\ngroup to fire one of its ministers.AControversy between\nchurch and state over religious offices is hardly new. In 1215, the\nissue was addressed in the very first clause of Magna Carta. There,\nKing John agreed that \u201cthe English church shall be free, and shall\nhave its rights undiminished and its liberties unimpaired.\u201d The\nKing in particular accepted the \u201cfreedom of elections,\u201d a right\n\u201cthought to be of the greatest necessity and importance to the\nEnglish church.\u201d J. Holt, Magna Carta App. IV, p.\u00a0317,\ncl.\u00a01 (1965).That freedom in many\ncases may have been more the-oretical than real. See, e.g., W.\nWarren, Henry II 312 (1973) (recounting the writ sent by Henry II\nto the electors of a bishopric in Winchester, stating: \u201cI order you\nto hold a free election, but forbid you to elect anyone but Richard\nmy clerk\u201d). In any event, it did not survive the reign of Henry\nVIII, even in theory. The Act of Supremacy of 1534, 26 Hen.\u00a08,\nch.\u00a01, made the English monarch the supreme head of the\nChurch, and the Act in Restraint of Annates, 25 Hen. 8,\nch.\u00a020, passed that same year, gave him the authority to\nappoint the Church\u2019s high officials. See G. Elton, The Tudor\nConstitution: Documents and Commentary 331\u2013332 (1960). Various Acts\nof Uniformity, enacted subsequently, tightened further the\ngovernment\u2019s grip on the exercise of religion. See, e.g., Act of\nUniformity, 1559, 1 Eliz., ch.\u00a02; Act of Uniformity, 1549, 2\n& 3 Edw.\u00a06, ch.\u00a01. The Uniformity Act of 1662, for\ninstance, limited service as a minister to those who formally\nassented to prescribed tenets and pledged to follow the mode of\nworship set forth in the Book of Common Prayer. Any minister who\nrefused to make that pledge was \u201cdeprived of all his Spiritual\nPromotions.\u201d Act of Uniformity, 1662, 14 Car.\u00a02,\nch.\u00a04.Seeking to escape the\ncontrol of the national church, the Puritans fled to New England,\nwhere they hoped to elect their own ministers and establish their\nown modes of worship. See T. Curry, The First Freedoms: Church and\nState in America to the Passage of the First Amendment 3 (1986);\nMcConnell, The Origins and Historical Understanding of Free\nExercise of Religion, 103 Harv. L.\u00a0Rev. 1409, 1422 (1990).\nWilliam Penn, the Quaker proprietor of what would eventually become\nPennsylvania and Delaware, also sought independence from the Church\nof England. The charter creating the province of Pennsylvania\ncontained no clause establishing a religion. See S. Cobb, The Rise\nof Religious Liberty in America 440\u2013441 (1970).Colonists in the South,\nin contrast, brought the Church of England with them. But even they\nsometimes chafed at the control exercised by the Crown and its\nrepresentatives over religious offices. In Virginia, for example,\nthe law vested the governor with the power to induct ministers\npresented to him by parish vestries, 2 Hening\u2019s Statutes at Large\n46 (1642), but the vestries often refused to make such\npresentations and instead chose ministers on their own. See H.\nEckenrode, Separation of Church and State in Virginia 13\u201319 (1910).\nControversies over the selection of ministers also arose in other\nColonies with Anglican establishments, including North Carolina.\nSee C. Antieau, A. Downey, & E. Roberts, Freedom from Federal\nEstablishment: Formation and Early History of the First Amendment\nReligion Clauses 10\u201311 (1964). There, the royal governor insisted\nthat the right of presentation lay with the Bishop of London, but\nthe colonial assembly enacted laws placing that right in the\nvestries. Authorities in England intervened, repealing those laws\nas inconsistent with the rights of the Crown. See id., at 11;\nWeeks, Church and State in North Carolina, Johns Hopkins U. Studies\nin Hist. & Pol. Sci., 11th Ser., Nos.\u00a05\u20136, pp.\u00a029\u201336\n(1893).It was against this\nbackground that the First Amendment was adopted. Familiar with life\nunder the established Church of England, the founding generation\nsought to foreclose the possibility of a national church. See 1\nAnnals of Cong. 730\u2013731 (1789) (noting that the Establishment\nClause addressed the fear that \u201cone sect might obtain a\npre-eminence, or two combine together, and establish a religion to\nwhich they would compel others to conform\u201d (remarks of J.\nMadison)). By forbidding the \u201cestablishment of religion\u201d and\nguaranteeing the \u201cfree exercise thereof,\u201d the Religion Clauses\nensured that the new Federal Government\u2014unlike the English\nCrown\u2014would have no role in filling ecclesiastical offices. The\nEstablishment Clause prevents the Government from appointing\nministers, and the Free Exercise Clause prevents it from\ninterfering with the freedom of religious groups to select their\nown.This understanding of\nthe Religion Clauses was reflected in two events involving James\nMadison, \u201c\u00a0\u2018the leading architect of the religion clauses of\nthe First Amendment.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Arizona Christian School Tuition\nOrganization v. Winn, 563 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at\n13) (quoting Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.\u00a0S. 83, 103 (1968) ). The\nfirst occurred in 1806, when John Carroll, the first Catholic\nbishop in the United States, solicited the Executive\u2019s opinion on\nwho should be appointed to direct the affairs of the Catholic\nChurch in the territory newly acquired by the Louisiana Purchase.\nAfter consulting with President Jefferson, then-Secretary of State\nMadison responded that the selection of church \u201cfunctionaries\u201d was\nan \u201centirely ecclesiastical\u201d matter left to the Church\u2019s own\njudgment. Letter from James Madison to Bishop Carroll (Nov. 20,\n1806), reprinted in 20 Records of the American Catholic Historical\nSociety 63 (1909). The \u201cscrupulous policy of the Constitution in\nguarding against a political interference with religious affairs,\u201d\nMadison explained, prevented the Government from rendering an\nopinion on the \u201cselection of ecclesiastical individuals.\u201d Id., at\n63\u201364.The second episode\noccurred in 1811, when Madison was President. Congress had passed a\nbill incorporating the Protestant Episcopal Church in the town of\nAlexandria in what was then the District of Columbia. Madison\nvetoed the bill, on the ground that it \u201cexceeds the rightful\nauthority to which Governments are limited, by the essential\ndistinction between civil and religious functions, and violates, in\nparticular, the article of the Constitution of the United States,\nwhich declares, that \u2018Congress shall make no law respecting a\nreligious establishment.\u2019\u00a0\u201d 22 Annals of Cong. 982\u2013983 (1811).\nMadison explained:\u201cThe bill enacts into, and establishes by\nlaw, sundry rules and proceedings relative purely to the\norgani-zation and polity of the church incorporated, and\ncomprehending even the election and removal of the Minister of the\nsame; so that no change could be made therein by the particular\nsociety, or by the general church of which it is a member, and\nwhose authority it recognises.\u201d Id., at 983 (emphasis added).BGiven this\nunderstanding of the Religion Clauses\u2014and the absence of government\nemployment regulation generally\u2014it was some time before questions\nabout government interference with a church\u2019s ability to select its\nown ministers came before the courts. This Court touched upon the\nissue indirectly, however, in the context of disputes over church\nproperty. Our decisions in that area confirm that it is\nimpermissible for the government to contradict a church\u2019s\ndetermination of who can act as its ministers.In Watson v. Jones, 13\nWall. 679 (1872), the Court considered a dispute between\nantislavery and proslavery factions over who controlled the\nproperty of the Walnut Street Presbyterian Church in Louisville,\nKentucky. The General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church had\nrecognized the antislavery faction, and this Court\u2014applying not the\nConstitution but a \u201cbroad and sound view of the relations of church\nand state under our system of laws\u201d\u2014declined to question that\ndetermination. Id., at 727. We explained that \u201cwhenever the\nquestions of discipline, or of faith, or ecclesiastical rule,\ncustom, or law have been decided by the highest of [the] church\njudicatories to which the matter has been carried, the legal\ntribunals must accept such decisions as final, and as binding on\nthem.\u201d Ibid. As we would put it later, our opinion in Watson\n\u201cradiates .\u00a0.\u00a0. a spirit of freedom for religious\norganizations, an independence from secular control or\nmanipulation\u2014in short, power to decide for themselves, free from\nstate interference, matters of church government as well as those\nof faith and doctrine.\u201d Kedroff v. Saint Nicholas Cathedral of\nRussian Orthodox Church in North America, 344 U.\u00a0S. 94, 116\n(1952) .Confronting the issue\nunder the Constitution for the first time in Kedroff, the Court\nrecognized that the \u201c[f\u00a0]reedom to select the clergy, where no\nimproper methods of choice are proven,\u201d is \u201cpart of the free\nexercise of religion\u201d protected by the First Amendment against\ngovernment interference. Ibid. At issue in Kedroff was the right to\nuse a Russian Orthodox cathedral in New York City. The Russian\nOrthodox churches in North America had split from the Supreme\nChurch Authority in Moscow, out of concern that the Authority had\nbecome a tool of the Soviet Government. The North American churches\nclaimed that the right to use the cathedral belonged to an\narchbishop elected by them; the Supreme Church Authority claimed\nthat it belonged instead to an archbishop appointed by the\npatriarch in Moscow. New York\u2019s highest court ruled in favor of the\nNorth American churches, based on a state law requiring every\nRussian Orthodox church in New York to recognize the determination\nof the governing body of the North American churches as\nauthoritative. Id., at 96\u201397, 99, n.\u00a03, 107, n. 10.This Court reversed,\nconcluding that the New York law violated the First Amendment. Id.,\nat 107. We explained that the controversy over the right to use the\ncathedral was \u201cstrictly a matter of ecclesiastical government, the\npower of the Supreme Church Authority of the Russian Orthodox\nChurch to appoint the ruling hierarch of the archdiocese of North\nAmerica.\u201d Id., at 115. By \u201cpass[ing] the control of matters\nstrictly ecclesiastical from one church authority to another,\u201d the\nNew York law intruded the \u201cpower of the state into the forbidden\narea of reli- gious freedom contrary to the principles of the First\nAmend-ment.\u201d Id., at 119. Accordingly, we declared the law\nunconstitutional because it \u201cdirectly prohibit[ed] the free\nexercise of an ecclesiastical right, the Church\u2019s choice of its\nhierarchy.\u201d Ibid.This Court reaffirmed\nthese First Amendment principles in Serbian Eastern Orthodox\nDiocese for United States and Canada v. Milivojevich, 426\nU.\u00a0S. 696 (1976) , a case involving a dispute over control of\nthe American-Canadian Diocese of the Serbian Orthodox Church,\nincluding its property and assets. The Church had removed Dionisije\nMilivojevich as bishop of the American-Canadian Diocese because of\nhis defiance of the church hierarchy. Following his removal,\nDionisije brought a civil action in state court challenging the\nChurch\u2019s decision, and the Illinois Supreme Court \u201cpurported in\neffect to reinstate Dionisije as Diocesan Bishop,\u201d on the ground\nthat the proceedings resulting in his removal failed to comply with\nchurch laws and regulations. Id., at 708.Reversing that\njudgment, this Court explained that the First Amendment \u201cpermit[s]\nhierarchical religious organizations to establish their own rules\nand regulations for internal discipline and government, and to\ncreate tribunals for adjudicating disputes over these matters.\u201d\nId., at 724. When ecclesiastical tribunals decide such disputes, we\nfurther explained, \u201cthe Constitution requires that civil courts\naccept their decisions as binding upon them.\u201d Id., at 725. We thus\nheld that by inquiring into whether the Church had followed its own\nprocedures, the State Supreme Court had \u201cunconstitutionally\nundertaken the resolution of quintessentially religious\ncontroversies whose resolution the First Amendment commits\nexclusively to the highest ecclesiastical tribunals\u201d of the Church.\nId., at 720.CUntil today, we have\nnot had occasion to consider whether this freedom of a religious\norganization to select its ministers is implicated by a suit\nalleging discrimination in employment. The Courts of Appeals, in\ncontrast, have had extensive experience with this issue. Since the\npassage of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72000e et\u00a0seq., and other employment\ndiscrimination laws, the Courts of Appeals have uniformly\nrecognized the existence of a \u201cministerial exception,\u201d grounded in\nthe First Amendment, that precludes application of such legislation\nto claims concerning the employment relationship between a\nreligious institution and its ministers. [2]We agree that there is\nsuch a ministerial exception. The members of a religious group put\ntheir faith in the hands of their ministers. Requiring a church to\naccept or retain an unwanted minister, or punishing a church for\nfailing to do so, intrudes upon more than a mere employment\ndecision. Such action interferes with the internal governance of\nthe church, depriving the church of control over the selection of\nthose who will personify its beliefs. By imposing an unwanted\nminister, the state infringes the Free Exercise Clause, which\nprotects a religious group\u2019s right to shape its own faith and\nmission through its appointments. According the state the power to\ndetermine which individuals will minister to the faithful also\nviolates the Establishment Clause, which prohibits government\ninvolvement in such ecclesiastical decisions.The EEOC and Perich\nacknowledge that employment discrimination laws would be\nunconstitutional as applied to religious groups in certain\ncircumstances. They grant, for example, that it would violate the\nFirst Amendment for courts to apply such laws to compel the\nordination of women by the Catholic Church or by an Orthodox Jewish\nseminary. Brief for Federal Respondent 31; Brief for Respondent\nPerich 35\u201336. According to the EEOC and Perich, religious\norganizations could successfully defend against employment\ndiscrimination claims in those circum-stances by invoking the\nconstitutional right to freedom of association\u2014a right \u201cimplicit\u201d\nin the First Amendment. Roberts v. United States Jaycees, 468\nU.\u00a0S. 609, 622 (1984) . The EEOC and Perich thus see no\nneed\u2014and no basis\u2014for a special rule for ministers grounded in the\nReligion Clauses themselves.We find this position\nuntenable. The right to freedom of association is a right enjoyed\nby religious and secular groups alike. It follows under the EEOC\u2019s\nand Perich\u2019s view that the First Amendment analysis should be the\nsame, whether the association in question is the Lutheran Church, a\nlabor union, or a social club. See Perich Brief 31; Tr. of Oral\nArg. 28. That result is hard to square with the text of the First\nAmendment itself, which gives spe-cial solicitude to the rights of\nreligious organizations. We cannot accept the remarkable view that\nthe Religion Clauses have nothing to say about a religious\norganization\u2019s freedom to select its own ministers.The EEOC and Perich\nalso contend that our decision in Employment Div., Dept. of Human\nResources of Ore. v. Smith, 494 U.\u00a0S. 872 (1990) , precludes\nrecognition of a ministerial exception. In Smith, two members of\nthe Native American Church were denied state unemployment benefits\nafter it was determined that they had been fired from their jobs\nfor ingesting peyote, a crime under Oregon law. We held that this\ndid not violate the Free Exercise Clause, even though the peyote\nhad been ingested for sacramental purposes, because the \u201cright of\nfree exercise does not relieve an individual of the obligation to\ncomply with a valid and neutral law of general applicability on the\nground that the law proscribes (or prescribes) conduct that his\nreligion prescribes (or proscribes).\u201d Id., at 879 (internal\nquotation marks omitted).It is true that the\nADA\u2019s prohibition on retaliation, like Oregon\u2019s prohibition on\npeyote use, is a valid and neutral law of general applicability.\nBut a church\u2019s selection of its ministers is unlike an individual\u2019s\ningestion of peyote. Smith involved government regulation of only\noutward physical acts. The present case, in contrast, concerns\ngovernment interference with an internal church decision that\naffects the faith and mission of the church itself. See id., at 877\n(distinguishing the government\u2019s regulation of \u201cphysical acts\u201d from\nits \u201clend[ing] its power to one or the other side in controversies\nover religious authority or dogma\u201d). The contention that Smith\nforecloses recognition of a ministerial exception rooted in the\nReligion Clauses has no merit.IIIHaving concluded that\nthere is a ministerial exception grounded in the Religion Clauses\nof the First Amendment, we consider whether the exception applies\nin this case. We hold that it does.Every Court of Appeals\nto have considered the question has concluded that the ministerial\nexception is not limited to the head of a religious congregation,\nand we agree. We are reluctant, however, to adopt a rigid formula\nfor deciding when an employee qualifies as a minister. It is enough\nfor us to conclude, in this our first case involving the\nministerial exception, that the exception covers Perich, given all\nthe circumstances of her employment.To begin with,\nHosanna-Tabor held Perich out as a minister, with a role distinct\nfrom that of most of its members. When Hosanna-Tabor extended her a\ncall, it issued her a \u201cdiploma of vocation\u201d according her the title\n\u201cMinister of Religion, Commissioned.\u201d App.\u00a042. She was tasked\nwith performing that office \u201caccording to the Word of God and the\nconfessional standards of the Evangelical Lutheran Church as drawn\nfrom the Sacred Scriptures.\u201d Ibid. The congregation prayed that God\n\u201cbless [her] ministrations to the glory of His holy name, [and] the\nbuilding of His church.\u201d Id., at 43. In a supplement to the\ndiploma, the congregation undertook to periodically review Perich\u2019s\n\u201cskills of ministry\u201d and \u201cministerial responsibilities,\u201d and to\nprovide for her \u201ccontinuing education as a professional person in\nthe ministry of the Gospel.\u201d Id., at 49.Perich\u2019s title as a\nminister reflected a significant degree of religious training\nfollowed by a formal process of commissioning. To be eligible to\nbecome a commissioned minister, Perich had to complete eight\ncollege-level courses in subjects including biblical\ninterpretation, church doctrine, and the ministry of the Lutheran\nteacher. She also had to obtain the endorsement of her local Synod\ndistrict by submitting a petition that contained her academic\ntranscripts, letters of recommendation, personal statement, and\nwritten answers to various ministry-related questions. Finally, she\nhad to pass an oral examination by a faculty committee at a\nLutheran college. It took Perich six years to fulfill these\nrequirements. And when she eventually did, she was commissioned as\na minister only upon election by the congregation, which recognized\nGod\u2019s call to her to teach. At that point, her call could be\nrescinded only upon a supermajority vote of the congregation\u2014a\nprotection designed to allow her to \u201cpreach the Word of God\nboldly.\u201d Brief for Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod as Amicus Curiae\n15.Perich held herself out\nas a minister of the Church by accepting the formal call to\nreligious service, according to its terms. She did so in other ways\nas well. For example, she claimed a special housing allowance on\nher taxes that was available only to employees earning their\ncompensation \u201c\u00a0\u2018in the exercise of the ministry.\u2019\u00a0\u201d App.\n220 (\u201cIf you are not conducting activities \u2018in the exercise of the\nministry,\u2019 you cannot take advantage of the parsonage or housing\nallowance exclusion\u201d (quoting Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod\nBrochure on Whether the IRS Considers Employees as a Minister\n(2007)). In a form she submitted to the Synod following her\ntermination, Perich again indicated that she regarded herself as a\nminister at Hosanna-Tabor, stating: \u201cI feel that God is leading me\nto serve in the teaching ministry .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. I am\nanxious to be in the teaching ministry again soon.\u201d\nApp.\u00a053.Perich\u2019s job duties\nreflected a role in conveying the Church\u2019s message and carrying out\nits mission. Hosanna-Tabor expressly charged her with \u201clead[ing]\nothers toward Christian maturity\u201d and \u201cteach[ing] faithfully the\nWord of God, the Sacred Scriptures, in its truth and purity and as\nset forth in all the symbolical books of the Evangelical Lutheran\nChurch.\u201d Id., at 48. In fulfilling these responsibilities, Perich\ntaught her students religion four days a week, and led them in\nprayer three times a day. Once a week, she took her students to a\nschool-wide chapel service, and\u2014about twice a year\u2014she took her\nturn leading it, choosing the liturgy, selecting the hymns, and\ndelivering a short message based on verses from the Bible. During\nher last year of teaching, Perich also led her fourth graders in a\nbrief devotional exercise each morning. As a source of religious\ninstruction, Perich performed an important role in transmitting the\nLutheran faith to the next generation.In light of these\nconsiderations\u2014the formal title given Perich by the Church, the\nsubstance reflected in that title, her own use of that title, and\nthe important religious functions she performed for the Church\u2014we\nconclude that Perich was a minister covered by the ministerial\nexception.In reaching a contrary\nconclusion, the Court of Appeals committed three errors. First, the\nSixth Circuit failed to see any relevance in the fact that Perich\nwas a commissioned minister. Although such a title, by itself, does\nnot automatically ensure coverage, the fact that an employee has\nbeen ordained or commissioned as a minister is surely relevant, as\nis the fact that significant religious training and a recognized\nreligious mission underlie the description of the employee\u2019s\nposition. It was wrong for the Court of Appeals\u2014and Perich, who has\nadopted the court\u2019s view, see Perich Brief 45\u2014to say that an\nemployee\u2019s title does not matter.Second, the Sixth\nCircuit gave too much weight to the fact that lay teachers at the\nschool performed the same religious duties as Perich. We express no\nview on whether someone with Perich\u2019s duties would be covered by\nthe ministerial exception in the absence of the other\nconsiderations we have discussed. But though relevant, it cannot be\ndispositive that others not formally recognized as ministers by the\nchurch perform the same functions\u2014particularly when, as here, they\ndid so only because commissioned ministers were unavailable.Third, the Sixth\nCircuit placed too much emphasis on Perich\u2019s performance of secular\nduties. It is true that her religious duties consumed only 45\nminutes of each workday, and that the rest of her day was devoted\nto teaching secular subjects. The EEOC regards that as conclusive,\ncontending that any ministerial exception \u201cshould be limited to\nthose employees who perform exclusively religious functions.\u201d Brief\nfor Federal Respondent 51. We cannot accept that view. Indeed, we\nare unsure whether any such employees exist. The heads of\ncongregations themselves often have a mix of duties, including\nsecular ones such as helping to manage the congregation\u2019s finances,\nsupervising purely secular personnel, and overseeing the upkeep of\nfacilities.Although the Sixth\nCircuit did not adopt the extreme position pressed here by the\nEEOC, it did regard the relative amount of time Perich spent\nperforming religious functions as largely determinative. The issue\nbefore us, however, is not one that can be resolved by a stopwatch.\nThe amount of time an employee spends on particular activities is\nrelevant in assessing that employee\u2019s status, but that factor\ncannot be considered in isolation, without regard to the nature of\nthe religious functions performed and the other considerations\ndiscussed above.Because Perich was a\nminister within the meaning of the exception, the First Amendment\nrequires dismissal of this employment discrimination suit against\nher religious employer. The EEOC and Perich originally sought an\norder reinstating Perich to her former position as a called\nteacher. By requiring the Church to accept a minister it did not\nwant, such an order would have plainly violated the Church\u2019s\nfreedom under the Religion Clauses to select its own ministers.Perich no longer seeks\nreinstatement, having abandoned that relief before this Court. See\nPerich Brief 58. But that is immaterial. Perich continues to seek\nfrontpay in lieu of reinstatement, backpay, compensatory and\npunitive damages, and attorney\u2019s fees. An award of such relief\nwould operate as a penalty on the Church for terminating an\nunwanted minister, and would be no less prohibited by the First\nAmendment than an order overturning the termination. Such relief\nwould depend on a determination that Hosanna-Tabor was wrong to\nhave relieved Perich of her position, and it is precisely such a\nruling that is barred by the ministerial exception. [3]The EEOC and Perich\nsuggest that Hosanna-Tabor\u2019s asserted religious reason for firing\nPerich\u2014that she violated the Synod\u2019s commitment to internal dispute\nresolution\u2014was pretextual. That suggestion misses the point of the\nministerial exception. The purpose of the exception is not to\nsafeguard a church\u2019s decision to fire a minister only when it is\nmade for a religious reason. The exception instead ensures that the\nauthority to select and control who will minister to the faithful\u2014a\nmatter \u201cstrictly ecclesiastical,\u201d Kedroff, 344 U.\u00a0S., at\n119\u2014is the church\u2019s alone. [4]IVThe EEOC and Perich\nforesee a parade of horribles that will follow our recognition of a\nministerial exception to employment discrimination suits. According\nto the EEOC and Perich, such an exception could protect religious\norganizations from liability for retaliating against employees for\nreporting criminal misconduct or for testifying before a grand jury\nor in a criminal trial. What is more, the EEOC contends, the logic\nof the exception would confer on religious employers \u201cunfettered\ndiscretion\u201d to violate employment laws by, for example, hiring\nchildren or aliens not authorized to work in the United States.\nBrief for Federal Respondent 29.Hosanna-Tabor responds\nthat the ministerial exception would not in any way bar criminal\nprosecutions for in-terfering with law enforcement investigations\nor other proceedings. Nor, according to the Church, would the\nexception bar government enforcement of general laws restricting\neligibility for employment, because the exception applies only to\nsuits by or on behalf of ministers themselves. Hosanna-Tabor also\nnotes that the ministe-rial exception has been around in the lower\ncourts for 40 years, see McClure v. Salvation Army, 460 F.\u00a02d\n553, 558 (CA5 1972), and has not given rise to the dire\nconsequences predicted by the EEOC and Perich.The case before us is\nan employment discrimination suit brought on behalf of a minister,\nchallenging her church\u2019s decision to fire her. Today we hold only\nthat the ministerial exception bars such a suit. We express no view\non whether the exception bars other types of suits, including\nactions by employees alleging breach of contract or tortious\nconduct by their religious employers. There will be time enough to\naddress the applicability of the exception to other circumstances\nif and when they arise.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*The interest of\nsociety in the enforcement of employment discrimination statutes is\nundoubtedly important. But so too is the interest of religious\ngroups in choosing who will preach their beliefs, teach their\nfaith, and carry out their mission. When a minister who has been\nfired sues her church alleging that her termination was\ndiscriminatory, the First Amendment has struck the balance for us.\nThe church must be free to choose those who will guide it on its\nway.The judgment of the\nCourt of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit is reversed.It is so ordered.Notes1The ADA itself provides\nreligious entities with two defenses to claims of discrimination\nthat arise under subchapter I of the Act. The first provides that\n\u201c[t]his subchapter shall not prohibit a religious corporation,\nassociation, educational institution, or society from giving\npreference in employment to individuals of a particular religion to\nperform work connected with the carrying on by such [entity] of its\nactivities.\u201d \u00a712113(d)(1) (2006 ed., Supp. III). The second\nprovides that \u201c[u]nder this subchapter, a religious organization\nmay require that all applicants and employees conform to the\nreligious tenets of such organization.\u201d \u00a712113(d)(2). The ADA\u2019s\nprohibition against retaliation, \u00a712203(a), appears in a different\nsubchapter\u2014subchapter IV. The EEOC and Perich contend, and\nHosanna-Tabor does not dispute, that these defenses therefore do\nnot apply to retaliation claims.2See Natal v. Christian\nand Missionary Alliance, 878 F.\u00a02d 1575, 1578 (CA1 1989);\nRweyemamu v. Cote, 520 F.\u00a03d 198, 204\u2013209 (CA2 2008); Petruska\nv.

Salvation Army,\n518 F.\u00a03d 472, 475 (CA7 2008); Scharon v. St. Luke\u2019s Episcopal\nPresbyterian Hospitals, 929 F.\u00a02d 360, 362\u2013363 (CA8 1991);\nWerft v. Desert Southwest Annual Conference, 377 F.\u00a03d 1099,\n1100\u20131104 (CA9 2004); Bryce v. Episcopal Church, 289 F.\u00a03d\n648, 655\u2013657 (CA10 2002); Gellington v. Christian Methodist\nEpiscopal Church, Inc., 203 F.\u00a03d 1299, 1301\u20131304 (CA11 2000);\nEEOC v. Catholic Univ., 83 F. 3d 455, 460\u2013463 (CADC\n1996).3Perich does not dispute\nthat if the ministerial exception bars her retaliation claim under\nthe ADA, it also bars her retaliation claim under Michigan\nlaw.4A conflict has arisen in\nthe Courts of Appeals over whether the ministerial exception is a\njurisdictional bar or a defense on the merits. Compare Hollins, 474\nF.\u00a03d, at 225 (treating the exception as jurisdictional); and\nTomic v. Catholic Diocese of Peoria, 442 F.\u00a03d 1036, 1038\u20131039\n(CA7 2006) (same), with Petruska, 462 F.\u00a03d, at 302 (treating\nthe exception as an affirmative defense); Bryce, 289 F.\u00a03d, at\n654 (same); Bollard v. California Province of Soc. of Jesus, 196\nF.\u00a03d 940, 951 (CA9 1999) (same); and Natal, 878 F.\u00a02d,\nat 1576 (same). We conclude that the exception operates as an\naffirmative defense to an otherwise cognizable claim, not a\njurisdictional bar. That is because the issue presented by the\nexception is \u201cwhether the allegations the plaintiff makes entitle\nhim to relief,\u201d not whether the court has \u201cpower to hear [the]\ncase.\u201d Morrison v. National Australia Bank Ltd., 561 U.\u00a0S.\n___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 4\u20135) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). District courts have power to consider ADA claims in\ncases of this sort, and to decide whether the claim can proceed or\nis instead barred by the ministerial exception.",
