    "text": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES_________________No. 13\u2013604_________________NICHOLAS BRADY HEIEN, PETITIONERv.NORTH CAROLINAon writ of certiorari to the supreme court of north carolina[December 15, 2014]Justice Kagan, with whom Justice Ginsburg joins, concurring.I concur in full in the Court\u2019s opinion, which explains why\ncertain mistakes of law can support the reasonable suspicion needed\nto stop a vehicle under the Fourth Amendment. In doing so, the\nCourt correctly emphasizes that the \u201c Fourth Amendment tolerates\nonly .\u00a0.\u00a0.objectivelyreasonable\u201d mistakes of\nlaw.Ante, at 11. And the Court makes clear that the inquiry\ninto whether an officer\u2019s mistake of law counts as objectively\nreasonable \u201cis not as forgiving as the one employed in the distinct\ncontext of deciding whether an officer is entitled to qualified\nimmunity.\u201dIbid. I write separately to elaborate briefly on\nthose important limitations.[1]First, an officer\u2019s \u201csubjective understanding\u201d is irrelevant: As\nthe Court notes, \u201c[w]e do not examine\u201d it at all.Ibid.That\nmeans the government cannot defend an officer\u2019s mistaken legal\ninterpretation on the ground that the officer was unaware of or\nuntrained in the law. And it means that, contrary to the dissenting\nopinion in the court below, an officer\u2019s reliance on \u201can incorrect\nmemo or training program from the police department\u201d makes no\ndifference to the analysis. 366 N.\u00a0C. 271, 284, 737 S.\u00a0E.\n2d 351, 360 (2012) (Hudson, J., dissenting). Those considerations\npertain to the officer\u2019s subjective understanding of the law and\nthus cannot help to justify a seizure.Second, the inquiry the Court permits today is more demanding\nthan the one courts undertake before awarding qualified immunity.\nSee Tr. of Oral Arg. 51 (Solicitor General stating that the two\ntests \u201crequire essentially the opposite\u201d showings); Brief for\nRespondent 31\u201332 (making a similar point). Our modern qualified\nimmunity doctrine protects \u201call but the plainly incompetent or\nthose who knowingly violate the law.\u201dAshcroftv.al-Kidd, 563 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 12)\n(quotingMalleyv.Briggs,475 U.\u00a0S. 335,341\n(1986)). By contrast, Justice Story\u2019s opinion inThe\nFriendship, 9 F.\u00a0Cas. 825, 826 (No. 5,125) (CC Mass. 1812)\n(citedante,at 7), suggests the appropriate standard for\ndeciding when a legal error can support a seizure: when an officer\ntakes a reasonable view of a \u201cvexata questio\u201d on which different\njudges \u201ch[o]ld opposite opinions.\u201d See Brief for United States asAmicus Curiae26 (invoking that language). Or to make the\nsame point without the Latin, the test is satisfied when the law at\nissue is \u201cso doubtful in construction\u201d that a reasonable judge\ncould agree with the officer\u2019s view.The Friendship, 9\nF.\u00a0Cas., at 826.A court tasked with deciding whether an officer\u2019s mistake of law\ncan support a seizure thus faces a straightforward question of\nstatutory construction. If the statute is genuinely ambiguous, such\nthat overturning the officer\u2019s judgment requires hard interpretive\nwork, then the officer has made a reasonable mistake. But if not,\nnot. As the Solicitor General made the point at oral argument, the\nstatute must pose a \u201creally difficult\u201d or \u201cvery hard question of\nstatutory interpretation.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 50. And indeed, both\nNorth Carolina and the Solicitor General agreed that such cases\nwill be \u201cexceedingly rare.\u201d Brief for Respondent 17; Tr. of Oral\nArg. 48.The Court\u2019s analysis of Sergeant Darisse\u2019s interpretation of the\nNorth Carolina law at issue here appropriately reflects these\nprinciples. As the Court explains, seeante, at\n12\u201313,the statute requires every car on the highway to have\n\u201ca stop lamp,\u201d in the singular. N.\u00a0C. Gen. Stat. Ann.\n\u00a720\u2013129(g) (2007). But the statute goes on to state that a stop\nlamp (or, in more modern terminology, brake light) \u201cmay be\nincorporated into a unit with one or moreotherrear lamps,\u201d\nsuggesting that a stop lamp itself qualifies as a rear lamp.Ibid.(emphasis added). And the statute further mandates\nthat every car have \u201calloriginally equipped rear lamps\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. in good working order.\u201d \u00a720\u2013129(d) (emphasis\nadded). The North Carolina Court of Appeals dealt with the\nstatute\u2019s conflicting signals in one way (deciding that a brake\nlight isnota rear lamp, and so only one needs to work);\nbut a court could easily take the officer\u2019s view (deciding that a\nbrake lightisa rear lamp, and if a car comes equipped with\nmore than one, as modern cars do, all must be in working order).\nThe critical point is that the statute poses a quite difficult\nquestion of interpretation, and Sergeant Darisse\u2019s judgment,\nalthough overturned, had much to recommend it. I therefore agree\nwith the Court that the traffic stop he conducted did not violate\nthe Fourth Amendment.Notes1I note in addition, as does the\nCourt, that one kind of mistaken legal judgment\u2014an error about the\ncontours of the Fourth Amendment itself\u2014can never support a search\nor seizure. Seeante,at 10 (\u201cAn officer\u2019s mistaken view\nthat\u201d conduct does \u201cnotgive rise to\u201d a Fourth Amendment\nviolation, \u201cno matter how reasonable,\u201d cannot change a court\u2019s\n\u201cultimate conclusion\u201d that such a violation has occurred). As the\nSolicitor General has explained, mistakes about the requirements of\nthe Fourth Amendment \u201cviolate the Fourth Amendment even when they\nare reasonable.\u201d Brief for United States asAmicus Curiae30, n.\u00a03; see Brief for Respondent 29 (stating the same\nview).",
