Buck\u2019s attorney called a psychologist to offer his opinion\non that issue. The psychologist testified that Buck probably would\nnot engage in violent conduct. But he also stated that one of the\nfactors pertinent in assessing a person\u2019s propensity for violence\nwas his race, and that Buck was statistically more likely to act\nviolently because he is black. The jury sentenced Buck to\ndeath.Buck contends that his attorney\u2019s introduction of this evidence\nviolated his Sixth Amendment right to the effective assistance of\ncounsel. This claim has never been heard on the merits in any\ncourt, because the attorney who represented Buck in his first state\npostconviction proceeding failed to raise it. In 2006, a Federal\nDistrict Court relied on that failure\u2014properly, under\nthen-governing law\u2014to hold that Buck\u2019s claim was procedurally\ndefaulted and unreviewable.In 2014, Buck sought to reopen that 2006 judgment by filing a\nmotion under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(6). He argued\nthat this Court\u2019s decisions inMartinezv.Ryan,566\nU.\u00a0S. 1 (2012), andTrevinov.Thaler, 569\nU.\u00a0S. ___ (2013), had changed the law in a way that provided\nan excuse for his procedural default, permitting him to litigate\nhis claim on the merits. In addition to this change in the law,\nBuck\u2019s motion identified ten other factors that, he said,\nconstituted the \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d required to justify\nreopening the 2006 judgment under the Rule. SeeGonzalezv.Crosby,545 U.\u00a0S. 524,535 (2005).The District Court below denied the motion, and the Fifth\nCircuit declined to issue the certificate of appealability (COA)\nrequested by Buck to appeal that decision. We granted certiorari,\nand now reverse.IAOn the morning of July 30, 1995, Duane Buck arrived at the home\nof his former girlfriend, Debra Gardner. He was carrying a rifle\nand a shotgun. Buck entered the home, shot Phyllis Taylor, his\nstepsister, and then shot Gardner\u2019s friend Kenneth Butler. Gardner\nfled the house, and Buck followed. So did Gardner\u2019s young children.\nWhile Gardner\u2019s son and daughter begged for their mother\u2019s life,\nBuck shot Gardner in the chest. Gardner and Butler died of their\nwounds. Taylor survived.Police officers arrived soon after the shooting and placed Buck\nunder arrest. An officer would later testify that Buck was laughing\nat the scene. He remained \u201chappy\u201d and \u201cupbeat\u201d as he was driven to\nthe police station, \u201c[s]miling and laughing\u201d in the back of the\npatrol car. App. 134a\u2013135a, 252a.Buck was tried for capital murder, and the jury convicted.\nDuring the penalty phase of the trial, the jury was charged with\ndeciding two issues. The first was what the parties term the\n\u201cfuture dangerousness\u201d question. At the time of Buck\u2019s trial, a\nTexas jury could impose the death penalty only if it\nfound\u2014unanimously and beyond a reasonable doubt\u2014\u201ca probability that\nthe defendant would commit criminal acts of violence that would\nconstitute a continuing threat to society.\u201d Tex. Code Crim. Proc.\nAnn., Art. 37.071, \u00a72(b)(1) (Vernon 1998). The second issue, to be\nreached only if the jury found Buck likely to be a future danger,\nwas whether mitigating circumstances nevertheless warranted a\nsentence of life imprisonment instead of death. See \u00a72(e).The parties focused principally on the first question. The State\ncalled witnesses who emphasized the brutality of Buck\u2019s crime and\nhis evident lack of remorse in its aftermath. The State also called\nanother former girlfriend, Vivian Jackson. She testified that,\nduring their relationship, Buck had routinely hit her and had twice\npointed a gun at her. Finally, the State introduced evidence of\nBuck\u2019s criminal history, including convictions for delivery of\ncocaine and unlawfully carrying a weapon. App. 125a\u2013127a, 185a.Defense counsel answered with a series of lay witnesses,\nincluding Buck\u2019s father and stepmother, who testified that they had\nnever known him to be violent. Counsel also called two\npsychologists to testify as experts. The first, Dr. Patrick\nLawrence, observed that Buck had previously served time in prison\nand had been held in minimum custody. From this he concluded that\nBuck \u201cdid not present any problems in the prison setting.\u201d Record\nin No. 4:04\u2013cv\u201303965 (SD Tex.), Doc. 5\u2013116, pp. 12\u201313. Dr. Lawrence\nfurther testified that murders within the Texas penal system tend\nto be gang related (there was no evidence Buck had ever been a\nmember of a gang) and that Buck\u2019s offense had been a \u201ccrime of\npassion\u201d occurring within the context of a romantic relationship.Id.,at 4, 19, 21. Based on these considerations, Dr.\nLawrence determined that Buck was unlikely to be a danger if he\nwere sentenced to life in prison.Id.,at 20\u201321.Buck\u2019s second expert, Dr. Walter Quijano, had been appointed by\nthe presiding judge to conduct a psychological evaluation. Dr.\nQuijano had met with Buck in prison prior to trial and shared a\nreport of his findings with defense counsel.Like Dr. Lawrence, Dr. Quijano thought it significant that\nBuck\u2019s prior acts of violence had arisen from romantic\nrelationships with women; Buck, of course, would not form any such\nrelationships while incarcerated. And Dr. Quijano likewise\nconsidered Buck\u2019s behavioral record in prison a good indicator that\nfuture violence was unlikely. App. 36a, 39a\u201340a.But there was more to the report. In determining whether Buck\nwas likely to pose a danger in the future, Dr. Quijano considered\nseven \u201cstatistical factors.\u201d The fourth factor was \u201crace.\u201d His\nreport read, in relevant part: \u201c4. Race. Black: Increased\nprobability. There is an over-representation of Blacks among the\nviolent offenders.\u201dId.,at 19a.Despite knowing Dr. Quijano\u2019s view that Buck\u2019s race was\ncompetent evidence of an increased probability of future violence,\ndefense counsel called Dr. Quijano to the stand and asked him to\ndiscuss the \u201cstatistical factors\u201d he had \u201clooked at in regard to\nthis case.\u201dId.,at 145a\u2013146a. Dr. Quijano responded that\ncertain factors were \u201cknow[n] to predict future dangerousness\u201d and,\nconsistent with his report, identified race as one of them.Id.,at 146a. \u201cIt\u2019s a sad commentary,\u201d he testified, \u201cthat\nminorities, Hispanics and black people, are over represented in the\nCriminal Justice System.\u201dIbid.Through further questioning,\ncounsel elicited testimony concerning factors Dr. Quijano thought\nfavorable to Buck, as well as his ultimate opinion that Buck was\nunlikely to pose a danger in the future. At the close of Dr.\nQuijano\u2019s testimony, his report was admitted into evidence.Id.,at 150a\u2013152a.After opening cross-examination with a series of general\nquestions, the prosecutor likewise turned to the report. She asked\nfirst about the statistical factors of past crimes and age, then\nquestioned Dr. Quijano about the roles of sex and race: \u201cYou have\ndetermined that the sex factor, that a male is more violent than a\nfemale because that\u2019s just the way it is, and that the race factor,\nblack, increases the future dangerousness for various complicated\nreasons; is that correct?\u201dId.,at 170a. Dr. Quijano\nreplied, \u201cYes.\u201dIbid.During closing arguments, defense counsel emphasized that Buck\nhad proved to be \u201ccontrollable in the prison population,\u201d and that\nhis crime was one of \u201cjealousy, .\u00a0.\u00a0. passion and\nemotion\u201d unlikely to be repeated in jail.Id.,at 189a\u2013191a.\nThe State stressed the crime\u2019s brutal nature and Buck\u2019s lack of\nremorse, along with the inability of Buck\u2019s own experts to\nguarantee that he would not act violently in the future\u2014a point it\nsupported by reference to Dr. Quijano\u2019s testimony. Seeid.,at 198a\u2013199a (\u201cYou heard from Dr. Quijano, .\u00a0.\u00a0. who told\nyou that .\u00a0.\u00a0. the probability did exist that [Buck]\nwould be a continuing threat to society.\u201d).The jury deliberated over the course of two days. During that\ntime it sent out four notes, one of which requested the \u201cpsychology\nreports\u201d that had been admitted into evidence.Id.,at 209a.\nThese reports\u2014including Dr. Quijano\u2019s\u2014were provided. The jury\nreturned a sentence of death.BBuck\u2019s conviction and sentence were affirmed on direct appeal.Buckv.State, No. 72,810 (Tex. Crim. App., Apr. 28,\n1999). His case then entered a labyrinth of state and federal\ncollateral review, where it has wandered for the better part of two\ndecades.Buck filed his first petition for a writ of habeas corpus in\nTexas state court in 1999. The four claims advanced in his\npetition, however, were all frivolous or noncognizable. SeeEx\u00a0parte Buck, No. 699684\u2013A (Dist. Ct. Harris Cty.,\nTex., July 11, 2003), pp.\u00a06\u20137. The petition failed to mention\ndefense counsel\u2019s introduction of expert testimony that Buck\u2019s race\nincreased his propensity for violence.But Dr. Quijano had testified in other cases, too, and in 1999,\nwhile Buck\u2019s first habeas petition was pending, one of those cases\nreached this Court. The petitioner, Victor Hugo Saldano, argued\nthat his death sentence had been tainted by Dr. Quijano\u2019s testimony\nthat Saldano\u2019s Hispanic heritage \u201cwas a factor weighing in the\nfavor of future dangerousness.\u201d App. 302a. Texas confessed error on\nthat ground and asked this Court to grant Saldano\u2019s petition for\ncertiorari, vacate the state court judgment, and remand the case.\nIn June 2000, the Court did so.Saldanov.Texas,530\nU.\u00a0S. 1212.Within days, the Texas Attorney General, John Cornyn, issued a\npublic statement concerning the cases in which Dr. Quijano had\ntestified. The statement affirmed that \u201cit is inappropriate to\nallow race to be considered as a factor in our criminal justice\nsystem.\u201d App. 213a. In keeping with that principle, the Attorney\nGeneral explained that his office had conducted a \u201cthorough audit\u201d\nand \u201cidentified eight more cases in which testimony was offered by\nDr. Quijano that race should be a factor for the jury to consider\nin making its determination about the sentence in a capital murder\ntrial.\u201dIbid.Six of those cases were \u201csimilar to that of\nVictor Hugo Saldano\u201d; in those cases, letters had been sent to\ncounsel apprising them of the Attorney General\u2019s findings.Id.,at 213a\u2013214a. The statement closed by identifying the\ndefendants in those six cases. Buck was one of them.Id.,at\n215a\u2013217a. By the close of 2002, the Attorney General had confessed\nerror, waived any avail-able procedural defenses, and consented to\nresentencing in the cases of five of those six defendants. SeeAlbav.Johnson, 232 F. 3d 208 (CA5 2000) (Table);\nMemorandum and Order inBluev.Johnson, No.\n4:99\u2013cv\u201300350 (SD Tex.), pp. 15\u201317; Order inGarciav.Johnson, No. 1:99\u2013cv\u201300134 (ED Tex.), p. 1; Order inBroxtonv.Johnson, No. 4:00\u2013cv\u201301034 (SD Tex.), pp.\n10\u201311; Final Judgment inGonzalesv.Cockrell, No.\n7:99\u2013cv\u201300072 (WD Tex.), p. 1.Not, however, in Buck\u2019s. In 2002, Buck\u2019s attorney filed a new\nstate habeas petition alleging that trial counsel had rendered\nineffective assistance by introducing Dr. Quijano\u2019s testimony. The\nState was not represented by the Attorney General in this\nproceeding\u2014the Texas Attorney General represents state respondents\nin federal habeas cases, but not state habeas cases\u2014and it did not\nconfess error. Because Buck\u2019s petition was successive, the Texas\nCourt of Criminal Appeals dismissed it as an abuse of the writ.Ex\u00a0parte Buck, Nos. 57,004\u201301, 57,004\u201302 (Tex. Crim.\nApp., Oct. 15, 2003) (per curiam).Buck turned to the federal courts. He filed a petition for\nhabeas corpus under28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72254 in October 2004, by\nwhich time Attorney General Cornyn had left office. SeeBuckv.Dretke, 2006 WL 8411481, *2 (SD Tex., July 24, 2006).\nBuck sought relief on the ground that trial counsel\u2019s introduction\nof Dr. Quijano\u2019s testimony was constitutionally ineffective. The\nState responded that the state court had dismissed Buck\u2019s\nineffective assistance claim because Buck had failed to press it in\nhis first petition, raising it for the first time in a procedurally\nimproper second petition. The State argued that such reliance on an\nestablished state rule of procedure was an adequate and independent\nstate ground precluding federal review. Texas acknowledged that it\nhad waived similar procedural defenses in Saldano\u2019s case. But it\nargued that Buck\u2019s case was different because \u201c[i]n Saldano\u2019s case\nDr. Quijanotestified for the State\u201d; in Buck\u2019s, \u201cit was\nBuck who called Dr. Quijano to testify.\u201d Answer and Motion for\nSummary Judgment in No. 4:04\u2013cv\u201303965 (SD Tex.), p.\u00a020.Buck countered that, notwithstanding his procedural default, the\nDistrict Court should reach the merits of his claim because a\nfailure to do so would result in a miscarriage of justice. Buck did\nnot argue that his default should be excused on a showing of\n\u201ccause\u201d and \u201cprejudice\u201d\u2014that is, cause for the default, and\nprejudice from the denial of a federal right. And for good reason:\nAt the time Buck filed his \u00a72254 petition, our decision inColemanv.Thompson,501 U.\u00a0S. 722\u2013753 (1991),\nmade clear that an attorney\u2019s failure to raise an ineffective\nassistance claim during state postconviction review could not\nconstitute cause. The District Court rejected Buck\u2019s miscarriage of\njustice argument and held that, because of his procedural default,\nhis ineffective assistance claim was unreviewable.Buckv.Dretke, 2006 WL 8411481, at *8. Buck unsuccessfully sought\nreview of the District Court\u2019s ruling. SeeBuckv.Thaler, 345 Fed. Appx. 923 (CA5 2009) (per\ncuriam) (denying application for a COA), cert. denied,559\nU.\u00a0S. 1072 (2010).In 2011, Buck sought to reopen his case, arguing that the\nprosecution had violated the Equal Protection and Due Process\nClauses by asking Dr. Quijano about the relationship between race\nand future violence on cross-examination and referring to his\ntestimony during summation. Buck also argued that the State\u2019s\ndecision to treat him differently from the other defendants\naffected by Dr. Quijano\u2019s testimony justified relieving him of the\nDistrict Court\u2019s adverse judgment. The Fifth Circuit disagreed, seeBuckv.Thaler, 452 Fed. Appx. 423, 427\u2013428 (CA5\n2011) (per curiam), and we denied certiorari,Buckv.Thaler,565 U.\u00a0S. 1022 (2011). Buck,\nstill barred byColemanfrom avoiding the consequences of\nhis procedural default, did not pursue his ineffective assistance\nclaim.CIn 2012, this Court \u201cmodif[ied] the unqualified statement inColemanthat an attorney\u2019s ignorance or inadvertence in a\npostconviction proceeding does not qualify as cause to excuse a\nprocedural default.\u201dMartinez, 566 U.\u00a0S., at 9. We held\nthat when a state formally limits the adjudication of claims of\nineffective assistance of trial counsel to collateral review, a\nprisoner may establish cause for procedural default if (1) \u201cthe\nstate courts did not appoint counsel in the initial-review\ncollateral proceeding,\u201d or \u201cappointed counsel in [that] proceeding\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. was ineffective under the standards ofStricklandv.Washington,466 U.\u00a0S. 668 (1984)\u201d;\nand (2) \u201cthe underlying .\u00a0.\u00a0. claim is a substantial one,\nwhich is to say that .\u00a0.\u00a0. the claim has some merit.\u201dId.,at 14.By its terms,Martinezdid not bear on Buck\u2019s ineffective\nassistance claim. At the time of Buck\u2019s conviction and appeal,\nTexas did not formally require criminal defendants to reserve such\nclaims for collateral review. InTre-vino, however, the\nCourt concluded that the exception an-nounced inMartinezextended to state systems that, as a practical matter, deny\ncriminal defendants \u201ca meaningful opportunity\u201d to press ineffective\nassistance claims on direct appeal. 569 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 13). The Court further concluded that the system in Texas,\nwhere petitioner had been convicted, was such a system.Ibid.The upshot: HadMartinezandTrevinobeen decided before Buck filed his \u00a72254 petition, a federal court\ncould have reviewed Buck\u2019s ineffective assistance claim if he\ndemonstrated that (1) state postconviction counsel had been\nconstitutionally ineffective in failing to raise it, and (2) the\nclaim had \u201csome merit.\u201dMartinez, 566 U.\u00a0S., at 14.DWhenTrevinowas decided, Buck\u2019s third state habeas\npetition was pending in Texas court. That petition was denied in\nNovember 2013.Ex\u00a0parte Buck, 418 S.\u00a0W. 3d 98\n(Tex. Crim. App. 2013) (per curiam). Two months later,\nBuck returned to federal court, where he filed a motion to reopen\nhis \u00a72254 case under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(6). Rule\n60(b) enumerates specific circumstances in which a party may be\nrelieved of the effect of a judgment, such as mistake, newly\ndiscovered evidence, fraud, and the like. The Rule concludes with a\ncatchall category\u2014subdivision (b)(6)\u2014providing that a court may\nlift a judgment for \u201cany other reason that justifies relief.\u201d\nRelief is available under subdivision (b)(6), however, only in\n\u201cextraordinary circumstances,\u201d and the Court has explained that\n\u201c[s]uch circumstances will rarely occur in the habeas context.\u201dGonzalez, 545 U.\u00a0S., at 535.In his motion, Buck identified 11 factors that, in his view,\njustified reopening the judgment. These included his attorney\u2019s\nintroduction of expert testimony linking Buck\u2019s race to violence,\nthe central issue at sentencing; the prosecution\u2019s questions about\nrace and violence on cross-examination and reliance on Dr.\nQuijano\u2019s testimony in summation; the State\u2019s confession of error\nin other cases in which Dr. Quijano testified, but its refusal to\nconcede error in Buck\u2019s case; and the change in law effected byMartinezandTrevino, which, if they had been decided\nearlier, would have permitted federal review of Buck\u2019s defaulted\nclaim. App. 283a\u2013285a.The District Court denied relief on two grounds. First, the\ncourt concluded that Buck had failed to demonstrate extraordinary\ncircumstances. To that end, the court observed that a change in\ndecisional law is rarely extraordinary by itself.Buckv.Stephens, 2014 WL 11310152, *4 (SD Tex., Aug. 29, 2014). It\nfurther determined that the State\u2019s \u201cpromise\u201d not to oppose\nresentencing did not count for much, reasoning that \u201cBuck\u2019s case is\ndifferent in critical respects from the cases in which Texas\nconfessed error\u201d in that Buck\u2019s lawyer, not the prosecutor, had\nfirst elicited the objectionable testimony.Id.,at *4\u2013*5.\nThe court also dismissed the contention that the nature of Dr.\nQuijano\u2019s testimony argued for reopening the case. Although \u201cthe\nintroduction of any mention of race was,\u201d in the court\u2019s view,\n\u201cill[ ]advised at best and repugnant at worst,\u201d it was also \u201cde\nminimis\u201d: Dr. Quijano had discussed the connection between race\nand violence only twice.Id.,at *5. The court accordingly\nconcluded that Buck had failed to make out the predicate for Rule\n60(b)(6) relief.Second, the court determined that\u2014even if the circumstanceswereextraordinary\u2014Buck\u2019s claim would fail on the merits.\nThe court noted that underStrickland, Buck was obliged to\nshow that counsel\u2019s performance was both deficient and prejudicial.\nThe court held that Buck\u2019s lawyer had indeed performed deficiently\nin calling Dr. Quijano to give testimony that \u201clen[t] credence to\nany potential latent racial prejudice held by the jury.\u201d 2014 WL\n11310152, at *6. But, the court concluded, Buck had failed to\ndemonstrate prejudice. It observed that Buck\u2019s crime had been\n\u201chorrific.\u201dIbid.And the court had already concluded that\n\u201cthe introduction of any mention of race was .\u00a0.\u00a0.de\nminimis.\u201dId.,at *5. For those reasons, it held, Buck\nhad failed to show a reasonable probability that he would not have\nbeen sentenced to death but for Dr. Quijano\u2019s testimony about race\nand violence.Buck sought to appeal the denial of his Rule 60(b)(6) motion. He\naccordingly filed an application for a COA with the Fifth Circuit.\nTo obtain a COA, Buck was required to make \u201ca substantial showing\nof the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d[1]*28\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72253(c)(2).The Fifth Circuit denied a COA, concluding that Buck\u2019s case was\n\u201cnot extraordinary at all in the habeas context.\u201dBuckv.Stephens, 623 Fed. Appx. 668, 673 (2015). The panel agreed\nwith the District Court thatMartinezandTrevinowere not significant factors in the analysis. It characterized most\nof the other factors Buck had identified as \u201cvariations on the\nmerits\u201d of his claim, which was \u201cat least unremarkable as far as\n[ineffective assistance] claims go.\u201d 623 Fed. Appx., at 673. The\npanel likewise rejected Buck\u2019s argument that he was entitled to\nrelief because the State had issued a press release indicating that\nhis case would be treated like Saldano\u2019s, and then had confessed\nerror in the other cases identified as similar in the statement,\nbut not in Buck\u2019s.Id.,at 674. Because Buck had \u201cnot shown\nextraordinary circumstances that would permit relief under Federal\nRule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(6),\u201d the panel \u201cden[ied] the\napplication for a COA.\u201dId.,at 669.Buck\u2019s motion for rehearing en banc was denied over two\ndissenting votes.Buckv.Stephens, 630 Fed. Appx.\n251 (CA5 2015) (per curiam). We granted certiorari.Buckv.Stephens, 578 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2016).IIA state prisoner whose petition for a writ of habeas corpus is\ndenied by a federal district court does not enjoy an absolute right\nto appeal. Federal law requires that he first obtain a COA from a\ncircuit justice or judge.28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72253(c)(1). A COA\nmay issue \u201conly if the applicant has made a substantial showing of\nthe denial of a constitutional right.\u201d \u00a72253(c)(2). Until the\nprisoner secures a COA, the Court of Appeals may not rule on the\nmerits of his case.Miller-Elv.Cockrell,537\nU.\u00a0S. 322 (2003).The COA inquiry, we have emphasized, is not coextensive with a\nmerits analysis. At the COA stage, the only question is whether the\napplicant has shown that \u201cjurists of reason could disagree with the\ndistrict court\u2019s resolution of his constitutional claims or that\njurists could conclude the issues presented are adequate to deserve\nencouragement to proceed further.\u201dId.,at 327. This\nthreshold question should be decided without \u201cfull consideration of\nthe factual or legal bases adduced in support of the claims.\u201dId.,at 336. \u201cWhen a court of appeals sidesteps [the COA]\nprocess by first deciding the merits of an appeal, and then\njustifying its denial of a COA based on its adjudication of the\nactual merits, it is in essence deciding an appeal without\njurisdiction.\u201dId.,at 336\u2013337.The court below phrased its determination in proper terms\u2014that\njurists of reason would not debate that Buck should be denied\nrelief, 623 Fed. Appx., at 674\u2014but it reached that conclusion only\nafter essentially deciding the case on the merits. As the court put\nit in the second sentence of its opinion: \u201cBecause [Buck] has not\nshown extraordinary circumstances that would permit relief under\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(6), we deny the application\nfor a COA.\u201dId.,at 669. The balance of the Fifth Circuit\u2019s\nopinion reflects the same approach. The change in law effected byMartinezandTrevino, the panel wrote, was \u201cnot an\nextraordinary circumstance.\u201d 623 Fed. Appx., at 674. Even if Texas\ninitially indicated to Buck that he would be resentenced, its\n\u201cdecision not to follow through\u201d was \u201cnot extraordinary.\u201dIbid.Buck \u201cha[d] not shown why\u201d the State\u2019s alleged broken\npromise \u201cwould justify relief from the judgment.\u201dIbid.But the question for the Fifth Circuit was not whether Buck had\n\u201cshown extraordinary circumstances\u201d or \u201cshown why [Texas\u2019s broken\npromise] would justify relief from the judgment.\u201dId.,at\n669, 674. Those are ultimate merits determinations the panel should\nnot have reached. We reiterate what we have said before: A \u201ccourt\nof appeals should limit its examination [at the COA stage] to a\nthreshold inquiry into the underlying merit of [the] claims,\u201d and\nask \u201conly if the District Court\u2019s decision was debatable.\u201dMiller-El, 537 U.\u00a0S., at 327, 348.The dissent does not accept this established rule, arguing that\na reviewing court that deems a claim nondebatable \u201cmust necessarily\nconclude that the claim is meritless.\u201dPost, at 2 (opinion\nof Thomas, J.). Of course when a court of appeals properly applies\nthe COA standard and determines that a prisoner\u2019s claim is not even\ndebatable, that necessarily means the prisoner has failed to show\nthat his claim is meritorious. But the converse is not true. That a\nprisoner has failed to make the ultimate showing that his claim is\nmeritorious does not logically mean he failed to make a preliminary\nshowing that his claim was debatable. Thus, when a reviewing court\n(like the Fifth Circuit here) inverts the statutory order of\noperations and \u201cfirst decid[es] the merits of an appeal,\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. then justif[ies] its denial of a COA based on its\nadjudication of the actual merits,\u201d it has placed too heavy a\nburden on the prisonerat the COA stage.Miller-El,\n537 U.\u00a0S., at 336\u2013337.Miller-Elflatly prohibits such\na departure from the procedure prescribed by \u00a72253.Ibid.The State defends the Fifth Circuit\u2019s approach by arguing that\nthe court\u2019s consideration of an application for a COA is often\nquite thorough. The court \u201coccasionally hears oral argument when\nconsidering whether to grant a COA in a capital case.\u201d Brief for\nRespondent 50. Indeed, in one recent case, it \u201creceived nearly 200\npages of initial briefing, permitted a reply brief, considered the\nparties\u2019 supplemental authorities, invited supplemental letter\nbriefs from both sides, and heard oral argument before denying the\nrequest for a COA.\u201dId.,at 50\u201351.But this hurts rather than helps the State\u2019s case. \u201c[A] claim\ncan be debatable even though every jurist of reason might agree,\nafter the COA has been granted and the case has received full\nconsideration, that petitioner will not prevail.\u201dMiller-El,\n537 U.\u00a0S., at 338. The statute sets forth a two-step process:\nan initial determination whether a claim is reasonably debatable,\nand then\u2014if it is\u2014an appeal in the normal course. We do not mean to\nspecify what procedures may be appropriate in every case. But\nwhatever procedures are employed at the COA stage should be\nconsonant with the limited nature of the inquiry.Given the approach of the court below, it is perhaps\nunderstandable that the parties have essentially briefed and argued\nthe underlying merits at length. See,e.g.,Brief for\nPetitioner 32 (\u201c[T]rial counsel rendered deficient performance\nunderStrickland.\u201d);id.,at 39 (\u201c[T]here is a\nreasonable probability that Dr. Quijano\u2019s race-as-dangerousness\nopinion swayed the judgment of jurors in favor of death.\u201d (internal\nquotation marks and alteration omitted));id.,at 59 (Buck\n\u201chas demonstrated his entitlement to relief under Rule 60(b)(6)\u201d);\nBrief for Respondent 40 (\u201cThe particular facts of petitioner\u2019s case\ndo not establish extraordinary circumstances justifying relief from\nthe judgment.\u201d (boldface type deleted)). With respect to this\nCourt\u2019s review, \u00a72253 does not limit the scope of our consideration\nof the underlying merits, and at this juncture we think it proper\nto meet the decision below and the arguments of the parties on\ntheir own terms.IIIBuck\u2019s request for a COA raised two separate questions for the\nFifth Circuit, one substantive and one procedural: first, whether\nreasonable jurists could debate the District Court\u2019s conclusion\nthat Buck was not denied his right to effective assistance of\ncounsel underStrickland; and second, whether reasonable\njurists could debate the District Court\u2019s procedural holding that\nBuck had not made the necessary showing to reopen his case under\nRule 60(b)(6).AWe begin with the District Court\u2019s determination (not\nspecifically addressed by the Fifth Circuit) that Buck\u2019s\nconstitutional claim failed on the merits. The Sixth Amendment\nright to counsel \u201cis the right to the effective assistance of\ncounsel.\u201dStrickland, 466 U.\u00a0S., at 686 (quotingMcMannv.Richardson,397 U.\u00a0S. 759, n.\u00a014\n(1970)). A defendant who claims to have been denied ef-fective\nassistance must show both that counsel performed deficiently and\nthat counsel\u2019s deficient performance caused him prejudice. 466\nU.\u00a0S., at 687.1Strickland\u2019s first prong sets a high bar. A defense\nlawyer navigating a criminal proceeding faces any number of choices\nabout how best to make a client\u2019s case. The lawyer has discharged\nhis constitutional responsibility so long as his decisions fall\nwithin the \u201cwide range of professionally competent assistance.\u201dId.,at 690. It is only when the lawyer\u2019s errors were \u201cso\nserious that counsel was not functioning as the \u2018counsel\u2019\nguaranteed .\u00a0.\u00a0. by the Sixth Amendment\u201d thatStrickland\u2019s first prong is satisfied.Id.,at\n687.The District Court determined that, in this case, counsel\u2019s\nperformance fell outside the bounds of competent representation. We\nagree. Counsel knew that Dr. Quijano\u2019s report reflected the view\nthat Buck\u2019s race disproportionately predisposed him to violent\nconduct; he also knew that the principal point of dispute during\nthe trial\u2019s penalty phase was whether Buck was likely to act\nviolently in the future. Counsel nevertheless (1) called Dr.\nQuijano to the stand; (2) specifically elicited testimony about the\nconnection between Buck\u2019s race and the likelihood of future\nviolence; and (3) put into evidence Dr. Quijano\u2019s expert report\nthat stated, in reference to factors bearing on future\ndangerousness, \u201cRace. Black: Increased probability.\u201d App. 19a,\n145a\u2013146a.Given that the jury had to make a finding of future\ndangerousness before it could impose a death sentence, Dr.\nQuijano\u2019s report said, in effect, that the color of Buck\u2019s skin\nmade him more deserving of execution. It would be patently\nunconstitutional for a state to argue that a defendant is liable to\nbe a future danger because of his race. SeeZantv.Stephens,462 U.\u00a0S. 862,885 (1983) (identifying race\namong factors that are \u201cconstitutionally impermissible or totally\nirrelevant to the sentencing process\u201d). No competent defense\nattorney would introduce such evidence about his own client. SeeBuckv.Thaler, 565 U.\u00a0S., at 1022 (statement of\nAlito, J., joined by Scalia and Breyer, JJ., respecting denial of\ncertiorari) (Buck\u2019s case \u201cconcerns bizarre and objectionable\ntestimony\u201d).2To satisfyStrickland, a litigant must also demonstrate\nprejudice\u2014\u201ca reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s\nunprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been\ndifferent.\u201d 466 U.\u00a0S.,at 694. Accordingly, the\nquestion before the District Court was whether Buck had\ndemonstrated a reasonable probability that, without Dr. Quijano\u2019s\ntestimony on race, at least one juror would have harbored a\nreasonable doubt about whether Buck was likely to be violent in the\nfuture. The District Court concluded that Buck had not made such a\nshowing. We disagree.In arguing that the jury would have imposed a death sentence\neven if Dr. Quijano had not offered race-based testimony, the State\nprimarily emphasizes the brutality of Buck\u2019s crime and his lack of\nremorse. A jury may conclude that a crime\u2019s vicious nature calls\nfor a sentence of death. SeeWongv.Belmontes,558\nU.\u00a0S. 15 (2009) (per curiam). In this case,\nhowever, several considerations convince us that it is reasonably\nprobable\u2014notwithstanding the nature of Buck\u2019s crime and his\nbehavior in its aftermath\u2014that the proceeding would have ended\ndifferently had counsel rendered competent representation.Dr. Quijano testified on the key point at issue in Buck\u2019s\nsentencing. True, the jury was asked to decide two issues\u2014whether\nBuck was likely to be a future danger, and, if so, whether\nmitigating circumstances nevertheless justified a sentence of life\nimprisonment. But the focus of the proceeding was on the first\nquestion. Much of the penalty phase testimony was directed to\nfuture dangerousness, as were the summations for both sides. The\njury, consistent with the focus of the parties, asked during\ndeliberations to see the expert reports on dangerousness. See App.\n187a\u2013196a, 198a\u2013203a, 209a.Deciding the key issue of Buck\u2019s dangerousness involved an\nunusual inquiry. The jurors were not asked to determine a\nhistorical fact concerning Buck\u2019s conduct, but to render a\npredictive judgment inevitably entailing a degree of speculation.\nBuck, all agreed, had committed acts of terrible violence. Would he\ndo so again?Buck\u2019s prior violent acts had occurred outside of prison, and\nwithin the context of romantic relationships with women. If the\njury did not impose a death sentence, Buck would be sentenced to\nlife in prison, and no such romantic relationship would be likely\nto arise. A jury could conclude that those changes would minimize\nthe prospect of future dangerousness.But one thing would never change: the color of Buck\u2019s skin. Buck\nwould always be black. And according to Dr. Quijano, that immutable\ncharacteristic carried with it an \u201c[i]ncreased probability\u201d of\nfuture violence.Id.,at 19a. Here was hard statistical\nevidence\u2014from an expert\u2014to guide an otherwise speculative\ninquiry.And it was potent evidence. Dr. Quijano\u2019s testimony appealed to\na powerful racial stereotype\u2014that of black men as \u201cviolence prone.\u201dTurnerv.Murray,476 U.\u00a0S. 28,35 (1986)\n(plurality opinion). In combination with the substance of the\njury\u2019s inquiry, this created something of a perfect storm. Dr.\nQuijano\u2019s opinion coincided precisely with a particularly noxious\nstrain of racial prejudice, which itself coincided precisely with\nthe central question at sentencing. The effect of this unusual\nconfluence of factors was to provide support for making a decision\non life or death on the basis of race.This effect was heightened due to the source of the testimony.\nDr. Quijano took the stand as a medical expert bearing the court\u2019s\nimprimatur. The jury learned at the outset of his testimony that he\nheld a doctorate in clinical psychology, had conducted evaluations\nin some 70 capital murder cases, and had been appointed by the\ntrial judge (at public expense) to evaluate Buck. App. 138a\u2013141a.\nReasonable jurors might well have valued his opinion concerning the\ncentral question before them. SeeSatterwhitev.Texas,486 U.\u00a0S. 249,259 (1988) (testimony from \u201ca\nmedical doctor specializing in psychiatry\u201d on the question of\nfuture dangerousness may have influenced the sentencing jury).For these reasons, we cannot accept the District Court\u2019s\nconclusion that \u201cthe introduction of any mention of race\u201d during\nthe penalty phase was \u201cde minimis.\u201d 2014 WL 11310152, at *5.\nThere were only \u201ctwo references to race in Dr. Quijano\u2019s\ntestimony\u201d\u2014one during direct examination, the other on cross.Ibid.But when a jury hears expert testimony that expressly\nmakes a defendant\u2019s race directly pertinent on the question of life\nor death, the impact of that evidence cannot be measured simply by\nhow much air time it received at trial or how many pages it\noccupies in the record. Some toxins can be deadly in small\ndoses.The State acknowledges, as it must, that introducing \u201crace or\nethnicity as evidence of criminality\u201d can in some cases prejudice a\ndefendant. Brief for Respondent 31. But it insists that this is not\nsuch a case, because Buck\u2019s own counsel, not the prosecution,\nelicited the offending testimony. We are not convinced. In fact,\nthe distinction could well cut the other way. A prosecutor is\nseeking a conviction. Jurors understand this and may reasonably be\nexpected to evaluate the government\u2019s evidence and arguments in\nlight of its motivations. When a defendant\u2019s own lawyer puts in the\noffending evidence, it is in the nature of an admission against\ninterest, more likely to be taken at face value.The effect of Dr. Quijano\u2019s testimony on Buck\u2019s sentencing\ncannot be dismissed as \u201cde minimis.\u201d Buck has demonstrated\nprejudice.B1We now turn to the lower courts\u2019 procedural holding: that Buck\nfailed to demonstrate that he was entitled to have the judgment\nagainst him reopened under Rule 60(b)(6). We have held that a\nlitigant seeking a COA must demonstrate that a procedural ruling\nbarring relief is itself debatable among jurists of reason;\notherwise, the appeal would not \u201cdeserve encouragement to proceed\nfurther.\u201dSlackv.McDaniel,529 U.\u00a0S. 473,484\n(2000) (quotingBarefootv.Estelle, 463 U.\u00a0S.\n880, n.\u00a04 (1983)).The Rule 60(b)(6) holding Buck challenges would be reviewed for\nabuse of discretion during a merits appeal, see 11 C. Wright, A.\nMiller, & M. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a72857 (3d ed.\n2012), and the parties agree that the COA question is therefore\nwhether a reasonable jurist could conclude that the District Court\nabused its discretion in declining to reopen the judgment. See\nBrief for Petitioner 54\u201357; Brief for Respondent 34.Buck brought his Rule 60(b) motion under the Rule\u2019s catchall\ncategory, subdivision (b)(6), which permits a court to reopen a\njudgment for \u201cany other reason that justifies relief.\u201d Rule 60(b)\nvests wide discretion in courts, but we have held that relief under\nRule 60(b)(6) is available only in \u201cextraordinary circumstances.\u201dGonzalez, 545 U.\u00a0S., at 535. In determining whether\nextraordinary circumstances are present, a court may consider a\nwide range of factors. These may include, in an appropriate case,\n\u201cthe risk of injustice to the parties\u201d and \u201cthe risk of undermining\nthe public\u2019s confidence in the judicial process.\u201dLiljebergv.Health Services Acquisition Corp.,486 U.\u00a0S. 847\u2013864\n(1988).In the circumstances of this case, the District Court abused its\ndiscretion in denying Buck\u2019s Rule 60(b)(6) motion. The District\nCourt\u2019s conclusion that Buck \u201cha[d] failed to demonstrate that this\ncase presents extraordinary circumstances\u201d rested in large measure\non itsdetermination that \u201cthe introduction of any mention of\nrace\u201d\u2014though \u201cill[\u00a0]advised at best and repugnant at\nworst\u201d\u2014played only a \u201cde minimis\u201d role in the proceeding.\n2014 WL 11310152, at *5. The Fifth Circuit, for its part, failed\neven to mention the racial evidence in concludingthat Buck\u2019s claim\nwas \u201cat least unremarkable as far as [ineffective assistance]\nclaims go.\u201d 623 Fed. Appx., at 673. But our holding on prejudice\nmakes clear that Buck may have been sentenced to death in part\nbecause of his race. As an initial matter, this is a disturbing\ndeparture from a basic premise of our criminal justice system: Our\nlaw punishes people for what they do, not who they are. Dispensing\npunishment on the basis of an immutable characteristic flatly\ncontravenes this guiding principle. As petitioner correctly puts\nit, \u201c[i]t stretches credulity to characterize Mr. Buck\u2019s\n[ineffective assistance of counsel] claim as run-of-the-mill.\u201d\nBrief for Petitioner 57.This departure from basic principle was exacerbated because it\nconcerned race. \u201cDiscrimination on the basis of race, odious in all\naspects, is especially pernicious in the administration of\njustice.\u201dRosev.Mitchell,443 U.\u00a0S. 545,555\n(1979). Relying on race to impose a criminal sanction \u201cpoisons\npublic confidence\u201d in the judicial process.Davisv.Ayala, 576 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2015) (slip op., at 28). It\nthus injures not just the defendant, but \u201cthe law as an\ninstitution, .\u00a0.\u00a0. the community at large, and\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. the democratic ideal reflected in the processes of\nour courts.\u201dRose, 443 U.\u00a0S., at 556 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). Such concerns are precisely among those\nwe have identified as supporting relief under Rule 60(b)(6). SeeLiljeberg, 486 U.\u00a0S.,at 864.The extraordinary nature of this case is confirmed by what the\nState itself did in response to Dr. Quijano\u2019s testimony. When the\ncase of Victor Hugo Saldano came before this Court, Texas confessed\nerror and consented to resentencing. The State\u2019s response to\nSaldano\u2019s petition for certiorari succinctly expressed the\ninjustice Saldano had suffered: \u201cthe infusion of race as a factor\nfor the jury to weigh in making its determination violated his\nconstitutional right to be sentenced without regard to the color of\nhis skin.\u201d App. 306a.The Attorney General\u2019s public statement, issued shortly after we\nvacated the judgment in Saldano\u2019s case, reflected this sentiment.\nIt explained that the State had responded to Saldano\u2019s troubling\npetition by conducting a \u201cthorough audit\u201d of criminal cases,\nfinding six similar to Saldano\u2019s \u201cin which testimony was offered by\nDr. Quijano that race should be a factor for the jury to consider.\u201dId.,at 213a. The statement affirmed that \u201cit is\ninappropriate to allow race to be considered as a factor in our\ncriminal justice system.\u201dIbid. Consistent with this\nposition\u2014and to its credit\u2014the State confessed error in the cases\nof five of the six defendants identified in the Attorney General\u2019s\nstatement, waiving all available procedural defenses and consenting\nto resentencing.These were remarkable steps. It is not every day that a State\nseeks to vacate the sentences of five defendants found guilty of\ncapital murder. But then again, these were\u2014as the State itself put\nit at oral argument here\u2014\u201cextraordinary\u201d cases. Tr. of Oral Arg.\n41; seeBuckv.Thaler, 565 U.\u00a0S., at 1030\n(Sotomayor, J., joined by Kagan, J., dissenting from denial of\ncertiorari) (\u201cEspecially in light of the capital nature of this\ncase and the express recognition by a Texas attorney general that\nthe relevant testimony was inappropriately race charged, Buck has\npresented issues that \u2018deserve encouragement to proceed\nfurther.\u2019\u00a0\u201d (quotingMiller-El, 537 U.\u00a0S., at\n327)).To be sure, the State has repeatedly attempted to justify its\ndecision to treat Buck differently from the other five defendants\nidentified in the Attorney General\u2019s statement, including on\nasserted factual grounds that the State has been required to\nabjure. See Brief for Respondent 46, n.\u00a010 (the State\u2019s\ninitial opposition to Buck\u2019s habeas petition \u201cerroneously\u201d argued\nthat Buck was treated differently because defense counsel, not the\nState, called Dr. Quijano as a witness; that was also true of two\nof the other defendants). The State continues its efforts before\nthis Court, arguing that Buck\u2019s was the only one of the six cases\nin which defense counsel, not the prosecution, first elicited Dr.\nQuijano\u2019s opinion on race. See alsopost, at 8 (opinion of\nThomas, J.).But this is beside the point. The State\u2019s various explanations\nfor distinguishing Buck\u2019s case have nothing to do with the Attorney\nGeneral\u2019s stated reasons for confessing error inSaldanoand\nthe cases acknowledged as similar. Regardless of which party first\nbroached the subject, race was in all these cases put to the jury\n\u201cas a factor .\u00a0.\u00a0. to weigh in making its determination.\u201d\nApp. 306a. The statement that \u201cit is inappropriate to allow race to\nbe considered as a factor in our criminal justice system\u201d is\nequally applicable whether the prosecution or ineffective defense\ncounsel initially injected race into the proceeding.Id.,at\n213a. The terms of the State\u2019s announcement provide every reason\nfor originally including Buck on the list of defendants situated\nsimilarly to Saldano, and no reason for later taking him off.In opposition, the State reminds us of the importance of\npreserving the finality of judgments. Brief for Respondent 34. But\nthe \u201cwhole purpose\u201d of Rule 60(b) \u201cis to make an exception to\nfinality.\u201dGonzalez, 545 U.\u00a0S., at 529. And in this\ncase, the State\u2019s interest in finality deserves little weight. When\nTexas recognized that the infusion of race into proceedings similar\nto Saldano\u2019s warranted confession of error, it effectively\nacknowledged that the people of Texas lack an interest in enforcing\na capital sentence obtained on so flawed a basis. In concluding\nthat the value of finality does not demand that we leave the\nDistrict Court\u2019s judgment in place, we do no more than acknowledge\nwhat Texas itself recognized 17 years ago.2Our Rule 60(b)(6) analysis has thus far omitted one significant\nelement. When Buck first sought federal ha-beas relief in 2004,Colemanbarred the District Court from hearing his claim.\nToday, however, a claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel\ndefaulted in a Texas postconviction proceeding may be reviewed in\nfederal court if state habeas counsel was constitutionally\nineffective in failing to raise it, and the claim has \u201csome merit.\u201dMartinez, 566 U.\u00a0S., at 14; seeTrevino, 569\nU.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 13). Buck cannot obtain relief\nunless he is entitled to the benefit of this rule\u2014that is, unlessMartinezandTrevino, notColeman, would\ngovern his case were it reopened. If they would not, his claim\nwould remain unreviewable, and Rule 60(b)(6) relief would be\ninappropriate. See 11 Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and\nProcedure \u00a72857 (showing \u201ca good claim or defense\u201d is a\nprecondition of Rule 60(b)(6) relief\u00a0).Until merits briefing in this Court, both parties litigated this\nmatter on the assumption thatMartinezandTrevinowould apply if Buck reopened his case. See Pet. for Cert. 27\u201328;\nBrief in Opposition 11\u201313; Amended Application for Certificate of\nAppealability and Brief in Support 26, Respondent-Appellee\u2019s\nOpposition to Pet. for En Banc Rehearing 9\u201311, and Respondent\u2019s\nOpposition to Application for Certificate of Appealability 15\u201317 in\nNo. 14\u201370030 (CA5); Amended Response to Motion for Relief from\nJudgment in No. 4:04\u2013cv\u201303965 (SD Tex.), pp. 11\u201313. But the State\u2019s\nbrief adopts a new position on this issue. The State now argues\nthat those cases announced a \u201cnew rule\u201d that, underTeaguev.Lane,489 U.\u00a0S. 288 (1989) (plurality opinion), does\nnot apply retroactively to cases (like Buck\u2019s) on collateral\nreview. Brief for Respondent 38\u201340. Buck responds thatTeagueanalysis applies only to new rules of criminal\nprocedure that govern trial proceedings\u2014not new rules of habeas\nprocedure that govern collateral proceedings\u2014and that the State has\nin any event waived itsTeagueargument. Reply Brief 20.We agree that the argument has been waived. SeeDanforthv.Minnesota,552 U.\u00a0S. 264,289 (2008) (\u201cStates can\nwaive aTeaguedefense .\u00a0.\u00a0. by failing to raise\nit in a timely manner\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d). It was not\nadvanced in District Court, before the Fifth Circuit, or in the\nState\u2019s brief in opposition to Buck\u2019s petition for certiorari.\nAlthough we may reach the issue in our discretion, we have observed\nbefore that a State\u2019s failure to raise aTeagueargument at\nthe petition stage is particularly \u201csignificant\u201d in deciding\nwhether such an exercise of discretion is appropriate.Schirov.Farley,510 U.\u00a0S. 222\u2013229 (1994). When\n\u201ca legal issue appears to warrant review, we grant certiorari in\nthe expectation of being able to decide that issue.\u201dId.,at\n229. If we were to entertain the State\u2019s eleventh-hourTeagueargument and find it persuasive, Buck\u2019sStricklandand Rule 60(b)(6) contentions\u2014the issues we\nthought worthy of review\u2014would be insulated from our consideration.\nWe therefore decline to reach theTeaguequestion and\nconclude thatMartinezandTrevinoapply to Buck\u2019s\nclaim. We reach no broader determination concerning the application\nof these cases.CFor the foregoing reasons, we conclude that Buck has\ndemonstrated both ineffective assistance of counsel underStricklandand an entitlement to relief under Rule 60(b)(6).\nIt follows that the Fifth Circuit erred in denying Buck the COA\nrequired to pursue these claims on appeal.The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth\nCircuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.Notes1*\u00a0The Federal Courts of Appeals appear\nto disagree over whether a COA is needed to appeal the denial of a\nRule 60(b) motion. See Gonzalez v. Crosby,545 U.\u00a0S. 524, and\nn.\u00a07 (2005). In keeping with the approach adopted by the Fifth\nCircuit below and by the parties in their briefs, we assume without\ndeciding that a COA is required here.",
