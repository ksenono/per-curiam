This does not\nmean that a plaintiff may obtain all forms of relief that are\ngenerally available for a violation of \u00a7633a(a), including hiring,\nreinstatement, backpay, and compensatory damages, without showing\nthat a personnel action would have been different if age had not\nbeen taken into account. To obtain such relief, a plaintiff must\nshow that age was a but-for cause of the challenged employment\ndecision. But if age discrimination played a lesser part in the\ndecision, other remedies may be appropriate.INoris Babb, who was born in 1960, is a\nclinical pharmacist at the U.\u00a0S. Department of Veterans\nAffairs Medical Center in Bay Pines, Florida. Babb brought suit in\n2014 against the Secretary of Veterans Affairs (hereinafter VA),\nclaiming that she had been subjected to age and sex discrimination,\nas well as retaliation for engaging in activities protected by\nfederal anti-discrimination law. Only her age-discrimination claims\nare now before us.Those claims center on the following personnel\nactions. First, in 2013, the VA took away Babb\u2019s \u201cadvanced scope\u201d\ndesignation, which had made her eligible for promotion on the\nFederal Government\u2019s General Scale from a GS\u201312 to a\nGS\u201313.[2] Second, during this\nsame time period, she was denied training opportunities and was\npassed over for positions in the hospital\u2019s anticoagulation clinic.\nThird, in 2014, she was placed in a new position, and while her\ngrade was raised to GS\u201313, her holiday pay was reduced. All these\nactions, she maintains, involved age discrimination, and in support\nof her claims, she alleges, among other things, that supervisors\nmade a variety of age-related comments.The VA moved for summary judgment and offered\nnon-discriminatory reasons for the challenged actions, and the\nDistrict Court granted that motion. Evaluating each of Babb\u2019s\nclaims under the burden-shifting framework outlined inMcDonnell\nDouglas Corp.v.Green,411 U.S.\n792(1973), the court found that Babb had established a prima\nfacie case, that the Secretary had proffered legitimate reasons for\nthe challenged actions, and that no jury could reasonably conclude\nthat those reasons were pretextual.Babb appealed, contending that the District\nCourt should not have used theMcDonnell Douglasframework\nbecause it is not suited for \u201cmixed motives\u201d claims. She argued\nthat under the terms of the ADEA\u2019s federal-sector provision, a\npersonnel action is unlawful if age is a factor in the challenged\ndecision. As a result, she explained that even if the VA\u2019s\nproffered reasons were not pretextual, it would not necessarily\nfollow that age discrimination played no part.The Eleventh Circuit panel that heard Babb\u2019s\nappeal found that her argument was \u201cforeclosed\u201d by Circuit\nprecedent but added that it might have agreed with her if it were\n\u201cwriting on a clean slate.\u201dBabbv.Secretary,Dept. of Veterans Affairs, 743 Fed. Appx. 280, 287 (2018)\n(citingTraskv.Secretary,Dept. of Veterans\nAffairs, 822 F.3d 1179 (CA11 2016)).We granted certiorari, 588 U.\u00a0S. ___\n(2019), to resolve a Circuit split over the interpretation of\n\u00a7633a(a).IIThat provision of the ADEA states in relevant\npart: \u201cAll personnel actions affecting employees or applicants for\nemployment who are at least 40 years of age .\u00a0.\u00a0. shall\nbe made free from any discrimination based on age.\u201d 29\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7633a(a).The Government interprets this provision to\nimpose liability only when age is a but-for cause of an employment\ndecision. According to the Government, even if age played a part in\nsuch a decision, an employee or applicant for employment cannot\nobtain any relief unless it is shown that the decision would have\nbeen favorable if age had not been taken into account. This\ninterpretation, the Government contends, follows both from the\nmeaning of the statutory text and from the \u201cdefault rule\u201d that we\nhave recognized in other employment discrimination cases, namely,\nthat recovery for wrongful conduct is generally permitted only if\nthe injury would not have occurred but for that conduct. See,e.g.,University of Tex. Southwestern Medical Centerv.Nassar,570 U.S.\n338, 346\u2013347 (2013).Babb interprets the provision differently. She\nmaintains that its language prohibits any adverse consideration of\nage in the decision-makingprocess.Accordingly, she argues\nproof that age was a but-for cause of a challenged employment\ndecision is not needed.AWhich interpretation is correct? To decide, we\nstart with the text of the statute, seeGrossv.FBL\nFinancial Services,Inc.,557\nU.S. 167, 175 (2009), and as it turns out, it is not necessary\nto go any further. The plain meaning of the statutory text shows\nthat age need not be a but-for cause of an employment decision in\norder for there to be a violation of \u00a7633a(a). To explain the basis\nfor our interpretation, we will first define the important terms in\nthe statute and then consider how they relate to each other.1Section 633a(a) concerns \u201cpersonnel actions,\u201d\nand while the ADEA does not define this term, its meaning is easy\nto understand. The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, which governs\nfederal employment, broadly defines a \u201cpersonnel action\u201d to include\nmost employment-related decisions, such as appointment, promotion,\nwork assignment, compensation, and performance reviews. See 5\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72302(a)(2)(A). That interpretation is\nconsistent with the term\u2019s meaning in general usage, and we assume\nthat it has the same meaning under the ADEA.Under \u00a7633a(a), personnel actions must be made\n\u201cfree from\u201d discrimination. The phrase \u201cfree from\u201d means\n\u201cuntainted\u201d or \u201c[c]lear of (something which is regarded as\nobjectionable).\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 905\n(def. 4(a)(2)) (1976); 4 Oxford English Dictionary 521 (def. 12)\n(1933); see also American Heritage Dictionary 524 (def. 5(a))\n(1969) (defining \u201cfree\u201d \u201cused with from\u201d as \u201c[n]ot affected or\nrestricted by a given condition or circumstance\u201d); Random House\nDictionary of the English Language 565 (def. 12) (1966) (defining\n\u201cfree\u201d as \u201cexempt or released from something specified that\ncontrols, restrains, burdens, etc.\u201d). Thus, under \u00a7633a(a), a\npersonnel action must be made \u201cuntainted\u201d by discrimination based\non age, and the addition of the term \u201cany\u201d (\u201cfree fromanydiscrimination based on age\u201d) drives the point home.[3] And as for \u201cdiscrimination,\u201d we assume\nthat it carries its \u201c\u00a0\u2018normal definition,\u2019\u00a0\u201d which is\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018differential treatment.\u2019\u00a0\u201dJacksonv.Birm-\ningham Bd. of Ed.,544 U.S.\n167, 174 (2005).Under \u00a7633a(a), the type of discrimination\nforbidden is \u201cdiscrimination based on age,\u201d and \u201c[i]n common talk,\nthe phrase \u2018based on\u2019 indicates a but-for causal relationship.\u201dSafeco Ins. Co. of Americav.Burr,551 U.S.\n47, 63 (2007); cf.Comcast Corp.v.National Assn. of\nAfrican American-Owned Media,ante, at 6. Therefore,\n\u00a7633a(a) requires that age be a but-for cause of the discrimination\nalleged.What remains is the phrase \u201cshall be made.\u201d\n\u201c[S]hall be made\u201d is a form of the verb \u201cto make,\u201d which means \u201cto\nbring into existence,\u201d \u201cto produce,\u201d \u201cto render,\u201d and \u201cto cause to\nbe or become.\u201d Random House Dictionary of the English Language, at\n866. Thus, \u201cshall be made\u201d means \u201cshall be produced,\u201d etc. And the\nimperative mood, denoting a duty, see Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1233\n(5th ed. 1979), emphasizes the importance of avoiding the\ntaint.2So much for the individual terms used in\n\u00a7633a(a). What really matters for present purposes is the way these\nterms relate to each other. Two matters of syntax are critical.\nFirst, \u201cbased on age\u201d is an adjectival phrase that modifies the\nnoun \u201cdiscrimination.\u201d It does not modify \u201cpersonnel actions.\u201d The\nstatute does not say that \u201cit is unlawful to take personnel actions\nthat are based on age\u201d; it says that \u201cpersonnel actions\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. shall be made free from any discrimination based on\nage.\u201d \u00a7633a(a). As a result, age must be a but-for cause of\ndiscrimination\u2014that is, of differential treatment\u2014but not\nnecessarily a but-for cause of a personnel action itself.Second, \u201cfree from any discrimination\u201d is an\nadverbial phrase that modifies the verb \u201cmade.\u201dIbid. Thus,\n\u201cfree from any discrimination\u201d describes how a personnel action\nmust be \u201cmade,\u201d namely, in a way that is not tainted by\ndifferential treatment based on age. If age discrimination plays\nany part in the way a decision is made, then the decision is not\nmade in a way that is untainted by such discrimination.This is the straightforward meaning of the terms\nof \u00a7633a(a), and it indicates that the statute does not require\nproof that an employment decision would have turned out differently\nif age had not been taken into account.To see what this entails in practice, consider a\nsimple example. Suppose that a decision-maker is trying to decide\nwhether to promote employee A, who is 35 years old, or employee B,\nwho is 55. Under the employer\u2019s policy, candidates for promotion\nare first given numerical scores based on non-discriminatory\nfactors. Candidates over the age of 40 are then docked five points,\nand the employee with the highest score is promoted. Based on the\nnon-discriminatory factors, employee A (the 35-year-old) is given a\nscore of 90, and employee B (the 55-year-old) gets a score of 85.\nBut employee B is then docked 5 points because of age and thus ends\nup with a final score of 80. The decision-maker looks at the\ncandidates\u2019 final scores and, seeing that employee A has the higher\nscore, promotes employee A.This decision is not \u201cmade\u201d \u201cfree from any\ndiscrimination\u201d because employee B was treated differently (and\nless favorably) than employee A (because she was docked five points\nand A was not). And this discrimination was \u201cbased on age\u201d because\nthe five points would not have been taken away were it not for\nemployee B\u2019s age.It is true that this difference in treatment did\nnot affect the outcome, and therefore age was not a but-for cause\nof the decision to promote employee A. Employee A would have won\nout even if age had not been considered and employee B had not lost\nfive points, since A\u2019s score of 90 was higher than B\u2019s initial,\nlegitimate score of 85. But under the language of \u00a7633a(a), this\ndoes not preclude liability.The Government has no answer to this parsing of\nthe statutory text. It makes two correct points: first, that\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018discrimination based on age\u2019\u00a0\u201d \u201crequires but-for\ncausation,\u201d and, second, that \u201c\u00a0\u2018discrimination\u2019\u00a0\u201d means\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018\u00a0\u201cdifferential treatment.\u201d\u00a0\u2019\u00a0\u201d Brief for\nRespondent 16\u201317. But based on these two points, the Government\ndraws the unwarranted conclusion that \u201c[i]t is thus not enough for\na federal employer merely toconsiderage .\u00a0.\u00a0. if\nthat consideration does not actually cause the employer to make a\nless favorable personnel action than it would have made for a\nsimilarly situated person who is younger.\u201dId., at 17. That\nconclusion does not follow from the two correct points on which it\nclaims to be based. What follows instead is that, under \u00a7633a(a),\nage must be the but-for cause ofdifferential treatment, not\nthat age must be a but-for cause ofthe ultimate\ndecision.[4]BThe Government\u2019s primary argument rests not on\nthe text of \u00a7633a(a) but on prior cases interpreting different\nstatutes. But contrary to the Government\u2019s argument, nothing in\nthese past decisions undermines our interpretation of \u00a7633a(a).1.\u2002InSafeco Ins. Co. of Americav.Burr, 551 U.\u00a0S., at 63, we interpreted a provision of\nthe Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) requiring that notice be\nprovided \u201c[i]f any person takes anyadverse actionwith\nrespect to any consumer that isbasedin whole or in parton any information contained in a consumer [credit] report.\u201d\n15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71681m(a) (emphasis added). This language is\nquite different from that of 29 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7633a(a).In \u00a71681m(a), the phrase \u201cbased .\u00a0.\u00a0.\non any information contained in a consumer [credit] report\u201d\nmodifies \u201cadverse action,\u201d and thus the information in question\nmust be a but-for cause of the adverse action. By contrast, in\n\u00a7633a(a), \u201cbased on\u201d does not modify \u201cpersonnel actions\u201d; it\nmodifies \u201cdiscrimination,\u201di.e., differential treatment\nbased on age.The Government tries to find support inSafeco\u2019s discussion of FCRA\u2019s reference to an adverse action\nthat is \u201cbased .\u00a0.\u00a0.in part\u201d on a credit report.\n15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71681m(a) (emphasis added). TheSafecoCourt observed that the phrase \u201cin part\u201d could be read to mean that\nnotice had to be given \u201cwhenever the report was considered in the\nrate-setting process,\u201d but it rejected this reading. 551\nU.\u00a0S., at 63. The Government suggests that the Court reached\nthis conclusion because it thought that Congress would have \u201csaid\nso expressly\u201d if it had meant to require notice in situations where\nconsideration of a credit report was inconsequential. Brief for\nRespondent 19. Accordingly, the Government argues, because \u00a7633a(a)\ndoes not say expressly that consideration of age is unlawful, we\nshould conclude that mere consideration is insufficient to trigger\nliability. Seeid., at 19\u201320.This argument fails for two reasons. First, as\nexplained above, the language of \u00a7633a(a)doesexpressly\nimpose liability if age discrimination plays a part in a federal\nemployment decision. Second,Safecodid not invoke the sort\nof super-plain-statement rule that the Government now attributes to\nit. Instead, theSafecoCourt rejected the argument on other\ngrounds, including its assessment of the particular statutory\nscheme at issue. See 551 U.\u00a0S., at 63\u201364. That reasoning\nobviously has no application here.2.\u2002InGrossv.FBL Financial\nServices,Inc.,557 U.S.\n167, we interpreted the private-sector provision of the ADEA,\n29 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7623(a)(1), and held that it requires a\nplaintiff to prove that \u201cage was the \u2018but-for\u2019 cause of the\nemployer\u2019s adverse action.\u201d 557 U.\u00a0S., at 177. But as we\npreviously recognized, the ADEA\u2019s private- and public-sector\nprovisions are \u201ccouched in very different terms.\u201dG\u00f3mez-P\u00e9rezv.Potter,553 U.S.\n474, 488 (2008).Section 623(a)(1) makes it \u201cunlawful for an\nemployer .\u00a0.\u00a0. to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge\nany individual or otherwise discriminate against any individual\nwith respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges\nof employment, because of such individual\u2019s age.\u201d Thus, the but-for\ncausal language in \u00a7623(a)(1)\u2013\u2013\u201cbecause of such individual\u2019s\nage\u201d\u2013\u2013is an adverbial phrase modifying the verbs (\u201cto fail or\nrefuse to hire,\u201d etc.) that specify the conduct that the provision\nregulates. For this reason, the syntax of \u00a7623(a)(1) is critically\ndifferent from that of \u00a7633a(a), where, as noted, the but-for\nlanguage modifies the noun \u201cdiscrimination.\u201d This is important\nbecause all the verbs in \u00a7623(a)(1)\u2014failing or refusing to hire,\ndischarging, or otherwise discriminating with respect to\n\u201ccompensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of\nemployment\u201d\u2014refer to end results.[5] By contrast, the provision in our case, \u00a7633a(a),\nprohibits any age discrimination in the \u201cmak[ing]\u201d of a personnel\ndecision, not just with respect to end results.3. Finally, inUniversity of Tex.\nSouthwestern Medical Centerv.Nassar,570 U.S.\n338, we interpreted Title VII\u2019s anti-retaliation provision, 42\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72000e\u20133(a), as requiring retaliation to be a\nbut-for cause of the end result of the employment decision. The\nCourt saw no \u201cmeaningful textual difference between the text [of\nthat provision] and the one inGross,\u201d 570 U.\u00a0S., at\n352, and the Court found support for its interpretation in the rule\nthat recovery for an intentional tort generally requires proof\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018that the harm would not have occurred\u2019 in the absence\nof\u2014that is, but for\u2014the defendant\u2019s conduct.\u201d 570 U.\u00a0S., at\n346\u2013347 (quoting Restatement of Torts \u00a7431, Commenta, pp.\n1159\u20131160 (1934)).That reasoning has no application in the present\ncase. The wording of \u00a7633a(a)\u2013\u2013which refers expressly to the\n\u201cmak[ing]\u201d of personnel actions in a way that is \u201cfree from any\ndiscrimination based on age\u201d\u2013\u2013is markedly different from the\nlanguage of the statutes at issue inGrossandNassar, and the traditional rule favoring but-for causation\ndoes not dictate a contrary result. Section 633a(a) requires proof\nof but-for causation, but the object of that causation is\n\u201cdiscrimination,\u201di.e., differential treatment, not the\npersonnel action itself.For these reasons,Safeco,Gross,\nandNassarare entirely consistent with our holding in this\ncase.CWe are not persuaded by the argument that it\nis anomalous to hold the Federal Government to a stricter standard\nthan private employers or state and local governments. That is what\nthe statutory language dictates, and if Congress had wanted to\nimpose the same standard on all employers, it could have easily\ndone so.As first enacted, the ADEA \u201capplied only to\nactions against private employers.\u201dLehmanv.Nakshian,453 U.S.\n156, 166 (1981). In 1974, \u201cCongress expanded the scope of the\nADEA\u201d to reach both state and local governments and the Federal\nGovernment.Ibid.To cover state and local governments,\nCongress simply added them to the definition of an \u201cemployer\u201d in\nthe ADEA\u2019s private-sector provision, see 29 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7630(b), and Congress could have easily done the same for the\nFederal Government. Indeed, the first proposal for expansion of the\nADEA to government entities did precisely that.Lehman, 453\nU.\u00a0S., at 166, n.\u00a014.But Congress did not choose this route. Instead,\nit \u201cdeliberately prescribed a distinct statutory scheme applicable\nonly to the federal sector,\u201did., at 166, and in doing so,\nit eschewed the language used in the private-sector provision,\n\u00a7623(a). SeeG\u00f3mez-P\u00e9rez, 553 U.\u00a0S., at 488. We\ngenerally ascribe significance to such a decision. SeeRussellov.United States,464 U.S.\n16, 23 (1983) (\u201c\u00a0\u2018[W]here Congress includes particular\nlanguage in one section of a statute but omits it in another\nsection of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress\nacts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or\nexclusion\u2019\u00a0\u201d).That Congress would want to hold the Federal\nGovernment to a higher standard than state and private employers is\nnot unusual. See Supp. Letter Brief for Respond- ent 1 (\u201cThe\nfederal government has long adhered to anti- discrimination\npolicies that are more expansive than those required by\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. the ADEA\u201d);e.g., Exec. Order No. 11478, \u00a71,\n3 CFR 446 (1969) (\u201cIt is the policy of the Government of the United\nStates to provide equal opportunity in Federal employment for all\npersons, to prohibit discrimination in employment .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nand to promote the full realization of equal employment opportunity\nthrough a continuing affirmative program\u201d); Exec.

And several years after adding\n\u00a7633a(a) to the ADEA, Congress amended the civil service laws to\nprescribe similar standards. See 5 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72301(b)(2)\n(\u201cFederal personnel management should be implemented consistent\nwith the .\u00a0.\u00a0. merit system principl[e that a]ll\nemployees and applicants for employment should receive fair and\nequitable treatment in all aspects of personnel management without\nregard to .\u00a0.\u00a0. age\u201d).In any event, \u201cwhere, as here, the words of [a]\nstatute are unambiguous, the \u2018\u00a0\u201cjudicial inquiry is\ncomplete.\u201d\u00a0\u2019\u00a0\u201dDesert Palace,Inc.v.Costa,539 U.S.\n90, 98 (2003) (quotingConnecticut Nat. Bankv.Germain,503 U.S.\n249, 254 (1992)).DWhile Babb can establish that the VA violated\n\u00a7633a(a) without proving that age was a but-for cause of the VA\u2019s\npersonnel actions, she acknowledges\u2014and we agree\u2014that but-for\ncausation is important in determining the appropriate remedy. It is\nbedrock law that \u201crequested relief\u00a0\u201d must \u201credress the alleged\ninjury.\u201dSteel Co.v.Citizens for Better\nEnvironment,523 U.S.\n83, 103 (1998). Thus, \u00a7633a(a) plaintiffs who demonstrate only\nthat they were subjected to unequal consideration cannot obtain\nreinstatement, backpay, compensatory damages, or other forms of\nrelief related to the end result of an employment decision. To\nobtain such remedies, these plaintiffs must show that age\ndiscrimination was a but-for cause of the employment outcome.We have long employed these basic principles. InTexasv.Lesage,528 U.S.\n18, 21\u201322 (1999) (per curiam), we applied this rule to a\nplaintiff who sought recovery under Rev. Stat. \u00a71979, 42\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71983, for an alleged violation of the Equal\nProtection Clause. We explained: \u201c[W]here a plaintiff challenges a\ndiscrete governmental decision as being based on an impermissible\ncriterion and it is undisputed that the government would have made\nthe same decision regardless, there is no cognizable injury\nwarranting [damages] relief.\u201d 528 U.\u00a0S., at 21. Cf.Mt.\nHealthy City Bd. of Ed.v.Doyle,429 U.S.\n274, 285 (1977) (rejecting rule that \u201cwould require\nreinstatement .\u00a0.\u00a0. even if the same decision would have\nbeen reached had the incident not occurred\u201d).Our conclusion is also supported by traditional\nprinciples of tort and remedies law. \u201cRemedies generally seek to\nplace the victim of a legal wrong .\u00a0.\u00a0. in the position\nthat person would have occupied if the wrong had not occurred.\u201d R.\nWeaver, E. Shoben, & M. Kelly, Principles of Remedies Law 5 (3d\ned. 2017). Thus, \u201c[a]n actor\u2019s liability is limited to those harms\nthat result from the risks that made the actor\u2019s conduct tortious.\u201d\nRestatement (Third) of Torts \u00a729, p.\u00a0493 (2005). Remedies\nshould not put a plaintiff in a more favorable position than he or\nshe would have enjoyed absent discrimination. But this is precisely\nwhat would happen if individuals who cannot show that\ndiscrimination was a but-for cause of the end result of a personnel\naction could receive relief that alters or compensates for the end\nresult.Although unable to obtain such relief,\nplaintiffs are not without a remedy if they show that age was a\nbut-for cause of differential treatment in an employment decision\nbut not a but-for cause of the decision itself. In that situation,\nplaintiffs can seek injunctive or other forward-looking relief.\nDetermining what relief, if any, is appropriate in the present case\nis a matter for the District Court to decide in the first instance\nif Babb succeeds in showing that \u00a7633a(a) was violated.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*The judgment of the United States Court of\nAppeals for the Eleventh Circuit is reversed, and the case is\nremanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.Notes1*Justice Ginsburg joins all but\nfootnote 3 of this opinion.2The General Schedule (GS)\nis a federal pay scale that is divided into 15 numbered grades. See\n5 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a75104. \u201c[A]s the number of the grade\nincreases, so do pay and responsibilities.\u201dUnited Statesv.Clark,454 U.S.\n555, 557 (1982).3We have repeatedly\nexplained that \u201c\u00a0\u2018the word \u201cany\u201d has an expansive\nmeaning.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAliv.Federal Bureau of Prisons,552 U.S.\n214, 219 (2008) (quotingUnited Statesv.Gonzales,520 U.S.\n1, 5 (1997)). The standard dictionary definition of \u201cany\u201d is\n\u201c[s]ome, regardless of quantity or number.\u201d American Heritage\nDictionary 59 (def. 2) (1969).4Beyond this, the\nGovernment\u2019s only other textual argument is that the term \u201cmade\u201d\nrefers to a particular moment in time,i.e., the moment when\nthe final employment decision is made. We agree, but this does not\nmean that age must be a but-for cause of the ultimate outcome. If,\nat the time when the decision is actually made, age plays a part,\nthen the decision is not made \u201cfree from\u201d age discrimination. It is\nnot clear that Babb actually disagrees with the Government on this\npoint, although the many references in her brief to the\ndecision-making process could be read to mean that \u00a7633a(a) can be\nviolated even if age played no part whatsoever when the actual\ndecision was made. If that is what Babb wants to suggest, however,\nwe must disagree. It is entirely natural to regard an employment\ndecision as being \u201cmade\u201d at the time when the outcome is actually\ndetermined and not during events leading up to that decision. See\nAmerican Heritage Dictionary, at 788 (def. 10) (defining \u201cmake\u201d as\n\u201c[t]o arrive at\u201d a particular conclusion,i.e., to\u201cmake\na decision\u201d). And holding that \u00a7633a(a) is violated when the\nconsideration of age plays no role in the final decision would have\nstartling implications. Consider this example: A decision-maker\nmust decide whether to promote employee A, who is under 40, or\nemployee B, who is over 40. A subordinate recommends employee A and\nsays that the recommendation is based in part on employee B\u2019s age.\nThe decision-maker rebukes this subordinate for taking age into\naccount, disregards the recommendation, and makes the decision\nindependently. Under an interpretation that read \u201cmade\u201d expansively\nto encompass a broader personnel process, \u00a7633a(a) would be\nviolated even though age played no role whatsoever in the ultimate\ndecision. Indeed, there might be a violation even if the\ndecision-maker decided to promote employee B. We are aware of no\nother anti-discrimination statute that imposes liability under such\ncircumstances, and we do not think that \u00a7633a(a) should be\nunderstood as the first.5Moreover, even if\n\u201cdiscriminating with respect to compensation, terms, conditions, or\nprivileges of employment\u201d could be read more broadly to encompass\nthings that occur before a final decision is made, theejusdem\ngeneriscanon would counsel a court to read that final phrase\nto refer\u2013\u2013like the prior terms\u2013\u2013to the final decision.
