I\nnote, however, that the application of such domestic doctrines is\nsubject to an important limitation: Any applicable domestic\ndoctrines must be rooted in the principle of consent to\narbitrate.This limitation is part and parcel of the\nFederal Arbitration Act (FAA) itself. It is a \u201cbasic precept,\u201dStolt-Nielsen S.\u00a0A.v.AnimalFeeds Int\u2019l Corp.,559 U.S.\n662, 681 (2010), that \u201c[a]rbitration under the [FAA] is a\nmatter of consent, not coercion,\u201dVolt Information Sciences,\nInc.v.Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior\nUniv.,489 U.S.\n468, 479 (1989); see also,e.g.,Lamps Plus, Inc.v.Varela, 587 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2019) (slip op., at 7)\n(\u201cConsent is essential under the FAA\u201d);Granite Rock Co.v.Teamsters,561 U.S.\n287, 299 (2010) (\u201c[T]he first principle that underscores all of\nour arbitration decisions\u201d is that \u201c[a]rbitration is strictly \u2018a\nmatter of consent\u2019\u00a0\u201d). \u201cWe have emphasized th[is]\n\u2018foundational FAA principle\u2019 many times,\u201dLamps Plus, 587\nU.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 7) (quotingStolt-Nielsen,\n559 U.\u00a0S., at 684) (citing cases), and even the parties find\ncommon ground on the point, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 7, 49; Brief for\nRespondents 2.Because this consent principle governs the FAA\non the whole, it constrains any domestic doctrines under Chapter 1\nof the FAA that might \u201cappl[y]\u201d to Convention proceedings (to the\nextent they do not \u201cconflict with\u201d the Convention). 9\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7208; cf.ante, at 5\u20136. Parties seeking\nto enforce arbitration agreements under Article II of the\nConvention thus may not rely on domestic nonsignatory doctrines\nthat fail to reflect consent to arbitrate.While the FAA\u2019s consent principle itself is\ncrystalline, it is admittedly difficult to articulate a bright-line\ntest for determining whether a particular domestic nonsignatory\ndoctrine reflects consent to arbitrate. That is in no small part\nbecause some domestic nonsignatory doctrines vary from jurisdiction\nto jurisdiction. With equitable estoppel, for instance, one\nformulation of the doctrine may account for a party\u2019s consent to\narbitrate while another does not. Cf. Brief for Respondents 45\n(maintaining that courts have applied at least \u201cthree different\nversions\u201d of GE Energy\u2019s equitable-estoppel theory, including one\nthat allegedly \u201callows a non-party to force arbitration even of\nclaims wholly unconnected to the agreement\u201d). Lower courts must\ntherefore determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether applying a\ndomestic nonsignatory doctrine would violate the FAA\u2019s inherent\nconsent restriction.[1]*Article II of the Convention leaves much to the\ncontracting states to resolve on their own, and the FAA imposes few\nrestrictions. Nevertheless, courts applying domestic nonsignatory\ndoctrines to enforce arbitration agreements under the Convention\nmust strictly adhere to \u201cthe foundational FAA principle that\narbitration is a matter of consent.\u201dStolt-Nielsen, 559\nU.\u00a0S., at 684. Because the Court\u2019s opinion is consistent with\nthis limitation, I join it in full.Notes1*\u00a0In this case, however, I\nam skeptical that any domestic nonsignatory doctrines need come\ninto play at all, because Outokumpu appears to have expressly\nagreed to arbitrate disputes under the relevant contract with\nsubcontractors like GE Energy. The contract provided that disputes\narising between the buyer and seller in connection with the\ncontract were subject to arbitration. App. 171. It also specified\nthat the seller in the contract \u201cshall be understood\u201d to include\n\u201c[s]ub-contractors.\u201d Id., at 88\u201389. And it appended a list of\npotential subcontractors, one of which was GE Energy\u2019s predecessor,\nConverteam. Id., at 184\u2013185.",
