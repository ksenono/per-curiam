MITCHELL, PETITIONERv.WISCONSINon writ of certiorari to the supreme court of\nwisconsin[June 27, 2019]Justice Gorsuch, dissenting.We took this case to decide whether Wisconsin\ndrivers impliedly consent to blood alcohol tests thanks to a state\nstatute. That law says that anyone driving in Wisconsin agrees\u2014by\nthe very act of driving\u2014to testing under certain circumstances. But\nthe Court today declines to answer the question presented. Instead,\nit upholds Wisconsin\u2019s law on an entirely different ground\u2014citing\nthe exigent circumstances doctrine. While I do not doubt that the\nCourt may affirm for any reason supported by the record, the\napplication of the exigent circumstances doctrine in this area\nposes complex and difficult questions that neither the parties nor\nthe courts below discussed. Rather than proceeding solely by\nself-direction, I would have dismissed this case as improvidently\ngranted and waited for a case presenting the exigent circumstances\nquestion.",
