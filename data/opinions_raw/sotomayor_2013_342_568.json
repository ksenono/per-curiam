That is wrong, becausePadilladid nothing more than apply the existing rule ofStricklandv.Washington,466\nU.S. 668(1984), in a new setting, the same way the Court has\ndone repeatedly in the past: by surveying the relevant professional\nnorms and conclud- ing that they unequivocally required attorneys\nto provide advice about the immigration consequences of a guilty\nplea. BecausePadillafell squarely within the metes and\nbounds established byStrickland, I respectfully\ndissent.IAThe majority correctly sets forth the\ngoverning legal principles underTeagueandStrickland.Ante,at 4\u20135.TheTeagueinquiry turns centrally on the \u201cnature of the rule\u201d in question,\nand for that reason, \u201c[w]here the beginning point is a rule of .\n.\u00a0. general application, . . . it will be the infrequent case\nthat yields a result so novel that it forges a new rule.\u201dWrightv.West,505 U.S.\n277, 308\u2013309 (1992) (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment); seeante,at 4\u20135. The majority makes the important observation\nthat\u201cwhen all we do is apply a general standard to the kind\nof factual circumstances it was meant to address, we will rarely\nstate a new rule.\u201dIbid.It makes sense, then, that\n\u201cgarden-variety applications of . . .Strickland. . . do\nnot produce new rules.\u201dAnte,at 5.InStrickland, we did not provide a\ncomprehensive def- inition of deficient performance, and instead\nheld that \u201c[t]he proper measure of attorney performance remains\nsimply reasonableness under prevailing professional norms.\u201d 466\nU.\u00a0S., at 688.Strickland\u2019s reasonableness prong\ntherefore takes its content from the standards by which lawyers\njudge their professional obligations,ibid.,and those\nstandards are subject to change. That is why, despite the many\ndifferent settings in which it has been applied, we have never\nfound that an application ofStricklandresulted in a new\nrule.[1]Significantly, we have previously found that\napplications ofStricklandto new factual scenarios are not\nbarred under 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72254(d)(1) of the Antiterrorism\nand Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA). Section 2254(d)(1)\nprecludes habeas relief unless a state court decision violates\n\u201cclearly established Federal law,\u201d which, as relevant here, largely\noverlaps with the inquiry underTeagueof whether a decision\nwas \u201cdictatedby precedent.\u201d 489 U.\u00a0S., at 301\n(plurality opinion).[2] InWigginsv.Smith,539\nU.S. 510, 522 (2003), for example, we found thatWilliamsv.Taylor,529 U.S.\n362(2000), \u201cmade no new law\u201d when it held thatStricklandextended to an attorney\u2019s responsibility to\nconduct a background investigation in a capital case. Rather, we\nexplained that\u201cin referring to the ABA Standards for\nCriminal Justice as guides, [Williams] applied the same\n\u2018clearly established\u2019 precedent ofStricklandwe apply\ntoday.\u201d 539 U.\u00a0S., at 522. Similarly, inLaflerv.Cooper, 566 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___, ___\u2013___ (2012) (slip op.,\nat 6, 14\u201316), we rejected the argument advanced by the Solicitor\nGeneral that the Sixth Amendment did not extend to advice about a\nplea offer because it did not impact the fairness of the trial.\nInstead, we simply held thatStricklandapplied to this form\nof attorney misconduct.In short, where we merely applyStricklandin a way that corresponds to an evolution in\nprofessional norms, we make no new law.BContrary to the majority\u2019s reconstruction,Padillais built squarely on the foundation laid out byStrickland.Padillarelied upon controlling\nprecedent. It began by reciting the basic rule that \u201c[u]nderStrickland, we first determine whether counsel\u2019s\nrepresentation \u2018fell below an objective standard of\nreasonableness.\u2019\u00a0\u201dPadilla, 559 U.\u00a0S., at ___\n(slip op., at 9) (quotingStrickland, 466 U.\u00a0S., at\n688). We recognized that \u201c[t]he first prong\u2014constitutional\ndeficiency\u2014is necessarily linked to the practice and expectations\nof the legal community: \u2018[t]he proper measure of attorney\nperformance remains reasonableness under pre- vailing professional\nnorms.\u2019\u00a0\u201dPadilla, 559 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at\n9) (quotingStrickland, 466 U.\u00a0S., at 688).We therefore examined the substantial changes in\nfed- eral immigration law that provided the backdrop to the\nrelevant professional standards.Padilla, 559 U.\u00a0S., at\n___ (slip op., at 2\u20136). Pursuant to the Immigration Act of 1917,\n39Stat. 889\u2013890, a judge could recommend that a defendant who had\ncommitted a deportable offense not be removed from the country.\nCongress entirely eliminated this procedure in 1990. 104Stat. 5050.\nThen the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility\nAct of 1996 (IIRIRA), 110Stat. 3009\u2013596, abolished the Attor- ney\nGeneral\u2019s authority to grant discretionary relief from removal for\nall but a small number of offenses.Padilla, 559 U.\u00a0S.,\nat ___ (slip op., at 6). These changes in immigration law meant\nthat for a noncitizen who committed a removable offense, \u201cremoval\n[had become] practically inevitable.\u201dIbid.In parallel with these developments, the\nstandards of professional responsibility relating to immigration\nhad become more demanding. \u201cFor at least the past 15 years,\u201d we\nobserved inPadilla, \u201cprofessional norms have gener- ally\nimposed an obligation on counsel to provide advice on the\ndeportation consequences of a client\u2019s plea.\u201dId.,at ___\n(slip op., at 15). Citing an array of practice guides and\nprofessional responsibility manuals, we noted that \u201c[t]he weight of\nprevailing professional norms supports the view that counsel must\nadvise her client regarding the risk of deportation.\u201dId.,at ___ (slip op., at 9). Indeed, \u201cauthorities of every\nstripe\u2014including the American Bar Association, criminal defense and\npublic defender organizations, authoritative treatises, and state\nand city bar publications\u2014universally require defense attorneys to\nadvise as to the risk of deportation consequences for non-citizen\nclients.\u201dId.,at ___ (slip op., at 10) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).We drew further support for our conclusion that\nprofessional standards required advice about deportation\nconsequences from our decision inINSv.St. Cyr,533 U.S.\n289(2001). SeePadilla, 559 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 10\u201311) (citingSt. Cyr, 533 U.\u00a0S., at 323). InSt. Cyr, we had explained that the availability of\ndiscretionary relief from removal was critical to a noncitizen\u2019s\ndecision to accept a plea offer, and expected counsel to follow the\ninstructions of \u201cnumerous practice guides,\u201d such as the ABA\u2019s\nStandards for Criminal Justice, to inform themselves of the\npossible immigration consequences of a plea.Padilla, 559\nU.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 11) (citingSt. Cyr, 533\nU.\u00a0S., at 323, n. 50); seeid.,at 322, n. 48. And we\nthere found that many States already required that a trial judge\nadvise defendants of the same.Ibid. St. Cyrthus\n\u201crecognized that \u2018preserving the client\u2019s right to remain in the\nUnited States may be more important to the client than any\npotential jail sentence.\u2019\u00a0\u201dPadilla, 559 U.\u00a0S., at\n___ (slip op., at 10) (quotingSt. Cyr, 533 U.\u00a0S., at\n322).Our application ofStricklandinPadillafollowed naturally from these earlier observations\nabout changes in immigration law and the accompanying evolution of\nprofessional norms. When we decidedSt. CyrandPadilla, nothing aboutStrickland\u2019s substance or\napplicability had changed. The only difference from prior law was\nthat the underlying professional norms had changed such that\ncounsel\u2019s failure to give this advice now amounted to\nconstitutionally deficient performance.[3] Both beforePadillaand after, counsel was\nobligated to follow the relevant professional norms. It was only\nbecause those norms reflected changes in immigration law thatPadillareached the result it did, not because the Sixth\nAmendment right had changed at all.IIAAccepting that routine applications ofStricklanddo not result in new rules, the majority\nnevertheless holds thatPadillawent a step further. In its\nview,Padilla\u201c\u00a0\u2018br[oke] new ground\u2019\u00a0\u201d by\naddressing the threshold question of whether advice about\ndeportation is a collateral consequence of a criminal conviction\nthat falls within the scope of the Sixth Amendment.Ante,at\n9\u201310. But that is wrong, becausePadilladeclined to embrace\nthe very distinction between collateral and direct consequences of\na criminal conviction that the majority says it did. In fact, the\nCourt stated very clearly that it found the distinction irrelevant\nfor the purposes of determining a defense lawyer\u2019s obligation to\nprovide advice about the immigration consequences of a plea. 559\nU.\u00a0S., at ___, n. 8 (slip op., at 7, n. 8). We asserted that\nwe had \u201cnever applied a dis- tinction between direct and collateral\nconsequences to define the scope of constitutionally \u2018reasonable\nprofessional assistance\u2019 required underStrickland,\u201d and\nconcluded that \u201c[w]hether that distinction is appropriateis a\nquestion we need not considerin this case.\u201dId.,at ___\n(slip op., at 8) (emphasis added). The distinction was \u201cill suited\u201d\nto the task at hand, we explained, because deportation has a \u201cclose\nconnection to the criminal process,\u201d and is \u201cuniquely difficult to\nclassify as either a direct or a collateral consequence.\u201dId.,at ___ (slip op., at 8\u20139). Indeed, \u201c[o]ur law ha[d]\nenmeshed criminal convictions and the penalty of de- portation for\nnearly a century,\u201d and we had \u201clong recognized\u201d that deportation is\n\u201cparticularly severe.\u201dId., at ___ (slip op., at\n8).[4]At bottom, then, the majority\u2019s argument hinges\nupon a distinction the Court has never embraced and thatPadillafound irrelevant to the issue it ultimately decided.\nWithout this revision to our recent decisional history, the\nmajority\u2019s analysis unravels.BThe majority finds that the \u201clegal landscape,\u201dGrahamv.Collins,506 U.S.\n461, 468 (1993), beforePadillawas nearly uniform in\nits rejection ofStrickland\u2019s application to the deportation\nconsequences of a plea.Ante,at 7\u201310. It concludes that the\nlower courts were generally in agreement that the Sixth Amendment\ndid not require attorneys to inform clients of the collateral\nconsequences of a plea, and that this weighs heavily in favor of\nfinding thatPadillaannounced a new rule.Ante, at\n7\u20138, nn. 7, 8. But the majority\u2019s discussion of these precedents\noperates at too high a level of generality and fails to account for\nthe development of professional standards over time.St. Cyrnoted the importance of advising clients about immigration\nconsequences was of recent vintage, indeed more re- cent than some\nof the cases the majority cites. See 533 U.\u00a0S., at 322\u2013323.\nThe Court relies upon decisions issued over a period that spans\nmore than 30 years. Seeante, at 7\u20138, nn. 7, 8.Nearly half of them (17) were decided before the enactment of\nIIRIRA. Seeibid.And all but two of the Federal Court of\nAppeals cases were decided beforeSt. Cyr. Seeante,at 7\u20138, nn. 7, 8. These earlier decisions show nothing more than\nthat the underlying professional norms had not yet evolved to\nrequire attorneys to provide advice about deportation\nconsequences.Cases from the period following IIRIRA andSt. Cyrundermine the majority\u2019s generalizations about the\nstate of the law beforePadilla. Deportation had long been\nun- derstood by lower courts to present \u201cthe most difficult\u201d\npenalty to classify as either a collateral or direct consequence.United Statesv.Russell,686 F.2d 35, 38 (CADC\n1982); cf.Janvierv.United States, 793 F.2d 449,\n455 (CA2 1986) (holding thatStricklandapplied to advice\nabout a judicial recommendation against deportation). Eventually,\nand in parallel with changes in federal immigration law and the\ncorresponding professional norms, the lower courts had acknowledged\nan important qualification to the collateral consequences rule.\nAfter the passage of IIRIRA and this Court\u2019s decision inSt.\nCyr, many courts concluded that a lawyer\u2019s affirmative\nmisstatements about the immigration consequences of a guilty plea\ncan constitute deficient performance underStrickland.\nIndeed, each Federal Court of Appeals to address the question afterSt. Cyrso held. SeeUnited Statesv.Couto,311 F.3d 179, 188 (CA2 2002);United Statesv.\nKwan,407 F.3d 1005, 1015 (CA9 2005); cf.Downs-Morganv.United States, 765 F.2d 1534, 1540\u20131541 (CA11\n1985).[5] State-court decisions\nfrom this period were in accord and relied upon similar\nreasoning.[6]These decisions created an important exception\nto the collateral/direct consequences distinction. They also\nforeshadowed the Court\u2019s reasoning inPadillaby basing\ntheir analysis of the relevant professional norms on the special\nnature of deportation, the ABA standards governing immigration\npractice, and the Court\u2019s assessment of those standards inSt\nCyr. SeeKwan, 407 F.\u00a03d, at 1016 (\u201cThat counsel\nmay have misled [the defendant] out of ignorance is no excuse. It\nis a basic rule of professional conduct that a lawyer must\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. [remain] abreast of changes in the law and its\npractice.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. Counsel\u2019s performance\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. fell be- low the [ABA]\u2019s ethical standard for\ncriminal defense at- torneys with respect to immigration\nconsequences. The Supreme Court noted this standard in [St.\nCyr]\u201d);Couto, 311 F.\u00a03d, at 187\u2013191 (citingSt.\nCyrand the relevant ABA standards, and concluding that \u201crecent\nSupreme Court authority supports [a] broader view of attorney\nresponsibility\u201d that encompasses affirmative misrepresentations\nabout deportation consequences); see alsoDowns-Morgan, 765\nF.\u00a02d, at 1541 (\u201c[D]eportation and exclusion [are] harsh\nconsequences\u201d).The majority believes that these decisions did\nnot meaningfully alter the state of the law in the lower courts\nbeforePadilla, because they merely applied the age-old\nprinciple that a lawyer may not affirmatively mislead a client.Ante,at 12\u201313. But, as explained, the reasoning of these\ncases renders that characterization at best incomplete. See,e.g.,Kwan, 407 F.\u00a03d, at 1016. While these\nlower court precedents are consistent with the general principle\nthat attorneys should not mislead clients by providing incorrect\nadvice, they did not rest primarily on that rule. Rather, they\nrecognized the significant changes in professional norms that\npredatedPadillaand that we had noted inSt. Cyr. As\na consequence, the \u201cwall between direct and collateral\nconsequences\u201d that the lower courts had erected,ante, at 9,\nhad already been dealt a serious blow by the time the Court decidedPadilla.As the majority points out, these\nmisrepresentation cases stopped short of imposing an affirmative\nobligation on lawyers to consult with clients about the\nconsequences of deportation.Ante,at 12\u201313. But the\nmajority places too much emphasis on the absence of lower court\nauthority finding that an attorney\u2019s omissions with respect to\ndeportation resulted in ineffective assistance. The distinction\nbetween omissions and affirmative misrepresentations on which these\nlower court cases depended cannot be reconciled withStrickland. InPadillaitself, we rejected the\nSolicitor General\u2019s suggestion thatStricklandshould apply\nto advice about the immigration consequences of a plea only in\ncases where defense counsel makes an affirmative misstatement.Padilla, 559 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 12). We did so\nbecause we found thatStricklandwas incompatible with the\ndistinction between an obligation to give advice and a prohibition\non affirmative misstatements. 559 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at\n12\u201313) (citingStrickland, 466 U.\u00a0S., at 690).Stricklandmade clear that its standard of attorney\nperformance applied to both \u201cacts\u201d and \u201comissions,\u201d and that a rule\nlimiting the performance inquiry to one or the other was too\nnarrow. 466 U.\u00a0S., at 690. Thus, the distinction between\nmisrepresentations and omissions, on which the majority relies in\nclassifying lower court precedent, implies a categorical rule that\nis inconsistent withStrickland\u2019s requirement of a\ncase-by-case assessment of an attorney\u2019s performance.[7]Id., at 688\u2013689; see,e.g.,Roev.Flores-Ortega,528\nU.S. 470, 479 (2000). In short, that some courts have\ndifferentiated between misleading by silence and affirmative\nmisrep- resentation hardly establishes the rationality of the\ndistinction. Notably, the Court offers no reasoned basis for\nbelieving that such a distinction can be extracted fromStrickland.To be sure, lower courts did continue to apply\nthe distinction between collateral and direct consequences afterSt. Cyr. Seeante,at 13\u201314; see,e.g.,\nBroomesv.Ashcroft,358 F.3d 1251, 1256\u20131257 (CA10 2004). Even so, and even\nassuming the misrepresentation cases did not call the distinction\ninto question, the existence of these lower court decisions is not\ndispositive. \u201c[T]he standard for determining when a case\nestablishes a new rule is \u2018objective,\u2019 and the mere existence of\nconflicting authority does not necessarily mean a rule is new.\u201dWright, 505 U.\u00a0S., at 304 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring in\njudgment) (citingStringerv.Black,503 U.S.\n222, 237 (1992)); seeGrahamv.Collins,506 U.S.\n461, 506 (1993) (Souter, J., dissenting).Where the application ofStricklandwas\nstraightforward, rooted in 15 years of professional standards and\nthe Court\u2019s priorSt. Cyrdecision, there is no reason to\nput these lower court cases, many from more than a decade earlier,\nahead of this Court\u2019s simple and clear reasoning inPadilla.\nNevertheless, the majority reaches the paradoxical conclusion that\nby declining to apply a collateral-consequence doctrine the Court\nhad never adopted,Padillaannounced a new rule.IIIWhat truly appears to drive the majority\u2019s\nanalysis is its sense thatPadillaoccasioned a serious\ndisruption in lower court decisional reasoning. See,e.g.,\nante,at 9\u201310 (\u201cIf that does not count as \u2018break[ing] new\nground\u2019 . . . we are hard pressed to know what would\u201d (quotingTeague, 489 U.\u00a0S., at 301)). The concurring and\ndissenting opinions inPadillasimilarly reflected the\nimpression that it was a significant and destabilizing decision.\nSee 559 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (Alito, J., concurring in judgment)\n(slip op., at 3);id.,at ___ (Scalia, J., dissenting) (slip\nop., at 5) (describing the majority opinion as a \u201csledge hammer\u201d);ante,at 8\u20139, n. 10. But the fact that a decision was\nperceived as momentous or consequential, particularly by those who\ndisagreed with it, does not control in theTeagueanalysis.\nFaithfully applying theTeaguerule depends instead on an\nexamination of this Court\u2019s reasoning and an objective assessment\nof the precedent at issue.Stringer, 503 U.\u00a0S., at 237.\nInPadilla, we did nothing more than applyStrickland. By holding to the contrary, today\u2019s decision\ndeprives defendants of the fundamental protection ofStrickland, which requires that lawyers comply with\nprofessional norms with respect to any advice they provide to\nclients.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*Accordingly, I would reverse the judgment of\nthe Seventh Circuit and hold thatPadillaapplies\nretroactively on collateral review to convictions that became final\nbefore its announcement. With respect, I dissent.Notes1See,e.g., Laflerv.Cooper, 566 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___\u2013___ (2012) (incorrect\nadvice leading to a plea offer\u2019s rejection);Rompillav.Beard,545 U.S.\n374(2005) (failure to investigate evidence the prosecution\nintended to use to prove an aggravating circumstance in a capital\ncase);Wigginsv.Smith,539\nU.S. 510(2003) (failure to investigate a defendant\u2019s social\nhistory in a capital case);Roev.Flores-Ortega,528 U.S.\n470(2000) (failure to consult with a defendant regarding\nwhether to pursue an appeal);Williamsv.Taylor,529 U.S.\n362, 391 (2000) (failure to investigate a defendant\u2019s\nbackground for the purposes of mitigation evidence in a capital\ncase);Hillv.Lockhart,474 U.S.\n52(1985) (failure to pro-vide effective assistance during plea\nnegotiations).2AEDPA of course differs\nfrom theTeaguerule in other important respects. See,e.g.,Greenev.Fisher, 565 U.\u00a0S. ___,\n___ (2011) (slip op., at 5). But these differences aside, the fact\nthat we have repeatedly found AEDPA cases involvingStricklandto be controlled by established precedent\nunderscores that the application ofStricklandin a new\ncontext should almost never result in a new rule.3Even before IIRIRA andSt. Cyr, lawyers of course understood that it was good\npractice to inform clients of the deportation consequences of a\nplea. Seeante,at 14, n.15 (citing 3 ABA\nProject on Standards for Criminal Justice, Standards Relating to\nPleas of Guilty \u00a73.2(b), Commentary, p. 71 (App. Draft 1968)).\nFollowing the sea change in immigration law, however, the\nprofessional norms had become so established and universally\nrecognized that the measure of constitutionally adequate\nperformance now included giving such advice in the formPadillarecognized. See 559 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at\n10).4See,e.g., INSv. St. Cyr,533 U.S.\n289, 322 (2001) (noting that \u201c[p]reserving the client\u2019s right\nto remain in the United States may be more important . . . than any\npotential jail sentence\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted));Jordanv.De George,341 U.S.\n223, 243 (1951) (Jackson, J., dissenting) (deportation\nproceedings \u201cpractically . . . are [criminal] for they extend the\ncriminal process of sentencing to include on the same convictions\nan additional punishment\u201d);Fong Haw Tanv.Phelan,333 U.S.\n6,10(1948)\n(\u201c[D]eportation is a drastic measure and at times the equivalent of\nbanishment or exile\u201d);Ng Fung Hov.White,259 U.S.\n276, 284 (1922) (deportation may result in \u201closs of both\nproperty and life; or of all that makes life worth living\u201d);Fong Yue Tingv.United States,149 U.S.\n698, 740 (1893) (Brewer, J., dissenting) (\u201cEvery one knows that\nto be forcibly taken away from home, and family, and friends, and\nbusiness, and property, and sent across the ocean to a distant\nland, is punishment; and that oftentimes most severe and\ncruel\u201d).5SeeUnited Statesv.Mora-Gomez,875 F.
