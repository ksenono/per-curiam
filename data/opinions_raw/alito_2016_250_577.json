Because the\nTribe cannot establish extraordinary circumstances that stood in\nthe way of timely filing, we hold that equit-able tolling does not\napply.ICongress enacted the Indian Self-Determination\nand Education Assistance Act (ISDA), Pub. L. 93\u2013638, 88Stat. 2203,\n25 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7450et\u00a0seq.,in 1975 to help\nIndian tribes assume responsibility for aid programs that benefit\ntheir members. Under the ISDA, tribes may enter into\n\u201cself-determination contracts\u201d with federal agencies to take\ncontrol of a variety of federally funded programs. \u00a7450f. A\ncontracting tribe is eligible to receive the amount of money that\nthe Government would have otherwise spent on the program, see\n\u00a7450j\u20131(a)(1), as well as reimbursement for reasonable \u201ccontract\nsupport costs,\u201d which include administrative and overhead costs\nassociated with carrying out the contracted programs,\n\u00a7\u00a7450j\u20131(a)(2), (3), (5).In 1988, Congress amended the ISDA to apply the\nContract Disputes Act of 1978 (CDA), 41 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a77101et\u00a0seq., to disputes arising under the ISDA. See 25\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7450m\u20131(d); Indian Self-Determination and\nEducation Assistance Act Amendments of 1988, \u00a7206(2), 102Stat.\n2295. As part of its mandatory administrative process for resolving\ncontract disputes, the CDA requires contractors to present \u201c[e]ach\nclaim\u201d they may have to a contracting officer for decision. 41\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a77103(a)(1). Congress later amended the CDA to\ninclude a 6-year statute of limitations for presentment of each\nclaim. Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994, 41\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a77103(a)(4)(A).Under the CDA, the contracting officer\u2019s\ndecision is generally final, unless challenged through one of the\nstatutorily authorized routes. \u00a77103(g). A contractor dissatisfied\nwith the officer\u2019s decision may either take an administrative\nappeal to a board of contract appeals or file an action for breach\nof contract in the United States Court of Federal Claims.\n\u00a7\u00a77104(a), (b)(1), 7105(b). Both routes then lead to the United\nStates Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit for any further\nreview. 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71295(a)(3); 41 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a77107(a)(1); see 25 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7450m\u20131(d). Under the ISDA,\ntribal contractors have a third option. They may file a claim for\nmoney damages in federal district court, \u00a7\u00a7450m\u20131(a), (d), and if\nthey lose, they may pursue an appeal in one of the regional courts\nof appeals, 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71291.Tribal contractors have repeatedly complained\nthat the Federal Government has not fully honored its obligations\nto pay contract support costs. Three lawsuits making such claims\nare relevant here.The first was a class action filed by the Ramah\nNavajo Chapter alleging that the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA)\nsystematically underpaid certain contract support costs.Ramah\nNavajo Chapterv.Lujan, No. 1:90\u2013cv\u20130957 (D\u00a0NM)\n(filed Oct. 4, 1990). In 1993, Ramah successfully moved for\ncertification of a nationwide class of all tribes that had\ncontracted with the BIA under the ISDA. See Order and Memorandum\nOpinion inRamah Navajo Chapterv.Lujan, No.\n1:90\u2013cv\u20130957 (D\u00a0NM, Oct. 1, 1993), App. 35\u201340. The Government\nargued that each tribe needed to present its claims to a\ncontracting officer before it could participate in the class.Id.,at 37\u201338. But the trial court held that tribal\ncontractors could participate in the class without presentment,\nbecause the suit alleged systemwide flaws in the BIA\u2019s contracting\nscheme, not merely breaches of individual contracts.Id.,at\n39. The Government did not appeal the certification order, and theRamahclass action proceeded to further litigation and\nsettlement.The second relevant ISDA suit raised similar\nclaims about contract support costs but arose from contracts with\nthe Indian Health Service (IHS).Cherokee Nation of Okla.v.United States, No. 6:99\u2013cv\u20130092 (ED\u00a0Okla.) (filed Mar.\n5, 1999). InCherokee Nation, two tribes filed a putative\nclass action against IHS. On February 9, 2001, the District Court\ndenied class certification without addressing whether tribes would\nneed to present claims to join the class.Cherokee Nation of\nOkla.v.United States, 199 F.\u00a0R.\u00a0D. 357,\n363\u2013366 (ED\u00a0Okla.). The two plaintiff tribes did not appeal\nthe denial of class certification but proceeded to the merits on\ntheir own, eventually prevailing before this Court in a parallel\nsuit. SeeCherokee Nation of Okla.v.Leavitt, 543\nU.\u00a0S. 631 (2005) .The third relevant case is the one now before\nus. In this case, the Tribe presented its contract support claims\n(for contract years 1995 through 2004) to IHS on September 7, 2005,\nshortly after ourCherokee Nationruling. As relevant here,\nthe contracting officer denied the Tribe\u2019s claims based on its\n1996, 1997, and 1998 contracts because,inter alia,those\nclaims were barred by the CDA\u2019s 6-year statute of\nlimitations.[1] The Tribe\nchallenged the denials in the United States District Court for the\nDistrict of Columbia, arguing, based on theories of class-action\nand equitable tolling, that the limitations period should be tolled\nfor the 707 days that the putativeCherokee Nationclass had\nbeen pending. SeeAmerican Pipe & Constr. Co.v.Utah, 414 U.\u00a0S. 538 (1974) (class-action tolling);Hollandv.Florida, 560 U.\u00a0S. 631 (2010)\n(equitable tolling).Initially, the District Court held that the\nlimitations period was jurisdictional and thus forbade tolling of\nany sort. 539 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d 152, 154, and n.\u00a02 (DDC 2008).\nOn appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of\nColumbia Circuit concluded that the limitations period was not\njurisdictional and thus did not necessarily bar tolling. 614\nF.\u00a03d 519, 526 (2010). But the court held that the Tribe was\nineligible for class-action tolling during the pendency of the\nputativeCherokee Nationclass, because the Tribe\u2019s failure\nto present its claims to IHS made it \u201cineligible to participate in\nthe class action at the time class certification [was] denied.\u201d 614\nF.\u00a03d, at 527 (applyingAmerican Pipe). The court then\nremanded the case to the District Court to determine the Tribe\u2019s\neligibility for equitable tolling.On remand, the District Court concluded that the\nTribe\u2019s asserted reasons for failing to present its claims within\nthe specified time \u201cdo not, individually or collec-tively, amount\nto an extraordinary circumstance\u201d that could warrant equitable\ntolling. 841 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d 99, 107 (DC 2012) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). This time, the Court of Appeals affirmed. 764\nF.\u00a03d 51 (CADC 2014). It explained that, \u201c[t]o count as\nsufficiently \u2018extraordinary\u2019 to support equitable tolling, the\ncircumstances that caused a litigant\u2019s delay must have been beyond\nits control,\u201d and \u201ccannot be a product of that litigant\u2019s own\nmisunderstanding of the law or tactical mistakes in litigation.\u201dId., at 58. Because none of the Tribe\u2019s proffered\ncircumstances was beyond its control, the court held, there were no\nextraordinary circumstances that could merit equitable tolling.The Court of Appeals\u2019 decision created a split\nwith the Federal Circuit, which granted another tribal entity\nequitable tolling under similar circumstances. SeeArctic Slope\nNative Assn., Ltd.v.Sebelius, 699 F.\u00a03d 1289 (CA\nFed. 2012). We granted certiorari to resolve the conflict. 576\nU.\u00a0S. ___ (2015).IIThe Court of Appeals denied the Tribe\u2019s\nrequest for equitable tolling by applying the test that we\narticulated inHollandv.Florida, 560 U.\u00a0S. 631\n. UnderHolland, a litigant is entitled to equitable tolling\nof a statute of limitations only if the litigant establishes two\nelements: \u201c(1) that he has been pursuing his rights diligently, and\n(2) that some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way and\nprevented timely filing.\u201dId.,at 649 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).The Tribe calls this formulation of the\nequitable tolling test overly rigid, given the doctrine\u2019s equitable\nnature. First, it argues that diligence and extraordinary\ncircumstances should be considered together as two factors in a\nunitary test, and it faults the Court of Appeals for declining to\nconsider the Tribe\u2019s diligence in connection with its finding that\nno extraordinary circumstances existed. But we have expressly\ncharacterized equitable tolling\u2019s two components as \u201celements,\u201d not\nmerely factors of indeterminate or commensurable weight.Pacev.DiGuglielmo, 544 U.\u00a0S. 408, 418 (2005)\n(\u201cGenerally, a litigant seeking equitable tolling bears the burden\nof establishing two elements\u201d). And we have treated the two\nrequirements as distinct elements in practice, too, rejecting\nrequests for equitable tolling where a litigant failed to satisfy\none without addressing whether he satisfied the other. See,e.g.,Lawrencev.Florida, 549 U.\u00a0S. 327\n\u2013337 (2007) (rejecting equitable tolling without addressing\ndiligence because habeas petitioner fell \u201cfar short of showing\n\u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019\u00a0\u201d);Pace,supra,\nat 418 (holding, without resolving litigant\u2019s argument that he had\n\u201csatisfied the extraordinary circumstance test,\u201d that, \u201c[e]ven if\nwe were to accept [his argument], he would not be entitled to\nrelief because he has not established the requisite\ndiligence\u201d).Second, the Tribe objects to the Court of\nAppeals\u2019 interpretation of the \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d prong\nas requiring a litigant seeking tolling to show an \u201cexternal\nobstacl[e]\u201d to timely filing,i.e., that \u201cthe circumstances\nthat caused a litigant\u2019s delay must have been beyond its control.\u201d\n764 F.\u00a03d, at 58\u201359. The Tribe complains that this \u201cexternal\nobstacle\u201d formulation amounts to the same kind of \u201c\u00a0\u2018overly\nrigidper\u00a0seapproach\u2019\u00a0\u201d we rejected inHolland. Brief for Petitioner 32 (quoting 560 U.\u00a0S., at\n653). But in truth, the phrase \u201cexternal obstacle\u201d merely reflects\nour requirement that a litigant seeking tolling show \u201cthat some\nextraordinary circumstancestood in his way.\u201dId., at\n649 (emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted). This\nphrasing inHolland(and inPacebefore that) would\nmake little sense if equitable tolling were available when a\nlitigant was responsible for itsowndelay. Indeed, the\ndiligence prong already covers those affairs within the litigant\u2019s\ncontrol; the extraordinary-circumstances prong, by contrast, is\nmeant to cover matters outside its control. We therefore reaffirm\nthat the second prong of the equitable tolling test is met only\nwhere the circumstances that caused a litigant\u2019s delay are both\nextraordinaryandbeyond its control.[2]IIIThe Tribe offers no circumstances that meet\nthis standard.Its mistaken reliance on the putativeCherokee Nationclass action was not an obstacle beyond its\ncontrol.[3] As the Tribe\nconceded below, see 614 F.\u00a03d, at 526\u2013527, it could not have\nbeen a member of the putativeCherokee Nationclass because\nit did not present its claims to an IHS contracting officer before\nclass certification was denied. Before then, the Tribe had\nunilateral authority to present its claims and to join the putative\nclass. Presentment was blocked not by an obstacle outside its\ncontrol, but by the Tribe\u2019s mistaken belief that presentment was\nunneeded.The Tribe\u2019s mistake, in essence, was its\ninference that the reasoning of theRamahclass\ncertification decision (allowing tribes to participate\u2014without\npresentment\u2014in the class challenging underpayment of BIA contract\nsupport costs) applied to the putativeCherokee Nationclass. This mistake was fundamentally no different from \u201ca garden\nvariety claim of excusable neglect,\u201dIrwinv.Department\nof Veterans Affairs, 498 U.\u00a0S. 89, 96 (1990) , \u201csuch as a\nsimple \u2018miscalculation\u2019 that leads a lawyer to miss a filing\ndeadline,\u201dHolland,supra, at 651 (quotingLawrence,supra, at 336). And it is quite different\nfrom relying onactually bindingprecedent that is\nsubsequently reversed.[4]The Tribe\u2019s other excuses are even less\ncompelling. Its belief that presentment was futile was not an\nobstacle beyond its control but a species of the same mistake that\nkept it out of the putativeCherokee Nationclass. And the\nfact that there may have been significant risk and expense\nassociated with presenting and litigating its claims is far from\nextraordinary. As the District Court noted below, \u201cit is common for\na litigant to be confronted with significant costs to litigation,\nlimited financial resources, an uncertain outcome based upon an\nuncertain legal landscape, and impending deadlines. These\ncircumstances are not \u2018extraordinary.\u2019\u00a0\u201d 841 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d,\nat 107.Finally, the Tribe also urges us to consider the\nspecial relationship between the United States and Indian tribes,\nas articulated in the ISDA. See 25 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7450a(b)\n(\u201cCongress declares its commitment to the maintenance of the\nFederal Government\u2019s unique and continuing relationship with, and\nresponsibility to, individual Indian tribes and to the Indian\npeople as a whole\u201d). We do not question the \u201cgeneral trust\nrelationship between the United States and the Indian tribes,\u201d but\nany specific obligations the Government may have under that\nrelationship are \u201cgoverned by statute rather than the common law.\u201dUnited Statesv.Jicarilla Apache Nation, 564\nU.\u00a0S. 162, 165 (2011) . The ISDA and CDA establish a clear\nprocedure for the resolution of disputes over ISDA contracts, with\nan unambiguous 6-year deadline for presentment of claims. The\n\u201cgeneral trust relationship\u201d does not override the clear language\nof those statutes.[5]IVFor these reasons, the judgment of the United\nStates Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit is\naffirmed.It is so ordered.Notes1Because the contract\nclaims accrued no later than the end of each calendar-year\ncontract, the District Court determined, the statute of limitations\nfor the 1996, 1997, and 1998 contracts had run by January 1st of\nthe years 2003, 2004, and 2005, respectively. 539 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d\n152, 154, n.\u00a01 (DC 2008). The Tribe does not dispute the\ntiming of accrual before this Court.2Hollandv.Florida, 560 U.\u00a0S. 631 (2010) , is a habeas case, and\nwe have never held that its equitable-tolling test necessarily\napplies outside the habeas context. Nevertheless, because we agree\nthat the Tribe cannot meetHolland\u2019s test, we have no\noccasion to decide whether an even stricter test might apply to a\nnonhabeas case. Nor does the Tribe argue that a more generous test\nthanHolland\u2019s should apply here.3Because we conclude that\nthe Tribe\u2019s mistake of law was not outside its control, we need not\ndecide whether a mistake of law, however reasonable, could ever be\nextraordinary.4The Court of Appeals\nspeculated, without deciding, that such a development might merit\ntolling, but like that court we have no occasion to decide the\nquestion.5Because we hold that\nthere were no extraordinary circumstances, we need not decide\nwhether the Tribe was diligently pursuing its rights. We also need\nnot accept the Tribe\u2019s invitation to assess prejudice to the\nGovernment, because the absence of prejudice to the opposing party\n\u201cis not an independent basis for invoking the doctrine [of\nequitable tolling] and sanctioning deviations from established\nprocedures.\u201dBaldwin County Welcome Centerv.Brown,\n466 U.\u00a0S. 147, 152 (1984) (per curiam). Rather, the\nabsence of prejudice is \u201ca factor to be considered in determining\nwhether the doctrine of equitable tolling should applyonce a\nfactor that might justify such tolling is identified.\u201dIbid.(emphasis added).",
