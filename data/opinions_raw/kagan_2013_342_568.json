We\nconsider here whether that ruling applies retroactively, so that a\nperson whose conviction became final before we decidedPadillacan benefit from it. We conclude that, under the\nprin-ciples set out inTeaguev.Lane,489 U.S.\n288(1989),Padilladoes not have retroactive\neffect.IPetitioner Roselva Chaidez hails from Mexico,\nbut became a lawful permanent resident of the United States in\n1977. About 20 years later, she helped to defraud an automobile\ninsurance company out of $26,000. After federal agents uncovered\nthe scheme, Chaidez pleaded guilty to two counts of mail fraud, in\nviolation of 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71341. The District Court\nsentenced her to four years of probation and ordered her to pay\nrestitution. Chaidez\u2019s conviction became final in 2004.Under federal immigration law, the offenses to\nwhich Chaidez pleaded guilty are \u201caggravated felonies,\u201d subjecting\nher to mandatory removal from this country. See 8\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a71101(a)(43)(M)(i), 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). But\naccording to Chaidez, her attorney never advised her of that fact,\nand at the time of her plea she remained ignorant of it.Immigration officials initiated removal\nproceedings against Chaidez in 2009, after an application she made\nfor citizenship alerted them to her prior conviction. To avoid\nremoval, Chaidez sought to overturn that conviction by filing a\npetition for a writ ofcoram nobisin Federal District\nCourt.[1] She argued that her\nformer attorney\u2019s failure to advise her of the immigration\nconsequences of pleading guilty constituted ineffective assistance\nof counsel under the Sixth Amendment.While Chaidez\u2019s petition was pending, this Court\ndecidedPadilla. Our ruling vindicated Chaidez\u2019s view of the\nSixth Amendment: We held that criminal defense attorneys must\ninform non-citizen clients of the risks of deportation arising from\nguilty pleas. See 559 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 9). But the\nGovernment argued that Chaidez could not benefit fromPadillabecause it announced a \u201cnew rule\u201d and, underTeague, such rules do not apply in collateral challenges to\nalready-final convictions.The District Court determined thatPadilla\u201cdid not announce a new rule forTeaguepurposes,\u201d and therefore should apply to Chaidez\u2019s case. 730 F.\nSupp. 2d 896, 904 (ND Ill. 2010). It then found that Chaidez\u2019s\ncounsel had performed deficiently underPadillaand that\nChaidez suffered prejudice as a result. Accordingly, the court\nvacated Chaidez\u2019s conviction. See No. 03 CR 636\u20136, 2010 WL 3979664\n(ND Ill., Oct. 6, 2010).The United States Court of Appeals for the\nSeventh Circuit reversed, holding thatPadillahad declared\na new rule and so should not apply in a challenge to a final\nconviction. \u201cBeforePadilla,\u201d the Seventh Circuit reasoned,\n\u201cthe [Supreme] Court had never held that the Sixth Amendment\nrequires a criminal defense attorney to provide advice about\nmatters not directly related to [a] client\u2019s criminal prosecution,\u201d\nincluding the risks of deporta-tion. 655 F.3d 684, 693 (2011). And\nstate and lower federal courts had uniformly concluded that an\nattorney neednotgive \u201cadvice concerning [such a]\ncollateral (as opposed to direct) consequenc[e] of a guilty plea.\u201dId., at 690. According to the Seventh Circuit,Padilla\u2019s holding was new because it ran counter to that\nwidely accepted \u201cdistinction between direct and collateral\nconsequences.\u201d 655 F.\u00a03d, at 691. Judge Williams dissented.\nAgreeing with the Third Circuit\u2019s view, she argued thatPadilla\u201cbroke no new ground\u201d because it merely applied\nestablished law about a lawyer\u2019s \u201cduty to consult\u201d with a client.\n655 F.\u00a03d, at 695 (quotingUnited Statesv.Orocio, 645 F.3d 630, 638\u2013639 (CA3 2011) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted)).We granted certiorari, 566 U.\u00a0S. ___\n(2012), to resolve a split among federal and state courts on\nwhetherPadillaapplies retroactively.[2] Holding that it does not, we affirm the Seventh\nCircuit.IITeaguemakes the retroactivity of our\ncriminal procedure decisions turn on whether they are novel. When\nwe announce a \u201cnew rule,\u201d a person whose conviction is already\nfinal may not benefit from the decision in a habeas or similar\nproceeding.[3] Only when we\napply a settled rule may a person avail herself of the decision on\ncollateral review. Here, Chaidez filed hercoram nobispetition five years after her guilty plea became final. Her\nchallenge therefore fails ifPadilladeclared a new\nrule.\u201c[A] case announces a new rule,\u201dTeagueexplained, \u201cwhen it breaks new ground or imposes a new obligation\u201d\non the government. 489 U.\u00a0S., at 301. \u201cTo put it\ndiffer-ently,\u201d we continued, \u201ca case announces a new rule if the\nresult was notdictatedby precedent existing at the time\nthe defendant\u2019s conviction became final.\u201dIbid.And a\nholding is not so dictated, we later stated, unless it would have\nbeen \u201capparent to all reasonable jurists.\u201dLambrixv.Singletary,520 U.S.\n518, 527\u2013528 (1997).But that account has a flipside.Teaguealso made clear that a case doesnot\u201cannounce a new rule,\n[when] it \u2018[is] merely an application of the principle that\ngoverned\u2019\u00a0\u201d a prior decision to a different set of facts. 489\nU.\u00a0S., at 307 (quotingYatesv.Aiken,484 U.S.\n211, 217 (1988)). As Justice Kennedy has explained, \u201c[w]here\nthe beginning point\u201d of our analysis is a rule of \u201cgeneral\napplication, a rule designed for the specific purpose of evaluating\na myriad of factual contexts, it will be the infrequent case that\nyields a result so novel that it forges a new rule, one not\ndictated by precedent.\u201dWrightv.West,505 U.S.\n277, 309 (1992) (concurring in judgment); see alsoWilliamsv.Taylor,529 U.S.\n362, 391 (2000). Otherwise said, when all we do is apply a\ngeneral standard to the kind of factual circumstances it was meant\nto address, we will rarely state a new rule forTeaguepurposes.Because that is so, garden-variety applications\nof the test inStricklandv.Washington,466 U.S.\n668(1984), for assessing claims of ineffective assistance of\ncounsel do not produce new rules. InStrickland, we held\nthat legal representation violates the Sixth Amendment if it falls\n\u201cbelow an objective standard of reasonableness,\u201d as indicated by\n\u201cprevailing professional norms,\u201d and the defendant suffers\nprejudice as a result.Id., at 687\u2013688. That standard, we\nlater concluded, \u201cprovides sufficient guidance for resolving\nvirtually all\u201d claims of ineffective assistance, even though their\nparticular circumstances will differ.Williams, 529\nU.\u00a0S., at 391. And so we have granted relief underStricklandin diverse contexts without ever suggesting that\ndoing so required a new rule. See,e.g.,ibid.;Rompillav.Beard,545 U.S.\n374(2005);Wigginsv.Smith,539 U.S.\n510(2003).[4] In like\nmanner,Padillawould not have created a new rule had it\nonly appliedStrickland\u2019s general standard to yet another\nfactual situation\u2014that is, hadPadillamerely made clear\nthat a lawyer who neglects to inform a client about the risk of\ndeportation is professionally incompetent.ButPadilladid something more. Before\ndeciding if failing to provide such advice \u201cfell below an objective\nstan-dard of reasonableness,\u201dPadillaconsidered a threshold\nquestion: Was advice about deportation \u201ccategorically removed\u201d from\nthe scope of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel because it\ninvolved only a \u201ccollateral consequence\u201d of a conviction, rather\nthan a component of the criminal sentence? 559 U.\u00a0S., at ___\n(slip op., at 7\u20139).[5] In other\nwords, prior to askinghowtheStricklandtest\napplied (\u201cDid this attorney act unreasonably?\u201d),PadillaaskedwhethertheStricklandtest applied (\u201cShould we\neven evaluate if this attorney acted unreasonably?\u201d). And as we\nwill describe, that preliminary question aboutStrickland\u2019s\nambit came to thePadillaCourt unsettled\u2014so that the\nCourt\u2019s answer (\u201cYes,Stricklandgoverns here\u201d) required a\nnew rule.The relevant background begins with our decision\ninHillv.Lockhart,474 U.S.\n52(1985), which explicitly left open whether advice concerning\na collateral consequence must satisfy Sixth Amendment requirements.\nHill pleaded guilty to first-degree murder after his attorney\nmisinformed him about his parole eligibility. In addressing his\nclaim of ineffective assistance, we first held that theStricklandstandard extends generally to the plea process.\nSeeHill, 474 U.\u00a0S., at 57. We then determined,\nhowever, that Hill had failed to allege prejudice from the lawyer\u2019s\nerror and so could not prevail under that standard. Seeid.,\nat 60. That conclusion allowed us to avoid another, more\ncategorical question: whether advice about parole (however\ninadequate and prejudicial) could possibly violate the Sixth\nAmendment. The Court of Appeals, we noted, had held \u201cthat parole\neligibility is a collateral rather than a direct consequence of a\nguilty plea, of which a defendant need not be informed.\u201dId., at 55. But our ruling on prejudice made \u201cit unnecessary\nto determine whether there may be circumstances under which\u201d ad-\nvice about a matter deemed collateral violates the Sixth Amendment.Id., at 60.[6]That non-decision left the state and lower\nfederal courts to deal with the issue; and they almost unanimously\nconcluded that the Sixth Amendment does not require attorneys to\ninform their clients of a conviction\u2019s collateral consequences,\nincluding deportation. All 10 federal appellate courts to consider\nthe question decided, in the words of one, that \u201ccounsel\u2019s failure\nto inform a defendant of the collateral consequences of a guilty\nplea is never\u201d a violation of the Sixth Amendment.Santos-Sanchezv.United States, 548 F.3d 327,\n334 (CA5 2008).[7] That\nconstitutional guarantee, another typical decision expounded,\n\u201cassures an accused of effective assistance of counsel in\n\u2018criminal prosecutions\u2019\u00a0\u201d; accordingly, advice about\nmatters like de- portation, which are \u201cnot a part of or enmeshed in\nthe criminal proceeding,\u201d does not fall within the Amendment\u2019s\nscope.United Statesv.George, 869 F.2d 333, 337\n(CA7 1989). Appellate courts in almost 30 States agreed.[8] By contrast, only two state courts\nheld that an attorney could violate the Sixth Amendment by failing\nto inform a client about deportation risks or other collateral\nconsequences of a guilty plea.[9] That imbalance led the authors of the principal\nscholarly article on the subject to call the exclusion of advice\nabout collateral consequences from the Sixth Amendment\u2019s scope one\nof \u201cthe most widely recognized rules of American law.\u201d Chin &\nHolmes, Effective Assistance of Counsel and the Consequences of\nGuilty Pleas, 87 Cornell L. Rev. 697, 706 (2002).[10]So when we decidedPadilla, we answered a\nquestion about the Sixth Amendment\u2019s reach that we had left open,\nin a way that altered the law of most jurisdictions\u2014and our\nreasoning reflected that we were doing as much. In the normalStricklandcase, a court begins by evaluating the\nreasonableness of an attorney\u2019s conduct in light of professional\nnorms, and then assesses prejudice. But as earlier indicated, seesupra,at 5\u20136,Padillahad a different starting\npoint. Before asking whether the performance of Padilla\u2019s attorney\nwas deficient underStrickland, we considered (in a\nseparately numbered part of the opinion) whetherStricklandapplied at all. See 559 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 7\u20139). Many\ncourts, we acknowledged, had excluded advice about collateral\nmatters from the Sixth Amendment\u2019s ambit; and deportation, because\nthe consequence of a distinct civil proceeding, could well be\nviewed as such a matter. Seeid.,at ___ (slip op., at 7).\nBut, we continued, no decision of our own committed us to \u201cappl[y]\na distinction between direct and collateral consequences to define\nthe scope\u201d of the right to counsel.Id.,at ___ (slip op.,\nat 8). And however apt that distinction might be in other contexts,\nit should not exempt from Sixth Amendment scrutiny a lawyer\u2019s\nadvice (or non-advice) about a plea\u2019s deportation risk.\nDeportation, we stated, is \u201cunique.\u201dIbid.It is a\n\u201cparticularly severe\u201d penalty, and one \u201cintimately related to the\ncriminal process\u201d; indeed, immigration statutes make it \u201cnearly an\nautomatic result\u201d of some convictions.Ibid.We thus\nresolved the threshold question before us by breaching the\npreviously chink-free wall between direct and collateral\nconsequences: Notwithstanding the then-dominant view,\n\u201cStricklandapplies to Padilla\u2019s claim.\u201dId., at ___\n(slip op., at 9).If that does not count as \u201cbreak[ing] new\nground\u201d or \u201cimpos[ing] a new obligation,\u201d we are hard pressed to\nknow what would.Teague, 489 U.\u00a0S., at 301. BeforePadilla,we had declined to decide whether the Sixth\nAmendment had any relevance to a lawyer\u2019s advice about matters not\npart of a criminal proceeding. Perhaps some advice of that kind\nwould have to meetStrickland\u2019s reasonableness standard\u2014but\nthen again, perhaps not: No precedent of our own \u201cdictated\u201d\nthe answer.Teague, 489 U.\u00a0S., at 301. And as the lower\ncourts filled the vacuum, they almost uniformly insisted on whatPadillacalled the \u201ccategorica[l] remov[al]\u201d of advice about\na conviction\u2019s non-criminal consequences\u2014including deportation\u2014from\nthe Sixth Amendment\u2019s scope. 559 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at\n9). It wasPadillathat first rejected that categorical\napproach\u2014and so made theStricklandtest operative\u2014when a\ncriminal lawyer gives (or fails to give) advice about immigration\nconsequences.[11] In\nacknowledging that fact, we do not cast doubt on, or at all\ndenigrate,Padilla. Courts often need to, and do, break new\nground; it is the very premise ofTeaguethat a decision can\nbe right and also be novel. All we say here is thatPadilla\u2019s holding that the failure to advise about a\nnon-criminal consequence could violate the Sixth Amendment would\nnot have been\u2014in fact, was not\u2014\u201capparent to all reasonable jurists\u201d\nprior to our decision.Lambrix, 520 U.\u00a0S., at 527\u2013528.Padillathus announced a \u201cnew rule.\u201dIIIChaidez offers, and the dissent largely\nadopts, a different account ofPadilla, in which we did no\nmore than applyStricklandto a new set of facts. On\nChaidez\u2019s view,Stricklandinsisted \u201c[f]rom its inception\u201d\nthatallaspects of a criminal lawyer\u2019s performance pass a\ntest of \u201c\u00a0\u2018reasonableness under prevailing professional\nnorms\u2019\u00a0\u201d: The decision thus foreclosed any \u201ccategorical\ndistinction between direct and collateral consequences.\u201d Brief for\nPetitioner 21\u201322 (emphasis deleted) (quotingStrickland, 466\nU.\u00a0S., at 688). Indeed, Chaidez contends, courts prior toPadillarecognizedStrickland\u2019s all-encompassing\nscope and so applied its reasonableness standard to advice\nconcerning deportation. See Brief for Petitioner 25\u201326; Reply Brief\n10\u201312. She here points to caselaw in three federal appeals courts\nallowing ineffective assistance claims when attorneys affirmatively\nmisled their clients about the deportation consequences of guilty\npleas.[12] The only question\nleft forPadillato resolve, Chaidez claims, was whether\nprofessional norms also require criminal lawyers to volunteer\nadvice about the risk of deportation. In addressing that issue, she\ncontinues,Padilladid a run-of-the-millStricklandanalysis. And more: It did an especially easyStricklandanalysis. We had earlier noted inINSv.St. Cyr,533 U.S.\n289(2001)\u2014a case raising an issue of immigration law unrelated\nto the Sixth Amendment\u2014that a \u201ccompetent defense counsel\u201d would\ninform his client about a guilty plea\u2019s deportation consequences.Id., at 323, n. 50. AllPadillahad to do, Chaidez\nconcludes, was recite that prior finding.But Chaidez\u2019s (and the dissent\u2019s) story line is\nwrong, for reasons we have mostly already noted:Padillahad\nto develop new law, establishing that the Sixth Amendment applied\nat all, before it could assess the performance of Padilla\u2019s lawyer\nunderStrickland. Seesupra,at 5\u20136, 9. Our first\norder of business was thus to consider whether the widely accepted\ndistinction between direct and collateral consequences\ncategorically foreclosed Padilla\u2019s claim, whatever the level of his\nattorney\u2019s performance. We did not think, as Chaidez argues, thatStricklandbarred resort to that distinction. Far from it:\nEven inPadillawe did not eschew the direct-collateral\ndivide across the board. See 559 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at\n8) (\u201cWhether that distinction is [generally] appropriate is a\nquestion we need not consider in this case\u201d). Rather, we relied on\nthe special \u201cnature of deportation\u201d\u2014the severity of the penalty and\nthe \u201cautomatic\u201d way it follows from conviction\u2014to show that \u201c[t]he\ncollateral versus direct distinction [was] ill-suited\u201d to dispose\nof Padilla\u2019s claim.Id., at ___ (slip op., at 8\u20139). All that\nreasoning came before we conducted aStricklandanalysis (by\nexamining professional norms and so forth), and none of it followed\nineluctably from prior law.[13]Predictably, then, the caselaw Chaidez and the\ndissent cite fails to support their claim that lower courts\n\u201caccepted thatStricklandapplied to deportation advice.\u201d\nBrief for Petitioner 25; seepost, at 8\u201311. True enough,\nthree fed- eral circuits (and a handful of state courts) held\nbeforePa-dillathat misstatements about deportation could\nsupport an ineffective assistance claim. But those decisions\nreasoned only that a lawyer may not affirmatively misrepresent his\nexpertise or otherwise actively mislead his client on any important\nmatter, however related to a criminal prosecution. See,e.g.,\nUnited Statesv.Kwan,407 F.3d 1005, 1015\u20131017 (CA9 2005). They co-existed happily\nwith precedent, from the same jurisdictions (and almost all\nothers), holding that deportation is not \u201cso unique as to warrant\nan exception to the general rule that a defendant need not be\nadvised of the [collateral] consequences of a guilty plea.\u201dUnited Statesv.Campbell, 778 F.2d 764, 769 (CA11\n1985).[14] So at most,\nChaidez has shown that a minority of courts recognized a separate\nrule for material misrepresentations, regardless whether they\nconcerned deportation or another collateral matter. That limited\nrule does not apply to Chaidez\u2019s case. And because it lived in\nharmony with the exclusion of claims like hers from the Sixth\nAmendment, it does not establish what she needs to\u2014that all\nreasonable judges, prior toPadilla, thought they were\nliving in aPadilla-like world.Nor, finally, doesSt. Cyrhave any\nrelevance here. That decision stated what is common sense (and what\nwe again recognized inPadilla): A reasonably competent\nlawyer will tell a non-citizen client about a guilty plea\u2019s\ndeportation consequences because \u201c\u00a0\u2018[p]reserving the client\u2019s\nright to remain in the United States may be more important to the\nclient than any potential jail sentence.\u2019\u00a0\u201dPadilla,\n559 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 10) (quotingSt. Cyr,\n533 U.\u00a0S., at 322). But in saying that much,St. Cyrdid not determine that the Sixth Amendment requires a lawyer to\nprovide such information. Courts had held to the contrary not\nbecause advice about deportation was insignificant to a\nclient\u2014really, who could think that, whether before or afterSt.\nCyr?\u2014but because it concerned a matter collateral to the\ncriminal prosecution.[15] On\nthose courts\u2019 view, the Sixth Amendment no more demanded competent\nadvice about a plea\u2019s deportation consequences than it demanded\ncompetent representation in the deportation process itself.Padilladecided that view was wrong. But to repeat: It wasPadillathat did so. In the years followingSt. Cyr,\nnot a single state or lower federal court considering a lawyer\u2019s\nfailure to provide deportation advice abandoned the distinction\nbetween direct and collateral consequences, and several courts\nreaffirmed that divide. See,e.g.,Santos-Sanchez,\n548 F.\u00a03d, at 335\u2013336;Broomesv.Ashcroft,358 F.3d 1251, 1256\u20131257 (CA10 2004);United Statesv.Fry,322 F.3d 1198, 1200\u20131201 (CA9 2003). It tookPadillato\ndecide that in assessing such a lawyer\u2019s performance, the Sixth\nAmendment sets the standard.[16]IVThis Court announced a new rule inPadilla. UnderTeague, defendants whose convictions\nbecame final prior toPadillatherefore cannot benefit from\nits holding. We accordingly affirm the judgment of the Court of\nAppeals for the Seventh Circuit.It is so ordered.Notes1A petition for a writ ofcoram nobisprovides a way to collaterally attack a criminal\nconviction for a person, like Chaidez, who is no longer \u201cin\ncustody\u201d and therefore cannot seek habeas relief under 28\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72255 or \u00a72241. SeeUnited Statesv.Morgan,346 U.S.\n502, 507, 510\u2013511 (1954). Chaidez and the Government agree that\nnothing in this case turns on the difference between acoram\nnobispetition and a habeas petition, and we assume without\ndeciding that they are correct.2Compare 655 F.3d 684 (CA7\n2011) (case below) (not retroactive);United Statesv.Amer, 681 F.3d 211 (CA5 2012) (same);United Statesv.Chang Hong, 671 F.3d 1147 (CA10 2011) (same);Statev.Gaitan, 209 N.\u00a0J. 339, 37 A.3d 1089\n(2012) (same), withUnited Statesv.Orocio, 645 F.3d\n630 (CA3 2011) (retroactive);Commonwealthv.Clarke,\n460 Mass. 30, 949 N.E.2d 892 (2011) (same).3Teaguestated two\nexceptions: \u201c[W]atershed rules of criminal procedure\u201d and rules\nplacing \u201cconduct beyond the power of the [government] to proscribe\u201d\napply on collateral review, even if novel. 489 U.\u00a0S., at 311\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Chaidez does not argue that\neither of those exceptions is relevant here.4We did not considerTeagueinWilliams,Rompilla, andWiggins,but we granted habeas relief pursuant to 28\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72254(d)(1) because state courts had\nunreasonably applied \u201cclearly established\u201d law. And, as we have\nexplained, \u201cclearly established\u201d law is not \u201cnew\u201d within the\nmeaning ofTeague.

We instead point to thepresenceof lower court authority\u2014in case after case and\njurisdiction after jurisdiction\u2014holding that such a failure,\nbecause relating to a collateral matter, could not do\nso.11The\nseparate opinions inPadillaobjected to just this aspect of\nthe Court\u2019s ruling. Dissents have been known to exaggerate the\nnoveltyof majority opinions; and \u201cthe mere existence of a dissent,\u201d\nlike the existence of conflicting authority in state or lower\nfederal courts, does not establish that a rule is new.Beardv.Banks,542 U.S.\n406, 416, n.\u00a05 (2004); seeWilliams, 529\nU.\u00a0S., at 410. But the concurring and dissenting opinions inPadillawere on to something when they described the line\nthe Court was crossing. \u201cUntil today,\u201d Justice Alito wrote, \u201cthe\nlongstanding and unanimous position of the federal courts was that\nreasonable defense counsel generally need only advise a client\nabout thedirectconsequences of a criminal conviction.\u201d See\n559 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 2).\nOr again, this time from Justice Scalia: \u201c[U]ntil today,\u201d the Sixth\nAmendment guaranteed only \u201clegal advice directly related to defense\nagainst prosecution\u201d of a criminal charge.Id., at ___\n(dissenting) (slip op., at 2). One need not agree with any of the\nseparate opinions\u2019 criticisms ofPadillato concur with\ntheir view that it modified governing law.12SeeUnited Statesv.Kwan,407 F.3d 1005, 1015\u20131017 (CA9 2005);United Statesv.Couto,311 F.3d 179, 188 (CA2 2002);Downs-Morganv.United\nStates, 765 F.2d 1534, 1540\u20131541 (CA11 1985).13The\ndissent\u2019s entire analysis founders on this most basic point. In its\nlengthy description ofPadilla, the dissent picks up in the\nmiddle\u2014afterthe Court concluded that the direct-collateral\ndistinction did not preclude finding that Padilla\u2019s lawyer provided\nineffective assistance under the Sixth Amendment. Seepost,\nat 3\u20135. The dissent justifies ignoring that threshold conclusion on\nthe ground that \u201cPadilladeclined to embrace the\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. distinction between collateral and direct\nconsequences\u201d and \u201cstated very clearly that it found the\ndistinction irrelevant\u201d to the case.Post, at 6. But it is\nexactly in refusing to apply the direct-collateral distinction that\nthePadillaCourt did something novel. Before then, as the\nCourt forthrightly acknowledged, that distinction would have doomed\nPadilla\u2019s claim in well-nigh every court in the United States. See\n559 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 7);supra,at\n9.14See\nalsoResendizv.Kovensky,416 F.3d 952, 957 (CA9 2005) (\u201c[B]ecause immigration\nconsequences remain collateral, the failure of counsel to advise\nhis client of the potential immigration consequences of a\nconviction does not violate the Sixth Amendment\u201d);Russov.United States, 1999 WL 164951, *2 (\u201c[C]ounsel cannot be\nfound ineffective for the mere failure to inform a defendant of the\ncollateral consequences of a plea, such as deportation\u201d) (relying\nonUnited Statesv.Santelises, 509 F.2d 703, 704\n(CA2 1975) (per curiam)).15The\ndissent claims the opposite, averring that lower court \u201cdecisions\nshow nothing more than that the underlying professional norms had\nnot yet evolved to require attorneys to provide advice about\ndeportation consequences.\u201dPost, at 8. But the dissent\ncannot point to a single decision stating that a lawyer\u2019s failure\nto offer advice about deportation met professional norms; all the\ndecisions instead held that a lawyer\u2019s breach of those norms was\nconstitutionally irrelevant because deportation was a collateral\nconsequence. Seesupra,at 7. Had courts in fact considered\nprofessional standards in the slew of cases beforePadillathat presentedPadilla-like claims, they would have\ndiscovered as early as 1968 that the American Bar Association\ninstructed criminal lawyers to advise their non-citizen clients\nabout the risks of deportation. See 3 ABA Project on Standards for\nCriminal Justice, Standards Relating to Pleas of Guilty \u00a73.2(b),\nCommentary,p. 71 (App. Draft 1968). The difficulty in upholding\nsuch claims prior toPadillahad nothing to do with courts\u2019\nview of professional norms and everything to do with their use of\nthe direct-collateral divide.16Chaidez makes two back-up arguments\nin her merits briefs\u2014thatTeague\u2019s bar on retroactivity does\nnot apply when a petitioner chal-lenges a federal conviction, or at\nleast does not do so when she makes a claim of ineffective\nassistance. Brief for Petitioner 27\u201339. But Chaidez did not include\nthose issues in her petition for certiorari. Nor, still more\ncritically, did she adequately raise them in the lower courts. Only\nher petition for rehearing en banc in the Seventh Circuit at all\nquestionedTeague\u2019s applicability, and her argument\nthere\u2014that a \u201cTeague-light\u201d standard should apply to\nchallenges to federal convictions\u2014differs from the ones she has\nmade in this Court. See Petition for Rehearing and for Rehearing En\nBanc in No. 10\u20133623 (CA7), p. 13. Moreover, we cannot find any case\nin which a federal court has considered Chaidez\u2019s contention thatTeagueshould not apply to ineffective assistance claims.\n\u201c[M]indful that we are a court of review, not of first view,\u201d we\ndecline to rule on Chaidez\u2019s new arguments.Cutterv.Wilkinson,544 U.S.\n709, 718, n.\u00a07 (2005).",
