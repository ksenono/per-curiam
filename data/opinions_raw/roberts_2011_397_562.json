S. ____ (2011)SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESNO. 09-1279FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION, et\u00a0al.,\nPETITIONERSv.AT&T INC. et\u00a0al.on writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the third circuit[March 1, 2011]Chief Justice Roberts delivered\nthe opinion of the Court.The Freedom of Information Act\nrequires federal agencies to make records and documents publicly\navailable upon request, unless they fall within one of several\nstatutory exemptions. One of those exemptions covers law\nenforcement records, the disclosure of which \u201ccould reasonably be\nexpected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal\nprivacy.\u201d 5 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7552(b)(7)(C). The question presented is\nwhether corporations have \u201cpersonal privacy\u201d for the purposes of\nthis exemption.IThe Freedom of Information Act\nrequest at issue in this case relates to an investigation of\nrespondent AT&T Inc., conducted by the Federal Communications\nCommission. AT&T participated in an FCC-administered\nprogram\u2014the E-Rate (or Education-Rate) program\u2014that was created to\nenhance access for schools and libraries to advanced\ntelecommunications and information services. In August 2004,\nAT&T voluntarily reported to the FCC that it might have\novercharged the Government for services it provided as part of the\nprogram.The FCC\u2019s Enforcement Bureau\nlaunched an investigation. As part of that investigation, AT&T\nprovided the Bureau various documents, including responses to\ninterrogatories, invoices, emails with pricing and billing\ninformation, names and job descriptions of employees involved, and\nAT&T\u2019s assessment of whether those employees had violated the\ncompany\u2019s code of conduct. 582 F.\u00a03d 490, 492\u2013493 (CA3 2009).\nThe FCC and AT&T resolved the matter in December 2004 through a\nconsent decree in which AT&T\u2014without conceding liability\u2014agreed\nto pay the Government $500,000 and to institute a plan to ensure\ncompliance with the program. See 19 FCC Rcd. 24014,\n24016\u201324019.Several months later, CompTel\u2014\u201ca trade\nassociation representing some of AT&T\u2019s competitors\u201d\u2014submitted\na FOIA request seeking \u201c\u00a0\u2018[a]ll pleadings and\ncorrespondence\u2019\u00a0\u201d in the Bureau\u2019s file on the AT&T\ninvestigation. 582 F.\u00a03d, at 493. AT&T opposed CompTel\u2019s\nrequest, and the Bureau issued a letter-ruling in response.The Bureau concluded that some of the\ninformation AT&T had provided (including cost and pricing data,\nbilling-related information, and identifying information about\nstaff, contractors, and customer representatives) should be\nprotected from disclosure under FOIA Exemption 4, which relates to\n\u201ctrade secrets and commercial or financial information,\u201d 5 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a7552(b)(4). App. to Pet. for Cert. 40a\u201341a. The Bureau\nalso decided to withhold other information under FOIA Exemption\n7(C). Exemption 7(C) exempts \u201crecords or information compiled for\nlaw enforcement purposes\u201d that \u201ccould reasonably be expected to\nconstitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\u201d\n\u00a7552(b)(7)(C). The Bureau concluded that \u201cindividuals identified in\n[AT&T\u2019s] submissions\u201d have \u201cprivacy rights\u201d that warrant\nprotection under Exemption 7(C).Id., at 43a. The Bureau\ndid not, however, apply that exemption to the corporation itself,\nreasoning that \u201cbusinesses do not possess \u2018personal privacy\u2019\ninterests as required\u201d by the exemption.Id.,at\n42a\u201343a.On review the FCC agreed with the Bureau. The\nCommission found AT&T\u2019s position that it is \u201ca \u2018private\ncorporate citizen\u2019 with personal privacy rights that should be\nprotected from disclosure that would \u2018embarrass\u2019 it \u2026 within the\nmeaning of Exemption 7(C) \u2026 at odds with established [FCC] and\njudicial precedent.\u201d 23 FCC Rcd. 13704, 13707 (2008). It therefore\nconcluded that \u201cExemption 7(C) has no applicability to corporations\nsuch as [AT&T].\u201dId.,at 13710.AT&T sought review in the Court of Appeals\nfor the Third Circuit, and that court rejected the FCC\u2019s reasoning.\nNoting that Congress had defined the word \u201cperson\u201d to include\ncorporations as well as individuals, 5 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7551(2), the\ncourt held that Exemption 7(C) extends to the \u201cpersonal privacy\u201d of\ncorporations, since \u201cthe root from which the statutory word\n[personal] \u2026 is derived\u201d is the defined term \u201cperson.\u201d 582\nF.\u00a03d, at 497. As the court explained, \u201c[i]t would be very odd\nindeed for an adjectival form of a defined term not to refer back\nto that defined term.\u201dIbid.The court accordingly ruled\n\u201cthat FOIA\u2019s text unambiguously indicates that a corporation may\nhave a \u2018personal privacy\u2019 interest within the meaning of Exemption\n7(C).\u201dId.,at 498.The FCC petitioned this Court for review of\nthe Third Circuit\u2019s decision and CompTel filed as a respondent\nsupporting petitioners. We granted certiorari, 561 U. S. ___\n(2010), and now reverse.IILike the Court of Appeals below,\nAT&T relies on the argument that the word \u201cpersonal\u201d in\nExemption 7(C) incorporates the statutory definition of the word\n\u201cperson.\u201d See Brief for Respondent AT&T 8\u20139, 14\u201315 (AT&T\nBrief); 582 F.\u00a03d, at 497. The Administrative Procedure Act\ndefines \u201cperson\u201d to include \u201can individual, partnership,\ncorporation, association, or public or private organization other\nthan an agency.\u201d 5 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7551(2). Because that definition\napplies here, the argument goes, \u201cpersonal\u201d must mean relating to\nthose \u201cperson[s]\u201d: namely, corporations and other entities as well\nas individuals. This reading, we are told, is dictated by a \u201cbasic\nprinciple of grammar and usage.\u201d AT&T Brief 8; seeid.,at 14\u201315; see also 582 F.\u00a03d, at 497 (citingDelaware River Stevedoresv.DiFidelto, 440\nF.\u00a03d 615, 623 (CA3 2006) (Fisher, J., concurring), for \u201c[t]he\ngrammatical imperativ[e]\u201d that \u201ca statute which defines a noun has\nthereby defined the adjectival form of that noun\u201d). According to\nAT&T, \u201c[b]y expressly defining the noun \u2018person\u2019 to include\ncorporations, Congressnecessarilydefined the adjective\nform of that noun\u2014\u2018personal\u2019\u2014also to include corporations.\u201d\nAT&T Brief 14 (emphasis added).We disagree. Adjectives typically\nreflect the meaning of corresponding nouns, but not always.\nSometimes they acquire distinct meanings of their own. The noun\n\u201ccrab\u201d refers variously to a crustacean and a type of apple, while\nthe related adjective \u201ccrabbed\u201d can refer to handwriting that is\n\u201cdifficult to read,\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary\n527 (2002); \u201ccorny\u201d can mean \u201cusing familiar and stereotyped\nformulas believed to appeal to the unsophisticated,\u201did.,at 509, which has little to do with \u201ccorn,\u201did.,at 507\n(\u201cthe seeds of any of the cereal grasses used for food\u201d); and while\n\u201ccrank\u201d is \u201ca part of an axis bent at right angles,\u201d \u201ccranky\u201d can\nmean \u201cgiven to fretful fussiness,\u201did.,at 530.Even in cases such as these there may well be\na link between the noun and the adjective. \u201cCranky\u201d describes a\nperson with a \u201cwayward\u201d or \u201ccapricious\u201d temper, see 3 Oxford\nEnglish Dictionary 1117 (2d ed. 1989) (OED), which might bear some\nrelation to the distorted or crooked angular shape from which a\n\u201ccrank\u201d takes its name. That is not the point. What is significant\nis that, in ordinary usage, a noun and its adjective form may have\nmeanings as disparate as any two unrelated words. The FCC\u2019s\nargument that \u201cpersonal\u201d does not, in fact, derive from the English\nword \u201cperson,\u201d but instead developed along its own etymological\npath, Reply Brief for Petitioners 6, simply highlights the\nshortcomings of AT&T\u2019s proposed rule.\u201cPerson\u201d is a defined term in the statute;\n\u201cpersonal\u201d is not. When a statute does not define a term, we\ntypically \u201cgive the phrase its ordinary meaning.\u201dJohnsonv.United States, 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at\n4). \u201cPersonal\u201d ordinarily refers to individuals. We do not usually\nspeak of personal characteristics, personal effects, personal\ncorrespondence, personal influence, or personal tragedy as\nreferring to corporations or other artificial entities. This is not\nto say that corporations do not have correspondence, influence, or\ntragedies of their own, only that we do not use the word \u201cpersonal\u201d\nto describe them.Certainly, if the chief executive officer of a\ncorporation approached the chief financial officer and said, \u201cI\nhave something personal to tell you,\u201d we would not assume the CEO\nwas about to discuss company business. Responding to a request for\ninformation, an individual might say, \u201cthat\u2019s personal.\u201d A company\nspokesman, when asked for information about the company, would not.\nIn fact, we often use the word \u201cpersonal\u201d to mean precisely theoppositeof business-related: We speak of personal\nexpenses and business expenses, personal life and work life,\npersonal opinion and a company\u2019s view.Dictionaries also suggest that \u201cpersonal\u201d does\nnot ordinarily relate to artificial \u201cpersons\u201d such as corporations.\nSee,e.g.,7 OED 726 (1933) (\u201c[1] [o]f, pertaining to \u2026\nthe individual person or self,\u201d \u201cindividual; private; one\u2019s own,\u201d\n\u201c[3] [o]f or pertaining to one\u2019s person, body, or figure,\u201d \u201c[5]\n[o]f, pertaining to, or characteristic of a person or\nself-conscious being, as opposed to a thing or abstraction\u201d); 11\nOED at 599\u2013600 (2d ed. 1989) (same); Webster\u2019s Third New\nInternational Dictionary 1686 (1976) (\u201c[3] relating to the person\nor body\u201d; \u201c[4] relating to an individual, his character, conduct,\nmotives, or private affairs\u201d; \u201c[5] relating to or characteristic of\nhuman beings as distinct from things\u201d);ibid. (2002)\n(same).AT&T dismisses these definitions,\ncorrectly noting that \u201cpersonal\u201d\u2014at its most basic level\u2014simply\nmeans \u201c[o]f or pertaining to a particular person.\u201d Webster\u2019s New\nInternational Dictionary 1828 (2d ed. 1954). The company\nacknowledges that \u201cin non-legal usage, where a \u2018person\u2019 is a human\nbeing, it is entirely unsurprising that the word \u2018personal\u2019 is used\nto refer to human beings.\u201d AT&T Brief 8. But in a watered-down\nversion of the \u201cgrammatical imperative\u201d argument, AT&T contends\nthat \u201cperson\u201d\u2014in commonlegalusage\u2014is understood to\ninclude a corporation. \u201cPersonal\u201d in the same context therefore can\nand should have the same scope, especially here in light of the\nstatutory definition. Seeid., at 8\u20139, 16.The construction of statutory language often\nturns on context, see,e.g.,Johnson,supra,at ___ (slip op., at 5), which certainly may\ninclude the definitions of related words. But here the context to\nwhich AT&T points does not dissuade us from the ordinary\nmeaning of \u201cpersonal.\u201d We have no doubt that \u201cperson,\u201d in a legal\nsetting, often refers to artificial entities. The Dictionary Act\nmakes that clear. 1 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71 (defining \u201cperson\u201d to include\n\u201ccorporations, companies, associations, firms, partnerships,\nsocieties, and joint stock companies, as well as individuals\u201d). But\nAT&T\u2019s effort to ascribe a corresponding legal meaning to\n\u201cpersonal\u201d again elides the difference between \u201cperson\u201d and\n\u201cpersonal.\u201dWhen it comes to the word \u201cpersonal,\u201d there is\nlittle support for the notion that it denotes corporations, even in\nthe legal context. AT&T notes that corporations are \u201cprotected\nby the doctrine of \u2018personal\u2019 jurisdiction,\u201d AT&T Brief 19, but\nthat phrase refers to jurisdictionin personam, as opposed\ntoin rem, not the jurisdiction \u201cof a person.\u201d The only\nother example AT&T cites is an 1896 case that referred to the\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018personal privilege\u2019\u00a0\u201d of a corporation.Ibid.(quotingMercantile Bankv.Tennessee ex rel.\nMemphis,161 U.\nS. 161, 171 (1896) (emphasis deleted)). These examples fall far\nshort of establishing that \u201cpersonal\u201d here has a legal meaning\napart from its ordinary one, even if \u201cperson\u201d does. Cf.Merck\n& Co.v.Reynolds, 559 U. S. ___, ___\u2013___ (2010)\n(slip op., at 8\u201310) (noting that \u201c\u00a0\u2018discovery\u2019 is often used\nas a term of art in connection with the \u2018discovery rule\u2019\u00a0\u201d and\ndescribing the judicial and legislative codification of that\nmeaning over time);Molzofv.United States,502 U. S. 301,\n306 (1992) (\u201c\u00a0\u2018Punitive damages\u2019 is a legal term of art that\nhas a widely accepted common-law meaning \u2026 this Court\u2019s decisions\nmake clear that the concept \u2026 has a long pedigree in the law\u201d).Regardless of whether \u201cpersonal\u201d can carry a\nspecial meaning in legal usage, \u201cwhen interpreting a statute \u2026 we\nconstrue language \u2026 in light of the terms surrounding it.\u201dLeocalv.Ashcroft,543 U. S. 1, 9 (2004).\nExemption 7(C) refers not just to the word \u201cpersonal,\u201d but to the\nterm \u201cpersonal privacy.\u201d \u00a7552(b)(7)(C); cf.Textron Lycoming\nReciprocating Engine Div., AVCO Corp.v.Automobile\nWorkers,523 U.\nS. 653, 657 (1998) (\u201cIt is not the meaning of \u2018for\u2019 we are\nseeking here, but the meaning of \u2018[s]uits for violation of\ncontracts\u2019\u00a0\u201d). AT&T\u2019s effort to attribute a special legal\nmeaning to the word \u201cpersonal\u201d in this particular context is wholly\nunpersuasive.AT&T\u2019s argument treats the term \u201cpersonal\nprivacy\u201d as simply the sum of its two words: the privacy of a\nperson. Under that view, the defined meaning of the noun \u201cperson,\u201d\nor the asserted specialized legal meaning, takes on greater\nsignificance. But two words together may assume a more particular\nmeaning than those words in isolation. We understand a golden cup\nto be a cup made of or resembling gold. A golden boy, on the other\nhand, is one who is charming, lucky, and talented. A golden\nopportunity is one not to be missed. \u201cPersonal\u201d in the phrase\n\u201cpersonal privacy\u201d conveys more than just \u201cof a person.\u201d It\nsuggests a type of privacy evocative of human concerns\u2014not the sort\nusually associated with an entity like, say, AT&T.Despite its contention that \u201c[c]ommon legal\nusage\u201d of the word \u201cperson\u201d supports its reading of the term\n\u201cpersonal privacy,\u201d AT&T Brief 9, 13, 18, AT&T does not\ncite a single instance in which this Court or any other (aside from\nthe Court of Appeals below) has expressly referred to a\ncorporation\u2019s \u201cpersonal privacy.\u201d Nor does it identify any other\nstatute that does so. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 26. On the contrary,\ntreatises in print around the time that Congress drafted the\nexemptions at hand reflect the understanding that the specific\nconcept of \u201cpersonal privacy,\u201d at least as a matter of common law,\ndid not apply to corporations. See Restatement (Second) of Torts\n\u00a7652I, Commentc(1976) (\u201cA corporation, partnership or\nunincorporated association has no personal right of privacy\u201d); W.\nProsser, Law of Torts \u00a797, pp. 641\u2013642 (2d ed. 1955) (\u201cA\ncorporation or a partnership as such can have no personal privacy,\nalthough it seems clear that it may have an exclusive right to its\nname and its business prestige\u201d (footnotes omitted)); cf.id., \u00a7112, at 843\u2013844 (3d ed. 1964) (\u201cIt seems to be\ngenerally agreed that the right of privacy is one pertaining only\nto individuals, and that a corporation or a partnership cannot\nclaim it as such\u201d (footnotes omitted));id., \u00a7117, at 815\n(4th ed. 1971) (same).AT&T contends that this Court has\nrecognized \u201cprivacy\u201d interests of corporations in the Fourth\nAmendment and double jeopardy contexts, and that the term should be\nsimilarly construed here. See AT&T Brief 20\u201325. But this case\ndoes not call upon us to pass on the scope of a corporation\u2019s\n\u201cprivacy\u201d interests as a matter of constitutional or common law.\nThe discrete question before us is instead whether Congress used\nthe term \u201cpersonal privacy\u201d to refer to the privacy of artificial\npersons in FOIA Exemption 7(C); the cases AT&T cites are too\nfar afield to be of help here.AT&T concludes that the FCC has simply\nfailed to demonstrate that the phrase \u201cpersonal privacy\u201d\n\u201cnecessarilyexcludesthe privacy of corporations.\u201dId.,at 31\u201332 (emphasis added). But construing statutory\nlanguage is not merely an exercise in ascertaining \u201cthe outer\nlimits of [a word\u2019s] definitional possibilities,\u201dDolanv.Postal Service,546 U. S. 481, 486\n(2006). AT&T has given us no sound reason in the statutory text\nor context to disregard the ordinary meaning of the phrase\n\u201cpersonal privacy.\u201dIIIThe meaning of \u201cpersonal privacy\u201d\nin Exemption 7(C) is further clarified by the rest of the statute.\nCongress enacted Exemption 7(C) against the backdrop of\npre-existing FOIA exemptions, and the purpose and scope of\nExemption 7(C) becomes even more apparent when viewed in this\ncontext. SeeNkenv.Holder, 556 U. S. ___, ___\n(2009) (slip op., at 6) (\u201cstatutory interpretation turns on \u2018the\nlanguage itself, the specific context in which that language is\nused, and the broader context of the statute as a whole\u2019\u00a0\u201d\n(quotingRobinsonv.Shell Oil Co.,519 U. S. 337, 341\n(1997))). Two of those other exemptions are particularly relevant\nhere.The phrase \u201cpersonal privacy\u201d\nfirst appeared in the FOIA exemptions in Exemption 6, enacted in\n1966, eight years before Congress enacted Exemption 7(C). See 80\nStat. 250, codified as amended at 5 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7552(b)(6).\nExemption 6 covers \u201cpersonnel and medical files and similar files\nthe disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted\ninvasion of personal privacy.\u201d \u00a7552(b)(6). Not only did Congress\nchoose the same term in drafting Exemption 7(C), it also used the\nterm in a nearly identical manner.Although the question whether Exemption 6 is\nlimited to individuals has not come to us directly, we have\nregularly referred to that exemption as involving an \u201cindividual\u2019s\nright of privacy.\u201dDepartment of Statev.Ray,502 U. S. 164,\n175 (1991) (quotingDepartment of Air Forcev.Rose,425\nU. S. 352, 372 (1976) (internal quotation marks omitted)); see\nalsoDepartment of Statev.Washington Post Co.,456 U. S. 595,\n599 (1982).AT&T does not dispute that \u201cidentical\nwords and phrases within the same statute should normally be given\nthe same meaning,\u201dPowerex Corp.v.Reliant Energy\nServices, Inc.,551 U. S. 224, 232\n(2007), but contends that \u201cif Exemption 6 does not protect\ncorporations, it is because [it] applies only to \u2018personnel and\nmedical files and similar files,\u2019\u00a0\u201d not because of the term\n\u201cpersonal privacy.\u201d AT&T Brief 36 (quoting \u00a7552(b)(6)). Yet the\nsignificance of the pertinent phrase\u2014\u201cthe disclosure of which would\nconstitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy,\u201d\n\u00a7552(b)(6)\u2014cannot be so readily dismissed. Without it, Exemption 6\nwould categorically exempt \u201cpersonnel and medical files\u201d as well as\nany \u201csimilar\u201d file. Even if the scope of Exemption 6 is also\nlimited by the types of files it protects, the \u201cpersonal privacy\u201d\nphrase importantly defines the particular subset of that\ninformation Congress sought to exempt. SeeWashington Post\nCo.,supra,at 599. And because Congress used the\nsame phrase in Exemption 7(C), the reach of that phrase in\nExemption 6 is pertinent in construing Exemption 7(C).In drafting Exemption 7(C), Congress did not,\non the other hand, use language similar to that in Exemption 4.\nExemption 4 pertains to \u201ctrade secrets and commercial or financial\ninformation obtained from a person and privileged or confidential.\u201d\n5 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7552(b)(4). This clearly applies to corporations\u2014it\nuses the defined term \u201cperson\u201d to describe the source of the\ninformation\u2014and we far more readily think of corporations as having\n\u201cprivileged or confidential\u201d documents than personally private\nones. So at the time Congress enacted Exemption 7(C), it had in\nplace an exemption that plainly covered a corporation\u2019s commercial\nand financial information, and another that we have described as\nrelating to \u201cindividuals.\u201d The language of Exemption 7(C) tracks\nthe latter.The Government has long interpreted the phrase\n\u201cpersonal privacy\u201d in Exemption 7(C) accordingly. Shortly after\nCongress passed the 1974 amendments that enacted Exemption 7(C),\nthe Attorney General issued a memorandum to executive departments\nand agencies explaining that \u201cpersonal privacy\u201d in that exemption\n\u201cpertains to the privacy interests of individuals.\u201d U. S. Dept. of\nJustice, Attorney General\u2019s Memorandum on the 1974 Amendments to\nthe Freedom of Information Act 9, reprinted in House Committee on\nGovernment Operations and Senate Committee on the Judiciary,\nFreedom of Information Act and Amendments of 1974 (P. L. 93\u2013502),\n94th Cong., 1st Sess., 507, 579 (Jt. Comm. Print 1975). The\nexemption, the Attorney General noted, \u201cdoes not seem applicable to\ncorporations or other entities.\u201dIbid. We have previously\nviewed this Memorandum as a reliable guide in interpreting FOIA,\nseeNational Archives and Records Admin.v.Favish,541\nU. S. 157, 169 (2004);FBIv.Abramson,456 U. S. 615,\n622, n. 5 (1982), and we agree with its conclusion here.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*We reject the argument that\nbecause \u201cperson\u201d is defined for purposes of FOIA to include a\ncorporation, the phrase \u201cpersonal privacy\u201d in Exemption 7(C)\nreaches corporations as well. The protection in FOIA against\ndisclosure of law enforcement information on the ground that it\nwould constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy does\nnot extend to corporations. We trust that AT&T will not take it\npersonally.The judgment of the Court of\nAppeals is reversed.It is so ordered.Justice Kagan took no part in the\nconsideration or decision of this case.",
