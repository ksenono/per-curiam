SULYMAon writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the ninth circuit[February 26, 2020]Justice Alito delivered the opinion of the\nCourt.The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of\n1974 (ERISA) requires plaintiffs with \u201cactual knowledge\u201d of an\nalleged fiduciary breach to file suit within three years of gaining\nthat knowledge rather than within the 6-year period that would\notherwise apply. \u00a7413(a)(2)(A), 88Stat. 889, as amended, 29\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71113. The question here is whether a plaintiff\nnecessarily has \u201cactual knowledge\u201d of the information contained in\ndisclosures that he receives but does not read or cannot recall\nreading. We hold that he does not and therefore affirm.IARetirement plans governed by ERISA must have\nat least one named fiduciary, \u00a71102(a)(1), who must manage the plan\nprudently and solely in the interests of participants and their\nbeneficiaries, \u00a71104(a). Fiduciaries who breach these duties are\npersonally liable to the plan for any resulting losses. \u00a71109(a).\nERISA authorizes participants and their beneficiaries, as well as\nco-fiduciaries and the Secretary of Labor, to sue for that relief.\n\u00a71132(a)(2).Such suits must be filed within one of three\ntime periods, each with different triggering events. The first\nbegins when the breach occurs. Specifically, under \u00a71113(1), suit\nmust be filed within six years of \u201cthe date of the last action\nwhich constituted a part of the breach or violation\u201d or, in cases\nof breach by omission, \u201cthe latest date on which the fiduciary\ncould have cured the breach or violation.\u201d We have referred to\n\u00a71113(1) as a statute of repose, which \u201ceffect[s] a legislative\njudgment that a defendant should be free from liability after the\nlegislatively determined period of time.\u201dCalifornia Public\nEmployees\u2019 Retirement Systemv.ANZ Securities, Inc.,\n582 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 5) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).The second period, which accelerates the filing\ndeadline, begins when the plaintiff gains \u201cactual knowledge\u201d of the\nbreach. Under \u00a71113(2), suit must be filed within three years of\n\u201cthe earliest date on which the plaintiff had actual knowledge of\nthe breach or violation.\u201d Section 1113(2) is a statute of\nlimitations, which \u201cencourage[s] plaintiffs to pursue diligent\nprosecution of known claims.\u201dId., at ___ (slip op., at 5)\n(internal quotation marks omitted).The third period, which applies \u201cin the case of\nfraud or concealment,\u201d begins when the plaintiff discovers the\nalleged breach. \u00a71113. In such cases, suit must be filed within six\nyears of \u201cthe date of discovery.\u201dIbid.BRespondent Sulyma worked at Intel Corporation\nfrom 2010 to 2012. He participated in two Intel retirement plans,\nthe Intel Retirement Contribution Plan and the Intel 401(k) Savings\nPlan. Payments into these plans were in turn invested in two funds\nmanaged by the Intel Investment Policy Committee.[1] These funds mostly comprised stocks and\nbonds. After the stock market decline in 2008, however, the\ncommittee increased the funds\u2019 shares of alternative assets, such\nas hedge funds, private equity, and commodities. These assets\ncarried relatively high fees. And as the stock market rebounded,\nSulyma\u2019s funds lagged behind others such as index funds.Sulyma filed this suit on behalf of a putative\nclass in October 2015, alleging primarily that the committee and\nother plan administrators (petitioners here) had breached their\nfiduciary duties by overinvesting in alternative assets.\nPetitioners countered that the suit was untimely under \u00a71113(2).\nAlthough Sulyma filed it within six years of the alleged breaches,\nhe filed it more than three years after petitioners had disclosed\ntheir investment decisions to him.ERISA and its implementing regulations mandate\nvarious disclosures to plan participants. See generally 29\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a71021\u20131031; see alsoGobeillev.Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 577 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___\u2013___ (2016).\nSulyma received numerous disclosures while working at Intel, some\nexplaining the extent to which his retirement plans were invested\nin alternative assets. In November 2011, for example, he received\nan e-mail informing him that a Qualified Default Investment\nAlternative (QDIA) notice was available on a website called\nNetBenefits, where many of his disclosures were hosted. See App.\n149\u2013151; see also 29 CFR \u00a7\u00a72550.404c\u20135(b)\u2013(d) (2019) (QDIA\nnotices); \u00a72520.104b\u20131(c) (regulating electronic disclosure). This\nnotice broke down the percentages at which his 401(k) fund was\ninvested in stocks, bonds, hedge funds, and commodities. See App.\n236. In 2012, he received a summary plan description explaining\nthat the funds were invested in stocks and alternative assets,id., at 227, and referring him to other documents\u2014called\nfund fact sheets\u2014with the percentages in graphical form. See 29\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a71022, 1024(b) (summary plan descriptions); see\nalso App. 307 (June 2012 fact sheet for his 401(k) plan fund);id., at 338 (June 2012 fact sheet for his retirement\ncontribution plan fund);id., at 277\u2013340 (other fact sheets\nprovided during his tenure at Intel). Also in 2012, he received\ne-mails directing him to annual disclosures that petitioners\nprovided for both his plans, which showed the underlying funds\u2019\nreturn rates and again directed him to the NetBenefits site for\nfurther information. See 29 CFR \u00a72550.404a\u20135; see also App. 242\u2013243\n(retirement contribution plan annual disclosure);id., at\n250\u2013251 (401(k) plan annual disclosure).Petitioners submitted records showing that\nSulyma visited the NetBenefits site repeatedly during his\nemployment.Id., at 258\u2013276. But he testified in his\ndeposition that he did not \u201cremember reviewing\u201d the above\ndisclosures during his tenure.Id., at 175; see alsoid., at 183, 193, 196\u2013197. He also stated in a declaration\nthat he was \u201cunaware\u201d while working at Intel \u201cthat the monies that\n[he] had invested through the Intel retirement plans had been\ninvested in hedge funds or private equity.\u201dId., at 212. He\nrecalled reviewing only account statements sent to him by mail,\nwhich directed him to the NetBenefits site and noted that his plans\nwere invested in \u201cshort-term/other\u201d assets but did not specify\nwhich. See,e.g.,id., at 375.The District Court granted summary judgment to\npetitioners under \u00a71113(2), reasoning that \u201c[i]t would be improper\nto allow Sulyma\u2019s claims to survive merely because he did not look\nfurther into the disclosures made to him.\u201d 2017 WL 1217185, *9 (ND\nCal., Mar. 31, 2017). The Ninth Circuit reversed. As relevant\nhere,[2] the court construed\n\u201cactual knowledge\u201d to mean \u201cwhat it says: knowledge that is actual,\nnot merely a possible inference from ambiguous circumstances.\u201d 909\nF.3d 1069, 1076 (2018) (internal quotation marks omitted). Although\nSulyma \u201chad sufficient information available to him to know about\nthe allegedly imprudent investments\u201d more than three years before\nfiling suit, the court held that his testimony created a dispute as\nto when he actually gained that knowledge.Id., at 1077.Several Circuits have likewise construed\n\u00a71113(2) to require \u201cknowledge that is actual,\u201did., at\n1076, but one has construed it to require only proof of sufficient\ndisclosure.[3] We granted\ncertiorari, 587 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2019), to resolve whether the\nphrase \u201cactual knowledge\u201d does in fact mean \u201cwhat it says,\u201d 909\nF.\u00a03d, at 1076, and hold that it does.IIA\u201cWe must enforce plain and unambiguous\nstatutory language\u201d in ERISA, as in any statute, \u201caccording to its\nterms.\u201dHardtv.Reliance Standard Life Ins. Co.,560 U.S.\n242, 251 (2010). Although ERISA does not define the phrase\n\u201cactual knowledge,\u201d its meaning is plain. Dictionaries are hardly\nnecessary to confirm the point, but they do. When Congress passed\nERISA, the word \u201cactual\u201d meant what it means today: \u201cexisting in\nfact or reality.\u201d Webster\u2019s Seventh New Collegiate Dictionary 10\n(1967); accord, Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary 13 (11th\ned. 2005) (same); see also American Heritage Dictionary 14 (1973)\n(\u201cIn existence; real; factual\u201d);id., at 18 (5th ed. 2011)\n(\u201cExisting in reality and not potential, possible, simulated, or\nfalse\u201d). So did the word \u201cknowledge,\u201d which meant and still means\n\u201cthe fact or condition of being aware of something.\u201d Webster\u2019s\nSeventh New Collegiate Dictionary 469 (1967); accord,\nMerriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary 691 (2005) (same); see also\nAmerican Heritage Dictionary 725 (1973) (\u201cFamiliarity, awareness,\nor understanding gained through experience or study\u201d);id.,\nat 973 (2011) (same). Thus, to have \u201cactual knowledge\u201d of a piece\nof information, one must in fact be aware of it.Legal dictionaries give \u201cactual knowledge\u201d the\nsame meaning: \u201c[r]eal knowledge as distinguished from presumed\nknowledge or knowledge imputed to one.\u201d Ballentine\u2019s Law Dictionary\n24 (3d ed. 1969); accord, Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1043 (11th ed.\n2019) (defining \u201cactual knowledge\u201d as \u201c[d]irect and clear\nknowledge, as distinguished from constructive knowledge\u201d).[4] The qualifier \u201cactual\u201d creates that\ndistinction. In everyday speech, \u201cactual knowledge\u201d might seem\nredundant; one who claims \u201cknowledge\u201d of a topic likely means to\nsuggest that he actually knows a thing or two about it. But the law\nwill sometimes impute knowledge\u2014often called \u201cconstructive\u201d\nknowledge\u2014to a person who fails to learn something that a\nreasonably diligent person would have learned. Seeid., at\n1043. Similarly, we held inMerck & Co.v.Reynolds,559 U.S.\n633(2010), that the word \u201cdiscovery,\u201d when used in a statute\nof limitations without qualification, \u201cencompasses not only those\nfacts the plaintiff actually knew, but also those facts a\nreasonably diligent plaintiff would have known.\u201dId., at\n648. The addition of \u201cactual\u201d in \u00a71113(2) signals that the\nplaintiff\u00a0\u2019s knowledge must be more than \u201cpotential, possible,\nvirtual, conceivable, theoretical, hypothetical, or nominal.\u201d\nBlack\u2019s Law Dictionary 53 (4th ed. 1951). Indeed, inMerck,\nwe cited \u00a71113(2) as evidence of the \u201clinguistic distinction\u201d\nbetween \u201c\u00a0\u2018actual knowledge\u2019\u00a0\u201d and the\n\u201chypothetical\u201d knowledge that a reasonably diligent plaintiff would\nhave. 559 U.\u00a0S., at 646\u2013647 (quoting \u00a71113(2); emphasis in\noriginal).Congress has drawn the same distinction\nelsewhere in ERISA. Multiple provisions contain alternate 6-year\nand 3-year limitations periods, with the 6-year period beginning at\n\u201cthe date on which the cause of action arose\u201d and the 3-year period\nstarting at \u201cthe earliest date on which the plaintiff acquiredor should have acquiredactual knowledge of the existence of\nsuch cause of action.\u201d \u00a7\u00a71303(e)(6), (f\u00a0)(5) (emphasis added);\naccord, \u00a7\u00a71370(f\u00a0)(1)\u2013(2), 1451(f\u00a0)(1)\u2013(2). ERISA also\nrequires plaintiffs challenging the suspension of benefits under\n\u00a71085 to do so within \u201cone year after the earliest date on which\nthe plaintiff acquired or should have acquired actual knowledge of\nthe existence of such cause of action.\u201d \u00a71085(e)(9)(I)(iv). Thus,\nCongress has repeatedly drawn a \u201clinguistic distinction\u201d between\nwhat an ERISA plaintiff actually knows and what he should actually\nknow.Merck, 559 U.\u00a0S., at 647. And when Congress has\nincluded both forms of knowledge in a provision limiting ERISA\nactions, it has done so explicitly. We cannot assume that it meant\nto do so by implication in \u00a71113(2). Instead we \u201cgenerally\npresum[e] that Congress acts intentionally and purposely when it\nincludes particular language in one section of a statute but omits\nit in another.\u201dBFPv.Resolution Trust Corporation,511 U.S.\n531, 537 (1994) (internal quotation marks omitted).Petitioners dispute the characterization of\nanything less than actual knowledge as constructive knowledge,\narguing that the latter term usually refers to information that a\nplaintiff must seek out rather than information that is sent to\nhim. But if a plaintiff is not aware of a fact, he does not have\n\u201cactual knowledge\u201d of that fact however close at hand the fact\nmight be. \u00a71113(2). And Congress has never added to \u00a71113(2) the\nlanguage it has used in other ERISA limitations provisions to\nencompass both what a plaintiff actually knows and what he\nreasonably could know.As presently written, therefore, \u00a71113(2)\nrequires more than evidence of disclosure alone. That all relevant\ninformation was disclosed to the plaintiff is no doubtrelevantin judging whether he gained knowledge of that\ninformation. See Part III,infra. To meet \u00a71113(2)\u2019s \u201cactual\nknowledge\u201d requirement, however, the plaintiff must in fact have\nbecome aware of that information.BPetitioners offer arguments for a broader\nreading of \u00a71113(2) based on text, context, purpose, and statutory\nhistory. All founder on Congress\u2019s choice of the word \u201cactual.\u201dAs for text, petitioners do not dispute the\nnormal definitions of \u201cactual,\u201d \u201cknowledge,\u201d or \u201cactual knowledge.\u201d\nThey focus instead on the least conspicuous part of the phrase \u201chad\nactual knowledge\u201d: the word \u201chad.\u201d \u00a71113(2). Once a plaintiff\nreceives a disclosure, they argue, he \u201cha[s]\u201d the knowledge that\n\u00a71113(2) requires because he effectively holds it in his hand.Ibid.In other words, he has the requisite knowledge because\nhe could acquire it with reason- able effort. That turns \u00a71113(2)\ninto what it is plainly not: a constructive-knowledge\nrequirement.Petitioners\u2019 contextual argument fails for the\nsame reason. As they point out, ERISA\u2019s disclosure regime is meant\nto \u201censur[e] that \u2018the individual participant knows exactly where\nhe stands with respect to the plan.\u2019\u00a0\u201dFirestone Tire &\nRubber Co.v.Bruch,489 U.S.\n101, 118 (1989) (quoting H.\u00a0R. Rep. No. 93\u2013533, p.\u00a011\n(1973)). This is the reason for ERISA\u2019s requirements that\ndisclosures be written for a lay audience. See,e.g., 29\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71022(a). Once plan administrators satisfy their\nobligations to impart knowledge, petitioners say, \u00a71113(2)\u2019s\nknowledge requirement is satisfied too. But that is simply not what\n\u00a71113(2) says. Unlike other ERISA limitations periods\u2014which also\nform \u00a71113(2)\u2019s context\u2014\u00a71113(2) begins only when a plaintiff\nactually is aware of the relevant facts, not when he should be. And\na given plaintiff will not necessarily be aware of all facts\ndisclosed to him; even a reasonably diligent plaintiff would not\nknow those facts immediately upon receiving the disclosure.\nAlthough \u201cthe words of a statute must be read in their context,\u201dDavisv.Michigan Dept. of Treasury,489 U.S.\n803, 809 (1989), petitioners\u2019 argument again gives the word\n\u201cactual\u201d little meaning at all.Petitioners also argue that \u00a71113(2)\u2019s plain\nmeaning undermines its purpose of protecting plan administrators\nfrom suits over bygone investment decisions. If a plan participant\ncan simply deny knowledge, they say, administrators will rarely get\nthe benefit of \u00a71113(2). But even if this is true, as it may well\nbe, we cannot say that heeding the clear meaning of the word\n\u201cactual\u201d renders the statute so \u201c\u00a0\u2018[in]coherent\u2019\u00a0\u201d that\nit must be disregarded.Kingdomware Technologies, Inc.v.United States, 579 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at\n8).For one thing, plan participants are not the\nonly potential plaintiffs subject to \u00a71113. The Secretary of Labor,\nfor example, may also sue imprudent fiduciaries for the benefit of\nplan participants. See \u00a71132(a)(2). And the United States\nrepresents that the Secretary will have a hard time doing so within\n\u00a71113(2)\u2019s timeframe if deemed to have actual knowledge of the\nfacts contained in the many reports that the Department receives\nfrom ERISA plans each year. See Brief for United States asAmicus Curiae27\u201328. Moreover, the statute\u2019s repose period\nwill still protect defendants from suits filed more than six years\nafter the alleged breach. See \u00a71113(1).Petitioners may well be correct that heeding the\nplain meaning of \u00a71113(2) substantially diminishes the protection\nthat it provides for ERISA fiduciaries, but by the same token,\npetitioners\u2019 interpretation would greatly reduce \u00a71113(1)\u2019s value\nfor beneficiaries, given the disclosure regime that petitioners\nthemselves emphasize. Choosing between these alternatives is a task\nfor Congress, and we must assume that the language of \u00a71113(2)\nreflects Congress\u2019s choice. If policy considerations suggest that\nthe current scheme should be altered, Congress must be the one to\ndo it. See,e.g.,Azarv.Allina Health\nServices, 587 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2019).Finally, petitioners argue that the plain\nmeaning of \u201cactual knowledge\u201d renders anearlierversion of\n\u00a71113(2) incoherent. As originally enacted, the \u00a71113(2)\nlimitations period began either when the plaintiff gained actual\nknowledge of the alleged breach or when \u201ca report from which [the\nplaintiff] could reasonably be expected to have obtained knowledge\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. was filed with\u201d the Secretary of Labor. 29\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71113(2) (1976 ed.). That latter,\nconstructive-knowledge clause was later repealed. See Omnibus\nBudget Reconciliation Act of 1987, \u00a79342(b), 101Stat. 1330\u2013371.\nAccording to petitioners, if \u201cactual knowledge\u201d means what it says,\nthen the original version of \u00a71113(2) charged plan participants\nwith learning what was sent to the Secretary but not what was sent\nto them.The version at issue here, however, is the\ncurrent one\u2014from which Congress removed any mention of constructive\nknowledge. \u201cWhen Congress acts to amend a statute, we presume it\nintends its amendment to have real and substantial effect.\u201dIntel Corp.v.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.,542 U.S.\n241, 258\u2013259 (2004) (internal quotation marks omitted). Section\n1113(2)\u2019s history thus more readily suggests that the current\nversion does in fact require actual knowledge.IIINothing in this opinion forecloses any of the\n\u201cusual ways\u201d to prove actual knowledge at any stage in the\nlitigation.Farmerv.Brennan,511 U.S.\n825, 842 (1994). Plaintiffs who recall reading particular\ndisclosures will of course be bound by oath to say so in their\ndepositions. On top of that, actual knowledge can be proved through\n\u201cinference from circumstantial evidence.\u201dIbid.; see alsoStaplesv.United States,511\nU.S. 600, 615\u2013616, n. 11 (1994) (\u201c[K]nowledge can be inferred\nfrom circumstantial evidence\u201d). Evidence of disclosure would no\ndoubt be relevant, as would electronic records showing that a\nplaintiff viewed the relevant disclosures and evidence suggesting\nthat the plaintiff took action in response to the information\ncontained in them. And though, \u201c[a]t the summary judgment stage,\nfacts must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving\nparty,\u201d that is true \u201conly if there is a \u2018genuine\u2019 dispute as to\nthose facts.\u201dScottv.Harris,550 U.S.\n372, 380 (2007) (quoting Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 56(c)). If a\nplaintiff\u00a0\u2019s denial of knowledge is \u201cblatantly contradicted by\nthe record,\u201d \u201ca court should not adopt that version of the facts\nfor purposes of ruling on a motion for summary judgment.\u201d 550\nU.\u00a0S., at 380.Today\u2019s opinion also does not preclude\ndefendants from contending that evidence of \u201cwillful blindness\u201d\nsupports a finding of \u201cactual knowledge.\u201d Cf.Global-Tech\nAppliances, Inc.v.SEB S.\u00a0A.,563 U.S.\n754, 769 (2011).In the case before us, however, petitioners do\nnot argue that \u201cactual knowledge\u201d is established in any of these\nways, only that they need not offer any such proof. And that is\nincorrect.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*For these reasons, we affirm.It is so ordered.Notes1Specifically the Intel\nGlobal Diversified Fund, in which his retirement contribution plan\nwas automatically invested, and the Intel Target Date 2045 Fund,\nwhich he chose for his 401(k) plan.2The court also addressed\nthe separate question of what exactly a plaintiff must actually\nknow about a defendant\u2019s conduct and the relevant law in order for\n\u00a71113(2) to apply.
