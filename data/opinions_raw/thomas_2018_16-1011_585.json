See 35 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7271(f\u00a0)(2). A patent owner who proves infringement under this\nprovision is entitled to recover damages. \u00a7284. The question in\nthis case is whether these statutes allow the patent owner to\nrecover for lost foreign profits. We hold that they do.IThe Patent Act gives patent owners a \u201ccivil\naction for infringement.\u201d \u00a7281. Section 271 outlines several types\nof infringement. The general infringement provision, \u00a7271(a),\ncovers most infringements that occur \u201cwithin the United States.\u201d\nThe subsection at issue in this case, \u00a7271(f\u00a0), \u201cexpands the\ndefinition of infringement to include supplying from the United\nStates a patented invention\u2019s components.\u201dMicrosoft Corp.v.AT&T Corp., 550 U.\u00a0S. 437, 444\u2013445 (2007). It\ncontains two provisions that \u201cwork in tandem\u201d by addressing\n\u201cdifferent scenarios.\u201dLife Technologies Corp.v.Promega\nCorp., 580 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 9). Section\n271(f\u00a0)(1) addresses the act of exporting a substantial\nportion of an invention\u2019s components:\u201cWhoever without authority supplies or\ncauses to be supplied in or from the United States all or a\nsubstantial portion of the components of a patented invention,\nwhere such components are uncombined in whole or in part, in such\nmanner as to actively induce the combination of such components\noutside of the United States in a manner that would infringe the\npatent if such combination occurred within the United States, shall\nbe liable as an infringer.\u201dSection 271(f\u00a0)(2), the provision at issue\nhere, addresses the act of exporting components that are specially\nadapted for an invention:\u201cWhoever without authority supplies or\ncauses to be supplied in or from the United States any component of\na patented invention that is especially made or especially adapted\nfor use in the invention and not a staple article or commodity of\ncommerce suitable for substantial noninfringing use, where such\ncomponent is uncombined in whole or in part, knowing that such\ncomponent is so made or adapted and intending that such component\nwill be combined outside of the United States in a manner that\nwould infringe the patent if such combination occurred within the\nUnited States, shall be liable as an infringer.\u201dPatent owners who prove infringement under \u00a7271\nare entitled to relief under \u00a7284, which authorizes \u201cdamages\nadequate to compensate for the infringement, but in no event less\nthan a reasonable royalty for the use made of the invention by the\ninfringer.\u201dIIPetitioner WesternGeco LLC owns four patents\nrelating to a system that it developed for surveying the ocean\nfloor. The system uses lateral-steering technology to produce\nhigher quality data than previous survey systems. Western- Geco\ndoes not sell its technology or license it to compet- itors.\nInstead, it uses the technology itself, performing surveys for oil\nand gas companies. For several years, WesternGeco was the only\nsurveyor that used such lateral-steering technology.In late 2007, respondent ION Geophysical\nCorporation began selling a competing system. It manufactured the\ncomponents for its competing system in the United States and then\nshipped them to companies abroad. Those companies combined the\ncomponents to create a surveying system indistinguishable from\nWesternGeco\u2019s and used the system to compete with WesternGeco.WesternGeco sued for patent infringement under\n\u00a7\u00a7271(f\u00a0)(1) and (f\u00a0)(2). At trial, WesternGeco proved\nthat it had lost 10 specific survey contracts due to ION\u2019s\ninfringement. The jury found ION liable and awarded WesternGeco\ndamages of $12.5 million in royalties and $93.4 million in lost\nprofits. ION filed a post-trial motion to set aside the verdict,\narguing that WesternGeco could not recover damages for lost profits\nbecause \u00a7271(f\u00a0) does not apply extraterritorially. The\nDistrict Court denied the motion. 953 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d 731, 755\u2013756\n(SD Tex. 2013).On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Federal\nCircuit reversed the award of lost-profits damages.WesternGecoLLCv.ION Geophysical Corp., 791\nF.\u00a03d 1340, 1343 (2015).[1] The Federal Circuit had previously held that \u00a7271(a),\nthe general infringement provision, does not allow patent owners to\nrecover for lost foreign sales. Seeid.,at 1350\u20131351\n(citingPower Integrations, Inc.v.Fairchild\nSemiconductor Int\u2019l, Inc., 711 F.\u00a03d 1348 (CA Fed. 2013)).\nSection 271(f\u00a0) should be interpreted the same way, the\nFederal Circuit reasoned, because it was \u201cdesigned\u201d to put patent\ninfringers \u201cin a similar position.\u201dWesternGeco, 791\nF.\u00a03d, at 1351. Judge Wallach dissented. Seeid.,at\n1354\u20131364. WesternGeco petitioned for review in this Court. We\ngranted the petition, vacated the Federal Circuit\u2019s judgment, and\nremanded for further consideration in light of our decision inHalo Electronics, Inc.v.Pulse Electronics, Inc.,\n579 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2016).WesternGeco LLCv.ION\nGeophysical Corp., 579 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2016).On remand, the panel majority reinstated the\nportion of its decision regarding the extraterritoriality of\n\u00a7271(f\u00a0). 837 F.\u00a03d 1358, 1361, 1364 (CA Fed. 2016).\nJudge Wallach dissented again,id.,at 1364\u20131369, and we\ngranted certiorari again, 583 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2018). We now\nreverse.IIICourts presume that federal statutes \u201capply\nonly within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States.\u201dFoley Bros., Inc.v.Filardo, 336 U.\u00a0S. 281, 285\n(1949). This principle, commonly called the presumption against\nextraterritoriality, has deep roots. See A. Scalia & B. Garner,\nReading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts \u00a743, p. 268 (2012)\n(tracing it to the medieval maximStatuta suo clauduntur\nterritorio, nec ultra territorium disponunt);e.g., United\nStatesv.Palmer, 3 Wheat. 610, 631 (1818) (Marshall,\nC.\u00a0J.) (\u201c[G]eneral words must .\u00a0.\u00a0. be limited to\ncases within the jurisdiction of the state\u201d). The presumption rests\non \u201cthe commonsense notion that Congress generally legislates with\ndomestic concerns in mind.\u201dSmithv.United States,\n507 U.\u00a0S. 197, 204, n.\u00a05 (1993). And it prevents\n\u201cunintended clashes between our laws and those of other nations\nwhich could result in international discord.\u201dEEOCv.Arabian American Oil Co., 499 U.\u00a0S. 244, 248\n(1991).This Court has established a two-step framework\nfor deciding questions of extraterritoriality. The first step asks\n\u201cwhether the presumption against extraterritoriality has been\nrebutted.\u201dRJR Nabisco, Inc.v.European Community,\n579 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 9). It can be rebutted\nonly if the text provides a \u201cclear indication of an\nextraterritorial application.\u201dMorrisonv.National\nAustraliaBank Ltd., 561 U.\u00a0S. 247, 255 (2010). If\nthe presumption against extraterritoriality has not been rebutted,\nthe second step of our framework asks \u201cwhether the case involves a\ndomestic application of the statute.\u201dRJR Nabisco, 579\nU.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 9). Courts make this determination\nby identifying \u201cthe statute\u2019s \u2018focus\u2019\u00a0\u201d and asking whether the\nconduct relevant to that focus occurred in United States territory.Ibid.If it did, then the case involves a permissible\ndomestic application of the statute. Seeibid.We resolve this case at step two. While \u201cit will\nusually be preferable\u201d to begin with step one, courts have the\ndiscretion to begin at step two \u201cin appropriate cases.\u201d Seeid.,at ___, n.\u00a05 (slip op., at 10, n.\u00a05) (citingPearsonv.Callahan, 555 U.\u00a0S. 223, 236\u2013243\n(2009)). One reason to exercise that discretion is if addressing\nstep one would require resolving \u201cdifficult questions\u201d that do not\nchange \u201cthe outcome of the case,\u201d but could have far-reaching\neffects in future cases. Seeid.,at 236\u2013237. That is true\nhere. WesternGeco argues that the presumption against\nextraterritoriality should never apply to statutes, such as \u00a7284,\nthat merely provide a general damages remedy for conduct that\nCongress has declared unlawful. Resolving that question could\nimplicate many other statutes besides the Patent Act. We therefore\nexercise our discretion to forgo the first step of our\nextraterritoriality framework.AUnder the second step of our framework, we\nmust identify \u201cthe statute\u2019s \u2018focus.\u2019\u00a0\u201dRJR Nabisco,supra, at ___ (slip op., at 9). The focus of a statute is\n\u201cthe objec[t] of [its] solicitude,\u201d which can include the conduct\nit \u201cseeks to \u2018regulate,\u2019\u00a0\u201d as well as the parties and\ninterests it \u201cseeks to \u2018protec[t]\u2019\u00a0\u201d or vindicate.Morrison,supra, at 267 (quotingSuperintendent of\nIns. of N.\u00a0Y.v.Bankers Life & Casualty Co.,\n404 U.\u00a0S. 6, 12, 10 (1971)). \u201cIf the conduct relevant to the\nstatute\u2019s focus occurred in the United States, then the case\ninvolves a permissible domestic application\u201d of the statute, \u201ceven\nif other conduct occurred abroad.\u201dRJR Nabisco, 579\nU.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 9). But if the relevant conduct\noccurred in another country, \u201cthen the case involves an\nimpermissible extraterritorial application regardless of any other\nconduct that occurred in U.\u00a0S. territory.\u201dIbid.When determining the focus of a statute, we do\nnot analyze the provision at issue in a vacuum. SeeMorrison,supra,at 267\u2013269. If the statutory\nprovision at issue works in tandem with other provisions, it must\nbe assessed in concert with those other provisions. Otherwise, it\nwould be impossible to accurately determine whether the application\nof the statute in the case is a \u201cdomestic application.\u201dRJR\nNabisco, 579 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 9). And\ndetermining how the statute has actually been applied is the whole\npoint of the focus test. Seeibid.Applying these principles here, we conclude that\nthe conduct relevant to the statutory focus in this case is\ndomestic. We begin with \u00a7284. It provides a general damages remedy\nfor the various types of patent infringement identified in the\nPatent Act. The portion of \u00a7284 at issue here states that \u201cthe\ncourt shall award the claimant damages adequate to compensate for\nthe infringement.\u201d We conclude that \u201cthe infringement\u201d is the focus\nof this statute. As this Court has explained, the \u201coverriding\npurpose\u201d of \u00a7284 is to \u201caffor[d] patent owners complete\ncompensation\u201d for infringements.General Motors Corp.v.Devex Corp.,461 U.\u00a0S. 648, 655 (1983). \u201cThe question\u201d\nposed by the statute is \u201c\u00a0\u2018how much ha[s] the Patent Holder\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. suffered by the infringement.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAro Mfg.\nCo.v.Convertible Top Replacement Co., 377 U.\u00a0S.\n476, 507 (1964). Accordingly, the infringement is plainly the focus\nof \u00a7284.But that observation does not fully resolve this\ncase, as the Patent Act identifies several ways that a patent can\nbe infringed. See \u00a7271. To determine the focus of \u00a7284 in a given\ncase, we must look to the type of infringement that occurred. We\nthus turn to \u00a7271(f\u00a0)(2), which was the basis for\nWesternGeco\u2019s infringement claim and the lost-profits damages that\nit received.[2]Section 271(f\u00a0)(2) focuses on domestic\nconduct. It provides that a company \u201cshall be liable as an\ninfringer\u201d if it \u201csupplies\u201d certain components of a patented\ninvention \u201cin or from the United States\u201d with the intent that they\n\u201cwill be combined outside of the United States in a manner that\nwould infringe the patent if such combination occurred within the\nUnited States.\u201d The conduct that \u00a7271(f\u00a0)(2)\nregulates\u2014i.e.,its focus\u2014is the domestic act of\n\u201csuppl[ying] in or from the United States.\u201d As this Court has\nacknowledged, \u00a7271(f\u00a0) vindicates domestic interests: It \u201cwas\na direct response to a gap in our patent law,\u201dMicrosoft\nCorp., 550 U.\u00a0S., at 457, and \u201creach[es] components that\nare manufactured in the United States but assembled overseas,\u201dLife Technologies, 580 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 11).\nAs the Federal Circuit explained, \u00a7271(f\u00a0)(2) protects against\n\u201cdomestic entities who export components .\u00a0.\u00a0. from the\nUnited States.\u201d 791 F.\u00a03d, at 1351.In sum, the focus of \u00a7284, in a case involving\ninfringement under \u00a7271(f\u00a0)(2), is on the act of exporting\ncomponents from the United States. In other words, the domestic\ninfringement is \u201cthe objec[t] of the statute\u2019s solicitude\u201d in this\ncontext.Morrison, 561 U.\u00a0S., at 267. The conduct in\nthis case that is relevant to that focus clearly occurred in the\nUnited States, as it was ION\u2019s domestic act of supplying the\ncomponents that infringed WesternGeco\u2019s pat- ents. Thus, the\nlost-profits damages that were awarded to WesternGeco were a\ndomestic application of \u00a7284.BION\u2019s arguments to the contrary are not\npersuasive. ION contends that the statutory focus here is\n\u201cself-evidently on the award of damages.\u201d Brief for Respondent 22.\nWhile \u00a7284 does authorize damages, what a statute authorizes is not\nnecessarily its focus. Rather, the focus is \u201cthe objec[t] of the\nstatute\u2019s solicitude\u201d\u2014which can turn on the \u201cconduct,\u201d \u201cparties,\u201d\nor interests that it regulates or protects.Morrison,supra, at 267. Here, the damages themselves are merely the\nmeans by which the statute achieves its end of remedying\ninfringements. Similarly, ION is mistaken to assert that this case\ninvolves an extraterritorial application of \u00a7284 simply because\n\u201clost-profits damages occurred extraterritorially, and foreign\nconduct subsequent to [ION\u2019s] infringement was necessary to give\nrise to the injury.\u201d Brief for Respondent 22. Those overseas events\nwere merely incidental to the infringement. In other words, they do\nnot have \u201cprimacy\u201d for purposes of the extraterritoriality\nanalysis.Morrison,supra, at 267.ION also draws on the conclusion inRJR\nNabiscothat \u201cRICO damages claims\u201d based \u201centirely on injury\nsuffered abroad\u201d involve an extraterritorial application of 18\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71964(c). 579 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at\n27). From this principle, ION extrapolates a general rule that\ndamages awards for foreign injuries are always an extraterritorial\napplication of a damages provision. This argument misreadsRJR\nNabisco. That portion ofRJR Nabiscointerpreted a\nsubstantive element of a cause of action, not a remedial damages\nprovision. Seeid.,at ___ (slip op., at 18). It explained\nthat a plaintiff could not bring a damages claim under \u00a71964(c)\nunless he could prove that he was \u201c\u00a0\u2018injured in his business\nor property,\u2019\u00a0\u201d which required proof of \u201cadomesticinjury.\u201dIbid.Thus,RJR Nabiscowas applying the\npresumption against extraterritoriality to interpret the scope of\n\u00a71964(c)\u2019s injury requirement; it did not make any statements about\ndamages\u2014a separate legal concept.Two of our colleagues contend that the Patent\nAct does not permit damages awards for lost foreign profits.Post, at 1 (Gorsuch, J., joined by Breyer, J., dissenting).\nTheir position wrongly conflates legal injury with the damages\narising from that injury. Seepost, at 2\u20133. And it is not\nthe better reading of \u201cthe plain text of the Patent Act.\u201dPost, at 9. Taken together, \u00a7271(f\u00a0)(2) and \u00a7284 allow\nthe patent owner to recover for lost foreign profits. Under \u00a7284,\ndamages are \u201cadequate\u201d to compensate for infringement when they\n\u201cplac[e] [the patent owner] in as good a position as he would have\nbeen in\u201d if the patent had not been infringed.General Motors\nCorp., supra, at 655. Specifically, a patent owner is entitled\nto recover \u201c\u00a0\u2018the difference between [its] pecuniary condition\nafter the infringement, and what [its] condition would have been if\nthe infringement had not occurred.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAro Mfg. Co.,\nsupra,at 507. This recovery can include lost profits. SeeYale Lock Mfg. Co.v.Sargent, 117 U.\u00a0S. 536,\n552\u2013553 (1886). And, as we hold today, it can include lost foreign\nprofits when the patent owner proves infringement under\n\u00a7271(f\u00a0)(2).[3]*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*We hold that WesternGeco\u2019s damages award for\nlost profits was a permissible domestic application of \u00a7284. The\njudgment of the Federal Circuit is reversed, and the case is\nremanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.Notes1The Federal Circuit held\nthat ION was liable for infringement under \u00a7271(f\u00a0)(2).WesternGeco, 791 F.\u00a03d, at 1347\u20131349. It did not\naddress whether ION was liable under \u00a7271(f\u00a0)(1).Id.,\nat 1348.2Because the Federal\nCircuit did not address \u00a7271(f\u00a0)(1), see n.\u00a01,supra, we limit our analysis to\n\u00a7271(f\u00a0)(2).3In reaching this holding,\nwe do not address the extent to which other doctrines, such as\nproximate cause, could limit or preclude damages in particular\ncases.",
