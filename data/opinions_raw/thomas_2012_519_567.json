The joint dissent and The Chief Justice cor- rectly apply\nour precedents to conclude that the Individual Mandate is beyond\nthe power granted to Congress un- der the Commerce Clause and the\nNecessary and Proper Clause. Under those precedents, Congress may\nregulate \u201ceconomic activity [that] substantially affects interstate\ncommerce.\u201dUnited Statesv.Lopez,514 U.S.\n549, 560 (1995). I adhere to my view that \u201cthe very notion of a\n\u2018substantial effects\u2019 test under the Commerce Clause is\ninconsistent with the original understanding of Congress\u2019 powers\nand with this Court\u2019s early Commerce Clause cases.\u201dUnited\nStatesv.Morrison,529 U.S.\n598, 627 (2000) (Thomas, J., concurring); see alsoLopez,\nsupra,at 584\u2013602 (Thomas, J., concurring);Gonzalesv.Raich,545 U.S.\n1, 67\u201369 (2005) (Thomas, J., dissenting). As I have explained,\nthe Court\u2019s continued use of that test \u201chas encouraged the Federal\nGovernment to persist in its view that the Commerce Clause has\nvirtually no limits.\u201dMorrison, supra,at 627. The\nGovernment\u2019s unprecedented claim in this suit that it may regulate\nnot only economic activity but alsoinactivitythat\nsubstantially affects interstate commerce is a case in point.",
