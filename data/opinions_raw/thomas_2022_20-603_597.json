Accordingly, we held\u2014without\nqualification\u2014that \u201cthe powers delegated to Congress under Article\nI of the United States Constitutiondo not includethe power\nto subject nonconsenting States to private suits for damages in\nstate courts.\u201dId.,at 712 (emphasis added).No longer. Today, by adopting contrived\ninterpretations ofAldenand the recent decision inPennEast Pipeline Co.v.New Jersey, 594 U.\u00a0S.\n___ (2021), the Court holds that at least two (and perhaps more)\nArticle I \u201cwar powers\u201d do, in fact, include \u201cthe power to subject\nnonconsenting States to private suits for damages in state courts,\u201dAlden, 527 U.\u00a0S., at 712, and that Congress has\nexercised that power by enacting the Uniformed Services Employment\nand Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (USERRA), 38 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a74301et seq.Aldenshould have squarely foreclosed\nthat holding. As the Court there already explained, constitutional\ntext, history, and precedent all show that when the States ratified\nthe Constitution, they did not implicitly consent to private\ndamages actions filed in their own courts\u2014whether authorized by\nCongress\u2019 war powers or any other Article I power. Because the\nCourt today holds otherwise, I respectfully dissent.IAfter declaring independence, the former\nColonies \u201cconsidered themselves fully sovereign nations.\u201dFranchise Tax Bd. of Cal.v.Hyatt, 587 U.\u00a0S.\n___, ___ (2019) (slip op., at 6).

That \u201cdoctrine .\u00a0.\u00a0. was universal in the\nStates when the Constitution was drafted and ratified,\u201dAlden,527 U.\u00a0S., at 715\u2013716; see alsoHansv.Louisiana,134 U.S.\n1, 16 (1890), because \u201c[t]he generation that designed and\nadopted our federal system considered immunity from private suits\ncentral to sovereign dignity,\u201d 527 U.\u00a0S., at 715; see also,e.g.,Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 535 U.\u00a0S., at\n760. In fact, sovereign immunity was so important that \u201c[t]he\nConstitution never would have been ratified if the States and their\ncourts were to be stripped of their sovereign authority except as\nexpressly provided by the Constitution itself.\u201dAtascadero State\nHospitalv.Scanlon,473 U.S.\n234, 239, n. 2 (1985); see alsoEx\u00a0parte New York,256 U.S.\n490, 497 (1921);Alden, 527 U.\u00a0S., at 716.Although States generally retained their\nimmunity from suit, \u201cin ratifying the Constitution, [they] did\nsurrender a portion of their inherent immunity.\u201dFederal\nMaritime Comm\u2019n, 535 U.\u00a0S., at 752. As Alexander Hamilton\nexplained in The Federalist, sovereign immunity was part of \u201cthe\ngeneral sense and the general practice of mankind,\u201d and the\nConstitution therefore left it \u201cwith the States\u201d unless they had\n\u201csurrender[ed]\u201d some portion \u201cof this immunity in the plan of the\nconvention.\u201d The Federalist No. 81, pp. 487\u2013488 (C. Rossiter ed.\n1961); see alsoHans, 134 U.\u00a0S., at 13;Alden,\n527 U.\u00a0S., at 755.During the Nation\u2019s first 200 years, this Court\nrecognized only two instances in which the States had surrendered\ntheir sovereign immunity in the constitutional plan, both of which\ninvolved suits prosecuted by other sovereigns. The States had\nagreed to be sued by other States in this Court, seePrincipality of Monacov.Mississippi,292 U.S.\n313, 328 (1934), and by the United States in federal court, seeUnited Statesv.Texas,143 U.S.\n621, 644\u2013645 (1892);Franchise Tax Bd., 587 U.\u00a0S.,\nat ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 9\u201310). When it came toprivatelitigation, however, this Court long maintained that \u201cthe Framers\nthought it an impermissible affront to a State\u2019s dignity to be\nrequired to answer the complaints of private parties in federal\ncourts,\u201dFederal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 535 U.\u00a0S., at 760,\nand that \u201cthe Convention did not disturb States\u2019 immunity from\nprivate suits,\u201did., at 752.Nevertheless, in the last two decades, the Court\nhas recognized two surrenders of sovereign immunity in cases\nimplicating private parties. First, inCentral Va. Community\nCollegev.Katz,546 U.S.\n356(2006), this Court held that States waived immunity against\nthe federal discharge of debts when they ratified the Bankruptcy\nClause. And, inPennEast, 594 U.\u00a0S. ___, it held that\nStates waived immunity against condemnation proceedings brought by\nprivate parties to whom the Federal Government has delegated its\neminent domain power. Taken together,KatzandPenn-Eastcentered on whether or not the plan of the\nConvention\u2014i.e.,the Constitution itself\u2014required States to\nsurrender their sovereign immunity. SeeKatz, 546\nU.\u00a0S., at 379;PennEast, 594 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 15).These cases contrast with those that involve\ncongressional \u201cabrogation\u201d of state sovereign immunity. Abrogation\nrests on some \u201cstatement Congress ha[s] made on the subject of\nstate sovereign immunity.\u201dKatz, 546 U.\u00a0S., at 378\u2013379.\nSpecifically, we have held that Congress must enact \u201cunequivocal\nstatutory language\u201d abrogating States\u2019 immunity.Seminole Tribe\nof Fla.v.Florida,517 U.S.\n44, 56 (1996) (internal quotation marks omitted). That said,\nthe line between \u201cplan-of-the-Convention waiver\u201d and \u201ccongressional\nabrogation\u201d is a murky one. Both inquiries ask the same basic\nquestion: whether Congress has authorized suit against a\nnonconsenting State pursuant to \u201ca valid exercise of constitutional\nauthority.\u201dKimelv.FloridaBd. of Regents,528 U.S.\n62, 78 (2000); see alsoKatz, 546 U.\u00a0S., at 379\n(asking whether Congress\u2019 decision to bind States to discharge\norders in bankruptcy proceedings is \u201cwithin the scope of its power\nto enact \u2018Laws on the subject of Bankruptcies\u2019\u00a0\u201d). And both\ninquiries center on \u201chistory, practice, precedent, and the\nstructure of the Constitution,\u201dAlden, 527 U.\u00a0S., at\n741, to determine whether the Constitution either grants authority\nto Congress to abrogate immunity or strips States of their immunity\non its own.The parties agree that this case involves only\nplan-of-the-Convention waiver. Thus, the question presented is\nwhether, in ratifying the Constitution, the States surrendered\ntheir immunity in their own courts against private damages actions\nauthorized by Congress\u2019 war powers.IIIn answering that question, the Court\ndiscounts two important points. First, it creates a constitutional\nproblem by adopting a questionable interpretation of USERRA that\nassumes Congress intended to legislate with indifference to States\u2019\nstate-law immunity. Second, the Court cannot escape the fact thatAldenalready answered the question presented and held that\nthe States did not surrender their state-court immunity when\nratifying Article I of the Constitution.AWhen it was originally enacted, USERRA\nauthorized covered employees to sue States in federal district\ncourt. See 38 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a74323(b) (1994 ed.). In 1996, this\nCourt decidedSeminole Tribe, holding that Congress could\nnot abrogate state sovereign immunity in federal courts using its\nArticle I powers. See 517 U.\u00a0S.,at 72\u201373. In response\ntoSeminole Tribe, Congress amended USERRA in 1998, and the\nstatute now provides: \u201cIn the case of an action against a State (as\nan employer) by a person, the action may be brought in a State\ncourt of competent jurisdictionin accordance with the laws of\nthe State.\u201d \u00a74323(b)(2) (emphasis added).USERRA\u2019s requirement that employee damages\nactions be \u201cin accordance with the laws of the State\u201d would seem to\ninclude a State\u2019s \u201claws\u201d that render it immune from suit in the\nState\u2019s own courts, as well as any \u201claws\u201d that expressly waive such\nimmunity. See,e.g.,Tex. Govt. Code Ann. \u00a7311.034 (West\n2013);Prairie View A & M Univ.v.Chatha, 381\nS.W.3d 500, 512 (Tex. 2012). In other words, there is nothing in\nthe text of USERRA necessarily implying that Congress intended to\nrequirenonconsentingStates to defend themselves in their\nown courts.[1] The Court,\nhowever, breezes past USERRA\u2019s language to conclude that the\nstatute \u201cauthoriz[es] private litigation against noncompliant state\nemployers that do not wish to consent to suit.\u201dAnte,at\n4.[2]To be clear, I am not disputing whether USERRA\nspeaks clearly enough to express a congressional intent to\n\u201cabrogate\u201d the States\u2019 sovereign immunity in their own courts;\nplan-of-the-Convention waiver asks whether the States surrendered\nthat immunity when the Constitution was ratified and thus \u201cagreed\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. not to assert that immunity\u201d in particular\ncontexts.Katz, 546 U.\u00a0S., at 373. But even if the\nConstitution itself partially strips state sovereign immunity, it\nwould still fall to Congress to decide whether, and on what terms,\nto render States amenable to suit, or to permit States to assert\nimmunity. Cf.id.,at 379 (\u201cCongress may, at its option,\neither treat States in the same way as other creditors insofar as\nconcerns \u2018Laws on the subject of Bankruptcies\u2019 or exempt them from\nthe operation of such laws\u201d).The Court should not casually consider the\nconstitutionality of USERRA\u2019s supposed subjection of nonconsenting\nStates to damages actions in state court when it is not clear the\nstatute does any such thing. By doing so, the Court gives short\nshrift to the \u201cwell-established principle governing the prudent\nexercise of this Court\u2019s jurisdiction that normally the Court will\nnot decide a constitutional question if there is some other ground\nupon which to dispose of the case.\u201dNorthwest Austin Municipal\nUtil. Dist. No. Onev.Holder,557\nU.S. 193, 205 (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted).BHaving interpreted USERRA to render\nnonconsenting States amenable to suit, the Court goes on to\ndistinguishAldenv.Mainewithout any plausible\nbasis for doing so. In truth,Aldendirectly controls this\ncase.InAlden, a group of private plaintiffs\nsued the State of Maine in state court, invoking a private cause of\naction created by the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). See 527\nU.\u00a0S., at 711\u2013712. The question presented was \u201cwhether\nCongress has the power, under Article I, to subject nonconsenting\nStates to private suits in their own courts.\u201dId.,at 730.\nIn a detailed opinion, the Court inAldenheld\u2014without\nqualification\u2014that the States had not consented in the plan of the\nConvention toanycongressionally created private damages\nactions in state court.To begin,Aldenframed its inquiry around\nplan-of-the-Convention waiver, not congressional abrogation: \u201cIn\nexercising its Article I powers Congress may subject the States to\nprivate suits in their own courts only if there is compelling\nevidence that the Stateswere required to surrender this power\nto Congress pursuant to the constitutional design\u201d\u2014i.e.,in the plan of the Convention.Id.,at 730\u2013731 (emphasis\nadded; internal quotation marks omitted); see alsoante,at\n4. In determining whether such evidence existed,Aldenbegan\nwith the text of the Constitution. See 527 U.\u00a0S., at 731. It\nrecognized that Article I, \u00a78, \u201cgrants .\u00a0.\u00a0. Congress\nbroad powers to enact legislation in several enumerated areas of\nnational concern\u201d\u2014including, of course, the war powers.Ibid. But neither the breadth of those powers nor their\nconnection to \u201careas of national concern\u201d sufficed to show that\nStates ratified the Constitution with the understanding that they\nhad surrendered to Congress any power to authorize private damages\nactions against them in their own courts. Seeid.,at\n731\u2013733.Aldenspoke emphatically and\ncategorically when explaining why the States had effected no such\nsurrender. We found it telling that \u201cno one, not even the\nConstitution\u2019s most ardent opponents, suggested the document might\nstrip the States of the[ir] immunity\u201d from suit \u201cin their own\ncourts.\u201dId.,at 741. That was likely because \u201cthe\nsovereign\u2019s right to assert immunity from suit in its own courts\nwas a principle so well established thatno one conceived it\nwould be altered by the new Constitution.\u201dIbid.(emphasis added). We explained how the founding generation\u2019s\nconcern that \u201cArticle III might be used to circumvent state-court\nimmunity\u201d counseled against \u201cinfer[ring] that the Constitution\nstripped the States of immunity in their own courts and allowed\nCongress to subject them to suit there.\u201dId.,at 743.\nRather, in light of the historical record, we found it \u201cdifficult\nto conceive that the Constitution would have been adopted if it had\nbeen understood to strip the States of immunity from suit in their\nown courts and cede to the Federal Government a power to subject\nnonconsenting States to private suits in these fora.\u201dIbid.Importantly, the scope ofAlden\u2019s holding\nwas broad: \u201cWe hold that the powers delegated to Congress under\nArticle I of the United States Constitution do not include the\npower to subject nonconsenting States to private suits for damages\nin state courts.\u201dId.,at 712; see alsoid.,at 754.\nThat holding plainly applied toallArticle I powers. Thus,\nwe did not engage in a clause-by-clause parsing of Article I\u2019s\nvarious powers, nor did we even mention which Article I power\nauthorized the FLSA. It did not matter because the States would not\nhave surrendered to Congressanyof the immunity they\nenjoyed in their own courts.Finally, concluding its analysis,Aldencontrasted the States\u2019 amenability to suit \u201cby the United States on\nbehalf of the employees\u201d with a suit \u201cby the employees\u201d themselves,\nholding that \u201chistory, precedent, and the structure of the\nConstitution make clear that,under the plan of the\nConvention, the States have consented to suits of the first\nkind but not of the second.\u201dId.,at 759\u2013760 (emphasis\nadded).[3] The question thatAldenanswered plainly embraces the one that the Court\nanswers today. And there is no serious dispute thatAlden\u2019s\nexplicit holding is irreconcilable with the Court\u2019s holding\nhere.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*Until today,Aldenmeant what it said.\nBothKatzandPennEastconsidered\nplan-of-the-Convention waivers applicable to federal, not state,\ncourt. SeeKatz, 546 U.\u00a0S., at 360;PennEast,\n594 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 4). Nothing in those\ndecisions, therefore, underminedAlden\u2019s categorical\nholding.[4] It is only the\nCourt\u2019s holding today that does so. I would adhere toAldenand reaffirm that the States did not surrender the immunity\napplicable in their own courts when they delegated the enumerated\npowers\u2014including the war powers\u2014to Congress in Article I. And,\nbecause Torres has not invoked a waiver of immunity under state\nlaw, I would affirm the judgment of the Texas Court of Appeals.IIIEven ifAlden\u2019s holding were not alone\ndispositive, thus requiring us to consider our \u201cplan of the\nConvention\u201d precedents applicable to private actionsin federal\ncourt, I would still conclude that the States have not waived\ntheir immunity to private damages actions authorized by the war\npowers.Our settled test for plan-of-the-Convention\nwaiver is a stringent one: We cannot infer a waiver of sovereign\nimmunity unless there is \u201ccompelling evidence that the Founders\nthought such a surrender inherent in the constitutional compact.\u201dBlatchford, 501 U.\u00a0S., at 781; see alsoAlden,\n527 U.\u00a0S., at 731. \u201cCompelling evidence\u201d of this sort includes\n\u201cevidence of the original understanding of the Constitution,\u201did., at 741, \u201cearly congressional practice,\u201did.,at\n743, \u201cthe structure of the Constitution\u201d itself,id.,at\n748, and the \u201ctheory and reasoning of our earlier cases,\u201did.,at 745; see alsoid.,at 754.Applying this test, it is clear that the States\ndid not implicitly agree to surrender their state-court immunity\nagainst congressional exercises of the war powers.ATorres claims (and the Court agrees) that the\noriginal understanding of the Constitution\u2019s text implies that the\nStates agreed to surrender their immunity against private actions\nauthorized by Congress\u2019 \u201cwar powers,\u201d which include eight powers\nenumerated in Article I, \u00a78, along with the Necessary and Proper\nClause. See Brief for Petitioner 4 (invoking Art. I, \u00a78, cls. 1,\n10\u201316, 18); see alsoante,at 7 (listing Art. I, \u00a78, cls. 1,\n11\u201316). In support of that argument, Torres and the Court point out\nthat the war powers delegated to Congress are sweeping, and that\nArticle I, \u00a710, expressly and completely divests States of various\nwar-related powers. Seeante,at 7\u20138; Brief for Petitioner\n24. This argument falters on at least two fronts.First,Seminole Tribelong ago explained\nthat the breadth and exclusivity of a federal power does not\nauthorize Congress to subject nonconsenting States to private\ndamages actions.Seminole Tribeinvolved a federal cause of\naction created pursuant to Congress\u2019 authority under the Indian\nCommerce Clause, see 517 U.\u00a0S., at 60, which this Court has\nsaid grants Congress \u201c\u00a0\u2018plenary and exclusive\u2019\u00a0\u201d \u201cpowers\nto legislate in respect to Indian tribes,\u201dUnited Statesv.Lara,541 U.S.\n193, 200 (2004). AlthoughSeminole Triberecognized that\nStates had been \u201cdivested of virtually all authority over Indian\ncommerce and Indian tribes,\u201d 517 U.\u00a0S., at 62, the Court\nnonetheless held that \u201cstate sovereign immunity .\u00a0.\u00a0. is\nnot so ephemeral as to dissipate when the subject of the suit is an\narea .\u00a0.\u00a0. that is under the exclusive control of the\nFederal Government,\u201did.,at 72. That \u201cthe Constitution\nvests in Congress complete lawmaking authority over a particular\narea,\u201d we explained, does not implicitly authorize Congress to\nabrogate immunity with respect to that power.Ibid.[5]Nor is the answer different when the exclusive\nfederal exercise of a particular power is reinforced by an explicit\ndivestment of state authority under Article I, \u00a710. Our precedents\nteach that whenever a power is \u201cexercised exclusively by Congress,\nthe subject is as completely taken from the State Legislatures,as if they had been expressly forbidden to act on it.\u201dSturgesv.Crowninshield, 4 Wheat. 122, 193 (1819)\n(Marshall, C.\u00a0J., for the Court) (emphasis added). Whether or\nnot a prohibition on state poweralsoappears in Article I,\n\u00a710, is irrelevant when deciding whether the Constitution has\ngranted Congress power to subject nonconsenting States to private\nsuits.Second, even if express textual divestment of\nstate power were relevant, Torres and the Court incorrectly\nconclude that the specific divestments listed in Article I, \u00a710,\n\u201cprovide strong evidence\u201d supporting \u201ca complete delegation of\nauthority to the Federal Government to provide for the common\ndefense.\u201dAnte,at 7. States obviously have no authority to\ntake certain actions specified in Article I, \u00a710. They cannot, for\nexample, \u201ckeep Troops, or Ships of War in time of Peace\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. unless actually invaded, or in such imminent Danger\nas will not admit of delay\u201d without the consent of Congress. Art.\nI, \u00a710, cl. 3. But to say that Congress\u2019 much more general\nauthority to \u201craise and support Armies,\u201d Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 12, acts\nto completely derogate all state authority related to the subject\nis inaccurate.States have significant residual police powers\nthat overlap with Congress\u2019 power over the military. For example,\nwe have sustained state legislation related to the enlistment of\nmen in the U.\u00a0S. Army and Navy against the charge that\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018all power of legislation regarding the subject matter\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. is conferred upon Congress and withheld from the\nStates.\u2019\u00a0\u201dGilbertv.Minnesota,254 U.S.\n325, 327\u2013328 (1920). In doing so, we rejected the idea \u201cthat a\nState has no interest or concern in the United States or its armies\nor power of protecting them from public enemies,\u201d and eschewed any\n\u201c[c]old and technical reasoning\u201d that \u201cinsist[s] on a separation of\nthe sovereignties\u201d in the army-raising context.Id.,at\n328\u2013329. Similarly, we have held that \u201cthere is no clause of the\nConstitution which purports, unaided by Congressional enactment, to\nprohibit\u201d States from exercising their police powers in ways that\narguably burden Congress\u2019 \u201cpower to raise and support armies.\u201dPenn Dairies, Inc.v.Milk Control Comm\u2019n of Pa.,318 U.S.\n261, 269 (1943). Nor have we \u201cimplied from the relationship of\nthe two governments established by the Constitution\u201d any such\nprohibition.Ibid.State regulations \u201cinevitably impos[e]\nsome burdens on the national government,\u201d but those are the \u201cnormal\nincidents of the operation within the same territory of a dual\nsystem of government,\u201d and they may persist \u201csave as Congress may\nact to remove them.\u201dId.,at 271. Therefore, even though the\nArmy and Navy Clauses grant Congress \u201cexclusive\u201d authority over\nraising and supporting armies and navies, that exclusivity is no\ndifferent from that which attends any other Article I power.To nonetheless find plan-of-the-Convention\nwaiver, as Torres proposes and the Court accepts, is to hold that a\ncongressional power to pre-empt state law alone demonstrates a\nState\u2019s surrender of sovereign immunity. That line of reasoning,\napart from being foreclosed bySeminole Tribe, proves too\nmuch. The upshot is that the States would have consented in the\nplan of the Convention to surrender their immunity against the\nexercise ofanyArticle I power. Because such a result is a\ndramatic departure from our precedents, and the power granted to\nCongress under the Army and Navy Clauses does not displace state\nregulation any more readily or completely than other Article I\npowers, these arguments from constitutional text provide no sound\nbasis for authorizing private actions against nonconsenting\nStates.BConstitutional history and practice do Torres\nand the Court no better. To begin, we must view the historical\nevidence in light of the \u201cpresumption that no anomalous and\nunheard-of proceedings or suits were intended to be raised up by\nthe Constitution.\u201dHans, 134 U.\u00a0S., at 18; see alsoAlden, 527 U.\u00a0S., at 727. Applying that presumption,\nthe Court in the past has \u201cattribute[d] great significance\u201d to the\nabsence of analogous suits \u201cat the time of the founding or for many\nyears thereafter.\u201dFederal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 535 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 755.[6] Moreover, the\npresumption is arguably at its strongest here, for private damages\nactions were precisely \u201cthe type of proceedings from which the\nFramers would have thought the States possessed immunity.\u201dId.,at 756. The Framers would have \u201cthought it an\nimpermissible affront to a State\u2019s dignity\u201d to require it \u201cto\ndefend itself in an adversarial proceeding against a private\nparty.\u201dId.,at 760\u2013761.To overcome that presumption, Torres and the\nCourt invoke some historical sources that generally discuss the\nscope and importance of Congress\u2019 war-related powers. See Brief for\nPetitioner 26\u201337;ante,at 8\u20139. But virtually none of them\naddresses directly the central question here: whether the States\nunderstood that they had surrendered their sovereign immunity from\nsuit in their own courts when delegating those powers to Congress.\nInstead, the founding-era history is largely silent on this\nquestion, and that \u201csilence is most instructive\u201d in confirming that\n\u201cno one conceived that [state sovereign immunity] would be altered\nby the new Constitution[\u2019s]\u201d distribution of war powers.Alden, 527 U.\u00a0S., at 741. \u201c[T]he Founders\u2019 silence is\nbest explained by the simple fact that no one .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nsuggested the document might strip the States of [their] immunity\u201d\nunder the war powers.Ibid.More specifically, Torres (but not the Court)\npoints to the 1783 Treaty of Paris. He maintains that private\nactions would not have been anomalous to the Founders because they\nexpected British creditors to sue States under the treaty in order\nto collect on their debts. See Brief for Petitioner 27\u201331. But it\nis not likely that the Founders did, in fact, expect foreign\ncreditor suits against States; \u201cit is more likely that they\nexpected creditors to sue their individual debtors and rely on the\nTreaty to defeat any state law defenses.\u201d B. Clark, The Eleventh\nAmendment and the Nature of the Union, 123 Harv. L.\u00a0Rev. 1817,\n1910 (2010). And when the Eleventh Amendment was adopted \u201cto\nrestore the original constitutional design\u201d afterChisholmv.Georgia, 2 Dall. 419 (1793),Alden, 527\nU.\u00a0S., at 722, Congress refused \u201cto make an exception for\ncases arising under treaties made under the authority of the United\nStates,\u201did.,at 721 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\u201cCongress\u2019 refusal to modify the text of the Eleventh Amendment to\ncreate an exception to sovereign immunity for cases arising under\ntreaties\u201d suggests that the States\u2019 immunity from private-party\nlitigation extended even to treaty-based claims.Id.,at\n735; see also D. Currie, The Constitution in Congress: The\nFederalist Period 1789\u20131801, p. 197 (1997).Early congressional practice accords with the\nFramers\u2019 assumption that Congress could not use any Article I power\nto subject the States to private damages actions in their own\ncourts. In fact, we already have \u201cdiscovered no instance in which\n[early Congresses] purported to authorize suits against\nnonconsenting States in [state courts].\u201dAlden, 527\nU.\u00a0S., at 744. Contrasted against the numerous statutes\nauthorizing other federal suits in state courts, it \u201cappears early\nCongresses did not believe they had the power to authorize private\nsuits against the States in their own courts.\u201dIbid.CConstitutional structure also cuts decisively\nagainst inferring a surrender of state sovereign immunity in this\ncontext. Seeid.,at 748\u2013754.First and most fundamentally, all private suits\nagainst nonconsenting States present \u201c\u00a0\u2018the indignity of\nsubjecting a State to the coercive process of judicial tribunals at\nthe instance of private parties.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId., at 749\n(quotingIn\u00a0re Ayers,123 U.S.\n443, 505 (1887)). USERRA\u2019s cause of action is uniquely\noffensive to the States\u2019 dignity because it purports \u201cto press a\nState\u2019s own courts into federal service to coerce the other\nbranches of the State,\u201d thereby \u201cturn[ing] the State against\nitself\u00a0\u201d and \u201ccommandeer[ing] the entire political machinery\nof the State against its will and at the behest of individuals.\u201dAlden, 527 U.\u00a0S., at 749. That kind of \u201cplenary federal\ncontrol of state governmental processes denigrates the separate\nsovereignty of the States.\u201dIbid.Second, congressional authorization of private\ndamages actions \u201cthreaten[s] the financial integrity of the\nStates.\u201dId.,at 750. It can \u201ccreate staggering burdens\u201d and\ngive \u201cCongress a power and a leverage over the States that is not\ncontemplated by our constitutional design.\u201dIbid.Third, representative government itself is\njeopardized when \u201cdeliberation by the political process established\nby the citizens of the State\u201d is replaced with \u201cjudicial decree\nmandated by the Federal Government and invoked by the private\ncitizen.\u201dId.,at 751. Political accountability\u2014\u201cessential\nto our liberty and republican form of government\u201d\u2014breaks down when\n\u201cthe Federal Government asserts authority over a State\u2019s most\nfundamental political processes.\u201dIbid.[7]Notwithstanding these countervailing structural\nconcerns, both Torres and the Court think that constitutional\nstructure supports finding plan-of-the-Convention waiver because\nconfirming States\u2019 sovereign immunity in their own courts would\nsupposedly threaten the Federal Government\u2019s \u201cpower to wage war\nsuccessfully\u201d and jeopardize the Nation\u2019s safety.Ante,at\n11 (quotingLichterv.United States,334 U.S.\n742, 780 (1948); internal quotation marks omitted); Brief for\nPetitioner 26. But this argument conflates the preservation of\nstate sovereign immunity with a license to interfere with federal\nwarmaking. As we already cautioned inAlden, \u201cThe\nconstitutional privilege of a State to assert its sovereign\nimmunity in its own courts does not confer upon the State a\nconcomitant right to disregard the Constitution or valid federal\nlaw.\u201d 527 U.\u00a0S., at 754\u2013755.For example, the Court notes that early\nCongresses \u201cestablished military bonuses to reward service, even\nrequiring Virginia to give land to some Revolutionary War\nofficers.\u201dAnte,at 9 (citing Act of Aug. 10, 1790, ch. 40,\n1Stat. 182).[8] It asks,\nincredulously, \u201cCould Virginia have refused to go along?\u201dAnte,at 9. But that question is a non sequitur. No one\ndisputes \u201cthe supremacy of federal power in the area of military\naffairs.\u201dPerpichv.Department of Defense,496 U.S.\n334, 351 (1990). Instead, all agree that the United States\ncould lawfully sue Virginia in federal court to secure an\ninjunction requiring it to comply with federal law. In fact, USERRA\nalready authorizes suits by the United States to enforce USERRA\u2019s\nrequirements. \u00a74323(a)(1). And even if private suits were necessary\nto enforce the federal scheme, individuals could still sue in\nequity to enjoin state officials from violating federal law, seeEx\u00a0parte Young,209 U.S.\n123(1908), or, if Congress authorizes it, pursue damages\nactions against such state officials in their individual\ncapacities, see,e.g.,Rev. Stat. \u00a71979, 42\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71983. Ultimately, if the Court reaffirmed\nTexas\u2019 sovereign immunity, \u201c[e]stablished rules provide ample means\nto correct ongoing violations of law and to vindicate the interests\nwhich animate the Supremacy Clause.\u201dAlden, 527 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 757.DFinally, our precedents do not support finding\na surrender of state sovereign immunity here. As explained above,Aldenis the most on-point precedent\u2014and, in fact, our only\nrecent precedent discussing States\u2019 immunity from suit in their own\ncourts. It therefore disposes of this case. NeitherKatznorPennEastsupports a different result.Katzfound plan-of-the-Convention waiver\nbased on the \u201csingular nature\u201d of bankruptcy jurisdiction and \u201cthe\nBankruptcy Clause\u2019s unique history.\u201d 546 U.\u00a0S., at 369,\nn.\u00a09. As the Court later explained,Katz\u201cviewed\nbankruptcy as on a different plane, governed by principles all its\nown,\u201d and nothing in its analysis \u201cinvites the kind of general,\nclause-by-clause reexamination of Article I\u201d that the Court\nendorses today.Allenv.Cooper, 589 U.\u00a0S. ___,\n___ (2020) (slip op., at 9) (internal quotation marks omitted).For its part,PennEastemphasized several\nfactors unique to the eminent domain context. First,PennEastdiscussed the Federal Government\u2019s long history of\nexercising the power of eminent domain\u2014including its delegation of\nthat power to private parties to take property within state\nboundaries. See 594 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 7). Here,\nthere is a long history showing that the Federal Government\nexercised its war powers, but there is no comparable history of the\nFederal Government using those powers to impose financial\nliabilities on States enforceable by private parties. Nor is there\nany evidence demonstrating that any kind of judicial\nproceedings\u2014let alone private damages actions\u2014are \u201cinextricably\nintertwined\u201d with the war powers in the way that judicial\ncondemnation actions are intertwined with eminent domain. Seesupra,at 14\u201315, n. 6.Second,PennEastemphasized that the\nConstitution vests the Federal Government \u201c\u00a0\u2018with full and\ncomplete power to execute and carry out its\npurposes\u2019\u00a0\u201d\u2014including the power of eminent domain\u2014and that\nhistory shows that the Government may exercise that sovereign power\nthrough private delegatees. 594 U.\u00a0S.,at ___ (slip\nop., at 15). Here, there is no argument that employees granted a\ncause of action under USERRA are \u201cdelegatees\u201d of the war powers in\nany meaningful sense.Third,PennEastreasoned that recognizing\nNew Jersey\u2019s immunity claim would require federal delegatees to\ntake state property, thereby forcing States to file inverse\ncondemnation actions for just compensation. Seeid., at ___\n(slip op., at 17). The Court did not think that kind of arrangement\n\u201cwould vindicate the principles underlying state sovereign\nimmunity,\u201d including the principle of affording States \u201cthe respect\nowed them as joint sovereigns.\u201dIbid.(internal quotation\nmarks omitted). Here, by contrast, there is no sense in which\nconfirming Texas\u2019 immunity would similarly undermine the principles\nunderlying that immunity.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*In the end, the \u201chistory, practice, precedent,\nand the structure of the Constitution\u201d all demonstrate that States\ndid not surrender their sovereign immunity in their own courts when\nCongress legislates pursuant to one of its war powers.Alden, 527 U.\u00a0S., at 741, 754.IVThe Court nevertheless holds that States\nsurrendered their sovereign immunity for any congressional causes\nof action passed pursuant to Article I\u2019s Army and Navy Clauses.Ante,at 11\u201312.[9] To\nreach that conclusion, the Court adopts a test that even Torres did\nnot press. Relying exclusively onPennEast, the Court\nmaintains that plan-of-the-Convention waiver distills to a single\nquestion: whether the federal power at issue is \u201c\u00a0\u2018complete in\nitself.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAnte,at 6 (quotingPennEast, 594\nU.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 22)). If so, then the States have\nsurrendered their sovereign immunity against any exercises of that\npower. After framing the inquiry this way, the Court concludes that\nbecause Congress\u2019 \u201cpower to build and maintain the Armed Forces\u201d is\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018complete in itself,\u2019\u00a0\u201d States necessarily relinquished\ntheir sovereign immunity against private damages actions authorized\nby that power.Ante,at 6, 11.In my view, the Court is asking the wrong\nquestion. It unjustifiably asserts that the entire\nplan-of-the-Convention inquiry rests on whether a power is\n\u201ccomplete in itself.\u201d Further, its \u201ccomplete in itself\u00a0\u201d\nstandard misreadsPenn-East, which suggested only that\nbecause the federal eminent domain power was \u201ccomplete in\nitself\u00a0\u201d and, by its nature, \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with\njudicial condemnation proceedings, States surrendered any sovereign\nimmunity that would otherwise render the eminent domain power\nincomplete.PennEast, 594 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at\n17). By saddling \u201ccompleteness\u201d with more analytical weight than it\ncan bear, the Court has devised a method that has the certainty and\nobjectivity of a Rorschach test. Beyond its inconsistency withPennEast, this contrivance also threatens to rework or erase\nthe Court\u2019s prevailing sovereign immunity jurisprudence.AThe sentence inPennEastupon which the\nCourt fabricates its test for plan-of-the-Convention waiver reads\nas follows: \u201c[T]he federal eminent domain power is \u2018complete in\nitself,\u2019 and the States consented to the exercise of that power\u2014in\nits entirety\u2014in the plan of the Convention.\u201d 594 U.\u00a0S., at ___\n(slip op., at 22) (quotingKohlv.United States,91 U.S.\n367, 374 (1876); citation omitted). The Court today claims that\nthis sentence inPennEastreduced our decades-old State\nsovereign immunity jurisprudence to merely asking whether a federal\npower is \u201ccomplete in itself.\u201d That cannot be correct.The Court inPennEastborrowed the\n\u201ccomplete in itself\u00a0\u201d idea fromKohl, which had\napproved the Federal Government\u2019s condemnation of private land to\nbuild a post office in Cincinnati, Ohio. 91 U.\u00a0S., at 373\u2013374.\nAlthough the Federal Government had relied on Ohio\u2019s eminent domain\npower, rather than its own,Kohlmade clear that the Federal\nGovernment\u2019s authority to condemn land did not depend upon state\nlaw. In doing so,Kohlstated that \u201c[i]f the United States\nhave the [eminent domain] power, it must be complete in itself.\u201dId.,at 374. \u201cIt can neither be enlarged nor diminished by a\nState. Nor can any State prescribe the manner in which it must be\nexercised. The consent of a State can never be a condition\nprecedent to its enjoyment.\u201dIbid.BeforePennEast, the phrase \u201ccomplete in\nitself\u00a0\u201d never appeared in our modern state sovereign immunity\nprecedents.PennEastitself invoked the concept for one\npurpose: to reject the contention that one could \u201c[s]eparat[e] the\neminent domain power from the power to condemn\u201d\u2014i.e.,to\ndisaggregate those \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d powers\u2014when\ndetermining whether the history of federal eminent domain supported\nfinding a waiver of state sovereign immunity. 594 U.\u00a0S., at\n___ (slip op., at 17). According toPennEast, to deprive the\nFederal Government of a power to condemn property in judicial\nproceedings brought by private delegatees would be tantamount to\ndepriving the Government of part of the eminent domain power\nitself, contrary toKohl\u2019s characterization of that power as\n\u201ccomplete in itself.\u201d 594 U.\u00a0S., at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at\n17\u201318).The Court today errs by attributing toKohlan outsized role inPennEast\u2019s sovereign\nimmunity analysis. The Court inPennEastnever stated that\n\u201ccompleteness in itself\u00a0\u201d represented the governing test for\nplan-of-the-Convention waiver. Likewise,PennEastmade no\neffort to explain how the \u201ccomplete in itself\u00a0\u201d inquiry would\nwork beyond the context of eminent domain. And becausePennEastdid not invokeKohlto break new doctrinal\nground, the Court made no attempt to reconcile the \u201ccomplete in\nitself\u00a0\u201d inquiry with this Court\u2019s longstanding sovereign\nimmunity precedents (e.g.,Alden,Seminole\nTribe,Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n,Hans, etc.).\nAgain, ifPennEasthad made \u201ccompleteness in itself\u00a0\u201d\nthe applicable test, surely the Court would have discussed the\nconcept more thoroughly.The Court compounds its overreading ofPennEast\u2019s \u201ccomplete in itself\u00a0\u201d language by\nunjustifiably dismissingPennEast\u2019s \u201cinextricably\nintertwined\u201d rationale as a mere \u201ctechnical aspect\u201d of the\ndecision.Ante,at 15.PennEastis best read to stand\nfor the proposition that, because every federal power must be\n\u201ccomplete in itself,\u201d the States surrendered their sovereign\nimmunity with respect to any federal power that is \u201cinextricably\nintertwined\u201d with judicial proceedings, like eminent domain;\notherwise, sovereign immunity would excuse the States from the\njudicial proceeding and the federal power would be incomplete.PennEast, 594 U.\u00a0S., at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 16\u201317)\n(linking completeness of eminent domain power to condemnation\nproceedings). Yet, now, the Court abandons the only limiting\nprinciple inPennEast\u2019s test.[10]That is mistaken. To begin with, disaggregating\nthe \u201ccomplete in itself\u00a0\u201d standard fromPennEast\u2019s\n\u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d justification renders meaningless the\nidea of \u201ccompleteness\u201d in the context of state sovereign immunity.\nConsider the Court\u2019s opinion here, which says that any federal\npower \u201ccomplete in itself\u00a0\u201d must be accompanied with a\nsurrender of state sovereign immunity. The Court does not define\nwhat it means for a federal power to be \u201ccomplete in itself,\u201d\nexcept that \u201c\u00a0\u2018the States consented to the exercise of that\npower\u2014in its entirety\u2014in the plan of the Convention.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAnte,at 6 (quotingPennEast, 594 U.\u00a0S., at ___\n(slip op., at 22)). But that self-referential definition begs the\nquestion. If the Court tied the \u201ccompleteness\u201d of a federal power\nto an inherent connection with judicial proceedings, it could give\nthe term independent meaning and make sense ofPennEast\u2019s\nactual analysis.Worse still, today\u2019s decision removes the one\nimportant guardrail on the \u201ccompleteness\u201d inquiry thatPennEastdescribed. Absent that limit, the Court\u2019s\nindefinite test will provide future courts cover to further erode\nthe States\u2019 sovereign immunity.BTo the extent that the Court\u2019s new \u201ccomplete\nin itself\u00a0\u201d standard has any definable contours, it is\ninconsistent with our modern sovereign immunity doctrine and, in\nparticular,Seminole Tribe.As I noted above, the Court does not define what\nit means for a federal power to be \u201ccomplete in itself\u00a0\u201d underPennEastandKohl. All we are told is that eminent\ndomain and the powers to raise and support armies and navies are\npowers \u201ccomplete\u201d in themselves. Seeante,at 6, 11.The Court\u2019s \u201ccompleteness\u201d standard is\nindeterminate in large part because the Court fails to recognize\nthat the concept of a federal power being \u201ccomplete in\nitself\u00a0\u201d long predatesKohland means something quite\ndifferent from what the Court says it does. In fact, the phrase\u2019s\nprovenance in our jurisprudence dates back to no less seminal a\ndecision than Chief Justice Marshall\u2019s opinion inGibbonsv.Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1 (1824). There, the Court stated that\nCongress\u2019 power \u201c[t]o regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and\namong the several States,\u201d U.\u00a0S. Const., Art. I, \u00a78,\ncl.\u00a03, \u201clike all others vested in Congress,is complete in\nitself, may be exercised to its utmost extent, and acknowledges\nno limitations, other than are prescribed in the constitution,\u201d 9\nWheat., at 196 (emphasis added).Gibbons\u2019 discussion is revealing. First,\nunlike the Court\u2019s decision today, which attempts to cabin\ncongressional powers that are \u201ccomplete in themselves\u201d to only a\nfew,Gibbonsis explicit that it consideredeverypower vested in Congress to be \u201ccomplete in itself.\u201dIbid.That understanding would explain whyKohlsaid that \u201c[i]f\nthe United States have the power, itmustbe complete in\nitself.\u201d 91 U.\u00a0S., at 374 (emphasis added). Second, unlike the\nCourt today,Gibbonsdefines what it means for a power to be\ncomplete in itself\u2014the power \u201cmay be exercised to its utmost\nextent\u201d with \u201cno limitations\u201d beyond those in Constitution itself.\n9 Wheat.,at 196. In other words, the power is plenary as to\nthose subjects to which it applies. Seeid.,at 197.Gibbons\u2019 understanding of a congressional\npower being \u201ccomplete in itself\u00a0\u201d was repeated by this Court\ntime and time again for nearly two centuries. Almost always, the\nCourt used the term to refer to Congress\u2019 authority to regulate\ninterstate and foreign commerce.[11] And, over time, the Court confirmed that because\nCongress\u2019 power over interstate commerce \u201cis plenary and complete\nin itself .\u00a0.\u00a0. [i]t follows that no form of state\nactivity can constitutionally thwart the regulatory power granted\nby the commerce clause to Congress.\u201dUnited Statesv.Wrightwood Dairy Co.,315 U.S.\n110, 119 (1942); see alsoWickardv.Filburn,317 U.S.\n111, 124 (1942). This language echoesKohl\u2019s holding\nthat the federal eminent domain power \u201ccan neither be enlarged nor\ndiminished by a State.\u201d 91 U.\u00a0S., at 374.Ignoring this long history about the very\n\u201ccompleteness\u201d standard that it purports to apply, the Court grasps\nfor some basis to explain how its decision is consistent with this\nCourt\u2019s understanding of Congress\u2019 commerce power inSeminole\nTribe.It asserts that Congress\u2019 power under the Army and Navy\nClauses is somehow \u201ccomplete in itself\u00a0\u201d while its power under\nthe Commerce Clause is less than \u201ccomplete\u201d because \u201cfederal\nregulation of commerce (at issue inSeminole Tribe) involves\ngoods that, before they travel between States or outside a tribe,\nare subject to regulation by a sovereign other than the Federal\nGovernment (a State or tribe).\u201dAnte,at 13.But the Court\u2019s proposed distinction makes no\nsense. For one, it conflicts with the Court\u2019s longstanding\ncharacterization of Congress\u2019 commerce power as plenary. See,e.g.,Armour & Co.v.Virginia,246 U.S.\n1, 6 (1918). As long as the goods mentioned by the Court are in\nfact part of \u201cinterstate commerce,\u201d then Congress has authority to\nregulate their travelat all times. For another, it does\nnothing to distinguish Congress\u2019 commerce power from its power to\nraise and maintain a military. Following the Court\u2019s logic, one\ncould just as easily say that Congress\u2019 power under the Army and\nNavy Clauses is \u201cless than complete\u201d because \u201cfederal regulation of\nsoldiers involves men and women who, before they join the military,\nare subject to regulation by a sovereignotherthan the\nFederal Government.\u201d Despite the Court\u2019s efforts, its\n\u201ccompleteness\u201d analysis simply fails to distinguish the Army and\nNavy Clauses from other Article I powers delegated to Congress in\nthe plan of the Convention.[12]Most troubling, however, is the clear parallel\nbetween the Court\u2019s analysis today and the discredited approach to\nsovereign immunity that we rejected inSeminole Tribe. For\nexample, inPardenv.Terminal R.\u00a0Co. of Ala. Docks\nDept.,377 U.S.\n184(1964), the Court relied onGibbons\u2019 \u201ccomplete in\nitself\u00a0\u201d language to hold that \u201cthe States surrendered a\nportion of their sovereignty when they granted Congress the power\nto regulate commerce.\u201dId.,at 191; see alsoid.,at\n192.Pardenreasoned, not unlike the Court today, that\n\u201c[t]he sovereign power of the states is necessarily diminished to\nthe extent of the grants of power to the federal government in the\nConstitution,\u201d and that granting Congress \u201cplenary power to\nregulate commerce\u201d amounts to a surrender of immunity.Id.,at 191 (internal quotation marks omitted).Similarly, inPennsylvaniav.Union\nGas Co.,491 U.S. 1(1989), the plurality emphasized how \u201c[i]t would be difficult to\noverstate the breadth and depth of the commerce power,\u201did.,at 20, and how the \u201c[t]he Commerce Clause with one hand gives power\nto Congress while, with the other, it takes power away from the\nStates,\u201did.,at 16. In light of this dual grant of federal\nauthority and divestment of state authority, the plurality thought\nCongress\u2019 commerce power \u201cwould beincompletewithout the\nauthority to render States liable in damages.\u201dId.,at 19\n(emphasis added). To complete that congressional power, the\nplurality reasoned that \u201cto the extent that the States gave\nCongress the authority to regulate commerce, they also relinquished\ntheir immunity where Congress found it necessary, in exercising\nthis authority, to render them liable.\u201dId.,at 19\u201320.We repudiatedPardenand overruledUnion GasinSeminole Tribe.See 517 U.\u00a0S., at\n66; see alsoCollege Savings Bankv.Florida Prepaid\nPostsecondary Ed.

Hopefully, the Court will someday purge\nthe newly fashioned \u201ccompleteness\u201d standard from our\njurisprudence.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\u201cCongress has ample means to ensure compliance\nwith valid federal laws, but it must respect the sovereignty of the\nStates.\u201dAlden, 527 U.\u00a0S., at 758. If the Court\u2019s\nreading of USERRA is correct\u2014and I am unsure it is, seesupra,at 5\u20137\u2014then Congress has not \u201caccord[ed] States the\nesteem due to them as joint participants in a federal system.\u201d 527\nU.\u00a0S., at 758. To nonetheless deem USERRA constitutional, the\nCourt brushes aside a 23-year-old, pathbreaking precedent, while\nelevating a single phrase, made in passing in a one-year-old,\nhighly circumscribed precedent. It then uses that phrase to fashion\na test for plan-of-the-Convention waiver that mimics earlier\nattempts by this Court to deny States the dignity owed to them in\nour system of dual federalism.Our sovereign States deserved better. I\nrespectfully dissent.Notes1To be sure, if USERRA\nauthorizes suits in state courts only \u201cin accordance with the laws\nof the State,\u201d the ability to bring such actions would vary by\nState\u2014some States would consent to suit, others would not, and\nstill others would be amenable to suit under the Supremacy Clause\nbecause their state courts were authorized to hear analogous\nstate-law actions against the State. See,e.g.,Testav.Katt,330 U.S.\n386, 394 (1947). But there is nothing strange about that lack\nof uniformity; in fact, a House Subcommittee considering the effect\nofSeminoleTribe of Fla.v.Florida,517 U.S.\n44(1996), on USERRA heard testimony suggesting that might be\nhow things worked if covered employees sued in state courts. See\nHearing on USERRA et\u00a0al. before the Subcommittee on Education,\nTraining, Employment and Housing of the House Committee on\nVeterans\u2019 Affairs, 104th Cong., 2d Sess., 90 (1996) (explaining\nthat \u201cthe rights of state employees to recover under the USERRA\nmight vary from state to state\u201d).2The Court invokes 38\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a74302(b) to bolster its interpretation of \u00a74323,\nseeante,at 12, but that provision supersedes only those\nstate laws that abridge the \u201cright[s]\u201d and \u201cbenefit[s]\u201d defined in\n\u00a74303(2). \u00a74302(b). Those \u201crights and benefits\u201d are \u201call\nsubstantive rights\u201d; they do not \u201cdeal with the procedure or\nprocess for enforcing those rights and benefits.\u201dWysockiv.International Bus. Machine Corp., 607 F.3d 1102, 1106\u20131107\n(CA6 2010). Meanwhile, \u00a74323 clearly applies to procedure and\nprocess and its plain text\u2014\u201cin accordance with the laws of the\nState\u201d\u2014gives no hint that Congress meant to supersede state laws\ngoverning state sovereign immunity in state courts.3The Court ignores all of\nthis and instead invokes inapposite language elsewhere inAlden. For instance, the Court emphasizes thatAldenexpressly recognized \u201c\u00a0\u2018the postulate that States\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. shall be immune from suits, without their consent,save where there has been \u201ca surrender of this immunity in the\nplan of the convention.\u201d\u00a0\u2019\u00a0\u201dAnte,at 14\n(quotingAlden, 527 U.\u00a0S., at 730). That is true\nenough, but beside the point. After stating this \u201cpostulate,\u201dAldenexhaustively evaluated constitutional history,\nprecedent, and structure and expressly held that the States,\n\u201cunder the plan of the Convention, .\u00a0.\u00a0. have\n[not] consented to suits\u201d filed by private individuals in state\ncourt.Id.,at 759\u2013760 (emphasis added).4The Court asserts that\n\u201cthose opinions\u2019 reasoning .\u00a0.\u00a0. is not so lim-ited\u201d to\nrender them inapplicable to state courts.Ante,at 15. But\nthe reasoning inKatzis necessarily limited to federal\ncourts, given that federal district courts have \u201coriginal and\nexclusive jurisdiction\u201d over all bankruptcy proceedings under Title\n11. 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71334(a). Nor is it probable thatPennEastsilently carved an exception fromAlden\u2019s\ncategorical rule. The Framers did not even think to address state\nsovereign immunity in state courts because \u201cthe sovereign\u2019s right\nto assert immunity from suit in its own courts was a principle so\nwell established that no one conceived it would be altered by the\nnew Constitution.\u201dAlden, 527 U.\u00a0S., at 741. We should\nnot readPennEastto establish, without discussion,\nsomething inconceivable to the founding generation. See 527\nU.\u00a0S., at 743. Similarly unconvincing is the Court\u2019s\nassumption that \u201cwaiver pursuant to the plan of the Convention,\u201d\nnecessarily \u201cdisplaces the background principles of state sovereign\nimmunity wherever those suits proceed.\u201dAnte,at 15. For\ninstance, we have held that \u201cthe only forums in which the States\nhave consented to suits by one another and by the Federal\nGovernmentare Article IIIcourts.\u201dFranchise Tax\nBd. of Cal.v.Hyatt, 587 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2019)\n(slip op., at 10) (emphasis added). A surrender of immunity in\nfederal court therefore does not necessarily translate to a\nsurrender of immunity in state court.5It is true thatSeminoleTribepurportedly addressed congressional\nabrogation of sovereign immunity, rather than\nplan-of-the-Convention waiver. But its logic applies equally to the\nlatter context, especially given the murky line that our precedents\ndraw between the two concepts. Seesupra, at 4.6It is true that the Court\ninPennEastPipeline Co.v.New Jersey, 594\nU.\u00a0S. ___ (2021), found plan-of-the-Convention waiver even in\n\u201cthe absence of a perfect historical analogue\u201d to private\ncondemnation suits by federal delegatees against States.Id.,at ___ (slip op., at 19). ButPennEastexcused\nthis absence of historically analogous actions because it refused\nto \u201cdivorce the eminent domain power from the power to bring\ncondemnation actions,\u201d given that \u201cthe eminent domain power is\ninextricably intertwined with the ability to condemn,\u201d and \u201cthe\nfederal eminent domain power was a means that was \u2018known and\nappropriate\u2019 at the time of the founding.\u201dId.,at ___\u2013___,\n___ (slip op., at 16\u201317, 19). Thus, thePennEastholding\nturned on the unique connection between the eminent domain power,\nthe ability to initiate condemnation proceedings, and the long\nhistory of Congress delegating its eminent domain to private\nparties. See alsoinfra, at 19\u201320.7These unique structural\ndangers posed by granting the Federal Government authority to turn\nthe State against itself again show why the Court errs in\nconcluding that precedents concerning plan-of-the-Convention\nwaivers applicable to suitsin federal courtnecessarily\nsupport waivers of immunity from suit in state court. Seeante,at 15; see alsosupra,at 10, n.\n4.8The Court\u2019s\ncharacterization of the Act of Aug. 10, 1790, as \u201crequiring\nVirginia to give land to some Revolutionary War officers\u201d \u201cat the\nexpense of state sovereignty,\u201dante, at 9, is deeply\nmisleading. Virginia had ceded the relevant lands to the United\nStates in 1784, but conditionally reserved some of it for the\nState\u2019s Revolutionary War soldiers. SeeWallacev.Parker, 6 Pet. 680, 687 (1832) (Marshall, C.\u00a0J., for\nthe Court). The 1790 Act opened up the ceded land to those\nsoldiers, and provided that the Secretary of War would send the\nVirginia Governor the names of those soldiers who were entitled to\nthe land under Virginia law. See \u00a72, 1Stat. 183. The 1790 Act also\nprovided that the land would be surveyed, that the Executive Branch\nwould draw up land patents for eligible soldiers, and that the\nSecretary of State would transmit those patents to the Virginia\nGovernor who would, in turn, deliver the patents to the grantees.\nSee \u00a7\u00a74\u20136,id., at 183\u2013184. At most, the 1790 Act required\nthe Virginia Governor only to deliver advantageous federal land\npatents to the State\u2019s own soldiers. How that statute was enacted\n\u201cat the expense of state sovereignty,\u201dante, at 9, is beyond\nme.9Although the Court lists\nthe panoply of congressional \u201cwar powers\u201d that Torres invokes, seeante,at 7, it appears to limit its holding today only to\nthe Army and Navy Clauses, seeante,at 11\u201312. In addition,\nalthough the Court\u2019s \u201ccomplete in itself\u00a0\u201d inquiry is unsound,\nseeinfra, at 22\u201329, its opinion at least suggests that\nplan-of-the-Convention waiver may be found only if (1)\u00a0the\nConstitution includes \u201cmany broad, interrelated provisions\u201d\ndelegating the relevant power to the Federal Government,ante, at 7; (2)\u00a0the Constitution expressly \u201cdivests the\nStates of like power\u201d in Article I, \u00a710,ante,at 7; and\n(3)\u00a0the power at issue is \u201cessential to the survival of the\nUnion\u201d and is \u201citself a foundational purpose\u201d for abandoning the\nArticles of Confederation and \u201cdrafting the Constitution,\u201dante, at 13. Until the Court jettisons this erroneous\ndecision from its doctrine, plan-of-the-Convention waiver would\nappear to exist only under those circumstances.10My\n\u201cquarrel\u201d therefore does not \u201cli[e] withPennEast,\u201dante,at 13, but with the Court\u2019s decision today to convertPennEast\u2019s \u201ccomplete in itself\u00a0\u201d language into an\nall-encompassing sovereign-immunity test that is divorced fromPennEast\u2019s \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d\nprinciple.11See,e.g.,Brownv.Maryland, 12 Wheat. 419, 446\n(1827) (Marshall, C.\u00a0J., for the Court) (a power \u201ccomplete in\nitself\u00a0\u201d is \u201ccoextensive with the subject on which it acts\u201d);Kiddv.Pearson,128 U.S.\n1, 17 (1888);Addyston Pipe & Steel Co.v.United\nStates,175 U.S.\n211, 228 (1899);Lottery Case,188\nU.S. 321, 347 (1903);Second Employers\u2019 Liability Cases,223 U.S.\n1, 47 (1912);Hokev.United States,227 U.S.\n308, 323 (1913);United Statesv.Carolene Products\nCo.,304 U.S.\n144, 147 (1938);United Statesv.Darby,312 U.S.\n100, 114 (1941);Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc.v.United States,379 U.S.\n241, 254\u2013255 (1964);Hodelv.Virginia Surface Mining\n& Reclamation Assn., Inc.,452 U.S.\n264, 276 (1981);United Statesv.Lopez,514 U.S.\n549, 553 (1995); see alsoSouth Carolinav.Katzenbach,383 U.S.\n301, 327 (1966) (characterizing Congress\u2019 authority under \u00a72 of\nthe Fifteenth Amendment as \u201c\u00a0\u2018complete in\nitself\u00a0\u2019\u00a0\u201d).12The\nCourt also makes what appears to be an alternative argument.\nInvoking Hamilton\u2019s discussion of state sovereignty in The\nFederalist, the Court says that States surrendered their sovereign\nimmunity where the Constitution \u201c\u00a0\u2018granted an authority to the\nUnion, to which a similar authority in the States would be\nabsolutely and totallycontradictoryandrepugnant.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAnte,at 4\u20135 (quoting The\nFederalist No. 32, p. 200 (J. Cooke ed. 1961)). The Court then\nremarks, seemingly in dicta, that \u201can assertion of state\nsovereignty to frustrate federal prerogatives to raise and maintain\nmilitary forces would be strongly \u2018contradictoryandrepugnant\u2019 to the constitutional order.\u201dAnte,at 13\n(quoting The Federalist No. 32, at 200). But that reasoning is\nhardly different from the argument made by Justice Souter when he\ndissented inSeminole Tribewith respect to the Indian\nCommerce Clause and Congress\u2019 exclusive authority in that area. See\n517 U.\u00a0S., at 148 (\u201c[S]ince the States have no sovereignty in\nthe regulation of commerce with the tribes, on Hamilton\u2019s view\nthere is no source of sovereign immunity to assert in a suit based\non congressional regulation of that commerce\u201d). Similarly, the\nCourt has often held that Congress\u2019 power to regulate interstate\nand foreign commerce is also \u201cexclusive.\u201dE.g.,Cloverleaf Butter Co.v.Patterson,315 U.S.\n148, 154\u2013155 (1942);Board of Trustees of Univ. of Ill.v.United States,289 U.S.\n48, 56\u201357 (1933). So again, the Court cannot explain how its\ninterpretation of Hamilton or its understanding of the war powers\ncoheres withSeminole Tribeand does not sweep in other\nArticle I powers like the Commerce Clause.",
