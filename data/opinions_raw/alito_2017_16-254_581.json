The purpose of that multilateral treaty is to simplify,\nstandardize, and generally improve the process of serving documents\nabroad. Preamble,ibid.; seeVolkswagenwerk\nAktiengesellschaftv.Schlunk, 486 U.\u00a0S. 694, 698\n(1988) . To that end, the Hague Service Convention specifies\ncertain approved methods of service and \u201cpre-empts inconsistent\nmethods of service\u201d wherever it applies.Id., at 699. Today\nwe address a question that has divided the lower courts: whether\nthe Convention prohibits service by mail. We hold that it does\nnot.IAPetitioner Water Splash is a corporation that\nproduces aquatic playground systems. Respondent Menon is a former\nemployee of Water Splash. In 2013, Water Splash sued Menon in state\ncourt in Texas, alleging that she had begun working for a\ncompetitor while still employed by Water Splash. 472\nS.\u00a0W.\u00a03d 28, 30 (Tex. App. 2015). Water Splash asserted\nseveral causes of action, including unfair competition, conversion,\nand tortious interference with business relations. Because Menon\nresided in Can-ada, Water Splash sought and obtained permission to\neffect service by mail.Ibid.After Menon declined to answer\nor otherwise enter an appearance, the trial court issued a default\njudgment in favor of Water Splash. Menon moved to set aside the\njudgment on the ground that she had not been properly served, but\nthe trial court denied the motion.Ibid.Menon appealed, arguing that service by mail\ndoes not \u201ccomport with the requirements of the Hague Service\nConvention.\u201dIbid.The Texas Court of Appeals majority sided\nwith Menon and held that the Convention prohibits service of\nprocess by mail.Id.,at 32. Justice Christopher dissented.Id., at 34. The Court of Appeals declined to review the\nmatter en banc, App. 95\u201396, and the Texas Supreme Court denied\ndiscretionary review,id., at 97\u201398.The disagreement between the panel majority and\nJustice Christopher tracks a broader conflict among courts as to\nwhether the Convention permits service through postal channels.\nCompare,e.g., Bankstonv. Toyota Motor Corp.,889\nF.\u00a02d 172, 173\u2013174 (CA8 1989) (holding that the Convention\nprohibits service by mail), andNuovo Pignone, SpAv.\nStorman Asia M/V,310 F.\u00a03d 374, 385 (CA5 2002) (same),\nwith, e.g.,Brockmeyerv.May, 383 F.\u00a03d\n798, 802 (CA9 2004) (holding that the Convention allows service by\nmail), andAckermannv.Levine, 788 F.\u00a02d 830,\n838\u2013840 (CA2 1986) (same). We granted certiorari to resolve that\nconflict. 580 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2016).BThe \u201cprimary innovation\u201d of the Hague Service\nConvention\u2014set out in Articles 2\u20137\u2014is that it \u201crequires each state\nto establish a central authority to receive requests for service of\ndocuments from other countries.\u201dSchlunk,supra, at\n698. When a central authority receives an appropriate request, it\nmust serve the documents or arrange for their service, Art. 5, and\nthen provide a certificate of service, Art. 6.Submitting a request to a central authority is\nnot, however, the only method of service approved by the\nConvention. For example, Article 8 permits service through\ndiplomatic and consular agents; Article 11 provides that any two\nstates can agree to methods of service not otherwise specified in\nthe Convention; and Article 19 clarifies that the Convention does\nnot preempt any internal laws of its signatories that permit\nservice from abroad via methods not otherwise allowed by the\nConvention.At issue in this case is Article 10 of the\nConvention, the English text of which reads as follows:\u201cProvided the State of destination does not\nobject, the present Convention shall not interfere with\u2014\u201c(a) the freedom to send judicial documents, by\npostal channels, directly to persons abroad,\u201c(b) the freedom of judicial officers,\nofficials or other competent persons of the State of origin to\neffect service of judicial documents directly through the judicial\nofficers, officials or other competent persons of the State of\ndestination,\u201c(c) the freedom of any person interested in a\njudicial proceeding to effect service of judicial documents\ndirectly through the judicial officers, officials or other\ncompetent persons of the State of destination.\u201d 20\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0T., at 363.Articles 10(b) and 10(c), by their plain terms,\naddress additional methods of service that are permitted by the\nConvention (unless the receiving state objects). By contrast,\nArticle 10(a) does not expressly refer to \u201cservice.\u201d The question\nin this case is whether, despite this textual difference, the\nArticle 10(a) phrase \u201csend judicial documents\u201d encompasses sending\ndocumentsfor the purposes of service.IIAIn interpreting treaties, \u201cwe begin with the\ntext of the treaty and the context in which the written words are\nused.\u201dSchlunk, 486 U.\u00a0S., at 699 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). For present purposes, the key word in Article 10(a)\nis \u201csend.\u201d This is a broad term,[1] and there is no apparent reason why it would exclude\nthe transmission of documents for a particular purpose (namely,\nservice). Moreover, the structure of the Hague Service Convention\nstrongly counsels against such a reading.The key structural point is that the scope of\nthe Convention is limited to service of documents. Several elements\nof the Convention indicate as much. First, the preamble states that\nthe Convention is intended \u201cto ensure that judicial and\nextrajudicial documentsto be served abroadshall be brought\nto the notice of the addressee in sufficient time.\u201d (Emphasis\nadded.) And Article 1 defines the Convention\u2019s scope by stating\nthat the Convention \u201cshall apply in all cases, in civil or\ncommercial matters, where there is occasion to transmit a judicial\nor extrajudicial documentfor service abroad.\u201d (Emphasis\nadded.) Even the Convention\u2019s full title reflects that the\nConvention concerns \u201cService Abroad.\u201dWe have also held as much.Schlunk, 486\nU.\u00a0S., at 701 (stating that the Convention \u201capplies only to\ndocuments transmitted for service abroad\u201d). As we explained, a\npreliminary draft of Article 1 was criticized \u201cbecause it suggested\nthat the Convention could apply to transmissions abroad that do not\nculminate in service.\u201dIbid.The final version of Article 1,\nhowever, \u201celiminates this possibility.\u201dIbid.The wording of\nArticle 1 makes clear that the Convention \u201capplies only when there\nis both transmission of a document from the requesting state to the\nreceiving state, and service upon the person for whom it is\nintended.\u201dIbid.In short, the text of the Convention reveals,\nand we have explicitly held, that the scope of the Convention is\nlimited to service of documents. In light of that, it would be\nquite strange if Article 10(a)\u2014apparently alone among the\nConvention\u2019s provisions\u2014concerned something other than service of\ndocuments.Indeed, under that reading, Article 10(a) would\nbe superfluous. The function of Article 10 is to ensure that,\nabsent objection from the receiving state, the Convention \u201cshall\nnot interfere\u201d with the activities described in 10(a), 10(b) and\n10(c). But Article 1 already \u201celiminates [the] possibility\u201d that\nthe Convention would apply to any communications that \u201cdo not\nculminate in service,\u201did.,at 701, so it is hard to imagine\nhow the Convention could interfere with any non-service\ncommunications. Accordingly, in order for Article 10(a) to do any\nwork, itmustpertain to sending documents for the purposes\nof service.Menon attempts to avoid this superfluity problem\nby suggesting that Article 10(a) does refer to serving\ndocuments\u2014but onlysomedocuments. Specifically, she makes a\ndistinction between two categories of service. According to Menon,\nArticle 10(a) does not apply toservice of process(which we\nhave defined as \u201ca formal delivery of documents that is legally\nsufficient to charge the defendant with notice of a pending\naction,\u201did.,at 700)). But Article 10(a) does apply, Menon\nsuggests, to the service of \u201cpost-answer judicial documents\u201d (that\nis, any additional documents which may have to be served later in\nthe litigation). Brief for Respondent 30\u201331. The problem with this\nargument is that it lacks any plausible textual footing in Article\n10.[2]If the drafters wished to limit Article 10(a) to\na particular subset of documents, they presumably would have said\nso\u2014as they did, for example, in Article 15, which refers to \u201ca writ\nof summons or an equivalent document.\u201d Instead, Article 10(a) uses\nthe term \u201cjudicial documents\u201d\u2014the same term that is featured in\n10(b) and 10(c). Accord-ingly, the notion that Article 10(a)\ngoverns a different set of documents than 10(b) or 10(c) is hard to\nfathom. And it certainly derives no support from the use of the\nword \u201csend,\u201d whose ordinary meaning is broad enough to cover the\ntransmission ofanyjudicial documents (including\nlitigation-initiating documents). Nothing about the word \u201csend\u201d\nsuggests that Article 10(a) isnarrowerthan 10(b) and\n10(c), let alone that Article 10(a) is somehow limited to\n\u201cpost-answer\u201d documents.Ultimately, Menon wishes to read the phrase\n\u201csend judicial documents\u201d as \u201cserve a subset of judicial\ndocuments.\u201d That is an entirely atextual reading, and Menon offers\nno sustained argument in support of it. Therefore, the only way to\nescape the conclusion that Article 10(a) includes service of\nprocess is to assert that it does not cover service of documents at\nall\u2014and, as shown above, that reading is structurally implausible\nand renders Article 10(a) superfluous.BThe text and structure of the Hague Service\nConvention, then, strongly suggest that Article 10(a) pertains to\nservice of documents. The only significant counterargument is that,\nunlike many other provisions in the Convention, Article 10(a) does\nnot include the word \u201cservice\u201d or any of its variants. The Article\n10(a) phrase \u201csend judicial documents,\u201d the argument goes, should\nmean something different than the phrase \u201ceffect service of\njudicial documents\u201d in the other two subparts of Article 10.This argument does not win the day for several\nreasons. First, it must contend with the compelling structural\nconsiderations discussed above. SeeAir Francev.Saks, 470 U.\u00a0S. 392, 397 (1985) (treaty interpretation\nmust take account of the \u201ccontext in which the written words are\nused\u201d); cf.University of Tex. Southwestern Medical Centerv.Nassar, 570 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 13)\n(\u201cJust as Congress\u2019 choice of words is presumed to be deliberate,\nso too are its structural choices\u201d).Second, the argument fails on its own terms.\nAssume for a second that the word \u201csend\u201d must mean something other\nthan \u201cserve.\u201d That would not imply that Article 10(a) mustexcludeservice. Instead, \u201csend[ing]\u201d could be a broader\nconcept that includes service but is not limited to it. That\nreading of the word \u201csend\u201d is probablymoreplausible than\ninterpreting it to exclude service, and it does not create the same\nsuperfluity problem.[3]Third, it must be remembered that the French\nversion of the Convention is \u201cequally authentic\u201d to the English\nversion.Schlunk, 486 U.\u00a0S., at 699. Menon does not\nseri-ously engage with the Convention\u2019s French text. But the word\n\u201cadresser\u201d\u2014the French counterpart to the word \u201csend\u201d in Article\n10(a)\u2014\u201chas been consistently interpreted as meaning service or\nnotice.\u201d Hague Conference on Private Int\u2019l Law, Practical Handbook\non the Operation of the Service Convention \u00b6279, p. 91 (4th ed.\n2016).In short, the most that could possibly be said\nfor this argument is that it creates an ambiguity as to Article\n10(a)\u2019s meaning. And when a treaty provision is ambiguous, the\nCourt \u201cmay look beyond the written words to the history of the\ntreaty, the negotiations, and the practical construction adopted by\nthe parties.\u201dSchlunk,supra, at 700 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). As discussed below, these traditional\ntools of treaty interpretation comfortably resolve any lingering\nambiguity in Water Splash\u2019s favor.IIIThree extratextual sources are especially\nhelpful in ascertaining Article 10(a)\u2019s meaning: the Convention\u2019s\ndrafting history, the views of the Executive, and the views of\nother signatories.Drafting history has often been used in treaty\ninterpretation. SeeMedell\u00ednv.Texas, 552 U.\u00a0S.\n491, 507 (2008) ;Saks,supra, at 400; see alsoSchlunk,supra, at 700 (analyzing the negotiating\nhistory of the Hague Service Convention). Here, the Convention\u2019s\ndrafting history strongly suggests that Article 10(a) allows\nservice through postal channels.Philip W. Amram was the member of the United\nStates delegation who was most closely involved in the drafting of\nthe Convention. See S. Exec. Rep. No. 6, 90th Cong., 1st Sess. 5\n(App.) (1967) (S. Exec. Rep.) (statement of State Department Deputy\nLegal Adviser Richard D. Kearney). A few months before the\nConvention was signed, he published an article describing and\nsummarizing it. In that article, he stated that \u201cArticle 10 permits\ndirect service by mail .\u00a0.\u00a0. unless [the receiving] state\nobjects to such service.\u201d The Proposed International Convention on\nthe Service of Documents Abroad, 51 A.\u00a0B.\u00a0A.\u00a0J. 650,\n653 (1965).[4]Along similar lines, the Rapporteur\u2019s report on\na draft version of Article 10\u2014which did not materially differ from\nthe final version\u2014stated that the \u201cprovision of paragraph 1 also\npermits service .\u00a0.\u00a0. by telegram\u201d and that the drafters\n\u201cdid not accept the proposal that postal channels be limited to\nregistered mail.\u201d 1 Ristau \u00a74\u20133\u20135(a), at 149. In other words, it\nwas clearly understood that service by postal channels was\npermissible, and the only question was whether it should be limited\nto registered mail.The Court also gives \u201cgreat weight\u201d to \u201cthe\nExecutive Branch\u2019s interpretation of a treaty.\u201dAbbottv.Abbott, 560 U.\u00a0S. 1, 15 (2010) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). In the half century since the Convention was\nadopted, the Executive has consistently maintained that the Hague\nService Convention allows service by mail.When President Johnson transmitted the\nConvention to the Senate for its advice and consent, he included a\nreport by Secretary of State Dean Rusk. That report stated that\n\u201cArticle 10 permits direct service by mail .\u00a0.\u00a0. unless\n[the receiving] state objects to such service.\u201d Convention on the\nService Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or\nCommercial Matters: Message From the President of the United\nStates, S. Exec. Doc. C, 90th Cong., 1st Sess., 5 (1967).In 1989, the Eighth Circuit issuedBankston,the first Federal Court of Appeals decision\nholding that the Hague Service Convention prohibits service by\nmail. 889 F.\u00a02d, at 174. The State Department expressed its\ndisagreement withBankstonin a letter addressed to the\nAdministrative Office of the U.\u00a0S. Courts and the National\nCenter for State Courts. See Notice of Other Documents (1), United\nStates Department of State Opinion Regarding theBankstonCase and Service by Mail to Japan Under the Hague Service\nConvention, 30 I.\u00a0L.\u00a0M. 260, 260\u2013261 (1991) (excerpts of\nMar. 14, 1990, letter). The letter stated that \u201cBankstonis\nincorrect to the extent that it suggests that the Hague Convention\ndoes not permit as a method of service of process the sending of a\ncopy of a summons and complaint by registered mail to a defendant\nin a foreign country.\u201dId.,at 261. The State Department\ntakes the same position on its website.[5]Finally, this Court has given \u201cconsiderable\nweight\u201d to the views of other parties to a treaty.Abbott,\n560 U.\u00a0S., at 16 (internal quotation marks omitted); seeLozanov.Montoya Alvarez, 572 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___\n(2014) (slip op., at 9) (noting the importance of \u201cread[ing] the\ntreaty in a manner consistent with thesharedexpectations\nof the contracting parties\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).\nAnd other signatories to the Convention have consistently adopted\nWater Splash\u2019s view.Multiple foreign courts have held that the Hague\nService Convention allows for service by mail.[6] In addition, several of the Convention\u2019s\nsignatories have either objected, or declined to object, to service\nby mail under Article 10, thereby acknowledging that Article 10\nencompasses service by mail.[7]\nFinally, several Special Commissions\u2014comprising numerous\ncontracting States\u2014have expressly stated that the Convention does\nnot prohibit service by mail.[8] By contrast, Menon identifies no evidence that any\nsignatory has ever rejected Water Splash\u2019s view.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*In short, the traditional tools of treaty\ninterpretation unmistakably demonstrate that Article 10(a)\nencompasses service by mail. To be clear, this does not mean that\nthe Convention affirmativelyauthorizesservice by mail.\nArticle 10(a) simply provides that, as long as the receiving state\ndoes not object, the Convention does not \u201cinterfere with\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. the freedom\u201d to serve documents through postal\nchannels. In other words, in cases governed by the Hague Service\nConvention, service by mail is permissible if two conditions are\nmet: first, the receiving state has not objected to service by\nmail; and second, service by mail is authorized under\notherwise-applicable law. SeeBrockmeyer, 383 F.\u00a03d, at\n803\u2013804.Because the Court of Appeals concluded that the\nConvention prohibited service by mail outright, it had no occasion\nto consider whether Texas law authorizes the methods of service\nused by Water Splash. We leave that question, and any other\nremaining issues, to be considered on remand to the extent they are\nproperly preserved.For these reasons, we vacate the judgment of the\nCourt of Appeals, and we remand the case for further proceedings\nnot inconsistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.Justice Gorsuch took no part in the\nconsideration or decision of this case.Notes1See Black\u2019s Law\nDictionary 1568 (10th ed. 2014) (defining \u201csend,\u201d in part, as \u201c[t]o\ncause to be moved or conveyed from a present location to another\nplace; esp., to deposit (a writing or notice) in the\nmail\u201d).2The argument also assumes\nthat the scope of the Convention is not limited to service of\nprocess (otherwise, Article 10(a) would be superfluous even under\nMenon\u2019s reading).Schlunkcan be read to suggest that this\nassumption is wrong. 486 U.\u00a0S., at 700\u2013701; see 1 B. Ristau,\nInternational Judicial Assistance \u00a74\u20131\u20134(2), p. 112 (1990 rev. ed.)\n(Ristau) (stating that the English term \u201cservice\u201d in the Convention\n\u201cmeans the formal delivery of a legal document to the addressee in\nsuch a manner as to legally charge him with notice of the\ninstitution of a legal proceeding\u201d). For the purposes of this\ndiscussion, we will assume,arguendo,that Menon\u2019s\nassumption is correct.3Another plausible\nexplanation for the distinct terminology of Article 10(a) is that\nit is the only provision in the Convention that specifically\ncontemplates direct service, without the use of an intermediary.\nSee Brief for United States asAmicus Curiae13 (\u201c[I]n\ncontrast to Article 10(a), all other methods of service identified\nin the Convention require the affirmative engagement of an\nintermediary to effect \u2018service\u2019\u00a0\u201d). The use of the word\n\u201csend\u201d may simply have been intended to reflect that\ndistinction.4Two years later, Amram\ntestified to the same effect before the Senate Foreign Relations\nCommittee. S. Exec. Rep., at 13 (stating that service by central\nauthority \u201cis not obligatory,\u201d and that other available techniques\nincluded \u201cdirect service by mail\u201d).5Dept. of State, Legal\nConsiderations: International Judicial Assistance: Service of\nProcess (stating that \u201c[s]ervice by registered .\u00a0.\u00a0. mail\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. is an option in many countries in the world,\u201d but\nthat it \u201cshould .\u00a0.\u00a0. not be used in the countries party\nto the Hague Service Conven-tion that objected to the method\ndescribed in Article 10(a) (postal channels)\u201d), online at\nhttps://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal-considerations/judicial/service-of-process.html\n(all Internet materials as last visited May 19, 2017).6See,e.g., Wangv.Lin, [2016] 132 O.
