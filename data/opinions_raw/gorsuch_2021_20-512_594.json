The plaintiffs before us brought\nthis lawsuit alleging that the National Collegiate Athletic\nAssociation (NCAA) and certain of its member institutions violated\nthis policy by agreeing to restrict the compensation colleges and\nuniversities may offer the student-athletes who play for their\nteams. After amassing a vast record and conducting an exhaustive\ntrial, the district court issued a 50-page opinion that cut both\nways. The court refused to disturb the NCAA\u2019s rules limiting\nundergraduate athletic scholarships and other compensation related\nto athletic performance. At the same time, the court struck down\nNCAA rules limiting the education-related benefits schools may\noffer student-athletes\u2014such as rules that prohibit schools from\noffering graduate or vocational school scholarships. Before us, the\nstudent-athletes do not challenge the district court\u2019s judgment.\nBut the NCAA does. In essence, it seeks immunity from the normal\noperation of the antitrust laws and argues, in any event, that the\ndistrict court should have approved all of its existing restraints.\nWe took this case to consider those objections.IAFrom the start, American colleges and\nuniversities have had a complicated relationship with sports and\nmoney. In 1852, students from Harvard and Yale participated in what\nmany regard as the Nation\u2019s first intercollegiate competition\u2014a\nboat race at Lake Winnipesaukee, New Hampshire. But this was no\npickup match. A railroad executive sponsored the event to promote\ntrain travel to the picturesque lake. T. Mendenhall, The\nHarvard-Yale Boat Race 1852\u20131924, pp. 15\u201316 (1993). He offered the\ncompetitors an all-expenses-paid vacation with lavish prizes\u2014along\nwith unlimited alcohol. See A. Zimbalist, Unpaid Professionals 6\u20137\n(1999) (Zimbalist); Rushin, Inside the Moat, Sports Illustrated,\nMar. 3, 1997. The event filled the resort with \u201clife and\nexcitement,\u201d N.\u00a0Y. Herald, Aug. 10, 1852, p. 2, col. 2, and\none student-athlete described the \u201c\u00a0\u2018junket\u2019\u00a0\u201d as an\nexperience \u201c\u00a0\u2018as unique and irreproducible as the Rhodian\ncolossus,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mendenhall, Harvard-Yale Boat Race, at 20.Life might be no \u201cless than a boat race,\u201d\nHolmes, On Receiving the Degree of Doctor of Laws, Yale University\nCommencement, June 30, 1886, in Speeches by Oliver Wendall Holmes,\np.\u00a027 (1918), but it was football that really caused college\nsports to take off. \u201cBy the late 1880s the traditional rivalry\nbetween Princeton and Yale was attracting 40,000 spectators and\ngenerating in excess of $25,000 .\u00a0.\u00a0. in gate revenues.\u201d\nZimbalist 7. Schools regularly had \u201cgraduate students and paid\nringers\u201d on their teams.Ibid.Colleges offered all manner of compensation to\ntalented athletes. Yale reportedly lured a tackle named James Hogan\nwith free meals and tuition, a trip to Cuba, the exclusive right to\nsell scorecards from his games\u2014and a job as a cigarette agent for\nthe American Tobacco Company.Ibid.; see also Needham, The\nCollege Athlete, McClure\u2019s Magazine, June 1905, p. 124. The absence\nof academic residency requirements gave rise to \u201c\u00a0\u2018tramp\nathletes\u2019\u00a0\u201d who \u201croamed the country making cameo athletic\nappearances, moving on whenever and wherever the money was better.\u201d\nF. Dealy, Win at Any Cost 71 (1990). One famous example was a law\nstudent at West Virginia University\u2014Fielding H. Yost\u2014\u201cwho, in 1896,\ntransferred to Lafayette as a freshman just in time to lead his new\nteammates to victory against its arch-rival, Penn.\u201dIbid.The next week, he \u201cwas back at West Virginia\u2019s law school.\u201dIbid.College sports became such a big business that Woodrow\nWilson, then President of Princeton University, quipped to alumni\nin 1890 that \u201c\u00a0\u2018Princeton is noted in this wide world for\nthree things: football, baseball, and collegiate\ninstruction.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Zimbalist 7.By 1905, though, a crisis emerged. While college\nfootball was hugely popular, it was extremely violent. Plays like\nthe flying wedge and the players\u2019 light protective gear led to 7\nfootball fatalities in 1893, 12 deaths the next year, and 18 in\n1905.Id., at 8. President Theodore Roosevelt responded by\nconvening a meeting between Harvard, Princeton, and Yale to review\nthe rules of the game, a gathering that ultimately led to the\ncreation of what we now know as the NCAA.Ibid.Organized\nprimarily as a standard-setting body, the association also\nexpressed a view at its founding about compensating college\nathletes\u2014admonishing that \u201c[n]o student shall represent a College\nor University in any intercollegiate game or contest who is paid or\nreceives, directly or indirectly, any money, or financial\nconcession.\u201d Intercollegiate Athletic Association of the United\nStates Constitution By-Laws, Art.\u00a0VII, \u00a73 (1906); see also\nProceedings of the Eleventh Annual Convention of the National\nCollegiate Athletic Association, Dec. 28, 1916, p.\u00a034.Reality did not always match aspiration. More\nthan two decades later, the Carnegie Foundation produced a report\non college athletics that found them still \u201csodden with the\ncommercial and the material and the vested interests that these\nforces have created.\u201d H. Savage, The Carnegie Foundation for the\nAdvancement of Teaching, American College Athletics Bull. 23, p.\n310 (1929). Schools across the country sought to leverage sports to\nbring in revenue, attract attention, boost enrollment, and raise\nmoney from alumni. The University of California\u2019s athletic revenue\nwas over $480,000, while Harvard\u2019s football revenue alone came in\nat $429,000.Id., at 87. College football was \u201cnot a\nstudent\u2019s game\u201d; it was an \u201corganized commercial enterprise\u201d\nfeaturing athletes with \u201cyears of training,\u201d \u201cprofessional\ncoaches,\u201d and competitions that were \u201chighly profitable.\u201dId., at viii.The commercialism extended to the market for\nstudent-athletes. Seeking the best players, many schools actively\nparticipated in a system \u201cunder which boys are offered pecuniary\nand other inducements to enter a particular college.\u201dId.,\nat xiv\u2013xv. One coach estimated that a rival team \u201cspent over\n$200,000 a year on players.\u201d Zimbalist 9. In 1939, freshmen at the\nUniversity of Pittsburgh went on strike because upperclassmen were\nreportedly earning more money. Crabb, The Amateurism Myth: A Case\nfor a New Tradition, 28 Stan. L. & Pol\u2019y Rev. 181, 190 (2017).\nIn the 1940s, Hugh McElhenny, a halfback at the University of\nWashington, \u201cbecame known as the first college player \u2018ever to take\na cut in salary to play pro football.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Zimbalist 22\u201323. He\nreportedly said: \u201c\u00a0\u2018[A] wealthy guy puts big bucks under my\npillow every time I score a touchdown. Hell, I can\u2019t afford to\ngraduate.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId.,at 211, n.\u00a017. In 1946, a\ncommentator offered this view: \u201c[W]hen it comes to chicanery,\ndouble-dealing, and general undercover work behind the scenes,\nbig-time college football is in a class by itself.\u201d Woodward, Is\nCollege Football on the Level?, Sport, Nov. 1946, Vol. 1, No. 3,\np.\u00a035.In 1948, the NCAA sought to do more than\nadmonish. It adopted the \u201cSanity Code.\u201d Colleges Adopt the \u2018Sanity\nCode\u2019 To Govern Sports, N.\u00a0Y. Times, Jan. 11, 1948, p.\u00a01,\ncol. 1.

But for\nthe first time the code also authorized colleges and universities\nto pay athletes\u2019 tuition.Ibid. And it created a new\nenforcement mechanism\u2014providing for the \u201csuspension or expulsion\u201d\nof \u201cproven offenders.\u201d Colleges Adopt \u2018Sanity Code,\u2019 N.\u00a0Y.\nTimes, p.\u00a01, col. 1. To some, these changes sought to\nsubstitute a consistent, above-board compensation system for the\nvarying under-the-table schemes that had long proliferated. To\nothers, the code marked \u201cthe beginning of the NCAA behaving as an\neffective cartel,\u201d by enabling its member schools to set and\nenforce \u201crules that limit the price they have to pay for their\ninputs (mainly the \u2018student-athletes\u2019).\u201d Zimbalist 10.The rules regarding student-athlete compensation\nhave evolved ever since. In 1956, the NCAA expanded the scope of\nallowable payments to include room, board, books, fees, and \u201ccash\nfor incidental expenses such as laundry.\u201dIn\u00a0re National\nCollegiate Athletic Assn. Athletic Grant-in-Aid Cap Antitrust\nLitig., 375 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d 1058, 1063 (ND Cal. 2019)\n(hereinafter D. Ct. Op.). In 1974, the NCAA began permitting paid\nprofessionals in one sport to compete on an amateur basis in\nanother. Brief for Historians asAmici Curiae10. In 2014,\nthe NCAA \u201cannounced it would allow athletic conferences to\nauthorize their member schools to increase scholarships up to the\nfull cost of attendance.\u201dO\u2019Bannonv.National Collegiate\nAthletic Assn., 802 F.3d 1049, 1054\u20131055 (CA9 2015). The 80\nmember schools of the \u201cPower Five\u201d athletic conferences\u2014the\nconferences with the highest revenue in Division I\u2014promptly voted\nto raise their scholarship limits to an amount that is generally\nseveral thousand dollars higher than previous limits. D. Ct. Op.,\nat 1064.In recent years, changes have continued. The\nNCAA has created the \u201cStudent Assistance Fund\u201d and the \u201cAcademic\nEnhancement Fund\u201d to \u201cassist student-athletes in meeting financial\nneeds,\u201d \u201cimprove their welfare or academic support,\u201d or \u201crecognize\nacademic achievement.\u201dId., at 1072. These funds have\nsupplied money to student-athletes for \u201cpostgraduate scholarships\u201d\nand \u201cschool supplies,\u201d as well as \u201cbenefits that are not related to\neducation,\u201d such as \u201closs-of-value insurance premiums,\u201d \u201ctravel\nexpenses,\u201d \u201cclothing,\u201d and \u201cmagazine subscriptions.\u201dId., at\n1072, n.\u00a015. In 2018, the NCAA made more than $84 million\navailable through the Student Activities Fund and more than $48\nmillion available through the Academic Enhancement Fund.Id., at 1072. Assistance may be provided in cash or in kind,\nand there is no limit to the amount any particular student-athlete\nmay receive.Id., at 1073. Since 2015, disbursements to\nindividual students have sometimes been tens of thousands of\ndollars above the full cost of attendance.Ibid.The NCAA has also allowed payments\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018incidental to athletics participation,\u2019\u00a0\u201d including\nawards for \u201cparticipation or achievement in athletics\u201d (like\n\u201cqualifying for a bowl game\u201d) and certain \u201cpayments from outside\nentities\u201d (such as for \u201cperformance in the Olympics\u201d).Id.,at 1064, 1071, 1074. The NCAA permits its member schools to award\nup to (but no more than) two annual \u201cSenior Scholar Awards\u201d of\n$10,000 for students to attend graduate school after their athletic\neligibility expires.Id., at 1074. Finally, the NCAA allows\nschools to fund travel for student-athletes\u2019 family members to\nattend \u201ccertain events.\u201dId., at 1069.Over the decades, the NCAA has become a\nsprawling enterprise. Its membership comprises about 1,100 colleges\nand universities, organized into three divisions.Id., at\n1063. Division I teams are often the most popular and attract the\nmost money and the most talented athletes. Currently, Division I\nincludes roughly 350 schools divided across 32 conferences. Seeibid.Within Division I, the most popular sports are\nbasketball and football. The NCAA divides Division I football into\nthe Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) and the Football Championship\nSubdivision, with the FBS generally featuring the best teams.Ibid.The 32 conferences in Division I function similarly to\nthe NCAA itself, but on a smaller scale. They \u201ccan and do enact\ntheir own rules.\u201dId.,at 1090.At the center of this thicket of associations\nand rules sits a massive business. The NCAA\u2019s current broadcast\ncontract for the March Madness basketball tournament is worth $1.1\nbillion annually. Seeid.,at 1077, n.\u00a020. Its\ntelevision deal for the FBS conference\u2019s College Football Playoff\nis worth approximately $470 million per year. Seeid., at\n1063; Bachman, ESPN Strikes Deal for College Football Playoff, Wall\nStreet Journal, Nov. 21, 2012. Beyond these sums, the Division I\nconferences earn substantial revenue from regular-season games. For\nexample, the Southeastern Conference (SEC) \u201cmade more than $409\nmillion in revenues from television contracts alone in 2017, with\nits total conference revenues exceeding $650 million that year.\u201d D.\nCt. Op., at 1063. All these amounts have \u201cincreased consistently\nover the years.\u201dIbid.Those who run this enterprise profit in a\ndifferent way than the student-athletes whose activities they\noversee. The president of the NCAA earns nearly $4 million per\nyear. Brief for Players Association of the National Football League\net al. asAmici Curiae17. Commissioners of the top\nconferences take home between $2 to $5 million.Ibid.College athletic directors average more than $1 million annually.Ibid.And annual salaries for top Division I college\nfootball coaches approach $11 million, with some of their\nassistants making more than $2.5 million.Id., at 17\u201318.BThe plaintiffs are current and former\nstudent-athletes in men\u2019s Division I FBS football and men\u2019s and\nwomen\u2019s Division I basketball. They filed a class action against\nthe NCAA and 11 Division I conferences (for simplicity\u2019s sake, we\nrefer to the defendants collectively as the NCAA). The\nstudent-athletes challenged the \u201ccurrent, interconnected set of\nNCAA rules that limit the compensation they may receive in exchange\nfor their athletic services.\u201d D. Ct. Op., at 1062, 1065, n.\u00a05.\nSpecifically, they alleged that the NCAA\u2019s rules violate \u00a71 of the\nSherman Act, which prohibits \u201ccontract[s], combination[s], or\nconspirac[ies] in restraint of trade or commerce.\u201d 15\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71.After pretrial proceedings stretching years, the\ndistrict court conducted a 10-day bench trial. It heard experts and\nlay witnesses from both sides, and received volumes of evidence and\nbriefing, all before issuing an exhaustive decision. In the end,\nthe court found the evidence undisputed on certain points. The NCAA\ndid not \u201ccontest evidence showing\u201d that it and its members have\nagreed to compensation limits on student-athletes; the NCAA and its\nconferences enforce these limits by punishing violations; and these\nlimits \u201caffect interstate commerce.\u201d D. Ct. Op., at 1066.Based on these premises, the district court\nproceeded to assess the lawfulness of the NCAA\u2019s challenged\nrestraints. This Court has \u201clong recognized that in view of the\ncommon law and the law in this country when the Sherman Act was\npassed, the phrase \u2018restraint of trade\u2019 is best read to mean \u2018undue\nrestraint.\u2019\u00a0\u201dOhiov.American Express Co., 585\nU.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2018) (slip op., at 8) (brackets and some\ninternal quotation marks omitted). Determining whether a restraint\nis undue for purposes of the Sherman Act \u201cpresumptively\u201d calls for\nwhat we have described as a \u201crule of reason analysis.\u201dTexaco\nInc.v.Dagher,547 U.S.\n1, 5 (2006);Standard Oil Co. of N.\u00a0J.v.United\nStates,221 U.S.\n1, 60\u201362 (1911). That manner of analysis generally requires a\ncourt to \u201cconduct a fact-specific assessment of market power and\nmarket structure\u201d to assess a challenged restraint\u2019s \u201cactual effect\non competition.\u201dAmerican Express, 585 U.\u00a0S., at\n___\u2013___ (slip op., at 8\u20139) (internal quotation marks omitted).\nAlways, \u201c[t]he goal is to distinguish between restraints with\nanticompetitive effect that are harmful to the consumer and\nrestraints stimulating competition that are in the consumer\u2019s best\ninterest.\u201dIbid.(brackets and internal quotation marks\nomitted).In applying the rule of reason, the district\ncourt began by observing that the NCAA enjoys \u201cnear complete\ndominance of, and exercise[s] monopsony power in, the relevant\nmarket\u201d\u2014which it defined as the market for \u201cathletic services in\nmen\u2019s and women\u2019s Division I basketball and FBS football, wherein\neach class member participates in his or her sport-specific\nmarket.\u201d D. Ct. Op., at 1097. The \u201cmost talented athletes are\nconcentrated\u201d in the \u201cmarkets for Division I basketball and FBS\nfootball.\u201dId., at 1067. There are no \u201cviable substitutes,\u201d\nas the \u201cNCAA\u2019s Division I essentiallyisthe relevant market\nfor elite college football and basketball.\u201dId., at 1067,\n1070. In short, the NCAA and its member schools have the \u201cpower to\nrestrain student-athlete compensation in any way and at any time\nthey wish, without any meaningful risk of diminishing their market\ndominance.\u201dId., at 1070.The district court then proceeded to find that\nthe NCAA\u2019s compensation limits \u201cproduce significant anticompetitive\neffects in the relevant market.\u201dId., at 1067. Though member\nschools compete fiercely in recruiting student-athletes, the NCAA\nuses its monopsony power to \u201ccap artificially the compensation\noffered to recruits.\u201dId., at 1097. In a market without the\nchallenged restraints, the district court found, \u201ccompetition among\nschools would increase in terms of the compensation they would\noffer to recruits, and student- athlete compensation would be\nhigher as a result.\u201dId., at 1068. \u201cStudent-athletes would\nreceive offers that would more closely match the value of their\nathletic services.\u201dIbid.And notably, the court observed,\nthe NCAA \u201cdid not meaningfully dispute\u201d any of this evidence.Id., at 1067; see also Tr. of Oral Arg. 31 (\u201c[T]here\u2019s no\ndispute that the\u2014the no-pay-for-play rule imposes a significant\nrestraint on a relevant antitrust market\u201d).The district court next considered the NCAA\u2019s\nprocompetitive justifications for its restraints. The NCAA\nsuggested that its restrictions help increase output in college\nsports and maintain a competitive balance among teams. But the\ndistrict court rejected those justifications, D. Ct. Op., at 1070,\nn.\u00a012, and the NCAA does not pursue them here. The NCAA\u2019s only\nremaining defense was that its rules preserve amateurism, which in\nturn widens consumer choice by providing a unique product\u2014amateur\ncollege sports as distinct from professional sports. Admittedly,\nthis asserted benefit accrues to consumers in the NCAA\u2019s\nseller-side consumer market rather than to student-athletes whose\ncompensation the NCAA fixes in its buyer-side labor market. But,\nthe NCAA argued, the district court needed to assess its restraints\nin the labor market in light of their procompetitive benefits in\nthe consumer market\u2014and the district court agreed to do so.Id., at 1098.Turning to that task, the court observed that\nthe NCAA\u2019s conception of amateurism has changed steadily over the\nyears. Seeid., at 1063\u20131064, 1072\u20131073; see alsosupra,at 3\u20137. The court noted that the NCAA \u201cnowhere\ndefine[s] the nature of the amateurism they claim consumers insist\nupon.\u201d D. Ct. Op., at 1070. And, given all this, the court\nstruggled to ascertain for itself \u201cany coherent definition\u201d of the\nterm,id., at 1074, noting the testimony of a former SEC\ncommissioner that he\u2019s \u201c\u00a0\u2018never been clear\non\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. what is really meant by amateurism.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId., at 1070\u20131071.Nor did the district court find much evidence to\nsupport the NCAA\u2019s contention that its compensation restrictions\nplay a role in consumer demand. As the court put it, the evidence\nfailed \u201cto establish that the challenged compensation rules, in and\nof themselves, have any direct connection to consumer demand.\u201dId., at 1070. The court observed, for example, that the\nNCAA\u2019s \u201conly economics expert on the issue of consumer demand\u201d did\nnot \u201cstudy any standard measures of consumer demand\u201d but instead\nsimply \u201cinterviewed people connected with the NCAA and its schools,\nwho were chosen for him by defense counsel.\u201dId., at 1075.\nMeanwhile, the student-athletes presented expert testimony and\nother evidence showing that consumer demand has increased markedly\ndespite the new types of compensation the NCAA has allowed in\nrecent decades.Id., at 1074, 1076. The plaintiffs presented\neconomic and other evidence suggesting as well that further\nincreases in student-athlete compensation would \u201cnot negatively\naffect consumer demand.\u201dId., at 1076. At the same time,\nhowever, the district court did find that one particular aspect of\nthe NCAA\u2019s compensation limits \u201cmay have some effect in preserving\nconsumer demand.\u201dId.,at 1082. Specifically, the court\nfound that rules aimed at ensuring \u201cstudent-athletes do not receive\nunlimited payments unrelated to education\u201d could play some role in\nproduct differentiation with professional sports and thus help\nsustain consumer demand for college athletics.Id., at\n1083.The court next required the student-athletes to\nshow that \u201csubstantially less restrictive alternative rules\u201d\nexisted that \u201cwould achieve the same procompetitive effect as the\nchallenged set of rules.\u201dId., at 1104. The district court\nemphasized that the NCAA must have \u201cample latitude\u201d to run its\nenterprise and that courts \u201cmay not use antitrust laws to make\nmarginal adjustments to broadly reasonable market restraints.\u201dIbid.(internal quotation marks omitted). In light of these\nstandards, the court found the student-athletes had met their\nburden in some respects but not others. The court rejected the\nstudent-athletes\u2019 challenge to NCAA rules that limit athletic\nscholarships to the full cost of attendance and that restrict\ncompensation and benefits unrelated to education. These may be\nprice-fixing agreements, but the court found them to be reasonable\nin light of the possibility that \u201cprofessional-level cash payments\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. could blur the distinction between college sports\nand professional sports and thereby negatively affect consumer\ndemand.\u201dIbid.The court reached a different conclusion for\ncaps on education-related benefits\u2014such as rules that limit\nscholarships for graduate or vocational school, payments for\nacademic tutoring, or paid posteligibility internships.Id.,\nat 1088. On no account, the court found, could such\neducation-related benefits be \u201cconfused with a professional\nathlete\u2019s salary.\u201dId., at 1083. If anything, they\n\u201cemphasize that the recipients are students.\u201dIbid.Enjoining the NCAA\u2019s restrictions on these forms of compensation\nalone, the court concluded, would be substantially less restrictive\nthan the NCAA\u2019s current rules and yet fully capable of preserving\nconsumer demand for college sports.Id., at 1088.The court then entered an injunction reflecting\nits findings and conclusions. Nothing in the order precluded the\nNCAA from continuing to fix compensation and benefits unrelated to\neducation; limits on athletic scholarships, for example, remained\nuntouched. The court enjoined the NCAA only from limiting\neducation-related compensation or benefits that conferences and\nschools may provide to student-athletes playing Division I football\nand basketball. App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 20\u2013512, p. 167a, \u00b61.\nThe court\u2019s injunction further specified that the NCAA could\ncontinue to limit cash awards for academic achievement\u2014but only so\nlong as those limits are no lower than the cash awards allowed for\nathletic achievement (currently $5,980 annually).Id.,at\n168a\u2013169a, \u00b65; Order Granting Motion for Clarification of\nInjunction in No. 4:14\u2013md\u201302541, ECF Doc. 1329, pp. 5\u20136 (ND Cal.,\nDec. 30, 2020). The court added that the NCAA and its members were\nfree to propose a definition of compensation or benefits\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018related to education.\u2019\u00a0\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. in No.\n20\u2013512, at 168a, \u00b64. And the court explained that the NCAA was free\nto regulate how conferences and schools provide education-related\ncompensation and benefits.Ibid.The court further\nemphasized that its injunction applied only to the NCAA and\nmulti-conference agreements\u2014thus allowing individual conferences\n(and the schools that constitute them) to impose tighter\nrestrictions if they wish.Id., at 169a, \u00b66. The district\ncourt\u2019s injunction issued in March 2019, and took effect in August\n2020.Both sides appealed. The student-athletes said\nthe district court did not go far enough; it should have enjoined\nall of the NCAA\u2019s challenged compensation limits, including those\n\u201cuntethered to education,\u201d like its restrictions on the size of\nathletic scholarships and cash awards.In\u00a0re National\nCollegiate Athletic Assn. Athletic Grant-in-Aid Cap Antitrust\nLitig., 958 F.3d 1239, 1263 (CA9 2020). The NCAA, meanwhile,\nargued that the district court went too far by weakening its\nrestraints on education-related compensation and benefits. In the\nend, the court of appeals affirmed in full, explaining its view\nthat \u201cthe district court struck the right balance in crafting a\nremedy that both prevents anticompetitive harm to Student-Athletes\nwhile serving the procompetitive purpose of preserving the\npopularity of college sports.\u201dIbid.CUnsatisfied with this result, the NCAA asks us\nto reverse to the extent the lower courts sided with the student-\nathletes. For their part, the student-athletes do not renew their\nacross-the-board challenge to the NCAA\u2019s compensation restrictions.\nAccordingly, we do not pass on the rules that remain in place or\nthe district court\u2019s judgment upholding them. Our review is\nconfined to those restrictions now enjoined.Before us, as through much of the litigation\nbelow, some of the issues most frequently debated in antitrust\nlitigation are uncontested. The parties do not challenge the\ndistrict court\u2019s definition of the relevant market. They do not\ncontest that the NCAA enjoys monopoly (or, as it\u2019s called on the\nbuyer side, monopsony) control in that labor market\u2014such that it is\ncapable of depressing wages below competitive levels and\nrestricting the quantity of student-athlete labor. Nor does the\nNCAA dispute that its member schools compete fiercely for\nstudent-athletes but remain subject to NCAA-issued-and-enforced\nlimits on what compensation they can offer. Put simply, this suit\ninvolves admitted horizontal price fixing in a market where the\ndefendants exercise monopoly control.Other significant matters are taken as given\nhere too. No one disputes that the NCAA\u2019s restrictionsin\nfactdecrease the compensation that student-athletes receive\ncompared to what a competitive market would yield. No one questions\neither that decreases in compensation also depress participation by\nstudent-athletes in the relevant labor market\u2014so that price and\nquantity are both suppressed. See 12 P. Areeda & H. Hovenkamp,\nAntitrust Law \u00b62011b, p. 134 (4th ed. 2019) (Areeda &\nHovenkamp). Nor does the NCAA suggest that, to prevail, the\nplaintiff student-athletes must show that its restraints harm\ncompetition in the seller-side (or consumer facing) market as well\nas in its buyer-side (or labor) market. See,e.g.,Mandeville Island Farms, Inc.v.American Crystal Sugar\nCo.,334 U.S.\n219, 235 (1948);Weyerhaeuser Co.v.Ross-Simmons\nHardwood Lumber Co.,549 U.S.\n312, 321 (2007); 2A Areeda & Hovenkamp \u00b6352c, pp. 288\u2013289\n(2014); 12id., \u00b62011a, at 132\u2013134.Meanwhile, the student-athletes do not question\nthat the NCAA may permissibly seek to justify its restraints in the\nlabor market by pointing to procompetitive effects they produce in\nthe consumer market. Someamiciargue that \u201ccompetition in\ninput markets is incommensurable with competition in output\nmarkets,\u201d and that a court should not \u201ctrade off\u00a0\u201d sacrificing\na legally cognizable interest in competition in one market to\nbetter promote competition in a different one; review should\ninstead be limited to the particular market in which antitrust\nplaintiffs have asserted their injury. Brief for American Antitrust\nInstitute asAmicus Curiae3, 11\u201312. But the parties before\nus do not pursue this line.IIAWith all these matters taken as given, we\nexpress no views on them. Instead, we focus only on the objections\nthe NCAAdoesraise. Principally, it suggests that the lower\ncourts erred by subjecting its compensation restrictions to a rule\nof reason analysis. In the NCAA\u2019s view, the courts should have\ngiven its restrictions at most an \u201cabbreviated deferential review,\u201d\nBrief for Petitioner in No. 20\u2013512, p.\u00a014, or a \u201c\u00a0\u2018quick\nlook,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Brief for Petitioners in No. 20\u2013520, p.\u00a018,\nbefore approving them.The NCAA offers a few reasons why. Perhaps\ndominantly, it argues that it is a joint venture and that\ncollaboration among its members is necessary if they are to offer\nconsumers the benefit of intercollegiate athletic competition. We\ndoubt little of this. There\u2019s no question, for example, that many\n\u201cjoint ventures are calculated to enable firms to do something more\ncheaply or better than they did it before.\u201d 13 Areeda &\nHovenkamp \u00b62100c, at 7. And the fact that joint ventures can have\nsuch procompetitive benefits surely stands as a caution against\ncondemning their arrangements too reflexively. SeeDagher,\n547 U.\u00a0S., at 7;Broadcast Music, Inc.v.Columbia\nBroadcasting System, Inc.,441 U.S.\n1, 22\u201323 (1979).But even assuming (without deciding) that the\nNCAA is a joint venture, that does not guarantee the foreshortened\nreview it seeks. Most restraints challenged under the Sherman\nAct\u2014including most joint venture restrictions\u2014are subject to the\nrule of reason, which (again) we have described as \u201ca fact-specific\nassessment of market power and market structure\u201d aimed at assessing\nthe challenged restraint\u2019s \u201cactual effect on\ncompetition\u201d\u2014especially its capacity to reduce output and increase\nprice.American Express, 585 U.\u00a0S., at ___\u2013___ (slip\nop., at 8\u20139) (internal quotation marks omitted).Admittedly, the amount of work needed to conduct\na fair assessment of these questions can vary. As the NCAA\nobserves, this Court has suggested that sometimes we can determine\nthe competitive effects of a challenged restraint in the\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018twinkling of an eye.\u2019\u00a0\u201dBoard of Regents, 468\nU.\u00a0S., at 110, n.\u00a039 (quoting P. Areeda, The \u201cRule of\nReason\u201d in Antitrust Analysis: General Issues 37\u201338 (Federal\nJudicial Center, June 1981));American Needle, Inc.v.National Football League,560 U.S.\n183, 203 (2010). That is true, though, only for restraints at\nopposite ends of the competitive spectrum. For those sorts of\nrestraints\u2014rather than restraints in the great in-between\u2014a quick\nlook is sufficient for approval or condemnation.At one end of the spectrum, some restraints may\nbe so obviously incapable of harming competition that they require\nlittle scrutiny. InRothery Storage & Van Co.v.Atlas Van Lines, Inc., 792 F.2d 210 (CADC 1986), for\nexample, Judge Bork explained that the analysis could begin and end\nwith the observation that the joint venture under review\n\u201ccommand[ed] between 5.1 and 6% of the relevant market.\u201dId., at 217. Usually, joint ventures enjoying such small\nmarket share are incapable of impairing competition. Should they\nreduce their output, \u201cthere would be no effect upon market price\nbecause firms making up the other 94% of the market would simply\ntake over the abandoned business.\u201dIbid.; see also 7 Areeda\n& Hovenkamp \u00b61507a, p. 444 (2017) (If \u201cthe exercise of market\npower is not plausible, the challenged practice is legal\u201d);Polk\nBros., Inc.v.Forest City Enterprises, Inc., 776\nF.2d 185, 191 (CA7 1985) (\u201cUnless the firms have the power to raise\nprice by curtailing output, their agreement is unlikely to harm\nconsumers, and it makes sense to understand their cooperation as\nbenign or beneficial\u201d).At the other end, some agreements among\ncompetitors so obviously threaten to reduce output and raise prices\nthat they might be condemned as unlawfulper\u00a0seor\nrejected after only a quick look. SeeDagher, 547\nU.\u00a0S., at 7, n.\u00a03;California Dental Assn.v.FTC,526 U.S.\n756, 770 (1999). Recognizing the inherent limits on a court\u2019s\nability to master an entire industry\u2014and aware that there are often\nhard-to-see efficiencies attendant to complex business\narrangements\u2014we take special care not to deploy these condemnatory\ntools until we have amassed \u201cconsiderable experience with the type\nof restraint at issue\u201d and \u201ccan predict with confidence that it\nwould be invalidated in all or almost all instances.\u201dLeegin\nCreative Leather Products, Inc.v.PSKS, Inc.,551 U.S.\n877, 886\u2013887 (2007); Easterbrook, On Identifying Exclusionary\nConduct, 61 Notre Dame L.\u00a0Rev. 972, 975 (1986) (noting that it\ncan take \u201ceconomists years, sometimes decades, to understand why\ncertain business practices work [and] determine whether they work\nbecause of increased efficiency or exclusion\u201d); see alsoinfra, at 26\u201327 (further reasons for caution).None of this helps the NCAA. The NCAAacceptsthat its members collectively enjoy monopsony power\nin the market for student-athlete services, such that its\nrestraints can (and in fact do) harm competition. See D. Ct. Op.,\nat 1067. Unlike customers who would look elsewhere when a small van\ncompany raises its prices above market levels, the district court\nfound (and the NCAA does not here contest) that student-athletes\nhave nowhere else to sell their labor. Even if the NCAA is a joint\nventure, then, it is hardly of the sort that would warrant\nquick-look approval for all its myriad rules and restrictions.Nor does the NCAA\u2019s status as a particular type\nof venture categorically exempt its restraints from ordinary rule\nof reason review. We do not doubt that some degree of coordination\nbetween competitors within sports leagues can be procompetitive.\nWithout some agreement among rivals\u2014on things like how many players\nmay be on the field or the time allotted for play\u2014the very\ncompetitions that consumers value would not be possible. SeeBoard of Regents, 468 U.\u00a0S., at 101 (quoting R. Bork,\nThe Antitrust Paradox 278 (1978)). Accordingly, even a sports\nleague with market power might see some agreements among its\nmembers win antitrust approval in the \u201c\u00a0\u2018twinkling of an\neye.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAmerican Needle, 560 U.\u00a0S., at 203.But this insight does not always apply. Thatsomerestraints are necessary to create or maintain a league\nsport does not meanall\u201caspects of elaborate interleague\ncooperation are.\u201dId., at 199, n.\u00a07. While a quick look\nwill often be enough to approve the restraints \u201cnecessary to\nproduce a game,\u201dibid., a fuller review may be appropriate\nfor others. See,e.g.,Chicago Professional Sports Ltd.\nPartnershipv.National Basketball Assn.,95 F.3d 593, 600 (CA7 1996) (\u201cJust as the ability of McDonald\u2019s\nfranchises to coordinate the release of a new hamburger does not\nimply their ability to agree on wages for counter workers, so the\nability of sports teams to agree on a TV contract need not imply an\nability to set wages for players\u201d).The NCAA\u2019s rules fixing wages for\nstudent-athletes fall on the far side of this line. Nobody\nquestions that Division I basketball and FBS football can proceed\n(and have proceeded) without the education-related compensation\nrestrictions the district court enjoined; the games go on. Instead,\nthe parties dispute whether and to what extent those restrictions\nin the NCAA\u2019s labor market yield benefits in its consumer market\nthat can be attained using substantially less restrictive means.\nThat dispute presents complex questions requiring more than a blink\nto answer.BEven if background antitrust principles\ncounsel in favor of the rule of reason, the NCAA replies that a\nparticular precedent ties our hands. The NCAA directs our attention\ntoBoard of Regents, where this Court considered the\nleague\u2019s rules restricting the ability of its member schools to\ntelevise football games. 468 U.\u00a0S., at 94. On the NCAA\u2019s\nreading, that decision expressly approved its limits on\nstudent-athlete compensation\u2014and this approval forecloses any\nmeaningful review of those limits today.We see things differently.Board of\nRegentsexplained that the league\u2019s television rules amounted\nto \u201c[h]orizontal price fixing and output limitation[s]\u201d of the sort\nthat are \u201cordinarily condemned\u201d as \u201c\u00a0\u2018illegalper\u00a0se.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId., at 100. The Court declined\nto declare the NCAA\u2019s restraintsper\u00a0seunlawful only\nbecause they arose in \u201can industry\u201d in which some \u201chorizontal\nrestraints on competition are essential if the product is to be\navailable at all.\u201dId., at 101\u2013102. Our analysis today is\nfully consistent with all of this. Indeed, if any daylight exists\nit is only in the NCAA\u2019s favor. WhileBoard of Regentsdid\nnot condemn the NCAA\u2019s broadcasting restraints asper\u00a0seunlawful, it invoked abbreviated antitrust\nreview as a path to condemnation, not salvation.Id., at\n109, n.\u00a039. If a quick look was thought sufficient before\nrejecting the NCAA\u2019s procompetitive rationales in that case, it is\nhard to see how the NCAA might object to a court providing a more\ncautious form of review before reaching a similar judgment\nhere.To be sure, the NCAA isn\u2019t without a reply. It\nnotes that, in the course of reaching its judgment about television\nmarketing restrictions, theBoard of RegentsCourt commented\non student-athlete compensation restrictions. Most particularly,\nthe NCAA highlights this passage:\u201cThe NCAA plays a critical role in the\nmaintenance of a revered tradition of amateurism in college sports.\nThere can be no question but that it needs ample latitude to play\nthat role, or that the preservation of the student-athlete in\nhigher education adds richness and diversity to intercollegiate\nathletics and is entirely consistent with the goals of the Sherman\nAct.\u201dId., at 120.See alsoid., at 101, 102 (the NCAA\n\u201cseeks to market a particular brand of football\u201d in which \u201cathletes\nmust not be paid, must be required to attend class, and the like\u201d).\nOn the NCAA\u2019s telling, these observations foreclose any rule of\nreason review in this suit.Once more, we cannot agree.Board of\nRegentsmay suggest that courts should take care when assessing\nthe NCAA\u2019s restraints on student-athlete compensation, sensitive to\ntheir procompetitive possibilities. But these remarks do not\nsuggest that courts must reflexively rejectallchallenges\nto the NCAA\u2019s compensation restrictions. Student-athlete\ncompensation rules were not even at issue inBoard of\nRegents. And the Court made clear it was only assuming the\nreasonableness of the NCAA\u2019s restrictions: \u201cIt is reasonable toassumethat most of the regulatory controls of the NCAA are\njustifiable means of fostering competition among amateur athletic\nteams and are therefore procompetitive .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201dId., at 117 (emphasis added). Accordingly, the Court simply\ndid not have occasion to declare\u2014nor did it declare\u2014the NCAA\u2019s\ncompensation restrictions procompetitive both in 1984 and\nforevermore.Our confidence on this score is fortified by\nstill another factor. Whether an antitrust violation exists\nnecessarily depends on a careful analysis of market realities. See,e.g.,American Express Co., 585 U.\u00a0S., at\n___\u2013___ (slip op., at 10\u201312); 2B Areeda & Hovenkamp \u00b6500,\np.\u00a0107 (2014). If those market realities change, so may the\nlegal analysis.When it comes to college sports, there can be\nlittle doubt that the market realities have changed significantly\nsince 1984. Since then, the NCAA has dramatically increased the\namounts and kinds of benefits schools may provide to\nstudent-athletes. For example, it has allowed the conferences\nflexibility to set new and higher limits on athletic scholarships.\nD. Ct. Op., at 1064. It has increased the size of permissible\nbenefits \u201cincidental to athletics participation.\u201dId., at\n1066. And it has developed the Student Assistance Fund and the\nAcademic Enhancement Fund, which in 2018 alone provided over $100\nmillion to student-athletes.Id., at 1072. Nor is that all\nthat has changed. In 1985, Division I football and basketball\nraised approximately $922 million and $41 million respectively.\nBrief for Former NCAA Executives asAmici Curiae7. By 2016,\nNCAA Division I schools raised more than $13.5 billion.Ibid.From 1982 to 1984, CBS paid $16 million per year to\ntelevise the March Madness Division I men\u2019s basketball tournament.Ibid.In 2016, those annual television rights brought in\ncloser to $1.1 billion. D. Ct. Op., at 1077, n.\u00a020.Given the sensitivity of antitrust analysis to\nmarket realities\u2014and how much has changed in this market\u2014we think\nit would be particularly unwise to treat an aside inBoard of\nRegentsas more than that. This Court may be \u201cinfallible only\nbecause we are final,\u201dBrownv.Allen,344 U.S.\n443, 540 (1953) (Jackson, J., concurring in result), but those\nsorts of stray comments are neither.CThe NCAA submits that a rule of reason\nanalysis is inappropriate for still another reason\u2014because the NCAA\nand its member schools are not \u201ccommercial enterprises\u201d and instead\noversee intercollegiate athletics \u201cas an integral part of the\nundergraduate experience.\u201d Brief for Petitioner in No. 20\u2013512, at\n31. The NCAA represents that it seeks to \u201cmaintain amateurism in\ncollege sports as part of serving [the] societally important\nnon-commercial objective\u201d of \u201chigher education.\u201dId., at\n3.Here again, however, there may be less of a\ndispute than meets the eye. The NCAA does not contest that its\nrestraints affect interstate trade and commerce and are thus\nsubject to the Sherman Act. See D. Ct. Op., at 1066. The NCAA\nacknowledges that this Court already analyzed (and struck down)\nsome of its restraints as anticompetitive inBoard of\nRegents. And it admits, as it must, that the Court did all this\nonly after observing that the Sherman Act had already been applied\nto other nonprofit organizations\u2014and that \u201cthe economic\nsignificance of the NCAA\u2019s nonprofit character is questionable at\nbest\u201d given that \u201cthe NCAA and its member institutions are in fact\norganized to maximize revenues.\u201d 468 U.\u00a0S., at 100\u2013101,\nn.\u00a022. Nor, on the other side of the equation, does anyone\ncontest that the status of the NCAA\u2019s members as schools and the\nstatus of student-athletes as students may be relevant in assessing\nconsumer demand as part of a rule of reason review.With this much agreed it is unclear exactly what\nthe NCAA seeks. To the extent it means to propose a sort of\njudicially ordained immunity from the terms of the Sherman Act for\nits restraints of trade\u2014that we should overlook its restrictions\nbecause they happen to fall at the intersection of higher\neducation, sports, and money\u2014we cannot agree. This Court has\nregularly refused materially identical requests from litigants\nseeking special dispensation from the Sherman Act on the ground\nthat their restraints of trade serve uniquely important social\nobjectives beyond enhancing competition.Take two examples. InNational Soc. of\nProfessional Engineersv.United States,435 U.S.\n679(1978), a trade association argued that price competition\nbetween engineers competing for building projects had to be\nrestrained to ensure quality work and protect public safety.Id., at 679\u2013680. This Court rejected that appeal as \u201cnothing\nless than a frontal assault on the basic policy of the Sherman\nAct.\u201dId., at 695. The \u201cstatutory policy\u201d of the Act is one\nof competition and it \u201cprecludes inquiry into the question whether\ncompetition is good or bad.\u201dIbid.InFTCv.Superior Court Trial Lawyers Assn.,493\nU.S. 411(1990), criminal defense lawyers agreed among\nthemselves to refuse court appointments until the government\nincreased their compensation.Id.,at 414. And once more the\nCourt refused to consider whether this restraint of trade served\nsome social good more important than competition: \u201cThe social\njustifications proffered for respondents\u2019 restraint of trade\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. do not make it any less unlawful.\u201dId., at\n424.To be sure, this Court once dallied with\nsomething that looks a bit like an antitrust exemption for\nprofessional baseball. InFederal Baseball Club of Baltimore,\nInc.v.National League of Professional Baseball Clubs,259 U.S.\n200(1922), the Court reasoned that \u201cexhibitions\u201d of \u201cbase\nball\u201d did not implicate the Sherman Act because they did not\ninvolve interstate trade or commerce\u2014even though teams regularly\ncrossed state lines (as they do today) to make money and enhance\ntheir commercial success.Id., at 208\u2013209. But this Court\nhas refused to extendFederal Baseball\u2019s reasoning to other\nsports leagues\u2014and has even acknowledged criticisms of the decision\nas \u201c\u00a0\u2018unrealistic\u2019\u00a0\u201d and \u201c\u00a0\u2018inconsistent\u2019\u00a0\u201d and\n\u201caberration[al].\u201dFloodv.Kuhn,407 U.S.\n258, 282 (1972) (quotingRadovichv.National\nFootball League,352 U.S.\n445, 452 (1957)); see also Brief for Advocates for Minor\nLeaguers asAmicus Curiae5, n.\u00a03 (gathering\ncriticisms). Indeed, as we have seen, this Court has already\nrecognized that the NCAA itselfissubject to the Sherman\nAct.The \u201corderly way\u201d to temper that Act\u2019s policy of\ncompetition is \u201cby legislation and not by court decision.\u201dFlood, 407 U.\u00a0S., at 279. The NCAA is free to argue\nthat, \u201cbecause of the special characteristics of [its] particular\nindustry,\u201d it should be exempt from the usual operation of the\nantitrust laws\u2014but that appeal is \u201cproperly addressed to Congress.\u201dNational Soc. of Professional Engineers, 435 U.\u00a0S., at\n689. Nor has Congress been insensitive to such requests. It has\nmodified the antitrust laws for certain industries in the past, and\nit may do so again in the future.

As we have described it, \u201cthe plaintiff has\nthe initial burden to prove that the challenged restraint has a\nsubstantial anticompetitive effect.\u201dIbid.Should the\nplaintiff carry that burden, the burden then \u201cshifts to the\ndefendant to show a procompetitive rationale for the restraint.\u201dIbid.If the defendant can make that showing, \u201cthe burden\nshifts back to the plaintiff to demonstrate that the procompetitive\nefficiencies could be reasonably achieved through less\nanticompetitive means.\u201dId.,at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at\n9\u201310).These three steps do not represent a rote\nchecklist, nor may they be employed as an inflexible substitute for\ncareful analysis. As we have seen, what is required to assess\nwhether a challenged restraint harms competition can vary depending\non the circumstances. Seesupra, at 15\u201319. The whole point\nof the rule of reason is to furnish \u201can enquiry meet for the case,\nlooking to the circumstances, details, and logic of a restraint\u201d to\nensure that it unduly harms competition before a court declares it\nunlawful.California Dental, 526 U.\u00a0S., at 781; see\nalso,e.g.,Leegin Creative, 551 U.\u00a0S., at 885\n(\u201c\u00a0\u2018[T]he factfinder weighs all of the circumstances of a case\nin deciding whether a restrictive practice should be prohibited as\nimposing an unreasonable restraint on competition\u2019\u00a0\u201d);Copperweld Corp.v.Independence Tube Corp.,467 U.S.\n752, 768 (1984); 7 Areeda & Hovenkamp \u00b61507a, at 442\u2013444\n(slightly different \u201cdecisional model\u201d using sequential\nquestions).In the proceedings below, the district court\nfollowed circuit precedent to apply a multistep framework closely\nakin toAmerican Express\u2019s. As its first step, the district\ncourt required the student-athletes to show that \u201cthe challenged\nrestraints produce significant anticompetitive effects in the\nrelevant market.\u201d D. Ct. Op., at 1067. This was no slight burden.\nAccording to oneamicus, courts have disposed of nearly all\nrule of reason cases in the last 45 years on the ground that the\nplaintiff failed to show a substantial anticompetitive effect.\nBrief for 65 Professors of Law, Business, Economics, and Sports\nManagement asAmici Curiae21, n.\u00a09 (\u201cSince 1977,\ncourts decided 90% (809 of 897) on this ground\u201d). This suit proved\ndifferent. As we have seen, based on a voluminous record, the\ndistrict court held that the student-athletes had shown the NCAA\nenjoys the power to set wages in the market for student-athletes\u2019\nlabor\u2014and that the NCAA has exercised that power in ways that have\nproduced significant anticompetitive effects. See D. Ct. Op., at\n1067. Perhaps even more notably, the NCAA \u201cdid not meaningfully\ndispute\u201d this conclusion.Ibid.Unlike so many cases, then, the district court\nproceeded to the second step, asking whether the NCAA could muster\na procompetitive rationale for its restraints.Id., at 1070.\nThis is where the NCAA claims error first crept in. On its account,\nthe district court examined the challenged rules at different\nlevels of generality. At the first step of its inquiry, the court\nasked whether the NCAA\u2019s entire package of compensation\nrestrictions has substantial anticompetitive effectscollectively. Yet, at the second step, the NCAA says the\ndistrict court required it to show that each of its distinct rules\nlimiting student-athlete compensation has procompetitive benefitsindividually. The NCAA says this mismatch had the result of\neffectively\u2014and erroneously\u2014requiring it to prove that each rule is\nthe least restrictive means of achieving the procompetitive purpose\nof differentiating college sports and preserving demand for\nthem.We agree with the NCAA\u2019s premise that antitrust\nlaw does not require businesses to use anything like the least\nrestrictive means of achieving legitimate business purposes. To the\ncontrary, courts should not second-guess \u201cdegrees of reasonable\nnecessity\u201d so that \u201cthe lawfulness of conduct turn[s] upon\njudgments of degrees of efficiency.\u201dRothery Storage, 792\nF.\u00a02d, at 227;Continental T.\u00a0V., Inc.v.GTE\nSylvania Inc.,433 U.S.\n36, 58, n.\u00a029 (1977). That would be a recipe for disaster,\nfor a \u201cskilled lawyer\u201d will \u201chave little difficulty imagining\npossible less restrictive alternatives to most joint arrangements.\u201d\n11 Areeda & Hovenkamp \u00b61913b, p.\u00a0398 (2018). And judicial\nacceptance of such imaginings would risk interfering \u201cwith the\nlegitimate objectives at issue\u201d without\u00a0\u201cadding that much to\ncompetition.\u201d 7id., \u00b61505b, at 435\u2013436.Even worse, \u201c[r]ules that seek to embody every\neconomic complexity and qualification may well, through the\nvagaries of administration, prove counter-productive, undercutting\nthe very economic ends they seek to serve.\u201dBarry Wright\nCorp.v.ITT Grinnell Corp., 724 F.2d 227, 234 (CA1\n1983) (Breyer, J.). After all, even \u201c[u]nder the best of\ncircumstances,\u201d applying the antitrust laws \u201c\u00a0\u2018can be\ndifficult\u2019\u00a0\u201d\u2014and mistaken condemnations of legitimate business\narrangements \u201c\u00a0\u2018are especially costly, because they chill the\nvery\u2019\u00a0\u201d procompetitive conduct \u201c\u00a0\u2018the antitrust laws are\ndesigned to protect.\u2019\u00a0\u201dVerizon Communications Inc.v.Law Offices of Curtis V. Trinko, LLP, 540 U.S. 398, 414\n(2004). Indeed, static judicial decrees in ever-evolving markets\nmay themselves facilitate collusion or frustrate entry and\ncompetition.Ibid.To know that the Sherman Act prohibits\nonlyunreasonablerestraints of trade is thus to know that\nattempts to \u201c\u00a0\u2018[m]ete[r]\u2019 small deviations is not an\nappropriate antitrust function.\u201d Hovenkamp, Antitrust Balancing, 12\nN. Y. U. J.\u00a0L. & Bus. 369, 377 (2016).While we agree with the NCAA\u2019s legal premise, we\ncannot say the same for its factual one. Yes, at the first step of\nits inquiry, the district court held that the student-athletes had\nmet their burden of showing the NCAA\u2019s restraints collectively bear\nan anticompetitive effect. And, given that, yes, at step two the\nNCAA had to show only that those same rules collectively yield a\nprocompetitive benefit. The trouble for the NCAA, though, is not\nthe level of generality. It is the fact that the district court\nfound unpersuasive much of its proffered evidence. See D. Ct. Op.,\nat 1070\u20131076, 1080\u20131083. Recall that the court found the NCAA\nfailed \u201cto establish that the challenged compensation\nrules\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. have any direct connection to consumer\ndemand.\u201dId.,at 1070.To be sure, there is a wrinkle here. While\nfinding the NCAA had failed to establish that its rules\ncollectively sustain consumer demand, the court did find that\n\u201csome\u201d of those rules \u201cmay\u201d have procompetitive effects \u201cto the\nextent\u201d they prohibit compensation \u201cunrelated to education, akin to\nsalaries seen in professional sports leagues.\u201dId.,at\n1082\u20131083. The court then proceeded to what corresponds to the\nthird step of theAmerican Expressframework, where it\nrequired the student-athletes \u201cto show that there are substantially\nless restrictive alternative rules that would achieve the same\nprocompetitive effect as the challenged set of rules.\u201d D. Ct.\nOp., at 1104. And there, of course, the district court held\nthat the student-athletes partially succeeded\u2014they were able to\nshow that the NCAA could achieve the procompetitive benefits it had\nestablished with substantially less restrictive restraints on\neducation-related benefits.Even acknowledging this wrinkle, we see nothing\nabout the district court\u2019s analysis that offends the legal\nprinciples the NCAA invokes. The court\u2019s judgment ultimately turned\non the key question at the third step: whether the student-athletes\ncould prove that \u201csubstantially less restrictive alternative rules\u201d\nexisted to achieve the same procompetitive benefits the NCAA had\nproven at the second step.Ibid.Of course, deficiencies in\nthe NCAA\u2019s proof of procompetitive benefits at the second step\ninfluenced the analysis at the third. But that is only because,\nhowever framed and at whichever step, anticompetitive restraints of\ntrade may wind up flunking the rule of reason to the extent the\nevidence shows that substantially less restrictive means exist to\nachieve any proven procompetitive benefits. See,e.g.,7\nAreeda & Hovenkamp \u00b61505, p. 428 (\u201cTo be sure, these two\nquestions can be collapsed into one,\u201d since a \u201clegitimate objective\nthat is not promoted by the challenged restraint can be equally\nserved by simply abandoning the restraint, which is surely a less\nrestrictive alternative\u201d).Simply put, the district court nowhere\u2014expressly\nor effectively\u2014required the NCAA to show that its rules constituted\ntheleastrestrictive means of preserving consumer demand.\nRather, it was only after finding the NCAA\u2019s restraints\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018patently and inexplicably stricter than is\nnecessary\u2019\u00a0\u201d to achieve the procompetitive benefits the league\nhad demonstrated that the district court proceeded to declare a\nviolation of the Sherman Act. D. Ct. Op., at 1104. That demanding\nstandard hardly presages a future filled with judicial\nmicromanagement of legitimate business decisions.BIn a related critique, the NCAA contends the\ndistrict court \u201cimpermissibly redefined\u201d its \u201cproduct\u201d by rejecting\nits views about what amateurism requires and replacing them with\nits preferred conception. Brief for Petitioner in No. 20\u2013512, at\n35\u201336.This argument, however, misapprehends the way a\ndefendant\u2019s procompetitive business justification relates to the\nantitrust laws. Firms deserve substantial latitude to fashion\nagreements that serve legitimate business interests\u2014agreements that\nmay include efforts aimed at introducing a new product into the\nmarketplace.Supra, at 15\u201319. But none of that means a party\ncan relabel a restraint as a product feature and declare it \u201cimmune\nfrom \u00a71 scrutiny.\u201dAmerican Needle, 560 U.\u00a0S., at 199,\nn.\u00a07. In this suit, as in any, the district court had to\ndetermine whether the defendants\u2019 agreements harmed competition and\nwhether any procompetitive benefits associated with their\nrestraints could be achieved by \u201csubstantially less restrictive\nalternative\u201d means. D. Ct. Op., at 1104.The NCAA\u2019s argument not only misapprehends the\ninquiry, it would require us to overturn the district court\u2019s\nfactual findings. While the NCAA asks us to defer to its conception\nof amateurism, the district court found that the NCAA had not\nadopted any consistent definition.Id.,at 1070. Instead,\nthe court found, the NCAA\u2019s rules and restrictions on compensation\nhave shifted markedly over time.Id.,at 1071\u20131074. The\ncourt found, too, that the NCAA adopted these restrictions without\nany reference to \u201cconsiderations of consumer demand,\u201did.,\nat 1100, and that some were \u201cnot necessary to preserve consumer\ndemand,\u201did., at 1075, 1080, 1104. None of this is product\nredesign; it is a straightforward application of the rule of\nreason.CFinally, the NCAA attacks as \u201cindefensible\u201d\nthe lower courts\u2019 holding that substantially less restrictive\nalternatives exist capable of delivering the same procompetitive\nbenefits as its current rules. Brief for Petitioner in No. 20\u2013512,\nat 46. The NCAA claims, too, that the district court\u2019s injunction\nthreatens to \u201cmicromanage\u201d its business.Id., at 50.Once more, we broadly agree with the legal\nprinciples the NCAA invokes. As we have discussed, antitrust courts\nmust give wide berth to business judgments before finding\nliability. Seesupra, at 15\u201319. Similar considerations apply\nwhen it comes to the remedy. Judges must be sensitive to the\npossibility that the \u201ccontinuing supervision of a highly detailed\ndecree\u201d could wind up impairing rather than enhancing competition.Trinko, 540 U.\u00a0S., at 415. Costs associated with\nensuring compliance with judicial decrees may exceed efficiencies\ngained; the decrees themselves may unintentionally suppress\nprocompetitive innovation and even facilitate collusion. Seesupra, at 26\u201327. Judges must be wary, too, of the temptation\nto specify \u201cthe proper price, quantity, and other terms of\ndealing\u201d\u2014cognizant that they are neither economic nor industry\nexperts.Trinko, 540 U.\u00a0S., at 408. Judges must be open\nto reconsideration and modification of decrees in light of changing\nmarket realities, for \u201cwhat we see may vary over time.\u201dCalifornia Dental, 526 U.\u00a0S., at 781. And throughout\ncourts must have a healthy respect for the practical limits of\njudicial administration: \u201cAn antitrust court is unlikely to be an\neffective day-to-day enforcer\u201d of a detailed decree, able to keep\npace with changing market dynamics alongside a busy docket.Trinko, 540 U.\u00a0S., at 415. Nor should any court\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018impose a duty .\u00a0.\u00a0. that it cannot explain or\nadequately and reasonably supervise.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIbid.In short,\njudges make for poor \u201ccentral planners\u201d and should never aspire to\nthe role.Id., at 408.Once again, though, we think the district court\nhonored these principles. The court enjoined only restraints on\neducation-related benefits\u2014such as those limiting scholarships for\ngraduate school, payments for tutoring, and the like. The court did\nso, moreover, only after finding that relaxing these restrictions\nwould not blur the distinction between college and professional\nsports and thus impair demand\u2014and only after finding that this\ncourse represented a significantly (not marginally) less\nrestrictive means of achieving the same procompetitive benefits as\nthe NCAA\u2019s current rules. D. Ct. Op., at 1104\u20131105.Even with respect to education-related benefits,\nthe district court extended the NCAA considerable leeway. As we\nhave seen, the court provided that the NCAA could develop its own\ndefinition of benefits that relate to education and seek\nmodification of the court\u2019s injunction to reflect that definition.\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 20\u2013512, at 168a, \u00b64. The court\nexplained that the NCAA and its members could agree on rules\nregulating how conferences and schools go about providing these\neducation-related benefits.Ibid.The court said that the\nNCAA and its members could continue fixing education-related cash\nawards, too\u2014so long as those \u201climits are never lower than the\nlimit\u201d on awards for athletic performance. D. Ct. Op., at 1104;\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 20\u2013512, at 168a\u2013169a, \u00b65. And the\ncourt emphasized that its injunction applies only to the NCAA and\nmulticonference agreements; individual conferences remain free to\nreimpose every single enjoined restraint tomorrow\u2014or more\nrestrictive ones still.Id.,at 169a\u2013170a, \u00b6\u00b66\u20137.In the end, it turns out that the NCAA\u2019s\ncomplaints really boil down to three principal objections.First, the NCAA worries about the district\ncourt\u2019s inclusion of paid posteligibility internships among the\neducation-related benefits it approved. The NCAA fears that schools\nwill use internships as a way of circumventing limits on payments\nthat student-athletes may receive for athletic performance. The\nNCAA even imagines that boosters might promise posteligibility\ninternships \u201cat a sneaker company or auto dealership\u201d with\nextravagant salaries as a \u201cthinly disguised vehicle\u201d for paying\nprofessional-level salaries. Brief for Petitioner in No. 20\u2013512, at\n37\u201338.This argument rests on an overly broad reading\nof the injunction. The district court enjoined only restrictions on\neducation-related compensation or benefits \u201cthat may be made\navailablefrom conferences or schools.\u201d App. to Pet. for\nCert. in No. 20\u2013512, at 167a, \u00b61 (emphasis added). Accordingly, as\nthe student-athletes concede, the injunction \u201cdoes not stop the\nNCAA from continuing to prohibit compensation from\u201d sneaker\ncompanies, auto dealerships, boosters, \u201cor anyone else.\u201d Brief for\nRespondents 47\u201348; see also Brief for United States asAmicus\nCuriae33. The NCAA itself seems to understand this much.\nFollowing the district court\u2019s injunction, the organization adopted\nnew regulations specifying that only \u201ca conference or institution\u201d\nmay fund post-eligibility internships. See Decl. of M. Boyer in No.\n4:14\u2013md\u201302541, ECF Doc. 1302\u20132, p.\u00a06 (ND Cal., Sept. 22, 2020)\n(NCAA Bylaw 16.3.4(d)).Even when it comes to internships offered by\nconferences and schools, the district court left the NCAA\nconsiderable flexibility. The court refused to enjoin NCAA rules\nprohibiting its members from providing compensation or benefits\nunrelated to legitimate educational activities\u2014thus leaving the\nleague room to police phony internships. As we\u2019ve observed, the\ndistrict court also allowed the NCAA to propose (and enforce) rules\ndefining what benefits do and do not relate to education. App. to\nPet. for Cert. in No. 20\u2013512, at 168a, \u00b64. Accordingly, the NCAA\nmay seek whatever limits on paid internships it thinks appropriate.\nAnd, again, the court stressed that individual conferences may\nrestrict internships however they wish.Id.,at 169a, \u00b66.\nAll these features underscore the modesty of the current\ndecree.Second, the NCAA attacks the district court\u2019s\nruling that it may fix the aggregate limit on awards schools may\ngive for \u201cacademic or graduation\u201d achievement no lower than its\naggregate limit on parallel athletic awards (currently $5,980 per\nyear).Id.,at 168a\u2013169a, \u00b65; D. Ct. Op., at 1104. This, the\nNCAA asserts, \u201cis the very definition of a professional salary.\u201d\nBrief for Petitioner in No. 20\u2013512, at 48. The NCAA also represents\nthat \u201c[m]ost\u201d of its currently permissible athletic awards are \u201cfor\ngenuine individual or teamachievement\u201d and that \u201c[m]ost\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. are received by only a few student-athletes each\nyear.\u201dIbid.Meanwhile, the NCAA says, the district court\u2019s\ndecree would allow a school to pay players thousands of dollars\neach year for minimal achievements like maintaining a passing GPA.Ibid.The basis for this critique is unclear. The NCAA\ndoes not believe that the athletic awards it presently allows are\ntantamount to a professional salary. And this portion of the\ninjunction sprang directly from the district court\u2019s finding that\nthe cap on athletic participation awards \u201cis an amount that has\nbeen shown not to decrease consumer demand.\u201d D. Ct. Op., at 1088.\nIndeed, there was no evidence before the district court suggesting\nthat corresponding academic awards would impair consumer interest\nin any way. Again, too, the district court\u2019s injunction affords the\nNCAA leeway. It leaves the NCAA free to reduce its athletic awards.\nAnd it does not ordain what criteria schools must use for their\nacademic and graduation awards. So, once more, if the NCAA believes\ncertain criteria are needed to ensure that academic awards are\nlegitimately related to education, it is presently free to propose\nsuch rules\u2014and individual conferences may adopt even stricter\nones.Third, the NCAA contends that allowing schools\nto provide in-kind educational benefits will pose a problem. This\nrelief focuses on allowing schools to offer scholarships for\n\u201cgraduate degrees\u201d or \u201cvocational school\u201d and to pay for things\nlike \u201ccomputers\u201d and \u201ctutoring.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. in No.\n20\u2013512, at 167a\u2013168a, \u00b62. But the NCAA fears schools might exploit\nthis authority to give student-athletes \u201c\u00a0\u2018luxury cars\u2019\u00a0\u201d\n\u201cto get to class\u201d and \u201cother unnecessary or inordinately valuable\nitems\u201d only \u201cnominally\u201d related to education. Brief for Petitioner\nin No. 20\u2013512, at 48\u201349.Again, however, this over-reads the injunction\nin ways we have seen and need not belabor. Under the current\ndecree, the NCAA is free to forbid in-kind benefits unrelated to a\nstudent\u2019s actual education; nothing stops it from enforcing a \u201cno\nLamborghini\u201d rule. And, again, the district court invited the NCAA\nto specify and later enforce rules delineating which benefits it\nconsiders legitimately related to education. To the extent the NCAA\nbelieves meaningful ambiguity really exists about the scope of its\nauthority\u2014regarding internships, academic awards, in-kind benefits,\nor anything else\u2014it has been free to seek clarification from the\ndistrict court since the court issued its injunction three years\nago. The NCAA remains free to do so today. To date, the NCAA has\nsought clarification only once\u2014about the precise amount at which it\ncan cap academic awards\u2014and the question was quickly resolved.\nBefore conjuring hypothetical concerns in this Court, we believe it\nbest for the NCAA to present any practically important question it\nhas in district court first.When it comes to fashioning an antitrust remedy,\nwe acknowledge that caution is key. Judges must resist the\ntemptation to require that enterprises employ the least restrictive\nmeans of achieving their legitimate business objectives. Judges\nmust be mindful, too, of their limitations\u2014as generalists, as\nlawyers, and as outsiders trying to understand intricate business\nrelationships. Judges must remain aware that markets are often more\neffective than the heavy hand of judicial power when it comes to\nenhancing consumer welfare. And judges must be open to clarifying\nand reconsidering their decrees in light of changing market\nrealities. Courts reviewing complex business arrangements should,\nin other words, be wary about invitations to \u201cset sail on a sea of\ndoubt.\u201dUnited Statesv.Addyston Pipe & Steel\nCo., 85 F. 271, 284 (CA6 1898) (Taft, J.). But we do not\nbelieve the district court fell prey to that temptation. Its\njudgment does not float on a sea of doubt but stands on firm\nground\u2014an exhaustive factual record, a thoughtful legal analysis\nconsistent with established antitrust principles, and a healthy\ndose of judicial humility.*Some will think the district court did not go\nfar enough. By permitting colleges and universities to offer\nenhanced education-related benefits, its decision may encourage\nscholastic achievement and allow student-athletes a measure of\ncompensation more consistent with the value they bring to their\nschools. Still, some will see this as a poor substitute for fuller\nrelief. At the same time, others will think the district court went\ntoo far by undervaluing the social benefits associated with amateur\nathletics. For our part, though, we can only agree with the Ninth\nCircuit: \u201c\u00a0\u2018The national debate about amateurism in college\nsports is important. But our task as appellate judges is not to\nresolve it. Nor could we. Our task is simply to review the district\ncourt judgment through the appropriate lens of antitrust\nlaw.\u2019\u00a0\u201d 958 F.\u00a03d, at 1265. That review persuades us the\ndistrict court acted within the law\u2019s bounds.The judgment isAffirmed.",
