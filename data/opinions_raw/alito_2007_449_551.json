S.\u00a0C. \u00a7441b(b)(2) (2000 ed., Supp. IV), as\napplied, cannot constitutionally ban any advertisement that may\nreasonably be interpreted as anything other than an appeal to vote\nfor or against a candidate, (b) that the ads at issue here may\nreasonably be interpreted as something other than such an appeal,\nand (c) that because \u00a7203 is unconstitutional as applied to the\nadvertisements before us, it is unnecessary to go further and\ndecide whether \u00a7203 is unconstitutional on its face. If it turns\nout that the implementation of the as-applied standard set out in\nthe principal opinion impermissibly chills political speech, seepost,at 15\u201316 (Scalia, J., joined by Kennedy, and Thomas,\nJJ., concurring in part and concurring in judgment), we will\npresumably be asked in a future case to reconsider the holding inMcConnellv.Federal Election Comm\u2019n,540 U. S. 93(2003), that\n\u00a7203 is facially constitutional.",
