    "text": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES_________________No. 12\u2013133_________________AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY, et\u00a0al.,\nPETITIONERS v. ITALIAN COLORS RESTAURANT et\u00a0al.on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the second circuit[June 20, 2013]Justice Thomas,\nconcurring.I join the\nCourt\u2019s opinion in full. I write separately to note that the\nresult here is also required by the plain meaning of the Federal\nArbitration Act. In AT&T Mobil- ity LLC v. Concepcion, 563\nU.\u00a0S. ___ (2011), I explained that \u201cthe FAA requires\nthat an agreement to arbitrate be enforced unless a party\nsuccessfully challenges the forma- tion of the arbitration\nagreement, such as by proving fraud or duress.\u201d Id., at ___\n(concurring opinion) (slip op., at 1\u20132). In this case,\nItalian Colors makes two arguments to support its conclusion that\nthe arbitration agreement should not be enforced. First, it\ncontends that enforcing the arbitration agreement \u201cwould\ncontravene the policies of the antitrust laws.\u201d Ante, at 4.\nSecond, it contends that a court may \u201cinvalidate agreements\nthat prevent the \u2018ef- fective vindication\u2019 of a federal\nstatutory right.\u201d Ante, at 6. Neither argument\n\u201cconcern[s] whether the contract was properly made,\u201d\nConcepcion, supra, at ___ (Thomas, J., concurring) (slip op., at\n5\u20136). Because Italian Colors has not furnished \u201cgrounds\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. for the revocation of any contract,\u201d 9\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72, the arbitration agreement must be\nenforced. Italian Colors voluntarily entered into a con- tract\ncontaining a bilateral arbitration provision. It cannot now escape\nits obligations merely because the claim it wishes to bring might\nbe economically infeasible.",
