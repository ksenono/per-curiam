SESSIONS, III, ATTORNEY GENERALon writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the first circuit[June 21, 2018]Justice Sotomayor delivered the opinion of the\nCourt.Nonpermanent residents, like petitioner here,\nwho are subject to removal proceedings and have accrued 10 years of\ncontinuous physical presence in the United States, may be eligible\nfor a form of discretionary relief known as cancellation of\nremoval. 8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71229b(b)(1). Under the so-called\n\u201cstop-time rule\u201d set forth in \u00a71229b(d)(1)(A), however, that period\nof continuous physical presence is \u201cdeemed to end .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nwhen the alien is served a notice to appear under section 1229(a).\u201d\nSection 1229(a), in turn, provides that the Government shall serve\nnoncitizens in removal proceedings with \u201cwritten notice (in this\nsection referred to as a \u2018notice to appear\u2019) .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nspecifying\u201d several required pieces of information, including\n\u201c[t]he time and place at which the [removal] proceedings will be\nheld.\u201d \u00a71229(a)(1)(G)(i).[1]The narrow question in this case lies at the\nintersectionof those statutory provisions. If the Government\nserves a noncitizen with a document that is labeled \u201cnotice to\nappear,\u201d but the document fails to specify either the time or place\nof the removal proceedings, does it trigger the stop-time rule? The\nanswer is as obvious\u00a0as it seems: No. A notice that does not\ninform a noncitizen when and where to appear for removal\nproceedings is not a \u201cnotice to appear under section 1229(a)\u201d and\ntherefore does not trigger the stop-time rule. The plain text, the\nstatutory context, and common sense all lead inescapably and\nunambiguously to that conclusion.IAUnder the Illegal Immigration Reform and\nImmigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA), 110Stat. 3009\u2013546,\nthe Attorney General of the United States has discretion to \u201ccancel\nremoval\u201d and adjust the status of certain nonpermanent residents.\n\u00a71229b(b). To be eligible for such relief, a nonpermanent resident\nmust meet certain enumerated criteria, the relevant one here being\nthat the noncitizen must have \u201cbeen physically present in the\nUnited States for a continuous period of not less than 10 years\nimmediately preceding the date of [an] application\u201d for\ncancellation of removal. \u00a71229b(b)(1)(A).[2]IIRIRA also established the stop-time rule at\nissue in this case. Under that rule, \u201cany period of .\u00a0.\u00a0.\ncontinuous physical presence in the United States shall be deemed\nto end .\u00a0.\u00a0. when the alien is served a notice to appear\nunder section 1229(a) of this title.\u201d[3] \u00a71229b(d)(1)(A). Section 1229(a), in turn, provides\nthat \u201cwritten notice (in this section referred to as a \u2018notice to\nappear\u2019) shall be given .\u00a0.\u00a0. to the alien\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. specifying\u201d:\u201c(A) The nature of the proceedings against the\nalien.\u201c(B) The legal authority under which the\nproceedings are conducted.\u201c(C) The acts or conduct alleged to be in\nviolation of law.\u201c(D) The charges against the alien and the\nstatutory provisions alleged to have been violated.\u201c(E) The alien may be represented by counsel\nand the alien will be provided (i) a period of time to secure\ncounsel under subsection (b)(1) of this section and (ii) a current\nlist of counsel prepared under subsection (b)(2) of this\nsection.\u201c(F)(i) The requirement that the alien must\nimmediately provide (or have provided) the Attorney General with a\nwritten record of an address and telephone number (if any) at which\nthe alien may be contacted respecting proceedings under section\n1229a of this title.\u201c(ii) The requirement that the alien must\nprovide the Attorney General immediately with a written record of\nany change of the alien\u2019s address or telephone number.\u201c(iii) The consequences under section\n1229a(b)(5) of this title of failure to provide address and\ntelephone information pursuant to this subparagraph.\u201c(G)(i) The time and place at which the\n[removal] proceedings will be held.\u201c(ii) The consequences under section 1229a(b)(5)\nof this title of the failure, except under exceptional cir-cumstances, to appear at such proceedings.\u201d\n\u00a71229(a)(1) (boldface added).The statute also enables the Government to\n\u201cchange or postpon[e] .\u00a0.\u00a0. the time and place of [the\nremoval] proceedings.\u201d \u00a71229(a)(2)(A). To do so, the Government\nmust give the noncitizen \u201ca written notice .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nspecifying .\u00a0.\u00a0. the new time or place of the\nproceedings\u201d and \u201cthe consequences .\u00a0.\u00a0. of failing,\nexcept under exceptional circumstances, to attend such\nproceedings.\u201dIbid.The Government is not required to\nprovide written notice of the change in time or place of the\nproceedings if the noncitizen is \u201cnot in detention\u201d and \u201chas failed\nto provide [his] address\u201d to the Government. \u00a71229(a)(2)(B).The consequences of a noncitizen\u2019s failure to\nappear at a removal proceeding can be quite severe. If a noncitizen\nwho has been properly served with the \u201cwritten notice required\nunder paragraph (1) or (2) of section 1229(a)\u201d fails to appear at a\nremoval proceeding, he \u201cshall be ordered removed in absentia\u201d if\nthe Government \u201cestablishes by clear, unequivocal, and convincing\nevidence that the written notice was so provided and that the alien\nis removable.\u201d \u00a71229a(b)(5)(A). Absent \u201cexceptional circumstances,\u201d\na noncitizen subject to an in absentia removal order is ineligible\nfor some forms of discretionary relief for 10 years if, \u201cat the\ntime of the notice described in paragraph (1) or (2) of section\n1229(a),\u201d he \u201cwas provided oral notice .\u00a0.\u00a0. of the time\nand place of the proceedings and of the consequences\u201d of failing to\nappear. \u00a71229a(b)(7). In certain limited circumstances, however, a\nremoval order entered in absentia may be rescinded\u2014e.g.,when the noncitizen \u201cdemonstrates that [he] did not receive notice\nin accordance with paragraph (1) or (2) of section 1229(a).\u201d\n\u00a71229a(b)(5)(C)(ii).BIn 1997, shortly after Congress passed IIRIRA,\nthe Attorney General promulgated a regulation stating that a\n\u201cnotice to appear\u201d served on a noncitizen need only provide \u201cthe\ntime, place and date of the initial removal hearing, where\npracticable.\u201d 62 Fed. Reg. 10332 (1997). Per that\nregulation, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), at least in\nrecent years, almost always serves noncitizens with notices that\nfail to specify the time, place, or date of initial removal\nhearings whenever the agency deems it impracticable to include such\ninformation. See Brief for Petitioner 14; Brief for Respondent\n48\u201349; Tr. of Oral Arg. 52\u201353 (Government\u2019s admission that \u201calmost\n100 percent\u201d of \u201cnotices to appear omit the time and date of the\nproceeding over the last three years\u201d). Instead, these notices\nstate that the times, places, or dates of the initial hearings are\n\u201cto be determined.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 14.InMatter of Camarillo, 25\nI.\u00a0&\u00a0N. Dec. 644 (2011), the Board of Immigration\nAppeals (BIA) addressed whether such notices trigger the stop-time\nrule even if they do not specify the time and date of the removal\nproceedings. The BIA concluded that they do.Id.,at 651. It\nreasoned that the statutory phrase \u201cnotice to appear \u2018under section\n[1229](a)\u2019\u00a0\u201d in the stop-time rule \u201cmerely specifies the\ndocument the DHS must serve on the alien to trigger the \u2018stop-time\u2019\nrule,\u201d but otherwise imposes no \u201csubstantive requirements\u201d as to\nwhat information that document must include to trigger the\nstop-time rule.Id.,at 647.CPetitioner Wescley Fonseca Pereira is a native\nand citizen of Brazil. In 2000, at age 19, he was admitted to the\nUnited\u00a0States as a temporary \u201cnon-immigrant visitor.\u201d App. to\nPet. for Cert. 3a. After his visa expired, he remained in the\nUnited\u00a0States. Pereira is married and has two young daughters,\nboth of whom are United\u00a0States citizens. He works as a\nhandyman and, according to submissions before the Immigration\nCourt, is a well-respected member of his community.In 2006, Pereira was arrested in Massachusetts\nfor operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol. On\nMay 31, 2006, while Pereira was detained, DHS served him (in\nperson) with a document labeled \u201cNotice to Appear.\u201d App. 7\u201313. That\nputative notice charged Pereira as removable for overstaying his\nvisa, informed him that \u201cremoval proceedings\u201d were being initiated\nagainst him, and provided him with information about the \u201c[c]onduct\nof the hearing\u201d and the consequences for failing to appear.Id., at 7, 10\u201312. Critical here, the notice did not specify\nthe date and time of Pereira\u2019s removal hearing. Instead, it ordered\nhim to appear before an Immigration Judge in Boston \u201cona date\nto be setata time to be set.\u201dId., at 9\n(underlining in original).More than a year later, on August 9, 2007, DHS\nfiled the 2006 notice with the Boston Immigration Court. The\nImmigration Court thereafter attempted to mail Pereira a more\nspecific notice setting the date and time for his initial removal\nhearing for October 31, 2007, at 9:30 a.m. But that second notice\nwas sent to Pereira\u2019s street address rather than his post office\nbox (which he had provided to DHS), so it was returned as\nundeliverable. Because Pe- reira never received notice of the time\nand date of his re- moval hearing, he failed to appear, and the\nImmigration Court ordered him removed in absentia. Unaware of that\nre- moval order, Pereira remained in the United States.In 2013, after Pereira had been in the country\nfor more than 10 years, he was arrested for a minor motor vehicle\nviolation (driving without his headlights on) and was subsequently\ndetained by DHS. The Immigration Court reopened the removal\nproceedings after Pereira demonstrated that he never received the\nImmigration Court\u2019s 2007 notice setting out the specific date and\ntime of his hearing. Pereira then applied for cancellation of\nremoval, arguing that the stop-time rule was not triggered by DHS\u2019\ninitial 2006 notice because the document lacked information about\nthe time and date of his removal hearing.The Immigration Court disagreed, finding the law\n\u201cquite settled that DHS need not put a date certain on the Notice\nto Appear in order to make that document effective.\u201d App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 23a. The Immigration Court therefore concluded that\nPereira could not meet the 10-year physical-presence requirement\nunder \u00a71229b(b), thereby render- ing him statutorily ineligible for\ncancellation of removal, and ordered Pereira removed from the\ncountry. The BIA dismissed Pereira\u2019s appeal. Adhering to its\nprecedent inCamarillo, the BIA agreed with the Immigration\nCourt that the 2006 notice triggered the stop-time rule and that\nPereira thus failed to satisfy the 10-year physical-presence\nrequirement and was ineligible for cancellation of removal.The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit\ndenied Pereira\u2019s petition for review of the BIA\u2019s order. 866\nF.\u00a03d 1 (2017). Applying the framework set forth inChevron\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0A. Inc.v.Natural Resources Defense\nCouncil, Inc., 467 U.\u00a0S. 837 (1984), the Court of Appeals\nfirst found that the stop-time rule in \u00a71229b(d)(1) is ambiguous\nbecause it \u201cdoes not explicitly state that the date and time of the\nhearing must be included in a notice to appear in order to cut off\nan alien\u2019s period of continuous physical presence.\u201d 866 F.\u00a03d,\nat 5. Then, after reviewing the statutory text and structure, the\nadministrative context, and pertinent legislative history, the\nCourt of Appeals held that the BIA\u2019s interpretation of the\nstop-time rule was a permissible reading of the statute.Id.,at 6\u20138.IIAThe Court granted certiorari in this case, 583\nU.\u00a0S. ___ (2018), to resolve division among the Courts of\nAppeals on a simple, but important, question of statutory\ninterpretation: Does service of a document styled as a \u201cnotice to\nappear\u201d that fails to specify \u201cthe items listed\u201d in \u00a71229(a)(1)\ntrigger the stop-time rule?[4]\nPet. for Cert. i.As a threshold matter, the Court notes that the\nquestion presented by Pereira, which focuses on all \u201citems listed\u201d\nin \u00a71229(a)(1), sweeps more broadly than necessary to resolve the\nparticular case before us. Although the time-and-place information\nin a notice to appear will vary from case to case, the Government\nacknowledges that \u201c[m]uch of the information Section 1229(a)(1)\ncalls for does not\u201d change and is therefore \u201cincluded in\nstandardized language on the I\u2013862 notice-to-appear form.\u201d Brief\nfor Respondent 36 (referencing 8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7\u00a71229(a)(1)(A)\u2013(B), (E)\u2013(F), and (G)(ii)). In fact, the\nGovernment\u2019s 2006 notice to Pereira included all of the information\nrequired by \u00a71229(a)(1), except it failed to specify the date and\ntime of Pereira\u2019s removal proceedings. See App. 10\u201312. Accordingly,\nthe dispositive question in this case is much narrower, but no less\nvital: Does a \u201cnotice to appear\u201d that does not specify the \u201ctime\nand place at which the proceedings will be held,\u201d as required by\n\u00a71229(a)(1)(G)(i), trigger the stop-time rule?[5]In addressing that narrower question, the Court\nneed not resort toChevrondeference, as some lower courts\nhave done, for Congress has supplied a clear and unambiguous answer\nto the interpretive question at hand. See 467 U.\u00a0S., at\n842\u2013843 (\u201cIf the intent of Congress is clear, that is the end of\nthe matter; for the court, as well as the agency, must give effect\nto the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress\u201d). A putative\nnotice to appear that fails to designate the specific time or place\nof the noncitizen\u2019s removal proceedings is not a \u201cnotice to appear\nunder section 1229(a),\u201d and so does not trigger the stop-time\nrule.BThe statutory text alone is enough to resolve\nthis case. Under the stop-time rule, \u201cany period of .\u00a0.\u00a0.\ncontinuous physical presence\u201d is \u201cdeemed to end .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nwhen the alien is served a notice to appear under section 1229(a).\u201d\n8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71229b(d)(1). By expressly referencing\n\u00a71229(a), the statute specifies where to look to find out what\n\u201cnotice to appear\u201d means. Section 1229(a), in turn, clarifies that\nthe type of notice \u201creferred to as a \u2018notice to appear\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nthroughout the statutory section is a \u201cwritten notice\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. specifying,\u201d as relevant here, \u201c[t]he time and\nplace at which the [removal] proceedings will be held.\u201d\n\u00a71229(a)(1)(G)(i). Thus, based on the plain text of the statute, it\nis clear that to trigger the stop-time rule, the Government must\nserve a notice to appear that, at the very least, \u201cspecif[ies]\u201d the\n\u201ctime and place\u201d of the removal proceedings.It is true, as the Government and dissent point\nout, that the stop-time rule makes broad reference to a notice\ntoappear under \u201csection 1229(a),\u201d which includes\nparagraph\u00a0(1), as well as paragraphs (2) and (3). See Brief\nfor Respondent 27\u201328;post,at 5\u20136 (opinion of Alito, J.).\nBut the broad reference to \u00a71229(a) is of no consequence, because,\nas even the Government concedes, only paragraph (1) bears on the\nmeaning of a \u201cnotice to appear.\u201d Brief for Respondent 27. By\ncontrast, paragraph (2) governs the \u201c[n]otice of change in time or\nplace of proceedings,\u201d and paragraph\u00a0(3) provides for a system\nto record noncitizens\u2019 addresses and phone numbers. Nowhere else\nwithin \u00a71229(a) does the statute purport to delineate the\nrequirements of a \u201cnotice to appear.\u201d In fact, the term \u201cnotice to\nappear\u201d appears only in paragraph (1) of \u00a71229(a).If anything, paragraph (2) of \u00a71229(a) actually\nbolsters the Court\u2019s interpretation of the statute. Paragraph (2)\nprovides that, \u201cin the case of any change or postponement in the\ntime and place of [removal] proceedings,\u201d the Government shall give\nthe noncitizen \u201cwritten notice .\u00a0.\u00a0. specifying\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. the new time or place of the proceedings.\u201d\n\u00a71229(a)(2)(A)(i). By allowing for a \u201cchange or postponement\u201d of\nthe proceedings to a \u201cnew time or place,\u201d paragraph (2) presumes\nthat the Government has already served a \u201cnotice to appear under\nsection 1229(a)\u201d that specified a time and place as required by\n\u00a71229(a)(1)(G)(i). Otherwise, there would be no time or place to\n\u201cchange or postpon[e\u00a0].\u201d \u00a71229(a)(2). Notably, the dissent\nconcedes that paragraph (2) confirms that a notice to appear must\n\u201cstate the \u2018time and place\u2019 of the removal proceeding as required\nby \u00a71229(a)(1).\u2019\u00a0\u201dPost,at 13. The dissent\nnevertheless retorts that this point is \u201centirely irrelevant.\u201dIbid.Not so. Paragraph (2) clearly reinforces the\nconclusion that \u201ca notice to appear under section 1229(a),\u201d\n\u00a71229b(d)(1), must include at least the time and place of the\nremoval proceedings to trigger the stop-time rule.Another neighboring statutory provision lends\nfurther contextual support for the view that a \u201cnotice to appear\u201d\nmust include the time and place of the removal proceedings to\ntrigger the stop-time rule. Section 1229(b)(1) gives a noncitizen\n\u201cthe opportunity to secure counsel before the first [removal]\nhearing date\u201d by mandating that such \u201chearing date shall not be\nscheduled earlier than 10 days after the service of the notice to\nappear.\u201d For \u00a71229(b)(1) to have any meaning, the \u201cnotice to\nappear\u201d must specify the time and place that the noncitizen, and\nhis counsel, must appear at the removal hearing. Otherwise, the\nGovernment could serve a document labeled \u201cnotice to appear\u201d\nwithout listing the time and location of the hearing and then,\nyears down the line, provide that information a day before the\nremoval hearing when it becomes available. Under that view of the\nstatute, a noncitizen theoretically would have had the \u201copportunity\nto secure counsel,\u201d but that opportunity will not be meaningful if,\ngiven the absence of a specified time and place, the noncitizen has\nminimal time and incentive to plan accordingly, and his counsel, in\nturn, receives limited notice and time to prepare adequately. It\ntherefore follows that, if a \u201cnotice to appear\u201d for purposes of\n\u00a71229(b)(1) must include the time-and-place information, a \u201cnotice\nto appear\u201d for purposes of the stop-time rule under \u00a71229b(d)(1)\nmust as well. After all, \u201cit is a normal rule of statutory\nconstruction that identical words used in different parts of the\nsame act are intended to have the same meaning.\u201dTaniguchiv.Kan Pacific Saipan, Ltd., 566 U.\u00a0S. 560, 571 (2012)\n(internal quotation marks omitted).[6]Finally, common sense compels the conclusion\nthat a notice that does not specify when and where to appear for a\nremoval proceeding is not a \u201cnotice to appear\u201d that triggers the\nstop-time rule. If the three words \u201cnotice to appear\u201d mean anything\nin this context, they must mean that, at a minimum, the Government\nhas to provide noncitizens \u201cnotice\u201d of the information,i.e.,the \u201ctime\u201d and \u201cplace,\u201d that would enable them \u201cto\nappear\u201d at the removal hearing in the first place. Conveying such\ntime-and-place information to a noncitizen is an essential function\nof a notice to appear, for without it, the Government cannot\nreason- ably expect the noncitizen to appear for his removal\nproceedings. To hold otherwise would empower the Government to\ntrigger the stop-time rule merely by sending noncitizens a\nbarebones document labeled \u201cNotice to Appear,\u201d with no mention of\nthe time and place of the removal proceedings, even though such\ndocuments would do little if anything to facilitate appearance at\nthose proceedings.[7]\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018We are not willing to impute to Congress .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nsuch [a] contradictory and absurd purpose,\u2019\u00a0\u201dUnited\nStatesv.Bryan, 339 U.\u00a0S. 323, 342 (1950),\nparticularly where doing so has no basis in the statutory text.IIIStraining to inject ambiguity into the\nstatute, the Government and the dissent advance several overlapping\narguments. None is persuasive.AFirst, the Government posits that \u00a71229(a) \u201cis\nnot worded in the form of a definition\u201d and thus cannot circum-\nscribe what type of notice counts as a \u201cnotice to appear\u201d for\npurposes of the stop-time rule. Brief for Respondent 32. Section\n1229(a), however, does speak in definitional terms, at least with\nrespect to the \u201ctime and place at which the proceedings will be\nheld\u201d: It specifically provides that the notice described under\nparagraph (1) is \u201creferred to as a \u2018notice to appear,\u2019\u00a0\u201d which\nin context is quintessential definitional language.[8] It then defines that term as a \u201cwritten\nnotice\u201d that, as relevant here, \u201cspecif[ies] .\u00a0.\u00a0. [t]he\ntime and place at which the [removal] proceedings will be held.\u201d\n\u00a71229(a)(1)(G)(i). Thus, when the term \u201cnotice to appear\u201d is used\nelsewhere in the statutory section, including as the trigger for\nthe stop-time rule, it carries with it the substantive\ntime-and-place criteria required by \u00a71229(a).Resisting this straightforward understanding of\nthe text, the dissent posits that \u201c\u00a71229(a)(1)\u2019s language can be\nunderstood to define what makes a notice to appearcomplete.\u201dPost, at 10 (emphasis in original). In the\ndissent\u2019s view, a defective notice to appear is still a \u201cnotice to\nappear\u201d even if it is incomplete\u2014much like a three-wheeled Chevy is\nstill a car.Post,at 10\u201311. The statutory text proves\notherwise. Section 1229(a)(1) does not say a \u201cnotice to appear\u201d is\n\u201ccomplete\u201d when it specifies the time and place of the removal\nproceedings. Rather, it defines a \u201cnotice to appear\u201d as a \u201cwritten\nnotice\u201d that \u201cspecif[ies],\u201d at a minimum, the time and place of the\nremoval proceedings. \u00a71229(a)(1)(G)(i). Moreover, the omission of\ntime-and-place information is not, as the dissent asserts, some\ntrivial, ministerial defect, akin to an unsigned notice of appeal.\nCf.Beckerv.Montgomery, 532 U.\u00a0S. 757, 763,\n768 (2001). Failing to specify integral information like the time\nand place of removal proceedings unquestionably would \u201cdeprive [the\nnotice to appear] of its essential character.\u201dPost,at 12,\nn.\u00a05; seesupra,at 12\u201313, n.\u00a07.[9]BThe Government and the dissent next contend\nthat Congress\u2019 use of the word \u201cunder\u201d in the stop-time rule\nrenders the statute ambiguous. Brief for Respondent 22\u201323;post,at 4\u20135. Recall that the stop-time rule provides that\n\u201cany period of .\u00a0.\u00a0. continuous physical presence\u201d is\n\u201cdeemed to end .\u00a0.\u00a0. when the alien is served a notice to\nappear under section 1229(a).\u201d \u00a71229b(d)(1)(A). According to the\nGovernment, the word \u201cunder\u201d in that provision means \u201csubject to,\u201d\n\u201cgoverned by,\u201d or \u201cissued under the authority of.\u201d Brief for\nRespondent 24. The dissent offers yet another alternative,\ninsisting that \u201cunder\u201d can also mean \u201cauthorized by.\u201dPost,at 4. Those definitions, the Government and dissent maintain,\nsupport the BIA\u2019s view that the stop-time rule applies so long as\nDHS serves a notice that is \u201cauthorized by,\u201d or \u201csubject to or\ngoverned by, or issued under the authority of\u201d \u00a71229(a), even if\nthe notice bears none of the time-and-place information required by\nthat provision. See Brief for Respondent 24;post,at\n4\u20135.We disagree. It is, of course, true that \u201c[t]he\nword \u2018under\u2019 is [a] chameleon\u00a0\u201d that \u201c\u00a0\u2018must draw its\nmeaning from its context.\u2019\u00a0\u201dKucanav.Holder,\n558 U.\u00a0S. 233, 245 (2010) (quotingArdestaniv.INS, 502 U.\u00a0S. 129, 135 (1991)). But nothing in the\ntext or context here supports either the Government\u2019s or the\ndissent\u2019s preferred definition of \u201cunder.\u201d Based on the plain\nlanguage and statutory context discussed above, we think it obvious\nthat the word \u201cun-der,\u201d as used in the stop-time rule, can only\nmean \u201cin accordance with\u201d or \u201caccording to,\u201d for it connects the\nstop-time trigger in \u00a71229b(d)(1) to a \u201cnotice to appear\u201d that\ncontains the enumerated time-and-place information described in\n\u00a71229(a)(1)(G)(i). See 18 Oxford English Dictionary 950 (2d ed.\n1989) (defining \u201cunder\u201d as \u201c[i]n accordance with\u201d); Black\u2019s Law\nDictionary 1525 (6th ed. 1990) (defining \u201cunder\u201d as \u201caccording\nto\u201d). So construed, the stop-time rule applies only if the\nGovernment serves a \u201cnotice to appear\u201d \u201c[i]n accordance with\u201d or\n\u201caccording to\u201d the substantive time-and-place requirements set\nforth in \u00a71229(a). SeeKirtsaengv.John Wiley &\nSons, Inc., 568 U.\u00a0S. 519, 530 (2013) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). Far from generating any \u201cdegree of ambiguity,\u201dpost,at 4, the word \u201cunder\u201d provides the glue that bonds\nthe stop-time rule to the substantive time-and-place requirements\nmandated by \u00a71229(a).CThe Government argues that surrounding\nstatutory provisions reinforce its preferred reading. See Brief for\nRespondent 25\u201327. It points, for instance, to two separate\nprovisions relating to in absentia removal orders: \u00a71229a(b)(5)(A),\nwhich provides that a noncitizen may be removed in absentia if the\nGovernment has provided \u201cwritten notice required under paragraph\n(1) or (2) of section 1229(a)\u201d; and \u00a71229a(b)(5)(C)(ii), which\nprovides that, once an in absentia removal order has been entered,\nthe noncitizen may seek to reopen the proceeding if,inter\nalia, he \u201cdemonstrates that [he] did not receive notice in\naccordance with paragraph (1) or (2) of section 1229(a).\u201d According\nto the Government, those two provisions use the distinct phrases\n\u201crequired under\u201d and \u201cin accordance with\u201d as shorthand for a notice\nthat satisfies \u00a71229(a)(1)\u2019s requirements, whereas the stop-time\nrule uses the phrase \u201cunder section 1229(a)\u201d to encompass a\ndifferent type of notice that does not necessarily include the\ninformation outlined in \u00a71229(a)(1). See Brief for Respondent\n25\u201326. That logic is unsound. The Government essentially argues\nthat phrase 1 (\u201cwritten notice required under paragraph (1)\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. of section 1229(a)\u201d) and phrase 2 (\u201cnotice in\naccordance with paragraph (1) .\u00a0.\u00a0. of section 1229(a)\u201d)\ncan refer to the same type of notice even though they use entirely\ndifferent words, but that phrase 3 (\u201cnotice to appear under section\n1229(a)\u201d) cannot refer to that same type of notice because it uses\nwords different from phrases 1 and 2. But the Government offers no\nconvincing reason why that is so. The far simpler explanation, and\nthe one that comports with the actual statutory language and\ncontext, is that each of these three phrases refers to notice\nsatisfying, at a minimum, the time-and-place criteria defined in\n\u00a71229(a)(1).Equally unavailing is the Government\u2019s\ninvocation of \u00a71229a(b)(7). Brief for Respondent 26\u201327. Under that\nprovision, a noncitizen who is ordered removed in absentia is\nineligible for various forms of discretionary relief for a 10-year\nperiod if the noncitizen, \u201cat the time of the notice described in\nparagraph (1) or (2) of section 1229(a) of [Title 8], was provided\noral notice .\u00a0.\u00a0. of the time and place of the\nproceedings\u201d and \u201cof the consequences .\u00a0.\u00a0. of failing,\nother than because of exceptional circumstances,\u201d to appear.\n\u00a71229a(b)(7). The Government argues that the express reference to\n\u201cthe time and place of the proceedings\u201d in \u00a71229a(b)(7) shows that,\nwhen Congress wants to attach substantive significance to whether a\nnoncitizen is given information about the specific \u201ctime and place\u201d\nof a removal proceeding, it knows exactly how to do so. Brief for\nRespondent 26\u201327. But even if \u00a71229a(b)(7) may impose harsher\nconsequences on noncitizens who fail to appear at removal\nproceedings after having specifically received oral notice of the\ntime and place of such proceedings, that reveals nothing about the\ndistinct question here\u2014i.e.,whether Congress intended the\nstop-time rule to apply when the Government fails to provide\nwritten notice of the time and place of removal proceedings. As to\nthat question, the statute makes clear that Congress fully intended\nto attach substantive significance to the requirement that\nnoncitizens be given notice of at least the time and place of their\nremoval proceedings. A document that fails to include such\ninformation is not a \u201cnotice to appear under section 1229(a)\u201d and\nthus does not trigger the stop-time rule.DUnable to find sure footing in the statutory\ntext, the Government and the dissent pivot away from the plain\nlanguage and raise a number of practical concerns. These practical\nconsiderations are meritless and do not justify departing from the\nstatute\u2019s clear text. SeeBurragev.United States,\n571 U.\u00a0S. 204, 218 (2014).The Government, for its part, argues that the\n\u201cadministrative realities of removal proceedings\u201d render it\ndifficult to guarantee each noncitizen a specific time, date, and\nplace for his removal proceedings. See Brief for Respondent 48.\nThat contention rests on the misguided premise that the\ntime-and-place information specified in the notice to appear must\nbe etched in stone. That is incorrect. As noted above, \u00a71229(a)(2)\nexpressly vests the Government with power to change the time or\nplace of a noncitizen\u2019s removal proceedings so long as it provides\n\u201cwritten notice .\u00a0.\u00a0. specifying .\u00a0.\u00a0. the new\ntime or place of the proceedings\u201d and the consequences of failing\nto appear. See \u00a71229(a)(2); Tr. of Oral Arg. 16\u201319. Nothing in our\ndecision today inhibits the Government\u2019s ability to exercise that\nstatu- tory authority after it has served a notice to appear\nspecify- ing the time and place of the removal proceedings.The dissent raises a similar practical concern,\nwhich is similarly misplaced. The dissent worries that requiring\nthe Government to specify the time and place of removal\nproceedings, while allowing the Government to change that\ninformation, might encourage DHS to provide \u201carbitrary dates and\ntimes that are likely to confuse and confound all who receive\nthem.\u201dPost,at 8. The dissent\u2019s argument wrongly assumes\nthat the Government is ut- terly incapable of specifying an\naccurate date and time on a notice to appear and will instead\nengage in \u201carbitrary\u201d behavior. Seeibid.The Court does not\nembrace those unsupported assumptions. As the Government concedes,\n\u201ca scheduling system previously enabled DHS and the immigration\ncourt to coordinate in setting hearing dates in some cases.\u201d Brief\nfor Respondent 50, n.\u00a015; Brief for National Immigrant Justice\nCenter asAmicus Curiae30\u201331. Given today\u2019s advanced\nsoftware capabilities, it is hard to imagine why DHS and\nimmigration courts could not again work together to schedule\nhearings before sending notices to appear.Finally, the dissent\u2019s related contention that\nincluding a changeable date would \u201cmislead\u201d and \u201cprejudice\u201d\nnoncitizens is unfounded.Post,at 8. As already explained,\nif the Government changes the date of the removal proceedings, it\nmust provide written notice to the noncitizen, \u00a71229(a)(2). This\nnotice requirement mitigates any potential confusion that may arise\nfrom altering the hearing date. In reality, it is the dissent\u2019s\ninterpretation of the statute that would \u201cconfuse and confound\u201d\nnoncitizens,post,at 8, by authorizing the Government to\nserve notices that lack any information about the time and place of\nthe removal proceedings.EIn a last ditch effort to salvage its atextual\ninterpretation, the Government invokes the alleged purpose and\nlegislative history of the stop-time rule. Brief for Respondent\n37\u201340. Even for those who consider statutory purpose and\nlegislative history, however, neither supports the Government\u2019s\natextual position that Congress intended the stop-time rule to\napply when a noncitizen has been deprived notice of the time and\nplace of his removal proceedings. By the Government\u2019s own account,\nCongress enacted the stop-time rule to prevent noncitizens from\nexploiting administrative delays to \u201cbuy time\u201d during which they\naccumulate periods of continuous presence.Id.,at 37\u201338\n(citing H.\u00a0R. Rep. No. 104\u2013469, pt. 1, p. 122 (1996)).\nRequiring the Government to furnish time-and-place information in a\nnotice to appear, however, is en- tirely consistent with that\nobjective because, once a proper notice to appear is served, the\nstop-time rule is triggered, and a noncitizen would be unable to\nmanipulate or delay removal proceedings to \u201cbuy time.\u201d At the end\nof the day, given the clarity of the plain language, we \u201capply the\nstatute as it is written.\u201dBurrage, 571 U.\u00a0S., at\n218.IVFor the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the\nCourt of Appeals for the First Circuit is reversed, and the case is\nremanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.Notes1The Court uses the term\n\u201cnoncitizen\u201d throughout this opinion to refer to any person who is\nnot a citizen or national of the United States. See 8\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71101(a)(3).2Lawful permanent\nresidents also may be eligible for cancellation of removal if,inter alia, they have continuously resided in the United\nStates for at least seven years. \u00a71229b(a)(2).3The period of continuous\nphysical presence also stops if and when \u201cthe alien has committed\u201d\ncertain enumerated offenses that would constitute grounds for\nremoval or inadmissibility. \u00a71229b(d)(1)(B). That provision is not\nat issue here.4CompareOrozco-Velasquezv.Attorney General United States,\n817 F.\u00a03d 78, 83\u201384 (CA3 2016) (holding that the stop-time\nrule unambiguously requires service of a \u201cnotice to appear\u201d that\nmeets \u00a71229(a)(1)\u2019s requirements), withMoscoso-Castellanosv.Lynch, 803 F.\u00a03d 1079, 1083 (CA9 2015) (finding the\nstatute ambiguous and deferring to the BIA\u2019s interpretation);O\u2019Garrov.United States Atty.

Contrary to the dissent\u2019s assertion,\nthis exercise of judicial restraint is by no means \u201ctantamount to\nadmitting\u201d that the Government\u2019s (and dissent\u2019s) atextual interpre-\ntation is a permissible construction of the statute.Post,at 10 (opinion of Alito, J.).6The dissent argues that,\nif a notice to appear must furnish time-and-place information, the\nGovernment \u201cmay be forced by the Court\u2019s interpretation to guess\nthat the hearing will take place far in the future, only to learn\nshortly afterwards that the hearing is in fact imminent.\u201dPost,at 14. In such a scenario, the dissent hypothesizes, a\nnoncitizen would be \u201clulled into a false sense of security\u201d and\nthus would have little meaningful opportunity to secure counsel and\nprepare adequately.Ibid.But nothing in our interpretation\nof the statute \u201cforce[s]\u201d the Government to guess when and where a\nhearing will take place,ibid., nor does our interpretation\nprevent DHS and the Immigration Courts from working together to\nstreamline the scheduling of removal proceedings, seeinfra,at 18\u201319. Far from \u201clull[ing]\u201d noncitizens into a false sense of\nsecurity,post, at 14, our reading (unlike the Government\u2019s\nand the dissent\u2019s) still gives meaning to a noncitizen\u2019s\n\u201copportunity to secure counsel before the first [removal] hearing\ndate,\u201d \u00a71229(b)(1), by informing the noncitizen that the Government\nis committed to moving forward with removal proceedings at a\nspecific time and place. Equipped with that knowledge, a noncitizen\nhas an incentive to obtain counsel and prepare for his\nhearing.7At oral argument, the\nGovernment conceded that a blank piece of paper would not suffice\nto trigger the stop-time rule because (in its view) such a\nhypothetical notice would fail to specify the charges against the\nnoncitizen. Tr. of Oral Arg. 39\u201340 (arguing that notice to appear\nmust \u201ctell the alien what proceedings he must appear for and why he\nmust appear for them\u201d). The dissent also endorses the view that a\nnotice to appear \u201ccan also be understood to serve primarily as a\ncharging document.\u201dPost,at 14\u201315. But neither the\nGovernment nor the dissent offers any convincing basis, much less\none rooted in the statutory text, for treating time-and-place\ninformation as any less crucial than charging information for\npurposes of triggering the stop-time rule. Furthermore, there is no\nreason why a notice to appear should have only one essential\nfunction. Even if a notice to appear functions as a \u201ccharging\ndocument,\u201d that is not mutually exclusive with the conclusion that\na notice to appear serves another equally integral function:\ntelling a noncitizen when and where to appear. At bottom, the\nGovernment\u2019s self-serving position that a notice to appear must\nspecify charging information, but not the time-and-place\ninformation, reveals the arbitrariness inherent in its atextual\napproach to the stop-time rule.8Congress has employed\nsimilar definitional language in other statutory schemes. See,e.g.,21 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7356(b)(1) (creating new class\nof \u201cfast track product[s]\u201d by setting out drug requirements and\nproviding: \u201cIn this section, such a drug is referred to as a \u2018fast\ntrack product\u2019\u00a0\u201d); \u00a7356(a)(1) (\u201cIn this section, such a drug\nis referred to as a \u2018breakthrough therapy\u2019\u00a0\u201d); 38\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a77451(a)(2) (\u201chereinafter in this section\nreferred to as \u2018covered positions\u2019\u00a0\u201d); 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7285g\u20134(b) (\u201chereafter in this section referred to as \u2018medical\nrehabilitation\u2019\u00a0\u201d).9The dissent maintains\nthat Congress\u2019 decision to make the stop-time rule retroactive to\ncertain pre-IIRIRA \u201corders to show cause\u201d \u201csheds considerable light\non the question presented\u201d because orders to show cause did not\nnecessarily include time-and-place information.Post,at\n6\u20137. That argument compares apples to oranges. Even if the\nstop-time rule sometimes applies retroactively to an order to show\ncause, that provides scant support for the dissent\u2019s view that,\nunder the new post-IIRIRA statutory regime, an entirely different\ndocument called a \u201cnotice to appear,\u201d which, by statute, must\nspecify the time and place of removal proceedings, see\n\u00a71229(a)(1)(G)(i), need not include such information to trigger the\nstop-time rule.",
