S. ____ (2007)SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESNO. 05-705GLOBAL CROSSING TELECOMMUNICATIONS, INC.,\nPETITIONERv.METROPHONES TELE- COMMUNICATIONS, INC.on writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the ninth circuit[April 17, 2007]Justice Thomas, dissenting.The Court holds that failure to\npay a payphone operator for coinless calls is an \u201cunjust or\nunreasonable\u201d \u201cpractice\u201d under 47 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7201(b). Properly\nunderstood, however, \u00a7201 does not reach the conduct at issue here.\nFailing to pay is not a \u201cpractice\u201d under \u00a7201 because that section\nregulates the activities of telecommunications firms in their role\nasprovidersof telecommunications services. As such,\n\u00a7201(b) does not reach the behavior of telecommunication firms in\nother aspects of their business. I respectfully dissent.IThe meaning of \u00a7201(b) of the\nCommunications Act of 1934 becomes clear when read, as it should\nbe, as a part of the entirety of \u00a7201. Subsection (a) sets out the\nduties and broad discretionary powers of a common carrier:\u201cIt shall be the duty of every common carrier\nengaged in interstate or foreign communication by wire or radio to\nfurnish such communication service upon reasonable request\ntherefor; and \u2026 to establish physical connections with other\ncarriers, to establish through routes and charges applicable\nthereto and the divisions of such charges, and to establish and\nprovide facilities and regulations for operating such through\nroutes.\u201dImmediately following that description of duties\nand powers, subsection (b) requires:\u201cAll charges, practices, classifications, and\nregulations for and in connection with such communication service,\nshall be just and reasonable, and any such charge, practice,\nclassification, or regulation that is unjust or unreasonable is\ndeclared to be unlawful\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dThe \u201ccharges, practices, classifications, and\nregulations\u201d referred to in subsection (b) are those\n\u201cestablish[ed]\u201d under subsection (a). Having given common carriers\ndiscretionary power to set charges and establish regulations in\nsubsection (a), Congress required in subsection (b) that the\nexercise of this power be \u201cjust and reasonable.\u201d Thus, unless\nfailing to pay a payphone operator arises from one of the duties\nunder subsection (a), it is not a \u201cpractice\u201d within the meaning of\nsubsection (b).Subsection (a) prescribes a carrier\u2019s duty to\nrender service either to customers (\u201cfurnish[ing] \u2026 communication\nservice\u201d) or to other carriers (e.g., \u201cestablish[ing]\nphysical connections\u201d); it does not set out duties related to the\nreceipt of service from suppliers. Consequently, given the\nrelationship between subsections (a) and (b), subsection (b) covers\nonly those \u201cpractices\u201d connected with theprovisionof\nservice to customers or other carriers. The Court embraced this\ncritical limitation inMissouri Pacific R.\u00a0Co.v.Norwood,283 U. S. 249(1931),\nwhich held that the term \u201cpractice\u201d means a \u201c\u00a0\u2018practice\u2019 in\nconnection with the fixing of rates to be charged and prescribing\nof service to be rendered by the carriers.\u201dId.,at 257.\nInNorwood, the Court interpreted language from the\nInterstate Commerce Act (as amended by the Mann-Elkins Act) that\nCongress just three years later copied into the Communications Act.Ante, at 3; see \u00a77 of the Mann-Elkins Act of 1910, 36\nStat. 546. In passing the Communications Act, Congress may \u201cbe\npresumed to have had knowledge\u201d and to have approved of the Court\u2019s\ninterpretation inNorwood.SeeLorillardv.Pons,434\nU. S. 575, 581 (1978). As a result, the Supreme Court\u2019s\ncontemporaneous interpretation of \u201cpractice\u201d should bear heavily on\nour analysis.Other terms in \u00a7201 support usingNorwood\u2019s restrictive interpretation of \u201cpractice.\u201d A word\n\u201cis known by the company it keeps,\u201d and one should not \u201cascrib[e]\nto one word a meaning so broad that it is inconsistent with its\naccompanying words.\u201dGustafsonv.Alloyd Co.,513 U. S. 561,\n575 (1995). Of the quartet \u201ccharges, practices, classifications,\nand regulations,\u201d the terms \u201ccharges,\u201d \u201cclassifications,\u201d and\n\u201cregulations\u201d could apply only to the party \u201cfurnish[ing]\u201d service.\n\u201c[C]harges\u201d refers to the charges for physical connections and\nthrough routes. 47 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a7201(a), 202(b). \u201c[R]egulations\u201d\nrelates to the operation of through routes. \u00a7201(a).\n\u201c[C]lassifications\u201d refers to different sorts of communications\nthat carry different charges. \u00a7201(b). These three terms involve\neither setting rules for the provision of service or setting rates\nfor that provision. In keeping with the meaning of these terms, the\nterm \u201cpractices\u201d must refer to only those practices \u201cin connection\nwith the fixing of rates to be charged and prescribing of service\nto be rendered by the carriers.\u201dNorwood,supra,at 257.The statutory provisions surrounding \u00a7201\nconfirm this interpretation. Section 203 requires that \u201c[e]very\ncommon carrier \u2026 shall \u2026 file with the Commission \u2026 schedules\nshowing all charges for itself and its connecting carriers \u2026 and\nshowing the classifications, practices, and regulations affecting\nsuch charges.\u201d See also \u00a7\u00a7204\u2013205 (also using the phrase \u201ccharge,\nclassification, regulation, or practice\u201d in the tariff context).\nThe \u201ccharges\u201d referred to are those related to a carrier\u2019s own\nservices. \u00a7203 (\u201ccharges for itself and its connecting carriers\u201d).\nThe \u201cclassifications, practices, and regulations\u201d are also limited\nto a carrier\u2019s own services.Ibid.(applying only to\npractices \u201caffecting such charges\u201d). In this context, \u201cpractices\u201d\nmust mean only those \u201cin connection with the fixing of rates to be\ncharged.\u201dNorwood, 283 U. S., at 257. Section 202\u2014outside\nof the tariff context\u2014also supports this limitation. It forbids\ndiscrimination \u201cin charges, practices, classifications,\nregulations, facilities, or services.\u201d Discrimination occurs with\nrespect to a carrier\u2019s provision of service\u2014not its purchasing of\nservices from others. I am unaware of any context in which\n\u00a7\u00a7202\u2013205 were applied to conduct relating to the service that\nanother party provided to a telecommunications carrier.In this case, Global Crossing has not provided\nany service to Metrophones. Rather, Global Crossing has failed to\npay for a service that Metrophones supplied. The failure to pay a\nsupplier is not in any sense a \u201c\u00a0\u2018practice\u2019 in connection with\nthe fixing of rates to be charged and prescribing of service to be\nrendered by the carriers.\u201dId.,at 257. Accordingly,\nGlobal Crossing has not engaged in a practice under subsection (b)\nbecause the failure to pay has not come in connection with its\nprovision of service or setting of rates within the meaning of\nsubsection (a). On this understanding of \u00a7201, Global Crossing\u2019s\nfailure to pay Metrophones is not a statutory violation. All that\nremains is a regulatory violation, which does not provide\nMetrophones a private right of action under \u00a7207.[Footnote 1]IIThe majority suggests that\ndeference underChevron U. S.\u00a0A. Inc.v.Natural\nResources Defense Council, Inc.,467 U. S. 837(1984),\ncompels its conclusion that a carrier\u2019s refusal to pay a payphone\noperator is unreasonable. But \u201cunjust or unreasonable\u201d is a\nstatutory term, \u00a7201(b), and a court may not, in the name of\ndeference, abdicate its responsibility to interpret a statute.\nUnderChevron, an agency is due no deference until the\ncourt analyzes the statute and determines that Congress did not\nspeak directly to the issue under consideration:\u201cThe judiciary is the final authority on issues of\nstatutory construction and must reject administrative constructions\nwhich are contrary to clear congressional intent. \u2026 If a court,\nemploying traditional tools of statutory construction, ascertains\nthat Congress had an intention on the precise question at issue,\nthat intention is the law and must be given effect.\u201dId.,at 843, n.\u00a09.The majority spends one short\nparagraph analyzing the relevant provisions of the Communications\nAct to determine whether a refusal to pay is an \u201c\u00a0\u2018unjust or\nunreasonable\u2019\u00a0\u201d \u201c\u00a0\u2018practice.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAnte, at 7.\nIts entire statutory analysis is essentially encompassed in a\nsingle sentence in that paragraph: \u201cThat is to say, in ordinary\nEnglish, one can call a refusal to pay Commission-ordered\ncompensation despite having received a benefit from the payphone\noperator a \u2018practice \u2026 in connection with [furnishing a]\ncommunication service \u2026 that is \u2026 unreasonable.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIbid.(omissions and modifications in original). This\nanalysis ignores the interaction between \u00a7201(a) and \u00a7201(b),supra,at 1\u20132; it ignores the three terms surrounding the\nword \u201cpractice\u201d and the context those terms provide,supra,at 3\u20134; it ignores the use of the term \u201cpractice\u201d\nin nearby statutory provisions, such as \u00a7\u00a7202\u2013205,supra,at 4; and it ignores the understanding of the term \u201cpractice\u201d at\nthe time Congress enacted the Communications Act,supra,at 2\u20133.After breezing by the text of the statutory\nprovisions at issue, the majority cites lower court cases to claim\nthat \u201cthe underlying regulated activity at issue hereresemblesactivity that both transportation and\ncommunications agencies have long regulated.\u201dAnte, at 7\u20138\n(citingAllnet Communication Serv., Inc.v.National\nExch. Carrier Assn., Inc., 965 F.\u00a02d 1118 (CADC 1992),\nandSouthwestern Bell Tel. Co.v.Allnet\nCommunications Serv., Inc.,789 F.\u00a0Supp. 302 (ED Mo.\n1992)). It argues that these cases demonstrate that \u201ccommunications\nfirms entitled to revenues under rate divisions or cost allocations\nmight bring lawsuits under \u00a7207 \u2026 and obtain compensation or\ndamages.\u201dAnte, at 8. But in both cases, the only issue\nbefore the court was whether the lawsuit should be dismissed\nbecause the FCC had primary jurisdiction; and in both cases, the\nanswer was yes.Allnet,supra, at 1120\u20131123;Southwestern Bell,supra, at 304\u2013306. The Court\u2019s\nreliance on these cases is thus entirely misplaced because both\ncourts found they lacked jurisdiction; the cases do not address\n\u00a7201 at all\u2014the interpretation of which is the sole question in\nthis case; and both cases assume without deciding that \u00a7207\napplies, thus not grappling with the point for which the majority\nclaims their support.[Footnote\n2]IIIFinally, independent of the FCC\u2019s\ninterpretation of the language \u201cunjust or unreasonable\u201d \u201cpractice,\u201d\nthe FCC\u2019s interpretation is unreasonable because it regulates both\ninterstate and intrastate calls. The unjust-and-unreasonable\nrequirement of \u00a7201(b) applies only to \u201cpractices \u2026 in connection\nwith such communication service,\u201d and the term \u201csuch communication\nservice\u201d refers to \u201cinterstateor foreign communication by\nwire or radio\u201d in \u00a7201(a) (emphasis added). Disregarding this\nlimitation, the FCC has applied its rule to both interstate and\nintrastate calls. 47 CFR \u00a764.1300 (2005). In light of the fact that\nthe statute explicitly limits \u201cunjust or unreasonable\u201d \u201cpractices\u201d\nto those involving \u201cinterstate or foreign communication,\u201d the FCC\u2019s\napplication of \u00a7201(b) to intrastate calls is plainly an\nunreasonable interpretation of the statute. To make matters worse,\nthe FCC has not even bothered to explain its clear\nmisinterpretation. SeeIn re Pay Telephone Reclassification and\nCompensation Provisions of the Telecommunications Act of 1996,\n18 FCC Rcd. 19975 (2003).The majority avoids directly\naddressing this argument by stating there is no reason \u201cto forbid\nthe FCC from concluding that an interstate half loaf is better than\nnone.\u201dAnte, at 13. But if the FCC\u2019s rule is unreasonable,\nMetrophones should not be able to recover for intrastate calls in a\nsuit under \u00a7207. Because intrastate calls cannot be the subject of\nan \u201cunjust or unreasonable\u201d practice under \u00a7201, there is no\nprivate right of action to recover for them, and the Court should\ncut off that half of the loaf. By sidestepping this issue, the\nmajority gives the lower court no guidance about how to handle\nintrastate calls on remand.IVBecause the majority allows the\nFCC to interpret the Communications Act in a way that contradicts\nthe unambiguous text, I respectfully dissent.Footnote 1Other enforcement mechanisms exist to redress\nGlobal Crossing\u2019s failure to pay. The Federal Communications\nCommission (FCC) has the power to impose fines under 47 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a7503(b)(1)(B) and (2)(B). In addition, the FCC may have\nthe authority to create an administrative right of action under\n\u00a7276(b)(1) (giving the FCC power to \u201ctake all actions necessary\u201d to\n\u201cestablish a per call compensation plan\u201d that ensures \u201call payphone\nservice providers are fairly compensated\u201d).Footnote 2The majority\u2019s citation toChicago &\nNorth Western Transp. Co.v.Atchison,T.\u00a0&\u00a0S.\u00a0F.\u00a0R. Co.,609 F.\u00a02d\n1221 (CA7 1979), is similarly misplaced. There, the Court of\nAppeals interpreted the meaning of the statutory requirement to\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018establish just, reasonable, and equitable divisions\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nunder the Interstate Commerce Act.Id.,at 1224. It is\ndifficult to understand why the Seventh Circuit\u2019s interpretation of\ndifferent statutory language is relevant to the question we face in\nthis case.",
