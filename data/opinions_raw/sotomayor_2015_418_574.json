The party who first uses a mark in commerce\nis said to have priority over other users. Recognizing that\ntrademark users ought to be permitted to make certain modifications\nto their marks over time without losing priority, lower courts have\nprovided that, in limited circumstances, a party may clothe a new\nmark with the priority position of an older mark. This doctrine is\ncalled \u201ctacking,\u201d and lower courts have found tacking to be\navailable when the original and revised marks are \u201clegal\nequivalents\u201d in that they create the same, continuing commercial\nimpression. The question presented here is whether a judge or a\njury should determine whether tacking is available in a given case.\nBecause the tacking inquiry operates from the perspective of an\nordinary purchaser or consumer, we hold that a jury should make\nthis determination.IPetitioner, Hana Financial, and respondent Hana Bank, a\nsubsidiary of respondent Hana Financial Group, both provide\nfinancial services to individuals in the United States. Hana Bank\n(hereinafter respondent) was established in 1971 as a Korean entity\ncalled Korea Investment Finance Corporation. In 1991, that entity\nchanged its name to \u201cHana Bank\u201d and began using this name in Korea.\nIn 1994, it established a service called Hana Overseas Korean Club\nto provide financial services to Korean expatriates, and\nspecifically advertised that service in the United States. Those\nadvertisements used the name \u201cHana Overseas Korean Club\u201d in both\nEnglish and Korean, and included the name \u201cHana Bank\u201d in Korean and\nrespondent\u2019s \u201cdancing man\u201d logo. See App. 206. In 2000, respondent\nchanged the name of the Hana Overseas Ko-rean Club to \u201cHana World\nCenter.\u201d In 2002, respondent began operating a bank in the United\nStates under the name \u201cHana Bank.\u201d This enterprise amounted to\nrespondent\u2019s first physical presence in the United States.Petitioner was established in 1994 as a California corporation\ncalled Hana Financial. It began using that name and an associated\ntrademark in commerce in 1995. In 1996, it obtained a federal\ntrademark registration for a pyramid logo with the name \u201cHana\nFinancial\u201d for use in connection with financial services.In 2007, petitioner sued respondent, alleging infringement of\nits \u201cHana Financial\u201d mark. As relevant here, respondent denied\ninfringement by invoking the tacking doctrine and claiming that it\nhad priority. The District Court initially granted summary judgment\nto respondent on the infringement claim, but the Court of Appeals\nfor the Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that there were genuine\nissues of material fact as to priority. On remand, the infringement\nclaim was tried before a jury. The District Court adopted in\nsubstantial part the jury instruction proposed by petitioner, and,\nwithout objection from petitioner, instructed the jury as\nfollows:\u201cA party may claim priority in a mark based on the first use\ndate of a similar but technically distinct mark where the\npreviously used mark is the legal equivalent of the mark in\nquestion or indistinguish-able therefrom such that consumers\nconsider both as the same mark. This is called \u2018tacking.\u2019 The marks\nmust create the same, continuing commercial impression, and the\nlater mark should not materially differ from or alter the character\nof the mark attemptedto be tacked.\u201d App. 173; seeid.,at\n140 (proposedinstruction).The jury returned a verdict in favor of respondent, and the\nDistrict Court denied petitioner\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter\nof law.The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed. The court\nexplained that, although tacking applies only in \u201cexceptionally\nnarrow circumstances,\u201d 735 F.\u00a03d 1158, 1160 (2013) (internal\nquotation marks omitted), it \u201c\u00a0\u2018requires a highly\nfact-sensitive inquiry\u2019\u00a0\u201d that is \u201creserved for the jury,\u201dibid.(quotingOne Industries, LLCv.Jim O\u2019Neal\nDistributing, Inc., 578 F.\u00a03d 1154, 1160 (CA9 2009)). The\ncourt acknowledged, however, that whether tacking should be decided\nby juries or judges \u201cis the subject of a circuit split.\u201d 735\nF.\u00a03d, at 1164, n.\u00a05 (noting that the Federal and Sixth\nCircuits \u201cevaluate tacking as a question of law\u201d); seeVan\nDyne-Crotty, Inc.v.Wear-Guard Corp., 926 F.\u00a02d\n1156, 1159 (CA Fed. 1991);Data Concepts, Inc.v.Digital\nConsulting, Inc., 150 F.\u00a03d 620, 623 (CA6 1998).We granted certiorari, 573 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2014), and now\naffirm.IIAs discussed above, the general rule adopted by lower courts has\nbeen that two marks may be tacked when the original and revised\nmarks are \u201clegal equivalents.\u201d This term refers to two marks that\n\u201ccreate the same, continuing commercial impression\u201d so that\nconsumers \u201cconsider both as the same mark.\u201d[1]Van Dyne-Crotty, Inc., 926 F.\u00a02d, at 1159 (internal\nquotation marks omitted); see,e.g.,George & Co.,\nLLCv.Imagination Entertainment Ltd., 575 F. 3d 383,\n402 (CA4 2009);Brookfield Communications, Inc.v.West\nCoast Entertainment Corp., 174 F. 3d 1036, 1047\u20131048 (CA9\n1999);Data Concepts, Inc., 150 F.\u00a03d, at 623. \u201cThe\ncommercial impression that a mark conveys must be viewed through\nthe eyes of a consumer.\u201dDuoProSS Medi-tech Corp.v.Inviro Medical Devices, Ltd., 695 F. 3d 1247, 1253 (CA Fed.\n2012); see 3 J. McCarthy, Trademarks and Unfair Competition \u00a717:26,\np. 17\u201371 (4th ed. 2014) (\u201c\u00a0\u2018Commercial impression,\u2019 like most\nissues in trademark law, should be determined from the perspective\nof the ordinary purchaser of these kinds of goods or\nservices\u201d).Application of a test that relies upon an ordinary consumer\u2019s\nunderstanding of the impression that a mark conveys falls\ncomfortably within the ken of a jury. Indeed, we have long\nrecognized across a variety of doctrinal contexts that, when the\nrelevant question is how an ordinary person or community would make\nan assessment, the jury is generally the decisionmaker that ought\nto provide the fact-intensive answer. See,e.g., United\nStatesv.Gaudin,515 U.\u00a0S. 506,512 (1995)\n(recognizing that \u201c\u00a0\u2018delicate assessments of the inferences a\n\u2018reasonable [decisionmaker]\u2019 would draw . . . [are] peculiarly\none[s] for the trier of fact\u2019\u00a0\u201d (quotingTSC Industries,\nInc.v.Northway, Inc.,426 U.\u00a0S. 438,450 (1976);\nfirst alteration in original);id.,at 450, n.\u00a012\n(observing that the jury has a \u201cunique competence in applying the\n\u2018reasonable man\u2019 standard\u201d);Hamlingv.United\nStates,418 U. S. 87\u2013105 (1974) (emphasizing \u201cthe ability of the\njuror to ascertain the sense of the \u2018average person\u2019\u00a0\u201d by\ndrawing upon \u201chis own knowledge of the views of the average person\nin thecommunity or vicinage from which he comes\u201d and his \u201cknowledge\nof the propensities of a \u2018reasonable\u2019 person\u201d);Railroad Co.v.Stout, 17 Wall. 657, 664 (1874) (\u201cIt is assumed that\ntwelve men know more of the common affairs of life than does one\nman, [and] that they can draw wiser and safer conclusions from\nadmitted facts thus occurring than can a single judge\u201d).This is certainly not to say that a judge may never determine\nwhether two marks may be tacked. If the facts warrant it, a judge\nmay decide a tacking question on a motion for summary judgment or\nfor judgment as a matter of law. See Fed. Rules Civ. Proc. 50,\n56(a). And if the parties have opted to try their case before a\njudge, the judge may of course decide a tacking question in his or\nher factfinding capacity. We hold only that, when a jury trial has\nbeen requested and when the facts do not warrant entry of summary\njudgment or judgment as a matter of law, the question whether\ntacking is warranted must be decided by a jury.IIIAttempting to overcome our conclusion, petitioner offers four\nreasons why, in its view, tacking is a question of law that should\nbe resolved by a judge. None persuades us.Petitioner first observes that the \u201clegal equivalents\u201d test\ninvolves the application of a legal standard. See Brief for\nPetitioner 20. True enough, but \u201cthe\napplication-of-legal-standard-to-fact sort of question . . . ,\ncommonly called a \u2018mixed question of law and fact,\u2019 has typically\nbeen resolved by juries.\u201dGaudin, 515 U. S., at 512; seeid., at 514 (\u201c[T]he jury\u2019s constitutional responsibility is\nnot merely to determine the facts, but to apply the law to those\nfacts and draw the ultimate conclusion . . .\u201d);Millerv.Fenton,474 U. S. 104,113 (1985) (\u201c[A]n issue does not lose\nits factual character merely because its resolution is dispositive\nof the ultimate . . . question\u201d). The \u201cmixed\u201d analysis that takes\nplace during the tacking inquiry is no different. And insofar as\npetitioner is concerned that a jury may improperly apply the\nrelevant legal standard, the solution is to craft careful jury\ninstructions that make that standard clear. Here, however,\npetitioner can hardly criticize the instruction the District Court\ngave the jury, as it was essentially the instruction petitioner\nproposed.Second, petitioner argues that tacking determinations will\n\u201ccreate new law that will guide future tacking disputes\u201d\u2014a task\nreserved for judges. Brief for Petitioner 21. It is not at all\nclear, however, why a tacking determination in a particular case\nwill \u201ccreate new law\u201d any more than will a jury verdict in a tort\ncase, a contract dispute, or a criminal proceeding. Petitioner\ninsists that tacking questions \u201chave to be\u201d resolved by comparing\ntwo marks in a given case \u201cagainst those addressed in other tacking\ncases,\u201did.,at 22, but we do not agree. Of course, in\ndeciding summary judgment motions, or in making rulings in bench\ntrials, judges may look to past cases holding that trademark owners\neither were or were not entitled to tacking as a matter of law. But\npetitioner offers no support for the claim that tacking cases \u201chave\nto be\u201d resolved by reliance on precedent. Indeed, in many of the\ncases petitioner cites in support of this argument, the courts in\nquestion relied on precedent only to define the relevant legal\nstandard. See,e.g.,Spechtv.Google Inc.,\n758 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d 570, 583\u2013585 (ND Ill. 2010), aff\u2019d, 747\nF.\u00a03d 929 (CA7 2014);Children\u2019s Legal Servs. PLLCv.Kresch, 2008 WL 1901245, *1\u2013*2 (ED Mich., Apr. 25, 2008),\naff\u00a0\u2019dsub\u00a0nom. Children\u2019s Legal Servs., P. L. L.\nC.v.Saiontz, Kirk & Miles, P. A., 2009 WL 1868809\n(CA6, June 18, 2009).[2]Third, and related, petitioner worries that the predict-ability\nrequired for a functioning trademark system will be absent if\ntacking questions are assigned to juries. See Brief for Petitioner\n25\u201327. But, again, the same could be said about the tort, contract,\nand criminal justice systems: In all of these areas, juries answer\noften-dispositive fac-tual questions or make dispositive\napplications of legal standards to facts. The fact that another\njury, hearing the same case, might reach a different conclusion may\nmake the system \u201cunpredictable,\u201d but it has never stopped us from\nemploying juries in these analogous contexts. Petitioner has\noffered no reason why trademark tacking ought to be treated\ndifferently. Moreover, decisionmaking in fact-intensive disputes\nnecessarily requires judgment calls. Regardless of whether those\njudgment calls are made by juries or judges, they necessarily\ninvolve some degree of uncertainty, particularly when they have to\ndo with how reasonable persons would behave.Finally, petitioner argues that, as a historical matter, judges\nhave resolved tacking disputes. See Brief for Petitioner 30\u201335. But\npetitioner relies on cases in which judges have resolved tacking\ndisputes in bench trials, at summary judgment, or the like. See,e.g.,Drexel Enterprises, Inc.v.Richardson,\n312 F.\u00a02d 525, 526 (CA10 1962) (\u201c[This action] was tried\nwithout a jury\u201d);Perfectform Corp.v.Perfect Brassiere\nCo., 256 F.\u00a02d 736, 738 (CA3 1958) (\u201cThe district court\ndismissed the complaint\u201d);John Morrell & Co.v.Hauser Packing Co., 20 F.\u00a02d 713 (CA9 1927) (\u201cIn the\ncourt below, there was a dismissal of both the bill and of\ndefendant\u2019s counterclaim\u201d);Beech-Nut Packing Co.v.P.\nLorillard Co., 299 F. 834, 835 (NJ 1924) (equitable claims\ntried solely before a judge). As we have noted, it is undisputed\nthat judges may resolve tacking disputes in those contexts. But\nrecognizing as much does not gainsay our conclusion that, when a\njury is to be empaneled and when the facts warrant neither summary\njudgment nor judgment as a matter of law, tacking is a question for\nthe jury.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*The Ninth Circuit correctly held that whether two marks may be\ntacked for purposes of determining priority is a question for the\njury. Accordingly, the judgment of the Ninth Circuit is\naffirmed.It is so ordered.Notes1The parties do not question the\nexistence of the tacking doctrine or this substantive\nstandard.2Our decision inMarkmanv.Westview Instruments, Inc.,517 U.\u00a0S. 370 (1996), is not\nto the contrary. InMarkman, we held that the task of\nconstruing patent terms falls to judges and not to juries. We held\nas much because \u201c[t]he construction of written instruments is one\nof those things that judges often do and are likely to do better\nthan jurors unburdened by training in exegesis.\u201dId.,at\n388; seeTeva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc.,v.Sandoz,\nInc.,ante, at 5. The tacking inquiry, by contrast,\ninvolves a factual judgment about whether two marks give the same\nimpression to consumers. Making that kind of judgment is, as\ndiscussed above, not \u201cone of those things that judges often do\u201d\nbetter than jurors.",
