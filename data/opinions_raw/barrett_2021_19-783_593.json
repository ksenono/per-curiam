Van Buren\u2019s conduct plainly flouted his\ndepartment\u2019s policy, which authorized him to obtain database\ninformation only for law enforcement purposes. We must decide\nwhether Van Buren also violated the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of\n1986 (CFAA), which makes it illegal \u201cto access a computer with\nauthorization and to use such access to obtain or alter information\nin the computer that the accesser is not entitled so to obtain or\nalter.\u201dHe did not. This provision covers those who\nobtain information from particular areas in the computer\u2014such as\nfiles, folders, or databases\u2014to which their computer access does\nnot extend. It does not cover those who, like Van Buren, have\nimproper motives for obtaining information that is otherwise\navailable to them.IATechnological advances at the dawn of the\n1980s brought computers to schools, offices, and homes across the\nNation. But as the public and private sectors harnessed the power\nof computing for improvement and innovation, so-called hackers\nhatched ways to coopt computers for illegal ends. After a series of\nhighly publicized hackings captured the public\u2019s attention, it\nbecame clear that traditional theft and trespass statutes were ill\nsuited to address cybercrimes that did not deprive computer owners\nof property in the traditional sense. See Kerr, Cybercrime\u2019s Scope:\nInterpreting \u201cAccess\u201d and \u201cAuthorization\u201d in Computer Misuse\nStatutes, 78 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 1596, 1605\u20131613 (2003).Congress, following the lead of several States,\nresponded by enacting the first federal computer-crime statute as\npart of the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984. \u00a72102(a),\n98Stat. 2190\u20132192. A few years later, Congress passed the CFAA,\nwhich included the provisions at issue in this case. The Act\nsubjects to criminal liability anyone who \u201cintentionally accesses a\ncomputer without authorization or exceeds authorized access,\u201d and\nthereby obtains computer information. 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a71030(a)(2). It defines the term \u201cexceeds authorized access\u201d to\nmean \u201cto access a computer with authorization and to use such\naccess to obtain or alter information in the computer that the\naccesser is not entitled so to obtain or alter.\u201d \u00a71030(e)(6).Initially, subsection (a)(2)\u2019s prohibition\nbarred accessing only certain financial information. It has since\nexpanded to cover any information from any computer \u201cused in or\naffecting interstate or foreign commerce or communication.\u201d\n\u00a71030(e)(2)(B). As a result, the prohibition now applies\u2014at a\nminimum\u2014to all information from all computers that connect to the\nInternet. \u00a7\u00a71030(a)(2)(C), (e)(2)(B).Those who violate \u00a71030(a)(2) face penalties\nranging from fines and misdemeanor sentences to imprisonment for up\nto 10 years. \u00a71030(c)(2). They also risk civil liability under the\nCFAA\u2019s private cause of action, which allows persons suffering\n\u201cdamage\u201d or \u201closs\u201d from CFAA violations to sue for money damages\nand equitable relief. \u00a71030(g).BThis case stems from Van Buren\u2019s time as a\npolice sergeant in Georgia. In the course of his duties, Van Buren\ncrossed paths with a man named Andrew Albo. The deputy chief of Van\nBuren\u2019s department considered Albo to be \u201cvery volatile\u201d and warned\nofficers in the department to deal with him carefully.\nNotwithstanding that warning, Van Buren developed a friendly\nrelationship with Albo. Or so Van Buren thought when he went to\nAlbo to ask for a personal loan. Unbeknownst to Van Buren, Albo\nsecretly recorded that request and took it to the local\nsheriff\u00a0\u2019s office, where he complained that Van Buren had\nsought to \u201cshake him down\u201d for cash.The taped conversation made its way to the\nFederal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), which devised an operation\nto see how far Van Buren would go for money. The steps were\nstraightforward: Albo would ask Van Buren to search the state law\nenforcement computer database for a license plate purportedly\nbelonging to a woman whom Albo had met at a local strip club. Albo,\nno stranger to legal troubles, would tell Van Buren that he wanted\nto ensure that the woman was not in fact an undercover officer. In\nreturn for the search, Albo would pay Van Buren around $5,000.Things went according to plan. Van Buren used\nhis patrol-car computer to access the law enforcement database with\nhis valid credentials. He searched the database for the license\nplate that Albo had provided. After obtaining the FBI-created\nlicense-plate entry, Van Buren told Albo that he had information to\nshare.The Federal Government then charged Van Buren\nwith a felony violation of the CFAA on the ground that running the\nlicense plate for Albo violated the \u201cexceeds authorized access\u201d\nclause of 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71030(a)(2).[1] The trial evidence showed that Van Buren had\nbeen trained not to use the law enforcement database for \u201can\nimproper purpose,\u201d defined as \u201cany personal use.\u201d App. 17. Van\nBuren therefore knew that the search breached department policy.\nAnd according to the Government, that violation of department\npolicy also violated the CFAA. Consistent with that position, the\nGovernment told the jury that Van Buren\u2019s access of the database\n\u201cfor a non[-\u00a0]law[-]enforcement purpose\u201d violated the CFAA\n\u201cconcept\u201d against \u201cusing\u201d a computer network in a way contrary to\n\u201cwhat your job or policy prohibits.\u201dId.,at 39. The jury\nconvicted Van Buren, and the District Court sentenced him to 18\nmonths in prison.Van Buren appealed to the Eleventh Circuit,\narguing that the \u201cexceeds authorized access\u201d clause applies only to\nthose who obtain information to which their computer access does\nnot extend, not to those who misuse access that they otherwise\nhave. While several Circuits see the clause Van Buren\u2019s way, the\nEleventh Circuit is among those that have taken a broader\nview.[2] Consistent with its\nCircuit precedent, the panel held that Van Buren had violated the\nCFAA by accessing the law enforcement database for an\n\u201cinappropriate reason.\u201d 940 F.3d 1192, 1208 (2019). We granted\ncertiorari to resolve the split in authority regarding the scope of\nliability under the CFAA\u2019s \u201cexceeds authorized access\u201d clause. 590\nU.\u00a0S. ___ (2020).IIA1Both Van Buren and the Government raise a host\nof policy arguments to support their respective interpretations.\nBut we start where we always do: with the text of the statute.\nHere, the most relevant text is the phrase \u201cexceeds authorized\naccess,\u201d which means \u201cto access a computer with authorization and\nto use such access to obtain .\u00a0.\u00a0. information in the\ncomputer that the accesser is not entitled so to obtain.\u201d\n\u00a71030(e)(6).The parties agree that Van Buren \u201caccess[ed] a\ncomputer with authorization\u201d when he used his patrol-car computer\nand valid credentials to log into the law enforcement database.\nThey also agree that Van Buren \u201cobtain[ed] .\u00a0.\u00a0.\ninformation in the computer\u201d when he acquired the license-plate\nrecord for Albo. The dispute is whether Van Buren was \u201centitled so\nto obtain\u201d the record.\u201cEntitle\u201d means \u201cto give .\u00a0.\u00a0. a\ntitle, right, or claim to something.\u201d Random House Dictionary of\nthe English Language 649 (2d ed. 1987). See also Black\u2019s Law\nDictionary 477 (5th ed. 1979) (\u201cto give a right or legal title\nto\u201d). The parties agree that Van Buren had been given the right to\nacquire license-plate information\u2014that is, he was \u201centitled to\nobtain\u201d it\u2014from the law enforcement computer database. But was Van\nBuren \u201centitledsoto obtain\u201d the license-plate information,\nas the statute requires?Van Buren says yes. He notes that \u201cso,\u201d as used\nin this statute, serves as a term of reference that recalls \u201cthe\nsame manner as has been stated\u201d or \u201cthe way or manner described.\u201d\nBlack\u2019s Law Dictionary, at 1246; 15 Oxford English Dictionary 887\n(2d ed. 1989). The disputed phrase \u201centitled so to obtain\u201d thus\nasks whether one has the right, in \u201cthe same manner as has been\nstated,\u201d to obtain the relevant information. And the only manner of\nobtaining information already stated in the definitional provision\nis \u201cvia a computer [one] is otherwise authorized to access.\u201d Reply\nBrief 3. Putting that together, Van Buren contends that the\ndisputed phrase\u2014\u201cis not entitledsoto obtain\u201d\u2014plainly\nrefers to information one is not allowed to obtainby using a\ncomputer that he is authorized to access. On this reading, if a\nperson has access to information stored in a computer\u2014e.g.,in \u201cFolder Y,\u201d from which the person could permissibly pull\ninformation\u2014then he does not violate the CFAA by obtaining such\ninformation, regardless of whether he pulled the information for a\nprohibited purpose. But if the information is instead located in\nprohibited \u201cFolder X,\u201d to which the person lacks access, he\nviolates the CFAA by obtaining such information.The Government agrees that the statute uses \u201cso\u201d\nin the word\u2019s term-of-reference sense, but it argues that \u201cso\u201d\nsweeps more broadly. It reads the phrase \u201cis not entitledsoto obtain\u201d to refer to information one was not allowed to obtainin the particular manner or circumstances in which he obtained\nit. The manner or circumstances in which one has a right to\nobtain information, the Government says, are defined by any\n\u201cspecifically and explicitly\u201d communicated limits on one\u2019s right to\naccess information. Brief for United States 19. As the Government\nsees it, an employee might lawfully pull information from Folder Y\nin the morning for a permissible purpose\u2014say, to prepare for a\nbusiness meeting\u2014but unlawfully pull the same information from\nFolder Y in the afternoon for a prohibited purpose\u2014say, to help\ndraft a resume to submit to a competitor employer.The Government\u2019s interpretation has surface\nappeal but proves to be a sleight of hand. While highlighting that\n\u201cso\u201d refers to a \u201cmanner or circumstance,\u201d the Government\nsimultaneously ignores the definition\u2019s further instruction that\nsuch manner or circumstance already will \u201c\u00a0\u2018ha[ve] been\nstated,\u2019\u00a0\u201d \u201c\u00a0\u2018asserted,\u2019\u00a0\u201d or\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018described.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId.,at 18 (quoting Black\u2019s Law\nDictionary, at 1246; 15 Oxford English Dictionary, at 887). Under\nthe Government\u2019s approach, the relevant circumstance\u2014the one\nrendering a person\u2019s conduct illegal\u2014is not identified earlier in\nthe statute. Instead, \u201cso\u201d capturesanycircumstance-based\nlimit appearinganywhere\u2014in the United States Code, a state\nstatute, a private agreement, or anywhere else. And while the\nGovernment tries to cabin its interpretation by suggesting that any\nsuch limit must be \u201cspecifically and explicitly\u201d stated, \u201cexpress,\u201d\nand \u201cinherent in the authorization itself,\u201d the Government does not\nidentify any textual basis for these guardrails. Brief for United\nStates 19; Tr. of Oral Arg. 41.Van Buren\u2019s account of \u201cso\u201d\u2014namely, that \u201cso\u201d\nreferences the previously stated \u201cmanner or circumstance\u201d in the\ntext of \u00a71030(e)(6) itself\u2014is more plausible than the Government\u2019s.\n\u201cSo\u201d is not a free-floating term that provides a hook for any\nlimitation stated anywhere. It refers to a stated, identifiable\nproposition from the \u201cpreceding\u201d text; indeed, \u201cso\u201d typically\n\u201c[r]epresent[s]\u201d a \u201cword or phrase already employed,\u201d thereby\navoiding the need for repetition. 15 Oxford English Dictionary, at\n887; see Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 2160 (1986)\n(so \u201coften used as a substitute .\u00a0.\u00a0. to express the idea\nof a preceding phrase\u201d). Myriad federal statutes illustrate this\nordinary usage.[3] We agree\nwith Van Buren: The phrase \u201cis not entitled so to obtain\u201d is best\nread to refer to information that a person is not entitled to\nobtain by using a computer that he is authorized to\naccess.[4]2The Government\u2019s primary counterargument is\nthat Van Buren\u2019s reading renders the word \u201cso\u201d superfluous. Recall\nthe definition: \u201cto access a computer with authorization and to use\nsuch access to obtain .\u00a0.\u00a0. information in the computer\nthat the accesser is not entitledsoto obtain.\u201d \u00a71030(e)(6)\n(emphasis added). According to the Government, \u201cso\u201d adds nothing to\nthe sentence if it refers solely to the earlier stated manner of\nobtaining the information through use of a computer one has\naccessed with authorization. What matters on Van Buren\u2019s reading,\nas the Government sees it, is simply that the person obtain\ninformation that he is not entitled to obtain\u2014and that point could\nbe made even if \u201cso\u201d were deleted. By contrast, the Government\ninsists, \u201cso\u201d makes a valuable contribution if it incorporates all\nof the circumstances that might qualify a person\u2019s right to obtain\ninformation. Because only its interpretation gives \u201cso\u201d work to do,\nthe Government contends, the rule against superfluity means that\nits interpretation wins. SeeRepublic of Sudanv.Harrison, 587 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2019) (slip op., at\n10).But the canon does not help the Government\nbecause Van Buren\u2019s reading does not render \u201cso\u201d superfluous. As\nVan Buren points out, without \u201cso,\u201d the statute would allow\nindividuals to use their right to obtain information in nondigital\nform as a defense to CFAA liability. Consider, for example, a\nperson who downloads restricted personnel files he is not entitled\nto obtain by using his computer. Such a person could argue that he\nwas \u201centitled to obtain\u201d the information if he had the right to\naccess personnel files through another method (e.g.,by\nrequesting hard copies of the files from human resources). With\n\u201cso,\u201d the CFAA forecloses that theory of defense. The statute is\nconcerned with what a person does on a computer; it does not excuse\nhacking into an electronic personnel file if the hacker could have\nwalked down the hall to pick up a physical copy.This clarification is significant because it\nunderscores that one kind of entitlement to information counts: the\nright to access the information by using a computer. That can\nexpand liability, as the above example shows. But it narrows\nliability too. Without the word \u201cso,\u201d the statute could be read to\nincorporate all kinds of limitations on one\u2019s entitlement to\ninformation. The dissent\u2019s take on the statute illustrates why.3While the dissent accepts Van Buren\u2019s\ndefinition of \u201cso,\u201d it would arrive at the Government\u2019s result by\nway of the word \u201centitled.\u201d One is \u201centitled\u201d to do something, the\ndissent contends, only when \u201c\u00a0\u2018proper grounds\u2019\u00a0\u201d are in\nplace.Post, at 3 (opinion of Thomas, J.) (quoting Black\u2019s\nLaw Dictionary, at 477). Deciding whether a person was \u201centitled\u201d\nto obtain information, the dissent continues, therefore demands a\n\u201ccircumstance dependent\u201d analysis of whether access was proper.Post, at 3. This reading, like the Government\u2019s, would\nextend the statute\u2019s reach to any circumstance-based limit\nappearing anywhere.The dissent\u2019s approach to the word \u201centitled\u201d\nfares fine in the abstract but poorly in context. The statute does\nnot refer to \u201cinformation .\u00a0.\u00a0. that the accesser is not\nentitled to obtain.\u201d It refers to \u201cinformation .\u00a0.\u00a0. that\nthe accesser is not entitledsoto obtain.\u201d 18\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71030(e)(6) (emphasis added). The word\n\u201centitled,\u201d then, does not stand alone, inviting the reader to\nconsider the full scope of the accesser\u2019s entitlement to\ninformation. The modifying phrase \u201cso to obtain\u201d directs the reader\nto consider a specific limitation on the accesser\u2019s entitlement:\nhis entitlement to obtain the information \u201cin the manner previously\nstated.\u201dSupra,at 7. And as already explained, the manner\npreviously stated is using a computer one is authorized to access.\nThus, while giving lipservice to Van Buren\u2019s reading of \u201cso,\u201d the\ndissent, like the Government, declines to give \u201cso\u201d any limiting\nfunction.[5]The dissent cannot have it both ways. The\nconsequence of accepting Van Buren\u2019s reading of \u201cso\u201d is the\nnarrowed scope of \u201centitled.\u201d In fact, the dissent\u2019s examples\nimplicitly concede as much: They all omit the word \u201cso,\u201d thereby\ngiving \u201centitled\u201d its full sweep. Seepost, at 3\u20134. An\napproach that must rewrite the statute to work is even less\npersuasive than the Government\u2019s.4The Government falls back on what it describes\nas the \u201ccommon parlance\u201d meaning of the phrase \u201cexceeds authorized\naccess.\u201d Brief for United States 20\u201321. According to the\nGovernment, any ordinary speaker of the English language would\nthink that Van Buren \u201cexceed[ed] his authorized access\u201d to the law\nenforcement database when he obtained license-plate information for\npersonal purposes.Id.,at 21. The dissent, for its part,\nasserts that this point \u201csettles\u201d the case.Post, at 9.If the phrase \u201cexceeds authorized access\u201d were\nall we had to go on, the Government and the dissent might have a\npoint. But both breeze by the CFAA\u2019s explicit definition of the\nphrase \u201cexceeds authorized access.\u201d When \u201ca statute includes an\nexplicit definition\u201d of a term, \u201cwe must follow that definition,\neven if it varies from a term\u2019s ordinary meaning.\u201dTanzinv.Tanvir, 592 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2020) (slip op., at 3)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). So the relevant question is not\nwhether Van Buren exceeded his authorized access but whether he\nexceeded his authorized accessas the CFAA defines that\nphrase. And as we have already explained, the statutory\ndefinition favors Van Buren\u2019s reading.That reading, moreover, is perfectly consistent\nwith the way that an \u201cappropriately informed\u201d speaker of the\nlanguage would understand the meaning of \u201cexceeds authorized\naccess.\u201d Nelson, What Is Textualism? 91 Va. L. Rev. 347, 354\n(2005). When interpreting statutes, courts take note of terms that\ncarry \u201ctechnical meaning[s].\u201d A. Scalia & B. Garner, Reading\nLaw: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 73 (2012). \u201cAccess\u201d is one\nsuch term, long carrying a \u201cwell established\u201d meaning in the\n\u201ccomputational sense\u201d\u2014a meaning that matters when interpreting a\nstatute about computers. American Heritage Dictionary 10 (3d ed.\n1992). In the computing context, \u201caccess\u201d references the act of\nentering a computer \u201csystem itself\u00a0\u201d or a particular \u201cpart of\na computer system,\u201d such as files, folders, or databases.[6] It is thus consistent with that\nmeaning to equate \u201cexceed[ing] authorized access\u201d with the act of\nentering a part of the system to which a computer user lacks access\nprivileges.[7] The Government\nand the dissent\u2019s broader interpretation is neither the only\npossible nor even necessarily the most natural one.BWhile the statute\u2019s language \u201cspells trouble\u201d\nfor the Government\u2019s position, a \u201cwider look at the statute\u2019s\nstructure gives us even more reason for pause.\u201dRomag Fasteners,\nInc.v.Fossil Group, Inc., 590 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___\u2013___\n(2020) (slip op., at 2\u20133).The interplay between the \u201cwithout\nauthorization\u201d and \u201cexceeds authorized access\u201d clauses of\nsubsection (a)(2) is particularly probative. Those clauses specify\ntwo distinct ways of obtaining information unlawfully.First, an individual violates the provision when he\n\u201caccesses a computer without authorization.\u201d \u00a71030(a)(2).Second, an individual violates the provision when he\n\u201cexceeds authorized access\u201d by accessing a computer \u201cwith\nauthorization\u201d and then obtaining information he is \u201cnot entitled\nso to obtain.\u201d \u00a7\u00a71030(a)(2), (e)(6). Van Buren\u2019s reading places the\nprovision\u2019s parts \u201cinto an harmonious whole.\u201dRobertsv.Sea-Land Services, Inc.,566 U.S.\n93, 100 (2012) (internal quotation marks omitted). The\nGovernment\u2019s does not.Start with Van Buren\u2019s view. The \u201cwithout\nauthorization\u201d clause, Van Buren contends, protects computers\nthemselves by targeting so-called outside hackers\u2014those who\n\u201cacces[s] a computer without any permission at all.\u201dLVRC\nHoldings LLCv.Brekka, 581 F.3d 1127, 1133 (CA9 2009);\nsee alsoPulte Homes, Inc.v.Laborers\u2019 Int\u2019l Union of\nNorth Am., 648 F.3d 295, 304 (CA6 2011). Van Buren reads the\n\u201cexceeds authorized access\u201d clause to provide complementary\nprotection for certain information within computers. It does so,\nVan Buren asserts, by targeting so-called inside hackers\u2014those who\naccess a computer with permission, but then \u201c\u00a0\u2018exceed\u2019 the\nparameters of authorized access by entering an area of the computer\nto which [that] authorization does not extend.\u201dUnited\nStatesv.Valle, 807 F.3d 508, 524 (CA2 2015).Van Buren\u2019s account of subsection (a)(2) makes\nsense of the statutory structure because it treats the \u201cwithout\nauthorization\u201d and \u201cexceeds authorized access\u201d clauses\nconsistently. Under Van Buren\u2019s reading, liability under both\nclauses stems from a gates-up-or-down inquiry\u2014one either can or\ncannot access a computer system, and one either can or cannot\naccess certain areas within the system.[8] And reading both clauses to adopt a gates-up-or-down\napproach aligns with the computer-context understanding of access\nas entry. Seesupra, at 11\u201312.[9]By contrast, the Government\u2019s reading of the\n\u201cexceeds authorized access\u201d clause creates \u201cinconsistenc[ies] with\nthe design and structure\u201d of subsection (a)(2).University of\nTex. Southwestern Medical Centerv.Nassar,570 U.S.\n338, 353 (2013). As discussed, the Government reads the\n\u201cexceeds authorized access\u201d clause to incorporate purpose-based\nlimits contained in contracts and workplace policies. Yet the\nGovernment does not read such limits into the threshold question\nwhether someone uses a computer \u201cwithout authorization\u201d\u2014even though\nsimilar purpose restrictions, like a rule against personal use,\noften govern one\u2019s right to access a computer in the first place.\nSee,e.g.,Royal Truck&Trailer Sales &\nServ.,Inc.v.Kraft, 974 F.3d 756, 757 (CA6\n2020). Thus, the Government proposes to read the first phrase\n\u201cwithout authorization\u201d as a gates-up-or-down inquiry and the\nsecond phrase \u201cexceeds authorized access\u201d as one that depends on\nthe circumstances. The Government does not explain why the statute\nwould prohibit accessing computer information, but not the computer\nitself, for an improper purpose.[10]The Government\u2019s position has another structural\nproblem. Recall that violating \u00a71030(a)(2), the provision under\nwhich Van Buren was charged, also gives rise to civil liability.\nSee \u00a71030(g). Provisions defining \u201cdamage\u201d and \u201closs\u201d specify what\na plaintiff in a civil suit can recover. \u201c\u00a0\u2018[D]amage,\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nthe statute provides, means \u201cany impairment to the integrity or\navailability of data, a program, a system, or information.\u201d\n\u00a71030(e)(8). The term \u201closs\u201d likewise relates to costs caused by\nharm to computer data, programs, systems, or information services.\n\u00a71030(e)(11). The statutory definitions of \u201cdamage\u201d and \u201closs\u201d thus\nfocus on technological harms\u2014such as the corruption of files\u2014of the\ntype unauthorized users cause to computer systems and data.\nLimiting \u201cdamage\u201d and \u201closs\u201d in this way makes sense in a scheme\n\u201caimed at preventing the typical consequences of hacking.\u201dRoyal\nTruck, 974 F.\u00a03d, at 760. The term\u2019s definitions are ill\nfitted, however, to remediating \u201cmisuse\u201d of sensitive information\nthat employees may permissibly access using their computers.Ibid.Van Buren\u2019s situation is illustrative: His run of the\nlicense plate did not impair the \u201cintegrity or availability\u201d of\ndata, nor did it otherwise harm the database system itself.CPivoting from text and structure, the\nGovernment claims that precedent and statutory history support its\ninterpretation. These arguments are easily dispatched.As for precedent, the Government asserts that\nthis Court\u2019s decision inMusacchiov.United States,\n577 U.S. 237 (2016), bolsters its reading. There, in addressing a\nquestion about the standard of review for instructional error, the\nCourt described \u00a71030(a)(2) as prohibiting \u201c(1) obtaining access\nwithout authorization; and (2) obtaining access with authorization\nbut then using that access improperly.\u201dId., at 240. This\nparaphrase of the statute does not do much for the Government. As\nan initial matter,Musacchiodid not address\u2014much less\nresolve in the Government\u2019s favor\u2014the \u201cpoint now at issue,\u201d and we\nthus \u201care not bound to follow\u201d any dicta in the case.Central\nVa. Community Collegev.Katz,546\nU.S. 356, 363 (2006). But in any event, Van Buren\u2019s\ninterpretation, no less than the Government\u2019s, involves \u201cusing\n[one\u2019s] access improperly.\u201d It is plainly \u201cimproper\u201d for one to use\nthe opportunity his computer access provides to obtain prohibited\ninformation from within the computer.As for statutory history, the Government claims\nthat the original 1984 Act supports its interpretation of the\ncurrent version. In a precursor to the \u201cexceeds authorized access\u201d\nclause, the 1984 Act covered any person who, \u201chaving accessed a\ncomputer with authorization, uses the opportunity such access\nprovides for purposes to which such authorization does not extend,\u201d\nand thus expressly alluded to the purpose of an insider\u2019s computer\naccess. 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71030(a)(2) (1982 ed. Supp. III).\nAccording to the Government, this confirms that the amended\nCFAA\u2014which makes no mention of purpose in defining \u201cexceeds\nauthorized access\u201d\u2014likewise covers insiders like Van Buren who use\ntheir computer access for an unauthorized purpose.[11] The Government\u2019s argument gets things\nprecisely backward. \u201cWhen Congress amends legislation, courts must\npresume it intends the change to have real and substantial effect.\u201dRossv.Blake, 578 U.S. 632, 641\u2013642 (2016) (internal\nquotation marks and brackets omitted). Congress\u2019 choice toremovethe statute\u2019s reference to purpose thus cutsagainstreading the statute \u201cto capture that very concept.\u201d\nBrief for United States 22. The statutory history thus hurts rather\nthan helps the Government\u2019s position.IIITo top it all off, the Government\u2019s\ninterpretation of the statute would attach criminal penalties to a\nbreathtaking amount of commonplace computer activity. Van Buren\nframes the far-reaching consequences of the Government\u2019s reading as\ntriggering the rule of lenity or constitutional avoidance. That is\nnot how we see it: Because the text, context, and structure support\nVan Buren\u2019s reading, neither of these canons is in play. Still, the\nfallout underscores the implausibility of the Government\u2019s\ninterpretation. It is \u201cextra icing on a cake already frosted.\u201dYatesv.United States,574 U.S.\n528, 557 (2015) (Kagan, J., dissenting).If the \u201cexceeds authorized access\u201d clause\ncriminalizes every violation of a computer-use policy, then\nmillions of otherwise law-abiding citizens are criminals. Take the\nworkplace. Employers commonly state that computers and electronic\ndevices can be used only for business purposes. So on the\nGovernment\u2019s reading of the statute, an employee who sends a\npersonal e-mail or reads the news using her work computer has\nviolated the CFAA. Or consider the Internet. Many websites,\nservices, and databases\u2014which provide \u201cinformation\u201d from \u201cprotected\ncomputer[s],\u201d \u00a71030(a)(2)(C)\u2014authorize a user\u2019s access only upon\nhis agreement to follow specified terms of service. If the \u201cexceeds\nauthorized access\u201d clause encompasses violations of\ncircumstance-based access restrictions on employers\u2019 computers, it\nis difficult to see why it would not also encompass violations of\nsuch restrictions on website providers\u2019 computers. And indeed,\nnumerousamiciexplain why the Government\u2019s reading of\nsubsection (a)(2) would do just that\u2014criminalize everything from\nembellishing an online-dating profile to using a pseudonym on\nFacebook. See Brief for Orin Kerr asAmicus Curiae10\u201311;\nBrief for Technology Companies asAmici Curiae6, n.\u00a03,\n11; see also Brief for Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press\net\u00a0al. asAmici Curiae10\u201313 (journalism activity);\nBrief for Kyratso Karahalios et\u00a0al. asAmici Curiae11\u201317 (online civil-rights testing and research).In response to these points, the Government\nposits that other terms in the statute\u2014specifically \u201cauthorization\u201d\nand \u201cuse\u201d\u2014\u201cmay well\u201d serve to cabin its prosecutorial power. Brief\nfor United States 35; see Tr. of Oral Arg. 38, 40, 58\n(\u201cinstrumental\u201d use; \u201cindividualized\u201d and \u201cfairly specific\u201d\nauthorization). Yet the Government stops far short of endorsing\nsuch limitations. Cf. Brief for United States 37 (concept of\n\u201cauthorization\u201d \u201cmay not logically apply\u201d);id.,at 38\n(\u201c\u00a0\u2018use\u2019\u00a0\u201d might be read in a more \u201climited\u201d fashion,\neven though it \u201coften has a broader definition\u201d); see also,e.g.,post, at 11\u201312 (mens rearequirement\n\u201cmight\u201d preclude liability in some cases). Nor does it cite any\nprior instance in which it has read the statute to contain such\nlimitations\u2014to the contrary, Van Buren cites instances where it\nhasn\u2019t. See Reply Brief 14\u201315, 17 (collecting cases); cf.Sandvigv.Barr, 451 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d 73, 81\u201382 (DC\n2020) (discussing Department of Justice testimony indicating that\nthe Government could \u201c\u00a0\u2018bring a CFAA prosecution based\u2019\u00a0\u201d\non terms-of-service violations causing \u201c\u00a0\u2018de minimis\nharm\u2019\u00a0\u201d). If anything, the Government\u2019s current CFAA charging\npolicy shows why Van Buren\u2019s concerns are far from \u201chypothetical,\u201dpost, at 12: The policy instructs that federal prosecution\n\u201cmay notbe warranted\u201d\u2014not that it would be prohibited\u2014\u201cif\nthe defendant exceed[s] authorized access solely by violating an\naccess restriction contained in a contractual agreement or term of\nservice with an Internet service provider or website.\u201d[12] And while the Government insists\nthat the intent requirement serves as yet another safety valve,\nthat requirement would do nothing for those who intentionally use\ntheir computers in a way their \u201cjob or policy prohibits\u201d\u2014for\nexample, by checking sports scores or paying bills at work. App.\n39.One final observation: The Government\u2019s approach\nwould inject arbitrariness into the assessment of criminal\nliability. The Government concedes, as it must, that the \u201cexceeds\nauthorized access\u201d clause prohibits only unlawful information\n\u201caccess,\u201d not downstream information \u201c\u00a0\u2018misus[e].\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nBrief in Opposition 17 (statute does not cover \u201c\u00a0\u2018subsequen[t]\nmisus[e of] information\u2019\u00a0\u201d). But the line between the two can\nbe thin on the Government\u2019s reading. Because purpose-based limits\non access are often designed with an eye toward information misuse,\nthey can be expressed as either access or use restrictions. For\nexample, one police department might prohibitusing a\nconfidential databasefor a non-law-enforcement purpose (an\naccess restriction), while another might prohibitusing\ninformationfrom the databasefor a non-law-enforcement\npurpose (a use restriction). Conduct like Van Buren\u2019s can be\ncharacterized either way, and an employer might not see much\ndifference between the two. On the Government\u2019s reading, however,\nthe conduct would violate the CFAA only if the employer phrased the\npolicy as an access restriction. An interpretation that stakes so\nmuch on a fine distinction controlled by the drafting practices of\nprivate parties is hard to sell as the most plausible.IVIn sum, an individual \u201cexceeds authorized\naccess\u201d when he accesses a computer with authorization but then\nobtains information located in particular areas of the\ncomputer\u2014such as files, folders, or databases\u2014that are off limits\nto him. The parties agree that Van Buren accessed the law\nenforcement database system with authorization. The only question\nis whether Van Buren could use the system to retrieve license-plate\ninformation. Both sides agree that he could. Van Buren accordingly\ndid not \u201cexcee[d] authorized access\u201d to the database, as the CFAA\ndefines that phrase, even though he obtained information from the\ndatabase for an improper purpose. We therefore reverse the contrary\njudgment of the Eleventh Circuit and remand the case for further\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.Notes1Van Buren also was\ncharged with and convicted of honest-services wire fraud. In a\nseparate holding not at issue here, the United States Court of\nAppeals for the Eleventh Circuit vacated Van Buren\u2019s\nhonest-services fraud conviction as contrary to this Court\u2019s\ndecision inMcDonnellv.United States, 579 U.S. 550\n(2016).2CompareRoyal Truck\n& Trailer Sales & Serv., Inc.v.Kraft, 974 F.3d\n756 (CA6 2020);United Statesv.Valle, 807 F.3d 508\n(CA2 2015);WEC Carolina Energy Solutions LLCv.Miller, 687 F.3d 199 (CA4 2012);United Statesv.Nosal, 676 F.3d 854 (CA9 2012) (en banc), withUnited\nStatesv.Rodriguez, 628 F.3d 1258 (CA11 2010);United Statesv.John, 597 F.3d 263 (CA5 2010);International Airport Centers, L.L.C.v.Citrin,440 F.3d 418(CA7 2006);EF Cultural Travel BVv.Explorica,Inc.,274 F.3d 577(CA1 2001).3See,e.g., 7\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7171(8) (authorizing Secretary of Agriculture\n\u201c[t]o sell guayule or rubber processed from guayule and to use\nfunds so obtained in replanting and maintaining an area\u201d); 18\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7648 (any person responsible for \u201csafe-keeping\nof the public moneys\u201d who \u201cloans, uses, or converts to his own use\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. any portion of the public moneys .\u00a0.\u00a0. is\nguilty of embezzlement of the money so loaned, used, converted,\ndeposited, or exchanged\u201d); \u00a71163 (\u201c[W]hoever embezzles, steals,\n[or] knowingly converts to his use\u201d money or property \u201cbelonging to\nany Indian tribal organization,\u201d or \u201c[w]hoever, knowing any such\nmoneys .\u00a0.\u00a0. or other property to have been so embezzled,\nstolen, [or] converted .\u00a0.\u00a0. retains the same with intent\nto convert it to his use,\u201d is subject to punishment); \u00a71708\n(\u201c[W]hoever steals, takes, or abstracts, or by fraud or deception\nobtains, or attempts so to obtain,\u201d parcels of mail is subject to\npunishment).4The dissent criticizes\nthis interpretation as inconsistent with \u201cbasic principles of\nproperty law,\u201d and in particular the \u201cfamiliar rule that an\nentitlement to use another person\u2019s property is circumstance\nspecific.\u201dPost, at 4\u20135 (opinion of Thomas, J.).

Our reading instead\ninterprets the phrase \u201cso to obtain\u201d to incorporate the single\n\u201ccircumstance\u201d of permissible information access identified by the\nstatute: obtaining the information by using one\u2019s\ncomputer.61 Oxford English\nDictionary 72 (2d ed. 1989) (\u201c[t]o gain access to .\u00a0.\u00a0.\ndata, etc., held in a computer or computer-based system, or the\nsystem itself\u00a0\u201d); Random House Dictionary of the English\nLanguage 11 (2d ed. 1987) (\u201cComputers. to locate (data) for\ntransfer from one part of a computer system to another\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. \u201d); see also C.

But when a\nstatute, like this one, is \u201caddressing a .\u00a0.\u00a0. technical\nsubject, a specialized meaning is to be expected.\u201d Scalia, Reading\nLaw, at 73. Consistent with that principle, our interpretation\ntracks the specialized meaning of \u201caccess\u201d in the computer context.\nThis reading is far from \u201c\u00a0\u2018repugnant to\u2019\u00a0\u201d the meaning\nof the phrase \u201cexceeds authorized access,\u201dpost, at\n9\u2014unlike, say, a definitional provision directing that \u201c\u00a0\u2018the\nworddogis deemed to include all horses.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Scalia,supra, at 232, n. 29.8For present purposes, we\nneed not address whether this inquiry turns only on technological\n(or \u201ccode-based\u201d) limitations on access, or instead also looks to\nlimits contained in contracts or policies. Cf. Brief for Orin Kerr\nasAmicus Curiae7 (urging adoption of code-based\napproach).9Van Buren\u2019s\ngates-up-or-down reading also aligns with the CFAA\u2019s prohibition on\npassword trafficking. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 33. Enacted alongside\nthe \u201cexceeds authorized access\u201d definition in 1986, the\npassword-trafficking provision bars the sale of \u201cany password or\nsimilar information through which a computer may be accessed\nwithout authorization.\u201d \u00a71030(a)(6). The provision thus\ncontemplates a \u201cspecific type of authorization\u2014that is,\nauthentication,\u201d which turns on whether a user\u2019s credentials allow\nhim to proceed past a computer\u2019s access gate, rather than on other,\nscope-based restrictions. Bellia, A Code-Based Approach to\nUnauthorized Access Under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, 84 Geo.\nWash. L. Rev. 1442, 1470 (2016); cf. A Dictionary of Computing, at\n30 (defining \u201cauthorization\u201d as a \u201cprocess by which users, having\ncompleted an\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. authentication stage, gain or are\ndenied access to particular resources based on their\nentitlement\u201d).10Unlike the Government, the dissent\nwould read both clauses of subsection (a)(2) to require a\ncircumstance-specific analysis. Doing so, the dissent contends,\nwould reflect that \u201c[p]roperty law generally protects against both\nunlawful entryandunlawful use.\u201dPost, at 7. This\ninterpretation suffers from structural problems of its own.\nConsider the standard rule prohibiting the use of one\u2019s work\ncomputer for personal purposes. Under the dissent\u2019s approach, an\nemployee\u2019s computer access would bewithoutauthorization if\nhe logged on to the computer with the purpose of obtaining a file\nfor personal reasons. In that event, obtaining the file would not\nviolate the \u201cexceeds authorized access\u201d clause, which applies only\nwhen one accesses a computer \u201cwithauthorization.\u201d\n\u00a71030(e)(6) (emphasis added). The dissent\u2019s reading would therefore\nleave the \u201cexceeds authorized access\u201d clause with no work to do\nmuch of the time\u2014an outcome that Van Buren\u2019s interpretation (and,\nfor that matter, the Government\u2019s) avoids.11While\nthe Government insists that Congress made this change\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018merely to clarify the language\u2019\u00a0\u201d of \u00a71030(a)(2),\nBrief for United States 28, the dissent has a different take. In\nthe dissent\u2019s telling, the 1986 amendment in fact \u201cexpand[ed]\u201d the\nprovision to reach \u201ctime and manner\u201d restrictions on computer\naccess\u2014not just purpose-based ones.Post, at 10\u201311. The\ndissent\u2019s distinct explanation for why Congress removed\n\u00a71030(a)(2)\u2019s reference to \u201cpurpose\u201d requires accepting that the\n\u201cexceeds authorized access\u201d definition supports a\ncircumstance-specific approach. We reject the dissent\u2019s premise for\nthe textual and structural reasons already discussed.12Memorandum from U.\u00a0S. Atty. Gen.\nto U.\u00a0S. Attys. & Assistant Attys.
