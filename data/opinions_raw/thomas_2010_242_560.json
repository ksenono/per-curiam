S. ____ (2010)SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESNO. 09-448BRIDGET HARDT, PETITIONERv.RELIANCE\nSTANDARD LIFE INSURANCE COMPANYon writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the fourth circuit[May 24, 2010]Justice Thomas delivered the\nopinion of the Court.In most lawsuits seeking relief\nunder the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA),\n88 Stat. 829, as amended, 29 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71001et seq.,\n\u201ca reasonable attorney\u2019s fee and costs\u201d are available \u201cto either\nparty\u201d at the court\u2019s \u201cdiscretion.\u201d \u00a71132(g)(1). The Court of\nAppeals for the Fourth Circuit has interpreted \u00a71132(g)(1) to\nrequire that a fee claimant be a \u201cprevailing party\u201d before he may\nseek a fees award. We reject this interpretation as contrary to\n\u00a71132(g)(1)\u2019s plain text. We hold instead that a court \u201cin its\ndiscretion\u201d may award fees and costs \u201cto either party,\u201dibid.,as long as the fee claimant has achieved \u201csome\ndegree of success on the merits,\u201dRuckels- hausv.Sierra Club,463 U. S. 680, 694 (1983).IIn 2000, while working as an\nexecutive assistant to the president of textile manufacturer Dan\nRiver, Inc., petitioner Bridget Hardt began experiencing neck and\nshoulder pain. Her doctors eventually diagnosed her with carpal\ntunnel syndrome. Because surgeries on both her wrists failed to\nalleviate her pain, Hardt stopped working in January 2003.In August 2003, Hardt sought\nlong-term disability benefits from Dan River\u2019s Group Long-Term\nDisability Insurance Program Plan (Plan). Dan River administers the\nPlan, which is subject to ERISA, but respondent Reliance Standard\nLife Insurance Company decides whether a claimant qualifies for\nbenefits under the Plan and underwrites any benefits awarded.\nReliance provisionally approved Hardt\u2019s claim, telling her that\nfinal approval hinged on her performance in a functional capacities\nevaluation intended to assess the impact of her carpal tunnel\nsyndrome and neck pain on her ability to work.Hardt completed the functional capacities\nevaluation in October 2003. The evaluator summarized Hardt\u2019s\nmedical history, observed her resulting physical limitations, and\nultimately found that Hardt could perform some amount of sedentary\nwork. Based on this finding, Reliance concluded that Hardt was not\ntotally disabled within the meaning of the Plan and denied her\nclaim for disability benefits. Hardt filed an administrative\nappeal. Reliance reversed itself in part, finding that Hardt was\ntotally disabled from her regular occupation, and was therefore\nentitled to temporary disability benefits for 24 months.While her administrative appeal was pending,\nHardt began experiencing new symptoms in her feet and calves,\nincluding tingling, pain, and numbness. One of her physicians\ndiagnosed her with small-fiber neuropathy, a condition that\nincreased her pain and decreased her physical capabilities over the\nensuing months.Hardt eventually applied to the Social\nSecurity Administration for disability benefits under the Social\nSecurity Act. Her application included questionnaires completed by\ntwo of her treating physicians, which described Hardt\u2019s symptoms\nand stated the doctors\u2019 conclusion that Hardt could not return to\nfull gainful employment because of her neuropathy and other\nailments. In February 2005, the Social Security Administration\ngranted Hardt\u2019s application and awarded her disability\nbenefits.About two months later, Reliance told Hardt\nthat her Plan benefits would expire at the end of the 24-month\nperiod. Reliance explained that under the Plan\u2019s terms, only\nindividuals who are \u201ctotally disabled from all occupations\u201d were\neligible for benefits beyond that period, App. to Pet. for Cert.\n36a, and adhered to its conclusion that, based on its review of\nHardt\u2019s records, Hardt was not \u201ctotally disabled\u201d as defined by the\nPlan. Reliance also demanded that Hardt pay Reliance $14,913.23 to\noffset the disability benefits she had received from the Social\nSecurity Administration. (The Plan contains a provision\ncoordinating benefits with Social Security payments.) Hardt paid\nReliance the offset.Hardt then filed another administrative\nappeal. She gave Reliance all of her medical records, the\nquestionnaires she had submitted to the Social Security\nAdministration, and an updated questionnaire from one of her\nphysicians. Reliance asked Hardt to supplement this material with\nanother functional capacities evaluation. When Reliance referred\nHardt for the updated evaluation, it did not ask the evaluator to\nreview Hardt for neuropathic pain, even though it knew that Hardt\nhad been diagnosed with neuropathy after her first evaluation.Hardt appeared for the updated evaluation in\nDecember 2005, and appeared for another evaluation in January 2006.\nThe evaluators deemed both evaluations invalid because Hardt\u2019s\nefforts were \u201csubmaximal.\u201dId., at 37a. One evaluator\nrecorded that Hardt \u201crefused multiple tests \u2026 for fear of\nnausea/illness/further pain complaints.\u201dIbid.(internal\nquotation marks omitted).Lacking an updated functional capacities\nevaluation, Reliance hired a physician and a vocation\nrehabilitation counselor to help it resolve Hardt\u2019s administrative\nappeal. The physician did not examine Hardt; instead, he reviewed\nsome, but not all, of Hardt\u2019s medical records. Based on that\nreview, the physician produced a report in which he opined that\nHardt\u2019s health was expected to improve. His report, however, did\nnot mention Hardt\u2019s pain medications or the questionnaires that\nHardt\u2019s attending physicians had completed as part of her\napplication for Social Security benefits. The vocational\nrehabilitation counselor, in turn, performed a labor market study\n(based on Hardt\u2019s health in 2003) that identified eight employment\nopportunities suitable for Hardt. After reviewing the physician\u2019s\nreport, the labor market study, and the results of the 2003\nfunctional capacities evaluation, Reliance concluded that its\ndecision to terminate Hardt\u2019s benefits was correct. It advised\nHardt of this decision in March 2006.After exhausting her administrative remedies,\nHardt sued Reliance in the United States District Court for the\nEastern District of Virginia. She alleged that Reliance violated\nERISA by wrongfully denying her claim for long-term disability\nbenefits. See \u00a71132(a)(1)(B). The parties filed cross-motions for\nsummary judgment, both of which the District Court denied.The court first rejected Reliance\u2019s request\nfor summary judgment affirming the denial of benefits, finding that\n\u201cReliance\u2019s decision to deny benefits was based on incomplete\ninformation.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 42a. Most prominently, none of\nthe functional capacities evaluations to which Hardt had submitted\nhad \u201cassessed the impact of neuropathy and neuropathic pain on Ms.\nHardt.\u201dIbid.In addition, the reviewing physician\u2019s\nreport \u201cwas itself incomplete\u201d; the basis for the physician\u2019s\n\u201cmedical conclusions [wa]s extremely vague and conclusory,\u201dibid., and the physician had \u201cfailed to cite any medical\nevidence to support his conclusions,\u201did., at 43a, or \u201cto\naddress the treating physicians\u2019 contradictory medical findings,\u201did., at 44a. The court also found that Reliance had\n\u201cimproperly rejected much of the evidence that Ms. Hardt\nsubmitted,\u201did., at 45a, and had \u201cfurther ignored the\nsubstantial amount of pain medication Ms. Hardt\u2019s treating\nphysicians had prescribed to her,\u201did., at 46a.\nAccordingly, the court thought it \u201cclear that Reliance\u2019s decision\nto deny Ms. Hardt long-term disability benefits was not based on\nsubstantial evidence.\u201dId., at 47a.The District Court then denied Hardt\u2019s motion\nfor summary judgment, which contended that Reliance\u2019s decision to\ndeny benefits was unreasonable as a matter of law. In so doing,\nhowever, the court found \u201ccompelling evidence\u201d in the record that\n\u201cMs. Hardt [wa]s totally disabled due to her neuropathy.\u201dId., at 48a. Although it was \u201cinclined to rule in Ms.\nHardt\u2019s favor,\u201d the court concluded that \u201cit would be unwise to\ntake this step without first giving Reliance the chance to address\nthe deficiencies in its approach.\u201dIbid.In the District\nCourt\u2019s view, a remand to Reliance was warranted because \u201c[t]his\ncase presents one of those scenarios where the plan administrator\nhas failed to comply with the ERISA guidelines,\u201d meaning \u201cMs. Hardt\ndid not get the kind of review to which she was entitled under\napplicable law.\u201dIbid.Accordingly, the court instructed\n\u201cReliance to act on Ms. Hardt\u2019s application by adequately\nconsidering all the evidence\u201d within 30 days; \u201c[o]therwise,\u201d it\nwarned, \u201cjudgment will be issued in favor of Ms. Hardt.\u201dId., at 49a.Reliance did as instructed. After conducting\nthat review, Reliance found Hardt eligible for long-term disability\nbenefits and paid her $55,250 in accrued, past-due benefits.Hardt then moved for attorney\u2019s fees and costs\nunder \u00a71132(g)(1). The District Court assessed her motion under the\nthree-step framework that governed fee requests in ERISA cases\nunder Circuit precedent. At step one of that framework, a district\ncourt asks whether the fee claimant is a \u201c\u00a0\u2018prevailing\nparty.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId., at 15a\u201316a (quotingMartinv.Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Virginia, Inc., 115\nF.\u00a03d 1201, 1210 (CA4 1997), and citingBuckhannon Board\n& Care Home, Inc.v.West Virginia Dept. of Health and\nHuman Resources,532 U. S. 598, 603 (2001)). If the fee\nclaimant qualifies as a prevailing party, the court proceeds to\nstep two and \u201cdetermin[es] whether an award of attorneys\u2019 fees is\nappropriate\u201d by examining \u201cfive factors.\u201d[Footnote 1] App. to Pet. for Cert. 16a. Finally, if\nthose five factors suggest that a fees award is appropriate, the\ncourt \u201cmust review the attorneys\u2019 fees and costs requested and\nlimit them to a reasonable amount.\u201dId., at 17a (citingHensleyv.Eckerhart,461 U. S. 424, 433\n(1983)).Applying that framework, the District Court\ngranted Hardt\u2019s motion. It first concluded that Hardt was a\nprevailing party because the court\u2019s remand order \u201csanctioned a\nmaterial change in the legal relationship of the parties by\nordering [Reliance] to conduct the type of review to which [Hardt]\nwas entitled.\u201dId., at 22a. The court recognized that the\norder did not \u201csanctio[n] a certain result on remand,\u201d but found\nthat it \u201cquite clearly expressed the consequences to [Reliance]\nwere it to fail to complete its reconsideration in an expeditious\nmanner.\u201dId., at 19a. Accordingly, the remand order\n\u201csignif[ied] that the court was displeased with the cursory review\nthat [Reliance] had initially given to [Hardt\u2019s] claim, but was\ninclined to reserve judgment and permit [Reliance] to conduct a\nproper review of all of the medical evidence.\u201dIbid.The\ncourt next concluded that a fees award was appropriate under the\nfive-factor test, seeid., at 22a\u201325a, and awarded $39,149\nin fees and costs,id., at 25a\u201330a.Reliance appealed the fees award, and the\nCourt of Appeals vacated the District Court\u2019s order. According to\nthe Court of Appeals, Hardt failed to satisfy the step-one\ninquiry\u2014i.e., she failed to establish that she was a\n\u201cprevailing party.\u201d In reaching that conclusion, the Court of\nAppeals relied on this Court\u2019s decision inBuckhannon,\nunder which a fee claimant qualifies as a \u201cprevailing party\u201d only\nif he has obtained an \u201c\u00a0\u2018enforceable judgmen[t] on the\nmerits\u2019\u00a0\u201d or a \u201c\u00a0\u2018court-ordered consent decre[e].\u2019\u00a0\u201d\n336 Fed. Appx. 332, 335 (CA4 2009)(per curiam)(quoting\n532 U. S., at 604). The Court of Appeals reasoned that because the\nremand order \u201cdid not require Reliance to award benefits to Hardt,\u201d\nit did \u201cnot constitute an \u2018enforceable judgment on the merits\u2019 asBuckhannonrequires,\u201d thus precluding Hardt from\nestablishing prevailing party status. 336 Fed. Appx., at 336\n(brackets omitted).Hardt filed a petition for a writ of\ncertiorari seeking review of two aspects of the Court of Appeals\u2019\njudgment. First, did the Court of Appeals correctly conclude that\n\u00a71132(g)(1) permits courts to award attorney\u2019s fees only to a\n\u201cprevailing party\u201d?[Footnote 2]\nSecond, did the Court of Appeals correctly identify the\ncircumstances under which a fee claimant is entitled to attorney\u2019s\nfees under \u00a71132(g)(1)? We granted certiorari. 558 U. S. ___\n(2010).IIWhether \u00a71132(g)(1) limits the\navailability of attorney\u2019s fees to a \u201cprevailing party\u201d is a\nquestion of statutory construction. As in all such cases, we begin\nby analyzing the statutory language, \u201cassum[ing] that the ordinary\nmeaning of that language accurately expresses the legislative\npurpose.\u201dGrossv.FBL Financial Services, Inc.,\n557 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 7) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). We must enforce plain and unambiguous statutory\nlanguage according to its terms.Carcieriv.Salazar, 555 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 7);Jimenezv.Quarterman, 555 U. S. ___, ___ (2009)\n(slip op., at 5).Section 1132(g)(1) provides:\u201cIn any action under this subchapter (other than an\naction described in paragraph (2)) by a participant, beneficiary,\nor fiduciary, the court in its discretion may allow a reasonable\nattorney\u2019s fee and costs of action to either party.\u201dThe words \u201cprevailing party\u201d do not appear in this\nprovision. Nor does anything else in \u00a71132(g)(1)\u2019s text purport to\nlimit the availability of attorney\u2019s fees to a \u201cprevailing party.\u201d\nInstead, \u00a71132(g)(1) expressly grants district courts \u201cdiscretion\u201d\nto award attorney\u2019s fees \u201ctoeitherparty.\u201d (Emphasis\nadded.)That language contrasts sharply with\n\u00a71132(g)(2), which governs the availability of attorney\u2019s fees in\nERISA actions under \u00a71145 (actions to recover delinquent employer\ncontributions to a multiemployer plan). In such cases, only\nplaintiffs who obtain \u201ca judgment in favor of the plan\u201d may seek\nattorney\u2019s fees. \u00a71132(g)(2)(D). The contrast between these two\nparagraphs makes clear that Congress knows how to impose express\nlimits on the availability of attorney\u2019s fees in ERISA cases.\nBecause Congress failed to include in \u00a71132(g)(1) an express\n\u201cprevailing party\u201d limit on the availability of attorney\u2019s fees,\nthe Court of Appeals\u2019 decision adding that term of art to a\nfee-shifting statute from which it is conspicuously absent more\nclosely resembles \u201cinvent[ing] a statute rather than interpret[ing]\none.\u201dPasquantinov.United States,544 U. S. 349, 359\n(2005) (internal quotation marks omitted).We see no reason to dwell any longer on this\nquestion, particularly given Reliance\u2019s concessions. See Brief for\nRespondent 9\u201310 (\u201cOn its face,\u201d \u00a71132(g)(1) \u201cdoes not expressly\ndemand, like so many statutes, that a claimant be a \u2018prevailing\nparty\u2019 before receiving attorney\u2019s fees\u201d). We therefore hold that a\nfee claimant need not be a \u201cprevailing party\u201d to be eligible for an\nattorney\u2019s fees award under \u00a71132(g)(1).IIIWe next consider the\ncircumstances under which a court may award attorney\u2019s fees\npursuant to \u00a71132(g)(1). \u201cOur basic point of reference\u201d when\nconsidering the award of attorney\u2019s fees is the bedrock principle\nknown as the \u201c\u00a0\u2018American Rule\u2019\u00a0\u201d: Each litigant pays his\nown attorney\u2019s fees, win or lose, unless a statute or contract\nprovides otherwise.Ruckelshaus, 463 U. S., at 683; seeid., at 683\u2013686;Alyeska Pipeline Service Co.v.Wilderness Society,421 U. S. 240, 247\n(1975);Buckhannon,supra, at 602\u2013603; see alsoPerduev.Kenny A., 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010)\n(slip op., at 5). Statutory changes to this rule take various\nforms. Most fee-shifting provisions permit a court to award\nattorney\u2019s fees only to a \u201cprevailing party.\u201d\u00a0[Footnote 3] Others permit a \u201csubstantially\nprevailing\u201d party\u00a0[Footnote\n4] or a \u201csuccessful\u201d litigant\u00a0[Footnote 5] to obtain fees. Still others authorize\ndistrict courts to award attorney\u2019s fees where\n\u201cappropriate,\u201d\u00a0[Footnote\n6] or simply vest district courts with \u201cdiscretion\u201d to award\nfees.[Footnote 7]Of those statutory deviations\nfrom the American Rule, we have most often considered statutes\ncontaining an express \u201cprevailing party\u201d requirement. See,e.g.,Texas State Teachers Assn.v.Garland\nIndependent School Dist.,489 U. S. 782, 792\u2013793\n(1989);Farrarv.Hobby,506 U. S. 103, 109\u2013114\n(1992);Buckhannon,supra, at 602\u2013606;Solev.Wyner,551 U. S. 74, 82\u201386\n(2007). Our \u201cprevailing party\u201d precedents, however, do not govern\nthe availability of fees awards under \u00a71132(g)(1), because this\nprovision does not limit the availability of attorney\u2019s fees to the\n\u201cprevailing party.\u201dSupra, at 8\u20139; see alsoGross,supra, at ___, (slip op., at 6)\n(cautioning courts \u201cconducting statutory interpretation \u2026 \u2018not to\napply rules applicable under one statute to a different statute\nwithout careful and critical examination\u2019\u00a0\u201d (quotingFederal Express Corp.v.Holowecki,552 U. S. 389, 393\n(2008))).Instead, we interpret \u00a71132(g)(1) in light of\nour precedents addressing statutory deviations from the American\nRule that do not limit attorney\u2019s fees awards to the \u201cprevailing\nparty.\u201d In that line of precedents,Ruckelshausis the\nprincipal case. There, the Court interpreted \u00a7307(f) of the Clean\nAir Act, which authorizes a court to award fees \u201cwhenever it\ndetermines that such an award is appropriate.\u201d 42 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a77607(f). We began by noting that because nothing in \u00a7307(f)\u2019s text\n\u201cclear[ly] show[ed]\u201d that Congress meant to abandon the American\nRule, 463 U. S., at 685, fee claimants must have achieved some\nlitigating success to be eligible for a fees award under that\nsection,id., at 686. We then concluded that by using the\nless stringent \u201cwhenever \u2026 appropriate\u201d standard instead of the\ntraditional \u201cprevailing party\u201d standard, Congress had \u201cexpand[ed]\nthe class of parties eligible for fees awards from prevailing\nparties topartially prevailingparties\u2014parties achievingsome success, even if not major success.\u201dId., at\n688. We thus held \u201cthat, absent some degree of success on the\nmerits by the claimant, it is not \u2018appropriate\u2019 for a federal court\nto award attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7307(f).\u201dId., at 694.Applying the interpretive approach we employed\ninRuckelshausto \u00a71132(g)(1), we first look to \u201cthe\nlanguage of the section,\u201did.,at 682, which unambiguously\nallows a court to award attorney\u2019s fees \u201cin its discretion \u2026 to\neither party,\u201d \u00a71132(g)(1). Statutes vesting judges with such broad\ndiscretion are well known in the law, particularly in the\nattorney\u2019s fees context. See,e.g.,n. 7,supra;see alsoPerdue, 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 14).Equally well known, however, is the fact that\na \u201cjudge\u2019s discretion is not unlimited.\u201dIbid.Consistent with Circuit precedent, the District\nCourt applied five factors to guide its discretion in deciding\nwhether to award attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a71132(g)(1). Seesupra, at 6, and n.\u00a01. Because these five factors\nbear no obvious relation to \u00a71132(g)(1)\u2019s text or to our\nfee-shifting jurisprudence, they are not required for channeling a\ncourt\u2019s discretion when awarding fees under this section.Instead,Ruckelshauslays down the\nproper markers to guide a court in exercising the discretion that\n\u00a71132(g)(1) grants. As in the statute at issue inRuckelshaus, Congress failed to indicate clearly in\n\u00a71132(g)(1) that it \u201cmeant to abandon historic fee-shifting\nprinciples and intuitive notions of fairness.\u201d 463 U. S., at 686.\nAccordingly, a fees claimant must show \u201csome degree of success on\nthe merits\u201d before a court may award attorney\u2019s fees under\n\u00a71132(g)(1),id., at 694. A claimant does not satisfy that\nrequirement by achieving \u201ctrivial success on the merits\u201d or a\n\u201cpurely procedural victor[y],\u201d but does satisfy it if the court can\nfairly call the outcome of the litigation some success on the\nmerits without conducting a \u201clengthy inquir[y] into the question\nwhether a particular party\u2019s success was \u2018substantial\u2019 or occurred\non a \u2018central issue.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId., at 688,\nn.\u00a09.[Footnote 8]Reliance essentially agrees that this standard\nshould govern fee requests under \u00a71132(g)(1), see Brief for\nRespondent 13\u201331, but argues that Hardt has not satisfied it.\nSpecifically, Reliance contends that a court order remanding an\nERISA claim for further consideration can never constitute \u201csome\nsuccess on the merits,\u201d even if such a remand results in an award\nof benefits. Seeid.,at 34\u201350.Reliance\u2019s argument misses the point, given\nthe facts of this case. Hardt persuaded the District Court to find\nthat \u201cthe plan administrator has failed to comply with the ERISA\nguidelines\u201d and \u201cthat Ms. Hardt did not get the kind of review to\nwhich she was entitled under applicable law.\u201d App. to Pet. for\nCert. 48a; see 29 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71133(2), 29 CFR \u00a72560.503\u20131(h)\n(2009). Although Hardt failed to win summary judgment on her\nbenefits claim, the District Court nevertheless found \u201ccompelling\nevidence that Ms. Hardt is totally disabled due to her neuropathy,\u201d\nand stated that it was \u201cinclined to rule in Ms. Hardt\u2019s favor\u201d on\nher benefits claim, but declined to do so before \u201cfirst giving\nReliance the chance to address the deficiencies in its\u201d statutorily\nmandated \u201cfull and fair review\u201d of that claim. App. to Pet. for\nCert. 48a; 29 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71133(2). Hardt thus obtained a\njudicial order instructing Reliance \u201cto act on Ms. Hardt\u2019s\napplication by adequately considering all the evidence\u201d within 30\ndays; \u201c[o]therwise, judgment will be issued in favor of Ms. Hardt.\u201d\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 49a. After Reliance conducted that\ncourt-ordered review, and consistent with the District Court\u2019s\nappraisal, Reliance reversed its decision and awarded Hardt the\nbenefits she sought. App. 120a\u2013123a.These facts establish that Hardt has achieved\nfar more than \u201ctrivial success on the merits\u201d or a \u201cpurely\nprocedural victory.\u201d Accordingly, she has achieved \u201csome success on\nthe merits,\u201d and the District Court properly exercised its\ndiscretion to award Hardt attorney\u2019s fees in this case. Because\nthese conclusions resolve this case, we need not decide today\nwhether a remand order, without more, constitutes \u201csome success on\nthe merits\u201d sufficient to make a party eligible for attorney\u2019s fees\nunder \u00a71132(g)(1).[Footnote\n9]*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*We reverse the judgment of the\nCourt of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit and remand this case for\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.Footnote 1These factors are: \u201c\u00a0\u2018(1) the degree of\nopposing parties\u2019 culpability or bad faith; (2) ability of opposing\nparties to satisfy an award of attorneys\u2019 fees; (3) whether an\naward of attorneys\u2019 fees against the opposing parties would deter\nother persons acting under similar circumstances; (4) whether the\nparties requesting attorneys\u2019 fees sought to benefit all\nparticipants and beneficiaries of an ERISA plan or to resolve a\nsignificant legal question regarding ERISA itself; and (5) the\nrelative merits of the parties\u2019 positions.\u2019\u00a0\u201d App. to Pet. for\nCert. 16a (quotingQuesinberryv.Life Ins. Co. of\nNorth Am.,987 F.\u00a02d 1017, 1029 (CA4 1993)).Footnote 2The Courts of Appeals are divided on this\nissue. Some (a few only tentatively) agree with the Court of\nAppeals\u2019 conclusion here that only prevailing parties are entitled\nto fees under \u00a71132(g)(1). See,e.g.,Cottrillv.Sparrow, Johnson & Ursillo, Inc., 100 F.\u00a03d 220,\n225 (CA1 1996) (\u201cCongress declared that, in any ERISA claim\nadvanced by a \u2018participant, beneficiary, or fiduciary, the court in\nits discretion may allow a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee\u2019to the\nprevailing party\u201d (emphasis added));Tatev.Long\nTerm Disability Plan for Salaried Employees of Champion Int\u2019l Corp.\n#506, 545 F.\u00a03d 555, 564 (CA7 2008) (\u201cIn analyzing\nwhether attorney\u2019s fees should be awarded to a \u2018prevailing party\u2019\nin an ERISA case, a court should consider whether the losing\nparty\u2019s position was justified an taken in good faith. However, we\nhave held that a claimant who is awarded a remand in an ERISA case\ngenerally is not a prevailing party in the truest sense of the\nterm\u201d (some internal quotation marks and citation omitted));Grahamv.Hartford Life and Accident Ins. Co.,\n501 F.\u00a03d 1153, 1162 (CA10 2007) (\u201cWe also afford certain\nweight to prevailing party status, even though we acknowledge that\nthe ERISA attorney\u2019s fees provision is not expressly directed at\nprevailing parties\u201d). Other Courts of Appeals have rejected or\ndisavowed that position. See,e.g.,Millerv.United Welfare Fund, 72 F.\u00a03d 1066, 1074 (CA2 1995);Gibbsv.Gibbs, 210 F.\u00a03d 491, 503 (CA5\n2000);Freemanv.Continental Ins. Co., 996\nF.\u00a02d 1116, 1119 (CA11 1993).Footnote 3See,e.g.,Buckhannon Board\n& Care Home, Inc.v.West Virginia Dept. of Health and\nHuman Resources,532 U. S. 598, 601\u2013603 (2001) (citing\nexamples);Ruckelshausv.Sierra Club,463 U. S. 680, 684, n.\u00a03 (1983)\n(same).Footnote 4Seeibid.,n.\u00a04 (citing\nexamples).Footnote 5See,e.g.,18 U.

S.\u00a0C. \u00a72000aa\u20136(f).Footnote 8We do not foreclose the possibility that once\na claimant has satisfied this requirement, and thus becomes\neligible for a fees award under \u00a71132(g)(1), a court may consider\nthe five factors adopted by the Court of Appeals, see n.\u00a01,supra, in deciding whether to award attorney\u2019s fees.Footnote 9Reliance has not preserved any separate\nobjection to the reasonableness of the amount of fees awarded.
