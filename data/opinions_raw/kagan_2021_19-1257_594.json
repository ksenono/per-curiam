It marries two great ideals:\ndemocracy and racial equality. And it dedicates our country to\ncarrying them out. Section 2, the provision at issue here,\nguarantees that members of every racial group will have equal\nvoting opportunities. Citizens of every race will have the same\nshot to participate in the political process and to elect\nrepresentatives of their choice. They will all own our democracy\ntogether\u2014no one more and no one less than any other.If a single statute reminds us of the worst of\nAmerica, it is the Voting Rights Act. Because it was\u2014and remains\u2014so\nnecessary. Because a century after the Civil War was fought, at the\ntime of the Act\u2019s passage, the promise of political equality\nremained a distant dream for African American citizens. Because\nStates and localities continually \u201ccontriv[ed] new rules,\u201d mostly\nneutral on their face but discriminatory in operation, to keep\nminority voters from the polls.South Carolinav.Katzenbach,383 U.S.\n301, 335 (1966). Because \u201cCongress had reason to suppose\u201d that\nStates would \u201ctry similar maneuvers in the future\u201d\u2014\u201cpour[ing] old\npoison into new bottles\u201d to suppress minority votes.Ibid.;Renov.Bossier Parish School Bd.,528 U.S.\n320, 366 (2000) (Souter, J., concurring in part and dissenting\nin part). Because Congress has been proved right.The Voting Rights Act is ambitious, in both goal\nand scope. When President Lyndon Johnson sent the bill to Congress,\nten days after John Lewis led marchers across the Edmund Pettus\nBridge, he explained that it was \u201ccarefully drafted to meet its\nobjective\u2014the end of discrimination in voting in America.\u201d\nH.\u00a0R. Doc. No. 120, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., 1\u20132 (1965). He was\nright about how the Act\u2019s drafting reflected its aim. \u201cThe end of\ndiscrimination in voting\u201d is a far-reaching goal. And the Voting\nRights Act\u2019s text is just as far-reaching. A later amendment,\nadding the provision at issue here, became necessary when this\nCourt construed the statute too narrowly. And in the last decade,\nthis Court assailed the Act again, undoing its vital Section 5. SeeShelby Countyv.Holder,570\nU.S. 529(2013). But Section 2 of the Act remains, as written,\nas expansive as ever\u2014demanding that every citizen of this country\npossess a right at once grand and obvious: the right to an equal\nopportunity to vote.Today, the Court undermines Section 2 and the\nright it provides. The majority fears that the statute Congress\nwrote is too \u201cradical\u201d\u2014that it will invalidate too many state\nvoting laws. Seeante, at 21, 25. So the majority writes its\nown set of rules, limiting Section 2 from multiple directions. Seeante, at 16\u201319. Wherever it can, the majority gives a\ncramped reading to broad language. And then it uses that reading to\nuphold two election laws from Arizona that discriminate against\nminority voters. I could say\u2014and will in the following pages\u2014that\nthis is not how the Court is supposed to interpret and apply\nstatutes. But that ordinary critique woefully undersells the\nproblem. What is tragic here is that the Court has (yet again)\nrewritten\u2014in order to weaken\u2014a statute that stands as a monument to\nAmerica\u2019s greatness, and protects against its basest impulses. What\nis tragic is that the Court has damaged a statute designed to bring\nabout \u201cthe end of discrimination in voting.\u201d I respectfully\ndissent.IThe Voting Rights Act of 1965 is an\nextraordinary law. Rarely has a statute required so much sacrifice\nto ensure its passage. Never has a statute done more to advance the\nNation\u2019s highest ideals. And few laws are more vital in the current\nmoment. Yet in the last decade, this Court has treated no statute\nworse. To take the measure of today\u2019s harm, a look to the Act\u2019s\npast must come first. The idea is not to recount, as the majority\nhurriedly does, some bygone era of voting discrimination. Seeante, at 2\u20133. It is instead to describe the electoral\npractices that the Act targets\u2014and to show the high stakes of the\npresent controversy.ADemocratic ideals in America got off to a\nglorious start; democratic practice not so much. The Declaration of\nIndependence made an awe-inspiring promise: to institute a\ngovernment \u201cderiving [its] just powers from the consent of the\ngoverned.\u201d But for most of the Nation\u2019s first century, that pledge\nran to white men only. The earliest state election laws excluded\nfrom the franchise African Americans, Native Americans, women, and\nthose without property. See A. Keyssar, The Right To Vote: The\nContested History of Democracy in the United States 8\u201321, 54\u201360\n(2000). In 1855, on the precipice of the Civil War, only five\nStates permitted African Americans to vote.Id., at 55. And\nat the federal level, our Court\u2019s most deplorable holding made sure\nthat no black people could enter the voting booth. SeeDred\nScottv.Sandford, 19 How. 393 (1857).But the \u201cAmerican ideal of political equality\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. could not forever tolerate the limitation of the\nright to vote\u201d to whites only.Mobilev.Bolden,446 U.S.\n55, 103\u2013104 (1980) (Marshall, J., dissenting). And a civil war,\ndedicated to ensuring \u201cgovernment of the people, by the people, for\nthe people,\u201d brought constitutional change. In 1870, after a\nhard-fought battle over ratification, the Fifteenth Amendment\ncarried the Nation closer to its founding aspirations. \u201cThe right\nof citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or\nabridged by the United States or by any State on account of race,\ncolor, or previous condition of servitude.\u201d Those words promised to\nenfranchise millions of black citizens who only a decade earlier\nhad been slaves. Frederick Douglass held that the Amendment \u201cmeans\nthat we are placed upon an equal footing with all other men\u201d\u2014that\nwith the vote, \u201cliberty is to be the right of all.\u201d 4 The Frederick\nDouglass Papers 270\u2013271 (J. Blassingame & J. McKivigan eds.\n1991). President Grant had seen much blood spilled in the Civil\nWar; now he spoke of the fruits of that sacrifice. In a\nself-described \u201cunusual\u201d message to Congress, he heralded the\nFifteenth Amendment as \u201ca measure of grander importance than any\nother one act of the kind from the foundation of our free\nGovernment\u201d\u2014as \u201cthe most important event that has occurred since\nthe nation came into life.\u201d Ulysses S. Grant, Message to the Senate\nand House of Representatives (Mar. 30, 1870), in 7 Compilation of\nthe Messages and Papers of the Presidents 1789\u20131897, pp.\u00a055\u201356\n(J. Richardson ed. 1898).Momentous as the Fifteenth Amendment was,\ncelebration of its achievements soon proved premature. The\nAmendment\u2019s guarantees \u201cquickly became dead letters in much of the\ncountry.\u201d Foner, The Strange Career of the Reconstruction\nAmendments, 108 Yale L.\u00a0J. 2003, 2007 (1999). African\nAmericans daring to go to the polls often \u201cmet with coordinated\nintimidation and violence.\u201dNorthwest Austin Municipal Util.Dist.No.Onev.Holder,557 U.S.\n193, 218\u2013219 (2009) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment in part\nand dissenting in part). And almost immediately, legislators\ndiscovered that bloodless actions could also suffice to limit the\nelectorate to white citizens. Many States, especially in the South,\nsuppressed the black vote through a dizzying array of methods:\nliteracy tests, poll taxes, registration requirements, and property\nqualifications. SeeKatzenbach, 383 U.\u00a0S., at 310\u2013312.\nMost of those laws, though facially neutral, gave enough discretion\nto election officials to prevent significant effects on poor or\nuneducated whites. The idea, as one Virginia representative put it,\nwas \u201cto disfranchise every negro that [he] could disfranchise,\u201d and\n\u201cas few white people as possible.\u201d Keyssar 113. Decade after decade\nafter decade, election rules blocked African Americans\u2014and in some\nStates, Hispanics and Native Americans too\u2014from making use of the\nballot. SeeOregonv.Mitchell,400 U.S.\n112, 132 (1970) (opinion of Black, J.) (discussing treatment of\nnon-black groups). By 1965, only 27% of black Georgians, 19% of\nblack Alabamians, and 7%\u2014yes, 7%\u2014of black Mississippians were\nregistered to vote. See C. Bullock, R. Gaddie, & J. Wert, The\nRise and Fall of the Voting Rights Act 23 (2016).The civil rights movement, and the events of a\nsingle Bloody Sunday, created pressure for change. Selma was the\nheart of an Alabama county whose 15,000 black citizens included, in\n1961, only 156 on the voting rolls. See D. Garrow, Protest at Selma\n31 (1978). In the first days of 1965, the city became the epicenter\nof demonstrations meant to force Southern election officials to\nregister African American voters. As weeks went by without results,\norganizers announced a march from Selma to Birmingham. On March 7,\nsome 600 protesters, led by future Congressman John Lewis, sought\nto cross the Edmund Pettus Bridge. State troopers in riot gear\nresponded brutally: \u201cTurning their nightsticks horizontally, they\nrushed into the crowd, knocking people over like bowling pins.\u201d G.\nMay, Bending Toward Justice 87 (2013). Then came men on horseback,\n\u201cswinging their clubs and ropes like cowboys driving cattle to\nmarket.\u201dIbid. The protestors were beaten, knocked\nunconscious, and bloodied. Lewis\u2019s skull was fractured. \u201cI thought\nI was going to die on this bridge,\u201d he later recalled. Rojas, Selma\nHelped Define John Lewis\u2019s Life, N.\u00a0Y. Times, July 28,\n2020.A galvanized country responded. Ten days after\nthe Selma march, President Johnson wrote to Congress proposing\nlegislation to \u201chelp rid the Nation of racial discrimination in\nevery aspect of the electoral process and thereby insure the right\nof all to vote.\u201d H.\u00a0R. Doc. No. 120, at 1. (To his attorney\ngeneral, Johnson was still more emphatic: \u201cI want you to write the\ngoddamnedest toughest voting rights act that you can devise.\u201d H.\nRaines, My Soul Is Rested 337 (1983).) And in August 1965, after\nthe bill\u2019s supporters overcame a Senate filibuster, Johnson signed\nthe Voting Rights Act into law. Echoing Grant\u2019s description of the\nFifteenth Amendment, Johnson called the statute \u201cone of the most\nmonumental laws in the entire history of American freedom.\u201d Public\nPapers of the Presidents, Lyndon B. Johnson, Vol. 2, Aug. 6, 1965,\np.\u00a0841 (1966) (Johnson Papers).\u201cAfter a century\u2019s failure to fulfill the\npromise\u201d of the Fifteenth Amendment, \u201cpassage of the VRA finally\nled to signal improvement.\u201dShelby County, 570 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 562 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting). In the five years after the\nstatute\u2019s passage, almost as many African Americans registered to\nvote in six Southern States as in the entire century before 1965.\nSee Davidson, The Voting Rights Act: A Brief History, in\nControversies in Minority Voting 21 (B. Grofman & C. Davidson\neds. 1992). The crudest attempts to block voting access, like\nliteracy tests and poll taxes, disappeared. Legislatures often\nreplaced those vote denial schemes with new measures\u2014mostly to do\nwith districting\u2014designed to dilute the impact of minority votes.\nBut the Voting Rights Act, operating for decades at full strength,\nstopped many of those measures too. See,e.g.,Chisomv.Roemer,501 U.S.\n380(1991);Allenv.State Bd.of\nElections,393 U.S.\n544(1969). As a famed dissent assessed the situation about a\nhalf-century after the statute\u2019s enactment: The Voting Rights Act\nhad become \u201cone of the most consequential, efficacious, and amply\njustified exercises of federal legislative power in our Nation\u2019s\nhistory.\u201dShelby County, 570 U.\u00a0S., at 562 (Ginsburg,\nJ., dissenting).[1]BYet efforts to suppress the minority vote\ncontinue. No one would know this from reading the majority opinion.\nIt hails the \u201cgood news\u201d that legislative efforts had mostly\nshifted by the 1980s from vote denial to vote dilution.Ante, at 7. And then it moves on to other matters, as though\nthe Voting Rights Act no longer has a problem to address\u2014as though\nonce literacy tests and poll taxes disappeared, so too did efforts\nto curb minority voting. But as this Court recognized about a\ndecade ago, \u201cracial discrimination and racially polarized voting\nare not ancient history.\u201dBartlettv.Strickland,556 U.S.\n1, 25 (2009). Indeed, the problem of voting discrimination has\nbecome worse since that time\u2014in part because of what this Court did\ninShelby County. Weaken the Voting Rights Act, and\npredictable consequences follow: yet a further generation of voter\nsuppression laws.Much of the Voting Rights Act\u2019s success lay in\nits capacity to meet ever-new forms of discrimination. Experience\nshowed that \u201c[w]henever one form of voting discrimination was\nidentified and prohibited, others sprang up in its place.\u201dShelby County, 570 U.\u00a0S., at 560 (Ginsburg, J.,\ndissenting). Combating those efforts was like \u201cbattling the\nHydra\u201d\u2014or to use a less cultured reference, like playing a game of\nwhack-a-mole.Ibid. So Congress, in Section 5 of the Act,\ngave the Department of Justice authority to review all new rules\ndevised by jurisdictions with a history of voter suppression\u2014and to\nblock any that would have discriminatory effects. See 52\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a710304(a)\u2013(b). In that way, the Act would\nprevent the use of new, more nuanced methods to restrict the voting\nopportunities of non-white citizens.And for decades, Section 5 operated as intended.\nBetween 1965 and 2006, the Department stopped almost 1200 voting\nlaws in covered areas from taking effect. SeeShelby County,\n570 U.\u00a0S., at 571 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting). Some of those\nlaws used districting to dilute minority voting strength\u2014making\nsure that the votes of minority citizens would carry less weight\nthan the votes of whites in electing candidates. Other laws, even\nif facially neutral, disproportionately curbed the ability of\nnon-white citizens to cast a ballot at all. So, for example, a\njurisdiction might require forms of identification that those\nvoters were less likely to have; or it might limit voting places\nand times convenient for those voters; or it might purge its voter\nrolls through mechanisms especially likely to ensnare them. Seeid., at 574\u2013575. In reviewing mountains of such evidence in\n2006, Congress saw a continuing need for Section 5. Although\n\u201cdiscrimination today is more subtle than the visible methods used\nin 1965,\u201d Congress found, it still produces \u201cthe same [effects],\nnamely a diminishing of the minority community\u2019s ability to fully\nparticipate in the electoral process.\u201d H.\u00a0R. Rep. No. 109\u2013478,\np.\u00a06 (2006). Congress thus reauthorized the preclearance\nscheme for 25 years.But this Court took a different view. Finding\nthat \u201c[o]ur country has changed,\u201d the Court saw only limited\ninstances of voting discrimination\u2014and so no further need for\npreclearance.Shelby County, 570 U.\u00a0S., at 547\u2013549,\n557. Displacing Congress\u2019s contrary judgment, the Court struck down\nthe coverage formula essential to the statute\u2019s operation. The\nlegal analysis offered was perplexing: The Court based its decision\non a \u201cprinciple of equal [state] sovereignty\u201d that a prior decision\nof ours had rejected\u2014and that has not made an appearance since.Id., at 544 (majority opinion); seeid., at 587\u2013588\n(Ginsburg, J., dissenting). Worse yet was the Court\u2019s blithe\nconfidence in assessing what was needed and what was not. \u201c[T]hings\nhave changed dramatically,\u201d the Court reiterated,id., at\n547: The statute that was once a necessity had become an\nimposition. But how did the majority know there was nothing more\nfor Section 5 to do\u2014that the (undoubted) changes in the country\nwent so far as to make the provision unnecessary? It didn\u2019t, as\nJustice Ginsburg explained in dissent. The majority\u2019s faith that\ndiscrimination was almost gone derived, at least in part, from the\nsuccess of Section 5\u2014from its record of blocking discriminatory\nvoting schemes. Discarding Section 5 because those schemes had\ndiminished was \u201clike throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm\nbecause you are not getting wet.\u201dId., at 590.The rashness of the act soon became evident.\nOnce Section 5\u2019s strictures came off, States and localities put in\nplace new restrictive voting laws, with foreseeably adverse effects\non minority voters. On the very dayShelby Countyissued,\nTexas announced that it would implement a strict\nvoter-identification requirement that had failed to clear Section\n5. See Elmendorf & Spencer, Administering Section 2 of the\nVoting Rights Act AfterShelby County, 115 Colum. L. Rev.\n2143, 2145\u20132146 (2015). Other States\u2014Alabama, Virginia,\nMississippi\u2014fell like dominoes, adopting measures similarly\nvulnerable to preclearance review. Seeibid. The North\nCarolina Legislature, starting work the day afterShelby\nCounty, enacted a sweeping election bill eliminating same-day\nregistration, forbidding out-of-precinct voting, and reducing early\nvoting, including souls-to-the-polls Sundays. (That law went too\nfar even without Section 5: A court struck it down because the\nState\u2019s legislators had a racially discriminatory purpose.North\nCarolina State Conference of NAACPv.McCrory, 831 F.3d\n204 (CA4 2016).) States and localities redistricted\u2014drawing new\nboundary lines or replacing neighborhood-based seats with at-large\nseats\u2014in ways guaranteed to reduce minority representation. See\nElmendorf, 115 Colum. L. Rev., at 2146. And jurisdictions closed\npolling places in mostly minority areas, enhancing an already\npronounced problem. See Brief for Leadership Conference on Civil\nand Human Rights et\u00a0al. asAmici Curiae14\u201315 (listing\nclosure schemes); Pettigrew, The Racial Gap in Wait Times, 132 Pol.\nSci. Q. 527, 527 (2017) (finding that lines in minority precincts\nare twice as long as in white ones, and that a minority voter is\nsix times more likely to wait more than an hour).[2]And that was just the first wave of\npost-Shelby Countylaws. In recent months, State after State\nhas taken up or enacted legislation erecting new barriers to\nvoting. See Brennan Center for Justice, Voting Laws Roundup: May\n2021 (online source archived at www.supremecourt.gov) (compiling\nlegislation). Those laws shorten the time polls are open, both on\nElection Day and before. They impose new prerequisites to voting by\nmail, and shorten the windows to apply for and return mail ballots.\nThey make it harder to register to vote, and easier to purge voters\nfrom the rolls. Two laws even ban handing out food or water to\nvoters standing in line. Some of those restrictions may be lawful\nunder the Voting Rights Act. But chances are that some have the\nkind of impact the Act was designed to prevent\u2014that they make the\npolitical process less open to minority voters than to others.So the Court decides this Voting Rights Act case\nat a perilous moment for the Nation\u2019s commitment to equal\ncitizenship. It decides this case in an era of voting-rights\nretrenchment\u2014when too many States and localities are restricting\naccess to voting in ways that will predictably deprive members of\nminority groups of equal access to the ballot box. If \u201cany racial\ndiscrimination in voting is too much,\u201d as theShelby CountyCourt recited, then the Act still has much to do. 570 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 557. Or more precisely, the fraction of the Act remaining\u2014the\nAct as diminished by the Court\u2019s hand. Congress never meant for\nSection 2 to bear all of the weight of the Act\u2019s commitments. That\nprovision looks to courts, not to the Executive Branch, to restrain\ndiscriminatory voting practices. And litigation is an\nafter-the-fact remedy, incapable of providing relief until an\nelection\u2014usually, more than one election\u2014has come and gone. Seeid., at 572 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting). So Section 2 was\nsupposed to be a back-up, for all its sweep and power. But afterShelby County, the vitality of Section 2\u2014a \u201cpermanent,\nnationwide ban on racial discrimination in voting\u201d\u2014matters more\nthan ever.Id., at 557 (majority opinion). For afterShelby County, Section 2 is what voters have left.IISection 2, as drafted, is well-equipped to\nmeet the challenge. Congress meant to eliminate all \u201cdiscriminatory\nelection systems or practices which operate, designedly or\notherwise, to minimize or cancel out the voting strength and\npolitical effectiveness of minority groups.\u201d S. Rep. No. 97\u2013417,\np.\u00a028 (1982) (S.\u00a0Rep.). And that broad intent is manifest\nin the provision\u2019s broad text. As always, this Court\u2019s task is to\nread that language as Congress wrote it\u2014to give the section all the\nscope and potency Congress drafted it to have. So I start by\nshowing how Section 2\u2019s text requires courts to eradicate voting\npractices that make it harder for members of some races than of\nothers to cast a vote, unless such a practice is necessary to\nsupport a strong state interest. I then show how far from that text\nthe majority strays. Its analysis permits exactly the kind of vote\nsuppression that Section 2, by its terms, rules out of bounds.ASection 2, as relevant here, has two\ninterlocking parts. Subsection (a) states the law\u2019s basic\nprohibition:\u201cNo voting qualification or prerequisite\nto voting or standard, practice, or procedure shall be imposed or\napplied by any State or political subdivision in a manner which\nresults in a denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen of\nthe United States to vote on account of race or color.\u201d 52\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a710301(a).Subsection (b) then tells courts how to apply\nthat bar\u2014or otherwise said, when to find that an infringement of\nthe voting right has occurred:\u201cA violation of subsection (a) is\nestablished if, based on the totality of circumstances, it is shown\nthat the political processes leading to nomination or election in\nthe State or political subdivision are not equally open to\nparticipation by members of [a given race] in that [those] members\nhave less opportunity than other members of the electorate to\nparticipate in the political process and to elect representatives\nof their choice.\u201d \u00a710301(b).[3]Those provisions have a great many words, and I\naddress them further below. But their essential import is plain:\nCourts are to strike down voting rules that contribute to a racial\ndisparity in the opportunity to vote, taking all the relevant\ncircumstances into account.The first thing to note about Section 2 is how\nfar its prohibitory language sweeps. The provision bars any \u201cvoting\nqualification,\u201d any \u201cprerequisite to voting,\u201d or any \u201cstandard,\npractice, or procedure\u201d that \u201cresults in a denial or abridgement of\nthe right\u201d to \u201cvote on account of race.\u201d The overlapping list of\ncovered state actions makes clear that Section 2 extends to every\nkind of voting or election rule. Congress carved out nothing\npertaining to \u201cvoter qualifications or the manner in which\nelections are conducted.\u201dHolderv.Hall,512 U.S.\n874, 922 (1994) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment). So, for\nexample, the provision \u201ccovers all manner of registration\nrequirements, the practices surrounding registration,\u201d the\n\u201clocations of polling places, the times polls are open, the use of\npaper ballots as opposed to voting machines, and other similar\naspects of the voting process that might be manipulated to deny any\ncitizen the right to cast a ballot and have it properly counted.\u201dIbid. All those rules and more come within the statute\u2014so\nlong as they result in a race-based \u201cdenial or abridgement\u201d of the\nvoting right. And the \u201cdenial or abridgement\u201d phrase speaks broadly\ntoo. \u201c[A]bridgment necessarily means something more subtle and less\ndrastic than the complete denial of the right to cast a ballot,\ndenial being separately forbidden.\u201dBossier, 528 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 359 (Souter, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). It\nmeans to \u201ccurtail,\u201d rather than take away, the voting right.\nAmerican Heritage Dictionary 4 (1969).The \u201cresults in\u201d language, connecting the\ncovered voting rules to the prohibited voting abridgement, tells\ncourts that they are to focus on the law\u2019s effects. Rather than\nhinge liability on state officials\u2019 motives, Congress made it ride\non their actions\u2019 consequences. That decision was as considered as\nconsidered comes. This Court, as the majority notes, had construed\nthe original Section 2 to apply to facially neutral voting\npractices \u201conly if [they were] motivated by a discriminatory\npurpose.\u201dBolden, 446 U.\u00a0S., at 62; seeante, at\n5. Congress enacted the current Section 2 to reverse that\noutcome\u2014to make clear that \u201cresults\u201d alone could lead to liability.\nAn intent test, the Senate Report explained, \u201casks the wrong\nquestion.\u201d S. Rep., at 36. If minority citizens \u201care denied a fair\nopportunity to participate,\u201d then \u201cthe system should be changed,\nregardless of\u00a0\u201d what \u201cmotives were in an official\u2019s mind.\u201dIbid. Congress also saw an intent test as imposing \u201can\ninordinately difficult burden for plaintiffs.\u201dIbid. Even if\nstate actors had purposefully discriminated, they would likely be\n\u201cab[le] to offer a non-racial rationalization,\u201d supported by \u201ca\nfalse trail\u201d of \u201cofficial resolutions\u201d and \u201cother legislative\nhistory eschewing any racial motive.\u201dId., at 37. So only a\nresults-focused statute could prevent States from finding ways to\nabridge minority citizens\u2019 voting rights.But when to conclude\u2014looking to effects, not\npurposes\u2014that a denial or abridgment has occurred? Again, answering\nthat question is subsection (b)\u2019s function. Seesupra, at\n12\u201313. It teaches that a violation is established when, \u201cbased on\nthe totality of circumstances,\u201d a State\u2019s electoral system is \u201cnot\nequally open\u201d to members of a racial group. And then the subsection\ntells us what that means. A system is not equally open if members\nof one race have \u201cless opportunity\u201d than others to cast votes, to\nparticipate in politics, or to elect representatives. The key\ndemand, then, is for equal political opportunity across races.That equal \u201copportunity\u201d is absent when a law or\npractice makes it harder for members of one racial group, than for\nothers, to cast ballots. When Congress amended Section 2, the word\n\u201copportunity\u201d meant what it also does today: \u201ca favorable or\nadvantageous combination of circumstances\u201d for some action. See\nAmerican Heritage Dictionary, at 922. In using that word, Congress\nmade clear that the Voting Rights Act does not demand equal\noutcomes. If members of different races have the same opportunity\nto vote, but go to the ballot box at different rates, then so be\nit\u2014that is their preference, and Section 2 has nothing to say. But\nif a law produces different voting opportunities across races\u2014if it\nestablishes rules and conditions of political participation that\nare less favorable (or advantageous) for one racial group than for\nothers\u2014then Section 2 kicks in. It applies, in short, whenever the\nlaw makes it harder for citizens of one race than of others to cast\na vote.[4]And that is so even if (as is usually true) the\nlaw does not single out any race, but instead is facially neutral.\nSuppose, as Justice Scalia once did, that a county has a law\nlimiting \u201cvoter registration [to] only three hours one day a week.\u201dChisom, 501 U.\u00a0S., at 408 (dissenting opinion). And\nsuppose that policy makes it \u201cmore difficult for blacks to register\nthan whites\u201d\u2014say, because the jobs African Americans\ndisproportionately hold make it harder to take time off in that\nwindow.Ibid. Those citizens, Justice Scalia concluded,\nwould then \u201chave less opportunity \u2018to participate in the political\nprocess\u2019 than whites, and \u00a72 would therefore be violated.\u201dIbid. (emphasis deleted). In enacting Section 2, Congress\ndocumented many similar (if less extreme) facially neutral\nrules\u2014\u201cregistration requirements,\u201d \u201cvoting and registration hours,\u201d\nvoter \u201cpurging\u201d policies, and so forth\u2014that create disparities in\nvoting opportunities. S. Rep., at 10, n.\u00a022; H.\u00a0R. Rep.\nNo. 97\u2013227, pp.\u00a011\u201317 (1981) (H.\u00a0R. Rep.). Those laws,\nCongress thought, would violate Section 2, though they were not\nfacially discriminatory, because they gave voters of different\nraces unequal access to the political process.Congress also made plain, in calling for a\ntotality-of- circumstances inquiry, that equal voting opportunity\nis a function of both law and background conditions\u2014in other words,\nthat a voting rule\u2019s validity depends on how the rule operates in\nconjunction with facts on the ground. \u201c[T]otality review,\u201d this\nCourt has explained, stems from Congress\u2019s recognition of \u201cthe\ndemonstrated ingenuity of state and local governments in hobbling\nminority voting power.\u201dJohnsonv.De Grandy,512 U.S.\n997, 1018 (1994). Sometimes, of course, state actions overtly\ntarget a single race: For example, Congress was acutely aware, in\namending Section 2, of the elimination of polling places in African\nAmerican neighborhoods. See S.\u00a0Rep., at 10, 11, and\nn.\u00a022; H.\u00a0R. Rep., at 17, 35. But sometimes government\nofficials enact facially neutral laws that leverage\u2014and become\ndiscriminatory by dint of\u2014pre-existing social and economic\nconditions. The classic historical cases are literacy tests and\npoll taxes. A more modern example is the one Justice Scalia gave,\nof limited registration hours. Congress knew how those laws worked:\nIt saw that \u201cinferior education, poor employment opportunities, and\nlow incomes\u201d\u2014all conditions often correlated with race\u2014could turn\neven an ordinary-seeming election rule into an effective barrier to\nminority voting in certain circumstances.Thornburgv.Gingles,478 U.S.\n30, 69 (1986) (plurality opinion). So Congress demanded, as\nthis Court has recognized, \u201can intensely local appraisal\u201d of a\nrule\u2019s impact\u2014\u201ca searching practical evaluation of the \u2018past and\npresent reality.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId., at 79;De Grandy, 512\nU.\u00a0S., at 1018 (quoting S.\u00a0Rep., at 30). \u201cThe essence of\na \u00a72 claim,\u201d we have said, is that an election law \u201cinteracts with\nsocial and historical conditions\u201d in a particular place to cause\nrace-based inequality in voting opportunity.Gingles, 478\nU.\u00a0S., at 47 (majority opinion). That interaction is what the\ntotality inquiry is mostly designed to discover.At the same time, the totality inquiry enables\ncourts to take into account strong state interests supporting an\nelection rule. An all-things-considered inquiry, we have explained,\nis by its nature flexible. SeeDe Grandy, 512 U.\u00a0S., at\n1018. On the one hand, it allows no \u201csafe harbor[s]\u201d for election\nrules resulting in discrimination.Ibid. On the other hand,\nit precludes automatic condemnation of those rules. Among the\n\u201cbalance of considerations\u201d a court is to weigh is a State\u2019s need\nfor the challenged policy.Houston Lawyers\u2019 Assn. v.Attorney General of Tex.,501 U.S.\n419, 427 (1991). But in making that assessment of state\ninterests, a court must keep in mind\u2014just as Congress did\u2014the ease\nof \u201coffer[ing] a non-racial rationalization\u201d for even blatantly\ndiscriminatory laws. S. Rep., at 37; seesupra, at 14. State\ninterests do not get accepted on faith. And even a genuine and\nstrong interest will not suffice if a plaintiff can prove that it\ncan be accomplished in a less discriminatory way. As we have put\nthe point before: When a less racially biased law would not\n\u201csignificantly impair[\u00a0] the State\u2019s interest,\u201d the\ndiscriminatory election rule must fall.Houston Lawyers\u2019\nAssn., 501 U.\u00a0S., at 428.[5]So the text of Section 2, as applied in our\nprecedents, tells us the following, every part of which speaks to\nthe ambition of Congress\u2019s action. Section 2 applies to any voting\nrule, of any kind. The provision prohibits not just the denial but\nalso the abridgment of a citizen\u2019s voting rights on account of\nrace. The inquiry is focused on effects: It asks not about why\nstate officials enacted a rule, but about whether that rule results\nin racial discrimination. The discrimination that is of concern is\ninequality of voting opportunity. That kind of discrimination can\narise from facially neutral (not just targeted) rules. There is a\nSection 2 problem when an election rule, operating against the\nbackdrop of historical, social, and economic conditions, makes it\nharder for minority citizens than for others to cast ballots. And\nstrong state interests may save an otherwise discriminatory rule,\nbut only if that rule is needed to achieve them\u2014that is, only if a\nless discriminatory rule will not attain the State\u2019s goal.That is a lot of law to apply in a Section 2\ncase. Real law\u2014the kind created by Congress. (A strange thing, to\nhear about it all only in a dissent.)[6] None of this law threatens to \u201ctake down,\u201d as the\nmajority charges, the mass of state and local election rules.Ante, at 25. Here is the flipside of what I have said above,\nnow from the plaintiff\u00a0\u2019s perspective: Section 2 demands proof\nof a statistically significant racial disparity in electoral\nopportunities (not outcomes) resulting from a law not needed to\nachieve a government\u2019s legitimate goals. That showing is hardly\ninsubstantial; and as a result, Section 2 vote denial suits do not\noften succeed (even with lower courts applying the law as written,\nnot the majority\u2019s new, concocted version). See Brief for State and\nLocal Election Officials asAmici Curiae15 (finding only\nnine winning cases sinceShelby County, each involving \u201can\nintensely local appraisal\u201d of a \u201ccontroversial polic[y] in specific\nplaces\u201d). But Section 2 was indeed meant to do something\nimportant\u2014crucial to the operation of our democracy. The provision\ntells courts\u2014however \u201cradical\u201d the majority might find the idea,ante, at 25\u2014to eliminate facially neutral (as well as\ntargeted) electoral rules that unnecessarily create inequalities of\naccess to the political process. That is the very project of the\nstatute, as conceived and as written\u2014and now as damaged by this\nCourt.BThe majority\u2019s opinion mostly inhabits a\nlaw-free zone. It congratulates itself in advance for giving\nSection 2\u2019s text \u201ccareful consideration.\u201dAnte, at 14. And\nthen it leaves that language almost wholly behind. Seeante,\nat 14\u201321. (Every once in a while, when its lawmaking threatens to\nleap off the page, it thinks to sprinkle in a few random statutory\nwords.) So too the majority barely mentions this Court\u2019s precedents\nconstruing Section 2\u2019s text. On both those counts, you can see why.\nAs just described, Section 2\u2019s language is broad. Seesupra,\nat 12\u201320. To read it fairly, then, is to read it broadly. And to\nread it broadly is to do much that the majority is determined to\navoid. So the majority ignores the sweep of Section 2\u2019s prohibitory\nlanguage. It fails to note Section 2\u2019s application to every\nconceivable kind of voting rule. It neglects to address the\nprovision\u2019s concern with how those rules may \u201cabridge[\u00a0],\u201d not\njust deny, minority citizens\u2019 voting rights. It declines to\nconsider Congress\u2019s use of an effects test, rather than a purpose\ntest, to assess the rules\u2019 legality. Nor does the majority\nacknowledge the force of Section 2\u2019s implementing provision. The\nmajority says as little as possible about what it means for voting\nto be \u201cequally open,\u201d or for voters to have an equal \u201copportunity\u201d\nto cast a ballot. Seeante, at 14\u201315. It only grudgingly\naccepts\u2014and then apparently forgets\u2014that the provision applies to\nfacially neutral laws with discriminatory consequences. Compareante, at 22, withante, at 25. And it hints that as\nlong as a voting system is sufficiently \u201copen,\u201d it need not be\nequally so. Seeante, at 16, 18. In sum, the majority skates\nover the strong words Congress drafted to accomplish its equally\nstrong purpose: ensuring that minority citizens can access the\nelectoral system as easily as whites.[7]The majority instead founds its decision on a\nlist of mostly made-up factors, at odds with Section 2 itself. To\nexcuse this unusual free-form exercise, the majority notes that\nSection 2 authorizes courts to conduct a \u201ctotality of\ncircumstances\u201d analysis.Ante, at 16. But as described\nabove, Congress mainly added that language so that Section 2 could\nprotect against \u201cthe demonstrated ingenuity of state and local\ngovernments in hobbling minority voting power.\u201dDe Grandy,\n512 U.\u00a0S., at 1018; seesupra, at 16\u201317. The totality\ninquiry requires courts to explore how ordinary-seeming laws can\ninteract with local conditions\u2014economic, social, historical\u2014to\nproduce race-based voting inequalities. That inquiry hardly gives a\ncourt the license to devise whatever limitations on Section 2\u2019s\nreach it would have liked Congress to enact. But that is the\nlicense the majority takes. The \u201cimportant circumstances\u201d it\ninvents all cut in one direction\u2014toward limiting liability for\nrace-based voting inequalities.Ante, at 16. (Indeed, the\nmajority gratuitously dismisses several factors that point the\nopposite way. Seeante, at 19\u201321.) Think of the majority\u2019s\nlist as a set of extra-textual restrictions on Section 2\u2014methods of\ncounteracting the law Congress actually drafted to achieve the\npurposesCongressthought \u201cimportant.\u201d The list\u2014not a test,\nthe majority hastens to assure us, with delusions of modesty\u2014stacks\nthe deck against minority citizens\u2019 voting rights. Never mind that\nCongress drafted a statute to protect those rights\u2014to prohibit any\nnumber of schemes the majority\u2019s non-test test makes it possible to\nsave.Start with the majority\u2019s first idea: a \u201c[m]ere\ninconvenience[\u00a0]\u201d exception to Section 2.Ante, at 16.\nVoting, the majority says, imposes a set of \u201cusual burdens\u201d: Some\ntime, some travel, some rule compliance.Ibid. And all of\nthat is beneath the notice of Section 2\u2014even if those burdens fall\nhighly unequally on members of different races. Seeibid.\nBut that categorical exclusion, for seemingly small (or \u201c[un]usual\u201d\nor \u201c[un]serious\u201d) burdens, is nowhere in the provision\u2019s text. To\nthe contrary (and as this Court has recognized before), Section 2\nallows no \u201csafe harbor[s]\u201d for election rules resulting in\ndisparate voting opportunities.De Grandy, 512 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 1018; seesupra, at 17. The section applies toanydiscriminatory \u201cvoting qualification,\u201d \u201cprerequisite to voting,\u201d or\n\u201cstandard, practice, or procedure\u201d\u2014even the kind creating only\n(what the majority thinks of as) an ordinary burden. And the\nsection cares aboutanyrace-based \u201cabridgments\u201d of voting,\nnot just measures that come near to preventing that activity.\nCongress, recall, was intent on eradicating the \u201csubtle, as well as\nthe obvious,\u201d ways of suppressing minority voting.Allen,\n393 U.\u00a0S., at 565; seesupra, at 14. One of those more\nsubtle ways is to impose \u201cinconveniences,\u201d especially a collection\nof them, differentially affecting members of one race. The certain\nresult\u2014because every inconvenience makes voting both somewhat more\ndifficult and somewhat less likely\u2014will be to deter minority votes.\nIn countenancing such an election system, the majority departs from\nCongress\u2019s vision, set down in text, of ensuring equal voting\nopportunity. It chooses equality-lite.And what is a \u201cmere inconvenience\u201d or \u201cusual\nburden\u201d anyway? The drafters of the Voting Rights Act understood\nthat \u201csocial and historical conditions,\u201d including disparities in\neducation, wealth, and employment, often affect opportunities to\nvote.Gingles, 478 U.\u00a0S., at 47; seesupra, at\n16\u201317. What does not prevent one citizen from casting a vote might\nprevent another. How is a judge supposed to draw an \u201cinconvenience\u201d\nline in some reasonable place, taking those differences into\naccount? Consider a law banning the handing out of water to voters.\nNo more than\u2014or not even\u2014an inconvenience when lines are short; but\nwhat of when they are, as in some neighborhoods, hours-long? The\npoint here is that judges lack an objective way to decide which\nvoting obstacles are \u201cmere\u201d and which are not, for all voters at\nall times. And so Section 2 does not ask the question.The majority\u2019s \u201cmultiple ways to vote\u201d factor is\nsimilarly flawed.Ante, at 18. True enough, a State with\nthree ways to vote (say, on Election Day; early in person; or by\nmail) may be more \u201copen\u201d than a State with only one (on Election\nDay). And some other statute might care about that. But Section 2\ndoes not. What it cares about is that a State\u2019s \u201cpolitical\nprocesses\u201d are \u201cequallyopen\u201d to voters of all races. And a\nState\u2019s electoral process is not equally open if, for example, the\nState \u201conly\u201d makes Election Day voting by members of one race\npeculiarly difficult. The House Report on Section 2 addresses that\nissue. It explains that an election system would violate Section 2\nif minority citizens had a lesser opportunity than white citizens\nto use absentee ballots. See H.\u00a0R. Rep., at 31, n.\u00a0106.\nEven if the minority citizens could just as easily vote in person,\nthe scheme would \u201cresult in unequal access to the political\nprocess.\u201dId., at 31. That is not some piece of contestable\nlegislative history. It is the only reading of Section 2 possible,\ngiven the statute\u2019s focus on equality. Maybe the majority does not\nmean to contest that proposition; its discussion of this supposed\nfactor is short and cryptic. But if the majority does intend to\nexcuse so much discrimination, it is wrong. Making one method of\nvoting less available to minority citizens than to whites\nnecessarily means giving the former \u201cless opportunity than other\nmembers of the electorate to participate in the political process.\u201d\n\u00a710301(b).The majority\u2019s history-and-commonality factor\nalso pushes the inquiry away from what the statute demands. The\noddest part of the majority\u2019s analysis is the idea that \u201cwhat was\nstandard practice when \u00a72 was amended in 1982 is a relevant\nconsideration.\u201dAnte, at 16. The 1982 state of the world is\nno part of the Section 2 test. An election rule prevalent at that\ntime may make voting harder for minority than for white citizens;\nSection 2 then covers such a rule, as it covers any other. And\ncontrary to the majority\u2019s unsupported speculation, Congress\n\u201cintended\u201d exactly that.Ante, at 17; see H.\u00a0R. Rep.,\nat\u00a014 (explaining that the Act aimed to eradicate the\n\u201cnumerous practices and procedures which act as continued barriers\nto registration and voting\u201d).[8] Section 2 was meant to disrupt the status quo, not to\npreserve it\u2014to eradicate then-current discriminatory practices, not\nto set them in amber. SeeBossier, 528 U.\u00a0S., at 334\n(under Section 2, \u201c[i]f thestatus quo\u201d abridges the right\nto vote \u201crelative to what the right to voteought to be, the\nstatus quo itself must be changed\u201d).[9] And as to election rules common now, the majority\noversimplifies. Even if those rules are unlikely to violate Section\n2 everywhere, they may easily do so somewhere. That is because the\ndemographics and political geography of States vary widely and\nSection 2\u2019s application depends on place-specific facts. As we have\nrecognized, the statute calls for \u201can intensely local appraisal,\u201d\nnot a count-up-the-States exercise.Gingles, 478 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 79; seesupra, at 17. This case, as I\u2019ll later discuss,\noffers a perfect illustration of how the difference between those\ntwo approaches can matter. Seeinfra, at 29\u201340.That leaves only the majority\u2019s discussion of\nstate interests, which is again skewed so as to limit Section 2\nliability. No doubt that under our precedent, a state interest in\nan election rule \u201cis a legitimate factor to be considered.\u201dHouston Lawyers\u2019 Assn., 501 U.\u00a0S., at 426. But the\nmajority wrongly dismisses the need for the closest possible fit\nbetween means and end\u2014that is, between the terms of the rule and\nthe State\u2019s asserted interest.Ante, at 21. In the past,\nthis Court has stated that a discriminatory election rule must\nfall, no matter how weighty the interest claimed, if a less biased\nlaw would not \u201csignificantly impair[ that] interest.\u201dHouston\nLawyers\u2019 Assn., 501 U.\u00a0S., at 428; seesupra, at\n17\u201318, and n. 5. And as the majority concedes, we apply that kind\nof means-end standard in every other context\u2014employment, housing,\nbanking\u2014where the law addresses racially discriminatory effects:\nThere, the rule must be \u201cstrict[ly] necess[ary]\u201d to the interest.Ante, at 21; see,e.g.,Albemarle Paper\nCo. v.Moody,422 U.S.\n405, 425 (1975) (holding that an employment policy cannot stand\nif another policy, \u201cwithout a similarly undesirable racial effect,\nwould also serve the employer\u2019s legitimate interest\u201d). The majority\nargues that \u201c[t]he text of [those] provisions\u201d differs from Section\n2\u2019s.Ante, at 20. But if anything, Section 2 gives less\nweight to competing interests: Unlike in most discrimination laws,\nthey enter the inquiry only through the provision\u2019s reference to\nthe \u201ctotality of circumstances\u201d\u2014through, then, a statutory\nbackdoor. So the majority falls back on the idea that \u201c[d]emanding\nsuch a tight fit would have the effect of invalidating a great many\nneutral voting regulations.\u201dAnte, at 21; seeante,\nat 25. But a state interest becomes relevant only when a voting\nrule, even if neutral on its face, is foundnotneutral in\noperation\u2014only, that is, when the rule provides unequal access to\nthe political process. Apparently, the majority does not want to\n\u201cinvalidate [too] many\u201d of those actually discriminatory rules. But\nCongress had a different goal in enacting Section 2.The majority\u2019s approach, which would ask only\nwhether a discriminatory law \u201creasonablypursue[s] important\nstate interests,\u201d gives election officials too easy an escape from\nSection 2.Ante, at 25 (emphasis added). Of course\npreventing voter intimidation is an important state interest. And\nof course preventing election fraud is the same. But those\ninterests are also easy to assert groundlessly or pretextually in\nvoting discrimination cases. Congress knew that when it passed\nSection 2. Election officials can all too often, the Senate Report\nnoted, \u201coffer a non-racial rationalization\u201d for even laws that\n\u201cpurposely discriminate[\u00a0].\u201d S. Rep., at\u00a037; seesupra, at 14, 17\u201318, and n. 5. A necessity test filters out\nthose offerings. See,e.g.,Albemarle, 422\nU.\u00a0S., at 425. It thereby prevents election officials from\nflouting, circumventing, or discounting Section 2\u2019s command not to\ndiscriminate.In that regard, the past offers a lesson to the\npresent. Throughout American history, election officials have\nasserted anti-fraud interests in using voter suppression laws. Poll\ntaxes, the classic mechanism to keep black people from voting, were\noften justified as \u201cpreserv[ing] the purity of the ballot box [and]\nfacilitat[ing] honest elections.\u201d J. Kousser, The Shaping of\nSouthern Politics 111, n.\u00a09 (1974). A raft of election\nregulations\u2014including \u201celaborate registration procedures\u201d and\n\u201cearly poll closings\u201d\u2014similarly excluded white immigrants (Irish,\nItalians, and so on) from the polls on the ground of \u201cprevent[ing]\nfraud and corruption.\u201d Keyssar 159; seeibid. (noting that\nin those times \u201cclaims of widespread corruption\u201d were backed\n\u201calmost entirely\u201d by \u201canecdotes [with] little systematic\ninvestigation or evidence\u201d). Take even the majority\u2019s example of a\npolicy advancing an \u201cimportant state interest\u201d: \u201cthe use of private\nvoting booths,\u201d in which voters marked their own ballots.Ante, at 19. In the majority\u2019s high-minded account, that\ninnovation\u2014then known as the Australian voting system, for the\ncountry that introduced it\u2014served entirely to prevent undue\ninfluence. But when adopted, it also prevented many illiterate\ncitizens\u2014especially African Americans\u2014from voting. And indeed, that\nwas partly the point. As an 1892 Arkansas song went:The Australian Ballot works like a charm,It makes them think and scratch,And when a Negro gets a ballotHe has certainly got his match.Kousser 54. Across the South, the Australian\nballot decreased voter participation among whites by anywhere from\n8% to 28% but among African Americans by anywhere from 15% to 45%.\nSeeid., at 56. Does that mean secret ballot laws violate\nSection 2 today? Of course not. But should the majority\u2019s own\nexample give us all a bit of pause? Yes, it should. It serves as a\nreminder that States have always found it natural to wrap\ndiscriminatory policies in election-integrity garb.Congress enacted Section 2 to prevent those\nmaneuvers from working. It knew that States and localities had over\ntime enacted measure after measure imposing discriminatory voting\nburdens. And it knew that governments were proficient in justifying\nthose measures on non-racial grounds. So Congress called a halt. It\nenacted a statute that would strike down all unnecessary laws,\nincluding facially neutral ones, that result in members of a racial\ngroup having unequal access to the political process.But the majority is out of sympathy with that\nmeasure. The majority thinks a statute that would remove those laws\nis not, as Justice Ginsburg once called it, \u201cconsequential,\nefficacious, and amply justified.\u201dShelby County, 570\nU.\u00a0S., at 562 (dissenting opinion). Instead, the majority\nthinks it too \u201cradical\u201d to stomach.Ante, at 21, 25. The\nmajority objects to an excessive \u201ctransfer of the authority to set\nvoting rules from the States to the federal courts.\u201dAnte,\nat 25. It even sees that transfer as \u201c[un]democratic.\u201dIbid.\nBut maybe the majority should pay more attention to the \u201chistorical\nbackground\u201d that it insists \u201cdoes not tell us how to decide this\ncase.\u201dAnte, at 21. That history makes clear the\nincongruity, in interpreting this statute, of the majority\u2019s paean\nto state authority\u2014and conversely, its denigration of federal\nresponsibility for ensuring non-discriminatory voting rules. The\nVoting Rights Act was meant to replace state and local election\nrules that needlessly make voting harder for members of one race\nthan for others. The text of the Act perfectly reflects that\nobjective. The \u201cdemocratic\u201d principle it upholds is not one of\nStates\u2019 rights as against federal courts. The democratic principle\nit upholds is the right of every American, of every race, to have\nequal access to the ballot box. The majority today undermines that\nprinciple as it refuses to apply the terms of the statute. By\ndeclaring some racially discriminatory burdens inconsequential, and\nby refusing to subject asserted state interests to serious\nmeans-end scrutiny, the majority enables voting discrimination.IIIJust look at Arizona. Two of that State\u2019s\npolicies disproportionately affect minority citizens\u2019 opportunity\nto vote. The first\u2014the out-of-precinct policy\u2014results in Hispanic\nand African American voters\u2019 ballots being thrown out at a\nstatistically higher rate than those of whites. And whatever the\nmajority might say about the ordinariness of such a rule, Arizona\napplies it in extra-ordinary fashion: Arizona isthenational outlier in dealing with out-of-precinct votes, with the\nnext-worst offender nowhere in sight. The second rule\u2014the\nballot-collection ban\u2014makes voting meaningfully more difficult for\nNative American citizens than for others. And nothing about how\nthat ban is applied is \u201cusual\u201d either\u2014this time because of how many\nof the State\u2019s Native American citizens need to travel long\ndistances to use the mail. Both policies violate Section 2, on a\nstraightforward application of its text. Considering the \u201ctotality\nof circumstances,\u201d both \u201cresult in\u201d members of some races having\n\u201cless opportunity than other members of the electorate to\nparticipate in the political process and to elect a representative\nof their choice.\u201d \u00a710301(b). The majority reaches the opposite\nconclusion because it closes its eyes to the facts on the\nground.[10]AArizona\u2019s out-of-precinct policy requires\ndiscarding any Election Day ballot cast elsewhere than in a voter\u2019s\nassigned precinct. Under the policy, officials throw out every\nchoice in every race\u2014including national or statewide races\n(e.g., for President or Governor) that appear\nidentically on every precinct\u2019s ballot. The question is whether\nthat policy unequally affects minority citizens\u2019 opportunity to\ncast a vote.Although the majority portrays Arizona\u2019s use of\nthe rule as \u201cunremarkable,\u201dante, at 26, the State is in\nfact a national aberration when it comes to discarding out-of-\nprecinct ballots. In 2012, about 35,000 ballots across the country\nwere thrown out because they were cast at the wrong precinct. See\nU.\u00a0S. Election Assistance Commission, 2012 Election\nAdministration and Voting Survey 53 (2013). Nearly one in three of\nthose discarded votes\u201410,979\u2014was cast in Arizona.Id., at\n52. As the Court of Appeals concluded, and the chart below\nindicates, Arizona threw away ballots in that year at 11 times the\nrate of the second-place discarder (Washington State).Democratic Nat.Committeev.Hobbs, 948 F.3d\n989, 1001 (CA9 2020); see App. 72. Somehow the majority labels that\ndifference \u201cmarginal[\u00a0],\u201dante, at 27, but it is\nanything but. More recently, the number of discarded ballots in the\nState has gotten smaller: Arizona counties have increasingly\nabandoned precinct-based voting (in favor of county-wide \u201cvote\ncenters\u201d), so the out-of-precinct rule has fewer votes to operate\non. And the majority primarily relies on those latest (2016)\nnumbers. But across the five elections at issue in this litigation\n(2008\u20132016), Arizona threw away far more out-of-precinct\nvotes\u2014almost 40,000\u2014than did any other State in the country.Votes in such numbers can matter\u2014enough for\nSection 2 to apply. The majority obliquely suggests not, comparing\nthe smallish number of thrown-out votes (minority and non-minority\nalike) to the far larger number of votes cast and counted. Seeante, at 27. But elections are often fought and won at the\nmargins\u2014certainly in Arizona. Consider the number of votes\nseparating the two presidential candidates in the most recent\nelection: 10,457. That is fewer votes than Arizona discarded under\nthe out-of-precinct policy in two of the prior three presidential\nelections. This Court previously rejected the idea\u2014the \u201cerroneous\nassumption\u201d\u2014\u201cthat a small group of voters can never influence the\noutcome of an election.\u201dChisom, 501 U.\u00a0S., at 397,\nn.\u00a024. For that reason, we held that even \u201ca small minority\u201d\ngroup can claim Section 2 protection. Seeibid. Similarly\nhere, the out-of-precinct policy\u2014which discards thousands upon\nthousands of ballots in every election\u2014affects more than sufficient\nvotes to implicate Section 2\u2019s guarantee of equal electoral\nopportunity.And the out-of-precinct policy operates\nunequally: Ballots cast by minorities are more likely to be\ndiscarded. In 2016, Hispanics, African Americans, and Native\nAmericans were about twice as likely\u2014or said another way, 100% more\nlikely\u2014to have their ballots discarded than whites. See App. 122.\nAnd it is possible to break that down a bit. Sixty percent of the\nvoting in Arizona is from Maricopa County. There, Hispanics were\n110% more likely, African Americans 86% more likely, and Native\nAmericans 73% more likely to have their ballots tossed. Seeid., at 153. Pima County, the next largest county, provides\nanother 15% of the statewide vote. There, Hispanics were 148% more\nlikely, African Americans 80% more likely, and Native Americans 74%\nmore likely to lose their votes. Seeid., at 157. The record\ndoes not contain statewide figures for 2012. But in Maricopa and\nPima Counties, the percentages were about the same as in 2016. Seeid., at 87, 91. Assessing those disparities, the plaintiffs\u2019\nexpert found, and the District Court accepted, that the\ndiscriminatory impact of the out-of-precinct policy was\nstatistically significant\u2014meaning, again, that it was highly\nunlikely to occur by chance. SeeDemocratic Nat.Committeev.Reagan, 329 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d 824, 871\n(Ariz. 2018);supra, at 15, n.\u00a04.The majority is wrong to assert that those\nstatistics are \u201chighly misleading.\u201dAnte, at 28. In the\nmajority\u2019s view, they can be dismissed because the great mass of\nvoters are unaffected by the out-of-precinct policy. Seeibid. But Section 2 is less interested in \u201cabsolute terms\u201d\n(as the majority calls them) than in relative ones.Ante, at\n27; seesupra, at 14\u201315. Arizona\u2019s policy creates a\nstatistically significant disparity between minority and white\nvoters: Because of the policy, members of different racial groups\ndo not in fact have an equal likelihood of having their ballots\ncounted. Suppose a State decided to throw out 1% of the Hispanic\nvote each election. Presumably, the majority would not approve the\naction just because 99% of the Hispanic vote is unaffected. Nor\nwould the majority say that Hispanics in that system have an equal\nshot of casting an effective ballot. Here, the policy is not so\novert; but under Section 2, that difference does not matter.\nBecause the policy \u201cresults in\u201d statistically significant\ninequality, it implicates Section 2. And the kind of inequality\nthat the policy produces is not the kind only a statistician could\nsee. A rule that throws out, each and every election, thousands of\nvotes cast by minority citizens is a rule that can affect election\noutcomes. If you were a minority vote suppressor in Arizona or\nelsewhere, you would want that rule in your bag of tricks. You\nwould not think it remotely irrelevant.And the case against Arizona\u2019s policy grows only\nstronger the deeper one digs. The majority fails to conduct the\n\u201csearching practical evaluation\u201d of \u201cpast and present reality\u201d that\nSection 2\u2019s \u201ctotality of circumstances\u201d inquiry demands.De\nGrandy, 512 U.\u00a0S., at 1018. Had the majority done so, it\nwould have discovered why Arizona\u2019s out-of- precinct policy has\nsuch a racially disparate impact on voting opportunity. Much of the\nstory has to do with the siting and shifting of polling places.\nArizona moves polling places at a startling rate. Maricopa County\n(recall, Arizona\u2019s largest by far) changed 40% or more of polling\nplaces before both the 2008 and the 2012 elections. See 329\nF.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at 858 (noting also that changes \u201ccontinued to\noccur in 2016\u201d). In 2012 (the election with the best data), voters\naffected by those changes had an out-of-precinct voting rate that\nwas 40% higher than other voters did. Seeibid. And,\ncritically, Maricopa\u2019s relocations hit minority voters harder than\nothers. In 2012, the county moved polling stations in African\nAmerican and Hispanic neighborhoods 30% more often than in white\nones. See App. 110\u2013111. The odds of those changes leading to\nmistakes increased yet further because the affected areas are home\nto citizens with relatively low education and income levels. Seeid., at 170\u2013171. And even putting relocations aside, the\nsiting of polling stations in minority areas caused significant\nout-of-precinct voting. Hispanic and Native American voters had to\ntravel further than white voters did to their assigned polling\nplaces. Seeid., at 109. And all minority voters were\ndisproportionately likely to be assigned to polling places other\nthan the ones closest to where they lived. Seeid., at 109,\nand n.\u00a030, 175\u2013176. Small wonder, given such siting decisions,\nthat minority voters found it harder to identify and get to their\ncorrect precincts. But the majority does not address these\nmatters.[11]Facts also undermine the State\u2019s asserted\ninterests, which the majority hangs its hat on. A government\ninterest, as even the majority recognizes, is \u201cmerely one factor to\nbe considered\u201d in Section 2\u2019s totality analysis.Houston\nLawyers\u2019 Assn., 501 U.\u00a0S., at 427; seeante, at 19.\nHere, the State contends that it needs the out-of-precinct policy\nto support a precinct-based voting system. But 20 other States\ncombine precinct-based systems with mechanisms for partially\ncounting out-of-precinct ballots (that is, counting the votes for\noffices like President or Governor). And the District Court found\nthat it would be \u201cadministratively feasible\u201d for Arizona to join\nthat group. 329 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at 860. Arizona\u2014echoed by the\nmajority\u2014objects that adopting a partial-counting approach would\ndecrease compliance with the vote-in-your-precinct rule (by\nreducing the penalty for a voter\u2019s going elsewhere). But there is\nmore than a little paradox in that response. We know from the\nextraordinary number of ballots Arizona discards that its current\nsystem fails utterly to \u201cinduce[\u00a0] compliance.\u201dAnte,\nat 28\u201329; seesupra, at 30\u201331. Presumably, that is because\nthe system\u2014most notably, its placement and shifting of polling\nplaces\u2014sows an unparalleled level of voter confusion. A State that\nmakes compliance with an election rule so unusually hard is in no\nposition to claim that its interest in \u201cinduc[ing] compliance\u201d\noutweighs the need to remedy the race-based discrimination that\nrule has caused.BArizona\u2019s law mostly banning third-party\nballot collection also results in a significant race-based\ndisparity in voting opportunities. The problem with that law again\nlies in facts nearly unique to Arizona\u2014here, the presence of rural\nNative American communities that lack ready access to mail service.\nGiven that circumstance, the Arizona statute discriminates in just\nthe way Section 2 proscribes. The majority once more comes to a\ndifferent conclusion only by ignoring the local conditions with\nwhich Arizona\u2019s law interacts.The critical facts for evaluating the\nballot-collection rule have to do with mail service. Most Arizonans\nvote by mail. But many rural Native American voters lack access to\nmail service, to a degree hard for most of us to fathom. Only 18%\nof Native voters in rural counties receive home mail delivery,\ncompared to 86% of white voters living in those counties. See 329\nF.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at 836. And for many or most, there is no nearby\npost office. Native Americans in rural Arizona \u201coften must travel\n45 minutes to 2 hours just to get to a mailbox.\u201d 948 F.\u00a03d, at\n1006; see 329 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at 869 (\u201cReady access to reliable\nand secure mail service is nonexistent\u201d in some Native American\ncommunities). And between a quarter to a half of households in\nthese Native communities do not have a car. Seeibid. So\ngetting ballots by mail and sending them back poses a serious\nchallenge for Arizona\u2019s rural Native Americans.[12]For that reason, an unusually high rate of\nNative Americans used to \u201creturn their early ballots with the\nassistance of third parties.\u201dId., at 870.[13] As the District Court found: \u201c[F]or\nmany Native Americans living in rural locations,\u201d voting \u201cis an\nactivity that requires the active assistance of friends and\nneighbors.\u201dIbid. So in some Native communities, third-party\ncollection of ballots\u2014mostly by fellow clan members\u2014became\n\u201cstandard practice.\u201dIbid. And stopping it, as one tribal\nelection official testified, \u201cwould be a huge devastation.\u201dIbid.; see Brief for Navajo Nation asAmicus Curiae19\u201320 (explaining that ballot collection is how Navajo voters \u201chave\nhistorically handled their mail-in ballots\u201d).Arizona has always regulated these activities to\nprevent fraud. State law makes it a felony offense for a ballot\ncollector to fail to deliver a ballot. See Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann.\n\u00a716\u20131005 (Cum. Supp. 2020). It is also a felony for a ballot\ncollector to tamper with a ballot in any manner. Seeibid.\nAnd as the District Court found, \u201ctamper evident envelopes and a\nrigorous voter signature verification procedure\u201d protect against\nany such attempts. 329 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at 854. For those reasons\nand others, no fraud involving ballot collection has ever come to\nlight in the State.Id., at 852.Still, Arizona enacted\u2014with full knowledge of\nthe likely discriminatory consequences\u2014the near-blanket\nballot-collection ban challenged here. The first version of the\nlaw\u2014much less stringent than the current one\u2014passed the Arizona\nLegislature in 2011. But the Department of Justice, in its Section\n5 review, expressed skepticism about the statute\u2019s compliance with\nthe Voting Rights Act, and the legislature decided to repeal the\nlaw rather than see it blocked (and thereby incur statutory\npenalties). See 329 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at 880; 52 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a710303(a)(1)(E) (providing that if a state law fails Section 5\nreview, the State may not escape the preclearance process for\nanother 10 years). Then, this Court decidedShelby County.\nWith Section 5 gone, the State Legislature felt free to proceed\nwith a new ballot-collection ban, despite the potentially\ndiscriminatory effects that the preclearance process had revealed.\nThe enacted law contains limited exceptions for family members and\ncaregivers. But it includes no similar exceptions for clan members\nor others with Native kinship ties. They and anyone else who picks\nup a neighbor\u2019s ballot and takes it to a post office, or delivers\nit to an election site, is punishable as a felon. See Ariz. Rev.\nStat. \u00a716\u20131005(H).Put all of that together, and Arizona\u2019s\nballot-collection ban violates Section 2. The ban interacts with\nconditions on the ground\u2014most crucially, disparate access to mail\nservice\u2014to create unequal voting opportunities for Native\nAmericans. Recall that only 18% of rural Native Americans in the\nState have home delivery; that travel times of an hour or more to\nthe nearest post office are common; that many members of the\ncommunity do not have cars. Seesupra, at 36. Given those\nfacts, the law prevents many Native Americans from making effective\nuse of one of the principal means of voting in Arizona.[14] What is an inconsequential\nburden for others is for these citizens a severe hardship. And the\nState has shown no need for the law to go so far. Arizona, as noted\nabove, already has statutes in place to deter fraudulent collection\npractices. Seesupra, at 37. Those laws give every sign of\nworking. Arizona has not offered any evidence of fraud in ballot\ncollection, or even an account of a harm threatening to happen. See\n329 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at 852 (\u201c[T]here has never been a case of\nvoter fraud associated with ballot collection charged in Arizona\u201d).\nAnd anyway, Arizona did not have to entirely forego a\nballot-collection restriction to comply with Section 2. It could,\nfor example, have added an exception to the statute for Native clan\nor kinship ties, to accommodate the special, \u201cintensely local\u201d\nsituation of the rural Native American community.Gingles,\n478 U.\u00a0S., at 79. That Arizona did not do so shows, at best,\nselective indifference to the voting opportunities of its Native\nAmerican citizens.The majority\u2019s opinion fails to acknowledge any\nof these facts. It quotes extensively from the District Court\u2019s\nfinding that the ballot-collection ban does not interfere with the\nvoting opportunities of minority groups generally. Seeante,\nat 31, n.\u00a019. But it never addresses the court\u2019s separate\nfinding that the ban poses a unique burden for Native Americans.\nSeesupra, at 36\u201337. Except in a pair of footnotes\nresponding to this dissent, the term \u201cNative American\u201d appears once\n(count it, once) in the majority\u2019s five-page discussion of\nArizona\u2019s ballot-collection ban. So of course that community\u2019s\nstrikingly limited access to mail service is not\naddressed.[15] In the\nmajority\u2019s alternate world, the collection ban is just a \u201cusual\nburden[\u00a0] of voting\u201d for everyone.Ante, at 30. And in\nthat world, \u201c[f]raud is a real risk\u201d of ballot collection\u2014as to\nevery community, in every circumstance\u2014just because the State in\nlitigation asserts that it is.Ante, at 33. The State need\nnot even show that the discriminatory rule it enacted is necessary\nto prevent the fraud it purports to fear. So the State has no duty\nto substitute a non-discriminatory rule that would adequately serve\nits professed goal. Like the rest of today\u2019s opinion, the\nmajority\u2019s treatment of the collection ban thus flouts what Section\n2 commands: the eradication of election rules resulting in unequal\nopportunities for minority voters.IVCongress enacted the Voting Rights Act to\naddress a deep fault of our democracy\u2014the historical and continuing\nattempt to withhold from a race of citizens their fair share of\ninfluence on the political process. For a century, African\nAmericans had struggled and sacrificed to wrest their voting rights\nfrom a resistant Nation. The statute they and their allies at long\nlast attained made a promise to all Americans. From then on,\nCongress demanded, the political process would be equally open to\nevery citizen, regardless of race.One does not hear much in the majority opinion\nabout that promise. One does not hear much about what brought\nCongress to enact the Voting Rights Act, what Congress hoped for it\nto achieve, and what obstacles to that vision remain today. One\nwould never guess that the Act is, as the President who signed it\nwrote, \u201cmonumental.\u201d Johnson Papers 841. For all the opinion\nreveals, the majority might be considering any old piece of\nlegislation\u2014say, the Lanham Act or ERISA.But then, at least, the majority should treat\nthe Voting Rights Act as if it were ordinary legislation. The Court\nalways says that it must interpret a statute according to its\ntext\u2014that it has no warrant to override congressional choices. But\nthe majority today flouts those choices with abandon. The language\nof Section 2 is as broad as broad can be. It applies to any policy\nthat \u201cresults in\u201d disparate voting opportunities for minority\ncitizens. It prohibits, without any need to show bad motive, even\nfacially neutral laws that make voting harder for members of one\nrace than of another, given their differing life circumstances.\nThat is the expansive statute Congress wrote, and that our prior\ndecisions have recognized. But the majority today lessens the\nlaw\u2014cuts Section 2 down to its own preferred size. The majority\ncreates a set of extra-textual exceptions and considerations to sap\nthe Act\u2019s strength, and to save laws like Arizona\u2019s. No matter what\nCongress wanted, the majority has other ideas.This Court has no right to remake Section 2.\nMaybe some think that vote suppression is a relic of history\u2014and so\nthe need for a potent Section 2 has come and gone. Cf.Shelby\nCounty, 570 U.\u00a0S., at 547 (\u201c[T]hings have changed\ndramatically\u201d). But Congress gets to make that call. Because it has\nnot done so, this Court\u2019s duty is to apply the law as it is\nwritten. The law that confronted one of this country\u2019s most\nenduring wrongs; pledged to give every American, of every race, an\nequal chance to participate in our democracy; and now stands as the\ncrucial tool to achieve that goal. That law, of all laws, deserves\nthe sweep and power Congress gave it. That law, of all laws, should\nnot be diminished by this Court.Notes1The majority brands this\nhistorical account part of an \u201cextended effort at misdirection.\u201dAnte, at 22. I am tempted merely to reply: Enough said about\nthe majority\u2019s outlook on the statute before us. But I will add\nwhat should be obvious\u2014that no one can understand the Voting Rights\nAct without recognizing what led Congress to enact it, and what\nCongress wanted it to change.2Although causation is\nhard to establish definitively, those post-Shelby Countychanges appear to have reduced minority participation in the next\nelection cycle. The most comprehensive study available found that\nin areas freed from Section 5 review, white turnout remained the\nsame, but \u201cminority participation dropped by 2.1 percentage\npoints\u201d\u2014a stark reversal in direction from prior elections. Ang, Do\n40-Year-Old Facts Still Matter?, 11 Am. Econ. J.: Applied\nEconomics, No. 3, pp. 1, 35 (2019). The results, said the scholar\nwho crunched the numbers, \u201cprovide early evidence that the Shelby\nruling may jeopardize decades of voting rights progress.\u201dId., at 36. The election laws passed inShelby\nCounty\u2019s wake \u201cmay have negated many of the gains made under\npreclearance.\u201dIbid.3A final sentence, not at\nissue here, specifies that the voting right provided does not\nentitle minority citizens to proportional representation in\nelectoral offices. Seeinfra, at 19, n. 6.4I agree with the majority\nthat \u201cvery small differences\u201d among racial groups do not matter.Ante, at 18. Some racial disparities are too small to\nsupport a finding of unequal access because they are not\nstatistically significant\u2014that is, because they might have arisen\nfrom chance alone. SeeMatrixx Initiatives,Inc. v.Siracusano,563 U.S.\n27, 39 (2011). The statistical significance test is standard in\nall legal contexts addressing disparate impact. SeeRicciv.DeStefano,557 U.S.\n557, 587 (2009). In addition, there may be some threshold of\nwhat is sometimes called \u201cpractical significance\u201d\u2014a level of\ninequality that, even if statistically meaningful, is just too\ntrivial for the legal system to care about. See Federal Judicial\nCenter, Reference Manual on Scientific Evidence 252 (3d ed. 2011)\n(discussing differences that are not \u201cpractically\nimportant\u201d).5The majority pretends\nthatHouston Lawyers\u2019 Assn. did not ask about the\navailability of a less discriminatory means of serving the State\u2019s\nend, seeante, at 23, n. 16\u2014but the inquiry is right there\non page 428 (examining \u201cif [the] impairment of a minority group\u2019s\nvoting strength could be remedied without significantly impairing\nthe State\u2019s interest in electing judges on a district-wide basis\u201d).\nIn posing that question, the Court did what Congress wanted,\nbecause absent a necessity test, States could too easily get away\nwith offering \u201cnon-racial\u201d but pretextual \u201crationalization[s].\u201d\nS.\u00a0Rep., at 37; seesupra, at 14. And the Court did\nwhat it always does in applying laws barring discriminatory\neffects\u2014ask whether a challenged policy is necessary to achieve the\nasserted goal. Seeinfra, at 26. Contrary to the majority\u2019s\nview, that kind of inquiry would not result in \u201cinvalidat[ing] just\nabout any voting rule a State adopts.\u201dAnte, at 24. A\nplaintiff bears the burden of showing that a less discriminatory\nlaw would be \u201cat least as effective in achieving the [State\u2019s]\nlegitimate purpose.\u201dRenov.American Civil Liberties\nUnion,521 U.S.\n844, 874 (1997). And \u201ccost may be an important factor\u201d in that\nanalysis, so the plaintiff could not (as the majority proposes) say\nmerely that the State can combat fraud by \u201chiring more\ninvestigators and prosecutors.\u201dBurwellv.Hobby Lobby\nStores,Inc.,573 U.S.\n682, 730 (2014);ante, at 24. Given those features of\nthe alternative-means inquiry, a State that tries both to serve its\nelectoral interests and to give its minority citizens equal\nelectoral access will rarely have anything to fear from a Section 2\nsuit.6Contra the majority, seeante, at 5\u20136, 22, and n. 14, the House-Senate compromise\nreached in amending Section 2 has nothing to do with the law\nrelevant here. The majority is hazy about the content of this\ncompromise for a reason: It was about proportional representation.\nAs then-Justice Rehnquist explained, members of the Senate\nexpressed concern that the \u201cresults in\u201d language of the\nHouse-passed bill would provide not \u201cmerely for equal \u2018access\u2019 to\nthe political process\u201d but also \u201cfor proportional representation\u201d\nof minority voters.Mississippi Republican Executive\nCommitteev.Brooks,469 U.S.\n1002, 1010 (1984) (dissenting opinion). Senator Dole\u2019s solution\nwas to add text making clear that minority voters had a right to\nequal voting opportunities, but no right to elect minority\ncandidates \u201cin numbers equal to their proportion in the\npopulation.\u201d 52 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a710301(b). The Dole Amendment,\nas Justice Rehnquist noted, ensured that under the \u201cresults in\u201d\nlanguage equal \u201c\u00a0\u2018access\u2019 only was required.\u201d 469 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 1010\u20131011; see 128 Cong. Rec. 14132 (1982) (Sen. Dole explaining\nthat as amended \u201cthe focus of the standard is on whether there is\nequal access to the political process, not on whether members of a\nparticular minority group have achieved proportional election\nresults\u201d). Nothing\u2014literally nothing\u2014suggests that the Senate\nwanted to water down the equal-access right that everyone agreed\nthe House\u2019s language covered. So the majority is dead wrong to say\nthat I want to \u201cundo\u201d the House-Senate compromise.Ante, at\n22. It is the majority that wants to transform that compromise to\nsupport a view of Section 2 held in neither the House nor the\nSenate.7In a single sentence, the\nmajority huffs that \u201cnobody disputes\u201d various of these \u201cpoints of\nlaw.\u201dAnte, at 21. Excellent! I only wish the majority would\ntake them to heart, both individually and in combination. For\nexample, the majority says it agrees that Section 2 reaches beyond\ndenials of voting to any \u201cabridgement.\u201d But then, as I\u2019ll later\ndiscuss, it insists that Section 2 has an interest only in rules\nthat \u201cblock or seriously hinder voting\u201d\u2014which appears to create a\n\u201cdenial orseriousabridgement\u201d standard.Ante, at\n16; seeinfra, at 22\u201323. Or, for example, the majority says\nit accepts that Section 2 may prohibit facially neutral election\nrules. But the majority takes every opportunity of casting doubt on\nthose applications. Each facially neutral rule it mentions is one\nthat it \u201cdoubt[s]\u201d Congress could have \u201cintended to uproot.\u201dAnte, at 18; seeante, at 6, 18, 21, 25. And it\ncriticizes this dissent for understanding the statute (but how\ncould anyone understand it differently?) as focusing on the\nracially \u201cdisparate impact\u201d of neutral election rules on the\nopportunity to vote.Ante, at 21. Most fundamentally, the\nmajority refuses to acknowledge how all the \u201cpoints of law\u201d it\nprofesses to agree with work in tandem to signal a statute of\nsignificant power and scope.8The House Report listed\nsome of those offensive, even though facially neutral and\nthen-prevalent, practices: \u201cinconvenient location and hours of\nregistration, dual registration for county and city elections,\u201d\n\u201cfrequent and unnecessary purgings and burdensome registration\nrequirements, and failure to provide .\u00a0.\u00a0. assistance to\nilliterates.\u201d H.\u00a0R. Rep., at\u00a014. So too the Senate Report\ncomplained of \u201cinconvenient voting and registration hours\u201d and\n\u201creregistration requirements and purging of voters.\u201d S.\u00a0Rep.,\nat 10, n.\u00a022; seesupra, at 16.9Even setting aside\nSection 2\u2019s status-quo-disrupting lean, this Court has long\nrejected\u2014including just last Term\u2014the majority\u2019s claim that the\nstate of the world at the time of a statute\u2019s enactment provides a\nuseful \u201cbenchmark[\u00a0]\u201d when applying a broadly written law.Ante, at 17. Such a law will typically come to encompass\napplications\u2014even \u201cimportant\u201d ones\u2014that were not \u201cforeseen at the\ntime of enactment.\u201dBostockv.Clayton County, 590\nU.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2020) (slip op., at 26). To prevent that from\nhappening\u2014as the majority does today, on the ground that Congress\nsimply must have \u201cintended\u201d it\u2014is \u201cto displace the plain meaning of\nthe law in favor of something lying behind it.\u201dIbid.; seeid., at ___ (slip op., at 30) (When a law is \u201cwritten in\nstarkly broad terms,\u201d it is \u201cvirtually guaranteed that unexpected\napplications [will] emerge over time\u201d).10Because I would affirm the Court of\nAppeals\u2019 holding that the effects of these policies violate Section\n2, I need not pass on that court\u2019s alternative holding that the\nlaws were enacted with discriminatory intent.11The\nmajority\u2019s excuse for failing to consider the plaintiffs\u2019 evidence\non Arizona\u2019s siting of polling places is that the plaintiffs did\nnot bring a separate claim against those practices. Seeante, at 30, n.\u00a018. If that sounds odd, it is. The\nmajority does not contest that the evidence on polling-place siting\nis relevant to the plaintiffs\u2019 challenge to the out-of-precinct\npolicy. Nor could the majority do so. The siting practices are one\nof the background conditions against which the out-of-precinct\npolicy operates\u2014exactly the kind of thing that a\ntotality-of-circumstances analysis demands a court take into\naccount. To refuse to think about those practices because the\nplaintiffs might have brought a freestanding claim against them is\nto impose an out-of-thin-air pleading requirement that operates to\nexclude exactly the evidence that most strongly signals a Section 2\nviolation.12Certain Hispanic communities in\nArizona confront similar difficulties. For example, in the border\ntown of San Luis, which is 98% Hispanic, \u201c[a]lmost 13,000 residents\nrely on a post office located across a major highway\u201d for their\nmail service. 329 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at 869. The median income in\nSan Luis is $22,000, so \u201cmany people [do] not own[\u00a0]\ncars\u201d\u2014making it \u201cdifficult\u201d to \u201creceiv[e] and send[\u00a0] mail.\u201dIbid.13The\nmajority faults the plaintiffs for failing to provide \u201cconcrete\u201d\nstatistical evidence on this point. Seeante, at 31. But no\nevidence of that kind exists: Arizona has never compiled data on\nthird-party ballot collection. And the witness testimony the\nplaintiffs offered in its stead allowed the District Court to\nconclude that minority voters, and especially Native Americans,\ndisproportionately needed third-party assistance to vote. See 329\nF.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at 869\u2013870.14To\nmake matters worse, in-person voting does not provide a feasible\nalternative for many rural Native voters. Given the low population\ndensity on Arizona\u2019s reservations, the distance to an assigned\npolling place\u2014like that to a post office\u2014is usually long. Again,\nmany Native citizens do not own cars. And the State\u2019s polling-place\nsiting practices cause some voters to go to the wrong precincts.\nRespecting the last factor, the District Court found that because\nNavajo voters \u201clack standard addresses[,] their precinct\nassignments\u201d are \u201cbased upon guesswork.\u201dDemocratic Nat.Committeev.Reagan, 329 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d 824, 873\n(Ariz. 2018). As a result, there is frequent \u201cconfusion about the\nvoter\u2019s correct polling place.\u201dIbid.15In\none of those footnotes, the majority defends its omission by saying\nthat \u201cno individual [Native American] voter testified that [the\ncollection ban] would make it significantly more difficult for him\nor her to vote.\u201dAnte, at 34, n.\u00a021. But as stated\nabove, the District Court found, based on the testimony of\n\u201clawmakers, elections officials[,] community advocates,\u201d and tribal\nrepresentatives, that the ban would have that effect for many\nNative American voters. 329 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at 868; seeid., at 870 (\u201c[F]or many Native Americans living in rural\nlocations,\u201d voting \u201cis an activity that requires the active\nassistance of friends and neighbors\u201d);supra, at 36\u201337. The\nidea that the claim here fails because the plaintiffs did not\nproducelessmeaningful evidence (a single person\u2019s\nexperience) does not meet the straight-face standard. And the\nmajority\u2019s remaining argument is, if anything, more eccentric.\nHere, the majority assures us that the Postal Service has a\n\u201cstatutory obligation[\u00a0]\u201d to provide \u201ceffective and regular\npostal services to rural areas.\u201dAnte, at 34, n.\u00a021.\nBut the record shows what the record shows\u2014once again, in the Court\nof Appeals\u2019 words, that Native Americans in rural Arizona \u201coften\nmust travel 45 minutes to 2 hours just to get to a mailbox.\u201dDemocratic Nat.Committeev.Hobbs, 948 F.3d\n989, 1006 (CA9 2020). That kind of background circumstance is\ncentral to Section 2\u2019s totality-of-circumstances analysis\u2014and here\nproduces a significant racial disparity in the opportunity to vote.\nThe majority\u2019s argument to the contrary is no better than if it\ncondoned a literacy test on the ground that a State had long had a\nstatutory obligation to teach all its citizens to read and\nwrite.",
