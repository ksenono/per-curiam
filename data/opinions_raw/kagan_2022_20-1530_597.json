Section 111 of the Clean Air Act\ndirects EPA to regulate stationary sources of any substance that\n\u201ccauses, or contributes significantly to, air pollution\u201d and that\n\u201cmay reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or\nwelfare.\u201d 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a77411(b)(1)(A). Carbon dioxide and\nother greenhouse gases fit that description. SeeAmerican Elec.\nPower, 564 U.\u00a0S., at 416\u2013417;Massachusetts, 549\nU.\u00a0S., at 528\u2013532. EPA thus serves as the Nation\u2019s \u201cprimary\nregulator of greenhouse gas emissions.\u201dAmerican Elec.\nPower, 564 U.\u00a0S., at 428. And among the most significant\nof the entities it regulates are fossil-fuel-fired (mainly coal-\nand natural-gas-fired) power plants. Today, those\nelectricity-producing plants are responsible for about one quarter\nof the Nation\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. See EPA, Sources of\nGreenhouse Gas Emissions (Apr. 14, 2022),\nhttps://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse- gas-emissions.\nCurbing that output is a necessary part of any effective approach\nfor addressing climate change.To carry out its Section 111 responsibility, EPA\nissued the Clean Power Plan in 2015. The premise of the Plan\u2014which\nno one really disputes\u2014was that operational improvements at the\nindividual-plant level would either \u201clead to only small emission\nreductions\u201d or would cost far more than a readily available\nregulatory alternative. 80 Fed. Reg. 64727\u201364728 (2015). That\nalternative\u2014which fossil-fuel-fired plants were \u201calready using to\nreduce their [carbon dioxide] emissions\u201d in \u201ca cost effective\nmanner\u201d\u2014is called generation shifting.Id., at 64728, 64769.\nAs the Court explains, the term refers to ways of shifting\nelectricity generation from higher emitting sources to lower\nemitting ones\u2014more specifically, from coal-fired to\nnatural-gas-fired sources, and from both to renewable sources like\nsolar and wind. Seeante, at 8. A power company (like the\nmany supporting EPA here) might divert its own resources to a\ncleaner source, or might participate in a cap-and-trade system with\nother companies to achieve the same emissions-reduction goals.This Court has obstructed EPA\u2019s effort from the\nbeginning. Right after the Obama administration issued the Clean\nPower Plan, the Court stayed its implementation. That action was\nunprecedented: Never before had the Court stayed a regulation then\nunder review in the lower courts. See Reply Brief for 29 States and\nState Agencies in No. 15A773, p.\u00a033 (conceding the point). The\neffect of the Court\u2019s order, followed by the Trump administration\u2019s\nrepeal of the rule, was that the Clean Power Plan never went into\neffect. The ensuing years, though, proved the Plan\u2019s moderation.\nMarket forces alone caused the power industry to meet the Plan\u2019s\nnationwide emissions target\u2014through exactly the kinds of generation\nshifting the Plan contemplated. See 84 Fed. Reg. 32561\u201332562\n(2019); Brief for United States 47. So by the time yet another\nPresident took office, the Plan had become, as a practical matter,\nobsolete. For that reason, the Biden administration announced that,\ninstead of putting the Plan into effect, it would commence a new\nrulemaking. Yet this Court determined to pronounce on the legality\nof the old rule anyway. The Court may be right that doing so does\nnot violate Article III mootness rules (which are notoriously\nstrict). Seeante, at 14\u201316. But the Court\u2019s docket is\ndiscretionary, and because no one is now subject to the Clean Power\nPlan\u2019s terms, there was no reason to reach out to decide this case.\nThe Court today issues what is really an advisory opinion on the\nproper scope of the new rule EPA is considering. That new rule will\nbe subject anyway to immediate, pre-enforcement judicial review.\nBut this Court could not wait\u2014even to see what the new rule says\u2014to\nconstrain EPA\u2019s efforts to address climate change.The limits the majority now puts on EPA\u2019s\nauthority fly in the face of the statute Congress wrote. The\nmajority says it is simply \u201cnot plausible\u201d that Congress enabled\nEPA to regulate power plants\u2019 emissions through generation\nshifting.Ante, at 31. But that is just what Congress did\nwhen it broadly authorized EPA in Section 111 to select the \u201cbest\nsystem of emission reduction\u201d for power plants. \u00a77411(a)(1). The\n\u201cbest system\u201d full stop\u2014no ifs, ands, or buts of any kind relevant\nhere. The parties do not dispute that generation shifting is indeed\nthe \u201cbest system\u201d\u2014the most effective and efficient way to reduce\npower plants\u2019 carbon dioxide emissions. And no other provision in\nthe Clean Air Act suggests that Congress meant to foreclose EPA\nfrom selecting that system; to the contrary, the Plan\u2019s regulatory\napproach fits hand-in-glove with the rest of the statute. The\nmajority\u2019s decision rests on one claim alone: that generation\nshifting is just too new and too big a deal for Congress to have\nauthorized it in Section 111\u2019s general terms. But that is wrong. A\nkey reason Congress makes broad delegations like Section 111 is so\nan agency can respond, appropriately and commensurately, to new and\nbig problems. Congress knows what it doesn\u2019t and can\u2019t know when it\ndrafts a statute; and Congress therefore gives an expert agency the\npower to address issues\u2014even significant ones\u2014as and when they\narise. That is what Congress did in enacting Section 111. The\nmajority today overrides that legislative choice. In so doing, it\ndeprives EPA of the power needed\u2014and the power granted\u2014to curb the\nemission of greenhouse gases.IThe Clean Air Act was major legislation,\ndesigned to deal with a major public policy issue. As Congress\nexplained, its goal was to \u201cspeed up, expand, and intensify the war\nagainst air pollution\u201d in all its forms. H.\u00a0R. Rep. No.\n91\u20131146, p.\u00a01 (1970). Or as this Court similarly recognized,\nthe Act was a \u201cdrastic remedy to what was perceived as a serious\nand otherwise uncheckable problem.\u201dUnion Elec. Co.v.EPA,427 U.S.\n246, 256 (1976). The Act, as the majority describes,\nestablished three major regulatory programs to control air\npollution from stationary sources like power plants. Seeante, at 2\u20136. The National Ambient Air Quality Standards\n(NAAQS) and Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAP) programs prescribe\nstandards for specified pollutants, not including carbon dioxide.\nSection 111\u2019s New Source Performance Standards program provides an\nadditional tool for regulating emissions from categories of\nstationary sources deemed to contribute significantly to pollution.\nAs applied to existing (not new) sources, the program mandates\u2014via\nSection 111(d)\u2014that EPA set emissions levels for pollutants not\ncovered by the NAAQS or HAP programs, including carbon dioxide.Section 111(d) thus ensures that EPA regulates\nexisting power plants\u2019 emissions ofallpollutants. When the\npollutant at issue falls within the NAAQS or HAP programs, EPA need\ndo no more. But when the pollutant falls outside those programs,\nSection 111(d) requires EPA to set an emissions level for currently\noperating power plants (and other stationary sources). That means\nno pollutant from such a source can go unregulated: As the Senate\nReport explained, Section 111(d) guarantees that \u201cthere should be\nno gaps in control activities pertaining to stationary source\nemissions that pose any significant danger to public health or\nwelfare.\u201d S. Rep. No. 91\u20131196, p.\u00a020 (1970). Reflecting that\nlanguage, the majority calls Section 111(d) a \u201cgap-filler.\u201dAnte, at 5. It might also be thought of as a backstop or\ncatch-all provision, protecting against pollutants that the NAAQS\nand HAP programs let go by. But the section isnot, as the\nmajority further claims, an \u201cancillary provision\u201d or a statutory\n\u201cbackwater.\u201dAnte, at 20, 26. That characterization is a\nnon-sequitur. That something is a backstop does not make it a\nbackwater. Even if they are needed only infrequently, seeante, at 6, 20, backstops can perform a critical\nfunction\u2014and this one surely does. Again, Section 111(d) tells EPA\nthat when a pollutant\u2014like carbon dioxide\u2014is not regulated through\nother programs, EPA must undertake a further regulatory effort to\ncontrol that substance\u2019s emission from existing stationary sources.\nIn that way, Section 111(d) operates to ensure that the Act\nachieves comprehensive pollution control.Section 111 describes the prescribed regulatory\neffort in expansive terms. EPA must set for the relevant source\n(here, fossil-fuel-fired power plants) and the relevant pollutant\n(here, carbon dioxide) an emission level\u2014more particularly,\u201cthe degree of emission limitation\nachievable through the application of the best system of emission\nreduction which (taking into account the cost of achieving such\nreduction and any nonair quality health and environmental impact\nand energy requirements) the [EPA] Administrator determines has\nbeen adequately demonstrated.\u201d \u00a77411(a)(1).To take that language apart a bit, the provision\ninstructs EPA to decide upon the \u201cbest system of emission reduction\nwhich .\u00a0.\u00a0. has been adequately demonstrated.\u201d The\nprovision tells EPA, in making that determination, to take account\nof both costs and varied \u201cnonair\u201d impacts (on health, the\nenvironment, and the supply of energy). And the provision finally\ndirects EPA to set the particular emissions limit achievable\nthrough use of the demonstrated \u201cbest system.\u201d Taken as a whole,\nthe section provides regulatory flexibility and discretion. It\nimposes, to be sure, meaningful constraints: Take into account\ncosts and nonair impacts, and make sure the best system has a\nproven track record.[1] But the\ncore command\u2014go find the best system of emission reduction\u2014gives\nbroad authority to EPA.If that flexibility is not apparent on the\nprovision\u2019s face, consider some dictionary definitions\u2014supposedly a\nstaple of this Court\u2019s supposedly textualist method of reading\nstatutes. A \u201csystem\u201d is \u201ca complex unity formed of many often\ndiverse parts subject to a common plan or serving a common\npurpose.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 2322 (1971).\nOr again: a \u201csystem\u201d is \u201c[a]n organized and coordinated method; a\nprocedure.\u201d American Heritage Dictionary 1768 (5th ed. 2018). The\nmajority complains that a similar definition\u2014cited to the Solicitor\nGeneral\u2019s brief but originally from another dictionary\u2014is just too\ndarn broad.Ante, at 28; see Brief for United States 31\n(quoting Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary 2562 (2d ed.\n1959)). \u201c[A]lmost anything\u201d capable of reducing emissions, the\nmajority says, \u201ccould constitute such a \u2018system\u2019\u00a0\u201d of emission\nreduction.Ante, at 28. But that is rather the point.\nCongress used an obviously broad word (though surrounding it with\nconstraints, seesupra, at 7) to give EPA lots of latitude\nin deciding how to set emissions limits. And contra the majority, a\nbroad term is not the same thing as a \u201cvague\u201d one.Ante, at\n18, 20, 28. A broad term is comprehensive, extensive, wide-ranging;\na \u201cvague\u201d term is unclear, ambiguous, hazy. (Once again,\ndictionaries would tell the tale.) So EPA was quite right in\nstating in the Clean Power Plan that the \u201c[p]lain meaning\u201d of the\nterm \u201csystem\u201d in Section 111 refers to \u201ca set of measures that work\ntogether to reduce emissions.\u201d 80 Fed. Reg. 64762. Another of this\nCourt\u2019s opinions, involving a matter other than the bogeyman of\nenvironmental regulation, might have stopped there.For generation shifting fits comfortably within\nthe conventional meaning of a \u201csystem of emission reduction.\u201d\nConsider one of the most common mechanisms of generation shifting:\nthe use of a cap-and-trade scheme. Here is how the majority\ndescribes cap and trade: \u201cUnder such a scheme, sources that receive\na reduction in their emissions can sell a credit representing the\nvalue of that reduction to others, who are able to count it toward\ntheir own applicable emissions caps.\u201dAnte, at 8\u20139. Does\nthat sound like a \u201csystem\u201d to you? It does to me too. And it also\nhas to this Court. In the past, we have explained that \u201c[t]his type\nof \u2018cap-and-trade\u2019systemcuts costs while still reducing\npollution to target levels.\u201dEPAv.EME Homer City\nGeneration, L.\u00a0P.,572 U.S.\n489, 503, n.\u00a010 (2014) (emphasis added). So what does the\nmajority mean when it says that \u201c[a]s a matter of definitionalpossibilities, generation shiftingcanbe described\nas a \u2018system\u2019\u00a0\u201d?Ante, at 28 (emphasis added; citation\nand some internal quotation marks omitted). Rarely has a statutory\nterm so clearly applied.Other statutory provisions confirm the point.\nThe Clean Air Act\u2019s acid rain provision, for example, describes a\ncap-and-trade program as an \u201cemission allocation and transfersystem.\u201d \u00a77651(b) (emphasis added). So a \u201csystem,\u201d according\nto the statute\u2019s own usage, includes the kind of cap-and-trade\nmechanism that the Clean Power Plan relied on. And in a somewhat\ndifferent way, the NAAQS provision shows that Section 111\nencompasses such a regulatory technique. Under that provision,\ncap-and-trade schemes qualify as \u201ccontrol measures, means, or\ntechniques\u201d that state plans may use to reduce emissions.\n\u00a77410(a)(2)(A). That language, of course, does not use the word\n\u201csystem.\u201d But in specifying that cap and trade is allowable under\nthe NAAQS program, the provision supports the same conclusion\nhere\u2014because Section 111 directs EPA to use \u201ca procedure similar to\nthat provided by [the NAAQS].\u201d \u00a77411(d)(1). The majority discounts\nthe relevance of both those provisions on the ground that they\ncontemplate trading systems only \u201cas a means ofcomplyingwith analready established emissions limit.\u201dAnte,\nat 29 (emphasis in original). That is a distinction, to be sure.\nBut to begin, it is far less of one than the majority thinks: In\narguing that EPA\u2019s claim of authority here would allow it to take\nthe emissions limit as low as it wants, the majority ignores the\nvaried constraints surrounding the \u201cbest system\u201d language. Seesupra, at 7. And still more important for interpretive\npurposes, the distinction appears only in the majority\u2019s opinion,\nnot in any statutory language. That text, to the contrary, says to\nEPA: Do as you would do under the NAAQS and Acid Rain programs\u2014go\nahead and use cap and trade.There is also a flipside point: Congress\ndeclined to include in Section 111 the restrictions on EPA\u2019s\nauthority contained in other Clean Air Act provisions. Most\nrelevant here, quite a number of statutory sections confine EPA\u2019s\nemissions- reduction efforts to technological controls\u2014essentially,\nequipment or processes that can be put into place at a particular\nfacility. Seeante, at 4 (describing those controls). So,\nfor example, one provision tells EPA to set standards \u201creflect[ing]\nthe greatest degree of emission reduction achievable through the\napplication of technology.\u201d \u00a77521(a)(3)(A)(i). Others direct the\nuse of the \u201cbest available retrofit technology,\u201d or the \u201cbest\navailable control technology,\u201d or the \u201cmaximum achievable control\ntechnology.\u201d \u00a7\u00a77491(b)(2)(A), (g)(2), 7475(a)(4), 7479(3),\n7412(g)(2). There are still more. See,e.g., \u00a7\u00a77411(h),\n7511a(c)(7), 7651f(b)(2). None of those provisions would allow EPA\nto set emissions limits based on generation shifting, as the Agency\nacknowledges. See Brief for United States 32\u201333. But nothing like\nthe language of those provisions is included in Section 111. That\nmatters under normal rules of statutory interpretation. As Justice\nScalia once wrote for the Court: \u201cWe do not lightly assume that\nCongress has omitted from its adopted text requirements that it\nnonetheless intends to apply, and our reluctance is even greater\nwhen Congress has shown elsewhere in the same statute that it knows\nhow to make such a requirement manifest.\u201dJamav.Immigration and Customs Enforcement,543\nU.S. 335, 341 (2005).Statutory history serves only to pile on: It\nshows that Congress has specifically declined to restrict EPA to\ntechnology-based controls in its regulation of existing stationary\nsources. The key moment came in 1977, when Congress amended Section\n111 to distinguish between new sources and existing ones. For new\nsources, EPA could select only the \u201cbesttechnologicalsystem of continuous emission reduction.\u201d Clean Air Act Amendments,\n\u00a7109(c)(1)(A), 91Stat. 700 (emphasis added). But for existing\nsources, the word \u201ctechnological\u201d was struck out: EPA could select\nthe \u201cbest system of continuous emission reduction.\u201dIbid.The House Report emphasized Congress\u2019s deliberate choice: Whereas\nthe standards set for new sources were to be based on \u201cthe best\ntechnological\u201d controls, the \u201cstandards adopted for existing\nsources\u201d were \u201cto be based on available means of emission control\n(not necessarily technological).\u201d H. R. Rep. No. 95\u2013564,\np.\u00a0129 (1977). The Report did not further explain the\ndistinction. But presumably Congress gave EPA more flexibility over\nexisting plants because imposing technological controls on old\nfacilities is often not cost- effective.[2] Thirteen years later, Congress followed up by\ndeleting from Section 111 the technological limitation applying to\nnew facilities. See Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, \u00a7403(a),\n104Stat. 2631. Once again, then, Congress faced a choice: confine\nEPA to technological controls, or not. And replicating its earlier\naction for existing sources, Congress chose not.The majority breezes past that congressional\nchoice on the ground that today\u2019s opinion does not resolve whether\nEPA can regulate in some non-technological ways; instead, the\nopinion says only that the Clean Power Plan goes too far. Seeante, at 30\u201331. That is a puzzling point. As an initial\nmatter, it recharacterizes what this case has always been about.\nThe Trump administration repealed the Clean Power Plan for one\ncentral reason: because (in its view) Section 111 confines EPA to\nfacility-specific, technological measures. See 84 Fed. Reg.\n32523\u201332529. In reviewing that repeal, the court below thus\naddressed that limit alone. SeeAmerican Lung Assn.v.EPA, 985 F.3d 914, 944 (CADC 2021). So add to the oddity of\nthe Court\u2019s declaring a defunct regulation unlawful, seesupra, at 4, the irregularity of its suggesting some kind of\nnon-technological limit that no one (not EPA, not the parties, not\nthe court below) has ever considered. More important here, both the\nnature and the statutory basis of that limit are left a mystery. If\nthe majority is not distinguishing between technological controls\nand all others, what is it doing\u2014and how far does its opinion\nconstrain EPA? The majority makes no effort to say. And because\nthat is so, the majority cannot even attempt to ground its limit in\nthe statutory language. I\u2019ve just shown that restricting EPA to\ntechnological controls is inconsistent with Section 111, especially\nwhen read in conjunction with other statutory provisions. And the\nmajority provides no reason to think that its (possibly) different\nlimit fares any better. Section 111 does not imposeanyconstraints\u2014technological or otherwise\u2014on EPA\u2019s authority to\nregulate stationary sources (except for those stated, like cost).\nIn somehow (and to some extent) saying otherwise, the majority\nflouts the statutory text.\u201cCongress,\u201d this Court has said, \u201cknows to speak\nin plain terms when it wishes to circumscribe, and in capacious\nterms when it wishes to enlarge, agency discretion.\u201dArlingtonv.FCC,569 U.S.\n290, 296 (2013). In Section 111, Congress spoke in capacious\nterms. It knew that \u201cwithout regulatory flexibility, changing\ncircumstances and scientific developments would soon render the\nClean Air Act obsolete.\u201dMassachusetts, 549 U.\u00a0S., at\n532. So the provision enables EPA to base emissions limits for\nexisting stationary sources on the \u201cbest system.\u201d That system may\nbe technological in nature; it may be whatever else the majority\nhas in mind; or, most important here, it may be generation\nshifting. The statute does not care. And when Congress uses\n\u201cexpansive language\u201d to authorize agency action, courts generally\nmay not \u201cimpos[e] limits on [the] agency\u2019s discretion.\u201dLittle\nSisters of the Poor Saints Peter and Paul Homev.Pennsylvania, 591 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2020) (slip op., at\n16). That constraint on judicial authority\u2014that insistence on\njudicial modesty\u2014should resolve this case.IIThe majority thinks not, contending that in\n\u201ccertain extraordinary cases\u201d\u2014of which this is one\u2014courts should\nstart off with \u201cskepticism\u201d that a broad delegation authorizes\nagency action.Ante, at 19. The majority labels that view\nthe \u201cmajor questions doctrine,\u201d and claims to find support for it\nin our caselaw.Ante, at 19\u201320, 28. But the relevant\ndecisions do normal statutory interpretation: In them, the Court\nsimply insisted that the text of a broad delegation, like any other\nstatute, should be read in context, and with a modicum of common\nsense. Using that ordinary method, the decisions struck down agency\nactions (even though they plausibly fit within a delegation\u2019s\nterms) for two principal reasons. First, an agency was operating\nfar outside its traditional lane, so that it had no viable claim of\nexpertise or experience. And second, the action, if allowed, would\nhave conflicted with, or even wreaked havoc on, Congress\u2019s broader\ndesign. In short, the assertion of delegated power was a misfit for\nboth the agency and the statutory scheme. But that is not true\nhere. The Clean Power Plan falls within EPA\u2019s wheelhouse, and it\nfits perfectly\u2014as I\u2019ve just shown\u2014with all the Clean Air Act\u2019s\nprovisions. That the Plan addresses major issues of public policy\ndoes not upend the analysis. Congress wanted EPA to do just that.\nSection 111 entrusts important matters to EPA in the expectation\nthat the Agency will use that authority to combat pollution\u2014and\nthat courts will not interfere.A\u201c[T]he words of a statute,\u201d as the majority\nstates, \u201cmust be read in their context and with a view to their\nplace in the overall statutory scheme.\u201dFDAv.Brown\n& Williamson Tobacco Corp.,529 U.S.\n120, 133 (2000); seeante, at 16. We do not assess the\nmeaning of a single word, phrase, or provision in isolation; we\nalso consider the overall statutory design. And that is just as\ntrue of statutes broadly delegating power to agencies as of any\nother kind. In deciding on the scope of such a delegation, courts\nmust assess how an agency action claimed to fall within the\nprovision fits with other aspects of a statutory plan.So too, a court \u201cmust be guided to a degree by\ncommon sense as to the manner in which Congress is likely to\ndelegate.\u201dBrown & Williamson, 529 U.\u00a0S., at 133.\nAssume that a policy decision, like this one, is a matter of\nsignificant \u201ceconomic and political magnitude.\u201dIbid.We\nknow that Congress delegates such decisions to agencies all the\ntime\u2014and often via broadly framed provisions like Section 111. Seeinfra, at 29\u201331. But Congress does so in a sensible way. To\ndecide whether an agency action goes beyond what Congress wanted,\ncourts must assess (among other potentially relevant factors) the\nnature of the regulation, the nature of the agency, and the\nrelationship of the two to each other. See,e.g.,Barnhartv.Walton,535 U.S.\n212, 222 (2002). In particular, we have understood, Congress\ndoes not usually grant agencies the authority to decide significant\nissues on which they have no particular expertise. So when there is\na mismatch between the agency\u2019s usual portfolio and a given\nassertion of power, courts have reason to question whether Congress\nintended a delegation to go so far.The majority today goes beyond those sensible\nprinciples. It announces the arrival of the \u201cmajor questions\ndoctrine,\u201d which replaces normal text-in-context statutory\ninterpretation with some tougher-to-satisfy set of rules.Ante, at 16\u201331. Apparently, there is now a two-step inquiry.\nFirst, a court must decide, by looking at some panoply of factors,\nwhether agency action presents an \u201cextraordinary case[\u00a0].\u201dAnte, at 17; seeante, at 20\u201328. If it does, the\nagency \u201cmust point to clear congressional authorization for the\npower it claims,\u201d someplace over and above the normal statutory\nbasis we require.Ante, at 19 (internal quotation marks\nomitted); seeante, at 28\u201331. The result is statutory\ninterpretation of an unusual kind. It is not until page 28 of a\n31-page opinion that the majority begins to seriously discuss the\nmeaning of Section 111. And even then, it does not address\nstraight-up what should be the question: Does the text of that\nprovision, when read in context and with a common-sense awareness\nof how Congress delegates, authorize the agency action here?The majority claims it is just following\nprecedent, but that is not so. The Court has never even used the\nterm \u201cmajor questions doctrine\u201d before. And in the relevant cases,\nthe Court has done statutory construction of a familiar sort. It\nhas looked to the text of a delegation. It has addressed how an\nagency\u2019s view of that text works\u2014or fails to do so\u2014in the context\nof a broader statutory scheme. And it has asked, in a\ncommon-sensical (or call it purposive) vein, about what Congress\nwould have made of the agency\u2019s view\u2014otherwise said, whether\nCongress would naturally have delegated authority over some\nimportant question to the agency, given its expertise and\nexperience. In short, in assessing the scope of a delegation, the\nCourt has considered\u2014without multiple steps, triggers, or special\npresumptions\u2014the fit between the power claimed, the agency claiming\nit, and the broader statutory design.The key case here isFDAv.Brown\n& Williamson. There, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\nasserted that its power to regulate \u201cdrugs\u201d and \u201cdevices\u201d extended\nto tobacco products. The claim had something to it: FDA has broad\nauthority over \u201cdrugs\u201d and drug-delivery \u201cdevices,\u201d and the\ndefinitions of those terms could be read to encompass nicotine and\ncigarettes. But the asserted authority \u201csimply [did] not fit\u201d the\noverall statutory scheme. 529 U.\u00a0S., at 143. FDA\u2019s governing\nstatute required the agency to ensure that regulated products were\n\u201csafe\u201d to be marketed\u2014but there was no making tobacco products safe\nin the usual sense.Id., at 133\u2013143. So FDA would have had\nto reinterpret what it meant to be \u201csafe,\u201d or else ban tobacco\nproducts altogether.Ibid.Both options, the Court thought,\nwere preposterous. Until the agency action at issue, tobacco\nproducts hadn\u2019t been spoken of in the same breath as\npharmaceuticals (FDA\u2019s paradigmatic regulated product). And\nCongress had created in several statutes a \u201cdistinct regulatory\nscheme\u201d for tobacco, not involving FDA.Id., at 155\u2013156. So\nall the evidence was that Congress had never meant for FDA to have\nany\u2014let alone total\u2014control over the tobacco industry, with its\n\u201cunique political history.\u201dId., at 159. Again, there was\n\u201csimply\u201d a lack of \u201cfit\u201d between the regulation at issue, the\nagency in question, and the broader statutory scheme.Id.,\nat 143.The majority\u2019s effort to find support inBrown & Williamsonfor its interpretive approach fails.\nSeeante, at 19. It may be helpful here to quote the full\nsentence that the majority quotes half of. \u201cIn extraordinary\ncases,\u201d the Court stated, \u201cthere may be reason to hesitate before\nconcluding that Congress has intended such an implicit delegation.\u201d\n529 U.\u00a0S., at 159. For anyone familiar with this Court\u2019sChevrondoctrine, that language will ring a bell. The Court\nwas saying only\u2014and it was elsewhere explicit on this point\u2014that\nthere was reason to hesitate before giving FDA\u2019s positionChevrondeference. Seeid., at 132\u2013133, 159\u2013161. And\nwhat was that reason? The Court went on to explain that it would\nnot defer to FDA because it read the relevant statutory provisions\nas negating the agency\u2019s claimed authority. Seeid., at 160\n(\u201c[W]e are obliged to defer not to the agency\u2019s expansive\nconstruction of the statute, but to Congress\u2019 consistent judgment\nto deny the FDA this power\u201d);id., at 133 (finding atChevron\u2019s first step that \u201cCongress has directly spoken to\nthe issue here and precluded the FDA\u2019s\u201d asserted power). In\nreaching that conclusion, the Court relied (as I\u2019ve just explained)\nnot on any special \u201cclear authorization\u201d demand, but on normal\nprinciples of statutory interpretation: look at the text, view it\nin context, and use what the Court called some \u201ccommon sense\u201d about\nhow Congress delegates.Ibid.Thatis how courts are\nto decide, in the majority\u2019s language, whether an agency has\nasserted a \u201chighly consequential power beyond what Congress could\nreasonably be understood to have granted.\u201dAnte, at 20.The Court has applied the same kind of analysis\nin subsequent cases\u2014holding in each that an agency exceeded the\nscope of a broadly framed delegation when it operated outside the\nsphere of its expertise, in a way that warped the statutory text or\nstructure. InGonzalesv.Oregon,546 U.S.\n243(2006), we rejected the Attorney General\u2019s assertion of\nauthority (under a broad \u201cpublic interest\u201d standard) to rescind\ndoctors\u2019 registrations for facilitating assisted suicide, even in\nStates where doing so was legal. Seeid., at 243, 248\u2013249,\n261\u2013275. We doubted Congress would have delegated such a\n\u201cquintessentially medical judgment[\u00a0]\u201d to \u201can executive\nofficial who lacks medical expertise.\u201dId., at 266\u2013267. And\nwe pointed to statutory provisions in which Congress\u2014in opposition\nto the claimed power\u2014had \u201cpainstakingly described the Attorney\nGeneral\u2019s limited authority\u201d to deregister physicians.Id.,\nat 262.[3]Later, inUtility Air Regulatory Groupv.EPA,573 U.S.\n302(2014), the Court relied on similar reasoning to reject\nEPA\u2019s efforts to regulate \u201cmillions of small\u201d and previously\nunregulated sources of emissions\u2014\u201cincluding retail stores, offices,\napartment buildings, shopping centers, schools, and churches.\u201dId., at 328. Key to that decision was the Court\u2019s view that\nreading the delegation so expansively would be \u201cinconsistent with\u201d\nthe statute\u2019s broader \u201cstructure and design.\u201dId., at 321.\nThe Court explained that allowing the agency action to proceed\nwould necessitate the \u201crewriting\u201d of other \u201cunambiguous statutory\nterms\u201d\u2014indeed, of \u201cprecise numerical thresholds.\u201dId., at\n321, 325\u2013326. (In quoting one cryptic sentence ofUtility\nAiras supporting its new approach, seeante, at 19, the\nmajority ignores the nine preceding pages of analysis of the\nstatute\u2019s text and context, see 573 U.\u00a0S., at 315\u2013324.)And last Term, the Court concluded that the\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lacked the power\nto impose a nationwide eviction moratorium.Alabama Assn. of\nRealtorsv.Department of Health and Human Servs., 594\nU.\u00a0S. ___, ___\u2013___ (2021) (slip op., at 5\u20137). The Court held\nthat other statutory language made it a \u201cstretch\u201d to read the\nrelied-on delegation as covering the CDC\u2019s action.Id., at\n___ (slip op., at 6). And the Court raised an eyebrow at the\nthought of the CDC \u201cintrud[ing]\u201d into \u201cthe landlord-tenant\nrelationship\u201d\u2014a matter outside the CDC\u2019s usual \u201cdomain.\u201dIbid.[4]The eyebrow-raise is indeed a consistent\npresence in these cases, responding to something the Court found\nanomalous\u2014looked at from Congress\u2019s point of view\u2014in a particular\nagency\u2019s exercise of authority. In each case, the Court thought,\nthe agency had strayed out of its lane, to an area where it had\nneither expertise nor experience. The Attorney General making\nhealthcare policy, the regulator of pharmaceutical concerns\ndeciding the fate of the tobacco industry, and so on. And in each\ncase, the proof that the agency had roamed too far afield lay in\nthe statutory scheme itself. The agency action collided with other\nstatutory provisions; if the former were allowed, the latter could\nnot mean what they said or could not work as intended. FDA having\nto declare tobacco \u201csafe\u201d to avoid shutting down an industry; or\nEPA having literally to change hard numbers contained in the Clean\nAir Act. There, according to the Court, the statutory framework was\n\u201cnot designed to grant\u201d the authority claimed.Utility Air,\n573 U.\u00a0S., at 324. The agency\u2019s \u201csingular\u201d assertion of power\n\u201cwould render the statute unrecognizable to the Congress\u201d that\nwrote it.Ibid.(internal quotation marks omitted).BThe Court today faces no such singular\nassertion of agency power. As I have already explained, nothing in\nthe Clean Air Act (or, for that matter, any other statute)\nconflicts with EPA\u2019s reading of Section 111. Notably, the majority\ndoes not dispute that point. Of course, it views Section 111 (if\nfor unexplained reasons) as less clear than I do. Compareante, at 28, withsupra, at 7\u20139. But nowhere does the\nmajority provide evidence from within the statute itself that the\nClean Power Plan conflicts with or undermines Congress\u2019s design.\nThat fact alone makes this case different from all the cases\ndescribed above. As to the other critical matter in those cases\u2014is\nthe agency operating outside its sphere of expertise?\u2014the majority\nat least tries to say something. It claims EPA has no \u201ccomparative\nexpertise\u201d in \u201cbalancing the many vital considerations of national\npolicy\u201d implicated in regulating electricity sources.Ante,\nat 25\u201326. But that is wrong.Start with what this Court has said before on\nthe subject, reflecting Congress\u2019s view of the matter. About a\ndecade ago, we recognized that Congress had \u201cdelegated to EPA\u201d in\nSection 111 \u201cthe decision whether and how to regulate\ncarbon-dioxide emissions from powerplants.\u201dAmerican Elec.\nPower, 564 U.\u00a0S., at 426. To stress the key word (because\nthe majority seems to miss it, seeante, at 26\u201327): not\nmerely \u201cwhether\u201d but also \u201chow.\u201d In making that delegation, we\nexplained, Congress knew well what it was doing. Regulating power\nplant emissions is a complex undertaking. To do it right requires\n\u201cinformed assessment of competing interests\u201d: \u201cAlong with the\nenvironmental benefit potentially achievable, our Nation\u2019s energy\nneeds and the possibility of economic disruption must weigh in the\nbalance.\u201d 564 U.\u00a0S., at 427; see \u00a77411(a)(1) (instructing EPA\nto consider \u201cenergy requirements,\u201d \u201ccost,\u201d and other factors).\nCongress specifically \u201centrust[ed] such complex balancing to EPA,\u201d\nbecause that \u201cexpert agency\u201d has the needed \u201cscientific, economic,\nand technological resources\u201d to carry it out. 564 U.\u00a0S., at\n427\u2013428. So the balancing\u2014including of the Nation\u2019s \u201cenergy\nrequirements\u201d\u2014that the majority says EPA has no \u201ccomparative\nexpertise\u201d in? \u00a77411(a)(1);ante, at 25. We explained 11\nshort years ago, citing Congress, that it was smack in the middle\nof EPA\u2019s wheelhouse.And we were right. Consider the Clean Power\nPlan\u2019s component parts\u2014let\u2019s call them the what, who, and how\u2014to\nsee the rule\u2019s normalcy. The \u201cwhat\u201d is the subject matter of the\nPlan: carbon dioxide emissions. This Court has already found that\nthose emissions fall within EPA\u2019s domain. We said then: \u201c[T]here is\nnothing counterintuitive to the notion that EPA can curtail the\nemission of substances that are putting the global climate out of\nkilter.\u201dMassachusetts, 549 U.\u00a0S., at 531. This is not\nthe Attorney General regulating medical care, or even the CDC\nregulating landlord- tenant relations. It is EPA (that\u2019s the\nEnvironmental Protection Agency, in case the majority forgot)\nacting to address the greatest environmental challenge of our time.\nSo too, there is nothing special about the Plan\u2019s \u201cwho\u201d:\nfossil-fuel-fired power plants. InUtility Air, we thought\nEPA\u2019s regulation of churches and schools highly unusual. Seesupra, at 18. But fossil-fuel-fired plants? Those plants\npollute\u2014a lot\u2014and so they have long lived under the watchful eye of\nEPA. That was true even before EPA began regulating carbon dioxide.\nSeeTrainv.Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,421 U.S.\n60, 78 (1975).Finally, the \u201chow\u201d of generation shifting\ncreates no mismatch with EPA\u2019s expertise. As the Plan noted,\ngeneration shifting has a well-established pedigree as a tool for\nreducing pollution; even putting aside other federal regulation,\nseeinfra, at 25\u201326, both state regulators and power plants\nthemselves have long used it to attain environmental goals. See 80\nFed. Reg. 64664; Brief for Power Company Respondents 47; see also\nS. Breyer, Regulation and Its Reform 444, n.\u00a01 (1982) (citing\nliterature on the subject from the 1970s). The technique is, so to\nspeak, a tool in the pollution-control toolbox. And that toolbox is\nthe one EPA uses. So that Agency, more than any other, has the\ndesired \u201ccomparative expertise.\u201dAnte, at 25. The majority\ncannot contest that point frontally: It knows that cap and trade\nand similar mechanisms are an ordinary part of modern environmental\nregulation. Instead, the majority protests that Congress would not\nhave wanted EPA to \u201cdictat[e],\u201d through generation shifting, the\n\u201cmix of energy sources nationwide.\u201dAnte, at 26. But that\nstatement reflects a misunderstanding of how the electricity market\nworks.Everyregulation of power plants\u2014even the most\nconventional, facility- specific controls\u2014\u201cdictat[es]\u201d the national\nenergy mix to one or another degree. That result follows because\nregulations affect costs, and the electrical grid works by taking\nup energy from low-cost providers before high-cost ones. Consider\nan example: Suppose EPA requires coal-fired plants to use\ncarbon-capture technology. That action increases those plants\u2019\ncosts, and automatically (by virtue of the way the grid operates)\nreduces their share of the electricity market. So EPA is always\ncontrolling the mix of energy sources. In that sense (though the\nterm has taken on a more specialized meaning), everything EPA does\nis \u201cgeneration shifting.\u201d The majority\u2019s idea that EPA has no\nwarrant to direct such a shift just indicates that courts sometimes\ndo not really get regulation.[5]Why, then, be \u201cskeptic[al]\u201d of EPA\u2019s exercise of\nauthority?Ante, at 28. When there is no misfit, of the kind\napparent in our precedents, between the regulation, the agency, and\nthe statutory design? Although the majority offers a flurry of\ncomplaints, they come down in the end to this: The Clean Power Plan\nis a big new thing, issued under a minor statutory provision. Seeante, at 20, 24, 26 (labeling the Plan \u201ctransformative\u201d and\n\u201cunprecedented\u201d and calling Section 111(d) an \u201cancillary\u201d\n\u201cbackwater\u201d). I have already addressed the back half of that\nargument: In fact, there is nothing insignificant about Section\n111(d), which was intended to ensure that EPA would limit existing\nstationary sources\u2019 emissions of otherwise unregulated pollutants\n(however few or many there were). Seesupra, at 6. And the\nfront half of the argument doesn\u2019t work either. The Clean Power\nPlan was not so big. It was not so new. And to the extent it was\neither, that should not matter.As to bigness\u2014well, events have proved the\nopposite: The Clean Power Plan, we now know, would have had little\nor no impact. The Trump administration\u2019s repeal of the Plan created\na kind of controlled experiment: The Plan\u2019s \u201cmagnitude\u201d\n(ante, at 24) could be measured by seeing how far short the\nindustry fell of the Plan\u2019s nationwide emissions target. Except\nthat turned out to be the wrong question, because the industry\ndidn\u2019t fall short of the Plan\u2019s goal; rather, the industry exceeded\nthat target, all on its own. See App. 265 (declaration of EPA\nofficial). And it did so mainly through the generation-shifting\ntechniques that the Plan called for. Seeibid.; Brief for\nUnited States 47. In effect, the Plan predicted market behavior,\nrather than altered it (as regulations usually do). Cf.Utility\nAir, 573 U.\u00a0S., at 321\u2013322 (discussing the \u201ccalamitous\nconsequences\u201d of the EPA approach there under review). And that\nfact has been understood for some years. At the time of the repeal,\nthe Trump administration explained that \u201cthere [was] likely to be\nno difference between a world where the [Clean Power Plan was]\nimplemented and one where it [was] not.\u201d 84 Fed. Reg.\n32561.[6] It is small wonder,\nthen, that the power industry overwhelmingly supports EPA in this\ncase. See Brief for Power Company Respondents 2\u20133. In the regulated\nparties\u2019 view, the rule aimed to achieve what most power companies\nalso want: substantial reductions in carbon dioxide emissions\naccomplished in a cost-effective way while maintaining a reliable\nelectricity market. Seeid., at 26\u201327, 38, 41\u201342.The majority thus pivots to the massive\nconsequences generation shiftingcouldproduce\u2014but that\nclaim fares just as poorly. On EPA\u2019s view of its own authority, the\nmajority worries, some future rule might \u201cforc[e] coal plants to\n\u2018shift\u2019 away virtually all of their generation\u2014i.e., to\ncease making power altogether.\u201dAnte, at 24. But looking at\nthe text of Section 111(d) might here come in handy. For the\nstatute imposes, as already shown, a set of\nconstraints\u2014particularly involving costs and energy needs\u2014that\nwould preclude so extreme a regulation. See Brief for United States\n41\u201342 (conceding the point);supra, at 7. And if the\nmajority thinks those constraints do not really constrain, then it\nhas a much bigger problem. For \u201ctraditional\u201d technological\ncontrols, of the kind the majority approves, can have equally\ndramatic effects.Ante, at 23. Take, for example, the\n\u201cfuel-switching\u201d regulation the majority mentions.Ibid.Such a rule does just what you might think: It requires a plant to\nburn a different kind of fuel\u2014say, natural gas instead of coal. So\nit too can significantly \u201crestructur[e] the Nation\u2019s overall mix of\nelectricity generation.\u201dAnte, at 16. Or take an even more\ntechnological-sounding approach: the use of carbon-capture\nequipment. Order the installation of that equipment, the Trump\nadministration concluded, and the \u201cexorbitant\u201d costs \u201cwould almost\ncertainly force the closure\u201d of all affected \u201ccoal-fired power\nplants.\u201d 84 Fed. Reg. 32548. The point is a simple one: If\ngeneration shifting can go big, so too can technological controls\n(assuming, once again, that the statute\u2019s text is ignored). The\nproblem (if any exists) is not with the channel, but with the\nvolume.[7]The majority\u2019s claim about the Clean Power\nPlan\u2019s novelty\u2014the most fleshed-out part of today\u2019s opinion, seeante, at 20\u201324\u2014is also exaggerated. As EPA explained when it\nissued the Clean Power Plan, an earlier Section 111(d) regulation\nhad determined that a cap-and-trade program was the \u201cbest system of\nemission reduction\u201d for mercury. 70 Fed. Reg. 28616\u201328621 (2005);\nsee 80 Fed. Reg. 64772. In the majority\u2019s view, that rule was\ndifferent because the \u201cactual emission cap\u201d for the contemplated\ncap-and-trade scheme was based on the use of a plant-specific\ntechnology\u2014namely, wet scrubbers.Ante, at 21 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). But the approval of cap and trade allowed\nEPA to make the emissions limits more stringent than it otherwise\ncould have, because EPA knew that plants unable to cost-effectively\ninstall scrubbers could instead meet the limits through generation\nshifting. See 70 Fed. Reg. 28619. EPA could have designed the Clean\nPower Plan in the same way\u2014say, by setting emissions limits based\non carbon-capture technology, with the expectation that many plants\nwould avail themselves of an approved cap-and-trade program\ninstead. The majority gives no reason to think Section 111(d)\nallows that approach but disallows the Clean Power Plan. In both,\ngeneration shifting is operating to increase the strictness of\nemissions limits.And the mercury rule itself was rooted in\nprecedent. A decade earlier, EPA had determined that States could\ncomply with a Section 111(d) regulation for municipal waste\ncombustors by establishing cap-and-trade programs. See 40 CFR\n\u00a7\u00a760.30a, 60.33b(d)(2) (1996). And beyond Section 111(d), trading\nand other tools of generation shifting become still more common.\nFor decades, EPA has relied on those pollution-control techniques\nin rules covering new internal-combustion engines under Section\n111(b), sources of nitrogen oxide under the NAAQS program, and\nmotor vehicles under Section 202(a). See 73 Fed. Reg. 3595 (2008);\n71 Fed. Reg. 39159 (2006); 63 Fed. Reg. 57358\u201357359 (1998); 48 Fed.\nReg. 33456 (1983); see also Brief for Richard L. Revesz asAmicus Curiae24\u201329 (collecting similar rules). No doubt the\nmajority is right that scrubbers and other \u201cadd-on controls\u201d are\n\u201cmore traditional air pollution control measures.\u201dAnte, at\n23. EPA readily acknowledged that fact in developing the Clean\nPower Plan. But the idea that the Plan\u2019s reliance on generation\nshifting effected some kind of revolution in power-plant pollution\ncontrol? No. As I\u2019ve noted before, power plants themselves use that\nmethod. State environmental regulators use that method. And EPA has\nused that method, including under the statutory provision invoked\nhere.In any event, newness might be perfectly\nlegitimate\u2014even required\u2014from Congress\u2019s point of view. I do not\ndispute that an agency\u2019s longstanding practice may inform a court\u2019s\ninterpretation of a statute delegating the agency power. Seeante, at 20\u201321. But it is equally true, asBrown &\nWilliamsonrecognized, that agency practices are \u201cnot carved in\nstone.\u201d 529 U.\u00a0S., at 156\u2013157 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Congress makes broad delegations in part so that agencies\ncan \u201cadapt their rules and policies to the demands of changing\ncircumstances.\u201dId., at 157. To keep faith with that\ncongressional choice, courts must give agencies \u201cample latitude\u201d to\nrevisit, rethink, and revise their regulatory approaches.Ibid.So it is here. Section 111(d) was written, as I\u2019ve\nshown, to give EPA plenty of leeway. Seesupra, at 6\u20138. The\nenacting Congress told EPA to pick the \u201cbest system of emission\nreduction\u201d (taking into account various factors). In selecting\nthose words, Congress understood\u2014it had to\u2014that the \u201cbest system\u201d\nwould change over time. Congress wanted and instructed EPA to keep\nup. To ensure the statute\u2019s continued effectiveness, the \u201cbest\nsystem\u201d should evolve as circumstances evolved\u2014in a way Congress\nknew it couldn\u2019t then know. SeeMassachusetts, 549\nU.\u00a0S., at 532. EPA followed those statutory directions to the\nletter when it issued the Clean Power Plan. It selected a system\n(as the regulated parties agree) that achieved greater emissions\nreductions at lower cost than any technological alternative could\nhave, while maintaining a reliable electricity market. Even if that\nsystem was novel, it was in EPA\u2019s view better\u2014actually, \u201cbest.\u201d So\nit was the system that accorded with the enacting Congress\u2019s\nchoice.And contra the majority, it is that Congress\u2019s\nchoice which counts, not any later one\u2019s. The majority says it\n\u201ccannot ignore\u201d that Congress in recent years has \u201cconsidered and\nrejected\u201d cap-and-trade schemes.Ante, at 27\u201328. But under\nnormal principles of statutory construction, the majorityshouldignore that fact (just as I should ignore that\nCongress failed to enact bills barring EPA from implementing the\nClean Power Plan). As we have explained time and again, failed\nlegislation \u201coffers a particularly dangerous basis on which to rest\nan interpretation of an existing law a different and earlier\nCongress\u201d adopted.Bostockv.Clayton County, 590\nU.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2020) (slip op., at 20) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted); seeSullivanv.Finkelstein,496 U.S.\n617, 632 (1990) (Scalia, J., concurring in part) (\u201cArguments\nbased on subsequent legislative history\u201d should \u201cnot be taken\nseriously, not even in a footnote\u201d). Return toBrown &\nWilliamson, which all agree is the key case in this sphere. It\ndisclaimed any reliance on \u201cCongress\u2019 failure\u201d to grant FDA\njurisdiction over tobacco. 529 U.\u00a0S., at 155. Instead, the\nCourt focused on the statutes Congress \u201cha[d]enacted,\u201d\nwhich created \u201ca distinct regulatory scheme\u201d for tobacco,\nincompatible with FDA\u2019s.Ibid.(emphasis added). Here, as\nI\u2019ve shown and the majority effectively concedes, there is nothing\nequivalent. Seesupra, at 9\u201312. Search high and low, nothing\nin current law conflicts with, or otherwise casts doubt on, the\nClean Power Plan. That leaves the Court in much the same place it\nwas when decidingMassachusettsv.EPA. Said the\nCourt then: \u201cThat subsequent Congresses have eschewed enacting\nbinding emissions limitations to combat global warming tells us\nnothing about what Congress meant\u201d when it enacted the Clean Air\nAct. 549 U.\u00a0S., at 529\u2013530. And so the Court recognized EPA\u2019s\nauthority to regulate carbon dioxide. But that Court was not this\nCourt; and this Court deprives EPA of the authority Congress gave\nit in Section 111(d) to respond to the same environmental\ndanger.IIISome years ago, I remarked that \u201c[w]e\u2019re all\ntextualists now.\u201d Harvard Law School, The Antonin Scalia Lecture\nSeries: A Dialogue with Justice Elena Kagan on the Reading of\nStatutes (Nov. 25, 2015). It seems I was wrong. The current Court\nis textualist only when being so suits it. When that method would\nfrustrate broader goals, special canons like the \u201cmajor questions\ndoctrine\u201d magically appear as get-out-of-text-free cards.[8] Today, one of those broader goals\nmakes itself clear: Prevent agencies from doing important work,\neven though that is what Congress directed. That\nanti-administrative-state stance shows up in the majority opinion,\nand it suffuses the concurrence. Seeante, at 19, 25\u201326;e.g.,ante, at 3\u20136 (Gorsuch, J., concurring).The kind of agency delegations at issue here go\nall the way back to this Nation\u2019s founding. \u201c[T]he founding era,\u201d\nscholars have shown, \u201cwasn\u2019t concerned about delegation.\u201d E. Posner\n& A. Vermeule, Interring the Nondelegation Doctrine, 69\nU.\u00a0Chi.\u00a0L.\u00a0Rev. 1721, 1734 (2002) (Posner &\nVermeule). The records of the Constitutional Convention, the\nratification debates, the Federalist\u2014none of them suggests any\nsignificant limit on Congress\u2019s capacity to delegate policymaking\nauthority to the Executive Branch. And neither does any early\npractice. The very first Congress gave sweeping authority to the\nExecutive Branch to resolve some of the day\u2019s most pressing\nproblems, including questions of \u201cterritorial administration,\u201d\n\u201cIndian affairs,\u201d \u201cforeign and domestic debt,\u201d \u201cmilitary service,\u201d\nand \u201cthe federal courts.\u201d J. Mortenson & N. Bagley, Delegation\nat the Founding, 121 Colum.\u00a0L.\u00a0Rev. 277, 349 (2021)\n(Mortenson & Bagley). That Congress, to use a few examples,\ngave the Executive power to devise a licensing scheme for trading\nwith Indians; to craft appropriate laws for the Territories; and to\ndecide how to pay down the (potentially ruinous) national debt. Seeid., at 334\u2013338, 340\u2013342, 344\u2013345; C. Chabot, The Lost\nHistory of Delegation at the Founding, 56 Ga.\u00a0L.\u00a0Rev. 81,\n113\u2013134 (2021) (Chabot). Barely anyone objected on delegation\ngrounds. See Mortenson & Bagley 281\u2013282, 332, 339; Chabot\n117\u2013119; Posner & Vermeule 1733\u20131736.It is not surprising that Congress has always\ndelegated, and continues to do so\u2014including on important policy\nissues. As this Court has recognized, it is often \u201cunreasonable and\nimpracticable\u201d for Congress to do anything else.American Power\n& Light Co.v.SEC,329 U.S.\n90, 105 (1946). In all times, but ever more in \u201cour\nincreasingly complex society,\u201d the Legislature \u201csimply cannot do\nits job absent an ability to delegate power under broad general\ndirectives.\u201dMistrettav.United States,488 U.S.\n361, 372 (1989). Consider just two reasons why.First, Members of Congress often don\u2019t know\nenough\u2014and know they don\u2019t know enough\u2014to regulate sensibly on an\nissue. Of course, Members can and do provide overall direction. But\nthen they rely, as all of us rely in our daily lives, on people\nwith greater expertise and experience. Those people are found in\nagencies. Congress looks to them to make specific judgments about\nhow to achieve its more general objectives. And it does so\nespecially, though by no means exclusively, when an issue has a\nscientific or technical dimension. Whywouldn\u2019tCongress\ninstruct EPA to select \u201cthe best system of emission reduction,\u201d\nrather than try to choose that system itself? Congress knows that\nsystems of emission reduction lie not in its own but in EPA\u2019s\n\u201cunique expertise.\u201dMartinv.Occupational Safety and\nHealth Review Comm\u2019n,499 U.S.\n144, 151 (1991).Second and relatedly, Members of Congress often\ncan\u2019t know enough\u2014and again, know they can\u2019t\u2014to keep regulatory\nschemes working across time. Congress usually can\u2019t predict the\nfuture\u2014can\u2019t anticipate changing circumstances and the way they\nwill affect varied regulatory techniques. Nor can Congress\n(realistically) keep track of and respond to fast-flowing\ndevelopments as they occur. Once again, that is most obviously true\nwhen it comes to scientific and technical matters. The \u201cbest system\nof emission reduction\u201d is not today what it was yesterday, and will\nsurely be something different tomorrow. So for this reason too, a\nrational Congress delegates. It enables an agency to adapt old\nregulatory approaches to new times, to ensure that a statutory\nprogram remains effective. See,e.g.,National Federation\nof Independent Businessv.OSHA, 595 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___\n(2022) (Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan, JJ., dissenting) (slip op.,\nat 9) (observing that a statute\u2019s broad language was meant to\nensure that an agency had \u201cthe tools needed to confront emerging\ndangers\u201d).Over time, the administrative delegations\nCongress has made have helped to build a modern Nation. Congress\nwanted fewer workers killed in industrial accidents. It wanted to\nprevent plane crashes, and reduce the deadliness of car wrecks. It\nwanted to ensure that consumer products didn\u2019t catch fire. It\nwanted to stop the routine adulteration of food and improve the\nsafety and efficacy of medications. And it wanted cleaner air and\nwater. If an American could go back in time, she might be\nastonished by how much progress has occurred in all those areas. It\ndidn\u2019t happen through legislation alone. It happened because\nCongress gave broad-ranging powers to administrative agencies, and\nthose agencies then filled in\u2014rule by rule by rule\u2014Congress\u2019s\npolicy outlines.This Court has historically known enough not to\nget in the way. Maybe the best explanation of why comes from\nJustice Scalia. SeeMistretta, 488 U.\u00a0S., at 415\u2013416\n(dissenting opinion). The context was somewhat different. He was\nresponding to an argument that Congress could not constitutionally\ndelegate broad policymaking authority; here, the Court reads a\ndelegation with unwarranted skepticism, and thereby artificially\nconstrains its scope. But Justice Scalia\u2019s reasoning remains on\npoint. He started with the inevitability of delegations: \u201c[S]ome\njudgments involving policy considerations,\u201d he stated, \u201cmust be\nleft to [administrative] officers.\u201dId., at 415. Then he\nexplained why courts should not try to seriously police those\ndelegations, barring\u2014or, I\u2019ll add, narrowing\u2014some on the ground\nthat they went too far. The scope of delegations, he said,\u201cmust be fixed according to common sense\nand the inherent necessities of the governmental co-ordination.\nSince Congress is no less endowed with common sense than we are,\nand better equipped to inform itself of the necessities of\ngovernment; and since the factors bearing upon those necessities\nare both multifarious and (in the nonpartisan sense) highly\npolitical .\u00a0.\u00a0. it is small wonder that we have almost\nnever felt qualified to second-guess Congress regarding the\npermissible degree of policy judgment that can be left to those\nexecuting or applying the law.\u201dId., at 416 (internal\nquotation marks omitted).In short, when it comes to delegations, there\nare good reasons for Congress (within extremely broad limits) to\nget to call the shots. Congress knows about how government works in\nways courts don\u2019t. More specifically, Congress knows what mix of\nlegislative and administrative action conduces to good policy.\nCourts should be modest.Today, the Court is not. Section 111, most\nnaturally read, authorizes EPA to develop the Clean Power Plan\u2014in\nother words, to decide that generation shifting is the \u201cbest system\nof emission reduction\u201d for power plants churning out carbon\ndioxide. Evaluating systems of emission reduction is what EPA does.\nAnd nothing in the rest of the Clean Air Act, or any other statute,\nsuggests that Congress did not mean for the delegation it wrote to\ngo as far as the text says. In rewriting that text, the Court\nsubstitutes its own ideas about delegations for Congress\u2019s. And\nthat means the Court substitutes its own ideas about policymaking\nfor Congress\u2019s. The Court will not allow the Clean Air Act to work\nas Congress instructed. The Court, rather than Congress, will\ndecide how much regulation is too much.The subject matter of the regulation here makes\nthe Court\u2019s intervention all the more troubling. Whatever else this\nCourt may know about, it does not have a clue about how to address\nclimate change. And let\u2019s say the obvious: The stakes here are\nhigh. Yet the Court today prevents congressionally authorized\nagency action to curb power plants\u2019 carbon dioxide emissions. The\nCourt appoints itself\u2014instead of Congress or the expert agency\u2014the\ndecision-maker on climate policy. I cannot think of many things\nmore frightening. Respectfully, I dissent.Notes1Those constraints have\nhad real effect: They have led EPA in prior rulemakings to exclude\na number of pollution-control measures from the \u201cbest system of\nemission reduction.\u201d See Brief for United States 49 (collecting\ncitations).2The majority offers a\ntheory for why Congress insisted on a technological system for new\nsources: It was, the majority says, to prevent EPA\u2019s use of a\nparticular kind of technological system (involving fuel switching)\nto achieve emissions reductions. Seeante, at 22, n.\u00a02,\n23. To begin with: I don\u2019t see how requiring EPA to select among\ntechnological systems precludes it from picking what the majority\nagrees is one such measure. Seeante, at 4, 22, n.\u00a02,\n22\u201323. But more important, I can\u2019t see why the majority\u2019s\nexplanation matters. Let\u2019s assume the majority is right about\nCongress\u2019s motive. The key point remains the same: Whatever that\nmotive, Congress\u2019s instruction to use technological systems applied\nonly to new sources, and not to existing ones. As to the latter,\nCongress allowed EPA more latitude: The Agency could use\ntechnologicalornon-technological methods, as it preferred.\nThat distinction is what creates interpretive difficulties for the\nmajority\u2014again, no matter why it arose.3Similarly, inKingv.Burwell, 576 U.S. 473 (2015), we relied onBrown &\nWilliamsonin declining to defer to the Internal Revenue\nService\u2019s construction of the Affordable Care Act. We thought it\nhighly \u201cunlikely that Congress would have delegated\u201d an important\ndecision about healthcare pricing to an agency with \u201cno expertise\nin crafting health insurance policy.\u201d 576 U.\u00a0S., at\n486.4Not every Justice, of\ncourse, agreed with the Court\u2019s conclusions in the above-discussed\ncases; to be frank, I dissented in a couple. But what matters here\nis the analysis those decisions undertook\u2014and how, as I\u2019ll\ndescribe, it supports EPA\u2019s Clean Power Plan.5The majority\u2019s only\nresponse to the argument above similarly reveals a misperception as\nto the practical impact of different regulatory techniques.\nAccording to the majority, there is an \u201cobvious difference\u201d between\nchanging the energy mix by conventional technological regulation\nand doing so by measures like cap and trade.Ante, at 27,\nn.\u00a04. But in fact there is not. As I\u2019ll detail later,\ngeneration shifting can effect a significant\u2014or instead an\ninsignificant\u2014change in the energy mix; and the same is true of\ntechnological regulations. Seeinfra, at 24\u201325. It all\ndepends on the specifics: There is no necessary connection (in\neither direction) between thekindof regulation and the\nmagnitude of its effect. For example, a rule requiring the use of\ncarbon-capture technology would have shifted far more electricity\nproduction from coal-fired plants than the Clean Power Plan would\nhave. Seeibid.In suggesting that cap-and-trade programs\nare somehow more suspect, the majority merely serves to\ndisadvantage what is often the smartest kind of regulation:\nmarket-based programs that achieve the biggest bang for the buck.\nThat is why so many power companies are on EPA\u2019s side in this\nlitigation.6Even when the Clean Power\nPlan was first issued, its projected impact was far less than what\nthe majority implies. The majority states, for example, that the\nrule would have \u201creduce[d] GDP by at least a trillion 2009 dollars\nby 2040.\u201dAnte, at 10. That sounds like a lot, but it is in\nfact \u201cequivalent to changes of a few tenths of 1 percent from\nbaseline.\u201d Dept. of Energy, Analysis of the Impacts of the Clean\nPower Plan 63\u201364 (2015). And the \u201cbillions of dollars in compliance\ncosts\u201d the majority highlights were vastly outweighed by the Plan\u2019s\nprojected benefits.Ante, at 10; see 80 Fed. Reg. 64679\n(anticipating $5\u2013$8 billion in costs and $32\u2013$54 billion in\nbenefits by 2030); see also EPA, Regulatory Impact Analysis for the\nClean Power Plan Final Rule 6\u201335 (2015) (estimating that by 2030\njobs gained from the Plan would be some two or three times greater\nthan jobs lost).7The majority dismisses\nthese hypotheticals as fantastical, protesting that \u201cEPA has never\nordered anything remotely like [them], and we doubt it could.\u201dAnte, at 24, n.\u00a03. But that\u2019s just the point. EPA\nhasn\u2019t forced the elimination of coal plants\u2014whether through\ntechnological controls or generation shifting\u2014becausethe\nstatutory constraints prevent it from doing so. The majority offers\nno reason to think that those constraints suffice for the measures\nit approves (fuel switching and carbon capture) but not for the\nmeasure it rejects (generation shifting). Either the constraints\nare enough or they are not. The majority cannot have it both\nways.8The majority opinion at\nleast addresses the statute\u2019s text, though overstating its\nambiguity and approaching the action taken under it with\nunwarranted \u201cskepticism.\u201dAnte, at 28; seeante, at\n28\u201331. The concurrence, by contrast, concludes that the Clean Air\nAct does not clearly enough authorize EPA\u2019s Plan without ever\nciting the statutory text. Seeante, at 13\u201316. Nowhere will\nyou find the concurrence ask: What does the phrase \u201cbest system of\nemission reduction\u201d mean? \u00a77411(a)(1). So much for \u201cbegin[ning], as\nwe must, with a careful examination of the statutory text.\u201dHensonv.Santander Consumer USA Inc., 582 U.S. 79,\n___ (2017) (slip op., at 3).",
