InStolt-Nielsen S.\u00a0A.v.AnimalFeeds Int\u2019l Corp.,559 U.S.\n662(2010), we held that a court may not compel arbitration on\na classwide basis when an agreement is \u201csilent\u201d on the availability\nof such arbitration. Because class arbitration fundamentally\nchanges the nature of the \u201ctraditional individualized arbitration\u201d\nenvisioned by the FAA,Epic Systems Corp.v.Lewis,\n584 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2018) (slip op., at 8), \u201ca party may not\nbe compelled under the FAA to submit to class arbitration unless\nthere is a contractual basis for concluding that the partyagreedto do so,\u201dStolt-Nielsen, 559 U.\u00a0S., at\n684 (emphasis in original). We now consider whether the FAA\nsimilarly bars an order requiring class arbitration when an\nagreement is not silent, but rather \u201cambiguous\u201d about the\navailability of such arbitration.IPetitioner Lamps Plus is a company that sells\nlight fixtures and related products. In 2016, a hacker\nimpersonating a company official tricked a Lamps Plus em- ployee\ninto disclosing the tax information of approximately 1,300 other\nemployees. Soon after, a fraudulent federal income tax return was\nfiled in the name of Frank Varela, a Lamps Plus employee and\nrespondent here.Like most Lamps Plus employees, Varela had\nsigned an arbitration agreement when he started work at the\ncompany. But after the data breach, he sued Lamps Plus in Federal\nDistrict Court in California, bringing state and federal claims on\nbehalf of a putative class of employees whose tax information had\nbeen compromised. Lamps Plus moved to compel arbitration on an\nindividual rather than classwide basis, and to dismiss the lawsuit.\nIn a single order, the District Court granted the motion to compel\narbitration and dismissed Varela\u2019s claims without prejudice. But\nthe court rejected Lamps Plus\u2019s request for individual arbitration,\ninstead authorizing arbitration on a classwide basis. Lamps Plus\nappealed the order, arguing that the court erred by compelling\nclass arbitration.The Ninth Circuit affirmed. 701 Fed. Appx. 670\n(2017). The court acknowledged thatStolt-Nielsenprohibits\nforcing a party \u201cto submit to class arbitration unless there is a\ncontractual basis for concluding that the partyagreedto do\nso\u201d and that Varela\u2019s agreement \u201cinclude[d] no express mention of\nclass proceedings.\u201d 701 Fed. Appx., at 672. But that did not end\nthe inquiry, the court reasoned, because the fact that the\nagreement \u201cdoes not expressly refer to class arbitration is not the\n\u2018silence\u2019 contemplated inStolt-Nielsen.\u201dIbid.InStolt-Nielsen, the parties hadstipulatedthat their\nagreement was silent about class arbitration. Because there was no\nsuch stipulation here, the court concluded thatStolt-Nielsenwas not controlling.The Ninth Circuit then determined that the\nagreement was ambiguous on the issue of class arbitration. On the\none hand, as Lamps Plus argued, certain phrases in the agreement\nseemed to contemplate \u201cpurely binary claims.\u201dIbid.At the\nsame time, as Varela asserted, other phrases were capacious enough\nto include class arbitration, such as one stating that \u201carbitration\nshall be in lieu of any and all lawsuits or other civil legal\nproceedings relating to my employment.\u201dIbid.The Ninth\nCircuit followed California law to construe the ambiguity against\nthe drafter, a rule that \u201capplies with peculiar force in the case\nof a contract of adhesion\u201d such as this.Ibid.(quotingSandquistv.Lebo Auto., Inc., 1 Cal. 5th 233, 248,\n376 P.3d 506, 514 (2016)). Because Lamps Plus had drafted the\nagreement, the court adopted Varela\u2019s interpretation authorizing\nclass arbitration. Judge Fernandez dissented. In his view, the\nagreement was not ambiguous, and the majority\u2019s holding was a\n\u201cpalpable evasion ofStolt-Nielsen.\u201d 701 Fed. Appx., at\n673.Lamps Plus petitioned for a writ of certiorari,\narguing that the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision contravenedStolt-Nielsenand created a conflict among the Courts of\nAppeals. In opposition, Varela not only disputed those contentions\nbut also argued for the first time that the Ninth Circuit lacked\njurisdiction over the appeal, and that this Court therefore lacked\njurisdiction in turn. We granted certiorari. 584 U.\u00a0S. ___\n(2018).IIWe begin with jurisdiction. Section 16 of the\nFAA governs appellate review of arbitration orders. 9\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a716. Varela contends that the Ninth Circuit\nlacked statutory jurisdiction because section 16 permits appeal\nfrom ordersdenyingmotions to compel arbitration,\n\u00a716(a)(1)(B), but not ordersgrantingsuch motions,\n\u00a716(b)(2). Brief for Respondent 9\u201312; see alsopost, at 3\n(Breyer, J., dissenting). This argument is beside the point,\nhowever, because Lamps Plus relies for jurisdiction on a different\nprovision of section 16, section 16(a)(3).Section 16(a)(3) provides that an appeal may be\ntaken from \u201ca final decision with respect to an arbitration that is\nsubject to this title.\u201d We construed that provision inGreen\nTree Financial Corp.-Ala.v.Randolph,531 U.S.\n79(2000), a case where, as here, the District Court had issued\nan order both compelling arbitration and dismissing the underlying\nclaims. We held that such an order directing \u201cthe parties to\nproceed to arbitration, and dismiss[ing] all the claims before [the\ncourt], .\u00a0.\u00a0. is \u2018final\u2019 within the meaning of \u00a716(a)(3),\nand therefore appealable.\u201dId., at 89.[1]Varela attempts to distinguishRandolphon the ground that the appeal here was taken by the party who\nsought an order to dismiss the claim and compel arbitration, Lamps\nPlus. He claims the company \u201clacked standing to appeal the\ndismissal,\u201d because the District Court\u2019s order \u201cprovided precisely\nthe relief Lamps Plus sought.\u201d Brief for Respondent 13, 15.But Lamps Plus did not secure the relief it\nrequested. It sought an order compellingindividualarbitration. What it got was an order rejecting that relief and\ninstead compelling arbitration on a classwide basis. We have\nexplained\u2014and will elaborate further below\u2014that shifting from\nindividual to class arbitration is a \u201cfundamental\u201d change,Stolt-Nielsen, 559 U.\u00a0S., at 686, that \u201csacrifices the\nprincipal advantage of arbitration\u201d and \u201cgreatly increases risks to\ndefendants,\u201dAT&T Mobility LLCv.Concepcion,563 U.S.\n333, 348, 350 (2011). Lamps Plus\u2019s interest in avoiding those\nconsequences gives it the \u201cnecessary personal stake in the appeal\u201d\nrequired by our precedent.Camretav.Greene,563 U.S.\n692, 702 (2011).[2]IIIThe Ninth Circuit applied California contract\nlaw to conclude that the parties\u2019 agreement was ambiguous on the\navailability of class arbitration. In California, an agreement is\nambiguous \u201cwhen it is capable of two or more constructions, both of\nwhich are reasonable.\u201d 701 Fed. Appx., at 672 (quotingPowerine\nOil Co.v.Superior Ct., 37 Cal. 4th 377, 390, 118 P.3d\n589, 598 (2005)). Following our normal practice, we defer to the\nNinth Circuit\u2019s interpretation and application of state law and\nthus accept that the agreement should be regarded as ambiguous.\nSee,e.g.,Expressions Hair Designv.Schneiderman, 581 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at\n7).[3]We therefore face the question whether,\nconsistent with the FAA, an ambiguous agreement can provide the\nnecessary \u201ccontractual basis\u201d for compelling class arbitration.Stolt-Nielsen, 559 U.\u00a0S., at 684. We hold that it\ncannot\u2014a conclusion that follows directly from our decision inStolt-Nielsen. Class arbitration is not only markedly\ndifferent from the \u201ctraditional individualized arbitration\u201d\ncontemplated by the FAA, it also undermines the most important\nbenefits of that familiar form of arbitration.Epic Systems,\n584 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 8); seeStolt-Nielsen,\n559 U.\u00a0S., at 686\u2013687. The statute therefore requires more\nthan ambiguity to ensure that the parties actually agreed to\narbitrate on a classwide basis.AThe FAA requires courts to \u201cenforce\narbitration agreements according to their terms.\u201dEpic\nSystems, 584 U.\u00a0S.,at ___ (slip op., at 5)\n(quotingAmerican Express Co.v.Italian Colors\nRestaurant, 570 U.S. 228, 233 (2013)). Although courts may\nordinarily accomplish that end by relying on state contract\nprinciples,First Options of Chicago, Inc.v.Kaplan,514 U.S.\n938, 944 (1995), state law is preempted to the extent it\n\u201cstands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the\nfull purposes and objectives\u201d of the FAA,Concepcion, 563\nU.\u00a0S., at 352 (internal quotation marks omitted). At issue in\nthis case is the interaction between a state contract principle for\naddressing ambiguity and a \u201crule[\u00a0] of fundamental importance\u201d\nunder the FAA, namely, that arbitration \u201cis a matter of consent,\nnot coercion.\u201dStolt-Nielsen, 559 U.\u00a0S., at 681\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\u201c[T]he first principle that underscores all of\nour arbitration decisions\u201d is that \u201c[a]rbitration is strictly a\nmatter of consent.\u201dGranite Rock Co.v.Teamsters,561 U.S.\n287, 299 (2010) (internal quotation marks omitted). We have\nemphasized that \u201cfoundational FAA principle\u201d many times.Stolt-Nielsen, 559 U.\u00a0S., at 684; see also,e.g.,Howsamv.Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc.,537 U.S.\n79, 83 (2002);First Options, 514 U.\u00a0S., at 943;Mastrobuonov.Shearson Lehman Hutton, Inc.,514 U.S.\n52, 57 (1995);Volt Information Sciences, Inc.v.Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior Univ.,489 U.S.\n468, 479 (1989);Mitsubishi Motors Corp.v.Soler\nChrysler-Plymouth, Inc.,473 U.S.\n614, 626 (1985).Consent is essential under the FAA because\narbitrators wield only the authority they are given. That is, they\nderive their \u201cpowers from the parties\u2019 agreement to forgo the legal\nprocess and submit their disputes to private dispute resolution.\u201dStolt-Nielsen, 559 U.\u00a0S., at 682. Parties may generally\nshape such agreements to their liking by specifying with whom they\nwill arbitrate, the issues subject to arbitration, the rules by\nwhich they will arbitrate, and the arbitrators who will resolve\ntheir disputes.Id., at 683\u2013684. Whatever they settle on,\nthe task for courts and arbitrators at bottom remains the same: \u201cto\ngive effect to the intent of the parties.\u201dId., at 684.In carrying out that responsibility, it is\nimportant to recognize the \u201cfundamental\u201d difference between class\narbitration and the individualized form of arbitration envisioned\nby the FAA.Epic Systems, 584 U.\u00a0S.,at ___\n(slip op., at 8); see alsoConcepcion, 563 U.\u00a0S., at\n349, 351;Stolt-Nielsen, 559 U.\u00a0S., at 686\u2013687. In\nindividual arbitration, \u201cparties forgo the procedural rigor and\nappellate review of the courts in order to realize the benefits of\nprivate dispute resolution: lower costs, greater efficiency and\nspeed, and the ability to choose expert adjudicators to resolve\nspecialized disputes.\u201dId., at 685. Class arbitration lacks\nthose benefits. It \u201csacrifices the principal advantage of\narbitration\u2014its informality\u2014and makes the process slower, more\ncostly, and more likely to generate procedural morass than final\njudgment.\u201dConcepcion, 563 U.\u00a0S., at 348. Indeed, we\nrecognized just last Term that with class arbitration \u201cthe virtues\nCongress originally saw in arbitration, its speed and simplicity\nand inexpensiveness, would be shorn away and arbitration would wind\nup looking like the litigation it was meant to displace.\u201dEpic\nSystems, 584 U.\u00a0S.,at ___ (slip op., at 8). Class\narbitration not only \u201cintroduce[s] new risks and costs for both\nsides,\u201dibid., it also raises serious due process concerns\nby adjudicating the rights of absent members of the plaintiff\nclass\u2014again, with only limited judicial review. SeeConcepcion, 563 U.\u00a0S., 349; see alsoStolt-Nielsen, 559 U.\u00a0S., at 686 (citingOrtizv.Fibreboard Corp.,527 U.S.\n815, 846 (1999)).Because of these \u201ccrucial differences\u201d between\nindivid- ual and class arbitration,Stolt-Nielsenexplained\nthat there is \u201creason to doubt the parties\u2019 mutual consent to\nresolve disputes through classwide arbitration.\u201d 559 U.\u00a0S., at\n687, 685\u2013686. And for that reason, we held that courts may not\ninfer consent to participate in class arbitration absent an\naffirmative \u201ccontractual basis for concluding that the partyagreedto do so.\u201dId., at 684. Silence is not enough;\nthe \u201cFAA requires more.\u201dId., at 687.Our reasoning inStolt-Nielsencontrols\nthe question we face today. Like silence, ambiguity does not\nprovide a sufficient basis to conclude that parties to an\narbitration agreement agreed to \u201csacrifice[\u00a0] the principal\nadvantage of arbitration.\u201dConcepcion, 563 U.\u00a0S., at\n348.This conclusion aligns with our refusal to infer\nconsent when it comes to other fundamental arbitration questions.\nFor example, we presume that parties havenotauthorized\narbitrators to resolve certain \u201cgateway\u201d questions, such as\n\u201cwhether the parties have a valid arbitration agreement at all or\nwhether a concededly binding arbitration clause applies to a\ncertain type of controversy.\u201dGreen Tree Financial Corp.v.Bazzle,539 U.S.\n444, 452 (2003) (plural- ity opinion). Although parties are\nfree to authorize arbitrators to resolve such questions, we will\nnot conclude that they have done so based on \u201csilenceorambiguity\u201d in their agreement, because \u201cdoing so might too often\nforce unwilling parties to arbitrate a matter they reasonably would\nhave thought a judge, not an arbitrator, would decide.\u201dFirst\nOptions, 514 U.\u00a0S., at 945 (emphasis added); see alsoHowsam, 537 U.\u00a0S., at 83\u201384. We relied on that same\nreasoning inStolt-Nielsen, 559 U.\u00a0S., at 686\u2013687, and\nit applies with equal force here. Neither silence nor ambiguity\nprovides a sufficient basis for concluding that parties to an\narbitration agreement agreed to undermine the central benefits of\narbitration itself.[4]BThe Ninth Circuit reached a contrary\nconclusion based on California\u2019s rule that ambiguity in a contract\nshould be construed against the drafter, a doctrine known ascontra proferentem. The rule applies \u201conly as a last resort\u201d\nwhen the meaning of a provision remains ambiguous after exhausting\nthe ordinary methods of interpretation. 3 A. Corbin, Contracts\n\u00a7559, pp. 268\u2013270 (1960). At that point,contra proferentemresolves the ambiguity against the drafter based on public policy\nfactors, primarily equitable considerations about the parties\u2019\nrelative bargaining strength. See 2 E. Farnsworth, Contracts \u00a77.11,\npp. 300\u2013304 (3d ed. 2004); see also 11 R. Lord, Williston on\nContracts \u00a732:12, pp. 788\u2013792 (4th ed. 2012) (stating that\napplication of the rule may vary based on \u201cthe degree of\nsophistication of the contracting parties or the degree to which\nthe contract was negotiated\u201d); Restatement (Second) of Contracts\n\u00a7206, pp. 80\u201381, 105\u2013107 (1979) (classifyingcontra\nproferentemunder \u201cConsiderations of Fairness and the Public\nInterest\u201d rather than with rules for interpreting \u201cThe Meaning of\nAgreements\u201d); 3 Corbin, Contracts \u00a7559, at 270 (noting thatcontra proferentemis \u201cchiefly a rule of public policy\u201d).\nAlthough the rule enjoys a place in every hornbook and treatise on\ncontracts, we noted in a recent FAA case that \u201cthe reach of the\ncanon construing contract language against the drafter must have\nlimits, no matter who the drafter was.\u201dDIRECTV, Inc.v.Imburgia, 577 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2015) (slip op., at 10).\nThis case brings those limits into focus.Unlike contract rules that help to interpret the\nmeaning of a term, and thereby uncover the intent of the parties,contra proferentemis by definition triggered only after a\ncourt determines that itcannotdiscern the intent of the\nparties. When a contract is ambiguous,contra proferentemprovides a default rule based on public policy considerations; \u201cit\ncan scarcely be said to be designed to ascertain the meanings\nattached by the parties.\u201d 2 Farnsworth, Contracts \u00a77.11, at 303.\nLike the contract rule preferring interpretations that favor the\npublic interest, seeid.,at 304,contra proferentemseeks ends other than the intent of the parties.\u201c[C]lass arbitration, to the extent it is\nmanufactured by [state law] rather than consen[t], is inconsistent\nwith the FAA.\u201dConcepcion, 563 U.\u00a0S., at 348. We\nrecently reiterated that courts may not rely on state contract\nprinciples to \u201creshape traditional individualized arbitration by\nmandating classwide arbitration procedures without the parties\u2019\nconsent.\u201dEpic Systems, 584 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at\n8). But that is precisely what the court below did, requiring class\narbitration on the basis of a doctrine that \u201cdoes not help to\ndetermine the meaning that the two parties gave to the words, or\neven the meaning that a reasonable person would have given to the\nlanguage used.\u201d 3 Corbin, Contracts \u00a7559, at 269\u2013270. Such an\napproach is flatly inconsistent with \u201cthe foundational FAA\nprinciple that arbitration is a matter of consent.\u201dStolt-Nielsen, 559 U.\u00a0S., at 684.Varela and Justice Kagan defend application of\nthe rule on the basis that it is nondiscriminatory. It does not\nconflict with the FAA, they argue, because it is a neutral rule\nthat gives equal treatment to arbitration agreements and other\ncontracts alike. See Brief for Respondent 18, 25\u201326;post,\nat 6\u20139 (Kagan, J., dissenting). We have explained, however, that\nsuch an equal treatment principle cannot save from preemption\ngeneral rules \u201cthat target arbitration either by name or by more\nsubtle methods, such as by \u2018interfer[ing] with fundamental\nattributes of arbitration.\u2019\u00a0\u201dEpic Systems, 584\nU.\u00a0S.,at ___ (slip op., at 7) (quotingConcepcion, 563 U.\u00a0S., at 344).That was the case inConcepcion. There,\nthe Court considered the general contract defense of\nunconscionability, which had been interpreted by the state court to\nbar class action waivers in consumer contracts, whether in the\nlitigation or arbitration context. Seeid., at 341\u2013344. The\ngeneral applicability of the rule did not save it from preemption\nunder the FAA with respect to arbitration agreements, because it\nhad the consequence of allowing any party to a consumer arbitration\nagreement to demand class proceedings \u201cwithout the parties\u2019\nconsent.\u201dEpic Systems, 584 U.\u00a0S.,at ___ (slip\nop., at 8) (describing the \u201cessential insight\u201d ofConcepcion). That, for the reasons we have explained,\n\u201cinterferes with fundamental attributes of arbitration and thus\ncreates a scheme inconsistent with the FAA.\u201dConcepcion, 563\nU.\u00a0S., at 344; seeEpic Systems, 584 U.\u00a0S.,at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 8\u20139). The same reasoning applies here: The\ngeneralcontra proferentemrule cannot be applied to impose\nclass arbitration in the absence of the parties\u2019 consent.[5]Our opinion today is far from the watershed\nJustice Kagan claims it to be. Rather, it is consistent with a long\nline of cases holding that the FAA provides the default rule for\nresolving certain ambiguities in arbitration agreements. For\nexample, we have repeatedly held that ambiguities about the scope\nof an arbitration agreement must be resolved in favor of\narbitration. See,e.g.,Mitsubishi Motors Corp., 473\nU.\u00a0S., at 626;Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospitalv.Mercury Constr. Corp.,460 U.S.\n1, 24\u201325 (1983). In those cases, we did not seek to resolve the\nambiguity by asking who drafted the agreement. Instead, we held\nthat the FAA itself provided the rule. As in those cases, the FAA\nprovides the default rule for resolving ambiguity here.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*Courts may not infer from an ambiguous agreement\nthat parties have consented to arbitrate on a classwide basis. The\ndoctrine ofcontra proferentemcannot substitute for the\nrequisite affirmative \u201ccontractual basis for concluding that the\npart[ies]agreedto [class arbitration].\u201dStolt-Nielsen, 559 U.\u00a0S., at 684.We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals\nfor the Ninth Circuit and remand the case for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.Notes1Justice Breyer repeatedly\nrefers to the order in this case as \u201cinterlocutory,\u201dpost,\nat 5\u20137 (dissenting opinion), but\u2014as the language quoted above makes\nclear\u2014Randolphexpressly held that such an order is \u201cfinal\u201d\nunder the FAA. Justice Breyer also claims thatRandolph\u201cexplicitly reserved the [jurisdictional] question that we face\nnow,\u201dpost, at 7, butRandolphreserved a different\nquestion. In that case, the District Court had denied a motion to\nstay. We noted that, if the District Court had entered a stay\ninstead of dismissing the case, an appeal would have been barred by\n9 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a716(b)(1). That said, we expressly refrained\nfrom addressing whether the District Courtshouldhavegranted the stay. See 531 U.\u00a0S., at 87, n.\u00a02.\nThat is the question we reserved. Justice Breyer would have us take\nup that question today,post, at 3, 7, but there is no basis\nfor doing so. The FAA provides that a district court \u201cshallon\napplication of one of the partiesstay\u201d the case pending the\narbitration. 9 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73 (emphasis added). Here, no\nparty sought a stay. Thus, Justice Breyer\u2019s jurisdictional analysis\nis premised on two events that did not happen\u2014a District Court\nruling that was never issued denying a stay request that was never\nmade. In short, Justice Breyer has written an opinion for a case\nother than the one before us.2And contrary to Varela\u2019s\ncontention, Brief for Respondent 14\u201315, and Justice Breyer\u2019s\ndissent,post, at 6\u20137, this is hardly a case likeMicrosoft Corp. v.Baker, 582 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2017).\nThere, we held that plaintiffs cannot generate a final appealable\norder byvoluntarilydismissing their claim. Here, Lamps\nPlus was the defendant, and the District Court compelled class\narbitration over the company\u2019s vigorous opposition.3Justice Kagan offers her\nown interpretation of the contract, concludes that it unambiguously\nauthorizes class arbitration,post, at 2\u20134, and criticizes\nus for \u201cdisregard[ing] the actual contract the parties signed,\u201dpost, at 14. Justice Sotomayor, on the other hand, concludes\nthat the contract is ambiguous about class arbitration but\ncriticizes us for treating the contract as .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nambiguous.Post,at 2\u20133 (dissenting opinion). Again, we\nsimply follow this Court\u2019s ordinary approach, which \u201caccord[s]\ngreat deference\u201d to the courts of appeals in their interpretation\nof state law.Expressions Hair Design, 581 U.\u00a0S., at\n___, (slip op., at 7) (quotingPembaurv.Cincinnati,475 U.S.\n469, 484 n.\u00a013 (1986) (collecting cases)).4This Court has not\ndecided whether the availability of class arbitration is a\nso-called \u201cquestion of arbitrability,\u201d which includes these gateway\nmatters.Oxford Health Plans LLCv.Sutter,569 U.S.\n564, 569, n.\u00a02 (2013). We have no occasion to address that\nquestion here because the parties agreed that a court, not an\narbitrator, should resolve the question about class\narbitration.5Varela and Justice Kagan\ncontend that our use ofcontra proferenteminMastrobuonov.Shearson Lehman Hutton, Inc.,514 U.S.\n52, 57 (1995), establishes that the rule is not preempted by\nthe FAA.

InMastrobuono, however, we had no occasion to\nconsider a conflict between the FAA andcontra proferentembecause both rules led to the same result. Our holding was\nprimarily based on the FAA policy favoring arbitration, 514\nU.\u00a0S., at 62, and only after establishing that did we applycontra proferentem, noting that the rule was \u201cwell suited to\nthe facts of this case,\u201did., at 63.
