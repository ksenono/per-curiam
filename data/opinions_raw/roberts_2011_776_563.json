S. ____ (2011)SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESNO. 09-1159BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF THE LELAND STANFORD JUNIOR\nUNIVERSITY, PETITIONERv.ROCHE MOLECULAR SYSTEMS, INC.,\net\u00a0al.on writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the federal circuit[June 6, 2011]Chief Justice Roberts delivered\nthe opinion of the Court.Since 1790, the patent law has\noperated on the premise that rights in an invention belong to the\ninventor. The question here is whether the University and Small\nBusiness Patent Procedures Act of 1980\u2014commonly referred to as the\nBayh-Dole Act\u2014displaces that norm and automatically vests title to\nfederally funded inventions in federal contractors. We hold that it\ndoes not.IAIn 1985, a small California\nresearch company called Cetus began to develop methods for\nquantifying blood-borne levels of human immunodeficiency virus\n(HIV), the virus that causes AIDS. A Nobel Prize winning technique\ndeveloped at Cetus\u2014polymerase chain reaction, or PCR\u2014was an\nintegral part of these efforts. PCR allows billions of copies of\nDNA sequences to be made from a small initial blood sample.In 1988, Cetus began to\ncollaborate with scientists at Stanford University\u2019s Department of\nInfectious Diseases to test the efficacy of new AIDS drugs. Dr.\nMark Holodniy joined Stanford as a research fellow in the\ndepartment around that time. When he did so, he signed a Copyright\nand Patent Agreement (CPA) stating that he \u201cagree[d] to assign\u201d to\nStanford his \u201cright, title and interest in\u201d inventions resulting\nfrom his employment at the University. App. to Pet. for Cert.\n118a\u2013119a.At Stanford Holodniy undertook to develop an\nimproved method for quantifying HIV levels in patient blood\nsamples, using PCR. Because Holodniy was largely unfamiliar with\nPCR, his supervisor arranged for him to conduct research at Cetus.\nAs a condition of gaining access to Cetus, Holodniy signed a\nVisitor\u2019s Confidentiality Agreement (VCA). That agreement stated\nthat Holodniy \u201cwill assign and do[es] hereby assign\u201d to Cetus his\n\u201cright, title and interest in each of the ideas, inventions and\nimprovements\u201d made \u201cas a consequence of [his] access\u201d to Cetus.Id.,at 122a\u2013124a.For the next nine months, Holodniy conducted\nresearch at Cetus. Working with Cetus employees, Holodniy devised a\nPCR-based procedure for calculating the amount of HIV in a\npatient\u2019s blood. That technique allowed doctors to determine\nwhether a patient was benefiting from HIV therapy.Holodniy then returned to Stanford where he\nand other University employees tested the HIV measurement\ntechnique. Over the next few years, Stanford obtained written\nassignments of rights from the Stanford employees involved in\nrefinement of the technique, including Holodniy, and filed several\npatent applications related to the procedure. Stanford secured\nthree patents to the HIV measurement process.In 1991, Roche Molecular Systems, a company\nthat specializes in diagnostic blood screening, acquired Cetus\u2019s\nPCR-related assets, including all rights Cetus had obtained through\nagreements like the VCA signed by Holodniy. After conducting\nclinical trials on the HIV quantification method developed at\nCetus, Roche commercialized the procedure. Today, Roche\u2019s HIV test\n\u201ckits are used in hospitals and AIDS clinics worldwide.\u201d Brief for\nRespondents 10\u201311.BIn 1980, Congress passed the\nBayh-Dole Act to \u201cpromote the utilization of inventions arising\nfrom federally supported research,\u201d \u201cpromote collaboration between\ncommercial concerns and nonprofit organizations,\u201d and \u201censure that\nthe Government obtains sufficient rights in federally supported\ninventions.\u201d 35 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7200. To achieve these aims, the Act\nallocates rights in federally funded \u201csubject invention[s]\u201d between\nthe Federal Government and federal contractors (\u201cany person, small\nbusiness firm, or nonprofit organization that is a party to a\nfunding agreement\u201d). \u00a7\u00a7201(e), (c), 202(a). The Act defines\n\u201csubject invention\u201d as \u201cany invention of the contractor conceived\nor first actually reduced to practice in the performance of work\nunder a funding agreement.\u201d \u00a7201(e).The Bayh-Dole Act provides that\ncontractors may \u201celect to retain title to any subject invention.\u201d\n\u00a7202(a). To be able to retain title, a contractor must fulfill a\nnumber of obligations imposed by the statute. The contractor must\n\u201cdisclose each subject invention to the [relevant] Federal agency\nwithin a reasonable time\u201d; it must \u201cmake a written election within\ntwo years after disclosure\u201d stating that the contractor opts to\nretain title to the invention; and the contractor must \u201cfile a\npatent application prior to any statutory bar date.\u201d\n\u00a7\u00a7202(c)(1)\u2013(3). The \u201cFederal Government may receive title\u201d to a\nsubject invention if a contractor fails to comply with any of these\nobligations.Ibid.The Government has several rights in federally\nfunded subject inventions under the Bayh-Dole Act. The agency that\ngranted the federal funds receives from the contractor \u201ca\nnonexclusive, nontransferrable, irrevocable, paid-up license to\npractice . . . [the] subject invention.\u201d \u00a7202(c)(4). The agency\nalso possesses \u201c[m]arch-in rights,\u201d which permit the agency to\ngrant a license to a responsible third party under certain\ncircumstances, such as when the con-tractor fails to take\n\u201ceffective steps to achieve practical application\u201d of the\ninvention. \u00a7203. The Act further provides that when the contractor\ndoes not elect to retain title to a subject invention, the\nGovernment \u201cmay consider and after consultation with the contractor\ngrant requests for retention of rights by the inventor.\u201d\n\u00a7202(d).Some of Stanford\u2019s research related to the HIV\nmeasurement technique was funded by the National Institutes of\nHealth (NIH), thereby subjecting the invention to the Bayh-Dole\nAct. Accordingly, Stanford disclosed the in-vention, conferred on\nthe Government a nonexclusive, nontransferable, paid-up license to\nuse the patented proce-dure, and formally notified NIH that it\nelected to retain title to the invention.CIn 2005, the Board of Trustees of\nStanford University filed suit against Roche Molecular Systems,\nInc., Roche Diagnostics Corporation, and Roche Diagnostics\nOperations, Inc. (collectively Roche), contending that Roche\u2019s HIV\ntest kits infringed Stanford\u2019s patents. As relevant here, Roche\nresponded by asserting that it was a co-owner of the HIV\nquantification procedure, based on Holodniy\u2019s assignment of his\nrights in the Visitor\u2019s Confidentiality Agreement. As a result,\nRoche argued, Stanford lacked standing to sue it for patent\ninfringement. 487 F. Supp. 2d 1099, 1111, 1115 (ND Cal. 2007).\nStanford claimed that Holodniy had no rights to assign because the\nUniversity\u2019s HIV research was federally funded, giving the school\nsuperior rights in the invention under the Bayh-Dole Act.Ibid.[Footnote 1]The District Court held that\nthe \u201cVCA effectively assigned any rights that Holodniy had in the\npatented invention to Cetus,\u201d and thus to Roche. Id.,at 1117.\nBut because of the operation of the Bayh-Dole Act, \u201cHolodniy had no\ninterest to assign.\u201dId., at 1117, 1119. The court\nconcluded that the Bayh-Dole Act \u201cprovides that the individual\ninventor may obtain title\u201d to a federally funded invention \u201conly\nafter the government and the contracting party have declined to do\nso.\u201dId., at 1118.The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit\ndisagreed. First, the court concluded that Holodniy\u2019s initial\nagreement with Stanford in the Copyright and Patent Agreement\nconstituted a mere promise to assign rights in the future, unlike\nHolodniy\u2019s agreement with Cetus in the Visitor\u2019s Confidentiality\nAgreement, which itself assigned Holodniy\u2019s rights in the invention\nto Cetus. See 583 F. 3d 832, 841\u2013842 (2009). Therefore, as a matter\nof contract law, Cetus obtained Holodniy\u2019s rights in the HIV\nquantification technique through the VCA.[Footnote 2] Next, the court explained that the\nBayh-Dole Act \u201cdoes not automatically void ab initio the inventors\u2019\nrights in government-funded inventions\u201d and that the \u201cstatutory\nscheme did not automatically void the patent rights that Cetus\nreceived from Holodniy.\u201dId., at 844\u2013845. The court held\nthat \u201cRoche possesse[d] an ownership interest in the\npatents-in-suit\u201d that was not extinguished by the Bayh-Dole Act,\n\u201cdepriv[ing] Stanford of standing.\u201dId., at 836\u2013837. The\nCourt of Appeals then remanded the case with instructions to\ndismiss Stanford\u2019s infringement claim.Id.,at 849.We granted certiorari. 562 U. S. ___\n(2010).IIACongress has the authority \u201c[t]o\npromote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing \u2026 to\nAuthors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective\nWritings and Discoveries.\u201d U. S. Const. Art. I, \u00a78, cl.\u00a08. The\nfirst Congress put that power to use by enacting the Patent Act of\n1790. That Act provided \u201c[t]hat upon the petition of any person or\npersons \u2026 setting forth, that he, she, or they, hath or have\ninvented or discovered\u201d an invention, a patent could be granted to\n\u201csuch petitioner or petitioners\u201d or \u201ctheir heirs, administrators or\nassigns.\u201d Act of Apr. 10, 1790, \u00a71, 1 Stat. 109\u2013110. Under that\nlaw, the first patent was granted in 1790 to Samuel Hopkins, who\nhad devised an improved method for making potash, America\u2019s first\nindustrial chemical. U. S. Patent No. 1 (issued July 31,\n1790).[Footnote 3]Although much in intellectual\nproperty law has changed in the 220 years since the first Patent\nAct, the basic idea that inventors have the right to patent their\ninventions has not. Under the law in its current form, \u201c[w]hoever\ninvents or discovers any new and useful process, machine,\nmanufacture, or composition of matter \u2026 may obtain a patent\ntherefor.\u201d 35 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7101. The inventor must attest that \u201che\nbelieves himself to be the original and first inventor of the\n[invention] for which he solicits a patent.\u201d \u00a7115. In most cases, a\npatent may be issued only to an applying inventor, or\u2014because an\ninventor\u2019s interest in his invention is \u201cassignable in law by an\ninstrument in writing\u201d\u2014an inventor\u2019s assignee. \u00a7\u00a7151, 152, 261.Our precedents confirm the general rule that\nrights in an invention belong to the inventor. See,e.g.,Gaylerv.Wilder, 10 How. 477, 493 (1851) (\u201cthe\ndiscoverer of a new and useful improvement is vested by law with an\ninchoate right to its exclusive use, which he may perfect and make\nabsolute by proceeding in the manner which the law requires\u201d);Solomonsv.United States,137 U. S. 342, 346\n(1890) (\u201cwhatever invention [an inventor] may thus conceive and\nperfect is his individual property\u201d);United Statesv.Dubilier Condenser Corp.,289 U. S. 178, 188\n(1933) (an inventor owns \u201cthe product of [his] original thought\u201d).\nThe treatises are to the same effect. See,e.g.,8 Chisum\non Patents \u00a722.01, p. 22\u20132 (2011) (\u201cThe presumptive owner of the\nproperty right in a patentable invention is the single human\ninventor\u201d).It is equally well established that an\ninventor can assign his rights in an invention to a third party.\nSeeDubilier Condenser Corp.,supra,at 187 (\u201cA\npatent is property and title to it can pass only by assignment\u201d); 8\nChisum on Patents,supra, \u00a722.01, at 22\u20132 (\u201cThe inventor \u2026\n[may] transfer ownership interests by written assignment to\nanyone\u201d). Thus, although others may acquire an interest in an\ninvention, any such interest\u2014as a general rule\u2014must trace back to\nthe inventor.In accordance with these principles, we have\nrecognized that unless there is an agreement to the contrary, an\nemployer does not have rights in an invention \u201cwhich is the\noriginal conception of the employee alone.\u201dDubilier Condenser\nCorp., 289 U. S., at 189. Such an invention \u201cremains the\nproperty of him who conceived it.\u201dIbid. In most\ncircumstances, an inventor must expressly grant his rights in an\ninvention to his employer if the employer is to obtain those\nrights. Seeid., at 187 (\u201cThe respective rights and\nobligations of employer and employee, touching an invention\nconceived by the latter, spring from the contract of\nemployment\u201d).BStanford and the United States asamicus curiaecontend that the Bayh-Dole Act reorders the\nnormal priority of rights in an invention when the invention is\nconceived or first reduced to practice with the support of federal\nfunds. In their view, the Act moves inventors from the front of the\nline to the back by vesting title to federally funded inventions in\nthe inventor\u2019s employer\u2014the federal contractor. See Brief for\nPetitioner 26\u201327; Brief for United States asAmicus Curiae6.Congress has in the past divested inventors of\ntheir rights in inventions by providing unambiguously that\ninventions created pursuant to specified federal contracts become\nthe property of the United States. For example, with respect to\ncertain contracts dealing with nuclear material and atomic energy,\nCongress provided that title to such inventions \u201cshall be vested\nin, and be the property of, the [Atomic Energy] Commission.\u201d 42 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a72182. Congress has also enacted laws requiring that\ntitle to certain inventions made pursuant to contracts with the\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration \u201cshall be the\nexclusive property of the United States,\u201d Pub. L. 111\u2013314, \u00a73, 124\nStat. 3339, 51 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a720135(b)(1), and that title to\ncertain inventions under contracts with the Department of Energy\n\u201cshall vest in the United States.\u201d 42 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a75908.Such language is notably absent from the\nBayh-Dole Act. Nowhere in the Act is title expressly vested in\ncontractors or anyone else; nowhere in the Act are inventors\nexpressly deprived of their interest in federally funded\ninventions. Instead, the Act provides that contractors may \u201celect\nto retain title to any subject invention.\u201d 35 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7202(a). A \u201csubject invention\u201d is defined as \u201cany invention of the\ncontractor conceived or first actually reduced to practice in the\nperformance of work under a funding agreement.\u201d \u00a7201(e).Stanford asserts that the phrase \u201cinvention of\nthe contractor\u201d in this provision \u201cis naturally read to include all\ninventions made by the contractor\u2019s employees with the aid of\nfederal funding.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 32 (footnote omitted). That\nreading assumes that Congress subtly set aside two centuries of\npatent law in a statutory definition. It also renders the phrase\n\u201cof the contractor\u201d superfluous. If the phrase \u201cof the contractor\u201d\nwere deleted from the definition of \u201csubject invention,\u201d the\ndefinition would cover \u201cany invention \u2026 conceived or first actually\nreduced to practice in the performance of work under a funding\nagreement.\u201d Reading \u201cof the contractor\u201d to mean \u201call inventions\nmade by the contractor\u2019s employees with the aid of federal\nfunding,\u201d as Stanford would, adds nothing that is not already in\nthe definition, since the definition already covers inventions made\nunder the funding agreement. That is contrary to our general\n\u201creluctan[ce] to treat statutory terms as surplusage.\u201dDuncanv.Walker,533 U. S. 167, 174\n(2001) (internal quotation marks omitted).Construing the phrase to refer instead to a\nparticular category of inventions conceived or reduced to practice\nunder a funding agreement\u2014inventions \u201cof the contractor,\u201d that is,\nthose owned by or belonging to the con- tractor\u2014makes the phrase\nmeaningful in the statutory definition. And \u201cinvention owned by the\ncontractor\u201d or \u201cinvention belonging to the contractor\u201d are natural\nreadings of the phrase \u201cinvention of the contractor.\u201d As we have\nexplained, \u201c[t]he use of the word \u2018of\u2019 denotes ownership.\u201dPoev.Seaborn,282 U. S. 101, 109\n(1930); seeFlores- Figueroav.United States,\n556 U. S. ___, ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 2, 11) (treating the\nphrase \u201cidentification [papers] of another person\u201d as meaning such\nitems belonging to another person (internal quotation marks\nomitted));Ellisv.United States,206 U. S. 246, 259\n(1907) (interpreting the phrase \u201cworks of the United States\u201d to\nmean \u201cworks belonging to the United States\u201d (internal quotation\nmarks omitted)).That reading follows from a common definition\nof the word \u201cof.\u201d See Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary\n1565 (2002) (\u201cof\u201d can be \u201cused as a function word indicating a\npossessive relationship\u201d); New Oxford American Dictionary 1180 (2d\ned. 2005) (defining \u201cof\u201d as \u201cindicating an association between two\nentities, typically one of belonging\u201d); Webster\u2019s New Twentieth\nCentury Dictionary 1241 (2d ed. 1979) (defining \u201cof\u201d as \u201cbelonging\nto\u201d).Stanford\u2019s reading of the phrase \u201cinvention of\nthe contractor\u201d to mean \u201call inventions made by the contractor\u2019s\nemployees\u201d is plausible enough in the abstract; it is often the\ncase that whatever an employee produces in the course of his\nemployment belongs to his employer. No one would claim that an\nautoworker who builds a car while working in a factory owns that\ncar. But, as noted, patent law has always been different: We have\nrejected the idea that mere employment is sufficient to vest title\nto an employee\u2019s invention in the employer. Against this\nbackground, a contractor\u2019s invention\u2014an \u201cinvention of the\ncontractor\u201d\u2014does not automatically include inventions made by the\ncontractor\u2019s employees.[Footnote\n4]The Bayh-Dole Act\u2019s provision stating that\ncontractors may \u201celect toretaintitle\u201d confirms that the\nAct does notvesttitle. 35 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7202(a)\n(emphasis added). Stanford reaches the opposite conclusion, but\nonly because it reads \u201cretain\u201d to mean \u201cacquire\u201d and \u201creceive.\u201d\nBrief for Petitioner 36 (internal quotation marks omitted). That is\ncertainly not the common meaning of \u201cretain.\u201d \u201c[R]etain\u201d means \u201cto\nhold or continue to hold in possession or use.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third,supra, at 1938; see Webster\u2019s New Collegiate Dictionary\n980 (1980) (\u201cto keep in possession or use\u201d); American Heritage\nDictionary 1109 (1969) (\u201c[t]o keep or hold in one\u2019s possession\u201d).\nYou cannot retain something unless you already have it. SeeAlaskav.United States,545 U. S. 75, 104 (2005)\n(interpreting the phrase \u201cthe United States shall retain title to\nall property\u201d to mean that \u201c[t]he United States \u2026 retained title toitsproperty located within Alaska\u2019s borders\u201d) (emphasis\nadded). The Bayh-Dole Act does not confer title to federally funded\ninventions on contractors or authorize contractors to unilaterally\ntake title to those inventions; it simply assures contractors that\nthey may keep title to whatever it is they already have. Such a\nprovision makes sense in a statute specifying the respective rights\nand responsibilities of federal contractors and the Government.The Bayh-Dole Act states that it \u201ctake[s]\nprecedence over any other Act which would require a disposition of\nrights in subject inventions \u2026 that is inconsistent with\u201d the Act.\n35 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7210(a). The United States asamicus\ncuriaeargues that this provision operates to displace the\nbasic principle, codified in the Patent Act, that an inventor owns\nthe rights to his invention. See Brief for United States 21. But\nbecause the Bayh-Dole Act, including \u00a7210(a), applies only to\n\u201csubject inventions\u201d\u2014\u201cinventions of the contractor\u201d\u2014it does not\ndisplace an inventor\u2019s antecedent title to his invention. Only when\nan invention belongs to the contractor does the Bayh-Dole Act come\ninto play. The Act\u2019s disposition of rights\u2014like much of the rest of\nthe Bayh-Dole Act\u2014serves to clarify the order of priority of rights\nbetween the Federal Government and a federal contractor in a\nfederally funded invention that already belongs to the contractor.\nNothing more.[Footnote 5]The isolated provisions of the Bayh-Dole Act\ndealing with inventors\u2019 rights in subject inventions are consistent\nwith our construction of the Act. Under the Act, a federal agency\nmay \u201cgrant requests for retention of rights by the inventor \u2026 [i]f\na contractor does not elect to retain title to a subject\ninvention.\u201d \u00a7202(d). If an employee inventor never had title to his\ninvention because title vested in the contractor by operation of\nlaw\u2014as Stanford submits\u2014it would be odd to allow the Government to\ngrant \u201crequests for retention of rights by the inventor.\u201d By using\nthe word \u201cretention,\u201d \u00a7202(d) assumes that the inventor had rights\nin the subject invention at some point, undermining the notion that\nthe Act automatically vests title to federally funded inventions in\nfederal contractors.[Footnote\n6]The limited scope of the Act\u2019s procedural\nprotections also bolsters our conclusion. The Bayh-Dole Act\nexpressly confers on contractors the right to challenge a\nGovernment-imposed impediment to retaining title to a subject\ninvention. \u00a7202(b)(4). As Roche correctly notes, however, \u201cthe Act\ncontains not a single procedural protection for third parties that\nhave neither sought nor received federal funds,\u201d such as\ncooperating private research institutions. Brief for Respondents\n29. Nor does the Bayh-Dole Act allow inventors employed by federal\ncontractors to contest their employer\u2019s claim to a subject\ninvention. The Act, for example, does not expressly permit an\ninterested third party or an inventor to challenge a claim that a\nparticular invention was supported by federal funding. In a world\nin which there is frequent collaboration between private entities,\ninventors, and federal contractors, see Brief for Pharmaceutical\nResearch and Manufacturers of America asAmicus Curiae22\u201323, that absence would be deeply troubling. But the lack of\nprocedures protecting inventor and third-party rights makes perfect\nsense if the Act applies only when a federal contractor has already\nacquired title to an inventor\u2019s interest. In that case, there is no\nneed to protect inventor or third-party rights, because the only\nrights at issue are those of the contractor and the Government.The Bayh-Dole Act applies to subject\ninventions \u201cconceivedorfirst actually reduced to\npractice in the performance of work\u201d \u201cfunded in wholeor in\npartby the Federal Government.\u201d 35 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a7201(e),\n201(b) (emphasis added). Under Stanford\u2019s construction of the Act,\ntitle to one of its employee\u2019s inventions could vest in the\nUniversity even if the invention was conceived before the inventor\nbecame a University employee, so long as the invention\u2019s reduction\nto practice was supported by federal funding. What is more,\nStanford\u2019s reading suggests that the school would obtain title to\none of its employee\u2019s inventions even if only one dollar of federal\nfunding was applied toward the invention\u2019s conception or reduction\nto practice.It would be noteworthy enough for Congress to\nsupplant one of the fundamental precepts of patent law and deprive\ninventors of rights in their own inventions. To do so under such\nunusual terms would be truly surprising. We are confident that if\nCongress had intended such a sea change in intellectual property\nrights it would have said so clearly\u2014not obliquely through an\nambiguous definition of \u201csubject invention\u201d and an idiosyncratic\nuse of the word \u201cretain.\u201d Cf.Whitmanv.American\nTrucking Assns., Inc.,531 U. S. 457, 468\n(2001) (\u201cCongress \u2026 does not alter the fundamental details of a\nregulatory scheme in vague terms or ancillary provisions\u201d).Though unnecessary to our conclusion, it is\nworth noting that our construction of the Bayh-Dole Act is\nreflected in the common practice among parties operating under the\nAct. Contractors generally institute policies to obtain assignments\nfrom their employees. See Brief for Respondents 34; Brief for\nPharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America asAmicus\nCuriae13\u201318. Agencies that grant funds to federal contractors\ntypically expect those contractors to obtain assignments. So it is\nwith NIH, the agency that granted the federal funds at issue in\nthis case. In guidance documents made available to contractors, NIH\nhas made clear that \u201c[b]y law, an inventor has initial ownership of\nan invention\u00a0\u201d and that contractors should therefore \u201chave in\nplace employee agreements requiring an inventor to \u2018assign\u2019 or give\nownership of an invention to the organization upon acceptance of\nFederal funds.\u201d NIH Policies, Procedures, and Forms, A \u201c20\u201320\u201d View\nof Invention Reporting to the National Institutes of Health (Sept.\n22, 1995). Such guidance would be unnecessary if Stanford\u2019s reading\nof the statute were correct.Stanford contends that reading the Bayh-Dole\nAct as not vesting title to federally funded inventions in federal\ncontractors \u201cfundamentally undermin[es]\u201d the Act\u2019s frame-work and\nseverely threatens its continued \u201csuccessful application.\u201d Brief\nfor Petitioner 45. We do not agree. As just noted, universities\ntypically enter into agreements with their employees requiring the\nassignment to the university of rights in inventions. With an\neffective assignment, those inventions\u2014if federally funded\u2014become\n\u201csubject inventions\u201d under the Act, and the statute as a practical\nmatter works pretty much the way Stanford says it should. The only\nsignificant difference is that it does so without violence to the\nbasic principle of patent law that inventors own their\ninventions.The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the\nFederal Circuit is affirmed.It is so ordered.Footnote 1Roche submitted a host of other claims to the\nDistrict Court, including that it had \u201cshop rights\u201d to the patents\nand was entitled to a license to use the patents. See 583\nF.\u00a03d 832, 838 (CA Fed. 2009). None of those claims is now\nbefore us; we deal only with Roche\u2019s claim to co-ownership to rebut\nStanford\u2019s standing to bring an infringement action.Footnote 2Because the Federal Circuit\u2019s interpretation\nof the relevant assignment agreements is not an issue on which we\ngranted certiorari, we have no occasion to pass on the validity of\nthe lower court\u2019s construction of those agreements.Footnote 3The patent was signed by President George\nWashington, Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson, and Attorney\nGeneral Edmund Randolph. See Maxey, Samuel Hopkins, The Holder of\nthe First U. S. Patent: A Study of Failure, 122 Pa. Magazine of\nHist. and Biography 6 (1998).Footnote 4The dissent suggests that \u201cwe could interpret\nthe Bayh-Dole Act as ordinarily assuming, and thereby ordinarily\nrequiring, an assignment of patent rights by the federally funded\nemployee to the federally funded employer.\u201dPost, at 8.\nThat suggestion is based in large part on Executive Order 10096,\nwhich \u201cgoverns Federal Government employee-to-employer patent right\nassignments.\u201dPost,at 9. Lest there be any doubt,\nemployees of nonfederal entities that have federal funding\ncontracts\u2014like Holodniy\u2014arenotfederal employees. And\nthere is no equivalent executive order governing invention rights\nwith respect to federally funded research; that issue is of course\naddressed by the Bayh-Dole Act.Footnote 5Far from superseding the Patent Act in such a\nbackhanded way, it is clear that \u00a7210(a)\u2019s concern is far narrower.\nThat provision specifies 21 different statutory provisions that the\nBayh-Dole Act \u201ctake[s] precedence over,\u201d the vast majority of which\ndeal with the division of ownership in certain inventions between a\ncontractor and the Government. 35 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a7210(a)(1)\u2013(21);\nsee,e.g.,\u00a7\u00a7210(a)(19)\u2013(20) (the Bayh-Dole Act takes\nprecedence over \u201csection 6(b) of the Solar Photovoltaic Energy\nResearch Development and Demonstration Act\u201d and \u201csection 12 of the\nNative Latex Commercialization and Economic Development Act\u201d).Footnote 6Stanford contends that it cannot be the case\n\u201cthat the contractor can only \u2018retain title\u2019 to an invention that\nit already owns, while an inventor may be considered for\n\u2018retention\u2019 of title only when he has assigned title away.\u201d Reply\nBrief for Petitioner 8. That argument has some force. But there may\nbe situations where an inventor, by the terms of an assignment, has\nsubsidiary rights in an invention to which a contractor has title,\nas \u00a7202(d) suggests. Compare \u00a7202(d) (\u201cretention ofrights\u201d) with \u00a7202(a) (\u201cretaintitle\u201d) (emphasis\nadded). And at the end of the day, it is Stanford\u2019s contention that\n\u201cretain\u201d must be \u201cread as a synonym for \u2018acquire\u2019 or\n\u2018receive\u2019\u00a0\u201d that dooms its argument on this point.
