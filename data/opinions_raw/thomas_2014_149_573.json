ANTHONY LIST, et\u00a0al., PETITIONERS v. STEVEN\nDRIEHAUS et\u00a0al.on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for\nthe sixth circuit[June 16, 2014]Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the Court.Petitioners in this case seek to challenge an Ohio statute that\nprohibits certain \u201cfalse statements\u201d during the course of a\npolitical campaign. The question in this caseis whether their\npreenforcement challenge to that law is justiciable\u2014and in\nparticular, whether they have alleged a sufficiently imminent\ninjury for the purposes of Article III. We conclude that they\nhave.IThe Ohio statute at issue prohibits certain \u201cfalse statement[s]\u201d\n\u201cduring the course of any campaign for nomination or election to\npublic office or office of a political party.\u201d Ohio Rev. Code Ann.\n\u00a73517.21(B) (Lexis 2013). As relevant here, the statute makes it a\ncrime for any person to \u201c[m]ake a false statement concerning the\nvoting record of a candidate or public official,\u201d \u00a73517.21(B)(9),\nor to \u201c[p]ost, publish, circulate, distribute, or otherwise\ndisseminate a false statement concerning a candidate, either\nknowing the same to be false or with reckless disregard of whether\nit was false or not,\u201d \u00a73517.21(B)(10).[1]\u201c[A]ny person\u201d acting on personal knowledge may file a complaint\nwith the Ohio Elections Commission (or Commission) alleging a\nviolation of the false statement statute. \u00a73517.153(A) (Lexis Supp.\n2014). If filed within 60 days of a primary election or 90 days of\na general election, the complaint is referred to a panel of at\nleast three Commission members. \u00a7\u00a73517.156(A), (B)(1) (Lexis 2013).\nThe panel must then hold an expedited hearing, generally within two\nbusiness days, \u00a73517.156(B)(1), to determine whether there is\nprobable cause to believe the alleged violation occurred,\n\u00a73517.156(C). Upon a finding of probable cause, the full Commission\nmust, within 10 days, hold a hearing on the complaint.\n\u00a73517.156(C)(2); see also Ohio Admin. Code \u00a73517\u20131\u201310(E)\n(2008).The statute authorizes the full Commission to subpoena witnesses\nand compel production of documents. Ohio Rev. Code Ann.\n\u00a73517.153(B) (Lexis Supp. 2014). At the full hearing, the parties\nmay make opening and closing statements and present evidence. Ohio\nAdmin. Code \u00a7\u00a73517\u20131\u201311(B)(2)(c), (d), (g). If the Commission\ndetermines by \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d that a party has\nviolated the false statement law, the Commission \u201cshall\u201d refer the\nmatter to the relevant county prosecutor. Ohio Rev. Code Ann.\n\u00a7\u00a73517.155(D)(1)\u2013(2) (Lexis Supp. 2014). Alternatively, the\nCommission\u2019s regulations state that it may simply issue a\nreprimand. See Ohio Admin. Code \u00a73517\u20131\u201314(D). Violation of the\nfalse statement statute is a first-degree misdemeanor punishable by\nup to six months of imprisonment, a fine up to $5,000, or both.\nOhio Rev. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a73599.40 (Lexis 2013), 3517.992(V) (Lexis\nSupp. 2014). A second conviction under the false statement statute\nis a fourth-degree felony that carries a mandatory penalty of\ndisfranchisement. \u00a73599.39.IIPetitioner Susan B. Anthony List (SBA) is a \u201cpro-life advocacy\norganization.\u201d 525 Fed. Appx. 415, 416 (CA6 2013). During the 2010\nelection cycle, SBA publicly criticized various Members of Congress\nwho voted for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA).\nIn particular, it issued a press release announcing its plan to\n\u201ceducat[e] voters that their representative voted for a health care\nbill that includes taxpayer-funded abortion.\u201d App. 49\u201350. The press\nrelease listed then-Congressman Steve Driehaus, a respondent here,\nwho voted for the ACA. SBA also sought to display a billboard in\nDriehaus\u2019 district condemning that vote. The planned billboard\nwould have read: \u201cShame on Steve Driehaus! Driehaus voted FOR\ntaxpayer-funded abortion.\u201d Id., at 37. The advertising company that\nowned the billboard space refused to display that message, however,\nafter Driehaus\u2019 counsel threatened legal action.On October 4, 2010, Driehaus filed a complaint with the Ohio\nElections Commission alleging, as relevant here, that SBA had\nviolated \u00a7\u00a73517.21(B)(9) and (10) by falsely stating that he had\nvoted for \u201ctaxpayer-funded abortion.\u201d[2] Because\nDriehaus filed his complaint 29 days before the general election, a\nCommission panel held an expedited hearing. On October 14, 2010,\nthe panel voted 2 to 1 to find probable cause that a violation had\nbeen committed. The full Commission set a hearing date for 10\nbusiness days later, and the parties commenced discovery. Driehaus\nnoticed depositions of three SBA employees as well as individuals\naffiliated with similar advocacy groups. He also issued discovery\nrequests for all evidence that SBA would rely on at the Commission\nhearing, as well as SBA\u2019s communications with allied organizations,\npolitical party committees, and Members of Congress and their\nstaffs.On October 18, 2010\u2014after the panel\u2019s probable-cause\ndetermination, but before the scheduled Commission hearing\u2014SBA\nfiled suit in Federal District Court, seek-ing declaratory and\ninjunctive relief on the ground that \u00a7\u00a73517.21(B)(9) and (10)\nviolate the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States\nConstitution. The District Court stayed the action under Younger v.\nHarris, 401 U.\u00a0S. 37 (1971) , pending completion of the\nCommission proceedings. The Sixth Circuit denied SBA\u2019s motion for\nan injunction pending appeal. Driehaus and SBA eventually agreed to\npostpone the full Commission hearing until after the election.When Driehaus lost the election in November 2010, he moved to\nwithdraw his complaint against SBA. The Commission granted the\nmotion with SBA\u2019s consent. Once the Commission proceedings were\nterminated, the District Court lifted the stay and SBA amended its\ncomplaint. As relevant here, the amended complaint alleged that\nOhio Rev. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a73517.21(B)(9) and (10) are unconstitutional\nboth facially and as applied. Specifically, the complaint alleged\nthat SBA\u2019s speech about Driehaus had been chilled; that SBA\n\u201cintends to engage in substantially similar activity in the\nfuture\u201d; and that it \u201cface[d] the prospect of its speech and\nassociational rights again being chilled and burdened,\u201d because\n\u201c[a]ny complainant can hale [it] before the [Commission], forcing\nit to expend time and resources defending itself.\u201d App.\n121\u2013122.The District Court consolidated SBA\u2019s suit with a separate suit\nbrought by petitioner Coalition Opposed to Ad-ditional Spending and\nTaxes (COAST), an advocacy orga-nization that also alleged that the\nsame Ohio falsestatement provisions are unconstitutional both\nfacially and as applied.[3] According to its\namended complaint, COAST intended to disseminate a mass e-mail and\nother materials criticizing Driehaus\u2019 vote for the ACA as a vote\n\u201cto fund abortions with tax dollars,\u201d but refrained from doing so\nbecause of the Commission proceedings against SBA. Id., at 146,\n148, 162. COAST further alleged that it \u201cdesires to make the same\nor similar statements about other federal candidates who voted for\u201d\nthe ACA, but that fear \u201cof finding itself subject to the same fate\u201d\nas SBA has deterred it from doing so. Id., at 149, 157.[4]The District Court dismissed both suits as non-justiciable,\nconcluding that neither suit presented a sufficiently concrete\ninjury for purposes of standing or ripeness. The Sixth Circuit\naffirmed on ripeness grounds. 525 Fed. Appx. 415. The Court of\nAppeals analyzed three factors to assess whether the case was ripe\nfor review: (1) the likelihood that the alleged harm would come to\npass; (2) whether the factual record was sufficiently developed;\nand (3) the hardship to the parties if judicial relief were\ndenied.Regarding the first factor, the Sixth Circuit concluded that\nSBA\u2019s prior injuries\u2014the probable-cause determination and the\nbillboard rejection\u2014\u201cdo not help it show an imminent threat of\nfuture prosecution,\u201d particularly where \u201cthe Commission never found\nthat SBA . . . violated Ohio\u2019s false-statement law.\u201d Id., at 420.\nThe court further reasoned that it was speculative whether any\nperson would file a complaint with the Commission in the future, in\npart because Driehaus took a 2-year assignment with the Peace Corps\nin Africa after losing the election. Finally, the court noted that\nSBA has not alleged that \u201cit plans to lie or recklessly disregard\nthe veracity of its speech\u201d in the future, but rather maintains\nthat the statements it intends to make are factually true. Id., at\n422.As for the remaining factors, the court concluded that the\nfactual record was insufficiently developed with respect to the\ncontent of SBA\u2019s future speech, and that withholding judicial\nrelief would not result in undue hardship because, in the time\nperiod leading up to the 2010 election, SBA continued to\ncommunicate its message even after Commission proceedings were\ninitiated. The Sixth Circuit therefore determined that SBA\u2019s suit\nwas not ripe for review, and that its analysis as to SBA compelled\nthe same conclusion with respect to COAST.We granted certiorari, 571 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2014), and now\nreverse.IIIAArticle III of the Constitution limits the jurisdiction of\nfederal courts to \u201cCases\u201d and \u201cControversies.\u201d U.\u00a0S. Const.,\nArt. III, \u00a72. The doctrine of standing gives meaning to these\nconstitutional limits by \u201cidentify[ing] those disputes which are\nappropriately resolved through the judicial process.\u201d[5] Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.\u00a0S. 555,\n560 (1992) . \u201cThe law of Article III standing, which is built on\nseparation-of-powers principles, serves to prevent the judicial\nprocess from being used to usurp the powers of the political\nbranches.\u201d Clapper v. Amnesty Int\u2019l USA, 568 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___,\n(2013) (slip op., at 9). To establish Article III standing, a\nplaintiff must show (1) an \u201cinjury in fact,\u201d (2) a sufficient\n\u201ccausal connection between the injuryand the conduct complained\nof,\u201d and (3) a \u201clikel[ihood]\u201d that the injury \u201cwill be redressed by\na favorable decision.\u201d Lujan, supra, at 560\u2013561 (internal quotation\nmarksomitted).This case concerns the injury-in-fact requirement, which helps\nto ensure that the plaintiff has a \u201cpersonal stake in the outcome\nof the controversy.\u201d Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.\u00a0S. 490, 498\n(1975) (internal quotation marks omitted). An injury sufficient to\nsatisfy Article III must be \u201cconcrete and particularized\u201d and\n\u201cactual or imminent, not \u2018conjectural\u2019 or \u2018hypothetical.\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nLujan, supra, at 560 (some internal question marks omitted). An\nallegation of future injury may suffice if the threatened injury is\n\u201ccertainly impending,\u201d or there is a \u201c\u00a0\u2018substantial risk\u2019 that\nthe harm will occur.\u201d Clapper, 568 U.\u00a0S., at ___, ___, n. 5\n(slip op., at 10, 15, n.\u00a05) (emphasis deleted and internal\nquotation marks omitted).\u201c\u00a0\u2018\u00a0The party invoking federal jurisdiction bears the\nburden of establishing\u2019 standing.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op., at 12).\n\u201c[E]ach element must be supported in the same way as any other\nmatter on which the plaintiff bears the burden of proof, i.e., with\nthe manner and degree of evidence required at the successive stages\nof the litigation.\u201d Lujan, supra, at 561.BOne recurring issue in our cases is determining when the\nthreatened enforcement of a law creates an Article III injury. When\nan individual is subject to such a threat, an actual arrest,\nprosecution, or other enforcement action is not a prerequisite to\nchallenging the law. See Steffel v. Thompson, 415 U.\u00a0S. 452,\n459 (1974) (\u201c[I]t is not necessary that petitioner first expose\nhimself to actual arrest or prosecution to be entitled to challenge\na statute that he claims deters the exercise of his constitutional\nrights\u201d); see also MedImmune, Inc. v. Genentech, Inc., 549\nU.\u00a0S. 118 \u2013129 (2007) (\u201c[W]here threatened action by\ngovernment is concerned, we do not require a plaintiff to expose\nhimself to liability before bringing suit to challenge the basis\nfor the threat\u201d). Instead, we have permitted pre-enforcement review\nunder circumstances that render the threatened enforcement\nsufficiently imminent. Specifically, we have held that a plaintiff\nsatisfies the injury-in-fact requirement where he alleges \u201can\nintention to engage in a course of conduct arguably affected with a\nconstitutional interest, but proscribed by a statute, and there\nexists a credible threat of prosecution thereunder.\u201d Babbitt v.\nFarm Workers, 442 U.\u00a0S. 289, 298 (1979) . Several of our cases\nillustrate the circumstances under which plaintiffs may bring a\npreenforcement challenge consistent with Article III.In Steffel, for example, police officers threatened to arrest\npetitioner and his companion for distributing handbills protesting\nthe Vietnam War. Petitioner left to avoid arrest; his companion\nremained and was arrested and charged with criminal trespass.\nPetitioner sought a declaratory judgment that the trespass statute\nwas unconstitutional as applied to him.We determined that petitioner had alleged a credible threat of\nenforcement: He had been warned to stop handbilling and threatened\nwith prosecution if he disobeyed; he stated his desire to continue\nhandbilling (an activity he claimed was constitutionally\nprotected); and his companion\u2019s prosecution showed that his\n\u201cconcern with arrest\u201d was not \u201c\u00a0\u2018\u00a0chimerical.\u2019\u00a0\u201d 415\nU.\u00a0S., at 459. Under those circumstances, we said, \u201cit is not\nnecessary that petitioner first expose himself to actual arrest or\nprosecution to be entitled to challenge a statute that he claims\ndeters the exercise of his constitutional rights.\u201d Ibid.In Babbitt, we considered a preenforcement challenge to a\nstatute that made it an unfair labor practice to encourage\nconsumers to boycott an \u201cagricultural product .\u00a0.\u00a0. by\nthe use of dishonest, untruthful and deceptive publicity.\u2019\u00a0\u201d\n442 U.\u00a0S., at 301. The plaintiffs contended that the law\n\u201cunconstitutionally penalize[d] inaccuracies inadvertently uttered\nin the course of consumer appeals.\u201d Ibid.Building on Steffel, we explained that a plaintiff could bring a\npreenforcement suit when he \u201chas alleged an intention to engage in\na course of conduct arguably af-fected with a constitutional\ninterest, but proscribed by a statute, and there exists a credible\nthreat of prosecution thereunder.\u201d Babbit, supra, at 298. We found\nthose circumstances present in Babbitt. In that case, the law \u201con\nits face proscribe[d] dishonest, untruthful, and deceptive\npublicity.\u201d 442 U.\u00a0S., at 302. The plaintiffs had \u201cactively\nengaged in consumer publicity campaigns in the past\u201d and alleged\n\u201can intention to continue\u201d those campaigns in the future. Id., at\n301. And although they did not \u201cplan to propagate untruths,\u201d they\nargued that \u201c\u00a0\u2018\u00a0erroneous statement is inevitable in free\ndebate.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Ibid. We concluded that the plaintiffs\u2019 fear of\nprosecution was not \u201cimaginary or wholly speculative,\u201d and that\ntheir challenge to the consumer publicity provision presented an\nArticle III case or controversy. Id., at 302.Two other cases bear mention. In Virginia v. American\nBooksellers Assn. Inc., 484 U.\u00a0S. 383 (1988) , we held that\nbooksellers could seek preenforcement review of a law making it a\ncrime to \u201c\u00a0\u2018knowingly display for commercial purpose\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nmaterial that is \u201c\u00a0\u2018harmful to juveniles\u2019\u00a0\u201d as defined by\nthe statute. Id., at 386. At trial, the booksellers introduced 16\nbooks they believed were covered by the statute and testified that\ncostly compliance measures would be necessary to avoid prosecution\nfor displaying such books. Just as in Babbitt and Steffel, we\ndetermined that the \u201cpre-enforcement nature\u201d of the suit was not\n\u201ctroubl[ing]\u201d because the plaintiffs had \u201calleged an actual and\nwell-founded fear that the law will be enforced against them.\u201d 484\nU.\u00a0S., at 393.Finally, in Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project, 561 U.\u00a0S. 1\n(2010) , we considered a preenforcement challenge to a law that\ncriminalized \u201c\u00a0\u2018\u00a0knowingly provid[ing] mate-rial support\nor resources to a foreign terrorist organization.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Id., at\n8. The plaintiffs claimed that they had provided support to groups\ndesignated as terrorist organizations prior to the law\u2019s enactment\nand would provide similar support in the future. The Government had\ncharged 150 persons with violating the law and declined to disavow\nprosecution if the plaintiffs resumed their support of the\ndesignated organizations. We held that the claims were justiciable:\nThe plaintiffs faced a \u201c\u00a0\u2018credible threat\u2019\u00a0\u201d of\nenforcement and \u201c\u00a0\u2018should not be required to await and undergo\na criminal prosecution as the sole means of seeking relief.\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nId., at 15.IVHere, SBA and COAST contend that the threat of enforcement of\nthe false statement statute amounts to an Article III injury in\nfact. We agree: Petitioners have alleged a credible threat of\nenforcement. See Babbitt, 442 U.\u00a0S., at 298.AFirst, petitioners have alleged \u201can intention to engage in a\ncourse of conduct arguably affected with a constitutional\ninterest.\u201d Ibid. Both petitioners have pleaded specific statements\nthey intend to make in future election cycles. SBA has already\nstated that representatives who voted for the ACA supported\n\u201ctaxpayer-funded abortion,\u201d and it has alleged an \u201cinten[t] to\nengage in substantially similar activity in the future.\u201d App.\n49\u201350, 122. See also Humanitarian Law Project, supra, at 15\u201316\n(observing that plaintiffs had previously provided support to\ngroups designated as terrorist organizations and alleged they\n\u201cwould provide similar support [to the same terrorist\norganizations] again if the statute\u2019s allegedly unconstitutional\nbar were lifted\u201d). COAST has alleged that it previously intended to\ndisseminate materials criticizing a vote for the ACA as a vote \u201cto\nfund abortions with tax dollars,\u201d and that it \u201cdesires to make the\nsame or similar statements about other federal candidates who voted\nfor [the ACA].\u201d App. 146, 149, 162. Because petitioners\u2019 intended\nfuture conduct concerns political speech, it is certainly \u201caffected\nwith a constitutional interest.\u201d Babbitt, supra, at 298; see also\nMonitor Patriot Co. v. Roy, 401 U.\u00a0S. 265, 272 (1971) (\u201c[T]he\nconstitutional guarantee has its fullest and most urgent\napplication precisely to the conduct of campaigns for political\noffice\u201d).BNext, petitioners\u2019 intended future conduct is\n\u201carguably.\u00a0.\u00a0. proscribed by [the] statute\u201d they wish to\nchallenge. Babbitt, supra, at 298. The Ohio false statement law\nsweeps broadly, see supra, at 1\u20132, and n.\u00a01., and covers the\nsubject matter of petitioners\u2019 intended speech. Both SBA and COAST\nhave alleged an intent to \u201c[m]ake\u201d statements \u201cconcerning the\nvoting record of a candidate or public official,\u201d \u00a73517.21(B)(9),\nand to \u201cdisseminate\u201d statements \u201cconcerning a candidate\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. to promote the election, nomination, or defeat of\nthe candidate,\u201d \u00a73517.21(B)(10). And, a Commission panel here\nalready found probable cause to believe that SBA violated the\nstatute when it stated that Driehaus had supported\u201ctaxpayer-funded\nabortion\u201d\u2014the same sort of statement petitioners plan to\ndisseminate in the future. Under these circumstances, we have no\ndifficulty concluding that petitioners\u2019 intended speech is\n\u201carguably proscribed\u201d by the law.Respondents incorrectly rely on Golden v. Zwickler, 394 U. S.\n103 (1969) . In that case, the plaintiff had previously distributed\nanonymous leaflets criticizing a particular Congressman who had\nsince left office. Id., at 104\u2013106, and n.\u00a02. The Court\ndismissed the plaintiff\u2019s challenge to the electoral leafletting\nban as nonjusticiable because his \u201csole concern was literature\nrelating to the Congressman and his record,\u201d and \u201cit was most\nunlikely that the Congressman would again be a candidate.\u201d Id., at\n109 (emphasis added). Under those circumstances, any threat of\nfuture prosecution was \u201cwholly conjectural.\u201d Ibid.Here, by contrast, petitioners\u2019 speech focuses on the broader\nissue of support for the ACA, not on the voting record of a single\ncandidate. See Reply Brief 4\u20135 (identifying other elected officials\nwho plan to seek reelection as potential objects of SBA\u2019s\ncriticisms). Because petitioners\u2019 alleged future speech is not\ndirected exclusively at Driehaus, it does not matter whether he\n\u201cmay run for office again.\u201d Brief for Respondents 33 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). As long as petitioners continue to engage\nin comparable electoral speech regarding support for the ACA, that\nspeech will remain arguably proscribed by Ohio\u2019s false statement\nstatute.Respondents, echoing the Sixth Circuit, contend that SBA\u2019s fears\nof enforcement are misplaced because SBA has not said it\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018plans to lie or recklessly disregard the veracity of its\nspeech.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Id., at 15 (quoting 525 Fed. Appx., at 422). The\nSixth Circuit reasoned that because SBA \u201ccan only be liable for\nmaking a statement \u2018knowing\u2019 it is false,\u201d SBA\u2019s insistence that\nits speech is factually true \u201cmakes the possibility of prosecution\nfor uttering such statements exceedingly slim.\u201d Id., at 422.The Sixth Circuit misses the point. SBA\u2019s insistence that the\nallegations in its press release were true did not prevent the\nCommission panel from finding probable cause to believe that SBA\nhad violated the law the first time around. And, there is every\nreason to think that similar speech in the future will result in\nsimilar proceedings, notwithstanding SBA\u2019s belief in the truth of\nits allegations. Nothing in this Court\u2019s decisions requires a\nplaintiff who wishes to challenge the constitutionality of a law to\nconfess that he will in fact violate that law. See, e.g., Babbitt,\n442 U.\u00a0S., at 301 (case was justiciable even though plaintiffs\ndisavowed any intent to \u201cpropagate untruths\u201d).CFinally, the threat of future enforcement of the false statement\nstatute is substantial. Most obviously, there is a history of past\nenforcement here: SBA was the subject of a complaint in a recent\nelection cycle. We have observed that past enforcement against the\nsame conduct is good evidence that the threat of enforcement is not\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018\u00a0chimerical.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Steffel, 415 U.\u00a0S., at 459;\ncf. Clapper, 568 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 12) (plaintiffs\u2019\ntheory of standing was \u201csubstantially undermine[d]\u201d by their\n\u201cfail[ure] to offer any evidence that their communications ha[d]\nbeen monitored\u201d under the challenged statute). Here, the threat is\neven more substantial given that the Commission panel actually\nfound probable cause to believe that SBA\u2019s speech violated the\nfalse statement statute. Indeed future complainants may well\n\u201cinvoke the prior probable-cause finding to prove that SBA\nknowingly lied.\u201d Brief for Petitioners 32.The credibility of that threat is bolstered by the fact that\nauthority to file a complaint with the Commission is not limited to\na prosecutor or an agency. Instead, the false statement statute\nallows \u201cany person\u201d with knowledge of the purported violation to\nfile a complaint. \u00a73517.153(A). Because the universe of potential\ncomplainants is not restricted to state officials who are\nconstrained by explicit guidelines or ethical obligations, there is\na real risk of complaints from, for example, political opponents.\nSee Brief for Michael DeWine, Attorney General of Ohio, as Amicus\nCuriae 8 (hereinafter DeWine Brief); see also id., at 6 (noting\nthat \u201cthe Commission has no system for weeding out frivolous\ncomplaints\u201d). And petitioners, who intend to criticize candidates\nfor political office, are easy targets.Finally, Commission proceedings are not a rare occurrence.\nPetitioners inform us that the Commission \u201c\u00a0\u2018handles about 20\nto 80 false statement complaints per year,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Brief for\nPetitioners 46, and respondents do not deny that the Commission\nfrequently fields complaints alleging violations of the false\nstatement statute. Cf. Humani-tarian Law Project, 561 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 16 (noting that there had been numerous prior prosecutions under\nthe challenged statute). Moreover, respondents have not disavowed\nenforcement if petitioners make similar statements in the future.\nSee Tr. of Oral Arg. 29\u201330; see also Humanitarian Law Project,\nsupra, at 16 (\u201cThe Government has not argued to this Court that\nplaintiffs will not be prosecuted if they do what they say they\nwish to do\u201d). In fact, the specter of enforcement is so substantial\nthat the owner of the billboard refused to display SBA\u2019s message\nafter receiving a letter threatening Commission proceedings. On\nthese facts, the prospect of future enforcement is far from\n\u201cimaginary or speculative.\u201d Babbitt, supra, at 298.We take the threatened Commission proceedings into account\nbecause administrative action, like arrest or prosecution, may give\nrise to harm sufficient to justify pre-enforcement review. See Ohio\nCivil Rights Comm\u2019n v. Dayton Christian Schools, Inc., 477\nU.\u00a0S. 619 \u2013626, n.\u00a01 (1986) (\u201cIf a reasonable threat of\nprosecution creates a ripe controversy, we fail to see how the\nactual filing of the administrative action threatening sanctions in\nthis case does not\u201d). The burdens that Commission proceedings can\nimpose on electoral speech are of particular concern here. As the\nOhio Attorney General himself notes, the \u201cpractical effect\u201d of the\nOhio false statement scheme is \u201cto permit a private complainant\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. to gain a campaign advantage without ever having to\nprove the falsity of a statement.\u201d DeWine Brief 7. \u201c[C]omplainants\nmay time their submissions to achieve maximum disruption of their\npolitical opponents while calculating that an ultimate decision on\nthe merits will be deferred until after the relevant election.\u201d\nId., at 14\u201315. Moreover, the target of a false statement complaint\nmay be forced to divert significant time and resources to hire\nlegal counsel and respond to discovery requests in the crucial days\nleading up to an election. And where, as here, a Commission panel\nissues a preelection probable-cause finding, \u201csuch a determination\nitself may be viewed [by the electorate] as a sanction by the\nState.\u201d Id., at 13.Although the threat of Commission proceedings is a substantial\none, we need not decide whether that threat standing alone gives\nrise to an Article III injury. The burdensome Commission\nproceedings here are backed by the additional threat of criminal\nprosecution. We conclude that the combination of those two threats\nsuffices to create an Article III injury under the circumstances of\nthis case. See Babbitt, supra, at 302, n.\u00a013 (In addition to\nthe threat of criminal sanctions, \u201cthe prospect of issuance of an\nadministrative cease-and-desist order or a court-ordered injunction\nagainst such prohibited conduct provides substantial additional\nsupport for the conclusion that appellees\u2019 challenge\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. is justiciable\u201d (citations omitted)).That conclusion holds true as to both SBA and COAST.\nRespondents, relying on Younger v. Harris, 401 U. S. 37 (1971) ,\nappear to suggest that COAST lacks standing because it refrained\nfrom actually disseminating its planned speech in order to avoid\nCommission proceedings of its own. See Brief for Respondents 26\u201327,\n34. In Younger, the plaintiff had been indicted for distributing\nleaflets in violation of the California Criminal Syndicalism Act.\nWhen he challenged the constitutionality of the law in federal\ncourt, several other plaintiffs intervened, arguing that their own\nspeech was inhibited by Harris\u2019 prosecution. The Court concluded\nthat only the plaintiff had standing because the intervenors \u201cd[id]\nnot claim that they ha[d] ever been threatened with prosecution,\nthat a prosecution [wa]s likely, or even that a prosecution [wa]s\nremotely possible.\u201d 401 U.\u00a0S., at 42.That is not this case. Unlike the intervenors in Younger, COAST\nhas alleged an intent to engage in the same speech that was the\nsubject of a prior enforcement proceeding. Also unlike the\nintervenors in Younger, who had never been threatened with\nprosecution, COAST has been the subject of Commission proceedings\nin the past. See, e.g., COAST Candidates PAC v. Ohio Elections\nComm\u2019n, 543 Fed. Appx. 490 (CA6 2013). COAST is far more akin to\nthe plaintiff in Steffel, who was not arrested alongside his\nhandbilling companion but was nevertheless threatened with\nprosecution for similar speech. 415 U.\u00a0S., at 459.In sum, we find that both SBA and COAST have alleged a credible\nthreat of enforcement.VIn concluding that petitioners\u2019 claims were not justiciable, the\nSixth Circuit separately considered two other factors: whether the\nfactual record was sufficiently developed, and whether hardship to\nthe parties would result if judicial relief is denied at this stage\nin the proceedings. 525 Fed. Appx., at 419. Respondents contend\nthat these \u201cprudential ripeness\u201d factors confirm that the claims at\nissue are nonjusticiable. Brief for Respondents 17. But we have\nalready concluded that petitioners have alleged a sufficient\nArticle III injury. To the extent respondents would have us deem\npetitioners\u2019 claims nonjusticiable \u201con grounds that are\n\u2018prudential,\u2019 rather than constitutional,\u201d \u201c[t]hat request is in\nsome tension with our recent reaffirmation of the principle that \u2018a\nfederal court\u2019s obligation to hear and decide\u2019 cases within its\njurisdiction \u2018is virtually unflagging.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Lexmark Int\u2019l, Inc.\nv. Static Control Components, Inc., 572 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2014)\n(slip op., at 6) (quoting Sprint Communications, Inc. v. Jacobs,\n571 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 6); some internal\nquotation marks omitted).In any event, we need not resolve the continuing vitality of the\nprudential ripeness doctrine in this case because the \u201cfitness\u201d and\n\u201chardship\u201d factors are easily satisfied here. First, petitioners\u2019\nchallenge to the Ohio false statement statute presents an issue\nthat is \u201cpurely legal, and will not be clarified by further factual\ndevelopment.\u201d Thomas v. Union Carbide Agricultural Products Co.,\n473 U.\u00a0S. 568, 581 (1985) . And denying prompt judicial review\nwould impose a substantial hardship on petitioners, forcing them to\nchoose between refraining from core political speech on the one\nhand, or engaging in that speech and risking costly Commission\nproceedings and criminal prosecution on the other.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*Petitioners in this case have demonstrated an injury in fact\nsufficient for Article III standing. We accordingly reverse the\njudgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth\nCircuit and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with\nthis opinion, including a determination whether the remaining\nArticle III standing requirements are met.It is so ordered.Notes1Section 3517.21(B) provides in\nrelevant part:2The dispute about the falsity of\nSBA\u2019s speech concerns two different provisions of the ACA: (1) the\nsubsidy to assist lower income individ-uals in paying insurance\npremiums, and (2) the direct appropriation of federal money for\ncertain health programs such as community health centers. See Brief\nfor Petitioners 4\u20135.3Petitioners also challenged a related\n\u201cdisclaimer provision,\u201d App. 126\u2013127, 156\u2013157, under Ohio Rev. Code\nAnn. \u00a73517.20, and COAST raised pre-emption and due process claims.\nReply Brief 21, n.\u00a07. Petitioners do not pursue their\n\u201cdisclaimer,\u201d pre-emption, or due process claims before us. We also\nneed not address SBA\u2019s separate challenge to the Commission\u2019s\ninvestigatory procedures; petitioners have conceded that the\nprocedures claim stands or falls with the substantive prohibition\non false statements. see Tr. of Oral Arg. 19. Finally, the parties\nagree that petitioners\u2019 as-applied claims \u201care better read as\nfacial objections to Ohio\u2019s law.\u201d Reply Brief 19. Accordingly, we\ndo not separately address the as-applied claims.4SBA named Driehaus, the Commission\u2019s\nmembers and its staff attorney (in their official capacities), and\nthe Ohio Secretary of State (in her official capacity) as\ndefendants. COAST named the Commission, the Commission\u2019s members\nand its staff attorney (in their official capacities), and the Ohio\nSecretary of State (in her official capacity) as defendants. All\nnamed defendants are respondents here.5The doctrines of standing and\nripeness \u201coriginate\u201d from the same Article III limitation. v. , .\nAs the parties acknowledge, the Article III standing and ripeness\nissues in this case \u201cboil down to the same question.\u201d v. , ,\nn.\u00a08 (2007); see Brief for Petitioners 28; Brief for\nRespondents 22. Consistent with our practice in cases like v. , ,\nand v. , n.\u00a011 (1979), we use the term \u201cstanding\u201d in this\nopinion.",
