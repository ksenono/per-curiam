    "text": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES_________________No. 18\u20131501_________________CHARLES C. LIU, et\u00a0al., PETITIONERSv.SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSIONon writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the ninth circuit[June 22, 2020]Justice Thomas, dissenting.The Court correctly declines to affirm the Ninth\nCircuit\u2019s decision upholding the District Court\u2019s disgorgement\norder, but I disagree with the Court\u2019s decision to vacate and\nremand for the lower courts to \u201climi[t]\u201d the disgorgement award.Ante,at 1. Disgorgement can never be awarded under 15\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a778u(d)(5). That statute authorizes the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to seek only \u201cequitable\nrelief that may be appropriate or necessary for the benefit of\ninvestors,\u201d and disgorgement is not a traditional equitable remedy.\nThus, I would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.IThe Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as\namended in 2005, allows the SEC to request \u201cequitable relief\u00a0\u201d\nin federal district court against those who violate federal\nsecurities laws. \u00a778u(d)(5). According to our usual interpretive\nconvention, \u201cequitable relief\u00a0\u201d refers to forms of equitable\nrelief available in the English Court of Chancery at the time of\nthe founding. Because disgorgement is a creation of the 20th\ncentury, it is not properly characterized as \u201cequitable relief,\u201d\nand, hence, the District Court was not authorized to award it under\n\u00a778u(d)(5).A\u201cThis Court has never treated general\nstatutory grants of equitable authority as giving federal courts a\nfreewheeling power to fashion new forms of equitable remedies.\u201dTrumpv.Hawaii, 585 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2018)\n(Thomas, J., concurring) (slip op., at 3). \u201cRather, it has read\nsuch statutes as constrained by \u2018the body of law which had been\ntransplanted to this country from the English Court of Chancery\u2019 in\n1789.\u201dIbid.(quotingGuaranty Trust Co.v.York,326 U.S.\n99, 105 (1945)). As Justice Story put it, \u201cthe settled doctrine\nof this court is, that the remedies in equity are to be\nadministered .\u00a0.\u00a0. according to the practice of courts of\nequity in [England], as contradistinguished from that of courts of\nlaw; subject, of course to the provisions of the acts of congress.\u201dBoylev.Zacharie & Turner, 6 Pet. 648, 654\n(1832).We have interpreted other statutes according to\nthis \u201csettled doctrine.\u201d For example, we have read the term\n\u201cequitable relief\u00a0\u201d in the Employee Retirement Income Security\nAct of 1974 to refer to \u201cthose categories of relief that were\ntypically available in equity.\u201dMertensv.Hewitt\nAssociates,508 U.S.\n248, 256 (1993) (emphasis deleted). We have done the same for\nthe Judiciary Act of 1789, see,e.g.,Grupo Mexicano de\nDesarrollo, S.\u00a0A.v.Alliance Bond Fund,Inc.,527 U.S.\n308, 318\u2013319 (1999), and for provisions in the Bankruptcy Code,\nseeTaggartv.Lorenzen, 587 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___\n(2019) (slip op., at 5). There is nothing about \u00a778u(d)(5) that\ncounsels departing from this approach.BDisgorgement is not a traditional form of\nequitable relief. Rather, cases, legal dictionaries, and treatises\nestablish that it is a 20th-century invention.As an initial matter, it is not even clear what\n\u201cdisgorgement\u201d means. The majority frankly acknowledges its\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018\u00a0\u201cprotean character.\u201d\u00a0\u2019\u00a0\u201dAnte, at 7\n(quotingPetrellav.Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Inc.,572 U.S.\n663, 688, n.\u00a01 (2014)). The difficulty of defining this\nsupposedly traditional remedy is the first sign that it is not a\nhistorically recognized equitable remedy. In contrast, an\naccounting for profits, or accounting\u2014a distinct form of relief\nthat the majority groups with disgorgement\u2014has a well-accepted\ndefinition: It compels a defendant to account for, and repay to a\nplaintiff, those profits that belong to the plaintiff in equity.\nBray, Fiduciary Remedies, in The Oxford Handbook of Fiduciary Law\n449 (E. Criddle, P. Miller, & R. Sitkoff eds. 2019). The\ndefinition of disgorgement, after today\u2019s decision, is a remedy\nthat compels each defendant to pay his profits (and sometimes,\nthough it is not clear when, all of his codefendants\u2019 profits) to a\nthird-party Government agency (which sometimes, though it is not\nclear when, passes the money on to victims). This remedy has no\nbasis in historical practice.No published case appears to have used the term\n\u201cdisgorgement\u201d to refer to equitable relief until the 20th century.\nEven then, the earliest cases use the word in a \u201cnon-technical\u201d\nsense, Brief for Law Professors asAmici Curiae22, to\ndescribe the action a defendant must take when a party is awarded a\ntraditional equitable remedy such as an accounting for profits or\nan equitable lien.[1] For\nexample, inByrdv.Mullinix, 159 Ark. 310, 251 S.W.\n871 (1923), the Supreme Court of Arkansas affirmed the imposition\nof an equitable lien to prevent a debtor from \u201cput[ting] the money\nin property which was itself beyond the reach of creditors, and to\ncompel its disgorgement,\u201did.,at 316\u2013317, 251 S.\u00a0W.,\nat 872. Likewise, inArmstrongv.Richards, 128 Fla.\n561, 175 So. 340 (1937), the Supreme Court of Florida referred to\n\u201cthe right of the taxpayer to require an accounting from and\ndisgorgement by public officers and those in collusion with them,\u201did., at 564, 175 So., at 341. In these cases, the term\n\u201cdisgorgement\u201d colloquially described what a defendant was ordered\nto do, not the remedy itself.By the 1960s, published opinions began to use\n\u201cdisgorgement\u201d to refer to a remedy in the administrative context.\nInNLRBv.Local 176, 276 F.2d 583 (CA1 1960), the\nagency had \u201capplied its .\u00a0.\u00a0. remedy of disgorgement of\ndues, requiring the union to refund to every member who had\nobtained employment on the Company project the dues which he had\npaid,\u201did., at 586 (footnote omitted). The court declined to\nenforce this part of the agency\u2019s order, but not because\ndisgorgement was an impermissible form of relief. Instead, it found\nthat, in the circumstances of the case, disgorgement \u201cseem[ed]\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. to be anex\u00a0post factopenalty.\u201dIbid.; see alsoNLRBv.Local 111, 278 F.2d\n823, 825 (CA1 1960) (enforcing a disgorgement order from the\nagency).By the 1970s, courts started using the term\n\u201cdisgorgement\u201d to describe a judicial remedy in its own right. When\nthe SEC initially sought this kind of relief under the Securities\nExchange Act inSECv.Texas Gulf Sulphur Co.,312 F. Supp. 77(SDNY 1970), the District Court called it\n\u201crestitution,\u201did.,at 93, and the Court of Appeals called\nit \u201c[r]estitution of [p]rofits,\u201dSECv.Texas Gulf\nSulphur Co., 446 F.2d 1301, 1307 (CA2 1971) (emphasis deleted).\nCourts soon substituted the label \u201cdisgorgement.\u201dSECv.Manor Nursing Centers,Inc., 458 F.2d 1082, 1105 (CA2\n1972);SECv.Shapiro,349 F. Supp. 46, 55 (SDNY 1972).The late date of these cases is sufficient\nreason to reject the argument that disgorgement is a traditional\nequitable remedy. But it is also telling that, when the SEC began\nseeking this relief, it did so without any statutory authority.\nPrior to 2005, the SEC lacked the power even to seek \u201cequitable\nrelief\u00a0\u201d in cases like this one. See \u00a7305(b), 116Stat. 779\n(amending the Securities Exchange Act). The District Court inTexas Gulf Sulphurpurported to \u201cimply [a] new remed[y],\u201d\nbased on its \u201cinherent equity power\u201d and a belief that \u201cthe\ncongressional purpose is effectuated by so doing.\u201d 312\nF.\u00a0Supp., at 91. But the sources it cited are dubious. The\ncourt relied onJ. I. Case Co.v.Borak,377 U.S.\n426(1964), a case about implied causes of action that we have\nsince abrogated. SeeAlexanderv.Sandoval,532 U.S.\n275, 287 (2001). It also relied on a securities law treatise\nthat advocated for what it called \u201crestitution\u201d but admitted that\ndistrict courts had no express authority to grant the remedy and\nthat the SEC had never sought this remedy in the past. 3 L. Loss,\nSecurities Regulation 1827\u20131828 (1961). It is functionally this\nsame unauthorized remedy that the SEC and courts now call\n\u201cdisgorgement.\u201d The details have varied over time, but the lineage\nis clear: Disgorgement is \u201ca relic of the heady days\u201d of courts\ninserting judicially created relief into statutes.Correctional\nServices Corp.v.Malesko,534 U.S.\n61, 75 (2001) (Scalia, J., concurring).Disgorgement as a remedy in its own right is\nalso absent from legal publications until the 20th century. Leading\nlegal dictionaries did not define the term until the turn of the\n20th century. See,e.g., Merriam-Webster\u2019s Dictionary of Law\n143 (1996); Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 480 (7th ed. 1999). Nor was\ndisgorgement included in the first Restatement of Restitution,\nadopted in 1936. The remedy does not appear until the Third\nRestatement, adopted in 2010, which states that \u201c[r]estitution\nremedies\u201d that seek \u201cto eliminate profit from wrongdoing\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. are often called \u2018disgorgement\u2019 or\n\u2018accounting.\u2019\u00a0\u201d 2 Restatement (Third) of Restitution and\nUnjust Enrichment \u00a751(4), p. 203. But \u201cRestatement\u201d is an inapt\ntitle for this edition of the treatise. Like many of the modern\nRestatements, its \u201cauthors have abandoned the mission of describing\nthe law, and have chosen instead to set forth their aspirations for\nwhat the law ought to be.\u201dKansasv.Nebraska,574 U.S.\n445, 475 (2015) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and dissenting\nin part). The inclusion of \u201cdisgorgement\u201d in the Third Restatement,\nwhich the majority cites in support of its holding,ante, at\n6, represents a \u201c\u00a0\u2018novel extension\u2019\u00a0\u201d of equity.Kansas,supra, at 483 (Thomas, J., concurring in part\nand dissenting in part) (quoting Roberts, Restitutionary\nDisgorgement for Opportunistic Breach of Contract and Mitigation of\nDamages, 42 Loyola (LA) L.\u00a0Rev. 131, 134 (2008)).I acknowledge that this Court has referred to\ndisgorgement as an equitable remedy in some of its prior decisions.\nSee,e.g.,Feltnerv.Columbia Pictures\nTelevision,Inc.,523 U.S.\n340, 352 (1998). But these opinions merely referred to the term\nin passing without considering the question in depth. The history\nis clear: Disgorgement is not a form of relief that was available\nin the English Court of Chancery at the time of the founding.CThe majority\u2019s treatment of disgorgement as an\nequitable remedy threatens great mischief. The term disgorgement\nitself invites abuse because it is a word with no fixed meaning.\nThe majority sees \u201cparallels\u201d between accounting and disgorgement,ante,at 2, n.\u00a01, but parallels are by definition not\nthe same. Even if they were, the traditional remedy of an\naccounting\u2014which compels a party to repay profits that belong to a\nplaintiff\u2014has important conceptual limitations that disgorgement\ndoes not. An accounting connotes the relationship between a\nplaintiff and a defendant. In the words of one scholar, \u201cit is an\naccounting by A to B.\u201d Bray, Fiduciary Remedies,at 454. But\ndisgorgement connotes no relationship and so is not naturally\nlimited to net profits and compensation of victims. It simply \u201cis A\ndisgorging.\u201dIbid.Further, the traditional remedy of a\nconstructive trust[2] or an\nequitable lien requires that the \u201cmoney or property identified as\nbelonging in good conscience to the plaintiff .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nclearly be traced to particular funds or property in the\ndefendant\u2019s possession.\u201dGreat-West Life & Annuity Ins.\nCo.v.Knudson,534 U.S.\n204, 213 (2002). Disgorgement reaches further because it has no\ntracing requirement. By using a word with no history in equity\njurisprudence, the SEC and courts have made it possible to\ncircumvent the careful limitations imposed on other equitable\nremedies.One need look no further than the SEC\u2019s use of\ndisgorgement to see the pitfalls of the majority\u2019s acquiescence in\nits continued use as a remedy. The order inTexas Gulf\nSulphurdid not depart too far from equitable principles. The\naward was limited to the defendants\u2019 net profits and the funds were\nheld in escrow and were at least partly available to compensate\nvictims, 446 F.\u00a02d, at 1307. It did not take long, however,\nfor a district court to order a defendant to turn over both his\nprofits and the investment \u201cincome earned on the proceeds.\u201dManor Nursing Centers, 458 F.\u00a02d, at 1105. And in the\ncase before us today, just a half century later, disgorgement has\nexpanded even further. The award is not limited to net profits or\neven money possessed by an individual defendant when it is imposed\njointly and severally. Seeante, at 5. And not only is it\nnot guaranteed to be used to compensate victims, but the imposition\nof over $26 million in disgorgement and approximately $8 million in\ncivil monetary penalties in this case seems to ensure that victims\nwill be unable to recover anything in their own actions. As long as\ncourts continue to award \u201cdisgorgement,\u201d both courts and the SEC\nwill continue to have license to expand their own power.The majority\u2019s decision to tame, rather than\nreject, disgorgement will also cause confusion in administrative\npractice. As the majority explains, the SEC is expressly authorized\nto impose \u201c\u00a0\u2018disgorgement\u2019\u00a0\u201d in its in-house tribunals.Ante, at 13 (quoting 15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a777h\u20131(e)). It is\nunclear whether the majority\u2019s new restrictions on disgorgement\nwill apply to these proceedings as well. If they do not, the result\nwill be that disgorgement has one meaning when the SEC goes to\ndistrict court and another when it proceeds in-house.More fundamentally, by failing to recognize that\nthe problem is disgorgement itself, the majority undermines our\nentire system of equity. The majority believes that insistence on\nthe traditional rules of equity is unnecessarily formalistic,ante,at 3, n.\u00a01, but the Founders accepted federal\nequitable powers only because those powers depended on traditional\nforms. The Constitution was ratified on the understanding that\nequity was \u201ca precise legal system\u201d with \u201cspecific equitable\nremed[ies].\u201dMissouriv.Jenkins,515 U.S.\n70, 127 (1995) (Thomas, J., concurring). \u201cAlthough courts of\nequity exercised remedial \u2018discretion,\u2019 that discretion allowed\nthem to deny or tailor a remedy despite a demonstrated violation of\na right, not to expand a remedy beyond its traditional scope.\u201dTrump, 585 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (Thomas, J., concurring) (slip\nop., at 5). The majority, while imposing some limits, ultimately\npermits courts to continue expanding equitable remedies. I would\nsimply hold that the phrase \u201cequitable relief\u00a0\u201d in \u00a778u(d)(5)\ndoes not authorize disgorgement.IIAfter holding that disgorgement is equitable\nrelief, the majority remands for the lower courts to reconsider the\ndisgorgement order in this case. If the majority is going to accept\n\u201cdisgorgement\u201d as an available remedy, it should at least limit the\norder to be consistent with the traditional rules of equity. First,\nthe order should be limited to each petitioner\u2019s profits. Second,\nthe order should not be imposed jointly and severally. Third, the\nmoney paid by petitioners should be used to compensate petitioners\u2019\nvictims.AFirst, the disgorgement order should be\nlimited to \u201cthe profits actually made\u201d by each petitioner.Mowryv.Whitney, 14 Wall. 620, 649 (1872); see alsoante, at 11, 18\u201320. Defendants in equity traditionally may\ndeduct \u201callowances .\u00a0.\u00a0. for the cost and expense of the\nbusiness\u201d from the amount of the award.Rootv.Railway\nCo.,105 U.S.\n189, 215 (1882); see alsoCallaghanv.Myers,128 U.S.\n617, 665 (1888);Elizabethv.Pavement Co.,97 U.S.\n126, 139 (1878);Rubber Co.v.Goodyear, 9 Wall.\n788, 804 (1870). The rationale behind this rule is that \u201cit is not\nthe function of courts of equity to administer punishment.\u201dBangor Punta Operations,Inc.v.Bangor &\nAroostook R. Co.,417 U.S.\n703, 717\u2013718, n.\u00a014 (1974) (internal quotation marks\nomitted); see also 2 J. Story, Commentaries on Equity Jurisprudence\n\u00a71494, p.\u00a0819 (13th ed. 1886). Here, however, the District\nCourt reasoned that \u201cit would be \u2018unjust to permit the defendants\nto offset against the investor dollars they received the expenses\nof running the very business they created to defraud those\ninvestors into giving the defendants the money in the first\nplace.\u2019\u00a0\u201d 754 Fed.\u00a0Appx. 505, 509 (CA9 2018) (quotingSECv.J.\u00a0T. Wallenbrock & Assocs.,440 F.3d 1109, 1114 (CA9 2006)). On remand, the lower courts\nshould limit the award to each petitioner\u2019s profits.BSecond, and relatedly, the disgorgement order\nshould not be imposed jointly and severally. The majority\nanalogizes disgorgement to accounting,ante, at 6, but this\nCourt has rejected joint and several liability in actions for an\naccounting.Elizabeth,supra,at 139\u2013140;Keystone\nMfg. Co.v.Adams,151 U.S.\n139, 148 (1894);Belknapv.Schild,161 U.S.\n10, 25\u201326 (1896). The majority instructs the lower courts to\ndetermine whether petitioners were \u201cpartners in wrongdoing,\u201d\napparently based on a case about the liability of partners.Ante,at 10, 18 (citingAmblerv.Whipple, 20\nWall. 546 (1874)). But the liability in that case was premised on\nthe law of partnership, and nothing indicates that petitioners here\nwere legal partners. The joint and several order in this case is\nthus at odds with traditional equitable rules.[3]CFinally, the award should be used to\ncompensate victims, not to enrich the Government. Plaintiffs in\nequity may claim \u201cthat which,ex aequo et bono[according to\nwhat is equitable and good], is theirs, and nothing beyond this.\u201dLivingstonv.Woodworth, 15 How. 546, 560 (1854). The\nmoney ordered to be paid as disgorgement in no sense belongs to the\nGovernment, and the majority cites no authority allowing a\nGovernment agency to keep equitable relief for a wrong done to a\nthird party. Requiring the SEC to only \u201cgenerally\u201d compensate\nvictims,ante,at 15, is inconsistent with traditional\nequitable principles.Worse still from a practical standpoint, the\nmajority provides almost no guidance to the lower courts about how\nto resolve this question on remand. Even assuming that disgorgement\nis \u201cequitable relief\u201d for purposes of \u00a778u(d)(5) and that the\nGovernment may sometimes keep the money, the Court should at least\ndo more to identify the circumstances in which the Government may\nkeep the money. Instead, the Court asks lower courts to improvise a\nsolution. If past is prologue, this uncertainty is sure to create\nopportunities for the SEC to continue exercising unlawful\npower.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*I would reverse for the straightforward reason\nthat disgorgement is not \u201cequitable relief\u00a0\u201d within the\nmeaning of \u00a778u(d)(5). Because the majority acquiesces in the\ncontinued use of disgorgement under that statute, I respectfully\ndissent.Notes1An equitable lien is\nimposed on a defendant\u2019s property \u201cas security for a claim on the\nground that otherwise the former would be unjustly enriched.\u201d\nRestatement of Restitution \u00a7161, p. 650 (1936).2A constructive trust\ncompels a defendant \u201cholding title to property .\u00a0.\u00a0. to\nconvey it to another on the ground that he would be unjustly\nenriched if he were permitted to retain it.\u201d Restatement of\nRestitution \u00a7160, at 640\u2013641.3For its part, respondent\ncites the joint and several liability inJacksonv.Smith,254 U.S.\n586, 589 (1921), but the remedy in that case was a constructive\ntrust, seeSmithv.Jackson, 48 App. D.\u00a0C. 565,\n576 (1919). As explained above, there is no tracing requirement in\nthe District Court\u2019s order as would be required in a case of\nconstructive trust.Supra, at 6\u20137. The Court also allowed\njoint and several liability inBelfordv.Scribner,144 U.S.\n488(1892), a copyright case. But it based its holding on the\nfact that, under the relevant copyright statute, \u201cboth the printer\nand the publisher are equally liable to the owner of the copyright\nfor an infringement.\u201dId., at 507; see alsoWashingtonian\nPublishing Co.v.Pearson, 140 F.2d 465, 467 (CADC\n1944).",
