    "text": "OPINION OF THE COURTBEARD V. KINDLER558 U. S. ____ (2009)SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESNO. 08-992JEFFREY A. BEARD, SECRETARY, PENNSYLVANIA\nDEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS, et al., PETITIONERSv.JOSEPH\nJ. KINDLERon writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the third circuit[December 8, 2009]Chief Justice Roberts delivered\nthe opinion of the Court.A federal habeas court will not\nreview a claim rejected by a state court \u201cif the decision of [the\nstate] court rests on a state law ground that is independent of the\nfederal question and adequate to support the judgment.\u201dColemanv.Thompson,501 U. S. 722, 729\n(1991). We granted certiorari to decide the following question: \u201cIs\na state procedural rule automatically \u2018inadequate\u2019 under the\nadequate-state-grounds doctrine\u2014and therefore unenforceable on\nfederal habeas corpus review\u2014because the state rule is\ndiscretionary rather than mandatory?\u201d Pet. for Cert. i. Petitioners\nargue the correct answer is \u201cno.\u201d At oral argument,\nrespondent\u2014consistent with his position below\u2014expressly agreed. We\ndo too, and accordingly vacate the judgment of the Court of\nAppeals.IIn 1982, Joseph Kindler, along\nwith Scott Shaw and David Bernstein, burglarized a music store in\nBucks County, Pennsylvania. Police stopped the getaway car and\narrested Shaw and Bernstein. In a harbinger of things to come,\nKindler escaped.Commonwealthv.Kindler, 536 Pa.\n228, 236, 639 A.\u00a02d 1, 5, cert. denied,513 U. S. 933(1994).Police later arrested Kindler and\ncharged him with burglary. He was released on bail. Bernstein\nagreed to testify against Kindler, but Kindler had other plans. At\nabout 2:30 a.m. on July 25, 1982, Kindler and Shaw attacked\nBernstein outside his apartment. Kindler beat Bernstein with a\nbaseball bat approximately 20 times, and Shaw shocked Bernstein 5\ntimes with an electric prod. Bernstein at that point was still\nalive but unable to move, and Kindler and Shaw dragged their victim\nto their nearby car, loaded him in the trunk, and drove to the\nDelaware River. At the river, Kindler tied a cinder block around\nBernstein\u2019s neck and dumped him in the water. A forensic examiner\nlater determined that Bernstein died of drowning and massive head\ninjuries. 536 Pa., at 236\u2013239, 639 A.\u00a02d,at 5\u20136.Kindler was brought to trial and convicted of\ncapital murder. The jury recommended a death sentence, and Kindler\nfiled postverdict motions.Id., at 230\u2013231, 639\nA.\u00a02d, at 2.But on September 19, 1984, before the trial\ncourt could consider the motions or the jury\u2019s death\nrecommendation, Kindler escaped.Ibid. In an organized\neffort to saw through the external prison bars with smuggled tools,\nKindler broke out of the maximum-security wing of the prison and\nheaded for Canada. SeeCommonwealthv.Kindler,\n554 Pa. 513, 517\u2013518, and n.\u00a04, 722 A.\u00a02d 143, 145, and\nn.\u00a04 (1998).Kindler remained a fugitive in Canada until\nApril 26, 1985, when he was arrested in Quebec for separate\nburglary offenses. The United States sought Kindler\u2019s return, but\nan extradition treaty allowed Canada to refuse to hand over anyone\nlikely to face execution. SeeKindlerv.Canada\n(Minister of Justice), [1991] 2 S. C. R. 779.Kindler turned into something of a local\ncelebrity. He even appeared on Canadian television, explaining,\namong other things, how he had escaped and why he chose Canada: \u201cI\nknew there was no death penalty here.\u201d CTV National News: Joseph\nKindler\u2019s Fate Unresolved (Canadian television broadcast Sept. 22,\n1985) (videos available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file). Canadian\nauthorities ultimately acquiesced to overtures from the United\nStates and agreed to extradite Kindler.Kindler,supra, at 231, 639 A.\u00a02d, at 2.But before Kindler could be transferred from\nCanadian custody, he escaped again. On the night of October 23,\n1986, Kindler broke through a skylight on the 13th floor of the\njail (his fellow inmates had hoisted him up to the skylight 15 feet\nabove the floor) and escaped to the roof, where he stood 175 feet\nabove ground. Armed with 13 stories\u2019 worth of bedsheets tied\ntogether, Kindler safely rappelled down the side of the jail. (A\nfellow escapee was not as lucky\u2014the sheets ripped on his way down,\ncausing him to fall 50 feet to his death.)Kindler, 554\nPa., at 517\u2013519, 722 A.\u00a02d, at 145.This time, Kindler remained on the lam for\nmore than two years, until he was featured on the popular\ntelevision show, \u201cAmerica\u2019s Most Wanted.\u201d Characterizing Kindler as\n\u201can above average criminal\u201d and \u201ca chess player who understands\nwhen to make his move,\u201d the show asked viewers for information to\nhelp capture him.America\u2019s Most Wanted, Sept. 4, 1988,\nSeason 1, Episode 30, at 10:01. Several viewers recognized Kindler\nand notified Canadian authorities, who arrested him in September\n1988. 554 Pa., at 519, 722 A.\u00a02d, at 145.Kindler again fought extradition. On September\n16, 1991, after three years of litigation, the Supreme Court of\nCanada rejected Kindler\u2019s efforts. SeeKindler, 2 S. C. R.\n779. That same day, Canadian officials extradited Kindler to the\nUnited States.Kindlerv.Horn, 291 F.\u00a0Supp.\n2d 323, 334 (ED Pa. 2003).In the meantime, in 1984, the Pennsylvania\ntrial court had dismissed Kindler\u2019s postverdict motions because of\nhis original escape. Once back in the United States, Kindler filed\na motion to reinstate those challenges to his conviction and\nsentence. The trial court denied the reinstatement motion, holding\nthat the trial court judge who had dismissed the postverdict\nmotions in 1984 had not abused his discretion. In October 1991\u2014more\nthan seven years after the jury\u2019s death recommendation\u2014the court\nformally imposed the death sentence.Commonwealthv.Kindler, No. 2747 etc. (Pa. Ct. Common Pleas, Feb. 28,\n1992), App. 66\u201370.Kindler appealed, arguing that the trial court\nerred in declining to address the merits of his postverdict\nmotions. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court affirmed.Kindler,\n536 Pa., at 232\u2013234, 639 A.\u00a02d, at 3. That court recognized\nthat \u201ctrial courts, when faced with a defendant in fugitive status,\n. . . have every right to fashion an appropriate response[,] which\ncan include the dismissal of pending post-verdict motions.\u201dId.,at 233, 639 A.\u00a02d, at 3. The court then\ndetermined that the trial court\u2019s decision to dismiss Kindler\u2019s\nclaims fell within its authority: The \u201cdismiss[al] [of] the\npost-verdict motions was a reasonable response to Appellant\u2019s\n\u2018flouting\u2019 of the authority of the court.\u201dId.,at\n233\u2013234, 639 A.\u00a02d, at 3. Under Pennsylvania\u2019s fugitive\nforfeiture law, the court concluded, Kindler\u2019s case therefore came\nto it \u201cwithout any allegations of error (direct or collateral)\npreserved.\u201dId., at 234, 639 A.\u00a02d, at 4.The Pennsylvania Supreme Court nonetheless\nconducted the \u201climited review\u201d mandated for death sentences under\nPennsylvania law. Under that review, the court was required to\nconfirm that the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction\nof first-degree murder and at least one aggravating factor, and\nthat the sentence was not excessive, disproportionate, or the\nproduct of passion or prejudice.Id.,at 234\u2013235, 639\nA.\u00a02d, at 4. Satisfied that Kindler\u2019s conviction met these\nstandards, the court affirmed his conviction and sentence. We\ndenied certiorari.Kindlerv.Pennsylvania,513 U. S. 933(1994).On state habeas, the Court of Common Pleas\nrejected Kindler\u2019s claims. That court held that the Pennsylvania\nSupreme Court had already ruled that Kindler\u2019s escape forfeited all\nclaims challenging his conviction and sentence that Kindler may\nonce have been entitled to bring.Commonwealthv.Kindler, No. 2747 etc. (July 23, 1997), App. 183, 187\u2013188.\nThe Pennsylvania Supreme Court affirmed.Kindler, 554 Pa.,\nat 514, 722 A.\u00a02d, at 143.Kindler then sought federal habeas relief. The\nDistrict Court determined that the fugitive forfeiture rule did not\nprovide an adequate basis to bar federal review of Kindler\u2019s habeas\nclaims. 291 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d, at 340\u2013343. The District Court then\nproceeded to address the merits, granting Kindler\u2019s petition on the\ngrounds that he was sentenced based on jury instructions that were\nunconstitutional underMillsv.Maryland,486 U. S. 367(1988), and that the prosecutor improperly introduced an\naggravating factor at sentencing. 291 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d, at 346\u2013351,\n357\u2013358. The court rejected Kindler\u2019s ineffective assistance of\ncounsel claim.Id., at 356.The Third Circuit affirmed. That court began\nby recognizing that \u201c[a] procedural rule that is consistently\napplied in the vast majority of cases is adequate to bar federal\nhabeas review even if state courts are willing to occasionally\noverlook it and review the merits of a claim for relief where the\nrule would otherwise apply.\u201dKindlerv.Horn, 542\nF.\u00a03d 70, 79 (2008). The Court of Appeals then considered the\nPennsylvania fugitive forfeiture rule in place at the time of\nKindler\u2019s first escape: \u201cPennsylvania courts had discretion to hear\nan appeal filed by a fugitive who had been returned to custody\nbefore an appeal was initiated or dismissed\u2026\u00a0. Accordingly,\nthe fugitive forfeiture rule was not \u2018firmly established\u2019 and\ntherefore was not an independent and adequate procedural rule\nsufficient to bar review of the merits of a habeas petition in\nfederal court.\u201dIbid. (citingDoctorv.Walters, 96 F.\u00a03d 675, 684\u2013686 (CA3 1996)). The court\nthus determined that \u201cthe state trial court still had discretion to\nreinstate his post-verdict motions. Accordingly, we conclude that,\nunderDoctor, Pennsylvania\u2019s fugitive waiver law did not\npreclude the district court from reviewing the merits of the claims\nraised in Kindler\u2019s habeas petition.\u201d 542 F.\u00a03d, at 80.\nTurning to the merits, the Court of Appeals disagreed with the\nDistrict Court on the improper aggravating factor claim, but held\nthat Kindler was entitled to relief based on hisMillsand\nineffective assistance of counsel claims. 542 F.\u00a03d,at 80\u201387.The Commonwealth petitioned for certiorari,\narguing that the Court of Appeals\u2019 determination that state\ndiscretionary rules are automatically inadequate conflicted with\nthe holdings of other Courts of Appeals and warranted this Court\u2019s\nreview. Pet. for Cert. 6\u201311. Kindler countered that the\nCommonwealth had mischaracterized the Third Circuit\u2019s holding.\nRelying on the court\u2019s citation of theDoctoropinion,\nKindler argued that the Third Circuit did not hold that\ndiscretionary state rules are automatically inadequate; rather the\ncourt determined that the state courts applied \u201canewanddifferentrule from that in existence at the time of the\nalleged default.\u201d Brief in Opposition 3. It was that new rule,\nKindler maintained, that the Third Circuit found inadequate.Ibid.We granted the Commonwealth\u2019s petition for\ncertiorari. 556 U. S. ___ (2009). That petition asks us to decide\nwhether discretionary procedural rulings are automatically\ninadequate to bar federal court review on habeas.IIThe question whether a state\nprocedural ruling is adequate is itself a question of federal law.Leev.Kemna,534 U. S. 362, 375\n(2002). We have framed the adequacy inquiry by asking whether the\nstate rule in question was \u201c\u00a0\u2018firmly established and regularly\nfollowed.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId., at 376 (quotingJamesv.Kentucky,466 U. S. 341, 348\n(1984)).We hold that a discretionary\nstate procedural rule can serve as an adequate ground to bar\nfederal habeas review. Nothing inherent in such a rule renders it\ninadequate for purposes of the adequate state ground doctrine. To\nthe contrary, a discretionary rule can be \u201cfirmly established\u201d and\n\u201cregularly followed\u201d\u2014even if the appropriate exercise of discretion\nmay permit consideration of a federal claim in some cases but not\nothers. See Meltzer, State Court Forfeitures of Federal Rights, 99\nHarv. L.\u00a0Rev. 1128, 1140 (1986) (\u201c[R]efusals to exercise\ndiscretion do not form an important independent category under the\ninadequate state ground doctrine\u201d).A contrary holding would pose an unnecessary\ndilemma for the States: States could preserve flexibility by\ngranting courts discretion to excuse procedural errors, but only at\nthe cost of undermining the finality of state court judgments. Or\nStates could preserve the finality of their judgments by\nwithholding such discretion, but only at the cost of precluding any\nflexibility in applying the rules.We are told that, if forced to choose, many\nStates would opt for mandatory rules to avoid the high costs that\ncome with plenary federal review. See,e.g., Brief for\nState of California et\u00a0al. asAmici Curiae19; Brief\nfor Criminal Justice Legal Foundation asAmicus Curiae14.\nThat would be unfortunate in many cases, as discretionary rules are\noften desirable. In some circumstances, for example, the factors\nfacing trial courts \u201care so numerous, variable and subtle that the\nfashioning of rigid rules would be more likely to impair [the trial\njudge\u2019s] ability to deal fairly with a particular problem than to\nlead to a just result.\u201dUnited Statesv.McCoy,\n517 F.\u00a02d 41, 44 (CA7) (Stevens, J.), cert. denied,423 U. S. 895(1975);\nsee also Friendly, Indiscretion About Discretion, 31 Emory\nL.\u00a0J. 747, 760\u2013761 (1982). The result would be particularly\nunfortunate for criminal defendants, who would lose the opportunity\nto argue that a procedural default should be excused through the\nexercise of judicial discretion. SeeHenryv.Mississippi,379 U. S. 443, 463,\nn.\u00a03 (1965) (Harlan, J., dissenting) (\u201cIf, in order to\ninsulate its decisions from reversal by this Court, a state court\nmust strip itself of the discretionary power to differentiate\nbetween different sets of circumstances, the [adequate state\nground] rule operates in a most perverse way\u201d).It is perhaps unsurprising, then, that the\nfederal system often grants broad discretion to the trial judge\nwhen his ringside perspective at the \u201c\u00a0\u2018main event\u2019\u00a0\u201d\noffers him a comparative advantage in decisionmaking.Wainwrightv.Sykes,433 U. S. 72, 90 (1977);\ncf.United Statesv.Poynter, 495 F.\u00a03d 349,\n351\u2013352 (CA6 2007). The States seem to value discretionary rules as\nmuch as the Federal Government does. See Brief for State of\nCalifornia et\u00a0al. asAmici Curiae16\u201317 (citing\nvarious state discretionary procedural rules). In light of the\nfederalism and comity concerns that motivate the adequate state\nground doctrine in the habeas context, seeColeman, 501 U.\nS., at 730, it would seem particularly strange to disregard state\nprocedural rules that are substantially similar to those to which\nwe give full force in our own courts. Cf.Francisv.Henderson,425 U. S. 536, 541\u2013542\n(1976). Even stranger to do so with respect to rules in place in\nnearly every State, and all at one fell swoop.We take our holding in this case to be\nuncontroversial\u2014so uncontroversial, in fact, that both parties\nagreed to the point before this Court. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 29\u201331.\nRather than defending the question on which we granted\ncertiorari\u2014whether discretionary rules are automatically\ninadequate\u2014Kindler argues that the Pennsylvania courts did not\napply a discretionary rule at all, but instead applied a new rule\nmandating dismissal. Such a mandatory dismissal, Kindler contends,\nconstituted a break from past discretionary practice, and thus does\nnot provide an adequate state ground to bar his federal claims. We\nleave it to the Court of Appeals to address that argument, and any\nothers Kindler may have preserved, on remand.For its part, the Commonwealth urges us not\nonly to reject aperserule about discretionary\nrulings, but also to undertake \u201c[a] new effort to state a standard\nfor inadequacy.\u201d Brief for Petitioners 25.Amicisupporting the Commonwealth join in that request. See Brief for\nCriminal Justice Legal Foundation asAmicus Curiae6\u201310.\nWe decline that invitation as well. The procedural default at issue\nhere\u2014escape from prison\u2014is hardly a typical procedural default,\nmaking this case an unsuitable vehicle for providing broad guidance\non the adequate state ground doctrine.If our holding in this case is narrow, it is\nbecause the question we granted certiorari to decide is narrow.\nAnswering that question is sufficient unto the day.The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the\nThird Circuit is vacated, and the case is remanded for further\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.Justice Alito took no part in the\nconsideration or decision of this case.",
