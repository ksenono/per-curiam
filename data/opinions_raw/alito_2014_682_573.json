We\nhold that the regulations that impose this obligation violate RFRA,\nwhich prohibits the Federal Government from taking any action that\nsubstantially burdens the exercise of religion unless that action\nconstitutes the least restrictive means of serving a compelling\ngovernment interest.In holding that the HHS\nmandate is unlawful, we reject HHS\u2019s argument that the owners of\nthe companies for-feited all RFRA protection when they decided to\norganize their businesses as corporations rather than sole\nproprietorships or general partnerships. The plain terms of RFRA\nmake it perfectly clear that Congress did not discriminate in this\nway against men and women who wish to run their businesses as\nfor-profit corporations in the manner required by their religious\nbeliefs.Since RFRA applies in\nthese cases, we must decide whether the challenged HHS regulations\nsubstantially burden the exercise of religion, and we hold that\nthey do. The owners of the businesses have religious objections to\nabortion, and according to their religious beliefs the four\ncontraceptive methods at issue are abortifacients. If the owners\ncomply with the HHS mandate, they believe they will be facilitating\nabortions, and if they do not comply, they will pay a very heavy\nprice\u2014as much as $1.3 million per day, or about $475 million per\nyear, in the case of one of the companies. If these consequences do\nnot amount to a substantial burden, it is hard to see what\nwould.Under RFRA, a\nGovernment action that imposes a substantial burden on religious\nexercise must serve a compelling government interest, and we assume\nthat the HHS regulations satisfy this requirement. But in order for\nthe HHS mandate to be sustained, it must also constitute the least\nrestrictive means of serving that interest, and the mandate plainly\nfails that test. There are other ways in which Congress or HHS\ncould equally ensure that every woman has cost-free access to the\nparticular contraceptives at issue here and, indeed, to all\nFDA-approved contraceptives.In fact, HHS has\nalready devised and implemented a system that seeks to respect the\nreligious liberty of religious nonprofit corporations while\nensuring that the employees of these entities have precisely the\nsame access to all FDA-approved contraceptives as employees of\ncompanies whose owners have no religious objections to providing\nsuch coverage. The employees of these religious nonprofit\ncorporations still have access to insurance coverage without cost\nsharing for all FDA-approved contracep-tives; and according to HHS,\nthis system imposes no net economic burden on the insurance\ncompanies that are required to provide or secure the coverage.Although HHS has made\nthis system available to religious nonprofits that have religious\nobjections to the contraceptive mandate, HHS has provided no reason\nwhy the same system cannot be made available when the owners of\nfor-profit corporations have similar religious objections. We\ntherefore conclude that this system constitutes an alternative that\nachieves all of the Government\u2019s aims while providing greater\nrespect for religious liberty. And under RFRA, that conclusion\nmeans that enforcement of the HHS contraceptive mandate against the\nobjecting parties in these cases is unlawful.As this description of\nour reasoning shows, our holding is very specific. We do not hold,\nas the principal dissent alleges, that for-profit corporations and\nother commercial enterprises can \u201copt out of any law (saving only\ntax laws) they judge incompatible with their sincerely held\nreligious beliefs.\u201d Post, at 1 (opinion of Ginsburg, J.). Nor do we\nhold, as the dissent implies, that such corporations have free rein\nto take steps that impose \u201cdisadvantages .\u00a0.\u00a0. on others\u201d\nor that require \u201cthe general public [to] pick up the tab.\u201d Post, at\n1\u20132. And we certainly do not hold or suggest that \u201cRFRA demands\naccommodation of a for-profit corporation\u2019s religious beliefs no\nmatter the impact that accommodation may have on .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nthousands of women employed by Hobby Lobby.\u201d Post, at 2.[1] The effect of the HHS-created\naccommodation on the women employed by Hobby Lobby and the other\ncompanies involved in these cases would be precisely zero. Under\nthat accommodation, these women would still be entitled to all\nFDA-approved contraceptives without cost sharing.IACongress enacted RFRA\nin 1993 in order to provide very broad protection for religious\nliberty. RFRA\u2019s enactment came three years after this Court\u2019s\ndecision in Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore. v.\nSmith, 494 U.\u00a0S. 872 (1990) , which largely repudiated the\nmethod of analyzing free-exercise claims that had been used in\ncases like Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0398 (1963), and\nWisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.\u00a0S. 205 (1972) . In determining\nwhether challenged government actions violated the Free Exercise\nClause of the First Amendment, those decisions used a balancing\ntest that took into account whether the challenged action imposed a\nsubstantial burden on the practice of religion, and if it did,\nwhether it was needed to serve a compelling government interest.\nApplying this test, the Court held in Sherbert that an employee who\nwas fired for refusing to work on her Sabbath could not be denied\nunemployment benefits. 374 U.\u00a0S., at 408\u2013409. And in Yoder,\nthe Court held that Amish children could not be required to comply\nwith a state law demanding that they remain in school until the age\nof 16 even though their religion required them to focus on uniquely\nAmish values and beliefs during their formative adolescent years.\n406 U.\u00a0S., at 210\u2013211, 234\u2013236.In Smith, however, the\nCourt rejected \u201cthe balancing test set forth in Sherbert.\u201d 494\nU.\u00a0S., at 883. Smith concerned two members of the Native\nAmerican Church who were fired for ingesting peyote for sacramental\npurposes. When they sought unemployment benefits, the State of\nOregon rejected their claims on the ground that consumption of\npeyote was a crime, but the Oregon Supreme Court, applying the\nSherbert test, held that the denial of benefits violated the Free\nExercise Clause. 494 U.\u00a0S., at 875.This Court then\nreversed, observing that use of the Sherbert test whenever a person\nobjected on religious grounds to the enforcement of a generally\napplicable law \u201cwould open the prospect of constitutionally\nrequired religious exemptions from civic obligations of almost\nevery conceivable kind.\u201d 494 U.\u00a0S., at 888. The Court\ntherefore held that, under the First Amendment, \u201cneutral, generally\napplicable laws may be applied to religious practices even when not\nsupported by a compelling governmental interest.\u201d City of Boerne v.\nFlores, 521\u00a0U.\u00a0S. 507, 514 (1997).Congress responded to\nSmith by enacting RFRA. \u201c[L]aws [that are] \u2018neutral\u2019 toward\nreligion,\u201d Congress found, \u201cmay burden religious exercise as surely\nas laws intended to interfere with religious exercise.\u201d\n42\u00a0U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72000bb(a)(2); see also \u00a72000bb(a)(4).\nIn order to ensure broad protection for religious liberty, RFRA\nprovides that \u201cGovernment shall not substantially burden a person\u2019s\nexercise of religion even if the burden results from a rule of\ngeneral applicability.\u201d \u00a72000bb\u20131(a).[2] If the Government substantially burdens a person\u2019s\nexercise of religion, under the Act that person is entitled to an\nexemption from the rule unless the Government \u201cdemonstrates that\napplication of the burden to the person\u2014(1) is in furtherance of a\ncompelling governmental interest; and (2) is the least restrictive\nmeans of furthering that compelling governmental interest.\u201d\n\u00a72000bb\u20131(b).[3]As enacted in 1993,\nRFRA applied to both the Federal Government and the States, but the\nconstitutional authority invoked for regulating federal and state\nagencies differed. As applied to a federal agency, RFRA is based on\nthe enumerated power that supports the particular agency\u2019s\nwork,[4] but in attempting to\nregulate the States and their subdivisions, Congress relied on its\npower under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to enforce the\nFirst Amendment. 521 U.\u00a0S., at 516\u2013517. In City of Boerne,\nhowever, we held that Congress had overstepped its Section 5\nauthority because \u201c[t]he stringent test RFRA demands\u201d \u201cfar\nexceed[ed] any pattern or practice of unconstitutional conduct\nunder the Free Exercise Clause as interpreted in Smith.\u201d Id., at\n533\u2013534. See also id., at 532.Following our decision\nin City of Boerne, Congress passed the Religious Land Use and\nInstitutionalized Persons Act of 2000 (RLUIPA), 114Stat. 803, 42\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72000cc et seq. That statute, enacted under\nCongress\u2019s Commerce and Spending Clause powers, imposes the same\ngeneral test as RFRA but on a more limited category of governmental\nactions. See Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U.\u00a0S. 709 \u2013716 (2005).\nAnd, what is most relevant for present purposes, RLUIPA amended\nRFRA\u2019s definition of the \u201cexercise of religion.\u201d See \u00a72000bb\u20132(4)\n(importing RLUIPA definition). Before RLUIPA, RFRA\u2019s definition\nmade reference to the First Amendment. See \u00a72000bb\u20132(4) (1994 ed.)\n(defining \u201cexercise of religion\u201d as \u201cthe exercise of religion under\nthe First Amendment\u201d). In RLUIPA, in an obvious effort to effect a\ncomplete separation from First Amendment case law, Congress deleted\nthe reference to the First Amendment and defined the \u201cexercise of\nreligion\u201d to include \u201cany exercise of religion, whether or not\ncompelled by, or central to, a system of religious belief.\u201d\n\u00a72000cc\u20135(7)(A). And Congress mandated that this concept \u201cbe\nconstrued in favor of a broad protection of religious exercise, to\nthe maximum extent permitted by the terms of this chapter and the\nConstitution.\u201d \u00a72000cc\u20133(g).[5]BAt issue in these\ncases are HHS regulations promul-gated under the Patient Protection\nand Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA), 124Stat. 119. ACA generally\nrequires employers with 50 or more full-time employees to offer\u201ca\ngroup health plan or group health insurance coverage\u201d that provides\n\u201cminimum essential coverage.\u201d 26 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a75000A(f)(2);\n\u00a7\u00a74980H(a), (c)(2). Any covered employer that does not provide such\ncoverage must pay a substantial price. Specifically, if a covered\nemployer provides group health insurance but its plan fails to\ncomply with ACA\u2019s group-health-plan requirements, the employer may\nbe required to pay $100 per day for each affected \u201cindividual.\u201d\n\u00a7\u00a74980D(a)\u2013(b). And if the employer decides to stop providing\nhealth insurance altogether and at least one full-time employee\nenrolls in a health plan and qualifies for a subsidy on one of the\ngovernment-run ACA exchanges, the employer must pay $2,000 per year\nfor each of its full-time employees. \u00a7\u00a74980H(a), (c)(1).Unless an exception\napplies, ACA requires an employer\u2019s group health plan or\ngroup-health-insurance coverage to furnish \u201cpreventive care and\nscreenings\u201d for women without \u201cany cost sharing requirements.\u201d 42\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7300gg\u201313(a)(4). Congress itself, however, did\nnot specify what types of preventive care must be covered. Instead,\nCongress authorized the Health Resources and Services\nAdministration (HRSA), a component of HHS, to make that important\nand sensitive decision. Ibid. The HRSA in turn consulted the\nInstitute of Medicine, a nonprofit group of volunteer advisers, in\ndetermining which preventive services to require. See 77 Fed. Reg.\n8725\u20138726 (2012).In August 2011, based\non the Institute\u2019s recommendations, the HRSA promulgated the\nWomen\u2019s Preventive Services Guidelines. See id., at 8725\u20138726, and\nn. 1; online at http://hrsa.gov/womensguidelines (all Internet\nmaterials as visited June 26, 2014, and available in Clerk of\nCourt\u2019s case file). The Guidelines provide that nonexempt employers\nare generally required to provide \u201ccoverage, without cost sharing\u201d\nfor \u201c[a]ll Food and Drug Ad-ministration [(FDA)] approved\ncontraceptive methods, sterilization procedures, and patient\neducation and counseling.\u201d 77 Fed.\u00a0Reg. 8725 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). Although many of the required,\nFDA-approved methods of contraception work by preventing the\nfertilization of an egg, four of those methods (those specifically\nat issue in these cases) may have the effect of preventing an\nalready fertilized egg from developing any further by inhibiting\nits attachment to the uterus. See Brief for HHS in No. 13\u2013354, pp.\n9\u201310, n.\u00a04;[6] FDA, Birth\nControl: Medicines to Help You.[7]HHS also authorized the\nHRSA to establish exemptions from the contraceptive mandate for\n\u201creligious employers.\u201d 45 CFR \u00a7147.131(a). That category\nencompasses \u201cchurches, their integrated auxiliaries, and\nconventions or associ-ations of churches,\u201d as well as \u201cthe\nexclusively religious activities of any religious order.\u201d See ibid\n(citing 26 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a76033(a)(3)(A)(i), (iii)). In its\nGuidelines,HRSA exempted these organizations from the requirement\nto cover contraceptive services. See\nhttp://hrsa.gov/womensguidelines.In addition, HHS has\neffectively exempted certain religious nonprofit organizations,\ndescribed under HHS regulations as \u201celigible organizations,\u201d from\nthe contraceptive mandate. See 45 CFR \u00a7147.131(b); 78 Fed. Reg.\n39874 (2013). An \u201celigible organization\u201d means a nonprofit\norganization that \u201cholds itself out as a religious organi-zation\u201d\nand \u201copposes providing coverage for some or all of any\ncontraceptive services required to be covered .\u00a0.\u00a0. on\naccount of religious objections.\u201d 45 CFR \u00a7147.131(b). To qualify\nfor this accommodation, an employer must certify that it is such an\norganization. \u00a0\u00a7147.131(b)(4). When a group-health-insurance\nissuer receives notice that one of its clients has invoked this\nprovision, the issuer must then exclude contraceptive coverage from\nthe employer\u2019s plan and provide separate payments for contraceptive\nservices for plan participants without imposing any cost-sharing\nrequirements on the eligible organization, its insurance plan, or\nits employee beneficiaries. \u00a7147.131(c).[8] Al-though this procedure requires the issuer to bear\nthe cost of these services, HHS has determined that this obligation\nwill not impose any net expense on issuers because its cost will be\nless than or equal to the cost savings resulting from the services.\n78 Fed. Reg. 39877.[9]In addition to these\nexemptions for religious organizations, ACA exempts a great many\nemployers from most of its coverage requirements. Employers\nproviding \u201cgrandfathered health plans\u201d\u2014those that existed prior to\nMarch 23, 2010, and that have not made specified changes after that\ndate\u2014need not comply with many of the Act\u2019s requirements, including\nthe contraceptive mandate. 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a718011(a), (e).\nAnd employers with fewer than 50 employees are not required to\nprovide health insurance at all. 26\u00a0U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a74980H(c)(2).All told, the\ncontraceptive mandate \u201cpresently does not apply to tens of millions\nof people.\u201d 723 F.\u00a03d 1114, 1143 (CA10 2013). This is\nattributable, in large part, to grandfathered health plans: Over\none-third of the 149 million nonelderly people in America with\nemployer-sponsored health plans were enrolled in grandfathered\nplans in 2013. Brief for HHS in No. 13\u2013354, at 53; Kaiser Family\nFoundation & Health Research & Educational Trust, Employer\nHealth Benefits, 2013 Annual Survey 43, 221.[10] The count for employees working for firms\nthat do not have to provide insurance at all because they employ\nfewer than 50 employees is 34 million workers. See The Whitehouse,\nHealth Reform for Small Businesses: The Affordable Care Act\nIncreases Choice and Saving Money for Small Businesses 1.[11]IIANorman and Elizabeth\nHahn and their three sons are devout members of the Mennonite\nChurch, a Christian denomination. The Mennonite Church opposes\nabortion and believes that \u201c[t]he fetus in its earliest stages\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. shares humanity with those who conceived\nit.\u201d[12]Fifty years ago, Norman\nHahn started a wood-working business in his garage, and since then,\nthis company, Conestoga Wood Specialties, has grown and now has 950\nemployees. Conestoga is organized under Pennsylvania law as a\nfor-profit corporation. The Hahns exercise sole ownership of the\nclosely held business; they control its board of directors and hold\nall of its voting shares. One of the Hahn sons serves as the\npresident and CEO.The Hahns believe that\nthey are required to run their business \u201cin accordance with their\nreligious beliefs and moral principles.\u201d 917 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d 394,\n402 (ED Pa. 2013). To that end, the company\u2019s mission, as they see\nit, is to \u201coperate in a professional environment founded upon the\nhighest ethical, moral, and Christian principles.\u201d Ibid. (internal\nquotation marks omitted). The company\u2019s \u201cVision and Values\nStatements\u201d affirms that Conestoga endeavors to \u201censur[e] a\nreasonable profit in [a] manner that reflects [the Hahns\u2019]\nChristian heritage.\u201d App. in No. 13\u2013356, p.\u00a094\n(complaint).As explained in\nConestoga\u2019s board-adopted \u201cStatement on the Sanctity of Human\nLife,\u201d the Hahns believe that \u201chuman life begins at conception.\u201d\n724 F.\u00a03d 377, 382, and n.\u00a05 (CA3 2013) (internal\nquotation marks omitted). It is therefore \u201cagainst [their] moral\nconviction to be involved in the termination of human life\u201d after\nconception, which they believe is a \u201csin against God to which they\nare held accountable.\u201d Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).\nThe Hahns have accordingly excluded from the group-health-insurance\nplan they offer to their employees certain contraceptive methods\nthat they consider to be abortifacients. Id., at 382.The Hahns and Conestoga\nsued HHS and other federal officials and agencies under RFRA and\nthe Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment, seeking to enjoin\napplication of ACA\u2019s contraceptive mandate insofar as it requires\nthem to provide health-insurance coverage for four FDA-approved\ncontraceptives that may operate after the fertilization of an\negg.[13] These include two\nforms of emergency contraception commonly called \u201cmorning after\u201d\npills and two types of intrauterine devices.[14]In opposing the\nrequirement to provide coverage for the contraceptives to which\nthey object, the Hahns argued that \u201cit is immoral and sinful for\n[them] to intentionally participate in, pay for, facilitate, or\notherwise support these drugs.\u201d Ibid. The District Court denied a\npreliminary injunction, see 917 F.\u00a0Supp.\u00a02d, at 419, and\nthe Third Circuit affirmed in a divided opinion, holding that\n\u201cfor-profit, secular corporations cannot engage in religious\nexercise\u201d within the meaning of RFRA or the First Amendment. 724\nF.\u00a03d, at 381. The Third Circuit also rejected the claims\nbrought by the Hahns themselves because it concluded that the HHS\n\u201c[m]andate does not impose any requirements on the Hahns\u201d in their\npersonal capacity. Id., at 389.BDavid and Barbara\nGreen and their three children are Christians who own and operate\ntwo family businesses. Forty-five years ago, David Green started an\narts-and-crafts store that has grown into a nationwide chain called\nHobby Lobby. There are now 500 Hobby Lobby stores, and the company\nhas more than 13,000 employees. 723 F.\u00a03d, at 1122. Hobby\nLobby is organized as a for-profit corporation under Oklahoma\nlaw.One of David\u2019s sons\nstarted an affiliated business, Mardel, which operates 35 Christian\nbookstores and employs close to 400 people. Ibid. Mardel is also\norganized as a for-profit corporation under Oklahoma law.Though these two\nbusinesses have expanded over the years, they remain closely held,\nand David, Barbara, and their children retain exclusive control of\nboth companies. Ibid. David serves as the CEO of Hobby Lobby, and\nhis three children serve as the president, vice president, and vice\nCEO. See Brief for Respondents in No. 13\u2013354, p.\u00a08.[15]Hobby Lobby\u2019s statement\nof purpose commits the Greens to \u201c[h]onoring the Lord in all [they]\ndo by operating the company in a manner consistent with Biblical\nprinciples.\u201d App. in No. 13\u2013354, pp. 134\u2013135 (complaint). Each\nfamily member has signed a pledge to run the businesses in\naccordance with the family\u2019s religious beliefs and to use the\nfamily assets to support Christian ministries. 723 F.\u00a03d, at\n1122. In accordance with those commitments, Hobby Lobby and Mardel\nstores close on Sundays, even though the Greens calculate that they\nlose millions in sales annually by doing so. Id., at 1122; App. in\nNo. 13\u2013354, at 136\u2013137. The businesses refuse to engage in\nprofitable transactions that facilitate or promote alcohol use;\nthey contribute profits to Christian missionaries and ministries;\nand they buy hundreds of full-page newspaper ads inviting people to\n\u201cknow Jesus as Lord and Savior.\u201d Ibid. (internal quotation marks\nomitted).Like the Hahns, the\nGreens believe that life begins at conception and that it would\nviolate their religion to facilitate access to contraceptive drugs\nor devices that operate after that point. 723 F.\u00a03d, at 1122.\nThey specifically object to the same four contraceptive methods as\nthe Hahns and, like the Hahns, they have no objection to the other\n16 FDA-approved methods of birth control. Id., at 1125. Although\ntheir group-health-insurance plan predates the enactment of ACA, it\nis not a grandfathered plan because Hobby Lobby elected not to\nretain grandfathered status before the contraceptive mandate was\nproposed. Id., at 1124.The Greens, Hobby\nLobby, and Mardel sued HHS and other federal agencies and officials\nto challenge the contraceptive mandate under RFRA and the Free\nExercise Clause.[16] The\nDistrict Court denied a preliminary injunction, see 870 F. Supp. 2d\n1278 (WD Okla. 2012), and the plaintiffs appealed, moving for\ninitial en banc consideration. The Tenth Circuit granted that\nmotion and reversed in a divided opinion. Contrary to the\nconclusion of the Third Circuit, the Tenth Circuit held that the\nGreens\u2019 two for-profit businesses are \u201cpersons\u201d within the meaning\nof RFRA and therefore may bring suit under that law.The court then held\nthat the corporations had established a likelihood of success on\ntheir RFRA claim. 723 F.\u00a03d, at 1140\u20131147. The court concluded\nthat the contraceptive mandate substantially burdened the exercise\nof religion by requiring the companies to choose between\n\u201ccompromis[ing] their religious beliefs\u201d and paying a heavy\nfee\u2014either \u201cclose to $475 million more in taxes every year\u201d if they\nsimply refused to provide coverage for the contraceptives at issue,\nor \u201croughly $26 million\u201d annually if they \u201cdrop[ped]\nhealth-insurance benefits for all employees.\u201d Id., at 1141.The court next held\nthat HHS had failed to demonstrate a compelling interest in\nenforcing the mandate against the Greens\u2019 businesses and, in the\nalternative, that HHS had failed to prove that enforcement of the\nmandate was the \u201cleast restrictive means\u201d of furthering the\nGovernment\u2019s asserted interests. Id., at 1143\u20131144 (emphasis\ndeleted; internal quotation marks omitted). After concluding that\nthe companies had \u201cdemonstrated irreparable harm,\u201d the court\nreversed and remanded for the District Court to consider the\nremaining factors of the preliminary-injunction test. Id., at\n1147.[17]We granted certiorari.\n571 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2013).IIIARFRA prohibits the\n\u201cGovernment [from] substantially burden[ing] a person\u2019s exercise of\nreligion even if the burden results from a rule of general\napplicability\u201d unless the Government \u201cdemonstrates that application\nof the burden to the person\u2014(1) is in furtherance of a compelling\ngovernmental interest; and (2) is the least restrictive means of\nfurthering that compelling governmental interest.\u201d 42\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\u00a0\u00a7\u00a72000bb\u20131(a), (b) (emphasis added). The\nfirst question that we must address is whether this provision\napplies to regulations that govern the activities of for-profit\ncorporations like Hobby Lobby, Conestoga, and Mardel.HHS contends that\nneither these companies nor their owners can even be heard under\nRFRA. According to HHS, the companies cannot sue because they seek\nto make a profit for their owners, and the owners cannotbe heard\nbecause the regulations, at least as a formal mat-ter, apply only\nto the companies and not to the ownersas individuals. HHS\u2019s\nargument would have dramatic consequences.Consider this Court\u2019s\ndecision in Braunfeld v. Brown, 366 U.\u00a0S. 599 (1961)\n(plurality opinion). In that case, five Orthodox Jewish merchants\nwho ran small retail businesses in Philadelphia challenged a\nPennsylvania Sunday closing law as a violation of the Free Exercise\nClause. Because of their faith, these merchants closed their shops\non Saturday, and they argued that requiring them to remain shut on\nSunday threatened them with financial ruin. The Court entertained\ntheir claim (although it ruled against them on the merits), and if\na similar claim were raised today under RFRA against a jurisdiction\nstill subject to the Act (for example, the District of Columbia,\nsee 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72000bb\u20132(2)), the merchants would be\nentitled to be heard. According to HHS, however, if these merchants\nchose to incorporate their businesses\u2014with-out in any way changing\nthe size or nature of their businesses\u2014they would forfeit all RFRA\n(and free-exercise) rights. HHS would put these merchants to a\ndifficult choice: either give up the right to seek judicial\nprotection of their religious liberty or forgo the benefits,\navailable to their competitors, of operating as corporations.As we have seen, RFRA\nwas designed to provide very broad protection for religious\nliberty. By enacting RFRA, Congress went far beyond what this Court\nhas held is constitutionally required.[18] Is there any reason to think that the Congress\nthat enacted such sweeping protection put small-business owners to\nthe choice that HHS suggests? An examination of RFRA\u2019s text, to\nwhich we turn in the next part of this opinion, reveals that\nCongress did no such thing.As we will show,\nCongress provided protection for people like the Hahns and Greens\nby employing a familiar legal fiction: It included corporations\nwithin RFRA\u2019s definition of \u201cpersons.\u201d But it is important to keep\nin mind that the purpose of this fiction is to provide protection\nfor human beings. A corporation is simply a form of organization\nused by human beings to achieve desired ends. An established body\nof law specifies the rights and obligations of the people\n(including shareholders, officers, and employees) who are\nassociated with a corporation in one way or another. When rights,\nwhether constitutional or statu-tory, are extended to corporations,\nthe purpose is to protect the rights of these people. For example,\nextending Fourth Amendment protection to corporations protects the\nprivacy interests of employees and others associated with the\ncompany. Protecting corporations from government seizure of their\nproperty without just compensation protects all those who have a\nstake in the corporations\u2019 financial well-being. And protecting the\nfree-exercise rights of corporations like Hobby Lobby, Conestoga,\nand Mardel protects the religious liberty of the humans who own and\ncontrol those companies.In holding that\nConestoga, as a \u201csecular, for-profit corporation,\u201d lacks RFRA\nprotection, the Third Circuit wrote as follows:\u201cGeneral business corporations do not,\nseparate and apart from the actions or belief systems of their\nindividual owners or employees, exercise religion. They do not\npray, worship, observe sacraments or take other\nreligiously-motivated actions separate and apart from the intention\nand direction of their individual actors.\u201d 724 F.\u00a03d, at 385\n(emphasis added).All of this is true\u2014but quite beside the point.\nCorporations, \u201cseparate and apart from\u201d the human beings who own,\nrun, and are employed by them, cannot do anything at all.B1As we noted above,\nRFRA applies to \u201ca person\u2019s\u201d exercise of religion, 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a7\u00a72000bb\u20131(a), (b), and RFRA itself does not define the term\n\u201cperson.\u201d We therefore look to the Dictionary Act, which we must\nconsult \u201c[i]n determining the meaning of any Act of Congress,\nunless the context indicates otherwise.\u201d 1 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a71.Under the Dictionary\nAct, \u201cthe wor[d] \u2018person\u2019 .\u00a0.\u00a0. include[s] corporations,\ncompanies, associations, firms, partnerships, societies, and joint\nstock companies, as well as individuals.\u201d Ibid.; see FCC v.\nAT&T Inc., 562 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 6) (\u201cWe\nhave no doubt that \u2018person,\u2019 in a legal setting, often refers to\nartificial entities. The Dictionary Act makes that clear\u201d). Thus,\nunless there is something about the RFRA context that \u201cindicates\notherwise,\u201d the Dictionary Act provides a quick, clear, and\naffirmative answer to the question whether the companies involved\nin these cases may be heard.We see nothing in RFRA\nthat suggests a congressional intent to depart from the Dictionary\nAct definition, and HHS makes little effort to argue otherwise. We\nhave entertained RFRA and free-exercise claims brought by nonprofit\ncorporations, see Gonzales v. O Centro Esp\u00edrita Beneficiente Uni\u00e3o\ndo Vegetal, 546 U.\u00a0S. 418 (2006) (RFRA); Hosanna-Tabor\nEvangelical Lutheran Church and School v. EEOC, 565 U.\u00a0S. ___\n(2012) (Free Exercise); Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v.\nHialeah, 508 U. S. 520 (1993) (Free Exercise), and HHS concedes\nthat a nonprofit corporation can be a \u201cperson\u201d within the meaning\nof RFRA. See Brief for HHS in No. 13\u2013354, at 17; Reply Brief in No.\n13\u2013354, at 7\u20138.[19]This concession\neffectively dispatches any argument that the term \u201cperson\u201d as used\nin RFRA does not reach the closely held corporations involved in\nthese cases. No known understanding of the term \u201cperson\u201d includes\nsome but not all corporations. The term \u201cperson\u201d sometimes\nencompasses artificial persons (as the Dictionary Act instructs),\nand it sometimes is limited to natural persons. But no conceivable\ndefinition of the term includes natural persons and nonprofit\ncorporations, but not for-profit corporations.[20] Cf. Clark v. Martinez, 543 U. S. 371, 378\n(2005) (\u201cTo give th[e] same words a different meaning for each\ncategory would be to invent a statute rather than interpret\none\u201d).2The principal\nargument advanced by HHS and the principal dissent regarding RFRA\nprotection for Hobby Lobby, Conestoga, and Mardel focuses not on\nthe statutory term \u201cperson,\u201d but on the phrase \u201cexercise of\nreligion.\u201d According to HHS and the dissent, these corporations are\nnot protected by RFRA because they cannot exercise religion.\nNeither HHS nor the dissent, however, provides any persuasive\nexplanation for this conclusion.Is it because of the\ncorporate form? The corporate form alone cannot provide the\nexplanation because, as we have pointed out, HHS concedes that\nnonprofit corporations can be protected by RFRA. The dissent\nsuggests that nonprofit corporations are special because furthering\ntheir reli-gious \u201cautonomy . . . often furthers individual\nreligious freedom as well.\u201d Post, at 15 (quoting Corporation of\nPresiding Bishop of Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints v.\nAmos, 483 U.\u00a0S. 327, 342 (1987) (Brennan, J., concurring in\njudgment)). But this principle appliesequally to for-profit\ncorporations: Furthering their re-ligious freedom also \u201cfurthers\nindividual religious freedom.\u201d In these cases, for example,\nallowing Hobby Lobby, Con-estoga, and Mardel to assert RFRA claims\nprotects the religious liberty of the Greens and the\nHahns.[21]If the corporate form\nis not enough, what about the profit-making objective? In\nBraunfeld, 366 U.\u00a0S. 599 , we entertained the free-exercise\nclaims of individuals who were attempting to make a profit as\nretail merchants, and the Court never even hinted that this\nobjective precluded their claims. As the Court explained in a later\ncase, the \u201cexercise of religion\u201d involves \u201cnot only belief and\nprofession but the performance of (or abstention from) physical\nacts\u201d that are \u201cengaged in for religious reasons.\u201d Smith,\n494\u00a0U.\u00a0S., at 877. Business practices that are compelled\nor limited by the tenets of a religious doctrine fall comfortably\nwithin that definition. Thus, a law that \u201coperates so as to make\nthe practice of .\u00a0.\u00a0. religious beliefs more expensive\u201d\nin the context of business activities imposes a burden on the\nexercise of religion. Braunfeld, supra, at 605; see United States\nv. Lee, 455 U.\u00a0S. 252, 257 (1982) (recognizing that\n\u201ccompulsory participation in the social security system interferes\nwith [Amish employers\u2019] free exercise rights\u201d).If, as Braunfeld\nrecognized, a sole proprietorship that seeks to make a profit may\nassert a free-exercise claim,[22] why can\u2019t Hobby Lobby, Conestoga, and Mardel do the\nsame?Some lower court judges\nhave suggested that RFRA does not protect for-profit corporations\nbecause the purpose of such corporations is simply to make\nmoney.[23] This argument\nflies in the face of modern corporate law. \u201cEach American\njurisdiction today either expressly or by implication authorizes\ncorporations to be formed under its general corporation act for any\nlawful purpose or business.\u201d 1 J. Cox & T. Hazen, Treatise of\nthe Law of Corporations \u00a74:1, p.\u00a0224 (3d ed. 2010) (emphasis\nadded); see 1A W. Fletcher, Cyclopedia of the Law of Corporations\n\u00a7102 (rev. ed. 2010). While it is certainly true that a central\nobjective of for-profit corporations is to make money, modern\ncorporate law does not require for-profit corporations to pursue\nprofit at the expense of everything else, and many do not do so.\nFor-profit corporations, with ownership approval, support a wide\nvariety of charitable causes, and it is not at all uncommon for\nsuch corporations to further humanitarian and other altruistic\nobjectives. Many examples come readily to mind. So long as its\nowners agree, a for-profit corporation may take costly\npollution-control and energy-conservation measures that go beyond\nwhat the law requires. A for-profit corporation that operates\nfacilities in other countries may exceed the requirements of local\nlaw regarding working conditions and benefits. If for-profit\ncorporations may pursue such worthy objectives, there is no\napparent reason why they may not further religious objectives as\nwell.HHS would draw a sharp\nline between nonprofit corporations (which, HHS concedes, are\nprotected by RFRA) and for-profit corporations (which HHS would\nleave unprotected), but the actual picture is less clear-cut. Not\nall corporations that decline to organize as nonprofits do so in\norder to maximize profit. For example, organizations with religious\nand charitable aims might organize as for-profit corporations\nbecause of the potential advantages of that corporate form, such as\nthe freedom to participate in lobbying for legislation or\ncampaigning for political candidates who promote their religious or\ncharitable goals.[24] In\nfact, recognizing the inherent compatibility between establishing a\nfor-profit corporation and pursuing nonprofit goals, States have\nincreasingly adopted laws formally recognizing hybrid corporate\nforms. Over half of the States, for instance, now recognize the\n\u201cbenefit corporation,\u201d a dual-purpose entity that seeks to achieve\nboth a benefit for the public and a profit for its owners.[25]In any event, the\nobjectives that may properly be pursued by the companies in these\ncases are governed by the laws of the States in which they were\nincorporated\u2014Pennsylvania and Oklahoma\u2014and the laws of those States\npermit for-profit corporations to pursue \u201cany lawful purpose\u201d or\n\u201cact,\u201d including the pursuit of profit in conformity with the\nowners\u2019 religious principles. 15 Pa. Cons. Stat. \u00a71301 (2001)\n(\u201cCorporations may be incorporated under this subpart for any\nlawful purpose or purposes\u201d); Okla. Stat., Tit. 18, \u00a7\u00a71002, 1005\n(West 2012) (\u201c[E]very corporation, whether profit or not for\nprofit\u201d may \u201cbe incorporated or organized .\u00a0.\u00a0. to\nconduct or promote any lawful business or purposes\u201d); see also\n\u00a71006(A)(3); Brief for State of Oklahoma as Amicus Curiae in No.\n13\u2013354.3HHS and the principal\ndissent make one additional argument in an effort to show that a\nfor-profit corporation cannot engage in the \u201cexercise of religion\u201d\nwithin the meaning of RFRA: HHS argues that RFRA did no more than\ncodify this Court\u2019s pre-Smith Free Exercise Clause precedents, and\nbecause none of those cases squarely held that a for-profit\ncorporation has free-exercise rights, RFRA does not confer such\nprotection. This argument has many flaws.First, nothing in the\ntext of RFRA as originally enacted suggested that the statutory\nphrase \u201cexercise of religion under the First Amendment\u201d was meant\nto be tied to this Court\u2019s pre-Smith interpretation of that\nAmendment. When first enacted, RFRA defined the \u201cexercise of\nreligion\u201d to mean \u201cthe exercise of religion under the First\nAmendment\u201d\u2014not the exercise of religion as recognized only by\nthen-existing Supreme Court precedents. 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a72000bb\u20132(4) (1994 ed.). When Congress wants to link the meaning of\na statutory provision to a body of this Court\u2019s case law, it knows\nhow to do so. See, e.g., Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty\nAct of 1996, 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72254(d)(1) (authorizing habeas\nrelief from a state-court decision that \u201cwas contrary to, or\ninvolved an unreasonable application of, clearly established\nFederal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United\nStates\u201d).Second, if the original\ntext of RFRA was not clear enough on this point\u2014and we think it\nwas\u2014the amendment of RFRA through RLUIPA surely dispels any doubt.\nThat amendment deleted the prior reference to the First Amendment,\nsee 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72000bb\u20132(4) (2000 ed.) (incorporating\n\u00a72000cc\u20135), and neither HHS nor the principal dissent can explain\nwhy Congress did this if it wanted to tie RFRA coverage tightly to\nthe specific holdings of our pre-Smith free-exercise cases.\nMoreover, as discussed, the amendment went further, providing that\nthe exercise of religion \u201cshall be construed in favor of a broad\nprotection of religious exercise, to the maximum extent permitted\nby the terms of this chapter and the Constitution.\u201d \u00a72000cc\u20133(g).\nIt is simply not possible to read these provisions as restricting\nthe concept of the \u201cexercise of religion\u201d to those practices\nspecifically addressed in our pre-Smith decisions.Third, the one\npre-Smith case involving the free-exercise rights of a for-profit\ncorporation suggests, if anything, that for-profit corporations\npossess such rights. In Gallagher v. Crown Kosher Super Market of\nMass., Inc., 366 U.\u00a0S. 617 (1961) , the Massachusetts Sunday\nclosing law was challenged by a kosher market that was organized as\na for-profit corporation, by customers of the market, and by a\nrabbi. The Commonwealth argued that the corporation lacked\n\u201cstanding\u201d to assert a free-exercise claim,[26] but not one member of the Court expressed\nagreement with that argument. The plurality opinion for four\nJustices rejected the First Amendment claim on the merits based on\nthe reasoning in Braunfeld, and reserved decision on the question\nwhether the corporation had \u201cstanding\u201d to raise the claim. See 366\nU.\u00a0S., at 631. The three dissenters, Justices Douglas,\nBrennan, and Stewart, found the law unconstitutional as applied to\nthe corporation and the other challengers and thus implicitly\nrecognized their right to assert a free-exercise claim. See id., at\n642 (Brennan, J., joined by Stewart, J., dissenting); McGowan v.\nMaryland, 366 U.\u00a0S. 420 \u2013579 (1961) (Douglas, J., dissenting\nas to related cases including Gallagher). Fi-nally, Justice\nFrankfurter\u2019s opinion, which was joined by Justice Harlan, upheld\nthe Massachusetts law on the merits but did not question or reserve\ndecision on the issue of the right of the corporation or any of the\nother challengers to be heard. See McGowan, 366 U.\u00a0S., at\n521\u2013522. It is quite a stretch to argue that RFRA, a law enacted to\nprovide very broad protection for religious liberty,left for-profit\ncorporations unprotected simply because in Gallagher\u2014the only\npre-Smith case in which the issue was raised\u2014a majority of the\nJustices did not find it necessary to decide whether the kosher\nmarket\u2019s corporate status barred it from raising a free-exercise\nclaim.Finally, the\nresults would be absurd if RFRA merely restored this Court\u2019s\npre-Smith decisions in ossified form and did not allow a plaintiff\nto raise a RFRA claim unless that plaintiff fell within a category\nof plaintiffs one of whom had brought a free-exercise claim that\nthis Court entertained in the years before Smith. For example, we\nare not aware of any pre-Smith case in which this Court entertained\na free-exercise claim brought by a resident noncitizen. Are such\npersons also beyond RFRA\u2019s protective reach simply because the\nCourt never addressed their rights before Smith?Presumably in\nrecognition of the weakness of this argument, both HHS and the\nprincipal dissent fall back on the broader contention that the\nNation lacks a tradition of exempting for-profit corporations from\ngenerally applicable laws. By contrast, HHS contends, statutes like\nTitle VII, 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72000e\u201319(A), expressly exempt\nchurches and other nonprofit religious institutions but not\nfor-profit corporations. See Brief for HHS in No. 13\u2013356,\np.\u00a026. In making this argument, however, HHS did not call to\nour attention the fact that some federal statutes do exempt\ncategories of entities that include for-profit corporations from\nlaws that would otherwise require these entities to engage in\nactivities to which they object on grounds of conscience. See,\ne.g., 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7300a\u20137(b)(2); \u00a7238n(a).[27] If Title VII and similar laws show\nanything, it isthat Congress speaks with specificity when it\nintends a religious accommodation not to extend to\nfor-profitcorporations.4Finally, HHS contends\nthat Congress could not have wanted RFRA to apply to for-profit\ncorporations because it is difficult as a practical matter to\nascertain the sincere \u201cbeliefs\u201d of a corporation. HHS goes so far\nas to raise the specter of \u201cdivisive, polarizing proxy battles over\nthe religious identity of large, publicly traded corporations such\nas IBM or General Electric.\u201d Brief for HHS in No. 13\u2013356, at\n30.These cases, however,\ndo not involve publicly traded corporations, and it seems unlikely\nthat the sort of corporate giants to which HHS refers will often\nassert RFRA claims. HHS has not pointed to any example of a\npublicly traded corporation asserting RFRA rights, and numerous\npractical restraints would likely prevent that from occurring. For\nexample, the idea that unrelated shareholders\u2014including\ninstitutional investors with their own set of stakeholders\u2014would\nagree to run a corporation under the same religious beliefs seems\nimprobable. In any event, we have no occasion in these cases to\nconsider RFRA\u2019s applicability to such companies. The companies in\nthe cases before us are closely held corporations, each owned and\ncontrolled by members of a single family, and no one has disputed\nthe sincerity of their religious beliefs.[28]HHS has also provided\nno evidence that the purported problem of determining the sincerity\nof an asserted religious belief moved Congress to exclude\nfor-profit corporations from RFRA\u2019s protection. On the contrary,\nthe scope of RLUIPA shows that Congress was confident of the\nability of the federal courts to weed out insincere claims. RLUIPA\napplies to \u201cinstitutionalized persons,\u201d a category that consists\nprimarily of prisoners, and by the time of RLUIPA\u2019s enactment, the\npropensity of some prisoners to assert claims of dubious sincerity\nwas well documented.[29]\nNevertheless, after our decision in City of Boerne, Congress\nenacted RLUIPA to preserve the right of prisoners to raise\nreligious liberty claims. If Congress thought that the federal\ncourts were up to the job of dealing with insincere prisoner\nclaims, there is no reason to believe that Congress limited RFRA\u2019s\nreach out of concern for the seem-ingly less difficult task of\ndoing the same in corporate cases. And if, as HHS seems to concede,\nCongress wanted RFRA to apply to nonprofit corporations, see, Reply\nBrief in No. 13\u2013354, at 7\u20138, what reason is there to think that\nCongress believed that spotting insincere claims wouldbe tougher in\ncases involving for-profits?HHS and the principal\ndissent express concern about the possibility of disputes among the\nowners of corporations, but that is not a problem that arises\nbecause of RFRA or that is unique to this context. The owners of\nclosely held corporations may\u2014and sometimes do\u2014disagree about the\nconduct of business. 1 Treatise of the Law of Corporations \u00a714:11.\nAnd even if RFRA did not exist, the owners of a company might well\nhave a dispute relating to religion. For example, some might want a\ncompany\u2019s stores to remain open on the Sabbath in order to make\nmore money, and others might want the stores to close for religious\nreasons. State corporate law provides a ready means for resolving\nany conflicts by, for example, dictating how a corporation can\nestablish its governing structure. See, e.g., ibid; id., \u00a73:2; Del.\nCode Ann., Tit. 8, \u00a7351 (2011) (providing that certificate of\nincorporation may provide how \u201cthe business of the corporation\nshall be managed\u201d). Courts will turn to that structure and the\nunderlying state law in resolving disputes.For all these reasons,\nwe hold that a federal regulation\u2019s restriction on the activities\nof a for-profit closely held corporation must comply with\nRFRA.[30]IVBecause RFRA applies\nin these cases, we must next ask whether the HHS contraceptive\nmandate \u201csubstantially burden[s]\u201d the exercise of religion. 42\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72000bb\u20131(a). We have little trouble concluding\nthat it does.AAs we have noted, the\nHahns and Greens have a sincere religious belief that life begins\nat conception. They therefore object on religious grounds to\nproviding health insurance that covers methods of birth control\nthat, as HHS acknowledges, see Brief for HHS in No. 13\u2013354, at 9,\nn.\u00a04, may result in the destruction of an embryo. By requiring\nthe Hahns and Greens and their companies to arrange for such\ncoverage, the HHS mandate demands that they engage in conduct that\nseriously violates their religious beliefs.If the Hahns and Greens\nand their companies do not yield to this demand, the economic\nconsequences will be severe. If the companies continue to offer\ngroup health plans that do not cover the contraceptives at issue,\nthey will be taxed $100 per day for each affected individual. 26\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a74980D. For Hobby Lobby, the bill could amount\nto $1.3 million per day or about $475 million per year; for\nConestoga, the assessment could be $90,000 per day or $33 million\nper year; and for Mardel, it could be $40,000 per day or about $15\nmillion per year. These sums are surely substantial.It is true that the\nplaintiffs could avoid these assessments by dropping insurance\ncoverage altogether and thus forcing their employees to obtain\nhealth insurance on one of the exchanges established under ACA. But\nif at least one of their full-time employees were to qualify for a\nsubsidy on one of the government-run exchanges, this course would\nalso entail substantial economic consequences. The companies could\nface penalties of $2,000 per employee each year. \u00a74980H. These\npenalties would amount to roughly $26 million for Hobby Lobby, $1.8\nmillion for Conestoga, and $800,000 for Mardel.BAlthough these totals\nare high, amici supporting HHS have suggested that the $2,000\nper-employee penalty is actually less than the average cost of\nproviding health insurance, see Brief for Religious Organizations\n22, and therefore, they claim, the companies could readily\neliminate any substantial burden by forcing their employees to\nobtain insurance in the government exchanges. We do not generally\nentertain arguments that were not raised below and are not advanced\nin this Court by any party, see United Parcel Service, Inc. v.\nMitchell, 451 U.\u00a0S. 56 , n.\u00a02 (1981); Bell v. Wolfish,\n441 U.\u00a0S. 520 , n.\u00a013 (1979); Knetsch v. United States,\n364 U.\u00a0S. 361, 370 (1960) , and there are strong reasons to\nadhere to that practice in these cases. HHS, which presumably could\nhave compiled the relevant statistics, has never made this\nargument\u2014not in its voluminous briefing or at oral argument in this\nCourt nor, to our knowledge, in any of the numerous cases in which\nthe issue now before us has been litigated around the country. As\nthings now stand, we do not even know what the Government\u2019s\nposition might be with respect to these amici\u2019s intensely empirical\nargument.[31] For this same\nreason, the plaintiffs have never had an opportunity to respond to\nthis novel claim that\u2014contrary to their longstanding practice and\nthat of most large employers\u2014they would be better off discarding\ntheir employer insurance plans altogether.Even if we were to\nreach this argument, we would find it unpersuasive. As an initial\nmatter, it entirely ignores the fact that the Hahns and Greens and\ntheir companies have religious reasons for providing\nhealth-insurance coverage for their employees. Before the advent of\nACA, they were not legally compelled to provide insurance, but they\nnevertheless did so\u2014in part, no doubt, for conventional business\nreasons, but also in part because their religious beliefs govern\ntheir relations with their employees. See App. to Pet. for Cert. in\nNo. 13\u2013356, p.\u00a011g; App. in No. 13\u2013354, at\u00a0139.Putting aside the\nreligious dimension of the decision to provide insurance, moreover,\nit is far from clear that the net cost to the companies of\nproviding insurance is more than the cost of dropping their\ninsurance plans and paying the ACA penalty. Health insurance is a\nbenefit that employees value. If the companies simply eliminated\nthat benefit and forced employees to purchase their own insurance\non the exchanges, without offering additional compensation, it is\npredictable that the companies would face a competitive\ndisadvantage in retaining and attracting skilled workers. See App.\nin No. 13\u2013354, at 153.The companies could\nattempt to make up for the elimination of a group health plan by\nincreasing wages, but this would be costly. Group health insurance\nis generally less expensive than comparable individual coverage, so\nthe amount of the salary increase needed to fully compensate for\nthe termination of insurance coverage may well exceed the cost to\nthe companies of providing the insurance. In addition, any salary\nincrease would have to take into account the fact that employees\nmust pay income taxes on wages but not on the value of\nemployer-provided health insurance. 26 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7106(a).\nLikewise, employers can deduct the cost of providing health\ninsurance, see \u00a7162(a)(1), but apparently cannot deduct the amount\nof the penalty that they must pay if insurance is not pro-vided;\nthat difference also must be taken into account. Given these\neconomic incentives, it is far from clear that it would be\nfinancially advantageous for an employer to drop coverage and pay\nthe penalty.[32]In sum, we refuse to\nsustain the challenged regulations on the ground\u2014never maintained\nby the Government\u2014that dropping insurance coverage eliminates the\nsubstantial burden that the HHS mandate imposes. We doubt that the\nCongress that enacted RFRA\u2014or, for that matter, ACA\u2014would have\nbelieved it a tolerable result to put family-run businesses to the\nchoice of violating their sincerely held religious beliefs or\nmaking all of their employees lose their existing healthcare\nplans.CIn taking the\nposition that the HHS mandate does not impose a substantial burden\non the exercise of religion, HHS\u2019s main argument (echoed by the\nprincipal dissent) is basically that the connection between what\nthe objecting parties must do (provide health-insurance coverage\nfor four methods of contraception that may operate after the\nfertilization of an egg) and the end that they find to be morally\nwrong (destruction of an embryo) is simply too attenuated. Brief\nfor HHS in 13\u2013354, pp. 31\u201334; post, at 22\u201323. HHS and the dissent\nnote that providing the coverage would not itself result in the\ndestruction of an embryo; that would occur only if an employee\nchose to take advantage of the coverage and to use one of the four\nmethods at issue.[33]\nIbid.This argument dodges\nthe question that RFRA presents (whether the HHS mandate imposes a\nsubstantial burden on the ability of the objecting parties to\nconduct business in accordance with their religious beliefs) and\ninstead addresses a very different question that the federal courts\nhave no business addressing (whether the religious belief asserted\nin a RFRA case is reasonable). The Hahns and Greens believe that\nproviding the coverage demanded by the HHS regulations is connected\nto the destruction of an embryo in a way that is sufficient to make\nit immoral for them to provide the coverage. This belief implicates\na difficult and important question of religion and moral\nphilosophy, namely, the circumstances under which it is wrong for a\nperson to perform an act that is innocent in itself but that has\nthe effect of enabling or facilitating the commission of an immoral\nact by another.[34]\nArrogating the authority to provide a binding national answer to\nthis religious and philosophical question, HHS and the principal\ndissent in effect tell the plaintiffs that their beliefs are\nflawed. For good reason, we have repeatedly refused to take such a\nstep. See, e.g., Smith, 494 U.\u00a0S., at 887 (\u201cRepeatedly and in\nmany different contexts, we have warned that courts must not\npresume to determine .\u00a0.\u00a0. the plausibility of a\nreligious claim\u201d); Hernandez v. Commissioner, 490 U.\u00a0S. 680,\n699 (1989) ; Presbyterian Church in U.\u00a0S. v. Mary Elizabeth\nBlue Hull Memorial Presbyterian Church, 393 U.\u00a0S. 440, 450\n(1969) .Moreover, in Thomas v.\nReview Bd. of Indiana Employment Security Div., 450 U.\u00a0S. 707\n(1981) , we considered and rejected an argument that is nearly\nidentical to the one now urged by HHS and the dissent. In Thomas, a\nJehovah\u2019s Witness was initially employed making sheet steel for a\nvariety of industrial uses, but he was later transferred to a job\nmaking turrets for tanks. Id., at 710. Because he objected on\nreligious grounds to participating in the manufacture of weapons,\nhe lost his job and sought unemployment compensation. Ruling\nagainst the em-ployee, the state court had difficulty with the line\nthatthe employee drew between work that he found to be con-sistent\nwith his religious beliefs (helping to manufacture steel that was\nused in making weapons) and work that he found morally\nobjectionable (helping to make the weapons themselves). This Court,\nhowever, held that \u201cit is not for us to say that the line he drew\nwas an unreasonable one.\u201d Id., at 715.[35]Similarly, in these\ncases, the Hahns and Greens and their companies sincerely believe\nthat providing the insurance coverage demanded by the HHS\nregulations lies on the forbidden side of the line, and it is not\nfor us to say that their religious beliefs are mistaken or\ninsubstantial. Instead, our \u201cnarrow function .\u00a0.\u00a0. in\nthis context is to determine\u201d whether the line drawn reflects \u201can\nhonest conviction,\u201d id., at 716, and there is no dispute that it\ndoes.HHS nevertheless\ncompares these cases to decisions in which we rejected the argument\nthat the use of general tax revenue to subsidize the secular\nactivities of religious institutions violated the Free Exercise\nClause. See Tilton v. Richardson, 403 U.\u00a0S. 672, 689 (1971)\n(plurality); Board of Ed. of Central School Dist. No. 1 v. Allen,\n392 U.\u00a0S. 236 \u2013249 (1968). But in those cases, while the\nsubsidies were clearly contrary to the challengers\u2019 views on a\nsecular issue, namely, proper church-state relations, the\nchallengers never articulated a religious objection to the\nsubsidies. As we put it in Tilton, they were \u201cunable to identify\nany coercion directed at the practice or exercise of their\nreligious beliefs.\u201d 403 U.\u00a0S., at 689 (plurality opinion); see\nAllen, supra, at 249 (\u201c[A]ppellants have not contended that the New\nYork law in any way coerces them as individuals in the practice of\ntheir religion\u201d). Here, in contrast, the plaintiffs do assert that\nfunding the specific contraceptive methods at issue violates their\nreligious beliefs, and HHS does not question their sincerity.\nBecause the contraceptive mandate forces them to pay an enormous\nsum of money\u2014as much as $475 million per year in the case of Hobby\nLobby\u2014if they insist on providing insurance coverage in accordance\nwith their religious beliefs, the mandate clearly imposes a\nsubstantial burden on those beliefs.VSince the HHS\ncontraceptive mandate imposes a substantial burden on the exercise\nof religion, we must move on and decide whether HHS has shown that\nthe mandate both \u201c(1) is in furtherance of a compelling\ngovernmental interest; and (2) is the least restrictive means of\nfurthering that compelling governmental interest.\u201d 42\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72000bb\u20131(b).AHHS asserts that the\ncontraceptive mandate serves a variety of important interests, but\nmany of these are couched in very broad terms, such as promoting\n\u201cpublic health\u201d and \u201cgender equality.\u201d Brief for HHS in No. 13\u2013354,\nat 46, 49. RFRA, however, contemplates a \u201cmore focused\u201d inquiry: It\n\u201crequires the Government to demonstrate that the compelling\ninterest test is satisfied through application of the challenged\nlaw \u2018to the person\u2019\u2014the particular claimant whose sincere exercise\nof religion is being substantially burdened.\u201d O\u2019Centro, 546\nU.\u00a0S., at 430\u2013431 (quoting \u00a72000bb\u20131(b)). This requires us to\n\u201cloo[k] beyond broadly formulated interests\u201d and to \u201cscrutiniz[e]\nthe asserted harm of granting specific exemptions to particular\nreligious claimants\u201d\u2014in other words, to look to the marginal\ninterest in enforcing the contraceptive mandate in these cases. O\nCentro, supra, at 431.In addition to\nasserting these very broadly framed interests, HHS maintains that\nthe mandate serves a compelling interest in ensuring that all women\nhave access to all FDA-approved contraceptives without cost\nsharing. See Brief for HHS in No. 13\u2013354, at 14\u201315, 49; see Brief\nfor HHS in No. 13\u2013356, at 10, 48. Under our cases, women (and men)\nhave a constitutional right to obtain contraceptives, see Griswold\nv. Connecticut, 381 U.\u00a0S. 479 \u2013486 (1965), and HHS tells us\nthat \u201c[s]tudies have demonstrated that even moderate copayments for\npreventive services can deter patients from receiving those\nservices.\u201d Brief for HHS in No. 13\u2013354, at 50 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).The objecting parties\ncontend that HHS has not shown that the mandate serves a compelling\ngovernment interest, and it is arguable that there are features of\nACA that support that view. As we have noted, many employees\u2014those\ncovered by grandfathered plans and those who work for employers\nwith fewer than 50 employees\u2014may have no contraceptive coverage\nwithout cost sharing at all.HHS responds that many\nlegal requirements have exceptions and the existence of exceptions\ndoes not in itself indicate that the principal interest served by a\nlaw is not compelling. Even a compelling interest may be outweighed\nin some circumstances by another even weightier consideration. In\nthese cases, however, the interest served by one of the biggest\nexceptions, the exception for grandfathered plans, is simply the\ninterest of employers in avoiding the inconvenience of amending an\nexisting plan. Grandfathered plans are required \u201cto comply with a\nsubset of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s health reform provisions\u201d that\nprovide what HHS has described as \u201cparticularly significant\nprotections.\u201d 75 Fed. Reg. 34540 (2010). But the contraceptive\nmandate is expressly excluded from this subset. Ibid.We find it unnecessary\nto adjudicate this issue. We will assume that the interest in\nguaranteeing cost-free access to the four challenged contraceptive\nmethods is compelling within the meaning of RFRA, and we will\nproceed to consider the final prong of the RFRA test, i.e., whether\nHHS has shown that the contraceptive mandate is \u201cthe least\nrestrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental\ninterest.\u201d \u00a72000bb\u20131(b)(2).BThe\nleast-restrictive-means standard is exceptionally demanding, see\nCity of Boerne, 521 U.\u00a0S., at 532, and it is not satisfied\nhere. HHS has not shown that it lacks other means of achieving its\ndesired goal without imposing a substantial burden on the exercise\nof religion by the objecting parties in these cases. See\n\u00a7\u00a72000bb\u20131(a), (b) (requiring the Government to \u201cdemonstrat[e] that\napplication of [a substantial] burden to the person .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nis the least restrictive means of furthering [a] compelling\ngovernmental interest\u201d (emphasis added)).The most\nstraightforward way of doing this would be for the Government to\nassume the cost of providing the four contraceptives at issue to\nany women who are unable to obtain them under their\nhealth-insurance policies due to their employers\u2019 religious\nobjections. This would certainly be less restrictive of the\nplaintiffs\u2019 religious liberty, and HHS has not shown, see\n\u00a72000bb\u20131(b)(2), that this is not a viable alternative. HHS has not\nprovided any estimate of the average cost per employee of providing\naccess tothese contraceptives, two of which, according to the FDA,\nare designed primarily for emergency use. See Birth Control:\nMedicines to Help You, online at\nhttp://www.fda.gov/forconsumers/byaudience/forwomen/freepublications/ucm313215.htm.\nNor has HHS provided any statistics regarding the number of\nemployees who might be affected because they work for corporations\nlike Hobby Lobby, Conestoga, and Mardel. Nor has HHS told us that\nit is unable to provide such statistics. It seems likely, however,\nthat the cost of providing the forms of contraceptives at issue in\nthese cases (if not all FDA-approved contraceptives) would be minor\nwhen compared with the overall cost of ACA. According to one of the\nCongressional Budget Office\u2019s most recent forecasts, ACA\u2019s\ninsurance-coverage provisions will cost the Federal Government more\nthan $1.3 trillion through the next decade. See CBO, Updated\nEstimates of the Effects of the Insurance Coverage Provisions of\nthe Affordable Care Act, April 2014, p. 2.[36] If, as HHS tells us, providing all women\nwith cost-free access to all FDA-approved methods of contraception\nis a Government interest of the highest order, it is hard to\nunderstand HHS\u2019s argument that it cannot be required under RFRA to\npay anything in order to achieve this important goal.HHS contends that RFRA\ndoes not permit us to take this option into account because \u201cRFRA\ncannot be used to require creation of entirely new programs.\u201d Brief\nfor HHS in 13\u2013354, at 15.[37] But we see nothing in RFRA that supports this\nargument, and drawing the line between the \u201ccreation of an entirely\nnew program\u201d and the modification of an existing program (which\nRFRA surely allows) would be fraught with problems. We do not doubt\nthat cost may be an important factor in the least-restrictive-means\nanalysis, but both RFRA and its sister statute, RLUIPA, may in some\ncircumstances require the Government to expend additional funds to\naccommodate citizens\u2019 religious beliefs. Cf. \u00a72000cc\u20133(c) (RLUIPA:\n\u201c[T]his chapter may require a government to incur expenses in its\nown operations to avoid imposing a substantial burden on religious\nexercise.\u201d). HHS\u2019s view that RFRA can never require the Government\nto spend even a small amount reflects a judgment about the\nimportance of religious liberty that was not shared by the Congress\nthat enacted that law.In the end, however, we\nneed not rely on the option of a new, government-funded program in\norder to conclude that the HHS regulations fail the\nleast-restrictive-means test. HHS itself has demonstrated that it\nhas at its disposal an approach that is less restrictive than\nrequiring employers to fund contraceptive methods that violate\ntheir religious beliefs. As we explained above, HHS has already\nestablished an accommodation for nonprofit organizations with\nreligious objections. See supra, at 9\u201310, and nn.\u00a08\u20139. Under\nthat accommodation, the organization can self-certify that it\nopposes providing coverage for particular contraceptive services.\nSee 45 CFR \u00a7\u00a7147.131(b)(4), (c)(1); 26 CFR \u00a7\u00a754.9815\u20132713A(a)(4),\n(b). If the organization makes such a certification, the\norganization\u2019s insurance issuer or third-party administrator must\n\u201c[e]xpressly exclude contraceptive coverage from the group health\ninsurance coverage provided in connection with the group health\nplan\u201d and \u201c[p]rovide separate payments for any contraceptive\nservices required to be covered\u201d without imposing \u201cany cost-sharing\nrequirements .\u00a0.\u00a0. on the eligible organization, the\ngroup health plan, or plan participants or beneficiaries.\u201d 45 CFR\n\u00a7147.131(c)(2); 26 CFR \u00a754.9815\u20132713A(c)(2).[38]We do not decide today\nwhether an approach of this type complies with RFRA for purposes of\nall religious claims.[39] At\na minimum, however, it does not impinge on the plaintiffs\u2019\nreligious belief that providing insurance coverage for the\ncontraceptives at issue here violates their religion, and it serves\nHHS\u2019s stated interests equally well.[40]The principal dissent\nidentifies no reason why this accommodation would fail to protect\nthe asserted needs of women as effectively as the contraceptive\nmandate, and there is none.[41]\u00a0 Under the accommodation, the plaintiffs\u2019 female\nemployees would continue to receive contraceptive coverage without\ncost sharing for all FDA-approved contraceptives, and they would\ncontinue to \u201cface minimal logistical and administrative obstacles,\u201d\npost, at 28 (internal quotation marks omitted), because their\nemployers\u2019 insurers would be responsible for providing information\nand coverage, see, e.g., 45 CFR \u00a7\u00a7147.131(c)\u2013(d); cf. 26 CFR\n\u00a7\u00a754.9815\u20132713A(b), (d). Ironically, it is the dissent\u2019s approach\nthat would \u201c[i]mped[e] women\u2019s receipt of benefits by \u2018requiring\nthem to take steps to learn about, and to sign up for, a new\ngovernment funded and administered health benefit,\u2019\u00a0\u201d post, at\n28, because the dissent would effectively compel religious\nemployers to drop health-insurance coverage altogether, leaving\ntheir employees to find individual plans on government-run\nexchanges or elsewhere. This is indeed \u201cscarcely what Congress\ncontemplated.\u201d Ibid.CHHS and the principal\ndissent argue that a ruling in favor of the objecting parties in\nthese cases will lead to a flood of religious objections regarding\na wide variety of medical procedures and drugs, such as\nvaccinations and blood transfusions, but HHS has made no effort to\nsubstantiate this prediction.[42] HHS points to no evidence that insurance plans in\nexistence prior to the enactment of ACA excluded coverage for such\nitems. Nor has HHS provided evidence that any significant number of\nemployers sought exemption, on religious grounds, from any of ACA\u2019s\ncoverage requirements other than the contraceptive mandate.It is HHS\u2019s apparent\nbelief that no insurance-coverage mandate would violate RFRA\u2014no\nmatter how significantly it impinges on the religious liberties of\nemployers\u2014that would lead to intolerable consequences. Under HHS\u2019s\nview, RFRA would permit the Government to require all employers to\nprovide coverage for any medical procedure allowed by law in the\njurisdiction in question\u2014for instance, third-trimester abortions or\nassisted suicide. The owners of many closely held corporations\ncould not in good conscience provide such coverage, and thus HHS\nwould effectively exclude these people from full participation in\nthe economic life of the Nation. RFRA was enacted to prevent such\nan outcome.In any event, our\ndecision in these cases is concerned solely with the contraceptive\nmandate. Our decision should not be understood to hold that an\ninsurance-coverage mandate must necessarily fall if it conflicts\nwith an employer\u2019s religious beliefs. Other coverage requirements,\nsuch as immunizations, may be supported by different interests (for\nexample, the need to combat the spread of infectious diseases) and\nmay involve different arguments about the least restrictive means\nof providing them.The principal dissent\nraises the possibility that discrimination in hiring, for example\non the basis of race, might be cloaked as religious practice to\nescape legal sanction. See post, at 32\u201333. Our decision today\nprovides no such shield. The Government has a compelling interest\nin providing an equal opportunity to participate in the workforce\nwithout regard to race, and prohibitions on racial discrimination\nare precisely tailored to achieve that critical goal.HHS also raises for the\nfirst time in this Court the argument that applying the\ncontraceptive mandate to for-profit employers with sincere\nreligious objections is essential to the comprehensive\nhealth-insurance scheme that ACA establishes. HHS analogizes the\ncontraceptive mandate to the requirement to pay Social Security\ntaxes, which we upheld in Lee despite the religious objection of an\nemployer, but these cases are quite different. Our holding in Lee\nturned primarily on the special problems associated with a national\nsystem of taxation. We noted that \u201c[t]he obligation to pay the\nsocial security tax initially is not fundamentally different from\nthe obligation to pay income taxes.\u201d 455 U.\u00a0S., at 260. Based\non that premise, we explained that it was untenable to allow\nindividuals to seek exemptions from taxes based on religious\nobjections to particular Government expenditures: \u201cIf, for example,\na religious adherent believes war is a sin, and if a certain\npercentage of the federal budget can be identified as devoted to\nwar-related activities, such individuals would have a similarly\nvalid claim to be exempt from paying that percentage of the income\ntax.\u201d Ibid. We observed that \u201c[t]he tax system could not function\nif denominations were allowed to challenge the tax system because\ntax payments were spent in a manner that violates their religious\nbelief.\u201d Ibid.; see O Centro, 546 U. S., at 435.Lee was a\nfree-exercise, not a RFRA, case, but if the issue in Lee were\nanalyzed under the RFRA framework, the fundamental point would be\nthat there simply is no less restrictive alternative to the\ncategorical requirement to pay taxes. Because of the enormous\nvariety of government expenditures funded by tax dollars, allowing\ntax-payers to withhold a portion of their tax obligations on\nreligious grounds would lead to chaos. Recognizingexemptions from\nthe contraceptive mandate is very different. ACA does not create a\nlarge national pool of tax revenue for use in purchasing healthcare\ncoverage. Rather, individual employers like the plaintiffs purchase\ninsurance for their own employees. And contrary to the principal\ndissent\u2019s characterization, the employers\u2019 contributions do not\nnecessarily funnel into \u201cundifferentiated funds.\u201d Post, at 23. The\naccommodation established by HHS requires issuers to have a\nmechanism by which to \u201csegregate premium revenue collected from the\neligible organization from the monies used to provide payments for\ncontraceptive services.\u201d 45 CFR \u00a7147.131(c)(2)(ii). Recognizing a\nreligious accommodation under RFRA for particular coverage\nrequirements, therefore, does not threaten the viability of ACA\u2019s\ncomprehensive scheme in the way that recognizing religious\nobjections to particular expenditures from general tax revenues\nwould.[43]In its final pages, the\nprincipal dissent reveals that its fundamental objection to the\nclaims of the plaintiffs is an objection to RFRA itself. The\ndissent worries about forcing the federal courts to apply RFRA to a\nhost of claims made by litigants seeking a religious exemption from\ngenerally applicable laws, and the dissent expresses a desire to\nkeep the courts out of this business. See post, at 32\u201335. In making\nthis plea, the dissent reiterates a point made forcefully by the\nCourt in Smith. 494 U.\u00a0S., at 888\u2013889 (applying the Sherbert\ntest to all free-exercise claims \u201cwould open the prospect of\nconstitutionally required religious exemptions from civic\nobligations of almost every conceivable kind\u201d). But Congress, in\nenacting RFRA, took the position that \u201cthe compelling interest test\nas set forth in prior Federal court rulings is a workable test\nforstriking sensible balances between religious liberty and\ncompeting prior governmental interests.\u201d 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a72000bb(a)(5). The wisdom of Congress\u2019s judgment on this matter is\nnot our concern. Our responsibility is to enforce RFRA as written,\nand under the standard that RFRA prescribes, the HHS contraceptive\nmandate is unlawful.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*The contraceptive\nmandate, as applied to closely held corporations, violates RFRA.\nOur decision on that statutory question makes it unnecessary to\nreach the First Amendment claim raised by Conestoga and the\nHahns.The judgment of the\nTenth Circuit in No. 13\u2013354 is affirmed; the judgment of the Third\nCircuit in No. 13\u2013356 is reversed, and that case is remanded for\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.Notes1See also , at 8 (\u201cThe\nexemption sought by Hobby Lobby and Conestoga .\u00a0.\u00a0. would\ndeny [their employees] access to contraceptive coverage that the\nACA would otherwise secure\u201d)2The Act defines\n\u201cgovernment\u201d to include any \u201cdepartment\u201d or\u201cagency\u201d of the United\nStates. \u00a72000bb\u20132(1).3In v. , 521 U.\u00a0S.,\n507 (1997), we wrote that RFRA\u2019s \u201cleast restrictive means\nrequirement was not used in the pre-jurisprudence RFRA purported to\ncodify.\u201d , at 509. On this understanding of our pre- cases, RFRA\ndid more than merely restore the balancing test used in the line of\ncases; it provided even broader protection for religious liberty\nthan was available under those decisions.4See, , v., 441 F.\u00a03d\n96, 108 (CA2 2006); v., 290 F.\u00a03d 1210, 1220 (CA9\n2002).5The principal dissent\nappears to contend that this rule of construction should apply only\nwhen defining the \u201cexercise of religion\u201d in an RLUIPA case, but not\nin a RFRA case. See , at 11, n.\u00a010. That argument is plainly\nwrong. Under this rule of construction, the phrase \u201cexercise of\nreligion,\u201d as it appears in RLUIPA, must be interpreted broadly,\nand RFRA states that the same phrase, as used in RFRA, means\n\u201creligious exercis[e] as defined in [RLUIPA].\u201d \u20132(4). It\nnecessarily follows that the \u201cexercise of religion\u201d under RFRA must\nbe given the same broad meaning that applies under\nRLUIPA.6We will use \u201cBrief for\nHHS\u201d to refer to the Brief for Petitioners in No.\u00a013\u2013354 and\nthe Brief for Respondents in No. 13\u2013356.

See v. , 571 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2014).10While\nthe Government predicts that this number will decline over time,\nthe total number of Americans working for employers to whom the\ncontraceptive mandate does not apply is still substantial, and\nthere is no legal requirement that grandfathered plans ever be\nphased out.11Online at\nhttp\u00a0:\u00a0/\u00a0/\u00a0www\u00a0.\u00a0whitehouse\u00a0.\u00a0gov\u00a0/\u00a0files\u00a0/\u00a0documents\u00a0/\u00a0health\u00a0_reform_for_small_businesses.pdf.12Mennonite Church USA, Statement on\nAbortion, online\nathttp://www.mennoniteusa.org\u00a0/resource-center/resources\u00a0/statements\u00a0-and-resolutions/statement-on-abortion/.13The\nHahns and Conestoga also claimed that the contraceptive mandate\nviolates the and the Administrative Procedure Act, , but those\nclaims are not before us.14See,\n, WebMD Health News, New Morning-After Pill Ella Wins FDA Approval,\nonline at\nhttp://www.webmd.com/sex/birth-control/news/20100813/new-morning-after-pill-ella-wins-fda-approval.15The\nGreens operate Hobby Lobby and Mardel through a management trust,\nof which each member of the family serves as trustee. 723\nF.\u00a03d 1114, 1122 (CA10 2013).

For present purposes, it is unnecessary to\nadjudicate this dispute. Even if RFRA simply restored the status\nquo ante, there is no reason to believe, as HHS and the dissent\nseem to suggest, that the law was meant to be limited to situations\nthat fall squarely within the holdings of pre- cases.

Cf., ., v. , 608 F. 3d 717, 718\u2013719 (CA10 2010).29See,\n, v. , 90 F.\u00a03d 293, 296 (CA8 1996); v., 525 F.\u00a0Supp. 81,\n83\u201384 (ED\u00a0Mo. 1981);v. , 1996 WL 5320, *5 (CA9, Jan. 5,\n1996);v., 549 N.\u00a0W. 2d 819\u2013820 (Iowa 1996).30The\nprincipal dissent attaches significance to the fact that the\n\u201cSenate voted down [a] so-called \u2018conscience amendment,\u2019 which\nwould have enabled any employer or insurance provider to deny\ncoverage based on its asserted religious beliefs or moral\nconvictions.\u201d , at 6. The dissent would evidently glean from that\nvote an intent by the Senate to prohibit for-profit corporate\nemployers from refusing to offer contraceptive coverage for\nreligious reasons, regardless of whether the contraceptive mandate\ncould pass muster under RFRA\u2019s standards. But that is not the only\nplausible inference from the failed amendment\u2014or even the most\nlikely. For one thing, the text of the amendment was \u201cwritten so\nbroadly that it would allow any employer to deny any health service\nto any American for virtually any reason\u2014.\u201d 158 Cong. Rec. S1165\n(Mar. 1, 2012) (emphasis added). Moreover, the amendment would have\nauthorized a blanket exemption for religious or moral objectors; it\nwould not have subjected religious-based objections to the judicial\nscrutiny called for by RFRA, in which a court must consider not\nonly the burden of a requirement on religious adherents, but also\nthe government\u2019s interest and how narrowly tailored the requirement\nis. It is thus perfectly reasonable to believe that the amendment\nwas voted down because it extended more broadly than the\npre-existing protections of RFRA. And in any event, even if a\nrejected amendment to a bill could be relevant in other contexts,\nit surely cannot be relevant here, because any \u201cFederal statutory\nlaw adopted after November 16, 1993 is subject to [RFRA] unless\nsuch law such application by reference to [RFRA].\u201d \u20133(b) (emphasis\nadded). It is not plausible to find such an explicit reference in\nthe meager legislative history on which the dissent\nrelies.31Indeed, one of HHS\u2019s stated reasons\nfor establishing the religious accommodation was to \u201cencourag[e]\neligible organizations to to offer health coverage.\u201d 78 Fed. Reg.\n39882 (2013) (emphasis added).32Attempting to compensate for dropped\ninsurance by raising wages would also present administrative\ndifficulties. In order to provide full compensation for employees,\nthe companies would have to calculate the value to employees of the\nconvenience of retaining their employer-provided coverage and thus\nbeing spared the task of attempting to find and sign up for a\ncomparable plan on an exchange. And because some but not all of the\ncompanies\u2019 employees may qualify for subsidies on an exchange, it\nwould be nearly impossible to calculate a salary increase that\nwould accurately restore the status quo ante for all\nemployees.33This\nargument is not easy to square with the position taken by HHS in\nproviding exemptions from the contraceptive mandate for religious\nemployers, such as churches, that have the very same religious\nobjections as the Hahns and Greens and their companies. The\nconnection between what these religious employers would be required\nto do if not exempted (provide insurance coverage for particular\ncontraceptives) and the ultimate event that they find morally wrong\n(destruction of an embryo) is exactly the same. Nevertheless, as\ndiscussed, HHS and the Labor and Treasury Departments authorized\nthe exemption from the contraceptive mandate of group health plans\nof certain religious employers, and later expanded the exemption to\ninclude certain nonprofit organizations with religious objections\nto contraceptive coverage. 78 Fed. Reg. 39871. When this was done,\nthe Government made clear that its objective was to \u201cprotec[t]\u201d\nthese religious objectors \u201cfrom having to contract, arrange, pay,\nor refer for such coverage.\u201d . Those exemptions would be hard to\nunderstand if the plaintiffs\u2019 objections here were not\nsubstantial.34See,\n., Oderberg, The Ethics of Co-operation in Wrongdoing, in Modern\nMoral Philosophy 203\u2013228 (A. O\u2019Hear ed. 2004); T. Higgins, Man as\nMan: The Science and Art of Ethics 353, 355 (1949) (\u201cThe general\nprinciples governing cooperation\u201d in wrongdoing\u2014., \u201cphysical\nactivity (or its omission) by which a person assists in the evil\nact of another who is the principal agent\u201d\u2014\u201cpresent troublesome\ndifficulties in application\u201d); 1 H. Davis, Moral and Pastoral\nTheology 341 (1935) (Cooperation occurs \u201cwhen A helps B to\naccomplish an external act by an act that is not sinful, and\nwithout approving of what B does\u201d).35The\nprincipal dissent makes no effort to reconcile its view about the\nsubstantial-burden requirement with our decision in .36Online at\nhttp://cbo.gov/publication/45231.37In a\nrelated argument, HHS appears to maintain that a plaintiff cannot\nprevail on a RFRA claim that seeks an exemption from a legal\nobligation requiring the plaintiff to confer benefits on third\nparties. Nothing in the text of RFRA or its basic purposes supports\ngiving the Government an entirely free hand to impose burdens on\nreligious exercise so long as those burdens confer a benefit on\nother individuals. It is certainly true that in applying RFRA\n\u201ccourts must take adequate account of the burdens a requested\naccommodation may impose on nonbeneficiaries.\u201d v., (applying\nRLUIPA). That consideration will often inform the analysis of the\nGovernment\u2019s compelling interest and the availability of a less\nrestrictive means of advancing that interest. But it could not\nreasonably be maintained that any burden on religious exercise, no\nmatter how onerous and no matter how readily the government\ninterest could be achieved through alternative means, is\npermissible under RFRA so long as the relevant legal obligation\nrequires the religious adherent to confer a benefit on third\nparties. Otherwise, for example, the Government could decide that\nall supermarkets must sell alcohol for the convenience of customers\n(and thereby exclude Muslims with religious objections from owning\nsupermarkets), or it could decide that all restaurants must remain\nopen on Saturdays to give employees an opportunity to earn tips\n(and thereby exclude Jews with religious objections from owning\nrestaurants). By framing any Government regulation as benefiting a\nthird party, the Government could turn all regulations into\nentitlements to which nobody could object on religious grounds,\nrendering RFRA meaningless. In any event, our decision in these\ncases need not result in any detrimental effect on any third party.\nAs we explain, see , at 43\u201344, the Government can readily arrange\nfor other methods of providing contraceptives, without cost\nsharing, to employees who are unable to obtain them under their\nhealth-insurance plans due to their employers\u2019 religious\nobjections.38HHS\nhas concluded that insurers that insure eligible employers opting\nout of the contraceptive mandate and that are required to pay for\ncontraceptive coverage under the accommodation will not experience\nan increase in costs because the \u201ccosts of providing contraceptive\ncoverage are balanced by cost savings from lower pregnancy-related\ncosts and from improvements in women\u2019s health.\u201d 78 Fed. Reg. 39877.\nWith respect to self-insured plans, the regulations establish a\nmechanism for the eligible employers\u2019 third-party administrators to\nobtain a compensating reduction in the fee paid by insurers to\nparticipate in the federally facilitated exchanges. HHS believes\nthat this system will not have a material effect on the funding of\nthe exchanges because the \u201cpayments for contraceptive services will\nrepresent only a small portion of total [federally facilitated\nexchange] user fees.\u201d at 39882; see 26 CFR\n\u00a754.9815\u20132713A(b)(3).39See\nn.\u00a09, .40The\nprincipal dissent faults us for being \u201cnoncommital\u201d in refusing to\ndecide a case that is not before us here. , at 30.The less\nre-strictive approach we describe accommodates the religious\nbeliefs as-serted in these cases, and that is the only question we\nare permittedto address.41In\nthe principal dissent\u2019s view, the Government has not had a fair\nopportunity to address this accommodation, , at 30. n. 27, but the\nGovernment itself apparently believes that when it \u201cprovides an\nexception to a general rule for secular reasons (or for only\ncertain religious reasons), [it] must explain why extending a\ncomparable exception to a specific plaintiff for religious reasons\nwould undermine its compelling interests.\u201d Brief for the United\nStates as in v., No.\u00a013\u20136827, p.\u00a010, now pending before\nthe Court.42Cf.\n42\u00a0U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71396s (Federal \u201cprogram for\ndistribution of pediatric vaccines\u201d for some uninsured and\nunderinsured children).43HHS\nhighlights certain statements in the opinion in that it regards as\nsupporting its position in these cases. In particular, HHS notes\nthe statement that \u201c[w]hen followers of a particular sect enter\ninto commercial activity as a matter of choice, the limits they\naccept on their own conduct as a matter of conscience and faith are\nnot to be superimposed on the statutory schemes which are binding\non others in that activity.\u201d 455 U.\u00a0S., at 261. was a free\nexercise, not a RFRA, case, and the statement to which HHS points,\nif taken at face value, is squarely inconsistent with the plain\nmeaning of RFRA. Under RFRA, when followers of a particular\nreligion choose to enter into commercial activity, the Government\ndoes not have a free hand in imposing obligations that\nsubstantially burden their exercise of religion. Rather, the\nGovernment can impose such a burden only if the strict RFRA test is\nmet.",
