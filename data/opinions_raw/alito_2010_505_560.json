    "text": "OPINION OF THE COURTHAMILTON V. LANNING560 U. S. ____ (2010)SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESNO. 08-998JAN HAMILTON, CHAPTER 13 TRUSTEE, PETITIONERv.STEPHANIE KAY LANNINGon writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the tenth circuit[June 7, 2010]Justice Alito delivered the\nopinion of the Court.Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code\nprovides bankruptcy protection to \u201cindividual[s] with regular\nincome\u201d whose debts fall within statutory limits. 11 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7\u00a7101(30), 109(e). Unlike debtors who file under Chapter 7 and must\nliquidate their nonexempt assets in order to pay creditors, see\n\u00a7\u00a7704(a)(1), 726, Chapter 13 debtors are permitted to keep their\nproperty, but they must agree to a court-approved plan under which\nthey pay creditors out of their future income, see \u00a7\u00a71306(b), 1321,\n1322(a)(1), 1328(a). A bankruptcy trustee oversees the filing and\nexecution of a Chapter 13 debtor\u2019s plan. \u00a71322(a)(1); see also 28\nU. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7586(a)(3).Section 1325 of Title 11 specifies\ncircumstances under which a bankruptcy court \u201cshall\u201d and \u201cmay not\u201d\nconfirm a plan. \u00a71325(a),(b). If an unsecured creditor or the\nbankruptcy trustee objects to confirmation, \u00a71325(b)(1) requires\nthe debtor either to pay unsecured creditors in full or to pay all\n\u201cprojected disposable income\u201d to be received by the debtor over the\nduration of the plan.We granted certiorari to decide how a\nbankruptcy court should calculate a debtor\u2019s \u201cprojected disposable\nincome.\u201d Some lower courts have taken what the parties term the\n\u201cmechanical approach,\u201d while most have adopted what has been called\nthe \u201cforward-looking approach.\u201d We hold that the \u201cforward-looking\napproach\u201d is correct.IAs previously noted, \u00a71325\nprovides that if a trustee or an unsecured creditor objects to a\nChapter 13 debtor\u2019s plan, a bankruptcy court may not approve the\nplan unless it provides for the full repayment of unsecured claims\nor \u201cprovides that all of the debtor\u2019s projected disposable income\nto be received\u201d over the duration of the plan \u201cwill be applied to\nmake payments\u201d in accordance with the terms of the plan. 11 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a71325(b)(1); see also \u00a71325(b)(1) (2000 ed.). Before the\nenactment of the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer\nProtection Act of 2005 (BAPCPA), 119 Stat. 23, the Bankruptcy Code\n(Code) loosely defined \u201cdisposable income\u201d as \u201cincome which is\nreceived by the debtor and which is not reasonably necessary to be\nexpended\u201d for the \u201cmaintenance or support of the debtor,\u201d for\nqualifying charitable contributions, or for business expenditures.\n\u00a71325(b)(2)(A), (B).The Code did not define the term\n\u201cprojected disposable income,\u201d and in most cases, bankruptcy courts\nused a mechanical approach in calculating projected disposable\nincome. That is, they first multiplied monthly income by the number\nof months in the plan and then determined what portion of the\nresult was \u201cexcess\u201d or \u201cdisposable.\u201d See 2 K. Lundin, Chapter 13\nBankruptcy \u00a7164.1, p. 164\u20131, and n.\u00a04 (3d ed. 2000)\n(hereinafter Lundin (2000 ed.)) (citing cases).In exceptional cases, however, bankruptcy\ncourts took into account foreseeable changes in a debtor\u2019s income\nor expenses. SeeIn\u00a0re Heath, 182 B.\u00a0R. 557,\n559\u2013561 (Bkrtcy. App. Panel CA9 1995);In\u00a0re\nRichardson, 283 B.\u00a0R. 783, 799 (Bkrtcy. Ct. Kan. 2002);\nTr. of Oral Arg. 7. Accord, 1 Lundin \u00a735.10, at 35\u201314 (2000 ed.)\n(\u201cThe debtor should take some care to project estimated future\nincome on Schedule I to include anticipated increases or decreases\n[in income] so that the schedule will be consistent with any\nevidence of income the debtor would offer at a contested\nconfirmation hearing\u201d).BAPCPA left the term \u201cprojected disposable\nincome\u201d undefined but specified in some detail how \u201cdisposable\nincome\u201d is to be calculated. \u201cDisposable income\u201d is now defined as\n\u201ccurrent monthly income received by the debtor\u201d less \u201camounts\nreasonably necessary to be expended\u201d for the debtor\u2019s maintenance\nand support, for qualifying charitable contributions, and for\nbusiness expenditures. \u00a71325(b)(2)(A)(i) and (ii) (2006 ed.).\n\u201cCurrent monthly income,\u201d in turn, is calculated by averaging the\ndebtor\u2019s monthly income during what the parties refer to as the\n6-month look-back period, which generally consists of the six full\nmonths preceding the filing of the bankruptcy petition. See\n\u00a7101(10A)(A)(i).[Footnote 1]\nThe phrase \u201camounts reasonably necessary to be expended\u201d in\n\u00a71325(b)(2) is also newly defined. For a debtor whose income is\nbelow the median for his or her State, the phrase includes the full\namount needed for \u201cmaintenance or support,\u201d see \u00a71325(b)(2)(A)(i),\nbut for a debtor with income that exceeds the state median, only\ncertain specified expenses are included,[Footnote 2] see \u00a7\u00a7707(b)(2), 1325(b)(3)(A).IIARespondent had $36,793.36 in\nunsecured debt when she filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection\nin October 2006. In the six months before her filing, she received\na one-time buyout from her former employer, and this payment\ngreatly inflated her gross income for April 2006 (to $11,990.03)\nand for May 2006 (to $15,356.42). App. 84, 107. As a result of\nthese payments, respondent\u2019s current monthly income, as averaged\nfrom April through October 2006, was $5,343.70\u2014a figure that\nexceeds the median income for a family of one in Kansas. Seeid., at 78. Respondent\u2019s monthly expenses, calculated\npursuant to \u00a7707(b)(2), were $4,228.71.Id., at 83. She\nreported a monthly \u201cdisposable income\u201d of $1,114.98 on Form 22C.Ibid.On the form used for reporting\nmonthly income (Schedule I), she reported income from her new job\nof $1,922 per month\u2014which is below the state median.Id.,\nat 66; see alsoid., at 78. On the form used for reporting\nmonthly expenses (Schedule J), she reported actual monthly expenses\nof $1,772.97.Id., at 68. Subtracting the Schedule J\nfigure from the Schedule I figure resulted in monthly disposable\nincome of $149.03.Respondent filed a plan that would have\nrequired her to pay $144 per month for 36 months. Seeid.,\nat 93. Petitioner, a private Chapter 13 trustee, objected to\nconfirmation of the plan because the amount respondent proposed to\npay was less than the full amount of the claims against her, see\n\u00a71325(b)(1)(A), and because, in petitioner\u2019s view, respondent was\nnot committing all of her \u201cprojected disposable income\u201d to the\nrepayment of creditors, see \u00a71325(b)(1)(B). According to\npetitioner, the proper way to calculate projected disposable income\nwas simply to multiply disposable income, as calculated on Form\n22C, by the number of months in the commitment period. Employing\nthis mechanical approach, petitioner calculated that creditors\nwould be paid in full if respondent made monthly payments of $756\nfor a period of 60 months.Id., at 108. There is no\ndispute that respondent\u2019s actual income was insufficient to make\npayments in that amount. Tr. of Oral Arg. 3\u20134.BThe Bankruptcy Court endorsed\nrespondent\u2019s proposed monthly payment of $144 but required a\n60-month plan period. No. 06\u201341037 etc., 2007 WL 1451999, *8\n(Bkrtcy. Ct. Kan. 2007). The court agreed with the majority view\nthat the word \u201cprojected\u201d in \u00a71325(b)(1)(B) requires courts \u201cto\nconsider at confirmation the debtor\u2019sactualincome as it\nwas reported on Schedule I.\u201dId., at *5 (emphasis added).\nThis conclusion was warranted by the text of \u00a71325(b)(1), the\nBankruptcy Court reasoned, and was necessary to avoid the absurd\nresult of denying bankruptcy protection to individuals with\ndeteriorating finances in the six months before filing.Ibid.Petitioner appealed to the Tenth\nCircuit Bankruptcy Appellate Panel, which affirmed. 380 B.\u00a0R.\n17, 19 (2007). The Panel noted that, although Congress redefined\n\u201cdisposable income\u201d in 2005, it chose not to alter the pre-existing\nterm \u201cprojected disposable income.\u201dId., at 24. Thus, the\nPanel concluded, there was no reason to believe that Congress\nintended to alter the pre-BAPCPA practice under which bankruptcy\ncourts determined projected disposable income by reference to\nSchedules I and J but considered other evidence when there was\nreason to believe that the schedules did not reflect a debtor\u2019s\nactual ability to pay.Ibid.The Tenth Circuit affirmed. 545 F.\u00a03d\n1269, 1270 (2008). According to the Tenth Circuit, a court, in\ncalculating \u201cprojected disposable income,\u201d should begin with the\n\u201cpresumption\u201d that the figure yielded by the mechanical approach is\ncorrect, but the Court concluded that this figure may be rebutted\nby evidence of a substantial change in the debtor\u2019s circumstances.Id., at 1278\u20131279.This petition followed, and we granted\ncertiorari. 558 U. S. ___ (2009).IIIAThe parties differ sharply in\ntheir interpretation of \u00a71325\u2019s reference to \u201cprojected disposable\nincome.\u201d Petitioner, advocating the mechanical approach, contends\nthat \u201cprojected disposable income\u201d means past average monthly\ndisposable income multiplied by the number of months in a debtor\u2019s\nplan. Respondent, who favors the forward-looking approach, agrees\nthat the method outlined by petitioner should be determinative in\nmost cases, but she argues that in exceptional cases, where\nsignificant changes in a debtor\u2019s financial circumstances are known\nor virtually certain, a bankruptcy court has discretion to make an\nappropriate adjustment. Respondent has the stronger argument.First, respondent\u2019s argument is\nsupported by the ordinary meaning of the term \u201cprojected.\u201d \u201cWhen\nterms used in a statute are undefined, we give them their ordinary\nmeaning.\u201dAsgrow Seed Co.v.Winterboer,513 U. S. 179, 187\n(1995). Here, the term \u201cprojected\u201d is not defined, and in ordinary\nusage future occurrences are not \u201cprojected\u201d based on the\nassumption that the past will necessarily repeat itself. For\nexample, projections concerning a company\u2019s future sales or the\nfuture cash flow from a license take into account anticipated\nevents that may change past trends. See,e.g.,Tellabs, Inc.v.Makor Issues & Rights, Ltd.,551 U. S. 308,\n316 (2007) (describing adjustments to \u201cprojected sales\u201d in light of\nfalling demand);Innovair Aviation, Ltd.v.United\nStates, 83 Fed. Cl. 498, 502, 504\u2013506 (2008) (calculating\nprojected cash flow and noting that past sales are \u201cnot necessarily\nthe number of sales\u201d that will be made in the future). On the night\nof an election, experts do not \u201cproject\u201d the percentage of the\nvotes that a candidate will receive by simply assuming that the\ncandidate will get the same percentage as he or she won in the\nfirst few reporting precincts. And sports analysts do not project\nthat a team\u2019s winning percentage at the end of a new season will be\nthe same as the team\u2019s winning percentage last year or the team\u2019s\nwinning percentage at the end of the first month of competition.\nWhile a projection takes past events into account, adjustments are\noften made based on other factors that may affect the final\noutcome. SeeIn re Kibbe, 361 B.\u00a0R. 302, 312,\nn.\u00a09 (Bkrtcy. App. Panel CA1 2007) (contrasting \u201cmultiplied,\u201d\nwhich \u201crequires only mathematical acumen,\u201d with \u201cprojected,\u201d which\nrequires \u201cmathematic acumen adjusted by deliberation and\ndiscretion\u201d).Second, the word \u201cprojected\u201d appears in many\nfederal statutes, yet Congress rarely has used it to mean simple\nmultiplication. For example, the Agricultural Adjustment Act of\n1938 defined \u201cprojected national yield,\u201d \u201cprojected county yield,\u201d\nand \u201cprojected farm yield\u201d as entailing historical averages\n\u201cadjusted for abnormal weather conditions,\u201d \u201ctrends in yields,\u201d and\n\u201cany significant changes in production practices.\u201d 7 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a71301(b)(8)(B), (13)(J), (K).[Footnote 3]By contrast, we need look no further than the\nBankruptcy Code to see that when Congress wishes to mandate simple\nmultiplication, it does so unambiguously\u2014most commonly by using the\nterm \u201cmultiplied.\u201d See,e.g., 11 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71325(b)(3)\n(\u201ccurrent monthly income, when multiplied by 12\u201d); \u00a7\u00a7704(b)(2),\n707(b)(6), (7)(A) (same); \u00a7707(b)(2)(A)(i), (B)(iv) (\u201cmultiplied by\n60\u201d). Accord, 2 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a758(b)(1)(B) (\u201cmultiplied by the\nnumber of months in such year\u201d); 5 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a78415(a)\n(\u201cmultiplied by such individual\u2019s total service\u201d); 42 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7403(f)(3) (\u201cmultiplied by the number of months in such year\u201d).Third, pre-BAPCPA case law points in favor of\nthe \u201cforward-looking\u201d approach. Prior to BAPCPA, the general rule\nwas that courts would multiply a debtor\u2019s current monthly income by\nthe number of months in the commitment period as the first step in\ndetermining projected disposable income. See,e.g.,In\nre Killough, 900 F. 2d 61, 62\u201363 (CA5 1990)(per\ncuriam);In re Anderson, 21 F. 3d 355, 357 (CA9\n1994);In re Solomon, 67 F. 3d 1128, 1132 (CA4 1995). See\n2 Lundin \u00a7164.1, at 164\u20131 (2000 ed.) (\u201cMost courts focus on the\ndebtor\u2019s current income and extend current income (and\nexpenditures) over the life of the plan to calculate projected\ndisposable income\u201d). But courts also had discretion to account for\nknown or virtually certain changes in the debtor\u2019s income. SeeHeath, 182 B.\u00a0R., at 559\u2013561;Richardson,\n283 B.\u00a0R., at 799;In\u00a0re James, 260 B.\u00a0R.\n498, 514\u2013515 (Bkrtcy. Ct. Idaho 2001);In\u00a0re Jobe,\n197 B.\u00a0R. 823, 826\u2013827 (Bkrtcy. Ct. WD Tex. 1996);In\u00a0re Crompton, 73 B.\u00a0R. 800, 808 (Bkrtcy. Ct.\nED Pa. 1987); see alsoIn re Schyma, 68 B. R. 52, 63\n(Bkrtcy. Ct. Minn. 1985) (\u201c[T]he prospect of dividends . . . is not\nso certain as to require Debtors or the Court to consider them as\nregular or disposable income\u201d);In\u00a0re Krull, 54\nB.\u00a0R. 375, 378 (Bkrtcy. Ct. Colo. 1985) (\u201cSince there are no\nchanges in income which can be clearly foreseen, the Court must\nsimply multiply the debtor\u2019s current disposable income by 36 in\norder to determine his \u2018projected\u2019 income\u201d).[Footnote 4] This judicial discretion was well\ndocumented in contemporary bankruptcy treatises. See 8 Collier on\nBankruptcy \u00b61325.08[4][a], p. 1325\u201350 (15th ed. rev. 2004)\n(hereinafter Collier) (\u201cAs a practical matter,unless there are\nchanges which can be clearly foreseen, the court must simply\nmultiply the debtor\u2019s known monthly income by 36 and determine\nwhether the amount to be paid under the plan equals or exceeds that\namount\u201d (emphasis added)); 3 W. Norton, Bankruptcy Law and Practice\n\u00a775.10, p. 64 (1991) (\u201cIt has been held that the court should focus\nupon present monthly income and expenditures and,absent\nextraordinary circumstances, project these current amounts\nover the life of the plan to determine projected disposable income\u201d\n(emphasis added)); 2 Lundin \u00a7164.1, at 164\u201328 to 164\u201331 (2000 ed.)\n(describing how reported decisions treated anticipated changes in\nincome, particularly where such changes were \u201ctoo speculative to be\nprojected\u201d); see alsoIn\u00a0re Greer, 388 B.\u00a0R.\n889, 892 (Bkrtcy.

Accord, 8 Collier\n\u00b61325.08[4][b], at 1325\u201360 (15th ed. rev. 2007) (\u201cAs with the\nincome side of the budget, the court must simply use the debtor\u2019s\ncurrent expenses,unless a change in them is virtually\ncertain\u201d (emphasis added)). Indeed, petitioner concedes that\ncourts possessed this discretion prior to BAPCPA. Tr. of Oral Arg.\n7.Pre-BAPCPA bankruptcy practice is telling\nbecause we \u201c\u00a0\u2018will not read the Bankruptcy Code to erode past\nbankruptcy practice absent a clear indication that Congress\nintended such a departure.\u2019\u00a0\u201dTravelers Casualty &\nSurety Co. of Americav.Pacific Gas & Elec. Co.,549 U. S. 443,\n454 (2007);Lamiev.United States Trustee,540 U. S. 526,\n539 (2004);Cohenv.de la Cruz,523 U. S. 213, 221\n(1998); see alsoGroganv.Garner,498 U. S. 279, 290\n(1991);Kellyv.Robinson,479 U. S. 36, 47 (1986).\nCongress did not amend the term \u201cprojected disposable income\u201d in\n2005, and pre-BAPCPA bankruptcy practice reflected a widely\nacknowledged and well-documented view that courts may take into\naccount known or virtually certain changes to debtors\u2019 income or\nexpenses when projecting disposable income. In light of this\nhistorical practice, we would expect that, had Congress intended\nfor \u201cprojected\u201d to carry a specialized\u2014and indeed, unusual\u2014meaning\nin Chapter 13, Congress would have said so expressly. Cf.,e.g., 26 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7279(c)(3)(A), (B) (expressly\ndefining \u201cprojected earnings\u201d as reflecting a 3-year historical\naverage).BThe mechanical approach also\nclashes repeatedly with the terms of 11 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71325.First, \u00a71325(b)(1)(B)\u2019s reference\nto projected disposable income \u201cto be received in the applicable\ncommitment period\u201d strongly favors the forward-looking approach.\nThere is no dispute that respondent would in fact receive far less\nthan $756 per month in disposable income during the plan period, so\npetitioner\u2019s projection does not accurately reflect \u201cincome to be\nreceived\u201d during that period. SeeIn re Nowlin, 576 F. 3d\n258, 263 (CA5 2009). The mechanical approach effectively reads this\nphrase out of the statute when a debtor\u2019s current disposable income\nis substantially higher than the income that the debtor predictably\nwill receive during the plan period. SeeKawaauhauv.Geiger,523\nU. S. 57, 62 (1998) (\u201c[W]e are hesitant to adopt an\ninterpretation of a congressional enactment which renders\nsuperfluous another portion of that same law\u201d (internal quotation\nmarks omitted)).Second, \u00a71325(b)(1) directs courts to\ndetermine projected disposable income \u201cas of the effective date of\nthe plan,\u201d which is the date on which the plan is confirmed and\nbecomes binding, see \u00a71327(a). Had Congress intended for projected\ndisposable income to be nothing more than a multiple of disposable\nincome in all cases, we see no reason why Congress would not have\nrequired courts to determine that value as of thefilingdate of the plan. See Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 3015(b) (requiring\nthat a plan be filed within 14 days of the filing of a petition),\nonline at\nhttp://www.uscourts.gov/RulesAndPolicies/FederalRulemaking/Overview/BankruptcyRules.aspx\n(all Internet materials as visited June 3, 2010, and available in\nClerk of Court\u2019s case file). In the very next section of the Code,\nfor example, Congress specified that a debtor shall commence\npayments \u201cnot later than 30 days after thedate of the filing\nof the plan.\u201d \u00a71326(a)(1) (emphasis added). Congress\u2019 decision\nto require courts to measure projected disposable income \u201cas of theeffectivedate of the plan\u201d is more consistent with the\nview that Congress expected courts to consider postfiling\ninformation about the debtor\u2019s financial circumstances. See 545\nF.\u00a03d, at 1279 (\u201c[D]etermining whether or not a debtor has\ncommitted all projected disposable income to repayment of the\nunsecured creditors \u2018as of the effective date of the plan\u2019 suggests\nconsideration of the debtor\u2019s actual financial circumstances as of\nthe effective date of the plan\u201d).Third, the requirement that projected\ndisposable income \u201cwill be applied to make payments\u201d is most\nnaturally read to contemplate that the debtor will actually pay\ncreditors in the calculated monthly amounts. \u00a71325(b)(1)(B). But\nwhen, as of the effective date of a plan, the debtor lacks the\nmeans to do so, this language is rendered a hollow command.CThe arguments advanced in favor\nof the mechanical approach are unpersuasive. Noting that the Code\nnow provides a detailed and precise definition of \u201cdisposable\nincome,\u201d proponents of the mechanical approach maintain that any\ndeparture from this method leaves that definition \u201c\u00a0\u2018with no\napparent purpose.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIn\u00a0re Kagenveama, 541 F. 3d\n868, 873 (CA9 2008). This argument overlooks the important role\nthat the statutory formula for calculating \u201cdisposable income\u201d\nplays under the forward-looking approach. As the Tenth Circuit\nrecognized in this case, a court taking the forward-looking\napproach should begin by calculating disposable income, and in most\ncases, nothing more is required. It is only in unusual cases that a\ncourt may go further and take into account other known or virtually\ncertain information about the debtor\u2019s future income or\nexpenses.[Footnote 5]Petitioner faults the Tenth\nCircuit for referring to a rebuttable \u201cpresumption\u201d that the figure\nproduced by the mechanical approach accurately represents a\ndebtor\u2019s \u201cprojected disposable income.\u201d See 545 F.\u00a03d, at\n1278\u20131279. Petitioner notes that the Code makes no reference to any\nsuch presumption but that related Code provisions expressly create\nother rebuttable presumptions. See \u00a7707(b)(2)(A)(i) and (B)(i). He\nthus suggests that the Tenth Circuit improperly supplemented the\ntext of the Code.The Tenth Circuit\u2019s analysis, however, simply\nheeds the ordinary meaning of the term \u201cprojected.\u201d As noted, a\nperson making a projection uses past occurrences as a starting\npoint, and that is precisely what the Tenth Circuit prescribed.\nSee,e.g.,Nowlin,supra, at 260,\n263.Petitioner argues that only the mechanical\napproach is consistent with \u00a71129(a)(15)(B), which refers to\n\u201cprojected disposable income of the debtor (as defined in section\n1325(b)(2)).\u201d This cross-reference, petitioner argues, shows that\nCongress intended for the term \u201cprojected disposable income\u201d to\nincorporate, presumably in all contexts, the defined term\n\u201cdisposable income.\u201d It is evident that \u00a71129(a)(15)(B) refers to\nthe defined term \u201cdis- posable income,\u201d see \u00a71325(b)(2), but that\nfact offers no insight into the meaning of the word \u201cprojected\u201d in\n\u00a7\u00a71129(a)(15)(B) and 1325(b)(1)(B). We fail to see how that word\nacquires a specialized meaning as a result of this\ncross-reference\u2014particularly where both \u00a7\u00a71129(a)(15)(B) and\n1325(b)(1)(B) refer to projected disposable income \u201cto be received\u201d\nduring the relevant period. Seesupra, at 11.Petitioner also notes that \u00a7707 allows courts\nto take \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d into consideration, but that\n\u00a71325(b)(3) incorporates \u00a7707 only with respect to calculating\nexpenses. SeeIn\u00a0re Wilson, 397 B.\u00a0R. 299,\n314\u2013315 (Bkrtcy. Ct. MDNC 2008). Thus, he argues, a \u201cspecial\ncircumstances\u201d exception should not be inferred with respect to the\ndebtor\u2019s income. We decline to infer from \u00a71325\u2019s incorporation of\n\u00a7707 that Congress intended to eliminate,sub silentio,\nthe discretion that courts previously exercised when projecting\ndisposable income to account for known or virtually certain\nchanges. Accord,In\u00a0reLiverman, 383 B. R.\n604, 613, and n.\u00a015 (Bkrtcy. Ct. NJ 2008).DIn cases in which a debtor\u2019s\ndisposable income during the 6-month look-back period is either\nsubstantially lower or higher than the debtor\u2019s disposable income\nduring the plan period, the mechanical approach would produce\nsenseless results that we do not think Congress intended. In cases\nin which the debtor\u2019s disposable income is higher during the plan\nperiod, the mechanical approach would deny creditors payments that\nthe debtor could easily make. And where, as in the present case,\nthe debtor\u2019s disposable income during the plan period is\nsubstantially lower, the mechanical approach would deny the\nprotection of Chapter 13 to debtors who meet the chapter\u2019s main\neligibility requirements. Here, for example, respondent is an\n\u201cindividual whose income is sufficiently stable and regular\u201d to\nallow her \u201cto make payments under a plan,\u201d \u00a7101(30), and her debts\nfall below the limits set out in \u00a7109(e). But if the mechanical\napproach were used, she could not file a confirmable plan. Under\n\u00a71325(a)(6), a plan cannot be confirmed unless \u201cthe debtor will be\nable to make all payments under the plan and comply with the plan.\u201d\nAnd as petitioner concedes, respondent could not possibly make the\npayments that the mechanical approach prescribes.In order to avoid or at least to\nmitigate the harsh results that the mechanical approach may produce\nfor debtors, petitioner advances several possible escape\nstrategies. He proposes no comparable strategies for creditors\nharmed by the mechanical approach, and in any event none of the\nmaneuvers that he proposes for debtors is satisfactory.1Petitioner first suggests that a\ndebtor may delay filing a petition so as to place any extraordinary\nincome outside the 6-month look-back period. We see at least two\nproblems with this proposal.First, delay is often not a\nviable option for a debtor sliding into bankruptcy.\u201cPotential Chapter 13 debtors\ntypically find a lawyer\u2019s office when they are one step from\nfinancial Armageddon: There is a foreclosure sale of the debtor\u2019s\nhome the next day; the debtor\u2019s only car was mysteriously\nrepossessed in the dark of last night; a garnishment has reduced\nthe debtor\u2019s take-home pay below the ordinary requirements of food\nand rent. Instantaneous relief is ex- pected, if not necessary.\u201d K.\nLundin & W. Brown, Chapter 13 Bankruptcy \u00a73.1[2] (4th ed.\nrev.2009),\nhttp:\u00a0//\u00a0www.ch13online.com\u00a0/\u00a0Subscriber\u00a0/\u00a0Chapter\u00a0_13_\nBankruptcy_4th_Lundin_Brown.htm.See alsoid., \u00a738.1 (\u201cDebtor\u2019s counsel\noften has little discretion when to file the Chapter 13 case\u201d).Second, even when a debtor is able to delay\nfiling a petition, such delay could be risky if it gives the\nappearance of bad faith. See 11 U. S. C. \u00a71325(a)(7) (requiring, as\na condition of confirmation, that \u201cthe action of the debtor in\nfiling the petition was in good faith\u201d); see also,e.g.,In\u00a0re Myers, 491 F.\u00a03d 120, 125 (CA3 2007)\n(citing \u201c\u00a0\u2018the timing of the petition\u2019\u00a0\u201d as a factor to\nbe considered in assessing a debtor\u2019s compliance with the\ngood-faith requirement). Accord,Neufeldv.Freeman, 794 F. 2d 149, 153 (CA4 1986) (a debtor\u2019s\nprepetition conduct may inform the court\u2019s good-faith inquiry).2Petitioner next argues that a\ndebtor with unusually high income during the 6 months prior to the\nfiling of a petition, could seek leave to delay filing a schedule\nof current income (Schedule I) and then ask the bankruptcy court to\nexercise its authority under \u00a7101(10A)(A)(ii) to select a 6-month\nperiod that is more representative of the debtor\u2019s future\ndisposable income. We see little merit in this convoluted strategy.\nIf the Code required the use of the mechanical approach in all\ncases, this strategy would improperly undermine what the Code\ndemands. And if, as we believe, the Code does not insist upon rigid\nadherence to the mechanical approach in all cases, this strategy is\nnot needed. In any event, even if this strategy were allowed, it\nwould not help all debtors whose disposable income during the plan\nperiod is sharply lower than their previous disposable\nincome.[Footnote 6]3Petitioner suggests that a debtor\ncan dismiss the petition and refile at a later, more favorable\ndate. But petitioner offers only the tepid assurance that courts\n\u201cgenerally\u201d do not find this practice to be abusive. Brief for\nPetitioner 53. This questionable stratagem plainly circumvents the\nstatutory limits on a court\u2019s ability to shift the look-back\nperiod, seesupra, at 16, and n.\u00a06, and should give\ndebtors pause.[Footnote 7] Cf.In\u00a0re Glenn, 288 B.\u00a0R. 516, 520 (Bkrtcy. Ct. ED\nTenn. 2002) (noting that courts should consider, among other\nfactors, \u201cwhether this is the first or [a] subsequent filin[g]\u201d\nwhen assessing a debtor\u2019s compliance with the good-faith\nrequirement).4Petitioner argues that respondent\nmight have been able to obtain relief by filing under Chapter 7 or\nby converting her Chapter 13 petition to one under Chapter 7. The\navailability of Chapter 7 to debtors like respondent who have\nabove-median incomes is limited. In respondent\u2019s case, a\npresumption of abuse would attach under \u00a7707(b)(2)(A)(i) because\nher disposable income, \u201cmultiplied by 60,\u201d exceeds the amounts\nspecified in subclauses (I) and (II). See also \u00a7707(b)(1) (allowing\na court to dismiss a petition filed by a debtor \u201cwhose debts are\nprimarily consumer debts . . . if it finds that the granting of\nrelief would be an abuse of the provisions of this chapter\u201d); App.\n86\u201388 (\u201cNotice to Individual Consumer Debtor under \u00a7342(b) of the\nBankruptcy Code\u201d) (\u201cIf your income is greater than the median\nincome for your state of residence and family size, in some cases,\ncreditors have the right to file a motion requesting that the court\ndismiss your case under \u00a7707(b) of the Code\u201d). Nevertheless,\npetitioner argues, respondent might have been able to overcome this\npresumption by claiming that her case involves \u201cspecial\ncircumstances\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7707(b)(2)(B)(i). Section 707\nidentifies as examples of \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d a \u201cserious\nmedical condition or a call or order to active duty in the Armed\nForces,\u201dibid., and petitioner directs us to no authority\nfor the proposition that a prepetition decline in income would\nqualify as a \u201cspecial circumstance.\u201d In any event, the \u201cspecial\ncircumstances\u201d exception is available only to the extent that\n\u201cthere is no reasonable alternative,\u201dibid., a proposition\nwe reject with our interpretation of \u00a71325(b)(1) today.[Footnote 8]In sum, each of the strategies\nthat petitioner identifies for mitigating the anomalous effects of\nthe mechanical approach is flawed. There is no reason to think that\nCongress meant for any of these strategies to operate as a safety\nvalve for the mechanical approach.IVWe find petitioner\u2019s remaining\narguments unpersuasive. Consistent with the text of \u00a71325 and\npre-BAPCPA practice, we hold that when a bankruptcy court\ncalculates a debtor\u2019s projected disposable income, the court may\naccount for changes in the debtor\u2019s income or expenses that are\nknown or virtually certain at the time of confirmation. We\ntherefore affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.It is so ordered.Footnote 1However, if a debtor does not file the\nrequired schedule (Schedule I), the bankruptcy court may select a\ndifferent 6-month period. See \u00a7101(10A)(A)(ii).Footnote 2The formula for above-median-income debtors\nis known as the \u201cmeans test\u201d and is reflected in a schedule (Form\n22C) that a Chapter 13 debtor must file. See Fed. Rule Bkrtcy.\nProc. Official Form 22C (2009);In\u00a0re Liverman, 383\nB.\u00a0R. 604, 606, n.\u00a01, 608\u2013609 (Bkrtcy. Ct. NJ 2008).Footnote 3See also,e.g., 8 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a71364(a), (c)(2) (requiring the triennial immigration-impact report\nto include information \u201cprojected for the succeeding five-year\nperiod, based on reasonable estimates substantiated by the best\navailable evidence\u201d); 10 U. S.\u00a0C.\u00a0A. \u00a72433a(a)(2)(B)\n(2010 Cum. Supp.) (\u201cprojected cost of completing the [defense\nacquisition] program based on reasonable modification of [current]\nrequirements\u201d); 15 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7719c(c)(2) (2006 ed.)

InIn\u00a0reSolomon, 67 F.\u00a03d 1128 (1995),\nfor example, the Fourth Circuit refused to make such an adjustment\nbecause it deemed disbursements from an individual retirement\naccount during the plan period to be \u201cspeculative\u201d and\n\u201chypothetical.\u201dId., at 1132. There is no reason to assume\nthat the result would have been the same if future disbursements\nhad been more assured. That was certainly true ofIn\u00a0reKillough, 900 F.\u00a02d 61 (1990), in\nwhich the Fifth Circuit declined to require inclusion of overtime\npay in projected disposable income because it \u201cwas not definite\nenough.\u201dId., at 65; see alsoid., at 66\n(\u201c[T]here may be instances where income obtained through working\novertime can and should appropriately be included in a debtor\u2019s\nprojected disposable income\u201d). See alsoEducation Assistance\nCorp.v.Zellner, 827 F.\u00a02d 1222, 1226 (CA8\n1987) (affirming bankruptcy court\u2019s exclusion of future tax returns\nand salary increases from debtor\u2019s projected disposable income\nbecause they were \u201cspeculative\u201d).Footnote 5For the same reason, the phrase \u201c[f]or\npurposes of this subsection\u201d in \u00a71325(b)(2) is not rendered\nsuperfluous by the forward-looking approach.Footnote 6Under 11 U. S. C. \u00a7521(i)(3), a debtor\nseeking additional time to file a schedule of income must submit\nthe request within 45 days after filing the petition, and the court\nmay not grant an extension of more than 45 days.Footnote 7For example, a debtor otherwise eligible for\nChapter 13 protection may become ineligible if \u201cat any time in the\npreceding 180 days\u201d \u201cthe case was dismissed by the court for\nwillful failure of the debtor to abide by orders of the court, or\nto appear before the court in proper prosecution of the case,\u201d or\n\u201cthe debtor requested and obtained the voluntary dismissal of the\ncase following the filing of a request for relief from the\nautomatic stay provided by section 362 of this title.\u201d \u00a7109(g).Footnote 8Petitioner also suggests that some Chapter 13\ndebtors may be able to plead \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d on the expense\nside of the calculation by virtue of BAPCPA\u2019s incorporation of the\nChapter 7 means test into Chapter 13. See \u00a7707(b)(2)(B)(i), (ii).\nThis is no help to debtors like respondent, whose income has\nchanged but whose expenses are constant.",
