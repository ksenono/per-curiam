    "text": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES_________________No. 15\u2013537_________________JUAN BRAVO-FERNANDEZ AND HECTOR\nMARTINEZ-MALDONADO, PETITIONERSv.UNITED STATESon writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the first circuit[November 29, 2016]Justice Thomas, concurring.The question presented in this case is whether,\nunderAshev.Swenson, 397 U.\u00a0S. 436 (1970) ,\nandYeagerv.United States, 557 U.\u00a0S. 110\n(2009) , a vacated conviction can nullify the preclusive effect of\nan acquittal under the issue-preclusion prong of the Double\nJeopardy Clause.As originally understood, the Double Jeopardy\nClause does not have an issue-preclusion prong. \u201cThe English\ncommon-law pleas ofauterfoits acquitandauterfoits\nconvict,on which the Clause was based, barred only repeated\n\u2018prosecution for the same identical actandcrime.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId.,at 128 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (quoting 4 W.\nBlackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 330 (1769);\nemphasis added by dissent); see alsoGradyv.Corbin,495 U.\u00a0S. 508 \u2013535 (1990) (Scalia, J., dissenting). But \u201c[i]nAshethe Court departed from the original meaning of the\nDouble Jeopardy Clause, holding that it precludes suc-cessive\nprosecutions on distinct crimes when facts essential to conviction\nof the second crime have necessarilybeen resolved in the\ndefendant\u2019s favor by a verdict of ac-quittal of the first crime.\u201dYeager,supra, at 128 (Scalia, J., dissenting).InYeager, this Court erroneously and\nillogically extendedAshe. See 557 U.\u00a0S., at 128\u2013131.\u201cAsheheld only thatthe Clause sometimes bars successive\nprosecution of facts found during \u2018a prior proceeding.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId.,at 129 (quotingAshe,supra, at 444).Yeager, however, \u201cbar[red] retrial on hung counts after what\nwas not .\u00a0.\u00a0. a prior proceeding but simply an earlier\nstage of the same proceeding.\u201d 557 U.\u00a0S., at 129 (Scalia, J.,\ndissenting).In an appropriate case, we should reconsider the\nholdings ofAsheandYeager. Because the Court today\nprop-erly declines to extend those cases, and indeed reaches the\ncorrect result under the Clause\u2019s original meaning, I join its\nopinion.",
