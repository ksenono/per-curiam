In the general statute\ngoverning awards of costs, Congress has specified six categories of\nlitigation expenses that qualify as \u201ccosts.\u201d See 28\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a71821, 1920. The question presented in this\ncase is whether the Copyright Act\u2019s reference to \u201cfull costs\u201d\nauthorizes a court to award litigation expenses beyond the six\ncategories of \u201ccosts\u201d specified by Congress in the general costs\nstatute. The statutory text and our precedents establish that the\nanswer is no. The term \u201cfull\u201d is a term of quantity or amount; it\ndoes not expand the categories or kinds of expenses that may be\nawarded as \u201ccosts\u201d under the general costs statute. In copyright\ncases, \u00a7505\u2019s authorization for the award of \u201cfull costs\u201d therefore\ncovers only the six categories specified in the general costs\nstatute, codified at \u00a7\u00a71821 and 1920. We reverse in relevant part\nthe judgment of the U.\u00a0S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth\nCircuit, and we remand the case for further proceedings consistent\nwith this opinion.IOracle develops and licenses software programs\nthat manage data and operations for businesses and non-profit\norganizations. Oracle also offers its customers software\nmaintenance services.Rimini Street sells third-party software\nmaintenance services to Oracle customers. In doing so, Rimini\ncompetes with Oracle\u2019s software maintenance services.Oracle sued Rimini and its CEO in Federal\nDistrict Court in Nevada, asserting claims under the Copyright Act\nand various other federal and state laws. Oracle alleged that\nRimini, in the course of providing software support services to\nOracle customers, copied Oracle\u2019s software without licensing\nit.A jury found that Rimini had infringed various\nOracle copyrights and that both Rimini and its CEO had violated\nCalifornia and Nevada computer access statutes. The jury awarded\nOracle $35.6 million in damages for copyright infringement and\n$14.4 million in damages for violations of the state computer\naccess statutes. After judgment, the District Court ordered the\ndefendants to pay Oracle an additional $28.5 million in attorney\u2019s\nfees and $4.95 million in costs; the Court of Appeals reduced the\nlatter award to $3.4 million. The District Court also ordered the\ndefendants to pay Oracle $12.8 million for litigation expenses such\nas expert witnesses, e-discovery, and jury consulting.That $12.8 million award is the subject of the\ndispute in this case. As relevant here, the U.\u00a0S. Court of\nAppeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the District Court\u2019s $12.8\nmillion award. The Court of Appeals recognized that the general\nfederal statute authorizing district courts to award costs, 28\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a71821 and 1920, lists only six categories of\ncosts that may be awarded against the losing party. And the Court\nof Appeals acknowledged that the $12.8 million award covered\nexpenses not included within those six categories. But the Court of\nAppeals, relying on Circuit precedent, held that the District\nCourt\u2019s $12.8 million award for additional expenses was still\nappropriate because \u00a7505 permits the award of \u201cfull costs,\u201d a term\nthat the Ninth Circuit said was not confined to the six categories\nidentified in \u00a7\u00a71821 and 1920. 879 F.3d 948, 965\u2212966 (2018).We granted certiorari to resolve disagreement in\nthe Courts of Appeals over whether the term \u201cfull costs\u201d in \u00a7505\nauthorizes awards of expenses other than those costs identified in\n\u00a7\u00a71821 and 1920. 585 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2018).

The Copyright\nAct is one of those statutes. That Act provides that a district\ncourt in a copyright case \u201cin its discretion may allow the recovery\nof full costs by or against any party other than the United States\nor an officer thereof.\u201d 17 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7505.In the general \u201ccosts\u201d statute, codified at\n\u00a7\u00a71821 and 1920 of Title 28, Congress has specified six categories\nof litigation expenses that a federal court may award as\n\u201ccosts,\u201d[1] and Congress has\ndetailed how to calculate the amount of certain costs. Sections\n1821 and 1920 in essence define what the term \u201ccosts\u201d encompasses\nin the subject-specific federal statutes that provide for an award\nof costs.Sections 1821 and 1920 create a default rule and\nestablish a clear baseline against which Congress may legislate.\nConsistent with that default rule, some federal statutes simply\nrefer to \u201ccosts.\u201d In those cases, federal courts are limited to\nawarding the costs specified in \u00a7\u00a71821 and 1920. If, for particular\nkinds of cases, Congress wants to authorize awards of expenses\nbeyond the six categories specified in the general costs statute,\nCongress may do so. For example, some federal statutes go beyond\n\u00a7\u00a71821 and 1920 to expressly provide for the award of expert\nwitness fees or attorney\u2019s fees. SeeWest Virginia Univ.\nHospitals,Inc.v.Casey,499 U.S.\n83, 89, n.\u00a04 (1991). Indeed, the Copyright Act expressly\nprovides for awards of attorney\u2019s fees as well as costs. 17\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7505. And the same Congress that enacted\namendments to the Copyright Act in 1976 enacted several other\nstatutes that expressly authorized awards of expert witness fees.\nSeeCasey, 499 U.\u00a0S., at 88. But absent such express\nauthority, courts may not award litigation expenses that are not\nspecified in \u00a7\u00a71821 and 1920.Our precedents have consistently adhered to that\napproach. Three cases illustrate the point.InCrawford Fitting Co.v.J. T.\nGibbons,Inc., the question was whether courts could\naward expert witness fees under Rule 54(d) of the Federal Rules of\nCivil Procedure. Rule 54(d) authorizes an award of \u201ccosts\u201d but does\nnot expressly refer to expert witness fees.482\nU.S. 437, 441 (1987). In defining what expenses qualify as\n\u201ccosts,\u201d \u00a7\u00a71821 and 1920 likewise do not include expert witness\nfees. We therefore held that the prevailing party could not obtain\nexpert witness fees: When \u201ca prevailing party seeks reimbursement\nfor fees paid to its own expert witnesses, a federal court is bound\nby the limit of \u00a71821(b), absent contract or explicit statutory\nauthority to the contrary.\u201dId., at 439.InCasey, we interpreted 42\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71988, the federal statute authorizing an award\nof \u201ccosts\u201d in civil rights litigation. We describedCrawford\nFittingas holding that \u00a7\u00a71821 and 1920 \u201cdefine the full extent\nof a federal court\u2019s power to shift litigation costs absent express\nstatutory authority to go further.\u201d 499 U.\u00a0S., at 86. In\naccord withCrawford Fitting, we concluded that \u00a71988 does\nnot authorize awards of expert witness fees because \u00a71988 supplies\nno \u201c\u00a0\u2018explicit statutory authority\u2019\u00a0\u201d to award expert\nwitness fees. 499 U.\u00a0S., at 87 (quotingCrawford\nFitting, 482 U.\u00a0S., at 439).InArlington Central School Dist. Bd. of\nEd.v.Murphy, we considered the Individuals with\nDisabilities Education Act, which authorized an award of costs. The\nquestion was whether that Act\u2019s reference to \u201ccosts\u201d encompassed\nexpert witness fees. We again explained that \u201ccosts\u201d is \u201c\u00a0\u2018a\nterm of art that generally does not include expert fees.\u2019\u00a0\u201d548 U.S.\n291, 297 (2006); see alsoTaniguchiv.Kan Pa- cific\nSaipan,Ltd.,566 U.S.\n560, 573 (2012). We stated: \u201c[N]o statute will be construed as\nauthorizing the taxation of witness fees as costs unless the\nstatute \u2018refer[s] explic- itly to witness fees.\u2019\u00a0\u201dMurphy, 548 U.\u00a0S., at 301 (quotingCrawford\nFitting, 482 U.\u00a0S., at 445).Our cases, in sum, establish a clear rule: A\nstatute awarding \u201ccosts\u201d will not be construed as authorizing an\naward of litigation expenses beyond the six categories listed in\n\u00a7\u00a71821 and 1920, absent an explicit statutory instruction to that\neffect. SeeMurphy, 548 U.\u00a0S., at 301 (requiring\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018explici[t]\u2019\u00a0\u201d authority);Casey, 499\nU.\u00a0S., at 86 (requiring \u201c\u00a0\u2018explicit\u2019\u00a0\u201d authority);Crawford Fitting, 482 U.\u00a0S., at 439 (requiring\n\u201cexplicit statutory authority\u201d).Here, the Copyright Act does not explicitly\nauthorize the award of litigation expenses beyond the six\ncategories specified in \u00a7\u00a71821 and 1920. And \u00a7\u00a71821 and 1920 in\nturn do not authorize an award for expenses such as expert witness\nfees, e-discovery expenses, and jury consultant fees, which were\nexpenses encompassed by the District Court\u2019s $12.8 million award to\nOracle here. Rimini argues that the $12.8 million award therefore\ncannot stand.BTo sustain its $12.8 million award, Oracle\nadvances three substantial arguments. But we ultimately do not find\nthose arguments persuasive.First, although Oracle concedes that it\nwould lose this case if the Copyright Act referred only to \u201ccosts,\u201d\nOracle stresses that the Copyright Act uses the word \u201cfull\u201d before\n\u201ccosts.\u201d Oracle argues that the word \u201cfull\u201d authorizes courts to\naward expenses beyond the costs specified in \u00a7\u00a71821 and 1920. We\ndisagree. \u201cFull\u201d is a term of quantity or amount. It is an\nadjective that means the complete measure of the noun it modifies.\nSee American Heritage Dictionary 709 (5th ed. 2011); Oxford English\nDictionary 247 (2d ed. 1989). As we said earlier this Term:\n\u201cAdjectives modify nouns\u2014they pick out a subset of a category that\npossesses a certain quality.\u201dWeyerhaeuser Co.v.United\nStates Fish and Wildlife Serv., 586 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2018)\n(slip op., at 8).The adjective \u201cfull\u201d in \u00a7505 therefore does not\nalter the meaning of the word \u201ccosts.\u201d Rather, \u201cfull costs\u201d are all\nthe \u201ccosts\u201d otherwise available under law. The word \u201cfull\u201d operates\nin the phrase \u201cfull costs\u201d just as it operates in other common\nphrases: A \u201cfull moon\u201d means the moon, not Mars. A \u201cfull breakfast\u201d\nmeans breakfast, not lunch. A \u201cfull season ticket plan\u201d means\ntickets, not hot dogs. So too, the term \u201cfull costs\u201d meanscosts, not other expenses.The dispute here, therefore, turns on the\nmeaning of the word \u201ccosts.\u201d And as we have explained, the term\n\u201ccosts\u201d refers to the costs generally available under the federal\ncosts statute\u2014\u00a7\u00a71821 and 1920. \u201cFull costs\u201d are all the costs\ngenerally available under that statute.Second, Oracle maintains that the term\n\u201cfull costs\u201d in the Copyright Act is a historical term of art that\nencompasses more than the \u201ccosts\u201d listed in the relevant costs\nstatute\u2014here, \u00a7\u00a71821 and 1920. We again disagree.Some general background: From 1789 to 1853,\nfederal courts awarded costs and fees according to the relevant\nstate law of the forum State. SeeCrawford Fitting, 482\nU.\u00a0S., at 439\u2212440;Alyeska Pipeline Service Co.v.Wilderness Society,421 U.S.\n240, 247\u2212250 (1975). In 1853, Congress departed from that\nstate-focused approach. That year, Congress passed and President\nFillmore signed a comprehensive federal statute establishing a\nfederal schedule for the award of costs in federal court.Crawford Fitting, 482 U.\u00a0S., at 440; 10Stat. 161. Known\nas the Fee Act of 1853, that 1853 statute has \u201ccarried forward to\ntoday\u201d in \u00a7\u00a71821 and 1920 \u201c\u00a0\u2018without any apparent intent to\nchange the controlling rules.\u2019\u00a0\u201dCrawford Fitting, 482\nU.\u00a0S., at 440. As we have said, \u00a7\u00a71821 and 1920 provide a\ncomprehensive schedule of costs for proceedings in federal\ncourt.Now some copyright law background: The term\n\u201cfull [c]osts\u201d appeared in the first copyright statute in England,\nthe Statute of Anne. 8 Anne c.19, \u00a78 (1710). In the United States,\nthe Federal Copyright Act of 1831 borrowed the phrasing of English\ncopyright law and used the same term, \u201cfull costs.\u201d Act of Feb. 3,\n1831, \u00a712, 4Stat. 438\u2013439. That term has appeared in subsequent\nrevisions of the Copyright Act, through the Act\u2019s most recent\nsubstantive alterations in 1976. See Act of July 8, 1870, \u00a7108,\n16Stat. 215; Copyright Act of 1909, \u00a740, 35Stat. 1084; Copyright\nAct of 1976, \u00a7505, 90Stat. 2586.Oracle argues that English copyright statutes\nawarding \u201cfull costs\u201d allowed the transfer of all expenses of\nlitigation, beyond what was specified in any costs schedule.\nAccording to Oracle, Congress necessarily imported that meaning of\nthe term \u201cfull costs\u201d into the Copyright Act in 1831. And according\nto Oracle, that 1831 meaning overrides anything that Congress\nenacted in any costs statute in 1853 or later.To begin with, our decision inCrawford\nFittingexplained that courts should not undertake extensive\nhistorical excavation to determine the meaning of costs statutes.\nWe said that \u00a7\u00a71821 and 1920 apply regardless of when individual\nsubject-specific costs statutes were enacted. 482 U.\u00a0S., at\n445. TheCrawford Fittingprinciple eliminates the need for\nthat kind of historical analysis and confirms that the Copyright\nAct\u2019s reference to \u201cfull costs\u201d must be interpreted by reference to\n\u00a7\u00a71821 and 1920.In any event, Oracle\u2019s historical argument fails\neven on its own terms. Oracle has not persuasively demonstrated\nthat as of 1831, the phrase \u201cfull costs\u201d had an established meaning\nin English or American law that covered more than the full amount\nof the costs listed in the applicable costs schedule. On the\ncontrary, the federal courts as of 1831 awarded costs in accord\nwith the costs schedule of the relevant state law. Seeid.,\nat 439\u2212440;Alyeska Pipeline, 421 U.\u00a0S., at 250. And\nstate laws at the time tended to use the term \u201cfull costs\u201d to refer\nto, among other things, full cost awards as distinguished from the\nhalf, double, or treble cost awards that were also commonly\navailable under state law at the time.[2] That usage accorded with the ordinary meaning of the\nterm. At the time, the word \u201cfull\u201d conveyed the same meaning that\nit does today: \u201cComplete; entire; not defective or partial.\u201d 1 N.\nWebster, An American Dictionary of the English Language 89 (1828);\nsee also 1 S. Johnson, A Dictionary of the English Language 817\n(1773) (\u201cComplete, such as that nothing further is desired or\nwanted; Complete without abatement; at the utmost degree\u201d). Full\ncosts did not encompass expenses beyond those costs that otherwise\ncould be awarded under the applicable state law.The case law since 1831 also refutes Oracle\u2019s\nhistorical argument. If Oracle\u2019s account of the history were\ncorrect, federal courts starting in 1831 presumably would have\ninterpreted the term \u201cfull costs\u201d in the Copyright Act to allow\nawards of litigation expenses that were not ordinarily available as\ncosts under the applicable costs schedule. But Rimini points out\nthat none of the more than 800 available copyright decisions\nawarding costs from 1831 to 1976\u2014that is, from the year the term\n\u201cfull costs\u201d first appeared in the Copyright Act until the year\nthat the Act was last significantly amended\u2014awarded expenses other\nthan those specified by the applicable state or federal law. Tr. of\nOral Arg. 7. Oracle has not refuted Rimini\u2019s argument on that\npoint. Oracle cites no \u00a7505 cases where federal courts awarded\nexpert witness fees or other litigation expenses of the kind at\nissue here until the Ninth Circuit\u2019s 2005 decision adopting the\ninterpretation of \u00a7505 that the Ninth Circuit followed in this\ncase. SeeTwentieth Century Fox,429\nF.3d 869.In light of the commonly understood meaning of\nthe term \u201cfull costs\u201d as of 1831 and the case law since 1831,\nOracle\u2019s historical argument falls short. The best interpretation\nis that the term \u201cfull costs\u201d meant in 1831 what it means now: the\nfull amount of the costs specified by the applicable costs\nschedule.Third, Oracle advances a variety of\nsurplusage arguments. Oracle contends, for example, that the word\n\u201cfull\u201d would be unnecessary surplusage if Rimini\u2019s argument were\ncorrect. We disagree. The award of costs in copyright cases wasmandatoryfrom 1831 to 1976. See \u00a740, 35Stat. 1084; \u00a712,\n4Stat. 438\u2013439. During that period, the term \u201cfull\u201d fixed both a\nfloor and a ceiling for the amount of \u201ccosts\u201d that could be\nawarded. In other words, the term \u201cfull costs\u201d required an award of\n100 percent of the costs available under the applicable costs\nschedule.Oracle says that even if that interpretation of\n\u201cfull costs\u201d made sense before 1976, the meaning of the term \u201cfull\ncosts\u201d changed in 1976. That year, Congress amended the Copyright\nAct to make the award of costs discretionary rather than mandatory.\nSee \u00a7505, 90Stat. 2586. According to Oracle, after Congress made\nthe costs award discretionary, district courts could award any\namount of costs up to 100 percent and so Rimini\u2019s reading of the\nword \u201cfull\u201d now adds nothing to \u201ccosts.\u201d If we assume that Congress\nin 1976 did not intend \u201cfull\u201d to be surplusage, Oracle argues that\nCongress must have employed the term \u201cfull\u201d to mean expenses beyond\nthe costs specified in \u00a7\u00a71821 and 1920.For several reasons, that argument does not\npersuade us.To begin with, even if the term \u201cfull\u201d lacked\nany continuing significance after 1976, the meaning of \u201ccosts\u201d did\nnot change. The term \u201ccosts\u201d still means those costs specified in\n\u00a7\u00a71821 and 1920. It makes little sense to think that Congress in\n1976, when it made the award of full costs discretionary rather\nthan mandatory, silently expanded the kinds of expenses that a\ncourt may otherwise award as costs in copyright suits.[3]Moreover, Oracle\u2019s interpretation would create\nits own redundancy problem by rendering the second sentence of \u00a7505\nlargely redundant. That second sentence provides: \u201cExcept as\notherwise provided by this title, the court may also award a\nreasonable attorney\u2019s fee to the prevailing party as part of the\ncosts.\u201d 17 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7505. If Oracle were right that \u201cfull\ncosts\u201d covers all of a party\u2019s litigation expenditures, then the\nfirst sentence of \u00a7505 would presumably already cover attorney\u2019s\nfees and the second sentence would be largely unnecessary. In order\nto avoid some redundancy, Oracle\u2019s interpretation would create\nother redundancy.Finally, even if Oracle is correct that the term\n\u201cfull\u201d has become unnecessary or redundant as a result of the 1976\namendment, Oracle overstates the significance of statutory\nsurplusage or redundancy. Redundancy is not a silver bullet. We\nhave recognized that some \u201credundancy is \u2018hardly unusual\u2019 in\nstatutes addressing costs.\u201dMarxv.General Revenue\nCorp.,568 U.S.\n371, 385 (2013). If one possible interpretation of a statute\nwould cause some redundancy and another interpretation would avoid\nredundancy, that difference in the two interpretations can supply a\nclue as to the better interpretation of a statute. But only a clue.\nSometimes the better overall reading of the statute contains some\nredundancy.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*The Copyright Act authorizes federal district\ncourts to award \u201cfull costs\u201d to a party in copyright litigation.\nThat term means the costs specified in the general costs statute,\n\u00a7\u00a71821 and 1920. We reverse in relevant part the judgment of the\nCourt of Appeals, and we remand the case for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.Notes1The six categories that a\nfederal court may award as costs are: \u201c(1) Fees of the clerk and\nmarshal; \u201c(2) Fees for printed or electronically recorded\ntranscripts necessarily obtained for use in the case; \u201c(3) Fees and\ndisbursements for printing and witnesses; \u201c(4) Fees for\nexemplification and the costs of making copies of any materials\nwhere the copies are necessarily obtained for use in the case; \u201c(5)\nDocket fees under section 1923 of this title; \u201c(6) Compensation of\ncourt appointed experts, compensation of interpreters, and\nsalaries, fees, expenses, and costs of special interpretation\nservices under section 1828 of this title.\u201d 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a71920. In addition, \u00a71821 provides particular reimbursement rates\nfor witnesses\u2019 \u201c[p]er diem and mileage\u201d expenses.2See,e.g., 1 Laws\nof Pa., ch.

In light of\nour disposition of the case, we need not and do not consider that\nargument.",
