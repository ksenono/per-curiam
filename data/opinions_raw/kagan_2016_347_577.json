Suppose a real estate agent promised to find a client \u201ca\nhouse, condo, or apartment in New York.\u201d Wouldn\u2019t the potential\nbuyer be annoyed if the agent sent him information about condos in\nMaryland or California? And consider a law imposing a penalty for\nthe \u201cviolation of any statute, rule, or regulation relating to\ninsider trading.\u201d Surely a person would have cause to protest if\npunished under that provision for violating a traffic statute. The\nreason in all three cases is the same: Everyone understands that\nthe modifying phrase\u2014\u201cinvolved with the new Star Wars movie,\u201d \u201cin\nNew York,\u201d \u201crelating to insider trading\u201d\u2014applies to each term in\nthe preceding list, not just the last.That ordinary understanding of how English\nworks, in speech and writing alike, should decide this case.\nAvondale Lockhart is subject to a 10-year mandatory minimum\nsentence for possessing child pornography if, but only if, he has a\nprior state-law conviction for \u201caggravated sexual abuse, sexual\nabuse, or abusive sexual conduct involving a minor or ward.\u201d 18\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72252(b)(2). The Court today, relying on what is\ncalled the \u201crule of the last antecedent,\u201d reads the phrase\n\u201cinvolving a minor or ward\u201d as modifying only the final term in\nthat three-item list. But properly read, the modifier applies to\neach of the terms\u2014just as in the examples above. That normal\nconstruction finds support in uncommonly clear-cut legislative\nhistory, which states in so many words that the three predicate\ncrimes all involve abuse of children. And if any doubt remained,\nthe rule of lenity would command the same result: Lockhart\u2019s prior\nconviction for sexual abuseof an adultdoes not trigger\n\u00a72252(b)(2)\u2019s mandatory minimum penalty. I respectfully\ndissent.IBegin where the majority does\u2014with the rule of\nthe last antecedent. Seeante,at 3. This Court most fully\ndiscussed that principle inBarnhartv.Thomas, 540\nU.\u00a0S. 20 (2003) , which considered a statute providing that an\nindividual qualifies as disabled if \u201che is not only unable to do\nhis previous work but cannot, considering his age, education, and\nwork experience, engage in any other kind of substantial gainful\nworkwhich exists in the national economy.\u201dId.,at\n21\u201322 (quoting 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7423(d)(2)(A)) (emphasis\nadded). The Court held, invoking the last-antecedent rule, that the\nitalicized phrase modifies only the term \u201csubstantial gainful\nwork,\u201d and not the term \u201cprevious work\u201d occurring earlier in the\nsentence. Two points are of especial note. First,Barnhartcontained a significant caveat: The last-antecedent rule \u201ccan\nassuredly be overcome by other indicia of meaning.\u201d 540 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 26; see,e.g., Nobelmanv.American Savings Bank,\n508 U.\u00a0S. 324 \u2013331 (1993) (refusing to apply the rule when a\ncontrary interpretation was \u201cthe more reasonable one\u201d). Second, the\ngrammatical structure of the provision inBarnhartis\nnothing like that of the statute in this case: The modifying phrase\ndoes not, as here, immediately follow a list of multiple, parallel\nterms. That is true as well in the other instances in which this\nCourt has followed the rule. See,e.g., Jamav.Immigration and Customs Enforcement, 543 U.\u00a0S. 335\n(2005) ;Batchelorv.United States, 156 U.\u00a0S.\n426 (1895) ;Sims Lesseev.Irvine, 3 Dall. 425\n(1799).Indeed, this Court has made clear that the\nlast-antecedent rule does not generally apply to the grammatical\nconstruction present here: when \u201c[t]he modifying clause appear[s]\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. at the end of a single, integrated list.\u201dJama,543 U.\u00a0S., at 344, n.\u00a04. Then, the exact\nopposite is usually true: As in the examples beginning this\nopinion, the modifying phrase refers alike to each of the list\u2019s\nterms. A leading treatise puts the point as follows: \u201cWhen there is\na straightforward, parallel construction that involves all nouns or\nverbs in a series,\u201d a modifier at the end of the list \u201cnormally\napplies to the entire series.\u201d A. Scalia & B. Garner, Reading\nLaw: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 147 (2012); compareid.,at 152 (\u201cWhen the syntax involves something other than\n[such] a parallel series of nouns or verbs,\u201d the modifier \u201cnormally\napplies only to the nearest reasonable referent\u201d). That\ninterpretive practice of applying the modifier to the whole list\nboasts a fancy name\u2014the \u201cseries-qualifier canon,\u201d see Black\u2019s Law\nDictionary 1574 (10th ed. 2014)\u2014but, as my opening examples show,\nit reflects the completely ordinary way that people speak and\nlisten, write and read.[1]Even the exception to the series-qualifier\nprinciple is intuitive, emphasizing both its common-sensical basis\nand its customary usage. When the nouns in a list are so disparate\nthat the modifying clause does not make sense when applied to them\nall, then the last-antecedent rule takes over. Suppose your friend\ntold you not that she wants to meet \u201can actor, director, or\nproducer involved with Star Wars,\u201d but instead that she hopes\nsomeday to meet \u201ca President, Supreme Court Justice, or actor\ninvolved with Star Wars.\u201d Presumably, you would know that she wants\nto meet a President or Justice even if that person has no\nconnection to the famed film franchise. But so long as the\nmodifying clause \u201cis applicable as much to the first and other\nwords as to the last,\u201d this Court has stated, \u201cthe natural\nconstruction of the language demands that the clause be read as\napplicable to all.\u201dParolinev.United States, 572\nU.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 9) (quotingPorto Rico\nRailway, Light & Power Co.v.Mor, 253 U.\u00a0S.\n345, 348 (1920) ). In other words, the modifier then qualifies not\njust the last antecedent but the whole series.As the majority itself must acknowledge, seeante,at 7\u20138, this Court has repeatedly applied the\nseries-qualifier rule in just that manner. InParoline, for\nexample, this Court considered a statute requiring possessors of\nchild pornography to pay restitution to the individuals whose abuse\nis recorded in those materials. The law defines such a victim\u2019s\nlosses to include \u201cmedical services relating to physical,\npsychiatric, or psychological care; physical and occupational\ntherapy or rehabilitation; necessary transportation, temporary\nhousing, and child care expenses; lost income; attorneys\u2019 fees, as\nwell as other costs incurred; and any other losses suffered by the\nvictim as a proximate result of the offense.\u201d 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7\u00a72259(b)(3)(A)\u2013(F) (lettering omitted). The victim bringing the\nlawsuit invoked the last-antecedent rule to argue that the modifier\nat the end of the provision\u2014\u201cas a proximate result of the\noffense\u201d\u2014pertained only to the last item in the preceding list, and\nnot to any of the others. See 572 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at\n9). But the Court rejected that view: It recited the \u201ccanon[\u00a0]\nof statutory construction,\u201d derived from the \u201cnatural\u201d use of\nlanguage, that \u201c[w]hen several words are followed by a clause\u201d that\ncan sensibly modify them all, it should be understood to do so.Ibid.Thus, the Court read the proximate-cause requirement\nto cover each and every term in the list.United Statesv.Bass, 404\nU.\u00a0S. 336 (1971) , to take just one other example, followed\nthe same rule. There, the Court confronted a statute making it a\ncrime for a convicted felon to \u201creceive[\u00a0], possess[\u00a0],\nor transport[\u00a0] in commerce or affecting commerce\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. any firearm.\u201d 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. App. \u00a71202(a)\n(1970 ed.) (current version at 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7922(g)). The\nGovernment contended that the modifying clause\u2014\u201cin commerce or\naffecting commerce\u201d\u2014applied only to\u201ctransport\u201d and not to \u201creceive\u201d\nor \u201cpossess.\u201d But the Court rebuffed that argument. \u201c[T]he natural\nconstruction of the language,\u201d the Court recognized, \u201csuggests that\nthe clause \u2018in commerce or affecting commerce\u2019 qualifies all three\nantecedents in the list.\u201d 404 U.\u00a0S., at 339 (some internal\nquotation marks omitted). Relying on longstanding precedents\nendorsing such a construction, the Court explained: \u201cSince \u2018in\ncommerce or affecting commerce\u2019 undeniably applies to at least one\nantecedent, and since it makes sense with all three, the more\nplausible construction here is that it in fact applies to all\nthree.\u201dId., at 339\u2013340 (citingUnited Statesv.Standard Brewery, Inc., 251 U.\u00a0S. 210, 218 (1920) ;Porto Rico Railway, 253 U.\u00a0S., at 348); see also,e.g.,Jonesv.United States, 529 U.\u00a0S.\n848, 853 (2000) (similarly treating the interstate commerce element\nin the phrase \u201cany building, vehicle, or other real or personal\nproperty used in interstate or foreign commerce\u201d as applying to\nbuildings and vehicles).That analysis holds equally for \u00a72252(b)(2), the\nsentencing provision at issue here. The relevant\nlanguage\u2014\u201caggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse, or abusive sexual\nconduct involving a minor or ward\u201d\u2014contains a \u201csingle, integrated\nlist\u201d of parallel terms (i.e., sex crimes) followed by a\nmodifying clause.Jama, 543 U.\u00a0S., at 344, n.\u00a04.\nGiven the close relation among the terms in the series, the\nmodifier makes sense \u201cas much to the first and other words as to\nthe last.\u201dParoline, 572 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at\n9). In other words, the reference to a minor or ward applies as\nwell to sexual abuse and aggravated sexual abuse as to abusive\nsexual conduct. (The case would be different if, for example, the\nstatute established a mandatory minimum for any person previously\nconvicted of \u201carson, receipt of stolen property, or abusive sexual\nconduct involving a minor or ward.\u201d) So interpreting the modifier\n\u201cas applicable to all\u201d the preceding terms is what \u201cthe natural\nconstruction of the language\u201d requires.Ibid.;Bass,\n404 U.\u00a0S., at 339.The majority responds to all this by claiming\nthat the \u201cinelegant phrasing\u201d of \u00a72252(b)(2) renders it somehow\nexempt from a grammatical rule reflecting \u201chow people ordinarily\u201d\nuse the English language.Ante,at 10. But to begin with,\nthe majority is wrong to suggest that the series-qualifier canon is\nonly about \u201ccolloquial\u201d or \u201cconversational\u201d English.Ibid.\nIn fact, it applies to both speech and writing, in both their\ninformal and their formal varieties. Here is a way to test my\npoint: Pick up a journal, or a book, or for that matter a Supreme\nCourt opinion\u2014most of which keep \u201ceveryday\u201d colloquialisms at a far\ndistance.Ibid. You\u2019ll come across many sentences having the\nstructure of the statutory provision at issue here: a few nouns\nfollowed by a modifying clause. And you\u2019ll discover, again and yet\nagain, that the clause modifies every noun in the series, not just\nthe last\u2014in other words, that even (especially?) in formal writing,\nthe series-qualifier principle works.[2] And the majority is wrong too in suggesting that the\n\u201codd repetition\u201d in \u00a72252(b)(2)\u2019s list of state predicates causes\nthe series-qualifier principle to lose its force.Ibid.The\nmajority\u2019s own made-up sentence proves that much. If a friend asked\nyou \u201cto get her tart lemons, sour lemons, or sour fruit from\nMexico,\u201d you might well think her list of terms perplexing: You\nmight puzzle over the difference between tart and sour lemons, and\nwonder why she had specifically mentioned lemons when she\napparently would be happy with sour fruit of any kind. But of one\nthing, you would have no doubt: Your friend wants some producefrom Mexico; it would not do to get her, say, sour lemons\nfrom Vietnam. However weird the way she listed fruits\u2014or the way\n\u00a72252(b)(2) lists offenses\u2014the modifying clause still refers to\nthem all.The majority as well seeks refuge in the idea\nthat applying the series-qualifier canon to \u00a72252(b)(2) would\nviolate the rule against superfluity. Seeante, at 9\u201310.\nSays the majority: \u201cAny conduct that would qualify as \u2018aggravated\nsexual abuse .\u00a0.\u00a0. involving a minor or ward\u2019 or \u2018sexual\nabuse .\u00a0.\u00a0. involving a minor or ward\u2019 would also qualify\nas \u2018abusive sexual conduct involving a minor or ward.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAnte,at 9. But that rejoinder doesn\u2019t work. \u201c[T]he canon\nagainst superfluity,\u201d this Court has often stated, \u201cassists only\nwhere a competing interpretation gives effect to every clause and\nword of a statute.\u201dMicrosoft Corp.v.i4i Ltd.\nPartnership, 564 U.\u00a0S. 91, 106 (2011) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted); see,e.g.,Bruesewitzv.Wyeth\nLLC, 562 U.\u00a0S. 223, 236 (2011) .\u00a0 And the majority\u2019s\napproach (as it admits, seeante,at 9) produces superfluity\ntoo\u2014and in equal measure. Now (to rearrange the majority\u2019s\nsentence) any conduct that would qualify as \u201cabusive sexual conduct\ninvolving a minor or ward\u201d or \u201caggravated sexual abuse\u201d would also\nqualify as \u201csexual abuse.\u201d In other words, on the majority\u2019s\nreading as well, two listed crimes become subsets of a third, so\nthat the three could have been written as one. And indeed, the\nmajority\u2019s superfluity has an especially odd quality, because it\nrelates to themodifying clause itself: The majority, that is, makes\nthe term \u201cinvolving a minor or ward\u201d wholly unnecessary. Remember\nthe old adage about the pot and the kettle? That is why the rule\nagainst superfluity cannot excuse the majority from reading\n\u00a72252(b)(2)\u2019s modifier, as ordinary usage demands, to pertain to\nall the terms in the preceding series.[3]IILegislative history confirms what the natural\nconstruction of language shows: Each of the three predicate\nof-fenses at issue here must involve a minor. The list of those\ncrimes appears in two places in \u00a72252(b)\u2014both in\u00a72252(b)(1), which\ncontains a sentencing enhancement for those convicted of\ndistributing or receiving child pornography, and in \u00a72252(b)(2),\nwhich includes a similar enhancement for those (like Lockhart)\nconvicted of possessing such material. Descriptions of that list of\noffenses, made at the time Congress added it to those provisions,\nbelie the majority\u2019s position.The relevant language\u2014again, providing for a\nmanda-tory minimum sentence if a person has a prior\nstate-lawconviction for \u201caggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse, or\nabusive sexual conduct involving a minor or ward\u201d\u2014first made its\nappearance in 1996, when Congress inserted it into \u00a72252(b)(1). See\nChild Pornography Prevention Act of 1996, \u00a7121(5), 110Stat.\n3009\u201330, 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72251 note. At that time, the Senate\nReport on the legislation explained what the new language meant:\nThe mandatory minimum would apply to an \u201coffender with a prior\nconviction under .\u00a0.\u00a0. anyState child abuse law.\u201d\nS. Rep. No. 104\u2013358, p. 9 (1996) (emphasis added). It is hard to\nimagine saying any more directly that the just-added state\nsexual-abuse predicates all involve minors, and minors\nonly.[4]Two years later, in urging Congress to include\nthe same predicate offenses in \u00a72252(b)(2), the Department of\nJustice (DOJ) itself read the list that way. In a formal bill\ncomment, DOJ noted that proposed legislation on child pornography\nfailed to fix a statutory oddity: Only \u00a72252(b)(1), and not\n\u00a72252(b)(2), then contained the state predicates at issue here. DOJ\ndescribed that discrepancy as follows: Whereas \u00a72252(b)(1) provided\na penalty enhancement for \u201cindividuals charged with receipt or\ndistribution of child pornographyand who have prior state\nconvictions for child molestation,\u201d the adjacent \u00a72252(b)(2)\ncontained no such enhancement for those \u201ccharged with possession of\nchild pornographywho have prior convictions for child\nabuse.\u201d H. R. Rep. No. 105\u2013557, p. 31 (1998) (emphasis added).\nThat should change, DOJ wrote: A possessor of child pornography\nshould also be subject to a 2-year mandatory minimum if he had \u201caprior conviction for sexual abuse of a minor.\u201dIbid.(emphasis added). DOJ thus made clear that the predicate offenses\nit recom-mended adding to \u00a72252(b)(2)\u2014like those already\nin\u00a72252(b)(1)\u2014related not to all sexual abuse but only to sexual\nabuse of children. And Congress gave DOJ just what it wanted: Soon\nafter receiving the letter, Congress added the language at issue to\n\u00a72252(b)(2), resulting in the requested 2-year minimum sentence.\nSee Protection of Children From Sexual Predators Act of 1998,\n\u00a7202(a)(2), 112Stat. 2977, 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71 note. So every\nindication, in 1998 no less than in 1996, was that all the\npredicate crimes relate to children alone.The majority\u2019s response to this history fails to\nblunt its force. According to the majority, the reference to \u201cany\nstate child abuse law\u201d in the Senate Report is simply an\n\u201cincomplete[\u00a0] descri[ption]\u201d of \u201cthe state sexual-abuse\npredicates.\u201dAnte, at 12. And similarly, the majority\nventures, the DOJ letter was merely noting \u201cone of the provision\u2019s\nmany salient features.\u201dIbid. But suppose that you (like the\nSenate Report\u2019s or DOJ letter\u2019s authors) had to paraphrase or\ncondense the statutory language at issue here, and that you (like\nthe majority) thought it capturedallsexual-abuse crimes.\nWould you then use the phrase \u201cany state child abuse law\u201d as a\ndescriptor (as the Senate Report did)? And would you refer to the\nwhole list of state predicates as involving \u201csexual abuse of a\nminor\u201d (as the DOJ letter did)? Of course not. But you might well\nuse such shorthand if, alternatively, you understood the statutory\nlanguage (as I do) to cover only sexual offenses against children.\nAnd so the authors of the Report and letter did here. Such\ndocuments of necessity abridge statutory language; but they do not\ndo so by conveying an utterly false impression of what that\nlanguage is most centrally about\u2014as by describing a provision that\n(supposedly) covers all sexual abuse as one that reaches only child\nmolestation.[5]Further, the majority objects that the Senate\nReport\u2019s (and DOJ letter\u2019s) drafters did \u201cnothing to explainwhy\u201d Congress would have limited \u00a72252(b)\u2019s state\nsexual-abuse predicates to those involving children when the\nprovision\u2019s federal sexual-abuse predicates (as all agree) are not\nso confined.Ante,at 13 (emphasis in original). But\nCongress is under no obligation to this Court to justify its\nchoices. (Nor is DOJ obliged to explain them to Congress itself.)\nRather, the duty is on this Court to carry out those decisions,\nregardless of whether it understands all that lay behind them. The\nSenate Report (and DOJ letter too) says what it says about\n\u00a72252(b)\u2019s meaning, confirming in no uncertain terms the most\nnatural reading of the statutory language. Explanation or no, that\nis more than sufficient.And the majority (as it concedes) cannot claim\nthat Congress simply must have wanted \u00a72252(b)(2)\u2019s federal and\nstate predicates to be the same. Seeante, at 11 (\u201c[O]ur\nconstruction of \u00a72252(b)(2)\u2019s sexual-abuse predicates does not rely\non a general assumption that Congress sought full parity between\nall of the federal and state predicates\u201d). That is because both\n\u00a72252(b)(1) and \u00a72252(b)(2) contain many federal predicates lacking\nstate matches. Under \u00a72252(b)(1), for example, a person is subject\nto a mandatory minimum if he previously violated 18\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71591, which prohibits \u201c[s]ex trafficking of\nchildren or [sex trafficking] by force, fraud, or coercion.\u201d But if\nthe prior conviction is under state law, only sex trafficking of\nchildren will trigger that minimum; trafficking of adults, even if\nby force, fraud, or coercion, will not. That mismatch\u2014trafficking\nof both adults and children on the federal side, trafficking of\nchildren alone on the state side\u2014precisely parallels my view of the\nsexual-abuse predicates at issue here. More generally, ten federal\nobscenity crimes trigger both \u00a72252(b)(1)\u2019s and \u00a72252(b)(2)\u2019s\nenhanced punishments; but equivalent state crimes do not do so. And\nfive federal prostitution offenses prompt mandatory minimums under\nthose provisions; but no such state offenses do. Noting those\ndisparities, the Government concedes: \u201c[W]hen Congress adds\nstate-law offenses to the lists of predicate offenses triggering\nchild-pornography recidivist enhancements, it sometimes adds state\noffenses corresponding to only a subset of the federal offenses\u201d\npreviously included. Brief for United States 43. Just so. And this\nCourt ought to enforce that choice.IIIAs against the most natural construction of\n\u00a72252(b)(2)\u2019s language, plus unusually limpid legislative history,\nthe majority relies on a structural argument. Seeante,at\n5\u20137. The federal sexual-abuse predicates in \u00a72252(b)(2), the\nmajority begins, are described as crimes \u201cunder .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nChapter 109A,\u201d and that chapter \u201ccriminalizes a range of\nsexual-abuse offenses involving adultsorminors.\u201dAnte,at 5\u20136(emphasis in original). Once again, the majority\ncannot say that this fact alone resolves the question presented,\ngiven the many times (just discussed) that Congress opted to make\nfederal crimes, but not equivalent state crimes, predicates for\n\u00a72252(b)(2)\u2019s mandatory minimums. But the majority claims to see\nmore than that here: The headings of the sections in Chapter 109A,\nit contends, \u201cmirror precisely the order .\u00a0.\u00a0. and nearly\nprecisely the words used to describe\u201d the state predicate crimes at\nissue.Ante,at 6. The majority \u201ccannot state with\ncertainty,\u201d but hazards a guess that Congress thus used Chapter\n109A \u201cas a template for the list of state predicates\u201d\u2014or, otherwise\nsaid, that Congress \u201cfollowed\u201d the \u201cstructure and language of\nChapter 109A\u201d in defining those state-law offenses.Ibid.But \u00a72252(b)(2)\u2019s state predicates are not\nnearly as similar to the federal crimes in Chapter 109A as the\nmajority claims. That Chapter includes the following offenses:\n\u201cAggravated sexual abuse,\u201d \u00a72241, \u201cSexual abuse,\u201d\u00a72242, \u201cSexual\nabuse of a minor or ward,\u201d \u00a72243, and \u201cAbusive sexual contact,\u201d\n\u00a72244. The Chapter thus containsfourcrimes\u2014one more than\nfound in \u00a72252(b)(2)\u2019s list of state offenses. If the drafters of\n\u00a72252(b)(2) meant merely to copy Chapter 109A, why would they have\nleft out one of its crimes? The majority has no\nexplanation.[6] And there is\nmore. Suppose Congress, for whatever hard-to-fathom reason, wanted\nto replicate only Chapter 109A\u2019s first three offenses. It would\nthen have used the same language, referring to \u201cthe laws of any\nState relating to aggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse, or sexual\nabuse of a minor or ward.\u201d (And had Congress used that language,\nthe phrase \u201cof a minor or ward\u201d would clearly have applied only to\nthe third term, to differentiate it from the otherwise identical\nsecond.) But contra the majority, seeante,at 6, 9\u201310, that\nis not what \u00a72252(b)(2)\u2019s drafters did. Rather than repeating the\nphrase \u201csexual abuse,\u201d they used the phrase \u201cabusive sexual\nconduct\u201d in the list\u2019s last term\u2014which echoes, if anything, the\nseparate crime of \u201cabusive sexual contact\u201d (included in Chapter\n109A\u2019sfourthoffense, as well as in other places in the\nfederal code, see,e.g.,10 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7920(d)). The\nchoice of those different words indicates, yet again, that Congress\ndid not mean, as the majority imagines, to duplicate Chapter 109A\u2019s\nset of offenses.Indeed, even the Government has refused to\naccept the notion that the federal and state sexual-abuse\npredicates mirror each other. The Government, to be sure, has\nargued that it would be \u201canomalous\u201d if federal, but notstate,\nconvictions for sexually abusing adults trigger\u00a72252(b)(2)\u2019s\nenhanced penalty. Brief for United States 23. (I have discussed\nthat more modest point above: Anomalous or not, such differences\nbetween federal and state predicates are a recurring feature of the\nstatute. Seesupra,at 12\u201313.) But the Government, in both\nbriefing and argument, rejected the idea that Congress wanted the\nlist of state predicates in \u00a72252(b)(2) to mimic the crimes in\nChapter 109A; in other words, it denied that Congress meant for the\nstate and federal offenses to bear the same meaning. See Brief for\nUnited States 22, n.\u00a08; Tr. of Oral Arg. 26. Even in the face\nof sustained questioning from Members of this Court, the Government\nheld fast to that position. See,e.g.,Tr. of Oral Arg.\n25\u201326 (Justice Alito: \u201c[W]hy do you resist the argument that what\nCongress was doing was picking up basically the definitions of the\nFederal offenses [in Chapter 109A] that are worded almost\nidentically?\u201d Assistant to the Solicitor General: \u201c[W]e don\u2019t think\nthat Congress was trying\u201d to do that). The listed state and federal\noffenses, the Government made clear, are not intended to be\ncopies.The majority seems to think that view somehow\nconsistent with its own hypothesis that Chapter 109A served as a\n\u201ctemplate\u201d for \u00a72252(b)(2)\u2019s state predicates,ante,at 6;\nin responding to one of Lockhart\u2019s arguments, the majority remarks\nthat the state predicates might have a \u201cgeneric\u201d meaning, distinct\nfrom Chapter 109A\u2019s,ante,at 14. But if that is so, the\nmajority\u2019s supposed template is not much of a template after all.\nThe predicate state offenses would \u201cfollow\u201d or \u201cparallel\u201d Chapter\n109A in a single respect, but not in any others\u2014that is, in\nincluding sexual abuse of adults, but not in otherwise defining\nwrongful sexual conduct (whether concerning adults or children).Ante,at 6. The template, one might say, is good for this\ncase and this case only. And the majority has no theory for why\nthat should be so: It offers not the slimmest explanation of how\nChapter 109A can resolve today\u2019s question but not the many issues\ncourts will face in the future involving the meaning of\n\u00a72252(b)(2)\u2019s state predicate offenses. That is because no\nrationale would make sense. The right and consistent view is that\nChapter 109A, like the other federal predicates in \u00a72252(b)(2), is\nacross-the-board irrelevant in defining that provision\u2019s state\npredicates. Thus, the federal chapter\u2019s four differently worded\ncrimes are independent of the three state offenses at issue\nhere\u2014all of which, for the reasons I\u2019ve given, must \u201cinvolv[e] a\nminor or ward.\u201dIVSuppose, for a moment, that this case is not\nas clear as I\u2019ve suggested. Assume there is no way to know whether\nto apply the last-antecedent or the series-qualifier rule. Imagine,\ntoo, that the legislative history is not quite so compelling and\nthe majority\u2019s \u201ctemplate\u201d argument not quite so strained. Who,\nthen, should prevail?This Court has a rule for how to resolve genuine\nambiguity in criminal statutes: in favor of the criminal defendant.\nAs the majority puts the point, the rule of lenity insists that\ncourts side with the defendant \u201cwhen the ordinary canons of\nstatutory construction have revealed no satisfactory construction.\u201dAnte, at 14 (citingCallananv.United States,\n364 U.\u00a0S. 587, 596 (1961) ); see alsoBifulcov.United States, 447 U.\u00a0S. 381, 387 (1980) (holding that\nthe rule of lenity \u201capplies not only to interpretations of the\nsubstantive ambit of criminal prohibitions, but also to the\npenalties they impose\u201d). At the very least, that principle should\ntip the scales in Lockhart\u2019s favor, because nothing the majority\nhas said shows that the modifying clause in \u00a72252(b)(2)unambiguouslyapplies to only the last term in the preceding\nseries.But in fact, Lockhart\u2019s case is stronger.\nConsider the following sentence, summarizing various points made\nabove: \u201cThe series-qualifier principle, the legislative history,\nand the rule of lenity discussed in this opinion all pointin the\nsame direction.\u201d Now answer the following question: Has only the\nrule of lenity been discussed in this opinion, or have the\nseries-qualifier principle and the legislative history been\ndiscussed as well? Even had you not read the preceding 16-plus\npages, you would know the right answer\u2014because of the ordinary way\nall of us use language. That, in the end, is why Lockhart should\nwin.Notes1The majority\u2019s baseball\nexample, seeante, at 4, reads the other way only because\nits three terms arenotparallel. The words \u201ccatcher\u201d and\n\u201cshortstop,\u201d but not \u201cpitcher,\u201d are qualified separate and apart\nfrom the modifying clause at the end of the sentence: \u201cPitcher\u201d\nthus calls for a modifier of its own, and the phrase \u201cfrom the\nKansas City Royals\u201d answers that call. Imagine the sentence is\nslightly reworded to refer to a \u201cdefensive catcher, quick-footed\nshortstop, or hard-throwing pitcher from the Kansas City Royals.\u201d\nOr, alternatively, suppose the sentence referred simply to a\n\u201ccatcher, shortstop, or pitcher from the Kansas City Royals.\u201d\nEither way, all three players must come from the Royals\u2014because the\nthree terms (unlike in the majority\u2019s sentence) are a parallel\nseries with a modifying clause at the end.2Too busy to carry out\nthis homework assignment? Consider some examples (there are many\nmore) from just the last few months of this Court\u2019s work. InOBB\nPersonenverkehr AGv.Sachs, 577 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___\n(2015) (slip op., at 5\u20136), this Court described a lawsuit as\nalleging \u201cwrongful arrest, imprisonment, and tortureby Saudi\npolice.\u201d InJamesv.Boise, 577 U.\u00a0S. ___,\n___ (2016) (per curiam) (slip op., at 2) (quotingMartinv.Hunter\u2019s Lessee, 1 Wheat. 304, 348 (1816)),\nthis Court affirmed that state courts must follow its\ninterpretations of \u201cthe laws, the treaties, and the constitutionof the United States.\u201d InMusacchiov.United\nStates, 577 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 8)\n(quotingReed Elsevier, Inc.v.Muchnick, 559\nU.\u00a0S. 154, 166 (2010) ), this Court noted that in interpreting\nstatutes it looks to the \u201ctext, context, and relevant historical\ntreatmentof the provision at issue.\u201d InFERCv.Electric Power Supply Assn., 577 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2016)\n(slip op., at 15), this Court applied a statute addressing \u201cany\nrule, regulation, practice, or contractaffecting [a wholesale]\nrate [or] charge.\u201d And inMontanilev.Board of\nTrustees of Nat. Elevator Industry Health Benefit Plan, 577\nU.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 2), this Court interpreted\nan employee benefits plan requiring reimbursement \u201cfor attorneys\u2019\nfees, costs, expenses or damagesclaimed by the covered\nperson.\u201d In each case, of course, the italicized modifying\nclause refers to every item in the preceding list. That is because\nthe series-qualifier rule reflects how all of us use language, in\nwriting and in speech, in formal and informal contexts, all the\ntime.3The majority asserts that\nit has found, concealed within \u00a72252(b)(2)\u2019s structure, an\n\u201cexplanation\u201d for its own superfluity,ante,at 9, but that\nclaim, as I\u2019ll soon show, collapses on further examination. Seeinfra, at 13\u201316.4And it makes no\ndifference that the Senate Report accompanied \u00a72252(b)(1)\u2019s, rather\nthan \u00a72252(b)(2)\u2019s, amendment. No one can possibly think (and the\nmajority therefore does not try to argue) that the disputed\nlanguage means something different in \u00a72252(b)(2) than in its\nneighbor and model, \u00a72252(b)(1).5The majority tries to\nbolster its \u201cincomplete description\u201d claim by highlighting another\nsummary statement in the Senate Report, but that reference merely\nillustrates my point. In amending \u00a72252(b)(1) (and later\n\u00a72252(b)(2)), Congress added not only the child sexual-abuse\npredicates at issue here, but also a set of predicate state\noffenses relating to child pornography. Specifically, Congress\nprovided a mandatory minimum sentence for individuals previously\nconvicted of the \u201cproduction, possession, receipt, mailing, sale,\ndistribution, shipment, or transportation of child pornography.\u201d\nChild Pornography Prevention Act, \u00a7121(5), 110Stat. 3009\u201330. The\nSenate Report described those predicate crimes in an abbreviated\nfashion as \u201crelating to the production, receipt or distribution of\nchild pornography.\u201d S. Rep. No. 104\u2013358, p. 9 (1996). That synopsis\ndoubtless leaves some things out, as any synopsis does; but no\nreader of the Report would be terribly surprised to see the fuller\nstatutory list. The same cannot be said of the phrase \u201cany state\nchild abuse law\u201d if that in fact refers to laws prohibitingallrape, sexual assault, and similar behavior.6In a footnote, the\nmajority intimates that Chapter 109A contains only three crimes\u2014but\nthat reading is unambiguously wrong. Unlike the fifth through\neighth sections of that chapter (which the majority invokes to no\npurpose), the fourth\u2014again, entitled \u201c[a]busive sexual\ncontact\u201d\u2014sets out an independent substantive offense, criminalizing\nacts not made illegal in the first three sections. \u00a7\u00a72244(a)\u2013(c);\nsee also 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a716911 (separately listing this\noffense in identifying who must register as a sex offender). The\nmajority, as noted above, gives no reason why Congress would have\nignored that fourth crime had it been using Chapter 109A as a\ntemplate.",
