We hold that an employee is \u201cnewly awarded\ncompensation\u201d when he first becomes disabled and thereby becomes\nstatutorily entitled to benefits, no matter whether, or when, a\ncompensation order issues on his behalf.IAThe LHWCA \u201cis a comprehensive scheme to\nprovide compensation \u2018in respect of disability or death of an\nemployee .\u00a0.\u00a0. if the disability or death results from an\nin- jury occurring upon the navigable waters of the United\nStates.\u2019\u00a0\u201dMetropolitan Stevedore Co.v.Rambo,515 U.S.\n291, 294 (1995) (quoting \u00a7903(a)). An employee\u2019s compensation\ndepends on the severity of his disability and his preinjury pay. A\ntotally disabled employee, for example, is entitled to two-thirds\nof his preinjury average weekly wage as long as he remains\ndisabled. \u00a7\u00a7908(a)\u2013(b), 910.Section 906, however, sets a cap on\ncompensation.[1] Disability\nbenefits \u201cshall not exceed\u201d twice \u201cthe applicable national average\nweekly wage.\u201d \u00a7906(b)(1). The national average weekly wage\u2014\u201cthe\nnational average weekly earnings of production or nonsupervisory\nworkers on private nonagricultural payrolls,\u201d \u00a7902(19)\u2014is\nrecalculated by the Secretary of Labor each fiscal year.\n\u00a7906(b)(3). For most types of disability, the \u201capplicable\u201d national\naverage weekly wage is the figure for the fiscal year in which a\nbeneficiary is \u201cnewly awarded compensation,\u201d and the cap remains\nconstant as long as benefits continue. \u00a7906(c).[2]Consistent with the central bargain of workers\u2019\ncompensation regimes\u2014limited liability for employers; certain,\nprompt recovery for employees\u2014the LHWCA requires that employers pay\nbenefits voluntarily, without formal administrative proceedings.\nOnce an employee provides notice of a disabling injury, his\nemployer must pay compensation \u201cperiodically, promptly, and\ndirectly .\u00a0.\u00a0. without an award, except where liability\nto pay compensation is controverted.\u201d \u00a7914(a). In general,\nemployers pay benefits without contesting liability. SeePallas\nShipping Agency, Ltd.v.Duris,461\nU.S. 529, 532 (1983). In the mine run of cases, therefore, no\ncompensation orders issue.If an employer controverts, or if an employee\ncontests his employer\u2019s actions with respect to his benefits, the\ndispute advances to the Department of Labor\u2019s Office of Workers\u2019\nCompensation Programs (OWCP). See 20 CFR \u00a7\u00a7702.251\u2013702.262 (2011).\nThe OWCP district directors \u201care empowered to amicably and promptly\nresolve such problems by informal procedures.\u201d \u00a7702.301. A district\ndirector\u2019s informal disposition may result in a compen- sation\norder. \u00a7702.315(a). In practice, however, \u201cmany pending claims are\namicably settled through voluntary payments without the necessity\nof a formal order.\u201dIntercounty Constr. Corp.v.Walter,422 U.S.\n1, 4, n.\u00a04 (1975). If informal resolution fails, the\ndistrict director refers the dispute to an administrative law judge\n(ALJ).

Roberts\ninjured his neck and shoulder and did not return to work. On\nreceiving notice of his disability, Sea-Land (except for a six-week\nperiod in 2003) voluntarily paid Roberts benefits absent a\ncompensation order until fiscal year 2005. When Sea-Land\ndiscontinued voluntary payments, Roberts filed an LHWCA claim, and\nSea-Land controverted. In fiscal year 2007, after a hearing, an ALJ\nawarded Roberts benefits at the statutory maximum rate of $966.08\nper week. This was twice the national average weekly wage for\nfiscal year 2002, the fiscal year when Roberts became disabled.Roberts moved for reconsideration, arguing that\nthe \u201cap- plicable\u201d national average weekly wage was the figure for\nfiscal year 2007, the fiscal year when he was \u201cnewly awarded\ncompensation\u201d by the ALJ\u2019s order. The latter figure would have\nentitled Roberts to $1,114.44 per week. The ALJ denied\nreconsideration, and the Department of Labor\u2019s Benefits Review\nBoard (or BRB) affirmed, concluding that \u201cthe pertinent maximum\nrate is determined by the date the disability commences.\u201d App. to\nPet. for Cert. 20. The Ninth Circuit affirmed in relevant part,\nholding that an employee \u201cis \u2018newly awarded compensation\u2019 within\nthe meaning of [\u00a7906(c)] when he first becomes entitled to\ncompensation.\u201dRobertsv.Director, OWCP, 625 F.3d\n1204, 1208 (2010)(per\u00a0curiam). We granted certiorari,\n564 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2011), to resolve a conflict among the Circuits\nwith respect to the time when a beneficiary is \u201cnewly awarded\ncompensation,\u201d and now affirm.[4]IIRoberts contends that \u201cawarded compensation\u201d\nmeans \u201cawarded compensation in a formal order.\u201d Sea-Land, supported\nby the Director, OWCP, responds that \u201cawarded compensation\u201d means\n\u201cstatutorily entitled to compensation because of disability.\u201d The\ntext of \u00a7906(c), standing alone, admits of either interpretation.\nBut \u201cour task is to fit, if possible, all parts into an harmonious\nwhole.\u201dFTCv.Mandel Brothers, Inc.,359 U.S.\n385, 389 (1959). Only the interpretation advanced by Sea-Land\nand the Director makes \u00a7906 a working part of the statutory scheme;\nsupplies an administrable rule that results in equal treatment of\nsimilarly situated beneficiaries; and avoids gamesmanship in the\nclaims process. In light of these contextual and structural\nconsiderations, we hold that an employee is \u201cnewly awarded\ncompensation\u201d when he first becomes disabled and thereby becomes\nstatutorily entitled to benefits under the Act, no matter whether,\nor when, a compensation order issues on his behalf.AWe first consider \u201cwhether the language at\nissue has a plain and unambiguous meaning with regard to the par-\nticular dispute in the case.\u201dRobinsonv.Shell Oil\nCo.,519 U.S.\n337, 340 (1997). The LHWCA does not define \u201cawarded,\u201d but in\nconstruing the Act, as with any statute, \u201c\u00a0\u2018we look first to\nits language, giving the words used their ordinary meaning.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIngalls Shipbuilding, Inc.v.Director, Office of\nWorkers\u2019 Compensation Programs,519 U.S.\n248, 255 (1997) (quotingMoskalv.United States,498 U.S.\n103, 108 (1990)). At first blush, Roberts\u2019 position is\nappealing. In ordinary usage, \u201caward\u201d most often means \u201cgive by\njudicial decree\u201d or \u201cassign after careful judgment.\u201d Webster\u2019s\nThird New International Dictionary 152 (2002); see also,e.g.,Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 157 (9th ed. 2009) (\u201cgrant by\nformal process or by judicial decree\u201d).But \u201caward\u201d can also mean \u201cgrant,\u201d or \u201cconfer or\nbestow upon.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary, at 152;\nsee alsoibid.(1971 ed.) (same). The LHWCA \u201cgrants\u201d\nbenefits to disabled employees, and so can be said to \u201caward\u201d\ncompensation by force of its entitlement-creating provisions.\nIndeed, this Court has often said that statutes \u201caward\u201d\nentitlements. See,e.g.,Astruev.Ratliff,\n560 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 4) (referring to\n\u201cstatutes that award attorney\u2019s fees to a prevailing party\u201d);Barberv.Thomas, 560 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2010)\n(appendix to majority opinion) (slip op., at 19) (statute \u201cawards\u201d\ngood-time credits to federal prisoners);New Energy Co. of\nInd.v.Limbach,486 U.S.\n269, 271 (1988) (Ohio statute \u201cawards a tax credit\u201d);Pacific Employers Ins. Co.v.Industrial Accident\nComm\u2019n,306 U.S.\n493, 500 (1939) (California workers\u2019 compensation statute\n\u201caward[s] compensation for injuries to an employee\u201d); see also,e.g., Connecticutv.Doehr,501 U.S.\n1, 28 (1991) (Rehnquist, C.\u00a0J., concurring in part and\nconcurring in judgment) (\u201cMaterialman\u2019s and mechanic\u2019s lien\nstatutes award an interest in real property to workers\u201d).\nSimilarly, this Court has described an employee\u2019s survivors as\n\u201chaving been \u2018newly awarded\u2019 death benefits\u201d by virtue of the\nemployee\u2019s death, without any reference to a formal order.Director, Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programsv.Rasmussen,440 U.S.\n29, 44, n.\u00a016 (1979) (quoting \u00a7906(c)\u2019s predecessor\nprovision, 33 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7906(d) (1976 ed.)).In short, the text of \u00a7906(c), in isolation, is\nindeterminate.BStatutory language, however, \u201ccannot be\nconstrued in a vacuum. It is a fundamental canon of statutory\nconstruction that the words of a statute must be read in their\ncontext and with a view to their place in the overall statutory\nscheme.\u201dDavisv.Michigan Dept. of Treasury,489 U.S.\n803, 809 (1989). In the context of the LHWCA\u2019s comprehensive,\nreticulated regime for worker benefits\u2014in which \u00a7906 plays a\npivotal role\u2014\u201cawarded compensation\u201d is much more sensibly\ninterpreted to mean \u201cstatutorily entitled to compensation because\nof disability.\u201d[5]1Section 906 governs compensation in all LHWCA\ncases. As explained above, seesupra,at 3, the LHWCA\nrequires employers to pay benefits voluntarily, and in the vast\nmajority of cases, that is just what occurs. Under Roberts\u2019\ninterpretation of \u00a7906(c), no employee receiving voluntary payments\nhas been \u201cawarded compensation,\u201d so none is subject to an\nidentifiable maximum rate of compensation. That result is\nincompatible with the Act\u2019s design. Sec- tion 906(b)(1) caps\n\u201c[c]ompensation for disability or death (other than compensation\nfor death required .\u00a0.\u00a0. to be paid in a lump sum)\u201d at\ntwice \u201cthe applicable national average weekly wage, as determined\nby the Secretary under paragraph (3).\u201d Section 906(b)(3), in turn,\ndirects the Secretary to \u201cdetermine\u201d the national average weekly\nwage before each fiscal year begins on October 1 and provides that\n\u201c[s]uch determination shall be the applicable national average\nweekly wage\u201d for the coming fiscal year. And \u00a7906(c), in its turn,\nprovides that \u201c[d]eterminations under subsection (b)(3)\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. with respect to\u201d a fiscal year \u201cshall apply to\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. those newly awarded compensation during such\u201d\nfiscal year. Through a series of cross-references, the three\nprovisions work together to cap disability benefits.By its terms, and subject to one express\nexception, \u00a7906(b)(1) specifies that the cap applies globally, to\nall disability claims. But all three provisions interlock, so the\ncap functions as Congress intended only if \u00a7906(c) also applies\nglobally, to all such cases. See,e.g.,FDAv.Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp.,529 U.S.\n120, 133 (2000) (\u201cA court must .\u00a0.\u00a0. interpret the\nstatute \u2018as a symmetrical and coherent regulatory scheme\u2019\u00a0\u201d\n(quotingGustafsonv.Alloyd Co.,513 U.S.\n561, 569 (1995))). If Roberts\u2019 interpretation were correct,\n\u00a7906(c) would have no application at all in the many cases in which\nno formal orders issue, because employers make voluntary payments\nor the parties reach informal settlements. We will not construe\n\u00a7906(c) in a manner that renders it \u201centirely superfluous in all\nbut the most unusual circumstances.\u201dTRW Inc.v.Andrews,534 U.S.\n19, 29 (2001).Recognizing this deficiency in his reading of\n\u00a7906(c), Roberts proposes that orders issue in every case, so that\nemployers can lock in the caps in effect at the time their\nemployees become disabled. This is a solution in search of a\nproblem. Under settled LHWCA practice, orders are rare. Roberts\u2019\ninterpretation would set needless administrative machinery in\nmotion and would disrupt the congressionally preferred system of\nvoluntary compensation and informal dispute resolution. The\nincongruity of Roberts\u2019 proposal is highlighted by his inability to\nidentify a vehicle for the entry of an order in an uncontested\ncase. Section 919(c), on which Roberts relies, applies only if an\nemployee has filed a claim. Likewise, 20 CFR \u00a7702.315(a) applies\nonly in the case of a claim or an employer\u2019s no- tice of\ncontroversion. See \u00a7702.301. We doubt that an em- ployee will file\na claim for the sole purpose of assisting his employer in securing\na lower cap. And we will not read \u00a7906(c) to compel an employer to\nfile a baseless notice of controversion. Cf. 33 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7\u00a7928(a), (d) (providing for assessment of attorney\u2019s fees and\ncosts against employers who controvert unsuccessfully). Roberts\nsuggests that employers could threaten to terminate benefits in\norder to induce their employees to file claims, and thus initiate\nthe administrative process. Construing any workers\u2019 compensation\nregime to encourage gratuitous confrontation between employers and\nemployees strikes us as unsound.2Using the national average weekly wage for the\nfiscal year in which an employee becomes disabled coheres with the\nLHWCA\u2019s administrative structure. Section 914(b) requires an\nemployer to pay benefits within 14 days of notice of an employee\u2019s\ndisability. To do so, an employer must be able to calculate the\ncap. An employer must also notify the Department of Labor of\nvoluntary payments by filing a form that indicates,inter\nalia, whether the \u201cmaximum rate is being paid.\u201d Dept. of Labor,\nForm LS\u2013206, Payment of Compensation Without Award (2011), online\nat http://www.dol.gov/owcp/dlhwc/ls-206.pdf. On receipt of this\nform, an OWCP claims examiner must verify the rate of compensation\nin light of the applicable cap. See Dept. of Labor, Longshore\n(DLHWC) Procedure Manual \u00a72\u2013201(3)(b)(3) (hereinafter Longshore\nProcedure Man- ual), online at\nhttp://www.dol.gov/owcp/dlhwc/lspm/lspm2-201.htm. It is difficult\nto see how an employer can apply or certify a national average\nweekly wage other than the one in effect at the time an employee\nbecomes disabled. An employer is powerless to predict when an\nemployee might file a claim, when a compensation order might issue,\nor what the national average weekly wage will be at that later\ntime. Likewise for a claims examiner.[6]Moreover, applying the national average weekly\nwage for the fiscal year in which an employee becomes disabled\nadvances the LHWCA\u2019s purpose to compensate disability, defined as\n\u201cincapacity because of injury to earn the wages which the employee\nwas receivingat the time of injury.\u201d 33 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7902(10) (emphasis added). Just as the LHWCA takes \u201cthe average\nweekly wage of the injured employee at the time of the injury\u201d as\nthe \u201cbasis upon which to compute compensation,\u201d \u00a7910, it is logical\nto apply the national average weekly wage for the same point in\ntime. Administrative practice has long treated the time of injury\nas the relevant date. See,e.g.,Dept. of Labor, Pamphlet\nLS\u2013560, Workers\u2019 Compensation Under the Longshoremen\u2019s Act (rev.\nDec. 2003) (\u201cCompensation payable under the Act may not exceed 200%\nof the national average weekly wage, applicable at the time of\ninjury\u201d), online at http://www.dol.gov/owcp/dlhwc/LS-560pam.htm;\nDept. of Labor, Workers\u2019 Compensation Under the Longshoremen\u2019s Act,\nPamphlet LS\u2013560 (rev. Nov. 1979) (same); see also,e.g.,Dept. of Labor, LHWCA Bulletin No. 11\u201301, p.\u00a02 (2010)\n(national average weekly wage for particular fiscal year applies to\n\u201cdisability incurred during\u201d that fiscal year).[7]Applying the national average weekly wage at the\ntime of onset of disability avoids disparate treatment of simi-\nlarly situated employees. Under Roberts\u2019 reading, two em- ployees\nwho earn the same salary and suffer the same injury on the same day\ncould be entitled to different rates of compensation based on the\nhappenstance of their obtaining orders in different fiscal years.\nWe can imagine no reason why Congress would have intended, by\nchoosing the words \u201cnewly awarded compensation,\u201d to differentiate\nbetween employees based on such an arbitrary criterion.3Finally, using the national average weekly\nwage for the fiscal year in which disability commences discourages\ngamesmanship in the claims process. If the fiscal year in which an\norder issues were to determine the cap, the fact that the national\naverage weekly wage typically rises every year with inflation, see\nn.\u00a02,supra, would become unduly significant. Every\nemployee affected by the cap would seek the entry of a compensation\norder in a later fiscal year. Even an employee who has been\nreceiving compensation at the proper rate for years would be well\nadvised to file a claim for greater benefits in order to obtain an\norder at a later time. Likewise, an employee might delay the\nadjudicatory process to defer the entry of an order. And even in an\nadjudicated case where an employer is found to have paid benefits\nat the proper rate, an ALJ would adopt the later fiscal year\u2019s\nnational average weekly wage, making the increased cap\nretroactively applicable to all of the employer\u2019s payments. Roberts\ncandidly acknowledges that his position gives rise to such perverse\nincentives. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 58\u201359. We decline to adopt a rule\nthat would reward employees with windfalls for initiating\nunnecessary administrative proceedings, while simultaneously\npunishing employers who have complied fully with their statutory\nobligations.IIIWe find Roberts\u2019 counterarguments\nunconvincing.AFirst, Roberts observes that some provisions\nof the LHWCA clearly use \u201caward\u201d to mean \u201caward in a formal order,\u201d\nand contends that the same must be true of \u201cawarded compensation\u201d\nin \u00a7906(c). We agree that the Act sometimes uses \u201caward\u201d as Roberts\nurges. Section 914(a), for example, refers to the payment of\ncompensation \u201cto the person entitled thereto, without an award,\u201d\nforeclosing the equation of \u201centitlement\u201d and \u201caward\u201d that we adopt\nwith respect to \u00a7906(c) today.[8] But the presumption that \u201cidentical words used in\ndifferent parts of the same act are intended to have the same\nmeaning .\u00a0.\u00a0. readily yields whenever there is such\nvariation in the connection in which the words are used as\nreasonably to warrant the conclusion that they were employed in\ndifferent parts of the act with different intent.\u201dGeneral\nDynamics Land Systems, Inc.v.Cline,540 U.S.\n581, 595 (2004) (internal quotation marks and citation\nomitted); see also,e.g., United Statesv.Cleveland\nIndians Baseball Co.,532 U.S.\n200, 213 (2001). Here, we find the presumption overcome because\nseveral provisions of the Act would make no sense if \u201caward\u201d were\nread as Roberts proposes. Those provisions confirm today\u2019s holding\nbecause they too, in context, use \u201caward\u201d to denote a statutory\nentitlement to compensation because of disability.For example, \u00a7908(c)(20) provides that \u201c[p]roper\nand equitable compensation not to exceed $7,500 shall be awarded\nfor serious disfigurement.\u201d Roberts argues that \u00a7908(c)(20)\n\u201cnecessarily contemplates administrative action to fix the amount\nof the liability and direct its payment.\u201d Reply Brief for\nPetitioner 11. In Roberts\u2019 view, no disfigured employee may receive\nbenefits without in- voking the administrative claims process. That\nargu- ment, however, runs counter to \u00a7908\u2019s preface, which directs\nthat \u201c[c]ompensation for disability shall be paid to the employee,\u201d\nand to \u00a7914(a), which requires the payment of compensation \u201cwithout\nan award.\u201d It is also belied by employers\u2019 practice of paying\n\u00a7908(c)(20) benefits voluntarily. See,e.g.,\nWilliams-McDowellv.Newport News Shipbuilding & Dry\nDock Co., No. 99\u20130627 etc., 2000 WL 35928576, *1 (BRB, Mar. 15,\n2000)(per\u00a0curiam);Evansv.Bergeron Barges,\nInc., No. 98\u20131641, 1999 WL 35135283, *1 (BRB, Sept. 3, 1999)(per\u00a0curiam). In light of the LHWCA\u2019s interest in\nprompt payment and settled practice, \u201cawarded\u201d in \u00a7908(c)(20) can\nonly be better read, as in \u00a7906(c), to refer to a disfigured\nemployee\u2019s entitlement to benefits.Likewise, \u00a7908(d)(1) provides that if an\nemployee who is receiving compensation for a scheduled\ndisability[9] dies before\nreceiving the full amount of compensation to which the schedule\nentitles him, \u201cthe total amount of the award unpaid at the time of\ndeath shall be payable to or for the benefit of his survivors.\u201d See\nalso \u00a7908(d)(2). Roberts\u2019 interpretation of \u201caward\u201d would introduce\nan odd gap: Only survivors of those employees who were receiving\nschedule benefits pursuant to orders\u2014not survivors of employees who\nwere receiving voluntary payments\u2014would be entitled to the unpaid\nbalances due their decedents. There is no reason why Congress would\nhave chosen to distinguish between survivors in this manner. And\nthe Benefits Review Board has quite sensibly interpreted \u00a7908(d) to\nmean that \u201can employee has a vested interest in benefits which\naccrue during his lifetime, and, after he dies, his estate is\nentitled to those benefits, regardless of when an award is made.\u201dWoodv.Ingalls Shipbuilding, Inc., 28 BRBS 27, 36\n(1994)(per\u00a0curiam).[10]Finally, \u00a7933(b) provides: \u201cFor the purpose of\nthis subsection, the term \u2018award\u2019 with respect to a compensation\norder means a formal order issued by the deputy commissioner, an\nadministrative law judge, or Board.\u201d Unless award may mean\nsomething other than \u201caward in a compensation order,\u201d this specific\ndefinition would be unnecessary. Roberts contends that this\nprovision, enacted in 1984, \u201cwas indeed \u2018unnecessary\u2019\u00a0\u201d in\nlight ofPallas Shipping. Brief for Petitioner 29; see 461\nU.\u00a0S., at 534 (\u201cThe term \u2018compensation order\u2019 in the LHWCA\nrefers specifi- cally to an administrative award of compensation\nfollowing proceedings with respect to the claim\u201d). Roberts\u2019\nargument offends the canon against superfluity and neglects that\n\u00a7933(b) defines the term \u201caward,\u201d whereasPallas Shippingdefines the term \u201ccompensation order.\u201d Moreover, Congress\u2019\ndefinition of \u201caward,\u201d which tracks Roberts\u2019 preferred\ninterpretation, was carefully limited to \u00a7933(b). Had Congress\nintended to adopt a universal definition of \u201caward,\u201d it could have\ndone so in \u00a7902, the LHWCA\u2019s glossary. Read in light of the \u201cduty\nto give effect, if possible, to every clause and word of a\nstatute,\u201dDuncanv.Walker,533\nU.S. 167, 174 (2001) (internal quotation marks omitted),\n\u00a7933(b) debunks Roberts\u2019 argument that the Act always uses \u201caward\u201d\nto mean \u201caward in a formal order\u201d and confirms that \u201caward\u201d has\nother meanings.BNext, Roberts notes that this Court has\nrefused to read the statutory phrase \u201cperson entitled to\ncompensation\u201d in \u00a7933(g) to mean \u201cperson awarded compensation.\u201d SeeEstate of Cowartv.Nicklos Drilling Co.,505 U.S.\n469, 477 (1992) (\u201c[A] person entitled to compensation need not\nbe receiving compensation or have had an adjudication in his\nfavor\u201d). In Roberts\u2019 view, the converse must also be true: \u201cawarded\ncompensation\u201d in \u00a7906(c) cannot mean \u201centitled to compensation.\u201d\nButCowart\u2019s reasoning does not work in reverse.Cowartdid not construe \u00a7906(c) or the term \u201caward,\u201d but\nrelied on the uniform meaning of the phrase \u201cperson entitled to\ncompensation\u201d in the LHWCA. Seeid.,at 478\u2013479. As just\nexplained, the LHWCA contains no uniform meaning of the term\n\u201caward.\u201d Moreover,Cowartdid not hold that the groups of\n\u201cemployees entitled to compensation\u201d and \u201cemployees awarded\ncompensation\u201d were mutually exclusive. The former group includes\nthe latter: The entry of a compensation order is a sufficient but\nnot necessary condition for membership in the former. Seeid.,at 477.CFinally, Roberts contends that his\ninterpretation furthers the LHWCA\u2019s purpose of providing employees\nwith prompt compensation by encouraging employers to avoid delay\nand expedite administrative proceedings. But Roberts\u2019 remedy would\nalso punish employers who voluntarily pay benefits at the proper\nrate from the time of their employees\u2019 injuries. These employers\nwould owe benefits under the higher cap applicable in any future\nfiscal year when their employees chose to file claims. And Roberts\u2019\nremedy would offer no relief at all to the many beneficiaries\nentitled to less than the statutory maximum rate.The more measured deterrent to employer\ntardiness is interest that \u201caccrues from the date a benefit came\ndue, rather than from the date of the ALJ\u2019s award.\u201dMatulicv.Director, OWCP,154 F.3d 1052, 1059 (CA9 1998). The Director has long taken the\nposition that \u201cinterest is a necessary and inherent component of\n\u2018compensation\u2019 because it ensures that the delay in payment of\ncompensation does not diminish the amount of compensation to which\nthe employee is entitled.\u201dSproullv.Director, OWCP,86 F.3d 895, 900 (CA9 1996); see also,e.g.,Strachan\nShipping Co.v.Wedemeyer, 452 F.2d 1225, 1229 (CA5\n1971). Moreover, \u201c[t]imely controversion does not relieve the\nresponsible party from paying interest on unpaid compensation.\u201d\nLongshore Procedure Manual \u00a78-201, online at\nhttp://www.dol.gov/owcp/dlhwc/lspm/lspm8-201.htm.

Congress enacted \u00a7906\u2019s\npredecessor provision, which included the \u201cnewly awarded\ncompensation\u201d clause, in 1972.

But reading \u201cawarded\ncompensation\u201d as synonymous with \u201creceiving compensation\u201d is\nfarther from the ordinary meaning of \u201caward\u201d than the Court\u2019s\napproach: A person who slipped and fell on a negligently maintained\nsidewalk would not say that she had been \u201cawarded money damages\u201d if\nthe business responsible for the sidewalk voluntarily paid her\nhospital bills. Cf.post,at 3\u20134. Moreover, if Congress had\nintended \u201cawarded compensation\u201d to mean \u201creceiving compensation,\u201d\nit could have said so\u2014as, in fact, it didin \u00a7906(c)\u2019s parallel\nclause, which pertains to beneficiaries \u201ccurrently receiving\ncompensation for permanent total disability or death.\u201d See\nnn.\u00a01\u20132,supra. Justice Ginsburg\u2019s reading denies\neffect to Congress\u2019 textual shift, and therefore \u201cruns afoul of the\nusual rule that \u2018when the legislature uses certain language in one\npart of the statute and different language in another, the court\nassumes different meanings were intended.\u2019\u00a0\u201dSosav.Alvarez-Machain,542 U.S.\n692, 711, n.\u00a09 (2004). Nor is Justice Ginsburg\u2019s reliance\non a single sentence of legislative history persuasive. Seepost,at 4\u20135. True, a Senate committee report described\nthose \u201cnewly awarded compensation\u201d as those \u201cwho begin receiving\ncompensation.\u201d S.\u00a0Rep. No. 92\u20131125, p.\u00a018 (1972). But a\nsubsequent House committee report did not. Cf. H.\u00a0R. Rep. No.\n92\u20131441, p.\u00a015 (1972) (statute provides a \u201cmethod for\ndetermining maximum and minimum compensation (to be applicable to\npersons currently receiving compensation as well as those newly\nawarded compensation)\u201d). The legislative materials are a\npush.6Justice Ginsburg\u2019s\napproach is either easily circumvented or unworkable. For example,\nJustice Ginsburg determines that Roberts is entitled to the fiscal\nyear 2002 maximum rate from March 11, 2002, to July 15, 2003,\nbecause Sea-Land was making voluntary payments during that time.Post,at 6. But Sea-Land was paying Roberts $933.82 per\nweek, less than the $966.08 that the ALJ found Roberts was entitled\nto receive. Compare App. to Pet. for Cert. 101 withid.,at\n107, Order \u00b61. If any voluntary payment suffices, regardless of an\nemployee\u2019s actual entitlement, then an employer can hedge against a\nlater finding of liability by paying the smallest amount to which\nthe Act might entitle an employee but controverting liability as to\nthe remainder. See,e.g.,R. M.v.Sabre Personnel\nAssocs., Inc., 41 BRBS 727, 730 (2007). An employer who\ncontroverts is not subject to the Act\u2019s delinquency penalty. See 33\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7914(e). Perhaps Justice Ginsburg gives Sea-Land\nthe benefit of the doubt because its voluntary payments were close\nto Roberts\u2019 actual entitlement. But if that is so, then how close\nis close enough?7Roberts accurately notes\nthat in some cases, the time of injury and the time of onset of\ndisability differ. We have observed that \u201cthe LHWCA does not\ncompensate physical injury alone but the disability produced by\nthat injury.\u201dMetropolitan Stevedore Co.v.Rambo,515 U.S.\n291, 297 (1995). From that principle, lower courts have rightly\nconcluded that when dates of injury and onset of disability\ndiverge, the latter is the relevant date for determining the\napplicable national average weekly wage. See,e.g.,Service Employees International, Inc.v.Director,\nOWCP, 595 F.3d 447, 456 (CA2 2010);Kubinv.Pro-Football, Inc., 29 BRBS 117 (1995)(per\u00a0curiam). Likewise, in a small group of cases\u2014those\nin which disability lasts more than 3 but less than 15 days\u2014the\ntime of onset of disability and the time of entitlement will\ndiffer. See \u00a7906(a) (\u201cNo compensation shall be allowed for the\nfirst three days of the disability .\u00a0.\u00a0.Provided,\nhow-ever,That in case the injury results in disability of more\nthan fourteen days the compensation shall be allowed from the date\nof the disability\u201d). In these cases, the relevant date is that on\nwhich disability and entitlement coincide: the fourth day after the\nonset of disability.8Other LHWCA provisions,\nread in context, also use award to mean \u201caward in a formal order.\u201d\nFor example, \u00a7\u00a7913(a) and 928(b), like \u00a7914(a), refer to the\npayment of compensation \u201cwithout an award.\u201d And the LHWCA\ndistinguishes between voluntary payments and those due under an\norder for purposes of punishing employer delinquency. Compare\n\u00a7914(e) (10 percent penalty for late payment of \u201ccompensation\npayable without an award\u201d) with \u00a7914(f) (20 percent penalty for\nlate payment of \u201ccompensation, payable under the terms of an\naward\u201d).9Sections 908(c)(1) to\n(20) set forth a \u201cschedule\u201d of particular injuries that entitle an\nemployee \u201cto receive two-thirds of his average weekly wages for a\nspecific number of weeks, regardless of whether his earning\ncapacity has actually been impaired.\u201dPotomac Elec. Power\nCo.v.Director, Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation\nPrograms,449 U.S.\n268, 269 (1980). For example, an employee who loses an arm is\nentitled to two-thirds of his average weekly wage for 312 weeks.\n\u00a7908(c)(1).10Roberts\u2019 interpretation also would\nafford unwarranted significance to the entry of an order in other\ncircumstances, resulting in arbi-trary distinctions within other\nclasses of beneficiaries. For example, \u00a7908(c)(22) provides that if\nan employee suffers from more than one scheduled disability, the\n\u201cawards\u201d for each \u201cshall run consecutively.\u201d Under Roberts\u2019\ninterpretation, \u00a7908(c)(22) would require consecutive payments only\nfor employees who were receiving scheduled disability benefits\npursuant to orders; those receiving voluntary payments presumably\nwould be entitled to concurrent payments. See \u00a7\u00a7914(a)\u2013(b). That\nresult would conflict with \u00a7908(c)(22)\u2019s text, which states that\nconsecutive payments must be made \u201c[i]n any case\u201d involving\nmultiple scheduled disabilities. See,e.g.,Thorntonv.Northrop Grumman Shipbuilding, Inc., 44 BRBS 111 (2010)(per\u00a0curiam). Similarly, \u00a7910(h)(1) sets out two\nformulas for increasing benefitsfor pre-1972 disability or death in\nlight of the higher rates Congress provided in the 1972 LHWCA\namendments. The first applies to those receiving compensation at\nthe then-applicable maximum rate; the second applies to those\n\u201cawarded compensation .\u00a0.\u00a0. at less than the maximum\nrate.\u201d See Dept. of Labor, OWCP Bulletin No. 10\u201373, Adjustment of\nCompensation for Total Permanent Disability or Death Prior to LS/HW\nAmendments of 1972, pp.\u00a02\u20134 (1973). Roberts\u2019 interpretation\nwould make the second formula applicable only to beneficiaries\nreceiving less than the maximum rate pursuant to orders, not to all\nsuch beneficiaries. Again, there is no reason to believe that\nCongress intended this distinction, nor has OWCP applied it. Seeibid.(prescribing a \u201cuniform\u201d method for computing the\nincrease in all \u201c[c]ases being compensated at less than the maximum\nrate,\u201d with no reference to the existence of an\norder).11Thus,\nas under Justice Ginsburg\u2019s approach, an employer who controverts\nstill \u201cruns the risk\u201d of greater liability if an ALJ awards an\nemployee compensation at some point subsequent to the onset of\ndisability. Seepost,at 5.12Because \u201cnewly awarded compensation,\u201d\nread in context, is unambiguous, we do not reach respondents\u2019\nargument that the Director\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7906(c) is entitled\nto deference underChevron U.\u00a0S.\u00a0A.
