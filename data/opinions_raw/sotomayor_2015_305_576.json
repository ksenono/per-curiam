S.\n304 (2002) , this Court recognized that the execution of the\nintellectually disabled contravenes the Eighth Amendment\u2019s\nprohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. AfterAtkinswas decided, petitioner, a Louisiana death-row inmate, requested an\nopportunity to prove he was intellectually disabled in state court.\nWithout affording him an evidentiary hearing or granting him time\nor funding to secure expert evidence, the state court rejected\npetitioner\u2019s claim. That decision, we hold, was \u201cbased on an\nunreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence\npresented in the State court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a72254(d)(2). Petitioner was therefore entitled to have hisAtkinsclaim considered on the merits in federal court.IPetitioner Kevan Brumfield was sentenced to\ndeath for the 1993 murder of off-duty Baton Rouge police officer\nBetty Smothers. Brumfield, accompanied by another individual, shot\nand killed Officer Smothers while she was escorting the manager of\na grocery store to the bank.At the time of Brumfield\u2019s trial, this Court\u2019s\nprecedent permitted the imposition of the death penalty on\nintellectually disabled persons. SeePenryv.Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302, 340 (1989) (opinion of O\u2019Connor,\nJ.). But inAtkins, this Court subsequently held that \u201cin\nlight of .\u00a0.\u00a0. \u2018evolving standards of decency,\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nthe Eighth Amendment \u201c\u00a0\u2018places a substantive restriction on\nthe State\u2019s power to take the life\u2019 of a mentally retarded\noffender.\u201d 536 U. S., at 321 (quotingFordv.Wainwright, 477 U. S. 399, 405 (1986) ).[1] Acknowledging the \u201cdisagreement\u201d regarding how\nto \u201cdetermin[e] which offenders are in fact\u201d intellectually\ndisabled, the Court left \u201cto the State[s] the task of developing\nappropriate ways to enforce the constitutional restriction upon\n[their] execution of sentences.\u201d 536 U. S., at 317 (internal\nquotation marks omitted; some alterations in original).The Louisiana Supreme Court took up the charge\nof implementingAtkins\u2019 mandate inStatev.Williams, 2001\u20131650 (La. 11/1/02), 831 So. 2d 835. The court\nheld that \u201ca diagnosis of mental retardation has three distinct\ncomponents: (1) subaverage intelligence, as measured by objective\nstandardized IQ tests; (2) significant impairment in several areas\nof adaptive skills; and (3) manifestations of this\nneuro-psychological disorder in the developmental stage.\u201dId., at 854 (relying on,inter alia, American\nAssociation of Mental Retardation, Mental Retardation: Definition,\nClassification, and Systems of Supports (10th ed. 2002) (AAMR), and\nAmerican Psychiatric Association, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual\nof Mental Disorders (rev. 4th ed. 2000) (DSM\u2013IV)); see also La.\nCode Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 905.5.1(H)(1) (West Cum. Supp. 2015)\n(subsequently enacted statute governingAtkinsclaims\nadopting the threeWilliamscriteria). TheWilliamscourt also clarified that \u201cnot everyone faced with a death pen-alty\nsentence\u201d would \u201cautomatically be entitled to a post-Atkinshearing\u201d; rather, it would \u201cbe an individual defendant\u2019s burden to\nprovide objective factors that will put at issue the fact of mental\nretardation.\u201d 831 So. 2d, at 857. Borrowing from the state\nstatutory standard for determining when a pretrial competency\ninquiry is necessary, the court held that anAtkinsevidentiary hearing is required when an inmate has put forward\nsufficient evidence to raise a \u201c\u00a0\u2018reasonable ground\u2019\u00a0\u201d to\nbelieve him to be intellectually disabled. Seeid., at 861;\nsee alsoid., at 858, n. 33 (characterizing the requisite\nshowing as one raising a \u201c\u00a0\u2018reasonable\ndoubt\u2019\u00a0\u201d).[2]Shortly after theWilliamsdecision,\nBrumfield amended his pending state postconviction petition to\nraise anAtkinsclaim. He sought an evidentiary hearing on\nthe issue, asserting that his case was \u201caccompanied by a host of\nobjective facts which raise the issue of mental retardation.\u201d App.\n203a.In support, Brumfield pointed to mitigation\nevidence introduced at the sentencing phase of his trial. He\nfocused on the testimony of three witnesses in particular: his\nmother; Dr. Cecile Guin, a social worker who had compiled a history\nof Brumfield by consulting available records and conducting\ninterviews with family members and teachers; and Dr. John Bolter, a\nclinical neuropsychologist who had performed a number of cognitive\ntests on Brumfield. A psychologist, Dr. Brian Jordan, had also\nexamined Brumfield and prepared a report, but did not testify at\ntrial. Brumfield contended that this evidence showed, among other\nthings, that he had registered an IQ score of 75, had a\nfourth-grade reading level, had been prescribed numerous\nmedications and treated at psychiatric hospitals as a child, had\nbeen identified as having some form of learning disability, and had\nbeen placed in special education classes. Seeid., at\n203a\u2013204a. Brumfield further requested \u201call the resources necessary\nto the proper presentation of his case,\u201d asserting that until he\nwas able to \u201cretain the services of various experts,\u201d it would be\n\u201cpremature for [the court] to address [his] claims.\u201dId., at\n207a.Without holding an evidentiary hearing or\ngranting funds to conduct additional investigation, the state trial\ncourt dismissed Brumfield\u2019s petition. With respect to the request\nfor anAtkinshearing, the court stated:\u201cI\u2019ve looked at the application, the response,\nthe record, portions of the transcript on that issue, and the\nevidence presented, including Dr. Bolter\u2019s testimony, Dr. Guinn\u2019s\n[sic] testimony, which refers to and discusses Dr. Jordan\u2019s\nreport, and based on those, since this issue\u2014there was a lot of\ntestimony by all of those in Dr. Jordan\u2019s report.\u201cDr. Bolter in particular found he had an IQ of\nover\u2014or 75. Dr. Jordan actually came up with a little bit higher\nIQ. I do not think that the defendant has demonstrated impairment\nbased on the record in adaptive skills. The doctor testified that\nhe did have an anti-social personality or sociopath, and explained\nit as someone with no conscience, and the defendant hadn\u2019t carried\nhis burden placing the claim of mental retardation at issue.\nTherefore, I find he is not entitled to that hearing based on all\nof those things that I just set out.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert.\n171a\u2013172a.After the Louisiana Supreme Court summarily\ndenied his application for a supervisory writ to review the trial\ncourt\u2019s ruling,Brumfieldv.State, 2004\u20130081 (La.\n10/29/04), 885 So. 2d 580, Brumfield filed a petition for habeas\ncorpus in federal court, again pressing hisAtkinsclaim.\nPursuant to the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of\n1996 (AEDPA), Brumfield could secure relief only if the state\ncourt\u2019s rejection of his claim was either \u201ccontrary to, or involved\nan unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as\ndetermined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\u201d or was\n\u201cbased on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of\nthe evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d 28\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a72254(d)(1), (2).The District Court found that both of these\nrequirements had been met. 854 F. Supp. 2d 366, 383\u2013384 (MD La.\n2012). First, the District Court held that denying Brumfield an\nevidentiary hearing without first granting him funding to develop\nhisAtkinsclaim \u201crepresented an unreasonable application of\nthen-existing due process law,\u201d thus satisfying \u00a72254(d)(1).Id., at 379. Second, and in the alternative, the District\nCourt found that the state court\u2019s decision denying Brumfield a\nhearing \u201csuffered from an unreasonable determination of the facts\nin light of the evidence presented in the state habeas proceeding\nin violation of \u00a72254(d)(2).\u201dIbid.The District Court further determined Brumfield\nto be intellectually disabled based on the extensive evidence it\nreceived during an evidentiary hearing.Id., at 406; seeCullenv.Pinholster, 563 U.\u00a0S. 170 , ___ (2011)\n(slip op., at 13) (recognizing that federal habeas courts may \u201ctake\nnew evidence in an evidentiary hearing\u201d when \u00a72254(d) does not bar\nrelief). This evidence included the results of various IQ\ntests\u2014which, when adjusted to account for measurement errors,\nindicated that Brumfield had an IQ score between 65 and 70, 854 F.\nSupp. 2d, at 392\u2014testimony and expert reports regarding Brumfield\u2019s\nadaptive behavior and \u201csignificantly limited conceptual skills,\u201did., at 401, and proof that these deficits in intellectual\nfunctioning had exhibited themselves before Brumfield reached\nadulthood,id., at 405. Thus, the District Court held,\nBrumfield had \u201cdemonstrated he is mentally retarded as defined by\nLouisiana law\u201d and was \u201cineligible for execution.\u201dId., at\n406.The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth\nCircuit reversed. 744 F. 3d 918, 927 (2014). It held that\nBrumfield\u2019s federal habeas petition failed to satisfy either of\n\u00a72254(d)\u2019s requirements. With respect to the District Court\u2019s\nconclusion that the state court had unreasonably applied clearly\nestablished federal law, the Fifth Circuit rejected the notion that\nany of this Court\u2019s precedents required a state court to grant anAtkinsclaimant the funds necessary to make a threshold\nshowing of intellectual disability. See 744 F. 3d, at 925\u2013926. As\nfor the District Court\u2019s holding that the state court\u2019s decision\nrested on an unreasonable determination of the facts, the Fifth\nCircuit declared that its \u201creview of the record persuad[ed it] that\nthe state court did not abuse its discretion when it denied\nBrumfield an evidentiary hearing.\u201dId., at 926. Having found\nthat Brumfield\u2019s petition failed to clear \u00a72254(d)\u2019s hurdle, the\nFifth Circuit did not review the District Court\u2019s conclusion that\nBrumfield is, in fact, intellectually disabled. Seeid., at\n927, and n. 8.We granted certiorari on both aspects of the\nFifth Circuit\u2019s \u00a72254(d) analysis, 574 U. S. ___ (2014), and now\nvacate its decision and remand for further proceedings.IIBefore this Court, Brumfield advances both of\nthe rationales on which the District Court relied in holding\n\u00a72254(d) to be satisfied. Because we agree that the state court\u2019s\nrejection of Brumfield\u2019s request for anAtkinshearing was\npremised on an \u201cunreasonable determination of the facts\u201d within the\nmeaning of \u00a72254(d)(2), we need not address whether its refusal to\ngrant him expert funding, or at least the opportunity to seekpro bonoexpert assistance to further his threshold showing,\nreflected an \u201cunreasonable application of .\u00a0.\u00a0. clearly\nestablished Federal law,\u201d \u00a72254(d)(1).In conducting the \u00a72254(d)(2) inquiry, we, like\nthe courts below, \u201clook through\u201d the Louisiana Supreme Court\u2019s\nsummary denial of Brumfield\u2019s petition for review and evaluate the\nstate trial court\u2019s reasoned decision refusing to grant Brumfield\nanAtkinsevidentiary hearing. SeeJohnsonv.Williams, 568 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___, n. 1 (2013) (slip op., at\n6, n.\u00a01);Ylstv.Nunnemaker, 501 U. S. 797, 806\n(1991) . Like Brumfield, we do not question the propriety of the\nlegal standard the trial court applied, and presume that a rule\naccording an evidentiary hearing only to those capital defendants\nwho raise a \u201creasonable doubt\u201d as to their intellectual disability\nis consistent with our decision inAtkins. Instead, we train\nour attention on the two underlying factual determinations on which\nthe trial court\u2019s decision was premised\u2014that Brumfield\u2019s IQ score\nwas inconsistent with a diagnosis of intellectual disability and\nthat he had presented no evidence of adaptive impairment. App. to\nPet. for Cert. 171a\u2013172a.[3]We may not characterize these state-court\nfactual determinations as unreasonable \u201cmerely because [we] would\nhave reached a different conclusion in the first instance.\u201dWoodv.Allen, 558 U. S. 290, 301 (2010) . Instead,\n\u00a72254(d)(2) requires that we accord the state trial court\nsubstantial deference. If \u201c\u00a0\u2018[r]easonable minds reviewing the\nrecord might disagree\u2019 about the finding in question, \u2018on habeas\nreview that does not suffice to supersede the trial court\u2019s\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. determination.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIbid.(quotingRicev.Collins, 546 U. S. 333 \u2013342 (2006)). As we\nhave also observed, however, \u201c[e]ven in the context of federal\nhabeas, deference does not imply abandonment or abdication of\njudicial review,\u201d and \u201cdoes not by definition preclude relief.\u201dMiller-Elv.Cockrell, 537 U. S. 322, 340 (2003) .\nHere, our examination of the record before the state court compels\nus to conclude that both of its critical factual determinations\nwere unreasonable.AThe state trial court\u2019s rejection of\nBrumfield\u2019s request for anAtkinshearing rested, first, on\nDr. Bolter\u2019s testi-mony that Brumfield scored 75 on an IQ test and\nmay have scored higher on another test. See App. to Pet. for Cert.\n171a. These scores, the state court apparently believed, belied the\nclaim that Brumfield was intellectually disabled because they\nnecessarily precluded any possibility that he possessed subaverage\nintelligence\u2014the first of the three criteria necessary for a\nfinding of intellectual disability. But in fact, this evidence was\nentirely consistent with intellectual disability.To qualify as \u201csignificantly subaverage in\ngeneral intellectual functioning\u201d in Louisiana, \u201cone must be more\nthan two standard deviations below the mean for the test of\nintellectual functioning.\u201dWilliams, 831 So. 2d, at 853\n(internal quotation marks omitted). On the Wechsler scale for\nIQ\u2014the scale employed by Dr. Bolter\u2014that would equate to a score of\n70 or less. Seeid., at 853\u2013854, n. 26.As the Louisiana Supreme Court cautioned inWilliams, however, an IQ test result cannot be assessed in a\nvac-uum. In accord with sound statistical methods, the court\nexplained: \u201c[T]he assessment of intellectual functioning through\nthe primary reliance on IQ tests must be tempered with attention to\npossible errors in measurement.\u201dIbid.Thus,Williamsheld, \u201c[a]lthough Louisiana\u2019s definition of significantly\nsubaverage intellectual functioning does not specifically use the\nword \u2018approximately,\u2019 because of the SEM [(standard error of\nmeasurement)], any IQ test score has a margin of error and is only\na factor in assessing mental retardation.\u201dId., at 855, n.\n29.Accounting for this margin of error, Brumfield\u2019s\nreported IQ test result of 75 was squarely in the range of\npotential intellectual disability. The sources on whichWilliamsrelied in defining subaverage intelligence both\ndescribe a score of 75 as being consistent with such a diagnosis.\nSee AAMR, at 59; DSM\u2013IV, at 41\u201342; see alsoStatev.Dunn, 2001\u20131635 (La. 5/11/10), 41 So. 3d 454, 470 (\u201cThe\nranges associated with the two scores of 75 brush the threshold\nscore for a mental retardation diagnosis\u201d).[4] Relying on similar authorities, this Court observed\ninAtkinsthat \u201can IQ between 70 and 75 or lower\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. is typically considered the cutoff IQ score for the\nintellectual function prong of the mental retardation definition.\u201d\n536 U. S., at 309, n. 5. Indeed, in adopting these definitions, the\nLouisiana Supreme Court anticipated our holding inHallv.Florida,572 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2014), that it is\nunconstitutional to foreclose \u201call further exploration of\nintellectual disability\u201d simply because a capital defendant is\ndeemed to have an IQ above 70.Id., at ___ (slip op., at 1);\nsee alsoid., at ___ (slip op., at 12) (\u201cFor professionals\nto diagnose\u2014and for the law then to determine\u2014whether an\nintellectual disability exists once the SEM applies and the\nindividual\u2019s IQ score is 75 or below the inquiry would consider\nfactors indicating whether the person had deficits in adaptive\nfunctioning\u201d). To conclude, as the state trial court did, that\nBrumfield\u2019s reported IQ score of 75 somehow demonstrated that he\ncould not possess subaverage intelligence therefore reflected an\nunreasonable determination of the facts.Nor was there evidence of any higher IQ test\nscore that could render the state court\u2019s determination reasonable.\nThe state court claimed that Dr. Jordan, who examined Brumfield but\nnever testified at trial, \u201ccame up with a little bit higher IQ.\u201d\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 171a. At trial, the existence of such a test\nscore was mentioned only during the cross-examination of Dr.\nBolter, who had sim-ply acknowledged the following: \u201cDr. Jordan\nrated his intelligence just a little higher than I did. But Dr.\nJordan also only did a screening test and I gave a standardized\nmeasure of intellectual functioning.\u201d App. 133a. And in fact, Dr.\nJordan\u2019s written report provides no IQ score. Seeid., at\n429a.[5] The state court\ntherefore could not reason-ably infer from this evidence that any\nexamination Dr. Jordan had performed was sufficiently rigorous to\npreclude definitively the possibility that Brumfield possessed\nsubaverage intelligence. SeeStatev.Dunn, 2001\u20131635\n(La. 11/1/02), 831 So. 2d 862, 886, n. 9 (orderingAtkinsevidentiary hearing even though \u201cprison records indicate[d]\u201d the\ndefendant had an \u201c\u00a0\u2018estimated IQ of 76,\u2019\u00a0\u201d emphasizing\ntestimony that prison officials \u201cdid not do the formal IQ\ntesting\u201d).BThe state court\u2019s refusal to grant Brumfield\u2019s\nrequest for anAtkinsevidentiary hearing rested, next, on\nits con-clusion that the record failed to raise any question as to\nBrumfield\u2019s \u201cimpairment .\u00a0.\u00a0. in adaptive skills.\u201d App.\nto Pet. for Cert. 171a. That determination was also\nunreasonable.The adaptive impairment prong of an intellectual\ndis-ability diagnosis requires an evaluation of the individual\u2019s\nability to function across a variety of dimensions. The Louisiana\nSupreme Court inWilliamsdescribed three separate sets of\ncriteria that may be utilized in making this assessment. See 831\nSo. 2d, at 852\u2013854. Although Louisiana courts appear to utilize all\nthree of these tests in evaluating adaptive impairment, seeDunn, 41 So. 3d, at 458\u2013459, 463, for the sake of simplicity\nwe will assume that the third of these tests, derived from\nLouisiana statutory law, governed here, as it appears to be the\nmost favorable to the State.[6]\nUnder that standard, an individual may be intellectually disabled\nif he has \u201csubstantial functional limitations in three or more of\nthe following areas of major life activity: (i) Self-care. (ii)\nUnderstanding and use of language. (iii) Learning. (iv) Mobility.\n(v) Self-direction. (vi) Capacity for independent living.\u201dWilliams, 831 So. 2d, at 854 (quoting then La. Rev. Stat.\nAnn. \u00a728:381(12) (repealed 2005)).The record before the state court contained\nsufficient evidence to raise a question as to whether Brumfield met\nthese criteria. During the sentencing hearing, Brumfield\u2019s mother\ntestified that Brumfield had been born prematurely at a very low\nbirth weight. App. 28a. She also recounted that he had been taken\nout of school in the fifth grade and hospitalized due to his\nbehavior, and recalled an incident in which he suffered a seizure.Id., at 34a\u201338a, 41a, 47a.Social worker Dr. Guin elaborated on this\ntestimony, explaining that Brumfield\u2019s low birth weight indicated\n\u201cthat something ha[d] gone wrong during the pregnancy,\u201d that\nmedical records suggested Brumfield had \u201cslower responses than\nnormal babies,\u201d and that \u201cthey knew that something was wrong at\nthat point.\u201dId., at 75a\u201376a. Dr. Guin also confirmed that,\nbeginning in fifth grade, Brumfield had been placed in special\nclasses in school and in multiple mental health facilities, and had\nbeen prescribed antipsychotics and sedatives.Id., at 89a,\n93a\u201394a.[7] Moreover, one\nreport Dr. Guin reviewed from a facility that treated Brumfield as\na child \u201cquestioned his intellectual functions,\u201d and opined that\n\u201che probably had a learning disability related to some type of\nslowness in motor development, some type of physiological\n[problem].\u201dId., at 89a. Dr. Guin herself reached a similar\nconclusion, stating that Brumfield \u201cobviously did have a\nphysiologically linked learning disability that he was born with,\u201d\nand that his \u201cbasic problem was that he .\u00a0.\u00a0. could not\nprocess information.\u201dId., at 90a, 98a.Finally, Dr. Bolter, who had performed \u201ca\ncomprehensive battery of tests,\u201d confirmed that Brumfield had a\n\u201cborderline general level of intelligence.\u201dId., at\n127a\u2013128a. His low intellect manifested itself in a fourth-grade\nreading level\u2014and he reached that level, Dr. Bolter elaborated,\nonly with respect to \u201csimple word recognition,\u201d and \u201cnot even\ncomprehension.\u201dId., at 128a; see alsoid., at 134a.\nIn a written report submitted to the state court, Dr. Bolter\nfurther noted that Brumfield had deficiencies \u201cfrequently seen in\nindividuals with a history of learning disabilities,\u201d and \u201cclearly\u201d\nhad \u201clearning characteristics that make it more difficult for him\nto acquire new information.\u201dId., at 418a, 420a. Dr. Bolter\nalso testified that Brumfield\u2019s low birth weight had \u201cplace[d] him\n[at] a risk of some form of potential neurological trauma,\u201d and\naffirmed that the medications administered to Brumfield as a child\nwere generally reserved for \u201csevere cases.\u201dId., at 130a,\n132a.All told, then, the evidence in the state-court\nrecord provided substantial grounds to question Brumfield\u2019s\nadaptive functioning. An individual, like Brumfield, who was placed\nin special education classes at an early age, was suspected of\nhaving a learning disability, and can barely read at a fourth-grade\nlevel, certainly would seem to be deficient in both\n\u201c[u]nderstanding and use of language\u201d and \u201c[l]earning\u201d\u2014two of the\nsix \u201careas of major life activity\u201d identified inWilliams.\n831 So. 2d, at 854. And the evidence of his low birth weight, of\nhis commitment to mental health facilities at a young age, and of\nofficials\u2019 administration of antipsychotic and sedative drugs to\nhim at that time, all indicate that Brumfield may well have had\nsignificant deficits in at least one of the remaining four areas.\nSeeibid.In advancing its contrary view of the record,\nthe state court noted that Dr. Bolter had described Brumfield as\nsomeone with \u201can antisocial personality.\u201d App. 127a; see App. to\nPet. for Cert. 171a. The relevance of this diagnosis is, however,\nunclear, as an antisocial personality is not inconsistent with any\nof the above-mentioned areas of adaptive impairment, or with\nintellectual disability more generally. The DSM\u2013IV\u2014one of the\nsources on which theWilliamscourt relied in defining\nintellectual disability\u2014provides: \u201cThe diagnostic criteria for\nMental Retardation do not include an exclusion criterion;\ntherefore, the diagnosis should be made .\u00a0.\u00a0. regardless\nof and in addition to the presence of another disorder.\u201d DSM\u2013IV, at\n47; see also AAMR, at 172 (noting that individuals with\nintellectual disability also tend to have a number of other mental\nhealth disorders, including personality disorders).To be sure, as the dissent emphasizes,post, at 13\u201314, 18, other evidence in the record before the\nstate court may have cut against Brumfield\u2019s claim of intellectual\ndisability. Perhaps most significant, in his written report Dr.\nBolter stated that Brumfield \u201cappears to be normal from a\nneurocognitive perspective,\u201d with a \u201cnormal capacity to learn and\nacquire information when given the opportunity for repetition,\u201d and\n\u201cproblem solving and reasoning skills\u201d that were \u201cadequate.\u201d App.\n421a. Likewise, the underlying facts of Brumfield\u2019s crime might\narguably provide reason to think that Brumfield possessed certain\nadaptive skills, as the murder for which he was convicted required\na degree of advanced planning and involved the acquisition of a car\nand guns. But cf. AAMR, at 8 (intellectually disabled persons may\nhave \u201cstrengths in social or physical capabilities, strengths in\nsome adaptive skill areas, or strengths in one aspect of an\nadaptive skill in which they otherwise show an overall\nlimitation\u201d).It is critical to remember, however, that in\nseeking an evidentiary hearing, Brumfield was not obligated to show\nthat he was intellectually disabled, or even that he would likely\nbe able to prove as much. Rather, Brumfield needed only to raise a\n\u201creasonable doubt\u201d as to his intellectual disability to be entitled\nto an evidentiary hearing. SeeWilliams, 831 So. 2d, at 858,\nn. 33. The Louisiana Supreme Court\u2019s decision inWilliamsillustrated how low the threshold for an evidentiary hearing was\nintended to be: There, the court held that the defendant was\nentitled to a hearing on hisAtkinsclaim notwithstanding\nthe fact that \u201cthe defense\u2019s own expert testified unequivocally, at\nboth the guilt and penalty phases of trial, that [the] defendant is\nnot mentally retarded,\u201d an assessment \u201cbased on the fact that [the]\ndefendant [was] not deficient in adaptive functioning.\u201d 831\nSo.\u00a02d, at 855; see alsoDunn, 831 So. 2d, at 885, 887\n(ordering hearing despite expert testimony that the defendant \u201chad\nnever been identified as a child who was a slow learner,\u201d and had\n\u201creceived college credit for courses completed during his\nincarceration\u201d). Similarly, in light of the evidence of Brumfield\u2019s\ndeficiencies, none of the countervailing evidence could be said to\nforeclose all reasonable doubt. An individual who points to\nevidence that he was at risk of \u201cneurological trauma\u201d at birth, was\ndiagnosed with a learning disability and placed in special\neducation classes, was committed to mental health facilities and\ngiven powerful medication, reads at a fourth-grade level, and\nsimply cannot \u201cprocess information,\u201d has raised substantial reason\nto believe that he suffers from adaptive impairments.That these facts were alone sufficient to raise\na doubt as to Brumfield\u2019s adaptive impairments is all the more\napparent given that Brumfield had not yet had the opportunity to\ndevelop the record for the purpose of proving an intellectual\ndisability claim. At his pre-Atkinstrial, Brumfield had\nlittle reason to investigate or present evidence relating to\nintellectual disability. In fact, had he done so at the penalty\nphase, he ran the risk that it would \u201cenhance the likelihood\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. future dangerousness [would] be found by the jury.\u201dAtkins, 536 U. S., at 321. Thus, given that the evidence\nfrom trial provided good reason to think Brumfield suffered from an\nintellectual disability, there was even greater cause to believe he\nmight prove such a claim in a full evidentiary hearing. Indeed, the\nLouisiana Supreme Court had made clear that a capital defendant in\nBrumfield\u2019s position should be accorded this additional benefit of\nthe doubt when it defined the standard for assessing whether a\nhearing is required. EchoingAtkins\u2019 observation that\npenalty-phase evidence of intellectual disability can be a\n\u201ctwo-edged sword,\u201dibid.,Williamsnoted that where a\ntrial \u201cwas conducted prior toAtkins,\u201d the defense\u2019s \u201ctrial\nstrategy may have been to shift the focus away from any diagnosis\nof mental retardation.\u201d 831 So. 2d, at 856, n. 31. For that reason,\ntheWilliamscourt considered the fact that the defendant\n\u201cha[d] not had the issue of mental retardation put before the fact\nfinder in light of theAtkinsrestriction on the death\npenalty\u201d as a factor supporting the requisite threshold showing\nthat \u201centitled [him] to an evidentiary hearing.\u201dId., at\n857; accord,Dunn, 831 So. 2d, at 886. Here, the state trial\ncourt should have taken into account that the evidence before it\nwas sought and introduced at a time when Brumfield\u2019s intellectual\ndisability was not at issue. The court\u2019s failure to do so resulted\nin an unreasonable determination of the facts.IIIAUrging affirmance of the decision below, the\nState advances two additional arguments that we need discuss only\nbriefly.First, the State suggests that rather than being\nevaluated pursuant to \u00a72254(d)(2)\u2019s \u201cunreasonable determination of\nthe facts\u201d standard, Brumfield\u2019s attack on the state trial court\u2019s\ndecision should instead be \u201c\u00a0\u2018reviewed under the arguably more\ndeferential standard set out in \u00a72254(e)(1).\u2019\u00a0\u201d Brief for\nRespondent 30 (quotingWood, 558 U. S., at 301).[8] We have not yet \u201cdefined the precise\nrelationship between \u00a72254(d)(2) and \u00a72254(e)(1),\u201dBurtv.Titlow, 571 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 5), and\nwe need not do so here. The State did not press below the theory\nthat \u00a72254(e)(1) supplies the governing standard when a court\nevaluates whether a habeas petitioner has satisfied \u00a72254(d)(2)\u2019s\nrequirements, the Fifth Circuit did not address that possibility,\nand the State in its brief in opposition to certiorari failed to\nadvance any specific argument that the decision below could be\nsupported by invocation of that statutory provision. See Brief in\nOpposition 60\u201364. The argument is therefore \u201cproperly \u2018deemed\nwaived.\u2019\u00a0\u201dGranite Rock Co.v.Teamsters, 561\nU.\u00a0S. 287, 306 (2010) (quoting this Court\u2019s Rule 15.2).Second, the State contends that Brumfield\u2019s\nrequest for anAtkinshearing was properly rejected because\nthe record evidence failed to show that Brumfield\u2019s intellectual\ndeficiencies manifested while he was in the \u201cdevelopmental\nstage\u201d\u2014that is, before he reached adulthood.Williams, 831\nSo. 2d, at 854. But the state trial court never made any finding\nthat Brumfield had failed to produce evidence suggesting he could\nmeet this age-of-onset requirement. There is thus no determination\non that point to which a federal court must defer in assessing\nwhether Brumfield satisfied \u00a72254(d). SeePanettiv.Quarterman, 551 U. S. 930 \u2013954 (2007); compare,e.g.,Wigginsv.Smith, 539 U. S. 510, 534 (2003)\n(reviewingde novothe question whether petitioner had\nsuffered prejudice where state court\u2019s reasoned decision rejecting\nclaim underStricklandv.Washington, 466 U. S. 668\n(1984) , was premised solely on conclusion that attorney\u2019s\nperformance had not been constitutionally deficient), withHarringtonv.Richter, 562 U.\u00a0S. 86, 98 (2011)\n(requiring federal habeas court to defer to hypothetical reasons\nstate court might have given for rejecting federal claim where\nthere is no \u201copinion explaining the reasons relief has been\ndenied\u201d). In any event, the state-court record contained ample\nevidence creating a reasonable doubt as to whether Brumfield\u2019s\ndisability manifested before adulthood: Both Dr. Guin and Dr.\nBolter testified at length about Brumfield\u2019s intellectual\nshortcomings as a child and their possible connection to his low\nbirth weight. If Brumfield presented sufficient evidence to suggest\nthat he was intellectually limited, as we have made clear he did,\nthere is little question that he also established good reason to\nthink that he had been so since he was a child.BFinally, we offer a few additional words in\nresponse to Justice Thomas\u2019 dissent. We do not deny that\nBrumfield\u2019s crimes were terrible, causing untold pain for the\nvictims and their families. But we are called upon today to resolve\na different issue. There has already been one death that society\nrightly condemns. The question here is whether Brumfield cleared\nAEDPA\u2019s procedural hurdles, and was thus entitled to a hearing to\nshow that he so lacked the capacity for self-determination that it\nwould violate the Eighth Amendment to permit the State to impose\nthe \u201claw\u2019s most severe sentence,\u201dHall, 572 U.\u00a0S., at\n___ (slip op., at 7), and take his life as well. That question, and\nthat question alone, we answer in the affirmative.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*We hold that Brumfield has satisfied the\nrequirements of \u00a72254(d). The judgment of the United States Court\nof Appeals for the Fifth Circuit is therefore vacated, and the case\nis remanded for further proceedings consistent with this\nopinion.It is so ordered.Notes1While this Court formerly\nemployed the phrase \u201cmentally retarded,\u201d we now \u201cus[e] the term\n\u2018intellectual disability\u2019 to describe the identical phenomenon.\u201dHallv.Florida, 572 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip\nop., at 2).2Although Louisiana\nsubsequently adopted a statute governing the adjudication ofAtkinsclaims, see La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 905.5.1\n(West Cum. Supp. 2015), the parties agree that the procedures set\nforth inWilliamsgoverned this case. See Brief for\nPetitioner 26, n.\u00a07; Brief for Respondent 13, n.\u00a06; see\nalsoStatev.Dunn, 2007\u20130878 (La. 1/25/08), 974\nSo.\u00a02d 658, 662 (holding that this statute does not\n\u201cestablis[\u00a0h] a procedure to be used forAtkinshearings conducted post-trial and/or\npost-sentencing\u201d).3The dissent accuses us of\n\u201crecasting legal determinations as factual ones.\u201dPost, at\n15 (opinion of Thomas, J.) (emphasis deleted) (hereinafter the\ndissent). But we subject these determinations to review under\n\u00a72254(d)(2) instead of \u00a72254(d)(1) because we are concerned here\nnot with the adequacy of the procedures and standards the state\ncourt applied in rejecting Brumfield\u2019sAtkinsclaim, but\nwith the underlying factual conclusions the court reached when it\ndetermined that the record evidence was inconsistent with\nintellectual disability. SeeMaggiov.Fulford, 462\nU. S. 111, 117 (1983) (per curiam) (reviewing under the\npredecessor to \u00a72254(d)(2) the \u201cfactual conclusions\u201d underlying a\nstate court\u2019s conclusion that a criminal defendant had raised no\ndoubt as to his competency to stand trial). We look to Louisiana\ncase law only because it provides the framework in which these\nfactual determinations were made, and makes clear that the state\ncourt\u2019s decision rejecting Brumfield\u2019sAtkinsclaim was\npremised on those determinations. And we apply \u00a72254(d)(2) at the\nbehest of the State itself, which invokes that provision (and\n\u00a72254(e)(1)\u2019s similarly fact-focused standard) in contending that\nAEDPA bars Brumfield\u2019sAtkinsclaim, and characterizes the\ndeterminations we review here as \u201chighly factual.\u201d Brief for\nRespondent 25.4The dissent insists that\nwe have ignored language inWilliamsestablishing that \u201cthe\nrequisite IQ could range \u2018from 66 to 74.\u2019\u00a0\u201dPost, at 18\n(quotingWilliams, 831 So.\u00a02d, at 854, n. 26). But the\ndissent wrenches the quoted language out of context. TheWilliamsCourt actually said: \u201cOne SEM is plus or minus a\nspecified number of IQ points. Thus, an IQ of 70 could range from\n66 to 74 assuming an SEM of 4.\u201d 831 So.\u00a02d, at 854, n. 26.Williamsdid not thereby hold that an SEM of 4, and a\nresultant range of 66 to 74, must be used; it was simply using this\nexample to illustrate the concept of SEM.5There is some question\nwhether Dr. Jordan\u2019s report, which was introduced in federal habeas\nproceedings, was ever entered into the state-court record. See 854\nF.\u00a0Supp. 2d 366, 380, n. 13 (MD La. 2012) (accepting counsel\u2019s\nrepresentation that the report was not in the state-court record);\nbut see Tr. of Oral Arg. 50 (State\u2019s counsel asserting that it\nwas). We see no need to resolve this dispute, though we note that\nthe report is not currently contained in the state-court record\nlodged with the District Court.6The other two standards\nset forth inWilliamswere: the AAMR criteria, which require\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018limitations in two or more of the following applicable\nadaptive skill areas: communication, self-care, home living, social\nskills, community use, self-direction, health and safety,\nfunctional academics, leisure, and work,\u2019\u00a0\u201d 831 So. 2d, at\n852, n. 22; and the DSM\u2013IV criteria, which similarly require\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018significant limitations\u2019\u00a0\u201d in \u201c\u00a0\u2018at least two of\nthe following skill areas: communication, self-care, home living,\nsocial/interpersonal skills, use of community resources,\nself-direction, functional academic skills, work, leisure, health,\nand safety,\u2019\u00a0\u201did., at 853, n. 25.7While the dissent\ncontends that the record shows Brumfield\u2019s placement in special\neducation classes was simply due to his misbehavior,post,\nat 19, Dr. Guin testified that Brumfield\u2019s behavioral problems were\nin part a function of a learning disability, see App.\n86a.8Section 2254(e)(1)\nprovides: \u201cIn a proceeding instituted by an application for a writ\nof habeas corpus by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of\na State court, a determination of a factual issue made by a State\ncourt shall be presumed to be correct. The applicant shall have the\nburden of rebutting the presumption of correctness by clear and\nconvincing evidence.\u201d",
