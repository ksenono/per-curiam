It also\ncorrectly concludes that the District Court properly enjoined\nCalifornia\u2019s attorney general from collecting the forms at issue,\nwhich contain sensitive donor information. But, while I agree with\nmuch of the Court\u2019s opinion, I would approach three issues\ndifferently.First, the bulk of \u201cour precedents\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. require application of strict scrutiny to laws that\ncompel disclosure of protected First Amendment association.\u201dDoev.Reed,561 U.S.\n186, 232 (2010) (Thomas, J., dissenting). California\u2019s law fits\nthat description. Although the Court rightly holds that even the\nless demanding \u201cexacting scrutiny\u201d standard requires narrow\ntailoring for laws that compel disclosure,ante, at 9\u201311,\ninvoking exacting scrutiny is at odds with our repeated recognition\n\u201cthat privacy of association is protected under the First\nAmendment.\u201d 561 U.\u00a0S.,at 240 (Thomas, J., dissenting).\nThe text and history of the Assembly Clause suggest that the right\nto assemble includes the right to associate anonymously. See 4\nAnnals of Cong. 900\u2013902, 941\u2013942 (1795) (defending the\nDemocratic-Republican societies, many of which met in secret, as\nexercising individuals\u2019 \u201cleave to assemble\u201d); see also Brief for\nBecket Fund for Religious Liberty asAmicus Curiae13\u201320;\nReply Brief in No. 19\u2013251, pp. 3\u20135;NAACPv.Alabama ex\nrel. Patterson,357 U.S.\n449(1958) (discussing the history of anonymous publications).\nAnd the right to associate anonymously often operates as a vehicle\nto protect other First Amendment rights, such as the freedom of the\npress.McIntyrev.Ohio Elections Comm\u2019n,514 U.S.\n334, 361\u2013367 (1995) (Thomas, J., concurring) (\u201cFounding-era\nAmericans\u201d understood the freedom of the press to include the right\nof printers and publishers not to be compelled to disclose the\nauthors of anonymous works). Laws directly burdening the right to\nassociate anonymously, including compelled disclosure laws, should\nbe subject to the same scrutiny as laws directly burdening other\nFirst Amendment rights.Doe, 561 U.\u00a0S., at 232,\n240.Second, the Court holds the law \u201coverbroad\u201d and,\nthus, invalid in all circumstances.Ante, at 16. But I\ncontinue to have \u201cdoubts about [the] origins and application\u201d of\nour \u201coverbreadth doctrine.\u201dUnited Statesv.Sineneng-Smith, 590 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2020) (Thomas, J.,\nconcurring) (slip op., at 1). That doctrine purports to grant\nfederal courts the power to invalidate a law \u201cif a substantial\nnumber of its applications are unconstitutional, judged in relation\nto the statute\u2019s plainly legitimate sweep.\u201dIbid.(internal\nquotation marks omitted). However, the Court has no power to enjoin\nthelawfulapplication of a statute just because that\nstatute might be unlawful as-applied in other circumstances.Id.,at ___ (slip op., at 9);Bordenv.United\nStates, 593 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2021) (Thomas, J., concurring)\n(slip op., at 4) (\u201ca court cannot, consistent with separation of\npowers, enjoin enforcement of a statute where enforcement would be\nlawful\u201d). And the principle that application of a law is always\nunlawful if \u201c\u00a0\u2018a substantial number of its applications are\nunconstitutional\u2019\u00a0\u201d \u201clacks any basis in the Constitution\u2019s\ntext\u201d and \u201ccontravenes traditional standing principles.\u201dSineneng-Smith, 590 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (Thomas, J.,\nconcurring) (slip op., at 1).Third, and relatedly, this Court also lacks the\npower \u201cto \u2018pronounce that the statute is unconstitutional inallapplications,\u2019 \u201d even if the Court suspects that the law\nwill likely be unconstitutional in every future application as\nopposed to just a substantial number of its applications.Borden, 593 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (Thomas, J., concurring)\n(slip op., at 3) (quotingChicagov.Morales, 527\nU.\u00a0S 41, 77 (1999) (Scalia, J., dissenting)). A declaration\nthat the law is \u201cfacially\u201d unconstitutional \u201cseems to me no more\nthan an advisory opinion\u2014which a federal court should never issue\nat all.\u201d 593 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (Thomas, J., concurring) (slip op.,\nat 3).Courts cannot \u201cstrike down statutory text\u201d or resolve\nthe legal rights of litigants not before them.Ibid.(brackets and internal quotation marks omitted).Despite the Court\u2019s use of the term \u201cfacially\nunconstitutional,\u201d I join Part III\u2013A, which finds that California\u2019s\nlaw fails exacting scrutiny, because the Court does not say that it\nis \u201cprovid[ing] relief beyond the parties to the case.\u201dTrumpv.Hawaii, 585 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2018)\n(Thomas, J., concurring) (slip op., at 6). The Court simply (and\ncorrectly) holds that the District Court properly enjoined the lawas appliedto petitioners.Ante, at 19. The Court\u2019s\njudgment is also not dependent on its overbreadth determination.Ante, at 12\u201315. One can understand the Court\u2019s reasoning as\nbased on the fundamental legal problems with the law (that are\nobvious in light of the facts of this suit) that will, in practice,\nprevent California from lawfully applying the disclosure\nrequirement against a substantial number of entities, including\npetitioners.With those points of difference clarified, I\njoin Parts I, II\u2013A, II\u2013B\u20132, and III\u2013A of the majority\u2019s opinion and\nconcur in the judgment.",
