Anxious\nto rid our docket of bothersome residual clause cases, the Court is\nwilling to do what it takes to get the job done. So brushing asidestare decisis, the Court holds that the residual clause is\nunconstitutionally vague even though we have twice rejected that\nvery argument within the last eight years. The canons of\ninterpretation get no greater respect. Inverting the canon that a\nstatute should be construed if possible to avoid\nunconstitutionality, the Court rejects a reasonable construction of\nthe residual clause that would avoid any vagueness problems,\npreferring an alternative that the Court finds to be\nunconstitutionally vague. And the Court is not stopped by the\nwell-established rule that a statute is void for vagueness only if\nit is vague in all its applications. While conceding that some\napplications of the residual clause are straightforward, the Court\nholds that the clause is now void in its entirety. The Court\u2019s\ndetermination to be done with residual clause cases, if not its\nfidelity to legal principles, is impressive.IAPetitioner Samuel Johnson (unlike his famous\nnamesake) has led a life of crime and violence. His presentence\ninvestigation report sets out a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of petty and serious crimes,\nbeginning when he was 12 years old. Johnson\u2019s adult record includes\nconvictions for, among other things, robbery, attempted robbery,\nillegal possession of a sawed-off shotgun, and a drug offense.In 2010, the Federal Bureau of Investigation\n(FBI) began monitoring Johnson because of his involvement with the\nNational Socialist Movement, a white-supremacist organization\nsuspected of plotting acts of terrorism. In June of that year,\nJohnson left the group and formed his own radical organization, the\nAryan Liberation Movement, which he planned to finance by\ncounterfeiting United States currency. In the course of the\nGovernment\u2019s investigation, Johnson \u201cdisclosed to undercover FBI\nagents that he manufactured napalm, silencers, and other explosives\nfor\u201d his new organization. 526 Fed. Appx. 708, 709 (CA8 2013)\n(per curiam). He also showed the agents an AK\u201347 rifle, a\nsemiautomatic rifle, a semiautomatic pistol, and a cache of\napproximately 1,100 rounds of ammunition. Later, Johnson told an\nundercover agent: \u201cYou know I\u2019d love to assassinate some\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. hoodrats as much as the next guy, but I think we\nreally got to stick with high priority targets.\u201d Revised\nPresentence Investigation Report (PSR) \u00b615. Among the top targets\nthat he mentioned were \u201cthe Mexican consulate,\u201d \u201cprogressive\nbookstores,\u201d and individuals he viewed as \u201cliberals.\u201d\nPSR\u00a0\u00b616.In April 2012, Johnson was arrested, and he was\nsubsequently indicted on four counts of possession of a firearm by\na felon and two counts of possession of ammunition by a felon, in\nviolation of 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a7922(g) and \u00a7924(e). He pleaded\nguilty to one of the firearms counts, and the District Court\nsentenced him to the statutory minimum of 15 years\u2019 imprisonment\nunder ACCA, based on his prior felony convictions for robbery,\nattempted robbery, and illegal possession of a sawed-off\nshotgun.BACCA provides a mandatory minimum sentence for\ncertain violations of \u00a7922(g), which prohibits the shipment,\ntransportation, or possession of firearms or ammunition by\nconvicted felons, persons previously committed to a mental\ninstitution, and certain others. Federal law normally provides a\nmaximum sentence of 10 years\u2019 imprisonment for such crimes. See\n\u00a7924(a)(2). Under ACCA, however, if a defendant convicted under\n\u00a7922(g) has three prior convictions \u201cfor a violent felony or a\nserious drug offense,\u201d the sentencing court must impose a sentence\nof at least 15 years\u2019 imprisonment. \u00a7924(e)(1).ACCA\u2019s definition of a \u201cviolent felony\u201d has\nthree parts. First, a felony qualifies if it \u201chas as an element the\nuse, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the\nperson of another.\u201d \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i). Second, the Act specifically\nnames four categories of qualifying felonies: burglary, arson,\nextortion, and offenses involving the use of explosives. See\n\u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii). Third, the Act contains what we have called a\n\u201cresidual clause,\u201d which reaches any felony that \u201cotherwise\ninvolves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical\ninjury to another.\u201dIbid.The present case concerns the residual clause.\nThe sole question raised in Johnson\u2019s certiorari petition was\nwhether possession of a sawed-off shotgun under Minne-sota law\nqualifies as a violent felony under that clause. Although Johnson\nargued in the lower courts that the residual clause is\nunconstitutionally vague, he did not renew that argument here.\nNevertheless, after oral argument, the Court raised the question of\nvagueness on its own. The Court now holds that the residual clause\nis unconstitutionally vague in all its applications. I cannot\nagree.III begin withstare decisis. Eight years\nago inJamesv.United States, 550 U.\u00a0S. 192\n(2007) , Justice Scalia, the author of today\u2019s opinion for the\nCourt, fired an opening shot at the residual clause. In dissent, he\nsuggested that the residual clause is void for vagueness.Id., at 230. The Court held otherwise, explaining that the\nstandard in the residual clause \u201cis not so indefinite as to prevent\nan ordinary person from understanding\u201d its scope.Id., at\n210, n.\u00a06.Four years later, inSykesv.United\nStates, 564 U.\u00a0S. 1 (2011) , Justice Scalia fired another\nround. Dissenting once again, he argued that the residual clause is\nvoid for vagueness and rehearsed the same basic arguments that the\nCourt now adopts. Seeid.,at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 7\u20138);\nsee alsoDerbyv.United States, 564 U.\u00a0S. ___,\n___\u2013___ (2011) (Scalia, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari)\n(slip op., at 4\u20135). As inJames, the Court rejected his\narguments. SeeSykes, 564 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at\n13\u201314). In fact, Justice Scalia was theonlyMember of theSykesCourt who took the position that the residual clause\ncould not be intelligibly applied to the offense at issue. The\nopinion of the Court, which five Justices joined, expressly held\nthat the residual clause \u201cstates an intelligible principle and\nprovides guidance that allows a person to \u2018conform his or her\nconduct to the law.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId., at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at\n13\u201314) (quotingChicagov.Morales, 527 U.\u00a0S.\n41, 58 (1999) (plurality opinion)). Justice Thomas\u2019s concurrence,\nwhile disagreeing in part with the Court\u2019s interpretation of the\nresidual clause, did not question its constitutionality. SeeSykes, 564 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (opinion concurring in\njudgment). And Justice Kagan\u2019s dissent, which Justice Ginsburg\njoined, argued that a proper application of the provision required\na different result. Seeid.,at ___. Thus, eight Members of\nthe Court found the statute capable of principled application.It is, of course, true that \u201c[s]tare\ndecisisis not an inexorable command.\u201dPaynev.Tennessee, 501 U.\u00a0S. 808, 828 (1991) . But neither is\nit an empty Latin phrase. There must be good reasons for overruling\na precedent, and there is none here. Nothing has changed since our\ndecisions inJamesandSykes\u2014nothing, that is, except\nthe Court\u2019s weariness with ACCA cases.Reprising an argument that Justice Scalia made\nto no avail inSykes,supra, at ___ (dissenting\nopinion) (slip op., at 7), the Court reasons that the residual\nclause must be unconstitutionally vague because we have had trouble\nsettling on an interpretation. Seeante,at 7. But\ndisagreement about the meaning and application of the clause is not\nnew. We were divided inJamesand inSykesand in our\nintervening decisions inBegayv.United States, 553\nU.\u00a0S. 137 (2008) , andChambersv.United\nStates,555 U.\u00a0S. 122 (2009) . And that pattern is not\nunique to ACCA; we have been unable to come to an agreement on many\nrecurring legal questions. The Confrontation Clause is one example\nthat comes readily to mind. See,e.g., Williamsv.Illinois, 567 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2012);Bullcomingv.New Mexico, 564 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2011);Melendez-Diazv.Massachusetts, 557 U.\u00a0S. 305 (2009) . Our\ndisagreements about the meaning of that provision do not prove that\nthe Confrontation Clause has no ascertainable meaning. Likewise,\nour disagreements on the residual clause do not prove that it is\nunconstitutionally vague.The Court also points to conflicts in the\ndecisions of the lower courts as proof that the statute is\nunconstitutional. Seeante,at 9\u201310. The Court overstates\nthe degree of disagreement below. For many crimes, there is no\ndispute that the residual clause applies. And our certiorari docket\nprovides a skewed picture because the decisions that we are asked\nto review are usually those involving issues on which there is at\nleast an arguable circuit conflict. But in any event, it has never\nbeen thought that conflicting interpretations of a statute justify\njudicial elimination of the statute. One of our chief\nresponsibilities is to resolve those disagreements, see Supreme\nCourt Rule 10, not to strike down the laws that create this\nwork.The Court may not relish the task of resolving\nresidual clause questions on which the Circuits disagree, but the\nprovision has not placed a crushing burden on our docket. In the\neight years sinceJames, we have decided all of three cases\ninvolving the residual clause. SeeBegay,supra;Chambers,supra;Sykes,supra.\nNevertheless, faced with the unappealing prospect of resolving more\ncircuit splits on various residual clause issues, seeante,at 9, six Members of the Court have thrown in the towel. That is\nnot responsible.IIIEven if we putstare decisisaside, the\nCourt\u2019s decision remains indefensible. The residual clause is not\nunconstitutionally vague.AThe Fifth Amendment prohibits the enforcement\nof vague criminal laws, but the threshold for declaring a law void\nfor vagueness is high. \u201cThe strong presumptive validity that\nattaches to an Act of Congress has led this Court to hold many\ntimes that statutes are not automatically invalidated as vague\nsimply because difficulty is found in determining whether certain\nmarginal offenses fall within their language.\u201dUnited Statesv.National Dairy Products Corp., 372 U.\u00a0S. 29, 32\n(1963) . Rather, it is sufficient if a statute sets out an\n\u201cascertainable standard.\u201dUnited Statesv.L. Cohen\nGrocery Co., 255 U.\u00a0S. 81 (1921). A statute is thus void\nfor vagueness only if it wholly \u201cfails to provide a person of\nordinary intelligence fair notice of what is prohibited, or is so\nstandardless that it authorizes or encourages seriously\ndiscriminatory enforcement.\u201dUnited Statesv.Williams, 553 U.\u00a0S. 285, 304 (2008) .The bar is even higher for sentencing\nprovisions. The fair notice concerns that inform our vagueness\ndoctrine are aimed at ensuring that a \u201c\u00a0\u2018person of ordinary\nintelligence [has] a reasonable opportunity to know what is\nprohibited, so that he may act accordingly.\u2019\u00a0\u201dHoffman\nEstatesv.Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., 455\nU.\u00a0S. 489, 498 (1982) (quotingGraynedv.City of\nRockford, 408 U.\u00a0S. 104, 108 (1972) ). The fear is that\nvague laws will \u201c\u00a0\u2018trap the innocent.\u2019\u00a0\u201d 455 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 498. These concerns have less force when it comes to sentencing\nprovisions, which come into play only after the defendant has been\nfound guilty of the crime in question. Due process does not\nrequire, as Johnson oddly suggests, that a \u201cprospective criminal\u201d\nbe able to calculate the precise penalty that a conviction would\nbring. Supp. Brief for Petitioner 5; seeChapmanv.United States, 500 U.\u00a0S. 453 \u2013468 (1991) (concluding\nthat a vagueness challenge was \u201cparticularly\u201d weak \u201csince whatever\ndebate there is would center around the appropriate sentence and\nnot the criminality of the conduct\u201d).BACCA\u2019s residual clause unquestionably provides\nan ascertainable standard. It defines \u201cviolent felony\u201d to include\nany offense that \u201cinvolves conduct that presents a serious\npotential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d 18\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii). That language is by no means\nincomprehensible. Nor is it unusual. There are scores of federal\nand state laws that employ similar standards. The Solicitor\nGeneral\u2019s brief contains a 99-page appendix setting out some of\nthese laws. See App. to Supp. Brief for United States; see alsoJames,supra, at 210, n.\u00a06. If all these laws\nare unconstitutionally vague, today\u2019s decision is not a blast from\na sawed-off shotgun; it is a nuclear explosion.Attempting to avoid such devastation, the Court\ndistinguishes these laws primarily on the ground that almost all of\nthem \u201crequire gauging the riskiness of conduct in which an\nindividual defendant engageson aparticular\noccasion.\u201dAnte, at 12 (emphasis in original). The Court\nthus admits that, \u201c[a]s a general matter, we do not doubt the\nconstitutionality of laws that call for the application of a\nqualitative standard such as \u2018substantial risk\u2019 to real-world\nconduct.\u201dIbid.Its complaint is that the residual clause\n\u201crequires application of the \u2018serious potential risk\u2019 standard to\nanidealized ordinary case of the crime.\u201dIbid.\n(emphasis added). Thus, according to the Court, ACCA\u2019s residual\nclause is unconstitutionally vague because its standard must be\napplied to \u201can idealized ordinary case of the crime\u201d and not, like\nthe vast majority of the laws in the Solicitor General\u2019s appendix,\nto \u201creal-world conduct.\u201dACCA, however, makes no reference to \u201can\nidealized ordinary case of the crime.\u201d That requirement was the\nhandiwork of this Court inTaylorv.United States,495 U.\u00a0S. 575 (1990) . And as I will show, the residual clause\ncan reasonably be interpreted to refer to\n\u201creal-worldconduct.\u201d[1]CWhen a statute\u2019s constitutionality is in\ndoubt, we have an obligation to interpret the law, if possible, to\navoid the constitutional problem. See,e.g., Edward J. DeBartolo\nCorp.v.Florida Gulf Coast Building & Constr. Trades\nCouncil, 485 U.\u00a0S. 568, 575 (1988) . As one treatise puts\nit, \u201c[a] statute should be interpreted in a way that avoids placing\nits constitutionality in doubt.\u201d A. Scalia & B. Garner, Reading\nLaw: The Interpretation of Legal Texts \u00a738, p. 247 (2012). This\ncanon applies fully when considering vagueness challenges. In cases\nlike this one, \u201cour task is not to destroy the Act if we can, but\nto construe it, if consistent with the will of Congress, so as to\ncomport with constitutional limitations.\u201dCivil Service\nComm\u2019nv.Letter Carriers,413 U.\u00a0S. 548, 571\n(1973) ; see alsoSkillingv.United States, 561\nU.\u00a0S. 358, 403 (2010) . Indeed, \u201c\u00a0\u2018[t]he elementary rule\nis that every reasonable construction must be resorted to, in order\nto save a statute from unconstitutionality.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId.,at\n406 (quotingHooperv.California, 155 U.\u00a0S.\n648, 657 (1895) ; emphasis deleted); see alsoEx\u00a0parte\nRandolph, 20 F.\u00a0Cas. 242, 254 (No. 11,558) (CC Va. 1833)\n(Marshall, C.\u00a0J.).The Court all but concedes that the residual\nclause would be constitutional if it applied to \u201creal-world\nconduct.\u201d Whether that is thebestinterpretation of the\nresidual clause is beside the point. What matters is whether it is\na reasonable interpretation of the statute. And it surely is\nthat.First, this interpretation heeds the pointed\ndistinction that ACCA draws between the \u201celement[s]\u201d of an offense\nand \u201cconduct.\u201d Under \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i), a crime qualifies as a\n\u201cviolent felony\u201d if one of its \u201celement[s]\u201d involves \u201cthe use,\nattempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the\nperson of another.\u201d But the residual clause, which appears in the\nvery next subsection, \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii), focuses on\n\u201cconduct\u201d\u2014specifically, \u201cconduct that presents a serious potential\nrisk of physical injury to another.\u201d The use of these two different\nterms in \u00a7924(e) indicates that \u201cconduct\u201d refers to things done\nduring the commission of an offense that are not part of the\nelements needed for conviction. Because those extra actions vary\nfrom case to case, it is natural to interpret \u201cconduct\u201d to mean\nreal-world conduct, not the conduct involved in some Platonic ideal\nof the offense.Second, as the Court points out, standards like\nthe one in the residual clause almost always appear in laws that\ncall for application by a trier of fact. This strongly suggests\nthat the residual clause calls for the same sort of\napplication.Third, if the Court is correct that the residual\nclause is nearly incomprehensible when interpreted as applying to\nan \u201cidealized ordinary case of the crime,\u201d then that is telling\nevidence that this is not what Congress intended. When another\ninterpretation is ready at hand, why should we assume that Congress\ngave the clause a meaning that is impossible\u2014or even, exceedingly\ndifficult\u2014to apply?DNot only does the \u201creal-world conduct\u201d\ninterpretation fit the terms of the residual clause, but the\nreasons that persuaded the Court to adopt the categorical approach\ninTayloreither do not apply or have much less force in\nresidual clause cases.InTaylor, the question before the Court\nconcerned the meaning of \u201cburglary,\u201d one of ACCA\u2019s enumerated\nof-fenses. The Court gave three reasons for holding that a judge\nmaking an ACCA determination should generally look only at the\nelements of the offense of conviction and not to other things that\nthe defendant did during the commission of the offense. First, the\nCourt thought that ACCA\u2019s use of the term \u201cconvictions\u201d pointed to\nthe categorical approach. The Court wrote: \u201cSection 924(e)(1)\nrefers to \u2018a person who .\u00a0.\u00a0. has three previous\nconvictions\u2019 for\u2014not a person who has committed\u2014three previous\nviolent felonies or drug offenses.\u201d 495 U.\u00a0S., at 600. Second,\nthe Court relied on legislative history, noting that ACCA had\npreviously contained a generic definition of burglary and that \u201cthe\ndeletion of [this] definition .\u00a0.\u00a0. may have been an\ninadvertent casualty of a complex drafting process.\u201dId., at\n589\u2013590, 601. Third, the Court felt that \u201cthe practical\ndifficulties and potential unfairness of a factual approach [were]\ndaunting.\u201dId., at 601.None of these three grounds dictates that the\ncategorical approach must be used in residual clause cases. The\nsecond ground, which concerned the deletion of a generic definition\nof burglary, obviously has no application to the residual clause.\nAnd the first ground has much less force in residual clause cases.\nInTaylor, the Court reasoned that a defendant has a\n\u201cconviction\u201d for burglary only if burglary is the offense set out\nin the judgment of conviction. For instance, if a defendant commits\na burglary but pleads guilty, under a plea bargain, to possession\nof burglar\u2019s tools, theTaylorCourt thought that it would\nbe unnatural to say that the defendant had aconvictionfor\nburglary. Now consider a case in which a gang member is convicted\nof illegal possession of a sawed-off shotgun and the evidence shows\nthat he concealed the weapon under his coat, while searching for a\nrival gang member who had just killed his brother. In that\nsituation, it is not at all unnatural to say that the defendant had\na conviction for a crime that \u201cinvolve[d]conductthat\npresent[ed] a seri-ous potential risk of physical injury to\nanother.\u201d \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii) (emphasis added). At the very least, it\nwould be a reasonable way to describe the defendant\u2019s\nconviction.TheTaylorCourt\u2019s remaining reasons for\nadopting the categorical approach cannot justify an interpretation\nthat renders the residual clause unconstitutional. While theTaylorCourt feared that a conduct-specific approach would\nunduly burden the courts, experience has shown that application of\nthe categorical approach has not always been easy. Indeed, the\nCourt\u2019s main argument for overturning the statute is that this\napproach is unmanageable in residual clause cases.As for the notion that the categorical approach\nis more forgiving to defendants, there is a strong argument that\nthe opposite is true, at least with respect to the residual clause.\nConsider two criminal laws: Injury occurs in 10% of cases involving\nthe violation of statute A, but in 90% of cases involving the\nviolation of statute B. Under the categorical approach, a truly\ndangerous crime under statute A might not qualify as a violent\nfelony, while a crime with no measurable risk of harm under statute\nB would count against the defendant. Under a conduct-specific\ninquiry, on the other hand, a defendant\u2019s actual conduct would\ndetermine whether ACCA\u2019s mandatory penalty applies.It is also significant that the allocation of\nthe burden of proof protects defendants. The prosecution bears the\nburden of proving that a defendant has convictions that qualify for\nsentencing under ACCA. If evidentiary deficiencies, poor\nrecordkeeping, or anything else preventsthe prosecution from\ndischarging that burden under the conduct-specific approach, a\ndefendant would not receive an ACCA sentence.Nor would a conduct-specific inquiry raise\nconstitutional problems of its own. It is questionable whether the\nSixth Amendment creates a right to a jury trial in this situation.\nSeeAlmendarez-Torresv.United States, 523\nU.\u00a0S. 224 (1998) . But if it does, the issue could be tried to\na jury, and the prosecution could bear the burden of proving beyond\na reasonable doubt that a defendant\u2019s prior crimes involved conduct\nthat presented a serious potential risk of injury to another. I\nwould adopt this alternative interpretation and hold that the\nresidual clause requires an examination of real-world conduct.The Court\u2019s only reason for refusing to consider\nthis interpretation is that \u201cthe Government has not asked us to\nabandon the categorical approach in residual-clause cases.\u201dAnte,at 13. But the Court cites no case in which wehave\nsuggested that a saving interpretation may be adopted only if it is\nproposed by one of the parties. Nor does the Court cite any\nsecondary authorities advocating this rule. Cf. Scalia, Reading Law\n\u00a738 (stating the canon with no such limitation). On the contrary,\nwe have long recognized that it is \u201cour plain duty to adopt that\nconstruction which will save [a] statute from constitutional\ninfirmity,\u201d where fairly possible.United States ex\u00a0rel.\nAttorney Generalv.Delaware & Hudson Co., 213\nU.\u00a0S. 366, 407 (1909) . It would be strange if we could\nfulfill that \u201cplain duty\u201d only when a party asks us to do so. And\nthe Court\u2019s refusal to consider a saving interpretation not\nadvocated by the Government is hard to square with the Court\u2019s\nadoption of an argument that petitioner chose not to raise. As\nnoted, Johnson did not ask us to hold that the residual clause is\nunconstitutionally vague, but the Court inter-jected that issue\ninto the case, requested supplemental briefing on the question, and\nheard reargument. The Court\u2019s refusal to look beyond the arguments\nof the parties apparently applies only to arguments that the Court\ndoes not want to hear.EEven if the categorical approach is used in\nresidual clause cases, however, the clause is still not void for\nvagueness. \u201cIt is well established that vagueness challenges to\nstatutes which do not involve First Amendment freedoms must be\nexamined\u201d on an as-applied basis.United Statesv.Mazurie, 419 U.\u00a0S. 544, 550 (1975) . \u201cObjections to\nvagueness under the Due Process Clause rest on the lack of notice,\nand hence may be overcome in any specific case where reasonable\npersons would know that their conduct is at risk.\u201dMaynardv.Cartwright, 486 U.\u00a0S. 356, 361 (1988) . Thus, in a\ndue process vagueness case, we will hold that a law is facially\ninvalid \u201conly if the enactment is impermissibly vague inallof its applications.\u201dHoffman Estates, 455 U.\u00a0S., at\n494\u2013495 (emphasis added); see alsoChapman, 500 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 467.[2]In concluding that the residual clause is\nfacially void for vagueness, the Court flatly contravenes this\nrule. The Court admits \u201cthat there will be straightforward cases\nunder the residual clause.\u201dAnte,at 10. But rather than\nexercising the restraint that our vagueness cases prescribe, the\nCourt holds that the residual clause is unconstitutionally vague\neven when its application is clear.The Court\u2019s treatment of this issue is\nstartling. Its facial invalidation precludes a sentencing court\nthat is applying ACCA from counting convictions for even those\nspecific offenses that this Court previously found to fall within\nthe residual clause. SeeJames, 550 U.\u00a0S., at 203\u2013209\n(attempted burglary);Sykes, 564 U.\u00a0S., at ___\u2013___\n(slip op., at 5\u20139) (flight from law enforcement in a vehicle).\nStill worse, the Court holds that vagueness bars the use of the\nresidual clause in other cases in which its applicability can\nhardly be questioned. Attempted rape is an example. See,e.g.,Dawsonv.United States, 702 F.\u00a03d\n347, 351\u2013352 (CA6 2012). Can there be any doubt that \u201can idealized\nordinary case of th[is] crime\u201d \u201cinvolves conduct that presents a\nserious potential risk of physical injury to another\u201d? How about\nattempted arson,[3] attempted\nkidnapping,[4] solicitation to\ncommit aggravated assault,[5]\npossession of a loaded weapon with the intent to use it unlawfully\nagainst another person,[6]\npossession of a weapon in prison,[7] or compelling a person to act as a prostitute?[8] Is there much doubt that those\noffenses \u201cinvolve conduct that presents a serious potential risk of\nphysical injury to another\u201d?Transforming vagueness doctrine, the Court\nclaims that we have never actuallyheldthat a statue may be\nvoided for vagueness only when it is vague in all its applications.\nBut that is simply wrong. InHoffman Estates, we reversed a\nSeventh Circuit decision that voided an ordinance prohibiting the\nsale of certain items. See 455 U.\u00a0S., at 491. The Seventh\nCircuit struck down the ordinance because it was \u201cunclear insomeof its applications,\u201d but we reversed and emphasized\nthat a law is void for vagueness \u201conly if [it] is impermissibly\nvague in all of its applications.\u201dId.,at 494\u2013495; see alsoid.,at 495, n.\u00a07 (collecting cases). Applying that\nprinciple, we held that the \u201cfacial challenge [wa]s unavailing\u201d\nbecause \u201cat least some of the items sold .\u00a0.\u00a0. [we]re\ncovered\u201d by the ordinance.Id.,at 500. These statements\nwere not dicta. They were the holding of the case. Yet the Court\ndoes not even mention this binding precedent.Instead, the Court says that the facts of twoearliercases support a broader application of the vagueness\ndoctrine. Seeante,at 11. That, too, is incorrect. Neither\ncase remotely suggested that mere overbreadth is enough for facial\ninvalidation under the Fifth Amendment.InCoatesv.Cincinnati, 402\nU.\u00a0S. 611, 612 (1971) , we addressed an ordinance that\nrestricted free assembly and association rights by prohibiting\n\u201cannoying\u201d conduct. Our analysis turned in large part on those\nFirst Amendment concerns. In fact, we specifically explained that\nthe \u201cvice of the ordinance lies not alone in its violation of the\ndue process standard of vagueness.\u201dId.,at 615. In the\npresent case, by contrast, no First Amendment rights are at issue.\nThus,Coatescannot support the Court\u2019s rejection of our\nrepeated statements that \u201cvagueness challenges to statutes whichdo not involve First Amendment freedomsmust be examined in\nlight of the facts .\u00a0.\u00a0. at hand.\u201dMazurie,supra, at 550 (emphasis added).Likewise,L. Cohen Grocery Co., 255\nU.\u00a0S. 81 , proves precisely the opposite of what the Court\nclaims. In that case, we struck down a statute prohibiting\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018unjust or unreasonable rate[s]\u2019\u00a0\u201d because it provided\nno \u201cascertain-able standard of guilt\u201d and left open \u201cthe widest\nconceivable inquiry, the scope of which no one can foresee and the\nresult of which no one can foreshadow or adequately guard against.\u201dId.,at 89. The clear import of this language is that the\nlaw at issue was impermissibly vague in all applications. And in\nthe years since, we have never adopted the majority\u2019s contradictory\ninterpretation. On the contrary, we have characterized the case as\ninvolving a statute that could \u201cnot constitutionally be applied to\nany set of facts.\u201dUnited Statesv.Powell, 423\nU.\u00a0S. 87, 92 (1975) . Thus, our holdings and our dicta\nprohibit the Court\u2019s expansion of the vagueness doctrine. The\nConstitution does not allow us to hold a statute void for vagueness\nunless it is vague in all its applications.IVBecause I would not strike down ACCA\u2019s\nresidual clause, it is necessary for me to address whether\nJohnson\u2019s conviction for possessing a sawed-off shotgun qualifies\nas a violent felony. Under either the categorical approach or a\nconduct-specific inquiry, it does.AThe categorical approach requires us to\ndetermine whether \u201cthe conduct encompassed by the elements of the\noffense, in the ordinary case, presents a serious potential risk of\ninjury to another.\u201dJames, 550 U.\u00a0S., at 208. This is\nan \u201cinherently probabilistic\u201d determination that considers the\ncircumstances and conduct that ordinarily attend the offense.Id.,at 207. The mere fact that a crimecouldbe\ncommitted without a risk of physical harm does not exclude it from\nthe statute\u2019s reach. Seeid.,at 207\u2013208. Instead, the\nresidual clause speaks of \u201cpotential risk[s],\u201d \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii), a\nterm suggesting \u201cthat Congress in-tended to encompass possibilities\neven more contingent or remote than a simple \u2018risk,\u2019 much less a\ncertainty.\u201dJames,supra, at 207\u2013208.Under these principles, unlawful possession of a\nsawed-off shotgun qualifies as a violent felony. As we recognized\ninDistrict of Columbiav.Heller, 554 U.\u00a0S.\n570, 625 (2008) , sawed-off shotguns are \u201cnot typically possessed\nby law-abiding citizens for lawful purposes.\u201d Instead, they are\nuniquely attractive to violent criminals. Much easier to conceal\nthan long-barreled shotguns used for hunting and other lawful\npurposes, short-barreled shotguns can be hidden under a coat,\ntucked into a bag, or stowed under a car seat. And like a handgun,\nthey can be fired with one hand\u2014except to more lethal effect. These\nweapons thus combine the deadly characteristics of conventional\nshotguns with the more convenient handling of handguns. Unlike\nthose common firearms, however, they are not typically possessed\nfor lawful purposes. And when a person illegally possesses a\nsawed-off shotgun during the commission of a crime, the risk of\nviolence is seriously increased. The ordinary case of unlawful\npossession of a sawed-off shotgun therefore \u201cpresents a serious\npotential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d\n\u00a7922(e)(2)(B)(ii).Congress\u2019 treatment of sawed-off shotguns\nconfirms this judgment. As the Government\u2019s initial brief\ncolorfully recounts, sawed-off shotguns were a weapon of choice for\ngangsters and bank robbers during the Prohibition Era. See Brief\nfor United States 4.[9] In\nresponse, Congress enacted the National Firearms Act of 1934, which\nrequired individuals possessing certain especially dangerous\nweapons\u2014including sawed-off shotguns\u2014to register with the Federal\nGovernment and pay a special tax. 26 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7\u00a75845(a)(1)\u2013(2). The Act was passed on the understanding that\n\u201cwhile there is justification for permitting the citizen to keep a\npistol or revolver for his own protection without any restriction,\nthere is no reason why anyone except a law officer should have a\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. sawed-off shotgun.\u201d H.\u00a0R. Rep. No.\u00a01780,\n73d Cong., 2d Sess., 1 (1934). As amended, the Act imposes strict\nregistration requirements for any individual wishing to possess a\ncovered shotgun, see,e.g.,\u00a7\u00a75822, 5841(b), and illegal\npossession of such a weapon is punishable by imprisonment for up to\n10 years. See \u00a7\u00a75861(b)\u2013(d), 5871. It is telling that this penalty\nexceeds that prescribed by federal law for quintessential violent\nfelonies.[10] It thus seems\nperfectly clear that Congress has long regarded the illegal\npossession of a sawed-off shotgun as a crime that poses a serious\nrisk of harm to others.The majority of States agree. The Government\ninforms the Court, and Johnson does not dispute, that 28 States\nhave followed Congress\u2019 lead by making it a crime to possess an\nunregistered sawed-off shotgun, and 11 other States and the\nDistrict of Columbia prohibit private possession of sawed-off\nshotguns entirely. See Brief forUnited States 8\u20139 (collecting\nstatutes). Minnesota, where petitioner was convicted, has adopted a\nblanket ban, based on its judgment that \u201c[t]he sawed-off shotgun\nhas no legitimate use in the society whatsoever.\u201dStatev.Ellenberger, 543 N.\u00a0W. 2d 673, 676 (Minn. App. 1996)\n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Possession of a\nsawed-off shotgun in Minnesota is thus an inherently criminal act.\nIt is fanciful to assume that a person who chooses to break the law\nand risk the heavy criminal penalty incurred by possessing a\nnotoriously dangerous weapon is unlikely to use that weapon in\nviolent ways.BIf we were to abandon the categorical\napproach, the facts of Johnson\u2019s offense would satisfy the residual\nclause as well. According to the record in this case, Johnson\npossessed his sawed-off shotgun while dealing drugs. When police\nresponded to reports of drug activity in a parking lot, they were\ntold by two people that \u201cJohnson and another individual had\napproached them and offered to sell drugs.\u201d PSR \u00b645. The police\nthen searched the vehicle where Johnson was seated as a passenger,\nand they found a sawed-off shotgun and five bags of mari-juana.\nJohnson admitted that the gun was his.Understood in this context, Johnson\u2019s conduct\nposed an acute risk of physical injury to another. Drugs and guns\nare never a safe combination. If one of his drug deals had gone bad\nor if a rival dealer had arrived on the scene, Johnson\u2019s deadly\nweapon was close at hand. The sawed-off nature of the gun elevated\nthe risk of collateral damage beyond any intended targets. And the\nlocation of the crime\u2014a public parking lot\u2014significantly increased\nthe chance that innocent bystanders might be caught up in the\ncarnage. This is not a case of \u201cmere possession\u201d as Johnson\nsuggests. Brief for Petitioner i. He was not storing the gun in a\nsafe, nor was it a family heirloom or collector\u2019s item. He\nillegally possessed the weapon in case he needed to use it during\nanother crime. A judge or jury could thus conclude that Johnson\u2019s\noffense qualified as a violent felony.There should be no doubt that Samuel Johnson was\nan armed career criminal. His record includes a number of serious\nfelonies. And he has been caught with dangerous weapons on numerous\noccasions. That this case has led to the residual clause\u2019s demise\nis confounding. I only hope that Congress can take the Court at its\nword that either amending the list of enumerated offenses or\nabandoning the categorical approach would solve the problem that\nthe Court perceives.Notes1The Court also says that\nthe residual clause\u2019s reference to the enumerated offenses is\n\u201cconfusing.\u201dAnte,at 12. But this is another argument we\nrejected inJamesv.United States, 550 U.\u00a0S.\n192 (2007) , andSykesv.United States, 564\nU.\u00a0S. 1 (2011) , and it is no more persuasive now. Although\nthe risk level varies among the enumerated offenses, all four\ncategories of offenses involve conduct that presents a serious\npotential risk of harm to others. If the Court\u2019s concern is that\nsome of the enumerated offenses do not seem especially risky, all\nthat means is that the statute \u201csets a low baseline level for\nrisk.\u201dId., at ___ (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment)\n(slip op., at 2).2This rule is simply an\napplication of the broader rule that, except in First Amendment\ncases, we will hold that a statute is facially unconstitutional\nonly if \u201cno set of circumstances exists under which the Act would\nbe valid.\u201dUnited Statesv.Salerno, 481 U.\u00a0S.\n739, 745 (1987) . A void-for-vagueness challenge is a facial\nchallenge. SeeHoffman Estatesv.Flipside, Hoffman\nEstates, Inc., 455 U.\u00a0S. 489 \u2013495, and nn. 5, 6, 7 (1982);Chicagov.Morales, 527 U.\u00a0S. 41, 79 (1999)\n(Scalia, J., dissenting). Consequently, there is no reason why the\nno-set-of-circumstances rule should not apply in this context. I\nassume that the Court does not mean to abrogate the\nno-set-of-circumstances rule in its entirety, but the Court\nprovides no justification for its refusal to apply that rule here.\nPerhaps the Court has concluded, for some undisclosed reason, that\nvoid-for-vagueness claims are different from all other facial\nchallenges not based on the First Amendment. Or perhaps the Court\nhas simply created an ACCA exception.3United Statesv.Rainey, 362 F.\u00a03d 733, 735\u2013736 (CA11) (per\ncuriam), cert. denied, 541 U.\u00a0S. 1081 (2004)\n.4United Statesv.Kaplansky, 42 F.\u00a03d 320, 323\u2013324 (CA6 1994) (en\nbanc).5United Statesv.Benton, 639 F.\u00a03d 723, 731\u2013732 (CA6), cert. denied, 565\nU.\u00a0S. ___ (2011).6United Statesv.Lynch, 518 F.\u00a03d 164, 172\u2013173 (CA2 2008), cert. denied,\n555 U.\u00a0S. 1177 (2009) .7United Statesv.
