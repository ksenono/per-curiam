Today, the\nplurality refuses to enforce even that limited principle in the\nface of a very real statute that dictates the disposition of a\nsingle pending case. Contrary to the plurality, I would not cede\nunqualified authority to the Legislature to decide the outcome of\nsuch a case. Article III of the Constitution vests that\nresponsibility in the Judiciary alone.IAArticle III, \u00a71 of the Constitution confers\nthe \u201cjudicial Power of the United States\u201d on \u201cone supreme Court\u201d\nand such \u201cinferior Courts\u201d as Congress might establish. That\nprovision, our cases have recognized, is an \u201cinseparable element of\nthe constitutional system of checks and bal- ances,\u201d which sets\naside for the Judiciary the authority to decide cases and\ncontroversies according to law.Northern Pipeline Constr.\nCo.v.Marathon Pipe Line Co., 458 U.\u00a0S. 50, 58\n(1982) (plurality opinion). \u201cUnder the basic concept of separation\nof powers,\u201d the judicial power to interpret and apply the law \u201ccan\nno more be shared with another branch than the Chief Executive, for\nexample, can share with the Judiciary the veto power, or the\nCongress share with the Judiciary the power to override a\nPresidential veto.\u201dSternv.Marshall, 564 U.\u00a0S.\n462, 483 (2011) (internal quotation marks omitted).The Framers\u2019 decision to establish a judiciary\n\u201ctruly distinct from both the legislature and the executive,\u201d The\nFederalist No. 78, p. 466 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton), was\nborn of their experience with legislatures \u201cextending the sphere of\n[their] activity and drawing all power into [their] impetuous\nvortex,\u201did., No. 48, at 309 (J. Madison). Throughout the\n17th and 18th centuries, colonial legislatures routinely functioned\nas courts of equity, \u201cgrant[ing] exemptions from standing law,\nprescrib[ing] the law to be applied to particular controversies,\nand even decid[ing] the merits of cases.\u201d Manning, Response,\nDeriving Rules of Statutory Interpretation from the Constitution,\n101 Colum. L. Rev. 1648, 1662 (2001). In Virginia, for instance,\nThomas Jefferson lamented that the assembly had, \u201cin many\ninstances, decided rights which should have been left to judiciary\ncontroversy.\u201d Notes on the State of Virginia 120 (W. Peden ed.\n1982). And in Pennsylvania, the Council of Censors\u2014a body charged\nwith ensuring compliance with the state constitution\u2014denounced the\nstate assembly\u2019s practice of \u201cextending their deliberations to the\ncases of individuals\u201d in order to ease the \u201chardships which will\nalways arise from the operation of general laws.\u201d Report of the\nCommittee of the Pennsylvania Council of Censors 38, 43 (F. Bailey\ned. 1784). \u201c[T]here is reason to think,\u201d the Censors reported,\n\u201cthat favour and partiality have, from the nature of public bodies\nof men, predominated in the distribution of this relief.\u201dId.,at 38.Given the \u201cdisarray\u201d produced by this \u201csystem of\nlegislative equity,\u201d the Framers resolved to take the innovative\nstep of creating an independent judiciary.Plautv.Spendthrift Farm, Inc., 514 U.\u00a0S. 211, 221 (1995) .\nThey recognized that such a structural limitation on the power of\nthe legislative and executive branches was necessary to secure\nindividual freedom. As James Madison put it, \u201c[w]ere the power of\njudging joined with the legislative, the life and liberty of the\nsubject would be exposed to arbitrary control.\u201d The Federalist No.\n47, at 303 (citing 1 Montesquieu, The Spirit of the Laws).The Constitution\u2019s division of power thus\nreflects the \u201cconcern that a legislature should not be able\nunilaterally to impose a substantial deprivation on one person.\u201dINSv.Chadha, 462 U.\u00a0S. 919, 962 (1983)\n(Powell, J., concurring in judgment). The Framers protected against\nthat threat, both in \u201cspecific provisions, such as the Bill of\nAttainder Clause,\u201d and in the \u201cgeneral allocation\u201d of the judicial\npower to the Judiciary alone.Ibid.As Chief Justice\nMarshall wrote, the Constitution created a straightforward\ndistribution of authority: The Legislature wields the power \u201cto\nprescribe general rules for the government of society,\u201d but \u201cthe\napplication of those rules to individuals in soci- ety\u201d is the\n\u201cduty\u201d of the Judiciary.Fletcherv.Peck, 6 Cranch\n87, 136 (1810). Article III, in other words, sets out not only what\nthe Judiciary can do, but also what Congress cannot.Congress violates this arrangement when it\narrogates the judicial power to itself and decides a particular\ncase. We first enforced that rule inUnited Statesv.Klein, 13 Wall. 128 (1872), when the Radical Republican\nCongress passed a law targeting suits by pardoned Confederates.\nAlthough this Court had held that a pardon was proof of loyalty and\nentitled claimants to damages for property seized by the Union, seeUnited Statesv.Padelford, 9 Wall. 531, 543 (1870),\nCongress sought to block Confederate supporters from receiving such\ncompensation. It therefore enacted a statute barring rebels from\nusing a pardon as evidence of loyalty, instead requiring the courts\nto dismiss for want of jurisdiction any suit based on a pardon.\nThis Court declared the law unconstitutional. Congress, in addition\nto impairing the President\u2019s pardon power, had \u201cprescribe[d] rules\nof decision to the Judicial Department .\u00a0.\u00a0. in cases\npending before it.\u201dKlein, 13 Wall., at 146. The Court\naccordingly held that the statute \u201cpassed the limit which separates\nthe legislative from the judicial power.\u201dId., at 147.We have frequently reiterated this basic premise\nof the separation of powers. InPopev.United\nStates, 323 U.\u00a0S. 1 (1944) , the Court recognized that\n\u201cchanging the rules of decision for the determination of a pending\ncase\u201d would impermissibly interfere with judicial independence, but\nheld that such concerns were absent when Congress consented to a\nclaims settlement pursuant to its broad power \u201cto provide for the\npayment of debts.\u201dId.,at 9; seeChadha, 462\nU.\u00a0S., at 966, n.\u00a09 (Powell, J., concurring in judgment)\n(\u201cWhen Congress grants particular individuals relief or benefits\nunder its spending power, the danger of oppressive action that the\nseparation of powers was designed to avoid is not implicated.\u201d). As\nwe also explained inUnited Statesv.Sioux Nation,\n448 U.\u00a0S. 371, 398 (1980) , because Congress has \u201cno judicial\npowers\u201d to render judgment \u201cdirectly,\u201d it likewise cannot do so\nindirectly, by \u201cdirect[ing] .\u00a0.\u00a0. a court to find a\njudgment in a certain way.\u201d That sort of legislative intervention\nconstitutes an exercise of the judicial power, leaving \u201cthe court\nno adjudicatory function to perform.\u201dId., at 392. Most\nrecently, we reaffirmed the fundamental proposition that \u201cCongress\ncould not enact a statute directing that, in \u2018Smith v. Jones,\u2019\n\u2018Smith wins.\u2019\u00a0\u201dBank Markazi, 578 U.\u00a0S., at ___,\nn.\u00a017 (slip op., at 13, n.\u00a017).BAs the plurality acknowledges,ante, at\n14, the facts of this case are stark. The Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish\nBand of Pottawatomi Indians (Band) sought land on which to build a\ncasino. The Band identified a 147-acre tract of land in rural\nsouthwestern Michigan (called the Bradley Property), and in 2005\nthe Secretary of the Interior announced a final decision to take\nthe property into trust on behalf of the Band. See 70 Fed. Reg.\n25596 (2005).Fearing an \u201cirreversibl[e] change [to] the rural\ncharacter of the area,\u201d David Patchak, a neighboring landowner,\nfiled a lawsuit challenging the transfer.Patchakv.Jewell, 828 F.\u00a03d 995, 1000 (CADC 2016). The suit\nalleged that the Secretary lacked statutory authority to take the\nBradley Property into trust. The Secretary asserted several grounds\nfor dismissing the case, but this Court ultimately granted review\nand determined that \u201cPatchak\u2019s suit may proceed.\u201dMatch-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi Indiansv.Patchak, 567 U.\u00a0S. 209, 212 (2012) (Patchak\nI).Following remand, while summary judgment\nbriefing was underway in the District Court, the Band persuaded\nCongress to enact a standalone statute, the Gun Lake Trust Land\nReaffirmation Act (Gun Lake Act), to terminate the suit. Pub. L.\n113\u2013179, 128Stat. 1913. Section 2(a) of the Act provides that the\nland \u201cdescribed in .\u00a0.\u00a0. 70 Fed. Reg. 25596\u201d\u2014the Bradley\nProperty\u2014\u201cis reaffirmed as trust land, and the actions of the\nSecretary of the Interior in taking that land into trust are\nratified and confirmed.\u201dThen Congress went further. In \u00a72(b) it\nprovided:\u201cNo Claims.\u2014Notwithstanding any other\nprovision of law, an action (including an action pending in a\nFederal court as of the date of enactment of this Act) relating to\nthe land described in subsection (a) shall not be filed or\nmaintained in a Federal court and shall be promptly dismissed.\u201dWhen Congress passed the Act in 2014, no other\nsuits relating to the Bradley Property were pending, and the\nsix-year statute of limitations on challenges to the Secretary\u2019s\naction under the Administrative Procedure Act had expired. See 28\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72401(a). The Committees that recommended the\nlegislation affirmed that the statute would make no \u201cchanges in\nexisting [Indian] law.\u201d H.\u00a0R. Rep. No. 113\u2013590, p. 5 (2014);\nS. Rep. No. 113\u2013194, p. 4 (2014).Recognizing that the \u201cclear intent\u201d of Congress\nwas \u201cto moot this litigation,\u201d the District Court dismissed\nPatchak\u2019s case against the Secretary.Patchakv.Jewell, 109 F.\u00a0Supp.\u00a03d 152, 159 (DC 2015). The\nD.\u00a0C. Circuit affirmed, also based on the \u201cplain\u201d directive of\n\u00a72(b). 828 F.\u00a03d, at 1001.IICongress has previously approached the\nboundary between legislative and judicial power, but it has never\ngone so far as to target a single party for adverse treatment and\ndirect the precise disposition of his pending case. Section\n2(b)\u2014remarkably\u2014does just that.The plurality cites a smattering of \u201cnarrow\nstatutes\u201d that this Court has previously upheld.Ante, at\n14. Yet none is as brazen as \u00a72(b), either in terms of dictating a\nparticular outcome or in singling out a particular party. Indeed,\nthe bulk of those cases involved statutes that prospectively\ngoverned an open-ended class of disputes and left the courts to\napply any new legal standard in the first instance. InPennsylvaniav.Wheeling & Belmont Bridge Co., 18\nHow. 421 (1856), for example, we addressed an enactment that\npermanently altered the legal status of a public bridge going\nforward by reclassifying it as a postal road. That provision, we\nlater said, did not prescribe an \u201carbitrary rule of decision\u201d but\ninstead \u201cleft [the court] to apply its ordinary rules\u201d to determine\nwhether the redesignation of the structure meant that it was an\nobstruction of interstate commerce.Klein, 13 Wall., at\n146\u2013147. And inRobertsonv.Seattle Audubon Soc.,\n503 U.\u00a0S. 429 (1992) , the statute at issue made reference to\nspecific cases only as a shorthand for identifying preexisting\nenvironmental law requirements.Id., at 440. The statute\napplied generally\u2014\u201creplac[ing] the legal standards\u201d for timber\nharvesting across 13 national forests\u2014and explicitly reserved for\njudicial determination whether pending and future timber sales\ncomplied with the new standards.Id., at 437.EvenBank Markazi, which disclaimed a\nnumber of limits on Congress\u2019s authority to intervene in ongoing\nlitigation, did not suggest that Congress could dictate the result\nin a pending case. There, Congress inserted itself into a\nlong-running dispute over whether terrorist victims could satisfy\ntheir judgments against Iran\u2019s central bank, enacting a statute\nthat eliminated certain legal impediments to obtaining the bank\u2019s\nassets. We upheld the law because it \u201cestablish[ed] new substantive\nstandards\u201d and entrusted \u201capplication of those standards\u201d to the\ncourt. 578 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 18).But the Court inBank Markazidid not\nhave before it anything like \u00a72(b), which prevents the court from\napplying any new legal standards and explicitly dictates the\ndismissal of a pending proceeding. The Court instead stressed that\nthe judicial findings contemplated by the statute inBank\nMarkazileft \u201cplenty\u201d for the court \u201cto adjudicate\u201d before\nruling that the bank was liable.Id., at ___, n.\u00a020\n(slip op., at 17, n.\u00a020). The law, for instance, did not\ndefine the terms \u201cbeneficial interest\u201d and \u201cequitable title.\u201d The\nDistrict Court needed to resolve the scope of those phrases. Nor\ndid it decide whether the assets were owned by the bank. That issue\nwas also assigned to the court. And lastly, the statute did not\nsettle whether the assets were held in New York or Luxembourg. The\ncourt had to sort that out too. Seeibid.[1] Section 2(b) goes much further than the\nstatute inBank Markaziby disposing of the case outright,\nwresting any adjudicative responsibility from the courts. For all\nof the plurality\u2019s discussion of the Federalist Papers and\n\u201cexclusive\u201d judicial power,ante, at 5, it is idle to\nsuggest that \u00a72(b) preserves any role for the court beyond that of\nstenographer.In addition, the Court inBank Markazirepeatedly emphasized that the law was not a \u201cone-case-only\nregime.\u201d 578 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 1). The law instead\ngoverned a category of postjudgment execution claims filed by over\na thousand plaintiffs who, in 16 different actions, had obtained\njudgments against Iran in excess of $1.75 billion\u2014facts suggesting\nmore generality than is true of many Acts of Congress.By contrast, \u00a72(b) targets a single pending\ncase. Al- though the formal language of the provision\u2014reaching any\naction \u201crelating to\u201d the Bradley Property\u2014could theoretically\nsuggest a broader application, its practical operation\nunequivocally confirms that it concerns solely Patchak\u2019s suit. SeeCommodity Futures Trading Comm\u2019nv.Schor, 478\nU.\u00a0S. 833, 851 (1986) (explaining that the Court \u201creview[s]\nArticle III challenges .\u00a0.\u00a0. with an eye to the practical\neffect that the congressional action will have on the\nconstitutionally assigned role of the federal judiciary\u201d). In an\neffort to identify a set of disputes to which \u00a72(b) might apply,\nthe plurality asserts that the provision extends to any action\nrelating to the trust status of the property.Ante, at 15.\nYet as the D. C. Circuit recognized, no other cases were pending\nwhen the provision was enacted; \u00a72(b) affected \u201conly\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. Patchak\u2019s lawsuit.\u201d 828 F.\u00a03d, at 1003. And as\nthe Band concedes, no additional suits challenging the transfer\ncould have been filed under the APA\u2014or any other statute of which\nwe are aware\u2014due to the expiration of the statute of limitations.\nBrief for Respondent Band 6. The plurality thus is simply incorrect\nwhen it asserts that the Act applies to a broad \u201cclass of cases.\u201dAnte, at 8, 15. What are those cases?This is not a question of probing Congress\u2019s\n\u201cunexpressed motives.\u201dAnte, at 15. The text and operation\nof the provision instead make clear that the range of potential\napplications is a class of one. Congress, in crafting a law\ntailored to Patchak\u2019s suit, has pronounced the equivalent of \u201cSmith\nwins.\u201dIIIThe plurality refuses to \u201cjealously guard[ ]\u201d\nagainst such a basic intrusion on judicial independence.Northern Pipeline, 458 U.\u00a0S., at 60. It instead focuses\non general tenets of jurisdiction stripping. In its view, \u00a72(b)\nfalls comfortably within Congress\u2019s power to regulate the\njurisdiction of the federal courts, and accordingly does not\nconstitute an exercise of judicial power.But nothing in \u00a72(b) specifies that the statute\nis jurisdictional. That has special significance: To rein in\n\u201cprofligate use of the term \u2018jurisdiction,\u2019\u00a0\u201d this Court in\nrecent cases has adopted a \u201cbright line\u201d rule treating statutory\nlimitations as nonjurisdictional unless Congress \u201cclearly states\u201d\notherwise.Sebeliusv.Auburn Regional Medical\nCenter, 568 U.\u00a0S. 145, 153 (2013) ;Arbaughv.Y\n& H Corp., 546 U.\u00a0S. 500 \u2013516 (2006). The Gun Lake Act\ndoes not clearly state that it imposes a jurisdictional\nrestriction\u2014the term is not mentioned anywhere in the title,\nheadings, or text of the Act. Indeed, we have previously found that\nnearly identical statutory language \u201csays nothing about whether a\nfederal court has subject-matter jurisdiction.\u201dReed Elsevier,\nInc.v.Muchnick, 559 U.\u00a0S. 154, 164 (2010) .\nCompare 17 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7411(a), the statute inReed\nElsevier(\u201cno civil action .\u00a0.\u00a0. shall be\ninstituted\u201d), with \u00a72(b) (\u201can action .\u00a0.\u00a0. shall not be\nfiled or maintained\u201d).[2] And\nsince the Gun Lake Act was passed well after our series of cases\nsetting forth a clear statement rule, we may \u201cpresume\u201d that\nCongress was conscious of that obligation when it drafted \u00a72(b).United Statesv.Wells, 519 U.\u00a0S. 482, 495\n(1997) .After stretching to read \u00a72(b) as\njurisdictional, the plurality dedicates considerable effort to\ndefending Congress\u2019s broad authority over the jurisdiction of the\nfederal courts.Ante, at 7\u201310. That background principle is\nundoubtedly correct\u2014and undoubtedly irrelevant for the purposes of\nevaluating \u00a72(b). For while the greater power to create inferior\nfederal courts generally includes the power to strip those courts\nof jurisdiction, at a certain point that lesser exercise of\nauthority invades the judicial function. \u201cCongress has the power\n(within limits) to tell the courts whatclassesof cases\nthey may decide, but not to prescribe or superintend how they\ndecide those cases.\u201dArlingtonv.FCC, 569 U.\u00a0S.\n290, 297 (2013) (majority opinion of Scalia, J.) (emphasis added;\ncitations omitted). In other words, Congress cannot, under the\nguise of altering federal jurisdiction, dictate the result of a\npending proceeding.Klein, after all, drew precisely the same\ndistinction when it considered the provision stripping jurisdiction\nover any suit based on a pardon. Chief Justice Chase\u2019s opinion for\nthe Court explained that if the statute had \u201csimply\u201d removed\njurisdiction over \u201ca particular class of cases,\u201d it would be\nregarded as \u201can exercise of the acknowledged power of Congress to\nmake exceptions and prescribe regulations to the appellate power.\u201d\n13 Wall., at 145, 146. But because the withdrawal of jurisdiction\nwas a \u201cmeans to an end,\u201d founded \u201csolely on the application of a\nrule of decision,\u201d the Court held that the law violated the\nseparation of powers.Ibid.; see R. Fallon, J. Manning, D.\nMeltzer, & D. Shapiro, Hart and Wechsler\u2019s The Federal Courts\nand the Federal System 324 (7th ed. 2015) (recognizing that \u201cnot\nevery congressional attempt to influence the outcome of cases, even\nif phrased in jurisdictional language, can be justified as a valid\nexercise of a power over jurisdiction\u201d).Contrary to the plurality, I would hold that\nCongress exercises the judicial power when it manipulates\njurisdictional rules to decide the outcome of a particular pending\ncase. Because the Legislature has no authority to direct entry of\njudgment for a party, it cannot achieve the same result by\nstripping jurisdiction over a particular proceeding. Does the\nplurality really believe that there is a material difference\nbetween a law stating \u201cThe court lacks jurisdiction over Jones\u2019s\npending suit against Smith\u201d and one stating \u201cIn the case ofSmithv.Jones, Smith wins\u201d? In both instances,\nCongress has resolved the specific case in Smith\u2019s favor.Over and over, the plurality intones that \u00a72(b)\ndoes not impinge on the judicial power because the provision\n\u201cchanges the law.\u201d Seeante, at 6\u20137, 10\u201314. But all that\n\u00a72(b) does is deprive the court of jurisdiction in a single\nproceeding. If that is sufficient to change the law, the\nplurality\u2019s rule \u201cprovides no limiting principle\u201d on Congress\u2019s\nability to assume the role of judge and decide the outcome of\npending cases.Northern Pipeline, 458 U.\u00a0S., at 73.In my view, the concept of \u201cchanging the law\u201d\nmust imply some measure of generality or preservation of an\nadjudicative role for the courts. The weight of our jurisdiction\nstripping precedent bears this out. Almost all of the examples the\nplurality cites, seeante, at 10, 13, contemplated the\nwholesale repeal of a generally applicable jurisdictional\nprovision. SeeHallowellv.Commons, 239 U.\u00a0S.\n506, 508 (1916) (\u201cThe [provision] applies with the same force to\nall cases and was embodied in a statute that no doubt was intended\nto apply to all.\u201d);Caryv.Curtis, 3 How. 236, 245\n(1845); see alsoLandgrafv.USI Film Products, 511\nU.\u00a0S. 244, 274 (1994) ;Klinev.Burke Constr.\nCo., 260 U.\u00a0S. 226, 234 (1922) . The Court, to date, has\nnever sustained a law that withdraws jurisdiction over a particular\nlawsuit.The closest analogue is of courseEx parte\nMcCardle, 7 Wall. 506 (1869), which the plurality nonchalantly\ncites as one of its leading authorities.McCardlearose amid\na pitched national debate over Reconstruction of the former\nConfederacy. William McCardle, an unreconstructed newspaper editor,\nwas being held in military custody for inciting insurrection. After\nunsuccessfully applying for federal habeas relief in the circuit\ncourt, McCardle appealed to the Supreme Court, raising a broad\nchallenge to the constitutionality of Reconstruction. The Court\nheard argument on his habeas appeal over the course of four days in\nMarch 1868. Before the Court could render its decision, however,\nthe Radical Republican Congress\u2014 in an acknowledged effort to sweep\nthe case from the docket\u2014enacted a statute withdrawing the Supreme\nCourt\u2019s appellate jurisdiction in habeas cases. Van Alstyne, A\nCritical Guide to Ex parte McCardle, 15 Ariz. L.\u00a0Rev. 229,\n239\u2013241 (1973).The Court unanimously dismissed McCardle\u2019s\nappeal. In a brief opinion, Chief Justice Chase sidestepped any\nconsideration of Congress\u2019s attempt to preclude a decision in the\ncase. Faced with a \u201cplain[ ] instance of positive exception,\u201d the\nCourt held that it lacked power to review McCardle\u2019s claims. 7\nWall., at 514.The Court\u2019s decision inMcCardlehas been\nalternatively described as \u201ccaving to the political dominance\u201d of\nthe Radical Republicans or \u201cacceding to Congress\u2019s effort to\nsilence the Court.\u201d Meltzer, The Story ofEx parte McCardle,\nin Federal Courts Stories 73 (V. Jackson & J. Resnick eds.\n2010). Read for all it is worth, the decision is also inconsistent\nwith the approach the Court took just three years later inKlein, where Chief Justice Chase (a dominant character in\nthis drama) stressed that \u201c[i]t is of vital importance\u201d that the\nlegislative and judicial powers \u201cbe kept distinct.\u201d 13 Wall., at\n147.The facts ofMcCardle, however, can\nsupport a more limited understanding of Congress\u2019s power to divest\nthe courts of jurisdiction. For starters, the repealer provision\ncovered more than a single pending dispute; it applied to a class\nof cases, barring anyone from invoking the Supreme Court\u2019s\nappellate jurisdiction in habeas cases for the next two decades. In\naddition, the Court\u2019s decision did not foreclose all avenues for\njudicial review of McCardle\u2019s complaint. As Chase made clear in the\npenultimate paragraph of the opinion\u2014and confirmed later that year\nin his opinion for the Court inEx parte Yerger, 8 Wall. 85\n(1869)\u2014the statute did not deny \u201cthe whole appellate power of the\nCourt.\u201d 7 Wall., at 515. McCardle, by taking a different procedural\nroute and filing an original habeas action, could have had his case\nheard on the merits.[3]Section 2(b), on the other hand, has neither\nsaving grace. It ends Patchak\u2019s suit for good. His federal case is\ndismissed, and he has no alternative means of review anywhere else.\nSee 25 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71322(a) (providing that state courts,\nabsent the consent of the tribe, may not exercise civil\njurisdiction over trust land). Section 2(b) thus reaches further\nthan the typical jurisdictional repeal, which \u201ctakes away no\nsubstantive right but simply changes the tribunal that is to hear\nthe case,\u201dLandgraf, 511 U.\u00a0S., at 274. Because \u00a72(b)\nsingles out Patchak\u2019s suit, specifies how it must be resolved, and\ndeprives him of any judicial forum for his claim, the decision to\nuphold that provision surpasses evenMcCardleas the\nhighwater mark of legislative encroachment on Article III.Indeed, although the stakes of this particular\ndispute may seem insignificant, the principle that the plurality\nwould enshrine is of historic consequence. In no uncertain terms,\nthe plurality disavows any limitations on Congress\u2019s power to\ndetermine judicial results, conferring on the Legislature a\ncolonial-era authority to pick winners and losers in pending\nlitigation as it pleases. The Court inBank Markazisaid it\nwas holding the line against this sort of legislative usurpation.\nSee 578 U.\u00a0S., at ___\u2013___, and n.\u00a017, ___ (slip op., at\n12\u201313, and n.\u00a017, 18). The plurality would yield even that\nlast ditch.IVWhile the plurality reaches to read the Gun\nLake Act as stripping jurisdiction, Justice Ginsburg\u2019s concurrence,\njoined by Justice Sotomayor, strains further to construe \u00a72(b) as\nrestoring the Government\u2019s sovereign immunity from suit. To\nreinstate sovereign immunity after it has been waived, Congress\nmust express \u201can unambiguous intention to withdraw\u201d a remedy.Ruckelshausv.Monsanto Co., 467 U.\u00a0S. 986, 1019\n(1984) . Congress has not made that showing here. Section\n2(b)\u2014which provides that \u201can action .\u00a0.\u00a0. relating to the\n[Bradley Property] .\u00a0.\u00a0. shall be promptly\ndismissed\u201d\u2014bears none of the unmistakable hallmarks of a provision\nwithdrawing the sovereign\u2019s consent to suit.The concurrence first relies on a hunch, based\non the Court\u2019s earlier determination that Patchak\u2019s suit was not\nbarred by sovereign immunity. SeePatchak I, 567 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 224. But hunches do not make for an unambiguous expression of\nintent. Nor, of course, does one lone reference to \u201cimmunity\u201d in\nthe legislative history.United Statesv.Nordic Village,\nInc., 503 U.\u00a0S. 30, 37 (1992) (\u201c[T]he \u2018unequivocal\nexpression\u2019 of elimination of sovereign immunity that we insist\nupon .\u00a0.\u00a0. cannot be supplied by a committee\nreport.\u201d).Saving the text for last, the concurrence fails\nto identify a single instance where the Court has treated a statute\nthat does not mention \u201cimmunity,\u201d \u201cconsent to be sued,\u201d or even the\n\u201cUnited States\u201d as restoring sovereign immunity. The only basis for\nits interpretation is the purported similarity between the language\nof the Gun Lake Act and the waiver of immunity in the\nAdministrative Procedure Act. In drawing this comparison, however,\nJustice Ginsburg leaves out the critical element of that waiver.\nSeeante, at 2 (opinion concurring in judgment). In full,\nthe APA provision states that a suit \u201cshall not be dismissed\n.\u00a0.\u00a0.on the ground that it is against the United\nStates.\u201d 5 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7702 (emphasis added). Section\n2(b), as noted, contains no such reference to the sovereign.As for Justice Breyer\u2019s concurrence, \u201cdot[ting]\nall the i\u2019s,\u201d \u201csimplif[ying] judicial decisionmaking,\u201d and\n\u201celiminat[ing] the cost of litigating a lawsuit\u201d are nothing but\ncavalier euphemisms for exercising the judicial power.Ante,\nat 2. Justice Breyer assumes that \u00a72(a) is constitutionally\nunobjectionable, and that \u00a72(b) seeks the same \u201creal-world result.\u201dIbid.But if \u00a72(a) is constitutional, it is because the\nprovision establishes new substantive standards and leaves the\ncourt to apply those standards in the first instance. That is the\nrule set forth plainly inBank Markazi. And if that is so,\n\u00a72(b) does not simply supplement \u00a72(a)\u2014it short-circuits the\nrequisite adjudicative process and decides the suit outright. The\nproper allocation of authority under the Constitution is very much\npart of the \u201creal world.\u201d Pursuant to that basic equilibrium,\nCongress cannot \u201cgild the lily\u201d by relieving the Judiciary of its\njob\u2014applying the law to the case before it.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*The Framers saw this case coming. They knew\nthat if Congress exercised the judicial power, it would be\nimpossible \u201cto guard the Constitution and the rights of individuals\nfrom .\u00a0.\u00a0. serious oppressions.\u201d The Federalist No. 78,\nat 469 (A. Hamilton). Patchak thought his rights were violated, and\nwent to court. He expected to have his case decided by judges whose\nindependence from political pressure was ensured by the safeguards\nof Article III\u2014life tenure and salary protection. It was instead\ndecided by Congress, in favor of the litigant it preferred, under a\nlaw adopted just for the occasion. But it is our responsibility\nunder the Constitution to decide cases and controversies according\nto law. It is our responsibility to, as the judicial oath provides,\n\u201cadminister justice without respect to persons.\u201d 28\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7453. And it is our responsibility to \u201cfirm[ly]\u201d\nand \u201cinflexibl[y]\u201d resist any effort by the Legislature to seize\nthe judicial power for itself. The Federalist No. 78, at 470.I respectfully dissent.Notes1Not every Member of the\nCourt thought these responsibilities adequate under Article III,\nseeBank Markazi, 578 U.\u00a0S., at ___\u2013___ (Roberts,\nC.\u00a0J., dissenting) (slip op., at 12\u201313), but all save two did,\nand that\u2019s a comfortable enough margin to establish the\npoint.2The plurality suggests an\nanalogy toGonzalezv.Thaler, 565 U.\u00a0S. 134\n(2012) , which addressed in passing the familiar hurdle in habeas\nproceedings that \u201can appeal may not be taken\u201d unless a judge issues\na \u201ccertificate of appealability.\u201dId.,at 142 (quoting 28\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72253(c)(1)). But that gatekeeping\nrequirement\u2014which dates back to 1908\u2014has long been understood as a\ndirect limitation \u201con the power of federal courts to grant writs of\nhabeas corpus,\u201dMiller-Elv.Cockrell, 537 U.\u00a0S.\n322 \u2013338 (2003), and appears alongside other provisions that speak\nin \u201cclear jurisdictional language,\u201dGonzalez, 565\nU.\u00a0S., at 142 (internal quotation marks omitted). Nothing\nsimilar is at issue here.3The plurality surmises\nthatMcCardlereserved an alternative avenue for relief in\nresponse to a perceived problem under the Suspension Clause.Ante, at 9, n.\u00a04. But regardless of the basis for that\nreservation, our point is simply that, in sustaining a\njurisdictional repeal that leaves a claimant without any prospect\nfor relief, the plurality goes beyond what the Court inMcCardleupheld.",
