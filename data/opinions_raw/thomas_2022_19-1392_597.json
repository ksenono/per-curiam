    "text": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES_________________No. 19\u20131392_________________THOMAS E. DOBBS, STATE HEALTH OFFICER OF THE\nMISSISSIPPI DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH, et\u00a0al., PETITIONERSv.JACKSON WOMEN\u2019S HEALTH ORGANIZATION, et\u00a0al.on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the fifth circuit[June 24, 2022]Justice Thomas, concurring.I join the opinion of the Court because it\ncorrectly holds that there is no constitutional right to abortion.\nRespondents invoke one source for that right: the Fourteenth\nAmendment\u2019s guarantee that no State shall \u201cdeprive any person of\nlife, liberty, or property without due process of law.\u201d The Court\nwell explains why, under our substantive due process precedents,\nthe purported right to abortion is not a form of \u201cliberty\u201d\nprotected by the Due Process Clause. Such a right is neither\n\u201cdeeply rooted in this Nation\u2019s history and tradition\u201d nor\n\u201cimplicit in the concept of ordered liberty.\u201dWashingtonv.Glucksberg,521 U.S.\n702, 721 (1997) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201c[T]he idea\nthat the Framers of the Fourteenth Amendment understood the Due\nProcess Clause to protect a right to abortion is farcical.\u201dJune\nMedical Services L.\u00a0L.C.v.Russo, 591\nU.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2020) (Thomas, J., dissenting) (slip op., at\n17).I write separately to emphasize a second, more\nfundamental reason why there is no abortion guarantee lurking in\nthe Due Process Clause. Considerable historical evidence indicates\nthat \u201cdue process of law\u201d merely required executive and judicial\nactors to comply with legislative enactments and the common law\nwhen depriving a person of life, liberty, or property. See,e.g.,Johnsonv.United States, 576 U.S. 591,\n623 (2015) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment). Other sources, by\ncontrast, suggest that \u201cdue process of law\u201d prohibited legislatures\n\u201cfrom authorizing the deprivation of a person\u2019s life, liberty, or\nproperty without providing him the customary procedures to which\nfreemen were entitled by the old law of England.\u201dUnited\nStatesv.Vaello Madero, 596 U.\u00a0S. ___, ____ (2022)\n(Thomas, J., concurring) (slip op., at 3) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Either way, the Due Process Clause at most guaranteesprocess. It does not, as the Court\u2019s substantive due process\ncases suppose, \u201cforbi[d] the government to infringe certain\n\u2018fundamental\u2019 liberty interestsat all, no matter what\nprocess is provided.\u201dRenov.Flores,507 U.S.\n292, 302 (1993); see also,e.g.,Collinsv.Harker Heights,503 U.S.\n115, 125 (1992).As I have previously explained, \u201csubstantive due\nprocess\u201d is an oxymoron that \u201clack[s] any basis in the\nConstitution.\u201dJohnson, 576 U.\u00a0S., at 607\u2013608 (opinion\nof Thomas, J.); see also,e.g.,Vaello Madero, 596\nU.\u00a0S., at ___ (Thomas, J., concurring) (slip op., at 3)\n(\u201c[T]ext and history provide little support for modern substantive\ndue process doctrine\u201d). \u201cThe notion that a constitutional provision\nthat guarantees only \u2018process\u2019 before a person is deprived of life,\nliberty, or property could define the substance of those rights\nstrains credulity for even the most casual user of words.\u201dMcDonaldv.Chicago,561 U.S.\n742, 811 (2010) (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring\nin judgment); see alsoUnited Statesv.Carlton,512 U.S.\n26, 40 (1994) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment). The\nresolution of this case is thus straightforward. Because the Due\nProcess Clause does not secureanysubstantive rights, it\ndoes not secure a right to abortion.The Court today declines to disturb substantive\ndue process jurisprudence generally or the doctrine\u2019s application\nin other, specific contexts. Cases likeGriswoldv.Connecticut,381 U.S.\n479(1965) (right of married persons to obtain\ncontraceptives)[1]*;Lawrencev.Texas,539 U.S.\n558(2003) (right to engage in private, consensual sexual\nacts); andObergefellv.Hodges, 576 U.S. 644 (2015)\n(right to same-sex marriage), are not at issue. The Court\u2019s\nabortion cases are unique, seeante,at 31\u201332, 66, 71\u201372,\nand no party has asked us to decide \u201cwhether our entire Fourteenth\nAmendment jurisprudence must be preserved or revised,\u201dMcDonald, 561 U.\u00a0S., at 813 (opinion of Thomas, J.).\nThus, I agree that \u201c[n]othing in [the Court\u2019s] opinion should be\nunderstood to cast doubt on precedents that do not concern\nabortion.\u201dAnte,at 66.For that reason, in future cases, we should\nreconsider all of this Court\u2019s substantive due process precedents,\nincludingGriswold,Lawrence, andObergefell.\nBecause any substantive due process decision is \u201cdemonstrably\nerroneous,\u201dRamosv.Louisiana, 590 U.\u00a0S. ___,\n___ (2020) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 7),\nwe have a duty to \u201ccorrect the error\u201d established in those\nprecedents,Gamblev.United States, 587 U.\u00a0S.\n___, ___ (2019) (Thomas, J., concurring) (slip op., at 9). After\noverruling these demonstrably erroneous decisions, the question\nwould remain whether other constitutional provisions guarantee the\nmyriad rights that our substantive due process cases have\ngenerated. For example, we could consider whether any of the rights\nannounced in this Court\u2019s substantive due process cases are\n\u201cprivileges or immunities of citizens of the United States\u201d\nprotected by the Fourteenth Amendment. Amdt. 14, \u00a71; seeMcDonald, 561 U.\u00a0S., at 806 (opinion of Thomas, J.). To\nanswer that question, we would need to decide important antecedent\nquestions, including whether the Privileges or Immunities Clause\nprotectsanyrights that are not enumerated in the\nConstitution and, if so, how to identify those rights. Seeid., at 854. That said, even if the Clause does protect\nunenumerated rights, the Court conclusively demonstrates that\nabortion is not one of them under any plausible interpretive\napproach. Seeante,at 15, n.\u00a022.Moreover, apart from being a demonstrably\nincorrect reading of the Due Process Clause, the \u201clegal fiction\u201d of\nsubstantive due process is \u201cparticularly dangerous.\u201dMcDonald, 561 U.\u00a0S., at 811 (opinion of Thomas, J.);\naccord,Obergefell, 576 U.\u00a0S., at 722 (Thomas, J.,\ndissenting). At least three dangers favor jettisoning the doctrine\nentirely.First, \u201csubstantive due process exalts judges at\nthe expense of the People from whom they derive their authority.\u201dIbid. Because the Due Process Clause \u201cspeaks only to\n\u2018process,\u2019 the Court has long struggled to define what substantive\nrights it protects.\u201dTimbsv.Indiana, 586 U.\u00a0S.\n___, ___ (2019) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment) (slip op., at\n2) (internal quotation marks omitted). In practice, the Court\u2019s\napproach for identifying those \u201cfundamental\u201d rights \u201cunquestionably\ninvolves policymaking rather than neutral legal analysis.\u201dCarlton, 512 U.\u00a0S., at 41\u201342 (opinion of Scalia, J.);\nsee alsoMcDonald, 561 U.\u00a0S., at 812 (opinion of\nThomas, J.) (substantive due process is \u201ca jurisprudence devoid of\na guiding principle\u201d). The Court divines new rights in line with\n\u201cits own, extraconstitutional value preferences\u201d and nullifies\nstate laws that do not align with the judicially created\nguarantees.Thornburghv.American College of\nObstetricians and Gynecologists,476 U.S.\n747, 794 (1986) (White, J., dissenting).Nowhere is this exaltation of judicial\npolicymaking clearer than this Court\u2019s abortion jurisprudence. InRoev.Wade,410 U.S.\n113(1973), the Court divined a right to abortion because it\n\u201cfe[lt]\u201d that \u201cthe Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s concept of personal\nliberty\u201d included a \u201cright of privacy\u201d that \u201cis broad enough to\nencompass a woman\u2019s decision whether or not to terminate her\npregnancy.\u201dId.,at 153. InPlanned Parenthood of\nSoutheastern Pa.v.Casey,505 U.S.\n833(1992), the Court likewise identified an abortion guarantee\nin \u201cthe liberty protected by the Fourteenth Amendment,\u201d but, rather\nthan a \u201cright of privacy,\u201d it invoked an ethereal \u201cright to define\none\u2019s own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of\nthe mystery of human life.\u201dId., at 851. As the Court\u2019s\npreferred manifestation of \u201cliberty\u201d changed, so, too, did the test\nused to protect it, asRoe\u2019s author lamented. SeeCasey, 505 U.\u00a0S., at 930 (Blackmun, J., concurring in\npart and dissenting in part) (\u201c[T]heRoeframework is far\nmore administrable, and far less manipulable, than the \u2018undue\nburden\u2019 standard\u201d).Now, in this case, the nature of the purported\n\u201cliberty\u201d supporting the abortion right has shifted yet again.\nRespondents and the United States propose no fewer than three\ndifferent interests that supposedly spring from the Due Process\nClause. They include \u201cbodily integrity,\u201d \u201cpersonal autonomy in\nmatters of family, medical care, and faith,\u201d Brief for Respondents\n21, and \u201cwomen\u2019s equal citizenship,\u201d Brief for United States asAmicus Curiae24. That 50 years have passed sinceRoeand abortion advocates still cannot coherently articulate the right\n(or rights) at stake proves the obvious: The right to abortion is\nultimately a policy goal in desperate search of a constitutional\njustification.Second, substantive due process distorts other\nareas of constitutional law. For example, once this Court\nidentifies a \u201cfundamental\u201d right for one class of individuals, it\ninvokes the Equal Protection Clause to demand exacting scrutiny of\nstatutes that deny the right to others. See,e.g.,Eisenstadtv.Baird,405 U.S.\n438, 453\u2013454 (1972) (relying onGriswoldto invalidate a\nstate statute prohibiting distribution of contraceptives to\nunmarried persons). Statutory classifications implicating certain\n\u201cnonfundamental\u201d rights, meanwhile, receive only cursory review.\nSee,e.g.,Armourv.Indianapolis,566 U.S.\n673, 680 (2012). Similarly, this Court deems unconstitutionally\n\u201cvague\u201d or \u201coverbroad\u201d those laws that impinge on its preferred\nrights, while letting slide those laws that implicate supposedly\nlesser values. See,e.g.,Johnson, 576 U.\u00a0S., at\n618\u2013621 (opinion of Thomas, J.);United Statesv.Sineneng-Smith, 590 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___\u2013___ (2020) (Thomas,\nJ., concurring) (slip op., at 3\u20135). \u201cIn fact, our vagueness\ndoctrine served as the basis for the first draft of the majority\nopinion inRoev.Wade,\u201d and it since has been\n\u201cdeployed .\u00a0.\u00a0. to nullify even mild regulations of the\nabortion industry.\u201dJohnson,576 U.\u00a0S., at 620\u2013621\n(opinion of Thomas, J.). Therefore, regardless of the doctrinal\ncontext, the Court often \u201cdemand[s] extra justifications for\nencroachments\u201d on \u201cpreferred rights\u201d while \u201crelax[ing] purportedly\nhigher standards of review for less- preferred rights.\u201dWhole\nWoman\u2019s Healthv.Hellerstedt, 579 U.S. 582, 640\u2013642\n(2016) (Thomas, J., dissenting). Substantive due process is the\ncore inspiration for many of the Court\u2019s constitutionally unmoored\npolicy judgments.Third, substantive due process is often wielded\nto \u201cdisastrous ends.\u201dGamble, 587 U.\u00a0S., at ___\n(Thomas, J., concurring) (slip op., at 16). For instance, inDred Scottv.Sandford, 19 How. 393 (1857), the Court\ninvoked a species of substantive due process to announce that\nCongress was powerless to emancipate slaves brought into the\nfederal territories. Seeid.,at 452. WhileDred\nScott\u201cwas overruled on the battlefields of the Civil War and\nby constitutional amendment after Appomattox,\u201dObergefell,\n576 U.\u00a0S., at 696 (Roberts, C.\u00a0J., dissenting), that\noverruling was \u201c[p]urchased at the price of immeasurable human\nsuffering,\u201dAdarand Constructors, Inc.v.Pe\u00f1a,515 U.S.\n200, 240 (1995) (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring\nin judgment). Now today, the Court rightly overrulesRoeandCasey\u2014two of this Court\u2019s \u201cmost notoriously incorrect\u201d\nsubstantive due process decisions,Timbs, 586 U.\u00a0S., at\n___ (opinion of Thomas, J.) (slip op., at 2)\u2014after more than 63\nmillion abortions have been performed, see National Right to Life\nCommittee, Abortion Statistics (Jan. 2022), https://\nwww.nrlc.\u200corg/uploads/factsheets/FS01\u200cAbortioninthe\u200c\u200cUS.pdf. The\nharm caused by this Court\u2019s forays into substantive due process\nremains immeasurable.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*Because the Court properly applies our\nsubstantive due process precedents to reject the fabrication of a\nconstitutional right to abortion, and because this case does not\npresent the opportunity to reject substantive due process entirely,\nI join the Court\u2019s opinion. But, in future cases, we should \u201cfollow\nthe text of the Constitution, which sets forth certain substantive\nrights that cannot be taken away, and adds, beyond that, a right to\ndue process when life, liberty, or property is to be taken away.\u201dCarlton, 512 U.\u00a0S., at 42 (opinion of Scalia, J.).\nSubstantive due process conflicts with that textual command and has\nharmed our country in many ways. Accordingly, we should eliminate\nit from our jurisprudence at the earliest opportunity.Notes1*Griswoldv.Connecticutpurported not to rely on the Due Process Clause,\nbut rather reasoned \u201cthat specific guarantees in the Bill of\nRights\u201d\u2014including rights enumerated in the First, Third, Fourth,\nFifth, and Ninth Amendments\u2014\u201chave penumbras, formed by emanations,\u201d\nthat create \u201czones of privacy.\u201d 381 U.\u00a0S., at 484. SinceGriswold,the Court, perhaps recognizing the facial\nabsurdity ofGriswold\u2019s penumbral argument, has\ncharacterized the decision as one rooted in substantive due\nprocess. See,e.g.,Obergefellv.Hodges, 576\nU.S. 644, 663 (2015);Washingtonv.Glucksberg,521 U.S.\n702, 720 (1997).",
