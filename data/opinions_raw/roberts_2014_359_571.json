JOHN\nDENNISAPELon writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the ninth circuit[February 26, 2014]Chief Justice Roberts\ndelivered the opinion of the Court.Federal law makes it a\ncrime to reenter a \u201cmilitary .\u00a0.\u00a0. installation\u201d after\nhaving been ordered not to do so \u201cby any officer or person in\ncommand.\u201d 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71382. The question presented is\nwhether a portion of an Air Force base that contains a designated\nprotest area and an easement for a public road qualifies as part of\na \u201cmilitary installation.\u201dIAVandenberg Air Force\nBase is located in central California, near the coast,\napproximately 170 miles northwest of Los Angeles. The Base sits on\nland owned by the United States and administered by the Department\nof the Air Force. It is the site of sensitive missile and space\nlaunch facilities. The commander of Vandenberg has designated it a\n\u201cclosed base,\u201d meaning that civilians may not enter without express\npermission. Memorandum for the General Public Re: Closed Base, from\nDavid J. Buck, Commander (Oct. 23, 2008), App. 51; see also 32 CFR\n\u00a7809a.2(b) (2013) (\u201cEach [Air Force] commander is au-thorized to\ngrant or deny access to their installations,and to exclude or\nremove persons whose presence isunauthorized\u201d).Although the Base is\nclosed, the Air Force has granted to the County of Santa Barbara\n\u201can easement for a right-of-way for a road or street\u201d over two\nareas within Vandenberg. Department of the Air Force, Easement for\nRoad or Street No. DA\u201304\u2013353\u2013ENG\u20138284 (Aug. 20, 1962), App. 35.\nPursuant to that easement, two state roads traverse the Base.\nHighway 1 (the Pacific Coast Highway) runs through the eastern part\nof the Base and provides a route between the towns of Santa Maria\nand Lompoc. Highway 246 runs through the southern part of the Base\nand allows access to a beach and a train station on Vandenberg\u2019s\nwestern edge. The State of California maintains and po-lices these\nhighways as it does other state roads, except that its jurisdiction\nis merely \u201cconcurrent\u201d with that ofthe Federal Government. Letter\nfrom Governor Edmund G. Brown, Jr., to Joseph C. Zengerle,\nAssistant Secretary of the Air Force (July 21, 1981), App. 40. The\neasement in-strument states that use of the roads \u201cshall be subject\nto such rules and regulations as [the Base commander] may prescribe\nfrom time to time in order to properly protect the interests of the\nUnited States.\u201d Easement, App. 36. The United States also \u201creserves\nto itself rights-of-way for all purposes\u201d that would not create\n\u201cunnecessary interference with .\u00a0.\u00a0. highway purposes.\u201d\nId., at 37.As relevant to this\ncase, Highway 1 runs northwest several miles inside Vandenberg\nuntil it turns northeast at a 90 degree angle. There Highway 1\nintersects with Lompoc Casmalia Road, which continues running\nnorthwest, and with California Boulevard, which runs southwest. In\nthe east corner of this intersection there is a middle school. In\nthe west corner there is a visitors\u2019 center and a public bus stop.\nA short way down California Boulevard is the main entrance to the\noperational areas of the Base where military personnel live and\nwork. Those areas are surrounded by a fence and entered by a\nsecurity checkpoint. See Appendix, infra (maps from record).In the south corner of\nthe intersection is an area that has been designated by the Federal\nGovernment for peaceful protests. A painted green line on the\npavement, a temporary fence, Highway 1, and Lompoc Casmalia Road\nmark the boundaries of the protest area. Memorandum for the General\nPublic Re: Limited Permission for Peaceful Protest Activity Policy,\nfrom David J. Buck, Commander (Oct. 23, 2008), App. 57\u201358. The Base\ncommander has enacted several restrictions to control the protest\narea, including reserving the authority \u201cfor any reason\u201d to\nwithdraw permission to protest and \u201cretain[ing] authority and\ncontrol over who may access the installation, including access to\nroadway easements for purposes other than traversing by vehicle\nthrough the installation.\u201d Ibid. A public advisory explains other\nrules for the protest area: demonstrations \u201cmust be coordinated and\nscheduled with [B]ase Public Affairs and [Base] Security Forces at\nleast two (2) weeks in advance\u201d; \u201c[a]nyone failing to vacate\ninstallation property upon advisement from Security Forces will be\ncited for trespass pursuant to [ 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71382]\u201d; and\n\u201c[a]ctivities other than peaceful protests in this area are not\npermitted and are specifically prohib-ited.\u201d U.\u00a0S. Air Force\nFact Sheet, Protest Advisory, App. 52\u201353.The advisory states,\nconsistent with federal regulations, that anyone who fails to\nadhere to these policies may \u201creceive an official letter barring\nyou from entering Vandenberg.\u201d Id., at 55; see also 32 CFR \u00a7809a.5\n(\u201cUnder the authority of 50 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. [\u00a7]797, installation\ncommanders may deny access to the installation through the use of a\nbarment order\u201d). And for any person who is \u201ccurrently barred from\nVandenberg AFB, there is no exception to the barment permitting you\nto attend peaceful protest activity on Vandenberg AFB property. If\nyou are barred and attend a protest or are otherwise found on base,\nyou will be cited and detained for a trespass violation due to the\nnon-adherence of the barment order.\u201d Protest Advisory, App. 54.BJohn Dennis Apel is\nan antiwar activist who demonstrates at Vandenberg. In March 2003,\nApel trespassed beyond the designated protest area and threw blood\non a sign for the Base. He was convicted for these actions, was\nsentenced to two months\u2019 imprisonment, and was barred from the Base\nfor three years. In May 2007, Apel returned to Vandenberg to\nprotest. When he trespassed again and was convicted, he received\nanother order barring him from Vandenberg, this time permanently,\nunless he followed specified procedures \u201cto modify or revoke\u201d the\norder. Memorandum for John D. Apel Re: Barment Order (Oct. 22,\n2007), App. 63\u201365. The only exception to the barment was limited\npermission from the Base commander for Apel to \u201c\u00a0\u2018traverse\u2019,\nmeaning to travel .\u00a0.\u00a0. on [Highway] 1 and\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. on [Highway] 246 .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. You are not\nauthorized to deviate from these paved roadways onto [Vandenberg]\nproperty.\u201d Id., at 64. The order informed Apel that ifhe reentered\nVandenberg in violation of the order, he would \u201cbe subject to\ndetention by Security Forces personnel and prosecution by civilian\nauthorities for a violation of [ 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71382].\u201d\nIbid.Apel ignored the\ncommander\u2019s order and reentered Vandenberg several times during\n2008 and 2009. That led the Base commander to serve Apel with an\nupdated order, which informed him:\u201cYou continue to refuse to adhere to the\nrules and guidelines that have been put in place by me to protect\nand preserve order and to safeguard the persons and property under\nmy jurisdiction by failing to remain in the area approved by me for\npeaceful demonstrations pursuant to [50] U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7\u00a0797 and 32 C.\u00a0F.\u00a0R. \u00a7\u00a0809a.0\u2013[809]a.11. You\ncannot be expectedor trusted to abide by the protest guidance rules\nbased upon this behavior. I consider your presence on this\ninstallation to be a risk and detrimental to my responsibility to\nprotect and preserve order and to safeguard the persons and\nproperty under my jurisdiction. You are again ordered not to enter\nonto [Vandenberg] property, as provided in the October 22, 2007\norder. The content and basis of that order is hereby incorporated\nby reference herein, EXCEPT that your barment will be for a period\nof three (3) years from the dateof this supplemental letter.\u201d\nMemorandum for John D. Apel Re: Barment Order Dated Oct. 22, 2007\n(served Jan. 31, 2010), App. 59\u201362.Apel ignored this\nbarment order too, and on three occasions in 2010 he reentered\nVandenberg to protest in the designated area. Each time Vandenberg\nsecurity personnel reminded him of the barment order and instructed\nhim to leave. Each time Apel refused. He was cited for violating\n\u00a71382 and escorted off Base property.A Magistrate Judge\nconvicted Apel and ordered him to pay a total of $355 in fines and\nfees. Apel appealed to the Federal District Court for the Central\nDistrict of California. The District Court rejected Apel\u2019s defense\nthat \u00a71382 does not apply to the designated protest area, holding\nthat the military \u201chas a sufficient possessory interest and\nexercises sufficient control over\u201d the area. App. to Pet. for Cert.\n14a. The court also concluded that Apel\u2019s conviction would not\nviolate the First Amendment. Id., at 13a.The United States Court\nof Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that the statute\ndoes not apply. Based on Circuit precedent, the Ninth Circuit\ninterpreted \u00a71382 to require the Government to prove that it has\n\u201cthe exclusive right of possession of the area on which the\ntrespass allegedly occurred.\u201d 676 F.\u00a03d 1202, 1203 (2012)\n(citing United States v. Parker, 651 F.\u00a03d 1180 (CA9 2011)).\nThe court found that the easement through Vandenberg deprived the\nGovernment of exclusive possession of the roadway, so it concluded\nthat \u00a71382 does not cover the portion of the Base where Apel\u2019s\nprotest occurred.We granted certiorari,\n569 U. S. ___ (2013), and now vacate the judgment.IISection 1382 provides\nin full:\u201cWhoever, within the\njurisdiction of the United States, goes upon any military, naval,\nor Coast Guard reservation, post, fort, arsenal, yard, station, or\ninstallation, for any purpose prohibited by law or lawful\nregulation; or\u201cWhoever reenters or\nis found within any such reservation, post, fort, arsenal, yard,\nstation, or installation, after having been removed therefrom or\nordered not to reenter by any officer or person in command or\ncharge thereof\u2014\u201cShall be fined under\nthis title or imprisoned not more than six months, or both.\u201dApel does not dispute\nthat he was \u201cfound within\u201d the lawful boundaries of Vandenberg,\n\u201cwithin the jurisdiction of the United States,\u201d after having been\n\u201cordered not to reenter\u201d by the Base commander. \u00a71382. And\ncertainly Vandenberg would naturally be described as a \u201cmilitary\ninstallation\u201d: it is an Air Force base, which a military commander\nhas closed to the public (with limited exceptions), located on land\nowned by the United States and under the jurisdiction of the Air\nForce, where military personnel conduct sensitive missile\noperations.Against this\nstraightforward interpretation, Apel insists that \u00a71382 applies\nonly where the military exercises exclusive possession and control,\nwhich, he contends, does not include land subject to a roadway\neasement. Apel further argues that the fence enclosing Vandenberg\u2019s\noperational facilities marks the real boundary of the Base and that\nVandenberg\u2019s commander lacks authority to control the rest, or at\nleast the designated protest area. We take his arguments in\nturn.AApel asserts that the\nNinth Circuit\u2019s exclusive possession and control requirement\n\u201cderives directly from the text of \u00a71382.\u201d Brief for Respondent 23.\nIt does not. Section 1382 is written broadly to apply to many\ndifferent kinds of military places: a \u201creservation, post, fort,\narsenal, yard, station, or installation.\u201d Nothing in the text\ndefines those places in terms of the access granted to the public\nor the nature of the Government\u2019s possessory interest. See United\nStates v. Albertini, 472 U.\u00a0S. 675, 682 (1985) (\u201cThe language\nof the statute does not limit \u00a71382 to military bases where access\nis restricted\u201d).Apel contends that the\nlisted military places have histor-ically been defined as land\nwithdrawn from public use. Not so. Historical sources are replete\nwith references to military \u201cforts\u201d and \u201cposts\u201d that provided\nservices to civilians, and were open for access by them. See, e.g.,\nR. Wooster, Soldiers, Sutlers, and Settlers 64 (1987) (\u201cThe\nfrontier forts of Texas were not simply army bases occupied solely\nby military personnel. They were often bustling communities that\nattracted merchants, laborers, settlers, and dependents\u201d); Davis,\nThe Sutler at Fort Bridger, 2 Western Hist. Q. 37, 37, 40\u201341 (Jan.\n1971) (describing a 19th-century post in southwestern present\nWyoming which included a \u201csutler,\u201d a civilian merchant who set up\nshop inside the fort and sold wares both to soldiers and to\ncivilians from outside the base).The common feature of\nthe places described in \u00a71382 is not that they are used exclusively\nby the military, but that they have defined boundaries and are\nsubject to the command authority of a military officer. That makes\nsense, because the Solicitor General has informed us that a\nmilitary commander\u2019s authority is frequently defined by the\nboundaries of a particular place: When the Department of Defense\nestablishes a base, military commanders assign a military unit to\nthe base, and the commanding officer of the unit becomes the\ncommander of the base. Tr. of Oral Arg. 6\u20137.Apel responds by\ninvoking our decision in United States v. Phisterer, 94 U.\u00a0S.\n219 (1877) , which held that the term \u201cmilitary station\u201d (in a\ndifferent statute) did not includea soldier\u2019s off-base home. But\nPhisterer only confirmsour conclusion that \u00a71382 does not require\nexclusive use, possession, or control. For there we interpreted\n\u201cmilitary station\u201d to mean \u201ca place where troops are assembled,\nwhere military stores, animate or inanimate, are kept or\ndistributed, where military duty is performed or military\nprotection afforded,\u2014where something, in short, more or less\nclosely connected with arms or war is kept or is to be done.\u201d Id.,\nat 222. To describe a place as \u201cmore or less closely connected\u201d\nwith military activities hardly requires that the military hold an\nexclusive right to the property. Rather, \u201cmilitary duty\u201d and\n\u201cmilitary protection\u201d are synonymous with the exercise of military\njurisdiction. And that, not coincidentally, is precisely how the\nterm \u201cmilitary installation\u201d is used elsewhere in federal law. See,\ne.g., 10 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72687(g)(1) (defining \u201cmilitary\ninstallation\u201d as a \u201cbase .\u00a0.\u00a0. or other activity under\nthe jurisdiction of the Department of Defense\u201d); \u00a72801(c)(4)\n(defining \u201cmilitary installation\u201d as a \u201cbase .\u00a0.\u00a0. or\nother activity under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of a\nmilitary department\u201d); 32 CFR \u00a7809a.0 (\u201cThis part prescribes the\ncommanders\u2019 authority for enforcing order within or near Air Force\ninstallations under their jurisdiction and controlling entry to\nthose installations\u201d).Apel also relies on the\nfact that some Executive Branch documents, including the United\nStates Attorneys\u2019 Man-ual and opinions of the Air Force Judge\nAdvocate General, have said that \u00a71382 requires exclusive\npossession. Brief for Respondent 44\u201347. So they have, and that is a\npoint in his favor. But those opinions are not intended to be\nbinding. See Dept. of Justice, United States Attorneys\u2019 Man-ual\n\u00a71\u20131.100 (2009) (\u201cThe Manual provides only internal Department of\nJustice guidance. It is not intended to, does not, and may not be\nrelied upon to create any rights, substantive or procedural,\nenforceable at law by any party in any matter civil or criminal\u201d);\n2 Civil Law Opinionsof The Judge Advocate General, United States\nAir Force 1978\u20131983 (Preface) (opinions of the Judge Advocate\nGen-eral \u201care good starting points but should not be citedas\nprecedence [sic] without first verifying the validity of the\nconclusions by independent research\u201d). Their views may reflect\noverly cautious legal advice based on division in the lower courts.\nOr they may reflect legal error. Either way, we have never held\nthat the Government\u2019s reading of a criminal statute is entitled to\nany deference. See Crandon v. United States, 494 U.\u00a0S. 152,\n177 (1990) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment).Today, as throughout\nour Nation\u2019s history, there is sig-nificant variation in the\nownership status of U.\u00a0S. mil-itary sites around the world.\nSome are owned in fee, others are leased. Some are routinely open\nto the public, others are open for specific occasions or purposes,\nand no public access whatsoever is permitted on others. Many,\nincluding such well-known places as the Washington Navy Yard and\nthe United States Air Force Academy, have roads running through\nthem that are used freely by the public. Nothing in \u00a71382 or our\nhistory suggests that the statute does not apply to a military base\nunder the command of the Air Force, merely because the Government\nhas conveyed a limited right to travel through a portion of the\nbase or to assemble in a particular area.BSection 1382 is most\nnaturally read to apply to places with a defined boundary under the\ncommand of a military officer. Apel argues, however, that\nVandenberg\u2019s commander has no authority on the highways running\nthrough the Base or, apparently, in the designated protest area.\nHis arguments more or less reduce to two contentions: that the\nhighways and protest area lie \u201coutside the entrance to [a] closed\nmilitary installation[\u00a0],\u201d Brief for Respondent 22, and that\nthey are \u201cuncontrolled\u201d spaces where \u201cno military operations are\nperformed,\u201d id., at 23. Neither contention is sound.First, to say that the\nhighway and protest area are \u201coutside\u201d the Vandenberg installation\nis not a legal ar-gument; it simply assumes the conclusion. Perhaps\nrecognizing as much, Apel tacks: He suggests that because\nVandenberg\u2019s operational facilities are surrounded by a fence and\nguarded by a security checkpoint, the Government has determined\nthat it does not control the rest of the Base. The problem with\nthis argument is that the United States has placed the entire\nVandenberg property under the administration of the Air Force,\nwhich has defined that property as an Air Force base and designated\nthe Base commander to exercise jurisdiction. Federal law makes the\ncommander responsible \u201cfor the protection or security of\u201d \u201cproperty\nsubject to the jurisdiction, administration, or in the custody of\nthe Department of Defense.\u201d 50 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a7797(a)(2), (4);\nsee also 32 CFR \u00a7809a.2(a) (\u201cAir Force installation commanders are\nresponsible for protecting personnel and property under their\njurisdiction\u201d). And pursuant to that authority, the Base commander\nhas issued an order closing the entire base to the public. Buck\nMemorandum Re: Closed Base, App. 51; see also 32 CFR \u00a7809a.3 (\u201cany\ndirective issued by the commander of a military installation or\nfacility, which includes the parameters for authorized entry to or\nexit from a military installation, is legally enforceable against\nall persons\u201d). The fact that the Air Force chooses to securea\nportion of the Base more closely\u2014be it with a fence, a checkpoint,\nor a painted green line\u2014does not alter the boundaries of the Base\nor diminish the jurisdiction of the military commander.As for Apel\u2019s claim\nthat the protest area specifically is uncontrolled, the record is\nconclusively to the contrary. The Base commander \u201cat all times has\nretained authority and control over who may access the\ninstallation,\u201d including the protest area. Buck Memorandum Re:\nProtest Activity, App. 58. He has enacted rules to restrict the\nmanner of protests in the designated area. Protest Advisory, App.\n53. In particular, he requires two weeks\u2019 notice to schedule a\nprotest and prohibits the distribution of pamphlets or leaflets.\nId., at 52\u201353. The Base com-mander has also publicly stated that\npersons who are barred from Vandenberg\u2014for whatever reason\u2014may not\ncome onto the Base to protest. Id., at 54. And the District Court\nfound, after hearing testimony, that \u201cthe Government exercises\nsubstantial control over the designated protest area, including,\nfor example, patrolling the area.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 14a\u201315a.\nApel has never disputed these facts.Instead Apel tells us\nthat, by granting an easement, the military has \u201crelinquished its\nright to exclude civilians from Highway 1,\u201d Brief for Respondent\n36, and that the easement does not \u201cpermit[\u00a0]\u201d use by the\nmilitary, id., at 43. But the easement itself specifically reserves\nto Vandenberg\u2019s commander the authority to restrict access to the\nentire Base, including Highway 1, when necessary \u201cto properly\nprotect the interests of the United States,\u201d and likewise \u201creserves\nto [the United States] rights-of-way for all purposes.\u201d Easement,\nApp. 36. We simply do not understand how Apel can claim that\n\u201c[n]othing in the easement contemplates, or even permits, military\nuse or occupation; it provides for exclusive civil use and\noccupation.\u201d Brief for Respondent 43. Moreover, the Base commander,\nin an exercise of his command authority, has notified the public\nthat use of the roads is \u201climited to .\u00a0.\u00a0. vehicular\ntravel activity through the base,\u201d which does not include Apel\u2019s\nprotest activity. See Buck Memorandum Re: Closed Base, App. 51.Apel likewise offers no\nsupport for his contention that military functions do not occur on\nthe easement highways. The Government has referred us to instances\nwhen the commander of Vandenberg has closed the highways to the\npublic for security purposes or when conducting a military launch.\nReply Brief 12, and n. 5; Tr. of Oral Arg. 8\u20139. In any event, there\nis no indication that Congress intended \u00a71382 to require base\ncommanders to make continuous, uninterrupted use of a place within\ntheir jurisdiction, lest they lose authority to exclude individuals\nwho have vandalized military property and been determined to pose a\nthreat to the order and security of the base.In sum, we decline\nApel\u2019s invitation to require civilian judges to examine U.\u00a0S.\nmilitary sites around the world, parcel by parcel, to determine\nwhich have roads, which have fences, and which have a sufficiently\nimportant, persistent military purpose. The use-it-or-lose-it rule\nthat Apel proposes would frustrate the administration of military\nfacilities and raise difficult questions for judges, who are not\nexpert in military operations. And it would discourage commanders\nfrom opening portions of their bases for the convenience of the\npublic. We think a much better reading of \u00a71382 is that it reaches\nall property within the defined boundaries of a military place that\nis under the command of a military officer.IIIMuch of the rest of\nApel\u2019s brief is devoted to arguing that \u00a71382 would be\nunconstitutional as applied to him on this Base. But the Court of\nAppeals never reached Apel\u2019s constitutional arguments, and we\ndecline to do so in the first instance. Apel also attempts to\nrepackage his First Amendment objections as a statutory\ninterpretation argument based on constitutional avoidance. See\nBrief for Respondent 54 (\u201cthe statute should be interpreted\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. not to apply to peaceful protests on a public road\noutside of a closed military base over which an easement has been\ngranted and that has been declared a protest zone\u201d). But we do not\n\u201cinterpret\u201d statutes by gerrymandering them with a list of\nexceptions that happen to describe a party\u2019s case. \u201cThe canon [of\nconstitutional avoidance] is not a method of adjudicating\nconstitutional questions by other means.\u201d Clark v. Martinez, 543\nU.\u00a0S. 371, 381 (2005) . Whether \u00a71382 is unconstitutional as\napplied is a question we need not address.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*Where a place with a\ndefined boundary is under the administration of a military\ndepartment, the limits of the \u201cmilitary installation\u201d for purposes\nof \u00a71382 are coterminous with the commanding officer\u2019s area of\nresponsibility. Those limits do not change when the commander\ninvites the public to use a portion of the base for a road, a\nschool, a bus stop, or a protest area, especially when the\ncommander reserves authority to protect military property by, among\nother things, excluding vandals and trespassers.The judgment of the\nCourt of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for further\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so\nordered.",
