SESSIONS, III, ATTORNEY GENERAL,\nPETITIONERv.JAMES GARCIA DIMAYAon writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the ninth circuit[April 17, 2018]Justice Gorsuch, concurring in part and\nconcurring in the judgment.Vague laws invite arbitrary power. Before the\nRevolution, the crime of treason in English law was so capa-\nciously construed that the mere expression of disfavored opinions\ncould invite transportation or death. The founders cited the\ncrown\u2019s abuse of \u201cpretended\u201d crimes like this as one of their\nreasons for revolution. See Declaration of Independence \u00b621.\nToday\u2019s vague laws may not be as invidious, but they can invite the\nexercise of arbitrary power all the same\u2014by leaving the people in\nthe dark about what the law demands and allowing prosecutors and\ncourts to make it up.The law before us today is such a law. Before\nholding a lawful permanent resident alien like James Dimaya subject\nto removal for having committed a crime, the Immigration and\nNationality Act requires a judge to determine that the ordinary\ncase of the alien\u2019s crime of conviction involves a substantial risk\nthat physical force may be used. But what does that mean? Just take\nthe crime at issue in this case, California burglary, which applies\nto everyone from armed home intruders to door-to-door salesmen\npeddling shady products. How, on that vast spectrum, is anyone\nsupposed to locate the ordinary case and say whether it includes a\nsubstantial risk of physical force? The truth is, no one knows. The\nlaw\u2019s silence leaves judges to their intuitions and the people to\ntheir fate. In my judgment, the Constitution demands more.*I begin with a foundational question. Writing\nfor the Court inJohnsonv.United States, 576\nU.\u00a0S. ___ (2015), Justice Scalia held the residual clause of\nthe Armed Career Criminal Act void for vagueness because it invited\n\u201cmore unpredictability and arbitrariness\u201d than the Constitution\nallows.Id., at ___ (slip op., at 6). Because the residual\nclause in the statute now before us uses almost exactly the same\nlanguage as the residual clause inJohnson, respect for\nprecedent alone would seem to suggest that both clauses should\nsuffer the same judgment.But first inJohnsonand now again today\nJustice Thomas has questioned whether our vagueness doctrine can\nfairly claim roots in the Constitution as originally understood.\nSee,e.g., post, at 2\u20136 (dissenting opinion);Johnson,supra,at ___\u2013___ (opinion concurring in\njudgment) (slip op., at 6\u201318). For its part, the Court has yet to\noffer a reply. I believe our colleague\u2019s challenge is a serious and\nthoughtful one that merits careful attention. At day\u2019s end, though,\nit is a challenge to which I find my- self unable to subscribe.\nRespectfully, I am persuaded in- stead that void for vagueness\ndoctrine, at least properly conceived, serves as a faithful\nexpression of ancient due process and separation of powers\nprinciples the framers recognized as vital to ordered liberty under\nour Constitution.Consider first the doctrine\u2019s due process\nunderpinnings. The Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments guarantee that\n\u201clife, liberty, or property\u201d may not be taken \u201cwithout due process\nof law.\u201d That means the government generally may not deprive a\nperson of those rights without affording him the benefit of (at\nleast) those \u201ccustomary procedures to which freemen were entitled\nby the old law of England.\u201dPacific Mut. Life Ins. Co.v.Haslip, 499 U.\u00a0S. 1, 28 (1991) (Scalia, J., concurring\nin judgment) (internal quotation marks omitted). Admittedly, some\nhave suggested that the Due Process Clause does less work than\nthis, allowing the government to deprive people of their liberty\nthrough whatever procedures (or lack of them) the government\u2019s\ncurrent laws may tolerate.Post, at 3, n.\u00a01 (opinion of\nThomas, J.) (collecting authorities). But in my view the weight of\nthe historical evidence shows that the clause sought to ensure that\nthe people\u2019s rights are never any less secure against governmental\ninvasion than they were at common law. Lord Coke took this view of\nthe English due process guarantee. 1 E. Coke, The Second Part of\nthe Institutes of the Laws of England 50 (1797). John Rutledge, our\nsecond Chief Justice, explained that Coke\u2019s teachings were\ncarefully studied and widely adopted by the framers, becoming\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018almost the foundations of our law.\u2019\u00a0\u201dKlopferv.North Carolina, 386 U.\u00a0S. 213, 225 (1967) . And many\nmore students of the Constitution besides\u2014from Justice Story to\nJustice Scalia\u2014have agreed that this view best represents the\noriginal understanding of our own Due Process Clause. See,e.g.,\nMurray\u2019s Lesseev.Hoboken Land & Improvement Co.,\n18 How. 272, 277 (1856); 3 J. Story, Commentaries on the\nConstitution of the United States \u00a71783, p. 661 (1833);Pacific\nMut.,supra,at 28\u201329 (opinion of Scalia, J.); Eberle,\nProcedural Due Process: The Original Understanding, 4 Const.\nComment. 339, 341 (1987).Perhaps the most basic of due process\u2019s\ncustomary protections is the demand of fair notice. SeeConnallyv.General Constr. Co., 269 U.\u00a0S. 385,\n391 (1926) ; see also Note, Textualism as Fair Notice, 123 Harv.\nL.\u00a0Rev. 542, 543 (2009) (\u201cFrom the inception of Western\nculture, fair notice has been recognized as an essential element of\nthe rule of law\u201d). Criminal indictments at common law had to\nprovide \u201cprecise and sufficient certainty\u201d about the charges\ninvolved. 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 301\n(1769) (Blackstone). Unless an \u201coffence [was] set forth with\nclearness and certainty,\u201d the indictment risked being held void in\ncourt.Id.,at 302 (emphasis deleted); 2 W. Hawkins, Pleas\nof the Crown, ch. 25, \u00a7\u00a799, 100, pp. 244\u2013245 (2d ed. 1726) (\u201c[I]t\nseems to have been anciently the common practice, where an\nindictment appeared to be [in]sufficient, either for its\nuncertainty or the want of proper legal words, not to put the\ndefendant to answer it\u201d).The same held true in civil cases affecting a\nperson\u2019s life, liberty, or property. A civil suit began by\nobtaining a writ\u2014a detailed and specific form of action asking for\nparticular relief. Bellia, Article III and the Cause of Action, 89\nIowa L. Rev. 777, 784\u2013786 (2004); Subrin, How Equity Conquered\nCommon Law: The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in Historical\nPerspective, 135 U. Pa. L. Rev. 909, 914\u2013915 (1987). Because the\nvarious civil writs were clearly defined, English subjects served\nwith one would know with particularity what legal requirement they\nwere alleged to have violated and, accordingly, what would be at\nissue in court.Id., at 917; Moffitt, Pleadings in the Age\nof Settlement, 80 Ind. L. J. 727, 731 (2005). And a writ risked\nbeing held defective if it didn\u2019t provide fair notice.Goldingtonv.Bassingburn, Y.\u00a0B. Trin. 3 Edw.\nII, f. 27b (1310) (explaining that it was \u201cthe law of the land\u201d\nthat \u201cno one [could] be taken by surprise\u201d by having to \u201canswer in\ncourt for what [one] has not been warned to answer\u201d).The requirement of fair notice applied to\nstatutes too. Blackstone illustrated the point with a case\ninvolving a statute that made \u201cstealing sheep, or other cattle\u201d a\nfel- ony. 1 Blackstone 88 (emphasis deleted). Because the term\n\u201ccattle\u201d embraced a good deal more then than it does now (including\nwild animals, no less), the court held the statute failed to\nprovide adequate notice about what it did and did not cover\u2014and so\nthe court treated the term \u201ccattle\u201d as a nullity.Ibid.All\nof which, Blackstone added, had the salutary effect of inducing the\nlegislature to reenter the field and make itself clear by passing a\nnew law extending the statute to \u201cbulls, cows, oxen,\u201d and more \u201cby\nname.\u201dIbid.This tradition of courts refusing to apply vague\nstatutes finds parallels in early American practice as well. InThe Enterprise, 8 F. Cas. 732 (No. 4,499) (CC NY 1810), for\nexample, Justice Livingston found that a statute setting the\ncircumstances in which a ship may enter a port during an embargo\nwas too vague to be applied, concluding that \u201cthe court had better\npass\u201d the statutory terms by \u201cas unintelligible and useless\u201d rather\nthan \u201cput on them, at great uncertainty, a very harsh\nsignification, and one which the legislature may never have\ndesigned.\u201dId.,at 735. InUnited Statesv.Sharp, 27 F.\u00a0Cas. 1041 (No. 16,264) (CC Pa. 1815),\nJustice Washington confronted a statute which prohibited seamen\nfrom making a \u201crevolt.\u201dId., at 1043. But he was unable to\ndetermine the meaning of this provision \u201cby any authority\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. either in the common, admiralty, or civil law.\u201dIbid. As a result, he declined to \u201crecommend to the jury, to\nfind the prisoners guilty of making, or endeavouring to make a\nrevolt, however strong the evidence may be.\u201dIbid.[1]Nor was the concern with vague laws confined to\nthe most serious offenses like capital crimes. Courts refused to\napply vague laws in criminal cases involving relatively modest\npenalties. See,e.g., McJunkinsv.State, 10 Ind.\n140, 145 (1858). They applied the doctrine in civil cases too. See,e.g., Drakev.Drake, 15 N. C. 110, 115 (1833);Commonwealthv.Bank of Pennsylvania, 3 Watts &\nSerg. 173, 177 (Pa. 1842). As one court put it, \u201call laws\u201d \u201cought\nto be expressed in such a manner as that its meaning may be\nunambiguous, and in such language as may be readily understood by\nthose upon whom it is to operate.\u201dMcConvillv.Mayor and\nAldermen of Jersey City, 39 N.\u00a0J.\u00a0L. 38, 42 (1876).\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018It is impossible .\u00a0.\u00a0. to dissent from the\ndoctrine of Lord Coke, that acts of parliament ought to be plainly\nand clearly, and not cunningly and darkly penned, especially in\npenal matters.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId., at 42\u201343.These early cases, admittedly, often spoke in\nterms of construing vague laws strictly rather than declaring them\nvoid. See,e.g., post,at 4\u20135 (opinion of Thomas, J.);Johnson, 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___\u2013___ (opinion of Thomas, J.)\n(slip op., at 8\u201310). But in substance void the law is often exactly\nwhat these courts did: rather than try to construe or interpret the\nstatute before them, judges frequently held the law simply too\nvague to apply. Blackstone, for example, did not suggest the court\nin his illustration should have given a narrowing construction to\nthe term \u201ccattle,\u201d but argued against giving it any effectat\nall. 1 Blackstone 88; see also Scalia, Assorted Canards of\nContemporary Legal Analysis, 40 Case W. Res. L. Rev. 581, 582\n(1989) (\u201cI doubt .\u00a0.\u00a0. that any modern court would go to\nthe lengths described by Blackstone in its application of the rule\nthat penal statutes are to be strictly construed\u201d); Note,\nIndefinite Criteria of Definiteness in Statutes, 45 Harv. L. Rev.\n160, n.\u00a03 (1931) (explaining that \u201csince strict construction,\nin effect, nullified ambiguous provisions, it was but a short step\nto declaring them voidab initio\u201d);supra,at 5,\nn.\u00a01 (state courts holding vague statutory terms \u201cvoid\u201d or\n\u201cnull\u201d).What history suggests, the structure of the\nConstitution confirms. Many of the Constitution\u2019s other provisions\npresuppose and depend on the existence of reasonably clear laws.\nTake the Fourth Amendment\u2019s requirement that arrest warrants must\nbe supported by probable cause, and consider what would be left of\nthat requirement if the alleged crime had no meaningful boundaries.\nOr take the Sixth Amendment\u2019s mandate that a defendant must be\ninformed of the accusations against him and allowed to bring\nwitnesses in his defense, and consider what use those rights would\nbe if the charged crime was so vague the defendant couldn\u2019t tell\nwhat he\u2019s alleged to have done and what sort of witnesses he might\nneed to rebut that charge. Without an assurance that the laws\nsupply fair notice, so much else of the Constitution risks becoming\nonly a \u201cparchment barrie[r]\u201d against arbitrary power. The\nFederalist No. 48, p.\u00a0308 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (J.\nMadison).Although today\u2019s vagueness doctrine owes much to\nthe guarantee of fair notice embodied in the Due Process Clause, it\nwould be a mistake to overlook the doctrine\u2019s equal debt to the\nseparation of powers. The Constitution assigns \u201c[a]ll legislative\nPowers\u201d in our federal government to Congress. Art.\u00a0I, \u00a71. It\nis for the people, through their elected representatives, to choose\nthe rules that will govern their future conduct. See The Federalist\nNo. 78, at 465 (A. Hamilton) (\u201cThe legislature .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nprescribes the rules by which the duties and rights of every\ncitizen are to be regulated\u201d). Meanwhile, the Constitution assigns\nto judges the \u201cjudicial Power\u201d to decide \u201cCases\u201d and\n\u201cControversies.\u201d Art.\u00a0III, \u00a72. That power does not license\njudges to craft new laws to govern future conduct, but only to\n\u201cdiscer[n] the course prescribed by law\u201d as it currently exists and\nto \u201cfollow it\u201d in resolving disputes between the people over past\nevents.Osbornv.Bank of United States, 9 Wheat.\n738, 866 (1824).From this division of duties, it comes clear\nthat legislators may not \u201cabdicate their responsibilities for\nsetting the standards of the criminal law,\u201dSmithv.Goguen, 415 U.\u00a0S. 566, 575 (1974) , by leaving to\njudges the power to decide \u201cthe various crimes includable in [a]\nvague phrase,\u201dJordanv.De George, 341 U.\u00a0S.\n223, 242 (1951) (Jackson, J., dissenting). For \u201cif the legislature\ncould set a net large enough to catch all possible offenders, and\nleave it to the courts to step inside and say who could be\nrightfully detained, and who should be set at large[,] [t]his\nwould, to some extent, substitute the judicial for the legislative\ndepartment of government.\u201dKolenderv.Lawson, 461\nU.\u00a0S. 352, 358 , n.\u00a07 (1983) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Nor is the worry only that vague laws risk allowing\njudges to assume legislative power. Vague laws also threaten to\ntransfer legislative power to police and prosecutors, leaving to\nthem the job of shaping a vague statute\u2019s contours through their\nenforcement decisions. SeeGraynedv.City of\nRockford, 408 U.\u00a0S. 104, 108 \u2013109 (1972) (\u201cA vague law\nimpermissibly delegates basic policy matters to policemen, judges,\nand juries for resolution on anad\u00a0hocand subjective\nbasis\u201d).These structural worries are more than just\nformal ones. Under the Constitution, the adoption of new laws\nrestricting liberty is supposed to be a hard business, the product\nof an open and public debate among a large and diverse number of\nelected representatives. Allowing the legislature to hand off the\njob of lawmaking risks substituting this design for one where\nlegislation is made easy, with a mere handful of unelected judges\nand prosecutors free to \u201ccondem[n] all that [they] personally\ndisapprove and for no better reason than [they] disapprove it.\u201dJordan,supra,at 242 (Jackson, J., dissenting). Nor\ndo judges and prosecutors act in the open and accountable forum of\na legislature, but in the comparatively obscure confines of cases\nand controversies. See,e.g.,A. Bickel, The Least Dangerous\nBranch: The Supreme Court at the Bar of Politics 151 (1962) (\u201cA\nvague statute delegates to administrators, prosecutors, juries, and\njudges the authority ofad hocdecision, which is in its\nnature difficult if not impossible to hold to account, because of\nits narrow impact\u201d). For just these reasons, Hamilton warned, while\n\u201cliberty can have nothing to fear from the judiciary alone,\u201d it has\n\u201cevery thing to fear from\u201d the union of the judicial and\nlegislative powers. The Federalist No. 78, at 466. No doubt, too,\nfor reasons like these this Court has held \u201cthat themore\nimportantaspect of vagueness doctrine \u2018is not actual notice,\nbut .\u00a0.\u00a0. the requirement that a legislature establish\nminimal guidelines to govern law enforcement\u2019\u00a0\u201d and keep the\nseparate branches within their proper spheres.Kolender,supra, at 358 (quotingGoguen,supra,at 575\n(emphasis added)).*Persuaded that vagueness doctrine enjoys a\nsecure footing in the original understanding of the Constitution,\nthe next question I confront concerns the standard of review. What\ndegree of imprecision should this Court tolerate in a statute\nbefore declaring it unconstitutionally vague? For its part, the\ngovernment argues that where (as here) a person faces only civil,\nnot criminal, consequences from a statute\u2019s operation, we should\ndeclare the law unconstitutional only if it is \u201cunintelligible.\u201d\nBut in the criminal context this Court has generally insisted that\nthe law must afford \u201cordinary people . . . fair notice of the\nconduct it punishes.\u201dJohnson, 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 3). And I cannot see how the Due Process Clause might often\nrequire any less than that in the civil context either. Fair notice\nof the law\u2019s demands, as we\u2019ve seen, is \u201cthe first essential of due\nprocess.\u201dConnally, 269 U.\u00a0S., at 391. And as we\u2019ve\nseen, too, the Constitution sought to preserve a common law\ntradition that usually aimed to ensure fair notice before any\ndeprivation of life, liberty, or property could take place, whether\nunder the banner of the criminal or the civil law. Seesupra,at 2\u20137.First principles aside, the government\nsuggests that at least this Court\u2019s precedents support adopting a\nless-than-fair-notice standard for civil cases. But even that much\nI do not see. This Court has already expressly held that a\n\u201cstringent vagueness test\u201d should apply to at least some civil\nlaws\u2014those abridging basic First Amendment freedoms.Hoffman\nEstatesv.Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., 455\nU.\u00a0S. 489, 499 (1982) . This Court has made clear, too, that\ndue process protections against vague laws are \u201cnot to be avoided\nby the simple label a State chooses to fasten upon its conduct or\nits statute.\u201dGiacciov.Pennsylvania, 382 U.\u00a0S.\n399, 402 (1966) . So the happenstance that a law is found in the\ncivil or criminal part of the statute books cannot be dispositive.\nTo be sure, this Court has also said that what qualifies as fair\nnotice depends \u201cin part on the nature of the enactment.\u201dHoffman\nEstates, 455 U.\u00a0S., at 498. And the Court has sometimes\n\u201cexpressed greater tolerance of enactments with civil rather than\ncriminal penalties because the consequences of imprecision are\nqualitatively less severe.\u201dId.,at 498\u2013499. But to\nacknowledge these truisms does nothing to prove that civil laws\nmust always be subject to the government\u2019s emaci- ated form of\nreview.In fact, if the severity of the consequences\ncounts when deciding the standard of review, shouldn\u2019t we also take\naccount of the fact that today\u2019s civil laws regularly impose\npenalties far more severe than those found in many criminal\nstatutes? Ours is a world filled with more and more civil laws\nbearing more and more extravagant punishments. Today\u2019s \u201ccivil\u201d\npenalties include confiscatory rather than compensatory fines,\nforfeiture provisions that allow homes to be taken, remedies that\nstrip persons of their professional licenses and livelihoods, and\nthe power to commit persons against their will indefinitely. Some\nof these penalties are routinely imposed and are routinely graver\nthan those associated with misdemeanor crimes\u2014and often harsher\nthan the punishment for felonies. And not only are \u201cpunitive civil\nsanctions .\u00a0.\u00a0. rapidly expanding,\u201d they are \u201csometimes\nmore severely punitive than the parallel criminal sanctionsfor\nthe same conduct.\u201d Mann, Punitive Civil Sanctions: The\nMiddleground Between Criminal and Civil Law, 101 Yale L. J. 1795,\n1798 (1992) (emphasis added). Given all this, any suggestion that\ncriminal cases warrant a heightened standard of review does more to\npersuade me that the criminal standard should be setaboveour precedent\u2019s current threshold than to suggest the civil\nstandard should be buriedbelowit.Retreating to a more modest line of argument,\nthe government emphasizes that this case arises in the immigration\ncontext and so implicates matters of foreign relations where the\nExecutive enjoys considerable constitutional authority. But to\nacknowledge that thePresidenthas broad authority to act in\nthis general area supplies no justification for allowingjudgesto give content to an impermissibly vague law.Alternatively still, Justice Thomas suggests\nthat, at least at the time of the founding, aliens present in this\ncountry may not have been understood as possessing any rights under\nthe Due Process Clause. For support, he points to the Alien Friends\nAct of 1798. An Act Concerning Aliens \u00a71, 1Stat. 571;post,\nat 6\u201312 (opinion of Thomas, J.). But the Alien Friends Act\u2014better\nknown as the \u201cAlien\u201d part of the Alien and Sedition Acts\u2014is one of\nthe most notorious laws in our country\u2019s history. It was understood\nas a temporary war measure, not one that the legislature would\nendorse in a time of tranquility. See,e.g.,Fehlings, Storm\non the Constitution: The First Deportation Law, 10 Tulsa J. Comp.\n& Int\u2019l L. 63, 70\u201371 (2002). Yet even then it was widely\ncondemned as unconstitutional by Madison and many others. It also\nwent unenforced, may have cost the Federalist Party its existence,\nand lapsed a mere two years after its enactment. With this fuller\nview, it seems doubtful the Act tells us a great deal about aliens\u2019\ndue process rights at the founding.[2]Besides, none of this much matters. Whether\nMadison or his adversaries had the better of the debate over the\nconstitutionality of the Alien Friends Act, Congress is surely free\nto extend existing forms of liberty to new classes of\npersons\u2014liberty that the government may then take only after\naffording due process. See,e.g.,Sandinv.Conner, 515 U.\u00a0S. 472, 477 \u2013478 (1995); Easterbrook,\nSubstance and Due Process, 1982 S. Ct. Rev. 85, 88 (\u201cIf\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. the constitution, statute, or regulation creates a\nliberty or property interest, then the second step\u2014determining\n\u2018what process is due\u2019\u2014comes into play\u201d). Madison made this very\npoint, suggesting an alien\u2019s admission in this country could in\nsome circumstances be analogous to \u201cthe grant of land to an\nindividual,\u201d which \u201cmay be of favor not of right; but the moment\nthe grant is made, the favor becomes a right, and must be forfeited\nbefore it can be taken away.\u201d Madison\u2019s Report 319. And, of course,\nthat\u2019s exactly what Congress eventually chose to do here. Decades\nago, it enacted a law affording Mr. Dimaya lawful permanent\nresidency in this country, extending to him a statutory liberty\ninterest others traditionally have enjoyed to remain in and move\nabout the country free from physical imprisonment and restraint.\nSeeDimayav.Lynch, 803 F.\u00a03d 1110, 1111 (CA9\n2015); 8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a71101(20), 1255. No one suggests\nCongresshadto enact statutes of this sort. And exactly\nwhat processes must attend the deprivation of a statutorily\nafforded liberty interest like this may pose serious and debatable\nquestions. Cf.Murray\u2019s Lessee, 18 How., at 277 (approving\nsummary procedures in another context). But however summary those\nprocedures might be, it\u2019s hard to fathom why fair notice of the\nlaw\u2014the most venerable of due process\u2019s requirements\u2014would not be\namong them.Connally,269 U.\u00a0S.,at\n391.[3]Today, a plurality of the Court agrees that we\nshould reject the government\u2019s plea for a feeble standard of\nreview, but for a different reason.Ante,at 5\u20136. My\ncolleagues suggest the law before us should be assessed under the\nfair notice standard because of the special grav- ity of its civil\ndeportation penalty. But, grave as that penalty may be, I cannot\nsee why we would single it out for special treatment when (again)\nso many civil laws today impose so many similarly severe sanctions.\nWhy, for example, would due process require Congress to speak more\nclearly when it seeks to deport a lawfully resident alien than when\nit wishes to subject a citizen to indefinite civil commitment,\nstrip him of a business license essential to his family\u2019s living,\nor confiscate his home? I can think of no good answer.*With the fair notice standard now in hand, all\nthat remains is to ask how it applies to the case before us. And\nhere at least the answer comes readily for me: to the extent it\nrequires an \u201cordinary case\u201d analysis, the portion of the\nImmigration and Nationality Act before us fails the fair notice\ntest for the reasons Justice Scalia identified inJohnsonand the Court recounts today.Just like the statute inJohnson, the\nstatute here instructs courts to impose special penalties on\nindividuals previously \u201cconvicted of\u201d a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d 8\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a71227(a)(2)(A)(iii), 1101(a)(43)(F). Just like\nthe statute inJohnson, the statute here fails to specify\nwhich crimes qualify for that label. Instead, and again like the\nstatute inJohnson, the statute here seems to require a\njudge to guess about the ordinary case of the crime of conviction\nand then guess whether a \u201csubstantial risk\u201d of \u201cphysical force\u201d\nattends its commission. 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a716(b);Johnson, 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 4\u20135).Johnsonheld that a law that asks so much of courts while\noffering them so little by way of guidance is unconstitutionally\nvague. And I do not see how we might reach a different judgment\nhere.Any lingering doubt is resolved for me by taking\naccount of just some of the questions judges trying to apply the\nstatute using an ordinary case analysis would have to confront.\nDoes a conviction for witness tampering ordinarily involve a threat\nto the kneecaps or just the promise of a bribe? Does a conviction\nfor kidnapping ordinarily involve throwing someone into a car trunk\nor a noncustodial parent picking up a child from daycare? These\nquestions do not suggest obvious answers. Is the court supposed to\nhold evidentiary hearings to sort them out, entertaining experts\nwith competing narratives and statistics, before deciding what the\nordinary case of a given crime looks like and how much risk of\nviolence it poses? What is the judge to do if there aren\u2019t any\nreliable statistics available? Should (or must) the judge predict\nthe effects of new technology on what qualifies as the ordinary\ncase? After all, surely the risk of injury calculus for crimes like\nlarceny can be expected to change as more thefts are committed by\ncomputer rather than by gunpoint. Or instead of requiring real\nevidence, does the statute mean to just leave it all to a judicial\nhunch? And on top of all that may be the most difficult question\nyet: at what level of generality is the inquiry supposed to take\nplace? Is a court supposed to pass on the ordinary case of burglary\nin the relevant neighborhood or county, or should it focus on\nstatewide or even national experience? How is a judge to know? How\nare the people to know?The implacable fact is that this isn\u2019t your\neveryday ambiguous statute. It leaves the people to guess about\nwhat the law demands\u2014and leaves judges to make it up. You cannot\ndiscern answers to any of the questions this law begets by\nresorting to the traditional canons of statutory interpretation. No\namount of staring at the statute\u2019s text, structure, or history will\nyield a clue. Nor does the statute call for the application of some\npreexisting body of law familiar to the judicial power. The statute\ndoesn\u2019t even ask for application of common experience. Choice, pure\nand raw, is required. Will, not judgment, dictates the result.*Having said this much, it is important to\nacknowledge some limits on today\u2019s holding too. I have proceeded on\nthe premise that the Immigration and Nationality Act, as it\nincorporates \u00a716(b) of the criminal code, commands courts to\ndetermine the risk of violence attending the ordinary case of\nconviction for a particular crime. I have done so because no party\nbefore us has argued for a different way to read these statutes in\ncombination; because our precedent seemingly requires this\napproach; and because the government itself has conceded\n(repeatedly) that the law compels it.Johnson,supra,\nat ___ (slip op., at 13);Taylorv.United States,\n495 U.\u00a0S. 575, 600 (1990) ; Brief for Petitioner 11, 30, 32,\n36, 40, 47 (conceding that an ordinary case analysis is\nrequired).But any more than that I would not venture. In\nresponse to the problems engendered by the ordinary case analysis,\nJustice Thomas suggests that we should overlook the government\u2019s\nconcession about the propriety of that approach; reconsider our\nprecedents endorsing it; and read the statute as requiring us to\nfocus on the facts of the alien\u2019s crime as committed rather than as\nthe facts appear in the ordinary case of conviction.Post,at 20\u201332. But normally courts do not rescue parties from their\nconcessions, maybe least of all concessions from a party as able to\nprotect its interests as the federal government. And normally, too,\nthe crucible of adversarial testing is crucial to sound judicial\ndecisionmaking. We rely on it to \u201cyield insights (or reveal\npitfalls) we cannot muster guided only by our own lights.\u201dMaslenjakv.United States, 582 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___\n(2017) (Gorsuch, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment)\n(slip op., at 2).While sometimes we may or even must forgo the\nadversarial process, I do not see the case for doing so today.\nMaybe especially because I am not sure Justice Thomas\u2019s is the only\navailable alternative reading of the statute we would have to\nconsider, even if we did reject the government\u2019s concession and\nwipe the precedential slate clean. We might also have to consider\nan interpretation that would have courts ask not whether the\nalien\u2019s crime of conviction ordinarily involves a risk of physical\nforce, or whether the defendant\u2019s particular crime involved such a\nrisk, but whether the defendant\u2019s crime of convictionalwaysdoes so. After all, the language before us requires a conviction\nfor an \u201coffense\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0that,by its\nnature, involves a substantial risk of physical force.\u201d 18\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a716(b) (emphasis added). Plausibly, anyway, the\nword \u201cnature\u201d might refer to an inevitable characteristic of the\noffense; one that would present itself automatically, whenever the\nstatute is violated. See 10 Oxford English Dictionary 247 (2d ed.\n1989). While I remain open to different arguments about our\nprecedent and the proper reading of language like this, I would\naddress them in another case, whether involving the INA or a\ndifferent statute, where the parties have a chance to be heard and\nwe might benefit from their learning.It\u2019s important to note the narrowness of our\ndecision today in another respect too. Vagueness doctrine\nrepresents a procedural, not a substantive, demand. It does not\nforbid the legislature from acting toward any end it wishes, but\nonly requires it to act with enough clarity that reasonable people\ncan know what is required of them and judges can apply the law\nconsistent with their limited office. Our history surely bears\nexamples of the judicial misuse of the so-called \u201csubstantive\ncomponent\u201d of due process to dictate policy on matters that\nbelonged to the people to decide. But concerns with substantive due\nprocess should not lead us to react by withdrawing an ancient\nprocedural protection compelled by the original meaning of the\nConstitution.Today\u2019s decision sweeps narrowly in yet one more\nway. By any fair estimate, Congress has largely satisfied the\nprocedural demand of fair notice even in the INA provision before\nus. The statute lists a number of specific crimes that can lead to\na lawful resident\u2019s removal\u2014for example, murder, rape, and sexual\nabuse of a minor. 8\u00a0U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71101(a)(43)(A). Our\nruling today does not touch this list. We address only the\nstatute\u2019s \u201cresidual clause\u201d where Congress ended its own list and\nasked us to begin writing our own. Just as Blackstone\u2019s legislature\npassed a revised statute clarifying that \u201ccattle\u201d covers bulls and\noxen, Congress remains free at any time to add more crimes to its\nlist. It remains free, as well, to write a new residual clause that\naffords the fair notice lacking here. Congress might, for example,\nsay that a conviction for any felony carrying a prison sentence of\na specified length opens an alien to removal. Congress has done\nalmost exactly this in other laws. See,e.g.,18\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7922(g). What was done there could be done\nhere.But those laws are not this law. And while the\nstatute before us doesn\u2019t rise to the level of threatening death\nfor \u201cpretended offences\u201d of treason, no one should be surprised\nthat the Constitution looks unkindly on any law so vague that\nreasonable people cannot understand its terms and judges do not\nknow where to begin in applying it. A government of laws and not of\nmen can never tolerate that arbitrary power. And, in my judgment,\nthat foundational principle dictates today\u2019s result. Because I\nunderstand them to be consistent with what I have said here, I join\nParts I, III, IV\u2013B, and V of the Court\u2019s opinion and concur in the\njudgment.Notes1Many state courts also\nheld vague laws ineffectual.
