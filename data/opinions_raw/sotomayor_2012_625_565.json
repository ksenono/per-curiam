CORSON, DECEASED, et\u00a0al., PETITIONERSv.RAILROAD FRICTION PRODUCTS CORPORATION et\u00a0al.on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the third circuit[February 29, 2012]Justice Sotomayor, with whom Justice Ginsburg\nand Justice Breyer join, concurring in part and dissenting in\npart.I concur in the Court\u2019s holding that the\nLocomotive Inspection Act (LIA), 49 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a720701et\u00a0seq.,pre-empts petitioners\u2019 tort claims for\ndefective design, but I respectfully dissent from the Court\u2019s\nholding that the same is true of petitioners\u2019 claims for failure to\nwarn. In my view, the latter escape pre-emption because they impose\nno state-law requirements in the field reserved for federal\nregulation: \u201cthe equipment of locomotives.\u201dNapierv.Atlantic Coast Line R. Co.,272\nU.S. 605, 612 (1926).IStatutorystare decisiscompels me to\nagree that the LIA occupies \u201cthe field of regulating locomotive\nequipment used on a highway of interstate commerce.\u201dId.,at\n607. Perhaps this Court might decideNapierdifferently\ntoday. The LIA lacks an express pre-emption clause, and \u201cour recent\ncases have frequently rejected field pre-emption in the absence of\nstatutory language expressly requiring it.\u201dCamps\nNewfound/Owatonna, Inc.v.Town of Harrison,520 U.S.\n564, 617 (1997) (Thomas, J., dissenting). The LIA contains no\nsubstantive regulations, let alone a \u201cscheme of federal regulation\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. so pervasive as to make reasonable the inference\nthat Congress left no room for the States to supplement it.\u201dRicev.Santa Fe Elevator Corp.,331 U.S.\n218, 230 (1947). Instead of relying on such indications of\nCongress\u2019 intent to oust state law,Napierimplied field\npre-emption from the LIA\u2019s mere delegation of regulatory authority\nto the Interstate Commerce Commission. Compare 272 U.\u00a0S., at\n612\u2013613, with,e.g., Hillsborough Countyv.Automated\nMedical Laboratories, Inc.,471 U.S.\n707, 717 (1985), andNew York State Dept. of Social\nServs.v.Dublino,413 U.S.\n405, 415 (1973). Nonetheless,Napier\u2019s construction of\nthe LIA has been settled law for 85 years, and\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018[c]onsiderations ofstare decisishave special force\nin the area of statutory interpretation.\u2019\u00a0\u201dHiltonv.South Carolina Public Railways Comm\u2019n,502 U.S.\n197, 202 (1991).Consistent with the values served by statutorystare decisis, however, it is important to be precise about\nwhatNapierheld:Napierdefined the pre-empted field\nas the physical composition of locomotive equipment. See 272\nU.\u00a0S., at 611 (\u201c[T]he power delegated .\u00a0.\u00a0. by the\n[LIA] .\u00a0.\u00a0. extends to the design, the construction, and\nthe material of every part of the locomotive and tender and of all\nappurtenances\u201d);id.,at 612 (\u201cThe federal and the state\nstatutes are directed to the same subject\u2014the equipment of\nlocomotives. They operate upon the same object\u201d); see also Act of\nJune 7, 1924, \u00a72, 43Stat. 659 (making the LIA\u2019s standard of care\napplicable to the \u201clocomotive, its boiler, tender, and all parts\nand appurtenances thereof\u201d). Petitioners\u2019 defective-design claims\nfall within the pre-empted field because they would impose\nstate-law requirements on a locomotive\u2019s physical makeup. Seeante,at 7\u20138.IIPetitioners\u2019 failure-to-warn claims, by\ncontrast, proceed on a fundamentally different theory of tort\nliability that does not implicate a product\u2019s physical composition\nat all. A failure-to-warn claim asks nothing of a product\u2019s de-\nsign, but requires instead that a manufacturer caution of\nnonobvious dangers and provide instructions for safe use. Indeed, a\nproduct may be flawlessly designed and still subject its\nmanufacturer or seller to liability for lack of adequate\ninstructions or warnings. See,e.g.,Madden, The Duty To\nWarn in Products Liability: Contours and Criticism, 89 W.\u00a0Va.\nL.\u00a0Rev. 221 (1987) (\u201cAlthough a product is unerringly\ndesigned, manufactured and assembled, injury or damage occasioned\nby its intended or reasonably foreseeable use may subject the\nseller to liability. Such liability may be found if the product has\na potential for injury that is not readily apparent to the user\u201d\n(cited in Restatement (Third) of Torts: Products Liability \u00a72,\nReporter\u2019s Note, Commenti, n. 1 (1997) (hereinafter\nRestatement)); see also Madden, 89 W.\u00a0Va. L.\u00a0Rev., at\n221, n.\u00a01 (collecting cases). Petitioners\u2019 complaint embodies\njust this conceptual distinction. Compare App. 22\u201323, \u00b6\u00b610(c)\u2013(e),\n(g), withid.,at 25, \u00b610(p).[1]In the jurisdictions relevant to this suit,\nfailure to warn is \u201ca distinct cause of action under the theory of\nstrict products liability.\u201dRileyv.American Honda Motor\nCo., 259 Mont. 128, 132, 856 P.2d 196, 198 (1993). Thus,\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018a failure to warn of an injury[-]causing risk associated\nwith the use of a technically pure and fit product can render such\nproduct unreasonably dangerous.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIbid.;see also,e.g., Jahnigv.Coisman,283 N.W.2d 557, 560 (S.\u00a0D. 1979) (\u201cIn products liability\nsuits based upon strict liability, .\u00a0.\u00a0. the product\nitself need not be defective. Where a manufacturer or seller has\nreason to anticipate that danger may result from a particular use\nof his product, and he fails to give adequate warning of such a\ndanger, the product sold without such warning is in a defective\ncondition within the strict liability doctrine\u201d);Greinerv.Volkswagenwerk Aktiengeselleschaft, 540 F.2d 85, 92\u201393 (CA3\n1976) (finding that \u201cfailure to adequately warn of inherent or\nlatent limitations in a product, which do not necessarily amount to\na design defect\u201d is \u201can independent basis of liability\u201d under\nPennsylvania law).[2]Similarly, this Court has explained that a\nfailure-to-warn claim is \u201cnarrower\u201d than a claim that alleges a\ndefect in the underlying product.Wyethv.Levine,555 U.S.\n555, 565 (2009). Thus inWyeth, this Court affirmed a\nstate damages award based on a drug manufacturer\u2019s failure to\nprovide sufficient warnings to clinicians against intravenous\nadministration of the drug, but noted that it was unnecessary to\ndecide \u201cwhether a state rule proscribing intravenous administration\nwould be pre-empted.\u201dIbid.Cf.Batesv.Dow\nAgrosciences LLC,544 U.S.\n431, 444 (2005) (\u201cRules that require manufacturers to design\nreasonably safe products .\u00a0.\u00a0. plainly do not qualify as\nrequirements for \u2018labeling or packaging.\u2019 None of these common-law\nrules requires that manufacturers label or package their products\nin any particular way\u201d).The majority treats defective-design and\nfailure-to-warn claims as congruent, reasoning that each asserts a\nproduct defect. Seeante,at 8\u20139 (citing Restatement \u00a72(c)\nand Commentl). That may be true at a high level of gener-\nality, but \u201c[d]esign and failure-to-warn claims .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nrest on different factual allegations and distinct legal concepts.\u201d\nRestatement \u00a72, at 35, Commentn. For example, a\nmanufacturer or seller cannot escape liability for an unreasonably\nunsafe design merely by issuing a warning. Seeid.,at 33,\nCommentl(\u201cWarnings are not .\u00a0.\u00a0. a substitute\nfor the provision of a reasonably safe design\u201d). In a fundamental\nsense, therefore, a failure-to-warn claim proceeds by taking a\nproduct\u2019s physical design as a given. A failure-to-warn claim\nalleges a \u201cdefect\u201d by asserting that a product, as designed, is\nsafe for use only when accompanied by a warning\u2014not that a product\nmust be designed differently.The majority further conflates defective-design\nand failure-to-warn claims by noting that each is \u201cdirected at\u201d\nlocomotive equipment.Ante,at 9. That is insufficient. Not\nevery state law that \u201ccould be said to affect tangentially\u201d matters\nwithin the regulated field is pre-empted.Englishv.General Elec. Co.,496 U.S.\n72, 85 (1990). Rather, \u201cfor a state law to fall within the\npre-empted zone, it must have some direct and substantial effect\u201d\non the primary conduct of entities subject to federal regulation.Ibid.As explained above, the LIA regulates the physical\nequipment of locomotives. But petitioners\u2019 failure-to-warn claims,\nif successful, would have no necessary effect on the physical\nequipment of locomotives at all, as respondents themselves\nacknowledge. See Brief for Respondents 55 (petitioners\u2019\nfailure-to-warn claims \u201cmay not themselves literally mandate\nphysical alteration of the locomotive\u2019s design or\nconstruction\u201d).In the majority\u2019s view, a \u201cduty to warn and the\naccompanying threat of liability will inevitably influence\u201d a\nmanufacturer\u2019s design choices.Ante,at 9, n.\u00a04. But an\n\u201cinfluence\u201d is not the same as an \u201ceffect,\u201d and not every state law\nwith some imaginable impact on matters within a federally regulated\nfield is, for that reason alone, pre-empted. SeeEnglish,\n496 U.\u00a0S., at 85\u201386;Silkwoodv.Kerr-McGee\nCorp.,464 U.S.\n238, 256 (1984). Indeed, the majority elides the distinction\nbetween indirect and direct regulation, even though this Court has\nexplained that the two are not equivalent for pre-emption purposes.\nSeeGoodyear Atomic Corp.v.Miller,486 U.S.\n174, 186 (1988) (\u201cCongress may reasonably determine that\nincidental reg- ulatory pressure is acceptable, whereas direct\nregulatory authority is not\u201d). State wage-and-hour laws, work-\nplace safety standards, or tax credits for green technology, for\nexample, could all \u201cinfluence\u201d the means and materials of\nlocomotive equipment manufacture without imposing direct\nobligations. Nor does the majority substantiate its assertion that\nthe \u201cinfluence\u201d exerted by a duty to warn need be \u201cinevitabl[e]\u201d or\n\u201csubstantial.\u201dAnte,at 9, n.\u00a04. To the contrary, the\nrequirements imposed by such a duty could be light, and the\ncorresponding liability negligible, in comparison to the commercial\nvalue of retaining an existing design.Respondents could have complied with state-law\nduties to warn by providing instructions for the safe maintenance\nof asbestos-containing locomotive parts in equipment man- uals.\nSee,e.g.,Baldwin-Lima-Hamilton Corp., Engine Manual for\n600 Series Diesel Engines (1951), online at\nhttp://www.rr-fallenflags.org/manual/blh-6em.html (last visited\nFeb. 27, 2012, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file). Or\nrespondents could have ensured that repair shops posted signs. See\nRestatement \u00a72, at 29\u201330, Commenti(duty to warn \u201cmay\nrequire that instructions and warnings be given not only to\npurchasers, users, and consumers, but also to others who a\nreasonable seller should know will be in a position to reduce or\navoid the risk of harm\u201d); see also,e.g.,Patchv.Hillerich & Bradsby Co., 361 Mont. 241, 246, 257 P.3d\n383, 388 (2011) (\u201cWhile placing a warning directly on a product is\none method of warning, other methods of warning exist, including,\nbut not limited to, issuing oral warnings and placing warnings in\nadvertisements, posters, and media releases\u201d). Neither step would\nencroach on the pre-empted field of locomotives\u2019 \u201cphysical\nelements.\u201dNapier, 272 U.\u00a0S., at 612. The majority is\ntherefore wrong to say that \u201cthe \u2018gravamen\u2019 of petitioners\u2019\nfailure-to-warn claims \u2018is still that [Corson] suffered harmful\nconsequences as a result of his exposure to asbestos contained in\nlocomotive parts and appurtenances.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAnte,at 8\u20139\n(quotingKurnsv.A. W. Chesteron, Inc., 620 F.3d\n392, 398, n.\u00a08 (CA3 2010)). Rather, the \u201cgravamen\u201d of these\nclaims is that petitioners\u2019 decedent George Corson could have\navoided the harmful consequences of exposure to asbestos while\nrepairing precisely the same locomotive parts had respondents\ncautioned him, for example, to wear a mask.Finally, preserving petitioners\u2019 failure-to-warn\nclaims coheres with the LIA\u2019s regulatory regime. Neither the\nInterstate Commerce Commission, to which Congress first delegated\nauthority under the LIA, nor the Federal Railroad Administration\n(FRA), to whom that authority now belongs, has ever regulated\nlocomotive repair and maintenance. To the contrary, the FRA takes\nthe position that it lacks power under the LIA to regulate within\nlocomotive maintenance and repair facilities. Brief for United\nStates asAmicus CuriaeinJohn Crane, Inc.v.Atwell, O.\u00a0T. 2010, No. 10\u2013272, p.\u00a010 (\u201c[T]he\nfield covered by the LIA does not include requirements concerning\nthe repair of locomotives that are not in use\u201d); Brief for United\nStates asAmicus Curiae13 (\u201cThe preempted field\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. does not include tort claims based on injuries\narising when locomotives are not in use\u201d). The FRA has determined\nthat the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, not itself,\nbears primary responsibility for workplace safety, including with\nrespect to hazardous materials. 43 Fed. Reg. 10583\u201310590 (1978);\ncf.,e.g.,English, 496 U.\u00a0S., at 83, and\nn.\u00a06. And the FRA has not promulgated regulations that address\nwarnings specific to maintenance and repair. Because the pre-empted\nfield is congruent with the regulated field, see,e.g.,United Statesv.Locke,529 U.S.\n89, 112 (2000), the majority\u2019s decision sweeps far too\nbroadly.[3]*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*In short, the majority affords the LIA\nfield-pre-emptive effect well beyond whatNapierrequires,\nleaving petitioners without a remedy for what they allege was fatal\nex- posure to asbestos in repair facilities. \u201cIt is difficult to\nbelieve that Congress would, without comment, remove all means of\njudicial recourse for those injured by illegal conduct.\u201dSilkwood, 464 U.\u00a0S., at 251. That is doubly true in\nlight of the LIA\u2019s \u201cpurpose .\u00a0.\u00a0. of facilitating\nemployee recovery, not of restricting such recovery or making it\nimpossible.\u201dUriev.Thompson,337 U.S.\n163, 189 (1949).I therefore concur in part and dissent in\npart.Notes1Nor do petitioners\u2019\nfailure-to-warn claims allege that respondents\u2019 locomotive parts\nshould have been altered, for example, by affixing warnings to the\nproducts themselves. See App. 22\u201323, \u00b6\u00b610(c)\u2013(e), (g);id.,at 27, \u00b612(d).2Petitioners brought suit\nin Pennsylvania, but alleged that their decedent, George Corson,\nwas exposed to asbestos at railroad maintenance and repair shops in\nMontana and South Dakota.Id.,at 42, \u00b6\u00b66\u20137. Because the\nDistrict Court granted summary judgment on the issue of\npre-emption, it performed no choice-of-law analysis to identify the\napplicable substantive state law. See App. to Pet. for Cert.\n22a\u201339a.3Disagreeing with the\nagency\u2019s interpretation, Justice Kagan concludes that the LIA\nempowers the FRA to require warnings as an incident of the\nauthority to prescribe locomotive design. Compareante,2\u20133\n(concurring opinion), with,e.g.,Tr. of Oral Arg. 22\u201323.\nSuch power, if it exists, must be limited to warnings that impose\ndirect requirements on the physical composition of locomotive\nequipment. Cf. n.\u00a01,supra; 49 CFR \u00a7\u00a7229.85, 229.113\n(2010). That may be a formal line, but it is the line that this\nCourt drew in describing the scope of the authority conferred by\nthe LIA, and therefore the pre-empted field. SeeNapierv.Atlantic Coast Line R. Co.,272 U.S.\n605, 611\u2013612 (1926). And it is the line that separates\npetitioners\u2019 design-defect claims from their claims for failure to\nwarn.",
