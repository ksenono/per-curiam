Thus, where Congress has not prescribed\nspecific rules, federal courts must develop the \u201camalgam of\ntraditional common-law rules, modifications of those rules, and\nnewly created rules\u201d that forms the general maritime law.East\nRiver S.\u00a0S. Corp.v.Transamerica Delaval Inc.,476 U.S.\n858, 864\u2013865 (1986). But maritime law is no longer solely the\nprovince of the Federal Judiciary. \u201cCongress and the States have\nlegislated extensively in these areas.\u201dMilesv.Apex\nMarine Corp.,498 U.S.\n19, 27 (1990). When exercising its inherent common-law\nauthority, \u201can admiralty court should look primarily to these\nlegislative enactments for policy guidance.\u201dIbid.We may\ndepart from the policies found in the statutory scheme in discrete\ninstances based on long-established history, see,e.g.,Atlantic Sounding Co.v.Townsend,557 U.S.\n404, 424\u2013425 (2009), but we do so cautiously in light of\nCongress\u2019s persistent pursuit of \u201cuniformity in the exercise of\nadmiralty jurisdiction.\u201dMiles,supra, at 26 (quotingMoragnev.States Marine Lines,Inc.,398\nU.S. 375, 401 (1970)).This case asks whether a mariner may recover\npunitive damages on a claim that he was injured as a result of the\nunseaworthy condition of the vessel. We have twice confronted\nsimilar questions in the past several decades, and our holdings in\nboth cases were based on the particular claims involved. InMiles, which concerned a wrongful-death claim under the\ngeneral maritime law, we held that recovery was limited to\npecuniary damages, which did not include loss of society. 498\nU.\u00a0S., at 23. And inAtlantic Sounding, after examining\ncenturies of relevant case law, we held that punitive damages are\nnot categorically barred as part of the award on the traditional\nmaritime claim of maintenance and cure. 557 U.\u00a0S., at 407.\nHere, because there is no historical basis for allowing punitive\ndamages in unseaworthiness actions, and in order to promote\nuniformity with the way courts have applied parallel statutory\ncauses of action, we hold that punitive damages remain unavailable\nin unseaworthiness actions.IIn order to determine the remedies for\nunseaworthiness, we must consider both the heritage of the cause of\naction in the common law and its place in the modern statutory\nframework.AThe seaman\u2019s right to recover damages for\npersonal injury on a claim of unseaworthiness originates in the\nadmiralty court decisions of the 19th century. At the time, \u201cseamen\nled miserable lives.\u201d D. Robertson, S. Friedell, & M. Sturley,\nAdmiralty and Maritime Law in the United States 163 (2d ed. 2008).\nMaritime law was largely judge-made, and seamen were viewed as\n\u201cemphatically the wards of the admiralty.\u201dHardenv.Gordon, 11 F. Cas. 480, 485 (No. 6,047) (CC Me. 1823). In\nthat era, the primary responsibility for protecting seamen lay in\nthe courts, which saw mariners as \u201cpeculiarly entitled to\u201d\u2014and\nparticularly in need of\u2014judicial protection \u201cagainst the effects of\nthe superior skill and shrewdness of masters and owners of ships.\u201dBrownv.Lull, 4 F. Cas. 407, 409 (No. 2,018) (CC\nMass. 1836) (Story, J.).[1]Courts of admiralty saw it as their duty not to\nbe \u201cconfined to the mere dry and positive rules of the common law\u201d\nbut to \u201cact upon the enlarged and liberal jurisprudence of courts\nof equity; and, in short, so far as their powers extend[ed], they\nact[ed] as courts of equity.\u201dIbid.This Court interpreted\nthe Constitution\u2019s grant of admiralty jurisdiction to the Federal\nJudiciary as \u201cthe power to .\u00a0.\u00a0. dispose of [a case] as\njustice may require.\u201dThe Resolute,168\nU.S. 437, 439 (1897).Courts used this power to protect seamen from\ninjury primarily through two causes of action. The first,\nmaintenance and cure, has its roots in the medieval and renaissance\nlaw codes that form the ancient foundation of maritime common\nlaw.[2] The duty of maintenance\nand cure requires a ship\u2019s master \u201cto provide food, lodging, and\nmedical services to a seaman injured while serving the ship.\u201dLewisv.Lewis & Clark Marine,Inc.,531 U.S.\n438, 441 (2001). This duty, \u201cwhich arises from the contract of\nemployment, does not rest upon negligence or culpability on the\npart of the owner or master, nor is it restricted to those cases\nwhere the seaman\u2019s employment is the cause of the injury or\nillness.\u201dCalmar S. S. Corp.v.Taylor,303 U.S.\n525, 527 (1938) (citations omitted).The second claim, unseaworthiness, is a much\nmore recent development and grew out of causes of action unrelated\nto personal injury. In its earliest forms, an unseaworthiness claim\ngave sailors under contract to sail on a ship the right to collect\ntheir wages even if they had refused to board an unsafe vessel\nafter discovering its condition. See,e.g., Dixonv.The\nCyrus, 7 F. Cas. 755, 757 (No. 3,930) (Pa. 1789);Ricev.The Polly & Kitty, 20 F. Cas. 666, 667 (No. 11,754)\n(Pa. 1789). Similarly, unseaworthiness was a defense to criminal\ncharges against seamen who refused to obey a ship master\u2019s orders.\nSee,e.g.,United Statesv.Nye, 27 F. Cas.\n210, 211 (No. 15,906) (CC Mass. 1855);United Statesv.Ashton, 24 F. Cas. 873, 874\u2013875 (No. 14,470) (CC Mass.\n1834). A claim of unseaworthiness could also be asserted by a\nshipper to recover damages or by an insurer to deny coverage when\nthe poor condition of the ship resulted in damage to or loss of the\ncargo. SeeThe Caledonia,157 U.S.\n124, 132\u2013136 (1895) (cataloging cases).Only in the latter years of the 19th century did\nunseaworthiness begin a long and gradual evolution toward remedying\npersonal injury. Courts began to extend the cases about refusals to\nserve to allow recovery for mariners who were injured because of\nthe unseaworthy condition of the vessel on which they had\nserved.[3] These early cases\nwere sparse, and they generally allowed recovery only when a\nvessel\u2019s owner failed to exercise due diligence to ensure that the\nship left port in a seaworthy condition. See,e.g.,The\nRobert C. McQuillen, 91 F. 685, 686\u2013687 (Conn. 1899);The\nLizzie Frank, 31 F. 477, 480 (SD Ala. 1887);The\nTammerlane, 47 F. 822, 824 (ND Cal. 1891).Unseaworthiness remained a suspect basis for\npersonal injury claims until 1903, when, in dicta, this Court\nconcluded that \u201cthe vessel and her owner are .\u00a0.\u00a0. liable\nto an indemnity for injuries received by seamen in consequence of\nthe unseaworthiness of the ship.\u201dThe Osceola,189 U.S.\n158, 175 (1903). Although this was the first recognition of\nunseaworthiness as a personal injury claim in this Court, we took\npains to note that the claim was strictly cabined.Ibid.\nSome of the limitations on recovery were imported from the common\nlaw. The fellow-servant doctrine, in particular, prohibited\nrecovery when an employee suffered an injury due to the negligent\nact of another employee without negligence on the part of the\nemployer.Ibid.; see,e.g.,The Sachem, 42 F.\n66 (EDNY 1890) (denying recovery based on fellow-servant doctrine).\nBecause a claimant had to show that he was injured by some aspect\nof the ship\u2019s condition that rendered the vessel unseaworthy, a\nclaim could not prevail based on \u201cthe negligence of the master, or\nany member of the crew.\u201d\u00a0[4]The Osceola,supra, at 175; see alsoThe City of Alexandria, 17 F. 390 (SDNY 1883) (no recovery\nbased on negligence that does not render vessel unseaworthy).\nInstead, a seaman had to show that the owner of the vessel had\nfailed to exercise due diligence in ensuring the ship was in\nseaworthy condition. See generallyDixonv.United\nStates, 219 F.2d 10, 12\u201314 (CA2 1955) (Harlan, J.) (cataloging\nevolution of the claim).BIn the early 20th century, then, under \u201cthe\ngeneral maritime law .\u00a0.\u00a0. a vessel and her owner\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. were liable to an indemnity for injuries received\nby a seaman in consequence of the unseaworthiness of the ship and\nher appliances; but a seaman was not allowed to recover an\nindemnity for injuries sustained through the negligence of the\nmaster or any member of the crew.\u201dPacific S. S. Co.v.Peterson,278 U.S.\n130, 134 (1928); see alsoPlamalsv.S.S. \u201cPinar Del Rio,\u201d277 U.S.\n151, 155 (1928) (vessel was not unseaworthy when mate\nnegligently selected defective rope but sound rope was available on\nboard). Because of these severe limitations on recovery, \u201cthe\nseaman\u2019s right to recover damages for injuries caused by\nunseaworthiness of the ship was an obscure and relatively little\nused rem- edy.\u201d G. Gilmore & C. Black, The Law of Admiralty\n\u00a76\u201338, p.\u00a0383 (2d ed. 1975) (Gilmore & Black).Tremendous shifts in mariners\u2019 rights took place\nbetween 1920 and 1950. First, during and after the First World War,\nCongress enacted a series of laws regulating maritime liability\nculminating in the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, \u00a733, 41Stat. 1007\n(Jones Act), which codified the rights of injured mariners and\ncreated new statutory claims that were freed from many of the\ncommon-law limitations on recovery. The Jones Act provides injured\nseamen with a cause of action and a right to a jury. 46\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a730104. Rather than create a new structure of\nsubstantive rights, the Jones Act incorporated the rights provided\nto railway workers under the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act\n(FELA), 45 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a751et seq. 46\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a730104. In the 30 years after the Jones Act\u2019s\npassage, \u201cthe Act was the vehicle for almost all seamen\u2019s personal\ninjury and death actions.\u201d Gilmore & Black \u00a76\u201320, at 327.But the Jones Act was overtaken in the 1950s by\nthe second fundamental change in personal injury maritime\nclaims\u2014and it was this Court, not Congress, that played the leading\nrole. In a pair of decisions in the late 1940s, the Court\ntransformed the old claim of unseaworthiness, which had demanded\nonly due diligence by the vessel owner, into a strict-liability\nclaim. InMahnichv.Southern S.\u00a0S. Co.,321 U.S.\n96(1944), the Court stated that \u201cthe exercise of due diligence\ndoes not relieve the owner of his obligation\u201d to provide a\nseaworthy ship and, in the same ruling, held that the\nfellow-servant doctrine did not provide a defense.Id., at\n100, 101.Mahnich\u2019s interpretation of the early cases may\nhave been suspect, see Tetreault 397\u2013398 (Mahnichrests on\n\u201cstartling misstatement\u201d of relevant precedents), but its assertion\ntriggered a sea-change in maritime personal injury. Less than two\nyears later, we affirmed that the duty of seaworthiness was\n\u201cessentially a species of liability without fault .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nneither limited by conceptions of negligence nor contractual in\ncharacter. It is a form of absolute duty owing to all within the\nrange of its humanitarian policy.\u201dSeas Shipping Co.v.Sieracki,328 U.S.\n85, 94\u201395 (1946) (citations omitted). FromMahnichforward, \u201cthe decisions of this Court have undeviatingly reflected\nan understanding that the owner\u2019s duty to furnish a seaworthy ship\nis absolute and completely independent of his duty under the Jones\nAct to exercise reasonable care.\u201dMitchellv.Trawler\nRacer,Inc.,362 U.S.\n539, 549 (1960). As a result ofMahnichandSieracki, between the 1950s and 1970s \u201cthe unseaworthiness\ncount [was] the essential basis for recovery with the Jones Act\ncount preserved merely as a jury-getting device.\u201d[5] Gilmore & Black \u00a76\u201320, at 327\u2013328.The shifts in plaintiff preferences between\nJones Act and unseaworthiness claims were possible because of the\nsignificant overlap between the two causes of action. Seeid., \u00a76\u201338, at 383. One leading treatise goes so far as to\ndescribe the two claims as \u201calternative \u2018grounds\u2019 of recovery for a\nsingle cause of action.\u201d 2 R. Force & M. Norris, The Law of\nSeamen \u00a730:90, p.\u00a030\u2013369 (5th ed. 2003). The two claims are so\nsimilar that, immediately after the Jones Act\u2019s passage, we held\nthat plaintiffs could not submit both to a jury.Plamals,supra, at 156\u2013157 (\u201cSeamen may invoke, at their election,\nthe relief accorded by the old rules against the ship, or that\nprovided by the new against the employer. But they may not have the\nbenefit of both\u201d). We no longer require such election. SeeMcAllisterv.Magnolia Petroleum Co.,357 U.S.\n221, 222, n.\u00a02 (1958). But a plaintiff still cannot\nduplicate his recovery by collecting full damages on both claims\nbecause, \u201cwhether or not the seaman\u2019s injuries were occasioned by\nthe unseaworthiness of the vessel or by the negligence of the\nmaster or members of the crew,\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. there is but a\nsingle wrongful invasion of his primary right of bodily safety and\nbut a single legal wrong.\u201dPeterson, 278 U.\u00a0S., at 138;\nsee also 2 Force,supra, \u00a7\u00a726:73, 30:90.IIChristopher Batterton worked as a deckhand and\ncrew member on vessels owned and operated by the Dutra Group.\nAccording to Batterton\u2019s complaint, while working on a scow near\nNewport Beach, California, Batterton was injured when his hand was\ncaught between a bulkhead and a hatch that blew open as a result of\nunventilated air accumulating and pressurizing within the\ncompartment.Batterton sued Dutra and asserted a variety of\nclaims, including negligence, unseaworthiness, maintenance and\ncure, and unearned wages. He sought to recover general and punitive\ndamages. Dutra moved to strike Batterton\u2019s claim for punitive\ndamages, arguing that they are not available on claims for\nunseaworthiness. The District Court denied Dutra\u2019s motion, 2014 WL\n12538172 (CD Cal., Dec. 15, 2014), but agreed to certify an\ninterlocutory appeal on the question, 2015 WL 13752889 (CD Cal.,\nFeb. 6, 2015).The Court of Appeals affirmed. 880 F.3d 1089\n(CA9 2018). Applying Circuit precedent, seeEvichv.Morris, 819 F.2d 256, 258\u2013259 (CA9 1987), the Court of\nAppeals held that punitive damages are available for\nunseaworthiness claims. 880 F.\u00a03d, at 1096. This holding\nreaffirmed a division of authority between the Circuits. CompareMcBridev.Estis Well Serv.,L. L. C., 768\nF.3d 382, 391 (CA5 2014) (en banc) (punitive damages are not\nrecover- able), andHorsleyv.Mobil Oil Corp.,15 F.3d 200,203(CA1 1994) (same), withSelfv.Great Lakes\nDredge & Dock Co., 832 F.2d 1540, 1550 (CA11 1987)\n(\u201cPunitive damages should be available in cases where the shipowner\nwillfully violated the duty to maintain a safe and seaworthy ship\n.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d). We granted certiorari to resolve this division.\n586 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2018).IIIOur resolution of this question is governed by\nour decisions inMilesandAtlantic Sounding.Milesestablishes that we \u201cshould look primarily to\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. legislative enactments for policy guidance,\u201d while\nrecognizing that we \u201cmay supplement these statutory remedies where\ndoing so would achieve the uniform vindication\u201d of the policies\nserved by the relevant statutes. 498 U.\u00a0S., at 27. InAtlanticSounding, we allowed recovery of punitive\ndamages, but we justified our departure from the statutory remedial\nscheme based on the established history of awarding punitive\ndamages for certain maritime torts, including maintenance and cure.\n557 U.\u00a0S., at 411\u2013414 (discussing cases of piracy and\nmaintenance and cure awarding damages with punitive components). We\nwere explicit that our decision represented a gloss onMilesrather than a departure from it.Atlantic Sounding,supra, at 420 (\u201cThe reasoning ofMilesremains\nsound\u201d). And we recognized the importance of viewing each claim in\nits proper historical context. \u201c\u00a0\u2018[R]emedies for negligence,\nunseaworthiness, and maintenance and cure have different origins\nand may on occasion call for application of slightly different\nprinciples and procedures.\u2019\u00a0\u201d 557 U.\u00a0S., at 423.In accordance with these decisions, we consider\nhere whether punitive damages have traditionally been awarded for\nclaims of unseaworthiness and whether conformity with parallel\nstatutory schemes would require such damages. Finally, we consider\nwhether we are compelled on policy grounds to allow punitive\ndamages for unseaworthiness claims.AFor claims of unseaworthiness, the\noverwhelming historical evidence suggests that punitive damages are\nnot available. Batterton principally relies on two cases to\nestablish that punitive damages were traditionally avail- able for\nbreach of the duty of seaworthiness. Upon close inspection, neither\nsupports this argument.The Rolph, 293 F. 269, 271 (ND Cal.\n1923), involved a mate who brutally beat members of the crew,\nrendering one seaman blind and leaving another with impaired\nhearing. The central question in the case was not the form of\ndamages, but rather whether the viciousness of the mate rendered\nthe vessel unseaworthy.The Rolph, 299 F. 52, 54 (CA9 1924).\nThe court concluded that the master, by staffing the vessel with\nsuch an unsuitable officer, had rendered it unseaworthy.Id., at 55. To the extent the court described the basis for\nthe damages awarded, it explained that the judgment was supported\nby testimony as to \u201cthe expectation of life and earnings of these\nmen.\u201d 293 F., at 272. And the Court of Appeals discussed only the\nseamen\u2019s entitlement \u201cto recover an indemnity\u201d for their injuries.\n299 F., at 56. These are discussions of compensatory\ndamages\u2014nowhere does the court speak in terms of an exemplary or\npunitive award.[6]The Noddleburn,28 F. 855, 857\u2013858 (Ore.\n1886), involved an injury to a British seaman serving on a British\nvessel and was decided under English law. The plaintiff in the case\nwas injured when he fell to the deck after being ordered aloft and\nstepping on an inadequately secured line.Id., at 855. After\nthe injury, the master neglected the man\u2019s wounds, thinking the\ninjury a mere sprain.Id., at 856. The leg failed to heal\nand the man had to insist on being discharged to a hospital, where\nhe learned that he would be permanently disabled.Ibid.As\ndamages, the court awarded him accrued wages, as well as $1,000 to\ncompensate for the loss in future earnings from his dis- ability\nand $500 for his pain and suffering.Id., at 860. But these\nare purely compensatory awards\u2014the only discussion of exemplary\ndamages comes at the very close of the opinion, and it is clear\nthat they were considered because of the master\u2019s failure to\nprovide maintenance and cure.Ibid.(discussing additional\naward \u201cin consideration of the neglect and indifference with which\nthe libelant was treated by the masterafter his injury\u201d\n(emphasis added)).Finally, Batterton points to two other cases,The City of Carlisle, 39 F. 807 (Ore. 1889), andThe\nTroop, 118 F. 769 (Wash. 1902). But these cases, likeTheNoddleburn, both involve maintenance and cure\nclaims that rest on the willful failure of the master and mate to\nprovide proper care for wounded sailors after they were injured. 39\nF., at 812 (\u201cmaster failed and neglected to procure or provide any\nmedical aid or advice .\u00a0.\u00a0. and was contriving and\nintending to get rid of him as easily as possible\u201d); 118 F., at 771\n(assessing damages based on provision of Laws of Oleron requiring\nmaintenance). Batterton characterizes these as unseaworthiness\nactions on the theory that the seamencould havepursued\nthat claim. But, because courts award damages for the claims a\nplaintiff actually pleads rather than those he could have brought,\nthese cases are irrelevant.The lack of punitive damages in traditional\nmaritime law cases is practically dispositive. By the time the\nclaim of unseaworthiness evolved to remedy personal injury,\npunitive damages were a well-established part of the common law.Exxon Shipping, 554 U.\u00a0S., at 491. American courts had\nawarded punitive (or exemplary) damages from the Republic\u2019s\nearliest days. See,e.g.,Genayv.Norris, 1\nS.\u00a0C. L. 6, 7 (1784);Coryellv.Colbaugh, 1\nN.\u00a0J.\u00a0L. 77, 78 (1791). And yet, beyond the decisions\ndiscussed above, Batterton presents no decisions from the formative\nyears of the personal injury unseaworthiness claim in which\nexemplary damages were awarded. From this we conclude that, unlike\nmaintenance and cure, unseawor- thiness did not traditionally allow\nrecovery of punitive damages.BIn light of this overwhelming historical\nevidence, we cannot sanction a novel remedy here unless it is\nrequired to maintain uniformity with Congress\u2019s clearly expressed\npolicies. Therefore, we must consider the remedies typically\nrecognized for Jones Act claims.The Jones Act adopts the remedial provisions of\nFELA, and by the time of the Jones Act\u2019s passage, this Court and\nothers had repeatedly interpreted the scope of damages available to\nFELA plaintiffs. These early decisions held that \u201c[t]he damages\nrecoverable [under FELA] are limited . . . strictly to the\nfinancial loss .\u00a0.\u00a0. sustained.\u201d[7]American R. Co. of P. R.v.Didricksen,227 U.S.\n145, 149 (1913); see alsoGulf,C. & S. F. R.\nCo.v.McGinnis,228 U.S.\n173, 175 (1913) (FELA is construed \u201conly to compensate\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. for the actual pecuniary loss resulting\u201d from the\nworker\u2019s injury or death);Michigan Central R. Co.v.Vreeland,227 U.S.\n59, 68 (1913) (FELA imposes \u201ca liability for the pecuniary\ndamage resulting to [the worker] and for that only\u201d). In one\nparticularly illuminating case, in deciding whether a complaint\nalleged a claim under FELA or state law, the Court observed that if\nthe complaint \u201cwere read as manifestly demanding exemplary damages,\nthat would point to the state law.\u201dSeaboard Air Line R. Co.v.Koennecke,239 U.S.\n352, 354 (1915). And in the years since, Federal Courts of\nAppeals have unanimously held that punitive damages are not\navailable under FELA.Millerv.American President\nLines,Ltd., 989 F.2d 1450, 1457 (CA6 1993);Wildmanv.Burlington No. R.\u00a0Co., 825 F.2d 1392,\n1395 (CA9 1987);Kozarv.Chesapeake & Ohio R.\nCo., 449 F.2d 1238, 1243 (CA6 1971).Our early discussions of the Jones Act followed\nthe same practices. We described the Act shortly after its passage\nas creating \u201can action for compensatory damages, on the ground of\nnegligence.\u201d[8]Peterson, 278 U.\u00a0S., at 135. And we have more recently\nobserved that the Jones Act \u201climits recovery to pecuniary loss.\u201dMiles, 498 U.\u00a0S., at 32. Looking to FELA and these\ndecisions, the Federal Courts of Appeals have uniformly held that\npunitive damages are not available under the Jones Act.McBride, 768 F.\u00a03d, at 388 (\u201c[N]o cases have awarded\npunitive damages under the Jones Act\u201d);Guevarav.Maritime Overseas Corp.,59 F.3d 1496, 1507, n.\u00a09 (CA5 1995) (en banc);Horsley, 15 F.\u00a03d, at 203;Miller,supra,\nat 1457 (\u201cPunitive damages are not .\u00a0.\u00a0. recoverable\nunder the Jones Act\u201d);Kopczynskiv.The Jacqueline,\n742 F.2d 555, 560 (CA9 1984).Batterton argues that these cases are either\ninapposite or wrong, but because of the absence of historical\nevidence to support punitive damages\u2014evidence that was central to\nour decision inAtlantic Sounding\u2014we need not reopen this\nquestion of statutory interpretation. It is enough for us to note\nthe general consensus that exists in the lower courts and to\nobserve that the position of those courts conforms with the\ndiscussion and holding inMiles. Adopting the rule urged by\nBatterton would be contrary toMiles\u2019s command that federal\ncourts should seek to promote a \u201cuniform rule applicable to all\nactions\u201d for the same injury, whether under the Jones Act or the\ngeneral maritime law. 498 U.\u00a0S., at 33.CTo the extent Batterton argues that punitive\ndamages are justified on policy grounds or as a regulatory measure,\nwe are unpersuaded. In contemporary maritime law, our overriding\nobjective is to pursue the policy expressed in congressional\nenactments, and because unseaworthiness in its current\nstrict-liability form is our own invention and came after passage\nof the Jones Act, it would exceed our current role to introduce\nnovel remedies contradictory to those Congress has provided in\nsimilar areas. Seeid., at 36 (declining to create remedy\n\u201cthat goes well beyond the limits of Congress\u2019 ordered system of\nrecovery\u201d). We are particularly loath to impose more expansive\nliabilities on a claim governed by strict liability than Congress\nhas imposed for comparable claims based in negligence.Ibid.And with the increased role that legislation has taken over the\npast century of maritime law, we think it wise to leave to the\npolitical branches the development of novel claims and\nremedies.We are also wary to depart from the practice\nunder the Jones Act because a claim of unseaworthiness\u2014more than a\nclaim for maintenance and cure\u2014serves as a duplicate and substitute\nfor a Jones Act claim. The duty of maintenance and cure requires\nthe master to provide medical care and wages to an injured mariner\nin the period after the injury has occurred.Calmar S. S.\nCorp., 303 U.\u00a0S., at 527\u2013528. By contrast, both the Jones\nAct and unseaworthiness claims compensate for the injury itself and\nfor the losses resulting from the injury.Peterson,supra, at 138. In such circumstances, we are particularly\nmindful of the rule that requires us to promote uniformity between\nmaritime statutory law and maritime common law.[9] SeeMiles,supra, at 27. See alsoMobil Oil Corp.v.Higginbotham,436 U.S.\n618, 625 (1978) (declining to recognize loss-of-society damages\nunder general maritime law because that would \u201crewrit[e the] rules\nthat Congress has affirmatively and specifically enacted\u201d).Unlike a claim of maintenance and cure, which\naddresses a situation where the vessel owner and master have \u201cjust\nabout every economic incentive to dump an injured seaman in a port\nand abandon him to his fate,\u201d in the unseaworthiness context the\ninterests of the owner and mariner are more closely aligned.McBride,supra, at 394, n.\u00a012 (Clement, J.,\nconcurring). That is because there are significant economic\nincentives prompting owners to ensure that their vessels are\nseaworthy. Most obviously, an owner who puts an unseaworthy ship to\nsea stands to lose the ship and the cargo that it carries. And if a\nvessel\u2019s unseaworthiness threatens the crew or cargo, the owner\nrisks losing the protection of his insurer (who may not cover\nlosses incurred by the owner\u2019s negligence) and the work of the crew\n(who may refuse to serve on an unseaworthy vessel). In some\ninstances, the vessel owner may even face criminal penalties. See,e.g., 46 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a710908.Allowing punitive damages on unseaworthiness\nclaims would also create bizarre disparities in the law. First, due\nto our holding inMiles, which limited recovery to\ncompensatory damages in wrongful-death actions, a mariner could\nmake a claim for punitive damages if he was injured onboard a ship,\nbut his estate would lose the right to seek punitive damages if he\ndied from his injuries. Second, because unseaworthiness claims run\nagainst the owner of the vessel, the ship\u2019s owner could be liable\nfor punitive damages while the master or operator of the ship\u2014who\nhas more control over onboard conditions and is best positioned to\nminimize potential risks\u2014would not be liable for such damages under\nthe Jones Act. SeeSieracki, 328 U.\u00a0S., at 100 (The\nduty of seaworthiness is \u201cpeculiarly and exclusively the obligation\nof the owner. It is one he cannot delegate\u201d).Finally, because \u201c[n]oncompensatory damages are\nnot part of the civil-code tradition and thus unavailable in such\ncountries,\u201dExxon Shipping, 554 U.\u00a0S., at 497, allowing\npunitive damages would place American shippers at a significant\ncompetitive disadvantage and would discourage foreign-owned vessels\nfrom employing American seamen. See Gotanda, Punitive Damages: A\nComparative Analysis, 42 Colum. J. Transnat\u2019l L. 391, 396,\nn.\u00a024 (2004) (listing civil-law nations that restrict private\nplaintiffs to compensatory damages). This would frustrate another\n\u201cfundamental interest\u201d served by federal maritime jurisdiction:\n\u201cthe protection of maritime commerce.\u201dNorfolk Southern R.\nCo.v.James N. Kirby,Pty Ltd.,543 U.S.\n14, 25 (2004) (internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis\ndeleted).Against this, Batterton points to the maritime\ndoctrine that encourages special solicitude for the welfare of\nseamen. But that doctrine has its roots in the paternalistic\napproach taken toward mariners by 19th century courts. See,e.g.,Harden, 11 F.\u00a0Cas., at 485;Brown,\n4 F.\u00a0Cas., at 409. The doctrine has never been a commandment\nthat maritime law must favor seamen whenever possible. Indeed, the\ndoctrine\u2019s apex coincided with many of the harsh common-law\nlimitations on recovery that were not set aside until the passage\nof the Jones Act. And, while sailors today face hardships not\nencountered by those who work on land, neither are they as isolated\nnor as dependent on the master as their predecessors from the age\nof sail. In light of these changes and of the roles now played by\nthe Judiciary and the political branches in protecting sailors, the\nspecial solicitude to sailors has only a small role to play in\ncontemporary maritime law. It is not sufficient to overcome the\nweight of authority indicating that punitive damages are\nunavailable.IVPunitive damages are not a traditional remedy\nfor unseaworthiness. The rule ofMiles\u2014promoting uniformity\nin maritime law and deference to the policies expressed in the\nstatutes governing maritime law\u2014prevents us from recognizing a new\nentitlement to punitive damages where none previously existed. We\nhold that a plaintiff may not recover punitive damages on a claim\nof unseaworthiness.We reverse the judgment of the United States\nCourt of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and remand the case for\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.Notes1Riding circuit, Justice\nStory described mariners in markedly paternalistic terms: \u201cSeamen\nare a class of persons remarkable for their rashness,\nthoughtlessness and improvidence. They are generally necessitous,\nignorant of the nature and extent of their own rights and\nprivileges, and for the most part incapable of duly appreciating\ntheir value. They combine, in a singular manner, the apparent\nanomalies of gallantry, extravagance, profusion in expenditure,\nindifference to the future, credulity, which is easily won, and\nconfidence, which is readily surprised.\u201d Brown, 4 F. Cas., at\n409.2A right resembling\nmaintenance and cure appears in the Laws of Oleron, promulgated by\nEleanor of Aquitaine around 1160, in the 13th-century Laws of\nWisbuy, in the Laws of the Hanse Towns, published in 1597, and in\nthe Marine Ordinances of Louis XIV, published in 1681. See 30 F.\nCas. 1169 (collecting sources). The relevant passages are the Laws\nof Oleron, Arts.\u00a0VI and VII, 30 F. Cas., at 1174\u20131175; the\nLaws of Wisbuy, Arts. XVIII, XIX, and XXXIII, 30 F. Cas., at\n1191\u20131192; the Laws of the Hanse Towns, Arts. XXXIX and XLV, 30 F.\nCas., at 1200; the Marine Ordinances of Louis XIV, Tit. IV, Arts.\nXI and XII, 30 F. Cas., at 1209.3Most of these cases\nallowed recovery for personal injury in \u201cerroneous reliance\u201d on\ncertain passages inDixonv.The Cyrus, 7 F. Cas. 755\n(No. 3,930) (Pa. 1789). Tetreault, Seamen, Seaworthiness, and the\nRights of Harbor Workers, 39 Cornell L.\u00a0Q. 381, 390 (1954)\n(Tetreault). These cases misreadThe Cyrusas resting on an\nimplied warranty of seaworthiness. Tetreault 390.ButThe\nCyrusis more fairly read to turn on a theory of true implied\ncondition. While a warranty would provide a basis for damages if\nthe breach caused an injury, an implied condition would only allow\nthe mariner to escape performance without surrendering the benefit\nof the contract. In other words, \u201c[t]he manifest unseaworthiness of\nthe vessel at the commencement of the voyage would excuse\nnon-performance by the mariners but did not constitute a basis for\ndamages.\u201d Tetreault 390.4To be sure, in some\ninstances the concept of \u201cunseaworthiness\u201d expanded to embrace\nconditions that resulted from the negligence of fellow servants,\nsee,e.g.,Carlisle Packing Co.v.Sandanger,259 U.S.\n255, 259 (1922) (vessel was rendered unseaworthy when it left\nport with gasoline in a container labeled \u201ccoal oil\u201d); see also G.\nRobinson, Handbook of Admiralty Law in the United States \u00a737,\np.\u00a0305\u2013307 (1st ed. 1939) (collecting cases). But it was only\nafter the passage of the Jones Act that negligence by a fellow\nmariner provided a reliable basis for recovery. See Part I\u2013B,infra.5The decline of Jones Act\nclaims was arrested, although not reversed, by our holding that\nsome negligent actions on a vessel may create Jones Act liability\nwithout rendering the vessel unseaworthy. SeeUsnerv.Luckenbach Overseas Corp.,400 U.S.\n494(1971); see also 1B Benedict on Admiralty \u00a723, p.\u00a03\u201335\n(7th rev. ed. 2018).6Even if this case did\ninvolve asub silentiopunitive award, we share the Fifth\nCircuit\u2019s reluctance to \u201crely on one dust-covered case to establish\nthat punitive damages were generally available in unseaworthiness\ncases.\u201dMcBridev.Estis Well Serv., L. L. C., 768\nF.3d 382, 397 (2014) (Clement, J., concurring). Absent a clear\nhistorical pattern,Milesv.Apex Marine Corp.,498 U.S.\n19(1990), commands us to seek conformity with the policy\npreferences the political branches have expressed in\nlegislation.7Treatises from the same\nperiod lend further support to the view that \u201cin all actions under\n[FELA], an award of exemplary damages is not permitted.\u201d 2 M.\nRoberts, Federal Liabilities of Carriers \u00a7621, p.\u00a01093 (1918);\n1id., \u00a7417, at 708; 5 J. Berryman, Sutherland on Damages\n\u00a71333, p.\u00a05102 (4th ed. 1916) (FELA \u201cprovid[es] compensation\nfor pecuniary loss or damage only\u201d).8We also note that\nCongress declined to allow punitive damages when it enacted the\nDeath on the High Seas Act. 46 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a730303 (allowing\n\u201cfair compensation for the pecuniary loss sustained\u201d for a death on\nthe high seas).9The dissent,postat 9, and n.\u00a07 (opinion of Ginsburg, J.), suggests that\nbecause of the existing differences between a Jones Act claim and\nan unseaworthiness claim, recognizing punitive damages would not be\na cause of disparity. But, as the dissent acknowledges, much of the\nexpanded reach of the modern unseaworthiness doctrine can be\nattributed to innovations made by this Court following the\nenactment of the Jones Act. Seepostat 8, and n.\u00a06;supra, at 7\u20138. Although Batterton and the dissent would\ncontinue this evolution by recognizing damages previously\nunavailable,Milesdictates that such innovation is the\nprerogative of the political branches, our past expansion of the\nunseaworthiness doctrine notwithstanding. Of course,Milesrecognized that the general maritime law need not be static. For\nexample, our decision inMoragnev.States Marine Lines,\nInc.,398 U.S.\n375(1970), smoothed a disjunction created by the imperfect\nalignment of statutory claims with past decisions limiting maritime\nclaims for wrongful death. But when there is no disjunction\u2014as\nhere, where traditional remedies align with modern statutory\nremedies\u2014we are unwilling to endorse doctrinal changes absent\nlegislative changes.",
