FELKNERv.STEVEN FRANK JACKSONon petition for writ of certiorari to the united\nstates court of appeals for the ninth circuitNo. 10\u2013797.\u2003Decided March 21, 2011Per Curiam.A California jury convicted\nrespondent Steven Frank Jackson of numerous sexual offenses\nstemming from his attack on a 72-year-old woman who lived in his\napartment complex. Jackson raised aBatsonclaim,\nasserting that the prosecutor exercised peremptory challenges to\nexclude black prospective jurors on the basis of their race. SeeBatsonv.Kentucky,476 U. S. 79(1986). Two\nof three black jurors had been struck; the third served on the\njury. App. to Pet. for Cert. 49\u201350.Jackson\u2019s counsel did not object when the\nprosecutor struck the first of the black jurors, Juror S. Counsel\nlater explained that he did not make a \u201cmotion at that time\u201d\nbecause he thought the excusal of Juror S \u201cwas a close call.\u201d After\nthe prosecutor sought to dismiss the second juror, Juror J,\nJackson\u2019s counsel made theBatsonmotion challenging both\nstrikes. Record in No. 2:07-cv-00555-RJB (ED Cal.), Doc. 29, Lodged\nDoc. No. 7, pp. 76\u201377 (hereinafter Document 7).The prosecutor offered a race-neutral\nexplanation for striking each juror: Juror S had stated that from\nthe ages of 16 to 30 years old, he was frequently stopped by\nCalifornia police officers because\u2014in his view\u2014of his race and age.\nAs the prosecutor put it, \u201cWhether or not he still harbors any\nanimosity is not something I wanted to roll the dice with.\u201dId., at 78; Record in No. 2:07-cv-00555-RJB (ED Cal.),\nDoc. 29, Lodged Doc. No. 10, pp. 57\u201358, 98\u2013100 (hereinafter\nDocument 10).The prosecutor stated that he struck Juror J\nbecause she had a master\u2019s degree in social work, and had interned\nat the county jail, \u201cprobably in the psych unit as a sociologist of\nsome sort.\u201d The prosecutor explained that he dismissed her \u201cbased\non her educational background,\u201d stating that he does not \u201clike to\nkeep social workers.\u201d Document 7, at 78\u201379; Document 10, at\n188\u2013189; App. to Pet. for Cert. 49.Jackson\u2019s counsel expressly disagreed only\nwith the prosecutor\u2019s explanation for the strike of Juror J, see\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 22\u201323, 47, arguing that removing her on the\nbasis of her educational background was \u201citself invidious\ndiscrimination.\u201d The prosecutor responded that he was not aware\nthat social workers were a \u201cprotected class.\u201d As for Juror S,\nJackson\u2019s counsel explained that he \u201clet [Juror S] slide\u201d because\nhe anticipated the prosecutor\u2019s response and, in any event, he\n\u201conly need[ed] one to establish the grounds for\u201d aBatsonmotion. After listening to each side\u2019s arguments, the trial court\ndenied Jackson\u2019s motion. Document 7, at 78\u201380.Jackson renewed hisBatsonclaim on\ndirect appeal, arguing that a comparative juror analysis revealed\nthat the prosecutor\u2019s explanations were pretextual. With respect to\nJuror S, Jackson argued that a non-black juror\u2014Juror 8\u2014also had\nnegative experiences with law enforcement but remained on the jury.\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 47\u201348. Juror 8 stated during jury selection\nthat he had been stopped while driving in Illinois several years\nearlier as part of what he believed to be a \u201cscam\u201d by Illinois\npolice targeting drivers with California license plates. Juror 8\nalso complained that he had been disappointed by the failure of law\nenforcement officers to investigate the burglary of his car.\nDocument 10, at 26\u201327, 56\u201357, 95\u201397.With respect to Juror J, Jackson claimed that\nthe prosecutor asked follow-up questions of several white jurors\nwhen he was concerned about their educational backgrounds, but\nstruck Juror J without asking her any questions about her degree in\nsocial work. App. to Pet. for Cert. 49.The California Court of Appeal upheld the\ntrial court\u2019s denial of theBatsonmotion and affirmed\nJackson\u2019s convictions. The appellate court explained that \u201c[t]he\ntrial court\u2019s ruling on this issue is reviewed for substantial\nevidence,\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 43 (internal quotation marks\nomitted), which the California courts have characterized as\nequivalent to the \u201cclear error\u201d standard employed by federal\ncourts, see,e.g.,Peoplev.Alvarez, 14\nCal. 4th 155, 196, 926 P.\u00a02d 365, 389 (1996). With respect to\nwhether the prosecutor\u2019s stated reasons were pretextual, the court\nexplained that it \u201cgive[s] great deference to the trial court\u2019s\nability to distinguish bona fide reasons from sham excuses.\u201d App.\nto Pet. for Cert. 43.After comparing Juror S to Juror 8, the court\nconcluded that \u201cJuror 8\u2019s negative experience out of state and the\ncar burglary is not comparable to [Juror S\u2019s] 14 years of perceived\nharassment by law enforcement based in part on race.\u201dId.,\nat 48. As for Juror J, the court recognized that the prosecutor\u2019s\ndismissal was based on her social services background\u2014\u201ca proper\nrace-neutral reason\u201d\u2014and that this explained his different\ntreatment of jurors with \u201cbackgrounds in law, bio-chemistry or\nenvironmental engineering.\u201d The court also noted that the\n\u201cprosecutor focused on [Juror J\u2019s] internship experience\u201d at the\ncounty jail.Id., at 49.After the California Supreme Court denied\nJackson\u2019s petition for review, Jackson sought federal habeas\nrelief. The Federal District Court properly recognized that review\nof Jackson\u2019s claim was governed by the Antiterrorism and Effective\nDeath Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA). That law provides, in pertinent\npart, that federal habeas relief may not be granted unless the\nstate court adjudication \u201cresulted in a decision that was based on\nan unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence\npresented in the State court proceeding.\u201d 28 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a72254(d)(2). After considering the state Court of Appeal decision\nand reviewing the record evidence, the District Court held that the\nCalifornia Court of Appeal\u2019s findings were not unreasonable. App.\nto Pet. for Cert. 24. The District Court therefore denied Jackson\u2019s\npetition.The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit\nreversed in a three-paragraph unpublished memorandum opinion. 389\nFed. Appx. 640 (2010). In so doing, the court did not discuss any\nspecific facts or mention the reasoning of the other three courts\nthat had rejected Jackson\u2019s claim. Instead, after setting forth the\nbasic background legal principles in the first two paragraphs, the\nCourt of Appeals offered a one-sentence conclusory explanation for\nits decision:\u201cThe prosecutor\u2019s proffered\nrace-neutral bases for peremptorily striking the two\nAfrican-American jurors were not sufficient to counter the evidence\nof purposeful discrimination in light of the fact that two out of\nthree prospective African-American jurors were stricken, and the\nrecord reflected different treatment of comparably situated\njurors.\u201dId., at 641.That decision is as inexplicable as it is\nunexplained. It is reversed.TheBatsonissue before us turns\nlargely on an \u201cevaluation of credibility.\u201d 476 U. S., at 98, n. 21.\nThe trial court\u2019s determination is entitled to \u201cgreat deference,\u201dibid., and \u201cmust be sustained unless it is clearly\nerroneous,\u201dSnyderv.Louisiana,552 U. S. 472, 477\n(2008).That is the standard on direct review. On\nfederal habeas review, AEDPA \u201cimposes a highly deferential standard\nfor evaluating state-court rulings\u201d and \u201cdemands that state-court\ndecisions be given the benefit of the doubt.\u201dRenicov.Lett, 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 5) (internal\nquotation marks omitted). Here the trial court credited the\nprosecutor\u2019s race-neutral explanations, and the California Court of\nAppeal carefully reviewed the record at some length in upholding\nthe trial court\u2019s findings. The state appellate court\u2019s decision\nwas plainly not unreasonable. There was simply no basis for the\nNinth Circuit to reach the opposite conclusion, particularly in\nsuch a dismissive manner.The petition for certiorari and the motion for\nleave to proceedin forma pauperisare granted. The\njudgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is reversed,\nand the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with\nthis opinion.It is so ordered.",
