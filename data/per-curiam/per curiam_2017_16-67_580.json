    "text": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESRAY WHITE, et\u00a0al.v.DANIEL T.\nPAULY, as personal representative of the ESTATE OF SAMUEL PAULY,\nDECEASED et\u00a0al.on petition for writ of certiorari to the\nunited states court of appeals for the tenth circuitNo. 16\u201367.\u2003Decided January 9, 2017Per Curiam.This case addresses the situation of an officer\nwho\u2014having arrived late at an ongoing police action and having\nwitnessed shots being fired by one of several individualsin a house\nsurrounded by other officers\u2014shoots and kills an armed occupant of\nthe house without first giving a warning.According to the District Court and the Court of\nAppeals, the record, when viewed in the light most favorable to\nrespondents, shows the following. Respondent Daniel Pauly was\ninvolved in a road-rage incident on a highway near Santa\u00a0Fe,\nNew Mexico. 814 F.\u00a03d 1060, 1064\u20131065 (CA10 2016). It was in\nthe evening, and it was raining. The two women involved called 911\nto report Daniel as a \u201c\u00a0\u2018drunk driver\u2019\u00a0\u201d who was\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018swerving all crazy.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId.,at 1065. The women\nthen followed Daniel down the highway, close behind him and with\ntheir bright lights on. Daniel, feeling threatened, pulled his\ntruck over at an off-ramp to confront them. After a brief,\nnonviolent encounter, Daniel drove a short distance to a secluded\nhouse where he lived with his brother, Samuel Pauly.Sometime between 9 p.m. and 10 p.m., Officer\nKevin Truesdale was dispatched to respond to the women\u2019s 911 call.\nTruesdale, arriving after Daniel had already left the scene,\ninterviewed the two women at the off-ramp. The women told Truesdale\nthat Daniel had been driving recklessly and gave his license plate\nnumber to Truesdale. The state police dispatcher identified the\nplate as being registered to the Pauly brothers\u2019 address.After the women left, Officer Truesdale was\njoined at the off-ramp by Officers Ray White and Michael Mariscal.\nThe three agreed there was insufficient probable cause to arrest\nDaniel. Still, the officers decided to speak with Daniel to (1) get\nhis side of the story, (2) \u201c\u00a0\u2018make sure nothing else\nhappened,\u2019\u00a0\u201d and (3) find out if he was intoxicated.Id., at 1065. The officers split up. White stayed at the\noff-ramp in case Daniel returned. Truesdale and Mariscal drove in\nseparate patrol cars to the Pauly brothers\u2019 address, less than a\nhalf mile away. Record 215. Neither officer turned on his flashing\nlights.When Officers Mariscal and Truesdale arrived at\nthe address they had received from the dispatcher, they found two\ndifferent houses, the first with no lights on inside and a second\none behind it on a hill.Id.,at 217, 246. Lights were on in\nthe second one. The officers parked their cars near the first\nhouse. They examined a vehicle parked near that house but did not\nfind Daniel\u2019s truck.Id.,at 310.Officers Mariscal and Truesdale noticed the\nlights on in the second house and approached it in a covert manner\nto maintain officer safety. Both used their flashlights in an\nintermittent manner. Truesdale alone turned on his flashlight once\nthey got close to the house\u2019s front door. Upon reaching the house,\nthe officers found Daniel\u2019s pickup truck and spotted two men moving\naround inside the residence. Truesdale and Mariscal radioed White,\nwho left the off-ramp to join them.At approximately 11 p.m., the Pauly brothers\nbecame aware of the officers\u2019 presence and yelled out \u201c\u00a0\u2018Who\nare you?\u2019\u00a0\u201d and \u201c\u00a0\u2018What do you want?\u2019\u00a0\u201d 814\nF.\u00a03d, at 1066. In response, Officers Mariscal and Truesdale\nlaughed and responded: \u201c\u00a0\u2018Hey, (expletive), we got you\nsurrounded. Come out or we\u2019re coming in.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIbid.Truesdale shouted once: \u201c\u00a0\u2018Open the door, State Police, open\nthe door.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIbid.Mariscal also yelled: \u201c\u00a0\u2018Open\nthe door, open the door.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIbid.The Pauly brothers heard someone yelling,\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018We\u2019re coming in. We\u2019re coming in.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIbid.\nNeither Samuel nor Daniel heard the officers identify themselves as\nstate police. Record 81\u201382. The brothers armed themselves, Samuel\nwith a handgun and Daniel with a shotgun. One of the brothers\nyelled at the police officers that \u201c\u00a0\u2018We have guns.\u2019\u00a0\u201d\n814 F.\u00a03d, at 1066.The officers saw someone run to the\nback of the house, so Officer Truesdale positioned himself behind\nthe house and shouted \u201c\u00a0\u2018Open the door, come outside.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIbid.Officer White had parked at the first house and\nwas walking up to its front door when he heard shouting from the\nsecond house. He half-jogged, half-walked to the Paulys\u2019 house,\narriving \u201cjust as one of the brothers said: \u2018We have guns.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIbid.; see also Civ. No. 12\u20131311 (D NM, Feb. 5, 2014), App.\nto Pet. for Cert. 75\u201378. When White heard that statement, he drew\nhis gun and took cover behind a stone wall 50 feet from the front\nof the house. Officer Mariscal took cover behind a pickup\ntruck.Just \u201ca few seconds\u201d after the \u201cWe have guns\u201d\nstatement, Daniel stepped part way out of the back door and fired\ntwo shotgun blasts while screaming loudly. 814 F.\u00a03d, at\n1066\u20131067. A few seconds after those shots, Samuel opened the front\nwindow and pointed a handgun in Officer White\u2019s direction. Officer\nMariscal fired immediately at Samuel but missed. \u201c\u00a0\u2018Four to\nfive seconds\u2019\u00a0\u201d later, White shot and killed Samuel.Id.,at 1067.The District Court denied the officers\u2019 motions\nfor summary judgment, and the facts are viewed in the light most\nfavorable to the Paulys.Mullenixv.Luna, 577\nU.\u00a0S. ___, ___, n. (2015) (per curiam) (slip op., at 2,\nn.). Because this case concerns the defense of qualified immunity,\nhowever, the Court considers only the facts that were knowable to\nthe defendant officers.Kingsleyv.Hendrickson, 576\nU.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2015) (slip op., at 9).Samuel\u2019s estate and Daniel filed suit against,inter alia, Officers Mariscal, Truesdale, and White. One of\nthe claims was that the officers were liable under Rev. Stat.\n\u00a71979, 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71983, for violating Samuel\u2019s Fourth\nAmendment right to be free from excessive force. All three officers\nmoved for summary judgment on qualified immunity grounds. White in\nparticular argued that the Pauly brothers could not show that\nWhite\u2019s use of force vio-lated the Fourth Amendment and,\nregardless, that Sam-uel\u2019s Fourth Amendment right to be free from\ndeadlyforce under the circumstances of this case was not clearly\nestablished.The District Court denied qualified immunity. A\ndi-vided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Tenth\nCircuitaffirmed. As to Officers Mariscal and Truesdale, the court\nheld that \u201c[a]ccepting as true plaintiffs\u2019 version of the facts, a\nreasonable person in the officers\u2019 position should have understood\ntheir conduct would cause Samuel and Daniel Pauly to defend their\nhome and could result in the commission of deadly force against\nSamuel Pauly by Officer White.\u201d 814 F. 3d, at 1076. The panel\nmajority analyzed Officer White\u2019s claim separately from the other\nofficers because \u201cOfficer White did not participate in the events\nleading up to the armed confrontation, nor was he there to hear the\nother officers ordering the brothers to \u2018Come out or we\u2019re coming\nin.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIbid.Despite the fact that \u201cOfficer White\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. arrived late on the scene and heard only \u2018We have\nguns\u2019 .\u00a0.\u00a0. before taking cover behind a stone wall,\u201d the\nmajority held that a jury could have concluded that White\u2019s use of\ndeadly force was not reasonable.Id.,at 1077, 1082. The\nmajority also decided that this rule\u2014that a reasonable officer in\nWhite\u2019s position would believe that a warning was required despite\nthe threat of serious harm\u2014was clearly established at the time of\nSamuel\u2019s death. The Court of Appeals\u2019 ruling relied on general\nstatements from this Court\u2019s case law that (1) \u201cthe reasonableness\nof an officer\u2019s use of force depends, in part, on whether the\nofficer was in danger at the precise moment that he used force\u201d and\n(2) \u201cif the suspect threatens the officer with a weapon[,] deadly\nforce may be used if necessary to prevent escape, and if[,] where\nfeasible, some warning has been given.\u201dId., at 1083\n(citing,inter alia,Tennesseev.Garner, 471\nU.\u00a0S. 1 (1985) , andGrahamv.Connor, 490\nU.\u00a0S. 386 (1989) ; emphasis deleted; internal quotation marks\nand alterations omitted). The court concluded that a reasonable\nofficer in White\u2019s position would have known that, since the Paulys\ncould not have shot him unless he moved from his position behind a\nstone wall, he could not have used deadly force without first\nwarning Samuel Pauly to drop his weapon.Judge Moritz dissented, contending that the\n\u201cmajority impermissibly second-guesses\u201d Officer White\u2019s quick\nchoice to use deadly force. 814 F.\u00a03d, at 1084. Judge Moritz\nexplained that the majority also erred by defining the clearly\nestablished law at too high a level of generality, in contravention\nof this Court\u2019s precedent.The officers petitioned for rehearing en banc,\nwhich 6 of the 12 judges on the Court of Appeals voted to grant. In\na dissent from denial of rehearing, Judge Hartz noted that he was\n\u201cunaware of any clearly established law that suggests\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. that an officer .\u00a0.\u00a0. who faces an\noccupant pointing a firearm in his direction must refrain from\nfiring his weapon but, rather, must identify himself and shout a\nwarning while pinned down, kneeling behind a rock wall.\u201d 817\nF.\u00a03d 715, 718 (CA10 2016). Judge Hartz expressed his hope\nthat \u201cthe Supreme Court can clarify the governing law.\u201dId.,at 719.The officers petitioned for certiorari. The\npetition is now granted, and the judgment is vacated: Officer White\ndid not violate clearly established law on the record described by\nthe Court of Appeals panel.Qualified immunity attaches when an official\u2019s\nconduct \u201c\u00a0\u2018does not violate clearly established statutory or\nconstitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have\nknown.\u2019\u00a0\u201dMullenixv.Luna, 577 U.\u00a0S., at\n___\u2013___ (slip op., at 4\u20135). While this Court\u2019s case law\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018do[es] not require a case directly on point\u2019\u00a0\u201d for a\nright to be clearly established, \u201c\u00a0\u2018existing precedent must\nhave placed the statutory or constitutional question beyond\ndebate.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId.,at ___ (slip op., at 5). In other\nwords, immunity protects \u201c\u00a0\u2018all but the plainly incompetent or\nthose who knowingly violate the law.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIbid.In the last five years, this Court has issued a\nnumber of opinions reversing federal courts in qualified immunity\ncases. See, e.g., City and County of San Franciscov.Sheehan, 575 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___, n. 3 (2015) (slip op., at\n10, n.3) (collecting cases). The Court has found this necessary\nboth because qualified immunity is important to \u201c\u00a0\u2018society as\na whole,\u2019\u00a0\u201dibid., and because as \u201c\u00a0\u2018an immunity\nfrom suit,\u2019\u00a0\u201d qualified immunity \u201c\u00a0\u2018is effectively lost\nif a case is erroneously permitted to go to trial,\u2019\u00a0\u201dPearsonv.Callahan, 555 U.\u00a0S. 223, 231 (2009)\n.Today, it is again necessary to reiterate the\nlongstanding principle that \u201cclearly established law\u201d should not be\ndefined \u201cat a high level of generality.\u201dAshcroftv.al-Kidd, 563 U.\u00a0S. 731, 742 (2011) . As this Court\nexplained decades ago, the clearly established law must be\n\u201cparticularized\u201d to the facts of the case.Andersonv.Creighton, 483 U.\u00a0S. 635, 640 (1987) . Otherwise,\n\u201c[p]laintiffs would be able to convert the rule of qualified\nimmunity .\u00a0.\u00a0. into a rule of virtually unqualified\nliability simply by alleging violation of extremely abstract\nrights.\u201dId.,at 639.The panel majority misunderstood the \u201cclearly\nestablished\u201d analysis: It failed to identify a case where an\nofficer acting under similar circumstances as Officer White was\nheld to have violated the Fourth Amendment. Instead, the majority\nrelied onGraham,Garner, and their Court of Appeals\nprogeny, which\u2014as noted above\u2014lay out excessive-force principles at\nonly a general level. Of course, \u201cgeneral statements of the law are\nnot inherently incapable of giving fair and clear warning\u201d to\nofficers,United Statesv.Lanier, 520 U.\u00a0S.\n259, 271 (1997) , but \u201cin the light of pre-existing law the\nunlawfulness must be apparent,\u201dAndersonv.Creighton,supra, at 640. For that reason, we have\nheld thatGarnerandGrahamdo notby themselves\ncreate clearly established law outside\u201can obvious case.\u201dBrosseauv.Haugen, 543 U.\u00a0S. 194 ,199 (2004)\n(per curiam); see alsoPlumhoffv.Rickard,572\nU.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 13) (emphasiz-ing thatGarnerandGraham\u201care \u2018cast at a high level of\ngenerality\u2019\u00a0\u201d).This is not a case where it is obvious that\nthere was a violation of clearly established law underGarnerandGraham. Of note, the majority did not\nconclude that White\u2019s conduct\u2014such as his failure to shout a\nwarning\u2014constituted a run-of-the-mill Fourth Amendment violation.\nIndeed, it recognized that \u201cthis case presents a unique set of\nfacts and circumstances\u201d in light of White\u2019s late arrival on the\nscene. 814 F.\u00a03d, at 1077. This alone should have been an\nimportant indication to the majority that White\u2019s conduct did not\nviolate a \u201cclearly established\u201d right. Clearly established federal\nlaw does not prohibit a reasonable officer who arrives late to an\nongoing police action in circumstances like this from assuming that\nproper procedures, such as officer identification, have already\nbeen followed. No settled Fourth Amendment principle requires that\nofficer to second-guess the earlier steps already taken by his or\nher fellow officers in instances like the one White confronted\nhere.On the record described by the Court of Appeals,\nOfficer White did not violate clearly established law. The Court\nnotes, however, that respondents contend Officer White arrived on\nthe scene only two minutes after Officers Truesdale and Mariscal\nand more than three minutes before Daniel\u2019s shots were fired. On\nthe assumption that the conduct of Officers Truesdale and Mariscal\ndid not adequately alert the Paulys that they were police officers,\nrespondents suggest that a reasonable jury could infer that White\nwitnessed the other officers\u2019 deficient performance and should have\nrealized that corrective action was necessary before using deadly\nforce. Brief in Opposition 11, 22, n.\u00a05. This Court expresses\nno position on this potential alternative ground for affirmance, as\nit appears that neither the District Court nor the Court of Appeals\npanel addressed it. The Court also expresses no opinion on the\nquestion whether this ground was properly preserved or whether\u2014in\nlight of this Court\u2019s holding today\u2014Officers Truesdale and Mariscal\nare entitled to qualified immunity.For the foregoing reasons, the petition for\ncertiorari is granted; the judgment of the Court of Appeals is\nvacated; and the case is remanded for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.",
