    "text": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESSTEVEN LEFEMINE, dba COLUMBIA CHRISTIANS FOR\nLIFEv.DAN WIDEMAN et al.on petition for writ of certiorari to the\nunited states court of appeals for the fourth circuitNo. 12\u2013168.\u2003Decided November 5, 2012Per Curiam.This case concerns the award of attorney\u2019s fees\nin a suit alleging unconstitutional conduct by government\nofficials. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth\nCircuit held that a plaintiff who secured a permanent injunction\nbut no monetary damages was not a \u201cprevailing party\u201d under 42\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71988, and so could not receive fees. That was\nerror. Because the injunction ordered the defendant officials to\nchange their behavior in a way that directly benefited the\nplaintiff, we vacate the Fourth Cir- cuit\u2019s decision and remand for\nfurther proceedings.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*Petitioner Steven Lefemine and members of\nColumbia Christians for Life (CCL) engage in demonstrations in\nwhich they carry pictures of aborted fetuses to protest the\navailability of abortions. On November 3, 2005, Lefemine and about\n20 other CCL members conducted such a demonstration at a busy\nintersection in Greenwood County, South Carolina. Citing complaints\nabout the graphic signs, a Greenwood County police officer informed\nLefemine that if the signs were not discarded, he would be ticketed\nfor breach of the peace. Lefemine objected, asserting that the\nofficer was violating his First Amendment rights, but the threat\neventually caused him to disband the protest. SeeLefeminev.Davis, 732 F. Supp. 2d 614, 617\u2013619 (SC 2010).A year later, an attorney for Lefemine sent a\nletter to Dan Wideman, the sheriff of Greenwood County, informing\nhim that the group intended to return to the same site with the\ndisputed signs. The letter cautioned that further interference\nwould cause Lefemine \u201c\u00a0\u2018to pursue all avail- able legal\nremedies.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId.,at 619. Chief Deputy Mike Frederick\nresponded that the police had not previously violated Lefemine\u2019s\nrights, and warned that \u201c\u00a0\u2018should we observe any protester or\ndemonstrator committing the same act, we will again conduct\nourselves in exactly the same manner: order the person(s) to stop\nor face criminal sanctions.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIbid.Out of fear of\nthose sanctions, the group chose not to protest in the county for\nthe next two years. Seeibid.On October 31, 2008, Lefemine filed a complaint\nunder 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71983 against several Greenwood County\npolice officers alleging violations of his First Amendment rights.\nLefemine sought nominal damages, a declaratory judgment, a\npermanent injunction, and attorney\u2019s fees. See 732 F.\u00a0Supp.\n2d, at 620. Ruling on the parties\u2019 dueling motions for summary\njudgment, the District Court determined that the defendants had\ninfringed Lefemine\u2019s rights. Seeid.,at 620\u2013625. The court\ntherefore permanently enjoined the defendants \u201cfrom engaging in\ncontent-based restrictions on [Lefemine\u2019s] display of graphic\nsigns\u201d under similar circumstances.Id.,at 627. The court,\nhowever, refused Lefemine\u2019s request for nominal damages, finding\nthat the defendants were entitled to qualified immunity because the\nillegality of their conduct was not clearly established at the\ntime. Seeibid.The court as well denied Lefemine\u2019s request\nfor attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a71988, stating that \u201c[u]nder the totality\nof the facts in this case the award of attorney\u2019s fees is not\nwarranted.\u201dIbid.The Fourth Circuit affirmed the denial of\nattorney\u2019s fees on the ground that the District Court\u2019s judgment\ndid not make Lefemine a \u201cprevailing party\u201d under \u00a71988. 672 F.3d\n292, 302\u2013303 (2012).[1] The\ncourt reasoned that the relief awarded did not \u201c\u00a0\u2018alte[r] the\nrelative positions of the parties\u2019\u00a0\u201d: The injunction\nprohibited only \u201cunlawful, but not legitimate, conduct by the\ndefendant[s],\u201d and merely \u201cordered [d]efendants to comply with the\nlaw and safeguard [Lefemine\u2019s] constitutional rights in the future.\nNo other damages were awarded.\u201dIbid.Lefemine sought a writ\nof certiorari to review the Fourth Circuit\u2019s determination that he\nwas not a prevailing party under \u00a71988.The Civil Rights Attorney\u2019s Fees Awards Act of\n1976, 90Stat. 2641, 42 U. S. C. \u00a71988, allows \u201cthe prevailing\nparty\u201d in certain civil rights actions, including suits brought\nunder \u00a71983, to recover \u201ca reasonable attorney\u2019s fee.\u201d A plaintiff\n\u201cprevails,\u201d we have held, \u201cwhen actual relief on the merits of his\nclaim materially alters the legal relationship between the parties\nby modifying the defendant\u2019s behavior in a way that directly\nbenefits the plaintiff.\u201dFarrarv.Hobby,506 U.S.\n103, 111\u2013112 (1992). And we have repeatedly held that an\ninjunction or declaratory judgment, like a damages award, will\nusually satisfy that test. See,e.g.,Rhodesv.Stewart,488 U.S.\n1, 4 (1988) (per curiam).Under these established standards, Lefemine was\na prevailing party. Lefemine desired to conduct demonstrations in\nGreenwood County with signs that the defendant police officers had\ntold him he could not carry. He brought this suit in part to secure\nan injunction to protect himself from the defendants\u2019 standing\nthreat of sanctions. And he succeeded in removing that threat. The\nDistrict Court held that the defendants had violated Lefemine\u2019s\nrights and enjoined them from engaging in similar conduct in the\nfuture. Contrary to the Fourth Circuit\u2019s view, that ruling worked\nthe requisite material alteration in the parties\u2019 relationship.\nBefore the ruling, the police intended to stop Lefemine from\nprotesting with his signs; after the ruling, the police could not\nprevent him from demonstrating in that manner. So when the District\nCourt \u201cordered [d]efendants to comply with the law,\u201d 672\nF.\u00a03d, at 303, the relief given\u2014as in the usual case involving\nsuch an injunction\u2014supported the award of attorney\u2019s fees.Because Lefemine is a \u201cprevailing party,\u201d he\n\u201cshould ordinarily recover an attorney\u2019s fee unless special\ncircumstances would render such an award unjust.\u201dHensleyv.Eckerhart,461 U.S.\n424, 429 (1983) (internal quotation marks omitted). Neither of\nthe courts below addressed whether any special circumstances exist\nin this case, and we do not do so; whether there may be other\ngrounds on which the police officers could contest liability for\nfees is not a question before us. Accordingly, the petition for\ncertiorari is granted, the judgment of the Fourth Circuit is\nvacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.Notes1The defendants did not\nappeal the District Court\u2019s judgment that they had violated\nLefemine\u2019s First Amendment rights, so the Court of Appeals took as\na given that a violation had occurred. See 672 F.\u00a03d, at 299,\nn.\u00a05.",
