S. ____ (2006)SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESKEITH LANCE, et\u00a0al., APPELLANTSv.GIGI DENNIS, COLORADO SECRETARY OF STATEon appeal from the united states district court for\nthe district of coloradoNo. 05\u2013555.\u2003Decided February 21, 2006Per Curiam.TheRooker-Feldmandoctrine prevents the lower federal courts from exercising\njurisdiction over cases brought by \u201cstate-court losers\u201d challenging\n\u201cstate-court judgments rendered before the district court\nproceedings commenced.\u201dExxon Mobil Corp.v.Saudi\nBasic Industries Corp.,544 U. S. 280, 284\n(2005). In this case, the District Court dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 suit\non the ground that they were in privity with a state-court loser.\nWe hold that theRooker-Feldmandoctrine does not bar\nplaintiffs from proceeding, and vacate the District Court\u2019s\njudgment.IThis is the latest of several\nrounds of litigation involving the State of Colorado\u2019s\ncongressional redistricting after the 2000 census, under which the\nState gained a seat in the House of Representatives.Lancev.Davidson, 379 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d 1117, 1121 (2005). The\nfirst round began in May 2001. When the Colorado General Assembly\nfailed to pass a redistricting plan for the 2002 congressional\nelections by the close of its regular session, a group of Colorado\nvoters asked the state courts to create a plan. The courts agreed,\ndrawing a new map reflecting the additional district. SeeBeauprezv.Avalos, 42 P.\u00a03d 642 (Colo.\n2002) (en banc). The 2002 elections were held using this\ncourt-ordered plan.The General Assembly passed its\nown redistricting plan in the spring of 2003, prompting further\nlitigation\u2014this time about which electoral map was to govern, the\nlegislature\u2019s or the court\u2019s. Two suits were filed seeking to\nenjoin the legislature\u2019s plan: an original action in the Colorado\nSupreme Court by the state attorney general seeking to require the\nsecretary of state to use the court-ordered plan, and a similar\naction brought in a lower state court by several proponents of the\ncourt-ordered plan. 379 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d, at 1121. After the\nColorado General Assembly intervened to defend its plan in the\nfirst case, the Colorado Supreme Court held that the plan violated\nArticle V, \u00a744, of the State Constitution, which the court\nconstrued to limit congressional redistricting to \u201conce per\ndecade.\u201dPeople ex rel. Salazarv.Davidson,79\nP.\u00a03d 1221, 1231 (2003) (en banc). It therefore ordered the\nsecretary of state to use the court-created plan. We denied\ncertiorari.541 U.\nS. 1093(2004).The second suit was removed to federal court\nby the defendants on the basis of plaintiffs\u2019 federal-law claims.\nSeeKellerv.Davidson,299 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d\n1171, 1175 (Colo. 2004). OnceSalazarwas decided by the\nColorado Supreme Court, the viability of the defendants\u2019\ncounterclaims was the only remaining issue. A three-judge District\nCourt held that the defendants were barred by theRooker-Feldmandoctrine from amending their counterclaims\nto assert additional challenges to the decision inSalazar. It also held that the defendants\u2019 original\ncounterclaims, while not barred by theRooker-Feldmandoctrine, were precluded under Colorado law by the judgment inSalazar. Accordingly, the court dismissed the case.Finally, this suit: Before the dismissal inKeller, several Colorado citizens unhappy withSalazarfiled an action in the District Court seeking to\nrequire the secretary of state to use the legislature\u2019s\nplan.[Footnote 1] The\nplaintiffs argued that Article V, \u00a744, of the Colorado\nConstitution, as interpreted by the Colorado Supreme Court,\nviolated the Elections Clause of Article I, \u00a74, of the U. S.\nConstitution (\u201cThe Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections\nfor Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State\nby the Legislature thereof\u201d), and the First Amendment\u2019s Petition\nClause (\u201cCongress shall make no law \u2026 abridging \u2026 the right of the\npeople \u2026 to petition the Government for a redress of grievances\u201d).\nThe defendants filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that theRooker-Feldmandoctrine and Colorado preclusion law barred\nany attack on the Colorado Supreme Court\u2019s judgment inSalazarand that the plaintiffs had failed to state a\nvalid Petition Clause claim.The three-judge District Court ruled that\nunder theRooker-Feldmandoctrine, it had no jurisdiction\nto hear the Elections Clause claim. 379 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d, at 1127.\nTheRooker-Feldmandoctrine, the court explained, includes\nthree requirements: (1) \u201cthe party against whom the doctrine is\ninvoked must have actually been a party to the prior state-court\njudgment or have been in privity with such a party\u201d; (2) \u201cthe claim\nraised in the federal suit must have been actually raised or\ninextricably intertwined with the state-court judgment\u201d; and (3)\n\u201cthe federal claim must not be parallel to the state-court claim.\u201d\n379 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d, at 1124. The District Court found the first\nrequirement satisfied on the ground that the citizen plaintiffs\nwere in privity with the Colorado General Assembly\u2014a losing party\ninSalazar.Relying on our decisions inWashingtonv.Washington State Commercial Passenger\nFishing Vessel Assn.,443 U. S. 658(1979),\nandTacomav.Taxpayers of Tacoma,357 U. S. 320(1958),\nthe court stated that \u201cwhen a state government litigates a matter\nof public concern, that state\u2019s citizens will be deemed to be in\nprivity with the government for preclusion purposes.\u201d 379\nF.\u00a0Supp. 2d, at 1125. This principle, the court reasoned,\napplies \u201cwith equal force in theRooker-Feldmancontext.\u201dIbid. The court went on to conclude that the Elections\nClause claim was actually raised inSalazar,or\ninextricably intertwined with that decision, and was not parallel\nto the claims presented inSalazar. As to the Petition\nClause claim, the court ruled that neitherRooker-Feldmannor Colorado preclusion law prevented the court from proceeding to\nthe merits, but that plaintiffs failed to state a claim. 379\nF.\u00a0Supp. 2d, at 1132; see Fed. Rule Civ.\nProc.\u00a012(b)(6).The plaintiffs appealed. See 28 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a71253. We now note jurisdiction, and address whether theRooker-Feldmandoctrine bars the plaintiffs from\nproceeding because they were in privity with a party inSalazar. We conclude it does not, and vacate the judgment\nof the District Court.IIThis Court is vested, under 28 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a71257, with jurisdiction over appeals from final\nstate-court judgments. We have held that this grant of jurisdiction\nis exclusive: \u201cReview of such judgments may be hadonlyin\nthis Court.\u201dDistrict of Columbia Court of Appealsv.Feldman,460 U. S. 462, 482\n(1983) (emphasis added); see alsoAtlantic Coast Line R.\nCo.v.Locomotive Engineers,398 U. S. 281, 286\n(1970);Rookerv.Fidelity Trust Co.,263 U. S. 413, 416\n(1923). Accordingly, under what has come to be known as theRooker-Feldmandoctrine, lower federal courts are\nprecluded from exercising appellate jurisdiction over final\nstate-court judgments.TheRooker-Feldmandoctrine takes its name from the only two cases in which we have\napplied this rule to find that a federal district court lacked\njurisdiction. InRooker, a party who had lost in the\nIndiana Supreme Court, and failed to obtain review in this Court,\nfiled an action in federal district court challenging the\nconstitutionality of the state-court judgment. We viewed the action\nas tantamount to an appeal of the Indiana Supreme Court decision,\nover which only this Court had jurisdiction, and said that the\n\u201caggrieved litigant cannot be permitted to do indirectly what he no\nlonger can do directly.\u201d 263 U. S., at 416.Feldman,\ndecided 60 years later, concerned slightly different circumstances,\nwith similar results. The plaintiffs there had been refused\nadmission to the District of Columbia bar by the District of\nColumbia Court of Appeals, and sought review of these decisions in\nfederal district court. Our decision held that to the extent\nplaintiffs challenged the Court of Appeals decisions themselves\u2014as\nopposed to the bar admission rules promulgated nonjudicially by the\nCourt of Appeals\u2014their sole avenue of review was with this Court.\n460 U. S., at 476.NeitherRookernorFeldmanelaborated a rationale for a wide-reaching bar on the jurisdiction\nof lower federal courts, and our cases sinceFeldmanhave\ntended to emphasize the narrowness of theRooker-Feldmanrule. SeeExxon Mobil,544 U. S., at 292\n(Rooker-Feldmandoes not apply to parallel state and\nfederal litigation);Verizon Md. Inc.v.Public Serv.\nComm\u2019n of Md.,535 U. S. 635, 644, n. 3\n(2002) (Rooker-Feldman\u201chas no application to judicial\nreview of executive action, including determinations made by a\nstate administrative agency\u201d);Johnsonv.De\nGrandy,512 U.\nS. 997, 1005\u20131006 (1994) (Rooker-Feldmandoes not bar\nactions by a nonparty to the earlier state suit). Indeed, during\nthat period, \u201cthis Court has never appliedRooker-Feldmanto dismiss an action for want of jurisdiction.\u201dExxon\nMobil,supra,at 287.InExxon Mobil, decided last Term, we\nwarned that the lower courts have at times extendedRooker-Feldman\u201cfar beyond the contours of theRookerandFeldmancases, overriding Congress\u2019\nconferral of federal-court jurisdiction concurrent with\njurisdiction exercised by state courts, and superseding the\nordinary application of preclusion law pursuant to 28 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a71738.\u201d 544 U. S., at 283.Rooker-Feldman, we explained,\nis a narrow doctrine, confined to \u201ccases brought by state-court\nlosers complaining of injuries caused by state-court judgments\nrendered before the district court proceedings commenced and\ninviting district court review and rejection of those judgments.\u201d\n544 U. S., at 284.Although we have never addressed the precise\nquestion before us, we have heldRooker-Feldmaninapplicable where the party against whom the doctrine is invoked\nwas not a party to the underlying state-court proceeding. SeeDe Grandy, supra,at 1006. InDe Grandy,the\nState of Florida sought, usingRooker-Feldman, to prevent\nthe United States from bringing a challenge under \u00a72 of the Voting\nRights Act of 1965 to the reapportionment of state electoral\ndistricts. The Florida Supreme Court, in an action initiated by the\nstate attorney general, had already declared the law valid under\nstate and federal law. We held thatRooker-Feldmandid not\nbar the United States from bringing its own action in federal court\nbecause the United States \u201cwas not a party in the state court,\u201d and\n\u201cwas in no position to ask this Court to review the state court\u2019s\njudgment and has not directly attacked it in this proceeding.\u201d 512\nU. S., at 1006.In the case before us, plaintiffs were plainly\nnot parties to the underlying state-court proceeding inSalazar.Salazarwas an action brought by the\nstate attorney general against the secretary of state, in which the\nColorado General Assembly intervened. 79 P.\u00a03d, at 1227. The\nfour citizen-plaintiffs here did not participate inSalazar, and were not in a \u201cposition to ask this Court to\nreview the state court\u2019s judgment.\u201dDe Grandy,supra,at 1006; seeKarcherv.May,484 U. S. 72, 77\n(1987) (\u201c[T]he general rule [is] that one who is not a party or has\nnot been treated as a party to a judgment has no right to appeal\ntherefrom\u201d).Although the District Court recognized the\n\u201cgeneral rule\u201d that \u201cRooker-Feldmanmay not be invoked\nagainst a federal-court plaintiff who was not actually a party to\nthe prior state-court judgment,\u201d 379 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d, at 1123, it\nnevertheless followed Tenth Circuit precedent in allowing\napplication ofRooker-Feldmanagainst parties who were in\nprivity with a party to the earlier state-court action. 379\nF.\u00a0Supp. 2d, at 1123 (citingKenmen Eng.v.Union,314 F.\u00a03d 468, 481 (2002)). In determining\nwhether privity existed, the court looked to cases concerning the\npreclusive effect that state courts are required to give\nfederal-court judgments. 379 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d, at 1125 (citingWashington,443 U. S., at 693, n.\u00a032;Taxpayers\nof Tacoma,357 U. S., at 340\u2013341). It concluded that\u2014forRooker-Feldmanas well as preclusion purposes\u2014\u201cthe outcome\nof the government\u2019s litigation over a matter of public concern\nbinds its citizens.\u201d 379 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d, at 1125.The District Court erroneously conflated\npreclusion law withRooker-Feldman. Whatever the impact of\nprivity principles on preclusion rules,Rooker-Feldmanis\nnot simply preclusion by another name. The doctrine applies only in\n\u201climited circumstances,\u201dExxon Mobil,supra, at\n291, where a party in effect seeks to take an appeal of an\nunfavorable state-court decision to a lower federal court. TheRooker-Feldmandoctrine does not bar actions by nonparties\nto the earlier state-court judgment simply because, for purposes of\npreclusion law, they could be considered in privity with a party to\nthe judgment.[Footnote 2]A more expansiveRooker-Feldmanrule\nwould tend to supplant Congress\u2019 mandate, under the Full Faith and\nCredit Act, 28 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71738, that federal courts\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018give the same preclusive effect to state court judgments\nthat those judgments would be given in the courts of the State from\nwhich the judgments emerged.\u2019\u00a0\u201dBakerv.General\nMotors Corp.,522 U. S. 222, 246\n(1998) (quotingKremerv.Chemical Constr. Corp.,456 U. S. 461,\n466 (1982)); seeExxon Mobil, supra, at 293. Congress has\ndirected federal courts to look principally tostatelaw\nin deciding what effect to give state-court judgments.\nIncorporation of preclusion principles intoRooker-Feldmanrisks turning that limited doctrine into a uniformfederalrule governing the preclusive effect of state-court judgments,\ncontrary to the Full Faith and Credit Act.[Footnote 3]*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*The judgment of the District\nCourt is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.Footnote 1Although the secretary of state defended the\nlegislature\u2019s plan inSalazar, following that decision she\nagreed to defend the court-ordered plan in this litigation and to\nallow the state attorney general to represent her. 379\nF.\u00a0Supp. 2d 1117, 1122, n.\u00a03 (Colo. 2005).Footnote 2In holding thatRooker-Feldmandoes\nnot bar plaintiffs here from proceeding, we need not address\nwhether there areanycircumstances, however limited, in\nwhichRooker-Feldmanmay be applied against a party not\nnamed in an earlier state proceeding\u2014e.g., where an estate\ntakes ade factoappeal in a district court of an earlier\nstate decision involving the decedent.Footnote 3Our holding also disposes of the claim, which\nthe District Court did not reach, that plaintiffs were barred byRooker-Feldmanbecause they were in privity with the\nsecretary of state, the other losing party inPeople ex rel.\nSalazarv.Davidson, 79 P.\u00a03d 1221 (Colo. 2003)\n(en banc). We do not pass on the District Court\u2019s resolution of the\nmerits of plaintiffs\u2019 Petition Clause claim.",
