Barkes was taken to the Howard\nR. Young Correctional Institution in Wilmington, Delaware. As part\nof Barkes\u2019s intake, a nurse who worked for the contractor providing\nhealthcare at the Institution conducted a medical evaluation.Id., at 311.The evaluation included a mental health\nscreening designed in part to assess whether an inmate was\nsuicidal. The nurse employed a suicide screening form based on a\nmodel form developed by the National Commission on Correctional\nHealth Care (NCCHC) in 1997. The form listed 17 suicide risk\nfactors. If the inmate\u2019s responses and nurse\u2019s observations\nindicated that at least eight were present, or if certain serious\nrisk factors were present, the nurse would notify a physician and\ninitiate suicide prevention measures.Id., at 311, 313.Barkes disclosed that he had a history of\npsychiatric treatment and was on medication. He also disclosed that\nhe had attempted suicide in 2003, though not\u2014as far as the record\nindicates\u2014that he had also done so on three other occasions. And he\nindicated that he was not cur-rently thinking about killing\nhimself. Because only two risk factors were apparent, the nurse\ngave Barkes a \u201croutine\u201d referral to mental health services and did\nnot initiate any special suicide prevention measures.Id.,\nat 311.Barkes was placed in a cell by himself. Despite\nwhat he had told the nurse, that evening he called his wife and\ntold her that he \u201ccan\u2019t live this way anymore\u201d and was going to\nkill himself. Barkes\u2019s wife did not inform anyone at the\nInstitution of this call. The next morning, correctional officers\nobserved Barkes awake and behaving normally at 10:45, 10:50, and\n11:00 a.m. At 11:35 a.m., however, an officer arrived to deliver\nlunch and discovered that Barkes had hanged himself with a sheet.Id., at 311\u2013312.Barkes\u2019s wife and children, respondents here,\nbrought suit under Rev. Stat. \u00a71979, 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71983,\nagainst various entities and individuals connected with the\nInstitution, who they claimed had violated Barkes\u2019s civil rights in\nfailing to prevent his suicide. At issue here is a claim against\npetitioners Stanley Taylor, Commissioner of the Delaware Department\nof Correction (DOC), and Raphael Williams, the Institution\u2019s\nwarden. Although it is undisputed that neither petitioner had\npersonally interacted with Barkes or knew of his condition before\nhis death, respondents alleged that Taylor and Williams had\nviolated Barkes\u2019s constitutional right to be free from cruel and\nunusual punishment.Barkesv.First Correctional Medical,\nInc., 2008 WL 523216, *7 (D Del., Feb. 27, 2008). They did so,\naccording to respondents, by failing to supervise and monitor the\nprivate contractor that provided the medical treatment\u2014including\nthe intake screening\u2014at the Institution. Petitioners moved for\nsummary judgment on the ground that they were entitled to qualified\nimmu-nity, but the District Court denied the motion.Barkesv.First Correctional Medical, Inc., 2012 WL 2914915, *8\u2013*12\n(D Del., July 17, 2012).A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the\nThird Circuit affirmed. The majority first determined that\nrespondents had alleged a cognizable theory of supervisory\nliability (a decision upon which we express no view). 766\nF.\u00a03d, at 316\u2013325. The majority then turned to the two-step\nqualified immunity inquiry, asking \u201cfirst, whether the plaintiff\nsuffered a deprivation of a constitutional or stat-utory right; and\nsecond, if so, whether that right was \u2018clearly established\u2019 at the\ntime of the alleged misconduct.\u201dId., at 326.Taking these questions in reverse order, the\nThird Circuit held that it was clearly established at the time of\nBarkes\u2019s death that an incarcerated individual had an Eighth\nAmendment \u201cright to the proper implementation of adequate suicide\nprevention protocols.\u201dId., at 327. The panel majority then\nconcluded there were material factual disputes about whether\npetitioners had violated this right by failing to adequately\nsupervise the contractor providing medical services at the prison.\nThere was evidence, the majority noted, that the medical\ncontractor\u2019s suicide screening process did not comply with NCCHC\u2019s\nlatest standards, as required by the contract. Those standards\nallegedly called for a revised screening form and for screening by\na qualified mental health professional, not a nurse. There was also\nevidence that the contractor did not have access to Barkes\u2019s\nprobation records (which would have shed light on his mental health\nhistory), and that the contractor had been short-staffing to\nincrease profits.Id., at 330\u2013331.Judge Hardiman dissented. As relevant here, he\nconcluded that petitioners were entitled to qualified immu-nity\nbecause the right on which the majority relied was \u201ca departure\nfrom Eighth Amendment case law that had never been established\nbefore today.\u201dId., at 345.Taylor and Williams petitioned for certiorari.\nWe grant the petition and reverse on the ground that there was no\nviolation of clearly established law.\u201cQualified immunity shields government officials\nfrom civil damages liability unless the official violated a\nstatutory or constitutional right that was clearly established at\nthe time of the challenged conduct.\u201dReichlev.Howards, 566 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 5).\n\u201cTo be clearly established, a right must be sufficiently clear that\nevery reasonable official would have understood that what he is\ndoing violates that right.\u201dIbid.(brackets and internal\nquotation marks omitted). \u201cWhen properly applied, [qualified\nimmunity] protects all but the plainly incompetent or those who\nknowingly violate the law.\u201dAshcroftv.al-Kidd, 563\nU.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 12) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). \u201cWe do not require a case directly on point, but\nexisting precedent must have placed the statutory or constitutional\nquestion beyond debate.\u201dId., at ___ (slip op., at 9).The Third Circuit concluded that the right at\nissue was best defined as \u201can incarcerated person\u2019s right to the\nproper implementation of adequate suicide prevention protocols.\u201d\n766 F.\u00a03d, at 327. This purported right, however, was not\nclearly established in November 2004 in a way that placed beyond\ndebate the unconstitutionality of the Institution\u2019s procedures, as\nimplemented by the medical contractor.No decision of this Court establishes a right to\ntheproper implementation of adequate suicide prevention pro-tocols.\nNo decision of this Court even discusses suicide screening or\nprevention protocols. And \u201cto the extent that a \u2018robust consensus\nof cases of persuasive authority\u2019\u00a0\u201d in the Courts of Appeals\n\u201ccould itself clearly establish the federal right respondent\nalleges,\u201dCity and County of San Franciscov.Sheehan, 575 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2015) (slip op., at 16),\nthe weight of that authority at the time of Barkes\u2019s death\nsuggested that such a right didnotexist. See,e.g.,Comstockv.McCrary, 273 F.\u00a03d 693, 702 (CA6\n2001) (\u201cthe right to medical care for serious medical needs does\nnot encompass the right to be screened correctly for suicidal\ntendencies\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted));Tittlev.Jefferson Cty. Comm\u2019n, 10 F.\u00a03d 1535, 1540 (CA11 1994)\n(alleged \u201cweaknesses in the [suicide] screening process, the\ntraining of deputies[,] and the supervision of prisoners\u201d did not\n\u201camount to a showing of deliberate indifference toward the rights\nof prisoners\u201d);Burnsv.Galveston, 905 F.\u00a02d\n100, 104 (CA5 1990) (rejecting the proposition that \u201cthe right of\ndetainees to adequate medical care includes an absolute right to\npsychological screening\u201d);Belcherv.Oliver, 898\nF.\u00a02d 32, 34\u201335 (CA4 1990) (\u201cThe general right of pretrial\ndetainees to receive basic medical care does not place upon jail\nofficials the responsibility to screen every detainee for suicidal\ntendencies.\u201d).The Third Circuit nonetheless found this right\nclearly established by two of its own decisions, both stemming from\nthe same case. Assuming for the sake of argument that a right can\nbe \u201cclearly established\u201d by circuit precedent despite disagreement\nin the courts of appeals, neither of the Third Circuit decisions\nrelied upon clearly established the right at issue. The first,Colburn I, said that if officials \u201cknow or should know of\nthe particular vulner-ability to suicide of an inmate,\u201d they have\nan obligation \u201cnot to act with reckless indifference to that\nvulnerability.\u201dColburnv.Upper Darby Twp., 838\nF.\u00a02d 663, 669 (1988). The decision did not say, however, that\ndetention facilities must implement procedures to identify such\nvulnerable inmates, let alone specify what procedures would\nsuffice. And the Third Circuit later acknowledged thatColburn\nI\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cor should know\u201d\u2014which might seem\nto nod toward a screening requirement of some kind\u2014was erroneous in\nlight ofFarmerv.Brennan, 511 U.\u00a0S. 825 (1994)\n, which held that Eighth Amendment liability requires actual\nawareness of risk. SeeSerafinv.Johnstown, 53 Fed.\nAppx. 211, 213 (CA3 2002).Nor wouldColburn IIhave put petitioners\non notice of any possible constitutional violation.Colburn\nIIreiter-ated that officials who know of an inmate\u2019s\nparticular vul-nerability to suicide must not be recklessly\nindifferent to that vulnerability.Colburnv.Upper Darby\nTwp., 946 F.\u00a02d 1017, 1023 (1991). But it did not identify\nany minimum screening procedures or prevention protocols that\nfacilities must use. In fact,Colburn IIrevealed that the\nbooking process of the jail at issue \u201cinclude[d] no formal physical\nor mental health screening,\u201dibid., and yet the Third\nCircuit ruled for the defendants on all claims, seeid., at\n1025\u20131031.In short, even if the Institution\u2019s suicide\nscreening and prevention measures contained the shortcomings that\nrespondents allege, no precedent on the books in November 2004\nwould have made clear to petitioners that they were overseeing a\nsystem that violated the Constitution. Because, at the very least,\npetitioners were not contravening clearly established law, they are\nentitled to qualified immunity. The judgment of the Third Circuit\nis reversed.It is so ordered.",
