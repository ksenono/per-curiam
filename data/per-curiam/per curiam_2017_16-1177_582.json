In this case, the Court of Appeals\nfor the Fourth Circuit held that this demanding standard was met by\na Virginia court\u2019s application ofGrahamv.Florida,\n560 U.\u00a0S. 48 (2010) . The question presented is whether the\nCourt of Appeals erred in concluding that the state court\u2019s ruling\ninvolved an unreasonable application of this Court\u2019s holding.IOn July 6, 1999, respondent Dennis LeBlanc\nraped a 62-year-old woman. He was 16 at the time. In 2003, a state\ntrial court sentenced him to life in prison for his crimes. In the\n1990\u2019s, Virginia had, for felony offenders, abolished parole that\nfollowed a traditional framework. See Va. Code Ann. \u00a753.1\u2013165.1\n(2013). As a form of replacement, Virginia enacted its so-called\n\u201cgeriatric release\u201d program, which allows older inmates to receive\nconditional release under some circumstances.LeBlancv.Mathena, 841 F.\u00a03d 256, 261 (CA4 2016) (citing Va. Code\nAnn. \u00a753.1\u201340.01).Seven years after respondent was sentenced, this\nCourt decidedGrahamv.Florida.Grahamestablished that the Eighth Amendment prohibits juvenile offenders\nconvicted of nonhomicide offenses from being sentenced to life\nwithout parole. While a \u201cState is not required to guarantee\neventual freedom to a juvenile offender convicted of a nonhomicide\ncrime,\u201d the Court held, it must \u201cgive defendants like Graham some\nmeaningful opportunity to obtain release based on demonstrated\nmaturity and rehabilitation.\u201d 540 U.\u00a0S., at 75. The Court inGrahamleft it to the States, \u201cin the first instance, to\nexplore the means and mechanisms for compliance\u201d with theGrahamrule.Ibid.Respondent later filed a motion in state trial\ncourt\u2014the Virginia Beach Circuit Court\u2014seeking to vacate his\nsentence in light ofGraham. The trial court denied the\nmotion. In so doing, it relied on the Supreme Court of Virginia\u2019s\ndecision inAngelv.Commonwealth, 281 Va. 248, 704\nS.\u00a0E. 2d 386 (2011). TheAngelcourt held that\nVirginia\u2019s geriatric release program satisfiesGraham\u2019s\nrequirement of parole for juvenile offenders. The statute\nestablishing the program provides:\u201cAny person serving a sentence imposed\nupon a conviction for a felony offense .\u00a0.\u00a0. (i) who has\nreached the age of sixty-five or older and who has served at least\nfive years of the sentence imposed or (ii) who has reached the age\nof sixty or older and who has served at least ten years of the\nsentence imposed may petition the Parole Board for conditional\nrelease.\u201d \u00a753.1\u201340.01.TheAngelcourt explained that \u201c[t]he\nregulations for conditional release under this statute provide that\nif the prisoner meets the qualifications for consideration\ncontained in the statute, the factors used in the normal parole\nconsideration process apply to conditional release decisions under\nthis statute.\u201d 281 Va., at 275, 704 S. E. 2d, at 402. The geriatric\nrelease program thus complied withGraham, theAngelcourt held, because it provided \u201cthe meaningful opportunity to\nobtain release based on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation\nrequired by the Eighth Amendment.\u201d 281 Va., at 275, 704 S.\u00a0E.\n2d, at 402 (internal quotation marks omitted).The Virginia Supreme Court, in reviewing the\ntrial court\u2019s ruling in the instant case, summarily denied\nrespondent\u2019s requests for appeal and for rehearing.In 2012, respondent filed a federal habeas\npetition in the Eastern District of Virginia pursuant to 28\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72254. A Magistrate Judge recommended dismissing\nthe petition, but the District Court disagreed and granted the\nwrit. The District Court explained that \u201cthere is no possibility\nthat fairminded jurists could disagree that the state court\u2019s\ndecision conflicts wit[h] the dictates ofGraham.\u201dLeBlancv.Mathena, 2015 WL 4042175, *18 (July 1,\n2015).A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the\nFourth Circuit affirmed, holding that the state trial court\u2019s\nruling was an unreasonable application ofGraham. 841\nF.\u00a03d, at 259\u2013260. In the panel majority\u2019s view, Virginia\u2019s\ngeriatric release program did not provide a meaningful opportunity\nfor juvenile nonhomicide offenders to obtain release based on\ndemonstrated maturity and rehabilitation.Judge Niemeyer dissented. He criticized the\nmajority for \u201cfail[ing] to respect, in any meaningful way, the\ndeference Congress requires federal courts to give state court\ndecisions on postconviction review.\u201dId., at 275.The Commonwealth of Virginia petitioned for\ncertiorari. The petition is now granted, and the judgment is\nreversed: The Virginia trial court did not unreasonably apply theGrahamrule.IIIn order for a state court\u2019s decision to be an\nunreason-able application of this Court\u2019s case law, the ruling must\nbe \u201cobjectively unreasonable, not merely wrong; even clear error\nwill not suffice.\u201dWoodsv.Donald, 575 U.\u00a0S.\n___, ___ (2015) (per curiam) (slip op., at 4) (internal\nquotation marks omitted). In other words, a litigant must \u201cshow\nthat the state court\u2019s ruling .\u00a0.\u00a0. was so lacking in\njustification that there was an error well understood and\ncomprehended in existing law beyond any possibility for fairminded\ndisagreement.\u201dIbid.(internal quotation marks omitted).\nThis is \u201cmeant to be\u201d a difficult standard to meet.Harringtonv.Richter, 562 U.\u00a0S. 86, 102 (2011)\n.The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit\nerred by failing to accord the state court\u2019s decision the deference\nowed under AEDPA.Grahamdid not decide that a geriatric\nrelease program like Virginia\u2019s failed to satisfy the Eighth\nAmendment because that question was not presented. And it was not\nobjectively unreasonable for the state court to conclude that,\nbecause the geriatric release program employed normal parole\nfactors, it satisfiedGraham\u2019s requirement that juveniles\nconvicted of a nonhomicide crime have a meaningful opportunity to\nreceive parole. The geriatric release program instructs Virginia\u2019s\nParole Board to consider factors like the \u201cindividual\u2019s history\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. and the individual\u2019s conduct .\u00a0.\u00a0. during\nincarceration,\u201d as well as the prisoner\u2019s \u201cinter-personal\nrelationships with staff and inmates\u201d and \u201c[c]hanges in attitude\ntoward self and others.\u201d See 841 F.\u00a03d, at 280\u2013281 (Niemeyer,\nJ., dissenting) (citing Virginia Parole Board Policy Manual 2\u20134\n(Oct. 2006)). Consideration of these factors could allow the Parole\nBoard to order a former juvenile offender\u2019s conditional release in\nlight of his or her \u201cdemonstrated maturity and rehabilitation.\u201dGraham, 560 U.\u00a0S., at 75. The state court thus did not\ndiverge so far fromGraham\u2019s dictates as to make it \u201cso\nobvious that .\u00a0.\u00a0. there could be no \u2018fairminded\ndisagreement\u2019\u00a0\u201d about whether the state court\u2019s ruling\nconflicts with this Court\u2019s case law.Whitev.Woodall, 572 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at\n11).\u201cPerhaps the logical next step from\u201dGrahamwould be to hold that a geriatric release program\ndoes not satisfy the Eighth Amendment, but \u201cperhaps not.\u201d 572\nU.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 11).\u201c[T]here are\nreasonable arguments on both sides.\u201dId.,at ___\u2013___ (slip\nop., at 11\u201312). With respect to petitioners, these include the\narguments discussed above.Supra,at 4. With regards to\nrespondent, these include the contentions that the Parole Board\u2019s\nsubstantial discretion to deny geriatric release deprives juvenile\nnonhomicide offenders a meaningful opportunity to seek parole and\nthat juveniles cannot seek geriatric release until they have spent\nat least four decades in prison.These arguments cannot be resolved on federal\nhabeas review. Because this case arises \u201conly in th[at] narrow\ncontext,\u201d the Court \u201cexpress[es] no view on the merits of the\nunderlying\u201d Eighth Amendment claim.Woods,supra,at\n___ (slip op., at 7) (internal quotation marks omitted). Nor does\nthe Court \u201csuggest or imply that the underlying issue, if presented\non direct review, would be insubstantial.\u201dMarshallv.Rodgers, 569 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2013) (per curiam)\n(slip op., at 7); accord,Woodall,supra, at ___\n(slip op., at 5). The Court today holds only that the Virginia\ntrial court\u2019s ruling, resting on the Virginia Supreme Court\u2019s\nearlier ruling inAngel, was not objectively unreasonable in\nlight of this Court\u2019s current case law.IIIA proper respect for AEDPA\u2019s high bar for\nhabeas relief avoids unnecessarily \u201cdisturb[ing] the State\u2019s\nsignificant interest in repose for concluded litigation, den[ying]\nsoci-ety the right to punish some admitted offenders, and\nin-trud[ing] on state sovereignty to a degree matched by few\nexercises of federal judicial authority.\u201dHarrington,supra, at 103 (internal quotation marks omitted). The\nfederalism interest implicated in AEDPA cases is of central\nrelevance in this case, for the Court of Appeals for the Fourth\nCircuit\u2019s holding created the potential for significant discord in\nthe Virginia sentencing process. Before today, Virginia courts were\npermitted to impose\u2014and required to affirm\u2014a sentence like\nrespondent\u2019s, while federal courts presented with the same fact\npattern were required to grant ha-beas relief. Reversing the Court\nof Appeals\u2019 decision in this case\u2014rather than waiting until a more\nsubstantial split of authority develops\u2014spares Virginia courts from\nhaving to confront this legal quagmire.For these reasons, the petition for certiorari\nand the motion for leave to proceedin forma pauperisare\ngranted, and the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.It is so ordered.",
