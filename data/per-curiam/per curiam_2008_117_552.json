ARAVE, WARDENv.MAXWELL\nHOFFMANon petition for writ of certiorari to the united\nstates court of appeals for the ninth circuitNo. 07\u2013110.\u2003Decided January 7, 2008Per Curiam.Respondent Maxwell Hoffman was\nconvicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death. SeeStatev.Hoffman, 123 Idaho 638, 851 P.\u00a02d\n934 (1993). Hoffman sought federal habeas relief on the grounds\nthat,interalia, his counsel had been\nineffective during both pretrial plea bargaining and the sentencing\nphase of his trial. The District Court, finding that Hoffman had\nreceived ineffective assistance of counsel during sentencing but\nnot during plea bargaining, granted Hoffman\u2019s federal habeas\npetition in part and ordered the State of Idaho to resentence him.\nCiv. Action No. 94\u20130200\u2013S\u2013BLW (Mar. 30, 2002), App. to Pet. for\nCert. 38, 65. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the\nDistrict Court\u2019s decision regarding ineffective assistance of\ncounsel during sentencing,* but reversed with respect to the\nineffective assistance claim during plea negotiations. 455\nF.\u00a03d 926, 942 (2006). The Ninth Circuit thus granted the\nwrit, ordering the District Court to direct the State either to\nrelease Hoffman or to \u201coffe[r] [him] a plea agreement with the\n\u2018same material terms\u2019 offered in the original plea agreement.\u201dId., at 943. The State sought, and we granted, certiorari.\n552 U. S. ___ (2007).Hoffman now abandons his claim that counsel\nwas ineffective during plea bargaining. See Respondent\u2019s Motion to\nVacate Decision Below and Dismiss the Cause as Moot. He \u201cno longer\nseeks or desires the relief ordered by the Court of Appeals with\nrespect to the plea offer.\u201dId., at 3. Rather, Hoffman now\n\u201cwishes to withdraw his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel\nin connection with plea bargaining\u201d and asks this Court to dismiss\nhis appeal with prejudice on that issue so that he may proceed with\nthe resentencing ordered by the District Court.Ibid.The State, in its response, notes that\nHoffman\u2019s requested relief is \u201cvirtually identical to the request\nmade by the state in its Petition for Certiorari.\u201d Response to\nRespondent\u2019s Motion to Vacate Decision Below and Dismiss the Cause\nas Moot, p. 3. The State therefore agrees that the instant motion\nto vacate and dismiss with prejudice moots Hoffman\u2019s claim of\nineffective assistance of counsel during plea negotiations and asks\nthat the motion be granted.We grant respondent\u2019s motion. Because his\nclaim for ineffective assistance of counsel during pretrial plea\nbargaining is moot, we vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals\nto the extent that it addressed that claim. The case is remanded to\nthe United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit with\ndirections that it instruct the United States District Court for\nthe District of Idaho to dismiss the relevant claim with prejudice.Deakinsv.Monaghan,484 U. S. 193, 200\u2013201\n(1988);United Statesv.Munsingwear, Inc.,340 U. S. 36,\n39\u201340 (1950).It is so ordered.*\u00a0The State initially cross-appealed the\nDistrict Court\u2019s grant of Hoffman\u2019s habeas petition for ineffective\nassistance of counsel at sentencing. The State, however,\nsubsequently withdrew that cross-appeal, leaving in place the\nDistrict Court\u2019s order granting habeas relief as to Hoffman\u2019s death\nsentence. 455 F.\u00a03d 926, 931 (CA9 2006).",
