All of their claims broadly\ncenter on the use of YouTube, which Google owns and operates, by\nISIS and ISIS supporters.The District Court dismissed plaintiffs\u2019\ncomplaint for failure to state a claim, though it offered\nplaintiffs leave to amend their complaint. Instead, plaintiffs\nstood on their complaint and appealed, and the Ninth Circuit\naffirmed in a consolidated opinion that also addressedTwitter,Inc.v.Taamneh, ___ U.\u00a0S. ___\n(2023). 2 F.\u00a04th 871 (2021). With respect to this case, the\nNinth Circuit held that most of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims were barred\nby \u00a7230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996, 110Stat. 137, 47\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7230(c)(1). The sole exceptions were plaintiffs\u2019\ndirect- and secondary-liability claims based on allegations that\nGoogle approved ISIS videos for advertisements and then shared\nproceeds with ISIS through YouTube\u2019s revenue-sharing system. The\nNinth Circuit held that these potential claims were not barred by\n\u00a7230, but that plaintiffs\u2019 allegations failed to state a viable\nclaim in any event.We granted certiorari to review the Ninth\nCircuit\u2019s application of \u00a7230. See 598 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2022).\nPlaintiffs did not seek review of the Ninth Circuit\u2019s holdings\nregarding their revenue-sharing claims. In light of those\nunchallenged holdings and our disposition ofTwitter, on\nwhich we also granted certiorari and in which we today reverse the\nNinth Circuit\u2019s judgment, it has become clear that plaintiffs\u2019\ncomplaint\u2014independent of \u00a7230\u2014states little if any claim for\nrelief. As plaintiffs concede, the allegations underlying their\nsecondary-liability claims are materially identical to those at\nissue inTwitter. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 58. Since we hold\nthat the complaint in that case fails to state a claim for aiding\nand abetting under \u00a72333(d)(2), it appears to follow that the\ncomplaint here likewise fails to state such a claim. And, in\ndiscussing plaintiffs\u2019 revenue-sharing claims, the Ninth Circuit\nheld that plaintiffs plausibly alleged neither that \u201cGoogle reached\nan agreement with ISIS,\u201d as required for conspiracy liability, nor\nthat Google\u2019s acts were \u201cintended to intimidate or coerce a\ncivilian population, or to influence or affect a government,\u201d as\nrequired for a direct-liability claim under \u00a72333(a). 2\nF.\u00a04th, at 901, 907. Perhaps for that reason, at oral\nargument, plaintiffs only suggested that they should receive leave\nto amend their complaint if we were to reverse and remand inTwitter. Tr. of Oral Arg. 58, 163.We need not resolve either the viability of\nplaintiffs\u2019 claims as a whole or whether plaintiffs should receive\nfurther leave to amend. Rather, we think it sufficient to\nacknowledge that much (if not all) of plaintiffs\u2019 complaint seems\nto fail under either our decision inTwitteror the Ninth\nCircuit\u2019s unchallenged holdings below. We therefore decline to\naddress the application of \u00a7230 to a complaint that appears to\nstate little, if any, plausible claim for relief. Instead, we\nvacate the judgment below and remand the case for the Ninth Circuit\nto consider plaintiffs\u2019 complaint in light of our decision inTwitter.It is so ordered.Notes1\u201cISIS\u201d is shorthand for\nthe Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. In some form or another, it\nhas been designated a Foreign Terrorist Organization since 2004;\nISIS has also been known as the Islamic State of Iraq and the\nLevant, al Qaeda in Iraq, and the al-Zarqawi Network.2Title 18\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72333(a) provides: \u201cAny national of the United\nStates injured in his or her person, property, or business by\nreason of an act of international terrorism, or his or her estate,\nsurvivors, or heirs, may sue therefor in any appropriate district\ncourt of the United States and shall recover threefold the damages\nhe or she sustains and the cost of the suit, including attorney\u2019s\nfees.\u201d Section 2333(d)(2) provides: \u201cIn an action under subsection\n(a) for an injury arising from an act of international terrorism\ncommitted, planned, or authorized by an organization that had been\ndesignated as a foreign terrorist organization under section 219 of\nthe Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. 1189), as\nof the date on which such act of international terrorism was\ncommitted, planned, or authorized, liability may be asserted as to\nany person who aids and abets, by knowingly providing substantial\nassistance, or who conspires with the person who committed such an\nact of international terrorism.\u201d",
