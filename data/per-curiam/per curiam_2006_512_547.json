WHITMAN, PETITIONERv.DEPARTMENT\nOF TRANSPORTATION et\u00a0al.on writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the ninth circuit[June 5, 2006]Per Curiam.Terry Whitman, the petitioner, is\nan employee of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and is\nsubject to the agency\u2019s drug and alcohol testing program. Without\nfirst seeking to pursue grievance procedures under his\ncollective-bargaining agreement, he filed suit in the United States\nDistrict Court for the District of Alaska, alleging the FAA tested\nhim in a nonrandom manner, in violation of his constitutional\nrights and 49 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a745104(8).The FAA has its own procedural framework for\nthe resolution of claims by its employees; and for this purpose it\nadopts certain sections of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978\n(CSRA), including Chapter 71 of Title 5, which sets forth the rules\nfor grievances. 49 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a740122(g)(2)(C). The District\nCourt held that, under the provisions of the CSRA, it was without\njurisdiction to consider the petitioner\u2019s claims. The Court of\nAppeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed, stating that because \u201c5 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a77121(a)(1), as amended in 1994, does not expressly\nconfer federal court jurisdiction over employment-related claims\ncovered by the negotiated grievance procedures of federal\nemployees\u2019 collective bargaining agreements,\u201d his claims are\nprecluded. 382 F.\u00a03d 938, 939 (2004). This Court granted\ncertiorari to review the judgment. 545 U. S. ___ (2005).The Court of Appeals was correct to say that 5\nU. S.\u00a0C. \u00a77121(a)(1) does not confer jurisdiction. Another\nstatute, however\u2014a very familiar one\u2014grants jurisdiction to the\nfederal courts over \u201call civil actions arising under the\nConstitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.\u201d 28 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a71331. The question, then, is not whether 5 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a77121 confers jurisdiction, but whether \u00a77121 (or the\nCSRA as a whole) removes the jurisdiction given to the federal\ncourts, seeVerizon Md. Inc.v.Public Serv. Comm\u2019n of\nMd.,535 U. S.\n635, 642 (2002) (holding that \u201ceven if [47 U. S.\u00a0C.]\n\u00a7252(e)(6) does notconferjurisdiction, it at least does\nnotdivestthe district courts of their authority under 28\nU. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71331 to review the Commission\u2019s order for compliance\nwith federal law\u201d), or otherwise precludes employees from pursuing\nremedies beyond those set out in the CSRA, cf.United\nStatesv.Fausto,484 U. S. 439, 443\u2013444\n(1988);Abbott Laboratoriesv.Gardner,387 U. S. 136, 140\n(1967) (\u201cThe question is phrased in terms of \u2018prohibition\u2019 rather\nthan \u2018authorization\u2019 because \u2026 judicial review of a final agency\naction by an aggrieved person will not be cut off unless there is\npersuasive reason to believe that such was the purpose of\nCongress\u201d).In deciding the question of jurisdiction and\npreclusion, the Court would be required first to ascertain where\nWhitman\u2019s claims fit within the statutory scheme, as the CSRA\nprovides different treatment for grievances depending on the nature\nof the claim. It may be, for example, that the FAA\u2019s actions, as\ndescribed by the petitioner, constitute a \u201cprohibited personnel\npractice.\u201d See 5 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a72302(b); 49 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a740122(g)(2)(A). Both the petitioner and the Government say they do\nnot, but because the ultimate question may be jurisdictional, this\nconcession ought not to be accepted out of hand. SeeWeinbergerv.Bentex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.,412 U. S. 645,\n652 (1973) (\u201cParties, of course, cannot confer jurisdiction; only\nCongress can do so\u201d). The Court of Appeals did not decide whether\nthe petitioner\u2019s allegations state a \u201cprohibited personnel\npractice.\u201d The proper course, then, is to remand for the Court of\nAppeals to address the matter, seeNational Collegiate Athletic\nAssn.v.Smith,525 U. S. 459, 470\n(1999), as well as the ultimate issue of preclusion. The various\nother issues raised before this Court, but not decided below, may\nalso be addressed on remand, including: whether the petitioner has\nchallenged final agency action; whether the petitioner has\nexhausted his administrative remedies; whether exhaustion is\nrequired given this statutory scheme and the Administrative\nProcedure Act, as interpreted inDarbyv.Cisneros,509 U. S. 137(1993);\nand whether the Government has forfeited its exhaustion-of-remedies\nargument. It may be that a decision on these questions can obviate\nthe need to decide a more difficult question of preclusion.The judgment of the Court of Appeals is\nvacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.Justice Alito took no part in the\nconsideration or decision of this case.",
