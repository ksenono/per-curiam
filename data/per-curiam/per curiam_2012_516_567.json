Code Ann. \u00a713\u2013 35\u2013227(1) (2011). The\nMontana Supreme Court rejected petitioners\u2019 claim that this statute\nviolates the First Amendment. 2011 MT 328, 363 Mont. 220, 271 P.3d\n1. InCitizens Unitedv.Federal Election Commission,\nthis Court struck down a similar federal law, holding that\n\u201cpolitical speech does not lose First Amendment protection simply\nbecause its source is a corporation.\u201d 558 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___\n(2010) (slip op., at 26) (internal quotation marks omitted). The\nquestion presented in this case is whether the holding ofCitizens Unitedapplies to the Montana state law. There can\nbe no serious doubt that it does. See U.\u00a0S. Const.,\nArt.\u00a0VI, cl. 2. Montana\u2019s arguments in support of the judgment\nbelow either were already rejected inCitizens United, or\nfail to meaningfully distinguish that case.The petition for\ncertiorari is granted. The judgment of the Supreme Court of Montana\nis reversed.It is so ordered.",
