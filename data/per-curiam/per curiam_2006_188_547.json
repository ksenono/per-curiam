The judgment is vacated, and the\ncase is remanded to the Fifth Circuit for further\nconsideration.The Fifth Circuit concluded that petitioner\u2019s\nprior conviction for simple possession of a controlled substance\nconstituted a \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d for purposes of United\nStates Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual \u00a74B1.1(a) (2003).\nThe term \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d is defined in pertinent\npart, however, as \u201can offense under federal or state law . . . that\nprohibits . . . the possession of a controlled substance (or a\ncounterfeit substance)with intent to manufacture, import,\nexport, distribute, or dispense.\u201d\u00a74B1.2(b) (emphasis added).\nAccordingly, the Fifth Circuit erred in treating petitioner\u2019s\nconviction for simple possession as a \u201ccontrolled substance\noffense.\u201d The Solicitor General acknowledges that the Fifth Circuit\nincorrectly ruled for the United States on this ground.
