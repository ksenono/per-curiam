S. ____ (2008)SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESJAMES ERIC MOOREv.UNITED STATESon petition for writ of certiorari to the united\nstates court of appeals for the eighth circuitNo. 07\u201310689.\u2003Decided October 14, 2008Per Curiam.James Eric Moore was convicted of\none count of possessing cocaine base with intent to distribute, a\nviolation of 21 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a7841(a)(1) and (b)(1). Given the\nquantity of crack cocaine, the presentence report calculated that\nMoore\u2019s sentencing range under the United States Sentencing\nGuidelines was 151 to 188 months. At sentencing, Moore asked the\nDistrict Court to impose a below-Guidelines sentence in light of\nour decision inUnited Statesv.Booker,543 U. S. 220(2005),\nand the Guidelines\u2019 disparate treatment of similar amounts of crack\nand powder cocaine.The District Court refused, saying:\u201cWith regard to the crack and powder cocaine\ndifference, that is the law. I\u2019m applying the law as it currently\nstands. If that is going to be changed, that is a congressional\nmatter. Congress is the one who looks at the guidelines and decides\nwhether or not they should be put in\u2014in force\u2026\u00a0. It isn\u2019t the\njudges. It\u2019s the lawmakers, and I have taken an oath to apply the\nlaw, and that\u2019s what I will do in this sentencing.\u201d App. C to Pet.\nfor Cert. 55\u201356.The District Court sentenced Moore to 188 months of\nimprisonment and six years of supervised release.Moore appealed, and the United States Court of\nAppeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed his conviction and\nsentence.United Statesv.Moore, 470 F.\u00a03d\n767 (2006). In response to his claim that the District Court should\nhave considered the crack/powder disparity, the Court of Appeals\nheld that \u201cthe district court was correct in concluding that\n\u2018neitherBookernor [18 U. S.\u00a0C.] \u00a73553(a) authorizes\ndistrict courts to reject\u2019 the powder cocaine to crack cocaine\nquantity ratio mandated by Congress and reflected in the\nGuidelines.\u201dId.,at 770 (quotingUnited Statesv.Spears, 469 F.\u00a03d 1166, 1176 (CA8 2006) (en\nbanc)). Moore filed a petition for certiorari with this Court. Pet.\nfor Cert. inMoorev.United States, No.\n06\u20139749.While Moore\u2019s certiorari petition was pending,\nthis Court issued its opinion inKimbroughv.United\nStates, 552 U. S. ___ (2007), concluding that a judge \u201cmay\nconsider the disparity between the Guidelines\u2019 treatment of crack\nand powder cocaine offenses\u201d when applying 18 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a73553(a), \u201ceven in a mine-run case.\u201dId.,at ___, ___\n(slip op., at 2, 21). We granted Moore\u2019s petition, vacated the\njudgment, and remanded the case to the Eighth Circuit for further\nconsideration in light ofKimbrough.Moorev.United States, 552 U. S. ___ (2008).On remand, without new briefing, the Eighth\nCircuit affirmed again. 518 F.\u00a03d 577 (2008). This time, the\nCourt of Appeals concluded that \u201c[a]s there was then no circuit\nauthority to the contrary, we presume the district court was aware\nthatBookergranted it discretion to vary downward based\nupon the impact of the crack cocaine guidelines on this defendant,\nbut elected not to exercise that discretion.\u201dId., at\n580.Proceedingpro se, Moore again\npetitioned for certiorari, arguing that the Eighth Circuit\u2019s new\ncharacterization of the transcript is wrong, and that it is \u201cclear\nthat the district court thought judges had no discre[t]ion to\nreject\u201d the Guidelines ratio. Pet. for Cert. 7. The United States\nagrees that the Eighth Circuit erred, see Brief for United States\n9, and so do we.When the District Court said that \u201c[i]t isn\u2019t\nthe judges\u201d but Congress that \u201clooks at the [G]uidelines and\ndecides whether or not they should be put \u2026 in force,\u201d the court\nshowed that it did not think it had the discretion later upheld byKimbrough. App. C to Pet. for Cert. 56. The Eighth\nCircuit\u2019s first decision recognized this, describing the District\nCourt as \u201cconcluding\u201d (correctly under circuit precedent) that it\nwas not \u201cauthorize[d] . . . to reject\u201d the crack/powder disparity.Moore,470 F.\u00a03d, at 770 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). In light of the District Court\u2019s comments at sentencing,\nthe Court of Appeals should have remanded the case to the District\nCourt for resentencing underKimbrough. We express no\nviews on how the District Court should exercise its discretion at\nresentencing.The petition for certiorari and the motion for\nleave to proceedinforma pauperisare granted.\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is\nremanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.",
