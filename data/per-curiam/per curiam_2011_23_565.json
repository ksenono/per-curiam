    "text": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESDAVID BOBBY, WARDEN v. ARCHIE DIXONon petition for writ of certiorari to the\nunited states court of appeals for the sixth circuitNo. 10\u20131540.\u2003Decided November 7, 2011Per Curiam.Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death\nPenalty Act, a state prisoner seeking a writ of habeas corpus from\na federal court \u201cmust show that the state court\u2019s ruling on the\nclaim being presented in federal court was so lacking in\njustification that there was an error well understood and\ncomprehended in existing law beyond any possibility for fairminded\ndisagreement.\u201d Harrington v. Richter, 562 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___\n(2011) (slip op., at 13). The Court of Appeals for the Sixth\nCircuit purported to identify three such grievous errors in the\nOhio Supreme Court\u2019s affirmance of respondent Archie Dixon\u2019s murder\nconviction. Because it is not clear that the Ohio Supreme Court\nerred at all, much less erred so transparently that no fairminded\njurist could agree with that court\u2019s decision, the Sixth Circuit\u2019s\njudgment must be reversed.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*Archie Dixon and Tim Hoffner murdered Chris\nHammer in order to steal his car. Dixon and Hoffner beat Hammer,\ntied him up, and buried him alive, pushing the struggling Hammer\ndown into his grave while they shoveled dirt on top of him. Dixon\nthen used Hammer\u2019s birth certificate and social security card to\nobtain a state identification card in Hammer\u2019s name. After using\nthat identification card to establish ownership of Hammer\u2019s car,\nDixon sold the vehicle for $2,800.Hammer\u2019s mother reported her son missing the day\nafter his murder. While investigating Hammer\u2019s disappearance,\npolice had various encounters with Dixon, three of which are\nrelevant here. On November 4, 1993, a police detective spoke with\nDixon at a local police station. It is undisputed that this was a\nchance encounter\u2014Dixon was apparently visiting the police station\nto retrieve his own car, which had been impounded for a traffic\nviolation. The detective issued Miranda warnings to Dixon and then\nasked to talk to him about Hammer\u2019s disappearance. See Miranda v.\nArizona,384 U.S.\n436(1966). Dixon declined to answer questions without his\nlawyer present and left the station.As their investigation continued, police\ndetermined that Dixon had sold Hammer\u2019s car and forged Hammer\u2019s\nsignature when cashing the check he received in that sale. Police\narrested Dixon for forgery on the morning of November 9. Beginning\nat 11:30 a.m. detectives intermittently interrogated Dixon over\nseveral hours, speaking with him for about 45 minutes total. Prior\nto the interrogation, the detectives had decided not to provide\nDixon with Miranda warnings for fear that Dixon would again refuse\nto speak with them.Dixon readily admitted to obtaining the\nidentification card in Hammer\u2019s name and signing Hammer\u2019s name on\nthe check, but said that Hammer had given him permission to sell\nthe car. Dixon claimed not to know where Hammer was, although he\nsaid he thought Hammer might have left for Tennessee. The\ndetectives challenged the plausibility of Dixon\u2019s tale and told\nDixon that Tim Hoffner was providing them more useful information.\nAt one point a detective told Dixon that \u201cnow is the time to say\u201d\nwhether he had any involvement in Hammer\u2019s disappearance because\n\u201cif Tim starts cutting a deal over there, this is kinda like, a bus\nleaving. The first one that gets on it is the only one that\u2019s gonna\nget on.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 183a. Dixon responded that, if\nHoffner knew anything about Hammer\u2019s disappearance, Hoffner had not\ntold him. Dixon insisted that he had told police everything he knew\nand that he had \u201c[n]othing whatsoever\u201d to do with Hammer\u2019s\ndisappearance. Id., at 186a. At approximately 3:30 p.m. the\ninterrogation concluded, and the detectives brought Dixon to a\ncorrectional facility where he was booked on a forgery charge.The same afternoon, Hoffner led police to\nHammer\u2019s grave. Hoffner claimed that Dixon had told him that Hammer\nwas buried there. After concluding their interview with Hoffner and\nreleasing him, the police had Dixon transported back to the police\nstation.Dixon arrived at the police station at about\n7:30 p.m. Prior to any police questioning, Dixon stated that he had\nheard the police had found a body and asked whether Hoffner was in\ncustody. The police told Dixon that Hoffner was not, at which point\nDixon said, \u201cI talked to my attorney, and I want to tell you what\nhappened.\u201d State v. Dixon, 101 Ohio St. 3d 328, 331,\n2004\u2013Ohio\u20131585, 805 N.E.2d 1042, 1050. The police read Dixon his\nMiranda rights, obtained a signed waiver of those rights, and spoke\nwith Dixon for about half an hour. At 8 p.m. the police, now using\na tape recorder, again advised Dixon of his Miranda rights. In a\ndetailed confession, Dixon admitted to murdering Hammer but\nattempted to pin the lion\u2019s share of the blame on Hoffner.At Dixon\u2019s trial, the Ohio trial court excluded\nboth Dixon\u2019s initial confession to forgery and his later confession\nto murder. The State took an interlocutory appeal. The State did\nnot dispute that Dixon\u2019s forgery confession was properly\nsuppressed, but argued that the murder confession was admissible\nbecause Dixon had received Miranda warnings prior to that\nconfession. The Ohio Court of Appeals agreed and allowed Dixon\u2019s\nmurder confession to be admitted as evidence. Dixon was convicted\nof murder, kidnaping, robbery, and forgery, and sentenced to\ndeath.The Ohio Supreme Court affirmed Dixon\u2019s\nconvictions and sentence. To analyze the admissibility of Dixon\u2019s\nmurder confession, the court applied Oregon v. Elstad,470 U.S.\n298(1985). The Ohio Supreme Court found that Dixon\u2019s\nconfession to murder after receiving Miranda warnings was\nadmissible because that confession and his prior, unwarned\nconfession to forgery were both voluntary. State v. Dixon, supra,\nat 332\u2013334, 805 N.\u00a0E. 2d, at 1050\u20131052; see Elstad, supra, at\n318 (\u201cWe hold today that a suspect who has once responded to\nunwarned yet uncoercive questioning is not thereby disabled from\nwaiving his rights and confessing after he has been given the\nrequisite Miranda warnings\u201d).Dixon then filed a petition for a writ of habeas\ncorpus under 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72254 in the U.\u00a0S. District\nCourt for the Northern District of Ohio. Dixon claimed, inter alia,\nthat the state court decisions allowing the admission of his murder\nconfession contravened clearly established federal law. The\nDistrict Court denied relief, but a divided panel of the Sixth\nCircuit reversed. Dixon v. Houk, 627 F.3d 553 (2010).The Sixth Circuit had authority to issue the\nwrit of habeas corpus only if the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s decision\n\u201cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of,\nclearly established Federal law,\u201d as set forth in this Court\u2019s\nholdings, or was \u201cbased on an unreasonable determination of the\nfacts\u201d in light of the state court record. \u00a72254(d); see\nHarrington, 562 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 10). The Sixth\nCircuit believed that the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s decision contained\nthree such egregious errors.First, according to the Sixth Circuit, the\nMiranda decision itself clearly established that police could not\nspeak to Dixon on November 9, because on November 4 Dixon had\nrefused to speak to police without his lawyer. That is plainly\nwrong. It is undisputed that Dixon was not in custody during his\nchance encounter with police on November 4. And this Court has\n\u201cnever held that a person can invoke his Miranda rights\nanticipatorily, in a context other than \u2018custodial\ninterrogation.\u2019\u00a0\u201d McNeil v. Wisconsin,501\nU.S. 171, 182, n.\u00a03 (1991); see also Montejo v. Louisiana,556 U.S.\n778, ___ (2009) (slip. op., at 16) (\u201cIf the defendant is not in\ncustody then [Miranda and its progeny] do not apply\u201d).Second, the Sixth Circuit held that police\nviolated the Fifth Amendment by urging Dixon to \u201ccut a deal\u201d before\nhis accomplice Hoffner did so. The Sixth Circuit cited no precedent\nof this Court\u2014or any court\u2014holding that this common police tactic\nis unconstitutional. Cf., e.g., Elstad, supra, at 317 (\u201c[T]he Court\nhas refused to find that a defendant who confesses, after being\nfalsely told that his codefendant has turned State\u2019s evidence, does\nso involuntarily\u201d). Because no holding of this Court suggests, much\nless clearly establishes, that police may not urge a suspect to\nconfess before another suspect does so, the Sixth Circuit had no\nauthority to issue the writ on this ground.Third, the Sixth Circuit held that the Ohio\nSupreme Court unreasonably applied this Court\u2019s precedent in\nElstad. In that case, a suspect who had not received Miranda\nwarnings confessed to burglary as police took him into custody.\nApproximately an hour later, after he had received Miranda\nwarnings, the suspect again confessed to the same burglary. This\nCourt held that the later, warned confession was admissible because\n\u201cthere is no warrant for presuming coercive effect where the\nsuspect\u2019s initial inculpatory statement, though technically in\nviolation of Miranda, was voluntary. The relevant inquiry is\nwhether, in fact, the second [warned] statement was also\nvoluntarily made.\u201d 470 U.\u00a0S., at 318 (footnote omitted).As the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s opinion explained,\nthe circumstances surrounding Dixon\u2019s interrogations demonstrate\nthat his statements were voluntary. During Dixon\u2019s first\ninterrogation, he received several breaks, was given water and\noffered food, and was not abused or threatened. He freely\nacknowledged that he had forged Hammer\u2019s name, even stating that\nthe police were \u201cwelcome\u201d to that information, and he had no\ndifficulty denying that he had anything to do with Hammer\u2019s\ndisappearance. State v. Dixon, 101 Ohio St. 3d, at 331, 805\nN.\u00a0E. 2d, at 1049. Prior to his second interrogation, Dixon\nmade an unsolicited declaration that he had spoken with his\nattorney and wanted to tell the police what had happened to Hammer.\nThen, before giving his taped confession, Dixon twice received\nMiranda warnings and signed a waiver-of-rights form which stated\nthat he was acting of his own free will.The Ohio Supreme Court recognized that Dixon\u2019s\nfirst in- terrogation involved \u201can intentional Miranda violation.\u201d\nThe court concluded, however, that \u201cas in Elstad, the breach of the\nMiranda procedures here involved no actual compulsion\u201d and thus\nthere was no reason to suppress Dixon\u2019s later, warned confession.\n101 Ohio St. 3d, at 334, 805 N.\u00a0E. 2d, at 1052 (citing Elstad,\nsupra, at 318).The Sixth Circuit disagreed, believing that\nDixon\u2019s confession was inadmissible under Elstad because it was the\nproduct of a \u201cdeliberate question-first, warn-later strategy.\u201d 627\nF. 3d, at 557. In so holding, the Sixth Circuit relied heavily on\nthis Court\u2019s decision in Missouri v. Seibert,542 U.S.\n600(2004). In Seibert, police employed a two-step strategy to\nreduce the effect of Miranda warnings: A detective exhaustively\nquestioned Seibert until she confessed to murder and then, after a\n15- to 20-minute break, gave Seibert Miranda warnings and led her\nto repeat her prior confession. 542 U.\u00a0S., at 604\u2013606, 616\n(plurality opinion). The Court held that Seibert\u2019s second\nconfession was inadmissible as evidence against her even though it\nwas preceded by a Miranda warning. A plurality of the Court\nreasoned that \u201c[u]pon hearing warnings only in the aftermath of\ninterrogation and just after mak- ing a confession, a suspect would\nhardly think he had a genuine right to remain silent, let alone\npersist in so believing once the police began to lead him over the\nsame ground again.\u201d 542 U.\u00a0S., at 613; see also id., at 615\n(detailing a \u201cseries of relevant facts that bear on whether Miranda\nwarnings delivered midstream could be effective enough to\naccomplish their object\u201d). Justice Kennedy concurred in the\njudgment, noting he \u201cwould apply a narrower test applicable only in\nthe infrequent case .\u00a0.\u00a0. in which the two-step\ninterrogation technique was used in a calculated way to undermine\nthe Miranda warning.\u201d Id., at 622.In this case, no two-step interrogation\ntechnique of the type that concerned the Court in Seibert\nundermined the Miranda warnings Dixon received. In Seibert, the\nsuspect\u2019s first, unwarned interrogation left \u201clittle, if anything,\nof incriminating potential left unsaid,\u201d making it \u201cunnatural\u201d not\nto \u201crepeat at the second stage what had been said before.\u201d 542\nU.\u00a0S., at 616\u2013617 (plurality opinion). But in this case Dixon\nsteadfastly maintained during his first, unwarned interrogation\nthat he had \u201c[n]othing whatso- ever\u201d to do with Hammer\u2019s\ndisappearance. App. to Pet. for Cert. 186a. Thus, unlike in\nSeibert, there is no concern here that police gave Dixon Miranda\nwarnings and then led him to repeat an earlier murder confession,\nbecause there was no earlier confession to repeat. Indeed, Dixon\ncontradicted his prior unwarned statements when he confessed to\nHammer\u2019s murder. Nor is there any evidence that police used Dixon\u2019s\nearlier admission to forgery to induce him to waive his right to\nsilence later: Dixon declared his desire to tell police what\nhappened to Hammer before the second interrogation session even\nbegan. As the Ohio Supreme Court reasonably concluded, there was\nsimply \u201cno nexus\u201d between Dixon\u2019s unwarned admission to forgery and\nhis later, warned confession to murder. 101 Ohio St. 3d, at 333,\n805 N.\u00a0E. 2d, at 1051.Moreover, in Seibert the Court was concerned\nthat the Miranda warnings did not \u201ceffectively advise the suspect\nthat he had a real choice about giving an admissible statement\u201d\nbecause the unwarned and warned interrogations blended into one\n\u201ccontinuum.\u201d 542 U.\u00a0S., at 612, 617. Given all the\ncircumstances of this case, that is not so here. Four hours passed\nbetween Dixon\u2019s unwarned interrogation and his receipt of Miranda\nrights, during which time he traveled from the police station to a\nseparate jail and back again; claimed to have spoken to his lawyer;\nand learned that police were talking to his accomplice and had\nfound Hammer\u2019s body. Things had changed. Under Seibert, this\nsignificant break in time and dramatic change in circumstances\ncreated \u201ca new and distinct experience,\u201d ensuring that Dixon\u2019s\nprior, unwarned interrogation did not undermine the effectiveness\nof the Miranda warnings he received before confessing to Hammer\u2019s\nmurder. 542 U.\u00a0S., at 615; see also id., at 622 (Kennedy, J.,\nconcurring in judgment) (\u201cFor example, a substantial break in time\nand circumstances between the prewarning statement and the Miranda\nwarning may suffice in most circumstances, as it allows the accused\nto distinguish the two contexts and appreciate that the\ninterrogation has taken a new turn\u201d).The admission of Dixon\u2019s murder confession was\nconsistent with this Court\u2019s precedents: Dixon received Mi- randa\nwarnings before confessing to Hammer\u2019s murder; the effectiveness of\nthose warnings was not impaired by the sort of \u201ctwo-step\ninterrogation technique\u201d condemned in Seibert; and there is no\nevidence that any of Dixon\u2019s statements was the product of actual\ncoercion. That does not excuse the detectives\u2019 decision not to give\nDixon Miranda warnings before his first interrogation. But the Ohio\ncourts recognized that failure and imposed the appropriate remedy:\nexclusion of Dixon\u2019s forgery confession and the attendant\nstatements given without the benefit of Miranda warnings. Because\nno precedent of this Court required Ohio to do more, the Sixth\nCircuit was without authority to overturn the reasoned judgment of\nthe State\u2019s highest court.The petition for a writ of certiorari and\nrespondent\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis are granted. The\njudgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit is reversed,\nand the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with\nthis opinion.It is so ordered.",
