PARDUS\net\u00a0al.on petition for writ of certiorari to the united\nstates court of appeals for the tenth circuitNo. 06\u20137317.\u2003Decided June 4, 2007Per Curiam.Imprisoned by the State of\nColorado and alleging violations of his Eighth and Fourteenth\nAmendment protections against cruel and unusual punishment, William\nErickson, the petitioner in this Court, filed suit against prison\nofficials in the United States District Court for the District of\nColorado. He alleged that a liver condition resulting from\nhepatitis C required a treatment program that officials had\ncommenced but then wrongfully terminated, with life-threatening\nconsequences. Deeming these allegations, and others to be noted, to\nbe \u201cconclusory,\u201d the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit\naffirmed the District Court\u2019s dismissal of petitioner\u2019s complaint.\n198 Fed. Appx. 694, 698 (2006). The holding departs in so stark a\nmanner from the pleading standard mandated by the Federal Rules of\nCivil Procedure that we grant review. We vacate the court\u2019s\njudgment and remand the case for further consideration.Petitioner was incarcerated in the Limon\nCorrectional Facility in Limon, Colorado, where respondents Barry\nPardus and Dr. Anita Bloor were working as prison officials. After\nDr. Bloor removed petitioner from the hepatitis C treatment he had\nbeen receiving, petitioner sued under 42 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71983,\ncomplaining,inter alia, that Dr. Bloor had violated his\nEighth Amendment rights by demonstrating deliberate indifference to\nhis serious medical needs. See,e.g.,Estellev.Gamble,429\nU. S. 97, 104\u2013105 (1976) (\u201c[D]eliberate indifference to serious\nmedical needs of prisoners constitutes the unnecessary and wanton\ninfliction of pain . . . proscribed by the Eighth Amendment,\u201d and\nthis includes \u201cindifference . . . manifested by prison doctors in\ntheir response to the prisoner\u2019s needs or by prison guards in\nintentionally denying or delaying access to medical care or\nintentionally interfering with the treatment once prescribed\u201d\n(footnotes and internal quotation marks omitted)); see alsoHellingv.McKinney,509 U. S. 25, 35\u201337\n(1993).Petitioner based his claim on the following\nallegations, which we assume to be true for purposes of review\nhere: Officials at Colorado\u2019s Department of Corrections\n(Department) diagnosed petitioner as requiring treatment for\nhepatitis C. After completing the necessary classes and otherwise\ncomplying with the protocols set forth by the Department,\npetitioner began treatment for the disease. The treatment, which\nwould take a year to complete, involved weekly self-injections of\nmedication by use of a syringe. Soon after petitioner began this\ntreatment, prison officials were unable to account for one of the\nsyringes made available to petitioner (and other prisoners) for\nmedical purposes. Upon searching, they found it in a communal trash\ncan, modified in a manner suggestive of use for injection of\nillegal drugs. Prisoner Complaint in Civ. Action No.\n05\u2013CV\u201300405\u2013LTB\u2013MJW (D. Colo.), p. 3 (hereinafter Petitioner\u2019s\nComplaint).Prison officials, disbelieving petitioner\u2019s\nclaim not to have taken the syringe, found that his conduct\nconstituted a violation of the Colorado Code of Penal Discipline\nfor possession of drug paraphernalia. Letter from Anthony A.\nDeCesaro to William Erickson (Sept. 30, 2004), attached to\nPetitioner\u2019s Complaint. This conduct, according to the officials,\nled to the \u201creasonable inference\u201d that petitioner had intended to\nuse drugs, so the officials removed petitioner from his hepatitis C\ntreatment.Ibid. \u201cThe successful treatment of Hepatitis C\nis incumbent upon the individual remaining drug and alcohol free to\ngive the liver a better chance of recovery,\u201d they indicated,ibid., an explanation they later offered to defend against\npetitioner\u2019s allegations of cruel and unusual punishment, see\nDefendants\u2019 Motion to Dismiss in Civ. Action No.\n05\u2013CV\u201300405\u2013LTB\u2013MJW, p. 10. Assuming that a person in the course of\nthis treatment takes illicit drugs, the prison\u2019s protocol mandates\na waiting period of one year followed by a mandatory drug education\nclass lasting six months. Brief in Opposition 4. Petitioner\ntherefore could face a delay of some 18 months before he would be\nable to restart treatment.In his complaint petitioner alleged Dr. Bloor\nhad \u201cremoved [him] from [his] hepatitis C treatment\u201d in violation\nof department protocol, \u201cthus endangering [his] life.\u201d Petitioner\u2019s\nComplaint 2. Petitioner attached to the complaint certain grievance\nforms. In these he claimed, among other things, he was suffering\nfrom \u201ccontinued damage to [his] liver\u201d as a result of the\nnontreatment. Colorado Dept. of Corrections Offender Grievance Form\n(June 30, 2004). The complaint requested relief including damages\nand an injunction requiring that the Department treat petitioner\nfor hepatitis C \u201cunder the standards of the treatment [protocol]\nestablished by [the Department].\u201d Petitioner\u2019s\nComplaint\u00a08.Three months after filing his complaint, and\nwell before the District Court entered a judgment against him,\npetitioner filed a Motion for Expedited Review Due to Imminent\nDanger, in Civ. Action No. 05\u2013B\u2013405 (MJW) (D.\u00a0Colo.).\nIndicating it was \u201cundisputed\u201d that he had hepatitis C, that he met\nthe Department\u2019s standards for treatment of the disease, and that\n\u201cfurtherance of this disease can cause irreversible damage to [his]\nliver and possible death,\u201d petitioner alleged that \u201cnumerous\ninmates\u201d in his prison community had died of the disease and that\nhe was \u201cin imminent danger\u201d himself \u201cdue to [the Department\u2019s]\nrefusal to treat him.\u201dIbid. He had identified similar\nallegations in an earlier filing, explaining that \u201chis liver is\nsuffering irreversible damage\u201d due to the decision to remove him\nfrom treatment and that he \u201cwill suffer irreparable damage if his\ndisease goes untreated.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s Objections to the Magistrate\u2019s\nRecommendations in Civ. Action No. 05\u2013CV\u201300405\u2013LTB\u2013MJW, p. 3.Respondents answered these filings with a\nmotion to dismiss. The Magistrate Judge recommended, as relevant,\nthat the District Court dismiss the complaint on the ground it\nfailed to allege Dr. Bloor\u2019s actions had caused petitioner\n\u201csubstantial harm.\u201d Recommendation on Defendants\u2019 Motion To\nDismiss, p. 12. The District Court issued a short order indicating\nits agreement with the Magistrate Judge and dismissing the\ncomplaint.The Court of Appeals affirmed. It quoted\nextensively from the Magistrate Judge\u2019s discussion of \u201csubstantial\nharm\u201d before holding that petitioner had made \u201conly conclusory\nallegations to the effect that he has suffered a cognizable\nindependent harm as a result of his removal from the [hepatitis C]\ntreatment program.\u201d 198 Fed. Appx., at698.\nAcknowledging decisions by courts that have found Eighth Amendment\nviolations when delays in medical treatment have involved\n\u201clife-threatening situations and instances in which it is apparent\nthat delay would exacerbate the prisoner\u2019s medical problems\u201d (and\nthat have, moreover, indicated the Eighth Amendment \u201cprotects\nagainst future harm to an inmate\u201d),id., at 697 (internal\nquotation marks omitted), the court nevertheless found petitioner\u2019s\ncomplaint deficient: Petitioner had, according to the court, failed\nto \u201callege that as a result of the discontinuance of the treatment\nitself shortly after it began or the interruption of treatment for\napproximately eighteen months he suffered any harm, let alone\nsubstantial harm, [other] than what he already faced from the\nHepatitis C itself,\u201did., at 698 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Having reached this conclusion, the court saw no need to\naddress whether the complaint alleged facts sufficient to support a\nfinding that Dr. Bloor had made her decisions with a \u201csufficiently\nculpable state of mind.\u201dId., at 697, 698 (internal\nquotation marks omitted).It may in the final analysis be\nshown that the District Court was correct to grant respondents\u2019\nmotion to dismiss. That is not the issue here, however. It was\nerror for the Court of Appeals to conclude that the allegations in\nquestion, concerning harm caused petitioner by the termination of\nhis medication, were too conclusory to establish for pleading\npurposes that petitioner had suffered \u201ca cognizable independent\nharm\u201d as a result of his removal from the hepatitis C treatment\nprogram.Id., at 698.Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n8(a)(2) requires only \u201ca short and plain statement of the claim\nshowing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\u201d Specific facts are\nnot necessary; the statement need only \u201c \u2018give the defendant fair\nnotice of what the . . . claim is and the grounds upon which it\nrests.\u2019 \u201dBell Atlantic Corp.v.Twombly, 550 U.\nS. ___, ___ (2007) (slip op., at 7\u20138) (quotingConleyv.Gibson,355\nU. S. 41, 47 (1957)). In addition, when ruling on a defendant\u2019s\nmotion to dismiss, a judge must accept as true all of the factual\nallegations contained in the complaint.Bell Atlantic\nCorp.,supra, at ___ (slip op., at 8\u20139) (citingSwierkiewiczv.Sorema N. A.,534 U. S. 506, 508, n. 1\n(2002);Neitzkev.Williams,490 U. S. 319, 327\n(1989);Scheuerv.Rhodes,416 U. S. 232, 236\n(1974)).The complaint stated that Dr.\nBloor\u2019s decision to remove petitioner from his prescribed hepatitis\nC medication was \u201cendangering [his] life.\u201d Petitioner\u2019s Complaint\n2. It alleged this medication was withheld \u201cshortly after\u201d\npetitioner had commenced a treatment program that would take one\nyear, that he was \u201cstill in need of treatment for this disease,\u201d\nand that the prison officials were in the meantime refusing to\nprovide treatment.Id., at 3, 4. This alone was enough to\nsatisfy Rule 8(a)(2). Petitioner, in addition, bolstered his claim\nby making more specific allegations in documents attached to the\ncomplaint and in later filings.The Court of Appeals\u2019 departure\nfrom the liberal pleading standards set forth by Rule 8(a)(2) is\neven more pronounced in this particular case because petitioner has\nbeen proceeding, from the litigation\u2019s outset, without counsel. A\ndocument filedpro seis \u201cto be liberally construed,\u201dEstelle, 429 U. S., at 106, and \u201capro secomplaint, however inartfully pleaded, must be held to less\nstringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers,\u201dibid.(internal quotation marks omitted). Cf. Fed. Rule\nCiv. Proc. 8(f) (\u201cAll pleadings shall be so construed as to do\nsubstantial justice\u201d).Whether petitioner\u2019s complaint\nis sufficient in all respects is a matter yet to be determined, for\nrespondents raised multiple arguments in their motion to dismiss.\nIn particular, the proper application of the controlling legal\nprinciples to the facts is yet to be determined. The case cannot,\nhowever, be dismissed on the ground that petitioner\u2019s allegations\nof harm were too conclusory to put these matters in issue.\nCertiorari and leave to proceedin forma pauperisare\ngranted, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the\ncase is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this\nopinion.It is so ordered.Justice Scalia\nwould deny the petition for a writ of certiorari.",
