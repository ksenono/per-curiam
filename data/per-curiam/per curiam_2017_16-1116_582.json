    "text": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESCHARLOTTE JENKINS, WARDENv.PERCY\nHUTTONon petition for writ of certiorari to the\nunited states court of appeals for the sixth circuitNo. 16\u20131116.\u2003Decided June 19, 2017Per Curiam.Respondent Percy Hutton accused two friends,\nDerek Mitchell and Samuel Simmons Jr., of stealing a sewing\nmachine, in which he had hidden $750. Mitchell and Simmons denied\nthe accusation, but Hutton remained suspicious. On the night of\nSeptember 16, 1985, he lured the pair into his car and, after\npointing a gun at each, drove them around town in search of the\nmachine. By night\u2019s end, Hutton had recovered his sewing machine,\nSimmons was in the hospital with two gunshot wounds to the head,\nand Mitchell was nowhere to be found. Simmons survived, but\nMitchell was found dead a few weeks later, also having been shot\ntwice.More than 30 years ago, an Ohio jury convicted\nHutton of aggravated murder, attempted murder, and kidnaping. In\nconnection with the aggravated murder conviction, the jury made two\nadditional findings: that Hutton engaged in \u201ca course of conduct\ninvolving the .\u00a0.\u00a0. attempt to kill two or more persons,\u201d\nand that Hutton murdered Mitchell while \u201ccommitting, attempting to\ncommit, or fleeing immediately after .\u00a0.\u00a0. kidnapping,\u201d\nOhio Rev. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a72929.04(A)(5), (7) (Lexis 1982). Because of\nthese \u201caggravating circumstances,\u201d Ohio law required that Hutton be\nsentenced to \u201cdeath, life imprisonment without parole, [or] life\nimprisonment with parole eligibility after\u201d no fewer than 20 years\nin prison. \u00a72929.03(C)(2).Several days after rendering its verdict, the\njury reconvened for the penalty phase of the trial. The State\nargued for the death penalty. In opposition, Hutton gave an unsworn\nstatement professing his innocence and presented evidence about his\nbackground and psychological pro-file. When the presentations\nconcluded, the trial court instructed the jury that it could\nrecommend a death sentence only if it unanimously found that the\nState had \u201cprove[d] beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating\ncircumstances, of which the Defendant was found guilty,\noutweigh[ed] the [mitigating factors].\u201dStatev.Hutton, 100 Ohio St. 3d 176, 185, 2003-Ohio-5607, 797\nN.\u00a0E. 2d 948, 958; see Ohio Rev. Code Ann. \u00a72929.03(D)(2). The\njury deliberated and recommended death. The trial court accepted\nthe recommendation after also finding, \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt,\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. that the aggravating circumstances .\u00a0.\u00a0.\noutweigh[ed] the mitigating factors.\u201d \u00a72929.03(D)(3).The Ohio Court of Appeals and the Ohio Supreme\nCourt affirmed Hutton\u2019s death sentence. In doing so, both concluded\nthat \u201cthe evidence support[ed] the finding of the aggravating\ncircumstances.\u201d \u00a72929.05(A); seeHutton, 100 Ohio St. 3d, at\n187, 797 N.\u00a0E. 2d, at 961;Statev.Hutton, 72\nOhio App. 3d 348, 350, 594 N.\u00a0E. 2d 692, 694 (1995). The\ncourts also \u201cindependently weigh[ed] all of the facts\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. to determine whether the aggravating circumstances\n[Hutton] was found guilty of committing outweigh[ed] the mitigating\nfactors.\u201d Ohio Rev. Code Ann. \u00a72929.05(A). Both agreed with the\njury and the trial court that \u201caggravating circumstances\noutweigh[ed] the mitigating factors,\u201d and that a death sentence was\nwarranted.Hutton, 100 Ohio St. 3d, at 191, 797 N.\u00a0E.\n2d, at 963\u2013964; seeHutton, 72 Ohio App. 3d, at 352, 594\nN.\u00a0E. 2d, at 695.The case before this Court concerns Hutton\u2019s\nsubsequent petition for federal habeas relief. In 2005, Hutton\nfiled such a petition pursuant to 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72254,\narguing that the trial court violated his due process rights during\nthe penalty phase of his trial. According to Hutton, the court gave\nthe jurors insufficient guidance because it failed to tell them\nthat, when weighing aggravating and mitigating factors, they could\nconsider only the two aggravating factors they had found during the\nguilt phase. Hutton, however, had not objected to the trial court\u2019s\ninstruction or raised this argument on direct appeal, and the\nDistrict Court on federal habeas concluded that his due process\nclaim was procedurally defaulted.Huttonv.Mitchell,\n2013 WL 2476333, *64 (ND Ohio, June 7, 2013); seeStatev.Hutton, 53 Ohio St. 3d 36, 39, n.\u00a01, 559 N.\u00a0E. 2d\n432, 437\u2013438, n. 1 (1990) (declining to address trial court\u2019s\ninstructions because Hutton \u201cspecifically declined to object\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. at trial, and ha[d] not raised or briefed the\nissue\u201d on appeal).The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth\nCircuit reversed. The court concluded that, notwithstanding the\nprocedural default, it could \u201creach the merits\u201d of Hutton\u2019s claim\nto \u201cavoid a fundamental miscarriage of justice.\u201dHuttonv.Mitchell, 839 F. 3d 486, 498 (2016) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). The Sixth Circuit began its analysis withSawyerv.Whitley, 505 U.\u00a0S. 333 (1992) . In\nthat decision, this Court established that a habeas petitioner may\nobtain review of a defaulted claim upon \u201cshow[ing] by clear and\nconvincing evidence that, but for a constitutional error, no\nreasonable jury would have found [him] eligible for the death\npenalty under the applicable state law.\u201dId.,at 336.Hutton had not argued that this exception to\ndefault applied to his case. Nonetheless, the Sixth Circuit held\nthat the exception justified reviewing his claim. The court gave\ntwo reasons: First, Hutton was not eligible to receive a death\nsentence because \u201cthe jury had not made the necessary finding of\nthe existence of aggravating circumstances.\u201d 839 F.\u00a03d, at\n498\u2013499. And second, since the trial court \u201cgave the jury no\nguidance as to what to con-sider as aggravating circumstances\u201d when\nweighing aggravating and mitigating factors, the record did not\nshow that the jury\u2019s death recommendation \u201cwas actually based on a\nreview of any valid aggravating circumstances.\u201dId.,at 500.\nOn the merits, the court concluded that the trial court violated\nHutton\u2019s constitutional rights by giving an erroneous jury\ninstruction. Judge Rogers dissented on the ground that Hutton could\nnot overcome the procedural default.The Sixth Circuit was wrong to reach the merits\nof Hutton\u2019s claim. The court\u2019s first reason for excusing default\nwas that \u201cthe jury had not [found] the existence of aggravating\ncircumstances.\u201dId.,at 498\u2013499. But it had, at the guilt\nphase of Hutton\u2019s trial. As Judge Rogers pointed out, \u201cthe jury\nfound two such factors\u201d\u2014engaging in a course of conduct designed to\nkill multiple people and committing kidnaping\u2014\u201cin the process of\nconvicting Hutton .\u00a0.\u00a0. of aggravated murder.\u201dId.,at 511. Each of those findings \u201crendered Hutton\neligible for the death penalty.\u201dIbid.Hutton has not argued\nthat the trial court improperly instructed the jury about\naggravating circumstances at the guilt phase. Nor did the Sixth\nCircuit identify any such error. Instead, the instruction that\nHutton contends is incorrect, and that the Sixth Circuit analyzed,\nwas given at thepenaltyphase of trial. That penalty phase\ninstruction plainly had no effect on the jury\u2019s decision\u2014delivered\nafter theguiltphase and pursuant to an unchallenged\ninstruction\u2014that aggravating circumstances were present when Hutton\nmurdered Mitchell.The Sixth Circuit\u2019s second reason for reaching\nthe merits rests on a legal error. UnderSawyer, a court may\nreview a procedurally defaulted claim if, \u201cbut for a\nconstitutional error, no reasonable jury would have found the\npetitioner eligible for the death penalty.\u201d 505 U.\u00a0S., at 336\n(emphasis added). Here, the alleged error was the trial court\u2019s\nfailure to specify that, when weighing aggravating and mitigating\nfactors, the jury could consider only the aggravating circumstances\nit found at the guilt phase. Assuming such an error can provide a\nbasis for excusing default, the Sixth Circuit should have\nconsidered the following: Whether, givenproperinstructions\nabout the two aggravating circumstances, a reasonable jury could\nhave decided that those aggravating circumstances outweighed the\nmitigating circumstances.But the court did not ask that question.\nInstead, it considered whether, given the (alleged)improperinstructions, the jury might have been relying on invalid\naggravating circumstances when it recommended a death sentence. See\n839 F.\u00a03d, at 500 (explaining that, because the trial court\ngave \u201cno guidance as to what to consider as aggravating\ncircumstances,\u201d the court could not determine whether the death\nrecommendation \u201cwas actually based on a review of any valid\naggravating circumstances\u201d). The court, in other words, considered\nwhether the alleged error might have affected the jury\u2019s verdict,\nnot whether a properly instructed jury could have recommended\ndeath. That approach, which would justify excusing default whenever\nan instructional error could have been relevant to a jury\u2019s\ndecision, is incompatible withSawyer.Neither Hutton nor the Sixth Circuit has\n\u201cshow[n] by clear and convincing evidence that\u201d\u2014if properly\nin-structed\u2014\u201cno reasonable juror would have\u201d concluded that the\naggravating circumstances in Hutton\u2019s case outweigh the mitigating\ncircumstances.Sawyer, 505 U. S., at 336. In fact, the trial\ncourt, Ohio Court of Appeals, and Ohio Supreme Court each\nindependently weighed those factors and concluded that the death\npenalty was justified. On the facts of this case, the Sixth Circuit\nwas wrong to hold that it could review Hutton\u2019s claim under the\nmiscarriage of justice exception to procedural default.The petition for certiorari and motion for leave\nto proceedin forma pauperisare granted, the judgment of\nthe United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit is\nreversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.",
