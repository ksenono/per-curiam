    "text": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESDEBORAH K. JOHNSON, WARDENv.DONNA KAY\nLEEon petition for writ of certiorari to the\nunited states court of appeals for the ninth circuitNo. 15\u2013789.\u2003Decided May 31, 2016Per Curiam.Federal habeas courts generally refuse to hear\nclaims \u201cdefaulted .\u00a0.\u00a0. in state court pursuant to an\nindependent and adequate state procedural rule.\u201dColemanv.Thompson,501 U.S.\n722, 750 (1991). State rules count as \u201cadequate\u201d if they are\n\u201cfirmly established and regularly followed.\u201dWalkerv.Martin,562 U.S.\n307, 316 (2011) (internal quotation marks omitted). Like all\nStates, California requires criminal defendants to raise available\nclaims on direct appeal. Under the so-called \u201cDixonbar,\u201d a\ndefendant procedurally defaults a claim raised for the first time\non state collateral review if he could have raised it earlier on\ndirect appeal. SeeIn\u00a0re Dixon,41 Cal. 2d 756, 759, 264 P.2d 513, 514 (1953). Yet, in this\ncase, the Ninth Circuit held that theDixonbar is\ninadequate to bar fed- eral habeas review. Because California\u2019s\nprocedural bar is longstanding, oft-cited, and shared by habeas\ncourts across the Nation, this Court now summarily reverses the\nNinth Circuit\u2019s judgment.IRespondent Donna Kay Lee and her boyfriend\nPaul Carasi stabbed to death Carasi\u2019s mother and his ex-girlfriend.\nA California jury convicted the pair of two counts each of\nfirst-degree murder. Carasi received a death sentence, and Lee\nreceived a sentence of life without the possibility of parole. In\nJune 1999, Lee unsuccessfully raised four claims on direct appeal.\nAfter the California appellate courts affirmed, Lee skipped state\npostconviction review and filed the federal habeas petition at\nissue. See 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72254(a). The petition raised\nmostly new claims that Lee failed to raise on direct appeal.\nBecause Lee had not exhausted available state-court remedies,\nhowever, the District Court temporarily stayed federal proceedings\nto allow Lee to pursue her new claims in a state habeas petition.\nThe California Supreme Court denied Lee\u2019s petition in a summary\norder citingDixon.Having exhausted state remedies, Lee returned to\nfederal court to litigate her federal habeas petition. The District\nCourt dismissed her new claims as procedurally defaulted. Then, for\nthe first time on appeal, Lee challenged theDixonbar\u2019s\nadequacy. In her brief, Lee presented a small sample of the\nCalifornia Supreme Court\u2019s state habeas denials on a single day\nabout six months after her default. Lee claimed that out of the 210\nsummary denials on December 21, 1999, the court failed to citeDixonin 9 cases where it should have been applied. The\ncourt instead denied the nine petitions without any citation at\nall. In Lee\u2019s view, these missing citations proved that the\nCalifornia courts inconsistently applied theDixonbar.\nWithout evaluating this evidence, the Ninth Circuit reversed and\nremanded \u201cto permit the Warden to submit evidence to the contrary,\nand for consideration by the district court in the first instance.\u201dLeev.Jacquez, 406 Fed.\u00a0Appx. 148, 150\n(2010).On remand, the warden submitted a study\nanalyzing more than 4,700 summary habeas denials during a nearly\n2-year period around the time of Lee\u2019s procedural default. From\nAugust 1998 to June 2000, the study showed, the California Supreme\nCourt citedDixonin approximately 12% of all denials\u2014more\nthan 500 times. In light of this evidence, the District Court held\nthat theDixonbar is adequate.The Ninth Circuit again reversed.Leev.Jacquez, 788 F.3d 1124 (2015). Lee\u2019s 1-day sample proved theDixonbar\u2019s inadequacy, the court held, because the \u201cfailure\nto citeDixonwhereDixonapplies\n.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0 reflects [its] irregular application.\u201d 788\nF.\u00a03d, at 1130. The general 12% citation rate proved nothing,\nthe court reasoned, because the warden \u201cd[id] not purport to show\nto how many cases theDixonbarshouldhave been\napplied.\u201dId.,at 1133. In the Ninth Circuit\u2019s view, without\nthis \u201cbaseline number\u201d the warden\u2019s 2-year study was \u201centirely\ninsufficient\u201d to proveDixon\u2019s adequacy. 788 F.\u00a03d, at\n1133.IIThe Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision profoundly\nmisapprehends what makes a state procedural bar \u201cadequate.\u201d That\nquestion is a matter of federal law.Leev.Kemna,534 U.S.\n362, 375 (2002). \u201cTo qualify as an \u2018adequate\u2019 procedural\nground,\u201d capable of barring federal habeas review, \u201ca state rule\nmust be \u2018firmly established and regularly followed.\u2019\u00a0\u201dMartin,supra, at 316 (quotingBeardv.Kindler,558 U.S.\n53, 60 (2009)).California\u2019sDixonbar satisfies both\nadequacy criteria. It is \u201cfirmly established\u201d because, decades\nbefore Lee\u2019s June 1999 procedural default, the California Supreme\nCourt warned defendants in plain terms that, absent \u201cspecial\ncircumstances,\u201d habeas \u201cwill not lie where the claimed errors could\nhave been, but were not, raised upon a timely appeal from a\njudgment of conviction.\u201dDixon,supra, at 759, 264\nP.\u00a02d, at 514. And the California Supreme Court eliminated any\narguable ambiguity surrounding this bar by reaffirmingDixonin two cases decided before Lee\u2019s default. SeeIn\u00a0re\nHarris,5 Cal. 4th 813, 825, n.\u00a03, 829\u2013841,855 P.2d 391, 395, n.\u00a03, 398\u2013407 (1993);In\u00a0re\nRobbins,18 Cal. 4th 770, 814\u2013815, and n.\u00a034,959 P.2d 311, 340\u2013341, and n.\u00a034 (1998).The California Supreme Court\u2019s repeatedDixoncitations also prove that the bar is \u201cregularly\nfollowed.\u201dMartinrecently held that another California\nprocedural bar\u2014a rule requiring prisoners to file state habeas\npetitions promptly\u2014met that requirement because \u201c[e]ach year, the\nCalifornia Supreme Court summarily denies hundreds of habeas\npetitions by citing\u201d the timeliness rule. 562 U.\u00a0S., at 318.\nThe same goes forDixon. Nine purportedly missingDixoncitations from Lee\u2019s 1-day sample of summary orders\nhardly support an inference of inconsistency. SeeDuggerv.Adams,489 U.S.\n401, 410, n.\u00a06 (1989) (holding that the Florida Supreme\nCourt applied its similar procedural bar \u201cconsistently and\nregularly\u201d despite \u201caddress[ing] the merits in several cases\nraising [new] claims on postconviction review\u201d). Indeed, all nine\norders in that sample were denials. None ignored theDixonbar tograntrelief, so there is no sign of\ninconsistency.Nor is California\u2019s rule unique. Federal and\nstate ha- beas courts across the country follow the same rule asDixon. \u201cThe general rule in federal habeas cases is that a\ndefendant who fails to raise a claim on direct appeal is barred\nfrom raising the claim on collateral review.\u201dSanchez-Llamasv.Oregon, 548 U.S. 331, 350\u2013351 (2006). Likewise, state\npostconviction remedies generally \u201cmay not be used to litigate\nclaims which were or could have been raised at trial or on direct\nappeal.\u201d 1 D. Wilkes, State Postconviction Remedies and Relief\nHandbook \u00a71:2, p.\u00a03 (2015\u20132016 ed.). It appears that every\nState shares this procedural bar in some form. See Brief for State\nof Alabama et al. asAmici Curiae1, n.\u00a02 (collecting\ncitations). For such well-established and ubiquitous rules, it\ntakes more than a few outliers to show inadequacy. Federal habeas\ncourts must not lightly \u201cdisregard state procedural rules that are\nsubstantially similar to those to which we give full force in our\nown courts.\u201dKindler, 558 U.\u00a0S., at 62. And it would be\n\u201c[e]ven stranger to do so with respect to rules in place in nearly\nevery State.\u201dIbid.Nothing suggests, moreover, that\nCalifornia courts apply theDixonbar in a way that\ndisfavors federal claims. The Court therefore holds that it\nqualifies as adequate to bar federal habeas review.IIIThe Ninth Circuit\u2019s contrary reasoning is\nunpersuasive and inconsistent with this Court\u2019s precedents.\nApplying theDixonbar may be a \u201cstraightforward\u201d or\n\u201cmechanica[l]\u201d task for state courts. 788 F.\u00a03d, at 1130. But\nsimplicity does not imply that missing citations reflect\nstate-court inconsistency. To begin with, since theDixonbar has several exceptions, seeRobbins,supra, at\n814\u2013815, and n.\u00a034, 959 P.\u00a02d, at 340\u2013341, and\nn.\u00a034, the California Supreme Court can hardly be faulted for\nfailing to citeDixonwhenever a petitioner raises a claim\nthat he could have raised on direct appeal.More importantly, California courts need not\naddress procedural default before reaching the merits, so the\npurportedly missing citations show nothing. Cf.Bellv.Cone,543 U.S.\n447, 451, n.\u00a03 (2005) (per curiam) (declining\nto address the warden\u2019s procedural-default argument);Lambrixv.Singletary,520 U.S.\n518, 525 (1997) (explaining that \u201c[\u00a0j]udicial economy\nmight counsel\u201d bypassing a procedural-default question if the\nmerits \u201cwere easily resolvable against the habeas petitioner\u201d).\nOrdinarily, \u201cprocedural default .\u00a0.\u00a0. is not a\njurisdictional matter.\u201dTrestv.Cain,522 U.S.\n87, 89 (1997). As a result, the appropriate order of analysis\nfor each case remains within the state courts\u2019 discretion. Such\ndiscretion will often lead to \u201cseeming inconsistencies.\u201dMartin, 562 U.\u00a0S., at 320, and n.\u00a07. But that\nsuperficial tension does not make a procedural bar inadequate. \u201c[A]\nstate procedural bar may count as an adequate and independent\nground for denying a federal habeas petition even if the state\ncourt had discretion to reach the merits despite the default.\u201dId., at 311; seeKindler,supra, at 60\u201361.The Ninth Circuit\u2019s attempt to get aroundMartinandKindlerfails. The Court of Appeals\ndistinguished those cases on the ground that California\u2019sDixonbar is \u201cman- datory\u201d rather than discretionary because\nit involves a discretion-free general rule, notwithstanding\nexceptions that might involve discretion. 788 F.\u00a03d, at 1130.\nThe Court assumes, without deciding, that this description is\naccurate and theDixonbar\u2019s exceptions leave some room for\ndiscretion. Even so, there is little difference between discretion\nexercised through an otherwise adequate procedural bar\u2019s exceptions\nand discretion that is a part of the bar itself. In any event, the\nNinth Circuit\u2019s reasoning ignores the state courts\u2019 discretion to\nassume, without deciding, that a claim is not procedurally\ndefaulted and instead hold that the claim lacks merit.The Ninth Circuit was accordingly wrong to\ndismiss the 500-plus summary denials citingDixonsimply\nbecause they do not reveal which cases potentially implicate the\nbar. 788 F.\u00a03d, at 1133.Martinalready rejected this\nprecise reasoning. There, the habeas petitioner unsuccessfully\nargued that \u201c[u]se of summary denials makes it impossible to tell\nwhy the California Supreme Court decides some delayed petitions on\nthe merits and rejects others as untimely.\u201d 562 U.\u00a0S., at 319\n(internal quotation marks omitted). So too here, \u201c[w]e see no\nreason to reject California\u2019s [procedural] bar simply because a\ncourt may opt to bypass the e see no reason to reject California\u2019s\n[procedural] bar simply because a court may opt to bypass the\n[Dixon] assessment and summarily dismiss a petition on the\nmerits, if that is the easier path.\u201dIbid.By treating every missing citation as a sign of\ninconsistency, the Court of Appeals \u201cpose[d] an unnecessary\ndilemma\u201d for California.Kindler, 558 U.\u00a0S., at 61. The\ncourt forced the State to choose between the \u201cfinality of [its]\njudgments\u201d and a burdensome opinion-writing requirement.Ibid.; seeMartin,supra, at 312\u2013313 (noting\nthat the California Supreme Court \u201crules on a staggering number of\nhabeas petitions each year\u201d);Harringtonv.Richter,562 U.S.\n86, 99 (2011) (discussing the advantages of summary\ndispositions). \u201c[F]ederal courts have no authority,\u201d however, \u201cto\nimpose mandatory opinion-writing standards on state courts\u201d as the\nprice of federal respect for their procedural rules.Johnsonv.Williams, 568 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at\n9). The Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision is thus fundamentally at odds with\nthe \u201cfederalism and comity concerns that motivate the adequate\nstate ground doctrine in the habeas context.\u201dKindler,supra, at 62.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\u201cA State\u2019s procedural rules are of vital\nimportance to the orderly administration of its criminal courts;\nwhen a federal court permits them to be readily evaded, it\nundermines the criminal justice system.\u201dLambrix,supra, at 525. Here, the Ninth Circuit permitted California\nprisoners to evade a well-established procedural bar that is\nadequate to bar federal habeas review. The petition for a writ of\ncertiorari and respondent\u2019s motion to proceedin forma\npauperisare granted. The judgment of the Court of Appeals for\nthe Ninth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.",
