AZAR, II, SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND\nHUMAN SERVICES, et\u00a0al.v.ROCHELLE GARZA, as guardian\nad\u00a0litem to unaccompanied minor J.\u00a0D.on petition for writ of certiorari to the\nunited states court of appeals for the district of columbia\ncircuitNo. 17\u2013654.\u2003Decided June 4, 2018Per Curiam.Jane Doe, a minor, was eight weeks pregnant when\nshe unlawfully crossed the border into the United States. She was\ndetained and placed into the custody of the Office of Refugee\nResettlement (ORR), part of the Department of Health and Human\nServices. ORR placed her in a feder- ally funded shelter in Texas.\nAfter an initial medical exam- ination, Doe requested an abortion.\nBut ORR did not allow Doe to go to an abortion clinic. Absent\n\u201cemergency medical situations,\u201d ORR policy prohibits shelter\npersonnel from \u201ctaking any action that facilitates an abortion\nwithout direction and approval from the Director of ORR.\u201d\nPlaintiff\u2019s Application for TRO and Motion for Preliminary\nInjunction inGarzav.Hargan, No. 17\u2013cv\u20132122 (D DC),\nDkt. No. 3\u20135, p.\u00a02 (decl. of Brigitte Amiri, Exh. A).\nAccording to the Government, a minor may \u201cle[ave] government\ncustody by seeking voluntary departure, or by working with the\ngovernment to identify a suitable sponsor who could take custody of\nher in the United States.\u201d Pet. for Cert. 18; see also 8\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71229c; 8 CFR \u00a7\u00a7236.3, 1240.26 (2018).Respondent Rochelle Garza, Doe\u2019s guardian\nad\u00a0litem, filed a putative class action on behalf of Doe and\n\u201call other pregnant unaccompanied minors in ORR custody\u201d\nchallenging the constitutionality of ORR\u2019s policy. Complaint inGarzav.Hargan, No. 17\u2013cv\u20132122 (D DC), Dkt. No. 1,\np.\u00a011. On October 18, 2017, the District Court issued a\ntemporary restraining order allowing Doe to obtain an abortion\nimmediately. On October 19, Doe attended preabortion counseling,\nrequired by Texas law to occur at least 24 hours in advance with\nthe same doctor who performs the abortion. The clinic she visited\ntypically rotated physicians on a weekly basis.The next day, a panel of the Court of Appeals\nfor the District of Columbia Circuit vacated the relevant portions\nof the temporary restraining order. Noting that the Government had\nassumed for purposes of this case that Doe had a constitutional\nright to an abortion, the panel concluded that ORR\u2019s policy was not\nan \u201cundue burden,\u201dPlanned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa.v.Casey, 505 U.\u00a0S. 833, 876 (1992) (plurality\nopinion).Four days later, on October 24, the Court of\nAppeals, sitting en banc, vacated the panel order and remanded the\ncase to the District Court.Garzav.Hargan, 874\nF.\u00a03d 735, 735\u2013736 (CADC 2017). The same day, Garza sought an\namended restraining order. Garza\u2019s lawyers asked the District Court\nto order the Government to make Doe available \u201cin order to obtain\nthe counseling required by state law and to obtain the abortion\nprocedure.\u201d Pet. for Cert. 12 (emphasis deleted). The District\nCourt agreed and ordered the Government to act accordingly. Doe\u2019s\nrepresentatives scheduled an appointment for the next morning and\narranged for Doe to be transported to the clinic on October 25 at\n7:30 a.m.The Government planned to ask this Court for\nemer- gency review of the en banc order. Believing the abortion\nwould not take place until October 26 after Doe had repeated the\nstate-required counseling with a new doctor, the Government\ninformed opposing counsel and this Court that it would file a stay\napplication early on the morning of October 25. The details are\ndisputed, but sometime over the course of the night both the time\nand nature of the appointment were changed. The doctor who had\nperformed Doe\u2019s earlier counseling was available to perform the\nabortion after all and the 7:30 a.m. appointment was moved to 4:15\na.m. At 10 a.m., Garza\u2019s lawyers informed the Government that Doe\n\u201chad the abortion this morning.\u201dId., at 15 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). The abortion rendered the relevant claim\nmoot, so the Government did not file its emergency stay\napplication. Instead, the Government filed this petition for\ncertiorari.When \u201ca civil case from a court in the federal\nsystem .\u00a0.\u00a0. has become moot while on its way here,\u201d this\nCourt\u2019s \u201cestablished practice\u201d is \u201cto reverse or vacate the\njudgment below and remand with a direction to dismiss.\u201dUnited\nStatesv.Munsingwear, Inc., 340 U.\u00a0S. 36, 39\n(1950). Because this practice is rooted in equity, the decision\nwhether to vacate turns on \u201cthe conditions and circumstances of the\nparticular case.\u201dUnited Statesv.Hamburg-Amerikanische\nPacketfahrt-Actien Gesellschaft, 239 U.\u00a0S. 466, 478\n(1916). One clear example where \u201c[v]acatur is in order\u201d is \u201cwhen\nmootness occurs through .\u00a0.\u00a0. the \u2018unilateral action of\nthe party who prevailed in the lower court.\u2019\u00a0\u201dArizonans\nfor Official Englishv.Arizona, 520 U.\u00a0S. 43,\n71\u201372 (1997) (quotingU.\u00a0S. Bancorp Mortgage Co.v.Bonner Mall Partnership, 513 U.\u00a0S. 18, 23 (1994)).\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018It would certainly be a strange doctrine that would permit\na plaintiff to obtain a favorable judgment, take voluntary action\nthat moots the dispute, and then retain the benefit of the\njudgment.\u2019\u00a0\u201d 520 U.\u00a0S., at 75 (alterations omitted).The litigation over Doe\u2019s temporary restraining\norder falls squarely within the Court\u2019s established practice. Doe\u2019s\nindividual claim for injunctive relief\u2014the only claim addressed by\nthe D.\u00a0C. Circuit\u2014became moot after the abortion. It is\nundisputed that Garza and her lawyers prevailed in the D.\u00a0C.\nCircuit, took voluntary, unilateral action to have Doe undergo an\nabortion sooner than initially expected, and thus retained the\nbenefit of that favorable judgment. And although not every moot\ncase will warrant vacatur, the fact that the relevant claim here\nbecame moot before certiorari does not limit this Court\u2019s\ndiscretion. See,e.g., LG Electronics, Inc.v.InterDigital Communications, LLC, 572 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2014)\n(after the certiorari petition was filed, respondents withdrew the\ncomplaint they filed with the International Trade Commission);United Statesv.Samish Indian Nation, 568 U.\u00a0S.\n936 (2012) (after the certiorari petition was filed, respondent\nvoluntarily dismissed its claim in the Court of Federal Claims);Eisai Co.v.Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc., 564\nU.\u00a0S. 1001 (2011) (before the certiorari petition was filed,\nrespondent\u2019s competitor began selling the drug at issue, which was\nthe relief that respondent had sought);Indiana State Police\nPension Trustv.Chrysler LLC, 558 U.\u00a0S. 1087\n(2009) (before the certiorari petition was filed, respondent\ncompleted a court-approved sale of assets, which mooted the\nappeal). The unique circumstances of this case and the balance of\nequities weigh in favor of vacatur.The Government also suggests that opposing\ncounsel made \u201cwhat appear to be material misrepresentations and\nomissions\u201d that were \u201cdesigned to thwart this Court\u2019s review.\u201d Pet.\nfor Cert. 26. Respondent says this suggestion is \u201cbaseless.\u201d Brief\nin Opposition 23. The Court takes allegations like those the\nGovernment makes here seriously, for ethical rules are necessary to\nthe maintenance of a culture of civility and mutual trust within\nthe legal profession. On the one hand, all attorneys must remain\naware of the principle that zealous advocacy does not displace\ntheir obligations as officers of the court. Especially in\nfast-paced, emergency proceedings like those at issue here, it is\ncritical that lawyers and courts alike be able to rely on one\nanother\u2019s representations. On the other hand, lawyers also have\nethical obligations to their clients and not all communication\nbreakdowns constitute misconduct. The Court need not delve into the\nfactual disputes raised by the parties in order to answer theMunsingwearquestion here.The petition for a writ of certiorari is\ngranted. The Court vacates the en banc order and remands the case\nto the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia\nCircuit with instructions to direct the District Court to dismiss\nthe relevant individual claim for injunctive relief as moot.
