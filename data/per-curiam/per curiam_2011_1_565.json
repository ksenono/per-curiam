    "text": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESJAVIER CAVAZOS, ACTING WARDENv.SHIRLEY REE SMITHon petition for writ of certiorari to the\nunited states court of appeals for the ninth circuitNo. 10\u20131115.\u2003Decided October 31, 2011Per Curiam.The opinion of the Court inJacksonv.Virginia,443 U.S.\n307(1979), makes clear that it is the responsibility of the\njury\u2014not the court\u2014to decide what conclusions should be drawn from\nevidence admitted at trial. A reviewing court may set aside the\njury\u2019s verdict on the ground of insufficient evidence only if no\nrational trier of fact could have agreed with the jury. What is\nmore, a federal court may not overturn a state court decision\nrejecting a suf-ficiency of the evidence challenge simply because\nthe fed-eral court disagrees with the state court. The federal\ncourt instead may do so only if the state court decision was\n\u201cobjectively unreasonable.\u201dRenicov.Lett, 559\nU.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 5) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).Because rational people can sometimes disagree,\nthe inevitable consequence of this settled law is that judges will\nsometimes encounter convictions that they believe to be mistaken,\nbut that they must nonetheless uphold. The Court of Appeals in this\ncase substituted its judgment for that of a California jury on the\nquestion whether the prosecution\u2019s or the defense\u2019s expert\nwitnesses more persuasively explained the cause of a death. For\nthis reason, certiorari is granted and the judgment of the Court of\nAppeals is reversed.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*This case concerns the death of 7-week-old\nEtzel Glass. On November 29, 1996, Etzel\u2019s mother, Tomeka, put\nEtzel to sleep on a sofa before going to sleep herself in another\nroom. Respondent Shirley Ree Smith\u2014Tomeka\u2019s mother\u2014slept on the\nfloor next to Etzel. Several hours later, Smith ran into Tomeka\u2019s\nroom, holding Etzel, who was limp, and told her that \u201c[s]omething\n[was] wrong with Etzel.\u201d Tr. 416. By the time emergency officials\narrived, Etzel was not breathing and had no heartbeat. Smith\nreported that she thought Etzel had fallen off the sofa. The\nofficials\u2019 efforts to resuscitate Etzel failed.Doctors initially attributed Etzel\u2019s death to\nsudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), the customary diagnosis when\nan infant shows no outward signs of trauma. But after an autopsy,\nthe coroner concluded that the cause of death was instead shaken\nbaby syndrome (SBS). When a social worker informed Smith of that\nfinding, Smith told her that Etzel had not responded to her touch\nwhile sleeping, so she had picked him up and given him \u201ca little\nshake, a jostle\u201d to wake him.Id., at 842. According to the\nsocial worker, Smith then said something to the effect of, \u201cOh, my\nGod. Did I do it? Did I do it? Oh, my God.\u201dId., at 847\n(internal quotation marks omitted). In an interview with the police\na few days later, Smith said that she had shaken Etzel, but then\nshe corrected herself and said that she had twisted him to try to\nelicit a reaction. Smith was arrested and charged with assault on a\nchild resulting in death. See Cal. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7273ab (West\n2008) (\u201cAny person who, having the care or custody of a child who\nis under eight years of age, assaults the child by means of force\nthat to a reasonable person would be likely to produce great bodily\ninjury, resulting in the child\u2019s death, shall be punished by\nimprisonment .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d).At trial, the jury heard seven days of expert\nmedical testimony on the cause of Etzel\u2019s death. The prosecution\noffered three experts, each of whom attested that Etzel\u2019s death was\nthe result of SBS\u2014not SIDS, as the defense contended. The first\nexpert, Dr. Eugene Carpenter, was the medical examiner for the Los\nAngeles County Coroner who had supervised Etzel\u2019s autopsy. Dr.\nCarpenter is board certified in forensic, anatomic, and clinical\npathol-ogy. He testified that Etzel\u2019s autopsy revealed recent\nhem-orrhages in the brain, and he opined that the bleeding and\nother features of Etzel\u2019s pathology, including a bruise and\nabrasion on the lower back of the baby\u2019s head, were consistent with\nviolent shaking. Dr. Carpenter identified two means by which\nshaking can result in a baby\u2019s death: The first is that the shaking\ncauses blood vessels in the brain to tear, creating a pool of blood\nthat pushes the brain downward into the spinal canal, resulting in\ndeath but little direct damage to the brain. The second is that the\nshaking itself is sufficiently severe that the brain directly tears\nin vital areas, causing death with very little bleeding. Dr.\nCarpenter testified that Etzel\u2019s injuries were consistent with the\nlatter pathology. He also explained that the injuries could not be\nattributed to either a fall from the sofa or the administration of\ncardiopulmonary resuscitation. Nor, according to Dr. Carpenter, was\nit possible that Etzel perished from SIDS, given the signs of\ninternal trauma. Dr. Carpenter did testify, however, that while SBS\nvictims often suffer retinal hemorrhaging, Etzel\u2019s autopsy revealed\nno such injury.The prosecution\u2019s second expert, Dr. Stephanie\nErlich, was the associate deputy medical examiner who actually\nperformed Etzel\u2019s autopsy. She is board certified in anatomic\npathology and neuropathology. She corroborated Dr. Carpenter\u2019s\ntestimony about the autopsy findings, and added that a followup\nneuropathological examination of Etzel\u2019s brain confirmed the\nexistence of recent hemorrhaging. Noting only a minimal amount of\nnew blood in Etzel\u2019s brain, she testified that the cause of death\nwas direct trauma to the brainstem. On cross-examination, she\nagreed with defense counsel that retinal hemorrhaging (absent in\nEtzel\u2019s case) is present in 75 to 80 percent of SBS cases.The third prosecution expert, Dr. David\nChadwick, is board certified in pediatrics and the author of\narticles on childhood death by abusive trauma. He testified that\nEtzel\u2019s injuries were consistent with SBS and that old trauma could\nnot have been the cause of the child\u2019s death.The defense called two experts to dispute these\nconclusions. The first, pathologist Dr. Richard Siegler, testified\nthat Etzel died from brain trauma, but that it was not the result\nof SBS, given the lack of retinal hemorrhaging. He admitted on\ncross-examination, however, that an absence of retinal hemorrhaging\ndoes not exclude a finding of SBS. He also acknowledged that he did\nnot believe the cause of Etzel\u2019s death was SIDS. According to Dr.\nSiegler, Etzel died from old trauma, an opinion he reached on the\nbasis of studying photographs of the neuropathological\nexamination.The other defense expert, pediatric neurologist\nDr. William Goldie, testified that Etzel\u2019s deathwasdue to\nSIDS. He noted that Etzel was born with jaundice, a heart murmur,\nand low birth weight\u2014making him more susceptible to SIDS. Dr.\nGoldie testified that pathologists had not been able to determine\nthe cause of Etzel\u2019s death and that the bleeding could be\nattributed to the resuscitation efforts.The jury found Smith guilty. Concluding that the\njury \u201ccarefully weighed\u201d the \u201ctremendous amount of evidence\u201d\nsupporting the verdict, Tr. 1649, the trial judge denied Smith\u2019s\nmotion for a new trial and sentenced her to an indeterminate term\nof 15 years to life in prison.On direct review, Smith contended that the\nevidence was not sufficient to establish that Etzel died from SBS.\nAfter thoroughly reviewing the competing medical testimony, the\nCalifornia Court of Appeal rejected this claim, concluding:\u201cThe expert opinion evidence we have\nsummarized was conflicting. It was for the jury to resolve the\nconflicts. The credited evidence was substantial and sufficient to\nsupport the jury\u2019s conclusions that Etzel died from shaken baby\nsyndrome. The conviction is supported by substantial evidence.\u201dPeoplev.Smith, No. B118869 (Feb. 10, 2000), App. K\nto Pet. for Cert. 86.The California Supreme Court denied review. App.\nJ,id., at 74.Smith then filed this petition for a writ of\nhabeas corpus with the United States District Court for the Central\nDistrict of California, renewing her claim that the evidence was\ninsufficient to prove that Etzel died of stocktickerSBS. Under the\nAntiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA),\n110Stat. 1214, that court had no power to afford relief unless\nSmith could show either that the California Court of Appeal\u2019s\ndecision affirming the conviction \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an\nunreasonable application of,\u201d clearly established federal law as\nreflected in the holdings of this Court\u2019s cases, 28\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72254(d)(1), or that it \u201cwas based on an\nunreasonable determination of the facts\u201d in light of the state\ncourt record, \u00a72254(d)(2).Harringtonv.Richter, 562\nU.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at\u00a010).The Magistrate Judge to whom the case was\nassigned issued a report acknowledging that \u201c[t]his is not the\ntypical shaken baby case\u201d and that the evidence against Smith\n\u201craises many questions.\u201d App. I to Pet. for Cert. 65. But the\nMagistrate Judge nevertheless concluded that the evidence was\n\u201cclearly sufficient to support a conviction.\u201dIbid.The\nDistrict Court adopted the Magistrate Judge\u2019s report and denied the\npetition. App. G,id., at 52.On appeal, the Ninth Circuit reversed with\ninstructions to grant the writ.Smithv.Mitchell,437 F.3d 884(2006). Despite the plentitude of expert testimony\nin the trial record concluding that sudden shearing or tearing of\nthe brainstem was the cause of Etzel\u2019s death, the Ninth Circuit\ndetermined that there was \u201cno evidence to permit an expert\nconclusion one way or the other\u201d on that question because there was\n\u201cno physical evidence of .\u00a0.\u00a0. tearing or shearing, and\nno other evidence supporting death by violent shaking.\u201dId.,\nat 890. The court said that the State\u2019s experts \u201creached [their]\nconclusion becausethere was no evidence in the brain itself of\nthe cause of death.\u201dIbid.(emphasis in original). The\ncourt concluded that because \u201c[a]bsence of evidence cannot\nconstitute proof beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201dibid., the\nCalifornia Court of Appeal had \u201cunreasonably applied\u201d this Court\u2019s\nopinion inJacksonv.Virginiain upholding Smith\u2019s\nconviction, 437 F.\u00a03d, at 890.That conclusion was plainly wrong.Jacksonsays that evidence is sufficient to support a\nconviction so long as \u201cafter viewing the evidence in the light most\nfavorable to the prosecution,anyrational trier of fact\ncould have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a\nreasonable doubt.\u201d 443 U.\u00a0S., at 319. It also unambiguously\ninstructs that a reviewing court \u201cfaced with a record of historical\nfacts that supports conflicting inferences must presume\u2014even if it\ndoes not affirmatively appear in the record\u2014that the trier of fact\nresolved any such conflicts in favor of the prosecution, and must\ndefer to that resolution.\u201dId., at 326. When the deference\nto state court decisions required by \u00a72254(d) is applied to the\nstate court\u2019s already deferential review, seeRenico, 559\nU.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 11), there can be no doubt of the\nNinth Circuit\u2019s error below.The jury was presented with competing views of\nhow Etzel died. It was made aware of the various experts\u2019\nqualifications and their familiarity with both the subject of SBS\nand the physical condition of Etzel\u2019s body. It observed the\nattorneys for each party cross-examine the experts and elicit\nconcessions from them. The State\u2019s experts, whom the jury was\nentitled to believe, opined that the physical evidence was\nconsistent with, and best explained by, death from sudden tearing\nof the brainstem caused by shaking. The Ninth Circuit\u2019s assertion\nthat these experts \u201creached [their] conclusion because there was no\nevidence in the brain itself of the cause of death\u201d is simply\nfalse. Therewas\u201cevidence in the brain itself.\u201d The autopsy\nrevealed indications of recent trauma to Etzel\u2019s brain, such as\nsubdural and subarachnoid hemorrhaging, hemorrhaging around the\noptic nerves, and the presence of a blood clot between the brain\u2019s\nhemispheres. The autopsy also revealed a bruise and abrasion on the\nlower back of Etzel\u2019s head. These affirmative indications of trauma\nformed the basis of the experts\u2019 opinion that Etzel died from\nshaking so severe that his brainstem tore.Defense counsel made certain that the jury\nunderstood that the prosecution\u2019s experts were unable to identify\nthe precise point of tearing itself. But as Judge Bea noted in his\ndissent from the Ninth Circuit\u2019s denial of rehearing en banc, the\nexperts explained why the location of the tear was undetectable:\n\u201cEtzel\u2019s death happened so quickly that the effects of the trauma\ndid not have time to develop.\u201dSmithv.Mitchell,453\nF.3d 1203, 1207 (2006). According to the prosecutions\u2019 experts,\nthere was simply no opportunity for swelling to occur around the\nbrainstem before Etzel died.In light of the evidence presented at trial, the\nNinth Circuit plainly erred in concluding that the jury\u2019s ver- dict\nwas irrational, let alone that it was unreasonable for the\nCalifornia Court of Appeal to think otherwise. See \u00a72254(d). Doubts\nabout whether Smith is in fact guilty are understandable. But it is\nnot the job of this Court, and was not that of the Ninth Circuit,\nto decide whether the State\u2019s theory was correct. The jury decided\nthat question, and its decision is supported by the\nrecord.[1]It is said that Smith, who already has served\nyears in prison, has been punished enough, and that she poses no\ndanger to society. These or other considerations perhaps would be\ngrounds to seek clemency, a prerogative granted to executive\nauthorities to help ensure that justice is tempered by mercy. It is\nnot clear to the Court whether this process has been invoked, or,\nif so, what its course has been. It is not for the Judicial Branch\nto determine the standards for this discretion. If the clemency\npower is exercised in either too generous or too stingy a way, that\ncalls for political correctives, not judicial intervention.The decision below cannot be allowed to stand.\nThis Court vacated and remanded this judgment twice before, calling\nthe panel\u2019s attention to this Court\u2019s opinions highlighting the\nnecessity of deference to state courts in \u00a72254(d) habeas cases.\nEach time the panel persisted in its course, reinstating its\njudgment without seriously confronting the significance of the\ncases called to its attention. SeePatrickv.Smith,\n550 country-regionU.\u00a0S. 915 (vacating and remanding in light\nofCareyv.Musladin, 549 country-regionU.\u00a0S. 70\n(2006)), reinstated on remand, 508 F.3d 1256 (2007)(per\u00a0curiam); 558 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2010) (vacating and\nremanding in light ofMcDanielv.Brown, 558\nplacecountry-regionU.\u00a0S. ___ (2010)(per curiam)),\nreinstated on remandsub\u00a0nom.Smithv.Mitchell, 624 F.3d 1235 (2010)(per\u00a0curiam). Its\nrefusal to do so necessitates this Court\u2019s action today.The petition for a writ of certiorari and\nrespondent\u2019s motion to proceedin forma pauperisare\ngranted. The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit\nis reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.Notes1The dissent\u2019s review of\nthe evidence presented to the jury over seven days is precisely the\nsort of reweighing of facts that is precluded byJacksonv.Virginia,443 U.S.\n307, 324 (1979), and precisely the sort of second-guessing of a\nstate court decision applyingJacksonthat is precluded by\nAEDPA, \u00a72254(d). The dissent\u2019s views on how \u201cadamantly\u201d experts\nwould testify today as opposed to at the time of trial,post, at 6 (opinion of Ginsburg, J.), are of course pure\nspeculation, as would be any views on how a jury would react to\nless adamant testimony.",
