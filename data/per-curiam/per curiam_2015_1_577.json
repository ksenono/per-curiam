    "text": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESMARYLAND, PETITIONERv.JAMES KULBICKIon petition for writ of certiorari to the court of appeals of\nmarylandNo. 14\u2013848.\u2003Decided October 5, 2015Per Curiam.A criminal defendant \u201cshall enjoy the right .\u00a0.\u00a0. to\nhave the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.\u201d U.\u00a0S. Const.,\nAmdt. 6. We have held that this right requires effective counsel in\nboth state and federal prosecutions, even if the defendant is\nunable to afford counsel.Gideonv.Wainwright, 372\nU.\u00a0S. 335, 344 (1963) . Counsel is unconstitutionallyineffective if his performance is both deficient, meaning\nhis errors are \u201cso serious\u201d that he no longer functions as\n\u201ccounsel,\u201d and prejudicial, meaning his errors deprive the\ndefendant of a fair trial.Stricklandv.Washington,\n466 U.\u00a0S. 668, 687 (1984) . Applying this standard in name\nonly, the Court of Appeals of Maryland held that James Kulbicki\u2019s\ndefense attorneys were unconstitutionally ineffective. We summarily\nreverse.In 1993, Kulbicki shot his 22-year-old mistress in the head at\npointblank range. The two had been ensnarled in a paternity suit,\nand the killing occurred the weekend before a scheduled hearing\nabout unpaid child support. At Kulbicki\u2019s trial, commencing in\n1995, Agent Ernest Peele of the FBI testified as the State\u2019s expert\non Comparative Bullet Lead Analysis, or CBLA. In testimony of the\nsort CBLA experts had provided for decades, Peele testified that\nthe composition of elements in the molten lead of a bullet fragment\nfound in Kulbicki\u2019s truck matched the composition of lead in a\nbullet fragment removed from the victim\u2019s brain; a similarity of\nthe sort one would \u201c\u00a0\u2018expect\u2019\u00a0\u201d if \u201c\u00a0\u2018examining two\npieces of the same bullet.\u2019\u00a0\u201d 440 Md. 33, 41, 99 A.\u00a03d\n730, 735 (2014). He further testified that a bullet taken from\nKulbicki\u2019s gun was not an \u201cexac[t]\u201d match to the bullet fragments,\nbut was similar enough that the two bullets likely came from the\nsame package.Id.,at 42\u201344, 99 A.\u00a03d, at 735\u2013736.\nAfter considering this ballistics evidence, additional physical\nevidence from Kulbicki\u2019s truck, and witness testimony, the jury\nconvicted Kulbicki of first-degree murder.Kulbicki then filed a petition for post-conviction relief, which\nlingered in state court until 2006 when Kulbicki added a claim that\nhis defense attorneys were ineffective for failing to question the\nlegitimacy of CBLA. By then, 11 years after his conviction, CBLA\nhad fallen out of favor. Indeed, Kulbicki supplemented his petition\nonce more in 2006 after the Court of Appeals of Maryland held for\nthe first time that CBLA evidence was not generally accepted by the\nscientific community and was therefore inadmissible. SeeClemonsv.State, 392 Md. 339, 371, 896 A.\u00a02d\n1059, 1078 (2006).Kulbicki lost in the lower state courts and appealed to the\nCourt of Appeals of Maryland. At that point, Kulbicki abandoned his\nclaim of ineffective assistance with respect to the CBLA evidence,\nbut the high court vacated Kulbicki\u2019s conviction on that ground\nalone. Kulbicki\u2019s counsel, according to the court, should have\nfound a report coauthored by Agent Peele in 1991 that \u201cpresaged the\nflaws in CBLA evidence.\u201d 440 Md., at 40, 99 A.\u00a03d, at 734. One\nof the many findings of the report was that the composition of lead\nin some bullets was the same as that of lead in other bullets\npackaged many months later in a separate box. Rather than conduct\n\u201cfurther research to explain the existence of overlapping\ncompositions,\u201d the authors \u201cspeculated\u201d that coincidence (or, in\none case, the likelihood that separately packaged bullets\noriginated from the same source of lead) caused the overlap.Id., at 49, 99 A.\u00a03d, at 739. The Court of Appeals\nopined that this lone finding should have caused the report\u2019s\nauthors to doubt\u201cthat bullets produced from different\nsources of lead would have a unique chemical composition,\u201d the\nfaulty assumption that ultimately led the court to reject CBLA\nevidence 15 years later.Ibid.; seeClemons,supra, 369\u2013370, 896 A.\u00a02d, at 1077. The authors\u2019\n\u201cfailure to fully explore the variance,\u201d the Court of Appeals\nconcluded, was \u201cat odds with the scientific method.\u201d 440 Md., at\n50, 99 A.\u00a03d, at 740.In the Court of Appeals\u2019 view, any good attorney should have\nspotted this methodological flaw. The court held that counsel\u2019s\nfailure to unearth the report, to identify one of its findings as\n\u201cat odds with the scientific method,\u201d and to use this\nmethodological flaw to cast doubt on CBLA during counsel\u2019s\ncross-examination of Peele, \u201cfell short of prevailing professional\nnorms.\u201dId., at 50\u201353, 99 A.\u00a03d, at 740\u2013742. Concluding\nthat counsel\u2019s supposed deficiency was prejudicial, the court set\naside the conviction and ordered a new trial.Id.,at 56, 99\nA.\u00a03d, at 743\u2013744.We reverse. The Court of Appeals offered no support for its\nconclusion that Kulbicki\u2019s defense attorneys were constitutionally\nrequired to predict the demise of CBLA. Instead, the court indulged\nin the \u201cnatural tendency to speculate as to whether a different\ntrial strategy might have been more successful.\u201dLockhartv.Fretwell, 506 U.\u00a0S. 364, 372 (1993) . To combat this\ntendency, we have \u201cadopted the rule of contemporary assessment of\ncounsel\u2019s conduct.\u201dIbid. Had the Court of Appeals heeded\nthis rule, it would have \u201cjudge[d] the reasonableness of counsel\u2019s\nchallenged conduct . . . viewed as of the time of counsel\u2019s\nconduct.\u201dStrickland,supra, at 690.At the time of Kulbicki\u2019s trial in 1995, the validity of CBLA\nwas widely accepted, and courts regularly admitted CBLA evidence\nuntil 2003. SeeUnited Statesv.Higgs, 663\nF.\u00a03d 726, 738 (CA4 2011). As the Court of Appeals\nacknowledged, even the 1991 report itself did not question the\nvalidity of CBLA, concluding that it was a valid and useful\nforensic tool to match suspect to victim. 440 Md.,at 51,\nn.\u00a011, 99 A.\u00a03d, at 740, n.\u00a011. Counsel did not\nperform deficiently by dedicating their time and focus to elements\nof the defense that did not involve poking methodological holes in\na then-uncontroversial mode of ballistics analysis.That is especially the case here, since there is no reason to\nbelieve that a diligent search would even have discovered the\nsupposedly crucial report. The Court of Appeals offered a single\ncitation in support of its sweeping statement that the report \u201cwas\navailable\u201d to Kulbicki\u2019s counsel in 1995\u2014a Government Printing\nOffice Web page accessed by the Court of Appeals, apparently\nconducting its own Internet research nearly two decades after the\ntrial.Id., at 51, and n.\u00a012, 99 A.\u00a03d, at 741,\nand n.\u00a012; see also Brief in Opposition 14. The Web page\nindicates that a compilation of forensic studies that included the\nreport was \u201cdistributed to various public libraries in 1994.\u201d 440\nMd., at 51, n.\u00a012, 99 A. 3d, at 741, n.\u00a012. But which\nones? And in an era of card catalogues, not a worldwide web, what\nefforts would counsel have had to expend to find the compilation?\nAnd had they found it, would counsel really have combed through the\nentire compilation, and have identified the one (of many) findings\nin one of the reports, the disregard of which counsel would have\nrecognized to be \u201cat odds with the scientific method\u201d? And then,\nwould effective counsel really have brought to the attention of the\njury a report whoseconclusionwas that CBLA was a valid\ninvestigative technique in cases just like Kulbicki\u2019s? Neither the\nCourt of Appeals nor Kulbicki has answers. Given the\nuncontroversial nature of CBLA at the time of Kulbicki\u2019s trial, the\neffect of the judgment below is to demand that lawyers go \u201clooking\nfor a needle in a haystack,\u201d even when they have \u201creason to doubt\nthere is any needle there.\u201dRompillav.Beard, 545\nU.\u00a0S. 374, 389 (2005) . The Court of Appeals demanded\nsomething close to \u201cperfect advocacy\u201d\u2014far more than the \u201creasonable\ncompetence\u201d the right to counsel guarantees.Yarboroughv.Gentry, 540 U. S. 1, 8 (2003) (per curiam).Kulbicki\u2019s trial counsel did not provide deficient performance\nwhen they failed to uncover the 1991 report and to use the report\u2019s\nso-called methodological flaw against Peele on cross-examination.\n(We need not, and so do not, decide whether the supposed error\nprejudiced Kulbicki.) The petition for writ of certiorari is\ngranted, and the judgment of the Court of Appeals for Maryland is\nreversed.It is so ordered.",
