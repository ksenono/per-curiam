    "text": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESMARY ANNE SAUSEv.TIMOTHY J. BAUER, et\u00a0al.on petition for writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the tenth circuitNo. 17\u2013742.\u2003Decided June 28, 2018Per Curiam.Petitioner Mary Ann Sause, proceedingpro\u00a0se, filed\nthis action under Rev. Stat. 1979,42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71983, and\nnamed as defendants past and present members of the Louisburg,\nKansas, police department, as well as the current mayor and a\nformer mayor of the town. The centerpiece of her complaint was the\nallegation that two of the town\u2019s police officers visited her\napartment in response to a noise complaint, gained admittance to\nher apartment, and then proceeded to engage in a course of strange\nand abusive conduct, before citing her for disorderly conduct and\ninterfering with law enforcement. Among other things, she alleged\nthat at one point she knelt and began to pray but one of the\nofficers ordered her to stop. She claimed that a third officer\nrefused to investigate her complaint that she had been assaulted by\nresidents of her apartment complex and had threatened to issue a\ncitation if she reported this to another police department. In\naddition, she alleged that the police chief failed to follow up on\na promise to investigate the officers\u2019 conduct and that the present\nand former mayors were aware of unlawful conduct by the town\u2019s\npolice officers.Petitioner\u2019s complaint asserted a violation of her First\nAmendment right to the free exercise of religion and her Fourth\nAmendment right to be free of any unreasonable search or seizure.\nThe defendants moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state\na claim on which relief may be granted, arguing that the defendants\nwere entitled to qualified immunity. Petitioner then moved to amend\nher complaint, but the District Court denied that motion and\ngranted the motion to dismiss.On appeal, petitioner, now represented by counsel, argued only\nthat her free exercise rights were violated by the two officers who\nentered her home. The Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit\naffirmed the decision of the District Court, concluding that the\nofficers were entitled to qualified immunity. 859 F. 3d 1270\n(2017). Chief Judge Tymkovich filed a concurring opinion. While\nagreeing with the majority regarding petitioner\u2019s First Amendment\nclaim, he noted that petitioner\u2019s \u201callegations fit more neatly in\nthe Fourth Amendment context.\u201dId.,at 1279. He also\nobserved that if the allegations in the complaint are true, the\nconduct of the officers \u201cshould be condemned,\u201d and that if the\nallegations are untrue, petitioner had \u201cdone the officers a grave\ninjustice.\u201dIbid.The petition filed in this Court contends that the Court of\nAppeals erred in holding that the officers who visited petitioner\u2019s\nhome are entitled to qualified immunity. The petition argues that\nit was clearly established that law enforcement agents violate a\nperson\u2019s right to the free exercise of religion if they interfere,\nwithout any legitimate law enforcement justification, when a person\nis at prayer. The petition further maintains that the absence of a\nprior case involving the unusual situation alleged to have occurred\nhere does not justify qualified immunity.There can be no doubt that the First Amendment protects the\nright to pray. Prayer unquestionably constitutes the \u201cexercise\u201d of\nreligion. At the same time, there are clearly circumstances in\nwhich a police officer may lawfully prevent a person from praying\nat a particular time and place. For example, if an officer places a\nsuspect under arrest and orders the suspect to enter a police\nvehicle for transportation to jail, the suspect does not have a\nright to delay that trip by insisting on first engaging in conduct\nthat, at another time, would be protected by the First Amendment.\nWhen an officer\u2019s order to stop praying is alleged to have occurred\nduring the course of investigative conduct that implicates Fourth\nAmendment rights, the First and Fourth Amendment issues may be\ninextricable.That is the situation here. As the case comes before us, it is\nunclear whether the police officers were in petitioner\u2019s apartment\nat the time in question based on her consent, whether they had some\nother ground consistent with the Fourth Amendment for entering and\nremaining there, or whether their entry or continued presence was\nunlawful. Petitioner\u2019s complaint contains no express allegations on\nthese matters. Nor does her complaint state what, if anything, the\nofficers wanted her to do at the time when she was allegedly told\nto stop praying. Without knowing the answers to these questions, it\nis impossible to analyze petitioner\u2019s free exercise claim.In considering the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss, the District\nCourt was required to interpret thepro\u00a0secomplaint\nliberally, and when the complaint is read that way, it may be\nunderstood to state Fourth Amendment claims that could not properly\nbe dismissed for failure to state a claim. We appreciate that\npetitioner elected on appeal to raise only a First Amendment\nargument and not to pursue an independent Fourth Amendment claim,\nbut under the circumstances, the First Amendment claim demanded\nconsideration of the ground on which the officers were present in\nthe apartment and the nature of any legitimate law enforcement\ninterests that might have justified an order to stop praying at the\nspecific time in question. Without considering these matters,\nneither the free exercise issue nor the officers\u2019 entitlement to\nqualified immunity can be resolved. Thus, petitioner\u2019s choice to\nabandon her Fourth Amendment claim on appeal did not obviate the\nneed to address these matters.For these reasons, we grant the petition for a writ of\ncertiorari; we reverse the judgment of the Tenth Circuit; and we\nremand the case for further proceedings consistent with this\nopinion.It is so ordered.",
