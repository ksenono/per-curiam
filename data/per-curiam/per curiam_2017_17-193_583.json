    "text": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESJEFFERSON DUNN, COMMISSIONER, ALABAMA\nDEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONSv.VERNON MADISONon petition for writ of certiorari to the\nunited states court of appeals for the eleventh circuitNo. 17\u2013193.\u2003Decided November 6, 2017Per Curiam.More than 30 years ago, Vernon Madison crept up\nbehind police officer Julius Schulte and shot him twice in the head\nat close range. An Alabama jury found Madison guilty of capital\nmurder. The trial court sentenced him to death. SeeEx\u00a0parte Madison, 718 So.\u00a02d 104, 105\u2013106\n(1998).In 2016, as Madison\u2019s execution neared, he\npetitioned the trial court for a suspension of his death sentence.\nHe argued that, due to several recent strokes, he has become\nincompetent to be executed. The court held a hearing to receive\ntestimony from two psychologists who had examined Madison and\nprepared reports concerning his competence. The court\u2019s appointed\npsychologist, Dr. Karl Kirkland, reported that, although Madison\nmay have \u201csuffered a significant decline post-stroke,\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. [he] understands the exact posture of his case at\nthis point,\u201d and appears to have a \u201crational understanding of\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. the results or effects\u201d of his death sentence. App.\nto Pet. for Cert. 75a (internal quotation marks omitted);Madisonv.Commissioner, Ala. Dept. of Corrections,\n851 F.\u00a03d 1173, 1193 (CA11 2017) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Asked at the hearing whether Madison understands that\nAlabama is seeking retribution against him for his criminal act,\nDr. Kirkland answered, \u201cCertainly.\u201dId., at 1180 (internal\nquotation marks omitted).Dr. John Goff, a psychologist hired by Madison\u2019s\ncounsel, reported that Madison\u2019s strokes have rendered him unable\nto remember \u201cnumerous events that have occurred over the past\nthirty years or more.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 77a. Nevertheless,\nDr. Goff found that Madison \u201cis able to understand the nature of\nthe pending proceeding and he has an understanding of what he was\ntried for\u201d; that he knows he is \u201cin prison .\u00a0.\u00a0. because\nof \u2018murder\u2019\u00a0\u201d; that he \u201cunderstands that .\u00a0.\u00a0.\n[Alabama is] seeking retribution\u201d for that crime; and that he\n\u201cunderstands the sentence, specifically the meaning of a death\nsentence.\u201dId.,at 76a\u201378a (some internal quotation marks\nomitted). In Dr. Goff\u2019s opinion, however, Madison does not\n\u201cunderstan[d] the act that .\u00a0.\u00a0. he is being punished\nfor\u201d because he cannot recall \u201cthe sequence of events from the\noffense to his arrest to the trial or any of those details\u201d and\nbelieves that he \u201cnever went around killing folks.\u201dIbid.(internal quotation marks omitted).The trial court denied Madison\u2019s petition. It\nheld that, under this Court\u2019s decisions inFordv.Wainwright, 477 U.\u00a0S. 399 (1986) , andPanettiv.Quarterman, 551 U.\u00a0S. 930 (2007) , Madison was\nentitled to relief if he could show that he \u201csuffers from a mental\nillness which deprives [him] of the mental capacity to rationally\nunderstand that he is being executed as a punishment for a crime.\u201d\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 74a. The court concluded that Madison had\nfailed to make that showing. Specifically, it found that Madison\nunderstands \u201cthat he is going to be executed because of the murder\nhe committed[,] .\u00a0.\u00a0. that the State is seeking\nretribution[,] and that he will die when he is executed.\u201dId.,at 82a.Madison then filed a petition for a writ of\nhabeas corpus in Federal District Court. As a state prisoner,\nMadison is entitled to federal habeas relief under the\nAntiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) only\nif the state trial court\u2019s adjudication of his incompetence claim\n\u201cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of,\nclearly established Federal law, as determined by\u201d this Court, or\nelse was \u201cbased on an unreasonable determination of the facts in\nlight of the evidence presented\u201d in state court. 28\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a02254(d). A habeas petitioner meets this\ndemanding standard only when he shows that the state court\u2019s\ndecision was \u201cso lacking in justification that there was an error\nwell understood and comprehended in existing law beyond any\npossibility for fairminded disagreement.\u201dHarringtonv.Richter, 562 U.\u00a0S. 86, 103 (2011) . The District Court\ndenied Madison\u2019s petition after concluding that the state court\n\u201ccorrectly appliedFordandPanetti\u201d and did not make\nan \u201cunreasonable determination of the facts in light of the\nevidence.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 67a.The Eleventh Circuit granted a certificate of\nappealability and, on appeal, reversed over Judge Jordan\u2019s dissent.\nIn the majority\u2019s view, given the undisputed fact that Madison \u201chas\nno memory of his capital offense,\u201d it inescapably follows that he\n\u201cdoes not rationally understand the connection between his crime\nand his execution.\u201d 851 F.\u00a03d, at 1185\u20131186. On that basis,\nthe Eleventh Circuit held that the trial court\u2019s conclusion that\nMadison is competent to be executed was \u201cplainly unreasonable\u201d and\n\u201ccannot be reconciled with any reasonable application ofPanetti.\u201dId.,at 1187\u20131188 (internal quotation marks\nomitted).We disagree. InPanetti, this Court\naddressed the question whether the Eighth Amendment forbids the\nexecution of a prisoner who lacks \u201cthe mental capacity to\nunderstand that [he] is being executed as a punishment for a\ncrime.\u201d 551 U.\u00a0S., at 954 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nWe noted that the retributive purpose of capital punishment is not\nwell served where \u201cthe prisoner\u2019s mental state is so distorted by a\nmental illness that his awareness of the crime and punishment has\nlittle or no relation to the understanding of those concepts shared\nby the community as a whole.\u201dId.,at 958\u2013959. Similarly, inFord, we questioned the \u201cretributive value of executing a\nperson who has no comprehension of why he has been singled out.\u201d\n477 U.\u00a0S., at 409. NeitherPanettinorFord\u201cclearly established\u201d that a prisoner is incompetent to be executed\nbecause of a failure to remember his commission of the crime, as\ndistinct from a failure to rationally comprehend the concepts of\ncrime and punishment as applied in his case. The state court did\nnot unreasonably applyPanettiandFordwhen it\ndetermined that Madison is competent to be executed\nbecause\u2014notwithstanding his memory loss\u2014he recognizes that he will\nbe put to death as punishment for the murder he was found to have\ncommitted.Nor was the state court\u2019s decision founded on an\nunreasonable assessment of the evidence before it. Testimony from\neach of the psychologists who examined Madison supported the\ncourt\u2019s finding that Madison understands both that he was tried and\nimprisoned for murder and that Alabama will put him to death as\npunishment for that crime.In short, the state court\u2019s determinations of\nlaw and fact were not \u201cso lacking in justification\u201d as to give rise\nto error \u201cbeyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.\u201dRichter,supra, at 103. Under that deferential\nstandard, Madison\u2019s claim to federal habeas relief must fail. We\nexpress no view on the merits of the underlying question outside of\nthe AEDPA context.The petition for a writ of certiorari and\nrespondent\u2019s motion to proceedin forma pauperisare\ngranted, and the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.It is so ordered.",
