    "text": "PER CURIAMWILSON V. CORCORAN562 U. S. ____ (2010)SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESBILL K. WILSON, SUPERINTENDANT, INDIANA STATE\nPRISONv.JOSEPH E. CORCORANon petition for writ of certiorari to the united\nstates court of appeals for the seventh circuitNo. 10\u201391.\u2003Decided November 8, 2010Per Curiam.Federal courts may not issue\nwrits of habeas corpus to state prisoners whose confinement does\nnot violate federal law. Because the Court of Appeals granted the\nwrit to respondent without finding such a violation, we vacate its\njudgment and remand.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*In 1997, respondent Joseph\nCorcoran shot and killed four men, including his brother and his\nsister\u2019s fianc\u00e9. An Indiana jury found him guilty of four counts of\nmurder, found the statutory aggravating circumstance of multiple\nmurders, and unanimously recommended capital punishment. The trial\njudge agreed and sentenced respondent to death.But on appeal, the Supreme Court\nof Indiana vacated the sentence out of concern that the trial judge\nmight have violated Indiana law by relying partly on nonstatutory\naggravating factors when imposing the death penalty.Corcoranv.State,739 N.\u00a0E. 2d 649, 657\u2013658\n(2000). When addressing respondent at sentencing, the trial court\nhad remarked:\u201c\u00a0\u2018[T]he knowing and intentional murders of\nfour innocent people is an extremely heinous and aggravated\ncrime\u2026\u00a0. I don\u2019t think in the history of this county we\u2019ve had\na mass murderer such as yourself. It makes you, Mr. Corcoran, a\nvery dangerous, evil mass murderer. And I am convinced in my heart\nof hearts, \u2026 if given the opportunity, you will murder\nagain.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId., at 657 (quoting transcript).According to the Indiana Supreme Court, the trial\njudge\u2019s reference to the innocence of respondent\u2019s victims, the\nheinousness of his offense, and his future dangerousness was not\nnecessarily improper; it is permissible to provide \u201can appropriate\ncontext for consideration of the alleged aggravating and mitigating\ncircumstances.\u201dIbid.(internal quotation marks omitted).\nBut because the trial court might have meant that it weighed these\nfactors as aggravating circumstances, the Indiana Supreme Court\nremanded for resentencing. Seeibid.On remand, the trial court issued a revised\nsentencing order. It wrote:\u201c\u00a0\u2018\u00a0The trial Court, in balancing the\nproved aggravators and mitigators, emphasizes to the Supreme Court\nthat it only relied upon those proven statutory aggravators. The\ntrial Court\u2019s remarks at the sentencing hearing, and the language\nin the original sentencing order explain why such high weight was\ngiven to the statutory aggravator of multiple murder, and further\nsupport the trial Court\u2019s personal conclusion that the sentence is\nappropriate punishment for this offender and these crimes.\u2019\u00a0\u201dCorcoranv.State, 774 N.\u00a0E. 2d 495, 498\n(Ind. 2002) (quoting order).On appeal, over respondent\u2019s objection, the Supreme\nCourt accepted this explanation and affirmed the sentence.Id.,at 498\u2013499, 502. It explained that it was \u201cnow\nsatisfied that the trial court has relied on only aggravators\nlisted in Indiana Code \u00a735\u201350\u20132\u20139(b)\u2026\u00a0. There is no lack of\nclarity in [the trial court\u2019s] statement and no plausible reason to\nbelieve it untrue.\u201dId.,at 499.Respondent later applied to the United States\nDistrict Court for the Northern District of Indiana for a writ of\nhabeas corpus. His habeas petition asserted a number of grounds for\nrelief, including a renewed claim that, notwithstanding its\nassurances to the contrary, the trial court improperly relied on\nnonstatutory aggravating factors when it resentenced him.\nRespondent also asserted that this reliance violated the Eighth and\nFourteenth Amendments. Record, Doc. 13, p. 11. In its response to\nthe petition, the State specifically disputed that contention.Id., Doc. 33, p. 16 (\u201c[Respondent] fails to establish any\nconstitutional deficiency in [the] Indiana Supreme Court\u2019s review\nof the trial court\u2019s treatment of Corcoran\u2019s sentence on remand,\nlet alone does it show that the state supreme court\u2019s judgment is\nin any way inconsistent with applicable United States Supreme Court\nprecedent\u201d).The District Court, however, had no need to\nresolve this dispute because it granted habeas relief on a wholly\ndifferent ground: that an offer by the prosecutor to take the death\npenalty off the table in exchange for a waiver of a jury trial had\nviolated the Sixth Amendment.Corcoranv.Buss,\n483 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d 709, 725\u2013726 (2007). It did not address the\nsentencing challenge because that was \u201crendered moot\u201d by the grant\nof habeas relief.Id.,at 734.The State appealed, and the Seventh Circuit\nreversed the District Court\u2019s Sixth Amendment ruling.Corcoranv.Buss, 551 F.\u00a03d 703, 712, 714\n(2008). Then, evidently overlooking respondent\u2019s remaining\nsentencing claims, the Seventh Circuit remanded the case to the\nDistrict Court \u201cwith instructions to deny the writ.\u201dId.,\nat 714. To correct this oversight, we granted certiorari and\nvacated the Seventh Circuit\u2019s judgment.Corcoranv.Levenhagen,558 U. S. 1(2009)(per curiam). We explained that the Court of Appeals\n\u201cshould have permitted the District Court to consider Corcoran\u2019s\nunresolved challenges to his death sentence on remand, or should\nhave itself explained why such consideration was unnecessary.\u201dId.,at ___ (slip op., at 2).On remand\u2014and without any opportunity for\nbriefing by the parties\u2014the Court of Appeals changed course andgrantedhabeas relief.Corcoranv.Levenhagen, 593 F.\u00a03d 547, 555 (2010). After\ndetermining that respondent\u2019s sentencing challenge had been waived\nby his failure to include it in his original cross-appeal, the\nSeventh Circuit concluded that the claim satisfied plain-error\nreview.Id.,at 551. The panel explained that, \u201cunlike the\nIndiana Supreme Court,\u201d it was unsatisfied with the trial court\u2019s\nrepresentation that it relied only on aggravating factors\nauthorized by Indiana law.Ibid.Because the trial court\u2019s\nrevised sentencing order said that it used the nonstatutory factors\nof heinousness, victims\u2019 innocence, and future dangerousness to\ndetermine the weight given to the aggravator of multiple murders,\nthe Seventh Circuit concluded that the Indiana Supreme Court had\nmade an \u201c\u00a0\u2018unreasonable determination of the facts\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nwhen it accepted the trial court\u2019s representation that it did not\nrely on those factors as aggravating circumstances.Ibid.(quoting 28 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a72254(d)(2)). The panel therefore\nrequired the Indiana trial court to reconsider its sentencing\ndetermination in order to \u201cprevent non-compliance with Indiana\nlaw.\u201d 593 F. 3d, at 552\u2013553.But it is only noncompliance withfederallaw that renders a State\u2019s criminal judgment\nsusceptible to collateral attack in the federal courts. The habeas\nstatute unambiguously provides that a federal court may issue the\nwrit to a state prisoner \u201conly on the ground that he is in custody\nin violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United\nStates.\u201d 28 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a72254(a). And we have repeatedly held\nthat \u201c\u00a0\u2018federal habeas corpus relief does not lie for errors\nof state law.\u2019\u00a0\u201dEstellev.McGuire,502 U. S. 62, 67\n(1991) (quotingLewisv.Jeffers,497 U. S. 764, 780\n(1990)). \u201c[I]t is not the province of a federal habeas court to\nreexamine state-court determinations on state-law questions.\u201d 502\nU. S., at 67\u201368. But here, the panel\u2019s opinion contained no hint\nthat it thought the violation of Indiana law it had unearthed also\nentailed the infringement of any federal right. Not only did the\ncourt frame respondent\u2019s claim as whether \u201cthe Indiana trial court\nconsidered non-statutory aggravating circumstances \u2026 in\ncontravention ofstate law,\u201d 593 F.\u00a03d, at 551\n(emphasis added), it also explicitly acknowledged that \u201c[n]othing\nin [its] opinion prevents Indiana from adopting a rule permitting\nthe use of non-statutory aggravators in the death sentence\nselection process.See Zant v. Stephens,462 U. S. 862, 878\n(1983) (permitting their use under federal law),\u201did., at\n551\u2013552 (citations omitted).Nor did it suffice for the Court of Appeals to\nfind an unreasonable determination of the facts under 28 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a72254(d)(2). That provision allows habeas petitioners to\navoid the bar to habeas relief imposed with respect to federal\nclaims adjudicated on the merits in state court by showing that the\nstate court\u2019s decision was \u201cbased on an unreasonable determination\nof the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court\nproceeding.\u201d It does not repeal the command of \u00a72254(a) that habeas\nrelief may be afforded to a state prisoner \u201conly on the ground\u201d\nthat his custody violates federal law.In response to the Seventh Circuit\u2019s opinion,\nthe State filed a petition for rehearing and rehearing en banc. The\nState\u2019s petition argued that the Seventh Circuit had erred by\ngranting relief in the absence of a federal violation. It also\ncontended, on the authority of our opinion inWainwrightv.Goode,464 U. S. 78(1983)(per\ncuriam), that the Court of Appeals erred by second-guessing\nthe Indiana Supreme Court\u2019s factual determination that its own\ntrial court complied with Indiana law.The Seventh Circuit denied rehearing, but\namended its opinion to include this language:\u201cThis [remand for resentencing] will cure the state\ntrial court\u2019s \u2018unreasonable determination of the facts.\u2019 28 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a72254(d)(1)[sic].(It will also prevent\nnoncompliance with Indiana law. [Corcoran] contended that, under\nthe circumstances of this case, noncompliance with state law also\nviolates the federal Constitution and thus warrants him relief\nunder 28 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a72254(d)(2). [The State] has not advanced\nany contrary argument based onWainwright v. Goode,464 U. S. 78(1983), or any similar\ndecision.)\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 144a\u2013145a.The amendment did not cure the\ndefect. It is not enough to note that a habeas petitionerassertsthe existence of a constitutional violation;\nunless the federal court agrees with that assertion, it may not\ngrant relief. The Seventh Circuit\u2019s opinion reflects no such\nagreement, nor does it even articulate what federal right was\nallegedly infringed. In fact, as to one possible federal claim, the\ncourt maintains that it wouldnotviolate federal law for\nIndiana to adopt a rule authorizing what the trial court did. 593\nF. 3d, at 551\u2013552.In lieu of finding or even describing a\nconstitutional error, the amended opinion says only that the State\nhad not \u201cadvanced any contrary argument based onWainwrightv.Goode\u2026 or any similar\ndecision.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 145a. It is not clear what this\nlanguage was meant to convey. It cannot have meant that the State\nforfeited the position that respondent\u2019s allegations do not state a\nconstitutional violation, since (as we observed) the State\nexplicitly disputed that point before the District Court\u2014the last\nforum in which the subject had been raised, leading the Court of\nAppeals to conclude thatrespondenthad waived the claim\nentirely. 593 F.\u00a03d, at 551. And there is no suggestion that\nthe State has everconcededthe existence of a federal\nright to be sentenced in accordance with Indiana law. Under those\ncircumstances, it was improper for the Court of Appeals to issue\nthe writ without first concluding that a violation of federal law\nhad been established.The petition for a writ of certiorari and\nrespondent\u2019s motion for leave to proceedin forma pauperisare granted. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and\nthe case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this\nopinion. We express no view about the merits of the habeas\npetition.It is so ordered.",
