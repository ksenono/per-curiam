ILLINOISon petition for writ of certiorari to the\nsupreme court of illinoisNo. 13\u20135967.\u2003Decided May 27, 2014Per Curiam.The trial of Esteban Martinez was set to begin\non May 17, 2010. His counsel was ready; the State was not. When the\ncourt swore in the jury and invited the State to present its first\nwitness, the State declined to present any evidence. So Martinez\nmoved for a directed not-guilty verdict, and the court granted it.\nThe State appealed, arguing that the trial court should have\ngranted its motion for a continuance. The question is whether the\nDouble Jeopardy Clause bars the State\u2019s attempt to appeal in the\nhope of subjecting Martinez to a new trial.The Illinois Supreme Court manifestly erred in\nallowing the State\u2019s appeal, on the theory that jeopardy never\nattached because Martinez \u201cwas never at risk of conviction.\u201d 2013\nIL 113475, \u00b639, 990 N.E.2d 215, 224. Our cases have repeatedly\nstated the bright-line rule that \u201cjeopardy attaches when the jury\nis empaneled and sworn.\u201d Crist v. Bretz,437 U.S.\n28, 35 (1978) ; see infra, at 6. There is simply no doubt that\nMartinez was subjected to jeopardy. And because the trial court\nfound the State\u2019s evidence insufficient to sustain a conviction,\nthere is equally no doubt that Martinez may not be retried.We therefore grant Martinez\u2019s petition for\ncertiorari and reverse the judgment of the Illinois Supreme\nCourt.IAThe State of Illinois indicted Martinez in\nAugust 2006 on charges of aggravated battery and mob action against\nAvery Binion and Demarco Scott. But Martinez\u2019s trial date did not\narrive for nearly four years. [1]The story picks up for present purposes on July\n20, 2009, when the State moved to continue an August 3 trial date\nbecause it had not located the complaining witnesses, Binion and\nScott. The State subpoenaed both men four days later, and the court\nrescheduled Martinez\u2019s trial to September 28. But the State sought\nanother continuance, shortly before that date, because it still had\nnot found Binion and Scott. The court rescheduled the trial to\nNovember 9, and the State reissued subpoenas. But November 9 came\nand went (the court continued the case when Martinez showed up\nlate) and the trial was eventually delayed to the following March\n29. In early February, the State yet again subpoenaed Binion and\nScott. When March 29 arrived, the trial court granted the State\nan-other continuance. It reset the trial date for May 17 and\nordered Binion and Scott to appear in court on May 10. And the\nState once more issued subpoenas. [2]On the morning of May 17, however, Binion and\nScott were again nowhere to be found. At 8:30, when the trial was\nset to begin, the State asked for a brief continuance. The court\noffered to delay swearing the jurors until a complete jury had been\nempaneled and told the State that it could at that point either\nhave the jury sworn or move to dismiss its case. When Binion and\nScott still had not shown up after the jury was chosen, the court\noffered to call the other cases on its docket so as to delay\nswearing the jury a bit longer. But when all these delays had run\nout, Binion and Scott were still nowhere in sight. The State filed\na written motion for a continuance, arguing that it was \u201cunable to\nproceed\u201d without Binion and Scott. Tr. 7. The court denied that\nmotion:\u201cThe case before the Court began on July 7,\n2006. In two months we will then be embarking upon half a decade of\npending a Class 3 felony. Avery Binion, Jr., and Demarco [Scott]\nare well known in Elgin, both are convicted felons. One would\nbelieve that the Elgin Police Department would know their\nwhereabouts. They were ordered to be in court today. The Court will\nissue body writs for both of these gentlemen.\u201cIn addition, the State\u2019s list of witnesses\nindi- cates twelve witnesses. Excluding Mr. Scott and Mr. Binion,\nthat\u2019s ten witnesses. The Court would anticipate it would take\nevery bit of today and most of tomorrow to get through ten\nwitnesses. By then the People may have had a chance to execute the\narrest warrant body writs for these two gentlemen.\u201cThe Court will deny the motion for continuance.\nI will swear the jury in in 15, 20 minutes. Perhaps you might want\nto send the police out to find these two gentlemen.\u201d Id., at\n8\u20139.After a brief recess, the court offered to delay\nthe start of the trial for several more hours if the continuance\nwould \u201cbe of any help\u201d to the State. Id., at 9. But when the State\nmade clear that Binion and Scott\u2019s \u201cwhereabouts\u201d remained\n\u201cunknown,\u201d the court concluded that the delay \u201cwould be a further\nwaste of time.\u201d Id., at 10. The following colloquy ensued:\u201cTHE COURT: .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. It\u2019s a\nquarter to eleven and [Binion and Scott] have not appeared on their\nown will, so I\u2019m going to bring the jury in now then to swear\nthem.\u201c[The Prosecutor]: Okay. Your Honor, may I\napproach briefly?\u201cTHE COURT: Yes.\u201c[The Prosecutor]: Your Honor, just so your\nHonor is aware, I know that it\u2019s the process to bring them in and\nswear them in; however, the State will not be participating in the\ntrial. I wanted to let you know that.\u201cTHE COURT: Very well. We\u2019ll see how that\nworks.\u201d Id., at 10\u201311.The jury was then sworn. After instructing the\njury, the court directed the State to proceed with its opening\nstatement. The prosecutor demurred: \u201cYour Honor, respect- fully,\nthe State is not participating in this case.\u201d Id., at 20. After the\ndefense waived its opening statement, the court directed the State\nto call its first witness. Again, the prosecutor demurred:\n\u201cRespectfully, your Honor, the State is not participating in this\nmatter.\u201d Ibid. The defense then moved for a judgment of\nacquittal:\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Judge, the jury has been\nsworn. The State has not presented any evidence. I believe they\u2019ve\nindicated their intention not to present any evidence or\nwitnesses.\u201cBased on that, Judge, I would ask the Court to\nenter directed findings of not guilty to both counts, ag- gravated\nbattery and mob action.\u201cTHE COURT: Do the People wish to reply?\u201c[The Prosecutor]: No, your Honor.\nRespectfully, the State is not participating.\u201cTHE COURT: The Court will grant the motion for\na directed finding and dismiss the charges.\u201d Id., at 21.BThe State appealed, arguing that the trial\ncourt should have granted a continuance. Martinez responded that\nthe State\u2019s appeal was improper because he had been acquitted. The\nIllinois Appellate Court sided with the State, holding that\njeopardy had never attached and that the trial court had erred in\nfailing to grant a continuance. 2011 IL App (2d) 100498, \u00b6\u00b646,\n53\u201356, 969 N.E.2d 840, 854, 856\u2013858.The Illinois Supreme Court granted review on the\njeopardy issue and affirmed. 2013 IL 113475, 990 N.E.2d 215. It\nbegan by recognizing that \u201c[g]enerally, in cases of a jury trial,\njeopardy attaches when a jury is empaneled and sworn, as that is\nthe point when the defendant is \u2018\u00a0\u201cput to trial before the\ntrier of the facts.\u201d\u00a0\u2019\u00a0\u201d Id., \u00b623, 990 N. E. 2d, at 222\n(quoting Serfass v. United States,420 U.S.\n377, 394 (1975) ). But it reasoned that under this Court\u2019s\nprecedents, \u201c\u00a0\u2018\u00a0\u201crigid, mechanical\u201d rules\u2019\u00a0\u201d should\nnot govern the inquiry into whether jeopardy has attached. 2013 IL\n113475, \u00b624, 990 N.\u00a0E. 2d, at 222 (quoting Serfass, supra, at\n390). Rather, it opined, the relevant question is whether a\ndefendant \u201cwas \u2018\u00a0\u201csubjected to the hazards of trial and\npossible conviction.\u201d\u00a0\u2019\u00a0\u201d 2013 IL 113475, \u00b624, 990\nN.\u00a0E. 2d, at 222 (quoting Serfass, supra, at 391).Here, the court concluded, Martinez \u201cwas never\nat risk of conviction\u201d\u2014and jeopardy therefore did not\nattach\u2014because \u201c[t]he State indicated it would not participate\nprior to the jury being sworn.\u201d 2013 IL 113475, \u00b639, 990 N.\u00a0E.\n2d, at 224. And because Martinez \u201cwas not placed in jeopardy,\u201d the\ncourt held, the trial \u201ccourt\u2019s entry of directed verdicts of not\nguilty did not constitute true acquittals.\u201d Id., \u00b640, 990\nN.\u00a0E. 2d, at 225. Indeed, the court remarked, the trial court\n\u201crepeatedly referred to its action as a \u2018dismissal\u2019 rather than an\nacquittal.\u201d Ibid.Justice Burke dissented, writing that the\nmajority\u2019s conclusion \u201cthat impaneling and swearing the jury had no\nlegal significance\u201d ran \u201ccontrary to well-established principles\nregarding double jeopardy.\u201d Id., \u00b657, 990 N.\u00a0E. 2d, at 227.\nMoreover, she argued, its assertion that Martinez was not in danger\nof conviction was \u201cbelied by the actions of the court and the\nprosecutor.\u201d Id., \u00b663, 990 N.\u00a0E. 2d, at 229. She explained\nthat under the majority\u2019s holding, the State could \u201cunilaterally\nrender a trial a \u2018sham\u2019 simply by refusing to call witnesses after\na jury has been selected.\u201d Id., \u00b664, 990 N.\u00a0E. 2d, at 229.IIThis case presents two issues. First, did\njeopardy attach to Martinez? Second, if so, did the proceeding end\nin such a manner that the Double Jeopardy Clause bars his retrial?\nOur precedents clearly dictate an affirmative answer to each\nquestion.AThere are few if any rules of criminal\nprocedure clearer than the rule that \u201cjeopardy attaches when the\njury is empaneled and sworn.\u201d Crist, 437 U.\u00a0S., at 35; see\nalso United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co.,430 U.S.\n564, 569 (1977) ; Serfass, supra, at 388; 6 W. LaFave, J.\nIsrael, N. King, & O. Kerr, Criminal Procedure \u00a725.1(d) (3d ed.\n2007).Our clearest exposition of this rule came in\nCrist, which addressed the constitutionality of a Montana statute\nproviding that jeopardy did not attach until the swearing of the\nfirst witness. As Crist explains, \u201cthe precise point at which\njeopardy [attaches] in a jury trial might have been open to\nargument before this Court\u2019s decision in Downum v. United States,372\nU.S. 734[(1963)],\u201d in which \u201cthe Court held that the Double\nJeopardy Clause prevented a second prosecution of a defendant whose\nfirst trial had ended just after the jury had been sworn and before\nany testimony had been taken.\u201d 437 U.\u00a0S., at 35. But Downum\nput any such argument to rest: Its holding \u201cnecessarily pinpointed\nthe stage in a jury trial when jeopardy attaches, and [it] has\nsince been understood as explicit authority for the proposition\nthat jeopardy attaches when the jury is empaneled and sworn.\u201d\nCrist, supra, at 35.The Illinois Supreme Court misread our\nprecedents in suggesting that the swearing of the jury is anything\nother than a bright line at which jeopardy attaches. It relied on\nSerfass, understanding that case to mean \u201cthat in assessing whether\nand when jeopardy attaches, \u2018\u00a0\u201crigid, mechanical\u201d rules\u2019\nshould not be applied.\u201d 2013 IL 113475, \u00b624, 990 N.\u00a0E. 2d, at\n222. Under Serfass, the court reasoned, the relevant question is\nwhether a defendant was as a functional matter\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018\u00a0\u201csubjected to the hazards of trial and possible\nconviction.\u201d\u00a0\u2019\u00a0\u201d 2013 IL 113475, \u00b624, 990 N.\u00a0E. 2d,\nat 222.But Serfass does not apply a functional approach\nto the determination of when jeopardy has attached. As to that\nquestion, it states the same bright-line rule as every other case:\nJeopardy attaches when \u201ca defendant is \u2018put to trial,\u2019\u00a0\u201d and\nin a jury trial, that is \u201cwhen a jury is empaneled and sworn.\u201d 420\nU.\u00a0S., at 388. Indeed, Serfass explicitly rejects a functional\napproach to the question whether jeopardy has attached. See id., at\n390 (refuting the defendant\u2019s argument that \u201c\u00a0\u2018constructiv[e]\njeopardy had attached\u2019\u00a0\u201d upon the pretrial grant of a motion\nto dismiss the indictment, which the defendant characterized as\n\u201cthe \u2018functional equivalent of an acquittal on the merits\u2019\u00a0\u201d).\nThe Serfass Court acknowledged \u201cthat we have disparaged \u2018rigid,\nmechanical\u2019 rules in the interpretation of the Double Jeopardy\nClause.\u201d Ibid. But it was referring to the case of Illinois v.\nSomerville,410 U.S.\n458(1973) , in which we declined to apply \u201crigid, mechanical\u201d\nreasoning in answering a very different question: not whether\njeopardy had attached, but whether the manner in which it\nterminated (by mistrial) barred the defendant\u2019s retrial. Id., at\n467. By contrast, Serfass explains, the rule that jeopardy attaches\nat the start of a trial is \u201cby no means a mere technicality, nor is\nit a \u2018rigid, mechanical\u2019 rule.\u201d 420 U.\u00a0S., at 391. And\ncontrary to the Illinois Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation, Serfass\ncreates not the slightest doubt about when a \u201ctrial\u201d begins.The Illinois Supreme Court\u2019s error was\nconsequential, for it introduced confusion into what we have\nconsistently treated as a bright-line rule: A jury trial begins,\nand jeopardy attaches, when the jury is sworn. We have never\nsuggested the exception perceived by the Illinois Supreme\nCourt\u2014that jeopardy may not have attached where, under the\ncircumstances of a particular case, the defendant was not genuinely\nat risk of conviction. [3]\nMartinez was subjected to jeopardy because the jury in his case was\nsworn.B\u201c\u00a0\u2018[T]he conclusion that jeopardy has\nattached,\u2019\u00a0\u201d how- ever, \u201c\u00a0\u2018begins, rather than ends, the\ninquiry as to whether the Double Jeopardy Clause bars\nretrial.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Id., at 390. The remaining question is whether the\njeopardy ended in such a manner that the defendant may not be\nretried. See 6 LaFave \u00a725.1(g) (surveying circumstances in which\nretrial is and is not allowed). Here, there is no doubt that\nMartinez\u2019s jeopardy ended in a manner that bars his retrial: The\ntrial court acquitted him of the charged offenses. \u201cPerhaps the\nmost fundamental rule in the history of double jeopardy\njurisprudence has been that \u2018[a] verdict of acquittal\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. could not be reviewed .\u00a0.\u00a0. without\nputting [a defendant] twice in jeopardy, and thereby violating the\nConstitution.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Martin Linen, supra, at 571.\u201c[O]ur cases have defined an acquittal to\nencompass any ruling that the prosecution\u2019s proof is insufficient\nto establish criminal liability for an offense.\u201d Evans v. Michigan,\n568 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 4\u20135). And the trial\ncourt clearly made such a ruling here. After the State declined to\npresent evidence against Martinez, his counsel moved for \u201cdirected\nfindings of not guilty to both counts,\u201d and the court \u201cgrant[ed]\nthe motion for a directed finding.\u201d Tr. 21. That is a textbook\nacquittal: a finding that the State\u2019s evidence cannot support a\nconviction.The Illinois Supreme Court thought otherwise. It\nfirst opined that \u201c[b]ecause [Martinez] was not placed in jeopardy,\nthe [trial] court\u2019s entry of directed verdicts of not guilty did\nnot constitute true acquittals.\u201d 2013 IL 113475, \u00b640, 990\nN.\u00a0E. 2d, at 225. But the premise of that argument is\nincorrect: Martinez was in jeopardy, for the reasons given above.\nThe court went on to \u201cnote that, in directing findings of not\nguilty,\u201d the trial court \u201creferred to its action as a \u2018dismissal\u2019\nrather than an acquittal.\u201d Ibid. Under our precedents, however,\nthat is immaterial: \u201c[W]e have emphasized that what constitutes an\n\u2018acquittal\u2019 is not to be controlled by the form of the judge\u2019s\naction\u201d; it turns on \u201cwhether the ruling of the judge, whatever its\nlabel, actually represents a resolution .\u00a0.\u00a0. of some or\nall of the factual elements of the offense charged.\u201d Martin Linen,\n430 U.\u00a0S., at 571; see also Evans, supra, at ___ (slip op., at\n11) (\u201cOur decision turns not on the form of the trial court\u2019s\naction, but rather whether it \u2018serve[s]\u2019 substantive \u2018purposes\u2019 or\nprocedural ones\u201d); United States v. Scott,437 U.S.\n82, 96 (1978) (\u201cWe have previously noted that \u2018the trial\njudge\u2019s characterization of his own action cannot control the\nclassification of the action\u2019\u00a0\u201d).Here, as in Evans and Martin Linen, the trial\ncourt\u2019s action was an acquittal because the court \u201cacted on its\nview that the prosecution had failed to prove its case.\u201d Evans,\nsupra, at ___ (slip op., at 11); see Martin Linen, supra, at 572\n(\u201c[T]he District Court in this case evaluated the Government\u2019s\nevidence and determined that it was legally insufficient to sustain\na conviction\u201d). And because Martinez was acquitted, the State\ncannot retry him. [4]IIIThe functional rule adopted by the Illinois\nSupreme Court is not necessary to avoid unfairness to prosecutors\nor to the public. On the day of trial, the court was acutely aware\nof the significance of swearing a jury. It repeatedly delayed that\nact to give the State additional time to find its witnesses. It had\npreviously granted the State a number of continuances for the same\npurpose. See supra, at 2. And, critically, the court told the State\non the day of trial that it could \u201cmove to dismiss [its] case\u201d\nbefore the jury was sworn. Tr. 3. Had the State accepted that\ninvitation, the Double Jeopardy Clause would not have barred it\nfrom recharging Martinez. Instead, the State participated in the\nselection of jurors and did not ask for dismissal before the jury\nwas sworn. When the State declined to dismiss its case, it\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018took a chance[,] .\u00a0.\u00a0. enter[ing] upon the trial\nof the case without sufficient evidence to convict.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Downum\nv. United States,372\nU.S. 734, 737 (1963) . Here, the State knew, or should have\nknown, that an acquittal forever bars the retrial of the defendant\nwhen it occurs after jeopardy has attached. The Illinois Supreme\nCourt\u2019s holding is understandable, given the significant\nconsequence of the State\u2019s mistake, but it runs directly counter to\nour precedents and to the protection conferred by the Double\nJeopardy Clause.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*The motion for leave to proceed in forma\npauperis and the petition for a writ of certiorari are granted. The\njudgment of the Supreme Court of Illinois is reversed, and the case\nis remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this\nopinion.It is so ordered.Notes1Much of that delay was\ndue to Martinez and his counsel. See 2013 IL 113475, \u00b64, n.\u00a01,\n990 N.E.2d 215, 216, n.\u00a01 (summarizing the lengthy procedural\nhistory).2These facts are set forth\nin the opinion of the Illinois Appellate Court. 2011 IL App (2d)\n100498, \u00b6\u00b65\u20137, 969 N.E.2d 840, 842\u2013843.3Some commentators have\nsuggested that there may be limited exceptions to this rule\u2014e.g.,\nwhere the trial court lacks jurisdiction or where a defendant\nobtains an acquittal by fraud or corruption. See 6 W. LaFave, J.\nIsrael, N. King, & O. Kerr, Criminal Procedure \u00a725.1(d) (3d ed.\n2007). The scope of any such exceptions is not presented here. Nor\nneed we reach a situation where the prosecutor had no opportunity\nto dismiss the charges to avoid the consequences of empaneling the\njury. Cf. People v. Deems,81 Ill. 2d 384, 387\u2013389,410 N.E.2d 8, 10\u201311 (1980).4Indeed, even if the trial\ncourt had chosen to dismiss the case or declare a mistrial rather\nthan granting Martinez\u2019s motion for a directed verdict, the Double\nJeopardy Clause probably would still bar his retrial. We confronted\nprecisely this scenario in Downum v. United States,372\nU.S. 734(1963) , holding that once jeopardy has attached, the\nabsence of witnesses generally does not constitute the kind of\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018extraordinary and striking circumstanc[e]\u2019\u00a0\u201d in which\na trial court may exercise \u201cdiscretion to discharge the jury before\nit has reached a verdict.\u201d Id., at 736; see also Arizona v.\nWashington,434 U.S.\n497, 508, n. 24 (1978) .",
