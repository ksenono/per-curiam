    "text": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESMICHAEL DAMON RIPPO, PETITIONERv.RENEE\nBAKER, WARDENon petition for writ of certiorari to\nthesupreme court of nevadaNo. 16\u20136316.\u2003Decided March 6, 2017Per Curiam.A Nevada jury convicted petitioner Michael Damon\nRippo of first-degree murder and other offenses and sentenced him\nto death. During his trial, Rippo received information that the\njudge was the target of a federal bribery probe, and he surmised\nthat the Clark County District Attorney\u2019s Office\u2014which was\nprosecuting him\u2014was playing a role in that investigation. Rippo\nmoved for the judge\u2019s disqualification under the Due Process Clause\nof the Fourteenth Amendment, contending that a judge could not\nimpartially adjudicate a case in which one of the parties was\ncriminally investigating him. But the trial judge declined to\nrecuse himself, and (after that judge\u2019s indictment on federal\ncharges) a different judge later denied Rippo\u2019s motion for a new\ntrial. The Nevada Supreme Court affirmed on direct appeal,\nreasoning in part that Rippo had not introduced evidence that state\nauthorities were involved in the federal investigation.Rippov.State, 113 Nev. 1239, 1246\u20131250, 946\nP.\u00a02d 1017, 1023\u20131024 (1997) (per curiam).In a later application for state postconviction\nrelief, Rippo advanced his bias claim once more, this time pointing\nto documents from the judge\u2019s criminal trial indicating that the\ndistrict attorney\u2019s office had participated in the investigation of\nthe trial judge. See,e.g.,App. to Pet. for Cert. 236\u2013237,\n397. The state postconviction court denied relief, and the Nevada\nSupreme Court affirmed.Rippov.State, 132 Nev. ___,\n___, 368 P.\u00a03d 729, 743\u2013745 (2016). It likened Rippo\u2019s claim\nto the \u201ccamouflaging bias\u201d theory that this Court discussed inBracyv.Gramley, 520 U.\u00a0S. 899 (1997) . TheBracypetitioner argued that a judge who accepts bribes to\nrule in favor of some defendants would seek to disguise that\nfavorable treatment by rulingagainstdefendants who did not\nbribe him.Id.,at 905. We explained that despite the\n\u201cspeculative\u201d nature of that theory, the petitioner was entitled to\ndiscovery because he had also alleged specific facts suggesting\nthat the judge may have colluded with defense counsel to rush the\npetitioner\u2019s case to trial. Seeid.,at 905\u2013909. The Nevada\nSupreme Court reasoned that, in contrast, Rippo was not entitled to\ndiscovery or an evidentiary hearing because his allegations \u201cd[id]\nnot support the assertion that the trial judge was actually biased\nin this case.\u201d 132 Nev., at ___, 368 P.\u00a03d, at 744.[1]We vacate the Nevada Supreme Court\u2019s judgment\nbecause it applied the wrong legal standard. Under our precedents,\nthe Due Process Clause may sometimes demand recusal even when a\njudge \u201c \u2018ha[s] no actual bias.\u2019 \u201dAetna Life Ins. Co.v.Lavoie, 475 U.\u00a0S. 813, 825 (1986) . Recusal is required\nwhen, objectively speaking, \u201cthe probability of actual bias on the\npart of the judge or decisionmaker is too high to be\nconstitutionally tolerable.\u201dWithrowv.Larkin, 421\nU.\u00a0S. 35, 47 (1975) ; seeWilliamsv.Pennsylvania, 579 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at\n6) (\u201cThe Court asks not whether a judge harbors an actual,\nsubjective bias, but instead whether, as an objective matter, the\naverage judge in his position is likely to be neutral, or whether\nthere is an unconstitutional potential for bias\u201d (internal\nquotation marks omitted)). Our decision inBracyis not to\nthe contrary: Although we explained that the petitioner therehadpointed to facts suggesting actual, subjective bias, we\ndid not hold that a litigant must show as a matter of course that a\njudge was \u201cactually biased in [the litigant\u2019s] case,\u201d 132 Nev., at\n___, 368 P.\u00a03d, at 744\u2014much less that he must do so when, as\nhere, he does not allege a theory of \u201ccamouflaging bias.\u201d The\nNevada Supreme Court did not ask the question our precedents\nrequire: whether, considering all the circumstances alleged, the\nrisk of bias was too high to be constitutionally tolerable. As a\nresult, we grant the petition for writ of certiorari and the motion\nfor leave to proceedin forma pauperis, and we vacate the\njudgment below and remand the case for further proceedings not\ninconsistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.Notes1The court further relied\non its bias holding to determine that Rippo had not established\ncause and prejudice to overcome various state procedural bars. 132\nNev., at ___, 368 P. 3d, at 745. Because the court below did not\ninvoke any state-law grounds \u201cindependent of the merits of\n[Rippo\u2019s] federal constitutional challenge,\u201d we have jurisdiction\nto review its resolution of federal law.Fosterv.Chatman, 578 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at\n8).",
