S. ____ (2010)SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESLAWRENCE JOSEPH JEFFERSONv.STEPHEN\nUPTON, WARDENon petition for writ of certiorari to the united\nstates court of appeals for the eleventh circuitNo. 09\u20138852.\u2003Decided May 24, 2010Per Curiam.Petitioner Lawrence Jefferson,\nwho has been sentenced to death, claimed in both state and federal\ncourts that his lawyers were constitutionally inadequate because\nthey failed to investigate a traumatic head injury that he suffered\nas a child. The state court rejected that claim after making a\nfinding that the attorneys were advised by an expert that such\ninvestigation was unnecessary. Under the governing federal statute,\nthat factual finding is presumed correct unless any one of eight\nexceptions applies. See 28 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a72254(d)(1)\u2013(8) (1994\ned.). But the Court of Appeals considered only one of those\nexceptions (specifically \u00a72254(d)(8)). And on that basis, it\nconsidered itself \u201cduty-bound\u201d to accept the state court\u2019s finding,\nand rejected Jefferson\u2019s claim. Because the Court of Appeals did\nnot fully consider several remaining potentially applicable\nexceptions, we vacate its judgment and remand.IWhen Jefferson was a child, he\n\u201csuffered a serious injury to his head.\u201dJeffersonv.Terry,490 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d 1261, 1326 (ND Ga. 2007); seeid.,at 1320 (quoting Jefferson\u2019s mother\u2019s testimony that\n\u201ca car ran over the top of his head\u201d when he was two years old).\nThe accident left his skull swollen and misshapen and his forehead\nvisibly scarred.Jeffersonv.Hall,570\nF.\u00a03d 1283, 1311, 1315, n.\u00a04 (CA11 2009) (Carnes, J.,\ndissenting). During the District Court proceedings below,\nuncontroverted experts testified that, as a result of his head\ninjury, Jefferson has \u201cpermanent brain damage\u201d that \u201ccauses\nabnormal behavior\u201d over which he \u201chas no or substantially limited\ncontrol.\u201d 490 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d, at 1321\u20131322. According to these\nexperts, Jefferson\u2019s condition causes \u201c\u00a0\u2018emotional\ndullness,\u2019\u00a0\u201d \u201c\u00a0\u2018restless or aggressive\ncharacteristics,\u2019\u00a0\u201d \u201c\u00a0\u2018impulsiveness,\u2019\u00a0\u201d\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018temper outbursts,\u2019\u00a0\u201d \u201c\u00a0\u2018markedly diminished\nimpulse control,\u2019\u00a0\u201d \u201c\u00a0\u2018impaired social judgment,\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nand \u201c\u00a0\u2018transient outbursts of rage which are totally\ninconsistent with his normal behavioral pattern.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId.,at 1322, 1327.The experts further testified\nthat Jefferson\u2019s \u201c\u00a0\u2018severe cognitive disabilities\u2019\u00a0\u201d\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018profoundly alter\u2019\u00a0\u201d his \u201c\u00a0\u2018ability to plan and\ncoordinate his actions, to be aware of the consequences of his\nbehavior, and to engage in premeditated or intentional\nacts.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId.,at 1327. But they testified he is\nneither psychotic nor retarded.Id.,at 1319. Thus, they\nsaid, to a lay observer or even to a professional psychologist,\nJefferson does not outwardly appear mentally impaired. Indeed,\naccording to the experts, \u201c\u00a0\u2018the behavior that may result\nfrom\u2019\u00a0\u201d his condition \u201c\u00a0\u2018could, without the\nadministration of proper testing, be mistaken for\nvolitional.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId.,at 1322.Jefferson faced a death sentence for killing\nhis co-worker while the two men were fishing.Id.,at\n1271\u20131272. Prior to trial, he was examined by a psychologist named\nDr. Gary Dudley, who prepared a formal report in which he concluded\nthat Jefferson\u2019s mental deficiencies do not impair \u201c\u00a0\u2018his\njudgment or decision-making capacity.\u2019\u00a0\u201d 570 F.\u00a03d, at\n1294 (quoting report). But Dr. Dudley\u2019s report included a caveat:\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018One possibility that could not be explored because of\n[Jefferson\u2019s] incarceration has to do with the sequelae,\u2019\u00a0\u201di.e.,pathologies, related to a \u201c\u00a0\u2018head injury\nexperienced during childhood.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIbid.\u201c\u00a0\u2018In my\nopinion,\u2019\u00a0\u201d he wrote, \u201c\u00a0\u2018it would be worthwhile to\nconduct neuropsychological evaluation of this individual to rule\nout an organic etiology,\u2019\u00a0\u201di.e.,to rule out brain\ndamage.Ibid.Although \u201cit is undisputed that the testing\u201d\nDr. Dudley recommended \u201ccould have easily been performed,\u201d 490\nF.\u00a0Supp. 2d, at 1322, and that Jefferson\u2019s attorneys possessed\npolice reports and hospital records recounting his head injury,id.,at 1323, the attorneys did not have Jefferson tested.\nAt sentencing, they presented only testimony from two prison\nguards, who stated that Jefferson was an unproblematic inmate, and\nfrom three members of Jefferson\u2019s family, who testified that he is\na \u201cresponsible, generous, gentle, and kind\u201d person and \u201ca good\nfather.\u201d 570 F.\u00a03d, at 1290\u20131291. And while Jefferson\u2019s mother\nbriefly mentioned the car accident, \u201cshe was not questioned and did\nnot offer any testimony regarding the impact, if any, that the\naccident had on him.\u201dId.,at 1291. Thus, \u201c[a]s far as the\njury knew, Jefferson did not suffer from brain damage or\nneurological impairment; he had no organic disorders\u201d; and \u201chis\nemotional stability, impulse control, and judgment were perfectly\nnormal.\u201dId.,at 1311 (Carnes, J., dissenting).Jefferson sought habeas relief in state court,\narguing that his two trial attorneys unreasonably failed to pursue\nbrain-damage testing. In response, the trial attorneys testified\nthat they did not pursue such testing because, after delivering his\nformal written report, Dr. Dudley later told them that further\ninvestigation \u201c\u00a0\u2018may be a waste of time because the rest of\n[his] report\u2019\u00a0\u201d had \u201c\u00a0\u2018said that [Jefferson] was non\npsychotic.\u2019\u00a0\u201d 570 F.\u00a03d, at 1295 (quoting testimony). Dr.\nDudley did not testify in person at the hearing, but he submitted a\nsworn affidavit denying that he had ever made such statements. He\nsaid \u201cit had always been his expert opinion \u2018that\nneuropsychological testing was necessary\u2019\u00a0\u201d and that when he\nwrote as much in his formal report \u201che \u2018meant it.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId.,at 1312 (Carnes, J., dissenting) (quoting affidavit).\nHe added, \u201c\u00a0\u2018I never, before or after that report, suggested\nto [Jefferson\u2019s attorneys] that such an evaluation was not\nnecessary or that it would not be worthwhile.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIbid.;cf. Pet. for Cert. 17, n.\u00a012.Jefferson contends, and the State has not\ndisputed, that after the hearing concluded the state-court judge\ncontacted the attorneys for the Stateex parte.And in a\nprivate conversation that included neither Jefferson nor his\nattorneys, the judge asked the State\u2019s attorneys to draft the\nopinion of the court. Seeid., at 3, 12. According to\nJefferson, no such request was made of him, nor was he informed of\nthe request made to opposing counsel.Id.,at 12,\nn.\u00a08, 13; see alsoJeffersonv.Zant, 263\nGa. 316, 431 S.\u00a0E.\u00a02d 110, 111 (1993) (\u201cJefferson\ncontends [the order] amounts to no more and no less than a reply\nbrief to which [he] has not had a chance to respond\u201d).The attorneys for the State prepared an\nopinion finding that \u201cDr. Dudley led [Jefferson\u2019s trial attorneys]\nto believe that further investigation would simply be a waste of\ntime because Petitioner [i]s not psychotic.\u201dJeffersonv.Zant, Civ. Action No. 87\u2013V\u20131241 (Super. Ct. Butts Cty.,\nGa., Oct. 7, 1992), p.\u00a016, App. 4 to Pet. for Cert. 16\n(hereinafter State Order); see alsoid.,at 37. The\nopinion \u201cspecifically credits the testimony of [the trial\nattorneys] with regard to their efforts to investigate Petitioner\u2019s\nmental condition.\u201dId.,at 18; see alsoid.,at\n36. And relying on these findings, it concludes that Jefferson\u2019s\nattorneys \u201cmade a reasonable investigation into [his] mental\nhealth\u201d and were thus not ineffective.Id.,at 37.Notably, as the Georgia Supreme Court\nacknowledged, the State\u2019s opinion discusses statements purportedly\nmade on Jefferson\u2019s behalf by a witness \u201cwho did not testify\u201d or\nparticipate in the proceedings. 263 Ga., at 318, 431 S.\u00a0E. 2d,\nat 112; see State Order 24\u201325. Nonetheless, the opinion \u201cwas\nadopted verbatim by the [state] court.\u201d 263 Ga., at 316, 431\nS.\u00a0E. 2d, at 111. And while the State Supreme Court recognized\nthat we have \u201c\u00a0\u2018criticized\u2019\u00a0\u201d such a practice, it\naffirmed the judgment.Id.,at 317, 320, 431 S.\u00a0E.\n2d, at 112, 114 (quotingAndersonv.Bessemer\nCity,470 U. S.\n564, 572 (1985)).IIJefferson next sought federal\nhabeas relief in the District Court. In his opening brief, he\nargued that \u201cthere is no reason under principles of comity or\notherwise to give any deference to the findings of the State Habeas\nCorpus Court.\u201d Brief for Petitioner in No. 1:96\u2013CV\u2013989\u2013CC (ND Ga.),\nDoc. 105, p.\u00a04, and n.\u00a01 (hereinafter District Court\nBrief). In support of that argument, he claimed that the state\ncourt \u201cmerely signed an order drafted by the State without revision\nof a single word,\u201d even though the order \u201cdescribed witnesses who\nnever testified.\u201dIbid.And he said that such a process\n\u201crais[es] serious doubts as to whether [the judge] even read, much\nless carefully considered, the proposed order submitted by the\nState.\u201dIbid.The District Court ruled in\nJefferson\u2019s favor. It noted that under the relevant statute\n\u201cfactual findings of state courts are presumed to be correct unless\none of \u2026 eight enumerated exceptions \u2026 applies.\u201d 490 F.\u00a0Supp.\n2d, at 1280; see also id.,at 1280, n.\u00a05 (listing the\nexceptions). And it acknowledged \u201cthe state habeas corpus court\u2019s\nfailure to explain the basis\u201d for its credibility findings.Id.,at 1324, n.\u00a017. But it accepted Jefferson\u2019s\nclaim of ineffective assistance of counsel without disturbing the\nstate court\u2019s factual findings because it believed he should\nprevail even accepting those findings as true.Id.,at\n1324\u20131325.On appeal, Jefferson defended the District\nCourt\u2019s judgment primarily on its own terms. But he also argued\nthat the state court\u2019s factfinding was \u201cdubious at best\u201d in light\nof the process that court employed, and that the Court of Appeals\ntherefore \u201cshould harbor serious doubts about the findings of fact\nand credibility determinations in the state court record.\u201d Brief\nfor Petitioner/Appellee in No. 07\u201312502 (CA11), pp. 31\u201332,\nn.\u00a010 (hereinafter Appeals Brief).A divided Court of Appeals panel reversed, and\nJefferson filed this petition for certiorari asking us to review\nhis claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. And, in so doing,\nhe challenges\u2014as he did in the State Supreme Court, the District\nCourt, and the Court of Appeals\u2014\u201cthe fact findings of the state\ncourt,\u201d given what he describes as the deficient procedure employed\nby that court while reviewing his claim. Pet. for Cert. 11\u201313, 17,\nn.\u00a012, 18, n.\u00a013 (recounting \u201c\u00a0\u2018reason[s] to\ndoubt\u2019\u00a0\u201d the state court\u2019s findings). Cf.Lebronv.National Railroad Passenger Corporation,513 U. S. 374, 379\n(1995) (stating standard for preserving an issue for review in this\nCourt).IIIThis habeas application was filed\nprior to the enactment of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death\nPenalty Act of 1996 and is therefore governed by federal habeas law\nas it existed prior to that point.Lindhv.Murphy,521\nU. S. 320, 326\u2013336 (1997). In 1963, we set forth the\n\u201cappropriate standard\u201d to be applied by a \u201cfederal court in habeas\ncorpus\u201d when \u201cthe facts\u201d pertinent to a habeas application \u201care in\ndispute.\u201dTownsendv.Sain,372 U. S. 293, 312. We\nheld that when \u201cthe habeas applicant was afforded a full and fair\nhearing by the state court resulting in reliable findings\u201d the\ndistrict court \u201cordinarily should \u2026 accept the facts as found\u201d by\nthe state-court judge.Id.,at 318. However, \u201cif the\nhabeas applicant did not receive a full and fair evidentiary\nhearing in a state court, either at the time of the trial or in a\ncollateral proceeding,\u201d we held that the federal court \u201cmust hold\nan evidentiary hearing\u201d to resolve any facts that \u201care in dispute.\u201dId.,at 312. We further \u201cexplain[ed] the controlling\ncriteria\u201d by enumerating six circumstances in which such an\nevidentiary hearing would be required:\u201c(1) the merits of the factual dispute were not\nresolved in the state hearing; (2) the state factual determination\nis not fairly supported by the record as a whole; (3)the\nfact-finding procedureemployed by the state courtwas not\nadequate to afford a full and fair hearing; (4) there is a\nsubstantial allegation of newly discovered evidence; (5) the\nmaterial facts were not adequately developed at the state-court\nhearing; or (6)for any reason it appears that the state trier\nof fact did not afford the habeas applicant a full and fair fact\nhearing.\u201dId.,at 313 (emphasis added).Three years later, in 1966,\nCongress enacted an amendment to the federal habeas statute that\n\u201cwas an almost verbatim codification of the standards delineated inTownsendv.Sain.\u201dMillerv.Fenton,474\nU. S. 104, 111 (1985). That codification read in relevant part\nas follows:\u201cIn any proceeding instituted in\na Federal court by an application for a writ of habeas corpus by a\nperson in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court, a\ndetermination \u2026 of a factual issue, made by a State court of\ncompetent jurisdiction \u2026 , shall be presumed to be correct,unlessthe applicant shall establish or it shall otherwise\nappear, or the respondent shall admit\u2014\u201c(1) that the merits of the factual dispute\nwere not resolved in the State court hearing;\u201c(2)that the factfinding procedure\nemployed by the State court was not adequate to afford a full and\nfair hearing;\u201c(3) that the material facts were not\nadequately developed at the State court hearing;\u201c(4) that the State court lacked jurisdiction\nof the subject matter or over the person of the applicant in the\nState court proceeding;\u201c(5) that the applicant was an indigent and\nthe State court, in deprivation of his constitutional right, failed\nto appoint counsel to represent him in the State court\nproceeding;\u201c(6)that the applicant did not receive a\nfull, fair, and adequate hearing in the State court proceeding;\nor\u201c(7)that the applicant was otherwise\ndenied due process of law in the State court proceeding;\u201c(8)or unless \u2026 the Federal court on\na consideration of [the relevant] part of the record as a whole\nconcludes that such factual determinationis not fairly\nsupported by the record.\u201d \u00a72254(d) (emphasis added).As is clear from the statutory text quoted above,\nand as the District Court correctly stated, if any \u201cone of the\neight enumerated exceptions \u2026 applies\u201d then \u201cthe state court\u2019s\nfactfinding is not presumed correct.\u201d 490 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d, at\n1280; accord,Miller, supra,at 105 (\u201cUnder 28 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a72254(d), state-court findings of fact \u2018shall be\npresumed to be correct\u2019 in a federal habeas corpus proceeding\nunless one of eight enumerated exceptions applies\u201d); see also 1 R.\nHertz & J. Liebman, Federal Habeas Corpus Practice and\nProcedure \u00a720.2c, pp. 915\u2013918 (5th ed. 2005).Jefferson has consistently argued that the\nfederal courts \u201cshould harbor serious doubts about\u201d and should not\n\u201cgive any deference to\u201d the \u201cfindings of fact and credibility\ndeterminations\u201d made by the state habeas court because those\nfindings were drafted exclusively by the attorneys for the State\npursuant to anex parterequest from the state-court\njudge, who made no such request of Jefferson, failed to notify\nJefferson of the request made to opposing counsel, and adopted the\nState\u2019s proposed opinion verbatim even though it recounted evidence\nfrom a nonexistent witness. See,e.g.,Appeals Brief 32,\nn.\u00a010; District Court Brief 4, n.\u00a01; Pet. for Cert. 12.\nThese are arguments that the state court\u2019sprocesswas\ndeficient. In other words, they are arguments that Jefferson \u201cdid\nnot receive a full and fair evidentiary hearing in \u2026 state court.\u201dTownsend, supra,at 312. Or, to use the statutory\nlanguage, they are arguments that the state court\u2019s \u201cfactfinding\nprocedure,\u201d \u201chearing,\u201d and \u201cproceeding\u201d were not \u201cfull, fair, and\nadequate.\u201d \u00a7\u00a72254(d)(2), (6), (7).But the Court of Appeals did not consider the\nstate court\u2019s process when it applied the statutory presumption of\ncorrectness. Instead, it invoked Circuit precedent that applied\nonly paragraph (8) of \u00a72254(d), which, codifying the secondTownsendexception, 372 U. S., at 313, lifts the\npresumption of correctness for findings that are \u201cnot fairly\nsupported by the record.\u201d See 570 F.\u00a03d, at 1300 (quotingJacksonv.Herring, 42 F.\u00a03d 1350, 1366\n(CA11 1995), in turn quoting 28 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a72254(d)(8)). And\neven though the Court of Appeals \u201crecognize[d]\u201d that Jefferson had\nargued that the state court\u2019sprocesshad produced factual\nfindings that were \u201c\u00a0\u2018dubious at best,\u2019\u00a0\u201d and that\nfederal courts should therefore \u201c\u00a0\u2018harbor serious doubts\nabout\u2019\u00a0\u201d the state court\u2019s \u201c\u00a0\u2018findings of fact and\ncredibility,\u2019\u00a0\u201d the Court of Appeals nonetheless held that the\nstate court\u2019s findings are \u201c\u00a0\u2018entitled to a presumption of\ncorrectness\u2019\u00a0\u201d that it was \u201cduty-bound\u201d to apply. 570\nF.\u00a03d, at 1304, n.\u00a08 (quoting Appeals Brief 32,\nn.\u00a010). The Court of Appeals explicitly stated that it\nconsidered itself \u201cduty-bound\u201d to defer to the state court\u2019s\nfindings because \u201cJefferson has not argued that any of the state\ncourts\u2019 factual findings were \u2018not fairly supported by the\nrecord,\u2019\u00a0\u201d a direct reference to \u00a72254(d)(8) and to the\nsecondTownsendexception. 570 F.\u00a03d, at 1304,\nn.\u00a08 (emphasis added). And it then concluded: \u201cBased on these\nfactual findings of the state habeas courts\u2014all of which arefairly supported by the record\u2014we believe that Jefferson\u2019s\ncounsel were reasonable in deciding not to pursue\nneuropsychological testing.\u201dId.,at 1304 (emphasis\nadded).In our view, the Court of Appeals did not\nproperly consider the legal status of the state court\u2019s factual\nfindings. UnderTownsend, as codified by the governing\nstatute, a federal court is not \u201cduty-bound\u201d to accept any and all\nstate-court findings that are \u201cfairly supported by the record.\u201d\nThose words come from \u00a72254(d)(8), which is only one of eight\nenumerated exceptions to the presumption of correctness. But there\nare seven others, see \u00a7\u00a72254(d)(1)\u2013(7), none of which the Court of\nAppeals considered when addressing Jefferson\u2019s claim. To be sure,\nwe have previously stated in casesapplying\u00a72254(d)(8)\nthat \u201ca federal court\u201d may not overturn a state court\u2019s factual\nconclusion \u201cunless the conclusion is not \u2018fairly supported by the\nrecord.\u2019\u00a0\u201dParkerv.Dugger,498 U. S. 308, 320\n(1991) (granting federal habeas relief after rejecting state\ncourt\u2019s finding under \u00a72254(d)(8)); see alsoDemosthenesv.Baal,495 U. S. 731(1990)(per curiam)(applying \u00a72254(d)(8)); cf.post,at\n10 (Scalia, J., dissenting). But in those cases there was no\nsuggestion that anyotherprovisions enumerated in\n\u00a72254(d) were at issue. That is not the case here. In treating\n\u00a72254(d)(8) as theexclusivestatutory exception, and by\nfailing to address Jefferson\u2019s argument that the state court\u2019sproceduresdeprived its findings of deference, the Court\nof Appeals applied the statute and our precedents incorrectly.Although we have stated that a court\u2019s\n\u201cverbatim adoption of findings of fact prepared by prevailing\nparties\u201d should be treated as findings of the court, we have also\ncriticized that practice.Anderson, 470 U. S., at 572. And\nwe have not considered the lawfulness of, nor the application of\nthe habeas statute to, the use of such a practice where (1) a judge\nsolicits the proposed findingsex parte, (2) does not\nprovide the opposing party an opportunity to criticize the findings\nor to submit his own, or (3) adopts findings that contain internal\nevidence suggesting that the judge may not have read them. Cf.id.,at 568; Ga. Code of Judicial Conduct, Canon 3(A)(4)\n(1993) (prohibitingex partejudicial communications).We decline to determine in the first instance\nwhether any of the exceptions enumerated in \u00a7\u00a72254(d)(1)\u2013(8) apply\nin this case, see,e.g.,Cutterv.Wilkinson,544 U. S. 709, 718,\nn.\u00a07 (2005), especially given that the facts surrounding the\nstate habeas court\u2019s process are undeveloped. Respondent has\nconceded that it drafted the state court\u2019s final order at that\ncourt\u2019s request and that the order was adopted verbatim, 263 Ga.,\nat 317, 431 S.\u00a0E. 2d, at 111, and has not disputed in this\nCourt that the state court solicited the order \u201cex parteand without prior notice\u201d and \u201cdid not seek a proposed order from\nPetitioner,\u201d Pet. for Cert. 12, and n.\u00a08. But the precise\nnature of what transpired during the state-court proceedings is not\nfully known. See 263 Ga. at 316\u2013317, 431 S.\u00a0E. 2d, at 111\n(noting dispute as to whether Jefferson \u201chad a chance to respond\u201d\nto the final order); see also Pet. for Cert. 13.Accordingly, we believe it necessary for the\nlower courts to determine on remand whether the state court\u2019s\nfactual findings warrant a presumption of correctness, and to\nconduct any further proceedings as may be appropriate in light of\ntheir resolution of that issue. SeeTownsend, supra,at\n313\u2013319;Keeneyv.Tamayo-Reyes,504 U. S. 1(1992). In so\nholding, we express no opinion as to whether Jefferson\u2019s Sixth\nAmendment rights were violated assuming the state court\u2019s factual\nfindings to be true.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*The petition for a writ of\ncertiorari and motion to proceedin forma pauperisare\ngranted. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the\ncase is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this\nopinion.It is so ordered.",
