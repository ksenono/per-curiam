GONZALES, ATTORNEY GENERALv.MICHELLE THOMAS et\u00a0al.on petition for writ of certiorari to the united\nstates court of appeals for the ninth circuitNo. 05\u2013552.\u2003Decided April 17, 2006Per Curiam.The Immigration and Nationality\nAct authorizes the Attorney General to grant an alien asylum if the\nalien cannot return to another country because of \u201cpersecution or a\nwell-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion,\nnationality,membership in a particular social group,or\npolitical opinion.\u201d \u00a7101(a)(42)(A), as added, \u00a7201, 94 Stat. 102, 8\nU. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71101(a)(42)(A) (emphasis added). The respondents,\nMichelle Thomas and her immediate family, applied for asylum. They\nchecked boxes on the application form that indicated their claim\nrested upon fear of persecution in their native South Africa\nbecause of (1) their \u201cpolitical opinion[s],\u201d and (2) their\n\u201cmembership in a particular social group.\u201d In proceedings before\nthe Immigration Judge, they emphasized their fear of persecution\nbecause of their race (they are white) and their kinship with\nMichelle\u2019s father-in-law, \u201cBoss Ronnie,\u201d a white South African who\nallegedly held racist views and mistreated black workers at the\ncompany at which he was a foreman. The Immigration Judge, focusing\nupon questions of race and political views, rejected their claim.\nAnd the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), responding to the\nThomases\u2019 primarily race-related arguments, summarily affirmed that\ndecision.On review, a Ninth Circuit panel held by a\n2-to-1 vote that the Board had not adequately considered the\nThomases\u2019 claim of persecution because of \u201cmembership in a\nparticular social group, as relatives of Boss Ronnie.\u201dThomasv.Ashcroft, 359 F.\u00a03d 1169, 1177\n(2004). The Ninth Circuit took the matter en banc. The en banc\ncourt, overruling what it considered aberrant contrary Circuit\nprecedent, unanimously held that in principle \u201ca familymayconstitute a social group for the purposes of the\nrefugee statutes.\u201d 409 F.\u00a03d 1177, 1187 (2005) (en banc)\n(emphasis added) (overruling,inter alia,Estrada-Posadasv.INS, 924 F.\u00a02d 916 (CA9\n1991)). In so doing, the court relied on earlier BIA opinions\nholding that certain \u201ckinship ties\u201d fall within the statutory term.\nSeeid., at 1180, 1184-1186.The court then went on to hold, over the\ndissent of four judges, that the particular family at issue, namely\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018persons related to Boss Ronnie,\u2019\u00a0\u201d fell within the\nscope of the statutory term \u201cparticular social group\u201d and that the\n\u201cThomases were attacked and threatened because they belonged to the\nparticular social group of \u2018persons related to Boss\nRonnie\u2019\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d 409 F.\u00a03d, at 1189. The dissenting\njudges argued that the question \u201cwhether the Thomasesarea \u2018particular social group\u2019\u00a0\u201d should first be considered by\nthe relevant administrative agency.Id., at 1193 (opinion\nof Rymer, J.) (emphasis in original). And they said that the\nmajority\u2019s contrary decision was inconsistent with this Court\u2019s\nholding inINSv.Orlando Ventura,537 U. S. 12, 18 (2002)(per curiam).The Solicitor General now asks us to grant\ncertiorari to consider whether the Ninth Circuit \u201cerred in holding,\nin the first instance and without prior resolution of the questions\nby the\u201d relevant administrative agency, \u201cthat members of a family\ncan and do constitute a \u2018particular social group\u2019 within the\nmeaning of\u201d the Act. Pet. for Cert. I. He argues that a court\u2019s\nrole in an immigration case is typically one of \u201c\u00a0\u2018review, not\nof first view.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId., at 29 (quotingCutterv.Wilkinson,544 U. S. 709, 718, n. 7\n(2005)). He adds that the decision clearly violates what this Court\ndescribed inVenturaas the \u201cordinary \u2018remand\u2019 rule.\u201d Pet.\nfor Cert. 15 (quotingVentura,supra, at 18). And\nhe concludes that \u201cthe Ninth Circuit\u2019s error is so obvious in light\nofVenturathat summary reversal would be appropriate.\u201d\nPet. for Cert. 29.We agree with the Solicitor General. The Ninth\nCircuit\u2019s failure to remand is legally erroneous, and that error is\n\u201cobvious in light ofVentura,\u201d itself a summary\nreversal.The alien inVenturasought asylum on\ngrounds of a reasonable fear of \u201cpersecution\u201d in Guatemala\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018on account of \u2026 [a] political opinion.\u2019\u00a0\u201d 537 U. S.,\nat 13. The BIA held that the alien did not qualify for asylum\nbecause whatever persecution he faced when he left Guatemala in\n1993 was not on account of a \u201c\u00a0\u2018political opinion.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIbid. The Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that the record\nshowed that in 1993 the alien did indeed face politically based\npersecution in Guatemala. The Circuit then went on to consider the\nGovernment\u2019s alternative argument\u2014that, in any event, conditions\nwithin Guatemala had improved to the point that political\npersecution was no longer likely.Ibid. And the Circuit\nrejected this \u201c\u00a0\u2018changed circumstances\u2019\u00a0\u201d claim without\nfirst giving the agency an opportunity to consider the matter.Id., at 14.We reversed the Ninth Circuit summarily. We\npointed out that \u201c[w]ithin broad limits the law entrusts the agency\nto make the basic asylum eligibility decision.\u201dId., at\n16. \u201cIn such circumstances,\u201d we added, a \u201c\u00a0\u2018judicial judgment\ncannot be made to do service for an administrative\njudgment.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIbid. (quotingSECv.Chenery Corp.,318 U. S. 80, 88 (1943)).\n\u201cA court of appeals \u2018is not generally empowered to conduct ade\nnovoinquiry into the matter being reviewed and to reach its\nown conclusions based on such an inquiry.\u2019\u00a0\u201dVentura,supra, at 16 (quotingFlorida Power & Light\nCo.v.Lorion,470 U. S. 729, 744\n(1985)). \u201cRather, \u2018the proper course, except in rare circumstances,\nis to remand to the agency for additional investigation or\nexplanation.\u2019\u00a0\u201dVentura,supra, at 16\n(quotingFlorida Power & Light Co.,supra, at\n744; citingSECv.Chenery Corp., 332 U. S.194,\n196 (1947)). Applying these \u201cbasic legal principles,\u201d we concluded\nthat \u201cevery consideration that classically supports the law\u2019s\nordinary remand requirement does so here.\u201dVentura, 537 U.\nS., at 16, 17.We must reach the same conclusion in the\npresent case. The agency has not yet considered whether Boss\nRonnie\u2019s family presents the kind of \u201ckinship ties\u201d that constitute\na \u201cparticular social group.\u201d The matter requires determining the\nfacts and deciding whether the facts as found fall within a\nstatutory term. And as we said inVentura:\u201cThe agency can bring its expertise to bear\nupon the matter; it can evaluate the evidence; it can make an\ninitial determination; and, in doing so, it can, through informed\ndiscussion and analysis, help a court later determine whether its\ndecision exceeds the leeway that the law provides.\u201d Id., at\n17.We can find no special\ncircumstance here that might have justified the Ninth Circuit\u2019s\ndetermination of the matter in the first instance. Thus, as inVentura,the Court of Appeals should have applied the\n\u201cordinary \u2018remand\u2019 rule.\u201dId., at 18.We grant the petition for certiorari. We\nvacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals. And we remand the case\nfor further proceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.",
