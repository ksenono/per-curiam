The temporary stay entered byJusticeGinsburgon June 8, 2009, is\nvacated.A denial of a stay is not a decision on\nthe merits of the underlying legal issues. In determining whether\nto grant a stay, we consider instead whether the applicant has\ndemonstrated \u201c(1) a reasonable probability that four Justices will\nconsider the issue sufficiently meritorious to grant certiorari or\nto note probable jurisdiction; (2) a fair prospect that a majority\nof the Court will conclude that the decision below was erroneous;\nand (3) a likelihood that irreparable harm will result from the\ndenial of a stay.\u201dConkrightv.Fommert, 556\nU.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 1\u20132)\n(Ginsburg, J., in chambers) (internal quotation marks\nand alterations omitted).

It is instead an exercise of\njudicial discretion, and the \u201cparty requesting a stay bears the\nburden of showing that the circumstances justify an exercise of\nthat discretion.\u201dIbid. The applicants have not carried that\nburden.\u201c[T]he propriety of [a stay] is\ndependent upon the circumstances of the particular case,\u201d and the\n\u201ctraditional stay factors contemplate individualized judgments in\neach case.\u201dIbid.(internal quotation marks omitted). Our\nassessment of the stay factors here is based on the record and\nproceedings in this case alone.",
