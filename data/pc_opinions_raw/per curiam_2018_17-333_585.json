JOHN BENISEK, et\u00a0al., APPELLANTSv.LINDA H. LAMONE, ADMINISTRATOR, MARYLAND STATE BOARD OF\nELECTIONS, et\u00a0al.on appeal from the united states district\ncourt for the district of maryland[June 18, 2018]Per Curiam.This appeal arises from the denial of a motion\nfor a preliminary injunction in the District Court. Appellants are\nseveral Republican voters, plaintiffs below, who allege that\nMaryland\u2019s Sixth Congressional District was gerrymandered in 2011\nfor the purpose of retaliating against them for their political\nviews.In May 2017, six years after the Maryland\nGeneral Assembly redrew the Sixth District, plaintiffs moved the\nDistrict Court to enjoin Maryland\u2019s election officials from holding\ncongressional elections under the 2011 map. They asserted that\n\u201cextend[ing] this constitutional offense\u201d\u2014i.e.,the alleged\ngerrymander\u2014\u201cinto the 2018 election would be a manifest and\nirreparable injury.\u201d Record in No. 1:13\u2013cv\u20133233, Doc. 177\u20131,\np.\u00a03. In order to allow time for the creation of a new\ndistricting map, plaintiffs urged the District Court to enter a\npreliminary injunction by August 18, 2017.Id.,at 32.On August 24, 2017, the District Court denied\nplaintiffs\u2019 motion and stayed further proceedings pending this\nCourt\u2019s disposition of partisan gerrymandering claims inGillv.Whitford, No. 16\u20131161. 266\nF.\u00a0Supp.\u00a03d 799. The District Court found that plaintiffs\nhad failed to show a likelihood of success on the merits sufficient\nto warrant a preliminary injunction.Id.,at 808\u2013814. The\nDistrict Court also held that it was \u201cin no position to award\n[p]laintiffs the remedy they .\u00a0.\u00a0. requested on the\ntimetable they .\u00a0.\u00a0. demanded.\u201dId.,at 815. The\ncourt explained that, notwithstanding its \u201cdiligence in ruling on\nthe pending preliminary injunction motion (which has been a\npriority for each member of this panel),\u201d plaintiffs\u2019 proposed\nAugust deadline for injunctive relief had \u201calready come and gone.\u201dIbid.In addition, the District Court emphasized that\nit was concerned about \u201cmeasuring the legality and\nconstitutionality of any redistricting plan in Maryland\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. according to the proper legal standard.\u201dId.,at 816. In the District Court\u2019s view, it would be\n\u201cbetter equipped to make that legal determination and to chart a\nwise course for further proceedings\u201d after this Court issued a\ndecision inGill.Ibid.Plaintiffs ask this Court to\nvacate the District Court\u2019s order and remand for further\nconsideration of whether a preliminary injunction is\nappropriate.We now note our jurisdiction and review the\nDistrict Court\u2019s decision for an abuse of discretion, keeping in\nmind that a preliminary injunction is \u201can extraordinary remedy\nnever awarded as of right.\u201dWinterv.Natural Resources\nDefense Council, Inc., 555 U.\u00a0S. 7, 24 (2008). As a matter\nof equitable discretion, a preliminary injunction does not follow\nas a matter of course from a plaintiff\u2019s showing of a likelihood of\nsuccess on the merits.See id.,at 32. Rather, a court must\nalso consider whether the mov-ant has shown \u201cthat he is likely to\nsuffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, that\nthe balance of equities tips in his favor, and that an injunction\nis in the public interest.\u201dId.,at 20.Plaintiffs made no such showing below. Even if\nwe assume\u2014contrary to the findings of the District Court\u2014that\nplaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their claims,\nthe balance of equities and the public interest tilted against\ntheir request for a preliminary injunction.First, a party requesting a preliminary\ninjunction must generally show reasonable diligence. Cf.Holmbergv.Armbrecht, 327 U.\u00a0S. 392, 396\n(1946). That is as true in election law cases as elsewhere. SeeLucasv.Townsend, 486 U.\u00a0S. 1301, 1305 (1988)\n(Kennedy, J., in chambers);Fishmanv.Schaffer, 429\nU.\u00a0S. 1325, 1330 (1976) (Marshall, J., in chambers). In this\ncase, appellants did not move for a preliminary injunction in the\nDistrict Court until six years, and three general elections, after\nthe 2011 map was adopted, and over three years after the\nplaintiffs\u2019 first complaint was filed.Plaintiffs argue that they have nevertheless\npursued their claims diligently, and they attribute their delay in\nseeking a preliminary injunction to the \u201cconvoluted procedural\nhistory of the case\u201d and the \u201cdogged refusal to cooperate in\ndiscovery\u201d by state officials. Reply Brief 22. Yet the record\nsuggests that the delay largely arose from a circumstance within\nplaintiffs\u2019 control: namely, their failure to plead the claims\ngiving rise to their request for preliminary injunctive relief\nuntil 2016. Although one of the seven plaintiffs before us filed a\ncomplaint in 2013 alleging that Maryland\u2019s congressional map was an\nunconstitutional gerrymander, that initial complaint did not\npresent the retaliation theory asserted here. See Amended\nComplaint, Doc. 11, p.\u00a03 (Dec. 2, 2013) (explaining that the\ngerrymandering claim did not turn upon \u201cthe reason or intent of the\nlegislature\u201d in adopting the map).It was not until 2016 that the remaining\nplaintiffs joined the case and filed an amended complaint alleging\nthat Maryland officials intentionally retaliated against them\nbecause of their political views. See 3 App. 640\u2013643. Plaintiffs\u2019\nnewly presented claims\u2014unlike the gerrymandering claim presented in\nthe 2013 complaint\u2014required discovery into the motives of the\nofficials who produced the 2011 congressional map. See,e.g.,Memorandum of Law in Support of Plaintiffs\u2019 Motion to\nCompel, Doc. 111\u20131, p.\u00a03 (Jan. 4, 2017) (describing\nplaintiffs\u2019 demand that various state officials \u201ctestify\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. and answer questions concerning legislative\nintent\u201d). It is true that the assertion of legislative privilege by\nthose officials delayed the completion of that discovery. See Joint\nMotion To Extend Deadlines for Completion of Fact Discovery and\nExpert Witness Disclosures, Doc. 161, pp.\u00a01\u20132 (Mar. 3, 2017);\nJoint Motion To Extend Deadlines for Completion of Fact Discovery\nand Expert Witness Disclosures, Doc. 170, pp.\u00a01\u20132 (Mar. 27,\n2017). But that does not change the fact that plaintiffs could have\nsought a preliminary injunction much earlier. SeeFishman,supra, at 1330. In considering the balance of equities among\nthe parties, we think that plaintiffs\u2019 unnecessary, years-long\ndelay in asking for preliminary injunctive relief weighed against\ntheir request.Second, a due regard for the public interest in\norderly elections supported the District Court\u2019s discretionary\ndecision to deny a preliminary injunction and to stay the\nproceedings. SeePurcellv.Gonzalez, 549 U.\u00a0S.\n1, 4\u20135 (2006) (per curiam). Plaintiffs themselves\nrepresented to the District Court that any injunctive relief would\nhave to be granted by August 18, 2017, to ensure the timely\ncompletion of a new districting scheme in advance of the 2018\nelection season. Despite the District Court\u2019s undisputedly diligent\nefforts, however, that date had \u201calready come and gone\u201d by the time\nthe court ruled on plaintiffs\u2019 motion. 266 F.\u00a0Supp.\u00a03d,\nat 815. (Such deadline has also, of course, long since passed for\npurposes of entering a preliminary injunction on remand from this\nCourt.)On top of this time constraint was the legal\nuncertainty surrounding any potential remedy for the plaintiffs\u2019\nasserted injury. At the time the District Court made its decision,\nthe appeal inGillwas pending before this Court. The\nDistrict Court recognized that our decision inGillhad the\npotential to \u201cshed light on critical questions in this case\u201d and to\nset forth a \u201cframework\u201d by which plaintiffs\u2019 claims could be\ndecided and, potentially, remedied. 266 F.\u00a0Supp.\u00a03d, at\n815\u2013816. In the District Court\u2019s view, \u201ccharging ahead\u201d and\nadjudicating the plaintiffs\u2019 claims in that fluctuating legal\nenvironment, when firmer guidance from this Court might have been\nforthcoming, would have been a mistake.Id.,at 816. Such a\ndetermination was within the sound discretion of the District\nCourt. Given the District Court\u2019s decision to wait for this Court\u2019s\nruling inGillbefore further adjudicating plaintiffs\u2019\nclaims, the court reasonably could have concluded that a\npreliminary injunction would have been against the public interest,\nas an injunction might have worked a needlessly \u201cchaotic and\ndisruptive effect upon the electoral process,\u201dFishman,supra, at 1330, and because the \u201cpurpose of a preliminary\ninjunction is merely to preserve the relative positions of the\nparties until a trial on the merits can be held,\u201dUniversity of\nTex.v.Camenisch, 451 U.\u00a0S. 390, 395 (1981). In\nthese particular circumstances, we conclude that the District\nCourt\u2019s decision denying a preliminary injunction cannot be\nregarded as an abuse of discretion.The order of the District Court isAffirmed.",
