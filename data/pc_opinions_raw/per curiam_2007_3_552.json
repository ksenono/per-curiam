ALLEN, COMMISSIONER, ALABAMA DEPARTMENT\nOF CORRECTIONSv.DANIEL SIEBERTon petition for writ of certiorari to the united\nstates court of appeals for the eleventh circuitNo. 06\u20131680.\u2003Decided November 5, 2007Per Curiam.Daniel Siebert was convicted and\nsentenced to death in the State of Alabama for the murder of Linda\nJarman. Siebert\u2019s conviction and sentence were affirmed on direct\nappeal, and the certificate of judgment issued on May 22, 1990.\nThis Court denied certiorari on November 5, 1990.Siebertv.Alabama,498 U. S. 963. On August\n25, 1992, Siebert filed a petition for postconviction relief in\nAlabama state court. The state courts denied the petition as\nuntimely, however, because it was filed approximately three months\nafter the expiration of the then-applicable 2-year statute of\nlimitations, 2 Ala. Rule Crim. Proc. 32.2(c) (2000\u20132001), which\nbegan to run from the date the certificate of judgment issued.* The\nAlabama Supreme Court denied certiorari on September 15, 2000.\nSiebert did not seek review in this Court. On September 14, 2001,\nSiebert filed a petition for a federal writ of habeas corpus, see\n28 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a72254, in the District Court for the Northern\nDistrict of Alabama.The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty\nAct of 1996 (AEDPA) established a 1-year statute of limitations for\nfiling a federal habeas petition. \u00a72244(d)(1). The limitations\nperiod is tolled, however, while \u201ca properly filed application for\nState post-conviction or other collateral review with respect to\nthe pertinent judgment or claim is pending.\u201d \u00a72244(d)(2). Because\nSiebert\u2019s direct appeal became final before AEDPA became effective,\nthe 1-year limitations period began to run from April 24, 1996,\nAEDPA\u2019s effective date. SeeCareyv.Saffold,536 U. S. 214,\n217 (2002). Thus, absent tolling, Siebert\u2019s federal habeas petition\nwould be untimely by over four years.The District Court dismissed Siebert\u2019s habeas\npetition as untimely, reasoning that an application for state\npostconviction relief is not \u201cproperly filed\u201d if it was rejected by\nthe state court on statute-of-limitations grounds. The Court of\nAppeals reversed, however, holding that Siebert\u2019s state\npostconviction petition was \u201cproperly filed\u201d within the meaning of\n\u00a72244(d)(2), because the state time bar was not jurisdictional and\nthe Alabama courts therefore had discretion in enforcing it. SeeSiebertv.Campbell, 334 F.\u00a03d 1018, 1030\n(CA11 2003)(per curiam). The Court of Appeals accordingly\nremanded to the District Court to consider the merits of Siebert\u2019s\npetition.While Siebert\u2019s habeas petition was pending on\nremand in the District Court, we decidedPacev.DiGuglielmo,544 U. S. 408(2005). InPace, we held that a state postconviction petition\nrejected by the state court as untimely is not \u201cproperly filed\u201d\nwithin the meaning of \u00a72244(d)(2).Id., at 414, 417.\nRelying onPace, the District Court again found that\nSiebert\u2019s state postconviction petition was not \u201cproperly filed,\u201d\nand dismissed his federal habeas petition as untimely. The Court of\nAppeals, however, reversed and remanded. In a one-paragraph\nopinion, the court distinguishedPaceon the ground that\nRule 32.2(c), unlike the statute of limitations at issue inPace, \u201coperate[s] as an affirmative defense.\u201d 480\nF.\u00a03d 1089, 1090 (CA11 2007). Thus, the court found its prior\nholding\u2014that Siebert\u2019s state postconviction petition was \u201cproperly\nfiled\u201d because the state court rejected it on a nonjurisdictional\nground\u2014stood as the law of the case.Ibid.The Court of Appeals\u2019 carve-out of time limits\nthat operate as affirmative defenses is inconsistent with our\nholding inPace. Although the Pennsylvania statute of\nlimitations at issue inPacehappens to have been a\njurisdictional time bar under state law, seeCommonwealthv.Banks, 556 Pa. 1, 5\u20136, 726 A.\u00a02d 374, 376 (1999),\nthe jurisdictional nature of the time limit was not the basis for\nour decision. Rather, we built upon a distinction that we had\nearlier articulated inArtuzv.Bennett,531 U. S. 4(2000),\nbetween postconviction petitions rejected on the basis of\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018filing\u2019 conditions,\u201d which are not \u201cproperly filed\u201d under\n\u00a72244(d)(2), and those rejected on the basis of \u201cprocedural bars\n[that] go to the ability to obtain relief,\u201d which are.Pace,supra, at 417 (citingArtuz,supra, at 10\u201311). We found that statutes of limitations\nare \u201cfiling\u201d conditions because they \u201cgo to the very initiation of\na petition and a court\u2019s ability to consider that petition.\u201dPace, 544 U. S., at 417. Thus, we held \u201cthat time limits,no matter their form, are \u2018filing\u2019 conditions,\u201d and that a\nstate postconviction petition is therefore not \u201cproperly filed\u201d if\nit was rejected by the state court as untimely.Ibid.(emphasis added).In short, our holding inPaceturned\nnot on the nature of the particular time limit relied upon by the\nstate court, but rather on the fact that time limits generally\nestablish \u201cconditions to filing\u201d a petition for state\npostconviction relief. Whether a time limit is jurisdictional, an\naffirmative defense, or something in between, it is a \u201ccondition to\nfiling,\u201dArtuz,supra, at 9\u2014it places a limit on\nhow long a prisoner can wait before filing a postconviction\npetition. The fact that Alabama\u2019s Rule 32.2(c) is an affirmative\ndefense that can be waived (or is subject to equitable tolling)\nrenders it no less a \u201cfiling\u201d requirement than a jurisdictional\ntime bar would be; it only makes it a less stringent one. Indeed,\ninPacewe cited the very statute at issue in this case as\nan example of such a \u201cfiling\u201d requirement. See 544 U. S., at 417,\nn.\u00a07 (citing 2 Ala. Rule Crim. Proc. 32.2(c) (2004\u20132005)).Excluding fromPace\u2019s scope those\ntime limits that operate as affirmative defenses would leave a\ngaping hole in what we plainly meant to be a general rule, as\nstatutes of limitations are often affirmative defenses. See,e.g., Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 8(c);Kirklandv.State, 143 Idaho 544, 546, 149 P.\u00a03d 819, 821 (2006)\n(\u201cThe statute of limitations for petitions for post-conviction\nrelief is not jurisdictional. It \u2018is an affirmative defense that\nmay be waived if it is not pleaded by the defendant\u2019\u00a0\u201d\n(quotingColev.State, 135 Idaho 107, 110, 15\nP.\u00a03d 820, 823 (2000); citation omitted));Peoplev.Boclair, 202 Ill.\u00a02d 89, 101, 789 N.\u00a0E. 2d 734,\n742 (2002) (holding that time bar for filing postconviction\npetition is \u201can affirmative defense and can be raised, waived, or\nforfeited, by the State\u201d). What is more, whether a time limit is\njurisdictional or an affirmative defense is often a disputed\nquestion, as the interpretive history of Rule 32.2(c) itself\nillustrates, seeEx parte Ward, No. 1051818, 2007 WL\n1576054, *6 (Ala., June 1, 2007) (noting confusion in the Alabama\nlower courts over whether Rule 32.2(c) is jurisdictional). Under\nthe Court of Appeals\u2019 approach, federal habeas courts would have to\ndelve into the intricacies of state procedural law in deciding\nwhether a postconviction petition rejected by the state courts as\nuntimely was nonetheless \u201cproperly filed\u201d under \u00a72244(d)(2). Our\ndecision inPaceprecludes such an approach.We therefore reiterate now what we held inPace: \u201cWhen a postconviction petition is untimely under\nstate law, \u2018that [is] the end of the matter\u2019 for purposes of\n\u00a72244(d)(2).\u201d 544 U. S., at 414 (quotingCarey, 536 U. S.,\nat 226; alteration in original). Because Siebert\u2019s petition for\nstate postconviction relief was rejected as untimely by the Alabama\ncourts, it was not \u201cproperly filed\u201d under \u00a72244(d)(2). Accordingly,\nhe was not entitled to tolling of AEDPA\u2019s 1-year statute of\nlimitations.The petition for certiorari is granted. The\njudgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is\nremanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.*\u00a0At the time Siebert\u2019s petition was before\nthe Alabama courts, Rule 32.2(c) provided that \u201cthe court shall not\nentertain any petition,\u201d with certain exceptions not applicable\nhere, \u201cunless the petition is filed \u2026 within two (2) years after\nthe issuance of the certificate of judgment by the Court of\nCriminal Appeals.\u201d The statute has since been amended to provide\nfor a 1-year limitations period, but is otherwise unchanged. See 1\nAla. Rule Crim. Proc. 32.2(c) (2007\u20132008).",
