    "text": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESDANIEL RIVAS-VILLEGASv.RAMON\nCORTESLUNAon petition for writ of certiorari to the\nunited states court of appeals for the ninth circuitNo. 20\u20131539.\u2003Decided October 18, 2021Per Curiam.Petitioner Daniel Rivas-Villegas, a police\nofficer in Union City, California, responded to a 911 call\nreporting that a woman and her two children were barricaded in a\nroom for fear that respondent Ramon Cortesluna, the woman\u2019s\nboyfriend, was going to hurt them. After confirming that the family\nhad no way of escaping the house, Rivas-Villegas and the other\nofficers present commanded Cortesluna outside and onto the ground.\nOfficers saw a knife in Cortesluna\u2019s left pocket. While\nRivas-Villegas and another officer were in the process of removing\nthe knife and handcuffing Cortesluna, Rivas-Villegas briefly placed\nhis knee on the left side of Cortesluna\u2019s back. Cortesluna later\nsued under Rev. Stat. \u00a71979, 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71983, alleging,\nas relevant, that Rivas-Villegas used excessive force. At issue\nhere is whether Rivas-Villegas is entitled to qualified immunity\nbecause he did not violate clearly established law.The undisputed facts are as follows. A 911\noperator received a call from a crying 12-year-old girl reporting\nthat she, her mother, and her 15-year-old sister had shut\nthemselves into a room at their home because her mother\u2019s\nboyfriend, Cortesluna, was trying to hurt them and had a chainsaw.\nThe girl told the operator that Cortesluna was \u201c\u00a0\u2018always\ndrinking,\u2019\u00a0\u201d had \u201c\u00a0\u2018anger issues,\u2019\u00a0\u201d was\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018really mad,\u2019\u00a0\u201d and was using the chainsaw to\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018break something in the house.\u2019\u00a0\u201dCorteslunav.Leon, 979 F.3d 645, 649 (CA9 2020). A police dispatcher\nrelayed this information along with a description of Cortesluna in\na request for officers to respond.Rivas-Villegas heard the broadcast and responded\nto the scene along with four other officers. The officers spent\nseveral minutes observing the home and reported seeing through a\nwindow a man matching Cortesluna\u2019s description. One officer asked\nwhether the girl and her family could exit the house. Dispatch\nresponded that they \u201c\u00a0\u2018were unable to get out\u2019\u00a0\u201d and\nconfirmed that the 911 operator had \u201c\u00a0\u2018hear[d] sawing in the\nbackground\u2019\u00a0\u201d and thought that Cortesluna might be trying to\nsaw down the door.Corteslunav.Leon, 2018 WL\n6727824, *2 (ND Cal., Dec. 21, 2018).After receiving this information, Rivas-Villegas\nknocked on the door and stated loudly, \u201c\u00a0\u2018police department,\ncome to the front door, Union City police, come to the front\ndoor.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIbid.Another officer yelled, \u201c\u00a0\u2018he\u2019s\ncoming and has a weapon.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIbid.A different officer\nthen stated, \u201c\u00a0\u2018use less-lethal,\u2019\u00a0\u201d referring to a\nbeanbag shotgun.Ibid.When Rivas-Villegas ordered\nCortesluna to \u201c\u00a0\u2018drop it,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Cortesluna dropped the\n\u201cweapon,\u201d later identified as a metal tool.Ibid.Rivas-Villegas then commanded, \u201c\u00a0\u2018come out,\nput your hands up, walk out towards me.\u2019\u00a0\u201d 979 F.\u00a03d, at\n650. Cortesluna put his hands up and Rivas-Villegas told him to\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018keep coming.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIbid.As Cortesluna walked out\nof the house and toward the officers, Rivas-Villegas said,\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018Stop. Get on your knees.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIbid.Plaintiff\nstopped 10 to 11 feet from the officers. Another officer then saw a\nknife sticking out from the front left pocket of Cortesluna\u2019s pants\nand shouted, \u201c\u00a0\u2018he has a knife in his left pocket, knife in\nhis pocket,\u2019\u00a0\u201d and directed Cortesluna, \u201c\u00a0\u2018don\u2019t put your\nhands down,\u2019\u00a0\u201d \u201c\u00a0\u2018hands up.\u2019\u00a0\u201d 2018 WL 6727824, *2.\nCortesluna turned his head toward the instructing officer but then\nlowered his head and his hands in contravention of the officer\u2019s\norders. Another officer twice shot Cortesluna with a beanbag round\nfrom his shotgun, once in the lower stomach and once in the left\nhip.After the second shot, Cortesluna raised his\nhands over his head. The officers shouted for him to \u201c\u00a0\u2018get\ndown,\u2019\u00a0\u201d which he did. Another officer stated, \u201c\u00a0\u2018left\npocket, he\u2019s got a knife.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIbid.Rivas-Villegas then\nstraddled Cortesluna. He placed his right foot on the ground next\nto Cortesluna\u2019s right side with his right leg bent at the knee. He\nplaced his left knee on the left side of Cortesluna\u2019s back, near\nwhere Cortesluna had a knife in his pocket. He raised both of\nCortesluna\u2019s arms up behind his back. Rivas-Villegas was in this\nposition for no more than eight seconds before standing up while\ncontinuing to hold Cortesluna\u2019s arms. At that point, another\nofficer, who had just removed the knife from Cortesluna\u2019s pocket\nand tossed it away, came and handcuffed Cortesluna\u2019s hands behind\nhis back. Rivas-Villegas lifted Cortesluna up and moved him away\nfrom the door.Cortesluna brought suit under 42\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71983, claiming, as relevant here, that\nRivas-Villegas used excessive force in violation of the Fourth\nAmendment. The District Court granted summary judgment to\nRivas-Villegas, but the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit\nreversed. 979 F.\u00a03d, at 656.The Court of Appeals held that \u201cRivas-Villegas\nis not entitled to qualified immunity because existing precedent\nput him on notice that his conduct constituted excessive force.\u201dId.,at 654. In reaching this conclusion, the Court of\nAppeals relied solely onLaLondev.County of\nRiverside,204 F.3d 947(CA9 2000). The court acknowledged that \u201cthe\nofficers here responded to a more volatile situation than did the\nofficers inLaLonde.\u201d 979 F.\u00a03d, at 654. Nevertheless,\nit reasoned: \u201cBothLaLondeand this case involve suspects\nwho were lying face-down on the ground and were not resisting\neither physically or verbally, on whose back the defendant officer\nleaned with a knee, causing allegedly significant injury.\u201dIbid.Judge Collins dissented. As relevant, he argued\nthat \u201cthe facts ofLaLondeare materially distinguishable\nfrom this case and are therefore insufficient to have made clear to\nevery reasonable officer that the force Rivas-Villegas used here\nwas excessive.\u201dId.,at 664 (internal quotation marks\nomitted).We agree and therefore reverse. Even assuming\nthat controlling Circuit precedent clearly establishes law for\npurposes of \u00a71983,LaLondedid not give fair notice to\nRivas-Villegas. He is thus entitled to qualified immunity.\u201cQualified immunity attaches when an official\u2019s\nconduct does not violate clearly established statutory or\nconstitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have\nknown.\u201dWhitev.Pauly, 580 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___\n(2017) (per curiam) (slip op., at 6) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). A right is clearly established when it is\n\u201csufficiently clear that every reasonable official would have\nunderstood that what he is doing violates that right.\u201dMullenixv.Luna, 577 U.S. 7, 11 (2015) (per\ncuriam) (internal quotation marks omitted). Although \u201cthis\nCourt\u2019s case law does not require a case directly on point for a\nright to be clearly established, existing precedent must have\nplaced the statutory or constitutional question beyond debate.\u201dWhite, 580 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 6) (alterations\nand internal quotation marks omitted). This inquiry \u201cmust be\nundertaken in light of the specific context of the case, not as a\nbroad general proposition.\u201dBrosseauv.Haugen,543 U.S.\n194, 198 (2004) (per curiam) (internal quotation marks\nomitted).\u201c[S]pecificity is especially important in the\nFourth Amendment context, where .\u00a0.\u00a0. it is sometimes\ndifficult for an officer to determine how the relevant legal\ndoctrine, here excessive force, will apply to the factual situation\nthe officer confronts.\u201dMullenix, 577 U.\u00a0S., at 12\n(alterations and internal quotation marks omitted). Whether an\nofficer has used excessive force depends on \u201cthe facts and\ncircumstances of each particular case, including the severity of\nthe crime at issue, whether the suspect poses an immediate threat\nto the safety of the officers or others, and whether he is actively\nresisting arrest or attempting to evade arrest by flight.\u201dGrahamv.Connor,490 U.S.\n386, 396 (1989); see alsoTennesseev.Garner,471 U.S.\n1, 11 (1985) (\u201cWhere the officer has probable cause to believe\nthat the suspect poses a threat of serious physical harm, either to\nthe officer or to others, it is not constitutionally unreasonable\nto prevent escape by using deadly force\u201d). However,Graham\u2019s\nandGarner\u2019s standards are cast \u201cat a high level of\ngenerality.\u201dBrosseau, 543 U.\u00a0S., at 199. \u201c[I]n an\nobvious case, these standards can \u2018clearly establish\u2019 the answer,\neven without a body of relevant case law.\u201dIbid.But this is\nnot an obvious case. Thus, to show a violation of clearly\nestablished law, Cortesluna must identify a case that put\nRivas-Villegas on notice that his specific conduct was\nunlawful.Cortesluna has not done so. Neither Cortesluna\nnor the Court of Appeals identified any Supreme Court case that\naddresses facts like the ones at issue here. Instead, the Court of\nAppeals relied solely on its precedent inLaLonde. Even\nassuming that Circuit precedent can clearly establish law for\npurposes of \u00a71983,LaLondeis materially distinguishable and\nthus does not govern the facts of this case.InLaLonde, officers were responding to a\nneighbor\u2019s complaint that LaLonde had been making too much noise in\nhis apartment. 204 F.\u00a03d, at 950\u2013951. When they knocked on\nLaLonde\u2019s door, he \u201cappeared in his underwear and a T-shirt,\nholding a sandwich in his hand.\u201dId.,at 951. LaLonde\ntestified that, after he refused to let the officers enter his\nhome, they did so anyway and informed him he would be arrested for\nobstruction of justice.Ibid.One officer then knocked the\nsandwich from LaLonde\u2019s hand and \u201cgrabbed LaLonde by his ponytail\nand knocked him backwards to the ground.\u201dId.,at 952. After\na short scuffle, the officer sprayed LaLonde in the face with\npepper spray. At that point, LaLonde ceased resisting and another\nofficer, while handcuffing LaLonde, \u201cdeliberately dug his knee into\nLaLonde\u2019s back with a force that caused him long-term if not\npermanent back injury.\u201dId.,at 952, 960, n.\u00a017.The situation inLaLondeand the\nsituation at issue here diverge in several respects. InLaLonde, officers were responding to a mere noise complaint,\nwhereas here they were responding to a serious alleged incident of\ndomestic violence possibly involving a chainsaw. In addition,\nLaLonde was unarmed. Cortesluna, in contrast, had a knife\nprotruding from his left pocket for which he had just previously\nappeared to reach. Further, in this case, video evidence shows, and\nCortesluna does not dispute, that Rivas-Villegas placed his knee on\nCortesluna for no more than eight seconds and only on the side of\nhis back near the knife that officers were in the process of\nretrieving. LaLonde, in contrast, testified that the officer\ndeliberately dug his knee into his back when he had no weapon and\nhad made no threat when approached by police. These facts,\nconsidered together in the context of this particular arrest,\nmaterially distinguish this case fromLaLonde.\u201cPrecedent involving similar facts can help move\na case beyond the otherwise hazy borders between excessive and\nacceptable force and thereby provide an officer notice that a\nspecific use of force is unlawful.\u201dKiselav.Hughes,\n584 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2018) (per curiam) (slip op., at 5)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). On the facts of this case,\nneitherLaLondenor any decision of this Court is\nsufficiently similar. For that reason, we grant Rivas-Villegas\u2019\npetition for certiorari and reverse the Ninth Circuit\u2019s\ndetermination that Rivas-Villegas is not entitled to qualified\nimmunity.It is so ordered.",
