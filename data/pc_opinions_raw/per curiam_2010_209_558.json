S. ____ (2010)SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESERIC PRESLEYv.GEORGIAon petition for writ of certiorari to the supreme\ncourt of georgiaNo. 09\u20135270.\u2003Decided January 19, 2010Per Curiam.After a jury trial in the\nSuperior Court of DeKalb County, Georgia, petitioner Eric Presley\nwas convicted of a cocaine trafficking offense. The conviction was\naffirmed by the Supreme Court of Georgia. 285 Ga. 270, 674\nS.\u00a0E. 2d 909 (2009). Presley seeks certiorari, claiming his\nSixth and Fourteenth Amendment right to a public trial was violated\nwhen the trial court excluded the public from thevoir\ndireof prospective jurors. The Supreme Court of Georgia\u2019s\naffirmance contravened this Court\u2019s clear precedents. Certiorari\nand petitioner\u2019s motion for leave to proceedin forma\npauperisare now granted, and the judgment is reversed.Before selecting a jury in Presley\u2019s trial,\nthe trial court noticed a lone courtroom observer.Id.,at\n270\u2013271, 674 S.\u00a0E. 2d, at 910. The court explained that\nprospective jurors were about to enter and instructed the man that\nhe was not allowed in the courtroom and had to leave that floor of\nthe courthouse entirely.Id.,at 271, 674 S.\u00a0E. 2d,\nat 910. The court then questioned the man and learned he was\nPresley\u2019s uncle.Ibid.The court reiterated its\ninstruction:\u201c\u00a0\u2018Well, you still can\u2019t sit out in the\naudience with the jurors. You know, most of the afternoon actually\nwe\u2019re going to be picking a jury. And we may have a couple of\npre-trial matters, so you\u2019re welcome to come in after we \u2026 complete\nselecting the jury this afternoon. But, otherwise, you would have\nto leave the sixth floor, because jurors will be all out in the\nhallway in a few moments. That applies to everybody who\u2019s got a\ncase.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIbid.Presley\u2019s counsel objected to \u201c\u00a0\u2018the exclusion\nof the public from the courtroom,\u2019\u00a0\u201d but the court explained,\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018[t]here just isn\u2019t space for them to sit in the\naudience.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIbid.When Presley\u2019s counsel requested\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018some accommodation,\u2019\u00a0\u201d the court explained its ruling\nfurther:\u201c\u00a0\u2018Well, the uncle can certainly come back in\nonce the trial starts. There\u2019s no, really no need for the uncle to\nbe present during jury selection\u2026\u00a0. [W]e have 42 jurors coming\nup. Each of those rows will be occupied by jurors. And his uncle\ncannot sit and intermingle with members of the jury panel. But,\nwhen the trial starts, the opening statements and other matters, he\ncan certainly come back into the courtroom.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIbid.After Presley was convicted, he\nmoved for a new trial based on the exclusion of the public from the\njurorvoir dire. At a hearing on the motion, Presley\npresented evidence showing that 14 prospective jurors could have\nfit in the jury box and the remaining 28 could have fit entirely on\none side of the courtroom, leaving adequate room for the public.\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. E\u201337, E\u201341. The trial court denied the\nmotion, commenting that it preferred to seat jurors throughout the\nentirety of the courtroom, and \u201cit\u2019s up to the individual judge to\ndecide . . . what\u2019s comfortable.\u201dId.,E\u201338. The court\ncontinued: \u201cIt\u2019s totally up to my discretion whether or not I want\nfamily members in the courtroom to intermingle with the jurors and\nsit directly behind the jurors where they might overhear some\ninadvertent comment or conversation.\u201dId.,at E\u201342 to\nE\u201343. On appeal, the Court of Appeals of Georgia agreed, finding\n\u201c[t]here was no abuse of discretion here, when the trial court\nexplained the need to exclude spectators at the voir dire stage of\nthe proceedings and when members of the public were invited to\nreturn afterward.\u201d 290 Ga. App. 99, 100\u2013101, 658 S.\u00a0E. 2d 773,\n775 (2008).The Supreme Court of Georgia granted\ncertiorari and affirmed, with two justices dissenting. After\nfinding \u201cthe trial court certainly had an overriding interest in\nensuring that potential jurors heard no inherently prejudicial\nremarks from observers during voir dire,\u201d the Supreme Court of\nGeorgia rejected Presley\u2019s argument that the trial court was\nrequired to consider alternatives to closing the courtroom. 285\nGa., at 272, 273, 674 S.\u00a0E. 2d, at 911. It noted that \u201cthe\nUnited States Supreme Court [has] not provide[d] clear guidance\nregarding whether a court must, sU. S.onte, advance its own\nalternatives to [closure],\u201d and the court ruled that \u201cPresley was\nobliged to present the court with any alternatives that he wished\nthe court to consider.\u201dId.,at 273, 674 S.\u00a0E. 2d, at\n911, 912. When no alternatives are offered, it concluded, \u201cthere is\nno abuse of discretion in the court\u2019s failure to sU. S.onte advance\nits own alternatives.\u201dId.,at 274, 674 S.\u00a0E. 2d, at\n912.This Court\u2019s rulings with respect to the\npublic trial right rest upon two different provisions of the Bill\nof Rights, both applicable to the States via the Due Process Clause\nof the Fourteenth Amendment. The Sixth Amendment directs, in\nrelevant part, that \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused\nshall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial \u2026\u00a0.\u201d The\nCourt inIn\u00a0re Oliver,333 U. S. 257, 273\n(1948), made it clear that this right extends to the States. The\nSixth Amendment right, as the quoted language makes explicit, is\nthe right of the accused.The Court has further held that the public\ntrial right extends beyond the accused and can be invoked under the\nFirst Amendment.Press-Enterprise Co.v.Superior\nCourt of Cal., Riverside Cty.,464 U. S. 501(1984)(Press-Enterprise I). This requirement, too, is binding on\nthe States.Ibid.The case now before the Court is\nbrought under the Sixth Amendment, for it is the accused who\ninvoked his right to a public trial. An initial question is whether\nthe right to a public trial in criminal cases extends to the jury\nselection phase of trial, and in particular thevoir direof prospective jurors. In the First Amendment context that question\nwas answered inPress-Enterprise I.Id., at 510.\nThe Court there held that thevoir direof prospective\njurors must be open to the public under the First Amendment. Later\nin the same Term asPress-Enterprise I, the Court\nconsidered a Sixth Amendment case concerning whether the public\ntrial right extends to a pretrial hearing on a motion to suppress\ncertain evidence.Wallerv.Georgia,467 U. S. 39(1984). TheWallerCourt relied heavily uponPress-Enterprise\nIin finding that the Sixth Amendment right to a public trial\nextends beyond the actual proof at trial. It ruled that the\npretrial suppression hearing must be open to the public because\n\u201cthere can be little doubt that the explicit Sixth Amendment right\nof the accused is no less protective of a public trial than the\nimplicit First Amendment right of the press and public.\u201d 467 U. S.,\nat 46.WhilePress-Enterprise Iwas heavily\nrelied upon inWaller, the jury selection issue in the\nformer case was resolved under the First, not the Sixth, Amendment.Press-Enterprise I,supra, at 516 (Stevens, J.,\nconcurring) (\u201cThe constitutional protection for the right of access\nthat the Court upholds today is found in the First Amendment,\nrather than the public trial provision of the Sixth\u201d (footnote\nomitted)). In the instant case, the question then arises whether it\nis so well settled that the Sixth Amendment right extends to juryvoir direthat this Court may proceed by summary\ndisposition.The point is well settled underPress-Enterprise IandWaller. The extent to\nwhich the First and Sixth Amendment public trial rights are\ncoextensive is an open question, and it is not necessary here to\nspeculate whether or in what circumstances the reach or protections\nof one might be greater than the other. Still, there is no\nlegitimate reason, at least in the context of juror selection\nproceedings, to give one who asserts a First Amendment privilege\ngreater rights to insist on public proceedings than the accused\nhas. \u201cOur cases have uniformly recognized the public-trial\nguarantee as one created for the benefit of the defendant.\u201dGannett Co.v.DePasquale,443 U. S. 368, 380\n(1979). There could be no explanation for barring the accused from\nraising a constitutional right that is unmistakably for his or her\nbenefit. That rationale suffices to resolve the instant matter. The\nSupreme Court of Georgia was correct in assuming that the Sixth\nAmendment right to a public trial extends to thevoir direof prospective jurors.While the accused does have a right to insist\nthat thevoir direof the jurors be public, there are\nexceptions to this general rule. \u201c[T]he right to an open trial may\ngive way in certain cases to other rights or interests, such as the\ndefendant\u2019s right to a fair trial or the government\u2019s interest in\ninhibiting disclosure of sensitive information.\u201dWaller,467 U. S.,at 45. \u201cSuch circumstances will be rare,\nhowever, and the balance of interests must be struck with special\ncare.\u201dIbid. Wallerprovided standards for courts to apply\nbefore excluding the public from any stage of a criminal trial:\u201c[T]he party seeking to close the hearing must\nadvance an overriding interest that is likely to be prejudiced, the\nclosure must be no broader than necessary to protect that interest,\nthe trial court must consider reasonable alternatives to closing\nthe proceeding, and it must make findings adequate to support the\nclosure.\u201dId.,at 48.In upholding exclusion of the\npublic at jurorvoir direin the instant case, the Supreme\nCourt of Georgia concluded, despite our explicit statements to the\ncontrary, that trial courts need not consider alternatives to\nclosure absent an opposing party\u2019s proffer of some alternatives.\nWhile the Supreme Court of Georgia concluded this was an open\nquestion under this Court\u2019s precedents, the statement inWallerthat \u201cthe trial court must consider reasonable\nalternatives to closing the proceeding\u201d settles the point.Ibid.If that statement leaves any room for doubt, the\nCourt was more explicit inPress-Enterprise I:\u201cEven with findings adequate to support closure,\nthe trial court\u2019s orders denying access tovoir diretestimony failed to consider whether alternatives were available to\nprotect the interests of the prospective jurors that the trial\ncourt\u2019s orders sought to guard. Absent consideration of\nalternatives to closure, the trial court could not constitutionally\nclose thevoir dire.\u201d 464 U. S.,at 511.The conclusion that trial courts\nare required to consider alternatives to closure even when they are\nnot offered by the parties is clear not only from this Court\u2019s\nprecedents but also from the premise that \u201c[t]he process of juror\nselection is itself a matter of importance, not simply to the\nadversaries but to the criminal justice system.\u201dId.,at\n505. The public has a right to be present whether or not any party\nhas asserted the right. InPress-Enterprise I, for\ninstance, neither the defendant nor the prosecution requested an\nopen courtroom during jurorvoir direproceedings; in\nfact, both specifically argued in favor of keeping the transcript\nof the proceedings confidential.Id.,at 503\u2013504. The\nCourt, nonetheless, found it was error to close the courtroom.Id.,at 513.Trial courts are obligated to take every\nreasonable measure to accommodate public attendance at criminal\ntrials. Nothing in the record shows that the trial court could not\nhave accommodated the public at Presley\u2019s trial. Without knowing\nthe precise circumstances, some possibilities include reserving one\nor more rows for the public; dividing the jury venire panel to\nreduce courtroom congestion; or instructing prospective jurors not\nto engage or interact with audience members.Petitioner also argues that, apart from\nfailing to consider alternatives to closure, the trial court erred\nbecause it did not even identify any overriding interest likely to\nbe prejudiced absent the closure ofvoir dire. There is\nsome merit to this complaint. The generic risk of jurors\noverhearing prejudicial remarks, unsubstantiated by any specific\nthreat or incident, is inherent whenever members of the public are\npresent during the selection of jurors. If broad concerns of this\nsort were sufficient to override a defendant\u2019s constitutional right\nto a public trial, a court could exclude the public from jury\nselection almost as a matter of course. As noted in the dissent\nbelow, \u201cthe majority\u2019s reasoning permits the closure of voir dire\ninevery criminal caseconducted in this courtroom\nwhenever the trial judge decides, for whatever reason, that he or\nshe would prefer to fill the courtroom with potential jurors rather\nthan spectators.\u201d 285 Ga., at 276, 674 S.\u00a0E. 2d, at 913\n(opinion of Sears, C.\u00a0J.).There are no doubt circumstances where a judge\ncould conclude that threats of improper communications with jurors\nor safety concerns are concrete enough to warrant closingvoir\ndire. But in those cases, the particular interest, and threat\nto that interest, must \u201cbe articulated along with findings specific\nenough that a reviewing court can determine whether the closure\norder was properly entered.\u201dPress-Enterprise I, supra,at\n510; see alsoPress-Enterprise Co.v.Superior Court\nof Cal., County of Riverside,478 U. S. 1, 15 (1986)\n(\u201cThe First Amendment right of access cannot be overcome by the\nconclusory assertion that publicity might deprive the defendant of\n[the right to a fair trial]\u201d).We need not rule on this second claim of\nerror, because even assuming,arguendo, that the trial\ncourt had an overriding interest in closingvoir dire, it\nwas still incumbent upon it to consider all reasonable alternatives\nto closure. It did not, and that is all this Court needs to\ndecide.The Supreme Court of Georgia\u2019s judgment is\nreversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not\ninconsistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.",
