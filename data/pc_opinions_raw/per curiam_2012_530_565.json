MARCHIO, executrix of the\nESTATE OF PAULINE VIRGINIA WILLETTon petitions for writs of certiorari to the\nsupreme court of appeals of west virginiaNos. 11\u2013391 and 11\u2013394.\u2003Decided February 21,\n2012Per Curiam.State and federal courts must enforce the\nFederal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71et\u00a0seq., with respect to all arbitration agreements\ncovered by that statute. Here, the Supreme Court of Appeals of West\nVirginia, by misreading and disregarding the precedents of this\nCourt interpreting the FAA, did not follow controlling federal law\nimplementing that basic principle. The state court held unenforce-\nable all predispute arbitration agreements that apply to claims\nalleging personal injury or wrongful death against nursing\nhomes.The decision of the state court found the FAA\u2019s\ncoverage to be more limited than mandated by this Court\u2019s previous\ncases. The decision of the State Supreme Court of Appeals must be\nvacated. When this Court has fulfilled its duty to interpret\nfederal law, a state court may not contradict or fail to implement\nthe rule so established. See U.\u00a0S. Const., Art.\u00a0VI, cl.\n2.IThis litigation involves three negligence\nsuits against nursing homes in West Virginia. The suits were\nbrought by Clayton Brown, Jeffrey Taylor, and Sharon Marchio. In\neach case, a family member of a patient requiring extensive nursing\ncare had signed an agreement with a nursing home on behalf of the\npatient. The relevant parts of the agreements in Brown\u2019s case and\nTaylor\u2019s case were identical. The contracts included a clause\nrequiring the parties to arbitrate all disputes, other than claims\nto col- lect late payments owed by the patient. The contracts\nincluded a provision holding the party filing the arbitration\nresponsible for paying a filing fee in accordance with the Rules of\nthe American Arbitration Association fee schedules. The agreement\nin Marchio\u2019s case also included a clause requiring arbitration but\nmade no exceptions to the arbitration requirement and did not\nmention filing fees.In each of the three cases, a family member of a\npatient who had died sued the nursing home in state court, alleging\nthat negligence caused injuries or harm resulting in death. A state\ntrial court dismissed the suits by Brown and Taylor based on the\nagreements to arbitrate. The Supreme Court of Appeals of West\nVirginia consolidated those cases with Marchio\u2019s, which was before\nthe court on other issues.In a decision concerning all three cases, the\nstate court held that \u201cas a matter of public policy under West\nVirginia law, an arbitration clause in a nursing home admission\nagreement adopted prior to an occurrence of negligence that results\nin a personal injury or wrongful death, shall not be enforced to\ncompel arbitration of a dispute concerning the negligence.\u201dBrownv.Genesis Healthcare Corp., No. 35494\n(W.\u00a0Va., June 29, 2011), App. to Pet. for Cert. in\nNo.\u00a011\u2013391, pp. 85a\u201386a (hereinafter Pet. App.). The state\ncourt considered whether the state public policy was pre-empted by\nthe FAA. The state court found unpersuasive this Court\u2019s\ninterpretation of the FAA, calling it \u201ctendentious,\u201did., at\n51a, and \u201ccreated from whole cloth,\u201did., at 53a. It later\nconcluded that \u201cCongress did not intend for the FAA to be, in any\nway, applicable to personal injury or wrongful death suits that\nonly collaterally derive from a written agreement that evidences a\ntransaction affecting interstate commerce, particularly where the\nagreement involves a service that is a practical necessity for\nmembers of the public,\u201did., at 84a. The court thus\nconcluded that the FAA does not pre-empt the state pub- lic policy\nagainst predispute arbitration agreements that apply to claims of\npersonal injury or wrongful death against nursing homes.The West Virginia court\u2019s interpretation of the\nFAA was both incorrect and inconsistent with clear instruction in\nthe precedents of this Court. The FAA provides that a \u201cwritten\nprovision in .\u00a0.\u00a0. a contract evidencing a transaction\ninvolving commerce to settle by arbitration a controversy\nthereafter arising out of such contract or transaction\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save\nupon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation\nof any contract.\u201d 9 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72. The statute\u2019s text\nincludes no exception for personal-injury or wrongful-death claims.\nIt \u201crequires courts to enforce the bargain of the parties to\narbitrate.\u201dDean Witter Reynolds Inc.v.Byrd,470 U.S.\n213, 217 (1985). It \u201creflects an emphatic federal policy in\nfavor of arbitral dispute resolution.\u201dKPMG LLPv.Cocchi, 565 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2011)(per curiam)(slip op., at 3) (quotingMitsubishi Motors Corp.v.Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc.,473 U.S.\n614, 631 (1985); internal quotation marks omitted).As this Court reaffirmed last Term, \u201c[w]hen\nstate law prohibits outright the arbitration of a particular type\nof claim, the analysis is straightforward: The conflicting rule is\ndisplaced by the FAA.\u201dAT&T Mobility LLCv.Concepcion, 563 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at\n6\u20137). That rule resolves these cases. West Virginia\u2019s prohibition\nagainst predispute agreements to arbitrate personal-injury or\nwrongful-death claims against nursing homes is a cate- gorical rule\nprohibiting arbitration of a particular type of claim, and that\nrule is contrary to the terms and coverage of the FAA. Seeibid.See also,e.g., Prestonv.Ferrer,552 U.S.\n346, 356 (2008) (FAA pre-empts state law granting state\ncommissioner exclusive jurisdiction to decide issue the parties\nagreed to arbitrate);Mastrobuonov.Shearson Lehman\nHutton, Inc.,514 U.S.\n52, 56 (1995) (FAA pre-empts state law requiring judicial\nresolution of claims involving punitive damages);Perryv.Thomas,482 U.S.\n483, 491 (1987) (FAA pre-empts state-law requirement that\nlitigants be provided a judicial forum for wage disputes);Southland Corp.v.Keating,465 U.S.\n1, 10 (1984) (FAA pre-empts state financial investment\nstatute\u2019s prohibition of arbitration of claims brought under that\nstatute).IIThe West Virginia court proposed an\n\u201calternativ[e]\u201d hold- ing that the particular arbitration clauses\nin Brown\u2019s case and Taylor\u2019s case were unconscionable. Pet. App.\n89a\u201391a, 94a. See alsoid., at 98a (not addressing the\nquestion whether the arbitration agreement in Marchio\u2019s case is\nunenforceable for reasons other than public policy). It is unclear,\nhowever, to what degree the state court\u2019s alternative holding was\ninfluenced by the invalid, categorical rule discussed above, the\nrule against predispute arbitration agreements. For example, in its\ndiscussion of the alternative holding, the state court found the\narbitration clauses unconscionable in part because a predispute\narbitration agreement that applies to claims of personal injury or\nwrongful death against nursing homes \u201cclearly violates public\npolicy.\u201dId.,at 91a.On remand, the West Virginia court must consider\nwhether, absent that general public policy, the arbitration clauses\nin Brown\u2019s case and Taylor\u2019s case are unenforce- able under state\ncommon law principles that are not specific to arbitration and\npre-empted by the FAA.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*The petition for certiorari is granted. The\njudgment of the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia is\nvacated, and the cases are remanded for proceedings not\ninconsistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.",
