    "text": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES_________________No. 21A471_________________WISCONSIN LEGISLATURE, et al.v.WISCONSIN ELECTIONS COMMISSION, et al.on application for stay and injunctive\nrelief[March 23, 2022]Per Curiam.Because of population shifts revealed by the\n2020 decennial census, Wisconsin\u2019s State Assembly and Senate\ndistricts are no longer equally apportioned. The Wisconsin\nLegislature passed new maps to fix the problem, but the Governor\nvetoed them. At an impasse, the legislature and the Governor turned\nto the Wisconsin Supreme Court, which had already agreed to hear an\noriginal action brought by a group of voters seeking to remedy the\nmalapportionment. Rather than attempt to draw new maps itself, the\ncourt invited the parties and intervenors\u2014including the legislature\nand the Governor\u2014to propose maps that complied with the State\nConstitution, the Federal Constitution, and the Voting Rights Act\nof 1965 (VRA), 79Stat. 437, as amended, 52 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a710301et seq., and that otherwise minimized changes from\nthe current maps.On March 3, the court issued a decision\nselecting the Assembly and Senate maps that the Governor had\nproposed.Johnsonv.Wisconsin Elections Comm\u2019n, 2022\nWI 14, ___ Wis.\u00a02d ___, ___ N.\u00a0W.\u00a02d ___. (Because\nthe State Constitution requires three Assembly districts to be\nnested within each Senate district, the court analyzed and selected\nthe maps as a unit.Id., \u00b626.) The Governor\u2019s Assembly map\nintentionally created seven majority-black districts\u2014one more than\nthe current map.[1] The\nGovernor argued that the addition of a seventh majority-black\ndistrict was necessary for compliance with the VRA. In adopting the\nGovernor\u2019s map, the court explained: \u201c[W]e cannot say for certain\non this record that seven majority-Black assembly districts are\nrequired by the VRA.\u201dId., \u00b647. It nevertheless concluded\nthat the Governor\u2019s map complied with the Equal Protection Clause\nof the Fourteenth Amendment because there were \u201cgood reasons\u201d to\nthink that the VRA \u201cmay\u201d require the additional majority-black\ndistrict.Id., \u00b650.The legislature and the voters who initiated the\nstate-court proceeding now seek relief from that decision. They\nargue that the court selected race-based maps without sufficient\njustification, in violation of the Equal Protection Clause. They\nask this Court either to grant an emergency stay or to construe\ntheir application as a petition for certiorari and reverse the\ndecision below.We agree that the court committed legal error in\nits application of decisions of this Court regarding the\nrelationship between the constitutional guarantee of equal\nprotection and the VRA. We accordingly construe the application for\nstay presented to Justice Barrett and by her referred to the Court\nas a petition for certiorari, grant the petition, reverse the\nimposition of the Governor\u2019s State Assembly and Senate maps, and\nremand to the Wisconsin Supreme Court for proceedings not\ninconsistent with this opinion. Summarily correcting the error\ngives the court sufficient time to adopt maps consistent with the\ntimetable for Wisconsin\u2019s August 9th primary election.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*Under the Equal Protection Clause, districting\nmaps that sort voters on the basis of race \u201c\u00a0\u2018are by their\nvery nature odious.\u2019\u00a0\u201dShawv.Reno,509 U.S.\n630, 643 (1993). Such laws \u201ccannot be upheld unless they are\nnarrowly tailored to achieving a compelling state interest.\u201dMillerv.Johnson,515 U.S.\n900, 904 (1995). We have assumed that complying with the VRA is\na compelling interest.Cooperv.Harris, 581\nU.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 2). And we have held that\nif race is the predominant factor motivating the placement of\nvoters in or out of a particular district, the State bears the\nburden of showing that the design of that district withstands\nstrict scrutiny.Ibid.Thus, our precedents hold that a\nState can satisfy strict scrutiny if it proves that its race-based\nsorting of voters is narrowly tailored to comply with the VRA.Ibid.A State violates \u00a72 of the VRA \u201cif, based on the\ntotality of circumstances, it is shown that the political processes\nleading to nomination or election in the State or political\nsubdivision are not equally open to participation by members of [a\nminority group] in that its members have less opportunity than\nother members of the electorate to participate in the political\nprocess and to elect representatives of their choice.\u201d 52\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a710301(b). We have construed \u00a72 to prohibit the\ndistribution of minority voters into districts in a way that\ndilutes their voting power. SeeThornburgv.Gingles,478 U.S.\n30, 46\u201351 (1986). InGingles, we provided a framework\nfor demonstrating a violation of that sort. First, three\n\u201cpreconditions\u201d must be shown: (1)\u00a0The minority group must be\nsufficiently large and compact to constitute a majority in a\nreasonably configured district, (2)\u00a0the minority group must be\npolitically cohesive, and (3)\u00a0a majority group must vote\nsufficiently as a bloc to enable it to usually defeat the minority\ngroup\u2019s preferred candidate.Id., at 50\u201351.If the preconditions are established, a court\nconsiders the totality of circumstances to determine \u201cwhether the\npolitical process is equally open to minority voters.\u201dId.,\nat 79; see alsoJohnsonv.De Grandy,512 U.S.\n997, 1011\u20131012 (1994) (satisfying theGinglespreconditions is necessary but not sufficient to show a \u00a72\nviolation; \u201ccourts must also examine other evidence in the totality\nof circumstances\u201d). We have identified as relevant to the totality\nanalysis several factors enumerated in the Senate Report on the\n1982 amendments to the VRA, as well as \u201cwhether the number of\ndistricts in which the minority group forms an effective majority\nis roughly proportional to its share of the population in the\nrelevant area.\u201dLeague of United Latin American Citizensv.Perry,548 U.S.\n399, 426 (2006) (LULAC).We said inCooperthat when a State\ninvokes \u00a72 to justify race-based districting, \u201cit must show (to\nmeet the \u2018narrow tailoring\u2019 requirement) that it had \u2018a strong\nbasis in evidence\u2019 for concluding that the statute required its\naction.\u201d 581 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 3). The Wisconsin\nSupreme Court concluded that the Governor\u2019s intentional addition of\na seventh majority-black district triggered the Equal Protection\nClause and thatCooper\u2019s strict-scrutiny test must\naccordingly be satisfied. Accepting those conclusions, we hold that\nthe court erred in its efforts to applyCooper\u2019s\nunderstanding of what the Equal Protection Clause requires.It is not clear whether the court viewed the\nGovernor or itself as the state mapmaker who must satisfy strict\nscrutiny, but the court\u2019s application ofCooperwas flawed\neither way. If the former, the Governor failed to carry his burden.\nHis main explanation for drawing the seventh majority-black\ndistrict was that there is now a sufficiently large and compact\npopulation of black residents to fill it, Brief for\nIntervenor-Respondent Evers inJohnsonv.Wisconsin\nElections Comm\u2019n, No. 2021AP1450\u2013OA (Wis. Sup.\u00a0Ct., Dec.\n15, 2021), p.\u00a014\u2014apparently embracing just the sort of\nuncritical majority-minority district maximization that we have\nexpressly rejected.De Grandy, 512 U.\u00a0S., at 1017\n(\u201cFailure to maximize cannot be the measure of \u00a72\u201d). He provided\nalmost no other evidence or analysis supporting his claim that the\nVRA required the seven majority-black districts that he drew. See\n2022 WI 14, \u00b6\u00b690\u201391, 103\u2013107 (Ziegler, C.\u00a0J., dissenting).\nStrict scrutiny requires much more. SeeAbbottv.Perez, 585 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2018) (slip op., at 40)\n(\u201c[W]here we have accepted a State\u2019s \u2018good reasons\u2019 for using race\nin drawing district lines, the State made a strong showing of a\npre-enactment analysis with justifiable conclusions\u201d). If the\nWisconsin Supreme Court was reviewing whether the Governor\nsatisfied strict scrutiny, it erred by adopting his maps.If, on the other hand, the court sought to\nshoulder strict scrutiny\u2019s burden itself, it fared little better.First, it misunderstoodCooper\u2019s inquiry. The court\nbelieved that it had to conclude only that the VRAmightsupport race-based districting\u2014not that the statute required it.\nSee 2022 WI 14, \u00b6\u00b647, 50 (\u201c[W]e cannot say for certain on this\nrecord that seven majority-Black assembly districts are required by\nthe VRA,\u201d but \u201cwe see good reasons to conclude a seventh\nmajority-Black assembly districtmaybe required\u201d (emphasis\nadded)). Our precedent instructs otherwise. Thus inCooperwe explained, for example, that \u201crace-based districting is narrowly\ntailored .\u00a0.\u00a0. if a State had \u2018good reasons\u2019 for thinking\nthat the Actdemandedsuch steps.\u201d 581 U.\u00a0S., at ___\n(slip op., at 12) (emphasis added). And we concluded that\n\u201cexperience gave the State no reason to think that the VRArequired\u201d it to move voters based on race.Id., at\n___ (slip op., at 14) (emphasis added). That principle grew out of\nthe more general proposition that \u201cthe institution that makes the\nracial distinction must have had a \u2018strong basis in evidence\u2019 to\nconclude that remedial action wasnecessary, \u2018beforeit embarks on an affirmative-action program.\u2019\u00a0\u201dShawv.Hunt,517 U.S.\n899, 910 (1996) (some emphasis added).To be sure, we said inCooperthat States\nhave \u201c\u00a0\u2018breathing room\u2019\u00a0\u201d to make reasonable mistakes; we\nwill not fault a State just because its \u201ccompliance measures\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. may prove, in perfect hindsight, not to have been\nneeded.\u201d 581 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 3). But that \u201cleeway\u201d\ndoes not allow a State to adopt a racial gerrymander that the State\ndoes not, at the time of imposition, \u201cjudg[e] necessary under a\nproper interpretation of the VRA.\u201dId., at ___ (slip op., at\n17).Second, the court\u2019s analysis ofGingles\u2019 preconditions fell short of our standards. As we\nexplained inCooper, \u201c[t]o have a strong basis in evidence\nto conclude that \u00a72 demands .\u00a0.\u00a0. race-based steps, the\nState must carefully evaluate whether a plaintiff could establish\ntheGinglespreconditions .\u00a0.\u00a0. in a new district\ncreated without those measures.\u201d 581 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 15). Rather than carefully evaluating evidence at the district\nlevel, the court improperly relied on generalizations to reach the\nconclusion that the preconditions were satisfied. Seeid.,\nat ___, n.\u00a05 (slip op., at 16, n.\u00a05) (a \u201cgeneralized\nconclusion fails to meaningfully .\u00a0.\u00a0. address the\nrelevant local question\u201d whether the preconditions would be\nsatisfied as to each district).The court\u2019s entire discussion of the first\nprecondition was to say that \u201cit is undisputed\u201d and \u201cthe parties\u2019\nsubmissions demonstrate\u201d that seven sufficiently large and compact\nmajority-black districts could be drawn. 2022 WI 14, \u00b643.\nSimilarly, its discussion of the second precondition consisted of\nnothing but the statement that \u201c[e]xperts from multiple parties\nanalyzed voting trends and concluded political cohesion existed; no\nparty disagreed.\u201dId., \u00b644. And while the court did cite one\nspecific expert report for the third precondition\u2014calculating,\nbased on eight previous races, how often white voters in the\nMilwaukee area defeat the preferred candidate of black voters\u2014it\nmade virtually no effort to parse that data at the district level\nor respond to criticisms of the expert\u2019s analysis.Id., \u00b645;\nseeid., \u00b6\u00b6108\u2013111 (Ziegler, C.\u00a0J.,\ndissenting).[2]Third, the court improperly reducedGingles\u2019 totality-of-circumstances analysis to a single\nfactor. The court acknowledged the Senate factors but concluded\nthat they had no role to play in its analysis. 2022 WI 14, \u00b646, and\nn.\u00a028. Instead, it focused exclusively on proportionality. Seeid., \u00b6\u00b646\u201350. We rejected just that approach inDe\nGrandy, explaining that \u201c[n]o single statistic provides courts\nwith a shortcut to determine whether a set of single-member\ndistricts unlawfully dilutes minority voting strength.\u201d 512\nU.\u00a0S., at 1020\u20131021; see alsoid., at 1026 (O\u2019Connor,\nJ., concurring) (\u201cThe Court .\u00a0.\u00a0. makes clear that\nproportionality is never dispositive. Lack of proportionality can\nnever by itself prove dilution, for courts must always carefully\nand searchingly review the totality of the circumstances\u201d).The question that our VRA precedents ask and the\ncourt failed to answer is whether a race-neutral alternative that\ndid not add a seventh majority-black district would deny black\nvoters equal political opportunity. Answering that question\nrequires an \u201c\u00a0\u2018\u00a0\u201cintensely local appraisal\u201d\u00a0\u2019 of the\nchallenged district.\u201dLULAC, 548 U.\u00a0S., at 437. When\nthe Wisconsin Supreme Court endeavored to undertake a full\nstrict-scrutiny analysis, it did not do so properly under our\nprecedents, and its judgment cannot stand.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*The judgment of the Supreme Court of Wisconsin\nis reversed as to the selection of the Governor\u2019s State Assembly\nand Senate maps, and the case is remanded for further proceedings\nnot inconsistent with this opinion. On remand, the court is free to\ntake additional evidence if it prefers to reconsider the Governor\u2019s\nmaps rather than choose from among the other submissions. Any new\nanalysis, however, must comply with our equal protection\njurisprudence.It is so ordered.Notes1The Governor\u2019s map\naccomplished this addition by reducing the black voting-age\npopulation in the other six majority-black districts. The black\nvoting-age populations in the Governor\u2019s seven districts all\ncluster between 50.1% and 51.4%, compared to the current six\ndistricts\u2019 range of 51% to 62%. See 2022 WI 14, \u00b687 (Ziegler,\nC.\u00a0J., dissenting).2That sole piece of cited\nrecord evidence came from an intervenor who argued that the\nGovernor\u2019s mapviolatedthe VRA. See 2022 WI 14, \u00b6\u00b691, 112\n(Ziegler, C.\u00a0J., dissenting); Response Brief for\nIntervenor-Petitioner Black Leaders Organizing for Communities\net\u00a0al. inJohnsonv.Wisconsin Elections Comm\u2019n,\nNo. 2021AP1450\u2013OA (Wis. Sup.\u00a0Ct., Dec. 30, 2021),\npp.\u00a07\u201320. The court did not acknowledge or respond to that\nargument.",
