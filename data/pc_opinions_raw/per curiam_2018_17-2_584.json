Satisfied that the agents had\ndemonstrated probable cause to believe that the account was being\nused to further illegal drug trafficking, a Magistrate Judge issued\nthe requested \u00a72703 warrant. App. 22\u201326. The warrant directed\nMicrosoft to disclose to the Government the contents of a specified\ne-mail account and all other records or information associated with\nthe account \u201c[t]o the extent that the information .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nis within [Microsoft\u2019s] possession, custody, or control.\u201dId., at 24.After service of the \u00a72703 warrant, Microsoft\ndetermined that the account\u2019s e-mail contents were stored in a sole\nlocation: Microsoft\u2019s datacenter in Dublin, Ireland.Id.,at\n34. Microsoft moved to quash the warrant with respect to the\ninformation stored in Ireland. The Magistrate Judge denied\nMicrosoft\u2019s motion.In re Warrant To Search a Certain E-Mail\nAccount Controlled and Maintained by Microsoft Corp., 15\nF.\u00a0Supp.\u00a03d 466 (SDNY 2014). The District Court, after a\nhearing, adopted the Magistrate Judge\u2019s reasoning and affirmed his\nruling. SeeIn\u00a0re Warrant To Search a Certain E-Mail\nAccount Controlled and Maintained by Microsoft Corp., 829\nF.\u00a03d 197, 204\u2013205 (CA2 2016). Soon after, acting on a\nstipulation submitted jointly by the parties, the District Court\nheld Microsoft in civil contempt for refusing to comply fully with\nthe warrant.Id.,at 205. On appeal, a panel of the Court of\nAppeals for the Second Circuit reversed the denial of the motion to\nquash and vacated the civil contempt finding, holding that\nrequiring Microsoft to disclose the electronic communications in\nquestion would be an unauthorized extraterritorial application of\n\u00a72703.Id.,at 222.The parties now advise us that on March 23,\n2018, Congress enacted and the President signed into law the\nClarifying Lawful Overseas Use of Data Act (CLOUD Act), as part of\nthe Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018, Pub. L. 115\u2013141. The\nCLOUD Act amends the Stored Communications Act, 18\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72701et\u00a0seq., by adding the\nfollowing provision:\u201cA [service provider] shall comply with\nthe obligations of this chapter to preserve, backup, or disclose\nthe contents of a wire or electronic communication and any record\nor other information pertaining to a customer or subscriber within\nsuch provider\u2019s possession, custody, or control, regardless of\nwhether such communication, record, or other information is located\nwithin or outside of the United States.\u201d CLOUD Act \u00a7103(a)(1).Soon thereafter, the Government obtained,\npursuant to the new law, a new \u00a72703 warrant covering the\ninformation requested in the \u00a72703 warrant at issue in this\ncase.No live dispute remains between the parties over\nthe issue with respect to which certiorari was granted. SeeDepartment of Treasury, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and\nFirearmsv.Galioto, 477 U.\u00a0S. 556, 559 (1986) .\nFurther, the parties agree that the new warrant has replaced the\noriginal warrant. This case, therefore, has become moot. Following\nthe Court\u2019s established practice in such cases, the judgment on\nreview is accordingly vacated, and the case is remanded to the\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit with\ninstructions first to vacate the District Court\u2019s contempt finding\nand its denial of Microsoft\u2019s motion to quash, then to direct the\nDistrict Court to dismiss the case as moot.It is so ordered.",
