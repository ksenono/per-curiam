    "text": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESSCOTT KERNAN, SECRETARY, CALIFORNIA\nDE-PARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABIL-ITATIONv.ANTONIO A.\nHINOJOSAon petition for writ of certiorari to the\nunited states court of appeals for the ninth circuitNo. 15\u2013833\u2003Decided May 16, 2016Per Curiam.The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty\nAct of 1996 (AEDPA) requires a state prisoner seeking federal\nhabeas relief first to \u201cexhaus[t] the remedies available in the\ncourts of the State.\u201d 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72254(b)(1)(A). If the\nstate courts adjudicate the prisoner\u2019s federal claim \u201con the\nmerits,\u201d \u00a72254(d), then AEDPA mandates deferential, rather thande\u00a0novo, review, prohibiting federal courts from\ngranting habeas relief unless the state-court decision \u201cwas\ncontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly\nestablished Federal law,\u201d \u00a72254(d)(1), or \u201cwas based on an\nunreasonable determination of the facts,\u201d \u00a72254(d)(2). The Ninth\nCircuit in this case decided that the Supreme Court of California\u2019s\nsummary denial of a habeas petition wasnot\u201con the merits,\u201d\nand therefore AEDPA\u2019s deferential-review provisions did not apply.\nWe summarily reverse.Respondent Antonio Hinojosa was serving a\n16-year sentence for armed robbery and related crimes when,in 2009,\nCalifornia prison officials \u201cvalidated\u201d him as a prison-gang\nassociate and placed him in a secured housing unit. At the time of\nHinojosa\u2019s offense and conviction, California law had permitted\nprisoners placed in a secured housing unit solely by virtue of\ntheir prison-gang affiliations to continue to accrue good-time\ncredits. See Cal. Penal Code Ann. \u00a72933.6 (West 2000). In 2010, the\nCalifornia Legislature amended the law so that prison-gang\nassociates placed in a secured housing unit could no longer earn\nfuture good-time credits, although they would retain any credits\nalready earned. \u00a72933.6(a) (West Supp. 2016).Hinojosa filed a state habeas petition, arguing\n(as relevant here) that applying the new law to him violated the\nFederal Constitution\u2019s prohibition ofex post factolaws.\nSee Art.\u00a0I, \u00a710, cl.\u00a01;Weaverv.Graham,\n450 U.\u00a0S. 24 (1981) . The Orange County Superior Court denied\nthe claim \u201con grounds petitioner has not sought review of his claim\nof error in the proper judicial venue.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 44a.\nThe court explained:\u201c\u00a0\u2018Although any superior court has\njurisdiction to entertain and adjudicate a petition for writ of\nhabeas corpus, it does not follow that it should do so in all\ninstances.\u2019 Challenges to conditions of an inmate\u2019s confinement\nshould be entertained by the superior court of county wherein the\ninmate is confined. (Griggs v. Superior Court(1976) 16\nCal.\u00a03d 341, 347.)\u201cThe petition for writ of habeas corpus is\nDENIED.\u201dId., at 44a\u201345a.[1]Rather than file a new petition in the correct\nvenue (Kings County Superior Court), Hinojosa turned to the\nappellate court, which summarily denied his petition. Instead of\nappealing that denial, see Cal. Penal Code Ann. \u00a71506 (West Supp.\n2016), Hinojosa sought an original writ of habeas corpus in the\nSupreme Court of California, see Cal. Const., Art. 6, \u00a710, which\nsummarily denied relief without explanation.A petition for federal habeas relief followed.\nAdopting the Magistrate Judge\u2019s findings and recommendation, the\nDistrict Court denied Hinojosa\u2019sex post factoclaim under\nAEDPA\u2019s deferential review. A Ninth Circuit panel reversed.Hinojosav.Davey, 803 F.\u00a03d 412 (2015). Citing\nour decision inYlstv.Nunnemaker, 501 U.\u00a0S.\n797 (1991) , the panel \u201clooked through\u201d the Supreme Court of\nCalifornia\u2019s summary denial to the last reasoned decision\nadjudicating Hinojosa\u2019s claim: the Superior Court\u2019s dismissal for\nimproper venue. The panel reasoned that the Superior Court\u2019s\ndecision \u201cis not a determination \u2018on the merits\u2019\u00a0\u201d and that as\na result it was \u201cnot bound by AEDPA.\u201d 803 F.\u00a03d, at 419.\nHaving thus freed itself from AEDPA\u2019s strictures, the court granted\nHinojosa\u2019s petition for habeas relief.We reverse. InYlst, we said that where\n\u201cthe last reasoned opinion on the claim explicitly imposes a\nprocedural default, we will presume that a later decision rejecting\nthe claim did not silently disregard that bar and consider the\nmerits.\u201d 501 U.\u00a0S., at 803. We adopted this presumption\nbecause \u201csilence implies consent, not the opposite\u2014and courts\ngenerally behave accordingly, affirming without further discussion\nwhen they agree, not when they disagree, with the reasons given\nbelow.\u201dId.,at 804. But we pointedly refused to make the\npresumption irrebuttable; \u201cstrong evidence can refute it.\u201dIbid.It is amply refuted here. Improper venue could\nnot possibly have been a ground for the high court\u2019s summary denial\nof Hinojosa\u2019s claim. There is only one Supreme Court of\nCalifornia\u2014and thus only one venue in which Hinojosa could have\nsought an original writ of habeas corpus in that court. Under these\ncircumstances, it cannot be that the State Supreme Court\u2019s denial\n\u201crest[ed] upon the same ground\u201d as the Superior Court\u2019s.Id.,at 803. It quite obviously rested upon some different\nground.Ylst\u2019s \u201clook-through\u201d approach is therefore\ninapplicable.[2]Hinojosa resists this conclusion, remarking that\n\u201ca reviewing court has discretion to denywithout prejudicea habeas corpus petition that was not filed first in a proper lower\ncourt.\u201dIn\u00a0re Steele, 32 Cal. 4th 682, 692, 85\nP.\u00a03d 444, 449 (2004) (emphasis added). But there is no\nindication that the summary denial here was without prejudice, thus\nrefuting Hinojosa\u2019s speculation.Containing no statement to the contrary, the\nSupreme Court of California\u2019s summary denial of Hinojosa\u2019s petition\nwas therefore on the merits.Harringtonv.Richter,\n562 U.\u00a0S. 86, 99 (2011) . Accordingly, the Ninth Circuit\nshould have reviewed Hinojosa\u2019sex post factoclaim through\nAEDPA\u2019s deferential lens. And although we express no view on the\nmerits of that claim, we note that the Ninth Circuit has already\nheld that state-court denials of claims identical to Hinojosa\u2019s are\nnot contrary to clearly established federal law. SeeNevarezv.Barnes, 749 F.\u00a03d 1124 (CA9 2014); see alsoIn\u00a0re Efstathiou, 200 Cal. App. 4th 725, 730\u2013732, 133\nCal. Rptr. 3d 34, 37\u201340 (2011);In\u00a0re Sampson, 197 Cal.\nApp. 4th 1234, 1240\u20131244, 130 Cal. Rptr. 3d 39, 43\u201346 (2011). The\npanel below recognized as much: \u201cIf AEDPA applies here, we are\nbound by our decision inNevarezand must affirm the\ndistrict court\u2019s denial of Hinojosa\u2019s petition.\u201d 803 F.\u00a03d, at\n418. AEDPA applies here.The petition for a writ of certiorari and\nHinojosa\u2019s motion for leave to proceedin forma pauperisare\ngranted, and the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth\nCircuit is reversed.It is so ordered.Notes1InGriggsv.Superior Ct. of San Bernardino Cty., 16 Cal.\u00a03d 341,\n347, 546 P.\u00a02d 727, 731 (1976), the Supreme Court of\nCalifornia stated that \u201c[a]s a general rule,\u201d if a prisoner files a\nhabeas petition challenging the conditions of his confinement in a\ncounty other than the one in which he is confined, the court should\nnot deny the petition unless it fails to state a prima facie case.\nIn this case, however, there is no hint in the opinion of the\nSuperior Court that it followed this approach, and petitioner does\nnot claim that it did.2Alternatively, if the\nSuperior Court in fact followedGriggs\u2019 instructions and\nsilently concluded that the claim did not state a prima facie case\nfor relief, see n.\u00a01,supra, the decision of the\nSupreme Court of California would still be a decision on the\nmerits, and the AEDPA standard of review would still\napply.",
