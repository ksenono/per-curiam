S. ____ (2009)SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESROBERT WONG, WARDENv.FERNANDO BELMONTES,\nJr.on petition for writ of certiorari to the united\nstates court of appeals for the ninth circuitNo. 08\u20131263.\u2003Decided November 16, 2009Per Curiam.In 1981, in the course of a\nburglary, Fernando Belmontes bludgeoned Steacy McConnell to death,\nstriking her in the head 15 to 20 times with a steel dumbbell bar.\nSeePeoplev.Belmontes,45 Cal. 3d\n744, 759\u2013761,755 P.2d 310,\n315\u2013316 (1988). After the murder, Belmontes and his accomplices\nstole McConnell\u2019s stereo, sold it for $100, and used the money to\nbuy beer and drugs for the night.Id., at 764\u2013765, 755\nP.\u00a02d, at 318\u2013319.Belmontes was convicted of murder and\nsentenced to death in state court. Unsuccessful on direct appeal\nand state collateral review, Belmontes sought federal habeas\nrelief, which the District Court denied. The Court of Appeals\nreversed, finding instructional error, but we overturned that\ndecision.Ayersv.Belmontes,549 U. S. 7(2006); see\nalsoBrownv.Belmontes,544 U. S. 945(2005).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On remand, the Court of Appeals again ruled for\nBelmontes, this time finding that Belmontes suffered ineffective\nassistance of counsel during the sentencing phase of his trial. The\nDistrict Court had previously denied relief on that ground, finding\nthat counsel for Belmontes had performed deficiently under Ninth\nCircuit precedent, but that Belmontes could not establish prejudice\nunderStricklandv.Washington,466 U. S. 668(1984).Belmontesv.Calderon, Civ. S\u201389\u20130736 DFL JFM (ED\nCal., Aug. 15, 2000), App. to Pet. for Cert. 140a, 179a, 183a. The\nCourt of Appeals agreed that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient,\nbut disagreed with the District Court with respect to prejudice,\ndetermining that counsel\u2019s errors undermined confidence in the\npenalty phase verdict.Belmontesv.Ayers, 529\nF.\u00a03d 834, 859\u2013863, 874 (CA9 2008). We disagree with the Court\nof Appeals as to prejudice, grant the State\u2019s petition for\ncertiorari, and reverse.IBelmontes argues that his counsel\nwas constitutionally ineffective for failing to investigate and\npresent sufficient mitigating evidence during the penalty phase of\nhis trial. To prevail on this claim, Belmontes must meet both the\ndeficient performance and prejudice prongs ofStrickland,\n466 U. S., at 687. To show deficient performance, Belmontes must\nestablish that \u201ccounsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective\nstandard of reasonableness.\u201dId., at 688. In light of \u201cthe\nvariety of circumstances faced by defense counsel [and] the range\nof legitimate decisions regarding how best to represent a criminal\ndefendant,\u201d the performance inquiry necessarily turns on \u201cwhether\ncounsel\u2019s assistance was reasonable considering all the\ncircumstances.\u201dId., at 688\u2013689. At all points,\n\u201c[j]udicial scrutiny of counsel\u2019s performance must be highly\ndeferential.\u201dId., at 689.The challenge confronting\nBelmontes\u2019 lawyer, John Schick, was very specific. Substantial\nevidence indicated that Belmontes had committed a prior murder, and\nthe prosecution was eager to introduce that evidence during the\npenalty phase of the McConnell trial. The evidence of the prior\nmurder was extensive, including eyewitness testimony, Belmontes\u2019\nown admissions, and Belmontes\u2019 possession of the murder weapon and\nthe same type of ammunition used to kill the victim. Record\n2239\u20132250, 2261; Deposition of John Schick, Exhs. 62, 63, 64 (Sept.\n26, 1995).The evidence, furthermore, was potentially\ndevastating. It would have shown that two years before Steacy\nMcConnell\u2019s death, police found Jerry Howard\u2019s body in a secluded\narea. Howard had been killed execution style, with a bullet to the\nback of the head. The authorities suspected Belmontes, but on the\neve of trial the State\u2019s witnesses refused to cooperate (Belmontes\u2019\nmother had begged one not to testify). The prosecution therefore\nbelieved it could not prove Belmontes guilty of murder beyond a\nreasonable doubt. What the prosecution could prove, even without\nthe recalcitrant witnesses, was that Belmontes possessed the gun\nused to murder Howard. So the State offered, and Belmontes\naccepted, a no-contest plea to accessory after the fact to\nvoluntary manslaughter. Record 2239\u20132243; Deposition of John\nSchick, Exhs. 62, 63, 64.But Belmontes had not been shy\nabout discussing the murder, boasting to several people that he had\nkilled Howard. Steven Cartwright informed the district attorney\nthat Belmontes had confessed to the murder. A police informant told\ndetectives that Belmontes \u201cbragged\u201d about the murder, stating that\nhe was \u201cmad\u201d at Howard because \u201cthe night before, he had quite a\n[lot] of dope and wouldn\u2019t share it with him.\u201d After double\njeopardy protection set in and he had been released on parole,\nBelmontes admitted his responsibility for the murder to his\ncounselor at the California Youth Authority, Charles Sapien. During\nhis time in confinement, Belmontes had \u201calways denied that he was\nthe [one] who shot Jerry Howard.\u201d But because Sapien \u201chad been\nsquare with [Belmontes],\u201d Belmontes decided to level with Sapien\nupon his release, telling Sapien that he had \u201c\u00a0\u2018wasted\u2019 that\nguy.\u201d Record 2240; Deposition of John Schick, Exhs. 62, 63,\n64.Schick understood the gravity of\nthis aggravating evidence, and he built his mitigation strategy\naround the overriding need to exclude it. California evidentiary\nrules, Schick knew, offered him an argument to exclude the\nevidence, but those same rules made clear that the evidence would\ncome in for rebuttal if Schick opened the door. Record 2256; see\nalsoPeoplev.Rodriguez,42 Cal. 3d\n730, 791\u2013792,726 P.2d 113,\n153 (1986);Peoplev.Harris,28 Cal. 3d\n935, 960\u2013962, 623 P.\u00a02d 240, 254 (1981). Schick thus had\n\u201cgrave concerns\u201d that, even if he succeeded initially in excluding\nthe prior murder evidence, it would still be admitted if his\nmitigation case swept too broadly. Accordingly, Schick decided to\nproceed cautiously, structuring his mitigation arguments and\nwitnesses to limit that possibility. Deposition of John Schick 301,\n309\u2013310; seeStrickland,supra, at 699\n(\u201cRestricting testimony on respondent\u2019s character to what had come\nin at the plea colloquy ensured that contrary character and\npsychological evidence and respondent\u2019s criminal history, which\ncounsel had successfully moved to exclude, would not come\nin\u201d).As Schick expected, the\nprosecution was ready to admit this evidence during the sentencing\nphase. Schick moved to exclude the evidence, arguing that the State\nshould be allowed to tell the jury only that Belmontes had been\nconvicted of being an accessory after the fact to voluntary\nmanslaughter\u2014nothing more. Record 2240\u20132254. Schick succeeded in\nkeeping the prosecution from presenting the damaging evidence in\nits sentencing case in chief, but his client remained at risk: The\ntrial court indicated the evidence would come in for rebuttal or\nimpeachmentifSchick opened the door.Id., at\n2256.This was not an empty threat. In\none instance, Schick elicited testimony that Belmontes was not a\nviolent person. The State objected and, out of earshot of the jury,\nargued that it should be able to rebut the testimony with the\nHoward murder evidence.Id., at 2332\u20132334. The Court\nwarned Schick that it was \u201cgoing to have to allow [the prosecution]\nto go into the whole background\u201d if Schick continued his line of\nquestioning.Id., at 2334. Schick acquiesced, and the\ncourt struck the testimony.Ibid.The Court\u2019s warning reinforced\nSchick\u2019s understanding that he would have to tailor his mitigation\ncase carefully to preserve his success in excluding the Howard\nmurder evidence. With that cautionary note in mind, Schick put on\nnine witnesses he thought could advance a case for mitigation,\nwithout opening the door to the prior murder evidence. Seeid., at 2312\u20132417.The Court of Appeals determined\nthat in spite of these efforts, Schick\u2019s performance was\nconstitutionally deficient under Circuit precedent.Belmontes, 529 F.\u00a03d, at 862\u2013863. The State\nchallenges that conclusion, but we need not resolve the point,\nbecause we agree with the District Court that Belmontes cannot\nestablish prejudice.IITo establish\nprejudice, Belmontes must show \u201ca reasonable probability that, but\nfor counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding\nwould have been different.\u201dStrickland, 466 U. S., at 694.\nThat showing requires Belmontes to establish \u201ca reasonable\nprobability that a competent attorney, aware of [the available\nmitigating evidence], would have introduced it at sentencing,\u201d and\n\u201cthat had the jury been confronted with this \u2026 mitigating evidence,\nthere is a reasonable probability that it would have returned with\na different sentence.\u201dWigginsv.Smith,539 U. S. 510, 535, 536\n(2003).The Ninth Circuit\ndetermined that a reasonably competent lawyer would have introduced\nmore mitigation evidence, on top of what Schick had already\npresented. For purposes of our prejudice analysis, we accept that\nconclusion and proceed to consider whether there is a reasonable\nprobability that a jury presented with this additional mitigation\nevidence would have returned a different verdict.In evaluating that question, it is\nnecessary to considerallthe relevant evidence that the\njury would have had before it if Schick had pursued the different\npath\u2014not just the mitigation evidence Schick could have presented,\nbut also the Howard murder evidence that almost certainly would\nhave come in with it. SeeStrickland,supra, at\n695\u2013696, 700. Thus, to establish prejudice, Belmontes must show a\nreasonable probability that the jury would have rejected a capital\nsentence after it weighed the entire body of mitigating evidence\n(including the additional testimony Schick could have presented)\nagainst the entire body of aggravating evidence (including the\nHoward murder evidence). Belmontes cannot meet this\nburden.We begin with the mitigating\nevidence Schick did present during the sentencing phase. That\nevidence was substantial. The same Ninth Circuit panel addressing\nthe same record in Belmontes\u2019 first habeas appeal agreed,\nrecognizing \u201cthe substantial nature of the mitigating evidence\u201d\nSchick presented.Belmontesv.Woodford, 350\nF.\u00a03d 861, 907 (2003). It reiterated the point several times.\nSeeid., at 874, 901, 908.All told, Schick put nine\nwitnesses on the stand over a span of two days, and elicited a\nrange of testimony on Belmontes\u2019 behalf. A number of those\nwitnesses highlighted Belmontes\u2019 \u201cterrible\u201d childhood. They\ntestified that his father was an alcoholic and extremely abusive.\nBelmontes\u2019 grandfather described the one-bedroom house where\nBelmontes spent much of his childhood as a \u201cchicken coop.\u201d\nBelmontes did not do well in school; he dropped out in the ninth\ngrade. His younger sister died when she was only 10 months old. And\nhis grandmother died tragically when she drowned in her swimming\npool. See Record 2314\u20132319, 2324\u20132325, 2344.Family members also testified\nthat, despite these difficulties, Belmontes maintained strong\nrelationships with his grandfather, grandmother, mother, and\nsister.Id., at 2317\u20132318, 2325\u20132326. And Belmontes\u2019 best\nfriend offered the insights of a close friend and confidant.Id., at 2329\u20132332.Schick also called witnesses who\ndetailed Belmontes\u2019 religious conversion while in state custody on\nthe accessory charge. These witnesses told stories about Belmontes\u2019\nefforts advising other inmates in his detention center\u2019s religious\nprogram, to illustrate that he could live a productive and\nmeaningful life in prison. They described his success working as\npart of a firefighting crew, detailing his rise from lowest man on\nthe team to second in command. Belmontes\u2019 assistant chaplain even\nsaid that he would use Belmontes as a regular part of his prison\ncounseling program if the jury handed down a life sentence.Id., at 2379\u20132384, 2396\u20132398, 2400\u20132407.Belmontes himself bolstered these\naccounts by testifying about his childhood and religious\nconversion, both at sentencing and during allocution. Belmontes\ndescribed his childhood as \u201cpretty hard,\u201d but took responsibility\nfor his actions, telling the jury that he did not want to use his\nbackground \u201cas a crutch[,] to say I am in a situation now \u2026 because\nof that.\u201dId., at 2343.On remand from this Court, the\nCourt of Appeals\u2014addressing Belmontes\u2019 ineffective assistance claim\nfor the first time\u2014changed its view of this evidence. Instead of\nfinding Schick\u2019s mitigation case \u201csubstantial,\u201d as it previously\nhad,Belmontes, 350 F.\u00a03d, at 907, the Ninth Circuit\nthis time around labeled it \u201ccursory,\u201dBelmontes, 529\nF.\u00a03d, at 841, 861, n.\u00a014, 866. Compare alsoBelmontes, 350 F.\u00a03d, at 874, 901, 907 (labeling the\nmitigation evidence Schick presented \u201csubstantial\u201d), withBelmontes, 529 F.\u00a03d, at 847, n. 3, 874 (labeling the\nsame evidence \u201cinsubstantial\u201d). More evidence, the Court of Appeals\nnow concluded, would have made a difference; in particular, more\nevidence to \u201chumanize\u201d Belmontes, as that court put it no fewer\nthan 11 times in its opinion.Belmontes, 529 F.\u00a03d,\nat 850, 859, 860, 862, 863, 864, 865, and n.\u00a018, 869, 872,\n874. The Court determined that the failure to put on this evidence\nprejudiced Belmontes.There are two problems with this\nconclusion: Some of the evidence was merely cumulative of the\nhumanizing evidence Schick actually presented; adding it to what\nwas already there would have made little difference. Other evidence\nproposed by the Ninth Circuit would have put into play aspects of\nBelmontes\u2019 character that would have triggered admission of the\npowerful Howard evidence in rebuttal. This evidence would have made\na difference, but in the wrong direction for Belmontes. In either\nevent, Belmontes cannot establishStricklandprejudice.First, the cumulative evidence. In\nthe Court of Appeals\u2019 view, Belmontes should have presented more\nhumanizing evidence about Belmontes\u2019 \u201cdifficult childhood\u201d and\nhighlighted his \u201cpositive attributes.\u201d 529 F.\u00a03d, at 864. As\nfor his difficult childhood, Schick should have called witnesses to\ntestify that \u201cwhen Belmontes was five years old, his 10-month-old\nsister died of a brain tumor,\u201d that he \u201cexhibited symptoms of\ndepression\u201d after her death, that his grandmother suffered from\n\u201calcoholism and prescription drug addiction,\u201d and that both his\nimmediate and extended family lived in a state of \u201cconstant\nstrife.\u201dIbid. As for his positive attributes, Schick\nshould have produced testimony about Belmontes\u2019 \u201cstrong character\nas a child in the face of adversity.\u201dIbid.Schick should\nhave illustrated that Belmontes was \u201ckind, responsible, and\nlikeable\u201d; that he \u201cgot along well with his siblings\u201d and was\n\u201crespectful towards his grandparents despite their disapproval of\nhis mixed racial background\u201d; and that he \u201cparticipated in\ncommunity activities, kept up in school and got along with his\nteachers before [an] illness, and made friends easily.\u201dIbid.But as recounted above and\nrecognized by the state courts and, originally, this very panel,\nSchickdidput on substantial mitigation evidence, much of\nit targeting the same \u201chumanizing\u201d theme the Ninth Circuit\nhighlighted. Compare,e.g.,ibid., with Record\n2317 (death of 10-month-old sister);id., at 2319, 2325\n(difficult childhood);id., at 2314\u20132315 (family member\u2019s\naddictions);id., at 2314\u20132315, 2324\u20132325 (family strife\nand abuse);id., at 2317, 2319, 2347\u20132348, 2397 (strong\ncharacter as a child);id., at 2326\u20132327 (close\nrelationship with siblings);id., at 2317\u20132319 (close\nrelationship with grandparents);id., at 2348\u20132351\n(participation in community religious events); see also,e.g., Belmontes\u2019 Traverse to Respondent\u2019s Return to Pet.\nfor Writ of Habeas Corpus in No. 5\u201389\u20130736\u2013EJG\u2013JFM (ED Cal.),\np.\u00a064 (\u201c[C]ounsel\u2019s presentation was arguably adequate only\nwith respect to [evidence] of \u2018humanizing\u2019 petitioner\u201d). The\nsentencing jury was thus \u201cwell acquainted\u201d with Belmontes\u2019\nbackground and potential humanizing features.Schrirov.Landrigan,550 U. S. 465, 481\n(2007). Additional evidence on these points would have offered an\ninsignificant benefit, if any at all.The Ninth Circuit also determined\nthat both the evidence Schick presented and the additional evidence\nit proposed would have carried greater weight if Schick had\nsubmitted expert testimony. Such testimony could \u201cmake connections\nbetween the various themes in the mitigation case and explain to\nthe jury how they could have contributed to Belmontes\u2019s involvement\nin criminal activity.\u201dBelmontes, 529 F.\u00a03d, at 853.\nSee alsoibid. (discussing expert\u2019s federal habeas\ntestimony on importance of expert testimony). But the body of\nmitigating evidence the Ninth Circuit would have required Schick to\npresent was neither complex nor technical. It required only that\nthe jury make logical connections of the kind a layperson is well\nequipped to make. The jury simply did not need expert testimony to\nunderstand the \u201chumanizing\u201d evidence; it could use its common sense\nor own sense of mercy.What is more, expert testimony\ndiscussing Belmontes\u2019 mental state, seeking to explain his\nbehavior, or putting it in some favorable context would have\nexposed Belmontes to the Howard evidence. SeeDardenv.Wainwright,477 U. S. 168, 186\n(1986) (\u201cAny attempt to portray petitioner as a nonviolent man\nwould have opened the door for the State to rebut with evidence of\npetitioner\u2019s prior convictions\u2026\u00a0. Similarly, if defense\ncounsel had attempted to put on evidence that petitioner was a\nfamily man, they would have been faced with his admission at trial\nthat, although still married, he was spending the weekend furlough\nwith a girlfriend\u201d).If, for example, an expert had\ntestified that Belmontes had a \u201c\u00a0\u2018high likelihood of a \u2026\nnonviolent adjustment to a prison setting,\u2019\u00a0\u201d as Belmontes\nsuggested an expert might, see Brief for Appellant in No. 01\u201399018\n(CA9), p.\u00a034, the question would have immediately arisen:\n\u201cWhat was his propensity toward violence to begin with? Does\nevidence of another murder alter your view?\u201d Expert testimony\nexplainingwhythe jury should feel sympathy, as opposed\nsimply to facts that might elicit that response, would have led to\na similar rejoinder: \u201cIs such sympathy equally appropriate for\nsomeone who committed a second murder?\u201d Any of this testimony from\nan expert\u2019s perspective would have made the Howard evidence fair\ngame.Many of Belmontes\u2019 other arguments\nfail for the same reason. He argues that the jury should have been\ntold that he suffered an \u201cextended bout with rheumatic fever,\u201d\nwhich led to \u201cemotional instability, impulsivity, and impairment of\nthe neurophysiological mechanisms for planning and reasoning.\u201d\nAmended Pet. for Writ of Habeas Corpus 120. But the cold,\ncalculated nature of the Howard murder and Belmontes\u2019 subsequent\nbragging about it would have served as a powerful\ncounterpoint.The type of\n\u201cmore-evidence-is-better\u201d approach advocated by Belmontes and the\nCourt of Appeals might seem appealing\u2014after all, what is there to\nlose? But here there was a lot to lose. A heavyhanded case to\nportray Belmontes in a positive light, with or without experts,\nwould have invited the strongest possible evidence in rebuttal\u2014the\nevidence that Belmontes was responsible for not one but two\nmurders.Belmontes counters that some of\nthe potential mitigating evidence might not have opened the door to\nthe prior murder evidence. The Court of Appeals went so far as to\nstate, without citation, that \u201c[t]here would be no basis for\nsuggesting that [expert testimony] would be any different if the\nexpert were informed that Belmontes committed two murders rather\nthan one.\u201dBelmontes, 529 F.\u00a03d, at 869, n.\u00a020.\nBut it is surely pertinent in assessing expert testimony\n\u201cexplain[ing] \u2026 involvement in criminal activity,\u201did., at\n853, to know what criminal activity was at issue. And even if the\nnumber of murders were as irrelevant as the Ninth Circuit asserted,\nthe fact thatthesetwo murders were so different in\ncharacter made each of them highly pertinent in evaluating expert\ntestimony of the sort envisioned by the Court of\nAppeals.The Ninth Circuit noted that the\ntrial court retained discretion to exclude the Howard evidence even\nif Schick opened the door.Id., at 869\u2013870, n.\u00a020. If\nSchick had doubts, the Court of Appeals contended, he could have\nsecured an answer in advance through a motionin limine.Ibid. The trial judge, however, left little doubt where he\nstood. While ruling that the prosecution could not present the\nevidence in its case in chief, Record 2254, the judge made clear\nthat it would come in for certain rebuttal purposes,id.,\nat 2256, 2332\u20132334. When Schick elicited testimony that Belmontes\nwas not violent, for example, the judge ordered it stricken and\nwarned Schick that he would admit the Howard murder evidence\u2014to let\nthe prosecution \u201cgo into the whole background\u201d\u2014if Schick pressed\nforward.Id., at 2334.In balancing the mitigating\nfactors against the aggravators, the Court of Appeals repeatedly\nreferred to the aggravating evidence the State presented as\n\u201cscant.\u201dBelmontes, 529 F.\u00a03d, at 870, 873, 874, 875,\n878. That characterization missesStrickland\u2019s point that\nthe reviewing court must consider all the evidence\u2014the good and the\nbad\u2014when evaluating prejudice. SeeStrickland, 466 U. S.,\nat 695\u2013696, 700. Here, the worst kind of bad evidence would have\ncome in with the good. The only reason it did not was because\nSchick was careful in his mitigation case. The State\u2019s aggravation\nevidence could only be characterized as \u201cscant\u201d if one ignores the\n\u201celephant in the courtroom\u201d\u2014Belmontes\u2019 role in the Howard\nmurder\u2014that would have been presented had Schick submitted the\nadditional mitigation evidence.Belmontesv.Ayers, 551 F.\u00a03d 864, 867 (CA9 2008) (Callahan, J.,\ndissenting from denial of rehearing en banc).Even on the record before it\u2014which\ndid not include the Howard murder\u2014the state court determined that\nBelmontes \u201cwas convicted on extremely strong evidence that he\ncommitted an intentional murder of extraordinary brutality.\u201dBelmontes, 45 Cal. 3d, at 819, 755 P. 2d, at 354. That\ncourt also noted that \u201c[t]he properly admitted aggravating evidence\nin this case\u2014in particular, the circumstances of the crime\u2014was\nsimply overwhelming.\u201dId., at 809, 755 P.\u00a02d, at 348\n(citation omitted). The Ninth Circuit saw the murder differently.\nIt viewed the circumstances of the crime as only \u201cconceivably\nsignificant\u201d as an aggravating factor.Belmontes, 529\nF.\u00a03d, at 871. In particular, the Court of Appeals concluded\nthat \u201c[t]he crime here did not involve \u2026 needless suffering on the\npart of the victim.\u201dIbid.We agree with the state court\u2019s\ncharacterization of the murder, and simply cannot comprehend the\nassertion by the Court of Appeals that this case did not involve\n\u201cneedless suffering.\u201d The jury saw autopsy photographs showing\nSteacy McConnell\u2019s mangled head, her skull crushed by 15 to 20\nblows from a steel dumbbell bar the jury found to have been wielded\nby Belmontes. McConnell\u2019s corpse showed numerous \u201cdefensive bruises\nand contusions on [her] hands, arms, and feet,\u201did., at\n839, which \u201cplainly evidenced a desperate struggle for life at\n[Belmontes\u2019] hands,\u201dBelmontes, 755 P. 2d, at 354.\nBelmontes left McConnell to die, but officers found her still\nfighting for her life before ultimately succumbing to the injuries\ncaused by the blows from Belmontes. Record 3. The jury also heard\nthat this savage murder was committed solely to prevent\ninterference with a burglary that netted Belmontes $100 he used to\nbuy beer and drugs for the night. McConnell suffered, and it was\nclearly needless.Some of the error below may be\ntraced to confusion about the appropriate standard and burden of\nproof. While the Court of Appeals quoted the pertinent language\nfromStrickland, that court elsewhere suggested it might\nhave applied something different. In explaining its prejudice\ndetermination, the Ninth Circuit concluded that \u201c[t]he aggravating\nevidence, even with the addition of evidence that Belmontes\nmurdered Howard, is not strong enough, in light of the mitigating\nevidence that could have been adduced, to rule out a sentence of\nlife in prison.\u201dBelmontes, 529 F.\u00a03d, at 875. ButStricklanddoes not require the State to \u201crule out\u201d a\nsentence of life in prison to prevail. Rather,Stricklandplaces the burden on the defendant, not the State, to show a\n\u201creasonable probability\u201d that the result would have been different.\n466 U. S., at 694. Under a proper application of theStricklandstandard, Belmontes cannot carry this\nburden.It is hard to imagine expert\ntestimony andadditionalfacts about Belmontes\u2019 difficult\nchildhood outweighing the facts of McConnell\u2019s murder. It becomes\neven harder to envision such a result when the evidence that\nBelmontes had committed another murder\u2014\u201cthe most powerful\nimaginable aggravating evidence,\u201d as Judge Levi put it,Belmontes, S-89\u20130736, App. to Pet. for Cert. 183a\u2014is added\nto the mix. Schick\u2019s mitigation strategy failed, but the notion\nthat the result could have been different if only Schick had put on\nmore than the nine witnesses he did, or called expert witnesses to\nbolster his case, is fanciful.The petition for certiorari and\nthe motion for leave to proceedin forma pauperisare\ngranted. The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit\nis reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.",
