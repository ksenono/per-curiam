In reaching this de- cision, the Court of\nAppeals relied repeatedly and extensively on our decision inMoorev.Texas, 581 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2017), which was\nnot handed down until long after the state-court decisions.The Court of Appeals\u2019 reliance onMoorewas plainly improper under \u00a72254(d)(1), and we therefore vacate\nthat decision and remand so that Hill\u2019s claim regarding\nintellectual disability can be evaluated based solely on holdings\nof this Court that were clearly established at the relevant\ntime.IIn September 1985, 12-year old Raymond Fife\nset out on his bicycle for a friend\u2019s home. When he did not arrive,\nhis parents launched a search, and that evening his father found\nRaymond\u2014naked, beaten, and burned\u2014in a wooded field. Although\nalive, he had sustained horrific injuries that we will not\ndescribe. He died two days later.In 1986, respondent Danny Hill was convicted for\ntorturing, raping, and murdering Raymond, and he was sentenced to\ndeath. An intermediate appellate court affirmed his conviction and\nsentence, as did the Ohio Supreme Court. We denied certiorari.Hillv.Ohio, 507 U.\u00a0S. 1007 (1993).After unsuccessful efforts to obtain\npostconviction relief in state and federal court, Hill filed a new\npetition in the Ohio courts contending that his death sentence is\nillegal underAtkinsv.Virginia, 536 U.\u00a0S. 304\n(2002), which held that the Eighth Amendment prohibits the\nimposition of a death sentence on a defendant who is \u201cmentally\nretarded.\u201d In 2006, the Ohio trial court denied this claim, App. to\nPet. for Cert. 381a\u2013493a, and in 2008, the Ohio Court of Appeals\naffirmed,Statev.Hill, 177 Ohio App. 3d 171,\n2008-Ohio-3509, 894 N.\u00a0E. 2d 108. In 2009, the Ohio Supreme\nCourt denied review.Statev.Hill, 122 Ohio St. 3d\n1502, 2009-Ohio-4233, 912 N.\u00a0E. 2d 107.In 2010, Hill filed a new federal habeas\npetition under 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72254, seeking review of the\ndenial of hisAtkinsclaim. The District Court denied the\npetition, App. to Pet. for Cert. 77a\u2013210a, but the Sixth Circuit\nreversed and granted habeas relief under \u00a72254(d)(1), which applies\nwhen a state-court adjudication \u201cresulted in a decision that was\ncontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly\nestablished Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the\nUnited States.\u201d SeeHillv.Anderson, 881 F.\u00a03d\n483 (2018). The Sixth Circuit found two alleged deficiencies in the\nOhio courts\u2019 decisions: First, they \u201coveremphasized Hill\u2019s adaptive\nstrengths\u201d; and second, they \u201crelied too heavily on adaptive\nstrengths that Hill exhibited in the controlled environment of his\ndeath-row prison cell.\u201dId., at 492. In reaching these\nconclusions, the court relied repeatedly on our decision inMoorev.Texas, 581 U.\u00a0S. ___. See 881\nF.\u00a03d, at 486, 487, 488, n.\u00a04, 489, 491, 492, 493, 495,\n496, 498, 500. The court acknowledged that \u201c[o]rdinarily, Supreme\nCourt decisions that post-date a state court\u2019s determination cannot\nbe \u2018clearly established law\u2019 for the purposes of [the federal\nhabeas statute],\u201d but the court argued \u201cthatMoore\u2019s holding\nregarding adaptive strengths [was] merely an application of what\nwas clearly established byAtkins.\u201dId.,at 487.The State filed a petition for a writ of\ncertiorari, contending that the Sixth Circuit violated \u00a72254(d)(1)\nbecause a fundamental underpinning of its decision wasMoore, a case decided by this Court well after the Ohio\ncourts\u2019 decisions. Against this, Hill echoes the Court of Appeals\u2019\nargument thatMooremerely spelled out what was clearly\nestablished byAtkinsregarding the assessment of adaptive\nskills.IIThe federal habeas statute, as amended by the\nAntiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA),\nimposes important limitations on the power of federal courts to\noverturn the judgments of state courts in criminal cases. The\nstatute respects the authority and ability of state courts and\ntheir dedication to the protection of constitutional rights. Thus,\nunder the statutory provision at issue here, 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a72254(d)(1), habeas relief may be granted only if the state court\u2019s\nadjudication \u201cresulted in a decision that was contrary to, or\ninvolved an unreasonable application of,\u201d Supreme Court precedent\nthat was \u201cclearly established\u201d at the time of the adjudication.E.g., Whitev.Woodall, 572 U.\u00a0S. 415, 419\u2013420\n(2014);Metrishv.Lancaster, 569 U.\u00a0S. 351,\n357\u2013358 (2013). This means that a state court\u2019s ruling must be \u201cso\nlacking in justification that there was an error well understood\nand comprehended in existing law beyond any possibility for\nfairminded dis- agreement.\u201dHarringtonv.Richter,\n562 U.\u00a0S. 86, 103 (2011). We therefore consider what was\nclearly established regarding the execution of the intellectually\ndis- abled in 2008, when the Ohio Court of Appeals rejected Hill\u2019sAtkinsclaim.Of course,Atkinsitself was on the\nbooks, butAtkinsgave no comprehensive definition of\n\u201cmental retardation\u201d for Eighth Amendment purposes.[1] The opinion of the Court noted that the\ndefinitions of mental retardation adopted by the American\nAssociation on Mental Retardation and the American Psychiatric\nAssociation required both \u201csubaverage intellectual functioning\u201d and\n\u201csignificant limitations in adaptive skills such as communication,\nself-care, and self-direction that became manifest before age 18.\u201d\n536 U.\u00a0S., at 318; see alsoid.,at 308, n. 3 (quoting\ndefinitions). The Court also noted that state statutory definitions\nof mental retardation at the time \u201c[were] not identical, but\ngenerally conform[ed] to the[se] clinical definitions.\u201dId.,at 317, n. 22. The Court then left \u201c\u00a0\u2018to the State[s] the task\nof developing appropriate ways to enforce the constitutional\nrestriction\u2019\u00a0\u201d that the Court adopted.Id., at 317\n(quotingFordv.Wainwright, 477 U.\u00a0S. 399, 416\n(1986) (plurality opinion)).More than a decade later, we expounded on the\ndefinition of intellectual disability in two cases. InHallv.Florida, 572 U.\u00a0S. 701 (2014), we considered a rule\nrestrictingAtkinsto defendants with \u201can IQ test score of\n70 or less.\u201d 572 U.\u00a0S., at 704. We held that this rule\nviolated the Eighth Amendment because it treated an IQ score higher\nthan 70 as conclusively disqualifying and thus prevented\nconsideration of other evidence of intellectual disability, such as\nevidence of \u201cdeficits in adaptive functioning over [the\ndefendant\u2019s] lifetime.\u201dId.,at 724.Three years later inMoore, we appliedHalland faulted the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals (CCA)\nfor concluding that the petitioner\u2019s IQ scores, some of which were\nat or below 70, established that he was not intellectually dis-\nabled.Moore, 581 U.\u00a0S., at ___\u2013___. We also held that\nthe CCA improperly evaluated the petitioner\u2019s adaptive functioning.\nIt erred, we concluded, in \u201coveremphasiz[ing] [petitioner\u2019s]\nperceived adaptive strengths,\u201d despite the medical community\u2019s\nfocus on \u201cadaptivedeficits.\u201dId.,at ___ (slip op.,\nat 12). And we found that the CCA also went astray in \u201cstress[ing]\n[petitioner\u2019s] improved behavior in prison,\u201d even though the\nmedical community \u201ccaution[ed] against reliance on adaptive\nstrengths developed in a controlled setting, as a prison surely\nis.\u201dId.,at ___ (slip op., at 13) (internal quotation marks\nomitted).IIIIn this case, no reader of the decision of the\nCourt of Appeals can escape the conclusion that it is heavily based\nonMoore, which came years after the decisions of the Ohio\ncourts. Indeed, the Court of Appeals, in finding an unreasonable\napplication of clearly established law, drew almost word for word\nfrom the two statements inMoorequoted above. See 881\nF.\u00a03d, at 492 (\u201cContrary toAtkins, the Ohio courts\noveremphasized Hill\u2019s adaptive strengths and relied too heavily on\nadaptive strengths that Hill exhibited in the controlled\nenvironment of his death-row prison cell. In so doing, they\nunreasonably applied clearly established law\u201d). Although the Court\nof Appeals asserted that the holding inMoorewas \u201cmerely an\napplication of what was clearly established byAtkins,\u201d 881\nF.\u00a03d, at 487, the court did not explain how the rule it\napplied can be teased out of theAtkinsCourt\u2019s brief\ncomments about the meaning of what it termed \u201cmental retardation.\u201d\nWhileAtkinsnoted that standard definitions of mental\nretardation included as a necessary element \u201csignificant\nlimitations in adaptive skills .\u00a0.\u00a0. that became manifest\nbefore age 18,\u201d 536 U.\u00a0S., at 318,Atkinsdid not\ndefinitively resolve how that element was to be evaluated but\ninstead left its application in the first instance to the States.Id., at 317.Moreover, the posture in whichMoorereached this Court (it did not arise under AEDPA) and theMooremajority\u2019s primary reliance on medical literature that\npostdated the Ohio courts\u2019 decisions, 581 U.\u00a0S.,at\n___, ___, provide additional reasons to question the Court of\nAppeals\u2019 analysis. Cf.Cainv.Chappell, 870\nF.\u00a03d 1003, 1024, n.\u00a09 (CA9 2017) (because \u201cMooreis not an AEDPA case\u201d and was \u201cdecided just this spring,\u201d\n\u201cMooreitself cannot serve as \u2018clearly established\u2019 law at\nthe time the state court decided Cain\u2019s claim\u201d).IVThe centrality ofMoorein the Court of\nAppeals\u2019 analysis is reflected in the way in which the\nintellectual-disability issue was litigated below. TheAtkinsportion of Hill\u2019s habeas petition did not focus on\n\u00a72254(d)(1), the provision on which the decision below is\nbased.[2] Instead, it began and\nended with appeals to a different provision of the habeas statute,\n\u00a72254(d)(2), which supports relief based on a state court\u2019s\n\u201cunreasonable determination of the facts.\u201d In particular, Hill\nopened with the claim that the Ohio courts\u2019 findings on \u201cadaptive\nfunctioning\u201d \u201cwere an unreasonable determination of the facts in\nlight of the evidence,\u201d Amended Pet. for Habeas Corpus in No.\n96\u2013CV\u2013795 (ND Ohio) (Doc. 94), p. 15, \u00b644 (citing \u00a72254(d)(2)), and\nhe closed with the claim that the state trial court\u2019s assessment\nthat he is \u201cnot mentally retarded\u201d was based on \u201can unreasonable\ndetermination of the facts,\u201did.,at 36\u201337, \u00b6101 (citing\n\u00a72254(d)(2)). Indeed, Hill\u2019s reply to the State\u2019s answer to his\npetition explicitly \u201cconcur[red] .\u00a0.\u00a0. that it is proper\nto review [hisAtkinsclaim] under \u00a72254(d)(2).\u201d Traverse in\nNo. 96\u2013CV\u2013795 (ND Ohio) (Doc. 102), p. 47. And so, unsurprisingly,\nthe District Court analyzed Hill\u2019sAtkinsclaim solely under\n\u00a72254(d)(2), noting that \u201c[a]s Hill concedes in his Traverse, hisAtkinsclaim is more appropriately addressed as it relates\nto the Ohio appellate court\u2019s factual analysis under \u00a72254(d)(2).\u201d\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 121a.Hill pressed the same \u00a72254(d)(2) argument in\nhis opening brief in the Sixth Circuit. There, he argued that the\nstate courts\u2019 finding on \u201cadaptive functioning .\u00a0.\u00a0. was\nan unreasonable determination of the facts.\u201d Brief for\nPetitioner\u2013Appellant in No. 14\u20133718 (CA6), p. 34 (citing\n\u00a72254(d)(2)); see alsoid.,at 65 (\u201cAs such, the state\ncourts\u2019 findings of fact that [Hill] is not mentally retarded\nconstitute an unreasonable determination of facts in light of the\nevidence presented. (\u00a72254(d)(2))\u201d).It appears that it was not until the Court of\nAppeals asked for supplemental briefing onMoorethat Hill\nintroduced the \u00a72254(d)(1) argument that the Court of Appeals\nadopted. Although, as noted, the Court of Appeals ultimately\ndisclaimed reliance onMoore, it explicitly asked the\nparties for supplemental briefing on howMoore\u201cshould be\napplied to this case.\u201d Because the reasoning of the Court of\nAppeals leans so heavily onMoore, its decision must be\nvacated. On remand, the court should determine whether its\nconclusions can be sustained based strictly on legal rules that\nwere clearly established in the decisions of this Court at the\nrelevant time.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*The petition for certiorari and Hill\u2019s motion\nfor leave to proceedin forma pauperisare granted, the\njudgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth\nCircuit is vacated, and the case is remanded for further\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.Notes1The Court explained that\nit was \u201cfair to say that a national consensus\u201d had developed\nagainst the execution of \u201cmentally retarded\u201d offenders.Atkinsv.Virginia, 536 U.\u00a0S., 304, 316\n(2002).2While Hill\u2019s petition\nargued at one point that certain unidentified \u201cprocedures\u201d used by\nthe state courts in making the relevant decisions \u201cviolated clearly\nestablished federal law ofFord/Panetti/Atkins,\u201d Amended\nPet. for Habeas Corpus in No. 96\u2013CV\u2013795 (ND Ohio) (Doc. 94), p. 15,\n\u00b645, the petition plainly did not encompass his current argument\nthat the Ohio Court of Appeals unreasonably applied clearly\nestablished law underAtkinsby overemphasizing adaptive\nstrengths and improperly considering his prison\nbehavior.",
