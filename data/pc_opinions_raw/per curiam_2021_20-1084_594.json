    "text": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESJefferson S. Dunn, Commissioner, Alabama\nDepartment of Correctionsv.Matthew Reeveson petition for writ of certiorari to the\nunited states court of appeals for the eleventh circuitNo. 20\u20131084.\u2003Decided July 2, 2021Per Curiam.Willie Johnson towed Matthew Reeves\u2019 broken-down\ncar back to the city after finding Reeves stranded on an Alabama\ndirt road. In payment for this act of kindness, Reeves murdered\nJohnson, stole his money, and mocked his dying spasms. Years after\nbeing convicted of murder and sentenced to death, Reeves sought\nstate postconviction relief, arguing that his trial counsel should\nhave hired an expert to develop sentencing-phase mitigation\nevidence of intellectual disability. But despite having the burden\nto rebut the strong presumption that his attorneys made a\nlegitimate strategic choice, Reeves did not callanyof them\nto testify. The Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals denied relief,\nstressing that lack of evidence about counsel\u2019s decisions impeded\nReeves\u2019 efforts to prove that they acted unreasonably.Reevesv.State, 226 So. 3d 711, 750\u2013751 (2016).On federal habeas review, the Eleventh Circuit\nheld that this analysis was not only wrong, but indefensible. In an\nunpublished,per curiamopinion that drew heavily on a\ndissent from denial of certiorari, the Eleventh Circuit\nreinterpreted the Alabama court\u2019s lengthy opinion as imposing a\nsimpleper\u00a0seprohibition on relief in all cases where\na prisoner fails to question his counsel.Reevesv.Commissioner,Ala. Dept. of Corrections, 836 Fed.\nAppx. 733, 744\u2013747 (2020). It was the Eleventh Circuit, however,\nthat went astray in its \u201creadiness to attribute error.\u201dWoodfordv.Visciotti,537 U.S.\n19, 24 (2002) (per\u00a0curiam). Federal habeas courts\nmust defer to reasonable state-court decisions, 28\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72254(d), and the Alabama court\u2019s treatment of\nthe spotty record in this case was consistent with this Court\u2019s\nrecognition that \u201cthe absence of evidence cannot overcome the\nstrong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct fell within the wide\nrange of reasonable professional assistance.\u201dBurtv.Titlow,571 U.S.\n12, 23 (2013) (internal quotation marks and brackets\nomitted).IIn November 1996, Reeves and some friends\ndecided to \u201cgo out looking for some robberies.\u00a0\u201dReeves, 226 So. 3d, at 719 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). The group\u2019s initial target was a drug dealer in a nearby\ntown, but their car broke down and left them stranded on the side\nof the road. A few hours later, however, Johnson happened to drive\nby in his truck and offered to tow the disabled vehicle to Reeves\u2019\nhouse.After they arrived, Reeves, who was riding in\nthe bed of the truck, stuck a shotgun through the rear window of\nthe cab and shot Johnson in the neck. As Johnson sat slumped in the\ndriver\u2019s seat \u201cbleeding heavily and making gagging noises,\u201d Reeves\ndirected the rest of the group to \u201cgo through Johnson\u2019s pockets to\nget his money.\u201dId., at 720 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Throughout the rest of the day, Reeves repeatedly\n\u201cbrag[ged] about having shot Johnson,\u201d boasting that the murder\n\u201cwould earn him a \u2018teardrop,\u2019 a gang tattoo acquired for killing\nsomeone.\u201dIbid.(internal quotation marks omitted). And at a\nparty that night, Reeves invented a dance in which he \u201cpretend[ed]\nto pump a shotgun\u201d and \u201cjerk[ed] his body around in a manner\nmocking the way that Willie Johnson had died.\u201dIbid.(brackets and internal quotation marks omitted).Alabama charged Reeves with murder and appointed\ncounsel for him. His attorneys took several steps to develop\nmitigating evidence, including exploring the possibility that\nReeves was intellectually disabled. For example, they obtained\nextensive records of Reeves\u2019 educational, medical, and correctional\nhistory. Counsel also requested funding to hire a\nneuropsychologist, Dr. John Goff, to evaluate Reeves and prepare\nmitigation evidence. And when the trial court initially rejected\nthat request, counsel successfully sought reconsideration.After the court granted funding, Reeves\u2019\nattorneys managed to acquire additional mental-health records from\nthe State, including documents related to a pretrial competency\nevaluation that featured a partial administration of an IQ\ntest.[1] The totality of the\nevidence reflected that Reeves had a troubled childhood, suffered\nfrom numerous behavioral difficulties, and was within the\n\u201cborderline\u201d range of intelligence. While in school\u2014before being\nexpelled for violence and misbehavior\u2014he had been referred to\nspecial services for emotional conflict and behavioral issues. But\nReeves\u2019 records also showed that he had previously beendeniedspecial educational services for intellectual\ndisability. Counsel also learned that Reeves had attended classes\nand earned certificates in welding, masonry, and automotive\nmechanics. And the psychologist who initially evaluated Reeves\nlater opined that he was not intellectually disabled.At some point before trial, Reeves\u2019 attorneys\napparently elected to pursue other mitigation strategies instead of\nhiring Dr. Goff. The record does not reveal the exact reason for\nthis decision\u2014likely because Reeves did not ask them to testify.\nThe record does show, however, that counsel presented a holistic\nmitigation case. For example, counsel called several witnesses at\nsentencing\u2014including Reeves\u2019 mother and the psychologist who\nperformed the competency evaluation\u2014and elicited testimony about\nReeves\u2019 turbulent childhood, neglectful family, and educational\ndifficulties. The jury, however, recommended a death sentence.Reeves later sought postconviction relief in\nstate court, alleging almost 20 theories of error. Relevant here,\nhe asserted that he was categorically exempt from execution by\nreason of intellectual disability, seeAtkinsv.Virginia,536 U.S.\n304(2002), or at the very least that counsel should have hired\nDr. Goff to develop mitigation along those lines for use at\nsentencing, seePorterv.McCollum,558 U.S.\n30(2009) (per\u00a0curiam). At a 2-day hearing in state\ncourt, Reeves called two experts, including Dr. Goff. The doctor\nconcluded that Reeves was intellectually disabled, explaining that\nthe so-called Flynn Effect\u2014a controversial theory involving the\ninflation of IQ scores over time\u2014required adjusting Reeves\u2019 score\ndownward into the 60s.[2] Dr.\nGoff also cited a number of behavioral assessments that supposedly\nshowed Reeves\u2019 shortcomings in adaptive functioning. For its part,\nthe State offered the expert testimony of Dr. King, who\nadministered his own evaluation and concluded that Reeves was not\nintellectually disabled. In fact, Dr. King pointed out that Reeves\nhad a leadership role in a drug-dealing group and earned as much as\n$2,000 a week.Despite Reeves\u2019 focus on his attorney\u2019s\nperformance, he did not give them the opportunity to explain their\nactions. Although all three of his lawyers apparently were alive\nand available, Reeves did not call them to testify.The trial court denied relief, and the Alabama\nCourt of Criminal Appeals affirmed. First, it agreed that Reeves\nhad failed to prove that he was actually intellectually disabled\nand thus exempt from execution.Reeves, 226 So. 3d, at 744.\nThe court specifically addressed Dr. Goff\u00a0\u2019s reliance on the\nFlynn Effect, reiterating that this approach \u201chas not been accepted\nas scientifically valid by all courts\u201d and was \u201cnot settled in the\npsychological community.\u201dId., at 739 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). In fact, even Dr. Goff had \u201cadmitted that he did\nnot use the \u2018Flynn Effect\u2019 for over 20 years after it was first\ndiscovered.\u201dIbid.Second, the court rejected Reeves\u2019 claim that\ncounsel should have hired an expert to develop mitigating evidence\nof intellectual disability. Stressing that an attorney\u2019s decision\nnot to hire an expert is \u201ctypically [a] strategic decisio[n]\u201d that\nwill \u201cnot constitute per\u00a0se deficient performance,\u201d the court\nlooked to the record to assess the \u201creasoning behind counsel\u2019s\nactions.\u201dId., at 750, 751 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). In this case, the court observed, \u201cthe record [was]\nsilent as to th[ose] reasons\u201d \u201cbecause Reeves failed to call his\ncounsel to testify.\u201dId., at 751 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Hence, he could not overcome the \u201cpresumption of\neffectiveness\u201d that courts must afford to trial counsel.Ibid.(internal quotation marks omitted).Reeves sought certiorari, which we denied over a\ndissent.Reevesv.Alabama, 583 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2017)\n(opinion of Sotomayor, J.). The dissent acknowledged that the\n\u201cabsence of counsel\u2019s testimony may make it more difficult for a\ndefendant to meet his burden\u201d of proving deficient performance, but\nstill would have reversed and remanded because it understood the\nAlabama court to have applied \u201ca categorical rule that counsel must\ntestify in order for a petitioner to succeed on a federal\nconstitutional ineffective- assistance-of-counsel claim.\u201dId., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 2, 9). Although the dissent\ncited no decision in which this Court reprimanded a state court for\ntaking that approach, it reasoned that such a rule was contrary to\ndecisions in which this Court had \u201cfound deficient performancedespite[attorney] testimony, based on a review of the full\nrecord.\u201dId., at ___ (slip op., at 9).[3]Reeves next sought federal habeas review. The\nDistrict Court denied relief, but the Eleventh Circuit reversed in\npart. Like every court before it, the Eleventh Circuit first\nrejected Reeves\u2019 claim that he was intellectually disabled. 836\nFed. Appx., at 741. But, it held that his lawyers were\nconstitutionally deficient for not developing more evidence of\nintellectual disability and that this failure might have changed\nthe outcome of the trial.In reaching that result, the Eleventh Circuit\nexplained that it owed no deference to the \u201cunreasonable\u201d decision\nof the Alabama court. \u00a72254(d). Quoting at length from the earlier\ndissent from denial of certiorari, the panel reasoned that \u201caper\u00a0serule that the petitioner must present counsel\u2019s\ntestimony\u201d was clearly contrary to federal law.Id., at\n744\u2013747. And, to demonstrate that the Alabama court had applied\nsuch a rule, the Eleventh Circuit excised a single statement from a\nlengthy block quote: \u201c\u00a0\u2018[T]o overcome the strong presumption\nof effectiveness, a [state] petitioner must, at his evidentiary\nhearing, question trial counsel regarding his actions and\nreasoning.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId., at 744 (emphasis deleted). The\nEleventh Circuit then reasoned that the state court surely must\nhave imposed this \u201ccategorical rule\u201d because its opinion also said\nthat Reeves\u2019 \u201c\u00a0\u2018failure to call his attorneys to testify was\nfatal to his claims.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIbid.(emphasis deleted;\nbrackets omitted). But that quote was not quite complete; the\noriginal sentence reads, \u201cIn this case, Reeves\u2019s failure to\ncall his attorneys to testify is fatal to his claims of ineffective\nassistance of counsel.\u201dReeves, 226 So. 3d, at 749 (emphasis\nadded).IIThis case presents a simple question: Did the\nAlabama court violate clearly established federal law when it\nrejected Reeves\u2019 claim that his attorneys should have hired an\nexpert?In answering this question, we owe deference to\nboth Reeves\u2019 counselandthe state court. As to counsel, we\nhave often explained that strategic decisions\u2014including whether to\nhire an expert\u2014are entitled to a \u201cstrong presumption\u201d of\nreasonableness.Harringtonv.Richter,562 U.S.\n86, 104 (2011). Defense lawyers have \u201climited\u201d time and\nresources, and so must choose from among \u201c\u00a0\u2018countless\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nstrategic options.Id., at 106\u2013107. Such decisions are\nparticularly difficult because certain tactics carry the risk of\n\u201charm[ing] the defense\u201d by undermining credibility with the jury or\ndistracting from more important issues.Id., at 108.The burden of rebutting this presumption \u201crests\nsquarely on the defendant,\u201d and \u201c[i]t should go without saying that\nthe absence of evidence cannot overcome [it].\u201dTitlow, 571\nU.\u00a0S., at 22\u201323. In fact, even if there is reason to think\nthat counsel\u2019s conduct \u201cwas far from exemplary,\u201d a court still may\nnot grant relief if \u201c[t]he record does not reveal\u201d that counsel\ntook an approach that no competent lawyer would have chosen.Id., at 23\u201324.This analysis is \u201cdoubly deferential\u201d when, as\nhere, a state court has decided that counsel performed adequately.Id., at 15 (internal quotation marks omitted); see alsoSextonv.Beaudreaux, 585 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___\u2013___\n(2018) (per\u00a0curiam) (slip op., at 7\u20138) (deference is\n\u201cnear its apex\u201d in such cases). A federal court may grant habeas\nrelief only if a state court violated \u201cclearly establishedFederal law, as determined bythe Supreme Courtof the\nUnited States.\u201d \u00a72254(d)(1) (emphasis added). This \u201cwide latitude\u201d\nmeans that federal courts can correct only \u201cextreme malfunctions in\nthe state criminal justice syste[m].\u201dRichter, 562\nU.\u00a0S., at 102, 106 (internal quotation marks omitted). And in\nreviewing the work of their peers, federal judges must begin with\nthe \u201cpresumption that state courts know and follow the law.\u201dWoodford, 537 U.\u00a0S., at 24. Or, in more concrete terms,\na federal court may grant relief only ifevery\u201c\u00a0\u2018fairminded juris[t]\u2019\u00a0\u201d would agree thateveryreasonable lawyer would have made a different decision.Richter, 562 U.\u00a0S., at 101.A straightforward application of these\nprinciples reveals the extent of the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s error. We\nstart, as we must, with the case as it came to the Alabama court.\nReeves had filed a 100-plus-page brief alleging manifold errors,\nincluding several theories of ineffective assistance of counsel.Reeves, 226 So. 3d, at 749\u2013750, and n.\u00a016. Many of\nthese attacked basic strategic choices, including his current\nargument that counsel should have hired Dr. Goff to develop\nadditional evidence of intellectual disability. Yet, despite\nReeves\u2019 determination to find fault with his lawyers, he offered no\ntestimony or other evidence from them.That omission was particularly significant given\nthe \u201crange of possible reasons [Reeves\u2019] counsel may have had for\nproceeding as they did.\u201dCullenv.Pinholster,563 U.S.\n170, 196 (2011) (internal quotation marks omitted). This is not\na case in which a lawyer \u201cfailed to uncover and presentanyevidence of [Reeves\u2019] mental health or mental impairment, [or] his\nfamily background.\u201dPorter, 558 U.\u00a0S., at 40 (emphasis\nadded). Counsel\u2019s initial enthusiasm to collect Reeves\u2019 records and\nobtain funding hardly indicates professional neglect and\ndisinterest.Rather, we simply do not know what information\nand considerations emerged as counsel reviewed the case and refined\ntheir strategy. The attorneys may very well have pored over the\nvoluminous evidence in their possession\u2014including those obtainedaftertheir funding request\u2014and identified several reasons\nthat a jury was unlikely to be persuaded by a claim of intellectual\ndisability. After all, although Reeves\u2019 records suggested that his\nintelligence was below average, they also indicated that he was not\nintellectually disabled.E.g., 226 So. 3d, at 729. Counsel\nmight also have been concerned about the evidence of Reeves\u2019\nhistory of violence, criminal past, and behavior problems,ibid., and concluded that presenting these characteristics\nalongside a full-throated intellectual-disability argument would\nhave convinced the jury that Reeves \u201cwas simply beyond\nrehabilitation,\u201dPinholster, 563 U.\u00a0S., at 201. Or,\ncounsel may have uncovered additional evidence confirming their\nconcerns about an intellectual-disability strategy. Perhaps Reeves\ninformed them, as he later did Dr. King, that he was savvy enough\nto earn thousands of dollars a week in a drug- dealing operation\nwhere he had a leadership role. 226 So. 3d, at 736.Or, counsel may well have further investigated\nDr. Goff and decided that his debatable methodologies would\nundermine credibility with a local jury\u2014possibly a prescient choice\ngiven thatevery single courtto consider the issue has\nrejected Reeves\u2019 claim of intellectual disability. In fact, around\nthe time that counsel were formulating their trial strategy, Dr.\nGoff was already performing questionable evaluations. See,e.g.,Kingv.Apfel, 2000 WL 284217, *2 (SD\nAla., Feb. 29, 2000) (Dr. Goff\u00a0\u2019s 1996 evaluation of a Social\nSecurity claimant was \u201cunsupported by the medical evidence,\u201d and\n\u201ceverything elsein the record [was] counter to [his]\nextreme findings\u201d (emphasis added));Smallv.Apfel,\n2000 WL 1844727, *3, n.\u00a05 (SD Ala., Oct. 17, 2000) (\u201c[Dr.]\nGoff\u00a0\u2019s [1998] conclusions regarding deficits in adaptive\nbehavior are not only mere guesses .\u00a0.\u00a0. but also suffer\nfrom a lack of support in the record\u201d). It is not unreasonable for\na lawyer to be concerned about overreaching.Simply put, if the attorneys had been given the\nchance to testify, they might have pointed to information\njustifying the strategic decision to devote their time and efforts\nelsewhere. Yet, Reeves\u2014possibly pursuing a strategy of his\nown\u2014declined to put that testimonial evidence before the Alabama\ncourt. So given that the Alabama court was entitled to reject\nReeves\u2019 claim if trial counsel had any \u201cpossible reaso[n]\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. for proceeding as they did,\u201dPinholster, 563\nU.\u00a0S., at 196 (internal quotation marks omitted), it surely\nwas not obliged to accept Reeves\u2019 blanket assertion on an\nincomplete evidentiary record that \u201c[n]o reasonable strategy could\nsupport counsel\u2019s failure,\u201d ECF Doc. 23\u201329, at 81.Rather than defer to this commonsense analysis,\nthe Eleventh Circuit took a path that we have long foreclosed:\n\u201cmischaracterization of the state-court opinion.\u201dWoodford,\n537 U.\u00a0S., at 22. As explained above, the Alabama court\nreasonably concluded that the incomplete evidentiary record\u2014which\nwas notably \u201csilent as to the reasons trial counsel .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nchose not to hire Dr. Goff or another neuropsychologist\u201d\u2014doomed\nReeves\u2019 belated efforts to second-guess his attorneys.Reeves, 226 So. 3d, at 751. The Eleventh Circuit, however,\nrecharacterized this case-specific analysis as a \u201ccategorical rule\u201d\nthatanyprisoner willalwayslose if he fails to\ncall and question \u201ctrial counsel regarding his or her actions and\nreasoning.\u201d 836 Fed. Appx., at 744 (emphasis deleted; internal\nquotation marks omitted).We think it clear from context that the Alabama\ncourt did not apply a blanket rule, but rather determined that the\nfacts of this case did not merit relief. As an initial matter, the\nAlabama court twice recognized that therecanbe instances\nof \u201cper\u00a0sedeficient performance.\u201dReeves, 226\nSo. 3d, at 750\u2013751. It simply concluded that here, counsel\u2019s choice\nregarding experts involved a strategic decision entitled to a\npresumption of reasonableness.Ibid.Moreover,otherportions of the opinion\u2019s lengthy recitation of the law (which the\nEleventh Circuit omitted) belie a categorical approach. In\nparticular, the court twice said that it would consider \u201c\u00a0\u2018all\nthe circumstances\u2019\u00a0\u201d of the case, and it qualified its\nsupposedly categorical rule by explaining that \u201ccounsel shouldordinarilybe afforded an opportunity to explain his actions\nbefore being denounced as ineffective.\u201dId., at 744, 747\n(emphasis added; some internal quotation marks omitted).Other parts of the opinion yield the same\ninterpretation. For example, the court devoted almost nine pages to\ndiscussing ineffective assistance of counsel. That would have been\na curious choice for a \u201cbusy state cour[t]\u201d if a single sentence\napplying aper\u00a0serule could have sufficed.Johnsonv.Williams,568 U.S.\n289, 298 (2013) (state courts need not even \u201cdiscuss separately\nevery single claim\u201d). Within that lengthy discussion, the court\nindividually mentioned many of Reeves\u2019 specific theories, including\nhis current intellectual-disability argument. Moreover, that the\ncourt in a footnote summarily rejecteddifferentineffective- assistance-of-counsel claims for procedural reasons\nfurther weighs against imputing aper\u00a0serule for the\ntheories that the court discussed in the body of its opinion.Reeves, 226 So. 3d, at 749\u2013750, n.\u00a016.Even more important, the actual analysis of the\nclaim at issue here reflects a case-specific approach. The court\ndid not merely say, as the Eleventh Circuit wrongly suggested, that\nReeves\u2019 \u201c\u00a0\u2018failure to call his attorneys to testify was fatal\nto his claims.\u2019\u00a0\u201d 836 Fed. Appx., at 744 (brackets omitted).\nRather, the opinion prefaced this quote with an important\nqualifier\u2014\u201cIn this case.\u201dReeves, 226 So. 3d, at 749\n(emphasis added). And sure enough, the court proceeded to explain\nwhy Reeves could not prevail \u201cin this case\u201d\u2014because \u201cthe record\n[was] silent as to the reasoning behind counsel\u2019s actions.\u201dId., at 751 (internal quotation marks omitted). To be sure,\nthe record in this particular case happened to be deficient\n\u201cbecause Reeves failed to call his counsel to testify.\u201dIbid.But, this unremarkable observation of cause and effect\nin light of the facts before the court was hardly an absolute bar\nineverycase whereotherrecord evidence might fill\nin the details. And, it certainly was not contrary to clearly\nestablished law given that this Court and the Eleventh Circuit have\nmade the same observation that a silent record cannot discharge a\nprisoner\u2019s burden.E.g.,Titlow, 571 U.\u00a0S., at\n15, 22\u201324;Graysonv.Thompson,257 F.3d 1194, 1218 (CA11 2001) (noting that \u201cthe record [was]\nsilent as to why trial counsel did not pursue a motion to suppress\nthe evidence,\u201d and that \u201chabeas counsel did not inquire as to trial\ncounsel\u2019s reasons for not raising such a claim\u201d).[4]*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*For the foregoing reasons, we grant the\npetition for a writ of certiorari, reverse the judgment of the\nCourt of Appeals, and remand the case for proceedings consistent\nwith this opinion.It is so ordered.Justice Breyer dissents.Notes1Around the same time, one\nof Reeves\u2019 attorneys withdrew from the case, explaining that Reeves\n\u201cha[d] been combative, argumentative[,] and ha[d] totally refused\nto assist [the attorney] in any manner.\u201d Electronic Case Filing in\nNo. 1:17\u2013cv\u201300061 (SD Ala.) (ECF), Doc. 23\u20131, pp.\u00a03, 78.\nAnother attorney replaced him.2According to some\nproponents of this theory, the Flynn Effect posits that IQ scores\nincrease \u201cby approximately 0.3 points per year,\u201d which in turn\n\u201crequires that the IQ test be \u2018normed\u2019 periodically so that the\nmean score on the test stays the same\u201d and \u201cthat 0.3 points be\ndeducted from [a] full-scale IQ score achieved on an IQ test for\neach year since the test was last normed.\u201dReevesv.State, 226 So. 3d 711, 730 (Ala. Crim. App.\n2016).3We note that this\ndissent\u2014unlike the Eleventh Circuit\u2014considered the case before it\nentered the exceedingly deferential posture of federal habeas\nreview. Moreover, the dissent didnotconclude that Reeves\nwas entitled to relief on the merits of his claim, but instead\nwould have \u201cremand[ed] so that the [Alabama court] could explain\nwhy, given the full factual record, Reeves\u2019 counsel\u2019s choices\nconstituted reasonable performance.\u201d 583 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 14).4Today\u2019s dissent suggests\nthat a more recent decision\u2014Statev.M.D.D., ___ So.\n3d ___, 2020 WL 6110694 (Ala. Crim. App., Oct. 16,\n2020)\u2014illustrates that Alabama courts understandReevesto\nannounce aper\u00a0serule.Post, at 6\u20139, and\nn.\u00a04 (opinion of Sotomayor, J.). But that case does the exact\nopposite. InM.D.D., the petitioner alleged that his\nattorney should have called a medical expert at trial, yet he did\nnot have the attorney testify at the postconviction hearing. 2020\nWL 6110694, *5\u2013*6.
