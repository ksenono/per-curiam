    "text": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESCNH INDUSTRIAL N.V., et\u00a0al.v.JACK REESE, et\u00a0al.on petition for writ of certiorari to the\nunited states court of appeals for the sixth circuitNo. 17\u2013515.\u2003Decided February 20, 2018Per Curiam.Three Terms ago, this Court\u2019s decision inM&G Polymers USA, LLCv.Tackett, 574 U.\u00a0S.\n___ (2015), held that the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit\nwas required to interpret collective-bargaining agreements\naccording to \u201cordinary principles of contract law.\u201dId.,at\n___ (slip op., at 1). BeforeTackett, the Sixth Circuit\napplied a series of \u201cYard-Maninferences,\u201d stemming from its\ndecision inInternational Union, United Auto, Aerospace, &\nAgricultural Implement Workers of Am.v.Yard-Man, Inc.,\n716 F. 2d 1476 (1983). In accord with theYard-Maninferences, courts presumed, in a variety of circumstances, that\ncollective-bargaining agreements vested retiree benefits for life.\nSeeTackett, 574 U.\u00a0S., at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 7\u201310).\nButTackett\u201creject[ed]\u201d these inferences \u201cas inconsistent\nwith ordinary principles of contract law.\u201dId., at ___ (slip\nop., at 14).In this case, the Sixth Circuit held that the\nsameYard-Maninferences it once used to presume lifetime\nvesting can now be used to render a collective-bargaining agreement\nambiguous as a matter of law, thus allowing courts to consult\nextrinsic evidence about lifetime vesting. 854 F.\u00a03d 877,\n882\u2013883 (2017). This analysis cannot be squared withTackett. A contract is not ambiguous unless it is subject to\nmore than one reasonable interpretation, and theYard-Maninferences cannot generate a reason- able interpretation because\nthey are not \u201cordinary principles of contract law,\u201dTackett,supra, at ___ (slip op., at 14). Because the Sixth Circuit\u2019s\nanalysis is \u201cYard-Manre-born, re-built, and re-purposed for\nnew adventures,\u201d 854 F. 3d, at 891 (Sutton, J., dissenting), we\nreverse.IAThis Court has long held that\ncollective-bargaining agreements must be interpreted \u201caccording to\nordinary principles of contract law.\u201dTackett, 574\nU.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 7) (citingTextile Workersv.Lincoln Mills of Ala., 353 U.\u00a0S. 448 \u2013457 (1957)).\nPrior toTackett, the Sixth Circuit purported to follow this\nrule, but it used a unique series of \u201cYard-Maninferences\u201d\nthat no other circuit applied. 574 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at\n7).For example, the Sixth Circuit presumed that \u201ca general\ndurational clause\u201d in a collective-bargaining agreement\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018says nothingabout the vesting of retiree\nbenefits\u2019\u00a0\u201d in that agreement.Id.,at ___\u2013___ (slip\nop., at 9\u201310) (quotingNoev.PolyOne Corp., 520\nF.\u00a03d 548, 555 (CA6 2008)). If the collective-bargaining\nagreement lacked \u201ca termination provision specifically addressing\nretiree benefits\u201d but contained specific termination provisions for\nother benefits, the Sixth Circuit presumed that the retiree\nbenefits vested for life.Tackett,supra, at ___\u2013___\n(slip op., at 7\u20138) (citingYard-Man,supra, at 1480).\nThe Sixth Circuit also presumed vesting if \u201ca provision\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. \u2018tie[d] eligibility for retirement-health benefits\nto eligibility for a pension.\u201d 574 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at\n10) (quotingNoe,supra, at 558).This Court\u2019s decision inTackett\u201creject[ed] theYard-Maninferences as inconsistent with\nordinary principles of contract law.\u201d 574 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 14). Most obviously, theYard-Maninferences\nerroneously \u201crefused to apply general durational clauses to\nprovisions governing retiree benefits.\u201d 574 U.\u00a0S., at ___\n(slip op., at 12). This refusal \u201cdistort[ed] the text of the\nagreement and conflict[ed] with the principle of contract law that\nthe written agreement is presumed to encompass the whole agreement\nof the parties.\u201dIbid.TheYard-Maninferences also incorrectly\ninferred lifetime vesting whenever \u201ca contract is silent as to the\nduration of retiree benefits.\u201d 574 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at\n14). The \u201ctraditional principle,\u201dTackettexplained, is that\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018contractual obligations will cease, in the ordinary course,\nupon termination of the bargaining agreement.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId.,at ___ (slip op., at 13) (quotingLitton Financial Printing\nDiv., Litton Business Systems, Inc.v.NLRB, 501\nU.\u00a0S. 190, 207 (1991) ). \u201c[C]ontracts that are silent as to\ntheir duration will ordinarily be treated not as \u2018operative in\nperpetuity\u2019 but as \u2018operative for a reasonable time.\u2019\u00a0\u201d 574\nU.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 13) (quoting 3 A. Corbin, Corbin\non Contracts \u00a7553, p. 216 (1960)). In fact, the Sixth Circuit had\nfollowed this principle in cases involving noncollectively\nbargained agreements, seeSpraguev.General Motors\nCorp., 133 F.\u00a03d 388, 400 (1998) (en banc), which \u201conly\nunderscore[d]Yard-Man\u2019s deviation from ordinary principles\nof contract law.\u201dTackett,supra, at ___ (slip op.,\nat 13).As for the tying of retiree benefits to\npensioner status,Tackettrejected thisYard-Maninference as \u201ccontrary to Congress\u2019 determination\u201d in the Employee\nRetirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), 88Stat. 891. 574\nU.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 11). The Sixth Circuit adopted\nthis inference on the assumption that retiree health benefits are\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018a form of delayed compensation or reward for past\nservices,\u2019\u00a0\u201d like a pension.Id.,at ___ (slip op., at\n4) (quotingYard-Man,supra,at 1482). But ERISA\ndistinguishes between plans that \u201cresul[t] in a deferral of\nincome,\u201d \u00a71002(2)(A)(ii), and plans that offer medical benefits,\n\u00a71002(1)(A). SeeTackett, 574 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 11).Tackettthus concluded that this and the other\n\u201cinferences applied inYard-Manand its progeny\u201d do not\n\u201crepresent ordinary principles of contract law.\u201dId.,at ___\n(slip op., at 10).BLikeTackett, this case involves a\ndispute between retirees and their former employer about whether an\nexpired collective-bargaining agreement created a vested right to\nlifetime health care benefits. In 1998, CNH Industrial N.\u00a0V.\nand CNH Industrial America LLC (collectively, CNH) agreed to a\ncollective-bargaining agreement. The 1998 agreement provided health\ncare benefits under a group benefit plan to certain \u201c[e]mployees\nwho retire under the .\u00a0.\u00a0. Pension Plan.\u201d App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. A\u2013116. \u201cAll other coverages,\u201d such as life insurance,\nceased upon retirement.Ibid.The group benefit plan was\n\u201cmade part of\u201d the collective-bargaining agreement and \u201cr[an]\nconcurrently\u201d with it.Id.,at A\u2013114. The 1998 agreement\ncontained a general durational clause stating that it would\nterminate in May 2004.Id.,at A\u2013115. The agreement also\nstated that it \u201cdispose[d] of any and all bargaining issues,\nwhether or not presented during negotiations.\u201dIbid.When the 1998 agreement expired in 2004, a class\nof CNH retirees and surviving spouses (collectively, the retirees)\nfiled this lawsuit, seeking a declaration that their health care\nbenefits vested for life and an injunction preventing CNH from\nchanging them. While their lawsuit was pending, this Court decidedTackett. Based onTackett, the District Court\ninitially awarded summary judgment to CNH. But after\nreconsideration, it awarded summary judgment to the retirees. 143\nF.\u00a0Supp.\u00a03d 609 (ED Mich. 2015).The Sixth Circuit affirmed in relevant part. 854\nF.\u00a03d, at 879. The court began by noting that the 1998\nagreement was \u201csilent\u201d on whether health care benefits vested for\nlife.Id.,at 882. Although the agreement contained a\ngeneral durational clause, the Sixth Circuit found that clause\ninconclusive for two reasons. First, the 1998 agreement \u201ccarved out\ncertain benefits\u201d like life insurance \u201cand stated that those\ncoverages ceased at a time different than other provisions.\u201dIbid.; see App. to Pet. for Cert. A\u2013116. Second, the 1998\nagreement \u201ctied\u201d health care benefits to pension eligibility. 854\nF.\u00a03d, at 882; see App. to Pet. for Cert. A\u2013116. These\nconditions rendered the 1998 agreement ambiguous, according to the\nSixth Circuit, which allowed it to consult extrinsic evidence. 854\nF.\u00a03d, at 883. And that evidence supported lifetime vesting.Ibid.The Sixth Circuit acknowledged that these features of\nthe agreement are the same ones it used to \u201cinfer vesting\u201d underYard-Man, but it concluded that nothing inTackettprecludes this kind of analysis: \u201cThere is surely a difference\nbetween finding ambiguity from silence and finding vesting from\nsilence.\u201d 854 F.\u00a03d, at 882.[1]Judge Sutton dissented. Seeid.,at\n887\u2013893. He concluded that the 1998 agreement was unambiguous\nbecause \u201cthe company never promised to provide healthcare benefits\nfor life, and the agreement contained a durational clause that\nlimitedallof the benefits.\u201dId.,at 888. Judge\nSutton noted that, in finding ambiguity, the panel major- ity\nrelied on the same inferences that this Court proscribed inTackett. See 854 F.\u00a03d, at 890\u2013891. But ambiguity, he\nexplained, requires \u201ctwo competing interpretations, both of which\nare fairly plausible,\u201did.,at 890, and \u201c[a] forbidden\ninference cannot generate a plausible reading,\u201did.,at 891.\nThe panel majority\u2019s contrary decision, Judge Sutton concluded,\u201cabrad[ed] an inter-circuit split (and an intra-circuit\nsplit) that the Supreme Court just sutured shut.\u201dId.,at\n890.[2]IIThe decision below does not comply withTackett\u2019sdirection to apply ordinary contract principles.\nTrue, one such principle is that, when a contract is ambiguous,\ncourts can consult extrinsic evidence to determine the parties\u2019\nintentions. See 574 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (Ginsburg, J., concurring)\n(slip op., at 1) (citing 11 R. Lord, Williston on Contracts \u00a730:7,\npp. 116\u2013124 (4th ed. 2012) (Williston)). But a contract is not\nambiguous unless, \u201cafter applying established rules of\ninterpretation, [it] remains reasonably susceptible to at least two\nreasonable but conflicting meanings.\u201dId., \u00a730:4, at 53\u201354\n(footnote omitted). Here, that means the 1998 agreement was not\nambiguous unless it could reasonably be read as vesting health care\nbenefits for life.The Sixth Circuit read it that way only by\nemploying the inferences that this Court rejected inTackett. The Sixth Circuit did not point to any explicit\nterms, implied terms, or industry practice suggesting that the 1998\nagreement vested health care benefits for life. Cf. 574 U.\u00a0S.,\nat ___ (Ginsburg, J., concurring) (slip op., at 2). Instead, it\nfound ambiguity in the 1998 agreement by applying several of theYard-Maninferences: It declined to apply the general\ndurational clause to the health care benefits, and then it inferred\nvesting from the presence of specific termination provisions for\nother benefits and the tying of health care benefits to pensioner\nstatus.Tackettrejected those inferences\nprecisely because they are not \u201cestablished rules of\ninterpretation,\u201d 11\u00a0Williston \u00a730:4, at 53\u201354. TheYard-Maninferences \u201cdistort the text of the agreement,\u201d\nfail \u201cto apply general durational clauses,\u201d erroneously presume\nlifetime vesting from silence, and contradict how \u201cCongress\nspecifically defined\u201d key terms in ERISA.Tackett, 574\nU.\u00a0S., at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 11\u201314).Tackettthus\nrejected these inferences not because of theconsequencesthat the Sixth Circuit attached to them\u2014presuming vesting versus\nfinding ambiguity\u2014but because they are not a valid way to read a\ncontract. They cannot be used to create a reasonable interpretation\nany more than they can be used to create a presumptive one.Tellingly, no other Court of Appeals would find\nambigu- ity in these circumstances. When a collective-bargaining\nagreement is merely silent on the question of vesting, other courts\nwould conclude that it doesnotvest benefits for\nlife.[3] Similarly, when an\nagreement does not specify a duration for health care benefits in\nparticular, other courts would simply apply the general durational\nclause.[4] And other courts\nwould not find ambiguity from the tying of retiree benefits to\npensioner status.[5] The\napproach taken in these other decisions \u201conly underscores\u201d how the\ndecision below \u201cdeviat[ed] from ordinary principles of contract\nlaw.\u201dTackett,supra, at ___ (slip op., at 13).Shorn ofYard-Maninferences, this case\nis straightforward. The 1998 agreement contained a general\ndurational clause that applied to all benefits, unless the\nagreement specified otherwise. No provision specified that the\nhealth care benefits were subject to a different durational clause.\nThe agreement stated that the health benefits plan \u201cr[an]\nconcurrently\u201d with the collective-bargaining agreement, tying the\nhealth care benefits to the duration of the rest of the agreement.\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. A\u2013114. If the parties meant to vest health\ncare benefits for life, they easily could have said so in the text.\nBut they did not. And they specified that their agreement\n\u201cdispose[d] of any and all bargaining issues\u201d between them.Id.,at A\u2013115. Thus, the only reasonable interpretation of\nthe 1998 agree- ment is that the health care benefits expired when\nthe collective-bargaining agreement expired in May 2004. \u201cWhen the\nintent of the parties is unambiguously expressed in the contract,\nthat expression controls, and the court\u2019s inquiry should proceed no\nfurther.\u201dTackett,supra, at ___ (Ginsburg, J.,\nconcurring) (slip op., at 1) (citing 11 Williston \u00a730:6, at\n98\u2013104).*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*Because the decision below is not consistent\nwithTackett, the petition for a writ of certiorari and the\nmotions for leave to file briefsamici curiaeare granted.\nWe reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case\nfor further proceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.Notes1After accepting the\nretirees\u2019 reading of the 1998 agreement, the Sixth Circuit remanded\nfor the District Court to reconsider the reasonableness of CNH\u2019s\nproposed modifications to the health care benefits. See 854 F. 3d\n877, 884\u2013887 (2017). CNH does not challenge that determination, and\nwe express no view on it.2By \u201cintra-circuit split,\u201d\nJudge Sutton was referring to the Sixth Circuit\u2019s earlier decision\ninGallov.Moen Inc., 813 F.\u00a03d 265 (2016).\nThat decision concluded that a collective-bargaining agreement did\nnot vest health care benefits for life, relying on the general\ndurational clause and rejecting the same inferences that the Sixth\nCircuit invoked here. Seeid.,at 269\u2013272. The conflict\nbetween these decisions, and others like them, has led one judge in\nthe Sixth Circuit to declare that \u201c[o]ur post-Tackettcase\nlaw is a mess.\u201dInternational Union, United Auto, Aerospace\n& Agricultural Implement Workers of Am.v.Kelsey-Hayes\nCo., 872 F.\u00a03d 388, 390 (2017) (Griffin, J., dissenting\nfrom denial of rehearing en banc). To date, the en banc Sixth\nCircuit has been unwilling (or unable) to reconcile its precedents.\nSeeibid.(Sutton, J., concurring in denial of rehearing en\nbanc) (agreeing that this conflict \u201cwarrants en banc review\u201d but\nvoting against it because \u201cthere is a real possibility that we\nwould not have nine votes for any one [approach]\u201d).3See,e.g.,International Union, United Auto, Aerospace & Agricul-tural\nImplement Workers of Am.v.Skinner Engine Co., 188\nF.\u00a03d 130, 147 (CA3 1999);Joycev.Curtiss-Wright\nCorp., 171 F.\u00a03d 130, 135 (CA2 1999);Wisev.El\nPaso Natural Gas Co., 986 F.\u00a02d 929, 938 (CA5 1993);Sennv.United Dominion Industries, Inc., 951\nF.\u00a02d 806, 816 (CA7 1992).4See,e.g., Des Moines\nMailers Union, Teamsters Local No. 358v.NLRB, 381\nF.\u00a03d 767, 770 (CA8 2004);Skinner Engine Co., 188\nF.\u00a03d, at 140\u2013141.5See,e.g., id.,at\n141;Joyce,supra, at 134;Andersonv.Alpha Portland Industries, Inc., 836 F.\u00a02d 1512, 1517\n(CA8 1988).",
