Petitioners allege that submitting this\nnotice substantially burdens the exercise of their religion, in\nviolation of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993,\n107Stat. 1488, 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72000bbet seq.Following oral argument, the Court requested\nsupplemental briefing from the parties addressing \u201cwhether\ncontraceptive coverage could be provided to petitioners\u2019 employees,\nthrough petitioners\u2019 insurance companies, without any such notice\nfrom petitioners.\u201dPost, p.___.Both petitioners and\nthe Government now confirm that such an option is feasible.\nPetitioners have clarified that their religious exercise is not\ninfringed where they \u201cneed to do nothing more than contract for a\nplan that does not include coverage for some or all forms of\ncontraception,\u201d even if their employees receive cost-free\ncontraceptive coverage from the same insurance company.\nSupplemental Brief for Petitioners 4. The Government has confirmed\nthat the challenged procedures \u201cfor employers with insured plans\ncould be modified to operate in the manner posited in the Court\u2019s\norder while still ensuring that the affected women receive\ncontraceptive coverage seamlessly, together with the rest of their\nhealth coverage.\u201d Supplemental Brief for Respondents 14\u201315.In light of the positions asserted by the\nparties in their supplemental briefs, the Court vacates the\njudgments below and remands to the respective United States Courts\nof Appeals for the Third, Fifth, Tenth, and D.\u00a0C. Circuits.\nGiven the gravity of the dispute and the substantial clarification\nand refinement in the positions of the parties, the parties on\nremand should be afforded an opportunity to arrive at an approach\ngoing forward that accommodates petitioners\u2019 religious exercise\nwhile at the same time ensuring that women covered by petitioners\u2019\nhealth plans \u201creceive full and equal health coverage, including\ncontraceptive coverage.\u201dId., at 1. We anticipate that the\nCourts of Appeals will allow the parties sufficient time to resolve\nany outstanding issues between them.The Court finds the foregoing approach more\nsuitable than addressing the significantly clarified views of the\nparties in the first instance. Although there may still be areas of\ndisagreement between the parties on issues of implementation, the\nimportance of those areas of potential concern is uncertain, as is\nthe necessity of this Court\u2019s involvement at this point to resolve\nthem. This Court has taken similar action in other cases in the\npast. See,e.g., Madison Countyv.Oneida Indian Nation\nof N.\u00a0Y., 562 U.\u00a0S. 42, 43 (2011) (per curiam)\n(vacating and remanding for the Second Circuit to \u201caddress, in the\nfirst instance, whether to revisit its ruling on sovereign immunity\nin light of [a] new factual development, and\u2014if necessary\u2014proceed\nto address other questions in the case consistent with its\nsovereign immunity ruling\u201d);Kiyembav.Obama, 559\nU.\u00a0S. 131, 132 (2010) (per curiam) (vacating and\nremanding for the D.\u00a0C. Circuit to \u201cdetermine, in the first\ninstance, what further proceedings in that court or in the District\nCourt are necessary and appropriate for the full and prompt\ndisposition of the case in light of the new developments\u201d);Villarrealv.United States, 572 U.\u00a0S. ___\n(2014) (vacating and remanding to the Fifth Circuit \u201cfor further\nconsideration in light of the position asserted by the Solicitor\nGeneral in his brief for the United States\u201d).The Court expresses no view on the merits of the\ncases. In particular, the Court does not decide whether\npetitioners\u2019 religious exercise has been substantially burdened,\nwhether the Government has a compelling interest, or whether the\ncurrent regulations are the least restrictive means of serving that\ninterest.Nothing in this opinion, or in the opinions or\norders of the courts below, is to affect the ability of the\nGovernment to ensure that women covered by petitioners\u2019 health\nplans \u201cobtain, without cost, the full range of FDA approved\ncontraceptives.\u201dWheaton Collegev.Burwell, 573\nU.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 1). Through this\nlitigation, petitioners have made the Government aware of their\nview that they meet \u201cthe requirements for exemption from the\ncontraceptive coverage requirement on religious grounds.\u201dId.,at ___ (slip op., at 2). Nothing in this opinion, or in\nthe opinions or orders of the courts below, \u201cprecludes the\nGovernment from relying on this notice, to the extent it considers\nit necessary, to facilitate the provision of full contraceptive\ncoverage\u201d going forward.Ibid. Because the Government may\nrely on this notice, the Government may not impose taxes or\npenalties on petitioners for failure to provide the relevant\nnotice.The judgments of the Courts of Appeals are\nvacated, and the cases are remanded for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.",
