    "text": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESDeRAY MCKESSONv.JOHN DOEon petition for writ of certiorari to the\nunited states court of appeals for the fifth circuitNo.19\u20131108.\u2003Decided November 2, 2020Per Curiam.Petitioner DeRay Mckesson organized a\ndemonstration in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, to protest a shooting by a\nlocal police officer. The protesters, allegedly at Mckesson\u2019s\ndirection, occupied the highway in front of the police\nheadquarters. As officers began making arrests to clear the\nhighway, an unknown individual threw a \u201cpiece of concrete or a\nsimilar rock-like object,\u201d striking respondent Officer Doe in the\nface. 945 F.3d 818, 823 (CA5 2019). Officer Doe suffered\ndevastating injuries in the line of duty, including loss of teeth\nand brain trauma.Though the culprit remains unidentified, Officer\nDoe sought to recover damages from Mckesson on the theory that he\nnegligently staged the protest in a manner that caused the assault.\nThe District Court dismissed the negligence claim as barred by the\nFirst Amendment. 272 F.\u00a0Supp.\u00a03d 841, 847\u2013848 (MD La.\n2017).A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the\nFifth Circuit reversed. As the Fifth Circuit recognized at the\noutset, Louisiana law generally imposes no \u201c\u00a0\u2018duty to protect\nothers from the criminal activities of third persons.\u2019\u00a0\u201d 945\nF.\u00a03d, at 827 (quotingPosecaiv.Wal-Mart Stores,\nInc., 1999\u20131222, p.\u00a05 (La. 11/30/99), 752 So. 2d 762,\n766). But the panel majority held that a jury could plausibly find\nthat Mckesson breached his \u201cduty not to negligently precipitate the\ncrime of a third party\u201d because \u201ca violent confrontation with a\npolice officer was a foreseeable effect of negligently directing a\nprotest\u201d onto the highway. 945 F.\u00a03d, at 827. The dissent\nwould have demanded something more\u2014a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d between\nMckesson and Officer Doe\u2014before recognizing such a duty under\nLouisiana law.Id.,at 836\u2013838, and n.\u00a011 (Willett, J.,\nconcurring in part and dissenting in part). The dissent likewise\ndoubted that an intentional assault is the \u201cparticular risk\u201d for\nwhich Officer Doe could recover for a breach of \u201cLouisiana\u2019s\nprohibitions on highway-blocking,\u201d which \u201chave as their focus the\nprotection of other motorists.\u201dId.,at 844, n.\u00a056\n(internal quotation marks omitted).The panel majority also rejected Mckesson\u2019s\nargument thatNAACPv.Claiborne Hardware Co.,458 U.S.\n886(1982), forbids liability for speech-related activity that\nnegligently causes a violent act unless the defendant specifically\nintended that the violent act would result. According to the Fifth\nCircuit, the First Amendment imposes no barrier to tort liability\nso long as the rock-throwing incident was \u201cone of the\n\u2018consequences\u2019 of \u2018tortious activity,\u2019 which itself was\n\u2018authorized, directed, or ratified\u2019 by Mckesson in violation of his\nduty of care.\u201d 945 F.\u00a03d, at 829 (quotingClaiborne\nHardware, 458 U.\u00a0S., at 927). Because Mckesson allegedly\ndirected an unlawful obstruction of a highway, see La. Rev. Stat.\nAnn. \u00a714:97 (West 2018), the Fifth Circuit held that the First\nAmendment did not shield him from liability for the downstream\nconsequences. 945 F.\u00a03d, at 829. Again, the dissent disagreed,\ndeeming the \u201cnovel \u2018negligent protest\u2019 theory of liability\u201d to be\n\u201cincompatible with the First Amendment and foreclosed\u2014squarely\u2014by\u201dClaiborne Hardware. 945 F.\u00a03d, at 842 (opinion of\nWillett, J.).The Fifth Circuit subsequently deadlocked 8 to 8\non Mckesson\u2019s petition for rehearing en banc. 947 F.3d 874, 875\n(2020) (per\u00a0curiam). Members of the Court of Appeals\nwrote separately to express further disagreement with both the\npanel decision\u2019s interpretation of state law,id.,at 879\n(Higginson, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc), and\nits application ofClaiborne Hardware, 947 F.\u00a03d, at\n878 (Dennis, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc).The question presented for our review is whether\nthe theory of personal liability adopted by the Fifth Circuit\nviolates the First Amendment. When violence occurs during activity\nprotected by the First Amendment, that provision mandates\n\u201cprecision of regulation\u201d with respect to \u201cthe grounds that may\ngive rise to damages liability\u201d as well as \u201cthe persons who may be\nheld accountable for those damages.\u201dClaiborne Hardware, 458\nU.\u00a0S., at 916\u2013917 (internal quotation marks omitted). Mckesson\ncontends that his role in leading the protest onto the highway,\neven if negligent and punishable as a misdemeanor, cannot make him\npersonally liable for the violent act of an individual whose only\nassociation with him was attendance at the protest.We think that the Fifth Circuit\u2019s interpretation\nof state law is too uncertain a premise on which to address the\nquestion presented. The constitutional issue, though undeniably\nimportant, is implicated only if Louisiana law permits recovery\nunder these circumstances in the first place. The dispute thus\ncould be \u201cgreatly simplifie[d]\u201d by guidance from the Louisiana\nSupreme Court on the meaning of Louisiana law.Bellottiv.Baird,428 U.S.\n132, 151 (1976).Fortunately, the Rules of the Louisiana Supreme\nCourt, like the rules of 47 other States, provide an opportunity to\nobtain such guidance. In the absence of \u201cclear controlling\nprecedents in the decisions of the\u201d Louisiana Supreme Court, those\nRules specify that the federal courts of appeals may certify\ndispositive questions of Louisiana law on their own accord or on\nmotion of a party. La. Sup. Ct. Rule 12, \u00a7\u00a71\u20132 (2019).\nCertification is by no means \u201cobligatory\u201d merely because state law\nis unsettled; the choice instead rests \u201cin the sound discretion of\nthe federal court.\u201dLehman Brothersv.Schein,416 U.S.\n386, 391 (1974). Federal courts have only rarely resorted to\nstate certification procedures, which can prolong the dispute and\nincrease the expenses incurred by the parties. Seeid.,at\n394\u2013395 (Rehnquist, J., concurring). Our system of \u201ccooperative\njudicial federalism\u201d presumes federal and state courts alike are\ncompetent to apply federal and state law.Id.,at 391\n(opinion of the Court); cf.Tafflinv.Levitt,493 U.S.\n455, 465 (1990).In exceptional instances, however, certification\nis advisable before addressing a constitutional issue. SeeBellotti, 428 U.\u00a0S., at 151;Clayv.Sun Ins.\nOffice Ltd.,363 U.S.\n207, 212 (1960). Two aspects of this case, taken together,\npersuade us that the Court of Appeals should have certified to the\nLouisiana Supreme Court the questions (1)\u00a0whether Mckesson\ncould have breached a duty of care in organizing and leading the\nprotest and (2)\u00a0whether Officer Doe has alleged a particular\nrisk within the scope of protection afforded by the duty, provided\none exists. See 945 F.\u00a03d, at 839 (opinion of Willett,\nJ.).First, the dispute presents novel issues of\nstate law peculiarly calling for the exercise of judgment by the\nstate courts. SeeLehman Brothers, 416 U.\u00a0S., at 391.\nTo impose a duty under Louisiana law, courts must consider \u201cvarious\nmoral, social, and economic factors,\u201d among them \u201cthe fairness of\nimposing liability,\u201d \u201cthe historical development of precedent,\u201d and\n\u201cthe direction in which society and its institutions are evolving.\u201dPosecai, 752 So.\u00a02d, at 766. \u201cSpeculation by a federal\ncourt about\u201d how a state court would weigh, for instance, the moral\nvalue of protest against the economic consequences of withholding\nliability \u201cis particularly gratuitous when the state courts stand\nwilling to address questions of state law on certification.\u201dArizonans for Official Englishv.Arizona,520 U.S.\n43, 79 (1997) (internal quotation marks and alteration\nomitted).Second, certification would ensure that any\nconflict in this case between state law and the First Amendment is\nnot purely hypothetical. The novelty of the claim at issue here\nonly underscores that \u201c[w]arnings against premature adjudication of\nconstitutional questions bear heightened attention when a federal\ncourt is asked to invalidate a State\u2019s law.\u201dIbid.The\nLouisiana Supreme Court, to be sure, may announce the same duty as\nthe Fifth Circuit. But under the unusual circumstances we confront\nhere, we conclude that the Fifth Circuit should not have ventured\ninto so uncertain an area of tort law\u2014one laden with value\njudgments and fraught with implications for First Amendment\nrights\u2014without first seeking guidance on potentially controlling\nLouisiana law from the Louisiana Supreme Court. We express no\nopinion on the propriety of the Fifth Circuit certifying or\nresolving on its own any other issues of state law that the parties\nmay raise on remand.We therefore grant the petition for writ of\ncertiorari, vacate the judgment of the United States Court of\nAppeals for the Fifth Circuit, and remand the case to that court\nfor further proceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.justice barrett took no part in the\nconsideration or decision of this case.justice thomas dissents.",
