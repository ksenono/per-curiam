    "text": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESANTHONY RAY HINTONv.ALABAMAon petition for writ of certiorari to the\ncourt of criminal appeals of alabamaNo. 13\u20136440\u2003Decided February 24, 2014Per Curiam.InStricklandv.Washington,466\nU.S. 668(1984), we held that a criminal defendant\u2019s Sixth\nAmendment right to counsel is violated if his trial attorney\u2019s\nperformance falls below an objective standard of reasonableness and\nif there is a reasonable probability that the result of the trial\nwould have been different absent the deficient act or omission.Id.,at 687\u2013688, 694. Anthony Ray Hinton, an inmate on\nAlabama\u2019s death row, asks us to decide whether the Alabama courts\ncorrectly appliedStricklandto his case. We conclude that\nthey did not and hold that Hinton\u2019s trial attorney rendered\nconstitutionally deficient performance. We vacate the lower court\u2019s\njudgment and remand the case for reconsideration of whether the\nattorney\u2019s deficient performance was prejudicial.IAIn February 1985, a restaurant manager in\nBirming-ham was shot to death in the course of an after-hours\nrob-bery of his restaurant. A second manager was murdered duraing a\nvery similar robbery of another restaurant in July. Then, later in\nJuly, a restaurant manager named Smotherman survived another\nsimilar robbery-shooting. During each crime, the robber fired two\n.38 caliber bullets; all six bullets were recovered by police\ninvestigators. Smotherman described his assailant to the police,\nand when the police showed him a photographic array, he picked out\nHinton\u2019s picture.The police arrested Hinton and recovered from\nhis house a .38 caliber revolver belonging to his mother, who\nshared the house with him. After analyzing the six bullets fired\nduring the three crimes and test-firing the revolver, examiners at\nthe State\u2019s Department of Forensic Sciences concluded that the six\nbullets had all been fired from the same gun: the revolver found at\nHinton\u2019s house. Hinton was charged with two counts of capital\nmurder for the killings during the first two robberies. He was not\ncharged in connection with the third robbery (that is, the\nSmotherman robbery).At trial, the State\u2019s strategy was to link\nHinton to the Smotherman robbery through eyewitness testimony and\nforensic evidence about the bullets fired at Smotherman and then to\npersuade the jury that, in light of the similar-ity of the three\ncrimes and forensic analysis of the bullets and the Hinton\nrevolver, Hinton must also have committed the two murders.\nSmotherman identified Hinton as the man who robbed his restaurant\nand tried to kill him, and two other witnesses provided testimony\nthat tended to link Hinton to the Smotherman robbery. Hinton\nmaintained that he was innocent and that Smotherman had\nmisidentified him. In support of that defense, Hinton presented\nwitnesses who testified in support of his alibi that he was at work\nat a warehouse at the time of the Smotherman robbery. See548 So. 2d 562, 568\u2013569 (Ala. 1989) (summarizing the evidence\non each side of the case).The six bullets and the revolver were the only\nphysical evidence. Besides those items, the police found no\nevidence at the crime scenes that could be used to identify the\nperpetrator (such as fingerprints) and no incriminating evidence at\nHinton\u2019s home or in his car. The State\u2019s case turned on whether its\nexpert witnesses could convince the jury that the six recovered\nbullets had indeed been fired from the Hinton revolver. According\nto the Alabama Supreme Court, \u201cthe only evidence linking Hinton to\nthe two murders were forensic comparisons of the bullets recovered\nfrom those crime scenes to the Hinton revolver.\u201d 2008 WL 4603723,\n*2 (Oct. 17, 2008).The category of forensic evidence at issue in\nthis case is \u201cfirearms and toolmark\u201d evidence. Toolmark examiners\nattempt to determine whether a bullet recovered from a crime scene\nwas fired from a particular gun by comparing microscopic markings\n(toolmarks) on the recovered bullet to the markings on a bullet\nknown to have been fired from that gun. The theory is that minor\ndifferences even between guns of the same model will leave\ndiscernible traces on bullets that are unique enough for an\nexaminer to conclude that the recovered bullet was or was not fired\nfrom a given weapon. See generally National Research Council,\nStrengthening Forensic Science in the United States: A Path Forward\n150\u2013155 (2009).Recognizing that Hinton\u2019s defense called for an\neffective rebuttal of the State\u2019s expert witnesses, Hinton\u2019s\nattorney filed a motion for funding to hire an expert witness of\nhis own. In response, the trial judge granted $1,000 with this\nstatement:\u201c\u00a0\u2018I don\u2019t know as to what my\nlimitations are as for how much I can grant, but I can grant up to\n$500.00 in each case [that is, for each of the two murder charges,\nwhich were tried together] as far as I know right now and I\u2019m\ngranting up to $500.00 in each of these two cases for this. So if\nyou need additional experts I would go ahead and file on a separate\nform and I\u2019ll have to see if I can grant additional experts, but I\nam granting up to $500.00, which is the statutory maximum as far as\nI know on this and if it\u2019s necessary that we go beyond that then I\nmay check to see if we can, but this one\u2019s granted.\u2019\u00a0\u201d 2006 WL\n1125605, *59 (Ala. Crim. App., Apr. 28, 2006) (Cobb, J.,\ndissenting) (quoting Tr. 10).Hinton\u2019s attorney did not take the judge up on\nhis invitation to file a request for more funding.In fact, $500 per case ($1,000 total) wasnotthe statu-tory maximum at the time of Hinton\u2019s trial. An\nearlier version of the statute had limited state reimbursement of\nexpenses to one half of the $1,000 statutory cap on attorney\u2019s\nfees, which explains why the judge believed that Hinton was\nentitled to up to $500 for each of the two murder charges. SeeSmelleyv.State,564 So. 2d 74, 88 (Ala. Crim. App. 1990). But the relevant\nstatute had been amended to provide: \u201c\u00a0\u2018Counsel shall also be\nentitled to be reimbursed for any expenses reasonably incurred in\nsuch defense to be approved in advance by the trial court.\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nSeeDubosev.State,662 So. 2d 1156, 1177, n.\u00a05 (Ala. Crim. App. 1993)\n(quoting Ala. Code \u00a715\u201312\u201321(d) (1984)), aff\u2019d662 So. 2d 1189(Ala. 1995). That amendment went into effect on\nJune 13, 1984,Dubose,supra,at 1177, n. 5, which\nwas over a year before Hinton was arrested, so Hinton\u2019s trial\nattorney could have corrected the trial judge\u2019s mistaken belief\nthat a $1,000 limit applied and accepted his invitation to file a\nmotion for additional funds.The attorney failed to do so because he was\nhimself unaware that Alabama law no longer imposed a specific limit\nand instead allowed reimbursement for \u201cany expenses reasonably\nincurred.\u201d At an evidentiary hearing held on Hinton\u2019s\npostconviction petition, the following conversation occurred\nbetween a state attorney and Hinton\u2019s trial attorney:\u201cQ. You did an awful lot of work to try and\nfind what you believed to be a qualified expert in this case,\ndidn\u2019t you?\u201cA. Yes, sir, I did.\u201cQ. Would you characterize it that you did\neverything that you knew to do?\u201cA. Yes, sir, I think so.\u201cQ. And this case, did it come down to an\nunwillingness of experts to work for the price that you were able\nto pay?\u201cA. Yes, sir, I think it did.\u201cQ. So your failure to get an expert that you\nwould have been let\u2019s say a hundred percent satisfied with was not\na failure on your part to go out and do some act, it was a failure\nof the court to approve what you believed would have been\nsufficient funds?\u201cA. Well, putting it a little differently, yes,\nsir, it was a failure\u2014it was my failure, my inability under the\nstatute to obtain any more funding for the purpose of hiring\nqualified experts.\u201d Reporter\u2019s Official Tr. 206\u2013207 (emphasis\nadded).Operating under the mistaken belief that he\ncould pay no more than $1,000, Hinton\u2019s attorney went looking for\nan expert witness. According to his postconviction testimony, he\nmade an extensive search for a well-regarded expert, but found only\none person who was willing to take the case for the pay he could\noffer: Andrew Payne. Hinton\u2019s attorney \u201ctestified that Payne did\nnot have the expertise he thought he needed and that he did not\nconsider Payne\u2019s testimony to be effective.\u201d 2006 WL 1125605, *27.\nAs he told the trial judge during a pretrial hearing:\u201cI made an effort to get somebody that I\nthought would be useable. And I\u2019ll have to tell you what I did\n[about] Payne. I called a couple of other lawyers in town\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. to ask if they knew of anybody. One of them knew\nhim; one of them knew him. The reason I didn\u2019t contact him was\nbecause he wasn\u2019t recommended by the lawyer. So now I\u2019m stuck that\nhe\u2019s the only guy I could possibly produce.\u201dId.,at *30\n(internal quotation marks omitted).At trial, Payne testified that the toolmarks in\nthe barrel of the Hinton revolver had been corroded away so that it\nwould be impossible to say with certainty whether a particular\nbullet had been fired from that gun. He also testified that the\nbullets from the three crime scenes did not match one another. The\nState\u2019s two experts, by contrast, maintained that all six bullets\nhad indeed been fired from the Hinton revolver.On cross-examination, the prosecutor badly\ndiscredited Payne. Payne admitted that he\u2019d testified as an expert\non firearms and toolmark identification just twice in the preceding\neight years and that one of the two cases involved a shotgun rather\nthan a handgun. Payne also conceded that he had had difficulty\noperating the microscope at the state forensic laboratory and had\nasked for help from one of the state experts. The prosecutor ended\nthe cross-examination with this colloquy:\u201cQ. Mr. Payne, do you have some problem with\nyour vision?\u201cA. Why, yes.\u201cQ. How many eyes do you have?\u201cA. One.\u201d Tr. 1667.The prosecutor\u2019s closing argument highlighted\nthe fact that Payne\u2019s expertise was in military ordnance, not\nfirearms and toolmark identification, and that Payne had graduated\nin 1933 (more than half a century before the trial) with a degree\nin civil engineering, whereas the State\u2019s experts had years of\ntraining and experience in the field of firearms and toolmark\nexamination. The prosecutor said:\u201c\u00a0\u2018I ask you to reject [Payne\u2019s]\ntestimony and you have that option because you are the judges of\nthe facts and whose testimony, Mr. Yates\u2019 or Mr. Payne\u2019s, you will\ngive credence to, and I submit to you that as between these two men\nthere is no match between them. There is no comparison. One man\njust doesn\u2019t have it and the other does it day in and day out,\nmonth in and month out, year in and year out, and is recognized\nacross the state as an expert.\u2019\u00a0\u201d 2006 WL 1125605, *64 (Cobb,\nJ., dissenting) (quoting Tr. 1733\u20131734).The jury convicted Hinton and recommended by a\n10- to-2 vote that he be sentenced to death. The trial judge\naccepted that recommendation and imposed a death sentence.BIn his state postconviction petition, Hinton\ncontended that his trial attorney was \u201c\u00a0\u2018ineffective to not\nseek additional funds when it became obvious that the individual\nwilling to examine the evidence in the case for the $1,000 allotted\nby the court was incompetent and unqualified. Indeed, this failure\nto seek additional, sufficient funds is rendered all the more\ninexplicable by the trial court\u2019s express invitation to counsel to\nseek more funds if such funds were necessary.\u2019\u00a0\u201d 2006 WL\n1125605, *28.To show that he had been prejudiced by Payne\u2019s\nineffective testimony, Hinton produced three new experts on\ntoolmark evidence. One of the three, a forensic consultant named\nJohn Dillon, had worked on toolmark identification at the Federal\nBureau of Investigation\u2019s forensics laboratory and, from 1988 until\nhe retired in 1994, had served as chief of the firearms and\ntoolmark unit at the FBI\u2019s headquarters. The other two\npostconviction experts had worked for many years as firearms and\ntoolmark examiners at the Dallas County Crime Laboratory and had\neach testified as toolmark experts in several hundred cases.All three experts examined the physical evidence\nand testified that they could not conclude that any of the six\nbullets had been fired from the Hinton revolver. The State did not\nsubmit rebuttal evidence during the postconviction hearing, and one\nof Hinton\u2019s experts testified that, pursuant to the ethics code of\nhis trade organization, the Association of Firearm and Tool Mark\nExaminers, he had asked the State\u2019s expert, Yates, to show him how\nhe had determined that the recovered bullets had been fired from\nthe Hinton revolver. Yates refused to cooperate.CThe circuit court denied Hinton\u2019s\npostconviction petition on the ground that Hinton had not been\nprejudiced by Payne\u2019s allegedly poor performance because Payne\u2019s\ntestimony did not depart from what Hinton\u2019s postconviction experts\nhad said: The bullets could not be affirmatively matched either to\none another or to the Hinton revolver.The Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed\nby a 3-to-2 vote. 2006 WL 1125605. The court agreed with the\ncircuit court that Hinton had not been prejudiced because Payne\u2019s\ntestimony, if believed by the jury, strongly supported the\ninference that Hinton was innocent.Id.,at *31. Then-Judge\nCobb (who later became chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court)\ndissented. In her view, Hinton\u2019s attorney had been ineffective in\nfailing to seek additional funds to hire a better expert and Hinton\nhad been prejudiced by that failure, meaning that he was entitled\nto a new trial. Then-Judge Shaw (who is now a justice of the\nAlabama Supreme Court) also dissented. He would have remanded the\ncase to the circuit court to make a finding as to whether or not\nPayne was qualified to act as an expert on toolmark evidence. He\nstated that \u201c[i]t goes without saying that, with knowledge that\nsufficient funds were available to have a qualified firearms and\ntoolmarks expert, no reasonable criminal defense lawyer would seek\nout and hire an unqualified firearms witness.\u201dId.,at\n*73.The Supreme Court of Alabama reversed and\nremanded. 2008 WL 4603723. After quoting at length from Judge\nShaw\u2019s dissent, the Court stated, \u201cWe agree with Judge Shaw that\n\u2018the dispositive issue is whether Payne was a qualified firearms\nand toolmarks expert\u2019 and that in denying Hinton\u2019s [postconviction]\npetition the trial court did not directly rule on \u2018the issue\nwhether Payne was qualified to be testifying in the first\nplace.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId.,at *4 (quoting 2006 WL 1125605, *70, *72\n(Shaw, J., dissenting)). The Supreme Court was thus focused on\nPayne\u2019s own qualifications, rather than on whether a better\nexpert\u2014one who could have been hired had the attorney learned that\nthere was no funding cap and requested additional funds\u2014would have\nmade a more compelling case for Hinton.On remand, the circuit court held that Payne was\nindeed qualified to testify as a firearms and toolmark expert\nwitness under the Alabama evidentiary standard in place at the time\nof the trial, which required only that Payne have had \u201cknowledge of\nfirearms and toolmarks exam-ination beyond that of an average\nlayperson.\u201d 2008 WL 5517591, *5 (Ala. Crim. App., Dec. 19, 2008);\nsee alsoCharlesv.State,350 So. 2d 730, 733 (Ala. Crim. App. 1977) (\u201cAn \u2018expert\nwitness\u2019 is one who can enlighten a jury more than the average man\nin the street.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. An expert witness, by\ndefinition, is any person whose opportunity or means of knowledge\nin a specialized art or science is to some degree better than that\nfound in the average juror or witness\u201d). The appellate court\naffirmed the circuit court\u2019s ruling that Payne was qualified under\nthe applicable standard. 2013 WL 598122 (Ala. Crim. App., Feb. 15,\n2013). The Alabama Supreme Court denied review by a 4-to-3 vote,\nwith two justices recused. Hinton then filed this petition for a\nwrit of certiorari.IIThis case calls for a straightforward\napplication of our ineffective-assistance-of-counsel precedents,\nbeginning withStricklandv.Washington,466\nU.S. 668.Stricklandrecognized that the Sixth\nAmendment\u2019s guarantee that \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the\naccused shall enjoy the right .\u00a0.\u00a0. to have the\nAssistance of Counsel for his defence\u201d entails that defendants are\nentitled to be represented by an attorney who meets at least a\nminimal standard of competence.Id.,at 685\u2013687. \u201cUnderStrickland, we first determine whether counsel\u2019s\nrepresentation \u2018fell below an objective standard of\nreasonableness.\u2019 Then we ask whether \u2018there is a reasonable\nprobability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the\nresult of the proceeding would have been different.\u2019\u00a0\u201dPadillav.Kentucky,559 U.S.\n356, 366 (2010) (quotingStrickland,supra,at\n688, 694).A\u201cThe first prong\u2014constitutional deficiency\u2014is\nnecessarily linked to the practice and expectations of the legal\ncommunity: \u2018The proper measure of attorney performance remains\nsimply reasonableness under prevailing professional norms.\u2019\u00a0\u201dPadilla,supra,at 366 (quotingStrickland,supra,at 688). \u201cIn any case presenting an ineffectiveness\nclaim, the performance inquiry must be whether counsel\u2019s assistance\nwas reasonable considering all the circumstances.\u201dStrickland,supra,at 688. Under that standard, it\nwas unreasonable for Hinton\u2019s lawyer to fail to seek additional\nfunds to hire an expert where that failure was based not on any\nstrategic choice but on a mistaken belief that available funding\nwas capped at $1,000.\u201cCriminal cases will arise where the only\nreasonable and available defense strategy requires consultation\nwith experts or introduction of expert evidence.\u201dHarringtonv.Richter, 562 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at\n16). This was such a case. As Hinton\u2019s trial attorney recognized,\nthe core of the prosecution\u2019s case was the state experts\u2019\nconclusion that the six bullets had been fired from the Hinton\nrevolver, and effectively rebutting that case required a competent\nexpert on the defense side. Hinton\u2019s attorney also recognized that\nPayne was not a good expert, at least with respect to toolmark\nevidence. Nonetheless, he felt he was \u201cstuck\u201d with Payne because he\ncould not find a better expert willing to work for $1,000 and he\nbelieved that he was unable to obtain more than $1,000 to cover\nexpert fees.As discussed above, that belief was wrong:\nAlabama law in effect beginning more than a year before Hinton was\narrested provided for state reimbursement of \u201cany expenses\nreasonably incurred in such defense to be approved in advance by\nthe trial court.\u201d Ala. Code \u00a715\u201312\u201321(d). And the trial judge\nexpressly invited Hinton\u2019s attorney to file a request for further\nfunds if he felt that more funding was necessary. Yet the attorney\ndid not seek further funding.The trial attorney\u2019s failure to request\nadditional funding in order to replace an expert he knew to be\ninadequate because he mistakenly believed that he had received all\nhe could get under Alabama law constituted deficient performance.\nUnderStrickland, \u201cstrategic choices made after thorough\ninvestigation of law and facts relevant to plausible options are\nvirtually unchallengeable; and strategic choices made after less\nthan complete investigation are reasonable precisely to the extent\nthat reasonable professional judgments support the limitations on\ninvestigation. In other words, counsel has a duty to make\nreasonable investigations or to make a reasonable decision that\nmakes particular investigations unnecessary.\u201d 466 U.\u00a0S., at\n690\u2013691. Hinton\u2019s attorney knew that he needed more funding to\npresent an effective defense, yet he failed to make even the\ncursory investigation of the state statute providing for defense\nfunding for indigent defendants that would have revealed to him\nthat he could receive reimbursement not just for $1,000 but for\n\u201cany expenses reasonably incurred.\u201d An attorney\u2019s ignorance of a\npoint of law that is fundamental to his case combined with his\nfailure to perform basic research on that point is a quintessential\nexample of unreasonable performance underStrickland. See,e.g.,Williamsv.Taylor,529 U.S.\n362, 395 (2000) (finding deficient performance where counsel\n\u201cfailed to conduct an investigation that would have uncovered\nextensive records [that could be used for death penalty mitigation\npurposes], not because of any strategic calcu-lation but because\nthey incorrectly thought that state law barred access to such\nrecords\u201d);Kimmelmanv.Morrison,477 U.S.\n365, 385 (1986) (finding deficient performance where counsel\nfailed to conduct pretrial discovery and that failure \u201cwas not\nbased on \u2018strategy,\u2019 but on counsel\u2019s mistaken belie[f\u00a0] that\nthe State was obliged to take the initiative and turn over all of\nits inculpatory evidence to the defense\u201d).We wish to be clear that the inadequate\nassistance of counsel we find in this case does not consist of the\nhiring of an expert who, though qualified, was not qualified\nenough. The selection of an expert witness is a paradigmatic\nexample of the type of \u201cstrategic choic[e]\u201d that, when made \u201cafter\nthorough investigation of [the] law and facts,\u201d is \u201cvirtually\nunchallengeable.\u201dStrickland, 466 U.\u00a0S., at 690. We do\nnot today launch federal courts into examination of the relative\nqualifications of experts hired and experts that might have been\nhired. The only inadequate assistance of counsel here was the\ninexcusable mistake of law\u2014the unreasonable failure to understand\nthe resources that state law made available to him\u2014that caused\ncounsel to employ an expert thathe himselfdeemed\ninadequate.BHaving established deficient performance,\nHinton must also \u201cshow that there is a reasonable probability that,\nbut for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the\nproceeding would have been different. A reasonable probability is a\nprobability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201dId.,at 694. \u201cWhen a defendant challenges a conviction, the\nquestion is whether there is a reasonable probability that, absent\nthe errors, the factfinder would have had a reasonable doubt\nrespecting guilt.\u201dId.,at 695.The Court of Criminal Appeals held, and the\nState contends in its brief in opposition to certiorari, that\nHinton could not have been prejudiced by his attorney\u2019s use of\nPayne rather than a more qualified expert because Payne said all\nthat Hinton could have hoped for from a toolmark expert: that the\nbullets used in the crimes could not have been fired from the\nHinton revolver. See 2006 WL 1125605, *31 (\u201c[E]ven assuming that\ncounsel\u2019s apparent ignorance that the cap on expert expenses had\nbeen lifted constituted deficient performance\n.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0, the appellant has not shown that he was\nprejudiced by that deficient performance\u201d). It is true that Payne\u2019s\ntestimony would have done Hinton a lot of goodif the jury had\nbelieved it. But the jury did not believe Payne. And if there\nis a reasonable probability that Hinton\u2019s attorney would have hired\nan expert who would have instilled in the jury a reasonable doubt\nas to Hinton\u2019s guilt had the attorney known that the statutory\nfunding limit had been lifted, then Hinton was prejudiced by his\nlawyer\u2019s deficient performance and is entitled to a new trial.That the State presented testimony from two\nexperienced expert witnesses that tended to inculpate Hinton does\nnot, taken alone, demonstrate that Hinton is guilty. Prosecution\nexperts, of course, can sometimes make mistakes. Indeed, we have\nrecognized the threat to fair criminal trials posed by the\npotential for incompetent or fraudulent prosecution forensics\nexperts, noting that \u201c[s]erious deficiencies have been found in the\nforensic evidence used in criminal trials.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. One\nstudy of cases in which exon-erating evidence resulted in the\noverturning of criminal convictions concluded that invalid forensic\ntestimony contributed to the convictions in 60% of the cases.\u201dMelendez-Diazv.Massachusetts,557 U.S.\n305, 319 (2009) (citing Garrett & Neufeld, Invalid Forensic\nScience Testimony and Wrongful Convictions, 95 Va. L.\u00a0Rev. 1,\n14 (2009)). This threat is minimized when the defense retains a\ncompetent expert to counter the testimony of the prosecution\u2019s\nexpert witnesses; it is maximized when the defense instead fails to\nunderstand the resources available to it by law.Because no court has yet evaluated the prejudice\nquestion by applying the proper inquiry to the facts of this case,\nwe remand the case for reconsideration of whether Hinton\u2019s\nattorney\u2019s deficient performance was prejudicial underStrickland.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*The petition for certiorari and Hinton\u2019s\nmotion for leave to proceedin forma pauperisare granted,\nthe judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeals of Alabama is\nvacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not\ninconsistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.",
