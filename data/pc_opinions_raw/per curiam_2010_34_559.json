WILKINSv.OFFICER GADDYon petition for writ of certiorari to the united\nstates court of appeals for the fourth circuitNo. 08\u201310914.\u2003Decided February 22, 2010Per Curiam.InHudsonv.McMillian,503 U. S. 1, 4 (1992),\nthis Court held that \u201cthe use of excessive physical force against a\nprisoner may constitute cruel and unusual punishment [even] when\nthe inmate does not suffer serious injury.\u201d In this case, the\nDistrict Court dismissed a prisoner\u2019s excessive force claim based\nentirely on its determination that his injuries were \u201cde\nminimis.\u201d Because the District Court\u2019s approach, affirmed on\nappeal, is at odds withHudson\u2019s direction to decide\nexcessive force claims based on the nature of the force rather than\nthe extent of the injury, the petition for certiorari is granted,\nand the judgment is reversed.IIn March 2008, petitioner Jamey\nWilkins, a North Carolina state prisoner, filed suit in the United\nStates District Court for the Western District of North Carolina\npursuant to 42 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71983. Wilkins\u2019pro secomplaint alleged that, on June 13, 2007, he was \u201cmaliciously and\nsadistically\u201d assaulted \u201c[w]ithout any provocation\u201d by a\ncorrections officer, respondent Gaddy.[Footnote 1] App. to Pet. for Cert. C\u20134. According to the\ncomplaint, Gaddy, apparently angered by Wilkins\u2019 request for a\ngrievance form, \u201csnatched [Wilkins] off the ground and slammed him\nonto the concrete floor.\u201dIbid. Gaddy \u201cthen proceeded to\npunch, kick, knee and choke [Wilkins] until another officer had to\nphysically remove him from [Wilkins].\u201dIbid. Wilkins\nfurther alleged that, \u201c[a]s a result of the excessive force used by\n[Gaddy], [he] sustained multiple physical injuries including a\nbruised heel, lower back pain, increased blood pressure, as well as\nmigraine headaches and dizziness\u201d and \u201cpsychological trauma and\nmental anguish including depression, panic attacks and nightmares\nof the assault.\u201dIbid.The District Court, on its own\nmotion and without a response from Gaddy, dismissed Wilkins\u2019\ncomplaint for failure to state a claim. Citing Circuit precedent,\nthe court stated that, \u201c[i]n order to state an excessive force\nclaim under the Eighth Amendment, a plaintiff must establish that\nhe received more than ade minimus[sic]injury.\u201d\nNo. 3:08\u2013cv\u201300138 (WD NC, Apr. 16, 2008), pp.\u00a01, 2 (citingTaylorv.McDuffie, 155 F. 3d 479, 483 (CA4\n1998);Rileyv.Dorton, 115 F. 3d 1159, 1166 (CA4\n1997) (en banc); footnote omitted). According to the court,\nWilkins\u2019 alleged injuries were no more severe than those deemedde minimisin the Circuit\u2019sTaylorandRileydecisions. Indeed, the court noted, Wilkins nowhere\nasserted that his injuries had required medical attention.In a motion for reconsideration, Wilkins\nstated that he was unaware that the failure to allege medical\ntreatment might prejudice his claim. He asserted that he had been\nprescribed, and continued to take, medication for his headaches and\nback pain, as well as for depression. And he attached medical\nrecords purporting to corroborate his injuries and course of\ntreatment.Describing reconsideration as \u201can\nextraordinary remedy,\u201d the court declined to revisit its previous\nruling. No. 3:08\u2013cv\u201300138 (WD NC, Aug. 25, 2008), p.\u00a01. The\nmedical records, the court observed, indicated that some of\nWilkins\u2019 alleged injuries \u201cwere pre-existing conditions.\u201dId., at 3. Wilkins had sought treatment for high blood\npressure and mental health issues even before the assault. The\ncourt acknowledged that Wilkins received an X ray after the\nincident \u201cto examine his \u2018bruised heel,\u2019 \u201d but it \u201cnote[d] that\nbruising is generally considered ade minimus[sic]injury.\u201dId., at 4. The court similarly\ncharacterized asde minimisWilkins\u2019 complaints of back\npain and headaches. The court denied Wilkins leave to amend his\ncomplaint. In a summary disposition, the Court of Appeals affirmed\n\u201cfor the reasons stated by the district court.\u201d No. 08\u20137881 (CA4,\nJan. 23, 2009).IIIn requiring what amounts to a\nshowing of significant injury in order to state an excessive force\nclaim, the Fourth Circuit has strayed from the clear holding of\nthis Court inHudson. Like Wilkins, the prisoner inHudsonfiled suit under \u00a71983 alleging that corrections\nofficers had used excessive force in violation of the Eighth\nAmendment. Evidence indicated that the officers had punched Hudson\nin the mouth, eyes, chest, and stomach without justification,\nresulting in \u201cminor bruises and swelling of his face, mouth, and\nlip\u201d as well as loosened teeth and a cracked partial dental plate.\n503 U. S., at 4. A Magistrate Judge entered judgment in Hudson\u2019s\nfavor, but the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed,\nholding that an inmate must prove \u201ca significant injury\u201d in order\nto state an excessive force claim.Hudsonv.McMillian, 929 F.\u00a02d 1014, 1015 (1990)(per\ncuriam). According to the Court of Appeals, Hudson\u2019s injuries,\nwhich had not required medical attention, were too \u201cminor\u201d to\nwarrant relief.Ibid.Reversing the Court of Appeals,\nthis Court rejected the notion that \u201csignificant injury\u201d is a\nthreshold requirement for stating an excessive force claim. The\n\u201ccore judicial inquiry,\u201d we held, was not whether a certain quantum\nof injury was sustained, but rather \u201cwhether force was applied in a\ngood-faith effort to maintain or restore discipline, or maliciously\nand sadistically to cause harm.\u201d 503 U. S., at 7; see alsoWhitleyv.Albers,475 U. S. 312, 319\u2013321\n(1986). \u201cWhen prison officials maliciously and sadistically use\nforce to cause harm,\u201d the Court recognized, \u201ccontemporary standards\nof decency always are violated \u2026 whether or not significant injury\nis evident. Otherwise, the Eighth Amendment would permit any\nphysical punishment, no matter how diabolic or inhuman, inflicting\nless than some arbitrary quantity of injury.\u201dHudson, 503\nU. S., at 9; see alsoid., at 13\u201314 (Blackmun, J.,\nconcurring in judgment) (\u201cThe Court today appropriately puts to\nrest a seriously misguided view that pain inflicted by an excessive\nuse of force is actionable under the Eighth Amendment only when\ncoupled with \u2018significant injury,\u2019e.g., injury that\nrequires medical attention or leaves permanent marks\u201d).This is not to say that the \u201cabsence of\nserious injury\u201d is irrelevant to the Eighth Amendment inquiry.Id., at 7. \u201c[T]he extent of injury suffered by an inmate\nis one factor that may suggest \u2018whether the use of force could\nplausibly have been thought necessary\u2019 in a particular situation.\u201dIbid.(quotingWhitley, 475 U. S., at 321). The\nextent of injury may also provide some indication of the amount of\nforce applied. As we stated inHudson, not \u201cevery\nmalevolent touch by a prison guard gives rise to a federal cause of\naction.\u201d 503 U. S., at 9. \u201cThe Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition of\n\u2018cruel and unusual\u2019 punishments necessarily excludes from\nconstitutional recognitionde minimisuses of physical\nforce, provided that the use of force is not of a sort repugnant to\nthe conscience of mankind.\u201dIbid.(some internal quotation\nmarks omitted). An inmate who complains of a \u201cpush or shove\u201d that\ncauses no discernible injury almost certainly fails to state a\nvalid excessive force claim.Ibid.(quotingJohnsonv.Glick, 481 F.\u00a02d 1028, 1033 (CA2\n1973)).Injury and force, however, are only\nimperfectly correlated, and it is the latter that ultimately\ncounts. An inmate who is gratuitously beaten by guards does not\nlose his ability to pursue an excessive force claim merely because\nhe has the good fortune to escape without serious injury.\nAccordingly, the Court concluded inHudsonthat the\nsupposedly \u201cminor\u201d nature of the injuries \u201cprovide[d] no basis for\ndismissal of [Hudson\u2019s] \u00a71983 claim\u201d because \u201cthe blows directed at\nHudson, which caused bruises, swelling, loosened teeth, and a\ncracked dental plate, are notde minimisfor Eighth\nAmendment purposes.\u201d 503 U. S., at 10.The allegations made by Wilkins in this case\nare quite similar to the facts inHudson, and the District\nCourt\u2019s analysis closely resembles the approachHudsondisavowed. Wilkins alleged that he was punched, kicked, kneed,\nchoked, and body slammed \u201cmaliciously and sadistically\u201d and\n\u201c[w]ithout any provocation.\u201d Dismissing Wilkins\u2019 actionsU.\nS.onte, the District Court did not hold that this purported\nassault, which allegedly left Wilkins with a bruised heel, back\npain, and other injuries requiring medical treatment, involvedde minimisforce. Instead, the court concluded that\nWilkins had failed to state a claim because \u201che simply has not\nalleged that he suffered anything more than de minimus[sic]injury.\u201d No. 3:08\u2013cv\u201300138 (WD NC, Apr. 16, 2008),\nat\u00a02.In giving decisive weight to the purportedlyde minimisnature of Wilkins\u2019 injuries, the District Court\nrelied on two Fourth Circuit cases. SeeRiley, 115\nF.\u00a03d, at 1166\u20131168;Taylor, 155 F.\u00a03d, at\n483\u2013485. Those cases, in turn, were based upon the Fourth Circuit\u2019s\nearlier decision inNormanv.Taylor, 25\nF.\u00a03d 1259 (1994) (en banc), which approved the practice of\nusing injury as a proxy for force. According to the Fourth Circuit,Hudson\u201cdoes not foreclose and indeed is consistent with\n[the] view \u2026 that, absent the most extraordinary circumstances, a\nplaintiff cannot prevail on an Eighth Amendment excessive force\nclaim if his injuries arede minimis.\u201d 25 F.\u00a03d, at\n1263.The Fourth Circuit\u2019s strained reading ofHudsonis not defensible. This Court\u2019s decision did not,\nas the Fourth Circuit would have it, merely serve to lower the\ninjury threshold for excessive force claims from \u201csignificant\u201d to\n\u201cnon-de minimis\u201d\u2014whatever those ill-defined terms might\nmean. Instead, the Court aimed to shift the \u201ccore judicial inquiry\u201d\nfrom the extent of the injury to the nature of the\nforce\u2014specifically, whether it was nontrivial and \u201cwas applied \u2026\nmaliciously and sadistically to cause harm.\u201d 503 U. S., at 7. To\nconclude, as the District Court did here, that the absence of \u201csome\narbitrary quantity of injury\u201d requires automatic dismissal of an\nexcessive force claim improperly bypasses this core inquiry.Id., at 9.[Footnote\n2]In holding that the District Court erred in\ndismissing Wilkins\u2019 complaint based on the supposedlyde\nminimisnature of his injuries, we express no view on the\nunderlying merits of his excessive force claim. In order to\nprevail, Wilkins will ultimately have to prove not only that the\nassault actually occurred but also that it was carried out\n\u201cmaliciously and sadistically\u201d rather than as part of \u201ca good-faith\neffort to maintain or restore discipline.\u201dIbid. Moreover,\neven if Wilkins succeeds, the relatively modest nature of his\nalleged injuries will no doubt limit the damages he may\nrecover.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*The petition for certiorari and\nthe motion for leave to proceedin forma pauperisare\ngranted. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the\ncase is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this\nopinion.It is so ordered.Footnote 1The materials in the record do not disclose\nGaddy\u2019s full name.Footnote 2Most Circuits to consider the issue have\nrejected the Fourth Circuit\u2019sde minimisinjury\nrequirement. See,e.g.,Wrightv.Goord,\n554 F.\u00a03d 255, 269\u2013270 (CA2 2009) (\u201c[O]ur Court has reversed\nsummary dismissals of Eighth Amendment claims of excessive force\neven where the plaintiff\u2019s evidence of injury was slight \u2026 . [T]he\nabsence of any significant injury to [the plaintiff] does not end\nthe Eighth Amendment inquiry, for our standards of decency are\nviolated even in the absence of such injury if the defendant\u2019s use\nof force was malicious or sadistic\u201d);Smithv.Mensinger, 293 F.\u00a03d 641, 648\u2013649 (CA3 2002) (\u201c[T]he\nEighth Amendment analysis must be driven by the extent of the force\nand the circumstances in which it is applied; not by the resulting\ninjuries. \u2026[D]e minimisinjuries do not necessarily\nestablishde minimis force\u201d);Oliverv.Keller, 289 F.\u00a03d 623, 628 (CA9 2002) (rejecting the\nview \u201cthat to support an Eighth Amendment excessive force claim a\nprisoner must have suffered from the excessive force a more thande minimisphysical injury\u201d (internal quotation marks\nomitted));United Statesv.LaVallee, 439\nF.\u00a03d 670, 687 (CA10 2006) (same).The Fifth Circuit has sometimes used language indicating\nagreement with the Fourth Circuit\u2019s approach. See,e.g.,Gomezv.Chandler, 163 F.\u00a03d 921, 924 (1999)\n(\u201c[T]o support an Eighth Amendment excessive force claim a prisoner\nmust have suffered from the excessive force a more thande\nminimisinjury\u201d). But seeBrownv.Lippard,\n472 F.\u00a03d 384, 386 (2006) (\u201cThis Court has never directly held\nthat injuries must reach beyond some arbitrary threshold to satisfy\nan excessive force claim\u201d). Even in the Fifth Circuit, however,\nWilkins likely would have survived dismissal for failure to state a\nclaim because that court\u2019s precedents have classified the sort of\ninjuries alleged here as non-de minimis. See,e.g.,ibid.(permitting a prisoner\u2019s Eighth\nAmendment excessive force claim to proceed to trial where evidence\nindicated that the prisoner suffered \u201cone-centimeter abrasions on\nboth his left knee and left shoulder, pain in his right knee, and\ntenderness around his left thumb,\u201d as well as \u201cback problems\u201d);Gomez, 163 F.\u00a03d, at 922 (refusing to grant summary\njudgment onde minimisinjury grounds where the prisoner\nalleged \u201cphysical pain [and] bodily injuries in the form of cuts,\nscrapes, [and] contusions to the face, head, and body\u201d).",
