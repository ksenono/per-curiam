S. ____ (2006)SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESMINISTRY OF DEFENSE AND SUPPORT FOR THE ARMED\nFORCES OF THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRANv.DARIUSH\nELAHIon petition for writ of certiorari to the united\nstates court of appeals for the ninth circuitNo. 04\u20131095.\u2003Decided February 21, 2006Per Curiam.A private citizen seeks to attach\nan asset belonging to Iran\u2019s Ministry of Defense in order to help\nsatisfy a judgment for money damages. The question raised is\nwhether the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (FSIA or Act),\n28 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71602et seq.(2000 ed. and Supp. III),\nforbids that attachment.The judgment for money damages consists of a\ndefault judgment against the Islamic Republic of Iran (for about\n$300 million) that the private citizen, Dariush Elahi, obtained in\na federal-court lawsuit claiming that the Republic had murdered his\nbrother.Elahiv.Islamic Republic of Iran, 124\nF.\u00a0Supp. 2d 97, 103 (DC 2000). The asset is an arbitration\naward (against a third party), which Iran\u2019s Ministry of Defense\nobtained in Switzerland.Ministry of Defense and Support for\nArmed Forces of Islamic Republic of Iranv.Cubic Defense\nSystems, Inc.,385 F.\u00a03d 1206, 1211 (CA9 2004). The\nMinistry asked the Federal District Court for the Southern District\nof California to confirm the award.Ministry of Defense and\nSupport for Armed Forces of Islamic Republic of Iranv.Cubic Defense Systems, Inc.,236 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d 1140\n(2002). The court did so. And Elahi then intervened, seeking to\nimpose a lien upon the award. The Ministry opposed the attachment\non the ground that the Act grants it immunity from such a\nclaim.The Federal District Court rejected the\nMinistry\u2019s immunity defense on the ground that, by suing to enforce\nthe award, the Ministry had waived any such immunity. On appeal the\nNinth Circuit disagreed with the District Court about waiver. But\nit then found against the Ministry on a different ground\u2014a ground\nthat the parties had not argued. The Act says that under certain\nconditions the property of an \u201cagency or instrumentality\u201d\nof a foreign government is \u201cnot \u2026 immune from attachment\u201d\nif the agency is \u201cengaged in commercial activity in the United\nStates.\u201d 28 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71610(b) (emphasis added). The Court of\nAppeals found that the Ministry engages in commercial activity and\nthat the other conditions were satisfied. 385 F.\u00a03d, at\n1219\u20131222 (applying \u00a71610(b)(2)). And it held that this section of\nthe Act barred the Ministry\u2019s assertion of immunity.Ibid.The Ministry filed a petition for certiorari\nasking us to review that decision. The Solicitor General agrees\nwith the Ministry that we should grant the writ but limited to the\nMinistry\u2019s Question 1, namely whether \u201cthe property of a foreign\nstatestricto sensu,situated in the United States\u201d is\n\u201cimmune from attachment \u2026 as provided in the Foreign Sovereign\nImmunities Act.\u201d Pet. for Cert. i (citing \u00a7\u00a71603(a), 1610(a)). The\nSolicitor General also asks us to vacate the judgment of the Court\nof Appeals and remand the case for consideration of whether the\nMinistry is simply a \u201cforeign state\u201d (what the Ministry\ncalls \u201ca foreign statestricto sensu\u201d) or whether the\nMinistry is an \u201cagency or instrumentality\u201d of a foreign\nstate (as the Ninth Circuit held). Brief for United States asAmicus Curiae15\u201317. We grant the writ limited to Question\n1.The Act, as it applies to the \u201cproperty in the\nUnited States of aforeign state,\u201d \u00a71610(a) (emphasis\nadded), doesnotcontain the \u201cengaged in commercial\nactivity\u201d exception that the Ninth Circuit described. That\nexception applies only where the property at issue is property of\nan \u201cagency or instrumentality\u201dof a foreign state. Compare\n\u00a71610(b) (\u201cproperty \u2026 of an agency or instrumentality of a foreign\nstate engaged in commercial activity\u201d) with \u00a71610(a) (\u201cproperty \u2026\nof a foreign stateused for a commercial activity\u201d)\n(emphasis added). The difference is critical. Moreover, in the\nSolicitor General\u2019s view a defense ministry (unlike, say, a\ngovernment-owned commercial enterprise) generally is not an \u201cagency\nor instrumentality\u201d of a foreign state but an inseparable part of\nthe state itself. Brief for United States asAmicus Curiae8\u201311; see alsoTransaero, Inc.v.La Fuerza Aerea\nBoliviana, 30 F.\u00a03d 148, 153 (CADC 1994) (\u201chold[ing] that\narmed forces are as a rule so closely bound up with the structure\nof the state that they must in all cases be considered as the\n\u2018foreign state\u2019 itself, rather than a separate \u2018agency or\ninstrumentality\u2019 of the state\u201d).We shall not now determine whether the\nSolicitor General is correct about the status of the Ministry, for\nthe Ninth Circuit did not address the question nor did the parties\nargue the matter before the Circuit. Neither can we fault the\nMinistry for that failure. As we said,supra, at 1, the\nDistrict Court based its denial of immunity upon waiver. The\nparties\u2019 Ninth Circuit briefs focused on matters not relevant here\n(such as the waiver question), with one exception. The exception\nconsists of a footnote in Elahi\u2019s brief mentioning the Act\u2019s\n\u201cagency and instrumentality\u201d provision. That footnote, however,\ndoes not ask for affirmance on that basis; nor did it provide the\nMinistry with clear notice that a reply was necessary. Answering\nBrief of Appellee in No. 03\u201355015 (CA9), p. 45, n. 27 (stating that\n\u201c[i]f[the Ministry] is considered \u2018an agency or\ninstrumentality of a foreign state,\u2019 rather than the foreign state\nitself, Mr. Elahi\u2019s attachment still is valid\u201d (emphasis\nadded)).The Ninth Circuit said that it was free to\naffirm on \u201cany ground supported by the record.\u201d 385 F.\u00a03d, at\n1219, n. 15. But the court did not explain what in the record might\ndemonstrate that the Ministry is an \u201cagency or instrumentality\u201d of\nthe state rather than an integral part of the state itself. The\ncourt noted that\u201cElahi appears to concede\u201d that the\nMinistry is an \u201cagency and instrumentality,\u201did., at 1218,\nn.\u00a013, but any relevant concession would have to have come\nfrom the Ministry, not from Elahi, whose position the concession\nfavors. Thus, in implicitly concluding that the Ministry was an\n\u201cagency or instrumentality\u201d of the Republic of Iran within the\nmeaning of \u00a71610(b), the Ninth Circuit either mistakenly relied on\na concession by respondent that could not possibly bind petitioner,\nor else erroneously presumed that there was no relevant distinction\nbetween a foreign state and its agencies or instrumentalities for\npurposes of that subsection. See \u00a71603(a), (b). Either way, the\nNinth Circuit committed error that was essential to its judgment in\nfavor of respondent.Because the Ninth Circuit did not consider,\nand the Ministry had no reasonable opportunity to argue, the\ncritical legal point we have mentioned, we vacate the judgment of\nthe Ninth Circuit, and remand the case for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.",
