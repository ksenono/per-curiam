    "text": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESJEFFREY WOODS, WARDENv.TIMOTHY\nETHERTONon petition for writ of certiorari to the\nunited states court of appeals for the sixth circuitNo. 15\u2013723.\u2003Decided April 4, 2016Per Curiam.In the fall of 2006, Michigan law enforcement\nreceived an anonymous tip that two white males were traveling on\nI\u201396 between Detroit and Grand Rapids in a white Audi, possibly\ncarrying cocaine. Officers spotted a vehicle matching that\ndescription and pulled it over for speeding. Respondent Timothy\nEtherton was driving; Ryan Pollie was in the passenger seat. A\nsearch of the car uncovered 125.2 grams of cocaine in a compartment\nat the bottom of the driver side door. Both Etherton and Pollie\nwere arrested.Etherton was tried in state court on a single\ncount of possession with intent to deliver cocaine. At trial the\nfacts reflected in the tip were not contested. The central point of\ncontention was instead whether the cocaine belonged to Etherton or\nPollie. Pollie testified for the prosecution pursuant to a plea\nagreement. He claimed that he had accompanied Etherton from Grand\nRapids to Detroit, not knowing that Etherton intended to obtain\ncocaine there. According to Pollie, once the pair arrived in\nDetroit, Etherton left him alone at a restaurant and drove off,\nreturning some 45 minutes later. It was only after they were headed\nback to Grand Rapids that Etherton revealed he had obtained the\ndrugs.The prosecution also called several police\nofficers to testify. Three of the officers described the content of\nthe anonymous tip leading to Etherton\u2019s arrest. On the third\nrecounting of the tip, Etherton\u2019s counsel objected on hearsay\ngrounds, but the objection was not resolved when the prosecutor\nagreed to move on. At closing, the prosecutor also described the\ntip. The court instructed the jury that \u201cthe tip was not evidence,\u201d\nbut was admitted \u201conly to show why the police did what they did.\u201d\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 88a. The jury convicted Etherton, and his\nconviction was affirmed on direct appeal. The Michigan Supreme\nCourt denied leave to appeal.Peoplev.Etherton, 483\nMich. 896, 760 N.W.2d 472 (2009).Etherton sought postconviction relief in state\ncourt on six grounds. Three are relevant here: First, he claimed\nthat the admission of the anonymous tip violated his rights under\nthe Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment. Second, that his\ntrial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the tip on\nthat ground. And third, that his counsel on direct appeal was\nineffective for failing to raise the Confrontation Clause and the\nineffective assistance of trial counsel claims.The state habeas court rejected the first two\nclaims on procedural grounds and the third on the merits. To\nprevail on a claim for ineffective assistance of appellate counsel,\nthe state court explained, Etherton had to demonstrate that\n\u201cappellate counsel\u2019s decision not to pursue an issue on appeal fell\nbelow an objective standard of reasonableness and that the\nrepresentation so prejudiced [him] as to deprive him of a fair\ntrial.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 87a\u201388a. The state court concluded\nthat Etherton failed on both counts.First, the court reasoned, appellate counsel may\nhave reasonably forgone any Confrontation Clause claim after\nconcluding that trial counsel\u2019s failure to object was the product\nnot of ineffectiveness but of strategy. While Etherton\u2019s current\ncounsel argues that trial counsel should have objected because the\ntip\u2019s reference to \u201ctwo men\u201d suggested involvement by Etherton from\nthe outset, Brief in Opposition 20\u201321, the reference also suggestedPollie\u2019sprior involvement, contrary to his testimony that\nhe was not with Etherton when he picked up the cocaine and had\nnothing to do with it. As the state court explained, not objecting\nwould have been consistent with trial counsel\u2019s \u201cstrategy to show\ndefendant\u2019s non-involvement and possible responsibility of the\npassenger (who was also charged).\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 88a.Second, the court determined, Etherton had not\nbeen prejudiced by counsel\u2019s choice: there was \u201cample evidence\u201d of\nhis guilt and \u201cthe complained of errors, even if true, would not\nhave changed the outcome\u201d of the case.Id.,at 89a.\nEtherton\u2019s allegations, the court concluded, ultimately failed to\novercome the presumption that his appellate counsel functioned\nreasonably in not pursuing the Confrontation Clause or\nineffectiveness claims.Ibid.Both the Michigan Court of\nAppeals and the Michigan Supreme Court denied leave to appeal.Etherton next sought federal habeas relief.\nUnder the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996\n(AEDPA), federal habeas relief was available to him only if the\nstate court\u2019s decision \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an\nunreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as\ndetermined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d 28\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72254(d)(1). \u201cA state court\u2019s determination that\na claim lacks merit precludes federal habeas relief so long as\n\u2018fairminded jurists could disagree\u2019 on the correctness of the state\ncourt\u2019s decision.\u201dHarringtonv.Richter,562 U.S.\n86, 101 (2011) (quotingYarboroughv.Alvarado,541 U.S.\n652, 664 (2004)). The state court decision must be \u201cso lacking\nin justification that there was an error well understood and\ncomprehended in existing law beyond any possibility for fairminded\ndisagreement.\u201dWhitev.Woodall, 572 U.\u00a0S. ___,\n___ (2014) (slip op., at 4) (internal quotation marks omitted).When the claim at issue is one for ineffective\nassistance of counsel, moreover, AEDPA review is \u201cdoubly\ndeferential,\u201dCullenv.Pinholster,563 U.S.\n170, 190 (2011), because counsel is \u201cstrongly presumed to have\nrendered adequate assistance and made all significant decisions in\nthe exercise of reasonable professional judgment,\u201dBurtv.Titlow, 571 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 9)\n(quotingStricklandv.Washington,466 U.S.\n668, 690 (1984); internal quotation marks omitted). In such\ncircumstances, federal courts are to afford \u201cboth the state court\nand the defense attorney the benefit of the doubt.\u201dBurt,\nsupra, at ___ (slip op., at 1).The District Court denied relief, but the Court\nof Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed in relevant part, over\nthe dissent of Judge Kethledge. The majority concluded that\nEtherton\u2019s appellate counsel had been constitution- ally\nineffective, and that no fairminded jurist could conclude\notherwise.Ethertonv.Rivard, 800 F.3d 737 (2015).\nWithout ruling on the merits of the court\u2019s holding that counsel\nhad been ineffective, we disagree with the determination that no\nfairminded jurist could reach a contrary conclusion, and\naccordingly reverse.In finding counsel ineffective, the majority\nfirst con- cluded that Etherton\u2019s right to confrontation had been\nvio- lated. The Confrontation Clause prohibits an out-of-court\nstatement only if it is admitted for its truth.Crawfordv.Washington,541 U.S.\n36, 60, n. 9 (2004). The Sixth Circuit determined that the\ncontents of the tip were admitted for their truth because the tip\nwas referenced by three different witnesses and mentioned in\nclosing argument. These \u201crepeated references both to the existence\nand the details of the content of the tip went far beyond what was\nnecessary for background,\u201d the majority below concluded,\n\u201cindicating the content of the tip was admitted for its truth.\u201d 800\nF.\u00a03d, at 751.The majority next found that Etherton had been\nprejudiced by the violation, a showing Etherton\u2019s state court\ncounsel would have had to make on appeal to obtain relief either on\nthe forfeited Confrontation Clause objection, seePeoplev.Carines, 460 Mich. 750, 763\u2013764,597 N.W.2d 130, 138\u2013139 (1999) (showing of prejudice required\nto overcome forfeiture), or the ineffectiveness claim,Strickland,supra, at 687 (showing of prejudice\nrequired to demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel). In\nfinding prejudice, the majority acknowledged the evidence of\nEtherton\u2019s guilt: the cocaine was found in a driver side\ncompartment inches from Etherton; he owned the car; and he was\ndriving at the time of arrest. But, according to the majority, that\nevidence was not enough to convict Etherton absent Pollie\u2019s\ntestimony. And that is where the tip came in. \u201cBecause much of\nPollie\u2019s testimony was reflected in the content of the tip that was\nput before the jury,\u201d the Sixth Circuit stated, \u201cthe jury could\nhave improperly concluded that Pollie was thereby testifying\ntruthfully\u2014that it was unlikely for it to be a coincidence for his\ntestimony to line up so well with the anonymous accusation.\u201d 800\nF.\u00a03d, at 753.In reaching these conclusions, the Sixth Circuit\ndid not apply the appropriate standard of review under AEDPA. A\n\u201cfairminded jurist\u201d could conclude that repetition of the tip did\nnot establish that the uncontested facts it conveyed were submitted\nfor their truth. Such a jurist might reach that conclusion by\nplacing weight on the fact that the truth of the facts was not\ndisputed. No precedent of this Court clearly forecloses that view.\nIt is also not beyond the realm of possibility that a fairminded\njurist could conclude that Etherton was not prejudiced when the tip\nand Pollie\u2019s testimony corresponded on uncontested facts. After\nall, Pollie himself was privy to all the information contained in\nthe tip. A reasonable judge might accord- ingly regard the fact\nthat the tip and Pollie\u2019s testimony corre- sponded to be\nunremarkable and not pertinent to Pollie\u2019s credibility. (In fact,\nthe only point of Pollie\u2019s testimony actually reflected in the tip\nwas that he and Etherton were traveling between Detroit and Grand\nRapids.)Etherton\u2019s underlying complaint is that his\nappellate lawyer\u2019s ineffectiveness meant he had \u201cno prior opportu-\nnity to cross-examine the anonymous tipster.\u201d Brief in Opposition\n11. But it would not be objectively unreason- able for a fairminded\njudge to conclude\u2014especially in light of the deference affordedtrialcounsel underStrickland\u2014that the failure to\nraise such a claim was not due to incompetence but because the\nfacts in the tip were uncontested and in any event consistent with\nEtherton\u2019s defense. SeeHarrington, 562 U.\u00a0S., at 105\n(\u201cEven underde\u00a0novoreview, the standard for judging\ncounsel\u2019s representation is a most deferential one.\u201d). A fairminded\njurist could similarly conclude, again deferring underStrickland, thatappellatecounsel was not\nincompetent in drawing the same conclusion. And to reach the final\npoint at issue before the Sixth Circuit, a fairminded\njurist\u2014applying the deference due thestate courtunder\nAEDPA\u2014could certainly conclude that the court was not objectively\nunreasonable in deciding that appellate counsel was not incompetent\nunderStrickland, when she determined that trial counsel was\nnot incompetent underStrickland.Given AEDPA, both Etherton\u2019s appellate counsel\nand the state habeas court were to be afforded the benefit of the\ndoubt.Burt,supra, at ___. Because the Sixth Circuit\nfailed on both counts, we grant the petition for certiorari and\nreverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.It is so ordered.",
