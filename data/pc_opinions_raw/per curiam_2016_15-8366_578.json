    "text": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESSHAWN PATRICK LYNCHv.ARIZONAon petition for writ of certiorari to the\nsupreme court of arizonaNo. 15\u20138366.\u2003Decided May 31, 2016Per Curiam.UnderSimmonsv.South Carolina,\n512 U.\u00a0S. 154 (1994) , and its progeny, \u201cwhere a capital\ndefendant\u2019s future dangerousness is at issue, and the only\nsentencing alternative to death available to the jury is life\nimprisonment without possibility of parole,\u201d the Due Process Clause\n\u201centitles the defendant \u2018to inform the jury of [his] parole\nineligibility, either by a jury instruction or in arguments by\ncounsel.\u2019\u00a0\u201dShaferv.South Carolina, 532\nU.\u00a0S. 36, 39 (2001) (quotingRamdassv.Angelone, 530 U.\u00a0S. 156, 165 (2000) (plurality\nopinion)). In the decision below, the Arizona Supreme Court found\nthat the State had put petitioner Shawn Patrick Lynch\u2019s future\ndangerousness at issue during his capital sentencing proceeding and\nacknowledged that Lynch\u2019s only alternative sentence to death was\nlife imprisonment without parole. 238 Ariz. 84, 103, 357 P. 3d 119,\n138 (2015). But the court nonetheless concluded that Lynch had no\nright to inform the jury of his parole ineligibility.Ibid.The judgment is reversed.A jury convicted Lynch of first-degree murder,\nkidnapping, armed robbery, and burglary for the 2001 killing of\nJames Panzarella. The State sought the death penalty. Before\nLynch\u2019s penalty phase trial began, Arizona moved to prevent his\ncounsel from informing the jury that the only alternative sentence\nto death was life without the possibility of parole. App. K to Pet.\nfor Cert. The court granted the motion.Lynch\u2019s first penalty phase jury failed to reach\na unanimous verdict. A second jury was convened and sentenced Lynch\nto death. On appeal, the Arizona Supreme Court vacated the sentence\nbecause the jury instructions improperly described Arizona law. The\ncourt did not address Lynch\u2019s alternative argument that the trial\ncourt had violatedSimmons. On remand, a third penalty phase\njury sentenced Lynch to death.The Arizona Supreme Court affirmed, this time\nconsidering and rejecting Lynch\u2019sSimmonsclaim. The court\nagreed that, during the third penalty phase, \u201c[t]he State suggested\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. that Lynch could be dangerous.\u201d 238 Ariz., at 103,\n357 P. 3d, at 138. The court also recognized that Lynch was parole\nineligible: Under Arizona law, \u201cparole is available only to\nindividuals who committed a felony before January 1, 1994,\u201d and\nLynch committed his crimes in 2001.Ibid.(citing Ariz. Rev.\nStat. Ann. \u00a741\u20131604.09(I)). Nevertheless, while \u201c[a]n instruction\nthat parole is not currently available would be correct,\u201d the court\nheld that \u201cthe failure to give theSimmonsinstruction was\nnot error.\u201d 238 Ariz., at 103, 357 P. 3d, at 138.That conclusion conflicts with this Court\u2019s\nprecedents. InSimmons, as here, a capital defendant was\nineligible for parole under state law. 512 U.\u00a0S., at 156\n(plurality opinion). During the penalty phase, the State argued\nthat the jurors should consider the defendant\u2019s future\ndangerousness when determining the proper punishment.Id.,\nat 157. But the trial court refused to permit defense counsel to\ntell the jury that the only alternative sentence to death was life\nwithout parole.Id.,at 157, 160. The Court reversed,\nreasoning that due process entitled the defendant to rebut the\nprosecution\u2019s argument that he posed a future danger by informing\nhis sentencing jury that he is parole ineligible.Id., at\n161\u2013162;id., at 178 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring in judgment).\nThe Court\u2019s opinions reiterated that holding inRamdass,Shafer, andKellyv.South Carolina, 534\nU.\u00a0S. 246 (2002) .The Arizona Supreme Court thought Arizona\u2019s\nsentencing law sufficiently different from the others this Court\nhad considered thatSimmonsdid not apply. It relied on the\nfact that, under state law, Lynch could have received a life\nsentence that would have made him eligible for \u201crelease\u201d after 25\nyears. 238 Ariz., at 103\u2013104, 357 P. 3d, at 138\u2013139; \u00a713\u2013751(A).\nBut under state law, the only kind of release for which Lynch would\nhave been eligible\u2014as the State does not contest\u2014is executive\nclemency. See Pet. for Cert. 22; 238 Ariz., at 103\u2013104, 357 P. 3d,\nat 138\u2013139. AndSimmonsexpressly rejected the argument that\nthe possibility of clemency diminishes a capital defendant\u2019s right\nto inform a jury of his parole ineligibility. There, South Carolina\nhad argued that the defendant need not be allowed to present this\ninformation to the jury \u201cbecause future exigencies,\u201d including\n\u201ccommutation [and] clemency,\u201d could one day \u201callow [him] to be\nreleased into society.\u201d 512 U.\u00a0S., at 166 (plurality opinion).\nThe Court disagreed: \u201cTo the extent that the State opposes even a\nsimple parole-ineligibility instruction because of hypothetical\nfuture developments, the argument has little force.\u201dIbid.;id.,at 177 (opinion of O\u2019Connor, J.) (explaining that the\ndefendant had a right \u201cto bring his parole ineligibility to the\njury\u2019s attention\u201d and that the State could respond with \u201ctruthful\ninformation regarding the availability of commutation, pardon, and\nthe like\u201d).The State responds thatSimmons\u201c\u00a0\u2018applies only to instances where, as a legal matter, there\nisno possibilityof parole.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Brief in Opposition 11\n(quotingRamdass, 530 U.\u00a0S., at 169 (plurality\nopinion)). Notwithstanding the fact that Arizona law currently\nprevents all felons who committed their offenses after 1993 from\nobtaining parole, 238 Ariz., at 103, 357 P. 3d, at 138, Arizona\nreasons that \u201cnothing prevents the legislature from creating a\nparole system in the future for which [Lynch] would have been\neligible had the court sentenced him to life with the possibility\nof release after 25 years.\u201d Brief in Opposition 12.This Court\u2019s precedents also foreclose that\nargument.Simmonssaid that the potential for future\n\u201clegislative reform\u201d could not justify refusing a\nparole-ineligibility instruction. 512 U.\u00a0S., at 166 (plurality\nopinion). If it were otherwise, a State could always argue that its\nlegislature might pass a law rendering the defendant parole\neligible. Accordingly, as this Court later explained, \u201cthe\ndispositive fact inSimmonswas that the defendant\nconclusively established his parole ineligibility under state law\nat the time of his trial.\u201dRamdass,supra, at 171\n(plurality opinion). In this case, the Arizona Supreme Court\nconfirmed that parole was unavailable to Lynch under its law.Simmonsand its progeny establish Lynch\u2019s right to inform\nhis jury of that fact.The petition for writ of certiorari and the\nmotion for leave to proceedin forma pauperisare granted.\nThe judgment of the Arizona Supreme Court is reversed, and the case\nis remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this\nopinion.It is so ordered.",
