    "text": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESDAVID SHINN, DIRECTOR, ARIZONA DEPARTMENT OF\nCORRECTIONSv.GEORGE RUSSELL KAYERon petition for writ of certiorari to the\nunited states court of appeals for the ninth circuitNo. 19\u20131302.\u2003Decided December 14, 2020Per Curiam.The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty\nAct of 1996 (AEDPA) restricts the power of federal courts to grant\nwrits of habeas corpus based on claims that were \u201cadjudicated on\nthe merits\u201d by a state court. 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72254(d). When\na state court has applied clearly established federal law to\nreasonably determined facts in the process of adjudicating a claim\non the merits,a federal habeas court may not disturb the\nstate court\u2019s decision unless its error lies \u201cbeyond any\npossibility for fairminded disagreement.\u201dHarringtonv.Richter,562 U.S.\n86, 103 (2011). In this case, the Court of Appeals erred in\nordering issuance of a writ of habeas corpus despite ample room for\nreasonable disagreement about the prisoner\u2019s\nineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim. In so doing, the Court of\nAppeals clearly violated this Court\u2019s AEDPA jurisprudence. We\ntherefore grant the petition for certiorari and vacate the judgment\nbelow.IARespondent George Kayer murdered Delbert Haas\nin 1994. Haas, Kayer, and Lisa Kester were on a trip to gamble in\nLaughlin, Nevada. While there, Kayer borrowed money from Haas and\nlost it gambling. Kayer then devised a plan to rob Haas, but Kester\nquestioned whether he could get away with robbing someone he knew.\nKayer responded, \u201c\u00a0\u2018I guess I\u2019ll just have to kill\nhim.\u2019\u00a0\u201dStatev.Kayer, 194 Ariz. 423, 428, 984\nP.2d 31, 36 (1999). While the three drove home, Kayer took a detour\nto a secluded area and stopped on the side of a dirt road. After\nHaas exited the vehicle to urinate, Kayer grabbed a gun, sneaked up\nto him, and shot him pointblank in the head. After dragging Haas\u2019\nbody into some bushes, Kayer stole his wallet, watch, and jewelry,\nand drove away. Kayer soon realized that he had forgotten to take\nHaas\u2019 house keys, and he therefore returned to the scene of the\ncrime. Fearing that Haas might not be dead, Kayer shot him in the\nhead again while retrieving his keys. Subsequently, Kayer stole a\nvariety of firearms and other things of value from Haas\u2019 home after\ninstructing Kester to use a police scanner to look out for police\nactivity. The two sold many of the stolen items under aliases, but\nKayer was arrested after Kester went to the police. After a jury\ntrial before Judge William T. Kiger, Kayer was found guilty of\npremeditated first-degree murder and related offenses.After being found guilty, Kayer \u201cmade clear his\ndesire to expedite the sentencing process.\u201dId., at 429, 984\nP.\u00a02d, at 37. He refused to fully cooperate with a mitigation\nspecialist. When Kayer\u2019s counsel stated that the specialist needed\nmore time to evaluate Kayer\u2019s case, Kayer refused to agree to a\ncontinuance, and the trial court ruled him competent to make that\nchoice. At sentencing, the judge again asked Kayer whether he would\nlike more time for investigation, but Kayer \u201crefused the offer and\nstated he would not cooperate with [the specialist] no matter how\nlong sentencing was delayed.\u201dId.,at 429\u2013430, 984\nP.\u00a02d, at 37\u201338.The court proceeded to sentencing. At that time,\nArizona law required a judge, not a jury, to determine whether\ncertain aggravating circumstances had been established, and a judge\nwas authorized to impose a sentence of death only if at least one\nsuch aggravating circumstance was shown and there was no mitigating\ncircumstance that was sufficient to call for leniency. See Ariz.\nRev. Stat. Ann. \u00a713\u2013703 (Supp. 1998); cf.Ringv.Arizona,536 U.S.\n584, 609 (2002) (subsequently requiring juries \u201cto find an\naggravating circumstance necessary for imposition of the death\npenalty\u201d). In Kayer\u2019s case, the judge found that the State had\nproved two aggravating factors beyond a reasonable doubt. First,\nthe court concluded that Kayer had been \u201cpreviously convicted of a\nserious offense,\u201d \u00a713\u2013703(F)(2), based on his conviction for\nfirst-degree burglary in 1981, see \u00a713\u2013703(H)(9);Kayer, 194\nAriz., at 433, 984 P.\u00a02d, at 41. Second, it determined that\nKayer murdered Haas for \u201cpecuniary gain,\u201d see \u00a713\u2013703(F)(5). On the\nother side of the balance, the court found that Kayer had\ndemonstrated only one nonstatutory mitigator: his importance in his\nson\u2019s life. Weighing the aggravating and mitigating factors, Judge\nKiger sentenced Kayer to death, and the Arizona Supreme Court\naffirmed his conviction and sentence.BKayer subsequently filed a petition for\npostconviction relief in Arizona Superior Court. Among his many\nclaims, Kayer argued that he received ineffective assistance of\ncounsel because his attorneys failed to investigate mitigating\ncircumstances at the outset of the criminal proceedings. The\nsentencing judge held a 9-day evidentiary hearing.Kayer\u2019s evidence at the hearing broke down into\nfour main categories: evidence that he was addicted to alcohol and\ngambling; evidence that he had suffered a heart attack about six\nweeks before the murder; evidence of mental illness, including a\ndiagnosis of bipolar disorder; and evidence that members of his\nfamily had suffered from similar addictions and illnesses in the\npast and that this had affected his childhood. SeeKayerv.Ryan, 923 F.3d 692, 708\u2013713 (CA9 2019) (describing evidence\nin detail).The court denied relief after applying the\nfamiliar two-part test fromStricklandv.Washington,466 U.S.\n668(1984). The court found that trial counsel\u2019s performance\nwas not deficient because Kayer had refused to cooperate with his\nmitigation team\u2019s efforts to gather more mitigation evidence. And,\nin the alternative, the court held that \u201cifthere had been a\nfinding that the performance prong of theStricklandstandard had been met, .\u00a0.\u00a0. no prejudice to the\ndefendant can be found.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 189. The court\nadded that \u201c[i]n stating this conclusion[, it] ha[d] considered the\nassertion of mental illness, physical illness, jail conditions,\nchildhood development, and any alcohol or gambling addictions.\u201dIbid. The Arizona Supreme Court denied Kayer\u2019s petition to\nreview the denial of postconviction relief.Statev.Kayer, No. CR\u201307\u20130163\u2013PC (Nov. 7, 2007).CKayer then filed an unsuccessful habeas\npetition in Federal District Court. See 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a72254. Relevant here, the District Court rejected Kayer\u2019s\nineffective-assistance claim for failure to show prejudice. As an\ninitial matter, the court concluded that Kayer could not \u201cshow\nprejudice because he waived an extension of the sentencing date and\nthereby waived presentation of the full-scale mitigation case.\u201dKayerv.Ryan, 2009 WL 3352188, *21 (D Ariz., Oct.\n19, 2009) (citingSchrirov.Landrigan,550 U.S.\n465(2007)). Moreover, the court reasoned that Kayer\u2019s\nmitigation evidence \u201cfell short of the type of mitigation\ninformation that would have influenced the sentencing decision.\u201d\n2009 WL 3352188, *21.A divided Ninth Circuit panel reversed. On the\nquestion of trial counsel\u2019s performance, the panel rejected the\nstate court\u2019s judgment because, in the judgment of the panel,\nKayer\u2019s attorneys should have begun to pursue mitigation evidence\npromptly after their appointment. And on the question of prejudice,\nthe court conducted its own review of the evidence and found that\ntrial counsel\u2019s alleged failings likely affected Kayer\u2019s sentence.\nBased on a \u201ccomparison of Kayer\u2019s case with other Arizona cases,\u201d\nthe panel drew two conclusions: first, that \u201cthe evidence he\npresented to the [state postconviction] court was sufficient to\nestablish a statutory mitigating circumstance\u201d of mental\nimpairment, 923 F.\u00a03d, at 718, and second, that there was a\nreasonable probability that the Arizona Supreme Court would have\nvacated Kayer\u2019s death sentence on direct review had it been\npresented with the mitigating evidence offered at the state\npostconviction relief hearing. For these reasons, the panel\nmajority found that \u201cthere is a reasonable probability Kayer\u2019s\nsentence would have been less than death, and that the state\n[postconviction] court was unreasonable in concluding otherwise.\u201dId.,at 723.Judge Owens dissented in relevant part,\nexplaining that the Arizona postconviction court had not\nunreasonably applied federal law in light of the aggravating and\nmitigating circumstances in this case. In his view, Kayer\u2019s\nmitigating evidence was \u201chardly overwhelming,\u201d and he argued that\nthe majority had given short shrift to the \u201cundisputedly strong\naggravating factor\u201d of pecuniary gain.Id., at 727. The\nmajority\u2019s holding, he concluded, resulted from \u201cimpermissibly\nsubstitut[ing] its own judgment that Kayer was prejudiced\u201d for that\nof the state court.Ibid.Arizona then sought, and the Ninth Circuit\ndenied, rehearing en banc. Judge Bea authored a dissent from the\ndenial of en banc review, which was joined by 11 other judges. SeeKayerv.Ryan, 944 F.3d 1147, 1156 (2019). Judge Bea\nasserted that \u201cthe panel majority cast aside .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nAEDPA\u2019s highly deferential standard of review.\u201dId.,at\n1158. Instead, he wrote, the panel majority had applied a\n\u201cde-novo-masquerading-as-deference approach\u201d that the \u201cSupreme\nCourt has repeatedly condemned.\u201dId.,at 1168; see alsoid.,at 1157, n.\u00a01 (citing 14 cases since 2002 in which\nthis Court has reversed the Ninth Circuit\u2019s application of AEDPA).\nUnder AEDPA and this Court\u2019s precedent, he contended, \u201cthere [was]\nno ignoring the obvious conclusion that a reasonable jurist could\nconclude that Kayer was not in fact prejudiced by his counsel\u2019s\nfailings in this case.\u201dId.,at 1164. The mitigating impact\nof Kayer\u2019s new evidence was, at best, \u201chighly debatable.\u201dId.,at 1169 (internal quotation marks omitted). Applying\nthe proper standard of review, Judge Bea explained that \u201cit [was]\npossible that fairminded jurists could find [Kayer\u2019s] evidenceinsufficientto establish a reasonable probability of a\ndifferent outcome.\u201dId.,at 1168 (citingRichter, 562\nU.\u00a0S., at 102).After the denial of rehearing en banc, Arizona\nfiled a petition for certiorari in this Court.IIAKayer asserts that his death sentence was\nimposed in violation of his Sixth Amendment right to effective\nassistance of counsel. As the state court recognized, this Court\u2019s\ndecision inStricklandv.Washington,466 U.S.\n668(1984), provides the proper framework for assessing that\nclaim. UnderStrickland, Kayer must show that his counsel\nprovided \u201cdeficient\u201d performance that \u201cprejudiced the defense.\u201dId.,at 687. In the capital sentencing context, the\nprejudice inquiry asks \u201cwhether there is a reasonable probability\nthat, absent the errors, the sentencer\u2014including an appellate\ncourt, to the extent it independently reweighs the evidence\u2014would\nhave concluded that the balance of aggravating and mitigating\ncircumstances did not warrant death.\u201dId.,at 695. TheStricklandstandard is \u201chighly demanding.\u201dKimmelmanv.Morrison,477 U.S.\n365, 382 (1986). A reasonable probability means a\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018substantial,\u2019 not just \u2018conceivable,\u2019 likelihood of a\ndifferent result.\u201dCullenv.Pinholster,563 U.S.\n170, 189 (2011) (quotingRichter, 562 U.\u00a0S., at\n112).When an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim\nis presented in a federal habeas petition, a state prisoner faces\nadditional burdens. Among other things, no relief may be granted\n\u201cwith respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in\nState court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim,\u201d as\nrelevant here, \u201cresulted in a decision that was contrary to, or\ninvolved an unreasonable application of, clearly established\nFederal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United\nStates.\u201d 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72254(d).Here, the state court applied \u201cthe correct\ngoverning legal principle .\u00a0.\u00a0. to the facts of the\nprisoner\u2019s case,\u201dLockyerv.Andrade,538 U.S.\n63, 75 (2003) (internal quotation marks omitted), so the\nquestion is whether its decision involved an \u201cunreasonable\napplication of\u00a0\u201d this Court\u2019s precedent. To meet that\nstandard, a prisoner must show far more than that the state court\u2019s\ndecision was \u201cmerely wrong\u201d or \u201ceven clear error.\u201dVirginiav.LeBlanc, 582 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2017) (per\ncuriam) (slip op., at 3) (internal quotation marks omitted).\nThe prisoner must show that the state court\u2019s decision is so\nobviously wrong that its error lies \u201cbeyond any possibility for\nfairminded disagreement.\u201dRichter, 562 U.\u00a0S., at 103.\nCongress \u201cmeant\u201d this standard to be \u201cdifficult to meet.\u201dId.,at 102.We have recognized the special importance of the\nAEDPA framework in cases involvingStricklandclaims.\nIneffective -assistance claims can function \u201cas a way to escape\nrules of waiver and forfeiture,\u201dRichter, 562 U.\u00a0S., at\n105, and they can drag federal courts into resolving questions of\nstate law. Moreover, we have recognized that \u201cthe more general the\nrule, the more leeway state courts have.\u201dSextonv.Beaudreaux, 585 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2018) (per\ncuriam) (slip op., at 8) (quotingRenicov.Lett,559 U.S.\n766, 776 (2010); quotation modified). \u201c[B]ecause theStricklandstandard is a general standard, a state court has\neven more latitude to reasonably determine that a defendant has not\nsatisfied that standard.\u201dKnowlesv.Mirzayance,556 U.S.\n111, 123 (2009).BThe Ninth Circuit resolved this case in a\nmanner fundamentally inconsistent with AEDPA. Most striking, the\npanel \u201cessentially evaluated the meritsde novo, only\ntacking on a perfunctory statement at the end of its analysis\nasserting that the state court\u2019s decision was unreasonable.\u201dBeaudreaux, 585 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 7); seeRichter, 562 U.\u00a0S., at 101\u2013102. In other words, it\nappears \u201cto have treated the unreasonableness question as a test of\nits confidence in the result it would reach underde novoreview.\u201dId., at 102. More specifically, the panel concludedde novothat \u201cthere is a reasonable probability Kayer\u2019s\nsentence would have been less than death,\u201d and then simply appended\nthe statement that \u201cthe state [postconviction review] court was\nunreasonable in concluding otherwise.\u201d 923 F.\u00a03d, at 723.\nIndeed, the panel repeatedly reached conclusions\u2014such as that the\n\u201cevidence presented to the [postconviction] court established the\nstatutory mitigating circumstance of mental impairment,\u201did.,at 719, and that there was a \u201ccausal connection between\nKayer\u2019s mental impairment and the crime,\u201dibid.\u2014without ever\nframing the relevant question as whether a fairminded jurist could\nreach a different conclusion.Applying the proper standard of review, we\nvacate the Court of Appeals\u2019 judgment. Judge Kiger found that Kayer\nhad failed to show deficient performance and, assuming deficient\nperformance, that he failed to show prejudice.[1] Federal courts may not disturb the judgments of\nstate courts unless \u201ceachground supporting the state court\ndecision is examined and found to be unreasonable.\u201dWetzelv.Lambert,565 U.S.\n520, 525 (2012) (per curiam). Thus, if a fairminded\njurist could agree with either Judge Kiger\u2019s deficiency or\nprejudice holding, the reasonableness of the other is \u201cbeside the\npoint.\u201dId.,at 524; seeParkerv.Matthews,567 U.S.\n37, 42 (2012) (per curiam) (\u201c[I]t is irrelevant\n[whether] the court also invoked a ground of questionable\nvalidity\u201d);Richter, 562 U.\u00a0S., at 102.We focus on the state court\u2019s prejudice\ndetermination. Insofar as the state court offered its conclusion on\nthe prejudice question without articulating its reasoning\nsupporting that conclusion, we \u201cmust determine what arguments or\ntheories .\u00a0.\u00a0. could have supported the state court\u2019s\u201d\ndetermination that Kayer failed to show prejudice.Id., at\n102. Then we must assess whether \u201c\u00a0\u2018fairminded jurists could\ndisagree\u2019 on the correctness of the state court\u2019s decision\u201d if\nbased on one of those arguments or theories.Id.,at 101\n(quotingYarboroughv.Alvarado,541 U.S.\n652, 664 (2004)); seePinholster, 563 U.\u00a0S., at\n188.Perhaps the most probable reason for Judge\nKiger\u2019s no-prejudice determination is simply that the new\nmitigation evidence offered in the postconviction proceeding did\nnot create a substantial likelihood of a different sentencing\noutcome. The Ninth Circuit generally considered that possibility,\nbut in so doing impermissibly \u201csubstituted its own judgment for\nthat of the state court\u201d instead of applying deferential review.Woodfordv.Visciotti,537 U.S.\n19, 25 (2002) (per curiam).[2] It characterized Kayer\u2019s prior-offense aggravator\n(first-degree burglary) as \u201crelatively weak\u201d in comparison with\nother offenses that qualified under the Arizona capital sentencing\nlaw. 923 F.\u00a03d, at 718. And on the other side of the balance,\nit attributed considerable weight to evidence that it viewed as\nshowing that Kayer\u2019s \u201ccapacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of\nhis conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law\nwas significantly impaired.\u201d Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann.\n\u00a713\u2013703(G)(1).Perhaps some jurists would share those views,\nbut that is not the relevant standard. The question is whether a\nfairminded jurist could take a different view. SeeVisciotti, 537 U.\u00a0S., at 24\u201327; see alsoPinholster, 563 U.\u00a0S., at 200\u2013202. And the answer is\nyes. For one thing, a fairminded jurist might differently evaluate\nthe effect of Kayer\u2019s prior-offense aggravator (let alone the\npecuniary gain aggravator). Arizona first-degree burglary required\nas an element that he or an accomplice was \u201carmed with explosives,\na deadly weapon or a dangerous instrument.\u201d Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann.\n\u00a713\u20131508(A) (1978). And Judge Kiger determined that Kayer \u201cwas\narmed with a .41 caliber handgun\u201d during his prior offense.\nExcerpts of Record in No. 09\u201399027 (CA9), p. 935. A fairminded\njurist could see Kayer\u2019s past conviction as having substantial\nweight in the context of this murder by shooting.Fairminded jurists also could take a different\nview of Kayer\u2019s mitigating evidence. Kayer offered evidence that he\nsuffered from bipolar disorder and untreated drinking and gambling\naddictions at the time of the crime, but reasonable jurists could\ndebate the extent to which these factors significantly impaired his\nability to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform\nhis conduct to the law at the time of the murder. For example, the\nrecord reveals that Kayer had extensive opportunities to consider\nhis actions\u2014planning the murder in advance, driving his victim to a\nremote area, and subsequently returning to the murder scene and\nshooting the victim in the head a second time. Moreover, Kayer\u2019s\nplanning of the murder, efforts to hide the body, interactions with\nKester before and after the murder, and attempts to profit from his\ncrimes using an alias display a measure of control and\nintentionality. On this record, a fairminded jurist reasonably\ncould conclude that Kayer\u2019s evidence of mental impairment, in the\nwords of Judge Owens, was \u201chardly overwhelming.\u201d 923 F.\u00a03d, at\n727; see also 944 F.\u00a03d, at 1168\u20131171 (Bea, J., dissenting\nfrom denial of rehearing en banc).Kayer counters that his claim is unusually\nstrong because the Arizona Supreme Court would have \u201cindependently\nreweigh[ed] the evidence\u201d on direct appeal.Strickland, 466\nU.\u00a0S., at 695. In his view, the similarity between his\npostconviction case and judgments that the State Supreme Court has\nissued in other cases on direct review supports hisStricklandclaim. Arizona responds that the State Supreme\nCourt would not have reweighed the evidence in the manner\ncontemplated byStrickland. And it asks this Court to hold\nthat past state judgments on direct review are categorically\nirrelevant to AEDPA review.We need not address these broad questions in\norder to resolve this case. Even if Arizona\u2019s sentencing practices\ninvolved reweighing evidence on direct appeal, capital sentencing\nrequires \u201canindividualizeddetermination on the basis of\nthe character of the individual and the circumstances of the\ncrime.\u201dZantv.Stephens,462\nU.S. 862, 879 (1983). For present purposes, it suffices to say\nthat, because the facts in each capital sentencing case are unique,\nthe weighing of aggravating and mitigating evidence in a prior\npublished decision is unlikely to provide clear guidance about how\na state court would weigh the evidence in a later case.Kayer, like the panel below, focuses his\nargument on the Arizona Supreme Court\u2019s decision inStatev.Brookover, 124 Ariz. 38,601 P.2d 1322(1979), but that decision falls far short of\nplacing the state court\u2019s prejudice determination in this case\nbeyond the realm of fairminded disagreement. InBrookover,there was only one aggravating circumstance (a prior conviction for\na serious offense), whereas Kayer\u2019s sentencing involved two\nstatutory aggravators.[3] And\nas for the mitigating evidence inBrookover, while it is far\nfrom clear exactly what mitigating evidence influenced the court\u2019s\nindividualized sentencing determination, the opinion refers to\nevidence that appears significantly different from that in this\ncase. TheBrookoveropinion refers to evidence of a\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018neurological lesion\u2019\u00a0\u201d of a type that caused \u201c\u00a0\u2018a\nrelinquishment of one\u2019s self autonomy.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId., at 41,\n601 P.\u00a02d, at 1325. By contrast, a reasonable jurist could\nview Kayer\u2019s mitigation evidence in a different light for the\nreasons explained above. In these circumstances, theBrookoverdecision does not come close to showing the sort\nof \u201cextreme malfunctio[n] in the state criminal justice syste[m]\u201d\nthat would permit federal court intervention.Richter, 562\nU.\u00a0S., at 102 (internal quotation marks omitted).*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*Under AEDPA, state courts play the leading\nrole in assessing challenges to state sentences based on federal\nlaw. A state court heard Kayer\u2019s evidence and concluded that he\nfailed to show prejudice. The court below exceeded its authority in\nrejecting that determination, which was not so obviously wrong as\nto be \u201cbeyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.\u201dId., at 103. Under \u00a72254(d), that is \u201c\u00a0\u2018the only\nquestion that matters.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId.,at 102.We grant the petition for a writ of certiorari,\nvacate the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the\nNinth Circuit, and remand the case to that court for further\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.Justice Breyer, Justice Sotomayor, and Justice\nKagan dissent.Notes1Section 2254 calls for\nreview of the \u201clast state-court adjudication on the merits.\u201dGreenev.Fisher,565 U.S.\n34, 40 (2011). The Ninth Circuit treated the Superior Court\u2019s\ndecision, rather than the Arizona Supreme Court\u2019s denial of review,\nas the last state-court adjudication on the merits. Unreasoned\ndispositions by appellate courts sometimes qualify as adjudications\non the merits. In those cases, we apply a rebuttable presumption\nthat the appellate court\u2019s decision rested on the same grounds as\nthe reasoned decision of a lower court. SeeWilsonv.Sellers, 584 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2018). We may assume without\ndeciding that the Arizona Supreme Court\u2019s denial of discretionary\nreview was not a merits adjudication because we conclude that the\nSuperior Court did not unreasonably apply federal law. In these\ncircumstances, there would be no need to consider whether an\nunreasoned decision of a higher court may have rested on different\ngrounds than the decision of a lower court.2In its efforts to\ndistinguishWoodfordv.Visciotti,537 U.S.\n19, the panel found it \u201ccritically important\u201d thatVisciottiinvolved postconviction review by a State Supreme\nCourt. The panel emphasized that here, by contrast, it did not\n\u201cknow how the Arizona Supreme Court would have assessed [the new]\nevidence on collateral review because the Court denied without\nexplanation Kayer\u2019s petition for review.\u201dKayerv.Ryan, 923 F.3d 692, 724 (2019). But the lower court and the\nparties have not identified anything in AEDPA or this Court\u2019s\nprecedents permitting reduced deference to merits decisions of\nlower state courts. See 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72254.3The Ninth Circuit brushed\npast this distinction, reasoning that the Arizona Supreme Courtcouldhave found a pecuniary gain aggravating factor based\non the facts ofBrookover. But that does not change the fact\nthat theBrookovercourt did not weigh any second\naggravating factor in reaching its decision. See 124 Ariz., at\n41\u201342, 601 P.\u00a02d, at 1325\u20131326.",
