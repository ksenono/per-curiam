    "text": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESSHAUN MICHAEL BOSSEv.OKLAHOMAon petition for writ of certiorari to the\ncourt of criminal appeals of oklahomaNo. 15\u20139173.\u2003Decided October 11, 2016Per Curiam.InBoothv.Maryland, 482\nU.\u00a0S. 496 (1987) , this Court held that \u201cthe Eighth Amendment\nprohibits a capital sentencing jury from considering victim impact\nevidence\u201d that does not \u201crelate directly to the circumstances of\nthe crime.\u201dId., at 501\u2013502, 507, n. 10. Four years later,\ninPaynev.Tennessee, 501 U.\u00a0S. 808 (1991) ,\nthe Courtgranted certiorari to reconsider that ban on\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018victim impact\u2019evidence relating to the personal\ncharacteristics of the victim and the emotional impact of the\ncrimes on the victim\u2019s family.\u201dId., at 817. The Court held\nthatBoothwas wrong to conclude that the Eighth Amendment\nrequired such a ban.Payne, 501 U.\u00a0S. at 827. That\nholding was expressly \u201climited to\u201d this particular type of victim\nimpact testimony.Id., at 830, n. 2. \u201cBoothalso held\nthat the admission of a victim\u2019s family members\u2019 characterizations\nand opinions about the crime, the defendant, and the appropriate\nsentence violates the Eighth Amendment,\u201d but no such evidence was\npresented inPayne, so the Court had no occasion to\nreconsider that aspect of the decision.Ibid.The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals has held\nthatPayne\u201cimplicitlyoverruled that portion ofBoothregarding characterizations of the defendant and\nopinions of the sentence.\u201dConoverv.State, 933 P.\n2d 904, 920 (1997) (emphasis added); see alsoLedbetterv.State, 933 P. 2d 880, 890\u2013891 (Okla. Crim. App. 1997). The\ndecision below presents a straightforward application of that\ninterpretation ofPayne. A jury convicted petitioner Shaun\nMichael Bosse of three counts of first-degree murder for the 2010\nkilling of Katrina Griffin and her two children. The State of\nOklahoma sought the death penalty. Over Bosse\u2019s objection, the\nState asked three of the victims\u2019 relatives to recommend a sentence\nto the jury. All three recommended death, and the jury agreed.\nBosse appealed, arguing that this testimony about the appropriate\nsentence violated the Eighth Amendment underBooth. The\nOklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed his sentence,\nconcluding that there was \u201cno error.\u201d 2015 OK CR 14, \u00b6\u00b6 57\u201358, 360\nP. 3d 1203, 1226\u20131227. We grant certiorari and the motion for leave\nto proceedin forma pauperis, and now vacate the judgment of\nthe Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals.\u201c[I]t is this Court\u2019s prerogative alone to\noverrule one of its precedents.\u201dUnited Statesv.Hatter, 532 U.\u00a0S. 557, 567 (2001) (quotingState Oil\nCo.v.Khan, 522 U.\u00a0S. 3, 20 (1997) ; internal\nquotation marks omitted); seeRodriguez de Quijasv.Shearson/American Express, Inc., 490 U.\u00a0S. 477, 484\n(1989) . The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals has recognized thatPayne\u201cspecifically acknowledged its holding did not affect\u201dBooth\u2019s prohibition on opinions about the crime, the\ndefendant, and the appropriate punishment.Ledbetter, 933 P.\n2d at 890\u2013891. That should have ended its inquiry into whether the\nEighth Amendment bars such testimony; the court was wrong to go\nfurther and conclude thatPayneimplicitly overruledBoothin its entirety. \u201cOur decisions remain binding\nprecedent until we see fit to reconsider them, regardless of\nwhether subsequent cases have raised doubts about their continuing\nvitality.\u201dHohnv.United States, 524 U.\u00a0S. 236\n\u2013253 (1998).The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals remains\nbound byBooth\u2019s prohibition on characterizations and\nopinions from a victim\u2019s family members about the crime, the\ndefendant, and the appropriate sentence unless this Court\nreconsiders that ban. The state court erred in concluding\notherwise.The State argued in opposing certiorari that,\neven if the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals was wrong in its\nvictim impact ruling, that error did not affect the jury\u2019s\nsentencing determination, and the defendant\u2019s rights were in any\nevent protected by the mandatory sentencing review in capital cases\nrequired under Oklahoma law. See Brief in Opposition 14\u201315. Those\ncontentions may be addressed on remand to the extent the court\nbelow deems appropriate.The judgment of the Oklahoma Court of Criminal\nAppeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for further\nproceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.",
