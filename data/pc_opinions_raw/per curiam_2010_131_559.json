OBAMA,\nPRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES et\u00a0al.on writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the district of columbia circuitNo. 08\u20131234.\u2003Decided March 1, 2010Per Curiam.We granted certiorari, 558 U. S.\n___ (2009), on the question whether a federal court exercising\nhabeas jurisdiction has the power to order the release of prisoners\nheld at Guantanamo Bay \u201cwhere the Executive detention is indefinite\nand without authorization in law, and release into the continental\nUnited States is the only possible effective remedy,\u201d Pet. for\nCert. i. By now, however, each of the detainees at issue in this\ncase has received at least one offer of resettlement in another\ncountry. Most of the detainees have accepted an offer of\nresettlement; five detainees, however, have rejected two such\noffers and are still being held at Guantanamo Bay.This change in the underlying facts may affect\nthe legal issues presented. No court has yet ruled in this case in\nlight of the new facts, and we decline to be the first to do so.\nSee,e.g.,Cutterv.Wilkinson,544 U. S. 709, 718, n. 7\n(2005) (\u201c[W]e are a court of review, not of first view\u201d).Under these circumstances, we vacate the\njudgment and remand the case to the United States Court of Appeals\nfor the District of Columbia Circuit. It should determine, in the\nfirst instance, what further proceedings in that court or in the\nDistrict Court are necessary and appropriate for the full and\nprompt disposition of the case in light of the new\ndevelopments.It is so ordered.",
