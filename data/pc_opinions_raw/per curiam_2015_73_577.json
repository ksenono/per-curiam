    "text": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESRANDY WHITE, WARDENv.ROGER L. WHEELERon petition for writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the sixth circuitNo. 14\u20131372.\u2003Decided December 14, 2015Per Curiam.A death sentence imposed by a Kentucky trial court and affirmed\nby the Kentucky Supreme Court has been overturned, on habeas corpus\nreview, by the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. During the\njury selection process, the state trial court excused a juror after\nconcluding he could not give sufficient assurance of neutrality or\nimpartiality in considering whether the death penalty should be\nimposed. The Court of Appeals, despite the substantial deference it\nmust accord to state-court rulings in federal habeas proceedings,\ndetermined that excusing the juror in the circumstances of this\ncase violated the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments. That ruling\ncontravenes controlling precedents from this Court, and it is now\nnecessary to reverse the Court of Appeals by this summary\ndisposition.Warden Randy White is the petitioner here, and the convicted\nprisoner, Roger Wheeler, is the respondent.In October 1997, police in Louisville, Kentucky, found the\nbodies of Nigel Malone and Nairobi Warfield in the apartment the\ncouple shared. Malone had been stabbed nine times. Warfield had\nbeen strangled to death and a pair of scissors stuck out from her\nneck. She was pregnant. DNA taken from blood at the crime scene\nmatched respondent\u2019s. Respondent was charged with the murders.Duringvoir dire,Juror 638 gave equivocal and\ninconsistent answers when questioned about whether he could\nconsider voting to impose the death penalty. In response to the\njudge\u2019s questions about his personal beliefs on the death penalty,\nJuror 638 said, \u201cI\u2019m not sure that I have formed an opinion one way\nor the other. I believe there are arguments on both sides of the\u2014of\nit.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 126a. When asked by the prosecution\nabout his ability to consider all available penalties, Juror 638\nnoted he had \u201cnever been confronted with that situation in a, in a\nreal-life sense of having to make that kind of determination.\u201dId., at 131a. \u201cSo it\u2019s difficult for me,\u201d he explained, \u201cto\njudge how I would I guess act, uh.\u201dIbid.The prosecution\nsought to clarify Juror 638\u2019s answer, asking if the juror meant he\nwas \u201cnot absolutely certain whether [he] could realistically\nconsider\u201d the death penalty.Id., at 132a. Juror 638\nreplied, \u201cI think that would be the most accurate way I could\nanswer your question.\u201dIbid.During defense counsel\u2019s\nexamination, Juror 638 described himself as \u201ca bit more\ncontemplative on the issue of taking a life and, uh, whether or not\nwe have the right to take that life.\u201dId., at 133a. Later,\nhowever, he expressed his belief that he could consider all the\npenalty options.Id., at 134a.The prosecution moved to strike Juror 638 for cause based on his\ninconsistent replies, as illustrated by his statement that he was\nnot absolutely certain he could realistically consider the death\npenalty. The defense opposed the motion, arguing that Juror 638\u2019s\nanswers indicated his ability to consider all the penalty options,\ndespite having some reservations about the death penalty. The judge\nsaid that when she was done questioning Juror 638, she wrote in her\nnotes that the juror \u201c \u2018could consider [the] entire range\u2019 \u201d of\npenalties.Id., at 138a. She further stated that she did not\n\u201csee him as problematic\u201d at the end of her examination.Ibid. But she also noted that she did not \u201chear him say that\nhe couldn\u2019t realistically consider the death penalty,\u201d and reserved\nruling on the motion until she could review Juror 638\u2019s testimony.Ibid.The next day, after reviewing the relevant testimony,\nthe judge struck Juror 638 for cause. When she announced her\ndecision to excuse the juror, the trial judge stated, \u201cAnd when I\nwent back and reviewed [the juror\u2019s] entire testimony, [the\nprosecution] concluded with saying, \u2018Would it be accurate to say\nthat you couldn\u2019t, couldn\u2019t consider the entire range?\u2019 And his\nresponse is\u2014I think was, \u2018I think that would be pretty accurate.\u2019\nSo, I\u2019m going to sustain that one, too.\u201dId., at\n139a\u2013140a.The case proceeded to trial. Respondent was convicted of both\nmurders and sentenced to death. The Kentucky Supreme Court affirmed\nthe convictions and the sentence.Wheelerv.Commonwealth, 121 S. W. 3d 173, 189 (2003). In considering\nrespondent\u2019s challenges to the trial court\u2019s excusal of certain\njurors for cause, the Kentucky Supreme Court held that the trial\njudge \u201cappropriately struck for cause those jurors that could not\nimpose the death pen-alty. . . . There was no error and the rights\nof the defendant to a fair trial by a fair and impartial jury . . .\nunder both the federal and state constitutions were not violated.\u201dId.,at 179.After exhausting available state postconviction procedures,\nrespondent sought a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254\nfrom the United States District Court for the Western District of\nKentucky. He asserted,inter alia, that the Kentucky trial\ncourt erred in striking Juror 638 duringvoir direon the\nground that the juror could not give assurances that he could\nconsider the death penalty as a sentencing option. The District\nCourt dismissed the petition; but a divided panel of the Court of\nAppeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed, granting habeas relief as\nto respondent\u2019s sentence.Wheelerv.Simpson, 779 F.\n3d 366, 379 (2015). While acknowledging the deferential standard\nrequired on federal habeas review of a state conviction, the Court\nof Appeals held that allowing the exclusion of Juror 638 was an\nunreasonable application ofWitherspoonv.Illinois,\n391 U. S. 510 (1968) ,Wainwrightv.Witt, 469 U. S.\n412 (1985) , and their progeny. 779 F. 3d, at 372\u2013374.Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996\n(AEDPA), habeas relief is authorized if the state court\u2019s decision\n\u201cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of,\nclearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court\nof the United States.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(d)(1). This Court, time\nand again, has instructed that AEDPA, by setting forth necessary\npredicates before state-court judgments may be set aside, \u201cerects a\nformidable barrier to federal habeas relief for prisoners whose\nclaims have been adjudicated in state court.\u201dBurtv.Titlow, 571 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 6). Under\n\u00a72254(d)(1), \u201c \u2018a state prisoner must show that the state court\u2019s\nruling on the claim being presented in federal court was so lacking\nin justification that there was an error well understood and\ncomprehended in existing law beyond any possibility for fairminded\ndisagreement.\u2019 \u201dWhitev.Woodall, 572 U. S. ___, ___\n(2014) (slip op., at 4) (quotingHarringtonv.Richter, 562 U. S. 86, 103 (2011) ).The Court of Appeals was required to apply this deferential\nstandard to the state court\u2019s analysis of respondent\u2019s juror\nexclusion claim. InWitherspoon, this Court set forth the\nrule for juror disqualification in capital cases.Witherspoonrecognized that the Sixth Amendment\u2019s guarantee\nof an impartial jury confers on capital defendants the right to a\njury not \u201cuncommonly willing to condemn a man to die.\u201d 391 U. S.,\nat 521. But the Court with equal clarity has acknowledged the\nState\u2019s \u201cstrong interest in having jurors who are able to apply\ncapital punishment within the framework state law prescribes.\u201dUttechtv.Brown, 551 U. S. 1, 9 (2007) . To ensure\nthe proper balance between these two interests, only \u201ca juror who\nis substantially impaired in his or her ability to impose the death\npenalty under the state-law framework can be excused for cause.\u201dIbid.As the Court explained inWitt, a juror may be\nexcused for cause \u201cwhere the trial judge is left with the definite\nimpression that a prospective juror would be unable to faithfully\nand impartially apply the law.\u201d 469 U. S., at 425\u2013426.Reviewing courts owe deference to a trial court\u2019s ruling on\nwhether to strike a particular juror \u201cregardless of whether the\ntrial court engages in explicit analysis regarding substantial\nimpairment; even the granting of a motion to excuse for cause\nconstitutes an implicit finding of bias.\u201dUttecht, 551 U.\nS., at 7.A trial court\u2019s \u201cfinding may be upheld even in the\nabsence of clear statements from the juror that he or she is\nimpaired . . . .\u201dIbid.And where, as here, the federal\ncourts review a state-court ruling under the constraints imposed by\nAEDPA, the federal court must accord an additional and\n\u201cindependent, high standard\u201d of deference.Id., at 10. As a\nresult, federal habeas reviewof aWitherspoon-Wittclaim\u2014much like federal habeas review of an\nineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim\u2014must be \u201c \u2018 \u201cdoubly\ndeferential.\u201d \u2019 \u201dBurt,supra,at ___ (slip op., at\n1) (quotingCullenv.Pinholster, 563 U. S. 170, 190\n(2011) ).The Court of Appeals held that the Kentucky Supreme Court\nunreasonably appliedWitherspoon,Witt, and their\nprogeny when it determined that removing Juror 638 for cause was\nconstitutional. 779 F. 3d, at 372\u2013374. The Court of Appeals\ndetermined Juror 638 \u201cunderstood the decisions he would face and\nengaged with them in a thoughtful, honest, and conscientious\nmanner.\u201dId.,at 373. In the Court of Appeals\u2019 estimation,\nthe trial judge concluded the juror was not qualified only by\n\u201cmisapprehending a single question and answer exchange\u201d between\nJuror 638 and the prosecution,id.,at 374\u2014the exchange in\nwhich Juror 638 stated he was not absolutely certain he could\nrealistically consider the death penalty,id., at 372.\nAccording to the Court of Appeals, Juror 638 \u201cagreedhe did not\nknowto an absolute certainty whether he could realistically\nconsider the death penalty, but the court proceeded as ifhe\nknew he could not.\u201dIbid. The Court of Appeals further\ndetermined that if the trial judge, when reviewing Juror 638\u2019s\nexamination, had \u201cproperly processed that exchange\u201d between Juror\n638 and the prosecution, Juror 638 would not have been excused.Id.,at 374.Both the analysis and the conclusion in the decision under\nreview were incorrect. While the Court of Appeals acknowledged that\ndeference was required under AEDPA, it failed to ask the critical\nquestion: Was the Kentucky Supreme Court\u2019s decision to affirm the\nexcusal of Juror 638 for cause \u201c \u2018so lacking in justification that\nthere was an error well understood and comprehended in existing law\nbeyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement\u2019 \u201d?Woodall,supra, at ___ (slip op., at 4) (quotingHarrington,supra, at 103).The Court of Appeals did not properly apply the deference it was\nrequired to accord the state-court ruling. A fairminded jurist\ncould readily conclude that the trial judge\u2019s exchange with Juror\n638 reflected a \u201cdiligent and thoughtfulvoir dire\u201d; that\nshe considered with care the juror\u2019s testimony; and that she was\nfair in the exercise of her \u201cbroad discretion\u201d in determining\nwhether the juror was qualified to serve in this capital case.Uttecht, 551 U. S., at 20. Juror 638\u2019s answers duringvoir direwere at least ambiguous as to whether he would be\nable to give appropriate consideration to imposing the death\npenalty. And as this Court made clear inUttecht, \u201cwhen\nthere is ambiguity in the prospective juror\u2019s statements,\u201d the\ntrial court is \u201c \u2018entitled to resolve it in favor of the State.\u2019 \u201dId., at 7 (quotingWitt,supra, at 434).The Court of Appeals erred in its assessment of the trial\njudge\u2019s reformulation of an important part of Juror 638\u2019s\nquestioning. 779 F. 3d, at 372. When excusing the juror the day\nafter thevoir dire, the trial judge said that the\nprosecution had asked whether the juror \u201ccouldn\u2019t con-sider the\nentire range\u201d of penalties. App. to Pet. for Cert. 139a. The\nprosecution in fact asked if the juror was \u201cnot absolutely certain\nwhether [he] could realistically con-sider\u201d the entire range of\npenalties.Id., at 132a. The juror\u2019s confirmation that he\nwas \u201cnot absolutely certain whether [he] could realistically\nconsider\u201d the death penalty,ibid., was a reasonable basis\nfor the trial judge to conclude that the juror was unable to give\nthat penalty fair consideration. The trial judge\u2019s decision to\nexcuse Juror 638 did not violate clearly established federal law by\nconcluding that Juror 638 was not qualified to serve as a member\nofthis capital jury. SeeWitt,supra, at 424\u2013426. And\nsimilarly, the Kentucky Supreme Court\u2019s ruling that therewas no\nerror is not beyond any possibility for fairminded\ndisagreement.The Court of Appeals noted that the deference toward trial\ncourts recognized inUttecht\u201cwas largely premised on the\ntrial judge\u2019s ability to \u2018observe the demeanor of\u2019 \u201d the juror. 779\nF. 3d, at 373 (quoting 551 U. S., at 17). It concluded that\ndeference to the trial court here supported habeas relief, because\nthe trial judge\u2019s \u201cinitial assessment of [the juror\u2019s] answers and\ndemeanor\u201d did not lead her to immediately strike Juror 638 for\ncause. 779 F. 3d, at 373\u2013374.The Court of Appeals\u2019 conclusion conflicts with the meaning and\nholding ofUttechtand with a common-sense understanding of\nthe jury selection process. Nothing inUttechtlimits the\ntrial court to evaluating demeanor alone and not the substance of a\njuror\u2019s response. And the implicit suggestion that a trial judge is\nentitled to less deference for having deliberated after her initial\nruling is wrong. In the ordinary case the conclusion should be\nquite the opposite. It is true that a trial court\u2019s contemporaneous\nassessment of a juror\u2019s demeanor, and its bearing on how to\ninterpret or understand the juror\u2019s responses, are entitled to\nsubstantial deference; but a trial court ruling is likewise\nentitled to deference when made after a careful review of a formal\ntranscript or recording. If the trial judge chooses to reflect and\ndeliberate further, as this trial judge did after the proceedings\nrecessed for the day, that is not to be faulted; it is to be\ncommended.This is not a case where \u201cthe record discloses no basis for a\nfinding of substantial impairment.\u201dUttecht,supra,\nat 20.The two federal judges in the majority below might\nhave reached a different conclusion had they been presiding over\nthisvoir dire. But simple disagreement does not overcome\nthe two layers of deference owed by a federal habeas court in this\ncontext.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*The Kentucky Supreme Court was not unreasonable in its\napplication of clearly established federal law when it concluded\nthat the exclusion of Juror 638 did not violate the Sixth\nAmendment. Given this conclusion, there is no need to consider\npetitioner\u2019s further contention that, if there were an error by the\ntrial court in excluding the juror, it should be subject to\nharmless-error analysis. And this Court does not review the other\nrulings of the Court of Appeals that are not addressed in this\nopinion.As a final matter, this Court again advises the Court of Appeals\nthat the provisions of AEDPA apply with full force even when\nreviewing a conviction and sentence imposing the death penalty.\nSee,e.g.,Parkerv.Matthews, 567 U. S. ___\n(2012) (per curiam);Bobbyv.Dixon, 565 U. S.\n___ (2011) (per curiam);Bobbyv.Mitts, 563\nU. S. 395 (2011) (per curiam);Bobbyv.Van\nHook, 558 U. S. 4 (2009) (per curiam).The petition for certiorari and respondent\u2019s motion to proceedin forma pauperisare granted. The judgment of the Court of\nAppeals for the Sixth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded\nfor further proceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.",
