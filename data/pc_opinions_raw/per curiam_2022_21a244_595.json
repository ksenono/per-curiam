The mandate,\nwhich employers must enforce, applies to roughly 84 million\nworkers, covering virtually all employers with at least 100\nemployees. It requires that covered workers receive a COVID\u201319\nvaccine, and it pre-empts contrary state laws. The only exception\nis for workers who obtain a medical test each week at their own\nexpense and on their own time, and also wear a mask each workday.\nOSHA has never before imposed such a mandate. Nor has Congress.\nIndeed, although Congress has enacted significant legislation\naddressing the COVID\u201319 pandemic, it has declined to enact any\nmeasure similar to what OSHA has promulgated here.Many States, businesses, and nonprofit\norganizations challenged OSHA\u2019s rule in Courts of Appeals across\nthe country. The Fifth Circuit initially entered a stay. But when\nthe cases were consolidated before the Sixth Circuit, that court\nlifted the stay and allowed OSHA\u2019s rule to take effect. Applicants\nnow seek emergency relief from this Court, arguing that OSHA\u2019s\nmandate exceeds its statutory authority and is otherwise unlawful.\nAgreeing that applicants are likely to prevail, we grant their\napplications and stay the rule.IACongress enacted the Occupational Safety and\nHealth Act in 1970. 84 Stat. 1590, 29 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7651et\u00a0seq.The Act created the Occupational Safety and\nHealth Administration (OSHA), which is part of the Department of\nLabor and under the supervision of its Secretary. As its name\nsuggests, OSHA is tasked with ensuringoccupationalsafety\u2014that is, \u201csafe and healthful working conditions.\u201d \u00a7651(b).\nIt does so by enforcing occupational safety and health standards\npromulgated by the Secretary. \u00a7655(b). Such standards must be\n\u201creasonably necessary or appropriate to provide safe or healthfulemployment.\u201d \u00a7652(8) (emphasis added). They must also be\ndeveloped using a rigorous process that includes notice, comment,\nand an opportunity for a public hearing. \u00a7655(b).The Act contains an exception to those ordinary\nnotice-and-comment procedures for \u201cemergency temporary standards.\u201d\n\u00a7655(c)(1). Such standards may \u201ctake immediate effect upon\npublication in the Federal Register.\u201dIbid.They are\npermissible, however, only in the narrowest of circumstances: the\nSecretary must show (1) \u201cthat employees are exposed to grave danger\nfrom exposure to substances or agents determined to be toxic or\nphysically harmful or from new hazards,\u201d and (2) that the\n\u201cemergency standard is necessary to protect employees from such\ndanger.\u201dIbid.Prior to the emergence of COVID\u201319, the\nSecretary had used this power just nine times before (and never to\nissue a rule as broad as this one). Of those nine emergency rules,\nsix were challenged in court, and only one of those was upheld in\nfull. SeeBST Holdings, L.L.C.v.Occupational Safety and\nHealth Admin., 17 F.\u00a04th 604, 609 (CA5 2021).BOn September 9, 2021, President Biden\nannounced \u201ca new plan to require more Americans to be vaccinated.\u201d\nRemarks on the COVID\u201319 Response and National Vaccination Efforts,\n2021 Daily Comp. of Pres. Doc. 775, p.\u00a02. As part of that\nplan, the President said that the Department of Labor would issue\nan emergency rule requiring all employers with at least 100\nemployees \u201cto ensure their workforces are fully vaccinated or show\na negative test at least once a week.\u201dIbid.The purpose of\nthe rule was to increase vaccination rates at \u201cbusinesses all\nacross America.\u201dIbid.In tandem with other planned\nregulations, the administration\u2019s goal was to impose \u201cvaccine\nrequirements\u201d on \u201cabout 100 million Americans, two-thirds of all\nworkers.\u201dId.,at 3.After a 2-month delay, the Secretary of Labor\nissued the promised emergency standard. 86 Fed. Reg. 61402 (2021).\nConsistent with President Biden\u2019s announcement, the rule applies to\nall who work for employers with 100 or more employees. There are\nnarrow exemptions for employees who work remotely \u201c100 percent of\nthe time\u201d or who \u201cwork exclusively outdoors,\u201d but those exemptions\nare largely illusory.Id.,at 61460. The Secretary has\nestimated, for example, that only nine percent of landscapers and\ngroundskeepers qualify as working exclusively outside.Id.,at 61461. The regulation otherwise operates as a blunt instrument.\nIt draws no distinctions based on industry or risk of exposure to\nCOVID\u201319. Thus, most lifeguards and linemen face the same\nregulations as do medics and meatpackers. OSHA estimates that 84.2\nmillion employees are subject to its mandate.Id.,at\n61467.Covered employers must \u201cdevelop, implement, and\nenforce a mandatory COVID\u201319 vaccination policy.\u201dId., at\n61402. The employer must verify the vaccination status of each\nemployee and maintain proof of it.Id., at 61552. The\nmandate does contain an \u201cexception\u201d for employers that require\nunvaccinated workers to \u201cundergo [weekly] COVID\u201319 testing and wear\na face covering at work in lieu of vaccination.\u201dId., at\n61402. But employers are not required to offer this option, and the\nemergency regulation purports to pre-empt state laws to the\ncontrary.Id.,at 61437. Unvaccinated employees who do not\ncomply with OSHA\u2019s rule must be \u201cremoved from the workplace.\u201dId.,at 61532. And employers who commit violations face\nhefty fines: up to $13,653 for a standard violation, and up to\n$136,532 for a willful one. 29 CFR \u00a71903.15(d) (2021).COSHA published its vaccine mandate on November\n5, 2021. Scores of parties\u2014including States, businesses, trade\ngroups, and nonprofit organizations\u2014filed petitions for review,\nwith at least one petition arriving in each regional Court of\nAppeals. The cases were consolidated in the Sixth Circuit, which\nwas selected at random pursuant to 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a72112(a).Prior to consolidation, however, the Fifth\nCircuit stayed OSHA\u2019s rule pending further judicial review.BST\nHoldings, 17 F.\u00a04th 604. It held that the mandate likely\nexceeded OSHA\u2019s statutory authority, raised separation-of-powers\nconcerns in the absence of a clear delegation from Congress, and\nwas not properly tailored to the risks facing different types of\nworkers and workplaces.When the consolidated cases arrived at the Sixth\nCircuit, two things happened. First, many of the petitioners\u2014nearly\n60 in all\u2014requested initial hearing en banc. Second, OSHA asked the\nCourt of Appeals to vacate the Fifth Circuit\u2019s existing stay. The\nSixth Circuit denied the request for initial hearing en banc by an\nevenly divided 8-to-8 vote.In\u00a0re MCP No. 165, 20 F.\n4th 264 (2021). Chief Judge Sutton dissented, joined by seven of\nhis colleagues. He reasoned that the Secretary\u2019s \u201cbroad assertions\nof administrative power demand unmistakable legislative support,\u201d\nwhich he found lacking.Id.,at 268. A three-judge panel\nthen dissolved the Fifth Circuit\u2019s stay, holding that OSHA\u2019s\nmandate was likely consistent with the agency\u2019s statutory and\nconstitutional authority. SeeIn\u00a0re MCP No. 165, 2021\nWL 5989357, ___ F. 4th ___ (CA6 2021). Judge Larsen dissented.Various parties then filed applications in this\nCourt requesting that we stay OSHA\u2019s emergency standard. We\nconsolidated two of those applications\u2014one from the National\nFederation of Independent Business, and one from a coalition of\nStates\u2014and heard expedited argument on January 7, 2022.IIThe Sixth Circuit concluded that a stay of the\nrule was not justified. We disagree.AApplicants are likely to succeed on the merits\nof their claim that the Secretary lacked authority to impose the\nmandate. Administrative agencies are creatures of statute. They\naccordingly possess only the authority that Congress has provided.\nThe Secretary has ordered 84 million Americans to either obtain a\nCOVID\u201319 vaccine or undergo weekly medical testing at their own\nexpense. This is no \u201ceveryday exercise of federal power.\u201dIn\u00a0re MCP No. 165, 20 F. 4th, at 272 (Sutton,\nC.\u00a0J., dissenting). It is instead a significant encroachment\ninto the lives\u2014and health\u2014of a vast number of employees. \u201cWe expect\nCongress to speak clearly when authorizing an agency to exercise\npowers of vast economic and political significance.\u201dAlabama\nAssn. of Realtorsv.Department of Health and Human\nServs., 594 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2021) (per\u00a0curiam)\n(slip op., at 6) (internal quotation marks omitted). There can be\nlittle doubt that OSHA\u2019s mandate qualifies as an exercise of such\nauthority.The question, then, is whether the Act plainly\nauthorizes the Secretary\u2019s mandate. It does not. The Act empowers\nthe Secretary to setworkplacesafety standards, not broad\npublic health measures. See 29 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7655(b)\n(directing the Secretary to set \u201coccupationalsafety and\nhealth standards\u201d (emphasis added)); \u00a7655(c)(1) (authorizing the\nSecretary to impose emergency temporary standards necessary to\nprotect \u201cemployees\u201d from grave danger in the workplace). Confirming\nthe point, the Act\u2019s provisions typically speak to hazards that\nemployees face at work. See,e.g.,\u00a7\u00a7651, 653, 657. And no\nprovision of the Act addresses public health more generally, which\nfalls outside of OSHA\u2019s sphere of expertise.The dissent protests that we are imposing \u201ca\nlimit found no place in the governing statute.\u201dPost, at 7\n(joint opinion of Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan, JJ.). Not so. It is\nthe text of the agency\u2019s Organic Act that repeatedly makes clear\nthat OSHA is charged with regulating \u201coccupational\u201d hazards and the\nsafety and health of \u201cemployees.\u201d See,e.g.,29\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a7652(8), 654(a)(2), 655(b)\u2013(c).The Solicitor General does not dispute that OSHA\nis limited to regulating \u201cwork-related dangers.\u201d Response Brief for\nOSHA in No. 21A244 etc., p.\u00a045 (OSHA Response). She instead\nargues that the risk of contracting COVID\u201319 qualifies as such a\ndanger. We cannot agree. Although COVID\u201319 is a risk that occurs in\nmany workplaces, it is not anoccupationalhazard in most.\nCOVID\u201319 can and does spread at home, in schools, during sporting\nevents, and everywhere else that people gather. That kind of\nuniversal risk is no different from the day-to-day dangers that all\nface from crime, air pollution, or any number of communicable\ndiseases. Permitting OSHA to regulate the hazards of daily\nlife\u2014simply because most Americans have jobs and face those same\nrisks while on the clock\u2014would significantly expand OSHA\u2019s\nregulatory authority without clear congressional authorization.The dissent contends that OSHA\u2019s mandate is\ncomparable to a fire or sanitation regulation imposed by the\nagency. Seepost, at 7\u20139. But a vaccine mandate is\nstrikingly unlike the workplace regulations that OSHA has typically\nimposed. A vaccination, after all, \u201ccannot be undone at the end of\nthe workday.\u201dIn\u00a0re MCP No. 165, 20 F. 4th, at 274\n(Sutton, C.\u00a0J., dissenting). Contrary to the dissent\u2019s\ncontention, imposing a vaccine mandate on 84 million Americans in\nresponse to a worldwide pandemic is simply not \u201cpart of what the\nagency was built for.\u201dPost, at 10.That is not to say OSHA lacks authority to\nregulate occupation-specific risks related to COVID\u201319. Where the\nvirus poses a special danger because of the particular features of\nan employee\u2019s job or workplace, targeted regulations are plainly\npermissible. We do not doubt, for example, that OSHA could regulate\nresearchers who work with the COVID\u201319 virus. So too could OSHA\nregulate risks associated with working in particularly crowded or\ncramped environments. But the danger present in such workplaces\ndiffers in both degree and kind from the everyday risk of\ncontracting COVID\u201319 that all face. OSHA\u2019s indiscriminate approach\nfails to account for this crucial distinction\u2014between occupational\nrisk and risk more generally\u2014and accordingly the mandate takes on\nthe character of a general public health measure, rather than an\n\u201coccupationalsafety or health standard.\u201d 29\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7655(b) (emphasis added).In looking for legislative support for the\nvaccine mandate, the dissent turns to the American Rescue Plan Act\nof 2021, Pub. L. 117\u20132, 135 Stat. 4. Seepost, at 8. That\nlegislation, signed into law on March 11, 2021, of course said\nnothing about OSHA\u2019s vaccine mandate, which was not announced until\nsix months later. In fact, the most noteworthy action concerning\nthe vaccine mandate by either House of Congress has been a majority\nvote of the Senate disapproving the regulation on December 8, 2021.\nS.\u00a0J. Res. 29, 117th Cong., 1st Sess. (2021).It is telling that OSHA, in its half century of\nexistence, has never before adopted a broad public health\nregulation of this kind\u2014addressing a threat that is untethered, in\nany causal sense, from the workplace. This \u201clack of historical\nprecedent,\u201d coupled with the breadth of authority that the\nSecretary now claims, is a \u201ctelling indication\u201d that the mandate\nextends beyond the agency\u2019s legitimate reach.Free Enterprise\nFundv.Public Company Accounting Oversight Bd.,561 U.S.\n477, 505 (2010) (internal quotation marks omitted).[1]BThe equities do not justify withholding\ninterim relief. We are told by the States and the employers that\nOSHA\u2019s mandate will force them to incur billions of dollars in\nunrecoverable compliance costs and will cause hundreds of thousands\nof employees to leave their jobs. See Application in No. 21A244,\npp.\u00a025\u201332; Application in No. 21A247, pp.\u00a032\u201333; see also\n86 Fed. Reg. 61475. For its part, the Federal Government says that\nthe mandate will save over 6,500 lives and prevent hundreds of\nthousands of hospitalizations. OSHA Response 83; see also 86 Fed.\nReg. 61408.It is not our role to weigh such tradeoffs. In\nour system of government, that is the responsibility of those\nchosen by the people through democratic processes. Although\nCongress has indisputably given OSHA the power to regulate\noccupational dangers, it has not given that agency the power to\nregulate public health more broadly. Requiring the vaccination of\n84 million Americans, selected simply because they work for\nemployers with more than 100 employees, certainly falls in the\nlatter category.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*The applications for stays presented to\nJustice Kavanaugh and by him referred to the Court are granted.OSHA\u2019s COVID\u201319 Vaccination and Testing;\nEmergency Temporary Standard, 86 Fed. Reg. 61402, is stayed pending\ndisposition of the applicants\u2019 petitions for review in the United\nStates Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit and disposition of\nthe applicants\u2019 petitions for writs of certiorari, if such writs\nare timely sought. Should the petitions for writs of certiorari be\ndenied, this order shall terminate automatically. In the event the\npetitions for writs of certiorari are granted, the order shall\nterminate upon the sending down of the judgment of this Court.It is so ordered.Notes1The dissent says that we\ndo \u201cnot contest,\u201dpost, at 6, that the mandate was otherwise\nproper under the requirements for an emergency temporary standard,\nsee 29 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7655(c)(1). To be clear, we express no\nview on issues not addressed in this opinion.",
