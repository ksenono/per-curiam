    "text": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESKEITH THARPEv.ERIC SELLERS,\nWARDENon petition for writ of certiorari to the\nunited states court of appeals for the eleventh circuitNo. 17\u20136075.\u2003Decided January 8, 2018Per Curiam.Petitioner Keith Tharpe moved to reopen his\nfederal habeas corpus proceedings regarding his claim that the\nGeorgia jury that convicted him of murder included a white juror,\nBarney Gattie, who was biased against Tharpe because he is black.\nSee Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 60(b)(6). The District Court denied the\nmotion on the ground that, among other things, Tharpe\u2019s claim was\nprocedurally defaulted in state court. The District Court also\nnoted that Tharpe could not overcome that procedural default\nbecause he had failed to produce any clear and convincing evidence\ncontradicting the state court\u2019s determination that Gattie\u2019s\npresence on the jury did not prejudice him. SeeTharpev.Warden, No. 5:10\u2013cv\u2013433 (MD Ga., Sept. 5, 2017), App. B to\nPet. for Cert. 19.Tharpe sought a certificate of appealability\n(COA). The Eleventh Circuit denied his COA application after\ndeciding that jurists of reason could not dispute that the District\nCourt\u2019s procedural ruling was correct. SeeTharpev.Warden, 2017 WL 4250413, *3 (Sept. 21, 2017). The Eleventh\nCircuit\u2019s decision, as we read it, was based solely on its\nconclusion, rooted in the state court\u2019s factfinding, that Tharpe\nhad failed to show prejudice in connection with his procedurally\ndefaulted claim,i.e., that Tharpe had \u201cfailed to\ndemonstrate that Barney Gattie\u2019s behavior \u2018had substantial and\ninjurious effect or influence in determining the jury\u2019s\nverdict.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIbid.(quotingBrechtv.Abrahamson, 507 U.\u00a0S. 619, 637 (1993) ).Our review of the record compels a different\nconclusion. The state court\u2019s prejudice determination rested on its\nfinding that Gattie\u2019s vote to impose the death penalty was not\nbased on Tharpe\u2019s race. SeeTharpev.Warden, No.\n93\u2013cv\u2013144 (Super. Ct. Butts Cty., Ga., Dec. 1, 2008), App. F to\nPet. for Cert. 102. And that factual determination is binding on\nfederal courts, including this Court, in the absence of clear and\nconvincing evidence to the contrary. See 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a72254(e)(1). Here, however, Tharpe produced a sworn affidavit,\nsigned by Gattie, indicating Gattie\u2019s view that \u201cthere are two\ntypes of black people: 1. Black folks and 2. Niggers\u201d; that Tharpe,\n\u201cwho wasn\u2019t in the \u2018good\u2019 black folks category in my book, should\nget the electric chair for what he did\u201d; that \u201c[s]ome of the jurors\nvoted for death because they felt Tharpe should be an example to\nother blacks who kill blacks, but that wasn\u2019t my reason\u201d; and that,\n\u201c[a]fter studying the Bible, I have wondered if black people even\nhave souls.\u201d App. B to Pet. for Cert. 15\u201316 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). Gattie\u2019s remarkable affidavit\u2014which he never\nretracted\u2014presents a strong factual basis for the argument that\nTharpe\u2019s race affected Gattie\u2019s vote for a death verdict. At the\nvery least, jurists of reason could debate whether Tharpe has shown\nby clear and convincing evidence that the state court\u2019s factual\ndetermination was wrong. The Eleventh Circuit erred when it\nconcluded otherwise.The question of prejudice\u2014the ground on which\nthe Eleventh Circuit chose to dispose of Tharpe\u2019s application\u2014is\nnot the only question relevant to the broader inquiry whether\nTharpe should receive a COA. The District Court denied Tharpe\u2019s\nRule 60(b) motion on several grounds not addressed by the Eleventh\nCircuit. We express no view of those issues here. In light of the\nstandard for relief from judgment under Rule 60(b)(6), which is\navailable only in \u201c\u00a0\u2018extraordinary circumstances,\u2019\u00a0\u201dGonzalezv.Crosby, 545 U.\u00a0S. 524, 536 (2005) ,\nTharpe faces a high bar in showing that jurists of reason could\ndisagree whether the District Court abused its discretion in\ndenying his motion. It may be that, at the end of the day, Tharpe\nshould not receive a COA. And review of the denial of a COA is\ncertainly not limited to grounds expressly addressed by the court\nwhose decision is under review. But on the unusual facts of this\ncase, the Court of Appeals\u2019 review should not have rested on the\nground that it was indisputable among reasonable jurists that\nGattie\u2019s service on the jury did not prejudice Tharpe.We therefore grant Tharpe\u2019s motion to proceedin forma pauperis, grant the petition for certiorari, vacate\nthe judgment of the Court of Appeals, and remand the case for\nfurther consideration of the question whether Tharpe is entitled to\na COA.It is so ordered.",
