    "text": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESMELENE JAMESv.CITY OF BOISE, IDAHO,\net\u00a0al.on petition for writ of certiorari to the\nsupreme court of idahoNo. 15\u2013493.\u2003Decided January 25, 2016Per Curiam.Under federal law, a court has discretion to\n\u201callow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a\nreason-able attorney\u2019s fee\u201d in a civil rights lawsuit filed under\n42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71983. 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71988. InHughesv.Rowe, 449 U.\u00a0S. 5 (1980) (per\ncuriam), this Court interpreted \u00a71988 to permit a prevailing\ndefendant in such a suit to recover fees only if \u201cthe plaintiff\u2019s\naction was frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation.\u201dId.,at 14 (quotingChristiansburg Garment Co.v.EEOC, 434 U.\u00a0S. 412, 421 (1978) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted)).In the decision below, the Idaho Supreme Court\nconcluded that it was not bound by this Court\u2019s interpretation of\n\u00a71988 inHughes. According to that court, \u201c[a]lthough the\nSupreme Court may have the authority to limit the discretion of\nlower federal courts, it does not have the authority to limit the\ndiscretion of state courts where such limitation is not contained\nin the statute.\u201d 158 Idaho713, 734, 351 P.\u00a03d 1171, 1192\n(2015). The court then pro-ceeded to award attorney\u2019s fees under\n\u00a71988 to a prevailing defendant without first determining that \u201cthe\nplaintiff\u2019s action was frivolous, unreasonable, or without\nfoundation.\u201d The court\u2019s fee award rested solely on its\ninterpretation of federal law; the court explicitly refused to\naward fees under state law.Id., at 734\u2013735, 351 P.\u00a03d,\nat 1192\u20131193. We grant certiorari, and now reverse.Section 1988 is a federal statute. \u201cIt is this\nCourt\u2019s responsibility to say what a [federal] statute means, and\nonce the Court has spoken, it is the duty of other courts to\nrespect that understanding of the governing rule of law.\u201dNitro-Lift Technologies, L. L. C.v.Howard, 568\nU.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2012) (per curiam) (slip op., at 5)\n(quotingRiversv.Roadway Express, Inc., 511\nU.\u00a0S. 298, 312 (1994) (internal quotation marks omitted)). And\nfor good reason. As Justice Story explained 200 years ago, if state\ncourts were permitted to disregard this Court\u2019s rulings on federal\nlaw, \u201cthe laws, the treaties, and the constitution of the United\nStates would be different in different states, and might, perhaps,\nnever have precisely the same construction, obligation, or\nefficacy, in any two states. The public mischiefs that would attend\nsuch a state of things would be truly deplorable.\u201dMartinv.Hunter\u2019s Lessee, 1 Wheat. 304, 348 (1816).The Idaho Supreme Court, like any other state or\nfed-eral court, is bound by this Court\u2019s interpretation of federal\nlaw. The state court erred in concluding otherwise. The judgment of\nthe Idaho Supreme Court is reversed, and the case is remanded for\nfurther proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.",
