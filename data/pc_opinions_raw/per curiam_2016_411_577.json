    "text": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESJAIME CAETANOv.MASSACHUSETTSon petition for writ of certiorari to the\nsupreme judicial court of massachusettsNo. 14\u201310078.\u2003Decided March 21, 2016Per Curiam.The Court has held that \u201cthe Second Amendment\nextends, prima facie, to all instruments that constitute bearable\narms, even those that were not in existence at the time of the\nfounding,\u201dDistrict of Columbiav.Heller, 554\nU.\u00a0S. 570, 582 (2008) , and that this \u201c Second Amendment right\nis fully applicable to the States,\u201dMcDonaldv.Chicago, 561 U.\u00a0S. 742, 750 (2010) . In this case, the\nSupreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts upheld a Massachusetts law\nprohibiting the possession of stun guns after examining \u201cwhether a\nstun gun is the type of weapon contemplated by Congress in 1789 as\nbeing protected by the Second Amendment.\u201d 470 Mass. 774, 777, 26\nN.\u00a0E.\u00a03d 688, 691 (2015).The court offered three explanations to support\nits holding that the Second Amendment does not extend to stun guns.\nFirst, the court explained that stun guns are not protected because\nthey \u201cwere not in common use at the time of the Second Amendment\u2019s\nenactment.\u201dId.,at 781, 26 N.\u00a0E. 3d, at 693. This is\ninconsistent withHeller\u2019s clear statement that the Second\nAmendment \u201cextends .\u00a0.\u00a0. to .\u00a0.\u00a0. arms\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. that were not in existence at the time of the\nfounding.\u201d 554 U.\u00a0S., at 582.The court next asked whether stun guns are\n\u201cdangerous per\u00a0se at common law and unusual,\u201d 470 Mass., at\n781, 26 N.\u00a0E.\u00a03d, at 694, in an attempt to apply one\n\u201cimportant limitation on the right to keep and carry arms,\u201dHeller, 554 U.\u00a0S., at 627; seeibid.(referring\nto \u201cthe historical tradition of prohibiting the carrying of\n\u2018dangerous and unusual weapons\u2019\u00a0\u201d). In so doing, the court\nconcluded that stun guns are \u201cunusual\u201d because they are \u201ca\nthoroughly modern invention.\u201d 470 Mass., at 781, 26\nN.\u00a0E.\u00a03d, at 693\u2013694. By equating \u201cunusual\u201d with \u201cin\ncommon use at the time of the Second Amendment\u2019s enactment,\u201d the\ncourt\u2019s second explanation is the same as the first; it is\ninconsistent withHellerfor the same reason.Finally, the court used \u201ca contemporary lens\u201d\nand found \u201cnothing in the record to suggest that [stun guns] are\nreadily adaptable to use in the military.\u201d 470 Mass., at 781, 26\nN.\u00a0E.\u00a03d, at 694. ButHellerrejected the\nproposition \u201cthat only those weapons useful in warfare are\nprotected.\u201d 554 U.\u00a0S., at 624\u2013625.For these three reasons, the explanation the\nMassachusetts court offered for upholding the law contradicts this\nCourt\u2019s precedent. Consequently, the petition for a writ of\ncertiorari and the motion for leave to proceedin forma\npauperisare granted. The judgment of the Supreme Judicial\nCourt of Massachusetts is vacated, and the case is remanded for\nfurther proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.",
