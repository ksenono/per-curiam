The existence of\nprobable cause does not defeat a plaintiff\u00a0\u2019s claim if he\nproduces \u201cobjective evidence that he was arrested when otherwise\nsimilarly situated individuals not engaged in the same sort of\nprotected speech had not been.\u201dId., at 407. We granted\ncertiorari in this case to consider whether the Fifth Circuit\nproperly applied these principles. It did not. We therefore vacate\nthat court\u2019s judgment and remand for proceedings consistent with\nthis opinion.IIn 2019, Sylvia Gonzalez ran for a seat on the\ncity council of Castle Hills, a small town in southern Texas. While\nshe was on the campaign trail, Gonzalez heard multiple complaints\nabout the city manager, Ryan Rapelye. As city manager, Rapelye was\nresponsible for, among other things, enforcing the city\u2019s laws and\nmanaging its budget.Gonzalez was elected in May 2019. Her first act\nin office was to help gather signatures for a petition seeking\nRapelye\u2019s removal. Eventually, over 300 residents signed the\npetition. The petition was introduced at the next city council\nmeeting, where discussions grew heated after various residents rose\nto Rapelye\u2019s defense and spoke against Gonzalez. The discussion\nover the petition continued the next day.At the end of the second day, Gonzalez was\npacking up her belongings when the mayor, Edward Trevino, II, asked\nher for the petition. Gonzalez indicated that the petition was in\nTrevino\u2019s possession, which he denied. He then asked Gonzalez to\ncheck her binder, where she found the petition. Gonzalez claims\nthat she \u201cdid not intentionally put the petition in her binder,\u201d\nand that she was \u201csurprise[d]\u201d to find it there. Complaint and Jury\nDemand in No. 5:20\u2013cv\u201301151 (WD Tex., Sept. 9, 2020), ECF Doc. 1,\np.\u00a011.Trevino brought this incident to the city\npolice\u2019s attention, and an investigation into these events soon\nbegan. Within a month, a private attorney tasked with leading the\ninvestigation concluded that Gonzalez had likely violated a Texas\nanti-tampering statute that, among other things, prohibits a person\nfrom intentionally \u201cremov[ing] .\u00a0.\u00a0. a governmental\nrecord.\u201d Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a737.10(a)(3), (c)(1) (West Cum.\nSupp. 2023).[1]On the private attorney\u2019s request, a local\nMagistrate granted a warrant for Gonzalez\u2019s arrest. When she heard\nthe news, Gonzalez turned herself in and spent an evening in jail.\nThe district attorney ultimately dismissed the charges. Gonzalez\nclaims that this episode has convinced her to step away from\npolitical life.Gonzalez brought suit under 42\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71983, in Federal District Court against Trevino\nalong with the police chief and the private attorney in their\nindividual capacities.[2] Her\ncomplaint alleged that she was arrested in retaliation for her role\nin organizing the petition for Rapelye\u2019s removal and that the\ndefendants therefore violated her First Amendment rights.To bolster her claim, Gonzalez alleged that she\nhad reviewed the past decade\u2019s misdemeanor and felony data for\nBexar County (where Castle Hills is located) and that her review\nhad found that the Texas anti-tampering statute had never been used\nin the county \u201cto criminally charge someone for trying to steal a\nnonbinding or expressive document.\u201d ECF Doc. 1, at 17. Gonzalez\u2019s\nsearch turned up 215 felony indictments, and she characterized the\ntypical indictment as involving \u201caccusations of either using or\nmaking fake government identification documents.\u201dIbid.\nOther felony indictments included ones for fake checks, hiding\nmurder evidence, or cheating on government exams. Every misdemeanor\ncase, according to Gonzalez, involved \u201cfake social security\nnumbers, driver\u2019s licenses, [or] green cards.\u201dIbid.\nGonzalez pointed to this research as evidence that the defendants\nhad engaged in a political vendetta by bringing a \u201csham charge\u201d\nagainst her.Id., at 27.The defendants moved to dismiss the complaint.\nThey argued that the presence of probable cause defeated Gonzalez\u2019s\nretaliatory-arrest claims against the individual defendants. The\nDistrict Court denied the defendants\u2019 motion. Although Gonzalez\nconceded that probable cause supported her arrest, the court\nallowed her claim to advance after finding that it fell within an\nexception to the no-probable-cause rule that we recognized inNieves.Gonzalezv.Castle Hills, 2021 WL\n4046758, *5, n.\u00a07 (WD Tex., Mar. 12, 2021).The Fifth Circuit reversed that decision on\nappeal. The court thought that a plaintiff\u00a0\u2019s claim could fall\nwithin theNievesexception only if the plaintiff proffered\n\u201ccomparative evidence\u201d of \u201cotherwise similarly situated individuals\nwho engaged in the same criminal conduct but were not arrested.\u201d 42\nF.\u00a04th 487, 493 (2022) (internal quotation marks omitted).\nGonzalez\u2019s claim failed because she did not provide such\nevidence.We granted certiorari. 601 U.\u00a0S. ___\n(2023).IIGonzalez seeks reversal on two grounds. First,\nshe asks us to reject the Fifth Circuit\u2019s rule that plaintiffs must\nuse specific comparator evidence to demonstrate that they fall\nwithin theNievesexception. Second, Gonzalez contends that\ntheNievesno-probable-cause rule applies only to claims\npredicated on split-second arrests, rather than deliberative\nones.We agree with Gonzalez that the Fifth Circuit\ntook an overly cramped view ofNieves. That court thought\nGonzalez had to provide very specific comparator evidence\u2014that is,\nexamples of identifiable people who \u201cmishandled a government\npetition\u201d in the same way Gonzalez did but were not arrested. 42\nF.\u00a04th, at 492. Although theNievesexception is slim,\nthe demand for virtually identical and identifiable comparators\ngoes too far.We recognized theNievesexception to\naccount for \u201ccircumstances where officers have probable cause to\nmake arrests, but typically exercise their discretion not to do\nso.\u201d 587 U.\u00a0S., at 406. To fall within the exception, a\nplaintiff must produce evidence to prove that his arrest occurred\nin such circumstances. The only express limit we placed on the sort\nof evidence a plaintiff may present for that purpose is that it\nmust be objective in order to avoid \u201cthe significant problems that\nwould arise from reviewing police conduct under a purely subjective\nstandard.\u201dId., at 407.Here, Gonzalez provided that sort of evidence.\nShe was charged with intentionally \u201cremov[ing] .\u00a0.\u00a0. a\ngovernmental record.\u201d Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a737.10(a)(3). Gonzalez\u2019s\nsurvey is a permissible type of evidence because the fact that no\none has ever been arrested for engaging in a certain kind of\nconduct\u2014especially when the criminal prohibition is longstanding\nand the conduct at issue is not novel\u2014makes it more likely that an\nofficerhasdeclined to arrest someone for engaging in such\nconduct in the past.Because we agree with Gonzalez\u2019s first argument,\nwe do not need to reach her second. We vacate the judgment below\nand remand the case for the lower courts to assess whether\nGonzalez\u2019s evidence suffices to satisfy theNievesexception.It is so ordered.Notes1The statute also\nprohibits a person from intentionally \u201cdestroy[ing],\u201d\n\u201cconceal[ing],\u201d or \u201cotherwise impair[ing] the verity, legibility,\nor availability\u201d of a governmental record.2She also pressed a claim\nin this action against Castle Hills. That claim is not before\nus.",
