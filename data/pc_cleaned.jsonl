Decided May , 2010Per Curiam.Petitioner Lawrence Jefferson, who has been sentenced to death, claimed in both state and federal courts that his lawyers were constitutionally inadequate because they failed to investigate a traumatic head injury that he suffered as a child. The state court rejected that claim after making a finding that the attorneys were advised by an expert that such investigation was unnecessary. Under the governing federal statute, that factual finding is presumed correct unless any one of eight exceptions applies. See U. S. C. §§(d)(1)–(8) ( ed.). But the Court of Appeals considered only one of those exceptions (specifically §(d)(8)). And on that basis, it considered itself “duty-bound” to accept the state court’s finding, and rejected Jefferson’s claim. Because the Court of Appeals did not fully consider several remaining potentially applicable exceptions, we vacate its judgment and remand.IWhen Jefferson was a child, he “suffered a serious injury to his head.”Jeffersonv.Terry, F. Supp. 2d , (ND Ga. ); seeid.,at (quoting Jefferson’s mother’s testimony that “a car ran over the top of his head” when he was two years old). The accident left his skull swollen and misshapen and his forehead visibly scarred.Jeffersonv.Hall, F. 3d , , , n. 4 ( ) (Carnes, J., dissenting). During the District Court proceedings below, uncontroverted experts testified that, as a result of his head injury, Jefferson has “permanent brain damage” that “causes abnormal behavior” over which he “has no or substantially limited control.” F. Supp. 2d, at –. According to these experts, Jefferson’s condition causes “ ‘emotional dullness,’ ” “ ‘restless or aggressive characteristics,’ ” “ ‘impulsiveness,’ ” “ ‘temper outbursts,’ ” “ ‘markedly diminished impulse control,’ ” “ ‘impaired social judgment,’ ” and “ ‘transient outbursts of rage which are totally inconsistent with his normal behavioral pattern.’ ”Id.,at , .The experts further testified that Jefferson’s “ ‘severe cognitive disabilities’ ” “ ‘profoundly alter’ ” his “ ‘ability to plan and coordinate his actions, to be aware of the consequences of his behavior, and to engage in premeditated or intentional acts.’ ”Id.,at . But they testified he is neither psychotic nor retarded.Id.,at . Thus, they said, to a lay observer or even to a professional psychologist, Jefferson does not outwardly appear mentally impaired. Indeed, according to the experts, “ ‘the behavior that may result from’ ” his condition “ ‘could, without the administration of proper testing, be mistaken for volitional.’ ”Id.,at .Jefferson faced a death sentence for killing his co-worker while the two men were fishing.Id.,at –. Prior to trial, he was examined by a psychologist named Dr. Gary Dudley, who prepared a formal report in which he concluded that Jefferson’s mental deficiencies do not impair “ ‘his judgment or decision-making capacity.’ ” F. 3d, at (quoting report). But Dr. Dudley’s report included a caveat: “ ‘One possibility that could not be explored because of [Jefferson’s] incarceration has to do with the sequelae,’ ”i.e.,pathologies, related to a “ ‘head injury experienced during childhood.’ ”Ibid.“ ‘In my opinion,’ ” he wrote, “ ‘it would be worthwhile to conduct neuropsychological evaluation of this individual to rule out an organic etiology,’ ”i.e.,to rule out brain damage.Ibid.Although “it is undisputed that the testing” Dr. Dudley recommended “could have easily been performed,” F. Supp. 2d, at , and that Jefferson’s attorneys possessed police reports and hospital records recounting his head injury,id.,at , the attorneys did not have Jefferson tested. At sentencing, they presented only testimony from two prison guards, who stated that Jefferson was an unproblematic inmate, and from three members of Jefferson’s family, who testified that he is a “responsible, generous, gentle, and kind” person and “a good father.” F. 3d, at –. And while Jefferson’s mother briefly mentioned the car accident, “she was not questioned and did not offer any testimony regarding the impact, if any, that the accident had on him.”Id.,at . Thus, “[a]s far as the jury knew, Jefferson did not suffer from brain damage or neurological impairment; he had no organic disorders”; and “his emotional stability, impulse control, and judgment were perfectly normal.”Id.,at (Carnes, J., dissenting).Jefferson sought habeas relief in state court, arguing that his two trial attorneys unreasonably failed to pursue brain-damage testing. In response, the trial attorneys testified that they did not pursue such testing because, after delivering his formal written report, Dr. Dudley later told them that further investigation “ ‘may be a waste of time because the rest of [his] report’ ” had “ ‘said that [Jefferson] was non psychotic.’ ” F. 3d, at (quoting testimony). Dr. Dudley did not testify in person at the hearing, but he submitted a sworn affidavit denying that he had ever made such statements. He said “it had always been his expert opinion ‘that neuropsychological testing was necessary’ ” and that when he wrote as much in his formal report “he ‘meant it.’ ”Id.,at (Carnes, J., dissenting) (quoting affidavit). He added, “ ‘I never, before or after that report, suggested to [Jefferson’s attorneys] that such an evaluation was not necessary or that it would not be worthwhile.’ ”Ibid.;cf. Pet. for Cert. , n. .Jefferson contends, and the State has not disputed, that after the hearing concluded the state-court judge contacted the attorneys for the Stateex parte.And in a private conversation that included neither Jefferson nor his attorneys, the judge asked the State’s attorneys to draft the opinion of the court. Seeid., at 3, . According to Jefferson, no such request was made of him, nor was he informed of the request made to opposing counsel.Id.,at , n. 8, ; see alsoJeffersonv.Zant, Ga. , S. E. 2d , () (“Jefferson contends [the order] amounts to no more and no less than a reply brief to which [he] has not had a chance to respond”).The attorneys for the State prepared an opinion finding that “Dr. Dudley led [Jefferson’s trial attorneys] to believe that further investigation would simply be a waste of time because Petitioner [i]s not psychotic.”Jeffersonv.Zant, Civ. Action No. –V– (Super. Ct. Butts Cty., Ga., Oct. 7, ), p. , App. 4 to Pet. for Cert. (hereinafter State Order); see alsoid.,at . The opinion “specifically credits the testimony of [the trial attorneys] with regard to their efforts to investigate Petitioner’s mental condition.”Id.,at ; see alsoid.,at . And relying on these findings, it concludes that Jefferson’s attorneys “made a reasonable investigation into [his] mental health” and were thus not ineffective.Id.,at .Notably, as the Georgia Supreme Court acknowledged, the State’s opinion discusses statements purportedly made on Jefferson’s behalf by a witness “who did not testify” or participate in the proceedings. Ga., at , S. E. 2d, at ; see State Order –. Nonetheless, the opinion “was adopted verbatim by the [state] court.” Ga., at , S. E. 2d, at . And while the State Supreme Court recognized that we have “ ‘criticized’ ” such a practice, it affirmed the judgment.Id.,at , , S. E. 2d, at , (quotingAndersonv.Bessemer City, U. S. , ()).IIJefferson next sought federal habeas relief in the District Court. In his opening brief, he argued that “there is no reason under principles of comity or otherwise to give any deference to the findings of the State Habeas Corpus Court.” Brief for Petitioner in No. 1:–CV––CC (ND Ga.), Doc. , p. 4, and n. 1 (hereinafter District Court Brief). In support of that argument, he claimed that the state court “merely signed an order drafted by the State without revision of a single word,” even though the order “described witnesses who never testified.”Ibid.And he said that such a process “rais[es] serious doubts as to whether [the judge] even read, much less carefully considered, the proposed order submitted by the State.”Ibid.The District Court ruled in Jefferson’s favor. It noted that under the relevant statute “factual findings of state courts are presumed to be correct unless one of ... eight enumerated exceptions ... applies.” F. Supp. 2d, at ; see also id.,at , n. 5 (listing the exceptions). And it acknowledged “the state habeas corpus court’s failure to explain the basis” for its credibility findings.Id.,at , n. . But it accepted Jefferson’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel without disturbing the state court’s factual findings because it believed he should prevail even accepting those findings as true.Id.,at –.On appeal, Jefferson defended the District Court’s judgment primarily on its own terms. But he also argued that the state court’s factfinding was “dubious at best” in light of the process that court employed, and that the Court of Appeals therefore “should harbor serious doubts about the findings of fact and credibility determinations in the state court record.” Brief for Petitioner/Appellee in No. – (), pp. –, n. (hereinafter Appeals Brief).A divided Court of Appeals panel reversed, and Jefferson filed this petition for certiorari asking us to review his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. And, in so doing, he challenges—as he did in the State Supreme Court, the District Court, and the Court of Appeals—“the fact findings of the state court,” given what he describes as the deficient procedure employed by that court while reviewing his claim. Pet. for Cert. –, , n. , , n. (recounting “ ‘reason[s] to doubt’ ” the state court’s findings). Cf.Lebronv.National Railroad Passenger Corporation, U. S. , () (stating standard for preserving an issue for review in this Court).IIIThis habeas application was filed prior to the enactment of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of and is therefore governed by federal habeas law as it existed prior to that point.Lindhv.Murphy, U. S. , – (). In , we set forth the “appropriate standard” to be applied by a “federal court in habeas corpus” when “the facts” pertinent to a habeas application “are in dispute.”Townsendv.Sain, U. S. , . We held that when “the habeas applicant was afforded a full and fair hearing by the state court resulting in reliable findings” the district court “ordinarily should ... accept the facts as found” by the state-court judge.Id.,at . However, “if the habeas applicant did not receive a full and fair evidentiary hearing in a state court, either at the time of the trial or in a collateral proceeding,” we held that the federal court “must hold an evidentiary hearing” to resolve any facts that “are in dispute.”Id.,at . We further “explain[ed] the controlling criteria” by enumerating six circumstances in which such an evidentiary hearing would be required:“(1) the merits of the factual dispute were not resolved in the state hearing; (2) the state factual determination is not fairly supported by the record as a whole; (3)the fact-finding procedureemployed by the state courtwas not adequate to afford a full and fair hearing; (4) there is a substantial allegation of newly discovered evidence; (5) the material facts were not adequately developed at the state-court hearing; or (6)for any reason it appears that the state trier of fact did not afford the habeas applicant a full and fair fact hearing.”Id.,at (emphasis added).Three years later, in , Congress enacted an amendment to the federal habeas statute that “was an almost verbatim codification of the standards delineated inTownsendv.Sain.”Millerv.Fenton, U. S. , (). That codification read in relevant part as follows:“In any proceeding instituted in a Federal court by an application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court, a determination ... of a factual issue, made by a State court of competent jurisdiction ... , shall be presumed to be correct,unlessthe applicant shall establish or it shall otherwise appear, or the respondent shall admit—“(1) that the merits of the factual dispute were not resolved in the State court hearing;“(2)that the factfinding procedure employed by the State court was not adequate to afford a full and fair hearing;“(3) that the material facts were not adequately developed at the State court hearing;“(4) that the State court lacked jurisdiction of the subject matter or over the person of the applicant in the State court proceeding;“(5) that the applicant was an indigent and the State court, in deprivation of his constitutional right, failed to appoint counsel to represent him in the State court proceeding;“(6)that the applicant did not receive a full, fair, and adequate hearing in the State court proceeding; or“(7)that the applicant was otherwise denied due process of law in the State court proceeding;“(8)or unless ... the Federal court on a consideration of [the relevant] part of the record as a whole concludes that such factual determinationis not fairly supported by the record.” §(d) (emphasis added).As is clear from the statutory text quoted above, and as the District Court correctly stated, if any “one of the eight enumerated exceptions ... applies” then “the state court’s factfinding is not presumed correct.” F. Supp. 2d, at ; accord,Miller, supra,at (“Under U. S. C. §(d), state-court findings of fact ‘shall be presumed to be correct’ in a federal habeas corpus proceeding unless one of eight enumerated exceptions applies”); see also 1 R. Hertz & J. Liebman, Federal Habeas Corpus Practice and Procedure §.2c, pp. – (5th ed. ).Jefferson has consistently argued that the federal courts “should harbor serious doubts about” and should not “give any deference to” the “findings of fact and credibility determinations” made by the state habeas court because those findings were drafted exclusively by the attorneys for the State pursuant to anex parterequest from the state-court judge, who made no such request of Jefferson, failed to notify Jefferson of the request made to opposing counsel, and adopted the State’s proposed opinion verbatim even though it recounted evidence from a nonexistent witness. See,e.g.,Appeals Brief , n. ; District Court Brief 4, n. 1; Pet. for Cert. . These are arguments that the state court’sprocesswas deficient. In other words, they are arguments that Jefferson “did not receive a full and fair evidentiary hearing in ... state court.”Townsend, supra,at . Or, to use the statutory language, they are arguments that the state court’s “factfinding procedure,” “hearing,” and “proceeding” were not “full, fair, and adequate.” §§(d)(2), (6), (7).But the Court of Appeals did not consider the state court’s process when it applied the statutory presumption of correctness. Instead, it invoked Circuit precedent that applied only paragraph (8) of §(d), which, codifying the secondTownsendexception, U. S., at , lifts the presumption of correctness for findings that are “not fairly supported by the record.” See F. 3d, at (quotingJacksonv.Herring, F. 3d , ( ), in turn quoting U. S. C. §(d)(8)). And even though the Court of Appeals “recognize[d]” that Jefferson had argued that the state court’sprocesshad produced factual findings that were “ ‘dubious at best,’ ” and that federal courts should therefore “ ‘harbor serious doubts about’ ” the state court’s “ ‘findings of fact and credibility,’ ” the Court of Appeals nonetheless held that the state court’s findings are “ ‘entitled to a presumption of correctness’ ” that it was “duty-bound” to apply. F. 3d, at , n. 8 (quoting Appeals Brief , n. ). The Court of Appeals explicitly stated that it considered itself “duty-bound” to defer to the state court’s findings because “Jefferson has not argued that any of the state courts’ factual findings were ‘not fairly supported by the record,’ ” a direct reference to §(d)(8) and to the secondTownsendexception. F. 3d, at , n. 8 (emphasis added). And it then concluded: “Based on these factual findings of the state habeas courts—all of which arefairly supported by the record—we believe that Jefferson’s counsel were reasonable in deciding not to pursue neuropsychological testing.”Id.,at (emphasis added).In our view, the Court of Appeals did not properly consider the legal status of the state court’s factual findings. UnderTownsend, as codified by the governing statute, a federal court is not “duty-bound” to accept any and all state-court findings that are “fairly supported by the record.” Those words come from §(d)(8), which is only one of eight enumerated exceptions to the presumption of correctness. But there are seven others, see §§(d)(1)–(7), none of which the Court of Appeals considered when addressing Jefferson’s claim. To be sure, we have previously stated in casesapplying§(d)(8) that “a federal court” may not overturn a state court’s factual conclusion “unless the conclusion is not ‘fairly supported by the record.’ ”Parkerv.Dugger, U. S. , () (granting federal habeas relief after rejecting state court’s finding under §(d)(8)); see alsoDemosthenesv.Baal, U. S. ()(per curiam)(applying §(d)(8)); cf.post,at ([REDACTED], J., dissenting). But in those cases there was no suggestion that anyotherprovisions enumerated in §(d) were at issue. That is not the case here. In treating §(d)(8) as theexclusivestatutory exception, and by failing to address Jefferson’s argument that the state court’sproceduresdeprived its findings of deference, the Court of Appeals applied the statute and our precedents incorrectly.Although we have stated that a court’s “verbatim adoption of findings of fact prepared by prevailing parties” should be treated as findings of the court, we have also criticized that practice.Anderson, U. S., at . And we have not considered the lawfulness of, nor the application of the habeas statute to, the use of such a practice where (1) a judge solicits the proposed findingsex parte, (2) does not provide the opposing party an opportunity to criticize the findings or to submit his own, or (3) adopts findings that contain internal evidence suggesting that the judge may not have read them. Cf.id.,at ; Ga. Code of Judicial Conduct, Canon 3(A)(4) () (prohibitingex partejudicial communications).We decline to determine in the first instance whether any of the exceptions enumerated in §§(d)(1)–(8) apply in this case, see,e.g.,Cutterv.Wilkinson, U. S. , , n. 7 (), especially given that the facts surrounding the state habeas court’s process are undeveloped. Respondent has conceded that it drafted the state court’s final order at that court’s request and that the order was adopted verbatim, Ga., at , S. E. 2d, at , and has not disputed in this Court that the state court solicited the order “ex parteand without prior notice” and “did not seek a proposed order from Petitioner,” Pet. for Cert. , and n. 8. But the precise nature of what transpired during the state-court proceedings is not fully known. See Ga. at –, S. E. 2d, at (noting dispute as to whether Jefferson “had a chance to respond” to the final order); see also Pet. for Cert. .Accordingly, we believe it necessary for the lower courts to determine on remand whether the state court’s factual findings warrant a presumption of correctness, and to conduct any further proceedings as may be appropriate in light of their resolution of that issue. SeeTownsend, supra,at –;Keeneyv.Tamayo-Reyes, U. S. 1(). In so holding, we express no opinion as to whether Jefferson’s Sixth Amendment rights were violated assuming the state court’s factual findings to be true.* * *The petition for a writ of certiorari and motion to proceedin forma pauperisare granted. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered."}

Decided April 4, 2016Per Curiam.In the fall of , Michigan law enforcement received an anonymous tip that two white males were traveling on I– between Detroit and Grand Rapids in a white Audi, possibly carrying cocaine. Officers spotted a vehicle matching that description and pulled it over for speeding. Respondent Timothy Etherton was driving; Ryan Pollie was in the passenger seat. A search of the car uncovered .2 grams of cocaine in a compartment at the bottom of the driver side door. Both Etherton and Pollie were arrested.Etherton was tried in state court on a single count of possession with intent to deliver cocaine. At trial the facts reflected in the tip were not contested. The central point of contention was instead whether the cocaine belonged to Etherton or Pollie. Pollie testified for the prosecution pursuant to a plea agreement. He claimed that he had accompanied Etherton from Grand Rapids to Detroit, not knowing that Etherton intended to obtain cocaine there. According to Pollie, once the pair arrived in Detroit, Etherton left him alone at a restaurant and drove off, returning some minutes later. It was only after they were headed back to Grand Rapids that Etherton revealed he had obtained the drugs.The prosecution also called several police officers to testify. Three of the officers described the content of the anonymous tip leading to Etherton’s arrest. On the third recounting of the tip, Etherton’s counsel objected on hearsay grounds, but the objection was not resolved when the prosecutor agreed to move on. At closing, the prosecutor also described the tip. The court instructed the jury that “the tip was not evidence,” but was admitted “only to show why the police did what they did.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 88a. The jury convicted Etherton, and his conviction was affirmed on direct appeal. The Michigan Supreme Court denied leave to appeal.Peoplev.Etherton, Mich. , N.W.2d ().Etherton sought postconviction relief in state court on six grounds. Three are relevant here: First, he claimed that the admission of the anonymous tip violated his rights under the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment. Second, that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the tip on that ground. And third, that his counsel on direct appeal was ineffective for failing to raise the Confrontation Clause and the ineffective assistance of trial counsel claims.The state habeas court rejected the first two claims on procedural grounds and the third on the merits. To prevail on a claim for ineffective assistance of appellate counsel, the state court explained, Etherton had to demonstrate that “appellate counsel’s decision not to pursue an issue on appeal fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and that the representation so prejudiced [him] as to deprive him of a fair trial.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 87a–88a. The state court concluded that Etherton failed on both counts.First, the court reasoned, appellate counsel may have reasonably forgone any Confrontation Clause claim after concluding that trial counsel’s failure to object was the product not of ineffectiveness but of strategy. While Etherton’s current counsel argues that trial counsel should have objected because the tip’s reference to “two men” suggested involvement by Etherton from the outset, Brief in Opposition –, the reference also suggestedPollie’sprior involvement, contrary to his testimony that he was not with Etherton when he picked up the cocaine and had nothing to do with it. As the state court explained, not objecting would have been consistent with trial counsel’s “strategy to show defendant’s non-involvement and possible responsibility of the passenger (who was also charged).” App. to Pet. for Cert. 88a.Second, the court determined, Etherton had not been prejudiced by counsel’s choice: there was “ample evidence” of his guilt and “the complained of errors, even if true, would not have changed the outcome” of the case.Id.,at 89a. Etherton’s allegations, the court concluded, ultimately failed to overcome the presumption that his appellate counsel functioned reasonably in not pursuing the Confrontation Clause or ineffectiveness claims.Ibid.Both the Michigan Court of Appeals and the Michigan Supreme Court denied leave to appeal.Etherton next sought federal habeas relief. Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of (AEDPA), federal habeas relief was available to him only if the state court’s decision “was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.” U. S. C. §(d)(1). “A state court’s determination that a claim lacks merit precludes federal habeas relief so long as ‘fairminded jurists could disagree’ on the correctness of the state court’s decision.”Harringtonv.Richter, U.S. , () (quotingYarboroughv.Alvarado, U.S. , ()). The state court decision must be “so lacking in justification that there was an error well understood and comprehended in existing law beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.”Whitev.Woodall, U. S., at 4) (internal quotation marks omitted).When the claim at issue is one for ineffective assistance of counsel, moreover, AEDPA review is “doubly deferential,”Cullenv.Pinholster, U.S. , (), because counsel is “strongly presumed to have rendered adequate assistance and made all significant decisions in the exercise of reasonable professional judgment,”Burtv.Titlow, U. S., at 9) (quotingStricklandv.Washington, U.S. , (); internal quotation marks omitted). In such circumstances, federal courts are to afford “both the state court and the defense attorney the benefit of the doubt., at 1).The District Court denied relief, but the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed in relevant part, over the dissent of Judge Kethledge. The majority concluded that Etherton’s appellate counsel had been constitution- ally ineffective, and that no fairminded jurist could conclude otherwise.Ethertonv.Rivard, F.3d (). Without ruling on the merits of the court’s holding that counsel had been ineffective, we disagree with the determination that no fairminded jurist could reach a contrary conclusion, and accordingly reverse.In finding counsel ineffective, the majority first con- cluded that Etherton’s right to confrontation had been vio- lated. The Confrontation Clause prohibits an out-of-court statement only if it is admitted for its truth.Crawfordv.Washington, U.S. , , n. 9 (). The Sixth Circuit determined that the contents of the tip were admitted for their truth because the tip was referenced by three different witnesses and mentioned in closing argument. These “repeated references both to the existence and the details of the content of the tip went far beyond what was necessary for background,” the majority below concluded, “indicating the content of the tip was admitted for its truth.” F. 3d, at .The majority next found that Etherton had been prejudiced by the violation, a showing Etherton’s state court counsel would have had to make on appeal to obtain relief either on the forfeited Confrontation Clause objection, seePeoplev.Carines, Mich. , –, N.W.2d , – () (showing of prejudice required to overcome forfeiture), or the ineffectiveness claim,Strickland,supra, at (showing of prejudice required to demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel). In finding prejudice, the majority acknowledged the evidence of Etherton’s guilt: the cocaine was found in a driver side compartment inches from Etherton; he owned the car; and he was driving at the time of arrest. But, according to the majority, that evidence was not enough to convict Etherton absent Pollie’s testimony. And that is where the tip came in. “Because much of Pollie’s testimony was reflected in the content of the tip that was put before the jury,” the Sixth Circuit stated, “the jury could have improperly concluded that Pollie was thereby testifying truthfully—that it was unlikely for it to be a coincidence for his testimony to line up so well with the anonymous accusation.” F. 3d, at .In reaching these conclusions, the Sixth Circuit did not apply the appropriate standard of review under AEDPA. A “fairminded jurist” could conclude that repetition of the tip did not establish that the uncontested facts it conveyed were submitted for their truth. Such a jurist might reach that conclusion by placing weight on the fact that the truth of the facts was not disputed. No precedent of this Court clearly forecloses that view. It is also not beyond the realm of possibility that a fairminded jurist could conclude that Etherton was not prejudiced when the tip and Pollie’s testimony corresponded on uncontested facts. After all, Pollie himself was privy to all the information contained in the tip. A reasonable judge might accord- ingly regard the fact that the tip and Pollie’s testimony corre- sponded to be unremarkable and not pertinent to Pollie’s credibility. (In fact, the only point of Pollie’s testimony actually reflected in the tip was that he and Etherton were traveling between Detroit and Grand Rapids.)Etherton’s underlying complaint is that his appellate lawyer’s ineffectiveness meant he had “no prior opportu- nity to cross-examine the anonymous tipster.” Brief in Opposition . But it would not be objectively unreason- able for a fairminded judge to conclude—especially in light of the deference affordedtrialcounsel underStrickland—that the failure to raise such a claim was not due to incompetence but because the facts in the tip were uncontested and in any event consistent with Etherton’s defense. SeeHarrington, U. S., at (“Even underde novoreview, the standard for judging counsel’s representation is a most deferential one.”). A fairminded jurist could similarly conclude, again deferring underStrickland, thatappellatecounsel was not incompetent in drawing the same conclusion. And to reach the final point at issue before the Sixth Circuit, a fairminded jurist—applying the deference due thestate courtunder AEDPA—could certainly conclude that the court was not objectively unreasonable in deciding that appellate counsel was not incompetent underStrickland, when she determined that trial counsel was not incompetent underStrickland.Given AEDPA, both Etherton’s appellate counsel and the state habeas court were to be afforded the benefit of the doubt. Because the Sixth Circuit failed on both counts, we grant the petition for certiorari and reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.It is so ordered."}

Decided May 5, 2014Per Curiam.During the early morning hours of New Year’s Eve, , police sergeant Jeffrey Cotton fired three bullets at Robert Tolan; one of those bullets hit its target and punctured Tolan’s right lung. At the time of the shooting, Tolan was unarmed on his parents’ front porch about to feet away from Cotton. Tolan sued, alleging that Cotton had exercised excessive force in violation of the Fourth Amendment. The District Court granted summary judgment to Cotton, and the Fifth Circuit affirmed, reasoning that regardless of whether Cotton used excessive force, he was entitled to qualified immunity because he did not violate any clearly established right. F.3d (). In articulating the factual context of the case, the Fifth Circuit failed to adhere to the axiom that in ruling on a motion for summary judgment, “[t]he evidence of the nonmovant is to be believed, and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in his favor.”Andersonv.Liberty Lobby, Inc., U.S. , (). For that reason, we vacate its decision and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.IAThe following facts, which we view in the light most favorable to Tolan, are taken from the record evidence and the opinions below. At around 2: on the morning of December , , John Edwards, a police officer, was on patrol in Bellaire, Texas, when he noticed a black Nissan sport utility vehicle turning quickly onto a residential street. The officer watched the vehicle park on the side of the street in front of a house. Two men exited: Tolan and his cousin, Anthony Cooper.Edwards attempted to enter the license plate number of the vehicle into a computer in his squad car. But he keyed an incorrect character; instead of entering plate number 696BGK, he entered 695BGK. That incorrect number matched a stolen vehicle of the same color and make. This match caused the squad car’s computer to send an automatic message to other police units, informing them that Edwards had found a stolen vehicle.Edwards exited his cruiser, drew his service pistol and ordered Tolan and Cooper to the ground. He accused Tolan and Cooper of having stolen the car. Cooper responded, “That’s not true.” Record . And Tolan explained, “That’s my car.”Ibid.Tolan then complied with the officer’s demand to lie face-down on the home’s front porch.As it turned out, Tolan and Cooper were at the home where Tolan lived with his parents. Hearing the commotion, Tolan’s parents exited the front door in their paja- mas. In an attempt to keep the misunderstanding from escalating into something more, Tolan’s father instructed Cooper to lie down, and instructed Tolan and Cooper to say nothing. Tolan and Cooper then remained facedown.Edwards told Tolan’s parents that he believed Tolan and Cooper had stolen the vehicle. In response, Tolan’s father identified Tolan as his son, and Tolan’s mother explained that the vehicle belonged to the family and that no crime had been committed. Tolan’s father explained, with his hands in the air, “[T]his is my nephew. This is my son. We live here. This is my house.”Id., at . Tolan’s mother similarly offered, “[S]ir this is a big mistake. This car is not stolen. . . . That’s our car.”Id., at .While Tolan and Cooper continued to lie on the ground in silence, Edwards radioed for assistance. Shortly thereafter, Sergeant Jeffrey Cotton arrived on the scene and drew his pistol. Edwards told Cotton that Cooper and Tolan had exited a stolen vehicle. Tolan’s mother reiter- ated that she and her husband owned both the car Tolan had been driving and the home where these events were unfolding. Cotton then ordered her to stand against the family’s garage door. In response to Cotton’s order, Tolan’s mother asked, “[A]re you kidding me? We’ve lived her[e] years. We’ve never had anything like this happen before.”Id.,at ; see alsoid.,at .The parties disagree as to what happened next. Tolan’s mother and Cooper testified during Cotton’s criminal trial[1] that Cotton grabbed her arm and slammed her against the garage door with such force that she fell to the ground.Id.,at , –. Tolan similarly testified that Cotton pushed his mother against the garage door.Id.,at . In addition, Tolan offered testimony from his mother and photographic evidence to demonstrate that Cotton used enough force to leave bruises on her arms and back that lasted for days.Id.,at –, –. By contrast, Cotton testified in his deposition that when he was escorting the mother to the garage, she flipped her arm up and told him to get his hands off her.Id.,at . He also testified that he did not know whether he left bruises but believed that he had not.Id.,at .The parties also dispute the manner in which Tolan responded. Tolan testified in his deposition and during the criminal trial that upon seeing his mother being pushed,id.,at , he rose to his knees,id.,at . Edwards and Cotton testified that Tolan rose to his feet.Id.,at –, .Both parties agree that Tolan then exclaimed, from roughly to feet away, F. 3d, at , “[G]et your fucking hands off my mom.” Record . The parties also agree that Cotton then drew his pistol and fired three shots at Tolan. Tolan and his mother testified that these shots came with no verbal warning.Id.,at , . One of the bullets entered Tolan’s chest, collapsing his right lung and piercing his liver. While Tolan survived, he suffered a life-altering injury that disrupted his budding professional baseball career and causes him to experience pain on a daily basis.BIn May , Cooper, Tolan, and Tolan’s parents filed this suit in the Southern District of Texas, alleging claims under Rev. Stat. §, U. S. C. §. Tolan claimed, among other things, that Cotton had used excessive force against him in violation of the Fourth Amendment.[2] After discovery, Cotton moved for summary judgment, arguing that the doctrine of qualified immunity barred the suit. That doctrine immunizes government officials from damages suits unless their conduct has violated a clearly established right.The District Court granted summary judgment to Cotton. F. Supp. 2d (SD Tex. ). It reasoned that Cotton’s use of force was not unreasonable and therefore did not violate the Fourth Amendment.Id.,at –. The Fifth Circuit affirmed, but on a different basis. F.3d . It declined to decide whether Cotton’s actions violated the Fourth Amendment. Instead, it held that even if Cotton’s conduct did violate the Fourth Amendment, Cotton was entitled to qualified immunity because he did not violate a clearly established right.Id.,at .In reaching this conclusion, the Fifth Circuit began by noting that at the time Cotton shot Tolan, “it was . . . clearly established that an officer had the right to use deadly force if that officer harbored an objective and reasonable belief that a suspect presented an ‘immediate threat to [his] safety.’ ”Id.,at (quotingDevillev.Marcantel, F.3d , ( )). The Court of Appeals reasoned that Tolan failed to overcome the qualified-immunity bar because “an objectively-reasonable officer in Sergeant Cotton’s position could have . . . believed” that Tolan “presented an ‘immediate threat to the safety of the officers.’ ” F. 3d, at .[3] In support of this conclusion, the court relied on the following facts: the front porch had been “dimly-lit”; Tolan’s mother had “refus[ed] orders to remain quiet and calm”; and Tolan’s words had amounted to a “verba[l] threa[t].”Ibid. Most critically, the court also relied on the purported fact that Tolan was “moving to intervene in” Cotton’s handling of his mother,id.,at , and that Cotton therefore could reasonably have feared for his life,id.,at . Accord- ingly, the court held, Cotton did not violate clearly established law in shooting Tolan.The Fifth Circuit denied rehearing en banc. Fed. Appx. (). Three judges voted to grant rehearing. Judge Dennis filed a dissent, contending that the panel opinion “fail[ed] to address evidence that, when viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, creates genuine issues of material fact as to whether an objective officer in Cotton’s position could have reasonably and objectively believed that [Tolan] posed an immediate, significant threat of substantial injury to him.”Id.,at .IIAIn resolving questions of qualified immunity at summary judgment, courts engage in a two-pronged inquiry. The first asks whether the facts, “[t]aken in the light most favorable to the party asserting the injury, . . . show the officer’s conduct violated a [federal] right[.]”Saucierv.Katz, U.S. , (). When a plaintiff alleges excessive force during an investigation or arrest, the federal right at issue is the Fourth Amendment right against unreasonable seizures.Grahamv.Connor, U.S. , (). The inquiry into whether this right was violated requires a balancing of “ ‘the nature and quality of the intrusion on the individual’s Fourth Amendment interests against the importance of the governmental interests alleged to justify the intrusion.’ ”Tennesseev.Garner, U.S. 1, 8 (); seeGraham,supra, at .The second prong of the qualified-immunity analysis asks whether the right in question was “clearly established” at the time of the violation.Hopev.Pelzer, U.S. , (). Governmental actors are “shielded from liability for civil damages if their actions did not violate ‘clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.’ ”Ibid.“[T]he salient question . . . is whether the state of the law” at the time of an incident provided “fair warning” to the defendants “that their alleged [conduct] was unconstitutional.”Id.,at .Courts have discretion to decide the order in which to engage these two prongs.Pearsonv.Callahan, U.S. , (). But under either prong, courts may not resolve genuine disputes of fact in favor of the party seeking summary judgment. SeeBrosseauv.Haugen, U.S. , , n. 2 () (per curiam);Saucier,supra, at ;Hope,supra, at , n. 1. This is not a rule specific to qualified immunity; it is simply an application of the more general rule that a “judge’s function” at summary judgment is not “to weigh the evidence and determine the truth of the matter but to determine whether there is a genuine issue for trial.”Anderson, U. S., at . Summary judgment is appropriate only if “the movant shows that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. (a). In making that determination, a court must view the evidence “in the light most favorable to the opposing party.”Adickesv.S. H. Kress & Co., U.S. , (); see alsoAnderson,supra, at .Our qualified-immunity cases illustrate the importance of drawing inferences in favor of the nonmovant, even when, as here, a court decides only the clearly-established prong of the standard. In cases alleging unreasonable searches or seizures, we have instructed that courts should define the “clearly established” right at issue on the basis of the “specific context of the case.”Saucier,supra, at ; see alsoAndersonv.Creighton, U.S. , – (). Accordingly, courts must take care not to define a case’s “context” in a manner that imports genuinely disputed factual propositions. SeeBrosseau,supra, at , (inquiring as to whether conduct violated clearly established law “ ‘in light of the specific context of the case’ ” and construing “facts . . . in a light most favorable to” the nonmovant).BIn holding that Cotton’s actions did not violate clearly established law, the Fifth Circuit failed to view the evidence at summary judgment in the light most favorable to Tolan with respect to the central facts of this case. By failing to credit evidence that contradicted some of its key factual conclusions, the court improperly “weigh[ed] the evidence” and resolved disputed issues in favor of the moving party,Anderson, U. S., at .First, the court relied on its view that at the time of the shooting, the Tolans’ front porch was “dimly-lit.” F. 3d, at . The court appears to have drawn this assessment from Cotton’s statements in a deposition that when he fired at Tolan, the porch was “ ‘fairly dark,’ ” and lit by a gas lamp that was “ ‘decorative.’ ”Id.,at . In his own deposition, however, Tolan’s father was asked whether the gas lamp was in fact “more decorative than illuminating.” Record . He said that it was not.Ibid.Moreover, Tolan stated in his deposition that two floodlights shone on the driveway during the incident,id.,at , and Cotton acknowledged that there were two motion-activated lights in front of the house.Id.,at . And Tolan confirmed that at the time of the shooting, he was “not in darkness.”Id.,at –.Second, the Fifth Circuit stated that Tolan’s mother “refus[ed] orders to remain quiet and calm,” thereby “compound[ing]” Cotton’s belief that Tolan “presented an immediate threat to the safety of the officers.” F. 3d, at (internal quotation marks omitted). But here, too, the court did not credit directly contradictory evidence. Al- though the parties agree that Tolan’s mother repeatedly informed officers that Tolan was her son, that she lived in the home in front of which he had parked, and that the vehicle he had been driving belonged to her and her husband, there is a dispute as to how calmly she provided this information. Cotton stated during his deposition that Tolan’s mother was “very agitated” when she spoke to the officers. Record –. By contrast, Tolan’s mother testified at Cotton’s criminal trial that she was neither “aggravated” nor “agitated.”Id.,at , .Third, the Court concluded that Tolan was “shouting,” F. 3d, at , , and “verbally threatening” the officer,id.,at , in the moments before the shooting. The court noted, and the parties agree, that while Cotton was grabbing the arm of his mother, Tolan told Cotton, “[G]et your fucking hands off my mom.” Record . But Tolan testified that he “was not screaming.”Id.,at . And a jury could reasonably infer that his words, in context, did not amount to a statement of intent to inflict harm. Cf.UnitedStatesv.White, F.3d , ( ) (“A threat imports ‘[a] communicated intent to inflict physical or other harm’ ” (quoting Black’s Law Dictionary (6th ed. )));Morrisv.Noe, F.3d , ( ) (inferring that the words “Why was you talking to Mama that way” did not constitute an “overt threa[t]”). Tolan’s mother testified in Cotton’s criminal trial that he slammed her against a garage door with enough force to cause bruising that lasted for days. Record –. A jury could well have concluded that a reasonable officer would have heard Tolan’s words not as a threat, but as a son’s plea not to continue any assault of his mother.Fourth, the Fifth Circuit inferred that at the time of the shooting, Tolan was “moving to intervene in Sergeant Cotton’s” interaction with his mother. F. 3d, at ; see alsoid.,at (characterizing Tolan’s behavior as “abruptly attempting to approach Sergeant Cotton,” thereby “inflam[ing] an already tense situation”). The court appears to have credited Edwards’ account that at the time of the shooting, Tolan was on both feet “[i]n a crouch” or a “charging position” looking as if he was going to move forward. Record –. Tolan testified at trial, however, that he was on his knees when Cotton shot him,id.,at , a fact corroborated by his mother,id.,at . Tolan also testified in his deposition that he “wasn’t going anywhere,”id.,at , and emphasized that he did not “jump up,”id.,at .Considered together, these facts lead to the inescapable conclusion that the court below credited the evidence of the party seeking summary judgment and failed properly to acknowledge key evidence offered by the party opposing that motion. And while “this Court is not equipped to correct every perceived error coming from the lower federal courts,”Boagv. U.S. , () (O’Connor, J., concurring), we intervene here because the opinion below reflects a clear misapprehension of summary judgment standards in light of our precedents. Cf.Brosseau, U. S., at – (summarily reversing decision in a Fourth Amendment excessive force case “to correct a clear misapprehension of the qualified immunity standard”); see alsoFlorida Dept. of Health and Rehabilitative Servs.v.Florida Nursing Home Assn., U.S. , () (per curiam) (summarily reversing an opinion that could not “be reconciled with the principles set out” in this Court’s sovereign immunity jurisprudence).The witnesses on both sides come to this case with their own perceptions, recollections, and even potential biases. It is in part for that reason that genuine disputes are generally resolved by juries in our adversarial system. By weighing the evidence and reaching factual inferences contrary to Tolan’s competent evidence, the court below neglected to adhere to the fundamental principle that at the summary judgment stage, reasonable inferences should be drawn in favor of the nonmoving party.Applying that principle here, the court should have acknowledged and credited Tolan’s evidence with regard to the lighting, his mother’s demeanor, whether he shouted words that were an overt threat, and his positioning during the shooting. This is not to say, of course, that these are the only facts that the Fifth Circuit should consider, or that no other facts might contribute to the reasonableness of the officer’s actions as a matter of law. Nor do we express a view as to whether Cotton’s actions vio- lated clearly established law. We instead vacate the Fifth Circuit’s judgment so that the court can determine whether, when Tolan’s evidence is properly credited and factual inferences are reasonably drawn in his favor, Cotton’s actions violated clearly established law.* * *The petition for certiorari and the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund’s motion to file anamicus curiaebrief are granted. The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.Notes1The events described here led to Cotton’s criminal indictment in Harris County, Texas, for aggravated assault by a public servant. F.3d , ( ). He was acquitted.Ibid.The testimony of Tolan’s mother during Cotton’s trial is a part of the record in this civil action. Record –.2The complaint also alleged that the officers’ actions violated the Equal Protection Clause to the extent they were motivated by Tolan’s and Cooper’s race. F. Supp. 2d , (SD Tex. ). In addition, the complaint alleged that Cotton used excessive force against Tolan’s mother.Id.,at . Those claims, which were dismissed,id.,at , , are not before this Court.3Tolan argues that the Fifth Circuit incorrectly analyzed the reasonableness of Sergeant Cotton’s beliefs under the second prong of the qualified-immunity analysis rather than the first. See Pet. for Cert. , . Because we rule in Tolan’s favor on the narrow ground that the Fifth Circuit erred in its application of the summary judgment standard, we express no view as to Tolan’s additional argument."}
{"file_name": "per curiam_2010_932_564.json", "author": "per curiam", "year": 2010, "text": "– Decided June 7, 2010Per Curiam.In , respondent was charged in the United States District Court for the District of Montana with juvenile delinquency under the Federal Juvenile Delinquency Act (FJDA), U. S. C. §5031et seq. Respondent eventually pleaded “true” to knowingly engaging in sexual acts with a person under years of age, which would have been a crime under §§(c) and (a) if committed by an adult. In June , the District Court accepted respondent’s plea and adjudged him delinquent. The court sentenced respondent to two years’ official detention and juvenile delinquent supervision until his 21st birthday. The court also ordered respondent to spend the first six months of his juvenile supervision in a prerelease center and to abide by the center’s conditions of residency.In , Congress enacted the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA), Stat. , U. S. C. §16901et seq. With respect to juvenile offenders, SORNA requires individuals who have been adjudicated delinquent for certain serious sex offenses to register and to keep their registrations current in each jurisdiction where they live, work, and go to school. §§(8); . In February , the Attorney General issued an interim rule specifying that SORNA’s requirements “apply to all sex offenders, including sex offenders convicted of the offense for which registration is required prior to the enactment of [SORNA].” Fed. Reg. (codified at CFR §.3 ()).In July , the District Court revoked respondent’s juvenile supervision, finding that respondent had failed to comply with the requirements of the prerelease program. The court sentenced respondent to an additional 6-month term of official detention, to be followed by a period of supervision until his 21st birthday. The Government, invoking SORNA’s juvenile registration provisions, argued that respondent should be required to register as a sex offender, at least for the duration of his juvenile supervision. As “special conditions” of his supervision, the court ordered respondent to register as a sex offender and to keep his registration current. App. to Pet. for Cert. 39a.The Ninth Circuit vacated the sex-offender-registration requirements of the District Court’s order. F. 3d (). The Court of Appeals determined that “retroactive application of SORNA’s provision covering individuals who were adjudicated juvenile delinquents because of the commission of certain sex offenses before SORNA’s passage violates the Ex Post Facto Clause of the United States Constitution.”Id., at . The court thus held that “SORNA’s juvenile registration provision may not be applied retroactively to individuals adjudicated delinquent under the [FJDA].”Id., at .The United States asks us to grant certiorari to review the Ninth Circuit’s determination that SORNA violates theEx Post FactoClause as applied to individuals who were adjudicated juvenile delinquents under the FJDA prior to SORNA’s enactment. Before we can address that question, however, we must resolve a threshold issue of mootness. Before the Ninth Circuit, respondent challenged only the conditions of his juvenile supervision requiring him to register as a sex offender. But on May 2, , respondent’s term of supervision expired, and thus he no longer is subject to those sex-offender-registration conditions. As such, this case likely is moot unless respondent can show that a decision invalidating the sex-offender-registration conditions of his juvenile supervision would be sufficiently likely to redress “collateral consequences adequate to meet Article III’s injury-in-fact requirement.”Spencerv.Kemna, U. S. 1, ().Perhaps the most likely potential “collateral consequenc[e]” that might be remedied by a judgment in respondent’s favor is the requirement that respondent remain registered as a sex offender under Montana law. (“By the time of the court of appeals’ decision, respondent had become registered as a sex offender in Montana, where he continues to be registered today.” Pet. for Cert. .) We thus must know whether a favorable decision in this case would make it sufficiently likely that respondent “could remove his name and identifying information from the Montana sex offender registry.”Ibid. Therefore, we certify the following question to the Supreme Court of Montana, pursuant to Montana Rule of Appellate Procedure ():Is respondent’s duty to remain registered as a sex offender under Montana law contingent upon the validity of the conditions of his now-expired federal juvenile-supervision order that required him to register as a sex offender, see Mont. Code Ann. §§––(6)(b), –5–(1)(c) ();Statev.Villanueva, Mont. , –, P. 3d , – (); see also §––(9)(b) (), or is the duty an independent requirement of Montana law that is unaffected by the validity or invalidity of the federal juvenile-supervision conditions, see §––() (); Mont. Laws ch. , §, p. ?We respectfully request that the Montana Supreme Court accept our certified question. The court’s answer to this question will help determine whether this case presents a live case or controversy, and there is no controlling appellate decision, constitutional provision, or statute on point. Mont. Rule App. Proc. (3). We understand that the Montana Supreme Court may wish to reformulate the certified question. Rule (6)(a)(iii).The Clerk of this Court is directed to transmit to the Supreme Court of Montana a copy of this opinion, the briefs filed in this Court in this case, and a list of the counsel appearing in this matter along with their names and addresses. See Rules (5) and (6)(a)(iv). Further proceedings in this case are reserved pending our receipt of a response from the Supreme Court of Montana.It is so ordered."}

Decided November , 2009Per Curiam.In , in the course of a burglary, Fernando Belmontes bludgeoned Steacy McConnell to death, striking her in the head to times with a steel dumbbell bar. SeePeoplev.Belmontes, Cal. 3d , –, P.2d , – (). After the murder, Belmontes and his accomplices stole McConnell’s stereo, sold it for $, and used the money to buy beer and drugs for the night.Id., at –, P. 2d, at –.Belmontes was convicted of murder and sentenced to death in state court. Unsuccessful on direct appeal and state collateral review, Belmontes sought federal habeas relief, which the District Court denied. The Court of Appeals reversed, finding instructional error, but we overturned that decision.Ayersv.Belmontes, U. S. 7(); see alsoBrownv.Belmontes, U. S. (). On remand, the Court of Appeals again ruled for Belmontes, this time finding that Belmontes suffered ineffective assistance of counsel during the sentencing phase of his trial. The District Court had previously denied relief on that ground, finding that counsel for Belmontes had performed deficiently under Ninth Circuit precedent, but that Belmontes could not establish prejudice underStricklandv.Washington, U. S. ().Belmontesv.Calderon, Civ. S–– DFL JFM (ED Cal., Aug. , ), App. to Pet. for Cert. 140a, 179a, 183a. The Court of Appeals agreed that counsel’s performance was deficient, but disagreed with the District Court with respect to prejudice, determining that counsel’s errors undermined confidence in the penalty phase verdict.Belmontesv.Ayers, F. 3d , –, ( ). We disagree with the Court of Appeals as to prejudice, grant the State’s petition for certiorari, and reverse.IBelmontes argues that his counsel was constitutionally ineffective for failing to investigate and present sufficient mitigating evidence during the penalty phase of his trial. To prevail on this claim, Belmontes must meet both the deficient performance and prejudice prongs ofStrickland, U. S., at . To show deficient performance, Belmontes must establish that “counsel’s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.”Id., at . In light of “the variety of circumstances faced by defense counsel [and] the range of legitimate decisions regarding how best to represent a criminal defendant,” the performance inquiry necessarily turns on “whether counsel’s assistance was reasonable considering all the circumstances.”Id., at –. At all points, “[j]udicial scrutiny of counsel’s performance must be highly deferential.”Id., at .The challenge confronting Belmontes’ lawyer, John Schick, was very specific. Substantial evidence indicated that Belmontes had committed a prior murder, and the prosecution was eager to introduce that evidence during the penalty phase of the McConnell trial. The evidence of the prior murder was extensive, including eyewitness testimony, Belmontes’ own admissions, and Belmontes’ possession of the murder weapon and the same type of ammunition used to kill the victim. Record –, ; Deposition of John Schick, Exhs. , , (Sept. , ).The evidence, furthermore, was potentially devastating. It would have shown that two years before Steacy McConnell’s death, police found Jerry Howard’s body in a secluded area. Howard had been killed execution style, with a bullet to the back of the head. The authorities suspected Belmontes, but on the eve of trial the State’s witnesses refused to cooperate (Belmontes’ mother had begged one not to testify). The prosecution therefore believed it could not prove Belmontes guilty of murder beyond a reasonable doubt. What the prosecution could prove, even without the recalcitrant witnesses, was that Belmontes possessed the gun used to murder Howard. So the State offered, and Belmontes accepted, a no-contest plea to accessory after the fact to voluntary manslaughter. Record –; Deposition of John Schick, Exhs. , , .But Belmontes had not been shy about discussing the murder, boasting to several people that he had killed Howard. Steven Cartwright informed the district attorney that Belmontes had confessed to the murder. A police informant told detectives that Belmontes “bragged” about the murder, stating that he was “mad” at Howard because “the night before, he had quite a [lot] of dope and wouldn’t share it with him.” After double jeopardy protection set in and he had been released on parole, Belmontes admitted his responsibility for the murder to his counselor at the California Youth Authority, Charles Sapien. During his time in confinement, Belmontes had “always denied that he was the [one] who shot Jerry Howard.” But because Sapien “had been square with [Belmontes],” Belmontes decided to level with Sapien upon his release, telling Sapien that he had “ ‘wasted’ that guy.” Record ; Deposition of John Schick, Exhs. , , .Schick understood the gravity of this aggravating evidence, and he built his mitigation strategy around the overriding need to exclude it. California evidentiary rules, Schick knew, offered him an argument to exclude the evidence, but those same rules made clear that the evidence would come in for rebuttal if Schick opened the door. Record ; see alsoPeoplev.Rodriguez, Cal. 3d , –, P.2d , ();Peoplev.Harris, Cal. 3d , –, P. 2d , (). Schick thus had “grave concerns” that, even if he succeeded initially in excluding the prior murder evidence, it would still be admitted if his mitigation case swept too broadly. Accordingly, Schick decided to proceed cautiously, structuring his mitigation arguments and witnesses to limit that possibility. Deposition of John Schick , –; seeStrickland,supra, at (“Restricting testimony on respondent’s character to what had come in at the plea colloquy ensured that contrary character and psychological evidence and respondent’s criminal history, which counsel had successfully moved to exclude, would not come in”).As Schick expected, the prosecution was ready to admit this evidence during the sentencing phase. Schick moved to exclude the evidence, arguing that the State should be allowed to tell the jury only that Belmontes had been convicted of being an accessory after the fact to voluntary manslaughter—nothing more. Record –. Schick succeeded in keeping the prosecution from presenting the damaging evidence in its sentencing case in chief, but his client remained at risk: The trial court indicated the evidence would come in for rebuttal or impeachmentifSchick opened the door.Id., at .This was not an empty threat. In one instance, Schick elicited testimony that Belmontes was not a violent person. The State objected and, out of earshot of the jury, argued that it should be able to rebut the testimony with the Howard murder evidence.Id., at –. The Court warned Schick that it was “going to have to allow [the prosecution] to go into the whole background” if Schick continued his line of questioning.Id., at . Schick acquiesced, and the court struck the testimony.Ibid.The Court’s warning reinforced Schick’s understanding that he would have to tailor his mitigation case carefully to preserve his success in excluding the Howard murder evidence. With that cautionary note in mind, Schick put on nine witnesses he thought could advance a case for mitigation, without opening the door to the prior murder evidence. Seeid., at –.The Court of Appeals determined that in spite of these efforts, Schick’s performance was constitutionally deficient under Circuit precedent.Belmontes, F. 3d, at –. The State challenges that conclusion, but we need not resolve the point, because we agree with the District Court that Belmontes cannot establish prejudice.IITo establish prejudice, Belmontes must show “a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.”Strickland, U. S., at . That showing requires Belmontes to establish “a reasonable probability that a competent attorney, aware of [the available mitigating evidence], would have introduced it at sentencing,” and “that had the jury been confronted with this ... mitigating evidence, there is a reasonable probability that it would have returned with a different sentence.”Wigginsv.Smith, U. S. , , ().The Ninth Circuit determined that a reasonably competent lawyer would have introduced more mitigation evidence, on top of what Schick had already presented. For purposes of our prejudice analysis, we accept that conclusion and proceed to consider whether there is a reasonable probability that a jury presented with this additional mitigation evidence would have returned a different verdict.In evaluating that question, it is necessary to considerallthe relevant evidence that the jury would have had before it if Schick had pursued the different path—not just the mitigation evidence Schick could have presented, but also the Howard murder evidence that almost certainly would have come in with it. SeeStrickland,supra, at –, . Thus, to establish prejudice, Belmontes must show a reasonable probability that the jury would have rejected a capital sentence after it weighed the entire body of mitigating evidence (including the additional testimony Schick could have presented) against the entire body of aggravating evidence (including the Howard murder evidence). Belmontes cannot meet this burden.We begin with the mitigating evidence Schick did present during the sentencing phase. That evidence was substantial. The same Ninth Circuit panel addressing the same record in Belmontes’ first habeas appeal agreed, recognizing “the substantial nature of the mitigating evidence” Schick presented.Belmontesv.Woodford, F. 3d , (). It reiterated the point several times. Seeid., at , , .All told, Schick put nine witnesses on the stand over a span of two days, and elicited a range of testimony on Belmontes’ behalf. A number of those witnesses highlighted Belmontes’ “terrible” childhood. They testified that his father was an alcoholic and extremely abusive. Belmontes’ grandfather described the one-bedroom house where Belmontes spent much of his childhood as a “chicken coop.” Belmontes did not do well in school; he dropped out in the ninth grade. His younger sister died when she was only months old. And his grandmother died tragically when she drowned in her swimming pool. See Record –, –, .Family members also testified that, despite these difficulties, Belmontes maintained strong relationships with his grandfather, grandmother, mother, and sister.Id., at –, –. And Belmontes’ best friend offered the insights of a close friend and confidant.Id., at –.Schick also called witnesses who detailed Belmontes’ religious conversion while in state custody on the accessory charge. These witnesses told stories about Belmontes’ efforts advising other inmates in his detention center’s religious program, to illustrate that he could live a productive and meaningful life in prison. They described his success working as part of a firefighting crew, detailing his rise from lowest man on the team to second in command. Belmontes’ assistant chaplain even said that he would use Belmontes as a regular part of his prison counseling program if the jury handed down a life sentence.Id., at –, –, –.Belmontes himself bolstered these accounts by testifying about his childhood and religious conversion, both at sentencing and during allocution. Belmontes described his childhood as “pretty hard,” but took responsibility for his actions, telling the jury that he did not want to use his background “as a crutch[,] to say I am in a situation now ... because of that.”Id., at .On remand from this Court, the Court of Appeals—addressing Belmontes’ ineffective assistance claim for the first time—changed its view of this evidence. Instead of finding Schick’s mitigation case “substantial,” as it previously had,Belmontes, F. 3d, at , the Ninth Circuit this time around labeled it “cursory,”Belmontes, F. 3d, at , , n. , . Compare alsoBelmontes, F. 3d, at , , (labeling the mitigation evidence Schick presented “substantial”), withBelmontes, F. 3d, at , n. 3, (labeling the same evidence “insubstantial”). More evidence, the Court of Appeals now concluded, would have made a difference; in particular, more evidence to “humanize” Belmontes, as that court put it no fewer than times in its opinion.Belmontes, F. 3d, at , , , , , , , and n. , , , . The Court determined that the failure to put on this evidence prejudiced Belmontes.There are two problems with this conclusion: Some of the evidence was merely cumulative of the humanizing evidence Schick actually presented; adding it to what was already there would have made little difference. Other evidence proposed by the Ninth Circuit would have put into play aspects of Belmontes’ character that would have triggered admission of the powerful Howard evidence in rebuttal. This evidence would have made a difference, but in the wrong direction for Belmontes. In either event, Belmontes cannot establishStricklandprejudice.First, the cumulative evidence. In the Court of Appeals’ view, Belmontes should have presented more humanizing evidence about Belmontes’ “difficult childhood” and highlighted his “positive attributes.” F. 3d, at . As for his difficult childhood, Schick should have called witnesses to testify that “when Belmontes was five years old, his -month-old sister died of a brain tumor,” that he “exhibited symptoms of depression” after her death, that his grandmother suffered from “alcoholism and prescription drug addiction,” and that both his immediate and extended family lived in a state of “constant strife.”Ibid. As for his positive attributes, Schick should have produced testimony about Belmontes’ “strong character as a child in the face of adversity.”Ibid.Schick should have illustrated that Belmontes was “kind, responsible, and likeable”; that he “got along well with his siblings” and was “respectful towards his grandparents despite their disapproval of his mixed racial background”; and that he “participated in community activities, kept up in school and got along with his teachers before [an] illness, and made friends easily.”Ibid.But as recounted above and recognized by the state courts and, originally, this very panel, Schickdidput on substantial mitigation evidence, much of it targeting the same “humanizing” theme the Ninth Circuit highlighted. Compare,e.g.,ibid., with Record (death of -month-old sister);id., at , (difficult childhood);id., at – (family member’s addictions);id., at –, – (family strife and abuse);id., at , , –, (strong character as a child);id., at – (close relationship with siblings);id., at – (close relationship with grandparents);id., at – (participation in community religious events); see also,e.g., Belmontes’ Traverse to Respondent’s Return to Pet. for Writ of Habeas Corpus in No. 5–––EJG–JFM (ED Cal.), p. (“[C]ounsel’s presentation was arguably adequate only with respect to [evidence] of ‘humanizing’ petitioner”). The sentencing jury was thus “well acquainted” with Belmontes’ background and potential humanizing features.Schrirov.Landrigan, U. S. , (). Additional evidence on these points would have offered an insignificant benefit, if any at all.The Ninth Circuit also determined that both the evidence Schick presented and the additional evidence it proposed would have carried greater weight if Schick had submitted expert testimony. Such testimony could “make connections between the various themes in the mitigation case and explain to the jury how they could have contributed to Belmontes’s involvement in criminal activity.”Belmontes, F. 3d, at . See alsoibid. (discussing expert’s federal habeas testimony on importance of expert testimony). But the body of mitigating evidence the Ninth Circuit would have required Schick to present was neither complex nor technical. It required only that the jury make logical connections of the kind a layperson is well equipped to make. The jury simply did not need expert testimony to understand the “humanizing” evidence; it could use its common sense or own sense of mercy.What is more, expert testimony discussing Belmontes’ mental state, seeking to explain his behavior, or putting it in some favorable context would have exposed Belmontes to the Howard evidence. SeeDardenv.Wainwright, U. S. , () (“Any attempt to portray petitioner as a nonviolent man would have opened the door for the State to rebut with evidence of petitioner’s prior convictions... . Similarly, if defense counsel had attempted to put on evidence that petitioner was a family man, they would have been faced with his admission at trial that, although still married, he was spending the weekend furlough with a girlfriend”).If, for example, an expert had testified that Belmontes had a “ ‘high likelihood of a ... nonviolent adjustment to a prison setting,’ ” as Belmontes suggested an expert might, see Brief for Appellant in No. – (), p. , the question would have immediately arisen: “What was his propensity toward violence to begin with? Does evidence of another murder alter your view?” Expert testimony explainingwhythe jury should feel sympathy, as opposed simply to facts that might elicit that response, would have led to a similar rejoinder: “Is such sympathy equally appropriate for someone who committed a second murder?” Any of this testimony from an expert’s perspective would have made the Howard evidence fair game.Many of Belmontes’ other arguments fail for the same reason. He argues that the jury should have been told that he suffered an “extended bout with rheumatic fever,” which led to “emotional instability, impulsivity, and impairment of the neurophysiological mechanisms for planning and reasoning.” Amended Pet. for Writ of Habeas Corpus . But the cold, calculated nature of the Howard murder and Belmontes’ subsequent bragging about it would have served as a powerful counterpoint.The type of “more-evidence-is-better” approach advocated by Belmontes and the Court of Appeals might seem appealing—after all, what is there to lose? But here there was a lot to lose. A heavyhanded case to portray Belmontes in a positive light, with or without experts, would have invited the strongest possible evidence in rebuttal—the evidence that Belmontes was responsible for not one but two murders.Belmontes counters that some of the potential mitigating evidence might not have opened the door to the prior murder evidence. The Court of Appeals went so far as to state, without citation, that “[t]here would be no basis for suggesting that [expert testimony] would be any different if the expert were informed that Belmontes committed two murders rather than one.”Belmontes, F. 3d, at , n. . But it is surely pertinent in assessing expert testimony “explain[ing] ... involvement in criminal activity,”id., at , to know what criminal activity was at issue. And even if the number of murders were as irrelevant as the Ninth Circuit asserted, the fact thatthesetwo murders were so different in character made each of them highly pertinent in evaluating expert testimony of the sort envisioned by the Court of Appeals.The Ninth Circuit noted that the trial court retained discretion to exclude the Howard evidence even if Schick opened the door.Id., at –, n. . If Schick had doubts, the Court of Appeals contended, he could have secured an answer in advance through a motionin limine.Ibid. The trial judge, however, left little doubt where he stood. While ruling that the prosecution could not present the evidence in its case in chief, Record , the judge made clear that it would come in for certain rebuttal purposes,id., at , –. When Schick elicited testimony that Belmontes was not violent, for example, the judge ordered it stricken and warned Schick that he would admit the Howard murder evidence—to let the prosecution “go into the whole background”—if Schick pressed forward.Id., at .In balancing the mitigating factors against the aggravators, the Court of Appeals repeatedly referred to the aggravating evidence the State presented as “scant.”Belmontes, F. 3d, at , , , , . That characterization missesStrickland’s point that the reviewing court must consider all the evidence—the good and the bad—when evaluating prejudice. SeeStrickland, U. S., at –, . Here, the worst kind of bad evidence would have come in with the good. The only reason it did not was because Schick was careful in his mitigation case. The State’s aggravation evidence could only be characterized as “scant” if one ignores the “elephant in the courtroom”—Belmontes’ role in the Howard murder—that would have been presented had Schick submitted the additional mitigation evidence.Belmontesv.Ayers, F. 3d , ( ) (Callahan, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc).Even on the record before it—which did not include the Howard murder—the state court determined that Belmontes “was convicted on extremely strong evidence that he committed an intentional murder of extraordinary brutality.”Belmontes, Cal. 3d, at , P. 2d, at . That court also noted that “[t]he properly admitted aggravating evidence in this case—in particular, the circumstances of the crime—was simply overwhelming.”Id., at , P. 2d, at (citation omitted). The Ninth Circuit saw the murder differently. It viewed the circumstances of the crime as only “conceivably significant” as an aggravating factor.Belmontes, F. 3d, at . In particular, the Court of Appeals concluded that “[t]he crime here did not involve ... needless suffering on the part of the victim.”Ibid.We agree with the state court’s characterization of the murder, and simply cannot comprehend the assertion by the Court of Appeals that this case did not involve “needless suffering.” The jury saw autopsy photographs showing Steacy McConnell’s mangled head, her skull crushed by to blows from a steel dumbbell bar the jury found to have been wielded by Belmontes. McConnell’s corpse showed numerous “defensive bruises and contusions on [her] hands, arms, and feet,”id., at , which “plainly evidenced a desperate struggle for life at [Belmontes’] hands,”Belmontes, P. 2d, at . Belmontes left McConnell to die, but officers found her still fighting for her life before ultimately succumbing to the injuries caused by the blows from Belmontes. Record 3. The jury also heard that this savage murder was committed solely to prevent interference with a burglary that netted Belmontes $ he used to buy beer and drugs for the night. McConnell suffered, and it was clearly needless.Some of the error below may be traced to confusion about the appropriate standard and burden of proof. While the Court of Appeals quoted the pertinent language fromStrickland, that court elsewhere suggested it might have applied something different. In explaining its prejudice determination, the Ninth Circuit concluded that “[t]he aggravating evidence, even with the addition of evidence that Belmontes murdered Howard, is not strong enough, in light of the mitigating evidence that could have been adduced, to rule out a sentence of life in prison.”Belmontes, F. 3d, at . ButStricklanddoes not require the State to “rule out” a sentence of life in prison to prevail. Rather,Stricklandplaces the burden on the defendant, not the State, to show a “reasonable probability” that the result would have been different. U. S., at . Under a proper application of theStricklandstandard, Belmontes cannot carry this burden.It is hard to imagine expert testimony andadditionalfacts about Belmontes’ difficult childhood outweighing the facts of McConnell’s murder. It becomes even harder to envision such a result when the evidence that Belmontes had committed another murder—“the most powerful imaginable aggravating evidence,” as Judge Levi put it,Belmontes, S-–, App. to Pet. for Cert. 183a—is added to the mix. Schick’s mitigation strategy failed, but the notion that the result could have been different if only Schick had put on more than the nine witnesses he did, or called expert witnesses to bolster his case, is fanciful.The petition for certiorari and the motion for leave to proceedin forma pauperisare granted. The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered."}
{"file_name": "per curiam_2016_464_577.json", "author": "per curiam", "year": 2016, "text": "– Decided March 7, 2016Per Curiam.A Georgia court entered a final judgment of adoption making petitioner V. L. a legal parent of the children that she and respondent E. L. had raised together from birth. V. L. and E. L. later separated while living in Alabama. V. L. asked the Alabama courts to enforce the Georgia judgment and grant her custody or visitation rights. The Alabama Supreme Court ruled against her, holding that the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the United States Constitution does not require the Alabama courts to respect the Georgia judgment. That judgment of the Alabama Supreme Court is now reversed by this summary disposition.IV. L. and E. L. are two women who were in a relationship from approximately until . Through assisted reproductive technology, E. L. gave birth to a child named S. L. in and to twins named N. L. and H. L. in . After the children were born, V. L. and E. L. raised them together as joint parents.V. L. and E. L. eventually decided to give legal status to the relationship between V. L. and the children by having V. L. formally adopt them. To facilitate the adoption, the couple rented a house in Alpharetta, Georgia. V. L. then filed an adoption petition in the Superior Court of Fulton County, Georgia. E. L. also appeared in that proceeding. While not relinquishing her own parental rights, she gave her express consent to V. L.’s adoption of the children as a second parent. The Georgia court determined that V. L. had complied with the applicable requirements of Georgia law, and entered a final decree of adoption allowing V. L. to adopt the children and recognizing both V. L. and E. L. as their legal parents.V. L. and E. L. ended their relationship in , while living in Alabama, and V. L. moved out of the house that the couple had shared. V. L. later filed a petition in the Circuit Court of Jefferson County, Alabama, alleging that E. L. had denied her access to the children and interfered with her ability to exercise her parental rights. She asked the Alabama court to register the Georgia adoption judgment and award her some measure of custody or visitation rights. The matter was transferred to the Family Court of Jefferson County. That court entered an order awarding V. L. scheduled visitation with the children.E. L. appealed the visitation order to the Alabama Court of Civil Appeals. She argued, among other points, that the Alabama courts should not recognize the Georgia judgment because the Georgia court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction to enter it. The Court of Civil Appeals rejected that argument. It held, however, that the Alabama family court had erred by failing to conduct an evidentiary hearing before awarding V. L. visitation rights, and so it remanded for the family court to conduct that hearing.The Alabama Supreme Court reversed. It held that the Georgia court had no subject-matter jurisdiction under Georgia law to enter a judgment allowing V. L. to adopt the children while still recognizing E. L.’s parental rights. As a consequence, the Alabama Supreme Court held Alabama courts were not required to accord full faith and credit to the Georgia judgment.IIThe Constitution provides that “Full Faith and Credit shall be given in each State to the public Acts, Records, and judicial Proceedings of every other State.” U. S. Const., Art. IV, §1. That Clause requires each State to recognize and give effect to valid judgments rendered by the courts of its sister States. It serves “to alter the status of the several states as independent foreign sovereignties, each free to ignore obligations created under the laws or by the judicial proceedings of the others, and to make them integral parts of a single nation.”Milwaukee Countyv.M. E. White Co., U. S. , ().With respect to judgments, “the full faith and credit obligation is exacting.”Bakerv.General Motors Corp., U. S. , (). “A final judgment in one State, if rendered by a court with adjudicatory authority over the subject matter and persons governed by the judgment, qualifies for recognition throughout the land.”Ibid.A State may not disregard the judgment of a sister State because it disagrees with the reasoning underlying the judgment or deems it to be wrong on the merits. On the contrary, “the full faith and credit clause of the Constitution precludes any inquiry into the merits of the cause of action, the logic or consistency of the decision, or the validity of the legal principles on which the judgment is based.”Millikenv.Meyer, U. S. , ().A State is not required, however, to afford full faith and credit to a judgment rendered by a court that “did not have jurisdiction over the subject matter or the relevant parties.”Underwriters Nat. Assurance Co.v.North Carolina Life & Accident & Health Ins. Guaranty Assn., U. S. , (). “Consequently, before a court is bound by [a] judgment rendered in another State, it may inquire into the jurisdictional basis of the foreign court’s decree.”Ibid.That jurisdictional inquiry, however, is a limited one. “[I]f the judgment on its face appears to be a ‘record of a court of general jurisdiction, such jurisdiction over the cause and the parties is to be presumed unless disproved by extrinsic evidence, or by the record itself.’ ”Milliken,supra, at (quotingAdamv.Saenger, U. S. , ()).Those principles resolve this case. Under Georgia law, as relevant here, “[t]he superior courts of the several counties shall have exclusive jurisdiction in all matters of adoption.” Ga. Code Ann. §–8–2(a) (). That provision on its face gave the Georgia Superior Court subject-matter jurisdiction to hear and decide the adoption petition at issue here. The Superior Court resolved that matter by entering a final judgment that made V. L. the legal adoptive parent of the children. Whatever the merits of that judgment, it was within the statutory grant of jurisdiction over “all matters of adoption.”Ibid.The Georgia court thus had the “adjudicatory authority over the subject matter” required to entitle its judgment to full faith and credit.Baker,supra, at .The Alabama Supreme Court reached a different result by relying on Ga. Code Ann. §–8–5(a). That statute states (as relevant here) that “a child who has any living parent or guardian may be adopted by a third party . . . only if each such living parent and each such guardian has voluntarily and in writing surrendered all of his or her rights to such child.” The Alabama Supreme Court concluded that this provision prohibited the Georgia Superior Court from allowing V. L. to adopt the children while also allowing E. L. to keep her existing parental rights. It further concluded that this provision went not to the merits but to the Georgia court’s subject-matter jurisdiction. In reaching that crucial second conclusion, the Alabama Supreme Court seems to have relied solely on the fact that the right to adoption under Georgia law is purely statutory, and “ ‘[t]he requirements of Georgia’s adoptions statutes are mandatory and must be strictly construed in favor of the natural parents.’ ” App. to Pet. for Cert. 23a–24a (quotingIn re Marks, Ga. App. , , S. E. 2d , ()).That analysis is not consistent with this Court’s controlling precedent. Where a judgment indicates on its face that it was rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction, such jurisdiction “ ‘is to be presumed unless disproved.’ ”Milliken,supra, at (quotingAdam,supra, at ). There is nothing here to rebut that presumption. The Georgia statute on which the Alabama Supreme Court relied, Ga. Code Ann. §–8–5(a), does not speak in jurisdictional terms; for instance, it does not say that a Georgia court “shall have jurisdiction to enter an adoption decree” only if each existing parent or guardian has surrendered his or her parental rights. Neither the Georgia Supreme Court nor any Georgia appellate court, moreover, has construed §–8–5(a) as jurisdictional. That construction would also be difficult to reconcile with Georgia law. Georgia recognizes that in general, subject-matter jurisdiction addresses “whether a court has jurisdiction to decide a particular class of cases,”Goodrumv.Goodrum, Ga. , S. E. 2d (), not whether a court should grant relief in any given case. Unlike §–8–2(a), which expressly gives Georgia superior courts “exclusive jurisdiction in all matters of adoption,” §–8–5(a) does not speak to whether a court has the power to decide a general class of cases. It only provides a rule of decision to apply in determining if a particular adoption should be allowed.Section –8–5(a) does not become jurisdictional just because it is “ ‘mandatory’ ” and “ ‘must be strictly construed.’ ” App. to Pet. for Cert. 23a–24a (quotingMarks,supra, at , S. E. 2d, at ). This Court “has long rejected the notion that all mandatory prescriptions, however emphatic, are properly typed jurisdictional.”Gonzalezv.Thaler, U. S., at –) (internal quotation marks and ellipsis omitted). Indeed, the Alabama Supreme Court’s reasoning would give jurisdictional status toeveryrequirement of the Georgia adoption statutes, since Georgia law indicates those requirements are all mandatory and must be strictly construed.Marks,supra, at , S. E. 2d, at . That result would comport neither with Georgia law nor with common sense.As [REDACTED] observed more than a century ago, “it sometimes may be difficult to decide whether certain words in a statute are directed to jurisdiction or to merits.”Fauntleroyv.Lum, U. S. – (). In such cases, especially where the Full Faith and Credit Clause is concerned, a court must be “slow to read ambiguous words, as meaning to leave the judgment open to dispute, or as intended to do more than fix the rule by which the court should decide.”Id., at . That time-honored rule controls here. The Georgia judgment appears on its face to have been issued by a court with jurisdiction, and there is no established Georgia law to the contrary. It follows that the Alabama Supreme Court erred in refusing to grant that judgment full faith and credit.The petition for writ of certiorari is granted. The judgment of the Alabama Supreme Court is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.It is so ordered."}

Decided November 5, 2007Per Curiam.Daniel Siebert was convicted and sentenced to death in the State of Alabama for the murder of Linda Jarman. Siebert’s conviction and sentence were affirmed on direct appeal, and the certificate of judgment issued on May , . This Court denied certiorari on November 5, .Siebertv.Alabama, U. S. . On August , , Siebert filed a petition for postconviction relief in Alabama state court. The state courts denied the petition as untimely, however, because it was filed approximately three months after the expiration of the then-applicable 2-year statute of limitations, 2 Ala. Rule Crim. Proc. .2(c) (–), which began to run from the date the certificate of judgment issued.* The Alabama Supreme Court denied certiorari on September , . Siebert did not seek review in this Court. On September , , Siebert filed a petition for a federal writ of habeas corpus, see U. S. C. §, in the District Court for the Northern District of Alabama.The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of (AEDPA) established a 1-year statute of limitations for filing a federal habeas petition. §(d)(1). The limitations period is tolled, however, while “a properly filed application for State post-conviction or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim is pending.” §(d)(2). Because Siebert’s direct appeal became final before AEDPA became effective, the 1-year limitations period began to run from April , , AEDPA’s effective date. SeeCareyv.Saffold, U. S. , (). Thus, absent tolling, Siebert’s federal habeas petition would be untimely by over four years.The District Court dismissed Siebert’s habeas petition as untimely, reasoning that an application for state postconviction relief is not “properly filed” if it was rejected by the state court on statute-of-limitations grounds. The Court of Appeals reversed, however, holding that Siebert’s state postconviction petition was “properly filed” within the meaning of §(d)(2), because the state time bar was not jurisdictional and the Alabama courts therefore had discretion in enforcing it. SeeSiebertv.Campbell, F. 3d , ( )(per curiam). The Court of Appeals accordingly remanded to the District Court to consider the merits of Siebert’s petition.While Siebert’s habeas petition was pending on remand in the District Court, we decidedPacev.DiGuglielmo, U. S. (). InPace, we held that a state postconviction petition rejected by the state court as untimely is not “properly filed” within the meaning of §(d)(2).Id., at , . Relying onPace, the District Court again found that Siebert’s state postconviction petition was not “properly filed,” and dismissed his federal habeas petition as untimely. The Court of Appeals, however, reversed and remanded. In a one-paragraph opinion, the court distinguishedPaceon the ground that Rule .2(c), unlike the statute of limitations at issue inPace, “operate[s] as an affirmative defense.” F. 3d , ( ). Thus, the court found its prior holding—that Siebert’s state postconviction petition was “properly filed” because the state court rejected it on a nonjurisdictional ground—stood as the law of the case.Ibid.The Court of Appeals’ carve-out of time limits that operate as affirmative defenses is inconsistent with our holding inPace. Although the Pennsylvania statute of limitations at issue inPacehappens to have been a jurisdictional time bar under state law, seeCommonwealthv.Banks, Pa. 1, 5–6, A. 2d , (), the jurisdictional nature of the time limit was not the basis for our decision. Rather, we built upon a distinction that we had earlier articulated inArtuzv.Bennett, U. S. 4(), between postconviction petitions rejected on the basis of “ ‘filing’ conditions,” which are not “properly filed” under §(d)(2), and those rejected on the basis of “procedural bars [that] go to the ability to obtain relief,” which are.Pace,supra, at (citingArtuz,supra, at –). We found that statutes of limitations are “filing” conditions because they “go to the very initiation of a petition and a court’s ability to consider that petition.”Pace, U. S., at . Thus, we held “that time limits,no matter their form, are ‘filing’ conditions,” and that a state postconviction petition is therefore not “properly filed” if it was rejected by the state court as untimely.Ibid.(emphasis added).In short, our holding inPaceturned not on the nature of the particular time limit relied upon by the state court, but rather on the fact that time limits generally establish “conditions to filing” a petition for state postconviction relief. Whether a time limit is jurisdictional, an affirmative defense, or something in between, it is a “condition to filing,”Artuz,supra, at 9—it places a limit on how long a prisoner can wait before filing a postconviction petition. The fact that Alabama’s Rule .2(c) is an affirmative defense that can be waived (or is subject to equitable tolling) renders it no less a “filing” requirement than a jurisdictional time bar would be; it only makes it a less stringent one. Indeed, inPacewe cited the very statute at issue in this case as an example of such a “filing” requirement. See U. S., at , n. 7 (citing 2 Ala. Rule Crim. Proc. .2(c) (–)).Excluding fromPace’s scope those time limits that operate as affirmative defenses would leave a gaping hole in what we plainly meant to be a general rule, as statutes of limitations are often affirmative defenses. See,e.g., Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 8(c);Kirklandv.State, Idaho , , P. 3d , () (“The statute of limitations for petitions for post-conviction relief is not jurisdictional. It ‘is an affirmative defense that may be waived if it is not pleaded by the defendant’ ” (quotingColev.State, Idaho , , P. 3d , (); citation omitted));Peoplev.Boclair, Ill. 2d , , N. E. 2d , () (holding that time bar for filing postconviction petition is “an affirmative defense and can be raised, waived, or forfeited, by the State”). What is more, whether a time limit is jurisdictional or an affirmative defense is often a disputed question, as the interpretive history of Rule .2(c) itself illustrates, seeEx parte Ward, No. , WL , *6 (Ala., June 1, ) (noting confusion in the Alabama lower courts over whether Rule .2(c) is jurisdictional). Under the Court of Appeals’ approach, federal habeas courts would have to delve into the intricacies of state procedural law in deciding whether a postconviction petition rejected by the state courts as untimely was nonetheless “properly filed” under §(d)(2). Our decision inPaceprecludes such an approach.We therefore reiterate now what we held inPace: “When a postconviction petition is untimely under state law, ‘that [is] the end of the matter’ for purposes of §(d)(2).” U. S., at (quotingCarey, U. S., at ; alteration in original). Because Siebert’s petition for state postconviction relief was rejected as untimely by the Alabama courts, it was not “properly filed” under §(d)(2). Accordingly, he was not entitled to tolling of AEDPA’s 1-year statute of limitations.The petition for certiorari is granted. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.* At the time Siebert’s petition was before the Alabama courts, Rule .2(c) provided that “the court shall not entertain any petition,” with certain exceptions not applicable here, “unless the petition is filed ... within two (2) years after the issuance of the certificate of judgment by the Court of Criminal Appeals.” The statute has since been amended to provide for a 1-year limitations period, but is otherwise unchanged. See 1 Ala. Rule Crim. Proc. .2(c) (–)."}

Decided November , 2012Per Curiam.State courts rather than federal courts are most frequently called upon to apply the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9 U. S. C. §1et seq., including the Act’s national policy favoring arbitration. It is a matter of great importance, therefore, that state supreme courts adhere to a correct interpretation of the legislation. Here, the Oklahoma Supreme Court failed to do so. By declaring the noncompetition agreements in two employment contracts null and void, rather than leaving that determination to the arbitrator in the first instance, the state court ignored a basic tenet of the Act’s substantive arbitration law. The decision must be vacated.* * *This dispute arises from a contract between petitioner Nitro-Lift Technologies, L. L. C., and two of its former employees. Nitro-Lift contracts with operators of oil and gas wells to provide services that enhance production. Respondents Eddie Lee Howard and Shane D. Schneider entered a confidentiality and noncompetition agreement with Nitro-Lift that contained the following arbitration clause:“ ‘Any dispute, difference or unresolved question between Nitro-Lift and the Employee (collectively the “Disputing Parties”) shall be settled by arbitration by a single arbitrator mutually agreeable to the Disputing Parties in an arbitration proceeding conducted in Houston, Texas in accordance with the rules existing at the date hereof of the American Arbitration Association.’ ” Pet. for Cert. 5.After working for Nitro-Lift on wells in Oklahoma, Texas, and Arkansas, respondents quit and began working for one of Nitro-Lift’s competitors. Claiming that respondents had breached their noncompetition agreements, Nitro-Lift served them with a demand for arbitration. Respondents then filed suit in the District Court of Johnston County, Oklahoma, asking the court to declare the noncompetition agreements null and void and to enjoin their enforcement. The court dismissed the complaint, finding that the contracts contained valid arbitration clauses under which an arbitrator, and not the court, must settle the parties’ disagreement.The Oklahoma Supreme Court retained respondents’ appeal and ordered the parties to show cause why the matter should not be resolved by application of Okla. Stat., Tit. , §219A (West ), which limits the enforceability of noncompetition agreements. Nitro-Lift argued that any dispute as to the contracts’ enforceability was a question for the arbitrator. It relied for support— as it had done before the trial court—upon several of this Court’s cases interpreting the FAA, and noted that underBuckeye Check Cashing, Inc.v.Cardegna, U.S. , (), “this arbitration law applies in both state and federal courts.” Record in No. , (Okla.), p. .The Oklahoma Supreme Court was not persuaded. It held that despite the “[U. S.] Supreme Court cases on which the employers rely,” the “existence of an arbitration agreement in an employment contract does not prohibit judicial review of the underlying agreement.” OK , ¶, n. , ¶, P.3d , , n. , . For that proposition, the court relied on the “exhaustive overview of the United States Supreme Court decisions construing the Federal Arbitration Act” inBrunerv.Timberlane Manor Ltd. Partnership, OK , P.3d , which found Supreme Court jurisprudence “not to inhibit our review of the underlying contract’s validity.” P. 3d, at . Finding the arbitration clauses no obstacle to its review, the court held that the noncompetition agreements were “void and unenforceable as against Oklahoma’s public policy,” expressed in Okla. Stat., Tit. , § A. P. 3d, at .The Oklahoma Supreme Court declared that its decision rests on adequate and independent state grounds.Id., at –, n. 5. If that were so, we would have no jurisdiction over this case. SeeMichiganv.Long, U.S. , – (). It is not so, however, because the court’s reliance on Oklahoma law was not “independent”—it necessarily depended upon a rejection of the federal claim, which was both “ ‘properly presented to’ ” and “ ‘addressed by’ ” the state court.Howellv.Mississippi, U.S. , () (per curiam) (quotingAdamsv.Robertson, U.S. , () (per curiam)).Nitro-Lift claimed that the arbitrator should decide the contract’s validity, and raised a federal-law basis for that claim by relying on Supreme Court cases construing the FAA. “ ‘[A] litigant wishing to raise a federal issue can easily indicate the federal law basis for his claim in a state-court petition or brief . . . by citing in conjunction with the claim the federal source of law on which he reliesor a case deciding such a claim on federal grounds. . . .’ ”Howell,supra, at (quotingBaldwinv.Reese, U.S. , (); emphasis added). The Oklahoma Supreme Court acknowledged the cases on which Nitro-Lift relied, as well as their relevant holdings, but chose to discount these controlling decisions. Its conclusion that, despite this Court’s jurisprudence, the underlying contract’s validity is purely a matter of state law for state-court deter-mination is all the more reason for this Court to assert jurisdiction.The Oklahoma Supreme Court’s decision disregards this Court’s precedents on the FAA. That Act, which “declare[s] a national policy favoring arbitration,”Southland Corp.v.Keating, U.S. 1, (), provides that a “written provision in . . . a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out of such contract or transaction . . . shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.” 9 U. S. C. §2. It is well settled that “the substantive law the Act created [is] applicable in state and federal courts.”Southland Corp.,supra, at ; see alsoBuckeye,supra, at . And when parties commit to arbitrate contractual disputes, it is a mainstay of the Act’s substantive law that attacks on the validity of the contract, as distinct from attacks on the validity of the arbitration clause itself, are to be resolved “by the arbitrator in the first instance, not by a federal or state court.”Prestonv.Ferrer, U.S. , (); see alsoPrima Paint Corp.v.Flood & Conklin Mfg. Co., U.S. (). For these purposes, an “arbitration provision is severable from the remainder of the contract,”Buckeye,supra, at , and its validity is subject to initial court determination; but the validity of the remainder of the contract (if the arbitration provision is valid) is for the arbitrator to decide.This principle requires that the decision below be va-cated. The trial court found that the contract contained a valid arbitration clause, and the Oklahoma Supreme Court did not hold otherwise. It nonetheless assumed the arbitrator’s role by declaring the noncompetition agreements null and void. The state court insisted that its “[own] jurisprudence controls this issue” and permits review of a “contract submitted to arbitration where one party assert[s] that the underlying agreement [is] void and unenforceable.” P. 3d, at . But the Oklahoma Supreme Court must abide by the FAA, which is “the supreme Law of the Land,” U. S. Const., Art. VI, cl. 2, and by the opinions of this Court interpreting that law. “It is this Court’s responsibility to say what a statute means, and once the Court has spoken, it is the duty of other courts to respect that understanding of the governing rule of law.”Riversv.Roadway Express, Inc., U.S. , (). Our cases hold that the FAA forecloses precisely this type of “judicial hostility towards arbitration.”AT&T Mobility LLCv.Concepcion, U. S., at 8).The state court reasoned that Oklahoma’s statute “addressing the validity of covenants not to compete, must govern over the more general statute favoring arbitration.” P. 3d, at , n. . But the ancient interpretive principle that the specific governs the general (generalia specialibus non derogant) applies only to conflict between laws of equivalent dignity. Where a specific statute, for example, conflicts with a general constitutional provision, the latter governs. And the same is true where a specific state statute conflicts with a general federal statute. There is no general-specific exception to the Supremacy Clause, U. S. Const. Art. VI, cl. 2. “ ‘[W]hen state law prohibits outright the arbitration of a particular type of claim, the analysis is straightforward: The conflicting rule is displaced by the FAA.’ ”Marmet Health Care Center, Inc.v.Brown, U. S., at 6–7)). Hence, it is for the arbitrator to decide in the first instance whether the covenants not to compete are valid as a matter of applicable state law. SeeBuckeye, U. S., at –.For the foregoing reasons, the petition for certiorari is granted. The judgment of the Supreme Court of Oklahoma is vacated, and the case is remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.It is so ordered."}
{"file_name": "per curiam_2017_16-1116_582.json", "author": "per curiam", "year": 2017, "text": "–. Decided June , 2017Per Curiam.Respondent Percy Hutton accused two friends, Derek Mitchell and Samuel Simmons Jr., of stealing a sewing machine, in which he had hidden $. Mitchell and Simmons denied the accusation, but Hutton remained suspicious. On the night of September , , he lured the pair into his car and, after pointing a gun at each, drove them around town in search of the machine. By night’s end, Hutton had recovered his sewing machine, Simmons was in the hospital with two gunshot wounds to the head, and Mitchell was nowhere to be found. Simmons survived, but Mitchell was found dead a few weeks later, also having been shot twice.More than years ago, an Ohio jury convicted Hutton of aggravated murder, attempted murder, and kidnaping. In connection with the aggravated murder conviction, the jury made two additional findings: that Hutton engaged in “a course of conduct involving the . . . attempt to kill two or more persons,” and that Hutton murdered Mitchell while “committing, attempting to commit, or fleeing immediately after . . . kidnapping,” Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §§.(A)(5), (7) (Lexis ). Because of these “aggravating circumstances,” Ohio law required that Hutton be sentenced to “death, life imprisonment without parole, [or] life imprisonment with parole eligibility after” no fewer than years in prison. §.(C)(2).Several days after rendering its verdict, the jury reconvened for the penalty phase of the trial. The State argued for the death penalty. In opposition, Hutton gave an unsworn statement professing his innocence and presented evidence about his background and psychological pro-file. When the presentations concluded, the trial court instructed the jury that it could recommend a death sentence only if it unanimously found that the State had “prove[d] beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circumstances, of which the Defendant was found guilty, outweigh[ed] the [mitigating factors].”Statev.Hutton, Ohio St. 3d , , -Ohio-, N. E. 2d , ; see Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §.(D)(2). The jury deliberated and recommended death. The trial court accepted the recommendation after also finding, “beyond a reasonable doubt, . . . that the aggravating circumstances . . . outweigh[ed] the mitigating factors.” §.(D)(3).The Ohio Court of Appeals and the Ohio Supreme Court affirmed Hutton’s death sentence. In doing so, both concluded that “the evidence support[ed] the finding of the aggravating circumstances.” §.(A); seeHutton, Ohio St. 3d, at , N. E. 2d, at ;Statev.Hutton, Ohio App. 3d , , N. E. 2d , (). The courts also “independently weigh[ed] all of the facts . . . to determine whether the aggravating circumstances [Hutton] was found guilty of committing outweigh[ed] the mitigating factors.” Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §.(A). Both agreed with the jury and the trial court that “aggravating circumstances outweigh[ed] the mitigating factors,” and that a death sentence was warranted.Hutton, Ohio St. 3d, at , N. E. 2d, at –; seeHutton, Ohio App. 3d, at , N. E. 2d, at .The case before this Court concerns Hutton’s subsequent petition for federal habeas relief. In , Hutton filed such a petition pursuant to U. S. C. §, arguing that the trial court violated his due process rights during the penalty phase of his trial. According to Hutton, the court gave the jurors insufficient guidance because it failed to tell them that, when weighing aggravating and mitigating factors, they could consider only the two aggravating factors they had found during the guilt phase. Hutton, however, had not objected to the trial court’s instruction or raised this argument on direct appeal, and the District Court on federal habeas concluded that his due process claim was procedurally defaulted.Huttonv.Mitchell, WL , * (ND Ohio, June 7, ); seeStatev.Hutton, Ohio St. 3d , , n. 1, N. E. 2d , –, n. 1 () (declining to address trial court’s instructions because Hutton “specifically declined to object . . . at trial, and ha[d] not raised or briefed the issue” on appeal).The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed. The court concluded that, notwithstanding the procedural default, it could “reach the merits” of Hutton’s claim to “avoid a fundamental miscarriage of justice.”Huttonv.Mitchell, F. 3d , () (internal quotation marks omitted). The Sixth Circuit began its analysis withSawyerv.Whitley, U. S. () . In that decision, this Court established that a habeas petitioner may obtain review of a defaulted claim upon “show[ing] by clear and convincing evidence that, but for a constitutional error, no reasonable jury would have found [him] eligible for the death penalty under the applicable state law.”Id.,at .Hutton had not argued that this exception to default applied to his case. Nonetheless, the Sixth Circuit held that the exception justified reviewing his claim. The court gave two reasons: First, Hutton was not eligible to receive a death sentence because “the jury had not made the necessary finding of the existence of aggravating circumstances.” F. 3d, at –. And second, since the trial court “gave the jury no guidance as to what to con-sider as aggravating circumstances” when weighing aggravating and mitigating factors, the record did not show that the jury’s death recommendation “was actually based on a review of any valid aggravating circumstances.”Id.,at . On the merits, the court concluded that the trial court violated Hutton’s constitutional rights by giving an erroneous jury instruction. Judge Rogers dissented on the ground that Hutton could not overcome the procedural default.The Sixth Circuit was wrong to reach the merits of Hutton’s claim. The court’s first reason for excusing default was that “the jury had not [found] the existence of aggravating circumstances.”Id.,at –. But it had, at the guilt phase of Hutton’s trial. As Judge Rogers pointed out, “the jury found two such factors”—engaging in a course of conduct designed to kill multiple people and committing kidnaping—“in the process of convicting Hutton . . . of aggravated murder.”Id.,at . Each of those findings “rendered Hutton eligible for the death penalty.”Ibid.Hutton has not argued that the trial court improperly instructed the jury about aggravating circumstances at the guilt phase. Nor did the Sixth Circuit identify any such error. Instead, the instruction that Hutton contends is incorrect, and that the Sixth Circuit analyzed, was given at thepenaltyphase of trial. That penalty phase instruction plainly had no effect on the jury’s decision—delivered after theguiltphase and pursuant to an unchallenged instruction—that aggravating circumstances were present when Hutton murdered Mitchell.The Sixth Circuit’s second reason for reaching the merits rests on a legal error. UnderSawyer, a court may review a procedurally defaulted claim if, “but for a constitutional error, no reasonable jury would have found the petitioner eligible for the death penalty.” U. S., at (emphasis added). Here, the alleged error was the trial court’s failure to specify that, when weighing aggravating and mitigating factors, the jury could consider only the aggravating circumstances it found at the guilt phase. Assuming such an error can provide a basis for excusing default, the Sixth Circuit should have considered the following: Whether, givenproperinstructions about the two aggravating circumstances, a reasonable jury could have decided that those aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstances.But the court did not ask that question. Instead, it considered whether, given the (alleged)improperinstructions, the jury might have been relying on invalid aggravating circumstances when it recommended a death sentence. See F. 3d, at (explaining that, because the trial court gave “no guidance as to what to consider as aggravating circumstances,” the court could not determine whether the death recommendation “was actually based on a review of any valid aggravating circumstances”). The court, in other words, considered whether the alleged error might have affected the jury’s verdict, not whether a properly instructed jury could have recommended death. That approach, which would justify excusing default whenever an instructional error could have been relevant to a jury’s decision, is incompatible withSawyer.Neither Hutton nor the Sixth Circuit has “show[n] by clear and convincing evidence that”—if properly in-structed—“no reasonable juror would have” concluded that the aggravating circumstances in Hutton’s case outweigh the mitigating circumstances.Sawyer, U. S., at . In fact, the trial court, Ohio Court of Appeals, and Ohio Supreme Court each independently weighed those factors and concluded that the death penalty was justified. On the facts of this case, the Sixth Circuit was wrong to hold that it could review Hutton’s claim under the miscarriage of justice exception to procedural default.The petition for certiorari and motion for leave to proceedin forma pauperisare granted, the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered."}
{"file_name": "per curiam_2014_263_571.json", "author": "per curiam", "year": 2014, "text": "– Decided February , 2014Per Curiam.InStricklandv.Washington, U.S. (), we held that a criminal defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to counsel is violated if his trial attorney’s performance falls below an objective standard of reasonableness and if there is a reasonable probability that the result of the trial would have been different absent the deficient act or omission.Id.,at –, . Anthony Ray Hinton, an inmate on Alabama’s death row, asks us to decide whether the Alabama courts correctly appliedStricklandto his case. We conclude that they did not and hold that Hinton’s trial attorney rendered constitutionally deficient performance. We vacate the lower court’s judgment and remand the case for reconsideration of whether the attorney’s deficient performance was prejudicial.IAIn February , a restaurant manager in Birming-ham was shot to death in the course of an after-hours rob-bery of his restaurant. A second manager was murdered duraing a very similar robbery of another restaurant in July. Then, later in July, a restaurant manager named Smotherman survived another similar robbery-shooting. During each crime, the robber fired two . caliber bullets; all six bullets were recovered by police investigators. Smotherman described his assailant to the police, and when the police showed him a photographic array, he picked out Hinton’s picture.The police arrested Hinton and recovered from his house a . caliber revolver belonging to his mother, who shared the house with him. After analyzing the six bullets fired during the three crimes and test-firing the revolver, examiners at the State’s Department of Forensic Sciences concluded that the six bullets had all been fired from the same gun: the revolver found at Hinton’s house. Hinton was charged with two counts of capital murder for the killings during the first two robberies. He was not charged in connection with the third robbery (that is, the Smotherman robbery).At trial, the State’s strategy was to link Hinton to the Smotherman robbery through eyewitness testimony and forensic evidence about the bullets fired at Smotherman and then to persuade the jury that, in light of the similar-ity of the three crimes and forensic analysis of the bullets and the Hinton revolver, Hinton must also have committed the two murders. Smotherman identified Hinton as the man who robbed his restaurant and tried to kill him, and two other witnesses provided testimony that tended to link Hinton to the Smotherman robbery. Hinton maintained that he was innocent and that Smotherman had misidentified him. In support of that defense, Hinton presented witnesses who testified in support of his alibi that he was at work at a warehouse at the time of the Smotherman robbery. So. 2d , – (Ala. ) (summarizing the evidence on each side of the case).The six bullets and the revolver were the only physical evidence. Besides those items, the police found no evidence at the crime scenes that could be used to identify the perpetrator (such as fingerprints) and no incriminating evidence at Hinton’s home or in his car. The State’s case turned on whether its expert witnesses could convince the jury that the six recovered bullets had indeed been fired from the Hinton revolver. According to the Alabama Supreme Court, “the only evidence linking Hinton to the two murders were forensic comparisons of the bullets recovered from those crime scenes to the Hinton revolver.” WL , *2 (Oct. , ).The category of forensic evidence at issue in this case is “firearms and toolmark” evidence. Toolmark examiners attempt to determine whether a bullet recovered from a crime scene was fired from a particular gun by comparing microscopic markings (toolmarks) on the recovered bullet to the markings on a bullet known to have been fired from that gun. The theory is that minor differences even between guns of the same model will leave discernible traces on bullets that are unique enough for an examiner to conclude that the recovered bullet was or was not fired from a given weapon. See generally National Research Council, Strengthening Forensic Science in the United States: A Path Forward – ().Recognizing that Hinton’s defense called for an effective rebuttal of the State’s expert witnesses, Hinton’s attorney filed a motion for funding to hire an expert witness of his own. In response, the trial judge granted $1, with this statement:“ ‘I don’t know as to what my limitations are as for how much I can grant, but I can grant up to $. in each case [that is, for each of the two murder charges, which were tried together] as far as I know right now and I’m granting up to $. in each of these two cases for this. So if you need additional experts I would go ahead and file on a separate form and I’ll have to see if I can grant additional experts, but I am granting up to $., which is the statutory maximum as far as I know on this and if it’s necessary that we go beyond that then I may check to see if we can, but this one’s granted.’ ” WL , * (Ala. Crim. App., Apr. , ) (Cobb, J., dissenting) (quoting Tr. ).Hinton’s attorney did not take the judge up on his invitation to file a request for more funding.In fact, $ per case ($1, total) wasnotthe statu-tory maximum at the time of Hinton’s trial. An earlier version of the statute had limited state reimbursement of expenses to one half of the $1, statutory cap on attorney’s fees, which explains why the judge believed that Hinton was entitled to up to $ for each of the two murder charges. SeeSmelleyv.State, So. 2d , (Ala. Crim. App. ). But the relevant statute had been amended to provide: “ ‘Counsel shall also be entitled to be reimbursed for any expenses reasonably incurred in such defense to be approved in advance by the trial court.’ ” SeeDubosev.State, So. 2d , , n. 5 (Ala. Crim. App. ) (quoting Ala. Code §––(d) ()), aff’ So. 2d (Ala. ). That amendment went into effect on June , ,Dubose,supra,at , n. 5, which was over a year before Hinton was arrested, so Hinton’s trial attorney could have corrected the trial judge’s mistaken belief that a $1, limit applied and accepted his invitation to file a motion for additional funds.The attorney failed to do so because he was himself unaware that Alabama law no longer imposed a specific limit and instead allowed reimbursement for “any expenses reasonably incurred.” At an evidentiary hearing held on Hinton’s postconviction petition, the following conversation occurred between a state attorney and Hinton’s trial attorney:“Q. You did an awful lot of work to try and find what you believed to be a qualified expert in this case, didn’t you?“A. Yes, sir, I did.“Q. Would you characterize it that you did everything that you knew to do?“A. Yes, sir, I think so.“Q. And this case, did it come down to an unwillingness of experts to work for the price that you were able to pay?“A. Yes, sir, I think it did.“Q. So your failure to get an expert that you would have been let’s say a hundred percent satisfied with was not a failure on your part to go out and do some act, it was a failure of the court to approve what you believed would have been sufficient funds?“A. Well, putting it a little differently, yes, sir, it was a failure—it was my failure, my inability under the statute to obtain any more funding for the purpose of hiring qualified experts.” Reporter’s Official Tr. – (emphasis added).Operating under the mistaken belief that he could pay no more than $1,, Hinton’s attorney went looking for an expert witness. According to his postconviction testimony, he made an extensive search for a well-regarded expert, but found only one person who was willing to take the case for the pay he could offer: Andrew Payne. Hinton’s attorney “testified that Payne did not have the expertise he thought he needed and that he did not consider Payne’s testimony to be effective.” WL , *. As he told the trial judge during a pretrial hearing:“I made an effort to get somebody that I thought would be useable. And I’ll have to tell you what I did [about] Payne. I called a couple of other lawyers in town . . . to ask if they knew of anybody. One of them knew him; one of them knew him. The reason I didn’t contact him was because he wasn’t recommended by the lawyer. So now I’m stuck that he’s the only guy I could possibly produce.”Id.,at * (internal quotation marks omitted).At trial, Payne testified that the toolmarks in the barrel of the Hinton revolver had been corroded away so that it would be impossible to say with certainty whether a particular bullet had been fired from that gun. He also testified that the bullets from the three crime scenes did not match one another. The State’s two experts, by contrast, maintained that all six bullets had indeed been fired from the Hinton revolver.On cross-examination, the prosecutor badly discredited Payne. Payne admitted that he’d testified as an expert on firearms and toolmark identification just twice in the preceding eight years and that one of the two cases involved a shotgun rather than a handgun. Payne also conceded that he had had difficulty operating the microscope at the state forensic laboratory and had asked for help from one of the state experts. The prosecutor ended the cross-examination with this colloquy:“Q. Mr. Payne, do you have some problem with your vision?“A. Why, yes.“Q. How many eyes do you have?“A. One.” Tr. .The prosecutor’s closing argument highlighted the fact that Payne’s expertise was in military ordnance, not firearms and toolmark identification, and that Payne had graduated in (more than half a century before the trial) with a degree in civil engineering, whereas the State’s experts had years of training and experience in the field of firearms and toolmark examination. The prosecutor said:“ ‘I ask you to reject [Payne’s] testimony and you have that option because you are the judges of the facts and whose testimony, Mr. Yates’ or Mr. Payne’s, you will give credence to, and I submit to you that as between these two men there is no match between them. There is no comparison. One man just doesn’t have it and the other does it day in and day out, month in and month out, year in and year out, and is recognized across the state as an expert.’ ” WL , * (Cobb, J., dissenting) (quoting Tr. –).The jury convicted Hinton and recommended by a - to-2 vote that he be sentenced to death. The trial judge accepted that recommendation and imposed a death sentence.BIn his state postconviction petition, Hinton contended that his trial attorney was “ ‘ineffective to not seek additional funds when it became obvious that the individual willing to examine the evidence in the case for the $1, allotted by the court was incompetent and unqualified. Indeed, this failure to seek additional, sufficient funds is rendered all the more inexplicable by the trial court’s express invitation to counsel to seek more funds if such funds were necessary.’ ” WL , *.To show that he had been prejudiced by Payne’s ineffective testimony, Hinton produced three new experts on toolmark evidence. One of the three, a forensic consultant named John Dillon, had worked on toolmark identification at the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s forensics laboratory and, from until he retired in , had served as chief of the firearms and toolmark unit at the FBI’s headquarters. The other two postconviction experts had worked for many years as firearms and toolmark examiners at the Dallas County Crime Laboratory and had each testified as toolmark experts in several hundred cases.All three experts examined the physical evidence and testified that they could not conclude that any of the six bullets had been fired from the Hinton revolver. The State did not submit rebuttal evidence during the postconviction hearing, and one of Hinton’s experts testified that, pursuant to the ethics code of his trade organization, the Association of Firearm and Tool Mark Examiners, he had asked the State’s expert, Yates, to show him how he had determined that the recovered bullets had been fired from the Hinton revolver. Yates refused to cooperate.CThe circuit court denied Hinton’s postconviction petition on the ground that Hinton had not been prejudiced by Payne’s allegedly poor performance because Payne’s testimony did not depart from what Hinton’s postconviction experts had said: The bullets could not be affirmatively matched either to one another or to the Hinton revolver.The Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed by a 3-to-2 vote. WL . The court agreed with the circuit court that Hinton had not been prejudiced because Payne’s testimony, if believed by the jury, strongly supported the inference that Hinton was innocent.Id.,at *. Then-Judge Cobb (who later became chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court) dissented. In her view, Hinton’s attorney had been ineffective in failing to seek additional funds to hire a better expert and Hinton had been prejudiced by that failure, meaning that he was entitled to a new trial. Then-Judge Shaw (who is now a justice of the Alabama Supreme Court) also dissented. He would have remanded the case to the circuit court to make a finding as to whether or not Payne was qualified to act as an expert on toolmark evidence. He stated that “[i]t goes without saying that, with knowledge that sufficient funds were available to have a qualified firearms and toolmarks expert, no reasonable criminal defense lawyer would seek out and hire an unqualified firearms witness.”Id.,at *.The Supreme Court of Alabama reversed and remanded. WL . After quoting at length from Judge Shaw’s dissent, the Court stated, “We agree with Judge Shaw that ‘the dispositive issue is whether Payne was a qualified firearms and toolmarks expert’ and that in denying Hinton’s [postconviction] petition the trial court did not directly rule on ‘the issue whether Payne was qualified to be testifying in the first place.’ ”Id.,at *4 (quoting WL , *, * (Shaw, J., dissenting)). The Supreme Court was thus focused on Payne’s own qualifications, rather than on whether a better expert—one who could have been hired had the attorney learned that there was no funding cap and requested additional funds—would have made a more compelling case for Hinton.On remand, the circuit court held that Payne was indeed qualified to testify as a firearms and toolmark expert witness under the Alabama evidentiary standard in place at the time of the trial, which required only that Payne have had “knowledge of firearms and toolmarks exam-ination beyond that of an average layperson.” WL , *5 (Ala. Crim. App., Dec. , ); see alsoCharlesv.State, So. 2d , (Ala. Crim. App. ) (“An ‘expert witness’ is one who can enlighten a jury more than the average man in the street. . . . An expert witness, by definition, is any person whose opportunity or means of knowledge in a specialized art or science is to some degree better than that found in the average juror or witness”). The appellate court affirmed the circuit court’s ruling that Payne was qualified under the applicable standard. WL (Ala. Crim. App., Feb. , ). The Alabama Supreme Court denied review by a 4-to-3 vote, with two justices recused. Hinton then filed this petition for a writ of certiorari.IIThis case calls for a straightforward application of our ineffective-assistance-of-counsel precedents, beginning withStricklandv.Washington, U.S. .Stricklandrecognized that the Sixth Amendment’s guarantee that “[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right . . . to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence” entails that defendants are entitled to be represented by an attorney who meets at least a minimal standard of competence.Id.,at –. “UnderStrickland, we first determine whether counsel’s representation ‘fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.’ Then we ask whether ‘there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.’ ”Padillav.Kentucky, U.S. , () (quotingStrickland,supra,at , ).A“The first prong—constitutional deficiency—is necessarily linked to the practice and expectations of the legal community: ‘The proper measure of attorney performance remains simply reasonableness under prevailing professional norms.’ ”Padilla,supra,at (quotingStrickland,supra,at ). “In any case presenting an ineffectiveness claim, the performance inquiry must be whether counsel’s assistance was reasonable considering all the circumstances.”Strickland,supra,at . Under that standard, it was unreasonable for Hinton’s lawyer to fail to seek additional funds to hire an expert where that failure was based not on any strategic choice but on a mistaken belief that available funding was capped at $1,.“Criminal cases will arise where the only reasonable and available defense strategy requires consultation with experts or introduction of expert evidence.”Harringtonv.Richter, U. S., at ). This was such a case. As Hinton’s trial attorney recognized, the core of the prosecution’s case was the state experts’ conclusion that the six bullets had been fired from the Hinton revolver, and effectively rebutting that case required a competent expert on the defense side. Hinton’s attorney also recognized that Payne was not a good expert, at least with respect to toolmark evidence. Nonetheless, he felt he was “stuck” with Payne because he could not find a better expert willing to work for $1, and he believed that he was unable to obtain more than $1, to cover expert fees.As discussed above, that belief was wrong: Alabama law in effect beginning more than a year before Hinton was arrested provided for state reimbursement of “any expenses reasonably incurred in such defense to be approved in advance by the trial court.” Ala. Code §––(d). And the trial judge expressly invited Hinton’s attorney to file a request for further funds if he felt that more funding was necessary. Yet the attorney did not seek further funding.The trial attorney’s failure to request additional funding in order to replace an expert he knew to be inadequate because he mistakenly believed that he had received all he could get under Alabama law constituted deficient performance. UnderStrickland, “strategic choices made after thorough investigation of law and facts relevant to plausible options are virtually unchallengeable; and strategic choices made after less than complete investigation are reasonable precisely to the extent that reasonable professional judgments support the limitations on investigation. In other words, counsel has a duty to make reasonable investigations or to make a reasonable decision that makes particular investigations unnecessary.” U. S., at –. Hinton’s attorney knew that he needed more funding to present an effective defense, yet he failed to make even the cursory investigation of the state statute providing for defense funding for indigent defendants that would have revealed to him that he could receive reimbursement not just for $1, but for “any expenses reasonably incurred.” An attorney’s ignorance of a point of law that is fundamental to his case combined with his failure to perform basic research on that point is a quintessential example of unreasonable performance underStrickland. See,e.g.,Williamsv.Taylor, U.S. , () (finding deficient performance where counsel “failed to conduct an investigation that would have uncovered extensive records [that could be used for death penalty mitigation purposes], not because of any strategic calcu-lation but because they incorrectly thought that state law barred access to such records”);Kimmelmanv.Morrison, U.S. , () (finding deficient performance where counsel failed to conduct pretrial discovery and that failure “was not based on ‘strategy,’ but on counsel’s mistaken belie[f ] that the State was obliged to take the initiative and turn over all of its inculpatory evidence to the defense”).We wish to be clear that the inadequate assistance of counsel we find in this case does not consist of the hiring of an expert who, though qualified, was not qualified enough. The selection of an expert witness is a paradigmatic example of the type of “strategic choic[e]” that, when made “after thorough investigation of [the] law and facts,” is “virtually unchallengeable.”Strickland, U. S., at . We do not today launch federal courts into examination of the relative qualifications of experts hired and experts that might have been hired. The only inadequate assistance of counsel here was the inexcusable mistake of law—the unreasonable failure to understand the resources that state law made available to him—that caused counsel to employ an expert thathe himselfdeemed inadequate.BHaving established deficient performance, Hinton must also “show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.”Id.,at . “When a defendant challenges a conviction, the question is whether there is a reasonable probability that, absent the errors, the factfinder would have had a reasonable doubt respecting guilt.”Id.,at .The Court of Criminal Appeals held, and the State contends in its brief in opposition to certiorari, that Hinton could not have been prejudiced by his attorney’s use of Payne rather than a more qualified expert because Payne said all that Hinton could have hoped for from a toolmark expert: that the bullets used in the crimes could not have been fired from the Hinton revolver. See WL , * (“[E]ven assuming that counsel’s apparent ignorance that the cap on expert expenses had been lifted constituted deficient performance . . . , the appellant has not shown that he was prejudiced by that deficient performance”). It is true that Payne’s testimony would have done Hinton a lot of goodif the jury had believed it. But the jury did not believe Payne. And if there is a reasonable probability that Hinton’s attorney would have hired an expert who would have instilled in the jury a reasonable doubt as to Hinton’s guilt had the attorney known that the statutory funding limit had been lifted, then Hinton was prejudiced by his lawyer’s deficient performance and is entitled to a new trial.That the State presented testimony from two experienced expert witnesses that tended to inculpate Hinton does not, taken alone, demonstrate that Hinton is guilty. Prosecution experts, of course, can sometimes make mistakes. Indeed, we have recognized the threat to fair criminal trials posed by the potential for incompetent or fraudulent prosecution forensics experts, noting that “[s]erious deficiencies have been found in the forensic evidence used in criminal trials. . . . One study of cases in which exon-erating evidence resulted in the overturning of criminal convictions concluded that invalid forensic testimony contributed to the convictions in % of the cases.”Melendez-Diazv.Massachusetts, U.S. , () (citing Garrett & Neufeld, Invalid Forensic Science Testimony and Wrongful Convictions, Va.

S. C. §5031et seq. Respondent eventually pleaded “true” to knowingly engaging in sexual acts with a person under years of age, which would have been a crime under §§(c) and (a) if committed by an adult. In June , the District Court accepted respondent’s plea and adjudged him delinquent. The court sentenced respondent to two years’ official detention and juvenile delinquent supervision until his 21st birthday. The court also ordered respondent to spend the first six months of his juvenile supervision in a prerelease center and to abide by the center’s conditions of residency.In , Congress enacted the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA), Stat. , U. S. C. §16901et seq. With respect to juvenile offenders, SORNA requires individuals who have been adjudicated delinquent for certain serious sex offenses to register and to keep their registrations current in each jurisdiction where they live, work, and go to school. §§(8); . In February , the Attorney General issued an interim rule specifying that SORNA’s requirements “apply to all sex offenders, including sex offenders convicted of the offense for which registration is required prior to the enactment of [SORNA].” Fed. Reg. (codified at CFR §.3 ()).In July , the District Court revoked respondent’s juvenile supervision, finding that respondent had failed to comply with the requirements of the prerelease program. The court sentenced respondent to an additional 6-month term of official detention, to be followed by a period of supervision until his 21st birthday. The Government, invoking SORNA’s juvenile registration provisions, argued that respondent should be required to register as a sex offender, at least for the duration of his juvenile supervision. As “special conditions” of his supervision, the court ordered respondent to register as a sex offender and to keep his registration current. App. to Pet. for Cert. 39a.The Ninth Circuit vacated the sex-offender-registration requirements of the District Court’s order. F. 3d (). The Court of Appeals determined that “retroactive application of SORNA’s provision covering individuals who were adjudicated juvenile delinquents because of the commission of certain sex offenses before SORNA’s passage violates the Ex Post Facto Clause of the United States Constitution.”Id., at . The court thus held that “SORNA’s juvenile registration provision may not be applied retroactively to individuals adjudicated delinquent under the [FJDA].”Id., at .The United States asks us to grant certiorari to review the Ninth Circuit’s determination that SORNA violates theEx Post FactoClause as applied to individuals who were adjudicated juvenile delinquents under the FJDA prior to SORNA’s enactment. Before we can address that question, however, we must resolve a threshold issue of mootness. Before the Ninth Circuit, respondent challenged only the conditions of his juvenile supervision requiring him to register as a sex offender. But on May 2, , respondent’s term of supervision expired, and thus he no longer is subject to those sex-offender-registration conditions. As such, this case likely is moot unless respondent can show that a decision invalidating the sex-offender-registration conditions of his juvenile supervision would be sufficiently likely to redress “collateral consequences adequate to meet Article III’s injury-in-fact requirement.”Spencerv.Kemna, U. S. 1, ().Perhaps the most likely potential “collateral consequenc[e]” that might be remedied by a judgment in respondent’s favor is the requirement that respondent remain registered as a sex offender under Montana law. (“By the time of the court of appeals’ decision, respondent had become registered as a sex offender in Montana, where he continues to be registered today.” Pet. for Cert. .) We thus must know whether a favorable decision in this case would make it sufficiently likely that respondent “could remove his name and identifying information from the Montana sex offender registry.”Ibid. Therefore, we certify the following question to the Supreme Court of Montana, pursuant to Montana Rule of Appellate Procedure ():Is respondent’s duty to remain registered as a sex offender under Montana law contingent upon the validity of the conditions of his now-expired federal juvenile-supervision order that required him to register as a sex offender, see Mont. Code Ann. §§––(6)(b), –5–(1)(c) ();Statev.Villanueva, Mont. , –, P. 3d , – (); see also §––(9)(b) (), or is the duty an independent requirement of Montana law that is unaffected by the validity or invalidity of the federal juvenile-supervision conditions, see §––() (); Mont. Laws ch. , §, p. ?We respectfully request that the Montana Supreme Court accept our certified question. The court’s answer to this question will help determine whether this case presents a live case or controversy, and there is no controlling appellate decision, constitutional provision, or statute on point. Mont. Rule App. Proc. (3). We understand that the Montana Supreme Court may wish to reformulate the certified question. Rule (6)(a)(iii).The Clerk of this Court is directed to transmit to the Supreme Court of Montana a copy of this opinion, the briefs filed in this Court in this case, and a list of the counsel appearing in this matter along with their names and addresses.

Without first seeking to pursue grievance procedures under his collective-bargaining agreement, he filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Alaska, alleging the FAA tested him in a nonrandom manner, in violation of his constitutional rights and U. S. C. §(8).The FAA has its own procedural framework for the resolution of claims by its employees; and for this purpose it adopts certain sections of the Civil Service Reform Act of (CSRA), including Chapter of Title 5, which sets forth the rules for grievances. U. S. C. §(g)(2)(C). The District Court held that, under the provisions of the CSRA, it was without jurisdiction to consider the petitioner’s claims. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed, stating that because “5 U. S. C. §(a)(1), as amended in , does not expressly confer federal court jurisdiction over employment-related claims covered by the negotiated grievance procedures of federal employees’ collective bargaining agreements,” his claims are precluded. F. 3d , (). This Court granted certiorari to review the judgment. U. S.The Court of Appeals was correct to say that 5 U. S. C. §(a)(1) does not confer jurisdiction. Another statute, however—a very familiar one—grants jurisdiction to the federal courts over “all civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.” U. S. C. §. The question, then, is not whether 5 U. S. C. § confers jurisdiction, but whether § (or the CSRA as a whole) removes the jurisdiction given to the federal courts, seeVerizon Md. Inc.v.Public Serv. Comm’n of Md., U. S. , () (holding that “even if [ U. S. C.] §(e)(6) does notconferjurisdiction, it at least does notdivestthe district courts of their authority under U. S. C. § to review the Commission’s order for compliance with federal law”), or otherwise precludes employees from pursuing remedies beyond those set out in the CSRA, cf.United Statesv.Fausto, U. S. , – ();Abbott Laboratoriesv.Gardner, U. S. , () (“The question is phrased in terms of ‘prohibition’ rather than ‘authorization’ because ... judicial review of a final agency action by an aggrieved person will not be cut off unless there is persuasive reason to believe that such was the purpose of Congress”).In deciding the question of jurisdiction and preclusion, the Court would be required first to ascertain where Whitman’s claims fit within the statutory scheme, as the CSRA provides different treatment for grievances depending on the nature of the claim. It may be, for example, that the FAA’s actions, as described by the petitioner, constitute a “prohibited personnel practice.” See 5 U. S. C. §(b); U. S. C. §(g)(2)(A). Both the petitioner and the Government say they do not, but because the ultimate question may be jurisdictional, this concession ought not to be accepted out of hand. SeeWeinbergerv.Bentex Pharmaceuticals, Inc., U. S. , () (“Parties, of course, cannot confer jurisdiction; only Congress can do so”). The Court of Appeals did not decide whether the petitioner’s allegations state a “prohibited personnel practice.” The proper course, then, is to remand for the Court of Appeals to address the matter, seeNational Collegiate Athletic Assn.v.Smith, U. S. , (), as well as the ultimate issue of preclusion. The various other issues raised before this Court, but not decided below, may also be addressed on remand, including: whether the petitioner has challenged final agency action; whether the petitioner has exhausted his administrative remedies; whether exhaustion is required given this statutory scheme and the Administrative Procedure Act, as interpreted inDarbyv.Cisneros, U. S. (); and whether the Government has forfeited its exhaustion-of-remedies argument.

{"file_name": "per curiam_2016_15-833_578.json", "author": "per curiam", "year": 2016, "text": "– Decided May , 2016Per Curiam.The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of (AEDPA) requires a state prisoner seeking federal habeas relief first to “exhaus[t] the remedies available in the courts of the State.” U. S. C. §(b)(1)(A). If the state courts adjudicate the prisoner’s federal claim “on the merits,” §(d), then AEDPA mandates deferential, rather thande novo, review, prohibiting federal courts from granting habeas relief unless the state-court decision “was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law,” §(d)(1), or “was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts,” §(d)(2). The Ninth Circuit in this case decided that the Supreme Court of California’s summary denial of a habeas petition wasnot“on the merits,” and therefore AEDPA’s deferential-review provisions did not apply. We summarily reverse.Respondent Antonio Hinojosa was serving a -year sentence for armed robbery and related crimes when,in , California prison officials “validated” him as a prison-gang associate and placed him in a secured housing unit. At the time of Hinojosa’s offense and conviction, California law had permitted prisoners placed in a secured housing unit solely by virtue of their prison-gang affiliations to continue to accrue good-time credits. See Cal. Penal Code Ann. §.6 (West ). In , the California Legislature amended the law so that prison-gang associates placed in a secured housing unit could no longer earn future good-time credits, although they would retain any credits already earned. §.6(a) (West Supp. ).Hinojosa filed a state habeas petition, arguing (as relevant here) that applying the new law to him violated the Federal Constitution’s prohibition ofex post factolaws. See Art. I, §, cl. 1;Weaverv.Graham, U. S. () . The Orange County Superior Court denied the claim “on grounds petitioner has not sought review of his claim of error in the proper judicial venue.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 44a. The court explained:“ ‘Although any superior court has jurisdiction to entertain and adjudicate a petition for writ of habeas corpus, it does not follow that it should do so in all instances.’ Challenges to conditions of an inmate’s confinement should be entertained by the superior court of county wherein the inmate is confined. (Griggs v. Superior Court() Cal. 3d , .)“The petition for writ of habeas corpus is DENIED.”Id., at 44a–45a.[1]Rather than file a new petition in the correct venue (Kings County Superior Court), Hinojosa turned to the appellate court, which summarily denied his petition. Instead of appealing that denial, see Cal. Penal Code Ann. § (West Supp. ), Hinojosa sought an original writ of habeas corpus in the Supreme Court of California, see Cal. Const., Art. 6, §, which summarily denied relief without explanation.A petition for federal habeas relief followed. Adopting the Magistrate Judge’s findings and recommendation, the District Court denied Hinojosa’sex post factoclaim under AEDPA’s deferential review. A Ninth Circuit panel reversed.Hinojosav.Davey, F. 3d (). Citing our decision inYlstv.Nunnemaker, U. S. () , the panel “looked through” the Supreme Court of California’s summary denial to the last reasoned decision adjudicating Hinojosa’s claim: the Superior Court’s dismissal for improper venue. The panel reasoned that the Superior Court’s decision “is not a determination ‘on the merits’ ” and that as a result it was “not bound by AEDPA.” F. 3d, at . Having thus freed itself from AEDPA’s strictures, the court granted Hinojosa’s petition for habeas relief.We reverse. InYlst, we said that where “the last reasoned opinion on the claim explicitly imposes a procedural default, we will presume that a later decision rejecting the claim did not silently disregard that bar and consider the merits.” U. S., at . We adopted this presumption because “silence implies consent, not the opposite—and courts generally behave accordingly, affirming without further discussion when they agree, not when they disagree, with the reasons given below.”Id.,at . But we pointedly refused to make the presumption irrebuttable; “strong evidence can refute it.”Ibid.It is amply refuted here. Improper venue could not possibly have been a ground for the high court’s summary denial of Hinojosa’s claim. There is only one Supreme Court of California—and thus only one venue in which Hinojosa could have sought an original writ of habeas corpus in that court. Under these circumstances, it cannot be that the State Supreme Court’s denial “rest[ed] upon the same ground” as the Superior Court’s.Id.,at . It quite obviously rested upon some different ground.Ylst’s “look-through” approach is therefore inapplicable.[2]Hinojosa resists this conclusion, remarking that “a reviewing court has discretion to denywithout prejudicea habeas corpus petition that was not filed first in a proper lower court.”In re Steele, Cal. 4th , , P. 3d , () (emphasis added). But there is no indication that the summary denial here was without prejudice, thus refuting Hinojosa’s speculation.Containing no statement to the contrary, the Supreme Court of California’s summary denial of Hinojosa’s petition was therefore on the merits.Harringtonv.Richter, U. S. , () . Accordingly, the Ninth Circuit should have reviewed Hinojosa’sex post factoclaim through AEDPA’s deferential lens. And although we express no view on the merits of that claim, we note that the Ninth Circuit has already held that state-court denials of claims identical to Hinojosa’s are not contrary to clearly established federal law. SeeNevarezv.Barnes, F. 3d ( ); see alsoIn re Efstathiou, Cal. App. 4th , –, Cal. Rptr. 3d , – ();In re Sampson, Cal. App. 4th , –, Cal. Rptr. 3d , – (). The panel below recognized as much: “If AEDPA applies here, we are bound by our decision inNevarezand must affirm the district court’s denial of Hinojosa’s petition.” F. 3d, at . AEDPA applies here.The petition for a writ of certiorari and Hinojosa’s motion for leave to proceedin forma pauperisare granted, and the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is reversed.It is so ordered.Notes1InGriggsv.Superior Ct. of San Bernardino Cty., Cal. 3d , , P. 2d , (), the Supreme Court of California stated that “[a]s a general rule,” if a prisoner files a habeas petition challenging the conditions of his confinement in a county other than the one in which he is confined, the court should not deny the petition unless it fails to state a prima facie case. In this case, however, there is no hint in the opinion of the Superior Court that it followed this approach, and petitioner does not claim that it did.2Alternatively, if the Superior Court in fact followedGriggs’ instructions and silently concluded that the claim did not state a prima facie case for relief, see n. 1,supra, the decision of the Supreme Court of California would still be a decision on the merits, and the AEDPA standard of review would still apply."}

Decided November , 2019Per Curiam.Alaska law limits the amount an individual can contribute to a candidate for political office, or to an election-oriented group other than a political party, to $ per year. Alaska Stat. §..(b)(1) (). Petitioners Aaron Downing and Jim Crawford are Alaska residents. In , they contributed the maximum amounts permitted under Alaska law to candidates or groups of their choice, but wanted to contribute more. They sued members of the Alaska Public Offices Commission, contending that Alaska’s individual-to-candidate and individual-to-group contribution limits violate the First Amendment.The District Court upheld the contribution limits and the Ninth Circuit agreed. F.3d ();Thompsonv.Dauphinais, F. Supp. 3d (Alaska ). Applying Circuit precedent, the Ninth Circuit analyzed whether the contribution limits furthered a “sufficiently important state interest” and were “closely drawn” to that end. F. 3d, at (quotingMontana Right to Life Assn.v.Eddleman, F.3d , (); internal quotation marks omitted). The court recognized that our decisions inCitizens Unitedv.Federal Election Comm’nandMcCutcheonv.Federal Election Comm’nnarrow “the type of state interest that justifies a First Amendment intrusion on political contributions” to combating “actual quid pro quo corruption or its appearance.” F. 3d, at (citingMcCutcheonv.Federal Election Comm’n, U.S. , – ();Citizens Unitedv.Federal Election Comm’n, U.S. , – ()). The court below explained that under its precedent in this area “the quantum of evidence necessary to justify a legitimate state interest is low: the perceived threat must be merely more than ‘mere conjecture’ and ‘not . . . illusory.’ ” F. 3d, at (quotingEddleman, F. 3d, at ; some internal quotation marks omitted). The court acknowledged that “McCutcheonandCitizens Unitedcreated some doubt as to the continuing vitality of [this] standard,” but noted that the Ninth Circuit had recently reaffirmed it. F. 3d, at , n. 2.After surveying the State’s evidence, the court concluded that the individual-to-candidate contribution limit “ ‘focuses narrowly on the state’s interest,’ ‘leaves the contributor free to affiliate with a candidate,’ and ‘allows the candidate to amass sufficient resources to wage an effective campaign,’ ” and thus survives First Amendment scrutiny.Id., at (quotingEddleman, F. 3d, at ; alterations omitted); see also F. 3d, at –. The court also found the individual-to-group contribution limit valid as a tool for preventing circumvention of the individual-to-candidate limit. Seeid., at –.In reaching those conclusions, the Ninth Circuit declined to apply our precedent inRandallv.Sorrell, U.S. (), the last time we considered a non-aggregate contribution limit. See F. 3d, at , n. 5. InRandall, we invalidated a Vermont law that limited individual contributions on a per-election basis to: $ to a candidate for Governor, Lieutenant Governor, or other statewide office; $ to a candidate for state senator; and $ to a candidate for state representative. [REDACTED]’s opinion for the plurality observed that “contribution limits that are too low can . . . harm the electoral process by preventing challengers from mounting effective campaigns against incumbent officeholders, thereby reducing democratic accountability.” U. S., at –; see alsoid., at – ([REDACTED], J., concurring in judgment) (agreeing that Vermont’s contribution limits violated the First Amendment);id., at – ([REDACTED], J., joined by [REDACTED], J., concurring in judgment) (agreeing that Vermont’s contribution limits violated the First Amendment while arguing that such limits should be subject to strict scrutiny). A contribution limit that is too low can therefore “prove an obstacle to the very electoral fairness it seeks to promote.”Id., at (plurality opinion).[1]*InRandall, we identified several “danger signs” about Vermont’s law that warranted closer review.Ibid. Alaska’s limit on campaign contributions shares some of those characteristics. First, Alaska’s $ individual-to-candidate contribution limit is “substantially lower than . . . the limits we have previously upheld.”Id., at . The lowest campaign contribution limit this Court has upheld remains the limit of $1, per two-year election cycle for candidates for Missouri state auditor in .Id., at (citingNixonv.Shrink Missouri Government PAC, U.S. ()). That limit translates to over $1, in today’s dollars. Alaska permits contributions up to months prior to the general election and thus allows a maximum contribution of $1, over a comparable two-year period. Alaska Stat. §..(c)(1). Accordingly, Alaska’s limit is less than two-thirds of the contribution limit we upheld inShrink.Second, Alaska’s individual-to-candidate contribution limit is “substantially lower than . . . comparable limits in other States.”Randall, U. S., at . Most state contribution limits apply on a per-election basis, with primary and general elections counting as separate elections. Because an individual can donate the maximum amount in both the primary and general election cycles, the per-election contribution limit is comparable to Alaska’s annual limit and -month campaign period, which functionally allow contributions in both the election year and the year preceding it. Only five other States have any individual-to-candidate contribution limit of $ or less per election: Colorado, Connecticut, Kansas, Maine, and Montana. Colo. Const., Art. XXVIII, §3(1)(b); 8 Colo. Code Regs. –6, Rule ..1(b)(2) (); Conn. Gen. Stat. §9–(a)(5) (); Kan. Stat. Ann. §–(a)(2) ( Cum. Supp.); Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. –A, §(1) ( Cum. Supp.); Mont. Code Ann. §§––(1)(a)(ii), (iii) (). Moreover, Alaska’s $ contribution limit applies uniformly to all offices, including Governor and Lieutenant Governor. Alaska Stat. §..(b)(1). But Colorado, Connecticut, Kansas, Maine, and Montana all have limits above $ for candidates for Governor and Lieutenant Governor, making Alaska’s law the most restrictive in the country in this regard. Colo. Const., Art. XXVIII, §3(1)(a)(I); 8 Colo. Code Regs. –6, Rule ..1(b)(1)(A); Conn. Gen. Stat. §§9–(a)(1), (2); Kan. Stat. Ann. §–(a)(1); Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. –A, §(1); Mont. Code Ann. §––(1)(a)(i).Third, Alaska’s contribution limit is not adjusted for inflation. We observed inRandallthat Vermont’s “failure to index limits means that limits which are already suspiciously low” will “almost inevitably become too low over time.” U. S., at . The failure to index “imposes the burden of preventing the decline upon incumbent legislators who may not diligently police the need for changes in limit levels to ensure the adequate financing of electoral challenges.”Ibid.So too here. In fact, Alaska’s $ contribution limit is the same as it was years ago, in . Alaska Sess. Laws ch. , §(b)(1).InRandall, we noted that the State had failed to provide “any special justification that might warrant a contribution limit so low.” U. S., at . The parties dispute whether there are pertinent special justifications here.In light of all the foregoing, the petition for certiorari is granted, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for that court to revisit whether Alaska’s contribution limits are consistent with our First Amendment precedents.It is so ordered.*The court below declined to considerRandall“because no opinion commanded a majority of the Court,” F. 3d, at , n. 5, instead relying on its own precedent predatingRandallby three years.

TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, et al., APPELLANTSv.NEW YORK, et al.on appeal from the united states district court for the southern district of new york[December , ]Per Curiam.Every ten years, the Nation undertakes an “Enumeration” of its population “in such Manner” as Congress “shall by Law direct.” U. S. Const., Art. I, §2, cl. 3. This census plays a critical role in apportioning Members of the House of Representatives among the States, allocating federal funds to the States, providing information for intrastate redistricting, and supplying data for numerous initiatives conducted by governmental entities, businesses, and academic researchers.Department of Commercev.New York, U. S., at 2).Congress has given both the Secretary of Commerce and the President functions to perform in the enumeration and apportionment process. The Secretary must “take a decennial census of population . . . in such form and content as he may determine,” U. S. C. §(a), and then must report to the President “[t]he tabulation of total population by States” under the census “as required for the apportionment,” §(b). The President in turn must transmit to Congress a “statement showing the whole number of persons in each State, excluding Indians not taxed, as ascertained” under the census. 46Stat. , 2 U. S. C. §2a(a). In that statement, the President must apply a mathematical formula called the “method of equal proportions” to the population counts in order to calculate the number of House seats for each State.Ibid.; seeDepartment of Commercev.Montana, U.S. , – ().This past July, the President issued a memorandum to the Secretary respecting the apportionment following the census. The memorandum announced a policy of excluding “from the apportionment base aliens who are not in a lawful immigration status.” Fed. Reg. (). To facilitate implementation “to the maximum extent feasible and consistent with the discretion delegated to the executive branch,” the President ordered the Secretary, in preparing his §(b) report, “to provide information permitting the President, to the extent practicable, to exercise the President’s discretion to carry out the policy.”Ibid.The President directed the Secretary to include such information in addition to a tabulation of population according to the criteria promulgated by the Census Bureau for counting each State’s residents.Ibid.; see Fed. Reg. ().This case arises from one of several challenges to the memorandum brought by various States, local governments, organizations, and individuals. A three-judge District Court held that the plaintiffs, appellees here, had standing to proceed in federal court because the memorandum was chilling aliens and their families from responding to the census, thereby degrading the quality of census data used to allocate federal funds and forcing some plaintiffs to divert resources to combat the chilling effect. Supp. , ) (per curiam). According to the District Court, the memorandum violates §(b) by ordering the Secretary to produce two sets of numbers—a valid tabulation derived from the census, and an invalid tabulation excluding aliens based on administrative records outside the census.Id. The District Court also ruled that the exclusion of aliens on the basis of legal status would contravene the requirement in §2a(a) that the President state the “whole number of persons in each State” for purposes of apportionment.Id. The District Court declared the memorandum unlawful and enjoined the Secretary from including the information needed to implement the memorandum in his §(b) report to the President.Id. The Government appealed, and we postponed consideration of our jurisdiction. U. S.A foundational principle of Article III is that “an actual controversy must exist not only at the time the complaint is filed, but through all stages of the litigation.”Already, LLCv.Nike, Inc., U.S. , – () (internal quotation marks omitted). As the plaintiffs concede, any chilling effect from the memorandum dissipated upon the conclusion of the census response period. The plaintiffs now seek to substitute an alternative theory of a “legally cognizable injury” premised on the threatened impact of an unlawful apportionment on congressional representation and federal funding.Id.,at . As the case comes to us, however, we conclude that it does not—at this time—present a dispute “appropriately resolved through the judicial process.”Susan B. Anthony Listv.Driehaus, U.S. , () (internal quotation marks omitted).Two related doctrines of justiciability—each originating in the case-or-controversy requirement of Article III—underlie this determination. SeeDaimlerChrysler Corp.v.Cuno, U.S. , (). First, a plaintiff must demonstrate standing, including “an injury that is concrete, particularized, and imminent rather than conjectural or hypothetical.”Carneyv.Adams,ante, at 6 (internal quotation marks omitted). Second, the case must be “ripe”—not dependent on “contingent future events that may not occur as anticipated, or indeed may not occur at all.”Texasv.United States, U.S. , () (internal quotation marks omitted).At present, this case is riddled with contingencies and speculation that impede judicial review. The President, to be sure, has made clear his desire to exclude aliens without lawful status from the apportionment base. But the President qualified his directive by providing that the Secretary should gather information “to the extent practicable” and that aliens should be excluded “to the extent feasible.” Fed. Reg. . Any prediction how the Executive Branch might eventually implement this general statement of policy is “no more than conjecture” at this time.Los Angelesv.Lyons, U.S. , ().To begin with, the policy may not prove feasible to implement in any manner whatsoever, let alone in a manner substantially likely to harm any of the plaintiffs here. Pre-apportionment litigation always “presents a moving target” because the Secretary may make (and the President may direct) changes to the census up until the President transmits his statement to the House.Franklinv.Massachusetts, U.S. , – (). And as the Government recognizes, Tr. of Oral Arg. , any such changes must comply with the constitutional requirement of an “actual Enumeration” of the persons in each State, as opposed to a conjectural estimate. SeeUtahv.Evans, U.S. , – (); see also U. S. C. §. Here the record is silent on which (and how many) aliens have administrative records that would allow the Secretary to avoid impermissible estimation, and whether the Census Bureau can even match the records in its possession to census data in a timely manner. See Reply Brief 4–5. Uncertainty likewise pervades which (and how many) aliens the President will exclude from the census if the Secretary manages to gather and match suitable administrative records. We simply do not know whether and to what extent the President might direct the Secretary to “reform the census” to implement his general policy with respect to apportionment.Franklin, U. S., at .While the plaintiffs agree that the dispute will take a more concrete shape once the Secretary delivers his report under §(b), Tr. of Oral Arg. , , they insist that the record already establishes a “substantial risk” of reduced representation and federal resources,Clapperv.Amnesty Int’l USA, U.S. , , n. 5 (). That conclusion, however, involves a significant degree of guesswork. Unlike other pre-apportionment challenges, the Secretary has not altered census operations in a concrete manner that will predictably change the count. See,e.g.,Department of Commercev.New York, U. S., at );Department of Commercev.United States House of Representatives, U.S. , – (). The count here is complete; the present dispute involves the apportionment process, which remains at a preliminary stage. The Government’s eventual action will reflect both legal and practical constraints, making any prediction about future injury just that—a prediction.Everyone agrees by now that the Government cannot feasibly implement the memorandum by excluding the estimated .5 million aliens without lawful status. Tr. of Oral Arg. , –. Yet the only evidence speaking to the predicted change in apportionment unrealistically assumes that the President will exclude the entire undocumented population. App. , Decl. of Christopher Warshaw ¶. Nothing in the record addresses the consequences of a partial implementation of the memorandum, much less supports the dissent’s speculation that excluding aliens in ICE detention will impact interstate apportionment.Post, at 5–6, 9 (opinion of [REDACTED], J.); see Reply Brief 6.The impact on funding is no more certain. According to the Government, federal funds are tied to data derived from the census, but not necessarily to the apportionment counts addressed by the memorandum. Brief for Appellants –. Under that view, changes to the Secretary’s §(b) report or to the President’s §2a(a) statement will not inexorably have the direct effect on downstream access to funds or other resources predicted by the dissent.Post, at 6–7. How that question will be addressed by the Secretary and the President is yet another fundamental uncertainty impeding proper judicial consideration at this time.The remedy crafted by the District Court underscores the contingent nature of the plaintiffs’ injuries. Its injunction prohibits the Secretary from informing the President in his §(b) report of the number of aliens without lawful status. In addition to implicating the President’s authority under the Opinions Clause, U. S. Const., Art. II, §2, cl. 1, the injunction reveals that the source of any injury to the plaintiffs is the action that the Secretary or Presidentmighttake in the future to exclude unspecified individuals from the apportionment base—not the policy itself “in the abstract,”Summersv.Earth Island Institute, U.S. , (). Letting the Executive Branch’s decisionmaking process run its course not only brings “more manageable proportions” to the scope of the parties’ dispute,Lujanv.National Wildlife Federation, U.S. , (), but also “ensures that we actas judges, and do not engage in policymaking properly left to elected representatives,”Hollingsworthv.Perry, U.S. , (). And in the meantime the plaintiffs suffer no concrete harm from the challenged policy itself, which does not require them “to do anything or to refrain from doing anything.”Ohio Forestry Assn., Inc.v.Sierra Club, U.S. , ().At the end of the day, the standing and ripeness inquiries both lead to the conclusion that judicial resolution of this dispute is premature. Consistent with our determination that standing has not been shown and that the case is not ripe, we express no view on the merits of the constitutional and related statutory claims presented. We hold only that they are not suitable for adjudication at this time.The judgment of the District Court is vacated, and the case is remanded with instructions to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.It is so ordered."}

The Wisconsin Legislature passed new maps to fix the problem, but the Governor vetoed them. At an impasse, the legislature and the Governor turned to the Wisconsin Supreme Court, which had already agreed to hear an original action brought by a group of voters seeking to remedy the malapportionment. Rather than attempt to draw new maps itself, the court invited the parties and intervenors—including the legislature and the Governor—to propose maps that complied with the State Constitution, the Federal Constitution, and the Voting Rights Act of (VRA), 79Stat. , as amended, U. S. C. §10301et seq., and that otherwise minimized changes from the current maps.On March 3, the court issued a decision selecting the Assembly and Senate maps that the Governor had proposed.Johnsonv. W. (Because the State Constitution requires three Assembly districts to be nested within each Senate district, the court analyzed and selected the maps as a unit.Id., ¶.) The Governor’s Assembly map intentionally created seven majority-black districts—one more than the current map.[1] The Governor argued that the addition of a seventh majority-black district was necessary for compliance with the VRA. In adopting the Governor’s map, the court explained: “[W]e cannot say for certain on this record that seven majority-Black assembly districts are required by the VRA.”Id., ¶. It nevertheless concluded that the Governor’s map complied with the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because there were “good reasons” to think that the VRA “may” require the additional majority-black district.Id., ¶.The legislature and the voters who initiated the state-court proceeding now seek relief from that decision. They argue that the court selected race-based maps without sufficient justification, in violation of the Equal Protection Clause. They ask this Court either to grant an emergency stay or to construe their application as a petition for certiorari and reverse the decision below.We agree that the court committed legal error in its application of decisions of this Court regarding the relationship between the constitutional guarantee of equal protection and the VRA. We accordingly construe the application for stay presented to [REDACTED] and by her referred to the Court as a petition for certiorari, grant the petition, reverse the imposition of the Governor’s State Assembly and Senate maps, and remand to the Wisconsin Supreme Court for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. Summarily correcting the error gives the court sufficient time to adopt maps consistent with the timetable for Wisconsin’s August 9th primary election.* * *Under the Equal Protection Clause, districting maps that sort voters on the basis of race “ ‘are by their very nature odious.’ ”Shawv.Reno, U.S. , (). Such laws “cannot be upheld unless they are narrowly tailored to achieving a compelling state interest.”Millerv.Johnson, U.S. , (). We have assumed that complying with the VRA is a compelling interest.Cooperv.Harris, U. S., at 2). And we have held that if race is the predominant factor motivating the placement of voters in or out of a particular district, the State bears the burden of showing that the design of that district withstands strict scrutiny.Ibid.Thus, our precedents hold that a State can satisfy strict scrutiny if it proves that its race-based sorting of voters is narrowly tailored to comply with the VRA.Ibid.A State violates §2 of the VRA “if, based on the totality of circumstances, it is shown that the political processes leading to nomination or election in the State or political subdivision are not equally open to participation by members of [a minority group] in that its members have less opportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice.” U. S. C. §(b). We have construed §2 to prohibit the distribution of minority voters into districts in a way that dilutes their voting power. SeeThornburgv.Gingles, U.S. , – (). InGingles, we provided a framework for demonstrating a violation of that sort. First, three “preconditions” must be shown: (1) The minority group must be sufficiently large and compact to constitute a majority in a reasonably configured district, (2) the minority group must be politically cohesive, and (3) a majority group must vote sufficiently as a bloc to enable it to usually defeat the minority group’s preferred candidate.Id., at –.If the preconditions are established, a court considers the totality of circumstances to determine “whether the political process is equally open to minority voters.”Id., at ; see alsoJohnsonv.De Grandy, U.S. , – () (satisfying theGinglespreconditions is necessary but not sufficient to show a §2 violation; “courts must also examine other evidence in the totality of circumstances”). We have identified as relevant to the totality analysis several factors enumerated in the Senate Report on the amendments to the VRA, as well as “whether the number of districts in which the minority group forms an effective majority is roughly proportional to its share of the population in the relevant area.”League of United Latin American Citizensv.Perry, U.S. , () (LULAC).We said inCooperthat when a State invokes §2 to justify race-based districting, “it must show (to meet the ‘narrow tailoring’ requirement) that it had ‘a strong basis in evidence’ for concluding that the statute required its action.” U. S., at 3). The Wisconsin Supreme Court concluded that the Governor’s intentional addition of a seventh majority-black district triggered the Equal Protection Clause and thatCooper’s strict-scrutiny test must accordingly be satisfied. Accepting those conclusions, we hold that the court erred in its efforts to applyCooper’s understanding of what the Equal Protection Clause requires.It is not clear whether the court viewed the Governor or itself as the state mapmaker who must satisfy strict scrutiny, but the court’s application ofCooperwas flawed either way. If the former, the Governor failed to carry his burden. His main explanation for drawing the seventh majority-black district was that there is now a sufficiently large and compact population of black residents to fill it, Brief for Intervenor-Respondent Evers inJohnsonv.Wisconsin Elections Comm’n, No. –OA (Wis. Sup. Ct., Dec. , ), p. —apparently embracing just the sort of uncritical majority-minority district maximization that we have expressly rejected.De Grandy, U. S., at (“Failure to maximize cannot be the measure of §2”). He provided almost no other evidence or analysis supporting his claim that the VRA required the seven majority-black districts that he drew. See WI , ¶¶–, – (Ziegler, C. J., dissenting). Strict scrutiny requires much more. SeeAbbottv.Perez, U. S., at ) (“[W]here we have accepted a State’s ‘good reasons’ for using race in drawing district lines, the State made a strong showing of a pre-enactment analysis with justifiable conclusions”). If the Wisconsin Supreme Court was reviewing whether the Governor satisfied strict scrutiny, it erred by adopting his maps.If, on the other hand, the court sought to shoulder strict scrutiny’s burden itself, it fared little better.First, it misunderstoodCooper’s inquiry. The court believed that it had to conclude only that the VRAmightsupport race-based districting—not that the statute required it. See WI , ¶¶, (“[W]e cannot say for certain on this record that seven majority-Black assembly districts are required by the VRA,” but “we see good reasons to conclude a seventh majority-Black assembly districtmaybe required” (emphasis added)). Our precedent instructs otherwise. Thus inCooperwe explained, for example, that “race-based districting is narrowly tailored . . . if a State had ‘good reasons’ for thinking that the Actdemandedsuch steps.” U. S., at ) (emphasis added). And we concluded that “experience gave the State no reason to think that the VRArequired” it to move voters based on race.Id., at ) (emphasis added). That principle grew out of the more general proposition that “the institution that makes the racial distinction must have had a ‘strong basis in evidence’ to conclude that remedial action wasnecessary, ‘beforeit embarks on an affirmative-action program.’ ”Shawv.Hunt, U.S. , () (some emphasis added).To be sure, we said inCooperthat States have “ ‘breathing room’ ” to make reasonable mistakes; we will not fault a State just because its “compliance measures . . . may prove, in perfect hindsight, not to have been needed.” U. S., at 3). But that “leeway” does not allow a State to adopt a racial gerrymander that the State does not, at the time of imposition, “judg[e] necessary under a proper interpretation of the VRA.”Id., at ).Second, the court’s analysis ofGingles’ preconditions fell short of our standards. As we explained inCooper, “[t]o have a strong basis in evidence to conclude that §2 demands . . . race-based steps, the State must carefully evaluate whether a plaintiff could establish theGinglespreconditions . . . in a new district created without those measures.” U. S., at ). Rather than carefully evaluating evidence at the district level, the court improperly relied on generalizations to reach the conclusion that the preconditions were satisfied. Seeid. 5 (slip op., at , n. 5) (a “generalized conclusion fails to meaningfully . . . address the relevant local question” whether the preconditions would be satisfied as to each district).The court’s entire discussion of the first precondition was to say that “it is undisputed” and “the parties’ submissions demonstrate” that seven sufficiently large and compact majority-black districts could be drawn. WI , ¶. Similarly, its discussion of the second precondition consisted of nothing but the statement that “[e]xperts from multiple parties analyzed voting trends and concluded political cohesion existed; no party disagreed.”Id., ¶. And while the court did cite one specific expert report for the third precondition—calculating, based on eight previous races, how often white voters in the Milwaukee area defeat the preferred candidate of black voters—it made virtually no effort to parse that data at the district level or respond to criticisms of the expert’s analysis.Id., ¶; seeid., ¶¶– (Ziegler, C. J., dissenting).[2]Third, the court improperly reducedGingles’ totality-of-circumstances analysis to a single factor. The court acknowledged the Senate factors but concluded that they had no role to play in its analysis. WI , ¶, and n. . Instead, it focused exclusively on proportionality. Seeid., ¶¶–. We rejected just that approach inDe Grandy, explaining that “[n]o single statistic provides courts with a shortcut to determine whether a set of single-member districts unlawfully dilutes minority voting strength.” U. S., at –; see alsoid., at (O’Connor, J., concurring) (“The Court . . . makes clear that proportionality is never dispositive. Lack of proportionality can never by itself prove dilution, for courts must always carefully and searchingly review the totality of the circumstances”).The question that our VRA precedents ask and the court failed to answer is whether a race-neutral alternative that did not add a seventh majority-black district would deny black voters equal political opportunity. Answering that question requires an “ ‘ “intensely local appraisal” ’ of the challenged district.”LULAC, U. S., at . When the Wisconsin Supreme Court endeavored to undertake a full strict-scrutiny analysis, it did not do so properly under our precedents, and its judgment cannot stand.* * *The judgment of the Supreme Court of Wisconsin is reversed as to the selection of the Governor’s State Assembly and Senate maps, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. On remand, the court is free to take additional evidence if it prefers to reconsider the Governor’s maps rather than choose from among the other submissions. Any new analysis, however, must comply with our equal protection jurisprudence.It is so ordered.Notes1The Governor’s map accomplished this addition by reducing the black voting-age population in the other six majority-black districts. The black voting-age populations in the Governor’s seven districts all cluster between .1% and .4%, compared to the current six districts’ range of % to %. See WI , ¶ (Ziegler, C. J., dissenting).2That sole piece of cited record evidence came from an intervenor who argued that the Governor’s mapviolatedthe VRA. See WI , ¶¶, (Ziegler, C. J., dissenting); Response Brief for Intervenor-Petitioner Black Leaders Organizing for Communities et al. inJohnsonv.Wisconsin Elections Comm’n, No. –OA (Wis. Sup. Ct., Dec. , ), pp. 7–. The court did not acknowledge or respond to that argument."}

Decided November 5, 2012Per Curiam.This case concerns the award of attorney’s fees in a suit alleging unconstitutional conduct by government officials. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit held that a plaintiff who secured a permanent injunction but no monetary damages was not a “prevailing party” under U. S. C. §, and so could not receive fees. That was error. Because the injunction ordered the defendant officials to change their behavior in a way that directly benefited the plaintiff, we vacate the Fourth Cir- cuit’s decision and remand for further proceedings.* * *Petitioner Steven Lefemine and members of Columbia Christians for Life (CCL) engage in demonstrations in which they carry pictures of aborted fetuses to protest the availability of abortions. On November 3, , Lefemine and about other CCL members conducted such a demonstration at a busy intersection in Greenwood County, South Carolina. Citing complaints about the graphic signs, a Greenwood County police officer informed Lefemine that if the signs were not discarded, he would be ticketed for breach of the peace. Lefemine objected, asserting that the officer was violating his First Amendment rights, but the threat eventually caused him to disband the protest. SeeLefeminev.Davis, F. Supp. 2d , – (SC ).A year later, an attorney for Lefemine sent a letter to Dan Wideman, the sheriff of Greenwood County, informing him that the group intended to return to the same site with the disputed signs. The letter cautioned that further interference would cause Lefemine “ ‘to pursue all avail- able legal remedies.’ ”Id.,at . Chief Deputy Mike Frederick responded that the police had not previously violated Lefemine’s rights, and warned that “ ‘should we observe any protester or demonstrator committing the same act, we will again conduct ourselves in exactly the same manner: order the person(s) to stop or face criminal sanctions.’ ”Ibid.Out of fear of those sanctions, the group chose not to protest in the county for the next two years. Seeibid.On October , , Lefemine filed a complaint under U. S. C. § against several Greenwood County police officers alleging violations of his First Amendment rights. Lefemine sought nominal damages, a declaratory judgment, a permanent injunction, and attorney’s fees. See F. Supp. 2d, at . Ruling on the parties’ dueling motions for summary judgment, the District Court determined that the defendants had infringed Lefemine’s rights. Seeid.,at –. The court therefore permanently enjoined the defendants “from engaging in content-based restrictions on [Lefemine’s] display of graphic signs” under similar circumstances.Id.,at . The court, however, refused Lefemine’s request for nominal damages, finding that the defendants were entitled to qualified immunity because the illegality of their conduct was not clearly established at the time. Seeibid.The court as well denied Lefemine’s request for attorney’s fees under §, stating that “[u]nder the totality of the facts in this case the award of attorney’s fees is not warranted.”Ibid.The Fourth Circuit affirmed the denial of attorney’s fees on the ground that the District Court’s judgment did not make Lefemine a “prevailing party” under §. F.3d , – ().[1] The court reasoned that the relief awarded did not “ ‘alte[r] the relative positions of the parties’ ”: The injunction prohibited only “unlawful, but not legitimate, conduct by the defendant[s],” and merely “ordered [d]efendants to comply with the law and safeguard [Lefemine’s] constitutional rights in the future. No other damages were awarded.”Ibid.Lefemine sought a writ of certiorari to review the Fourth Circuit’s determination that he was not a prevailing party under §.The Civil Rights Attorney’s Fees Awards Act of , 90Stat. , U. S. C. §, allows “the prevailing party” in certain civil rights actions, including suits brought under §, to recover “a reasonable attorney’s fee.” A plaintiff “prevails,” we have held, “when actual relief on the merits of his claim materially alters the legal relationship between the parties by modifying the defendant’s behavior in a way that directly benefits the plaintiff.”Farrarv.Hobby, U.S. , – (). And we have repeatedly held that an injunction or declaratory judgment, like a damages award, will usually satisfy that test. See,e.g.,Rhodesv.Stewart, U.S. 1, 4 () (per curiam).Under these established standards, Lefemine was a prevailing party. Lefemine desired to conduct demonstrations in Greenwood County with signs that the defendant police officers had told him he could not carry. He brought this suit in part to secure an injunction to protect himself from the defendants’ standing threat of sanctions. And he succeeded in removing that threat. The District Court held that the defendants had violated Lefemine’s rights and enjoined them from engaging in similar conduct in the future. Contrary to the Fourth Circuit’s view, that ruling worked the requisite material alteration in the parties’ relationship. Before the ruling, the police intended to stop Lefemine from protesting with his signs; after the ruling, the police could not prevent him from demonstrating in that manner. So when the District Court “ordered [d]efendants to comply with the law,” F. 3d, at , the relief given—as in the usual case involving such an injunction—supported the award of attorney’s fees.Because Lefemine is a “prevailing party,” he “should ordinarily recover an attorney’s fee unless special circumstances would render such an award unjust.”Hensleyv.Eckerhart, U.S. , () (internal quotation marks omitted). Neither of the courts below addressed whether any special circumstances exist in this case, and we do not do so; whether there may be other grounds on which the police officers could contest liability for fees is not a question before us. Accordingly, the petition for certiorari is granted, the judgment of the Fourth Circuit is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.Notes1The defendants did not appeal the District Court’s judgment that they had violated Lefemine’s First Amendment rights, so the Court of Appeals took as a given that a violation had occurred.

Decided January 8, 2018Per Curiam.Petitioner Keith Tharpe moved to reopen his federal habeas corpus proceedings regarding his claim that the Georgia jury that convicted him of murder included a white juror, Barney Gattie, who was biased against Tharpe because he is black. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. (b)(6). The District Court denied the motion on the ground that, among other things, Tharpe’s claim was procedurally defaulted in state court. The District Court also noted that Tharpe could not overcome that procedural default because he had failed to produce any clear and convincing evidence contradicting the state court’s determination that Gattie’s presence on the jury did not prejudice him. SeeTharpev.Warden, No. 5:–cv– (MD Ga., Sept. 5, ), App. B to Pet. for Cert. .Tharpe sought a certificate of appealability (COA). The Eleventh Circuit denied his COA application after deciding that jurists of reason could not dispute that the District Court’s procedural ruling was correct. SeeTharpev.Warden, WL , *3 (Sept. , ). The Eleventh Circuit’s decision, as we read it, was based solely on its conclusion, rooted in the state court’s factfinding, that Tharpe had failed to show prejudice in connection with his procedurally defaulted claim,i.e., that Tharpe had “failed to demonstrate that Barney Gattie’s behavior ‘had substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury’s verdict.’ ”Ibid.(quotingBrechtv.Abrahamson, U. S. , () ).Our review of the record compels a different conclusion. The state court’s prejudice determination rested on its finding that Gattie’s vote to impose the death penalty was not based on Tharpe’s race. SeeTharpev.Warden, No. –cv– (Super. Ct. Butts Cty., Ga., Dec. 1, ), App. F to Pet. for Cert. . And that factual determination is binding on federal courts, including this Court, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary. See U. S. C. §(e)(1). Here, however, Tharpe produced a sworn affidavit, signed by Gattie, indicating Gattie’s view that “there are two types of black people: 1. Black folks and 2. Niggers”; that Tharpe, “who wasn’t in the ‘good’ black folks category in my book, should get the electric chair for what he did”; that “[s]ome of the jurors voted for death because they felt Tharpe should be an example to other blacks who kill blacks, but that wasn’t my reason”; and that, “[a]fter studying the Bible, I have wondered if black people even have souls.” App. B to Pet. for Cert. – (internal quotation marks omitted). Gattie’s remarkable affidavit—which he never retracted—presents a strong factual basis for the argument that Tharpe’s race affected Gattie’s vote for a death verdict. At the very least, jurists of reason could debate whether Tharpe has shown by clear and convincing evidence that the state court’s factual determination was wrong. The Eleventh Circuit erred when it concluded otherwise.The question of prejudice—the ground on which the Eleventh Circuit chose to dispose of Tharpe’s application—is not the only question relevant to the broader inquiry whether Tharpe should receive a COA. The District Court denied Tharpe’s Rule (b) motion on several grounds not addressed by the Eleventh Circuit. We express no view of those issues here. In light of the standard for relief from judgment under Rule (b)(6), which is available only in “ ‘extraordinary circumstances,’ ”Gonzalezv.Crosby, U. S. , () , Tharpe faces a high bar in showing that jurists of reason could disagree whether the District Court abused its discretion in denying his motion. It may be that, at the end of the day, Tharpe should not receive a COA. And review of the denial of a COA is certainly not limited to grounds expressly addressed by the court whose decision is under review. But on the unusual facts of this case, the Court of Appeals’ review should not have rested on the ground that it was indisputable among reasonable jurists that Gattie’s service on the jury did not prejudice Tharpe.We therefore grant Tharpe’s motion to proceedin forma pauperis, grant the petition for certiorari, vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals, and remand the case for further consideration of the question whether Tharpe is entitled to a COA.It is so ordered."}

She claimed that a third officer refused to investigate her complaint that she had been assaulted by residents of her apartment complex and had threatened to issue a citation if she reported this to another police department. In addition, she alleged that the police chief failed to follow up on a promise to investigate the officers’ conduct and that the present and former mayors were aware of unlawful conduct by the town’s police officers.Petitioner’s complaint asserted a violation of her First Amendment right to the free exercise of religion and her Fourth Amendment right to be free of any unreasonable search or seizure. The defendants moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim on which relief may be granted, arguing that the defendants were entitled to qualified immunity. Petitioner then moved to amend her complaint, but the District Court denied that motion and granted the motion to dismiss.On appeal, petitioner, now represented by counsel, argued only that her free exercise rights were violated by the two officers who entered her home. The Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed the decision of the District Court, concluding that the officers were entitled to qualified immunity. F. 3d (). Chief Judge Tymkovich filed a concurring opinion. While agreeing with the majority regarding petitioner’s First Amendment claim, he noted that petitioner’s “allegations fit more neatly in the Fourth Amendment context.”Id.,at . He also observed that if the allegations in the complaint are true, the conduct of the officers “should be condemned,” and that if the allegations are untrue, petitioner had “done the officers a grave injustice.”Ibid.The petition filed in this Court contends that the Court of Appeals erred in holding that the officers who visited petitioner’s home are entitled to qualified immunity. The petition argues that it was clearly established that law enforcement agents violate a person’s right to the free exercise of religion if they interfere, without any legitimate law enforcement justification, when a person is at prayer. The petition further maintains that the absence of a prior case involving the unusual situation alleged to have occurred here does not justify qualified immunity.There can be no doubt that the First Amendment protects the right to pray. Prayer unquestionably constitutes the “exercise” of religion. At the same time, there are clearly circumstances in which a police officer may lawfully prevent a person from praying at a particular time and place. For example, if an officer places a suspect under arrest and orders the suspect to enter a police vehicle for transportation to jail, the suspect does not have a right to delay that trip by insisting on first engaging in conduct that, at another time, would be protected by the First Amendment. When an officer’s order to stop praying is alleged to have occurred during the course of investigative conduct that implicates Fourth Amendment rights, the First and Fourth Amendment issues may be inextricable.That is the situation here. As the case comes before us, it is unclear whether the police officers were in petitioner’s apartment at the time in question based on her consent, whether they had some other ground consistent with the Fourth Amendment for entering and remaining there, or whether their entry or continued presence was unlawful. Petitioner’s complaint contains no express allegations on these matters. Nor does her complaint state what, if anything, the officers wanted her to do at the time when she was allegedly told to stop praying. Without knowing the answers to these questions, it is impossible to analyze petitioner’s free exercise claim.In considering the defendants’ motion to dismiss, the District Court was required to interpret thepro secomplaint liberally, and when the complaint is read that way, it may be understood to state Fourth Amendment claims that could not properly be dismissed for failure to state a claim. We appreciate that petitioner elected on appeal to raise only a First Amendment argument and not to pursue an independent Fourth Amendment claim, but under the circumstances, the First Amendment claim demanded consideration of the ground on which the officers were present in the apartment and the nature of any legitimate law enforcement interests that might have justified an order to stop praying at the specific time in question. Without considering these matters, neither the free exercise issue nor the officers’ entitlement to qualified immunity can be resolved. Thus, petitioner’s choice to abandon her Fourth Amendment claim on appeal did not obviate the need to address these matters.For these reasons, we grant the petition for a writ of certiorari; we reverse the judgment of the Tenth Circuit; and we remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered."}

Decided November 8, 2010Per Curiam.Federal courts may not issue writs of habeas corpus to state prisoners whose confinement does not violate federal law. Because the Court of Appeals granted the writ to respondent without finding such a violation, we vacate its judgment and remand.* * *In , respondent Joseph Corcoran shot and killed four men, including his brother and his sister’s fiancé. An Indiana jury found him guilty of four counts of murder, found the statutory aggravating circumstance of multiple murders, and unanimously recommended capital punishment. The trial judge agreed and sentenced respondent to death.But on appeal, the Supreme Court of Indiana vacated the sentence out of concern that the trial judge might have violated Indiana law by relying partly on nonstatutory aggravating factors when imposing the death penalty.Corcoranv.State, N. E. 2d , – (). When addressing respondent at sentencing, the trial court had remarked:“ ‘[T]he knowing and intentional murders of four innocent people is an extremely heinous and aggravated crime... . I don’t think in the history of this county we’ve had a mass murderer such as yourself. It makes you, Mr. Corcoran, a very dangerous, evil mass murderer. And I am convinced in my heart of hearts, ... if given the opportunity, you will murder again.’ ”Id., at (quoting transcript).According to the Indiana Supreme Court, the trial judge’s reference to the innocence of respondent’s victims, the heinousness of his offense, and his future dangerousness was not necessarily improper; it is permissible to provide “an appropriate context for consideration of the alleged aggravating and mitigating circumstances.”Ibid.(internal quotation marks omitted). But because the trial court might have meant that it weighed these factors as aggravating circumstances, the Indiana Supreme Court remanded for resentencing. Seeibid.On remand, the trial court issued a revised sentencing order. It wrote:“ ‘ The trial Court, in balancing the proved aggravators and mitigators, emphasizes to the Supreme Court that it only relied upon those proven statutory aggravators. The trial Court’s remarks at the sentencing hearing, and the language in the original sentencing order explain why such high weight was given to the statutory aggravator of multiple murder, and further support the trial Court’s personal conclusion that the sentence is appropriate punishment for this offender and these crimes.’ ”Corcoranv.State, N. E. 2d , (Ind. ) (quoting order).On appeal, over respondent’s objection, the Supreme Court accepted this explanation and affirmed the sentence.Id.,at –, . It explained that it was “now satisfied that the trial court has relied on only aggravators listed in Indiana Code §––2–9(b)... . There is no lack of clarity in [the trial court’s] statement and no plausible reason to believe it untrue.”Id.,at .Respondent later applied to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Indiana for a writ of habeas corpus. His habeas petition asserted a number of grounds for relief, including a renewed claim that, notwithstanding its assurances to the contrary, the trial court improperly relied on nonstatutory aggravating factors when it resentenced him. Respondent also asserted that this reliance violated the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. Record, Doc. , p. . In its response to the petition, the State specifically disputed that contention.Id., Doc. , p. (“[Respondent] fails to establish any constitutional deficiency in [the] Indiana Supreme Court’s review of the trial court’s treatment of Corcoran’s sentence on remand, let alone does it show that the state supreme court’s judgment is in any way inconsistent with applicable United States Supreme Court precedent”).The District Court, however, had no need to resolve this dispute because it granted habeas relief on a wholly different ground: that an offer by the prosecutor to take the death penalty off the table in exchange for a waiver of a jury trial had violated the Sixth Amendment.Corcoranv.Buss, F. Supp. 2d , – (). It did not address the sentencing challenge because that was “rendered moot” by the grant of habeas relief.Id.,at .The State appealed, and the Seventh Circuit reversed the District Court’s Sixth Amendment ruling.Corcoranv.Buss, F. 3d , , (). Then, evidently overlooking respondent’s remaining sentencing claims, the Seventh Circuit remanded the case to the District Court “with instructions to deny the writ.”Id., at . To correct this oversight, we granted certiorari and vacated the Seventh Circuit’s judgment.Corcoranv.Levenhagen, U. S. 1()(per curiam). We explained that the Court of Appeals “should have permitted the District Court to consider Corcoran’s unresolved challenges to his death sentence on remand, or should have itself explained why such consideration was unnecessary.”Id., at 2).On remand—and without any opportunity for briefing by the parties—the Court of Appeals changed course andgrantedhabeas relief.Corcoranv.Levenhagen, F. 3d , (). After determining that respondent’s sentencing challenge had been waived by his failure to include it in his original cross-appeal, the Seventh Circuit concluded that the claim satisfied plain-error review.Id.,at . The panel explained that, “unlike the Indiana Supreme Court,” it was unsatisfied with the trial court’s representation that it relied only on aggravating factors authorized by Indiana law.Ibid.Because the trial court’s revised sentencing order said that it used the nonstatutory factors of heinousness, victims’ innocence, and future dangerousness to determine the weight given to the aggravator of multiple murders, the Seventh Circuit concluded that the Indiana Supreme Court had made an “ ‘unreasonable determination of the facts’ ” when it accepted the trial court’s representation that it did not rely on those factors as aggravating circumstances.Ibid.(quoting U. S. C. §(d)(2)). The panel therefore required the Indiana trial court to reconsider its sentencing determination in order to “prevent non-compliance with Indiana law.” F. 3d, at –.But it is only noncompliance withfederallaw that renders a State’s criminal judgment susceptible to collateral attack in the federal courts. The habeas statute unambiguously provides that a federal court may issue the writ to a state prisoner “only on the ground that he is in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States.” U. S. C. §(a). And we have repeatedly held that “ ‘federal habeas corpus relief does not lie for errors of state law.’ ”Estellev.McGuire, U. S. , () (quotingLewisv.Jeffers, U. S. , ()). “[I]t is not the province of a federal habeas court to reexamine state-court determinations on state-law questions.” U. S., at –. But here, the panel’s opinion contained no hint that it thought the violation of Indiana law it had unearthed also entailed the infringement of any federal right. Not only did the court frame respondent’s claim as whether “the Indiana trial court considered non-statutory aggravating circumstances ... in contravention ofstate law,” F. 3d, at (emphasis added), it also explicitly acknowledged that “[n]othing in [its] opinion prevents Indiana from adopting a rule permitting the use of non-statutory aggravators in the death sentence selection process.See Zant v. Stephens, U. S. , () (permitting their use under federal law),”id., at – (citations omitted).Nor did it suffice for the Court of Appeals to find an unreasonable determination of the facts under U. S. C. §(d)(2). That provision allows habeas petitioners to avoid the bar to habeas relief imposed with respect to federal claims adjudicated on the merits in state court by showing that the state court’s decision was “based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.” It does not repeal the command of §(a) that habeas relief may be afforded to a state prisoner “only on the ground” that his custody violates federal law.In response to the Seventh Circuit’s opinion, the State filed a petition for rehearing and rehearing en banc. The State’s petition argued that the Seventh Circuit had erred by granting relief in the absence of a federal violation. It also contended, on the authority of our opinion inWainwrightv.Goode, U. S. ()(per curiam), that the Court of Appeals erred by second-guessing the Indiana Supreme Court’s factual determination that its own trial court complied with Indiana law.The Seventh Circuit denied rehearing, but amended its opinion to include this language:“This [remand for resentencing] will cure the state trial court’s ‘unreasonable determination of the facts.’ U. S. C. §(d)(1)[sic].(It will also prevent noncompliance with Indiana law. [Corcoran] contended that, under the circumstances of this case, noncompliance with state law also violates the federal Constitution and thus warrants him relief under U. S. C. §(d)(2). [The State] has not advanced any contrary argument based onWainwright v. Goode, U. S. (), or any similar decision.)” App. to Pet. for Cert. 144a–145a.The amendment did not cure the defect. It is not enough to note that a habeas petitionerassertsthe existence of a constitutional violation; unless the federal court agrees with that assertion, it may not grant relief. The Seventh Circuit’s opinion reflects no such agreement, nor does it even articulate what federal right was allegedly infringed. In fact, as to one possible federal claim, the court maintains that it wouldnotviolate federal law for Indiana to adopt a rule authorizing what the trial court did. F. 3d, at –.In lieu of finding or even describing a constitutional error, the amended opinion says only that the State had not “advanced any contrary argument based onWainwrightv.Goode... or any similar decision.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 145a. It is not clear what this language was meant to convey. It cannot have meant that the State forfeited the position that respondent’s allegations do not state a constitutional violation, since (as we observed) the State explicitly disputed that point before the District Court—the last forum in which the subject had been raised, leading the Court of Appeals to conclude thatrespondenthad waived the claim entirely. F. 3d, at . And there is no suggestion that the State has everconcededthe existence of a federal right to be sentenced in accordance with Indiana law. Under those circumstances, it was improper for the Court of Appeals to issue the writ without first concluding that a violation of federal law had been established.The petition for a writ of certiorari and respondent’s motion for leave to proceedin forma pauperisare granted. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. We express no view about the merits of the habeas petition.It is so ordered."}

GONZALEZ et al.on applications for stayNos. (–) and (–). Decided October , 2006Per Curiam.The State of Arizona and county officials from four of its counties seek relief from an interlocutory injunction entered by a two-judge motions panel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. [REDACTED] has referred the applicants’ filings to the Court. We construe the filings of the State and the county officials as petitions for certiorari; we grant the petitions; and we vacate the order of the Court of Appeals.IIn , Arizona voters approved Proposition . The measure sought to combat voter fraud by requiring voters to present proof of citizenship when they register to vote and to present identification when they vote on election day.The election procedures implemented to effect Proposition do not necessarily result in the turning away of qualified, registered voters by election officials for lack of proper identification. A voter who arrives at the polls on election day without identification may cast a conditional provisional ballot. For that ballot to be counted, the voter is allowed five business days to return to a designated site and present proper identification. In addition any voter who knows he or she cannot secure identification within five business days of the election has the option to vote before election day during the early voting period. The State has determined that, because there is adequate time during the early voting period to compare the voters’ signatures on the ballot with their signatures on the registration rolls, voters need not present identification if voting early.Arizona is a covered jurisdiction under §5 of the Voting Rights Act of . So it was required to preclear any new voting “standard, practice, or procedure” with either the United States Attorney General or the District Court for the District of Columbia to ensure its new voting policy did “not have the purpose [or] effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color,” U. S. C. §1973c. SeeGeorgiav.Ashcroft, U. S. , – (). On May 6, , the United States Attorney General precleared the procedures Arizona adopted under Proposition .In the District Court the plaintiffs in this action are residents of Arizona; Indian tribes; and various community organizations. In May , these plaintiffs brought suit challenging Proposition ’s identification requirements. On September , , the District Court denied their request for a preliminary injunction, but it did not at that time issue findings of fact or conclusions of law. These findings were important because resolution of legal questions in the Court of Appeals required evaluation of underlying factual issues.The plaintiffs appealed the denial, and the Clerk of the Court of Appeals set a briefing schedule that concluded on November , two weeks after the upcoming November 7 election. The plaintiffs then requested an injunction pending appeal from the Court of Appeals. Pursuant to the Court of Appeals’ rules, the request for an injunction was assigned to a two-judge motions/screening panel. See Rule 3–3 ( ). On October 5, after receiving lengthy written responses from the State and the county officials but without oral argument, the panel issued a four-sentence order enjoining Arizona from enforcing Proposition ’s provisions pending disposition, after full briefing, of the appeals of the denial of a preliminary injunction. The Court of Appeals offered no explanation or justification for its order. Four days later, the court denied a motion for reconsideration. The order denying the motion likewise gave no rationale for the court’s decision.Despite the time-sensitive nature of the proceedings and the pendency of a request for emergency relief in the Court of Appeals, the District Court did not issue its findings of fact and conclusions of law until October . It then concluded that “plaintiffs have shown a possibility of success on the merits of some of their arguments but the Court cannot say that at this stage they have shown a strong likelihood.” Order in NO. CV ––PHX–ROS etc. (D. Ariz., Oct. , ), pp. 7–8, App. to Application for Stay of Injunction, Tab 5 (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted). The District Court then found the balance of the harms and the public interest counseled in favor of denying the injunction.II“A State indisputably has a compelling interest in preserving the integrity of its election process.”Euv.San Francisco County Democratic Central Comm., U. S. , (). Confidence in the integrity of our electoral processes is essential to the functioning of our participatory democracy. Voter fraud drives honest citizens out of the democratic process and breeds distrust of our government. Voters who fear their legitimate votes will be outweighed by fraudulent ones will feel disenfranchised. “[T]he right of suffrage can be denied by a debasement or dilution of the weight of a citizen’s vote just as effectively as by wholly prohibiting the free exercise of the franchise.”Reynoldsv.Sims, U. S. , (). Countering the State’s compelling interest in preventing voter fraud is the plaintiffs’ strong interest in exercising the “fundamental political right” to vote.Dunnv.Blumstein, U. S. , () (internal quotation marks omitted). Although the likely effects of Proposition are much debated, the possibility that qualified voters might be turned away from the polls would caution any district judge to give careful consideration to the plaintiffs’ challenges.Faced with an application to enjoin operation of voter identification procedures just weeks before an election, the Court of Appeals was required to weigh, in addition to the harms attendant upon issuance or nonissuance of an injunction, considerations specific to election cases and its own institutional procedures. Court orders affecting elections, especially conflicting orders, can themselves result in voter confusion and consequent incentive to remain away from the polls. As an election draws closer, that risk will increase. So the Court of Appeals may have deemed this consideration to be grounds for prompt action. Furthermore, it might have given some weight to the possibility that the nonprevailing parties would want to seek en banc review. In the Ninth Circuit that procedure, involving voting by all active judges and an en banc hearing by a court of , can consume further valuable time. These considerations, however, cannot be controlling here. It was still necessary, as a procedural matter, for the Court of Appeals to give deference to the discretion of the District Court. We find no indication that it did so, and we conclude this was error.Although at the time the Court of Appeals issued its order the District Court had not yet made factual findings to which the Court of Appeals owed deference, see Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. (a), by failing to provide any factual findings or indeed any reasoning of its own the Court of Appeals left this Court in the position of evaluating the Court of Appeals’ bare order in light of the District Court’s ultimate findings. There has been no explanation given by the Court of Appeals showing the ruling and findings of the District Court to be incorrect. In view of the impending election, the necessity for clear guidance to the State of Arizona, and our conclusion regarding the Court of Appeals’ issuance of the order we vacate the order of the Court of Appeals.We underscore that we express no opinion here on the correct disposition, after full briefing and argument, of the appeals from the District Court’s September order or on the ultimate resolution of these cases. As we have noted, the facts in these cases are hotly contested, and “[n]o bright line separates permissible election-related regulation from unconstitutional infringements.”Timmonsv.Twin Cities Area New Party, U. S. , (). Given the imminence of the election and the inadequate time to resolve the factual disputes, our action today shall of necessity allow the election to proceed without an injunction suspending the voter identification rules.The order of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the cases are remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. Pursuant to this Court’s Rule .3, the Clerk is directed to issue the judgment in these cases forthwith.It is so ordered.[REDACTED], concurring.Allowing the election to proceed without enjoining the statutory provisions at issue will provide the courts with a better record on which to judge their constitutionality. At least two important factual issues remain largely unresolved: the scope of the disenfranchisement that the novel identification requirements will produce, and the prevalence and character of the fraudulent practices that allegedly justify those requirements. Given the importance of the constitutional issues, the Court wisely takes action that will enhance the likelihood that they will be resolved correctly on the basis of historical facts rather than speculation."}

Decided June , 2018Per Curiam.This appeal arises from a remedial redistricting order entered by the District Court in a racial gerrymandering case we have seen before. The case concerns the redistricting of state legislative districts by the North Carolina General Assembly in , in response to the census. A group of plaintiff voters, appellees here, alleged that the General Assembly racially gerrymandered their districts when—in an ostensible effort to comply with the requirements of the Voting Rights Act of —it drew State Senate and State House of Representatives districts comprising majorities of black voters. The District Court granted judgment to the plaintiffs, and we summarily affirmed that judgment. SeeCovingtonv.North Carolina, F. R. D. (MDNC ), summarily aff’d, U. S.At the same time, however, we vacated the District Court’s remedial order, which directed the General Assembly to adopt new districting maps, shortened by one year the terms of the legislators currently serving in the gerrymandered districts, called for special elections in those districts, and suspended two provisions of the North Carolina Constitution. SeeNorth Carolinav.Covington, U. S., at 1–2). The District Court ordered all of this, we noted, after undertaking only the “most cursory” review of the equitable balance involved in court-ordered special elections.Id., at 3). Having found that the District Court’s discretion “ ‘was barely exercised,’ ” we remanded the case for further remedial proceedings.Ibid.(quotingWinterv.Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., U. S. 7, ()).On remand, the District Court ordered the General Assembly to draw remedial maps for the State House and State Senate within a month, and to file those maps in the District Court for approval. The General Assembly complied after directing its map drawers to, among other things, make “[r]easonable efforts . . . to avoid pairing incumbent members of the House [and] Senate” and not to use “[d]ata identifying the race of individuals or voters” in the drawing of the new districts. F. Supp. 3d , – (MDNC ) (per curiam). The plaintiffs filed objections to the new maps. They argued that four legislative districts—Senate Districts and and House Districts and —still segregated voters on the basis of race. The plaintiffs also objected to the General Assembly’s decision to redraw five State House districts situated in Wake and Mecklenburg Counties. They argued that those five districts “did not violate the [U. S.] Constitution, [and] did not abut a district violating the [U. S.] Constitution.”Id.,at . Thus, they contended, the revision of the borders of those districts constituted mid-decade redistricting in violation of the North Carolina Constitution. See Art. II, §5(4);Granville County Commr’sv.Ballard, N. C. , – ().After some consideration of these objections, the District Court appointed a Special Master to redraw the lines of the districts to which the plaintiffs objected, along with any nonadjacent districts to the extent “necessary” to comply with districting criteria specified by the District Court. App. to Juris. Statement –. Those criteria included adherence to the “county groupings” used by the legislature in its remedial plan and to North Carolina’s “Whole County Provision as interpreted by the North Carolina Supreme Court.”Id.,at . The District Court further instructed the Special Master to make “reasonable efforts to adhere to . . . state policy objectives” by creating relatively compact districts and by avoiding split municipalities and precincts.Id.,at –. The District Court also permitted the Special Master to “adjust district lines to avoid pairing any incumbents who have not publicly announced their intention not to run in ” and to “consider data identifying the race of individuals or voters to the extent necessary to ensure that his plan cures the unconstitutional racial gerrymanders.”Id.,at –.Upon receipt of the Special Master’s report, the District Court sustained the plaintiffs’ objections and adopted the Special Master’s recommended reconfiguration of the state legislative maps. See F. Supp. 3d, at . With respect to Senate Districts and and House Districts and , the District Court found that those districts, as redrawn by the legislature, “retain[ed] the core shape” of districts that it had earlier found to be unconstitutional.Id.,at ; seeid.,at , , –. The District Court noted, for instance, that the legislature’s remedial plan for Senate District copied the prior plan’s “horseshoe-shaped section of the city of Fayetteville,” which “include[d] Fayetteville’s predominantly black [voting districts] and blocks and exclude[d] Fayetteville’s predominantly white [voting districts] and blocks.”Id.,at . Although the defendants explained that the new district was designed to “ ‘preserve the heart of Fayetteville,’ ” the District Court found that they had “fail[ed] to provide any explanation or evidence as to why ‘preserving the heart of Fayetteville’ required the exclusion of numerous majority-white precincts in downtown Fayetteville from the remedial district.”Ibid.(alterations omitted). Likewise, the District Court found that the legislature’s remedial version of Senate District , though it “encompasse[d] only a portion of [the city of] Greensboro,” nevertheless “encompasse[d]allof the majority black [voting districts] within Greensboro,” while “exclud[ing] predominantly white sections of Greensboro,” and “reach[ing] out of Greensboro’s city limits to capture predominantly African-American areas in eastern Guilford County.”Id.,at . By choosing to preserve the shape of the district’s “ ‘anchor’ ” in eastern Greensboro, the District Court found, the General Assembly had “ensured that the district would retain a high [black voting age population], thereby perpetuating the effects of the racial gerrymander.”Id.,at –.The District Court made similar findings with respect to the legislature’s remedial House Districts and . House District , it found, “(1) preserve[d] the core shape of . . . the previously unconstitutional district, (2) include[d] all but one of the majority-black [voting districts] in the two counties through which it [ran], (3) divide[d] a municipality and precinct along racial lines, [and] (4) ha[d] an irregular shape that corresponde[d] to the racial make-up of the geographic area.”Id.,at –. In light of this and other evidence, the District Court concluded that House District “continue[d] to be a racial gerrymander.”Id.,at . House District , the District Court found, likewise inexplicably “divide[d] the city of Greensboro along racial lines,”id.,at , and otherwise preserved features of the previously invalidated maps. The District Court thus concluded that the General Assembly’s remedial plans as to those districts were unconstitutional.Ibid.The District Court then sustained the plaintiffs’ remaining objection that several House districts in Wake and Mecklenburg Counties had been redrawn unnecessarily in violation of the North Carolina Constitution’s prohibition on mid-decade redistricting. Seeid.,at (citing Art. II, §5(4)). The court reasoned that the prohibition “preclude[d] the General Assembly from engaging in mid-decade redistricting” except to the extent “required by federal law or a judicial order.” F. Supp. 3d, at . It noted further that, “[w]hen a court must draw remedial districts itself, this means that a court may redraw only those districts necessary to remedy the constitutional violation,”ibid.(citingUphamv.Seamon, U. S. , – () (per curiam)), and that “Uphamrequires that a federal district court’s remedial order not unnecessarily interfere with state redistricting choices,” F. Supp. 3d, at . This remedial principle informed the District Court’s conclusion that “the General Assembly [had] exceeded its authority under [the District Court’s remedial] order by disregarding the mid-decade redistricting prohibition,” since the legislature had failed to “put forward any evidence showing that revisinganyof the five Wake and Mecklenburg County House districts challenged by Plaintiffs was necessary to remedy the racially gerrymandered districts in those two counties.”Id.,at .Finally, the District Court adopted the Special Master’s recommended replacement plans for the districts to which the plaintiffs had objected. In adopting those recommendations, the District Court turned away the defendants’ argument that they were built on “specific . . . quota[s]” of black voters in each reconstituted district.Id.,at –. The District Court instead credited the Special Master’s submission that his “ ‘remedial districts were drawn not with any racial target in mind, but in order to maximize compactness, preserve precinct boundaries, and respect political subdivision lines,’ ” and that the remedial map was the product of “ ‘explicitly race-neutral criteria.’ ”Id.,at . The District Court directed the defendants to implement the Special Master’s recommended district lines and to conduct elections accordingly.The defendants applied to this Court for a stay of the District Court’s order pending appeal. We granted a stay with respect to implementation of the Special Master’s remedial districts in Wake and Mecklenburg Counties, but otherwise denied the application. See U. S. The defendants timely appealed directly to this Court as provided under U. S. C. §. We have jurisdiction, and now summarily affirm in part and reverse in part the order of the District Court.* * *The defendants first argue that the District Court lacked jurisdiction even to enter a remedial order in this case. In their view, “[w]here, as here, a lawsuit challenges the validity of a statute,” the case becomes moot “when the statute is repealed.” Juris. Statement . Thus, according to the defendants, the plaintiffs’ racial gerrymandering claims ceased to exist when the North Carolina General Assembly enacted remedial plans for the State House and State Senate and repealed the old plans.The defendants misunderstand the nature of the plaintiffs’ claims. Those claims, like other racial gerrymandering claims, arise from the plaintiffs’ allegations that they have been “separate[d] . . . into different districts on the basis of race.”Shawv.Reno, U. S. , (). Resolution of such claims will usually turn upon “circumstantial evidence that race for its own sake, and not other districting principles, was the legislature’s dominant and controlling rationale in drawing” the lines of legislative districts.Millerv.Johnson, U. S. , (). But it is the segregation of the plaintiffs—not the legislature’s line-drawing as such—that gives rise to their claims. It is for this reason, among others, that the plaintiffs have standing to challenge racial gerrymanders only with respect to those legislative districts in which they reside. SeeAlabama Legislative Black Caucusv.Alabama, U. S., at 6). Here, in the remedial posture in which this case is presented, the plaintiffs’ claims that they were organized into legislative districts on the basis of their race did not become moot simply because the General Assembly drew new district lines around them. To the contrary, they argued in the District Court that some of the new districts were mere continuations of the old, gerrymandered districts. Because the plaintiffs asserted that they remained segre- gated on the basis of race, their claims remained the subject of a live dispute, and the District Court properly retained jurisdiction.Second, the defendants argue that the District Court erred when it “conclu[ded] that the General Assembly engaged in racial gerrymandering by declining to consider race.” Juris. Statement . They assert that “there is no dispute that the General Assembly didnotconsider raceat allwhen designing the [remedial plans]—not as a predominant motive, a secondary motive, or otherwise,” and that such “undisputed fact should have been the end of the plaintiffs’ racial gerrymandering challenges.”Id.,at –.This argument suffers from the same conceptual flaws as the first. While it may be undisputed that the legislature instructed its map drawers not to look at race when crafting a remedial map, what is also undisputed—because the defendants do not attempt to rebut it in their jurisdictional statement or in their brief opposing the plaintiffs’ motion to affirm—is the District Court’s detailed, district-by-district factfinding respecting the legislature’s remedial Senate Districts and and House Districts and .That factfinding, as discussed above, turned up sufficient circumstantial evidence that race was the predominant factor governing the shape of those four districts. See,e.g., F. Supp. 3d, at . As this Court has previously explained, a plaintiff can rely upon either “circumstantial evidence of a district’s shape and demographics or more direct evidence going to legislative purpose” in proving a racial gerrymandering claim.Miller,supra,at . The defendants’ insistence that the legislature did not look at racial data in drawing remedial districts does little to undermine the District Court’s conclusion—based on evidence concerning the shape and demographics of those districts—that the districts unconstitutionally sort voters on the basis of race. F. Supp. 3d, at .Third, the defendants argue that the District Court abused its discretion by arranging for the Special Master to draw up an alternative remedial map instead of giving the General Assembly—which “stood ready and willing to promptly carry out its sovereign duty”—another chance at a remedial map. Juris. Statement . Yet the District Court had its own duty to cure illegally gerrymandered districts through an orderly process in advance of elections. SeePurcellv.Gonzalez, U. S. 1, 4–5 () (per curiam). Here the District Court determined that “providing the General Assembly with a second bite at the apple” risked “further draw[ing] out these proceedings and potentially interfer[ing] with the election cycle.” F. Supp. 3d, at , n. . We conclude that the District Court’s appointment of a Special Master in this case was not an abuse of discretion.Neither was the District Court’s decision to adopt the Special Master’s recommended remedy for the racially gerrymandered districts. The defendants argue briefly that the District Court’s adoption of that recommendation was error because the Special Master’s remedial plan was “expressly race-conscious” and succeeded in “compel[ling] the State to employ racial quotas of plaintiffs’ choosing.” Juris. Statement –. Yet this Court has long recognized “[t]he distinction between being aware of racial considerations and being motivated by them.”Miller,supra, at . The District Court’s allowance that the Special Master could “consider data identifying the race of individuals or voters to the extent necessary to ensure that his plan cures the unconstitutional racial gerrymanders,” App. to Juris. Statement , does not amount to a warrant for “racial quotas.” In any event, the defendants’ assertions on this question make no real attempt to counter the District Court’s agreement with the Special Master that “ ‘no racial targets were sought or achieved’ ” in drawing the remedial districts. F. Supp. 3d, at .All of the foregoing is enough to convince us that the District Court’s order should be affirmed insofar as it provided a court-drawn remedy for Senate Districts and and House Districts and . The same cannot be said, however, of the District Court’s actions concerning the legislature’s redrawing of House districts in Wake and Mecklenburg Counties. There the District Court proceeded from a mistaken view of its adjudicative role and its relationship to the North Carolina General Assembly.The only injuries the plaintiffs established in this case were that they had been placed in their legislative districts on the basis of race. The District Court’s remedial authority was accordingly limited to ensuring that the plaintiffs were relieved of the burden of voting in racially gerrymandered legislative districts. SeeDaimlerChrysler Corp.v.Cuno, U. S. , (). But the District Court’s revision of the House districts in Wake and Mecklenburg Counties had nothing to do with that. Instead, the District Court redrew those districts because it found that the legislature’s revision of them violated the North Carolina Constitution’s ban on mid-decade redistricting, not federal law. Indeed, the District Court understood that ban to apply unless such redistricting was “required by federal law or judicial order.” F. Supp. 3d, at . The District Court’s enforcement of the ban was thus premised on the conclusion that the General Assembly’s action was not “required” by federal law.The District Court’s decision to override the legislature’s remedial map on that basis was clear error. “[S]tate legislatures have primary jurisdiction over legislative reapportionment,”Whitev.Weiser, U. S. , () (internal quotation marks omitted), and a legislature’s “freedom of choice to devise substitutes for an apportionment plan found unconstitutional, either as a whole or in part, should not be restricted beyond the clear commands” of federal law,Burnsv.Richardson, U. S. , (). A district court is “not free . . . to disregard the political program of” a state legislature on other bases.Upham, U. S., at . Once the District Court had ensured that the racial gerrymanders at issue in this case were remedied, its proper role in North Carolina’s legislative districting process was at an end.The order of the District Court is affirmed in part and reversed in part.It is so ordered."}

(The Government appears to emphasize certain materials in categories 2, 3, and 4.) Under the specific facts of this case, the District Court should have granted respondents’ motion on November to stay implementation of the challenged October order and first resolved the Government’s threshold arguments (that the Acting Secretary’s determination to rescind DACA is unreviewable because it is “committed to agency discretion,” 5 U.

Either of those arguments, if accepted, likely would eliminate the need for the District Court to examine a complete administrative record.On remand of the case, the Court of Appeals shall take appropriate action so that the following steps can betaken. The District Court should proceed to rule on the Government’s threshold arguments and, in doing so, may consider certifying that ruling for interlocutory appeal under U. S. C. §(b) if appropriate.

Decided February , 2020Per Curiam.In , the Office of the Superintendent of Catholic Schools of the Archdiocese of San Juan created a trust to administer a pension plan for employees of Catholic schools, aptly named the Pension Plan for Employees of Catholic Schools Trust (Trust). Among the participating schools were Perpetuo Socorro Academy, San Ignacio de Loyola Academy, and San Jose Academy.In , active and retired employees of the academies filed complaints in the Puerto Rico Court of First Instance alleging that the Trust had terminated the plan, eliminating the employees’ pension benefits. The employees named as a defendant the “Roman Catholic and Apostolic Church of Puerto Rico,” which the employees claimed was a legal entity with supervisory authority over all Catholic institutions in Puerto Rico. App. to Pet. for Cert. –, – (emphasis deleted).[1] The employees also named as defendants the Archdiocese of San Juan, the Superintendent, the three academies, and the Trust.The Court of First Instance, in an order affirmed by the Puerto Rico Court of Appeals, denied a preliminary injunction requiring the payment of benefits, but the Puerto Rico Supreme Court reversed. The Supreme Court concluded that “if the Trust did not have the necessary funds to meet its obligations, the participating employers would be obligated to pay.”Id., at 3. But, because “there was a dispute as to which defendants in the case had legal personalities,” the Supreme Court remanded the case to the Court of First Instance to “determine who would be responsible for continuing paying the pensions, pursuant to the preliminary injunction.”Ibid.The Court of First Instance determined that the “Roman Catholic and Apostolic Church in Puerto Rico” was the only defendant with separate legal personhood.Id., at –. The Court held such personhood existed by virtue of the Treaty of Paris of , through which Spain ceded Puerto Rico to the United States. The Court found that the Archdiocese of San Juan, the Superintendent, and the academies each constituted a “division or dependency” of the Church, because those entities were not separately incorporated.Ibid.As a result, the Court of First Instance ordered the “Roman Catholic and Apostolic Church in Puerto Rico” to make payments to the employees in accordance with the pension plan.Id., at . Ten days later, the Court issued a second order requiring the Church to deposit $4.7 million in a court account within hours. The next day, the Court issued a third order, requiring the sheriff to “seize assets and moneys of . . . the Holy Roman Catholic and Apostolic Church, and any of its dependencies, that are located in Puerto Rico.”Id., at .The Puerto Rico Court of Appeals reversed. It held that the “Roman Catholic and Apostolic Church in Puerto Rico” was a “legally nonexistent entity.”Id., at . But, the Court concluded, the Archdiocese of San Juan and the Perpetuo Socorro Academy could be ordered to make contribution payments. The Archdiocese enjoyed separate legal personhood as the effective successor to the Roman Catholic Church in Puerto Rico, the entity recognized by the Treaty of Paris. Perpetuo Socorro Academy likewise constituted a separate legal person because it had been incorporated in accordance with Puerto Rico law, even though its registration was not active in , when the orders were issued. The two remaining academies, San Ignacio Academy and San Jose Academy, were part of the same legal entity as “their respective parishes,” but the employees could not obtain relief against the parishes because they had not been named as defendants.Id., at .The Puerto Rico Supreme Court again reversed, reinstating the preliminary injunction issued by the trial court. The Supreme Court first held that the “relationship between Spain, the Catholic Church, and Puerto Rico issui generis, given the particularities of its development and historical context.”Id., at 5. The Court explained that the Treaty of Paris recognized the “legal personality” of “the Catholic Church” in Puerto Rico.Id., at 6.The Puerto Rico Supreme Court further observed that “each entity created that operates separately and with a certain degree of autonomy from the Catholic Church is in reality a fragment of only one entity that possesses legal personality,” at least where the entities have not “independently submitt[ed] to an ordinary incorporation process.”Id., at – (emphasis deleted). “In other words,” the Court continued, “the entities created as a result of any internal configuration of the Catholic Church,” such as the Archdiocese of San Juan, “are not automatically equivalent to the formation of entities with different and separate legal personalities in the field of Civil Law,” but “are merely indivisible fragments of the legal personality that the Catholic Church has.”Ibid.And Perpetuo Socorro Academy was not a registered corporation in , when the plan was terminated.Id., at . Therefore, under the Court’s reasoning, the only defendant with separate legal personality, and the only entity that could be ordered to pay the employees’ pensions, was the “Roman Catholic and Apostolic Church in Puerto Rico.”Id., at 2.Two Justices dissented. [REDACTED] Rodríguez criticized the majority for “inappropriately interfer[ing] with the operation of the Catholic Church by imposing on it a legal personality that it does not hold in the field of private law.”Id., at . In her view, the Archdiocese of San Juan and the five other dioceses in Puerto Rico each has its own “independent legal personality.”Id., at . [REDACTED] Pérez likewise determined that, under Puerto Rico law, “each Diocese and the Archdiocese ha[s its] own legal personality” and that no separate “legal personality” called the “Roman Catholic and Apostolic Church” exists.Id., at , (emphasis deleted).The Archdiocese petitioned this Court for a writ of certiorari. The Archdiocese argues that the Free Exercise and Establishment Clauses of the First Amendment require courts to defer to “the Church’s own views on how the Church is structured.” Pet. for Cert. 1. Thus, in this case, the courts must follow the Church’s lead in recognizing the separate legal personalities of each diocese and parish in Puerto Rico. The Archdiocese claims that the Puerto Rico Supreme Court decision violated the “religious autonomy doctrine,” which provides: “[W]henever the questions of discipline, or of faith, or ecclesiastical rule, custom, or law have been decided by the highest of these church judicatories to which the matter has been carried, the legal tribunals must accept such decisions as final, and as binding on them, in their application to the case before them.”Id., at (quotingWatsonv.Jones, Wall. , ()).We called for the Solicitor General’s views on the petition. U. S. The Solicitor General argues that we need not “reach [the Archdiocese’s] broader theory in order to properly dispose of this case,” because a different error warrants vacatur and remand. Brief for United States asAmicus Curiaeon Pet. for Cert. – (Brief for United States). Instead of citing “any neutral rule of Puerto Rico law governing corporations, incorporated or unincorporated associations, veil-piercing, joint-and-several liability, or vicarious liability,” the Puerto Rico Supreme Court “relied on a special presumption—seemingly applicable only to the Catholic Church . . . —that all Catholic entities on the Island are ‘merely indivisible fragments of the legal personality that the Catholic Church has.’ ”Id., at 9 (quoting App. to Pet. for Cert. ). The Solicitor General contends that the Puerto Rico Supreme Court thus violated the fundamental tenet of the Free Exercise Clause that a government may not “single out an individual religious denomination or religious belief for discriminatory treatment.” Brief for United States 8 (citingMurphyv.Collier, U. S.v.Hialeah, U.S. , – ();Fowlerv.Rhode Island, U.S. , ()).We do not reach either argument because we find that the Court of First Instance lacked jurisdiction to issue the payment and seizure orders. On February 6, , after the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico remanded the case to the Court of First Instance to determine the appropriate parties to the preliminary injunction, the Archdiocese removed the case to the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico. Notice of Removal inAcevedo-Felicianov.Holy Catholic Church, No. 3:–cv–. The Archdiocese argued that the Trust had filed for Chapter bankruptcy and that this litigation was sufficiently related to the bankruptcy to give rise to federal jurisdiction.Id., at 5–6 (citing U.

See also 14C C. Wright, A. Miller, E. Cooper, J. Steinman, & M. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure §, pp. – ().The Court of First Instance issued its payment and seizure orders after the proceeding was removed to federal district court, but before the federal court remanded the proceeding back to the Puerto Rico court. At that time, the Court of First Instance had no jurisdiction over the proceeding. The orders are therefore void.We note two possible rejoinders. First, the Puerto Rico Court of Appeals suggested that the Archdiocese consented to the Court of First Instance’s jurisdiction by filing motions in that court after removal. But we have held that a removing party’s right to a federal forum becomes “fixed” upon filing of a notice of removal, and that if the removing party’s “right to removal [is] ignored by the State court,” the party may “make defence in that tribunal in every mode recognized by the laws of the State, without forfeiting or impairing, in the slightest degree, its right to a trial” in federal court.Steamship Co., U. S., at –. Such actions do not “restore[ ]” “the jurisdiction of the State court.”Id., at . So, too, the Archdiocese’s motions did not restore jurisdiction to the Court of First Instance.Second, the District Court remanded the case to the Court of First Instance by way of anunc pro tuncjudgment stating that the order “shall be effective as of March , ,” the date that the Trust’s bankruptcy proceeding was dismissed.Nunc Pro TuncJudgt. in No. 3:–cv– (Aug. 8, ).Federal courts may issuenunc pro tuncorders, or “now for then” orders, Black’s Law Dictionary, at , to “reflect[ ] the reality” of what has already occurred,Missouriv.Jenkins, U.S. , (). “Such a decree presupposes a decree allowed, or ordered, but not entered, through inadvertence of the court.”Cuebas y Arredondov.Cuebas y Arredondo, U.S. ,().Put colorfully, “[n]unc pro tunc orders are not some Orwellian vehicle for revisionist history—creating ‘facts’ that never occurred in fact.”United Statesv.Gillespie, F. Supp. , (ND Ill. ). Put plainly, the court “cannot make the record what it is not.”Jenkins, U. S., at .Nothing occurred in the District Court case on March , . See Order Granting Motion to Remand in No. 3:–cv– (noting, on August , , that the motion is “hereby” granted and ordering judgment “accordingly”). March was when the Bankruptcy Court dismissed the Trust’s proceeding and thus the day that the Archdiocese’s argument for federal jurisdiction lost its persuasive force. Even so, the case remained in federal court until that court, on August , reached a decision about the motion to remand that was pending before it. The Court of First Instance’s actions in the interim, including the payment and seizure orders, are void.The Solicitor General agrees that the Court of First Instance lacked jurisdiction but argues that this defect does not prevent us from addressing additional errors, including those asserted under the Free Exercise Clause. That may be correct, given that the Puerto Rico courts do not exercise Article III jurisdiction. But we think the preferable course at this point is to remand the case to the Puerto Rico courts to consider how to proceed in light of the jurisdictional defect we have identified.The petition for certiorari and the motions for leave to file briefsamici curiaeare granted, the judgment of the Puerto Rico Supreme Court is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.Notes1The petition for a writ of certiorari includes certified translations of the opinions, originally in Spanish, of the Puerto Rico courts.

Decided January , 2016Per Curiam.The Court considers for the second time the Ninth Circuit’s determination that respondent stockholders’ complaint states a claim against petitioner fiduciaries for breach of the duty of prudence. The first time, the Court vacated and remanded in light ofFifth Third Bancorpv.Dudenhoeffer, U. S. On remand, the Ninth Circuit reiterated its conclusion that the complaint states such a claim. The Court now reverses and remands.The stockholders are former employees of Amgen Inc. and its subsidiary Amgen Manufacturing, Limited, who participated in plans that qualified under U. S. C. §(d)(3)(A) as eligible individual account plans. Like ESOPs, these plans offer ownership in employer stock as an option to employees. The parties agree that the decision inFifth Thirdis fully applicable to the plans at issue here. See F. 3d , ().All of the plans had holdings in the Amgen Common Stock Fund (composed, unsurprisingly, of Amgen common stock) during the relevant period. The value of Amgen stock fell, and in , the stockholders filed a class action against petitioner fiduciaries alleging that they had breached their fiduciary duties, including the duty of prudence, under the Employee Retirement Income Secur-ity Act of (ERISA), 88Stat. , as amended, U. S. C. §1001et seq.The District Court granted the fiduciaries’ motion to dismiss, and the Ninth Circuit reversed,Harrisv.Amgen, Inc., F. 3d (). The fiduciaries sought certiorari.While that petition was pending, this Court issued a decision that concerned the duty of prudence owed by ERISA fiduciaries who administer ESOPs. That decision,Fifth Third, held that such ERISA fiduciaries are not entitled to a presumption of prudence but are “subject to the same duty of prudence that applies to ERISA fiduciaries in general, except that they need not diversify the fund’s assets.” U. S., at 1–2).Notwithstanding the lack of a presumption of prudence,Fifth Thirdnoted that “Congress sought to encourage the creation of” employee stock-ownership plans,id., at ), a purpose that the decision recognized may come into tension with ERISA’s general duty of prudence. Moreover, ESOP fiduciaries confront unique challenges given “the potential for conflict” that arises when fiduciaries are alleged to have imprudently “fail[ed] to act on inside information they had about the value of the employer’s stock.”Id., at ).Fifth Thirdtherefore laid out standards to help “divide the plausible sheep from the meritless goats,”id., at ):“To state a claim for breach of the duty of prudence on the basis of inside information, a plaintiff must plausibly allege an alternative action that the defendant could have taken that would have been consistent with the securities laws and that a prudent fiduciary in the same circumstances would not have viewed as more likely to harm the fund than to help it.”Id., at ).It further clarified that courts should determine whether the complaint itself states a claim satisfying that liability standard:“[L]ower courts faced with such claims should also considerwhether the complaint has plausibly allegedthat a prudent fiduciary in the defendant’s position could not have concluded that stopping purchases—which the market might take as a sign that insider fiduciaries viewed the employer’s stock as a bad investment—or publicly disclosing negative information would do more harm than good to the fund by causing a drop in the stock price and a concomitant drop in the value of the stock already held by the fund.”Id., at ) (emphasis added).In the matter that is once again before the Court here, following the issuance ofFifth Third, the Court granted the fiduciaries’ first petition for a writ of certiorari, va-cated the judgment, and remanded for further proceedings consistent with that decision.Amgen Inc.v.Harris, U. S. On remand, the Ninth Circuit reversed again the dismissal of the complaint and denied the fiduciaries’ petition for rehearing en banc. See F. 3d . The fiduciaries once more sought certiorari.The Court now holds that the Ninth Circuit failed to properly evaluate the complaint. That court explained that its previous opinion (that is, the one it issued beforeFifth Thirdwas decided) “had already assumed” the standards for ERISA fiduciary liability laid out by this Court inFifth Third. F. 3d, at . And it reasoned that the complaint at issue here satisfies those standards because when “the federal securities laws require disclosure of material information,” it is “quite plausible” that removing the Amgen Common Stock Fund “from the list of investment options” would not “caus[e] undue harm to plan participants.”Id.,at –. The Ninth Circuit, however, failed to assess whether the complaint in its current form “has plausibly alleged” that a prudent fiduciary in the same position “could not have concluded” that the alternative action “would do more harm than good., at ).The Ninth Circuit’s proposition that removing the Amgen Common Stock Fund from the list of investment options was an alternative action that could plausibly have satisfiedFifth Third’s standards may be true. If so, the facts and allegations supporting that proposition should appear in the stockholders’ complaint. Having examined the complaint, the Court has not found sufficient facts and allegations to state a claim for breach of the duty of prudence.Although the Ninth Circuit did not correctly applyFifth Third, the stockholders are the masters of their complaint. The Court leaves to the District Court in the first instance whether the stockholders may amend it in order to adequately plead a claim for breach of the duty of prudence guided by the standards provided inFifth Third.The petition for certiorari is granted. The judgment of the Ninth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered."}

When the officers arrived at the school, the principal informed them that a stu- dent, Vincent Huff, was rumored to have written a letter threatening to “shoot up” the school. App. to Pet. for Cert. 2. The principal reported that many parents, after hearing the rumor, had decided to keep their children at home. Ibid. The principal expressed concern for the safety of her students and requested that the officers investigate the threat. Id., at , –.In the course of conducting interviews with the principal and two of Vincent’s classmates, the officers learned that Vincent had been absent from school for two days and that he was frequently subjected to bullying. Id., at 2. The officers additionally learned that one of Vincent’s classmates believed that Vincent was capable of carrying out the alleged threat. Id., at . The officers found Vincent’s absences from school and his history of being subjected to bullying as cause for concern. The officers had received training on targeted school violence and were aware that these characteristics are common among perpetrators of school shootings. Id., at –, .The officers decided to continue the investigation by interviewing Vincent. When the officers arrived at Vincent’s house, Officer Zepeda knocked on the door and announced several times that the officers were with the Burbank Police Department. No one answered the door or otherwise responded to Officer Zepeda’s knocks. Sergeant Ryburn then called the home telephone. The officers could hear the phone ringing inside the house, but no one answered. Id., at 2.Sergeant Ryburn next tried calling the cell phone of Vincent’s mother, Mrs. Huff. When Mrs. Huff answered the phone, Sergeant Ryburn identified himself and inquired about her location. Mrs. Huff informed Sergeant Ryburn that she was inside the house. Sergeant Ryburn then inquired about Vincent’s location, and Mrs. Huff informed him that Vincent was inside with her. Sergeant Ryburn told Mrs. Huff that he and the other officers were outside and requested to speak with her, but Mrs. Huff hung up the phone. Id., at 2–3.One or two minutes later, Mrs. Huff and Vincent walked out of the house and stood on the front steps. Officer Zepeda advised Vincent that he and the other officers were there to discuss the threats. Vincent, apparently aware of the rumor that was circulating at his school, responded, “I can’t believe you’re here for that.” Id., at 3. Sergeant Ryburn asked Mrs. Huff if they could continue the discussion inside the house, but she refused. Ibid. In Sergeant Ryburn’s experience as a juvenile bureau sergeant, it was “extremely unusual” for a parent to decline an officer’s request to interview a juvenile inside. Id., at 3, –. Sergeant Ryburn also found it odd that Mrs. Huff never asked the officers the reason for their visit. Id., at –.After Mrs. Huff declined Sergeant Ryburn’s request to continue the discussion inside, Sergeant Ryburn asked her if there were any guns in the house. Mrs. Huff responded by “immediately turn[ing] around and r[unning] into the house.” Id., at 3. Sergeant Ryburn, who was “scared because [he] didn’t know what was in that house” and had “seen too many officers killed,” entered the house behind her. Id., at . Vincent entered the house behind Sergeant Ryburn, and Officer Zepeda entered after Vincent. Officer Zepeda was concerned about “officer safety” and did not want Sergeant Ryburn to enter the house alone. Id., at 3. The two remaining officers, who had been standing out of earshot while Sergeant Ryburn and Officer Zepeda talked to Vincent and Mrs. Huff, entered the house last, on the assumption that Mrs. Huff had given Sergeant Ryburn and Officer Zepeda permission to enter. Id., at 3–4.Upon entering the house, the officers remained in the living room with Mrs. Huff and Vincent. Eventually, Vincent’s father entered the room and challenged the officers’ authority to be there. The officers remained in-side the house for a total of 5 to minutes. During that time, the officers talked to Mr. Huff and Vincent. They did not conduct any search of Mr. Huff, Mrs. Huff, or Vincent, or any of their property. The officers ultimately concluded that the rumor about Vincent was false, and they reported their conclusion to the school. Id., at 4.The Huffs brought this action against the officers under Rev. Stat. §, U. S. C. §. The complaint alleges that the officers violated the Huffs’ Fourth Amendment rights by entering their home without a warrant. Following a 2-day bench trial, the District Court entered judgment in favor of the officers. The District Court resolved conflicting testimony regarding Mrs. Huff’s response to Sergeant Ryburn’s inquiry about guns by finding that Mrs. Huff “immediately turned around and ran into the house.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 3. The District Court concluded that the officers were entitled to qualified immunity because Mrs. Huff’s odd behavior, combined with the information the officers gathered at the school, could have led reason-able officers to believe “that there could be weapons inside the house, and that family members or the officers themselves were in danger.” Id., at 6. The District Court noted that “[w]ithin a very short period of time, the officers were confronted with facts and circumstances giving rise to grave concern about the nature of the danger they were confronting.” Id., at 6–7. With respect to this kind of “rapidly evolving incident,” the District Court explained, courts should be especially reluctant “to fault the police for not obtaining a warrant.” Id., at 7.A divided panel of the Ninth Circuit affirmed the District Court as to the two officers who entered the house on the assumption that Mrs. Huff had consented, but reversed as to petitioners. The majority upheld the District Court’s findings of fact, but disagreed with the District Court’s conclusion that petitioners were entitled to qualified immunity. The majority acknowledged that police officers are allowed to enter a home without a warrant if they reasonably believe that immediate entry is necessary to protect themselves or others from serious harm, even if the officers lack probable cause to believe that a crime has been or is about to be committed.

But the majority determined that, in this case, “any belief that the officers or other family members were in serious, im-minent harm would have been objectively unreasonable” given that “[Mrs. Huff] merely asserted her right to end her conversation with the officers and returned to her home.” Id., at .Judge Rawlinson dissented. She explained that “the discrete incident that precipitated the entry in this case was Mrs. Huff’s response to the question regarding whether there were guns in the house.” Id., at . She faulted the majority for “recit[ing] a sanitized account of this event” that differed markedly from the District Court’s findings of fact, which the majority had conceded must be credited. Judge Rawlinson looked to “cases that specifi- cally address the scenario where officer safety concerns prompted the entry” and concluded that, under the rationale articulated in those cases, “a police officer could have reasonably believed that he was justified in making a warrantless entry to ensure that no one inside the house had a gun after Mrs. Huff ran into the house without answering the question of whether anyone had a weapon.” Id., at , , .Judge Rawlinson’s analysis of the qualified immunity issue was correct. No decision of this Court has found a Fourth Amendment violation on facts even roughly comparable to those present in this case. On the contrary, some of our opinions may be read as pointing in the opposition direction.In Brigham City v. Stuart, U.S. , () , we held that officers may enter a residence without a warrant when they have “an objectively reasonable basis for believing that an occupant is . . . imminently threatened with [serious injury].” We explained that “ ‘[t]he need to protect or preserve life or avoid serious injury is justification for what would be otherwise illegal absent an exigency or emergency.’ ” Id., at (quoting Mincey v. Arizona, U.S. , () ). In addition, in Georgia v. Randolph, U.S. , () , the Court stated that “it would be silly to suggest that the police would commit a tort by entering [a residence] . . . to determine whether violence . . . is about to (or soon will) occur.”A reasonable police officer could read these decisions to mean that the Fourth Amendment permits an officer to en- ter a residence if the officer has a reasonable basis for concluding that there is an imminent threat of violence. In this case, the District Court concluded that petitioners had such an objectively reasonable basis for reaching such a conclusion. The District Court wrote:“[T]he officers testified that a number of factors led them to be concerned for their own safety and for the safety of other persons in the residence: the unusual behavior of the parents in not answering the door or the telephone; the fact that Mrs. Huff did not inquire about the reason for their visit or express concern that they were investigating her son; the fact that she hung up the telephone on the officer; the fact that she refused to tell them whether there were guns in the house; and finally, the fact that she ran back into the house while being questioned. That behavior, combined with the information obtained at the school—that Vincent was a student who was a victim of bullying, who had been absent from school for two days, and who had threatened to ‘shoot up’ the school—led the officers to believe that there could be weapons inside the house, and that family members or the officers themselves were in danger.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 6.This belief, the District Court held, was “objectively reasonable,” particularly since the situation was “rapidly evolving” and the officers had to make quick decisions. Id., at 6–7.The panel majority—far removed from the scene and with the opportunity to dissect the elements of the situation—confidently concluded that the officers really had no reason to fear for their safety or that of anyone else. As the panel majority saw things, it was irrelevant that the Huffs did not respond when the officers knocked on the door and announced their presence and when they called the home phone because the Huffs had no legal obligation to respond to a knock on the door or to answer the phone. The majority attributed no significance to the fact that, when the officers finally reached Mrs. Huff on her cell phone, she abruptly hung up in the middle of their conversation. And, according to the majority, the officers should not have been concerned by Mrs. Huff’s reaction when they asked her if there were any guns in the house because Mrs. Huff “merely asserted her right to end her conversation with the officers and returned to her home.” Id., at .Confronted with the facts found by the District Court, reasonable officers in the position of petitioners could have come to the conclusion that there was an imminent threat to their safety and to the safety of others. The Ninth Circuit’s contrary conclusion was flawed for numerous reasons.First, although the panel majority purported to accept the findings of the District Court, it changed those findings in several key respects. As Judge Rawlinson correctly observed, “the discrete incident that precipitated the entry in this case was Mrs. Huff’s response to the question regarding whether there were guns in the house.” Id., at . The District Court’s finding that Mrs. Huff “immediately turned around and ran into the house” implicitly rejected Mrs. Huff’s contrary testimony that she walked into the house after telling the officers that she was going to get her husband. Id., at 3. The panel majority upheld the District Court’s findings of fact and acknowledged that it could not reverse the District Court simply because it “may have weighed the testimony of the witnesses and other evidence in another manner.” Id., at . But the panel majority’s determination that petitioners were not entitled to qualified immunity rested on an account of the facts that differed markedly from the District Court’s finding. According to the panel majority, Mrs. Huff “merely asserted her right to end her conversation with the officers and returned to her home” after telling the officers “that she would go get her husband.” Id., at , .Second, the panel majority appears to have taken the view that conduct cannot be regarded as a matter of concern so long as it is lawful. Accordingly, the panel ma- jority concluded that Mrs. Huff’s response to the question whether there were any guns in the house (immediately turning around and running inside) was not a reason for alarm because she was under no legal obligation to continue her conversation with the police. It should go without saying, however, that there are many circumstances in which lawful conduct may portend imminent violence.Third, the panel majority’s method of analyzing the string of events that unfolded at the Huff residence was entirely unrealistic. The majority looked at each separate event in isolation and concluded that each, in itself, did not give cause for concern. But it is a matter of common sense that a combination of events each of which is mundane when viewed in isolation may paint an alarming picture.Fourth, the panel majority did not heed the District Court’s wise admonition that judges should be cautious about second-guessing a police officer’s assessment, made on the scene, of the danger presented by a particular situation. With the benefit of hindsight and calm deliberation, the panel majority concluded that it was unreasonable for petitioners to fear that violence was imminent. But we have instructed that reasonableness “must be judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, rather than with the / vision of hindsight” and that “[t]he calculus of reasonableness must embody allowance for the fact that police officers are often forced to make split-second judgments—in circumstances that are tense, uncertain, and rapidly evolving.” Graham v. Connor, U.S. – (). Judged from the proper perspective of a reasonable officer forced to make a split-second decision in response to a rapidly unfolding chain of events that culminated with Mrs. Huff turning and running into the house after refusing to answer a question about guns, petitioners’ belief that entry was necessary to avoid injury to themselves or others was im- minently reasonable.In sum, reasonable police officers in petitioners’ position could have come to the conclusion that the Fourth Amendment permitted them to enter the Huff residence if there was an objectively reasonable basis for fearing that violence was imminent. And a reasonable officer could have come to such a conclusion based on the facts as found by the District Court.The petition for certiorari is granted, the judgment of the Ninth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for the entry of judgment in favor of petitioners.It is so ordered."}

S., APPELLANTSv.GIGI DENNIS, COLORADO SECRETARY OF STATEon appeal from the united states district court for the district of coloradoNo. –. Decided February , 2006Per Curiam.TheRooker-Feldmandoctrine prevents the lower federal courts from exercising jurisdiction over cases brought by “state-court losers” challenging “state-court judgments rendered before the district court proceedings commenced.”Exxon Mobil Corp.v.Saudi Basic Industries Corp., U. S. , (). In this case, the District Court dismissed plaintiffs’ suit on the ground that they were in privity with a state-court loser. We hold that theRooker-Feldmandoctrine does not bar plaintiffs from proceeding, and vacate the District Court’s judgment.IThis is the latest of several rounds of litigation involving the State of Colorado’s congressional redistricting after the census, under which the State gained a seat in the House of Representatives.Lancev.Davidson, F. Supp. 2d , (). The first round began in May . When the Colorado General Assembly failed to pass a redistricting plan for the congressional elections by the close of its regular session, a group of Colorado voters asked the state courts to create a plan. The courts agreed, drawing a new map reflecting the additional district. SeeBeauprezv.Avalos, P. 3d (Colo. ) (en banc). The elections were held using this court-ordered plan.The General Assembly passed its own redistricting plan in the spring of , prompting further litigation—this time about which electoral map was to govern, the legislature’s or the court’s. Two suits were filed seeking to enjoin the legislature’s plan: an original action in the Colorado Supreme Court by the state attorney general seeking to require the secretary of state to use the court-ordered plan, and a similar action brought in a lower state court by several proponents of the court-ordered plan. F. Supp. 2d, at . After the Colorado General Assembly intervened to defend its plan in the first case, the Colorado Supreme Court held that the plan violated Article V, §, of the State Constitution, which the court construed to limit congressional redistricting to “once per decade.”People ex rel. Salazarv.Davidson, P. 3d , () (en banc). It therefore ordered the secretary of state to use the court-created plan. We denied certiorari. U. S. ().The second suit was removed to federal court by the defendants on the basis of plaintiffs’ federal-law claims. SeeKellerv.Davidson, F. Supp. 2d , (Colo. ). OnceSalazarwas decided by the Colorado Supreme Court, the viability of the defendants’ counterclaims was the only remaining issue. A three-judge District Court held that the defendants were barred by theRooker-Feldmandoctrine from amending their counterclaims to assert additional challenges to the decision inSalazar. It also held that the defendants’ original counterclaims, while not barred by theRooker-Feldmandoctrine, were precluded under Colorado law by the judgment inSalazar. Accordingly, the court dismissed the case.Finally, this suit: Before the dismissal inKeller, several Colorado citizens unhappy withSalazarfiled an action in the District Court seeking to require the secretary of state to use the legislature’s plan.[Footnote 1] The plaintiffs argued that Article V, §, of the Colorado Constitution, as interpreted by the Colorado Supreme Court, violated the Elections Clause of Article I, §4, of the U. S. Constitution (“The Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof”), and the First Amendment’s Petition Clause (“Congress shall make no law ... abridging ... the right of the people ... to petition the Government for a redress of grievances”). The defendants filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that theRooker-Feldmandoctrine and Colorado preclusion law barred any attack on the Colorado Supreme Court’s judgment inSalazarand that the plaintiffs had failed to state a valid Petition Clause claim.The three-judge District Court ruled that under theRooker-Feldmandoctrine, it had no jurisdiction to hear the Elections Clause claim. F. Supp. 2d, at . TheRooker-Feldmandoctrine, the court explained, includes three requirements: (1) “the party against whom the doctrine is invoked must have actually been a party to the prior state-court judgment or have been in privity with such a party”; (2) “the claim raised in the federal suit must have been actually raised or inextricably intertwined with the state-court judgment”; and (3) “the federal claim must not be parallel to the state-court claim.” F. Supp. 2d, at . The District Court found the first requirement satisfied on the ground that the citizen plaintiffs were in privity with the Colorado General Assembly—a losing party inSalazar.Relying on our decisions inWashingtonv.Washington State Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel Assn., U. S. (), andTacomav.Taxpayers of Tacoma, U. S. (), the court stated that “when a state government litigates a matter of public concern, that state’s citizens will be deemed to be in privity with the government for preclusion purposes.” F. Supp. 2d, at . This principle, the court reasoned, applies “with equal force in theRooker-Feldmancontext.”Ibid. The court went on to conclude that the Elections Clause claim was actually raised inSalazar,or inextricably intertwined with that decision, and was not parallel to the claims presented inSalazar. As to the Petition Clause claim, the court ruled that neitherRooker-Feldmannor Colorado preclusion law prevented the court from proceeding to the merits, but that plaintiffs failed to state a claim. F. Supp. 2d, at ; see Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. (b)(6).The plaintiffs appealed. See U. S. C. §. We now note jurisdiction, and address whether theRooker-Feldmandoctrine bars the plaintiffs from proceeding because they were in privity with a party inSalazar. We conclude it does not, and vacate the judgment of the District Court.IIThis Court is vested, under U. S. C. §, with jurisdiction over appeals from final state-court judgments. We have held that this grant of jurisdiction is exclusive: “Review of such judgments may be hadonlyin this Court.”District of Columbia Court of Appealsv.Feldman, U. S. , () (emphasis added); see alsoAtlantic Coast Line R. Co.v.Locomotive Engineers, U. S. , ();Rookerv.Fidelity Trust Co., U. S. , (). Accordingly, under what has come to be known as theRooker-Feldmandoctrine, lower federal courts are precluded from exercising appellate jurisdiction over final state-court judgments.TheRooker-Feldmandoctrine takes its name from the only two cases in which we have applied this rule to find that a federal district court lacked jurisdiction. InRooker, a party who had lost in the Indiana Supreme Court, and failed to obtain review in this Court, filed an action in federal district court challenging the constitutionality of the state-court judgment. We viewed the action as tantamount to an appeal of the Indiana Supreme Court decision, over which only this Court had jurisdiction, and said that the “aggrieved litigant cannot be permitted to do indirectly what he no longer can do directly.” U. S., at .Feldman, decided years later, concerned slightly different circumstances, with similar results. The plaintiffs there had been refused admission to the District of Columbia bar by the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, and sought review of these decisions in federal district court. Our decision held that to the extent plaintiffs challenged the Court of Appeals decisions themselves—as opposed to the bar admission rules promulgated nonjudicially by the Court of Appeals—their sole avenue of review was with this Court. U. S., at .NeitherRookernorFeldmanelaborated a rationale for a wide-reaching bar on the jurisdiction of lower federal courts, and our cases sinceFeldmanhave tended to emphasize the narrowness of theRooker-Feldmanrule. SeeExxon Mobil, U. S., at (Rooker-Feldmandoes not apply to parallel state and federal litigation);Verizon Md. Inc.v.Public Serv. Comm’n of Md., U. S. , , n. 3 () (Rooker-Feldman“has no application to judicial review of executive action, including determinations made by a state administrative agency”);Johnsonv.De Grandy, U. S. , – () (Rooker-Feldmandoes not bar actions by a nonparty to the earlier state suit). Indeed, during that period, “this Court has never appliedRooker-Feldmanto dismiss an action for want of jurisdiction.”Exxon Mobil,supra,at .InExxon Mobil, decided last Term, we warned that the lower courts have at times extendedRooker-Feldman“far beyond the contours of theRookerandFeldmancases, overriding Congress’ conferral of federal-court jurisdiction concurrent with jurisdiction exercised by state courts, and superseding the ordinary application of preclusion law pursuant to U. S. C. §.” U. S., at .Rooker-Feldman, we explained, is a narrow doctrine, confined to “cases brought by state-court losers complaining of injuries caused by state-court judgments rendered before the district court proceedings commenced and inviting district court review and rejection of those judgments.” U. S., at .Although we have never addressed the precise question before us, we have heldRooker-Feldmaninapplicable where the party against whom the doctrine is invoked was not a party to the underlying state-court proceeding. SeeDe Grandy, supra,at . InDe Grandy,the State of Florida sought, usingRooker-Feldman, to prevent the United States from bringing a challenge under §2 of the Voting Rights Act of to the reapportionment of state electoral districts. The Florida Supreme Court, in an action initiated by the state attorney general, had already declared the law valid under state and federal law. We held thatRooker-Feldmandid not bar the United States from bringing its own action in federal court because the United States “was not a party in the state court,” and “was in no position to ask this Court to review the state court’s judgment and has not directly attacked it in this proceeding.” U. S., at .In the case before us, plaintiffs were plainly not parties to the underlying state-court proceeding inSalazar.Salazarwas an action brought by the state attorney general against the secretary of state, in which the Colorado General Assembly intervened. P. 3d, at . The four citizen-plaintiffs here did not participate inSalazar, and were not in a “position to ask this Court to review the state court’s judgment.”De Grandy,supra,at ; seeKarcherv.May, U. S. , () (“[T]he general rule [is] that one who is not a party or has not been treated as a party to a judgment has no right to appeal therefrom”).Although the District Court recognized the “general rule” that “Rooker-Feldmanmay not be invoked against a federal-court plaintiff who was not actually a party to the prior state-court judgment,” F. Supp. 2d, at , it nevertheless followed Tenth Circuit precedent in allowing application ofRooker-Feldmanagainst parties who were in privity with a party to the earlier state-court action. F. Supp. 2d, at (citingKenmen Eng.v.Union, F. 3d , ()). In determining whether privity existed, the court looked to cases concerning the preclusive effect that state courts are required to give federal-court judgments. F. Supp. 2d, at (citingWashington, U. S., at , n. ;Taxpayers of Tacoma, U. S., at –). It concluded that—forRooker-Feldmanas well as preclusion purposes—“the outcome of the government’s litigation over a matter of public concern binds its citizens.” F. Supp. 2d, at .The District Court erroneously conflated preclusion law withRooker-Feldman. Whatever the impact of privity principles on preclusion rules,Rooker-Feldmanis not simply preclusion by another name. The doctrine applies only in “limited circumstances,”Exxon Mobil,supra, at , where a party in effect seeks to take an appeal of an unfavorable state-court decision to a lower federal court. TheRooker-Feldmandoctrine does not bar actions by nonparties to the earlier state-court judgment simply because, for purposes of preclusion law, they could be considered in privity with a party to the judgment.[Footnote 2]A more expansiveRooker-Feldmanrule would tend to supplant Congress’ mandate, under the Full Faith and Credit Act, U. S. C. §, that federal courts “ ‘give the same preclusive effect to state court judgments that those judgments would be given in the courts of the State from which the judgments emerged.’ ”Bakerv.General Motors Corp., U. S. , () (quotingKremerv.Chemical Constr. Corp., U. S. , ()); seeExxon Mobil, supra, at . Congress has directed federal courts to look principally tostatelaw in deciding what effect to give state-court judgments. Incorporation of preclusion principles intoRooker-Feldmanrisks turning that limited doctrine into a uniformfederalrule governing the preclusive effect of state-court judgments, contrary to the Full Faith and Credit Act.[Footnote 3]* * *The judgment of the District Court is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.Footnote 1Although the secretary of state defended the legislature’s plan inSalazar, following that decision she agreed to defend the court-ordered plan in this litigation and to allow the state attorney general to represent her. F. Supp. 2d , , n. 3 (Colo. ).Footnote 2In holding thatRooker-Feldmandoes not bar plaintiffs here from proceeding, we need not address whether there areanycircumstances, however limited, in whichRooker-Feldmanmay be applied against a party not named in an earlier state proceeding—e.g., where an estate takes ade factoappeal in a district court of an earlier state decision involving the decedent.Footnote 3Our holding also disposes of the claim, which the District Court did not reach, that plaintiffs were barred byRooker-Feldmanbecause they were in privity with the secretary of state, the other losing party inPeople ex rel. Salazarv.Davidson, P. 3d (Colo. ) (en banc). We do not pass on the District Court’s resolution of the merits of plaintiffs’ Petition Clause claim."}

Decided January 9, 2017Per Curiam.This case addresses the situation of an officer who—having arrived late at an ongoing police action and having witnessed shots being fired by one of several individualsin a house surrounded by other officers—shoots and kills an armed occupant of the house without first giving a warning.According to the District Court and the Court of Appeals, the record, when viewed in the light most favorable to respondents, shows the following. Respondent Daniel Pauly was involved in a road-rage incident on a highway near Santa Fe, New Mexico. F. 3d , – ( ). It was in the evening, and it was raining. The two women involved called to report Daniel as a “ ‘drunk driver’ ” who was “ ‘swerving all crazy.’ ”Id.,at . The women then followed Daniel down the highway, close behind him and with their bright lights on. Daniel, feeling threatened, pulled his truck over at an off-ramp to confront them. After a brief, nonviolent encounter, Daniel drove a short distance to a secluded house where he lived with his brother, Samuel Pauly.Sometime between 9 p.m. and p.m., Officer Kevin Truesdale was dispatched to respond to the women’s call. Truesdale, arriving after Daniel had already left the scene, interviewed the two women at the off-ramp. The women told Truesdale that Daniel had been driving recklessly and gave his license plate number to Truesdale. The state police dispatcher identified the plate as being registered to the Pauly brothers’ address.After the women left, Officer Truesdale was joined at the off-ramp by Officers Ray White and Michael Mariscal. The three agreed there was insufficient probable cause to arrest Daniel. Still, the officers decided to speak with Daniel to (1) get his side of the story, (2) “ ‘make sure nothing else happened,’ ” and (3) find out if he was intoxicated.Id., at . The officers split up. White stayed at the off-ramp in case Daniel returned. Truesdale and Mariscal drove in separate patrol cars to the Pauly brothers’ address, less than a half mile away. Record . Neither officer turned on his flashing lights.When Officers Mariscal and Truesdale arrived at the address they had received from the dispatcher, they found two different houses, the first with no lights on inside and a second one behind it on a hill.Id.,at , . Lights were on in the second one. The officers parked their cars near the first house. They examined a vehicle parked near that house but did not find Daniel’s truck.Id.,at .Officers Mariscal and Truesdale noticed the lights on in the second house and approached it in a covert manner to maintain officer safety. Both used their flashlights in an intermittent manner. Truesdale alone turned on his flashlight once they got close to the house’s front door. Upon reaching the house, the officers found Daniel’s pickup truck and spotted two men moving around inside the residence. Truesdale and Mariscal radioed White, who left the off-ramp to join them.At approximately p.m., the Pauly brothers became aware of the officers’ presence and yelled out “ ‘Who are you?’ ” and “ ‘What do you want?’ ” F. 3d, at . In response, Officers Mariscal and Truesdale laughed and responded: “ ‘Hey, (expletive), we got you surrounded. Come out or we’re coming in.’ ”Ibid.Truesdale shouted once: “ ‘Open the door, State Police, open the door.’ ”Ibid.Mariscal also yelled: “ ‘Open the door, open the door.’ ”Ibid.The Pauly brothers heard someone yelling, “ ‘We’re coming in. We’re coming in.’ ”Ibid. Neither Samuel nor Daniel heard the officers identify themselves as state police. Record –. The brothers armed themselves, Samuel with a handgun and Daniel with a shotgun. One of the brothers yelled at the police officers that “ ‘We have guns.’ ” F. 3d, at .The officers saw someone run to the back of the house, so Officer Truesdale positioned himself behind the house and shouted “ ‘Open the door, come outside.’ ”Ibid.Officer White had parked at the first house and was walking up to its front door when he heard shouting from the second house. He half-jogged, half-walked to the Paulys’ house, arriving “just as one of the brothers said: ‘We have guns.’ ”Ibid.; see also Civ. No. – (D NM, Feb. 5, ), App. to Pet. for Cert. –. When White heard that statement, he drew his gun and took cover behind a stone wall feet from the front of the house. Officer Mariscal took cover behind a pickup truck.Just “a few seconds” after the “We have guns” statement, Daniel stepped part way out of the back door and fired two shotgun blasts while screaming loudly. F. 3d, at –. A few seconds after those shots, Samuel opened the front window and pointed a handgun in Officer White’s direction. Officer Mariscal fired immediately at Samuel but missed. “ ‘Four to five seconds’ ” later, White shot and killed Samuel.Id.,at .The District Court denied the officers’ motions for summary judgment, and the facts are viewed in the light most favorable to the Paulys.Mullenixv.Luna, U. S. () (per curiam) (slip op., at 2, n.). Because this case concerns the defense of qualified immunity, however, the Court considers only the facts that were knowable to the defendant officers.Kingsleyv.Hendrickson, U. S., at 9).Samuel’s estate and Daniel filed suit against,inter alia, Officers Mariscal, Truesdale, and White. One of the claims was that the officers were liable under Rev. Stat. §, U. S. C. §, for violating Samuel’s Fourth Amendment right to be free from excessive force. All three officers moved for summary judgment on qualified immunity grounds. White in particular argued that the Pauly brothers could not show that White’s use of force vio-lated the Fourth Amendment and, regardless, that Sam-uel’s Fourth Amendment right to be free from deadlyforce under the circumstances of this case was not clearly established.The District Court denied qualified immunity. A di-vided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuitaffirmed. As to Officers Mariscal and Truesdale, the court held that “[a]ccepting as true plaintiffs’ version of the facts, a reasonable person in the officers’ position should have understood their conduct would cause Samuel and Daniel Pauly to defend their home and could result in the commission of deadly force against Samuel Pauly by Officer White.” F. 3d, at . The panel majority analyzed Officer White’s claim separately from the other officers because “Officer White did not participate in the events leading up to the armed confrontation, nor was he there to hear the other officers ordering the brothers to ‘Come out or we’re coming in.’ ”Ibid.Despite the fact that “Officer White . . . arrived late on the scene and heard only ‘We have guns’ . . . before taking cover behind a stone wall,” the majority held that a jury could have concluded that White’s use of deadly force was not reasonable.Id.,at , . The majority also decided that this rule—that a reasonable officer in White’s position would believe that a warning was required despite the threat of serious harm—was clearly established at the time of Samuel’s death. The Court of Appeals’ ruling relied on general statements from this Court’s case law that (1) “the reasonableness of an officer’s use of force depends, in part, on whether the officer was in danger at the precise moment that he used force” and (2) “if the suspect threatens the officer with a weapon[,] deadly force may be used if necessary to prevent escape, and if[,] where feasible, some warning has been given.”Id., at (citing,inter alia,Tennesseev.Garner, U. S. 1 () , andGrahamv.Connor, U. S. () ; emphasis deleted; internal quotation marks and alterations omitted). The court concluded that a reasonable officer in White’s position would have known that, since the Paulys could not have shot him unless he moved from his position behind a stone wall, he could not have used deadly force without first warning Samuel Pauly to drop his weapon.Judge Moritz dissented, contending that the “majority impermissibly second-guesses” Officer White’s quick choice to use deadly force. F. 3d, at . Judge Moritz explained that the majority also erred by defining the clearly established law at too high a level of generality, in contravention of this Court’s precedent.The officers petitioned for rehearing en banc, which 6 of the judges on the Court of Appeals voted to grant. In a dissent from denial of rehearing, Judge Hartz noted that he was “unaware of any clearly established law that suggests . . . that an officer . . . who faces an occupant pointing a firearm in his direction must refrain from firing his weapon but, rather, must identify himself and shout a warning while pinned down, kneeling behind a rock wall.” F. 3d , ( ). Judge Hartz expressed his hope that “the Supreme Court can clarify the governing law.”Id.,at .The officers petitioned for certiorari. The petition is now granted, and the judgment is vacated: Officer White did not violate clearly established law on the record described by the Court of Appeals panel.Qualified immunity attaches when an official’s conduct “ ‘does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.’ ”Mullenixv.Luna, U. S., at 4–5). While this Court’s case law “ ‘do[es] not require a case directly on point’ ” for a right to be clearly established, “ ‘existing precedent must have placed the statutory or constitutional question beyond debate.’ ”Id., at 5). In other words, immunity protects “ ‘all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.’ ”Ibid.In the last five years, this Court has issued a number of opinions reversing federal courts in qualified immunity cases. See, e.g., City and County of San Franciscov.Sheehan, U. S. 3 () (slip op., at , n.3) (collecting cases). The Court has found this necessary both because qualified immunity is important to “ ‘society as a whole,’ ”ibid., and because as “ ‘an immunity from suit,’ ” qualified immunity “ ‘is effectively lost if a case is erroneously permitted to go to trial,’ ”Pearsonv.Callahan, U. S. , () .Today, it is again necessary to reiterate the longstanding principle that “clearly established law” should not be defined “at a high level of generality.”Ashcroftv.al-Kidd, U. S. , () . As this Court explained decades ago, the clearly established law must be “particularized” to the facts of the case.Andersonv.Creighton, U. S. , () . Otherwise, “[p]laintiffs would be able to convert the rule of qualified immunity . . . into a rule of virtually unqualified liability simply by alleging violation of extremely abstract rights.”Id.,at .The panel majority misunderstood the “clearly established” analysis: It failed to identify a case where an officer acting under similar circumstances as Officer White was held to have violated the Fourth Amendment. Instead, the majority relied onGraham,Garner, and their Court of Appeals progeny, which—as noted above—lay out excessive-force principles at only a general level. Of course, “general statements of the law are not inherently incapable of giving fair and clear warning” to officers,United Statesv.Lanier, U. S. , () , but “in the light of pre-existing law the unlawfulness must be apparent,”Andersonv.Creighton,supra, at . For that reason, we have held thatGarnerandGrahamdo notby themselves create clearly established law outside“an obvious case.”Brosseauv.Haugen, U. S. , () (per curiam); see alsoPlumhoffv.Rickard, U. S., at ) (emphasiz-ing thatGarnerandGraham“are ‘cast at a high level of generality’ ”).This is not a case where it is obvious that there was a violation of clearly established law underGarnerandGraham. Of note, the majority did not conclude that White’s conduct—such as his failure to shout a warning—constituted a run-of-the-mill Fourth Amendment violation. Indeed, it recognized that “this case presents a unique set of facts and circumstances” in light of White’s late arrival on the scene. F. 3d, at . This alone should have been an important indication to the majority that White’s conduct did not violate a “clearly established” right. Clearly established federal law does not prohibit a reasonable officer who arrives late to an ongoing police action in circumstances like this from assuming that proper procedures, such as officer identification, have already been followed. No settled Fourth Amendment principle requires that officer to second-guess the earlier steps already taken by his or her fellow officers in instances like the one White confronted here.On the record described by the Court of Appeals, Officer White did not violate clearly established law. The Court notes, however, that respondents contend Officer White arrived on the scene only two minutes after Officers Truesdale and Mariscal and more than three minutes before Daniel’s shots were fired. On the assumption that the conduct of Officers Truesdale and Mariscal did not adequately alert the Paulys that they were police officers, respondents suggest that a reasonable jury could infer that White witnessed the other officers’ deficient performance and should have realized that corrective action was necessary before using deadly force. Brief in Opposition , , n. 5. This Court expresses no position on this potential alternative ground for affirmance, as it appears that neither the District Court nor the Court of Appeals panel addressed it. The Court also expresses no opinion on the question whether this ground was properly preserved or whether—in light of this Court’s holding today—Officers Truesdale and Mariscal are entitled to qualified immunity.For the foregoing reasons, the petition for certiorari is granted; the judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated; and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered."}

Decided June , 2020Per Curiam.Death-sentenced petitioner Terence Andrus was six years old when his mother began selling drugs out of the apartment where Andrus and his four siblings lived. To fund a spiraling drug addiction, Andrus’ mother also turned to prostitution. By the time Andrus was , his mother regularly spent entire weekends, at times weeks, away from her five children to binge on drugs. When she did spend time around her children, she often was high and brought with her a revolving door of drug-addicted, sometimes physically violent, boyfriends. Before he reached adolescence, Andrus took on the role of caretaker for his four siblings.When Andrus was , he allegedly served as a lookout while his friends robbed a woman. He was sent to a juvenile detention facility where, for months, he was steeped in gang culture, dosed on high quantities of psychotropic drugs, and frequently relegated to extended stints of solitary confinement. The ordeal left an already traumatized Andrus all but suicidal. Those suicidal urges resurfaced later in Andrus’ adult life.During Andrus’ capital trial, however, nearly none of this mitigating evidence reached the jury. That is because Andrus’ defense counsel not only neglected to present it; he failed even to look for it. Indeed, counsel performed virtually no investigation of the relevant evidence. Those failures also fettered the defense’s capacity to contextualize or counter the State’s evidence of Andrus’ alleged incidences of past violence.Only years later, during an 8-day evidentiary hearing in Andrus’ state habeas proceeding, did the grim facts of Andrus’ life history come to light. And when pressed at the hearing to provide his reasons for failing to investigate Andrus’ history, Andrus’ counsel offered none.The Texas trial court that heard the evidence recommended that Andrus be granted habeas relief and receive a new sentencing proceeding. The court found the abundant mitigating evidence so compelling, and so readily available, that counsel’s failure to investigate it was constitutionally deficient performance that prejudiced Andrus during the punishment phase of his trial. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals disagreed. It concluded without explanation that Andrus had failed to satisfy his burden of showing ineffective assistance underStricklandv.Washington, U.S. ().We conclude that the record makes clear that Andrus has demonstrated counsel’s deficient performance underStrickland, but that the Court of Criminal Appeals may have failed properly to engage with the follow-on question whether Andrus has shown that counsel’s deficient performance prejudiced him. We thus grant Andrus’ petition for a writ of certiorari, vacate the judgment of the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, and remand the case for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.IAIn , -year-old Terence Andrus unsuccessfully attempted a carjacking in a grocery-store parking lot while under the influence of PCP-laced marijuana. During the bungled attempt, Andrus fired multiple shots, killing car owner Avelino Diaz and bystander Kim-Phuong Vu Bui. The State charged Andrus with capital murder.At the guilt phase of trial, Andrus’ defense counsel declined to present an opening statement. After the State rested its case, the defense immediately rested as well. In his closing argument, defense counsel conceded Andrus’ guilt and informed the jury that the trial would “boil down to the punishment phase,” emphasizing that “that’s where we are going to be fighting.” Tr. . The jury found Andrus guilty of capital murder.Trial then turned to the punishment phase. Once again, Andrus’ counsel presented no opening statement. In its 3-day case in aggravation, the State put forth evidence that Andrus had displayed aggressive and hostile behavior while confined in a juvenile detention center; that Andrus had tattoos indicating gang affiliations; and that Andrus had hit, kicked, and thrown excrement at prison officials while awaiting trial. The State also presented evidence tying Andrus to an aggravated robbery of a dry-cleaning business. Counsel raised no material objections to the State’s evidence and cross-examined the State’s witnesses only briefly.When it came to the defense’s case in mitigation, counsel first called Andrus’ mother to testify. The direct examination focused on Andrus’ basic biographical information and did not reveal any difficult circumstances in Andrus’ childhood. Andrus’ mother testified that Andrus had an “excellent” relationship with his siblings and grandparents. 49id., at , . She also insisted that Andrus “didn’t have access to” “drugs or pills in [her] household,” and that she would have “counsel[ed] him” had she found out that he was using drugs.Id., at , .The second witness was Andrus’ biological father, Michael Davis, with whom Andrus had lived for about a year when Andrus was around years old. Davis had been in and out of prison for much of Andrus’ life and, before he appeared to testify, had not seen Andrus in more than six years. The bulk of Davis’ direct examination explored such topics as Davis’ criminal history and his relationship with Andrus’ mother. Toward the end of the direct examination, counsel elicited testimony that Andrus had been “good around [Davis]” during the 1-year period he had lived with Davis. 50id., at 8.Once Davis stepped down, Andrus’ counsel informed the court that the defense rested its case and did not intend to call any more witnesses. After the court questioned counsel about this choice during a sidebar discussion, however, counsel changed his mind and decided to call additional witnesses.Following a court recess, Andrus’ counsel called Dr. John Roache as the defense’s only expert witness. Counsel’s terse direct examination focused on the general effects of drug use on developing adolescent brains. On cross-examination, the State quizzed Dr. Roache about the relevance and purpose of his testimony, probing pointedly whether Dr. Roache “drove three hours from San Antonio to tell the jury . . . that people change their behavior when they use drugs.” 51id., at .Counsel next called James Martins, a prison counselor who had worked with Andrus. Martins testified that Andrus “started having remorse” in the past two months and was “making progress.”Id., at . On cross-examination, the State emphasized that Andrus’ feelings of remorse had manifested only recently, around the time trial began.Finally, Andrus himself testified. Contrary to his mother’s depiction of his upbringing, he stated that his mother had started selling drugs when he was around six years old, and that he and his siblings were often home alone when they were growing up. He also explained that he first started using drugs regularly around the time he was . All told, counsel’s questioning about Andrus’ childhood comprised four pages of the trial transcript. The State on cross declared, “I have not heard one mitigating circumstance in your life.”Id., at .The jury sentenced Andrus to death.BAfter an unsuccessful direct appeal, Andrus filed a state habeas application, principally alleging that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate or present available mitigation evidence. During an 8-day evidentiary hearing, Andrus presented what the Texas trial court characterized as a “tidal wave of information . . . with regard to mitigation.” 7 Habeas Tr. .The evidence revealed a childhood marked by extreme neglect and privation, a family environment filled with violence and abuse. Andrus was born into a neighborhood of Houston, Texas, known for its frequent shootings, gang fights, and drug overdoses. Andrus’ mother had Andrus, her second of five children, when she was . The children’s fathers never stayed as part of the family. One of them raped Andrus’ younger half sister when she was a child. The others—some physically abusive toward Andrus’ mother, all addicted to drugs and carrying criminal histories—constantly flitted in and out of the picture.Starting when Andrus was young, his mother sold drugs and engaged in prostitution. She often made her drug sales at home, in view of Andrus and his siblings. She also habitually used drugs in front of them, and was high more often than not. In her frequently disoriented state, she would leave her children to fend for themselves. Many times, there was not enough food to eat.After her boyfriend was killed in a shooting, Andrus’ mother became increasingly dependent on drugs and neglectful of her children. As a close family friend attested, Andrus’ mother “would occasionally just take a week or a weekend and binge [on drugs]. She would get a room somewhere and just go at it.” Habeas Tr., Def. Exh. , p. 2.With the children often left on their own, Andrus assumed responsibility as the head of the household for his four siblings, including his older brother with special needs. Andrus was around years old at the time. He cleaned for his siblings, put them to bed, cooked breakfast for them, made sure they got ready for school, helped them with their homework, and made them dinner. According to his siblings, Andrus was “a protective older brother” who “kept on to [them] to stay out of trouble.”Id., Def. Exh. , p. 1. Andrus, by their account, was “very caring and very loving,” “liked to make people laugh,” and “never liked to see people cry.”Ibid.;id., Def. Exh. 9, p. 1. While attempting to care for his siblings, Andrus struggled with mental-health issues: When he was only or , he was diagnosed with affective psychosis.At age , Andrus was sentenced to a juvenile detention center run by the Texas Youth Commission (TYC), for allegedly “serv[ing] as the ‘lookout’ ” while he and his friends robbed a woman of her purse. Habeas Tr., State Exh. , p. 9; 13id., Def. Exh. 4, p. 4 (“[R]ecords indicate[d that] Andrus served as the lookout”); 3id., at –; 5id., at .[1] While in TYC custody, Andrus was prescribed high doses of psychotropic drugs carrying serious adverse side effects. He also spent extended periods in isolation, often for purported infractions like reporting that he had heard voices telling him to do bad things. TYC records on Andrus noted multiple instances of self-harm and threats of suicide. After months in TYC custody, Andrus was transferred to an adult prison facility.Not long after Andrus’ release from prison at age , Andrus attempted the fatal carjacking that resulted in his capital convictions. While incarcerated awaiting trial, Andrus tried to commit suicide. He slashed his wrist with a razor blade and used his blood to smear messages on the walls, beseeching the world to “[j]ust let [him] die.” 31id., Def. Exh. –A, ANDRUS–SH .After considering all the evidence at the hearing, the Texas trial court concluded that Andrus’ counsel had been ineffective for “failing to investigate and present mitigating evidence regarding [Andrus’] abusive and neglectful childhood.” App. to Pet. for Cert. . The court observed that the reason Andrus’ jury did not hear “relevant, available, and persuasive mitigating evidence” was that trial counsel had “fail[ed] to investigate and present all other mitigating evidence.”Id., at –. The court explained that “there [is] ample mitigating evidence which could have, and should have, been presented at the punishment phase of [Andrus’] trial.”Id., at . For that reason, the court concluded that counsel had been constitutionally ineffective, and that habeas relief, in the form of a new punishment trial, was warranted.Id., at , .CThe Texas Court of Criminal Appeals rejected the trial court’s recommendation to grant habeas relief. In an unpublishedper curiamorder, the Court of Criminal Appeals concluded without elaboration that Andrus had “fail[ed] to meet his burden underStricklandv.Washington, U.S. (), to show by a preponderance of the evidence that his counsel’s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and that there was a reasonable probability that the result of the proceedings would have been different but for counsel’s deficient performance.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 7–8. A concurring opinion reasoned that, even if counsel had provided deficient performance underStrickland, Andrus could not show that counsel’s deficient performance prejudiced him.Andrus petitioned for a writ of certiorari. We grant the petition, vacate the judgment of the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, and remand for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. The evidence makes clear that Andrus’ counsel provided constitutionally deficient performance underStrickland. But we remand so that the Court of Criminal Appeals may address the prejudice prong ofStricklandin the first instance.IITo prevail on a Sixth Amendment claim alleging ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must show that his counsel’s performance was deficient and that his counsel’s deficient performance prejudiced him.Strickland, U. S., at , . To show deficiency, a defendant must show that “counsel’s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.”Id., at . And to establish prejudice, a defendant must show “that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.”Id., at .A“It is unquestioned that under prevailing professional norms at the time of [Andrus’] trial, counsel had an ‘obligation to conduct a thorough investigation of the defendant’s background.’ ”Porterv.McCollum, U.S. , () (per curiam) (quotingWilliamsv.Taylor, U.S. , ()). Counsel in a death-penalty case has “ ‘a duty to make reasonable investigations or to make a reasonable decision that makes particular investigations unnecessary.’ ”Wigginsv.Smith, U.S. , () (quotingStrickland, U. S., at ). “ ‘In any ineffectiveness case, a particular decision not to investigate must be directly assessed for reasonableness in all the circumstances, applying a heavy measure of deference to counsel’s judgments.’ ”Wiggins, U. S., at –.Here, the habeas record reveals that Andrus’ counsel fell short of his obligation in multiple ways: First, counsel performed almost no mitigation investigation, overlooking vast tranches of mitigating evidence. Second, due to counsel’s failure to investigate compelling mitigating evidence, what little evidence counsel did present backfired by bolstering the State’s aggravation case. Third, counsel failed adequately to investigate the State’s aggravating evidence, thereby forgoing critical opportunities to rebut the case in aggravation. Taken together, those deficiencies effected an unconstitutional abnegation of prevailing professional norms.1To assess whether counsel exercised objectively reasonable judgment under prevailing professional standards, we first ask “whether the investigation supporting counsel’s decision not to introduce mitigating evidence of [Andrus’] background was itself reasonable.”Id., at (emphasis deleted); see alsoid., at (considering whether “thescopeof counsel’s investigation into petitioner’s background” was reasonable);Porter, U. S., at . Here, plainly not. Although counsel nominally put on a case in mitigation in that counsel in fact called witnesses to the stand after the prosecution rested, the record leaves no doubt that counsel’s investigation to support that case was an empty exercise.To start, counsel was, by his own admissions at the habeas hearing, barely acquainted with the witnesses who testified during the case in mitigation. Counsel acknowledged that the first time he met Andrus’ mother was when she was subpoenaed to testify, and the first time he met Andrus’ biological father was when he showed up at the courthouse to take the stand. Counsel also admitted that he did not get in touch with the third witness (Dr. Roache) until just beforevoir dire, and became aware of the final witness (Martins) only partway through trial. Apart from some brief pretrial discussion with Dr. Roache, who averred that he was “struck by the extent to which [counsel] appeared unfamiliar” with pertinent issues, counsel did not prepare the witnesses or go over their testimony before calling them to the stand. Habeas Tr., Def. Exh. 6, p. 3.Over and over during the habeas hearing, counsel acknowledged that he did not look into or present the myriad tragic circumstances that marked Andrus’ life. For instance, he did not know that Andrus had attempted suicide in prison, or that Andrus’ experience in the custody of the TYC left him badly traumatized. Aside from Andrus’ mother and biological father, counsel did not meet with any of Andrus’ close family members, all of whom had disturbing stories about Andrus’ upbringing. As a clinical psychologist testified at the habeas hearing, Andrus suffered “very pronounced trauma” and posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms from, among other things, “severe neglect” and exposure to domestic violence, substance abuse, and death in his childhood. 6id., at –, ; 7id., at . Counsel uncovered none of that evidence. Instead, he “abandoned [his] investigation of [Andrus’] background after having acquired only rudimentary knowledge of his history from a narrow set of sources.”Wiggins, U. S., at .On top of that, counsel “ignored pertinent avenues for investigation of which he should have been aware,” and indeed was aware.Porter, U. S., at . At trial, counsel averred that his review did not reveal that Andrus had any mental-health issues. But materials prepared by a mitigation expert well before trial had pointed out that Andrus had been “diagnosed with affective psychosis,” a mental-health condition marked by symptoms such as depression, mood lability, and emotional dysregulation. 3id., at . At the habeas hearing, counsel admitted that he “recall[ed] noting,” based on the mitigation expert’s materials, that Andrus had been “diagnosed with this seemingly serious mental health issue.”Id., at . He also acknowledged that a clinical psychologist briefly retained to examine a limited sample of Andrus’ files had informed him that Andrus may have schizophrenia. Clearly, “the known evidence would [have] le[d] a reasonable attorney to investigate further.”Wiggins, U. S., at . Yet counsel disregarded, rather than explored, the multiple red flags.In short, counsel performed virtually no investigation, either of the few witnesses he called during the case in mitigation, or of the many circumstances in Andrus’ life that could have served as powerful mitigating evidence. The untapped body of mitigating evidence was, as the habeas hearing revealed, simply vast.“[C]ounsel’s failure to uncover and present [the] voluminous mitigating evidence,” moreover, cannot “be justified as a tactical decision.”Id., at ; see alsoWilliams, U. S., at . Despite repeated questioning, counsel never offered, and no evidence supports, any tactical rationale for the pervasive oversights and lapses here. Instead, the overwhelming weight of the record shows that counsel’s “failure to investigate thoroughly resulted from inattention, not reasoned strategic judgment.”Wiggins, U. S., at . That failure is all the more alarming given that counsel’s purported strategy was to concede guilt and focus on mitigation. Indeed, counsel justified his decision to present “basically” “no defense” during the guilt phase by stressing that he intended to train his efforts on the case in mitigation. 3 Habeas Tr. . As the habeas hearing laid bare, that representation blinked reality. Simply put, “the scope of counsel’s [mitigation] investigation” approached nonexistent.Wiggins, U. S., at (emphasis deleted).2No doubt due to counsel’s failure to investigate the case in mitigation, much of the so-called mitigating evidence he offered unwittingly aided the State’s case in aggravation. Counsel’s introduction of seeminglyaggravatingevidence confirms the gaping distance between his performance at trial and objectively reasonable professional judgment.The testimony elicited from Andrus’ mother best illustrates this deficiency. First to testify during the case in mitigation, Andrus’ mother sketched a portrait of a tranquil upbringing, during which Andrus got himself into trouble despite his family’s best efforts. On her account, Andrus fell into drugs entirely on his own: Drugs were not available at home, Andrus did not use them at home, and she would have intervened had she known about Andrus’ drug habits. Andrus, his mother related to the jury, “[k]ind of ” “just decided he didn’t want to do what [she] told him to do.” Tr. .Even though counsel called Andrus’ mother as a defense witness, he was ill-prepared for her testimony. Andrus told counsel that his mother was being untruthful on the stand, but counsel made no real attempt to probe the accuracy of her testimony. Later, at the habeas hearing, counsel conceded that Andrus’ mother had been a “hostile” witness. 3 Habeas Tr. . He further admitted that he “[did not] know if [Andrus’ mother] was telling the truth,”id., at , and could not even say that he had known what Andrus’ mother would say on the stand, because he had not “done any independent investigation” of her,id., at .None of that inaction was for want of warning. During the habeas proceedings, a mitigation specialist averred that she had alerted Andrus’ counsel to her concerns about Andrus’ mother well before trial. In a short interview with the mitigation specialist, Andrus’ mother had stated that she “had too many kids,” and had taken out a $, life-insurance policy on Andrus on which she would be able to collect were Andrus executed. 13id., Def. Exh. , p. 5. Troubled by these comments, the mitigation specialist “specifically discussed with [Andrus’ counsel] the fact that [Andrus’ mother] was not being a cooperative witness and might not have Andrus’ best interests motivating her behavior.”Id., at 6. But Andrus’ counsel did not heed the caution.Turning a bad situation worse, counsel’s uninformed decision to call Andrus’ mother ultimately undermined Andrus’ own testimony. After Andrus testified that his mother had sold drugs from home when he was a child, counsel promptly pointed out that Andrus “heard [his] mama testify,” and that she “didn’t say anything about selling drugs.” Tr. . Whether counsel merely intended to provide Andrus an opportunity to explain the discrepancy (or, far worse, sought to signal that his client was being deceitful) the jury could have understood counsel’s statements to insinuate that Andrus was lying. Counsel did nothing to dislodge that suggestion, and the damaging exchange occurred only because defense counsel had called a hostile witness in the first place. Plainly, these offerings of seemingly aggravating evidence further demonstrate counsel’s constitutionally deficient performance.3Counsel also failed to conduct any independent investigation of the State’s case in aggravation, despite ample opportunity to do so. He thus could not, and did not, rebut critical aggravating evidence. This failure, too, reinforces counsel’s deficient performance. SeeRompillav.Beard, U.S. , () (“counsel ha[s] a duty to make all reasonable efforts to learn what they c[an] about the offense[s]” the prosecution intends to present as aggravating evidence).During the case in aggravation, the State’s task was to prove to the jury that Andrus presented a future danger to society. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. ., §2(b)(1) (Vernon ). To that end, the State emphasized that Andrus had acted aggressively in TYC facilities and in prison while awaiting trial. This evidence principally comprised verbal threats, but also included instances of Andrus’ kicking, hitting, and throwing excrement at prison officials when they tried to control him. See App. to Pet. for Cert. –. Had counsel genuinely investigated Andrus’ experiences in TYC custody, counsel would have learned that Andrus’ behavioral problems there were notably mild, and the harms he sustained severe.[2] Or, with sufficient understanding of the violent environments Andrus inhabited his entire life, counsel could have provided a counternarrative of Andrus’ later episodes in prison. But instead, counsel left all of that aggravating evidence untouched at trial—even going so far as to inform the jury that the evidence made it “probabl[e]” that Andrus was “a violent kind of guy.” Tr. .The State’s case in aggravation also highlighted Andrus’ alleged commission of a knifepoint robbery at a dry-cleaning business. At the time of the offense, “all [that] the crime victim . . . told the police . . . was that he had been the victim of an assault by a black man.” 3 Habeas Tr. . Although Andrus stressed to counsel his innocence of the offense, and although the State had not proceeded with charges, Andrus’ counsel did not attempt to exclude or rebut the State’s evidence. That, too, is because Andrus’ counsel concededly had not independently investigated the incident. In fact, at the habeas hearing, counsel did not even recall Andrus’ denying responsibility for the offense. Had he looked, counsel would have discovered that the only evidence originally tying Andrus to the incident was a lone witness statement, later recanted by the witness,[3] that led to the inclusion of Andrus’ photograph in a belated photo array, which the police admitted gave rise to numerous reliability concerns. The dissent thus reinforces Andrus’ claim of deficient performance by recounting and emphasizing the details of the dry-cleaning offense as if Andrus were undoubtedly the perpetrator. Seepost, at 6 (opinion of [REDACTED], J.). The very problem here is that the jury indeed heard that account, but not any of the significant evidence that would have cast doubt on Andrus’ involvement in the offense at all: significant evidence that counsel concededly failed to investigate.[4]That is hardly the work of reasonable counsel. In Texas, a jury cannot recommend a death sentence without unanimously finding that a defendant presents a future danger to society (i.e., that the State has made a sufficient showing of aggravation). Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. ., §2(b)(1). Only after a jury makes a finding of future dangerousness can it consider any mitigating evidence.Ibid.Thus, by failing to conduct even a marginally adequate investigation, counsel not only “seriously compromis[ed his] opportunity to respond to a case for aggravation,”Rompilla, U. S., at , but also relinquished the first of only two procedural pathways for opposing the State’s pursuit of the death penalty. There is no squaring that conduct, certainly when examined alongside counsel’s other shortfalls, with objectively reasonable judgment.BHaving found deficient performance, the question remains whether counsel’s deficient performance prejudiced Andrus. SeeStrickland, U. S., at . Here, prejudice exists if there is a reasonable probability that, but for his counsel’s ineffectiveness, the jury would have made a different judgment about whether Andrus deserved the death penalty as opposed to a lesser sentence. SeeWiggins, U. S., at ; see also Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. ., §2(e)(1). In assessing whether Andrus has made that showing, the reviewing court must consider “the totality of the available mitigation evidence—both that adduced at trial, and the evidence adduced in the habeas proceeding”—and “reweig[h] it against the evidence in aggravation.”Williams, U. S., at –; see alsoSearsv.Upton, U.S. , () (per curiam) (“A proper analysis of prejudice underStricklandwould have taken into account the newly uncovered [mitigation] evidence . . . , along with the mitigation evidence introduced during [the defendant’s] penalty phase trial, to assess whether there is a reasonable probability that [the defendant] would have received a different sentence after a constitutionally sufficient mitigation investigation” (citing cases)). And because Andrus’ death sentence required a unanimous jury recommendation, Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. ., prejudice here requires only “a reasonable probability that at least one juror would have struck a different balance” regarding Andrus’ “moral culpability,”Wiggins, U. S., at –; see also Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. ., §2(e)(1).According to Andrus, effective counsel would have painted a vividly different tableau of aggravating and mitigating evidence than that presented at trial. See Pet. for Cert. . But despite powerful and readily available mitigating evidence, Andrus argues, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals failed to engage in any meaningful prejudice inquiry. Seeibid.It is unclear whether the Court of Criminal Appeals con- sideredStricklandprejudice at all. Its one-sentence denial of Andrus’Stricklandclaim, seesupra, at 7, does not conclusively reveal whether it determined that Andrus had failed to demonstrate deficient performance underStrickland’s first prong, that Andrus had failed to demonstrate prejudice underStrickland’s second prong, or that Andrus had failed to satisfy both prongs ofStrickland.Unlike the concurring opinion, however, the brief order of the Court of Criminal Appeals did not analyzeStricklandprejudice or engage with the effect the additional mitigating evidence highlighted by Andrus would have had on the jury.[5] What little is evident from the proceeding below is that the concurring opinion’s analysis of or conclusion regarding prejudice did not garner a majority of the Court of Criminal Appeals.[6] Given that, the court may have concluded simply that Andrus failed to demonstrate deficient performance under the first prong ofStrickland(without even reaching the second prong). For the reasons explained above, any such conclusion is erroneous as a matter of law. Seesupra, at 8–.The record before us raises a significant question whether the apparent “tidal wave,” 7 Habeas Tr. , of “available mitigating evidence taken as a whole” might have sufficiently “ ‘influenced the jury’s appraisal’ of [Andrus’] moral culpability” as to establishStricklandprejudice,Wiggins, U. S., at (quotingWilliams, U. S., at ). (That is, at the very least, whether there is a reasonable probability that “at least one juror would have struck a different balance.”Wiggins, U. S., at .) That prejudice inquiry “necessarily require[s] a court to ‘speculate’ as to the effect of the new evidence” on the trial evidence, “regardless of how much or little mitigation evidence was presented during the initial penalty phase.”Sears, U. S., at ; see alsoid., at (“We have never limited the prejudice inquiry underStricklandto cases in which there was ‘little or no mitigation evidence’ presented”).[7] Given the uncertainty as to whether the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals adequately conducted that weighty and record-intensive analysis in the first instance, we remand for the Court of Criminal Appeals to addressStricklandprejudice in light of the correct legal principles articulated above. SeeCutterv.Wilkinson, U.S. , , n. 7 ().* * *We conclude that Andrus has shown deficient performance under the first prong ofStrickland, and that there is a significant question whether the Court of Criminal Appeals properly considered prejudice under the second prong ofStrickland. We thus grant Andrus’ petition for a writ of certiorari and his motion for leave to proceedin forma pauperis, vacate the judgment of the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, and remand the case for the court to address the prejudice prong ofStricklandin a manner not inconsistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.Notes1The dissent states that the victim identified Andrus as the individual holding the gun,post, at 5 (opinion of [REDACTED], J.), but in fact, the victim testified at Andrus’ trial that she did not and could not identify faces or individuals, see 4 Tr. , –. The dissent also claims that “the victim matched Andrus’s clothing to the gunman’s,”post, at 5, n. 1, but neglects to mention that the victim described at least two individuals as wearing such clothing, see Tr. –.2See,e.g., 5 Habeas Tr. (TYC ombudsman testifying that it was “surpris[ing] how few” citations Andrus received, “particularly in the dorms where [Andrus] was” housed);ibid.(TYC ombudsman finding “nothing uncommon” about Andrus’ altercations because “sometimes you . . . have to fight to get by” in the “violent atmosphere” and “savage environment”);id., at (TYC ombudsman testifying that Andrus’ isolation periods in TCY custody, for days at a time when Andrus was or years old, “would horrify most current professionals in our justice field today”);id., at (TYC ombudsman testifying that Andrus’ “experience at TYC” “damaged him” and “further traumatized” him).3The dissent maintains that this witness, Andrus’ ex-girlfriend, “linked [Andrus] to the robbery,”post, at 6, n. 4, even though she testified at the habeas hearing that she thought “it was impossible” that Andrus had committed the offense, 8 Habeas Tr. .4The dissent does not mention that Andrus’ image was conspicuously placed in a central position in the photo array, as the “[o]nly one . . . looking directly up and out.” 8 Habeas Tr. ; see alsoid., at . Nor does the dissent acknowledge that there was an approximately 3-month interval between the incident (after which the victim provided little identifying information about the assailant) and the police’s presentation of the photo array to the victim. Seeid., at ; Tr. . When asked about the delay, the detective who prepared the photo array admitted that memory can “deca[y] within a matter of days after a traumatizing incident like a crime” and that an “eyewitness identificatio[n]” “can be” “more exponentially problematic” “the greater the time interval between the incident and the identification.” 8 Habeas Tr. ; see alsoibid.(detective confirming that there can be “real problems with reliability” if an “identification [was] made several months” after).5The Court of Criminal Appeals did briefly observe that the trial court’s order recommending relief had omitted the “ ‘reasonable probabili-ty’ ” language when reciting theStricklandprejudice standard.

S., at (a defendant “must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s unpro-fessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different”). Even were there reason to set aside that “[t]rial judges are presumed to know the law,”Lambrixv.Singletary, U.S. , , n. 4 () (in-ternal quotation marks omitted), the trial court’s omission of the “reasonable probability” language would at most suggest that it held Andrusto (and found that Andrus had satisfied) a stricter standard of prejudice than that set forth inStrickland.6The concurring opinion, moreover, seemed to assume that the prejudice inquiry here turns principally on how the facts of this case compare to the facts inWiggins. We note that we have never before equated what was sufficient inWigginswith what is necessary to establish prejudice. Cf.Wiggins, U. S., at – (“[T]he mitigating evidence in this case is stronger, and the State’s evidence in support of the death penalty far weaker, than inWilliams, where we found prejudice as the result of counsel’s failure to investigate and present mitigating evidence”);Williams, U.

Decided May 2, 2011Per Curiam.An Ohio jury convicted respondent Harry Mitts on two counts of aggravated murder and two counts of attempted murder. He was sentenced to death. At issue here is part of the jury instructions given during the penalty phase of Mitts’s trial. The instructions, in pertinent part, were as follows:“[Y]ou must determine beyond a reasonable doubt whether the aggravating circumstances, which [Mitts] was found guilty of committing in the separate counts, are sufficient to outweigh the mitigating factors you find are present in this case.“When all members of the jury find by proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circumstances in each separate count with which [Mitts] has been found guilty of committing outweigh the mitigating factors, if any, then you must return such finding to the Court.“I instruct you as a matter of law that if you make such a finding, then you must recommend to the Court that the sentence of death be imposed on [Mitts].. . . . .“On the other hand, [if] after considering all the relevant evidence raised at trial, the evidence and testimony received at this hearing and the arguments of counsel, you find that the state of Ohio failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circumstances with which [Mitts] was found guilty of committing outweigh the mitigating factors, you will then proceed to determine which of two possible life imprisonment sentences to recommend to the Court.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 352a–353a.We considered virtually the same Ohio jury instructions last Term inSmithv.Spisak, U. S., at 7). SeeMittsv.Bagley, F. 3d , ( ) (noting that the “instructions in this case are the same Ohio instructions that were given in”Spisak). That case, like this one, involved review of a federal habeas petition under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of (AEDPA). AEDPA provides, as relevant here, that relief may not be granted unless the state court adjudication “resulted in a decision that was contrary to . . . clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.” U. S. C. §(d)(1).InSpisak, we reversed a Court of Appeals decision that had found these instructions invalid under our decision inMillsv.Maryland, U. S. (). See U. S., at 8–9). Up until our decision inSpisak, Mitts had also pressed the claim that the instructions were invalid underMills. AfterSpisakrejected that claim, the Court of Appeals in this case determined that the instructions were contrary to our decision inBeckv.Alabama, U. S. (), and accordingly vacated Mitts’s death sentence. See F. 3d, at .InBeck, we held that the death penalty may not be imposed “when the jury was not permitted to consider a verdict of guilt of a lesser included non-capital offense, and when the evidence would have supported such a verdict.” U. S., at (internal quotation marks omitted). We explained that such a scheme intolerably enhances the “risk of an unwarranted conviction” because it “interjects irrelevant considerations into the factfinding process, diverting the jury’s attention from the central issue of whether the State has satisfied its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty of a capital crime.”Id., at , . “[F]orcing the jury to choose between conviction on the capital offense and acquittal,” we observed, “may encourage the jury to convict for an impermissible reason—its belief that the defendant is guilty of some serious crime and should be punished,” even when there is “some doubt with respect to an element” of the capital offense.Id., at , , . Because the scheme inBeckcreated a danger that the jury would resolve any doubts in favor of conviction, we concluded that it violated due process. Seeid., at , .According to the Court of Appeals below, the penalty phase instructions given at Mitts’s trial—and the Supreme Court of Ohio decision upholding their use—were “contrary to”Beck, because they “interposed before the jury the same false choice” that our holding inBeckprohibits. F. 3d, at , (internal quotation marks omitted). Referring to the instructions as “acquittal-first,” the Court of Appeals stated that they impermissibly required the jury to first decide whether to “acquit” Mitts of the death penalty before considering “mercy and some form of life imprisonment.”Id., at –. InterpretingBeckto stand for the proposition that “a jury instruction violates due process if it requires a mandatory death penalty sentence that can only be avoided by an acquittal before the jury has an opportunity to consider life imprisonment,” the Court of Appeals concluded that the instructions given during the penalty phase of Mitts’s trial unconstitutionally “deprived the jury of a meaningful opportunity to consider” a life sentence. F. 3d, at , (internal quotation marks omitted).The instructions here are surely not invalid under our decision inBeck. The concern addressed inBeckwas “the risk of an unwarrantedconviction” created when the jury is forced to choose between finding the defendant guilty of a capital offense and declaring him innocent of any wrongdoing. U. S., at (emphasis added);id., at ; see alsoSpazianov.Florida, U. S. , () (explaining that the “goal of theBeckrule” is “to eliminate the distortion of the factfinding process that is created when the jury is forced into an all-or-nothing choice between capital murder and innocence”);Schadv.Arizona, U. S. , () (“Our fundamental concern inBeckwas that a jury convinced that the defendant had committed some violent crime but not convinced that he was guilty of a capital crime might nonetheless vote for a capital conviction if the only alternative was to set the defendant free with no punishment at all”).The question here, however, concerns the penalty phase, not the guilt phase, and we have already concluded that the logic ofBeckis not directly applicable to penalty phase proceedings. InCaliforniav.Ramos, U. S. (), we rejected an argument thatBeckprohibited an instruction to “a capital sentencing jury regarding the Governor’s power to commute a sentence of life without possibility of parole.” U. S., at , –. In so doing, we noted the “fundamental difference between the nature of the guilt/innocence determination at issue inBeckand the nature of the life/death choice at the penalty phase.”Id., at . In light of that critical distinction, we observed that “the concern ofBeckregarding the risk of an unwarranted conviction is simply not directly translatable to the deliberative process in which the capital jury engages in determining the appropriate penalty.”Id., at ; see alsoSchad,supra, at (stating that the “central concern ofBecksimply is not implicated” when the “jury was not faced with an all-or-nothing choice between the offense of conviction (capital murder) and innocence”).The jurors in Mitts’s case could not have plausibly thought that if they declined to recommend the death penalty Mitts would “escape all penalties for his alleged participation in the crime.”Beck,supra, at . They had just convicted him on two counts of aggravated murder and two counts of attempted murder. They were specifically instructed that if they did not find that the aggravating factors outweighed the mitigating factors—and therefore did not recommend the death penalty—they would choose from two life sentence options. There is accordingly no reason to believe that the jurors in this case, unlike the jurors inBeck, could have been improperly influenced by a fear that a decision short of death would have resulted in Mitts walking free.We all but decided the question presented here inSpisakitself. After rejecting the contention that the Ohio instructions were contrary toMills, we noted that “the Court of Appeals found the jury instructions unconstitutional for an additional reason, that the instructions ‘require[d] the jury to unanimously reject a death sentence before considering other sentencing alternatives.’ ” U. S., at 9) (quotingSpisakv.Mitchell, F. 3d , ( )). That is essentially theBeckclaim presented here. See F. 3d, at (holding that a “jury instruction violates due process if it requires a mandatory death penalty sentence that can only be avoided by an acquittal before the jury has an opportunity to consider life imprisonment”). We rejected that claim inSpisakunder AEDPA, noting that “[w]e have not . . . previously held jury instructions unconstitutional for this reason.” U. S., at 9). Although neither the parties nor the courts below inSpisakhad citedBeck, a separate concurrence inSpisakwould have struck down the instructions in reliance on that decision. See U. S., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 3–6). The Court nonetheless concluded that whatever the merits of that argument on direct review, “the jury instructions at Spisak’s trial were not contrary to ‘clearly established Federal law’ ” under AEDPA.Id., at 9). The same conclusion applies here.The petition for certiorari and the motion for leave to proceedin forma pauperisare granted. The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit isReversed."}

Decided April , 2006Per Curiam.The Immigration and Nationality Act authorizes the Attorney General to grant an alien asylum if the alien cannot return to another country because of “persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.” §(a)()(A), as added, §, Stat. , 8 U. S. C. §(a)()(A) (emphasis added). The respondents, Michelle [REDACTED] and her immediate family, applied for asylum. They checked boxes on the application form that indicated their claim rested upon fear of persecution in their native South Africa because of (1) their “political opinion[s],” and (2) their “membership in a particular social group.” In proceedings before the Immigration Judge, they emphasized their fear of persecution because of their race (they are white) and their kinship with Michelle’s father-in-law, “Boss Ronnie,” a white South African who allegedly held racist views and mistreated black workers at the company at which he was a foreman. The Immigration Judge, focusing upon questions of race and political views, rejected their claim. And the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), responding to the Thomases’ primarily race-related arguments, summarily affirmed that decision.On review, a Ninth Circuit panel held by a 2-to-1 vote that the Board had not adequately considered the Thomases’ claim of persecution because of “membership in a particular social group, as relatives of Boss Ronnie.”Thomasv.Ashcroft, F. 3d , (). The Ninth Circuit took the matter en banc. The en banc court, overruling what it considered aberrant contrary Circuit precedent, unanimously held that in principle “a familymayconstitute a social group for the purposes of the refugee statutes.” F. 3d , () (en banc) (emphasis added) (overruling,inter alia,Estrada-Posadasv.INS, F. 2d ( )). In so doing, the court relied on earlier BIA opinions holding that certain “kinship ties” fall within the statutory term. Seeid., at , -.The court then went on to hold, over the dissent of four judges, that the particular family at issue, namely “ ‘persons related to Boss Ronnie,’ ” fell within the scope of the statutory term “particular social group” and that the “Thomases were attacked and threatened because they belonged to the particular social group of ‘persons related to Boss Ronnie’ ... .” F. 3d, at . The dissenting judges argued that the question “whether the Thomasesarea ‘particular social group’ ” should first be considered by the relevant administrative agency.Id., at (opinion of Rymer, J.) (emphasis in original). And they said that the majority’s contrary decision was inconsistent with this Court’s holding inINSv.Orlando Ventura, U. S. , ()(per curiam).The Solicitor General now asks us to grant certiorari to consider whether the Ninth Circuit “erred in holding, in the first instance and without prior resolution of the questions by the” relevant administrative agency, “that members of a family can and do constitute a ‘particular social group’ within the meaning of” the Act. Pet. for Cert. I. He argues that a court’s role in an immigration case is typically one of “ ‘review, not of first view.’ ”Id., at (quotingCutterv.Wilkinson, U. S. , , n. 7 ()). He adds that the decision clearly violates what this Court described inVenturaas the “ordinary ‘remand’ rule.” Pet. for Cert. (quotingVentura,supra, at ). And he concludes that “the Ninth Circuit’s error is so obvious in light ofVenturathat summary reversal would be appropriate.” Pet. for Cert. .We agree with the Solicitor General. The Ninth Circuit’s failure to remand is legally erroneous, and that error is “obvious in light ofVentura,” itself a summary reversal.The alien inVenturasought asylum on grounds of a reasonable fear of “persecution” in Guatemala “ ‘on account of ... [a] political opinion.’ ” U. S., at . The BIA held that the alien did not qualify for asylum because whatever persecution he faced when he left Guatemala in was not on account of a “ ‘political opinion.’ ”Ibid. The Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that the record showed that in the alien did indeed face politically based persecution in Guatemala. The Circuit then went on to consider the Government’s alternative argument—that, in any event, conditions within Guatemala had improved to the point that political persecution was no longer likely.Ibid. And the Circuit rejected this “ ‘changed circumstances’ ” claim without first giving the agency an opportunity to consider the matter.Id., at .We reversed the Ninth Circuit summarily. We pointed out that “[w]ithin broad limits the law entrusts the agency to make the basic asylum eligibility decision.”Id., at . “In such circumstances,” we added, a “ ‘judicial judgment cannot be made to do service for an administrative judgment.’ ”Ibid. (quotingSECv.Chenery Corp., U.

S., ()). Applying these “basic legal principles,” we concluded that “every consideration that classically supports the law’s ordinary remand requirement does so here.”Ventura, U. S., at , .We must reach the same conclusion in the present case. The agency has not yet considered whether Boss Ronnie’s family presents the kind of “kinship ties” that constitute a “particular social group.” The matter requires determining the facts and deciding whether the facts as found fall within a statutory term. And as we said inVentura:“The agency can bring its expertise to bear upon the matter; it can evaluate the evidence; it can make an initial determination; and, in doing so, it can, through informed discussion and analysis, help a court later determine whether its decision exceeds the leeway that the law provides.” Id., at .We can find no special circumstance here that might have justified the Ninth Circuit’s determination of the matter in the first instance. Thus, as inVentura,the Court of Appeals should have applied the “ordinary ‘remand’ rule.”Id., at .We grant the petition for certiorari. We vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals. And we remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered."}

C. §§(a) and (d)(2), alleging that Google was both directly and secondarily liable for the terrorist attack that killed Gonzalez.[2] For their secondary-liability claims, plaintiffs alleged that Google aided and abetted and conspired with ISIS. All of their claims broadly center on the use of YouTube, which Google owns and operates, by ISIS and ISIS supporters.The District Court dismissed plaintiffs’ complaint for failure to state a claim, though it offered plaintiffs leave to amend their complaint. Instead, plaintiffs stood on their complaint and appealed, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed in a consolidated opinion that also addressedTwitter,Inc.v. S. 2 F. 4th (). With respect to this case, the Ninth Circuit held that most of the plaintiffs’ claims were barred by § of the Communications Decency Act of , 110Stat. , U. S. C. §(c)(1). The sole exceptions were plaintiffs’ direct- and secondary-liability claims based on allegations that Google approved ISIS videos for advertisements and then shared proceeds with ISIS through YouTube’s revenue-sharing system. The Ninth Circuit held that these potential claims were not barred by §, but that plaintiffs’ allegations failed to state a viable claim in any event.We granted certiorari to review the Ninth Circuit’s application of §. See U. S. Plaintiffs did not seek review of the Ninth Circuit’s holdings regarding their revenue-sharing claims. In light of those unchallenged holdings and our disposition ofTwitter, on which we also granted certiorari and in which we today reverse the Ninth Circuit’s judgment, it has become clear that plaintiffs’ complaint—independent of §—states little if any claim for relief. As plaintiffs concede, the allegations underlying their secondary-liability claims are materially identical to those at issue inTwitter. See Tr. of Oral Arg. . Since we hold that the complaint in that case fails to state a claim for aiding and abetting under §(d)(2), it appears to follow that the complaint here likewise fails to state such a claim. And, in discussing plaintiffs’ revenue-sharing claims, the Ninth Circuit held that plaintiffs plausibly alleged neither that “Google reached an agreement with ISIS,” as required for conspiracy liability, nor that Google’s acts were “intended to intimidate or coerce a civilian population, or to influence or affect a government,” as required for a direct-liability claim under §(a). 2 F. 4th, at , .

Rather, we think it sufficient to acknowledge that much (if not all) of plaintiffs’ complaint seems to fail under either our decision inTwitteror the Ninth Circuit’s unchallenged holdings below. We therefore decline to address the application of § to a complaint that appears to state little, if any, plausible claim for relief. Instead, we vacate the judgment below and remand the case for the Ninth Circuit to consider plaintiffs’ complaint in light of our decision inTwitter.It is so ordered.“ISIS” is shorthand for the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria.

Decided June , 2017Per Curiam.Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of (AEDPA), a state prisoner is eligible for fed-eral habeas relief if the underlying state court merits ruling was “contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law” as determined by this Court. U. S. C. §(d)(1). In this case, the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit held that this demanding standard was met by a Virginia court’s application ofGrahamv.Florida, U. S. () . The question presented is whether the Court of Appeals erred in concluding that the state court’s ruling involved an unreasonable application of this Court’s holding.IOn July 6, , respondent Dennis LeBlanc raped a -year-old woman. He was at the time. In , a state trial court sentenced him to life in prison for his crimes. In the ’s, Virginia had, for felony offenders, abolished parole that followed a traditional framework. See Va. Code Ann. §.1–.1 (). As a form of replacement, Virginia enacted its so-called “geriatric release” program, which allows older inmates to receive conditional release under some circumstances.LeBlancv.Mathena, F. 3d , ( ) (citing Va. Code Ann. §.1–.).Seven years after respondent was sentenced, this Court decidedGrahamv.Florida.Grahamestablished that the Eighth Amendment prohibits juvenile offenders convicted of nonhomicide offenses from being sentenced to life without parole. While a “State is not required to guarantee eventual freedom to a juvenile offender convicted of a nonhomicide crime,” the Court held, it must “give defendants like Graham some meaningful opportunity to obtain release based on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation.” U. S., at . The Court inGrahamleft it to the States, “in the first instance, to explore the means and mechanisms for compliance” with theGrahamrule.Ibid.Respondent later filed a motion in state trial court—the Virginia Beach Circuit Court—seeking to vacate his sentence in light ofGraham. The trial court denied the motion. In so doing, it relied on the Supreme Court of Virginia’s decision inAngelv.Commonwealth, Va. , S. E. 2d (). TheAngelcourt held that Virginia’s geriatric release program satisfiesGraham’s requirement of parole for juvenile offenders. The statute establishing the program provides:“Any person serving a sentence imposed upon a conviction for a felony offense . . . (i) who has reached the age of sixty-five or older and who has served at least five years of the sentence imposed or (ii) who has reached the age of sixty or older and who has served at least ten years of the sentence imposed may petition the Parole Board for conditional release.” §.1–..TheAngelcourt explained that “[t]he regulations for conditional release under this statute provide that if the prisoner meets the qualifications for consideration contained in the statute, the factors used in the normal parole consideration process apply to conditional release decisions under this statute.” Va., at , S. E. 2d, at . The geriatric release program thus complied withGraham, theAngelcourt held, because it provided “the meaningful opportunity to obtain release based on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation required by the Eighth Amendment.” Va., at , S. E. 2d, at (internal quotation marks omitted).The Virginia Supreme Court, in reviewing the trial court’s ruling in the instant case, summarily denied respondent’s requests for appeal and for rehearing.In , respondent filed a federal habeas petition in the Eastern District of Virginia pursuant to U. S. C. §. A Magistrate Judge recommended dismissing the petition, but the District Court disagreed and granted the writ. The District Court explained that “there is no possibility that fairminded jurists could disagree that the state court’s decision conflicts wit[h] the dictates ofGraham.”LeBlancv.Mathena, WL , * (July 1, ).A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed, holding that the state trial court’s ruling was an unreasonable application ofGraham. F. 3d, at –. In the panel majority’s view, Virginia’s geriatric release program did not provide a meaningful opportunity for juvenile nonhomicide offenders to obtain release based on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation.Judge Niemeyer dissented. He criticized the majority for “fail[ing] to respect, in any meaningful way, the deference Congress requires federal courts to give state court decisions on postconviction review.”Id., at .The Commonwealth of Virginia petitioned for certiorari. The petition is now granted, and the judgment is reversed: The Virginia trial court did not unreasonably apply theGrahamrule.IIIn order for a state court’s decision to be an unreason-able application of this Court’s case law, the ruling must be “objectively unreasonable, not merely wrong; even clear error will not suffice.”Woodsv.Donald, U. S., at 4) (internal quotation marks omitted). In other words, a litigant must “show that the state court’s ruling . . . was so lacking in justification that there was an error well understood and comprehended in existing law beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.”Ibid.(internal quotation marks omitted). This is “meant to be” a difficult standard to meet.Harringtonv.Richter, U. S. , () .The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit erred by failing to accord the state court’s decision the deference owed under AEDPA.Grahamdid not decide that a geriatric release program like Virginia’s failed to satisfy the Eighth Amendment because that question was not presented. And it was not objectively unreasonable for the state court to conclude that, because the geriatric release program employed normal parole factors, it satisfiedGraham’s requirement that juveniles convicted of a nonhomicide crime have a meaningful opportunity to receive parole. The geriatric release program instructs Virginia’s Parole Board to consider factors like the “individual’s history . . . and the individual’s conduct . . . during incarceration,” as well as the prisoner’s “inter-personal relationships with staff and inmates” and “[c]hanges in attitude toward self and others.” See F. 3d, at – (Niemeyer, J., dissenting) (citing Virginia Parole Board Policy Manual 2–4 (Oct. )). Consideration of these factors could allow the Parole Board to order a former juvenile offender’s conditional release in light of his or her “demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation.”Graham, U. S., at . The state court thus did not diverge so far fromGraham’s dictates as to make it “so obvious that . . . there could be no ‘fairminded disagreement’ ” about whether the state court’s ruling conflicts with this Court’s case law.Whitev.Woodall, U. S., at ).“Perhaps the logical next step from”Grahamwould be to hold that a geriatric release program does not satisfy the Eighth Amendment, but “perhaps not.” U. S., at ).“[T]here are reasonable arguments on both sides.”Id., at –). With respect to petitioners, these include the arguments discussed above.Supra,at 4. With regards to respondent, these include the contentions that the Parole Board’s substantial discretion to deny geriatric release deprives juvenile nonhomicide offenders a meaningful opportunity to seek parole and that juveniles cannot seek geriatric release until they have spent at least four decades in prison.These arguments cannot be resolved on federal habeas review. Because this case arises “only in th[at] narrow context,” the Court “express[es] no view on the merits of the underlying” Eighth Amendment claim., at 7) (internal quotation marks omitted). Nor does the Court “suggest or imply that the underlying issue, if presented on direct review, would be insubstantial.”Marshallv.Rodgers, U. S., at 5). The Court today holds only that the Virginia trial court’s ruling, resting on the Virginia Supreme Court’s earlier ruling inAngel, was not objectively unreasonable in light of this Court’s current case law.IIIA proper respect for AEDPA’s high bar for habeas relief avoids unnecessarily “disturb[ing] the State’s significant interest in repose for concluded litigation, den[ying] soci-ety the right to punish some admitted offenders, and in-trud[ing] on state sovereignty to a degree matched by few exercises of federal judicial authority.”Harrington,supra, at (internal quotation marks omitted). The federalism interest implicated in AEDPA cases is of central relevance in this case, for the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit’s holding created the potential for significant discord in the Virginia sentencing process. Before today, Virginia courts were permitted to impose—and required to affirm—a sentence like respondent’s, while federal courts presented with the same fact pattern were required to grant ha-beas relief. Reversing the Court of Appeals’ decision in this case—rather than waiting until a more substantial split of authority develops—spares Virginia courts from having to confront this legal quagmire.For these reasons, the petition for certiorari and the motion for leave to proceedin forma pauperisare granted, and the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.It is so ordered."}

Decided December 2, 2013Per Curiam.When a taxpayer overpays his taxes, he is generally entitled to interest from the Government for the period between the payment and the ultimate refund. See U. S. C. §(a). That interest begins to run “from the date of overpayment.” §§(b)(1), (b)(2). But the Code does not define “the date of overpayment.”In this case, after the Internal Revenue Service advised Ford Motor Company that it had underpaid its taxes from until , Ford remitted a series of deposits to the IRS totaling $ million. Those deposits stopped the ac-crual of interest that Ford would otherwise owe once the audits were completed and the amount of its underpayment was finally determined. See §; Rev. Proc. –, –2 Cum. Bull. . Later, Ford requested that the IRS treat the deposits as advance payments of the additional tax that Ford owed. Eventually the parties determined that Ford had overpaid its taxes in the relevant years, thereby entitling Ford to a return of the over-payment as well as interest. But the parties disagreed about when the interest began to run under U. S. C. §(b)(1). Ford argued that “the date of overpayment” was the date that it first remitted the deposits to the IRS.Ibid.The Government countered that the date of overpayment was the date that Ford requested that the IRS treat the remittances as payments of tax. The difference between the parties’ competing interpretations of §(b) is worth some $ million.Ford sued the Government in Federal District Court, asserting jurisdiction under U. S. C. §(a)(1). The Government did not contest the court’s jurisdiction. See Brief in Opposition 3, n. 3. The District Court accepted the Government’s construction of §(b) and granted its motion for judgment on the pleadings. A panel of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed, concluding that § is a waiver of sovereign immunity that must be construed strictly in favor of the Government. Fed. Appx. ().Ford sought certiorari, arguing that the Sixth Circuit was wrong to give § a strict construction. In Ford’s view, it is U. S. C. §—not §—that waives the Government’s immunity from this suit, and §(b) is a substantive provision that should not be construed strictly. SeeGómez-Pérezv.Potter, U.S. , ();United Statesv.White Mountain Apache Tribe, U.S. , – (). In its response to Ford’s petition for certiorari, however, the Government contended for the first time that §(a)(1) does not apply at all to this suit; it argues that the only basis for jurisdiction, and “the only general waiver of sovereign immunity that encompasses [Ford’s] claim,” is the Tucker Act, U. S. C. §(a). Brief in Opposition 3, n. 3. Although the Government acquiesced in jurisdiction in the lower courts, if the Government is now correct that the Tucker Act applies to this suit, jurisdiction over this case was proper only in the United States Court of Federal Claims.

Decided February , 2006Per Curiam.Petitioners Anthony Ash and John Hithon were superintendents at a poultry plant owned and operated by respondent Tyson Foods, Inc. Petitioners, who are African-American, sought promotions to fill two open shift manager positions, but two white males were selected instead. Alleging that Tyson had discriminated on account of race, petitioners sued under Rev. Stat. §, U. S. C. §, and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of , Stat. , as amended, U. S. C. §2000eet seq.A trial proceeded in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama. At the close of the plaintiffs’ evidence, Tyson moved for judgment as a matter of law, see Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. (a). The District Court denied the motion, and the jury found for petitioners, awarding compensatory and punitive damages. The employer renewed its motion for judgment under Rule (b). The District Court granted the motion and, in the alternative, ordered a new trial as to both plaintiffs under Rule (c). App. to Pet. for Cert. 35a; see generallyUnitherm Food Systems, Inc.v.Swift-Eckrich, Inc., U. S., at 4–) (discussing Rule ).The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part. Fed. Appx. , ()(per curiam).As to Ash, the court affirmed the grant of the Rule (b) motion, deeming the trial evidence insufficient to show pretext (and thus insufficient to show unlawful discrimination) under the burden-shifting framework set forth inMcDonnell Douglas Corp.v.Green, U. S. (). Fed. Appx., at –. As to Hithon, the court reversed the Rule (b) ruling, finding there was enough evidence to go to the jury. The court, however, affirmed the District Court’s alternative remedy of a new trial under Rule (c), holding that the evidence supported neither the decision to grant punitive damages nor the amount of the compensatory award, and thus that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in ordering a new trial.Id., at .The judgment of the Court of Appeals, and the trial court rulings it affirmed, may be correct in the final analysis. In the course of its opinion, however, the Court of Appeals erred in two respects, requiring that its judgment now be vacated and the case remanded for further consideration.First, there was evidence that Tyson’s plant manager, who made the disputed hiring decisions, had referred on some occasions to each of the petitioners as “boy.” Petitioners argued this was evidence of discriminatory animus. The Court of Appeals disagreed, holding that “[w]hile the use of ‘boy’ when modified by a racial classification like ‘black’ or ‘white’ is evidence of discriminatory intent, the use of ‘boy’ alone is not evidence of discrimination.”Id.,at (citation omitted). Although it is true the disputed word will not always be evidence of racial animus, it does not follow that the term, standing alone, is always benign. The speaker’s meaning may depend on various factors including context, inflection, tone of voice, local custom, and historical usage. Insofar as the Court of Appeals held that modifiers or qualifications are necessary in all instances to render the disputed term probative of bias, the court’s decision is erroneous.Second, the Court of Appeals erred in articulating the standard for determining whether the asserted nondiscriminatory reasons for Tyson’s hiring decisions were pretextual. Petitioners had introduced evidence that their qualifications were superior to those of the two successful applicants. (Part of the employer’s defense was that the plant with the openings had performance problems and petitioners already worked there in a supervisory capacity.) The Court of Appeals, in finding petitioners’ evidence insufficient, cited one of its earlier precedents and stated: “Pretext can be established through comparing qualifications only when ‘the disparity in qualifications is so apparent as virtually to jump off the page and slap you in the face.’ ”Ibid.(quotingCooperv.Southern Co., F. 3d , ( )).Under this Court’s decisions, qualifications evidence may suffice, at least in some circumstances, to show pretext. SeePattersonv.McLean Credit Union, U. S. , – () (indicating a plaintiff “might seek to demonstrate that respondent’s claim to have promoted a better qualified applicant was pretextual by showing that she was in fact better qualified than the person chosen for the position”), superseded on other grounds by U. S. C. §(b);Texas Dept. of Community Affairsv.Burdine, U. S. , () (“The fact that a court may think that the employer misjudged the qualifications of the applicants does not in itself expose him to Title VII liability, although this may be probative of whether the employer’s reasons are pretexts for discrimination”); cf.Reevesv.Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc., U. S. , () (“[A] plaintiff’s prima facie case, combined with sufficient evidence to find that the employer’s asserted justification is false, may permit the trier of fact to conclude that the employer unlawfully discriminated”).The visual image of words jumping off the page to slap you (presumably a court) in the face is unhelpful and imprecise as an elaboration of the standard for inferring pretext from superior qualifications. Federal courts, including the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit in a decision it cited here, have articulated various other standards, see,e.g.,Cooper,supra,at (noting that “disparities in qualifications must be of such weight and significance that no reasonable person, in the exercise of impartial judgment, could have chosen the candidate selected over the plaintiff for the job in question” (internal quotation marks omitted));Raadv.Fairbanks North Star Borough School Dist., F. 3d , ( ) (holding that qualifications evidence standing alone may establish pretext where the plaintiff’s qualifications are “ ‘clearly superior’ ” to those of the selected job applicant);Akav.Washington Hospital Center, F. 3d , (CADC ) (en banc) (concluding the factfinder may infer pretext if “a reasonable employer would have found the plaintiff to be significantly better qualified for the job”), and in this case the Court of Appeals qualified its statement by suggesting that superior qualifications may be probative of pretext when combined with other evidence, see Fed. Appx., at . This is not the occasion to define more precisely what standard should govern pretext claims based on superior qualifications. Today’s decision, furthermore, should not be read to hold that petitioners’ evidence necessarily showed pretext. The District Court concluded otherwise. It suffices to say here that some formulation other than the test the Court of Appeals articulated in this case would better ensure that trial courts reach consistent results.The Court of Appeals should determine in the first instance whether the two aspects of its decision here determined to have been mistaken were essential to its holding. On these premises, certiorari is granted, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered."}

Decided January , 2010Per Curiam.After a jury trial in the Superior Court of DeKalb County, Georgia, petitioner Eric Presley was convicted of a cocaine trafficking offense. The conviction was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Georgia. Ga. , S. E. 2d (). Presley seeks certiorari, claiming his Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment right to a public trial was violated when the trial court excluded the public from thevoir direof prospective jurors. The Supreme Court of Georgia’s affirmance contravened this Court’s clear precedents. Certiorari and petitioner’s motion for leave to proceedin forma pauperisare now granted, and the judgment is reversed.Before selecting a jury in Presley’s trial, the trial court noticed a lone courtroom observer.Id.,at –, S. E. 2d, at . The court explained that prospective jurors were about to enter and instructed the man that he was not allowed in the courtroom and had to leave that floor of the courthouse entirely.Id.,at , S. E. 2d, at . The court then questioned the man and learned he was Presley’s uncle.Ibid.The court reiterated its instruction:“ ‘Well, you still can’t sit out in the audience with the jurors. You know, most of the afternoon actually we’re going to be picking a jury. And we may have a couple of pre-trial matters, so you’re welcome to come in after we ... complete selecting the jury this afternoon. But, otherwise, you would have to leave the sixth floor, because jurors will be all out in the hallway in a few moments. That applies to everybody who’s got a case.’ ”Ibid.Presley’s counsel objected to “ ‘the exclusion of the public from the courtroom,’ ” but the court explained, “ ‘[t]here just isn’t space for them to sit in the audience.’ ”Ibid.When Presley’s counsel requested “ ‘some accommodation,’ ” the court explained its ruling further:“ ‘Well, the uncle can certainly come back in once the trial starts. There’s no, really no need for the uncle to be present during jury selection... . [W]e have jurors coming up. Each of those rows will be occupied by jurors. And his uncle cannot sit and intermingle with members of the jury panel. But, when the trial starts, the opening statements and other matters, he can certainly come back into the courtroom.’ ”Ibid.After Presley was convicted, he moved for a new trial based on the exclusion of the public from the jurorvoir dire. At a hearing on the motion, Presley presented evidence showing that prospective jurors could have fit in the jury box and the remaining could have fit entirely on one side of the courtroom, leaving adequate room for the public. App. to Pet. for Cert. E–, E–. The trial court denied the motion, commenting that it preferred to seat jurors throughout the entirety of the courtroom, and “it’s up to the individual judge to decide . . . what’s comfortable.”Id.,E–. The court continued: “It’s totally up to my discretion whether or not I want family members in the courtroom to intermingle with the jurors and sit directly behind the jurors where they might overhear some inadvertent comment or conversation.”Id.,at E– to E–. On appeal, the Court of Appeals of Georgia agreed, finding “[t]here was no abuse of discretion here, when the trial court explained the need to exclude spectators at the voir dire stage of the proceedings and when members of the public were invited to return afterward.” Ga. App. , –, S. E. 2d , ().The Supreme Court of Georgia granted certiorari and affirmed, with two justices dissenting. After finding “the trial court certainly had an overriding interest in ensuring that potential jurors heard no inherently prejudicial remarks from observers during voir dire,” the Supreme Court of Georgia rejected Presley’s argument that the trial court was required to consider alternatives to closing the courtroom. Ga., at , , S. E. 2d, at . It noted that “the United States Supreme Court [has] not provide[d] clear guidance regarding whether a court must, sU. S.onte, advance its own alternatives to [closure],” and the court ruled that “Presley was obliged to present the court with any alternatives that he wished the court to consider.”Id.,at , S. E. 2d, at , . When no alternatives are offered, it concluded, “there is no abuse of discretion in the court’s failure to sU. S.onte advance its own alternatives.”Id.,at , S. E. 2d, at .This Court’s rulings with respect to the public trial right rest upon two different provisions of the Bill of Rights, both applicable to the States via the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Sixth Amendment directs, in relevant part, that “[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial ... .” The Court inIn re Oliver, U. S. , (), made it clear that this right extends to the States. The Sixth Amendment right, as the quoted language makes explicit, is the right of the accused.The Court has further held that the public trial right extends beyond the accused and can be invoked under the First Amendment.Press-Enterprise Co.v.Superior Court of Cal., Riverside Cty., U. S. ()(Press-Enterprise I). This requirement, too, is binding on the States.Ibid.The case now before the Court is brought under the Sixth Amendment, for it is the accused who invoked his right to a public trial. An initial question is whether the right to a public trial in criminal cases extends to the jury selection phase of trial, and in particular thevoir direof prospective jurors. In the First Amendment context that question was answered inPress-Enterprise I.Id., at . The Court there held that thevoir direof prospective jurors must be open to the public under the First Amendment. Later in the same Term asPress-Enterprise I, the Court considered a Sixth Amendment case concerning whether the public trial right extends to a pretrial hearing on a motion to suppress certain evidence.Wallerv.Georgia, U. S. (). TheWallerCourt relied heavily uponPress-Enterprise Iin finding that the Sixth Amendment right to a public trial extends beyond the actual proof at trial. It ruled that the pretrial suppression hearing must be open to the public because “there can be little doubt that the explicit Sixth Amendment right of the accused is no less protective of a public trial than the implicit First Amendment right of the press and public.” U. S., at .WhilePress-Enterprise Iwas heavily relied upon inWaller, the jury selection issue in the former case was resolved under the First, not the Sixth, Amendment.Press-Enterprise I,supra, at (Stevens, J., concurring) (“The constitutional protection for the right of access that the Court upholds today is found in the First Amendment, rather than the public trial provision of the Sixth” (footnote omitted)). In the instant case, the question then arises whether it is so well settled that the Sixth Amendment right extends to juryvoir direthat this Court may proceed by summary disposition.The point is well settled underPress-Enterprise IandWaller. The extent to which the First and Sixth Amendment public trial rights are coextensive is an open question, and it is not necessary here to speculate whether or in what circumstances the reach or protections of one might be greater than the other. Still, there is no legitimate reason, at least in the context of juror selection proceedings, to give one who asserts a First Amendment privilege greater rights to insist on public proceedings than the accused has. “Our cases have uniformly recognized the public-trial guarantee as one created for the benefit of the defendant.”Gannett Co.v.DePasquale, U. S. , (). There could be no explanation for barring the accused from raising a constitutional right that is unmistakably for his or her benefit. That rationale suffices to resolve the instant matter. The Supreme Court of Georgia was correct in assuming that the Sixth Amendment right to a public trial extends to thevoir direof prospective jurors.While the accused does have a right to insist that thevoir direof the jurors be public, there are exceptions to this general rule. “[T]he right to an open trial may give way in certain cases to other rights or interests, such as the defendant’s right to a fair trial or the government’s interest in inhibiting disclosure of sensitive information.”Waller, U. S.,at . “Such circumstances will be rare, however, and the balance of interests must be struck with special care.”Ibid. Wallerprovided standards for courts to apply before excluding the public from any stage of a criminal trial:“[T]he party seeking to close the hearing must advance an overriding interest that is likely to be prejudiced, the closure must be no broader than necessary to protect that interest, the trial court must consider reasonable alternatives to closing the proceeding, and it must make findings adequate to support the closure.”Id.,at .In upholding exclusion of the public at jurorvoir direin the instant case, the Supreme Court of Georgia concluded, despite our explicit statements to the contrary, that trial courts need not consider alternatives to closure absent an opposing party’s proffer of some alternatives. While the Supreme Court of Georgia concluded this was an open question under this Court’s precedents, the statement inWallerthat “the trial court must consider reasonable alternatives to closing the proceeding” settles the point.Ibid.If that statement leaves any room for doubt, the Court was more explicit inPress-Enterprise I:“Even with findings adequate to support closure, the trial court’s orders denying access tovoir diretestimony failed to consider whether alternatives were available to protect the interests of the prospective jurors that the trial court’s orders sought to guard. Absent consideration of alternatives to closure, the trial court could not constitutionally close thevoir dire.” U. S.,at .The conclusion that trial courts are required to consider alternatives to closure even when they are not offered by the parties is clear not only from this Court’s precedents but also from the premise that “[t]he process of juror selection is itself a matter of importance, not simply to the adversaries but to the criminal justice system.”Id.,at . The public has a right to be present whether or not any party has asserted the right. InPress-Enterprise I, for instance, neither the defendant nor the prosecution requested an open courtroom during jurorvoir direproceedings; in fact, both specifically argued in favor of keeping the transcript of the proceedings confidential.Id.,at –. The Court, nonetheless, found it was error to close the courtroom.Id.,at .Trial courts are obligated to take every reasonable measure to accommodate public attendance at criminal trials. Nothing in the record shows that the trial court could not have accommodated the public at Presley’s trial. Without knowing the precise circumstances, some possibilities include reserving one or more rows for the public; dividing the jury venire panel to reduce courtroom congestion; or instructing prospective jurors not to engage or interact with audience members.Petitioner also argues that, apart from failing to consider alternatives to closure, the trial court erred because it did not even identify any overriding interest likely to be prejudiced absent the closure ofvoir dire. There is some merit to this complaint. The generic risk of jurors overhearing prejudicial remarks, unsubstantiated by any specific threat or incident, is inherent whenever members of the public are present during the selection of jurors. If broad concerns of this sort were sufficient to override a defendant’s constitutional right to a public trial, a court could exclude the public from jury selection almost as a matter of course. As noted in the dissent below, “the majority’s reasoning permits the closure of voir dire inevery criminal caseconducted in this courtroom whenever the trial judge decides, for whatever reason, that he or she would prefer to fill the courtroom with potential jurors rather than spectators.” Ga., at , S. E. 2d, at (opinion of Sears, C. J.).There are no doubt circumstances where a judge could conclude that threats of improper communications with jurors or safety concerns are concrete enough to warrant closingvoir dire. But in those cases, the particular interest, and threat to that interest, must “be articulated along with findings specific enough that a reviewing court can determine whether the closure order was properly entered.”Press-Enterprise I, supra,at ; see alsoPress-Enterprise Co.v.Superior Court of Cal., County of Riverside, U. S. 1, () (“The First Amendment right of access cannot be overcome by the conclusory assertion that publicity might deprive the defendant of [the right to a fair trial]”).We need not rule on this second claim of error, because even assuming,arguendo, that the trial court had an overriding interest in closingvoir dire, it was still incumbent upon it to consider all reasonable alternatives to closure. It did not, and that is all this Court needs to decide.The Supreme Court of Georgia’s judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.It is so ordered."}
{"file_name": "per curiam_2009_30_558.json", "author": "per curiam", "year": 2009, "text": "–. Decided November , 2009Per Curiam.Petitioner George Porter is a veteran who was both wounded and decorated for his active participation in two major engagements during the Korean War; his combat service unfortunately left him a traumatized, changed man. His commanding officer’s moving description of those two battles was only a fraction of the mitigating evidence that his counsel failed to discover or present during the penalty phase of his trial in .In this federal postconviction proceeding, the District Court held that Porter’s lawyer’s failure to adduce that evidence violated his Sixth Amendment right to counsel and granted his application for a writ of habeas corpus. The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit reversed, on the ground that the Florida Supreme Court’s determination that Porter was not prejudiced by any deficient performance by his counsel was a reasonable application ofStricklandv.Washington, U. S. (). Like the District Court, we are persuaded that it was objectively unreasonable to conclude there was no reasonable probability the sentence would have been different if the sentencing judge and jury had heard the significant mitigation evidence that Porter’s counsel neither uncovered nor presented. We therefore grant the petition for certiorari in part and reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.[Footnote 1]IPorter was convicted of two counts of first-degree murder for the shooting of his former girlfriend, Evelyn Williams, and her boyfriend Walter Burrows. He was sentenced to death on the first count but not the second.In July , as his relationship with Williams was ending, Porter threatened to kill her and then left town. When he returned to Florida three months later, he attempted to see Williams but her mother told him that Williams did not want to see him. He drove past Williams’ house each of the two days prior to the shooting, and the night before the murder he visited Williams, who called the police. Porter then went to two cocktail lounges and spent the night with a friend, who testified Porter was quite drunk by p.m. Early the next morning, Porter shot Williams in her house. Burrows struggled with Porter and forced him outside where Porter shot him.Porter represented himself, with standby counsel, for most of the pretrial proceedings and during the beginning of his trial. Near the completion of the State’s case in chief, Porter pleaded guilty. He thereafter changed his mind about representing himself, and his standby counsel was appointed as his counsel for the penalty phase. During the penalty phase, the State attempted to prove four aggravating factors: Porter had been “previously convicted” of another violent felony (i.e., in Williams’ case, killing Burrows, and in his case, killing Williams);[Footnote 2] the murder was committed during a burglary; the murder was committed in a cold, calculated, and premeditated manner; and the murder was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel. The defense put on only one witness, Porter’s ex-wife, and read an excerpt from a deposition. The sum total of the mitigating evidence was inconsistent testimony about Porter’s behavior when intoxicated and testimony that Porter had a good relationship with his son. Although his lawyer told the jury that Porter “has other handicaps that weren’t apparent during the trial” and Porter was not “mentally healthy,” he did not put on any evidence related to Porter’s mental health. 3 Tr. – (Jan. , ).The jury recommended the death sentence for both murders. The trial court found that the State had proved all four aggravating circumstances for the murder of Williams but that only the first two were established with respect to Burrows’ murder. The trial court found no mitigating circumstances and imposed a death sentence for Williams’ murder only. On direct appeal, the Florida Supreme Court affirmed the sentence over the dissent of two justices, but struck the heinous, atrocious, or cruel aggravating factor.Porterv.State, So. 2d ()(per curiam). The court found the State had not carried its burden on that factor because the “record is consistent with the hypothesis that Porter’s was a crime of passion, not a crime that was meant to be deliberately and extraordinarily painful.”Id., at (emphasis deleted). The two dissenting justices would have reversed the penalty because the evidence of drunkenness, “combined with evidence of Porter’s emotionally charged, desperate, frustrated desire to meet with his former lover, is sufficient to render the death penalty disproportional punishment in this instance.”Id., at – (Barkett, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).In , Porter filed a petition for postconviction relief in state court, claiming his penalty-phase counsel failed to investigate and present mitigating evidence. The court conducted a 2-day evidentiary hearing, during which Porter presented extensive mitigating evidence, all of which was apparently unknown to his penalty-phase counsel. Unlike the evidence presented during Porter’s penalty hearing, which left the jury knowing hardly anything about him other than the facts of his crimes, the new evidence described his abusive childhood, his heroic military service and the trauma he suffered because of it, his long-term substance abuse, and his impaired mental health and mental capacity.The depositions of his brother and sister described the abuse Porter suffered as a child. Porter routinely witnessed his father beat his mother, one time so severely that she had to go to the hospital and lost a child. Porter’s father was violent every weekend, and by his siblings’ account, Porter was his father’s favorite target, particularly when Porter tried to protect his mother. On one occasion, Porter’s father shot at him for coming home late, but missed and just beat Porter instead. According to his brother, Porter attended classes for slow learners and left school when he was or .To escape his horrible family life, Porter enlisted in the Army at age and fought in the Korean War. His company commander, Lieutenant Colonel Sherman Pratt, testified at Porter’s postconviction hearing. Porter was with the 2d Division, which had advanced above the 38th parallel to Kunu-ri when it was attacked by Chinese forces. Porter suffered a gunshot wound to the leg during the advance but was with the unit for the battle at Kunu-ri. While the Eighth Army was withdrawing, the 2d Division was ordered to hold off the Chinese advance, enabling the bulk of the Eighth Army to live to fight another day. As Colonel Pratt described it, the unit “went into position there in bitter cold night, terribly worn out, terribly weary, almost like zombies because we had been in constant—for five days we had been in constant contact with the enemy fighting our way to the rear, little or no sleep, little or no food, literally as I say zombies.” 1 Tr. (Jan. 4, ). The next morning, the unit engaged in a “fierce hand-to-hand fight with the Chinese” and later that day received permission to withdraw, making Porter’s regiment the last unit of the Eighth Army to withdraw.Id., at –.Less than three months later, Porter fought in a second battle, at Chip’yong-ni. His regiment was cut off from the rest of the Eighth Army and defended itself for two days and two nights under constant fire. After the enemy broke through the perimeter and overtook defensive positions on high ground, Porter’s company was charged with retaking those positions. In the charge up the hill, the soldiers “were under direct open fire of the enemy forces on top of the hill. They immediately came under mortar, artillery, machine gun, and every other kind of fire you can imagine and they were just dropping like flies as they went along.”Id., at . Porter’s company lost all three of its platoon sergeants, and almost all of the officers were wounded. Porter was again wounded and his company sustained the heaviest losses of any troops in the battle, with more than % casualties. Colonel Pratt testified that these battles were “very trying, horrifying experiences,” particularly for Porter’s company at Chip’yong-ni.Id., at . Porter’s unit was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation for the engagement at Chip’yong-ni, and Porter individually received two Purple Hearts and the Combat Infantryman Badge, along with other decorations.Colonel Pratt testified that Porter went absent without leave (AWOL) for two periods while in Korea. He explained that this was not uncommon, as soldiers sometimes became disoriented and separated from the unit, and that the commander had decided not to impose any punishment for the absences. In Colonel Pratt’s experience, an “awful lot of [veterans] come back nervous wrecks. Our [veterans’] hospitals today are filled with people mentally trying to survive the perils and hardships [of] ... the Korean War,” particularly those who fought in the battles he described.Id., at .When Porter returned to the United States, he went AWOL for an extended period of time.[Footnote 3] He was sentenced to six months’ imprisonment for that infraction, but he received an honorable discharge. After his discharge, he suffered dreadful nightmares and would attempt to climb his bedroom walls with knives at night.[Footnote 4] Porter’s family eventually removed all of the knives from the house. According to Porter’s brother, Porter developed a serious drinking problem and began drinking so heavily that he would get into fights and not remember them at all.In addition to this testimony regarding his life history, Porter presented an expert in neuropsychology, Dr. Dee, who had examined Porter and administered a number of psychological assessments. Dr. Dee concluded that Porter suffered from brain damage that could manifest in impulsive, violent behavior. At the time of the crime, Dr. Dee testified, Porter was substantially impaired in his ability to conform his conduct to the law and suffered from an extreme mental or emotional disturbance, two statutory mitigating circumstances, Fla. Stat. §.(6). Dr. Dee also testified that Porter had substantial difficulties with reading, writing, and memory, and that these cognitive defects were present when he was evaluated for competency to stand trial. 2 Tr. – (Jan. 5, ); see also Record –. Although the State’s experts reached different conclusions regarding the statutory mitigators,[Footnote 5] each expert testified that he could not diagnose Porter or rule out a brain abnormality. 2 Tr. , (Jan. 5, ); 3id., at .The trial judge who conducted the state postconviction hearing, without determining counsel’s deficiency, held that Porter had not been prejudiced by the failure to introduce any of that evidence. Record , .He found that Porter had failed to establish any statutory mitigating circumstances,id., at , and that the nonstatutory mitigating evidence would not have made a difference in the outcome of the case,id., at . He discounted the evidence of Porter’s alcohol abuse because it was inconsistent and discounted the evidence of Porter’s abusive childhood because he was years old at the time of the trial. He also concluded that Porter’s periods of being AWOL would have reduced the impact of Porter’s military service to “inconsequential proportions.”Id., at . Finally, he held that even considering all three categories of evidence together, the “trial judge and jury still would have imposed death.”Id., at .The Florida Supreme Court affirmed. It first accepted the trial court’s finding that Porter could not have established any statutory mitigating circumstances, based on the trial court’s acceptance of the State’s experts’ conclusions in that regard.Porterv.State, So. 2d , ()(per curiam). It then held the trial court was correct to find “the additional nonstatutory mitigation to be lacking in weight because of the specific facts presented.”Id., at . Like the postconviction court, the Florida Supreme Court reserved judgment regarding counsel’s deficiency.Ibid.[Footnote 6]Two justices dissented, reasoning that counsel’s failure to investigate and present mitigating evidence was “especially harmful” because of the divided vote affirming the sentence on direct appeal—“even without the substantial mitigation that we now know existed”—and because of the reversal of the heinous, atrocious, and cruel aggravating factor.Id., at (Anstead, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).Porter thereafter filed his federal habeas petition. The District Court held Porter’s penalty-phase counsel had been ineffective. It first determined that counsel’s performance had been deficient because “penalty-phase counsel did little, if any investigation ... and failed to effectively advocate on behalf of his client before the jury.”Porterv.Crosby, No. 6:–cv––Orl–31KRS, WL , * (MD Fla., June , ). It then determined that counsel’s deficient performance was prejudicial, finding that the state court’s decision was contrary to clearly established law in part because the state court failed to consider the entirety of the evidence when reweighing the evidence in mitigation, including the trial evidence suggesting that “this was a crime of passion, that [Porter] was drinking heavily just hours before the murders, or that [Porter] had a good relationship with his son.”Id., at *.The Eleventh Circuit reversed. It held the District Court had failed to appropriately defer to the state court’s factual findings with respect to Porter’s alcohol abuse and his mental health. F. 3d , , ()(per curiam). The Court of Appeals then separately considered each category of mitigating evidence and held it was not unreasonable for the state court to discount each category as it did.Id., at . Porter petitioned for a writ of certiorari. We grant the petition and reverse with respect to the Court of Appeals’ disposition of Porter’s ineffective- assistance claim.IITo prevail underStrickland, Porter must show that his counsel’s deficient performance prejudiced him. To establish deficiency, Porter must show his “counsel’s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.” U. S., at . To establish prejudice, he “must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.”Id., at . Finally, Porter is entitled to relief only if the state court’s rejection of his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel was “contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of”Strickland, or it rested “on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.” U. S. C. §(d).Because the state court did not decide whether Porter’s counsel was deficient, we review this element of Porter’sStricklandclaimde novo.Rompillav.Beard, U. S. , (). It is unquestioned that under the prevailing professional norms at the time of Porter’s trial, counsel had an “obligation to conduct a thorough investigation of the defendant’s background.”Williamsv.Taylor, U. S. , (). The investigation conducted by Porter’s counsel clearly did not satisfy those norms.Although Porter had initially elected to represent himself, his standby counsel became his counsel for the penalty phase a little over a month prior to the sentencing proceeding before the jury. It was the first time this lawyer had represented a defendant during a penalty-phase proceeding. At the postconviction hearing, he testified that he had only one short meeting with Porter regarding the penalty phase. He did not obtain any of Porter’s school, medical, or military service records or interview any members of Porter’s family. InWigginsv.Smith, U. S. , , (), we held counsel “fell short of ... professional standards” for not expanding their investigation beyond the presentence investigation report and one set of records they obtained, particularly “in light of what counsel actually discovered” in the records. Here, counsel did not even take the first step of interviewing witnesses or requesting records. Cf.Bobbyv.Van Hook,ante, at 6–8 (holding performance not deficient when counsel gathered a substantial amount of information and then made a reasonable decision not to pursue additional sources);Strickland, U. S., at (“[Counsel’s] decision not to seek more character or psychological evidence than was already in hand was ... reasonable”). Beyond that, like the counsel inWiggins, he ignored pertinent avenues for investigation of which he should have been aware. The court-ordered competency evaluations, for example, collectively reported Porter’s very few years of regular school, his military service and wounds sustained in combat, and his father’s “over-disciplin[e].” Record –. As an explanation, counsel described Porter as fatalistic and uncooperative. But he acknowledged that although Porter instructed him not to speak with Porter’s ex-wife or son, Porter did not give him any other instructions limiting the witnesses he could interview.Counsel thus failed to uncover and present any evidence of Porter’s mental health or mental impairment, his family background, or his military service. The decision not to investigate did not reflect reasonable professional judgment.Wiggins,supra, at . Porter may have been fatalistic or uncooperative, but that does not obviate the need for defense counsel to conductsomesort of mitigation investigation. SeeRompilla,supra, at –.IIIBecause we find Porter’s counsel deficient, we must determine whether the Florida Supreme Court unreasonably appliedStricklandin holding Porter was not prejudiced by that deficiency. UnderStrickland, a defendant is prejudiced by his counsel’s deficient performance if “there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.” U. S., at . In Florida, the sentencing judge makes the determination as to the existence and weight of aggravating and mitigating circumstances and the punishment, Fla. Stat. §.(3), but he must give the jury verdict of life or death “great weight,”Tedderv.State, So. 2d , (Fla. )(per curiam). Porter must show that but for his counsel’s deficiency, there is a reasonable probability he would have received a different sentence. To assess that probability, we consider “the totality of the available mitigation evidence—both that adduced at trial, and the evidence adduced in the habeas proceeding”—and “reweig[h] it against the evidence in aggravation.”Williams,supra, at –.This is not a case in which the new evidence “would barely have altered the sentencing profile presented to the sentencing judge.”Strickland,supra, at . The judge and jury at Porter’s original sentencing heard almost nothing that would humanize Porter or allow them to accurately gauge his moral culpability. They learned about Porter’s turbulent relationship with Williams, his crimes, and almost nothing else. Had Porter’s counsel been effective, the judge and jury would have learned of the “kind of troubled history we have declared relevant to assessing a defendant’s moral culpability.”Wiggins,supra, at . They would have heard about (1) Porter’s heroic military service in two of the most critical—and horrific—battles of the Korean War, (2) his struggles to regain normality upon his return from war, (3) his childhood history of physical abuse, and (4) his brain abnormality, difficulty reading and writing, and limited schooling. SeePenryv.Lynaugh, U. S. , () (“ ‘[E]vidence about the defendant’s background and character is relevant because of the belief, long held by this society, that defendants who commit criminal acts that are attributable to a disadvantaged background ... may be less culpable’ ”). Instead, they heard absolutely none of that evidence, evidence which “might well have influenced the jury’s appraisal of [Porter’s] moral culpability.”Williams, U. S., at .On the other side of the ledger, the weight of evidence in aggravation is not as substantial as the sentencing judge thought. As noted, the sentencing judge accepted the jury’s recommendation of a death sentence for the murder of Williams but rejected the jury’s death-sentence recommendation for the murder of Burrows. The sentencing judge believed that there were four aggravating circumstances related to the Williams murder but only two for the Burrows murder. Accordingly, the judge must have reasoned that the two aggravating circumstances that were present in both cases were insufficient to warrant a death sentence but that the two additional aggravating circumstances present with respect to the Williams murder were sufficient to tip the balance in favor of a death sentence. But the Florida Supreme Court rejected one of these additional aggravating circumstances,i.e., that Williams’ murder was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel, finding the murder “consistent with ... a crime of passion” even though premeditated to a heightened degree. So. 2d, at –. Had the judge and jury been able to place Porter’s life history “on the mitigating side of the scale,” and appropriately reduced the ballast on the aggravating side of the scale, there is clearly a reasonable probability that the advisory jury—and the sentencing judge—“would have struck a different balance,”Wiggins, U. S., at , and it is unreasonable to conclude otherwise.The Florida Supreme Court’s decision that Porter was not prejudiced by his counsel’s failure to conduct a thorough—or even cursory—investigation is unreasonable. The Florida Supreme Court either did not consider or unreasonably discounted the mitigation evidence adduced in the postconviction hearing. Under Florida law, mental health evidence that does not rise to the level of establishing a statutory mitigating circumstance may nonetheless be considered by the sentencing judge and jury as mitigating. See,e.g.,Hoskinsv.State, So. 2d 1, – (Fla. )(per curiam). Indeed, the Constitution requires that “the sentencer in capital cases must be permitted to consider any relevant mitigating factor.”Eddingsv.Oklahoma, U. S. , (). Yet neither the postconviction trial court nor the Florida Supreme Court gave any consideration for the purpose of nonstatutory mitigation to Dr. Dee’s testimony regarding the existence of a brain abnormality and cognitive defects.[Footnote 7] While the State’s experts identified perceived problems with the tests that Dr. Dee used and the conclusions that he drew from them, it was not reasonable to discount entirely the effect that his testimony might have had on the jury or the sentencing judge.Furthermore, the Florida Supreme Court, following the state postconviction court, unreasonably discounted the evidence of Porter’s childhood abuse and military service. It is unreasonable to discount to irrelevance the evidence of Porter’s abusive childhood, especially when that kind of history may have particular salience for a jury evaluating Porter’s behavior in his relationship with Williams. It is also unreasonable to conclude that Porter’s military service would be reduced to “inconsequential proportions,” So. 2d, at , simply because the jury would also have learned that Porter went AWOL on more than one occasion. Our Nation has a long tradition of according leniency to veterans in recognition of their service, especially for those who fought on the front lines as Porter did.[Footnote 8] Moreover, the relevance of Porter’s extensive combat experience is not only that he served honorably under extreme hardship and gruesome conditions, but also that the jury might find mitigating the intense stress and mental and emotional toll that combat took on Porter.[Footnote 9] The evidence that he was AWOL is consistent with this theory of mitigation and does not impeach or diminish the evidence of his service. To conclude otherwise reflects a failure to engage with what Porter actually went through in Korea.As the two dissenting justices in the Florida Supreme Court reasoned, “there exists too much mitigating evidence that was not presented to now be ignored.”Id., at (Anstead, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Although the burden is on petitioner to show he was prejudiced by his counsel’s deficiency, the Florida Supreme Court’s conclusion that Porter failed to meet this burden was an unreasonable application of our clearly established law. We do not require a defendant to show “that counsel’s deficient conduct more likely than not altered the outcome” of his penalty proceeding, but rather that he establish “a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in [that] outcome.”Strickland, U. S., at –. This Porter has done.The petition for certiorari is granted in part, and the motion for leave to proceedin forma pauperisis granted. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.Footnote 1We deny the petition insofar as it challenges his conviction.Footnote 2It is an aggravating factor under Florida law that “[t]he defendant was previously convicted of another capital felony or of a felony involving the use or threat of violence to the person.” Fla. Stat. §.(5)(b) (). In Porter’s case, the State established that factor by reference to Porter’s contemporaneous convictions stemming from the same episode: two counts of murder and one count of aggravated assault. Tr. 5 (Mar. 4, ).Footnote 3Porter explained to one of the doctors who examined him for competency to stand trial that he went AWOL in order to spend time with his son. Record .Footnote 4Porter’s expert testified that these symptoms would “easily” warrant a diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). 2 Tr. (Jan. 5, ). PTSD is not uncommon among veterans returning from combat. See Hearing on Fiscal Year Budget for Veterans’ Programs before the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, 111th Cong., 1st Sess., () (uncorrected copy) (testimony of Eric K. Shinseki, Secretary of Veterans Affairs (VA), reporting that approximately percent of the Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans seeking treatment at a VA medical facility had been preliminarily diagnosed with PTSD).Footnote 5The State presented two experts, Dr. Riebsame and Dr. Kirkland. Neither of the State’s experts had examined Porter, but each testified that based upon their review of the record, Porter met neither statutory mitigating circumstance.Footnote 6The postconviction court stated defense counsel “was not ineffective for failing to pursue mental health evaluations and ... [Porter] has thus failed to show sufficient evidence that any statutory mitigators could have been presented.” Record . It is not at all clear whether this stray comment addressed counsel’s deficiency. If it did, then it was at most dicta, because the court expressly “decline[d] to make a determination regarding whether or not Defense Counsel was in fact deficient here.”Id., at . The Florida Supreme Court simply paraphrased the postconviction court when it stated “trial counsel’s decision not to pursue mental evaluations did not exceed the bounds for competent counsel.”Porterv.State, So. 2d , – ()(per curiam). But that court also expressly declined to answer the question of deficiency.Id., at .Footnote 7The Florida Supreme Court acknowledged that Porter had presented evidence of “statutory and nonstatutory mental mitigation,” So. 2d, at , but it did not consider Porter’s mental health evidence in its discussion of nonstatutory mitigating evidence,id., at .Footnote 8See Abbott, The Civil War and the Crime Wave of –, 1 Soc. Serv. Rev. , – () (discussing the movement to pardon or parole prisoners who were veterans of the Civil War); Rosenbaum, The Relationship Between War and Crime in the United States, J. Crim. L. & C. , – () (describing a study by the Wisconsin Board of Control that discussed the number of veterans imprisoned in the State and considered “the greater leniency that may be shown to ex-service men in court”).Footnote 9Cf. Cal. Penal Code Ann. §.9(a) (West Supp. ) (providing a special hearing for a person convicted of a crime “who alleges that he or she committed the offense as a result of post-traumatic stress disorder, substance abuse, or psychological problems stemming from service in a combat theater in the United States military”); Minn. Stat. §., Subd. () (providing for a special process at sentencing if the defendant is a veteran and has been diagnosed as having a mental illness by a qualified psychiatrist)."}

(), announced a new rule and, if so, whether it applies retroactively on collateral review. We do not answer these questions, however, because petitioner—a state prisoner seeking postconviction relief from the federal courts—failed to comply with the gatekeeping requirements of U. S. C. §(b). That failure deprived the District Court of jurisdiction to hear his claims. Accordingly, we vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand with instructions to direct the District Court to dismiss petitioner’s habeas corpus application for lack of jurisdiction.IOn October , , a Washington jury convicted petitioner Lonnie Burton of rape, robbery, and burglary. App. 3–4. The state trial court initially entered judgment and sentence on December , ( judgment). In that judgment, the court sentenced Burton to a total of months in prison.Statev.Burton, No. –6–I etc., WL , * (Wash. App., June 9, ). The trial court rested the -month sentence on two alternative grounds under Washington’s determinate sentencing scheme. First, it sentenced Burton to within-guidelines sentences for each offense— months for robbery, months for burglary, and months for rape—and directed that the sentences be served consecutively, for a total term of months.Id., at *. Under Washington’s “multiple offense policy,” imposition of consecutive sentences constitutes an “exceptional” sentence, Wash. Rev. Code §§9.94A.(), 9.94A.(1)(a) (),[Footnote 1] but the trial court justified such a sentence on the ground that running the three terms concurrently would result in a sentence “clearly too lenient” in light of the purposes of Washington’s sentencing scheme. See §9.94A.(2)(i).[Footnote 2] The second basis on which the court calculated a -month term was by running the sentences concurrently but imposing an exceptional sentence of months solely for the rape conviction—again on the ground that the total sentence would otherwise be “clearly too lenient.”Statev.Burton, WL , at *.After an unrelated prior conviction was overturned, Burton requested resentencing. Accordingly, over a year after the judgment, the trial court entered an amended judgment and sentence ( judgment), which, after recalculating Burton’s offender scores, imposed a new sentence that relied solely on an exceptional -month sentence for the rape conviction, run concurrently with the other two terms.Ibid.;App. . On direct review, the Washington Court of Appeals upheld Burton’s conviction,Statev.Burton,supra, a decision the Washington Supreme Court declined to review,Statev.Burton, Wash. 2d , P. 2d (), cert. denied, U. S. (). The State Court of Appeals remanded for resentencing, however, because the trial court’s exclusive reliance on the exceptional rape sentence decreased Burton’s potential early release credits, raising vindictiveness concerns.Statev.Burton, WL , at *.In response, on March , , the trial court entered a second amended judgment and sentence ( judgment). App. 3. In this judgment, the trial court recited the jury’s guilty verdicts,id.,at 3–4, and again imposed a -month sentence, reverting to its original basis for doing so—running the three within-guidelines sentences consecutively.Id.,at 7, –. Burton sought review of this sentence, but the Washington courts eventually rejected his challenges both on direct review and in state postconviction proceedings.Id.,at –; App. to Brief for Petitioner 1a–4a.On December , , while state review of his sentence was still pending, Burton filed a petition under U. S. C. § for a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington ( petition). App. . The standard form he filled out warned applicants that they must “ordinarily first exhaust ... available state court remedies as to each ground on which” they sought “action by the federal court,” or run the risk of being “barred from presenting additional grounds at a later date.”Id.,at –. Burton nonetheless challenged his custody only by disputing the constitutionality of his three convictions, not by pressing any sentencing claims. Where the form requested the “[d]ate of judgment of conviction,” Burton listed “Dec. , ,” corresponding roughly to the date of the judgment.Id.,at . The form asked whether the applicant had “any petition or appeal now pending in any court, either state or federal,as to the judgment under attack,” to which Burton answered “Yes,” explaining that “[the] sentence I received at resentencing is on direct appeal.”Id.,at (emphasis added).The District Court denied relief,id.,at , and the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed,Burtonv.Walter, Fed. Appx. (), cert. denied, U. S. ().Over three years subsequent to filing the petition, after the Washington courts had rejected his sentencing challenges, Burton filed another federal habeas petition ( petition), again in the Western District of Washington. This time, Burton claimed to be contesting the judgment, and challenged only the constitutionality of his sentence. In particular, he alleged that it violated our decision inApprendiv.New Jersey, U. S. (), to the extent the sentencing court departed from a standard sentence based on its own factual determinations. The District Court again denied the petition, App. , and the Ninth Circuit again affirmed,Burtonv.Waddington, Fed. Appx. (). Both courts rejected the State’s contention that the District Court lacked jurisdiction to entertain the petition because Burton had not obtained an order from the Court of Appeals authorizing him to file a “second or successive” habeas petition, as required by the habeas gatekeeping provisions, U. S. C. §(b)(3). On the merits, the Ninth Circuit rejected Burton’sApprendiclaim and agreed with the State that Burton could not benefit fromBlakelyv.Washington, U. S. , because that decision announced a new rule that did not apply retroactively to Burton’s sentence. Fed. Appx., at .It is this petition, the petition, that is before us today. We conclude, though, that because the petition is a “second or successive” petition that Burton did not seek or obtain authorization to file in the District Court, the District Court never had jurisdiction to consider it in the first place.IIThe Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of (AEDPA) established a stringent set of procedures that a prisoner “in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court,” U. S. C. §(a), must follow if he wishes to file a “second or successive” habeas corpus application challenging that custody, §(b)(1). In pertinent part, before filing the application in the district court, a prisoner “shall move in the appropriate court of appeals for an order authorizing the district court to consider the application.” §(b)(3)(A). A three-judge panel of the court of appeals may authorize the filing of the second or successive application only if it presents a claim not previously raised that satisfies one of the two grounds articulated in §(b)(2). §(b)(3)(C);Gonzalezv.Crosby, U. S. , – (); see alsoFelkerv.Turpin, U. S. , –, ().Burton’s petition was a “second or successive” habeas application for which he did not seek, much less obtain, authorization to file. When Burton filed his first petition, the petition, he was being held in custody pursuant to the judgment, which had been entered some nine months earlier. When he filed his second petition, the petition, he was still being held in custody pursuant to the same judgment. In short, Burton twice brought claims contesting the same custody imposed by the same judgment of a state court. As a result, under AEDPA, he was required to receive authorization from the Court of Appeals before filing his second challenge. Because he did not do so, the District Court was without jurisdiction to entertain it.The Ninth Circuit determined that the petition was not “second or successive” because, underMcCleskeyv.Zant, U. S. (), Burton had a “legitimate excuse for failing to raise” his sentencing challenges in the petition. Fed. Appx., at (quotingMcCleskey,supra, at ; internal quotation marks omitted). Specifically, the Ninth Circuit reasoned that because Burton had not exhausted his sentencing claims in state court when he filed the petition, “they were not ripe for federal habeas review” at that time. Fed. Appx., at .We assume for purposes of this case, without deciding, that the Ninth Circuit’s “legitimate excuse” approach to determining whether a petition is “second or successive” is correct. That court’s ruling that Burton had a “legitimate excuse,” however, is inconsistent with the precise practice we have explained governs in circumstances such as Burton’s. The plurality opinion inRosev.Lundy, U. S. , – (), stated that district courts should dismiss “mixed petitions”—those with exhausted and unexhausted claims—and that petitioners with such petitions have two options. They may withdraw a mixed petition, exhaust the remaining claims, and return to district court with a fully exhausted petition. We have held that in such circumstances the later filed petition would not be “second or successive.”Slackv.McDaniel, U. S. , – ().Alternatively, prisoners filing mixed petitions may proceed with only the exhausted claims, but doing so risks subjecting later petitions that raise new claims to rigorous procedural obstacles.Lundy,supra, at – (plurality opinion); see alsoSlack,supra, at –. As noted, the form Burton used in filing his first petition warned of just that consequence. App. –,supra,at 3. There is no basis in our cases for supposing, as the Ninth Circuit did, that a petitioner with unexhausted claims who chooses the second of these options—who elects to proceed to adjudication of his exhausted claims—may later assert that a subsequent petition is not “second or successive” precisely because his new claims were unexhausted at the time he filed his first petition. This reasoning conflicts with bothLundyand §(b) and would allow prisoners to file separate habeas petitions in the not uncommon situation where a conviction is upheld but a sentence is reversed. Such a result would be inconsistent with both the exhaustion requirement, with its purpose of reducing “piecemeal litigation,”Duncanv.Walker, U. S. , (), and AEDPA, with its goal of “streamlining federal habeas proceedings.”Rhinesv.Weber, U. S. , ().Burton directs us to two decisions,Stewartv.Martinez-Villareal, U. S. (), andSlack,supra, in which we have not regarded subsequent petitions to be “second or successive.” But these cases are readily distinguishable. InMartinez-Villareal, we held that the claim of a capital prisoner that he was insane and therefore could not be put to death was necessarily unripe until the State issued a warrant for his execution, and so the prisoner’s subsequent request for consideration of that previously unripe claim was not “second or successive” for purposes of §(b). U. S., at –. But unlike Burton, the prisoner there had attempted to bring this claim in his initial habeas petition, prompting us to look toLundyin concluding that the claim “should be treated in the same manner as the claim of a petitioner who returns to a federal habeas court after exhausting state remedies,” that is, characterizing it as not “second or successive.”Martinez-Villareal, U. S., at . Indeed, we expressly declined to address the situation where a petitioner fails to raise the claim in the initial petition. Seeid., at , n. In this case, Burton did not raise the relevant claims in his petition. Without more, therefore, our holding inMartinez-Villarealdoes not support the conclusion that Burton’s petition was not “second or successive.”Slackis equally unhelpful to Burton; that decision merely confirmed that when a “first” petition is dismissed because it contains unexhausted claims, a prisoner returning later with a fully exhausted petition would not confront the “second or successive” bar. U. S., at –. We held that a “petition filed after a mixed petition has been dismissed underRosev.Lundybefore the district court adjudicated any claimsis to be treated as ‘any other first petition’ and is not a second or successive petition.”Id., at (emphasis added). See alsoid., at (“[A] habeas petition which is filed after an initial petition was dismissedwithout adjudication on the meritsfor failure to exhaust state remedies is not a ‘second or successive’ petition” (emphasis added)). Burton’s case is quite different—his first petition was not subject to dismissal as containing unexhausted claims, and in fact was adjudicated on the merits.Moving beyond the ground relied upon by the Ninth Circuit, Burton argues that his and petitions challenged different judgments. He notes that his petition identified the pertinent judgment as the judgment, App. , while the petition challenged the sentence imposed in the judgment. The judgment, however, had been entered nine months before Burton filed his first petition. That judgment, the same one challenged in the subsequent petition, was the judgment pursuant to which Burton was being detained. UnlikeIn re Taylor, F. 3d ( ), cited by Burton, there was no new judgment intervening between the two habeas petitions. In his petition, Burton specifically described his unexhausted sentencing claims as claims “as to the judgment under attack,” App. , belying any notion that those claims arose from a judgment distinct from the one challenged in .[Footnote 3]Burton finally contends that had he not filed the petition when he did, and instead waited until state review of his sentencing claims was complete, he risked losing the opportunity to challenge his conviction in federal court due to AEDPA’s 1-year statute of limitations. See §(d)(1). But this argument misreads AEDPA, which states that the limitations period applicable to “a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court” shall run from, as relevant here, “the date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.” §(d)(1)(A). “Final judgment in a criminal case means sentence. The sentence is the judgment.”Bermanv.United States, U. S. , (). Accordingly, Burton’s limitations period did not begin until both his convictionandsentence “became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review”—which occurred wellafterBurton filed his petition.Burton argues in rebuttal that this reasoning would necessarily mean the District Court lacked jurisdiction to consider the petition, but he is mistaken. Section (a) states that a district court “shall entertain” a habeas petition “in behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court.” When he filed the petition, Burton assuredly was “in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court”—even if, at that point, the judgment was not final for purposes of triggering AEDPA’s statute of limitations.The long and short of it is that Burton neither sought nor received authorization from the Court of Appeals before filing his petition, a “second or successive” petition challenging his custody, and so the District Court was without jurisdiction to entertain it. The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is therefore vacated, and the case is remanded with instructions to direct the District Court to dismiss the habeas petition for lack of jurisdiction.It is so ordered.Footnote 1As we noted inBlakelyv.Washington, U. S. , , n. 1 (), Washington has since amended and recodified its criminal code. Citations are to provisions in effect at the time of Burton’s sentencing.Footnote 2Specifically, the standard range sentences for rape, robbery, and burglary, if run concurrently, would have punished Burton as if he had committed only the rape.Statev.Burton, No. –6–I etc., WL , *–* (Wash. App., June 9, ).Footnote 3For the same reasons, Burton’s reliance onCastrov.United States, U. S. (), is misplaced. That case reversed a lower court’s recharacterization of a motion requesting a new trial pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure as a first habeas petition. Here Burton filed his first habeas petition as such in ; it involves no similar “recharacterization” to recognize that the judgment pursuant to which Burton was confined at the time was the same judgment that gave rise to the sentence later challenged in his second habeas petition."}

Decided June , 2013Per Curiam.Respondent Edward Schad was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death. After an extensive series of state- and federal-court proceedings concluded with this Court’s denial of respondent’s petitions for certiorari and for rehearing, the Ninth Circuit declined to issue its mandate as normally required by Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure (d)(2)(D). The Ninth Circuit instead,sua sponte, construed respondent’s motion to stay the mandate pending the Ninth Circuit’s decision in a separate en banc case as a motion to reconsider a motion that it had denied six months earlier. Based on its review of that previously rejected motion, the court issued a stay a few days before respondent’s scheduled execution. Even assuming, as we did inBellv.Thompson, U.S. (), that Rule (d)(2)(D) admits of any exceptions, the Ninth Circuit did not demonstrate that exceptional circumstances justified withholding its mandate. As a result, we conclude that the Ninth Circuit’s failure to issue its mandate constituted an abuse of discretion.IIn , an Arizona jury found respondent guilty of first-degree murder for the strangling of -year-old Lorimer Grove.[1] The court sentenced respondent to death. After respondent’s conviction and sentence were affirmed on direct review, seeStatev.Schad, Ariz. , P.2d (), andSchadv.Arizona, U.S. (), respondent again sought state habeas relief, alleging that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance at sentencing by failing to discover and present sufficient mitigating evidence. The state courts denied relief.In August , respondent sought federal habeas relief. He again raised a claim of ineffective assistance at sentencing for failure to present sufficient mitigating evidence. The District Court denied respondent’s request for an evidentiary hearing to present new mitigating evi- dence, concluding that respondent was not diligent in developing the evidence during his state habeas proceedings.Schadv.Schriro, F. Supp. 2d (Ariz. ). The District Court alternatively held that the proffered new evidence did not demonstrate that trial counsel’s performance was deficient.Id., at –. The Ninth Circuit affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded to the District Court for a hearing to determine whether respondent’s state habeas counsel was diligent in developing the state evidentiary record.Schadv.Ryan, F.3d (). Arizona petitioned for certiorari. This Court granted the petition, vacated the Ninth Circuit’s opinion, and remanded for further proceedings in light ofCullenv.Pinholster, U. S. SeeRyanv.Schad, U.

The Ninth Circuit subsequently denied a motion for rehearing and rehearing en banc on February , .On July , , respondent filed in the Ninth Circuit the first motion directly at issue in this case. This motion asked the court to vacate its judgment and remand to the District Court for additional proceedings in light of this Court’s decision inMartinezv.Ryan, U.S. 1().[2] The Ninth Circuit denied respondent’s motion on July , . Respondent then filed a petition for certiorari. This Court denied the petition on October 9, , U. S. U.

Arizona set an execution date of March 6, , which prompted respondent to file a motion for stay of execution on February , . The Ninth Circuit panel granted the motion on March 1, , with Judge Graber again noting her dissent.On March 4, , Arizona filed a petition for rehearing and rehearing en banc with the Ninth Circuit. The court denied the petition the same day, with eight judges dissenting in two separate opinions. F.3d ().On March 4, Arizona filed an application to vacate the stay of execution in this Court, along with a petition for certiorari. This Court denied the application, with Jus- tices [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] noting that they would grant it. U. S. We now consider the petition.IIFederal Rule of Appellate Procedure (d)(2)(D) sets forth the default rule that “[t]he court of appealsmustissue the mandate immediatelywhen a copy of a Supreme Court order denying the petition for writ of certiorari is filed.” (Emphasis added.) The reason for this Rule is straightforward: “[T]he stay of mandate is entered solely to allow this Court time to consider a petition for certio- rari.”Bell, U. S.,at . Hence, once this Court has denied a petition, there is generally no need for further action from the lower courts. Seeibid.(“[A] decision by this Court denying discretionary review usually signals the end of litigation”). InBell, Tennessee argued that Rule (d)(2)(D) “admits of no exceptions, so the mandate should have issued on the date” the Court of Appeals received notice of the Supreme Court’s denial of certiorari.Id., at . There was no need to resolve this issue inBellbecause we concluded that the Sixth Circuit had abused its discretion even if Rule (d)(2)(D) authorized a stay of the mandate after denial of certiorari.Id., at –. As inBell, we need not resolve this issue to determine that the Ninth Circuit abused its discretion here.Bellrecognized that when state-court judgments are reviewed in federal habeas proceedings, “finality and comity concerns,” based in principles of federalism, demand that federal courts “accord the appropriate level of respect to” state judgments by allowing them to be enforced when federal proceedings conclude.Id.,at –. As we noted, States have an “ ‘ “interest in the finality of convictions that have survived direct review within the state court system.” ’ ”Id.,at (quotingCalderonv.Thompson, U.S. , (), in turn quotingBrechtv.Abrahamson, U.S. , ()). Elsewhere, we explained that “ ‘the profound interests in repose’ attaching to the mandate of a court of appeals” dictate that “the power [to withdraw the mandate] can be exercised only in extraordinary circumstances.”Calderon,supra, at (quoting C. Wright, A. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure §, p. (2d ed. )). Deviation from normal mandate procedures is a power “of last resort, to be held in reserve against grave, unforeseen contingencies.”Calderon,supra,at . Even assuming a court of appeals has authority to do so, it abuses its discretion when it refuses to issue the mandate once the Supreme Court has acted on the petition, unless extraordinary circumstances justify that action.Applying this standard inBell, we found no extraordinary circumstances that could constitute a miscarriage of justice. There, a capital defendant unsuccessfully alleged in state postconviction proceedings that his trial counsel had been ineffective by failing to introduce sufficient mitigating evidence in the penalty phase of trial. U. S., at . On federal habeas review, he made the same argument.Id.,at . After the Sixth Circuit affirmed, the defendant filed a petition for rehearing that “placed substantial emphasis” on his argument that the Sixth Circuit had overlooked new psychiatrist evidence.Id.,at .While the Sixth Circuit denied the petition, it stayed the issuance of its mandate while the defendant sought certiorari and, later, rehearing from the denial of the writ.Ibid.When this Court denied the petition for rehearing, the Sixth Circuit did not issue its mandate. Instead, the Sixth Circuit waited five months (and until two days before the scheduled execution) to issue an amended opinion that va- cated the District Court’s denial of habeas and remanded for an evidentiary hearing on the ineffective-assistance- of-counsel claim.Id.,at –. This Court reversed that decision, holding that the Sixth Circuit had abused its discretion due to its delay in issuing the mandate without notifying the parties, its reliance on a previously rejected argument, and its disregard of comity and federalism principles.In this case, the Ninth Circuit similarly abused its discretion when it did not issue the mandate. As inBell, the Ninth Circuit here declined to issue the mandate based on an argument it had considered and rejected months earlier. And, by the time of the Ninth Circuit’s February 1, , decision not to issue its mandate, it had been over months since we decidedMartinezand nearly 7 months since respondent unsuccessfully asked the Ninth Circuit to reconsider its decision in light ofMartinez.[3]Further, there is no doubt that the arguments presented in the rejected July , , motion were identical to those accepted by the Ninth Circuit the following February. Respondent styled his July motion a “Motion to Vacate Judgment and Remand to the District Court for Additional Proceedings in Light ofMartinezv.Ryan.” No. – (), Doc. , p. 1. As its title suggests, the only claim presented in that motion was that respondent’s postconviction counsel should have developed more evidence to support his ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim. Here, as inBell, respondent’s July motion “pressed the same arguments that eventually were adopted by the Court of Appeals.” U. S.,at . These ar- guments were pressed so strongly in the July motion that “[i]t is difficult to see how . . . counsel could have been clearer.”Id.,at . The Ninth Circuit had a full “opportunity to consider these arguments” but declined to do so,id., at , which “support[s] our determination that the decision to withhold the mandate was in error.”Id.,at –. We presume that the Ninth Circuit carefully considers each motion a capital defendant presents on habeas review. Seeid., at (rejecting the notion that “judges cannot be relied upon to read past the first page of a petition for rehearing”). As a result, there is no indication that there were any extraordinary circumstances here that called for the court to revisit an argumentsua spontethat it already explicitly rejected.Finally, this case presents an additional issue not present inBell. In refusing to issue the mandate, the Ninth Circuit panel relied heavily uponBeardsleev.Brown, F.3d , ( ) (per curiam),Beardslee, which precedes ourBelldecision by more than six months, asserts the Ninth Circuit’s inherent authority to withhold a mandate. See App. to Pet. for Cert. A–3 to A–4, WL , *1. ButBeardsleewas based on the Sixth Circuit’s decision inBell, which we reversed. SeeBeardslee,supra, at (citingThompsonv.Bell, F.3d , – ()). That opinion, thus, provides no support for the Ninth Circuit’s decision.In light of the foregoing, we hold that the Ninth Circuit abused its discretion when it neglected to issue its mandate. The petition for a writ of certiorari and respondent’s motion to proceedin forma pauperisare granted. The Ninth Circuit’s judgment is reversed, the stay of execution is vacated, and the case is remanded with instructions to issue the mandate immediately and without any further proceedings.It is so ordered.Notes1A state habeas court vacated an earlier guilty verdict and death sentence due to an error in jury instructions. SeeStatev.Schad, Ariz. , P.2d ().2Martinez, U.S. 1, was decided on March , . We are un-aware of any explanation for respondent’s delay in bringing hisMartinez-based argument to the Ninth Circuit’s attention.3Respondent did not even present the motion that the Ninth Circuit ultimately reinstated until more than 4 months after the Ninth Circuit denied respondent’s request for panel rehearing and rehearing en banc and more than ⁄2 months afterMartinezwas decided."}

We then set out three considerations that “inform the requisite analysis.”Ibid.First, we pointed out that the “duty of prudence, under ERISA as under the common law of trusts, does not require a fiduciary to break the law.”Ibid.Accordingly, “ERISA’s duty of prudence cannot require” the fiduciary of an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) “to perform an action—such as divesting the fund’s holdings of the employer’s stock on the basis of inside information—that would violate the securities laws.”Ibid.We then added that, where a complaint “faults fiduciaries for failing to decide, on the basis of the inside information, to refrain from making additional stock purchases or for failing to disclose that information to the public so that the stock would no longer be overvalued, additional considerations arise.”Id.,at . In such cases, “[t]he courts should consider the extent to which an ERISA-based obligation either to refrain on the basis of inside information from making a planned trade or to disclose inside information to the public could conflict with the complex insider trading and corporate disclosure requirements imposed by the federal securities laws or with the objectives of those laws.”Ibid.We noted that the “U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission ha[d] not advised us of its views on these matters, and we believe[d] those views may well be relevant.”Ibid.Third, and finally, we said that “lower courts faced with such claims should also consider whether the complaint has plausibly alleged that a prudent fiduciary in the defendant’s position could not have concluded that stopping purchases—which the market might take as a sign that insider fiduciaries viewed the employer’s stock as a bad investment—or publicly disclosing negative information would do more harm than good to the fund by causing a drop in the stock price and a concomitant drop in the value of the stock already held by the fund.”Id.,at –.The question presented in this case concerned what it takes to plausibly allege an alternative action “that a prudent fiduciary in the same circumstances would not have viewed as more likely to harm the fund than to help it.”Id.,at . It asked whetherDudenhoeffer’s “ ‘more harm than good’ pleading standard can be satisfied by generalized allegations that the harm of an inevitable disclosure of an alleged fraud generally increases over time.” Pet. for Cert. i.In their briefing on the merits, however, the petitioners (fiduciaries of the ESOP at issue here) and the Government (presenting the views of the Securities and Exchange Commission as well as the Department of Labor), focused their arguments primarily upon other matters. The petitioners argued that ERISA imposes no duty on an ESOP fiduciary to act on inside information. And the Government argued that an ERISA-based duty to disclose inside information that is not otherwise required to be disclosed by the securities laws would “conflict” at least with “objectives of ” the “complex insider trading and corporate disclosure requirements imposed by the federal securities laws . . . .”Dudenhoeffer, U. S., at .The Second Circuit “did not address the[se] argument[s], and, for that reason, neither shall we.”F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd.v.Empagran S. A., U.S. , () (citation omitted); seeCutterv.Wilkinson, U.S. , , n. 7 () (“[W]e are a court of review, not of first view”). See also F.3d ( ). Nevertheless, in light of our statement inDudenhoefferthat the views of the “U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission” might “well be relevant” to discerning the content of ERISA’s duty of prudence in this context, U.

We granted certiorari in this case to consider whether the Fifth Circuit properly applied these principles. It did not. We therefore vacate that court’s judgment and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.IIn , Sylvia Gonzalez ran for a seat on the city council of Castle Hills, a small town in southern Texas. While she was on the campaign trail, Gonzalez heard multiple complaints about the city manager, Ryan Rapelye. As city manager, Rapelye was responsible for, among other things, enforcing the city’s laws and managing its budget.Gonzalez was elected in May . Her first act in office was to help gather signatures for a petition seeking Rapelye’s removal. Eventually, over residents signed the petition. The petition was introduced at the next city council meeting, where discussions grew heated after various residents rose to Rapelye’s defense and spoke against Gonzalez. The discussion over the petition continued the next day.At the end of the second day, Gonzalez was packing up her belongings when the mayor, Edward Trevino, II, asked her for the petition. Gonzalez indicated that the petition was in Trevino’s possession, which he denied. He then asked Gonzalez to check her binder, where she found the petition. Gonzalez claims that she “did not intentionally put the petition in her binder,” and that she was “surprise[d]” to find it there. Complaint and Jury Demand in No. 5:–cv– (WD Tex., Sept. 9, ), ECF Doc. 1, p. .Trevino brought this incident to the city police’s attention, and an investigation into these events soon began. Within a month, a private attorney tasked with leading the investigation concluded that Gonzalez had likely violated a Texas anti-tampering statute that, among other things, prohibits a person from intentionally “remov[ing] . . . a governmental record.” Tex. Penal Code Ann. §§.(a)(3), (c)(1) (West Cum. Supp. ).[1]On the private attorney’s request, a local Magistrate granted a warrant for Gonzalez’s arrest. When she heard the news, Gonzalez turned herself in and spent an evening in jail. The district attorney ultimately dismissed the charges. Gonzalez claims that this episode has convinced her to step away from political life.Gonzalez brought suit under U. S. C. §, in Federal District Court against Trevino along with the police chief and the private attorney in their individual capacities.[2] Her complaint alleged that she was arrested in retaliation for her role in organizing the petition for Rapelye’s removal and that the defendants therefore violated her First Amendment rights.To bolster her claim, Gonzalez alleged that she had reviewed the past decade’s misdemeanor and felony data for Bexar County (where Castle Hills is located) and that her review had found that the Texas anti-tampering statute had never been used in the county “to criminally charge someone for trying to steal a nonbinding or expressive document.” ECF Doc. 1, at . Gonzalez’s search turned up felony indictments, and she characterized the typical indictment as involving “accusations of either using or making fake government identification documents.”Ibid. Other felony indictments included ones for fake checks, hiding murder evidence, or cheating on government exams. Every misdemeanor case, according to Gonzalez, involved “fake social security numbers, driver’s licenses, [or] green cards.”Ibid. Gonzalez pointed to this research as evidence that the defendants had engaged in a political vendetta by bringing a “sham charge” against her.Id., at .The defendants moved to dismiss the complaint. They argued that the presence of probable cause defeated Gonzalez’s retaliatory-arrest claims against the individual defendants. The District Court denied the defendants’ motion. Although Gonzalez conceded that probable cause supported her arrest, the court allowed her claim to advance after finding that it fell within an exception to the no-probable-cause rule that we recognized inNieves.Gonzalezv.Castle Hills, WL , *5, n. 7 (WD Tex., Mar. , ).The Fifth Circuit reversed that decision on appeal. The court thought that a plaintiff ’s claim could fall within theNievesexception only if the plaintiff proffered “comparative evidence” of “otherwise similarly situated individuals who engaged in the same criminal conduct but were not arrested.” F. 4th , () (internal quotation marks omitted). Gonzalez’s claim failed because she did not provide such evidence.We granted certiorari. U. S.IIGonzalez seeks reversal on two grounds. First, she asks us to reject the Fifth Circuit’s rule that plaintiffs must use specific comparator evidence to demonstrate that they fall within theNievesexception. Second, Gonzalez contends that theNievesno-probable-cause rule applies only to claims predicated on split-second arrests, rather than deliberative ones.We agree with Gonzalez that the Fifth Circuit took an overly cramped view ofNieves. That court thought Gonzalez had to provide very specific comparator evidence—that is, examples of identifiable people who “mishandled a government petition” in the same way Gonzalez did but were not arrested. F. 4th, at . Although theNievesexception is slim, the demand for virtually identical and identifiable comparators goes too far.We recognized theNievesexception to account for “circumstances where officers have probable cause to make arrests, but typically exercise their discretion not to do so.” U. S., at . To fall within the exception, a plaintiff must produce evidence to prove that his arrest occurred in such circumstances. The only express limit we placed on the sort of evidence a plaintiff may present for that purpose is that it must be objective in order to avoid “the significant problems that would arise from reviewing police conduct under a purely subjective standard.”Id., at .Here, Gonzalez provided that sort of evidence. She was charged with intentionally “remov[ing] . . . a governmental record.” Tex. Penal Code Ann. §.(a)(3). Gonzalez’s survey is a permissible type of evidence because the fact that no one has ever been arrested for engaging in a certain kind of conduct—especially when the criminal prohibition is longstanding and the conduct at issue is not novel—makes it more likely that an officerhasdeclined to arrest someone for engaging in such conduct in the past.Because we agree with Gonzalez’s first argument, we do not need to reach her second. We vacate the judgment below and remand the case for the lower courts to assess whether Gonzalez’s evidence suffices to satisfy theNievesexception.It is so ordered.Notes1The statute also prohibits a person from intentionally “destroy[ing],” “conceal[ing],” or “otherwise impair[ing] the verity, legibility, or availability” of a governmental record.2She also pressed a claim in this action against Castle Hills. That claim is not before us."}
{"file_name": "per curiam_2023_22-714_598.json", "author": "per curiam", "year": 2023, "text": "–. Decided May , 2023Per Curiam.The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) brought an enforcement action against petitioner, the former CEO of a Michigan-based community bank, for mismanaging one of the bank’s loan relationships in the wake of the “Great Recession” of –. After proceedings before the agency concluded, the FDIC ordered petitioner removed from office, prohibited him from further banking activities, and assessed $, in civil penalties. Petitioner subsequently filed a petition for review in the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. That court determined that the FDIC had made two legal errors in adjudicating petitioner’s case. But instead of remanding the matter back to the agency, the Sixth Circuit conducted its own review of the record and concluded that substantial evidence supported the agency’s decision.That was error. It is “a simple but fundamental rule of administrative law” that reviewing courts “must judge the propriety of [agency] action solely by the grounds invoked by the agency.”SECv.Chenery Corp., U.S. , (). “[A]n agency’s discretionary order [may] be upheld,” in other words, only “on the same basis articulated in the order by the agency itself.”Burlington Truck Lines, Inc.v.United States, U.S. , (). By affirming the FDIC’s sanctions against petitioner based on a legal rationale different from the one adopted by the FDIC, the Sixth Circuit violated these commands. We accordingly grant the petition for certiorari limited to the first question presented; reverse the judgment of the Sixth Circuit; and order that court to remand this matter to the FDIC so it may reconsider petitioner’s case anew in a manner consistent with this opinion.IUnder §8(e) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA), U. S. C. §(e), as amended by the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of , §, 103Stat. , the FDIC may remove and prohibit individuals from working in the banking sector if certain conditions are met. First, the FDIC must determine that an individual committed misconduct. That occurs when, as relevant here, the individual has “engaged or participated in any unsafe or unsound practice,” or breached his “fiduciary duty.” §§(e)(1)(A)(ii)–(iii). Second, the FDIC must find that a bank or its depositors were harmed, or that the individual personally benefited, “by reason of ” the individual’s misconduct. §(e)(1)(B). Finally, the individual’s misconduct must “involv[e] personal dishonesty” or “demonstrat[e] willful or continuing disregard . . . for the safety or soundness” of the bank. §(e)(1)(C).In this case, the FDIC brought an enforcement action under these provisions against petitioner Harry C. Calcutt, III. From to , Calcutt served as CEO of Northwestern Bank, headquartered in Traverse City, Michigan. During Calcutt’s tenure, the Bank developed a lending relationship with the Nielson Entities, a group of family-owned businesses that operate in the real estate and oil industries. In , the lending relationship—by then, the Bank’s biggest—began to sour. On September 1 of that year, facing financial difficulties due to the Great Recession, the Entities stopped paying their loans outright. At the time, they owed the Bank $ million.A few months later, the parties reached a multistep agreement known as the Bedrock Transaction to bring all of the Entities’ loans current. That agreement stabilized the Nielson lending relationship for the following year. But on September 1, , the Entities again stopped making their loan payments. Another short-term agreement was reached, allowing the Entities to continue servicing their debt for the next few months. But in January , the Entities once more stopped making their loan payments. They have remained in default ever since.On April , , the FDIC opened an investigation into the Bank’s officers for their role in the Nielson matter. The investigation concluded on August , , at which time the agency issued a notice of intention to remove petitioner as well as two other Bank executives from office, and to prohibit them from further participation in the banking industry. The agency also issued a notice of assessment of civil penalties. The bases for the proposed sanctions were the agency’s allegations that petitioner had, in violation of §(e), mishandled the Nielson Entities lending relationship in various ways: The Bedrock Transaction failed to comply with the Bank’s internal loan policy; the Bank’s board of directors was misled or misinformed of the nature of the Transaction; petitioner failed to respond accurately to FDIC inquiries about the Transaction; and the Transaction was misreported on the Bank’s financial statements.On October , , an FDIC Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) began a 7-day evidentiary hearing into petitioner’s conduct. Petitioner was among one of witnesses who testified. On April 3, , the ALJ issued his written decision, recommending that petitioner be barred from the banking industry and be assessed a $, civil penalty based on his mishandling of the Nielson Loan relationship. Petitioner appealed the ALJ’s decision to the FDIC Board.The FDIC Board began its review by determining, first, whether petitioner had engaged in an unsafe or unsound banking practice. Such a practice, according to the Board, “is one that is ‘contrary to generally accepted standards of prudent operation’ whose consequences are an ‘abnormal risk of loss or harm’ to a bank.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 150a (quotingMichaelv.FDIC, F.3d , ( )). The Board held that standard satisfied, concluding that “the record in this matter overwhelmingly establishes that [petitioner] engaged in numerous unsafe or unsound practices.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 150a.The Board then addressed the issue of causation. In doing so, the Board concluded that an individual “need not be the proximate cause of the harm to be held liable under section 8(e).”Id., at 160a. With that understanding in mind, the Board found that petitioner had caused the Bank harm in three ways: First, the Bank had to charge off (i.e., forgive) $, of one of the loans made in the Bedrock Transaction; second, the Bank suffered $6.4 million in losses on other Nielson Loans; and third, the Bank incurred investigative, auditing, and legal expenses in managing the Bedrock Transaction and its fallout.Id., at 159a–166a.Finally, the Board turned to the issue of culpability. It found that the record “well supported” the ALJ’s conclusions that petitioner “persistently concealed . . . the true common nature of the Nielson Entities Loan portfolio, [and] problems with that portfolio.”Id., at 167a–168a. The Board also found that petitioner “falsely answered questions presented to him during examinations,” “concealed documents showing the true condition of the loans,” and “falsely testified that Board members had been fully apprised of the nature of the Nielson Loan portfolio.”Ibid.Based on these findings, the Board issued a final decision imposing the penalties that the ALJ had recommended.Id., at 184a–185a.Petitioner then filed a petition for review in the Sixth Circuit, identifying several purported errors in the Board’s decision. Two are relevant here.First, petitioner contended that the Board had misapplied the FDIA’s “by reason of ” requirement by concluding that a showing of proximate cause was not needed. U. S. C. §(e)(1)(B). The Sixth Circuit agreed. The court “observed that [t]he Supreme Court has repeatedly and explicitly held that when Congress uses the phrase ‘by reason of ’ in a statute, it intends to require a showing of proximate cause.” F. 4th , () (some internal quotation marks omitted); see alsoibid.(citing for that propositionHemi Group, LLCv.City of New York, U.S. 1, 9 (), andHolmesv.Securities Investor Protection Corporation, U.S. , ()).Second, petitioner argued that he had not proximately caused the harms that the Board had identified or, in the alternative, that those harms did not qualify as harmful effects as a matter of law. See §(e)(1)(B). The Sixth Circuit agreed in part. Petitioner had indeed proximately caused the $, charge off on one of the Bedrock Transaction loans, the court held, because he had “participated extensively in negotiating and approving the Bedrock Transaction.” F. 4th, at . But the $6.4 million in losses on other Nielson Loans were a different matter. Petitioner could be held responsible only for “part” of that harm, the court explained, because “[t]he Bank probably would have incurredsomeloss no matter what Calcutt did.”Id., at . Finally, none of the investigative, auditing, and legal expenses incurred in dealing with the Nielson Entities could qualify as harms to the Bank, because those expenses occurred as part of the Bank’s “normal business.”Ibid.Despite identifying these legal errors in the Board’s analysis, the Sixth Circuit nevertheless affirmed the Board’s decision by a 2-to-1 vote. The court concluded that substantial evidence supported the Board’s sanctions determination, even though the Board never applied the proximate cause standard itself or considered whether the sanctions against Calcutt were warranted on the narrower set of harms that the Sixth Circuit identified. Seeid., at –.We now reverse.IIIt is a well-established maxim of administrative law that “[i]f the record before the agency does not support the agency action, [or] if the agency has not considered all relevant factors, . . . the proper course, except in rare circumstances, is to remand to the agency for additional investigation or explanation.”Florida Power & Light Co.v.Lorion, U.S. , (). A “reviewing court,” accordingly, “is not generally empowered to conduct ade novoinquiry into the matter being reviewed and to reach its own conclusions based on such an inquiry.”Ibid.For if the grounds propounded by the agency for its decision “are inadequate or improper, the court is powerless to affirm the administrative action by substituting what it considers to be a more adequate or proper basis.”Chenery, U. S., at ; see alsoSmithv.Berryhill, U. S., at ) (“Fundamental principles of administrative law . . . teach that a federal court generally goes astray if it decides a question that has been delegated to an agency if that agency has not first had a chance to address the question”).As both petitioner and the Solicitor General representing respondent agree, the Sixth Circuit should have followed the ordinary remand rule here. That court concluded the FDIC Board had made two legal errors in its opinion. The proper course for the Sixth Circuit after finding that the Board had erred was to remand the matter back to the FDIC for further consideration of petitioner’s case. “[T]he guiding principle, violated here, is that the function of the reviewing court ends when an error of law is laid bare.”FPCv.Idaho Power Co., U.S. , (); see alsoGonzalesv.[REDACTED], U.S. , () (per curiam) (remanding to agency based on failure by Court of Appeals to “appl[y] the ordinary remand rule” (internal quotation marks omitted));INSv.Orlando Ventura, U.S. , () (per curiam).The Sixth Circuit, for its part, believed that remand was unnecessary because it “would result in yet another agency proceeding that amounts to ‘an idle and useless formality.’ ” F. 4th, at (quotingNLRBv.Wyman-Gordon Co., U.S. , , n. 6 () (plurality opinion)). It is true that remand may be unwarranted in cases where “[t]here is not the slightest uncertainty as to the outcome” of the agency’s proceedings on remand.Id., at , n. 6. But we have applied that exception only in narrow circumstances. Where the agency “wasrequired” to take a particular action, we have observed, “[t]hat it provided a different rationale for the necessary result is no cause for upsetting its ruling.”Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc.v.Public Util. Dist. No. 1 of Snohomish Cty., U.S. , – ().That exception does not apply in this case. The FDIC was notrequiredto reach the result it did; the question whether to sanction petitioner—as well as the severity and type of any sanction that could be imposed—is a discretionary judgment. And that judgment is highly fact specific and contextual, given the number of factors relevant to petitioner’s ultimate culpability. To conclude, then, that any outcome in this case is foreordained is to deny the agency the flexibility in addressing issues in the banking sector as Congress has allowed.* * *The petition for writ of certiorari is granted limited to the first question presented. The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered."}
{"file_name": "per curiam_2011_23_565.json", "author": "per curiam", "year": 2011, "text": "–. Decided November 7, 2011Per Curiam.Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, a state prisoner seeking a writ of habeas corpus from a federal court “must show that the state court’s ruling on the claim being presented in federal court was so lacking in justification that there was an error well understood and comprehended in existing law beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.” Harrington v. Richter, U. S., at ). The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit purported to identify three such grievous errors in the Ohio Supreme Court’s affirmance of respondent Archie Dixon’s murder conviction. Because it is not clear that the Ohio Supreme Court erred at all, much less erred so transparently that no fairminded jurist could agree with that court’s decision, the Sixth Circuit’s judgment must be reversed.* * *Archie Dixon and Tim Hoffner murdered Chris Hammer in order to steal his car. Dixon and Hoffner beat Hammer, tied him up, and buried him alive, pushing the struggling Hammer down into his grave while they shoveled dirt on top of him. Dixon then used Hammer’s birth certificate and social security card to obtain a state identification card in Hammer’s name. After using that identification card to establish ownership of Hammer’s car, Dixon sold the vehicle for $2,.Hammer’s mother reported her son missing the day after his murder. While investigating Hammer’s disappearance, police had various encounters with Dixon, three of which are relevant here. On November 4, , a police detective spoke with Dixon at a local police station. It is undisputed that this was a chance encounter—Dixon was apparently visiting the police station to retrieve his own car, which had been impounded for a traffic violation. The detective issued Miranda warnings to Dixon and then asked to talk to him about Hammer’s disappearance. See Miranda v. Arizona, U.S. (). Dixon declined to answer questions without his lawyer present and left the station.As their investigation continued, police determined that Dixon had sold Hammer’s car and forged Hammer’s signature when cashing the check he received in that sale. Police arrested Dixon for forgery on the morning of November 9. Beginning at : a.m. detectives intermittently interrogated Dixon over several hours, speaking with him for about minutes total. Prior to the interrogation, the detectives had decided not to provide Dixon with Miranda warnings for fear that Dixon would again refuse to speak with them.Dixon readily admitted to obtaining the identification card in Hammer’s name and signing Hammer’s name on the check, but said that Hammer had given him permission to sell the car. Dixon claimed not to know where Hammer was, although he said he thought Hammer might have left for Tennessee. The detectives challenged the plausibility of Dixon’s tale and told Dixon that Tim Hoffner was providing them more useful information. At one point a detective told Dixon that “now is the time to say” whether he had any involvement in Hammer’s disappearance because “if Tim starts cutting a deal over there, this is kinda like, a bus leaving. The first one that gets on it is the only one that’s gonna get on.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 183a. Dixon responded that, if Hoffner knew anything about Hammer’s disappearance, Hoffner had not told him. Dixon insisted that he had told police everything he knew and that he had “[n]othing whatsoever” to do with Hammer’s disappearance. Id., at 186a. At approximately 3: p.m. the interrogation concluded, and the detectives brought Dixon to a correctional facility where he was booked on a forgery charge.The same afternoon, Hoffner led police to Hammer’s grave. Hoffner claimed that Dixon had told him that Hammer was buried there. After concluding their interview with Hoffner and releasing him, the police had Dixon transported back to the police station.Dixon arrived at the police station at about 7: p.m. Prior to any police questioning, Dixon stated that he had heard the police had found a body and asked whether Hoffner was in custody. The police told Dixon that Hoffner was not, at which point Dixon said, “I talked to my attorney, and I want to tell you what happened.” State v. Dixon, Ohio St. 3d , , –Ohio–, N.E.2d , . The police read Dixon his Miranda rights, obtained a signed waiver of those rights, and spoke with Dixon for about half an hour. At 8 p.m. the police, now using a tape recorder, again advised Dixon of his Miranda rights. In a detailed confession, Dixon admitted to murdering Hammer but attempted to pin the lion’s share of the blame on Hoffner.At Dixon’s trial, the Ohio trial court excluded both Dixon’s initial confession to forgery and his later confession to murder. The State took an interlocutory appeal. The State did not dispute that Dixon’s forgery confession was properly suppressed, but argued that the murder confession was admissible because Dixon had received Miranda warnings prior to that confession. The Ohio Court of Appeals agreed and allowed Dixon’s murder confession to be admitted as evidence. Dixon was convicted of murder, kidnaping, robbery, and forgery, and sentenced to death.The Ohio Supreme Court affirmed Dixon’s convictions and sentence. To analyze the admissibility of Dixon’s murder confession, the court applied Oregon v. Elstad, U.S. (). The Ohio Supreme Court found that Dixon’s confession to murder after receiving Miranda warnings was admissible because that confession and his prior, unwarned confession to forgery were both voluntary. State v. Dixon, supra, at –, N. E. 2d, at –; see Elstad, supra, at (“We hold today that a suspect who has once responded to unwarned yet uncoercive questioning is not thereby disabled from waiving his rights and confessing after he has been given the requisite Miranda warnings”).Dixon then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under U. S. C. § in the U. S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. Dixon claimed, inter alia, that the state court decisions allowing the admission of his murder confession contravened clearly established federal law. The District Court denied relief, but a divided panel of the Sixth Circuit reversed. Dixon v. Houk, F.3d ().The Sixth Circuit had authority to issue the writ of habeas corpus only if the Ohio Supreme Court’s decision “was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law,” as set forth in this Court’s holdings, or was “based on an unreasonable determination of the facts” in light of the state court record. §(d); see Harrington, U. S., at ). The Sixth Circuit believed that the Ohio Supreme Court’s decision contained three such egregious errors.First, according to the Sixth Circuit, the Miranda decision itself clearly established that police could not speak to Dixon on November 9, because on November 4 Dixon had refused to speak to police without his lawyer. That is plainly wrong. It is undisputed that Dixon was not in custody during his chance encounter with police on November 4. And this Court has “never held that a person can invoke his Miranda rights anticipatorily, in a context other than ‘custodial interrogation.’ ” McNeil v. Wisconsin, U.S. , , n. 3 (); see also Montejo v. Louisiana, U.S. op., at ) (“If the defendant is not in custody then [Miranda and its progeny] do not apply”).Second, the Sixth Circuit held that police violated the Fifth Amendment by urging Dixon to “cut a deal” before his accomplice Hoffner did so. The Sixth Circuit cited no precedent of this Court—or any court—holding that this common police tactic is unconstitutional. Cf., e.g., Elstad, supra, at (“[T]he Court has refused to find that a defendant who confesses, after being falsely told that his codefendant has turned State’s evidence, does so involuntarily”). Because no holding of this Court suggests, much less clearly establishes, that police may not urge a suspect to confess before another suspect does so, the Sixth Circuit had no authority to issue the writ on this ground.Third, the Sixth Circuit held that the Ohio Supreme Court unreasonably applied this Court’s precedent in Elstad. In that case, a suspect who had not received Miranda warnings confessed to burglary as police took him into custody. Approximately an hour later, after he had received Miranda warnings, the suspect again confessed to the same burglary. This Court held that the later, warned confession was admissible because “there is no warrant for presuming coercive effect where the suspect’s initial inculpatory statement, though technically in violation of Miranda, was voluntary. The relevant inquiry is whether, in fact, the second [warned] statement was also voluntarily made.” U. S., at (footnote omitted).As the Ohio Supreme Court’s opinion explained, the circumstances surrounding Dixon’s interrogations demonstrate that his statements were voluntary. During Dixon’s first interrogation, he received several breaks, was given water and offered food, and was not abused or threatened. He freely acknowledged that he had forged Hammer’s name, even stating that the police were “welcome” to that information, and he had no difficulty denying that he had anything to do with Hammer’s disappearance. State v. Dixon, Ohio St. 3d, at , N. E. 2d, at . Prior to his second interrogation, Dixon made an unsolicited declaration that he had spoken with his attorney and wanted to tell the police what had happened to Hammer. Then, before giving his taped confession, Dixon twice received Miranda warnings and signed a waiver-of-rights form which stated that he was acting of his own free will.The Ohio Supreme Court recognized that Dixon’s first in- terrogation involved “an intentional Miranda violation.” The court concluded, however, that “as in Elstad, the breach of the Miranda procedures here involved no actual compulsion” and thus there was no reason to suppress Dixon’s later, warned confession. Ohio St. 3d, at , N. E. 2d, at (citing Elstad, supra, at ).The Sixth Circuit disagreed, believing that Dixon’s confession was inadmissible under Elstad because it was the product of a “deliberate question-first, warn-later strategy.” F. 3d, at . In so holding, the Sixth Circuit relied heavily on this Court’s decision in Missouri v. Seibert, U.S. (). In Seibert, police employed a two-step strategy to reduce the effect of Miranda warnings: A detective exhaustively questioned Seibert until she confessed to murder and then, after a - to -minute break, gave Seibert Miranda warnings and led her to repeat her prior confession. U. S., at –, (plurality opinion). The Court held that Seibert’s second confession was inadmissible as evidence against her even though it was preceded by a Miranda warning. A plurality of the Court reasoned that “[u]pon hearing warnings only in the aftermath of interrogation and just after mak- ing a confession, a suspect would hardly think he had a genuine right to remain silent, let alone persist in so believing once the police began to lead him over the same ground again.” U. S., at ; see also id., at (detailing a “series of relevant facts that bear on whether Miranda warnings delivered midstream could be effective enough to accomplish their object”). [REDACTED] concurred in the judgment, noting he “would apply a narrower test applicable only in the infrequent case . . . in which the two-step interrogation technique was used in a calculated way to undermine the Miranda warning.” Id., at .In this case, no two-step interrogation technique of the type that concerned the Court in Seibert undermined the Miranda warnings Dixon received. In Seibert, the suspect’s first, unwarned interrogation left “little, if anything, of incriminating potential left unsaid,” making it “unnatural” not to “repeat at the second stage what had been said before.” U. S., at – (plurality opinion). But in this case Dixon steadfastly maintained during his first, unwarned interrogation that he had “[n]othing whatso- ever” to do with Hammer’s disappearance. App. to Pet. for Cert. 186a. Thus, unlike in Seibert, there is no concern here that police gave Dixon Miranda warnings and then led him to repeat an earlier murder confession, because there was no earlier confession to repeat. Indeed, Dixon contradicted his prior unwarned statements when he confessed to Hammer’s murder. Nor is there any evidence that police used Dixon’s earlier admission to forgery to induce him to waive his right to silence later: Dixon declared his desire to tell police what happened to Hammer before the second interrogation session even began. As the Ohio Supreme Court reasonably concluded, there was simply “no nexus” between Dixon’s unwarned admission to forgery and his later, warned confession to murder. Ohio St. 3d, at , N. E. 2d, at .Moreover, in Seibert the Court was concerned that the Miranda warnings did not “effectively advise the suspect that he had a real choice about giving an admissible statement” because the unwarned and warned interrogations blended into one “continuum.” U. S., at , . Given all the circumstances of this case, that is not so here. Four hours passed between Dixon’s unwarned interrogation and his receipt of Miranda rights, during which time he traveled from the police station to a separate jail and back again; claimed to have spoken to his lawyer; and learned that police were talking to his accomplice and had found Hammer’s body. Things had changed. Under Seibert, this significant break in time and dramatic change in circumstances created “a new and distinct experience,” ensuring that Dixon’s prior, unwarned interrogation did not undermine the effectiveness of the Miranda warnings he received before confessing to Hammer’s murder. U. S., at ; see also id., at ([REDACTED], J., concurring in judgment) (“For example, a substantial break in time and circumstances between the prewarning statement and the Miranda warning may suffice in most circumstances, as it allows the accused to distinguish the two contexts and appreciate that the interrogation has taken a new turn”).The admission of Dixon’s murder confession was consistent with this Court’s precedents: Dixon received Mi- randa warnings before confessing to Hammer’s murder; the effectiveness of those warnings was not impaired by the sort of “two-step interrogation technique” condemned in Seibert; and there is no evidence that any of Dixon’s statements was the product of actual coercion. That does not excuse the detectives’ decision not to give Dixon Miranda warnings before his first interrogation. But the Ohio courts recognized that failure and imposed the appropriate remedy: exclusion of Dixon’s forgery confession and the attendant statements given without the benefit of Miranda warnings. Because no precedent of this Court required Ohio to do more, the Sixth Circuit was without authority to overturn the reasoned judgment of the State’s highest court.The petition for a writ of certiorari and respondent’s motion to proceed in forma pauperis are granted. The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered."}

Decided June 5, 2017Per Curiam.The North Carolina General Assembly redrew state legislative districts in to account for population changes revealed by the census. In May , several registered North Carolina voters (here called plaintiffs) brought this action in the U. S. District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina, alleging that majority-black districts in the new plan were unconstitutional racial gerrymanders. The District Court ruled for the plaintiffs in August , holding that race was the predominant factor in the design of each challenged district, and that in none was that use of race “supported by a strong basis in evidence and narrowly tailored to comply with [the Voting Rights Act].” F. R. D. , (MDNC ).[1]* The court declined to require changes in time for the then-impending November election, but ordered the General Assembly to redraw the map before North Carolina holds any future elections for that body. See App. to Juris. Statement –.Three weeks after the November election, the District Court ordered additional relief. In addition to setting a March deadline for the General Assembly’s drawing of new districts, the court ordered that “[t]he term of any legislator elected in ” from a district later modified by that remedial plan “shall be shortened to one year” (rather than the regular two).Id., at . Those legislators would then be replaced by new ones, to be chosen in court-ordered special elections in the fall of . The legislators elected in those special elections, too, were then to “serve a one year term.”Id., at . Finally, in order to make this regime workable, the court also suspended provisions of the North Carolina Constitution requiring prospective legislators to reside within a district for one year before they may be elected to represent it. Seeid., at (citing N. C. Const., Art. II, §§6–7). To explain why these measures were warranted, the court stated: “While special elections have costs, those costs pale in comparison to the injury caused by allowing citizens to continue to be represented by legislators elected pursuant to a racial gerrymander.” App. to Juris. Statement .North Carolina appealed the District Court’s remedial order to this Court, and we granted a stay pending appeal. See U. S. The State now contends that “the remedial order should be vacated for the simple reason that the district court failed to meaningfully weigh any equitable considerations.” Juris. Statement . We share that assessment and now vacate the order.Relief in redistricting cases is “‘fashioned in the light of well-known principles of equity.’”Reynoldsv.Sims, U. S. , () . A district court therefore must undertake an “equitable weighing process” to select a fitting remedy for the legal violations it has identified,NAACPv.Hampton County Election Comm’n, U. S. , , n. () , taking account of “‘what is necessary, what is fair, and what is workable,’”New Yorkv.Cathedral Academy, U. S. , () . And in the context of deciding whether to truncate existing legislators’ terms and order a special election, there is much for a court to weigh. Although this Court has never addressed whether or when a special election may be a proper remedy for a racial gerrymander, obvious considerations include the severity and nature of the particular constitutional violation, the extent of the likely disruption to the ordinary processes of governance if early elections are imposed, and the need to act with proper judicial restraint when intruding on state sovereignty. We do not suggest anything about the relative weight of these factors (or others), but they are among the matters a court would generally be expected to consider in its “balancing of the individual and collective interests” at stake.Swannv.Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Ed., U. S. 1, () .Rather than undertaking such an analysis in this case, the District Court addressed the balance of equities in only the most cursory fashion. As noted above, the court simply announced that “[w]hile special elections have costs,” those unspecified costs “pale in comparison” to the prospect that citizens will be “represented by legislators elected pursuant to a racial gerrymander.” App. to Juris. Statement . That minimal reasoning would appear to justify a special election ineveryracial-gerrymandering case—a result clearly at odds with our demand for careful case-specific analysis. For that reason, we cannot have confidence that the court adequately grappled with the interests on both sides of the remedial question before us. And because the District Court’s discretion “was barely exercised here,” its order provides no meaningful basis for even deferential review.Winterv.Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., U. S. 7, () .For these reasons, we vacate the District Court’s remedial order and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.* By separate order, we have summarily affirmed the District Court’s ruling on the merits of the plaintiffs’ racial-gerrymandering claims.

Decided March 6, 2017Per Curiam.A Nevada jury convicted petitioner Michael Damon Rippo of first-degree murder and other offenses and sentenced him to death. During his trial, Rippo received information that the judge was the target of a federal bribery probe, and he surmised that the Clark County District Attorney’s Office—which was prosecuting him—was playing a role in that investigation. Rippo moved for the judge’s disqualification under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, contending that a judge could not impartially adjudicate a case in which one of the parties was criminally investigating him. But the trial judge declined to recuse himself, and (after that judge’s indictment on federal charges) a different judge later denied Rippo’s motion for a new trial. The Nevada Supreme Court affirmed on direct appeal, reasoning in part that Rippo had not introduced evidence that state authorities were involved in the federal investigation.Rippov.State, Nev. , –, P. 2d , – () (per curiam).In a later application for state postconviction relief, Rippo advanced his bias claim once more, this time pointing to documents from the judge’s criminal trial indicating that the district attorney’s office had participated in the investigation of the trial judge. See,e.g.,App. to Pet. for Cert. –, . The state postconviction court denied relief, and the Nevada Supreme Court affirmed.Rippov.State, Nev. 3d , – (). It likened Rippo’s claim to the “camouflaging bias” theory that this Court discussed inBracyv.Gramley, U. S. () . TheBracypetitioner argued that a judge who accepts bribes to rule in favor of some defendants would seek to disguise that favorable treatment by rulingagainstdefendants who did not bribe him.Id.,at . We explained that despite the “speculative” nature of that theory, the petitioner was entitled to discovery because he had also alleged specific facts suggesting that the judge may have colluded with defense counsel to rush the petitioner’s case to trial. Seeid.,at –. The Nevada Supreme Court reasoned that, in contrast, Rippo was not entitled to discovery or an evidentiary hearing because his allegations “d[id] not support the assertion that the trial judge was actually biased in this case.” Nev. 3d, at .[1]We vacate the Nevada Supreme Court’s judgment because it applied the wrong legal standard. Under our precedents, the Due Process Clause may sometimes demand recusal even when a judge “ ‘ha[s] no actual bias.’ ”Aetna Life Ins. Co.v.Lavoie, U. S. , () . Recusal is required when, objectively speaking, “the probability of actual bias on the part of the judge or decisionmaker is too high to be constitutionally tolerable.”Withrowv.Larkin, U. S. , () ; seeWilliamsv.Pennsylvania, U. S., at 6) (“The Court asks not whether a judge harbors an actual, subjective bias, but instead whether, as an objective matter, the average judge in his position is likely to be neutral, or whether there is an unconstitutional potential for bias” (internal quotation marks omitted)). Our decision inBracyis not to the contrary: Although we explained that the petitioner therehadpointed to facts suggesting actual, subjective bias, we did not hold that a litigant must show as a matter of course that a judge was “actually biased in [the litigant’s] case,” Nev. 3d, at —much less that he must do so when, as here, he does not allege a theory of “camouflaging bias.” The Nevada Supreme Court did not ask the question our precedents require: whether, considering all the circumstances alleged, the risk of bias was too high to be constitutionally tolerable. As a result, we grant the petition for writ of certiorari and the motion for leave to proceedin forma pauperis, and we vacate the judgment below and remand the case for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.Notes1The court further relied on its bias holding to determine that Rippo had not established cause and prejudice to overcome various state procedural bars. Nev. 3d, at .

Decided June 1, 2015Per Curiam.Christopher Barkes, “a troubled man with a long history of mental health and substance abuse problems,” was arrested on November , , for violating his probation.Barkesv.First Correctional Medical, Inc., F. 3d , – ( ). Barkes was taken to the Howard R. Young Correctional Institution in Wilmington, Delaware. As part of Barkes’s intake, a nurse who worked for the contractor providing healthcare at the Institution conducted a medical evaluation.Id., at .The evaluation included a mental health screening designed in part to assess whether an inmate was suicidal. The nurse employed a suicide screening form based on a model form developed by the National Commission on Correctional Health Care (NCCHC) in . The form listed suicide risk factors. If the inmate’s responses and nurse’s observations indicated that at least eight were present, or if certain serious risk factors were present, the nurse would notify a physician and initiate suicide prevention measures.Id., at , .Barkes disclosed that he had a history of psychiatric treatment and was on medication. He also disclosed that he had attempted suicide in , though not—as far as the record indicates—that he had also done so on three other occasions. And he indicated that he was not cur-rently thinking about killing himself. Because only two risk factors were apparent, the nurse gave Barkes a “routine” referral to mental health services and did not initiate any special suicide prevention measures.Id., at .Barkes was placed in a cell by himself. Despite what he had told the nurse, that evening he called his wife and told her that he “can’t live this way anymore” and was going to kill himself. Barkes’s wife did not inform anyone at the Institution of this call. The next morning, correctional officers observed Barkes awake and behaving normally at :, :, and : a.m. At : a.m., however, an officer arrived to deliver lunch and discovered that Barkes had hanged himself with a sheet.Id., at –.Barkes’s wife and children, respondents here, brought suit under Rev. Stat. §, U. S. C. §, against various entities and individuals connected with the Institution, who they claimed had violated Barkes’s civil rights in failing to prevent his suicide. At issue here is a claim against petitioners Stanley Taylor, Commissioner of the Delaware Department of Correction (DOC), and Raphael Williams, the Institution’s warden. Although it is undisputed that neither petitioner had personally interacted with Barkes or knew of his condition before his death, respondents alleged that Taylor and Williams had violated Barkes’s constitutional right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment.Barkesv.First Correctional Medical, Inc., WL , *7 (D Del., Feb. , ). They did so, according to respondents, by failing to supervise and monitor the private contractor that provided the medical treatment—including the intake screening—at the Institution. Petitioners moved for summary judgment on the ground that they were entitled to qualified immu-nity, but the District Court denied the motion.Barkesv.First Correctional Medical, Inc., WL , *8–* (D Del., July , ).A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed. The majority first determined that respondents had alleged a cognizable theory of supervisory liability (a decision upon which we express no view). F. 3d, at –. The majority then turned to the two-step qualified immunity inquiry, asking “first, whether the plaintiff suffered a deprivation of a constitutional or stat-utory right; and second, if so, whether that right was ‘clearly established’ at the time of the alleged misconduct.”Id., at .Taking these questions in reverse order, the Third Circuit held that it was clearly established at the time of Barkes’s death that an incarcerated individual had an Eighth Amendment “right to the proper implementation of adequate suicide prevention protocols.”Id., at . The panel majority then concluded there were material factual disputes about whether petitioners had violated this right by failing to adequately supervise the contractor providing medical services at the prison. There was evidence, the majority noted, that the medical contractor’s suicide screening process did not comply with NCCHC’s latest standards, as required by the contract. Those standards allegedly called for a revised screening form and for screening by a qualified mental health professional, not a nurse. There was also evidence that the contractor did not have access to Barkes’s probation records (which would have shed light on his mental health history), and that the contractor had been short-staffing to increase profits.Id., at –.Judge Hardiman dissented. As relevant here, he concluded that petitioners were entitled to qualified immu-nity because the right on which the majority relied was “a departure from Eighth Amendment case law that had never been established before today.”Id., at .Taylor and Williams petitioned for certiorari. We grant the petition and reverse on the ground that there was no violation of clearly established law.“Qualified immunity shields government officials from civil damages liability unless the official violated a statutory or constitutional right that was clearly established at the time of the challenged conduct.”Reichlev.Howards, U. S., at 5). “To be clearly established, a right must be sufficiently clear that every reasonable official would have understood that what he is doing violates that right.”Ibid.(brackets and internal quotation marks omitted). “When properly applied, [qualified immunity] protects all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.”Ashcroftv.al-Kidd, U. S., at ) (internal quotation marks omitted). “We do not require a case directly on point, but existing precedent must have placed the statutory or constitutional question beyond debate.”Id., at 9).The Third Circuit concluded that the right at issue was best defined as “an incarcerated person’s right to the proper implementation of adequate suicide prevention protocols.” F. 3d, at . This purported right, however, was not clearly established in November in a way that placed beyond debate the unconstitutionality of the Institution’s procedures, as implemented by the medical contractor.No decision of this Court establishes a right to theproper implementation of adequate suicide prevention pro-tocols. No decision of this Court even discusses suicide screening or prevention protocols. And “to the extent that a ‘robust consensus of cases of persuasive authority’ ” in the Courts of Appeals “could itself clearly establish the federal right respondent alleges,”City and County of San Franciscov.Sheehan, U. S., at ), the weight of that authority at the time of Barkes’s death suggested that such a right didnotexist. See,e.g.,Comstockv.McCrary, F. 3d , ( ) (“the right to medical care for serious medical needs does not encompass the right to be screened correctly for suicidal tendencies” (internal quotation marks omitted));Tittlev.Jefferson Cty. Comm’n, F. 3d , ( ) (alleged “weaknesses in the [suicide] screening process, the training of deputies[,] and the supervision of prisoners” did not “amount to a showing of deliberate indifference toward the rights of prisoners”);Burnsv.Galveston, F. 2d , ( ) (rejecting the proposition that “the right of detainees to adequate medical care includes an absolute right to psychological screening”);Belcherv.Oliver, F. 2d , – ( ) (“The general right of pretrial detainees to receive basic medical care does not place upon jail officials the responsibility to screen every detainee for suicidal tendencies.”).The Third Circuit nonetheless found this right clearly established by two of its own decisions, both stemming from the same case. Assuming for the sake of argument that a right can be “clearly established” by circuit precedent despite disagreement in the courts of appeals, neither of the Third Circuit decisions relied upon clearly established the right at issue. The first,Colburn I, said that if officials “know or should know of the particular vulner-ability to suicide of an inmate,” they have an obligation “not to act with reckless indifference to that vulnerability.”Colburnv.Upper Darby Twp., F. 2d , (). The decision did not say, however, that detention facilities must implement procedures to identify such vulnerable inmates, let alone specify what procedures would suffice. And the Third Circuit later acknowledged thatColburn I’s use of the phrase “or should know”—which might seem to nod toward a screening requirement of some kind—was erroneous in light ofFarmerv.Brennan, U. S. () , which held that Eighth Amendment liability requires actual awareness of risk. SeeSerafinv.Johnstown, Fed. Appx. , ( ).Nor wouldColburn IIhave put petitioners on notice of any possible constitutional violation.Colburn IIreiter-ated that officials who know of an inmate’s particular vul-nerability to suicide must not be recklessly indifferent to that vulnerability.Colburnv.Upper Darby Twp., F. 2d , (). But it did not identify any minimum screening procedures or prevention protocols that facilities must use. In fact,Colburn IIrevealed that the booking process of the jail at issue “include[d] no formal physical or mental health screening,”ibid., and yet the Third Circuit ruled for the defendants on all claims, seeid., at –.In short, even if the Institution’s suicide screening and prevention measures contained the shortcomings that respondents allege, no precedent on the books in November would have made clear to petitioners that they were overseeing a system that violated the Constitution. Because, at the very least, petitioners were not contravening clearly established law, they are entitled to qualified immunity. The judgment of the Third Circuit is reversed.It is so ordered."}
{"file_name": "per curiam_2014_833_572.json", "author": "per curiam", "year": 2014, "text": "–. Decided May , 2014Per Curiam.The trial of Esteban Martinez was set to begin on May , . His counsel was ready; the State was not. When the court swore in the jury and invited the State to present its first witness, the State declined to present any evidence. So Martinez moved for a directed not-guilty verdict, and the court granted it. The State appealed, arguing that the trial court should have granted its motion for a continuance. The question is whether the Double Jeopardy Clause bars the State’s attempt to appeal in the hope of subjecting Martinez to a new trial.The Illinois Supreme Court manifestly erred in allowing the State’s appeal, on the theory that jeopardy never attached because Martinez “was never at risk of conviction.” IL , ¶, N.E.2d , . Our cases have repeatedly stated the bright-line rule that “jeopardy attaches when the jury is empaneled and sworn.” Crist v. Bretz, U.S. , () ; see infra, at 6. There is simply no doubt that Martinez was subjected to jeopardy. And because the trial court found the State’s evidence insufficient to sustain a conviction, there is equally no doubt that Martinez may not be retried.We therefore grant Martinez’s petition for certiorari and reverse the judgment of the Illinois Supreme Court.IAThe State of Illinois indicted Martinez in August on charges of aggravated battery and mob action against Avery Binion and Demarco Scott. But Martinez’s trial date did not arrive for nearly four years. [1]The story picks up for present purposes on July , , when the State moved to continue an August 3 trial date because it had not located the complaining witnesses, Binion and Scott. The State subpoenaed both men four days later, and the court rescheduled Martinez’s trial to September . But the State sought another continuance, shortly before that date, because it still had not found Binion and Scott. The court rescheduled the trial to November 9, and the State reissued subpoenas. But November 9 came and went (the court continued the case when Martinez showed up late) and the trial was eventually delayed to the following March . In early February, the State yet again subpoenaed Binion and Scott. When March arrived, the trial court granted the State an-other continuance. It reset the trial date for May and ordered Binion and Scott to appear in court on May . And the State once more issued subpoenas. [2]On the morning of May , however, Binion and Scott were again nowhere to be found. At 8:, when the trial was set to begin, the State asked for a brief continuance. The court offered to delay swearing the jurors until a complete jury had been empaneled and told the State that it could at that point either have the jury sworn or move to dismiss its case. When Binion and Scott still had not shown up after the jury was chosen, the court offered to call the other cases on its docket so as to delay swearing the jury a bit longer. But when all these delays had run out, Binion and Scott were still nowhere in sight. The State filed a written motion for a continuance, arguing that it was “unable to proceed” without Binion and Scott. Tr. 7. The court denied that motion:“The case before the Court began on July 7, . In two months we will then be embarking upon half a decade of pending a Class 3 felony. Avery Binion, Jr., and Demarco [Scott] are well known in Elgin, both are convicted felons. One would believe that the Elgin Police Department would know their whereabouts. They were ordered to be in court today. The Court will issue body writs for both of these gentlemen.“In addition, the State’s list of witnesses indi- cates twelve witnesses. Excluding Mr. Scott and Mr. Binion, that’s ten witnesses. The Court would anticipate it would take every bit of today and most of tomorrow to get through ten witnesses. By then the People may have had a chance to execute the arrest warrant body writs for these two gentlemen.“The Court will deny the motion for continuance. I will swear the jury in in , minutes. Perhaps you might want to send the police out to find these two gentlemen.” Id., at 8–9.After a brief recess, the court offered to delay the start of the trial for several more hours if the continuance would “be of any help” to the State. Id., at 9. But when the State made clear that Binion and Scott’s “whereabouts” remained “unknown,” the court concluded that the delay “would be a further waste of time.” Id., at . The following colloquy ensued:“THE COURT: . . . . It’s a quarter to eleven and [Binion and Scott] have not appeared on their own will, so I’m going to bring the jury in now then to swear them.“[The Prosecutor]: Okay. Your Honor, may I approach briefly?“THE COURT: Yes.“[The Prosecutor]: Your Honor, just so your Honor is aware, I know that it’s the process to bring them in and swear them in; however, the State will not be participating in the trial. I wanted to let you know that.“THE COURT: Very well. We’ll see how that works.” Id., at –.The jury was then sworn. After instructing the jury, the court directed the State to proceed with its opening statement. The prosecutor demurred: “Your Honor, respect- fully, the State is not participating in this case.” Id., at . After the defense waived its opening statement, the court directed the State to call its first witness. Again, the prosecutor demurred: “Respectfully, your Honor, the State is not participating in this matter.” Ibid. The defense then moved for a judgment of acquittal:“[Defense Counsel]: Judge, the jury has been sworn. The State has not presented any evidence. I believe they’ve indicated their intention not to present any evidence or witnesses.“Based on that, Judge, I would ask the Court to enter directed findings of not guilty to both counts, ag- gravated battery and mob action.“THE COURT: Do the People wish to reply?“[The Prosecutor]: No, your Honor. Respectfully, the State is not participating.“THE COURT: The Court will grant the motion for a directed finding and dismiss the charges.” Id., at .BThe State appealed, arguing that the trial court should have granted a continuance. Martinez responded that the State’s appeal was improper because he had been acquitted. The Illinois Appellate Court sided with the State, holding that jeopardy had never attached and that the trial court had erred in failing to grant a continuance. IL App (2d) , ¶¶, –, N.E.2d , , –.The Illinois Supreme Court granted review on the jeopardy issue and affirmed. IL , N.E.2d . It began by recognizing that “[g]enerally, in cases of a jury trial, jeopardy attaches when a jury is empaneled and sworn, as that is the point when the defendant is ‘ “put to trial before the trier of the facts.” ’ ” Id., ¶, N. E. 2d, at (quoting Serfass v. United States, U.S. , () ). But it reasoned that under this Court’s precedents, “ ‘ “rigid, mechanical” rules’ ” should not govern the inquiry into whether jeopardy has attached. IL , ¶, N. E. 2d, at (quoting Serfass, supra, at ). Rather, it opined, the relevant question is whether a defendant “was ‘ “subjected to the hazards of trial and possible conviction.” ’ ” IL , ¶, N. E. 2d, at (quoting Serfass, supra, at ).Here, the court concluded, Martinez “was never at risk of conviction”—and jeopardy therefore did not attach—because “[t]he State indicated it would not participate prior to the jury being sworn.” IL , ¶, N. E. 2d, at . And because Martinez “was not placed in jeopardy,” the court held, the trial “court’s entry of directed verdicts of not guilty did not constitute true acquittals.” Id., ¶, N. E. 2d, at . Indeed, the court remarked, the trial court “repeatedly referred to its action as a ‘dismissal’ rather than an acquittal.” Ibid.[REDACTED] dissented, writing that the majority’s conclusion “that impaneling and swearing the jury had no legal significance” ran “contrary to well-established principles regarding double jeopardy.” Id., ¶, N. E. 2d, at . Moreover, she argued, its assertion that Martinez was not in danger of conviction was “belied by the actions of the court and the prosecutor.” Id., ¶, N. E. 2d, at . She explained that under the majority’s holding, the State could “unilaterally render a trial a ‘sham’ simply by refusing to call witnesses after a jury has been selected.” Id., ¶, N. E. 2d, at .IIThis case presents two issues. First, did jeopardy attach to Martinez? Second, if so, did the proceeding end in such a manner that the Double Jeopardy Clause bars his retrial? Our precedents clearly dictate an affirmative answer to each question.AThere are few if any rules of criminal procedure clearer than the rule that “jeopardy attaches when the jury is empaneled and sworn.” Crist, U. S., at ; see also United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co., U.S. , () ; Serfass, supra, at ; 6 W. LaFave, J. Israel, N. King, & O. Kerr, Criminal Procedure §.1(d) (3d ed. ).Our clearest exposition of this rule came in Crist, which addressed the constitutionality of a Montana statute providing that jeopardy did not attach until the swearing of the first witness. As Crist explains, “the precise point at which jeopardy [attaches] in a jury trial might have been open to argument before this Court’s decision in Downum v. United States, U.S. [()],” in which “the Court held that the Double Jeopardy Clause prevented a second prosecution of a defendant whose first trial had ended just after the jury had been sworn and before any testimony had been taken.” U. S., at . But Downum put any such argument to rest: Its holding “necessarily pinpointed the stage in a jury trial when jeopardy attaches, and [it] has since been understood as explicit authority for the proposition that jeopardy attaches when the jury is empaneled and sworn.” Crist, supra, at .The Illinois Supreme Court misread our precedents in suggesting that the swearing of the jury is anything other than a bright line at which jeopardy attaches. It relied on Serfass, understanding that case to mean “that in assessing whether and when jeopardy attaches, ‘ “rigid, mechanical” rules’ should not be applied.” IL , ¶, N. E. 2d, at . Under Serfass, the court reasoned, the relevant question is whether a defendant was as a functional matter “ ‘ “subjected to the hazards of trial and possible conviction.” ’ ” IL , ¶, N. E. 2d, at .But Serfass does not apply a functional approach to the determination of when jeopardy has attached. As to that question, it states the same bright-line rule as every other case: Jeopardy attaches when “a defendant is ‘put to trial,’ ” and in a jury trial, that is “when a jury is empaneled and sworn.” U. S., at . Indeed, Serfass explicitly rejects a functional approach to the question whether jeopardy has attached. See id., at (refuting the defendant’s argument that “ ‘constructiv[e] jeopardy had attached’ ” upon the pretrial grant of a motion to dismiss the indictment, which the defendant characterized as “the ‘functional equivalent of an acquittal on the merits’ ”). The Serfass Court acknowledged “that we have disparaged ‘rigid, mechanical’ rules in the interpretation of the Double Jeopardy Clause.” Ibid. But it was referring to the case of Illinois v. Somerville, U.S. () , in which we declined to apply “rigid, mechanical” reasoning in answering a very different question: not whether jeopardy had attached, but whether the manner in which it terminated (by mistrial) barred the defendant’s retrial. Id., at . By contrast, Serfass explains, the rule that jeopardy attaches at the start of a trial is “by no means a mere technicality, nor is it a ‘rigid, mechanical’ rule.” U. S., at . And contrary to the Illinois Supreme Court’s interpretation, Serfass creates not the slightest doubt about when a “trial” begins.The Illinois Supreme Court’s error was consequential, for it introduced confusion into what we have consistently treated as a bright-line rule: A jury trial begins, and jeopardy attaches, when the jury is sworn. We have never suggested the exception perceived by the Illinois Supreme Court—that jeopardy may not have attached where, under the circumstances of a particular case, the defendant was not genuinely at risk of conviction. [3] Martinez was subjected to jeopardy because the jury in his case was sworn.B“ ‘[T]he conclusion that jeopardy has attached,’ ” how- ever, “ ‘begins, rather than ends, the inquiry as to whether the Double Jeopardy Clause bars retrial.’ ” Id., at . The remaining question is whether the jeopardy ended in such a manner that the defendant may not be retried. See 6 LaFave §.1(g) (surveying circumstances in which retrial is and is not allowed). Here, there is no doubt that Martinez’s jeopardy ended in a manner that bars his retrial: The trial court acquitted him of the charged offenses. “Perhaps the most fundamental rule in the history of double jeopardy jurisprudence has been that ‘[a] verdict of acquittal . . . could not be reviewed . . . without putting [a defendant] twice in jeopardy, and thereby violating the Constitution.’ ” Martin Linen, supra, at .“[O]ur cases have defined an acquittal to encompass any ruling that the prosecution’s proof is insufficient to establish criminal liability for an offense.” Evans v. Michigan, U. S., at 4–5). And the trial court clearly made such a ruling here. After the State declined to present evidence against Martinez, his counsel moved for “directed findings of not guilty to both counts,” and the court “grant[ed] the motion for a directed finding.” Tr. . That is a textbook acquittal: a finding that the State’s evidence cannot support a conviction.The Illinois Supreme Court thought otherwise. It first opined that “[b]ecause [Martinez] was not placed in jeopardy, the [trial] court’s entry of directed verdicts of not guilty did not constitute true acquittals.” IL , ¶, N. E. 2d, at . But the premise of that argument is incorrect: Martinez was in jeopardy, for the reasons given above. The court went on to “note that, in directing findings of not guilty,” the trial court “referred to its action as a ‘dismissal’ rather than an acquittal.” Ibid. Under our precedents, however, that is immaterial: “[W]e have emphasized that what constitutes an ‘acquittal’ is not to be controlled by the form of the judge’s action”; it turns on “whether the ruling of the judge, whatever its label, actually represents a resolution . . . of some or all of the factual elements of the offense charged.” Martin Linen, U. S., at ) (“Our decision turns not on the form of the trial court’s action, but rather whether it ‘serve[s]’ substantive ‘purposes’ or procedural ones”); United States v. Scott, U.S. , () (“We have previously noted that ‘the trial judge’s characterization of his own action cannot control the classification of the action’ ”).Here, as in Evans and Martin Linen, the trial court’s action was an acquittal because the court “acted on its view that the prosecution had failed to prove its case., at ); see Martin Linen, supra, at (“[T]he District Court in this case evaluated the Government’s evidence and determined that it was legally insufficient to sustain a conviction”). And because Martinez was acquitted, the State cannot retry him. [4]IIIThe functional rule adopted by the Illinois Supreme Court is not necessary to avoid unfairness to prosecutors or to the public. On the day of trial, the court was acutely aware of the significance of swearing a jury. It repeatedly delayed that act to give the State additional time to find its witnesses. It had previously granted the State a number of continuances for the same purpose. See supra, at 2. And, critically, the court told the State on the day of trial that it could “move to dismiss [its] case” before the jury was sworn. Tr. 3. Had the State accepted that invitation, the Double Jeopardy Clause would not have barred it from recharging Martinez. Instead, the State participated in the selection of jurors and did not ask for dismissal before the jury was sworn. When the State declined to dismiss its case, it “ ‘took a chance[,] . . . enter[ing] upon the trial of the case without sufficient evidence to convict.’ ” Downum v. United States, U.S. , () . Here, the State knew, or should have known, that an acquittal forever bars the retrial of the defendant when it occurs after jeopardy has attached. The Illinois Supreme Court’s holding is understandable, given the significant consequence of the State’s mistake, but it runs directly counter to our precedents and to the protection conferred by the Double Jeopardy Clause.* * *The motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis and the petition for a writ of certiorari are granted. The judgment of the Supreme Court of Illinois is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.Notes1Much of that delay was due to Martinez and his counsel. See IL , ¶4, n. 1, N.E.2d , , n. 1 (summarizing the lengthy procedural history).2These facts are set forth in the opinion of the Illinois Appellate Court. IL App (2d) , ¶¶5–7, N.E.2d , –.3Some commentators have suggested that there may be limited exceptions to this rule—e.g., where the trial court lacks jurisdiction or where a defendant obtains an acquittal by fraud or corruption. See 6 W. LaFave, J. Israel, N. King, & O. Kerr, Criminal Procedure §.1(d) (3d ed. ). The scope of any such exceptions is not presented here. Nor need we reach a situation where the prosecutor had no opportunity to dismiss the charges to avoid the consequences of empaneling the jury. Cf. People v. Deems, Ill. 2d , –, N.E.2d 8, – ().4Indeed, even if the trial court had chosen to dismiss the case or declare a mistrial rather than granting Martinez’s motion for a directed verdict, the Double Jeopardy Clause probably would still bar his retrial. We confronted precisely this scenario in Downum v. United States, U.S. () , holding that once jeopardy has attached, the absence of witnesses generally does not constitute the kind of “ ‘extraordinary and striking circumstanc[e]’ ” in which a trial court may exercise “discretion to discharge the jury before it has reached a verdict.” Id., at ; see also Arizona v. Washington, U.S. , , n. () ."}

Decided March , 2015Per Curiam.Federal courts may grant habeas corpus relief if the underlying state-court decision was \"contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by\" this Court. U. S. C. §(d)(1). Here, the Sixth Circuit held that respondent Cory Donald's attorney providedper seineffective assistance of counsel underUnited Statesv.Cronic, U. S. () , when he was briefly absent during testimony concerning other defendants. Because no decision from this Court clearly establishes that Donald is entitled to relief underCronic, we reverse.IAfter a day of drinking and smoking marijuana, Cory Donald and four others—Seante Liggins, Rashad Moore, Dewayne Saine, and Fawzi Zaya—decided to rob a drug dealer named Mohammed Makki. Donald, Moore, and Liggins drove to Makki's home in Dearborn, Michigan, wearing black skull caps and coats. Moore and Donald entered the house, while Liggins waited in the car.Michael McGinnis, one of Makki's drug runners, was in the house at the time. When Donald and Moore came through the door, McGinnis raised his hands and dropped face-down to the floor. He heard a scuffle in the kitchen and two gunshots as someone said, \" '[L]et it go.' \"Donaldv.Rapelje, Fed. Appx. , ( ). After that, McGinnnis felt a gun on the back of his head while someone rifled through his pockets saying, \" '[W]hat you got, what you got?' \"Donaldv.Rapelje, WL , *3 (ED Mich., Dec. 5, ). He also heard one of the two men whisper to the other, \" 'I got shot, I got shot.' \" Fed. Appx., at . After Moore and Donald left, McGinnis found Makki slumped against the refrigerator dying.About seven minutes after they entered the house, Moore and Donald returned, guns in hand, to Liggins' car. Donald told the others that he had stolen $ and that Moore had accidentally shot him during the crime. That night, Donald checked into a hospital for a gunshot wound to his foot. Police arrested him about three weeks later.The State charged Donald with one count of first-degree felony murder and two counts of armed robbery. Liggins and Zaya pleaded guilty, and Donald was tried with Moore and Saine. His defense theory was that he was present at the scene of the crime but he did not participate. At trial, the government sought to admit a chart chronicling phone calls from the day of the crime among Moore, Saine, and Zaya. Moore and Saine's attorneys objected, but Donald's attorney declined, saying: \" 'I don't have a dog in this race. It does not affect me at all.' \"Id., at . The court admitted the exhibit and took a short recess.When the trial resumed, Donald's counsel was not in the courtroom. At first, the judge indicated that he would wait for the attorney. But he then decided to proceed because Donald's counsel had already indicated that the exhibit and testimony did not apply to his client. About minutes later, the lawyer returned. The judge informed him that \" 'up until that point we only were discussing the telephone chart,' \" to which the attorney replied, \" '[ Y ]es, your Honor, and as I had indicated on the record, I had no dog in the race and no interest in that.' \"Ibid.The jury found Donald guilty on all three counts. He was sentenced to life imprisonment for the felony-murder count and to concurrent prison terms of ⁄2 to years for each of the armed robbery counts. On appeal, Donald argued that he was entitled to a new trial because his attorney's absence during the phone call testimony denied him his Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel. The Michigan Court of Appeals rejected his claim, and the Michigan Supreme Court denied review.The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan granted federal habeas relief, and the Sixth Circuit affirmed. The Sixth Circuit held that the Michigan Court of Appeals' decision was both contrary to and involved an unreasonable application of this Court's decision inCronic. In the normal course, defendants claiming ineffective assistance of counsel must satisfy the familiar framework ofStricklandv.Washington, U. S. , () , which requires a showing that \"counsel's performance was deficient\" and \"that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.\" And when reviewing an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim, \"a court must indulge a strong presumption that counsel's conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\"Id.,at .InCronic, however, we held that courts may presume that a defendant has suffered unconstitutional prejudice if he \"is denied counsel at a critical stage of his trial.\" U. S., at . And inBellv.Cone, U. S. , () , we characterized a \"critical stage\" as one that \"held significant consequences for the accused.\" According to the Sixth Circuit, these statements should have compelled the Michigan court to hold that the phone call testimony was a \"critical stage\" and that counsel's absence consti-tutedper seineffective assistance. Without identifying any decision from this Court directly in point, the Sixth Circuit concluded that the relevant testimony in this case was \"similar to\" our cases applyingCronic. Fed. Appx., at .IIAUnder the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of (AEDPA), 110Stat. , a federal court may grant habeas relief only when a state court's decision on the merits was \"contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by\" decisions from this Court, or was \"based on an unreasonable determination of the facts.\" U. S. C. §(d). Donald does not argue that the state-court decision in his case was factually erroneous. Instead, he argues that the decision was both contrary to and involved an unreasonable application of this Court's ineffective-assistance-of-counsel cases.AEDPA's standard is intentionally \" ' \"difficult to meet.\" ' \"Whitev.Woodall, U. S., at 3) (quotingMetrishv.Lancaster, U. S., at 5)). We have explained that \" 'clearly established Federal law' for purposes of §(d)(1) includes only the holdings, as opposed to the dicta, of this Court's decisions.\"White, U. S., at 3) (some internal quotation marks omitted). \"And an 'unreasonable application of' those holdings must be objectively unreasonable, not merely wrong; even clear error will not suffice.\"Id., at 3–4) (same). To satisfy this high bar, a habeas petitioner is required to \"show that the state court's ruling on the claim being presented in federal court was so lacking in justification that there was an error well understood and comprehended in existing law beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.\"Harringtonv.Richter, U. S. , () .Adherence to these principles serves important interests of federalism and comity. AEDPA's requirements reflect a \"presumption that state courts know and follow the law.\"Woodfordv.Visciotti, U. S. , () (per curiam). When reviewing state criminal convictions on collateral review, federal judges are required to afford state courts due respect by overturning their decisions only when there could be no reasonable dispute that they were wrong. Federal habeas review thus exists as \"a guard against extreme malfunctions in the state criminal justice systems, not a substitute for ordinary error correction through appeal.\"Harrington,supra, at – (internal quotation marks omitted). This is especially true for claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, where AEDPA review must be \" ' \"doubly deferential\" ' \" in order to afford \"both the state court and the defense attorney the benefit of the doubt.\"Burtv.Titlow, U. S., at 1) (quotingCullenv.Pinholster, U. S., at )).BThe Sixth Circuit should not have affirmed theCronic-based grant of habeas relief in this case. The Michigan Court of Appeals' decision was not contrary to any clearly established holding of this Court. We have never addressed whether the rule announced inCronicapplies to testimony regarding codefendants' actions. InCronicitself, we rejected the defendant's claim that his counsel's lack of experience and short time for preparation warranted a presumption of prejudice, not a claim based on coun-sel's absence. See U. S., at –. When announcing the rule inCronic, we cited earlier cases finding prejudice where \"counsel was either totally absent, or prevented from assisting the accused during a critical stage of the proceeding.\"Id., at , n. . But none of those cases dealt with circumstances like those present here. AndBelldid not involve the absence of counsel; instead, we declined to presume prejudice where a capital defendant's counsel \"failed to 'mount some case for life' after the prosecution introduced evidence in the sentencing hearing and gave a closing statement.\" U. S., at .Because none of our cases confront \"the specific question presented by this case,\" the state court's decision could not be \"contrary to\" any holding from this Court.Lopezv.Smith, U. S., at 5). The most that the Sixth Circuit could muster was that \"[t]he testimony of a government witness is similar to the trial events that th[is] Court has deemed to be critical stages.\" Fed. Appx., at . But that conclusion is doubly wrong. First, if the circumstances of a case are only \"similar to\" our precedents, then the state court's decision is not \"contrary to\" the holdings in those cases. See,e.g., Careyv.Musladin, U. S. –, and n. 2 (). Second, the Sixth Circuit framed the issue at too high a level of generality. See,e.g., at 5). The relevant testimony was not merely \"testimony of a government witness\"; it was prosecution testimonyabout other defendants. To be sure, the Sixth Circuit considered the testimony relevant to Donald because he was being prosecuted on an aiding-and-abetting theory for felony murder. But Donald's position was that he had nothing to do with the planning among his codefendants. And none of our holdings address counsel's absence during testimony that is irrelevant within the defendant's own theory of the case.Nor was the state court's decision an unreasonable application of our cases. The Sixth Circuit stated \"that a critical stage of trial is a 'step of a criminal proceeding . . . that h[olds] significant consequences for the accused.' \" Fed. Appx., at (quotingBell,supra, at ). And it held that the Michigan Court of Appeals' decision was \"objectively unreasonable\" because the phone call evidence might have indirectly inculpated Donald in the eyes of the jury. But that holding is not correct. Just last Term we warned the Sixth Circuit that \"where the ' \"precise contours\" ' of [a] right remain ' \"unclear,\" ' state courts enjoy 'broad discretion' in their adjudication of a prisoner's claims.\"White, U. S., at 9) (quotingLockyerv.Andrade, U. S. , () , in turn quotingHarmelinv.Michigan, U. S. , () ([REDACTED], J., concurring in part and in judgment)). Within the contours ofCronic, a fairminded jurist could conclude that a presumption of prejudice is not warranted by counsel's short absence during testimony about other defendants where that testimony was irrelevant to the defendant's theory of the case.Cronicapplies in \"circumstances that are so likely to prejudice the accused that the cost of litigating their effect in a particular case is unjustified.\" U. S., at . The Michigan Court of Appeals' refusal to apply it to these circumstances was not the \"extreme malfunction\" required for federal habeas relief.Harrington, U. S., at .IIIBecause we consider this case only in the narrow context of federal habeas review, we \"expres[s] no view on the merits of the underlying Sixth Amendment principle.\"Marshallv.Rodgers, U. S., at 7). All that matters here, and all that should have mattered to the Sixth Circuit, is that we have not held thatCronicapplies to the circumstances presented in this case. For that reason, federal habeas relief based uponCronicis unavailable.The petition for a writ of certiorari and respondent's motion to proceedin forma pauperisare granted. The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered."}

Petitioners claimed that the rule violated the Second Amendment. Petitioners sought declaratory and injunctive relief against enforcement of the rule insofar as the rule prevented their transport of firearms to a second home or shooting range outside of the city. The District Court and the Court of Appeals rejected petitioners’ claim. See F.3d ( ). We granted certiorari. U. S. After we granted certiorari, the State of New York amended its firearm licensing statute, and the City amended the rule so that petitioners may now transport firearms to a second home or shooting range outside of the city, which is the precise relief that petitioners requested in the prayer for relief in their complaint. App. . Petitioners’ claim for declaratory and injunctive relief with respect to the City’s old rule is therefore moot. Petitioners now argue, however, that the new rule may still infringe their rights. In particular, petitioners claim that they may not be allowed to stop for coffee, gas, food, or restroom breaks on the way to their second homes or shooting ranges outside of the city. The City responds that those routine stops are entirely permissible under the new rule. We do not here decide that dispute about the new rule; as we stated inLewisv.Continental Bank Corp., U.S. , – ():“Our ordinary practice in disposing of a case that has become moot on appeal is to vacate the judgment with directions to dismiss.

However, in instances where the mootness is attributable to a change in the legal framework governing the case, and where the plaintiff may have some residual claim under the new framework that was understandably not asserted previously, our practice is to vacate the judgment and remand for further proceedings in which the parties may, if necessary, amend their pleadings or develop the record more fully. SeeDiffenderferv.Central Baptist Church of Miami,Inc., U.S. , ().”Petitioners also argue that, even though they have not previously asked for damages with respect to the City’s old rule, they still could do so in this lawsuit. Petitioners did not seek damages in their complaint; indeed, the possibility of a damages claim was not raised until well into the litigation in this Court. The City argues that it is too late for petitioners to now add a claim for damages.

{"file_name": "per curiam_2009_838_556.json", "author": "per curiam", "year": 2009, "text": "–. Decided June 1, 2009Per Curiam.The Federal Employers’ Liability Act (FELA), Stat. , as amended, provides that employees of common-carrier railroads may recover for work-related injuries caused in whole or in part by their railroad-employer’s negligence. See U. S. C. §§–. In this case respondent Thurston Hensley sued petitioner CSX Transportation, Inc., in Tennessee state court. Hensley, who was employed by CSX as an electrician, alleged that the railroad negligently caused him to contract asbestosis—a noncancerous scarring of lung tissue caused by long-term exposure to asbestos.Hensley sought pain-and-suffering damages from CSX based on, among other things, his fear of developing lung cancer in the future. The Court addressed this subject inNorfolk & Western R. Co.v.Ayers, U. S. (), and held that those types of damages are available in certain FELA cases. The Court stated:“Norfolk presented the question whether a plaintiff who has asbestosis but not cancer can recover damages for fear of cancer under the FELA without proof of physical manifestations of the claimed emotional distress. Our answer is yes, with an important reservation. We affirm only the qualification of an asbestosis sufferer to seek compensation for fear of cancer as an element of his asbestosis-related pain and suffering damages. It is incumbent upon such a complainant, however, to prove that his alleged fear is genuine and serious.”Id., at (internal quotation marks, citation, and alteration omitted).At the close of a 3-week trial, Hensley and CSX submitted proposed jury instructions to the trial court. CSX proposed two instructions—requests and —related to Hensley’s claim for fear-of-cancer damages. Request stated the basic requirements to obtain those damages underAyers. Supp. Tech. Record, Exh. A, p. 4 (“Plaintiff is also alleging that he suffers from a compensable fear of cancer. In order to recover, Plaintiff must demonstrate ... that the ... fear is genuine and serious”). Request stated certain factors the jury could consider in applying theAyersstandard.Id., at 5–6. The trial court denied both requests over CSX’s objections, and the jury was not instructed as to the legal standard for fear-of-cancer damages. Tr. –; 20id., at –. After two hours of deliberations, the jury found for Hensley and awarded him $5 million in damages.The Tennessee Court of Appeals affirmed. S. W. 3d (). It described our opinion inAyersas “specifically limit[ed]” to the “narrow issue” of whether a FELA plaintiff with asbestosis can recover for fear of cancer. S. W. 3d, at . According to the Tennessee Court of Appeals,Ayers“did not discuss or authorize jury instructions on this issue, but merely ruled on substantive law.” S. W. 3d, at (internal quotation marks omitted). The Tennessee Court of Appeals also reasoned that “little if any purpose would be served by instructing the jury that the plaintiff’s fear must be ‘genuine and serious.’ ”Ibid.That is because “the mere suggestion of the possibility of cancer has the potential to evoke raw emotions,” and “[a]ny juror who might be predisposed to grant a large award based on shaky evidence of a fear of cancer is unlikely to be swayed by the language ofAyers.”Ibid.Instead, the Tennessee Court of Appeals stated, “it is for the courts to serve as gatekeepers” by ensuring that fear-of-cancer claims “do notgoto the jury unless there is credible evidence of a ‘genuine and serious’ fear.”Ibid.CSX petitioned for certiorari, arguing that the Tennessee Court of Appeals misread and misapplied this Court’s decision inAyers. CSX’s contention is correct. The ruling of the Tennessee Court of Appeals, and the refusal of the trial court to give an instruction, were clear error. Contrary to the assertion of the Tennessee Court of Appeals, theAyersCourt expressly recognized that several “verdict control devices [are] available to the trial court” when a FELA plaintiff seeks fear-of-cancer damages. U. S., at , n. . Those “include, on a defendant’s request, a charge that each plaintiff must prove any alleged fear to be genuine and serious.”Ibid.CSX requested an instruction on the substance of the genuine-and-serious standard, and the trial court erred by not giving one.The reasons given by the Tennessee Court of Appeals for upholding the denial of an instruction on the standard do not withstand scrutiny. The court stated that instructing the jury on the legal standard for fear-of-cancer damages would have been futile because cancer touches many lives and therefore “evoke[s] [jurors’] raw emotions.” S. W. 3d, at . This is a serious misunderstanding of the nature and function of the jury. The jury system is premised on the idea that rationality and careful regard for the court’s instructions will confine and exclude jurors’ raw emotions. Jurors routinely serve as impartial factfinders in cases that involve sensitive, even life-and-death matters. In those cases, as in all cases, juries are presumed to follow the court’s instructions. SeeGreerv.Miller, U. S. , , n. 8 (). And the trial court in this case correctly instructed the jury as to its legal duty to “follow all of the instructions.” Tr. .Instructing the jury on the standard for fear-of-cancer damages would not have been futile. To the contrary, the fact that cancer claims could “evoke raw emotions” is a powerful reason to instruct the jury on the proper legal standard. Giving the instruction on this point is particularly important in the FELA context. That is because of the volume of pending asbestos claims and also because the nature of those claims enhances the danger that a jury, without proper instructions, could award emotional-distress damages based on slight evidence of a plaintiff’s fear of contracting cancer. But as this Court said inAyers, more is required. Although plaintiffs can seek fear-of-cancer damages in some FELA cases, they must satisfy a high standard in order to obtain them. U. S., at –, and n. . Refusing defendants’ requests to instruct the jury as to that high standard would render it all but meaningless.It is no answer that, as the Tennessee Court of Appeals stated, courts can apply theAyersstandard when ruling on sufficiency-of-the-evidence challenges. To be sure,Ayersrecognized that a “review of the evidence on damages for sufficiency” is another of the “verdict control devices” available to courts when plaintiffs seek fear-of-cancer damages.Id., at , n. . But a determination that there is sufficient evidence to send a claim to a jury is not the same as a determination that a plaintiff has met the burden of proof and should succeed on a claim outright. Put another way, a properly instructed jury could find that a plaintiff’s fear is not “genuine and serious” even when there is legally sufficient evidence for the jury to rule for the plaintiff on the issue. That is whyAyersrecognized that sufficiency reviews and jury instructions are important and separate protections against imposing unbounded liability on asbestos defendants in fear-of-cancer claims.When this Court inAyersheld that certain FELA plaintiffs can recover based on their fear of developing cancer, it struck a delicate balance between plaintiffs and defendants—and it did so against the backdrop of systemic difficulties posed by the “elephantine mass of asbestos cases.”Id., at (internal quotation marks omitted). Jury instructions stating the proper standard for fear-of-cancer damages were part of that balance,id., at , n. , and courts must give such instructions upon a defendant’s request. The ruling of the Tennessee Court of Appeals conflicts withAyers. The trial court should have given the substance of the requested instructions. See alsoHedgecorthv.Union Pacific R. Co., S.

{"file_name": "per curiam_2010_220_558.json", "author": "per curiam", "year": 2010, "text": "–. Decided January , 2010Per Curiam.From beginning to end, judicial proceedings conducted for the purpose of deciding whether a defendant shall be put to death must be conducted with dignity and respect. The disturbing facts of this case raise serious questions concerning the conduct of the trial, and this petition raises a serious question about whether the Court of Appeals carefully reviewed those facts before addressing petitioner’s constitutional claims. We know that the Court of Appeals committed the same procedural error that we corrected inConev.Bell, U. S., at –). We do not know how the court would have ruled if it had the benefit of our decision in that case.Petitioner Marcus Wellons was convicted in Georgia state court of rape and murder and sentenced to death. Although the trial looked typical, there were unusual events going on behind the scenes. Only after the trial did defense counsel learn that there had been unreportedex partecontacts between the jury and the judge, that jurors and a bailiff had planned a reunion, and that “either during or immediately following the penalty phase, some jury members gave the trial judge chocolate shaped as male genitalia and the bailiff chocolate shaped as female breasts,” F. 3d , ( ). The judge had not reported any of this to the defense.Neither Wellons nor any court has ascertained exactly what went on at this capital trial or what prompted such “gifts.” Wellons has repeatedly tried, in both state and federal court, to find out what occurred, but he has found himself caught in a procedural morass: He raised the issue on direct appeal but was constrained by the nonexistent record, and the State Supreme Court affirmed his conviction and sentence.Wellonsv.State, Ga. , , S. E. 2d , (). He sought state habeas relief and moved to develop evidence. But the court held that the matter had been decided on appeal and thus was res judicata. See F. 3d, at . He raised the issue again in his federal habeas petition, seeking discovery and an evidentiary hearing. But the District Court “concluded that Wellons’ claims ... were procedurally barred, and accordingly denied his motion for an evidentiary hearing on these claims.”Id., at .[Footnote 1] Before the Eleventh Circuit, Wellons “argue[d] that the district court erred in denying his motions for discovery and an evidentiary hearing to develop his judge, juror, and bailiff misconduct claims because they are not procedurally barred.”Id., at . The court disagreed, holding that Wellons’ claims were procedurally barred.Ibid.As our dissenting colleagues acknowledge,post, at 1 (opinion of [REDACTED], J.);post, at 1 (opinion of [REDACTED], J.), the Eleventh Circuit’s holding was an error underCone, U. S., at –). “When a state court declines to review the merits of a petitioner’s claim on the ground that it has done so already, it creates no bar to federal habeas review.”Id., at __ (slip op., at ). Both dissenting opinions assume that “the issue on whichConethrows light does not affect the outcome” because “the Eleventh Circuit ... also decided that petitioner was not entitled to habeas reliefon the merits.”Post, at 1–2 (opinion of [REDACTED], J.). Having found a procedural bar, however, the Eleventh Circuit had no need to address whether petitioner was otherwise entitled to an evidentiary hearing and gave this question, at most, perfunctory consideration that may well have turned on the District Court’s finding of a procedural bar.Although Wellons appealed the denial of “his motions for discovery and an evidentiary hearing,” F. 3d, at , the Eleventh Circuit did not purport to address the merits ofthatissue at all.[Footnote 2] The court stated only that “[e]ven if we assume that Wellons’s misconduct claims are not procedurally barred, they do not entitle Wellons to habeasrelief.”Id., at (emphasis added). This opaque statement appears to address only whether petitioner was entitled to ultimate relief in the form of a new trial, not whether petitioner’s allegations, combined with the facts he had learned, entitled him to the discovery and evidentiary hearing that he sought.The Eleventh Circuit’s reasoning does not suggest otherwise. The court observed that Wellons’ claims of misconduct were “grounded in his speculation as to the meaning underlying the jurors’ chocolate ‘gifts’ ” and “the surmise attached to their passive receipt of these gifts.”Ibid.This statement likewise indicates only that on the existing record, habeas relief was inappropriate, not that an evidentiary hearing should be denied. After all, had there been discovery or an evidentiary hearing, Wellons may have been able to present more than “speculation” and “surmise.” The Eleventh Circuit also pointed to the state court’s decision on direct appeal, seeid., at , and reviewed that decision “[i]n light of the evidence presented before the Georgia Supreme Court,”ibid. This, too, is typical of a court reviewing the denial of habeas relief, not the denial of discovery or an evidentiary hearing.[Footnote 3]Moreover, even assuming that the Eleventh Circuit intended to address Wellons’ motions for discovery and an evidentiary hearing, we cannot be sure that its reasoning really was independent of theConeerror. The fact that his claims rested on “speculation” and “surmise” was due to the absence of a record, which was in part based on theConeerror. And as the Eleventh Circuit’s reasoning turned on “the evidence presented before the Georgia Supreme Court,” F. 3d, at , there is serious doubt about whether it necessarily relied on the very holes in the record that Wellons was trying to fill.Our dissenting colleagues allege that the Court is “degrad[ing] ... our traditional requirements for a GVR.”Post, at 2 (opinion of [REDACTED], J.); seepost, at 4 (opinion of [REDACTED], J.). But the standard for an order granting certiorari, vacating the judgment below, and remanding the case (GVR) remains as it always has been: A GVR is appropriate when “intervening developments ... reveal a reasonable probability that the decision below rests upon a premise that the lower court would reject if given the opportunity for further consideration, and where it appears that such a redetermination may determine the ultimate outcome” of the matter.Lawrencev.Chater, U. S. , ()(per curiam). As already discussed, there is, at least, a “reasonable probability,”ibid., that the denial of discovery and an evidentiary hearing rested in part on theConeerror. And in light of the unusual facts of the case, a “redetermination may determine the ultimate outcome,” U. S., at ; cf.Williamsv.Taylor, U. S. , () (holding that several “omissions as a whole disclose the need for an evidentiary hearing”);Smithv.Phillips, U. S. , () (“This Court has long held that the remedy for allegations of juror partiality is a hearing in which the defendant has an opportunity to prove actual bias”). The Eleventh Circuit’s opinion is ambiguous in significant respects. It would be highly inappropriate to assume away that ambiguity in respondent’s favor. That is especially so in a case in which petitioner’s allegations and the unusual facts raise a serious question about the fairness of a capital trial.Both dissenting opinions suggest that if there is a strong case for discovery and an evidentiary hearing, then the Court “should summarily reverse or set the case for argument.”Post, at 2 (opinion of [REDACTED], J.); see alsopost, at 4–5 (opinion of [REDACTED], J.). But as we have explained, “a GVR order conserves the scarce resources of this Court,” “assists the court below by flagging a particular issue that it does not appear to have fully considered,” and “assists this Court by procuring the benefit of the lower court’s insight before we rule on the merits.”Lawrence,supra, at .Unlike [REDACTED],post, at 3, we do not believe that a “self-respecting” court of appeals would or should respond to our remand order with a “summary reissuance” of essentially the same opinion, absent the procedural default discussion. To the contrary, in light of our decision inCone,we assume the court will consider, on the merits, whether petitioner’s allegations, together with the undisputed facts, warrant discovery and an evidentiary hearing.The petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit and the motion of petitioner for leave to proceedin forma pauperisare granted. The judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded to the Eleventh Circuit for further consideration in light ofConev.Bell, U. S., at –).Footnote 1Although the District Court found most of petitioner’s claims to be procedurally barred, it alternatively declined to permit an evidentiary hearing because Wellons did not have enough evidence of bias or misconduct. [REDACTED] wrongly suggests that the District Court reached that conclusion by reviewing a proffer that Wellons’ attorneys assembled by “contacting all but 1 of the jurors,” many of whom “spoke freely.”Post, at 2 (dissenting opinion). Even apart from the fact that these interviews were informal and unsworn, they shed almost no light on what had occurred. The juror who allegedly “gave the penis to the judge,” App. C to Pet. for Cert. , was “hostile and refused to talk,”id., at ; one “refused to talk about the trial,”id., at ; another “did not want to talk about the case,”id., at ; and one “conferr[ed]” with his wife who then “slammed and bolted the door,”ibid.Of those jurors who were willing to talk at all, one admitted to being “concerned that she might say something that would be used for a mistrial,”id., at , and none admitted to knowing how or why the jury selected its “gifts,” seeid., at –, . (Implausibly, [REDACTED] suggests that Wellons’ lawyers may not have asked how or why the jury selected its “gifts,”post, at 3, though he bases that speculation only on the fact that noquestionsappeared in the proffer offacts.) Rather, the jurors discussed other matters and did so in the briefest of terms. All told, “everything that Petitioner ... learned,” App. C to Pet. for Cert. , filled only a few sheets of paper, seeid., at –, .Moreover, the subjects that the jurors did discuss may very well support Wellons’ view that his trial was tainted by bias or misconduct. For example, one interviewee “was surprised” that a fellow juror had been allowed to serve on a capital trial, given that her sister had been murdered by a man after he completed serving a life sentence.Id.,at .Footnote 2As [REDACTED] explains at some length, seepost, at 2–4, theDistrict Courtdid discuss the merits of that issue, but the District Court’s analysis has little relevance on whether the Court of Appeals made an alternative holding or rather affirmed the District Court’s decision on the ground that petitioner’s claim was procedurally barred.Footnote 3Justice [REDACTED] asserts that the Eleventh Circuit “stated in unequivocal terms that its holding on the merits of petitioner’s claim was independent of its holding on the question of procedural default.”Post, at 1. But that does not address the question: The merits of what? The question whether to grant habeas relief or whether to permit discovery and an evidentiary hearing?Contrary to our dissenting colleagues,post,at 4 (opinion of [REDACTED], J.), we do not find it dispositive that the section of the Eleventh Circuit’s opinion about judge, juror, and bailiff misconduct began with a full page statement of the standard of review, which in turn included a sentence about the circumstances under which an evidentiary hearing is warranted. See F. 3d, at –. Immediately following the standard of review that [REDACTED] quotes, the panel explained that “ ‘if the record ... precludes habeas relief, a district court is not required to hold an evidentiary hearing,’ ” and that “the record reveals that [Wellons’] claims ... are procedurally barred.”Id., at .Moreover, the allegedly “unequivocal” holding that [REDACTED] quotes was preceded by a discussion of the deference owed under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of (AEDPA) to the “Georgia Supreme Court’s judgment as to the substance and effect of the ex parte communication.”Id., at . This is the classic formulation of a decision of whether to grant habeas relief. Indeed, it would be bizarre if a federal court had to defer to state-court factual findings, made without any evidentiary record, in order to decide whether it could create an evidentiary record to decide whether the factual findings were erroneous. If that were the case, then almost no habeas petitioner could ever get an evidentiary hearing: So long as the state court found a fact that the petitioner was trying to disprove through the presentation of evidence, then there could be no hearing. AEDPA does not require such a crabbed and illogical approach to habeas procedures, and there is no reason to believe that the Eleventh Circuit thought otherwise."}
{"file_name": "per curiam_2020_19-5421_589.json", "author": "per curiam", "year": 2020, "text": "–. Decided March , 2020Per Curiam.In July , police officers in Dallas, Texas, received a tip about a suspicious car parked outside of a house in the Dallas area. The officers approached the car and encountered Charles Davis in the driver’s seat. They ordered him out of the car after smelling marijuana. As Davis exited the car, the officers spotted a black semiautomatic handgun in the door compartment. They then searched Davis and found methamphetamine pills.Davis had previously been convicted of two state felonies. In this case, a federal grand jury in the Northern District of Texas indicted Davis for being a felon in possession of a firearm, U. S. C. §§(g)(1), (a)(2), and for possessing drugs with the intent to distribute them, U. S. C. §§(a)(1), (b)(1)(C). Davis pleaded guilty to both counts. The presentence report prepared by the probation office noted that Davis was also facing pending drug and gun charges in Texas courts stemming from a separate state arrest. The District Court sentenced Davis to four years and nine months in prison and ordered that his sentence run consecutively to any sentences that the state courts might impose for his state offenses. Davis did not object to the sentence or to its consecutive nature.Davis appealed to the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. On appeal, he argued for the first time that the District Court erred by ordering his federal sentence to run consecutively to any sentence that the state courts might impose for his state offenses. Davis contended that his state offenses and his federal offenses were part of the “same course of conduct,” meaning under the Sentencing Guidelines that the sentences should have run concurrently, not consecutively. See United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual §§.3(a)(2), .3(c) (Nov. ).In the Fifth Circuit, Davis acknowledged that he had failed to raise that argument in the District Court. When a criminal defendant fails to raise an argument in the district court, an appellate court ordinarily may review the issue only for plain error. See Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. (b).But the Fifth Circuit refused to entertain Davis’ argument at all. The Fifth Circuit did not employ plain-error review because the court characterized Davis’ argument as raising factual issues, and under Fifth Circuit precedent, “[q]uestions of fact capable of resolution by the district court upon proper objection at sentencing can never constitute plain error.” Fed. Appx. () (per curiam) (quotingUnited Statesv.Lopez, F.2d , () (per curiam)). By contrast, almost every other Court of Appeals conducts plain-error review of unpreserved arguments, including unpreserved factual arguments. See,e.g., United Statesv.González-Castillo, F.3d , – ( );United Statesv.Romeo, Fed. Appx. , – ( );United Statesv.Griffiths, Fed. Appx. , – ( );United Statesv.Wells, F.3d , ( );United Statesv.Sargent, Fed. Appx. , ( ) (per curiam);United Statesv.Durham, F.3d , – ( );United Statesv.Sahakian, Fed. Appx. , ( );United Statesv.[REDACTED], Fed. Appx. , – ( ) (per curiam);United Statesv.Saro, F.3d , (CADC ).In this Court, Davis challenges the Fifth Circuit’s outlier practice of refusing to review certain unpreserved factual arguments for plain error. We agree with Davis, and we vacate the judgment of the Fifth Circuit.Rule (b) states in full: “A plain error that affects substantial rights may be considered even though it was not brought to the court’s attention.” The text of Rule (b) does not immunize factual errors from plain-error review. Our cases likewise do not purport to shield any category of errors from plain-error review. See generallyRosales- Mirelesv.United States, U. S.Olano, U.S. (). Put simply, there is no legal basis for the Fifth Circuit’s practice of declining to review certain unpreserved factual arguments for plain error.The petition for certiorari and the motion for leave to proceedin forma pauperisare granted, the judgment of the Fifth Circuit is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. We express no opinion on whether Davis has satisfied the plain-error standard.It is so ordered."}
{"file_name": "per curiam_2016_15-789_578.json", "author": "per curiam", "year": 2016, "text": "–. Decided May , 2016Per Curiam.Federal habeas courts generally refuse to hear claims “defaulted . . . in state court pursuant to an independent and adequate state procedural rule.”Colemanv.Thompson, U.S. , (). State rules count as “adequate” if they are “firmly established and regularly followed.”Walkerv.Martin, U.S. , () (internal quotation marks omitted). Like all States, California requires criminal defendants to raise available claims on direct appeal. Under the so-called “Dixonbar,” a defendant procedurally defaults a claim raised for the first time on state collateral review if he could have raised it earlier on direct appeal. SeeIn re Dixon, Cal. 2d , , P.2d , (). Yet, in this case, the Ninth Circuit held that theDixonbar is inadequate to bar fed- eral habeas review. Because California’s procedural bar is longstanding, oft-cited, and shared by habeas courts across the Nation, this Court now summarily reverses the Ninth Circuit’s judgment.IRespondent Donna Kay Lee and her boyfriend Paul Carasi stabbed to death Carasi’s mother and his ex-girlfriend. A California jury convicted the pair of two counts each of first-degree murder. Carasi received a death sentence, and Lee received a sentence of life without the possibility of parole. In June , Lee unsuccessfully raised four claims on direct appeal. After the California appellate courts affirmed, Lee skipped state postconviction review and filed the federal habeas petition at issue. See U. S. C. §(a). The petition raised mostly new claims that Lee failed to raise on direct appeal. Because Lee had not exhausted available state-court remedies, however, the District Court temporarily stayed federal proceedings to allow Lee to pursue her new claims in a state habeas petition. The California Supreme Court denied Lee’s petition in a summary order citingDixon.Having exhausted state remedies, Lee returned to federal court to litigate her federal habeas petition. The District Court dismissed her new claims as procedurally defaulted. Then, for the first time on appeal, Lee challenged theDixonbar’s adequacy. In her brief, Lee presented a small sample of the California Supreme Court’s state habeas denials on a single day about six months after her default. Lee claimed that out of the summary denials on December , , the court failed to citeDixonin 9 cases where it should have been applied. The court instead denied the nine petitions without any citation at all. In Lee’s view, these missing citations proved that the California courts inconsistently applied theDixonbar. Without evaluating this evidence, the Ninth Circuit reversed and remanded “to permit the Warden to submit evidence to the contrary, and for consideration by the district court in the first instance.”Leev.Jacquez, Fed. Appx. , ().On remand, the warden submitted a study analyzing more than 4, summary habeas denials during a nearly 2-year period around the time of Lee’s procedural default. From August to June , the study showed, the California Supreme Court citedDixonin approximately % of all denials—more than times. In light of this evidence, the District Court held that theDixonbar is adequate.The Ninth Circuit again reversed.Leev.Jacquez, F.3d (). Lee’s 1-day sample proved theDixonbar’s inadequacy, the court held, because the “failure to citeDixonwhereDixonapplies . . . reflects [its] irregular application.” F. 3d, at . The general % citation rate proved nothing, the court reasoned, because the warden “d[id] not purport to show to how many cases theDixonbarshouldhave been applied.”Id.,at . In the Ninth Circuit’s view, without this “baseline number” the warden’s 2-year study was “entirely insufficient” to proveDixon’s adequacy. F. 3d, at .IIThe Ninth Circuit’s decision profoundly misapprehends what makes a state procedural bar “adequate.” That question is a matter of federal law.Leev.Kemna, U.S. , (). “To qualify as an ‘adequate’ procedural ground,” capable of barring federal habeas review, “a state rule must be ‘firmly established and regularly followed.’ ”Martin,supra, at (quotingBeardv.Kindler, U.S. , ()).California’sDixonbar satisfies both adequacy criteria. It is “firmly established” because, decades before Lee’s June procedural default, the California Supreme Court warned defendants in plain terms that, absent “special circumstances,” habeas “will not lie where the claimed errors could have been, but were not, raised upon a timely appeal from a judgment of conviction.”Dixon,supra, at , P. 2d, at . And the California Supreme Court eliminated any arguable ambiguity surrounding this bar by reaffirmingDixonin two cases decided before Lee’s default. SeeIn re Harris,5 Cal. 4th , , n. 3, –, P.2d , , n. 3, – ();In re Robbins, Cal. 4th , –, and n. , P.2d , –, and n. ().The California Supreme Court’s repeatedDixoncitations also prove that the bar is “regularly followed.”Martinrecently held that another California procedural bar—a rule requiring prisoners to file state habeas petitions promptly—met that requirement because “[e]ach year, the California Supreme Court summarily denies hundreds of habeas petitions by citing” the timeliness rule. U. S., at . The same goes forDixon. Nine purportedly missingDixoncitations from Lee’s 1-day sample of summary orders hardly support an inference of inconsistency. SeeDuggerv.Adams, U.S. , , n. 6 () (holding that the Florida Supreme Court applied its similar procedural bar “consistently and regularly” despite “address[ing] the merits in several cases raising [new] claims on postconviction review”). Indeed, all nine orders in that sample were denials. None ignored theDixonbar tograntrelief, so there is no sign of inconsistency.Nor is California’s rule unique. Federal and state ha- beas courts across the country follow the same rule asDixon. “The general rule in federal habeas cases is that a defendant who fails to raise a claim on direct appeal is barred from raising the claim on collateral review.”Sanchez-Llamasv.Oregon, U.S. , – (). Likewise, state postconviction remedies generally “may not be used to litigate claims which were or could have been raised at trial or on direct appeal.” 1 D. Wilkes, State Postconviction Remedies and Relief Handbook §1:2, p. 3 (– ed.). It appears that every State shares this procedural bar in some form. See Brief for State of Alabama et al. asAmici , n. 2 (collecting citations). For such well-established and ubiquitous rules, it takes more than a few outliers to show inadequacy. Federal habeas courts must not lightly “disregard state procedural rules that are substantially similar to those to which we give full force in our own courts.”Kindler, U. S., at . And it would be “[e]ven stranger to do so with respect to rules in place in nearly every State.”Ibid.Nothing suggests, moreover, that California courts apply theDixonbar in a way that disfavors federal claims. The Court therefore holds that it qualifies as adequate to bar federal habeas review.IIIThe Ninth Circuit’s contrary reasoning is unpersuasive and inconsistent with this Court’s precedents. Applying theDixonbar may be a “straightforward” or “mechanica[l]” task for state courts. F. 3d, at . But simplicity does not imply that missing citations reflect state-court inconsistency. To begin with, since theDixonbar has several exceptions, seeRobbins,supra, at –, and n. , P. 2d, at –, and n. , the California Supreme Court can hardly be faulted for failing to citeDixonwhenever a petitioner raises a claim that he could have raised on direct appeal.More importantly, California courts need not address procedural default before reaching the merits, so the purportedly missing citations show nothing. Cf.Bellv.Cone, U.S. , , n. 3 () (per curiam) (declining to address the warden’s procedural-default argument);Lambrixv.Singletary, U.S. , () (explaining that “[ j]udicial economy might counsel” bypassing a procedural-default question if the merits “were easily resolvable against the habeas petitioner”). Ordinarily, “procedural default . . . is not a jurisdictional matter.”Trestv.Cain, U.S. , (). As a result, the appropriate order of analysis for each case remains within the state courts’ discretion. Such discretion will often lead to “seeming inconsistencies.”Martin, U. S., at , and n. 7. But that superficial tension does not make a procedural bar inadequate. “[A] state procedural bar may count as an adequate and independent ground for denying a federal habeas petition even if the state court had discretion to reach the merits despite the default.”Id., at ; seeKindler,supra, at –.The Ninth Circuit’s attempt to get aroundMartinandKindlerfails. The Court of Appeals distinguished those cases on the ground that California’sDixonbar is “man- datory” rather than discretionary because it involves a discretion-free general rule, notwithstanding exceptions that might involve discretion. F. 3d, at . The Court assumes, without deciding, that this description is accurate and theDixonbar’s exceptions leave some room for discretion. Even so, there is little difference between discretion exercised through an otherwise adequate procedural bar’s exceptions and discretion that is a part of the bar itself. In any event, the Ninth Circuit’s reasoning ignores the state courts’ discretion to assume, without deciding, that a claim is not procedurally defaulted and instead hold that the claim lacks merit.The Ninth Circuit was accordingly wrong to dismiss the -plus summary denials citingDixonsimply because they do not reveal which cases potentially implicate the bar. F. 3d, at .Martinalready rejected this precise reasoning. There, the habeas petitioner unsuccessfully argued that “[u]se of summary denials makes it impossible to tell why the California Supreme Court decides some delayed petitions on the merits and rejects others as untimely.” U. S., at (internal quotation marks omitted). So too here, “[w]e see no reason to reject California’s [procedural] bar simply because a court may opt to bypass the e see no reason to reject California’s [procedural] bar simply because a court may opt to bypass the [Dixon] assessment and summarily dismiss a petition on the merits, if that is the easier path.”Ibid.By treating every missing citation as a sign of inconsistency, the Court of Appeals “pose[d] an unnecessary dilemma” for California.Kindler, U. S., at . The court forced the State to choose between the “finality of [its] judgments” and a burdensome opinion-writing requirement.Ibid.; seeMartin,supra, at – (noting that the California Supreme Court “rules on a staggering number of habeas petitions each year”);Harringtonv.Richter, U.S. , () (discussing the advantages of summary dispositions). “[F]ederal courts have no authority,” however, “to impose mandatory opinion-writing standards on state courts” as the price of federal respect for their procedural rules.Johnsonv.Williams, U. S., at 9). The Ninth Circuit’s decision is thus fundamentally at odds with the “federalism and comity concerns that motivate the adequate state ground doctrine in the habeas context.”Kindler,supra, at .* * *“A State’s procedural rules are of vital importance to the orderly administration of its criminal courts; when a federal court permits them to be readily evaded, it undermines the criminal justice system.”Lambrix,supra, at . Here, the Ninth Circuit permitted California prisoners to evade a well-established procedural bar that is adequate to bar federal habeas review. The petition for a writ of certiorari and respondent’s motion to proceedin forma pauperisare granted.

Decided January 7, 2019Per Curiam.The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit held that respondent Danny Hill, who has been sentenced to death in Ohio, is entitled to habeas relief under U. S. C. §(d)(1) because the decisions of the Ohio courts concluding that he is not intellectually disabled were contrary to Supreme Court precedent that was clearly established at the time in question. In reaching this de- cision, the Court of Appeals relied repeatedly and extensively on our decision inMoorev.Texas, U. S.The Court of Appeals’ reliance onMoorewas plainly improper under §(d)(1), and we therefore vacate that decision and remand so that Hill’s claim regarding intellectual disability can be evaluated based solely on holdings of this Court that were clearly established at the relevant time.IIn September , -year old Raymond Fife set out on his bicycle for a friend’s home. When he did not arrive, his parents launched a search, and that evening his father found Raymond—naked, beaten, and burned—in a wooded field. Although alive, he had sustained horrific injuries that we will not describe. He died two days later.In , respondent Danny Hill was convicted for torturing, raping, and murdering Raymond, and he was sentenced to death. An intermediate appellate court affirmed his conviction and sentence, as did the Ohio Supreme Court. We denied certiorari.Hillv.Ohio, U. S. ().After unsuccessful efforts to obtain postconviction relief in state and federal court, Hill filed a new petition in the Ohio courts contending that his death sentence is illegal underAtkinsv.Virginia, U. S. (), which held that the Eighth Amendment prohibits the imposition of a death sentence on a defendant who is “mentally retarded.” In , the Ohio trial court denied this claim, App. to Pet. for Cert. 381a–493a, and in , the Ohio Court of Appeals affirmed,Statev.Hill, Ohio App. 3d , -Ohio-, N. E. 2d . In , the Ohio Supreme Court denied review.Statev.Hill, Ohio St. 3d , -Ohio-, N. E. 2d .In , Hill filed a new federal habeas petition under U. S. C. §, seeking review of the denial of hisAtkinsclaim. The District Court denied the petition, App. to Pet. for Cert. 77a–210a, but the Sixth Circuit reversed and granted habeas relief under §(d)(1), which applies when a state-court adjudication “resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.” SeeHillv.Anderson, F. 3d (). The Sixth Circuit found two alleged deficiencies in the Ohio courts’ decisions: First, they “overemphasized Hill’s adaptive strengths”; and second, they “relied too heavily on adaptive strengths that Hill exhibited in the controlled environment of his death-row prison cell.”Id., at . In reaching these conclusions, the court relied repeatedly on our decision inMoorev.Texas, U. S. See F. 3d, at , , , n. 4, , , , , , , , . The court acknowledged that “[o]rdinarily, Supreme Court decisions that post-date a state court’s determination cannot be ‘clearly established law’ for the purposes of [the federal habeas statute],” but the court argued “thatMoore’s holding regarding adaptive strengths [was] merely an application of what was clearly established byAtkins.”Id.,at .The State filed a petition for a writ of certiorari, contending that the Sixth Circuit violated §(d)(1) because a fundamental underpinning of its decision wasMoore, a case decided by this Court well after the Ohio courts’ decisions. Against this, Hill echoes the Court of Appeals’ argument thatMooremerely spelled out what was clearly established byAtkinsregarding the assessment of adaptive skills.IIThe federal habeas statute, as amended by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of (AEDPA), imposes important limitations on the power of federal courts to overturn the judgments of state courts in criminal cases. The statute respects the authority and ability of state courts and their dedication to the protection of constitutional rights. Thus, under the statutory provision at issue here, U. S. C. §(d)(1), habeas relief may be granted only if the state court’s adjudication “resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of,” Supreme Court precedent that was “clearly established” at the time of the adjudication.E.g., Whitev.Woodall, U. S. , – ();Metrishv.Lancaster, U. S. , – (). This means that a state court’s ruling must be “so lacking in justification that there was an error well understood and comprehended in existing law beyond any possibility for fairminded dis- agreement.”Harringtonv.Richter, U. S. , (). We therefore consider what was clearly established regarding the execution of the intellectually dis- abled in , when the Ohio Court of Appeals rejected Hill’sAtkinsclaim.Of course,Atkinsitself was on the books, butAtkinsgave no comprehensive definition of “mental retardation” for Eighth Amendment purposes.[1] The opinion of the Court noted that the definitions of mental retardation adopted by the American Association on Mental Retardation and the American Psychiatric Association required both “subaverage intellectual functioning” and “significant limitations in adaptive skills such as communication, self-care, and self-direction that became manifest before age .” U. S., at ; see alsoid.,at , n. 3 (quoting definitions). The Court also noted that state statutory definitions of mental retardation at the time “[were] not identical, but generally conform[ed] to the[se] clinical definitions.”Id.,at , n. . The Court then left “ ‘to the State[s] the task of developing appropriate ways to enforce the constitutional restriction’ ” that the Court adopted.Id., at (quotingFordv.Wainwright, U. S. , () (plurality opinion)).More than a decade later, we expounded on the definition of intellectual disability in two cases. InHallv.Florida, U. S. (), we considered a rule restrictingAtkinsto defendants with “an IQ test score of or less.” U. S., at . We held that this rule violated the Eighth Amendment because it treated an IQ score higher than as conclusively disqualifying and thus prevented consideration of other evidence of intellectual disability, such as evidence of “deficits in adaptive functioning over [the defendant’s] lifetime.”Id.,at .Three years later inMoore, we appliedHalland faulted the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals (CCA) for concluding that the petitioner’s IQ scores, some of which were at or below , established that he was not intellectually dis- abled.Moore, U. S. We also held that the CCA improperly evaluated the petitioner’s adaptive functioning. It erred, we concluded, in “overemphasiz[ing] [petitioner’s] perceived adaptive strengths,” despite the medical community’s focus on “adaptivedeficits.”Id., at ). And we found that the CCA also went astray in “stress[ing] [petitioner’s] improved behavior in prison,” even though the medical community “caution[ed] against reliance on adaptive strengths developed in a controlled setting, as a prison surely is.”Id., at ) (internal quotation marks omitted).IIIIn this case, no reader of the decision of the Court of Appeals can escape the conclusion that it is heavily based onMoore, which came years after the decisions of the Ohio courts. Indeed, the Court of Appeals, in finding an unreasonable application of clearly established law, drew almost word for word from the two statements inMoorequoted above. See F. 3d, at (“Contrary toAtkins, the Ohio courts overemphasized Hill’s adaptive strengths and relied too heavily on adaptive strengths that Hill exhibited in the controlled environment of his death-row prison cell. In so doing, they unreasonably applied clearly established law”). Although the Court of Appeals asserted that the holding inMoorewas “merely an application of what was clearly established byAtkins,” F. 3d, at , the court did not explain how the rule it applied can be teased out of theAtkinsCourt’s brief comments about the meaning of what it termed “mental retardation.” WhileAtkinsnoted that standard definitions of mental retardation included as a necessary element “significant limitations in adaptive skills . . . that became manifest before age ,” U. S., at ,Atkinsdid not definitively resolve how that element was to be evaluated but instead left its application in the first instance to the States.Id., at .Moreover, the posture in whichMoorereached this Court (it did not arise under AEDPA) and theMooremajority’s primary reliance on medical literature that postdated the Ohio courts’ decisions, U. S. Cf.Cainv.Chappell, F. 3d , , n. 9 ( ) (because “Mooreis not an AEDPA case” and was “decided just this spring,” “Mooreitself cannot serve as ‘clearly established’ law at the time the state court decided Cain’s claim”).IVThe centrality ofMoorein the Court of Appeals’ analysis is reflected in the way in which the intellectual-disability issue was litigated below. TheAtkinsportion of Hill’s habeas petition did not focus on §(d)(1), the provision on which the decision below is based.[2] Instead, it began and ended with appeals to a different provision of the habeas statute, §(d)(2), which supports relief based on a state court’s “unreasonable determination of the facts.” In particular, Hill opened with the claim that the Ohio courts’ findings on “adaptive functioning” “were an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence,” Amended Pet. for Habeas Corpus in No. –CV– (ND Ohio) (Doc. ), p. , ¶ (citing §(d)(2)), and he closed with the claim that the state trial court’s assessment that he is “not mentally retarded” was based on “an unreasonable determination of the facts,”id.,at –, ¶ (citing §(d)(2)). Indeed, Hill’s reply to the State’s answer to his petition explicitly “concur[red] . . . that it is proper to review [hisAtkinsclaim] under §(d)(2).” Traverse in No. –CV– (ND Ohio) (Doc. ), p. . And so, unsurprisingly, the District Court analyzed Hill’sAtkinsclaim solely under §(d)(2), noting that “[a]s Hill concedes in his Traverse, hisAtkinsclaim is more appropriately addressed as it relates to the Ohio appellate court’s factual analysis under §(d)(2).” App. to Pet. for Cert. 121a.Hill pressed the same §(d)(2) argument in his opening brief in the Sixth Circuit. There, he argued that the state courts’ finding on “adaptive functioning . . . was an unreasonable determination of the facts.” Brief for Petitioner–Appellant in No. – (), p. (citing §(d)(2)); see alsoid.,at (“As such, the state courts’ findings of fact that [Hill] is not mentally retarded constitute an unreasonable determination of facts in light of the evidence presented. (§(d)(2))”).It appears that it was not until the Court of Appeals asked for supplemental briefing onMoorethat Hill introduced the §(d)(1) argument that the Court of Appeals adopted. Although, as noted, the Court of Appeals ultimately disclaimed reliance onMoore, it explicitly asked the parties for supplemental briefing on howMoore“should be applied to this case.” Because the reasoning of the Court of Appeals leans so heavily onMoore, its decision must be vacated. On remand, the court should determine whether its conclusions can be sustained based strictly on legal rules that were clearly established in the decisions of this Court at the relevant time.* * *The petition for certiorari and Hill’s motion for leave to proceedin forma pauperisare granted, the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.Notes1The Court explained that it was “fair to say that a national consensus” had developed against the execution of “mentally retarded” offenders.Atkinsv.Virginia, U. S., , ().2While Hill’s petition argued at one point that certain unidentified “procedures” used by the state courts in making the relevant decisions “violated clearly established federal law ofFord/Panetti/Atkins,” Amended Pet. for Habeas Corpus in No. –CV– (ND Ohio) (Doc. ), p. , ¶, the petition plainly did not encompass his current argument that the Ohio Court of Appeals unreasonably applied clearly established law underAtkinsby overemphasizing adaptive strengths and improperly considering his prison behavior."}

Decided June , 2021Per Curiam.When a plaintiff alleges a regulatory taking in violation of the Fifth Amendment, a federal court should not consider the claim before the government has reached a “final” decision.Suitumv.Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, U.S. , (). After all, until the government makes up its mind, a court will be hard pressed to determine whether the plaintiff has suffered a constitutional violation.See id.,at ;Hornev.Department of Agriculture, U.S. , (). In the decision below, however, the Ninth Circuit required petitioners to show not only that the San Francisco Department of Public Works had firmly rejected their request for a property-law exemption (which they did show), butalsothat they had complied with the agency’s administrative procedures for seeking relief. Because the latter requirement is at odds with “the settled rule . . . that exhaustion of state remedies isnota prerequisite to an action under U. S. C. §, ”Knickv.Township of Scott, U. S., at 2) (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted), we vacate and remand.IPetitioners are a married couple who partially own a multiunit residential building in San Francisco. When petitioners purchased their interest in the property, the building was organized as a tenancy-in-common. Under that kind of arrangement, all owners technically have the right to possess and use the entire property, but in practice often contract among themselves to divide the premises into individual residences. Owners also frequently seek to convert tenancy-in-common interests into modern condominium-style arrangements, which allow individual ownership of certain parts of the building. When petitioners purchased their interest in the property, for example, they signed a contract with the other owners to take all available steps to pursue such a conversion.Until , the odds of conversion were slim because San Francisco employed a lottery system that accepted only applications per year. When that approach resulted in a predictable backlog, however, the city adopted a new program that allowed owners to seek conversion subject to a filing fee and several conditions. One of these was that nonoccupant owners who rented out their units had to offer their tenants a lifetime lease.Although petitioners had a renter living in their unit, they and their co-owners sought conversion. As part of the process, they agreed that they would offer a lifetime lease to their tenant. The city then approved the conversion. But, a few months later, petitioners requested that the city either excuse them from executing the lifetime lease or compensate them for the lease. The city refused both requests, informing petitioners that “failure to execute the lifetime lease violated the [program] and could result in an enforcement action.” Brief for Respondents 9.Petitioners sued in federal court under §. Among other things, they alleged that the lifetime-lease requirement was an unconstitutional regulatory taking. But the District Court rejected this claim without reaching the merits. WL , *2–*4 (ND Cal, Nov. , ). Instead, it relied on this Court’s since-disavowed prudential rule that certain takings actions are not “ripe” for federal resolution until the plaintiff “seek[s] compensation through the procedures the State has provided for doing so.”Williamson County Regional Planning Comm’nv.Hamilton Bank of Johnson City, U.S. , (). Because petitioners had not first brought “a state court inverse condemnation proceeding,” the District Court dismissed their claims. WL , *4.While petitioners’ appeal was pending before the Ninth Circuit, this Court repudiatedWilliamson County’s requirement that a plaintiff must seek compensation in state court. SeeKnick, U. S., at –). We explained that “[t]he Fifth Amendment right to full compensation arises at the time of the taking” and that “[t]he availability of any particular compensation remedy, such as an inverse condemnation claim under state law, cannot infringe or restrict the property owner’s federal constitutional claim.”Id., at 7–8). Any other approach, we reasoned, would conflict with “[t]he general rule . . . that plaintiffs may bring constitutional claims under § without first bringing any sort of state lawsuit.”Id., at ) (internal quotation marks omitted).Rather than remand petitioners’ claims in light ofKnick, a divided panel of the Ninth Circuit simply affirmed. Noting thatKnickleft untouchedWilliamsonCounty’s alternative holding that plaintiffs may challenge only “final” government decisions,Knick, U. S., at 5), the panel concluded that petitioners’ regulatory “takings claim remain[ed] unripe because they never obtained a final decision regarding the application of the Lifetime Lease Requirement to their Unit.” F.3d , ().[1] Although the city had twice denied their requests for the exemption—and in fact the “relevant agency c[ould] no longer grant” relief—the panel reasoned that this decision was not truly “final” because petitioners had made a belated request for an exemption at the end of the administrative process instead of timely seeking one “through the prescribed procedures.”Id., at – (explaining that petitioners waited “six months after [they] had obtained final approval of their conversion . . . and seven months after they had committed to offering a lifetime lease”). In other words, a conclusive decision is not really “final” if the plaintiff did not give the agency the “opportunity to exercise its ‘flexibility or discretion’ ” in reaching the decision.Id.,at –.Judge Bea dissented, explaining that the “ ‘finality’ ” requirement looks only to whether “ ‘the initial decisionmaker has arrived at a definitive position on the issue.’ ”Id.,at . In his view, an additional demand that plaintiffs “follo[w ] the decisionmaker’s administrative procedures” would “ris[k ] ‘establish[ing] an exhaustion requirement for § takings claims,’ something the law does not allow.”Ibid.And when the Ninth Circuit declined to rehear the case en banc, Judge Collins dissented along the same lines. He expressed concern that “the panel’s unprecedented decision sharply depart[ed] from settled law and directly contravene[d] . . .Knick” by “impos[ing] an impermissible exhaustion requirement.” F.3d , , ().IIWe, too, think that the Ninth Circuit’s view of finality is incorrect. The finality requirement is relatively modest. All a plaintiff must show is that “there [is] no question . . . about how the ‘regulations at issue apply to the particular land in question.’ ”Suitum, U. S., at (brackets omitted).In this case, there is no question about the city’s position: Petitioners must “execute the lifetime lease” or face an “enforcement action.” Brief for Respondents 9. And there is no question that the government’s “definitive position on the issue [has] inflict[ed] an actual, concrete injury” of requiring petitioners to choose between surrendering possession of their property or facing the wrath of the government.Williamson County, U. S., at .The rationales for the finality requirement underscore that nothing more thande factofinality is necessary. This requirement ensures that a plaintiff has actually “been injured by the Government’s action” and is not prematurely suing over a hypothetical harm.Horne, U. S., at . Along the same lines, because a plaintiff who asserts a regulatory taking must prove that the government “regulation has gone ‘too far,’ ” the court must first “kno[w ] how far the regulation goes.”MacDonald, Sommer & Fratesv.Yolo County, U.S. , (). Once the government is committed to a position, however, these potential ambiguities evaporate and the dispute is ripe for judicial resolution.The Ninth Circuit’s contrary approach—that a conclusive decision is not “final” unless the plaintiffalsocomplied with administrative processes in obtaining that decision—is inconsistent with the ordinary operation of civil-rights suits. Petitioners brought their takings claim under §, which “guarantees ‘a federal forum for claims of unconstitutional treatment at the hands of state officials.’ ”Knick, U. S., at 2). That guarantee includes “the settled rule” that “exhaustion of state remedies isnota prerequisite to an action under . . . §.”Ibid.(internal quotation marks omitted). In fact, one of the reasonsKnickgave for rejectingWilliamson County’s state-compensation requirement is that this rule had “effectively established an exhaustion requirement for § takings claims.”Knick, U. S., at ).The Ninth Circuit’s demand that a plaintiff seek “an exemption through the prescribed [state] procedures,” F. 3d, at , plainly requires exhaustion. In fact, this rule mirrors our administrative-exhaustion doctrine, which “provides that no one is entitled to judicial relief for a supposed or threatened injury until the prescribed administrative remedy has been exhausted.”Woodfordv.Ngo, U.S. , – () (internal quotation marks omitted). As we have often explained, this doctrine requires “properexhaustion”—that is, “compliance with an agency’s deadlines and other critical procedural rules.”Id.,at (emphasis added). Otherwise, parties who would “prefer to proceed directly to federal court” might fail to raise their grievances in a timely fashion and thus deprive “the agency [of] a fair and full opportunity to adjudicate their claims.”Id.,at –. Or, in the words of the Ninth Circuit below, parties might “make an end run . . . by sitting on their hands until every applicable deadline has expired before lodging a token exemption request that they know the relevant agency can no longer grant.” F. 3d, at .Whatever policy virtues this doctrine might have, administrative “exhaustion of state remedies” is not a prerequisite for a takings claim when the government has reached a conclusive position.Knick, U. S., at 2). To be sure, we have indicated that a plaintiff ’s failure to properly pursue administrative procedures may render a claim unripeifavenues still remain for the government to clarify or change its decision. See,e.g.,Williamson County, U. S., at – (“The Commission’s refusal to approve the preliminary plat . . . leaves open the possibility that [the plaintiff] may develop the subdivision according to the plat after obtaining the variances”);Knick, U. S., at 5) (“[T]he developer [inWilliamson County] still had an opportunity to seek a variance from the appeals board”); cf.Palazzolov.Rhode Island, U.S. , – () (dismissing accusations that the plaintiff was “employing a hide the ball strategy” when “submission of [a] proposal would not have clarified the extent of development permitted . . . , which is the inquiry required under our ripeness decisions”). But, contrary to the Ninth Circuit’s view, administrative missteps do not defeat ripeness once the government has adopted its final position. SeeWilliamson County, U. S., at – (distinguishing its “finality requirement” from traditional administrative “exhaust[ion]”). It may very well be, as Judge Bea observed, that misconduct during the administrative process is relevant to “evaluating themeritsof the . . . clai[m ]” or the measure of damages. F. 3d, at , n. 2 (dissenting opinion); cf.Palazzolo, U. S., at . For the limited purpose of ripeness, however, ordinary finality is sufficient.Of course, Congress always has the option of imposing a strict administrative-exhaustion requirement—just as it has done for certain civil-rights claims filed by prisoners. See U. S. C. §1997e(a);Ngo, U. S., at – (“Before , prisoners asserting constitutional claims had no obligation to exhaust administrative remedies”). But it has not done so for takings plaintiffs. Given that the Fifth Amendment enjoys “full-fledged constitutional status,” the Ninth Circuit had no basis to relegate petitioners’ claim “ ‘to the status of a poor relation’ among the provisions of the Bill of Rights.”Knick, U. S., at 6).* * *For the foregoing reasons, we grant the petition for a writ of certiorari, vacate the judgment of the Ninth Circuit, and remand the case for proceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.Notes1The Ninth Circuit rejected several of petitioners’ alternative theories on the merits. See,e.g., F.3d , , n. 4 () (considering whether “the Lifetime Lease Requirement effects an exaction, a physical taking, [or] a private taking”). On remand, the Ninth Circuit may give further consideration to these claims in light of our recent decision inCedar Point Nurseryv.Hassid,ante, p."}

Decided January 7, 2019Per Curiam.The question in this qualified immunity case is whether two police officers violated clearly established law when they forcibly apprehended a man at the scene of a reported domestic violence incident.The record, viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, shows the following. In April , Escondido police received a call from Maggie Emmons about a domestic violence incident at her apartment. Emmons lived at the apartment with her husband, her two children, and a roommate, Ametria Douglas. Officer Jake Houchin responded to the scene and eventually helped take a domestic violence report from Emmons about injuries caused by her husband. The officers arrested her husband. He was later released.A few weeks later, on May , , at about 2: p.m., Escondido police received a call about another possible domestic disturbance at Emmons’ apartment. That call came from Ametria Douglas’ mother, Trina Douglas. Trina Douglas was not at the apartment, but she was on the phone with her daughter Ametria, who was at the apartment. Trina heard her daughter Ametria and Maggie Emmons yelling at each other and heard her daughter screaming for help. The call then disconnected, and Trina Douglas called .Officer Houchin again responded, along with Officer Robert Craig. The dispatcher informed the officers that two children could be in the residence and that calls to the apartment had gone unanswered.Police body-camera video of the officers’ actions at the apartment is in the record.The officers knocked on the door of the apartment. No one answered. But a side window was open, and the officers spoke with Emmons through that window, attempting to convince her to open the door to the apartment so that they could conduct a welfare check. A man in the apartment also told Emmons to back away from the window, but the officers said they could not identify the man. At some point during this exchange, Sergeant Kevin Toth, Officer Joseph Leffingwell, and Officer Huy Quach arrived as backup.A few minutes later, a man opened the apartment door and came outside. At that point, Officer Craig was standing alone just outside the door. Officer Craig told the man not to close the door, but the man closed the door and tried to brush past Officer Craig. Officer Craig stopped the man, took him quickly to the ground, and handcuffed him. Officer Craig did not hit the man or display any weapon. The video shows that the man was not in any visible or audible pain as a result of the takedown or while on the ground. Within a few minutes, officers helped the man up and arrested him for a misdemeanor offense of resisting and delaying a police officer.The man turned out to be Maggie Emmons’ father, Marty Emmons. Marty Emmons later sued Officer Craig and Sergeant Toth, among others, under Rev. Stat. §, U. S. C. §. He raised several claims, including, as relevant here, a claim of excessive force in violation of the Fourth Amendment. The suit sought money damages for which Officer Craig and Sergeant Toth would be personally liable. The District Court held that the officers had probable cause to arrest Marty Emmons for the misdemeanor offense. The Ninth Circuit did not disturb that finding, and there is no claim presently before us that the officers lacked probable cause to arrest Marty Emmons. The only claim before us is that the officers used excessive force in effectuating the arrest.The District Court rejected the claim of excessive force. F. Supp. 3d , (SD Cal. ). The District Court stated that the “video shows that the officers acted professionally and respectfully in their encounter” at the apartment.Id., at . Because only Officer Craig used any force at all, the District Court granted summary judgment to Sergeant Toth on the excessive force claim.Applying this Court’s precedents on qualified immunity, the District Court also granted summary judgment to Officer Craig. According to the District Court, the law did not clearly establish that Officer Craig could not take down an arrestee in these circumstances. The court explained that the officers were responding to a domestic dispute, and that the encounter had escalated when the officers could not enter the apartment to conduct a welfare check. The District Court also noted that when Marty Emmons exited the apartment, none of the officers knew whether he was armed or dangerous, or whether he had injured any individuals inside the apartment.The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded for trial on the excessive force claims against both Officer Craig and Sergeant Toth. Fed. Appx. ( ). The Ninth Circuit’s entire relevant analysis of the qual- ified immunity question consisted of the following: “The right to be free of excessive force was clearly established at the time of the events in question.Gravelet-Blondinv.Shelton, F. 3d , (9th Cir. ).”Id., at .We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals as to Sergeant Toth, and vacate and remand as to Officer Craig.With respect to Sergeant Toth, the Ninth Circuit offered no explanation for its decision. The court’s unexplained reinstatement of the excessive force claim against Sergeant Toth was erroneous—and quite puzzling in light of the District Court’s conclusion that “only Defendant Craig was involved in the excessive force claim” and that Emmons “fail[ed] to identify contrary evidence.” F. Supp. 3d, at , n. 4.As to Officer Craig, the Ninth Circuit also erred. As we have explained many times: “Qualified immunity attaches when an official’s conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.”Kiselav.Hughes, U. S., at 4) (internal quotation marks omitted); seeDistrict of Columbiav.Wesby, U. S.Pauly, U. S.Luna, U. S.Under our cases, the clearly established right must be defined with specificity. “This Court has repeatedly told courts . . . not to define clearly established law at a high level of generality.”Kisela, U. S., at 4) (internal quotation marks omitted). That is particularly important in excessive force cases, as we have explained:“Specificity is especially important in the Fourth Amendment context, where the Court has recognized that it is sometimes difficult for an officer to determine how the relevant legal doctrine, here excessive force, will apply to the factual situation the officer confronts. Use of excessive force is an area of the law in which the result depends very much on the facts of each case, and thus police officers are entitled to qualified immunity unless existing precedent squarely governs the specific facts at issue. . . .“[I]t does not suffice for a court simply to state that an officer may not use unreasonable and excessive force, deny qualified immunity, and then remit the case for a trial on the question of reasonableness. An officer cannot be said to have violated a clearly established right unless the right’s contours were sufficiently definite that any reasonable official in the defendant’s shoes would have understood that he was violating it.”Id., at 5) (quotation altered).In this case, the Court of Appeals contravened those settled principles. The Court of Appeals should have asked whether clearly established law prohibited the officers from stopping and taking down a man in these circumstances. Instead, the Court of Appeals defined the clearly established right at a high level of generality by saying only that the “right to be free of excessive force” was clearly established. With the right defined at that high level of generality, the Court of Appeals then denied qualified immunity to the officers and remanded the case for trial. Fed. Appx., at .Under our precedents, the Court of Appeals’ formulation of the clearly established right was far too general. To be sure, the Court of Appeals cited theGravelet-Blondincase from that Circuit, which described a right to be “free from the application of non-trivial force for engaging in mere passive resistance. . . .” F. 3d, at . Assuming without deciding that a court of appeals decision may constitute clearly established law for purposes of qualified immunity, seeCity and County of San Franciscov.Sheehan, U. S. The Court of Appeals made no effort to explain how that case law prohibited Officer Craig’s actions in this case. That is a problem under our precedents:“[W]e have stressed the need to identify a case where an officer acting under similar circumstances was held to have violated the Fourth Amendment. . . . While there does not have to be a case directly on point, existing precedent must place the lawfulness of the particular [action] beyond debate. . . . Of course, there can be the rare obvious case, where the unlawfulness of the officer’s conduct is sufficiently clear even though existing precedent does not address similar circumstances. . . . But a body of relevant case law is usually necessary to clearly establish the answer . . . .”Wesby, U. S., at ) (internal quotation marks omitted).The Court of Appeals failed to properly analyze whether clearly established law barred Officer Craig from stopping and taking down Marty Emmons in this manner as Emmons exited the apartment. Therefore, we remand the case for the Court of Appeals to conduct the analysis required by our precedents with respect to whether Officer Craig is entitled to qualified immunity.The petition for certiorari is granted, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed in part and vacated in part, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered."}

They allege that they were fired by the city’s board of aldermen, not for deficient performance, but because they brought to light criminal activities of one of the aldermen. Charging violations of their Fourteenth Amendment due process rights, they sought compensatory relief from the city. Summary judgment was entered against them in the District Court, and affirmed on appeal, for failure to invoke U. S. C. § in their complaint.We summarily reverse. Federal pleading rules call for “a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief,” Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 8(a)(2); they do not countenance dismissal of a complaint for imperfect statement of the legal theory supporting the claim asserted. See Advisory Committee Report of October , reprinted in 12A C. Wright, A. Miller, M. Kane, R. Marcus, and A. Steinman, Federal Practice and Procedure, p. ( ed.) (Federal Rules of Civil Procedure “are designed to discourage battles over mere form of statement”); 5 C. Wright & A. Miller, §, p. (3d ed. ) (Rule 8(a)(2) “indicates that a basic objective of the rules is to avoid civil cases turning on technicalities”). In particular, no heightened pleading rule requires plaintiffs seeking damages for violations of constitutional rights to invoke § expressly in order to state a claim. SeeLeathermanv.Tarrant County Narcotics Intelligence and Coordination Unit, U.S. , () (a federal court may not apply a standard “more stringent than the usual pleading requirements of Rule 8(a)” in “civil rights cases alleging municipal liability”);Swierkiewiczv.Sorema N. A., U.S. , () (imposing a “height- ened pleading standard in employment discrimination cases conflicts with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2)”).The Fifth Circuit defended its requirement that complaints expressly invoke § as “not a mere pleading formality.” F.3d , () (internal quotation marks omitted). The requirement serves a notice function, the Fifth Circuit said, because “[c]ertain consequences flow from claims under §, such as the unavailability ofrespondeat superiorliability, which bears on the qualified immunity analysis.”Ibid.This statement displays some confusion in the Fifth Circuit’s perception of petitioners’ suit. No “qualified immunity analysis” is implicated here, as petitioners asserted a constitutional claim against the city only, not against any municipal officer. SeeOwenv.Independence, U.S. , () (a “municipality may not assert the good faith of its officers or agents as a defense to liability under §”).Our decisions inBell Atlantic Corp.v.Twombly, U.S. (), andAshcroftv.Iqbal, U.S. (), are not in point, for they concern thefactualallegations a complaint must contain to survive a motion to dismiss. A plaintiff, they instruct, must plead facts sufficient to show that her claim has substantive plausibility. Petitioners’ complaint was not deficient in that regard. Petitioners stated simply, concisely, and directly events that, they alleged, entitled them to damages from the city. Having informed the city of the factual basis for their complaint, they were required to do no more to stave off threshold dismissal for want of an adequate statement of their claim. See Fed. Rules Civ. Proc. 8(a)(2) and (3), (d)(1), (e). For clarification and to ward off further insistence on a punctiliously stated “theory of the pleadings,” petitioners, on remand, should be accorded an opportunity to add to their complaint a citation to §. See 5 Wright & Miller,supra, §, at – (“The federal rules effectively abolish the restrictive theory of the pleadings doctrine, making it clear that it is unnecessary to set out a legal theory for the plaintiff’s claim for relief.” (footnotes omitted)); Fed.

The application for a partial stay presented to [REDACTED] in No. and by him referred to the Court is denied.The Department of Education recently issued a new rule implementing Title IX of the Education Amendments of . The rule newly defined sex discrimination to “includ[e ] discrimination on the basis of sex stereotypes, sex characteristics, pregnancy or related conditions, sexual orientation, and gender identity.” Fed. Reg. ().Several States and other parties sought preliminary injunctions against the new rule, arguing among other things that the rule exceeded the bounds of the statutory text enacted by Congress. District Courts in Louisiana and Kentucky agreed with the plaintiffs and preliminarily enjoined enforcement of the rule in the plaintiff States. The Courts of Appeals for the Fifth and Sixth Circuits then declined to stay the injunctions in the interim period while those courts consider the Government’s appeals of the preliminary injunctions.The Government has now filed emergency applications in this Court seeking partial stays of the preliminary injunctions pending resolution of the appeals in the Fifth and Sixth Circuits. The Court denies the Government’s applications.Importantly, all Members of the Court today accept that the plaintiffs were entitled to preliminary injunctive relief as to three provisions of the rule, including the central provision that newly defines sex discrimination to include discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. But the Government argues (and the dissent agrees) that those provisions should be severed and that the other provisions of the new rule should still be permitted to take effect in the interim period while the Government’s appeals of the preliminary injunctions are pending in the Courts of Appeals. The lower courts concluded otherwise because the new definition of sex discrimination is intertwined with and affects many other provisions of the new rule. Those courts therefore concluded, at least at this preliminary stage, that the allegedly unlawful provisions are not readily severable from the remaining provisions. The lower courts also pointed out the difficulty that schools would face in determining how to apply the rule for a temporary period with some provisions in effect and some enjoined.In this emergency posture in this Court, the burden is on the Government as applicant to show, among other things, a likelihood of success on its severability argument and that the equities favor a stay. On this limited record and in its emergency applications, the Government has not provided this Court a sufficient basis to disturb the lower courts’ interim conclusions that the three provisions found likely to be unlawful are intertwined with and affect other provisions of the rule. Nor has the Government adequately identified which particular provisions, if any, are sufficiently independent of the enjoined definitional provision and thus might be able to remain in effect. Moreover, related to the equities, the Sixth Circuit has already expedited its consideration of the case and scheduled oral argument for October. The Court expects that the Courts of Appeals will render their decisions with appropriate dispatch. In light of all of the circumstances, the Court denies the Government’s applications for partial stays.It is so ordered."}

The parties negotiated a settlement agreement that would require Google to include certain disclosures on some of its webpages and would distribute more than $5 million tocy presrecipients, more than $2 million to class counsel, and no money to absent class members. We granted certiorari to review whether suchcy pressettlements satisfy the requirement that class settlements be “fair, reasonable, and adequate.” Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. (e)(2). Because there remain substantial questions about whether any of the named plaintiffs has standing to sue in light of our decision inSpokeo,Inc.v.Robins, U. S.Google operates an Internet search engine. The search engine allows users to search for a word or phrase by typing a query into the Google website. Google returns a list of webpages that are relevant to the indicated term or phrase. The complaints alleged that when an Internet user conducted a Google search and clicked on a hyperlink to open one of the webpages listed on the search results page, Google transmitted information including the terms of the search to the server that hosted the selected webpage. This so-called referrer header told the server that the user arrived at the webpage by searching for particular terms on Google’s website.Paloma Gaos challenged Google’s use of referrer headers. She filed a complaint in Federal District Court on behalf of herself and a putative class of people who conducted a Google search and clicked on any of the resulting links within a certain time period. Gaos alleged that Google’s transmission of users’ search terms in referrer headers violated the Stored Communications Act, U. S. C. §2701et seq.The SCA prohibits “a person or entity providing an electronic communication service to the public” from “knowingly divulg[ing] to any person or entity the contents of a communication while in electronic storage by that service.” §(a)(1). The Act also creates a private right of action that entitles any “person aggrieved by any violation” to “recover from the person or entity, other than the United States, which engaged in that violation such relief as may be appropriate.” §(a). Gaos also asserted several state law claims.Google moved to dismiss for lack of standing three times. Its first attempt was successful. The District Court reasoned that although “a plaintiff may establish standing through allegations of violation of a statutory right,” Gaos had “failed to plead facts sufficient to support a claim for violation of her statutory rights.”Gaosv.Google,Inc., WL , *3 (ND Cal., Apr. 7, ). In particular, the court faulted Gaos for failing to plead “that she clicked on a link from the Google search page.”Ibid.After Gaos filed an amended complaint, Google again moved to dismiss. That second attempt was partially successful. The District Court dismissed Gaos’ state law claims, but denied the motion as to her SCA claims. The court reasoned that because the SCA created a right to be free from the unlawful disclosure of certain communications, and because Gaos alleged a violation of the SCA that was specific to her (i.e., based on a search she conducted), Gaos alleged a concrete and particularized injury.Gaosv.Google Inc., WL , *4 (ND Cal., Mar. , ). The court rested that conclusion onEdwardsv.First American Corp., F.3d ()—a Ninth Circuit decision reasoning that an Article III injury exists whenever a statute gives an individual a statutory cause of action and the plaintiff claims that the defendant violated the statute. WL , *3.After the District Court ruled on Google’s second motion to dismiss, we granted certiorari inEdwardsto address whether an alleged statutory violation alone can support standing.First American Financial Corp.v.Edwards, U.S. (). In the meantime, Gaos and an additional named plaintiff filed a second amended complaint against Google. Google once again moved to dismiss. Google argued that the named plaintiffs did not have standing to bring their SCA claims because they had failed to allege facts establishing a cognizable injury. Google recognized that the District Court had previously relied onEdwardsto find standing based on the alleged violation of a statutory right. But because this Court had agreed to reviewEdwards, Google explained that it would continue to challenge the District Court’s conclusion. We eventually dismissedEdwardsas improvidently granted, U.S. () (per curiam), and Google then withdrew its argument that Gaos lacked standing for the SCA claims.Gaos’ putative class action was consolidated with a similar complaint, and the parties negotiated a classwide settlement. The terms of their agreement required Google to include certain disclosures about referrer headers on three of its webpages. Google could, however, continue its practice of transmitting users’ search terms in referrer headers. Google also agreed to pay $8.5 million. None of those funds would be distributed to absent class members. Instead, most of the money would be distributed to sixcy presrecipients. In the class action context,cy presrefers to the practice of distributing settlement funds not amenable to individual claims or meaningful pro rata distribution to nonprofit organizations whose work is determined to indirectly benefit class members. Black’s Law Dictionary (10th ed. ). In this case, thecy presrecipients were selected by class counsel and Google to “promote public awareness and education, and/or to support research, development, and initiatives, related to protecting privacy on the Internet.” App. to Pet. for Cert. . The rest of the funds would be used for administrative costs and fees, given to the named plaintiffs in the form of incentive payments, and awarded to class counsel as attorney’s fees.The District Court granted preliminary certification of the class and preliminary approval of the settlement. Five class members, including petitioners Theodore Frank and Melissa Holyoak, objected to the settlement on several grounds. They complained that settlements providing onlycy presrelief do not comply with the requirements of Rule (e), thatcy presrelief was not justified in this case, and that conflicts of interest infected the selection of thecy presrecipients. After a hearing, the District Court granted final approval of the settlement.Frank and Holyoak appealed. After briefing before the Ninth Circuit was complete, but prior to decision by that court, we issued our opinion inSpokeo,Inc.v.Robins, U. S. InSpokeo, we held that “Article III standing requires a concrete injury even in the context of a statutory violation.”Id., at 9). We rejected the premise, relied on in the decision then under review and inEdwards, that “a plaintiff automatically satisfies the injury-in-fact requirement whenever a statute grants a person a statutory right and purports to authorize that person to sue to vindicate that right.” U.

We granted certiorari, U. S.” Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. (e)(2).In briefing on the merits before this Court, the Solicitor General filed a brief asamicus curiaesupporting neither party. He urged us to vacate and remand the case for the lower courts to address standing. The Government argued that there is a substantial open question about whether any named plaintiff in the class action actually had standing in the District Court. Because Google withdrew its standing challenge after we dismissedEdwardsas improvidently granted, neither the District Court nor the Ninth Circuit ever opined on whether any named plaintiff sufficiently alleged standing in the operative complaint.“We have an obligation to assure ourselves of litigants’ standing under Article III.”DaimlerChrysler Corp.v.Cuno, U.S. , () (quotingFriends of the Earth,Inc.v.Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC),Inc., U.S. , (); internal quotation marks omitted). That obligation extends to court approval of proposed class action settlements. In ordinary non-class litigation, parties are free to settle their disputes on their own terms, and plaintiffs may voluntarily dismiss their claims without a court order. Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. (a)(1)(A). By contrast, in a class action, the “claims, issues, or defenses of a certified class—or a class proposed to be certified for purposes of settlement—may be settled, voluntarily dismissed, or compromised only with the court’s approval.” Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. (e). A court is powerless to approve a proposed class settlement if it lacks jurisdiction over the dispute, and federal courts lack jurisdiction if no named plaintiff has standing.Simonv.Eastern Ky. Welfare Rights Organization, U.S. , , n. ().When the District Court ruled on Google’s second motion to dismiss, it relied onEdwardsto hold that Gaos had standing to assert a claim under the SCA. Our decision inSpokeoabrogated the ruling inEdwardsthat the violation of a statutory right automatically satisfies the injury-in-fact requirement whenever a statute authorizes a person to sue to vindicate that right. U. S., at 9); seeEdwards, F. 3d, at –. Since that time, no court in this case has analyzed whether any named plaintiff has alleged SCA violations that are sufficiently concrete and particularized to support standing. After oral argument, we ordered supplemental briefing from the parties and Solicitor General to address that question.After reviewing the supplemental briefs, we conclude that the case should be remanded for the courts below to address the plaintiffs’ standing in light ofSpokeo. The supplemental briefs filed in response to our order raise a wide variety of legal and factual issues not addressed in the merits briefing before us or at oral argument. We “are a court of review, not of first view.”Cutterv.Wilkinson, U.S. , , n. 7 (). Resolution of the standing question should take place in the District Court or the Ninth Circuit in the first instance. We therefore vacate and remand for further proceedings.

Decided June , 2012Per Curiam.In this habeas case, the United States Court of Ap- peals for the Sixth Circuit set aside two -year-old murder convictions based on the flimsiest of rationales. The court’s decision is a textbook example of what the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of (AEDPA) proscribes: “using federal habeas corpus review as a vehicle to second-guess the reasonable decisions of state courts.”Renicov.Lett, U. S., at ). We therefore grant the petition for certiorari and reverse.IBetween 1 and 2 a.m. on the morning of June , , respondent David Eugene Matthews broke into the Louisville home he had until recently shared with his estranged wife, Mary Marlene Matthews (Marlene). At the time, Matthews’ mother-in-law, Magdalene Cruse, was staying at the home with her daughter. Matthews found Cruse in bed and shot her in the head at point-blank range, using a gun he had purchased with borrowed funds hours before. Matthews left Cruse there mortally wounded and went into the next room, where he found his wife. He had sexual relations with her once or twice; stayed with her until about 6 a.m.; and then shot her twice, killing her. Cruse would die from her wound later that day.Matthews was apprehended that morning at his mother’s house, where he had already begun to wash the clothes he wore during the crime. Later in the day, police officers found the murder weapon secreted below the floorboards of a backyard shed on the property. At the police station, Matthews made a tape-recorded statement to a police detective in which he denied responsibility for the murders.A grand jury indicted Matthews for the two murders and for burglary. At trial, he did not contest that he killed the two victims. Instead, he sought to show that he had acted under “extreme emotional disturbance,” which under Kentucky law serves to reduce a homicide that would otherwise be murder to first-degree manslaughter. Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. §§.(1)(a), .(1)(b) (West ). As support for that claim, Matthews pointed to the troubled history of his marriage with Marlene. Matthews and his wife had been frequently separated from one another, and their periods of separation were marked by extreme hostility. Marlene would regularly procure criminal warrants against Matthews; several weeks before the murders she obtained one charging Matthews with sexual abuse of Marlene’s 6-year-old daughter, which had led to Matthews’ spending roughly three weeks in jail. Witnesses also testified that Marlene sought to control Matthews when they were together and would yell at him from across the street when they were separated; and Matthews’ mother recounted that Marlene would leave the couple’s young child crying in the street late at night outside the house where Matthews was sleeping in order to antagonize him.Matthews also introduced the testimony of a psychiatrist, Dr. Lee Chutkow, who had evaluated Matthews. Dr. Chutkow related what Matthews had told him about the murders, including that Matthews had been drinking heav- ily and taking Valium and a stimulant drug. Dr. Chut- kow testified that he had diagnosed Matthews as suf- fering from an adjustment disorder, which he described as a “temporary emotional and behavioral disturbance in individuals who are subject to a variety of stresses,” that would temporarily impair a person’s judgment and cause symptoms such as “anxiety, nervousness, depression, even suicide attempts or attempts to hurt other people.” 6 Record . Dr. Chutkow testified to his opinion that Matthews was acting under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance at the time of the murders—in particular, that he experienced “extreme tension, irritability, and almost a kind of fear of his late wife,”id.,at , whom he perceived as having tormented and emasculated him.The jury convicted Matthews on all charges, and he was sentenced to death. The Kentucky Supreme Court affirmed the convictions and sentence, rejecting Matthews’ claims of error.Matthewsv.Commonwealth, S.W.2d , (). In response to Matthews’ argument that the evidence was insufficient to establish that he had acted in the absence of extreme emotional disturbance, the court concluded that the evidence regarding Matthews’ “conduct before, during and after the offense was more than sufficient to support the jury’s findings of capital murder.”Id.,at . A claim that the prosecutor had committed misconduct during his closing argument was rejected on the merits, but without discussion.Following an unsuccessful state postconviction proceeding, Matthews filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under U. S. C. § in the United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky. Matthews contended, among other things, that the Kentucky Supreme Court had contravened clearly established federal law in rejecting his claim that the evidence was insufficient to prove that he had not acted under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance and in rejecting his claim of prosecutorial misconduct. The District Court dismissed the petition, but a divided panel of the Sixth Circuit reversed with instructions to grant relief. F.3d ().IIUnder AEDPA, the Sixth Circuit had no authority to issue the writ of habeas corpus unless the Kentucky Supreme Court’s decision “was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,” or “was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.” U. S. C. §(d). The Sixth Circuit gave two grounds for its conclusion that Matthews was entitled to relief under this “difficult to meet . . . and highly deferential standard,”Cullenv.Pinholster, U. S., at 9) (internal quotation marks omitted). Neither is valid.AFirst, the Sixth Circuit held that the Kentucky Supreme Court had impermissibly shifted to Matthews the burden of proving extreme emotional disturbance, and that the Commonwealth had failed to prove the absence of extreme emotional disturbance beyond a reasonable doubt. The Sixth Circuit reasoned that, at the time Matthews committed his offenses, the allocation of the burden of proof on extreme emotional disturbance was governed by the Kentucky Supreme Court’s decision inGallv.Commonwealth, S.W.2d , (), which placed the burden of producing evidence on the defendant, but left the bur- den of proving the absence of extreme emotional disturbance with the Commonwealth in those cases in which the defendant had introduced evidence sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt on the issue. According to the Sixth Circuit, however, the Kentucky Supreme Court departed from that understanding in Matthews’ case and placed the burden of proving extreme emotional disturbance “entirely on the defendant,” F. 3d, at .The Sixth Circuit’s interpretation is supported by certain aspects of the Kentucky Supreme Court’s opinion in Matthews’ case. For example, the state court indicated that Matthews had “present[ed] extensive evidence” of his extreme emotional disturbance, yet the court rejected his sufficiency-of-the-evidence claim by finding the evidence he had presented “far from overwhelming,” rather than by stating that it failed to raise a reasonable doubt.Matthews, S. W. 2d, at –. The state court also observed that it had recently clarified inWellmanv.Com- monwealth, S.W.2d (), that “absence of extreme emotional disturbance is not an element of the crime of murder which the Commonwealth must affirmatively prove.”Matthews,supra, at . In the Sixth Circuit’s view, the Kentucky Supreme Court’s reliance on thisWellmanformulation of extreme emotional disturbance in resolving Matthews’ appeal violated the Due Process Clause, as construed by this Court inBouiev.City of Columbia, U.S. , (), because it involved the retroactive application of an “ ‘unexpected and indefensible’ ” judicial revision of the Kentucky murder statute.The Kentucky Supreme Court’s initial assessment of the evidence and reliance uponWellmanwould be relevant if they formed the sole basis for denial of Matthews’ sufficiency-of-the-evidence claim. It is not clear, however, that they did. The Kentucky Supreme Court explained that “[t]he trial court’s instructions in regard to extreme emotional disturbance were adequate, and the proof supported the jury’s findings of intentional murder.” S. W. 2d, at . Those jury instructions required the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that Matthews had not acted “under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance for which there was a reasonable justification or excuse under the circumstances as he believed them to be.” 6 Record , –. The case had been submitted to the jury with the burden assigned to the Commonwealth, the jury had found that burden carried, and the Kentucky Supreme Court found the evidence adequate to sustain that finding. That ground was sufficient to reject Matthews’ claim, so it is irrelevant that the court also invoked a ground of questionable validity. SeeWetzelv.Lambert, U. S., at 4–5).[1]The Sixth Circuit’s opinion also challenges the conclusion that the evidence supported a finding of no extreme emotional disturbance. We have said that “it is the responsibility of the jury—not the court—to decide what conclusions should be drawn from evidence admitted at trial,”Cavazosv.Smith, U.S., at 1). The evidence is sufficient to support a conviction whenever, “after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution,anyrational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.”Jacksonv.Virginia, U.S. , (). And a state-court decision rejecting a sufficiency challenge may not be overturned on federal habeas unless the “decision was ‘objectively unreasonable., at 1).In light of this twice-deferential standard, it is abundantly clear that the Kentucky Supreme Court’s rejection of Matthews’ sufficiency claim is controlling in this federal habeas proceeding. The Sixth Circuit noted that Dr. Chutkow expressed an opinion that Matthews was under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance at the time of the murders, and did not retreat from that opinion on cross-examination. But there was ample evidence pointing in the other direction as well. As the Kentucky Supreme Court observed, Matthews’ claim of extreme emo- tional disturbance was belied by “the circumstances of the crime,” S. W. 2d, at —including the facts that he borrowed money to purchase the murder weapon the day of the murders, that he waited several hours after buying the gun before starting for his wife’s home, and that he delayed several hours between shooting his mother-in-law and killing his wife. The claim was also belied by his behavior after the murders, including his “[taking] steps to hide the gun and clean his clothes,” and later “giv[ing] a false statement to the police.”Ibid.The Sixth Circuit discounted this evidence because Dr. Chutkow testified that Matthews’ deliberateness and consciousness of wrongdoing were not inconsistent with the diagnosis of extreme emotional disturbance. F. 3d., at , n. 4. But expert testimony does not trigger a conclusive presumption of correctness, and it was not unreasonable to conclude thatthe jurorswere entitled to consider the tension between Dr. Chutkow’s testimony and their own common-sense understanding of emotional disturbance. In resolving the conflict in favor of Dr. Chutkow’s testi- mony, the Sixth Circuit overstepped the proper limits of its authority. SeeJackson,supra,at .More fundamentally, the Sixth Circuit did not appear to consider the possibility that the jury could have found the symptoms described by Dr. Chutkow inadequate to establish what is required to reduce murder to manslaughter under Kentucky law: that Matthews “acted under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance for which there was a reasonable explanation or excuse, the reasonableness of which is to be determined from the viewpoint of a person in the defendant’s situation under the circumstances as the defendant believed them to be.” Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. §.(1)(a). Dr. Chutkow himself agreed that many people face tension and anxiety—two symptoms he attributed to Matthews. 6 Record –. And he agreed that many people suffer from adjustment disorders.Id.,at . But of course very few people commit murders. In light of these points, which bear on the proper characterization of Matthews’ mental condition and the reasonableness of his conduct, the Kentucky Supreme Court made no objectively unreasonable error in concluding that the question of extreme emotional disturbance was properly committed to the jury for resolution.BAs a second ground for its decision, the Sixth Circuit held that certain remarks made by the prosecutor during his closing argument constituted a denial of due process. This claim was rejected on the merits by the Kentucky Supreme Court (albeit without analysis) and therefore receives deferential review under the AEDPA standard. SeeHarringtonv.Richter, U. S., at 8). The “clearly established Federal law” relevant here is our decision inDardenv.Wainwright, U.S. (), which explained that a prosecutor’s improper comments will be held to violate the Constitution only if they “ ‘so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.’ ”Id.,at (quotingDonnellyv.DeChristoforo, U.S. , ()).According to the Sixth Circuit, the prosecutor violatedDardenby suggesting that Matthews had colluded with his lawyer, David Busse, and with Dr. Chutkow to manufacture an extreme emotional disturbance defense. But although the Sixth Circuit quoted a lengthy section of the prosecutor’s closing argument which could be understood as raising a charge of collusion,[2] the court did not address the prosecutor’s statement that immediately followed the quoted portion and expressly disavowed any suggestion of collusion:“And that’s not to say that Mr. Busse is unethical. Not at all. He is entitled to the best defense he can get, but that’s the only defense he has, what the doctor has to say, and that’s not to say that the doctor gets on the stand and perjures himself. He’s telling you the truth. He wouldn’t perjure himself for anything. He’s telling you the truth, Ladies and Gentlemen.” 7 Record .With the prosecutor’s immediate clarification that he wasnotalleging collusion in view, the Sixth Circuit’s conclusion that this feature of the closing argument clearly violated due process is unsupportable. Nor does the prosecutor’s suggestion that Matthews had “enhance[d] his story to Doctor Chutkow,”ibid.,suffice to justify the Sixth Circuit’s grant of habeas relief. In context, that statement is clearly a part of a broader argument that Matthews had a motive to exaggerate his emotional disturbance in his meetings with Dr. Chutkow. Shortly after the quoted statement, the prosecutor continued with a series of rhetorical questions:“Don’t you think he would exaggerate his fears about his wife, his mother-in-law, and all these other things about what other people might be doing to his mother? Don’t you think he would overstate the extent of his intoxication to his psychiatrist?”Ibid.The Sixth Circuit cited no precedent of this Court in support of its conclusion that due process prohibits a prosecutor from emphasizing a criminal defendant’s motive to exaggerate exculpatory facts.The Sixth Circuit also suggested that the prosecutor “denigrated the [extreme emotional disturbance] defense itself,” F. 3d, at , by stating that “[i]t’s the defense of last resort, Ladies and Gentlemen. He has no excuse for his conduct, but that’s his only way out.” 7 Record . But the Kentucky Supreme Court could have understood this comment too as having been directed at Matthews’ motive to exaggerate his emotional disturbance—i.e.,as emphasizing that the unavailability of any other defense raised the stakes with respect to extreme emotional disturbance.Moreover, even if the comment is understood as directing the jury’s attention to inappropriate considerations, that would not establish that the Kentucky Supreme Court’s rejection of theDardenprosecutorial misconduct claim “was so lacking in justification that there was an error well understood and comprehended in existing law beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.”Harrington, U. S., at ). Indeed,Dardenitself held that a closing argument considerably more inflammatory than the one at issue here did not warrant habeas relief. See U. S., at , n. (prosecutor referred to the defendant as an “ ‘animal’ ”);id.,at , n. (“ ‘I wish I could see [the defendant] with no face, blown away by a shotgun’ ”). Particularly because theDardenstandard is a very general one, leaving courts “more leeway . . . in reaching outcomes in case-by-case determinations,”Yarboroughv.Alvarado, U.S. , ()), the Sixth Circuit had no warrant to set aside the Kentucky Supreme Court’s conclusion.The Sixth Circuit also erred by consulting its own precedents, rather than those of this Court, in assessing the reasonableness of the Kentucky Supreme Court’s decision. After quoting the governing standard from our decision inDarden, the Sixth Circuit added that it would “engag[e] in a two step inquiry to determine whether the prosecutorial misconduct rises to the level of unconstitutionality. ‘To satisfy the standard . . . , the conduct must be both improper and flagrant.’ ” F. 3d, at (quotingBroomv.Mitchell, F.3d , ( )). It went on to evaluate the flagrancy step of that inquiry in light of four factors derived from its own precedent: “ ‘(1) the likelihood that the remarks . . . tended to mislead the jury or prejudice the defendant; (2) whether the remarks were isolated or extensive; (3) whether the remarks were deliberately or accidentally made; and (4) the total strength of the evidence against [Matthews].’ ” F. 3d, at (quotingBroom,supra,at ). And it stated that “the prosecutor’s comments in this case were sufficiently similar to” certain comments held unconstitutional in its prior decision inGallII, F.3d ( ), “that they rise to the level of impropriety.” F. 3d, at .As we explained in correcting an identical error by the Sixth Circuit two Terms ago, seeRenico, U. S., at –), circuit precedent does not constitute “clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court,” U. S. C. §(d)(1). It therefore cannot form the basis for habeas relief under AEDPA. Nor can the Sixth Circuit’s reliance on its own precedents be defended in this case on the ground that they merely reflect what has been “clearly established” by our cases. The highly generalized standard for evaluating claims of prosecutorial misconduct set forth inDardenbears scant resemblance to the elaborate, multistep test employed by the Sixth Circuit here. To make matters worse, the Sixth Circuit decidedGall IIunder pre-AEDPA law, see F. 3d, at , n. 2, so that case did not evenpurportto reflect clearly established law as set out in this Court’s holdings. It was plain and repetitive error for the Sixth Circuit to rely on its own precedents in granting Matthews habeas relief.* * *The petition for a writ of certiorari and respondent’s motion to proceedin forma pauperisare granted. The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.Notes1An ambiguously worded footnote in the Sixth Circuit’s opinion, see F.3d , , n. 5 (), suggests that the court may have found an additional due process violation. The court referred to a statement in the Kentucky Supreme Court’s decision inGallv. S.W.2d , (), that “[u]nless the evidence raising the issue [of extreme emotional disturbance] is of such probative force that otherwise the defendant would be entitled as a matter of law to an acquittal on the higher charge (murder), the prosecution is not required to come forth with negating evidence in order to sustain its burden of proof.” Relying on its own opinion in Gall’s federal habeas proceeding,Gallv.Parker, F.3d ( )(Gall II),the Sixth Circuit suggested that the quoted statement “require[d] a defendant to bear the heavy burden of disproving an element of a crime beyond a reasonable doubt,” F. 3d, at , n. 5, in violation of this Court’s decision inMullaneyv.Wilbur, U.S. (). That is not so. The statement explicitly acknowledges that the burden of proof rests with the prosecution, but merely asserts that when the burden of production is assigned to the defendant the jury may find the prosecution’s burden of proof satisfied without introduction of negating evidence, unless the defendant’s evidence is so probative as to establish reasonable doubt as a matter of law. That seems to us a truism. See 2 J. Strong, McCormick on Evidence §, pp. – (5th ed. ). Our opinion inMullaneyaddressed a situation in which the burden of persuasionwasshifted to the defendant, see U. S., at , and n. ; it does not remotely show that the Kentucky Supreme Court’s truism contravened clearly established federal law.2The full text of the section the Sixth Circuit found objectionable is as follows: “He’s arraigned, he meets with his attorney and either he tells his at-torney, I did it or I didn’t do it. One or the other. But, the attorney knows what the evidence is. By the way, the defendant knows what the evidence is, because while he’s giving this statement, it’s sitting right in front of him at the Homicide Office. Here’s the gun. Here’s the shoes, David. ‘Nah, nah, I never saw it before. I never borrowed a gun. I never borrowed any money. I wasn’t there. I was at home in bed asleep.’ He’s denying it there. “And what does his attorney think? His attorney sees all this evidence, and he’s going through his mind, what kind of legal excuse canI have? What is this man’s defense? Self protection? No, there’s no proof of a gun found at that house on North 24th Street. No proof of that. Protection of another? The defendant’s mother is at home on Lytle Street. He isn’t protecting her over there on North 24th Street. Intoxication? Yeah, well, he was drinking that night. Maybe that will mean something. “But that isn’t enough, Ladies and Gentlemen. Mr. Busse has to contact a psychiatrist to see his client, and he comes in and sees his client one month after the day of his arrest, one month to the day, and by that time, Mr. David Eugene Matthews sees his defense in the form of Doctor Chutkow, and do you think this guy is aware of what’s going on? He’s competent. He can work with his attorney, and he enhances his story to Doctor Chutkow. Yeah, I was drinking. I was drinking a lot. I was taking a lot of pills, too, and let me tell you about the pills I was taking. “Don’t you think he has a purpose in enhancing his story to the psychiatrist? Don’t you think he would exaggerate his fears about his wife, his mother-in-law, and all these other things about what other people might be doing to his mother? Don’t you think he would overstate the extent of his intoxication to his psychiatrist? It’s the defense of last resort, Ladies and Gentlemen. He has no excuse for his conduct, but that’s his only way out.” 7 Record –."}

Decided November 7, 2011Per Curiam.Agreements to arbitrate that fall within the scope and coverage of the Federal Arbitration Act (Act), 9 U. S. C. §1 et seq., must be enforced in state and federal courts. State courts, then, “have a prominent role to play as enforcers of agreements to arbitrate.” Vaden v. Discover Bank, U.S. , ().The Act has been interpreted to require that if a dispute presents multiple claims, some arbitrable and some not, the former must be sent to arbitration even if this will lead to piecemeal litigation. See Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. v. Byrd, U.S. , (). From this it follows that state and federal courts must examine with care the complaints seeking to invoke their jurisdiction in order to separate arbitrable from nonarbitrable claims. A court may not issue a blanket refusal to compel arbitration merely on the grounds that some of the claims could be resolved by the court without arbitration. See ibid.In this case the Fourth District Court of Appeal of the State of Florida upheld a trial court’s refusal to compel arbitration of respondents’ claims after determining that two of the four claims in a complaint were nonarbitrable. Though the matter is not altogether free from doubt, a fair reading of the opinion indicates a likelihood that the Court of Appeal failed to determine whether the other two claims in the complaint were arbitrable. For this reason, the judgment of the Court of Appeal is vacated, and the case remanded for further proceedings.* * *Respondents are individuals and entities who bought limited partnership interests in one of three limited partnerships, all known as the Rye Funds. The Rye Funds were managed by Tremont Group Holding, Inc., and Tremont Partners, Inc., both of which were audited by KPMG. The Rye Funds were invested with financier Bernard Madoff and allegedly lost millions of dollars as a result of a scheme to defraud. Respondents sued the Rye Funds, the Tremont defendants, and Tremont’s auditing firm, KPMG.Only the claims against KPMG are at issue in this case. Against KPMG, respondents alleged four causes of action: negligent misrepresentation; violation of the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act (FDUTPA), Fla. Stat. . et seq. (); professional malpractice; and aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty. Respondents’ basic theory was that KPMG failed to use proper auditing standards with respect to the financial statements of the partnerships. These improper audits, respondents contend, led to “substantial misrepresentations” about the health of the funds and resulted in respondents’ investment losses. So. 3d , (Fla. App. ).KPMG moved to compel arbitration based on the audit services agreement that existed between it and the Tremont defendants. That agreement provided that “[a]ny dispute or claim arising out of or relating to . . . the services provided [by KPMG] . . . (including any dispute or claim involving any person or entity for whose benefit the services in question are or were provided) shall be resolved” either by mediation or arbitration. App. to Pet. for Cert. 63a. The Florida Circuit Court of the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit Palm Beach County denied the motion.The Court of Appeal affirmed, noting that “[n]one of the plaintiffs . . . expressly assented in any fashion to [the audit services agreement] or the arbitration provision.” So. 3d, at . Thus, the court found, the arbitration clause could only be enforced if respondents’ claims were derivative in that they arose from the services KPMG performed for the Tremont defendants pursuant to the audit services agreement. Applying Delaware law, which both parties agreed was applicable, the Court of Appeal concluded that the negligent misrepresentation and the violation of FDUTPA claims were direct rather than derivative. A fair reading of the opinion reveals nothing to suggest that the court came to the same conclusion about the professional malpractice and breach of fiduciary duty claims. Indeed, the court said nothing about those claims at all. Finding “the arbitral agreement upon which KPMG relied would not apply to the direct claims made by the individual plaintiffs,” id., at , the Court of Appeal affirmed the trial court’s denial of the motion to arbitrate.Respondents have since amended their complaint to add a fifth claim. Citing the Court of Appeal’s decision, the trial court again denied KPMG’s motion to compel arbitration.The Federal Arbitration Act reflects an “emphatic fed- eral policy in favor of arbitral dispute resolution.” Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., U.S. , (); Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury Constr. Corp., U.S. 1, – () (noting that “questions of arbitrability [must]. . . be addressed with a healthy regard for the federal policy favoring arbitration”). This policy, as contained within the Act, “requires courts to enforce the bargain of the parties to arbitrate,” Dean Witter, supra, at , and “cannot possibly require the disregard of state law permitting arbitration by or against nonparties to the written arbitration agreement,” Arthur Andersen LLP v. Carlisle, U.S. , , n. 5 () (emphasis deleted). Both parties agree that whether the claims in the complaint are arbitrable turns on the question whether they must be deemed direct or derivative under Delaware law. That question of state law is not at issue here. What is at issue is the Court of Appeal’s apparent refusal to compel arbitration on any of the four claims based solely on a finding that two of them, the claim of negligent misrepresentation and the alleged violation of the FDUTPA, were nonarbitrable.In Dean Witter, the Court noted that the Act “provides that written agreements to arbitrate controversies arising out of an existing contract ‘shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.’ ” U. S., at (quoting 9 U. S. C. §2). The Court found that by its terms, “the Act leaves no place for the exercise of discretion by a district court, but instead mandates that district courts shall direct the parties to proceed to arbitration on issues as to which an arbitration agreement has been signed.” U. S., at (emphasis in original). Thus, when a complaint contains both arbitrable and nonarbitrable claims, the Act requires courts to “compel arbitration of pendent arbitrable claims when one of the parties files a motion to compel, even where the result would be the possibly inefficient maintenance of separate proceedings in different forums.” Id., at . To implement this holding, courts must examine a complaint with care to assess whether any individual claim must be arbitrated. The failure to do so is subject to immediate review. See Southland Corp. v. Keating, U.S. 1, 6–7 ().The Court of Appeal listed all four claims, found that two were direct, and then refused to compel arbitration on the complaint as a whole because the arbitral agreement “would not apply to the direct claims.” So. 3d, at . By not addressing the other two claims in the complaint, the Court of Appeal failed to give effect to the plain meaning of the Act and to the holding of Dean Witter. The petition for certiorari is granted. The judgment of the Court of Appeal is vacated, and the case is remanded. On remand, the Court of Appeal should examine the re- maining two claims to determine whether either requires arbitration.It is so ordered."}

Federal regulations require petitioners to cover certain contraceptives as part of their health plans, unless petitioners submit a form either to their insurer or to the Federal Government, stating that they object on religious grounds to providing contraceptive coverage. Petitioners allege that submitting this notice substantially burdens the exercise of their religion, in violation of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of , 107Stat. , U. S. C. §2000bbet seq.Following oral argument, the Court requested supplemental briefing from the parties addressing “whether contraceptive coverage could be provided to petitioners’ employees, through petitioners’ insurance companies, without any such notice from petitioners.”Post, p.Both petitioners and the Government now confirm that such an option is feasible. Petitioners have clarified that their religious exercise is not infringed where they “need to do nothing more than contract for a plan that does not include coverage for some or all forms of contraception,” even if their employees receive cost-free contraceptive coverage from the same insurance company. Supplemental Brief for Petitioners 4. The Government has confirmed that the challenged procedures “for employers with insured plans could be modified to operate in the manner posited in the Court’s order while still ensuring that the affected women receive contraceptive coverage seamlessly, together with the rest of their health coverage.” Supplemental Brief for Respondents –.In light of the positions asserted by the parties in their supplemental briefs, the Court vacates the judgments below and remands to the respective United States Courts of Appeals for the Third, Fifth, Tenth, and D. C. Circuits. Given the gravity of the dispute and the substantial clarification and refinement in the positions of the parties, the parties on remand should be afforded an opportunity to arrive at an approach going forward that accommodates petitioners’ religious exercise while at the same time ensuring that women covered by petitioners’ health plans “receive full and equal health coverage, including contraceptive coverage.”Id., at 1. We anticipate that the Courts of Appeals will allow the parties sufficient time to resolve any outstanding issues between them.The Court finds the foregoing approach more suitable than addressing the significantly clarified views of the parties in the first instance. Although there may still be areas of disagreement between the parties on issues of implementation, the importance of those areas of potential concern is uncertain, as is the necessity of this Court’s involvement at this point to resolve them. This Court has taken similar action in other cases in the past. See,e.g., Madison Countyv.Oneida Indian Nation of N. Y., U. S. , () (per curiam) (vacating and remanding for the Second Circuit to “address, in the first instance, whether to revisit its ruling on sovereign immunity in light of [a] new factual development, and—if necessary—proceed to address other questions in the case consistent with its sovereign immunity ruling”);Kiyembav.Obama, U.

Circuit to “determine, in the first instance, what further proceedings in that court or in the District Court are necessary and appropriate for the full and prompt disposition of the case in light of the new developments”);Villarrealv.United States, U. S.The Court expresses no view on the merits of the cases. In particular, the Court does not decide whether petitioners’ religious exercise has been substantially burdened, whether the Government has a compelling interest, or whether the current regulations are the least restrictive means of serving that interest.Nothing in this opinion, or in the opinions or orders of the courts below, is to affect the ability of the Government to ensure that women covered by petitioners’ health plans “obtain, without cost, the full range of FDA approved contraceptives.”Wheaton Collegev.Burwell, U. S., at 1). Through this litigation, petitioners have made the Government aware of their view that they meet “the requirements for exemption from the contraceptive coverage requirement on religious grounds.”Id., at 2). Nothing in this opinion, or in the opinions or orders of the courts below, “precludes the Government from relying on this notice, to the extent it considers it necessary, to facilitate the provision of full contraceptive coverage” going forward.Ibid. Because the Government may rely on this notice, the Government may not impose taxes or penalties on petitioners for failure to provide the relevant notice.The judgments of the Courts of Appeals are vacated, and the cases are remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered."}

Decided June 4, 2007Per Curiam.Imprisoned by the State of Colorado and alleging violations of his Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment protections against cruel and unusual punishment, William Erickson, the petitioner in this Court, filed suit against prison officials in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado. He alleged that a liver condition resulting from hepatitis C required a treatment program that officials had commenced but then wrongfully terminated, with life-threatening consequences. Deeming these allegations, and others to be noted, to be “conclusory,” the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed the District Court’s dismissal of petitioner’s complaint. Fed. Appx. , (). The holding departs in so stark a manner from the pleading standard mandated by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure that we grant review. We vacate the court’s judgment and remand the case for further consideration.Petitioner was incarcerated in the Limon Correctional Facility in Limon, Colorado, where respondents Barry Pardus and Dr. Anita Bloor were working as prison officials. After Dr. Bloor removed petitioner from the hepatitis C treatment he had been receiving, petitioner sued under U. S. C. §, complaining,inter alia, that Dr. Bloor had violated his Eighth Amendment rights by demonstrating deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs. See,e.g.,Estellev.Gamble, U. S. , – () (“[D]eliberate indifference to serious medical needs of prisoners constitutes the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain . . . proscribed by the Eighth Amendment,” and this includes “indifference . . . manifested by prison doctors in their response to the prisoner’s needs or by prison guards in intentionally denying or delaying access to medical care or intentionally interfering with the treatment once prescribed” (footnotes and internal quotation marks omitted)); see alsoHellingv.McKinney, U. S. , – ().Petitioner based his claim on the following allegations, which we assume to be true for purposes of review here: Officials at Colorado’s Department of Corrections (Department) diagnosed petitioner as requiring treatment for hepatitis C. After completing the necessary classes and otherwise complying with the protocols set forth by the Department, petitioner began treatment for the disease. The treatment, which would take a year to complete, involved weekly self-injections of medication by use of a syringe. Soon after petitioner began this treatment, prison officials were unable to account for one of the syringes made available to petitioner (and other prisoners) for medical purposes. Upon searching, they found it in a communal trash can, modified in a manner suggestive of use for injection of illegal drugs. Prisoner Complaint in Civ. Action No. –CV––LTB–MJW (D. Colo.), p. 3 (hereinafter Petitioner’s Complaint).Prison officials, disbelieving petitioner’s claim not to have taken the syringe, found that his conduct constituted a violation of the Colorado Code of Penal Discipline for possession of drug paraphernalia. Letter from Anthony A. DeCesaro to William Erickson (Sept. , ), attached to Petitioner’s Complaint. This conduct, according to the officials, led to the “reasonable inference” that petitioner had intended to use drugs, so the officials removed petitioner from his hepatitis C treatment.Ibid. “The successful treatment of Hepatitis C is incumbent upon the individual remaining drug and alcohol free to give the liver a better chance of recovery,” they indicated,ibid., an explanation they later offered to defend against petitioner’s allegations of cruel and unusual punishment, see Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss in Civ. Action No. –CV––LTB–MJW, p. . Assuming that a person in the course of this treatment takes illicit drugs, the prison’s protocol mandates a waiting period of one year followed by a mandatory drug education class lasting six months. Brief in Opposition 4. Petitioner therefore could face a delay of some months before he would be able to restart treatment.In his complaint petitioner alleged Dr. Bloor had “removed [him] from [his] hepatitis C treatment” in violation of department protocol, “thus endangering [his] life.” Petitioner’s Complaint 2. Petitioner attached to the complaint certain grievance forms. In these he claimed, among other things, he was suffering from “continued damage to [his] liver” as a result of the nontreatment. Colorado Dept. of Corrections Offender Grievance Form (June , ). The complaint requested relief including damages and an injunction requiring that the Department treat petitioner for hepatitis C “under the standards of the treatment [protocol] established by [the Department].” Petitioner’s Complaint 8.Three months after filing his complaint, and well before the District Court entered a judgment against him, petitioner filed a Motion for Expedited Review Due to Imminent Danger, in Civ. Action No. –B– (MJW) (D. Colo.). Indicating it was “undisputed” that he had hepatitis C, that he met the Department’s standards for treatment of the disease, and that “furtherance of this disease can cause irreversible damage to [his] liver and possible death,” petitioner alleged that “numerous inmates” in his prison community had died of the disease and that he was “in imminent danger” himself “due to [the Department’s] refusal to treat him.”Ibid. He had identified similar allegations in an earlier filing, explaining that “his liver is suffering irreversible damage” due to the decision to remove him from treatment and that he “will suffer irreparable damage if his disease goes untreated.” Plaintiff’s Objections to the Magistrate’s Recommendations in Civ. Action No. –CV––LTB–MJW, p. 3.Respondents answered these filings with a motion to dismiss. The Magistrate Judge recommended, as relevant, that the District Court dismiss the complaint on the ground it failed to allege Dr. Bloor’s actions had caused petitioner “substantial harm.” Recommendation on Defendants’ Motion To Dismiss, p. . The District Court issued a short order indicating its agreement with the Magistrate Judge and dismissing the complaint.The Court of Appeals affirmed. It quoted extensively from the Magistrate Judge’s discussion of “substantial harm” before holding that petitioner had made “only conclusory allegations to the effect that he has suffered a cognizable independent harm as a result of his removal from the [hepatitis C] treatment program.” Fed. Appx., . Acknowledging decisions by courts that have found Eighth Amendment violations when delays in medical treatment have involved “life-threatening situations and instances in which it is apparent that delay would exacerbate the prisoner’s medical problems” (and that have, moreover, indicated the Eighth Amendment “protects against future harm to an inmate”),id., at (internal quotation marks omitted), the court nevertheless found petitioner’s complaint deficient: Petitioner had, according to the court, failed to “allege that as a result of the discontinuance of the treatment itself shortly after it began or the interruption of treatment for approximately eighteen months he suffered any harm, let alone substantial harm, [other] than what he already faced from the Hepatitis C itself,”id., at (internal quotation marks omitted). Having reached this conclusion, the court saw no need to address whether the complaint alleged facts sufficient to support a finding that Dr. Bloor had made her decisions with a “sufficiently culpable state of mind.”Id., at , (internal quotation marks omitted).It may in the final analysis be shown that the District Court was correct to grant respondents’ motion to dismiss. That is not the issue here, however. It was error for the Court of Appeals to conclude that the allegations in question, concerning harm caused petitioner by the termination of his medication, were too conclusory to establish for pleading purposes that petitioner had suffered “a cognizable independent harm” as a result of his removal from the hepatitis C treatment program.Id., at .Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2) requires only “a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.” Specific facts are not necessary; the statement need only “ ‘give the defendant fair notice of what the . . . claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.’ ”Bell Atlantic Corp.v.Twombly, U. S., at 7–8) (quotingConleyv.Gibson, U. S. , ()). In addition, when ruling on a defendant’s motion to dismiss, a judge must accept as true all of the factual allegations contained in the complaint.Bell Atlantic Corp., at 8–9) (citingSwierkiewiczv.Sorema N. A., U. S. , , n. 1 ();Neitzkev.Williams, U. S. , ();Scheuerv.Rhodes, U. S. , ()).The complaint stated that Dr. Bloor’s decision to remove petitioner from his prescribed hepatitis C medication was “endangering [his] life.” Petitioner’s Complaint 2. It alleged this medication was withheld “shortly after” petitioner had commenced a treatment program that would take one year, that he was “still in need of treatment for this disease,” and that the prison officials were in the meantime refusing to provide treatment.Id., at 3, 4. This alone was enough to satisfy Rule 8(a)(2). Petitioner, in addition, bolstered his claim by making more specific allegations in documents attached to the complaint and in later filings.The Court of Appeals’ departure from the liberal pleading standards set forth by Rule 8(a)(2) is even more pronounced in this particular case because petitioner has been proceeding, from the litigation’s outset, without counsel. A document filedpro seis “to be liberally construed,”Estelle, U. S., at , and “apro secomplaint, however inartfully pleaded, must be held to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers,”ibid.(internal quotation marks omitted). Cf. Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 8(f) (“All pleadings shall be so construed as to do substantial justice”).Whether petitioner’s complaint is sufficient in all respects is a matter yet to be determined, for respondents raised multiple arguments in their motion to dismiss. In particular, the proper application of the controlling legal principles to the facts is yet to be determined. The case cannot, however, be dismissed on the ground that petitioner’s allegations of harm were too conclusory to put these matters in issue. Certiorari and leave to proceedin forma pauperisare granted, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.[REDACTED] would deny the petition for a writ of certiorari."}

Decided December , 2020Per Curiam.The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of (AEDPA) restricts the power of federal courts to grant writs of habeas corpus based on claims that were “adjudicated on the merits” by a state court. U. S. C. §(d). When a state court has applied clearly established federal law to reasonably determined facts in the process of adjudicating a claim on the merits,a federal habeas court may not disturb the state court’s decision unless its error lies “beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.”Harringtonv.Richter, U.S. , (). In this case, the Court of Appeals erred in ordering issuance of a writ of habeas corpus despite ample room for reasonable disagreement about the prisoner’s ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim. In so doing, the Court of Appeals clearly violated this Court’s AEDPA jurisprudence. We therefore grant the petition for certiorari and vacate the judgment below.IARespondent George Kayer murdered Delbert Haas in . Haas, Kayer, and Lisa Kester were on a trip to gamble in Laughlin, Nevada. While there, Kayer borrowed money from Haas and lost it gambling. Kayer then devised a plan to rob Haas, but Kester questioned whether he could get away with robbing someone he knew. Kayer responded, “ ‘I guess I’ll just have to kill him.’ ”Statev.Kayer, Ariz. , , P.2d , (). While the three drove home, Kayer took a detour to a secluded area and stopped on the side of a dirt road. After Haas exited the vehicle to urinate, Kayer grabbed a gun, sneaked up to him, and shot him pointblank in the head. After dragging Haas’ body into some bushes, Kayer stole his wallet, watch, and jewelry, and drove away. Kayer soon realized that he had forgotten to take Haas’ house keys, and he therefore returned to the scene of the crime. Fearing that Haas might not be dead, Kayer shot him in the head again while retrieving his keys. Subsequently, Kayer stole a variety of firearms and other things of value from Haas’ home after instructing Kester to use a police scanner to look out for police activity. The two sold many of the stolen items under aliases, but Kayer was arrested after Kester went to the police. After a jury trial before Judge William T. Kiger, Kayer was found guilty of premeditated first-degree murder and related offenses.After being found guilty, Kayer “made clear his desire to expedite the sentencing process.”Id., at , P. 2d, at . He refused to fully cooperate with a mitigation specialist. When Kayer’s counsel stated that the specialist needed more time to evaluate Kayer’s case, Kayer refused to agree to a continuance, and the trial court ruled him competent to make that choice. At sentencing, the judge again asked Kayer whether he would like more time for investigation, but Kayer “refused the offer and stated he would not cooperate with [the specialist] no matter how long sentencing was delayed.”Id.,at –, P. 2d, at –.The court proceeded to sentencing. At that time, Arizona law required a judge, not a jury, to determine whether certain aggravating circumstances had been established, and a judge was authorized to impose a sentence of death only if at least one such aggravating circumstance was shown and there was no mitigating circumstance that was sufficient to call for leniency. See Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §– (Supp. ); cf.Ringv.Arizona, U.S. , () (subsequently requiring juries “to find an aggravating circumstance necessary for imposition of the death penalty”). In Kayer’s case, the judge found that the State had proved two aggravating factors beyond a reasonable doubt. First, the court concluded that Kayer had been “previously convicted of a serious offense,” §–(F)(2), based on his conviction for first-degree burglary in , see §–(H)(9);Kayer, Ariz., at , P. 2d, at . Second, it determined that Kayer murdered Haas for “pecuniary gain,” see §–(F)(5). On the other side of the balance, the court found that Kayer had demonstrated only one nonstatutory mitigator: his importance in his son’s life. Weighing the aggravating and mitigating factors, Judge Kiger sentenced Kayer to death, and the Arizona Supreme Court affirmed his conviction and sentence.BKayer subsequently filed a petition for postconviction relief in Arizona Superior Court. Among his many claims, Kayer argued that he received ineffective assistance of counsel because his attorneys failed to investigate mitigating circumstances at the outset of the criminal proceedings. The sentencing judge held a 9-day evidentiary hearing.Kayer’s evidence at the hearing broke down into four main categories: evidence that he was addicted to alcohol and gambling; evidence that he had suffered a heart attack about six weeks before the murder; evidence of mental illness, including a diagnosis of bipolar disorder; and evidence that members of his family had suffered from similar addictions and illnesses in the past and that this had affected his childhood. SeeKayerv.Ryan, F.3d , – ( ) (describing evidence in detail).The court denied relief after applying the familiar two-part test fromStricklandv.Washington, U.S. (). The court found that trial counsel’s performance was not deficient because Kayer had refused to cooperate with his mitigation team’s efforts to gather more mitigation evidence. And, in the alternative, the court held that “ifthere had been a finding that the performance prong of theStricklandstandard had been met, . . . no prejudice to the defendant can be found.” App. to Pet. for Cert. . The court added that “[i]n stating this conclusion[, it] ha[d] considered the assertion of mental illness, physical illness, jail conditions, childhood development, and any alcohol or gambling addictions.”Ibid. The Arizona Supreme Court denied Kayer’s petition to review the denial of postconviction relief.Statev.Kayer, No. CR–––PC (Nov. 7, ).CKayer then filed an unsuccessful habeas petition in Federal District Court. See U. S. C. §. Relevant here, the District Court rejected Kayer’s ineffective-assistance claim for failure to show prejudice. As an initial matter, the court concluded that Kayer could not “show prejudice because he waived an extension of the sentencing date and thereby waived presentation of the full-scale mitigation case.”Kayerv.Ryan, WL , * (D Ariz., Oct. , ) (citingSchrirov.Landrigan, U.S. ()). Moreover, the court reasoned that Kayer’s mitigation evidence “fell short of the type of mitigation information that would have influenced the sentencing decision.” WL , *.A divided Ninth Circuit panel reversed. On the question of trial counsel’s performance, the panel rejected the state court’s judgment because, in the judgment of the panel, Kayer’s attorneys should have begun to pursue mitigation evidence promptly after their appointment. And on the question of prejudice, the court conducted its own review of the evidence and found that trial counsel’s alleged failings likely affected Kayer’s sentence. Based on a “comparison of Kayer’s case with other Arizona cases,” the panel drew two conclusions: first, that “the evidence he presented to the [state postconviction] court was sufficient to establish a statutory mitigating circumstance” of mental impairment, F. 3d, at , and second, that there was a reasonable probability that the Arizona Supreme Court would have vacated Kayer’s death sentence on direct review had it been presented with the mitigating evidence offered at the state postconviction relief hearing. For these reasons, the panel majority found that “there is a reasonable probability Kayer’s sentence would have been less than death, and that the state [postconviction] court was unreasonable in concluding otherwise.”Id.,at .Judge Owens dissented in relevant part, explaining that the Arizona postconviction court had not unreasonably applied federal law in light of the aggravating and mitigating circumstances in this case. In his view, Kayer’s mitigating evidence was “hardly overwhelming,” and he argued that the majority had given short shrift to the “undisputedly strong aggravating factor” of pecuniary gain.Id., at . The majority’s holding, he concluded, resulted from “impermissibly substitut[ing] its own judgment that Kayer was prejudiced” for that of the state court.Ibid.Arizona then sought, and the Ninth Circuit denied, rehearing en banc. Judge Bea authored a dissent from the denial of en banc review, which was joined by other judges. SeeKayerv.Ryan, F.3d , (). Judge Bea asserted that “the panel majority cast aside . . . AEDPA’s highly deferential standard of review.”Id.,at . Instead, he wrote, the panel majority had applied a “de-novo-masquerading-as-deference approach” that the “Supreme Court has repeatedly condemned.”Id.,at ; see alsoid.,at , n. 1 (citing cases since in which this Court has reversed the Ninth Circuit’s application of AEDPA). Under AEDPA and this Court’s precedent, he contended, “there [was] no ignoring the obvious conclusion that a reasonable jurist could conclude that Kayer was not in fact prejudiced by his counsel’s failings in this case.”Id.,at . The mitigating impact of Kayer’s new evidence was, at best, “highly debatable.”Id.,at (internal quotation marks omitted). Applying the proper standard of review, Judge Bea explained that “it [was] possible that fairminded jurists could find [Kayer’s] evidenceinsufficientto establish a reasonable probability of a different outcome.”Id.,at (citingRichter, U. S., at ).After the denial of rehearing en banc, Arizona filed a petition for certiorari in this Court.IIAKayer asserts that his death sentence was imposed in violation of his Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel. As the state court recognized, this Court’s decision inStricklandv.Washington, U.S. (), provides the proper framework for assessing that claim. UnderStrickland, Kayer must show that his counsel provided “deficient” performance that “prejudiced the defense.”Id.,at . In the capital sentencing context, the prejudice inquiry asks “whether there is a reasonable probability that, absent the errors, the sentencer—including an appellate court, to the extent it independently reweighs the evidence—would have concluded that the balance of aggravating and mitigating circumstances did not warrant death.”Id.,at . TheStricklandstandard is “highly demanding.”Kimmelmanv.Morrison, U.S. , (). A reasonable probability means a “ ‘substantial,’ not just ‘conceivable,’ likelihood of a different result.”Cullenv.Pinholster, U.S. , () (quotingRichter, U. S., at ).When an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim is presented in a federal habeas petition, a state prisoner faces additional burdens. Among other things, no relief may be granted “with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim,” as relevant here, “resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.” U. S. C. §(d).Here, the state court applied “the correct governing legal principle . . . to the facts of the prisoner’s case,”Lockyerv.Andrade, U.S. , () (internal quotation marks omitted), so the question is whether its decision involved an “unreasonable application of ” this Court’s precedent. To meet that standard, a prisoner must show far more than that the state court’s decision was “merely wrong” or “even clear error.”Virginiav.LeBlanc, U. S., at 3) (internal quotation marks omitted). The prisoner must show that the state court’s decision is so obviously wrong that its error lies “beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.”Richter, U. S., at . Congress “meant” this standard to be “difficult to meet.”Id.,at .We have recognized the special importance of the AEDPA framework in cases involvingStricklandclaims. Ineffective -assistance claims can function “as a way to escape rules of waiver and forfeiture,”Richter, U. S., at , and they can drag federal courts into resolving questions of state law. Moreover, we have recognized that “the more general the rule, the more leeway state courts have.”Sextonv.Beaudreaux, U. S., at 8) (quotingRenicov.Lett, U.S. , (); quotation modified). “[B]ecause theStricklandstandard is a general standard, a state court has even more latitude to reasonably determine that a defendant has not satisfied that standard.”Knowlesv.Mirzayance, U.S. , ().BThe Ninth Circuit resolved this case in a manner fundamentally inconsistent with AEDPA. Most striking, the panel “essentially evaluated the meritsde novo, only tacking on a perfunctory statement at the end of its analysis asserting that the state court’s decision was unreasonable.”Beaudreaux, U. S., at 7); seeRichter, U. S., at –. In other words, it appears “to have treated the unreasonableness question as a test of its confidence in the result it would reach underde novoreview.”Id., at . More specifically, the panel concludedde novothat “there is a reasonable probability Kayer’s sentence would have been less than death,” and then simply appended the statement that “the state [postconviction review] court was unreasonable in concluding otherwise.” F. 3d, at . Indeed, the panel repeatedly reached conclusions—such as that the “evidence presented to the [postconviction] court established the statutory mitigating circumstance of mental impairment,”id.,at , and that there was a “causal connection between Kayer’s mental impairment and the crime,”ibid.—without ever framing the relevant question as whether a fairminded jurist could reach a different conclusion.Applying the proper standard of review, we vacate the Court of Appeals’ judgment. Judge Kiger found that Kayer had failed to show deficient performance and, assuming deficient performance, that he failed to show prejudice.[1] Federal courts may not disturb the judgments of state courts unless “eachground supporting the state court decision is examined and found to be unreasonable.”Wetzelv.Lambert, U.S. , () (per curiam). Thus, if a fairminded jurist could agree with either Judge Kiger’s deficiency or prejudice holding, the reasonableness of the other is “beside the point.”Id.,at ; seeParkerv.Matthews, U.S. , () (per curiam) (“[I]t is irrelevant [whether] the court also invoked a ground of questionable validity”);Richter, U. S., at .We focus on the state court’s prejudice determination. Insofar as the state court offered its conclusion on the prejudice question without articulating its reasoning supporting that conclusion, we “must determine what arguments or theories . . . could have supported the state court’s” determination that Kayer failed to show prejudice.Id., at . Then we must assess whether “ ‘fairminded jurists could disagree’ on the correctness of the state court’s decision” if based on one of those arguments or theories.Id.,at (quotingYarboroughv.Alvarado, U.S. , ()); seePinholster, U. S., at .Perhaps the most probable reason for Judge Kiger’s no-prejudice determination is simply that the new mitigation evidence offered in the postconviction proceeding did not create a substantial likelihood of a different sentencing outcome. The Ninth Circuit generally considered that possibility, but in so doing impermissibly “substituted its own judgment for that of the state court” instead of applying deferential review.Woodfordv.Visciotti, U.S. , () (per curiam).[2] It characterized Kayer’s prior-offense aggravator (first-degree burglary) as “relatively weak” in comparison with other offenses that qualified under the Arizona capital sentencing law. F. 3d, at . And on the other side of the balance, it attributed considerable weight to evidence that it viewed as showing that Kayer’s “capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law was significantly impaired.” Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §–(G)(1).Perhaps some jurists would share those views, but that is not the relevant standard. The question is whether a fairminded jurist could take a different view. SeeVisciotti, U. S., at –; see alsoPinholster, U. S., at –. And the answer is yes. For one thing, a fairminded jurist might differently evaluate the effect of Kayer’s prior-offense aggravator (let alone the pecuniary gain aggravator). Arizona first-degree burglary required as an element that he or an accomplice was “armed with explosives, a deadly weapon or a dangerous instrument.” Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §–(A) (). And Judge Kiger determined that Kayer “was armed with a . caliber handgun” during his prior offense. Excerpts of Record in No. – (), p. . A fairminded jurist could see Kayer’s past conviction as having substantial weight in the context of this murder by shooting.Fairminded jurists also could take a different view of Kayer’s mitigating evidence. Kayer offered evidence that he suffered from bipolar disorder and untreated drinking and gambling addictions at the time of the crime, but reasonable jurists could debate the extent to which these factors significantly impaired his ability to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the law at the time of the murder. For example, the record reveals that Kayer had extensive opportunities to consider his actions—planning the murder in advance, driving his victim to a remote area, and subsequently returning to the murder scene and shooting the victim in the head a second time. Moreover, Kayer’s planning of the murder, efforts to hide the body, interactions with Kester before and after the murder, and attempts to profit from his crimes using an alias display a measure of control and intentionality. On this record, a fairminded jurist reasonably could conclude that Kayer’s evidence of mental impairment, in the words of Judge Owens, was “hardly overwhelming.” F. 3d, at ; see also F. 3d, at – (Bea, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc).Kayer counters that his claim is unusually strong because the Arizona Supreme Court would have “independently reweigh[ed] the evidence” on direct appeal.Strickland, U. S., at . In his view, the similarity between his postconviction case and judgments that the State Supreme Court has issued in other cases on direct review supports hisStricklandclaim. Arizona responds that the State Supreme Court would not have reweighed the evidence in the manner contemplated byStrickland. And it asks this Court to hold that past state judgments on direct review are categorically irrelevant to AEDPA review.We need not address these broad questions in order to resolve this case. Even if Arizona’s sentencing practices involved reweighing evidence on direct appeal, capital sentencing requires “anindividualizeddetermination on the basis of the character of the individual and the circumstances of the crime.”Zantv.Stephens, U.S. , (). For present purposes, it suffices to say that, because the facts in each capital sentencing case are unique, the weighing of aggravating and mitigating evidence in a prior published decision is unlikely to provide clear guidance about how a state court would weigh the evidence in a later case.Kayer, like the panel below, focuses his argument on the Arizona Supreme Court’s decision inStatev.Brookover, Ariz. , P.2d (), but that decision falls far short of placing the state court’s prejudice determination in this case beyond the realm of fairminded disagreement. InBrookover,there was only one aggravating circumstance (a prior conviction for a serious offense), whereas Kayer’s sentencing involved two statutory aggravators.[3] And as for the mitigating evidence inBrookover, while it is far from clear exactly what mitigating evidence influenced the court’s individualized sentencing determination, the opinion refers to evidence that appears significantly different from that in this case. TheBrookoveropinion refers to evidence of a “ ‘neurological lesion’ ” of a type that caused “ ‘a relinquishment of one’s self autonomy.’ ”Id., at , P. 2d, at . By contrast, a reasonable jurist could view Kayer’s mitigation evidence in a different light for the reasons explained above. In these circumstances, theBrookoverdecision does not come close to showing the sort of “extreme malfunctio[n] in the state criminal justice syste[m]” that would permit federal court intervention.Richter, U. S., at (internal quotation marks omitted).* * *Under AEDPA, state courts play the leading role in assessing challenges to state sentences based on federal law. A state court heard Kayer’s evidence and concluded that he failed to show prejudice. The court below exceeded its authority in rejecting that determination, which was not so obviously wrong as to be “beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.”Id., at . Under §(d), that is “ ‘the only question that matters.’ ”Id.,at .We grant the petition for a writ of certiorari, vacate the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, and remand the case to that court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.[REDACTED], [REDACTED], and [REDACTED] dissent.Notes1Section calls for review of the “last state-court adjudication on the merits.”Greenev.Fisher, U.S. , (). The Ninth Circuit treated the Superior Court’s decision, rather than the Arizona Supreme Court’s denial of review, as the last state-court adjudication on the merits. Unreasoned dispositions by appellate courts sometimes qualify as adjudications on the merits. In those cases, we apply a rebuttable presumption that the appellate court’s decision rested on the same grounds as the reasoned decision of a lower court. SeeWilsonv.Sellers, U. S. We may assume without deciding that the Arizona Supreme Court’s denial of discretionary review was not a merits adjudication because we conclude that the Superior Court did not unreasonably apply federal law. In these circumstances, there would be no need to consider whether an unreasoned decision of a higher court may have rested on different grounds than the decision of a lower court.2In its efforts to distinguishWoodfordv.Visciotti, U.S. , the panel found it “critically important” thatVisciottiinvolved postconviction review by a State Supreme Court. The panel emphasized that here, by contrast, it did not “know how the Arizona Supreme Court would have assessed [the new] evidence on collateral review because the Court denied without explanation Kayer’s petition for review.”Kayerv.Ryan, F.3d , (). But the lower court and the parties have not identified anything in AEDPA or this Court’s precedents permitting reduced deference to merits decisions of lower state courts. See U. S. C. §.3The Ninth Circuit brushed past this distinction, reasoning that the Arizona Supreme Courtcouldhave found a pecuniary gain aggravating factor based on the facts ofBrookover. But that does not change the fact that theBrookovercourt did not weigh any second aggravating factor in reaching its decision. See Ariz., at –, P. 2d, at –."}
{"file_name": "per curiam_2015_7_577.json", "author": "per curiam", "year": 2015, "text": "–. Decided November 9, 2015Per Curiam.On the night of March , , Sergeant Randy Baker of the Tulia, Texas Police Department followed Israel Leija, Jr., to a drive-in restaurant, with a warrant for his arrest. F.3d , – ( ). When Baker approached Leija’s car and informed him that he was under arrest, Leija sped off, headed for Interstate . WL , *1 (ND Tex., Aug. 7, ). Baker gave chase and was quickly joined by Trooper Gabriel Rodriguez of the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS). F. 3d, at .Leija entered the interstate and led the officers on an -minute chase at speeds between and miles per hour.Ibid. Twice during the chase, Leija called the Tulia Police dispatcher, claiming to have a gun and threatening to shoot at police officers if they did not abandon their pursuit. The dispatcher relayed Leija’s threats, together with a report that Leija might be intoxicated, to all concerned officers.As Baker and Rodriguez maintained their pursuit, other law enforcement officers set up tire spikes at three locations. Officer Troy Ducheneaux of the Canyon Police Department manned the spike strip at the first location Leija was expected to reach, beneath the overpass at Cemetery Road. Ducheneaux and the other officers had received training on the deployment of spike strips, including on how to take a defensive position so as to minimize the risk posed by the passing driver.Ibid.DPS Trooper Chadrin Mullenix also responded. He drove to the Cemetery Road overpass, initially intending to set up a spike strip there. Upon learning of the other spike strip positions, however, Mullenix began to consider another tactic: shooting at Leija’s car in order to disable it. WL , *1. Mullenix had not received training in this tactic and had not attempted it before, but he radioed the idea to Rodriguez. Rodriguez responded “–4,” gave Mullenix his position, and said that Leija had slowed to miles per hour. Mullenix then asked the DPS dispatcher to inform his supervisor, Sergeant Byrd, of his plan and ask if Byrd thought it was “worth doing.” F. 3d,at –. Before receiving Byrd’s response, Mullenix exited his vehicle and, armed with his service rifle, took a shooting position on the overpass, feet above I–. Respondents allege that from this position, Mullenix still could hear Byrd’s response to “stand by” and “see if the spikes work first.”Ibid.[1]*As Mullenix waited for Leija to arrive, he and another officer, Randall County Sheriff’s Deputy Tom Shipman, discussed whether Mullenix’s plan would work and how and where to shoot the vehicle to best carry it out. WL , *2. Shipman also informed Mullenix that another officer was located beneath the overpass. F. 3d, at .Approximately three minutes after Mullenix took up his shooting position, he spotted Leija’s vehicle, with Rodriguez in pursuit. As Leija approached the overpass, Mullenix fired six shots. Leija’s car continued forward beneath the overpass, where it engaged the spike strip, hit the median, and rolled two and a half times. It was later determined that Leija had been killed by Mullenix’s shots, four of which struck his upper body. There was no evidence that any of Mullenix’s shots hit the car’s radiator, hood, or engine block.Id., at –; WL , *2–*3.Respondents sued Mullenix under Rev. Stat. §, U. S. C. §, alleging that he had violated the Fourth Amendment by using excessive force against Leija. Mullenix moved for summary judgment on the ground of qualified immunity, but the District Court denied his motion, finding that “[t]here are genuine issues of fact as to whether Trooper Mullenix acted recklessly, or acted as a reasonable, trained peace officer would have acted in the same or similar circumstances.” WL , *6.Mullenix appealed, and the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed. F.3d (). The court agreed with the District Court that the “immediacy of the risk posed by Leija is a disputed fact that a reasonable jury could find either in the plaintiffs’ favor or in the officer’s favor, precluding us from concluding that Mullenix acted objectively reasonably as a matter of law.”Id., at .Judge King dissented. She described the “ ‘fact issue’ referenced by the majority” as “simply a restatement of the objective reasonableness test that applies to Fourth Amendment excessive force claims,” which, she noted, the Supreme Court has held “ ‘is a pure question of law.’ ”Id., at – (quotingScottv.Harris, U.S. , , n. 8 ()). Turning to that legal question, Judge King concluded that Mullenix’s actions were objectively reasonable. When Mullenix fired, she emphasized, he knew not only that Leija had threatened to shoot the officers involved in his pursuit, but also that Leija was seconds away from encountering such an officer beneath the overpass. Judge King also dismissed the notion that Mullenix should have given the spike strips a chance to work. She explained that because spike strips are often ineffective, and because officers operating them are vulnerable to gunfire from passing cars, Mullenix reasonably feared that the officers manning them faced a significant risk of harm. F. 3d, at –.Mullenix sought rehearing en banc before the Fifth Circuit, but the court denied his petition. Judge Jolly dissented, joined by six other members of the court. Judge King, who joined Judge Jolly’s dissent, also filed a separate dissent of her own. F.3d () (per curiam). On the same day, however, the two members forming the original panel’s majority withdrew their previous opinion and substituted a new one. F.3d . The revised opinion recognized that objective unreasonableness is a question of law that can be resolved on summary judgment—as Judge King had explained in her dissent—but reaffirmed the denial of qualified immunity.Id., at , . The majority concluded that Mullenix’s actions were objectively unreasonable because several of the factors that had justified deadly force in previous cases were absent here: There were no innocent bystanders, Leija’s driving was relatively controlled, Mullenix had not first given the spike strips a chance to work, and Mullenix’s decision was not a split-second judgment.Id., at –. The court went on to conclude that Mullenix was not entitled to qualified immunity because “the law was clearly established such that a reasonable officer would have known that the use of deadly force, absent a sufficiently substantial and immediate threat, violated the Fourth Amendment.”Id., at .We address only the qualified immunity question, not whether there was a Fourth Amendment violation in the first place, and now reverse.The doctrine of qualified immunity shields officials from civil liability so long as their conduct “ ‘does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.’ ”Pearsonv.Callahan, U.S. , () (quotingHarlowv.Fitzgerald, U.S. , ()). A clearly established right is one that is “sufficiently clear that every reasonable official would have understood that what he is doing violates that right.”Reichlev.Howards, U. S., at 5) (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted). “We do not require a case directly on point, but existing precedent must have placed the statutory or constitutional question beyond debate.”Ashcroftv.al-Kidd, U.S. , (). Put simply, qualified immunity protects “all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.”Malleyv.Briggs, U.S. , ().“We have repeatedly told courts . . . not to define clearly established law at a high level of generality.”al-Kidd,supra, at . The dispositive question is “whether the violative nature ofparticularconduct is clearly established.”Ibid.(emphasis added). This inquiry “ ‘must be undertaken in light of the specific context of the case, not as a broad general proposition.’ ”Brosseauv.Haugen, U.S. , () (per curiam) (quotingSaucierv.Katz, U.S. , ()). Such specificity is especially important in the Fourth Amendment context, where the Court has recognized that “[i]t is sometimes difficult for an officer to determine how the relevant legal doctrine, here excessive force, will apply to the factual situation the officer confronts.” U. S., at .In this case, the Fifth Circuit held that Mullenix violated the clearly established rule that a police officer may not “ ‘use deadly force against a fleeing felon who does not pose a sufficient threat of harm to the officer or others.’ ” F. 3d, at . Yet this Court has previously considered—and rejected—almost that exact formulation of the qualified immunity question in the Fourth Amendment context. InBrosseau, which also involved the shooting of a suspect fleeing by car, the Ninth Circuit denied qualified immu- nity on the ground that the officer had violated the clearly established rule, set forth inTennesseev.Garner, U.S. 1(), that “deadly force is only permissible where the officer has probable cause to believe that the suspect poses a threat of serious physical harm, either to the officer or to others.”Haugenv.Brosseau, F.3d , ( ) (internal quotation marks omitted). This Court summarily reversed, holding that use ofGar- ner’s “general” test for excessive force was “mistaken.”Brosseau, U. S., at . The correct inquiry, the Court explained, was whether it was clearly established that the Fourth Amendment prohibited the officer’s conduct in the “ ‘situation [she] confronted’: whether to shoot a disturbed felon, set on avoiding capture through vehicular flight, when persons in the immediate area are at risk from that flight.”Id., at –. The Court considered three court of appeals cases discussed by the parties, noted that “this area is one in which the result depends very much on the facts of each case,” and concluded that the officer was entitled to qualified immunity because “[n]one of [the cases]squarely governsthe case here.”Id.,at (emphasis added).Andersonv.Creighton, U.S. (), is also instructive on the required degree of specificity. There, the lower court had denied qualified immunity based on the clearly established “right to be free from warrantless searches of one’s home unless the searching officers have probable cause and there are exigent circumstances.”Id., at . This Court faulted that formulation for failing to address the actual question at issue: whether “the circumstances with which Anderson was confronted . . . constitute[d] probable cause and exigent circumstances.”Id., at –. Without answering that question, the Court explained, the conclusion that Anderson’s search was objectively unreasonable did not “follow immediately” from—and thus was not clearly established by—the principle that warrantless searches not supported by probable cause and exigent circumstances violate the Fourth Amendment.Id., at .In this case, Mullenix confronted a reportedly intoxi- cated fugitive, set on avoiding capture through high-speed vehicular flight, who twice during his flight had threatened to shoot police officers, and who was moments away from encountering an officer at Cemetery Road. The relevant inquiry is whether existing precedent placed the conclusion that Mullenix acted unreasonably in these circumstances “beyond debate.”al-Kidd,supra,at . The general principle that deadly force requires a sufficient threat hardly settles this matter. SeePascov.Knoblauch, F.3d , ( ) (“[I]t would be unreasonable to expect a police officer to make the numerous legal conclusions necessary to applyGarnerto a high-speed car chase . . .”).Far from clarifying the issue, excessive force cases involving car chases reveal the hazy legal backdrop against which Mullenix acted. InBrosseauitself, the Court held that an officer did not violate clearly established law when she shot a fleeing suspect out of fear that he endangered “other officers on foot who [she]believedwere in the immediate area,” “the occupied vehicles in [his] path,” and “any other citizens whomightbe in the area.” U. S., at (first alteration in original; internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis added). The threat Leija posed was at least as immediate as that presented by a suspect who had just begun to drive off and was headed only in the general direction of officers and bystanders.Id., at –. By the time Mullenix fired, Leija had led police on a -mile chase at extremely high speeds, was reportedly intoxicated, had twice threatened to shoot officers, and was racing towards an officer’s location.This Court has considered excessive force claims in connection with high-speed chases on only two occasions sinceBrosseau. InScottv.Harris, U.S. , the Court held that an officer did not violate the Fourth Amendment by ramming the car of a fugitive whose reckless driving “posed an actual and imminent threat to the lives of any pedestrians who might have been present, to other civilian motorists, and to the officers involved in the chase.”Id.,at . And inPlumhoffv.Rickard, U. S.” U. S., at ). The Court has thus never found the use of deadly force in connection with a dangerous car chase to violate the Fourth Amendment, let alone to be a basis for denying qualified immunity. Leija in his flight did not pass as many cars as the drivers inScottorPlumhoff; traffic was light on I–. At the same time, the fleeing fugitives inScottandPlumhoffhad not verbally threatened to kill any officers in their path, nor were they about to come upon such officers. In any event, none of our precedents “squarely governs” the facts here. Given Leija’s conduct, we cannot say that only someone “plainly incompetent” or who “knowingly violate[s] the law” would have perceived a sufficient threat and acted as Mullenix did.Malley, U. S., at .The dissent focuses on the availability of spike strips as an alternative means of terminating the chase. It argues that even if Leija posed a threat sufficient to justify deadly force in some circumstances, Mullenix nevertheless contravened clearly established law because he did not wait to see if the spike strips would work before taking action. Spike strips, however, present dangers of their own, not only to drivers who encounter them at speeds between and miles per hour, but also to officers manning them. See,e.g., Thompsonv.Mercer, F.3d , ( ); Brief for National Association of Police Organizations et al. asAmici –. Nor are spike strips always successful in ending the chase. See,e.g., Cordovav.Aragon, F.3d , ( ); Brief for National Association of Police Organizations et al. asAmici (citing examples). The dissent can cite no case from this Court denying qualified immunity because officers entitled to terminate a high-speed chase selected one dangerous alternative over another.Even so, the dissent argues, there was no governmental interest that justified acting before Leija’s car hit the spikes. Mullenix explained, however, that he feared Leija might attempt to shoot at or run over the officers manning the spike strips. Mullenix also feared that even if Leija hit the spike strips, he might still be able to continue driving in the direction of other officers. The dissent ignores these interests by suggesting that there was no “possible marginal gain in shooting at the car over using the spike strips already in place.”Post, at 4 (opinion of [REDACTED], J.). In fact, Mullenix hoped his actions would stop the car in a manner that avoided the risks to other officers and other drivers that relying on spike strips would entail. The dissent disputes the merits of the options available to Mullenix,post, at 3–4, but others with more experience analyze the issues differently. See,e.g.,Brief for National Association of Police Organizations et al. asAmici –. Ultimately, whatever can be said of the wisdom of Mullenix’s choice, this Court’s precedents do not place the conclusion that he acted unreasonably in these circumstances “beyond debate.”al-Kidd, U. S., at .More fundamentally, the dissent repeats the Fifth Circuit’s error. It defines the qualified immunity inquiry at a high level of generality—whether any governmental interest justified choosing one tactic over another—and then fails to consider that question in “the specific context of the case.”Brosseauv.Haugen, U. S., at (internal quotation marks omitted). As inAnderson, the conclusion that Mullenix’s reasons were insufficient to justify his actions simply does not “follow immediately” from the general proposition that force must be justified. U. S., at .Cases decided by the lower courts sinceBrosseaulikewise have not clearly established that deadly force is inappropriate in response to conduct like Leija’s. The Fifth Circuit here principally relied on its own decision inLytlev.Bexar County, F.3d (), denying qualified immunity to a police officer who had fired at a fleeing car and killed one of its passengers. That holding turned on the court’s assumption, for purposes of summary judgment, that the car was moving away from the officer and had already traveled some distance at the moment the officer fired. Seeid., at . The court held that a reasonable jury could conclude that a receding car “did not pose a sufficient threat of harm such that the use of deadly force was reasonable.”Id., at . But, crucially, the court also recognized that if the facts were as the officer alleged, and he fired as the car was coming towards him, “he would likely be entitled to qualified immunity” based on the “threat of immediate and severe physical harm.”Id., at . Without implying thatLytlewas either correct or incorrect, it suffices to say thatLytledoes not clearly dictate the conclusion that Mullenix was unjustified in perceiving grave danger and responding accordingly, given that Leija was speeding towards a confrontation with officers he had threatened to kill.Cases that the Fifth Circuit ignored also suggest that Mullenix’s assessment of the threat Leija posed was reasonable. InLongv.Slaton, F.3d (), for example, the Eleventh Circuit held that a sheriff’s deputy did not violate the Fourth Amendment by fatally shooting a mentally unstable individual who was attempting to flee in the deputy’s car, even though at the time of the shooting the individual had not yet operated the cruiser dangerously. The court explained that “the law does not require officers in a tense and dangerous situation to wait until the moment a suspect uses a deadly weapon to act to stop the suspect” and concluded that the deputy had reason to believe Long was dangerous based on his unstable state of mind, theft of the cruiser, and failure to heed the deputy’s warning to stop.Id., at –. The court also rejected the notion that the deputy should have first tried less lethal methods, such as spike strips. “[C]onsidering the unpredictability of Long’s behavior and his fleeing in a marked police cruiser,” the court held, “we think the police need not have taken that chance and hoped for the best.”Id., at (alteration and internal quotation marks omitted). But seeSmithv.Cupp, F.3d , – ( ) (denying qualified immunity to an officer who shot an intoxicated suspect who had stolen the officer’s cruiser where a reasonable jury could have concluded that the suspect’s flight did not immediately threaten the officer or any other bystander).Other cases cited by the Fifth Circuit and respondents are simply too factually distinct to speak clearly to the specific circumstances here. Several involve suspects who may have done little more than flee at relatively low speeds. See,e.g.,Walkerv.Davis, F.3d , ( );Kirbyv.Duva, F.3d , – ( );Adamsv.Speers, F.3d , ( );Vaughanv.Cox, F.3d , –, and n. 7 ( ). These cases shed little light on whether the far greater danger of a speeding fugitive threatening to kill police officers waiting in his path could warrant deadly force. The court below noted that “no weapon was ever seen,” F. 3d, at , but surely in these circumstances the police were justified in taking Leija at his word when he twice told the dispatcher he had a gun and was prepared to use it.Finally, respondents argue that the danger Leija represented was less substantial than the threats that courts have found sufficient to justify deadly force. But the mere fact that courts have approved deadly force in more extreme circumstances says little, if anything, about whether such force was reasonable in the circumstances here. The fact is that when Mullenix fired, he reasonably understood Leija to be a fugitive fleeing arrest, at speeds over miles per hour, who was armed and possibly intoxicated, who had threatened to kill any officer he saw if the police did not abandon their pursuit, and who was racing towards Officer Ducheneaux’s position. Even accepting that these circumstances fall somewhere between the two sets of cases respondents discuss, qualified immunity protects actions in the “ ‘hazy border between excessive and acceptable force.’ ”Brosseau,supra, at (quotingSaucier, U. S., at ; some internal quotation marks omitted).Because the constitutional rule applied by the Fifth Circuit was not “ ‘beyond debate,’ ”Stantonv.Sims, U. S., at 8), we grant Mullenix’s petition for certiorari and reverse the Fifth Circuit’s determination that Mullenix is not entitled to qualified immunity.It is so ordered.* Although Mullenix disputes hearing Byrd’s response, we view the facts in the light most favorable to respondents, who oppose Mullenix’s motion for summary judgment.

Decided March , 2021Per Curiam.A Tennessee jury found Anthony Hines guilty of murdering Katherine Jenkins at a motel. Witnesses saw Hines fleeing in the victim’s car and wearing a bloody shirt, and his family members heard him admit to stabbingsomeoneat the motel. But almost years later, the Sixth Circuit held that Hines was entitled to a new trial and sentence because his attorney should have tried harder to blame another man. In reaching its conclusion, the Sixth Circuit disregarded the overwhelming evidence of guilt that supported the contrary conclusion of a Tennessee court. This approach plainly violated Congress’ prohibition on disturbing state-court judgments on federal habeas review absent an error that lies “ ‘beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.’ ”Shinnv.Kayer, U. S., at 1); U. S. C. §(d). We now reverse.IOn March 1, , Hines boarded a bus traveling from Raleigh, North Carolina, to Bowling Green, Kentucky. His girlfriend and her mother had given him the bus ticket and $. Hines also carried with him a hunting knife concealed beneath his shirt. When the mother asked about the knife, Hines explained: “ ‘I never go anywhere naked.’ ” “ ‘I always have my blade.’ ” Record inHinesv.Carpenter, No. 3:–cv– (MD Tenn.), Doc. –4, p. .Hines’ travels brought him to the outskirts of Nashville, where he checked into the CeBon Motel. Jenkins worked there as a maid. A few hours after Hines’ arrival, the manager put Jenkins in charge of the motel and provided her with a bag of money to make change for departing guests.In the early afternoon, another visitor found Jenkins’ body in one of the rooms. She was wrapped in a bloody bedsheet, and an autopsy later revealed several knife wounds that included deep punctures to her chest and genitalia. Her money, wallet, and car keys were missing, as was her vehicle. Around the same time, another employee saw a man leaving the motel in Jenkins’ car. The employee tried to follow the vehicle, but it sped away.Later that afternoon, a group of travelers found Hines and the car—now broken down—along the side of the road, and they offered to drive him toward his sister’s home in Bowling Green. During the trip, the travelers observed that Hines had dried blood on his shirt and was carrying a folded-up jacket. They also noticed that Hines “seemed real nervous,” “ke[pt] contradicting himself,” and “talked a lot,” at one point claiming that he had purchased the car from an “old lady for $ or $.”Id., Doc. –2, at , ;id., Doc. –3, at –.Hines told a different story to his family. His sister noticed the blood, and Hines admitted that he had stabbed somebody at the motel—although he described the victim as a male employee who had assaulted him. For good measure, Hines physically demonstrated how he had knifed the supposed assailant. Despite his inability to pay for a bus ticket just a few days earlier, Hines purchased a barbecue grill and informed his sister that he had acquired a substantial sum of money. Family members also noticed that he had the keys to Jenkins’ car, which were on a distinctive keychain. According to Hines, he had taken the keys in a struggle with yet another man who had tried to rob him.Hines altered his tale again when he surrendered to law enforcement. Before the sheriff started questioning him, Hines volunteered that “he took the automobile but he didn’t murder the woman.”Id., at –, . But Hines later changed his mind and offered to confess to the murder if the sheriff “could guarantee him the death penalty.”Id., Doc. –4, at .The investigation turned up other physical evidence connecting Hines to the crime. Police found Jenkins’ wallet where Hines had abandoned her car. And a search of his motel room revealed stab marks on the walls that were similar in size to the wounds on Jenkins’ body. When an investigator asked Hines about the damage, he identified the holes as “ ‘knife marks.’ ”Id., at –.The jury heard all of this evidence at trial. It also heard testimony from the man—Kenneth Jones—who had discovered Jenkins’ body. According to Jones, he knew the owners of the motel and had stopped by on the afternoon of the murder. Finding no one in the office, Jones had lingered outside before realizing that he needed to use the bathroom. He returned to the office, took a key, and entered the room. Hines’ counsel stressed to the jury this oddly fortuitous sequence of events, noting that “Jones was fooling around at that motel that Sunday afternoon”; that Jones seemed “nervous”; and that Jones just happened to be present when “[t]here was a lot of something going on.”Id., Doc. –6, at –. The jury also heard discrepancies between Jones’ account of finding the body and the timeline given by first responders. But it found Hines guilty.The full truth came out several years later when Hines sought postconviction review in the Tennessee courts. In a new statement, Jones admitted that he was at the motel neither by happenstance nor by himself, but rather in the company of a woman other than his wife. The duo had rendezvoused at the motel nearly every Sunday for at least two years, and Jones was well known to the staff. But when Jones and his companion arrived on the day of the murder, they found no one to greet them. After waiting for a while, first at the motel and then at a nearby restaurant, Jones became impatient and helped himself to a room key from the office. Upon finding the body, he quickly returned to his vehicle—a fact confirmed by his companion who watched through the room’s open curtains as Jones entered and left. Jones then called the authorities, drove his companion home, and returned to the motel to meet the sheriff.The postconviction proceedings also revealed that Hines’ attorney was generally aware of Jones’ affair from the outset, yet had decided to spare him the embarrassment of aggressively pursuing the matter.Hinesv.State, WL , *8 (Tenn. Crim. App., July , ). But despite Hines’ current insistence that this choice amounted to ineffective assistance of counsel, the Tennessee postconviction court found no prejudice.Id., at *, *–*; see alsoStricklandv.Washington, U.S. , () (“[T]he defendant must show that . . . counsel’s errors were so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial”). The court stressed “the strength of proof against [Hines],” and it dismissed as “ ‘farfetched’ ” that trial counsel should have accused Jones of committing (and self-reporting) a grisly crime in a public place where he was “known by the staff.”Hines, WL , *. Such an argument, the court explained, “could have resulted in a loss of credibility for the defense.”Ibid.The court also observed that the emergence of a new corroborating witness—Jones’ companion—further undermined any suggestion that he was the culprit.Id., at *. And though Jones’ evolving story deprived the jury of all the facts, the court reasoned that his “true purpose for being at the [m]otel” had little relevance to Hines’ conviction or sentence.Ibid.Sixteen years later, a divided panel of the Sixth Circuit disagreed. Fed. Appx. (). According to the majority, a better investigation “could have helped the defense to credibly cast Jones as an alternative suspect, or at the very least seriously undermine his testimony.”Id., at . For example, trial counsel could have claimed that Jones killed Jenkins to cover up his affair. Counsel might also have highlighted that Jones was planning to rent a room from Jenkins on the day of the crime.Id., at –. Or counsel might have better stressed potential flaws in Jones’ version of events, such as discrepancies about the exact time he reported the murder.Id., at . The majority further surmised that Hines had “no clear motive” for the murder, and it noted the absence of “DNA or fingerprint evidence.”Id., at .Missing from this analysis, however, was the voluminous evidence of Hines’ guilt. Among many other things, the majority disregarded Hines’ flight in a bloodstained shirt, his theft of the vehicle and money, and his ever-changing stories about stabbing and robbing various people on the day of the crime. See generallyid., at –.Judge Kethledge dissented. In his view, the majority “ ‘nowhere g[ave] deference to the state courts, nowhere explain[ed] why their application ofStricklandwas unreasonable rather than merely (in the majority’s view) incorrect, and nowhere explain[ed] why fairminded jurists could view [Hines’] claim only the same way the majority d[id].’ ”Id., at . Judge Kethledge then reviewed all of the evidence ignored by the majority. He found “zero reason to think that, after investigation, counsel could have presented Jones as the ‘real killer.’ ”Id., at . And he explained that impeaching Jones “would have been a waste of time” because Jones had “offered no testimony regarding Hine[s’ ] guilt.”Ibid.IIHines’ legal theory is straightforward: A competent attorney would have presented the full truth about Jones’ affair and blamed him for the crime. According to Hines, this strategy would have deflected so much suspicion—or at least so undermined Jones’ credibility—that counsel’s omission created a “ ‘substantial’ ” risk of “a different result.”Cullenv.Pinholster, U.S. , (). In fact, Hines reasons that, “had [he] not been found with Mrs. Jenkins’ car,Joneswould have been the primary suspect.” Brief in Opposition (emphasis added).Our analysis is straightforward too. Because a Tennessee court considered and rejected Hines’ theory, a federal court “shall not” grant a writ of habeas corpus unless the earlier decision took an “unreasonable” view of the facts or law. §(d). This “standard is difficult to meet.”Harringtonv.Richter, U.S. , (). The term “unreasonable” refers not to “ordinary error” or even to circumstances where the petitioner offers “a strong case for relief,” but rather to “ ‘extreme malfunctions in the state criminal justice syste[m].’ ”Ibid.In other words, a federal court may intrude on a State’s “ ‘sovereign power to punish offenders’ ” only when a decision “was so lacking in justification . . . beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.”Id., at .If this rule means anything, it is that a federal court must carefully consider all the reasons and evidence supporting the state court’s decision. After all, there is no way to hold that a decision was “lacking in justification” without identifying—let alone rebutting—all of the justifications.Ibid.Any other approach would allow a federal court to “ ‘essentially evaluat[e] the meritsde novo’ ” by omitting inconvenient details from its analysis.Shinn, U. S., at 8–9); see alsoRichter, U. S., at –.The Sixth Circuit did precisely that. Nowhere in its -page discussion of Hines’ theory did the majority consider the substantial evidence linking him to the crime: His flight in a bloody shirt; his possession of the victim’s keys, wallet, and car; his recurring association with knives; or his ever-changing stories about tussling with imaginary assailants. Fed. Appx., at –. The court instead focused on all the reasons why it thought Jones “could have” been a viable alternative suspect.E.g.,id., at –. And rather than engage with the “dissent[’s] recount[ing of] th[e] evidence” against Hines, the majority simply promised that it had “carefully considered” this proof before summarily dismissing it as “not overwhelming.”Id., at .Had the Sixth Circuit properly considered the entire record, it would have had little trouble deferring to the Tennessee court’s conclusion that Hines suffered no prejudice regarding his conviction or sentence. Again, the critical question was not whether the Sixth Circuititselfcould see a “ ‘substantial’ . . . likelihood of a different result” had Hines’ attorney taken a different approach.Cullen, U. S., at . All that mattered was whether theTennessee court, notwithstanding its substantial “latitude to reasonably determine that a defendant has not [shown prejudice],” still managed to blunder so badly that every fairminded jurist would disagree.Knowlesv.Mirzayance, U.S. , ().It did not. The Tennessee court reasonably looked to the substantial evidence of Hines’ guilt.Hines, WL , *–*. And it reasonably rejected the “ ‘farfetched’ ” possibility that Jones committed and self-reported a gruesome murder, in the presence of a witness, at a place where he was well known to the staff.Ibid.In light of this straightforward, commonsense analysis, the Sixth Circuit had no license to hypothesize an alternative theory of the crime in which Jones became a suspect years after the fact—much less rely on that fanciful theory to grant relief.[1]*Similarly untenable was the Sixth Circuit’s backstop theory that a more aggressive attorney could have changed the result by casting doubt on Jones’ credibility. Fed. Appx., at . As an initial matter, this conjecture ignores that Jones’ brief testimony about discovering the body did not indicate thatHineswas the culprit. Ample other evidence was what did that. Perhaps in light of this obvious disjuncture, the Sixth Circuit’s analysis of why an attack on Jones’ credibility would have been productive ultimately circled back to the majority’s main assumption “that Jones was a viable alternative suspect.”Id., at . Regardless, to the extent Jones’ credibility actually mattered, the jury already had several good reasons to be skeptical—for example, his peculiar tale of discovering the body; the insinuations of Hines’ attorney; and the discrepancies between Jones’ exact description of finding the body and the account of the first responders. None of these made a difference.IIIThe Sixth Circuit had no reason to revisit the decision of the Tennessee court, much less ignore the ample evidence supporting that court’s conclusion. We grant the petition for a writ of certiorari and respondent’s motion to proceedin forma pauperis, and we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.It is so ordered.[REDACTED] dissents.*Even on its own terms, there is little merit to the Sixth Circuit’s speculation that a jury who heard Jones’ full story might have blamed him instead of Hines. After all, the story Jones told at trial was in many waysmoresuspicious than the truth. According to his initial account, Jones fortuitously stopped by the motel, hung around outside, and then stumbled upon the body. All without a witness to verify his actions. The jury heard this tale—and Hines’ attorney stressed its oddities—yet found that Hines was the murderer. A federal court cannot now claim that the truth would have made a difference."}

Decided February , 2006Per Curiam.A private citizen seeks to attach an asset belonging to Iran’s Ministry of Defense in order to help satisfy a judgment for money damages. The question raised is whether the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of (FSIA or Act), U. S. C. §1602et seq.( ed. and Supp. III), forbids that attachment.The judgment for money damages consists of a default judgment against the Islamic Republic of Iran (for about $ million) that the private citizen, Dariush Elahi, obtained in a federal-court lawsuit claiming that the Republic had murdered his brother.Elahiv.Islamic Republic of Iran, F. Supp. 2d , (DC ). The asset is an arbitration award (against a third party), which Iran’s Ministry of Defense obtained in Switzerland.Ministry of Defense and Support for Armed Forces of Islamic Republic of Iranv.Cubic Defense Systems, Inc., F. 3d , ( ). The Ministry asked the Federal District Court for the Southern District of California to confirm the award.Ministry of Defense and Support for Armed Forces of Islamic Republic of Iranv.Cubic Defense Systems, Inc., F. Supp. 2d (). The court did so. And Elahi then intervened, seeking to impose a lien upon the award. The Ministry opposed the attachment on the ground that the Act grants it immunity from such a claim.The Federal District Court rejected the Ministry’s immunity defense on the ground that, by suing to enforce the award, the Ministry had waived any such immunity. On appeal the Ninth Circuit disagreed with the District Court about waiver. But it then found against the Ministry on a different ground—a ground that the parties had not argued. The Act says that under certain conditions the property of an “agency or instrumentality” of a foreign government is “not ... immune from attachment” if the agency is “engaged in commercial activity in the United States.” U. S. C. §(b) (emphasis added). The Court of Appeals found that the Ministry engages in commercial activity and that the other conditions were satisfied. F. 3d, at – (applying §(b)(2)). And it held that this section of the Act barred the Ministry’s assertion of immunity.Ibid.The Ministry filed a petition for certiorari asking us to review that decision. The Solicitor General agrees with the Ministry that we should grant the writ but limited to the Ministry’s Question 1, namely whether “the property of a foreign statestricto sensu,situated in the United States” is “immune from attachment ... as provided in the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act.” Pet. for Cert. i (citing §§(a), (a)). The Solicitor General also asks us to vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for consideration of whether the Ministry is simply a “foreign state” (what the Ministry calls “a foreign statestricto sensu”) or whether the Ministry is an “agency or instrumentality” of a foreign state (as the Ninth Circuit held). Brief for United States asAmicus –. We grant the writ limited to Question 1.The Act, as it applies to the “property in the United States of aforeign state,” §(a) (emphasis added), doesnotcontain the “engaged in commercial activity” exception that the Ninth Circuit described. That exception applies only where the property at issue is property of an “agency or instrumentality”of a foreign state. Compare §(b) (“property ... of an agency or instrumentality of a foreign state engaged in commercial activity”) with §(a) (“property ... of a foreign stateused for a commercial activity”) (emphasis added). The difference is critical. Moreover, in the Solicitor General’s view a defense ministry (unlike, say, a government-owned commercial enterprise) generally is not an “agency or instrumentality” of a foreign state but an inseparable part of the state itself. Brief for United States asAmicus –; see alsoTransaero, Inc.v.La Fuerza Aerea Boliviana, F. 3d , (CADC ) (“hold[ing] that armed forces are as a rule so closely bound up with the structure of the state that they must in all cases be considered as the ‘foreign state’ itself, rather than a separate ‘agency or instrumentality’ of the state”).We shall not now determine whether the Solicitor General is correct about the status of the Ministry, for the Ninth Circuit did not address the question nor did the parties argue the matter before the Circuit. Neither can we fault the Ministry for that failure. As we said,supra, at 1, the District Court based its denial of immunity upon waiver. The parties’ Ninth Circuit briefs focused on matters not relevant here (such as the waiver question), with one exception. The exception consists of a footnote in Elahi’s brief mentioning the Act’s “agency and instrumentality” provision. That footnote, however, does not ask for affirmance on that basis; nor did it provide the Ministry with clear notice that a reply was necessary. Answering Brief of Appellee in No. – (), p. , n. (stating that “[i]f[the Ministry] is considered ‘an agency or instrumentality of a foreign state,’ rather than the foreign state itself, Mr. Elahi’s attachment still is valid” (emphasis added)).The Ninth Circuit said that it was free to affirm on “any ground supported by the record.” F. 3d, at , n. . But the court did not explain what in the record might demonstrate that the Ministry is an “agency or instrumentality” of the state rather than an integral part of the state itself. The court noted that“Elahi appears to concede” that the Ministry is an “agency and instrumentality,”id., at , n. , but any relevant concession would have to have come from the Ministry, not from Elahi, whose position the concession favors. Thus, in implicitly concluding that the Ministry was an “agency or instrumentality” of the Republic of Iran within the meaning of §(b), the Ninth Circuit either mistakenly relied on a concession by respondent that could not possibly bind petitioner, or else erroneously presumed that there was no relevant distinction between a foreign state and its agencies or instrumentalities for purposes of that subsection. See §(a), (b). Either way, the Ninth Circuit committed error that was essential to its judgment in favor of respondent.Because the Ninth Circuit did not consider, and the Ministry had no reasonable opportunity to argue, the critical legal point we have mentioned, we vacate the judgment of the Ninth Circuit, and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered."}
{"file_name": "per curiam_2010_43_559.json", "author": "per curiam", "year": 2010, "text": "–. Decided February , 2010Per Curiam.This case presents the question whether any decision of this Court “clearly establishes” that a judge, in ruling on an objection to a peremptory challenge underBatsonv.Kentucky, U. S. (), must reject a demeanor-based explanation for the challenge unless the judge personally observed and recalls the aspect of the prospective juror’s demeanor on which the explanation is based. The Court of Appeals appears to have concluded that eitherBatsonitself orSnyderv.Louisiana, U. S. (), clearly established such a rule, but the Court of Appeals read far too much into those decisions, and its holding, if allowed to stand, would have important implications. We therefore grant the petition for certiorari, grant respondent’s motion to proceedin forma pauperis, and reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.IRespondent was tried in a Texas state court for the murder of a police officer, and the State sought the death penalty. Duringvoir dire, two judges presided at different stages. Judge Harper presided when the attorneys questioned the prospective jurors individually, but Judge Wallace took over when peremptory challenges were exercised. When the prosecutor struck an African-American juror named Owens, respondent’s attorney raised aBatsonobjection. Judge Wallace determined that respondent had made out a prima facie case underBatson, and the prosecutor then offered a race-neutral explanation that was based on Owens’ demeanor during individual questioning. Specifically, the prosecutor asserted that Owens’ demeanor had been “somewhat humorous” and not “serious” and that her “body language” had belied her “true feeling.” App. to Pet. for Cert. . Based on his observations of Owens during questioning by respondent’s attorney, the prosecutor stated, he believed that she “had a predisposition” and would not look at the possibility of imposing a death sentence “in a neutral fashion.”Id.,at . Respondent’s attorney did not dispute the prosecutor’s characterization of Owens’ demeanor, but he asserted that her answers on the jury questionnaire “show[ed] that she was a juror who [was] leaning towards the State’s case.”Ibid.After considering the prosecutor’s explanation and the arguments of defense counsel, Judge Wallace stated that the prosecutor’s reason for the strike was “race-neutral” and denied theBatsonobjection without further explanation.Id.,at .The case proceeded to trial, respondent was convicted and sentenced to death, and the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the conviction. Rejecting respondent’s argument that “a trial judge who did not witness the actual voir dire cannot, as a matter of law, fairly evaluate aBatsonchallenge,”id.,at , the Court of Criminal Appeals wrote:“There are many factors which a trial judge—even one who did not preside over the voir dire examinations—can consider in determining whether the opponent of the peremptory strikes has met his burden. These include the nature and strength of the parties’ arguments during theBatsonhearing and the attorneys’ demeanor and credibility. And, when necessary, a trial judge who has not witnessed the voir dire may refer to the record,”id.,at – (footnote omitted).With respect to the strike of juror Owens, the court held that Judge Wallace’s acceptance of the prosecutor’s explanation was not clearly erroneous and noted that “[t]he record does reflect that Owens was congenial and easygoing during voir dire and that her attitude was less formal than that of other veniremembers.”Id., at . This Court denied respondent’s petition for a writ of certiorari.Haynesv.Texas, U. S. ().After the Texas courts denied his application for state habeas relief, respondent filed a federal habeas petition. The District Court denied the petition and observed that this Court had never held that the deference to state-court factual determinations that is mandated by the federal habeas statute is inapplicable when the judge ruling on aBatsonobjection did not observe the jury selection. App. to Pet. for Cert. , n. .A panel of the Court of Appeals granted a certificate of appealability with respect to respondent’sBatsonobjections concerning Owens and one other prospective juror.Haynesv.Quarterman, F. 3d , ( ).In its opinion granting the certificate, the panel discussed our opinion inSnyderat length and then concluded:“UnderSnyder’s application ofBatson,... an appellate court applyingBatsonarguably should find clear error when the record reflects that the trial court was not able to verify the aspect of the juror’s demeanor upon which the prosecutor based his or her peremptory challenge.” F. 3d, at .When the same panel later ruled on the merits of respondent’sBatsonclaim regarding juror Owens,[Footnote 1] the court adopted the rule that it had previously termed “arguabl[e].” See F. 3d, at ;Haynesv.Quarterman, F. 3d , ( ). The court concluded that the decisions of the state courts were not owed “AEDPA deference” in this case “because the state courts engaged in pure appellate fact-finding for an issue that turns entirely on demeanor.”Ibid. The court then held that“no court, including ours, can now engage in a proper adjudication of the defendant’s demeanor-basedBatsonchallenge as to prospective juror Owens because we will be relying solely on a paper record and would thereby contraveneBatsonand its clearly-established ‘factual inquiry’ requirement.See,e.g.,Snyder, [ U. S., at ];Batson, [ U. S., at ].”Ibid.(footnote omitted).IIRespondent cannot obtain federal habeas relief under U. S. C. §(d)(1) unless he can show that the decision of the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals “was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court.” A legal principle is “clearly established” within the meaning of this provision only when it is embodied in a holding of this Court. SeeCareyv.Musladin, U. S. , ();Williamsv.Taylor, U. S. , (). Under §(d)(1), a habeas petitioner may obtain relief (1) “if the state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by this Court on a question of law or if the state court decides a case differently than this Court has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts”; or (2) “if the state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from this Court’s decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner’s case.”Id.,at .IIIIn holding that respondent is entitled to a new trial, the Court of Appeals cited two decisions of this Court,BatsonandSnyder, but neither of these cases held that a demeanor-based explanation for a peremptory challenge must be rejected unless the judge personally observed and recalls the relevant aspect of the prospective juror’s demeanor.The Court of Appeals appears to have concluded thatBatsonsupports its decision becauseBatsonrequires a judge ruling on an objection to a peremptory challenge to “ ‘undertake “a sensitive inquiry into such circumstantial and direct evidence of intent as may be available.” ’ ” F. 3d, at (quotingBatson, U. S., at , in turn quotingArlington Heightsv.Metropolitan Housing Development Corp., U. S. , ()). This general requirement, however, did not clearly establish the rule on which the Court of Appeals’ decision rests.Batsonnoted the need for a judge ruling on an objection to a peremptory challenge to “tak[e] into account all possible explanatory factors in the particular case,” U. S., at (internal quotation marks omitted). See alsoMiller-Elv.Dretke, U. S. , ();Johnsonv.California, U. S. , (). Thus, where the explanation for a peremptory challenge is based on a prospective juror’s demeanor, the judge should take into account, among other things, any observations of the juror that the judge was able to make during thevoir dire. ButBatsonplainly did not go further and hold that a demeanor-based explanation must be rejected if the judge did not observe or cannot recall the juror’s demeanor.Nor did we establish such a rule inSnyder.[Footnote 2] In that case, the judge who presided over thevoir direalso ruled on theBatsonobjections, and thus we had no occasion to consider howBatsonapplies when different judges preside over these two stages of the jury selection process.Snyder, U. S., at –. The part ofSnyderon which the Court of Appeals relied concerned a very different problem. The prosecutor in that case asserted that he had exercised a peremptory challenge for two reasons, one of which was based on demeanor (i.e., that the juror had appeared to be nervous), and the trial judge overruled theBatsonobjection without explanation. U. S., at –. We concluded that the record refuted the explanation that was not based on demeanor and, in light of the particular circumstances of the case, we held that the peremptory challenge could not be sustained on the demeanor-based ground, which might not have figured in the trial judge’s unexplained ruling.Id.,at –. Nothing in this analysis supports the blanket rule on which the decision below appears to rest.The opinion inSnyderdid note that when the explanation for a peremptory challenge “invoke[s] a juror’s demeanor,” the trial judge’s “first hand observations” are of great importance.Id., at . And in explaining why we could not assume that the trial judge had credited the claim that the juror was nervous, we noted that, because the peremptory challenge was not exercised until some time after the juror was questioned, the trial judge might not have recalled the juror’s demeanor.Id., at . These observations do not suggest that, in the absence of a personal recollection of the juror’s demeanor, the judge could not have accepted the prosecutor’s explanation. Indeed,Snyderquoted the observation inHernandezv.New York, U. S. , () (plurality opinion), that the best evidence of the intent of the attorney exercising a strike is often that attorney’s demeanor. See U. S., at .Accordingly, we hold that no decision of this Court clearly establishes the categorical rule on which the Court of Appeals appears to have relied, and we therefore reverse the judgment and remand the case for proceedings consistent with this opinion. Our decision does not mandate the rejection of respondent’sBatsonclaim regarding juror Owens. On remand, the Court of Appeals may consider whether the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals’ determination may be overcome under the federal habeas statute’s standard for reviewing a state court’s resolution of questions of fact.It is so ordered.Footnote 1Because the panel held that the strike of Owens violatedBatson, the panel did not rule on the legitimacy of the other strike as to which a certificate of appealability had been issued.Haynesv.Quarterman, F. 3d , , n. 2 ( ).Footnote 2Even ifSnyderdid alter or add toBatson’s rule (as the Court of Appeals seems to have concluded),Snydercould not have constituted “clearly established Federal law as determined by” this Court for purposes of respondent’s habeas petition because we decidedSnydernearly six years after his conviction became final and more than six years after the relevant state-court decision.

The three questions presented concern whether the parents of the victim of that shooting may assert claims for damages against the agent underBivensv.Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, U. S. () ; whether the shooting violated the victim’s Fourth Amendment rights; and whether the agent is entitled to qualified immunity on a claim that the shooting violated the victim’s Fifth Amendment rights.Because this case was resolved on a motion to dismiss, the Court accepts the allegations in the complaint as true for purposes of this opinion. SeeWoodv.Moss, U. S., at ). On June 7, , Sergio Adrián Hernández Güereca, a -year-old Mexican national, was with a group of friends in the cement culvert that separates El Paso, Texas, from Ciudad Juarez, Mex-ico. Now all but dry, the culvert once contained the watersof the Rio Grande River. The international boundary runs down the middle of the culvert, and at the top of the embankment on the United States side is a fence. According to the complaint, Hernández and his friends were playing a game in which they ran up the embankment on the United States side, touched the fence, and then ran back down. At some point, Border Patrol Agent Jesus Mesa, Jr., arrived on the scene by bicycle and detained one of Hernández’s friends in United States territory as the friend ran down the embankment. Hernández ran across the international boundary into Mexican territory and stood by a pillar that supports a railroad bridge spanning the culvert. While in United States territory, Mesa then fired at least two shots across the border at Hernández. One shot struck Hernández in the face and killed him. According to the complaint, Hernández was unarmed and unthreatening at the time.The Department of Justice investigated the incident. The Department concluded that the shooting “occurred while smugglers attempting an illegal border crossing hurled rocks from close range at a [Customs and Border Patrol] agent who was attempting to detain a suspect.” Dept. of Justice, Office of Public Affairs, Federal Officials Close Investigation Into the Death of Sergio Hernandez-Guereca (Apr. , ), online at http://www.justice.gov /opa /pr /federal-officials-close-investigation-death-sergio-hernandez-guereca (as last visited June , ). “[O]n these particular facts,” the Department determined, “the agent did not act inconsistently with [Customs and Border Patrol] policy or training regarding use of force.”Ibid.The Department also declined to bring federal civil rights charges against Mesa. In the Department’s view, there was insufficient evidence that Mesa “acted willfully and with the deliberate and specific intent to do something the law forbids,” and, in any event, Hernández “was neither within the borders of the United States nor present on U. S. property, as required for jurisdiction to exist under the applicable federal civil rights statute.”Ibid.The Department expressed regret for the loss of life in the incident and pledged “to work with the Mexican government within existing mechanisms and agreements to prevent future incidents.”Ibid.Petitioners—Hernández’s parents—brought suit. Among other claims, petitioners brought claims against Mesa for damages underBivens, alleging that Mesa violated Hernández’s rights under the Fourth and Fifth Amendments. The United States District Court for the Western District of Texas granted Mesa’s motion to dismiss. A panel of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part. The panel held that Hernández lacked any Fourth Amendment rights under the circumstances, but that the shooting violated his Fifth Amendment rights.Hernandezv.United States, F. 3d , , ();id.,at – (Dennis, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment);id.,at (DeMoss, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). The panel also found “no reason to hesitate in extendingBivensto this new context.”Id.,at . And the panel held that Mesa was not entitled to qualified immunity, concluding that “[n]o reasonable officer would have understood Agent Mesa’s alleged conduct to be lawful.”Id.,at . Judge DeMoss dissented in part, arguing that Hernández lacked any Fifth Amendment rights under the circumstances.Id.,at –.On rehearing en banc, the Court of Appeals unanimously affirmed the District Court’s dismissal of petitioners’claims against Mesa. The en banc Court of Appeals first held that petitioners had failed to state a claim for a violation of the Fourth Amendment because Hernández was “a Mexican citizen who had no ‘significant voluntary connection’ to the United States” and “was on Mexican soil at the time he was shot.”Hernandezv.United States, F. 3d , ( ) (per curiam) (quotingUnited Statesv.Verdugo-Urquidez, U. S. , () ). As to petitioners’ claim under the Fifth Amendment, the en banc Court of Appeals was “somewhat divided on the question of whether Agent Mesa’s conduct violated the Fifth Amendment,” but was “unanimous” in concluding that Mesa was entitled to qualified immunity. F. 3d, at . The en banc Court of Appeals explained that “[n]o case law in , when this episode occurred, reasonably warned Agent Mesa” that “the general prohibition of excessive force applies where the person injured by a U. S. official standing on U. S. soil is an alien who had no significant voluntary connection to, and was not in, the United States when the incident occurred.”Ibid.Because the en banc Court of Appeals resolved petitioners’ claims on other grounds, it “did not consider whether, even if a constitutional claim had been stated, a tort remedy should be crafted underBivens.”Id.,at , n. 1 (Jones, J., concurring). Ten judges filed or joined five separate concurring opinions.Id.,at –.This Court granted certiorari. U. S. The Court now vacates the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remands for further proceedings.The Court turns first to theBivensquestion, which is “antecedent” to the other questions presented.Wood, U. S., at ). InBivens, this Court “recognized for the first time an implied right of action for damages against federal officers alleged to have violated a citizen’s constitutional rights.”Correctional Services Corp.v.Malesko, U. S. , () . ABivensremedy is not available, however, where there are “ ‘special factors counselling hesitation in the absence of affirmative action by Congress.’ ”Carlsonv.Green, U. S. , () (quotingBivens, U. S., at ). In the decision recently announced inZiglarv.Abbasi,ante, p.” Seeante, at –, –. “[T]he inquiry,” the Court explains, “must concentrate on whether the Judiciary is well suited, absent congressional action or instruction, to consider and weigh the costs and benefits of allowing a damages action to proceed.”Ante, at .The Court of Appeals here, of course, has not had the opportunity to consider how the reasoning and analysis inAbbasimay bear on this case. And the parties have not had the opportunity to brief and argue its significance. In these circumstances, it is appropriate for the Court of Appeals, rather than this Court, to address theBivensquestion in the first instance. This Court, after all, is one “ ‘of review, not of first view.’ ”Expressions Hair Designv.Schneiderman, U. S., at ) (quotingNautilus, Inc.v.Biosig Instruments, Inc., U. S., at )).With respect to petitioners’ Fourth Amendment claim, the en banc Court of Appeals found it unnecessary to address theBivensquestion because it concluded that Hernández lacked any Fourth Amendment rights under the circumstances. This approach—disposing of aBivensclaim by resolving the constitutional question, while assuming the existence of aBivensremedy—is appropriate in many cases. This Court has taken that approach on occasion. See,e.g., at ). The Fourth Amendment question in this case, however, is sensitive and may have consequences that are far reaching. It would be imprudent for this Court to resolve that issue when, in light of the intervening guidance provided inAbbasi, doing so may be unnecessary to resolve this particular case.With respect to petitioners’ Fifth Amendment claim, the en banc Court of Appeals found it unnecessary to address theBivensquestion because it held that Mesa was entitled to qualified immunity. In reaching that conclusion, the en banc Court of Appeals relied on the fact that Hernández was “an alien who had no significant voluntary connection to . . . the United States.” F. 3d, at . It is undisputed, however, that Hernández’s nationality and the extent of his ties to the United States were unknown to Mesa at the time of the shooting. The en banc Court of Appeals therefore erred in granting qualified immunity based on those facts.“The doctrine of qualified immunity shields officials from civil liability so long as their conduct ‘does not violate clearly established . . . constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.’ ”Mullenixv.Luna, U. S., at 4–5) (quotingPearsonv.Callahan, U. S. , () ). The “dispositive inquiry in determining whether a right is clearly established is whether it would be clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted.”Saucierv.Katz, U. S. , () . The qualified immunity analysis thus is limited to “the facts that were knowable to the defendant officers” at the time they engaged in the conduct in question.Whitev.Pauly, U. S., at 3). Facts an officer learns after the incident ends—whether those facts would support granting immunity or denying it—are not relevant.Mesa and the Government contend that Mesa is entitled to qualified immunity even if Mesa was uncertain about Hernández’s nationality and his ties to the United States at the time of the shooting. The Government also argues that, in any event, petitioners’ claim is cognizable only under the Fourth Amendment, and not under the Fifth Amendment. This Court declines to address these arguments in the first instance. The Court of Appeals may address them, if necessary, on remand.The facts alleged in the complaint depict a disturbing incident resulting in a heartbreaking loss of life. Whether petitioners may recover damages for that loss in this suit depends on questions that are best answered by the Court of Appeals in the first instance.The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.[REDACTED] took no part in the consideration or decision of this case."}
{"file_name": "per curiam_2008_57_555.json", "author": "per curiam", "year": 2008, "text": "A conviction based on a general verdict is subject to challenge if the jury was instructed on alternative theories of guilt and may have relied on an invalid one. SeeStrombergv.California, U. S. ();Yatesv.United States, U. S. (). In this case the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that such an error is “structural error,” requiring that the conviction be set aside on collateral review without regard to whether the flaw in the instructions prejudiced the defendant. The parties now agree that the Court of Appeals was wrong to categorize this type of error as “structural.” They further agree that a reviewing court finding such error should ask whether the flaw in the instructions “had substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury’s verdict.”Brechtv.Abrahamson, U. S. , () (internal quotation marks omitted). We agree as well and so hold.Respondent Michael Pulido was convicted by a California jury of felony murder. On direct appeal, Pulido sought to vacate his conviction on the ground that the jury instructions were erroneous: They permitted the jury to find him guilty of felony murder if he formed the intent to aid and abet the underlying felony before the murder, but they also permitted the jury to find him guilty if he formed that intent only after the murder. The California Supreme Court agreed with Pulido that the latter theory was invalid under California law, but upheld the conviction on the ground that Pulido was not prejudiced by the error.Peoplev.Pulido, Cal. 4th , , P. 2d , – (). Pulido sought federal habeas relief, which the District Court granted after concluding that instructing the jury on the invalid theory had a “ ‘substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury’s verdict.’ ”Pulidov.Lamarque, No. C – CW (RR) (ND Cal., Mar. , ), App. to Pet. for Cert. 65a–66a (quotingBrecht,supra, at ).The State appealed and the Court of Appeals affirmed.Pulidov.Chrones, F. 3d ()(per curiam). On appeal, Pulido argued the District Court’sBrechtanalysis was correct, but in the alternative sought to avoid the harmless-error inquiry altogether. In support of that alternative argument, he maintained that when a jury returns a general verdict after being instructed on both a valid and an invalid theory, the conviction must be automatically set aside, without asking whether the invalid instruction was harmless. The Court of Appeals recognized that theBrecht“substantial and injurious effect” standard governs harmless-error analysis on federal habeas, F. 3d, at , n. 3 (internal quotation marks omitted), but agreed with Pulido that instructing a jury on multiple theories of guilt, one of which is legally improper, was “structural” error exempting the instructions as a whole from harmless-error review,id., at –. Such error instead required setting aside the conviction on habeas unless the reviewing court could determine with “absolute certainty” that the defendant was convicted under a proper theory.Id., at (citingLarav.Ryan, F. 3d , ( )). Because the instructions “le[ft] open the possibility” that the jury convicted Pulido on the impermissible ground, the court concluded that the verdict must be reversed. F. 3d, at . We granted certiorari. U. S.The Ninth Circuit precedent on which the Court of Appeals relied, seeLarav.Ryan,supra, based its structural-error analysis upon a line of our cases beginning withStromberg.Strombergaddressed the validity of a general verdict that rested on an instruction that the petitioner could be found guilty for displaying a red flag as “ ‘a sign, symbol, or emblem of opposition to organized government, or [a]s an invitation or stimulus to anarchistic action, or [a]s [a]n aid to propaganda that is of a seditious character.’ ” U. S., at . After holding that the first clause of the instruction proscribed constitutionally protected conduct, we concluded that the petitioner’s conviction must be reversed because “it [wa]s impossible to say under which clause of the [instruction] the conviction was obtained.”Id., at . InYatesv.United States,supra, we extended this reasoning to a conviction resting on multiple theories of guilt when one of those theories is not unconstitutional, but is otherwise legally flawed.BothStrombergandYateswere decided before we concluded inChapmanv.California, U. S. (), that constitutional errors can be harmless. Accordingly, neitherStrombergnorYateshad reason to address whether the instructional errors they identified could be reviewed for harmlessness, or instead required automatic reversal. In a series of post-Chapmancases, however, we concluded that various forms of instructional error are not structural but instead trial errors subject to harmless-error review. See,e.g.,Nederv.United States, U. S. 1() (omission of an element of an offense);Californiav.Roy, U. S. 2()(per curiam)(erroneous aider and abettor instruction);Popev.Illinois, U. S. () (misstatement of an element of an offense);Rosev.Clark, U. S. () (erroneous burden-shifting as to an element of an offense).Although these cases did not arise in the context of a jury instructed on multiple theories of guilt, one of which is improper, nothing in them suggests that a different harmless-error analysis should govern in that particular context. To the contrary, we emphasized inRosethat “while there are some errors to which [harmless-error analysis] does not apply, they are the exception and not the rule.”Id., at . AndNedermakes clear that harmless-error analysis applies to instructional errors so long as the error at issue does not categorically “ ‘vitiat[e]allthe jury’s findings.’ ” U. S., at (quotingSullivanv.Louisiana, U. S. , () (erroneous reasonable-doubt instructions constitute structural error)). An instructional error arising in the context of multiple theories of guilt no more vitiatesallthe jury’s findings than does omission or misstatement of an element of the offense when only one theory is submitted.In fact, drawing a distinction between alternative-theory error and the instructional errors inNeder,Roy,Pope, andRosewould be “patently illogical,” given that such a distinction “ ‘reduces to the strange claim that, because the jury ... received both a “good” charge and a “bad” charge on the issue, the error was somehow more pernicious than ... where theonlycharge on the critical issue was a mistaken one.’ ” F. 3d, at – (O’Scannlain, J., concurring specially) (quotingQuigleyv.Vose, F. 2d , ( )(per curiam)); see alsoBechtv.United States, F. 3d , ( ) (same), cert. denied, U. S. ().Pulido now agrees with the State that the Court of Appeals erred by treating the instructional error in this case as structural, and that the required prejudice analysis should be governed byBrecht’s “substantial and injurious effect” standard. See Brief for Respondent (“[t]he Ninth Circuit was mistaken in its ‘structural defect’ nomenclature”); Tr. of Oral Arg. (“We acknowledge that this is a trial error and is subject to the Brecht prejudice standard”). So do we.Pulido nonetheless maintains we should affirm because the Court of Appeals effectively engaged in theBrechtanalysis, despite its clear description of the error as “structural.” But despite full briefing on the applicability ofBrecht, the Court of Appeals mentionedBrechtonly briefly in a footnote, see F. 3d, at , n. 3, and then went on to agree with Pulido’s alternative assertion that “the instructional error was structural and therefore not subject to harmless error review,”id., at –. The court also stated that the conviction had to be overturned unless the court was “absolutely certain” that the jury relied on a valid ground.Id.,at . Such a determination would appear to be a finding that no violation had occurred at all, rather than that any error was harmless. In any event, an “absolute certainty” standard is plainly inconsistent withBrecht. Accordingly, we express no view on whether Pulido is entitled to habeas relief, but rather remand to the Court of Appeals for application ofBrechtin the first instance.*The judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.* The dissent maintains the Court of Appeals “undertook a searching review of the parties’ evidence and the jury instructions to determine the error’s effect on the jury.”Post, at 6 (opinion of Stevens, J.). But the Court of Appeals reached its conclusion based solely on the existence of a typographical error in the special circumstances instructions, without addressing any of the State’s arguments that the typographical error was harmless in light of the record as a whole. There was no need for that court to address those arguments, of course, because of its mistaken conclusion that the instructional error was structural. Under such circumstances, remand is the appropriate course."}

Decided June 4, 2018Per Curiam.Jane Doe, a minor, was eight weeks pregnant when she unlawfully crossed the border into the United States. She was detained and placed into the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), part of the Department of Health and Human Services. ORR placed her in a feder- ally funded shelter in Texas. After an initial medical exam- ination, Doe requested an abortion. But ORR did not allow Doe to go to an abortion clinic. Absent “emergency medical situations,” ORR policy prohibits shelter personnel from “taking any action that facilitates an abortion without direction and approval from the Director of ORR.” Plaintiff’s Application for TRO and Motion for Preliminary Injunction inGarzav.Hargan, No. –cv– (D DC), Dkt. No. 3–5, p. 2 (decl. of Brigitte Amiri, Exh. A). According to the Government, a minor may “le[ave] government custody by seeking voluntary departure, or by working with the government to identify a suitable sponsor who could take custody of her in the United States.” Pet. for Cert. ; see also 8 U. S. C. §1229c; 8 CFR §§.3, . ().Respondent Rochelle Garza, Doe’s guardian ad litem, filed a putative class action on behalf of Doe and “all other pregnant unaccompanied minors in ORR custody” challenging the constitutionality of ORR’s policy. Complaint inGarzav.Hargan, No. –cv– (D DC), Dkt. No. 1, p. . On October , , the District Court issued a temporary restraining order allowing Doe to obtain an abortion immediately. On October , Doe attended preabortion counseling, required by Texas law to occur at least hours in advance with the same doctor who performs the abortion. The clinic she visited typically rotated physicians on a weekly basis.The next day, a panel of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated the relevant portions of the temporary restraining order. Noting that the Government had assumed for purposes of this case that Doe had a constitutional right to an abortion, the panel concluded that ORR’s policy was not an “undue burden,”Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa.v.Casey, U. S. , () (plurality opinion).Four days later, on October , the Court of Appeals, sitting en banc, vacated the panel order and remanded the case to the District Court.Garzav.Hargan, F. 3d , – (CADC ). The same day, Garza sought an amended restraining order. Garza’s lawyers asked the District Court to order the Government to make Doe available “in order to obtain the counseling required by state law and to obtain the abortion procedure.” Pet. for Cert. (emphasis deleted). The District Court agreed and ordered the Government to act accordingly. Doe’s representatives scheduled an appointment for the next morning and arranged for Doe to be transported to the clinic on October at 7: a.m.The Government planned to ask this Court for emer- gency review of the en banc order. Believing the abortion would not take place until October after Doe had repeated the state-required counseling with a new doctor, the Government informed opposing counsel and this Court that it would file a stay application early on the morning of October . The details are disputed, but sometime over the course of the night both the time and nature of the appointment were changed. The doctor who had performed Doe’s earlier counseling was available to perform the abortion after all and the 7: a.m. appointment was moved to 4: a.m. At a.m., Garza’s lawyers informed the Government that Doe “had the abortion this morning.”Id., at (internal quotation marks omitted). The abortion rendered the relevant claim moot, so the Government did not file its emergency stay application. Instead, the Government filed this petition for certiorari.When “a civil case from a court in the federal system . . . has become moot while on its way here,” this Court’s “established practice” is “to reverse or vacate the judgment below and remand with a direction to dismiss.”United Statesv.Munsingwear, Inc., U. S. , (). Because this practice is rooted in equity, the decision whether to vacate turns on “the conditions and circumstances of the particular case.”United Statesv.Hamburg-Amerikanische Packetfahrt-Actien Gesellschaft, U. S. , (). One clear example where “[v]acatur is in order” is “when mootness occurs through . . . the ‘unilateral action of the party who prevailed in the lower court.’ ”Arizonans for Official Englishv.Arizona, U. S. , – () (quotingU. S. Bancorp Mortgage Co.v.Bonner Mall Partnership, U. S. , ()). “ ‘It would certainly be a strange doctrine that would permit a plaintiff to obtain a favorable judgment, take voluntary action that moots the dispute, and then retain the benefit of the judgment.’ ” U. S., at (alterations omitted).The litigation over Doe’s temporary restraining order falls squarely within the Court’s established practice. Doe’s individual claim for injunctive relief—the only claim addressed by the D. C. Circuit—became moot after the abortion. It is undisputed that Garza and her lawyers prevailed in the D. C. Circuit, took voluntary, unilateral action to have Doe undergo an abortion sooner than initially expected, and thus retained the benefit of that favorable judgment. And although not every moot case will warrant vacatur, the fact that the relevant claim here became moot before certiorari does not limit this Court’s discretion. See,e.g., LG Electronics, Inc.v.InterDigital Communications, LLC, U. S.Samish Indian Nation, U. S. () (after the certiorari petition was filed, respondent voluntarily dismissed its claim in the Court of Federal Claims);Eisai Co.v.Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc., U. S. () (before the certiorari petition was filed, respondent’s competitor began selling the drug at issue, which was the relief that respondent had sought);Indiana State Police Pension Trustv.Chrysler LLC, U. S. () (before the certiorari petition was filed, respondent completed a court-approved sale of assets, which mooted the appeal). The unique circumstances of this case and the balance of equities weigh in favor of vacatur.The Government also suggests that opposing counsel made “what appear to be material misrepresentations and omissions” that were “designed to thwart this Court’s review.” Pet. for Cert. . Respondent says this suggestion is “baseless.” Brief in Opposition . The Court takes allegations like those the Government makes here seriously, for ethical rules are necessary to the maintenance of a culture of civility and mutual trust within the legal profession. On the one hand, all attorneys must remain aware of the principle that zealous advocacy does not displace their obligations as officers of the court. Especially in fast-paced, emergency proceedings like those at issue here, it is critical that lawyers and courts alike be able to rely on one another’s representations. On the other hand, lawyers also have ethical obligations to their clients and not all communication breakdowns constitute misconduct. The Court need not delve into the factual disputes raised by the parties in order to answer theMunsingwearquestion here.The petition for a writ of certiorari is granted. The Court vacates the en banc order and remands the case to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit with instructions to direct the District Court to dismiss the relevant individual claim for injunctive relief as moot. SeeMunsingwear,supra.It is so ordered."}

{"file_name": "per curiam_2012_520_565.json", "author": "per curiam", "year": 2012, "text": "–. Decided February , 2012Per Curiam.James Lambert was convicted and sentenced to death in for the murder of two patrons during a robbery of Prince’s Lounge in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. One of the Commonwealth’s primary witnesses at Lambert’s trial was Bernard [REDACTED], who admitted to being involved in the robbery and identified Bruce Reese and Lambert as his accomplices. Almost years later, Lambert brought a claim for postconviction relief in Pennsylvania state court, alleging that the Commonwealth had failed to disclose,inter alia, a “police activity sheet” in violation ofBradyv.Maryland, U.S. (). This document, dated October , , noted that a photo display containing a picture of an individual named Lawrence Woodlock was shown to two witnesses to the Prince’s Lounge robbery, but that “[n]o identification was made.” Exh. 1, App. to Brief in Opposition. The document further noted that “Mr. WOODLOCK is named as co-defendant” by [REDACTED], who was in custody at the time on several charges and had admitted to involvement in at least armed robberies of bars.Ibid.The activity sheet did not indicate whether [REDACTED]’s reference was to the Prince’s Lounge crime or one of the others. The sheet bore the names of the law enforcement officers involved in the investigation of the Prince’s Lounge robbery. It also bore the names of the robbery’s murder victims, as well as the police case numbers for those murders. The Commonwealth has identified no evidence that Woodlock was ever investigated for any other robbery, or that his photo was shown to a witness in any other robbery.Lambert claimed that the activity sheet was exculpa-tory, because it suggested that someone other than or in addition to him, [REDACTED], and Reese was involved in the Prince’s Lounge crime.Commonwealthv.Lambert, Pa. , , A.2d , (). Lambert also argued that he could have used the activity sheet to impeach [REDACTED]’s testimony at trial, because the statement attributed to [REDACTED] suggested that [REDACTED] had identified Woodlock as a participant prior to identifying Lambert.Ibid.The Commonwealth countered that the asserted “statement” by [REDACTED] reflected in the activity sheet was in fact nothing more than an “ambiguously worded notation.”Ibid.The Commonwealth argued that this notation sim-ply indicated that [REDACTED] had named Woodlock as a “co-defendant” in some incident, without specifying whether Woodlock was said to be involved in the Prince’s Lounge robbery or one of the dozen other robberies in which [REDACTED] had admitted participating. In this regard, the Commonwealth noted that Woodlock’s name was not mentioned anywhere else in the police records, trial proceedings, or [REDACTED]’s statements about the Prince’s Lounge robbery. As the Commonwealth has put it, “it seems likely that [REDACTED] identified [Woodlock] as a participant in one of his manyotherrobberies, and police simply confirmed that Woodlock had nothing to do withthiscase.” Reply to Brief in Opposition 2. The Commonwealth “further note[d]” that the document would not have advanced any impeachment of [REDACTED], because he had already been extensively impeached at trial.Lambert, Pa., at , A. 2d, at . Thus, according to the Commonwealth, the “ambiguous reference to Woodlock” would not have discredited [REDACTED] any further.Ibid.The Pennsylvania Supreme Court agreed with the Commonwealth and unanimously rejected Lambert’sBradyclaim, holding that the disputed document was not material.Id.,at –, A. 2d, at –. The court concluded that there was no reasonable probability that the result of Lambert’s trial would have been different had the document been disclosed.Ibid.SeeStricklerv.Greene, U.S. , (). Calling Lambert’s claim that the reference to Woodlock “automatically” meant someone else was involved in the Prince’s Lounge robbery “purely speculative at best,” the court noted that “the police must not have had reason to consider Woodlock a potential codefendant in this case as his name is not mentioned anywhere else in the police investigation files.” Pa., at , A. 2d, at . “Moreover,” the court continued, the document “would not have materially furthered the impeachment of [REDACTED] at trial as he was already extensively impeached by both [Lambert] and Reese.”Ibid.Lambert filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania under U. S. C. §, claiming,inter alia, that the Commonwealth’s failure to disclose the document violated his rights underBrady. The District Court denied the writ, holding that the state courts’ determination that the notations “were not exculpatory or impeaching” was “reasonable.”Lambertv.Beard, Civ. Action No. – (July , ), App. to Pet. for Cert. , . The court explained that “[t]he various notations and statements which [Lambert] claims the Commonwealth should have disclosed are en-tirely ambiguous, and would have required the state courts to speculate to conclude they were favorable for Lambert and material to his guilt or punishment.”Id.,at .On appeal, however, the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed and granted the writ. F.3d (). The Third Circuit concluded that it was “patently unreasonable” for the Pennsylvania Supreme Court to presume that whenever a witness is impeached in one manner, any other impeachment evidence would be im-material.Id., at . According to the Third Circuit, the notation that [REDACTED] had identified Woodlock as a “co-defendant” would have “opened an entirely new line of impeachment” because the prosecutor at trial had relied on the fact that [REDACTED] had consistently named Lambert as the third participant in the robbery.Id.,at . The Commonwealth petitioned for certiorari.The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of (AEDPA) precludes a federal court from granting a writ of habeas corpus to a state prisoner unless the state court’s adjudication of his claim “resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.” U. S. C. §(d)(1). “Under §(d), a habeas court must determine what arguments or theories supported . . . the state court’s decision; and then it must ask whether it is possible fairminded jurists could disagree that those arguments or theories are inconsistent with the holding in a prior decision of this Court.”Harringtonv.Richter, U. S., at ).In this case, however, the Third Circuit overlooked the determination of the state courts that the notations were, as the District Court put it, “not exculpatory or impeaching” but instead “entirely ambiguous.” App. to Pet. for Cert. , . Instead, the Third Circuit focused solely on the alternative ground that any impeachment value that might have been obtained from the notations would have been cumulative. If the conclusion in the state courts about the content of the document was reasonable—not necessarily correct, but reasonable—whatever those courts had to say about cumulative impeachment evidence would be beside the point. The failure of the Third Circuit even to address the “ambiguous” nature of the notations, and the “speculat[ive]” nature of Lambert’s reading of them, is especially surprising, given that this was the basis of the District Court ruling.Id., at .[1]The Court of Appeals ordered that Lambert, convicted of capital murder nearly years ago, be set free unless the Commonwealth retried him within days. It did so because of a police activity sheet noting that [REDACTED] had identified Woodlock as a “co-defendant,” and bearing other information associating the sheet with the Prince’s Lounge robbery. The Court of Appeals, however, failed to address the state court ruling that the reference to Woodlock was ambiguous and any connection to the Prince’s Lounge robbery speculative. That ruling—on which we do not now opine—may well be reasonable, given that (1) the activity sheet did not explicitly link Woodlock to the Prince’s Lounge robbery, (2) [REDACTED] had committed a dozen other such robberies, (3) [REDACTED] was being held on several charges when the activity sheet was prepared, (4) Woodlock’s name appeared nowhere else in the Prince’s Lounge files, and (5) the two witnesses from the Prince’s Lounge robbery who were shown Woodlock’s photo didnotidentify him as involved in that crime.Any retrial here would take placethreedecadesafter the crime, posing the most daunting difficulties for the prosecution. That burden should not be imposed unlesseachground supporting the state court decision is examined and found to be unreasonable under AEDPA.The petition for certiorari and respondent’s motion to proceedin forma pauperisare granted. The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit is vacated, and the case is remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.Notes1The dissent emphasizes that the activity sheet was prepared for the investigation into the Prince’s Lounge crime.Post, at 1 (opinion of [REDACTED], J.). No one disputes that. The ambiguity at issue concerns whether [REDACTED]’sstatementreferred to that crime, or one of his many others. The dissent also finds “no suggestion” that the state courts believed [REDACTED]’s reference to Woodlock “contained the argued ambiguity.”Post, at 3. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court, however, recognized the Commonwealth’s argument that [REDACTED] could have named Woodlock as a codefendant in some other robbery, and concluded that “the Commonwealth accurately notes that the police must not have had reason to consider Woodlock a potential codefendant in this case as his name is not mentioned anywhere else in the police investigation files.”Commonwealthv.Lambert, Pa. , , A.2d , (). The only state court ruling the Third Circuit addressed—the conclusion that any impeachment evidence would have been cumulative—was one the state court introduced with “[m]oreover,” confirming that it was an alternative basis for its decision.Ibid.And the District Court certainly understood the state court decisions to have considered the reference ambiguous.

Readers are requested to notify the Reporter of Decisions, Supreme Court of the United States, Washington, D. C. , of any typographical or other formal errors, in order that corrections may be made before the preliminary print goes to press., – v.SHANNON PEREZ et alRICK PERRY, GOVERNOR OF TEXAS, et al., – v.WENDY DAVIS et al.RICK PERRY, GOVERNOR OF TEXAS, et al., – v.SHANNON PEREZ et al.appeal from the united states district court for the western district of texas[January , ]Per Curiam.The census showed an enormous increase in Texas’ population, with over four million new residents. That growth required the State to redraw its electoral districts for the United States Congress, the State Senate, and the State House of Representatives, in order to comply with the Constitution’s one-person, one-vote rule. See Georgia v. Ashcroft, U.S. , n. 2 (). The State also had to create new districts for the four additional congressional seats it received.Texas is a “covered jurisdiction” under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of . See 79Stat. , U. S. C. §1973c(a); CFR pt. , App. (). Section 5 suspends all changes to a covered jurisdiction’s election procedures, including district lines, until those changes are submitted to and approved by a three-judge United States District Court for the District of Columbia, or the Attorney General. See Northwest Austin Municipal Util. Dist. No. One v. Holder, U.S. , () . This process, known as preclearance, requires the covered jurisdiction to demonstrate that its proposed change “neither has the purpose nor will have the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color.” §1973c(a). This Court has been emphatic that a new electoral map cannot be used to conduct an election until it has been precleared. See, e.g., Clark v. Roemer, U.S. , () .The day after completing its new electoral plans, Texas submitted them to the United States District Court for the District of Columbia for preclearance. The preclearance process remains ongoing. Texas was unsuccessful in its bid for summary judgment, and a trial is scheduled in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, various plaintiffs—appellees here—brought suit in Texas, claiming that the State’s newly enacted plans violate the United States Constitution and §2 of the Voting Rights Act. [1] Appellees alleged, inter alia, that Texas’ enacted plans discriminate against Latinos and African-Americans and dilute their voting strength, notwithstanding the fact that Latinos and African-Americans accounted for three-quarters of Texas’ population growth since . A three-judge panel of the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas was convened. See U. S. C. §. That court heard argument and held a trial with respect to the plaintiffs’ claims, but withheld judgment pending resolution of the preclearance process in the D. C. court. Cf. Branch v. Smith, U.S. – () ([REDACTED], J., concurring).As Texas’ primaries approached, it became increasingly likely that the State’s newly enacted plans would not receive preclearance in time for the elections. And the State’s old district lines could not be used, because population growth had rendered them inconsistent with the Constitution’s one-person, one-vote requirement. It thus fell to the District Court in Texas to devise interim plans for the State’s primaries and elections. See Connor v. Finch, U.S. – (). After receiving proposals from the parties and holding extensive hearings, that court issued its interim plans. The court unanimously agreed on an interim State Senate plan, but Judge Smith dissented with respect to the congressional and State House plans. Texas asked this Court to stay the interim plans pending an appeal, arguing that they were unnecessarily inconsistent with the State’s enacted plans. This Court granted the stay and noted probable jurisdiction. U. S.Redistricting is “primarily the duty and responsibility of the State.” Chapman v. Meier, U.S. 1, () . The failure of a State’s newly enacted plan to gain preclearance prior to an upcoming election does not, by itself, require a court to take up the state legislature’s task. That is because, in most circumstances, the State’s last enacted plan simply remains in effect until the new plan receives preclearance. But if an intervening event—most commonly, as here, a census—renders the current plan unusable, a court must undertake the “unwelcome obligation” of creating an interim plan. Connor, supra, at . Even then, the plan already in effect may give sufficient structure to the court’s endeavor. Where shifts in a State’s population have been relatively small, a court may need to make only minor or obvious adjustments to the State’s existing districts in order to devise an interim plan.But here the scale of Texas’ population growth appears to require sweeping changes to the State’s current districts. In areas where population shifts are so large that no semblance of the existing plan’s district lines can be used, that plan offers little guidance to a court drawing an interim map. The problem is perhaps most obvious in adding new congressional districts: The old plan gives no suggestion as to where those new districts should be placed. In addition, experience has shown the difficulty of defining neutral legal principles in this area, for redistricting ordinarily involves criteria and standards that have been weighed and evaluated by the elected branches in the exercise of their political judgment. See, e.g., Miller v. Johnson, U.S. – (); White v. Weiser, U.S. – (). Thus, if the old state districts were the only source to which a district court could look, it would be forced to make the sort of policy judgments for which courts are, at best, ill suited.To avoid being compelled to make such otherwise standardless decisions, a district court should take guidance from the State’s recently enacted plan in drafting an interim plan. That plan reflects the State’s policy judgments on where to place new districts and how to shift existing ones in response to massive population growth. This Court has observed before that “faced with the necessity of drawing district lines by judicial order, a court, as a general rule, should be guided by the legislative policies underlying” a state plan—even one that was itself unenforceable—“to the extent those policies do not lead to violations of the Constitution or the Voting Rights Act.” Abrams v. Johnson, U.S. , () (holding that the District Court properly declined to defer to a precleared plan that used race as a predominant factor). For example, in White, supra, an equal population challenge, this Court reversed a District Court’s choice of interim plan, and required the District Court to choose a plan more closely resembling an enacted state plan, even though the state plan itself had been held to violate the one-person, one-vote principle. Similarly, in Upham v. Seamon, although the state plan as a whole had been denied §5 preclearance, this Court directed a District Court to “defer to the legislative judgments the [state] plans reflect,” insofar as they involved districts found to meet the preclearance standard. U.S. – () (per curiam). See also Whitcomb v. Chavis, U.S. – () (equal protection challenge).Section 5 prevents a state plan from being implemented if it has not been precleared. But that does not mean that the plan is of no account or that the policy judgments it reflects can be disregarded by a district court drawing an interim plan. On the contrary, the state plan serves as a starting point for the district court. It provides important guidance that helps ensure that the district court appropriately confines itself to drawing interim maps that comply with the Constitution and the Voting Rights Act, without displacing legitimate state policy judgments with the court’s own preferences.A district court making such use of a State’s plan must, of course, take care not to incorporate into the interim plan any legal defects in the state plan. See Abrams, supra, at –; White, supra, at . Where a State’s plan faces challenges under the Constitution or §2 of the Voting Rights Act, a district court should still be guided by that plan, except to the extent those legal challenges are shown to have a likelihood of success on the merits. Plaintiffs seeking a preliminary injunction of a statute must normally demonstrate that they are likely to succeed on the merits of their challenge to that law. See Winter v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., U.S. 7, () . There is no reason that plaintiffs seeking to defeat the policies behind a State’s redistricting legislation should not also have to meet that standard. And because the local district court—here, the District Court for the Western District of Texas—will ultimately decide the merits of claims under §2 and the Constitution, it is well equipped to apply that familiar standard.The calculus with respect to §5 challenges is somewhat different. Where a State has sought preclearance in the District Court for the District of Columbia, §5 allows only that court to determine whether the state plan complies with §5. Consistent with that design, we have made clear that other district courts may not address the merits of §5 challenges. See, e.g., Perkins v. Matthews, U.S. , () . The local district court drafting an interim plan must therefore be careful not to prejudge the merits of the preclearance proceedings. The court should presume neither that a State’s effort to preclear its plan will succeed nor that it will fail.The need to avoid prejudging the merits of preclearance is satisfied by taking guidance from a State’s policy judgments unless they reflect aspects of the state plan that stand a reasonable probability of failing to gain §5 preclearance. And by “reasonable probability” this Court means in this context that the §5 challenge is not insubstantial. That standard ensures that a district court is not deprived of important guidance provided by a state plan due to §5 challenges that have no reasonable probability of success but still respects the jurisdiction and prerogative of those responsible for the preclearance determination. And the reasonable probability standard adequately balances the unique preclearance scheme with the State’s sovereignty and a district court’s need for policy guidance in constructing an interim map. This Court recently noted the “serious constitutional questions” raised by §5’s intrusion on state sovereignty. Northwest Austin, U. S., at . Those concerns would only be exacerbated if §5 required a district court to wholly ignore the State’s policies in drawing maps that will govern a State’s elections, without any reason to believe those state policies are unlawful.Appellees, however, contend that §5 demands exactly that. In their view, this Court’s precedents require district courts to ignore any state plan that has not received §5 preclearance. But the cases upon which appellees rely hold only that a district court may not adopt an unprecleared plan as its own. See Lopez v. Monterey County, U.S. 9() ; McDaniel v. Sanchez, U.S. () . They say nothing about whether a district court may take guidance from the lawful policies incorporated in such a plan for aid in drawing an interim map. Indeed, in Upham this Court ordered a District Court to defer to the unobjectionable aspects of a State’s plan even though that plan had already been denied preclearance.In this case, the District Court stated that it had “giv[en] effect to as much of the policy judgments in the Legislature’s enacted map as possible.” 1 App. . At the same time, however, the court said that it was required to draw an “independent map” following “neutral principles that advance the interest of the collective public good.” Id., at –. In the court’s view, it “was not required to give any deference to the Legislature’s enacted plan,” and it instead applied principles that it determined “place the interests of the citizens of Texas first.” Id., at . To the extent the District Court exceeded its mission to draw interim maps that do not violate the Constitution or the Voting Rights Act, and substituted its own concept of “the collective public good” for the Texas Legislature’s determination of which policies serve “the interests of the citizens of Texas,” the court erred.In proclaiming its ability to draw an interim map “without regard to political considerations,” the District Court relied heavily on Balderas v. Texas, No. 6:, U. S. Dist. LEXIS (ED Tex., Nov. , ) (per curiam), summarily aff’d, U.S. () . 1 App. . But in Balderas there was no recently enacted state plan to which the District Court could turn. Without the benefit of legislative guidance in making distinctly legislative policy judgments, the Balderas court was perhaps compelled to design an interim map based on its own notion of the public good. Because the District Court here had the benefit of a recently enacted plan to assist it, the court had neither the need nor the license to cast aside that vital aid.Some specific aspects of the District Court’s plans seem to pay adequate attention to the State’s policies, others do not, and the propriety of still others is unclear. For example, in drawing State House districts in North and East Texas, the District Court closely followed the State’s policies. See 1 App. ; 5 id., at –. Although Texas’ entire State House plan is challenged in the §5 proceedings, there is apparently no serious allegation that the district lines in North and East Texas have a discriminatory intent or effect. 1 id., at , n. 4. The District Court was thus correct to take guidance from the State’s plan in drawing the interim map for those regions. But the court then altered those districts to achieve de minimis population variations—even though there was no claim that the population variations in those districts were unlawful. Id., at , and n. 8. In the absence of any legal flaw in this respect in the State’s plan, the District Court had no basis to modify that plan. [2]The District Court also erred in refusing to split voting precincts (called “voter tabulation districts” in Texas) in drawing the interim plans. Id., at , –. That choice alone prevented the District Court from following the lead of Texas’ enacted plan—which freely splits precincts—in many areas where there were no legal chal-lenges to the plan’s details. See id., at –, , n. . The District Court was apparently motivated by a well-intentioned desire to save Texas the time and expense of reconfiguring precincts, and to ensure that the court’s interim plan could be implemented in time for the upcoming election. Id., at , –, . But the State’s plan accepted the costs of splitting precincts in order to accomplish other goals, and Texas law expressly allows recasting precincts when redistricting. See Tex. Elec. Code Ann. §. (West ). If a State has chosen to accept the burden of changing its precincts, and its decision to do so is otherwise lawful, there is no warrant for a district court to ignore the State’s decision. Of course, in this case it may well be that Texas will reexamine this issue in light of the exigencies caused by the impending election.The District Court also appears to have unnecessarily ignored the State’s plans in drawing certain individual districts. For example, the District Court drew an interim District that resembles neither the State’s newly enacted plan, nor the previous plan in effect prior to the census. The court said that it did so in response to alleged constitutional violations. 1 App. –. But the court did not say that those allegations were plausible, much less likely to succeed. Nor did the District Court rely on a finding that the relevant aspects of the state plan stood a reasonable probability of failing to gain §5 preclearance, see supra, at 6. Without such a determination, the District Court had no basis for drawing a district that does not resemble any legislatively enacted plan.The court’s approach in drawing other districts was unclear. The interim plan’s Congressional District , for example, disregards aspects of the State’s plan that appear to be subject to strong challenges in the §5 proceeding. See 3 id., at –; 5 id., at –. That much seems appropriate, but there are grounds for concern with the path the District Court followed from there. The court’s order suggests that it may have intentionally drawn District as a “minority coalition opportunity district” in which the court expected two different minority groups to band together to form an electoral majority. 1 id., at . The order is somewhat ambiguous on this point—some portions suggest that the court deliberately designed such a district, other parts suggest that it drew the district solely as a response to population growth in the area. Compare id., at – (“Because much of the growth that occurred in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex was attributable to minorities, the new district was drawn as a minority coalition opportunity district”), with id., at (“The Court has nowhere expressly sought to increase the performance of any opportunity district above benchmark”). If the District Court did set out to create a minority coalition district, rather than drawing a district that simply reflected population growth, it had no basis for doing so. Cf. Bartlett v. Strickland, U.S. 1– () (plurality opinion).Because it is unclear whether the District Court for the Western District of Texas followed the appropriate standards in drawing interim maps for the Texas elections, the orders implementing those maps are vacated, and the cases are remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.The judgment shall issue forthwith.It is so ordered.Notes1Section 2 prohibits “any State or political subdivision” from imposing any electoral practice “which results in a denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color.” U. S. C. §(a).2This Court has stated that court-drawn maps are held to a higher standard of acceptable population variation than legislatively enacted maps. See, e.g., Abrams v. Johnson, U.S. , () . But this Court has also explained that those “stricter standard[s]” are not triggered where a district court incorporates unchallenged portions of a State’s map into an interim map. Upham v. Seamon, U.S. – () (per curiam)."}

This is where the victim has lived since the sexual assault occurred.“Personal visits to the home of [A. S.’s] father. This is where the victim lived when the sexual assault occurred.“Personal conversations, in English and in Spanish, with the victim’s mother, father, and other family members.“Telephone calls, in English and in Spanish, to the vic- tim’s mother, father, and other family members.“Checks at the Office of the Medical Examiner of Cook County.“Checks at local hospitals.“Checks at the Cook County Department of Corrections.“Check at the victim’s school.“Check with the family of an old boyfriend of the victim.“Check with the Illinois Secretary of State’s Office.“[Department of] Public [A]id check.” Id., at –.The State also inquired at the Department of Public Health, the morgue, the Cook County Jail, the Illinois Department of Corrections, the Immigration Department, and the post office. See Exh. K, at E– to E–, E–; App. to Pet. for Cert. 18a. The State’s investigator was assisted in the search by a police detective and a victim’s advocate. The detective visited A. S.’s father’s home once and went to A. S.’s mother’s home—A. S.’s last-known residence—on numerous occasions, approximately once every three days, at different hours of the day and night. Exh. K, at to , . On one visit, A. S.’s mother told the victim’s advocate that A. S. could be staying with an ex-boyfriend in Waukegan, Illinois, miles away. Id., at to . The police detective visited the Waukegan address but was informed by the ex-boyfriend’s mother that she had not seen A. S. in several months and that A. S. was not staying with her or her son. Id., at to . The efforts to find A. S. continued until March , the day of the hearing on the State’s motion. Id., at .On a final visit to A. S.’s mother on the morning of March , the mother informed the police detective that A. S. had called approximately two weeks earlier and had said that she did not want to testify and would not return to Chicago. See id., at E–; F.3d , ( ). A. S.’s mother told the detective that she still did not know where A. S. was or how to contact her. Exh. K, at .The trial court granted the State’s motion and admitted A. S.’s earlier testimony. The trial court concluded that the State had “expended efforts that go way beyond due diligence,” id., at E–, and that A. S. “ha[d] made it impossible for anybody to find where she is . . . in spite of what I think are superhuman efforts to locate [her],” id., at E–. At Cross’ retrial, a legal intern from the State’s attorney’s office read A. S.’s prior, cross-examined testimony to the jury. According to the opinion below, the clerk’s reading of the prior testimony did not include the long pauses that occurred at the first trial, and the clerk read the transcript with a slight inflection. See F. 3d, at . The jury acquitted Cross of aggravated sexual assault but found him guilty of two counts of criminal sexual assault.On appeal, the Illinois Court of Appeals agreed that A. S. was unavailable because “[i]t is clear from her telephone conversation with her mother that she was not in the city” and “also evident that she was in hiding and did not want to be located.” Id., at 83a. The court found that the State had conducted a good-faith, diligent search to locate A. S., and that the trial court had properly allowed the introduction of A. S.’s cross-examined testimony from the first trial. The court, therefore, affirmed Cross’ convictions and sentence. The Supreme Court of Illinois denied Cross’ petition for leave to appeal, and we denied Cross’ petition for a writ of certiorari.Cross then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under U. S. C. § in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. Cross argued, among other things, that the state court had unreason- ably applied clearly established Supreme Court prece-dents holding that the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment precludes the admission of the prior testimony of an allegedly unavailable witness unless the prosecution made a good-faith effort to obtain the declarant’s presence at trial. The District Court denied Cross’ petition, but the Seventh Circuit reversed. According to the Seventh Circuit, the Illinois Court of Appeals was unreasonable in holding that the State had made a sufficient effort to secure A. S.’s presence at the retrial. The Seventh Circuit stressed the importance of A. S.’s testimony and the manner of her testimony at the first trial.In Barber v. Page, U.S. () , we held that “a witness is not ‘unavailable’ for purposes of the . . . confrontation requirement unless the prosecutorial authorities have made a good-faith effort to obtain his presence at trial.” Id., at –. In Barber, we held that a witness had not been unavailable for Confrontation Clause purposes because the State, which could have brought the witness to court by seeking a writ of habeas corpus ad testificandum, had “made absolutely no effort to obtain [his] presence . . . at trial” apart from determining that he was serving a sentence in a federal prison. Id., at ; see also id., at .We again addressed the question of witness unavailability in Ohio v. [REDACTED], U.S. () . In that case, we held, the State had discharged its “duty of good-faith effort.” Id., at . We noted that the prosecutor had spoken to the witness’ mother, who reported that she had no knowledge of her daughter’s whereabouts and “knew of no way to reach [her] even in an emergency.” Ibid. We also noted that the State had served five subpoenas in the witness’ name to her parents’ residence over a 4-month period prior to the trial. “ ‘The lengths to which the prosecution must go to produce a witness,’ ” the Court made clear, “ ‘is a question of reasonableness.’ ” Id., at (quoting California v. Green, U.S. , , n. () (Harlan, J., concurring)). We acknowledged that there were some additional steps that the prosecutor might have taken in an effort to find the witness, but we observed that “[o]ne, in hindsight, may always think of other things.” U. S., at . But “the great improbability that such efforts would have resulted in locating the witness, and would have led to her production at trial, neutralizes any intimation that a concept of reasonableness required their execution.” Id., at .In the present case, the holding of the Illinois Court of Appeals that the State conducted the requisite good-faith search for A. S. did not represent an unreasonable appli- cation of our Confrontation Clause precedents. Whether or not the state court went too far in characterizing the prosecution’s efforts as “superhuman,” the state court identified the correct Sixth Amendment standard and applied it in a reasonable manner.The Seventh Circuit found that the State’s efforts were inadequate for three main reasons. First, the Seventh Circuit faulted the State for failing to contact “A. S.’s current boyfriend—whom she was with just moments before the alleged assault—or any of her other friends in the Chicago area.” F. 3d, at . But the record does not show that any of A. S.’s family members or any other persons interviewed by the State provided any reason to believe that any of these individuals had information about A. S.’s whereabouts.Second, the Seventh Circuit criticized the State because it did not make inquiries at the cosmetology school where A. S. had once been enrolled, ibid., but the court’s own opinion observed that the information about A. S.’s enrollment at the cosmetology school after the mistrial was not “noteworthy” or “particularly helpful.” Ibid. Since A. S. had not attended the school for some time, Exh. K, at E–, there is no reason to believe that anyone at the school had better information about A. S.’s location than did the members of her family.Finally, the Seventh Circuit found that the State’s efforts were insufficient because it had neglected to serve her with a subpoena after she expressed fear about testifying at the retrial. A. S., however, had expressed fear about testifying at the first trial but had nevertheless appeared in court and had taken the stand. The State represented that A. S., although fearful, had agreed to testify at the retrial as well. F. 3d, at . We have never held that the prosecution must have issued a subpoena if it wishes to prove that a witness who goes into hiding is unavailable for Confrontation Clause purposes, and the issuance of a subpoena may do little good if a sexual assault witness is so fearful of an assailant that she is willing to risk his acquittal by failing to testify at trial.As we observed in [REDACTED], when a witness disappears before trial, it is always possible to think of additional steps that the prosecution might have taken to secure the witness’ presence, see U. S., at , but the Sixth Amendment does not require the prosecution to exhaust every avenue of inquiry, no matter how unpromising. And, more to the point, the deferential standard of review set out in U. S. C. §(d) does not permit a federal court to overturn a state court’s decision on the question of unavailability merely because the federal court identifies additional steps that might have been taken. Under AEDPA, if the state-court decision was reasonable, it cannot be disturbed.The petition for a writ of certiorari and Cross’ motion to proceed in forma pauperis are granted, and the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit isReversed.* The State’s motion does not mention the investigator’s March 3 visit with A. S.’s mother and brother, and the record in this case does not make entirely clear when A. S. disappeared and when the State’s attorney actually became aware of this fact. In any event, the parties do not dispute the facts in this case regarding the State’s efforts to locate A. S. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 17a."}
{"file_name": "per curiam_2017_16-992_582.json", "author": "per curiam", "year": 2017, "text": "–. Decided June , 2017Per Curiam.As this Court explained inObergefellv.Hodges, U. S.”Id., at ). In the decision below, the Arkansas Supreme Court considered the effect of that holding on the State’s rules governing the issuance of birth certificates. When a married woman gives birth in Arkansas, state law generally requires the name of the mother’s male spouse to appear on the child’s birth certificate—regardless of his biological relationship to the child. According to the court below, however, Arkansas need not extend that rule to similarly situated same-sex couples: The State need not, in other words, issue birth certificates including the female spouses of women who give birth in the State. Because that differential treatment infringesObergefell’s commitment to provide same-sex couples “the constellation of benefits that the States have linked to marriage,”id., at ), we reverse the state court’s judgment.The petitioners here are two married same-sex couples who conceived children through anonymous sperm donation. Leigh and Jana Jacobs were married in Iowa in , and Terrah and Marisa Pavan were married in New Hampshire in . Leigh and Terrah each gave birth to a child in Arkansas in . When it came time to secure birth certificates for the newborns, each couple filled out paperwork listing both spouses as parents—Leigh and Jana in one case, Terrah and Marisa in the other. Both times, however, the Arkansas Department of Health issued certificates bearing only the birth mother’s name.The department’s decision rested on a provision of Arkansas law, Ark. Code §–– (), that specifies which individuals will appear as parents on a child’s state-issued birth certificate. “For the purposes of birth registration,” that statute says, “the mother is deemed to be the woman who gives birth to the child.” §––(e). And “[i]f the mother was married at the time of either conception or birth,” the statute instructs that “the name of [her] husband shall be entered on the certificate as the father of the child.” §––(f)(1). There are some limited exceptions to the latter rule—for example, another man may appear on the birth certificate if the “mother” and “husband” and “putative father” all file affidavits vouching for the putative father’s paternity.Ibid.But as all parties agree, the requirement that a married woman’s husband appear on her child’s birth certificate applies in cases where the couple conceived by means of artificial insemination with the help of an anonymous sperm donor. See Pet. for Cert. 4; Brief in Opposition 3–4; see also Ark.Code §9––(a) () (“Any child born to a married woman by means of artificial insemination shall be deemed the legitimate natural child of the woman and the woman’s husband if the husband consents in writing to the artificial insemination”).The Jacobses and Pavans brought this suit in Arkansas state court against the director of the Arkansas Department of Health—seeking, among other things, a declaration that the State’s birth-certificate law violates the Constitution. The trial court agreed, holding that the relevant portions of §–– are inconsistent withObergefellbecause they “categorically prohibi[t] every same-sex married couple . . . from enjoying the same spousal benefits which are available to every opposite-sex married couple.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 59a. But a divided Arkansas Supreme Court reversed that judgment, concluding that the statute “pass[es] constitutional muster.” Ark. , S. W. 3d , . In that court’s view, “the statute centers on the relationship of the biological mother and the biological father to the child, not on the marital relationship of husband and wife,” and so it “does not run afoul ofObergefell.”Id.,at . Two justices dissented from that view, maintaining that underObergefell“a same-sex married couple is entitled to a birth certificate on the same basis as an opposite-sex marriedcouple.” S. W. 3d, at (Brill, C. J., concurring in part and dissenting in part); accord,id.,at (Danielson, J., dissenting).The Arkansas Supreme Court’s decision, we conclude, denied married same-sex couples access to the “constellation of benefits that the Stat[e] ha[s] linked to marriage.”Obergefell, U. S., at ). As already explained, when a married woman in Arkansas conceives a child by means of artificial insemination, the State will—indeed,must—list the name of her male spouse on the child’s birth certificate. See §––(f )(1); see also §9––;supra,at 2. And yet state law, as interpreted by the court below, allows Arkansas officials in those very same circumstances to omit a married woman’s female spouse from her child’s birth certificate. See S. W. 3d, at –. As a result, same-sex parents in Arkansas lack the same right as opposite-sex parents to be listed on a child’s birth certificate, a document often used for important transactions like making medical decisions for a child or enrolling a child in school. See Pet. for Cert. 5–7 (listing situations in which a parent might be required to present a child’s birth certificate).Obergefellproscribes such disparate treatment. As we explained there, a State may not “exclude same-sexcouples from civil marriage on the same terms and conditions as opposite-sex couples.” U. S., at ). Indeed, in listing those terms and conditions—the “rights, benefits, and responsibilities” to which same-sex couples, no less than opposite-sex couples, must have access—we expressly identified “birth and death certificates.”Id., at ). That was no accident: Several of the plaintiffs inObergefellchallenged a State’s refusal to recognize their same-sex spouses on their children’s birth certificates. SeeDeBoerv.Snyder, F. 3d , – ( ). In considering those challenges, we held the relevant state laws unconstitutional to the extent they treated same-sex couples differently from opposite-sex couples. See U. S., at ). That holding applies with equal force to §––.Echoing the court below, the State defends its birth-certificate law on the ground that being named on a child’s birth certificate is not a benefit that attends marriage. Instead, the State insists, a birth certificate is simply a device for recording biological parentage—regardless of whether the child’s parents are married. But Arkansas law makes birth certificates about more than just genetics. As already discussed, when an opposite-sex couple conceives a child by way of anonymous sperm donation—just as the petitioners did here—state law requires the placement of the birth mother’s husband on the child’s birth certificate. Seesupra,at 2. And that is so even though (as the State concedes) the husband “is definitively not the biological father” in those circumstances. Brief in Opposition 4.[1]* Arkansas has thus chosen to make its birth certificates more than a mere marker of biological relationships: The State uses those certificates to give married parents a form of legal recognition that is not available to unmarried parents. Having made that choice, Arkansas may not, consistent withObergefell, deny married same-sex couples that recognition.The petition for a writ of certiorari and the pending motions for leave to file briefs asamici curiaeare granted. The judgment of the Arkansas Supreme Court is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.* As the petitioners point out, other factual scenarios (beyond those present in this case) similarly show that the State’s birth certificates are about more than genetic parentage. For example, when an Arkansas child is adopted, the State places the child’s original birth certificate under seal and issues a new birth certificate—unidentifiable as an amended version—listing the child’s (nonbiological) adoptive parents. See Ark. Code §§––(a)(1), (b) (); Ark. Admin. Code ..1–5.5(a) (Apr. )."}
{"file_name": "per curiam_2010_34_559.json", "author": "per curiam", "year": 2010, "text": "–. Decided February , 2010Per Curiam.InHudsonv.McMillian, U. S. 1, 4 (), this Court held that “the use of excessive physical force against a prisoner may constitute cruel and unusual punishment [even] when the inmate does not suffer serious injury.” In this case, the District Court dismissed a prisoner’s excessive force claim based entirely on its determination that his injuries were “de minimis.” Because the District Court’s approach, affirmed on appeal, is at odds withHudson’s direction to decide excessive force claims based on the nature of the force rather than the extent of the injury, the petition for certiorari is granted, and the judgment is reversed.IIn March , petitioner Jamey Wilkins, a North Carolina state prisoner, filed suit in the United States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina pursuant to U. S. C. §. Wilkins’pro secomplaint alleged that, on June , , he was “maliciously and sadistically” assaulted “[w]ithout any provocation” by a corrections officer, respondent Gaddy.[Footnote 1] App. to Pet. for Cert. C–4. According to the complaint, Gaddy, apparently angered by Wilkins’ request for a grievance form, “snatched [Wilkins] off the ground and slammed him onto the concrete floor.”Ibid. Gaddy “then proceeded to punch, kick, knee and choke [Wilkins] until another officer had to physically remove him from [Wilkins].”Ibid. Wilkins further alleged that, “[a]s a result of the excessive force used by [Gaddy], [he] sustained multiple physical injuries including a bruised heel, lower back pain, increased blood pressure, as well as migraine headaches and dizziness” and “psychological trauma and mental anguish including depression, panic attacks and nightmares of the assault.”Ibid.The District Court, on its own motion and without a response from Gaddy, dismissed Wilkins’ complaint for failure to state a claim. Citing Circuit precedent, the court stated that, “[i]n order to state an excessive force claim under the Eighth Amendment, a plaintiff must establish that he received more than ade minimus[sic]injury.” No. 3:–cv– (WD NC, Apr. , ), pp. 1, 2 (citingTaylorv.McDuffie, F. 3d , ( );Rileyv.Dorton, F. 3d , ( ) (en banc); footnote omitted). According to the court, Wilkins’ alleged injuries were no more severe than those deemedde minimisin the Circuit’sTaylorandRileydecisions. Indeed, the court noted, Wilkins nowhere asserted that his injuries had required medical attention.In a motion for reconsideration, Wilkins stated that he was unaware that the failure to allege medical treatment might prejudice his claim. He asserted that he had been prescribed, and continued to take, medication for his headaches and back pain, as well as for depression. And he attached medical records purporting to corroborate his injuries and course of treatment.Describing reconsideration as “an extraordinary remedy,” the court declined to revisit its previous ruling. No. 3:–cv– (WD NC, Aug. , ), p. 1. The medical records, the court observed, indicated that some of Wilkins’ alleged injuries “were pre-existing conditions.”Id., at 3. Wilkins had sought treatment for high blood pressure and mental health issues even before the assault. The court acknowledged that Wilkins received an X ray after the incident “to examine his ‘bruised heel,’ ” but it “note[d] that bruising is generally considered ade minimus[sic]injury.”Id., at 4. The court similarly characterized asde minimisWilkins’ complaints of back pain and headaches. The court denied Wilkins leave to amend his complaint. In a summary disposition, the Court of Appeals affirmed “for the reasons stated by the district court.” No. – (, Jan. , ).IIIn requiring what amounts to a showing of significant injury in order to state an excessive force claim, the Fourth Circuit has strayed from the clear holding of this Court inHudson. Like Wilkins, the prisoner inHudsonfiled suit under § alleging that corrections officers had used excessive force in violation of the Eighth Amendment. Evidence indicated that the officers had punched Hudson in the mouth, eyes, chest, and stomach without justification, resulting in “minor bruises and swelling of his face, mouth, and lip” as well as loosened teeth and a cracked partial dental plate. U. S., at 4. A Magistrate Judge entered judgment in Hudson’s favor, but the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed, holding that an inmate must prove “a significant injury” in order to state an excessive force claim.Hudsonv.McMillian, F. 2d , ()(per curiam). According to the Court of Appeals, Hudson’s injuries, which had not required medical attention, were too “minor” to warrant relief.Ibid.Reversing the Court of Appeals, this Court rejected the notion that “significant injury” is a threshold requirement for stating an excessive force claim. The “core judicial inquiry,” we held, was not whether a certain quantum of injury was sustained, but rather “whether force was applied in a good-faith effort to maintain or restore discipline, or maliciously and sadistically to cause harm.” U. S., at 7; see alsoWhitleyv.Albers, U. S. , – (). “When prison officials maliciously and sadistically use force to cause harm,” the Court recognized, “contemporary standards of decency always are violated ... whether or not significant injury is evident. Otherwise, the Eighth Amendment would permit any physical punishment, no matter how diabolic or inhuman, inflicting less than some arbitrary quantity of injury.”Hudson, U. S., at 9; see alsoid., at – (Blackmun, J., concurring in judgment) (“The Court today appropriately puts to rest a seriously misguided view that pain inflicted by an excessive use of force is actionable under the Eighth Amendment only when coupled with ‘significant injury,’e.g., injury that requires medical attention or leaves permanent marks”).This is not to say that the “absence of serious injury” is irrelevant to the Eighth Amendment inquiry.Id., at 7. “[T]he extent of injury suffered by an inmate is one factor that may suggest ‘whether the use of force could plausibly have been thought necessary’ in a particular situation.”Ibid.(quotingWhitley, U. S., at ). The extent of injury may also provide some indication of the amount of force applied. As we stated inHudson, not “every malevolent touch by a prison guard gives rise to a federal cause of action.” U. S., at 9. “The Eighth Amendment’s prohibition of ‘cruel and unusual’ punishments necessarily excludes from constitutional recognitionde minimisuses of physical force, provided that the use of force is not of a sort repugnant to the conscience of mankind.”Ibid.(some internal quotation marks omitted). An inmate who complains of a “push or shove” that causes no discernible injury almost certainly fails to state a valid excessive force claim.Ibid.(quotingJohnsonv.Glick, F. 2d , ( )).Injury and force, however, are only imperfectly correlated, and it is the latter that ultimately counts. An inmate who is gratuitously beaten by guards does not lose his ability to pursue an excessive force claim merely because he has the good fortune to escape without serious injury. Accordingly, the Court concluded inHudsonthat the supposedly “minor” nature of the injuries “provide[d] no basis for dismissal of [Hudson’s] § claim” because “the blows directed at Hudson, which caused bruises, swelling, loosened teeth, and a cracked dental plate, are notde minimisfor Eighth Amendment purposes.” U. S., at .The allegations made by Wilkins in this case are quite similar to the facts inHudson, and the District Court’s analysis closely resembles the approachHudsondisavowed. Wilkins alleged that he was punched, kicked, kneed, choked, and body slammed “maliciously and sadistically” and “[w]ithout any provocation.” Dismissing Wilkins’ actionsU. S.onte, the District Court did not hold that this purported assault, which allegedly left Wilkins with a bruised heel, back pain, and other injuries requiring medical treatment, involvedde minimisforce. Instead, the court concluded that Wilkins had failed to state a claim because “he simply has not alleged that he suffered anything more than de minimus[sic]injury.” No. 3:–cv– (WD NC, Apr. , ), at 2.In giving decisive weight to the purportedlyde minimisnature of Wilkins’ injuries, the District Court relied on two Fourth Circuit cases. SeeRiley, F. 3d, at –;Taylor, F. 3d, at –. Those cases, in turn, were based upon the Fourth Circuit’s earlier decision inNormanv.Taylor, F. 3d () (en banc), which approved the practice of using injury as a proxy for force. According to the Fourth Circuit,Hudson“does not foreclose and indeed is consistent with [the] view ... that, absent the most extraordinary circumstances, a plaintiff cannot prevail on an Eighth Amendment excessive force claim if his injuries arede minimis.” F. 3d, at .The Fourth Circuit’s strained reading ofHudsonis not defensible. This Court’s decision did not, as the Fourth Circuit would have it, merely serve to lower the injury threshold for excessive force claims from “significant” to “non-de minimis”—whatever those ill-defined terms might mean. Instead, the Court aimed to shift the “core judicial inquiry” from the extent of the injury to the nature of the force—specifically, whether it was nontrivial and “was applied ... maliciously and sadistically to cause harm.” U. S., at 7. To conclude, as the District Court did here, that the absence of “some arbitrary quantity of injury” requires automatic dismissal of an excessive force claim improperly bypasses this core inquiry.Id., at 9.[Footnote 2]In holding that the District Court erred in dismissing Wilkins’ complaint based on the supposedlyde minimisnature of his injuries, we express no view on the underlying merits of his excessive force claim. In order to prevail, Wilkins will ultimately have to prove not only that the assault actually occurred but also that it was carried out “maliciously and sadistically” rather than as part of “a good-faith effort to maintain or restore discipline.”Ibid. Moreover, even if Wilkins succeeds, the relatively modest nature of his alleged injuries will no doubt limit the damages he may recover.* * *The petition for certiorari and the motion for leave to proceedin forma pauperisare granted. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.Footnote 1The materials in the record do not disclose Gaddy’s full name.Footnote 2Most Circuits to consider the issue have rejected the Fourth Circuit’sde minimisinjury requirement. See,e.g.,Wrightv.Goord, F. 3d , – ( ) (“[O]ur Court has reversed summary dismissals of Eighth Amendment claims of excessive force even where the plaintiff’s evidence of injury was slight ... . [T]he absence of any significant injury to [the plaintiff] does not end the Eighth Amendment inquiry, for our standards of decency are violated even in the absence of such injury if the defendant’s use of force was malicious or sadistic”);Smithv.Mensinger, F. 3d , – ( ) (“[T]he Eighth Amendment analysis must be driven by the extent of the force and the circumstances in which it is applied; not by the resulting injuries. ...[D]e minimisinjuries do not necessarily establishde minimis force”);Oliverv.Keller, F. 3d , ( ) (rejecting the view “that to support an Eighth Amendment excessive force claim a prisoner must have suffered from the excessive force a more thande minimisphysical injury” (internal quotation marks omitted));United Statesv.LaVallee, F. 3d , ( ) (same).The Fifth Circuit has sometimes used language indicating agreement with the Fourth Circuit’s approach. See,e.g.,Gomezv.Chandler, F. 3d , () (“[T]o support an Eighth Amendment excessive force claim a prisoner must have suffered from the excessive force a more thande minimisinjury”). But seeBrownv.Lippard, F. 3d , () (“This Court has never directly held that injuries must reach beyond some arbitrary threshold to satisfy an excessive force claim”). Even in the Fifth Circuit, however, Wilkins likely would have survived dismissal for failure to state a claim because that court’s precedents have classified the sort of injuries alleged here as non-de minimis. See,e.g.,ibid.(permitting a prisoner’s Eighth Amendment excessive force claim to proceed to trial where evidence indicated that the prisoner suffered “one-centimeter abrasions on both his left knee and left shoulder, pain in his right knee, and tenderness around his left thumb,” as well as “back problems”);Gomez, F. 3d, at (refusing to grant summary judgment onde minimisinjury grounds where the prisoner alleged “physical pain [and] bodily injuries in the form of cuts, scrapes, [and] contusions to the face, head, and body”)."}

Decided April 2, 2018Per Curiam.Petitioner Andrew Kisela, a police officer in Tucson, Arizona, shot respondent Amy Hughes. Kisela and two other officers had arrived on the scene after hearing a police radio report that a woman was engaging in erratic behavior with a knife. They had been there but a few minutes, perhaps just a minute. When Kisela fired, Hughes was holding a large kitchen knife, had taken steps toward another woman standing nearby, and had refused to drop the knife after at least two commands to do so. The question is whether at the time of the shooting Kisela’s actions violated clearly established law.The record, viewed in the light most favorable to Hughes, shows the following. In May , somebody in Hughes’ neighborhood called to report that a woman was hacking a tree with a kitchen knife. Kisela and another police officer, Alex Garcia, heard about the report over the radio in their patrol car and responded. A few minutes later the person who had called flagged down the officers; gave them a description of the woman with the knife; and told them the woman had been acting erratically. About the same time, a third police officer, Lindsay Kunz, arrived on her bicycle.Garcia spotted a woman, later identified as Sharon Chadwick, standing next to a car in the driveway of a nearby house. A chain-link fence with a locked gate separated Chadwick from the officers. The officers then saw another woman, Hughes, emerge from the house carrying a large knife at her side. Hughes matched the description of the woman who had been seen hacking a tree. Hughes walked toward Chadwick and stopped no more than six feet from her.All three officers drew their guns. At least twice they told Hughes to drop the knife. Viewing the record in the light most favorable to Hughes, Chadwick said “take it easy” to both Hughes and the officers. Hughes appeared calm, but she did not acknowledge the officers’ presence or drop the knife. The top bar of the chain-link fence blocked Kisela’s line of fire, so he dropped to the ground and shot Hughes four times through the fence. Then the officers jumped the fence, handcuffed Hughes, and called paramedics, who transported her to a hospital. There she was treated for non-life-threatening injuries. Less than a minute had transpired from the moment the officers saw Chadwick to the moment Kisela fired shots.All three of the officers later said that at the time of the shooting they subjectively believed Hughes to be a threat to Chadwick. After the shooting, the officers discovered that Chadwick and Hughes were roommates, that Hughes had a history of mental illness, and that Hughes had been upset with Chadwick over a $ debt. In an affidavit produced during discovery, Chadwick said that a few minutes before the shooting her boyfriend had told her Hughes was threatening to kill Chadwick’s dog, named Bunny. Chadwick “came home to find” Hughes “somewhat distressed,” and Hughes was in the house holding Bunny “in one hand and a kitchen knife in the other.” Hughes asked Chadwick if she “wanted [her] to use the knife on the dog.” The officers knew none of this, though. Chadwick went outside to get $ from her car, which is when the officers first saw her. In her affidavit Chadwick said that she did not feel endangered at any time.Ibid.Based on her experience as Hughes’ roommate, Chadwick stated that Hughes “occasionally has episodes in which she acts inappropriately,” but “she is only seeking attention.” 2 Record .Hughes sued Kisela under Rev. Stat. §, U. S. C. §, alleging that Kisela had used excessive force in violation of the Fourth Amendment. The District Court granted summary judgment to Kisela, but the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed. F. 3d ().The Court of Appeals first held that the record, viewed in the light most favorable to Hughes, was sufficient to demonstrate that Kisela violated the Fourth Amendment. Seeid., at . The court next held that the violation was clearly established because, in its view, the constitutional violation was obvious and because of Circuit precedent that the court perceived to be analogous.Id., at . Kisela filed a petition for rehearing en banc. Over the dissent of seven judges, the Court of Appeals denied it. Kisela then filed a petition for certiorari in this Court. That petition is now granted.In one of the first cases on this general subject,Tennesseev.Garner, U. S. 1 () , the Court addressed the constitutionality of the police using force that can be deadly. There, the Court held that “[w]here the officer has probable cause to believe that the suspect poses a threat of serious physical harm, either to the officer or to others, it is not constitutionally unreasonable to prevent escape by using deadly force.”Id., at .InGrahamv.Connor, U. S. , () , the Court held that the question whether an officer has used excessive force “requires careful attention to the facts and circumstances of each particular case, including the severity of the crime at issue, whether the suspect poses an immediate threat to the safety of the officers or others, and whether he is actively resisting arrest or attempting to evade arrest by flight.” “The ‘reasonableness’ of a particular use of force must be judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, rather than with the / vision of hindsight.”Ibid.And “[t]he calculus of reasonableness must embody allowance for the fact that police officers are often forced to make split-second judgments—in circumstances that are tense, uncertain, and rapidly evolving—about the amount of force that is necessary in a particular situation.”Id., at –.Here, the Court need not, and does not, decide whether Kisela violated the Fourth Amendment when he used deadly force against Hughes. For even assuming a Fourth Amendment violation occurred—a proposition that is not at all evident—on these facts Kisela was at least entitled to qualified immunity.“Qualified immunity attaches when an official’s conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.”Whitev.Pauly, U. S., at 6) (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted). “Because the focus is on whether the officer had fair notice that her conduct was unlawful, reasonableness is judged against the backdrop of the law at the time of the conduct.”Brosseauv.Haugen, U. S. , () (per curiam).Although “this Court’s caselaw does not require a case directly on point for a right to be clearly established, existing precedent must have placed the statutory or constitutional question beyond debate.”White, U. S., at 6) (internal quotation marks omitted). “In other words, immunity protects all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.”Ibid.(internal quotation marks omitted). This Court has “ ‘repeatedly told courts—and the Ninth Circuit in particular—not to define clearly established law at a high level of generality.’ ”City and County of San Franciscov.Sheehan, U. S., at ) (quotingAshcroftv.al-Kidd, U. S. , () ); see alsoBrosseau,supra, at –.“[S]pecificity is especially important in the Fourth Amendment context, where the Court has recognized that it is sometimes difficult for an officer to determine how the relevant legal doctrine, here excessive force, will apply to the factual situation the officer confronts.”Mullenixv.Luna, U. S., at 5) (internal quotation marks omitted). Use of excessive force is an area of the law “in which the result depends very much on the facts of each case,” and thus police officers are entitled to qualified immunity unless existing precedent “squarely governs” the specific facts at issue.Id., at 6) (internal quotation marks omitted and emphasis deleted). Precedent involving similar facts can help move a case beyond the otherwise “hazy border between excessive and acceptable force” and thereby provide an officer notice that a specific use of force is unlaw- ful.Id., at ) (internal quotation marks omitted).“Of course, general statements of the law are not inherently incapable of giving fair and clear warning to officers.”White, U. S., at 7) (internal quotation marks omitted). But the general rules set forth in “GarnerandGrahamdo not by themselves create clearly established law outside an ‘obvious case.’ ”Ibid.Where constitutional guidelines seem inapplicable or too remote, it does not suffice for a court simply to state that an officer may not use unreasonable and excessive force, deny qualified immunity, and then remit the case for a trial on the question of reasonableness. An officer “cannot be said to have violated a clearly established right unless the right’s contours were sufficiently definite that any reasonable official in the defendant’s shoes would have understood that he was violating it.”Plumhoffv.Rickard, U. S., at ). That is a necessary part of the qualified-immunity standard, and it is a part of the standard that the Court of Appeals here failed to implement in a correct way.Kisela says he shot Hughes because, although the officers themselves were in no apparent danger, he believed she was a threat to Chadwick. Kisela had mere seconds to assess the potential danger to Chadwick. He was confronted with a woman who had just been seen hacking a tree with a large kitchen knife and whose behavior was erratic enough to cause a concerned bystander to call and then flag down Kisela and Garcia. Kisela was separated from Hughes and Chadwick by a chain-link fence; Hughes had moved to within a few feet of Chadwick; and she failed to acknowledge at least two commands to drop the knife. Those commands were loud enough that Chadwick, who was standing next to Hughes, heard them. This is far from an obvious case in which any competent officer would have known that shooting Hughes to protect Chadwick would violate the Fourth Amendment.The Court of Appeals made additional errors in concluding that its own precedent clearly established that Kisela used excessive force. To begin with, “even if a controlling circuit precedent could constitute clearly established law in these circumstances, it does not do so here., at ). In fact, the most analogous Circuit precedent favors Kisela. SeeBlanfordv.Sacramento County, F. 3d ( ). InBlanford, the police responded to a report that a man was walking through a residential neighborhood carrying a sword and acting in an erratic manner.Id., at . There, as here, the police shot the man after he refused their commands to drop his weapon (there, as here, the man might not have heard the commands).Id., at . There, as here, the police believed (perhaps mistakenly), that the man posed an immediate threat to others.Ibid.There, the Court of Appeals determined that the use of deadly force did not violate the Fourth Amendment.Id., at . Based on that decision, a reasonable officer could have believed the same thing was true in the instant case.In contrast, not one of the decisions relied on by the Court of Appeals—Deorlev.Rutherford, F. 3d ( ),Glennv.Washington County, F. 3d ( ), andHarrisv.Roderick, F. 3d ( )—supports denying Kisela qualified immunity. As forDeorle, this Court has already instructed the Court of Appeals not to read its decision in that case too broadly in deciding whether a new set of facts is governed by clearly established law.Sheehan, U. S., at –).Deorleinvolved a police officer who shot an unarmed man in the face, without warning, even though the officer had a clear line of retreat; there were no bystanders nearby; the man had been “physically compliant and generally followed all the officers’ instructions”; and he had been under police observation for roughly minutes. F. 3d, at , –. In this case, by contrast, Hughes was armed with a large knife; was within striking distance of Chadwick; ignored the officers’ orders to drop the weapon; and the situation unfolded in less than a minute. “Whatever the merits of the decision inDeorle, the differences between that case and the case before us leap from the page., at ).Glenn, which the panel described as “[t]he most analogous Ninth Circuit case,” F. 3d, at , was decided after the shooting at issue here. Thus,Glenn“could not have given fair notice to [Kisela]” because a reasonable officer is not required to foresee judicial decisions that do not yet exist in instances where the requirements of the Fourth Amendment are far from obvious.Brosseau, U. S., at , n. 4.Glennwas therefore “of no use in the clearly established inquiry.”Brosseau,supra,at , n. 4. Other judges brought this mistaken or misleading citation to the panel’s attention while Kisela’s petition for rehearing en banc was pending before the Court of Appeals. F.3d,at , n. 2 (Ikuta, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc). The panel then amended its opinion, but nevertheless still attempted to “rely onGlennas illustrative, not as indicative of the clearly established law in .”Id., at , n. 2 (majority opinion). The panel failed to explain the difference between “illustrative” and “indicative” precedent, and none is apparent.The amended opinion also asserted, for the first time and without explanation, that the Court of Appeals’ decision inHarrisclearly established that the shooting here was unconstitutional.Id., at . The new mention ofHarrisreplaced a reference in the panel’s first opinion toGlenn—the case that postdated the shooting at issue here. Compare F. 3d , ( ) (“As indicated byGlennandDeorle, . . . that right was clearly established”), with F. 3d, at (“As indicated byDeorleandHarris, . . . that right was clearly established”).The panel’s reliance onHarris“does not pass the straight-face test.” F. 3d, at (opinion of Ikuta, J.). InHarris, the Court of Appeals determined that an FBI sniper, who was positioned safely on a hilltop, used excessive force when he shot a man in the back while the man was retreating to a cabin during what has been referred to as the Ruby Ridge standoff. F. 3d, at –. Suffice it to say, a reasonable police officer could miss the connection between the situation confronting the sniper at Ruby Ridge and the situation confronting Kisela in Hughes’ front yard.For these reasons, the petition for certiorari is granted; the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed; and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered."}

Rollice was in her garage, she explained, and he was intoxicated and would not leave. Joy requested police assistance; otherwise, “it’s going to get ugly real quick.” F.3d , ( ). The dispatcher asked whether Rollice lived at the residence. Joy said he did not but explained that he kept tools in her garage.Officers Josh Girdner, Chase Reed, and Brandon Vick responded to the call. All three knew that Rollice was Joy’s ex-husband, was intoxicated, and would not leave her home.Joy met the officers out front and led them to the side entrance of the garage. There the officers encountered Rollice and began speaking with him in the doorway. Rollice expressed concern that the officers intended to take him to jail; Officer Girdner told him that they were simply trying to get him a ride. Rollice began fidgeting with something in his hands and the officers noticed that he appeared nervous. Officer Girdner asked if he could pat Rollice down for weapons. Rollice refused.Police body-camera video captured what happened next. As the conversation continued, Officer Girdner gestured with his hands and took one step toward the doorway, causing Rollice to take one step back. Rollice, still conversing with the officers, turned around and walked toward the back of the garage where his tools were hanging over a workbench. Officer Girdner followed, the others close behind. No officer was within six feet of Rollice. The video is silent, but the officers stated that they ordered Rollice to stop. Rollice kept walking. He then grabbed a hammer from the back wall over the workbench and turned around to face the officers. Rollice grasped the handle of the hammer with both hands, as if preparing to swing a baseball bat, and pulled it up to shoulder level. The officers backed up, drawing their guns. At this point the video is no longer silent, and the officers can be heard yelling at Rollice to drop the hammer.He did not. Instead, Rollice took a few steps to his right, coming out from behind a piece of furniture so that he had an unobstructed path to Officer Girdner. He then raised the hammer higher back behind his head and took a stance as if he was about to throw the hammer or charge at the officers. In response, Officers Girdner and Vick fired their weapons, killing Rollice.Rollice’s estate filed suit against, among others, Officers Girdner and Vick, alleging that the officers were liable under U. S. C. §, for violating Rollice’s Fourth Amendment right to be free from excessive force. The officers moved for summary judgment, both on the merits and on qualified immunity grounds. The District Court granted their motion.Burkev.Tahlequah, WL , *6 (ED Okla., Sept. , ). The officers’ use of force was reasonable, it concluded, and even if not, qualified immunity prevented the case from going further.Ibid.A panel of the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit reversed. F. 3d, at . The Court began by explaining that Tenth Circuit precedent allows an officer to be held liable for a shooting that is itself objectively reasonable if the officer’s reckless or deliberate conduct created a situation requiring deadly force.Id.,at . Applying that rule, the Court concluded that a jury could find that Officer Girdner’s initial step toward Rollice and the officers’ subsequent “cornering” of him in the back of the garage recklessly created the situation that led to the fatal shooting, such that their ultimate use of deadly force was unconstitutional.Id.,at . As to qualified immunity, the Court concluded that several cases, most notablyAllenv.Muskogee, F.3d ( ), clearly established that the officers’ conduct was unlawful. F. 3d, at . This petition followed.We need not, and do not, decide whether the officers violated the Fourth Amendment in the first place, or whether recklessly creating a situation that requires deadly force can itself violate the Fourth Amendment. On this record, the officers plainly did not violate any clearly established law.The doctrine of qualified immunity shields officers from civil liability so long as their conduct “does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.”Pearsonv.Callahan, U.S. , (). As we have explained, qualified immunity protects “ ‘all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.’ ”District of Columbiav.Wesby, U. S., at –) (quotingMalleyv.Briggs, U.S. , ()).We have repeatedly told courts not to define clearly established law at too high a level of generality. See,e.g.,Ashcroftv.al-Kidd, U.S. , (). It is not enough that a rule be suggested by then-existing precedent; the “rule’s contours must be so well defined that it is ‘clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted.’ ”Wesby, U. S., at ) (quotingSaucierv.Katz, U.S. , ()). Such specificity is “especially important in the Fourth Amendment context,” where it is “sometimes difficult for an officer to determine how the relevant legal doctrine, here excessive force, will apply to the factual situation the officer confronts.”Mullenixv.Luna, U.S. 7, () (per curiam) (internal quotation marks omitted).The Tenth Circuit contravened those settled principles here. Not one of the decisions relied upon by the Court of Appeals—Estate of Ceballosv.Husk, F.3d ( ),Hastingsv.Barnes, Fed. Appx. ( ),Allen, F.3d , andSevierv.Lawrence, F.3d ( )—comes close to establishing that the officers’ conduct was unlawful. The Court relied most heavily onAllen. But the facts ofAllenare dramatically different from the facts here. The officers inAllenresponded to a potential suicide call by sprinting toward a parked car, screaming at the suspect, and attempting to physically wrest a gun from his hands. F. 3d, at . Officers Girdner and Vick, by contrast, engaged in a conversation with Rollice, followed him into a garage at a distance of 6 to feet, and did not yell until after he picked up a hammer. We cannot conclude thatAllen“clearly established” that their conduct was reckless or that their ultimate use of force was unlawful.The other decisions relied upon by the Court of Appeals are even less relevant. As forSevier, that decision merely noted in dicta that deliberate or reckless preseizure conduct can render a later use of force excessive before dismissing the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. See F. 3d, at –. To state the obvious, a decision where the court did not even have jurisdiction cannot clearly establish substantive constitutional law. Regardless, that formulation of the rule is much too general to bear on whether the officers’ particular conduct here violated the Fourth Amendment. Seeal-Kidd, U. S., at .Estate of Ceballos, decided after the shooting at issue, is of no use in the clearly established inquiry. SeeBrosseauv.Haugen, U.S. , , n. 4 () (per curiam). AndHastings, an unpublished decision, involved officers initiating an encounter with a potentially suicidal individual by chasing him into his bedroom, screaming at him, and pepper-spraying him. Fed. Appx., at . Suffice it to say, a reasonable officer could miss the connection between that case and this one.Neither the panel majority nor the respondent have identified a single precedent finding a Fourth Amendment violation under similar circumstances. The officers were thus entitled to qualified immunity.The petition for certiorari and the motions for leave to file briefsamici curiaeare granted, and the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.It is so ordered."}

Decided May , 2019Per Curiam.Indiana’s petition for certiorari argues that the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit incorrectly invalidated two new provisions of Indiana law: the first relating to the disposition of fetal remains by abortion providers; and the second barring the knowing provision of sex-, race-, or disability-selective abortions by abortion providers. See Ind. Code §§−−2−1.1(a)(1)(K), −−3−4(a), −− 4−4, −−4−5, −−4−6, −−4−7, −− 4−8, −−−4(d), −−−5 (). We reverse the judgment of the Seventh Circuit with respect to the first question presented, and we deny the petition with respect to the second question presented.IThe first challenged provision altered the manner in which abortion providers may dispose of fetal remains. Among other changes, it excluded fetal remains from the definition of infectious and pathological waste, §§−−−4(d), −−−5, thereby preventing incineration of fetal remains along with surgical byproducts. It also authorized simultaneous cremation of fetal remains, §−−3−4(a), which Indiana does not generally allow for human remains, §−−−(a). The law did not affect a woman’s right under existing law “to determine the final disposition of the aborted fetus.” §−−3−2(a).Respondents have never argued that Indiana’s law creates an undue burden on a woman’s right to obtain an abortion. Cf.Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa.v.Casey, U.S. , () (plurality opinion). Respondents have instead litigated this case on the assumption that the law does not implicate a fundamental right and is therefore subject only to ordinary rational basis review. SeePlanned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky,Inc. v.Commissioner of Indiana State Dept.of Health, F.3d , (). To survive under that standard, a state law need only be “rationally related to legitimate government interests.”Washingtonv.Glucksberg, U.S. , ().The Seventh Circuit found Indiana’s disposition law invalid even under this deferential test. It first held that Indiana’s stated interest in “the ‘humane and dignified disposal of human remains’ ” was “not . . . legitimate.” F. 3d, at . It went on to hold that even if Indiana’s stated interest were legitimate, “it [could not] identify a rational relationship” between that interest and “the law as written,” because the law preserves a woman’s right to dispose of fetal remains however she wishes and allows for simultaneous cremation.Ibid.We now reverse that determination. This Court has already acknowledged that a State has a “legitimate interest in proper disposal of fetal remains.”Akronv.Akron Center for Reproductive Health,Inc., U.S. , , n. (). The Seventh Circuit clearly erred in failing to recognize that interest as a permissible basis for Indiana’s disposition law. SeeArmourv.Indianapolis, U.S. , () (on rational basis review, “the burden is on the one attacking the legislative arrangement to negative every conceivable basis which might support it”). The only remaining question, then, is whether Indiana’s law is rationally related to the State’s interest in proper disposal of fetal remains. We conclude that it is, even if it is not perfectly tailored to that end. Seeibid.(the State need not have drawn “the perfect line,” as long as “the line actually drawn [is] a rational” one). We therefore uphold Indiana’s law under rational basis review.We reiterate that, in challenging this provision, respondents have never argued that Indiana’s law imposes an undue burden on a woman’s right to obtain an abortion. This case, as litigated, therefore does not implicate our cases applying the undue burden test to abortion regulations. Other courts have analyzed challenges to similar disposition laws under the undue burden standard. SeePlanned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky,Inc. v.Commissioner of Indiana State Dept.of Health, WL , *2−*3 (, June , ) (Wood, C. J., concurring in denial of rehearing en banc). Our opinion expresses no view on the merits of those challenges.IIOur opinion likewise expresses no view on the merits of the second question presented,i.e., whether Indiana may prohibit the knowing provision of sex-, race-, and disability- selective abortions by abortion providers. Only the Seventh Circuit has thus far addressed this kind of law. We follow our ordinary practice of denying petitions insofar as they raise legal issues that have not been considered by additional Courts of Appeals. See this Court’s Rule .* * *In sum, we grant certiorari with respect to the first question presented in the petition and reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals with respect to that question.

Decided December , 2015Per Curiam.A death sentence imposed by a Kentucky trial court and affirmed by the Kentucky Supreme Court has been overturned, on habeas corpus review, by the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. During the jury selection process, the state trial court excused a juror after concluding he could not give sufficient assurance of neutrality or impartiality in considering whether the death penalty should be imposed. The Court of Appeals, despite the substantial deference it must accord to state-court rulings in federal habeas proceedings, determined that excusing the juror in the circumstances of this case violated the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments. That ruling contravenes controlling precedents from this Court, and it is now necessary to reverse the Court of Appeals by this summary disposition.Warden Randy White is the petitioner here, and the convicted prisoner, Roger Wheeler, is the respondent.In October , police in Louisville, Kentucky, found the bodies of Nigel Malone and Nairobi Warfield in the apartment the couple shared. Malone had been stabbed nine times. Warfield had been strangled to death and a pair of scissors stuck out from her neck. She was pregnant. DNA taken from blood at the crime scene matched respondent’s. Respondent was charged with the murders.Duringvoir dire,Juror gave equivocal and inconsistent answers when questioned about whether he could consider voting to impose the death penalty. In response to the judge’s questions about his personal beliefs on the death penalty, Juror said, “I’m not sure that I have formed an opinion one way or the other. I believe there are arguments on both sides of the—of it.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 126a. When asked by the prosecution about his ability to consider all available penalties, Juror noted he had “never been confronted with that situation in a, in a real-life sense of having to make that kind of determination.”Id., at 131a. “So it’s difficult for me,” he explained, “to judge how I would I guess act, uh.”Ibid.The prosecution sought to clarify Juror ’s answer, asking if the juror meant he was “not absolutely certain whether [he] could realistically consider” the death penalty.Id., at 132a. Juror replied, “I think that would be the most accurate way I could answer your question.”Ibid.During defense counsel’s examination, Juror described himself as “a bit more contemplative on the issue of taking a life and, uh, whether or not we have the right to take that life.”Id., at 133a. Later, however, he expressed his belief that he could consider all the penalty options.Id., at 134a.The prosecution moved to strike Juror for cause based on his inconsistent replies, as illustrated by his statement that he was not absolutely certain he could realistically consider the death penalty. The defense opposed the motion, arguing that Juror ’s answers indicated his ability to consider all the penalty options, despite having some reservations about the death penalty. The judge said that when she was done questioning Juror , she wrote in her notes that the juror “ ‘could consider [the] entire range’ ” of penalties.Id., at 138a. She further stated that she did not “see him as problematic” at the end of her examination.Ibid. But she also noted that she did not “hear him say that he couldn’t realistically consider the death penalty,” and reserved ruling on the motion until she could review Juror ’s testimony.Ibid.The next day, after reviewing the relevant testimony, the judge struck Juror for cause. When she announced her decision to excuse the juror, the trial judge stated, “And when I went back and reviewed [the juror’s] entire testimony, [the prosecution] concluded with saying, ‘Would it be accurate to say that you couldn’t, couldn’t consider the entire range?’ And his response is—I think was, ‘I think that would be pretty accurate.’ So, I’m going to sustain that one, too.”Id., at 139a–140a.The case proceeded to trial. Respondent was convicted of both murders and sentenced to death. The Kentucky Supreme Court affirmed the convictions and the sentence.Wheelerv.Commonwealth, S. W. 3d , (). In considering respondent’s challenges to the trial court’s excusal of certain jurors for cause, the Kentucky Supreme Court held that the trial judge “appropriately struck for cause those jurors that could not impose the death pen-alty. . . . There was no error and the rights of the defendant to a fair trial by a fair and impartial jury . . . under both the federal and state constitutions were not violated.”Id.,at .After exhausting available state postconviction procedures, respondent sought a writ of habeas corpus under U. S. C. § from the United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky. He asserted,inter alia, that the Kentucky trial court erred in striking Juror duringvoir direon the ground that the juror could not give assurances that he could consider the death penalty as a sentencing option. The District Court dismissed the petition; but a divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed, granting habeas relief as to respondent’s sentence.Wheelerv.Simpson, F. 3d , (). While acknowledging the deferential standard required on federal habeas review of a state conviction, the Court of Appeals held that allowing the exclusion of Juror was an unreasonable application ofWitherspoonv.Illinois, U. S. () ,Wainwrightv.Witt, U. S. () , and their progeny. F. 3d, at –.Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of (AEDPA), habeas relief is authorized if the state court’s decision “was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.” U. S. C. §(d)(1). This Court, time and again, has instructed that AEDPA, by setting forth necessary predicates before state-court judgments may be set aside, “erects a formidable barrier to federal habeas relief for prisoners whose claims have been adjudicated in state court.”Burtv.Titlow, U. S., at 6). Under §(d)(1), “ ‘a state prisoner must show that the state court’s ruling on the claim being presented in federal court was so lacking in justification that there was an error well understood and comprehended in existing law beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.’ ”Whitev.Woodall, U. S., at 4) (quotingHarringtonv.Richter, U. S. , () ).The Court of Appeals was required to apply this deferential standard to the state court’s analysis of respondent’s juror exclusion claim. InWitherspoon, this Court set forth the rule for juror disqualification in capital cases.Witherspoonrecognized that the Sixth Amendment’s guarantee of an impartial jury confers on capital defendants the right to a jury not “uncommonly willing to condemn a man to die.” U. S., at . But the Court with equal clarity has acknowledged the State’s “strong interest in having jurors who are able to apply capital punishment within the framework state law prescribes.”Uttechtv.Brown, U. S. 1, 9 () . To ensure the proper balance between these two interests, only “a juror who is substantially impaired in his or her ability to impose the death penalty under the state-law framework can be excused for cause.”Ibid.As the Court explained inWitt, a juror may be excused for cause “where the trial judge is left with the definite impression that a prospective juror would be unable to faithfully and impartially apply the law.” U. S., at –.Reviewing courts owe deference to a trial court’s ruling on whether to strike a particular juror “regardless of whether the trial court engages in explicit analysis regarding substantial impairment; even the granting of a motion to excuse for cause constitutes an implicit finding of bias.”Uttecht, U. S., at 7.A trial court’s “finding may be upheld even in the absence of clear statements from the juror that he or she is impaired . . . .”Ibid.And where, as here, the federal courts review a state-court ruling under the constraints imposed by AEDPA, the federal court must accord an additional and “independent, high standard” of deference.Id., at . As a result, federal habeas reviewof aWitherspoon-Wittclaim—much like federal habeas review of an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim—must be “ ‘ “doubly deferential., at 1) (quotingCullenv.Pinholster, U. S. , () ).The Court of Appeals held that the Kentucky Supreme Court unreasonably appliedWitherspoon,Witt, and their progeny when it determined that removing Juror for cause was constitutional. F. 3d, at –. The Court of Appeals determined Juror “understood the decisions he would face and engaged with them in a thoughtful, honest, and conscientious manner.”Id.,at . In the Court of Appeals’ estimation, the trial judge concluded the juror was not qualified only by “misapprehending a single question and answer exchange” between Juror and the prosecution,id.,at —the exchange in which Juror stated he was not absolutely certain he could realistically consider the death penalty,id., at . According to the Court of Appeals, Juror “agreedhe did not knowto an absolute certainty whether he could realistically consider the death penalty, but the court proceeded as ifhe knew he could not.”Ibid. The Court of Appeals further determined that if the trial judge, when reviewing Juror ’s examination, had “properly processed that exchange” between Juror and the prosecution, Juror would not have been excused.Id.,at .Both the analysis and the conclusion in the decision under review were incorrect., at 4) (quotingHarrington,supra, at ).The Court of Appeals did not properly apply the deference it was required to accord the state-court ruling. A fairminded jurist could readily conclude that the trial judge’s exchange with Juror reflected a “diligent and thoughtfulvoir dire”; that she considered with care the juror’s testimony; and that she was fair in the exercise of her “broad discretion” in determining whether the juror was qualified to serve in this capital case.Uttecht, U. S., at . Juror ’s answers duringvoir direwere at least ambiguous as to whether he would be able to give appropriate consideration to imposing the death penalty. And as this Court made clear inUttecht, “when there is ambiguity in the prospective juror’s statements,” the trial court is “ ‘entitled to resolve it in favor of the State.’ ”Id., at 7 (quotingWitt,supra, at ).The Court of Appeals erred in its assessment of the trial judge’s reformulation of an important part of Juror ’s questioning. F. 3d, at . When excusing the juror the day after thevoir dire, the trial judge said that the prosecution had asked whether the juror “couldn’t con-sider the entire range” of penalties. App. to Pet. for Cert. 139a. The prosecution in fact asked if the juror was “not absolutely certain whether [he] could realistically con-sider” the entire range of penalties.Id., at 132a. The juror’s confirmation that he was “not absolutely certain whether [he] could realistically consider” the death penalty,ibid., was a reasonable basis for the trial judge to conclude that the juror was unable to give that penalty fair consideration. The trial judge’s decision to excuse Juror did not violate clearly established federal law by concluding that Juror was not qualified to serve as a member ofthis capital jury. SeeWitt,supra, at –. And similarly, the Kentucky Supreme Court’s ruling that therewas no error is not beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.The Court of Appeals noted that the deference toward trial courts recognized inUttecht“was largely premised on the trial judge’s ability to ‘observe the demeanor of’ ” the juror. F. 3d, at (quoting U. S., at ). It concluded that deference to the trial court here supported habeas relief, because the trial judge’s “initial assessment of [the juror’s] answers and demeanor” did not lead her to immediately strike Juror for cause. F. 3d, at –.The Court of Appeals’ conclusion conflicts with the meaning and holding ofUttechtand with a common-sense understanding of the jury selection process. Nothing inUttechtlimits the trial court to evaluating demeanor alone and not the substance of a juror’s response. And the implicit suggestion that a trial judge is entitled to less deference for having deliberated after her initial ruling is wrong. In the ordinary case the conclusion should be quite the opposite. It is true that a trial court’s contemporaneous assessment of a juror’s demeanor, and its bearing on how to interpret or understand the juror’s responses, are entitled to substantial deference; but a trial court ruling is likewise entitled to deference when made after a careful review of a formal transcript or recording. If the trial judge chooses to reflect and deliberate further, as this trial judge did after the proceedings recessed for the day, that is not to be faulted; it is to be commended.This is not a case where “the record discloses no basis for a finding of substantial impairment.”Uttecht,supra, at .The two federal judges in the majority below might have reached a different conclusion had they been presiding over thisvoir dire. But simple disagreement does not overcome the two layers of deference owed by a federal habeas court in this context.* * *The Kentucky Supreme Court was not unreasonable in its application of clearly established federal law when it concluded that the exclusion of Juror did not violate the Sixth Amendment. Given this conclusion, there is no need to consider petitioner’s further contention that, if there were an error by the trial court in excluding the juror, it should be subject to harmless-error analysis. And this Court does not review the other rulings of the Court of Appeals that are not addressed in this opinion.As a final matter, this Court again advises the Court of Appeals that the provisions of AEDPA apply with full force even when reviewing a conviction and sentence imposing the death penalty. See,e.g.,Parkerv.Matthews, U. S.Dixon, U. S.Mitts, U. S. () (per curiam);Bobbyv.Van Hook, U. S. 4 () (per curiam).The petition for certiorari and respondent’s motion to proceedin forma pauperisare granted.

S. , () (quotingRamdassv.Angelone, U. S. , () (plurality opinion)). In the decision below, the Arizona Supreme Court found that the State had put petitioner Shawn Patrick Lynch’s future dangerousness at issue during his capital sentencing proceeding and acknowledged that Lynch’s only alternative sentence to death was life imprisonment without parole. Ariz. , , P. 3d , (). But the court nonetheless concluded that Lynch had no right to inform the jury of his parole ineligibility.Ibid.The judgment is reversed.A jury convicted Lynch of first-degree murder, kidnapping, armed robbery, and burglary for the killing of James Panzarella. The State sought the death penalty. Before Lynch’s penalty phase trial began, Arizona moved to prevent his counsel from informing the jury that the only alternative sentence to death was life without the possibility of parole. App. K to Pet. for Cert. The court granted the motion.Lynch’s first penalty phase jury failed to reach a unanimous verdict. A second jury was convened and sentenced Lynch to death. On appeal, the Arizona Supreme Court vacated the sentence because the jury instructions improperly described Arizona law. The court did not address Lynch’s alternative argument that the trial court had violatedSimmons. On remand, a third penalty phase jury sentenced Lynch to death.The Arizona Supreme Court affirmed, this time considering and rejecting Lynch’sSimmonsclaim. The court agreed that, during the third penalty phase, “[t]he State suggested . . . that Lynch could be dangerous.” Ariz., at , P. 3d, at . The court also recognized that Lynch was parole ineligible: Under Arizona law, “parole is available only to individuals who committed a felony before January 1, ,” and Lynch committed his crimes in .Ibid.(citing Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §–.(I)). Nevertheless, while “[a]n instruction that parole is not currently available would be correct,” the court held that “the failure to give theSimmonsinstruction was not error.” Ariz., at , P. 3d, at .That conclusion conflicts with this Court’s precedents. InSimmons, as here, a capital defendant was ineligible for parole under state law. U. S., at (plurality opinion). During the penalty phase, the State argued that the jurors should consider the defendant’s future dangerousness when determining the proper punishment.Id., at . But the trial court refused to permit defense counsel to tell the jury that the only alternative sentence to death was life without parole.Id.,at , . The Court reversed, reasoning that due process entitled the defendant to rebut the prosecution’s argument that he posed a future danger by informing his sentencing jury that he is parole ineligible.Id., at –;id., at (O’Connor, J., concurring in judgment). The Court’s opinions reiterated that holding inRamdass,Shafer, andKellyv.South Carolina, U. S.

It relied on the fact that, under state law, Lynch could have received a life sentence that would have made him eligible for “release” after years. Ariz., at –, P. 3d, at –; §–(A). But under state law, the only kind of release for which Lynch would have been eligible—as the State does not contest—is executive clemency. See Pet. for Cert. ; Ariz., at –, P. 3d, at –. AndSimmonsexpressly rejected the argument that the possibility of clemency diminishes a capital defendant’s right to inform a jury of his parole ineligibility. There, South Carolina had argued that the defendant need not be allowed to present this information to the jury “because future exigencies,” including “commutation [and] clemency,” could one day “allow [him] to be released into society.” U.

The Court disagreed: “To the extent that the State opposes even a simple parole-ineligibility instruction because of hypothetical future developments, the argument has little force.”Ibid.;id.,at (opinion of O’Connor, J.) (explaining that the defendant had a right “to bring his parole ineligibility to the jury’s attention” and that the State could respond with “truthful information regarding the availability of commutation, pardon, and the like”).The State responds thatSimmons“ ‘applies only to instances where, as a legal matter, there isno possibilityof parole.’ ” Brief in Opposition (quotingRamdass, U. S., at (plurality opinion)). Notwithstanding the fact that Arizona law currently prevents all felons who committed their offenses after from obtaining parole, Ariz., at , P. 3d, at , Arizona reasons that “nothing prevents the legislature from creating a parole system in the future for which [Lynch] would have been eligible had the court sentenced him to life with the possibility of release after years.” Brief in Opposition .This Court’s precedents also foreclose that argument.Simmonssaid that the potential for future “legislative reform” could not justify refusing a parole-ineligibility instruction.

Accordingly, as this Court later explained, “the dispositive fact inSimmonswas that the defendant conclusively established his parole ineligibility under state law at the time of his trial.”Ramdass,supra, at (plurality opinion). In this case, the Arizona Supreme Court confirmed that parole was unavailable to Lynch under its law.Simmonsand its progeny establish Lynch’s right to inform his jury of that fact.The petition for writ of certiorari and the motion for leave to proceedin forma pauperisare granted.

The order alters practices concerning the entry of foreign nationals into the United States by, among other things, suspending entry of nationals from six designated countries for days. Respondents challenged the order in two separate lawsuits. They obtained preliminary injunctions barring enforcement of several of its provisions, including the -day suspension of entry. The injunctions were upheld in large measure by the Courts of Appeals.The Government filed separate petitions for certiorari, as well as applications to stay the preliminary injunctions entered by the lower courts. We grant the petitions for certiorari and grant the stay applications in part.IAOn January , , President Donald J. Trump signed Executive Order No. , Protecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States. Fed. Reg. (EO–1). EO–1 addressed policies and procedures relating to the entry of foreign nationals into this country. Among other directives, the order suspended entry of foreign nationals from seven countries identified as presenting heightened terrorism risks—Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen—for days. §3(c). Executive officials were instructed to review the adequacy of current practices relating to visa adjudications during this -day period. §3(a). EO–1 also modified refugee policy, suspending the United States Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) for days and reducing the number of refugees eligible to be admitted to the United States during fiscal year . §§5(a), (d).EO–1 was immediately challenged in court. Just a week after the order was issued, a Federal District Court entered a nationwide temporary restraining order enjoining enforcement of several of its key provisions.Washingtonv.Trump, WL (WD Wash., Feb. 3, ). Six days later, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit denied the Government’s emergency motion to stay the order pending appeal.Washingtonv.Trump, F. 3d (). Rather than continue to litigate EO–1, the Government announced that it would revoke the order and issue a new one.A second order followed on March 6, . See Protecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States, Exec. Order No. , Fed. Reg. (EO–2). EO–2 describes “conditions in six of the . . . countries” as to which EO–1 had suspended entry, stating that these conditions “demonstrate [that] nationals [of those countries] continue to present heightened risks to the security of the United States,” §1(e), and that “some of those who have entered the United States through our immigration system have proved to be threats to our national security,” §1(h).Having identified these concerns, EO–2 sets out a series of directives patterned on those found in EO–1. Several are relevant here. First, EO–2 directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to conduct a global review to determine whether foreign governments provide adequate information about nationals applying for United States visas. §2(a). EO–2 directs the Secretary to report his findings to the President within days of the order’s “effective date,” after which time those nations identified as deficient will be given days to alter their practices. §§2(b), (d)–(e).Second, EO–2 directs that entry of nationals from six of the seven countries designated in EO–1—Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen—be “suspended for days from the effective date” of the order. §2(c). EO–2 explains that this pause is necessary to ensure that dangerous individuals do not enter the United States while the Executive is working to establish “adequate standards . . . to prevent infiltration by foreign terrorists”; in addition, suspending entry will “temporarily reduce investigative burdens on agencies” during the Secretary’s -day review.Ibid.A separate section provides for case-by-case waivers of the entry bar. §3(c).Third, EO–2 suspends “decisions on applications for refugee status” and “travel of refugees into the United States under the USRAP” for days following its effective date. §6(a). During that period, the Secretary of State is instructed to review the adequacy of USRAP application and adjudication procedures and implement whatever additional procedures are necessary “to ensure that individuals seeking admission as refugees do not pose a threat” to national security.Ibid.Fourth, citing the President’s determination that “the entry of more than , refugees in fiscal year would be detrimental to the interests of the United States,” EO–2 “suspend[s] any entries in excess of that number” for this fiscal year. §6(b).Finally, § of EO–2 establishes the order’s effective date: March , .BRespondents in these cases filed separate lawsuits challenging EO–2. As relevant, they argued that the order violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment because it was motivated not by concerns pertaining to national security, but by animus toward Islam. They further argued that EO–2 does not comply with certain provisions in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 66Stat. , as amended.In No. –, a Federal District Court concluded that respondents were likely to succeed on their Establishment Clause claim with respect to §2(c) of EO–2—the provision temporarily suspending entry from six countries—and entered a nationwide preliminary injunction barring the Government from enforcing §2(c) against any foreign national seeking entry to the United States.International Refugee Assistance Projectv. Supp., Mar. , ) (IRAP). The District Court in No. –—likewise relying on the Establishment Clause—entered a broader preliminary injunction: The court enjoined nationwide enforcement of all of §§2 and 6.Hawaiiv. Supp., Mar. Supp., Mar. , ) (entering temporary restraining order). In addition to the §2(c) suspension of entry, this injunction covered the §6(a) suspension of refugee admissions, the §6(b) reduction in the refugee cap, and the provisions in §§2 and 6 pertaining only to internal executive review.These orders, entered before EO–2 went into effect, prevented the Government from initiating enforcement of the challenged provisions. The Government filed appeals in both cases.The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit ruled first. On May , over three dissenting votes, the en banc court issued a decision inIRAPthat largely upheld the order enjoining enforcement of §2(c). F. 3d . The major-ity determined that respondent John Doe #1, a lawful permanent resident whose Iranian wife is seeking entry to the United States, was likely to succeed on the merits of his Establishment Clause claim. The majority concluded that the primary purpose of §2(c) was religious, in violation of the First Amendment: A reasonable observer familiar with all the circumstances—including the predominantly Muslim character of the designated countries and statements made by President Trump during his Presidential campaign—would conclude that §2(c) was moti-vated principally by a desire to exclude Muslims from the United States, not by considerations relating to national security. Having reached this conclusion, the court upheld the preliminary injunction prohibiting enforcement of §2(c) against any foreign national seeking to enter this country.On June 1, the Government filed a petition for certiorari seeking review of the Fourth Circuit’s decision. It also filed applications seeking stays of both injunctions, including theHawaiiinjunction still pending before the Ninth Circuit. In addition, the Government requested that this Court expedite the certiorari stage briefing. We accordingly directed respondents to file responses to the stay appli-cations by June and respondents inIRAPto file a brief in opposition to the Government’s petition for certiorari by the same day.Respondents’ June filings injected a new issue into the cases. InIRAP, respondents argued that the suspension of entry in §2(c) would expire on June . Section 2(c), they reasoned, directs that entry “be suspended for days from the effective date of” EO–2. The “effective date” of EO–2 was March . §. Although courts had enjoined portions of EO–2, they had not altered its effective date, nor so much as mentioned §. Thus, even though it had never been enforced, the entry suspension would expire days from March : June . At that time, the dispute over §2(c) would become moot. Brief in Opposition –.On the same day respondents filed, the Ninth Circuit ruled inHawaii. A unanimous panel held in favor of respondents the State of Hawaii and Dr. Ismail Elshikh, an American citizen and imam whose Syrian mother-in-law is seeking entry to this country. Rather than rely on the constitutional grounds supporting the District Court’s decision, the court held that portions of EO–2 likely exceeded the President’s authority under the INA. On that basis it upheld the injunction as to the §2(c) entry suspension, the §6(a) suspension of refugee admissions, and the §6(b) refugee cap. The Ninth Circuit, like the Fourth Circuit, concluded that the injunction should bar enforcement of these provisions across the board, because they would violate the INA “in all applications.”Id., at *. The court did, however, narrow the injunction so that it would not bar the Government from undertaking the internal executive reviews directed by EO–2.We granted the parties’ requests for supplemental briefing addressed to the decision of the Ninth Circuit. Before those briefs were filed, however, the ground shifted again. On June , evidently in response to the argument that §2(c) was about to expire, President Trump issued a memorandum to Executive Branch officials. The memorandum declared the effective date of each enjoined provision of EO–2 to be the date on which the injunctions in these cases “are lifted or stayed with respect to that provision.” Presidential Memorandum for the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Director of National Intelligence (June , ). The memorandum further provided that, to the extent necessary, it “should be construed to amend the Executive Order.”Ibid.The Government takes the view that, if any mootness problem existed previously, the President’s memorandum has cured it.The parties have since completed briefing, with the Government requesting that we construe its supplemental brief inHawaiias a petition for certiorari. There is no objection from respondents, and we do so. Both petitions for certiorari and both stay applications are accordingly ripe for consideration.IIThe Government seeks review on several issues. InIRAP, the Government argues that respondent Doe lacks standing to challenge §2(c).[1]* The Government also contends that Doe’s Establishment Clause claim fails on the merits. In its view, the Fourth Circuit should not have asked whether §2(c) has a primarily religious purpose. The court instead should have upheld EO–2 because it rests on the “facially legitimate and bona fide” justification of protecting national security.Kleindienstv.Mandel, U. S. , (). In addition, the Fourth Circuit erred by focusing on the President’s campaign-trail comments to conclude that §2(c)—religiously neutral on its face—nonetheless has a principally religious purpose. At the very least, the Government argues, the injunction is too broad.InHawaii, the Government likewise argues that respondents Hawaii and Dr. Elshikh lack standing and that (at a minimum) the injunction should be narrowed. The Government’s principal merits contention pertains to a statutory provision authorizing the President to “suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens” to this country “[w]henever [he] finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens . . . would be detrimental to the interests of the United States.” 8 U. S. C. §(f). The Ninth Circuit held that “[t]here is no sufficient finding in [EO–2] that the entry of the excluded classes would be detrimental to the interests of the United States.”Hawaii, WL , at *. This, the Government argues, constitutes impermissible judicial second-guessing of the President’s judgment on a matter of national security.In addition to seeking certiorari, the Government asks the Court to stay the injunctions entered below, thereby permitting the enjoined provisions to take effect. According to the Government, it is likely to suffer irreparable harm unless a stay issues. Focusing mostly on §2(c), and pointing to the descriptions of conditions in the six designated nations, the Government argues that a -day pause on entry is necessary to prevent potentially dangerous individuals from entering the United States while the Executive reviews the adequacy of information provided by foreign governments in connection with visa adjudications. Additionally, the Government asserts, the temporary bar is needed to reduce the Executive’s investigative burdens while this review proceeds.ATo begin, we grant both of the Government’s petitions for certiorari and consolidate the cases for argument. The Clerk is directed to set a briefing schedule that will permit the cases to be heard during the first session of October Term . (The Government has not requested that we expedite consideration of the merits to a greater extent.) In addition to the issues identified in the petitions, the parties are directed to address the following question: “Whether the challenges to §2(c) became moot on June , .”BWe now turn to the preliminary injunctions barring enforcement of the §2(c) entry suspension. We grant the Government’s applications to stay the injunctions, to the extent the injunctions prevent enforcement of §2(c) with respect to foreign nationals who lack any bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States. We leave the injunctions entered by the lower courts in place with respect to respondents and those similarly situated, as specified in this opinion. Seeinfra,at –.Crafting a preliminary injunction is an exercise of discretion and judgment, often dependent as much on the equities of a given case as the substance of the legal issues it presents. SeeWinterv.Natural Resources Defense Council,Inc., U. S. 7, , () ; 11A C. Wright, A. Miller, & M. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure § (3d ed. ). The purpose of such interim equitable relief is not to conclusively determine the rights of the parties,University of Tex.v.Camenisch, U. S. , () , but to balance the equities as the litigation moves forward. In awarding a preliminary injunction a court must also “conside[r] . . . the overall public interest.”Winter,supra, at . In the course of doing so, a court “need not grant the total relief sought by the applicant but may mold its decree to meet the exigencies of the particular case.” Wright,supra, §, at .Here, of course, we are not asked to grant a preliminary injunction, but to stay one. In assessing the lower courts’ exercise of equitable discretion, we bring to bear an equitable judgment of our own.Nkenv.Holder, U. S. , () . Before issuing a stay, “[i]t is ultimately necessary . . . to balance the equities—to explore the relative harms to applicant and respondent, as well as the interests of the public at large.”Barnesv.E-Systems, Inc. Group Hospital Medical & Surgical Ins. Plan, U. S. , () ([REDACTED], J., in chambers) (internal quotation marks omitted). This Court may, in its discretion, tailor a stay so that it operates with respect to only “some portion of the proceeding.”Nken,supra, at .The courts below took account of the equities in fashioning interim relief, focusing specifically on the concrete burdens that would fall on Doe, Dr. Elshikh, and Hawaii if §2(c) were enforced. They reasoned that §2(c) would “directly affec[t]” Doe and Dr. Elshikh by delaying entry of their family members to the United States.IRAP, F. 3d, at , n. ; seeHawaii, WL , at *7–*8, *. The Ninth Circuit concluded that §2(c) would harm the State by preventing students from the desig-nated nations who had been admitted to the University of Hawaii from entering this country. These hardships, the courts reasoned, were sufficiently weighty and immediate to outweigh the Government’s interest in enforcing §2(c). Having adopted this view of the equities, the courts approved injunctions that covered not just respondents, but parties similarly situated to them—that is, people or entities in the United States who have relationships with foreign nationals abroad, and whose rights might be affected if those foreign nationals were excluded. SeeMandel, U. S., at – (permitting American plaintiffs to challenge the exclusion of a foreign national on the ground that the exclusion violated their own First Amendment rights).But the injunctions reach much further than that: They also bar enforcement of §2(c) against foreign nationals abroad who have no connection to the United States at all. The equities relied on by the lower courts do not balance the same way in that context. Denying entry to such a foreign national does not burden any American party by reason of that party’s relationship with the foreign national. And the courts below did not conclude that exclusion in such circumstances would impose any legally relevant hardship on the foreign national himself. Seeid., at (“[A]n unadmitted and nonresident alien . . . ha[s] no constitutional right of entry to this country”). So whatever burdens may result from enforcement of §2(c) against a foreign national who lacks any connection to this country, they are, at a minimum, a good deal less concrete than the hardships identified by the courts below.At the same time, the Government’s interest in enforcing §2(c), and the Executive’s authority to do so, are undoubtedly at their peak when there is no tie between the foreign national and the United States. Indeed, EO–2 itself distinguishes between foreign nationals who have some connection to this country, and foreign nationals who do not, by establishing a case-by-case waiver system primarily for the benefit of individuals in the former cate-gory. See,e.g., §§3(c)(i)–(vi). The interest in preserving national security is “an urgent objective of the highest order.”Holderv.Humanitarian Law Project, U. S. 1, () . To prevent the Government from pursuing that objective by enforcing §2(c) against foreign nationals unconnected to the United States would appreciably injure its interests, without alleviating obvious hardship to anyone else.We accordingly grant the Government’s stay applications in part and narrow the scope of the injunctions as to §2(c). The injunctions remain in place only with respect to parties similarly situated to Doe, Dr. Elshikh, and Hawaii. In practical terms, this means that §2(c) may not be enforced against foreign nationals who have a credible claim of a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States. All other foreign nationals are subject to the provisions of EO–2.The facts of these cases illustrate the sort of relationship that qualifies. For individuals, a close familial relationship is required. A foreign national who wishes to enter the United States to live with or visit a family member, like Doe’s wife or Dr. Elshikh’s mother-in-law, clearly has such a relationship. As for entities, the relationship must be formal, documented, and formed in the ordinary course, rather than for the purpose of evading EO–2. The students from the designated countries who have been admitted to the University of Hawaii have such a relationship with an American entity. So too would a worker who accepted an offer of employment from an American company or a lecturer invited to address an American audience. Not so someone who enters into a relationship sim-ply to avoid §2(c): For example, a nonprofit group devoted to immigration issues may not contact foreign nationals from the designated countries, add them to client lists, and then secure their entry by claiming injury from their exclusion.In light of the June decision of the Ninth Circuit vacating the injunction as to §2(a), the executive review directed by that subsection may proceed promptly, if it is not already underway. EO–2 instructs the Secretary of Homeland Security to complete this review within days, after which time foreign governments will be given days further to bring their practices into line with the Secretary’s directives. §§2(a)–(b), (d). Given the Government’s representations in this litigation concerning the resources required to complete the -day review, we fully expect that the relief we grant today will permit the Executive to conclude its internal work and provide adequate notice to foreign governments within the -day life of §2(c).CTheHawaiiinjunction extends beyond §2(c) to bar enforcement of the §6(a) suspension of refugee admissions and the §6(b) refugee cap. In our view, the equitable balance struck above applies in this context as well. An American individual or entity that has a bona fide relationship with a particular person seeking to enter the country as a refugee can legitimately claim concrete hardship if that person is excluded. As to these individuals and entities, we do not disturb the injunction. But when it comes to refugees who lack any such connection to the United States, for the reasons we have set out, the balance tips in favor of the Government’s compelling need to provide for the Nation’s security. Seesupra,at 9–;Haigv.Agee, U. S. , () .The Government’s application to stay the injunction with respect to §§6(a) and (b) is accordingly granted in part. Section 6(a) may not be enforced against an individual seeking admission as a refugee who can credibly claim a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States. Nor may §6(b); that is, such a person may not be excluded pursuant to §6(b), even if the ,-person cap has been reached or exceeded. As applied to all other individuals, the provisions may take effect.* * *Accordingly, the petitions for certiorari are granted, and the stay applications are granted in part.It is so ordered.* On June , , this Court received a letter from counsel for Doe advising that Doe’s wife received an immigrant visa on or about June , . The parties may address the significance of that development at the merits stage. It does not affect our analysis of the stay issues in these cases."}

Decided November 6, 2017Per Curiam.More than years ago, Vernon Madison crept up behind police officer Julius Schulte and shot him twice in the head at close range. An Alabama jury found Madison guilty of capital murder. The trial court sentenced him to death. SeeEx parte Madison, So. 2d , – ().In , as Madison’s execution neared, he petitioned the trial court for a suspension of his death sentence. He argued that, due to several recent strokes, he has become incompetent to be executed. The court held a hearing to receive testimony from two psychologists who had examined Madison and prepared reports concerning his competence. The court’s appointed psychologist, Dr. Karl Kirkland, reported that, although Madison may have “suffered a significant decline post-stroke, . . . [he] understands the exact posture of his case at this point,” and appears to have a “rational understanding of . . . the results or effects” of his death sentence. App. to Pet. for Cert. 75a (internal quotation marks omitted);Madisonv.Commissioner, Ala. Dept. of Corrections, F. 3d , ( ) (internal quotation marks omitted). Asked at the hearing whether Madison understands that Alabama is seeking retribution against him for his criminal act, Dr. Kirkland answered, “Certainly.”Id., at (internal quotation marks omitted).Dr. John Goff, a psychologist hired by Madison’s counsel, reported that Madison’s strokes have rendered him unable to remember “numerous events that have occurred over the past thirty years or more.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 77a. Nevertheless, Dr. Goff found that Madison “is able to understand the nature of the pending proceeding and he has an understanding of what he was tried for”; that he knows he is “in prison . . . because of ‘murder’ ”; that he “understands that . . . [Alabama is] seeking retribution” for that crime; and that he “understands the sentence, specifically the meaning of a death sentence.”Id.,at 76a–78a (some internal quotation marks omitted). In Dr. Goff’s opinion, however, Madison does not “understan[d] the act that . . . he is being punished for” because he cannot recall “the sequence of events from the offense to his arrest to the trial or any of those details” and believes that he “never went around killing folks.”Ibid.(internal quotation marks omitted).The trial court denied Madison’s petition. It held that, under this Court’s decisions inFordv.Wainwright, U. S. () , andPanettiv.Quarterman, U. S. () , Madison was entitled to relief if he could show that he “suffers from a mental illness which deprives [him] of the mental capacity to rationally understand that he is being executed as a punishment for a crime.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 74a. The court concluded that Madison had failed to make that showing. Specifically, it found that Madison understands “that he is going to be executed because of the murder he committed[,] . . . that the State is seeking retribution[,] and that he will die when he is executed.”Id.,at 82a.Madison then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in Federal District Court. As a state prisoner, Madison is entitled to federal habeas relief under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of (AEDPA) only if the state trial court’s adjudication of his incompetence claim “was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by” this Court, or else was “based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented” in state court. U. S. C. § (d). A habeas petitioner meets this demanding standard only when he shows that the state court’s decision was “so lacking in justification that there was an error well understood and comprehended in existing law beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.”Harringtonv.Richter, U. S. , () . The District Court denied Madison’s petition after concluding that the state court “correctly appliedFordandPanetti” and did not make an “unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 67a.The Eleventh Circuit granted a certificate of appealability and, on appeal, reversed over Judge Jordan’s dissent. In the majority’s view, given the undisputed fact that Madison “has no memory of his capital offense,” it inescapably follows that he “does not rationally understand the connection between his crime and his execution.” F. 3d, at –. On that basis, the Eleventh Circuit held that the trial court’s conclusion that Madison is competent to be executed was “plainly unreasonable” and “cannot be reconciled with any reasonable application ofPanetti.”Id.,at – (internal quotation marks omitted).We disagree. InPanetti, this Court addressed the question whether the Eighth Amendment forbids the execution of a prisoner who lacks “the mental capacity to understand that [he] is being executed as a punishment for a crime.” U. S., at (internal quotation marks omitted). We noted that the retributive purpose of capital punishment is not well served where “the prisoner’s mental state is so distorted by a mental illness that his awareness of the crime and punishment has little or no relation to the understanding of those concepts shared by the community as a whole.”Id.,at –. Similarly, inFord, we questioned the “retributive value of executing a person who has no comprehension of why he has been singled out.” U. S., at . NeitherPanettinorFord“clearly established” that a prisoner is incompetent to be executed because of a failure to remember his commission of the crime, as distinct from a failure to rationally comprehend the concepts of crime and punishment as applied in his case. The state court did not unreasonably applyPanettiandFordwhen it determined that Madison is competent to be executed because—notwithstanding his memory loss—he recognizes that he will be put to death as punishment for the murder he was found to have committed.Nor was the state court’s decision founded on an unreasonable assessment of the evidence before it. Testimony from each of the psychologists who examined Madison supported the court’s finding that Madison understands both that he was tried and imprisoned for murder and that Alabama will put him to death as punishment for that crime.In short, the state court’s determinations of law and fact were not “so lacking in justification” as to give rise to error “beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.”Richter,supra, at . Under that deferential standard, Madison’s claim to federal habeas relief must fail. We express no view on the merits of the underlying question outside of the AEDPA context.The petition for a writ of certiorari and respondent’s motion to proceedin forma pauperisare granted, and the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.It is so ordered."}

Decided October , 2021Per Curiam.Petitioner Daniel Rivas-Villegas, a police officer in Union City, California, responded to a call reporting that a woman and her two children were barricaded in a room for fear that respondent Ramon Cortesluna, the woman’s boyfriend, was going to hurt them. After confirming that the family had no way of escaping the house, Rivas-Villegas and the other officers present commanded Cortesluna outside and onto the ground. Officers saw a knife in Cortesluna’s left pocket. While Rivas-Villegas and another officer were in the process of removing the knife and handcuffing Cortesluna, Rivas-Villegas briefly placed his knee on the left side of Cortesluna’s back. Cortesluna later sued under Rev. Stat. §, U. S. C. §, alleging, as relevant, that Rivas-Villegas used excessive force. At issue here is whether Rivas-Villegas is entitled to qualified immunity because he did not violate clearly established law.The undisputed facts are as follows. A operator received a call from a crying -year-old girl reporting that she, her mother, and her -year-old sister had shut themselves into a room at their home because her mother’s boyfriend, Cortesluna, was trying to hurt them and had a chainsaw. The girl told the operator that Cortesluna was “ ‘always drinking,’ ” had “ ‘anger issues,’ ” was “ ‘really mad,’ ” and was using the chainsaw to “ ‘break something in the house.’ ”Corteslunav.Leon, F.3d , ( ). A police dispatcher relayed this information along with a description of Cortesluna in a request for officers to respond.Rivas-Villegas heard the broadcast and responded to the scene along with four other officers. The officers spent several minutes observing the home and reported seeing through a window a man matching Cortesluna’s description. One officer asked whether the girl and her family could exit the house. Dispatch responded that they “ ‘were unable to get out’ ” and confirmed that the operator had “ ‘hear[d] sawing in the background’ ” and thought that Cortesluna might be trying to saw down the door.Corteslunav.Leon, WL , *2 (ND Cal., Dec. , ).After receiving this information, Rivas-Villegas knocked on the door and stated loudly, “ ‘police department, come to the front door, Union City police, come to the front door.’ ”Ibid.Another officer yelled, “ ‘he’s coming and has a weapon.’ ”Ibid.A different officer then stated, “ ‘use less-lethal,’ ” referring to a beanbag shotgun.Ibid.When Rivas-Villegas ordered Cortesluna to “ ‘drop it,’ ” Cortesluna dropped the “weapon,” later identified as a metal tool.Ibid.Rivas-Villegas then commanded, “ ‘come out, put your hands up, walk out towards me.’ ” F. 3d, at . Cortesluna put his hands up and Rivas-Villegas told him to “ ‘keep coming.’ ”Ibid.As Cortesluna walked out of the house and toward the officers, Rivas-Villegas said, “ ‘Stop. Get on your knees.’ ”Ibid.Plaintiff stopped to feet from the officers. Another officer then saw a knife sticking out from the front left pocket of Cortesluna’s pants and shouted, “ ‘he has a knife in his left pocket, knife in his pocket,’ ” and directed Cortesluna, “ ‘don’t put your hands down,’ ” “ ‘hands up.’ ” WL , *2. Cortesluna turned his head toward the instructing officer but then lowered his head and his hands in contravention of the officer’s orders. Another officer twice shot Cortesluna with a beanbag round from his shotgun, once in the lower stomach and once in the left hip.After the second shot, Cortesluna raised his hands over his head. The officers shouted for him to “ ‘get down,’ ” which he did. Another officer stated, “ ‘left pocket, he’s got a knife.’ ”Ibid.Rivas-Villegas then straddled Cortesluna. He placed his right foot on the ground next to Cortesluna’s right side with his right leg bent at the knee. He placed his left knee on the left side of Cortesluna’s back, near where Cortesluna had a knife in his pocket. He raised both of Cortesluna’s arms up behind his back. Rivas-Villegas was in this position for no more than eight seconds before standing up while continuing to hold Cortesluna’s arms. At that point, another officer, who had just removed the knife from Cortesluna’s pocket and tossed it away, came and handcuffed Cortesluna’s hands behind his back. Rivas-Villegas lifted Cortesluna up and moved him away from the door.Cortesluna brought suit under U. S. C. §, claiming, as relevant here, that Rivas-Villegas used excessive force in violation of the Fourth Amendment. The District Court granted summary judgment to Rivas-Villegas, but the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed. F. 3d, at .The Court of Appeals held that “Rivas-Villegas is not entitled to qualified immunity because existing precedent put him on notice that his conduct constituted excessive force.”Id.,at . In reaching this conclusion, the Court of Appeals relied solely onLaLondev.County of Riverside, F.3d ( ). The court acknowledged that “the officers here responded to a more volatile situation than did the officers inLaLonde.” F. 3d, at . Nevertheless, it reasoned: “BothLaLondeand this case involve suspects who were lying face-down on the ground and were not resisting either physically or verbally, on whose back the defendant officer leaned with a knee, causing allegedly significant injury.”Ibid.Judge Collins dissented. As relevant, he argued that “the facts ofLaLondeare materially distinguishable from this case and are therefore insufficient to have made clear to every reasonable officer that the force Rivas-Villegas used here was excessive.”Id.,at (internal quotation marks omitted).We agree and therefore reverse. Even assuming that controlling Circuit precedent clearly establishes law for purposes of §,LaLondedid not give fair notice to Rivas-Villegas. He is thus entitled to qualified immunity.“Qualified immunity attaches when an official’s conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.”Whitev.Pauly, U. S., at 6) (internal quotation marks omitted). A right is clearly established when it is “sufficiently clear that every reasonable official would have understood that what he is doing violates that right.”Mullenixv.Luna, U.S. 7, () (per curiam) (internal quotation marks omitted). Although “this Court’s case law does not require a case directly on point for a right to be clearly established, existing precedent must have placed the statutory or constitutional question beyond debate.”White, U. S., at 6) (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted). This inquiry “must be undertaken in light of the specific context of the case, not as a broad general proposition.”Brosseauv.Haugen, U.S. , () (per curiam) (internal quotation marks omitted).“[S]pecificity is especially important in the Fourth Amendment context, where . . . it is sometimes difficult for an officer to determine how the relevant legal doctrine, here excessive force, will apply to the factual situation the officer confronts.”Mullenix, U. S., at (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted). Whether an officer has used excessive force depends on “the facts and circumstances of each particular case, including the severity of the crime at issue, whether the suspect poses an immediate threat to the safety of the officers or others, and whether he is actively resisting arrest or attempting to evade arrest by flight.”Grahamv.Connor, U.S. , (); see alsoTennesseev.Garner, U.S. 1, () (“Where the officer has probable cause to believe that the suspect poses a threat of serious physical harm, either to the officer or to others, it is not constitutionally unreasonable to prevent escape by using deadly force”). However,Graham’s andGarner’s standards are cast “at a high level of generality.”Brosseau, U. S., at . “[I]n an obvious case, these standards can ‘clearly establish’ the answer, even without a body of relevant case law.”Ibid.But this is not an obvious case. Thus, to show a violation of clearly established law, Cortesluna must identify a case that put Rivas-Villegas on notice that his specific conduct was unlawful.Cortesluna has not done so. Neither Cortesluna nor the Court of Appeals identified any Supreme Court case that addresses facts like the ones at issue here. Instead, the Court of Appeals relied solely on its precedent inLaLonde. Even assuming that Circuit precedent can clearly establish law for purposes of §,LaLondeis materially distinguishable and thus does not govern the facts of this case.InLaLonde, officers were responding to a neighbor’s complaint that LaLonde had been making too much noise in his apartment. F. 3d, at –. When they knocked on LaLonde’s door, he “appeared in his underwear and a T-shirt, holding a sandwich in his hand.”Id.,at . LaLonde testified that, after he refused to let the officers enter his home, they did so anyway and informed him he would be arrested for obstruction of justice.Ibid.One officer then knocked the sandwich from LaLonde’s hand and “grabbed LaLonde by his ponytail and knocked him backwards to the ground.”Id.,at . After a short scuffle, the officer sprayed LaLonde in the face with pepper spray. At that point, LaLonde ceased resisting and another officer, while handcuffing LaLonde, “deliberately dug his knee into LaLonde’s back with a force that caused him long-term if not permanent back injury.”Id.,at , , n. .The situation inLaLondeand the situation at issue here diverge in several respects. InLaLonde, officers were responding to a mere noise complaint, whereas here they were responding to a serious alleged incident of domestic violence possibly involving a chainsaw. In addition, LaLonde was unarmed. Cortesluna, in contrast, had a knife protruding from his left pocket for which he had just previously appeared to reach. Further, in this case, video evidence shows, and Cortesluna does not dispute, that Rivas-Villegas placed his knee on Cortesluna for no more than eight seconds and only on the side of his back near the knife that officers were in the process of retrieving. LaLonde, in contrast, testified that the officer deliberately dug his knee into his back when he had no weapon and had made no threat when approached by police. These facts, considered together in the context of this particular arrest, materially distinguish this case fromLaLonde.“Precedent involving similar facts can help move a case beyond the otherwise hazy borders between excessive and acceptable force and thereby provide an officer notice that a specific use of force is unlawful.”Kiselav.Hughes, U. S., at 5) (internal quotation marks omitted). On the facts of this case, neitherLaLondenor any decision of this Court is sufficiently similar. For that reason, we grant Rivas-Villegas’ petition for certiorari and reverse the Ninth Circuit’s determination that Rivas-Villegas is not entitled to qualified immunity.It is so ordered."}
{"file_name": "per curiam_2006_867_547.json", "author": "per curiam", "year": 2006, "text": "–. Decided June , 2006Per Curiam.In April , the State of West Virginia indicted petitioner Denver A. Youngblood, Jr., on charges including abduction of three young women, Katara, Kimberly, and Wendy, and two instances of sexual assault upon Katara. The cases went to trial in in the Circuit Court of Morgan County, where a jury convicted Youngblood of two counts of sexual assault, two counts of brandishing a firearm, and one count of indecent exposure. The conviction rested principally on the testimony of the three women that they were held captive by Youngblood and a friend of his, statements by Katara that she was forced at gunpoint to perform oral sex on Youngblood, and evidence consistent with a claim by Katara about disposal of certain physical evidence of their sexual encounter. Youngblood was sentenced to a combined term of to years’ imprisonment, with to of those years directly attributable to the sexual-assault convictions.Several months after being sentenced, Youngblood moved to set aside the verdict. He claimed that an investigator working on his case had uncovered new and exculpatory evidence, in the form of a graphically explicit note that both squarely contradicted the State’s account of the incidents and directly supported Youngblood’s consensual-sex defense. The note, apparently written by Kimberly and Wendy, taunted Youngblood and his friend for having been “played” for fools, warned them that the girls had vandalized the house where Youngblood brought them, and mockingly thanked Youngblood for performing oral sex on Katara. The note was said to have been shown to a state trooper investigating the sexual-assault allegations against Youngblood; the trooper allegedly read the note but declined to take possession of it, and told the person who produced it to destroy it. Youngblood argued that the suppression of this evidence violated the State’s federal constitutional obligation to disclose evidence favorable to the defense, and in support of his argument he referred to cases citing and applyingBradyv.Maryland, U. S. ().The trial court denied Youngblood a new trial, saying that the note provided only impeachment, but not exculpatory, evidence. The trial court did not discussBradyor its scope, but expressed the view that the investigating trooper had attached no importance to the note, and because he had failed to give it to the prosecutor the State could not now be faulted for failing to share it with Youngblood’s counsel. See App. C to Pet. for Cert. (Tr. – (Sept. , )).A bare majority of the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia affirmed, finding no abuse of discretion on the part of the trial court, but without examining the specific constitutional claims associated with the alleged suppression of favorable evidence. W. Va. , , S. E. 2d , ()(per curiam). [REDACTED], dissenting in an opinion that [REDACTED] joined, unambiguously characterized the trooper’s instruction to discard the new evidence as aBradyviolation.Id.,at –, S. E. 2d, at –. The dissenters concluded that the note indicating that Youngblood engaged in consensual sex with Katara had been suppressed and was material,id.,at , n. 6, S. E. 2d, at , n. 6 (citingKylesv.Whitley, U. S. , , – ()), both because it was at odds with the testimony provided by the State’s three chief witnesses (Katara, Kimberly, and Wendy) and also because it was entirely consistent with Youngblood’s defense at trial that his sexual encounters with Katara were consensual, W. Va., at –, S. E. 2d, at –. Youngblood then filed this petition for a writ of certiorari.ABradyviolation occurs when the government fails to disclose evidence materially favorable to the accused. See U. S., at . This Court has held that theBradyduty extends to impeachment evidence as well as exculpatory evidence,United Statesv.Bagley, U. S. , (), andBradysuppression occurs when the government fails to turn over even evidence that is “known only to police investigators and not to the prosecutor,”Kyles, U. S., at . Seeid.,at (“[T]he individual prosecutor has a duty to learn of any favorable evidence known to the others acting on the government’s behalf in the case, including the police”). “Such evidence is material ‘if there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different,’ ”Stricklerv.Greene, U. S. , () (quotingBagley,supra, at (opinion of Blackmun, J.)), although a “showing of materiality does not require demonstration by a preponderance that disclosure of the suppressed evidence would have resulted ultimately in the defendant’s acquittal,”Kyles, U. S., at . The reversal of a conviction is required upon a “showing that the favorable evidence could reasonably be taken to put the whole case in such a different light as to undermine confidence in the verdict.”Id.,at .Youngblood clearly presented a federal constitutionalBradyclaim to the State Supreme Court, see Brief for Appellant in No. (Sup. Ct. App. W. Va.), pp. –, as he had to the trial court, see App. C to Pet. for Cert. (Tr. 6, –, , (Sept. , ));id., at , (Sept. , ). And, as noted, the dissenting justices discerned the significance of the issue raised. If this Court is to reach the merits of this case, it would be better to have the benefit of the views of the full Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia on theBradyissue. We, therefore, grant the petition for certiorari, vacate the judgment of the State Supreme Court, and remand the case for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.It is so ordered."}
{"file_name": "per curiam_2007_609_550.json", "author": "per curiam", "year": 2007, "text": "–. Decided May , 2007Per Curiam.Deputies of the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department obtained a valid warrant to search a house, but they were unaware that the suspects being sought had moved out three months earlier. When the deputies searched the house, they found in a bedroom two residents who were of a different race than the suspects. The deputies ordered these innocent residents, who had been sleeping unclothed, out of bed. The deputies required them to stand for a few minutes before allowing them to dress.The residents brought suit under Rev. Stat. §, U. S. C. §, naming the deputies and other parties and accusing them of violating the Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. The District Court granted summary judgment to all named defendants. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed, concluding both that the deputies violated the Fourth Amendment and that they were not entitled to qualified immunity because a reasonable deputy would have stopped the search upon discovering that respondents were of a different race than the suspects and because a reasonable deputy would not have ordered respondents from their bed. We grant the petition for certiorari and reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals by this summary disposition.IFrom September to December , Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department Deputy Dennis Watters investigated a fraud and identity-theft crime ring. There were four suspects of the investigation. One had registered a 9-millimeter Glock handgun. The four suspects were known to be African-Americans.On December , Watters obtained a search warrant for two houses in Lancaster, California, where he believed he could find the suspects. The warrant authorized him to search the homes and three of the suspects for documents and computer files. In support of the search warrant an affidavit cited various sources showing the suspects resided at respondents’ home. The sources included Department of Motor Vehicles reports, mailing address listings, an outstanding warrant, and an Internet telephone directory. In this Court respondents do not dispute the validity of the warrant or the means by which it was obtained.What Watters did not know was that one of the houses (the first to be searched) had been sold in September to a Max Rettele. He had purchased the home and moved into it three months earlier with his girlfriend Judy Sadler and Sadler’s -year-old son Chase Hall. All three, respondents here, are Caucasians.On the morning of December , Watters briefed six other deputies in preparation for the search of the houses. Watters informed them they would be searching for three African-American suspects, one of whom owned a registered handgun. The possibility a suspect would be armed caused the deputies concern for their own safety. Watters had not obtained special permission for a night search, so he could not execute the warrant until 7 a.m. See Cal. Penal Code Ann. § (West ). Around 7: Watters and six other deputies knocked on the door and announced their presence. Chase Hall answered. The deputies entered the house after ordering Hall to lie face down on the ground.The deputies’ announcement awoke Rettele and Sadler. The deputies entered their bedroom with guns drawn and ordered them to get out of their bed and to show their hands. They protested that they were not wearing clothes. Rettele stood up and attempted to put on a pair of sweatpants, but deputies told him not to move. Sadler also stood up and attempted, without success, to cover herself with a sheet. Rettele and Sadler were held at gunpoint for one to two minutes before Rettele was allowed to retrieve a robe for Sadler. He was then permitted to dress. Rettele and Sadler left the bedroom within three to four minutes to sit on the couch in the living room.By that time the deputies realized they had made a mistake. They apologized to Rettele and Sadler, thanked them for not becoming upset, and left within five minutes. They proceeded to the other house the warrant authorized them to search, where they found three suspects. Those suspects were arrested and convicted.Rettele and Sadler, individually and as guardians ad litem for Hall, filed this § suit against Los Angeles County, the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department, Deputy Watters, and other members of the sheriff’s department. Respondents alleged petitioners violated their Fourth Amendment rights by obtaining a warrant in reckless fashion and conducting an unreasonable search and detention. The District Court held that the warrant was obtained by proper procedures and the search was reasonable. It concluded in the alternative that any Fourth Amendment rights the deputies violated were not clearly established and that, as a result, the deputies were entitled to qualified immunity.On appeal respondents did not challenge the validity of the warrant; they did argue that the deputies had conducted the search in an unreasonable manner. A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed in an unpublished opinion. Fed. Appx. (). The majority held that“because (1) no African-Americans lived in [respondents’] home; (2) [respondents], a Caucasian couple, purchased the residence several months before the search and the deputies did not conduct an ownership inquiry; (3) the African-American suspects were not accused of a crime that required an emergency search; and (4) [respondents] were ordered out of bed naked and held at gunpoint while the deputies searched their bedroom for the suspects and a gun, we find that a reasonable jury could conclude that the search and detention were ‘unnecessarily painful, degrading, or prolonged,’ and involved ‘an undue invasion of privacy,’Franklinv.Foxworth, F. 3d , (9th Cir. ).”Id.,at .Turning to whether respondents’ Fourth Amendment rights were clearly established, the majority held that a reasonable deputy should have known the search and detention were unlawful.Judge Cowen dissented. In his view the deputies had authority to detain respondents for the duration of the search and were justified in ordering respondents from their bed because weapons could have been concealed under the bedcovers. He also concluded that, assuming a constitutional violation, the law was not clearly established.The Court of Appeals denied rehearing and rehearing en banc.IIBecause respondents were of a different race than the suspects the deputies were seeking, the Court of Appeals held that “[a]fter taking one look at [respondents], the deputies should have realized that [respondents] were not the subjects of the search warrant and did not pose a threat to the deputies’ safety.”Ibid.We need not pause long in rejecting this unsound proposition. When the deputies ordered respondents from their bed, they had no way of knowing whether the African-American suspects were elsewhere in the house. The presence of some Caucasians in the residence did not eliminate the possibility that the suspects lived there as well. As the deputies stated in their affidavits, it is not uncommon in our society for people of different races to live together. Just as people of different races live and work together, so too might they engage in joint criminal activity. The deputies, who were searching a house where they believed a suspect might be armed, possessed authority to secure the premises before deciding whether to continue with the search.InMichiganv.Summers, U. S. (), this Court held that officers executing a search warrant for contraband may “detain the occupants of the premises while a proper search is conducted.”Id.,at . In weighing whether the search inSummerswas reasonable the Court first found that “detention represents only an incremental intrusion on personal liberty when the search of a home has been authorized by a valid warrant.”Id., at . Against that interest, it balanced “preventing flight in the event that incriminating evidence is found”; “minimizing the risk of harm to the officers”; and facilitating “the orderly completion of the search.”Id.,at –; seeMuehlerv.Mena, U. S. ().In executing a search warrant officers may take reasonable action to secure the premises and to ensure their own safety and the efficacy of the search.Id.,at –; see alsoid.,at ([REDACTED], J., concurring);Summers,supra, at –. The test of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment is an objective one.Grahamv.Connor, U. S. , () (addressing the reasonableness of a seizure of the person). Unreasonable actions include the use of excessive force or restraints that cause unnecessary pain or are imposed for a prolonged and unnecessary period of time.Mena,supra, at ;Graham,supra, at –.The orders by the police to the occupants, in the context of this lawful search, were permissible, and perhaps necessary, to protect the safety of the deputies. Blankets and bedding can conceal a weapon, and one of the suspects was known to own a firearm, factors which underscore this point. The Constitution does not require an officer to ignore the possibility that an armed suspect may sleep with a weapon within reach. The reports are replete with accounts of suspects sleeping close to weapons. SeeUnited Statesv.Enslin, F. 3d , ( ) (“When [the suspect] put his hands in the air and began to sit up, his movement shifted the covers and the marshals could see a gun in the bed next to him”); see alsoUnited Statesv.Jones, F. 3d , ( ) (suspect kept a 9-millimeter Luger under his pillow while he slept);United Statesv.Hightower, F. 3d ( ) (suspect kept a loaded five-shot handgun under his pillow);Statev.Willis, ,–KA, p. 3 (La.

App. , P. 3d () (suspect kept a handgun in the bed).The deputies needed a moment to secure the room and ensure that other persons were not close by or did not present a danger. Deputies were not required to turn their backs to allow Rettele and Sadler to retrieve clothing or to cover themselves with the sheets. Rather, “[t]he risk of harm to both the police and the occupants is minimized if the officers routinely exercise unquestioned command of the situation.”Summers, U. S., at –.This is not to say, of course, that the deputies were free to force Rettele and Sadler to remain motionless and standing for any longer than necessary. We have recognized that “special circumstances, or possibly a prolonged detention” might render a search unreasonable. Seeid.,at , n. . There is no accusation that the detention here was prolonged. The deputies left the home less than minutes after arriving. The detention was shorter and less restrictive than the 2- to 3-hour handcuff detention upheld inMena. See U. S., at . And there is no allegation that the deputies prevented Sadler and Rettele from dressing longer than necessary to protect their safety. Sadler was unclothed for no more than two minutes, and Rettele for only slightly more time than that. Sadler testified that once the police were satisfied that no immediate threat was presented, “they wanted us to get dressed and they were pressing us really fast to hurry up and get some clothes on.” Deposition of Judy Lorraine Sadler in No. CV––RSWL (RNBX) (CD Cal., June , ), Doc. , Exh. 4, p. .The Fourth Amendment allows warrants to issue on probable cause, a standard well short of absolute certainty. Valid warrants will issue to search the innocent, and people like Rettele and Sadler unfortunately bear the cost. Officers executing search warrants on occasion enter a house when residents are engaged in private activity; and the resulting frustration, embarrassment, and humiliation may be real, as was true here. When officers execute a valid warrant and act in a reasonable manner to protect themselves from harm, however, the Fourth Amendment is not violated.As respondents’ constitutional rights were not violated, “there is no necessity for further inquiries concerning qualified immunity.”Saucierv.Katz, U.

{"file_name": "per curiam_2024_23-719_601.json", "author": "per curiam", "year": 2024, "text": "A group of Colorado voters contends that Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution prohibits former President Donald J. Trump, who seeks the Presidential nomination of the Republican Party in this year’s election, from becoming President again. The Colorado Supreme Court agreed with that contention. It ordered the Colorado secretary of state to exclude the former President from the Republican primary ballot in the State and to disregard any write-in votes that Colorado voters might cast for him.Former President Trump challenges that decision on several grounds. Because the Constitution makes Congress, rather than the States, responsible for enforcing Section 3 against federal officeholders and candidates, we reverse.ILast September, about six months before the March 5, , Colorado primary election, four Republican and two unaffiliated Colorado voters filed a petition against former President Trump and Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold in Colorado state court. These voters—whom we refer to as the respondents—contend that after former President Trump’s defeat in the Presidential election, he disrupted the peaceful transfer of power by intentionally organizing and inciting the crowd that breached the Capitol as Congress met to certify the election results on January 6, . One consequence of those actions, the respondents maintain, is that former President Trump is constitutionally ineligible to serve as President again.Their theory turns on Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment. Section 3 provides:“No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any State, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. But Congress may by a vote of two-thirds of each House, remove such disability.”According to the respondents, Section 3 applies to the former President because after taking the Presidential oath in , he intentionally incited the breaching of the Capitol on January 6 in order to retain power. They claim that he is therefore not a qualified candidate, and that as a result, the Colorado secretary of state may not place him on the primary ballot. See Colo. Rev. Stat. §§1–1–(1), 1–4–(1), 1–4–, 1–4–(2)(a), 1–4– ().After a five-day trial, the state District Court found that former President Trump had “engaged in insurrection” within the meaning of Section 3, but nonetheless denied the respondents’ petition. The court held that Section 3 did not apply because the Presidency, which Section 3 does not mention by name, is not an “office . . . under the United States” and the President is not an “officer of the United States” within the meaning of that provision. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 184a–284a.In December, the Colorado Supreme Court reversed in part and affirmed in part by a 4 to 3 vote. Reversing the District Court’s operative holding, the majority concluded that for purposes of Section 3, the Presidency is an office under the United States and the President is an officer of the United States. The court otherwise affirmed, holding (1) that the Colorado Election Code permitted the respondents’ challenge based on Section 3; (2) that Congress need not pass implementing legislation for disqualifications under Section 3 to attach; (3) that the political question doctrine did not preclude judicial review of former President Trump’s eligibility; (4) that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in admitting into evidence portions of a congressional Report on the events of January 6; (5) that the District Court did not err in concluding that those events constituted an “insurrection” and that former President Trump “engaged in” that insurrection; and (6) that former President Trump’s speech to the crowd that breached the Capitol on January 6 was not protected by the First Amendment. Seeid., at 1a–114a.The Colorado Supreme Court accordingly ordered Secretary Griswold not to “list President Trump’s name on the presidential primary ballot” or “count any write-in votes cast for him.”Id., at 114a. Chief [REDACTED] and Justices Samour and Berkenkotter each filed dissenting opinions.Id., at 115a–124a, 125a–161a, 162a–183a.Under the terms of the opinion of the Colorado Supreme Court, its ruling was automatically stayed pending this Court’s review. Seeid., at 114a. We granted former President Trump’s petition for certiorari, which raised a single question: “Did the Colorado Supreme Court err in ordering President Trump excluded from the presidential primary ballot?” See U. S. Concluding that it did, we now reverse.IIAProposed by Congress in and ratified by the States in , the Fourteenth Amendment “expand[ed] federal power at the expense of state autonomy” and thus “fundamentally altered the balance of state and federal power struck by the Constitution.”Seminole Tribe of Fla.v.Florida, U.S. , (); see alsoEx parte Virginia, U.S. , (). Section 1 of the Amendment, for instance, bars the States from “depriv[ing] any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law” or “deny[ing] to any person . . . the equal protection of the laws.” And Section 5 confers on Congress “power to enforce” those prohibitions, along with the other provisions of the Amendment, “by appropriate legislation.”Section 3 of the Amendment likewise restricts state autonomy, but through different means. It was designed to help ensure an enduring Union by preventing former Confederates from returning to power in the aftermath of the Civil War. See,e.g., Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., () (statement of Rep. Stevens, warning that without appropriate constitutional reforms “yelling secessionists and hissing copperheads” would take seats in the House);id., at (statement of Sen. Howard, lamenting prospect of a “State Legislature . . . made up entirely of disloyal elements” absent a disqualification provision). Section 3 aimed to prevent such a resurgence by barring from office “those who, having once taken an oath to support the Constitution of the United States, afterward went into rebellion against the Government of the United States.” Cong. Globe, 41st Cong., 1st Sess., () (statement of Sen. Trumbull).Section 3 works by imposing on certain individuals a preventive and severe penalty—disqualification from holding a wide array of offices—rather than by granting rights to all. It is therefore necessary, as Chief [REDACTED] concluded and the Colorado Supreme Court itself recognized, to “ ‘ascertain[ ] what particular individuals are embraced’ ” by the provision. App. to Pet. for Cert. 53a (quotingGriffin’s Case, F. Cas. 7, (No. 5,) (CC Va. ) (Chase, Circuit Justice)). Chase went on to explain that “[t]o accomplish this ascertainment and ensure effective results, proceedings, evidence, decisions, and enforcements of decisions, more or less formal, are indispensable.”Id., at . For its part, the Colorado Supreme Court also concluded that there must be some kind of “determination” that Section 3 applies to a particular person “before the disqualification holds meaning.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 53a.The Constitution empowers Congress to prescribe how those determinations should be made. The relevant provision is Section 5, which enables Congress, subject of course to judicial review, to pass “appropriate legislation” to “enforce” the Fourteenth Amendment. SeeCity of Boernev.Flores, U.S. , (). Or as Senator Howard put it at the time the Amendment was framed, Section 5 “casts upon Congress the responsibility of seeing to it, for the future, that all the sections of the amendment are carried out in good faith.” Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., at .Congress’s Section 5 power is critical when it comes to Section 3. Indeed, during a debate on enforcement legislation less than a year after ratification, Sen. Trumbull noted that “notwithstanding [Section 3] . . . hundreds of men [were] holding office” in violation of its terms. Cong. Globe, 41st Cong., 1st Sess., at . The Constitution, Trumbull noted, “provide[d] no means for enforcing” the disqualification, necessitating a “bill to give effect to the fundamental law embraced in the Constitution.”Ibid.The enforcement mechanism Trumbull championed was later enacted as part of the Enforcement Act of , “pursuant to the power conferred by §5 of the [Fourteenth] Amendment.”General Building Contractors Assn., Inc.v.Pennsylvania, U.S. , (); see 16Stat. –.BThis case raises the question whether the States, in addition to Congress, may also enforce Section 3. We conclude that States may disqualify persons holding or attempting to holdstateoffice. But States have no power under the Constitution to enforce Section 3 with respect to federal offices, especially the Presidency.“In our federal system, the National Government possesses only limited powers; the States and the people retain the remainder.”Bondv.United States, U.S. , (). Among those retained powers is the power of a State to “order the processes of its own governance.”Aldenv.Maine, U.S. , (). In particular, the States enjoy sovereign “power to prescribe the qualifications of their own officers” and “the manner of their election . . . free from external interference, except so far as plainly provided by the Constitution of the United States.”Taylorv.Beckham, U.S. , – (). Although the Fourteenth Amendment restricts state power, nothing in it plainly withdraws from the States this traditional authority. And after ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment, States used this authority to disqualify state officers in accordance with state statutes. See,e.g.,Worthyv.[REDACTED], N. C. , , () (elected county sheriff );State ex rel. Sandlinv.Watkins, La. Ann. , – () (state judge).Such power over governance, however, does not extend tofederalofficeholders and candidates. Because federal officers “ ‘owe their existence and functions to the united voice of the whole, not of a portion, of the people,’ ” powers over their election and qualifications must be specifically “delegated to, rather than reserved by, the States.”U. S. Term Limits, Inc.v.Thornton, U.S. , – () (quoting 1 J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States §, p. (3d ed. )). But nothing in the Constitution delegates to the States any power to enforce Section 3 against federal officeholders and candidates.As an initial matter, not even the respondents contend that the Constitution authorizes States to somehow removesittingfederal officeholders who may be violating Section 3. Such a power would flout the principle that “the Constitution guarantees ‘the entire independence of the General Government from any control by the respective States.’ ”Trumpv.Vance, U.S. , () (quotingFarmers and Mechanics Sav. Bank of Minneapolisv.Minnesota, U.S. , ()). Indeed, consistent with that principle, States lack even the lesser powers to issue writs of mandamus against federal officials or to grant habeas corpus relief to persons in federal custody. SeeMcClungv.Silliman, 6 Wheat. , – ();Tarble’s Case, Wall. , – ().The respondents nonetheless maintain that States may enforce Section 3 againstcandidatesfor federal office. But the text of the Fourteenth Amendment, on its face, does not affirmatively delegate such a power to the States. The terms of the Amendment speak only to enforcement by Congress, which enjoys power to enforce the Amendment through legislation pursuant to Section 5.This can hardly come as a surprise, given that the substantive provisions of the Amendment “embody significant limitations on state authority.”Fitzpatrickv.Bitzer, U.S. , (). Under the Amendment, States cannot abridge privileges or immunities, deprive persons of life, liberty, or property without due process, deny equal protection, or deny male inhabitants the right to vote (without thereby suffering reduced representation in the House). See Amdt. , §§1, 2. On the other hand, the Fourteenth Amendment grants new power to Congress to enforce the provisions of the Amendment against the States. It would be incongruous to read this particular Amendment as granting the States the power—silently no less—to disqualify a candidate for federal office.The only other plausible constitutional sources of such a delegation are the Elections and Electors Clauses, which authorize States to conduct and regulate congressional and Presidential elections, respectively. See Art. I, §4, cl. 1; Art. II, §1, cl. 2.[1] But there is little reason to think that these Clauses implicitly authorize the States to enforce Section 3 against federal officeholders and candidates. Granting the States that authority would invert the Fourteenth Amendment’s rebalancing of federal and state power.The text of Section 3 reinforces these conclusions. Its final sentence empowers Congress to “remove” any Section 3 “disability” by a two-thirds vote of each house. The text imposes no limits on that power, and Congress may exercise it any time, as the respondents concede. See Brief for Respondents . In fact, historically, Congress sometimes exercised this amnesty power postelection to ensure that some of the people’s chosen candidates could take office.[2] But if States were free to enforce Section 3 by barring candidates from running in the first place, Congress would be forced to exercise its disability removal power before voting begins if it wished for its decision to have any effect on the current election cycle. Perhaps a State may burden congressional authority in such a way when it exercises its “exclusive” sovereign power over its own state offices.Taylor, U. S., at . But it is implausible to suppose that the Constitution affirmatively delegated to the States the authority to impose such a burden on congressional power with respect to candidates for federal office. Cf.McCullochv.Maryland, 4 Wheat. , () (“States have no power . . . to retard, impede, burden, or in any manner control, the operations of the constitutional laws enacted by Congress”).Nor have the respondents identified any tradition of state enforcement of Section 3 against federal officeholders or candidates in the years following ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment.[3] Such a lack of historical precedent is generally a “ ‘telling indication’ ” of a “ ‘severe constitutional problem’ ” with the asserted power.United Statesv.Texas, U.S. , () (quotingFree Enterprise Fundv.Public Company Accounting Oversight Bd., U.S. , ()). And it is an especially telling sign here, because as noted, Statesdiddisqualify persons from holding state offices following ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment. That pattern of disqualification with respect to state, but not federal offices provides “persuasive evidence of a general understanding” that the States lacked enforcement power with respect to the latter.U. S. Term Limits, U. S., at .Instead, it is Congress that has long given effect to Section 3 with respect to would-be or existing federal officeholders. Shortly after ratification of the Amendment, Congress enacted the Enforcement Act of . That Act authorized federal district attorneys to bring civil actions in federal court to remove anyone holding nonlegislative office—federal or state—in violation of Section 3, and made holding or attempting to hold office in violation of Section 3 a federal crime. §§, , 16Stat. – (repealed, 35Stat. –, 62Stat. –). In the years following ratification, the House and Senate exercised their unique powers under Article I to adjudicate challenges contending that certain prospective or sitting Members could not take or retain their seats due to Section 3. See Art. I, §5, cls. 1, 2; 1 A. Hinds, Precedents of the House of Representatives §§–, pp. – (). And the Confiscation Act of , which predated Section 3, effectively provided an additional procedure for enforcing disqualification. That law made engaging in insurrection or rebellion, among other acts, a federal crime punishable by disqualification from holding office under the United States. See §§2, 3, 12Stat. . A successor to those provisions remains on the books today. See U. S. C. §.Moreover, permitting state enforcement of Section 3 against federal officeholders and candidates would raise serious questions about the scope of that power. Section 5 limitscongressionallegislation enforcing Section 3, because Section 5 is strictly “remedial.”City of Boerne, U. S., at . To comply with that limitation, Congress “must tailor its legislative scheme to remedying or preventing” the specific conduct the relevant provision prohibits.Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd.v.College Savings Bank, U.S. , (). Section 3, unlike other provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment, proscribes conduct of individuals. It bars persons from holding office after taking a qualifying oath and then engaging in insurrection or rebellion—nothing more. Any congressional legislation enforcing Section 3 must, like the Enforcement Act of and §, reflect “congruence and proportionality” between preventing or remedying that conduct “and the means adopted to that end.”City of Boerne, U. S., at . Neither we nor the respondents are aware of any other legislation by Congress to enforce Section 3. See Tr. of Oral Arg. .Any state enforcement of Section 3 against federal officeholders and candidates, though, would not derive from Section 5, which confers power only on “[t]he Congress.” As a result, such state enforcement might be argued to sweep more broadly than congressional enforcement could under our precedents. But the notion that the Constitution grants the States freer rein than Congress to decide how Section 3 should be enforced with respect to federal offices is simply implausible.Finally, state enforcement of Section 3 with respect to the Presidency would raise heightened concerns. “[I]n the context of a Presidential election, state-imposed restrictions implicate a uniquely important national interest.”Andersonv.Celebrezze, U.S. , – () (footnote omitted). But state-by-state resolution of the question whether Section 3 bars a particular candidate for President from serving would be quite unlikely to yield a uniform answer consistent with the basic principle that “the President . . . represent[s]allthe voters in the Nation.”Id., at (emphasis added).Conflicting state outcomes concerning the same candidate could result not just from differing views of the merits, but from variations in state law governing the proceedings that are necessary to make Section 3 disqualification determinations. Some States might allow a Section 3 challenge to succeed based on a preponderance of the evidence, while others might require a heightened showing. Certain evidence (like the congressional Report on which the lower courts relied here) might be admissible in some States but inadmissible hearsay in others. Disqualification might be possible only through criminal prosecution, as opposed to expedited civil proceedings, in particular States. Indeed, in some States—unlike Colorado (or Maine, where the secretary of state recently issued an order excluding former President Trump from the primary ballot)—procedures for excluding an ineligible candidate from the ballot may not exist at all. The result could well be that a single candidate would be declared ineligible in some States, but not others, based on the same conduct (and perhaps even the same factual record).The “patchwork” that would likely result from state enforcement would “sever the direct link that the Framers found so critical between the National Government and the people of the United States” as a whole.U. S. Term Limits, U. S., at . But in a Presidential election “the impact of the votes cast in each State is affected by the votes cast”—or, in this case, the votes not allowed to be cast—“for the various candidates in other States.”Anderson, U. S., at . An evolving electoral map could dramatically change the behavior of voters, parties, and States across the country, in different ways and at different times. The disruption would be all the more acute—and could nullify the votes of millions and change the election result—if Section 3 enforcement were attempted after the Nation has voted. Nothing in the Constitution requires that we endure such chaos—arriving at any time or different times, up to and perhaps beyond the Inauguration.* * *For the reasons given, responsibility for enforcing Section 3 against federal officeholders and candidates rests with Congress and not the States. The judgment of the Colorado Supreme Court therefore cannot stand.All nine Members of the Court agree with that result. Our colleagues writing separately further agree with many of the reasons this opinion provides for reaching it. Seepost, Part I (joint opinion of [REDACTED], [REDACTED], and [REDACTED], JJ.); see alsopost, p. 1 (opinion of [REDACTED], J.). So far as we can tell, they object only to our taking into account the distinctive way Section 3 works and the fact that Section 5 vestsin Congressthe power to enforce it. These are not the only reasons the States lack power to enforce this particular constitutional provision with respect to federal offices. But they are important ones, and it is the combination of all the reasons set forth in this opinion—not, as some of our colleagues would have it, just one particular rationale—that resolves this case. In our view, each of these reasons is necessary to provide a complete explanation for the judgment the Court unanimously reaches.The judgment of the Colorado Supreme Court is reversed.The mandate shall issue forthwith.It is so ordered.Notes1The Elections Clause directs, in relevant part, that “[t]he Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof.” Art. I, §4, cl. 1. The Electors Clause similarly provides that “[e]ach State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors,” who in turn elect the President. Art. II, §1, cl. 2.2Shortly after the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified, for instance, Congress enacted a private bill to remove the Section 3 disability of Nelson Tift of Georgia, who had recently been elected to represent the State in Congress. See ch. , 15Stat. . Tift took his seat in Congress immediately thereafter. See Cong. Globe, 40th Cong., 2d Sess., – (). Congress similarly acted postelection to remove the disabilities of persons elected to state and local offices. See Cong. Globe, 40th Cong., 3d Sess., –, – (); ch. 5, 15Stat. –.3We are aware of just one example of state enforcement against a would-be federal officer. In , the Governor of Georgia refused to commission John Christy, who had won the most votes in a congressional election, because—in the Governor’s view—Section 3 made Christy ineligible to serve. But the Governor’s determination was not final; a committee of the House reviewed Christy’s qualifications itself and recommended that he not be seated. The full House never acted on the matter, and Christy was never seated. See 1 A. Hinds, Precedents of the House of Representatives §, pp. – ()."}
{"file_name": "per curiam_2014_21_574.json", "author": "per curiam", "year": 2014, "text": "– Decided November , 2014Per Curiam.Over days in April , respondent Joshua Frost helped two associates commit a series of armed robberies in the State of Washington. In the main, Frost drove his confederates to and from their crimes. On one occasion, he also entered the house being robbed. On another, he performed surveillance in anticipation of the robbery.Washington charged Frost with robbery and related offenses. Taking the witness stand, Frost admitted to his involvement, but claimed he acted under duress. As closing arguments drew near, however, Frost’s lawyer expressed the desire to contend both (1) that the State failed to meet its burden of proving that Frost was an accomplice to the crimes and (2) that Frost acted under duress. The trial judge insisted that the defense choose between these alternative arguments, explaining that state law prohib-ited a defendant from simultaneously contesting the elements of the crime and presenting the affirmative defense of duress. So Frost’s lawyer limited his summation to duress. The jury convicted Frost of six counts of robbery, one count of attempted robbery, one count of burglary, and two counts of assault.The Washington Supreme Court sustained Frost’s conviction. It rejected the trial court’s view that state law prohibited Frost from simultaneously contesting criminal liability and arguing duress.Statev.Frost, Wash. 2d , –, P.3d , – () (en banc). By preventing the defense from presenting both theories during summation, it said, the trial court violated the National Constitution’s Due Process and Assistance of Counsel Clauses.Id.,at –, P. 3d, at –. But the State Supreme Court continued, this improper restriction of closing argument qualified as a trial error (a mistake reviewable for harmlessness) rather than a structural error (a mistake that requires automatic reversal).Id.,at –, P. 3d, at –. Because the jury heard three taped confessions and Frost’s admission of guilt on the witness stand, and because it received proper instructions on the State’s burden of proof, the State Supreme Court held that any error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.Id.,at –, P. 3d, at –.Frost filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus under U. S. C. §. The District Court dismissed the petition, App. to Pet. for Cert. 76a, and a panel of the Court of Appeals affirmed,Frostv.Van Boening, F.3d ( ). But the Court of Appeals en banc reversed and instructed the District Court to grant relief. F.3d ().Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of (AEDPA), the Court of Appeals had power to grant Frost habeas corpus only if the Washington Supreme Court’s decision “was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,” or “was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.” U. S. C. §(d). Here, the Ninth Circuit held that the Washington Supreme Court unreasonably applied clearly established federal law by failing to classify the trial court’s restriction of closing argument as structural error.That decision cannot stand. Assuming for argument’s sake that the trial court violated the Constitution, it was not clearly established that its mistake ranked as structural error.Mostconstitutional mistakes call for reversal only if the government cannot demonstrate harmlessness.Nederv.United States, U.S. 1, 8 (). Only the rare type of error—in general, one that “ ‘infect[s] the entire trial process’ ” and “ ‘necessarily render[s] [it] fundamentally unfair’ ”—requires automatic reversal.Ibid.None of our cases clearly requires placing improper restriction of closing argument in this narrow category.The Ninth Circuit claimed that the Washington Supreme Court contradictedHerringv.New York, U.S. ().Herringheld that complete denial of summation violates the Assistance of Counsel Clause. According to the Ninth Circuit,Herringfurther held that this denial amounts to structural error. We need not opine on the accuracy of that interpretation. For even assuming thatHerringestablished thatcomplete denialof summation amounts to structural error, it did not clearly establish that therestrictionof summation also amounts to structural error. A court could reasonably conclude, after all, that prohibiting all argument differs from prohibiting argument in the alternative. That is all the more true because our structural-error cases “ha[ve] not been characterized by [an] ‘in for a penny, in for a pound’ approach.”Neder,supra, at , n. 2.Attempting to bridge the gap betweenHerringand this case, the Ninth Circuit cited two Circuit precedents—United Statesv.Miguel, F.3d ( ), andCondev.Henry, F.3d ( )—for the proposition that “preventing a defendant from arguing a legitimate defense theory constitutes structural error.” F. 3d, at . As we have repeatedly emphasized, how-ever, circuit precedent does not constitute “clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court.” §(d)(1); see,e.g.,Lopezv.Smith, U. S., at 6). The Ninth Circuit acknowledged this rule, but tried to get past it by claiming that circuit precedent could “ ‘help . . . determine what law is “clearly established.” ’ ” F. 3d, at , n. 1. But neitherMiguelnorCondearose under AEDPA, so neither purports to reflect the law clearly established by this Court’s holdings. The Ninth Circuit thus had no justification for relying on those decisions. SeeParkerv.Matthews, U. S., at ).The second rationale for the Court of Appeals’ decision is no more sound than the first. The Ninth Circuit reasoned that, by allowing the prosecution to argue that it had proved the elements of the crimes, but “prohibit[ing]” the defense from responding that it had not, the trial court in effect “forc[ed] defense counsel to concede his client’s guilt.” F. 3d, at . By extracting this “conce[ssion],” the Ninth Circuit continued, the trial court “relieved the State of its burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt,” “shifted the burden of proof to Frost,” and even “directed [a] verdict on guilt”—all “unquestionably structural [errors].”Id.,at –.No. The trial court, to begin, did not prohibit the defense from arguing that the prosecution failed to prove the elements of the crime. It instead precluded the defense fromsimultaneouslycontesting reasonable doubt and claiming duress. Reasonable minds could disagree whether requiring the defense to choose between alternative theories amounts to requiring the defense to concede guilt. Still more could they disagree whether it amounts to eliminating the prosecution’s burden of proof, shifting the burden to the defendant, or directing a verdict. In addition, even if the trial court’s ruling somehow “forced” the defense “at least tacitly [to] admit the elements of the crimes,”id.,at , the Ninth Circuit still would have no basis for ruling as it did. It goes much too far to suggest that our cases clearly establish that this supposed extraction of a “taci[t] admi[ssion]” is structural error, when they classify the introduction of acoerced confessiononly as trial error,Arizonav.Fulminante, U.S. , ().* * *Frost argued below that, even if it was reasonable for the State Supreme Court to treat improper restriction of summation as trial error, it was unreasonable for it to find harmlessness on the facts of this case. The Court of Appeals did not address this argument when sitting en banc, and it is not before us today.We grant the petition for a writ of certiorari and respondent’s motion to proceedin forma pauperis. We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered."}

Urging that the prosecution failed to disclose evidence supporting his innocence and that his counsel provided ineffective assistance at trial, Wearry unsuccessfully sought postconviction relief in state court. Contrary to the state postconviction court, we conclude that the prosecution’s failure to disclose material evidence violated Wearry’s due process rights. We reverse the state postconviction court’s judgment on that account, and therefore do not reach Wearry’s ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim.IASometime between 8: and 9: on the evening of April 4, , Eric Walber was brutally murdered. Nearly two years after the murder, Sam Scott, at the time incarcerated, contacted authorities and implicated Michael Wearry. Scott initially reported that he had been friends withthe victim; that he was at work the night of the murder; that the victim had come looking for him but had instead run into Wearry and four others; and that Wearry and the others had later confessed to shooting and driving over the victim before leaving his body on Blahut Road. In fact, the victim had not been shot, and his body had been found on Crisp Road.Scott changed his account of the crime over the course of four later statements, each of which differed from the others in material ways. By the time Scott testified as the State’s star witness at Wearry’s trial, his story bore little resemblance to his original account. According to the version Scott told the jury, he had been playing dice with Wearry and others when the victim drove past. Wearry, who had been losing, decided to rob the victim. After Wearry and an acquaintance, Randy Hutchinson, stopped the victim’s car, Hutchinson shoved the victim into the cargo area. Five men, including Scott, Hutchinson, and Wearry, proceeded to drive around, at one point encountering Eric Brown—the State’s other main witness—and pausing intermittently to assault the victim. Finally, Scott related, Wearry and two others killed the victim by running him over. On cross-examination, Scott admitted that he had changed his account several times.Consistent with Scott’s testimony, Brown testified that on the night of the murder he had seen Wearry and others with a man who looked like the victim. Incarcerated on unrelated charges at the time of Wearry’s trial, Brown acknowledged that he had made a prior inconsistent statement to the police, but had recanted and agreed to testify against Wearry, not for any prosecutorial favor, but solely because his sister knew the victim’s sister. The State commented during its opening argument that Brown “is doing years on a drug charge right now, [but] hasn’t asked for a thing.” 7 Record (Tr., Mar. 2, ). During closing argument, the State reiterated that Brown “has no deal on the table” and was testifying because the victim’s “family deserves to know.” Pet. for Cert. .Although the State presented no physical evidence at trial, it did offer additional circumstantial evidence linking Wearry to the victim. One witness testified that he saw Wearry in the victim’s car on the night of the murder and, later, holding the victim’s class ring. Another witness said he saw Wearry throwing away the victim’s cologne. In some respects, however, these witnesses contradicted Scott’s account. For example, the witness who reported seeing Wearry in the victim’s car did not place Scott in the car.Wearry’s defense at trial rested on an alibi. He claimed that, at the time of the murder, he had been at a wedding reception in Baton Rouge, miles away. Wearry’s girlfriend, her sister, and her aunt corroborated Wearry’s account. In closing argument, the State stressed that all three witnesses had personal relationships with Wearry. The State also presented two rebuttal witnesses: the bride at the wedding, who reported that the reception had ended by 8: or 9: (potentially leaving sufficient time for Wearry to have committed the crime); and three jail employees, who testified that they had overheard Wearry say that he was a bystander when the crime occurred.The jury convicted Wearry of capital murder and sentenced him to death. His conviction and sentence were affirmed on direct appeal.[1]BAfter Wearry’s conviction became final, it emerged that the prosecution had withheld relevant information that could have advanced Wearry’s plea. Wearry argued during state postconviction proceedings that three categories of belatedly revealed information would have undermined the prosecution and materially aided Wearry’s defense at trial.First, previously undisclosed police records showed that two of Scott’s fellow inmates had made statements that cast doubt on Scott’s credibility. One inmate had reported hearing Scott say that he wanted to “ ‘make sure [Wearry] gets the needle cause he jacked over me.’ ”Id., at (quoting inmate affidavit).[2] The other inmate had told investigators—at a meeting Scott orchestrated—that he had witnessed the murder, but this inmate recanted the next day. “Scott had told him what to say,” he explained, and had suggested that lying about having witnessed the murder “would help him get out of jail.” Pet. Exh. in No. –FELN–, pp. , . See also Pet. for Cert. (quoting police notes).Second, the State had failed to disclose that, contrary to the prosecution’s assertions at trial, Brown had twice sought a deal to reduce his existing sentence in exchange for testifying against Wearry. The police had told Brown that they would “ ‘talk to the D. A. if he told the truth.’ ” Pet. for Cert. (quoting police notes).Third, the prosecution had failed to turn over medical records on Randy Hutchinson. According to Scott, on the night of the murder, Hutchinson had run into the street to flag down the victim, pulled the victim out of his car, shoved him into the cargo space, and crawled into the cargo space himself. But Hutchinson’s medical records revealed that, nine days before the murder, Hutchinson had undergone knee surgery to repair a ruptured patellar tendon.Id.,at –, –, .[3] An expert witness, Dr. Paul Dworak, testified at the state collateral-review hearing that Hutchinson’s surgically repaired knee could not have withstood running, bending, or lifting substantial weight. The State presented an expert witness who disagreed with Dr. Dworak’s appraisal of Hutchinson’s physical fitness.During state postconviction proceedings, Wearry also maintained that his trial attorney had failed to uncover exonerating evidence. Wearry’s trial attorney admitted at the state collateral-review hearing that he had conducted no independent investigation into Wearry’s innocence and had relied solely on evidence the State and Wearry had provided.[4] For example, despite Wearry’s alibi, his attorney undertook no effort to locate independent witnesses from among the dozens of guests who had attended the wedding reception.Counsel representing Wearry on collateral review conducted an independent investigation. This investigation revealed many witnesses lacking any personal relationship with Wearry who would have been willing to corroborate his alibi had they been called at trial. Collateral-review counsel’s investigation also revealed that Scott’s brother and sister-in-law would have been willing to tes-tify at trial, as they did at the collateral-review hearing, that Scott was with them, mostly at a strawberry festival, until around : on the night of the murder.Based on this new evidence, Wearry alleged violations of his due process rights underBradyv.Maryland, U. S. () , and of his Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel. Acknowledging that the State “probably ought to have” disclosed the withheld evidence, App. to Pet. for Cert. B–6, and that Wearry’s counsel provided “perhaps not the best defense that could have been rendered,”id.,at B–5, the postconviction court denied relief. Even if Wearry’s constitutional rights were violated, the court concluded, he had not shown prejudice.Id.,at B–5, B–7. In turn, the Louisiana Supreme Court also denied relief.Id.,at A–1. Chief [REDACTED] would have granted Wearry’s petition on the ground that he received ineffective assistance of counsel.Id.,at A–2.[5]IIBecause we conclude that the Louisiana courts’ denial of Wearry’sBradyclaim runs up against settled constitutional principles, and because a new trial is required as a result, we need not and do not consider the merits of his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim. “[T]he suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.”Brady,supra, at . See alsoGigliov.United States, U. S. – () (clarifying that the rule stated inBradyapplies to evidence undermining witness credibility). Evidence qualifies as material when there is “ ‘any reasonable likelihood’ ” it could have “ ‘affected the judgment of the jury.’ ”Giglio,supra, at (quotingNapuev.Illinois, U. S. , () ). To prevail on hisBradyclaim, Wearry need not show that he “more likely than not” would have been acquitted had the new evidence been admitted.Smithv.Cain, U. S., at 2–3) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). He must show only that the new evidence is sufficient to “undermine confidence” in the verdict.Ibid.[6]Beyond doubt, the newly revealed evidence suffices to undermine confidence in Wearry’s conviction. The State’s trial evidence resembles a house of cards, built on the jury crediting Scott’s account rather than Wearry’s alibi. SeeUnited Statesv.Agurs, U. S. , () (“[I]f the verdict is already of questionable validity, additional evidence of relatively minor importance might be sufficient to create a reasonable doubt.”). The dissent asserts that, apart from the testimony of Scott and Brown, there was independent evidence pointing to Wearry as the murderer. Seepost,at 5 (opinion of [REDACTED], J.). But all of the evidence the dissent cites suggests, at most, that someone in Wearry’s group of friends may have committed the crime, and that Wearry may have been involved in events related to the murderafterit occurred. Perhaps, on the basis of this evidence, Louisiana might have charged Wearry as an accessory after the fact. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §: (West ) (providing a maximum prison term of five years for accessories after the fact). But Louisiana instead charged Wearry with capital murder, and the only evidence directly tying him to that crime was Scott’s dubious testimony, corroborated by the similarly suspect testimony of Brown.[7]As the dissent recognizes, “Scott did not have an exemplary record of veracity.”Post,at 3. Scott’s credibility, already impugned by his many inconsistent stories, would have been further diminished had the jury learned that Hutchinson may have been physically incapable of performing the role Scott ascribed to him, that Scott had coached another inmate to lie about the murder and thereby enhance his chances to get out of jail, or that Scott may have implicated Wearry to settle a personal score.[8] Moreover, any juror who found Scott more credible in light of Brown’s testimony might have thought differently had she learned that Brown may have been motivated to come forward not by his sister’s relationship with the victim’s sister—as the prosecution had insisted in its closing argument—but by the possibility of a reduced sentence on an existing conviction. SeeNapue,supra, at (even though the State had made no binding promises, a witness’ attempt to obtain a deal before testifying was material because the jury “might well have concluded that [the witness] had fabricated testimony in order to curry the [prosecution’s] favor”). Even if the jury—armed with all of this new evidence—couldhave voted to convict Wearry, we have “no confidence that itwouldhave done so., at 3).Reaching the opposite conclusion, the state postconviction court improperly evaluated the materiality of each piece of evidence in isolation rather than cumulatively, seeKylesv.Whitley, U. S. , () (requiring a “cumulative evaluation” of the materiality of wrongfully withheld evidence), emphasized reasons a juror might disregard new evidence while ignoring reasons she might not, cf.Porterv.McCollum, U. S. , () (per curiam) (“it was not reasonable to discount entirely the effect that [a defendant’s expert’s] testimony might have had on the jury” just because the State’s expert provided contrary testimony), and failed even to mention the statements of the two inmates impeaching Scott.IIIIn addition to defending the judgment of the Louisiana courts, the dissent criticizes the Court for deciding this “intensely factual question . . . without full briefing and argument.”Post,at 6. But the Court has not shied away from summarily deciding fact-intensive cases where, as here, lower courts have egregiously misapplied settled law. See,e.g.,Mullenixv.Sims, U. S.Matthews, U. S.Johnson, U. S.Lambert, U. S.Huff, U. S.Upton, U. S. () (per curiam);Porterv.McCollum,supra.Because “[t]he petition does not . . . fall into a category in which the Court has previously evinced an inclination to police factbound errors,” the dissent continues, “nothing warned the State,” when it was drafting its brief in opposition, that the Court might summarily reverse Wearry’s conviction.Post,at 5–6. Contrary to the dissent, however, summarily deciding a capital case, when circumstances so warrant, is hardly unprecedented. SeeSears,supra,at – (vacating a state postconviction court’s denial of relief on a penalty-phase ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim);Porter,supra,at – (attorney provided ineffective assistance of counsel by conducting a constitutionally inadequate investigation into mitigating evidence). Perhaps anticipating the possibility of summary reversal, the State devoted the bulk of its -page brief in opposition to a point-by-point rebuttal of Wearry’s claims. Given this brief, as well as the State’s lower court filings similarly concentrating on evidence supporting its position, the chances that further briefing or argument would change the outcome are vanishingly slim.The dissent also inveighs against the Court’s “depart[ure] from our usual procedures . . . [to] decide petitioner’s fact-intensiveBradyclaim at this stage . . . [rather than] allow[ing] petitioner to raise that claim in a federal habeas proceeding.”Post,at 7. This Court, of course, has jurisdiction over the final judgments of state postconviction courts, see U. S. C. §(a), and exercises that jurisdiction in appropriate circumstances. Earlier this Term, for instance, we heard argument inFosterv.Chatman, No. –, which involves the Georgia courts’ denial of postconviction relief to a capital defendant raising a claim underBatsonv.Kentucky, U. S. () . See alsoSmith, U. S., at 2) (reversing a state postconviction court’s denial of relief on aBradyclaim);Sears,supra,at . Reviewing the Louisiana courts’ denial of postconviction relief is thus hardly the bold departure the dissent paints it to be. The alternative to granting review, after all, is forcing Wearry to endure yet more time on Louisiana’s death row in service of a conviction that is constitutionally flawed.* * *Because Wearry’s due process rights were violated, we grant his petition for a writ of certiorari and motion for leave to proceedin forma pauperis, reverse the judgment of the Louisiana postconviction court, and remand for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.Notes1Wearry argued,inter alia, that the trial court improperly denied his for-cause challenges, and that the prosecution discriminated on the basis of race in jury selection in violation ofBatsonv.Kentucky, U. S. () . Finding both jury-selection claims credible, then-[REDACTED] dissented from the affirmance of Wearry’s conviction.Statev.Weary, – (La. 4/2/), So. 2d , –. (Wearry’s name is misspelled in the direct-appeal case caption.)2Illustrative of the liberties the dissent takes with the record is the assertion that “Scott blamed [Wearry] for putting him in the position of having to admit his own role in the events surrounding the murder.”Post,at 2 (opinion of [REDACTED], J.). Introducing the inmate’s statement, the dissent therefore suggests, might have “backfired by allowing the prosecution to return the jury’s focus to a point the State emphasized often during trial, namely, that Scott’s accusations were credible precisely because Scott had no motive to tell a story that was contrary to his own interests.”Id.,at 2–3.True, according to the inmate, Scott had complained that his identification of Wearry had resulted in a lengthier prison term. The inmate, however, did not suggest that Scott was angry with Wearrybecausehe had suffered adverse consequences as a result of Wearry’s crime. Instead, the inmate separately stated that Scott “wouldn’t tell me who did it”—i.e.,who killed Eric Walber—“but he said I’m gonna make sure Mike gets the needle cause he jacked over me.” Pet. Exh. in No. –FELN–, p. . See alsoibid.(“If [Scott] would have told me who did this I would tell because I have a heart and what they did wasn’t right”). Scott’s refusal to identify Wearry as the culprit—while also endeavoring to “make sure Mike gets the needle,”ibid.—suggests that Wearry didnotcommit the crime, but Scott had decided to bring him down anyway. Nor, contrary to the dissent, is there any reason to believe that Scott anticipated his participation in this case would cost him additional years in prison. Notably, in the first of his five accounts to police, Scott reported that he had not been present at the time of the murder and had learned about it only after the fact. Indeed, it is at least as plausible as the dissent’s hypothesis that Scott believed implicating Wearry might win him early release on his existing conviction.3The dissent emphasizes a State’s witness’ testimony that “Hutchinson had had surgery on his knee ‘about nine days before the homicide happened.’ ”Post,at 4 (quoting Record (Tr., Mar. 5, )). But from this witness’ statement, neither Wearry nor the jury had any way of knowing what the medical records would have revealed: Hutchinson had undergone a patellar-tendon repair rather than a routine minor procedure.4Wearry’s trial attorney did ask the public defender’s investigator to look into the backgrounds of the State’s witnesses and to speak with Wearry’s family members. But the attorney testified at the collateral-review hearing that he did not know what persons the investigator contacted and, in any event, he had serious doubts about the investigator’s qualifications and competence. Moreover, there is no indication that the investigator ever engaged in inquiries regarding Scott’s background or his whereabouts on the night of the murder.5Justice Crichton would have granted Wearry’s petition and remanded for the trial court to address his claim of intellectual disability underAtkinsv.Virginia, U. S. () . App. to Pet. for Cert. A–. Wearry does not raise hisAtkinsclaim in his petition for a writ of certiorari.6Given this legal standard, Wearry can prevail even if, as the dissent suggests, the undisclosed information may not have affected the jury’s verdict.7As for the three jailers who testified to overhearing Wearry call himself an “innocent bystander,”post,at 4, so characterizing oneself is the opposite of an admission of guilt.8Because the inmate who told police that Scott may have wanted to settle a score did so close to the end of trial, the State argues, the inmate’s “statement was probably . . . never seen by anyone involved with the actual trial until . . . it was [all] over, i[f] at all.” Brief in Opposition . But “Bradysuppression occurs when the government fails to turn over even evidence that is known only to police investigators and not to the prosecutor.”Youngbloodv.West Virginia, U. S. – () (per curiam) (internal quotation marks omitted). See alsoKylesv.Whitley, U. S. , () (rejecting Louisiana’s plea for a rule that would not hold the State responsible for failing to disclose exculpatory evidence about which prosecutors did not learn until after trial when that evidence was in the possession of police investigators at the time of trial)."}

Decided February , 2018Per Curiam.Three Terms ago, this Court’s decision inM&G Polymers USA, LLCv.Tackett, U. S.”Id., at 1). BeforeTackett, the Sixth Circuit applied a series of “Yard-Maninferences,” stemming from its decision inInternational Union, United Auto, Aerospace, & Agricultural Implement Workers of Am.v.Yard-Man, Inc., F. 2d (). In accord with theYard-Maninferences, courts presumed, in a variety of circumstances, that collective-bargaining agreements vested retiree benefits for life. SeeTackett, U. S., at 7–). ButTackett“reject[ed]” these inferences “as inconsistent with ordinary principles of contract law.”Id., at ).In this case, the Sixth Circuit held that the sameYard-Maninferences it once used to presume lifetime vesting can now be used to render a collective-bargaining agreement ambiguous as a matter of law, thus allowing courts to consult extrinsic evidence about lifetime vesting. F. 3d , – (). This analysis cannot be squared withTackett., at ). Because the Sixth Circuit’s analysis is “Yard-Manre-born, re-built, and re-purposed for new adventures,” F. 3d, at (Sutton, J., dissenting), we reverse.IAThis Court has long held that collective-bargaining agreements must be interpreted “according to ordinary principles of contract law.”Tackett, U. S., at 7) (citingTextile Workersv.Lincoln Mills of Ala., U. S. – ()). Prior toTackett, the Sixth Circuit purported to follow this rule, but it used a unique series of “Yard-Maninferences” that no other circuit applied. U. S., at 7).For example, the Sixth Circuit presumed that “a general durational clause” in a collective-bargaining agreement “ ‘says nothingabout the vesting of retiree benefits’ ” in that agreement.Id., at 9–) (quotingNoev.PolyOne Corp., F. 3d , ( )). If the collective-bargaining agreement lacked “a termination provision specifically addressing retiree benefits” but contained specific termination provisions for other benefits, the Sixth Circuit presumed that the retiree benefits vested for life., at 7–8) (citingYard-Man,supra, at ). The Sixth Circuit also presumed vesting if “a provision . . . ‘tie[d] eligibility for retirement-health benefits to eligibility for a pension.” U. S., at ) (quotingNoe,supra, at ).This Court’s decision inTackett“reject[ed] theYard-Maninferences as inconsistent with ordinary principles of contract law.” U. S., at ). Most obviously, theYard-Maninferences erroneously “refused to apply general durational clauses to provisions governing retiree benefits.” U. S., at ). This refusal “distort[ed] the text of the agreement and conflict[ed] with the principle of contract law that the written agreement is presumed to encompass the whole agreement of the parties.”Ibid.TheYard-Maninferences also incorrectly inferred lifetime vesting whenever “a contract is silent as to the duration of retiree benefits.” U. S., at ). The “traditional principle,”Tackettexplained, is that “ ‘contractual obligations will cease, in the ordinary course, upon termination of the bargaining agreement.’ ”Id., at ) (quotingLitton Financial Printing Div., Litton Business Systems, Inc.v.NLRB, U. S. , () ). “[C]ontracts that are silent as to their duration will ordinarily be treated not as ‘operative in perpetuity’ but as ‘operative for a reasonable time.’ ” U. S., at ) (quoting 3 A. Corbin, Corbin on Contracts §, p. ()). In fact, the Sixth Circuit had followed this principle in cases involving noncollectively bargained agreements, seeSpraguev.General Motors Corp., F. 3d , () (en banc), which “only underscore[d]Yard-Man’s deviation from ordinary principles of contract law., at ).As for the tying of retiree benefits to pensioner status,Tackettrejected thisYard-Maninference as “contrary to Congress’ determination” in the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of (ERISA), 88Stat. . U. S., at ). The Sixth Circuit adopted this inference on the assumption that retiree health benefits are “ ‘a form of delayed compensation or reward for past services,’ ” like a pension.Id., at 4) (quotingYard-Man,supra,at ). But ERISA distinguishes between plans that “resul[t] in a deferral of income,” §(2)(A)(ii), and plans that offer medical benefits, §(1)(A). SeeTackett, U. S., at ).Tackettthus concluded that this and the other “inferences applied inYard-Manand its progeny” do not “represent ordinary principles of contract law.”Id., at ).BLikeTackett, this case involves a dispute between retirees and their former employer about whether an expired collective-bargaining agreement created a vested right to lifetime health care benefits. In , CNH Industrial N. V. and CNH Industrial America LLC (collectively, CNH) agreed to a collective-bargaining agreement. The agreement provided health care benefits under a group benefit plan to certain “[e]mployees who retire under the . . . Pension Plan.” App. to Pet. for Cert. A–. “All other coverages,” such as life insurance, ceased upon retirement.Ibid.The group benefit plan was “made part of” the collective-bargaining agreement and “r[an] concurrently” with it.Id.,at A–. The agreement contained a general durational clause stating that it would terminate in May .Id.,at A–. The agreement also stated that it “dispose[d] of any and all bargaining issues, whether or not presented during negotiations.”Ibid.When the agreement expired in , a class of CNH retirees and surviving spouses (collectively, the retirees) filed this lawsuit, seeking a declaration that their health care benefits vested for life and an injunction preventing CNH from changing them. While their lawsuit was pending, this Court decidedTackett. Based onTackett, the District Court initially awarded summary judgment to CNH. But after reconsideration, it awarded summary judgment to the retirees. F. Supp. 3d (ED Mich. ).The Sixth Circuit affirmed in relevant part. F. 3d, at . The court began by noting that the agreement was “silent” on whether health care benefits vested for life.Id.,at . Although the agreement contained a general durational clause, the Sixth Circuit found that clause inconclusive for two reasons. First, the agreement “carved out certain benefits” like life insurance “and stated that those coverages ceased at a time different than other provisions.”Ibid.; see App. to Pet. for Cert. A–. Second, the agreement “tied” health care benefits to pension eligibility. F. 3d, at ; see App. to Pet. for Cert. A–. These conditions rendered the agreement ambiguous, according to the Sixth Circuit, which allowed it to consult extrinsic evidence. F. 3d, at . And that evidence supported lifetime vesting.Ibid.The Sixth Circuit acknowledged that these features of the agreement are the same ones it used to “infer vesting” underYard-Man, but it concluded that nothing inTackettprecludes this kind of analysis: “There is surely a difference between finding ambiguity from silence and finding vesting from silence.” F. 3d, at .[1]Judge Sutton dissented. Seeid.,at –. He concluded that the agreement was unambiguous because “the company never promised to provide healthcare benefits for life, and the agreement contained a durational clause that limitedallof the benefits.”Id.,at . Judge Sutton noted that, in finding ambiguity, the panel major- ity relied on the same inferences that this Court proscribed inTackett. See F. 3d, at –. But ambiguity, he explained, requires “two competing interpretations, both of which are fairly plausible,”id.,at , and “[a] forbidden inference cannot generate a plausible reading,”id.,at . The panel majority’s contrary decision, Judge Sutton concluded,“abrad[ed] an inter-circuit split (and an intra-circuit split) that the Supreme Court just sutured shut.”Id.,at .[2]IIThe decision below does not comply withTackett’sdirection to apply ordinary contract principles. True, one such principle is that, when a contract is ambiguous, courts can consult extrinsic evidence to determine the parties’ intentions. See U. S., concurring) (slip op., at 1) (citing R. Lord, Williston on Contracts §:7, pp. – (4th ed. ) (Williston)). But a contract is not ambiguous unless, “after applying established rules of interpretation, [it] remains reasonably susceptible to at least two reasonable but conflicting meanings.”Id., §:4, at – (footnote omitted). Here, that means the agreement was not ambiguous unless it could reasonably be read as vesting health care benefits for life.The Sixth Circuit read it that way only by employing the inferences that this Court rejected inTackett. The Sixth Circuit did not point to any explicit terms, implied terms, or industry practice suggesting that the agreement vested health care benefits for life. Cf. U. S., concurring) (slip op., at 2). Instead, it found ambiguity in the agreement by applying several of theYard-Maninferences: It declined to apply the general durational clause to the health care benefits, and then it inferred vesting from the presence of specific termination provisions for other benefits and the tying of health care benefits to pensioner status.Tackettrejected those inferences precisely because they are not “established rules of interpretation,” Williston §:4, at –. TheYard-Maninferences “distort the text of the agreement,” fail “to apply general durational clauses,” erroneously presume lifetime vesting from silence, and contradict how “Congress specifically defined” key terms in ERISA.Tackett, U. S., at –).Tackettthus rejected these inferences not because of theconsequencesthat the Sixth Circuit attached to them—presuming vesting versus finding ambiguity—but because they are not a valid way to read a contract. They cannot be used to create a reasonable interpretation any more than they can be used to create a presumptive one.Tellingly, no other Court of Appeals would find ambigu- ity in these circumstances. When a collective-bargaining agreement is merely silent on the question of vesting, other courts would conclude that it doesnotvest benefits for life.[3] Similarly, when an agreement does not specify a duration for health care benefits in particular, other courts would simply apply the general durational clause.[4] And other courts would not find ambiguity from the tying of retiree benefits to pensioner status.[5] The approach taken in these other decisions “only underscores” how the decision below “deviat[ed] from ordinary principles of contract law., at ).Shorn ofYard-Maninferences, this case is straightforward. The agreement contained a general durational clause that applied to all benefits, unless the agreement specified otherwise. No provision specified that the health care benefits were subject to a different durational clause. The agreement stated that the health benefits plan “r[an] concurrently” with the collective-bargaining agreement, tying the health care benefits to the duration of the rest of the agreement. App. to Pet. for Cert. A–. If the parties meant to vest health care benefits for life, they easily could have said so in the text. But they did not. And they specified that their agreement “dispose[d] of any and all bargaining issues” between them.Id.,at A–. Thus, the only reasonable interpretation of the agree- ment is that the health care benefits expired when the collective-bargaining agreement expired in May . “When the intent of the parties is unambiguously expressed in the contract, that expression controls, and the court’s inquiry should proceed no further., concurring) (slip op., at 1) (citing Williston §:6, at –).* * *Because the decision below is not consistent withTackett, the petition for a writ of certiorari and the motions for leave to file briefsamici curiaeare granted. We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.Notes1After accepting the retirees’ reading of the agreement, the Sixth Circuit remanded for the District Court to reconsider the reasonableness of CNH’s proposed modifications to the health care benefits. See F. 3d , – (). CNH does not challenge that determination, and we express no view on it.2By “intra-circuit split,” Judge Sutton was referring to the Sixth Circuit’s earlier decision inGallov.Moen Inc., F. 3d (). That decision concluded that a collective-bargaining agreement did not vest health care benefits for life, relying on the general durational clause and rejecting the same inferences that the Sixth Circuit invoked here. Seeid.,at –. The conflict between these decisions, and others like them, has led one judge in the Sixth Circuit to declare that “[o]ur post-Tackettcase law is a mess.”International Union, United Auto, Aerospace & Agricultural Implement Workers of Am.v.Kelsey-Hayes Co., F. 3d , () (Griffin, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc). To date, the en banc Sixth Circuit has been unwilling (or unable) to reconcile its precedents. Seeibid.(Sutton, J., concurring in denial of rehearing en banc) (agreeing that this conflict “warrants en banc review” but voting against it because “there is a real possibility that we would not have nine votes for any one [approach]”).3See,e.g.,International Union, United Auto, Aerospace & Agricul-tural Implement Workers of Am.v.Skinner Engine Co., F. 3d , ( );Joycev.Curtiss-Wright Corp., F. 3d , ( );Wisev.El Paso Natural Gas Co., F. 2d , ( );Sennv.United Dominion Industries, Inc., F. 2d , ( ).4See,e.g., Des Moines Mailers Union, Teamsters Local No. 358v.NLRB, F. 3d , ( );Skinner Engine Co., F. 3d, at –.5See,e.g., id.,at ;Joyce,supra, at ;Andersonv.Alpha Portland Industries, Inc., F. 2d , ( )."}

Decided November 2, 2020Per Curiam.Petitioner Trent Taylor is an inmate in the custody of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice. Taylor alleges that, for six full days in September , correctional officers confined him in a pair of shockingly unsanitary cells.[1] The first cell was covered, nearly floor to ceiling, in “ ‘massive amounts’ of feces”: all over the floor, the ceiling, the window, the walls, and even “ ‘packed inside the water faucet.’ ”Taylorv.Stevens, F.3d , ( ). Fearing that his food and water would be contaminated, Taylor did not eat or drink for nearly four days. Correctional officers then moved Taylor to a second, frigidly cold cell, which was equipped with only a clogged drain in the floor to dispose of bodily wastes. Taylor held his bladder for over hours, but he eventually (and involuntarily) relieved himself, causing the drain to overflow and raw sewage to spill across the floor. Because the cell lacked a bunk, and because Taylor was confined without clothing, he was left to sleep naked in sewage.The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit properly held that such conditions of confinement violate the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. But, based on its assessment that “[t]he law wasn’t clearly established” that “prisoners couldn’t be housed in cells teeming with human waste” “for only six days,” the court concluded that the prison officials responsible for Taylor’s confinement did not have “ ‘fair warning’ that their specific acts were unconstitutional.” F. 3d, at (quotingHopev.Pelzer, U.S. , ()).The Fifth Circuit erred in granting the officers qualified immunity on this basis. “Qualified immunity shields an officer from suit when she makes a decision that, even if constitutionally deficient, reasonably misapprehends the law governing the circumstances she confronted.”Brosseauv.Haugen, U.S. , () (per curiam). But no reasonable correctional officer could have concluded that, under the extreme circumstances of this case, it was constitutionally permissible to house Taylor in such deplorably unsanitary conditions for such an extended period of time. SeeHope, U. S., at (explaining that “ ‘a general constitutional rule already identified in the decisional law may apply with obvious clarity to the specific conduct in question’ ” (quotingUnited Statesv.Lanier, U.S. , ())); U. S., at (holding that “[t]he obvious cruelty inherent” in putting inmates in certain wantonly “degrading and dangerous” situations provides officers “with some notice that their alleged conduct violate[s]” the Eighth Amendment). The Fifth Circuit identified no evidence that the conditions of Taylor’s confinement were compelled by necessity or exigency. Nor does the summary-judgment record reveal any reason to suspect that the conditions of Taylor’s confinement could not have been mitigated, either in degree or duration. And although an officer-by-officer analysis will be necessary on remand, the record suggests that at least some officers involved in Taylor’s ordeal were deliberately indifferent to the conditions of his cells. See,e.g., F. 3d, at (one officer, upon placing Taylor in the first feces-covered cell, remarked to another that Taylor was “ ‘going to have a long weekend’ ”);ibid., and n. 9 (another officer, upon placing Taylor in the second cell, told Taylor he hoped Taylor would “ ‘f***ing freeze’ ”).Confronted with the particularly egregious facts of this case, any reasonable officer should have realized that Taylor’s conditions of confinement offended the Constitution.[2] We therefore grant Taylor’s petition for a writ of certiorari, vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.justice [REDACTED] took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.justice [REDACTED] dissents.Notes1The Fifth Circuit accepted Taylor’s “verified pleadings [as] competent evidence at summary judgment.”Taylorv.Stevens, F.3d , (). As is appropriate at the summary-judgment stage, facts that are subject to genuine dispute are viewed in the light most favorable to Taylor’s claim.2In holding otherwise, the Fifth Circuit noted “ambiguity in the caselaw” regarding whether “a time period so short [as six days] violated the Constitution.” F. 3d, at . But the case that troubled the Fifth Circuit is too dissimilar, in terms of both conditions and duration of confinement, to create any doubt about the obviousness of Taylor’s right. SeeDavisv.Scott, F.3d , ( ) (no Eighth Amendment violation where inmate was detained for three days in dirty cell and provided cleaning supplies)."}

Decided January 7, 2008Per Curiam.The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit held that respondent Joseph Van Patten was entitled to relief under U. S. C. §, reasoning that his lawyer’s assistance was presumptively ineffective owing to his participation in a plea hearing by speaker phone.Van Pattenv.Deppisch, F. 3d (). We granted certiorari, vacated the judgment, and remanded the case for further consideration in light ofCareyv.Musladin, U. S. On remand, the Seventh Circuit adhered to its original decision, concluding that “[n]othing inMusladinrequires that our opinion be changed.”Van Pattenv.Endicott, F. 3d , (). We grant the petition for certiorari now before us and this time reverse the judgment of the Seventh Circuit.IVan Patten was charged with first-degree intentional homicide and pleaded no contest to a reduced charge of first-degree reckless homicide. His counsel was not physically present at the plea hearing but was linked to the courtroom by speaker phone. After the state trial court imposed the maximum term of years in prison, Van Patten retained different counsel and moved in the Wisconsin Court of Appeals to withdraw his no-contest plea. The thrust of the motion was that Van Patten’s Sixth Amendment right to counsel had been violated by his trial counsel’s physical absence from the plea hearing. The Wisconsin Court of Appeals noted that, under state law, a postconviction motion to withdraw a no-contest plea will be granted only if a defendant establishes “manifest injustice” by clear and convincing evidence. SeeStatev.Van Pattten,No. ––CR (Wis. App., May , ), App. to Pet. for Cert. –. While the court acknowledged that “the violation of the defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to counsel may constitute a manifest injustice,”id., at , it found that the absence of Van Patten’s lawyer from the plea hearing did not violate his right to counsel:“The plea hearing transcript neither indicates any deficiency in the plea colloquy, nor suggests that Van Patten’s attorney’s participation by telephone interfered in any way with [Van Patten’s] ability to communicate with his attorney about his plea. Van Patten confirmed that he had thoroughly discussed his case and plea decision with his attorney and was satisfied with the legal representation he had received. The court gave Van Patten the opportunity to speak privately with his attorney over the phone if he had questions about the plea, but Van Patten declined. Further, when Van Patten exercised his right to allocution at sentencing, in the personal presence of his attorney, he raised no objection to his plea.”Id., at –.ApplyingStricklandv.Washington, U. S. (), the court concluded that “[t]he record does not support, nor does Van Patten’s appellate brief include, any argument that counsel’s performance was deficient or prejudicial,” No. ––CR, App. to Pet. for Cert. , and denied Van Patten’s motion.After the Wisconsin Supreme Court declined further review, Van Patten petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus under U. S. C. § in Federal District Court. The District Court denied relief, but the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed. It held that Van Patten’s Sixth Amendment claim should have been resolved, not underStrickland’s two-pronged test (which requires a showing of deficient performance and prejudice to the defendant), but under the standard discussed inUnited Statesv.Cronic, U. S. () (under which prejudice may be presumed). Although the Seventh Circuit recognized that this case “presents [a] novel ... question,”Deppisch, F. 3d, at , and conceded that “[u]nderStrickland,it seems clear [that] Van Patten would have no viable claim,”id.,at , the court concluded that “it is clear to us that Van Patten’s case must be resolved underCronic,”id., at . The resolution was in Van Patten’s favor.While the prison warden’s petition for certiorari was pending, this Court decidedMusladin, supra.Musladin had invoked this Court’s cases recognizing “that certain courtroom practices are so inherently prejudicial that they deprive the defendant of a fair trial,”id., at 1). The issue was the significance of these precedents in a case under §, which bars relief on any claim “adjudicated on the merits” in state court, unless the state court’s decision “was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.” U. S. C. §(d)(1).The prejudicial conduct involved inMusladinwas courtroom conduct of private actors. We held that the “inheren[t] prejudic[e]” test, which we thus far have applied only in cases involving government-sponsored conduct, see, e.g.,Estellev.Williams, U. S. ();Holbrookv.Flynn, U. S. (), did not clearly extend to the conduct of independently acting courtroom spectators., at 5) (“[A]lthough the Court articulated the test for inherent prejudice that applies to state conduct inWilliamsandFlynn, we have never applied that test to spectators’ conduct. Indeed, part of the legal test ofWilliamsandFlynn—asking whether the practices furthered an essentialstateinterest—suggests that those cases apply only to state-sponsored practices”). For that reason, we reversed the Court of Appeals’ grant of habeas relief.Musladin’s explanation of the “clearly established Federal law” requirement prompted us to remand Van Patten’s case to the Seventh Circuit for further consideration. A majority of the panel reaffirmed its original judgment, however, on the ground that “[u]nlikeMusladin, this case does not concern an open constitutional question,” because “[t]he Supreme Court has long recognized a defendant’s right to relief if his defense counsel was actually or constructively absent at a critical stage of the proceedings.” F. 3d, at . Judge Coffey disagreed, observing that “the United States Supreme Court has never held that an attorney is presumed to be ineffective if he participates in a plea hearing by speaker phone rather than by physical appearance.”Ibid.(emphasis deleted). He found that “[t]he Majority Opinion does not comport withMusladin,”ibid., and dissented from “the court’s erroneous decision to allow” its original opinion “to stand as written,”id.,at . We reach the same conclusion.IIStricklandv.Washington, U. S. () ordinarily applies to claims of ineffective assistance of counsel at the plea hearing stage. SeeHillv.Lockhart, U. S. , () (“[T]he two-partStricklandv.Washingtontest applies to challenges to guilty pleas based on ineffective assistance of counsel”). And it was in a different context thatCronic“recognized a narrow exception toStrickland’s holding that a defendant who asserts ineffective assistance of counsel must demonstrate not only that his attorney’s performance was deficient, but also that the deficiency prejudiced the defense.”Floridav.Nixon, U. S. , () (discussingCronic).Cronicheld that a Sixth Amendment violation may be found “without inquiring into counsel’s actual performance or requiring the defendant to show the effect it had on the trial,”Bellv.Cone, U. S. , (), when “circumstances [exist] that are so likely to prejudice the accused that the cost of litigating their effect in a particular case is unjustified,”Cronic,supra,at .Cronic, notStrickland, applies “when ... the likelihood that any lawyer, even a fully competent one, could provide effective assistance is so small that a presumption of prejudice is appropriate without inquiry into the actual conduct of the trial,” U. S., at –,* and one circumstance warranting the presumption is the “complete denial of counsel,” that is, when “counsel [is] either totally absent, or prevented from assisting the accused during a critical stage of the proceeding,”id., at , and n. .No decision of this Court, however, squarely addresses the issue in this case, seeDeppisch, supra,at (noting that this case “presents [a] novel ... question”), or clearly establishes thatCronicshould replaceStricklandin this novel factual context. Our precedents do not clearly hold that counsel’s participation by speaker phone should be treated as a “complete denial of counsel,” on par with total absence. Even if we agree with Van Patten that a lawyer physically present will tend to perform better than one on the phone, it does not necessarily follow that mere telephone contact amounted to total absence or “prevented [counsel] from assisting the accused,” so as to entail application ofCronic. The question is not whether counsel in those circumstances will perform less well than he otherwise would, but whether the circumstances are likely to result in such poor performance that an inquiry into its effects would not be worth the time. Cf.United Statesv.Gonzalez-Lopez, U. S., at 7) (Sixth Amendment ensures “effective(not mistake-free) representation” (emphasis in original)). Our cases provide no categorical answer to this question, and for that matter the several proceedings in this case hardly point toward one. The Wisconsin Court of Appeals held counsel’s performance by speaker phone to be constitutionally effective; neither the Magistrate Judge, the District Court, nor the Seventh Circuit disputed this conclusion; and the Seventh Circuit itself stated that “[u]nderStrickland, it seems clear Van Patten would have no viable claim.”Deppisch, F. 3d, at .Because our cases give no clear answer to the question presented, let alone one in Van Patten’s favor, “it cannot be said that the state court ‘unreasonabl[y] appli[ed] clearly established Federal law.’ ”Musladin, U. S., at 6) (quoting U. S. C. §(d)(1)). Under the explicit terms of §(d)(1), therefore, relief is unauthorized.* * *Petitioner tells us that “[i]n urging review, [the State] does not condone, recommend, or encourage the practice of defense counsel assisting clients by telephone rather than in person at court proceedings, even in nonadversarial hearings such as the plea hearing in this case,” Pet. for Cert. 5, and he acknowledges that “[p]erhaps, under similar facts in a direct federal appeal, the Seventh Circuit could have properly reached the same result it reached here,”ibid.Our own consideration of the merits of telephone practice, however, is for another day, and this case turns on the recognition that no clearly established law contrary to the state court’s conclusion justifies collateral relief.The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.*Cronicalso applies when “there [is] a breakdown in the adversarial process,” U. S., at , such that “counsel entirely fails to subject the prosecution’s case to meaningful adversarial testing,”id., at . We have made clear that “[w]hen we spoke inCronicof the possibility of presuming prejudice based on an attorney’s failure to test the prosecutor’s case, we indicated that the attorney’s failure must be complete.”Bellv.Cone, U. S. , – (). It is undisputed that this standard has not been met here."}
{"file_name": "per curiam_2017_16-1468_583.json", "author": "per curiam", "year": 2017, "text": "–. Decided November 6, 2017Per Curiam.The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of provides that a federal court may grant habeas relief to a state prisoner based on a claim adjudicated by a state court on the merits if the resulting decision is “contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.” U. S. C. §(d)(1). In this case, a California court permitted the State to amend a criminal complaint to which the respondent, Michael Cuero, had pleaded guilty. That guilty plea would have led to a maximum sentence of years and 4 months. The court acknowledged that permitting the amendment would lead to a higher sentence, and it consequently permitted Cuero to withdraw his guilty plea. Cuero then pleaded guilty to the amended complaint and was sentenced to a term with a minimum of years.A panel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit subsequently held that the California court had made a mistake of federal law. In its view, the law entitled Cuero to specific performance of the lower -year, 4-month sentence that he would have received had the complaint not been amended.The question here is whether the state-court decision “involved an unreasonable application o[f] clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.”Ibid. Did our prior decisions (1) clearlyrequirethe state court to impose the lower sentence that the parties originally expected; or (2) instead permit the State’s sentence-raising amendment where the defendant was allowed to withdraw his guilty plea? Because no decision from this Court clearly establishes that a state court must choose the first alternative, we reverse the Ninth Circuit’s decision.IOn October , , the State of California charged Michael Cuero with two felonies and a misdemeanor. App. to Pet. for Cert. 26a–33a. Its complaint alleged that on October , , Cuero drove his car into, and seriously injured, Jeffrey Feldman, who was standing outside of his parked pickup truck.Id.,at 27a–28a. The complaint further alleged that Cuero was then on parole, that he was driving without a license, that he was driving under the influence of methamphetamine, and that he had in his possession a loaded 9-millimeter semiautomatic pistol.Ibid.Cuero initially pleaded “not guilty.” But on December 8, he changed his plea. A form entitled “PLEA OF GUILTY/NO CONTEST—FELONY” signed by Cuero, the prosecutor, and the trial court memorialized the terms of Cuero’s guilty plea. Seeid., at 77a–85a. On that form, Cuero pleaded guilty to the two felony counts.Ibid.; see Cal. Veh. Code Ann. §(a) (West ) (causing bodily injury while driving under the influence of a drug); Cal. Penal Code Ann. §(a)(1) (West ) (unlawful possession of a firearm). He also admitted that he had previously served four separate prison terms, including a term for residential burglary, which qualifies as a predicate offense under California’s “three strikes” law. Cal. Penal Code Ann. §(a)(1) (West ); seeEwingv.California, U. S. – (). Finally, Cuero acknowledged on this guilty-plea form that he understood that he “may receive this maximum punishment as a result of my plea: years, 4 months in State Prison, $, fine and 4 years parole.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 80a.Following a hearing, the state trial court accepted the plea and granted California’s motion to dismiss the remaining misdemeanor charge. The court then scheduled the sentencing hearing for January , .Before the hearing took place, however, the prosecution determined that another of Cuero’s four prior convictions qualified as a “strike” and that the signed guilty-plea form had erroneously listed only one strike. See Cal. Penal Code Ann. §(a)(1) (assault with a deadly weapon). This second strike meant that Cuero faced not a maximum punishment of just over years ( months), but aminimumpunishment of years. §§(e)(2)(A)(ii), .(c)(2)(A)(ii).The State asked the trial court for permission to amend the criminal complaint accordingly. It pointed to Cal. Penal Code §.5(a), which provides:“Whenever it shall be discovered that a pending complaint to which a plea of guilty has been made under Section 859a does not charge all prior felonies of which the defendant has been convicted either in this state or elsewhere, the complaint may be forthwith amended to charge the prior conviction or convictions and the amendments may and shall be made upon order of the court.”Cuero argued that the State’s motion was untimely and prejudicial. But the trial court granted the motion. At the same time, the court permitted Cuero to withdraw his guilty plea in light of the change. It concluded that §.5(a) “guide[d]” its inquiry and was best read to reflect a legislative determination that criminal complaints should charge all prior felony convictions. App. to Pet. for Cert. 178a. The court added that the case was distinguishable from “a situation where the [State] might, after a guilty plea, seek to amend” a criminal complaint by adding “new charges” or facts that fundamentally alter the substance of the complaint.Id.,at 179a. But here, where only “alleged prior convictions” were at issue, the court could eliminate any prejudice to Cuero by allowing him to withdraw his initial guilty plea, thereby restoring both parties to the status quo prior to its entry.Ibid.Soon thereafter, California amended the complaint. The complaint as amended charged Cuero with one felony, (causing bodily injury while driving under the influence of a drug under Cal. Veh. Code Ann. §(a)), and it alleged two prior strikes. Cuero then withdrew his initial guilty plea and entered a new guilty plea to the amended complaint. On April , , the trial court sentenced Cuero to the stipulated term of years to life. His conviction and sentence were affirmed on direct appeal, and the California Supreme Court denied a state habeas petition.Cuero then filed a petition for federal habeas relief in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California. The Federal District Court denied Cuero’s petition, but the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed.Cuerov.Cate, F. 3d ().The Ninth Circuit panel hearing the appeal held that the state trial court had “acted contrary to clearly established Supreme Court law” by “refusing to enforce the original plea agreement” with its -month maximum sentence.Id., at . It wrote that “[i]n this context, specific performance” of that plea agreement—i.e.,sentencing Cuero to no more than the roughly -year sentence reflected in the guilty-plea form—was “necessary to maintain the integrity and fairness of the criminal justice system.”Id., at , n. . The Ninth Circuit denied rehearing en banc over the dissent of seven judges.Cuerov.Cate, F. 3d (). The State then filed a petition for certiorari here.IIThe Ninth Circuit has already issued its mandate in this case. And the state trial court, in light of that mandate, has resentenced Cuero. Cuero argues that this fact renders this controversy moot. The State and Cuero, however, continue to disagree about the proper length of Cuero’s sentence, a portion of which he has not yet served. Thus, neither the losing party’s failure to obtain a stay preventing the mandate of the Court of Appeals from issuing nor the trial court’s action in light of that mandate makes the case moot.Mancusiv.Stubbs, U. S. –, and n. 1 ();Eaglesv.United States ex rel. Samuels, U. S. – (). Reversal would simply “und[o] what thehabeas corpuscourt did,” namely, permit the state courts to determine in the first instance the lawfulness of a longer sentence not yet served.Id., at .IIIThe Ninth Circuit, in ordering specific performance of the -month sentence set forth on Cuero’s original guilty-plea form, reasoned as follows. First, the court concluded that Cuero’s guilty-plea form amounts to an enforceable plea agreement. F. 3d, at –. Second, that plea agreement amounts to, and should be interpreted as, a contract under state contract law.Id.,at (citingRickettsv.Adamson, U. S. 1, 5, n. 3 () ). Third, California contract law would consider the State’s motion to amend the complaint as a breach of contract. F. 3d, at –. Fourth, “the remedy for breach must ‘repair the harm caused by the breach.’ ”Id., at (quotingPeoplev.Toscano, Cal. App. 4th , Cal. Rptr. 3d , ()). Fifth, rescission failed to “ ‘repair the harm.’ ” F. 3d, at . Sixth, consequently Cuero was entitled to specific performance, namely, a maximum prison term of months ( years and 4 months).Ibid.And, seventh, the state court’s contrary decision was itself “contrary to, or involved an unreason-able application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.” U. S. C. §(d)(1); see F. 3d, at .We shall assume purely for argument’s sake that the State violated the Constitution when it moved to amend the complaint. But we still are unable to find in Supreme Court precedent that “clearly established federal law” demanding specific performance as a remedy. To the contrary, no “holdin[g] of this Court” requires the remedy of specific performance under the circumstances present here.Harringtonv.Richter, U. S. , () .Two of our prior decisions address these issues. The first,Santobellov.New York, U. S. () , held that a defendant may not be bound to a plea agreement following a prosecutorial breach of an enforceable provision of such an agreement.Id., at . As relevant here, however, Chief [REDACTED] wrote in the opinion for the Court that the “ultimate relief to which petitioner is entitled” must be left “to the discretion of the state court, which is in a better position to decide whether the circumstances of this case require only that there be specific performance of the agreement on the plea” or, alterna-tively, that “the circumstances require granting the relief sought by petitioner,i.e.,the opportunity to withdraw his plea of guilty.”Id., at –.The Ninth Circuit cited a concurrence inSantobelloby [REDACTED], which added that “a court ought to accord a defendant’s [remedial] preference considerable, if not controlling, weight inasmuch as the fundamental rights flouted by a prosecutor’s breach of a plea bargain are those of the defendant, not of the State.” F. 3d, at , n. (quotingSantobello,supra, at ). Three other Justices agreed with [REDACTED] on this point, and because only seven Justices participated in the case, the Ninth Circuit suggested that a four-Justice majority inSanto-belloseemed to favor looking to the defendant’s preferred remedy. F. 3d, at , n. (citingSantobello,supra, at , and n. (Marshall, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part)). The Ninth Circuit also pointed in support to its own Circuit precedent, a criminal procedure treatise, a decision of the Washington Supreme Court, and a law review article. See F. 3d, at –, n. (citingBuckleyv.Terhune, F. 3d , , n. ( ); 5 W. LaFave, J. Israel, N. King, & O. Kerr, Criminal Procedure §.2(e) (4th ed. );Statev.Tourtellotte, Wash. 2d , P. 2d , (); and Fischer, Beyond Santobello—Remedies for Reneged Plea Bargains, 2 U. San Fernando Valley L. Rev. , ()).There are several problems with the Ninth Circuit’s reasoning below. First, “ ‘fairminded jurists could dis-agree’ ” with the Ninth Circuit’s reading ofSantobello.Richter,supra, at (quotingYarboroughv.Alvarado, U. S. , () ). Moreover, inMabryv.Johnson, U. S. () , the Court wrote that “Santobelloexpressly declined to hold that the Constitution compels specific performance of a broken prosecutorial promise as the remedy for such a plea.”Id.,at –, n. (citingSantobello, U. S., at –;id., at – (Marshall, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part)). The Court added that “permitting Santobello to replead was within the range of constitutionally appropriate remedies.” U. S., at , n. . Where, as here, none of our prior decisions clearly entitles Cuero to the relief he seeks, the “state court’s decision could not be ‘contrary to’ any holding from this Court.”Woodsv.Donald, U. S., at 6) (quotingLopezv.Smith, U. S., at 5)). Finally, as we have repeatedly pointed out, “circuit precedent does not constitute ‘clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court.’ ”Glebev.Frost, U. S., at 3) (quoting U. S. C. §(d)(1)). Nor, of course, do state-court decisions, treatises, or law review articles.For all these reasons, we conclude that the Ninth Circuit erred when it held that “federal law” as interpreted by this Court “clearly” establishes that specific performance is constitutionally required here. We decide no other issue in this case.The petition for a writ of certiorari and respondent’s motion to proceedin forma pauperisare granted. We reverse the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered."}

Zane created public Facebook pages to promote their campaigns for election to the Poway Unified School District (PUSD) Board of Trustees. While O’Connor-Ratcliff and Zane (whom we will call the Trustees) both had personal Facebook pages that they shared with friends and family, they used their public pages for campaigning and issues related to PUSD. After they won election, the Trustees continued to use their public pages to post PUSD-related content, including board-meeting recaps, application solicitations for board positions, local budget plans and surveys, and public safety updates. They also used their pages to solicit feedback and communicate with constituents. Their Facebook pages described them as “Government Official[s]” and noted their official positions. O’Connor-Ratcliff also created a public Twitter page, which she used in much the same way.Christopher and Kimberly Garnier, who have children attending PUSD schools, often criticized the board of trustees. They began posting lengthy and repetitive comments on the Trustees’ social-media posts—for instance, nearly identical comments on separate posts on O’Connor-Ratcliff ’s Facebook page and identical replies within a -minute span to every tweet on her Twitter feed. The Trustees initially deleted the Garniers’ comments before blocking them from commenting altogether.The Garniers sued the Trustees under U. S. C. §, seeking damages and declaratory and injunctive relief for the alleged violation of their First Amendment rights. At summary judgment, the District Court granted the Trustees qualified immunity as to the damages claims but allowed the case to proceed on the merits on the ground that the Trustees acted “under color of ” state law when they blocked the Garniers. §.The Ninth Circuit affirmed. It held that §’s state-action requirement was satisfied because there was a “close nexus between the Trustees’ use of their social media pages and their official positions.” F. 4th , ().

S. C. §(d)(1). We have emphasized, time and again, that the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of (AEDPA), 110Stat. , prohibits the federal courts of appeals from rely- ing on their own precedent to conclude that a particular constitutional principle is “clearly established.” See,e.g., Marshallv.Rodgers, U. S. __, __ () (per curiam) (slip op. at 6). Because the Ninth Circuit failed to comply with this rule, we reverse its decision granting habeas relief to respondent Marvin Smith.IRespondent was arrested for the murder of his wife, Minnie Smith. On December , , Mrs. Smith was found dead in the home she shared with respondent, and it was determined that she was killed by a massive blow to the head from a fireplace log roller. The home appeared to have been ransacked, and valuable jewelry was missing.The State charged respondent with first-degree murder and offered substantial incriminating evidence at trial. The prosecution presented evidence that respondent “was unfaithful to his wife for many years, that his wife was threatening to divorce him, and that he told one of his former employees . . . that the ‘only way’ he or his wife would get out of their marriage was ‘to die,’ because he was ‘not going to give [Mrs. Smith] half of what [he] got so some other man can live off of it.’ ” F.3d , – ( ) (second alteration in original).

The missing jewelry was discovered in the trunk of respondent’s car, wrapped in duct tape from the same roll that had provided the pieces found near the body. See F. 3d, at . Respondent’s DNA was found on the duct tape in his trunk. SeeSmith, WL , at *2. In addition, a criminologist testified that the ransacking of the Smiths’ home appeared to have been staged. See F. 3d, at .Respondent defended in part on the basis that he could not have delivered the fatal blow due to rotator cuff surgery several weeks before the murder. Seeibid. (He mounted this defense despite the fact that police had observed him wielding a 6-foot-long 2 by 4 to pry something out of a concrete slab at a construction site the week after the murder. SeeSmith, WL , at *1.) The defense also suggested that one of respondent’s former employees had committed the crime to obtain money to pay a debt he owed respondent. See F. 3d, at .At the close of evidence, the prosecution requested an aiding-and-abetting instruction, and the trial court agreed to give such an instruction. During closing argument, the prosecutor contended that respondent was physically able to wield the log roller that had killed Mrs. Smith, but he also informed the jury that, even if respondent had not delivered the fatal blow, he could still be convicted on an aiding-and-abetting theory. Seeid.,at . The jury convicted respondent of first-degree murder without specifying which theory of guilt it adopted.After a series of state-court proceedings not relevant here, the California Court of Appeal affirmed respondent’s conviction. The state court rejected respondent’s assertion that he had inadequate notice of the possibility of con-viction on an aiding-and-abetting theory. The court ex- plained that “ ‘an accusatory pleading charging a defendant with murder need not specify the theory of murder on which the prosecution intends to rely,’ ” and noted that the “information charged defendant with murder in compliance with the governing statutes.”Smith, WL , at *6–*7. Furthermore, the court held that “even if this case required greater specificity concerning the basis of defendant’s liability, the evidence presented at his preliminary examination provided it.”Id., at *7. The upshot was that “the information and preliminary examination testimony adequately notified defendant he could be prosecuted for murder as an aider and abettor.”Id.,at *8. The California Supreme Court denied respondent’s petition for review.Respondent filed a petition for habeas relief with the United States District Court for the Central District of California. The Magistrate Judge recommended granting relief, and the District Court summarily adopted the Magistrate Judge’s recommendation.The Ninth Circuit affirmed. The court acknowledged that the “information charging [respondent] with first-degree murder was initially sufficient to put him on notice that he could be convicted either as a principal or as an aider-and-abettor,” because under California law “aiding and abetting a crime is the same substantive offense as perpetrating the crime.” F. 3d, at . But the Ninth Circuit nevertheless concluded that respondent’s Sixth Amendment and due process right to notice had been violated because it believed the prosecution (until it requested the aiding-and-abetting jury instruction) had tried the case only on the theory that respondent himself had delivered the fatal blow. Seeid.,at .The Ninth Circuit did not purport to identify any case in which we have found notice constitutionally inadequate because, although the defendant was initially adequately apprised of the offense against him, the prosecutor focused at trial on one potential theory of liability at the expense of another. Rather, it found the instant case to be “indistinguishable from” the Ninth Circuit’s own decision inSheppardv.Rees, F.2d (), which the court thought “faithfully applied the principles enunciated by the Supreme Court.” F. 3d, at . The court also rejected, as an “unreasonable determination of the facts,” U. S. C. §(d)(2), the California Court of Appeal’s conclusion that preliminary examination testimony and the jury instructions conference put respondent on notice of the possibility of conviction on an aiding-and-abetting theory. Seeid.,at –.IIAThe Ninth Circuit held, and respondent does not dispute, that respondent initially received adequate notice of the possibility of conviction on an aiding-and-abetting theory. The question is therefore whether habeas relief is warranted because the State principally relied at trial on the theory that respondent himself delivered the fatal blow.Assuming,arguendo,that a defendant is entitled to notice of the possibility of conviction on an aiding-and-abetting theory, the Ninth Circuit’s grant of habeas relief may be affirmed only if this Court’s cases clearly establish that a defendant, once adequately apprised of such a possibility, can nevertheless be deprived of adequate notice by a prosecutorial decision to focus on another theory of liability at trial. The Ninth Circuit pointed to no case of ours holding as much. Instead, the Court of Appeals cited three older cases that stand for nothing more than the general proposition that a defendant must have adequate notice of the charges against him. See F. 3d, at – (citingRussellv.United States, U.S. , – ();In re Oliver, U.S. , – ();Colev.Arkansas, U.S. , ()).This proposition is far too abstract to establish clearly the specific rule respondent needs. We have before cautioned the lower courts—and the Ninth Circuit in particular—against “framing our precedents at such a high level of generality.”Nevadav.[REDACTED], U. S., at 7). None of our decisions that the Ninth Circuit cited addresses, even remotely, the specific question presented by this case. SeeRussell,supra, at (indictment for “refus[ing] to answer any question pertinent to [a] question under [congressional] inquiry,” 2 U. S. C. §, failed to “identify the subject under congressional subcommittee inquiry”);In re Oliver,supra, at (instantaneous indictment, conviction, and sentence by judge acting as grand jury with no prior notice of charge to defendant);Cole,supra, at (affirmance of criminal convictions “under a . . . statute for violation of which [defendants] had not been charged”).[1]Because our case law does not clearly establish the legal proposition needed to grant respondent habeas relief, the Ninth Circuit was forced to rely heavily on its own decision inSheppard,supra. Of course, AEDPA permits habeas relief only if a state court’s decision is “contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law” as determined by this Court, not by the courts of appeals. U. S. C. §(d)(1). The Ninth Circuit attempted to evade this barrier by holding thatSheppard“faithfully applied the principles enunciated by the Supreme Court inCole,Oliver, andRussell.” F. 3d, at . But Circuit precedent cannot “refine or sharpen a general principle of Supreme Court jurisprudence into a specific legal rule that this Court has not announced.”Marshall, U. S., at __ (slip op., at 6).Sheppardis irrelevant to the question presented by this case: whether our case law clearly establishes that a prosecutor’s focus on one theory of liability at trial can render earlier notice of another theory of liability inadequate.BThe Ninth Circuit also disagreed with what it termed the state court’s “determination of the facts”—principally, the state court’s holding that preliminary examination testimony and the prosecutors’ request for an aiding-and-abetting jury instruction shortly before closing arguments adequately put respondent on notice of the prosecution’s aiding-and-abetting theory. F. 3d, at (internal quotation marks omitted). The Ninth Circuit therefore granted relief under §(d)(2), which permits habeas relief where the state-court “decision . . . was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.” That holding cannot be sustained.In purporting to reject the state court’s “determination of the facts,” the Ninth Circuit focused on preliminary examination testimony by an investigator about conversations between respondent and his cellmate. According to the investigator, the cellmate stated that respondent told him that respondent “had to get rid of his wife because she was standing in the way of his future plans; that she was threatening to divorce him and he wasn’t going to give up half of his property”; that respondent made his house look like the site of a home invasion robbery; and that, when he left for work the morning of the murder, he left the window open and did not set the alarm.Smith, WL , at *7. The investigator also testified that the cellmate did not “ ‘know any of the details of the homicide itself and how it was carried out,’ ” and that respondent “ ‘never told [the cellmate] specifically who’ ” committed the homicide.Ibid.The California Court of Appeal held that these statements, taken together, suggested that respondent was involved in planning and facilitating the crime but that the fatal blow might have been delivered by an accomplice.Ibid.Thus, the California court believed that even assuming that the information by itself was not sufficient, this testimony naturally lent itself to conviction on an aiding-and-abetting theory and so gave respondent even greater notice of such a possibility.Ibid.The Ninth Circuit also focused on the jury instructions conference, which occurred after the defense rested but before the parties’ closing arguments. During that conference, prosecutors requested an aiding-and-abetting instruction, which further provided notice to respondent. The California Court of Appeal concluded that this case is distinguishable fromSheppardv.Rees, F.2d , because, unlike that case, the conference here did not occur immediately before closing arguments. The Ninth Circuit disagreed, holding that because “defense counsel had only the lunch recess to formulate a response” to the aiding-and-abetting instruction, this case “is indistinguishable fromSheppard,” where the prosecution also “requested the new instruction the same day as closing.” F. 3d, at , .Although the Ninth Circuit claimed its disagreement with the state court was factual in nature, in reality its grant of relief was based on a legal conclusion about the adequacy of the notice provided. The Ninth Circuit believed that the events detailed above, even when taken together with the information filed against respondent, failed to measure up to the standard of notice applicable in cases like this. That ranked as a legal determination governed by §(d)(1), not one of fact governed by §(d)(2). But, as we have explained, the Ninth Circuit cited only its own precedent for establishing the appropriate standard. Absent a decision of ours clearly establishing the relevant standard, the Ninth Circuit had nothing against which it could assess, and deem lacking, the notice afforded respondent by the information and proceedings. It therefore had no basis to reject the state court’s assessment that respondent was adequately apprised of the pos- sibility of conviction on an aiding-and-abetting theory.[2]The petition for a writ of certiorari is granted. The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.Notes1Respondent claims that our decision inLankfordv.Idaho, U.S. (), although not cited by the Ninth Circuit, clearly establishes the legal principle he needs. ButLankfordis of no help to respondent. That case addressed whether a defendant had adequate notice of the possibility of imposition of the death penalty—a far different question from whether respondent had adequate notice of the particular theory of liability. Seeid.,at . InLankford, moreover, the trial court itself made specific statements that encouraged the defendant to believe that the death penalty was off the table. Seeid.,at –.2Because we reverse the Ninth Circuit’s decision on the foregoing grounds, we need not opine on the correctness of that court’s discussion ofGriffinv.United States, U.S. (), orBrechtv.Abrahamson, U.S. ()."}

Decided April , 2021Per Curiam.In , an Alaska jury convicted Sean Wright of counts of sexual abuse of a minor. SeeStatev.Wright, P.3d , (Alaska ). Wright finished serving his sentence in Alaska in , and shortly thereafter he moved to Tennessee. Once there, he failed to register as a sex offender as required by federal law. See Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act, 120Stat. , , U. S. C. §§, . Wright pleaded guilty to one count of failure to register, see U. S. C. §(a), and ultimately received a sentence of time served along with five years of supervised release. See Judgment inUnited Statesv.Wright, No. 1:–cr–, ECF Doc. No. (ED Tenn.).During the course of those federal proceedings, Wright filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the District of Alaska pursuant to U. S. C. §§ and . He argued that the Alaska Supreme Court had unreasonably applied clearly established federal law when it denied his Sixth Amendment claims and affirmed his state conviction and sentence. The District Court denied the motion on the threshold ground that Wright was not “in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court.” §(a). Noting that a proper motion under §(a) requires more than merely being “in custody”somewhere, the court reasoned that “the proper procedure for Wright to challenge his current federal custody would be a motion filed in the Eastern District of Tennessee pursuant to U. S. C. §.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 16a.The Court of Appeals reversed. In its view, Wright’s state conviction was “ ‘a necessary predicate’ ” to his federal conviction, Fed. Appx. , ( ) (quotingZichkov.Idaho, F.3d , ( )), so Wright was in fact in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court. The panel declined to assess the District Court’s view that §, rather than §, provided the proper route for Wright to challenge his current custody. Fed. Appx., at , n. 1. One judge concurred and asserted that § was the proper mechanism “because Wright is not attacking the constitutionality of his federal conviction for failing to register as a sex offender in Tennessee; he is collaterally attacking the constitutionality of his predicate Alaska conviction for sexual abuse of a minor.”Id.,at .The Court of Appeals clearly erred. Section (a) permits a federal court to entertain an application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person “in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court.” InMalengv.Cook, U.S. () (per curiam), we held that a habeas petitioner does not remain “in custody” under a conviction “after the sentence imposed for it has fully expired, merely because of the possibility that the prior conviction will be used to enhance the sentences imposed for any subsequent crimes of which he is convicted.”Id.,at ; see alsoid.,at (noting the “in custody” requirement appears in both §§(c)(3) and (a)). It made no difference, we said, that the possibility of a prior-conviction enhancement had materialized for the habeas petitioner in that case: “When the second sentence is imposed, it is pursuant to the second conviction that the petitioner is incarcerated and is therefore ‘in custody.’ ”Id.,at –.That Wright’s state conviction served as a predicate for his federal conviction thus did not render him “in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court” under §(a). If Wright’s second conviction had been for a state crime, he independently could have satisfied §(a)’s “in custody” requirement, seeLackawanna County District Attorneyv.Coss, U.S. , – (), though his ability to attack the first conviction by that means would have been limited, seeid.,at –. Wright could not satisfy §(a) on that independent basis for the simple reason that his second judgment was entered by a federal court.* * *We express no view on the other theories Wright advanced before the District Court for meeting the requirements of §(a). We grant the petition for a writ of certiorari, vacate the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, and remand the case to that court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered."}
{"file_name": "per curiam_2014_13_574.json", "author": "per curiam", "year": 2014, "text": "–. Decided November , 2014Per Curiam.On July 3, , the Pennsylvania State Police Department received a report that a man named Michael Zita had stolen a car and two loaded handguns. The report also said that Zita might have fled to the home of Andrew and Karen Carman. The department sent Officers Jeremy Carroll and Brian [REDACTED] to the Carmans’ home to investigate. Neither officer had been to the home before. F.3d , ( ).The officers arrived in separate patrol cars around 2: p.m. The Carmans’ house sat on a corner lot—the front of the house faced a main street while the left (as viewed from the front) faced a side street. The officers initially drove to the front of the house, but after discovering that parking was not available there, turned right onto the side street. As they did so, they saw several cars parked side-by-side in a gravel parking area on the left side of the Carmans’ property. The officers parked in the “first available spot,” at “the far rear of the property.”Ibid.(quoting Tr. (Apr. 8, )).The officers exited their patrol cars. As they looked toward the house, the officers saw a small structure (either a carport or a shed) with its door open and a light on.Id.,at . Thinking someone might be inside, Officer Carroll walked over, “poked [his] head” in, and said “Pennsylvania State Police.” F. 3d, at (quoting Tr. (Apr. 8, ); alteration in original). No one was there, however, so the officers continued walking toward the house. As they approached, they saw a sliding glass door that opened onto a ground-level deck. Carroll thought the sliding glass door “looked like a customary entryway,” so he and Officer [REDACTED] decided to knock on it. F. 3d, at (quoting Tr. (Apr. 8, )).As the officers stepped onto the deck, a man came out of the house and “belligerent[ly] and aggressively approached” them. F. 3d, at . The officers identified themselves, explained they were looking for Michael Zita, and asked the man for his name. The man refused to answer. Instead, he turned away from the officers and appeared to reach for his waist.Id.,at –. Carroll grabbed the man’s right arm to make sure he was not reaching for a weapon. The man twisted away from Carroll, lost his balance, and fell into the yard.Id.,at .At that point, a woman came out of the house and asked what was happening. The officers again explained that they were looking for Zita. The woman then identified herself as Karen Carman, identified the man as her husband, Andrew Carman, and told the officers that Zita was not there. In response, the officers asked for permission to search the house for Zita. Karen Carman consented, and everyone went inside.Ibid.The officers searched the house, but did not find Zita. They then left. The Carmans were not charged with any crimes.Ibid.The Carmans later sued Officer Carroll in Federal District Court under U. S. C. §. Among other things, they alleged that Carroll unlawfully entered their property in violation of the Fourth Amendment when he went into their backyard and onto their deck without a warrant. F. 3d, at .At trial, Carroll argued that his entry was lawful under the “knock and talk” exception to the warrant requirement. That exception, he contended, allows officers to knock on someone’s door, so long as they stay “on those portions of [the] property that the general public is allowed to go on.” Tr. 7 (Apr. 8, ). The Carmans responded that a normal visitor would have gone to their front door, rather than into their backyard or onto their deck. Thus, they argued, the “knock and talk” exception did not apply.At the close of Carroll’s case in chief, the parties each moved for judgment as a matter of law. The District Court denied both motions, and sent the case to a jury. As relevant here, the District Court instructed the jury that the “knock and talk” exception “allows officers without a warrant to knock on a resident’s door or otherwise approach the residence seeking to speak to the inhabitants, just as any private citizen might.”Id., at (Apr. , ). The District Court further explained that “officers should restrict their movements to walkways, driveways, porches and places where visitors could be expected to go.”Ibid.The jury then returned a verdict for Carroll.The Carmans appealed, and the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed in relevant part. The court held that Officer Carroll violated the Fourth Amendment as a matter of law because the “knock and talk” exception “requires that police officers begin their encounter at the front door, where they have an implied invitation to go.” F. 3d, at . The court also held that Carroll was not entitled to qualified immunity because his actions violated clearly established law.Ibid.The court therefore reversed the District Court and held that the Carmans were entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Carroll petitioned for certiorari. We grant the petition and reverse the Third Circuit’s determination that Carroll was not entitled to qualified immunity.A government official sued under § is entitled to qualified immunity unless the official violated a statutory or constitutional right that was clearly established at the time of the challenged conduct. SeeAshcroftv.al-Kidd, U. S., at 3). A right is clearly established only if its contours are sufficiently clear that “a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right.”Andersonv.Creighton, U.S. , (). In other words, “existing precedent must have placed the statutory or constitutional question beyond debate.”al-Kidd, U. S., at 9). This doctrine “gives government officials breathing room to make reasonable but mistaken judgments,” and “protects ‘all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.’ ”Id., at ) (quotingMalleyv.Briggs, U.S. , ()).Here the Third Circuit cited only a single case to support its decision that Carroll was not entitled to qualified immunity—Estate of Smithv.Marasco, F.3d ( ). Assuming for the sake of argument that a controlling circuit precedent could constitute clearly established federal law in these circumstances, seeReichlev.Howards, U. S., at 7),Marascodoes not clearly establish that Carroll violated the Carmans’ Fourth Amendment rights.InMarasco, two police officers went to Robert Smith’s house and knocked on the front door. When Smith did not respond, the officers went into the backyard, and at least one entered the garage. F. 3d, at . The court acknowledged that the officers’ “entry into the curtilage after not receiving an answer at the front door might be reasonable.”Id.,at . It held, however, that the District Court had not made the factual findings needed to decide that issue.Id.,at . For example, the Third Circuit noted that the record “did not discuss the layout of the property or the position of the officers on that prop- erty,” and that “there [was] no indication of whether the officers followed a path or other apparently open route that would be suggestive of reasonableness.”Ibid.The court therefore remanded the case for further proceedings.In concluding that Officer Carroll violated clearly established law in this case, the Third Circuit relied exclusively onMarasco’s statement that “entry into the curtilage after not receiving an answer at the front door might be reasonable.”Id.,at ; see F. 3d, at (quotingMarasco,supra,at ). In the court’s view, that statement clearly established that a “knock and talk” must begin at the front door. But that conclusion does not follow.Marascoheld that an unsuccessful “knock and talk” at the front door does not automatically allow officers to go onto other parts of the property. It did not hold, however, that knocking on the front door isrequiredbefore officers go onto other parts of the property that are open to visitors. Thus,Marascosimply did not answer the question whether a “knock and talk” must begin at the front door when visitors may also go to the back door. Indeed, the house at issue seems not to have even had a back door, let alone one that visitors could use. F. 3d, at .Moreover,Marascoexpressly stated that “there [was] no indication of whether the officers followed a path or other apparently open route that would be suggestive of reasonableness.”Ibid.That makesMarascowholly different from this case, where the jury necessarily decided that Carroll “restrict[ed] [his] movements to walkways, driveways, porches and places where visitors could be expected to go.” Tr. (Apr. , ).To the extent thatMarascosays anything about this case, it arguably supports Carroll’s view. InMarasco, the Third Circuit noted that “[o]fficers are allowed to knock on a residence’s door or otherwise approach the residence seeking to speak to the inhabitants just as any private citizen may.” F. 3d, at . The court also said that, “ ‘when the police come on to private property . . . and restrict their movements to places visitors could be expected to go (e.g., walkways, driveways, porches), observations made from such vantage points are not covered by the Fourth Amendment.’ ”Ibid.(quoting 1 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure §2.3(f ) (3d ed. and Supp. ) (footnotes omitted)). Had Carroll read those statements before going to the Carmans’ house, he may have concluded—quite reasonably—that he was allowed to knock on any door that was open to visitors.[1]*The Third Circuit’s decision is even more perplexing in comparison to the decisions of other federal and state courts, which have rejected the rule the Third Circuit adopted here. For example, inUnited Statesv.Titemore, F.3d ( ), a police officer approached a house that had two doors. The first was a traditional door that opened onto a driveway; the second was a sliding glass door that opened onto a small porch. The officer chose to knock on the latter.Id., at –. On appeal, the defendant argued that the officer had unlawfully entered his property without a warrant in violation of the Fourth Amendment.Id.,at –. But the Second Circuit rejected that argument. As the court explained, the sliding glass door was “a primary entrance visible to and used by the public.”Id.,at . Thus, “[b]ecause [the officer] approached a principal entrance to the home using a route that other visitors could be expected to take,” the court held that he did not violate the Fourth Amendment.Id.,at .The Seventh Circuit’s decision inUnited Statesv.James, F.3d (), vacated on other grounds, U.S. (), provides another example. There, police officers approached a duplex with multiple entrances. Bypassing the front door, the officers “used a paved walkway along the side of the duplex leading to the rear side door.” F. 3d, at . On appeal, the defendant argued that the officers violated his Fourth Amendment rights when they went to the rear side door. The Seventh Circuit rejected that argument, explaining that the rear side door was “accessible to the general public” and “was commonly used for entering the duplex from the nearby alley.”Ibid.In situations “where the back door of a residence is readily accessible to the general public,” the court held, “the Fourth Amendment is not implicated when police officers approach that door in the reasonable belief that it is a principal means of access to the dwelling.”Ibid.See also,e.g., United Statesv.Garcia, F.2d , – ( ) (“If the front and back of a residence are read- ily accessible from a public place, like the driveway and parking area here, the Fourth Amendment is not implicated when officers go to the back door reasonably believing it is used as a principal entrance to the dwelling”);Statev.Domicz, N. J. , , A.2d , () (“when a law enforcement officer walks to a front or back door for the purpose of making contact with a resident and reasonably believes that the door is used by visitors, he is not unconstitutionally trespassing on to the property”).We do not decide today whether those cases were correctly decided or whether a police officer may conduct a “knock and talk” at any entrance that is open to visitors rather than only the front door. “But whether or not the constitutional rule applied by the court below was correct, it was not ‘beyond debate.’ ”Stantonv.Sims, U. S., at 8) (quotingal-Kidd, U. S., at 9)). The Third Circuit therefore erred when it held that Carroll was not entitled to qualified immunity.The petition for certiorari is granted. The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.* In a footnote, the Court of Appeals “recognize[d] that there may be some instances in which the front door is nottheentrance used by visitors,” but noted that “this is not one such instance.” F.3d , , n. 6 () (emphasis added). This footnote still reflects the Third Circuit’s view that the “knock and talk” exception is available for only one entrance to a dwelling, “which in most circumstances is the front door.”Id.,at . Cf.United Statesv.Perea-Rey, F.3d , ( ) (“Officers conducting a knock and talk . . . need not approach only a specific door if there are multiple doors accessible to the public.”)."}

Decided February , 2019Per Curiam.In , the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals held that petitioner, Bobby James Moore, didnothave intellectual disability and consequently was eligible for the death penalty.Ex parte Moore, S.W.3d , – (Ex parte Moore I). We previously considered the lawfulness of that determination, vacated the appeals court’s decision, and remanded the case for further consideration of the issue.Moorev.Texas, U. S., at ). The appeals court subsequently reconsidered the matter but reached the same conclusion.Ex parte Moore, S.W.3d , (Tex. Crim. App. ) (Ex parte Moore II). We again review its decision, and we reverse its determination.IWhen we first heard this case, inMoore, we noted that the state trial court (a state habeas court) “received affidavits and heard testimony from Moore’s family members, former counsel, and a number of court-appointed mental-health experts.” U. S., at 3). We described the evidence as “reveal[ing]” the following:“Moore had significant mental and social difficulties beginning at an early age. At , Moore lacked basic understanding of the days of the week, the months of the year, and the seasons; he could scarcely tell time or comprehend the standards of measure or the basic principle that subtraction is the reverse of addition. At school, because of his limited ability to read and write, Moore could not keep up with lessons. Often, he was separated from the rest of the class and told to draw pictures. Moore’s father, teachers, and peers called him ‘stupid’ for his slow reading and speech. After failing every subject in the ninth grade, Moore dropped out of high school. Cast out of his home, he survived on the streets, eating from trash cans, even after two bouts of food poisoning.”Ibid. (citations omitted).On the basis of this and other evidence, the trial court found that Moore had intellectual disability and thus was ineligible for the death penalty underAtkinsv.Virginia, U.S. (). App. to Pet. for Cert. 310a–311a. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals reversed that determination,Ex parte Moore I, S.W.3d , and we reviewed its decision,Moore, U. S.At the outset of our opinion, we recognized as valid the three underlying legal criteria that both the trial court and appeals court had applied.Id., at 3–4) (citing American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities, Intellectual Disability: Definition, Classification, and Systems of Supports (11th ed. ) (AAIDD–); American Psychiatric Association, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed. ) (DSM–5)). To make a finding of intellectual disability, a court must see: (1) deficits in intellectual functioning—primarily a test-related criterion, see DSM–5, at ; (2) adaptive deficits, “assessed using both clinical evaluation and individualized . . . measures,”ibid.; and (3) the onset of these deficits while the defendant was still a minor,id., at . With respect to the first criterion, we wrote that Moore’s intellectual testing indicated his was a borderline case, but that he had demonstrated sufficient intellectual-functioning deficits to require consideration of the second criterion—adaptive functioning.Moore, U. S., at –). With respect to the third criterion, we found general agreement that any onset took place when Moore was a minor.Id. 3 (slip op., at 4, n. 3).But there was significant disagreement between the state courts about whether Moore had the adaptive deficits needed for intellectual disability. “In determining the significance of adaptive deficits, clinicians look to whether an individual’s adaptive performance falls two or more standard deviations below the mean in any of the three adaptive skill sets (conceptual, social, and practical).”Id., at 4) (citing AAIDD–, at ). Based on the evidence before it, the trial court found that “Moore’s performance fell roughly two standard deviations below the mean inall threeskill categories.” U. S., at 4); see App. to Pet. for Cert. 309a. Reversing that decision, the appeals court held that Moore had “not proven by a preponderance of the evidence” that he possessed the requisite adaptive deficits, and thus was eligible for the death penalty.Ex parte Moore I, S. W. 3d, at . We disagreed with the appeals court’s adaptive-functioning analysis, however, and identified at least five errors.First, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals “overemphasized Moore’s perceived adaptive strengths.”Moore, U. S., at ). “But the medical community,” we said, “focuses the adaptive-functioning inquiry on adaptivedeficits.”Ibid.Second, the appeals court “stressed Moore’s improved behavior in prison.”Id., at ). But “[c]linicians . . . caution against reliance on adaptive strengths developed ‘in a controlled setting,’ as a prison surely is.”Ibid. (quoting DSM–5, at ).Third, the appeals court “concluded that Moore’s record of academic failure, . . . childhood abuse[,] and suffering . . . detracted from a determination that his intellectual and adaptive deficits were related.” U. S., at ). But “in the medical community,” those “traumatic experiences” are considered “ ‘risk factors’forintellectual disability.”Ibid. (quoting AAIDD–, at –).Fourth, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals required “Moore to show that his adaptive deficits were not related to ‘a personality disorder.’ ” U. S., at ) (quotingEx parte Moore I, S. W. 3d, at ). But clinicians recognize that the “existence of a personality disorder or mental-health issue . . . is ‘not evidence that a person does not also have intellectual disability.’ ” U. S., at ) (quoting Brief for American Psychological Association et al. asAmici CuriaeinMoorev.Texas, O. T. , No. –, p. ).Fifth, the appeals court directed state courts, when examining adaptive deficits, to rely upon certain factors set forth in a Texas case calledEx parte Briseno, S.W.3d 1(Tex. Crim. App. ).Ex parte Moore I, S. W. 3d, at , . TheBrisenofactors were: whether “those who knew the person best during the developmental stage” thought of him as “mentally retarded”; whether he could “formulat[e] plans” and “car[ry] them through”; whether his conduct showed “leadership”; whether he showed a “rational and appropriate” “response to external stimuli”; whether he could answer questions “coherently” and “rationally”; whether he could “hide facts or lie effectively”; and whether the commission of his offense required “forethought, planning, and complex execution of purpose.” S. W. 3d, at 8–9.We criticized the use of these factors both because they had no grounding in prevailing medical practice, and because they invited “lay perceptions of intellectual dis-ability” and “lay stereotypes” to guide assessment of intellectual disability.Moore, U. S., at ). Emphasizing theBrisenofactors over clinical factors, we said, “ ‘creat[es] an unacceptable risk that persons with intellectual disability will be executed.’ ” U. S., at ) (quotingHallv.Florida, U.S. , ()). While our decisions in “AtkinsandHallleft to the States ‘the task of developing appropriate ways to enforce’ the restriction on executing the intellectually disabled,” U. S., at 9) (quotingHall, U. S., at ), a court’s intellectual disability determination “must be ‘informed by the medical community’s diagnostic framework,’ ” U. S., at 9) (quotingHall, U. S., at ).Three Members of this Court dissented from the major-ity’s treatment of Moore’s intellectual functioning and with aspects of its adaptive-functioning analysis, but all agreed about the impropriety of theBrisenofactors. As The Chief Justice wrote in his dissenting opinion, theBrisenofactors were “an unacceptable method of enforcing the guarantee ofAtkins”and the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals “therefore erred in using them to analyze adaptive deficits.”Moore, U. S. J.) (slip op., at 1).For the reasons we have described, the Court set aside the judgment of the appeals court and remanded the case “for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.”Id., at ).IIOn remand the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals reconsidered the appeal and reached the same basic conclusion, namely, that Moore had not demonstrated intellectual disability.Ex parte Moore II, S. W. 3d, at . The court again noted the three basic criteria: intellectual-functioning deficits, adaptive deficits, and early onset.Id., at –. But this time it focused almost exclusively on the second criterion, adaptive deficits. The court said that, in doing so, it would “abandon reliance on theBrisenoevidentiary factors.”Id., at . It would instead use “ ‘current medical diagnostic standards’ ” set forth in the American Psychiatric Association’s DSM–5.Id., at –. In applying those standards to the trial court record, it found the State’s expert witness, Dr. Kristi Compton, “ ‘far more credible and reliable’ ” than the other experts considered by the trial court.Id., at . (As in our last opinion, we neither second nor second-guess that judgment.) And, as we have said, it reached the same conclusion it had before.Moore has now filed a petition for certiorari in which he argues that the trial court record demonstrates his intellectual disability. He asks us to reverse the appeals court’s contrary holding. Pet. for Cert. 2. The prosecutor, the district attorney of Harris County, “agrees with the petitioner that he is intellectually disabled and cannot be executed.” Brief in Opposition 9. The American Psychological Association (APA), American Bar Association (ABA), and various individuals have also filedamicus curiaebriefs supporting the position of Moore and the prosecutor. Brief for APA et al. asAmici Curiae; Brief for ABA asAmicus Curiae; Brief for Donald B. Ayer et al. asAmici Curiae. The Attorney General of Texas, however, has filed a motion for leave to intervene, and asks us to deny Moore’s petition. Motion for Leave to Intervene as a Respondent.IIIAfter reviewing the trial court record and the court of appeals’ opinion, we agree with Moore that the appeals court’s determination is inconsistent with our opinion inMoore. We have found in its opinion too many instances in which, with small variations, it repeats the analysis we previously found wanting, and these same parts are critical to its ultimate conclusion.For one thing, the court of appeals again relied less upon the adaptivedeficitsto which the trial court had referred than upon Moore’s apparent adaptivestrengths. SeeMoore, U. S., at ) (criticizing the appeals court’s “overemphas[is]” upon Moore’s “perceived adaptive strengths”);supra, at 3. The appeals court’s discussion of Moore’s “[c]ommunication [s]kills” does not discuss the evidence relied upon by the trial court.Ex parte Moore II, S. W. 3d, at –. That evidence includes the young Moore’s inability to understand and answer family members, even a failure on occasion to respond to his own name. App. to Pet. for Cert. 289a–290a. Its review of Moore’s “[r]eading and [w]riting” refers to deficits only in observing that “in prison, [Moore] progressed from being illiterate to being able to write at a seventh-grade level.”Ex parte Moore II, S. W. 3d, at . But the trial court heard, among other things, evidence that in school Moore was made to draw pictures when other children were reading, and that by sixth grade Moore struggled to read at a second-grade level. App. to Pet. for Cert. 290a, 295a.Instead, the appeals court emphasized Moore’s capacity to communicate, read, and write based in part onpro sepapers Moore filed in court.Ex parte Moore II, S. W. 3d, at –. That evidence is relevant, but it lacks convincing strength without a determination about whether Moore wrote the papers on his own, a finding that the court of appeals declined to make. Rather, the court dismissed the possibility of outside help: Even if other inmates “composed” these papers, it said, Moore’s “ability to copy such documents by hand” was “within the realm of only a few intellectually disabled people.”Id., at . Similarly, the court of appeals stressed Moore’s “coherent” testimony in various proceedings, but acknowledged that Moore had “a lawyer to coach him” in all but one.Id., at , and n. . As for thatpro sehearing, the court observed that Moore read letters into the record “without any apparent difficulty.”Ibid.For another thing, the court of appeals relied heavily upon adaptive improvements made in prison. SeeMoore, U. S., at ) (“caution[ing] against reliance on adaptive strengths developed” in “prison”);supra, at 3. It concluded that Moore has command of elementary math, but its examples concern trips to the prison commissary, commissary purchases, and the like.Ex parte Moore II, S. W. 3d, at –. It determined that Moore had shown leadership ability in prison by refusing, on occasion, “to mop up some spilled oat- meal,” shave, get a haircut, or sit down.Id., at –, and n. . And as we have said, it stressed correspondence written in prison.Id., at . The length and detail of the court’s discussion on these points is difficult to square with our caution against relying on prison-based development.Further, the court of appeals concluded that Moore failed to show that the “cause of [his] deficient social behavior was related to any deficits in general mental abilities” rather than “emotional problems.”Id., at . But in our last review, we said that the court of appeals had “departed from clinical practice” when it required Moore to prove that his “problems in kindergarten” stemmed from his intellectual disability, rather than “ ‘emotional problems.’ ”Moore, U. S., at ) (quotingEx parte Moore I, S. W. 3d, at , )). And we pointed to anamicusbrief in which the APA explained that a personality disorder or mental-health issue is “not evidence that a person does not also have intellectual disability.” U. S., at ) (quoting Brief for APA et al. asAmici Curiaein No. –, at ).Finally, despite the court of appeals’ statement that it would “abandon reliance on theBrisenoevidentiary factors,”Ex parte MooreII, S. W. 3d, at , it seems to have used many of those factors in reaching its conclusion. Seesupra, at 4 (detailing those factors). Thus,Brisenoasked whether the “offense require[d] forethought, planning, and complex execution of purpose.” S. W. 3d, at 9. The court of appeals wrote that Moore’s crime required “a level of planning and forethought.”Ex parte Moore II, S. W. 3d, at , (observing that Moore “w[ore] a wig, conceal[ed] the weapon, and fle[d]” after the crime).Brisenoasked whether the defendant could “respond coherently, rationally, and on point to oral and written questions.” S. W. 3d, at 8. The court of appeals found that Moore “responded rationally and coherently to questions.”Ex parte Moore II, S. W. 3d, at .AndBrisenoasked whether the defendant’s “conduct show[s] leadership or . . . that he is led around by others.” S. W. 3d, at 8. The court of appeals wrote that Moore’s “refus[al] to mop up some spilled oatmeal” (and other such behavior) showed that he “influences others and stands up to authority.”Ex parte Moore II, S. W. 3d, at –.Of course, clinicians also ask questions to which the court of appeals’ statements might be relevant. See AAIDD–, at (noting that how a person “follows rules” and “obeys laws” can bear on assessment of her social skills). But the similarity of language and content betweenBriseno’s factors and the court of appeals’ statements suggests thatBrisenocontinues to “pervasively infec[t] the [the appeals courts’] analysis.”Moore, U. S., at ).To be sure, the court of appeals opinion is not identical to the opinion we considered inMoore. There are sentences here and there suggesting other modes of analysis consistent with what we said. But there are also sentences here and there suggesting reliance upon what we earlier called “lay stereotypes of the intellectually disabled.”Id., at ). CompareEx parte Moore II, S. W. 3d, at – (finding evidence that Moore “had a girlfriend” and a job as tending to show he lacks intellectual disability), with AAIDD–, at (criticizing the “incorrect stereotypes” that persons with intellectual disability “never have friends, jobs, spouses, or children”), and Brief for APA et al. asAmici (“[I]t is estimated that between nine and forty percent of persons with in-tellectual disability have some form of paid employment”).We conclude that the appeals court’s opinion, when taken as a whole and when read in the light both of our prior opinion and the trial court record, rests upon analysis too much of which too closely resembles what we previously found improper. And extricating that analysis from the opinion leaves too little that might warrant reaching a different conclusion than did the trial court. We consequently agree with Moore and the prosecutor that, on the basis of the trial court record, Moore has shown he is a person with intellectual disability.* * *The petition for certiorari is granted. The Attorney General of Texas’ motion to intervene is denied; we have considered that filing as anamicusbrief. The judgment of the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.It is so ordered."}

Decided November 9, 2009Per Curiam.The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit granted habeas relief to Robert Van Hook on the ground that he did not receive effective assistance of counsel during the sentencing phase of his capital trial. Because we think it clear that Van Hook’s attorneys met the constitutional minimum of competence under the correct standard, we grant the petition and reverse.IOn February , , Van Hook went to a Cincinnati bar that catered to homosexual men, hoping to find someone to rob. He approached David Self, and after the two spent several hours drinking together they left for Self’s apartment. There Van Hook “lured Self into a vulnerable position” and attacked him, first strangling him until he was unconscious, then killing him with a kitchen knife and mutilating his body.Statev.Van Hook, Ohio St. 3d , –, N. E. 2d , (). Before fleeing with Self’s valuables, Van Hook attempted to cover his tracks, stuffing the knife and other items into the body and smearing fingerprints he had left behind. Six weeks later, police found him in Florida, where he confessed.Van Hook was indicted in Ohio for aggravated murder, with one capital specification, and aggravated robbery. He waived his right to a jury trial, and a three-judge panel found him guilty of both charges and the capital specification. At the sentencing hearing, the defense called eight mitigation witnesses, and Van Hook himself gave an unsworn statement. After weighing the aggravating and mitigating circumstances, the trial court imposed the death penalty. The Ohio courts affirmed on direct appeal,id., at , N. E. 2d, at ;Statev.Van Hook, No. C––, WL (Ohio App., May , )(per curiam), and we denied certiorari,Van Hookv.Ohio, U. S. (). Van Hook also sought state postconviction relief, which the Ohio courts denied.Statev.Van Hook, No. C–, WL (Ohio App., Oct. , )(per curiam), appeal denied, Ohio St. 3d , N. E. 2d , rehearing denied, Ohio St. 3d , N. E. 2d ();Statev.Van Hook, Ohio St. 3d , N. E. 2d ().Van Hook filed this federal habeas petition in . The District Court denied relief on all of his claims.Van Hookv.Anderson, No. C–1–– (SD Ohio, Aug. 7, ), App. to Pet. for Cert. 123a, 163a. A panel of the Sixth Circuit reversed, concluding that Van Hook’s confession was unconstitutionally obtained underEdwardsv.Arizona, U. S. (). SeeVan Hookv.Anderson, F. 3d , (). The en banc Sixth Circuit vacated that ruling, holding the confession was proper, and it remanded the case to the panel to consider Van Hook’s other claims. SeeVan Hookv.Anderson, F. 3d , (). Van Hook petitioned for a writ of certiorari, which we denied.Van Hookv.Hudson, U. S. ().On remand, the panel granted Van Hook habeas relief again, but on different grounds, holding that his attorneys were ineffective during the penalty phase because they did not adequately investigate and present mitigating evidence, neglected to secure an independent mental-health expert, and requested and relied on a presentence investigation report without objecting to damaging evidence it contained. SeeVan Hookv.Anderson, F. 3d , (). The en banc Sixth Circuit again vacated the panel’s opinion, but rather than hearing the case a second time it remanded for the panel to revise its opinion. SeeVan Hookv.Anderson, F. 3d , (). In its third opinion, the panel—relying on guidelines published by the American Bar Association (ABA) in —granted relief to Van Hook on the sole ground that his lawyers performed deficiently in investigating and presenting mitigating evidence. Seeid., at . The State petitioned for a writ of certiorari. We grant the petition and reverse.IIBecause Van Hook filed his federal habeas petition before April , , the provisions of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of do not apply. SeeLindhv.Murphy, U. S. , (). Even without the Act’s added layer of deference to state-court judgments, we cannot agree with the Court of Appeals that Van Hook is entitled to relief.AThe Sixth Amendment entitles criminal defendants to the “ ‘effective assistance of counsel’ ”—that is, representation that does not fall “below an objective standard of reasonableness” in light of “prevailing professional norms.”Stricklandv.Washington, U. S. , () (quotingMcMannv.Richardson, U. S. , , n. ()). That standard is necessarily a general one. “No particular set of detailed rules for counsel’s conduct can satisfactorily take account of the variety of circumstances faced by defense counsel or the range of legitimate decisions regarding how best to represent a criminal defendant.” U. S.,at –. Restatements of professional standards, we have recognized, can be useful as “guides” to what reasonableness entails, but only to the extent they describe the professional norms prevailing when the representation took place.Id., at .The Sixth Circuit ignored this limiting principle, relying on ABA guidelines announced years after Van Hook went to trial. See F. 3d, at – (quoting ABA Guidelines for the Appointment and Performance of Defense Counsel in Death Penalty Cases .7, comment., pp. – (rev. ed. )). The ABA standards in effect in described defense counsel’s duty to investigate both the merits and mitigating circumstances in general terms: “It is the duty of the lawyer to conduct a prompt investigation of the circumstances of the case and to explore all avenues leading to facts relevant to the merits of the case and the penalty in the event of conviction.” 1 ABA Standards for Criminal Justice 4–4.1, p. 4– (2d ed. ). The accompanying two-page commentary noted that defense counsel have “a substantial and important role to perform in raising mitigating factors,” and that “[i]nformation concerning the defendant’s background, education, employment record, mental and emotional stability, family relationships, and the like, will be relevant, as will mitigating circumstances surrounding the commission of the offense itself.”Id., at 4–.Quite different are the ABA’s -page “Guidelines” for capital defense counsel, published in , on which the Sixth Circuit relied. Those directives expanded what had been (in the Standards) a broad outline of defense counsel’s duties in all criminal cases into detailed prescriptions for legal representation of capital defendants. They discuss the duty to investigate mitigating evidence in exhaustive detail, specifying what attorneys should look for, where to look, and when to begin. See ABA Guidelines .7, comment., at –. They include, for example, the requirement that counsel’s investigation cover every period of the defendant’s life from “the moment of conception,”id., at , and that counsel contact “virtually everyone ... who knew [the defendant] and his family” and obtain records “concerning not only the client, but also his parents, grandparents, siblings, and children,”id., at . Judging counsel’s conduct in the ’s on the basis of these Guidelines—without even pausing to consider whether they reflected the prevailing professional practice at the time of the trial—was error.To make matters worse, the Court of Appeals (following Circuit precedent) treated the ABA’s Guidelines not merely as evidence of what reasonably diligent attorneys would do, but as inexorable commands with which all capital defense counsel “ ‘must fully comply.’ ” F. 3d, at (quotingDickersonv.Bagley, F. 3d , ( )).Stricklandstressed, however, that “American Bar Association standards and the like” are “only guides” to what reasonableness means, not its definition. U. S., at . We have since regarded them as such.[Footnote 1] SeeWigginsv.Smith, U. S. , (). What we have said of state requirements isa fortioritrue of standards set by private organizations: “[W]hile States are free to impose whatever specific rules they see fit to ensure that criminal defendants are well represented, we have held that the Federal Constitution imposes one general requirement: that counsel make objectively reasonable choices.”Roev.Flores-Ortega, U. S. , ().BVan Hook insists that the Sixth Circuit’s missteps made no difference because his counsel were ineffective even under professional standards prevailing at the time. He is wrong.Like the Court of Appeals, Van Hook first contends that his attorneys began their mitigation investigation too late, waiting until he was found guilty—only days before the sentencing hearing—to dig into his background. See F. 3d, at . But the record shows they started much sooner. Between Van Hook’s indictment and his trial less than three months later, they contacted their lay witnesses early and often: They spoke nine times with his mother (beginning within a week after the indictment), once with both parents together, twice with an aunt who lived with the family and often cared for Van Hook as a child, and three times with a family friend whom Van Hook visited immediately after the crime. App. to Pet. for Cert. 380a–383a, 384a–387a. As for their expert witnesses, they were in touch with one more than a month before trial, and they met with the other for two hours a week before the trial court reached its verdict.Id., at 382a, 386a. Moreover, after reviewing his military history, they met with a representative of the Veterans Administration seven weeks before trial and attempted to obtain his medical records.Id., at 381a, 386a. And they looked into enlisting a mitigation specialist when the trial was still five weeks away.Id., at 386a. The Sixth Circuit, in short, was simply incorrect in saying Van Hook’s lawyers waited until the “last minute.” F. 3d, at . Cf.Williamsv.Taylor, U. S. , () (counsel waited “until a week before the trial” to prepare for the sentencing phase).Nor was the scope of counsel’s investigation unreasonable.[Footnote 2] The Sixth Circuit said Van Hook’s attorneys found only “a little information about his traumatic childhood experience,” F. 3d, at , but that is a gross distortion. The trial court learned, for instance, that Van Hook (whose parents were both “heavy drinkers”) started drinking as a toddler, began “barhopping” with his father at age 9, drank and used drugs regularly with his father from age forward, and continued abusing drugs and alcohol into adulthood. App. to Pet. for Cert. 310a–312a, 323a–326a, 328a–330a, 373a. The court also heard that Van Hook grew up in a “ ‘combat zone’ ”: He watched his father beat his mother weekly, saw him hold her at gun- and knife-point, “observed” episodes of “sexual violence” while sleeping in his parents’ bedroom, and was beaten himself at least once.Id., at 321a, 338a–339a, 371a. It learned that Van Hook, who had “fantasies about killing and war” from an early age, was deeply upset when his drug and alcohol abuse forced him out of the military, and attempted suicide five times (including a month before the murder),id., at 351a–353a, 372a. And although the experts agreed that Van Hook did not suffer from a “mental disease or defect,” the trial court learned that Van Hook’s borderline personality disorder and his consumption of drugs and alcohol the day of the crime impaired “his ability to refrain from the [crime],”id., at 303a, and that his “explo[sion]” of “senseless and bizarre brutality” may have resulted from what one expert termed a “homosexual panic,”id.,at 376a.Despite all the mitigating evidence the defense did present, Van Hook and the Court of Appeals fault his counsel for failing to find more. What his counsel did discover, the argument goes, gave them “reason to suspect that much worse details existed,” and that suspicion should have prompted them to interview other family members—his stepsister, two uncles, and two aunts—as well as a psychiatrist who once treated his mother, all of whom “could have helped his counsel narrate the true story of Van Hook’s childhood experiences.” F. 3d, at . But there comes a point at which evidence from more distant relatives can reasonably be expected to be only cumulative, and the search for it distractive from more important duties. The ABA Standards prevailing at the time called for Van Hook’s counsel to cover several broad categories of mitigating evidence, see 1 ABA Standards 4–4.1, comment., at 4–, which they did. And given all the evidence they unearthed from those closest to Van Hook’s upbringing and the experts who reviewed his history, it was not unreasonable for his counsel not to identify and interview every other living family member or every therapist who once treated his parents. This is not a case in which the defendant’s attorneys failed to act while potentially powerful mitigating evidence stared them in the face, cf.Wiggins, U. S., at , or would have been apparent from documents any reasonable attorney would have obtained, cf.Rompillav.Beard, U. S. , – (). It is instead a case, likeStricklanditself, in which defense counsel’s “decision not to seek more” mitigating evidence from the defendant’s background “than was already in hand” fell “well within the range of professionally reasonable judgments.” U. S., at .[Footnote 3]What is more, even if Van Hook’s counsel performed deficiently by failing to dig deeper, he suffered no prejudice as a result. Seeid., at . As the Ohio court that rejected Van Hook’s state habeas petition found, the affidavits submitted by the witnesses not interviewed shows their testimony would have added nothing of value. SeeStatev.Van Hook, No. C–, WL , *2. Only two witnesses even arguably would have added new, relevant information: One of Van Hook’s uncles noted that Van Hook’s mother was temporarily committed to a psychiatric hospital, and Van Hook’s stepsister mentioned that his father hit Van Hook frequently and tried to kill Van Hook’s mother. App. to Pet. for Cert. 227a, 232a. But the trial court had already heard—from Van Hook’s mother herself—that she had been “under psychiatric care” more than once.Id., at 340a. And it was already aware that his father had a violent nature, had attacked Van Hook’s mother, and had beaten Van Hook at least once. See alsoid., at 305a (noting that Van Hook “suffered from a significant degree of neglect and abuse” throughout his “chaotic” childhood). Neither the Court of Appeals nor Van Hook has shown why the minor additional details the trial court did not hear would have made any difference.On the other side of the scales, moreover, was the evidence of the aggravating circumstance the trial court found: that Van Hook committed the murder alone in the course of an aggravated robbery. See Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §.(A)(7) (Lexis ). Van Hook’s confession made clear, and he never subsequently denied, both that he was the sole perpetrator of the crime and that “[h]is intention from beginning to end was to rob [Self] at some point in their evening’s activities.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 295a; seeid., at 276a–278a, 294a. Nor did he arrive at that intention on a whim: Van Hook had previously pursued the same strategy—of luring homosexual men into secluded settings to rob them—many times since his teenage years, and he employed it again even after Self’s murder in the weeks before his arrest. Seeid., at 279a, 295a, 374a. Although Van Hook apparently deviated from his original plan once the offense was underway—going beyond stealing Self’s goods to killing him and disfiguring the dead body—that hardly helped his cause. The Sixth Circuit, which focused on thenumberof aggravating factors instead of theirweight, see F. 3d, at ; cf. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §.(B), gave all this evidence short shrift, leading it to overstate further the effect additional mitigating evidence might have had.* * *The petition for certiorari and the motion for leave to proceedin forma pauperisare granted. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.Footnote 1The narrow grounds for our opinion should not be regarded as accepting the legitimacy of a less categorical use of the Guidelines to evaluate post- representation. For that to be proper, the Guidelines must reflect “[p]revailing norms of practice,”Strickland, U. S., at , and “standard practice,”Wigginsv. Smith, U. S. , (), and must not be so detailed that they would “interfere with the constitutionally protected independence of counsel and restrict the wide latitude counsel must have in making tactical decisions,”Strickland,supra, at . We express no views on whether the Guidelines meet these criteria.Footnote 2In his brief in this Court, Van Hook also alludes to his counsel’s failure to obtain an independent mental-health expert and their reliance on (and failure to object to harmful evidence in) a presentence investigation report—grounds on which the Sixth Circuit panel previously relied but which it abandoned in its final opinion. Seesupra, at 2–3. Van Hook now concedes, however, that neither ground is a “basis for issuing the writ,” Brief in Opposition 5; see alsoid., at 7, and accordingly we do not address them.Footnote 3In addition to the evidence the Sixth Circuit said his attorneys overlooked, Van Hook alleges that his lawyers failed to provide the expert witnesses with a “complete set of relevant records or [his] complete psycho-social history.” Brief in Opposition 4. But he offers no support for that assertion. He further claims that his counsel failed to obtain or present records of his military service and prior hospitalizations, but the record shows that they did review the former, see App. to Pet. for Cert. 380a, and that the trial court learned (from one of the written expert reports) all the relevant information Van Hook says it would have gleaned from the latter, seeid., at 373a–377a."}
{"file_name": "per curiam_2013_3_571.json", "author": "per curiam", "year": 2013, "text": "–. Decided November 4, 2013Per Curiam.Around one o’clock in the morning on May , , Officer Mike Stanton and his partner responded to a call about an “unknown disturbance” involving a person with a baseball bat in La Mesa, California. App. to Pet. for Cert. 6. Stanton was familiar with the neighborhood, known for “violence associated with the area gangs.”Ibid.The officers—wearing uniforms and driving a marked police vehicle—approached the place where the disturbance had been reported and noticed three men walking in the street. Upon seeing the police car, two of the men turned into a nearby apartment complex. The third, Nicholas Patrick, crossed the street about yards in front of Stanton’s car and ran or quickly walked toward a residence.Id.,at 7, . Nothing in the record shows that Stanton knew at the time whether that residence belonged to Patrick or someone else; in fact, it belonged to Drendolyn Sims.Stanton did not see Patrick with a baseball bat, but he considered Patrick’s behavior suspicious and decided to detain him in order to investigate.Ibid.; seeTerryv.Ohio, U.S. 1().Stanton exited his patrol car, called out “police,” and ordered Patrick to stop in a voice loud enough for all in the area to hear. App. to Pet. for Cert. 7. But Patrick did not stop. Instead, he “looked directly at Stanton, ignored his lawful orders[,] and quickly went through [the] front gate” of a fence enclosing Sims’ front yard.Id.,at (alterations omitted). When the gate closed behind Patrick, the fence—which was more than six feet tall and made of wood—blocked Stanton’s view of the yard. Stanton believed that Patrick had committed a jailable misdemeanor under California Penal Code § by disobeying his order to stop;[1] Stanton also “fear[ed] for [his] safety.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 7. He accordingly made the “split-second decision” to kick open the gate in pursuit of Patrick.Ibid.Unfortunately, and unbeknownst to Stanton, Sims herself was standing behind the gate when it flew open. The swinging gate struck Sims, cutting her forehead and injuring her shoulder.Sims filed suit against Stanton in Federal District Court under Rev. Stat. §, U. S. C. §, alleging that Stanton unreasonably searched her home without a warrant in violation of the Fourth Amendment. The District Court granted summary judgment to Stanton, finding that: (1) Stanton’s entry was justified by the potentially dangerous situation, by the need to pursue Patrick as he fled, and by Sims’ lesser expectation of privacy in the curtilage of her home; and (2) even if a constitutional violation had occurred, Stanton was entitled to qualified immunity because no clearly established law put him on notice that his conduct was unconstitutional.Sims appealed, and a panel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed. F.3d (). The court held that Stanton’s warrantless entry into Sims’ yard was unconstitutional because Sims was entitled to the same expectation of privacy in her curtilage as in her home itself, because there was no immediate danger, and because Patrick had committed only the minor offense of disobeying a police officer.Id.,at –. The court also found the law to be clearly established that Stanton’s pursuit of Patrick did not justify his warrantless entry, given that Patrick was suspected of only a misdemeanor.Id.,at –. The court accordingly held that Stanton was not entitled to qualified immunity.Id.,at –. We address only the latter holding here, and now reverse.“The doctrine of qualified immunity protects government officials ‘from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.’ ”Pearsonv.Callahan, U.S. , () (quotingHarlowv.Fitzgerald, U.S. , ()). “Qualified immunity gives government officials breathing room to make reasonable but mistaken judgments,” and “protects ‘all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.’ ”Ashcroftv.al-Kidd, U. S., at ) (quotingMalleyv.Briggs, U.S. , ()). “We do not require a case directly on point” before concluding that the law is clearly established, “but existing precedent must have placed the statutory or constitutional question beyond debate.”al-Kidd, U. S., at 9).There is no suggestion in this case that Officer Stanton knowingly violated the Constitution; the question is whether, in light of precedent existing at the time, he was “plainly incompetent” in entering Sims’ yard to pursue the fleeing Patrick.Id., at ). The Ninth Circuit concluded that he was. It did so despite the fact that federal and state courts nationwide are sharply divided on the question whether an officer with probable cause to arrest a suspect for a misdemeanor may enter a home without a warrant while in hot pursuit of that suspect. Compare,e.g.,Middletownv.Flinchum, Ohio St. 3d , , N.E.2d , () (“We . . . hold today that when officers, having identified themselves, are in hot pursuit of a suspect who flees to a house in order to avoid arrest, the police may enter without a warrant, regardless of whether the offense for which the suspect is being arrested is a misdemeanor”), andStatev.Ricci, N. H. , , A.2d , () (“the facts of this case demonstrate that the police had probable cause to arrest the defendant for the misdemeanor offense of dis- obeying a police officer” where the defendant had fled into his home with police officers in hot pursuit), withMas- corrov.Billings, F.3d , ( ) (“The warrantless entry based on hot pursuit was not justified” where “[t]he intended arrest was for a traffic misdemeanor committed by a minor, with whom the officer was well acquainted, who had fled into his family home from which there was only one exit” (footnote omitted)), andButlerv.State, Ark. , , S.W.2d ,() (“even though Officer Sudduth might have been under the impression that he was in continuous pursuit of Butler for what he considered to be the crime of disorderly conduct, . . . since the crime is a minor offense, under these circumstances there is no exigent circumstance that would allow Officer Sudduth’s warrantless entry into Butler’s home for what is concededly, at most, a petty disturbance”).Other courts have concluded that police officers are at least entitled to qualified immunity in these circumstances because the constitutional violation is not clearly established.E.g., Grenierv.Champlin, F.3d , ( ) (“Putting firmly to one side the merits of whether the home arrests were constitutional, we cannot say that only a plainly incompetent policeman could have thought them permissible at the time,” where officers entered a home without a warrant in hot pursuit of misdemeanor suspects who had defied the officers’ order to remain outside (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).Notwithstanding this basic disagreement, the Ninth Circuit below denied Stanton qualified immunity. In its one-paragraph analysis on the hot pursuit point, the panel relied on two cases, one from this Court,Welshv.Wisconsin, U.S. , (), and one from its own,United Statesv.Johnson, F.3d , () (en banc) (per curiam). Neither case clearly establishes that Stanton violated Sims’ Fourth Amendment rights.InWelsh, police officers learned from a witness that Edward Welsh had driven his car off the road and then left the scene, presumably because he was drunk. Acting on that tip, the officers went to Welsh’s home without a warrant, entered without consent, and arrested him for driving while intoxicated—a nonjailable traffic offense under state law. U. S., at –. Our opinion first noted our precedent holding that hot pursuit of a fleeing felon justifies an officer’s warrantless entry.Id.,at (citingUnited Statesv.Santana, U.S. , – ()). But we rejected the suggestion that the hot pursuit exception applied: “there was no immediate or continuous pursuit of [Welsh] from the scene of a crime.” U. S., at . We went on to conclude that the officers’ entry violated the Fourth Amendment, finding it “important” that “there [was] probable cause to believe that only a minor offense . . . ha[d] been committed.”Ibid.In those circumstances, we said, “application of the exigent-circumstances exception in the context of a home entry should rarely be sanctioned.”Ibid.But we did not lay down a categorical rule for all cases involving minor offenses, saying only that a warrant is “usually” required.Id., at .InJohnson, police officers broke into Michael Johnson’s fenced yard in search of another person (Steven Smith) whom they were attempting to apprehend on five misdemeanor arrest warrants. F. 3d, at –. The Ninth Circuit was clear that this case, likeWelsh, did not involve hot pursuit: “the facts of this case simply are not covered by the ‘hot pursuit’ doctrine” because Smith had escaped from the police minutes prior and his where- abouts were unknown. F. 3d, at . The court held that the officers’ entry required a warrant, in part because Smith was wanted for only misdemeanor offenses. Then, in a footnote, the court said: “In situations where an officer is truly in hot pursuit and the underlying offense is a felony, the Fourth Amendment usually yields [to law enforcement’s interest in apprehending a fleeing suspect]. See [Santana,supra, at –]. However, in situations where the underlying offense is only a misdemeanor, law enforcement must yield to the Fourth Amendment in all but the ‘rarest’ cases.Welsh, [supra, at ].”Johnson,supra, at , n. 6.In concluding—as it must have—that Stanton was “plainly incompetent,”al-Kidd, U. S., at ), the Ninth Circuit below readWelshand the footnote inJohnsonfar too broadly. First, both of those cases citedSantanawith approval, a case thatapprovedan officer’s warrantless entry while in hot pursuit. And thoughSantanainvolved a felony suspect, we did not expressly limit our holding based on that fact. See U. S., at (“The only remaining question is whether [the suspect’s] act of retreating into her house could thwart an otherwise proper arrest. We hold that it could not”). Second, to repeat, neitherWelshnorJohnsoninvolved hot pursuit.Welsh,supra, at ;Johnson,supra, at . Thus, despite our emphasis inWelshon the fact that the crime at issue was minor—indeed, a mere nonjailable civil offense—nothing in the opinion establishes that the seriousness of the crime is equally importantin cases of hot pursuit. Third, even in the portion ofWelshcited by the Ninth Circuit below, our opinion is equivocal: We held not that warrantless entry to arrest a misdemeanant is never justified, but only that such entry should be rare. U. S., at .That is in fact how two California state courts have readWelsh. In bothPeoplev.Lloyd, Cal. App. 3d , , Cal. Rptr. , (), andIn re Lavoyne M., Cal. App. 3d , , Cal. Rptr. , (), the California Court of Appeal refused to limit the hot pursuit exception to felony suspects. The court stated inLloyd: “Where the pursuit into the home was based on an arrest set in motion in a public place, the fact that the offenses justifying the initial detention or arrest were misdemeanors is of no significance in determining the validity of the entry without a warrant.” Cal. App. 3d, at , Cal. Rptr., at . It is especially troubling that the Ninth Circuit would conclude that Stanton was plainly incompetent—and subject to personal liability for damages—based on actions that were lawful according to courts in the jurisdiction where he acted. Cf., concurring) (slip op., at 2–4).Finally, our determination thatWelshandJohnsonare insufficient to overcome Stanton’s qualified immunity is bolstered by the fact that, even afterJohnson, two different District Courts in the Ninth Circuit have granted qualified immunity precisely because the law regarding warrantless entry in hot pursuit of a fleeing misdemeanant is not clearly established. SeeKolesnikovv.Sacramento County, No. S––, WL , *7 (ED Cal., Apr. , ) (“sinceWelsh, it has not been clearly established that there can never be warrantless home arrests in the context of a ‘hot pursuit’ of a suspect fleeing from the commission of misdemeanor offenses”);Garciav.Imperial, No. –, WL , *6, n. 4 (SD Cal., Sept. , ). InGarcia, a case with facts similar to those here, the District Court distinguishedJohnsonas a case where “the officers were not in hot pursuit of the suspect, had not seen the suspect enter the neighbor’s property, and had no real reason to think the suspect was there.” WL , *6, n. 4. Precisely the same facts distinguish this case fromJohnson: Stantonwasin hot pursuit of Patrick, hedidsee Patrick enter Sims’ property, and he had every reason to believe that Patrick was just beyond Sims’ gate. App. to Pet. for Cert. 6–7, .To summarize the law at the time Stanton made his split-second decision to enter Sims’ yard: Two opinions of this Court were equivocal on the lawfulness of his entry; two opinions of the State Court of Appeal affirmatively authorized that entry; the most relevant opinion of the Ninth Circuit was readily distinguishable; two Federal District Courts in the Ninth Circuit had granted qualified immunity in the wake of that opinion; and the federal and state courts of last resort around the Nation were sharply divided.We do not express any view on whether Officer Stanton’s entry into Sims’ yard in pursuit of Patrick was constitutional. But whether or not the constitutional rule applied by the court below was correct, it was not “beyond debate., at 9). Stanton may have been mistaken in believing his actions were justified, but he was not “plainly incompetent.”Malley, U. S., at .The petition for certiorari and respondent’s motion for leave to proceedin forma pauperisare granted, the judgment of the Ninth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.“Every person who willfully resists, delays, or obstructs any . . . peace officer . . . in the discharge or attempt to discharge any duty of his or her office or employment . . . shall be punished by a fine not exceeding one thousand dollars ($1,), or by imprisonment in a county jail not to exceed one year, or by both that fine and imprisonment.” Cal.

Decided June , 2021Per Curiam.On the afternoon of December 8, , St. Louis police officers arrested Nicholas Gilbert for trespassing in a condemned building and failing to appear in court for a traffic ticket.[1] Officers brought him to the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department’s central station and placed him in a holding cell. At some point, an officer saw Gilbert tie a piece of clothing around the bars of his cell and put it around his neck, in an apparent attempt to hang himself. Three officers responded and entered Gilbert’s cell. One grabbed Gilbert’s wrist to handcuff him, but Gilbert evaded the officer and began to struggle. The three officers brought Gilbert, who was 5’3” and pounds, down to a kneeling position over a concrete bench in the cell and handcuffed his arms behind his back. Gilbert reared back, kicking the officers and hitting his head on the bench. After Gilbert kicked one of the officers in the groin, they called for more help and leg shackles. While Gilbert continued to struggle, two officers shackled his legs together. Emergency medical services personnel were phoned for assistance.Several more officers responded. They relieved two of the original three officers, leaving six officers in the cell with Gilbert, who was now handcuffed and in leg irons. The officers moved Gilbert to a prone position, face down on the floor. Three officers held Gilbert’s limbs down at the shoulders, biceps, and legs. At least one other placed pressure on Gilbert’s back and torso. Gilbert tried to raise his chest, saying, “ ‘It hurts. Stop.’ ”Lombardov.Saint Louis City, F. Supp. 3d , (ED Mo. ).After minutes of struggling in this position, Gilbert’s breathing became abnormal and he stopped moving. The officers rolled Gilbert onto his side and then his back to check for a pulse. Finding none, they performed chest compressions and rescue breathing. An ambulance eventually transported Gilbert to the hospital, where he was pronounced dead.Gilbert’s parents sued, alleging that the officers had used excessive force against him. The District Court granted summary judgment in favor of the officers, concluding that they were entitled to qualified immunity because they did not violate a constitutional right that was clearly established at the time of the incident.Id.,at . The U. S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed on different grounds, holding that the officers did not apply unconstitutionally excessive force against Gilbert. F.3d , ().In assessing a claim of excessive force, courts ask “whether the officers’ actions are ‘objectively reasonable’ in light of the facts and circumstances confronting them.”Grahamv.Connor, U.S. , ().[2] “A court (judge or jury) cannot apply this standard mechanically.”Kingsleyv.Hendrickson, U.S. , (). Rather, the inquiry “requires careful attention to the facts and circumstances of each particular case.”Graham, U. S., at . Those circumstances include “the relationship between the need for the use of force and the amount of force used; the extent of the plaintiff ’s injury; any effort made by the officer to temper or to limit the amount of force; the severity of the security problem at issue; the threat reasonably perceived by the officer; and whether the plaintiff was actively resisting.”Kingsley, U. S., at .Although the Eighth Circuit cited theKingsleyfactors, it is unclear whether the court thought the use of a prone restraint—no matter the kind, intensity, duration, or surrounding circumstances—isper seconstitutional so long as an individual appears to resist officers’ efforts to subdue him. The court cited Circuit precedent for the proposition that “the use of prone restraint is not objectively unreasonable when a detainee actively resists officer directives and efforts to subdue the detainee.” F. 3d, at . The court went on to describe as “insignificant” facts that may distinguish that precedent and appear potentially important underKingsley, including that Gilbert was already handcuffed and leg shackled when officers moved him to the prone position and that officers kept him in that position for minutes. See F. 3d, at –.Such details could matter when deciding whether to grant summary judgment on an excessive force claim. Here, for example, record evidence (viewed in the light most favorable to Gilbert’s parents) shows that officers placed pressure on Gilbert’s back even though St. Louis instructs its officers that pressing down on the back of a prone subject can cause suffocation. The evidentiary record also includes well-known police guidance recommending that officers get a subject off his stomach as soon as he is handcuffed because of that risk. The guidance further indicates that the struggles of a prone suspect may be due to oxygen deficiency, rather than a desire to disobey officers’ commands. Such evidence, when considered alongside the duration of the restraint and the fact that Gilbert was handcuffed and leg shackled at the time, may be pertinent to the relationship between the need for the use of force and the amount of force used, the security problem at issue, and the threat—to both Gilbert and others—reasonably perceived by the officers. Having either failed to analyze such evidence or characterized it as insignificant, the court’s opinion could be read to treat Gilbert’s “ongoing resistance” as controlling as a matter of law.[3]Id., at . Such aper serule would contravene the careful, context-specific analysis required by this Court’s excessive force precedent.We express no view as to whether the officers used unconstitutionally excessive force or, if they did, whether Gilbert’s right to be free of such force in these circumstances was clearly established at the time of his death. We instead grant the petition for certiorari, vacate the judgment of the Eighth Circuit, and remand the case to give the court the opportunity to employ an inquiry that clearly attends to the facts and circumstances in answering those questions in the first instance.It is so ordered.Notes1Because this case was decided by summary judgment, the evidence here recounted is viewed “ ‘in the light most favorable’ ” to the nonmoving party (here, Gilbert’s parents, the petitioners).Tolanv.Cotton, U.S. , – () (per curiam).2Petitioners brought their excessive force claims under both the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. See,e.g.,First Amended Complaint in No. 4:–cv–, ECF Doc. (ED Mo.), p. . We need not address whether the Fourth or Fourteenth Amendment provides the proper basis for a claim of excessive force against a pretrial detainee in Gilbert’s position. Whatever the source of law, in analyzing an excessive force claim, a court must determine whether the force was objectively unreasonable in light of the “ ‘facts and circumstances of each particular case.’ ”Kingsleyv.Hendrickson, U.S. , () (quotingGraham, U. S., at ).3While the dissent suggests we should give the Eighth Circuit the benefit of the doubt, in assessing the appropriateness of review in this factbound context, it is more prudent to afford the Eighth Circuit an opportunity to clarify its opinion rather than to speculate as to its basis."}

MARCHIO, executrix of the ESTATE OF PAULINE VIRGINIA WILLETTon petitions for writs of certiorari to the supreme court of appeals of west virginiaNos. – and –. Decided February , 2012Per Curiam.State and federal courts must enforce the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9 U. S. C. §1et seq., with respect to all arbitration agreements covered by that statute. Here, the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia, by misreading and disregarding the precedents of this Court interpreting the FAA, did not follow controlling federal law implementing that basic principle. The state court held unenforce- able all predispute arbitration agreements that apply to claims alleging personal injury or wrongful death against nursing homes.The decision of the state court found the FAA’s coverage to be more limited than mandated by this Court’s previous cases. The decision of the State Supreme Court of Appeals must be vacated. When this Court has fulfilled its duty to interpret federal law, a state court may not contradict or fail to implement the rule so established. See U. S. Const., Art. VI, cl. 2.IThis litigation involves three negligence suits against nursing homes in West Virginia. The suits were brought by Clayton Brown, Jeffrey Taylor, and Sharon Marchio. In each case, a family member of a patient requiring extensive nursing care had signed an agreement with a nursing home on behalf of the patient. The relevant parts of the agreements in Brown’s case and Taylor’s case were identical. The contracts included a clause requiring the parties to arbitrate all disputes, other than claims to col- lect late payments owed by the patient. The contracts included a provision holding the party filing the arbitration responsible for paying a filing fee in accordance with the Rules of the American Arbitration Association fee schedules. The agreement in Marchio’s case also included a clause requiring arbitration but made no exceptions to the arbitration requirement and did not mention filing fees.In each of the three cases, a family member of a patient who had died sued the nursing home in state court, alleging that negligence caused injuries or harm resulting in death. A state trial court dismissed the suits by Brown and Taylor based on the agreements to arbitrate. The Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia consolidated those cases with Marchio’s, which was before the court on other issues.In a decision concerning all three cases, the state court held that “as a matter of public policy under West Virginia law, an arbitration clause in a nursing home admission agreement adopted prior to an occurrence of negligence that results in a personal injury or wrongful death, shall not be enforced to compel arbitration of a dispute concerning the negligence.”Brownv.Genesis Healthcare Corp., No. (W. Va., June , ), App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. –, pp. 85a–86a (hereinafter Pet. App.). The state court considered whether the state public policy was pre-empted by the FAA. The state court found unpersuasive this Court’s interpretation of the FAA, calling it “tendentious,”id., at 51a, and “created from whole cloth,”id., at 53a. It later concluded that “Congress did not intend for the FAA to be, in any way, applicable to personal injury or wrongful death suits that only collaterally derive from a written agreement that evidences a transaction affecting interstate commerce, particularly where the agreement involves a service that is a practical necessity for members of the public,”id., at 84a. The court thus concluded that the FAA does not pre-empt the state pub- lic policy against predispute arbitration agreements that apply to claims of personal injury or wrongful death against nursing homes.The West Virginia court’s interpretation of the FAA was both incorrect and inconsistent with clear instruction in the precedents of this Court. The FAA provides that a “written provision in . . . a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out of such contract or transaction . . . shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.” 9 U. S. C. §2. The statute’s text includes no exception for personal-injury or wrongful-death claims. It “requires courts to enforce the bargain of the parties to arbitrate.”Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.v.Byrd, U.S. , (). It “reflects an emphatic federal policy in favor of arbitral dispute resolution.”KPMG LLPv.Cocchi, U. S., at 3) (quotingMitsubishi Motors Corp.v.Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., U.S. , (); internal quotation marks omitted).As this Court reaffirmed last Term, “[w]hen state law prohibits outright the arbitration of a particular type of claim, the analysis is straightforward: The conflicting rule is displaced by the FAA.”AT&T Mobility LLCv.Concepcion, U. S., at 6–7). That rule resolves these cases. West Virginia’s prohibition against predispute agreements to arbitrate personal-injury or wrongful-death claims against nursing homes is a cate- gorical rule prohibiting arbitration of a particular type of claim, and that rule is contrary to the terms and coverage of the FAA. Seeibid.See also,e.g., Prestonv.Ferrer, U.S. , () (FAA pre-empts state law granting state commissioner exclusive jurisdiction to decide issue the parties agreed to arbitrate);Mastrobuonov.Shearson Lehman Hutton, Inc., U.S. , () (FAA pre-empts state law requiring judicial resolution of claims involving punitive damages);Perryv.[REDACTED], U.S. , () (FAA pre-empts state-law requirement that litigants be provided a judicial forum for wage disputes);Southland Corp.v.Keating, U.S. 1, () (FAA pre-empts state financial investment statute’s prohibition of arbitration of claims brought under that statute).IIThe West Virginia court proposed an “alternativ[e]” hold- ing that the particular arbitration clauses in Brown’s case and Taylor’s case were unconscionable. Pet. App. 89a–91a, 94a. See alsoid., at 98a (not addressing the question whether the arbitration agreement in Marchio’s case is unenforceable for reasons other than public policy). It is unclear, however, to what degree the state court’s alternative holding was influenced by the invalid, categorical rule discussed above, the rule against predispute arbitration agreements. For example, in its discussion of the alternative holding, the state court found the arbitration clauses unconscionable in part because a predispute arbitration agreement that applies to claims of personal injury or wrongful death against nursing homes “clearly violates public policy.”Id.,at 91a.On remand, the West Virginia court must consider whether, absent that general public policy, the arbitration clauses in Brown’s case and Taylor’s case are unenforce- able under state common law principles that are not specific to arbitration and pre-empted by the FAA.* * *The petition for certiorari is granted. The judgment of the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia is vacated, and the cases are remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.It is so ordered."}

Decided November 2, 2020Per Curiam.Petitioner DeRay Mckesson organized a demonstration in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, to protest a shooting by a local police officer. The protesters, allegedly at Mckesson’s direction, occupied the highway in front of the police headquarters. As officers began making arrests to clear the highway, an unknown individual threw a “piece of concrete or a similar rock-like object,” striking respondent Officer Doe in the face. F.3d , ( ). Officer Doe suffered devastating injuries in the line of duty, including loss of teeth and brain trauma.Though the culprit remains unidentified, Officer Doe sought to recover damages from Mckesson on the theory that he negligently staged the protest in a manner that caused the assault. The District Court dismissed the negligence claim as barred by the First Amendment. F. Supp. 3d , – (MD La. ).A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed. As the Fifth Circuit recognized at the outset, Louisiana law generally imposes no “ ‘duty to protect others from the criminal activities of third persons.’ ” F. 3d, at (quotingPosecaiv.Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., –, p. 5 (La. //), So. 2d , ). But the panel majority held that a jury could plausibly find that Mckesson breached his “duty not to negligently precipitate the crime of a third party” because “a violent confrontation with a police officer was a foreseeable effect of negligently directing a protest” onto the highway. F. 3d, at . The dissent would have demanded something more—a “special relationship” between Mckesson and Officer Doe—before recognizing such a duty under Louisiana law.Id.,at –, and n. (Willett, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). The dissent likewise doubted that an intentional assault is the “particular risk” for which Officer Doe could recover for a breach of “Louisiana’s prohibitions on highway-blocking,” which “have as their focus the protection of other motorists.”Id.,at , n. (internal quotation marks omitted).The panel majority also rejected Mckesson’s argument thatNAACPv.Claiborne Hardware Co., U.S. (), forbids liability for speech-related activity that negligently causes a violent act unless the defendant specifically intended that the violent act would result. According to the Fifth Circuit, the First Amendment imposes no barrier to tort liability so long as the rock-throwing incident was “one of the ‘consequences’ of ‘tortious activity,’ which itself was ‘authorized, directed, or ratified’ by Mckesson in violation of his duty of care.” F. 3d, at (quotingClaiborne Hardware, U. S., at ). Because Mckesson allegedly directed an unlawful obstruction of a highway, see La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §: (West ), the Fifth Circuit held that the First Amendment did not shield him from liability for the downstream consequences. F. 3d, at . Again, the dissent disagreed, deeming the “novel ‘negligent protest’ theory of liability” to be “incompatible with the First Amendment and foreclosed—squarely—by”Claiborne Hardware. F. 3d, at (opinion of Willett, J.).The Fifth Circuit subsequently deadlocked 8 to 8 on Mckesson’s petition for rehearing en banc. F.3d , () (per curiam). Members of the Court of Appeals wrote separately to express further disagreement with both the panel decision’s interpretation of state law,id.,at (Higginson, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc), and its application ofClaiborne Hardware, F. 3d, at (Dennis, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc).The question presented for our review is whether the theory of personal liability adopted by the Fifth Circuit violates the First Amendment. When violence occurs during activity protected by the First Amendment, that provision mandates “precision of regulation” with respect to “the grounds that may give rise to damages liability” as well as “the persons who may be held accountable for those damages.”Claiborne Hardware, U. S., at – (internal quotation marks omitted). Mckesson contends that his role in leading the protest onto the highway, even if negligent and punishable as a misdemeanor, cannot make him personally liable for the violent act of an individual whose only association with him was attendance at the protest.We think that the Fifth Circuit’s interpretation of state law is too uncertain a premise on which to address the question presented. The constitutional issue, though undeniably important, is implicated only if Louisiana law permits recovery under these circumstances in the first place. The dispute thus could be “greatly simplifie[d]” by guidance from the Louisiana Supreme Court on the meaning of Louisiana law.Bellottiv.Baird, U.S. , ().Fortunately, the Rules of the Louisiana Supreme Court, like the rules of other States, provide an opportunity to obtain such guidance. In the absence of “clear controlling precedents in the decisions of the” Louisiana Supreme Court, those Rules specify that the federal courts of appeals may certify dispositive questions of Louisiana law on their own accord or on motion of a party. La. Sup. Ct. Rule , §§1–2 (). Certification is by no means “obligatory” merely because state law is unsettled; the choice instead rests “in the sound discretion of the federal court.”Lehman Brothersv.Schein, U.S. , (). Federal courts have only rarely resorted to state certification procedures, which can prolong the dispute and increase the expenses incurred by the parties. Seeid.,at – (Rehnquist, J., concurring). Our system of “cooperative judicial federalism” presumes federal and state courts alike are competent to apply federal and state law.Id.,at (opinion of the Court); cf.Tafflinv.Levitt, U.S. , ().In exceptional instances, however, certification is advisable before addressing a constitutional issue. SeeBellotti, U. S., at ;Clayv.Sun Ins. Office Ltd., U.S. , (). Two aspects of this case, taken together, persuade us that the Court of Appeals should have certified to the Louisiana Supreme Court the questions (1) whether Mckesson could have breached a duty of care in organizing and leading the protest and (2) whether Officer Doe has alleged a particular risk within the scope of protection afforded by the duty, provided one exists. See F. 3d, at (opinion of Willett, J.).First, the dispute presents novel issues of state law peculiarly calling for the exercise of judgment by the state courts. SeeLehman Brothers, U. S., at . To impose a duty under Louisiana law, courts must consider “various moral, social, and economic factors,” among them “the fairness of imposing liability,” “the historical development of precedent,” and “the direction in which society and its institutions are evolving.”Posecai, So. 2d, at . “Speculation by a federal court about” how a state court would weigh, for instance, the moral value of protest against the economic consequences of withholding liability “is particularly gratuitous when the state courts stand willing to address questions of state law on certification.”Arizonans for Official Englishv.Arizona, U.S. , () (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted).Second, certification would ensure that any conflict in this case between state law and the First Amendment is not purely hypothetical. The novelty of the claim at issue here only underscores that “[w]arnings against premature adjudication of constitutional questions bear heightened attention when a federal court is asked to invalidate a State’s law.”Ibid.The Louisiana Supreme Court, to be sure, may announce the same duty as the Fifth Circuit. But under the unusual circumstances we confront here, we conclude that the Fifth Circuit should not have ventured into so uncertain an area of tort law—one laden with value judgments and fraught with implications for First Amendment rights—without first seeking guidance on potentially controlling Louisiana law from the Louisiana Supreme Court. We express no opinion on the propriety of the Fifth Circuit certifying or resolving on its own any other issues of state law that the parties may raise on remand.We therefore grant the petition for writ of certiorari, vacate the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, and remand the case to that court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.justice [REDACTED] took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.justice [REDACTED] dissents."}

LAMONE, ADMINISTRATOR, MARYLAND STATE BOARD OF ELECTIONS, et al.on appeal from the united states district court for the district of maryland[June , ]Per Curiam.This appeal arises from the denial of a motion for a preliminary injunction in the District Court. Appellants are several Republican voters, plaintiffs below, who allege that Maryland’s Sixth Congressional District was gerrymandered in for the purpose of retaliating against them for their political views.In May , six years after the Maryland General Assembly redrew the Sixth District, plaintiffs moved the District Court to enjoin Maryland’s election officials from holding congressional elections under the map. They asserted that “extend[ing] this constitutional offense”—i.e.,the alleged gerrymander—“into the election would be a manifest and irreparable injury.” Record in No. 1:–cv–, Doc. –1, p. 3. In order to allow time for the creation of a new districting map, plaintiffs urged the District Court to enter a preliminary injunction by August , .Id.,at .On August , , the District Court denied plaintiffs’ motion and stayed further proceedings pending this Court’s disposition of partisan gerrymandering claims inGillv.Whitford, No. –. F. Supp. 3d . The District Court found that plaintiffs had failed to show a likelihood of success on the merits sufficient to warrant a preliminary injunction.Id.,at –. The District Court also held that it was “in no position to award [p]laintiffs the remedy they . . . requested on the timetable they . . . demanded.”Id.,at . The court explained that, notwithstanding its “diligence in ruling on the pending preliminary injunction motion (which has been a priority for each member of this panel),” plaintiffs’ proposed August deadline for injunctive relief had “already come and gone.”Ibid.In addition, the District Court emphasized that it was concerned about “measuring the legality and constitutionality of any redistricting plan in Maryland . . . according to the proper legal standard.”Id.,at . In the District Court’s view, it would be “better equipped to make that legal determination and to chart a wise course for further proceedings” after this Court issued a decision inGill.Ibid.Plaintiffs ask this Court to vacate the District Court’s order and remand for further consideration of whether a preliminary injunction is appropriate.We now note our jurisdiction and review the District Court’s decision for an abuse of discretion, keeping in mind that a preliminary injunction is “an extraordinary remedy never awarded as of right.”Winterv.Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., U. S. 7, (). As a matter of equitable discretion, a preliminary injunction does not follow as a matter of course from a plaintiff’s showing of a likelihood of success on the merits.See id.,at . Rather, a court must also consider whether the mov-ant has shown “that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, that the balance of equities tips in his favor, and that an injunction is in the public interest.”Id.,at .Plaintiffs made no such showing below. Even if we assume—contrary to the findings of the District Court—that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their claims, the balance of equities and the public interest tilted against their request for a preliminary injunction.First, a party requesting a preliminary injunction must generally show reasonable diligence. Cf.Holmbergv.Armbrecht, U. S. , (). That is as true in election law cases as elsewhere. SeeLucasv.Townsend, U. S. , () ([REDACTED], J., in chambers);Fishmanv.Schaffer, U. S. , () (Marshall, J., in chambers). In this case, appellants did not move for a preliminary injunction in the District Court until six years, and three general elections, after the map was adopted, and over three years after the plaintiffs’ first complaint was filed.Plaintiffs argue that they have nevertheless pursued their claims diligently, and they attribute their delay in seeking a preliminary injunction to the “convoluted procedural history of the case” and the “dogged refusal to cooperate in discovery” by state officials. Reply Brief . Yet the record suggests that the delay largely arose from a circumstance within plaintiffs’ control: namely, their failure to plead the claims giving rise to their request for preliminary injunctive relief until . Although one of the seven plaintiffs before us filed a complaint in alleging that Maryland’s congressional map was an unconstitutional gerrymander, that initial complaint did not present the retaliation theory asserted here. See Amended Complaint, Doc. , p. 3 (Dec. 2, ) (explaining that the gerrymandering claim did not turn upon “the reason or intent of the legislature” in adopting the map).It was not until that the remaining plaintiffs joined the case and filed an amended complaint alleging that Maryland officials intentionally retaliated against them because of their political views. See 3 App. –. Plaintiffs’ newly presented claims—unlike the gerrymandering claim presented in the complaint—required discovery into the motives of the officials who produced the congressional map. See,e.g.,Memorandum of Law in Support of Plaintiffs’ Motion to Compel, Doc. –1, p. 3 (Jan. 4, ) (describing plaintiffs’ demand that various state officials “testify . . . and answer questions concerning legislative intent”). It is true that the assertion of legislative privilege by those officials delayed the completion of that discovery. See Joint Motion To Extend Deadlines for Completion of Fact Discovery and Expert Witness Disclosures, Doc. , pp. 1–2 (Mar. 3, ); Joint Motion To Extend Deadlines for Completion of Fact Discovery and Expert Witness Disclosures, Doc. , pp. 1–2 (Mar. , ). But that does not change the fact that plaintiffs could have sought a preliminary injunction much earlier. SeeFishman,supra, at . In considering the balance of equities among the parties, we think that plaintiffs’ unnecessary, years-long delay in asking for preliminary injunctive relief weighed against their request.Second, a due regard for the public interest in orderly elections supported the District Court’s discretionary decision to deny a preliminary injunction and to stay the proceedings. SeePurcellv.Gonzalez, U. S. 1, 4–5 () (per curiam). Plaintiffs themselves represented to the District Court that any injunctive relief would have to be granted by August , , to ensure the timely completion of a new districting scheme in advance of the election season. Despite the District Court’s undisputedly diligent efforts, however, that date had “already come and gone” by the time the court ruled on plaintiffs’ motion. F. Supp. 3d, at . (Such deadline has also, of course, long since passed for purposes of entering a preliminary injunction on remand from this Court.)On top of this time constraint was the legal uncertainty surrounding any potential remedy for the plaintiffs’ asserted injury. At the time the District Court made its decision, the appeal inGillwas pending before this Court. The District Court recognized that our decision inGillhad the potential to “shed light on critical questions in this case” and to set forth a “framework” by which plaintiffs’ claims could be decided and, potentially, remedied. F. Supp. 3d, at –. In the District Court’s view, “charging ahead” and adjudicating the plaintiffs’ claims in that fluctuating legal environment, when firmer guidance from this Court might have been forthcoming, would have been a mistake.Id.,at . Such a determination was within the sound discretion of the District Court. Given the District Court’s decision to wait for this Court’s ruling inGillbefore further adjudicating plaintiffs’ claims, the court reasonably could have concluded that a preliminary injunction would have been against the public interest, as an injunction might have worked a needlessly “chaotic and disruptive effect upon the electoral process,”Fishman,supra, at , and because the “purpose of a preliminary injunction is merely to preserve the relative positions of the parties until a trial on the merits can be held,”University of Tex.v.Camenisch, U. S. , (). In these particular circumstances, we conclude that the District Court’s decision denying a preliminary injunction cannot be regarded as an abuse of discretion.The order of the District Court isAffirmed."}

TENNANT, WEST VIRGINIA SECRETARY OF STATE, et al.v.JEFFERSON COUNTY COMMISSION, et al.on appeal from the united states district court for the southern district of west virginiaNo. –. Decided September , 2012Per Curiam.Plaintiffs in this case claim that West Virginia’s congressional redistricting plan violates the “one person, one vote” principle that we have held to be embodied in Article I, §2, of the United States Constitution. A three-judge District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia agreed, declaring the plan “null and void” and enjoining West Virginia’s Secretary of State from implementing it. App. to Juris. Statement 4. The state defendants appealed directly to this Court. See U. S. C. §. Because the District Court misapplied the standard for evaluating such challenges set out inKarcherv.Daggett, U.S. (), and failed to afford appropriate deference to West Virginia’s reasonable exercise of its political judgment, we reverse.* * *Article I, §2, of the United States Constitution requires that Members of the House of Representatives “be ap- portioned among the several States . . . according to their respective Numbers” and “chosen every second Year by the People of the several States.” InWesberryv.Sanders, U.S. 1(), we held that these commands require that “as nearly as is practicable one man’s vote in a congressional election is to be worth as much as another’s.”Id.,at 7–8. We have since explained that the “as nearly as is practicable” standard does not require that congressional districts be drawn with “precise mathematical equality,” but instead that the State justify population differences between districts that could have been avoided by “a good-faith effort to achieve absolute equality.”Karcher,supra, at (quotingKirkpatrickv.Preisler, U.S. , – (); internal quotation marks omitted).Karcherset out a two-prong test to determine whether a State’s congressional redistricting plan meets this standard. First, the parties challenging the plan bear the burden of proving the existence of population differences that “could practicably be avoided.” U. S., at . If they do so, the burden shifts to the State to “show with some specificity” that the population differences “were necessary to achieve some legitimate state objective.”Id.,at , . This burden is a “flexible” one, which “depend[s] on the size of the deviations, the importance of the State’s interests, the consistency with which the plan as a whole reflects those interests, and the availability of alterna- tives that might substantially vindicate those interests yet approximate population equality more closely.”Id.,at . As we recently reaffirmed, redistricting “ordinarily involves criteria and standards that have been weighed and evaluated by the elected branches in the exercise of their political judgment.”Perryv.Perez, U. S., at 4). “[W]e are willing to defer to [such] state legislative policies, so long as they are consistent with constitutional norms, even if they require small differences in the population of congressional districts.”Karcher,supra, at .In this case, plaintiffs claim that West Virginia’s redistricting plan, adopted following the decennial United States census, violates Article I, §2, of the United States Constitution and, separately, the West Virginia Constitution. The census did not alter West Virginia’s allocation of three congressional seats. But due to popula- tion shifts within the State, West Virginia nonetheless began redistricting to comply with the requirements in our precedents.In August , the West Virginia Legislature convened an extraordinary session, and the State Senate formed a -member Select Committee on Redistricting. The committee first considered a redistricting plan championed by its chair, Majority Leader John Unger, and dubbed “the Perfect Plan” because it achieved a population difference of a single person between the largest and smallest districts. That appears, however, to have been the only perfect aspect of the Perfect Plan. State legislators expressed concern that the plan contravened the State’s longstanding rule against splitting counties, placed two incumbents’ residences in the same district, and moved one-third of the State’s population from one district to another.The following day, members of the Redistricting Committee introduced seven additional plans. The committee eventually reported to the full Senate the eighth proposal, referred to as S. B. . The full Senate rejected a ninth proposal offered as an amendment on the floor and adopted S. B. by a vote of to 4. The House of Delegates approved the bill without debate by a vote of to 5. Governor Earl Tomblin signed the bill into law on August , .S. B. , codified at W. Va. Code Ann. §1–2–3 (Lexis Supp.), does not split county lines, redistrict incumbents into the same district, or require dramatic shifts in the population of the current districts. Indeed, S. B. ’s chief selling point was that it required very little change to the existing districts: It moved just one county, representing 1.5% of the State’s population, from one district to another. This was the smallest shift of any plan considered by the legislature. S. B. , however, has a population variance of 0.%, the second highest variance of the plans the legislature considered. That is, the population difference between the largest and smallest districts in S. B. equals 0.% of the population of the average district.The Jefferson County Commission and two of its county commissioners sued to enjoin the State from implementing S. B. . At trial, the State conceded that it could have adopted a plan with lower population variations. The State argued, however, that legitimate state policies justified the slightly higher variances in S. B. , citing this Court’s statement fromKarcherthat “[a]ny number of consistently applied legislative policies might justify some variance, including, for instance, making districts com- pact, respecting municipal boundaries, preserving the cores of prior districts, and avoiding contests between incumbent Representatives.” U. S., at . The State notedKarcher’s approving reference to a District Court opinion upholding a previous West Virginia redistricting plan with a population variance of 0.%—virtually identical to the variance in S. B. . Seeid.,at – (citingWest Virginia Civil Liberties Unionv.Rockefeller, F. Supp. (SD W. Va. )).The District Court nonetheless granted the injunction, holding that the State’s asserted objectives did not justify the population variance. With respect to the objective of not splitting counties, the District Court acknowledged that West Virginia had never in its history divided a county between two or more congressional districts. The court speculated, however, that the practice ofotherStates dividing counties between districts “may portend the eventual deletion” of respecting such boundaries as a potentially legitimate justification for population variances. App. to Juris. Statement , n. 6. The court also faulted the West Virginia Legislature for failing “to create a contemporaneous record sufficient to show that S. B. ’s entire 4,-person variance—or even a discrete, numerically precise portion thereof—was attributable” to the State’s interest in respecting county boundaries and noted that several other plans under consideration also did not split counties.Id.,at , .The court further questioned the State’s assertion that S. B. best preserved the core of existing districts. Preserving the core of a district, the court reasoned, involved respecting the “ ‘[s]ocial, cultural, racial, ethnic, and economic interests common to the population of the area,’ ”id.,at (quotingGrahamv.Thornburgh, F. Supp. 2d , (Kan. )), not a “dogged insistence that change be minimized for the benefit of the delicate citi- zenry,” App. to Juris. Statement . The District Court concluded that although acclimating to a new congressional district and Congressperson “may give rise to a modicum of anxiety and inconvenience, avoiding constituent discomfort at the margins is not among those policies recognized inKarcheras capable of legitimizing a variance.”Ibid.With respect to preventing contests between incumbents, the District Court again faulted the legislature for failing to build a record “linking all or a specific part of the variance” to that asserted interest.Id., at . And the District Court found that although 0.% was a minor variation whenKarcherwas decided, the feasibility of achieving smaller variances due to improved technology meant that the same variance must now be considered major. Because the District Court concluded that the redistricting plan was unconstitutional under Article I, §2, it did not reach plaintiffs’ challenges under the West Virginia Constitution.Chief Judge Bailey dissented. He argued that the record demonstrated the legitimacy of the State’s concerns, and that no other plan satisfied all those concerns as well as S. B. . He also took issue with the majority’s disregard forKarcher’s characterization of 0.% as an acceptable disparity. App. to Juris. Statement .We stayed the District Court’s order pending appeal to this Court, U. S.Given the State’s concession that it could achieve smaller population variations, the remaining question underKar- cheris whether the State can demonstrate that “the population deviations in its plan were necessary to achieve some legitimate state objective.” U. S., at . Considering, asKarcherinstructs, “the size of the deviations, the importance of the State’s interests, the consistency with which the plan as a whole reflects those interests, and the availability of alternatives that might substan- tially vindicate those interests,”id.,at , it is clear that West Virginia has carried its burden.As an initial matter, the District Court erred in concluding that improved technology has converted a “minor” variation inKarcherinto a “major” variation today. Nothing about technological advances in redistricting and mapping software has, for example, decreased population variations between a State’s counties. Seeid., at , n. 5. Thus, if a State wishes to maintain whole counties, it will inevitably have population variations between districts reflecting the fact that its districts are composed of un- evenly populated counties. Despite technological advances, a variance of 0.% results in no more (or less) vote dilution today than in , when this Court said that such a minor harm could be justified by legitimate state objectives.Moreover, our cases leave little doubt that avoiding contests between incumbents and not splitting political subdivisions are valid, neutral state districting policies. See,e.g.,id.,at . The majority cited no precedent for requiring legislative findings on the “discrete, numerically precise portion” of the variance attributable to each factor, and we are aware of none.The District Court dismissed the State’s interest in limiting the shift of population between old and new districts as “ham-handed,”id.,at , because the State considered only “discrete bounds of geography,” rather than “ ‘[s]ocial, cultural, racial, ethnic, and economic interests common to the population of the area.’ ”Id.,at (quotingGrahamv.Thornburgh,supra, at ). According to the District Court, that did not qualify as “preserving the cores of prior districts” underKarcher, U. S., at –.Regardless of how to read that language fromKarcher, however, our opinion made clear that its list of possible justifications for population variations was not exclusive. Seeid.,at (“Any number of consistently applied legislative policies might justify some variance, including, for instance, . . .”). The desire to minimize population shifts between districts is clearly a valid, neutral state policy. See,e.g.,Turnerv.Arkansas, F. Supp. , – (ED Ark. ), summarily aff’d, U.S. (). S. B. achieves significantly lower population shifts than the alternative plans—more than four times lower than the closest alternative, and more than times lower than others.None of the alternative plans came close to vindicating all three of the State’s legitimate objectives while achieving a lower variance. All other plans failed to serve at least one objective as well as S. B. does; several were worse with respect to two objectives; and the Perfect Plan failed as to all three of the State’s objectives. See App. to Juris. Statement –. This is not to say that anytime a State must choose between serving an additional le- gitimate objective and achieving a lower variance, it may choose the former. But here, given the small “size of the deviations,” as balanced against “the importance of the State’s interests, the consistency with which the plan as a whole reflects those interests,” and the lack of available “alternatives that might substantially vindicate those in- terests yet approximate population equality more closely,”Karcher,supra,at , S. B. is justified by the State’s legitimate objectives.Because the District Court did not reach plaintiffs’ claims under the West Virginia Constitution and the issue has not been briefed by the parties, we leave it to the District Court to address the remaining claims in the first instance. The judgment of the United States District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered."}

The mandate, which employers must enforce, applies to roughly million workers, covering virtually all employers with at least employees. It requires that covered workers receive a COVID– vaccine, and it pre-empts contrary state laws. The only exception is for workers who obtain a medical test each week at their own expense and on their own time, and also wear a mask each workday. OSHA has never before imposed such a mandate. Nor has Congress. Indeed, although Congress has enacted significant legislation addressing the COVID– pandemic, it has declined to enact any measure similar to what OSHA has promulgated here.Many States, businesses, and nonprofit organizations challenged OSHA’s rule in Courts of Appeals across the country. The Fifth Circuit initially entered a stay. But when the cases were consolidated before the Sixth Circuit, that court lifted the stay and allowed OSHA’s rule to take effect. Applicants now seek emergency relief from this Court, arguing that OSHA’s mandate exceeds its statutory authority and is otherwise unlawful. Agreeing that applicants are likely to prevail, we grant their applications and stay the rule.IACongress enacted the Occupational Safety and Health Act in . Stat. , U. S. C. §651et seq.The Act created the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), which is part of the Department of Labor and under the supervision of its Secretary. As its name suggests, OSHA is tasked with ensuringoccupationalsafety—that is, “safe and healthful working conditions.” §(b). It does so by enforcing occupational safety and health standards promulgated by the Secretary. §(b). Such standards must be “reasonably necessary or appropriate to provide safe or healthfulemployment.” §(8) (emphasis added). They must also be developed using a rigorous process that includes notice, comment, and an opportunity for a public hearing. §(b).The Act contains an exception to those ordinary notice-and-comment procedures for “emergency temporary standards.” §(c)(1). Such standards may “take immediate effect upon publication in the Federal Register.”Ibid.They are permissible, however, only in the narrowest of circumstances: the Secretary must show (1) “that employees are exposed to grave danger from exposure to substances or agents determined to be toxic or physically harmful or from new hazards,” and (2) that the “emergency standard is necessary to protect employees from such danger.”Ibid.Prior to the emergence of COVID–, the Secretary had used this power just nine times before (and never to issue a rule as broad as this one). Of those nine emergency rules, six were challenged in court, and only one of those was upheld in full. SeeBST Holdings, L.L.C.v.Occupational Safety and Health Admin., F. 4th , ( ).BOn September 9, , President Biden announced “a new plan to require more Americans to be vaccinated.” Remarks on the COVID– Response and National Vaccination Efforts, Daily Comp. of Pres. Doc. , p. 2. As part of that plan, the President said that the Department of Labor would issue an emergency rule requiring all employers with at least employees “to ensure their workforces are fully vaccinated or show a negative test at least once a week.”Ibid.The purpose of the rule was to increase vaccination rates at “businesses all across America.”Ibid.In tandem with other planned regulations, the administration’s goal was to impose “vaccine requirements” on “about million Americans, two-thirds of all workers.”Id.,at 3.After a 2-month delay, the Secretary of Labor issued the promised emergency standard. Fed. Reg. (). Consistent with President Biden’s announcement, the rule applies to all who work for employers with or more employees. There are narrow exemptions for employees who work remotely “ percent of the time” or who “work exclusively outdoors,” but those exemptions are largely illusory.Id.,at . The Secretary has estimated, for example, that only nine percent of landscapers and groundskeepers qualify as working exclusively outside.Id.,at . The regulation otherwise operates as a blunt instrument. It draws no distinctions based on industry or risk of exposure to COVID–. Thus, most lifeguards and linemen face the same regulations as do medics and meatpackers. OSHA estimates that .2 million employees are subject to its mandate.Id.,at .Covered employers must “develop, implement, and enforce a mandatory COVID– vaccination policy.”Id., at . The employer must verify the vaccination status of each employee and maintain proof of it.Id., at . The mandate does contain an “exception” for employers that require unvaccinated workers to “undergo [weekly] COVID– testing and wear a face covering at work in lieu of vaccination.”Id., at . But employers are not required to offer this option, and the emergency regulation purports to pre-empt state laws to the contrary.Id.,at . Unvaccinated employees who do not comply with OSHA’s rule must be “removed from the workplace.”Id.,at . And employers who commit violations face hefty fines: up to $, for a standard violation, and up to $, for a willful one. CFR §.(d) ().COSHA published its vaccine mandate on November 5, . Scores of parties—including States, businesses, trade groups, and nonprofit organizations—filed petitions for review, with at least one petition arriving in each regional Court of Appeals. The cases were consolidated in the Sixth Circuit, which was selected at random pursuant to U. S. C. §(a).Prior to consolidation, however, the Fifth Circuit stayed OSHA’s rule pending further judicial review.BST Holdings, F. 4th . It held that the mandate likely exceeded OSHA’s statutory authority, raised separation-of-powers concerns in the absence of a clear delegation from Congress, and was not properly tailored to the risks facing different types of workers and workplaces.When the consolidated cases arrived at the Sixth Circuit, two things happened. First, many of the petitioners—nearly in all—requested initial hearing en banc. Second, OSHA asked the Court of Appeals to vacate the Fifth Circuit’s existing stay. The Sixth Circuit denied the request for initial hearing en banc by an evenly divided 8-to-8 vote.In re MCP No. , F. 4th (). Chief Judge Sutton dissented, joined by seven of his colleagues. He reasoned that the Secretary’s “broad assertions of administrative power demand unmistakable legislative support,” which he found lacking.Id.,at . A three-judge panel then dissolved the Fifth Circuit’s stay, holding that OSHA’s mandate was likely consistent with the agency’s statutory and constitutional authority. SeeIn re MCP No. Judge Larsen dissented.Various parties then filed applications in this Court requesting that we stay OSHA’s emergency standard. We consolidated two of those applications—one from the National Federation of Independent Business, and one from a coalition of States—and heard expedited argument on January 7, .IIThe Sixth Circuit concluded that a stay of the rule was not justified. We disagree.AApplicants are likely to succeed on the merits of their claim that the Secretary lacked authority to impose the mandate. Administrative agencies are creatures of statute. They accordingly possess only the authority that Congress has provided. The Secretary has ordered million Americans to either obtain a COVID– vaccine or undergo weekly medical testing at their own expense. This is no “everyday exercise of federal power.”In re MCP No. , F. 4th, at (Sutton, C. J., dissenting). It is instead a significant encroachment into the lives—and health—of a vast number of employees. “We expect Congress to speak clearly when authorizing an agency to exercise powers of vast economic and political significance.”Alabama Assn. of Realtorsv.Department of Health and Human Servs., U. S., at 6) (internal quotation marks omitted). There can be little doubt that OSHA’s mandate qualifies as an exercise of such authority.The question, then, is whether the Act plainly authorizes the Secretary’s mandate. It does not. The Act empowers the Secretary to setworkplacesafety standards, not broad public health measures. See U. S. C. §(b) (directing the Secretary to set “occupationalsafety and health standards” (emphasis added)); §(c)(1) (authorizing the Secretary to impose emergency temporary standards necessary to protect “employees” from grave danger in the workplace). Confirming the point, the Act’s provisions typically speak to hazards that employees face at work. See,e.g.,§§, , . And no provision of the Act addresses public health more generally, which falls outside of OSHA’s sphere of expertise.The dissent protests that we are imposing “a limit found no place in the governing statute.”Post, at 7 (joint opinion of [REDACTED], [REDACTED], and [REDACTED], JJ.). Not so. It is the text of the agency’s Organic Act that repeatedly makes clear that OSHA is charged with regulating “occupational” hazards and the safety and health of “employees.” See,e.g., U. S. C. §§(8), (a)(2), (b)–(c).The Solicitor General does not dispute that OSHA is limited to regulating “work-related dangers.” Response Brief for OSHA in No. etc., p. (OSHA Response). She instead argues that the risk of contracting COVID– qualifies as such a danger. We cannot agree. Although COVID– is a risk that occurs in many workplaces, it is not anoccupationalhazard in most. COVID– can and does spread at home, in schools, during sporting events, and everywhere else that people gather. That kind of universal risk is no different from the day-to-day dangers that all face from crime, air pollution, or any number of communicable diseases. Permitting OSHA to regulate the hazards of daily life—simply because most Americans have jobs and face those same risks while on the clock—would significantly expand OSHA’s regulatory authority without clear congressional authorization.The dissent contends that OSHA’s mandate is comparable to a fire or sanitation regulation imposed by the agency. Seepost, at 7–9. But a vaccine mandate is strikingly unlike the workplace regulations that OSHA has typically imposed. A vaccination, after all, “cannot be undone at the end of the workday.”In re MCP No. , F. 4th, at (Sutton, C. J., dissenting). Contrary to the dissent’s contention, imposing a vaccine mandate on million Americans in response to a worldwide pandemic is simply not “part of what the agency was built for.”Post, at .That is not to say OSHA lacks authority to regulate occupation-specific risks related to COVID–. Where the virus poses a special danger because of the particular features of an employee’s job or workplace, targeted regulations are plainly permissible. We do not doubt, for example, that OSHA could regulate researchers who work with the COVID– virus. So too could OSHA regulate risks associated with working in particularly crowded or cramped environments. But the danger present in such workplaces differs in both degree and kind from the everyday risk of contracting COVID– that all face. OSHA’s indiscriminate approach fails to account for this crucial distinction—between occupational risk and risk more generally—and accordingly the mandate takes on the character of a general public health measure, rather than an “occupationalsafety or health standard.” U. S. C. §(b) (emphasis added).In looking for legislative support for the vaccine mandate, the dissent turns to the American Rescue Plan Act of , Pub. L. –2, Stat. 4. Seepost, at 8. That legislation, signed into law on March , , of course said nothing about OSHA’s vaccine mandate, which was not announced until six months later. In fact, the most noteworthy action concerning the vaccine mandate by either House of Congress has been a majority vote of the Senate disapproving the regulation on December 8, . S. J. Res. , 117th Cong., 1st Sess. ().It is telling that OSHA, in its half century of existence, has never before adopted a broad public health regulation of this kind—addressing a threat that is untethered, in any causal sense, from the workplace. This “lack of historical precedent,” coupled with the breadth of authority that the Secretary now claims, is a “telling indication” that the mandate extends beyond the agency’s legitimate reach.Free Enterprise Fundv.Public Company Accounting Oversight Bd., U.S. , () (internal quotation marks omitted).[1]BThe equities do not justify withholding interim relief. We are told by the States and the employers that OSHA’s mandate will force them to incur billions of dollars in unrecoverable compliance costs and will cause hundreds of thousands of employees to leave their jobs. See Application in No. , pp. –; Application in No. , pp. –; see also Fed. Reg. . For its part, the Federal Government says that the mandate will save over 6, lives and prevent hundreds of thousands of hospitalizations. OSHA Response ; see also Fed. Reg. .It is not our role to weigh such tradeoffs. In our system of government, that is the responsibility of those chosen by the people through democratic processes. Although Congress has indisputably given OSHA the power to regulate occupational dangers, it has not given that agency the power to regulate public health more broadly. Requiring the vaccination of million Americans, selected simply because they work for employers with more than employees, certainly falls in the latter category.* * *The applications for stays presented to [REDACTED] and by him referred to the Court are granted.OSHA’s COVID– Vaccination and Testing; Emergency Temporary Standard, Fed.

Decided February , 2019Per Curiam.The petition in this case presents the following question: May a federal court count the vote of a judge who dies before the decision is issued?A judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, the Honorable Stephen Reinhardt, died on March , , but the Ninth Circuit counted his vote in cases decided after that date.[1]* In the present case, Judge Reinhardt was listed as the author of an en banc decision issued on April 9, , days after he passed away. By counting Judge Reinhardt’s vote, the court deemed Judge Reinhardt’s opinion to be a majority opinion, which means that it constitutes a precedent that all future Ninth Circuit panels must follow. SeeUnited Statesv.Caperna, F.3d , , n. 2 (). Without Judge Reinhardt’s vote, the opinion attributed to him would have been approved by only 5 of the members of the en banc panel who were still living when the decision was filed.Although the other five living judges concurred in the judgment, they did so for different reasons. The upshot is that Judge Reinhardt’s vote made a difference. Was that lawful?IAileen Rizo, an employee of the Fresno County Office of Education, brought suit against the superintendent of schools, claiming, among other things, that the county was violating the Equal Pay Act of , 77Stat. –, U. S. C. §(d). The District Court denied the county’s motion for summary judgment, and the Ninth Circuit granted the county’s petition for interlocutory review. A three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit vacated the decision of the District Court based on a prior Ninth Circuit decision,Koubav.Allstate Ins. Co., F.2d (), that the panel “believed it was compelled to follow.” F.3d , () (en banc). The court then granted en banc review “to clarify the law, including the vitality and effect ofKouba.”Ibid.Like other courts of appeals, the Ninth Circuit takes the position that a panel decision like that inKoubacan be overruled only by a decision of the en banc court or this Court, seeNarutov.Slater, F.3d , (), and therefore a clear purpose of the en banc decision issued on April 9 was to announce a new binding Ninth Circuit interpretation of the Equal Pay Act issue previously addressed byKouba. The opinion authored by Judge Reinhardt and issued days after his death purports to do that, but its status as a majority opinion of the en banc court depends on counting Judge Reinhardt’s vote.The opinions issued by the en banc Ninth Circuit state that they were “Filed April 9, ,” and they were entered on the court’s docket on that date. A footnote at the beginning of the en banc opinion states:“Prior to his death, Judge Reinhardt fully participated in this case and authored this opinion. The majority opinion and all concurrences were final, and voting was completed by the en banc court prior to his death.” F. 3d, at , n. *.IIThe Ninth Circuit did not expressly explain why it concluded that it could count Judge Reinhardt’s opinion as “[t]he majority opinion” even though it was not endorsed by a majority of the living judges at the time of issuance, but the justification suggested by the footnote noted above is that the votes and opinions in the en banc case were inalterably fixed at least days prior to the date on which the decision was “filed,” entered on the docket, and released to the public. This justification is inconsistent with well-established judicial practice, federal statutory law, and judicial precedent.As for judicial practice, we are not aware of any rule or decision of the Ninth Circuit that renders judges’ votes and opinions immutable at some point in time prior to their public release. And it is generally understood that a judge may change his or her position up to the very moment when a decision is released.We endorsed this rule inUnited Statesv.American-Foreign S. S. Corp., U.S. (), which interpreted an earlier version of U. S. C. §(c), the statutory provision authorizing the courts of appeals to hear cases en banc. The current version of this provision permits a circuit to adopt a rule allowing a senior circuit judge to sit on an en banc case under certain circumstances, but at the time of our decision inAmerican-Foreign S. S. Corp., this was not allowed. Instead, only active judges could sit en banc. See U. S. C. §(c) ( ed.).InAmerican-Foreign S. S. Corp., Judge Harold Medina was one of the five active judges on the Second Circuit when the court granted a petition for rehearing en banc. After briefing was complete but before an opinion issued, Judge Medina took senior status. When the en banc court issued its decision, the majority opinion was joined by Judge Medina and two active Circuit Judges; the two other active Circuit Judges dissented. We vacated the judgment and remanded the case, holding that “[a]n ‘active’ judge is a judge who has not retired ‘from regular active service,’ ” and “[a] case or controversy is ‘determined’ when it is decided.” U. S., at . Because Judge Medina was not in regular active service when the opinion issued, he was “without power to participate” in the en banc decision.Id., at , ; cf., id.,at – (Harlan, J., dissenting).Our holding inAmerican-Foreign S. S. Corp.applies with equal if not greater force here. When the Ninth Circuit issued its opinion in this case, Judge Reinhardt was neither an active judge nor a senior judge. For that reason, by statute he was without power to participate in the en banc court’s decision at the time it was rendered.In addition to §(c), §(d) also shows that what the Ninth Circuit did here was unlawful. That provision states:“A majority of the number of judges authorized to constitute a court or panel thereof, as provided in paragraph (c), shall constitute a quorum.”Under §(c), a court of appeals case may be decided by a panel of three judges, and therefore on such a panel two judges constitute a quorum and are able to decide an appeal—provided, of course, that they agree. Invoking this rule, innumerable court of appeals decisions hold that when one of the judges on a three-judge panel dies, retires, or resigns after an appeal is argued or is submitted for decision without argument, the other two judges on the panel may issue a decision if they agree. See,e.g., United Statesv.Allied Stevedoring Corp., F.2d , ( );Murrayv.National Broadcasting Co., F.3d , ( );Singhv.Ashcroft, Fed. Appx. , , n. ( );ASW Allstate Painting & Constr. Co.v.Lexington Ins. Co., F.3d , , n. ( );Clarkv.Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., F.3d , n. ** ( );Kulumaniv.Blue Cross Blue Shield Assn, F.3d , , n. ** ( ). See alsoNguyenv.United States, U.S. , () (“[S]ettled law permits a quorum to proceed to judgment when one member of the panel dies or is disqualified.”). With the exception of one recent decision issued by the Ninth Circuit after Judge Reinhardt’s death but subsequently withdrawn, seesupra, at 1 n., we are aware of no cases in which a court of appeals panel has purported to issue a binding decision that was joined at the time of release by less than a quorum of the judges who were alive at that time.* * *Because Judge Reinhardt was no longer a judge at the time when the en banc decision in this case was filed, the Ninth Circuit erred in counting him as a member of the majority. That practice effectively allowed a deceased judge to exercise the judicial power of the United States after his death. But federal judges are appointed for life, not for eternity.We therefore grant the petition for certiorari, vacate the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.[REDACTED] concurs in the judgment.*InAltera Corp.v.Commissioner, WL (, July , ), decided four months after Judge Reinhardt died, his vote was initially counted as one of the two judges in the majority. A footnote in the opinion stated: “Judge Reinhardt fully participated in this case and formally concurred in the majority opinion prior to his death.”Id., at *1, n. **. Later, however, the court vacated the opinion and issued an order reconstituting the panel.Altera Corp.v.Commissioner, F.3d ( ). No similar action was taken in this case."}

After listening to each side’s arguments, the trial court denied [REDACTED]’s motion.

With respect to Juror S, [REDACTED] argued that a non-black juror—Juror 8—also had negative experiences with law enforcement but remained on the jury. App. to Pet. for Cert. –. Juror 8 stated during jury selection that he had been stopped while driving in Illinois several years earlier as part of what he believed to be a “scam” by Illinois police targeting drivers with California license plates. Juror 8 also complained that he had been disappointed by the failure of law enforcement officers to investigate the burglary of his car.

The appellate court explained that “[t]he trial court’s ruling on this issue is reviewed for substantial evidence,” App. to Pet. for Cert. (internal quotation marks omitted), which the California courts have characterized as equivalent to the “clear error” standard employed by federal courts, see,e.g.,Peoplev.Alvarez, Cal. 4th , , P. 2d , (). With respect to whether the prosecutor’s stated reasons were pretextual, the court explained that it “give[s] great deference to the trial court’s ability to distinguish bona fide reasons from sham excuses.” App. to Pet. for Cert. .After comparing Juror S to Juror 8, the court concluded that “Juror 8’s negative experience out of state and the car burglary is not comparable to [Juror S’s] years of perceived harassment by law enforcement based in part on race.”Id., at . As for Juror J, the court recognized that the prosecutor’s dismissal was based on her social services background—“a proper race-neutral reason”—and that this explained his different treatment of jurors with “backgrounds in law, bio-chemistry or environmental engineering.” The court also noted that the “prosecutor focused on [Juror J’s] internship experience” at the county jail.Id., at .After the California Supreme Court denied [REDACTED]’s petition for review, [REDACTED] sought federal habeas relief. The Federal District Court properly recognized that review of [REDACTED]’s claim was governed by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of (AEDPA). That law provides, in pertinent part, that federal habeas relief may not be granted unless the state court adjudication “resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.” U. S. C. §(d)(2). After considering the state Court of Appeal decision and reviewing the record evidence, the District Court held that the California Court of Appeal’s findings were not unreasonable.

(). In so doing, the court did not discuss any specific facts or mention the reasoning of the other three courts that had rejected [REDACTED]’s claim. Instead, after setting forth the basic background legal principles in the first two paragraphs, the Court of Appeals offered a one-sentence conclusory explanation for its decision:“The prosecutor’s proffered race-neutral bases for peremptorily striking the two African-American jurors were not sufficient to counter the evidence of purposeful discrimination in light of the fact that two out of three prospective African-American jurors were stricken, and the record reflected different treatment of comparably situated jurors.”Id., at .That decision is as inexplicable as it is unexplained.

(), we held that a state prisoner is entitled to habeas corpus relief if a federal judge finds that “upon the record evidence adduced at the trial no rational trier of fact could have found proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.”Id.,at . A Nevada jury convicted respondent of rape; the evidence presented included DNA evidence matching respondent’s DNA profile. Nevertheless, relying upon a report prepared by a DNA expert over years after the trial, the Federal District Court applied theJacksonstandard and granted the writ. A divided Court of Appeals affirmed.Brownv.Farwell, F. 3d ( ). We granted certiorari to consider whether those courts misappliedJackson.Because the trial record includes both the DNA evidence and other convincing evidence of guilt, we conclude that they clearly did.IAround 1 a.m. on January , , 9-year-old Jane Doe was brutally raped in the bedroom of her trailer. Respondent Troy Brown was convicted of the crime. During and since his trial, respondent has steadfastly maintained his innocence.[Footnote 1] He was, however, admittedly intoxicated when the crime occurred, and after he awoke on the following morning he told a friend “ ‘he wished that he could remember what did go on or what went on.’ ” App. .Troy and his brother Travis resided near Jane Doe in the same trailer park. Their brother Trent and his wife Raquel lived in the park as well, in a trailer across the street from Jane Doe’s. Both Troy and Trent were acquainted with Jane Doe’s family; Troy had visited Jane Doe’s trailer several times. Jane did not know Travis. The evening of the attack, Jane’s mother, Pam, took Jane to Raquel and Trent’s trailer to babysit while the three adults went out for about an hour. Raquel and Trent returned at about 7: p.m. and took Jane home at about 9: p.m. Pam stayed out and ended up drinking and playing pool with Troy at a nearby bar called the Peacock Lounge. Troy knew that Jane and her 4-year-old sister were home alone because he answered the phone at the bar when Jane called for her mother earlier that evening.Troy consumed at least shots of vodka followed by beer chasers, and was so drunk that he vomited on himself while he was walking home after leaving the Peacock at about : a.m. Jane called her mother to report the rape at approximately 1 a.m. Although it would have taken a sober man less than minutes to walk home, Troy did not arrive at his trailer until about 1: a.m. He was wearing dark jeans, a cowboy hat, a black satin jacket, and boots. Two witnesses saw a man dressed in dark jeans, a cowboy hat, and a black satin jacket stumbling in the road between the two trailers shortly after 1 a.m.The bedroom where the rape occurred was dark, and Jane was unable to conclusively identify her assailant. When asked whom he reminded her of, she mentioned both Troy and his brother Trent. Several days after the rape, she identified a man she saw on television (Troy) as her assailant but then stated that the man who had sent flowers attacked her. It was Trent and Raquel who had sent her flowers, not Troy. She was unable to identify Troy as her assailant out of a photo lineup, and she could not identify her assailant at trial. The night of the rape, however, she said her attacker was wearing dark jeans, a black jacket with a zipper, boots, and a watch. She also vividly remembered that the man “stunk real, real bad” of “cologne, or some beer or puke or something.”Id.,at –.Some evidence besides Jane’s inconsistent identification did not inculpate Troy. Jane testified that she thought she had bitten her assailant, but Troy did not have any bite marks on his hands when examined by a police officer approximately four hours after the attack. Jane stated that her assailant’s jacket had a zipper (Troy’s did not) and that he wore a watch (Troy claimed he did not). Additionally, there was conflicting testimony as to when Troy left the Peacock and when Pam received Jane’s call reporting the rape. The witnesses who saw a man stumbling between the two trailers reported a bright green logo on the back of the jacket, but Troy’s jacket had a yellow and orange logo. Finally, because Jane thought she had left a night light on when she went to bed, the police suspected the assailant had turned off the light. The only usable fingerprint taken from the light did not match Troy’s and the police did not find Troy’s fingerprints in the trailer.Other physical evidence, however, pointed to Troy. The police recovered semen from Jane’s underwear and from the rape kit. The State’s expert, Renee Romero, tested the former and determined that the DNA matched Troy’s and that the probability another person from the general population would share the same DNA (the “random match probability”) was only 1 in 3,,. Troy’s counsel did not call his own DNA expert at trial, although he consulted with an expert in advance who found no problems with Romero’s test procedures. At some time before sentencing, Troy’s family had additional DNA testing done. That testing showed semen taken from the rape kit matched Troy’s DNA, with a random match probability of 1 in ,.The jury found Troy guilty of sexual assault and sentenced him to life with the possibility of parole after years.[Footnote 2] On direct appeal, the Nevada Supreme Court considered Troy’s claim that his conviction was not supported by sufficient evidence, analyzing “whether the jury, acting reasonably, could have been convinced of [Troy’s] guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.”Brownv.Nevada, Nev. , , P. 2d , ()(per curiam). The court rejected the claim, summarizing the evidence of guilt as follows:“Testimony indicated that Troy left the bar around : a.m., that Troy lived relatively close to the bar, and that Troy lived very close to Jane Doe. Troy had enough time to get from the bar to Jane Doe’s house and to assault Jane Doe before she made the telephone call to her mother at approximately 1: a.m. While Jane Doe could not identify her assailant, her description of his clothing was similar to what Troy was wearing; she also said that her assailant smelled like beer or vomit and testimony indicated that Troy had been drinking beer and had vomited several times that night. Furthermore, testimony indicated that Troy got home at approximately 1: a.m., which gave him enough time to assault Jane Doe. Additionally, [witnesses] testified that they saw someone resembling Troy in a black jacket and black hat stumbling in the road near Jane Doe’s house at 1: a.m. Troy also washed his pants and shirt when he got home, arguably to remove the blood evidence from his clothes. Finally, the DNA evidence indicated that semen collected from Jane Doe’s underwear matched Troy’s and that only 1 in 3,, other people had matching DNA (the second DNA test indicated that 1 in , people had matching DNA).”Ibid., P. 2d, at –.Respondent also argued on appeal that the trial court erred in failing to conduct a pretrial hearing to determine whether the DNA evidence was reliable. The court found respondent had not raised this issue in the trial court and concluded there was no plain error in the trial court’s failure to conduct a hearing.Id., at , P. 2d, at .In , respondent sought state postconviction relief, claiming,inter alia,that his trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective for failing to object to the admission of the DNA evidence. He argued that there were a number of foundational problems with the DNA evidence, and that if trial counsel had objected, the evidence would have been excluded or at least its importance diminished. He noted that because trial counsel “totally failed to challenge the DNA evidence in the case,” counsel “failed to preserve valid issues for appeal.” App. . The state postconviction court denied relief,id.,at –, and the Nevada Supreme Court affirmed,id.,at –.Respondent thereafter filed this federal habeas petition, claiming there was insufficient evidence to convict him on the sexual assault charges and that the Nevada Supreme Court’s rejection of his claim was both contrary to, and an unreasonable application of,[REDACTED]. He did not bring a typicalJacksonclaim, however. Rather than argue that the totality of the evidence admitted against him at trial was constitutionally insufficient, he argued that some of the evidence should be excluded from theJacksonanalysis. In particular, he argued that Romero’s testimony related to the DNA evidence was inaccurate and unreliable in two primary respects: Romero mischaracterized the random match probability and misstated the probability of a DNA match among his brothers. Absent that testimony, he contended, there was insufficient evidence to convict him.In support of his claim regarding the accuracy of Romero’s testimony, respondent submitted a report prepared by Laurence Mueller, a professor in ecology and evolutionary biology (Mueller Report). The District Court supplemented the record with the Mueller Report, even though it was not presented to any state court, because “the thesis of the report was argued during post-conviction.”Brownv.Farwell, No. 3:–cv––PMP–VPC, WL , *5, n. 2 (Nev., Dec. , ).Relying upon the Mueller Report, the District Court set aside the “unreliable DNA testimony” and held that without the DNA evidence “a reasonable doubt would exist in the mind of any rational trier of fact.”Id., at *7. The court granted respondent habeas relief on hisJacksonclaim.[Footnote 3]The Ninth Circuit affirmed. F. 3d . The court held the Nevada Supreme Court had unreasonably appliedJackson. F. 3d, at ; see U. S. C. §(d)(1). The Court of Appeals first reasoned “the admission of Romero’s unreliable and misleading testimony violated Troy’s due process rights,” so the District Court was correct to exclude it. F. 3d, at . It then “weighed the sufficiency of the remaining evidence,” including the District Court’s “catalogu[e] [of] the numerous inconsistencies that would raise a reasonable doubt as to Troy’s guilt in the mind of any rational juror.”Ibid. In light of the “stark” conflicts in the evidence and the State’s concession that there was insufficient evidence absent the DNA evidence, the court held it was objectively unreasonable for the Nevada Supreme Court to reject respondent’s insufficiency-of-the-evidence claim.Id., at .We granted certiorari, U. S.IIRespondent’s claim has now crystallized into a claim about the import of two specific inaccuracies in the testimony related to the DNA evidence, as indicated by the Mueller Report. The Mueller Report does not challenge Romero’s qualifications as an expert or the validity of any of the tests that she performed. Mueller instead contends that Romero committed the so-called “prosecutor’s fallacy” and that she underestimated the probability of a DNA match between respondent and one of his brothers.The prosecutor’s fallacy is the assumption that the random match probability is the same as the probability that the defendant was not the source of the DNA sample. See Nat. Research Council, Comm. on DNA Forensic Science, The Evaluation of Forensic DNA Evidence () (“Let P equal the probability of a match, given the evidence genotype. The fallacy is to say that P is also the probability that the DNA at the crime scene came from someone other than the defendant”). In other words, if a juror is told the probability a member of the general population would share the same DNA is 1 in , (random match probability), and he takes that to mean there is only a 1 in , chance that someone other than the defendant is the source of the DNA found at the crime scene (source probability), then he has succumbed to the prosecutor’s fallacy. It is further error to equate source probability with probability of guilt, unless there is no explanation other than guilt for a person to be the source of crime-scene DNA. This faulty reasoning may result in an erroneous statement that, based on a random match probability of 1 in ,, there is a .% chance the defendant is innocent or a .% chance the defendant is guilty.The Mueller Report does not dispute Romero’s opinion that only 1 in 3,, people would have the same DNA profile as the rapist. Mueller correctly points out, however, that some of Romero’s testimony—as well as the prosecutor’s argument—suggested that the evidence also established that there was only a .% chance that respondent was innocent. The State concedes as much. Brief for Petitioners . For example, the prosecutor argued at closing the jury could be “. percent sure” in this case. App. . And when the prosecutor asked Romero, in a classic example of erroneously equating source probability with random match probability, whether “it [would] be fair to say ... that the chances that the DNA found in the panties—the semen in the panties—and the blood sample, the likelihood that it is not Troy Brown would be .,”id.,at , Romero ultimately agreed that it was “not inaccurate” to state it that way,id.,at –.Looking at Romero’s testimony as a whole, though, she also indicated that she was merely accepting the mathematical equivalence between 1 in 3,, and the percentage figure. At the end of the colloquy about percentages, she answered affirmatively the court’s question whether the percentage was “the same math just expressed differently.”Id.,at . She pointed out that the probability a brother would match was greater than the random match probability, which also indicated to the jury that the random match probability is not the same as the likelihood that someone other than Troy was the source of the DNA.The Mueller Report identifies a second error in Romero’s testimony: her estimate of the probability that one or more of Troy’s brothers’ DNA would match. Romero testified there was a 1 in 6, (or .%) probability that one brother would share the same DNA with another.Id.,at , . When asked whether “that change[s] at all with two brothers,” she answered no.Id.,at . According to Mueller, Romero’s analysis was misleading in two respects. First, she used an assumption regarding the parents under which siblings have the lowest chance of matching that is biologically possible, but even under this stingy assumption she reported the chance of two brothers matching (1 in 6,) as much lower than it is (1 in 1, under her assumption). Second, using the assumptions Mueller finds more appropriate, the probability of a single sibling matching respondent is 1 in , the probability that among two brothers one or more would match is 1 in , and among four brothers it is 1 in .Id.,at .In sum, the two inaccuracies upon which this case turns are testimony equating random match probability with source probability, and an underestimate of the likelihood that one of Troy’s brothers would also match the DNA left at the scene.IIIAlthough we granted certiorari to review respondent’sJacksonclaim, the parties now agree that the Court of Appeals’ resolution of his claim underJacksonwas in error. See Brief for Respondent 2–3; Reply Brief for Petitioners 1. Indeed, respondent argues the Court of Appeals did not decide his case underJacksonat all, but instead resolved the question whether admission of Romero’s inaccurate testimony rendered his trial fundamentally unfair and then appliedJacksonto determine whether that error was harmless.Although both petitioners and respondent are now aligned on the same side of the questions presented for our review, the case is not moot because “the parties continue to seek different relief” from this Court.Pacific Bell Telephone Co.v.linkLine Communications, Inc., U. S., at 6). Respondent primarily argues that we affirm on his proposed alternative ground or remand to the Ninth Circuit for analysis of his due process claim under the standard for harmless error ofBrechtv.Abrahamson, U. S. (). The State, on the other hand, asks us to reverse. Respondent and oneamicushave also suggested that we dismiss the case as improvidently granted, Brief for National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers asAmicus –, but we think prudential concerns favor our review of the Court of Appeals’ application ofJackson. Cf., at 7).Respondent no longer argues it was proper for the District Court to admit the Mueller Report for the purpose of evaluating hisJacksonclaim, Brief for Respondent , and concedes the “purpose of aJacksonanalysis is to determine whether the jury acted in a rational manner in returning a guilty verdict based on the evidence before it, not whether improper evidence violated due process,”id.,at 2. There has been no suggestion that the evidence adduced at trial was insufficient to convict unless some of it was excluded. Respondent’s concession thus disposes of hisJacksonclaim. The concession is also clearly correct. An “appellate court’s reversal for insufficiency of the evidence is in effect a determination that the government’s case against the defendant was so lacking that the trial court should have entered a judgment of acquittal.”Lockhartv.Nelson, U. S. , (). Because reversal for insufficiency of the evidence is equivalent to a judgment of acquittal, such a reversal bars a retrial. SeeBurksv.United States, U. S. 1, (). To “make the analogy complete” between a reversal for insufficiency of the evidence and the trial court’s granting a judgment of acquittal,Lockhart, U. S., at , “a reviewing court must consider all of the evidence admitted by the trial court,” regardless whether that evidence was admitted erroneously,id., at .Respondent therefore correctly concedes that a reviewing court must consider all of the evidence admitted at trial when considering aJacksonclaim. Even if we set that concession aside, however, and assume that the Court of Appeals could have considered the Mueller Report in the context of aJacksonclaim, the court made an egregious error in concluding the Nevada Supreme Court’s rejection of respondent’s insufficiency-of-the-evidence claim “involved an unreasonable application of ... clearly established Federal law,” U. S. C. §(d)(1).[Footnote 4]Even if the Court of Appeals could have considered it, the Mueller Report provided no warrant for entirely excluding the DNA evidence or Romero’s testimony from that court’s consideration. The Report did not contest that the DNA evidence matched Troy. That DNA evidence remains powerful inculpatory evidence even though the State concedes Romero overstated its probative value by failing to dispel the prosecutor’s fallacy. And Mueller’s claim that Romero used faulty assumptions and underestimated the probability of a DNA match between brothers indicates that two experts do not agree with one another, not that Romero’s estimates were unreliable.[Footnote 5]Mueller’s opinion that “the chance that among four brothers one or more would match is 1 in ,” App. , is substantially different from Romero’s estimate of a 1 in 6, chance that one brother would match. But even if Romero’s estimate is wrong, our confidence in the jury verdict is not undermined. First, the estimate that is more pertinent to this case is 1 in —the probability of a match among two brothers—because two of Troy’s four brothers lived in Utah. Second, although Jane Doe mentioned Trent as her assailant, and Travis lived in a nearby trailer, the evidence indicates that both (unlike Troy) were sober and went to bed early on the night of the crime. Even under Mueller’s odds, a rational jury could consider the DNA evidence to be powerful evidence of guilt.Furthermore, the Court of Appeals’ discussion of the non-DNA evidence departed from the deferential review thatJacksonand §(d)(1) demand. A federal habeas court can only set aside a state-court decision as “an unreasonable application of ... clearly established Federal law,” §(d)(1), if the state court’s application of that law is “objectively unreasonable,”Williamsv.Taylor, U. S. , (). AndJacksonrequires a reviewing court to review the evidence “in the light most favorable to the prosecution.” U. S., at . Expressed more fully, this means a reviewing court “faced with a record of historical facts that supports conflicting inferences must presume—even if it does not affirmatively appear in the record—that the trier of fact resolved any such conflicts in favor of the prosecution, and must defer to that resolution.”Id., at ; see alsoSchlupv.Delo, U. S. , () (“TheJacksonstandard ... looks to whether there is sufficient evidence which, if credited, could support the conviction”). The Court of Appeals acknowledged that it must review the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, but the court’s recitation of inconsistencies in the testimony shows it failed to do that.For example, the court highlights conflicting testimony regarding when Troy left the Peacock. F. 3d, at . It is true that if a juror were to accept the testimony of one bartender that Troy left the bar at 1: a.m., then Troy would have left the bar after the attack occurred. Yet the jury could have credited a different bartender’s testimony that Troy left the Peacock at around : a.m. Resolving the conflict in favor of the prosecution, the jury must have found that Troy left the bar in time to be the assailant. It is undisputed that Troy washed his clothes immediately upon returning home. The court notes this is “plausibly consistent with him being the assailant” but also that he provided an alternative reason for washing his clothes.Ibid.Viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution, the evidence supports an inference that Troy washed the clothes immediately to clean blood from them.To be sure, the court’sJacksonanalysis relied substantially upon a concession made by the State in state postconviction proceedings that “absent the DNA findings, there was insufficient evidence to convict [Troy] of the crime.” App. . But that concession posited a situation in which there was no DNA evidence at all,[Footnote 6] not a situation in which some pieces of testimony regarding the DNA evidence were called into question. In sum, the Court of Appeals’ analysis failed to preserve “the factfinder’s role as weigher of the evidence” by reviewing “all of the evidence... in the light most favorable to the prosecution,”[REDACTED],supra, at , and it further erred in finding that the Nevada Supreme Court’s resolution of theJacksonclaim was objectively unreasonable.IVResolution of theJacksonclaim does not end our consideration of this case because respondent asks us to affirm on an alternative ground. He contends the two errors “in describing the statistical meaning” of the DNA evidence rendered his trial fundamentally unfair and denied him due process of law. Brief for Respondent 4. Because the Ninth Circuit held that “the admission of Romero’s unreliable and misleading testimony violated [respondent’s] due process rights,” F. 3d, at , and in respondent’s view merely appliedJackson(erroneously) to determine whether that error was harmless, he asks us to affirm the judgment below on the basis of what he calls his “DNA due process” claim, Brief for Respondent .As respondent acknowledges, in order to prevail on this claim, he would have to show that the state court’s adjudication of the claim was “contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law.” U. S. C. §(d)(1). The clearly established law he points us to isMansonv.Brathwaite, U. S. , (), in which we held that when the police have used a suggestive eyewitness identification procedure, “reliability is the linchpin in determining” whether an eyewitness identification may be admissible, with reliability determined according to factors set out inNeilv.Biggers, U. S. (). Respondent argues that the admission of the inaccurate DNA testimony violatedBrathwaitebecause the testimony was “identification testimony,” U. S., at , was “unnecessarily suggestive,”id., at , and was unreliable.Respondent has forfeited this claim, which he makes for the very first time in his brief on the merits in this Court. Respondent did not present his new “DNA due process” claim in his federal habeas petition, but instead consistently argued that Romero’s testimony should be excluded from theJacksonanalysis simply because it was “unreliable” and that the due process violation occurred because the remaining evidence was insufficient to convict. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 157a (“[Respondent] asserts ... that the DNA evidence was unreliable and should not have been admitted at his trial. If so, then, ... the state presented insufficient evidence at trial to prove [respondent] guilty”). In the Ninth Circuit, too, respondent presented only hisJacksonclaim,[Footnote 7] and it is, at the least, unclear whether respondent presented his newly minted due process claim in the state courts.[Footnote 8] Recognizing that hisJacksonclaim cannot prevail, respondent tries to rewrite his federal habeas petition. His attempt comes too late, however, and he cannot now start over.* * *We have stated before that “DNA testing can provide powerful new evidence unlike anything known before.”District Attorney’s Office for Third Judicial Dist.v.Osborne, U. S., at 8). Given the persuasiveness of such evidence in the eyes of the jury, it is important that it be presented in a fair and reliable manner. The State acknowledges that Romero committed the prosecutor’s fallacy, Brief for Petitioners , and the Mueller Report suggests that Romero’s testimony may have been inaccurate regarding the likelihood of a match with one of respondent’s brothers. Regardless, ample DNA and non-DNA evidence in the record adduced at trial supported the jury’s guilty verdict underJackson, and we reject respondent’s last minute attempt to recast his claim underBrathwaite. The Court of Appeals did not consider, however, the ineffective-assistance claims on which the District Court also granted respondent habeas relief. Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.Footnote 1He denied involvement when a police officer claimed (wrongly) that the police had found his fingerprints in Jane’s bedroom, and he even denied involvement when the sentencing judge told him that acceptance of responsibility would garner him leniency.Footnote 2Under Nevada law at the time of the trial, the jury, rather than the judge, imposed the sentence for a sexual assault crime if it found the assault resulted in substantial bodily harm. Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. §.(3) (Michie ). For an assault resulting in substantial bodily harm, the jury had the option of sentencing Troy to life without the possibility of parole or to life with eligibility for parole after years. §.(2)(a). The jury elected the more lenient sentence. The judge sentenced Troy to life with the possibility of parole after years on a second count of sexual assault, to run consecutively. The Nevada Supreme Court reversed Troy’s conviction for one count of child abuse on double jeopardy grounds, and ordered resentencing on the second sexual assault count. Brownv.Nevada, Nev. , P. 2d ()(per curiam). On resentencing, the judge imposed the same sentence as before.Footnote 3The District Court also granted habeas relief on respondent’s claim that he was denied effective assistance of counsel with respect to his attorney’s handling of the DNA evidence and failure to adequately investigate the victim’s stepfather as an alternative suspect.Brownv.Farwell, No. 3:–cv––PMP–VPC, WL , *9–* (Nev., Dec. , ). The Court of Appeals did not consider those claims on appeal and they are not now before us.Footnote 4The Court of Appeals also clearly erred in concluding the Nevada Supreme Court’s decision was “contrary to”[REDACTED]. The Court of Appeals held the Nevada Supreme Court’s decision was “contrary to”Jacksonbecause the Nevada court stated a standard that turns on a “reasonable” jury, not a “rational” one, and that assesses whether the jury could have been convinced of a defendant’s guilt, rather than whether it could have been convinced of each element of the crime.Brownv.Farwell, F. 3d , – ( ). It is of little moment that the Nevada Supreme Court analyzed whether a “reasonable” jury could be convinced of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, rather than asking whether a “rational” one could be convinced of each element of guilt; areasonablejury could hardly be convinced of guilt unless it found each element satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt.Footnote 5The State has called our attention to cases in which courts have criticized opinions rendered by Professor Mueller in the past. See Brief for Petitioners –. We need not pass on the relative credibility of the two experts because even assuming that Mueller’s estimate is correct, respondent’s claim fails.Footnote 6The concession was made in the context of proceedings in which respondent argued that competent counsel would have objected to the admissibility of the DNA evidence on a number of grounds—including Romero’s qualifications, chain-of-custody problems, and failure to follow the proper testing protocol—and might have successfully excluded the DNA evidence altogether. See App. –.Footnote 7The Court of Appeals did reason that Romero’s testimony must be excluded from theJacksonanalysis on due process grounds. F. 3d, at . But that decision was inextricably intertwined with the claim respondent did make in his federal habeas petition underJackson. It is clear the Ninth Circuit was never asked to consider—and did not pass upon—the question whether the Nevada Supreme Court entered a decision on direct appeal that was contrary to or an unreasonable application ofMansonv.Brathwaite, U. S. (), or any other clearly established law regarding due process other thanJackson.Footnote 8The State contends the claim is either not exhausted or procedurally defaulted. The State has objected from the beginning that respondent did not raise a due process claim regarding the reliability of the DNA evidence in state court. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 182a–183a. Respondent consistently answered the State’s exhaustion objection by arguing he presented hisJacksonclaim in the Nevada Supreme Court. See App. –. The Ninth Circuit held respondent exhausted hisinsufficiencyclaim. F. 3d, at . The court had no occasion to consider whether respondent exhausted any due process claim other than hisJacksonclaim."}
{"file_name": "per curiam_2011_1_565.json", "author": "per curiam", "year": 2011, "text": "–. Decided October , 2011Per Curiam.The opinion of the Court inJacksonv.Virginia, U.S. (), makes clear that it is the responsibility of the jury—not the court—to decide what conclusions should be drawn from evidence admitted at trial. A reviewing court may set aside the jury’s verdict on the ground of insufficient evidence only if no rational trier of fact could have agreed with the jury. What is more, a federal court may not overturn a state court decision rejecting a suf-ficiency of the evidence challenge simply because the fed-eral court disagrees with the state court. The federal court instead may do so only if the state court decision was “objectively unreasonable.”Renicov.Lett, U. S., at 5) (internal quotation marks omitted).Because rational people can sometimes disagree, the inevitable consequence of this settled law is that judges will sometimes encounter convictions that they believe to be mistaken, but that they must nonetheless uphold. The Court of Appeals in this case substituted its judgment for that of a California jury on the question whether the prosecution’s or the defense’s expert witnesses more persuasively explained the cause of a death. For this reason, certiorari is granted and the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.* * *This case concerns the death of 7-week-old Etzel Glass. On November , , Etzel’s mother, Tomeka, put Etzel to sleep on a sofa before going to sleep herself in another room. Respondent Shirley Ree Smith—Tomeka’s mother—slept on the floor next to Etzel. Several hours later, Smith ran into Tomeka’s room, holding Etzel, who was limp, and told her that “[s]omething [was] wrong with Etzel.” Tr. . By the time emergency officials arrived, Etzel was not breathing and had no heartbeat. Smith reported that she thought Etzel had fallen off the sofa. The officials’ efforts to resuscitate Etzel failed.Doctors initially attributed Etzel’s death to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), the customary diagnosis when an infant shows no outward signs of trauma. But after an autopsy, the coroner concluded that the cause of death was instead shaken baby syndrome (SBS). When a social worker informed Smith of that finding, Smith told her that Etzel had not responded to her touch while sleeping, so she had picked him up and given him “a little shake, a jostle” to wake him.Id., at . According to the social worker, Smith then said something to the effect of, “Oh, my God. Did I do it? Did I do it? Oh, my God.”Id., at (internal quotation marks omitted). In an interview with the police a few days later, Smith said that she had shaken Etzel, but then she corrected herself and said that she had twisted him to try to elicit a reaction. Smith was arrested and charged with assault on a child resulting in death. See Cal. Penal Code Ann. §273ab (West ) (“Any person who, having the care or custody of a child who is under eight years of age, assaults the child by means of force that to a reasonable person would be likely to produce great bodily injury, resulting in the child’s death, shall be punished by imprisonment . . .”).At trial, the jury heard seven days of expert medical testimony on the cause of Etzel’s death. The prosecution offered three experts, each of whom attested that Etzel’s death was the result of SBS—not SIDS, as the defense contended. The first expert, Dr. Eugene Carpenter, was the medical examiner for the Los Angeles County Coroner who had supervised Etzel’s autopsy. Dr. Carpenter is board certified in forensic, anatomic, and clinical pathol-ogy. He testified that Etzel’s autopsy revealed recent hem-orrhages in the brain, and he opined that the bleeding and other features of Etzel’s pathology, including a bruise and abrasion on the lower back of the baby’s head, were consistent with violent shaking. Dr. Carpenter identified two means by which shaking can result in a baby’s death: The first is that the shaking causes blood vessels in the brain to tear, creating a pool of blood that pushes the brain downward into the spinal canal, resulting in death but little direct damage to the brain. The second is that the shaking itself is sufficiently severe that the brain directly tears in vital areas, causing death with very little bleeding. Dr. Carpenter testified that Etzel’s injuries were consistent with the latter pathology. He also explained that the injuries could not be attributed to either a fall from the sofa or the administration of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Nor, according to Dr. Carpenter, was it possible that Etzel perished from SIDS, given the signs of internal trauma. Dr. Carpenter did testify, however, that while SBS victims often suffer retinal hemorrhaging, Etzel’s autopsy revealed no such injury.The prosecution’s second expert, Dr. Stephanie Erlich, was the associate deputy medical examiner who actually performed Etzel’s autopsy. She is board certified in anatomic pathology and neuropathology. She corroborated Dr. Carpenter’s testimony about the autopsy findings, and added that a followup neuropathological examination of Etzel’s brain confirmed the existence of recent hemorrhaging. Noting only a minimal amount of new blood in Etzel’s brain, she testified that the cause of death was direct trauma to the brainstem. On cross-examination, she agreed with defense counsel that retinal hemorrhaging (absent in Etzel’s case) is present in to percent of SBS cases.The third prosecution expert, Dr. David Chadwick, is board certified in pediatrics and the author of articles on childhood death by abusive trauma. He testified that Etzel’s injuries were consistent with SBS and that old trauma could not have been the cause of the child’s death.The defense called two experts to dispute these conclusions. The first, pathologist Dr. Richard Siegler, testified that Etzel died from brain trauma, but that it was not the result of SBS, given the lack of retinal hemorrhaging. He admitted on cross-examination, however, that an absence of retinal hemorrhaging does not exclude a finding of SBS. He also acknowledged that he did not believe the cause of Etzel’s death was SIDS. According to Dr. Siegler, Etzel died from old trauma, an opinion he reached on the basis of studying photographs of the neuropathological examination.The other defense expert, pediatric neurologist Dr. William Goldie, testified that Etzel’s deathwasdue to SIDS. He noted that Etzel was born with jaundice, a heart murmur, and low birth weight—making him more susceptible to SIDS. Dr. Goldie testified that pathologists had not been able to determine the cause of Etzel’s death and that the bleeding could be attributed to the resuscitation efforts.The jury found Smith guilty. Concluding that the jury “carefully weighed” the “tremendous amount of evidence” supporting the verdict, Tr. , the trial judge denied Smith’s motion for a new trial and sentenced her to an indeterminate term of years to life in prison.On direct review, Smith contended that the evidence was not sufficient to establish that Etzel died from SBS. After thoroughly reviewing the competing medical testimony, the California Court of Appeal rejected this claim, concluding:“The expert opinion evidence we have summarized was conflicting. It was for the jury to resolve the conflicts. The credited evidence was substantial and sufficient to support the jury’s conclusions that Etzel died from shaken baby syndrome. The conviction is supported by substantial evidence.”Peoplev.Smith, No. (Feb. , ), App. K to Pet. for Cert. .The California Supreme Court denied review. App. J,id., at .Smith then filed this petition for a writ of habeas corpus with the United States District Court for the Central District of California, renewing her claim that the evidence was insufficient to prove that Etzel died of stocktickerSBS. Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of (AEDPA), 110Stat. , that court had no power to afford relief unless Smith could show either that the California Court of Appeal’s decision affirming the conviction “was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of,” clearly established federal law as reflected in the holdings of this Court’s cases, U. S. C. §(d)(1), or that it “was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts” in light of the state court record, §(d)(2).Harringtonv.Richter, U. S., at ).The Magistrate Judge to whom the case was assigned issued a report acknowledging that “[t]his is not the typical shaken baby case” and that the evidence against Smith “raises many questions.” App. I to Pet. for Cert. . But the Magistrate Judge nevertheless concluded that the evidence was “clearly sufficient to support a conviction.”Ibid.The District Court adopted the Magistrate Judge’s report and denied the petition. App. G,id., at .On appeal, the Ninth Circuit reversed with instructions to grant the writ.Smithv.Mitchell, F.3d (). Despite the plentitude of expert testimony in the trial record concluding that sudden shearing or tearing of the brainstem was the cause of Etzel’s death, the Ninth Circuit determined that there was “no evidence to permit an expert conclusion one way or the other” on that question because there was “no physical evidence of . . . tearing or shearing, and no other evidence supporting death by violent shaking.”Id., at . The court said that the State’s experts “reached [their] conclusion becausethere was no evidence in the brain itself of the cause of death.”Ibid.(emphasis in original). The court concluded that because “[a]bsence of evidence cannot constitute proof beyond a reasonable doubt,”ibid., the California Court of Appeal had “unreasonably applied” this Court’s opinion inJacksonv.Virginiain upholding Smith’s conviction, F. 3d, at .That conclusion was plainly wrong.Jacksonsays that evidence is sufficient to support a conviction so long as “after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution,anyrational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.” U. S., at . It also unambiguously instructs that a reviewing court “faced with a record of historical facts that supports conflicting inferences must presume—even if it does not affirmatively appear in the record—that the trier of fact resolved any such conflicts in favor of the prosecution, and must defer to that resolution.”Id., at . When the deference to state court decisions required by §(d) is applied to the state court’s already deferential review, seeRenico, U. S., at ), there can be no doubt of the Ninth Circuit’s error below.The jury was presented with competing views of how Etzel died. It was made aware of the various experts’ qualifications and their familiarity with both the subject of SBS and the physical condition of Etzel’s body. It observed the attorneys for each party cross-examine the experts and elicit concessions from them. The State’s experts, whom the jury was entitled to believe, opined that the physical evidence was consistent with, and best explained by, death from sudden tearing of the brainstem caused by shaking. The Ninth Circuit’s assertion that these experts “reached [their] conclusion because there was no evidence in the brain itself of the cause of death” is simply false. Therewas“evidence in the brain itself.” The autopsy revealed indications of recent trauma to Etzel’s brain, such as subdural and subarachnoid hemorrhaging, hemorrhaging around the optic nerves, and the presence of a blood clot between the brain’s hemispheres. The autopsy also revealed a bruise and abrasion on the lower back of Etzel’s head. These affirmative indications of trauma formed the basis of the experts’ opinion that Etzel died from shaking so severe that his brainstem tore.Defense counsel made certain that the jury understood that the prosecution’s experts were unable to identify the precise point of tearing itself. But as Judge Bea noted in his dissent from the Ninth Circuit’s denial of rehearing en banc, the experts explained why the location of the tear was undetectable: “Etzel’s death happened so quickly that the effects of the trauma did not have time to develop.”Smithv.Mitchell, F.3d , (). According to the prosecutions’ experts, there was simply no opportunity for swelling to occur around the brainstem before Etzel died.In light of the evidence presented at trial, the Ninth Circuit plainly erred in concluding that the jury’s ver- dict was irrational, let alone that it was unreasonable for the California Court of Appeal to think otherwise. See §(d). Doubts about whether Smith is in fact guilty are understandable. But it is not the job of this Court, and was not that of the Ninth Circuit, to decide whether the State’s theory was correct. The jury decided that question, and its decision is supported by the record.[1]It is said that Smith, who already has served years in prison, has been punished enough, and that she poses no danger to society. These or other considerations perhaps would be grounds to seek clemency, a prerogative granted to executive authorities to help ensure that justice is tempered by mercy. It is not clear to the Court whether this process has been invoked, or, if so, what its course has been. It is not for the Judicial Branch to determine the standards for this discretion. If the clemency power is exercised in either too generous or too stingy a way, that calls for political correctives, not judicial intervention.The decision below cannot be allowed to stand. This Court vacated and remanded this judgment twice before, calling the panel’s attention to this Court’s opinions highlighting the necessity of deference to state courts in §(d) habeas cases. Each time the panel persisted in its course, reinstating its judgment without seriously confronting the significance of the cases called to its attention. SeePatrickv.Smith, country-regionU. S. (vacating and remanding in light ofCareyv.Musladin, country-regionU. S. ()), reinstated on remand, F.3d ()(per curiam); U. S.Brown, placecountry-regionU. S.Smithv.Mitchell, F.3d ()(per curiam). Its refusal to do so necessitates this Court’s action today.The petition for a writ of certiorari and respondent’s motion to proceedin forma pauperisare granted. The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.Notes1The dissent’s review of the evidence presented to the jury over seven days is precisely the sort of reweighing of facts that is precluded byJacksonv.Virginia, U.S. , (), and precisely the sort of second-guessing of a state court decision applyingJacksonthat is precluded by AEDPA, §(d). The dissent’s views on how “adamantly” experts would testify today as opposed to at the time of trial,post, at 6 (opinion of [REDACTED], J.), are of course pure speculation, as would be any views on how a jury would react to less adamant testimony."}

Decided May , 2012Per Curiam.Respondent Lorenzo Johnson was convicted as an accomplice and co-conspirator in the murder of Taraja Williams, who was killed by a shotgun blast to the chest in the early morning hours of December , , in Har- risburg, Pennsylvania. After his conviction was affirmed in state court, Johnson exhausted his state remedies and sought a writ of habeas corpus in Federal District Court pursuant to the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of (AEDPA), U. S. C. §. The District Court denied habeas relief but the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed, holding that the evidence at trial was insufficient to support Johnson’s conviction under the standard set forth inJacksonv. Virginia, U.S. ().We have made clear thatJacksonclaims face a high bar in federal habeas proceedings because they are subject to two layers of judicial deference. First, on direct appeal, “it is the responsibility of the jury—not the court—to decide what conclusions should be drawn from evidence admitted at trial. A reviewing court may set aside the jury’s verdict on the ground of insufficient evidence only if no rational trier of fact could have agreed with the jury.”Cavazosv. Smith, U.S., at 1). And second, on habeas review, “a federal court may not overturn a state court decision rejecting a sufficiency of the evidence challenge simply because the federal court disagrees with the state court. The federal court instead may do so only if the state court decision was ‘objectively unreasonable.’ ”Ibid.(quotingRenicov. Lett, U. S., at 5)).Because the Court of Appeals failed to afford due respect to the role of the jury and the state courts of Pennsylvania, we now grant certiorari and reverse the judgment below.* * *The parties agree that Williams was shot and killed by Corey Walker, who was subsequently convicted of first-degree murder. Johnson was with Walker on the night of the crime, and the two were tried jointly. Johnson was charged as an accomplice and co-conspirator. See Pa. Cons. Stat. § () (defining first-degree murder as “willful, deliberate and premeditated” killing); §(c) (imposing accomplice liability for anyone who, “with the intent of promoting or facilitating the commission of the offense . . . aids or agrees or attempts to aid such other person in planning or committing it”);Commonwealthv. Montalvo, Pa. , , A.2d , () (criminal conspiracy liability for anyone who takes an overt act in furtherance of a crime he has agreed to abet or commit).At trial, the Commonwealth called Victoria Doubs, who testified that she, Johnson, and Walker were “close friends” who “ran the streets together.” Tr. . On the morning of December , the three of them awoke at the same residence, bought marijuana, and then went to a Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant, where they encountered Williams. Walker announced that he was going to “holler at” Williams about a debt Williams owed.Id., at . According to Doubs, Walker and Williams “were talking about the money that [Williams] had owed us,” with Walker “asking [Williams], confronting him, about his money and what’s up with the money and why is it taking you so long to give us the money.”Id., at –. Williams was “cussing [Walker] out, telling him he’d give it to him when he felt like it and he ain’t scared of [Walker].”Id., at . A fight ensued, which ended when Williams beat Walker with a broomstick in front of the crowd of people that had gathered.After the fight, Doubs testified, Walker “was mad, because he got beat by a crackhead. . . . He was saying, yo, that crackhead beat me. I’m going to kill that crackhead. I’m going to kill that kid. . . . He was hot. He was heated.”Id., at –. Johnson was present when Walker made these statements. Later that afternoon, Doubs recounted the beating to others, who laughed at Walker. Walker “repeated it for a while that I’m going to kill that kid. That kid must think I’m some type of joke. I’m going to kill that kid. Who he think he is[?]”Id., at . Once again, Johnson was present for these statements.Another witness was Carla Brown, a friend of the victim, who testified that she was at the Midnight Special Bar on the night of December –, where she saw Walker, Johnson, and Williams engaged in a heated argument. Although she could not hear what they were saying, she could tell they were arguing because they were making “a lot of arm movements.”Id.,at . The bouncer soon told them to leave, and Brown followed them into the street because she “wanted to know what was going on.”Ibid.Brown observed the three men walking in a single-file line, with Walker in front, Williams in the middle, and Johnson in the back. Walker was wearing a long leather coat, walking as if he had something concealed underneath it. Brown followed the three men to an alleyway, at which point Williams recognized Brown and told her to “go ahead” and pass.Id.,at . Walker then entered the alleyway, followed by Williams, while Johnson remained standing at the entrance. As Brown walked past the alley, she heard a loud “boom,” causing her to run away.Id.,at . On cross-examination, Brown stated: “They walked [Williams] in that alley. He stood inside the alley. He walked him in the alley. I heard a boom.”Ibid.The Commonwealth also called Aaron Dews, who testified that he was in a building bordering the alleyway at : a.m. on the morning of December . He heard a loud boom that caused him to look out into the alley from his second-story window, where he saw two silhouettes fleeing.After Dews the Commonwealth called Brian Ramsey, who had been selling cocaine on a nearby street corner at the time of the murder. He testified that he saw Williams walking toward an alleyway with two males and a female, and he heard a loud boom shortly after Williams entered the alley. When pressed on cross-examination, he stated: “I would say that [Williams] was forced in that alley.”Id.,at .The jury also heard testimony from police who searched the alley shortly after the murder and found a shotgun with the barrel missing. A medical examiner who examined Williams’ body testified that the cause of death was a shotgun wound to the chest.After the jury convicted Johnson, he filed a post-trial motion arguing that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction. The court denied his motion, and the Pennsylvania Superior Court affirmed the conviction on direct appeal. SeeCommonwealthv. Johnson, A.2d (). After the Pennsylvania Supreme Court denied his petition for review, Johnson unsuccessfully sought state postconviction relief. He then filed a habeas petition in Federal District Court, which denied his claims. SeeJohnsonv. Mechling, F. Supp. 2d (MD Pa. ). Finally, Johnson appealed to the Third Circuit, which reversed the District Court and ordered his conviction overturned.UnderJackson, evidence is sufficient to support a conviction if, “after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution,anyrational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.” U. S., at .In light of the testimony at Johnson’s trial, the Court of Appeals acknowledged that “[a] trier of fact could reasonably infer . . . that Johnson and Walker shared a common intent to confront, threaten or harass Williams.”Johnsonv.Mechling, Fed. Appx. , ( ). As for the notion that “Johnson shared Walker’s intent to kill Williams,” however, the court concluded that was “mere speculation” that no rational factfinder could accept as true.Ibid.The court stated that “a reasonable inference is one where the fact inferred is ‘more likely than not to flow from the proved fact on which it is made to depend.’ ”Id.,at – (quotingCommonwealthv. McFarland, Pa. , , A.2d , ()). In order for a jury’s inferences to be permissible, the court reasoned, they must “ ‘flow from facts and circumstances proven in the record’ ” that are “ ‘of such volume and quality as to overcome the presumption of innocence.’ ” Fed. Appx., at (quotingCommonwealthv. Bostick, A.2d , (Pa. Super. )).At the outset, we note that it was error for the Court of Appeals to look to Pennsylvania law in determining what distinguishes a reasoned inference from “mere speculation.” UnderJackson, federal courts must look to state law for “the substantive elements of the criminal offense,” U. S., at , n. , but the minimum amount of evidence that the Due Process Clause requires to prove the offense is purely a matter of federal law.Under the deferential federal standard, the approach taken by the Court of Appeals was flawed because it un- duly impinged on the jury’s role as factfinder.Jacksonleaves juries broad discretion in deciding what inferences to draw from the evidence presented at trial, requiring only that jurors “draw reasonable inferences from basic facts to ultimate facts.”Id., at . This deferential standard does not permit the type of fine-grained factual parsing in which the Court of Appeals engaged. For example, in addressing Brown and Ramsey’s testimony that Williams was “walked” and “forced” into the alleyway, the court objected that the witnesses did not describe any “physical action” supporting the conclusion that force was used. Fed. Appx., at . Absent some specific testimony that “Johnson actively pushed, shoved, ordered or otherwise forced the victim into the alley, or prevented him from leaving it,”ibid.,the court could see no reason- able basis for the jury’s conclusion that Johnson had a specific intent to help kill Williams.That analysis is flawed for two reasons. First, the coercive nature of Johnson and Walker’s behavior could be inferred from other circumstances not involving the direct use of force: Walker was noticeably concealing a weapon, and he had been heatedly threatening to kill Williams after a violent confrontation earlier in the day. Johnson and Walker kept Williams between them in a single-file line on the way to the alley, where Johnson stood at the entrance while the other two entered, suggesting that Johnson may have been prepared to prevent Williams from fleeing. And second, even if Williams was not coerced into the alley, the jury still could have concluded that Johnson helped lead or lure him there to facilitate the murder.Taken in the light most favorable to the prosecution, the trial testimony revealed that Johnson and Walker “ran the streets together,” and had attempted to collect a debt from Williams earlier on the day of the murder. Williams resisted the collection, managing to humiliate Walker in the process by giving him a public thrashing with a broomstick. This enraged Walker to the point that he repeatedly declared over the course of the day in Johnson’s presence that he intended to kill Williams. Then, while Walker was noticeably concealing a bulky object under his trenchcoat, Johnson helped escort Williams into an alley, where Johnson stood at the entryway while Walker pulled out a shotgun and shot Williams in the chest.On the basis of these facts, a rational jury could infer that Johnson knew that Walker was armed with a shotgun; knew that he intended to kill Williams; and helped usher Williams into the alleyway to meet his fate. The jury in this case was convinced, and the only question underJacksonis whether that finding was so insupportable as to fall below the threshold of bare rationality. The state court of last review did not think so, and that determination in turn is entitled to considerable deference under AEDPA, U. S. C. §(d).Affording due respect to the role of the jury and the state courts, we conclude that the evidence at Johnson’s trial was not nearly sparse enough to sustain a due process challenge underJackson. The evidence was sufficient to convict Johnson as an accomplice and a co-conspirator in the murder of Taraja Williams. The Commonwealth’s petition for certiorari and the motion to proceedin forma pauperisare granted, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered."}

Decided January , 2011Per Curiam.ICalifornia’s parole statute provides that the Board of Prison Terms “shall set a release date unless it determines that ... consideration of the public safety requires a more lengthy period of incarceration.” Cal. Penal Code Ann. §(b) (West Supp. ). If the Board denies parole, the prisoner can seek judicial review in a state habeas petition. The California Supreme Court has explained that “the standard of review properly is characterized as whether ‘some evidence’ supports the conclusion that the inmate is unsuitable for parole because he or she currently is dangerous.”In re Lawrence, Cal. 4th , , P. 3d , (). See alsoIn re Shaputis, Cal. 4th , –, P. 3d , ();In re Rosenkrantz, Cal. 4th , –, P. 3d , ().ARespondent Damon Cooke was convicted of attempted first-degree murder in , and a California court sentenced him to an indeterminate term of seven years to life in prison with the possibility of parole. In November , the board determined that Cooke was not yet suitable for parole, basing its decision on the “especially cruel and callous manner” of his commitment offense, App. to Pet. for Cert. 50a; his failure to participate fully in rehabilitative programs; his failure to develop marketable skills; and three incidents of misconduct while in prison. The board admitted that Cooke had received a favorable psychological report, but it dismissed the report as not credible because it included several inconsistent and erroneous statements.Cooke filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in State Superior Court. The court denied his petition. “The record indicates,” it said, “that there was some evidence, including but certainly not limited to the life offense, to support the board’s denial.”Id., at 42a. Cooke subsequently filed a habeas petition with the California Court of Appeal and a petition for direct review by the California Supreme Court. Both were denied.In October , Cooke filed a federal habeas petition pursuant to U. S. C. § challenging the parole board’s determination. The District Court denied his petition. The Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that California’s parole statute created a liberty interest protected by the Due Process Clause, and that “California’s ‘some evidence’ requirement” was a “component” of that federally protected liberty interest.Cookev.Solis, F. 3d , (). It then concluded that the state court had made an “unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence” under §(d)(2) by finding any evidence at all that Cooke would pose a threat to public safety if released.Id., at .BRespondent Elijah Clay was convicted of first-degree murder in , and a California court sentenced him to imprisonment for seven years to life with the possibility of parole. In , the board found Clay suitable for parole, but the Governor exercised his authority to review the case and found Clay unsuitable for parole. See Cal. Const., Art. 5, §8(b); Cal. Penal Code Ann. §.2 (West ). The Governor cited the gravity of Clay’s crime; his extensive criminal history, which reflected “the culmination of a life of crime,” App. to Pet. for Cert. 116a; his failure to participate fully in self-help programs; and his unrealistic plans for employment and housing after being paroled. Regarding the last factor, the Governor concluded that Clay would be likely to return to crime, given his propensity for substance abuse and lack of a viable means of employment.Clay filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in State Superior Court. That court denied Clay’s petition, as did the California Court of Appeal. The California Supreme Court denied review.Clay subsequently filed a federal petition for a writ of habeas corpus, which the District Court granted. The District Court concluded that the Governor’s reliance on the nature of Clay’s long-past commitment offense vio-lated Clay’s right to due process, and dismissed each of the other factors the Governor cited as unsupported by the record. The Ninth Circuit affirmed, agreeing with the District Court’s conclusion that “the Governor’s decision was an unreasonable application of California’s ‘some evidence’ rule and was an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented.”Clayv.Kane, Fed. Appx. , ().IIIn granting habeas relief based on its conclusion that the state courts had misapplied California’s “some evidence” rule, the Ninth Circuit must have assumed either that federal habeas relief is available for an error of state law, or that correct application of the State’s “some evidence” standard is required by the federal Due Process Clause. Neither assumption is correct.As to the first: The habeas statute “unambiguously provides that a federal court may issue a writ of habeas corpus to a state prisoner ‘only on the ground that he is in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States.’ ”Wilsonv.Corcoran, U. S., at 4) (quoting U. S. C. §(a)). “We have stated many times that ‘federal habeas corpus relief does not lie for errors of state law.’ ”Estellev.McGuire, U. S. , () (quotingLewisv.Jeffers, U. S. , ()).As for the Due Process Clause, standard analysis under that provision proceeds in two steps: We first ask whether there exists a liberty or property interest of which a person has been deprived, and if so we ask whether the procedures followed by the State were constitutionally sufficient.Kentucky Dept. of Correctionsv.Thompson, U. S. , (). Here, the Ninth Circuit held that California law creates a liberty interest in parole, see F. 3d, at . While we have no need to review that holding here, it is a reasonable application of our cases. SeeBoard of Pardonsv.Allen, U. S. , – ();Greenholtzv.Inmates of Neb. Penal and Correctional Complex, U. S. 1, ().Whatever liberty interest exists is, of course, astateinterest created by California law. There is no right under the Federal Constitution to be conditionally released before the expiration of a valid sentence, and the States are under no duty to offer parole to their prisoners.Id.,at 7. When, however, a State creates a liberty interest, the Due Process Clause requires fair procedures for its vindication—and federal courts will review the application of those constitutionally required procedures. In the context of parole, we have held that the procedures required are minimal. InGreenholtz, we found that a prisoner subject to a parole statute similar to California’s received adequate process when he was allowed an opportunity to be heard and was provided a statement of the reasons why parole was denied. U. S., at . “The Constitution,” we held, “does not require more.”Ibid.Cooke and Clay received at least this amount of process: They were allowed to speak at their parole hearings and to contest the evidence against them, were afforded access to their records in advance, and were notified as to the reasons why parole was denied. F. 3d, at –; App. to Pet. for Cert. 69a–80a; Cal. Penal Code Ann. §§, .5 (West Supp. ).That should have been the beginning and the end of the federal habeas courts’ inquiry into whether Cooke and Clay received due process. Instead, however, the Court of Appeals reviewed the state courts’ decisions on the merits and concluded that they had unreasonably determined the facts in light of the evidence. See F. 3d, at –; Fed. Appx., at –. Other Ninth Circuit cases have done the same. See,e.g.,Pearsonv.Muntz, F. 3d , (). No opinion of ours supports converting California’s “some evidence” rule into a substantive federal requirement. The liberty interest at issue here is the interest in receiving parole when the California standards for parole have been met, and the minimum procedures adequate for due-process protection of that interest are those set forth inGreenholtz.* SeeHaywardv.Marshall, F. 3d , ( ) (en banc).Greenholtzdid not inquire into whether the constitutionally requisite procedures provided by Nebraska produced the result that the evidence required;a fortioriit is no federal concern here whether California’s “some evidence” rule of judicial review (a procedure beyond what the Constitution demands) was correctly applied.It will not do to pronounce California’s “some evidence” rule to be “a component” of the liberty interest, F. 3d, at . Such reasoning would subject to federal-court merits review the application of all state-prescribed procedures in cases involving liberty or property interests, including (of course) those in criminal prosecutions. That has never been the law. To the contrary, we have long recognized that “a ‘mere error of state law’ is not a denial of due process.”Englev.Isaac, U. S. , , n. (); see alsoEstelle, U. S., at –. Because the only federal right at issue is procedural, the relevant inquiry is what process Cooke and Clay received, not whether the state court decided the case correctly.The Ninth Circuit’s questionable finding that there wasnoevidence in the record supporting the parole denials is irrelevant unless there is a federal right at stake, as §(a) requires. Seeid., at . The short of the matter is that the responsibility for assuring that the constitutionally adequate procedures governing California’s parole system are properly applied rests with California courts, and is no part of the Ninth Circuit’s business.The petition for a writ of certiorari and respondents’ motions for leave to proceedin forma pauperisare granted.The judgments below areReversed.* Cooke and Clay argue that the greater protections afforded to the revocation of good-time credits should apply, citingIn re Rosenkrantz, Cal. 4th , –, P. 3d , (), a California Supreme Court case that refers to our good-time-credits decision inSuperintendent,Mass. Correctional Institution at Walpolev.Hill, U. S. (). ButRosenkrantzdid not purport to equate California’s parole system with good-time credits. It citesHilltwice. The first citation merely observes that the court relied uponHillin an earlier opinion adopting the “some evidence” test for decisions torevokeparole that had previously been granted. Cal. 4th, at , P. 3d, at . The second citation, which does occur in the part of the opinion discussing the need for “some evidence” review in parole decisions, simply borrows language fromHillto support the proposition that “ ‘[r]equiring a modicum of evidence’ ” can “ ‘help to prevent arbitrary deprivations.’ ” Cal. 4th, at , P. 3d, at (quotingHill, U. S., at ). In any event, the question of which due process requirements apply is one of federal law, not California law; and neither of these citations comes close to addressing that question. Any doubt on that score is resolved by a subsequent footnote stating that the court’s decision is premised only on state law. Cal. 4th, at , n. , P. 3d, at , n. ."}
{"file_name": "per curiam_2015_1_577.json", "author": "per curiam", "year": 2015, "text": "–. Decided October 5, 2015Per Curiam.A criminal defendant “shall enjoy the right . . . to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.” U. S. Const., Amdt. 6. We have held that this right requires effective counsel in both state and federal prosecutions, even if the defendant is unable to afford counsel.Gideonv.Wainwright, U. S. , () . Counsel is unconstitutionallyineffective if his performance is both deficient, meaning his errors are “so serious” that he no longer functions as “counsel,” and prejudicial, meaning his errors deprive the defendant of a fair trial.Stricklandv.Washington, U. S. , () . Applying this standard in name only, the Court of Appeals of Maryland held that James Kulbicki’s defense attorneys were unconstitutionally ineffective. We summarily reverse.In , Kulbicki shot his -year-old mistress in the head at pointblank range. The two had been ensnarled in a paternity suit, and the killing occurred the weekend before a scheduled hearing about unpaid child support. At Kulbicki’s trial, commencing in , Agent Ernest Peele of the FBI testified as the State’s expert on Comparative Bullet Lead Analysis, or CBLA. In testimony of the sort CBLA experts had provided for decades, Peele testified that the composition of elements in the molten lead of a bullet fragment found in Kulbicki’s truck matched the composition of lead in a bullet fragment removed from the victim’s brain; a similarity of the sort one would “ ‘expect’ ” if “ ‘examining two pieces of the same bullet.’ ” Md. , , A. 3d , (). He further testified that a bullet taken from Kulbicki’s gun was not an “exac[t]” match to the bullet fragments, but was similar enough that the two bullets likely came from the same package.Id.,at –, A. 3d, at –. After considering this ballistics evidence, additional physical evidence from Kulbicki’s truck, and witness testimony, the jury convicted Kulbicki of first-degree murder.Kulbicki then filed a petition for post-conviction relief, which lingered in state court until when Kulbicki added a claim that his defense attorneys were ineffective for failing to question the legitimacy of CBLA. By then, years after his conviction, CBLA had fallen out of favor. Indeed, Kulbicki supplemented his petition once more in after the Court of Appeals of Maryland held for the first time that CBLA evidence was not generally accepted by the scientific community and was therefore inadmissible. SeeClemonsv.State, Md. , , A. 2d , ().Kulbicki lost in the lower state courts and appealed to the Court of Appeals of Maryland. At that point, Kulbicki abandoned his claim of ineffective assistance with respect to the CBLA evidence, but the high court vacated Kulbicki’s conviction on that ground alone. Kulbicki’s counsel, according to the court, should have found a report coauthored by Agent Peele in that “presaged the flaws in CBLA evidence.” Md., at , A. 3d, at . One of the many findings of the report was that the composition of lead in some bullets was the same as that of lead in other bullets packaged many months later in a separate box. Rather than conduct “further research to explain the existence of overlapping compositions,” the authors “speculated” that coincidence (or, in one case, the likelihood that separately packaged bullets originated from the same source of lead) caused the overlap.Id., at , A. 3d, at . The Court of Appeals opined that this lone finding should have caused the report’s authors to doubt“that bullets produced from different sources of lead would have a unique chemical composition,” the faulty assumption that ultimately led the court to reject CBLA evidence years later.Ibid.; seeClemons,supra, –, A. 2d, at . The authors’ “failure to fully explore the variance,” the Court of Appeals concluded, was “at odds with the scientific method.” Md., at , A. 3d, at .In the Court of Appeals’ view, any good attorney should have spotted this methodological flaw. The court held that counsel’s failure to unearth the report, to identify one of its findings as “at odds with the scientific method,” and to use this methodological flaw to cast doubt on CBLA during counsel’s cross-examination of Peele, “fell short of prevailing professional norms.”Id., at –, A. 3d, at –. Concluding that counsel’s supposed deficiency was prejudicial, the court set aside the conviction and ordered a new trial.Id.,at , A. 3d, at –.We reverse. The Court of Appeals offered no support for its conclusion that Kulbicki’s defense attorneys were constitutionally required to predict the demise of CBLA. Instead, the court indulged in the “natural tendency to speculate as to whether a different trial strategy might have been more successful.”Lockhartv.Fretwell, U. S. , () . To combat this tendency, we have “adopted the rule of contemporary assessment of counsel’s conduct.”Ibid. Had the Court of Appeals heeded this rule, it would have “judge[d] the reasonableness of counsel’s challenged conduct . . . viewed as of the time of counsel’s conduct.”Strickland,supra, at .At the time of Kulbicki’s trial in , the validity of CBLA was widely accepted, and courts regularly admitted CBLA evidence until . SeeUnited Statesv.Higgs, F. 3d , ( ). As the Court of Appeals acknowledged, even the report itself did not question the validity of CBLA, concluding that it was a valid and useful forensic tool to match suspect to victim. Md.,at , n. , A. 3d, at , n. . Counsel did not perform deficiently by dedicating their time and focus to elements of the defense that did not involve poking methodological holes in a then-uncontroversial mode of ballistics analysis.That is especially the case here, since there is no reason to believe that a diligent search would even have discovered the supposedly crucial report. The Court of Appeals offered a single citation in support of its sweeping statement that the report “was available” to Kulbicki’s counsel in —a Government Printing Office Web page accessed by the Court of Appeals, apparently conducting its own Internet research nearly two decades after the trial.Id., at , and n. , A. 3d, at , and n. ; see also Brief in Opposition . The Web page indicates that a compilation of forensic studies that included the report was “distributed to various public libraries in .” Md., at , n. , A. 3d, at , n. . But which ones? And in an era of card catalogues, not a worldwide web, what efforts would counsel have had to expend to find the compilation? And had they found it, would counsel really have combed through the entire compilation, and have identified the one (of many) findings in one of the reports, the disregard of which counsel would have recognized to be “at odds with the scientific method”? And then, would effective counsel really have brought to the attention of the jury a report whoseconclusionwas that CBLA was a valid investigative technique in cases just like Kulbicki’s? Neither the Court of Appeals nor Kulbicki has answers. Given the uncontroversial nature of CBLA at the time of Kulbicki’s trial, the effect of the judgment below is to demand that lawyers go “looking for a needle in a haystack,” even when they have “reason to doubt there is any needle there.”Rompillav.Beard, U. S. , () . The Court of Appeals demanded something close to “perfect advocacy”—far more than the “reasonable competence” the right to counsel guarantees.Yarboroughv.Gentry, U. S. 1, 8 () (per curiam).Kulbicki’s trial counsel did not provide deficient performance when they failed to uncover the report and to use the report’s so-called methodological flaw against Peele on cross-examination. (We need not, and so do not, decide whether the supposed error prejudiced Kulbicki.) The petition for writ of certiorari is granted, and the judgment of the Court of Appeals for Maryland is reversed.It is so ordered."}
{"file_name": "per curiam_2007_598_550.json", "author": "per curiam", "year": 2007, "text": "We granted certiorari in this case, U. S. S. C. §(d)(1) by setting aside a capital sentence on the ground that the prosecutor’s closing statement was “unfairly inflammatory.”Weaverv.Bowersox, F. 3d , ( ). Our primary concern was whether the Court of Appeals’ application of the more stringent standard of review mandated by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of , (AEDPA), Stat. , was consistent with our interpretation of that statute. Cf.Careyv.Musladin, U. S. We are now aware of circumstances that persuade us that dismissal of the writ is the appropriate manner in which to dispose of this case.The argument made by the prosecutor in this case was essentially the same as the argument that he made in two other cases—one of which involved respondent’s codefendant. SeeShurnv.Delo, F. 3d , ( );Newlonv.Armontrout, F. Supp. (WD Mo. ), aff’d, F. 2d ( ). In each of those cases, the defendant received a death sentence. Also in each case, the defendant filed a petition seeking federal habeas relief before AEDPA’s effective date. Federal habeas relief was granted in all three cases. The State does not question the propriety of relief in the other two cases because it was clear at the time, as it is now, that AEDPA did not apply to either of them.Respondent argues, for the following reasons, that AEDPA should not govern his case either. Like the defendants inNewlonandShurn, respondent filed his federal habeas petition before the effective date of AEDPA. Instead of considering respondent’s claims, however, the District CourtsU. S.ontestayed the habeas proceedings, noting that respondent had indicated his intention to file a petition for writ of certiorari seeking this Court’s review of the state courts’ denial of postconviction relief. Though the District Court recognized that respondent was not required to seek certiorari from this Court, it concluded that, if “a state prisoner chooses to pursue writ of certiorari, he must first exhaust that remedy before filing a federal habeas corpus petition.” App. to Brief for National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers asAmicus . Thus, the District Court put respondent to a choice: He could forgo filing a petition for certiorari, or his habeas petition would be dismissed.Respondent moved for reconsideration and for the appointment of counsel. The District Court denied both motions, reiterating its view that if respondent sought certiorari, his federal habeas petition would be premature. When respondent notified the District Court that a petition for certiorari had been filed, the court made good on its promise: It dismissed respondent’s habeas petition “without prejudice” to his refiling “following exhaustion of his state proceedings.”Id.,at . Though respondent had filed his habeas petition before AEDPA took effect, the District Court dismissed his petition after the statute was in force.Still without an attorney, respondent requested a certificate of appealability from the District Court. The court denied the request, opining that reasonable jurists could not disagree with the dismissal of respondent’s petition.Id.,at 5–6. Respondent also filed a notice of appeal, which the Court of Appeals construed as a request for a certificate of appealability and rejected.*Respondent refiled his habeas petition after this Court denied review of his state postconviction proceedings. The Eighth Circuit eventually concluded that, because respondent’s petition was filed after AEDPA’s effective date, his claims must be evaluated under that statute’s strict standard of review. SeeWeaverv.Bowersox, F. 3d , ().Our recent decision inLawrencev.Florida, U. S.Lawrenceclarified that “[s]tate review ends when the state courts have finally resolved an application for state postconviction relief”—even if a prisoner files a certiorari petition.Id., at 4); see alsoid., at 4–5) (“[W]e have said that state prisoners need not petition for certiorari to exhaust state remedies” (citingFayv.Noia, U. S. , – ())). Thus, respondent’s habeas petition, which was fully exhausted when filed, did not become unexhausted upon his decision to seek certiorari. Because the petition was not premature, the District Court had no cause to dismiss it.Whether this unusual procedural history leads to the conclusion, as respondent colorably contends, that the AEDPA standard is simply inapplicable to this case, is a question we find unnecessary to resolve. Regardless of the answer to that question, we find it appropriate to exercise our discretion to prevent these three virtually identically situated litigants from being treated in a needlessly disparate manner, simply because the District Court erroneously dismissed respondent’s pre-AEDPA petition.Accordingly, the writ of certiorari is dismissed as improvidently granted.It is so ordered.* Respondent did not seek rehearing or rehearing en bancin the Court of Appeals, nor did he file a petition for writ of certiorari from the denial of the certificate of appealability. Pursuit of either would almost certainly have been futile."}

Decided July 2, 2021Per Curiam.Willie Johnson towed Matthew Reeves’ broken-down car back to the city after finding Reeves stranded on an Alabama dirt road. In payment for this act of kindness, Reeves murdered Johnson, stole his money, and mocked his dying spasms. Years after being convicted of murder and sentenced to death, Reeves sought state postconviction relief, arguing that his trial counsel should have hired an expert to develop sentencing-phase mitigation evidence of intellectual disability. But despite having the burden to rebut the strong presumption that his attorneys made a legitimate strategic choice, Reeves did not callanyof them to testify. The Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals denied relief, stressing that lack of evidence about counsel’s decisions impeded Reeves’ efforts to prove that they acted unreasonably.Reevesv.State, So. 3d , – ().On federal habeas review, the Eleventh Circuit held that this analysis was not only wrong, but indefensible. In an unpublished,per curiamopinion that drew heavily on a dissent from denial of certiorari, the Eleventh Circuit reinterpreted the Alabama court’s lengthy opinion as imposing a simpleper seprohibition on relief in all cases where a prisoner fails to question his counsel.Reevesv.Commissioner,Ala. Dept. of Corrections, Fed. Appx. , – (). It was the Eleventh Circuit, however, that went astray in its “readiness to attribute error.”Woodfordv.Visciotti, U.S. , () (per curiam). Federal habeas courts must defer to reasonable state-court decisions, U. S. C. §(d), and the Alabama court’s treatment of the spotty record in this case was consistent with this Court’s recognition that “the absence of evidence cannot overcome the strong presumption that counsel’s conduct fell within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.”Burtv.Titlow, U.S. , () (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).IIn November , Reeves and some friends decided to “go out looking for some robberies. ”Reeves, So. 3d, at (internal quotation marks omitted). The group’s initial target was a drug dealer in a nearby town, but their car broke down and left them stranded on the side of the road. A few hours later, however, Johnson happened to drive by in his truck and offered to tow the disabled vehicle to Reeves’ house.After they arrived, Reeves, who was riding in the bed of the truck, stuck a shotgun through the rear window of the cab and shot Johnson in the neck. As Johnson sat slumped in the driver’s seat “bleeding heavily and making gagging noises,” Reeves directed the rest of the group to “go through Johnson’s pockets to get his money.”Id., at (internal quotation marks omitted). Throughout the rest of the day, Reeves repeatedly “brag[ged] about having shot Johnson,” boasting that the murder “would earn him a ‘teardrop,’ a gang tattoo acquired for killing someone.”Ibid.(internal quotation marks omitted). And at a party that night, Reeves invented a dance in which he “pretend[ed] to pump a shotgun” and “jerk[ed] his body around in a manner mocking the way that Willie Johnson had died.”Ibid.(brackets and internal quotation marks omitted).Alabama charged Reeves with murder and appointed counsel for him. His attorneys took several steps to develop mitigating evidence, including exploring the possibility that Reeves was intellectually disabled. For example, they obtained extensive records of Reeves’ educational, medical, and correctional history. Counsel also requested funding to hire a neuropsychologist, Dr. John Goff, to evaluate Reeves and prepare mitigation evidence. And when the trial court initially rejected that request, counsel successfully sought reconsideration.After the court granted funding, Reeves’ attorneys managed to acquire additional mental-health records from the State, including documents related to a pretrial competency evaluation that featured a partial administration of an IQ test.[1] The totality of the evidence reflected that Reeves had a troubled childhood, suffered from numerous behavioral difficulties, and was within the “borderline” range of intelligence. While in school—before being expelled for violence and misbehavior—he had been referred to special services for emotional conflict and behavioral issues. But Reeves’ records also showed that he had previously beendeniedspecial educational services for intellectual disability. Counsel also learned that Reeves had attended classes and earned certificates in welding, masonry, and automotive mechanics. And the psychologist who initially evaluated Reeves later opined that he was not intellectually disabled.At some point before trial, Reeves’ attorneys apparently elected to pursue other mitigation strategies instead of hiring Dr. Goff. The record does not reveal the exact reason for this decision—likely because Reeves did not ask them to testify. The record does show, however, that counsel presented a holistic mitigation case. For example, counsel called several witnesses at sentencing—including Reeves’ mother and the psychologist who performed the competency evaluation—and elicited testimony about Reeves’ turbulent childhood, neglectful family, and educational difficulties. The jury, however, recommended a death sentence.Reeves later sought postconviction relief in state court, alleging almost theories of error. Relevant here, he asserted that he was categorically exempt from execution by reason of intellectual disability, seeAtkinsv.Virginia, U.S. (), or at the very least that counsel should have hired Dr. Goff to develop mitigation along those lines for use at sentencing, seePorterv.McCollum, U.S. () (per curiam). At a 2-day hearing in state court, Reeves called two experts, including Dr. Goff. The doctor concluded that Reeves was intellectually disabled, explaining that the so-called Flynn Effect—a controversial theory involving the inflation of IQ scores over time—required adjusting Reeves’ score downward into the 60s.[2] Dr. Goff also cited a number of behavioral assessments that supposedly showed Reeves’ shortcomings in adaptive functioning. For its part, the State offered the expert testimony of Dr. King, who administered his own evaluation and concluded that Reeves was not intellectually disabled. In fact, Dr. King pointed out that Reeves had a leadership role in a drug-dealing group and earned as much as $2, a week.Despite Reeves’ focus on his attorney’s performance, he did not give them the opportunity to explain their actions. Although all three of his lawyers apparently were alive and available, Reeves did not call them to testify.The trial court denied relief, and the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed. First, it agreed that Reeves had failed to prove that he was actually intellectually disabled and thus exempt from execution.Reeves, So. 3d, at . The court specifically addressed Dr. Goff ’s reliance on the Flynn Effect, reiterating that this approach “has not been accepted as scientifically valid by all courts” and was “not settled in the psychological community.”Id., at (internal quotation marks omitted). In fact, even Dr. Goff had “admitted that he did not use the ‘Flynn Effect’ for over years after it was first discovered.”Ibid.Second, the court rejected Reeves’ claim that counsel should have hired an expert to develop mitigating evidence of intellectual disability. Stressing that an attorney’s decision not to hire an expert is “typically [a] strategic decisio[n]” that will “not constitute per se deficient performance,” the court looked to the record to assess the “reasoning behind counsel’s actions.”Id., at , (internal quotation marks omitted). In this case, the court observed, “the record [was] silent as to th[ose] reasons” “because Reeves failed to call his counsel to testify.”Id., at (internal quotation marks omitted). Hence, he could not overcome the “presumption of effectiveness” that courts must afford to trial counsel.Ibid.(internal quotation marks omitted).Reeves sought certiorari, which we denied over a dissent.Reevesv.Alabama, U. S.). The dissent acknowledged that the “absence of counsel’s testimony may make it more difficult for a defendant to meet his burden” of proving deficient performance, but still would have reversed and remanded because it understood the Alabama court to have applied “a categorical rule that counsel must testify in order for a petitioner to succeed on a federal constitutional ineffective- assistance-of-counsel claim.”Id., at 2, 9). Although the dissent cited no decision in which this Court reprimanded a state court for taking that approach, it reasoned that such a rule was contrary to decisions in which this Court had “found deficient performancedespite[attorney] testimony, based on a review of the full record.”Id., at 9).[3]Reeves next sought federal habeas review. The District Court denied relief, but the Eleventh Circuit reversed in part. Like every court before it, the Eleventh Circuit first rejected Reeves’ claim that he was intellectually disabled. Fed. Appx., at . But, it held that his lawyers were constitutionally deficient for not developing more evidence of intellectual disability and that this failure might have changed the outcome of the trial.In reaching that result, the Eleventh Circuit explained that it owed no deference to the “unreasonable” decision of the Alabama court. §(d). Quoting at length from the earlier dissent from denial of certiorari, the panel reasoned that “aper serule that the petitioner must present counsel’s testimony” was clearly contrary to federal law.Id., at –. And, to demonstrate that the Alabama court had applied such a rule, the Eleventh Circuit excised a single statement from a lengthy block quote: “ ‘[T]o overcome the strong presumption of effectiveness, a [state] petitioner must, at his evidentiary hearing, question trial counsel regarding his actions and reasoning.’ ”Id., at (emphasis deleted). The Eleventh Circuit then reasoned that the state court surely must have imposed this “categorical rule” because its opinion also said that Reeves’ “ ‘failure to call his attorneys to testify was fatal to his claims.’ ”Ibid.(emphasis deleted; brackets omitted). But that quote was not quite complete; the original sentence reads, “In this case, Reeves’s failure to call his attorneys to testify is fatal to his claims of ineffective assistance of counsel.”Reeves, So. 3d, at (emphasis added).IIThis case presents a simple question: Did the Alabama court violate clearly established federal law when it rejected Reeves’ claim that his attorneys should have hired an expert?In answering this question, we owe deference to both Reeves’ counselandthe state court. As to counsel, we have often explained that strategic decisions—including whether to hire an expert—are entitled to a “strong presumption” of reasonableness.Harringtonv.Richter, U.S. , (). Defense lawyers have “limited” time and resources, and so must choose from among “ ‘countless’ ” strategic options.Id., at –. Such decisions are particularly difficult because certain tactics carry the risk of “harm[ing] the defense” by undermining credibility with the jury or distracting from more important issues.Id., at .The burden of rebutting this presumption “rests squarely on the defendant,” and “[i]t should go without saying that the absence of evidence cannot overcome [it].”Titlow, U. S., at –. In fact, even if there is reason to think that counsel’s conduct “was far from exemplary,” a court still may not grant relief if “[t]he record does not reveal” that counsel took an approach that no competent lawyer would have chosen.Id., at –.This analysis is “doubly deferential” when, as here, a state court has decided that counsel performed adequately.Id., at (internal quotation marks omitted); see alsoSextonv.Beaudreaux, U. S., at 7–8) (deference is “near its apex” in such cases). A federal court may grant habeas relief only if a state court violated “clearly establishedFederal law, as determined bythe Supreme Courtof the United States.” §(d)(1) (emphasis added). This “wide latitude” means that federal courts can correct only “extreme malfunctions in the state criminal justice syste[m].”Richter, U. S., at , (internal quotation marks omitted). And in reviewing the work of their peers, federal judges must begin with the “presumption that state courts know and follow the law.”Woodford, U. S., at . Or, in more concrete terms, a federal court may grant relief only ifevery“ ‘fairminded juris[t]’ ” would agree thateveryreasonable lawyer would have made a different decision.Richter, U. S., at .A straightforward application of these principles reveals the extent of the Eleventh Circuit’s error. We start, as we must, with the case as it came to the Alabama court. Reeves had filed a -plus-page brief alleging manifold errors, including several theories of ineffective assistance of counsel.Reeves, So. 3d, at –, and n. . Many of these attacked basic strategic choices, including his current argument that counsel should have hired Dr. Goff to develop additional evidence of intellectual disability. Yet, despite Reeves’ determination to find fault with his lawyers, he offered no testimony or other evidence from them.That omission was particularly significant given the “range of possible reasons [Reeves’] counsel may have had for proceeding as they did.”Cullenv.Pinholster, U.S. , () (internal quotation marks omitted). This is not a case in which a lawyer “failed to uncover and presentanyevidence of [Reeves’] mental health or mental impairment, [or] his family background.”Porter, U. S., at (emphasis added). Counsel’s initial enthusiasm to collect Reeves’ records and obtain funding hardly indicates professional neglect and disinterest.Rather, we simply do not know what information and considerations emerged as counsel reviewed the case and refined their strategy. The attorneys may very well have pored over the voluminous evidence in their possession—including those obtainedaftertheir funding request—and identified several reasons that a jury was unlikely to be persuaded by a claim of intellectual disability. After all, although Reeves’ records suggested that his intelligence was below average, they also indicated that he was not intellectually disabled.E.g., So. 3d, at . Counsel might also have been concerned about the evidence of Reeves’ history of violence, criminal past, and behavior problems,ibid., and concluded that presenting these characteristics alongside a full-throated intellectual-disability argument would have convinced the jury that Reeves “was simply beyond rehabilitation,”Pinholster, U. S., at . Or, counsel may have uncovered additional evidence confirming their concerns about an intellectual-disability strategy. Perhaps Reeves informed them, as he later did Dr. King, that he was savvy enough to earn thousands of dollars a week in a drug- dealing operation where he had a leadership role. So. 3d, at .Or, counsel may well have further investigated Dr. Goff and decided that his debatable methodologies would undermine credibility with a local jury—possibly a prescient choice given thatevery single courtto consider the issue has rejected Reeves’ claim of intellectual disability. In fact, around the time that counsel were formulating their trial strategy, Dr. Goff was already performing questionable evaluations. See,e.g.,Kingv.Apfel, WL , *2 (SD Ala., Feb. , ) (Dr. Goff ’s evaluation of a Social Security claimant was “unsupported by the medical evidence,” and “everything elsein the record [was] counter to [his] extreme findings” (emphasis added));Smallv.Apfel, WL , *3, n. 5 (SD Ala., Oct. , ) (“[Dr.] Goff ’s [] conclusions regarding deficits in adaptive behavior are not only mere guesses . . . but also suffer from a lack of support in the record”). It is not unreasonable for a lawyer to be concerned about overreaching.Simply put, if the attorneys had been given the chance to testify, they might have pointed to information justifying the strategic decision to devote their time and efforts elsewhere. Yet, Reeves—possibly pursuing a strategy of his own—declined to put that testimonial evidence before the Alabama court. So given that the Alabama court was entitled to reject Reeves’ claim if trial counsel had any “possible reaso[n] . . . for proceeding as they did,”Pinholster, U. S., at (internal quotation marks omitted), it surely was not obliged to accept Reeves’ blanket assertion on an incomplete evidentiary record that “[n]o reasonable strategy could support counsel’s failure,” ECF Doc. –, at .Rather than defer to this commonsense analysis, the Eleventh Circuit took a path that we have long foreclosed: “mischaracterization of the state-court opinion.”Woodford, U. S., at . As explained above, the Alabama court reasonably concluded that the incomplete evidentiary record—which was notably “silent as to the reasons trial counsel . . . chose not to hire Dr. Goff or another neuropsychologist”—doomed Reeves’ belated efforts to second-guess his attorneys.Reeves, So. 3d, at . The Eleventh Circuit, however, recharacterized this case-specific analysis as a “categorical rule” thatanyprisoner willalwayslose if he fails to call and question “trial counsel regarding his or her actions and reasoning.” Fed. Appx., at (emphasis deleted; internal quotation marks omitted).We think it clear from context that the Alabama court did not apply a blanket rule, but rather determined that the facts of this case did not merit relief. As an initial matter, the Alabama court twice recognized that therecanbe instances of “per sedeficient performance.”Reeves, So. 3d, at –. It simply concluded that here, counsel’s choice regarding experts involved a strategic decision entitled to a presumption of reasonableness.Ibid.Moreover,otherportions of the opinion’s lengthy recitation of the law (which the Eleventh Circuit omitted) belie a categorical approach. In particular, the court twice said that it would consider “ ‘all the circumstances’ ” of the case, and it qualified its supposedly categorical rule by explaining that “counsel shouldordinarilybe afforded an opportunity to explain his actions before being denounced as ineffective.”Id., at , (emphasis added; some internal quotation marks omitted).Other parts of the opinion yield the same interpretation. For example, the court devoted almost nine pages to discussing ineffective assistance of counsel. That would have been a curious choice for a “busy state cour[t]” if a single sentence applying aper serule could have sufficed.Johnsonv.Williams, U.S. , () (state courts need not even “discuss separately every single claim”). Within that lengthy discussion, the court individually mentioned many of Reeves’ specific theories, including his current intellectual-disability argument. Moreover, that the court in a footnote summarily rejecteddifferentineffective- assistance-of-counsel claims for procedural reasons further weighs against imputing aper serule for the theories that the court discussed in the body of its opinion.Reeves, So. 3d, at –, n. .Even more important, the actual analysis of the claim at issue here reflects a case-specific approach. The court did not merely say, as the Eleventh Circuit wrongly suggested, that Reeves’ “ ‘failure to call his attorneys to testify was fatal to his claims.’ ” Fed. Appx., at (brackets omitted). Rather, the opinion prefaced this quote with an important qualifier—“In this case.”Reeves, So. 3d, at (emphasis added). And sure enough, the court proceeded to explain why Reeves could not prevail “in this case”—because “the record [was] silent as to the reasoning behind counsel’s actions.”Id., at (internal quotation marks omitted). To be sure, the record in this particular case happened to be deficient “because Reeves failed to call his counsel to testify.”Ibid.But, this unremarkable observation of cause and effect in light of the facts before the court was hardly an absolute bar ineverycase whereotherrecord evidence might fill in the details. And, it certainly was not contrary to clearly established law given that this Court and the Eleventh Circuit have made the same observation that a silent record cannot discharge a prisoner’s burden.E.g.,Titlow, U. S., at , –;Graysonv.Thompson, F.3d , ( ) (noting that “the record [was] silent as to why trial counsel did not pursue a motion to suppress the evidence,” and that “habeas counsel did not inquire as to trial counsel’s reasons for not raising such a claim”).[4]* * *For the foregoing reasons, we grant the petition for a writ of certiorari, reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals, and remand the case for proceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.[REDACTED] dissents.Notes1Around the same time, one of Reeves’ attorneys withdrew from the case, explaining that Reeves “ha[d] been combative, argumentative[,] and ha[d] totally refused to assist [the attorney] in any manner.” Electronic Case Filing in No. 1:–cv– (SD Ala.) (ECF), Doc. –1, pp. 3, . Another attorney replaced him.2According to some proponents of this theory, the Flynn Effect posits that IQ scores increase “by approximately 0.3 points per year,” which in turn “requires that the IQ test be ‘normed’ periodically so that the mean score on the test stays the same” and “that 0.3 points be deducted from [a] full-scale IQ score achieved on an IQ test for each year since the test was last normed.”Reevesv.State, So. 3d , (Ala. Crim. App. ).3We note that this dissent—unlike the Eleventh Circuit—considered the case before it entered the exceedingly deferential posture of federal habeas review. Moreover, the dissent didnotconclude that Reeves was entitled to relief on the merits of his claim, but instead would have “remand[ed] so that the [Alabama court] could explain why, given the full factual record, Reeves’ counsel’s choices constituted reasonable performance.” U. S., at ).4Today’s dissent suggests that a more recent decision—Statev.M.D.D. Crim. App., Oct. , )—illustrates that Alabama courts understandReevesto announce aper serule.Post, at 6–9, and n. 4 (opinion of [REDACTED], J.). But that case does the exact opposite. InM.D.D., the petitioner alleged that his attorney should have called a medical expert at trial, yet he did not have the attorney testify at the postconviction hearing. WL , *5–*6. The Alabama court denied relief after examining the evidence and identifying a “sound, strategic reason for not calling [the expert] to testify.”Id., at *8 (discussing a possible downside to having the expert testify); see alsoid., at *9 (explaining, in the alternative, why the petitioner suffered no prejudice). Notably, the court did so after citingReevesand quoting thesame languagethat the dissent claims represents aper serule. Compareid., at *7–*8 (“[A] Rule petitioner must, at his evidentiary hearing, question trial counsel regarding his or her actions and reasoning. . . . In this case, the failure to have trial counsel testify is fatal to [the petitioner’s] claims of ineffective assistance of counsel” (emphasis deleted; internal quotation marks omitted)), withpost, at 1, 5. Again, it would have been strange for a busy Alabama court to devote pages to rejecting a claim if a categorical bar would have sufficed."}

Decided March , 2015Per Curiam.Petitioner Torrey Dale Grady was convicted in North Carolina trial courts of a second degree sexual offense in and of taking indecent liberties with a child in . After serving his sentence for the latter crime, Grady was ordered to appear in New Hanover County Superior Court for a hearing to determine whether he should be subjected to satellite-based monitoring (SBM) as a recidivist sex offender. See N. C. Gen. Stat. Ann. §§–.(a)(1), –.40B (). Grady did not dispute that his prior convictions rendered him a recidivist under the relevant North Carolina statutes. He argued, however, that the monitoring program—under which he would be forced to wear tracking devices at all times—would violate his Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. Unpersuaded, the trial court ordered Grady to enroll in the program and be monitored for the rest of his life. Record in No. - (N. C. App.), pp. 3–4, –.Grady renewed his Fourth Amendment challenge on appeal, relying on this Court's decision inUnited Statesv.Jones, U. S. In that case, this Court held that police officers had engaged in a \"search\" within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment when they installed and monitored a Global Positioning System (GPS) tracking device on a suspect's car. The North Carolina Court of Appeals rejected Grady's argument, concluding that it was foreclosed by one of its earlier decisions. App. to Pet. for Cert. 5a–7a. In that decision, coincidentally namedStatev.Jones, the court had said:\"Defendant essentially argues that if affixing a GPS to an individual's vehicle constitutes a search of the individual, then the arguably more intrusive act of affixing an ankle bracelet to an individual must constitute a search of the individual as well. We disagree. The context presented in the instant case—which involves a civil SBM proceeding—is readily distinguishable from that presented in [United Statesv.]Jones, where the Court considered the propriety of a search in the context of a motion to suppress evidence. We conclude, therefore, that the specific holding in [United Statesv.]Jonesdoes not control in the casesub judice. C. App. E. 2d , ().The court in Grady's case held itself bound by this reasoning and accordingly rejected his Fourth Amendment challenge. App. to Pet. for Cert. 6a–7a. The North Carolina Supreme Court in turn summarily dismissed Grady's appeal and denied his petition for discretionary review. N. C. , S. E. 2d (). Grady now asks us to reverse these decisions.[1]The only explanation provided below for the rejection of Grady's challenge is the quoted passage fromStatev.Jones. And the only theory we discern in that passage is that the State's system of nonconsensual satellite-based monitoring does not entail a search within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. That theory is inconsistent with this Court's precedents.InUnited Statesv.Jones, we held that \"the Government's installation of a GPS device on a target's vehicle, and its use of that device to monitor the vehicle's movements, constitutes a 'search.' \" U. S., at 3) (footnote omitted). We stressed the importance of the fact that the Government had \"physically occupied private property for the purpose of obtaining information.\"Id., at 4). Under such circumstances, it was not necessary to inquire about the target's expectation of privacy in his vehicle's movements in order to determine if a Fourth Amendment search had occurred. \"Where, as here, the Government obtains information by physically intruding on a constitutionally protected area, such a search has undoubtedly occurred.\"Id. 3 (slip op., at 6, n. 3).We reaffirmed this principle inFloridav.Jardines, U. S., at 3–4), where we held that having a drug-sniffing dog nose around a suspect's front porch was a search, because police had \"gathered . . . information by physically entering and occupying the [curtilage of the house] to engage in conduct not explicitly or implicitly permitted by the homeowner.\" See alsoid., at 9) (a search occurs \"when the government gains evidence by physically intruding on constitutionally protected areas\"). In light of these decisions, it follows that a State also conducts a search when it attaches a device to a person's body, without consent, for the purpose of tracking that individual's movements.In concluding otherwise, the North Carolina Court of Appeals apparently placed decisive weight on the fact that the State's monitoring program is civil in nature. C. App. E. 2d, at (\"the instant case . . . involves a civil SBM proceeding\"). \"It is well settled,\" however, \"that the Fourth Amendment's protection extends beyond the sphere of criminal investigations,\"Ontariov.Quon, U. S. , () , and the government's purpose in collecting information does not control whether the method of collection constitutes a search. A building inspector who enters a home simply to ensure compliance with civil safety regulations has undoubtedly conducted a search under the Fourth Amendment. SeeCamarav.Municipal Court of City and County of San Francisco, U. S. , () (housing inspections are \"administrative searches\" that must comply with the Fourth Amendment).In its brief in opposition to certiorari, the State faults Grady for failing to introduce \"evidence about the State's implementation of the SBM program or what information, if any, it currently obtains through the monitoring process.\" Brief in Opposition . Without evidence that it is acting to obtain information, the State argues, \"there is no basis upon which this Court can determine whether North Carolina conducts a 'search' of an offender enrolled in its SBM program.\"Ibid.(citingJones, U. S. 5 (slip op., at 7, n. 5) (noting that a government intrusion is not a search unless \"done to obtain information\")). In other words, the State argues that we cannot be sure its program for satellite-basedmonitoringof sex offenders collects any information. If the very name of the program does not suffice to rebut this contention, the text of the statute surely does:\"The satellite-based monitoring program shall use a system that provides all of the following:\"(1) Time-correlated and continuous tracking of the geographic location of the subject . . . .\"(2) Reporting of subject's violations of prescriptive and proscriptive schedule or location requirements.\" N. C. Gen. Stat. Ann. §–.(c).The State's program is plainly designed to obtain information. And since it does so by physically intruding on a subject's body, it effects a Fourth Amendment search.That conclusion, however, does not decide the ultimate question of the program's constitutionality. The Fourth Amendment prohibits onlyunreasonablesearches. The reasonableness of a search depends on the totality of the circumstances, including the nature and purpose of the search and the extent to which the search intrudes upon reasonable privacy expectations. See,e.g.,Samsonv.California, U. S. () (suspicionless search of parolee was reasonable);Vernonia School Dist. 47Jv.Acton, U. S. () (random drug testing of student athletes was reasonable). The North Carolina courts did not examine whether the State's monitoring program is reasonable—when properly viewed as a search—and we will not do so in the first instance.The petition for certiorari is granted, the judgment of the Supreme Court of North Carolina is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.Notes1Grady aims his petition at the decisions of both North Carolina appellate courts. See Pet. for Cert. 1. Because we treat the North Carolina Supreme Court's dismissal of an appeal for lack of a substantial constitutional question as a decision on the merits, it is that court's judgment, rather than the judgment of the Court of Appeals, that is subject to our review under U. S. C. §(a). SeeR. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.v.Durham County, U. S. – ()."}

In the event the petition for a writ of certiorari is granted, the order shall terminate upon the sending down of the judgment of this Court.* * * * * *This emergency application and another, Agudath Israel of America, et al. v. Cuomo, No. , present the same issue, and this opinion addresses both cases.Both applications seek relief from an Executive Order issued by the Governor of New York that imposes very severe restrictions on attendance at religious services in areas classified as “red” or “orange” zones. In red zones, no more than persons may attend each religious service, and in orange zones, attendance is capped at . The two applications, one filed by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn and the other by Agudath Israel of America and affiliated entities, contend that these restrictions violate the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment, and they ask us to enjoin enforcement of the restrictions while they pursue appellate review. Citing a variety of remarks made by the Governor, Agudath Israel argues that the Governor specifically targeted the Orthodox Jewish community and gerrymandered the boundaries of red and orange zones to ensure that heavily Orthodox areas were included. Both the Diocese and Agudath Israel maintain that the regulations treat houses of worship much more harshly than comparable secular facilities. And they tell us without contradiction that they have complied with all public health guidance, have implemented additional precautionary measures, and have operated at % or % capacity for months without a single outbreak.The applicants have clearly established their entitlement to relief pending appellate review. They have shown that their First Amendment claims are likely to prevail, that denying them relief would lead to irreparable injury, and that granting relief would not harm the public interest. SeeWinterv.Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., U.S. 7, (). Because of the need to issue an order promptly, we provide only a brief summary of the reasons why immediate relief is essential.Likelihood of success on the merits. The applicants have made a strong showing that the challenged restrictions violate “the minimum requirement of neutrality” to religion.Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc.v.Hialeah, U.S. , (). As noted by the dissent in the court below, statements made in connection with the challenged rules can be viewed as targeting the “ ‘ultra-Orthodox [Jewish] community. 9, ) (Park, J., dissenting). But even if we put those comments aside, the regulations cannot be viewed as neutral because they single out houses of worship for especially harsh treatment.[1]In a red zone, while a synagogue or church may not admit more than persons, businesses categorized as “essential” may admit as many people as they wish. And the list of “essential” businesses includes things such as acupuncture facilities, camp grounds, garages, as well as many whose services are not limited to those that can be regarded as essential, such as all plants manufacturing chemicals and microelectronics and all transportation facilities. See New York State, Empire State Development, Guidance for Determining Whether a Business Enterprise is Subject to a Workforce Reduction Under Recent Executive Orders, https://esd.ny.gov/guidance-executive-order-. The disparate treatment is even more striking in an orange zone. While attendance at houses of worship is limited to persons, even non-essential businesses may decide for themselves how many persons to admit.These categorizations lead to troubling results. At the hearing in the District Court, a health department official testified about a large store in Brooklyn that could “literally have hundreds of people shopping there on any given day.” App. to Application in No. , Exh. D, p. . Yet a nearby church or synagogue would be prohibited from allowing more than or people inside for a worship service. And the Governor has stated that factories and schools have contributed to the spread of COVID–,id., Exh. H, at 3; App. to Application in No. , pp. , , but they are treated less harshly than the Diocese’s churches and Agudath Israel’s synagogues, which have admirable safety records.Because the challenged restrictions are not “neutral” and of “general applicability,” they must satisfy “strict scrutiny,” and this means that they must be “narrowly tailored” to serve a “compelling” state interest.Church of Lukumi, U. S., at . Stemming the spread of COVID– is unquestionably a compelling interest, but it is hard to see how the challenged regulations can be regarded as “narrowly tailored.” They are far more restrictive than any COVID–related regulations that have previously come before the Court,[2] much tighter than those adopted by many other jurisdictions hard-hit by the pandemic, and far more severe than has been shown to be required to prevent the spread of the virus at the applicants’ services. The District Court noted that “there ha[d] not been any COVID– outbreak in any of the Diocese’s churches since they reopened,” and it praised the Diocese’s record in combatting the spread of the disease. Supp. , ). It found that the Diocese had been constantly “ahead of the curve, enforcing stricter safety protocols than the State required.”Ibid.Similarly, Agudath Israel notes that “[t]he Governor does not dispute that [it] ha[s] rigorously implemented and adhered to all health protocols and that there has been no outbreak of COVID– in [its] congregations.” Application in No. , at .Not only is there no evidence that the applicants have contributed to the spread of COVID– but there are many other less restrictive rules that could be adopted to minimize the risk to those attending religious services. Among other things, the maximum attendance at a religious service could be tied to the size of the church or synagogue. Almost all of the Diocese churches immediately affected by the Executive Order can seat at least people, about can accommodate at least , and 2 can seat over 1,. Similarly, Agudath Israel of Kew Garden Hills can seat up to . It is hard to believe that admitting more than people to a 1,–seat church or –seat synagogue would create a more serious health risk than the many other activities that the State allows.Irreparable harm. There can be no question that the challenged restrictions, if enforced, will cause irreparable harm. “The loss of First Amendment freedoms, for even minimal periods of time, unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.”Elrodv.Burns, U.S. , () (plurality opinion). If only people are admitted to each service, the great majority of those who wish to attend Mass on Sunday or services in a synagogue on Shabbat will be barred. And while those who are shut out may in some instances be able to watch services on television, such remote viewing is not the same as personal attendance. Catholics who watch a Mass at home cannot receive communion, and there are important religious traditions in the Orthodox Jewish faith that require personal attendance. App. to Application in No. , at –.Public interest. Finally, it has not been shown that granting the applications will harm the public. As noted, the State has not claimed that attendance at the applicants’ services has resulted in the spread of the disease. And the State has not shown that public health would be imperiled if less restrictive measures were imposed.Members of this Court are not public health experts, and we should respect the judgment of those with special expertise and responsibility in this area. But even in a pandemic, the Constitution cannot be put away and forgotten. The restrictions at issue here, by effectively barring many from attending religious services, strike at the very heart of the First Amendment’s guarantee of religious liberty. Before allowing this to occur, we have a duty to conduct a serious examination of the need for such a drastic measure.The dissenting opinions argue that we should withhold relief because the relevant circumstances have now changed. After the applicants asked this Court for relief, the Governor reclassified the areas in question from orange to yellow, and this change means that the applicants may hold services at % of their maximum occupancy. The dissents would deny relief at this time but allow the Diocese and Agudath Israel to renew their requests if this recent reclassification is reversed.There is no justification for that proposed course of action. It is clear that this matter is not moot. SeeFederal Election Comm’nv.Wisconsin Right to Life,Inc., U.S. , ();Friends of the Earth, Inc.v.Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc., U.S. , (). And injunctive relief is still called for because the applicants remain under a constant threat that the area in question will be reclassified as red or orange. See,e.g.,Susan B. Anthony Listv.Driehaus, U.S. , (). The Governor regularly changes the classification of particular areas without prior notice.[3] If that occurs again, the reclassification will almost certainly bar individuals in the affected area from attending services before judicial relief can be obtained. At most Catholic churches, Mass is celebrated daily, and “Orthodox Jews pray in [Agudath Israel’s] synagogues every day.” Application in No. , at 4. Moreover, if reclassification occurs late in a week, as has happened in the past, there may not be time for applicants to seek and obtain relief from this Court before another Sabbath passes. Thirteen days have gone by since the Diocese filed its application, and Agudath Israel’s application was filed over a week ago. While we could presumably act more swiftly in the future, there is no guarantee that we could provide relief before another weekend passes. The applicants have made the showing needed to obtain relief, and there is no reason why they should bear the risk of suffering further irreparable harm in the event of another reclassification.For these reasons, we hold that enforcement of the Governor’s severe restrictions on the applicants’ religious services must be enjoined.It is so ordered.Notes1CompareTrumpv.Hawaii, U.

The court then pro-ceeded to award attorney’s fees under § to a prevailing defendant without first determining that “the plaintiff’s action was frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation.” The court’s fee award rested solely on its interpretation of federal law; the court explicitly refused to award fees under state law.Id., at –, P. 3d, at –.

Decided April 1, 2013Per Curiam.Respondent Otis Lee Rodgers, challenging his state con- viction, sought a writ of habeas corpus from the United States District Court for the Central District of California. He claimed the state courts violated his Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel by declining to ap- point an attorney to assist in filing a motion for a new trial notwithstanding his three prior waivers of the right to counseled representation. The District Court denied respondent’s petition, and he appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which granted habeas relief. F.3d , (). Because the Court of Appeals erred in concluding that respondent’s claim is supported by “clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,” U. S. C. §(d)(1), its judgment must be reversed.IIn , the State of California charged respondent with making criminal threats, assault with a firearm, and be- ing a felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition. Before his arraignment, respondent executed a valid waiver of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel, electing to represent himself. SeeFarettav.California, U.S. , (). By the time of his preliminary hearing, however, respondent changed his mind and retained counsel. Then, two months later, he fired his lawyer and again waived his right to counsel. Two months after that, respondent again changed his mind and asked the court to appoint an attorney. The court did so. Shortly before trial, however, respondent for the third time surrendered his right to counsel. He proceeded to trialpro se. On June , , the jury returned a verdict of guilty.After the verdict was read, respondent asked the state trial court to provide an attorney to help him file a motion for a new trial. The trial judge deferred ruling on the motion to appoint counsel, and respondent later renewed the request in writing. Neither the oral nor the written motion included reasons in support of his request; and when offered a chance to supplement or explain his motion at a later hearing, respondent declined to do so. The trial court denied the request for counsel. Respondent’spro semotion for a new trial was likewise denied.On direct review the California Court of Appeal affirmed respondent’s convictions and sentence. As relevant here, it concluded that his history of vacillating between counseled and self-representation, the lack of support for his motion, his demonstrated competence in defending his case, and his insistence that he “ ‘c[ould] do the motion [him]self’ ” but “ ‘just need[ed] time to perfect it,’ ” App. to Pet. for Cert. –, justified the trial court’s denial of his post-trial request for counsel. The state appellate court also distinguished its decision from that of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit inMenefieldv.Borg, F.2d (), reasoning that the habeas petitioner inMenefieldhad stated reasons justifying his request for counsel, whereas respondent’s request was unreasoned and unexplained. The state appellate court concluded that “[b]ecause the [trial] court was not given any reason to grant [respondent’s] motion, we cannot find that the court abused its discretion in declining to do so.” App. to Pet. for Cert. .Having failed to obtain relief in state court, respondent filed a federal habeas petition, arguing that the California courts had violated his Sixth Amendment right to counsel by not providing an attorney to help with his new-trial motion. The District Court denied the petition but granted a certificate of appealability. The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that respondent’s “ Sixth Amendment right to counsel was violated when the trial court denied his timely request for representation for a new trial motion.” F. 3d, at .To reach the conclusion that respondent’s right to counsel in these circumstances was clearly established by the Supreme Court of the United States, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit invoked certain Sixth Amendment precedents from its own earlier cases and from cases in other Circuits. From those precedents, the panel identified two relevant principles that it deemed to have been clearly established by this Court’s cases: first, that a defendant’s waiver of his right to trial counsel does not bar his later election to receive assistance of counsel at a later critical stage of the prosecution, absent proof by the State that the reappointment request was made in bad faith, seeid.,at –; and, second, that a new-trial motion is a critical stage, seeid., at –. Combining these two propositions, the court held that respondent had a clearly established right to the reappointment of counsel for purposes of his new-trial motion, and that the California courts—which vest the trial judge with discretion to approve or deny such requests based on the totality of the circumstances, seePeoplev.Lawley, Cal. 4th , –, P.3d , – ()—violated that right by refusing to order the reappointment of counsel. F. 3d, at –.IIThe starting point for cases subject to §(d)(1) is to identify the “clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States” that governs the habeas petitioner’s claims. SeeWilliamsv.Taylor, U.S. , ();Knowlesv.Mirzayance, U.S. , (). As indicated above, the parties here dispute whether two principles of law are clearly established under this framework. One is whether, after a defendant’s valid waiver of his right to trial counsel underFaretta, a post-trial, preappeal motion for a new trial is a critical stage of the prosecution. For purposes of analysis here, it will be assumed, without so holding, that it is.The other disputed question is whether, after a defendant’s valid waiver of counsel, a trial judge has discretion to deny the defendant’s later request for reappointment of counsel. In resolving this question in respondent’s favor, the Court of Appeals first concluded (correctly) that “the Supreme Court has never explicitly addressed a criminal defendant’s ability to re-assert his right to counsel” once he has validly waived it. F. 3d, at (internal quotation marks omitted). It then (also correctly) recognized that the lack of a Supreme Court decision on nearly identical facts does not by itself mean that there is no clearly established federal law, since “a general standard” from this Court’s cases can supply such law.Yarboroughv.Alvarado, U.S. , (). The Court of Appeals erred, however, in its application of this latter proposition to the controlling issues here.It is beyond dispute that “[t]he Sixth Amendment safeguards to an accused who faces incarceration the right to counsel at all critical stages of the criminal process.”Iowav.Tovar, U.S. , – (); seeUnited Statesv.Cronic, U.S. , – ();Gideonv.Wainwright, U.S. , (). It is just as well settled, however, that a defendant also has the right to “proceedwithoutcounsel when he voluntarily and intelligently elects to do so.”Faretta, U. S., at .There can be some tension in these two principles. As theFarettaCourt observed, “[t]here can be no blinking the fact that the right of an accused to conduct his own defense seems to cut against the grain of this Court’s decisions holding that the Constitution requires that no accused can be convicted and imprisoned unless he has been accorded the right to the assistance of counsel.”Id.,at . California has resolved this tension by adopting the framework under review. Under that approach, trial judges are afforded discretion when considering postwaiver requests for counsel; their decisions on such requests must be based on the totality of the circumstances, “includ[ing] ‘the quality of [the defendant’s] representation of [himself], the defendant’s prior proclivity to substitute counsel, the reasons for the request, the length and stage of the proceedings, and the disruption or delay [that] might reasonably be expected to follow the granting of such a motion.’ ”Lawley,supra,at , P. 3d, at (quotingPeoplev.Windham, Cal. 3d , , P.2d , – (); final alteration in original). The state appellate court applied those rules to the case at bar, concluding that the totality of the circumstances—and especially the shifting nature of respondent’s preferences, the unexplained nature of his motion, and his demonstrated capacity to handle the incidents of trial—supported the trial court’s decision. App. to Pet. for Cert. –.The Court of Appeals, however, has resolved that tension differently in its own direct-review cases. It has adopted a “ ‘strong presumption that a defendant’s post-trial request for the assistance of an attorney should not be refused,’ ” F. 3d, at (quotingRobinsonv.Ignacio, F.3d , ( ); emphasis deleted), as well as a default rule that, “ ‘in the absence of extraordinary circumstances,’ a defendant’s post-trial revocation of his waiver should be allowed unless the government can show that the request is made ‘for a bad faith purpose,’ ”id.,at (quotingMenefield, F. 2d,at ; emphasis deleted).It is unnecessary for present purposes to judge the merits of these two approaches or determine what rule the Sixth Amendment in fact establishes for postwaiver requests of appointment of counsel. All this case requires—and all the Court of Appeals was empowered to do under §(d)(1)—is to observe that, in light of the tension between the Sixth Amendment’s guarantee of “the right to counsel at all critical stages of the criminal process,”Tovar,supra, at –, and its concurrent promise of “a constitutional right to proceedwithoutcounsel when [a criminal defendant] voluntarily and intelligently elects to do so,”Faretta,supra, at , it cannot be said that California’s approach is contrary to or an unreasonable ap- plication of the “general standard[s]” established by the Court’s assistance-of-counsel cases.Alvarado,supra, at .The Court of Appeals’ contrary conclusion rested in part on the mistaken belief that circuit precedent may be used to refine or sharpen a general principle of Supreme Court jurisprudence into a specific legal rule that this Court has not announced.Parkerv.Matthews, U. S., at –) (“The highly generalized standard for evaluating claims of prosecutorial misconduct set forth inDarden[v.Wainwright, U.S. ()] bears scant resemblance to the elaborate, multistep test employed by the Sixth Circuit here”); see F. 3d, at , . The error in this approach is subtle, yet substantial. Although an appellate panel may, in accordance with its usual law-of-the-circuit procedures, look to circuit precedent to ascertain whether it has already held that the particular point in issue is clearly established by Supreme Court precedent, see,e.g.,Tolliverv.Sheets, F.3d , , n. 6 ( ) (“We are bound by prior Sixth Circuit determinations that a rule has been clearly established”);Chambersv.McDaniel, F.3d , ( ), it may not canvass circuit decisions to determine whether a particular rule of law is so widely accepted among the Federal Circuits that it would, if presented to this Court, be accepted as correct., at –);Renicov.Lett, U.S. , – (). The Court of Appeals failed to abide by that limitation here. Its resulting holding was erroneous and must be reversed.IIIThe Court expresses no view on the merits of the underlying Sixth Amendment principle the respondent urges. And it does not suggest or imply that the underlying issue, if presented on direct review, would be insubstantial. This opinion is instead confined to the determination that the conclusion of the California courts that there was no Sixth Amendment violation is not contrary to “clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.” §(d)(1).The petition for a writ of certiorari and respondent’s motion to proceedin forma pauperisare granted. The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered."}

Decided December 7, 2009Per Curiam.Police officers responded to a complaint of a disturbance near Allen Road in Brownstown, Michigan. Officer Christopher Goolsby later testified that, as he and his partner approached the area, a couple directed them to a residence where a man was “going crazy.” Docket No. , WL , *1 (Mich. App., Mar. , )(per curiam)(alteration and internal quotation marks omitted). Upon their arrival, the officers found a household in considerable chaos: a pickup truck in the driveway with its front smashed, damaged fenceposts along the side of the property, and three broken house windows, the glass still on the ground outside. The officers also noticed blood on the hood of the pickup and on clothes inside of it, as well as on one of the doors to the house. (It is disputed whether they noticed this immediately upon reaching the house, but undisputed that they noticed it before the allegedly unconstitutional entry.) Through a window, the officers could see respondent, Jeremy Fisher, inside the house, screaming and throwing things. The back door was locked, and a couch had been placed to block the front door.The officers knocked, but Fisher refused to answer. They saw that Fisher had a cut on his hand, and they asked him whether he needed medical attention. Fisher ignored these questions and demanded, with accompanying profanity, that the officers go to get a search warrant. Officer Goolsby then pushed the front door partway open and ventured into the house. Through the window of the open door he saw Fisher pointing a long gun at him. Officer Goolsby withdrew.Fisher was charged under Michigan law with assault with a dangerous weapon and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony. The trial court concluded that Officer Goolsby violated the Fourth Amendment when he entered Fisher’s house, and granted Fisher’s motion to suppress the evidence obtained as a result—that is, Officer Goolsby’s statement that Fisher pointed a rifle at him. The Michigan Court of Appeals initially remanded for an evidentiary hearing, see Docket No. , WL (Dec. , )(per curiam),after which the trial court reinstated its order. The Court of Appeals then affirmed over a dissent by Judge Talbot. See WL , at *2;id.,at *2–*5. The Michigan Supreme Court granted leave to appeal, but, after hearing oral argument, it vacated its prior order and denied leave instead; three justices, however, would have taken the case and reversed on the ground that the Court of Appeals misapplied the Fourth Amendment. See Mich. , N. W. 2d (). Because the decision of the Michigan Court of Appeals is indeed contrary to our Fourth Amendment case law, particularlyBrigham Cityv.Stuart, U. S. (), we grant the State’s petition for certiorari and reverse.“[T]he ultimate touchstone of the Fourth Amendment,” we have often said, “is ‘reasonableness.’ ”Id.,at . Therefore, although “searches and seizures inside a home without a warrant are presumptively unreasonable,”Grohv.Ramirez, U. S. , () (internal quotation marks omitted), that presumption can be overcome. For example, “the exigencies of the situation [may] make the needs of law enforcement so compelling that the warrantless search is objectively reasonable.”Minceyv.Arizona, U. S. , – ().Brigham Cityidentified one such exigency: “the need to assist persons who are seriously injured or threatened with such injury.” U. S., at . Thus, law enforcement officers “may enter a home without a warrant to render emergency assistance to an injured occupant or to protect an occupant from imminent injury.”Ibid.This “emergency aid exception” does not depend on the officers’ subjective intent or the seriousness of any crime they are investigating when the emergency arises.Id.,at –. It requires only “an objectively reasonable basis for believing,”id.,at , that “a person within [the house] is in need of immediate aid,”Mincey,supra,at .Brigham Cityillustrates the application of this standard. There, police officers responded to a noise complaint in the early hours of the morning. “As they approached the house, they could hear from within an altercation occurring, some kind of fight.” U. S., at (internal quotation marks omitted). Following the tumult to the back of the house whence it came, the officers saw juveniles drinking beer in the backyard and a fight unfolding in the kitchen. They watched through the window as a juvenile broke free from the adults restraining him and punched another adult in the face, who recoiled to the sink, spitting blood.Ibid.Under these circumstances, we found it “plainly reasonable” for the officers to enter the house and quell the violence, for they had “an objectively reasonable basis for believing both that the injured adult might need help and that the violence in the kitchen was just beginning.”Ibid.A straightforward application of the emergency aid exception, as inBrigham City, dictates that the officer’s entry was reasonable. Just as inBrigham City, the police officers here were responding to a report of a disturbance. Just as inBrigham City, when they arrived on the scene they encountered a tumultuous situation in the house—and here they also found signs of a recent injury, perhaps from a car accident, outside. And just as inBrigham City, the officers could see violent behavior inside. Although Officer Goolsby and his partner did not see punches thrown, as did the officers inBrigham City, they did see Fisher screaming and throwing things. It would be objectively reasonable to believe that Fisher’s projectiles might have a human target (perhaps a spouse or a child), or that Fisher would hurt himself in the course of his rage. In short, we find it as plain here as we did inBrigham Citythat the officer’s entry was reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.The Michigan Court of Appeals, however, thought the situation “did not rise to a level of emergency justifying the warrantless intrusion into a residence.” WL , at *2. Although the Court of Appeals conceded that “there was evidence an injured person was on the premises,” it found it significant that “the mere drops of blood did not signal a likely serious, life-threatening injury.”Ibid.The court added that the cut Officer Goolsby observed on Fisher’s hand “likely explained the trail of blood” and that Fisher “was very much on his feet and apparently able to see to his own needs.”Ibid.Even a casual review ofBrigham Cityreveals the flaw in this reasoning. Officers do not need ironclad proof of “a likely serious, life-threatening” injury to invoke the emergency aid exception. The only injury police could confirm inBrigham Citywas the bloody lip they saw the juvenile inflict upon the adult. Fisher argues that the officers here could not have been motivated by a perceived need to provide medical assistance, since they never summoned emergency medical personnel. This would have no bearing, of course, upon their need to assure that Fisher was not endangering someone else in the house. Moreover, even if the failure to summon medical personnel conclusively established that Goolsby did not subjectively believe, when he entered the house, that Fisher or someone else was seriously injured (which is doubtful), the test, as we have said, is not what Goolsby believed, but whether there was “an objectively reasonable basis for believing” that medical assistance was needed, or persons were in danger,Brigham City,supra,at ;Mincey,supra,at .It was error for the Michigan Court of Appeals to replace that objective inquiry into appearances with its hindsight determination that there was in fact no emergency. It does not meet the needs of law enforcement or the demands of public safety to require officers to walk away from a situation like the one they encountered here. Only when an apparent threat has become an actual harm can officers rule out innocuous explanations for ominous circumstances. But “[t]he role of a peace officer includes preventing violence and restoring order, not simply rendering first aid to casualties.”Brigham City,supra, at . It sufficed to invoke the emergency aid exception that it was reasonable to believe that Fisher had hurt himself (albeit nonfatally) and needed treatment that in his rage he was unable to provide, or that Fisher was about to hurt, or had already hurt, someone else. The Michigan Court of Appeals required more than what the Fourth Amendment demands.* * *The petition for certiorari is granted. The judgment of the Michigan Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.We have taken the facts from the opinion of the Michigan Court of Appeals.

{"file_name": "per curiam_2013_505_569.json", "author": "per curiam", "year": 2013, "text": "–. Decided June 3, 2013Per Curiam.In this case, the Court of Appeals held that respondent, who was convicted of rape and other serious crimes, is en- titled to relief under the federal habeas statute because the Supreme Court of Nevada unreasonably applied clearly established Supreme Court precedent regarding a crim- inal defendant’s constitutional right to present a defense. At his trial, respondent unsuccessfully sought to introduce evidence for the purpose of showing that the rape victim previously reported that he had assaulted her but that the police had been unable to substantiate those allegations. The state supreme court held that this evidence was properly excluded, and no prior decision of this Court clearly establishes that the exclusion of this evidence violated respondent’s federal constitutional rights. The decision of the Court of Appeals is therefore reversed.IRespondent Calvin [REDACTED] had a tumultuous decade-long romantic relationship with Annette Heathmon. In , after several previous attempts to end the relationship, Heathmon relocated to a new apartment in North Las Vegas without telling respondent where she was mov- ing. Respondent learned of Heathmon’s whereabouts, and on the night of October , , he visited her apartment. What happened next was the focus of respondent’s trial.Heathmon told police and later testified that respondent forced his way into her apartment and threatened to kill her with a screwdriver if she did not have sex with him. After raping Heathmon, respondent hit her, stole a ring from her bedroom, and dragged her out of the apartment and toward his car by the neck and hair. A witness confronted the couple, and respondent fled. Police observed injuries to Heathmon’s neck and scalp that were consis-tent with her account of events, and respondent was eventually arrested.Although respondent did not testify at trial, he discussed Heathmon’s allegations with police shortly after his arrest, and his statements were admitted into evidence at trial. Respondent acknowledged that Heathmon might have agreed to have sex because the two were alone and “she was scared that [he] might do something,” Tr. , but he claimed that the sex was consensual. Respondent also admitted striking Heathmon inside the apartment but denied pulling her outside by the neck and hair.Shortly before trial, Heathmon sent the judge a letter recanting her prior accusations and stating that she would not testify. She went into hiding, but police eventually found her and took her into custody as a material wit- ness. Once in custody, Heathmon disavowed the letter and agreed to testify. When asked about the letter at trial, she stated that three of respondent’s associates had forced her to write it and had threatened to hurt her if she appeared in court.At trial, the theory of the defense was that Heathmon had fabricated the sexual assault and had reported it to police in an effort to control respondent. To support that theory, the defense sought to introduce testimony and police reports showing that Heathmon had called the police on several prior occasions claiming that respondent had raped or otherwise assaulted her. Police were unable to corroborate many of these prior allegations, and in several cases they were skeptical of her claims. Although the trial court gave the defense wide latitude to cross-examine Heathmon about those prior incidents, it refused to admit the police reports or to allow the defense to call as witnesses the officers involved. The jury found respondent guilty, and he was sentenced to life imprisonment.Respondent appealed his conviction to the Nevada Su- preme Court, arguing, among other things, that the trial court’s refusal to admit extrinsic evidence relating to the prior incidents violated his federal constitutional right to present a complete defense, but the Nevada Supreme Court rejected that argument.After exhausting his remedies in state court, respondent filed a federal habeas petition, again arguing that the trial court’s ruling had violated his right to present a defense. Applying AEDPA’s deferential standard of review, the District Court denied relief, but a divided panel of the Ninth Circuit reversed. F.3d (). The majority held that extrinsic evidence of Heathmon’s prior allegations was critical to respondent’s defense, that the exclusion of that evidence violated respondent’s constitutional right to present a defense, and that the Nevada Supreme Court’s decision to the contrary was an unreasonable application of this Court’s precedents.Id.,at –. Although it acknowledged that the state court had ruled that the evidence was inadmissible as a matter of state law, the Ninth Circuit concluded that the impact of the State’s rules of evidence on the defense “was disproportionate to the state’s interest in . . . exclusion.”Id., at –. Finding that the trial court’s erroneous evidentiary ruling was not harmless,id.,at –, the Ninth Circuit ordered the State either to retry or to release respondent.IIThe Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of (AEDPA) authorizes a federal habeas court to grant relief to a prisoner whose state court conviction “involved an unreasonable application of . . . clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.” U. S. C. §(d)(1). It is settled that a federal habeas court may overturn a state court’s application of federal law only if it is so erroneous that “there is no possibility fairminded jurists could disagree that the state court’s decision conflicts with this Court’s precedents.”Harringtonv.Richter, U. S., at ). Applying that deferential standard, we conclude that the Nevada Supreme Court’s decision was reasonable.“[T]he Constitution guarantees criminal defendants ‘a meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense,’ ”Cranev.Kentucky, U.S. , () (quotingCaliforniav.Trombetta, U.S. , ()), but we have also recognized that “ ‘state and federal rulemakers have broad latitude under the Constitution to establish rules excluding evidence from criminal trials,’ ”Holmesv.South Carolina, U.S. , () (quotingUnitedStatesv.Scheffer, U.S. , ()). Only rarely have we held that the right to present a complete defense was violated by the exclusion of defense evidence under a state rule of evidence. See U. S., at (rule did not rationally serve any discernible purpose);Rockv.Arkansas, U.S. , () (rule arbitrary);Chambersv.Mississippi, U.S. , – () (State did not even attempt to explain the reason for its rule);Washingtonv.Texas, U.S. , () (rule could not be rationally defended).As the Ninth Circuit conceded, “[t]he Nevada Supreme Court recognized and applied the correct legal principle.” F. 3d, at . But contrary to the Ninth Circuit’s conclusion, the State Supreme Court’s application of our clearly established precedents was reasonable. The starting point in the state court’s analysis was a state statute that generally precludes the admission of extrinsic evidence of “[s]pecific instances of the conduct of a witness, for the purpose of attacking or supporting the witness’ credibility, other than conviction of crime.” App. to Pet. for Cert. ; see Nev. Rev. Stat. §.(3) (). The purpose of that rule, the Nevada Supreme Court has explained, “is to focus the fact-finder on the most impor- tant facts and conserve ‘judicial resources by avoiding mini-trials on collateral issues.’ ”Abbottv.State, Nev. , , P.3d , () (quotingStatev.Long, S.W.3d , (Mo. )). These are “good reason[s]” for limiting the use of extrinsic evidence,Clarkv.Arizona, U.S. , (), and the Nevada statute is akin to the widely accepted rule of evidence law that generally precludes the admission of evidence of specific instances of a witness’ conduct to prove the witness’ character for untruthfulness. See Fed. Rule Evid. (b); C. Mueller & L. Kirkpatrick, Evidence §6., pp. – (4th ed. ). The constitutional propriety of this rule cannot be seriously disputed.As an exception to the prohibition contained in Nev. Rev. Stat. §.(3), the Nevada Supreme Court held inMillerv.State, Nev. , –, P.2d , – (), that “in a sexual assault case defense counsel may cross-examine a complaining witness about previous fab- ricated sexual assault accusations and, if the witness denies making the allegations, may introduce extrinsic evidence to prove that fabricated charges were made by that witness in the past.” App. to Pet. for Cert. . But in order to introduce evidence showing that the witness previously made false allegations, the defendant must file written notice, and the trial court must hold a hearing.Miller,supra,at , P. 2d, at . Respondent did not file the requisite notice, and the State Supreme Court upheld the exclusion of evidence of prior sexual assault complaints on this basis.No decision of this Court clearly establishes that this notice requirement is unconstitutional. Nor, contrary to the reasoning of the Ninth Circuit majority, see F. 3d, at –, do our cases clearly establish that the Constitution requires a case-by-case balancing of interests before such a rule can be enforced. The decision on which the Ninth Circuit relied,Michiganv.Lucas, U.S. (), is very far afield. In that case, we reversed a decision holding that the Sixth Amendment categorically prohibits the enforcement of a rule that required a rape defendant to provide pretrial notice if he wished to introduce evidence of his prior sexual relationship with the complaining witness. The Court did not even suggest, much less hold, that it is unconstitutional to enforce such a rule unless a case-by-case balancing of interests weighs in favor of enforcement. Instead, the Court “express[ed] no opinion as to whether or not preclusion was justified in th[at] case” and left it for the state courts to address that question in the first instance.Id., at . No fair-minded jurist could think thatLucasclearly establishes that the enforcement of the Nevada rule in this case is inconsistent with the Constitution.Some of the evidence that respondent sought to in- troduce concerned prior incidents in which the victim re- ported that respondent beat her up but did not sexually assault her, and the state supreme court did not view itsMillerdecision as applying in such circumstances. But the state court did not simply invoke the rule set out in Nev. Rev. Stat. §.(3). Rather, the court reasoned that the proffered evidence had little impeachment value because at most it showed simply that the victim’s reports could not be corroborated. The admission of extrinsic evidence of specific instances of a witness’ conduct to impeach the witness’ credibility may confuse the jury, unfairly embarrass the victim, surprise the prosecution, and unduly prolong the trial. No decision of this Court clearly establishes that the exclusion of such evidence for such reasons in a particular case violates the Constitution.In holding that respondent is entitled to habeas relief, the Ninth Circuit pointed to two of its own AEDPA decisions in which it granted habeas relief to state prisoners who were not allowed to conduct a full cross-examination of the witnesses against them. F. 3d, at – (discussingFowlerv.Sacramento Cty. Sheriff’s Dept., F.3d , – ( ) andHolleyv.Yarborough, F.3d , – ( )). Those cases in turn relied on Supreme Court decisions holding that various restrictions on a defendant’s ability tocross-examinewitnesses violate the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment. See,e.g.,Oldenv.Kentucky, U.S. , () (per curiam);Delawarev.Van Arsdall, U.S. , – ();Davisv.Alaska, U.S. , – (). But this Court has never held that the Confrontation Clause entitles a criminal defendant to introduceextrinsic evidencefor impeachment purposes. SeeDelawarev.Fensterer, U.S. , () (per curiam) (observing that “the Confrontation Clause is generally satisfied when the defense is given a full and fair opportunity to . . . expose [testimonial] infirmities through cross-examination”). See alsoJordanv.Warden, F.3d , ( );Brownv.Ruane, F.3d , ( ).The Ninth Circuit elided the distinction between cross-examination and extrinsic evidence by characterizing the cases as recognizing a broad right to present “evidence bearing on [a witness’] credibility.” F. 3d, at . By framing our precedents at such a high level of generality, a lower federal court could transform even the most imaginative extension of existing case law into “clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court.” U. S. C. §(d)(1). In thus collapsing the distinction between “anunreasonableapplication of federal law” and what a lower court believes to be “anincorrectorerroneousapplication of federal law,”Williamsv.Taylor, U.S. , (), the Ninth Circuit’s approach would defeat the substantial deference that AEDPA requires.The petition for a writ of certiorari and respondent’s motion to proceedin forma pauperisare granted.

In , he kidnaped -year-old Adria Sauceda, raped her with a large stick, and bludgeoned her to death with a piece of asphalt. He was convicted of mur-der and sentenced to death by a Texas court. He now seeks a stay of execution on the ground that his conviction was obtained in violation of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations (Vienna Convention), Apr. , , U. S. T. , T. I. A. S. No. . He relies onCase Concerning Avena and Other Mexican Nationals (Mex.v.U. S.), I. C. J. (Judgment of Mar. ), in which the International Court of Justice (ICJ) held that the United States had violated the Vienna Convention by failing to notify him of his right to consular assistance. His ar-gument is foreclosed byMedellínv.Texas, U. S. ()(Medellín I), in which we held that neither theAvenadecision nor the President’s Memorandum purporting to implement that decision constituted directly enforceable federal law. U. S., at –.Leal and the United States ask us to stay the execution so that Congress may consider whether to enact legislation implementing theAvenadecision. Leal contends that the Due Process Clause prohibits Texas from executing him while such legislation is under consideration. This argument is meritless. The Due Process Clause does not prohibit a State from carrying out a lawful judgment in light of unenacted legislation that might someday authorize a collateral attack on that judgment.The United States does not endorse Leal’s due process claim. Instead, it asks us to stay the execution until January in support of our “future jurisdiction to review the judgment in a proceeding” under this yet-to-be-enacted legislation. Brief for United States –3, n. 1. It relies on the fact that on June , , Senator Patrick Leahy introduced implementing legislation in the Senate with the Executive Branch’s sup-port. No implementing legislation has been introduced in the House.We reject this suggestion. First, we are doubtful that it is ever appropriate to stay a lower court judgment in light of unenacted legislation. Our task is to rule on what the law is, not what it might eventually be. In light ofMedellín I, it is clear that there is no “fair prospect that a majority of the Court will conclude that the decision below was erroneous,”O’Brienv.O’Laughlin, U. S., at 2) ([REDACTED], J., in chambers), and our task should be at an end. Neither the United States nor [REDACTED],post, at 1–6 (dissenting opinion), cites a single instance in this Court’s history in which a stay issued under analogous circumstances.Even if there were circumstances under which a stay could issue in light of proposed legislation, this case would not present them. Medellín himself sought a stay of execution on the ground that Congress might enact implementing legislation. We denied his stay application, explaining that “Congress has not progressed beyond the bare introduction of a bill in the four years since the ICJ ruling and the four months since our ruling in[Medellín I].”Medellínv.Texas, U. S. , ()(per curiam)(Medellín II). It has now been seven years since the ICJ ruling and three years since our decision inMedellín I, making a stay based on the bare introduction of a bill in a single house of Congress even less justified. If a statute implementingAvenahad genuinely been a priority for the political branches, it would have been enacted by now.The United States and [REDACTED] complain of the grave international consequences that will follow from Leal’s execution.Post, at 4. Congress evidently did not find these consequences sufficiently grave to prompt its enactment of implementing legislation, and we will follow the law as written by Congress. We have no authority to stay an execution in light of an “appeal of the President,”post, at 6, presenting free-ranging assertions of foreign policy consequences, when those assertions come unaccompanied by a persuasive legal claim.Finally, we noted inMedellín IIthat “[t]he beginning premise for any stay . . . must be that petitioner’s confession was obtained unlawfully,” and that “[t]he United States has not wavered in its position that petitioner was not prejudiced by his lack of consular access.” U. S., at . Here, the United States studiously refuses to argue that Leal was prejudiced by the Vienna Convention violation, contending instead that the Court should issue a stay simply in light of the possibility that Leal might be able to bring a Vienna Convention claim in federal court, regardless of whether his conviction will be found to be invalid. We decline to follow the United States’ suggestion of granting a stay to allow Leal to bring a claim based on hypothetical legislation when it cannot even bring itself to say that his attempt to overturn his conviction has any prospect of success. We may note that in a portion of its opinion vacated by the Fifth Circuit on procedural grounds, the District Court found that any violation of the Vienna Convention would have been harmless.Lealv.Quarterman, WL , *7 (WD Tex.), vacated in partsub nom.Leal Garciav.Quarterman, F. 3d , – ().The applications for stay of execution presented to [REDACTED] and by him referred to the Court are denied.

Decided June , 2018Per Curiam.In this case, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed a denial of federal habeas relief, U. S. C. §, on the ground that the state court had unreasonably rejected respondent’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The Court of Appeals’ decision ignored well-established principles. It did not consider reasonable grounds that could have supported the state court’s summary decision, and it analyzed respondent’s arguments without any meaningful deference to the state court. Accordingly, the petition for certiorari is granted, and the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.IRespondent Nicholas Beaudreaux shot and killed Wayne Drummond during a late-night argument in . Dayo Esho and Brandon Crowder were both witnesses to the shooting. The next day, Crowder told the police that he knew the shooter from middle school, but did not know the shooter’s name. Esho described the shooter, but also did not know his name. Seventeen months later, Crowder was arrested for an unrelated crime. While Crowder was in custody, police showed him a middle-school yearbook with Beaudreaux’s picture, as well as a photo lineup including Beaudreaux. Crowder identified Beaudreaux as the shooter in the Drummond murder.Officers interviewed Esho the next day. They first spoke with him during his lunch break. They showed him a display that included a recent picture of Beaudreaux and pictures of five other men. Esho tentatively identified Beaudreaux as the shooter, saying his picture “was ‘closest’ to the gunman.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 4a. Later that day, one of the officers found another photograph of Beaudreaux that was taken “closer to the date” of the shooting. Record ER . Beaudreaux looked different in the two photographs. In the first, “ ‘his face [was] a little wider and his head [was] a little higher.’ ”Id.,at ER . Between four and six hours after the first interview, the officers returned to show Esho a second six-man photo lineup, which contained the older picture of Beaudreaux. Beaudreaux’s photo was in a different position in the lineup than it had been in the first one. Esho again identified Beaudreaux as the shooter, telling the officers that the second picture was “ ‘very close.’ ”Id.,at ER –ER . But he again declined to positively state that Beaudreaux was the shooter. Esho was hesitant because there were “a few things” he remembered about the shooter that would require seeing him in person.Id.,at ER –ER . At a preliminary hearing, Esho identified Beaudreaux as the shooter. At trial, Esho explained that it “clicked” when he saw Beaudreaux in person based on “the way that he walked.”Id.,at ER . After seeing him in person, Esho was “sure” that Beaudreaux was the shooter.Ibid.At no time did any investigator or prosecutor suggest to Esho that Beaudreaux was the one who shot Drummond.Ibid.Beaudreaux was tried in for first-degree murder and attempted second-degree robbery. Esho and Crowder both testified against Beaudreaux and both identified him as Drummond’s shooter. The jury found Beaudreaux guilty, and the trial court sentenced him to a term of years to life. Beaudreaux’s conviction was affirmed on direct appeal, and his first state habeas petition was denied.In , Beaudreaux filed a second state habeas petition. He claimed, among other things, that his trial attorney was ineffective for failing to file a motion to suppress Esho’s identification testimony. The California Court of Appeal summarily denied the petition, and the California Supreme Court denied review. Petitioner then filed a federal habeas petition, which the District Court denied.A divided panel of the Ninth Circuit reversed. The panel majority spent most of its opinion conducting ade novoanalysis of the merits of the would-be suppression motion—relying in part on arguments and theories that Beaudreaux had not presented to the state court in his second state habeas petition. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 1a–7a; Record ER –ER . It first determined that counsel’s failure to file the suppression motion constituted deficient performance. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 3a. The circumstances surrounding Esho’s pretrial identification were “unduly suggestive,” according to the Ninth Circuit, because only Beaudreaux’s picture was in both photo lineups.Id.,at 4a. And, relying on Ninth Circuit precedent, the panel majority found that the preliminary hearing was unduly suggestive as well.Ibid.(quotingJohnsonv.Sublett, F. 3d , ( )). The panel majority next concluded that, under the totality of the circumstances, Esho’s identification was not reliable enough to overcome the suggestiveness of the procedures. App. to Pet. for Cert. 5a. The panel majority then determined that counsel’s failure to file the suppression motion prejudiced Beaudreaux, given the weakness of the State’s case.Id.,at 5a–6a. After conducting thisde novoanalysis of Beaudreaux’s ineffectiveness claim, the panel majority asserted that the state court’s denial of this claim was not just wrong, but objectively unreasonable under §(d). Seeid.,at 6a–7a. Judge Gould dissented. He argued that the state court could have reasonably concluded that Beaudreaux had failed to prove prejudice.Id.,at 8a.The State of California petitioned for certiorari.IIUnder the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of (AEDPA), a federal court cannot grant habeas relief “with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim . . . resulted in a decision that was con- trary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by” this Court, or “a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.” §(d). When, as here, there is no reasoned state-court decision on the merits, the federal court “must determine what arguments or theories . . . could have supported the state court’s decision; and then it must ask whether it is possible fairminded jurists could disagree that those arguments or theories are inconsistent with the holding in a prior decision of this Court.”Harringtonv.Richter, U. S. , (). If such dis- agreement is possible, then the petitioner’s claim must be denied.Ibid.We have often emphasized that “this standard is difficult to meet” “because it was meant to be.”Ibid.;e.g., Burtv.Titlow, U. S. , (). The Ninth Circuit failed to properly apply this standard.ATo prove ineffective assistance of counsel, a petitioner must demonstrate both deficient performance and prejudice.Stricklandv.Washington, U. S. , (). The state court’s denial of relief in this case was not an unreasonable application ofStrickland. A fairminded jurist could conclude that counsel’s performance was not deficient because counsel reasonably could have determined that the motion to suppress would have failed. SeePremov.Moore, U. S. , ().[1]This Court has previously described “the approach appropriately used to determine whether the Due Process Clause requires suppression of an eyewitness identification tainted by police arrangement.”Perryv.New Hampshire, U. S. , (). In particular, the Court has said that “due process concerns arise only when law enforcement officers use[d] an identification procedure that isbothsuggestive and unnecessary.”Id., at – (citingMansonv.Braithwaite, U. S. , , (), andNeilv.Biggers, U. S. , (); emphasis added). To be “ ‘impermissibly suggestive,’ ” the procedure must “ ‘give rise to a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.’ ”Id., at (quotingSimmonsv.United States, U. S. , ()). It is not enough that the procedure “may have in some respects fallen short of the ideal.”Id.,at –. Even when an unnecessarily suggestive procedure was used, “suppression of the resulting identification is not the inevitable consequence.”Perry, U. S.,at . Instead, “the Due Process Clause requires courts to assess, on a case-by-case basis, whether improper police conduct created a ‘substantial likelihood of misidentification.’ ”Ibid.(quotingBiggers,supra,at ). “[R]eliability [of the eyewitness identification] is the linchpin’ of that evaluation.”Perry,supra, at (quotingManson, U. S., at ; alterations in original). The factors affecting reliability include “the opportunity of the witness to view the criminal at the time of the crime, the witness’ degree of attention, the accuracy of his prior description of the criminal, the level of certainty demonstrated at the confrontation, and the time between the crime and the confrontation.”Id., at . This Court has held that pretrial identification procedures violated the Due Process Clause only once, inFosterv.California, U. S. (). There, the police used two highly suggestive lineups and “a one-to-one confrontation,” which “made it all but inevitable that [the witness] would identify [the defendant].”Id.,at .[2]In this case, there is at least one theory that could have led a fairminded jurist to conclude that the suppression motion would have failed. SeeRichter,supra, at .[3] The state court could have reasonably concluded that Beaudreaux failed to prove that, “under the ‘totality of the circumstances,’ ” the identification was not “reliable.”Biggers,supra, at . Beaudreaux’s claim was facially deficient because his state habeas petition failed to even address this requirement. See Record ER –ER . And the state court could have reasonably concluded that the totality of the circumstances tipped against Beaudreaux. True, Esho gave a vague initial description of the shooter, seeManson,supra, at (noting the detailed physical description the witness gave “minutes after”), and there was a -month delay between the shooting and the identification, seeBiggers,supra, at (determining that “a lapse of seven months . . . would be a seriously negative factor in most cases”). But, as the District Court found, Esho had a good opportunity to view the shooter, having talked to Beaudreaux immediately after the shooting. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 66a. He also was paying attention during the crime and even remembered Beaudreaux’s distinctive walk. Seeid.,at 64a, 66a.Esho demonstrated a high overall level of certainty in his identification. He chose Beaudreaux’s picture in both photo lineups, and he was “sure” about his identification once he saw Beaudreaux in person. Record ER ; App. to Pet. for Cert. 63a–64a, 66a. There also was “little pressure” on Esho to make a particular identification.Manson,supra, at . It would not have been “ ‘ “objectively unreasonable” ’ ” to weigh the totality of these circumstances against Beaudreaux.Whitev.Woodall, U. S. , ().BThe Ninth Circuit’s opinion was not just wrong. It also committed fundamental errors that this Court has repeatedly admonished courts to avoid.First, the Ninth Circuit effectively inverted the rule established inRichter. Instead of considering the “arguments or theories [that] could have supported” the state court’s summary decision, U. S., at , the Ninth Circuit considered arguments against the state court’s decision that Beaudreaux never even made in his state habeas petition.Additionally, the Ninth Circuit failed to assess Beaudreaux’s ineffectiveness claim with the appropriate amount of deference. The Ninth Circuit essentially evaluated the meritsde novo, only tacking on a perfunctory statement at the end of its analysis asserting that the state court’s decision was unreasonable. But deference to the state court should have been near its apex in this case, which involves aStricklandclaim based on a motion that turns on general, fact-driven standards such as suggestiveness and reliability. The Ninth Circuit’s analysis did not follow this Court’s repeated holding that, “ ‘[t]he more general the rule . . . the more leeway [state] courts have.’ ”Renicov.Lett, U. S. , () (brackets in original). Nor did it follow this Court’s precedents stating that, “because theStricklandstandard is a general standard, a state court has even more latitude to reasonably determine that a defendant has not satisfied that standard.”Knowlesv.Mirzayance, U. S. , (). The Ninth Circuit’s essentiallyde novoanalysis disregarded this deferential standard.* * *The petition for a writ of certiorari and respondent’s motion to proceedin forma pauperisare granted. The judgment of the United States Courts of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.[REDACTED] dissents.Notes1Judge Gould found that the state court could have reasonably concluded that Beaudreaux failed to prove prejudice because the weight of the evidence against him—even without Esho’s identification—would have been sufficient to ensure his conviction. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 8a. We need not reach that issue.2In the first lineup, the suspect was nearly six inches taller than the other two men in the lineup, and was the only one wearing a leather jacket like the one the witness described the robber as wearing.Foster, U. S., at , . Police then arranged a “one-to-one confrontation” in which the witness sat in the same room as the suspect and spoke to him.Id.,at . And in the second lineup, the suspect was the only one in the five man lineup who had been in the original lineup.Id.,at –.3Because our decision merely applies U. S. C. §(d)(1), it takes no position on the underlying merits and does not decide any other issue. SeeKernanv.Cuero, U. S., at 7);Marshallv.Rodgers, U. S. , () (per curiam)."}
