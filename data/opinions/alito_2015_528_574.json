YATES, PETITIONERv.UNITED STATESon writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for\nthe eleventh circuit[February 25, 2015]Justice Alito, concurring in the judgment.This case can and should be resolved on narrow grounds. And\nthough the question is close, traditional tools of statutory\nconstruction confirm that John Yates has the better of the\nargument. Three features of18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71519 stand out to\nme: the statute\u2019s list of nouns, its list of verbs, and its title.\nAlthough perhaps none of these features by itself would tip the\ncase in favor of Yates, the three combined do so.Start with the nouns. Section 1519 refers to \u201cany record,\ndocument, or tangible object.\u201d Thenoscitur a sociiscanon\ninstructs that when a statute contains a list, each word in that\nlist presumptively has a \u201csimilar\u201d meaning. See,e.g.,\nGustafsonv.Alloyd Co.,513 U.\u00a0S. 561,576 (1995). A\nrelated canon,ejusdem generisteaches that general words\nfollowing a list of specific words should usually be read in light\nof those specific words to mean something \u201csimilar.\u201d See,e.g.,\nChristopherv.SmithKline Beecham Corp., 567 U.\u00a0S.\n___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 18). Applying these canons to \u00a71519\u2019s\nlist of nouns, the term \u201ctangible object\u201d should refer to something\nsimilar to records or documents. A fish does not spring to mind\u2014nor\ndoes an antelope, a colonial farmhouse, a hydrofoil, or an oil\nderrick. All are \u201cobjects\u201d that are \u201ctangible.\u201d But who wouldn\u2019t\nraise an eyebrow if a neighbor, when asked to identify something\nsimilar to a \u201crecord\u201d or \u201cdocument,\u201d said \u201ccrocodile\u201d?This reading, of course, has its shortcomings. For instance,\nthis is an imperfectejusdem generiscase because \u201crecord\u201d\nand \u201cdocument\u201d are themselves quite general. And there is a risk\nthat \u201ctangible object\u201d may be made superfluous\u2014what is similar to a\n\u201crecord\u201d or \u201cdocument\u201d but yet is not one? An e-mail, however,\ncould be such a thing. See United States Sentencing Commission,\nGuidelines Manual \u00a72J1.2 and comment. (Nov. 2003) (reading\n\u201crecords, documents, or tangible objects\u201d to \u201cinclud[e]\u201d what is\nfound on \u201cmagnetic, optical, digital, other electronic,or other\nstorage mediums or devices\u201d). An e-mail, afterall, might not be a\n\u201cdocument\u201d if, as was \u201ctraditionally\u201d so, a document was a \u201cpiece\nof paper with information on it,\u201d not \u201cinformation stored on a\ncomputer, electronic storage device, or any other medium.\u201d Black\u2019s\nLaw Dictionary 587\u2013588 (10th ed. 2014). E-mails might also not be\n\u201crecords\u201d if records are limited to \u201cminutes\u201d or other formal\nwritings \u201cdesigned to memorialize [past] events.\u201dId.,at\n1465. A hard drive, however, is tangible and can contain files that\nare precisely akin to even these narrow definitions. Both \u201crecord\u201d\nand \u201cdocument\u201d can be read more expansively, but adding \u201ctangible\nobject\u201d to \u00a71519 would ensure beyond question that electronic files\nare included. To be sure, \u201ctangible object\u201d presumably can capture\nmore than just e-mails; Congress enacts \u201ccatchall[s]\u201d for \u201cknown\nunknowns.\u201dRepublic of Iraqv.Beaty,556 U.\u00a0S.\n848,860 (2009). But wherenoscitur a sociisandejusdem\ngenerisapply, \u201cknown unknowns\u201d should be similar to known\nknowns,i.e.,here, records and documents. This is\nespecially true because reading \u201ctangible object\u201d too broadly could\nrender \u201crecord\u201d and \u201cdocument\u201d superfluous.Next, consider \u00a71519\u2019s list of verbs: \u201calters, destroys,\nmutilates, conceals, covers up, falsifies, or makes a false entry\nin.\u201d Although many of those verbs could apply to nouns as far-flung\nas salamanders, satellites, or sand dunes, the last phrase in the\nlist\u2014\u201cmakes a false entry in\u201d\u2014makes no sense outside of\nfilekeeping. How does one make a false entry in a fish? \u201cAlters\u201d\nand especially \u201cfalsifies\u201d are also closely associated with\nfilekeeping. Not one of the verbs, moreover,cannotbe\napplied to filekeeping\u2014certainly not in the way that \u201cmakes a false\nentry in\u201d is always inconsistent with the aquatic.Again, the Government is not without a response. One can imagine\nCongress trying to write a law so broadly that not every verb lines\nup with every noun. But failure to \u201cline up\u201d may suggest that\nsomething has gone awry in one\u2019s interpretation of a text. Where,\nas here, each of a statute\u2019s verbs applies to a certain category of\nnouns, there is some reason to think that Congress had that\ncategory in mind. Categories, of course, are often underinclusive\nor overinclusive\u2014\u00a71519, for instance, applies to a bomb-threatening\nletter but not a bomb. But this does not mean that categories are\nnot useful or that Congress does not enact them. See,e.g.,\nVancev.Bradley,440 U.\u00a0S. 93\u2013109 (1979). Here,\nfocusing on the verbs, the category of nouns appears to be\nfilekeeping. This observation is not dispositive, but neither is it\nnothing. The Government also contends that \u00a71519\u2019s verbs cut both\nways because it is unnatural to apply \u201cfalsifies\u201d to tangible\nobjects, and that is certainly true. One does not falsify the\noutside casing of a hard drive, but one could falsify or alter data\nphysically recorded on that hard drive.Finally, my analysis is influenced by \u00a71519\u2019s title:\n\u201cDestruction, alteration, or falsification ofrecordsin\nFederal investigations and bankruptcy.\u201d (Emphasis added.) This too\npoints toward filekeeping, not fish. Titles can be useful devices\nto resolve \u201c\u00a0\u2018doubt about the meaning of a statute.\u2019\u00a0\u201dPorterv.Nussle,534 U.\u00a0S. 516\u2013528 (2002)\n(quotingAlmendarez-Torresv.United States,523\nU.\u00a0S. 224,234 (1998)); see alsoLawsonv.FMR\nLLC, 571 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___\u2013___ (2014) (Sotomayor,\u00a0J.,\ndissenting) (slip op., at 4\u20136). The title is especially valuable\nhere because it reinforces what the text\u2019s nouns and verbs\nindependently suggest\u2014that no matter how other statutes might be\nread, this particular one does not cover every noun in the universe\nwith tangible form.Titles, of course, are also not dispositive. Here, if the list\nof nouns did not already suggest that \u201ctangible object\u201d should mean\nsomething similar to records or documents, especially when read in\nconjunction with \u00a71519\u2019s peculiar list of verbs with their focus on\nfilekeeping, then the title would not be enough on its own. In\nconjunction with those other two textual features, however, the\nGovernment\u2019s argument, though colorable, becomes too implausible to\naccept. See,e.g.,Washington State Dept. of Social and\nHealth Servs.v.Guardianship Estate of Keffeler,537\nU.\u00a0S. 371\u2013385 (2003) (focusing on the \u201cproduct of [two] canons\nof construction\u201d which was \u201cconfirmed\u201d by other interpretative\nevidence); cf.Al-Adahiv.Obama, 613 F.\u00a03d\n1102, 1105\u20131106 (CADC 2010) (aggregating evidence).",
