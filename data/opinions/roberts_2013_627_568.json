JOHNSON, et\u00a0al.on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the fourth circuit[March 20, 2013]Chief Justice Roberts, with whom Justice\nScalia and Justice Thomas join, dissenting.The State of North Carolina paid for\nE.\u00a0M.\u00a0A.\u2019s medical expenses under its Medicaid plan.\nE.\u00a0M.\u00a0A. sued those al-leged to have caused her injuries,\neventually settling for an amount that included, among other\nthings, medical expenses already covered by North Carolina. The\nfederal Medicaid statute requires North Carolina to recoup those\nexpenses. But neither the Act nor the regulations issued under it\ntell States how to determine what portion of a third-party recovery\nshould be attributed to medical expenses. The Court concludes that\nNorth Carolina\u2019s law addressing that question is nonetheless\npreempted by the Act.The Court\u2019s reading of the Act, while plausible,\nis not compelled by the statutory text or our precedent. It has the\nunfortunate consequence of denying flexibility to the States\u2014and,\nby necessary implication, the Secretary of Health and Human\nServices\u2014in resolving a policy question with broad significance for\nthis complicated program. In short, the result is both unnecessary\nand unwise. I therefore respectfully dissent.IMedicaid is a cooperative federal-state\nprogram designed to provide medical assistance to certain needy\npopulations. The basic idea is simple: The statute\u2014as interpreted\nby the Secretary of HHS\u2014sets out the requirements for an eligible\nMedicaid program. If States decide to enroll and comply with those\nrequirements, they get federal money. If they don\u2019t, they don\u2019t.\nThe federal contribution is not enough to fully fund any State\u2019s\nprogram; States contribute anywhere from 17 to 50 percent of the\ncosts. See 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71396d(b) (2006 ed., Supp. V). The\nStates have considerable discretion in structuring and\nadministering their programs, subject of course to federal law and\nregulations.In practice, it\u2019s not always so simple. The\nbooks are thick with federal regulations that States must interpret\nand reconcile. By my count, at least 39 federal-court opinions,\nincluding one of our own, have reiterated Judge Friendly\u2019s\nobservation that Medicaid law is \u201calmost unintelligible to the\nuninitiated.\u201d SeeSchweikerv.Gray Panthers,453 U.S.\n34, 43 (1981) (quotingFriedmanv.Berger, 547\nF.2d 724, 727, n.\u00a07 (CA2 1976)); see also 453 U.\u00a0S., at\n43, n.\u00a014 (quoting the District Court\u2019s description of\nMedicaid inFriedmanas \u201can aggravated assault on the\nEnglish language, resistant to attempts to understand it\u201d).\n\u201cPerhaps appreciating the complexity of what it had wrought,\nCongress conferred on the Secretary exceptionally broad authority\nto prescribe standards for applying certain sec-tions of the Act.\u201dSchweiker, supra,at 43. But where the law and the Secretary\nare silent on a specific ques-tion, it is up to the\nStates\u2014sometimes informally advised by the federal Centers for\nMedicare and Medi- caid Services\u2014to make sense of it all in running\ntheir programs.The relevant provisions here require that North\nCaro- lina (1) pay for certain people\u2019s medical care, (2) make\nreasonable efforts to recoup from liable third parties (such as\ntortfeasors and insurers) any medical expenses it paid, and (3) not\nrecoup such payments by imposing a lien on the beneficiary\u2019s\nproperty. Seeante, at 4\u20135; see also 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a71396a(a)(25)(B) (2006 ed.). To comply, North Carolina pays for a\nbeneficiary\u2019s medical expenses on the condition that any such\nexpenses the beneficiary recovers from third parties will go\ntowards repaying the State. See N.\u00a0C. Gen. Stat. Ann.\n\u00a7108A\u201359(a) (Lexis 2011).The difficulty, however, is that tort victims\nseldom seek only medical expenses. Take this case:\nE.\u00a0M.\u00a0A. and her parents sought damages not only for\nmedical expenses, but for lost income, pain and suffering, and\nother things, and ended up settling all these claims for a lump sum\nof $2.8 million. Such a situation poses the question of how much\nNorth Carolina can recoup\u2014indeed, under federal law,mustrecoup\u2014from a lump sum that reflects more than just medical\nexpenses.This puts North Carolina in a tight spot. If it\nfails to recover what it must, it violates federal law. If it takes\na beneficiary\u2019s property beyond medical expenses, it violates\nfederal law. Trying to navigate between these competing\nrequirements\u2014with no interpretive guidance from the Secretary of\nHHS\u2014North Carolina elected to resolve the problem by laying out\nground rules in advance, conditioning a beneficiary\u2019s right to\nrecover from third parties on the beneficiary\u2019s willingness to\nfully repay the State, or, at a minimum, define one-third of her\ndamages as \u201cmedical expenses,\u201d whichever is less. N.\u00a0C. Gen.\nStat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7108A\u201359(a); 108A\u201357(a); see alsoAndrewsv.Haygood, 362 N.\u00a0C. 599, 603\u2013604, 669 S.E.2d 310,\n313\u2013314 (2008).IIThe Court states that \u201c[t]he problem\u201d with\nNorth Carolina\u2019s designation\u2014actual expenses or one-third of the\nrecovery, whichever is less\u2014\u201cis not that it is an unreasonable\napproximation in all cases,\u201d and acknowledges that \u201c[i]n some\ncases, it may well be a fair estimate.\u201dAnte, at 9.\nAccording to the Court, however, because North Carolina\u2019s law\nprovides no \u201cmechanism for determining whether it is a reasonable\napproximation in anyparticularcase,\u201dibid.,(emphasis added), it \u201cdirectly conflict[s]\u201d with the \u201cclear\nmandate\u201d of the federal Medicaid statute, and is therefore\npreempted.Ante,at 7 (quotingPLIVA, Inc.v.Mensing, 564 U.\u00a0S. __, __ (2011) (slip op., at 11)\n(internal quotation marks omitted)), 10. This reflects a basic\npolicy judgment: that segregating medical expenses from a lump-sum\nrecovery must be done on a case-specific, after-the-fact basis,\nrather than pursuant to a general rule spelled out in advance.The problem is that the Court can point to no\nstatutory or regulatory requirement, much less an unambiguous one,\nrequiring such an approach. The federal statute, which provides\nthat States must recoup medical expenses owed by third parties, and\nwhich prevents States from placing a lien on a beneficiary\u2019s\nproperty, says nothing about how to comply with these two\nrequirements in the event of a settlement. Seeante,at 1\n(Breyer, J., concurring) (\u201cThe statute is silent on the\nquestion\u201d).Nor does our case law. As the Court\nacknowledges, our decision inArkansas Dept. of Health and Human\nServs.v.Ahlborn, was an easy one.547 U.S.\n268(2006). There, the underlying tort suit settled for\n$550,000, and the Medicaid beneficiary and the State of Arkansas\nstipulated that only $35,581.47 of the settlement represented\nmedical expenses. The State nonetheless claimed it \u201cwas entitled to\na lien in the amount of $215,645.30\u201d\u2014i.e.,the total amount\npaid by the State for the beneficiary\u2019s health care.Id., at\n274. The question was whether the State could demand this money in\nlight of its stipulation that only $35,581.47 reflected medical\nexpenses. The answer, of course, was no. The State is only entitled\nto recover medical expenses; nothing else. So when Arkansas\ncontended that it was entitled to money the beneficiary had\nreceived for something other than medical expenses, we had no\ntrouble rejecting that argument. That proposition\u2014that States may\nnot take money that is unrelated to medical expenses\u2014does not help\nanswer the question here: May a State condition Medicaid benefits\non a beneficiary agreeing to define one-third of a tort recovery as\nreflecting \u201cmedical expenses\u201d?The Court recognizes thatAhlborn\u201chad no\noccasion to resolve\u201d the question \u201chow to determine what portion of\na settlement represents payment for medical care,\u201dante,at\n5, but then promptly proceeds as ifAhlbornhad done just\nthat. The Court quotesAhlbornfor the proposition that a\nState may not claim any portion of a tort recovery \u201cnot \u2018designated\nas payments for medical care,\u2019\u00a0\u201d and then faults North\nCarolina\u2019s law because it \u201csets forth no process for determining\nwhat portion\u201d is \u201cattributable to med-ical expenses.\u201dAnte,at 6, 7 (quoting 547 U.\u00a0S., at 284), 7.Ahlbornspoke\nof \u201cdesignated\u201d amounts because, as noted, there was a stipulated\ndesignation in that case. What to do when there is no such\nstipulation\u2014when it\u2019s not clear \u201cwhat portion of a settlement\nrepresents payment for medical care\u201d\u2014is a different question. The\nCourt assumes the answer must be the same: that the settlement must\nbe parsed in every case, so that there is an actual, after-the-fact\ndesignation in every case. If the parties do not agree on one, as\nthey did inAhlborn, there must be a process in place for\nreaching a case-specific attribution.The nature of the \u201cprocess\u201d contemplated by the\nmajor- ity is unclear, but it must involve an effort to determine\nwhat claims would have succeeded had there been a trial, what the\ndamages would have been for the separate claims, and so on\u2014the very\nsort of inquiries settlement is intended to obviate. The Court\ntalks of addressing these concerns through \u201crebuttable presumptions\nand adjusted burdens of proof to ensure that speculative\nassessments of a plaintiff\u2019s likely recovery do not defeat the\nState\u2019s right to recover medical costs,\u201d but ominously declines to\ngive any assurance \u201cthat these rules are necessarily compliant with\nthe federal statute.\u201dAnte, at 13.Nothing inAhlbornrequires all this, and\nNorth Caro-lina has taken a different approach. It has adjusted its\ntort law to account for its obligations under federal Medicaid law\nby requiring that beneficiaries pay the State back in full or\ndesignate one-third of any recovery as \u201cmedical ex-penses,\u201d\nwhichever is less. This approach allows bene-ficiaries to obtain\nsettlements, \u201cmeet[s] concerns about settlement manipulation,\u201dAhlborn, supra,at 288, n.\u00a018, complies with the\nstatutory obligation that States make reasonable efforts to recover\nmedical expenses from liable third parties, and guarantees that the\nbeneficiary will never have to give back more than she has already\nreceived from the State.There\u2019s nothing unusual about such an approach.\nStates define the contours of their own tort law all the time,\nsetting rules about who may recover in particular circumstances,\nwhat claims may be alleged, which parties are liable, what defenses\nmay be asserted, what damages are recoverable, and so on. Doing so\ndoes not amount to imposing a lien on any property to which an\nindividual has a vested right under state tort law. The Court says\nNorth Carolina cannot rely on its \u201ctraditional authority to\nregulate tort actions\u201d because its rule in this case is not an\nexercise of its \u201cgeneral authority.\u201dAnte, at 11. The Court\ncites no support for this vague new limitation on a State\u2019s power\nto define tort remedies under state law, and I am aware of\nnone.In fact, federal law says nothing about how\nStates must define the recovery available to a Medicaid beneficiary\nsuing a third party. That silence is a good indication that\nCongress did not mean to strip States of their traditional\nauthority to regulate torts. SeeWyethv.Levine,555 U.S.\n555, 565 (2009) (\u201c[I]n all pre-emption cases, and particularly\nin those in which Congress has legislated in a field which the\nStates have traditionally occupied, we start with the assumption\nthat the historic police powers of the States were not to be\nsuperseded by the Federal Act unless that was the clear and\nmanifest purpose of Congress\u201d (internal quotation marks and\nellipses omitted)). The closest the Medicaid Act gets to this topic\nis its requirement that States have \u201cin effect laws under which\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. the State is considered to have acquired the rights\nof such individual to payment by any other party for such health\ncare items or services.\u201d See 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71396(a)(25)(H).\nThat Congress has said nothing else about what recovery a State\nmust allow, though clearly aware of the traditional power of States\nto regulate recoveries under private law, should be worth\nsomething. Cf.Bonito Boats, Inc.v.Thunder Craft Boats,\nInc.,489 U.S.\n141, 166\u2013167 (1989) (\u201cThe case for federal pre-emption is\nparticularly weak where Congress has indicated its awareness of the\noperation of state law in a field of federal interest, and has\nnonetheless decided to stand by both concepts and to tolerate\nwhatever tension there [is] between them\u201d (internal quotation marks\nomitted)).The majority nonetheless dismisses North\nCarolina\u2019s solution as an arbitrary \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d approach,ante, at 10, that has no \u201clogical\u201d endpoint; one that, if\naccepted, could permit States to \u201cdesignate half, three-quarters,\nor all of a tort recovery in the same way.\u201dAnte, at 8, 9.\nThis is an age-old objection to any line-drawing, to which Justice\nHolmes provided a familiar response: \u201cNeither are we troubled by\nthe question where to draw the line. That is the question in pretty\nmuch everything worth arguing in the law.\u201dIrwinv.Gavit,268 U.S.\n161, 168 (1925). Whatever the case \u201cas a doctrinal matter,\u201d it\nisin fact\u201ceasier to defend North Carolina\u2019s\u201d one-third\ndesignation than the Court\u2019s hypothetical where a State allocates\nall of a recovery to medical expenses.Ante, at 9. In\naddition, the majority\u2019s hobgoblin is less frightening when we\nremember that North Carolina never takes back more than what it\npaid for such expenses.The reasons for drawing a bright line, as North\nCarolina has, are obvious and familiar. See generally Scalia, The\nRule of Law as a Law of Rules, 56 U. Chi. L.\u00a0Rev. 1175 (1989).\nBright lines provide clear notice; here that means beneficiaries\nknow exactly where they stand with respect to reimbursing the State\nas they negotiate settlements with third parties. Such clear rules\nare easy, cheap, and administrable\u2014laudable qualities in the\ncontext of a vast and intricate program. The Court\u2019s approach, on\nthe other end, requires the time of lawyers and judges, and that\ntime costs money\u2014money better spent on providing health care to the\nneedy. Or so the State, responsible for administering its program,\ncould conclude, and nothing in the statute, regulations, or our\nprecedent says otherwise.The majority points out that nearly one-third of\nthe States conduct hearings of the sort it contemplates.Ante,at 13. Good for them. The whole point of our federal\nsystem is that different States may reach different judgments about\nhow to run their own different programs. Such flexibility is\nparticularly important in this context, where Medicaid spending is\nthe largest component of most state budgets. The Court also notes\nthat, in other areas, courts have undertaken the work of\n\u201cseparat[ing] lump-sum settlements or jury awards into categories\nto satisfy different claims.\u201dIbid.My point is not that the\nwork required by the Court cannot be done\u2014just that it has not been\nrequired by Congress or the Secretary.On that note, it\u2019s bad enough that the Court\nfinds the State\u2019s reasonable effort to reconcile its competing\nobligations preempted. What is doubly unfortunate is that the\nCourt\u2019s analysis necessarily implies that the Secretary\u2019s hands are\nalso tied. The Medicaid Act is Spending Clause legislation, and\nsuch legislation is binding on States only insofar as it is\n\u201cunambiguous.\u201d SeePennhurst State School and Hospitalv.Halderman,451 U.S.\n1, 17 (1981). In addition, the anti-lien provision only\nprecludes North Carolina\u2019s law if, as the Court acknowledges, there\nis a \u201cdirect conflict\u201d between the two.Ante,at 7 (quotingPLIVA, Inc., 564 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 11)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). The Court says\u2014wrongly, I\nbelieve\u2014that there is.Ante, at 10 (\u201cAn irrebuttable,\none-size-fits-all statutory presumption is incompatible with the\nMedicaid Act\u2019sclear mandatethat a State may not demand any\nportion of a beneficiary\u2019s tort recovery except the share that is\nattributable to medical expenses\u201d (emphasis added)). But if North\nCarolina\u2019s approach directly conflicts with an unambiguous, clear\nmandate in the Act\u2014such that any presumption against preemption is\novercome, seeWyeth, supra,at 565, n.\u00a03\u2014it\u2019s hard to\nsee how the Secretary could adopt a similar approach. SeeChevron U.\u00a0S.\u00a0A. Inc.v.Natural Resources\nDefense Council, Inc.,467 U.S.\n837, 842\u2013843 (1984) (\u201cIf the intent of Congress is clear, that\nis the end of the matter; for the court, as well as the agency,\nmust give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of\nCongress\u201d).The concurrence wishes this were not so, seeante, at 4 (\u201ctoday\u2019s decision does not freeze the Court\u2019s\npresent interpretation of the statute permanently into law\u201d), but\nfails to acknowledge the express rationale of the Court\u2019s opinion.\nThere is no other way to read the majority opinion than as\nforeclosing what the concurrence would like to leave open.Or is there? In exactly two sentences, the Court\nseems to falter and lose the courage of its conviction that a State\nmust have a process in place for an individual allocation of\nmedical expenses in every case. The Court views the problem with\nNorth Carolina\u2019s law as being that \u201cthe State provides no evidence\nto substantiate its claim that the one-third allocation is\nreasonable in the mine run of cases.\u201dAnte, at 9. That\nthought does not resurface until five pages later\u2014and only\nthen\u2014when the Court says that States \u201cmay even be able to adoptex anteadministrative criteria for allocating medical and\nnonmedical expenses, provided these criteria are backed by evidence\nsuggesting that they are likely to yield reasonable results in the\nmine run of cases.\u201dAnte, at 14.I am not sure whether this is a concession that\nindividualized hearings may not be required after all, but if it\nis, it is flatly contrary to the rest of the opinion. It is also\nquite odd to suggest that the problem with North Caro-lina\u2019s law\nwould go away if only the State provided some sort of study\nsubstantiating the idea that one-third was a good approximation in\nmost cases. North Carolina is not a federal agency, whose actions\nare subject to review under the Administrative Procedure Act\u2019s\n\u201csubstantial evidence\u201d test. See 5 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7706(2)(E).\nWe have never before, in a preemption case, put the burden on the\nState to compile an evidentiary record supporting its legislative\ndetermination. The burden is, of course, on those challenging the\nlaw. SeePharmaceutical Research and Mfrs. of Americav.Walsh,538 U.S.\n644, 661\u2013662 (2003) (plurality opinion) (\u201cWe start\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. with a presumption that the state statute is valid,\nand ask whether petitioner has shouldered the burden of overcoming\nthat presumption\u201d (citation omitted)). We have said that, as a\ngeneral matter, \u201cCongress is not obligated, when enacting its\nstatutes, to make a record of the type that an administrative\nagency or court does to accommodate judicial review.\u201dTurner\nBroadcasting System, Inc.v.FCC,520 U.S.\n180, 213 (1997) (internal quotation marks omitted). Sovereign\nStates should be accorded no less deference.Keep in mind that the basis for all this is a\nfederal law that prohibits liens for medical assistance, but saysnothingabout how medical and nonmedical expenses are to be\nallocated. It is hard enough to figure out what the Medicaid Act\nmeans by what itsays; we should not read so much into its\nsilence.Ultimately, it is a basic policy judgment\nwhether the Medicaid program is best served in this instance by\npost\u00a0hoc individualized determinations, or whether the issue\nmay be addressed in advance, through a general rule, as North\nCarolina has done here. Seeante, at 1\u20132 (Breyer, J.,\nconcurring) (\u201cany of several different answers to the question\nwould seem reasonable\u201d). The Court can point to nothing that\ndelegates to it the prerogative to make that judgment. Rather,\nStates and the Secretary\u2014working together\u2014should be afforded the\nleeway to make their joint venture a workable one.Because North Carolina\u2019s law does not conflict\nwith federal law, I would let it be. I respectfully dissent.",
