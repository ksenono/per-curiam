KRISTIN M. PERRY et\u00a0al.on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the ninth circuit[June 26, 2013]Chief Justice Roberts\ndelivered the opinion of the Court.The public is currently\nengaged in an active political debate over whether same-sex couples\nshould be allowed to marry. That question has also given rise to\nlitigation. In this case, petitioners, who oppose same-sex\nmarriage, ask us to decide whether the Equal Protection Clause\n\u201cprohibits the State of California from defining marriage as\nthe union of a man and a woman.\u201d Pet. for Cert. i.\nRespondents, same-sex couples who wish to marry, view the issue in\nsomewhat different terms: For them, it is whether\nCalifornia\u2014having previously recognized the right of same-sex\ncouples to marry\u2014may reverse that decision through a\nreferendum.Federal courts have\nauthority under the Constitution to answer such questions only if\nnecessary to do so in the course of deciding an actual\n\u201ccase\u201d or \u201ccontroversy.\u201d As used in the\nConstitution, those words do not include every sort of dispute, but\nonly those \u201chistorically viewed as capable of resolution\nthrough the judicial process.\u201d Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.\u00a0S.\n83, 95 (1968) . This is an essential limit on our power: It ensures\nthat we act as judges, and do not engage in policymaking properly\nleft to elected representatives.For there to be such a\ncase or controversy, it is not enough that the party invoking the\npower of the court have a keen interest in the issue. That party\nmust also have \u201cstanding,\u201d which requires, among other\nthings, that it have suffered a concrete and particularized injury.\nBecause we find that petitioners do not have standing, we have no\nauthority to decide this case on the merits, and neither did the\nNinth Circuit.IIn 2008, the\nCalifornia Supreme Court held that limiting the official\ndesignation of marriage to opposite-sex couples violated the equal\nprotection clause of the California Constitution. In\u00a0re\nMarriage Cases, 43 Cal. 4th 757, 183 P.\u00a03d 384. Later that\nyear, California voters passed the ballot initiative at the center\nof this dispute, known as Proposition 8. That proposition amended\nthe California Constitution to provide that \u201c[o]nly marriage\nbetween a man and a woman is valid or recognized in\nCalifornia.\u201d Cal. Const., Art. I, \u00a77.5. Shortly\nthereafter, the California Supreme Court rejected a procedural\nchallenge to the amendment, and held that the Proposition was\nproperly enacted under California law. Strauss v. Horton, 46 Cal.\n4th 364, 474\u2013475, 207 P.\u00a03d 48, 122 (2009).According to the\nCalifornia Supreme Court, Proposition 8 created a \u201cnarrow and\nlimited exception\u201d to the state constitutional rights\notherwise guaranteed to same-sex couples. Id., at 388, 207\nP.\u00a03d, at 61. Under California law, same-sex couples have a\nright to enter into relationships recognized by the State as\n\u201cdomestic partnerships,\u201d which carry \u201cthe same\nrights, protections, and benefits, and shall be subject to the same\nresponsibilities, obligations, and duties under law .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nas are granted to and imposed upon spouses.\u201d Cal. Fam. Code\nAnn. \u00a7297.5(a) (West 2004). In In\u00a0re Marriage Cases, the\nCalifornia Supreme Court concluded that the California Constitution\nfurther guarantees same-sex couples \u201call of the\nconstitutionally based incidents of marriage,\u201d including the\nright to have that marriage \u201cofficially recognized\u201d as\nsuch by the State. 43 Cal. 4th, at 829, 183 P.\u00a03d, at\n433\u2013434. Proposition 8, the court explained in Strauss, left\nthose rights largely undisturbed, reserving only \u201cthe\nofficial designation of the term \u2018marriage\u2019 for the\nunion of opposite-sex couples as a matter of state constitutional\nlaw.\u201d 46 Cal. 4th, at 388, 207 P.\u00a03d, at 61.Respondents, two\nsame-sex couples who wish to marry, filed suit in federal court,\nchallenging Proposition 8 under the Due Process and Equal\nProtection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal\nConstitution. The complaint named as defendants California\u2019s\nGovernor, attorney general, and various other state and local\nofficials responsible for enforcing California\u2019s marriage\nlaws. Those officials refused to defend the law, although they have\ncontinued to enforce it throughout this litigation. The District\nCourt allowed petitioners\u2014the official proponents of the\ninitiative, see Cal. Elec. Code Ann. \u00a7342 (West 2003)\u2014to\nintervene to defend it. After a 12-day bench trial, the District\nCourt declared Proposition 8 uncon-stitutional, permanently\nenjoining the California officials named as defendants from\nenforcing the law, and \u201cdirecting the official defendants\nthat all persons under their control or supervision\u201d shall\nnot enforce it. Perry v. Schwarzenegger, 704 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d 921,\n1004 (ND Cal. 2010).Those officials elected\nnot to appeal the District Court order. When petitioners did, the\nNinth Circuit asked them to address \u201cwhy this appeal should\nnot be dismissed for lack of Article III standing.\u201d Perry v.\nSchwarzenegger, Civ. No. 10\u201316696 (CA9, Aug. 16, 2010),\np.\u00a02. After briefing and argument, the Ninth Circuit certified\na question to the California Supreme Court:\u201cWhether under Article II, Section 8\nof the California Constitution, or otherwise under California law,\nthe official proponents of an initiative measure possess either a\nparticularized interest in the initiative\u2019s valid-ity or the\nauthority to assert the State\u2019s interest in the\ninitiative\u2019s validity, which would enable them to defend the\nconstitutionality of the initiative upon its adoption or appeal a\njudgment invalidating the initiative, when the public officials\ncharged with that duty refuse to do so.\u201d Perry v.\nSchwarzenegger, 628 F.\u00a03d 1191, 1193 (2011).The California Supreme\nCourt agreed to decide the certified question, and answered in the\naffirmative. Without addressing whether the proponents have a\nparticularized interest of their own in an initiative\u2019s\nvalidity, the court concluded that \u201c[i]n a postelection\nchallenge to a voter-approved initiative measure, the official\nproponents of the initiative are authorized under California law to\nappear and assert the state\u2019s interest in the\ninitiative\u2019s validity and to appeal a judgment invalidating\nthe measure when the public officials who ordinarily defend the\nmeasure or appeal such a judgment decline to do so.\u201d Perry v.\nBrown, 52 Cal. 4th 1116, 1127, 265 P.\u00a03d 1002, 1007\n(2011).Relying on that answer,\nthe Ninth Circuit concluded that petitioners had standing under\nfederal law to defend the constitutionality of Proposition 8.\nCalifornia, it reasoned, \u201c\u00a0\u2018has standing to defend\nthe constitutionality of its [laws],\u2019\u00a0\u201d and States\nhave the \u201cprerogative, as independent sovereigns, to decide\nfor themselves who may assert their interests.\u201d Perry v.\nBrown, 671 F.\u00a03d 1052, 1070, 1071 (2012) (quoting Diamond v.\nCharles, 476 U.\u00a0S. 54, 62 (1986) ). \u201cAll a federal court\nneed determine is that the state has suffered a harm sufficient to\nconfer standing and that the party seeking to invoke the\njurisdiction of the court is authorized by the state to represent\nits interest in remedying that harm.\u201d 671 F.\u00a03d, at\n1072.On the merits, the\nNinth Circuit affirmed the District Court. The court held the\nProposition unconstitutional under the rationale of our decision in\nRomer v. Evans, 517 U.\u00a0S. 620 (1996) . 671 F.\u00a03d, at\n1076, 1095. In the Ninth Circuit\u2019s view, Romer stands for the\nproposition that \u201cthe Equal Protection Clause requires the\nstate to have a legitimate reason for withdrawing a right or\nbenefit from one group but not others, whether or not it was\nrequired to confer that right or benefit in the first place.\u201d\n671 F.\u00a03d, at 1083\u20131084. The Ninth Circuit concluded\nthat \u201ctaking away the official designation\u201d of\n\u201cmarriage\u201d from same-sex couples, while continuing to\nafford those couples all the rights and obligations of marriage,\ndid not further any legitimate interest of the State. Id., at 1095.\nProposition 8, in the court\u2019s view, violated the Equal\nProtection Clause because it served no purpose \u201cbut to impose\non gays and lesbians, through the public law, a majority\u2019s\nprivate disapproval of them and their relationships.\u201d\nIbid.We granted certiorari\nto review that determination, and directed that the parties also\nbrief and argue \u201cWhether petitioners have standing under\nArticle III, \u00a72, of the Constitution in this case.\u201d 568\nU.\u00a0S. ___ (2012).IIArticle III of the\nConstitution confines the judicial power of federal courts to\ndeciding actual \u201cCases\u201d or \u201cControversies.\u201d\n\u00a72. One essential aspect of this requirement is that any\nperson invoking the power of a federal court must demonstrate\nstanding to do so. This requires the litigant to prove that he has\nsuffered a concrete and particularized injury that is fairly\ntraceable to the challenged conduct, and is likely to be redressed\nby a favorable judicial decision. Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife,\n504 U.\u00a0S. 555 \u2013561 (1992). In other words, for a federal\ncourt to have authority under the Constitution to settle a dispute,\nthe party before it must seek a remedy for a personal and tangible\nharm. \u201cThe presence of a disagreement, however sharp and\nacrimonious it may be, is insufficient by itself to meet Art.\nIII\u2019s requirements.\u201d Diamond, supra, at 62.The doctrine of\nstanding, we recently explained, \u201cserves to prevent the\njudicial process from being used to usurp the powers of the\npolitical branches.\u201d Clapper v. Amnesty Int\u2019l USA, 568\nU.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 9). In light of this\n\u201coverriding and time-honored concern about keeping the\nJudiciary\u2019s power within its proper constitu- tional sphere,\nwe must put aside the natural urge to proceed directly to the\nmerits of [an] important dispute and to \u2018settle\u2019 it for\nthe sake of convenience and effi-ciency.\u201d Raines v. Byrd, 521\nU.\u00a0S. 811, 820 (1997) (footnote omitted).Most standing cases\nconsider whether a plaintiff has satisfied the requirement when\nfiling suit, but Article III demands that an \u201cactual\ncontroversy\u201d persist throughout all stages of litigation.\nAlready, LLC v. Nike, Inc., 568 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip\nop., at 4) (internal quotation marks omitted). That means that\nstanding \u201cmust be met by persons seeking appellate review,\njust as it must be met by persons appearing in courts of first\ninstance.\u201d Arizonans for Official English v. Arizona, 520\nU.\u00a0S. 43, 64 (1997) . We therefore must decide whether\npetitioners had standing to appeal the District Court\u2019s\norder.Respondents initiated\nthis case in the District Court against the California officials\nresponsible for enforcing Proposition 8. The parties do not contest\nthat respondents had Article III standing to do so. Each couple\nexpressed a desire to marry and obtain \u201cofficial\nsanction\u201d from the State, which was unavailable to them given\nthe declaration in Proposition 8 that \u201cmarriage\u201d in\nCalifornia is solely between a man and a woman. App. 59.After the District\nCourt declared Proposition 8 unconstitutional and enjoined the\nstate officials named as defendants from enforcing it, however, the\ninquiry under Article III changed. Respondents no longer had any\ninjury to redress\u2014they had won\u2014and the state officials\nchose not to appeal.The only individuals\nwho sought to appeal that order were petitioners, who had\nintervened in the District Court. But the District Court had not\nordered them to do or refrain from doing anything. To have\nstanding, a litigant must seek relief for an injury that affects\nhim in a \u201cpersonal and individual way.\u201d Defenders of\nWildlife, supra, at 560, n.\u00a01. He must possess a \u201cdirect\nstake in the outcome\u201d of the case. Arizonans for Official\nEnglish, supra, at 64 (internal quotation marks omitted). Here,\nhowever, petitioners had no \u201cdirect stake\u201d in the\noutcome of their appeal. Their only interest in having the District\nCourt order reversed was to vindicate the constitutional validity\nof a generally applicable California law.We have repeatedly held\nthat such a \u201cgeneralized grievance,\u201d no matter how\nsincere, is insufficient to confer standing. A litigant\n\u201craising only a generally available grievance about\ngovernment\u2014claiming only harm to his and every\ncitizen\u2019s interest in proper application of the Constitution\nand laws, and seeking relief that no more directly and tangibly\nbenefits him than it does the public at large\u2014does not state\nan Article III case or controversy.\u201d Defenders of Wildlife,\nsupra, at 573\u2013574; see Lance v. Coffman, 549 U.\u00a0S. 437,\n439 (2007) (per curiam) (\u201cOur refusal to serve as a forum for\ngeneralized grievances has a lengthy pedigree.\u201d); Allen v.\nWright, 468 U.\u00a0S. 737, 754 (1984) (\u201can asserted right to\nhave the Government act in accordance with law is not sufficient,\nstanding alone, to confer jurisdiction on a federal court\u201d);\nMassachusetts v. Mellon, 262 U.\u00a0S. 447, 488 (1923) (\u201cThe\nparty who invokes the [judicial] power must be able to show\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. that he has sustained or is immediately in danger\nof sustaining some direct injury .\u00a0.\u00a0. and not merely\nthat he suffers in some indefinite way in common with people\ngenerally.\u201d).Petitioners argue that\nthe California Constitution and its election laws give them a\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018unique,\u2019 \u2018special,\u2019 and\n\u2018distinct\u2019 role in the initiative process\u2014one\n\u2018involving both authority and responsibilities that differ\nfrom other supporters of the measure.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Reply\nBrief 5 (quoting 52 Cal. 4th, at 1126, 1142, 1160, 265 P.\u00a03d,\nat 1006, 1017\u20131018, 1030). True enough\u2014but only when it\ncomes to the process of enacting the law. Upon submitting the\nproposed initiative to the attorney general, petitioners became the\nofficial \u201cproponents\u201d of Proposition 8. Cal. Elec. Code\nAnn. \u00a7342 (West 2003). As such, they were responsible for\ncollecting the signatures required to qualify the measure for the\nballot. \u00a7\u00a79607\u20139609. After those signatures were\ncollected, the proponents alone had the right to file the measure\nwith election officials to put it on the ballot. \u00a79032.\nPetitioners also possessed control over the arguments in favor of\nthe initiative that would appear in California\u2019s ballot\npamphlets. \u00a7\u00a79064, 9065, 9067, 9069.But once Proposition 8\nwas approved by the voters, the measure became \u201ca duly\nenacted constitutional amendment or statute.\u201d 52 Cal. 4th, at\n1147, 265 P.\u00a03d, at 1021. Petitioners have no\nrole\u2014special or otherwise\u2014in the enforcement of\nProposition 8. See id., at 1159, 265 P.\u00a03d, at 1029\n(petitioners do not \u201cpossess any official authority\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. to directly enforce the initiative measure in\nquestion\u201d). They therefore have no \u201cpersonal\nstake\u201d in defending its enforcement that is distinguishable\nfrom the general interest of every citizen of California. Defenders\nof Wildlife, supra, at 560\u2013561.Article III standing\n\u201cis not to be placed in the hands of \u2018concerned\nbystanders,\u2019 who will use it simply as a \u2018vehicle for\nthe vindication of value interests.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Diamond,\n476 U.\u00a0S., at 62. No matter how deeply committed petitioners\nmay be to upholding Proposition 8 or how \u201czealous [their]\nadvocacy,\u201d post, at 4 (Kennedy, J., dissenting), that is not\na \u201cparticularized\u201d interest sufficient to create a case\nor controversy under Article III. Defenders of Wildlife, 504\nU.\u00a0S., at 560, and n.\u00a01; see Arizonans for Official\nEnglish, 520 U.\u00a0S., at 65 (\u201cNor has this Court ever\nidentified ini-tiative proponents as Article-III-qualified\ndefenders of the measures they advocated.\u201d); Don\u2019t\nBankrupt Washington Committee v. Continental Ill. Nat. Bank &\nTrust Co. of Chicago, 460 U.\u00a0S. 1077 (1983) (summarily\ndismissing, for lack of standing, appeal by an initiative proponent\nfrom a decision holding the initiative unconstitutional).IIIAWithout a judicially\ncognizable interest of their own, petitioners attempt to invoke\nthat of someone else. They assert that even if they have no\ncognizable interest in appealing the District Court\u2019s\njudgment, the State of California does, and they may assert that\ninterest on the State\u2019s behalf. It is, however, a\n\u201cfundamental restriction on our authority\u201d that\n\u201c[i]n the ordinary course, a litigant must assert his or her\nown legal rights and interests, and cannot rest a claim to relief\non the legal rights or inter-ests of third parties.\u201d Powers\nv. Ohio, 499 U.\u00a0S. 400, 410 (1991) . There are \u201ccertain,\nlimited exceptions\u201d to that rule. Ibid. But even when we have\nallowed litigants to assert the interests of others, the litigants\nthemselves still \u201cmust have suffered an injury in fact, thus\ngiving [them] a sufficiently concrete interest in the outcome of\nthe issue in dispute.\u201d Id., at 411 (internal quotation marks\nomitted).In Diamond v. Charles,\nfor example, we refused to allow Diamond, a pediatrician engaged in\nprivate practice in Illinois, to defend the constitutionality of\nthe State\u2019s abortion law. In that case, a group of physicians\nfiled a con-stitutional challenge to the Illinois statute in\nfederal court. The State initially defended the law, and Diamond, a\nprofessed \u201cconscientious object[or] to abortions,\u201d\nin-tervened to defend it alongside the State. 476 U.\u00a0S., at\n57\u201358.After the Seventh\nCircuit affirmed a permanent injunction against enforcing several\nprovisions of the law, the State chose not to pursue an appeal to\nthis Court. But when Diamond did, the state attorney general filed\na \u201c\u00a0\u2018letter of interest,\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nexplaining that the State\u2019s interest in the proceeding was\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018essentially co-terminous with the position on\nthe issues set forth by [Diamond].\u2019\u00a0\u201d Id., at 61.\nThat was not enough, we held, to allow the appeal to proceed. As\nthe Court explained, \u201c[e]ven if there were cir-cumstances in\nwhich a private party would have stand- ing to defend the\nconstitutionality of a challenged statute, this [was] not one of\nthem,\u201d because Diamond was not able to assert an injury in\nfact of his own. Id., at 65 (footnote omitted). And without\n\u201cany judicially cognizable interest,\u201d Diamond could not\n\u201cmaintain the litigation abandoned by the State.\u201d Id.,\nat 71.For the reasons we have\nexplained, petitioners have likewise not suffered an injury in\nfact, and therefore would ordinarily have no standing to assert the\nState\u2019s interests.BPetitioners contend\nthat this case is different, because the California Supreme Court\nhas determined that they are \u201cauthorized under California law\nto appear and assert the state\u2019s interest\u201d in the\nvalidity of Proposition 8. 52 Cal. 4th, at 1127, 265 P.\u00a03d, at\n1007. The court below agreed: \u201cAll a federal court need\ndetermine is that the state has suffered a harm sufficient to\nconfer standing and that the party seeking to invoke the\njurisdiction of the court is authorized by the state to represent\nits interest in remedying that harm.\u201d 671 F.\u00a03d, at\n1072. As petitioners put it, they \u201cneed no more show a\npersonal injury, separate from the State\u2019s indisputable\ninterest in the validity of its law, than would California\u2019s\nAttorney General or did the legislative leaders held to have\nstanding in Karcher v. May, 484 U.\u00a0S. 72 (1987) .\u201d Reply\nBrief 6.In Karcher, we held\nthat two New Jersey state legis-lators\u2014Speaker of the General\nAssembly Alan Karcher and President of the Senate Carmen\nOrechio\u2014could intervene in a suit against the State to defend\nthe constitutionality of a New Jersey law, after the New Jersey\nattorney general had declined to do so. 484 U.\u00a0S., at 75,\n81\u201382. \u201cSince the New Jersey Legislature had authority\nunder state law to represent the State\u2019s interests in both\nthe District Court and the Court of Appeals,\u201d we held that\nthe Speaker and the President, in their official capacities, could\nvindicate that interest in federal court on the legislature\u2019s\nbehalf. Id., at 82.Far from supporting\npetitioners\u2019 standing, however, Karcher is compelling\nprecedent against it. The legislators in that case intervened in\ntheir official capacities as Speaker and President of the\nlegislature. No one doubts that a State has a cognizable interest\n\u201cin the continued enforceability\u201d of its laws that is\nharmed by a judicial decision declaring a state law\nunconstitutional. Maine v. Taylor, 477 U.\u00a0S. 131, 137 (1986) .\nTo vindicate that interest or any other, a State must be able to\ndesignate agents to represent it in federal court. See Poindexter\nv. Greenhow, 114 U.\u00a0S. 270, 288 (1885) (\u201cThe State is a\npolitical corporate body [that] can act only through\nagents\u201d). That agent is typically the State\u2019s attorney\ngeneral. But state law may provide for other officials to speak for\nthe State in federal court, as New Jersey law did for the\nState\u2019s presiding legislative officers in Karcher. See 484\nU.\u00a0S., at 81\u201382.What is significant\nabout Karcher is what happened after the Court of Appeals decision\nin that case. Karcher and Orechio lost their positions as Speaker\nand President, but nevertheless sought to appeal to this Court. We\nheld that they could not do so. We explained that while they were\nable to participate in the lawsuit in their official capacities as\npresiding officers of the incumbent legislature, \u201csince they\nno longer hold those offices, they lack authority to pursue this\nappeal.\u201d Id., at 81.The point of Karcher is\nnot that a State could authorize private parties to represent its\ninterests; Karcher and Orechio were permitted to proceed only\nbecause they were state officers, acting in an official capacity.\nAs soon as they lost that capacity, they lost standing. Petitioners\nhere hold no office and have always participated in this litigation\nsolely as private parties.The cases relied upon\nby the dissent, see post, at 11\u201312, provide petitioners no\nmore support. The dissent\u2019s primary authorities, in fact, do\nnot discuss standing at all. See Young v. United States ex rel.\nVuitton et Fils S. A., 481 U.\u00a0S. 787 (1987) ; United States v.\nProvidence Journal Co., 485 U.\u00a0S. 693 (1988) . And none comes\nclose to establishing that mere authorization to represent a third\nparty\u2019s interests is sufficient to confer Article III\nstanding on private parties with no injury of their own.The dissent highlights\nthe discretion exercised by special prosecutors appointed by\nfederal courts to pursue contempt charges. See post, at 11 (citing\nYoung, supra, at 807). Such prosecutors do enjoy a degree of\nindependence in carrying out their appointed role, but no one would\nsuppose that they are not subject to the ultimate au-thority of the\ncourt that appointed them. See also Prov-idence Journal, supra, at\n698\u2013707 (recognizing further control exercised by the\nSolicitor General over special prosecutors).The dissent\u2019s\nremaining cases, which at least consider standing, are readily\ndistinguishable. See Vermont Agency of Natural Resources v. United\nStates ex rel. Stevens, 529 U. S. 765 \u2013778 (2000) (justifying\nqui tam actions based on a partial assignment of the\nGovernment\u2019s damages claim and a \u201cwell nigh\nconclusive\u201d tradition of such actions in English and American\ncourts dating back to the 13th century); Whitmore v. Arkansas, 495\nU. S. 149 \u2013164 (1989) (justifying \u201cnext friend\u201d\nstanding based on a similar history dating back to the 17th\ncentury, requiring the next friend to prove a disability of the\nreal party in interest and a \u201csignificant relationship\u201d\nwith that party); Gollust v. Mendell, 501 U.\u00a0S. 115 \u2013125\n(1990) (requiring plaintiff in shareholder-derivative suit to\nmaintain a financial stake in the outcome of the litigation, to\navoid \u201cserious constitutional doubt whether that plaintiff\ncould demonstrate the standing required by Article III\u2019s\ncase-or-controversy limitation\u201d).CBoth petitioners and\nrespondents seek support from dicta in Arizonans for Official\nEnglish v. Arizona, 520 U.\u00a0S. 43 . The plaintiff in Arizonans\nfor Official English filed a constitutional challenge to an Arizona\nballot initiative declaring English \u201c\u00a0\u2018the\nofficial language of the State of Arizona.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Id.,\nat 48. After the District Court declared the initiative\nunconstitutional, Arizona\u2019s Governor announced that she would\nnot pursue an appeal. Instead, the principal sponsor of the ballot\ninitiative\u2014the Arizonans for Official English\nCommittee\u2014sought to defend the measure in the Ninth Circuit.\nId., at 55\u201356, 58. Analogizing the sponsors to the Arizona\nLegislature, the Ninth Circuit held that the Committee was\n\u201cqualified to defend [the initiative] on appeal,\u201d and\naffirmed the District Court. Id., at 58, 61.Before finding the case\nmooted by other events, this Court expressed \u201cgrave\ndoubts\u201d about the Ninth Circuit\u2019s standing analysis.\nId., at 66. We reiterated that \u201c[s]tanding to defend on\nappeal in the place of an original defendant .\u00a0.\u00a0.\ndemands that the litigant possess \u2018a direct stake in the\noutcome.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Id., at 64 (quoting Diamond, 476\nU.\u00a0S., at 62). We recognized that a legislator authorized by\nstate law to represent the State\u2019s interest may satisfy\nstanding requirements, as in Karcher, supra, at 82, but noted that\nthe Arizona committee and its members were \u201cnot elected\nrepresentatives, and we [we]re aware of no Arizona law appointing\ninitiative sponsors as agents of the people of Arizona to defend,\nin lieu of public officials, the constitutionality of initiatives\nmade law of the State.\u201d Arizonans for Official English,\nsupra, at 65.Petitioners argue that,\nby virtue of the California Supreme Court\u2019s decision, they\nare authorized to act \u201c\u00a0\u2018as agents of the\npeople\u2019 of California.\u201d Brief for Petitioners 15\n(quoting Arizonans for Official English, supra, at 65). But that\nCourt never described petitioners as \u201cagents of the\npeople,\u201d or of anyone else. Nor did the Ninth Circuit. The\nNinth Circuit asked\u2014and the California Supreme Court\nanswered\u2014only whether petitioners had \u201cthe authority to\nassert the State\u2019s interest in the initiative\u2019s\nvalidity.\u201d 628 F.\u00a03d, at 1193; 52 Cal. 4th, at 1124, 265\nP.\u00a03d, at 1005. All that the California Supreme Court decision\nstands for is that, so far as California is concerned, petitioners\nmay argue in defense of Proposition 8. This \u201cdoes not mean\nthat the proponents become de\u00a0facto public officials\u201d;\nthe authority they enjoy is \u201csimply the authority to\nparticipate as parties in a court action and to assert legal\narguments in defense of the state\u2019s interest in the validity\nof the initiative measure.\u201d Id., at 1159, 265 P.\u00a03d, at\n1029. That interest is by definition a generalized one, and it is\nprecisely because proponents assert such an interest that they lack\nstanding under our precedents.And petitioners are\nplainly not agents of the State\u2014\u201cformal\u201d or\notherwise, see post, at 7. As an initial matter, petitioners\u2019\nnewfound claim of agency is inconsistent with their representations\nto the District Court. When the proponents sought to intervene in\nthis case, they did not purport to be agents of California. They\nargued instead that \u201cno other party in this case w[ould]\nadequately rep-resent their interests as official\nproponents.\u201d Motion to Intervene in No. 09\u20132292 (ND\nCal.), p. 6 (emphasis added). It was their \u201cunique legal\nstatus\u201d as official proponents\u2014not an agency\nrelationship with the people of California\u2014that petitioners\nclaimed \u201cendow[ed] them with a significantly protectable\ninterest\u201d in ensuring that the District Court not\n\u201cundo[ ] all that they ha[d] done in obtaining\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. enactment\u201d of Proposition 8. Id., at 10,\n11.More to the point, the\nmost basic features of an agency relationship are missing here.\nAgency requires more than mere authorization to assert a particular\ninterest. \u201cAn essential element of agency is the\nprincipal\u2019s right to control the agent\u2019s\nactions.\u201d 1 Restatement (Third) of Agency \u00a71.01, Comment\nf (2005) (hereinafter Restatement). Yet petitioners answer to no\none; they decide for themselves, with no review, what arguments to\nmake and how to make them. Unlike California\u2019s attorney\ngeneral, they are not elected at regular intervals\u2014or elected\nat all. See Cal. Const., Art. V, \u00a711. No provision provides\nfor their removal. As one amicus explains, \u201cthe proponents\napparently have an unelected appointment for an unspecified period\nof time as defenders of the initiative, however and to whatever\nextent they choose to defend it.\u201d Brief for Walter Dellinger\n23.\u201cIf the\nrelationship between two persons is one of agency .\u00a0.\u00a0. ,\nthe agent owes a fiduciary obligation to the principal.\u201d 1\nRestatement \u00a71.01, Comment e. But petitioners owe nothing of\nthe sort to the people of California. Unlike California\u2019s\nelected officials, they have taken no oath of office. E.g., Cal.\nConst., Art. XX, \u00a73 (prescribing the oath for \u201call\npublic officers and employees, executive, legislative, and\njudicial\u201d). As the California Supreme Court explained,\npetitioners are bound simply by \u201cthe same ethical constraints\nthat apply to all other parties in a legal proceeding.\u201d 52\nCal. 4th, at 1159, 265 P.\u00a03d, at 1029. They are free to pursue\na purely ideological commit- ment to the law\u2019s\nconstitutionality without the need to take cognizance of resource\nconstraints, changes in public opinion, or potential ramifications\nfor other state priorities.Finally, the California\nSupreme Court stated that \u201c[t]he question of who should bear\nresponsibility for any attorney fee award .\u00a0.\u00a0. is\nentirely distinct from the question\u201d before it. Id., at 1161,\n265 P.\u00a03d, at 1031. (emphasis added). But it is hornbook law\nthat \u201ca principal has a duty to indem-nify the agent against\nexpenses and other losses incurred by the agent in defending\nagainst actions brought by third parties if the agent acted with\nactual authority in taking the action challenged by the third\nparty\u2019s suit.\u201d 2 Restatement \u00a78.14, Comment d. If\nthe issue of fees is entirely distinct from the authority question,\nthen authority cannot be based on agency.Neither the California\nSupreme Court nor the Ninth Circuit ever described the proponents\nas agents of the State, and they plainly do not qualify as\nsuch.IVThe dissent\neloquently recounts the California Supreme Court\u2019s reasons\nfor deciding that state law authorizes petitioners to defend\nProposition 8. See post, at 3\u20135. We do not \u201cdisrespect[\n]\u201d or \u201cdisparage[ ]\u201d those reasons. Post, at 12.\nNor do we question California\u2019s sovereign right to maintain\nan initiative process, or the right of initiative proponents to\ndefend their initiatives in California courts, where Article III\ndoes not apply. But as the dissent acknowledges, see post, at 1,\nstanding in federal court is a question of federal law, not state\nlaw. And no matter its reasons, the fact that a State thinks a\nprivate party should have standing to seek relief for a generalized\ngrievance cannot override our settled law to the contrary.The Article III\nrequirement that a party invoking the jurisdiction of a federal\ncourt seek relief for a personal, particularized injury serves\nvital interests going to the role of the Judiciary in our system of\nseparated powers. \u201cRefusing to entertain generalized\ngrievances ensures that .\u00a0.\u00a0. courts exercise power that\nis judicial in nature,\u201d Lance, 549 U.\u00a0S., at 441, and\nensures that the Federal Judiciary respects \u201cthe\nproper\u2014and properly limited\u2014role of the courts in a\ndemocratic society,\u201d DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, 547\nU.\u00a0S. 332, 341 (2006) (internal quotation marks omitted).\nStates cannot alter that role simply by issuing to private parties\nwho otherwise lack standing a ticket to the federal courthouse.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*We have never before\nupheld the standing of a private party to defend the\nconstitutionality of a state statute when state officials have\nchosen not to. We decline to do so for the first time here.Because petitioners\nhave not satisfied their burden to demonstrate standing to appeal\nthe judgment of the District Court, the Ninth Circuit was without\njurisdiction to consider the appeal. The judgment of the Ninth\nCircuit is vacated, and the case is remanded with instructions to\ndismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.It is so ordered.",
