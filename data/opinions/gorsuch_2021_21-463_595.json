We conclude that such an action is\npermissible against some of the named defendants but not\nothers.IEarlier this year Texas passed the Texas\nHeartbeat Act, 87th Leg., Reg. Sess., also known as\nS.\u00a0B.\u00a08. The Act prohibits physicians from \u201cknowingly\nperform[ing] or induc[ing] an abortion on a pregnant woman if the\nphysician detected a fetal heartbeat for the unborn child\u201d unless a\nmedical emergency prevents compliance. Tex. Health & Safety\nCode Ann. \u00a7\u00a7171.204(a), 171.205(a) (West Cum. Supp. 2021). But the\nlaw generally does not allow state officials to bring criminal\nprosecutions or civil enforcement actions. Instead,\nS.\u00a0B.\u00a08 directs enforcement \u201cthrough .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nprivate civil actions\u201d culminating in injunctions and statutory\ndamages awards against those who perform or assist prohibited\nabortions. \u00a7\u00a7171.207(a), 171.208(a)(2), (3). The law also provides\na defense. Tracking language fromPlanned Parenthood of\nSoutheastern Pa.v.Casey,505 U.S.\n833(1992), the statute permits abortion providers to defeat\nany suit against them by showing, among other things, that holding\nthem liable would place an \u201cundue burden\u201d on women seeking\nabortions. \u00a7\u00a7171.209(a)\u2013(b).[1]After the law\u2019s adoption, various abortion\nproviders sought to test its constitutionality. Not wishing to wait\nfor S.\u00a0B.\u00a08 actions in which they might raise their\narguments in defense, they filed their own pre-enforcement\nlawsuits. In all, they brought 14 such challenges in state court\nseeking, among other things, a declaration that S.\u00a0B.\u00a08\nis inconsistent with both the Federal and Texas Constitutions. A\nsummary judgment ruling in these now-consolidated cases arrived\nlast night, in which the abortion providers pre- vailed on certain\nof their claims.Van Steanv.Texas, No.\nD\u20131\u2013GN\u201321\u2013004179 (Dist. Ct. Travis Cty., Tex., Dec. 9, 2021).Another group of providers, including the\npetitioners before us, filed a pre-enforcement action in federal\ncourt. In their complaint, the petitioners alleged that\nS.\u00a0B.\u00a08 violates the Federal Constitution and sought an\ninjunction barring the following defendants from taking any action\nto enforce the statute: a state-court judge, Austin Jackson; a\nstate-court clerk, Penny Clarkston; Texas attorney general, Ken\nPaxton; executive director of the Texas Medical Board, Stephen\nCarlton; executive director of the Texas Board of Nursing,\nKatherine Thomas; executive director of the Texas Board of\nPharmacy, Allison Benz; executive commissioner of the Texas Health\nand Human Services Commission, Cecile Young; and a single private\nparty, Mark Lee Dickson.Shortly after the petitioners filed their\nfederal complaint, the individual defendants employed by Texas\nmoved to dismiss, citing among other things the doctrine of\nsovereign immunity. App. to Pet. for Cert. 3a. The sole private\ndefendant, Mr. Dickson, also moved to dismiss, claiming that the\npetitioners lacked standing to sue him. 13 F. 4th 434, 445 (CA5\n2021) (per\u00a0curiam). The District Court denied the\nmotions.Ibid.The defendants employed by Texas responded by\npursuing an interlocutory appeal in the Fifth Circuit under the\ncollateral order doctrine. SeePuerto RicoAqueduct and\nSewer Authorityv.Metcalf & Eddy,Inc.,506 U.S.\n139, 147 (1993) (collateral order doctrine allows immediate\nappellate review of order denying claim of sovereign immunity). Mr.\nDickson also filed an interlocutory appeal. The Fifth Circuit\nagreed to take up his appeal because the issues it raised\noverlapped with those already before the court in the Texas\nofficial defendants\u2019 appeal. 13 F. 4th, at 438\u2013439.Separately, the petitioners also sought relief\nfrom the Fifth Circuit. Citing S.\u00a0B.\u00a08\u2019s impending\neffective date, they asked the court to issue an injunction\nsuspending the law\u2019s enforcement until the court could hear and\ndecide the merits of the defendants\u2019 appeals.Ibid.The\nFifth Circuit declined the petitioners\u2019 request. Instead, that\ncourt issued an order staying proceedings in the District Court\nuntil it could resolve the defendants\u2019 appeals. App. to Pet. for\nCert. 79a; 13 F. 4th, at 438\u2013439, 443.In response to these developments, the\npetitioners sought emergency injunctive relief in this Court. In\ntheir filing, the petitioners asked us to enjoin any enforcement of\nS.\u00a0B.\u00a08. And given the statute\u2019s approaching effective\ndate, they asked us to rule within two days. The Court took up the\napplication and, in the abbreviated time available for review,\nconcluded that the petitioners\u2019 submission failed to identify a\nbasis in existing law sufficient to justify disturbing the Court of\nAppeals\u2019 decision denying injunctive relief.WholeWoman\u2019s Healthv.Jackson, 594 U.\u00a0S. ___\n(2021).After that ruling, the petitioners filed a\nsecond emergency request. This time they asked the Court to grant\ncertiorari before judgment to resolve the defendants\u2019 interlocutory\nappeals in the first instance, without awaiting the views of the\nFifth Circuit. This Court granted the petitioners\u2019 request and set\nthe case for expedited briefing and argument. 595 U.\u00a0S. ___\n(2021).IIBecause this Court granted certiorari before\njudgment, we effectively stand in the shoes of the Court of\nAppeals. SeeUnited Statesv.Nixon,418 U.S.\n683, 690\u2013692 (1974); S. Shapiro, K. Geller, T. Bishop, E.\nHartnett, D. Himmelfarb, Supreme Court Practice 2-11 (11th ed.\n2019). In this case, that means we must review the defendants\u2019\nappeals challenging the District Court\u2019s order denying their\nmotions to dismiss. As with any interlocutory appeal, our review is\nlimited to the particular orders under review and any other ruling\n\u201cinextricably intertwined with\u201d or \u201cnecessary to ensure meaningful\nreview of\u00a0\u201d them.Swintv.Chambers County\nComm\u2019n,514 U.S.\n35, 51 (1995). In this preliminary posture, the ultimate merits\nquestion\u2014whether S.\u00a0B.\u00a08 is consistent with the Federal\nConstitution\u2014is not before the Court. Nor is the wisdom of\nS.\u00a0B.\u00a08 as a matter of public policy.ATurning to the matters that are properly put\nto us, we begin with the sovereign immunity appeal involving the\nstate-court judge, Austin Jackson, and the state-court clerk, Penny\nClarkston. While this lawsuit names only one state-court judge and\none state-court clerk as defendants, the petitioners explain that\nthey hope eventually to win certification of a class including all\nTexas state-court judges and clerks as defendants. In the end, the\npetitioners say, they intend to seek an order enjoining all\nstate-court clerks from docketing S.\u00a0B.\u00a08 cases and all\nstate-court judges from hearing them.Almost immediately, however, the petitioners\u2019\ntheory confronts a difficulty. Generally, States are immune from\nsuit under the terms of the Eleventh Amendment and the doctrine of\nsovereign immunity. See,e.g.,Aldenv.Maine,527 U.S.\n706, 713 (1999). To be sure, inEx\u00a0parte Young,\nthis Court recognized a narrow exception grounded in traditional\nequity practice\u2014one that allows certain private parties to seek\njudicial orders in federal court preventing state executive\nofficials from enforcing state laws that are contrary to federal\nlaw.209 U.S.\n123, 159\u2013160 (1908). But asEx\u00a0parte Youngexplained, this traditional exception does not normally permit\nfederal courts to issue injunctions against state-court judges or\nclerks. Usually, those individuals do not enforce state laws as\nexecutive officials might; instead, they work to resolve disputes\nbetween parties. If a state court errs in its rulings, too, the\ntraditional remedy has been some form of appeal, including to this\nCourt, not the entry of anex anteinjunction preventing the\nstate court from hearing cases. AsEx\u00a0parte Youngput\nit, \u201can injunction against a state court\u201d or its \u201cmachinery\u201d \u201cwould\nbe a violation of the whole scheme of our Government.\u201dId.,\nat 163.Nor is that the only problem confronting the\npetitioners\u2019 court-and-clerk theory. Article III of the\nConstitution affords federal courts the power to resolve only\n\u201cactual controversies arising between adverse litigants.\u201dMuskratv.United States,219\nU.S. 346, 361 (1911). Private parties who seek to bring\nS.\u00a0B.\u00a08 suits in state court may be litigants adverse to\nthe petitioners. But the state-court clerks who docket those\ndisputes and the state-court judges who decide them generally are\nnot. Clerks serve to file cases as they arrive, not to participate\nas adversaries in those disputes. Judges exist to resolve\ncontroversies about a law\u2019s meaning or its conformance to the\nFederal and State Constitutions, not to wage battle as contestants\nin the parties\u2019 litigation. As this Court has explained, \u201cno case\nor controversy\u201d exists \u201cbetween a judge who adjudicates claims\nunder a statute and a litigant who attacks the constitutionality of\nthe statute.\u201dPulliamv.Allen,466 U.S.\n522, 538, n.\u00a018 (1984).Then there is the question of remedy. Texas Rule\nof Civil Procedure 24 directs state-court clerks to accept\ncomplaints and record case numbers. The petitioners have pointed to\nnothing in Texas law that permits clerks to pass on the substance\nof the filings they docket\u2014let alone refuse a party\u2019s complaint\nbased on an assessment of its merits. Nor does Article III confer\non federal judges some \u201camorphous\u201d power to supervise \u201cthe\noperations of government\u201d and reimagine from the ground up the job\ndescription of Texas state-court clerks.Rainesv.Byrd,521 U.S.\n811, 829 (1997) (internal quotation marks omitted).Troubling, too, the petitioners have not offered\nany meaningful limiting principles for their theory. If it caught\non and federal judges could enjoin state courts and clerks from\nentertaining disputes between private parties underthisstate law, what would stop federal judges from prohibiting state\ncourts and clerks from hearing and docketing disputes between\nprivate parties underotherstate laws? And if the state\ncourts and clerks somehow qualify as \u201cadverse litigants\u201d for\nArticle III purposes in the present case, when would they not? The\npetitioners offer no satisfactory answers.Instead, only further questions follow. Under\nthe petitioners\u2019 theory, would clerks have to assemble a blacklist\nof banned claims subject to immediate dismissal? What kind of\ninquiry would a state court have to apply to satisfy due process\nbefore dismissing those suits? How notorious would the alleged\nconstitutional defects of a claim have to be before a state-court\nclerk would risk legal jeopardy merely for filing it? Would States\nhave to hire independent legal counsel for their clerks\u2014and would\nthose advisers be the next target of suits seeking injunctive\nrelief\u00a0? When a party hales a state-court clerk into federal\ncourt for filing a complaint containing a purportedly\nunconstitutional claim, how would the clerk defend himself\nconsistent with his ethical obligation of neutrality? See Tex. Code\nof Judicial Conduct Canon 3(B)(10) (2021) (instructing judges and\ncourt staff to abstain from taking public positions on pending or\nimpending proceedings). Could federal courts enjoin those who\nperform other ministerial tasks potentially related to litigation,\nlike the postal carrier who delivers complaints to the courthouse?\nMany more questions than answers would present themselves if the\nCourt journeyed this way.Our colleagues writing separately today supply\nno answers either. They agree that state-court judges are not\nproper defendants in this lawsuit because they are \u201cin no sense\nadverse\u201d to the parties whose cases they decide.Post, at 4\n(opinion of Roberts, C.\u00a0J.). At the same time, our colleagues\nsay they would allow this case to proceed against clerks like Ms.\nClarkston. Seeibid.; see alsopost, at 7 (opinion of\nSotomayor, J.). But in doing so they fail to address the many\nremedial questions their path invites. They neglect to explain how\nclerks who merely docket S.\u00a0B.\u00a08 lawsuits can be\nconsidered \u201cadverse litigants\u201d for Article III purposes while the\njudges they serve cannot. And they fail to reconcile their views\nwithEx\u00a0parte Young. The Chief Justice acknowledges,\nfor example, that clerks set in motion the\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018machinery\u2019\u00a0\u201d of court proceedings.Post, at 4.\nYet he disregardsEx\u00a0parte Young\u2019s express teaching\nagainst enjoining the \u201cmachinery\u201d of courts. 209 U.\u00a0S., at\n163.Justice Sotomayor seems to admit at least part\nof the problem. She concedes that older \u201cwooden\u201d authorities likeEx\u00a0parteYoungappear to prohibit suits against\nstate-court clerks.Post, at 7. Still, she insists, we\nshould disregard those cases in favor of more \u201cmodern\u201d case law.Ibid.In places, The Chief Justice\u2019s opinion seems to pursue\nmuch the same line of argument. Seepost, at 4. But even\noverlooking all the other problems attending our colleagues\u2019\n\u201cclerks-only\u201d theory, the authorities they cite do not begin to do\nthe work attributed to them.Most prominently, our colleagues point toPulliam. But that case had nothing to do with state-court\nclerks, injunctions against them, or the doctrine of sovereign\nimmunity. Instead, the Court faced only the question whether the\nsuit before it could proceed against a judge consistent with the\ndistinct doctrine of judicial immunity. 466 U.\u00a0S., at 541\u2013543.\nAs well, the plaintiff sought an injunction only to prevent the\njudge from enforcing a rule of her own creation.Id., at\n526. No one asked the Court to prevent the judge from processing\nthe case consistent with state statutory law, let alone undoEx\u00a0parte Young\u2019s teaching that federal courts lack such\npower under traditional equitable principles. Tellingly, our\ncolleagues do not readPulliamto authorize claims against\nstate-court judges in this case. And given that, it is a mystery\nhow they might invoke the case as authority for claims against\n(only) state-court clerks, officialsPulliamnever\ndiscussed.If anything, the remainder of our colleagues\u2019\ncases are even further afield.Mitchumv.Fosterdid\nnot involve state-court clerks, but a judge, prosecutor, and\nsheriff. See315 F. Supp. 1387, 1388 (ND Fla. 1970)\n(per\u00a0curiam). When it came to these individuals, the\nCourt held only that the Anti-Injunction Act did not bar suit\nagainst them.407 U.S.\n225, 242\u2013243 (1972). Once more, the Court did not purport to\npass judgment on any sovereign immunity defense, let alone suggest\nany disagreement withEx\u00a0parte Young. To the contrary,\nthe Court went out of its way to emphasize that its decision should\nnot be taken as passing on the question whether \u201cprinciples of\nequity, comity, and federalism\u201d might bar the suit. 407 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 243. Meanwhile,Shelleyv.Kraemerdid not even\ninvolve a pre-enforcement challenge against any state-official\ndefendant.334 U.S. 1(1948). There, the petitioners simply sought to raise the\nConstitution as adefenseagainst other private parties\nseeking to enforce a restrictive covenant,id., at 14, much\nas the petitioners here would be able to raise the Constitution as\na defense in any S.\u00a0B.\u00a08 enforcement action brought by\nothers against them. Simply put, nothing in any of our colleagues\u2019\ncases supports their novel suggestion that we should allow a\npre-enforcement action for injunctive relief against state-court\nclerks, all while simultaneously holding the judges they serve\nimmune.BPerhaps recognizing the problems with their\ncourt-and-clerk theory, the petitioners briefly advance an\nalternative. They say they seek to enjoin the Texas attorney\ngeneral from enforcing S.\u00a0B.\u00a08. Such an injunction, the\npetitioners submit, would also automatically bind any private party\nwho might try to bring an S.\u00a0B.\u00a08 suit against them.\nReply Brief for Petitioners 21. But the petitioners barely develop\nthis back-up theory in their briefing, and it too suffers from some\nobvious problems.Start with perhaps the most straightforward.\nWhileEx\u00a0parte Youngauthorizes federal courts to\nenjoin certain state officials from enforcing state laws, the\npetitioners do not direct this Court to any enforcement authority\nthe attorney general possesses in connection with S.\u00a0B.\u00a08\nthat a federal court might enjoin him from exercising. Maybe the\nclosest the petitioners come is when they point to a state statute\nthat says the attorney general \u201cmay institute an action for a civil\npenalty of $1,000\u201d for violations of \u201cthis subtitle or a rule or\norder adopted by the [Texas Medical B]oard.\u201d Tex. Occ. Code Ann.\n\u00a7165.101 (West 2012). But the qualification \u201cthis subtitle\u201d limits\nthe attorney general\u2019s enforcement authority to the Texas\nOccupational Code, specifically \u00a7\u00a7151.001 through 171.024. By\ncontrast, S.\u00a0B.\u00a08 is codified in the Texas Health and\nSafety Code at \u00a7\u00a7171.201\u2013171.212. The Act thus does not fall within\n\u201cthis subtitle.\u201d Nor have the petitioners identified for us any\n\u201crule or order adopted by the\u201d Texas Medical Board related to\nS.\u00a0B.\u00a08 that the attorney general might enforce against\nthem. To be sure, some of our colleagues suggest that the Board\nmight in the future promulgate such a rule and the attorney general\nmight then undertake an enforcement action.Post, at 3\n(opinion of Roberts, C.\u00a0J.) (citing 22 Tex. Admin. Code\n\u00a7190.8(7) (West 2021)). But this is a series of hypotheticals and\nan argument even the petitioners do not attempt to advance for\nthemselves.Even if we could overcome this problem, doing so\nwould only expose another. Supposing the attorney general did have\nsome enforcement authority under S.\u00a0B.\u00a08, the petitioners\nhave identified nothing that might allow a federal court to parlay\nthat authority, or any defendant\u2019s enforcement authority, into an\ninjunction against any and all unnamed private persons who might\nseek to bring their own S.\u00a0B.\u00a08 suits. The equitable\npowers of federal courts are limited by historical practice.Atlas Life Ins. Co.v.W. I. Southern,Inc.,306 U.S.\n563, 568 (1939). \u201cA court of equity is as much so limited as a\ncourt of law.\u201dAlemite Mfg. Corp.v.Staff, 42 F.2d\n832 (CA2 1930) (L. Hand, J.). Consistent with historical practice,\na federal court exercising its equitable authority may enjoin named\ndefendants from taking specified unlawful actions. But under\ntraditional equitable principles, no court may \u201clawfully enjoin the\nworld at large,\u201dibid., or purport to enjoin challenged\n\u201claws themselves,\u201dWhole Woman\u2019s Health, 594 U.\u00a0S., at\n___ (slip op., at 1) (citingCaliforniav.Texas, 593\nU.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2021) (slip op., at 8)).Our colleagues offer no persuasive reply to this\nproblem. The Chief Justice does not address it. Meanwhile, Justice\nSotomayor offers a radical answer, suggesting once more that this\nCourt should cast aside its precedents requiring federal courts to\nabide by traditional equitable principles.Post, at 9,\nn.\u00a03. This time, however, Justice Sotomayor does not claim to\nidentify any countervailing authority to support her proposal.\nInstead, she says, it is justified purely by the fact that the\nState of Texas in S.\u00a0B.\u00a08 has \u201cdelegat[ed] its\nenforcement authority to the world at large.\u201dIbid.But\nsomewhat analogous complaints could be levied against private\nattorneys general acts, statutes allowing for private rights of\naction, tort law, federal antitrust law, and even the Civil Rights\nAct of 1964. In some sense all of these laws \u201cdelegate\u201d the\nenforcement of public policy to private parties and reward those\nwho bring suits with \u201cbount[ies]\u201d like exemplary or statutory\ndamages and attorney\u2019s fees. Nor does Justice Sotomayor explain\nwhere her novel plan to overthrow this Court\u2019s precedents and\nexpand the equitable powers of federal courts would stop\u2014or on what\ntheory it might plausibly happen to reach just this case or maybe\nthose exactly like it.[2]CWhile this Court\u2019s precedents foreclose some\nof the petitioners\u2019 claims for relief, others survive. The\npetitioners also name as defendants Stephen Carlton, Katherine\nThomas, Allison Benz, and Cecile Young. On the briefing and\nargument before us, it appears that these particular defendants\nfall within the scope ofEx\u00a0parte Young\u2019s historic\nexception to state sovereign immunity. Each of these individuals is\nan executive licensing official who may or must take enforcement\nactions against the petitioners if they violate the terms of\nTexas\u2019s Health and Safety Code, including S.\u00a0B.\u00a08. See,e.g., Tex. Occ. Code Ann. \u00a7164.055(a); Brief for Petitioners\n33\u201334. Accordingly, we hold that sovereign immunity does not bar\nthe petitioners\u2019 suit against these named defendants at the motion\nto dismiss stage.[3]Justice Thomas alone reaches a different\nconclusion. He emphasizes that suits seeking equitable relief\nagainst executive officials are permissible only when supported by\ntradition. Seepost, at 2\u20133 (opinion concurring in part and\ndissenting in part). He further emphasizes that the relevant\ntradition here, embodied inEx\u00a0parte Young, permits\nequitable relief against only those officials who possess authority\nto enforce a challenged state law.Post, at 3\u20134. We agree\nwith all of these principles; our disagreement is restricted to\ntheir application.Justice Thomas suggests that the\nlicensing-official defendants lack authority to enforce\nS.\u00a0B.\u00a08 because that statute says it is to be\n\u201cexclusively\u201d enforced through private civil actions\n\u201c[n]otwithstanding .\u00a0.\u00a0. any other law.\u201d See Tex. Health\n& Safety Code Ann. \u00a7171.207(a). But the same provision of\nS.\u00a0B.\u00a08alsostates that the law \u201cmay not be\nconstrued to .\u00a0.\u00a0. limit the enforceability of any other\nlaws that regulate or prohibit abortion.\u201d \u00a7171.207(b)(3). This\nsaving clause is significant because, as best we can tell from the\nbriefing before us, the licensing-official defendantsarecharged with enforcing \u201cother laws that regulate .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nabortion.\u201d Consider, for example, Texas Occupational Code \u00a7164.055,\ntitled \u201cProhibited Acts Regarding Abortion.\u201d That provision states\nthat the Texas Medical Board \u201cshall take an appropriate\ndisciplinary action against a physician who violates\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. Chapter 171, Health and Safety Code,\u201d a part of\nTexas statutory law thatincludesS.\u00a0B.\u00a08.\nAccordingly, it appears Texas law imposes on the licensing-official\ndefendants a duty to enforce a law that \u201cregulate[s] or prohibit[s]\nabortion,\u201d a duty expressly preserved by S.\u00a0B.\u00a08\u2019s saving\nclause. Of course, Texas courts and not this one are the final\narbiters of the meaning of state statutory directions. SeeRailroad Comm\u2019n of Tex.v.Pullman Co.,312 U.S.\n496, 500 (1941). But at least based on the limited arguments\nput to us at this stage of the litigation, it appears that the\nlicensing defendants do have authority to enforce\nS.\u00a0B.\u00a08.[4]In the face of this conclusion, Justice Thomas\nadvances an alternative argument. He stresses that to maintain a\nsuit consistent with this Court\u2019sEx\u00a0parte Youngand\nArticle III precedents, \u201cit is not enough that petitioners \u2018feel\ninhibited\u2019\u00a0\u201d or \u201c\u00a0\u2018chill[ed]\u2019\u00a0\u201d by the abstract\npossibility of an enforcement action against them.Post, at\n6\u20137. Rather, they must show at least a credible threat of such an\naction against them.Post, at 7. Again, we agree with these\nobservations in principle and disagree only on their application to\nthe facts of this case. The petitioners have plausibly alleged that\nS.\u00a0B.\u00a08 has already had a direct effect on their\nday-to-day operations. See Complaint \u00b6\u00b6103, 106\u2013109. And they have\nidentified provisions of state law that appear to impose a duty on\nthe licensing-official defendants to bring disciplinary actions\nagainst them if they violate S.\u00a0B.\u00a08. In our judgment,\nthis is enough at the motion to dismiss stage to suggest the\npetitioners will be the target of an enforcement action and thus\nallow this suit to proceed.DWhile this interlocutory appeal focuses\nprimarily on the Texas official defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss on\ngrounds of sovereign immunity and justiciability, before we granted\ncertiorari the Fifth Circuit also agreed to take up an appeal by\nthe sole private defendant, Mr. Dickson. In the briefing before us,\nno one contests this decision. In his appeal, Mr. Dickson argues\nthat the petitioners lack standing to sue him because he possesses\nno intention to file an S.\u00a0B.\u00a08 suit against them. Mr.\nDickson has supplied sworn declarations so attesting. See,e.g., Brief for Respondent Dickson 32. The petitioners do\nnot contest this testimony or ask us to disregard it. Accordingly,\non the record before us the petitioners cannot establish \u201cpersonal\ninjury fairly traceable to [Mr. Dickson\u2019s] allegedly unlawful\nconduct.\u201dCaliforniav.Texas, 593 U.\u00a0S., at ___\n(slip op., at 9) (internal quotation marks omitted). No Member of\nthe Court disagrees with this resolution of the claims against Mr.\nDickson.IIIWhile this should be enough to resolve the\npetitioners\u2019 appeal, a detour is required before we close. Justice\nSotomayor charges this Court with \u201cshrink[ing]\u201d from the task of\ndefending the supremacy of the Federal Constitution over state law.Post, at 10. That rhetoric bears no relation to reality.The truth is, many paths exist to vindicate the\nsupremacy of federal law in this area. Even aside from the fact\nthat eight Members of the Court agree sovereign immunity does not\nbar the petitioners from bringing this pre-enforcement challenge in\nfederal court, everyone acknowledges that other pre-enforcement\nchallenges may be possible in state court as well.[5] In fact, 14 such state-court cases already\nseek to vindicate both federal and state constitutional claims\nagainst S.\u00a0B.\u00a08\u2014and they have met with some success at\nthe summary judgment stage. Seesupra,at 2. Separately, any\nindividual sued under S.\u00a0B.\u00a08 may pursue state and\nfederal constitutional arguments in his or her defense. See\nn.\u00a01,supra. Still further viable avenues to contest\nthe law\u2019s compliance with the Federal Constitution also may be\npossible; we do not prejudge the possibility. Given all this,\nJustice Sotomayor\u2019s suggestion that the Court\u2019s ruling somehow\n\u201cclears the way\u201d for the \u201cnullification\u201d of federal law along the\nlines of what happened in the Jim Crow South not only wildly\nmischaracterizes the impact of today\u2019s decision, it cheapens the\ngravity of past wrongs.Post, at 11.The truth is, too, that unlike the petitioners\nbefore us, those seeking to challenge the constitutionality of\nstate laws are not always able to pick and choose the timing and\npreferred forum for their arguments. This Court has never\nrecognized an unqualified right to pre-enforcement review of\nconstitutional claims in federal court. In fact, general federal\nquestion jurisdiction did not even exist for much of this Nation\u2019s\nhistory. SeeMimsv.Arrow Financial Services,LLC,565 U.S.\n368, 376 (2012). And pre-enforcement review under the statutory\nregime the petitioners invoke, 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71983, was not\nprominent until the mid- 20th century. SeeMonroev.\nPape,365 U.S.\n167, 180 (1961); see also R. Fallon, J. Manning, D. Meltzer,\n& D. Shapiro, Hart and Wechsler\u2019s The Federal Courts and the\nFederal System 994 (7th ed. 2015). To this day, many federal\nconstitutional rights are as a practical matter asserted typically\nas defenses to state-law claims, not in federal pre-enforcement\ncases like this one. See,e.g.,Snyderv.Phelps,562 U.S.\n443(2011) ( First Amendment used as a defense to a state tort\nsuit).Finally, Justice Sotomayor contends that\nS.\u00a0B.\u00a08 \u201cchills\u201d the exercise of federal constitutional\nrights. If nothing else, she says, this fact warrants allowing\nfurther relief in this case.Post, at 1\u20132, 7\u20138. Here again,\nhowever, it turns out that the Court has already and often\nconfronted\u2014and rejected\u2014this very line of thinking. As our cases\nexplain, the \u201cchilling effect\u201d associated with a potentially\nunconstitutional law being \u201c\u00a0\u2018on the books\u2019\u00a0\u201d is\ninsufficient to \u201cjustify federal intervention\u201d in a pre-enforcement\nsuit.Youngerv.Harris,401 U.S.\n37, 42, 50\u201351 (1971). Instead, this Court has always required\nproof of a more concrete injury and compliance with traditional\nrules of equitable practice. SeeMuskrat, 219 U.\u00a0S., at\n361;Ex\u00a0parte Young, 209 U.\u00a0S., at 159\u2013160. The\nCourt has consistently applied these requirements whether the\nchallenged law in question is said to chill the free exercise of\nreligion, the freedom of speech, the right to bear arms, or any\nother right. The petitioners are not entitled to a special\nexemption.Maybe so, Justice Sotomayor replies, but what if\nother States pass legislation similar to S.\u00a0B.\u00a08? Doesn\u2019t\nthat possibility justify throwing aside our traditional rules?Post, at 10. It does not. If other States pass similar\nlegislation, pre-enforcement challenges like the one the Court\napproves today may be available in federal court to test the\nconstitutionality of those laws. Again, too, further\npre-enforcement challenges may be permissible in state court and\nfederal law may be asserted as a defense in any enforcement action.\nTo the extent Justice Sotomayor seems to wish evenmoretools existed to combat this type of law, Congress is free to\nprovide them. In fact, the House of Representatives recently passed\na statute that would purport to preempt state laws like\nS.\u00a0B.\u00a08. See H.\u00a0R. 3755, 117th Cong., 1st Sess.\n(2021). But one thing this Court may never do is disregard the\ntraditional limits on the jurisdiction of federal courts just to\nsee a favored result win the day. At the end of that road is a\nworld in which \u201c[t]he division of power\u201d among the branches of\nGovernment \u201ccould exist no longer, and the other departments would\nbe swallowed up by the judiciary.\u201d 4 Papers of John Marshall 95 (C.\nCullen ed. 1984).[6]IVThe petitioners\u2019 theories for relief face\nserious challenges but also present some opportunities. To\nsummarize: (1) The Court unanimously rejects the petitioners\u2019\ntheory for relief against state-court judges and agrees Judge\nJackson should be dismissed from this suit. (2) A majority reaches\nthe same conclusion with respect to the petitioners\u2019 parallel\ntheory for relief against state-court clerks. (3) With respect to\nthe back-up theory of relief the petitioners present against\nAttorney General Paxton, a majority concludes that he must be\ndismissed. (4) At the same time, eight Justices hold this case may\nproceed past the motion to dismiss stage against Mr. Carlton, Ms.\nThomas, Ms. Benz, and Ms. Young, defendants with specific\ndisciplinary authority over medical licensees, including the\npetitioners. (5) Every Member of the Court accepts that the only\nnamed private-individual defendant, Mr. Dickson, should be\ndismissed.The order of the District Court is affirmed in\npart and reversed in part, and the case is remanded for further\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.So ordered.Notes1Justice Sotomayor\nsuggests that the defense described in S.\u00a0B.\u00a08 supplies\nonly a \u201cshell of what the Constitution requires\u201d and effectively\n\u201cnullif[ies]\u201d its guarantees.Post, at 2\u20134 (opinion\nconcurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part); see alsopost, at 1, n.\u00a01 (Roberts, C.\u00a0J., concurring in\njudgment in part and dissenting in part). But whatever a state\nstatute may or may not say, applicable federal constitutional\ndefenses always stand fully available when properly asserted. See\nU.\u00a0S. Const., Art. VI.2This is not to say that\nthe petitioners, or other abortion providers, lack potentially\ntriable state-law claims that S.\u00a0B.\u00a08 improperly\ndelegates state law enforcement authority. Nor do we determine\nwhether any particular S.\u00a0B.\u00a08 plaintiff possesses\nstanding to sue under state justiciability doctrines. We note only\nthat such arguments do not justify federal courts abandoning\ntraditional limits on their equitable authority and our precedents\nenforcing them.3The petitioners may\nproceed against Ms. Young solely based on her authority to\nsupervise licensing of abortion facilities and ambulatory surgical\ncenters, and not with respect to any other enforcement authority\nunder Chapter 171 of the Texas Health and Safety Code.4Tending to confirm our\nunderstanding of the statute is the fact that S.\u00a0B.\u00a08\nexpressly prohibits \u201cenforcement of Chapters 19 and 22, Penal Code,\nin response to violations of this subchapter.\u201d Tex. Health &\nSafety Code Ann. \u00a7171.207(a). This language suggests that the Texas\nLegislature knew how to prohibit collateral enforcement mechanisms\nwhen it adopted S.\u00a0B.\u00a08, and understood that it was\nnecessary to do so. To read S.\u00a0B.\u00a08 as barring any\ncollateral enforcement mechanisms without a specific exclusion\nwould thus threaten to render this statutory language superfluous.\nSeeKallinenv.Houston, 462 S.W.3d 25, 28 (Tex.\n2015) (courts should avoid treating any statutory language as\nsurplusage);Kungysv.United States,485 U.S.\n759, 778 (1988) (same).5Justice Sotomayor\u2019s\ncomplaint thus isn\u2019t really aboutwhetherthis case should\nproceed. It is only aboutwhichparticular defendants the\npetitioners may sue in this particular lawsuit. And even when it\ncomes to that question, Justice Sotomayor agrees with the Court\nregarding the proper disposition of several classes of\ndefendants\u2014state-court judges, licensing officials, and Mr.\nDickson.6Justice Sotomayor\ncharges this Court with \u201cdelay\u201d in resolving this case. Seepost, at 11. In fact, this case has received extraordinary\nsolicitude at every turn. This Court resolved the petitioners\u2019\nfirst emergency application in approximately two days. The Court\nthen agreed to decide in the first instance the merits of an appeal\npending in the Court of Appeals. The Court ordered briefing, heard\nargument, and issued an opinion on the merits\u2014accompanied by three\nseparate writings\u2014all in fewer than 50 days.",
