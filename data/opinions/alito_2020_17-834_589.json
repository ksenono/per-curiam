Respondents\u2014three\naliens who are not authorized to work in this country\u2014were\nconvicted under these provisions for fraudulently using another\nperson\u2019s Social Security number on state and federal\ntax-withholding forms that they submitted when they obtained\nemployment. The Supreme Court of Kansas held that a provision of\nthe Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA), 100Stat.\n3359, expressly preempts the Kansas statutes at issue insofar as\nthey provide a basis for these prosecutions. We reject this reading\nof the provision in question, as well as respondents\u2019 alternative\narguments based on implied preemption. We therefore reverse.IAThe foundation of our laws on immigration and\nnaturalization is the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA),\n66Stat. 163, as amended, 8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71101et\u00a0seq., which sets out the \u201c\u00a0\u2018terms and\nconditions of admission to the country and the subsequent treatment\nof aliens lawfully in the country.\u2019\u00a0\u201dChamberof\nCommerce of United States of Americav.Whiting,563 U.S.\n582, 587 (2011). As initially enacted, the INA did not prohibit\nthe employment of illegal aliens, and this Court held that federal\nlaw left room for the States to regulate in this field. SeeDe\nCanasv.Bica,424 U.S.\n351, 353 (1976).With the enactment of IRCA, Congress took a\ndifferent approach. IRCA made it unlawful to hire an alien knowing\nthat he or she is unauthorized to work in the United States.\n8\u00a0U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a71324a(a)(1)(A), (h)(3). To enforce this\nprohibition, IRCA requires employers to comply with a federal\nemployment verification system. \u00a71324a(b). Using a federal\nwork-authorization form (I\u20139), employers \u201cmust attest\u201d that they\nhave \u201cverified\u201d that an employee \u201cis not an unauthorized alien\u201d by\nexamining approved documents such as a United States passport or\nalien registration card. \u00a71324a(b)(1)(A); see also\n\u00a7\u00a71324a(b)(1)(B)\u2013(D); 8 CFR \u00a7274a.2(a)(2) (2019) (establishing Form\nI\u20139). This requirement applies to the hiring of any individual\nregardless of citizenship or nationality. 8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a71324a(b)(1). Employers who fail to comply may face civil and\ncriminal sanctions. See \u00a7\u00a71324a(e)(4), (f\u00a0); 8 CFR \u00a7274 A. 10.\nIRCA instructs employers to retain copies of their I\u20139 forms and\nallows employers to make copies of the documents submitted by\nemployees to show their authorization to work. 8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7\u00a71324a(b)(3)\u2013(4).IRCA concomitantly imposes duties on all\nemployees, regardless of citizenship. No later than their first day\nof employment, all employees must complete an I\u20139 and attest that\nthey fall into a category of persons who are authorized to work in\nthe United States. \u00a71324a(b)(2); 8 CFR \u00a7274a.2(b)(1)(i)(A). In\naddition, under penalty of perjury, every employee must provide\ncertain personal information\u2014specifically: name, residence address,\nbirth date, Social Security number, e-mail address, and telephone\nnumber. It is a federal crime for an employee to provide false\ninformation on an I\u20139 or to use fraudulent documents to show\nauthorization to work. See 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a71028, 1546.\nFederal law does not make it a crime for an alien to work without\nauthorization, and this Court has held that state laws\ncriminalizing such conduct are preempted.Arizonav.United States,567 U.S.\n387, 403\u2013407 (2012). But if an alien works illegally, the\nalien\u2019s immigration status may be adversely affected. See 8\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a71255(c)(2), (8), 1227(a)(1)(C)(i).While IRCA imposes these requirements on\nemployers and employees, it also limits the use of I\u20139 forms. A\nprovision entitled \u201cLimitation on use of attestation form,\u201d\n\u00a71324a(b)(5), provides that I\u20139 forms and \u201cany information\ncontained in or appended to such form[s] may not be used for\npurposes other than for enforcement of\u00a0\u201d the INA or other\nspecified provisions of federal law, including those prohibiting\nthe making of a false statement in a federal mat- ter ( 18\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71001), identity theft (\u00a71028),\nimmigration-document fraud (\u00a71546), and perjury (\u00a71621). In\naddition, 8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71324a(d)(2)(F) prohibits use of\n\u201cthe employ- ment verification system\u201d \u201cfor law enforcement\npurposes,\u201d apart from the enforcement of the aforementioned federal\nstatutes.Although IRCA expressly regulates the use of\nI\u20139\u2019s and documents appended to that form, no provision of IRCA\ndirectly addresses the use of other documents, such as federal and\nstate tax-withholding forms, that an employee may complete upon\nbeginning a new job. A federal regulation provides that all\nemployees must furnish their employers with a signed withholding\nexemption certificate when they start a new job, but federal law\napparently does not require the discharge of an employee who fails\nto do so. See 26 CFR \u00a7\u00a731.3402(f\u00a0)(2)\u20131, (5)\u20131 (2019).\nInstead, the regulation provides that if an employee fails to\nprovide a signed W\u20134, the employer must treat the employee \u201cas a\nsingle person claiming no exemptions.\u201d \u00a731.3402(f\u00a0)(2)\u20131(a).\nThe submission of a fraudulent W\u20134, however, is a federal crime. 26\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a77205.Kansas uses a tax-withholding form (K\u20134) that is\nsimilar to the federal form. Kan. Stat. Ann. \u00a779\u20133298 (2018 Cum.\nSupp.); Kansas Dept. of Revenue, Notice 07\u201307: New K\u20134 Form for\nState Withholding (Sept. 5, 2007), www.ortho\ndon.com/home/document/KS-WithholdingForm.pdf; Kansas Dept. of\nRevenue, Kansas Withholding Form K\u20134, www.ks\nrevenue.org/k4info.html. Employees must attest to the veracity of\nthe information under penalty of perjury. Form K\u20134, Kansas\nEmployee\u2019s Withholding Allowance Certificate (rev.

Ann. \u00a721\u20135903; see also\nKansas Dept. of Revenue, Tax Fraud Enforcement,\nwww.ksrevenue.org/taxfraud.html.Finally, IRCA contains a provision that\nexpressly \u201cpreempt[s] any State or local law imposing civil or\ncriminal sanctions (other than through licensing and similar laws)upon those who employ,or recruit or refer for a fee for\nemployment,unauthorized aliens.\u201d 8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a71324a(h)(2) (emphasis added). This provision makes no mention of\nstate or local laws that impose criminal or civil sanctions on\nemployees or applicants for employment. Seeibid.BLike other States, Kansas has laws against\nfraud, forgeries, and identity theft. These statutes apply to\ncitizens and aliens alike and are not limited to conduct that\noccurs in connection with employment. The Kansas identity-theft\nstatute criminalizes the \u201cusing\u201d of any \u201cpersonal identifying\ninformation\u201d belonging to another person with the intent to\n\u201c[d]efraud that person, or anyone else, in order to receive any\nbenefit.\u201d Kan. Stat. Ann. \u00a721\u20136107(a)(1). \u201c[P]ersonal identifying\ninformation\u201d includes, among other things, a person\u2019s name, birth\ndate, driver\u2019s license number, and Social Security number.\n\u00a721\u20136107(e)(2). Kansas courts have interpreted the statute to cover\nthe use of another person\u2019s Social Security number to receive the\nbenefits of employment. SeeStatev.Meza, 38 Kan.\nApp. 2d 245, 247\u2013250, 165 P.3d 298, 301\u2013302 (2007).Kansas\u2019s false-information statute criminalizes,\namong other things, \u201cmaking, generating, distributing or drawing\u201d a\n\u201cwritten instrument\u201d with knowledge that it \u201cfalsely states or\nrepresents some material matter\u201d and \u201cwith intent to defraud,\nobstruct the detection of a theft or felony offense or induce\nofficial action.\u201d \u00a721\u20135824.The respondents in the three cases now before us\nare aliens who are not authorized to work in this country but\nnevertheless secured employment by using the identity of other\npersons on the I\u20139 forms that they completed when they applied for\nwork. They also used these same false identities when they\ncompleted their W\u20134\u2019s and K\u20134\u2019s. All three respondents were\nconvicted under one or both of the Kansas laws just mentioned for\nfraudulently using another person\u2019s Social Security number on\ntax-withholding forms. We summarize the pertinent facts related to\nthese three prosecutions.CRamiro Garcia. In August 2012, a local\npatrol officer stopped Garcia for speeding and learned that Garcia\nhad been previously contacted by a financial crimes detective about\npossible identity theft. App. 39\u201344, 89\u201391; 306 Kan. 1113, 1114,\n401 P.3d 588, 590 (2017). Local authorities obtained the documents\nthat Garcia had completed when he began work at a restaurant, and a\njoint state-federal investigation discovered that Garcia had used\nanother person\u2019s Social Security number on his I\u20139, W\u20134, and K\u20134\nforms. The State then charged Garcia with identity theft. The\ncomplaint alleged that, when he began work at the restaurant, he\nused another person\u2019s Social Security number with the intent to\ndefraud and in order to receive a benefit. App. 9\u201310.Donaldo Morales.A joint state-federal\ninvestigation of Morales began after the Kansas Department of Labor\nnotified a Social Security agent that an employee at a local\nrestaurant was using a Social Security number that did not match\nthe identifying information in the department\u2019s files. 306 Kan.\n1100, 1101, 401 P.3d 155, 156 (2017); App. to Pet. for Cert. 73;\nApp. 124\u2013125, 168\u2013170. A federal agent contacted the restaurant and\nlearned that Morales had used another person\u2019s Social Security\nnumber on his I\u20139, W\u20134, and K\u20134 forms. The federal agent arrested\nMorales, who then admitted that he had bought the Social Security\nnumber from someone he met in a park. App. 171\u2013172; 306 Kan., at\n1101\u20131102, 401 P.\u00a03d, at 156; App. to Pet. for Cert.73. This\ninformation was turned over to state prosecutors, who charged\nMorales with identity theft and making false information. App.\n124\u2013125; 306 Kan., at 1101, 401 P.\u00a03d, at 156.Guadalupe Ochoa-Lara. Ochoa-Lara came to\nthe attention of a joint state-federal task force after officers\nlearned that he had used a Social Security number issued to someone\nelse when he leased an apartment. 306 Kan. 1107, 1108\u20131109, 401\nP.3d 159, 160\u2013161 (2017). The individual to whom this number was\nlawfully assigned advised the investigating officers that she had\nno knowledge that another person was using her number, and she\nlater told authorities that income that she had not earned had been\nreported under her number.Id.,at 1109, 401 P.\u00a03d, at\n160. After contacting the restaurant where Ochoa-Lara worked,\ninvestigators determined that he had also used the same Social\nSecurity number to complete his I\u20139 and W\u20134 forms.Ibid. The\nState charged Ochoa-Lara with identity theft and making false\ninformation for using another\u2019s Social Security number on those\ndocuments.DIn all three cases, respondents argued before\ntrial that IRCA preempted their prosecutions. They relied on 8\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71324a(b)(5), which, as noted, provides that I\u20139\nforms and \u201cany information contained in or appended to such form[s]\nmay not be used for purposes other than for enforcement of\u00a0\u201d\nthe INA or other listed federal statutes. In response, the State\ndismissed the charges that were based on I\u20139\u2019s and agreed not to\nrely on the I\u20139\u2019s at trial. The State maintained, however, that\n\u00a71324a(b)(5) did not apply to the respondents\u2019 use of false Social\nSecurity numbers on the tax-withholding forms.The trial courts allowed the State to proceed\nwith the charges based on those forms. The State entered the K\u20134\u2019s\nand W\u20134\u2019s into evidence against Garcia and Morales, and Ochoa-Lara\nstipulated to using a stolen Social Security number on a W\u20134. App.\n109\u2013110; 306 Kan., at 1108\u20131109, 401 P.\u00a03d, at\n160\u2013161.[1] Respondents were\nconvicted, and three separate panels of the Kansas Court of Appeals\naffirmed their convictions.A divided Kansas Supreme Court reversed,\nconcluding that \u201cthe plain and unambiguous language of 8\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71324a(b)(5)\u201d expressly prohibits a State from\nusing \u201cany information contained within [an] I\u20139 as the bas[i]s for\na state law identity theft prosecution of an alien who uses\nanother\u2019s Social Security information in an I\u20139.\u201d 306 Kan., at\n1130\u20131131, 401 P.3d at 599 (emphasis deleted). The court added that\n\u201c[t]he fact that this information was included in the W\u20134 and K\u20134\ndid not alter the fact that it was also part of the I\u20139.\u201dId., at 1131, 401 P.\u00a03d, at 599. In deciding the appeal\non these grounds, the court appears to have embraced the\nproposition that any fact to which an employee attests in an I\u20139 is\ninformation that is \u201ccontained in\u201d the I\u20139 and is thus subject to\nthe restrictions imposed by \u00a71324a(b)(5), namely, that this fact\ncannot be used by anyone for any purpose other than the few listed\nin that provision. Nevertheless, the court suggested that its\nholding did not sweep this broadly but was instead limited to the\nprosecution of aliens for using a false identity to establish\n\u201cemployment eligibility.\u201dId., at 1126, 1131, 401\nP.\u00a03d, at 596, 600.Justice Luckert concurred based on implied, not\nexpress, preemption. In her view, IRCA occupies \u201cthe field\u201d within\nwhich the prosecutions at issue fell, namely, \u201cthe use of false\ndocuments, including those using the identity of others, when an\nunauthorized alien seeks employment.\u201dId.at 1136, 401\nP.\u00a03d, at 602. Justice Luckert also opined that the Kansas\nstatutes, as applied in these cases, conflict with IRCA because\nthey \u201cusur[p] federal enforcement discretion\u201d regarding the\ntreatment of aliens who obtain employment even though they are\nbarred from doing so under federal law.Ibid., 401\nP.\u00a03d, at 603.Two members of the court, Justices Biles and\nStegall, dissented, and we granted review. 586 U.\u00a0S. ___\n(2019).IIThe Supremacy Clause provides that the\nConstitution, federal statutes, and treaties constitute \u201cthe\nsupreme Law of the Land.\u201d Art. VI, cl. 2. The Clause provides \u201ca\nrule of decision\u201d for determining whether federal or state law\napplies in a particular situation.Armstrongv.Exceptional Child Center, Inc., 575 U.S. 320, 324 (2015). If\nfederal law \u201cimposes restrictions or confers rights on private\nactors\u201d and \u201ca state law confers rights or imposes restrictions\nthat conflict with the federal law,\u201d \u201cthe federal law takes\nprecedence and the state law is preempted.\u201dMurphyv.National Collegiate Athletic Assn., 584 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___\n(2018) (slip op., at 22).In all cases, the federal restrictions or rights\nthat are said to conflict with state law must stem from either the\nConstitution itself or a valid statute enacted by Congress. \u201cThere\nis no federal preemptionin vacuo,\u201d without a constitutional\ntext, federal statute, or treaty made under the authority of the\nUnited States.Puerto Rico Dept. of Consumer Affairsv.ISLA Petroleum Corp.,485 U.S.\n495, 503 (1988); see alsoWhiting, 563 U.\u00a0S., at\n599 (preemption cannot be based on \u201ca \u2018freewheeling judicial\ninquiry into whether a state statute is in tension with federal\nobjectives.\u2019\u00a0\u201d) (citation omitted);Virginia Uranium,\nInc.v.Warren, 587 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2019) (lead\nopinion of Gorsuch, J.) (slip op., at 3) (\u201cInvoking some brooding\nfederal interest or appealing to a judicial policy preference\u201d does\nnot show preemption).In some cases, a federal statute may expressly\npreempt state law. SeePacific Gas & Elec. Co.v.State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Comm\u2019n,461 U.S.\n190, 203 (1983) (\u201cIt is well established that within\nconstitutional limits Congress may preempt state authority by so\nstating in express terms.\u201d). But it has long been established that\npreemption may also occur by virtue of restrictions or rights that\nare inferred from statutory law. See,e.g.,Osbornv.Bank of United States, 9 Wheat. 738, 865 (1824) (rejecting\nargument that a federal exemption from state regulation \u201cnot being\nexpressed, ought not to be implied by the Court\u201d). And recent cases\nhave often held state laws to be impliedly preempted. See,e.g.,Arizona567 U.\u00a0S., at 400\u2013408;Kurnsv.Railroad Friction Products Corp.,565 U.S.\n625, 630\u2013631 (2012);PLIVA, Inc.v.Mensing,564 U.S.\n604, 617\u2013618 (2011).In these cases, respondents do not contend that\nthe Kansas statutes under which they were convicted are preempted\nin their entirety. Instead, they argue that these laws must yield\nonly insofar as they apply to an unauthorized alien\u2019s use of false\ndocuments on forms submitted for the purpose of securing\nemployment. In making this argument, respondents invoke all three\ncategories of preemption identified in our cases. They defend the\nKansas Supreme Court\u2019s holding that provisions of IRCA expressly\nbar their prosecutions. And they also argue that the decision below\nis supported by \u201cfield\u201d or \u201cconflict\u201d preemption or some\ncombination of the two. We consider these arguments in turn.IIIWe begin with the argument that the state\ncriminal statutes under which respondents were convicted are\nexpressly preempted.As noted, IRCA contains a provision that\nexpressly preempts state law, but it is plainly inapplicable here.\nThat provision applies only to the imposition of criminal or civil\nliability onemployersand those who receive a fee for\nrecruiting or referring prospective employees. 8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a71324a(h)(2). It does not mention state or local laws that impose\ncriminal or civil sanctions on employees or applicants for\nemployment.The Kansas Supreme Court did not base its\nholding on this provision but instead turned to \u00a71324a(b)(5), which\nis far more than a preemption provision. This provision broadly\nrestrictsany useof an I\u20139, information contained in an\nI\u20139, and any documents appended to an I\u20139. Thus, unlike a typical\npreemption provision, it applies not just to the States but also to\nthe Federal Government and all private actors.The Kansas Supreme Court thought that the\nprosecutions in these cases ran afoul of this provision because the\ncharges were based on respondents\u2019 use in their W\u20134\u2019s and K\u20134\u2019s of\nthe same false Social Security numbers that they also inserted on\ntheir I\u20139\u2019s. Taken at face value, this theory would mean that no\ninformation placed on an I\u20139\u2014 including an employee\u2019s name,\nresidence address, date of birth, telephone number, and e-mail\naddress\u2014could ever be used by any entity or person for any\nreason.This interpretation is flatly contrary to\nstandard English usage. A tangible object can be \u201ccontained in\u201d\nonly one place at any point in time, but an item of information is\ndifferent. It may be \u201ccontained in\u201d many different places, and it\nis not customary to say that a person uses information that is\ncontained in a particular source unless the person makes use of\nthat source.Consider a person\u2019s e-mail address, one of the\nbits of information that is called for on an I\u20139. A person\u2019s e-mail\naddress may be \u201ccontained in\u201d a great many places. Individuals\noften provide their e-mail addresses to a wide circle of friends,\nacquaintances, online vendors, work-related contacts, and others.\nIn addition, the records of every recipient of an e-mail from a\nparticular person will contain that address.[2] In ordinary speech, no one would say that a\nperson who uses an e-mail address has used information that is\ncontained in all these places.Suppose that John used his e-mail address five\nyears ago to purchase a pair of shoes and that the vendor has that\naddress in its files. Suppose that John now sends an e-mail to Mary\nand that Mary sends an e-mail reply. No one would say that Mary has\nused information contained in the files of the shoe vendor.Or consider this bit of information: that the\nfirst man set foot on the moon on July 20, 1969.[3] That fact was reported in newspapers\naround the world, from Neil Armstrong\u2019s hometown newspaper, the\nWapakoneta (Ohio) Daily News[4]\nto the Soviet newspaper Izvestia.[5] Suppose that an elementary school student writes a\nreport in which she states that the first man walked on the moon in\n1969. No one would say that the student used information contained\nin the Wapakoneta Daily News or Izvestia if she never saw those\npublications.But it would be natural to say that the\nstudent used information contained in a book in the school library\nif that is where she got the information for her report.Accordingly, the mere fact that an I\u20139 contains\nan item of information, such as a name or address, does not mean\nthat information \u201ccontained in\u201d the I\u20139 is used whenever that name\nor address is later employed.If this were not so, strange consequences would\nensue. Recall that 8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71324a(b)(5) applies to the\nFederalGovernment. Under 26 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a77205,\nit is a crime to willfully supply false information on a W\u20134, and\nthis provision is not among those listed in 8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a71324a(b)(5). Thus, if an individual provided the same false\ninformation on an I\u20139 and a W\u20134, the Federal Government could not\nprosecute this individual under 26 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a77205 even if\nthe Government made no use whatsoever of the I\u20139. And that is just\nthe beginning.Suppose that an employee truthfully states on\nhis I\u20139 that his name is Jim Smith. Under the interpretation of 8\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71324a(b)(5) that the Kansas Supreme Court\nseemingly adopted, no one could use Jim\u2019s name for any purpose. If\nhe robbed a bank, prosecutors could not use his name in an\nindictment. His employer could not cut a paycheck using that name.\nHis sister could not use his name to mail him a birthday card.The Kansas Supreme Court tried to fend off these\nconsequences by suggesting that its interpretation applied only to\nthe prosecution of aliens for using a false identity to establish\n\u201cemployment eligibility.\u201d 306 Kan., at 1126, 401 P.\u00a03d, at\n596. But there is no trace of these limitations in the text of\n\u00a71324a(b)(5). The point need not be belabored any further: The\nargument that \u00a71324a(b)(5) expressly bars respondents\u2019 prosecutions\ncannot be defended.Apparently recognizing this, respondents turn to\n\u00a71324a(d)(2)(F), which prohibits use of the federal employment\nverification system[6] \u201cfor law\nenforcement purposes other than\u201d enforcement of IRCA and the same\nhandful of federal statutes mentioned in \u00a71324a(b)(5): 18\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71001 (false statements), \u00a71028 (identity\ntheft), \u00a71546 (immigration-document fraud), and \u00a71621\n(perjury).This argument fails because it rests on a\nmisunderstanding of the meaning of the federal \u201cemployment\nverification system.\u201d The sole function of that system is to\nestablish that an employee is not barred from working in this\ncountry due to alienage. As described in \u00a71324a(b), the system\nincludes the steps that an employee must take to establish that he\nor she is not prohibited from working, the steps that an employer\nmust take to verify the employee\u2019s status, and certain related\nmatters\u2014such as the preservation and copy- ing of records that are\nused to show authorization to work.The federal employment verification system does\nnot include things that an employee must or may do to satisfy\nrequirements unrelated to work authorization. And completing\ntax-withholding documents plays no part in the process of\ndetermining whether a person is authorized to work.[7] Instead, those documents are part of the\napparatus used to enforce federal and state income tax\nlaws.[8]For all these reasons, there is no express\npreemption in these cases.IVWe therefore proceed to consider respondents\u2019\nalternative argument that the Kansas laws, as applied, are\npreempted by implication. This argument, like all preemption\narguments, must be grounded \u201cin the text and structure of the\nstatute at issue.\u201dCSX Transp., Inc.v.Easterwood,507 U.S.\n658, 664 (1993).ARespondents contend, first, that the Kansas\nstatutes, as applied, fall into a field that is implicitly reserved\nexclusively for federal regulation. In rare cases, the Court has\nfound that Congress \u201clegislated so comprehensively\u201d in a particular\nfield that it \u201cleft no room for supplementary state legislation,\u201dR. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.v.Durham County,479 U.S.\n130, 140 (1986), but that is certainly not the situation\nhere.In order to determine whether Congress has\nimplicitly ousted the States from regulating in a particular field,\nwe must first identify the field in which this is said to have\noccurred. In their merits brief in this Court, respondents\u2019 primary\nsubmission is that IRCA preempts \u201cthe field of fraud on the federal\nemployment verification system,\u201d Brief for Respondents 41\n(quotation altered), but this argument fails because, as already\nexplained, the submission of tax- withholding forms is not part of\nthat system.At some points in their brief, respondents\ndefine the supposedly preempted field more broadly as the \u201cfieldrelating tothe federal employment verification system,\u201did., at 42 (emphasis added); see alsoid., at 40, but\nthis formulation does not rescue the argument. The submission of\ntax- withholding forms isfundamentally unrelatedto the\nfederal employment verification system because, as explained, those\nforms serve entirely different functions. The employment\nverification system is designed to prevent the employment of\nunauthorized aliens, whereas tax-withholding forms help to enforce\nincome tax laws. And using another person\u2019s Social Security number\non tax forms threatens harm that has no connection with immigration\nlaw.For instance, using another person\u2019s Social\nSecurity number on tax-withholding forms affects the wages reported\nto federal and state tax authorities. In addition, many\nbenefits\u2014such as those for disability, unemployment, and\nretirement\u2014are tied to an individual\u2019s work status and income.\nInaccurate data also affect the accuracy of a State\u2019s tax\ninformation.[9]It is true that employees generally complete\ntheir W\u20134\u2019s and K\u20134\u2019s at roughly the same time as their I\u20139\u2019s, but\nIRCA plainly does not foreclose all state regulation of information\nthat must be supplied as a precondition of employment. New\nemployees may be required by law to provide all sorts of\ninformation that has nothing to do with authorization to work in\nthe United States, such as information about age (for jobs with a\nminimum age requirement), educational degrees, licensing, criminal\nrecords, drug use, and personal information needed for a background\ncheck. IRCA surely does not preclude States from requiring and\nregulating the submission of all such information.Respondents suggest that federal law precludes\ntheir prosecutions because both the Kansas identity-theft statute\nand the Kansas false-information statute require proof that the\naccused engaged in the prohibited conduct for the purpose of\ngetting a \u201cbenefit.\u201d Their argument is as follows. Since the\nbenefit alleged by the prosecution in these cases was getting a\njob, and since the employment verification system concerns\nauthorization to work, the theory of respondents\u2019 prosecutions is\nrelated to that system.This argument conflates the benefit that results\nfrom complying with the federal employment verification system\n(verifying authorization to work in the United States) with the\nbenefit of actually getting a job. Submitting W\u20134\u2019s and K\u20134\u2019s\nhelped respondents get jobs, but this did not in any way assist\nthem in showing that they were authorized to work in this country.\nThus, respondents\u2019 \u201crelating to\u201d argument must be rejected, as must\nthe even broader definitions of the putatively preempted field\nadvanced by respondents at earlier points in this litigation.Contrary to respondents\u2019 suggestion, IRCA\ncertainly does not bar all state regulation regarding the \u201cuse of\nfalse documents .\u00a0.\u00a0. when an unauthorized alien seeks\nemployment.\u201d Brief in Opposition 21. Nor does IRCA exclude a State\nfrom the entire \u201cfield of employment verification.\u201dId., at\n22. For example, IRCA certainly does not prohibit a public school\nsystem from requiring applicants for teaching positions to furnish\nlegitimate teaching certificates. And it does not prevent a police\ndepartment from verifying that a prospective officer does not have\na record of abusive behavior.Respondents argue that field preemption in these\ncases \u201cfollows directly\u201d from our decision inArizona,567 U.S.\n387, Brief for Respondents 45\u201346, but that is not so. InArizona, relying on our prior decision inHinesv.Davidowitz,312 U.S.\n52(1941), we held that federal immigration law occupied the\nfield of alien registration. 567 U.\u00a0S., at 400\u2013402. \u201cFederal\nlaw,\u201d we observed, \u201cmakes a single sovereign responsible for\nmaintaining a comprehensive and unified system to keep track of\naliens within the Nation\u2019s borders.\u201dId., at 401\u2013402. But\nfederal law does not create a comprehensive and unified system\nregarding the information that a State may require employees to\nprovide.In sum, there is no basis for finding field\npreemption in these cases.BWe likewise see no ground for holding that the\nKansas statutes at issue conflict with federal law. It is certainly\npossible to comply with both IRCA and the Kansas statutes, and\nrespondents do not suggest otherwise. They instead maintain that\nthe Kansas statutes, as applied in their prosecutions, stand as \u201can\nobstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes\u201d\nof IRCA\u2014one of which is purportedly that the initiation of any\nlegal action against an unauthorized alien for using a false\nidentity in applying for employment should rest exclusively within\nthe prosecutorial discretion of federal authorities. Brief for\nRespondents 49\u201355. Allowing Kansas to bring prosecutions like\nthese, according to respondents, would risk upsetting federal\nenforcement priorities and frustrating federal objectives, such as\nobtaining the cooperation of unauthorized aliens in making bigger\ncases.Ibid.Respondents analogize these cases to our holding\ninArizona, 567 U.\u00a0S., at 404\u2013407\u2014that a state law\nmaking it a crime for an unauthorized alien to obtain employment\nconflicted with IRCA, which does not criminalize that conduct\u2014but\nrespondents\u2019 analogy is unsound. InArizona, the Court\ninferred that Congress had made a considered decision that it was\ninadvisable to criminalize the conduct in question. In effect, the\nCourt concluded that IRCA implicitly conferred a right to be free\nof criminal (as opposed to civil) penalties for working illegally,\nand thus a state law making it a crime to engage in that conduct\nconflicted with this federal right.Nothing similar is involved here. In enacting\nIRCA, Congress did not decide that an unauthorized alien who uses a\nfalse identity on tax-withholding forms should not face criminal\nprosecution. On the contrary, federal law makes it a crime to use\nfraudulent information on a W\u20134. 26 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a77205.The mere fact that state laws like the Kansas\nprovisions at issue overlap to some degree with federal criminal\nprovisions does not even begin to make a case for conflict\npreemption. From the beginning of our country, criminal law\nenforcement has been primarily a responsibility of the States, and\nthat remains true today. In recent times, the reach of federal\ncriminal law has expanded, and there are now many instances in\nwhich a prosecution for a particular course of conduct could be\nbrought by either federal or state prosecutors. Our federal system\nwould be turned upside down if we were to hold that federal\ncriminal law preempts state law whenever they overlap, and there is\nno basis for inferring that federal criminal statutes preempt state\nlaws whenever they overlap. Indeed, in the vast majority of cases\nwhere federal and state laws overlap, allowing the States to\nprosecute is entirely consistent with federal interests.In the present cases, there is certainly no\nsuggestion that the Kansas prosecutions frustrated any federal\ninterests. Federal authorities played a role in all three cases,\nand the Federal Government fully supports Kansas\u2019s position in this\nCourt. In the end, however, the possibility that federal\nenforcement priorities might be upset is not enough to provide a\nbasis for preemption. The Supremacy Clause gives priority to \u201cthe\nLaws of the United States,\u201d not the criminal law enforcement\npriorities or preferences of federal officers. Art. VI, cl. 2.Finally, contrary to respondents\u2019 suggestion,\nthese cases are very different fromBuckman Co.v.Plaintiffs\u2019 Legal Comm.,531 U.S.\n341(2001), andWisconsin Dept. of Industryv.Gould\nInc.,475 U.S.\n282(1986). InBuckman Co., the preempted state tort\nclaim for fraud on the Food and Drug Administration threatened\nserious disruption of the sensitive and highly technical process of\napproving medical devices. 531 U.\u00a0S., at 347\u2013353. In these\ncases, the state prosecutions posed no comparable risk.InGould, the decision rested on a\nspecial preemption rule governing state laws regulating matters\nthat the National Labor Relations Act \u201cprotects, prohibits, or\narguably protects.\u201d 475 U.\u00a0S., at 286\u2013289;San Diego\nBuilding Trades Councilv.Garmon,359 U.S.\n236, 246 (1959). No similar rule is operative or appropriate\nhere.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*For these reasons, the judgments of the\nSupreme Court of Kansas are reversed, and these cases are remanded\nfor further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.Notes1In Morales\u2019s bench trial,\nthe State also introduced into evidence his I\u20139 and a photocopy of\na permanent resident card and Social Security card that was\nappended to his I\u20139. App. 152\u2013154, 178\u2013179. The trial court,\nhowever, explicitly assured Morales that it would not make any\nfindings based on the I\u20139, and defense counsel did not further\nobject to the introduction of the I\u20139 into evidence.Id.,at\n150\u2013151. Before the state appellate courts, Morales did not argue\nthat admitting the I\u20139 and photocopy was error. Nor did his brief\nin opposition to certiorari argue that the admission of these\nexhibits provided a ground for relief under federal law.

There is no other system to which this reference could\nplausibly refer.7Moreover, these documents\nare not always submitted when an employee begins a job.

This subsection, which is part of a provision that\ncriminalizes certain conduct relating to immigration and\nauthorization to work, provides that the section \u201cdoes not prohibit\nany lawfully authorized investigative, protective, or intelligence\nactivity\u201d of a federal or state law enforcement agency, a federal\nintelligence agency, or others engaged in certain activity relating\nto the prosecution of organized crime. How this provision can be\nseen as expressly barring respondents\u2019 prosecutions is a\nmystery.9See,e.g., Kansas\nDept. of Revenue, Annual Reports,\nwww.ksrevenue.org/prannualreport.html; Kansas Dept. of Revenue, Tax\nFraud Enforcement, www.ksrevenue.org/taxfraud.html.",
