That separate\nfirearm offense carries a mandatory minimum sentence of five years\nfor the first conviction and 25 years for a second. Those sentences\nmust be in addition to and consecutive to the sentence for the\nunderlying predicate offense. The question presented is whether, in\ncalculating the sentence for the predicate offense, a judge must\nignore the fact that the defendant will serve the mandatory\nminimums imposed under \u00a7924(c).ILevon Dean, Jr., and his brother robbed a\nmethamphetamine dealer in a Sioux City motel room. Less than two\nweeks later, they robbed another drug dealer at his home. During\neach robbery, Dean\u2019s brother threatened the victim with a modified\nsemiautomatic rifle, later using that rifle to club the victim on\nthe head. Dean, meanwhile, ransacked the area for drugs, money, and\nother valuables.A federal grand jury returned a multicount\nindictment charging Dean and his brother with a host of crimes\nrelated to the two robberies. Following a joint trial, a jury\nconvicted Dean of one count of conspiracy to commit robbery, two\ncounts of robbery, and one count of possessing a firearm as a\nconvicted felon. He was also convicted of two counts of possessing\nand aiding and abetting the possession of a firearm in furtherance\nof a crime of violence, in violation of 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a72\nand 924(c). Section 924(c) criminalizes using or carrying a firearm\nduring and in relation to a crime of violence or drug trafficking\ncrime, or possessing a firearm in furtherance of such an underlying\ncrime. There is no dispute that Dean\u2019s two robbery convictions\nqualified as predicate crimes of violence for purposes of\n\u00a7924(c).Section 924(c) does more than create a distinct\noffense. It also mandates a distinct penalty, one that must be\nimposed \u201cin additiontothe punishment provided for\n[the predicate] crime of violence or drug trafficking crime.\u201d\n\u00a7924(c)(1)(A) (emphasis added). A first-time offender under \u00a7924(c)\nreceives a five-year mandatory minimum. A \u201csecond or subsequent\nconviction\u201d under \u00a7924(c) carries an additional 25-year mandatory\nminimum. \u00a7\u00a7924(c)(1)(A)(i), (C)(i).A sentence imposed under \u00a7924(c) must run\nconsecutively to \u201cany other term of imprisonment imposed on the\nperson,\u201d including any sentence for the predicate crime \u201cduring\nwhich the firearm was used, carried, or possessed.\u201d\n\u00a7924(c)(1)(D)(ii). For Dean, this meant a 30-year mandatory\nminimum, to be served after and in addition to any sentence he\nreceived for his other counts of conviction.At sentencing Dean did not dispute that each of\nhis four other counts resulted in a sentencing range of 84\u2013105\nmonths under the Sentencing Guidelines. He argued, however, that\nthe court should consider his lengthy mandatory minimum sentences\nwhen calculating the sentences for his other counts, and impose\nconcurrent one-day sentences for those counts.Finding that Dean was \u201cclearly the follower\u201d and\nthat he lacked \u201cany significant history of any violence,\u201d the\nDistrict Judge agreed that 30 years plus one day was \u201cmore than\nsufficient for a sentence in this case.\u201d App. 26. Yet the judge\nunderstood \u00a7924(c) to preclude such a sentence. In his view, he was\nrequired to disregard Dean\u2019s 30-year mandatory minimum when\ndetermining the appropriate sentences for Dean\u2019s other counts of\nconviction. Viewed on their own\u2014and not as part of a combined\npackage\u2014those counts plainly warranted sentences longer than one\nday. In the end, the judge still granted a significant downward\nvariance from the 84\u2013105 month Guidelines range. Dean received\nconcurrent sentences of 40 months for each non-\u00a7924(c) conviction,\nwhich, when added to his 360-month mandatory minimum, yielded a\ntotal sentence of 400 months. Dean appealed.Before the Eighth Circuit, Dean argued that the\nDistrict Court had erred in concluding that it could not vary from\nthe Guidelines range based on the mandatory minimum sentences he\nwould receive under \u00a7924(c). The Court of Appeals disagreed, ruling\nthat Dean\u2019s argument was foreclosed by Circuit precedent and that\nhis sentence was otherwise substantively reasonable. 810 F.\u00a03d\n521 (2015). We granted certiorari. 580 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2016).IISentencing courts have long enjoyed discretion\nin the sort of information they may consider when setting an\nappropriate sentence.Pepperv.United States, 562\nU.\u00a0S. 476 \u2013489 (2011). This durable tradition remains, even as\nfederal laws have required sentencing courts to evaluate certain\nfactors when exercising their discretion.Ibid.ASection 3553(a) of Title 18 specifies the\nfactors courts are to consider in imposing a sentence. The list of\nfactors is preceded by what is known as the parsimony principle, a\nbroad command that instructs courts to \u201cimpose a sentence\nsufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with\u201d the\nfour identified purposes of sentencing: just punishment,\ndeterrence, protection of the public, and rehabilitation.Ibid.A sentencing court is then directed to take into\naccount \u201cthe nature and circumstances of the offense and the\nhistory and characteristics of the defendant,\u201d as well as \u201cthe need\nfor the sentence imposed\u201d to serve the four overarching aims of\nsentencing. \u00a7\u00a73553(a)(1), (2)(A)\u2013(D); seeGallv.United\nStates, 552 U.\u00a0S. 38 , n.\u00a06 (2007). The court must\nalso consider the pertinent guidelines and policies adopted by the\nSentencing Commission. \u00a7\u00a73553(a)(4), (5); seeid., at 50,\nn.\u00a06.The \u00a73553(a) factors are used to set both the\nlength of separate prison terms and an aggregate prison term\ncomprising separate sentences for multiple counts of conviction.\nUnder \u00a73582 a court, \u201cin determining whether to impose a term of\nimprisonment, and, if a term of imprisonment is to be imposed, in\ndetermining the length of the term, shall consider the factors set\nforth in section 3553(a).\u201d \u00a73582(a). And \u00a73584 provides: \u201c[I]n\ndetermining whether the terms imposed are to be ordered to run\nconcurrently or consecutively, [the court] shall consider, as to\neach offense for which a term of imprisonment is being imposed, the\nfactors set forth in section 3553(a).\u201d \u00a73584(b).As a general matter, the foregoing provisions\npermit a court imposing a sentence on one count of conviction to\nconsider sentences imposed on other counts. Take the directive that\na court assess \u201cthe need for the sentence imposed .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nto protect the public from further crimes of the defendant.\u201d\n\u00a73553(a)(2)(C). Dean committed the two robberies at issue here when\nhe was 23 years old. That he will not be released from prison until\nwell after his fiftieth birthday because of the \u00a7924(c) convictions\nsurely bears on whether\u2014in connection with his predicate\ncrimes\u2014still more incarceration is necessary to protect the public.\nLikewise, in considering \u201cthe need for the sentence imposed\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. to afford adequate deterrence,\u201d \u00a73553(a)(2)(B), the\nDistrict Court could not reasonably ignore the deterrent effect of\nDean\u2019s 30-year mandatory minimum.According to the Government, this is not how\nsentencing is meant to work. Rather, district courts should\ncalculate the appropriate term of imprisonment for each individual\noffense. That determination, insists the Government, disregards\nwhatever sentences the defendant may also face on other counts. Not\nuntil deciding whether to run sentences consecutively or\nconcurrently\u2014i.e.,not until applying \u00a73584\u2014should a\ndistrict court consider the effect of those other sentences. Brief\nfor United States 21\u201326.Nothing in the law requires such an approach.\nThe Government states that the \u00a73553(a) factors are \u201cnormally\nrelevant in determining the total length of imprisonment\u201d under\n\u00a73584.Id., at 28. No doubt they are. But there is no reason\nthey may not also be considered at the front end, when determining\na prison sentence for each individual offense in a multicount\ncase.At odds with the text, the Government\u2019s\ninterpretation is also at odds with its own practice in \u201csentencing\npackage cases.\u201dGreenlawv.United States, 554\nU.\u00a0S. 237, 253 (2008) . \u201cThose cases typically involve\nmulticount indictments and a successful attack by a defendant on\nsome but not all of the counts of conviction.\u201dIbid.In\nthose cases\u2014including ones where \u00a7924(c) convictions are\ninvalidated\u2014the Government routinely argues that an appellate court\nshould vacate the entire sentence so that the district court may\nincrease the sentences for any remaining counts up to the limit set\nby the original aggregate sentence. SeeUnited Statesv.Smith, 756 F.\u00a03d 1179, 1188\u20131189, and n. 5 (CA10 2014)\n(collecting cases). And appellate courts routinely agree.Id., at 1189, and n.\u00a06 (same). As we understand it, the\nGovernment\u2019s theory in those cases is that the district court may\nhave relied on a now-vacated conviction when imposing sentences for\nthe other counts. But that theory of course directly contradicts\nthe position the Government now advances\u2014that district courts must\ndetermine sentences independently of one another, accounting for\nmultiple sentences only when deciding whether to stack them or run\nthem concurrently.BNothing in \u00a7924(c) restricts the authority\nconferred on sentencing courts by \u00a73553(a) and the related\nprovisions to consider a sentence imposed under \u00a7924(c) when\ncalculating a just sentence for the predicate count.The Government points to two limitations in\n\u00a7924(c). First, the Government notes, a mandatory sentence under\n\u00a7924(c) must be imposed \u201cin additiontothe\npunishment provided\u201d for the predicate crime. \u00a7924(c)(1)(A)\n(emphasis added). This limitation says nothing about the length of\na non-\u00a7924(c) sentence, much less about what information a court\nmay consider in determining that sentence. Whether the sentence for\nthe predicate offense is one day or one decade, a district court\ndoes not violate the terms of \u00a7924(c) so long as it imposes the\nmandatory minimum \u201cin addition to\u201d the sentence for the violent or\ndrug trafficking crime.Second, \u00a7924(c) states that \u201cno term of\nimprisonment imposed on a person under this subsection shall run\nconcurrently with any other term of imprisonment imposed on the\nperson, including any term of imprisonment imposed for the\n[predicate] crime during which the firearm was used, carried, or\npossessed.\u201d \u00a7924(c)(1)(D)(ii). Nothing in that language prevents a\ndistrict court from imposing a 30-year mandatory minimum sentence\nunder \u00a7924(c) and a one-day sentence for the predicate violent or\ndrug trafficking crime, provided those terms run one after the\nother. The Government emphasizes that the requirement of\nconsecutive sentences removes the discretion to run sentences\nconcurrently that district courts exercise under \u00a73584. We agree.\nSo does Dean, for that matter. But we fail to see the significance\nof the point. The bar on imposing concurrent sentences does not\naffect a court\u2019s discretion to consider a mandatory minimum when\ncalculating each individual sentence.The Government would, in effect, have us read an\nadditional limitation into \u00a7924(c): Where \u00a7924(c) says \u201cin addition\nto the punishment provided for [the predicate] crime of violence,\u201d\nwhat the statutereallymeans is \u201cin addition to the\npunishment provided for [the predicate] crime of violencein the\nabsence of a Section 924(c) conviction.\u201d See Reply Brief 2. We\nhave said that \u201c[d]rawing meaning from silence is particularly\ninappropriate\u201d where \u201cCongress has shown that it knows how to\ndirect sentencing practices in express terms.\u201dKimbroughv.United States, 552 U.\u00a0S. 85, 103 (2007) . Congress has\nshown just that in another statute, 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71028A.\nThat section, which criminalizes the commission of identity theft\n\u201cduring and in relation to\u201d certain predicate felonies, imposes a\nmandatory minimum sentence \u201cin addition to the punishment provided\nfor\u201d the underlying offense. \u00a71028A(a)(1). It also says that the\nmandatory minimum must be consecutive to the sentence for the\nunderlying offense. \u00a71028A(b)(2). So far, \u00a71028A tracks \u00a7924(c) in\nrelevant respects. But \u00a71028A goes further: It provides that in\ndetermining the appropriate length of imprisonment for the\npredicate felony \u201ca court shall not in any way reduce the term to\nbe imposed for such crime so as to compensate for, or otherwise\ntake into account, any separate term of imprisonment imposed or to\nbe imposed for a violation of this section.\u201d \u00a71028A(b)(3). Section\n1028A says just what the Government reads \u00a7924(c) to say\u2014of course,\nwithoutactuallysaying it.The Government responds that \u00a71028A was passed\nin 2004, long after Congress enacted the 1984 amendments creating\nthe current sentencing regime in \u00a7924(c). Brief for United States\n46. True. But \u00a71028A confirms that it would have been easy enough\nto make explicit what the Government argues is implicit in \u00a7924(c).\nIt also underscores that for over a decade Congress has been aware\nof a clear way to bar consideration of a mandatory minimum, but\nnever during that time changed the language of \u00a7924(c) to mirror\nthat of \u00a71028A, even as it has amended other aspects of\n\u00a7924(c).*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*The Government speaks of Congress\u2019s intent to\nprevent district courts from bottoming out sentences for predicate\n\u00a7924(c) offenses whenever they think a mandatory minimum under\n\u00a7924(c) is already punishment enough. But no such intent finds\nexpression in the language of \u00a7924(c). That language simply\nrequires any mandatory minimum under \u00a7924(c) to be imposed \u201cin\naddition to\u201d the sentence for the predicate offense, and to run\nconsecutively to that sentence. Nothing in those requirements\nprevents a sentencing court from considering a mandatory minimum\nunder \u00a7924(c) when calculating an appropriate sentence for the\npredicate offense.The judgment of the United States Court of\nAppeals for the Eighth Circuit is reversed, and the case is\nremanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.",
