That standard\nmay be different for new and existing plants, but in each case it\nmust reflect the \u201cbest system of emission reduction\u201d that the\nAgency has determined to be \u201cadequately demonstrated\u201d for the\nparticular category. \u00a7\u00a77411(a)(1), (b)(1), (d). For existing\nplants, the States then implement that requirement by issuing rules\nrestricting emissions from sources within their borders.Since passage of the Act 50 years ago, EPA has\nexercised this authority by setting performance standards based on\nmeasures that would reduce pollution by causing plants to operate\nmore cleanly. In 2015, however, EPA issued a new rule concluding\nthat the \u201cbest system of emission reduction\u201d for existing\ncoal-fired power plants included a requirement that such facilities\nreduce their own production of electricity, or subsidize increased\ngeneration by natural gas, wind, or solar sources.The question before us is whether this broader\nconception of EPA\u2019s authority is within the power granted to it by\nthe Clean Air Act.IAThe Clean Air Act establishes three main\nregulatory programs to control air pollution from stationary\nsources such as power plants. Clean Air Amendments of 1970, 84Stat.\n1676, 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a77401et\u00a0seq.One program\nis the New Source Performance Standards program of Section 111, at\nissue here. The other two are the National Ambient Air Quality\nStandards (NAAQS) program, set out in Sections 108 through 110 of\nthe Act, 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a77408\u20137410, and the Hazardous Air\nPollutants (HAP) program, set out in Section 112, \u00a77412. To\nunderstand the place and function of Section 111 in the statutory\nscheme, some background on the other two programs is in order.The NAAQS program addresses air pollutants that\n\u201cmay reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or\nwelfare,\u201d and \u201cthe presence of which in the ambient air results\nfrom numerous or diverse mobile or stationary sources.\u201d\n\u00a77408(a)(1). After identifying such pollutants, EPA establishes a\nNAAQS for each. The NAAQS represents \u201cthe maximum airborne\nconcentration of [the] pollutant that the public health can\ntolerate.\u201dWhitmanv.American Trucking Assns.,Inc.,531 U.S.\n457, 465 (2001); see \u00a77409(b). EPA, though, does not choose\nwhich sources must reduce their pollution and by how much to meet\nthe ambient pollution target. Instead, Section 110 of the Act\nleaves that task in the first instance to the States, requiring\neach \u201cto submit to [EPA] a plan designed to implement and maintain\nsuch standards within its boundaries.\u201dTrainv.Natural\nResources Defense Council,Inc.,421 U.S.\n60, 65 (1975); \u00a77410.The second major program governing stationary\nsources is the HAP program. The HAP program primarily targets\npollutants, other than those already covered by a NAAQS, that\npresent \u201ca threat of adverse human health effects,\u201d including\nsubstances known or anticipated to be \u201ccarcinogenic, mutagenic,\nteratogenic, neurotoxic,\u201d or otherwise \u201cacutely or chronically\ntoxic.\u201d \u00a77412(b)(2).EPA\u2019s regulatory role with respect to these\ntoxic pollutants is different in kind from its role in\nadministering the NAAQS program. There, EPA is generally limited to\ndetermining the maximum safe amount of covered pollutants in the\nair. As to each hazardous pollutant, by contrast, the Agency must\npromulgate emissions standards for both new and existing major\nsources. \u00a77412(d)(1). Those standards must \u201crequire the maximum\ndegree of reduction in emissions .\u00a0.\u00a0. that the [EPA]\nAdministrator, taking into consideration the cost of achieving such\nemission reduction, and any non-air quality health and\nenvironmental impacts and energy requirements, determines is\nachievable .\u00a0.\u00a0. through application of measures,\nprocesses, methods, systems or techniques\u201d of emission reduction.\n\u00a77412(d)(2). In other words, EPA must directly require all covered\nsources to reduce their emissions to a certain level. And it\nchooses that level by determining the \u201cmaximum degree of reduction\u201d\nit considers \u201cachievable\u201d in practice by using the best existing\ntechnologies and methods. \u00a77412(d)(3).Thus, in the parlance of environmental law,\nSection 112 directs the Agency to impose \u201ctechnology-basedstandard[s] for hazardous emissions,\u201dAlaska Dept. of\nEnvironmental Conservationv.EPA, 540 U.S. 461, 485,\nn.\u00a012 (2004) (emphasis added). This sort of\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018technology-based\u2019 approach focuses upon the control\ntechnologies that are available to industrial entities and requires\nthe agency to .\u00a0.\u00a0. ensur[e] that regulated firms adopt\nthe appropriate cleanup technology.\u201d T. McGarity, Media-Quality,\nTechnology, and Cost-Benefit Balancing Strategies for Health and\nEnvironmental Regulation, 46 Law & Contemp. Prob. 159, 160\n(Summer 1983) (McGarity). (Such \u201ctechnologies\u201d are not limited to\nliteral technology, such as scrubbers; \u201cchanges in the design and\noperation\u201d of the facility, or \u201cin the way that employees perform\ntheir tasks,\u201d are also available options.Id., at 163,\nn.\u00a018.)The third air pollution control scheme is the\nNew Source Performance Standards program of Section 111. \u00a77411.\nThat section directs EPA to list \u201ccategories of stationary sources\u201d\nthat it determines \u201ccause[\u00a0], or contribute[\u00a0]\nsignificantly to, air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated\nto endanger public health or welfare.\u201d \u00a77411(b)(1)(A). Under\nSection 111(b), the Agency must then promulgate for each category\n\u201cFederal standards of performance for new sources,\u201d \u00a77411(b)(1)(B).\nA \u201cstandard of performance\u201d is one that\u201creflects the degree of emission\nlimitation achievable through the application of the best system of\nemission reduction which (taking into account the cost of achieving\nsuch reduction and any nonair quality health and environmental\nimpact and energy requirements) the [EPA] Administrator determines\nhas been adequately demonstrated.\u201d \u00a77411(a)(1).Thus, the statute directs EPA to (1)\n\u201cdetermine[\u00a0],\u201d taking into account various factors, the \u201cbest\nsystem of emission reduction which .\u00a0.\u00a0. has been\nadequately demonstrated,\u201d (2)\u00a0ascertain the \u201cdegree of\nemission limitation achievable through the application\u201d of that\nsystem, and (3) impose an emissions limit on new stationary sources\nthat \u201creflects\u201d that amount.Ibid.; see also 80 Fed. Reg.\n64538 (2015). Generally speaking, a source may achieve that\nemissions cap any way it chooses; the key is that its pollution be\nno more than the amount \u201cachievable through the application of the\nbest system of emission reduction .\u00a0.\u00a0. adequately\ndemonstrated,\u201d or the BSER. \u00a77411(a)(1); see \u00a77411(b)(5). EPA\nundertakes this analysis on a pollutant-by-pollutant basis,\nestablishing different standards of performance with respect to\ndifferent pollutants emitted from the same source category. See,e.g., 73 Fed. Reg. 35838 (2008); 42 Fed. Reg. 22510\n(1977).Although the thrust of Section 111 focuses on\nemissions limits fornewandmodifiedsources\u2014as its\ntitle indicates\u2014the statute also authorizes regulation of certain\npollutants fromexistingsources. Under Section 111(d), once\nEPA \u201chas setnewsource standards addressing emissions of a\nparticular pollutant under .\u00a0.\u00a0. section 111(b),\u201d 80 Fed.\nReg. 64711, it must then address emissions of that same pollutant\nby existing sources\u2014but only if they are not already regulated\nunder the NAAQS or HAP programs. \u00a77411(d)(1). Existing power\nplants, for example, emit many pollutants covered by a NAAQS or HAP\nstandard. Section 111(d) thus \u201coperates as a gap-filler,\u201d\nempowering EPA to regulate harmful emissions not already controlled\nunder the Agency\u2019s other authorities.American Lung Assn.v.EPA, 985 F.3d 914, 932 (CADC 2021).Although the States set the actual rules\ngoverning existing power plants, EPA itself still retains the\nprimary regulatory role in Section 111(d). The Agency, not the\nStates, decides the amount of pollution reduction that must\nultimately be achieved. It does so by again determining, as when\nsetting the new source rules, \u201cthe best system of emission\nreduction .\u00a0.\u00a0. that has been adequately demonstrated for\n[existing covered] facilities.\u201d 40 CFR \u00a760.22(b)(5) (2021); see\nalso 80 Fed. Reg. 64664, and n.\u00a01. The States then submit\nplans containing the emissions restrictions that they intend to\nadopt and enforce in order not to exceed the permissible level of\npollution established by EPA. See \u00a7\u00a760.23, 60.24; 42\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a77411(d)(1).Reflecting the ancillary nature of Section\n111(d), EPA has used it only a handful of times since the enactment\nof the statute in 1970. See 80 Fed. Reg. 64703, and n.\u00a0275\n(past regulations pertained to \u201cfour pollutants from five source\ncategories\u201d). For instance, the Agency has established emissions\nlimits on acid mist from sulfuric acid production, 41 Fed. Reg.\n48706 (1976) (identifying \u201cfiber mist eliminator\u201d technology as\nBSER); sulfide gases released by kraft pulp mills, 44 Fed. Reg.\n29829 (1979) (determining BSER to be a combination of scrubbers,\nincineration, filtration systems, and temperature control); and\nemissions of various harmful gases from municipal landfills, 61\nFed. Reg. 9907 (1996) (setting BSER as use of a flare to combust\nthe gases). It was thus only a slight overstatement for one of the\narchitects of the 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act to refer to\nSection 111(d) as an \u201cobscure, never-used section of the law.\u201d\nHearings on S. 300 et\u00a0al. before the Subcommittee on\nEnvironmental Protection of the Senate Committee on Environment and\nPublic Works, 100th Cong., 1st Sess., 13 (1987) (remarks of Sen.\nDurenberger).BThings changed in October 2015, when EPA\npromulgated two rules addressing carbon dioxide pollution from\npower plants\u2014one for new plants under Section 111(b), the other for\nexisting plants under Section 111(d). Both were premised on the\nAgency\u2019s earlier finding that carbon dioxide is an \u201cair pollutant\u201d\nthat \u201cmay reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or\nwelfare\u201d by causing climate change. 80 Fed. Reg. 64530. Carbon\ndioxide is not subject to a NAAQS and has not been listed as a\ntoxic pollutant.The first rule announced by EPA established\nfederal carbon emissions limits for new power plants of two\nvarieties: fossil-fuel-fired electric steam generating units\n(mostly coal fired) and natural-gas-fired stationary combustion\nturbines.Id., at 64512. Following the statutory process set\nout above, the Agency determined the BSER for the two categories of\nsources. For steam generating units, for instance, EPA determined\nthat the BSER was a combination of high-efficiency production\nprocesses and carbon capture technology. See 80 Fed. Reg. 64512.\nEPA then set the emissions limit based on the amount of carbon\ndioxide that a plant would emit with these technologies in place.Id., at 64513.The second rule was triggered by the first:\nBecause EPA was now regulating carbon dioxide fromnewcoal\nand gas plants, Section 111(d) required EPA to also address carbon\nemissions fromexistingcoal and gas plants. See\n\u00a77411(d)(1). It did so through what it called the Clean Power Plan\nrule.In that rule, EPA established \u201cfinal emission\nguidelines for states to follow in developing plans\u201d to regulate\nexisting power plants within their borders.Id., at 64662.\nTo arrive at the guideline limits, EPA did the same thing it does\nwhen imposing federal regulations on new sources: It identified the\nBSER.The BSER that the Agency selected for existing\ncoal-fired power plants, however, was quite different from the BSER\nit had chosen for new sources. The BSER for existing plants\nincluded three types of measures, which the Agency called \u201cbuilding\nblocks.\u201dId., at 64667. The first building block was \u201cheat\nrate improvements\u201d at coal-fired plants\u2014essentially practices such\nplants could undertake to burn coal more efficiently.Id.,\nat 64727.But such improvements, EPA stated, would \u201clead to\nonly small emission reductions,\u201d because coal-fired power plants\nwere already operating near optimum efficiency.Ibid.On the\nAgency\u2019s view, \u201cmuch larger emission reductions [were] needed from\n[coal-fired plants] to address climate change.\u201dIbid.So the Agency included two additional building\nblocks in its BSER, both of which involve what it called\n\u201cgeneration shifting from higher-emitting to lower-emitting\u201d\nproducers of electricity.Id., at 64728. Building block two\nwas a shift in electricity production from existing coal-fired\npower plants to natural-gas-fired plants.Ibid.Because\nnatural gas plants produce \u201ctypically less than half as much\u201d\ncarbon dioxide per unit of electricity created as coal-fired\nplants, the Agency explained, \u201cthis generation shift [would]\nreduce[] CO2 emissions.\u201dIbid.Building block three worked\nthe same way, except that the shift was from both coal- and\ngas-fired plants to \u201cnew low- or zero-carbon generating capacity,\u201d\nmainly wind and solar.Id., at 64729, 64748. \u201cMost of the\nCO2 controls\u201d in the rule came from the application of building\nblocks two and three.Id., at 64728.The Agency identified three ways in which a\nregulated plant operator could implement a shift in generation to\ncleaner sources.Id., at 64731. First, an operator could\nsimply reduce the regulated plant\u2019s own production of electricity.\nSecond, it could build a new natural gas plant, wind farm, or solar\ninstallation, or invest in someone else\u2019s existing facility and\nthen increase generation there.Ibid.Finally, operators\ncould purchase emission allowances or credits as part of a\ncap-and-trade regime.Id., at 64731\u201364732. Under such a\nscheme, sources that achieve a reduction in their emissions can\nsell a credit representing the value of that reduction to others,\nwho are able to count it toward their own applicable emissions\ncaps.EPA explained that taking any of these steps\nwould implement a sector-wide shift in electricity production from\ncoal to natural gas and renewables.Id., at 64731. Given the\nintegrated nature of the power grid, \u201cadding electricity to the\ngrid from one generator will result in the instantaneous reduction\nin generation from other generators,\u201d and \u201creductions in generation\nfrom one generator lead to the instantaneous increase in\ngeneration\u201d by others.Id., at 64769. So coal plants,\nwhether by reducing their own production, subsidizing an increase\nin production by cleaner sources, or both, would cause a shift\ntoward wind, solar, and natural gas.Having decided that the \u201cbest system of emission\nreduction .\u00a0.\u00a0. adequately demonstrated\u201d was one that\nwould reduce carbon pollution mostly by moving production to\ncleaner sources, EPA then set about determining \u201cthe degree of\nemission limitation achievable through the application\u201d of that\nsystem. 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a77411(a)(1). The Agency recognized\nthat\u2014given the nature of generation shifting\u2014it could choose from\n\u201ca wide range of potential stringencies for the BSER.\u201d 80 Fed. Reg.\n64730. Put differently, in translating the BSER into an operational\nemissions limit, EPA could choose whether to require anything from\na little generation shifting to a great deal. The Agency settled on\nwhat it regarded as a \u201creasonable\u201d amount of shift, which it based\non modeling of how much more electricity both natural gas and\nrenewable sources could supply without causing undue cost increases\nor reducing the overall power supply.Id., at 64797\u201364811.\nBased on these changes, EPA projected that by 2030, it would be\nfeasible to have coal provide 27% of national electricity\ngeneration, down from 38% in 2014.Id., at 64665, 64694; see\nDept. of Energy, U.\u00a0S. Energy Information Admin., Monthly\nEnergy Review (May 2015), Electricity Net Generation: Electric\nPower Sector, p.\u00a0106 (Table 7.2b).From these significant projected reductions in\ngeneration, EPA developed a series of complex equations to\n\u201cdetermine the emission performance rates\u201d that States would be\nrequired to implement. 80 Fed. Reg. 64815. The calculations\nresulted in numerical emissions ceilings so strict that no existing\ncoal plant would have been able to achieve them without engaging in\none of the three means of shifting generation described above.\nIndeed, the emissions limit the Clean Power Plan established for\nexisting power plants was actuallystricterthan the cap\nimposed by the simultaneously published standards fornewplants. Compareid., at 64742, withid., at\n64513.The point, after all, was to compel the transfer\nof power generating capacity from existing sources to wind and\nsolar. The White House stated that the Clean Power Plan would\n\u201cdrive a[n] .\u00a0.\u00a0. aggressive transformation in the\ndomestic energy industry.\u201d White House Fact Sheet, App. inAmerican Lung Assn. v.EPA, No. 19\u20131140 etc. (CADC),\np.\u00a02076. EPA\u2019s own modeling concluded that the rule would\nentail billions of dollars in compliance costs (to be paid in the\nform of higher energy prices), require the retirement of dozens of\ncoal-fired plants, and eliminate tens of thousands of jobs across\nvarious sectors. EPA, Regulatory Impact Analysis for the Clean\nPower Plan Final Rule 3\u201322, 3\u201330, 3\u201333, 6\u201324, 6\u201325 (2015). The\nEnergy Information Administration reached similar conclusions,\nprojecting that the rule would cause retail electricity prices to\nremain persistently 10% higher in many States, and would reduce GDP\nby at least a trillion 2009 dollars by 2040. Dept. of Energy,\nAnalysis of the Impacts of the Clean Power Plan 21, 63\u201364 (May\n2015).CThese projections were never tested, because\nthe Clean Power Plan never went into effect. The same day that EPA\npromulgated the rule, dozens of parties (including 27 States)\npetitioned for review in the D.\u00a0C. Circuit. After that court\ndeclined to enter a stay of the rule, the challengers sought the\nsame relief from this Court. We granted a stay, preventing the rule\nfrom taking effect.West Virginiav.EPA, 577 U.S.\n1126 (2016). The Court of Appeals later heard argument on the\nmerits en banc. But before it could issue a decision, there was a\nchange in Presidential administrations. The new administration\nrequested that the litigation be held in abeyance so that EPA could\nreconsider the Clean Power Plan. The D.\u00a0C. Circuit obliged,\nand later dismissed the petitions for review as moot.EPA eventually repealed the rule in 2019,\nconcluding that the Clean Power Plan had been \u201cin excess of its\nstatutory authority\u201d under Section 111(d). 84 Fed. Reg. 32523\n(2019). Specifically, the Agency concluded that generation shifting\nshould not have been considered as part of the BSER. The Agency\ninterpreted Section 111 as \u201climit[ing] the BSER to those systems\nthat can be put into operationata building, structure,\nfacility, or installation,\u201d such as \u201cadd-on controls\u201d and\n\u201cinherently lower-emitting processes/practices/designs.\u201dId., at 32524. It then explained that the Clean Power Plan,\nrather than setting the standard \u201cbased on the application of\nequipment and practices at the level of an individual facility,\u201d\nhad instead based it on \u201ca shift in the energy generation mix at\nthe grid level,\u201did., at 32523\u2014not the sort of measure that\nhas \u201ca potential for application to an individual source.\u201dId., at 32524.The Agency determined that \u201cthe interpretative\nquestion raised\u201d by the Clean Power Plan\u2014\u201ci.e., whether a\n\u2018system of emission reduction\u2019 can consist of generation-shifting\nmeasures\u201d\u2014fell under the \u201cmajor question doctrine.\u201dId., at\n32529. Under that doctrine, EPA explained, courts \u201cexpect Congress\nto speak clearly if it wishes to assign to an agency decisions of\nvast economic and political significance.\u201dIbid.(quotingUtility Air Regulatory Groupv.EPA,573 U.S.\n302, 324 (2014) (internal quotation marks omitted)). The Agency\nconcluded that the Clean Power Plan was such a decision, for a\nnumber of reasons. Its \u201cgeneration-shifting scheme was projected to\nhave billions of dollars of impact.\u201d 84 Fed. Reg. 32529. \u201c[N]o\nsection 111 rule of the scores issued ha[d] ever been based on\ngeneration shifting.\u201dIbid.And that novel reading of the\nstatute would empower EPA \u201cto order the wholesale restructuring of\nany industrial sector\u201d based only on its discretionary assessment\nof \u201csuch factors as \u2018cost\u2019 and \u2018feasibility.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIbid.EPA argued that under the major questions\ndoctrine, a clear statement was necessary to conclude that Congress\nintended to delegate authority \u201cof this breadth to regulate a\nfundamental sector of the economy.\u201dIbid.It found none.\n\u201cIndeed,\u201d it concluded, given the text and structure of the\nstatute, \u201cCongress has directly spoken to this precise question and\nprecluded\u201d the use of measures such as generation shifting.Ibid.In the same rulemaking, the Agency replaced the\nClean Power Plan by promulgating a different Section 111(d)\nregulation, known as the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) Rule.Id., at 32532. Based on its view of what measures may\npermissibly make up the BSER, EPA determined that the best system\nwould be akin to building block one of the Clean Power Plan: a\ncombination of equipment upgrades and operating practices that\nwould improve facilities\u2019 heat rates.Id., at 32522, 32537.\nThe ACE Rule determined that the application of its BSER measures\nwould result in only small reductions in carbon dioxide emissions.Id., at 32561.DA number of States and private parties\nimmediately filed petitions for review in the D.\u00a0C. Circuit,\nchallenging EPA\u2019s repeal of the Clean Power Plan and its enactment\nof the replacement ACE Rule. Other States and private\nentities\u2014including petitioners here West Virginia, North Dakota,\nWestmoreland Mining Holdings LLC, and The North American Coal\nCorporation (NACC)\u2014intervened to defend both actions.The Court of Appeals consolidated all 12\npetitions for review into one case. It then held that EPA\u2019s \u201crepeal\nof the Clean Power Plan rested critically on a mistaken reading of\nthe Clean Air Act\u201d\u2014namely, that generation shifting cannot be a\n\u201csystem of emission reduction\u201d under Section 111. 985 F.\u00a03d,\nat 995. To the contrary, the court concluded, the statute could\nreasonably be read to encompass generation shifting. As part of\nthat analysis, the Court of Appeals concluded that the major\nquestions doctrine did not apply, and thus rejected the need for a\nclear statement of congressional intent to delegate such power to\nEPA.Id., at 959\u2013968. Having found that EPA misunderstood\nthe scope of its authority under the Clean Air Act, the Court\nvacated the Agency\u2019s repeal of the Clean Power Plan and remanded to\nthe Agency for further consideration.Id., at 995.It\nalso vacated and remanded the replacement rule, the ACE Rule, for\nthe same reason.Ibid.The court\u2019s decision, handed down on January 19,\n2021, was quickly followed by another change in Presidential\nadministrations. One month later, EPA moved the Court of Appeals to\npartially stay the issuance of its mandate as it pertained to the\nClean Power Plan. The Agency did so to ensure that the Clean Power\nPlan would not immediately go back into effect.

EPA\nbelieved that such a result would not make sense while it was in\nthe process of considering whether to promulgate a new Section\n111(d) rule.Ibid. No party opposed the motion, and the\ncourt accordingly stayed its vacatur of the Agency\u2019s repeal of the\nClean Power Plan.Westmoreland, NACC, and the States defending the\nrepeal of the Clean Power Plan all filed petitions for certiorari.\nWe granted the petitions and consolidated the cases. 595 U.\u00a0S.\n___ (2021).IIWe first consider the Government\u2019s contention\nthat no petitioner has Article III standing to seek our review.Although most disputes over standing concern\nwhether a plaintiff has satisfied the requirement when filing suit,\n\u201cArticle III demands that an actual controversy persist throughout\nall stages of litigation.\u201dHollingsworthv.Perry,570 U.S.\n693, 705 (2013) (internal quotation marks omitted). The\nrequirement of standing \u201cmust be met by persons seeking appellate\nreview, just as it must be met by persons appearing in courts of\nfirst instance.\u201dArizonans for Official Englishv.Arizona,520 U.S.\n43, 64 (1997). In considering a litigant\u2019s standing to appeal,\nthe question is whether it has experienced an injury \u201cfairly\ntraceable to thejudgment below.\u201dFood Marketing\nInstitutev.Argus Leader Media, 588 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___\n(2019) (slip op., at 4) (emphasis added; internal quotation marks\nomitted). If so, and a \u201cfavorable ruling\u201d from the appellate court\n\u201cwould redress [that] injury,\u201d then the appellant has a cognizable\nArticle III stake.Ibid.Here, it is apparent that at least one group of\npetitioners\u2014the state petitioners\u2014are injured by the Court of\nAppeals\u2019 judgment. That judgment vacated \u201cthe ACE ruleandits embedded repeal of the Clean Power Plan,\u201d 985 F.\u00a03d, at\n995 (emphasis added), and accordingly purports to bring the Clean\nPower Plan back into legal effect. Thus, to the extent the Clean\nPower Plan harms the States, the D.\u00a0C. Circuit\u2019s judgment\ninflicts the same injury. And there can be \u201clittle question\u201d that\nthe rule does injure the States, since they are \u201cthe object\nof\u00a0\u201d its requirement that they more stringently regulate power\nplant emissions within their borders.Lujanv.Defenders\nof Wildlife,504 U.S.\n555, 561\u2013562 (1992).The Government counters that \u201cagency and\njudicial actions\u201d subsequent to the court\u2019s entry of judgment have\n\u201celiminated any .\u00a0.\u00a0. possibility\u201d of injury. Brief for\nFederal Respondents 16. First, after the decision, EPA informed the\nCourt of Appeals that it does not intend to enforce the Clean Power\nPlan because it has decided to promulgate a new Section 111(d)\nrule. Second, on EPA\u2019s request, the lower court stayed the part of\nits judgment that vacated the repeal, pending that new rulemaking.\n\u201cThese circumstances,\u201d says the Government, \u201chavemootedthe\nprior dispute as to the CPP Repeal Rule\u2019s legality.\u201dId., at\n17 (emphasis added).That Freudian slip, however, reveals the basic\nflaw in the Government\u2019s argument: It is the doctrine ofmootness, not standing, that addresses whether \u201can\nintervening circumstance [has] deprive[d] the plaintiff of a\npersonal stake in the outcome of the lawsuit.\u201dGenesis\nHealthCare Corp.v.Symczyk,569 U.S.\n66, 72 (2013) (internal quotation marks omitted); see alsoFriends of the Earth,Inc.v.Laidlaw\nEnvironmental Services (TOC),Inc.,528 U.S.\n167, 189\u2013192 (2000). The distinction matters because the\nGovernment, not petitioners, bears the burden to establish that a\nonce-live case has become moot.Id., at 189;Adarand\nConstructors,Inc.v.Slater,528 U.S.\n216, 222 (2000) (per curiam).That burden is \u201cheavy\u201d where, as here, \u201c[t]he\nonly conceivable basis for a finding of mootness in th[e] case is\n[the respondent\u2019s] voluntary conduct.\u201dFriends of the Earth,\n528 U.\u00a0S., at 189. Although the Government briefly argues that\nthe lower court\u2019s stay of its mandate extinguished the controversy,\nit cites no authority for that proposition, and it does not make\nsense: Lower courts frequently stay their mandates when notified\nthat the losing party intends to seek our certiorari review. So the\nGovernment\u2019s mootness argument boils down to its representation\nthat EPA has no intention of enforcing the Clean Power Plan prior\nto promulgating a new Section 111(d) rule.But \u201cvoluntary cessation does not moot a case\u201d\nunless it is \u201cabsolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior\ncould not reasonably be expected to recur.\u201dParents Involved in\nCommunity Schoolsv.Seattle School Dist. No. 1,551 U.S.\n701, 719 (2007). Here the Government \u201cnowhere suggests that if\nthis litigation is resolved in its favor it will not\u201d reimpose\nemissions limits predicated on generation shifting; indeed, it\n\u201cvigorously defends\u201d the legality of such an approach.Ibid.We do not dismiss a case as moot in such circumstances. SeeCity\nof Mesquitev.Aladdin\u2019s Castle,Inc.,455 U.S.\n283, 288\u2013289 (1982). The case thus remains justiciable, and we\nmay turn to the merits.IIIAIn devising emissions limits for power plants,\nEPA first \u201cdetermines\u201d the \u201cbest system of emission reduction\u201d\nthat\u2014taking into account cost, health, and other factors\u2014it finds\n\u201chas been adequately demonstrated.\u201d 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a77411(a)(1). The Agency then quantifies \u201cthe degree of emission\nlimitation achievable\u201d if that best system were applied to the\ncovered source.Ibid.; see also 80 Fed. Reg. 64719. The\nBSER, therefore, \u201cis the central determination that the EPA must\nmake in formulating [its emission] guidelines\u201d under Section 111.Id., at 64723. The issue here is whether restructuring the\nNation\u2019s overall mix of electricity generation, to transition from\n38% coal to 27% coal by 2030, can be the \u201cbest system of emission\nreduction\u201d within the meaning of Section 111.\u201cIt is a fundamental canon of statutory\nconstruction that the words of a statute must be read in their\ncontext and with a view to their place in the overall statutory\nscheme.\u201dDavisv.Michigan Dept. of Treasury,489 U.S.\n803, 809 (1989). Where the statute at issue is one that confers\nauthority upon an administrative agency, that inquiry must be\n\u201cshaped, at least in some measure, by the nature of the question\npresented\u201d\u2014whether Congress in fact meant to confer the power the\nagency has asserted.FDAv.Brown & Williamson\nTobacco Corp.,529 U.S.\n120, 159 (2000).In the ordinary case, that context has\nno great effect on the appropriate analysis. Nonetheless, our\nprecedent teaches that there are \u201cextraordinary cases\u201d that call\nfor a different approach\u2014cases in which the \u201chistory and the\nbreadth of the authority that [the agency] has asserted,\u201d and the\n\u201ceconomic and political significance\u201d of that assertion, provide a\n\u201creason to hesitate before concluding that Congress\u201d meant to\nconfer such authority.Id., at 159\u2013160.Such cases have arisen from all corners of the\nadministrative state. InBrown & Williamson, for\ninstance, the Food and Drug Administration claimed that its\nauthority over \u201cdrugs\u201d and \u201cdevices\u201d included the power to\nregulate, and even ban, tobacco products.Id., at 126\u2013127.\nWe rejected that \u201cexpansive construction of the statute,\u201d\nconcluding that \u201cCongress could not have intended to delegate\u201d such\na sweeping and consequential authority \u201cin so cryptic a fashion.\u201dId., at 160. InAlabama Assn. of Realtorsv.Department of Health and Human Servs., 594 U.\u00a0S. ___,\n___ (2021) (per\u00a0curiam) (slip op., at 3), we concluded\nthat the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention could not,\nunder its authority to adopt measures \u201cnecessary to prevent the\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. spread of\u00a0\u201d disease, institute a nationwide\neviction moratorium in response to the COVID\u201319 pandemic. We found\nthe statute\u2019s language a \u201cwafer-thin reed\u201d on which to rest such a\nmeasure, given \u201cthe sheer scope of the CDC\u2019s claimed authority,\u201d\nits \u201cunprecedented\u201d nature, and the fact that Congress had failed\nto extend the moratorium after previously having done so.Id., at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 6\u20138).Our decision inUtility Airaddressed\nanother question regarding EPA\u2019s authority\u2014namely, whether EPA\ncould construe the term \u201cair pollutant,\u201d in a specific provision of\nthe Clean Air Act, to cover greenhouse gases. 573 U.\u00a0S., at\n310. Despite its textual plausibility, we noted that the Agency\u2019s\ninterpretation would have given it permitting authority over\nmillions of small sources, such as hotels and office buildings,\nthat had never before been subject to such requirements.Id., at 310, 324. We declined to uphold EPA\u2019s claim of\n\u201cunheralded\u201d regulatory power over \u201ca significant portion of the\nAmerican economy.\u201dId., at 324. InGonzalesv.Oregon,546 U.S.\n243(2006), we confronted the Attorney General\u2019s assertion that\nhe could rescind the license of any physician who prescribed a\ncontrolled substance for assisted suicide, even in a State where\nsuch action was legal. The Attorney General argued that this came\nwithin his statutory power to revoke licenses where he found them\n\u201cinconsistent with the public interest,\u201d 21 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7823(f\u00a0). We considered the \u201cidea that Congress gave [him]\nsuch broad and unusual authority through an implicit delegation\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. not sustainable.\u201d 546 U.\u00a0S., at 267. Similar\nconsiderations informed our recent decision invalidating the\nOccupational Safety and Health Administration\u2019s mandate that \u201c84\nmillion Americans .\u00a0.\u00a0. either obtain a COVID\u201319 vaccine\nor undergo weekly medical testing at their own expense.\u201dNational Federation of Independent Businessv.Occupational Safety and Health Administration, 595\nU.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2022) (per\u00a0curiam) (slip op., at\n5).

And yet, in each case, given the various\ncircumstances, \u201ccommon sense as to the manner in which Congress\n[would have been] likely to delegate\u201d such power to the agency at\nissue,Brown & Williamson, 529 U.\u00a0S., at 133, made\nit very unlikely that Congress had actually done so. Extraordinary\ngrants of regulatory authority are rarely accomplished through\n\u201cmodest words,\u201d \u201cvague terms,\u201d or \u201csubtle device[s].\u201dWhitman, 531 U.\u00a0S., at 468.

To convince us\notherwise, something more than a merely plausible textual basis for\nthe agency action is necessary.

But in what the dissent calls the \u201ckey case\u201d in this\narea,Brown & Williamson,post,at 15, the Court\ncould not have been clearer: \u201cIn extraordinary cases . . . there\nmay be reason to hesitate\u201d before accepting a reading of a statute\nthat would, under more \u201cordinary\u201d circumstances, be upheld. 529\nU.\u00a0S., at 159.

Scholars\nand jurists have recognized the common threads between those\ndecisions. So have we. SeeUtility Air, 573 U.\u00a0S., at\n324 (citingBrown & WilliamsonandMCI);Kingv.Burwell, 576 U.S. 473, 486 (2015) (citingUtility Air,Brown & Williamson, andGonzales).BUnder our precedents, this is a major\nquestions case. In arguing that Section 111(d) empowers it to\nsubstantially restructure the American energy market, EPA\n\u201cclaim[ed] to discover in a long-extant statute an unheralded\npower\u201d representing a \u201ctransformative expansion in [its] regulatory\nauthority.\u201dUtility Air, 573 U.\u00a0S., at 324.

And the Agency\u2019s\ndiscovery allowed it to adopt a regulatory program that Congress\nhad conspicuously and repeatedly declined to enact itself.Brown\n& Williamson, 529 U.\u00a0S., at 159\u2013160;Gonzales,\n546 U.\u00a0S., at 267\u2013268;Alabama Assn., 594 U.\u00a0S.,\nat ___, ___ (slip op., at 2, 8). Given these circumstances, there\nis every reason to \u201chesitate before concluding that Congress\u201d meant\nto confer on EPA the authority it claims under Section 111(d).Brown & Williamson, 529 U.\u00a0S., at 159\u2013160.Prior to 2015, EPA had always set emissions\nlimits under Section 111 based on the application of measures that\nwould reduce pollution by causing the regulated source to operate\nmore cleanly. See,e.g., 41 Fed. Reg. 48706 (requiring\n\u201cdegree of control achievable through the application of fiber mist\neliminators\u201d); see alsosupra, at 6. It had never devised a\ncap by looking to a \u201csystem\u201d that would reduce pollution simply by\n\u201cshifting\u201d polluting activity \u201cfrom dirtier to cleaner sources.\u201d 80\nFed. Reg. 64726; seeid., at 64738 (\u201c[O]ur traditional\ninterpretation .\u00a0.\u00a0. has allowed regulated entities to\nproduce as much of a particular good as they desire provided that\nthey do so through an appropriately clean (or low-emitting)\nprocess.\u201d). And as Justice Frankfurter has noted, \u201cjust as\nestablished practice may shed light on the extent of power conveyed\nby general statutory language, so the want of assertion of power by\nthose who presumably would be alert to exercise it, is equally\nsignificant in determining whether such power was actually\nconferred.\u201dFTCv.Bunte Brothers,Inc.,312 U.S.\n349, 352 (1941).The Government quibbles with this description of\nthe history of Section 111(d), pointing to one rule that it says\nrelied upon a cap-and-trade mechanism to reduce emissions. See 70\nFed. Reg. 28616 (2005) (Mercury Rule). The legality of that choice\nwas controversial at the time and was never addressed by a court.\nSeeNew Jerseyv.EPA, 517 F.3d 574 (CADC 2008)\n(vacating on other grounds). Even assuming the Rule was valid,\nthough, it still does not help the Government. In that regulation,\nEPA set the actual \u201cemission cap\u201d\u2014i.e., the limit on\nemissions that sources would be required to meet\u2014\u201cbased on the\nlevel of [mercury] emissions reductions that w[ould] be achievable\nby\u201d the use of \u201ctechnologies [that could be] installed and\noperational on a nationwide basis\u201d in the relevant\ntimeframe\u2014namely, wet scrubbers. 70 Fed. Reg. 28620\u201328621. In other\nwords, EPA set the cap based on the application of particular\ncontrols, and regulated sources could have complied by installing\nthem. By contrast, and by design, there is no control a coal plant\noperator can deploy to attain the emissions limits established by\nthe Clean Power Plan. Seesupra, at 10. The Mercury Rule,\ntherefore, is no precedent for the Clean Power Plan. To the\ncontrary, it was one more entry in an unbroken list of prior\nSection 111 rules that devised the enforceable emissions limit by\ndetermining the best control mechanisms available for the\nsource.[1]This consistent understanding of \u201csystem[s] of\nemission reduction\u201d tracked the seemingly universal view, as stated\nby EPA in its inaugural Section 111(d) rulemaking, that \u201cCongress\nintended a technology-based approach\u201d to regulation in that\nSection. 40 Fed. Reg. 53343 (1975); seeid., at 53341\n(\u201cdegree of control to be reflected in EPA\u2019s emission guidelines\u201d\nwill be based on \u201capplication of best adequately demonstrated\ncontrol technology\u201d).[2] A\ntechnology-based standard, recall, is one that focuses on improving\nthe emissions performance of individual sources. EPA \u201ccommonly\nreferred to\u201d the \u201clevel of control\u201d required as a \u201cbest\ndemonstrated technology (BDT)\u201d standard, 73 Fed. Reg. 34073, and\nconsistently applied it as such.E.g., 61 Fed. Reg. 9907\n(declaring \u201cBDT\u201d to be \u201ca well-designed and well-operated gas\ncollection system and .\u00a0.\u00a0. a control device capable of\nreducing [harmful gases] in the collected gas by 98\nweight-percent.\u201d).Indeed, EPA nodded to this history in the Clean\nPower Plan itself, describing the sort of \u201csystems of emission\nreduction\u201d it had always before selected\u2014\u201cefficiency improvements,\nfuel-switching,\u201d and \u201cadd-on controls\u201d\u2014as \u201cmore traditional air\npollution control measures.\u201d 80 Fed. Reg. 64784. The Agency noted\nthat it had \u201cconsidered\u201d such measures as potential systems of\nemission reduction for carbon dioxide,ibid., including a\nmeasure it ultimately adopted as a \u201ccomponent\u201d of the BSER, namely,\nheat rate improvements.Id., at 64727.But, the Agency explained, in order to\n\u201ccontrol[\u00a0] CO2 from affected [plants] at levels\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. necessary to mitigate the dangers presented by\nclimate change,\u201d it could not base the emissions limit on \u201cmeasures\nthat improve efficiency at the power plants.\u201dId., at 64728.\n\u201cThe quantity of emissions reductions resulting from the\napplication of these measures\u201d would have been \u201ctoo small.\u201dId., at 64727. Instead, to attain the necessary \u201ccritical\nCO2 reductions,\u201d EPA adopted what it called a \u201cbroader,\nforward-thinking approach to the design\u201d of Section 111\nregulations.Id., at 64703. Rather than focus on improving\nthe performance of individual sources, it would \u201cimprove theoverall power systemby lowering the carbon intensity of\npower generation.\u201dIbid.(emphasis added). And it would do\nthat by forcing a shift throughout the power grid from one type of\nenergy source to another. In the words of the then-EPA\nAdministrator, the rule was \u201cnot about pollution control\u201d so much\nas it was \u201can investment opportunity\u201d for States, especially\n\u201cinvestments in renewables and clean energy.\u201d Oversight Hearing on\nEPA\u2019s Proposed Carbon Pollution Standards for Existing Power Plants\nbefore the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, 113th\nCong., 2d Sess., p.\u00a033 (2014).This view of EPA\u2019s authority was not only\nunprecedented; it also effected a \u201cfundamental revision of the\nstatute, changing it from [one sort of] scheme of .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nregulation\u201d into an entirely different kind.MCI, 512\nU.\u00a0S., at 231. Under the Agency\u2019s prior view of Section 111,\nits role was limited to ensuring the efficient pollution\nperformance of each individual regulated source. Under that\nparadigm, if a source was already operating at that level, there\nwas nothing more for EPA to do. Under its newly \u201cdiscover[ed]\u201d\nauthority,Utility Air, 573 U.\u00a0S., at 324, however, EPA\ncan demand much greater reductions in emissions based on a very\ndifferent kind of policy judgment: that it would be \u201cbest\u201d if coal\nmade up a much smaller share of national electricity generation.\nAnd on this view of EPA\u2019s authority, it could go further, perhaps\nforcing coal plants to \u201cshift\u201d away virtually all of their\ngeneration\u2014i.e., to cease making power altogether.[3]The Government attempts to downplay the\nmagnitude of this \u201cunprecedented power over American industry.\u201dIndustrial Union Dept.,AFL\u2013CIOv.American\nPetroleum Institute,448 U.S.\n607, 645 (1980) (plurality opinion). The amount of generation\nshifting ordered, it argues, must be \u201cadequately demonstrated\u201d and\n\u201cbest\u201d in light of the statutory factors of \u201ccost,\u201d \u201cnonair quality\nhealth and environmental impact,\u201d and \u201cenergy requirements.\u201d 42\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a77411(a)(1). EPA therefore must limit the\nmagnitude of generation shift it demands to a level that will not\nbe \u201cexorbitantly costly\u201d or \u201cthreaten the reliability of the grid.\u201d\nBrief for Federal Respondents 42.But this argument does not so muchlimitthe breadth of the Government\u2019s claimed authority asrevealit. On EPA\u2019s view of Section 111(d), Congress implicitly tasked it,\nand it alone, with balancing the many vital considerations of\nnational policy implicated in deciding how Americans will get their\nenergy. EPA decides, for instance, how much of a switch from coal\nto natural gas is practically feasible by 2020, 2025, and 2030\nbefore the grid collapses, and how high energy prices can go as a\nresult before they become unreasonably \u201cexorbitant.\u201dThere is little reason to think Congress\nassigned such decisions to the Agency. For one thing, as EPA itself\nadmitted when requesting special funding, \u201cUnderstand[ing] and\nproject[ing] system-wide .\u00a0.\u00a0. trends in areas such as\nelectricity transmission, distribution, and storage\u201d requires\n\u201ctechnical and policy expertisenottraditionally needed in\nEPA regulatory development.\u201d EPA, Fiscal Year 2016: Justification\nof Appropriation Estimates for the Committee on Appropriations 213\n(2015) (emphasis added). \u201cWhen [an] agency has no comparative\nexpertise\u201d in making certain policy judgments, we have said,\n\u201cCongress presumably would not\u201d task it with doing so.Kisorv.Wilkie, 588 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2019) (slip op., at 17);\nsee alsoGonzales, 546 U.\u00a0S., at 266\u2013267.We also find it \u201chighly unlikely that Congress\nwould leave\u201d to \u201cagency discretion\u201d the decision of how much coal-\nbased generation there should be over the coming decades.MCI, 512 U.\u00a0S., at 231; see alsoBrown &\nWilliamson, 529 U.\u00a0S., at 160 (\u201cWe are confident that\nCongress could not have intended to delegate a decision of such\neconomic and political significance to an agency in so cryptic a\nfashion.\u201d). The basic and consequential tradeoffs involved in such\na choice are ones that Congress would likely have intended for\nitself. See W. Eskridge, Interpreting Law: A Primer on How To Read\nStatutes and the Constitution 288 (2016) (\u201cEven if Congress has\ndelegated an agency general rulemaking or adjudicatory power,\njudges presume that Congress does not delegate its authority to\nsettle or amend major social and economic policy decisions.\u201d).\nCongress certainly has not conferred a like authority upon EPA\nanywhere else in the Clean Air Act. The last place one would expect\nto find it is in the previously little-used backwater of Section\n111(d).The dissent contends that there is nothing\nsurprising about EPA dictating the optimal mix of energy sources\nnationwide, since that sort of mandate will reduce air pollution\nfrom power plants, which is EPA\u2019s bread and butter.Post, at\n20\u201322. But that does not follow. Forbidding evictions may slow the\nspread of disease, but the CDC\u2019s ordering such a measure certainly\n\u201craise[s] an eyebrow.\u201dPost, at 18. We would not expect the\nDepartment of Homeland Security to make trade or foreign policy\neven though doing so could decrease illegal immigration. And no one\nwould consider generation shifting a \u201ctool\u201d in OSHA\u2019s \u201ctoolbox,\u201dpost, at 21, even though reducing generation at coal plants\nwould reduce workplace illness and injury from coal dust.The dissent also cites our decision inAmerican Elec. Power Co.v.Connecticut,564 U.S.\n410(2011).Post, at 20. The question there, however,\nwas whether Congress wanted district court judges to decide, under\nunwritten federal nuisance law, \u201cwhether and how to regulate\ncarbon- dioxide emissions from powerplants.\u201d 564 U.\u00a0S., at\n426. We answered no, given the existence of Section 111(d). But we\nsaid nothing about the ways in which Congress intended EPA to\nexercise its power under that provision. And it is doubtful we had\nin mind that it would claim the authority to require a large shift\nfrom coal to natural gas, wind, and solar. After all, EPA had never\nregulated in that manner, despite having issued many prior rules\ngoverning power plants under Section 111. See,e.g., 71 Fed.\nReg. 9866 (2006); 70 Fed. Reg. 28616; 44 Fed. Reg. 33580; 36 Fed.\nReg. 24875 (1973).[4]Finally, we cannot ignore that the regulatory\nwrit EPA newly uncovered conveniently enabled it to enact a program\nthat, long after the dangers posed by greenhouse gas emissions \u201chad\nbecome well known, Congress considered and rejected\u201d multiple\ntimes.Brown & Williamson, 529 U.\u00a0S., at 144; see\nalsoAlabama Assn., 594 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 2);Bunte Brothers, 312 U.\u00a0S., at 352 (lack of authority\nnot previously exercised \u201creinforced by [agency\u2019s] unsuccessful\nattempt .\u00a0.\u00a0. to secure from Congress an express grant of\n[the challenged] authority\u201d). At bottom, the Clean Power Plan\nessentially adopted a cap-and-trade scheme, or set of state\ncap-and-trade schemes, for carbon. See 80 Fed. Reg. 64734\n(\u201cEmissions trading is .\u00a0.\u00a0. an integral part of our BSER\nanalysis.\u201d). Congress, however, has consistently rejected proposals\nto amend the Clean Air Act to create such a program. See,e.g., American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009,\nH.\u00a0R. 2454, 111th Cong., 1st Sess.; Clean Energy Jobs and\nAmerican Power Act, S. 1733, 111th Cong., 1st Sess. (2009). It has\nalso declined to enact similar measures, such as a carbon tax. See,e.g., Climate Protection Act of 2013, S. 332, 113th Cong.,\n1st Sess.; Save our Climate Act of 2011, H.\u00a0R. 3242, 112th\nCong., 1st Sess. \u201cThe importance of the issue,\u201d along with the fact\nthat the same basic scheme EPA adopted \u201chas been the subject of an\nearnest and profound debate across the country, .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nmakes the oblique form of the claimed delegation all the more\nsuspect.\u201dGonzales, 546 U.\u00a0S., at 267\u2013268 (internal\nquotation marks omitted).CGiven these circumstances, our precedent\ncounsels skepticism toward EPA\u2019s claim that Section 111 empowers it\nto devise carbon emissions caps based on a generation shifting\napproach. To overcome that skepticism, the Government must\u2014under\nthe major questions doctrine\u2014point to \u201cclear congressional\nauthorization\u201d to regulate in that manner.Utility Air, 573\nU.\u00a0S., at 324.All the Government can offer, however, is the\nAgency\u2019s authority to establish emissions caps at a level\nreflecting \u201cthe application of the best system of emission\nreduction .\u00a0.\u00a0. adequately demonstrated.\u201d 42\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a77411(a)(1). As a matter of \u201cdefinitional\npossibilities,\u201dFCCv.AT&T Inc.,562 U.S.\n397, 407 (2011), generation shifting can be described as a\n\u201csystem\u201d\u2014\u201can aggregation or assemblage of objects united by some\nform of regular interaction,\u201d Brief for Federal Respondents\n31\u2014capable of reducing emissions. But of course almost anything\ncould constitute such a \u201csystem\u201d; shorn of all context, the word is\nan empty vessel. Such a vague statutory grant is not close to the\nsort of clear authorization required by our precedents.The Government, echoed by the other respondents,\nlooks to other provisions of the Clean Air Act for support. It\npoints out that the Act elsewhere uses the word \u201csystem\u201d or\n\u201csimilar words\u201d to describe cap-and-trade schemes or other\nsector-wide mechanisms for reducing pollution.Ibid. The\nAcid Rain program set out in Title IV of the Act establishes a\ncap-and-trade scheme for reducing sulfur dioxide emissions, which\nthe statute refers to as an \u201cemission allocation and transfersystem.\u201d \u00a77651(b) (emphasis added). And Section 110 of the\nNAAQS program specifies that \u201cmarketable permits\u201d and \u201cauctions of\nemissions rights\u201d qualify as \u201ccontrol measures, means, or\ntechniques\u201d that States may adopt in their state implementation\nplans in order \u201cto meet the applicable requirements of\u00a0\u201d a\nNAAQS. \u00a77410(a)(2)(A). If the word \u201csystem\u201d or similar words like\n\u201ctechnique\u201d or \u201cmeans\u201d can encompass cap-and-trade, the Government\nmaintains, why not in Section 111?But just because a cap-and-trade \u201csystem\u201d can be\nused to reduce emissions does not mean that it is the kind of\n\u201csystem of emission reduction\u201d referred to in Section 111. Indeed,\nthe Government\u2019s examples demonstrate why it is not.First, unlike Section 111, the Acid Rain and\nNAAQS programs contemplate trading systems as a means ofcomplyingwith analready established emissions\nlimit, set either directly by Congress (as with Acid Rain, see\n42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a77651c) or by reference to the safe\nconcentration of the pollutant in the ambient air (as with the\nNAAQS). In Section 111, by contrast, it is EPA\u2019s job to come up\nwith the cap itself: the \u201cnumerical limit on emissions\u201d that States\nmust apply to each source. 80 Fed. Reg. 64768. We doubt that\nCongress directed the Agency to set an emissions cap at the level\n\u201cwhich reflects the degree of emission limitation achievable\nthrough the application of [a cap-and-trade] system,\u201d \u00a77411(a)(1),\nfor that degree is indeterminate. It is one thing for Congress to\nauthorize regulated sources to use trading to comply with a preset\ncap, or a cap that must be based on some scientific, objective\ncriterion, such as the NAAQS. It is quite another to simply\nauthorize EPA to set the cap itself wherever the Agency sees\nfit.Second, Congress added the above authorizations\nfor the use of emissions trading programs in 1990, simultaneous\nwith amending Section 111 to its present form. At the time,\ncap-and-trade was a novel and highly touted concept. The Acid Rain\nprogram was \u201cthe nation\u2019s first-ever emissions trading program.\u201d L.\nHeinzerling & R. Steinzor, A Perfect Storm: Mercury and the\nBush Administration, 34 Env. L.\u00a0Rep. 10297, 10309 (2004). And\nCongress went out of its way to amend the NAAQS statute to make\nabsolutely clear that the \u201cmeasures, means, [and] techniques\u201d\nStates could use to meet the NAAQS included cap-and-trade.\n\u00a77410(a)(2)(A). Yet \u201cnot a peep was heard from Congress about the\npossibility that a trading regime could be installed under \u00a7111.\u201dId., at 10309.Finally, the Government notes that other parts\nof the Clean Air Act, past and present, have \u201cexplicitly limited\nthe permissible components of a particular \u2018system\u2019 \u201d of emission\nreduction in some regard. Brief for Federal Respondents 32. For\ninstance, a separate section of the statute empowers EPA to require\nthe \u201cdegree of reduction achievable through theretrofitapplication of the best system ofcontinuousemission\nreduction.\u201d \u00a77651f(b)(2) (emphasis added). The comparatively\nunadorned use of the phrase \u201cbest system of emission reduction\u201d in\nSection 111, the Government urges, \u201csuggest[s] a conscious\ncongressional\u201d choicenotto limit the measures that may\nconstitute the BSER to those applicable at or to an individual\nsource.Id., at 32.These arguments, however, concern an\ninterpretive question that is not at issue. We have no occasion to\ndecide whether the statutory phrase \u201csystem of emission reduction\u201d\nrefersexclusivelyto measures that improve the pollution\nperformance of individual sources, such that all other actions are\nineligible to qualify as the BSER. To be sure, it is pertinent to\nour analysis that EPA has acted consistent with such a limitation\nfor the first four decades of the statute\u2019s existence. But the only\ninterpretive question before us, and the only one we answer, is\nmore narrow: whether the \u201cbest system of emission reduction\u201d\nidentified by EPA in the Clean Power Plan was within the authority\ngranted to the Agency in Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act. For\nthe reasons given, the answer is no.[5]*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*Capping carbon dioxide emissions at a level\nthat will force a nationwide transition away from the use of coal\nto generate electricity may be a sensible \u201csolution to the crisis\nof the day.\u201dNew Yorkv.United States,505 U.S.\n144, 187 (1992). But it is not plausible that Congress gave EPA\nthe authority to adopt on its own such a regulatory scheme in\nSection 111(d). A decision of such magnitude and consequence rests\nwith Congress itself, or an agency acting pursuant to a clear\ndelegation from that representative body. The judgment of the Court\nof Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit is reversed, and\nthe cases are remanded for further proceedings consistent with this\nopinion.It is so ordered.Notes1The dissent cites other\nostensible precedents, seepost, at 25\u201326, but they are also\ninapposite. A few allowed cap-and-trade or similar averaging\nmeasures as compliance mechanisms, like the Mercury Rule. See,e.g., 60 Fed. Reg. 65402 (1995). The others were not Section\n111 rules.2See McGarity 165 (EPA\npromulgates \u201ctechnology-based new source performance standards that\nrequire the implementation of the \u2018best available demonstrated\u2019\ntechnology\u201d); P. McCubbin, The Risk in Technology-Based Standards,\n16 Duke Env. L. & Pol\u2019y Forum 1, 46, n.\u00a0180 (2003)\n(Section 111 standards \u201care another set of technology-based\nstandards\u201d); W. Wagner, The Triumph of Technology-Based Standards,\n2000 U. Ill. L.\u00a0Rev 83, 84, n.\u00a04 (\u201cTechnology-based\nstandards made their initial appearance\u201d in \u201cSection 111 of the\nClean Air Act,\u201d which \u201crequires the EPA to set technology-based\nemission limitations\u201d). The dissent points to a 1977 amendment to\nSection 111 as evidence that the 1970 Congress did not intend for\nEPA to establish this sort of source-specific standard.Post, at 10\u201311. But it is clear that the 1977 amendment was\nmerely intended to prohibit power plants from adopting one specific\nkind of at-the-source measure\u2014a switch from burning high-sulfur\ncoal to low-sulfur coal\u2014and was not intended or understood to\nchange the basic, source-focused regulatory approach. SeeWisconsin Elec. Power Co.v.Reilly, 893 F.2d 901,\n919 (CA8 1990) (explaining the history); B. Ackerman & W.\nHassler, Clean Coal/Dirty Air (1981) (same).3The dissent suggests that\nEPA could bring about the same result by, for example, simply\nrequiring coal plants to become natural gas plants, and that this\nwould fit within the prior regulatory approach of\nefficiency-improving, at-the-source measures.Post, at 24.\nOf course, EPA has never ordered anything remotely like that, and\nwe doubt it could. Section 111(d) empowers EPA to guide States in\n\u201cestablish[ing] standards of performance\u201d for \u201cexisting source[s],\u201d\n\u00a77411(d)(1), not to direct existing sources to effectively cease to\nexist.4According to the dissent, \u201cEPA\nis always controlling the mix of energy sources\u201d under Section 111\nbecause all of the Agency\u2019s rules impose some costs on regulated\nplants, and therefore (all else equal) cause those plants to lose\nsome share of the electricity market.Post,at 22. But there\nis an obvious difference between (1) issuing a rule that may end up\ncausing an incidental loss of coal\u2019s market share, and (2) simply\nannouncing what the market share of coal, natural gas, wind, and\nsolar must be, and then requiring plants to reduce operations or\nsubsidize their competitors to get there. No one has ever thought\nthat the Clean Power Plan was just business as usual. SeeAmerican Lung Assn.v.EPA, 985 F.3d 914, 1000 (CADC\n2021) (Walker, J., dissenting) (\u201cLeaders of the environmental\nmovement considered the rule \u2018groundbreaking,\u2019 called its\nannouncement \u2018historic,\u2019 and labeled it a \u2018critically important\ncatalyst.\u2019 \u201d (footnotes omitted)).5We find it odd that the\ndissent accuses us of champing at the bit to \u201cconstrain EPA\u2019s\nefforts to address climate change,\u201dpost, at 4, yet also\nchides us for \u201cmak[ing] no effort\u201d to opine\u2014in what would be plain\ndicta\u2014on \u201chow far [our] opinion constrain[s] EPA,\u201dpost, at\n12.",
