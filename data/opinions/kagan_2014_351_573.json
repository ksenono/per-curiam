UNITED\nSTATESon writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the tenth circuit[June 23, 2014]Justice Kagan\ndelivered the opinion of the Court.A provision of the\nfederal bank fraud statute, 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71344(2),\nmakes criminal a knowing scheme to obtain property owned by, or in\nthe custody of, a bank \u201cby means of false or fraudulent\npretenses, representations, or promises.\u201d The question\npresented is whether the Government must prove that a defendant\ncharged with violating that provision intended to defraud a bank.\nWe hold that the Government need not make that showing.IPetitioner Kevin\nLoughrin executed a scheme to convert altered or forged checks into\ncash. Pretending to be a Mormon missionary going door-to-door in a\nneighborhood in Salt Lake City, he rifled through residential\nmailboxes and stole any checks he found. Sometimes, he washed,\nbleached, ironed, and dried the checks to remove the existing\nwriting, and then filled them out as he wanted; other times, he did\nnothing more than cross out the name of the original payee and add\nanother. And when he was lucky enough to stumble upon a blank\ncheck, he completed it and forged the accountholder\u2019s\nsignature. Over several months, Loughrin made out six of these\nchecks to the retailer Target, for amounts of up to $250. His modus\noperandi was to go to a local store and, posing as the\naccountholder, present an altered check to a cashier to purchase\nmerchandise. After the cashier accepted the check (which,\nremarkably enough, happened time after time), Loughrin would leave\nthe store, then turn around and walk back inside to return the\ngoods for cash.Each of the six checks\nthat Loughrin presented to Target was drawn on an account at a\nfederally insured bank, including Bank of America and Wells Fargo.\nEmployees in Target\u2019s back office identified three of the\nchecks as fraudulent, and so declined to submit them for payment.\nTarget deposited the other three checks. The bank refused payment\non one, after the accountholder notified the bank that she had seen\na man steal her mail. Target appears to have received payment for\nthe other two checks, though the record does not conclusively\nestablish that fact. See Brief for United States 6, 7,\nn.\u00a03.The Federal Government\neventually caught up with Loughrin and charged him with six counts\nof committing bank fraud\u2014one for each of the altered checks\npresented to Target. The federal bank fraud statute, 18\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71344, provides as follows:\u201cWhoever knowingly executes, or attempts\nto execute, a scheme or artifice\u2014(1) to defraud a\nfinancial institution; or(2) to obtain any of\nthe moneys, funds, credits, assets, securities, or other property\nowned by, or under the custody or control of, a financial\ninstitution, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses,\nrepresentations, or promises;shall be fined not more than $1,000,000 or\nimprisoned not more than 30 years, or both.\u201d[1]Ruling (for a reason not material here) that\nCircuit precedent precluded convicting Loughrin under the\nstatute\u2019s first clause, \u00a71344(1), the District Court\nallowed the case to go to the jury on the statute\u2019s second,\n\u00a71344(2).The court instructed\nthe jury that it could convict Loughrin under that clause if, in\noffering the fraudulent checks to Target, he had \u201cknowingly\nexecuted or at-tempted to execute a scheme or artifice to obtain\nmoney or property from the [banks on which the checks were drawn]\nby means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or\npromises.\u201d App. 7. Loughrin asked as well for another\ninstruction: The jury, he argued, must also find that he acted with\n\u201cintent to defraud a financial institution.\u201d App. to\nPet. for Cert. 43a. The court, however, declined to give that\ncharge, and the jury convicted Loughrin on all six counts.The United States Court\nof Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed. See 710 F.\u00a03d 1111\n(2013). As relevant here, it rejected Loughrin\u2019s argument\nthat \u201ca conviction under \u00a71344(2) requires proof that he\nintended to defraud the banks on which the [altered] checks had\nbeen drawn.\u201d Id., at 1115. That intent, the court reasoned,\nis necessary only under the bank fraud law\u2019s first clause.\nThe court acknowledged that under its interpretation, \u00a71344(2)\n\u201ccast[s] a wide net for bank fraud liability,\u201d but\nconcluded that such a result is \u201cdictated by the plain\nlanguage of the statute.\u201d Id., at 1117.We granted certiorari,\n571 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2013), to resolve a Circuit split on whether\n\u00a71344(2) requires the Government to show that a defendant\nintended to defraud a federally insured bank or other financial\ninstitution.[2] We now affirm\nthe Tenth Circuit\u2019s decision.IIWe begin with common\nground. All parties agree, as do we and the Courts of Appeals, that\n\u00a71344(2) requires that a defendant \u201cknowingly execute[\n], or attempt[ ] to execute, a scheme or artifice\u201d with at\nleast two elements. First, the clause requires that the defendant\nintend \u201cto obtain any of the moneys . . . or other property\nowned by, or under the custody or control of, a financial\ninstitution.\u201d (We refer to that element, more briefly, as\nintent \u201cto obtain bank property.\u201d) Brief for United\nStates 11, 17, 20, 22, 32; Brief for Petitioner 30\u201331. And\nsecond, the clause requires that the envisioned result\u2014i.e.,\nthe obtaining of bank property\u2014occur \u201cby means of false\nor fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises.\u201d See\nBrief for United States 21\u201322; Reply Brief 18\u201319.\nLoughrin does not contest the jury instructions on either of those\ntwo elements. Nor does he properly challenge the sufficiency of the\nevidence supporting them here.[3]The single question\npresented is whether the Government must prove yet another element:\nthat the defendant intended to defraud a bank. As Loughrin\ndescribes it, that element would compel the Government to show not\njust that a defendant intended to obtain bank property (as the jury\nhere found), but also that he specifically intended to deceive a\nbank. See Reply Brief 17. And that difference, Loughrin claims,\nwould have mattered in this case, because his intent to deceive ran\nonly to Target, and not to any of the banks on which his altered\nchecks were drawn.But the text of\n\u00a71344(2) precludes Loughrin\u2019s argument. That clause\nfocuses, first, on the scheme\u2019s goal (obtaining bank\nproperty) and, second, on the scheme\u2019s means (a false\nrepresentation). We will later address how the \u201cmeans\u201d\ncomponent of \u00a71344(2) imposes certain inherent limits on its\nreach. See infra, at 11\u201314. But nothing in the clause\nadditionally demands that a defendant have a specific intent to\ndeceive a bank. And indeed, imposing that requirement would prevent\n\u00a71344(2) from applying to a host of cases falling within its\nclear terms. In particular, the clause covers property \u201cowned\nby\u201d the bank but in someone else\u2019s custody and control\n(say, a home that the bank entrusted to a real estate company after\nforeclosure); thus, a person violates \u00a71344(2)\u2019s plain\ntext by deceiving a non-bank custodian into giving up bank property\nthat it holds. Yet under Loughrin\u2019s view, the clause would\nnot apply to such a case except in the (presumably rare)\ncircumstance in which the fraudster\u2019s intent to deceive\nextended beyond the custodian to the bank itself. His proposed\ninquiry would thus function as an extra-textual limit on the\nclause\u2019s compass.And Loughrin\u2019s\nconstruction of \u00a71344(2) becomes yet more untenable in light\nof the rest of the bank fraud statute. That is because the first\nclause of \u00a71344, as all agree, includes the requirement that a\ndefendant intend to \u201cdefraud a financial institution\u201d;\nindeed, that is \u00a71344(1)\u2019s whole sum and substance. See\nBrief for United States 18; Brief for Petitioner 8. To read the\nnext clause, following the word \u201cor,\u201d as somehow\nrepeating that requirement, even while using different words, is to\ndisregard what \u201cor\u201d customarily means. As we have\nrecognized, that term\u2019s \u201cordinary use is almost always\ndisjunctive, that is, the words it connects are to be given\nseparate meanings.\u201d United States v. Woods, 571 U.\u00a0S.\n___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 14). Yet Loughrin would have us\nconstrue the two entirely distinct statutory phrases that the word\n\u201cor\u201d joins as containing an identical element. And in\ndoing so, his interpretation would make \u00a71344\u2019s second\nclause a mere subset of its first: If, that is, \u00a71344(2)\nimplicitly required intent to defraud a bank, it would apply only\nto conduct already falling within \u00a71344(1). Loughrin\u2019s\nconstruction thus effectively reads \u201cor\u201d to mean\n\u201cincluding\u201d\u2014a definition foreign to any\ndictionary we know of.As that account\nsuggests, Loughrin\u2019s view collides as well with more general\ncanons of statutory interpretation. We have often noted that when\n\u201cCongress includes particular language in one section of a\nstatute but omits it in another\u201d\u2014let alone in the very\nnext provision\u2014this Court \u201cpresume[s]\u201d that\nCongress intended a difference in meaning. Russello v. United\nStates, 464 U.\u00a0S. 16, 23 (1983) (citation omitted). And here,\nas just stated, overriding that presumption would render\n\u00a71344\u2019s second clause superfluous. Loughrin\u2019s view\nthus runs afoul of the \u201ccardinal principle\u201d of\ninterpretation that courts \u201cmust give effect, if possible, to\nevery clause and word of a statute.\u201d Williams v. Taylor, 529\nU.\u00a0S. 362, 404 (2000) (citation omitted).[4]IIILoughrin makes two\nprincipal arguments to avoid the import of the statute\u2019s\nplain text. First, he relies on this Court\u2019s construction of\ncomparable language in the federal mail fraud statute to assert\nthat Congress intended \u00a71344(2) merely to explicate the scope\nof \u00a71344(1)\u2019s prohibition on scheming to defraud a bank,\nrather than to cover any additional conduct. And second, he\ncontends that unless we read the second clause in that duplicative\nway, its coverage would extend to a vast range of fraudulent\nschemes, thus intruding on the historic criminal jurisdiction of\nthe States. Neither argument is without force, but in the end,\nneither carries the day.A\u201c[D]espite\nappearances,\u201d Loughrin avers, \u00a71344(2) has no\nindependent meaning: It merely specifies part of what \u00a71344(1)\nalready encompasses. Brief for Petitioner 8. To support that\nconcededly counterintuitive argument, Loughrin invokes our decision\nin McNally v. United States, 483 U.\u00a0S. 350 (1987) ,\ninterpreting similar language in the mail fraud statute, 18\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71341. That law, which served as a model\nfor \u00a71344, see Neder v. United States, 527 U.\u00a0S. 1\n\u201321 (1999), prohibits using the mail to further \u201cany\nscheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining money or property\nby means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or\npromises.\u201d Loughrin rightly explains that, despite the word\n\u201cor,\u201d McNally understood that provision as setting\nforth just one offense\u2014using the mails to advance a scheme to\ndefraud. The provision\u2019s back half, we held, merely codified\na prior judicial decision applying the front half: In other words,\nthe back clarified that the front included certain conduct, rather\nthan doing independent work. 483 U.\u00a0S., at 358\u2013359.\nAccording to Loughrin, we should read the bank fraud statute in the\nsame way.But the two statutes,\nas an initial matter, have notable textual differences. The mail\nfraud law contains two phrases strung together in a single,\nunbroken sentence. By contrast, \u00a71344\u2019s two clauses have\nseparate numbers, line breaks before, between, and after them, and\nequivalent indentation\u2014thus placing the clauses visually on\nan equal footing and indicating that they have separate meanings.\nThe legislative structure thus reinforces the usual (even if not\nMcNally\u2019s) understanding of the word \u201cor\u201d as\nmeaning .\u00a0.\u00a0. well, \u201cor\u201d\u2014rather than,\nas Loughrin would have it, \u201cincluding.\u201dMoreover,\nLoughrin\u2019s reliance on McNally encounters a serious\nchronological problem. Congress passed the bank fraud statute in\n1984, three years before we decided that case. And at that time,\nevery Court of Appeals to have addressed the issue had concluded\nthat the two relevant phrases of the mail fraud law must be read\n\u201cin the disjunctive\u201d and \u201cconstrued\nindependently.\u201d 483 U.\u00a0S., at 358 (citing, e.g., United\nStates v. Clapps, 732 F.\u00a02d 1148, 1152 (CA3 1984); United\nStates v. States, 488 F.\u00a02d 761, 764 (CA8 1973)). McNally\ndisagreed, eschewing the most natural reading of the text in favor\nof evidence it found in the drafting history of the statute\u2019s\nmoney-or-property clause. But the Congress that passed the bank\nfraud statute could hardly have predicted that McNally would\noverturn the lower courts\u2019 uniform reading. We thus see no\nreason to doubt that in enacting \u00a71344, Congress said what it\nmeant and meant what it said, see Connecticut Nat. Bank v. Germain,\n503 U.\u00a0S. 249, 254 (1992) \u2014i.e., that it both said\n\u201cor\u201d and meant \u201cor\u201d in the usual sense.And a peek at history,\nof the kind McNally found decisive, only cuts against\nLoughrin\u2019s reading of the bank fraud statute. According to\nMcNally, Congress added the mail fraud statute\u2019s second,\nmoney-or-property clause merely to affirm a decision of ours\ninterpreting the ban on schemes \u201cto defraud\u201d: The\nsecond clause, McNally reasoned, thus worked no substantive change\nin the law. See 483 U.\u00a0S., at 356\u2013359 (discussing\nCongress\u2019s codification of Durland v. United States, 161\nU.\u00a0S. 306 (1896) ). By contrast, Congress passed the bank\nfraud statute to disapprove prior judicial rulings and thereby\nexpand federal criminal law\u2019s scope\u2014and indeed, partly\nto cover cases like Loughrin\u2019s. One of the decisions\nprompting enactment of the bank fraud law, United States v. Maze,\n414 U.\u00a0S. 395 (1974) , involved a defendant who used a stolen\ncredit card to obtain food and lodging. (Substitute a check for a\ncredit card and Maze becomes Loughrin.) The Government brought\ncharges of mail fraud, relying on post-purchase mailings between\nthe merchants and issuing bank to satisfy the statute\u2019s\nmailing element. But the Court held those mailings insufficiently\nintegral to the fraudulent scheme to support the conviction. See\nid., at 402. Hence, Maze created a \u201cserious gap[ ]\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. in Federal jurisdiction over frauds against\nbanks.\u201d S. Rep. No. 98\u2013225, p. 377 (1983). Congress\npassed \u00a71344 to fill that gap, enabling the Federal Government\nto prosecute fraudsters like Maze and Loughrin. We will not deprive\nthat enactment of its full effect because McNally relied on\ndifferent history to adopt a counter-textual reading of a similar\nprovision.BLoughrin also appeals\nto principles of federalism to support his proffered construction.\nUnless we read \u00a71344(2) as requiring intent to defraud a bank,\nLoughrin contends, the provision will extend to every fraud, no\nmatter how prosaic, happening to involve payment with a\ncheck\u2014even when that check is perfectly valid. Consider, for\nexample, a garden-variety con: A fraudster sells something to a\ncustomer, misrepresenting its value. There are countless\nvariations, but let\u2019s say the fraudster passes off a cheap\nknock-off as a Louis Vuitton handbag. The victim pays for the bag\nwith a good check, which the criminal cashes. Voila!, Loughrin\nsays, bank fraud has just happened\u2014unless we adopt his\nnarrowing construction. After all, the criminal has intended to\n\u201cobtain .\u00a0.\u00a0. property .\u00a0.\u00a0. under the\ncustody or control of\u201d the bank (the money in the\nvictim\u2019s checking account), and has made \u201cfalse or\nfraudulent .\u00a0.\u00a0. representations\u201d (the lies to the\nvictim about the handbag).[5]\nBut if the bank fraud statute were to encompass all such schemes,\nLoughrin continues, it would interfere with matters \u201csquarely\nwithin the traditional criminal jurisdiction of the state\ncourts.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 29. We should avoid such a\n\u201csweeping expansion of federal criminal\u201d law, he\nconcludes, by reading \u00a71344(2), just like \u00a71344(1), as\nrequiring intent to defraud a bank. Reply Brief 3 (quoting\nCleveland v. United States, 531 U.\u00a0S. 12, 24 (2000) ).We agree with this much\nof what Loughrin argues: Unless the text requires us to do so, we\nshould not construe \u00a71344(2) as a plenary ban on fraud,\ncontingent only on use of a check (rather than cash). As we have\noften (and recently) repeated, \u201cwe will not be quick to\nassume that Congress has meant to effect a significant change in\nthe sensitive relation between federal and state criminal\njurisdiction.\u201d Bond v. United States, 572 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___\n(2014) (slip op., at 13) (quoting United States v. Bass, 404\nU.\u00a0S. 336, 349 (1971) ); see Cleveland, 531 U.\u00a0S., at 24\n(\u201cWe resist the Government\u2019s reading .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nbecause it invites us to approve a sweeping expansion of federal\ncriminal jurisdiction in the absence of a clear statement by\nCongress\u201d); Jones v. United States, 529 U.\u00a0S. 848, 858\n(2000) (similar). Just such a rebalancing of criminal jurisdiction\nwould follow from interpreting \u00a71344(2) to cover every\npedestrian swindle happening to involve payment by check, but in no\nother way affecting financial institutions. Indeed, even the\nGovernment expresses some mild discomfort with \u201cfederalizing\nfrauds that are only tangentially related to the banking\nsystem.\u201d Brief for United States 41.But in claiming that we\nmust therefore recognize an invisible element, Loughrin fails to\ntake account of a significant textual limitation on\n\u00a71344(2)\u2019s reach. Under that clause, it is not enough\nthat a fraudster scheme to obtain money from a bank and that he\nmake a false statement. The provision as well includes a relational\ncomponent: The criminal must acquire (or attempt to acquire) bank\nproperty \u201cby means of\u201d the misrepresentation. That\nphrase typically indicates that the given result (the\n\u201cend\u201d) is achieved, at least in part, through the\nspecified action, instrument, or method (the \u201cmeans\u201d),\nsuch that the connection between the two is something more than\noblique, indirect, and incidental. See, e.g., Webster\u2019s Third\nNew International Dictionary 1399 (2002) (defining \u201cby means\nof\u201d as \u201cthrough the instrumentality of: by the use of\nas a means\u201d); 9 Oxford English Dictionary 516 (2d ed. 1989)\n(defining \u201cmeans\u201d as \u201c[a]n instrument, agency,\nmethod, or course of action, by the employment of which some object\nis or may be attained, or which is concerned in bringing about some\nresult\u201d). In other words, not every but-for cause will do.\nIf, to pick an example out of a hat, Jane traded in her car for\nmoney to take a bike trip cross-country, no one would say she\n\u201ccrossed the Rockies by means of a car,\u201d even though\nher sale of the car somehow figured in the trip she took. The\nrelation between those things would be (as the Government puts it)\ntoo \u201ctangential[ ]\u201d to make use of the phrase at all\nappropriate. Brief for United States 41.Section 1344(2)\u2019s\n\u201cby means of\u201d language is satisfied when, as here, the\ndefendant\u2019s false statement is the mechanism naturally\ninducing a bank (or custodian of bank property) to part with money\nin its control. That occurs, most clearly, when a defendant makes a\nmisrepresentation to the bank itself\u2014say, when he attempts to\ncash, at the teller\u2019s window, a forged or altered check. In\nthat event, the defendant seeks to obtain bank property by means of\npresenting the forgery directly to a bank em-ployee. But no less is\nthe counterfeit check the \u201cmeans\u201d of obtaining bank\nfunds when a defendant like Loughrin offers it as payment to a\nthird party like Target.[6]\nAfter all, a merchant accepts a check only to pass it along to a\nbank for payment; and upon receipt from the merchant, that check\ntriggers the disbursement of bank funds just as if presented by the\nfraudster himself. So in either case, the forged or altered\ncheck\u2014i.e., the false statement\u2014serves in the ordinary\ncourse as the means (or to use other words, the mechanism or\ninstrumentality) of obtaining bank property. To be sure, a merchant\nmight detect the fraud (as Target sometimes did) and decline to\nsubmit the forged or altered check to the bank. But that is to say\nonly that the defendant\u2019s scheme to obtain bank property by\nmeans of a false statement may not succeed. And we have long made\nclear that such failure is irrelevant in a bank fraud case, because\n\u00a71344 punishes not \u201ccompleted frauds,\u201d but instead\nfraudulent \u201cscheme[s].\u201d Neder, 527 U.\u00a0S., at\n25.By contrast, the cases\nLoughrin hopes will unnerve us\u2014exemplified by the handbag\nswindle\u2014do not satisfy \u00a71344(2)\u2019s\n\u201cmeans\u201d requirement.[7] Recall that in such a case the check is perfectly\nvalid; so the check itself is not (as it was here) a false or\nfraudulent means of obtaining bank money. And the false pretense\nthat has led, say, the handbag buyer to give a check to the\nfraudster has nothing to do with the bank that will cash it: No one\nwould dream of passing on to the bank (as Target would forward a\nforged check) the lie that a knock-off is a Louis Vuitton. The\nbank\u2019s involvement in the scheme is, indeed, wholly\nfortuitous\u2014a function of the victim\u2019s paying the\nfraudster by (valid) check rather than cash. Of course, the bank\nwould not have disbursed funds had the misrepresentation never\noccurred, and in that sense, the lie counts as a but-for cause of\nthe bank\u2019s payment. But as we have said,\n\u00a71344(2)\u2019s \u201cby means of\u201d language requires\nmore, see supra, at 11\u201312: It demands that the\ndefendant\u2019s false statement is the mechanism naturally\ninducing a bank (or custodian) to part with its money. And in cases\nlike the handbag swindle, where no false statement will ever go to\na financial institution, the fraud is not the means of obtaining\nbank property.[8]The premise of\nLoughrin\u2019s federalism argument thus collapses. He claims that\nwe must import an unstated element into \u00a71344(2) to avoid\ncovering run-of-the-mill frauds, properly of concern only to\nStates. But in fact, the text of \u00a71344(2) already limits its\nscope to deceptions that have some real connection to a federally\ninsured bank, and thus implicate the pertinent federal interest.\nSee S.\u00a0Rep. No. 98\u2013225, at 378 (noting that federal\n\u201cjurisdiction is based on the fact that the victim of the\noffense is a federally controlled or insured institution\u201d).\nAnd Loughrin\u2019s own crime, as we have explained, is one such\nscheme, because he made false statements, in the form of forged and\naltered checks, that a merchant would, in the ordinary course of\nbusiness, forward to a bank for payment. See supra, at 12\u201313.\nWe therefore reject Loughrin\u2019s reading of \u00a71344(2) and\nhis challenge to his conviction.[9]For the reasons stated,\nwe affirm the judgment of the Tenth Circuit.It is so ordered.Notes1A \u201cfinancial\ninstitution,\u201d as defined in , includes a federally insured\nbank of the kind involved here.2Compare 710 F.\u00a03d\n1111, 1116 (CA10 2013) (case below) (\u00a71344(2) does not require\nintent to defraud a bank); v, 270 F.\u00a03d 986, 991 (CA6 2001)\n(same), with v. , 315 F.\u00a03d 190, 197 (CA3 2002) (\u00a71344(2)\nrequires such intent); v. , 221 F. 3d 19, 29 (CA1 2000) (same); v.\n, 117 F.\u00a03d 82, 92\u201393 (CA2 1997) (same).3Loughrin argued to the\njury that the evidence failed to show that he intended to obtain\nbank property: He claimed that once he \u201cobtained cash from\nTarget, .\u00a0.\u00a0. he was indifferent to whether Target ever\nsubmitted the check to a bank or whether a bank ever made payment\non it.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 32; see Tr. 233\u2013235; App.\nto Pet. for Cert. 46a. The jury rejected that contention, as did\nthe District Court on a motion for judgment of acquittal. See\nRecord 168.In his appeal, Loughrin waived the argument by conceding\nthat if the District Court correctly instructed the jury on\n\u00a71344(2)\u2019s elements, \u201cthen there was sufficient\nevidence to convict.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Opening Brief in No.\n11\u20134158 (CA10), p.\u00a034. And although Loughrin\u2019s\nbriefs to this Court attempt to cast doubt on the jury\u2019s\nfinding that he intended to obtain bank property, see Brief for\nPetitioner 30\u201332, that issue is not \u201cfairly\nincluded\u201d in the question his certiorari petition presented,\nSup. Ct. R. 14.1(a).4Loughrin responds that\nour interpretation of the statute creates a converse problem of\nsuperfluity: Clause (2), he says, would emerge so broad as to\nwholly swallow Clause (1). See Reply Brief 7. But that is not\nright. The Courts of Appeals, for example, have unanimously agreed\nthat the Government can prosecute check kiting (,writing checks\nagainst an account with insufficient funds in a way designed to\nkeep them from bouncing) only under Clause (1), because such\nschemes do not involve any false representations. See Tr. of Oral\nArg. 46\u201347; see, v. , 969 F. 2d 425, 427\u2013428 (CA7 1992)\n(citing v, \u2013285 (1982)). No doubt, the overlap between the\ntwo clauses is substantial on our reading, but that is not uncommon\nin criminal statutes. See, ,v, , n.\u00a014 (1995).5One might think the\nFederal Government would never use the bank fraud statute to\nprosecute such ordinary frauds just because they happen to involve\npayment by check rather than cash. But in fact, the Government has\nbrought a number of cases alleging violations of \u00a71344(2) on\nthat theory (so far, it appears, unsuccessfully). See, , 315\nF.\u00a03d 190 (a home health care worker got a valid check from a\npatient to buy groceries, but then cashed the check and pocketed\nthe money); v. , 140 F.\u00a03d 163 (CA2 1998) (an employee filed\nfake invoices with her employer, causing the company to issue valid\nchecks to her friend for services never rendered).6The Government in such a\ncase may, of course, face the separate claim that the defendant did\nnot intend to obtain bank property at all: As noted earlier,\nLoughrin argued this point to the jury, contending (unsuccessfully)\nthat he merely wanted to get cash from Target. See n.\u00a03, . All\nwe say here, for the reasons next stated, is that when the\ndefendant has the requisite intent to acquire bank property, his\npresentation of a forged or altered check to a third party\nsatisfies \u00a71344(2)\u2019s \u201cmeans\u201d\nrequirement.7Even the Government, we\nnote, acknowledges that \u00a71344(2) is reasonably read to exclude\nsuch cases from its coverage. See Brief for United States\n40\u201344; Tr. of Oral Arg. 43\u201347.8takes issue with our\nlimitation of \u00a71344(2), contending first that the\nfraudster\u2019s \u201cindifferen[ce] to the victim\u2019s\nmethod of payment\u201d does not \u201ccause what is a means not\nto be a means.\u201d ,at 2\u20133 (opinion concurring in part and\nconcurring in judgment) (emphasis deleted). To illustrate the\npoint, he offers an example: Someone \u201cobtain[s] 7-Eleven\ncoffee by means of [his] two dollars\u201d even if he went to\n7-Eleven rather than Sheetz only because it happened to be the\nclosest. at 3. But that objection is based on a misunderstanding of\nour opinion. The \u201cby means of\u201d phrase calls for an\ninquiry into the directness of the relationship between means and\nends, not the fraudster\u2019s subjective intent. (We take it\nagrees; he recognizes that \u201cnot every but-for cause of an act\nis a cause \u2018by means of\u2019 which the act has\noccurred.\u201d ,at 2.) And we concur with the bottom line of\nsexample: There, the means (the two dollars) is the thing that\nachieves the specified end (getting the cup of 7-Eleven coffee). By\ncontrast, for the reasons elaborated above, the misstatement in our\nhandbag hypothetical is not the mechanism by which the fraudster\nobtains property, given that the lie will never reach the\nbank.9As a last-gasp argument,\nLoughrin briefly asserts that \u00a71344(2) at least requires the\nGovernment to prove that the defendant\u2019s scheme created a\nrisk of financial loss to the bank. See Brief for Petitioner\n36\u201340. But once again, nothing like that element appears in\nthe clause's text. Indeed, the broad language in \u00a71344(2)\ndescribing the property at issue\u2014\u201cproperty owned by or\nunder the custody or control of\u201d a bank\u2014appears\ncalculated to avoid entangling courts in technical issues of\nbanking law about whether the financial institution or,\nalternatively, a depositor would suffer the loss from a successful\nfraud. See v. , 699 F. 3d 743, 754 (CA2 2012) (Lynch, J.,\nconcurring in part and concurring in judgment in part). And\nLoughrin\u2019s argument fits poorly with our prior holding that\nthe gravamen of \u00a71344 is the \u201cscheme,\u201d rather than\n\u201cthe completed fraud,\u201d and that the offense therefore\ndoes not require \u201cdamage\u201d or \u201creliance.\u201d v.\n, ; see at 13.",
