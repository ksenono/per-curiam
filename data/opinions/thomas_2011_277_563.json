    "text": "OPINION OF THE COURTSOSSAMON V. TEXAS563 U. S. ____ (2011)SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESNO. 08-1438HARVEY LEROY SOSSAMON, III, PETITIONERv.TEXAS et\u00a0al.on writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the fifth circuit[April 20, 2011]Justice Thomas delivered the\nopinion of the Court.This case presents the question\nwhether the States, by accepting federal funds, consent to waive\ntheir sovereign immunity to suits for money damages under the\nReligious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000\n(RLUIPA), 114 Stat. 803, 42 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a72000ccet seq.\nWe hold that they do not. Sovereign immunity therefore bars this\nsuit for damages against the State of Texas.IARLUIPA is Congress\u2019 second\nattempt to accord heightened statutory protection to religious\nexercise in the wake of this Court\u2019s decision inEmployment\nDivision, Department of Human Resources of Oregonv.Smith,494\nU. S. 872(1990). Congress first enacted the Religious Freedom\nRestoration Act of 1993 (RFRA), 107 Stat. 1488, 42 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a72000bbet seq., with which it intended to \u201crestore the\ncompelling interest test as set forth inSherbertv.Verner,374\nU. S. 398(1963) andWisconsinv.Yoder,406 U. S. 205(1972) \u2026 in all cases where free exercise of religion is\nsubstantially burdened.\u201d \u00a72000bb(b)(1). See generallyGonzalesv.O Centro Esp\u00edrita Beneficente\nUni&abreve;o do Vegetal,546 U. S. 418, 424\n(2006). We held RFRA unconstitutional as applied to state and local\ngovernments because it exceeded Congress\u2019 power under \u00a75 of the\nFourteenth Amendment. SeeCity of Boernev.Flores,521\nU. S. 507(1997).Congress responded by enacting\nRLUIPA pursuant to its Spending Clause and Commerce Clause\nauthority. RLUIPA borrows important elements from RFRA\u2014which\ncontinues to apply to the Federal Government\u2014but RLUIPA is less\nsweeping in scope. SeeCutterv.Wilkinson,544 U. S. 709,\n715 (2005). It targets two areas of state and local action:\nland-use regulation, 42 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a72000cc (RLUIPA \u00a72), and\nrestrictions on the religious exercise of institutionalized\npersons, \u00a72000cc\u20131 (RLUIPA \u00a73).Section 3 of RLUIPA provides that \u201c[n]o\ngovernment shall impose a substantial burden on the religious\nexercise\u201d of an institutionalized person unless, as in RFRA, the\ngovernment demonstrates that the burden \u201cis in furtherance of a\ncompelling governmental interest\u201d and \u201cis the least restrictive\nmeans of furthering\u201d that interest. \u00a72000cc\u20131(a); cf.\n\u00a7\u00a72000bb\u20131(a), (b). As relevant here, \u00a73 applies \u201cin any case\u201d in\nwhich \u201cthe substantial burden is imposed in a program or activity\nthat receives Federal financial assistance.\u201d[Footnote 1] \u00a72000cc\u20131(b)(1).RLUIPA also includes an express private cause\nof action that is taken from RFRA: \u201cA person may assert a violation\nof [RLUIPA] as a claim or defense in a judicial proceeding and\nobtain appropriate relief against a government.\u201d \u00a72000cc\u20132(a); cf.\n\u00a72000bb\u20131(c). For purposes of this provision, \u201cgovernment\u201d\nincludes,inter alia, States, counties, municipalities,\ntheir instrumentalities and officers, and persons acting under\ncolor of state law. \u00a72000cc\u20135(4)(A).BPetitioner Harvey Leroy Sossamon\nIII is an inmate in the Robertson Unit of the Texas Department of\nCriminal Justice, Correctional Institutions Division. In 2006,\nSossamon sued the State of Texas and various prison officials in\ntheir official capacities under RLUIPA\u2019s private cause of action,\nseeking injunctive and monetary relief. Sossamon alleged that two\nprison policies violated RLUIPA: (1) a policy preventing inmates\nfrom attending religious services while on cell restriction for\ndisciplinary infractions; and (2) a policy barring use of the\nprison chapel for religious worship. The District Court granted\nsummary judgment in favor of respondents and held, as relevant\nhere, that sovereign immunity barred Sossamon\u2019s claims for monetary\nrelief.[Footnote 2] See 713\nF.\u00a0Supp. 2d 657, 662\u2013663 (WD Tex. 2007).The Court of Appeals for the\nFifth Circuit affirmed. 560 F.\u00a03d 316, 329 (2009).\nAcknowledging that Congress enacted RLUIPA pursuant to the Spending\nClause, the court determined that Texas had not waived its\nsovereign immunity by accepting federal funds. The Court of Appeals\nstrictly construed the text of RLUIPA\u2019s cause of action in favor of\nthe State and concluded that the statutory phrase \u201cappropriate\nrelief against a government\u201d did not \u201cunambiguously notif[y]\u201d Texas\nthat its acceptance of funds was conditioned on a waiver of\nimmunity from claims for money damages.Id., at 330\u2013331.\nWe granted certiorari to resolve a division of authority among the\ncourts of appeals on this question.[Footnote 3] 560 U. S. ___ (2010).II\u201cDual sovereignty is a defining\nfeature of our Nation\u2019s constitutional blueprint.\u201dFederal\nMaritime Comm\u2019nv.South Carolina Ports Authority,535 U. S. 743,\n751 (2002). Upon ratification of the Constitution, the States\nentered the Union \u201cwith their sovereignty intact.\u201dIbid.(internal quotation marks omitted).Immunity from private suits has\nlong been considered \u201ccentral to sovereign dignity.\u201dAldenv.Maine,527 U. S. 706, 715\n(1999). As was widely understood at the time the Constitution was\ndrafted:\u201cIt is inherent in the nature of\nsovereignty not to be amenable to the suit of an individualwithout its consent. This is the general sense, and the\ngeneral practice of mankind; and the exemption, as one of the\nattributes of sovereignty, is now enjoyed by the government of\nevery State in the Union.\u201d The Federalist No. 81, p. 511 (Wright\ned. 1961) (A. Hamilton).Indeed, when this Court threatened state immunity\nfrom private suits early in our Nation\u2019s history, the people\nresponded swiftly to reiterate that fundamental principle. SeeHansv.Louisiana,134 U. S. 1, 11 (1890)\n(discussingChisholmv.Georgia, 2 Dall. 419\n(1793), and the Eleventh Amendment).Sovereign immunity principles enforce an\nimportant constitutional limitation on the power of the federal\ncourts. SeePennhurst State School and Hospitalv.Halderman,465 U. S. 89, 98 (1984).\nFor over a century now, this Court has consistently made clear that\n\u201cfederal jurisdiction over suits against unconsenting States \u2018was\nnot contemplated by the Constitution when establishing the judicial\npower of the United States.\u2019\u00a0\u201dSeminole Tribe of Fla.v.Florida,517 U. S. 44, 54 (1996)\n(quotingHans,supra,at 15); seeSeminole\nTribe,supra, at 54\u201355, n.\u00a07 (collecting cases).\nA State, however, may choose to waive its immunity in federal court\nat its pleasure.Clarkv.Barnard,108 U. S. 436, 447\u2013448\n(1883).Accordingly, \u201cour test for determining whether\na State has waived its immunity from federal-court jurisdiction is\na stringent one.\u201dCollege Savings Bankv.Florida\nPrepaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd.,527 U. S. 666, 675 (1999) (internal\nquotation marks omitted). A State\u2019s consent to suit must be\n\u201cunequivocally expressed\u201d in the text of the relevant statute.Pennhurst State School and Hospital,supra, at\n99; seeAtascadero State Hospitalv.Scanlon,473 U. S. 234,\n238, n.\u00a01, 239\u2013240 (1985). Only by requiring this \u201cclear\ndeclaration\u201d by the State can we be \u201ccertain that the State in fact\nconsents to suit.\u201dCollege Savings Bank, 527 U. S., at\n680. Waiver may not be implied.Id.,at 682.For these reasons, a waiver of sovereign\nimmunity \u201cwill be strictly construed, in terms of its scope, in\nfavor of the sovereign.\u201dLanev.Pe&nacute;a,518 U. S. 187, 192 (1996).[Footnote 4] So, for example, a State\u2019s\nconsent to suit in its own courts is not a waiver of its immunity\nfrom suit in federal court.College Savings Bank,supra, at 676. Similarly, a waiver of sovereign immunity\nto other types of relief does not waive immunity to damages: \u201c[T]he\nwaiver of sovereign immunity must extend unambiguously to such\nmonetary claims.\u201dLane,supra, at 192; cf.United Statesv.Nordic Village,503 U. S. 30, 34 (1992) (construing an\nambiguous waiver of sovereign immunity to permit equitable but not\nmonetary claims);Hoffmanv.Connecticut Dept. of\nIncome Maintenance,492 U. S. 96, 101\u2013102\n(1989) (construing a statute to authorize injunctive relief but not\n\u201cmonetary recovery from the States\u201d because intent to abrogate\nimmunity to monetary recovery was not \u201c\u00a0\u2018unmistakably clear in\nthe language of the statute\u2019\u00a0\u201d (quotingAtascadero,supra, at 242)).IIIARLUIPA\u2019s authorization of\n\u201cappropriate relief against a government,\u201d \u00a72000cc\u20132(a), is not the\nunequivocal expression of state consent that our precedents\nrequire. \u201cAppropriate relief\u00a0\u201d does not so clearly and\nunambiguously waive sovereign immunity to private suits for damages\nthat we can \u201cbe certain that the State in fact consents\u201d to such a\nsuit.College Savings Bank, 527 U. S., at 680.1\u201cAppropriate relief\u00a0\u201d is\nopen-ended and ambiguous about what types of relief it includes, as\nmany lower courts have recognized. See,e.g., 560\nF.\u00a03d, at 330\u2013331.[Footnote\n5] Far from clearly identifying money damages, the word\n\u201cappropriate\u201d is inherently context-dependent. See Webster\u2019s Third\nNew International Dictionary 106 (1993) (defining \u201cappropriate\u201d as\n\u201cspecially suitable: fit, proper\u201d). The context here\u2014where the\ndefendant is a sovereign\u2014suggests, if anything, that monetary\ndamages are not \u201csuitable\u201d or \u201cproper.\u201d SeeFederal Maritime\nComm\u2019n, 535 U. S.,at 765 (\u201c[S]tate sovereign\nimmunity serves the important function of shielding state\ntreasuries \u2026\u201d).Indeed, both the Court and\ndissent appeared to agree inWestv.Gibson,527 U. S. 212(1999), that \u201cappropriate\u201d relief, by itself, does not\nunambiguously include damages against a sovereign. The question was\nwhether the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which has\nauthority to enforce Title VII of the Civil Rights Act against the\nFederal Government \u201cthrough appropriate remedies,\u201d could require\nthe Federal Government to pay damages. 42 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a72000e\u201316(b). The dissent argued that the phrase \u201cappropriate\nremedies\u201d did not authorize damages \u201cin express and unequivocal\nterms.\u201dGibson, 527 U. S., at 226 (opinion of Kennedy,\nJ.). The Court apparently did not disagree but reasoned that\n\u201cappropriate remedies\u201d had a flexible meaning that had expanded to\ninclude money damages after a related statute was amended to\nexplicitly allow damages in actions under Title VII. Seeid., at 217\u2013218.Further, where a statute is susceptible of\nmultiple plausible interpretations, including one preserving\nimmunity, we will not consider a State to have waived its sovereign\nimmunity. SeeDellmuthv.Muth,491 U. S. 223, 232\n(1989) (holding that \u201ca permissible inference\u201d is not the necessary\n\u201cunequivocal declaration\u201d that States were intended to be subject\nto damages actions);Nordic Village, supra, at 37 (holding\nthat the existence of \u201cplausible\u201d interpretations that would not\npermit recovery \u201cis enough to establish that a reading imposing\nmonetary liability on the Government is not \u2018unambiguous\u2019 and\ntherefore should not be adopted\u201d). That is the case here.Sossamon argues that, because RLUIPA expressly\nlimits the United States to \u201cinjunctive or declaratory\nrelief\u00a0\u201d to enforce the statute, the phrase \u201cappropriate\nre-lief\u00a0\u201d in the private cause of action necessarily must be\nbroader. 42 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a72000cc\u20132(f). Texas responds that,\nbecause the State has no immunity defense to a suit brought by the\nFederal Government, Congress needed to exclude damages\naffirmatively in that context but not in the context of private\nsuits. Further, the private cause of action provides that a person\nmay assert a violation of the statute \u201cas a claimor\ndefense.\u201d \u00a72000cc\u20132(a) (emphasis added). Because an injunction\nor declaratory judgment is not \u201cappropriate relief\u00a0\u201d for a\nsuccessful defense, Texas explains, explicitly limiting the private\ncause of action to those forms of relief would make no sense.Sossamon also emphasizes that the statute\nrequires that it be \u201cconstrued in favor of a broad protection of\nreligious exercise.\u201d \u00a72000cc\u20133(g). Texas responds that this\nprovision is best read as addressing the substantive standards in\nthe statute, not the scope of \u201cappropriate relief.\u201d Texas also\nhighlights Congress\u2019 choice of the word \u201crelief,\u201d which it argues\nprimarily connotes equitable relief. See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary\n1295 (7th ed. 1999) (defining \u201crelief\u00a0\u201d as \u201c[t]he redress or\nbenefit, esp. equitable in nature \u2026 , that a party asks of a\ncourt\u201d).These plausible arguments demonstrate that the\nphrase \u201cappropriate relief\u00a0\u201d in RLUIPA is not so free from\nambiguity that we may conclude that the States, by receiving\nfederal funds, have unequivocally expressed intent to waive their\nsovereign immunity to suits for damages. Strictly construing that\nphrase in favor of the sovereign\u2014as we must, seeLane, 518\nU. S., at 192\u2014we conclude that it does not include suits for\ndamages against a State.2The Court\u2019s use of the phrase\n\u201cappropriate relief\u00a0\u201d inFranklinv.Gwinnett\nCounty Public Schools,503 U. S. 60(1992), andBarnesv.Gorman,536 U. S. 181(2002),\ndoes not compel a contrary conclusion. In those cases, the Court\naddressed what remedies are available against municipal entities\nunder theimpliedright of action to enforce Title IX of\nthe Education Amendments of 1972, \u00a7202 of the Americans with\nDisabilities Act of 1990, and \u00a7504 of the Rehabilitation Act of\n1973. With no statutory text to interpret, the Court \u201cpresume[d]\nthe availability of all appropriate remedies unless Congress ha[d]\nexpressly indicated otherwise.\u201dFranklin, 503 U. S., at\n66. The Court described the presumption as \u201c[t]he general rule\u201d\nthat \u201cthe federal courts have the power to award anyappropriate reliefin a cognizable cause of action brought\npursuant to a federal statute.\u201dId., at 70\u201371 (emphasis\nadded); seeBarnes,supra, at 185 (quotingFranklin,supra, at 73). Finding no express\ncongressional intent to limit the remedies available under the\nimplied right of action, the Court held that compensatory damages\nwere available.Franklin,supra, at 73.The presumption inFranklinandBarnesis irrelevant to construing\nthe scope of an express waiver of sovereign immunity. SeeLane,supra, at 196 (\u201c[R]eliance onFranklin\u2026 is misplaced\u201d in determining whether damages\nare available against the Federal Government). The question here is\nnot whether Congress has given clear direction that it intends toexcludea damages remedy, seeFranklin,supra, at 70\u201371, but whether Congress has given clear\ndirection that it intends toincludea damages remedy. The\ntext must \u201cestablish unambiguously that the waiver extends to\nmonetary claims.\u201dNordic Village, 503 U. S., at 34. InFranklinandBarnes, congressional silence had an\nentirely different implication than it does here. Whatever\n\u201cappropriate relief\u00a0\u201d might have meant in those cases does not\ntranslate to this context.[Footnote\n6]BSossamon contends that, because\nCongress enacted \u00a73 of RLUIPA pursuant to the Spending Clause, the\nStates were necessarily on notice that they would be liable for\ndamages. He argues that Spending Clause legislation operates as a\ncontract and damages are always available relief for a breach of\ncontract, whether the contract explicitly includes a damages remedy\nor not. Relying onBarnesandFranklin, he\nasserts that all recipients of federal funding are\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018generally on notice that [they are] subject \u2026 to those\nremedies traditionally available in suits for breach of\ncontract,\u2019\u00a0\u201d including compensatory damages. Brief for\nPetitioner 27 (quotingBarnes, 536 U. S., at 187).We have acknowledged the\ncontract-law analogy, but we have been clear \u201cnot [to] imply \u2026 that\nsuits under Spending Clause legislation are suits in contract, or\nthat contract-law principles apply to all issues that they raise.\u201dBarnes,supra, at 189, n.\u00a02. We have not\nrelied on the Spending Clause contract analogy to expand liability\nbeyond what would exist under non-spending statutes, much less to\nextend monetary liability against the States, as Sossamon would\nhave us do. In fact, inBarnesandFranklin, the\nCourt discussed the Spending Clause context only as a potentiallimitationon liability. SeeBarnes,supra,at 187\u2013188;Franklin,supra, at\n74\u201375.In any event, applying ordinary contract\nprinciples here would make little sense because contracts with a\nsovereign are unique. They do not traditionally confer a right of\naction for damages to enforce compliance: \u201c\u00a0\u2018The contracts\nbetween a Nation and an individual are only binding on the\nconscience of the sovereign and have no pretensions to compulsive\nforce. They confer no right of action independent of the sovereign\nwill.\u2019\u00a0\u201dLynchv.United States,292 U. S. 571, 580\u2013581\n(1934) (quoting The Federalist, No. 81, at 511 (A.\nHamilton)).[Footnote 7]More fundamentally, Sossamon\u2019s\nimplied-contract-remedies proposal cannot be squared with our\nlongstanding rule that a waiver of sovereign immunity must be\nexpressly and unequivocally stated in the text of the relevant\nstatute. It would be bizarre to create an \u201cunequivocal statement\u201d\nrule and then find that every Spending Clause enactment, no matter\nwhat its text, satisfies that rule because it includes unexpressed,\nimplied remedies against the States. The requirement of a clear\nstatement in the text of the statute ensures that Congress has\nspecifically considered state sovereign immunity and has\nintentionally legislated on the matter. Cf.Spectorv.Norwegian Cruise Line Ltd.,545 U. S. 119, 139\n(2005) (plurality opinion) (\u201c[C]lear statement rules ensure\nCongress does not, by broad or general language, legislate on a\nsensitive topic inadvertently or without due deliberation\u201d).\nWithout such a clear statement from Congress and notice to the\nStates, federal courts may not step in and abrogate state sovereign\nimmunity.[Footnote 8]IVSossamon also argues that \u00a71003\nof the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1986, 42 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a72000d\u20137, independently put the State on notice that it could be\nsued for damages under RLUIPA. That provision expressly waives\nstate sovereign immunity for violations of \u201csection 504 of the\nRehabilitation Act of 1973, title IX of the Education Amendments of\n1972, the Age Discrimination Act of 1975, title VI of the Civil\nRights Act of 1964,or the provisions of any other Federal\nstatute prohibiting discrimination by recipients of Federal\nfinancial assistance.\u201d \u00a72000d\u20137(a)(1) (emphasis added).\nSection 1003 makes \u201cremedies (including remedies both at law and in\nequity) \u2026 available for such a violation to the same extent as such\nremedies are available for such a violation in the suit against any\npublic or private entity other than a State.\u201d \u00a72000d\u20137(a)(2).\nSossamon contends that \u00a73 of RLUIPA falls within the residual\nclause of \u00a71003 and therefore \u00a71003 waives Texas\u2019 sovereign\nimmunity to RLUIPA suits for damages.Even assuming that a residual\nclause like the one in \u00a71003 could constitute an unequivocal\ntextual waiver, \u00a73 is not unequivocally a \u201cstatute prohibiting\ndiscrimination\u201d within the meaning of \u00a71003.[Footnote 9] The text of \u00a73 does not prohibit\n\u201cdiscrimination\u201d; rather, it prohibits \u201csubstantial burden[s]\u201d on\nreligious exercise. This distinction is especially conspicuous in\nlight of \u00a72 of RLUIPA, in which Congress expressly prohibited \u201cland\nuse regulation[s] that discriminat[e] \u2026 on the basis of religion.\u201d\n\u00a72000cc(b)(2). A waiver of sovereign immunity must be \u201cstrictly\nconstrued, in terms of its scope, in favor of the sovereign.\u201dLane, 518 U. S., at 192. We cannot say that the residual\nclause clearly extends to \u00a73; a State might reasonably conclude\nthat the clause covers only provisions using the term\n\u201cdiscrimination.\u201dThe statutory provisions specifically listed\nin \u00a71003 confirm that \u00a73 does not unequivocally come within the\nscope of the residual clause. \u201c[G]eneral words,\u201d such as the\nresidual clause here, \u201care construed to embrace only objects\nsimilar in nature to those objects enumerated by the preceding\nspecific words.\u201dWashington State Dept. of Social and Health\nServs.v.Guardianship Estate of Keffeler,537 U. S. 371, 384\n(2003) (internal quotation marks omitted); see alsoJareckiv.G.\u00a0D. Searle & Co.,367 U. S. 303, 307\n(1961) (noting that this maxim \u201cis often wisely applied where a\nword is capable of many meanings in order to avoid the giving of\nunintended breadth to the Acts of Congress\u201d). Unlike \u00a73, each of\nthe statutes specifically enumerated in \u00a71003 explicitly prohibits\n\u201cdiscrimination.\u201d See 29 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7794(a); 20 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a71681(a); 42 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a76101, 6102; 42 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a72000d.[Footnote 10]*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*We conclude that States, in\naccepting federal funding, do not consent to waive their sovereign\nimmunity to private suits for money damages under RLUIPA because no\nstatute expressly and unequivocally includes such a waiver. The\njudgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth\nCircuit is affirmed.It is so ordered.Justice Kagantook no\npart in the consideration or decision of this case.Footnote 1No party contends that the Commerce Clause\npermitted Congress to address the alleged burden on religious\nexercise at issue in this case. See 42 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a72000cc\u20131(b)(2). Nor is Congress\u2019 authority to enact RLUIPA under\nthe Spending Clause challenged here. We therefore do not address\nthose issues.Footnote 2The District Court also denied injunctive\nrelief. 713 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d 657, 668 (WD Tex. 2007). The Court of\nAppeals subsequently held that Sossamon\u2019s claim for injunctive\nrelief with respect to the cell-restriction policy was moot because\nthe State had abandoned that policy after Sossamon filed a prison\ngrievance. 560 F.\u00a03d 316, 326 (CA5 2009). The Court of Appeals\nreversed the District Court with respect to Sossamon\u2019s chapel-use\npolicy claim,id.,at 331\u2013335, although the Robertson Unit\nlater amended that policy also and now permits inmates to attend\nscheduled worship services in the chapel subject to certain safety\nprecautions.Footnote 3CompareMadisonv.Virginia, 474 F.\u00a03d 118, 131 (CA4 2006); 560\nF.\u00a03d, at 331 (case below);Cardinalv.Metrish, 564 F.\u00a03d 794, 801 (CA6 2009);Nelsonv.Miller, 570 F.\u00a03d 868, 885 (CA7\n2009);Van Wyhev.Reisch, 581 F.\u00a03d 639,\n655 (CA8 2009); andHolleyv.California Dept. of\nCorrections, 599 F.\u00a03d 1108, 1112 (CA9 2010), withSmithv.Allen, 502 F.\u00a03d 1255, 1276, n. 12\n(CA11 2007) (citingBenningv.Georgia, 391\nF.\u00a03d 1299, 1305\u20131306 (CA11 2004)).Footnote 4AlthoughLaneconcerned the Federal\nGovernment, the strict construction principle, which flows\nlogically from the requirement that consent be \u201cunequivocally\nexpressed,\u201d applies to the sovereign immunity of the States as\nwell. Cf.United Statesv.Nordic Village, Inc.,503 U. S. 30, 37 (1992) (equating the\n\u201cunequivocal expression\u201d principle from \u201cthe Eleventh Amendment\ncontext\u201d with the principle applicable to federal sovereign\nimmunity);College Savings Bankv.Florida Prepaid\nPostsecondary Ed. Expense Bd.,527 U. S. 666, 682 (1999) (noting the\n\u201cclos[e] analogy\u201d between federal and state sovereign immunity);Belknapv.Schild,161 U. S. 10, 18 (1896)\n(\u201c[A] State \u2026 is as exempt as the United States [is] from private\nsuit\u201d).Footnote 5See alsoHolley,supra, at\n1112;Nelson,supra, at 884;Van Wyhe,supra, at 654;Cardinal,supra, at 801;Madison,supra, at 131\u2013132; cf.Webmanv.Federal Bur. of Prisons, 441 F.\u00a03d 1022, 1023\n(CADC 2006) (interpreting the \u201cappropriate relief\u00a0\u201d provision\nof RFRA).Footnote 6Nor can it be said that this Court\u2019s use of\nthe phrase \u201cappropriate relief\u00a0\u201d inFranklinandBarnessomehow put the States on notice that the same\nphrase in RLUIPA subjected them to suits for monetary relief. Those\ncases did not involve sovereign defendants, so the Court had no\noccasion to consider sovereign immunity. Liability against\nnonsovereigns could not put the States on notice that they would be\nliable in the same manner, absent an unequivocal textual waiver.\nMoreover, the same phrase in RFRA had been interpreted not to\ninclude damages relief against the Federal Government or the States\nand so could have signaled to the States that damages arenot\u201cappropriate relief\u00a0\u201d under RLUIPA. See,e.g.,Tinsleyv.Pittari, 952\nF.\u00a0Supp. 384, 389 (ND Tex. 1996);Commack Self-Service\nKosher Meats Inc.v.New York, 954 F.\u00a0Supp. 65,\n69 (EDNY 1997).Footnote 7Of course, the Federal Government has, by\nstatute, waived its sovereign immunity to damages for breach of\ncontract in certain contexts. See,e.g., 28 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a71491(a)(1).Footnote 8The dissent finds our decision \u201cdifficult to\nunderstand,\u201dpost, at 6 (opinion of Sotomayor, J.), but it\nfollows naturally from this Court\u2019s precedents regarding waiver of\nsovereign immunity, which the dissent gives astonishingly short\nshrift. The dissent instead concerns itself primarily with \u201cgeneral\nremedies principles.\u201dPost, at 1. The essence of sovereign\nimmunity, however, is that remedies against the government differ\nfrom \u201cgeneral remedies principles\u201d applicable to private litigants.\nSee,e.g.,Lanev.Pe&nacute;a,518 U. S. 187, 196 (1996) (calling it\na \u201ccrucial point that, when it comes to an award of money damages,\nsovereign immunity places the \u2026 Government on an entirely different\nfooting than private parties\u201d).Footnote 9Every Court of Appeals to consider the\nquestion has so held. SeeHolley, 599 F.\u00a03d, at\n1113\u20131114;Van Wyhe, 581 F.\u00a03d, at 654\u2013655;Madison, 474 F.\u00a03d, at 132\u2013133.Footnote 10Sossamon argues that \u00a73 resembles \u00a7504 of the\nRehabilitation Act, one of the statutes listed in \u00a71003, because\nboth require special accommodations for particular people or\nactivities. By Sossamon\u2019s reasoning, every Spending Clause statute\nthat arguably provides a benefit to a class of people or activities\nwould become a federal statute \u201cprohibiting discrimination,\u201d\nthereby waiving sovereign immunity. Such an interpretation cannot\nbe squared with the foundational rule that waiver of sovereign\nimmunity must be unequivocally expressed and strictly\nconstrued.",
