S. ____ (2009)SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESNO. 07-8521EDWARD JEROME HARBISON, PETITIONERv.RICKY BELL, WARDENon writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the sixth circuit[April 1, 2009]Justice Thomas, concurring in the\njudgment.I agree that under 28 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a72253(c)(1)(A), a certificate of appealability was not\nrequired to seek appellate review of the issue in this case. Seeante, at 2\u20133; see alsopost, at 1 (Scalia, J.,\nconcurring in part and dissenting in part). I further agree with\nthe Court that 18 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a73599(a)(2) and (e) entitle\neligible state postconviction litigants to federally funded counsel\nin available state clemency proceedings. Seeante, at 2,\n5. As even Justice Scalia acknowledges in his dissenting opinion,\nthe statute \u201ccontains no express language limiting its application\nto proceedings in a federal forum.\u201dPost, at 8; see alsoante, at 1 (Roberts, C.\u00a0J., concurring in judgment)\n(\u201cNothing in the text of \u00a73599(e) excludes proceedings for\navailablestateclemency\u00a0\u2026\u201d). By its express terms,\nthe statute \u201centitle[s]\u201d eligible litigants to appointed counsel\nwho \u201cshall represent the defendant \u2026 in such \u2026 proceedings for\nexecutive or other clemency as may be available to the defendant.\u201d\n\u00a7\u00a73599(a)(2), (e). Because the statute applies to individuals\nchallenging either state or federal convictions, see \u00a73599(a)(2),\nand because state clemency is the only clemency available to those\nchallenging state convictions, \u00a7\u00a73599(a)(2) and (e) necessarily\nentitle eligible state postconviction litigants to federally funded\ncounsel in state clemency proceedings.I disagree, however, with the assumption that\n\u00a73599 must be limited to \u201cfederal\u201d proceedings in at least some\nrespects.Ante, at 6;ante, at 1\u20132 (Roberts,\nC.\u00a0J., concurring in judgment);post, at 3\u20134. The\nmajority and dissent read such a limitation into subsection (a)(1)\nof the statute. But that subsection, like subsection (a)(2),\n\u201ccontains no language limiting its application tofederalcapital defendants. It provides counsel to indigent defendants in\n\u2018everycriminal action in which a defendant is charged\nwith a crime which may be punishable by death.\u2019\u00a0\u201dPost, at 3 (quoting \u00a73599(a)(1)). The majority, then,\ncompounds its error by attempting to discern some distinction\nbetween subsections (a)(1) and (a)(2), to which it properly\ndeclines to add an extratextual \u201cfederal\u201d limitation, seeante, at 5\u20136. The dissent seizes on this inconsistency\nbetween the majority\u2019s interpretation of subsections (a)(1) and\n(a)(2), but responds by incorrectly reading a parallel \u201cfederal\u201d\nlimitation into subsection (a)(2), seepost, at 3\u20134. In\nthe dissent\u2019s view, \u201cit is perfectly reasonable to assume\u201d that\nsubsection (a)(2) is limited to federal postconviction\nproceedings\u2014including clemency proceedings\u2014\u201ceven where the statute\ncontains no such express limitation.\u201dPost,at 3.The Chief Justice, in contrast, finds a\n\u201cfederal\u201d limitation in a clause of subsection (e) that is not\nbefore this Court in order to cabin the reach of today\u2019s decision.\nHe observes that the text of subsection (e) includes no \u201cfederal\u201d\nlimitation with respect to any of the proceedings listed in that\nsubsection. But The Chief Justice finds a way to avoid this\n\u201cproblematic result\u201d by adding a different limitation to \u00a73599. In\nhis view, the \u201cbest\u201d reading of the phrase \u201csubsequent stage[s] of\navailable judicial proceedings\u201d is one that excludes \u201cstate\njudicial proceedings after federal habeas\u201d proceedings because they\nare \u201cnew\u201d\u2014not \u201csubsequent\u201d\u2014judicial proceedings.Ante, at\n2. Without this limitation, The Chief Justice explains, \u201c[he] might\nbe forced to accept the Government\u2019s invitation to insert the word\n\u2018federal\u2019 into \u00a73599(e)\u2014a limitation that would have to apply to\nclemency as well\u201d\u2014because he finds it \u201chighly unlikely\nthat Congress intended\u201d for there to be no federal limitation at\nall in subsection (e).Ante,at 1\u20132.This Court is not tasked with interpreting\n\u00a73599 in a way that it believes is consistent with the policy\noutcome intended by Congress. Nor should this Court\u2019s approach to\nstatutory construction be influenced by the supposition that \u201cit is\nhighly unlikely that Congress intended\u201d a given result. Seeante,at 1 (Roberts, C.\u00a0J., concurring in judgment).\nCongress\u2019 intent is found in the words it has chosen to use. SeeWest Virginia Univ. Hospitals, Inc.v.Casey,499 U. S. 83, 98\n(1991) (\u201cThe best evidence of [Congress\u2019] purpose is the statutory\ntext adopted by both Houses of Congress and submitted to the\nPresident\u201d). This Court\u2019s interpretive function requires it to\nidentify and give effect to the best reading of the words in the\nprovision at issue. Even if the proper interpretation of a statute\nupholds a \u201cvery bad policy,\u201d it \u201cis not within our province to\nsecond-guess\u201d the \u201cwisdom of Congress\u2019 action\u201d by picking and\nchoosing our preferred interpretation from among a range of\npotentially plausible, but likely inaccurate, interpretations of a\nstatute.Eldredv.Ashcroft,537 U. S. 186, 222\n(2003); see alsoTVAv.Hill,437 U. S. 153, 194\n(1978) (\u201cOur individual appraisal of the wisdom or unwisdom of a\nparticular course consciously selected by the Congress is to be put\naside in the process of interpreting a statute\u201d). \u201cOur task is to\napply the text, not to improve upon it.\u201dPavelic &\nLeFlorev.Marvel Entertainment Group, Div. of Cadence\nIndustries Corp.,493 U. S. 120, 126\n(1989).This statute\u2019s silence with respect to a\n\u201cfederal\u201d limitation in no way authorizes us to assume that such a\nlimitation must be read into subsections (a) and (e) in order to\nblunt the slippery-slope policy arguments of those opposed to a\nplain-meaning construction of the provisions under review, seeante, at 8\u20139. And Congress\u2019 silence certainly does not\nempower us to go even farther and incorporate such an assumption\ninto the text of these provisions.Post, at 7\u20138. Moreover,\nthe Court should not decide a question irrelevant to this case in\norder to pre-empt the \u201cproblematic\u201d results that might arise from a\nplain-text reading of the statutory provision under review. Seeante, at 2 (Roberts, C.\u00a0J., concurring in judgment).\nWhether or not The Chief Justice\u2019s construction of the \u201csubsequent\nstage of available judicial proceedings\u201d clause of subsection (e)\nis correct, it is irrelevant to the proper interpretation of the\nclemency clause of subsection (e). Even if the statute were to\nauthorize federal postconviction counsel to appear in state\nproceedings other than state clemency proceedings, a question not\nresolved by today\u2019s decision, that conclusion would not provide a\nlegitimate basis for adopting the dissent\u2019s atextual interpretation\nof the clemency clause of subsection (e). The \u201cbest\u201d interpretation\nof the clemency clause does not turn on the unresolved breadth of\nthe \u201csubsequent stage of available judicial proceedings\u201d\nclause.Rather, the Court must adopt the\ninterpretation of the statute that is most faithful to its text.\nHere, the absence of a \u201cfederal\u201d limitation in the text of\nsubsections (a) and (e) of \u00a73599 most logically suggests that these\nprovisions are not limited to federal clemency proceedings. \u201cIf\nCongress enacted into law something different from what it\nintended, then it should amend the statute to conform it to its\nintent. It is beyond our province to rescue Congress from its\ndrafting errors, and to provide for what we might think is the\npreferred result.\u00a0\u201dLamiev.United States\nTrustee,540 U.\nS. 526, 542 (2004) (internal quotation marks and ellipses\nomitted). Accordingly, I concur in the judgment.",
