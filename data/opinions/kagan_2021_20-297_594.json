Rigorous standing rules help safeguard\nthat separation by keeping the courts away from issues \u201cmore\nappropriately addressed in the representative branches.\u201dId., at 751.In so doing, those rules prevent courts\nfrom overstepping their \u201cproper\u2014and properly limited\u2014role\u201d in \u201ca\ndemocratic society.\u201dWarthv.Seldin,422 U.S.\n490, 498 (1975); seeante, at 7\u20138 (Thomas, J.,\ndissenting).After today\u2019s decision, that story needs a\nrewrite. The Court here transforms standing law from a doctrine of\njudicial modesty into a tool of judicial aggrandizement. It holds,\nfor the first time, that a specific class of plaintiffs whom\nCongress allowed to bring a lawsuit cannot do so under Article III.\nI join Justice Thomas\u2019s dissent, which explains why the majority\u2019s\ndecision is so mistaken. As he recounts, our Article III precedents\nteach that Congress has broad \u201cpower to create and define rights.\u201dAnte, at 13; seeSpokeo,Inc.v.Robins, 578 U.S. 330, 341 (2016);Lujanv.Defenders of Wildlife,504 U.S.\n555, 578 (1992);Warth, 422 U.\u00a0S., at 500. And\nCongress may protect those rights by authorizing suits not only for\npast harms but also for the material risk of future ones. SeeSpokeo, 578 U.\u00a0S., at 341\u2013343;ante, at 15\n(Thomas, J., dissenting). Under those precedents, this case should\nbe easy. In the Fair Credit Reporting Act, Congress determined to\nprotect consumers\u2019 reputations from inaccurate credit reporting.\nTransUnion willfully violated that statute\u2019s provisions by\npreparing credit files that falsely called the plaintiffs potential\nterrorists, and by obscuring that fact when the plaintiffs\nrequested copies of their files. To say, as the majority does, that\nthe resulting injuries did not \u201c\u00a0\u2018exist\u2019 in the real world\u201d is\nto inhabit a world I don\u2019t know.Ante, at 10. And to make\nthat claim in the face of Congress\u2019s contrary judgment is to exceed\nthe judiciary\u2019s \u201cproper\u2014and properly limited\u2014role.\u201dWarth,\n422 U.\u00a0S., at 498; seeante, at 12\u201313 (Thomas, J.,\ndissenting).I add a few words about the majority\u2019s view of\nthe risks of harm to the plaintiffs. In addressing the claim that\nTransUnion failed to maintain accurate credit files, the majority\nargues that the \u201crisk of dissemination\u201d of the plaintiffs\u2019 credit\ninformation to third parties is \u201ctoo speculative.\u201dAnte, at\n22. But why is it so speculative that a company in the business of\nselling credit reports to third parties will in fact sell a credit\nreport to a third party? See alsoante, at 15 (Thomas, J.,\ndissenting) (noting that \u201cnearly 25% of the class\u201d already had\nfalse reports \u201csent to potential creditors\u201d). And in addressing the\nclaims of faulty disclosure to the plaintiffs, the majority makes a\nset of curious assumptions. According to the majority, people who\nspecifically request a copy of their credit report may not even\n\u201copen[\u00a0]\u201d the envelope.Ante, at 25\n(emphasis in original). And people who receive multiple opaque\nmailings are not likely to be \u201cconfused.\u201dIbid.; but seeNiz-Chavezv.Garland, 593 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2021)\n(slip op., at 14) (explaining that a \u201cseries of letters,\u201d \u201ceach\ncontaining a new morsel of vital information,\u201d is likely to perplex\nrecipients). And finally, people who learn that their credit files\nlabel them potential terrorists would not \u201chave tried to correct\u201d\nthe error.Ante, at 25. Rather than accept those\nsuppositions, I sign up with Justice Thomas: \u201c[O]ne need only tap\ninto common sense to know that receiving a letter identifying you\nas a potential drug trafficker or terrorist is harmful.\u201dAnte, at 17.I differ with Justice Thomas on just one matter,\nunlikely to make much difference in practice. In his view, any\n\u201cviolation of an individual right\u201d created by Congress gives rise\nto Article III standing.Ante, at 7. But inSpokeo,\nthis Court held that \u201cArticle III requires a concrete injury even\nin the context of a statutory violation.\u201d 578 U.\u00a0S., at 341. I\ncontinue to adhere to that view, but think it should lead to the\nsame result as Justice Thomas\u2019s approach in all but highly unusual\ncases. AsSpokeorecognized, \u201cCongress is well positioned to\nidentify [both tangible and] intangible harms\u201d meeting Article III\nstandards.Ibid.Article III requires for concreteness only\na \u201creal harm\u201d (that is, a harm that \u201cactually exist[s]\u201d) or a \u201crisk\nof real harm.\u201dIbid.And as today\u2019s decision definitively\nproves, Congress is better suited than courts to determine when\nsomething causes a harm or risk of harm in the real world. For that\nreason, courts should give deference to those congressional\njudgments. Overriding an authorization to sue is appropriate when\nbut only when Congress could not reasonably have thought that a\nsuit will contribute to compensating or preventing the harm at\nissue. Subject to that qualification, I join Justice Thomas\u2019s\ndissent in full.",
