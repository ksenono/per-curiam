W. ORTIZ, PETITIONERv.UNITED\nSTATESon writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the armed forces[June 22, 2018]Justice Kagan delivered the opinion of the\nCourt.This case is about the legality of a military\nofficer serving as a judge on both an Air Force appeals court and\nthe Court of Military Commission Review (CMCR). The petitioner, an\nairman convicted of crimes in the military justice system, contends\nthat the judge\u2019s holding of dual offices violated a statute\nregulating military service, as well as the Constitution\u2019s\nAppointments Clause. The Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces\n(CAAF) rejected those claims, and we granted a petition for\ncertiorari. We hold first that this Court has jurisdiction to\nreview decisions of the CAAF, even though it is not an Article III\ncourt. We then affirm the CAAF\u2019s determination that the judge\u2019s\nsimultaneous service was lawful.IIn the exercise of its authority over the\narmed forces, Congress has long provided for specialized military\ncourts to adjudicate charges against service members. Today,\ntrial-level courts-martial hear cases involving a wide range of\noffenses, including crimes unconnected with military service; as a\nresult, the jurisdiction of those tribunals overlaps substantially\nwith that of state and federal courts. SeeSoloriov.United States, 483 U.\u00a0S. 435, 436 (1987);United\nStatesv.Kebodeaux, 570 U.\u00a0S. 387, 404 (2013)\n(Alito, J., concurring in judgment). And courts-martial are now\nsubject to several tiers of appellate review, thus forming part of\nan integrated \u201ccourt-martial system\u201d that closely resembles\ncivilian structures of justice.United Statesv.Denedo, 556 U.\u00a0S. 904, 920 (2009); seeWeissv.United States, 510 U.\u00a0S. 163, 174 (1994).That system begins with the court-martial\nitself, an officer-led tribunal convened to determine guilt or\ninnocence and levy appropriate punishment, up to lifetime\nimprisonment or execution. See 10 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a7816, 818,\n856a. The next phase of military justice occurs at one of four\nappellate courts: the Court of Criminal Appeals (CCA) for the Army,\nNavy-Marine Corps, Air Force, or Coast Guard. Those courts, using\nthree-judge panels of either officers or civilians, review all\ndecisions in which the sentence imposed involves a punitive\ndischarge, incarceration for more than one year, or death. See\n\u00a7\u00a7866(a)\u2013(c). Atop the court-martial system is the CAAF, a \u201ccourt\nof record\u201d made up of five civilian judges appointed to serve\n15-year terms. \u00a7941; see \u00a7\u00a7942(a)\u2013(b). The CAAF must review certain\nweighty cases (including those in which capital punishment was\nimposed), and may grant petitions for review in any others. See\n\u00a7867. Finally, this Court possesses statutory authority to step in\nafterward: Under 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71259, we have jurisdiction\nto review the CAAF\u2019s decisions by writ of certiorari.Petitioner Keanu Ortiz\u2019s case has run the gamut\nof this legal system. Ortiz, an Airman First Class in the Air\nForce, was charged with knowingly possessing and distributing child\npornography, in violation of the Uniform Code of Military Justice.\nA court-martial found Ortiz guilty as charged and imposed a\nsentence of two years\u2019 imprisonment and a dishonorable discharge.\nOn appeal, an Air Force CCA panel, including Colonel Martin\nMitchell, summarily affirmed the court-martial\u2019s decision. The CAAF\nthen granted Ortiz\u2019s petition for review to consider whether Judge\nMitchell was disqualified from serving on the CCA, thus entitling\nOrtiz to an appellate do-over.That issue arose from Judge Mitchell\u2019s\nsimultaneous service on the CMCR. Congress created the CMCR as an\nappellate tribunal to review the decisions of military commissions,\nparticularly those operating in Guantanamo Bay.[1] The Secretary of Defense put Judge Mitchell on\nthat court shortly after he became a member of the CCA, under a\nstatutory provision authorizing the Secretary to \u201cassign [officers]\nwho are appellate military judges\u201d to serve on the CMCR as well. 10\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7950f(b)(2). Around the same time, a\nmilitary-commission defendant argued to the Court of Appeals for\nthe D.\u00a0C. Circuit that the Appointments Clause requires the\nPresident and Senate (rather than the Secretary) to place judges on\nthe CMCR. The D.\u00a0C. Circuit avoided resolving that issue, but\nsuggested that the President and Senate could \u201cput [it] to rest\u201d by\nappointing the very CMCR judges whom the Secretary had previously\nassigned.In re al-Nashiri, 791 F.3d 71, 86 (2015). The\nPresident decided to take that advice, and nominated each of those\njudges\u2014Mitchell, among them\u2014under an adjacent statutory provision\nauthorizing him to \u201cappoint, by and with the advice and consent of\nthe Senate,\u201d CMCR judges. \u00a7950f(b)(3). The Senate then confirmed\nthose nominations. About a month later, Judge Mitchell\u2014now wearing\nhis CCA robe\u2014participated in the panel decision rejecting Ortiz\u2019s\nappeal.In Ortiz\u2019s view, Judge Mitchell\u2019s appointment to\nthe CMCR barred his continued service on the CCA under both a\nstatute and the Constitution. First, Ortiz invoked 10\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7973(b). That statute, designed to ensure\ncivilian preeminence in government, provides that unless \u201cotherwise\nauthorized by law,\u201d an active-duty military officer like Judge\nMitchell \u201cmay not hold, or exercise the functions of,\u201d certain\n\u201ccivil office[s]\u201d in the Federal Government. \u00a7973(b)(2)(A).\nAccording to Ortiz, a CMCR judgeship is a covered civil office, and\nno other law allowed the President to put Mitchell in that\nposition: Thus, his appointment to the CMCR violated \u00a7973(b). See\nBrief in Support of Petition Granted in No. 16\u20130671 (CAAF),\npp.\u00a017\u201322. And the proper remedy, Ortiz argued, was to\nterminate Judge Mitchell\u2019s military service effective the date of\nhis CMCR appointment and void all his later actions as a CCA\njudge\u2014including his decision on Ortiz\u2019s appeal. Seeibid.Second and independently, Ortiz relied on the Appointments Clause\nto challenge Judge Mitchell\u2019s dual service. Seeid.,at\n27\u201340. The premise of his argument was that CMCR judges are\n\u201cprincipal officers\u201d under that Clause, whereas CCA judges (as this\nCourt has held) are \u201cinferior officers.\u201dEdmondv.United\nStates, 520 U.\u00a0S. 651, 666 (1997). Ortiz claimed that the\nAppointments Clause prohibits someone serving as a principal\nofficer on one court (the CMCR) from sitting alongside inferior\nofficers on another court (the CCA). Because Judge Mitchell had\ndone just that, Ortiz concluded, the CCA\u2019s ruling on his appeal\ncould not stand.The CAAF rejected both grounds for ordering\nanother appeal. See 76 M.J. 189 (2017). In considering the\nstatutory question, the court chose not to decide whether \u00a7973(b)\nprecluded Judge Mitchell from serving on the CMCR while an\nactive-duty officer. Even if so, the CAAF held, the remedy for the\nviolation would not involve terminating the judge\u2019s military\nservice or voiding actions he took on the CCA. Seeid.,at\n192. Turning next to the constitutional issue, the CAAF \u201cs[aw] no\nAppointments Clause problem.\u201dId.,at 193. Even assuming\nJudge Mitchell was a principal officer when sitting on the CMCR,\nthe court held, that status in no way affected his service on the\nCCA: \u201cWhen Colonel Mitchell sits as a CCA judge, he is no different\nfrom any other CCA judge.\u201dIbid.The CAAF thus upheld the\nCCA\u2019s affirmance of Ortiz\u2019s convictions.This Court granted Ortiz\u2019s petition for\ncertiorari to consider whether either \u00a7973(b) or the Appointments\nClause prevents a military officer from serving, as Judge Mitchell\ndid, on both a CCA and the CMCR. 582 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2017). We now\naffirm the decision below.[2]IIWe begin with a question of our own\njurisdiction to review the CAAF\u2019s decisions. Congress has\nexplicitly authorized us to undertake such review in 28\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71259. Seeibid.(\u201cDecisions of the\n[CAAF] may be reviewed by the Supreme Court by writ of\ncertiorari\u201d). Both the Federal Government and Ortiz view that grant\nof jurisdiction as constitutionally proper. But anamicus\ncuriae, Professor Aditya Bamzai, argues that it goes beyond\nwhat Article III allows. That position is a new one to this Court:\nWe have previously reviewed nine CAAF decisions without anyone\nobjecting that we lacked the power to do so.[3] Still, we think the argument is serious, and\ndeserving of sustained consideration. That analysis leads us to\nconclude that the judicial character and constitutional pedigree of\nthe court-martial system enable this Court, in exercising appellate\njurisdiction, to review the decisions of the court sitting at its\napex.Bamzai starts with a proposition no one can\ncontest\u2014that our review of CAAF decisions cannot rest on ouroriginaljurisdiction. Brief for Aditya Bamzai asAmicus\nCuriae11. Article III of the Constitution grants this Court\noriginal jurisdiction in a limited category of cases: those\n\u201caffecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, and\nthose in which a State shall be Party.\u201d \u00a72, cl.\u00a02. That list,\nof course, does not embrace Ortiz\u2019s case, or any other that the\nCAAF considers. And ever sinceMarburyv.Madison, 1\nCranch 137 (1803), this Court has recognized that our original\njurisdiction cannot extend any further than the cases enumerated:\nIf Congress attempts to confer more on us, we must (as Chief\nJustice Marshall famously did, in the pioneer act of judicial\nreview) strike down the law.Id.,at 174\u2013180. As a result,\nBamzai is right to insist that \u00a71259 could not authorize this\nCourt, as part of its original jurisdiction, to hear military cases\nlike Ortiz\u2019s.The real issue is whether ourappellatejurisdiction can cover such cases. Article III\u2019s sole reference to\nappellate jurisdiction provides no apparent barrier, but also no\nsubstantial guidance: Following its specification of this Court\u2019s\noriginal jurisdiction, Article III says only that in all \u201cother\nCases\u201d that the Constitution comprehends (including cases, like\nthis one, involving federal questions), \u201cthe supreme Court shall\nhave appellate Jurisdiction, both as to Law and Fact.\u201d \u00a72,\ncl.\u00a02. The Constitution\u2019s failure to say anything more about\nappellate jurisdiction leads Bamzai to focus on Chief Justice\nMarshall\u2019s opinion inMarbury. See Brief for Bamzai 2\u20134,\n12\u201314. In that case (as you surely recall), William Marbury\npetitioned this Court\u2014without first asking any other\u2014to issue a\nwrit of mandamus to Secretary of State James Madison directing him\nto deliver a commission. After holding (as just related) that the\nCourt\u2019s original jurisdiction did not extend so far, Chief Justice\nMarshall also rejected the idea that the Court could provide the\nwrit in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction. \u201c[T]he\nessential criterion of appellate jurisdiction,\u201d the Chief Justice\nexplained, is \u201cthat it revises and corrects the proceedings in a\ncause already instituted, and does not create that cause.\u201d 1\nCranch, at 175. Marbury\u2019s petition, Chief Justice Marshall held,\ncommenced the cause\u2014or, to use the more modern word, the case;\nhence, it was not a matter for appellate jurisdiction. Bamzai\ncontends that the same is true of Ortiz\u2019s petition.On any ordinary understanding of the great Chief\nJustice\u2019s words, that is a surprising claim. Ortiz\u2019s petition asks\nus to \u201crevise and correct\u201d the latest decision in a \u201ccause\u201d that\nbegan in and progressed through military justice \u201cproceedings.\u201dIbid.Or, as the Government puts the point, this case fits\nwithin Chief Justice Marshall\u2019s standard because \u201cit comes to\nth[is] Court on review of the Court of Appeals for the Armed\nForces\u2019 decision, which reviewed a criminal proceeding that\noriginated in [a] court[\u00a0]-martial.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 47\u201348.\nSo this Court would hardly be the first to render a decision in the\ncase. Unless Chief Justice Marshall\u2019s test implicitly exempts cases\ninstituted in a military court\u2014as contrasted, for example, with an\nordinary federal court\u2014the case is now appellate.[4]The military justice system\u2019s essential\ncharacter\u2014in a word, judicial\u2014provides no reason to make that\ndistinction. Accordpost,at 6\u20138 (Thomas, J., concurring).\nEach level of military court decides criminal \u201ccases\u201d as that term\nis generally understood, and does so in strict accordance with a\nbody of federal law (of course including the Constitution). The\nprocedural protections afforded to a service member are \u201cvirtually\nthe same\u201d as those given in a civilian criminal proceeding, whether\nstate or federal. 1 D. Schlueter, Military Criminal Justice:\nPractice and Procedure \u00a71\u20137, p. 50 (9th ed. 2015) (Schlueter). And\nthe judgments a military tribunal renders, as this Court long ago\nobserved, \u201crest on the same basis, and are surrounded by the same\nconsiderations[, as] give conclusiveness to the judgments of other\nlegal tribunals.\u201dEx parte Reed, 100 U.\u00a0S. 13, 23\n(1879). Accordingly, we have held that the \u201cvalid, final judgments\nof military courts, like those of any court of competent\njurisdiction[,] have res judicata effect and preclude further\nlitigation of the merits.\u201dSchlesingerv.Councilman,\n420 U.\u00a0S. 738, 746 (1975). In particular, those judgments have\nidentical effect under the Double Jeopardy Clause. SeeGraftonv.United States, 206 U.\u00a0S. 333, 345\n(1907).The jurisdiction and structure of the\ncourt-martial system likewise resemble those of other courts whose\ndecisions we review. Although their jurisdiction has waxed and\nwaned over time, courts-martial today can try service members for a\nvast swath of offenses, including garden-variety crimes unrelated\nto military service. See 10 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a7877\u2013934;Solorio, 483 U.\u00a0S., at 438\u2013441;supra,at 1\u20132.\nAs a result, the jurisdiction of those tribunals overlaps\nsignificantly with the criminal jurisdiction of federal and state\ncourts. SeeKebodeaux, 570 U.\u00a0S., at 404 (Alito, J.,\nconcurring in judgment). The sentences meted out are also similar:\nCourts-martial can impose, on top of peculiarly military\ndiscipline, terms of imprisonment and capital punishment. See\n\u00a7818(a);post, at 6 (Thomas, J., concurring) (\u201c[T]hese\ncourts decide questions of the most momentous description,\naffecting even life itself\u201d (quotation marks and ellipses\nomitted)). And the decisions of those tribunals are subject to an\nappellate process\u2014what we have called an \u201cintegrated system of\nmilitary courts and review procedures\u201d\u2014that replicates the judicial\napparatus found in most States.Councilman, 420 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 758. By the time a case like Ortiz\u2019s arrives on our doorstep\nunder 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71259, it has passed through not one or\ntwo but three military courts (including two that can have civilian\njudges).And just as important, the constitutional\nfoundation of courts-martial\u2014as judicial bodies responsible for\n\u201cthe trial and punishment\u201d of service members\u2014is not in the least\ninsecure.Dynesv.Hoover, 20 How. 65, 79 (1858). The\ncourt-martial is in fact \u201colder than the Constitution,\u201d 1 Schlueter\n\u00a71\u20136(B), at 39; the Federalist Papers discuss \u201ctrials by\ncourts-martial\u201d under the Articles of Confederation, see No. 40, p.\n250 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961). When it came time to draft a new\ncharter, the Framers \u201crecogni[zed] and sanction[ed] existing\nmilitary jurisdiction,\u201d W. Winthrop, Military Law and Precedents 48\n(2d ed. 1920) (emphasis deleted), by exempting from the Fifth\nAmendment\u2019s Grand Jury Clause all \u201ccases arising in the land or\nnaval forces.\u201d And by granting legislative power \u201c[t]o make Rules\nfor the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces,\u201d\nthe Framers also authorized Congress to carry forward\ncourts-martial. Art.\u00a0I, \u00a78, cl. 14. Congress did not need to\nbe told twice. The very first Congress continued the court-martial\nsystem as it then operated. See Winthrop,supra,at 47. And\nfrom that day to this one, Congress has maintained courts-martial\nin all their essentials to resolve criminal charges against service\nmembers. See 1 Schlueter \u00a71\u20136, at 35\u201348.Throughout that history, and reflecting the\nattributes described above, courts-martial have operated as\ninstruments of military justice, not (as the dissent would have it)\nmere \u201cmilitary command,\u201dpost,at 18 (opinion of Alito, J.).\nAs one scholar has noted, courts-martial \u201chave long been understood\nto exercise \u2018judicial\u2019 power,\u201d of the same kind wielded by civilian\ncourts. Nelson, Adjudication in the Political Branches, 107 Colum.\nL. Rev. 559, 576 (2007); see W. De Hart, Observations on Military\nLaw 14 (1859) (Military courts are \u201cimbued or endowed with the like\nessence of judicial power\u201d as \u201cordinary courts of civil\njudicature\u201d); accordpost, at 6\u20138 (Thomas, J., concurring).\nAttorney General Bates, even in the middle of the Civil War,\ncharacterized a court-martial \u201cproceeding, from its inception, [a]s\njudicial,\u201d because the \u201ctrial, finding, and sentence are the solemn\nacts of a court organized and conducted under the authority of and\naccording to the prescribed forms of law.\u201dRunklev.United States, 122 U.\u00a0S. 543, 558 (1887) (quoting 11\nOp. Atty. Gen. 19, 21 (1864)). Colonel Winthrop\u2014whom we have called\nthe \u201cBlackstone of Military Law,\u201dReidv.Covert, 354\nU.\u00a0S. 1, 19, n. 38 (1957) (plurality opinion)\u2014agreed with\nBates. He regarded a court-martial as \u201cin the strictest sense\u201d a\n\u201ccourt of law and justice\u201d\u2014\u201cbound, like any court, by the\nfundamental principles of law\u201d and the duty to adjudicate cases\n\u201cwithout partiality, favor, or affection.\u201d Winthrop,supra,at 54.[5]Despite all this, Bamzai claims that\n\u201cMarburybars th[is] Court from deciding\u201d any cases coming\nto us from the court-martial system. Brief for Bamzai 3. He begins,\nmuch as we did above, by explaining that underMarburythe\nCourt can exercise appellate jurisdiction only when it is\n\u201csupervising an earlier decision by a lower court.\u201d Brief for\nBamzai 13. The next step is where the argument gets interesting.\nThe CAAF, Bamzai contends, simply does not qualify as such a body\n(nor does any other military tribunal). True enough, \u201cthe CAAF is\ncalled a \u2018court\u2019\u00a0\u201d; and true enough, it decides cases, just as\nother courts do.Id.,at 3; seeid., at 28. But the\nCAAF, Bamzai notes, is \u201cnot anArticle IIIcourt,\u201did., at 3 (emphasis added): As all agree, its members lack\nthe tenure and salary protections that are the hallmarks of the\nArticle III judiciary, see 10 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a7942(b), (c).\nCongress established the CAAF under its Article I, rather than its\nArticle III, powers, and Congress located the CAAF (as we have\npreviously observed) within the Executive Branch, rather than the\njudicial one. See \u00a7941;Edmond, 520 U.\u00a0S., at 664, and\nn. 2. Those facts, in Bamzai\u2019s view, prevent this Court from\nexercising appellate jurisdiction over the CAAF. \u201cFor\nconstitutional purposes,\u201d Bamzai concludes, the members of the CAAF\n\u201cstand on equal footing with James Madison inMarbury.\u201d\nBrief for Bamzai 4. (With variations here and there, the dissent\nmakes the same basic argument.)But this Court\u2019s appellate jurisdiction, as\nJustice Story made clear ages ago, covers more than the decisions\nof Article III courts. InMartinv.Hunter\u2019s Lessee,\n1 Wheat. 304 (1816), we considered whether our appellate\njurisdiction extends to the proceedings of state courts, in\naddition to those of the Article III federal judiciary. We said\nyes, as long as the case involves subject matter suitable for our\nreview.Id.,at 338\u2013352. For our \u201cappellate power,\u201d Story\nwrote, \u201cis not limited by the terms of [Article III] to any\nparticular courts.\u201dId.,at 338. Or again: \u201c[I]t will be in\nvain to search in the letter of the [C]onstitution for any\nqualification as to the tribunal\u201d from which a given case comes.Ibid.The decisions we review might come from Article III\ncourts, but they need not.The same lesson emerges from two contexts yet\nmore closely resembling this one\u2014each involving a non-Article III\njudicial system created by Congress. First, inUnited Statesv.Coe, 155 U.\u00a0S. 76 (1894), this Court upheld the\nexercise of appellate jurisdiction over decisions of federal\nterritorial courts, despite their lack of Article III status. We\nobserved there that the Constitution grants Congress broad\nauthority over the territories: to \u201cmake all needful Rules and\nRegulations respecting\u201d those areas. Art.\u00a0IV, \u00a73, cl.\u00a02;\nseeCoe, 155 U.\u00a0S., at 85. And we recognized that\nCongress, with this Court\u2019s permission, had long used that power to\ncreate territorial courts that did not comply with Article III. Seeibid.Chief Justice Marshall had held such a court\nconstitutional in 1828 even though its authority was \u201cnot a part of\nthat judicial power which is defined in the 3d article.\u201dAmerican Ins. Co.v.356 Bales of Cotton, 1 Pet. 511,\n546 (1828); seeCoe, 155 U.\u00a0S., at 85 (describing that\nopinion as having \u201csettled\u201d that Article III \u201cdoes not exhaust the\npower of Congress to establish courts\u201d). The exception to Article\nIII for territorial courts was thus an established and prominent\npart of the legal landscape by the timeCoeaddressed this\nCourt\u2019s role in reviewing their decisions. And so the Court found\nthe issue simple. \u201cThere has never been any question,\u201d we declared,\n\u201cthat the judicial action of [territorial courts] may, in\naccordance with the Constitution, be subjected to [our] appellate\njurisdiction.\u201dId.,at 86.Second, we have routinely, and\nuncontroversially, exercised appellate jurisdiction over cases\nadjudicated in the non-Article III District of\u00a0Columbia\ncourts.[6] Here too, the\nConstitution grants Congress an unqualified power: to legislate for\nthe District \u201cin all Cases whatsoever.\u201d Art.\u00a0I, \u00a78, cl. 17.\nUnder that provision, we long ago determined, \u201cCongress has the\nentire control over the [D]istrict for every purpose of\ngovernment,\u201d including that of \u201corganizing a judicial department.\u201dKendallv.United States ex rel. Stokes, 12 Pet. 524,\n619 (1838). So when Congress invoked that authority to create a set\nof local courts, this Court upheld the legislation\u2014even though the\njudges on those courts lacked Article III protections. SeePalmorev.United States, 411 U.\u00a0S. 389, 407\u2013410\n(1973). We relied on the Constitution\u2019s \u201cplenary grant[\u00a0] of\npower to Congress to legislate with respect to\u201d the national\ncapital.Id.,at 408. And several years later, we referred\nas well to the \u201chistorical consensus\u201d supporting congressional\nlatitude over the District\u2019s judiciary.Northern Pipeline\nConstr. Co.v.Marathon Pipe Line Co., 458 U.\u00a0S.\n50, 70 (1982) (plurality opinion); seeid.,at 65,\nn.\u00a016. To be sure, we have never explicitly held, as we did in\nthe territorial context, that those same considerations support our\nappellate jurisdiction over cases resolved in the D.\u00a0C.\ncourts. But some things go unsaid because they are self-evident.\nAnd indeed, even Bamzai readily acknowledges that this Court can\nreview decisions of the D.\u00a0C. Court of Appeals. See Brief for\nBamzai 23, 25.The non-Article III court-martial system stands\non much the same footing as territorial and D.\u00a0C. courts, as\nwe have often noted. The former, just like the latter, rests on an\nexpansive constitutional delegation: As this Court early held,\nArticle I gives Congress the power\u2014\u201centirely independent\u201d of\nArticle III\u2014\u201cto provide for the trial and punishment of military\nand naval offences in the manner then and now practiced by\ncivilized nations.\u201dDynes, 20 How., at 79; seesupra,at 9. The former has, if anything, deeper historical roots,\nstretching from before this nation\u2019s beginnings up to the present.\nSeesupra,at 9. And the former, no less than the others,\nperforms an inherently judicial role, as to substantially similar\ncases. Seesupra,at 8\u201311. So it is not surprising that we\nhave lumped the three together. InPalmore, the Court viewed\nthe military, territories, and District as a triad of \u201cspecialized\nareas having particularized needs\u201d in which Article III \u201cgive[s]\nway to accommodate plenary grants of power to Congress.\u201d 411\nU.\u00a0S., at 408. And inNorthern Pipeline, the plurality\nsaid of all three that \u201ca constitutional grant of power [as]\nhistorically understood\u201d has bestowed \u201cexceptional powers\u201d on\nCongress to create courts outside Article III. 458 U.\u00a0S., at\n66, 70.[7] Given those\nwell-understood connections, we would need a powerful reason to\ndivorce military courts from territorial and D.\u00a0C. courts when\nit comes to defining our appellate jurisdiction.And Bamzai fails to deliver one. His initial\nattempt relies on a simple fact about territorial and D.\u00a0C.\ncourts: They exercise power over \u201cdiscrete geographic areas.\u201d Brief\nfor Bamzai 23. Military courts do not; they instead exercise power\nover discrete individuals\u2014i.e., members of the armed forces.\nSo Bamzai gives us a distinction: places vs. people. What he does\nnot offer is a good reason why that distinction should matter in\nour jurisdictional inquiry\u2014why it is one of substance, rather than\nconvenience. He mentions that the territorial and D.\u00a0C. courts\nare \u201cfunctional equivalents of state courts.\u201dId.,at 24;\nsee Tr. of Oral Arg. 33, 35. But for starters, that could be said\nof courts-martial too. As we have described, they try all the\n\u201cordinary criminal offenses\u201d (murder, assault, robbery, drug\ncrimes, etc., etc., etc.) that state courts do.Kebo- deaux,\n570 U.\u00a0S., at 404 (Alito, J., concurring in judgment); seesupra,at 1\u20132, 9. And more fundamentally, we do not see why\ngeographicalstate-likeness, rather than historicalcourt-likeness, should dispose of the issue. As we have\nshown, the petition here asks us to \u201crevise[\u00a0] and\ncorrect[\u00a0] the proceedings in a cause already instituted\u201d in a\njudicial system recognized since the founding as competent to\nrender the most serious decisions.Marbury, 1 Cranch, at\n175; seesupra,at 8\u201311. That should make the case an\nappeal, whether or not the domain that system covers is precisely\nanalogous to, say, Alabama.So Bamzai tries another route to cleave off\nmilitary courts, this time focusing on their location in the\nExecutive Branch. See Brief for Bamzai 26\u201330. Bamzai actually never\nsays in what branch (if any) he thinks territorial and D.\u00a0C.\ncourts reside. But he knows\u2014because this Court has said\u2014that the\nCAAF is an \u201cExecutive Branch entity.\u201dEdmond, 520\nU.\u00a0S., at 664, and n.\u00a02; seesupra,at 12. And in\nBamzai\u2019s view, two of our precedents show that we may never accept\nappellate jurisdiction from any person or body within that branch.\nSee Brief for Bamzai 2\u20134. The first case he cites isEx parte\nVallandigham, 1 Wall. 243 (1864), in which the Court held that\nit lacked jurisdiction over decisions of a temporary Civil War-era\nmilitary commission. Seeid., at 251\u2013252. The second isMarburyitself, in which the Court held (as if this needed\nrepeating) that it lacked jurisdiction to review James Madison\u2019s\nrefusal to deliver a commission appointing William Marbury a\njustice of the peace. See 1 Cranch, at 175\u2013176;supra,at\n7.As to the first,Vallandighamgoes to\nshow only that not every military tribunal is alike. The commission\nthe Court considered there was established by General Ambrose\nBurnside (he of the notorious facial hair) for a time-limited,\nspecialized purpose\u2014to try persons within the military Department\nof Ohio (Burnside\u2019s then-command) for aiding the Confederacy. See 1\nWall., at 243\u2013244. And the General kept firm control of the\ncommission (made up entirely of his own field officers): After\npersonally ordering Vallandigham\u2019s arrest, he (and he alone) also\nreviewed the commission\u2019s findings and sentence. Seeid.,at\n247\u2013248; J. McPherson, Battle Cry of Freedom 596\u2013597 (1988). This\nCourt therefore found that the commission lacked \u201cjudicial\ncharacter.\u201d 1 Wall., at 253. It was more an adjunct to a general\nthan a real court\u2014and so we did not have appellate jurisdiction\nover its decisions.[8] But the\nvery thing that Burnside\u2019s commission lacked, the court-martial\nsystem\u2014and, in particular, the CAAF (whose decision Ortiz asks us\nto review)\u2014possesses in spades. Once again, the CAAF is a permanent\n\u201ccourt of record\u201d created by Congress; it stands at the acme of a\nfirmly entrenched judicial system that exercises broad jurisdiction\nin accordance with established rules and procedures; and its own\ndecisions are final (except if we review and reverse them). Seesupra,at 1\u20132, 8\u201311.[9]\nThat is \u201cjudicial character\u201d more than sufficient to separate the\nCAAF from Burnside\u2019s commission, and align it instead with\nterritorial and D.\u00a0C. (and also state and federal) courts of\nappeals.And the differences between the CAAF\u2019s decisions\nand James Madison\u2019s delivery refusal should have already leaped off\nthe page. To state the obvious: James Madison was not a court,\neither in name or in function. He was the Secretary of State\u2014the\nhead of a cabinet department (and, by the way, the right arm of the\nPresident). Likewise, Madison\u2019s failure to transmit Marbury\u2019s\ncommission was not a judicial decision; it was an enforcement\naction (though in the form of non-action), pertaining only to the\nexecution of law. As Chief Justice Marshall saw, Secretary Madison\nmerely triggered the case ofMarburyv.Madison; he\ndid not hear and resolve it, as a judicial body would have done.\nSee 1 Cranch, at 175. The Chief Justice\u2019s opinion thus cleanly\ndivides that case from this one, even if both (as Bamzai notes)\nformally involve executive officers. Here, three constitutionally\nrooted courts, ending with the CAAF, rendered inherently judicial\ndecisions\u2014just as such tribunals have done since our nation\u2019s\nfounding. In reviewing, \u201crevis[ing,] and correct[ing]\u201d those\nproceedings, as Ortiz asks, we do nothing more or different than in\ngenerally exercising our appellate jurisdiction.Ibid.But finally, in holding that much, we say\nnothing about whether we could exercise appellate jurisdiction over\ncases from other adjudicative bodies in the Executive Branch,\nincluding those in administrative agencies. Our resolution of the\njurisdictional issue here has rested on the judicial character, as\nwell as the constitutional foundations and history, of the\ncourt-martial system. We have relied, too, on the connections that\nour cases have long drawn between that judicial system and those of\nthe territories and the District. If Congress were to grant us\nappellate jurisdiction over decisions of newer entities advancing\nan administrative (rather than judicial) mission, the question\nwould be different\u2014and the answer not found in this opinion.IIIWe may now turn to the issues we took this\ncase to decide. Recall that Ortiz seeks a new appeal proceeding\nbefore the Air Force CCA, based on Judge Mitchell\u2019s participation\nin his last one. Seesupra,at 2\u20134. Ortiz\u2019s challenge turns\non Judge Mitchell\u2019s simultaneous service on another court, the\nCMCR. Originally, the Secretary of Defense had assigned Judge\nMitchell to sit on that court. Then, to moot a possible\nconstitutional problem with Judge Mitchell\u2019s CMCR service, the\nPresident (with the Senate\u2019s advice and consent) appointed Judge\nMitchell as well. A short time later, Judge Mitchell ruled on\nOrtiz\u2019s CCA appeal. Ortiz contends that doing so violated both a\nfederal statute and the Appointments Clause. We dis- agree on both\ncounts.AThe statutory issue respecting Judge\nMitchell\u2019s dual service turns on two interlocking provisions. The\nfirst is \u00a7973(b)(2)(A)\u2014the statute Ortiz claims was violated here.\nAs noted earlier, that law\u2014in the interest of ensuring civilian\npreeminence in government\u2014prohibits active-duty military officers\nlike Judge Mitchell from \u201chold[ing], or exercis[ing] the functions\nof,\u201d certain \u201ccivil office[s]\u201d in the Federal Government, \u201c[e]xcept\nas otherwise authorized by law.\u201d Seesupra,at 4. The second\nis \u00a7950f(b)\u2014a statute the Government claims \u201cotherwise\nauthorize[s]\u201d Judge Mitchell\u2019s service on the CMCR, even if a seat\non that court is a covered \u201ccivil office.\u201d As also noted above,\n\u00a7950f(b) provides two ways to become a CMCR judge. Seesupra, at 3. Under \u00a7950f(b)(2), the Secretary of Defense\n\u201cmay assign\u201d qualified officers serving on a CCA to \u201cbe judges on\nthe [CMCR]\u201d as well. And under \u00a7950f(b)(3), the President (with the\nSenate\u2019s advice and consent) \u201cmay appoint\u201d persons\u2014whether officers\nor civilians is unspecified\u2014to CMCR judgeships.Against that statutory backdrop, Ortiz claims\nthat Judge Mitchell became disqualified from serving on the CCA the\nmoment his presidential appointment to the CMCR became final. See\nBrief for Petitioners 39\u201342. Notably, Ortiz has no statutory\nobjection to Judge Mitchell\u2019s simultaneous service on those courts\nbefore that date\u2014when he sat on the CMCR solely by virtue of the\nSecretary of Defense\u2019s assignment. Seeid.,at 40. Nor could\nhe reasonably lodge such a complaint, for \u00a7950f(b)(2), in no\nuncertain terms, \u201cotherwise authorize[s]\u201d the Secretary to place a\nmilitary judge on the CMCR\u2014thus exempting such an officer from\n\u00a7973(b)(2)(A)\u2019s prohibition. But in Ortiz\u2019s view, the provision in\n\u00a7950f(b)(3) for presidential appointments contains no similar\nauthorization, because it makes no \u201cexpress[\u00a0] or\nunambiguous[\u00a0]\u201d reference to military officers.Id., at\n20. And so, Ortiz concludes, \u00a7973(b)(2)(A)\u2019s general rule must\ngovern.In the circumstances here, however, the\nauthorization in \u00a7950f(b)(2) was the only thing necessary to exempt\nJudge Mitchell from the civil office-holding ban\u2014not just before\nbut also after his presidential appointment. That provision, as\njust noted, unambiguously permitted the Secretary of Defense to\nplace Judge Mitchell on the CMCR, even if such a judgeship is a\n\u201ccivil office.\u201d Seesupra,at 20. And once that happened,\nthe President\u2019s later appointment of Judge Mitchell made not a whit\nof difference. Nothing in \u00a7950f (or any other law) suggests that\nthe President\u2019s appointment erased or otherwise negated the\nSecretary\u2019s earlier action. To the contrary, that appointment (made\nfor purposes of protecting against a constitutional challenge, seesupra,at 3) merely ratified what the Secretary had already\ndone. The nomination papers that the President submitted to the\nSenate reflect that fact. They sought confirmation of Judge\nMitchell\u2019s appointment as a CMCR judge \u201c[i]n accordance with [his]\ncontinued status as [a CMCR] judge pursuant to [his] assignment by\nthe Secretary of Defense[,] under 10 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. Section\n950f(b)(2).\u201d 162 Cong. Rec. S1474 (Mar. 14, 2016). So after the\nSenate approved the nomination, Judge Mitchell served on the CMCR\nby virtue ofboththe Secretary\u2019s assignment and the\nPresident\u2019s appointment. And because \u00a7950f(b)(2) expressly\nauthorized the Secretary\u2019s assignment, Judge Mitchell\u2019s service on\nthe CMCR could not run afoul of \u00a7973(b)(2)(A)\u2019s general\nrule.[10]Ortiz argues in response that the President\u2019s\nappointment demanded its own clear authorization because only that\nappointment put Judge Mitchell into a \u201cnew office.\u201d Reply Brief 7.\nAccording to Ortiz, an officer who receives a secretarial\nassignment to the CMCR \u201cexercise[s] additional duties\u201d\u2014but he does\nnot hold a second position. Tr. of Oral Arg. 13. A presidential\nappointment alone, he says, effects that more dramatic change. And\nOrtiz contends that \u00a7973(b)(2)(A)\u2019s rule cares about that\ndifference. That law, Ortiz says, requires a legislative\nauthorization when, and only when, a service member receives a\nwhole new office\u2014which is to say here when, and only when, the\nPresident appoints a judge to the CMCR. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 4\u20135\n(stating that \u00a7973(b)(2)(A) \u201cprohibit[s] military officers from\nholding [civil offices] absent express con- gressional\nauthorization, while generally allowing mili- tary officers to be\nassigned to exercise the duties of such positions\u201d).But that argument is contrary to \u00a7973(b)(2)(A)\u2019s\ntext, as well as to the purposes it reflects. The statute draws no\ndistinction between secretarial assignees and presidential\nappointees, nor between those who exercise the duties of an office\nand those who formally hold it. True enough, we have sometimes\nreferred to \u00a7973(b)(2)(A) as a rule about dual \u201coffice-holding,\u201d\nseesupra,at 21, 22, n. 10\u2014but that is mere shorthand. In\nfact, \u00a7973(b)(2)(A)\u2019s prohibition applies broadly, and uniformly,\nto any military officer who \u201chold[s], or exercise[s] the functions\nof,\u201d a covered civil office. And the \u201cexcept as otherwise\nauthorized\u201d caveat applies in the same way\u2014to \u201chold[ing]\u201d and\n\u201cexercis[ing]\u201d alike. So the very distinction that Ortiz relies on,\nthe statute rejects: Indeed, the law could not be clearer in its\nindifference. That is because Congress determined that military\nofficers threaten civilian preeminence in government byeither\u201chold[ing]\u201dor\u201cexercis[ing] the functions of\u201d\nimportant civil offices. Except .\u00a0.\u00a0. if Congress decides\notherwise and says as much.And once again, here Congress did exactly that.\nJudge Mitchell became a CMCR judge, while remaining in the\nmilitary, because of a secretarial assignment that Congress\nexplicitly authorized. Seesupra,at 20\u201321. After his\npresidential appointment, he continued on the same court, doing the\nsame work, in keeping with the same congressional approval. Even\nsupposing he obtained a \u201cnew office\u201d in the way Ortiz says, that\nacquisition is of no moment. With or without that formal office,\nJudge Mitchell \u201ch[e]ld, or exercise[d] the functions of,\u201d a CMCR\njudgeship, and so was subject to \u00a7973(b)(2)(A)\u2019s ban. But likewise,\nwith or without that formal office, Judge Mitchell could receive\npermission from Congress to do the job\u2014that is, to sit as a judge\non the CMCR. And \u00a7950f(b)(2) gave Judge Mitchell that legislative\ngreen light, from the date of his assignment through his ruling on\nOrtiz\u2019s case and beyond.BFinally, Ortiz raises an Appointments Clause\nchallenge to Judge Mitchell\u2019s simultaneous service on the CCA and\nthe CMCR. That Clause provides that the President \u201cshall nominate,\nand by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall\nappoint\u201d the \u201cOfficers of the United States,\u201d but that \u201cCongress\nmay by Law vest the Appointment of such inferior Officers, as they\nthink proper, in the President alone, in the Courts of Law, or in\nthe Heads of Departments.\u201d Art.\u00a0II, \u00a72, cl.\u00a02. Litigants\nusually invoke the Appointments Clause when they object to how a\ngovernment official is placed in his office. A litigant may assert,\nfor example, that because someone is a principal rather than an\ninferior officer, he must be nominated by the President and\nconfirmed by the Senate. (Recall that just such an argument about\nCMCR judges led to Judge Mitchell\u2019s presidential appointment. Seesupra,at 3.) But Ortiz\u2019s argument is not of that genre. He\ndoes not claim that the process used to make Judge Mitchell either\na CCA judge or a CMCR judge violated the Appointments Clause.\nInstead, he claims to find in that Clause a principle relating to\ndual service. A CCA judge, Ortiz notes, is an inferior officer. SeeEdmond, 520 U.\u00a0S., at 666. But a CMCR judge, he says\n(though the Government has argued otherwise), is a principal\nofficer. And in Ortiz\u2019s view, a single judge cannot, consistent\nwith the Appointments Clause, serve as an inferior officer on one\ncourt and a principal officer on another. He calls such dual\noffice-holding \u201cincongru[ous]\u201d and \u201cfunctionally incompatible.\u201d\nBrief for Petitioners 50. The problem, he suggests, is that the\nother (inferior officer) judges on the CCA will be \u201cunduly\ninfluenced by\u201d Judge Mitchell\u2019s principal-officer status on the\nCMCR.Id.,at 51.But that argument stretches too far. This Court\nhas never read the Appointments Clause to impose rules about dual\nservice, separate and distinct from methods of appointment. Nor has\nit ever recognized principles of \u201cincongruity\u201d or \u201cincompatibility\u201d\nto test the permissibility of holding two offices. As Ortiz himself\nacknowledges, he can \u201ccite no authority holding that the\nAppointments Clause prohibits this sort of simultaneous service.\u201dId., at 52.And if we were ever to apply the Clause to dual\noffice-holding, we would not start here. Ortiz tells no plausible\nstory about how Judge Mitchell\u2019s service on the CMCR would result\nin \u201cundue influence\u201d on his CCA colleagues. The CMCR does not\nreview the CCA\u2019s decisions (or vice versa); indeed, the two courts\ndo not have any overlapping jurisdiction. They are parts of\nseparate judicial systems, adjudicating different kinds of charges\nagainst different kinds of defendants. Seesupra,at 1\u20133,\nand n. 1. We cannot imagine that anyone on the CCA acceded to Judge\nMitchell\u2019s views because he also sat on the CMCR\u2014any more than we\ncan imagine a judge on an Article III Court of Appeals yielding to\na colleague because she did double duty on the Foreign Intelligence\nSurveillance Court of Review (another specialized court). The CAAF\nput the point well: \u201cWhen Colonel Mitchell sits as a CCA judge, he\nis no different from any other CCA judge.\u201d 76 M.\u00a0J., at 193;\nseesupra,at 5. So there is no violation of the\nAppointments Clause.IVThis Court has appellate jurisdiction to\nreview the CAAF\u2019s decisions. In exercising that jurisdiction, we\nhold that Judge Mitchell\u2019s simultaneous service on the CCA and the\nCMCR violated neither \u00a7973(b)(2)(A)\u2019s office-holding ban nor the\nConstitution\u2019s Appointments Clause. We therefore affirm the\njudgment below.It is so ordered.Notes1In contrast to\ncourts-martial, military commissions have historically been used to\nsubstitute for civilian courts in times of martial law or temporary\nmilitary government, as well as to try members of enemy forces for\nviolations of the laws of war. SeeHamdanv.Rumsfeld, 548 U.\u00a0S. 557, 595\u2013597 (2006) (plurality\nopinion).2At the same time we\nissued a writ of certiorari in this case, we granted and\nconsolidated petitions in two related cases\u2014Dalmazziv.United States, No. 16\u2013961, andCoxv.United\nStates, No. 16\u20131017. Those cases raise issues of statutory\njurisdiction that our disposition today makes it unnecessary to\nresolve. We accordingly dismissDalmazzi,post, p.\n___, andCox,post, p. ___,as improvidently\ngranted in opinions accompanying this decision.3SeeUnited Statesv.Denedo, 556 U.\u00a0S. 904 (2009);Clintonv.Goldsmith, 526 U.\u00a0S. 529 (1999);United Statesv.Scheffer, 523 U.\u00a0S. 303 (1998);Edmondv.United States, 520 U.\u00a0S. 651 (1997);Lovingv.United States, 517 U.\u00a0S. 748 (1996);Ryderv.United States, 515 U.\u00a0S. 177 (1995);Davisv.United States, 512 U.\u00a0S. 452 (1994);Weissv.United States, 510 U.\u00a0S. 163 (1994);Soloriov.United States, 483 U.\u00a0S. 435 (1987).4The dissent asserts that, in\nsetting out that test, we have \u201cbasically proceed[ed] as thoughMarburywere our last word on the subject\u201d and overlooked\n\u201ctwo centuries of precedent.\u201dPost, at 8 (opinion of Alito,\nJ.). But the cases the dissent faults us for failing to cite stand\nfor the same principle that we\u2014and more important,Marbury\u2014already set out. They too say that our appellate\njurisdiction permits us to review only prior judicial decisions,\nrendered by courts. See,e.g.,Ex parte Yerger, 8\nWall. 85, 97 (1869) (Our \u201cappellate jurisdiction\u201d may \u201cbe exercised\nonly in the revision of judicial decisions\u201d);The Alicia, 7\nWall. 571, 573 (1869) (\u201c[A]n appellate jurisdiction necessarily\nimplies some judicial determination . . . of an inferior tribunal,\nfrom which an appeal has been taken\u201d);Cohensv.Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 396 (1821) (In exercising appellate\njurisdiction, we act as a \u201csupervising Court, whose peculiar\nprovince it is to correct the errors of an inferior Court\u201d);Ex\nparte Bollman, 4 Cranch 75, 101 (1807) (We exercise \u201cappellate\njurisdiction\u201d in \u201crevisi[ng] a decision of an inferior court\u201d);post, at 4\u20136, 10, 12.Marbury, then, remains the key\nprecedent.5The independent adjudicative\nnature of courts-martial is not inconsistent with their\ndisciplinary function, as the dissent claims, seepost, at\n18\u201326. By adjudicating criminal charges against service members,\ncourts-martial of course help to keep troops in line. But the way\nthey do so\u2014in comparison to, say, a commander in the field\u2014is\nfundamentally judicial. Accordpost, at 9 (Thomas, J.,\nconcurring) (\u201cWhile the CAAF is in the Executive Branch and its\npurpose is to help the President maintain troop discipline, those\nfacts do not change thenatureof the power that it\nexercises\u201d). Colonel Winthrop stated as much: Even while\ncourts-martial \u201cenforc[e] discipline\u201d in the armed forces, they\nremain \u201cas fully a court of law and justice as is any civil\ntribunal.\u201d W. Winthrop, Military Law and Precedents 49, 54 (2d ed.\n1920). And he was right. When a military judge convicts a service\nmember and imposes punishment\u2014up to execution\u2014he is not meting out\nextra-judicial discipline. He is actingas a judge, in\nstrict compliance with legal rules and principles\u2014rather than as an\n\u201carm of military command.\u201dPost, at 18. It is in fact one of\nthe glories of this country that the military justice system is so\ndeeply rooted in the rule of law. In asserting the opposite\u2014that\nmilitary courts are not \u201cjudicial\u201d in \u201ccharacter\u201d\u2014the dissent\ncannot help but do what it says it would like to avoid: \u201cdenigrat[e\nthe court-martial] system.\u201dPost, at 27; seepost, at\n25.6See,e.g.,Artisv.District of Columbia, 583 U.\u00a0S. ___\n(2018);Turnerv.United States, 582 U.\u00a0S. ___\n(2017);United Statesv.Dixon, 509 U.\u00a0S. 688\n(1993);Jonesv.United States, 463 U.\u00a0S. 354\n(1983);Tutenv.United States, 460 U.\u00a0S. 660\n(1983);Whalenv.United States, 445 U.\u00a0S. 684\n(1980);United Statesv.Crews, 445 U.\u00a0S. 463\n(1980);Pernellv.Southall Realty, 416 U.\u00a0S.\n363 (1974);Palmorev.United States, 411 U.\u00a0S.\n389 (1973). In none of these or similar cases has anyone ever\nchallenged our appellate jurisdiction.7In addition, several\nJustices in separate opinions have made the same linkage. See,e.g.,Wellness Int\u2019l Network, Ltd.v.Sharif,\n575 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2015) (Roberts, C.\u00a0J., dissenting)\n(slip op., at 3) (noting that \u201cnarrow exceptions permit Congress to\nestablish non-Article III courts to exercise general jurisdiction\nin the territories and the District of Columbia [and] to serve as\nmilitary tribunals\u201d);id.,at ___\u2013___ (Thomas, J.,\ndissenting) (slip op., at 7\u20138) (referring to territorial courts and\ncourts-martial as \u201cunique historical exceptions\u201d to Article III);Sternv.Marshall, 564 U.\u00a0S. 462, 504\u2013505 (2011)\n(Scalia, J., concurring) (noting the \u201cfirmly established historical\npractice\u201d of exempting territorial courts and courts-martial from\nArticle III\u2019s demands). The dissent must dismiss all this\nauthority, from Justices both functionalist and formalist, to aver\nthat \u201cit isonlywhen Congress legislates for the\nTerritories and the District that it may lawfully vest judicial\npower in tribunals that do not conform to Article III.\u201dPost, at 16; seepost, at 14\u201316. Not so, we have made\nclear, because (once again) of an exceptional grant of power to\nCongress, an entrenched historical practice, and (for some more\nfunctionalist judges) particularized needs. The result is \u201cthat\nCongress has the power [apart from Article III] to provide for the\nadjudication of disputes among the Armed Forces,\u201d just as in the\nterritories and the District.Wellness,575 U.\u00a0S., at\n___ (Thomas, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 8).8The dissent offers a\ndifferent\u2014and doubly misleading\u2014explanation forVallandigham. First, it says that we found jurisdiction\nlacking because the commission was \u201cwas not one of the \u2018courts of\nthe United States\u2019 established under Article III.\u201dPost, at\n11 (quotingVallandigham, 1 Wall., at 251). But the dissent\nis reading from the wrong part of the opinion.Vallandighamcontained two holdings\u2014first (and relevant here), that Article III\nprecluded the Court from exercising appellate jurisdiction over the\ncommission\u2019s decisions, and second (and irrelevant here), that the\nJudiciary Act of 1789 had not authorized such jurisdiction. The\nlanguage the dissent quotes relates only to the irrelevant\nstatutory holding: The Judiciary Act, the Court explained, confined\nour jurisdiction to decisions of Article III courts, and the\ncommission did not fit under that rubric. By contrast, the language\nwe quote in the text formed the basis of the Court\u2019s constitutional\nholding\u2014which is all that matters here. Second, the dissent\ncontends thatVallandigham\u201crecognizedthat the\nmilitary tribunal had \u2018judicial character,\u2019\u201d even as it found\njurisdiction lacking.Post, at 11. Not so.Vallandighamexpresslyrejectedthe argument that the\ncommission had \u201cjudicial character.\u201d 1 Wall., at 253. Though the\nCourt understood that the commission pronounced guilt and imposed\nsentences, it did not think the commission was acting as a court in\nrendering its decisions. Seeibid.(citingUnited\nStatesv.Ferreira, 13 How. 40, 46\u201347 (1852), in which\nthe Court held that a claims tribunal was without judicial\n\u201ccharacter\u201d and labeled its decisions the \u201caward[s] of a\ncommissioner,\u201d \u201cnot the judgment[s] of a court of\njustice\u201d).9The dissent contends that the\nCAAF\u2019s decisions are not always final because the President,\nrelevant branch secretary, or one of his subordinates must approve\na sentence of death or dismissal from the armed forces before it\ngoes into effect. Seepost, at 28\u201329. But as the Government\nhas explained, the President\u2019s (or other executive official\u2019s)\nauthority at that stage extends only to punishment: It is \u201cakin to\nrelief by commutation in the federal or state system.\u201d Tr. of Oral\nArg. 57; seeLovingv.United States, 62 M.\u00a0J.\n235, 247 (CAAF 2005) (likening the approval authority to \u201cexecutive\nclemency powers\u201d). The President, even when \u201cmitigat[ing a]\nsentence[,]\u201d cannot \u201cupset[ ] the conviction\u201d or \u201cthe judgment of\nthe CAAF.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 55\u201356. Rather, as we said above, the\nCAAF\u2019s judgment is final when issued (except if we reverse it). See\n10 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7871(c)(1) (stating that even when a sentence\nis subject to an executive official\u2019s approval, the \u201cjudgment\u201d is\n\u201cfinal\u201d when judicial review is concluded).10We\nstate no opinion on a broader argument the Government makes\u2014that\n\u00a7950f(b)(2) would exempt Judge Mitchell from \u00a7973(b)(2)(A)\u2019s\noffice-holding ban even if the Secretary had not assigned him to\nthe CMCR before the President\u2019s appointment. See Brief for United\nStates 27\u201329. And because we hold that the Secretary\u2019s assignment\nauthorized Judge Mitchell to serve on the CMCR while an active-duty\nmilitary officer, we need not decide whether a CMCR judgeship is a\ncovered \u201ccivil office\u201d subject to \u00a7973(b)(2)(A). Neither need we\naddress the remedial issue on which the CAAF ruled, seesupra,at 4\u2014i.e.,whether a violation of\n\u00a7973(b)(2)(A) would have immediately terminated Judge Mitchell\u2019s\nmilitary service and voided later decisions he made (including in\nOrtiz\u2019s case) as a military judge.",
