We hold that a reckless\noffense cannot so qualify.ICongress enacted ACCA, as its full name makes\nclear, to address the \u201cspecial danger\u201d associated with \u201carmed\ncareer criminals.\u201dBegayv.United States,553 U.S.\n137, 146 (2008). A \u201csmall percentage of repeat offenders,\u201d\nCongress found, commit a \u201clarge percentage\u201d of all violent crimes.Taylorv.UnitedStates,495\nU.S. 575, 581 (1990) (quoting H.\u00a0R. Rep. No. 98\u20131073,\np.\u00a01 (1984)). And when such a habitual violent offender\ncarries a gun, he poses a serious risk of wreaking harm. As his\nprior convictions reveal, he is \u201cthe kind of person who,\u201d when\narmed, \u201cmight deliberately point the gun and pull the trigger.\u201dBegay, 553 U.\u00a0S., at 146.To allay that danger, ACCA enhances the sentence\nof anyone convicted under 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7922(g) of being a\nfelon in possession of a firearm if he has three or more prior\nconvictions (whether state or federal) for a \u201cviolent felony.\u201d The\nincrease in penalty is severe: A 10-year maximum sentence turns\ninto a 15-year minimum one. See \u00a7924(a)(2), (e)(1). And because\nthat is so, the scope of the statute is closely confined. SeeBegay, 553 U.\u00a0S., at 146 (Congress did not provide for\n\u201ca 15-year mandatory prison term where th[e] increased likelihood\n[of gun violence] does not exist\u201d). The penalty enhancement kicks\nin only when a defendant has committed no fewer than three offenses\nmeeting the statute\u2019s definition of \u201cviolent felony.\u201d That\ndefinition, in addition to ticking off several specific crimes (for\nexample, burglary and arson), includes the so-called elements\nclause, relevant here. An offense qualifies as a violent felony\nunder that clause if it \u201chas as an element the use, attempted use,\nor threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\u201d\n\u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i).To decide whether an offense satisfies the\nelements clause, courts use the categorical approach. SeeStokelingv.United States, 586 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___\n(2019) (slip op., at 13). Under that by-now-familiar method,\napplicable in several statutory contexts, the facts of a given case\nare irrelevant. The focus is instead on whether the elements of the\nstatute of conviction meet the federal standard. Here, that means\nasking whether a state offense necessarily involves the defendant\u2019s\n\u201cuse, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against\nthe person of another.\u201d \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i); seeShularv.United States, 589 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___\u2013___ (2020) (slip op.,\nat 3\u20134). If any\u2014even the least culpable\u2014of the acts criminalized do\nnot entail that kind of force, the statute of conviction does not\ncategorically match the federal standard, and so cannot serve as an\nACCA predicate. SeeJohnsonv.United States,559 U.S.\n133, 137 (2010).In this case, petitioner Charles Borden, Jr.,\npleaded guilty to a felon-in-possession charge, and the Government\nsought an enhanced sentence under ACCA. One of the three\nconvictions alleged as predicates was for reckless aggravated\nassault in violation of Tennessee law. The relevant statute defines\nthat crime as \u201c[r]ecklessly commit[ting] an assault\u201d and either\n\u201ccaus[ing] serious bodily injury to another\u201d or \u201cus[ing] or\ndisplay[ing] a deadly weapon.\u201d Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a739\u201313\u2013102(a)(2)\n(2003); see \u00a739\u201313\u2013101(a)(1). Borden argued that this offense is\nnot a violent felony under ACCA\u2019s elements clause because a mental\nstate of recklessness suffices for conviction. In his view, only\npurposeful or knowing conduct satisfies the clause\u2019s demand for the\nuse of force \u201cagainst the person of another.\u201d The District Court\ndisagreed, holding that reckless offenses qualify as violent\nfelonies and sentencing Borden as a career offender. The Court of\nAppeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed that decision based on\ncircuit precedent\u2014though noting that Borden was \u201cnot alone\u201d in\nviewing the precedent as \u201cwrongly decided.\u201d 769 Fed. Appx. 266, 268\n(2019) (citingUnited Statesv.Verwiebe, 874 F.3d\n258 (CA6 2017)).The circuit courts have indeed differed in\naddressing the question Borden raises. Some have held, as in this\ncase, that a statute covering reckless conduct qualifies as a\nviolent felony under ACCA.[1]\nOthers have concluded that only a statute confined to purposeful or\nknowing conduct can count as such a felony.[2] The dispute turns on the definition of \u201cviolent\nfelony\u201d in ACCA\u2019s elements clause\u2014more specifically, on how\ndifferent mental states map onto the clause\u2019s demand that an\noffense entail the \u201cuse .\u00a0.\u00a0. of physical force against\nthe person of another.\u201d \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i). We granted certiorari to\nresolve the issue. 589 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2020).IITwo pieces of background should ease the way.\nWe begin by setting out four states of mind, as described in modern\nstatutes and cases, that may give rise to criminal liability. Those\nmental states are, in descending order of culpability: purpose,\nknowledge, recklessness, and negligence. We then discuss two prior\ndecisions of this Court addressing questions similar to the one\nhere. In each, the Court considered how a certain mental state\nrelates to a statutory definition marking out a category of crimes.\nOne of those definitions is almost identical to the elements\nclause; the other appropriates only the clause\u2019s first half. The\nCourt\u2019s analyses\u2014about both the statute more like and the statute\nless like the elements clause\u2014help frame today\u2019s decision.Purpose and knowledge are the most culpable\nlevels in the criminal law\u2019s mental-state \u201chierarchy.\u201dUnited\nStatesv.Bailey,444 U.S.\n394, 404 (1980). A person acts purposefully when he\n\u201cconsciously desires\u201d a particular result.Ibid.(internal\nquotation marks omitted); see ALI, Model Penal Code \u00a72.02(2)(a)\n(1985). He acts knowingly when \u201che is aware that [a] result is\npractically certain to follow from his conduct,\u201d whatever his\naffirmative desire.Bailey, 444 U.\u00a0S., at 404 (internal\nquotation marks omitted); see Model Penal Code \u00a72.02(2)(b)(ii). We\nhave characterized the distinction between the two as \u201climited,\u201d\nexplaining that it \u201chas not been considered important\u201d for many\ncrimes.Bailey, 444 U.\u00a0S., at 404 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted); see Model Penal Code, Comment 2, pp. 233\u2013234\n(calling the distinction \u201cnarrow\u201d and often \u201cinconsequential\u201d). A\nperson who injures another knowingly, even though not affirmatively\nwanting the result, still makes a deliberate choice with full\nawareness of consequent harm. SeeBailey, 444 U.\u00a0S., at\n403\u2013404.[3]Recklessness and negligence are less culpable\nmental states because they instead involve insufficient concern\nwith a risk of injury. A person acts recklessly, in the most common\nformulation, when he \u201cconsciously disregards a substantial and\nunjustifiable risk\u201d attached to his conduct, in \u201cgross deviation\u201d\nfrom accepted standards. Model Penal Code \u00a72.02(2)(c); seeVoisinev.United States, 579 U.S. 686, ___ (2016)\n(slip op., at 4). That risk need not come anywhere close to a\nlikelihood. Speeding through a crowded area may count as reckless\neven though the motorist\u2019s \u201cchances of hitting anyone are far less\n[than] 50%.\u201d 1 W. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law \u00a75.4(f\u00a0)\n(2018) (citing cases involving low-probability events). Similarly\n(though one more step down the mental-state hierarchy), a person\nacts negligently if he is not but \u201cshould be aware\u201d of such a\n\u201csubstantial and unjustifiable risk,\u201d again in \u201cgross deviation\u201d\nfrom the norm. Model Penal Code \u00a72.02(2)(d). There, the fault lies\nin the person\u2019s simple \u201cfailure to perceive\u201d the possible\nconsequence of his behavior.Ibid.InLeocalv.Ashcroft,543 U.S. 1(2004), this Court held that offenses requiring only a negligentmens reafall outside a statutory definition relevantly\nidentical to ACCA\u2019s elements clause. That definition, codified at\n18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a716(a), is for the term \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d\nwhich appears in many federal criminal and immigration laws.\nSection 16(a) states, in language that should by now sound\nfamiliar, that a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d means \u201can offense that has as\nan element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical\nforce against the person or property of another.\u201d (In case you\nmissed it, the sole difference between \u00a716(a) and the elements\nclause is the phrase \u201cor property,\u201d which brings property crimes\nwithin the former statute\u2019s ambit.) The question presented was\nwhether that definition covers DUI offenses\u2014for driving under the\ninfluence of alcohol and causing serious bodily injury\u2014that require\nonly a negligent mental state. In addressing that issue, the\nparties had debated whether \u201cthe word \u2018use\u2019 alone supplies amens reaelement.\u201d 543 U.\u00a0S., at 9. But the Court\nthought the focus on that one word \u201ctoo narrow.\u201dIbid.Rather, we said, the \u201ccritical aspect\u201d of \u00a716(a) is its demand that\nthe perpetrator use physical force \u201cagainst the person or\nproperty of another.\u201dIbid.(emphasis in original). As a\nmatter of \u201cordinary or natural meaning,\u201d we explained, that \u201ckey\nphrase .\u00a0.\u00a0. most naturally suggests a higher degree of\nintent than negligent\u201d conduct.Ibid.(internal quotation\nmarks omitted). And confirmation of that view came from the defined\nterm itself. The phrase \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d we reasoned, \u201csuggests\na category of violent, active crimes that cannot be said naturally\nto include\u201d negligent offenses.Id., at 11. All that\nsufficed to resolve the status of the DUI offense at issue. The\nCourt thus reserved the question whether an offense with amens\nreaof recklessness likewise fails to qualify as a crime of\nviolence.Id., at 13.More recently, the Court held that reckless\noffenses fall within a different statutory definition\u2014this one\nlacking the \u201cagainst another\u201d phraseLeocaldeemed\n\u201ccritical.\u201dId., at 9. The law at issue inVoisinev.United Statesbars persons convicted of a \u201cmisdemeanor crime\nof domestic violence\u201d from possessing firearms. 18\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7922(g)(9). That phrase is defined to mean a\nmisdemeanor, committed by a person in a specified domestic\nrelationship with the victim, that \u201chas, as an element, the use or\nattempted use of physical force.\u201d \u00a7921(a)(33)(A). In that truncated\ndefinition, the only language anyone could \u201cthink[\u00a0] relevant\u201d\nwas the word \u201cuse\u201d (the wordLeocal, in construing a longer\ndefinition, deemed not the right focus).Voisine, 579\nU.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 5). The Court understood \u201cuse\u201d as\ndemanding volition\u2014the \u201cactive employment\u201d of force.Id., at\n___\u2013___ (slip op., at 5\u20136). But we thought that lone word\n\u201cindifferent\u201d to whether an actor choosing to employ force had a\nmental state of recklessness, knowledge, or purpose.Id., at\n___ (slip op., at 6). And that reading of \u201cuse,\u201d we continued, is\nthe only one consistent with the statute\u2019s history and purpose.\nCongress enacted \u00a7922(g)(9), we explained, to prevent domestic\nabusers convicted of \u201cgarden-variety [misdemeanor] assault\u201d from\nowning guns\u2014and most such misdemeanors cover reckless conduct.Id., at ___ (slip op., at 8). At each step of the analysis,\nthen, our decision was statute-specific. We made clear that other\nstatutory definitions\u2014whether the one inLeocalor the\nnear-identical one in ACCA\u2019s elements clause\u2014might exclude reckless\noffenses. Seeid., at ___, n.\u00a04 (slip op., at 7,\nn.\u00a04).IIIToday, we reach the question we reserved in\nbothLeocalandVoisine. We must decide whether the\nelements clause\u2019s definition of \u201cviolent felony\u201d\u2014an offense\nrequiring the \u201cuse of physical force against the person of\nanother\u201d\u2014includes offenses criminalizing reckless conduct.[4] We hold that it does not. The phrase\n\u201cagainst another,\u201d when modifying the \u201cuse of force,\u201d demands that\nthe perpetrator direct his action at, or target, another\nindividual. Reckless conduct is not aimed in that prescribed\nmanner. Our reading of the relevant text finds support in its\ncontext and purpose. The treatment of reckless offenses as \u201cviolent\nfelonies\u201d would impose large sentencing enhancements on individuals\n(for example, reckless drivers) far afield from the \u201carmed career\ncriminals\u201d ACCA addresses\u2014the kind of offenders who, when armed,\ncould well \u201cuse [the] gun deliberately to harm a victim.\u201dBegay, 553 U.\u00a0S., at 145. And contra the Government\n(and dissent),Voisinesays nothing to the contrary.A1The parties here dispute the meaning of the\nphrase \u201cuse of physical force against the person of another.\u201d They\nstart in the same place, as they must: The \u201cuse of physical force,\u201d\nasVoisineheld, means the \u201cvolitional\u201d or \u201cactive\u201d\nemployment of force. 579 U.\u00a0S., at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 5\u20136).\nThe fight begins with the word \u201cagainst.\u201d According to Borden, that\nword means \u201cin opposition to,\u201d and so \u201cintroduces the target of the\npreceding action.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 19 (citing dictionaries).\nExamples are easy to muster: The general deployed his forces\nagainst a rival regiment, or the chess master played the Queen\u2019s\nGambit against her opponent. The Government responds that \u201cagainst\u201d\ninstead means \u201cmak[ing] contact with,\u201d and so introduces the mere\nrecipient of force rather than its \u201cintended target.\u201d Brief for\nUnited States 23\u201324 (also citing dictionaries). As examples, the\nGovernment offers: \u201cwaves crashing against the shore or a baseball\nhitting against the outfield fence.\u201dId.,at 23 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). The difference in meaning, both parties\nagree, matters for this case. Brief for Petitioner 19\u201321; Brief for\nUnited States 23\u201324. If \u201cagainst,\u201d as used here, expresses a kind\nof directedness or targeting, then recklessness\u2014as even the\nGovernment concedes\u2014falls outside the elements clause. Seeid., at 26 (noting that the oppositional definition of\n\u201cagainst\u201d would exclude \u201ca defendant who recklessly causes\ninjury\u201d). Only if the \u201cagainst\u201d phrase lacks that connotation\u2014if,\nas the Government argues, it is indifferent to whether the conduct\nis directed at another\u2014can the elements clause include reckless\noffenses.Id., at 23.Borden\u2019s view of \u201cagainst,\u201d as introducing the\nconscious object (not the mere recipient) of the force, is the\nright one given the rest of the elements clause. Dictionaries offer\ndefinitions of \u201cagainst\u201d consistent with both parties\u2019 view: The\nword can mean either \u201c[i]n opposition to\u201d or \u201cin contact with,\u201d\ndepending on the context. See,e.g., Webster\u2019s New\nInternational Dictionary 46 (2d ed. 1957) (giving both\ndefinitions). The critical context here is the language that\n\u201cagainst another\u201d modifies\u2014the \u201cuse of physical force.\u201d As just\nexplained, \u201cuse of force\u201d denotes volitional conduct. And the\npairing of volitional action with the word \u201cagainst\u201d supports that\nword\u2019s oppositional, or targeted, definition. Look once more at the\nexamples offered in the last paragraph. Borden\u2019s involve volitional\nconduct, by the general or chess master\u2014essentially, each actor\u2019s\n\u201cuse of force.\u201d There, the \u201cagainst\u201d phrase reveals at whom the\nconduct is consciously directed: the rival army or player. In\ncontrast, the Government\u2019s examples do not involve volitional\nconduct, because \u201cwaves\u201d and \u201cbaseballs\u201d have no volition\u2014and\nindeed, cannot naturally be said to \u201cuse force\u201d at all. There, an\n\u201cagainst\u201d clause merely names a thing with which the subject came\ninto contact.[5] For our\npurpose, the more apt examples are Borden\u2019s. As in those examples,\nACCA\u2019s \u201cagainst\u201d phrase modifies volitional conduct (i.e.,the use of force). So that phrase, too, refers to the conduct\u2019s\nconscious object. Indeed, the Court has made a similar point\nbefore, in an opinion by one of its great wordsmiths. When citizens\n\u201cbear [a]rms against\u201d some entity, Justice Scalia wrote, what\nfollows the word \u201cagainst\u201d is \u201cthe target of the hostilities.\u201dDistrict of Columbiav.Heller,554 U.S.\n570, 586 (2008) (internal quotation marks omitted). That is\njust as true when someone, as in the elements clause, actively\nemploys physical force.On that understanding, the clause covers\npurposeful and knowing acts, but excludes reckless conduct (as,\nonce again, the Government concedes). See Brief for United States\n26; seesupra,at 8\u20139. Purposeful conduct is obvious.\nSuppose a person drives his car straight at a reviled neighbor,\ndesiring to hit him. The driver has, in the statute\u2019s words,\n\u201cuse[d] .\u00a0.\u00a0. physical force against the person of\nanother.\u201d The same holds true for knowing behavior. Say a getaway\ndriver sees a pedestrian in his path but plows ahead anyway,\nknowing the car will run him over. That driver, too, fits within\nthe statute: Although he would prefer a clear road, he too drives\nhis car straight at a known victim. Or said otherwise, both drivers\n(even though for different reasons) have consciously deployed the\nfull force of an automobile at another person. SeeUnited\nStatesv.United States Gypsum,438\nU.S. 422, 445 (1978) (explaining that the law thus views both\nas \u201cintend[ing]\u201d the result). But that is not so of a reckless (or\na negligent) actor. Imagine a commuter who, late to work, decides\nto run a red light, and hits a pedestrian whom he did not see. The\ncommuter has consciously disregarded a real risk, thus endangering\nothers. And he has ended up making contact with another person, as\nthe Government emphasizes. See Brief for United States 23. But as\nthe Government just as readily acknowledges, the reckless driver\nhas not directed force at another: He has not trained his car at\nthe pedestrian understanding he will run him over. Seeid.,at 26. To the contrary, his fault is to pay insufficient attention\nto the potential application of force. Because that is so\u2014because\nhis conduct is not opposed to or directed at another\u2014he does not\ncome within the elements clause. He has not used force \u201cagainst\u201d\nanother person in the targeted way that clause requires.Leocalconfirms our conclusion. Although\nthe Court reserved the question we decide today, its reasoning all\nbut precludes the Government\u2019s answer. Recall thatLeocalheld that negligent conduct falls outside a statutory definition\nmuch like the elements clause\u2014one requiring the use of physical\nforce \u201cagainst the person or property of another.\u201d 18\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a716(a); see 543 U.\u00a0S., at 9;supra,at 5\u20136. In thus excluding crimes with a negligentmens rea,\nthe Court reasoned just as we have today. When read against the\nwords \u201cuse of force,\u201d the \u201cagainst\u201d phrase\u2014the definition\u2019s\n\u201ccritical aspect\u201d\u2014\u201csuggests a higher degree of intent\u201d than (at\nleast) negligence. 543 U.\u00a0S., at 9. That view of \u00a716(a)\u2019s\n\u201cagainst\u201d phrase\u2014as incorporating amens rearequirement\u2014contradicts the Government\u2019s (and dissent\u2019s) view here\nthat a materially identical phrase is \u201cnot a roundabout way\u201d of\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. incorporating amens rearequirement. Brief\nfor United States 9. The Government thus asks us to read ACCA\u2019s\nelements clause\u2014specifically, its \u201cagainst\u201d phrase, modifying the\n\u201cuse of force\u201d\u2014contrary to how we have read near-identical words\nbefore.Even the single difference between the two\nstatutes works against the Government: On its reading, \u00a716(a)\u2019s two\nadded words would turn that provision\u2019s \u201cagainst\u201d phrase into\nsurplusage. The problem begins with the Government\u2019s attempt to\ngive ACCA\u2019s own \u201cagainst\u201d phrase meaning. If not to incorporate an\nintent requirement, what function does that phrase serve? The\nGovernment\u2019s theory is that the phrase limits the elements clause\nto crimes involving force against people, as opposed to property.\nSeeid., at 23. That would give the clause some work to do\nin ACCA. But as noted earlier, the statute at issue inLeocaldoes not make that distinction: To repeat, \u00a716(a)\u2019s\n\u201cagainst\u201d phrase refers to uses of force \u201cagainst the personor\npropertyof another.\u201d \u00a716(a) (emphasis added); seesupra,at 6. In other words, \u00a716(a) listsbothof the\ntwo (and only two) plausible objects of force. So the Government\u2019s\nintent-less reading would leave the \u201cagainst\u201d phrase in \u00a716(a)\nwithout any function; it would render the phrase surplusage. Far\nfrom thinking such a thing possible, theLeocalCourt\nconsidered \u00a716(a)\u2019s \u201cagainst\u201d phrase \u201ckey\u201d and \u201ccritical\u201d\u2014again,\nbecause it (in combination with the \u201cuse of force\u201d language)\ndefines the requisite \u201cdegree of intent.\u201d 543 U.\u00a0S., at 9.\nUnlike the Government, we favor a construction consonant with that\nview. The \u201cagainst\u201d phrase indeed sets out amens rearequirement\u2014of purposeful or knowing conduct.2The dissent offers up two\n\u201calternative\u201d\u2014really, mutually inconsistent\u2014counter-arguments about\nthe elements clause\u2019s text. In the first, the dissent claims to\nfind a \u201cterm of art\u201d in the clause\u2014implicitly admitting that the\nlanguage, as ordinarily understood, excludes reckless conduct. SeeWest Virginia Univ. Hospitals, Inc.v.Casey,499 U.S.\n83, 92, n.\u00a05 (1991) (noting that terms of art\n\u201cdepartfrom ordinary meaning\u201d). Here, the dissent is all on\nits own: Neither the Government nor any of the many courts that\nhave looked at this issue has advanced this term-of-art theory. In\nthe second, the dissent goes more conventional, essentially\nrepeating what the Government says, though with a distinctively\nquestion-begging quality. The term-of-art claim fails because the\ndissent\u2019s proposed term does not appear in\u2014and indeed differs in\ncritical ways from\u2014the elements clause\u2019s text. The ordinary-meaning\nclaim fails for reasons already familiar.The dissent tries to sidestep the parties\u2019\ndispute over ordinary meaning by depicting the \u201cagainst\u201d phrase as\na \u201cterm of art\u201d having \u201czero to do withmens rea.\u201dPost, at 5, 13 (opinion of Kavanaugh, J.). In the dissent\u2019s\nwords: \u201c[W]e should not disregard the longstanding meaning of a\ncriminal-law term of art\u2014namely, offenses against the person\u2014to\nsmuggle\u201d amens rearequirement into the elements clause.Post, at 13. The dissent here relies on the appearance in\nmany state criminal codes of headings and captions using the phrase\n\u201cOffenses Against the Person.\u201dPost,at 7; see,e.g.,La. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 14, ch. 1, pt. 2 (West 2016) (listing\noffenses\u2014spanning homicide, negligent DUI, and defamation\u2014under the\nchapter heading \u201coffenses against the person\u201d).But note how this argument breaks down at its\nfirst move: The dissent offers up a \u201cterm of art\u201d that is nowhere\nin the statute the dissent is supposed to be construing. The\ndissent does not pretend that the statutory phrase \u201cuse of physical\nforce against the person of another\u201d is a term of art; there is\nnot, even in the dissent\u2019s imagining, any historical or distinctly\nlegal meaning associated with that language. The dissent instead\ninsists on reading into ACCA a term-of-art meaning for a\nphrase\u2014\u201coffenses against the person\u201d\u2014that makes no appearance\nthere. That is no way to do statutory construction. The first\nprecondition of any term-of-art reading is that the term be present\nin the disputed statute. Here, it is not. SeeFood Marketing\nInstitutev.Argus Leader Media, 588 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___\n(2019) (slip op., at 10) (similarly rejecting an attempt to\n\u201crearrang[e]\u201d statutory text to create a \u201cterm of art\u201d that \u201cdoes\nnot appear in the statute\u201d).And indeed, the dissent\u2019s extra-statutory term\ndiffers in a critical way from the actual language of the actual\nelements clause. As discussed above, the \u201cagainst\u201d phrase in that\nclause modifies the \u201cuse of physical force\u201d\u2014language this Court has\nheld (and the dissent concedes) denotes volitional conduct. It is,\nas explained above, the pairing of volitional action with the word\n\u201cagainst\u201d that produces its oppositional or directed meaning\u2014and\nexcludes recklessness from the statute. Seesupra,at 9\u201310.\nNor is that only our explanation: As noted earlier,Leocalsaid the identical thing about nearly identical statutory language,\nfocusing on the interplay of \u201cuse\u201d and \u201cagainst\u201d to conclude that\nthe language had everything\u2014not \u201czero\u201d\u2014to do withmens rea.\nSee 543 U.\u00a0S., at 9 (holding that the whole phrase \u201cmost\nnaturally suggests a higher degree of intent\u201d);supra, at\n11. So it is no small thing that the dissent, in its term-of-art\nmachinations, removes the verb phrase \u201cuse of physical force\u201d and\nsubstitutes the simple noun \u201coffenses.\u201d In so doing, it has\nreplaced the very thing that shapes the \u201cagainst\u201d phrase\u2019s meaning.\nOnce again, statutory construction does not work that way: A court\ndoes not get to delete inconvenient language and insert convenient\nlanguage to yield the court\u2019s preferred meaning.Finally, consider where the dissent looks for\nits supposed \u201coffenses against the person\u201d term of art. Not to any\nstatute defining crimes or setting penalties (as ACCA does). Rather\nto headings and captions designed to cover a myriad of offenses,\nfrom homicide through defamation. They are umbrella terms used for\ncataloguing crimes\u2014nothing more. That is why the dissent cites no\njudicial decision construing the term, much less saying anything\nabout what it means formens rea. The term cannot have a\ntraditional or commonplace meaning in statutes specifying criminal\nconduct: It does not appear in them in the first place.In a nutshell, the dissent\u2019s \u201cterm of art\u201d\ntheory goes as follows: Congress took an umbrella term (\u201coffenses\nagainst the person\u201d) used to organize a broad set of crimes (some\nnot even conceivably ACCA predicates); plucked out three words\n(\u201cagainst the person\u201d); appended them to a statutory phrase (\u201cuse\nof physical force\u201d) with which they are not often associated; put\nthe combination into a substantive criminal statute\u2014all to signify,\ncontraLeocal, a term of art indifferent tomens rea.\nNo wonder the dissent is the first to make the argument. Seesupra,at 12. It fails at every turn.And so the dissent must proceed to its\nordinary-meaning claim, reprising (if at higher volume) the\nGovernment\u2019s flawed argument about what the \u201cagainst\u201d phrase is\nmost naturally read to encompass. Here, the dissent insists that\nbecause reckless force can make contact with a person\u2014e.g.,\nbecause a reckless driver can run over a pedestrian\u2014the statute\nmust encompass that conduct. Seepost, at 20\u201322. But that\njust assumes the conclusion: The very question here is whether the\nstatutory language Congress enacted requires that force be directed\nat, rather than just happen to hit, an object. As to that issue,\nthe dissent asserts that \u201c[s]tate and federal reporters\u201d are\n\u201creplete with references to individuals recklessly using force\nagainst others.\u201dPost, at 18\u201319, and n. 15 (quoting, for\nexample, a decision saying that a \u201cjury found that Arton did not\nintentionally or recklessly use excessive force against Cook\u201d). But\nonce again, the dissent is putting the rabbit in the hat. If\nCongress had used the word \u201crecklessly\u201d in the elements clause, we\nwould have to interpret that clause to cover reckless offenses,\neven though the best reading of the clause without that word goes\nthe other way. But Congress did not say \u201crecklessly.\u201d And we must\nconstrue the elements clause as it is\u2014without first inserting the\nword that will (presto!) produce the dissent\u2019s reading.[6]BWere there any doubt about the elements\nclause\u2019s meaning, context and purpose would remove it.The elements clause defines a \u201cviolent felony,\u201d\nand that term\u2019s ordinary meaning informs our construction.Leocalwell expressed this idea: In interpreting \u00a716(a), \u201cwe\ncannot forget that we ultimately are determining the meaning of the\nterm \u2018crime of violence.\u2019\u00a0\u201d 543 U.\u00a0S., at 11. Quoting\nthat statement,Johnsonv.United Statessaid the\nsame thing when construing language (there, the term \u201cphysical\nforce\u201d) in ACCA\u2019s definition of \u201cviolent felony.\u201d 559 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 140. \u201cUltimately, context determines meaning,\u201d we wrote, and\n\u201c[h]ere we are interpreting\u201d a phrase \u201cas used in defining\u201d the\nterm \u201cviolentfelony.\u201dId.,at 139\u2013140. With that\nfocus in place, both decisions construed the definitions at issue\nto mark out a narrow \u201ccategory of violent, active crimes.\u201dId.,at 140; 543 U.\u00a0S., at 11. And those crimes are\nbest understood to involve not only a substantial degree of force,\nbut also a purposeful or knowing mental state\u2014a deliberate choice\nof wreaking harm on another, rather than mere indifference to risk.\nAsLeocalexplained: The term \u201ccrime of violence\u201d in \u00a716(a)\n\u201ccannot be said naturally to include DUI offenses\u201d\u2014typically crimes\nof recklessness or negligence.Ibid.In a case much like\nthis one, then-Judge Alito reiterated the point. He wrote that\n\u201c[t]he quintessential violent crimes,\u201d like murder or rape,\n\u201cinvolve the intentional use\u201d of force.Oyebanjiv.Gonzales,418 F.3d 260, 264 (CA3 2005). By contrast, drunk driving and\nother crimes of recklessness, though \u201cmoral[ly] culpab[le],\u201d do not\nfit within \u201cthe ordinary meaning of the term \u2018violent\u2019 crime.\u201dIbid.Nor does the classification of reckless crimes\nas \u201cviolent felonies\u201d comport with ACCA\u2019s purpose. Congress enacted\nACCA, as noted earlier, to address \u201cthe special danger created when\na particular type of offender\u2014a violent criminal[\u00a0]\u2014possesses\na gun.\u201dBegay, 553 U.\u00a0S., at 146; seesupra,at\n1\u20132. In keeping with that concern, ACCA sets out to identify, for\nsentencing purposes, the eponymous \u201carmed career criminal\u201d\u2014the sort\nof offender who, when armed, \u201cmight deliberately point the gun and\npull the trigger.\u201dBegay, 553 U.\u00a0S.,at 145\u2013146.\nThe Act discharges that goal by looking to a person\u2019s criminal\nhistory. An offender who has repeatedly committed \u201cpurposeful,\nviolent, and aggressive\u201d crimes, we have explained, poses an\nuncommon danger of \u201cus[ing a] gun deliberately to harm a victim.\u201dId.,at 145. But that is not so\u2014as this Court has\nrecognized\u2014of someone convicted of a crime, like a DUI offense,\nrevealing only a \u201cdegree of callousness toward risk.\u201dId.,\nat 146. However blameworthy, the reckless (or negligent) conduct\ninvolved in such a crime is \u201cfar removed\u201d from the \u201cdeliberate kind\nof behavior associated with violent criminal use of firearms.\u201dId., at 147. So there is no reason, consistent with ACCA\u2019s\nfocus on armed career criminals, for reckless offenses to\nprecipitate the statute\u2019s enhanced sentences.[7]Consider the kinds of crimes\u2014the too-common\nstuff of ordinary offenders\u2014that would trigger ACCA\u2019s 15-year\nminimums if we adopted the Government\u2019s (or dissent\u2019s) position.\nMany convictions for reckless crimes result from unsafe driving.\nUnder the same Tennessee reckless-assault law applied to Borden,\npeople have been convicted for injuries attributable to running a\nstop sign or veering onto the sidewalk. SeeStatev.Graham, 2008 WL 199851, *2\u2013*4 (Tenn. Crim. App., Jan. 24,\n2008);Statev.Gillon, 15 S.W.3d 492, 496\u2013497 (Tenn.\nCrim. App. 1997). In States with similar statutes requiring only a\nrecklessmens rea, many individuals have been convicted for\naccidents resulting from text messaging or, of course, drunk\ndriving. See,e.g.,Statev.Belleville, 166\nN.\u00a0H. 58, 63\u201364, 88 A.3d 918, 922 (2014);Statev.Reando, 313 S.W.3d 734, 740 (Mo. App. 2010). In one case,\neven a police officer was convicted of a reckless assault for\nspeeding to a crime scene without his siren on and hitting another\npatrol car. SeeSeatonv.State, 385 S.W.3d 85, 88\u201389\n(Tex. Crim. App. 2012). Or take some real-life non-driving\nexamples. A shoplifter jumps off a mall\u2019s second floor balcony\nwhile fleeing security only to land on a customer. SeeCraverv.State, 2015 WL 3918057, *2 (Tex. App., June\n25, 2015). An experienced skier heads straight down a steep,\nmogul-filled slope, \u201cback on his skis, arms out to his sides,\noff-balance\u201d\u2014until he careens into someone else on the hill.Peoplev.Hall,999 P.2d 207, 211 (Colo. 2000). Or a father takes his\ntwo-year-old go-karting without safety equipment, and injures her\nas he takes a sharp turn. SeeStatev.Gimino, 2015\nWL 13134204, *1 (Wis. App., Apr. 15, 2015).Are these really ACCA predicates? All the\ndefendants in the cases just described acted recklessly, taking\nsubstantial and unjustified risks. And all the defendants hurt\nother people, some seriously, along the way. But few would say\ntheir convictions were for \u201cviolent felonies.\u201d SeeLeocal,\n543 U.\u00a0S., at 4 (holding that a \u201cDUI causing serious bodily\ninjury\u201d is not a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d). Few would think their\noffenses of a kind \u201ctypically committed by\u201d armed career criminals.Begay, 553 U.\u00a0S.,at 146. And few would believe\nthose defendants to pose an exceptional danger of doing harm were\nthey to possess a gun. Seeid., at 145\u2013146. Extending the\nelements clause to reckless offenses would thus do exactly whatLeocaldecried: \u201cblur the distinction between the \u2018violent\u2019\ncrimes Congress sought to distinguish for heightened punishment and\n[all] other crimes.\u201d 543 U.\u00a0S., at 11.[8]The Government\u2019s response (echoed in the\ndissent)\u2014that statutes covering reckless conduct can also\n\u201ccover[\u00a0] classically violent crimes\u201d\u2014has no purchase given\nACCA\u2019s categorical approach. Brief for United States 41; seepost,at 34\u201337. The Government lists, for example, several\nprosecutions for serious beatings brought under the Tennessee law\nprohibiting reckless aggravated assault. See Brief for United\nStates 42 (describing cases in which a defendant \u201cslamm[ed] his\nfist into the face of a man\u201d and another defendant \u201clooked the\nvictim directly in the eye\u201d and kicked her). In those cases, the\nState presumably decided to charge a defendant with reckless\n(rather than purposeful or knowing) assault because of some problem\nor idiosyncrasy in the case. (In the two cases described, for\ninstance, one of the defendants was high on drugs, and the other\nhad a plausible self-defense claim.) But under the categorical\napproach, the existence of such cases is neither here nor there. An\noffense does not qualify as a \u201cviolent felony\u201d unless theleastserious conduct it covers falls within the elements\nclause. SeeMoncrieffev.Holder,569 U.S.\n184, 190\u2013191 (2013) (\u201cBecause we examine what the state\nconviction necessarily involved, not the facts underlying the case,\nwe must presume that the conviction rested upon nothing more than\nthe least of the acts criminalized\u201d (alterations and internal\nquotation marks omitted));supra,at 2\u20133. That approach is\nunder-inclusive by design: Itexpectsthat some violent\nacts, because charged under a law applying to non-violent conduct,\nwill not trigger enhanced sentences. So what matters are not the\nconvictions the Government offers, but those for, say, running a\nstop sign or skiing too wildly. Because a law criminalizing\nrecklessness covers\u2014indeed, was likely designed for\u2014that kind of\nconduct, the offense cannot count as a violent felony.CTo all of this, the Government offers one main\nresponse: this Court\u2019s decision inVoisine. (And again, the\ndissent reiterates the Government\u2019s arguments. Seepost,at\n23\u201330.) As described earlier,Voisineheld that the\ndefinition of \u201cmisdemeanor crime of domestic violence\u201d\u2014featuring\nthe simple phrase \u201cuse of physical force\u201d\u2014includes reckless\nconduct. 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a7922(g)(9), 921(a)(33)(A); seesupra,at 6\u20137. The Government acknowledges thatVoisineexpressly left open the question presented here. See\n579 U.\u00a0S., at ___, n.\u00a04 (slip op., at 7, n.\u00a04). But\nin the Government\u2019s view, the \u201clogic\u201d of that decision establishes\nthat ACCA\u2019s elements clause, too, covers reckless offenses. Brief\nfor United States 14. \u201cVoisine\u2019s key insight,\u201d the\nGovernment says, \u201cis that the word \u2018use\u2019 refers to the \u2018act of\nemploying something\u2019 and does not require a purposeful or knowing\nstate of mind.\u201dIbid.(internal quotation marks omitted).\nThat insight, the Government concludes, \u201capplies equally to the\nACCA\u2019s elements clause.\u201dId.,at 8. But the Government\u2019s\nargument ignores the textual difference between the two\nstatutes\u2014not the word \u201cuse\u201d (which is indeed the same), but the\n\u201cagainst\u201d phrase on which our holding is based. And so too, the\nargument disregards how the context and purpose of the statute inVoisinediverge from those of ACCA\u2019s elements clause.Most important, the two statutes\u2019 texts, when\nread in their entirety, refute the Government\u2019s (and the dissent\u2019s)\nposition. The domestic violence definition inVoisinerefers\nonly to offenses involving the \u201cuse of physical force\u201d; it lacks\nthe ensuing phrase \u201cagainst the person of another.\u201dVoisinethus focused exclusively on the word \u201cuse\u201d\u2014as the Court noted,\n\u201c[t]he only statutory language either party [thought] relevant.\u201d\n579 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 5). That word, the Court\nexplained, requires a volitional act, but not a purposeful or\nknowingmens rea. Seeid., at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at\n5\u20136). And so we would say again today. For themens rearequirement we find in ACCA\u2019s elements clause does not come from\nthe word \u201cuse.\u201d It instead comes from modifying language that is\nmissing in the domestic-violence provision (and missing, too, in\nthe Government\u2019s argument): \u201cagainst the person of another.\u201d That\nphrase, asLeocalrecognized, is not window dressing: It is\nthe \u201ccritical\u201d text for deciding the level ofmens reaneeded. 543 U.\u00a0S., at 9. As we have explained, \u201cagainst the\nperson of another,\u201d when modifying the \u201cuse of physical force,\u201d\nintroduces that action\u2019s conscious object. Seesupra,at\n9\u201310. So it excludes conduct, like recklessness, that is not\ndirected or targeted at another. BecauseVoisineconstrued a\nstatutory provision without that intent-laden language, the\ndecision cannot tell us what ACCA\u2019s elements clause requires. SeeWalkerv.United States, 931 F.3d 467, 469\u2013470 (CA6\n2019) (Kethledge, J., dissenting from denial of reh\u2019g en banc)\n(\u201cVoisinetells us what \u2018use\u2019 means, not what \u2018against the\nperson of another\u2019 means\u201d). Thus does a \u201cdifference in text\nyield[\u00a0] a difference in meaning.\u201dId., at\n468.[9]Likewise, context and purpose distinguish the\ntwo statutes. The provision inVoisinedefines not a\n\u201cviolent felony\u201d but a \u201cmisdemeanor crime of domestic violence.\u201d It\nfocuses on those convicted not of serious felony offenses, but\ninstead of \u201cgarden-variety assault or battery misdemeanors.\u201d 579\nU.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 8). And it captures not \u201cviolent,\nactive\u201d conduct alone, seesupra,at 16\u201317, but also \u201cacts\nthat one might not characterize as \u2018violent\u2019 in a nondomestic\ncontext.\u201dUnited Statesv.Castleman,572 U.S.\n157, 165 (2014) (referring to \u201c[m]inor uses of force\u201d like\n\u201cgrabbing [and] pinching\u201d). Given those surrounding differences in\ncoverage, it is hardly remarkable that the domestic violence\nprovision would include reckless behavior when ACCA\u2019s elements\nclause does not. And relatedly, the two statutes accomplish\ndissimilar things. The provision inVoisineadds\nmisdemeanant domestic abusers to a long list of people (including\nfelons, substance abusers, and the mentally ill) disqualified from\npossessing a gun. See \u00a7922(g)(1)\u2013(9);Castleman, 572\nU.\u00a0S., at 166\u2013167. The recidivist offenders to whom ACCA\napplies are already subject to that disability. The statute\nadditionally imposes on them\u2014precisely because they are \u201carmed\ncareer criminals,\u201d not ordinary offenders\u2014greatly enhanced prison\nsentences. So again, we see nothing surprising\u2014rather, the\nopposite\u2014in the two statutes\u2019 dissimilar treatment of reckless\ncrimes.IVOffenses with amens reaof\nrecklessness do not qualify as violent felonies under ACCA. They do\nnot require, as ACCA does, the active employment of force against\nanother person. And they are not the stuff of armed career\ncriminals. The judgment below is therefore reversed, and the case\nis remanded for further proceedings consistent with this\nopinion.It is so ordered.Notes1SeeUnited Statesv.Burris, 920 F.3d 942, 951 (CA5 2019);United\nStatesv.Haight, 892 F.3d 1271, 1281 (CADC 2018);United Statesv.Pam, 867 F.3d 1191, 1207\u20131208 (CA10\n2017);United Statesv.Fogg, 836 F.3d 951, 956 (CA8\n2016).2SeeUnited Statesv.Begay, 934 F.3d 1033, 1039 (CA9 2019);United\nStatesv.Moss, 920 F.3d 752, 756 (CA11 2019), vacated\npending reh\u2019g en banc.3The difference between\npurpose and knowledge matters for certain \u201cclasses of crimes,\u201d\nwhere \u201cheightened culpability has been thought to merit special\nattention.\u201dUnited Statesv.Bailey,444 U.S.\n394, 405 (1980). The most typical examples are inchoate crimes\n(conspiracy or attempts) and accessory liability (aiding and\nabetting). There, a purposeful mental state may help separate\ncriminal conduct from innocent behavior. Seeibid.;United Statesv.Falcone, 109 F.2d 579, 581 (CA2\n1940) (L. Hand, J.); Model Penal Code, Comment 2, p. 234. We have\nno occasion to address those offenses, nor the relationship more\ngenerally between purpose and knowledge.4Some States recognize\nmental states (often called \u201cdepraved heart\u201d or \u201cextreme\nrecklessness\u201d) between recklessness and knowledge. We have no\noccasion to address whether offenses with those mental states fall\nwithin the elements clause.5In similar manner, the\nexamples that dictionaries give of the \u201cin contact with\u201d meaning of\n\u201cagainst\u201d all involve non-volitional conduct. See,e.g.,\nAmerican Heritage Dictionary 23 (1981) (those same big \u201cwaves\ndashing against the shore\u201d); Webster\u2019s New International\nDictionary, at 46 (\u201chail beats against the roof\u00a0\u201d); Webster\u2019s\nThird New International Dictionary 39 (1981) (\u201cthe fighter was\nknocked back against the ropes\u201d). By contrast, when the\ndictionaries discuss the \u201cin opposition to\u201d meaning, their examples\nturn volitional. Seeid.,at 39 (\u201ca successful campaign\nagainst the enemy\u201d); American Heritage Dictionary, at 23 (a\n\u201cstruggle against fate\u201d).6The dissent also goes\nthrough a complicated counting exercise about how different\nJustices have divided in this and two other cases, apparently to\nshow how unfair it is that the dissent\u2019s view has not prevailed\nhere. Seepost,at 4, n.\u00a03. But there is nothing\nparticularly unusual about today\u2019s line-up. Four Justices think\nthat the \u201cuse\u201d phrase, as modified by the \u201cagainst\u201d phrase, in\nACCA\u2019s elements clause excludes reckless conduct. One Justice\nthinks, consistent with his previously stated view, that the \u201cuse\u201d\nphrase alone accomplishes that result. Seepost,at 2\n(Thomas, J., concurring in judgment). And that makes five to answer\nthe question presented. Q: Does the elements clause exclude\nreckless conduct? A: Yes, it does.7The dissent would upend\nour consistent view of Congress\u2019s purpose by treating as ACCA\npredicates not just \u201cpurposeful, violent, and aggressive\u201d crimes\nbut the disregard-of-risk offenses we have found \u201cfar removed.\u201dBegay, 553 U.\u00a0S., at 145, 147. The \u201cline for criminal\nliability,\u201d the dissent argues, is generally drawn at recklessness,\nand so the Model Penal Code \u201cestablishes recklessness as the\ndefault minimummens rea.\u201dPost, at 15, 16. But we\nhave never suggested that the threshold for criminal liability is\nthe threshold for ACCA, or that ACCA is about offenders who meet\n\u201cminimum\u201d requirements. To the contrary. As just noted, we have\ninsisted on a higher threshold: ACCA predicates are the crimes\n\u201ctypically committed by those whom one normally labels \u2018armed\ncareer criminals\u2019\u00a0\u201d\u2014whose very possession of a gun poses a\n\u201cspecial danger.\u201dBegay, 553 U.\u00a0S., at\n146.8The dissent\u2014once again,\ncontrary to the statute\u2019s design\u2014would blur that distinction, on\nthe ground that crimes like reckless driving can cause great harm.\nSeepost,at 32\u201334. Of course they can. But in viewing that\nfact as controlling, the dissent runs into not just ACCA but pretty\nmuch all of sentencing law. That law almost invariably turns on\nmental state as well as harm. Consider the Tennessee statute giving\nrise to this case. Borden\u2019s reckless assault conviction carried a\nsentence of two to twelve years; but had he been convicted of\npurposeful or knowing assault, the sentencing range would have been\nthree to fifteen years. Compare Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a739\u201313\u2013102(2),\n40\u201335\u2013111(b)(4), with \u00a7\u00a739\u201313\u2013102(1), 40\u201335\u2013111(b)(3). In imposing\nlesser penalties for recklessness, Tennessee\u2014like the mine run of\nStates with similar penalty schemes\u2014is not suggesting that such\noffenses are \u201cbenign.\u201dPost,at 15. They are recognizing,\nthough, that mental state matters to culpability\u2014and more, that an\nact done recklessly often should not receive as harsh a punishment\nas the same act done purposefully or knowingly, even when the two\ncause the same harm. That approach is the one ACCA takes in\nreserving enhanced penalties for multiple instances of purposeful\nand knowing, but not reckless, conduct. The dissent would write a\ndifferent statute, based on a different theory of criminal\npunishment. But the dissent\u2019s preferred approach is not the one\nCongress enacted into law. And the dissent does not get to tell\nCongress that, in writing the statute it wrote, it failed to\nenhance penalties for gun possession enough.9In one paragraph of its\nbrief, the Government tries to erase this textual difference by\ninvoking a sentence inVoisinethat uses the word \u201cagainst.\u201d\nSee Brief for United States 24. (The dissent does the same, if at\ngreater length. Seepost,at 19\u201320, 26\u201327.) Recall that the\ndomestic violence statute bars someone from owning a gun if he has\nbeen convicted of a misdemeanor that has, as an element, the \u201cuse\u201d\nof physical force \u201ccommitted by a current or former spouse, parent,\nor guardian of the victim\u201d or by a person in another of three\nspecified relations with the victim. \u00a7921(a)(33)(A); seesupra,at 6\u20137. Rather than echo that awkward construction,\nthe Court used shorthand, describing the statute as applying to a\nperson with a \u201cmisdemeanor conviction for the \u2018use .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nof physical force\u2019 against a domestic relation.\u201d 579 U.\u00a0S., at\n___ (slip op., at 12). In the Government\u2019s view, that line shows\nthat we \u201ctreated the statuteas ifit contained a\nprepositional phrase similar to the ACCA\u2019s\u201d (and still found it to\ninclude reckless conduct). Brief for United States 24. We think\nthat a stretch. The locution shows only that sometimes we do not\nparaphrase complex statutory language as well as we might. (Mea\nculpa.) What matters inVoisineis not a one-line\ndescription, but a pages-long analysis of the statutory text\u2014and\nthat discussion gives no support to the Government. Rather than\nimply an \u201cagainst\u201d clause,Voisinefocused like a laser on\nthe meaning of \u201cuse\u201d\u2014because we understood the statute to say\nnothing else. See,e.g.,579 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 5) (\u201cNothing in the word \u2018use\u2019\u2014which is the only statutory\nlanguage either party thinks relevant\u2014indicates that \u00a7922(g)(9)\napplies exclusively to knowing or intentional domestic assaults.\u201d);id., at ___ (slip op., at 6) (citing examples to show \u201cthe\nordinary meaning of the word \u2018use\u2019\u00a0\u201d). \u201c[T]he language of an\nopinion,\u201d we have stated, \u201cis not always to be parsed as though we\nwere dealing with language of a statute.\u201dReiterv.Sonotone Corp.,442 U.S.\n330, 341 (1979). And that is most obviously true when an\nopinion\u2019s language revises (for easier reading) the statute\u2019s own.\nBetter to heed the statutory language proper.",
