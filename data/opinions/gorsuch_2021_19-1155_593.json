GARLAND, ATTORNEY GENERAL,\nPETITIONER19\u20131155v.MING DAIMERRICK B. GARLAND, ATTORNEY GENERAL,\nPETITIONER19\u20131156v.CESAR ALCARAZ-ENRIQUEZon writs of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the ninth circuit[June 1, 2021]Justice Gorsuch delivered the opinion of the\nCourt.The Ninth Circuit has long applied a special\nrule in immigration disputes. The rule provides that, in the\nabsence of an explicit adverse credibility determination by an\nimmigration judge or the Board of Immigration Appeals, a reviewing\ncourt must treat a petitioning alien\u2019s testimony as credible and\ntrue. At least 12 members of the Ninth Circuit have objected to\nthis judge-made rule, and we granted certiorari to decide whether\nit can be squared with the terms of the Immigration and Nationality\nAct (INA), 66Stat. 163, as amended, 8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71101etseq.IAThe question comes to us in cases involving\nCesar Alcaraz-Enriquez and Ming Dai. Mr. Alcaraz-Enriquez is a\nMexican national. Authorities detained him when he attempted to\nenter this country illegally. In proceedings before an immigration\njudge (IJ), Mr. Alcaraz-Enriquez sought to avoid being returned to\nMexico on the ground that his life or freedom would be threatened\nthere. See 8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71231(b)(3)(A). But Congress has\nsaid this form of relief from removal is unavailable if, among\nother things, \u201cthe Attorney General decides that .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nthe alien, having been convicted by a final judgment of a\nparticularly serious crime[,] is a danger to the community of the\nUnited States.\u201d \u00a71231(b)(3)(B)(ii). This proviso posed a problem\nfor Mr. Alcaraz-Enriquez because, during a previous illegal entry,\nhe pleadednolocontendereto \u201cinflict[ing] corporal\ninjury [on a] spouse [or] cohabitant\u201d under California law and\nreceived a 2-year sentence. Cal. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7273.5(A) (West\n2014).The key question thus became whether Mr.\nAlcaraz- Enriquez\u2019s California conviction amounted to \u201ca\nparticularly serious crime.\u201d The parties appear to agree that the\nanswer to that question turns on which version of events one\naccepts: The version found in a probation report issued at the time\nof Mr. Alcaraz-Enriquez\u2019s conviction, or the version he testified\nto years later as part of his removal proceeding. The IJ received\nand considered both.The probation report indicated that Mr. Alcaraz-\nEnriquez locked his 17-year-old girlfriend in his bedroom one\nevening, caught her trying to escape, dragged her back into the\nroom, threatened to stab her and dump her body in a dumpster, and\nforced her to have sex with him. The next morning, he beat the\nyoung woman, leaving bruises on her back, neck, arms, and\nlegs\u2014stopping only when she begged for her life. Later that\nevening, when she asked to leave, he dragged her out, threw her\nagainst the stairs, and kicked her as she rolled down. Her ordeal\nlasted nearly 24 hours. Police arrested Mr. Alcaraz-Enriquez days\nlater as he tried to flee his residence. At that time, Mr.\nAlcaraz-Enriquez admitted to the officers that he chased, grabbed,\nand punched his girlfriend in the face. He also admitted that he\nprevented her from leaving the house. But he claimed that he didn\u2019t\nhit her \u201cthat hard.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 19\u20131156, p.\n14a.Against this evidence, the IJ considered Mr.\nAlcaraz-Enriquez\u2019s testimony during his immigration proceeding.\nThere, he \u201cadmitted hitting his girlfriend, but not in the manner\nas described in the report.\u201dIbid.Mr. Alcaraz-Enriquez\ntestified that he was upset with his girlfriend because \u201che\nbelieved that [she] was hitting his daughter.\u201dIbid.In Mr.\nAlcaraz-Enriquez\u2019s view, he was coming to his daughter\u2019s defense.\nMr. Alcaraz-Enriquez denied dragging or kicking the young woman, or\nforcing her to have sex with him. He also submitted a letter from\nhis mother, who stated that when she saw the girlfriend immediately\nafter the altercation, \u201cshe looked completely fine.\u201d App. 256.Ultimately, the IJ held Mr. Alcaraz-Enriquez\nineligible for relief, relying in part on the version of events in\nthe probation report. Among other things, the IJ found it\nsignificant that there was \u201cno mention\u201d in the contemporaneous\nprobation report of the girlfriend hitting Mr. Alcaraz- Enriquez\u2019s\ndaughter. App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 19\u20131156, at 14a. On appeal,\nthe Bureau of Immigration Appeals (BIA) \u201cadopt[ed] and affirm[ed]\u201d\nthe IJ\u2019s decision.Id.,at 7a. The BIA held that the IJ had\n\u201cproperly considered all evidence of record,\u201d \u201cweighing and\ncomparing [Mr. Alcaraz-Enriquez\u2019s] testimony at the hearing and the\nprobation officer\u2019s report.\u201dId.,at 8a. The BIA also\nstressed its view that the IJ was not required to credit Mr.\nAlcaraz-Enriquez\u2019s \u201cversion of events over other plausible\nalternatives.\u201dIbid.The Ninth Circuit saw the matter differently.\nApplying circuit precedent, it held that \u201c\u00a0\u2018[w]here the BIA\ndoes not make an explicit adverse credibility finding, [the court]\nmust assume that [the alien\u2019s] factual contentions are\ntrue.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAlcaraz-Enriquezv.Sessions, 727 Fed.\nAppx. 260, 261 (2018). And because this rule required taking Mr.\nAlcaraz-Enriquez\u2019s testimony as true\u2014even in the face of competing\nevidence\u2014the Ninth Circuit held that the BIA erred in denying\nrelief and granted the petition for review.[1]BMing Dai is a Chinese national who came to the\nUnited States on a tourist visa. Shortly after arriving, he sought\nasylum. To win relief, Mr. Dai bore the burden of proving that he\nwas a \u201crefugee\u201d\u2014someone \u201cunable or unwilling\u201d to return to China\n\u201cbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. for failure or refusal to undergo [involuntary\nsterilization] or for other resistance to a coercive population\ncontrol program.\u201d 8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a71158(b)(1), 1101(a)(42).\nAs in Mr. Alcaraz-Enriquez\u2019s case, the parties have proceeded on\nthe assumption that everything here turns on questions of\nfact\u2014whether Mr. Dai was persecuted in the past or fears\npersecution in the future\u2014and we do the same.[2]Once more, the evidence before the IJ cut both\nways. On the one hand, Mr. Dai claimed that, after his wife became\npregnant with their second child in 2009, family-planning officials\nabducted her and forced her to have an abortion. Mr. Dai further\ntestified that, when he tried to stop his wife\u2019s abduction, police\nbroke his ribs, dislocated his shoulder, and jailed him for 10\ndays. According to Mr. Dai, he lost his job, his wife was demoted,\nand his daughter was denied admission to superior schools. In\napplying for asylum, Mr. Dai stated, \u201cI eventually found a way to\nreach the USA,\u201d and asked the government to \u201c[p]lease grant me\nasylum so that I can bring my wife and daughter to safety in the\nUSA.\u201d App. 155.On the other hand, Mr. Dai failed to disclose\nthe fact that his wife and daughter had already traveled to the\nUnited States\u2014andvoluntarily returned to China. The IJ\nobserved that Mr. Dai \u201chesitated at some length\u201d when confronted\nwith these facts. App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 19\u20131155, p. 170a.\nAfter being asked to tell the \u201creal story,\u201d Mr. Dai proceeded to\nadmit that his daughter returned to China to go to school; that his\nwife chose to return to her job and her elderly father; that Mr.\nDai did not have a job in China; and this was \u201cwhy he stayed\u201d in\nthe United States.Id.,at 171a. Asked directly why he did\nnot return to China with his family, Mr. Dai responded, \u201c[b]ecause\nat that time, I was in a bad mood and I couldn\u2019t get a job, so I\nwant to stay here for a bit longer and another friend of mine is\nalso here.\u201d App. 103.The IJ denied relief. In the IJ\u2019s view, the\n\u201cprincipal area of concern\u201d arose when Mr. Dai was confronted with\nhis wife and daughter\u2019s trip to the United States and their\nvoluntary return to China. App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 19\u20131155,\nat 169a. The record showed that Mr. Dai failed \u201cto disclose\u201d these\nfacts in his own statements, and that he \u201cpaused at length\u201d when\nconfronted with them.Id.,at 163a, 173a. The IJ concluded\nthat \u201cI do not find that [Mr. Dai\u2019s] explanations for [his wife\u2019s]\nreturn to China while he remained here are adequate.\u201dId.,at 175a. In the IJ\u2019s view, Mr. Dai\u2019s eventual admissions regarding\nhis wife and daughter\u2019s return to China to pursue school and\neconomic opportunities undermined his claims of past and future\npersecution, particularly given that his wife was \u201cthe primary\nobject of the persecution in China.\u201dIbid.On appeal, the\nBIA \u201cadopt[ed] and affirm[ed]\u201d the IJ\u2019s decision.Id.,at\n163a.Again, the Ninth Circuit saw things differently.\nMuch as it had inAlcaraz-Enriquez, a divided panel held\nthat \u201cin the absence of an explicit adverse credibility finding by\nthe IJ or the BIA,\u201d Mr. Dai\u2019s testimony had to be \u201cdeemed\u201d credible\nand true.Ming Daiv.Sessions, 884 F.3d 858, 868\n(2018). On the strength of that testimony, the court then proceeded\nto find Mr. Dai eligible for asylum. Later, the court of appeals\ndenied the government\u2019s petition for rehearing en banc over the\nobjections of 12 judges.IIAFor many years, and over many dissents, the\nNinth Circuit has proceeded on the view that, \u201c[i]n the absence of\nan explicit adverse credibility finding [by the agency], we must\nassume that [the alien\u2019s] factual contentions are true\u201d or at least\ncredible.E.g.,Katariav.INS,232 F.3d 1107, 1114 (2000);ZhiqiangHuv.Holder, 652 F.3d 1011 (2011); 884 F.\u00a03d, at 868; 727\nFed. Appx., at 261. This view appears to be an outlier. The First\nCircuit, for example, has held that a reviewing court is not bound\nto accept a witness\u2019s statements as fact whenever the agency is\nless than explicit about credibility.Wan Chien Khov.Keisler, 505 F.3d 50, 56 (2007).In both of the cases before us, the Ninth\nCircuit rested its decisions on its deemed-true-or-credible rule.\nInAlcaraz-Enriquez, the Ninth Circuit applied the rule to\ndisregard entirely the evidence contained in the probation report\nand credit only Mr. Alcaraz-Enriquez\u2019s version of events. 727 Fed.\nAppx., at 261. InDai, the court deemed Mr. Dai\u2019sfavorabletestimony credible and true and prohibited theunfavorabletestimony about his \u201creal\u201d reasons for remaining\nin the country from being \u201csmuggled\u201d into the removal analysis. 884\nF.\u00a03d, at 872. As one of the dissents inDaiput it,\nthe Ninth Circuit\u2019s rule leads to \u201cthe extraordinary position\u201d that\na court \u201cmust take as true an asylum applicant\u2019s testimony that\nsupports a claim for asylum, even in the face of other testimony\nfrom the applicant that would undermine an asylum claim.\u201dMingDaiv.Barr, 940 F.3d 1143, 1149 (2019)\n(opinion of Callahan, J.).The Ninth Circuit\u2019s rule has no proper place in\na reviewing court\u2019s analysis. Congress has carefully circumscribed\njudicial review of BIA decisions. When it comes to questions of\nfact\u2014such as the circumstances surrounding Mr. Alcaraz-Enriquez\u2019s\nprior conviction or Mr. Dai\u2019s alleged persecution\u2014the INA provides\nthat a reviewing court must accept \u201cadministrative findings\u201d as\n\u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to\nconclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7\u00a01252(b)(4)(B). This is a \u201chighly deferential\u201d standard.Nasrallahv.Barr, 590 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2020)\n(slip op., at 9); cf.INSv.Elias-Zacarias,502 U.S.\n478, 483\u2013484 (1992). Nothing in the INA contemplates any- thing\nlike the embellishment the Ninth Circuit has adopted. And it is\nlong since settled that a reviewing court is \u201cgenerally not free to\nimpose\u201d additional judge-made procedural requirements on agencies\nthat Congress has not prescribed and the Constitution does not\ncompel.Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp.v.Natural\nResources Defense Council, Inc.,435 U.S.\n519, 524 (1978).This does not mean that the BIA may\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018arbitrarily\u2019\u00a0\u201d reject an alien\u2019s evidence.Director, Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programsv.Greenwich Collieries,512 U.S.\n267, 279 (1994). But it does mean that, so long as the record\ncontains \u201c\u00a0\u2018contrary evidence\u2019\u00a0\u201d of a \u201c\u00a0\u2018kind and\nquality\u2019\u00a0\u201d that a reasonable factfinder could find sufficient,\na reviewing court may not overturn the agency\u2019s factual\ndetermination.Ibid. In this process, a reviewing court must\nbe mindful too that the agency, like any reasonable factfinder, is\nfree to \u201ccredit part of [a] witness\u2019 testimony without\u201d necessarily\n\u201caccepting it all.\u201dBanksv.Chicago Grain Trimmers\nAssn., Inc.,390 U.S.\n459, 467 (1968). It does not matter whether the agency accepts\nall, none, or some of the alien\u2019s testimony; its reasonable\nfindings may not be disturbed.Admittedly, there is a wrinkle. Elsewhere, the\nINAdoesdiscuss a presumption of credibility. The statute\nprovides that absent an \u201cexplici[t]\u201d \u201cadverse credibility\ndetermination,\u201d \u201cthe applicant or witness shall have a rebuttable\npresumption of credibility on appeal.\u201d \u00a7\u00a71158(b)(1)(B)(iii),\n1231(b)(3)(C), 1229a(c)(4)(C). At the same time, the statute\ncautions that outside the \u201cappeal\u201d there is \u201cnopresumption\nof credibility.\u201dIbid.(emphasis added).It\u2019s easy to see how one might assume judicial\nproceedings in cases like ours constitute \u201cappeals\u201d subject to this\npresumption of credibility. But such an assumption would be\nmistaken. As the Ninth Circuit itself has recognized, in\nimmigration cases like those before us, there is only one\n\u201cappeal\u201d\u2014from the IJ to the BIA. 884 F.\u00a03d, at 869; see alsoKho, 505 F.\u00a03d, at 56; \u00a7\u00a71158(d)(5)(A)(iii)\u2013(iv); 8 CFR\n\u00a71003.38 (2020). Under the INA, subsequent judicial review takes\nplace by means of a \u201cpetition for review.\u201d 8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7\u00a71252(a)(5), (b); cf. 5 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a7702\u2013703. It is true\nthat, at one point, the INA refers to dismissing \u201cthe appeal\u201d if an\nalien fails to file a timely brief in support of his petition for\nreview, 8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71252(b)(3)(C), but that stray\nreference does not convert the statutorily described petition for\nreview proceeding into an appeal for purposes of the presumption of\ncredibility.Historical understandings confirm the point.\nArticle III courts do not traditionally hear direct appeals from\nArticle II executive agencies. See,e.g.,Ex parte\nYerger, 8 Wall. 85 (1869);FCCv.Pottsville\nBroadcasting Co.,309 U.S.\n134, 144 (1940). Instead, judicial intervention generally\ncomes, if at all, thanks to some collateral review process Congress\nhas prescribed, initiating a new action in the federal courts. See,e.g.,5 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a7702\u2013703 (authorizing parties to\nchallenge agency action not by an appeal, but by \u201c[a]n action in a\ncourt of the United States\u201d in which the \u201cUnited States may be\nnamed as a defendant\u201d). Of course, Congress may sometimes refer to\ncollateral judicial review of executive action as \u201can appeal,\u201d see,e.g.,35 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7141; Fed. Rule App.\nProc.\u00a015, but that does not make it an \u201cappeal\u201d akin to that\ntaken from the district court to the court of appeals, or from the\nIJ to the BIA. In any event, this is an easy case because the INA\nprovides that \u201ca petition for review .\u00a0.\u00a0. shall be the\nsole and exclusive means for judicial review of an order of\nremoval.\u201d 8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71252(a)(5).That the presumption of credibility applies only\n\u201con appeal\u201d to the BIA makes sense as a matter of basic\nadministrative law principles too. Reviewing courts have no need\nfor a presumption of credibility one way or the other because they\ndo not make credibility determinations. Instead, courts\ndeferentially review theagency\u2019sfact\ndeterminations. See \u00a71252(b)(4)(B); see also 5 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7706(2)(E). The IJ\u2014who actually observes the witness\u2014is best\npositioned to assess the applicant\u2019s credibility in the first\ninstance. The credibility presumption encourages the IJ to make\nspecific findings about credibility. And then the BIA\u2014which has\nexperience with the sort of facts that recur in immigration cases\nand the ability to directly override the IJ\u2019s factfindings\u2014is well\npositioned to apply the credibility presumption if the IJ has not\nmade an explicit finding.All of which returns us to where we began. A\npresumption of credibility may arise in some appeals before the\nBIA. But no such presumption applies in antecedent proceedings\nbefore an IJ, or in subsequent collateral review before a federal\ncourt. The only question for judges reviewing the BIA\u2019s factual\ndeterminations is whetheranyreasonable adjudicator could\nhave found as the agency did. The Ninth Circuit\u2019s rule mistakenly\nflips this standard on its head. Rather than ask whether the\nagency\u2019s finding qualifies as one of potentially many reasonable\npossibilities, it gives conclusive weight to any piece of testimony\nthat cuts against the agency\u2019s finding. That was error.BPerhaps recognizing the problems with the\nNinth Circuit\u2019s rule, Mr. Alcaraz-Enriquez and Mr. Dai ask us to\naffirm that court\u2019s judgments primarily by means of a different,\nthough closely related, chain of reasoning. The argument goes like\nthis: Because neither the IJ nor the BIA made an explicit adverse\ncredibility determination about their testimony, Mr.\nAlcaraz-Enriquez and Mr. Dai say they were statutorily entitled to\na presumption of credibility in their BIA appeals. And giventhat, they insist they are entitled to relief in court\nbecause no reasonable adjudicator obliged to presume their\ncredibility could have found against them. In this version of the\nargument, Mr. Alcaraz-Enriquez and Mr. Dai acknowledge the proper\nlocus of the presumption of credibility in the agency and the\ndeferential standard of review in collateral judicial proceedings.\nBut, they insist, they are entitled to relief all the same. In\nplaces, they also suggest that the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decisions below\ncan be read as endorsing their alternative theory.Although we leave the full application of the\n\u00a71252(b)(4)(B) standard to the Ninth Circuit in the first instance,\nwe reject this alternative argument for affirmance too. In\nexplaining why, we leave for another day the question what the\nfactfinder must say or do to furnish an \u201cexplici[t] adverse\ncredibility determination.\u201d Even assuming (without deciding) there\nwas no such determination here, the Ninth Circuit\u2019s reasoning was\nflawed. One can think about the reason why in either of two\nways.1Start with the fact that the INA\u2019s\n\u201cpresumption\u201d of credibility on appeal is \u201crebuttable.\u201d\nNecessarily, that means the presumption is not conclusive. Notably,\ntoo, unlike the requirement that any initial adverse credibility\ndetermination must be \u201cexplicitly made,\u201d the INA contains no\nparallel requirement of explicitness when it comes to rebutting the\npresumption on appeal. 8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a71158(b)(1)(B)(iii),\n1231(b)(3)(C), 1229a(c)(4)(C).Of course, reviewing courts remain bound by\ntraditional administrative law principles, including the rule that\njudges generally must assess the lawfulness of an agency\u2019s action\nin light of the explanations the agency offered for it rather than\nanyex postrationales a court can devise. See,e.g.,\nSECv.Chenery Corp.,318 U.S.\n80(1943). But none of that means the BIA must follow a\nparticular formula or incant \u201cmagic words\u201d like \u201cincredible\u201d or\n\u201crebutted\u201d to overcome the INA\u2019s presumption of credibility on\nappeal. Cf.INSv.Aguirre-Aguirre,526 U.S.\n415, 431\u2013432 (1999). To the contrary, a reviewing court must\n\u201cuphold\u201d even \u201ca decision of less than ideal clarity if the\nagency\u2019s path may reasonably be discerned.\u201dBowman Transp.,\nInc.v.Arkansas-Best Freight System, Inc.,419 U.S.\n281, 286 (1974); see also 5 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7701et\u00a0seq.So long as the BIA\u2019s reasons for rejecting an\nalien\u2019s credibility are reasonably discernible, the agency must be\nunderstood as having rebutted the presumption of credibility. It\nneed not use any particular words to do so. And, once more, a\nreviewing court must uphold that decision unless a reasonable\nadjudicator would have been compelled to reach a different\nconclusion. 8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a01252(b)(4)(B).In the cases before us, the Ninth Circuit did\nnot consider the possibility that the BIA implicitly found the\npresumption of credibility rebutted. In Mr. Alcaraz-Enriquez\u2019s\ncase, the court ignored whether the agency\u2019s statements could be\nfairly understood as rejecting his credibility. Concluding that the\nIJ properly \u201cweigh[ed] and compar[ed]\u201d the probation report and Mr.\nAlcaraz-Enriquez\u2019s hearing testimony, the BIA cited precedent about\nhow an IJ is \u201cnot required to adopt\u201d an applicant\u2019s denial of\nculpability. See App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 19\u20131156, at 8a;Matter of D\u2013R\u2013, 25 I.\u00a0&\u00a0N. Dec. 445, 455 (BIA\n2011) (\u201cThe [IJ] was not required to credit the respondent\u2019s\nwholesale denial of any knowledge or culpability\u201d). The BIA also\nexpressly adopted the IJ\u2019s decision. The IJ decision, in turn,\nnoted that Mr. Alcaraz-Enriquez\u2019s story changed from the time of\nthe probation report to the time of the hearing, a factor the\nstatute specifically identifies as relevant to credibility. See\n\u00a7\u00a71158(b)(1)(B)(iii), 1231(b)(3)(C), 1229a(c)(4)(C). The IJ further\nconcluded that Mr. Alcaraz-Enriquez\u2019s testimony sought to minimize\nhis actions and condone violence against his girlfriend, suggesting\nthe IJ rejected his claim that he intervened only to defend his\ndaughter. On remand, the Ninth Circuit should consider whether the\nBIA in fact found the presumption of credibility overcome in this\ncase. If so, it seems unlikely that conclusion is one no reasonable\nadjudicator could have reached.The same might be said of Mr. Dai\u2019s case. The\nBIA specifically highlighted Mr. Dai\u2019s family \u201cvoluntarily\nreturning and his not being truthful about it\u201d as \u201cdetrimental to\nhis claim.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 19\u20131155, at 164a. And\nhere again the BIA adopted the IJ\u2019s decision, which discussed\nspecific problems with Mr. Dai\u2019s assertions about his past\npersecution and fear of future persecution\u2014including Mr. Dai\u2019s\nintentional failure to disclose highly probative and damaging\nfacts, his inadequate explanations for contradictions in his\npresentation, and his ultimate concessions about the \u201creal story.\u201d\nSuch a detailed analysis certainly goes to the presumption of\ncredibility, even if the agency did not utter the words \u201cadverse\ncredibility finding.\u201d The INA provides instructions about the\nappropriate considerations for making a credibility determination,\nincluding the witness\u2019s demeanor, candor, and internal\ninconsistency in his testimony. See \u00a7\u00a71158(b)(1)(B)(iii),\n1231(b)(3)(C), 1229a(c)(4)(C). It is thus unsurprising\u2014and in fact\nquite helpful for later review\u2014that the IJ addressed many of those\nquestions at length. By adopting that analysis as its own, the\nBIA\u2019s decisional path here, too, includes that analysis. Once more,\nthe Ninth Circuit should consider whether the BIA found that Mr.\nDai\u2019s presumption of credibility had been overcome. And, once more,\nit is hard to say that decision is one no reasonable adjudicator\ncould have reached.2There is, however, another problem with the\nNinth Circuit\u2019s reasoning in these cases. Not only is the\npresumption of credibility before the BIA rebuttable, it appliesonlywith respect to credibility. \u00a7\u00a71158(b)(1)(B)(iii),\n1231(b)(3)(C), 1229a(c)(4)(C). This matters because, when it comes\nto the forms of relief Mr. Alcaraz-Enriquez and Mr. Dai sought, the\nINA expressly distinguishes between credibility, persuasiveness,\nand the burden of proof. See \u00a7\u00a71158(b)(1)(B)(ii), 1231(b)(3)(C),\n1229a(c)(4)(B). In order for an alien\u2019s testimony to carry the day\non its own, the statute requires the alien to satisfy the trier of\nfact on all three counts\u2014showing his \u201ctestimony is credible, is\npersuasive, and refers to specific facts sufficient to demonstrate\nthat the applicant is a refugee.\u201dIbid.When determining\nwhether an alien has met his burden of proof, the INA further\nprovides that the agency may weigh \u201cthe credible testimony along\nwith other evidence of record.\u201dIbid.Accordingly, even if\nthe BIA treats an alien\u2019s evidence as credible, the agency need not\nfind his evidence persuasive or sufficient to meet the burden of\nproof. See,e.g.,Doev.Holder, 651 F.3d 824,\n830 (CA8 2011);Gutierrez-Orcozov.Lynch, 810 F.3d\n1243, 1246 (CA10 2016).Admittedly, credibility and persuasiveness are\nclosely bound concepts, sometimes treated interchangeably, and the\nline between them doesn\u2019t have to be drawn the same way in every\nlegal context. But the distinctions the INA draws aren\u2019t entirely\nunfamiliar either. Take an example. Suppose a plaintiff is doing\nher best to recount a car accident to prove her case for damages.\nShe testifies earnestly that she thought the traffic light was\ngreen when she entered an intersection. The plaintiff says she was\nthen broadsided by the defendant who was traveling on a cross\nstreet and ran a red light. Later in the proceedings, however, the\ndefendant presents video footage and the testimony of other\nwitnesses, all of which show that it was really the plaintiff who\ndrove through a red light and the defendant who had the right of\nway. It\u2019s easy enough to imagine that a factfinder might not\ndescribe the plaintiff as lacking credibility\u2014in the sense that she\nwas lying or not \u201cworthy of belief,\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 448\n(10th ed. 2014) (defining \u201ccredibility\u201d)\u2014yet find that her\ntestimony on a key fact was outweighed by other evidence and thus\nunpersuasive or insufficient to prove the defendant\u2019s liability.\nIt\u2019s not always the case that credibility equals factual accuracy,\nnor does it guarantee a legal victory.The Ninth Circuit erred by treating credibility\nas dispositive of both persuasiveness and legal sufficiency in\nthese cases. Even setting aside thecredibilityof Mr.\nAlcaraz-Enriquez or Mr. Dai, perhaps the BIA did not find their\nevidencepersuasiveor sufficient to meet their burden on\nessential questions. In Mr. Alcaraz-Enriquez\u2019s case, the probation\nreport may have outweighed his testimony. Similarly, in Mr. Dai\u2019s\ncase, his later admissions about his family\u2019s voluntary return and\nhis decision to stay in this country for economic reasons may have\noutweighed his initial testimony about his past and feared future\npersecution. Faced with conflicting evidence, it seems likely that\na reasonable adjudicator could find the unfavorable account more\npersuasive than the favorable version in both cases.*The Ninth Circuit\u2019s deemed-true-or-credible\nrule cannot be reconciled with the INA\u2019s terms. Instead,\nimmigration cases like these should proceed as follows. First, the\nfactfinder\u2014here the IJ\u2014makes findings of fact, including\ndeterminations as to the credibility of particular witness\ntestimony. The BIA then reviews those findings, applying a\npresumption of credibility if the IJ did not make an explicit\nadverse credibility determination. Finally, the court of appeals\nmust accept the agency\u2019s findings of fact as \u201cconclusive unless any\nreasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the\ncontrary.\u201dNor can we affirm the Ninth Circuit\u2019s judgments\non alternative grounds. The Ninth Circuit failed to consider that\nthe BIA may have implicitly rebutted the presumption of\ncredibility. The Ninth Circuit also erroneously allowed credibility\nto operate as a trump card, foreclosing the possibility that even\ncredible testimony may be outweighed by other more persuasive\nevidence or be insufficient to satisfy the burden of proof.\nAccordingly, the judgments of the Court of Appeals are vacated, and\nthese cases are remanded for further proceedings consistent with\nthis opinion.It is so ordered.Notes1Separately, the Ninth\nCircuit held that the BIA erred by failing to give Mr.\nAlcaraz-Enriquez the opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses\nwhose testimony was embodied in the probation report. In their\nbriefing before us, the parties largely proceed on the assumption\nthat the report was properly received, and so do we. Remaining\ndisputes over the merits and potential forfeiture of this issue can\nbe addressed on remand.2Mr. Dai also sought\nwithholding of removal, for which he needed to show that his \u201clife\nor freedom would be threatened\u201d in China \u201cbecause of [his] race,\nreligion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or\npolitical opinion.\u201d 8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71231(b)(3)(A). Both the\nBIA and the Ninth Circuit treated this standard as a more-demanding\nversion of the showing needed for asylum. See App. to Pet. for\nCert. in No. 19\u20131155, p. 164a;MingDaiv.Sessions, 884 F.3d 858, 874 (2018). None of the parties\ndisputes this framing, so we focus on the asylum claim\nalone.",
