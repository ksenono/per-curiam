BANK N.\u00a0A., et\u00a0al.on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the eighth circuit[June 1, 2020]Justice Sotomayor, with whom Justice Ginsburg,\nJustice Breyer, and Justice Kagan join, dissenting.The Court holds that the Constitution prevents\nmillions of pensioners from enforcing their rights to prudent and\nloyal management of their retirement trusts. Indeed, the Court\ndetermines that pensioners may not bring a federal lawsuit to stop\nor cure retirement-plan mismanagement until their pensions are on\nthe verge of default. This conclusion conflicts with common sense\nand longstanding precedent.IAERISA[1]\nprotects \u201cthe interests of participants in employee benefit plans\nand their beneficiaries.\u201d 29 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71001(b). Chief\namong these safeguards is that \u201call assets of an employee benefit\nplan\u201d must \u201cbe held in trust by one or more trustees\u201d for \u201cthe\nexclusive purposes of providing benefits to participants in the\nplan and their beneficiaries.\u201d \u00a7\u00a71103(a), (c)(1). A retirement\nplan\u2019s assets \u201cshall never inure to the benefit of any employer.\u201d\n\u00a71103(c)(1).Because ERISA requires that retirement-plan\nassets be held in trust, it imposes on the trustees and other plan\nmanagers \u201c\u00a0\u2018strict standards\u2019\u00a0\u201d of conduct\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018derived from the common law of trusts.\u2019\u00a0\u201dFifth\nThird Bancorpv.Dudenhoeffer,573\nU.S. 409, 416 (2014) (quotingCentral States, Southeast\n& Southwest Areas Pension Fundv.Central Transport,\nInc.,472 U.S.\n559, 570 (1985)). These \u201cfiduciary duties\u201d obligate the\ntrustees and managers to act prudently and loyally, looking out\nsolely for the best interest of the plan\u2019s participants and\nbeneficiaries\u2014typically, the employees who sacrifice wages today to\nsecure their retirements tomorrow. \u00a7\u00a71104, 1106. Not surprisingly,\nERISA fiduciaries owe duties not only to the plan they manage, but\nalso \u201cto the beneficiaries\u201d and participants for whom they manage\nit.Harris Trust and Sav. Bankv.Salomon Smith Barney\nInc.,530 U.S.\n238, 241\u2013242, 250 (2000).If a fiduciary flouts these stringent standards,\nERISA provides a cause of action and makes the fiduciary personally\nliable. \u00a7\u00a71109, 1132. The United States Secretary of Labor, a plan\nparticipant or beneficiary, or another fiduciary may sue for\n\u201cappropriate relief under section 1109.\u201d \u00a71132(a)(2); see also\n\u00a71132(a)(3) (permitting participants, beneficiaries, or fiduciaries\nto bring suit \u201cto enjoin any act or practice which violates any\nprovision of this subchapter or the terms of the plan\u201d). Section\n1109\u2019s remedies include restoration of lost assets, disgorgement of\nill-gained profits, and removal of the offending fiduciaries.\n\u00a71109(a).BPetitioners allege that, as of 2007,\nrespondents breached their fiduciary duty of loyalty by investing\npension-plan assets in respondents\u2019 own mutual funds and by paying\nthemselves excessive management fees. (Petitioners further contend\nthat this self-dealing persists today.) According to the complaint,\nthe fiduciaries also made imprudent investments that allowed them\nto manipulate accounting rules, boost their reported incomes,\ninflate their stock prices, and exercise lucrative stock options to\ntheir own (and their shareholders\u2019) benefit.Then came the Great Recession. In 2008, the\nretirement plan lost $1.1 billion, allegedly $748 million more than\na properly managed plan would have lost. So some of the plan\u2019s\nparticipants sued under 29 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71132(a) for the\nrelief Congress contemplated: restoration of losses, disgorgement\nof respondents\u2019 ill-gotten profits and fees, removal of the\ndisloyal fiduciaries, and an injunction to stop the ongoing\nbreaches. Faced with this lawsuit, respondents returned to the plan\nabout $311 million (less than half of what the plan had lost) and\nnone of the profits respondents had unlawfully gained. See 873 F.3d\n617, 630\u2013631 (CA8 2018).IIIn the Court\u2019s words, the question here is\nwhether petitioners have alleged a \u201cconcrete\u201d injury to support\ntheir constitutional standing to sue.Ante, at 3. They have\nfor at least three independent reasons.AFirst, petitioners have an interest in their\nretirement plan\u2019s financial integrity, exactly like private trust\nbeneficiaries have in protecting their trust. By alleging a $750\nmillion injury to that interest, petitioners have established their\nstanding.1This Court typically recognizes an \u201cinjury in\nfact\u201d where the alleged harm \u201chas a close relationship to\u201d one\n\u201cthat has traditionally been regarded as providing a basis for a\nlawsuit in English or American courts.\u201dSpokeo, Inc.v.Robins, 578 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 9).\nThus, the Court acknowledges that \u201cprivate trust\u201d beneficiaries\nhave standing to protect the assets in which they have an\n\u201cequitable\u201d interest.Ante, at 3\u20134. The critical question,\nthen, is whether petitioners have an equitable interest in their\nretirement plan\u2019s assets even though their pension payments are\nfixed.They do. ERISA expressly required the creation\nof a trust in which petitioners are the beneficiaries: \u201c[A]ll\nassets\u201d of the plan \u201cshall be held in trust\u201d for petitioners\u2019\n\u201cexclusive\u201d benefit. 29 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a71103(a), (c)(1); see\nalso \u00a71104(a)(1).[2] These\nrequirements exist regardless whether the employer establishes a\ndefined-benefit or defined-contribution plan. \u00a71101(a). Similarly,\nthe Plan Document governing petitioners\u2019 defined-benefit plan\nstates that, at \u201c\u00a0\u2018all times,\u2019\u00a0\u201d all plan assets\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018shall\u2019\u00a0\u201d be in a \u201c\u00a0\u2018trust fund\u2019\u00a0\u201d managed\nfor the participants\u2019 and beneficiaries\u2019 \u201c\u00a0\u2018exclusive\nbenefit.\u2019\u00a0\u201d App. 60\u201361. The Plan Document also gives\npetitioners a residual interest in the trust fund\u2019s assets: It\ninstructs that, \u201c[u]pon termination of the Plan, each Participant\n[and] Beneficiary\u201d shall look to \u201cthe assets of the [trust\nf\u00a0]und\u201d to \u201cprovide the benefits otherwise apparently promised\nin this Plan.\u201d Record in No. 13\u2013cv\u20132687 (D Minn.), Doc. 107\u20131,\np.\u00a075. This arrangement confers on the \u201cparticipants [and]\nbeneficiaries\u201d of a defined-benefit plan an equitable stake, or a\n\u201ccommon interest,\u201d in \u201cthe financial integrity of the plan.\u201dMassachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co.v.Russell,473 U.S.\n134, 142, n.\u00a09 (1985).Petitioners\u2019 equitable interest finds ample\nsupport in traditional trust law. \u201cThe creation of a trust,\u201d like\nthe one here, provides beneficiaries \u201can equitable interest in the\nsubject matter of the trust.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Trusts \u00a774,\nCommenta, p.\u00a0192 (1957); seeBlairv.Commissioner,300 U.S.\n5, 13 (1937). Courts have long recognized that this equitable\ninterest gives beneficiaries a basis to \u201chave a breach of trust\nenjoined and .\u00a0.\u00a0. redress[ed].\u201dIbid.; see alsoSpokeo, 578 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 9). That is, a\nbeneficiary\u2019s equitable interest allows her to \u201cmaintain a suit\u201d to\n\u201ccompel the trustee to perform his duties,\u201d to \u201cenjoin the trustee\nfrom committing a breach of trust,\u201d to \u201ccompel the trustee to\nredress a breach of trust,\u201d and to \u201cremove the trustee.\u201d\nRestatement (Second) of Trusts \u00a7199; see alsoid., \u00a7205\n(beneficiary may require a trustee to restore \u201cany loss or\ndepreciation in value of the trust estate\u201d and \u201cany profit made by\n[the trustee] through the breach of trust\u201d).[3]So too here. Because respondents\u2019 alleged\nmismanagement lost the pension fund hundreds of millions of\ndollars, petitioners have stated an injury to their equitable\nproperty interest in that trust.2The Court, by contrast, holds that\nparticipants and beneficiaries in a defined-benefit plan have no\nstake in their plan\u2019s assets.Ante, at 4. In other words,\nthe Court treats beneficiaries as mere bystanders to their own\npensions.That is wrong on several scores. For starters,\nit creates a paradox: In one breath, the Court determines that\npetitioners have \u201cno equitable or property interest\u201d in their\nplan\u2019s assets,ante, at 4; in another, the Court concedes\nthat petitioners have an enforceable interest in receiving their\n\u201cmonthly pension benefits,\u201dante, at 2. Benefits paid from\nwhere? The plan\u2019s assets, obviously. Precisely because petitioners\nhave an interest in payments from their trust fund, they have an\ninterest in the integrity of the assets from which those payments\ncome. SeeRussell, 473 U.\u00a0S., at 142, n.\u00a09.The Court\u2019s contrary conclusion is\nunrecognizable in the fundamental trust law that both ERISA and the\nPlan Document expressly incorporated. If the participants and\nbeneficiaries in a defined-benefit plan did not have equitable\ntitle to the plan\u2019s assets, then no one would. Yet that would mean\nthat no \u201ctrust\u201d exists, contrary to the plain terms of both ERISA\nand the Plan Document. See 29 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71103(a); App. 60;\nsee also n.\u00a02,supra;Blair, 300 U.\u00a0S., at\n13; Bogert & Bogert \u00a71; Restatement (Second) of Trusts \u00a774,\nCommenta, at\u00a0192.Recognizing this problem, the Court asserts\nthat, despite our case law, ERISA\u2019s text, and petitioners\u2019 Plan\nDocument, trust law is not relevant at all. The Court announces\nthat all \u201cplaintiffs who allege mismanagement of a defined-benefit\nplan,\u201d regardless of their plan terms, cannot invoke a \u201ctrust-law\nanalogy\u201d to \u201csupport Article III standing.\u201dAnte, at 4.That categorical conclusion has no basis in\nlogic or law. Logically, the Court\u2019s reasoning relies on tautology.\nTo distinguish an ERISA trust fund from a private trust fund, the\nCourt observes that petitioners\u2019 payments have not \u201cfluctuate[d]\nwith the value of the plan or because of the plan fiduciaries\u2019 good\nor bad investment decisions\u201d in the past,ante,at 1, so\npetitioners will necessarily continue to receive full payments \u201cfor\nthe rest of their lives,\u201d no matter the outcome of this suit,ante, at 3. But that is circular: Petitioners will receive\nbenefits indefinitely because they receive benefits now? The Court\ndoes not explain how the pension could satisfy its monthly\nobligation if, as petitioners allege, the plan fiduciaries drain\nthe pool from which petitioners\u2019 fixed income streams flow.Legally, the Court\u2019s analysis lists distinctions\nwithout a difference. First, the Court writes that a trust\npromising fixed payments is not a trust because the promise \u201cwill\nnot change, regardless of how well or poorly the [trust] is\nmanaged.\u201dAnte,at 4. That does not follow (a promise of\npayment differs from an actual payment) and it does not disprove a\ntrust. Trusts vary in their terms, to be sure. See Bogert &\nBogert \u00a7181 (\u201cThe settlor has great freedom in the selection of the\nbeneficiaries and their interests\u201d). But regardless whether a trust\ncreates a \u201cpresent interest\u201d in \u201cimmediate enjoyment\u201d of the trust\nproperty or \u201ca future interest\u201d in \u201creceiv[ing] trust assets or\nbenefits at a later time,\u201d the beneficiary \u201calways\u201d has an\n\u201cequitable\u201d stake.Ibid.Second, the Court states that \u201cthe employer, not\nplan participants, receives any surplus left over after all of the\nbenefits are paid\u201d and \u201cthe employer, not plan participants, is on\nthe hook for plan shortfalls.\u201dAnte,at 4; see alsoante,at\u00a07 (noting that \u201cthe federal Pension Benefit\nGuaranty Corporation is required by law to pay\u201d some benefits if a\nplan fails). But that does not distinguish ERISA from standard\ntrust law, either. It does not matter that other parties besides\nbeneficiaries may have a residual stake in trust assets; a\nbeneficiary with a life-estate interest in payments from a trust\nstill has an equitable interest. See Bogert & Bogert \u00a7706. Even\nlife-beneficiaries may \u201crequir[e]\u201d the trustee \u201cto pay the trust\nthe amount necessary to place the trust account in the position in\nwhich it would have been, had the [trustee\u2019s fiduciary] duty been\nperformed.\u201dIbid.If anything, petitioners\u2019 equitable\ninterests are stronger than those of their common-law counterparts;\nthe Plan Document provides petitioners a residual interest in the\npension fund\u2019s assets even after the trust terminates. See Record\nin No. 13\u2013cv\u20132687, Doc. 107\u20131, at\u00a075.Nor is it relevant whether additional parties\n(including an insurance carrier) are \u201con the hook\u201d for plan\nshortfalls after a loss occurs. Cf.ante,at 4, 6, 7, 8, n.\n2. The Court appears to conclude that insurance (or other\nprotections to remedy trust losses) would deprive beneficiaries of\ntheir equitable interests in their trusts. Seeibid.But the\nCourt cites nothing supporting that proposition. To the contrary,\nit is well settled that beneficiaries retain equitable interests in\ntrust assets even when those assets are insured or replenished. See\nBogert & Bogert \u00a7599. Some States and trusts require that the\n\u201cproperty of a trust .\u00a0.\u00a0. be insured\u201d or similarly\nprotected; indeed, some jurisdictions impose on trustees a\nfiduciary \u201cduty to insure.\u201dIbid.(collecting authorities).\nNone of those authorities suggests that beneficiaries lose their\nequitable interests as a result, and none suggests that the law\nexcuses a fiduciary\u2019s malfeasance simply because other sources may\nhelp provide relief. The Court\u2019s opposing view\u2014that employer\nliability and insurance pardon a trustee\u2019s wrongdoing from a\nbeneficiary\u2019s suit\u2014has no support in law.Third, the Court draws a line between a trust\nand a contract,ante,at 4, but this too is insignificant\nhere. The Court declares that petitioners\u2019 pension plan \u201cis more in\nthe nature of a contract,\u201dibid.\u00b8 but then overlooks that\nthe so-called contract creates a trust. The Plan Document expressly\nrequires that petitioners\u2019 pension funds be held in a \u201ctrust\u201d\nexclusively for petitioners\u2019 benefit. App. 60\u201361. The Court\u2019s\nstatement that \u201cthe employer, not plan participants, receives any\nsurplus left over after all of the benefits are paid,\u201d cf.ante,at 4, actually proves that a trust exists. The reason\nthe employer does not receive any residual until \u201cafter all of the\nbenefits are paid,\u201dibid., is because the Plan Document\nprovides petitioners an enforceable residual interest, Record in\nNo. 13\u2013cv\u20132687, Doc. 107\u20131, at\u00a075. It is telling that the\nCourt does not cite, let alone analyze, the \u201ccontract\u201d governing\npetitioners\u2019 trust fund.Last, the Court cites inapposite case law. It\nasserts that \u201cthis Court has stated\u201d that \u201cplan participants\npossess no equitable or property interest in the plan.\u201dAnte, at 4 (citingHughes Aircraft Co.v.Jacobson,525 U.S.\n432(1999), andLaRuev.DeWolff, Boberg &\nAssociates, Inc.,552 U.S.\n248(2008)). But precedent has said no such thing. Quite the\nopposite:Russellexplained that defined-benefit-plan\nbeneficiaries have a \u201ccommon interest\u201d in the \u201cfinancial integrity\u201d\nof their defined-benefit plan. 473 U.\u00a0S., at 142,\nn.\u00a09.NeitherHughesnorLaRuesuggests\notherwise.Hughesexplained that a defined-benefit-plan\nbeneficiary does not have \u201ca claim to any particular asset that\ncomposes a part of the plan\u2019s general asset pool.\u201d 525 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 440. But that statement concerned whether the beneficiaries had\na legal right to extra payments after the plan\u2019s assets grew.Id., at 436\u2013437. Whether a beneficiary has a legal claim to\npayment when a plan gains money says nothing about whether a\nbeneficiary has an equitable interest to restore assets when a plan\nloses money.Hughes, in fact, invited a suit like\npetitioners\u2019: The Court suggested that the plaintiffs could have\nprevailed had they \u201callege[d] that [the employer] used any of the\nassets for a purpose other than to pay its obligations to the\nPlan\u2019s beneficiaries.\u201dId., at 442\u2013443. Equally telling is\nthatHughesresolved the beneficiaries\u2019 breach-of-fiduciary\nclaims on the merits without doubting whether the plaintiffs had\nstanding to assert them. Seeid., at 443\u2013446;Steel\nCo.v.Citizens for Better Environment,523 U.S.\n83, 94\u201395 (1998) (explaining this Court\u2019s independent duty to\nassure itself of Article III standing).LaRueis even less helpful to today\u2019s\nCourt. That case involved a defined-contribution plan, not a\ndefined-benefit plan. 552 U.\u00a0S., at 250. It was about\nremedies, not rights. Seeid.,at 256. And it stated that\nalthough \u201cindividual injuries\u201d may occur from ERISA plan\nmismanagement, the statutory provision at issue required that the\nremedy go to the plan.Ibid.(discussing 29\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71132(a)(2)).LaRuesaid nothing about\nstanding and nothing about ERISA\u2019s other statutory\nremedies.[4] In fact,LaRueconfirmed that ERISA beneficiaries like petitioners\nmay sue fiduciaries for \u201c\u00a0\u2018any profit which would have accrued\nto the [plan] if there had been no breach of trust,\u2019\u00a0\u201d 552\nU.\u00a0S., at 254, n.\u00a04, or where \u201cfiduciary breaches\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. impair the value of plan assets,\u201did., at\n256. Because petitioners bring those kinds of claims,LaRuesupports their standing.BSecond, petitioners have standing because a\nbreach of fiduciary duty is a cognizable injury, regardless whether\nthat breach caused financial harm or increased a risk of\nnonpayment.1A beneficiary has a concrete interest in a\nfiduciary\u2019s loyalty and prudence. For over a century, trust law has\nprovided that breach of \u201ca fiduciary or trust relation\u201d makes the\ntrustee \u201csuable in equity.\u201dClewsv.Jamieson,182 U.S.\n461, 480\u2013481 (1901). That is because beneficiaries have an\nenforceable \u201cright that the trustee shall perform the trust in\naccordance with the directions of the trust instrument and the\nrules of equity.\u201d Bogert & Bogert \u00a7861; see also Restatement\n(Second) of Trusts \u00a7199 (trust beneficiary may \u201cmaintain a suit\u201d\nfor breach of fiduciary duty).That interest is concrete regardless whether the\nbeneficiary suffers personal financial loss. A beneficiary may sue\na trustee for restitution or disgorgement, remedies that recognize\nthe relevant harm as the trustee\u2019s wrongful gain. Through\nrestitution law, trustees are \u201csubject to liability\u201d if they are\nunjustly enriched by a \u201c\u00a0\u2018violation of [a beneficiary]\u2019s\nlegally protected rights,\u2019\u00a0\u201d like a breach of fiduciary duty.\nRestatement (Third) of Restitution and Unjust Enrichment \u00a71, and\nCommenta, p.\u00a03 (2010). Similarly, disgorgement allows\na beneficiary to \u201cstri[p]\u201d the trustee of \u201ca wrongful gain.\u201dId., \u00a73, Commenta, at\u00a022. Our Court drew on\nthese principles almost 200 years ago when it stated that a\ntrustee\u2019s breach of loyalty supports a cause of action \u201cwithout any\nfurther inquiry\u201d into gain or loss to a trust or its beneficiaries.Michoudv.Girod, 4 How. 503, 553 (1846); see also,e.g.,id., at 556\u2013557 (noting this rule\u2019s roots in\n\u201cEnglish courts of chancery from an early day\u201d); see alsoMagruderv.Drury,235 U.S.\n106, 120 (1914) (under \u201cthe principles governing the duty of a\ntrustee,\u201d it \u201cmakes no difference that the [trust] estate was not a\nloser in the transaction\u201d); Bogert & Bogert \u00a7543 (similar). Put\nanother way, \u201ctraditional remedies\u201d like \u201cunjust enrichment\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. are not contingent on a plaintiff \u2019s allegation of\ndamages beyond the violation of his private legal right.\u201dSpokeo, 578 U.\u00a0S., at ___\u2013___ (Thomas, J., concurring)\n(slip op., at 2\u20133).Nor does it matter whether the beneficiaries\nreceive the remedy themselves. A beneficiary may require a trustee\nto \u201crestore\u201d assets directly \u201cto the trust fund.\u201d Bogert &\nBogert \u00a7861; see also Restatement (Second) of Trusts \u00a7205. In fact,\nbecause fiduciary duties are so paramount, the remedy need not\ninvolve money at all. A beneficiary may sue to \u201cenjoin the trustee\nfrom committing a breach of trust\u201d and to \u201cremove the trustee.\u201dId., \u00a7199.Congress built on this tradition by making plan\nfiduciaries expressly liable to restore to the plan wrongful\nprofits and any losses their breach caused, and by providing for\ninjunctive relief to stop the misconduct and remove the wrongdoers.\nSee 29 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a71109, 1132(a)(2), (3). In doing so,\nCongress rejected the Court\u2019s statement that a \u201ctrust-law analogy\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. does not\u201d apply to \u201cplaintiffs who allege\nmismanagement of a defined-benefit plan.\u201d Cf.ante,at 4. To\nthe contrary, ERISA imposes \u201ctrust-like fiduciary standards,\u201dVarity Corp.v.Howe,516\nU.S. 489, 497 (1996), to \u201c[r]espon[d] to deficiencies in prior\nlaw regulating [retirement] plan fiduciaries\u201d and to provide even\ngreater protections for defined-benefit-plan beneficiaries,Harris Trust, 530 U.\u00a0S., at 241\u2013242; see alsoSpokeo, 578 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 9) (historical\nand congressionally recognized injuries often support\nstanding).Given all that history and ERISA\u2019s text, this\nCourt itself has noted, in the defined-benefit-plan context, \u201cthat\nwhen a trustee\u201d breaches \u201chis fiduciary duty to the beneficiaries,\u201d\nthe \u201cbeneficiaries may then maintain an action for restitution\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. or disgorgement.\u201dHarris Trust, 530\nU.\u00a0S., at 250.Harris Trustconfirms that ERISA\nincorporated \u201c[t]he common law of trusts\u201d to allow\ndefined-benefit-plan beneficiaries to seek relief from fiduciary\nbreaches.Ibid.; see alsoid., at 241\u2013242 (noting\nthat certain ERISA provisions \u201csupplemen[t] the fiduciary\u2019s general\nduty of loyalty to the plan\u2019s beneficiaries\u201d).[5]2The Court offers no reply to all the\nhistorical and statutory evidence showing petitioners\u2019 concrete\ninterest in prudent and loyal fiduciaries.Instead, the Court insists again that\n\u201cparticipants in a defined-benefit plan are not similarly situated\nto the beneficiaries of a private trust,\u201dante,at 4, and\nthat the \u201ccomplaint did not plausibly and clearly claim that the\nalleged mismanagement of the plan substantially increased the risk\nthat the plan and the employer would fail and be unable to pay the\nplaintiffs\u2019 future pension benefits,\u201dante, at 7.The first observation is incorrect for the\nreasons stated above. But even were the Court correct that\npetitioners\u2019 rights do not sound in trust law, petitioners would\nstill have standing. The Court reasons that petitioners have an\nenforceable right to \u201cmonthly payments for the rest of their lives\u201d\nbecause their plan confers a \u201ccontractua[l] entitle[ment].\u201dAnte, at 2. Under that view, the plan also confers\ncontractual rights to loyal and prudent plan management. See App.\n60\u201361; 29 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a71104, 1109.Thus, for the same reason petitioners could\nbring suit if they did not receive payments from their plan, they\ncould bring suit if they did not receive loyalty and prudence from\ntheir fiduciaries. After all, it is well settled that breach of \u201ca\ncontract to act diligently and skil[l]fully\u201d provides a \u201cgroun[d]\nof action\u201d in federal court.Wilcoxv.Executors of\nPlummer, 4 Pet. 172, 181\u2013182 (1830). It is also undisputed that\n\u201c[a] breach of contract always creates a right of action,\u201d even\nwhen no financial \u201charm was caused.\u201d Restatement (First) of\nContracts \u00a7328, and Commenta, pp. 502\u2013503 (1932); see alsoSpokeo, 578 U.\u00a0S., at ___\u2013___ (Thomas, J., concurring)\n(slip op., at 2\u20133) (\u201c[C]ourts historically presumed that the\nplaintiff suffered ade factoinjury merely from having his\npersonal, legal rights invaded\u201d even without any \u201callegation of\ndamages\u201d). Petitioners would thus have standing even were they to\naccept the Court\u2019s flawed premise.The Court\u2019s second statement, that petitioners\nhave not alleged a substantial risk of missed payments,ante,at 7, is orthogonal to the issues at hand. A\nbreach-of-fiduciary-duty claim exists regardless of the\nbeneficiary\u2019s personal gain, loss, or recovery. In rejecting\npetitioners\u2019 standing and maintaining that \u201cthis suit would not\nchange [petitioners\u2019] monthly pension benefits,\u201dante, at 8,\nthe Court fails to distinguish the different rights on which\npension-plan beneficiaries may sue. They have a right not just to\ntheir pension benefits, but also to loyal and prudent fiduciaries.\nSeeWarthv.Seldin,422 U.S.\n490, 500 (1975) (the standing inquiry \u201cturns on the nature and\nsource of the claim asserted\u201d). Petitioners seek relief tailored to\nthe second category, including restitution, disgorgement, and\ninjunctive remedies. Cf.Great-West Life & Annuity Ins.\nCo.v.Knudson,534 U.S.\n204, 215\u2013216 (2002) (explaining the various historical bases\nfor ERISA\u2019s remedies). The Court does not even try to explain\nERISA\u2019s (or the Plan Document\u2019s) text imposing fiduciary duties,\nlet alone this Court\u2019s decision inHarris Trustsupporting\npetitioners\u2019 standing. And even though the Court briefly mentions\nthat petitioners seek \u201cinjunctive relief, including replacement of\nthe plan\u2019s fiduciaries,\u201dante,at 2, it offers no analysis\non that issue. Put differently, the Court denies petitioners\nstanding to sue without analyzing all their claims to relief.With its focus on fiscal harm, the Court seems\nto suggest that pecuniary injury is thesine qua nonof\nstanding. The Court emphasizes that petitioners themselves have not\n\u201csustained any monetary injury\u201d apart from their trust fund\u2019s\nlosses.Ante,at 2; see alsoante, at 4.But injury to a plaintiff\u00a0\u2019s wallet is not,\nand has never been, a prerequisite for standing. The Constitution\npermits federal courts to hear disputes over nonfinancial injuries\nlike the harms alleged here.Spokeo, 578 U.\u00a0S., at ___\n(slip op., at 9); see also,e.g.,id., at ___\u2013___\n(Thomas, J.,\u00a0concurring) (slip op., at 2\u20133);Tennessee\nElec. Power Co.v.TVA,306 U.S.\n118, 137\u2013138 (1939).[6] InHecklerv.Mathews,465 U.S.\n728(1984), for instance, this Court recognized a\nplaintiff\u00a0\u2019s standing to assert a \u201cnoneconomic\u201d injury for\ndiscriminatory distribution of his Social Security benefits, even\nthough he did not have \u201ca substantive right to any particular\namount of benefits.\u201dId., at 737, 739. Petitioners\u2019 standing\nhere is even sturdier: They assert a noneconomic injury for\nunlawful management of their retirement plan and, unlike the\nplaintiff inHeckler, petitioners do have a substantive\nright to a particular amount of benefits. Cf.ante, at 2\n(acknowledging that petitioners\u2019 benefits are \u201cvested\u201d and that\npayments are \u201clegally and contractually\u201d required).None of this is disputed. In fact, the Court\nseems to concede all this reasoning in a footnote. Seeante,at 6, n.\u00a01. The Court appears to acknowledge that an ERISA\nbeneficiary\u2019s noneconomic right to information from the fiduciaries\nwould support standing. Seeibid.(citing 29\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71132(a)(1)(A)). Yet the Court offers no reason\nto think that a beneficiary\u2019s noneconomic right to loyalty and\nprudence from the fiduciaries is meaningfully different.For its part, the concurrence attempts to fill\nthe Court\u2019s gaps by adding that \u201c[t]he fiduciary duties created by\nERISA are owed to the plan, not petitioners.\u201dAnte, at 2\n(opinion of Thomas, J.). But this Court has already rejected that\nview. CompareVarity Corp., 516 U.\u00a0S., at 507 (\u201cThis\nargument fails\u201d), withid., at 516 (Thomas, J.,\ndissenting).Nor is that argument persuasive on its own\nterms. The concurrence relies on a compound prepositional phrase\ntaken out of context, collecting ERISA provisions saying that a\nfiduciary acts \u201cwith respect to\u201d a plan. Seeante, at 2\n(opinion of Thomas, J.). Of course a plan fiduciary performs her\nduties \u201cwith respect to a plan.\u201d 29 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71104(a)(1).\nAfter all, she manages the plan. \u00a71102(a). But she does so \u201csolely\nin the interest\u201d and \u201cfor the exclusive purposes\u201d of the plan\u2019s\n\u201cparticipants and beneficiaries.\u201d \u00a7\u00a71103(a), (c)(1),\n1104(a)(1).In short, the concurrence gets it backwards.\nCongress did not enact ERISA to protect plans as artificial\nentities. It enacted ERISA (and required trusts in the first place)\nto protect the plan \u201cparticipants\u201d and \u201ctheir beneficiaries.\u201d\n\u00a71001(b). Thus, ERISA fiduciary duties run where the statute says:\nto the participants and their beneficiaries.CLast, petitioners have standing to sue on\ntheir retirement plan\u2019s behalf.1Even if petitioners had no suable interest in\ntheir plan\u2019s financial integrity or its competent supervision, the\nplan itself would. There is no disputing at this stage that\nrespondents\u2019 \u201cmismanagement\u201d caused the plan \u201capproximately $750\nmillion in losses\u201d still not fully reimbursed.Ante, at 2\n(majority opinion). And even under the concurrence\u2019s view,\nrespondents\u2019 fiduciary duties \u201care owed to the plan.\u201dAnte,\nat 2 (opinion of Thomas, J.). The plan thus would have standing to\nsue under either theory discussed above.The problem is that the plan is a legal fiction:\nAlthough ERISA provides that a retirement plan \u201cmay sue\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. as an entity,\u201d 29 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71132(d)(1),\nsomeone must still do so on the plan\u2019s behalf. Typically that is\nthe fiduciary\u2019s job. See \u00a71102(a)(1) (fiduciaries have \u201cauthority\nto control and manage the operation and administration of the\nplan\u201d). But imagine a case like this one, where the fiduciaries\nrefuse to sue because they would be the defendants. Does the\nConstitution compel a pension plan to let a fox guard the\nhenhouse?Of course not. This Court\u2019s representational\nstanding doctrine permits petitioners to sue on their plan\u2019s\nbehalf. SeeFood and Commercial Workersv.Brown Group,\nInc.,517 U.S.\n544, 557 (1996). This doctrine \u201crests on the premise that in\ncertain circumstances, particular relationships (recognized either\nby common-law tradition or by statute) are sufficient to rebut the\nbackground presumption .\u00a0.\u00a0. that litigants may not\nassert the rights of absent third parties.\u201dIbid.(footnotes\nomitted). This is especially so where, as here, there is \u201csome sort\nof impediment\u201d to the other party\u2019s \u201ceffective assertion of their\nown rights.\u201d R. Fallon, J. Manning, D. Meltzer, & D. Shapiro,\nHart & Wechsler\u2019s The Federal Courts and the Federal System 158\n(6th ed. 2009); see alsoPowersv.Ohio,499 U.S.\n400, 410\u2013411 (1991).The common law has long regarded a beneficiary\u2019s\nrepresentational suit as a proper \u201cbasis for a lawsuit in English\nor American courts.\u201dSpokeo, 578 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 9). When \u201cthe trustee cannot or will not\u201d sue, a\nbeneficiary may do so \u201cas a temporary representative of the trust.\u201d\nBogert & Bogert \u00a7869. The common law also allows \u201cthe terms of\na trust\u201d to \u201cconfer upon others the power to enforce the trust,\u201d\ngiving that person \u201cstanding\u201d to \u201cbring suit against the trustee.\u201d\nRestatement (Third) of Trusts \u00a794, Commentd(1),\nat\u00a07.ERISA embraces this tradition. Sections\n1132(a)(2) and (a)(3) authorize participants and beneficiaries to\nsue \u201cin a representative capacity on behalf of the plan as a\nwhole,\u201dRussell, 473 U.\u00a0S., at 142, n.\u00a09, so that\nany \u201crecovery\u201d arising from the action \u201cinures to the benefit of\nthe plan as a whole,\u201did., at 140. Perhaps for this reason,\nand adding to the incongruity in today\u2019s outcome, some Members of\nthis Court have insisted that lawsuits to enforce ERISA\u2019s fiduciary\nduties \u201cmust\u201d be brought \u201cin a representative capacity.\u201dVarity\nCorp., 516 U.\u00a0S., at 516 (Thomas, J., dissenting)\n(internal quotation marks omitted).Permitting beneficiaries to enforce their plan\u2019s\nrights finds plenty of support in our constitutional case law. Take\nassociational standing: An association may file suit \u201cto redress\nits members\u2019 injuries, even without a showing of injury to the\nassociation itself.\u201dFood and Commercial Workers, 517\nU.\u00a0S., at 552. All Article III requires is that a member\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018would otherwise have standing to sue in their own\nright\u2019\u00a0\u201d and that \u201c\u00a0\u2018the interests [the association]\nseeks to protect are germane to the organization\u2019s purpose.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId., at 553. Petitioners\u2019 suit here is the other side of the\nsame coin: The plan would have standing to sue in its own right,\nand petitioners\u2019 interest is to disgorge wrongful profits and\nreimburse the trust for losses, thereby preserving trust assets\nheld for their exclusive benefit.Next-friend standing is another apt analog. Long\n\u201caccepted [as a] basis for jurisdiction,\u201d this doctrine allows a\nparty to \u201cappear in [federal] court on behalf of detained prisoners\nwho are unable .\u00a0.\u00a0. to seek relief themselves.\u201dWhitmorev.Arkansas,495 U.S.\n149, 162 (1990) (tracing the doctrine\u2019s roots to the 17th\ncentury). Here, of course, petitioners\u2019 plan cannot access the\ncourts itself because the parties the Court thinks should file suit\n(the fiduciaries) are the defendants. Like a \u201cnext friend,\u201d\nmoreover, petitioners are \u201cdedicated to the best interests\u201d of the\nparty they seek to protect,id., at 163, because the plan\u2019s\ninterests are petitioners\u2019 interests.[7]Congress was on well-established ground when it\nallowed pension participants and beneficiaries to sue on their\nretirement plan\u2019s behalf.2The Court\u2019s conflicting conclusion starts with\ninapposite cases. It invokesHollingsworthv.Perry,570 U.S.\n693, 708 (2013), reasoning that \u201cto claim \u2018the interests of\nothers, the litigants themselves still must have suffered an injury\nin fact.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAnte, at 4.Perry, a case about a\nCalifornia ballot initiative, is a far cry from this one.Perryfound that \u201cprivate parties\u201d with no stake in the\nlitigation \u201cdistinguishable from the general interest of every\ncitizen\u201d were not proper representatives of the State. 570\nU.\u00a0S., at 707, 710. If anything,Perrysupports\npetitioners here: This Court found \u201creadily distinguishable\u201d other\nrepresentational-standing cases by underscoring their sound\ntraditions.Id., at 711 (distinguishing assignee and\nnext-friend standing).[8] A\ntraditional beneficiary-versus-trustee claim like petitioners\u2019 is\nexactly such a suit.Next, the Court maintains that petitioners \u201chave\nnot been legally or contractually assigned\u201d or \u201cappointed\u201d to\nrepresent the plan.Ante, at 5. Although a formal assignment\nor appointment suffices for standing, it is not necessary. See,e.g.,Food and Commercial Workers, 517 U.\u00a0S., at\n552;Whitmore, 495 U.\u00a0S., at 162. Regardless, Congress\nexpressly and thereby legally assigned pension-plan participants\nand beneficiaries the right to represent their plan, including in\nlawsuits where the other would-be representative is the defendant.\n29 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a71132(a)(2), (3); see also,e.g.,\nRestatement (Third) of Trusts \u00a794, Commentd(1), at\u00a07\n(trust terms may confer standing to sue the trustee). ERISA was\n\u201cprimarily concerned with the possible misuse of plan assets, and\nwith remedies that would protect the entire plan.\u201dRussell,\n473 U.\u00a0S., at 142; see alsoid., at 140\u2013142,\nnn.\u00a08\u20139.[9] Far from\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018automatically\u2019\u00a0\u201d conferring petitioners standing to\nsue or creating an injury from whole cloth, cf.ante,at 5,\nERISA assigns the right to sue on the plan\u2019s unquestionably\ncognizable harm: here, fiduciary breaches causing wrongful gains\nand hundreds of millions of dollars in losses. So even under the\nCourt\u2019s framing, it does not matter whether petitioners \u201csustained\nany monetary injury,\u201dante, at 2, because their pension plan\ndid.To support standing, a statute may (but need\nnot) legally designate a party to sue on another\u2019s behalf. Because\nERISA does so here, petitioners should be permitted to sue for\ntheir pension plan\u2019s sake.IIIThe Court also notes that \u201c[e]ven if a\ndefined-benefit plan is mismanaged into plan termination, the\nfederal [Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation] by law acts as a\nbackstop and covers the vested pension benefits up to a certain\namount and often in full.\u201dAnte,at 8, n.\u00a02. The Court\nthen suggests that the only way beneficiaries of a mismanaged plan\ncould sue is if their benefits were not \u201cguaranteed in full by the\nPBGC.\u201dIbid.Those statements underscore the problem in\ntoday\u2019s decision. Whereas ERISA and petitioners\u2019 Plan Document\nexplicitly mandate that all plan assets be handled prudently and\nloyally for petitioners\u2019 exclusive benefit, the Court suggests that\nbeneficiaries should endure disloyalty, imprudence, and plan\nmismanagement so long as the Federal Government is there to pick up\nthe bill when \u201cthe plan and the employer\u201d \u201cfail.\u201dIbid.But the purpose of ERISA and fiduciary duties is\nto prevent retirement-plan failure in the first place. 29\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71001. In barely more than a decade, the country\n(indeed the world) has experienced two unexpected financial crises\nthat have rocked the existence and stability of many employers once\nthought incapable of failing. ERISA deliberately provides\nprotection regardless whether an employer is on sound financial\nfooting one day because it may not be so stable the next. Seeibid.[10]The Court\u2019s references to Government insurance\nalso overlook sobering truths about the PBGC. The Government\nAccountability Office recently relisted the PBGC as one of the\n\u201cHigh Risk\u201d Government programs most likely to become insolvent.\nSee GAO, Report to Congressional Committees, High-Risk Series:\nSubstantial Efforts Needed To Achieve Greater Progress on High-Risk\nAreas (GAO\u201319\u2013157SP, 2019) (GAO High-Risk Report). Noting the\ninsolvency of defined-benefit plans that the PBGC insures and the\n\u201csignificant financial risk and governance challenges that the PBGC\nfaces,\u201d the GAO High-Risk Report warns that \u201cthe retirement\nbenefits of millions of American workers and retirees could be at\nrisk of dramatic reductions\u201d within four years.Id., at\n56\u201357. At last count, the PBGC\u2019s \u201cnet accumulated financial\ndeficit\u201d was \u201cover $51 billion\u201d and its \u201cexposure to potential\nfuture losses for underfunded plans\u201d was \u201cnearly $185 billion.\u201dId.,at 267. Notably, the GAO had issued these warnings\nbefore the current financial crisis struck. Exchanging ERISA\u2019s\nfiduciary duties for Government insurance would only add to the\nPBGC\u2019s plight and require taxpayers to bail out pension plans.IVIt is hard to overstate the harmful\nconsequences of the Court\u2019s conclusion. With ERISA, \u201cthe crucible\nof congressional concern was misuse and mismanagement of plan\nassets by plan administrators.\u201dRussell, 473 U.\u00a0S., at\n141, n.\u00a08. In imposing fiduciary duties and providing a\nprivate right of action, Congress \u201cdesigned\u201d the statute \u201cto\nprevent these abuses in the future.\u201dIbid.Yet today\u2019s\noutcome encourages the very mischief ERISA meant to end.After today\u2019s decision, about 35 million people\nwith defined-benefit plans[11] will be vulnerable to fiduciary misconduct. The\nCourt\u2019s reasoning allows fiduciaries to misuse pension funds so\nlong as the employer has a strong enough balance sheet during (or,\nas alleged here, because of\u00a0) the misbehavior. Indeed, the\nCourt holds that the Constitution forbids retirees to remedy or\nprevent fiduciary breaches in federal court until their retirement\nplan or employer is on the brink of financial ruin. Seeante, at 7\u20138. This is a remarkable result, and not only\nbecause this case is bookended by two financial crises. There is no\ndenying that the Great Recession contributed to the plan\u2019s massive\nlosses and statutory underfunding, or that the present pandemic\npunctuates the perils of imprudent and disloyal financial\nmanagement.Today\u2019s result also disrupts the purpose of\nERISA and the trust funds it requires. Trusts have trustees and\nfiduciary duties to protect the assets and the beneficiaries from\nthe vicissitudes of fortune. Fiduciary duties, especially loyalty,\nare potent prophylactic rules that restrain trustees \u201ctempted to\nexploit [a] trust.\u201d Bogert & Bogert \u00a7543. Congress thus\nrecognized that one of the best ways to protect retirement plans\nwas to codify the same fiduciary duties and beneficiary-enforcement\npowers that have existed for centuries.E.g., 29\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a71001(b), 1109, 1132. Along those lines, courts\nonce held fiduciaries to a higher standard: \u201cNot honesty alone, but\nthe punctilio of an honor the most sensitive.\u201dMeinhardv.Salmon, 249 N.Y. 458, 464, 164 N.E. 545, 546 (1928)\n(Cardozo, C. J.). Not so today.Nor can petitioners take comfort in the\nso-called \u201cregulatory phalanx\u201d guarding defined-benefit plans from\nmismanagement.Ante, at 7. Having divested ERISA of\nenforceable fiduciary duties and beneficiaries of their right to\nsue, the Court lists \u201cemployers and their shareholders,\u201d other\nfiduciaries, and the \u201cDepartment of Labor\u201d as parties on whom\nretirees should rely.Ante, at 6\u20137.But there are\nserious holes in the Court\u2019s proffered line of defense.The Court\u2019s proposed solutions offer nothing in\na case like this one. The employer, its shareholders, and the\nplan\u2019s cofiduciaries here have no reason to bring suit because they\neither committed or profited from the misconduct. Recall the\nallegations: Respondents misused a pension plan\u2019s assets to invest\nin their own mutual funds, pay themselves excessive fees, and swell\nthe employer\u2019s income and stock prices. Nor is the Court\u2019s\nsuggestion workable in the mine run of cases. The reason the Court\ngives for trusting employers and shareholders to look out for\nbeneficiaries\u2014\u201cbecause the employers are entitled to the plan\nsurplus and are often on the hook for plan shortfalls,\u201dante, at 6\u2014is what commentators call a conflict of\ninterest.[12]Neither is the Federal Government\u2019s enforcement\npower a palliative. \u201cERISA makes clear that Congress did not intend\nfor Government enforcement powers to lessen the responsibilities of\nplan fiduciaries.\u201dCentral States, 472 U.\u00a0S., at 578.\nThe Secretary of Labor, moreover, signed a brief (in support of\npetitioners) verifying that the Federal Government cannot \u201cmonitor\nevery [ERISA] plan in the country.\u201d Brief for United States asAmicus Curiae26. Even when the Government can sue (in a\nrepresentational capacity, of course), it cannot seek all the\nrelief that a participant or beneficiary could. Compare 29\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71132(a)(2) with \u00a71132(a)(3). At bottom, the\nCourt rejects ERISA\u2019s private-enforcement scheme and suggests a\npreference that taxpayers fund the monitoring (and perhaps the\nbailing out) of pension plans. Seeante, at 6\u20138, and\nn.\u00a02.Finally, in justifying today\u2019s outcome, the\nCourt discusses attorney\u2019s fees. Twice the Court underlines that\nattorneys have a \u201c$31 million\u201d \u201cstake\u201d in this case.Ante, at 2,\u00a03. But no one in this litigation has\nsuggested attorney\u2019s fees as a basis for standing. As the Court\nappears to admit, its focus on fees is about optics, not law. Seeante, at 3 (acknowledging that attorney\u2019s fees do not\nadvance the standing inquiry).The Court\u2019s aside about attorneys is not only\nmisplaced, it is also mistaken. Missing from the Court\u2019s opinion is\nany recognition that\u00a0Congress found private enforcement suits\nand fiduciary duties critical to policing retirement plans; that it\nwas after this litigation was initiated that respondents restored\n$311 million to the plan in compliance with statutorily required\nfunding levels; and that counsel justified their fee request as a\nbelow-market percentage of the $311 million employer infusion that\nthis lawsuit allegedly precipitated.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*The Constitution, the common law, and the\nCourt\u2019s cases confirm what common sense tells us: People may\nprotect their pensions. \u201cCourts,\u201d the majority surmises, \u201csometimes\nmake standing law more complicated than it needs to be.\u201dAnte, at 8. Indeed. Only by overruling, ignoring, or\nmisstating centuries of law could the Court hold that the\nConstitution requires beneficiaries to watch idly as their supposed\nfiduciaries misappropriate their pension funds. I respectfully\ndissent.Notes1Employee Retirement\nIncome Security Act of 1974, 88Stat. 829, as amended, 29\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71001et\u00a0seq.2Generally, \u201ca trust is\ncreated when one person (a \u2018settlor\u2019 or \u2018grantor\u2019) transfers\nproperty to a third party (a \u2018trustee\u2019) to administer for the\nbenefit of another (a \u2018beneficiary\u2019).\u201dNorth Carolina Dept. of\nRevenuev.Kimberley Rice Kaestner 1992 Family Trust,\n588 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2019) (slip op., at 2); see also\nRestatement (Second) of Trusts \u00a72 (1957). Neither the Court nor\nrespondents dispute that petitioners\u2019 pension fund meets these\nelements.3Even contingent and\ndiscretionary beneficiaries (those who might not ever receive any\nassets from the trust) can sue to protect the trust absent a\npersonal financial loss (or an imminent risk of loss). See A. Hess,\nG. Bogert, & G. Bogert, Law of Trusts and Trustees \u00a7871 (June\n2019 update) (Bogert & Bogert) (listing cases).4The Court expressly\ndeclined to address other relief like that provided under\n\u00a71132(a)(3), seeLaRue, 552 U.\u00a0S., at 252, a provision\nthat petitioners invoke here.5Curiously, today\u2019s Court\nsuggests that ERISA\u2019s efforts to bolster trust-law fiduciary duties\nactually degraded them instead. Seeante, at 4 (justifying a\nnarrow construction of ERISA protections because \u201ctrust law informs\nbut does not control interpretation of ERISA\u201d). Yet the case the\nCourt cites,Varity Corp.v.Howe,516 U.S.\n489(1996), relied on trust law to establish the minimum\nobligations ERISA imposes on plan fiduciaries. Seeid., at\n506 (confirming that the \u201cERISA fiduciary duty includes [the]\ncommon law duty of loyalty\u201d). Today\u2019s Court mistakes the floor for\nthe ceiling. Seeibid.; see alsoHarris Trust, 530\nU.\u00a0S., at 241\u2013242.6This Court has found\nstanding in myriad cases involving noneco-nomic injuries. Examples\ninclude the denial or threatened impairment of: equal treatment,Adarand Constructors,Inc.v.Pe\u00f1a,515 U.S.\n200, 211 (1995);Northeastern Fla. Chapter,Associated Gen. Contractors of Americav.Jacksonville,508 U.S.\n656, 666 (1993); \u201ctruthful information concerning the\navailability of housing,\u201dHavens Realty Corp.v.Coleman,455 U.S.\n363, 373 (1982); esthetic and recreational interests,Friends of the Earth,Inc.v.Laidlaw\nEnvironmental Services (TOC),Inc.,528 U.S.\n167, 181\u2013182 (2000); \u201cinformation which must be publicly\ndisclosed pursuant to a statute,\u201dFederal Election Comm\u2019nv.Akins,524 U.S.\n11, 21 (1998); one\u2019s \u201cpersonal, political, and professional\nreputation,\u201dMeesev.Keene,481\nU.S. 465, 473 (1987); and the right to speak,Spokeo,\n578 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 9) (citingPleasant Grove\nCityv.Summum,555 U.S.\n460(2009)). This Court has even said that a for-profit\nbusiness has standing to assert religious injuries. SeeBurwellv.Hobby Lobby Stores,Inc.,573 U.S.\n682, 715, and n.\u00a026 (2014). Today\u2019s Court does not\nreconcile these cases with its novel financial-harm requirement;\nnor does the Court explain why a breach of fiduciary duty is less\nconcrete than the injuries listed above.7Other examples include\nguardians ad\u00a0litem and, of course, trustees.E.g.,Sprint Communications Co.v.APCC Services,Inc.,554\nU.S. 269, 287 (2008) (noting in the Article III standing\ncontext that \u201cfederal courts routinely entertain suits which will\nresult in relief for parties that are not themselves directly\nbringing suit,\u201d such as when \u201c[t]rustees bring suits to benefit\ntheir trusts\u201d); see alsoid., at 304\u2013305, n.\u00a02\n(Roberts, C.\u00a0J., dissenting) (\u201cTrustees, guardians\nad\u00a0litem, executors, and the like make up a settled,\ncontinuous practice \u2018of the sort traditionally amenable to, and\nresolved by, the judicial process\u2019\u00a0\u201d).8The Court cites two more\ncases:Gollustv.Mendell,501\nU.S. 115(1991), andCraigv.Boren,429 U.S.\n190(1976). But both endorsed expansive views of standing. SeeGollust, 501 U.\u00a0S., at 125\u2013127 (allowing indirect\nowners of a corporation to sue under federal securities laws);Craig, 429 U.\u00a0S., at 194\u2013195 (holding that a plaintiff\nhad representational standing to assert an equal protection claim\non a business patron\u2019s behalf\u00a0). To the extent the Court\nsuggests that a financial loss is necessary (or that a breach of\nfiduciary duty is insufficient) for standing, that is incorrect.\nSee Part II\u2013B,supra.9NeitherSprint,554 U.S.\n269, norVermont Agency of Natural Resourcesv.United States ex rel. Stevens,529 U.S.\n765(2000), is to the contrary. Cf.ante, at 5. Both\ndecisions undermine today\u2019s result. SeeSprint, 554\nU.\u00a0S., at 280, 287 (noting in the Article III context that\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018naked legal title\u2019\u00a0\u201d has long permitted suit and that\n\u201cfederal courts routinely entertain suits which will result in\nrelief for parties that are not themselves directly bringing suit,\u201d\nsuch as when \u201c[t]rustees bring suits to benefit their trusts\u201d);Vermont Agency, 529 U.\u00a0S., at 774 (showing that even a\npartial statutory assignment grants constitutional standing to sue\non another\u2019s behalf\u00a0).10This\nalso explains why a material risk of loss is not a prerequisite for\nstanding, least of all for retirees relying on their retirement\nplan for income.

Chi. L. Rev. 1105, 1121 (1988).
