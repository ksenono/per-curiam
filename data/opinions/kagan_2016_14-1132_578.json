We hold today that the\njurisdictional test established by that provision is the same as\nthe one used to decide if a case \u201carises under\u201d a federal law. See\n28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71331.IRespondent Greg Manning held more than two\nmillion shares of stock in Escala Group, Inc., a company traded on\nthe NASDAQ. Between 2006 and 2007, Escala\u2019s share price plummeted\nand Manning lost most of his investment. Manning blames\npetitioners, Merrill Lynch and several other financial institutions\n(collectively, Merrill Lynch), for devaluing Escala during that\nperiod through \u201cnaked short sales\u201d of its stock.A typical short sale of a security is one made\nby a borrower, rather than an owner, of stock. In such a\ntransaction, a person borrows stock from a broker, sells it to a\nbuyer on the open market, and later purchases the same number of\nshares to return to the broker. The short seller\u2019s hope is that the\nstock price will decline between the time he sells the borrowed\nshares and the time he buys replacements to pay back his loan. If\nthat happens, the seller gets to pocket the difference (minus\nassociated transaction costs).In a \u201cnaked\u201d short sale, by contrast, the seller\nhas not borrowed (or otherwise obtained) the stock he puts on the\nmarket, and so never delivers the promised shares to the buyer. See\u201cNaked\u201d Short Selling Antifraud Rule, Securities Exchange\nCommission (SEC) Release No. 34\u201358774, 73 Fed. Reg. 61667 (2008).\nThat practice (beyond its effect on individual purchasers) can\nserve \u201cas a tool to drive down a company\u2019s stock price\u201d\u2014which, of\ncourse, injures shareholders like Manning.Id.,at 61670.\nThe SEC regulates such short sales at the federal level: The\nCommission\u2019s Regulation SHO, issued under the Exchange Act,\nprohibits short sellers from intentionally failing to deliver\nsecurities and thereby curbs market manipulation. See 17 CFR\n\u00a7\u00a7242.203\u2013242.204 (2015).In this lawsuit, Manning (joined by six other\nformer Escala shareholders) alleges that Merrill Lynch facilitated\nand engaged in naked short sales of Escala stock, in violation of\nNew Jersey law. His complaint asserts that Merrill Lynch\nparticipated in \u201cshort sales at times when [it] neither possessed,\nnor had any intention of obtaining[,] sufficient stock\u201d to deliver\nto buyers. App. to Pet. for Cert. 57a, Amended Complaint \u00b639. That\nconduct, Manning charges, contravened provisions of the New Jersey\nRacketeerInfluenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), New\nJersey Criminal Code, and New Jersey Uniform Securities Law; it\nalso, he adds, ran afoul of the New Jersey common law of\nnegligence, unjust enrichment, and interference with contractual\nrelations. Seeid., at 82a\u2013101a, \u00b6\u00b688\u2013161. Manning chose not\nto bring any claims under federal securities laws or rules. His\ncomplaint, however, referred explicitly to Regulation SHO, both\ndescribing the purposes of that rule and cataloguing past\naccusations against Merrill Lynch for flouting its requirements.\nSeeid.,at 51a\u201354a, \u00b6\u00b628\u201330; 75a\u201382a, \u00b6\u00b681\u201387. And the\ncomplaint couched its description of the short selling at issue\nhere in terms suggesting that Merrill Lynch had again violated that\nregulation, in addition to infringing New Jersey law. Seeid.,at 57a\u201359a, \u00b6\u00b639\u201343.Manning brought his complaint in New Jersey\nstate court, but Merrill Lynch removed the case to Federal District\nCourt. See 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71441 (allowing removal of any\ncivil action of which federal district courts have original\njurisdiction). Merrill Lynch asserted federal jurisdiction on two\ngrounds. First, it invoked the general federal question statute,\n\u00a71331, which grants district courts jurisdiction of \u201call civil\nactions arising under\u201d federal law. Second, it maintained that the\nsuit belonged in federal court by virtue of \u00a727 of the Exchange\nAct. That provision, in relevant part, grants district courts\nexclusive jurisdiction of \u201call suits in equity and actions at law\nbrought to enforce any liability or duty created by [the Exchange\nAct] or the rules and regulations thereunder.\u201d 15\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a778aa(a). Manning moved to remand the case to\nstate court, arguing that neither statute gave the federal court\nauthority to adjudicate his collection of state-law claims. The\nDistrict Court denied his motion. See No. 12\u20134466 (D NJ, Mar. 18,\n2013), App. to Pet. for Cert. 24a\u201338a.The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit\nreversed, ordering a remand of the case to state court. See 772\nF.\u00a03d 158 (2014). The Third Circuit first decided that the\nfed-eral question statute, 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71331, did not\nconfer juris-diction of the suit, because all Manning\u2019s claims were\n\u201cbrought under state law\u201d and none \u201cnecessarily raised\u201d a federal\nissue. 772 F.\u00a03d,at 161, 163. Nor, the court held, did\n\u00a727 of the Exchange Act make the district court the appropriate\nforum. Relying on this Court\u2019s construction of a nearly identical\njurisdictional provision, the Court of Appeals found that \u00a727\ncovers only those cases involving the Exchange Act that would\nsatisfy the \u201carising under\u201d test of the federal question statute.\nSeeid.,at 166\u2013167 (citingPan American Petroleum\nCorp.v.Superior Court of Del. for New Castle Cty., 366\nU.\u00a0S. 656 (1961) ). Because the District Court lacked\njurisdiction of Manning\u2019s suit under \u00a71331, so too it was not the\nexclusive forum under \u00a727.Merrill Lynch sought this Court\u2019s review solely\nas to whether \u00a727 commits Manning\u2019s case to federal court. See Pet.\nfor Cert. i. Because of a Circuit split about that provision\u2019s\nmeaning,[1] we granted\ncertiorari. 576 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2015). We now affirm.IILike the Third Circuit, we read \u00a727 as\nconferring exclusive federal jurisdiction of the same suits as\n\u201caris[e] under\u201d the Exchange Act pursuant to the general federal\nquestion statute. See 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71331. The text of \u00a727\nmore readily supports that meaning than it does either of the\nparties\u2019 two alternatives. This Court\u2019s precedents interpreting\nidentical statutory language positively compel that conclusion. And\nthe construction fits with our practice of reading jurisdictional\nlaws, so long as consistent with their language, to respect the\ntraditional role of state courts in our federal system and to\nestablish clear and administrable rules.ASection 27, as noted earlier, provides federal\ndistrict courts with exclusive jurisdiction \u201cof all suits in equity\nand actions at law brought to enforce any liability or duty created\nby [the Exchange Act] or the rules and regulations thereunder.\u201d 15\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a778aa(a); seesupra,at 3.[2] Much the same wording appears in nine\nother federal jurisdictional provisions\u2014mostly enacted, like \u00a727,\nas part of New Deal-era regulatory statutes.[3]Merrill Lynch argues that the \u201cplain,\nunambiguous language\u201d of \u00a727 requires an expansive understanding of\nits scope. Brief for Petitioners 23. Whenever (says Merrill Lynch)\na plaintiff\u2019s complaint either explicitly or implic-itly\n\u201cassert[s]\u201d that \u201cthe defendant breached an Exchange Act duty,\u201d\nthen the suit is \u201cbrought to enforce\u201d that duty and a federal court\nhas exclusive jurisdiction.Id., at 22; Reply Brief 10\u201311;\nsee Tr. of Oral Arg. 7\u20138 (confirming that such allegations need not\nbe express). That is so, Merrill Lynch contends, even if the\nplaintiff, as in this case, brings only state-law claims in his\ncomplaint\u2014that is, seeks relief solely under state law. See Reply\nBrief 3\u20136. And it is so, Merrill Lynch continues, even if the\nplaintiff can prevail on those claims without proving that the\nalleged breach of an Exchange Act duty\u2014here, the violation of\nRegulation SHO\u2014actually occurred. Seeid.,at 7\u201313; Tr. of\nOral Arg. 3 (\u201c[T]he words \u2018brought to enforce\u2019 [donot focus] on\nwhat the court would necessarily have to decide\u201d).But a natural reading of \u00a727\u2019s text does not\nextend so far. \u201cBrought\u201d in this context means \u201ccommenced,\u201d Black\u2019s\nLaw Dictionary 254 (3d ed. 1933);\u201cto\u201d is a word \u201cexpressing\npurpose [or] consequence,\u201d The Concise Oxford Dictionary 1288\n(1931); and \u201cenforce\u201d means \u201cgive force [or] effect to,\u201d 1\nWebster\u2019s New International Dictionary of the English Language 725\n(1927). So \u00a727 confers federal jurisdiction when an action is\ncommenced in order to give effect to an Exchange Act requirement.\nThat language, in emphasizing what the suit is designed to\naccomplish, stops short of embracing any complaint that happens to\nmention a duty established by the Exchange Act. Consider, for\nexample, a simple state-law action for breach of contract, in which\nthe plaintiff alleges, for atmospheric reasons, that the\ndefendant\u2019s conduct also violated the Exchange Act\u2014or still less,\nthat the defendant is a bad actor who infringed that statute on\nanother occasion. On Merrill Lynch\u2019s view, \u00a727 would cover that\nsuit; indeed, Merrill Lynch points to just such incidental\nassertions as the basis for federal jurisdiction here. See Brief\nfor Petitioners 20\u201321;supra,at 3. But that hypothetical\nsuit is \u201cbrought to enforce\u201d state contract law, not the Exchange\nAct\u2014because the plaintiff can get all the relief he seeks just by\nshowing the breach of an agreement, without proving any violation\nof federal securities law. The suit, that is, can achieve all it is\nsupposed to even if issues involving the Exchange Act never come\nup.Critiquing Merrill Lynch\u2019s position on similar\ngrounds, Manning proposes a far more restrictive interpretation of\n\u00a727\u2019s language\u2014one going beyond what he needs to prevail. See Brief\nfor Respondents 27\u201333. According to Manning, a suit is \u201cbrought to\nenforce\u201d the Exchange Act\u2019s duties or liabilities only if it is\nbrought directly under that statute\u2014that is, only if the claims it\nasserts (and not just the duties it means to vindicate) are created\nby the Exchange Act. On that view, everything depends (as Justice\nHolmes famously said in another jurisdictional context) on which\nlaw \u201ccreates the cause of action.\u201dAmerican Well Works Co.v.Layne & Bowler Co., 241 U.\u00a0S. 257, 260 (1916) .\nIf a complaint asserts a right of action deriving from the Exchange\nAct (or an associated regulation), the suit must proceed in federal\ncourt. But if, as here, the complaint brings only state-created\nclaims, then the case belongs in a state forum. And that is so,\nManning claims, even if\u2014contrary to what the Third Circuit held\nbelow\u2014the success of the state claim necessarily hinges on proving\nthat the defendant breached an Exchange Act duty. See Brief for\nRespondents 31.Manning\u2019s view of the text\u2019s requirements,\nalthough better than Merrill Lynch\u2019s, veers too far in the opposite\ndirection. There is no doubt, as Manning says, that a suit\nasserting an Exchange Act cause of action fits within \u00a727\u2019s scope:\nBringing such a suit is the prototypical way of enforcing an\nExchange Act duty. But it is not the only way. On rare occasions,\nas just suggested, a suit raising a state-law claim rises or falls\non the plaintiff\u2019s ability to prove the violation of a federal\nduty. See,e.g., Grable & Sons Metal Products, Inc.v.Darue Engineering & Mfg., 545 U.\u00a0S. 308 \u2013315\n(2005);Smithv.Kansas City Title & Trust Co.,255 U.\u00a0S. 180, 201 (1921) . If in that manner, a state-law\naction necessarily depends on a showing that the defendant breached\nthe Exchange Act, then that suit could also fall within \u00a727\u2019s\ncompass. Suppose, for example, that a state statute simply makes\nillegal \u201cany violation of the Exchange Act involving naked short\nselling.\u201d A plaintiff seeking relief under that state law must\nundertake to prove, as the cornerstone of his suit, that the\ndefendant infringed a requirement of the federal statute. (Indeed,\nin this hypothetical, that is the plaintiff\u2019sonlyproject.)\nAccordingly, his suit, even though asserting a state-created claim,\nis also \u201cbrought to enforce\u201d a duty created by the Exchange\nAct.An existing jurisdictional test well captures\nboth classes of suits \u201cbrought to enforce\u201d such a duty. As noted\nearlier, 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71331 provides federal jurisdiction\nof all civil actions \u201carising under\u201d federal law. Seesupra,at 3. This Court has found that statutory term satisfied in either\nof two circumstances. Most directly, and most often, federal\njurisdiction attaches when federal law creates the cause of action\nasserted. That set of cases is what Manning highlights in offering\nhis view of \u00a727. But even when \u201ca claim finds its origins\u201d in state\nlaw, there is \u201ca special and small category of cases in which\narising under jurisdiction still lies.\u201dGunnv.Minton, 568 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 6) (internal\nquotation marks omitted). As this Court has explained, a federal\ncourt has jurisdiction of a state-law claim if it \u201cnecessarily\nraise[s] a stated federal issue, actually disputed and substantial,\nwhich a federal forum may entertain without disturbing any\ncongressionally approved balance\u201d of federal and state power.Grable, 545 U.\u00a0S., at 314; seeGunn, 568\nU.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 6) (framing the same standard as a\nfour-part test). That description typically fits cases, like those\ndescribed just above, in which a state-law cause of action is\n\u201cbrought to enforce\u201d a duty created by the Exchange Act because the\nclaim\u2019s very success depends on giving effect to a federal\nrequirement. Accordingly, we agree with the court below that \u00a727\u2019s\njurisdictional test matches the one we have formulated for \u00a71331,\nas applied to cases involving the Exchange Act. If (but only if)\nsuch a case meets the \u201carising under\u201d standard, \u00a727 commands that\nit go to federal court.[4]Merrill Lynch objects that our rule construes\n\u201ccompletely different language\u201d\u2014i.e.,the phrases \u201carising\nunder\u201dand \u201cbrought to enforce\u201d in \u00a71331 and \u00a727, respectively\u2014\u201cto\nmean exactly the same thing.\u201d Reply Brief 7. We cannot deny that\npoint. But we think it far less odd than Merrill Lynch does. After\nall, the test for \u00a71331 jurisdiction is not grounded in that\nprovision\u2019s particular phrasing. This Court has long read the words\n\u201carising under\u201d in Article III to extend quite broadly, \u201cto all\ncases in which a federal question is \u2018an ingredient\u2019 of the\naction.\u201dMerrell Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc.v.Thompson, 478 U.\u00a0S. 804 (1986) (quotingOsbornv.Bank of United States,9 Wheat. 738, 823 (1824)). In the\nstatutory context, however, we opted to give those same words a\nnarrower scope \u201cin the light of [\u00a71331\u2019s] history[,] the demands of\nreason and coherence, and the dictates of sound judicial policy.\u201dRomerov.International Terminal Operating Co., 358\nU.\u00a0S. 354, 379 (1959) . Because the resulting test does not\nturn on \u00a71331\u2019s text, there is nothing remarkable in its fitting\nas, or even more, neatly a differently worded statutory\nprovision.Nor can Merrill Lynch claim that Congress\u2019s use\nof the new \u201cbrought to enforce\u201d language in \u00a727 shows an intent to\ndepart from a settled (even if linguistically ungrounded) test for\nstatutory \u201carising under\u201d jurisdiction. That is because no such\nwell-defined test then existed. As we recently noted, our caselaw\nconstruing \u00a71331 was for many decades\u2014including when the Exchange\nAct passed\u2014highly \u201cunruly.\u201dGunn, 568 U.\u00a0S., at __\n(slip op., at 6) (referring to the \u201ccanvas\u201d of our old opinions as\n\u201clook[ing] like one that Jackson Pollock got to first\u201d). Against\nthat muddled backdrop, it is impossible to infer that Congress, in\nenacting \u00a727, wished to depart from what we now understand as the\n\u201carising under\u201d standard.BThis Court has reached the same conclusion\nbefore. In two unrelated decisions, we addressed the \u201cbrought to\nenforce\u201d language at issue here. SeePan American, 366\nU.\u00a0S. 656 ;Matsushita Elec. Industrial Co.v.Epstein, 516 U.\u00a0S. 367 (1996) . Each time, we viewed\nthat phrase as coextensive with our construction of \u201carising\nunder.\u201dPan Americaninvolved \u00a722 of the Natural\nGas Act (NGA), 15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7717u\u2014an exclusive\njurisdiction provision containing language materially\nindistinguishable from \u00a727\u2019s.[5] The case began in state court when a natural gas\npurchaser sued a producer for breach of a contract setting sale\nprices. Prior to the alleged breach, the producer had filed those\ncontractual rates with the Federal Power Commission, as the NGA\nrequired. Relying on that submission (which the complaint did not\nmention), the producer claimed that the buyer\u2019s suit was \u201cbrought\nto enforce\u201d a liability deriving from the NGA\u2014i.e.,a filed\nrate\u2014and so must proceed in federal court. See 366 U.\u00a0S., at\n662. This Court rejected the argument.Our decision explained that \u00a722\u2019s use of the\nterm \u201cbrought to enforce,\u201d rather than \u201carising under,\u201d made no\ndifference to the jurisdictional analysis. The inquiry, we wrote,\nwas \u201cnot affected by want\u201d of the language contained in the federal\nquestion statute.Id.,at 665, n.\u00a02. The\n\u201climitation[s]\u201d associated with \u201carising under\u201d jurisdiction, we\ncontinued, were \u201cclearly implied\u201d in \u00a722\u2019s alternative phrasing.Ibid.In short, the linguistic distinction between the two\njurisdictional provisions did not extend to their meaning.Pan Americanthus went on to analyze the\njurisdictional issue in the manner set out in our \u201carising under\u201d\nprecedents. Federal question jurisdiction lies, the Court wrote,\nonly if \u201cit appears from the face of the complaint that\ndetermination of the suit depends upon a question of federal law.\u201dId.,at 663. That inquiry focuses on \u201cthe particular claims\na suitor makes\u201d in his complaint\u2014meaning, whether the plaintiff\nseeks relief under state or federal law.Id.,at 662. In\naddition, the Court suggested, a federal court could adjudicate a\nsuit stating only a state-law claim if it included as \u201can element,\nand an essential one,\u201d the violation of a federal right.Id., at 663 (quotingGullyv.First Nat. Bank in\nMeridian, 299 U.\u00a0S. 109, 112 (1936) ). With those\nprinciples of \u201carising under\u201d jurisdiction laid out, the Court held\nthat \u00a722 did not enable a federal court to resolve the buyer\u2019s\ncase, because he could prevail merely by proving breach of the\ncontract. See 366 U.\u00a0S.,at 663\u2013665.Pan\nAmericanestablishes, then, that an action \u201cbrought to enforce\u201d\na duty or liability created by a federal statute is nothing more\n(and nothing less) than an action \u201carising under\u201d that law.Merrill Lynch readsPan Americanmore\nnarrowly, as holding only that \u00a722 does not confer federal\njurisdiction when a complaint (unlike Manning\u2019s) fails to reference\nfederal law at all. See Brief for Petitioners 32\u201333, 38. But that\nargument ignoresPan American\u2019s express statement of\nequivalence between \u00a727\u2019s language and the federal question\nstatute\u2019s: \u201cBrought to enforce\u201d has the same \u201climitation[s]\u201d\n(meaning, the same scope) as \u201carising under.\u201d 366 U.\u00a0S., at\n665, n.\u00a02. And just as important, Merrill Lynch disregardsPan American\u2019s analytical structure: The decision proceeds\nby reviewing this Court\u2019s \u201carising under\u201d precedents, articulating\nthe principles animating that caselaw, and then applying those\ntenets to the dispute at hand.Id.,at 662\u2013665. The Court\nthus showed (as well as told) that \u201cbrought to enforce\u201d\njurisdiction mirrors that of \u201carising under.\u201dAs a fallback, Merrill Lynch claims thatPan\nAmericanis irrelevant here because it relied on legislative\nhistory distinct to the NGA in finding \u00a722\u2019s \u201cbrought to enforce\u201d\nlanguage coterminous with \u201carising under.\u201d See Brief for\nPetitioners 38\u201339. The premise of that argument is true enough: In\nsupport of its holding, the Court quoted a Committee Report\ndescribing \u00a722 as conferring federal jurisdiction \u201cover cases\narising under the act.\u201d 366 U.\u00a0S., at 665, n.\u00a02. But we\ncannot accept the conclusion Merrill Lynch draws from that\nstatement: that courts should give two identically worded statutory\nprovisions, passed less than five years apart, markedly different\nmeanings. Indeed, the result of Merrill Lynch\u2019s approach is still\nodder, for what of the eight other jurisdictional provisions\ncontaining \u201cbrought to enforce\u201d language? See n.\u00a03,supra. Presumably, Merrill Lynch would have courts inspect\neach of their legislative histories to decide whether to read those\nstatutes as reproducing the \u201carising under\u201d standard, adopting\nMerrill Lynch\u2019s alternative view, or demanding yet another\njurisdictional test. We are hard pressed to imagine a less sensible\nway of construing the repeated iterations of the phrase \u201cbrought to\nenforce\u201d in the jurisdictional provisions of the Federal Code.In any event, this Court inMatsushitaaddressed \u00a727 itself, and once again equated the \u201cbrought to\nenforce\u201d and \u201carising under\u201d standards. That decision arose from a\nstate-law action against corporate directors for breach of\nfiduciary duty. The issue was whether the state court handling the\nsuit could approve a settlement releasing, in addition to the state\nclaims actually brought, potential Exchange Act claims that \u00a727\nwould have committed to federal court. In deciding that the state\ncourt could do so, we described \u00a727\u2014not once, not twice, but three\ntimes\u2014as conferring exclusive jurisdiction of suits \u201carising under\u201d\nthe Exchange Act. See 516 U.\u00a0S., at 380 (Section 27 \u201cconfers\nexclusive jurisdiction upon the federal courts for suitsarising\nunderthe [Exchange] Act\u201d);id.,at 381 (Section 27\n\u201cprohibits state courts from adjudicating claimsarising\nunderthe Exchange Act\u201d);id.,at 385 (Section 27\n\u201cprohibit[s] state courts from exercising jurisdiction over suitsarising underthe Exchange Act\u201d) (emphases added). Over and\nover, then, the Court took as a given that \u00a727\u2019s jurisdictional\ntest mimicked the one in the general federal question statute.And still more: TheMatsushitaCourt\nthought clear that the suit as filed\u2014which closely resembled\nManning\u2019s in its mix of state and federal law\u2014fell outside \u00a727\u2019s\ngrant of exclusive jurisdiction. As just noted, the claims brought\nin theMatsushitacomplaint sought relief for breach of a\nstate-law duty. But in support of those claims, the plaintiffs\ncharged, much as Manning did here, that the defendants\u2019 conduct\nalso violated federal securities laws. See 516 U.\u00a0S., at 370;supra,at 2\u20133. We found the presence of that accusation\ninsufficient to trigger \u00a727. \u201c[T]he cause pleaded,\u201d we wrote,\nremained \u201ca state common-law action,\u201d 516 U.\u00a0S., at 382,\nn.\u00a07: Notwithstanding the potential federal issue, the suit\n\u201cwas not \u2018brought to enforce\u2019 any rights or obligations under the\n[Exchange] Act,\u201did.,at 381. The Court thus rejected the\nvery position Merrill Lynch takes here\u2014i.e., that \u00a727\nprecludes a state court from adjudicating any case, even if brought\nunder state law, in which the plaintiff asserts an Exchange Act\nbreach.CConstruing \u00a727, consistent with both text and\nprecedent, to cover suits that arise under the Exchange Act serves\nthe goals we have consistently underscored in interpreting\njurisdictional statutes. Our reading, unlike Merrill Lynch\u2019s, gives\ndue deference to the important role of state courts in our federal\nsystem. And the standard we adopt is more straightforward and\nadministrable than the alternative Merrill Lynch offers.Out of respect for state courts, this Court has\ntime and again declined to construe federal jurisdictional statutes\nmore expansively than their language, most fairly read, requires.\nWe have reiterated the need to give \u201c[d]ue regard [to] the rightful\nindependence of state governments\u201d\u2014and more particularly, to the\npower of the States \u201cto provide for the determination of\ncontroversies in their courts.\u201dRomero, 358 U.\u00a0S., at\n380 (quotingHealyv.Ratta, 292 U.\u00a0S. 263, 270\n(1934) ;Shamrock Oil & Gas Corp.v.Sheets, 313\nU.\u00a0S. 100, 109 (1941) . Our decisions, as we once put the\npoint, reflect a \u201cdeeply felt and traditional reluctance\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. to expand the jurisdiction of federal courts\nthrough a broad reading of jurisdictional statutes.\u201dRomero,\n358 U.\u00a0S., at 379.[6] That\ninterpretive stance serves, among other things, to keep state-law\nactions like Manning\u2019s in state court, and thus to help maintainthe\nconstitutional balance between state and federaljudiciaries.Nor does this Court\u2019s concern for state court\nprerogatives disappear, as Merrill Lynch suggests it should, in the\nface of a statute granting exclusive federal jurisdiction. See\nBrief for Petitioners 23\u201327. To the contrary, when a statute\nmandates, rather than permits, federal jurisdiction\u2014thus depriving\nstate courts of all ability to adjudicate certain claims\u2014our\nreluctance to endorse \u201cbroad reading[s],\u201dRomero, 358\nU.\u00a0S., at 379, if anything, grows stronger. And that is\nespecially so when, as here, the construction offered would place\nin federal court actions bringing only claims created by state\nlaw\u2014even if those claims might raise federal issues. To be sure, a\ngrant of exclusive federal jurisdiction, as Merrill Lynch reminds\nus, indicates that Congress wanted \u201cgreater uniformity of\nconstruction and more effective and expert application\u201d of federal\nlaw than usual. Brief for Petitioners 24 (quotingMatsushita,516 U.\u00a0S., at 383). But \u201cgreater\u201d and\n\u201cmore\u201d do not mean \u201ctotal,\u201d and the critical question remains how\nfar such a grant extends. In resolving that issue, we will not\nlightly read the statute to alter the usual constitu-tional\nbalance, as it would by sending actions with all state-law claims\nto federal court just because a complaint references a federal\nduty.Our precedents construing other exclusive grants\nof federal jurisdiction illustrate those principles. InPan\nAmerican, for example, we denied that a state court\u2019s\nresolution of state-law claims potentially implicating the NGA\u2019s\nmeaning would \u201cjeopardize the uniform system of regulation\u201d that\nthe statute established. 366 U.\u00a0S., at 665. We reasoned that\nthis Court\u2019s ability to review state court decisions of federal\nquestions would sufficiently protect federal interests. And\nsimilarly, inTafflinv.Levitt, 493 U.\u00a0S. 455\n\u2013467 (1990), we permitted state courts to adjudicate civil RICO\nactions that might raise issues about the scope of federal crimes\nalleged as predicate acts, even though federal courts have\nexclusive jurisdiction \u201cof all offenses against the laws of the\nUnited States,\u201d 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73231. There, we expressed\nconfidence that state courts would look to federal court\ninterpretations of the relevant criminal statutes. Accordingly, we\nsaw \u201cno significant danger of inconsistent application of federal\ncriminal law\u201d and no \u201cincompatibility with federal interests.\u201dTafflin,493 U.\u00a0S., at 464\u2013465, 467 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).So too here, when state courts, in deciding\nstate-law claims, address possible issues of the Exchange Act\u2019s\nmeaning. Not even Merrill Lynch thinks those decisions wholly\navoidable: It admits that \u00a727 does nothing to prevent state courts\nfrom resolving Exchange Act questions that result from defenses or\ncounterclaims. See Brief for Petitioners 32\u201333;Pan\nAmerican,366 U.\u00a0S., at 664\u2013665. We see little difference,\nin terms of the uniformity-based policies Merrill Lynch invokes, if\nthose issues instead appear in a complaint like Manning\u2019s. And\nindeed, Congress likely contemplated that some complaints\nintermingling state and federal questions would be brought in state\ncourt: After all, Congress specifically affirmed the capacity of\nsuch courts to hear state-law securities actions, which predictably\nraise issues coinciding, overlapping, or intersecting with those\nunder the Act itself. See 15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a778bb(a)(2);Matsushita, 516 U.\u00a0S., at 383. So, for example, it is\nhardly surprising in a suit like this one, alleging short sales in\nviolation ofstatesecurities law, that a plaintiff might\nsay the defendant previously breached afederalprohibition\nof similar conduct. Seesupra,at 2\u20133 (describing Manning\u2019s\ncomplaint). And it is less troubling for a state court to consider\nsuch an issue than to lose all ability to adjudicate a suit raising\nonly state-law causes of action.Reading \u00a727 in line with our \u00a71331 caselaw also\npromotes \u201cadministrative simplicity[, which] is a major virtue in a\njurisdictional statute.\u201dHertz Corp.v.Friend, 559\nU.\u00a0S. 77, 94 (2010) . Both judges and litigants are familiar\nwith the \u201carising under\u201d standard and how it works. For the most\npart, that test provides ready answers to jurisdictional questions.\nAnd an existing body of precedent gives guidance whenever\nborderline cases crop up. Seesupra,at 8\u20139. By contrast, no\none has experience with Merrill Lynch\u2019s alternative standard, which\nwould spring out of nothing to govern suits involving not only the\nExchange Act but up to nine other discrete spheres of federal law.\nSee n.\u00a03,supra(listing statutes with \u201cbrought to\nenforce\u201d language);supra,at 12\u201313 (noting Merrill Lynch\u2019s\nbackup claim that legislative histories might compel different\ntests for different statutes). Adopting such an untested approach,\nand forcing courts to toggle back and forth between it and the\n\u201carising under\u201d standard, would undermine consistency and\npredictability in litigation. That result disserves courts and\nparties alike.Making matters worse, Merrill Lynch\u2019s rule is\nsimple for plaintiffs to avoid\u2014or else, excruciating for courts to\npolice. Under that rule, a plaintiff electing to bring state-law\nclaims in state court will purge his complaint of any references to\nfederal securities law, so as to escape re-moval. Such omissions,\nafter all, will do nothing to change the way the plaintiff can\npresent his case at trial; they will merely make the complaint less\ninformative. Recognizing the potential for that kind of avoidance,\nMerrill Lynch argues that a judge should go behind the face of a\ncomplaint to determine whether it is the product of \u201cartful\npleading.\u201d See Tr. of Oral Arg. 7 (If the plaintiffs \u201chad just\nliterally whited out, deleted the references to Reg[ulation] SHO,\u201d\nthe court should still understand the complaint to allege a breach\nof that rule; \u201cthe fact [that the plaintiffs] didn\u2019t cite it\nwouldn\u2019t change the fact\u201d). We have no idea how a court would make\nthat judgment, and get cold comfort from Merrill Lynch\u2019s assurance\nthat the question would arise not in this case but in \u201cthe next\nthird, fourth, fifth case down the road.\u201dId.,at 8.\nJurisdictional tests are built for more than a single dispute: That\nMerrill Lynch\u2019s threatens to become either a useless drafting rule\nor a tortuous inquiry into artful pleading is one more good reason\nto reject it.IIISection 27 provides exclusive federal\njurisdiction of the same class of cases as \u201carise under\u201d the\nExchange Act for purposes of \u00a71331. The text of \u00a727, most naturally\nread, supports that rule. This Court has adopted the same view in\ntwo prior cases. And that reading of the statute promotes the twin\ngoals, important in interpreting jurisdictional grants, of\nrespecting state courts and providing administrable standards.Our holding requires remanding Manning\u2019s suit to\nstate court. The Third Circuit found that the District Court did\nnot have jurisdiction of Manning\u2019s suit under \u00a71331 because all his\nclaims sought relief under state law and none necessarily raised a\nfederal issue. Seesupra,at 3. Merrill Lynch did not\nchallenge that ruling, and we therefore take it as a given. And\nthat means, under our decision today, that the District Court also\nlacked jurisdiction under \u00a727. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment\nbelow.It is so ordered.Notes1Compare 772 F.\u00a03d\n158 (CA3 2014) (case below) withBarbarav.New York\nStock Exchange, Inc., 99 F.\u00a03d 49, 55 (CA2 1996)\n(construing \u00a727 more narrowly),Sparta Surgical Corp.v.National Assn. of Securities Dealers, Inc., 159 F.\u00a03d\n1209, 1211\u20131212 (CA9 1998) (construing \u00a727 more broadly), andHawkinsv.National Assn. of Securities Dealers,\nInc., 149 F.\u00a03d 330, 331\u2013332 (CA5 1998) (per\ncuriam) (same).2Section 27 also grants\nfederal courts exclusive jurisdiction of \u201cviolations of [the\nExchange Act] or the rules and regulations thereunder.\u201d 15 U. S. C.\n\u00a778aa(a). Manning argues that the \u201cviolations\u201d language applies\nonly to criminal proceedings and SEC enforcement actions. See Brief\nfor Respondents 28. Merrill Lynch, although not conceding that\nmuch, believes the \u201cviolations\u201d clause irrelevant here because, in\nprivate suits for damages, it goes no further than the \u201cbrought to\nenforce\u201d language quoted in the text. See Reply Brief 1, n.\u00a01.\nGiven that both parties have thus taken the \u201cviolations\u201d language\noff the table, we do not address its meaning.3See Securities Act of\n1933, 15 U. S. C. \u00a777v(a); Federal Power Act of 1935, 16\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7825p; Connally Hot Oil Act of 1935, 15\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7715i(c); Natural Gas Act of 1938, 15\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7717u; Trust Indenture Act of 1939, 15\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a777vvv(b); Investment Company Act of 1940, 15\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a780a\u201343; Investment Advisers Act of 1940, 15\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a780b\u201314(a); International Wheat Agreement Act of\n1949, 7 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71642(e); Interstate Land Sales Full\nDisclosure Act of 1968, 15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71719.4The concurrence adopts a\nslightly different approach, placing in federal court Exchange Act\nclaims plusallstate-law claims necessarily raising an\nExchange Act issue. Seepost,at 2\u20133 (Thomas,\u00a0J.,\nconcurring in judgment). In other words, the concurrence would not\nask, as the \u201carising under\u201d test does, whether the federal issue\nembedded in such a state-law claim is also substantial, actually\ndisputed, and capable of resolution in federal court without\ndisrupting the congressionally approved federal-state balance. Seepost,at 6\u20137;Grable & Sons Metal Products,Inc. v.Darue Engineering & Mfg., 545 U.\u00a0S.\n308, 314 (2005) . But this Court has not construed any\njurisdictional statute, whether using the words \u201cbrought to\nenforce\u201d or \u201carising under\u201d (or for that matter, any other), to\ndraw the concurrence\u2019s line. For as long as we have contemplated\nexercising federal jurisdiction over state-law claims necessarily\nraising federal issues, we have inquired as well into whether those\nissues are \u201creally and substantially\u201d disputed. See,e.g.,\nHop-kinsv.Walker,244 U.\u00a0S. 486, 489 (1917) ;Shulthisv.McDougal,225 U.\u00a0S. 561, 569 (1912)\n. And similarly, we have long emphasized the need in such\ncircumstances to make \u201csensitive judgments about congressional\nintent, judicial power, and the federal system.\u201dMerrell Dow\nPharmaceuticals Inc.v.Thompson, 478 U.\u00a0S. 804,\n810 (1986) . At this late juncture, we see no virtue in trying to\npull apart these interconnected strands of necessity and\nsubstantiality-plus. Indeed, doing so here\u2014and thus creating a gap\nbetween our \u201cbrought to enforce\u201d and \u201carising under\u201d\nstandards\u2014would conflict with this Court\u2019s precedent and undermine\nimportant goals of interpreting jurisdictional statutes. Seeinfra, at 10\u201314 (discussing our prior decisions equating the\ntwo tests), 14\u201317 (highlighting the need to respect state courts\nand the benefits of using a single, time-tested\nstandard).5Section 22 grants federal\ncourts exclusive jurisdiction \u201cof all suits in equity and actions\nat law brought to enforce any liability or duty created by\n.\u00a0.\u00a0.
