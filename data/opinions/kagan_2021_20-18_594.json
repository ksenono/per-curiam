But an officer may make a warrantless entry when \u201cthe\nexigencies of the situation\u201d create a compelling law enforcement\nneed.Kentuckyv.King,563 U.S.\n452, 460 (2011). The question presented here is whether the\npursuit of a fleeing misdemeanor suspect always\u2014or more legally\nput, categorically\u2014qualifies as an exigent circumstance. We hold it\ndoes not. A great many misdemeanor pursuits involve exigencies\nallowing warrantless entry. But whether a given one does so turns\non the particular facts of the case.IThis case began when petitioner Arthur Lange\ndrove past a California highway patrol officer in Sonoma. Lange, it\nis fair to say, was asking for attention: He was listening to loud\nmusic with his windows down and repeatedly honking his horn. The\nofficer began to tail Lange, and soon afterward turned on his\noverhead lights to signal that Lange should pull over. By that\ntime, though, Lange was only about a hundred feet (some\nfour-seconds drive) from his home. Rather than stopping, Lange\ncontinued to his driveway and entered his attached garage. The\nofficer followed Lange in and began questioning him. Observing\nsigns of intoxication, the officer put Lange through field sobriety\ntests. Lange did not do well, and a later blood test showed that\nhis blood-alcohol content was more than three times the legal\nlimit.The State charged Lange with the misdemeanor of\ndriving under the influence of alcohol, plus a (lower-level) noise\ninfraction. Lange moved to suppress all evidence obtained after the\nofficer entered his garage, arguing that the warrantless entry had\nviolated the Fourth Amendment. The State contested the motion. It\ncontended that the officer had probable cause to arrest Lange for\nthe misdemeanor of failing to comply with a police signal. See,e.g., Cal. Veh. Code Ann. \u00a72800(a) (West 2015) (making it a\nmisdemeanor to \u201cwillfully fail or refuse to comply with a lawful\norder, signal, or direction of a peace officer\u201d). And it argued\nthat the pursuit of a suspected misdemeanant always qualifies as an\nexigent circumstance authorizing a warrantless home entry. The\nSuperior Court denied Lange\u2019s motion, and its appellate division\naffirmed.The California Court of Appeal also affirmed,\naccepting the State\u2019s argument in full. 2019 WL 5654385, *1 (2019).\nIn the court\u2019s view, Lange\u2019s \u201cfail[ure] to immediately pull over\u201d\nwhen the officer flashed his lights created probable cause to\narrest him for a misdemeanor.Id., at *7. And a misdemeanor\nsuspect, the court stated, could \u201cnot defeat an arrest which has\nbeen set in motion in a public place\u201d by \u201cretreat[ing] into\u201d a\nhouse or other \u201cprivate place.\u201d Seeid., at *6\u2013*8 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). Rather, an \u201cofficer\u2019s \u2018hot pursuit\u2019 into\nthe house to prevent the suspect from frustrating the arrest\u201d is\nalways permissible under the exigent-circumstances \u201cexception to\nthe warrant requirement.\u201dId., at *8 (some internal\nquotation marks omitted). That flat rule resolved the matter:\n\u201cBecause the officer was in hot pursuit\u201d of a misdemeanor suspect,\n\u201cthe officer\u2019s warrantless entry into [the suspect\u2019s] driveway and\ngarage [was] lawful.\u201dId., at *9. The California Supreme\nCourt denied review.Courts are divided over whether the Fourth\nAmendment always permits an officer to enter a home without a\nwarrant in pursuit of a fleeing misdemeanor suspect. Some courts\nhave adopted such a categorical rule, while others have required a\ncase-specific showing of exigency.[1] We granted certiorari, 592 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2020), to\nresolve the conflict. Because California abandoned its defense of\nthe categorical rule applied below in its response to Lange\u2019s\npetition, we appointed Amanda Rice asamicus curiaeto\ndefend the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment. She has ably discharged her\nresponsibilities.IIThe Fourth Amendment provides that \u201c[t]he\nright of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers,\nand effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not\nbe violated.\u201d As that text makes clear, \u201cthe ultimate touchstone of\nthe Fourth Amendment is \u2018reasonableness.\u2019\u00a0\u201dBrigham\nCityv.Stuart,547 U.S.\n398, 403 (2006). That standard \u201cgenerally requires the\nobtaining of a judicial warrant\u201d before a law enforcement officer\ncan enter a home without permission.Rileyv.California,573 U.S.\n373, 382 (2014) (internal quotation marks omitted). But not\nalways: The \u201cwarrant requirement is subject to certain exceptions.\u201dBrigham City, 547 U.\u00a0S., at 403.One important exception is for exigent\ncircumstances. It applies when \u201cthe exigencies of the situation\nmake the needs of law enforcement so compelling that [a]\nwarrantless search is objectively reasonable.\u201dKing, 563\nU.\u00a0S., at 460 (internal quotation marks omitted). The\nexception enables law enforcement officers to handle\n\u201cemergenc[ies]\u201d\u2014situations presenting a \u201ccompelling need for\nofficial action and no time to secure a warrant.\u201dRiley, 573\nU.\u00a0S., at 402;Missouriv.McNeely,569 U.S.\n141, 149 (2013). Over the years, this Court has identified\nseveral such exigencies. An officer, for example, may \u201center a home\nwithout a warrant to render emergency assistance to an injured\noccupant[,] to protect an occupant from imminent injury,\u201d or to\nensure his own safety.Brigham City, 547 U.\u00a0S., at 403;Riley, 573 U.\u00a0S., at 388. So too, the police may make a\nwarrantless entry to \u201cprevent the imminent destruction of evidence\u201d\nor to \u201cprevent a suspect\u2019s escape.\u201dBrigham City, 547\nU.\u00a0S., at 403;Minnesotav.Olson,495 U.S.\n91, 100 (1990) (internal quotation marks omitted). In those\ncircumstances, the delay required to obtain a warrant would bring\nabout \u201csome real immediate and serious consequences\u201d\u2014and so the\nabsence of a warrant is excused.Welshv.Wisconsin,466 U.S.\n740, 751 (1984) (quotingMcDonaldv.United\nStates,335 U.S.\n451, 460 (1948) (Jackson, J., concurring)).Our cases have generally applied the\nexigent-circumstances exception on a \u201ccase-by-case basis.\u201dBirchfieldv.North Dakota, 579 U.S. 438, ___ (2016)\n(slip op., at 16). The exception \u201crequires a court to examine\nwhether an emergency justified a warrantless search in each\nparticular case.\u201dRiley, 573 U.\u00a0S., at 402. Or put more\ncurtly, the exception is \u201ccase-specific.\u201dId., at 388. That\napproach reflects the nature of emergencies. Whether a \u201cnow or\nnever situation\u201d actually exists\u2014whether an officer has \u201cno time to\nsecure a warrant\u201d\u2014depends upon facts on the ground.Id., at\n391 (internal quotation marks omitted);McNeely, 569\nU.\u00a0S., at 149 (internal quotation marks omitted). So the\nissue, we have thought, is most naturally considered by \u201clook[ing]\nto the totality of circumstances\u201d confronting the officer as he\ndecides to make a warrantless entry.Id., at 149.The question here is whether to use that\napproach, or instead apply a categorical warrant exception, when a\nsuspected misdemeanant flees from police into his home. Under the\nusual case-specific view, an officer can follow the misdemeanant\nwhen, but only when, an exigency\u2014for example, the need to prevent\ndestruction of evidence\u2014allows insufficient time to get a warrant.\nThe appointedamicusasks us to replace that case-by-case\nassessment with a flat (and sweeping) rule finding exigency in\nevery case of misdemeanor pursuit. In her view, those \u201centries are\ncategorically reasonable, regardless of whether\u201d any risk of harm\n(like, again, destruction of evidence) \u201cmaterializes in a\nparticular case.\u201d Brief for Court-AppointedAmicus Curiae31. The fact of flight from the officer, she says, is itself enough\nto justify a warrantless entry. (The principal concurrence agrees.)\nTo assess that position, we look (as we often do in Fourth\nAmendment cases) both to this Court\u2019s precedents and to the\ncommon-law practices familiar to the Framers.AThe place to start is with our often-stated\nview of the constitutional interest at stake: the sanctity of a\nperson\u2019s living space. \u201c[W]hen it comes to the Fourth Amendment,\nthe home is first among equals.\u201dFloridav.Jardines,569 U.S.\n1, 6 (2013). At the Amendment\u2019s \u201cvery core,\u201d we have said,\n\u201cstands the right of a man to retreat into his own home and there\nbe free from unreasonable government intrusion.\u201dCollinsv.Virginia, 584 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2018) (slip op., at 5)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Or again: \u201cFreedom\u201d in one\u2019s\nown \u201cdwelling is the archetype of the privacy protection secured by\nthe Fourth Amendment\u201d; conversely, \u201cphysical entry of the home is\nthe chief evil against which [it] is directed.\u201dPaytonv.New York,445 U.S.\n573, 585, 587 (1980) (internal quotation marks omitted). The\nAmendment thus \u201cdraw[s] a firm line at the entrance to the house.\u201dId., at 590. What lies behind that line is of course not\ninviolable. An officer may always enter a home with a proper\nwarrant. And as just described, exigent circumstances allow even\nwarrantless intrusions. Seeibid.;supra, at 4. But\nthe contours of that or any other warrant exception permitting home\nentry are \u201cjealously and carefully drawn,\u201d in keeping with the\n\u201ccenturies-old principle\u201d that the \u201chome is entitled to special\nprotection.\u201dGeorgiav.Randolph,547 U.S.\n103, 109, 115 (2006) (internal quotation marks omitted); seeCanigliav.Strom, 593 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2021)\n(slip op., at 4) (\u201c[T]his Court has repeatedly declined to expand\nthe scope\u201d of \u201cexceptions to the warrant requirement to permit\nwarrantless entry into the home\u201d). So we are not eager\u2014more the\nreverse\u2014to print a new permission slip for entering the home\nwithout a warrant.Theamicusargues, though, that we have\nalready created the rule she advocates. InUnited Statesv.Santana,427 U.S.\n38(1976), the main case she relies on, police officers drove\nto Dominga Santana\u2019s house with probable cause to think that\nSantana was dealing drugs, a felony under the applicable law. When\nthe officers pulled up, they saw Santana standing in her home\u2019s\nopen doorway, some 15 feet away. As they got out of the van and\nyelled \u201cpolice,\u201d Santana \u201cretreated into [the house\u2019s] vestibule.\u201dId., at 40. The officers followed her in, and discovered\nheroin. We upheld the warrantless entry as one involving a police\n\u201chot pursuit,\u201d even though the chase \u201cended almost as soon as it\nbegan.\u201dId., at 43. Citing \u201ca realistic expectation that any\ndelay would result in destruction of evidence,\u201d we recognized the\nofficers\u2019 \u201cneed to act quickly.\u201dId., at 42\u201343. But we\nframed our holding in broader terms: Santana\u2019s \u201cact of retreating\ninto her house,\u201d we stated, could \u201cnot defeat an arrest\u201d that had\n\u201cbeen set in motion in a public place.\u201dIbid. Theamicustakes that statement to support a flat rule\npermitting warrantless home entry when police officers (with\nprobable cause) are pursuing any suspect\u2014whether a felon or a\nmisdemeanant. See Brief forAmicus Curiae11, 26. For\nsupport, she points to a number of later decisions describingSantanain dicta as allowing warrantless home entries when\npolice are \u201cin \u2018hot pursuit\u2019 of a fugitive\u201d or \u201ca fleeing suspect.\u201dE.g.,Steagaldv.United States,451 U.S.\n204, 221 (1981);King, 563 U.\u00a0S., at 460. The\nconcurrence echoes her arguments.We disagree with that broad understanding ofSantana, as we have suggested before. In rejecting theamicus\u2019s view, we see no need to consider Lange\u2019s\ncounterargument thatSantanadid not establishanycategorical rule\u2014even one for fleeing felons. See Brief for\nPetitioner 7, 25 (contending thatSantanais \u201centirely\nconsistent\u201d with \u201ccase-by-case exigency analysis\u201d because the Court\n\u201ccarefully based [its] holding on [the] specific facts\u201d and\n\u201ccircumstances\u201d). AssumingSantanatreated fleeing-felon\ncases categorically (that is, asalwayspresenting exigent\ncircumstances allowing warrantless entry), see,e.g.,Stantonv.Sims,571 U.S.\n3, 8 (2013) (per curiam);McNeely, 569\nU.\u00a0S., at 149;King, 563 U.\u00a0S., at 450, it still\nsaid nothing about fleeing misdemeanants. We said as much inStanton, when we approved qualified immunity for an officer\nwho had pursued a suspected misdemeanant into a home. Describing\nthe same split of authority we took this case to address, we stated\nthat \u201cthe law regarding warrantless entry in hot pursuit of a\nfleeing misdemeanant is not clearly established\u201d (so that the\nofficer could not be held liable for damages). 571 U.\u00a0S., at\n6, 10. In other words, we found that neitherSantananor any\nother decision had resolved the matter one way or the other. And we\nleft things in that unsettled state. See 571 U.\u00a0S., at 10.Santana, we noted, addressed a police pursuit \u201cinvolv[ing] a\nfelony suspect,\u201d 571 U.\u00a0S., at 9; whether the same approach\ngoverned a misdemeanor chase was an issue for a future case.Key to resolving that issue are two facts about\nmisdemeanors: They vary widely, but they may be (in a word)\n\u201cminor.\u201dWelsh, 466 U.\u00a0S., at 750. In California and\nelsewhere, misdemeanors run the gamut of seriousness. As theamicusnotes, some involve violence. California, for\nexample, classifies as misdemeanors various forms of assault. See\nCal. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7241 (West Cum. Supp. 2021); Brief forAmicus Curiae15a\u201316a. And across the country, \u201cmany\nperpetrators of domestic violence are charged with misdemeanors,\u201d\ndespite \u201cthe harmfulness of their conduct.\u201dVoisinev.United States, 579 U.S. 686, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 1). So\n\u201ca \u2018felon\u2019 is\u201d not always \u201cmore dangerous than a misdemeanant.\u201dTennesseev.Garner,471 U.S.\n1, 14 (1985). But calling an offense a misdemeanor usually\nlimits prison time to one year. See 1 W. LaFave, J. Israel, N.\nKing, & O. Kerr, Criminal Procedure \u00a71.8(c) (4th ed. Supp.\n2020). States thus tend to apply that label to less violent and\nless dangerous crimes. In California, it is a misdemeanor to litter\non a public beach. See Cal. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7374.7(a) (2020). And\nto \u201cnegligently cut\u201d a plant \u201cgrowing upon public land.\u201d\n\u00a7384a(a)(2), (f\u00a0). And to \u201cwillfully disturb[\u00a0] another\nperson by loud and unreasonable noise.\u201d \u00a7415(2). And (last one) to\n\u201cartificially color[\u00a0] any live chicks [or] rabbits.\u201d \u00a7599(b).\nIn forbidding such conduct, California is no outlier. Most States\ncount as misdemeanors such offenses as traffic violations, public\nintoxication, and disorderly conduct. See,e.g., Tex.\nTransp. Code Ann. \u00a7545.413(a), (d) (West 2011) (driving without a\nseatbelt); Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 610, \u00a790/1 (West 2018) (drinking\nalcohol in a railroad car); Ark. Code Ann. \u00a75\u201371\u2013207(a)(3), (b)\n(2016) (using obscene language likely to promote disorder). So theamicus\u2019s (and concurrence\u2019s) rule would cover lawbreakers of\nevery type, including quite a few hard to think alarming.This Court has held that when a minor offense\nalone is involved, police officers do not usually face the kind of\nemergency that can justify a warrantless home entry. InWelsh, officers responded to a call about a drunk driver\nonly to discover he had abandoned his vehicle and walked home. See\n466 U.\u00a0S., at 742\u2013743. So no police pursuit was necessary, hot\nor otherwise. The officers just went to the driver\u2019s house, entered\nwithout a warrant, and arrested him for a \u201cnonjailable\u201d offense.Ibid. The State contended that exigent circumstances\nsupported the entry because the driver\u2019s \u201cblood-alcohol level might\nhave dissipated while the police obtained a warrant.\u201dId.,\nat 754. We rejected that argument on the ground that the driver had\nbeen charged with only a minor offense. \u201c[T]he gravity of the\nunderlying offense,\u201d we reasoned, is \u201can important factor to be\nconsidered when determining whether any exigency exists.\u201dId., at 753. \u201c[W]hen only a minor offense has been\ncommitted\u201d (again, without any flight), there is reason to question\nwhether a compelling law enforcement need is present; so it is\n\u201cparticularly appropriate\u201d to \u201chesitat[e] in finding exigent\ncircumstances.\u201dId., at 750. And we concluded:\n\u201c[A]pplication of the exigent-circumstances exception in the\ncontext of a home entry should rarely be sanctioned when there is\nprobable cause to believe that only a minor offense\u201d is involved.Id., at 753.[2]Add a suspect\u2019s flight and the calculus\nchanges\u2014but not enough to justify theamicus\u2019s categorical\nrule. We have no doubt that in a great many cases flight creates a\nneed for police to act swiftly. A suspect may flee, for example,\nbecause he is intent on discarding evidence. Or his flight may show\na willingness to flee yet again, while the police await a warrant.\nBut no evidence suggests that every case of misdemeanor flight\nposes such dangers. Recall that misdemeanors can target minor,\nnon-violent conduct. Seesupra, at 8\u20139.Welshheld\nthat when that is so, officers can probably take the time to get a\nwarrant. And at times that will be true even when a misdemeanant\nhas forced the police to pursue him (especially given that\n\u201cpursuit\u201d may cover just a few feet of ground, seesupra, at\n6). Those suspected of minor offenses may flee for innocuous\nreasons and in non-threatening ways. Consider from the casebooks:\nthe man with a mental disability who, in response to officers\nasking him about \u201cfidgeting with [a] mailbox,\u201d retreated in \u201ca\nhurried manner\u201d to his nearby home.Carrollv.Ellington, 800 F.3d 154, 162 (CA5 2015). Or the teenager\n\u201cdriving without taillights\u201d who on seeing a police signal \u201cdid not\nstop but drove two blocks to his parents\u2019 house, ran inside, and\nhid in the bathroom.\u201dMascorrov.Billings, 656 F.3d\n1198, 1202 (CA10 2011). In such a case, waiting for a warrant is\nunlikely to hinder a compelling law enforcement need. Seeid., at 1207 (\u201cThe risk of flight or escape was somewhere\nbetween low and nonexistent[,] there was no evidence which could\nhave potentially been destroyed[,] and there were no officer or\npublic safety concerns\u201d). Those non-emergency situations may be\natypical. But they reveal the overbreadth\u2014fatal in this context\u2014of\ntheamicus\u2019s (and concurrence\u2019s) rule, which would treat a\ndangerous offender and the scared teenager the same. In misdemeanor\ncases, flight does not always supply the exigency that this Court\nhas demanded for a warrantless home entry.Our Fourth Amendment precedents thus point\ntoward assessing case by case the exigencies arising from\nmisdemeanants\u2019 flight. That approach will in many, if not most,\ncases allow a warrantless home entry. When the totality of\ncircumstances shows an emergency\u2014such as imminent harm to others, a\nthreat to the officer himself, destruction of evidence, or escape\nfrom the home\u2014the police may act without waiting. And those\ncircumstances, as described just above, include the flight\nitself.[3] But the need to\npursue a misdemeanant does not trigger a categorical rule allowing\nhome entry, even absent a law enforcement emergency. When the\nnature of the crime, the nature of the flight, and surrounding\nfacts present no such exigency, officers must respect the sanctity\nof the home\u2014which means that they must get a warrant.BThe common law in place at the Constitution\u2019s\nfounding leads to the same conclusion. That law, we have many times\nsaid, may be \u201cinstructive in determining what sorts of searches the\nFramers of the Fourth Amendment regarded as reasonable.\u201dE.g.,Steagald, 451 U.\u00a0S., at 217. And the\nFramers\u2019 view provides a baseline for our own day: The Amendment\n\u201cmust provideat a minimumthe degree of protection it\nafforded when it was adopted.\u201dUnited Statesv.Jones,565 U.S.\n400, 411 (2012); seeJardines, 569 U.\u00a0S., at 5.\nSometimes, no doubt, the common law of the time is hard to figure\nout: The historical record does not reveal a limpid legal rule.\nSee,e.g.,Payton, 445 U.\u00a0S., at 592\u2013597. Here,\nwe find it challenging to map every particular of the common law\u2019s\ntreatment of warrantless home entries. But the evidence is clear on\nthe question before us: The common law did not recognize a\ncategorical rule enabling such an entry in every case of\nmisdemeanor pursuit.Like our modern precedents, the common law\nafforded the home strong protection from government intrusion. As\nthis Court once wrote: \u201cThe zealous and frequent repetition of the\nadage that a \u2018man\u2019s house is his castle\u2019 made it abundantly clear\nthat both in England and in the Colonies \u2018the freedom of one\u2019s\nhouse\u2019 was one of the most vital elements of English liberty.\u201dId., at 596\u2013597 (footnote omitted); seeSemayne\u2019s\nCase, 5 Co. Rep. 91a, 91b, 77 Eng. Rep. 194, 195 (K. B. 1604)\n(\u201c[T]he house of every one is as to him as his castle and fortress,\nas well for his defen[s]e against injury and violence, as for his\nrepose\u201d (footnote omitted)); 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the\nLaws of England 288 (1768) (\u201c[E]very man\u2019s house is looked upon by\nthe law to be his castle of defen[s]e and asylum\u201d).[4] To protect that interest, \u201cprominent law\nlords, the Court of Common Pleas, the Court of King\u2019s Bench,\nParliament,\u201d and leading treatise writers all \u201cc[a]me to embrace\u201d\nthe \u201cunderstanding\u201d that generally \u201ca warrant must issue\u201d before a\ngovernment official could enter a house. Donohue, The Original\nFourth Amendment, 83 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1181, 1238\u20131239 (2016); see\nDavies, Recovering the Original Fourth Amendment, 98 Mich. L. Rev.\n547, 642\u2013646 (1999). That did not mean the Crown got the message;\nits officers often asserted power to intrude into any home they\npleased\u2014thus adding to the colonists\u2019 list of grievances. SeeSteagald, 451 U.\u00a0S., at 220. But the law on the books\noffered a different model: \u201cTo enter a man\u2019s house\u201d without a\nproper warrant, Lord Chief Justice Pratt proclaimed in 1763, is to\nattack \u201cthe liberty of the subject\u201d and \u201cdestroy the liberty of the\nkingdom.\u201dHucklev.Money, 2 Wils. K. B. 206, 207, 95\nEng. Rep. 768, 769 (K. B. 1763). That was the idea behind the\nFourth Amendment.There was an oft-discussed exception: An\nofficer, according to the day\u2019s treatises, could enter a house to\npursue a felon. The felony category then was a good deal narrower\nthan now. Many modern felonies were \u201cclassified as misdemeanors\u201d at\ncommon law, with the felony label mostly reserved for crimes\n\u201cpunishable by death.\u201dGarner, 471 U.\u00a0S., at 13\u201314; see\n4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 98 (1791)\n(Blackstone). In addressing those serious crimes, the law \u201callow[ed\nof] extremities\u201d to meet \u201cnecessity.\u201d R. Burn, The Justice of the\nPeace, and Parish Officer 86 (6th ed. 1758). So if a person\nsuspected \u201cupon probable grounds\u201d of a felony \u201cfly and take house,\u201d\nSir Matthew Hale opined, then \u201cthe constable may break open the\ndoor, tho he have no warrant.\u201d 2 Pleas of the Crown 91\u201392 (1736)\n(Hale). Sergeant William Hawkins set out a more restrictive rule in\nhis widely read treatise. He wrote that a constable, \u201cwith or\nwithout a warrant,\u201d could \u201cbreak open doors\u201d if \u201cpursu[ing]\u201d a\nperson \u201cknown to have committed\u201d a felony\u2014but not if the person was\nonly \u201cunder a probable suspicion.\u201d 2 Pleas of the Crown 138\u2013139\n(1787) (Hawkins). On the other hand, Sir William Blackstone went\nbroader than Hale. A constable, he thought, could \u201cbreak open\ndoors\u201d\u2014no less than \u201cupon a justice\u2019s warrant\u201d\u2014if he had \u201cprobable\nsuspicion [to] arrest [a] felon,\u201d even absent flight or pursuit.\nBlackstone 292. The commentators thus differed on the scope of the\nfelony exception to the warrant requirement. But they agreed on one\nthing: It was indeed afelonyexception. All their rules\napplied to felonies as a class, and to no other whole class of\ncrimes.In the misdemeanor context, officers had more\nlimited authority to intrude on a fleeing suspect\u2019s home.[5] Once again, some of the specifics\nare uncertain, and commentators did not always agree with each\nother. But none suggested any kind of all-misdemeanor-flight rule.\nInstead, their approval of entry turned on the circumstances. One\nset of cases involved what might be called pre-felonies. Blackstone\nexplained that \u201cbreak[ing] open doors\u201d was allowable not only \u201cin\ncase of [a] felony\u201d but also in case of \u201ca dangerous wounding\nwhereby [a] felony is likely to ensue.\u201dIbid.In other\nwords, the felony rule extended to crimes that would become\nfelonies if the victims died. See Hale 94.[6] Another set of cases involved crimes, mostly violent\nthemselves, liable to provoke felonious acts. Often called\n\u201caffrays\u201d or \u201cbreaches of the peace,\u201d a typical example was \u201cthe\nfighting of two or more persons\u201d to \u201cthe terror of his majesty\u2019s\nsubjects.\u201d Blackstone 145, 150.[7] Because that conduct created a \u201cdanger of\nfelony\u201d\u2014because when it occurred, \u201cthere is likely to be\nmanslaughter or bloodshed committed\u201d\u2014\u201cthe constable may break open\nthe doors to keep the peace.\u201d Hale 90, 95 (emphasis deleted); see\nHawkins 139 (blessing a warrantless entry \u201cwhere those who have\nmade an affray in [the constable\u2019s] presence fly to a house and are\nimmediately pursued\u201d). Hale also approved a warrantless entry to\nstop a more mundane form of harm: He (though not other\ncommentators) thought a constable could act to \u201csuppress the\ndisorder\u201d associated with \u201cdrinking or noise in a house at an\nunseasonable time of night.\u201d Hale 95. But differences aside, all\nthe commentators focused on the facts of cases: When a suspected\nmisdemeanant, fleeing or otherwise, threatened no harm, the\nconstable had to get a warrant.The common law thus does not support a\ncategorical rule allowing warrantless home entry when a\nmisdemeanant flees. It had a rule of that kind for felonies. But\nmuch as inWelshcenturies later, the common law made\ndistinctions based on \u201cthe gravity of the underlying offense.\u201d 466\nU.\u00a0S., at 753. When it came to misdemeanors, flight alone was\nnot enough. Whether a constable could make a warrantless entry\ndepended as well on other circumstances suggesting a potential for\nharm and a need to act promptly.[8] In that way, the common-law rules (even if sometimes\nhard to discern with precision) mostly mirror our modern caselaw.\nThe former too demanded\u2014and often found\u2014a law enforcement exigency\nbefore an officer could \u201cbreak open\u201d a fleeing misdemeanant\u2019s\ndoors. Blackstone 292.IIIThe flight of a suspected misdemeanant does\nnot always justify a warrantless entry into a home. An officer must\nconsider all the circumstances in a pursuit case to determine\nwhether there is a law enforcement emergency. On many occasions,\nthe officer will have good reason to enter\u2014to prevent imminent\nharms of violence, destruction of evidence, or escape from the\nhome. But when the officer has time to get a warrant, he must do\nso\u2014even though the misdemeanant fled.Because the California Court of Appeal applied\nthe categorical rule we reject today, we vacate its judgment and\nremand the case for further proceedings not inconsistent with this\nopinion.It is so ordered.Notes1Compare,e.g.,\n2019 WL 5654385, *7\u2013*8 (case below) (applying a categorical rule);Bismarckv.Brekhus, 2018 ND 84, \u00b6 27, 908 N.W.2d\n715, 719\u2013720 (same);Commonwealthv.Jewett, 471\nMass. 624, 634\u2013635, 31 N.\u00a0E. 3d 1079, 1089 (2015) (same);Peoplev.Wear, 229 Ill. 2d 545, 568, 571, 893 N.E.2d\n631, 644\u2013646 (2008) (same);Middletownv.Flinchum,\n95 Ohio St. 3d 43, 44\u201345, 765 N.E.2d 330, 332 (2002) (same);Statev.Ricci, 144 N.\u00a0H. 241, 244\u2013245, 739 A.2d\n404, 407\u2013408 (1999) (same), with,e.g.,Statev.Markus, 211 So. 3d 894, 906\u2013907 (Fla. 2017) (requiring a\ncase-specific showing);Mascorrov.Billings, 656\nF.3d 1198, 1207 (CA10 2011) (same);Butlerv.State,\n309 Ark. 211, 216\u2013217,829 S.W.2d 412,415(1992) (same);Statev.Bolte, 115 N.\u00a0J.\n579, 597\u2013598,560 A.2d 644, 654\u2013655 (1989) (same); see alsoStantonv.Sims,571 U.S.\n3, 6\u20137 (2013) (per curiam) (noting the\nsplit).2The concurrence is wrong\nto say thatWelshapplies only to nonjailable offenses, and\nnot to minor crimes that are labeled misdemeanors. Seepost,\nat 12\u201313 (Roberts, C.\u00a0J., concurring in judgment). No less\nthan four times,Welshframed its holding as applying to\n\u201cminor offenses\u201d generally. 466 U.\u00a0S., at 750, 752\u2013753. (By\ncontrast, the word \u201cnonjailable\u201d does not appear in its legal\nanalysis.) The decision cited lower court cases prohibiting\nwarrantless home entries when the defendant had committed a\nmisdemeanor. Seeid., at 752. And its essential rationale\napplies to all minor crimes, however labeled. As the Court stated\n(quoting an earlier Justice Jackson opinion): It would\n\u201cdisplay[\u00a0] a shocking lack of all sense of proportion\u201d to say\nthat \u201cprivate homes, even quarters in a tenement, may be\nindiscriminately invaded at the discretion of any suspicious police\nofficer engaged in following up offenses that involve no violence\nor threats of it.\u201dId., at 751 (quotingMcDonaldv.United States,335 U.S.\n451, 459 (1948) (concurring opinion)).3Given that our rule\nallows warrantless home entry when emergencies like these exist, we\nthink the concurrence\u2019s alarmism misplaced. See,e.g.,post, at 2 (opinion of Roberts, C.\u00a0J.) (bewailing\n\u201cdanger[\u00a0]\u201d and \u201cabsurd[ity]\u201d). The concurrence spends most of\nits time worrying about cases in which there are exigencies above\nand beyond the flight itself: when, for example, the fleeing\nmisdemeanant will \u201cget a gun and take aim from inside\u201d or \u201cflush\ndrugs down the toilet.\u201dPost, at 2, 8. But again: When an\nofficer reasonably believes those exigencies exist, he does not\nneed a categorical misdemeanor-pursuit rule to justify a\nwarrantless home entry. (And contrary to the concurrence\u2019s\nunder-explained suggestion, seepost, at 7\u20138, assessing\nexigencies is no harder in this context than in any other.) The\nonly cases in which we and the concurrence reach a different result\nare cases involving flight alone, without exigencies like the\ndestruction of evidence, violence to others, or escape from the\nhome. It is telling that\u2014although they are our sole\ndisagreement\u2014the concurrence hardly talks about those \u201cflight\nalone\u201d cases. Apparently, it taxes even the concurrence to justify\nas an \u201cexigency\u201d a warrantless entry based only on a misdemeanant\u2019s\nprior retreat into his home\u2014when the police officers do not\nreasonably believe anything harmful will happen in the time it\ntakes to get a warrant.4In a 1763 Parliamentary\ndebate, about searches made to enforce a tax, William Pitt the\nElder orated as follows: \u201cThe poorest man may in his cottage bid\ndefiance to all the forces of the Crown. It may be frail; its roof\nmay shake; the wind may blow through it; the storm may enter; the\nrain may enter; but the King of England cannot enter\u2014all his force\ndares not cross the threshold of the ruined tenement!\u201dMillerv.United States,357\nU.S. 301, 307, and n.\u00a07 (1958) (citing The Oxford\nDictionary of Quotations 379 (2d ed. 1953); 15 T. Hansard,\nParliamentary History of England, col. 1307 (1813)).5Note, though, that if a\nperson had already been arrested and then escaped from custody, an\nofficer could always search for him at home. See 2 W. Hawkins,\nPleas of the Crown 87 (1721).6Both felonies and\npre-felonies justified the common law\u2019s \u201chue and cry\u201d: when a\nconstable or other person \u201craise[d] the power of the towne\u201d\u2014\u201cwith\nhorn and with voice\u201d\u2014to pursue an offender. 3 E. Coke, Institutes\nof the Laws of England 116 (1644); Blackstone 293. Most of the\ncommon-law authorities approved warrantless home entries upon a hue\nand cry. But because that process was generally available only to\napprehend felons and those who had \u201cdangerously wounded any\nperson,\u201d it did not enlarge the range of qualifying offenses. Hale\n98; see Brief for Constitutional Accountability Center asAmicus\nCuriae17\u201318.7The term \u201cbreach of the\npeace\u201d can today encompass many kinds of behavior, and even in\ncommon-law times it \u201cmeant very different things in different\u201d\ncontexts.Atwaterv.Lago Vista,532 U.S.\n318, 327, n.\u00a02 (2001). But \u201c[m]ore often than not, when\nused in reference to common-law arrest power, the term seemed to\nconnote an element of violence.\u201dId., at 327\u2013328,\nn.\u00a02.8The concurrence professes\nto disagree with this conclusion, seepost, at 17\u201319\n(opinion of Roberts, C. J.), but its account of the common law ends\nup in much the same place as ours. The concurrence recognizes a\ncategorical rule permitting warrantless home entry in pursuit of\nfleeing felons. Seepost, at 17. But for misdemeanants, the\nconcurrence presents only discrete circumstances\u2014mostly the same as\nours\u2014allowing home entry without a warrant.Post, at\n17\u201318.Those particular instances of permissible entry do\nnot create a categorical rule.",
