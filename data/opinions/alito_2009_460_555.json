S. ____ (2009)SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESNO. 07-665PLEASANT GROVE CITY, UTAH, et\u00a0al., PETITIONERSv.SUMMUMon writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the tenth circuit[February 25, 2009]Justice Alito delivered the\nopinion of the Court.This case presents the question\nwhether the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment entitles a\nprivate group to insist that a municipality permit it to place a\npermanent monument in a city park in which other donated monuments\nwere previously erected. The Court of Appeals held that the\nmunicipality was required to accept the monument because a public\npark is a traditional public forum. We conclude, however, that\nalthough a park is a traditional public forum for speeches and\nother transitory expressive acts, the display of a permanent\nmonument in a public park is not a form of expression to which\nforum analysis applies. Instead, the placement of a permanent\nmonument in a public park is best viewed as a form of government\nspeech and is therefore not subject to scrutiny under the Free\nSpeech Clause.IAPioneer Park (or Park) is a 2.5\nacre public park located in the Historic District of Pleasant Grove\nCity (or City) in Utah. The Park currently contains 15 permanent\ndisplays, at least 11 of which were donated by private groups or\nindividuals. These include an historic granary, a wishing well, the\nCity\u2019s first fire station, a September 11 monument, and a Ten\nCommandments monument donated by the Fraternal Order of Eagles in\n1971.Respondent Summum is a religious\norganization founded in 1975 and headquartered in Salt Lake City,\nUtah. On two separate occasions in 2003, Summum\u2019s president wrote a\nletter to the City\u2019s mayor requesting permission to erect a \u201cstone\nmonument,\u201d which would contain \u201cthe Seven Aphorisms of\nSUMMUM\u201d[Footnote 1] and be\nsimilar in size and nature to the Ten Commandments monument. App.\n57, 59. The City denied the requests and explained that its\npractice was to limit monuments in the Park to those that \u201ceither\n(1) directly relate to the history of Pleasant Grove, or (2) were\ndonated by groups with longstanding ties to the Pleasant Grove\ncommunity.\u201dId., at 61. The following year, the City\npassed a resolution putting this policy into writing. The\nresolution also mentioned other criteria, such as safety and\nesthetics.In May 2005, respondent\u2019s president again\nwrote to the mayor asking to erect a monument, but the letter did\nnot describe the monument, its historical significance, or Summum\u2019s\nconnection to the community. The city council rejected this\nrequest.BIn 2005, respondent filed this\naction against the City and various local officials (petitioners),\nasserting, among other claims, that petitioners had violated the\nFree Speech Clause of the First Amendment by accepting the Ten\nCommandments monument but rejecting the proposed Seven Aphorisms\nmonument. Respondent sought a preliminary injunction directing the\nCity to permit Summum to erect its monument in Pioneer Park. After\nthe District Court denied Summum\u2019s preliminary injunction request,\nNo. 2:05CV00638, 2006 WL 3421838 (D Utah, Nov. 22, 2006),\nrespondent appealed, pressing solely its free speech claim.A panel of the Tenth Circuit reversed. 483\nF.\u00a03d 1044 (2007). The panel noted that it had previously\nfound the Ten Commandments monument to be private rather than\ngovernment speech. SeeSummumv.Ogden, 297\nF.\u00a03d 995 (2002). Noting that public parks have traditionally\nbeen regarded as public forums, the panel held that the City could\nnot reject the Seven Aphorisms monument unless it had a compelling\njustification that could not be served by more narrowly tailored\nmeans. See 483 F.\u00a03d, at 1054. The panel then concluded that\nthe exclusion of respondent\u2019s monument was unlikely to survive this\nstrict scrutiny, and the panel therefore held that the City was\nrequired to erect Summum\u2019s monument immediately.The Tenth Circuit denied the\nCity\u2019s petition for rehearing en banc by an equally divided vote.\n499 F.\u00a03d 1170 (2007). Judge Lucero dissented, arguing that\nthe Park was not a traditional public forum for the purpose of\ndisplaying monuments.Id., at 1171. Judge McConnell also\ndissented, contending that the monuments in the Park constitute\ngovernment speech.Id., at 1174.We granted certiorari, 552 U. S. ___ (2008),\nand now reverse.IINo prior decision of this Court\nhas addressed the application of the Free Speech Clause to a\ngovernment entity\u2019s acceptance of privately donated, permanent\nmonuments for installation in a public park, and the parties\ndisagree sharply about the line of precedents that governs this\nsituation. Petitioners contend that the pertinent cases are those\nconcerning government speech. Respondent, on the other hand, agrees\nwith the Court of Appeals panel that the applicable cases are those\nthat analyze private speech in a public forum. The parties\u2019\nfundamental disagreement thus centers on the nature of petitioners\u2019\nconduct when they permitted privately donated monuments to be\nerected in Pioneer Park. Were petitioners engaging in their own\nexpressive conduct? Or were they providing a forum for private\nspeech?AIf petitioners were engaging in\ntheir own expressive conduct, then the Free Speech Clause has no\napplication. The Free Speech Clause restricts government regulation\nof private speech; it does not regulate government speech. SeeJohannsv.Livestock Marketing Assn.,544 U. S. 550, 553\n(2005) (\u201c[T]he Government\u2019s own speech . . . is exempt from First\nAmendment scrutiny\u201d);Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc.v.Democratic National Committee,412 U. S. 94, 139,\nn.\u00a07 (1973) (Stewart, J., concurring) (\u201cGovernment is not\nrestrained by the First Amendment from controlling its own\nexpression\u201d). A government entity has the right to \u201cspeak for\nitself.\u201dBoard of Regents of Univ. of Wis. Systemv.Southworth,529 U. S. 217, 229\n(2000). \u201c[I]t is entitled to say what it wishes,\u201dRosenbergerv.Rector and Visitors of Univ. of\nVa.,515 U. S.\n819, 833 (1995), and to select the views that it wants to\nexpress. SeeRustv.Sullivan,500 U. S. 173, 194\n(1991);National Endowment for Artsv.Finley,524 U. S. 569,\n598 (1998) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment) (\u201cIt is the very\nbusiness of government to favor and disfavor points of view\u201d).Indeed, it is not easy to imagine\nhow government could function if it lacked this freedom. \u201cIf every\ncitizen were to have a right to insist that no one paid by public\nfunds express a view with which he disagreed, debate over issues of\ngreat concern to the public would be limited to those in the\nprivate sector, and the process of government as we know it\nradically transformed.\u201dKellerv.State Bar of\nCal.,496 U. S.\n1, 12\u201313 (1990). See alsoJohanns, 544 U. S., at 574\n(Souter, J., dissenting) (\u201cTo govern, government has to say\nsomething, and a First Amendment heckler\u2019s veto of any forced\ncontribution to raising the government\u2019s voice in the \u2018marketplace\nof ideas\u2019 would be out of the question\u201d (footnote omitted)).A government entity may exercise this same\nfreedom to express its views when it receives assistance from\nprivate sources for the purpose of delivering a\ngovernment-controlled message. Seeid., at 562 (opinion of\nthe Court) (where the government controls the message, \u201cit is not\nprecluded from relying on the government-speech doctrine merely\nbecause it solicits assistance from nongovernmental sources\u201d);Rosenberger,supra, at 833 (a government entity\nmay \u201cregulate the content of what is or is not expressed \u2026 when it\nenlists private entities to convey its own message\u201d).This does not mean that there are no\nrestraints on government speech. For example, government speech\nmust comport with the Establishment Clause. The involvement of\npublic officials in advocacy may be limited by law, regulation, or\npractice. And of course, a government entity is ultimately\n\u201caccountable to the electorate and the political process for its\nadvocacy.\u201dSouthworth, 529 U. S., at 235. \u201cIf the\ncitizenry objects, newly elected officials later could espouse some\ndifferent or contrary position.\u201dIbid.BWhile government\nspeech is not restricted by the Free Speech Clause, the government\ndoes not have a free hand to regulate private speech on government\nproperty. This Court long ago recognized that members of the public\nretain strong free speech rights when they venture into public\nstreets and parks, \u201cwhich \u2018have immemorially been held in trust for\nthe use of the public and, time out of mind, have been used for\npurposes of assembly, communicating thoughts between citizens, and\ndiscussing public questions.\u2019\u00a0\u201dPerry Ed. Assn.v.Perry Local Educators\u2019 Assn.,460 U. S. 37, 45 (1983)\n(quotingHaguev.Committee for Industrial\nOrganization,307 U. S. 496, 515\n(1939) (opinion of Roberts, J.)). In order to preserve this\nfreedom, government entities are strictly limited in their ability\nto regulate private speech in such \u201ctraditional public fora.\u201dCorneliusv.NAACP Legal Defense & Ed. Fund,\nInc.,473 U. S.\n788, 800 (1985). Reasonable time, place, and manner\nrestrictions are allowed, seePerry Ed. Assn.,supra, at 45, but any restriction based on the content of\nthe speech must satisfy strict scrutiny, that is, the restriction\nmust be narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government\ninterest, seeCornelius,supra, at 800, and\nrestrictions based on viewpoint are prohibited, seeCareyv.Brown,447 U. S. 455, 463\n(1980).With the concept of\nthe traditional public forum as a starting point, this Court has\nrecognized that members of the public have free speech rights on\nother types of government property and in certain other government\nprograms that share essential attributes of a traditional public\nforum. We have held that a government entity may create \u201ca\ndesignated public forum\u201d if government property that has not\ntraditionally been regarded as a public forum is intentionally\nopened up for that purpose. SeeCornelius, 473 U. S., at\n802. Government restrictions on speech in a designated public forum\nare subject to the same strict scrutiny as restrictions in a\ntraditional public forum.Id., at 800.The Court has also held that a\ngovernment entity may create a forum that is limited to use by\ncertain groups or dedicated solely to the discussion of certain\nsubjects.Perry Ed. Assn.,supra, at 46,\nn.\u00a07. In such a forum, a government entity may impose\nrestrictions on speech that are reasonable and viewpoint-neutral.\nSeeGood News Clubv.Milford Central School,533 U. S. 98,\n106\u2013107 (2001).IIIThere may be\nsituations in which it is difficult to tell whether a government\nentity is speaking on its own behalf or is providing a forum for\nprivate speech, but this case does not present such a situation.\nPermanent monuments displayed on public property typically\nrepresent government speech.Governments have long\nused monuments to speak to the public. Since ancient times, kings,\nemperors, and other rulers have erected statues of themselves to\nremind their subjects of their authority and power. Triumphal\narches, columns, and other monuments have been built to commemorate\nmilitary victories and sacrifices and other events of civic\nimportance. A monument, by definition, is a structure that is\ndesigned as a means of expression. When a government entity\narranges for the construction of a monument, it does so because it\nwishes to convey some thought or instill some feeling in those who\nsee the structure. Neither the Court of Appeals nor respondent\ndisputes the obvious proposition that a monument that is\ncommissioned and financed by a government body for placement on\npublic land constitutes government speech.Just as government-commissioned\nand government-financed monuments speak for the government, so do\nprivately financed and donated monuments that the government\naccepts and displays to the public on government land. It certainly\nis not common for property owners to open up their property for the\ninstallation of permanent monuments that convey a message with\nwhich they do not wish to be associated. And because property\nowners typically do not permit the construction of such monuments\non their land, persons who observe donated monuments routinely\u2014and\nreasonably\u2014interpret them as conveying some message on the property\nowner\u2019s behalf. In this context, there is little chance that\nobservers will fail to appreciate the identity of the speaker. This\nis true whether the monument is located on private property or on\npublic property, such as national, state, or city park\nland.We think it is fair to say that\nthroughout our Nation\u2019s history, the general government practice\nwith respect to donated monuments has been one of selective\nreceptivity. A great many of the monuments that adorn the Nation\u2019s\npublic parks were financed with private funds or donated by private\nparties. Sites managed by the National Park Service contain\nthousands of privately designed or funded commemorative objects,\nincluding the Statue of Liberty, the Marine Corps War Memorial (the\nIwo Jima monument), and the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. States and\ncities likewise have received thousands of donated monuments. See,e.g., App. to Brief for International Municipal Lawyers\nAssociation asAmicus Curiae15a\u201329a (hereinafter IMLA\nBrief) (listing examples); Brief for American Legion et al. asAmici Curiae7, and n. 2 (same). By accepting monuments\nthat are privately funded or donated, government entities save tax\ndollars and are able to acquire monuments that they could not have\nafforded to fund on their own.But while government entities\nregularly accept privately funded or donated monuments, they have\nexercised selectivity. An example discussed by the city of New York\nasamicus curiaeis illustrative. In the wake of the\ncontroversy generated in 1876 when the city turned down a donated\nmonument to honor Daniel Webster, the city adopted rules governing\nthe acceptance of artwork for permanent placement in city parks,\nrequiring, among other things, that \u201cany proposed gift of art had\nto be viewed either in its finished condition or as a model before\nacceptance.\u201d Brief for City of New York asAmicus Curiae4\u20135 (hereinafter NYC Brief). Across the country, \u201cmunicipalities\ngenerally exercise editorial control over donated monuments through\nprior submission requirements, design input, requested\nmodifications, written criteria, and legislative approvals of\nspecific content proposals.\u201d IMLA Brief 21.Public parks are often closely\nidentified in the public mind with the government unit that owns\nthe land. City parks\u2014ranging from those in small towns, like\nPioneer Park in Pleasant Grove City, to those in major\nmetropolises, like Central Park in New York City\u2014commonly play an\nimportant role in defining the identity that a city projects to its\nown residents and to the outside world. Accordingly, cities and\nother jurisdictions take some care in accepting donated monuments.\nGovernment decisionmakers select the monuments that portray what\nthey view as appropriate for the place in question, taking into\naccount such content-based factors as esthetics, history, and local\nculture. The monuments that are accepted, therefore, are meant to\nconvey and have the effect of conveying a government message, and\nthey thus constitute government speech.IVAIn this case, it is\nclear that the monuments in Pleasant Grove\u2019s Pioneer Park represent\ngovernment speech. Although many of the monuments were not designed\nor built by the City and were donated in completed form by private\nentities, the City decided to accept those donations and to display\nthem in the Park. Respondent does not claim that the City ever\nopened up the Park for the placement of whatever permanent\nmonuments might be offered by private donors. Rather, the City has\n\u201ceffectively controlled\u201d the messages sent by the monuments in the\nPark by exercising \u201cfinal approval authority\u201d over their selection.Johanns, 544 U. S., at 560\u2013561. The City has selected\nthose monuments that it wants to display for the purpose of\npresenting the image of the City that it wishes to project to all\nwho frequent the Park; it has taken ownership of most of the\nmonuments in the Park, including the Ten Commandments monument that\nis the focus of respondent\u2019s concern; and the City has now\nexpressly set forth the criteria it will use in making future\nselections.BRespondent voices the\nlegitimate concern that the government speech doctrine not be used\nas a subterfuge for favoring certain private speakers over others\nbased on viewpoint. Respondent\u2019s suggested solution is to require a\ngovernment entity accepting a privately donated monument to go\nthrough a formal process of adopting a resolution publicly\nembracing \u201cthe message\u201d that the monument conveys. See Brief for\nRespondent 33\u201334, 57.We see no reason for\nimposing a requirement of this sort. The parks of this country\ncontain thousands of donated monuments that government entities\nhave used for their own expressive purposes, usually without\nproducing the sort of formal documentation that respondent now says\nis required to escape Free Speech Clause restrictions. Requiring\nall of these jurisdictions to go back and proclaim formally that\nthey adopt all of these monuments as their own expressive vehicles\nwould be a pointless exercise that the Constitution does not\nmandate.In this case, for example,\nalthough respondent argues that Pleasant Grove City has not\nadequately \u201ccontroll[ed] the message,\u201did., at 31, of the\nTen Commandments monument, the City took ownership of that monument\nand put it on permanent display in a park that it owns and manages\nand that is linked to the City\u2019s identity. All rights previously\npossessed by the monument\u2019s donor have been relinquished. The\nCity\u2019s actions provided a more dramatic form of adoption than the\nsort of formal endorsement that respondent would demand,\nunmistakably signifying to all Park visitors that the City intends\nthe monument to speak on its behalf. And the City has made no\neffort to abridge the traditional free speech rights\u2014the right to\nspeak, distribute leaflets, etc.\u2014that may be exercised by\nrespondent and others in Pioneer Park.What respondent demands, however,\nis that the City \u201cadopt\u201d or \u201cembrace\u201d \u201cthe message\u201d that it\nassociates with the monument.Id., at 33\u201334, 57.\nRespondent seems to think that a monument can convey only one\n\u201cmessage\u201d\u2014which is, presumably, the message intended by the\ndonor\u2014and that, if a government entity that accepts a monument for\nplacement on its property does not formally embracethatmessage, then the government has not engaged in expressive\nconduct.This argument fundamentally\nmisunderstands the way monuments convey meaning. The meaning\nconveyed by a monument is generally not a simple one like\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018Beef. It\u2019s What\u2019s for Dinner.\u2019\u00a0\u201dJohanns,supra, at 554. Even when a monument features the written\nword, the monument may be intended to be interpreted, and may in\nfact be interpreted by different observers, in a variety of ways.\nMonuments called to our attention by the briefing in this case\nillustrate this phenomenon.What, for example, is \u201cthe\nmessage\u201d of the Greco-Roman mosaic of the word \u201cImagine\u201d that was\ndonated to New York City\u2019s Central Park in memory of John Lennon?\nSee NYC Brief 18; App. toid., at A5. Some observers may\n\u201cimagine\u201d the musical contributions that John Lennon would have\nmade if he had not been killed. Others may think of the lyrics of\nthe Lennon song that obviously inspired the mosaic and may\n\u201cimagine\u201d a world without religion, countries, possessions, greed,\nor hunger.[Footnote\n2]Or, to take another example, what\nis \u201cthe message\u201d of the \u201clarge bronze statue displaying the word\n\u2018peace\u2019 in many world languages\u201d that is displayed in Fayetteville,\nArkansas?[Footnote\n3]These text-based monuments are\nalmost certain to evoke different thoughts and sentiments in the\nminds of different observers, and the effect of monuments that do\nnot contain text is likely to be even more variable. Consider, for\nexample, the statue of Pancho Villa that was given to the city of\nTucson, Arizona, in 1981 by the Government of Mexico with,\naccording to a Tucson publication, \u201ca wry sense of irony.\u201d[Footnote 4] Does this statue\ncommemorate a \u201crevolutionary leader who advocated for agrarian\nreform and the poor\u201d or \u201ca violent bandit\u201d? IMLA Brief\n13.Contrary to respondent\u2019s apparent\nbelief, it frequently is not possible to identify a single\n\u201cmessage\u201d that is conveyed by an object or structure, and\nconsequently, the thoughts or sentiments expressed by a government\nentity that accepts and displays such an object may be quite\ndifferent from those of either its creator or its donor.[Footnote 5] By accepting a privately\ndonated monument and placing it on city property, a city engages in\nexpressive conduct, but the intended and perceived significance of\nthat conduct may not coincide with the thinking of the monument\u2019s\ndonor or creator. Indeed, when a privately donated memorial is\nfunded by many small donations, the donors themselves may differ in\ntheir interpretation of the monument\u2019s significance.[Footnote 6] By accepting such a monument, a\ngovernment entity does not necessarily endorse the specific meaning\nthat any particular donor sees in the monument.The message that a government\nentity conveys by allowing a monument to remain on its property may\nalso be altered by the subsequent addition of other monuments in\nthe same vicinity. For example, following controversy over the\noriginal design of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, a compromise was\nreached that called for the nearby addition of a flagstaff and\nbronze Three Soldiers statue, which many believed changed the\noverall effect of the memorial. See,e.g., J. Mayo, War\nMemorials as Political Landscape: The American Experience and\nBeyond 202\u2013203, 205 (1988); K. Hass, Carried to the Wall: American\nMemory and the Vietnam Veterans Memorial 15\u201318 (1998).The \u201cmessage\u201d conveyed by a\nmonument may change over time. A study of war memorials found that\n\u201cpeople reinterpret\u201d the meaning of these memorials as \u201chistorical\ninterpretations\u201d and \u201cthe society around them changes.\u201d Mayo,supra, at 8\u20139.A striking example of how the\ninterpretation of a monument can evolve is provided by one of the\nmost famous and beloved public monuments in the United States, the\nStatue of Liberty. The statue was given to this country by the\nThird French Republic to express republican solidarity and\nfriendship between the two countries. See J. Res. 6, 44th Cong., 2d\nSess. (1877), 19 Stat. 410 (accepting the statue as an \u201cexpressive\nand felicitous memorial of the sympathy of the citizens of our\nsister Republic\u201d). At the inaugural ceremony, President Cleveland\nsaw the statue as an emblem of international friendship and the\nwidespread influence of American ideals. See Inauguration of the\nStatue of Liberty Enlightening the World 30 (1887). Only later did\nthe statue come to be viewed as a beacon welcoming immigrants to a\nland of freedom. See Public Papers of the Presidents, Ronald\nReagan, Vol. 2, July 3, 1986, pp. 918\u2013919 (1989), Remarks at the\nOpening Ceremonies of the Statue of Liberty Centennial Celebration\nin New York, New York; J. Higham, The Transformation of the Statue\nof Liberty, in Send These To Me 74\u201380 (rev. ed. 1984).CRespondent and the\nCourt of Appeals analogize the installation of permanent monuments\nin a public park to the delivery of speeches and the holding of\nmarches and demonstrations, and they thus invoke the rule that a\npublic park is a traditional public forum for these activities. But\n\u201cpublic forum principles . . . are out of place in the context of\nthis case.\u201dUnited Statesv.American Library Assn.,\nInc.,539 U. S.\n194, 205 (2003). The forum doctrine has been applied in\nsituations in which government-owned property or a government\nprogram was capable of accommodating a large number of public\nspeakers without defeating the essential function of the land or\nthe program. For example, a park can accommodate many speakers and,\nover time, many parades and demonstrations. The Combined Federal\nCampaign permits hundreds of groups to solicit donations from\nfederal employees. SeeCornelius, 473 U. S., at 804\u2013805. A\npublic university\u2019s student activity fund can provide money for\nmany campus activities. SeeRosenberger, 515 U. S., at\n825. A public university\u2019s buildings may offer meeting space for\nhundreds of student groups. SeeWidmarv.Vincent,454 U. S. 263, 274\u2013275\n(1981). A school system\u2019s internal mail facilities can support the\ntransmission of many messages to and from teachers and school\nadministrators. SeePerry Ed. Assn., 460 U. S., at 39,\n46\u201347. See alsoArkansas Ed. Television Comm\u2019nv.Forbes,523\nU. S. 666, 680\u2013681 (1998) (noting that allowing any candidate\nto participate in a televised political debate would be burdensome\non \u201clogistical grounds\u201d and \u201cwould result in less speech, not\nmore\u201d).By contrast, public\nparks can accommodate only a limited number of permanent monuments.\nPublic parks have been used, \u201c\u00a0\u2018time out of mind, . . . for\npurposes of assembly, communicating thoughts between citizens, and\ndiscussing public questions,\u2019\u00a0\u201dPerry Ed. Assn.,supra, at 45 (quotingHague, 307 U. S., at 515),\nbut \u201cone would be hard pressed to find a \u2018long tradition\u2019 of\nallowing people to permanently occupy public space with any manner\nof monuments.\u201d 499 F.\u00a03d, at 1173 (Lucero, J., dissenting from\ndenial of rehearing en banc).Speakers, no matter how\nlong-winded, eventually come to the end of their remarks; persons\ndistributing leaflets and carrying signs at some point tire and go\nhome; monuments, however, endure. They monopolize the use of the\nland on which they stand and interfere permanently with other uses\nof public space. A public park, over the years, can provide a\nsoapbox for a very large number of orators\u2014often, for all who want\nto speak\u2014but it is hard to imagine how a public park could be\nopened up for the installation of permanent monuments by every\nperson or group wishing to engage in that form of\nexpression.Respondent contends that this\nissue \u201ccan be dealt with through content-neutral time, place and\nmanner restrictions, including the option of a ban on all\nunattended displays.\u201d Brief for Respondent 14. On this view, when\nFrance presented the Statue of Liberty to the United States in\n1884, this country had the option of either (a) declining France\u2019s\noffer or (b) accepting the gift, but providing a comparable\nlocation in the harbor of New York for other statues of a similar\nsize and nature (e.g., a Statue of Autocracy, if one had\nbeen offered by, say, the German Empire or Imperial\nRussia).While respondent and some of itsamicideride the fears expressed about the consequences of\nthe Court of Appeals holding in this case, those concerns are well\nfounded. If government entities must maintain viewpoint neutrality\nin their selection of donated monuments, they must either \u201cbrace\nthemselves for an influx of clutter\u201d or face the pressure to remove\nlongstanding and cherished monuments. See 499 F.\u00a03d, at 1175\n(McConnell, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc). Every\njurisdiction that has accepted a donated war memorial may be asked\nto provide equal treatment for a donated monument questioning the\ncause for which the veterans fought. New York City, having accepted\na donated statue of one heroic dog (Balto, the sled dog who brought\nmedicine to Nome, Alaska, during a diphtheria epidemic)[Footnote 7] may be pressed to accept\nmonuments for other dogs who are claimed to be equally worthy of\ncommemoration. The obvious truth of the matter is that if public\nparks were considered to be traditional public forums for the\npurpose of erecting privately donated monuments, most parks would\nhave little choice but to refuse all such donations. And where the\napplication of forum analysis would lead almost inexorably to\nclosing of the forum, it is obvious that forum analysis is out of\nplace.Respondent compares the present\ncase toCapitol Square Review and Advisory Bd.v.Pinette,515 U. S. 753(1995),\nbut that case involved a very different situation\u2014a request by a\nprivate group, the Ku Klux Klan, to erect a cross for a period of\n16 days on public property that had been opened up for similar\ntemporary displays, including a Christmas tree and a menorah. Seeid., at 758. Although some public parks can accommodate\nand may be made generally available for temporary private displays,\nthe same is rarely true for permanent monuments.To be sure, there are limited\ncircumstances in which the forum doctrine might properly be applied\nto a permanent monument\u2014for example, if a town created a monument\non which all of its residents (or all those meeting some other\ncriterion) could place the name of a person to be honored or some\nother private message. But as a general matter, forum analysis\nsimply does not apply to the installation of permanent monuments on\npublic property.VIn sum, we hold that\nthe City\u2019s decision to accept certain privately donated monuments\nwhile rejecting respondent\u2019s is best viewed as a form of government\nspeech. As a result, the City\u2019s decision is not subject to the Free\nSpeech Clause, and the Court of Appeals erred in holding otherwise.\nWe therefore reverse.It is so ordered.Footnote 1Respondent\u2019s brief describes the\nchurch and the Seven Aphorisms as follows:\u201cThe Summum church incorporates\nelements of Gnostic Christianity, teaching that spiritual knowledge\nis experiential and that through devotion comes revelation, which\n\u2018modifies human perceptions, and transfigures the individual.\u2019SeeThe Teachings of Summum are the Teachings of Gnostic\nChristianity, http://www.summum.us/philosophy/ gnosticism.shtml\n(visited Aug. 15, 2008).\u201cCentral to Summum religious\nbelief and practice are the Seven Principles of Creation (the\n\u201cSeven Aphorisms\u201d). According to Summum doctrine, the Seven\nAphorisms were inscribed on the original tablets handed down by God\nto Moses on Mount Sinai\u2026\u00a0.\u00a0Because Moses believed that\nthe Israelites were not ready to receive the Aphorisms, he shared\nthem only with a select group of people. In the Summum Exodus\naccount, Moses then destroyed the original tablets, traveled back\nto Mount Sinai, and returned with a second set of tablets con-\ntaining the Ten Commandments.SeeThe Aphorisms of Summum\nand the Ten Commandments, http://www.summum.us/philosophy/\ntencommandments.shtml (visited Aug. 15, 2008).\u201d Brief for\nRespondent 1\u20132.Footnote 2The lyrics are as follows:\u201cImagine there\u2019s no heavenIt\u2019s easy if you tryNo hell below usAbove us only skyImagine all the peopleLiving for today...\u201cImagine there\u2019s no countriesIt isn\u2019t hard to doNothing to kill or die forAnd no religion tooImagine all the peopleLiving life in peace...\u201cYou may say I\u2019m a dreamerBut I\u2019m not the only oneI hope someday you\u2019ll join usAnd the world will be as one\u201cImagine no possessionsI wonder if you canNo need for greed or hungerA brotherhood of manImagine all the peopleSharing all the world...\u201cYou may say I\u2019m a dreamerBut I\u2019m not the only oneI hope someday you\u2019ll join usAnd the world will live as one.\u201d J.

For example, a painting of a\nreligious scene may have been commissioned and painted to express\nreligious thoughts and feelings. Even if the painting is donated to\nthe museum by a patron who shares those thoughts and feelings, it\ndoes not follow that the museum, by displaying the painting,\nintends to convey or is perceived as conveying the same\n\u201cmessage.\u201dFootnote 6For example, the Vietnam Veterans\nMemorial Fund is a private organization that obtained funding from\nover 650,000 donors for the construction of the memorial itself.\nThese donors expressed a wide range of personal sentiments in\ncontributing money for the memorial. See,e.g., J. Scruggs\n& J. Swerdlow, To Heal a Nation: The Vietnam Veterans Memorial\n23\u201328, 159 (1985).Footnote 7See NYC Brief 2; App. to Brief\nfor American Catholic Lawyers Association asAmicus Curiae1a\u201310.",
