We hold that the Federal Aviation Administration\nAuthorization Act of 1994 (FAAAA) expressly preempts two of the\ncontract\u2019s provisions, which require such a company to develop an\noff-street parking plan and display designated placards on its\nvehicles. We decline to decide in the case\u2019s present,\npre-enforcement posture whether, underCastlev.Hayes\nFreight Lines, Inc.,348 U.S.\n61(1954), federal law governing licenses for interstate motor\ncarriers prevents the Port from using the agreement\u2019s penalty\nclause to punish violations of other, non-preempted provisions.IAThe Port of Los Angeles, a division of the\nCity of Los Angeles, is the largest port in the country. The Port\nowns marine terminal facilities, which it leases to \u201cterminal\noperators\u201d (such as shipping lines and stevedoring companies) that\nload cargo onto and unload it from docking ships. Short-haul\ntrucks, called \u201cdrayage trucks,\u201d move the cargo into and out of the\nPort. The trucking companies providing those drayage services are\nall federally licensed motor carriers. Before the events giving\nrise to this case, they contracted with terminal operators to\ntransport cargo, but did not enter into agreements with the Port\nitself.The City\u2019s Board of Harbor Commissioners runs\nthe Port pursuant to a municipal ordinance known as a tariff, which\nsets out various regulations and charges. In the late 1990\u2019s, the\nBoard decided to enlarge the Port\u2019s facilities to accommodate more\nships. Neighborhood and environmental groups objected to the\nproposed expansion, arguing that it would increase congestion and\nair pollution and decrease safety in the surrounding area. A\nlawsuit they brought, and another they threatened, stymied the\nBoard\u2019s development project for almost 10 years.To address the community\u2019s concerns, the Board\nimplemented a Clean Truck Program beginning in 2007. Among other\nactions, the Board devised a standard-form \u201cconcession agreement\u201d\nto govern the relationship between the Port and any trucking\ncompany seeking to operate on the premises. Under that contract, a\ncompany may transport cargo at the Port in exchange for complying\nwith various requirements. The two directly at issue here compel\nthe company to (1) affix a placard on each truck with a phone\nnumber for reporting environmental or safety concerns (You\u2019ve seen\nthe type: \u201cHow am I driving? 213\u2013867\u20135309\u201d) and (2) submit a plan\nlisting off-street parking locations for each truck when not in\nservice. Three other provisions in the agreement, formerly dis-\nputed in this litigation, relate to the company\u2019s financial\ncapacity, its maintenance of trucks, and its employment of\ndrivers.The Board then amended the Port\u2019s tariff to\nensure that every company providing drayage services at the\nfacility would enter into the concession agreement. The mechanism\nthe Board employed is a criminal prohibition on terminal operators.\nThe amended tariff provides that \u201cno Terminal Operator shall permit\naccess into any Terminal in the Port of Los Angeles to any Drayage\nTruck unless such Drayage Truck is registered under a Concession\n[Agreement].\u201d App. 105. A violation of that provision\u2014which occurs\n\u201ceach and every day\u201d a terminal operator provides access to an\nunregistered truck\u2014is a misdemeanor.Id.,at 86. It is\npunishable by a fine of up to $500 or a prison sentence of up to\nsix months.Id.,at 85\u201386.The concession agreement itself spells out\npenalties for any signatory trucking company that violates its\nrequirements. When a company commits a \u201cMinor Default,\u201d the Port\nmay issue a warning letter or order the company to undertake\n\u201ccorrective action,\u201d complete a \u201ccourse of .\u00a0.\u00a0.\ntraining,\u201d or pay the costs of the Port\u2019s investigation.Id.,at 81\u201382. When a company commits a \u201cMajor Default,\u201d the\nPort may also suspend or revoke the company\u2019s right to provide\ndrayage services at the Port.Id.,at 82. The agreement,\nhowever, does not specify which breaches of the contract qualify as\n\u201cMajor,\u201d rather than \u201cMinor.\u201d And the parties agree that the Port\nhas never suspended or revoked a trucking company\u2019s license to\noperate at the Port for a prior violation of one of the contract\nprovisions involved in this case. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 42\u201343,\n49\u201351.BPetitioner American Trucking Associations,\nInc. (ATA), is a national trade association representing the\ntrucking industry, including drayage companies that operate at the\nPort. ATA filed suit against the Port and City, seeking an\ninjunction against the five provisions of the concession agreement\ndiscussed above. The complaint principally contended that\n\u00a714501(c)(1) of the FAAAA expressly preempts those requirements.\nThat statutory section states:\u201c[A] State [or local government] may not\nenact or enforce a law, regulation, or other provision having the\nforce and effect of law related to a price, route, or service of\nany motor carrier .\u00a0.\u00a0. with respect to the\ntransportation of property.\u201d 49 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a714501(c)(1).[1]ATA also offered a back-up argument: Even if the\nrequirements are valid, ATA claimed, the Port may not enforce them\nby withdrawing a defaulting company\u2019s right to operate at the Port.\nThat argument rested onCastlev.Hayes Freight Lines,\nInc.,348 U.S.\n61(1954), which held that Illinois could not bar a federally\nlicensed motor car- rier from its highways for prior violations of\nstate safety regulations. We reasoned inCastlethat the\nState\u2019s action conflicted with federal law providing for\ncertification of motor carriers; and ATA argued here that a similar\nconflict would inhere in applying the concession agreement to\nsuspend or revoke a trucking company\u2019s privileges. Following a\nbench trial, the District Court held that neither \u00a714501(c)(1) norCastleprevents the Port from proceeding with any part of\nits Clean Truck Program.The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit\nmainly affirmed. Most important for our purposes, the court held\nthat \u00a714501(c)(1) does not preempt the agreement\u2019s placard and\nparking requirements because they do not \u201c\u00a0\u2018\u00a0ha[ve] the\nforce and effect of law.\u2019\u00a0\u201d 660 F.3d 384, 395 (2011) (quoting\n\u00a714501(c)(1)). The court reasoned that those requirements, rather\nthan regulating the drayage market, advance the Port\u2019s own\n\u201cbusiness interest\u201d in \u201cmanaging its facilities.\u201dId.,at\n401. Both provisions were \u201cdesigned to address [a] specific\nproprietary problem[\u00a0]\u201d\u2014the need to \u201cincrease the community\ngood-will necessary to facilitate Port expansion.\u201dId.,at\n406\u2013407; seeid., at 409. The Ninth Circuit also held the\nagreement\u2019s financial-capacity and truck-maintenance provisions not\npreempted, for reasons not relevant here.[2] Section 14501(c)(1), the court decided, preempts\nonly the contract\u2019s employment provision. Finally, the Ninth\nCircuit rejected ATA\u2019s claim thatCastlebars the Port from\napplying the agreement\u2019s penalty clause to withdraw a trucking\ncompany\u2019s right to operate at the facility. The court thoughtCastleinapplicable because of the narrower exclusion in\nthis case: \u201cUnlike a ban on usingallof a State\u2019s\nfreeways,\u201d the court reasoned, \u201ca limitation on access to a single\nPort does not prohibit motor carriers\u201d from generally participating\nin interstate commerce. 660 F.\u00a03d, at 403.We granted certiorari to resolve two questions:\nfirst, whether \u00a714501(c)(1) of the FAAAA preempts the concession\nagreement\u2019s placard and parking provisions; and second, whetherCastleprecludes reliance on the agreement\u2019s penalty clause\nto suspend or revoke a trucking company\u2019s privileges. See 568\nU.\u00a0S. ___ (2013). Contrary to the Ninth Circuit, we hold that\nthe placard and parking requirements are preempted as \u201cprovision[s]\nhaving the force and effect of law.\u201d That determination does not\nobviate the enforcement issue arising fromCastlebecause\nthe Ninth Circuit\u2019s rulings upholding the agreement\u2019s\nfinancial-capacity and truck-maintenance provisions have now become\nfinal;[3] accordingly, the Port\ncould try to apply its penalty provision to trucking companies that\nhave violated those surviving requirements. But we nonetheless\ndecline to address theCastlequestion because the case\u2019s\npre-enforcement posture obscures the nature of the agreement\u2019s\nremedial scheme, rendering any decision at this point a shot in the\ndark.IISection 14501(c)(1), once again, preempts a\nstate \u201claw, regulation, or other provision having the force and\neffect of law related to a price, route, or service of any motor\ncar- rier .\u00a0.\u00a0. with respect to the transportation of\nproperty.\u201d All parties agree that the Port\u2019s placard and parking\nrequirements relate to a motor carrier\u2019s price, route, or service\nwith respect to transporting property. The only disputed question\nis whether those requirements \u201chav[e] the force and effect of law.\u201d\nThe Port claims that they do not, because the \u201cconcession contract\nis just [like] a private agreement,\u201d made to advance the Port\u2019s\ncommercial and \u201cproprietary interests.\u201d Brief for Respondent City\nof Los Angeles et\u00a0al. 19 (Brief for City of Los Angeles)\n(internal quotation marks omitted).[4]We can agree with the Port on this premise:\nSection 14501(c)(1) draws a rough line between a government\u2019s\nexercise of regulatory authority and its own contract-based\nparticipation in a market. We recognized that distinction inAmerican Airlines, Inc.v.Wolens,513 U.S.\n219(1995), when we construed another statute\u2019s near-identical\n\u201cforce and effect of law\u201d language. That phrase, we stated,\n\u201cconnotes official, government-imposed policies\u201d prescribing\n\u201cbinding standards of conduct.\u201dId.,at 229, n.\u00a05\n(internal quotation marks omitted). And we contrasted that\nquintessential regulatory action to \u201ccontractual commitment[s]\nvoluntarily undertaken.\u201dId.,at 229 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). InWolens, we addressed a State\u2019s\nenforcement of an agreement between two private parties. But the\nsame reasoning holds if the government enters into a contract just\nas a private party would\u2014for example, if a State (or City or Port)\nsigns an agreement with a trucking company to transport goods at a\nspecified price. See,e.g., Building & Constr. Trades\nCouncilv.Associated Builders & Contractors of Mass./R.\nI., Inc.,507 U.S.\n218, 233 (1993) (When a State acts as a purchaser of services,\n\u201cit does not \u2018regulate\u2019 the workings of the market .\u00a0.\u00a0.\n; it exemplifies them\u201d (some internal quotation marks omitted)).\nThe \u201cforce and effect of law\u201d language in \u00a714501(c)(1) excludes\nsuch everyday contractual arrangements from the clause\u2019s scope.\nThat phrasing targets the State acting as a State, not as any\nmarket actor\u2014or other- wise said, the State acting in a regulatory\nrather than proprietary mode.But that statutory reading gets the Port\nnothing, because it exercised classic regulatory authority\u2014complete\nwith the use of criminal penalties\u2014in imposing the placard and\nparking requirements at issue here. Consider again how those\nrequirements work. They are, to be sure, contained in contracts\nbetween the Port and trucking companies. But those contracts do not\nstand alone, as the result merely of the parties\u2019 voluntary\ncommitments. The Board of Harbor Commissioners aimed to \u201crequire\nparties who access Port land and terminals for purposes of pro-\nviding drayage services\u201d to enter into concession agreements with\nthe Port. App. 108 (Board\u2019s \u201cFindings\u201d). And it accomplished that\nobjective by amending the Port\u2019s tariff\u2014a form of municipal\nordinance\u2014to provide that \u201cno Terminal Operator shall permit\u201d a\ndrayage truck to gain \u201caccess into any Terminal in the Port\u201d unless\nthe truck is \u201cregistered under\u201d such a concession agreement.Id., at 105. A violation of that tariff provision is a\nviolation of criminal law. And it is punishable by a fine or a\nprison sentence of up to six months.Id.,at 85\u201386. So the\ncontract here functions as part and parcel of a governmental\nprogram wielding coercive power over private parties, backed by the\nthreat of criminal punishment.That counts as action \u201chaving the force and\neffect of law\u201d if anything does. The Port here has not acted as a\nprivate party, contracting in a way that the owner of an ordinary\ncommercial enterprise could mimic. Rather, it has forced terminal\noperators\u2014and through them, trucking companies\u2014to alter their\nconduct by implementing a criminal prohibition punishable by time\nin prison. In some cases, the question whether governmental action\nhas the force of law may pose difficulties; the line between\nregulatory and proprietary conduct has soft edges. But this case\ntakes us nowhere near those uncertain boundaries. Contractual\ncommitments resulting not from ordinary bargaining (as inWolens), but instead from the threat of criminal sanctions\nmanifest the governmentquagovernment, performing its\nprototypical regulatory role.The Port\u2019s primary argument to the contrary,\nlike the Ninth Circuit\u2019s, focuses on motive rather than means. The\nCourt of Appeals related how community opposition had frustrated\nthe Port\u2019s expansion, and concluded that the Clean Truck Program\n\u201crespon[ded] to perceived business necessity.\u201d 660 F.\u00a03d, at\n407. The Port tells the identical story, emphasizing that private\ncompanies have similar business incentives to \u201cadopt[\u00a0] \u2018green\ngrowth\u2019 plans like the Port\u2019s.\u201d Brief for City of Los Angeles 30.\nWe have no reason to doubt that account of events; we can assume\nthe Port acted to enhance goodwill and improve the odds of\nachieving its business plan\u2014just as a private company might. But\nthe Port\u2019s intentions are not what matters. That is because, as we\njust described, the Port chose a tool to fulfill those goals which\nonly a government can wield: the hammer of the criminal law. SeeUnited Haulers Assn., Inc.v.Oneida-Herkimer Solid Waste\nMgmt. Auth.,438 F.3d 150, 157 (CA2 2006), aff\u2019d,550\nU.S. 330(2007). And when the government employs such a\ncoercive mechanism, available to no private party, it acts with the\nforce and effect of law, whether or not it does so to turn a\nprofit. Only if it forgoes the (distinctively governmental)\nexercise of legal authority may it escape \u00a714501(c)(1)\u2019s preemptive\nscope.The Port also tries another tack, reminding us\nthat the criminal sanctions here fall on terminal operators alone,\nnot on the trucking companies subject to the agreement\u2019s\nrequirements; hence, the Port maintains, the matter of \u201ccriminal\npenalties is a red herring.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 31; see Brief for\nCity of Los Angeles 39\u201340. But we fail to see why the target of the\nsanctions makes any difference. The Port selected an indirect but\nwholly effective means of \u201crequir[ing] parties .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nproviding drayage services\u201d to display placards and submit parking\nplans: To wit, the Port required terminal operators, on pain of\ncriminal penalties, to insist that the truckers make those\ncommitments. App. 108; seesupra,at 3, 8. We have often\nrejected efforts by States to avoid preemption by shifting their\nregulatory focus from one company to another in the same supply\nchain. See,e.g.,Rowev.New Hampshire Motor\nTransp. Assn.,552 U.S.\n364, 371\u2013373 (2008) (finding preemption under the FAAAA\nalthough the State\u2019s requirements directly targeted retailers\nrather than motor carriers);Engine Mfrs. Assn.v.South\nCoast Air Quality Management Dist.,541\nU.S. 246, 255 (2004) (finding preemption under the Clean Air\nAct although the requirements directly targeted car buyers rather\nthan sellers). The same goes here. The Port made its regulation of\ndrayage trucks mandatory by imposing criminal penalties on the\nentities hiring all such trucks at the facility. Slice it or dice\nit any which way, the Port thus acted with the \u201cforce of law.\u201dIIIOur rejection of the concession agreement\u2019s\nplacard and parking requirements does not conclude this case. Two\nother provisions of the agreement are now in effect: As noted\nearlier, the Ninth Circuit upheld the financial-capacity and\ntruck-maintenance requirements, and that part of its decision has\nbecome final. Seesupra,at 5, and n.\u00a02. ATA argues\nthat our holding inCastlelimits the way the Port can\nenforce those remaining requirements. According to ATA, the Port\nmay not rely on the agreement\u2019s penalty provision to suspend or\nrevoke the right of non-complying trucking companies to operate on\nthe premises. As we have described,Castlerebuffed a\nState\u2019s attempt to bar a federally licensed motor carrier from its\nhighways for past infringements of state safety regulations. A\nfederal statute, we explained, gave a federal agency the authority\nto license interstate motor carriers, as well as a carefully\ncircumscribed power to suspend or terminate those licenses for\nviolations of law. That statute, we held, implicitly prohibited a\nState from \u201ctak[ing] action\u201d\u2014like a ban on the use of its\nhighways\u2014\u201camounting to a suspension or revocation of an interstate\ncarrier\u2019s [federally] granted right to operate.\u201d 348 U.\u00a0S., at\n63\u201364.The parties here dispute whetherCastlerestricts the Port\u2019s remedial authority. The Port echoes the Ninth\nCircuit\u2019s view that banning a truck from \u201callof a State\u2019s\nfreeways\u201d is meaningfully different from denying it \u201caccess to a\nsingle Port.\u201d 660 F.\u00a03d, at 403; see Brief for City of Los\nAngeles 49. ATA responds that because the Port is a \u201ccrucial\nchannel of interstate commerce,\u201dCastleapplies to it just\nas much as to roads. Brief for Petitioner 18.But we see another question here: Does the\nPort\u2019s enforcement scheme involve curtailing drayage trucks\u2019\noperations in the wayCastleprohibits, even assuming that\ndecision applies to facilities like this one? As just indicated,Castleputs limits on how a State or locality can punish an\ninterstate motor carrier for prior violations of truck- ing\nregulations (like the concession agreement\u2019s requirements). Nothing\nwe said there, however, prevents a State from taking off the road a\nvehicle that is contemporaneously out of compliance with such\nregulations. Indeed, ATA filed anamicusbrief inCastleexplaining that a vehicle \u201cthat fails to comply with\nthe state\u2019s regulations may be barred from the state\u2019s highways.\u201d\nBrief for ATA, O.\u00a0T 1954, No. 44, p.\u00a012; see Brief for\nRespondent,id., p.\u00a023 (A State may \u201cstop and prevent\nfrom continuing on the highway any motor vehicle which it finds not\nto be in compliance\u201d). And ATA reiterates that view here, as does\nthe United States asamicus curiae. See Reply Brief 22;\nBrief for United States 29\u201330. So the Port would not violateCastleif it barred a truck from operating at its facilities\nto prevent an ongoing violation of the agreement\u2019s\nrequirements.And at this juncture, we have no basis for\nfinding that the Port will ever use the agreement\u2019s penalty\nprovision for anything more than that. That provision, to be sure,\nmight be read to give the Port broader authority: As noted earlier,\nthe relevant text enables the Port to suspend or revoke a trucking\ncompany\u2019s right to provide dray- age services at the facility as a\n\u201c[r]emedy\u201d for a \u201cMajor Default.\u201d App. 82; seesupra,at 3.\nBut the agreement nowhere states what counts as a \u201cMajor\nDefault\u201d\u2014and specifically, whether a company\u2019s breach of the\nfinancial-capacity or truck-maintenance requirements would\nqual-ify. And the Port has in fact never used its suspension or\nrevocation power to penalize a past violation of those\nrequirements. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 43, 50\u201351. Indeed, the Port\u2019s\nbrief states that \u201cit does not claim[\u00a0] the authority to\npunish past, cured violations of the requirements challenged here\nthrough suspension or revocation.\u201d Brief for City of Los Angeles 62\n(internal quotation marks omitted). So the kind of enforcement ATA\nfears, and believes inconsistent withCastle, might never\ncome to pass at all.In these circumstances, we decide not to decide\nATA\u2019sCastle-based challenge. That claim, by its nature,\nattacks the Port\u2019s enforcement scheme. But given the\npre-enforcement posture of this case, we cannot tell what that\nscheme entails. It might look like the one forbidden inCastle(as ATA anticipates), or else it might not (as the\nPort assures us). We see no reason to take a guess now about what\nthe Port will do later. There will be time enough to address theCastlequestion when, if ever, the Port enforces its\nagreement in a way arguably violating that decision.IVSection 14501(c)(1) of the FAAAA preempts the\nplacard and parking provisions of the Port\u2019s concession agreement.\nWe decline to decide on the present record ATA\u2019s separate\nchallenge, based onCastle, to that agreement\u2019s penalty\nprovision. Accordingly, the judgment of the Ninth Circuit is\nreversed in part, and the case is remanded for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.Notes1ATA also contended that a\nseparate provision, 49 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a714506(a), preempts the\nagreement\u2019s placard requirement. That section bars state and local\ngovernments from enacting or enforcing \u201cany law, rule,\nregulation[,] standard, or other provision having the force and\neffect of law\u201d that obligates a motor carrier to display any form\nof identification other than those the Secretary of Transportation\nhas required.Ibid.The just-quoted language is the only\npart of \u00a714506(a) disputed here, and it is materially identical to\nlanguage in \u00a714501(c)(1). We focus on \u00a714501(c)(1) for ease of\nreference, but everything we say about that provision also applies\nto \u00a714506(a).2For those curious, the\ncourt held that the financial-capacity requirement is not\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018related to a [motor carrier\u2019s] price, route, or\nservice,\u2019\u00a0\u201d and that the truck-maintenance requirement falls\nwithin a statutory exception for safety regulation. 660 F.\u00a03d,\nat 395, 403\u2013406 (quoting \u00a714501(c)(1)); see \u00a714501(c)(2)(A) (safety\nexception).3ATA\u2019s petition for\ncertiorari did not seek review of the Ninth Circuit\u2019s determination\nthat the truck-maintenance provision is valid. The petition did ask\nus to consider the court\u2019s ruling on the financial-capacity\nprovision, but we declined to do so.4The Port\u2019s brief\noccasionally frames the issue differently\u2014as whether a freestanding\n\u201cmarket-participant exception\u201d limits \u00a714501(c)(1)\u2019s express terms.\nSee Brief for City of Los Angeles 24. But at oral argument, the\nPort emphasized that the supposed exception it invoked in fact\nderives from \u00a714501(c)(1)\u2019s \u201cforce and effect of law\u201d language. See\nTr. of Oral Arg. 31 (\u201c[W]hat we are calling the market participant\nexception .\u00a0.\u00a0. is generally congruent with[\u00a0] what\nis meant by Congress by the term \u2018force and effect of law\u2019\u00a0\u201d);id., at 39\u201340 (\u201cI\u2019m .\u00a0.\u00a0. relying on the language\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. force and effect of law,\u201d which \u201cinvites a market\nparticipant analysis\u201d). We therefore have no occasion to consider\nwhether or when a preemption clause lacking such language would\nexcept a state or local government\u2019s proprietary\nactions.",
