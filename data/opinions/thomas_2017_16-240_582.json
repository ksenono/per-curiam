First, this case comes to us on\nthe parties\u2019 \u201cassumption[s]\u201d that the closure of the courtroom\nduring jury selection \u201cwas a Sixth Amendment violation\u201d and that\n\u201cdefense counsel provided ineffective assistance\u201d by \u201cfailing to\nobject\u201d to it.Ante,at 1, 15. The Court previously held in\naper curiamopinion\u2014issued without the benefit of merits\nbriefing or argument\u2014that the Sixth Amendment right to a public\ntrial extends to jury selection. SeePresleyv.Georgia, 558 U.\u00a0S. 209, 213 (2010) ;id., at 216\n(Thomas, J., dissenting). I have some doubts about whether that\nholding is consistent with the original understanding of the right\nto a public trial, and I would be open to reconsidering it in a\ncase in which we are asked to do so.Second, the Court \u201cassume[s],\u201d for the\n\u201canalytical purposes of this case,\u201d that a defendant may establish\nprejudice underStricklandv.Washington, 466\nU.\u00a0S. 668 (1984) , by demonstrating that his attorney\u2019s error\nled to a fundamentally unfair trial.Ante,at 11. According\ntoStrickland, a defendant may establish prejudice by\nshowing \u201ca reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s\nunprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been\ndifferent\u201d; by showing an \u201c[a]ctual or constructive denial of the\nassistance of counsel altogether\u201d; or by showing that counsel\nlabored under \u201can actual conflict of interest.\u201d 466 U.\u00a0S., at\n692\u2013694.Stricklanddid not hold, as the Court assumes, that\na defendant may establish prejudice by showing that his counsel\u2019s\nerrors \u201crendered the trial fundamentally unfair.\u201dAnte,at\n11. Because the Court concludes that the closure during\npetitioner\u2019s jury selection did not lead to fundamental unfairness\nin any event,ante,at 15\u201316, no part of the discussion\nabout fundamental unfairness, seeante,at 11\u201315, is\nnecessary to its result.In light of these observations, I do not read\nthe opinion of the Court to preclude the approach set forth in\nJustice Alito\u2019s opinion, which correctly applies our\nprecedents.",
