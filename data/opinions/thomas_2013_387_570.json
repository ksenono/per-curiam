ANTHONY JAMES\nKEBODEAUXon writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the fifth circuit[June 24, 2013]Justice Thomas, with\nwhom Justice Scalia joins as to Parts I, II, and III\u2013B,\ndissenting.Anthony Kebodeaux was\nconvicted under the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act\n(SORNA), 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a716901 et\u00a0seq., for failing to\nupdate his sex of- fender registration when he moved from one Texas\ncity to another. The Court today holds that Congress has power\nunder the Necessary and Proper Clause to enact SORNA and\ncriminalize Kebodeaux\u2019s failure to update his registration. I\ndisagree. As applied to Kebodeaux, SORNA does not \u201ccarr[y] into\nExecution\u201d any of the federal powers enu- merated in the\nConstitution. Art.\u00a0I, \u00a78, cl. 18. Rather, it usurps the\ngeneral police power vested in the States. Because SORNA\u2019s\nregistration requirements are unconstitutional as applied to\nKebodeaux, I respectfully dissent.ICongress enacted\nSORNA in 2006. SORNA requires that every \u201csex offender shall\nregister, and keep the registration current, in each jurisdiction\nwhere the offender resides, where the offender is an employee, and\nwhere the offender is a student.\u201d 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a716913(a).\n[1] These requirements \u201capply\nto all sex offenders, including sex offenders convicted of the\noffense for which registration is required prior to the enactment\nof [SORNA].\u201d 28 CFR \u00a772.3 (2012). As relevant here, SORNA makes it\na federal crime when someone who is required to register as a sex\noffender \u201cknowingly fails to register or update a regis- tration\u201d\nand that person \u201cis a sex offender [as defined by SORNA] by reason\nof a conviction under Federal law (including the Uniform Code of\nMilitary Justice).\u201d 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a72250(a)(2)(A), (3).In March 1999, Anthony\nKebodeaux had consensual sex with a 15-year-old girl when he was a\n20-year-old Air- man in the U.\u00a0S. Air Force. He was convicted\nby a court-martial of carnal knowledge of a female under the age of\n16, in violation of Article 120(b) of the Uniform Code of Military\nJustice (UCMJ). He was sentenced to three months\u2019 imprisonment and\nreceived a bad-conduct discharge. He completed his sentence in\nSeptember 1999 and was no longer in federal custody or the military\nwhen Congress enacted SORNA, which required him to register as a\nsex offender. In 2007, Kebodeaux failed to update his sex-offender\nregistration within three days of moving from El Paso, Texas, to\nSan Antonio, Texas. He was convicted under \u00a72250(a)(2)(A) in 2008\nand sentenced to a year and a day in prison. The question before\nthe Court is whether Congress has power to require Kebodeaux to\nregister as a sex offender and to criminalize his failure to do\nso.IIAThe Constitution\ncreates a Federal Government with limited powers. Congress has no\npowers except those specified in the Constitution. See Marbury v.\nMadison, 1 Cranch 137, 176 (1803) (Marshall, C.\u00a0J.) (\u201cThe\npowers of the legislature are defined, and limited; and that those\nlimits may not be mistaken, or forgotten, the constitution is\nwritten\u201d). Thus, \u201c[e]very law enacted by Congress must be based on\none or more of its powers enumerated in the Constitution.\u201d United\nStates v. Morrison, 529 U.\u00a0S. 598, 607 (2000) .A different default\nrule applies to the States. As the Tenth Amendment makes clear, the\nStates enjoy all powers that the Constitution does not withhold\nfrom them. (\u201cThe powers not delegated to the United States by the\nConstitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to\nthe States respectively, or to the people\u201d) While the powers of\nCongress are \u201cfew and defined,\u201d the powers that \u201cremain in the\nState governments are numerous and indefinite.\u201d The Federalist No.\n45, p. 328 (B. Wright ed. 1961) (J. Madison).The Constitution sets\nforth Congress\u2019 limited powers in Article I. That Article begins by\n\u201cvest[ing]\u201d in Congress \u201c[a]ll legislative Powers herein granted,\u201d\nand then enumerates those powers in \u00a78. The final clause of \u00a78, the\nNecessary and Proper Clause, gives Congress power \u201c[t]o make all\nLaws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into\nExecution the foregoing Powers and all other Powers vested by this\nConstitution in the Government of the United States, or in any\nDepartment or Officer thereof.\u201d Art.\u00a0I, \u00a78, cl. 18.\nImportantly, the Necessary and Proper Clause is not a freestanding\ngrant of congressional power, but rather an authorization to makes\nlaws that are necessary to execute both the powers vested in\nCongress by the preceding clauses of \u00a78, and the powers vested in\nCongress and the other branches by other provisions of the\nConstitution. See, e.g., Kinsella v. United States ex rel.\nSingleton, 361 U.\u00a0S. 234, 247 (1960) (\u201cThe [Necessary and\nProper Clause] is not itself a grant of power, but a caveat that\nthe Congress possesses all the means necessary to carry out the\nspecifically granted \u2018foregoing\u2019 powers of \u00a78 \u2018and all other Powers\nvested by this Constitution\u2019\u00a0\u201d).In McCulloch v.\nMaryland, 4 Wheat. 316 (1819), Chief Justice Marshall famously set\nforth the Court\u2019s interpretation of the Necessary and Proper\nClause:\u201cLet the end be legitimate, let it be\nwithin the scope of the constitution, and all means which are\nappropriate, which are plainly adapted to that end, which are not\nprohibited, but consist[ent] with the letter and spirit of the\nconstitution, are constitutional.\u201d Id., at 421.Under this formulation, a federal law is a valid\nexercise of Congress\u2019 power under the Clause if it satisfies a\ntwo-part test. \u201cFirst, the law must be directed toward a\n\u2018legitimate\u2019 end, which McCulloch defines as one \u2018within the scope\nof the [C]onstitution.\u2019\u00a0\u201d United States v. Comstock, 560\nU.\u00a0S. 126, 160 (2010) (Thomas, J., dissenting) (quoting 4\nWheat., at 421). In other words, the law must be directed at\n\u201ccarrying into Execution\u201d one or more of the powers delegated to\nthe Federal Government by the Constitution. Art.\u00a0I, \u00a78, cl.\n18. \u201cSecond, there must be a necessary and proper fit between the\n\u2018means\u2019 (the federal law) and the \u2018end\u2019 (the enumerated power or\npowers) it is designed to serve.\u201d Comstock, 560 U.\u00a0S., at 160\n(Thomas, J., dissenting). \u201cThe means Congress selects will be\ndeemed \u2018necessary\u2019 if they are \u2018appropriate\u2019 and \u2018plainly adapted\u2019\nto the exercise of an enumerated power, and \u2018proper\u2019 if they are\nnot otherwise \u2018prohibited\u2019 by the Constitution and not\n\u2018[in]consistent\u2019 with its \u2018letter and spirit.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Id., at\n160\u2013161 (quoting Art.\u00a0I, \u00a78, cl. 18 and McCulloch, 4 Wheat.,\nat 421).Both parts of this test\nare critical. \u201c[N]o matter how \u2018necessary\u2019 or \u2018proper\u2019 an Act of\nCongress may be to its objective, Congress lacks authority to\nlegislate if the objective is anything other than \u2018carrying into\nExecution\u2019 one or more of the Federal Government\u2019s enumerated\npowers.\u201d Comstock, supra, at 161 (Thomas, J., dissenting). As\napplied to Kebodeaux, SORNA fails this test.BIt is undisputed that\nno enumerated power in Article I, \u00a78, gives Congress the power to\npunish sex offenders who fail to register, nor does any other\nprovision in the Constitution vest Congress or the other branches\nof the Federal Government with such a power. Thus, SORNA is a valid\nexercise of congressional authority only if it is \u201cnecessary and\nproper for carrying into Execution\u201d one or more of those federal\npowers enumerated in the Constitution.In the course of this\nlitigation, the Government has argued that Kebodeaux\u2019s conviction\nunder \u00a72250(a)(2)(A) executes Congress\u2019 enumerated powers to spend\nfor the gen- eral welfare, Art.\u00a0I, \u00a78, cl.\u00a01; to regulate\ninterstate commerce, \u00a78, cl.\u00a03; and to regulate the armed\nforces, \u00a78, cl. 14. But none of these powers justifies applying\n\u00a72250(a)(2)(A) to Kebodeaux. The Spending Clause ar- gument is a\nnonstarter. Section 2250(a)(2)(A) does not execute Congress\u2019\nspending power because it regulates individuals who have not\nnecessarily received federal funds of any kind. The Government\ncontends that \u201cfederal fund- ing and logistical support offered to\nStates for their sex-offender-registration-and-notification\nprograms can be effective only if persons required to register\nactually do so\u201d and that \u201cCongress may impose penalties on such\nindividuals as a means of achieving that goal.\u201d Brief for United\nStates 52. But we have never held that Congress gains the power to\nregulate private individuals merely because it provides money to\nthe States in which they reside.Nor does the Commerce\nClause\u2014the enumerated power that the Court has construed most\nbroadly\u2014support \u00a72250(a)(2)(A). Under this Court\u2019s precedents,\nCongress may use its Commerce Clause power to regulate (1)\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018the use of the channels of interstate commerce,\u2019\u00a0\u201d (2)\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018the instrumentalities of interstate commerce, or persons or\nthings in interstate commerce,\u2019\u00a0\u201d and (3) economic activities\nthat \u201c\u00a0\u2018substantially affect interstate commerce.\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nUnited States v. Lopez, 514 U.\u00a0S. 549 \u2013559 (1995); see also\nMorrison, 529 U.\u00a0S., at 617. Section 2250(a)(2)(A) does not\nfall within the first two categories because it is not limited to\nregulating sex offenders who have traveled in interstate commerce.\nInstead, it applies to all federal sex offenders who fail to\nregister, even if they never cross state lines. Nor does\n\u00a72250(a)(2)(A) fall within the third category. Congress may not\nregulate noneconomic activity, such as sex crimes, based on the\neffect it might have on interstate commerce. Cf. Morrison, supra,\nat 617. (\u201cWe .\u00a0.\u00a0. reject the argument that Congress may\nregulate noneconomic, violent criminal conduct based solely on that\nconduct\u2019s aggregate effect on interstate commerce\u201d). In short,\n\u00a72250(a)(2)(A) regulates activity that is neither\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018interstate\u2019\u00a0\u201d nor \u201c\u00a0\u2018commercial,\u2019\u00a0\u201d 687\nF.\u00a03d 232, 253 (CA5 2012), and, thus, it cannot be justified\non the ground that it executes Congress\u2019 power to regulate\ninterstate commerce.Finally, Congress\u2019\npower \u201c[t]o make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the\nland and naval Forces\u201d does not support Kebodeaux\u2019s conviction\nunder \u00a72250(a) (2)(A). Art.\u00a0I, \u00a78, cl. 14. Kebodeaux had long\nsince fully served his criminal sentence for violating Article\n120(b) of the UCMJ and was no longer in the military when Congress\nenacted SORNA. Congress does not retain a general police power over\nevery person who has ever served in the military. See United States\nex rel. Toth v. Quarles, 350 U.\u00a0S. 11, 14 (1955) (\u201cIt has\nnever been intimated by this Court .\u00a0.\u00a0. that Article I\nmilitary jurisdiction could be extended to civilian ex-soldiers who\nhad severed all relationship with the military and its\ninstitutions.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. [G]iven its natural meaning, the\npower granted Congress \u2018To make Rules\u2019 to regulate \u2018the land and\nnaval Forces\u2019 would seem to restrict court-martial jurisdiction to\npersons who are actually members or part of the armed forces\u201d).\nAccordingly, Kebodeaux\u2019s conviction under \u00a72250(a)(2)(A) cannot be\nsustained based on Congress\u2019 power over the military.Moreover, it is clear\nfrom the face of SORNA and from the Government\u2019s arguments that it\nis not directed at \u201ccarrying into Execution\u201d any of the federal\npowers enumerated in the Constitution, Art.\u00a0I, \u00a78, cl. 18, but\nis instead aimed at protecting society from sex offenders and\nviolent child predators. See 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a716901 (\u201cIn\norder to protect the public from sex offenders and offenders\nagainst children, and in response to the vicious attacks by violent\npredators against the victims listed below, Congress in this\nchapter establishes a comprehensive national system for the\nregistration of those offenders\u201d); Tr. of Oral Arg. 3 (\u201cConvicted\nsex offenders pose a serious threat to public safety. When those\nconvictions are entered under Federal law, Congress has the\nauthority to impose both a criminal and a civil sanction for that\nconduct in order to protect the public\u201d); Brief for United States 3\n(same).Protecting society from\nsex offenders and violent child predators is an important and\nlaudable endeavor. See Kennedy v. Louisiana, 554 U.\u00a0S. 407,\n467 (2008) (Alito, J., dissenting) (explaining that, for most\nAmericans, sexual abuse of children is the \u201cepitome of moral\ndepravity\u201d). But \u201cthe Constitution does not vest in Congress the\nauthority to protect society from every bad act that might befall\nit.\u201d Comstock, 560 U.\u00a0S., at 165 (Thomas, J., dissenting). The\npower to protect society from sex offenders is part of the general\npolice power that the Framers reserved to the States or the people.\nSee Amdt. 10; Morrison, supra, at 617 (\u201c[W]e can think of no better\nexample of the police power, which the [Framers] denied the\nNational Government and reposed in the States, than the suppression\nof violent crime and vindication of its victims\u201d); Lopez, supra, at\n561, n.\u00a03. (\u201c\u00a0\u2018[T]he \u2018States possess primary authority\nfor defining and enforcing the criminal law\u2019\u00a0\u201d (quoting Brecht\nv. Abrahamson, 507 U.\u00a0S. 619, 635 (1993) )). [2]The Government has\nfailed to identify any enumerated power that \u00a72250(a)(2)(A)\n\u201ccarr[ies] into Execution\u201d in this case. Accordingly, I would hold\nthat \u00a72250(a)(2)(A) and the registration requirements that it\nenforces are unconstitutional as applied to Kebodeaux.IIIIn concluding\notherwise, the Court entirely skips McCulloch\u2019s first\nstep\u2014determining whether the end served by SORNA is \u201cwithin the\nscope of the [C]onstitu- tion.\u201d 4 Wheat., at 421. The Court appears\nto believe that Congress\u2019 power \u201cto \u2018make Rules for the\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. Regulation of the land and naval Forces\u2019\u00a0\u201d\njustifies imposing SORNA\u2019s registration requirements on Kebodeaux.\nAnte, at 6. But not one line of the opinion explains how SORNA is\ndirected at regulating the armed forces. Instead, the Court\nexplains how SORNA and the Wetterling Act serve various ends that\nare not enumerated in the Constitution. Cf. ante, at 12 (explaining\nthat SORNA was designed to \u201ckeep track of more offenders\u201d and\n\u201cencourage States .\u00a0.\u00a0. to adopt its uniform standards\u201d);\nante, at 8 (explaining that the Wetterling Act was designed to\n\u201cprotect the public from .\u00a0.\u00a0. federal sex offenders and\nalleviate public safety concerns\u201d). The Court\u2019s failure to link\nSORNA to any enumerated power results in analysis that is\nuntethered from the Constitution and disregards the admonition that\n\u201c[t]he powers of the legislature are defined, and limited.\u201d\nMarbury, 1 Cranch, at 176.AThe Court\u2019s analysis\nis flawed at every step. It begins by explaining that \u201cat the time\nof his offense Kebodeaux was subject to the federal Wetterling Act,\nan Act that imposed upon him registration requirements very similar\nto those that SORNA later mandated.\u201d [3] Ante, at 4. But that is beside the point. Kebodeaux\nwas convicted of violating SORNA\u2019s registration requirements, not\nthe Wetterling Act\u2019s, and so the relevant question is what\nenumerated power SORNA \u201ccarr[ies] into Execution.\u201d \u201cThe Necessary\nand Proper Clause does not provide Congress with authority to enact\nany law simply because it furthers other laws Congress has enacted\nin the exercise of its incidental authority; the Clause plainly\nrequires a showing that every federal statute \u2018carr[ies] into\nExecution\u2019 one or more of the Federal Government\u2019s enumerated\npowers.\u201d Comstock, 560 U.\u00a0S., at 168 (Thomas, J.,\ndissenting).Nevertheless,\napparently in an effort to bootstrap the Wetterling Act, the Court\nproceeds to determine whether the Wetterling Act (not SORNA) falls\nwithin Congress\u2019 power under the Necessary and Proper Clause. The\nCourt first notes that the Clause \u201c\u00a0\u2018leave[s] to Congress a\nlarge discretion as to the means that may be employed in executing\na given power,\u2019\u00a0\u201d ante, at 7 (quoting Lottery Case, 188\nU.\u00a0S. 321, 355 (1903) )\u2014a fact that is entirely irrelevant\nunder McCulloch\u2019s first step of determining whether the end is\nitself legitimate. The Court then observes that the Necessary and\nProper Clause\u201cauthorizes Congress, in the\nimplementation of other explicit powers, to create federal crimes,\nto confine offenders to prison, to hire guards and other prison\npersonnel, to provide prisoners with medical care and educational\ntraining, to ensure the safety of those who may come into contact\nwith prisoners, to ensure the public\u2019s safety through systems of\nparole and supervised release, and, where a federal prisoner\u2019s\nmental condition so requires, to confine that prisoner civilly\nafter the expiration of his or her term of imprisonment.\u201d Ante, at\n7.From these powers, the Court reasons that the\nWetterling Act is valid because \u201cCongress could reasonably conclude\nthat registration requirements applied to federal sex offenders\nafter their release can help protect the public from those federal\nsex offenders and alleviate public safety concerns.\u201d Ante, at 8. As\nI explained in Comstock, how- ever, this mode of analysis confuses\nthe inquiry. 560 U.\u00a0S. at 168\u2013169 (Thomas, J., dissenting).\n\u201cFederal laws that criminalize conduct .\u00a0.\u00a0. , establish\nprisons for those who engage in that conduct, and set rules for the\ncare and treatment of prisoners awaiting trial or serving a\ncriminal sentence\u201d are only valid if they \u201c\u00a0\u2018Execut[e]\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nan enumer- ated power. Id., at 169. Here, for example, Congress has\nauthority to enact Article 120(b) of the UCMJ, to enforce that\nprovision against military personnel who violate it, and to confine\nthem in a military prison while they are awaiting trial and serving\na sentence. All of those actions \u201ccarr[y] into Execution\u201d Congress\u2019\npower to promote order and discipline within the military by\nregulating the conduct of military personnel. Art.\u00a0I, \u00a78, cl.\n14.But the enumerated\npower that justified Kebodeaux\u2019s conviction does not justify\nrequiring him to register as a sex offender now that he is a\ncivilian. If Kebodeaux were required to register as part of his\ncriminal sentence, then registration would help execute the power\nthat justifies his conviction. The court-martial here, however, did\nnot impose registration requirements at Kebodeaux\u2019s sentencing. See\nante, at 8 (acknowledging that registration is a \u201ccivil\nrequirement\u201d and was \u201cnot a specific condition of Kebodeaux\u2019s\nrelease\u201d). Enacted long after Kebodeaux had completed his sentence,\nSORNA cannot be justified as a punishment for the offense Kebodeaux\ncommitted while in the military because retroactively increasing\nhis punishment would violate the Ex Post Facto Clause. See Peugh v.\nUnited States, 569 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 8)\n(explaining that laws that \u201c\u00a0\u2018inflic[t] a greater punishment\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. than the law annexed to the crime .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nwhen committed\u2019\u00a0\u201d violate the Ex Post Facto Clause) (quoting\nCalder v. Bull, 3 Dall. 386, 390 (1798)); Peugh, supra, at ___\n(Thomas, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 11) (explaining that \u201claws\nretroactively increasing the punishment were .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nunderstood to be ex post facto at the time of the found- ing\u201d). As\nthe Court below correctly recognized, \u201cbecause SORNA\u2019s registration\nrequirements are civil and were enacted after Kebodeaux committed\nhis crime, the [G]overnment cannot justify their constitutionality\non the ground that they merely punish Kebodeaux for the crime he\ncommitted while in the military.\u201d 687 F.\u00a03d, at 239. The only\njustification for SORNA that the Government has advanced is\nprotection of the public, but that justification has nothing to do\nwith Congress\u2019 power to regulate the armed forces. [4]Finally, the Court\nasserts that the Wetterling Act is reasonable because it \u201ctook\nstate interests into account by, for the most part, requiring\nreleased federal offenders to register in accordance with state\nlaw,\u201d and its requirements are \u201creasonably narrow and precise.\u201d\nAnte, at 10. But the degree to which the Wetterling Act or SORNA\naccommodates State interests and intrudes on the lives of\nindividuals subject to registration is irrelevant because the\nSupremacy Clause makes federal law supreme. See Art.\u00a0VI,\ncl.\u00a02. \u201cAs long as it is acting within the powers granted it\nunder the Constitution, Congress may impose its will on the\nStates.\u201d Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U.\u00a0S. 452, 460 (1991) . The\nfact that the Wetterling Act and SORNA may be \u201cnarrow\u201d and \u201c[take]\nstate interests into account,\u201d ante, at 10, is \u201cnot a matter of\nconstitutional necessity, but an act of legislative grace.\u201d\nComstock, 560 U.\u00a0S., at 178 (Thomas, J., dissenting). These\nfactors have no place in deciding whether a law \u201cExecut[es]\u201d an\nenumerated power.BThe Court not only\nignores the limitations on Congress\u2019 power set forth in the\nConstitution, but it also ignores the limits that it marked just\nthree years ago in Comstock. In that case, this Court held that\nCongress has power under the Necessary and Proper Clause to enact\n18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a74248, which authorizes the Federal\nGovernment to civilly commit \u201csexually dangerous persons\u201d beyond\nthe date it lawfully could hold them on a charge or conviction for\na federal crime. Comstock, 560 U.\u00a0S., at 142. The Court\nrebuffed the assertion that it was conferring a general police\npower on Congress by asserting that \u00a74248 was \u201climited to\nindividuals already \u2018in the custody of the\u2019 Federal Government.\u201d\nId., at 148. The Solicitor General even conceded at oral argument\nthat \u201cthe Federal Government would not have .\u00a0.\u00a0. the\npower to commit a person who .\u00a0.\u00a0. has been released from\nprison and whose period of supervised release is also completed\u201d\nbecause \u201cat that point the State police power over a person has\nbeen fully reestablished.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. in United States v.\nComstock O. T. 2009, No. 08\u20131224, p.\u00a09. The Court and the\nGovernment today abandon even that meager restriction, which itself\nlies far beyond the constitutional limits. Kebodeaux was no longer\nin federal custody when Congress enacted SORNA, yet the Court\ndisregards the fact that, even under Comstock, release from prison\nand supervised release terminates any hold the Federal Government\nmight otherwise have and \u201cfully reestablishe[d]\u201d the State\u2019s police\npower over that individual.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*The Framers believed\nthat the division of powers between the Federal Government and the\nStates would protect individual liberty. See New York v. United\nStates, 505 U.\u00a0S. 144, 181 (1992) (\u201c[T]he Constitution divides\nauthority between federal and state governments for the protection\nof individuals. State sovereignty is not just an end in itself:\n\u2018Rather, federalism secures to citizens the liberties that derive\nfrom the diffusion of sovereign power\u2019\u00a0\u201d (quoting Coleman v.\nThompson, 501 U.\u00a0S. 722, 759 (1991) (Blackmun, J.,\ndissenting)).

Compare with\n(2000 ed.). It is simply incorrect to minimize that change by\nsaying that Kebodeaux received only a day more than he could have\nreceived for failing to register under the Wetterling Act. Ante, at\n2 (Roberts, C.\u00a0J., concurring in judgment). The \u201clegally\nprescribed range is the penalty affixed to the crime,\u201d Alleyne v.\nUnited States, ante, at 11, and SORNA increased that range\nsignificantly. SORNA also requires that a sex offender who moves\nupdate his registration within three days of moving, instead of\nseven. Compare with App. to Pet. for Cert. 167a\u2013168a. Thus, a\nperson can be convicted under SORNA for conduct that would have\ncomplied with the Wetterling Act.4The Chief Justice\ncontends that Congress has authority to impose registration as a\nconsequence of Kebodeaux\u2019s conviction because \u201c[a] servicemember\nwill be less likely to violate a relevant military regulation if he\nknows that, having done so, he will be required to register as a\nsex offender years into the future.\u201d Ante, at 2. But SORNA could\nnot possibly have deterred Kebodeaux from violating any military\nregulation because it was enacted after he left the military.\nJustice Alito contends that, by trying members of the military in a\nmilitary court, Congress exacerbated \u201cthe possibility that a\nconvicted sex offender may escape [the state] registration\n[system],\u201d and that SORNA is necessary and proper to correct this\nproblem. Ante, at 3 (opinion concurring in judgment). But Justice\nAlito has not identified any enumerated power that gives Congress\nauthority to address this supposed problem, and there is no\nevidence that such a problem exists. Indeed, Texas has indicated\nthat SORNA undermines its registration system, rather than making\nit more effective. See Letter from Jeffrey S. Boyd, General Counsel\nand Acting Chief of Staff, Texas Office of the Governor, to Linda\nBaldwin, Director, SMART Office 1 (Aug. 17, 2011) (\u201cAlthough we in\nTexas certainly appreciate and agree with the stated goals of\nSORNA, the adoption of this \u2018one-size-fits-all\u2019 federal legislation\nin Texas would in fact undermine the accomplishment of those\nobjectives in Texas, just as it would in most other states\u201d),\nonlineat\nhttp://www.ncleg.net/documentsites/committees/JLOCJPS/October%2013,%202011%20Meeting/RD_SORNA_General_Information_2011-10-13.pdf\n(as visited June 21, 2013, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case\nfile).",
