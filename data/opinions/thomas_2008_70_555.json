S. ____ (2008)SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESNO. 07-562ALTRIA GROUP, INC., et\u00a0al., PETITIONERSv.STEPHANIE GOOD et\u00a0al.on writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the first circuit[December 15, 2008]Justice Thomas, with whom The\nChief Justice, Justice Scalia, and Justice Alito join,\ndissenting.This appeal requires the Court to\nrevisit its decision inCipollonev.Liggett Group,\nInc.,505 U. S. 504(1992). As in that case,\nthe question before us is whether state-law claims alleging that\ncigarette manufacturers misled the public about the health effects\nof cigarettes are pre-empted by the Federal Cigarette Labeling and\nAdvertising Act, as amended in 1969 (Labeling Act or Act). The\nLabeling Act requires that specific health warnings be placed on\nall cigarette packaging and advertising, 15 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71333, in\norder to eliminate \u201cdiverse, nonuniform, and confusing cigarette\nlabeling and advertising regulations with respect to any\nrelationship between smoking and health,\u201d \u00a71331. To that end, \u00a75(b)\nof the Labeling Act pre-empts any \u201crequirement or prohibition based\non smoking and health \u2026 imposed under State law with respect to the\nadvertising or promotion of any cigarettes.\u201d \u00a71334(b).Whether \u00a75(b) pre-empts state common-law\nclaims divided the Court inCipollone. The plurality\nopinion found some claims expressly pre-empted and others not,\ndepending on whether \u201cthe legal duty that is the predicate of\nthe common-law damagesaction constitutes a requirement or\nprohibition based on smoking and health \u2026 imposed under State law\nwith respect to \u2026 advertising or promotion.\u201d 505 U. S., at 524\n(internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis added). A majority of\nthe Court disagreed with the plurality\u2019s predicate-duty approach.Id.,at 543 (Blackmun, J., concurring in part, concurring\nin judgment in part, and dissenting in part);id.,at\n552\u2013554 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting\nin part). In particular, Justice Scalia recognized that the\nplurality\u2019s interpretation of \u00a75(b) created an unworkable test for\npre-emption with little or no relationship to the text of the\nstatute.Id., at 544, 555\u2013556. The intervening years have\nvindicated Justice Scalia\u2019s critical assessment; the lower courts\nhave consistently expressed frustration at the difficulty in\napplying theCipolloneplurality\u2019s test. Moreover, this\nCourt\u2019s recent pre-emption decisions have undermined, and in some\ncases overruled, central aspects of the plurality\u2019s atextual\napproach to express pre-emption generally,Riegelv.Medtronic, Inc., 552 U. S. ___ (2008), and to \u00a75(b) of the\nLabeling Act specifically,Lorillard Tobacco Co.v.Reilly,533\nU. S. 525(2001).The majority today ignores these problems and\nadopts the methodology of theCipolloneplurality as\ngoverning law. As a consequence, the majority concludes that\nstate-law liability for deceiving purchasers about the health\neffects of smoking light cigarettes is not a \u201crequirement or\nprohibition based on smoking and health\u201d under the Labeling Act.\nThe Court\u2019s fidelity toCipolloneis unwise and\nunnecessary. The Court should instead provide the lower courts with\na clear test that advances Congress\u2019 stated goals by interpreting\n\u00a75(b) to expressly pre-empt any claim that \u201cimposes an obligation \u2026\nbecause of the effect of smoking upon health.\u201dCipollone,supra,at 554 (opinion of Scalia, J.).Respondents\u2019 lawsuit under the Maine Unfair\nTrade Practices Act (MUTPA), Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 5, \u00a7207\n(Supp. 2008), is expressly pre-empted under \u00a75(b) of the Labeling\nAct. The civil action is premised on the allegation that the\ncigarette manufacturers misled respondents into believing that\nsmoking light cigarettes would be healthier for them than smoking\nregular cigarettes. A judgment in respondents\u2019 favor will thus\nresult in a \u201crequirement\u201d that petitioners represent the effects of\nsmoking on health in a particular way in their advertising and\npromotion of light cigarettes. Because liability in this case is\nthereby premised on the effect of smoking on health, I would hold\nthat respondents\u2019 state-law claims are expressly pre-empted by\n\u00a75(b) of the Labeling Act. I respectfully dissent.IInCipollone, a smoker\nand her spouse brought state common-law claims for fraud, breach of\nwarranty, and failure to warn against cigarette manufacturers for\ntheir alleged failure to adequately disclose the health risks of\nsmoking. 505 U. S., at 509. As here, the cigarette manufacturer\nasserted that the claims were pre-empted by \u00a75(b) of the Labeling\nAct.In deciding the case, the Court\ncould not agree on the meaning of the Labeling Act\u2019s express\npre-emption provision. It produced three separate opinions, none of\nwhich reflected the views of a majority of Justices. Relying\nheavily on a \u201cpresumption against the pre-emption of state police\npower regulations,\u201d a plurality opinion by Justice Stevens settled\non a \u201cnarrow reading\u201d of the Labeling Act that tested \u00a75(b)\u2019s\npre-emptive effect under a claim-by-claim approach.Id.,at 524. This approach considered each state-law claim and asked\nwhether it is predicated \u201con a duty \u2018based on smoking and\nhealth.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId.,at 528; see alsoid.,at\n524. If so, the claim is pre-empted.Id., at 524, 528. If,\nhowever, the claim is predicated on a \u201cmore general obligation\u201d\nunder state law, it may proceed.Id.,at 528\u2013529.Applying a test that it conceded lacked\n\u201ctheoretical elegance,\u201did., at 530, n.\u00a027, the\nplurality held that the failure-to-warn claims were pre-empted \u201cto\nthe extent that those claims rel[ied] on omissions or inclusions in\n\u2026 advertising or promotions\u201d of cigarettes.Id.,at 531.\nThe same was true for one of the fraud claims, which alleged that\nthe cigarette manufacturers had used their advertising to\nneutralize the federally required warning labels.Id., at\n527\u2013528. The plurality determined that these claims were\n\u201cpredicated on a state-law prohibition against statements \u2026 that\ntend to minimize the health hazards associated with smoking.\u201dId., at 527. Thus, according to the plurality, these\nstate-law claims sought recovery under the theory that the\ncigarette manufacturer breached a duty based on smoking or health.\nBut the plurality found that the other fraud claim, which alleged\nmisrepresentation or concealment of a material fact, was not\npre-empted because it was based on a more general state-law\nobligation: \u201cthe duty not to deceive.\u201dId.,at\n528\u2013529.Justice Blackmun, writing for three Justices,\ndeparted from the plurality on the antecedent question whether the\nLabeling Act pre-empted state common-law damages claims at all.Id.,at 535\u2013542 (opinion, joined by Kennedy and Souter,\nJJ., concurring in part, concurring in judgment in part, and\ndissenting in part). He concluded that the phrase \u201c\u00a0\u2018State\nlaw\u2019\u00a0\u201d in \u00a75(b) referred only to \u201cpositive enactments such as\nstatutes and regulations.\u201dId.,at 535. But Justice\nBlackmun specifically noted that even if state common-law claims\nwere within the scope of the Labeling Act, he could not join the\nplurality\u2019s claim-by-claim approach because he \u201cperceive[d] no\nprincipled basis for many of the plurality\u2019s asserted distinctions\namong the common-law claims.\u201dId.,at 543. Justice\nBlackmun wrote that Congress could not have \u201cintended to create\nsuch a hodgepodge of allowed and disallowed claims when it amended\nthe pre-emption provision in 1970,\u201d and lamented the \u201cdifficulty\nlower courts w[ould] encounter in attempting to implement\u201d the\nplurality\u2019s test.Id.,at 543\u2013544.Justice Scalia, writing for two Justices, also\nfaulted the plurality for its claim-by-claim approach.Id.,at 544\u2013556 (opinion, joined by Thomas, J., concurring\nin judgment in part and dissenting in part). Although he agreed\nwith the plurality that the phrase \u201c\u00a0\u2018State law\u2019\u00a0\u201d in\n\u00a75(b) encompassed state common-law claims as well as state statutes\nand regulations,id.,at 548\u2013549, Justice Scalia objected\nto the plurality\u2019s invocation of a presumption against pre-emption\nto narrowly interpret \u00a75(b),id., at 544, 545\u2013547. Because\nCongress had expressed its intent to pre-empt state law by enacting\n\u00a75(b), the Court\u2019s \u201cresponsibility [was] to apply to the text\nordinary principles of statutory construction.\u201dId.,at\n545.[Footnote 1] By employing\nits \u201cnewly crafted doctrine of narrow construction,\u201d Justice Scalia\nwrote, the plurality arrived at a cramped and unnatural\nconstruction of \u00a75(b) that failed to give effect to the statutory\ntext.Id., at 544\u2013548.Applying \u201cordinary principles\u201d of statutory\nconstruction,id.,at 548, Justice Scalia determined that\nthe proper test for pre-emption of state-law claims under \u00a75(b) was\nfar less complicated than the plurality\u2019s claim-by-claim approach.\nAs he explained, \u201c[o]nce one is forced to select aconsistentmethodology for evaluating whether a given\nlegal duty is \u2018based on smoking and health,\u2019 it becomes obvious\nthat the methodology must focus not upon the ultimate source of the\nduty \u2026 but upon its proximate application.\u201dId.,at 553.\nThis \u201cproximate application\u201d test, therefore, focuses not on the\nstate-law duty invoked by the plaintiff, but on the effect of the\nsuit on the cigarette manufacturer\u2019s conduct\u2014i.e., the\n\u201crequirement\u201d or \u201cprohibition\u201d that would be imposed under state\nlaw. Put simply, if, \u201cwhatever the source of the duty, [the claim]\nimposes an obligation \u2026 because of the effect of smoking upon\nhealth,\u201d it is pre-empted.Id.,at 554; see alsoid.,at 555 (\u201cThe test for pre-emption in this setting\nshould be one of practical compulsion,i.e., whether the\nlaw practically compels the manufacturers to engage in behavior\nthat Congress has barred the States from prescribing directly\u201d).\nJustice Scalia also seconded Justice Blackmun\u2019s concern that the\nlower courts would find the plurality\u2019s distinctions between\nmaterially identical state-law claims to be incapable of\napplication: \u201cA disposition that raises more questions than it\nanswers does not serve the country well.\u201dId.,at 556.IISixteen years later, we must\nconfrontCipolloneto resolve the question presented in\nthis case: whether respondents\u2019 class-action claims for fraudulent\nmarketing under the MUTPA are pre-empted by \u00a75(b) of the Labeling\nAct. The majority adheres toCipollonebecause it\n\u201cremain[s] persuaded\u201d that the plurality\u2019s construction of the\n\u00a75(b) was \u201c\u00a0\u2018fair.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAnte,at 13\u201314. I\ndisagree. The Court should discard theCipolloneplurality\u2019s ill-conceived predicate-duty approach and replace it\nwith Justice Scalia\u2019s far more workable and textually sound\n\u201cproximate application\u201d test.The majority does not assert that\ntheCipolloneplurality opinion is binding precedent, and\nrightly so. Because the \u201cplurality opinion \u2026 did not represent the\nviews of a majority of the Court, we are not bound by its\nreasoning.\u201dCTS Corp.v.Dynamics Corp. of\nAmerica,481 U.\nS. 69, 81 (1987) (footnote omitted). At most,Cipolloneis a \u201cpoint of reference for further\ndiscussion.\u201dTexasv.Brown,460 U. S. 730, 737\n(1983) (plurality opinion). But even if the plurality opinion had\nsome force beyond its mere persuasive value, it nevertheless should\nbe abandoned. It is unworkable; it has been overtaken by more\nrecent decisions of this Court; and it cannot be reconciled with a\ncommonsense reading of the text of \u00a75(b).AAs predicted by a majority of the\nJustices inCipollone, the plurality opinion\u2019s\nclaim-by-claim approach has proved unworkable in the lower federal\ncourts and state courts. The District Court in this case properly\nobserved that \u201ccourts remain divided about what the decision means\nand how to apply it\u201d and that \u201cCipollone\u2019s distinctions,\nthough clear in theory, defy clear application.\u201d 436\nF.\u00a0Supp.\u00a02d 132, 142 (Me. 2006). Other courts have\nexpressed similar frustration with theCipolloneframework. See,e.g., Glassnerv.R.\u00a0J. Reynolds\nTobacco Co., 223 F.\u00a03d 343, 348 (CA6 2000) (\u201cApplying the\nplurality opinion inCipolloneto the Complaint in the\npresent case is no easy task\u201d);Huddlestonv.R.\u00a0J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., 66 F.\u00a0Supp.\u00a02d\n1370, 1380 (ND Ga. 1999) (\u201cIt would be an understatement to say\nthat it is difficult to apply the plurality opinion inCipolloneto the Amended Complaint in this case. It is an\nimpossibility\u201d);In\u00a0re Welding Fume Prods. Liability\nLitigation, 364 F.

S. 111, 116\n(1965);Federal Election Comm\u2019nv.Wisconsin Right to\nLife, Inc., 551 U. S. ___, ___ (2007) (slip op., at 20)\n(Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment)\n(\u201cStare decisisconsiderations carry little weight when an\nerroneous \u2018governing decisio[n]\u2019 has created an \u2018unworkable\u2019 legal\nregime\u201d (quotingPaynev.Tennessee,501 U. S. 808, 827\n(1991)). We owe far more to the lower courts, which depend on this\nCourt\u2019s guidance, and to litigants, who must conform their actions\nto the Court\u2019s interpretation of federal law. TheCipolloneplurality\u2019s test for pre-emption under \u00a75(b)\nshould be abandoned for this reason alone.BFurthermore, in the years sinceCipollonewas decided, this Court has altered its\ndoctrinal approach to express pre-emption. TheCipolloneplurality justified what it described as the \u201ctheoretical\n[in]elegance\u201d of its construction of \u00a75(b) by relying on the\npresumption against pre-emption, which, it argued, required a\nnarrow, but \u201cfair,\u201d construction of the statute. 505 U. S., at 530,\nn.\u00a027. See,e.g.,id.,at 518 (majority\nopinion) (\u201cThis presumption reinforces the appropriateness of a\nnarrow reading of \u00a75\u201d);id.,at 523 (plurality opinion)\n(\u201c[W]e must \u2026 narrowly construe the precise language of \u00a75(b)\u201d);id.,at 524 (\u00a75(b) must be given \u201ca fair but narrow\nreading\u201d);id.,at 529 (\u201c[W]e conclude that the phrase\n\u2018based on smoking and health\u2019 fairly but narrowly construed does\nnot encompass the more general duty not to make fraudulent\nstatements\u201d). Of course, as Justice Scalia explained, there was\nnothing \u201cfair\u201d about imposing an artificially narrow construction\non the Labeling Act\u2019s pre-emption provision. Seeid.,at\n545 (explaining that the presumption against pre-emption \u201cdissolves\nonce there is conclusive evidence of intent to pre-empt in the\nexpress words of the statute itself\u00a0\u201d).SinceCipollone, the\nCourt\u2019s reliance on the presumption against pre-emption has waned\nin the express pre-emption context. In 2002, for example, the Court\nunanimously explained that the \u201ctask of statutory construction must\nin the first instance focus on the plain wording of the [express\npre-emption] clause, which necessarily contains the best evidence\nof Congress\u2019 pre-emptive intent.\u201dSprietsmav.Mercury\nMarine,537 U.\nS. 51, 62\u201363 (internal quotation marks omitted). Without\nreferring to any presumption against pre-emption, the Court decided\nthat the Federal Boat Safety Act of 1971\u2019s express pre-emption\nprovision did not pre-empt state-law claims.Id.,at\n62\u201364. Most other decisions sinceCipollonealso have\nrefrained from invoking the presumption in the context of express\npre-emption. See,e.g.,Rowev.New Hampshire\nMotor Transp. Assn., 552 U. S. ___ (2008);Engine Mfrs.\nAssn.v.South Coast Air Quality Management Dist.,541 U. S. 246(2004);Buckman Co.v.Plaintiffs\u2019 Legal Comm.,531 U. S. 341(2001);United Statesv.Locke,529 U. S. 89(2000);Geierv.American Honda Motor Co.,529 U. S. 861(2000).The Court has invoked the presumption\nsporadically during this time frame. As the majority notes,ante,at 5,Medtronic, Inc.v.Lohr,518 U. S. 470(1996), applied the presumption against pre-emption in deciding\nthat the federal manufacturing and labeling requirements of the\nMedical Device Amendments of 1976 (MDA) did not pre-empt state\ncommon-law claims.Id., at 500\u2013501. LikeCipollonebefore it,Lohrproduced a fractured\ndecision featuring three opinions. 518 U. S., at 474 (opinion of\nStevens, J.),id., at 503 (Breyer, J., concurring in part\nand concurring in judgment),id., at 509 (O\u2019Connor, J.,\nconcurring in part and dissenting in part). And, likeCipollone,Lohr\u2019s approach to express pre-emption\npredates the Court\u2019s recent jurisprudence on the topic. In fact,\nthis Court last year revisited the pre-emption provision of the\nMDA, 21 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7360k(a)(1), and did not employ any\npresumption against pre-emption.Riegelv.Medtronic,\nInc., 552 U. S. ___ (2008). Seeinfra, at\n11-13.[Footnote 2]More recently, inReilly,533\nU. S. 525, a case revisiting the meaning of \u00a75(b) of the\nLabeling Act, the Court briefly alluded to the presumption, but did\nnot rely on it to reach its decision. Seeid.,at 541\u2013542,\n546\u2013551. Indeed, the Court\u2019s cursory treatment of the presumption\ninReillystands in stark contrast to the First Circuit\ndecision it reversed; the First Circuit relied heavily on the \u201cfull\nforce\u201d of the presumption to determine that the regulations at\nissue were not pre-empted. SeeConsolidated Cigar Corp.v.Reilly, 218 F.\u00a03d 30, 38\u201341 (2000). This Court, in\noverturning that judgment, declined to employ the presumption in\nits construction of \u00a75(b). SeeReilly, 533 U. S., at\n546\u2013551. Justice Stevens highlighted this very point in dissent,\narguing that if the presumption had been faithfully applied, the\nresult would have been different.Id., at 591\u2013593.The majority also relies onBatesv.Dow Agrosciences LLC,544 U. S. 431(2005),\nwhere the presumption was again mentioned, but only in dicta. As inReilly, the presumption did not drive the Court\u2019s\nconstruction of the statute at issue. 544 U. S., at 449 (explaining\nthat the presumption meant just that the holding of no pre-emption\nwould have been the same \u201ceven if [respondent\u2019s] alternative\n[construction of the statute] were just as plausible as our reading\nof the text\u201d); see alsoid.,at 457 (Thomas, J.,\nconcurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part) (agreeing\nthat the case should be vacated and remanded and reiterating that\nthe \u201cpresumption does not apply \u2026 when Congress has included within\na statute an express pre-emption provision\u201d). At bottom, although\nthe Court\u2019s treatment of the presumption against pre-emption has\nnot been uniform, the Court\u2019s express pre-emption cases sinceCipollonehave marked a retreat from reliance on it to\ndistort the statutory text.If any doubt remained, it was eliminated last\nTerm inRiegel. The question inRiegel, as noted\nabove, was whether the MDA expressly pre-empts state common-law\nclaims \u201cchallenging the safety and effectiveness of a medical\ndevice given premarket approval by the Food and Drug\nAdministration.\u201d 552 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 1). Over the\ndissent of one Justice, the Court held that the state-law claims\nwere pre-empted because the requirements the plaintiffs sought to\nimpose were \u201c\u00a0\u2018different from, or in addition to, any\nrequirement applicable \u2026 to the device\u2019\u00a0\u201d under federal law.Id.,at ___ (slip op., at 2) (quoting 21 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7360k(a)(1)). The Court interpreted the statute without reference\nto the presumption or any perceived need to impose a narrow\nconstruction on the provision in order to protect the police power\nof the States. Rather, the Court simply construed the MDA in\naccordance with ordinary principles of statutory construction.This was not accidental. The dissent focused\non the Court\u2019s refusal to invoke the presumption in order to save\nthe state-law claims from pre-emption. 552 U. S., at ___ (slip op.,\nat ___) (opinion of Ginsburg, J.). The dissent was adamant that\n\u201c[f]ederal laws containing a preemption clause do not automatically\nescape the presumption against pre-emption.\u201dIbid.(slip\nop., at 2\u20133);id.,at ___ (slip op., at 3) (\u201cWhere the\ntext of a pre-emption clause is open to more than one plausible\nreading, courts ordinarily \u2018accept the reading that disfavors\npre-emption\u2019\u00a0\u201d (quotingBates,supra,at\n449)). In accordance with the presumption, the dissent would have\nfound the state-law claims under review to fall beyond the reach of\nthe MDA\u2019s express pre-emption provision. 552 U. S., at ___ (slip\nop., at ___); see alsoid., at ___, n.\u00a08 (slip op.,\nat 6, n.\u00a08);id.,at ___, n.\u00a09 (slip op., at 7,\nn.\u00a09) (rejecting the majority\u2019s construction of \u00a7360(d)\nbecause \u201cthe presumption against pre-emption [is] operative even in\nconstruing a preemption clause\u201d). Given the dissent\u2019s clear call\nfor the use of the presumption against pre-emption, the Court\u2019s\ndecision not to invoke it was necessarily a rejection of any role\nfor the presumption in construing the statute.Justice Stevens also declined to invoke the\npresumption in his opinion.Id.,at ___ (opinion\nconcurring in part and concurring in judgment). In his view, the\n\u201csignificance of the pre-emption provision in the [MDA] was not\nfully appreciated until many years after it was enacted\u201d and,\ntherefore, it is \u201ca statute whose text and general objective cover\nterritory not actually envisioned by its authors.\u201dId.,at\n___ (slip op., at 1). But Justice Stevens\u2019 opinion inRiegel\u2014unlike the majority opinion here, the plurality\nopinion inCipollone, and the dissenting opinion inRiegel\u2014didnotinvoke the presumption to bend the\ntext of the statute to meet the perceived purpose of Congress.\nInstead, Justice Stevens correctly found that \u201c\u00a0\u2018it is\nultimately the provisions of our laws rather than the principal\nconcerns of our legislators by which we are governed.\u2019\u00a0\u201d 552\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 1) (quotingOncalev.Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc.,523 U. S. 75, 79\u201380\n(1998)).In light ofRiegel, there is no\nauthority for invoking the presumption against pre-emption in\nexpress pre-emption cases. The majority here thus turns toLohrto revive the presumption and, in turn, to justify\nits restrictive reading of the Labeling Act\u2019s express pre-emption\nprovision. But, asRiegelplainly shows, the Court is no\nlonger willing to unreasonably interpret expressly pre-emptive\nfederal laws in the name of \u201c\u00a0\u2018congressional purpose,\u2019\u00a0\u201dante, at 14, or because \u201cCongress has legislated in a\nfield traditionally occupied by the States,\u201dante, at 5.\nThe text of the statute must control.Riegelalso underminedCipollonein an even more fundamental way: It conclusively\ndecided that a common-law cause of action imposes a state-law\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018requiremen[t]\u2019\u00a0\u201d that may be pre-empted by federal\nlaw. 552 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 11) (\u201cAbsent other indication,\nreference to a State\u2019s \u2018requirements\u2019 includes its common-law\nduties . . . . Indeed, one would think that tort law, applied by\njuries under a negligence or strict-liability standard, is less\ndeserving of preservation [than regulatory legislation]\u201d). Justice\nBlackmun\u2019s contrary interpretation of \u00a75(b) of the Labeling Act inCipollone, 505 U. S., at 538\u2013539 (opinion concurring in\npart, concurring in judgment in part, and dissenting in part),\nwhich provided the votes necessary for the judgment, thus is no\nlonger tenable. In light ofRiegel\u2019s rejection of the\npresumption against pre-emption relied on by the plurality, as well\nas the definition of \u201crequirements\u201d relied on in Justice Blackmun\u2019s\nconcurring opinion,Cipollone\u2019s approach to express\npre-emption is nothing more than \u201ca remnant of abandoned doctrine.\u201dPlanned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa.v.Casey,505 U. S. 833,\n855 (1992).CTheCipolloneplurality\u2019s reading of \u00a75(b) of the Labeling Act was further\nundermined by this Court\u2019s decision inReilly,533\nU. S. 525. There, the Court confronted regulations imposed by\nthe Massachusetts attorney general on the location of tobacco\nadvertising pursuant to the Commonwealth\u2019s unfair trade practices\nstatute.Id.,at 533\u2013536. The Court found the\nregulations\u2014to the extent they applied to cigarettes\u2014expressly\npre-empted because, although Massachusetts remained free to enact\n\u201cgenerally applicable zoning restrictions,\u201d its imposition of\n\u201cspecial requirements or prohibitions \u2018based on smoking and health\u2019\n\u2018with respect to the advertising or promotion of cigarettes\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nfell within the ambit of \u00a75(b)\u2019s pre-emptive sweep.Id.,at 551.Reillydid not ignoreCipollone. It cited the plurality opinion extensively in\nits discussion of the basic history and text of the Labeling Act.\n533 U. S., at 540\u2013546. But in analyzing whether the regulations\nenacted by the Massachusetts attorney general were expressly\npre-empted, the Court was silent aboutCipollone. 533 U.\nS., at 546\u2013551. Unlike the District Court, which saw \u201cthe central\nquestion for purposes of pre-emption [as] whether the regulations\ncreate[d] a predicate legal duty based on smoking and health,\u201did., at 537, the Court\u2019s substantive examination of the\nregulations under \u00a75(b) included no mention of theCipolloneplurality\u2019s \u201cpredicate duty\u201d test. See 533 U.\nS., at 546\u2013551. Instead, the Court disagreed with \u201cthe Attorney\nGeneral\u2019s narrow construction\u201d of the statute\u2019s \u201c\u00a0\u2018based on\nsmoking and health\u2019\u00a0\u201d language, and concluded that the\nregulations were pre-empted because they were \u201cmotivated by\u201d and\n\u201cintertwined with\u201d the concerns about smoking and health.Id.,at 547\u2013548.Reilly, therefore, cannot be\nreconciled with theCipolloneplurality\u2019s interpretation\nof \u00a75(b) of the Labeling Act. The regulations at issue inReillywere enacted to implement a Massachusetts state law\nimposing a duty against unfair and deceptive trade practices\u2014the\nsame predicate duty asserted under the MUTPA in this case. 533 U.\nS., at 533. The state-law duty at issue inReillywas no\nless general than the state-law duty at issue in this case or the\nstate-law fraud claims confronted inCipollone. Compare\nMass. Gen. Laws, ch.\u00a093A, \u00a72(a) (West 1996) (\u201cUnfair methods\nof competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the\nconduct of any trade or commerce are hereby declared unlawful\u201d),\nwith Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 5, \u00a7207 (Supp. 2008) (\u201cUnfair\nmethods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in\nthe conduct of any trade or commerce are declared unlawful\u201d), andCipollone, supra, at 528 (explaining that the \u201cpredicate\u201d\nof the plaintiff\u2019s fraudulent misrepresentation claim was \u201ca\nstate-law duty not to make false statements of material fact or to\nconceal such facts\u201d). Faithful application of theCipolloneplurality opinion, therefore, would have\nrequired the Court inReillyto uphold the regulations.\nIndeed, Justice Stevens argued as much in his dissent. 533 U. S.,\nat 597 (noting that \u201c[n]ary a word in any of the threeCipolloneopinions supports the thesis that \u00a75 should be\ninterpreted to pre-empt state regulation of the location of signs\nadvertising cigarettes\u201d).And yet, the majority today finds thatReillyandCipolloneare perfectly compatible. It\ncontends that, although the regulations in question inReilly\u201cderived from a general deceptive practices statute\nlike the one at issue in this case,\u201d they were pre-empted because\nthey \u201ctargeted advertising that tended to promote tobacco use by\nchildren instead of prohibiting false or misleading statements.\u201dAnte, at 12. According to the majority, that legal duty\ncontrasts with the regulations here, as \u201c[t]he MUTPA says nothing\nabout either \u2018smoking\u2019 or \u2018health.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAnte,at 13;\nsee alsoante,at 10. But theCipolloneplurality\nexpressly rejected any distinction between targeted regulations\nlike those inReillyand general duties imposed by the\ncommon law. 505 U. S., at 522. In fact, the general duties\nunderlying the failure-to-warn and warning-neutralization claims inCipollone\u2014which the plurality found to be pre-empted\u2014say\nnothing about smoking and health.Id., at 524; see alsoid., at 553 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment in part\nand dissenting in part) (noting that the duty to warn about a\nproduct\u2019s dangers was not \u201cspecifically crafted with an eye toward\n\u2018smoking and health\u2019\u00a0\u201d).Accordingly,Reillyis better\nunderstood as establishing that even a general duty can impose\nrequirements or prohibitions based on smoking and health.Reillyweakened the force of theCipolloneplurality\u2019s \u201cpredicate duty\u201d approach to the pre-emptive effect of\n\u00a75(b) and cast doubt on its continuing utility.DFinally, theCipolloneplurality\u2019s approach should be discarded because its \u201cpredicate\nduty\u201d approach is unpersuasive as an initial matter. In considering\nthe warning-neutralization claim, for example, theCipolloneplurality asserted that the claim is predicated\non a state-law prohibition against minimizing the health risks\nassociated with smoking. 505 U. S., at 527. The Court today\nreaffirms this view.Ante, at 10; see alsoante,\nat 13 (describing \u00a75(b) as expressly pre-empting \u201crules \u2026 that are\nbased on smoking and health\u201d). But every products liability action,\nincluding a failure-to-warn action, applies generally toallproducts. SeeCipollone, supra,at 553\n(opinion of Scalia, J.). Thus, the \u201cduty\u201d or \u201crule\u201d involved in a\nfailure-to-warn claim is no more specific to smoking and health\nthan is a common-law fraud claim based on the \u201cduty\u201d or \u201crule\u201d not\nto use deceptive or misleading trade practices. Yet only for the\nlatter was theCipolloneplurality content to ignore the\ncontext in which the claim is asserted. This shifting level of\ngenerality was identified as a logical weakness in the originalCipolloneplurality decision by a majority of the Court,\n505 U. S., at 543 (Blackmun, J., concurring in part,\nconcurring in judgment in part, and dissenting in part);id., at 553\u2013554 (opinion of Scalia, J.), and it remains\nequally unconvincing today.It is therefore unsurprising\nthat the Court\u2019s defense of the plurality\u2019s confusing test is\nconfined to one sentence and a footnote. Seeante, at\n13\u201314 (\u201cWhile we again acknowledge that our analysis of these\nclaims may lack \u2018theoretical elegance,\u2019 we remain persuaded that it\nrepresents \u2018a fair understanding of congressional purpose\u2019\u00a0\u201d\n(quotingCipollone,supra,at 529\u2013530,\nn.\u00a027));ante,at 10, n.\u00a07. The majority instead\nargues that this approach \u201cfails to explain why Congress would . .\n. permi[t] cigarette manufacturers to engage in fraudulent\nadvertising.\u201dAnte, at 10, n.\u00a07. But no explanation\nis necessary; the text speaks for itself. Congress has pre-empted\nonly those claims that would impose \u201crequirement[s] or\nprohibition[s] based on smoking and health.\u201d 15 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a71334(b). Thus, if cigarette manufacturers were to falsely\nadvertise their products as \u201cAmerican-made,\u201d or \u201cthe official\ncigarette of Major League Baseball,\u201d state-law claims arising from\nthat wrongful behavior would not be pre-empted.Furthermore,\ncontrary to the majority\u2019s policy arguments, faithful application\nof the statutory language does not authorize fraudulent advertising\nwith respect to smoking and health.[Footnote 3] Any misleading promotional statements for\ncigarettes remain subject to federal regulatory oversight under the\nLabeling Act. See \u00a71336. The relevant question thus is not whether\n\u201cpetitioners will be prohibited from selling as \u2018light\u2019 or \u2018low\ntar\u2019 only those cigarettes that are not actually light and do not\nactually deliver less tar and nicotine.\u201dAnte, at 12,\nn.\u00a010. Rather, the issue is whether the Labeling Act allows\nregulators and juries to decide, on a state-by-state basis, whether\npetitioners\u2019 light and low-tar descriptors were in fact fraudulent,\nor instead whether \u00a75(b) charged the Federal Government with\nreaching a comprehensive judgment with respect to this\nquestion.Congress chose a uniform\nfederal standard. Under the Labeling Act, Congress \u201cestablish[ed] a\ncomprehensive Federal Program to deal with cigarette labeling and\nadvertising,\u201d 15 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71331, so that \u201ccommerce and the\nnational economy may . . . not [be] impeded by diverse, nonuniform,\nand confusing cigarette labeling and advertising regulations with\nrespect to any relationship between smoking and health,\u201d\n\u00a71331(2)(B).[Footnote 4] The\nmajority\u2019s distorted interpretation of \u00a75(b) defeats this express\ncongressional purpose, opening the door to an untold number of\ndeceptive-practices lawsuits across the country. The question\nwhether marketing a light cigarette is\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018misrepresentative\u2019\u00a0\u201d in light of compensatory behavior\n\u201cwould almost certainly be answered differently from State to\nState.\u201dCipollone, supra, 505 U. S., at 553 (opinion of\nScalia, J.). This will inevitably result in the nonuniform\nimposition of liability for the marketing of light and/or low-tar\ncigarettes\u2014the precise problem that Congress intended \u00a75(b) to\nremedy.In light of these serious flaws\nin the majority\u2019s approach, even if theCipolloneplurality opinion were binding precedent, the Court \u201cshould not\nhesitate to allow our precedent to yield to the true meaning of an\nAct of Congress when our statutory precedent is \u2018unworkable\u2019 or\n\u2018badly reasoned.\u2019\u00a0\u201dClarkv.Martinez,543 U. S. 371,\n402 (2005) (Thomas, J., dissenting) (quotingHolderv.Hall,512\nU. S. 874, 936 (1994) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment), in\nturn quotingPayne, 501 U.

Where, as here, there is \u201cconfusion\nfollowing a splintered decision,\u201d that \u201cis itself a reason for\nreexamining that decision.\u201dNicholsv.United\nStates,511 U.\nS. 738, 746 (1994). When a decision of this Court has failed to\nproperly interpret a statute, we should not \u201cplace on the shoulders\nof Congress the burden of the Court\u2019s own error.\u201dGirouardv.United States,328 U. S. 61, 69\u201370\n(1946).[Footnote 5]IIIApplying the\nproper test\u2014i.e., whether a jury verdict on respondents\u2019\nclaims would \u201cimpos[e] an obligation\u201d on the cigarette manufacturer\n\u201cbecause of the effect of smoking upon health,\u201dCipollone,supra, at 554 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment in part\nand dissenting in part), respondents\u2019 state-law claims are\nexpressly pre-empted by \u00a75(b) of the Labeling Act. Respondents,\nlongtime smokers of Marlboro Lights, claim that they have suffered\nan injury as a result of petitioners\u2019 decision to advertise these\ncigarettes as \u201clight\u201d and/or \u201clow-tar and low nicotine products.\u201d\n436 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d, at 144\u2013145. They claim that petitioners\nmarketed their cigarettes as \u201clight\u201d and/or \u201clow-tar and\nlow-nicotine products\u201d despite knowledge that light-cigarette\nsmokers would engage in compensatory behavior causing them to\ninhale at least as much tar and nicotine as smokers of regular\ncigarettes.Ibid. Respondents thus allege that they were\nmisled into thinking that they were gaining a health advantage by\nsmoking the light cigarettes,ibid., and, as a result,\npetitioners\u2019 conduct was an \u201cunfair or deceptive act or practice\u201d\nunder the MUTPA. Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 5, \u00a7207; 436 F. Supp.\n2d, at 133.Respondents\u2019\nclaims seek to impose liability on petitioners because of the\neffect that smoking light cigarettes had on their health. The\nalleged misrepresentation here\u2014that \u201clight\u201d and \u201clow-tar\u201d\ncigarettes are not as healthy as advertised\u2014is actionableonlybecause of the effect that smoking light and low-tar\ncigarettes had on respondents\u2019 health. Otherwise, any alleged\nmisrepresentation about the effect of the cigarettes on health\nwould be immaterial for purposes of the MUTPA and would not be the\nsource of the injuries that provided the impetus for the\nclass-action lawsuit. SeeStatev.Weinschenk,\n2005 ME 28, \u00b617, 868 A.\u00a02d 200, 206 (\u201cAn act or practice is\ndeceptive [under the MUTPA] if it is amaterialrepresentation, omission, act or practice that is likely to mislead\nconsumers acting reasonably under the circumstances\u201d (emphasis\nadded)). Therefore, with this suit, respondents seek torequirethe cigarette manufacturers to provide additional\nwarnings about compensatory behavior, or toprohibitthem\nfrom selling these products with the \u201clight\u201d or \u201clow-tar\u201d\ndescriptors. This is exactly the type of lawsuit that is pre-empted\nby the Labeling Act. Cf.Rowe, 552 U. S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 6) (finding pre-emption of a Maine regulation of shipping\nof tobacco products where \u201c[t]he Maine law \u2026 produces the very\neffect that the federal law sought to avoid\u201d).Because the proper test for\npre-emption is to look at the factual basis of a complaint to\ndetermine if a claim imposes a requirement based on smoking and\nhealth, there is no meaningful distinction to be drawn in this case\nbetween common-law failure-to-warn claims and claims under the\nMUTPA.[Footnote 6] As the\nmajority readily admits, both types of claims impose duties with\nrespect to the same conduct\u2014i.e.,the marketing of\n\u201clight,\u201d \u201clow-tar,\u201d and \u201clow-nicotine\u201d cigarettes. Seeante, at 11, n.\u00a09. If the claims arise from identical\nconduct, the claims impose the same requirement or prohibition with\nrespect to that conduct. And when that allegedly wrongful conduct\ninvolves misleading statements about the health effects of smoking\na particular brand of cigarette, the liability and resulting\nrequirement or prohibition are, by definition, based on smoking and\nhealth.Finally, at oral argument,\nrespondents argued that their claims do not impose requirements\nbased on smoking and health because the damages they seek to\nrecover are not based on the effect of smoking on their health;\nrather, respondents are \u201casking \u2026 for the difference in value\nbetween a product [they] thought [they] were buying and a product\n[they] actually bought.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 29. But the requirement\nor prohibition covered by \u00a75(b) is created by the imposition of\nliability for particular conduct\u2014here, the way in which petitioners\nmarketed \u201clight\u201d and \u201clow-tar,\u201d and \u201clow-nicotine\u201d cigarettes\u2014not\nby the manner in which respondents have chosen to measure their\ndamages. No matter how respondents characterize their damages\nclaim, they have not been injured for purposes of the MUTPA, and\nthus cannot recover, unless their decision to purchase the\ncigarettes had a negative effect on their health.In any event, respondents\nsought \u201csuch injunctive relief as may be appropriate\u201d in this case.\nApp. 42a. The MUTPA specifically authorizes \u201cother equitable\nrelief, including an injunction,\u201d to remedy unfair or deceptive\ntrade practices. Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 5, \u00a7213(1) (West 2002).\nAnd a court-crafted injunction prohibiting petitioners from\nmarketing light cigarettes would be no less a requirement or\nprohibition than the regulations found to be pre-empted inReilly. In the end, no matter what form the remedy takes,\nthe liability with respect to the specific claim still creates the\nrequirement or prohibition. When that liability is necessarily\npremised on the effects of smoking on health, as respondents\u2019\nclaims are here, the civil action is pre-empted by \u00a75(b) of the\nLabeling Act.IVThe Court today\nelects to convert theCipolloneplurality opinion into\nbinding law, notwithstanding its weakened doctrinal foundation, its\natextual construction of the statute, and the lower courts\u2019\ninability to apply its methodology. The resulting confusion about\nthe nature of a claim\u2019s \u201cpredicate duty\u201d and inevitable\ndisagreement in the lower courts as to what type of representations\nare \u201cmaterial\u201d and \u201cmisleading\u201d will have the perverse effect of\nincreasing the nonuniformity of state regulation of cigarette\nadvertising, the exact problem that Congress intended \u00a75(b) to\nremedy. It may even force us to yet again revisit the Court\u2019s\ninterpretation of the Labeling Act. Because I believe that\nrespondents\u2019 claims are pre-empted under \u00a75(b) of the Labeling Act,\nI respectfully dissent.Footnote\n1Justice Scalia also criticized\nthe plurality for announcing a new rule that the enactment of an\nexpress pre-emption clause eliminates any consideration of implied\npre-emption. He explained that this new rule created mischief\nbecause, when combined with the presumption against pre-emption, it\nplaced a heavy burden of exactitude on Congress when it wishes to\nsay anything about pre-emption. SeeCipollone, 505 U. S.,\nat 547\u2013548.Footnote\n2Also, as inCipollonev.Liggett Group, Inc.,505 U. S. 504(1992), the fractured\ndecision inLohrwas a source of confusion for the lower\ncourts. SeeKempv.Medtronic, Inc., 231\nF.\u00a03d 216, 224 (CA6 2000) (\u201cThe various courts of appeals that\nhave confronted issues of preemption arising under the MDA have\nstruggled mightily withLohr\u2019s language in an effort to\ndiscern its holding\u201d); see alsoMartinv.Medtronic,\nInc., 254 F.\u00a03d 573, 579 (CA5 2001) (\u201cBecause only parts\nof Justice Stevens\u2019s opinion commanded a majority, extracting the\nfinal meaning ofLohris no easy task. . . . Although\nJustice Breyer\u2019s concurrence very specifically disavows the view\nthat common law duties cannot provide substantive requirements for\nthe purpose of preemption, neither his concurrence nor the\nplurality opinion offers much help to us in developing the point\u201d).\nThe confusion was cleared up inRiegel. Seeinfra, at 11\u201313.Footnote\n3The majority\u2019s policy-based\nattack could just as easily be leveled against its own\ndetermination that the Labeling Act pre-empts failure-to-warn\nclaims. But just as there is no basis in fact or law to contend\nthat the Labeling Act encourages the marketing of hazardous\nproducts without adequate warning labels,ante,at 10, n.\n8, there is no basis to contend that the text of the Labeling Act\npermits fraudulent advertising.Footnote\n4The majority contends that the\nrelatively constrained enforcement power of the Federal Trade\nCommission (FTC) in 1970 undermines any argument that Congress\nintended the Labeling Act to prevent States from regulating\ndeceptive advertising and marketing of cigarettes.Ante,\nat 8, n.\u00a06. I am unwilling to rely on the majority\u2019s\nperception of the relative power of the FTC in 1970 to ignore\nCongress\u2019 stated purpose in enacting the Labeling Act and the plain\nmeaning of the Act\u2019s express pre-emption provision.Footnote\n5The United States, in\nitsamicusbrief and at oral argument, conspicuously\ndeclined to address express pre-emption or defend theCipolloneopinion\u2019s reasoning. See Brief for United States\nasAmicus Curiae14\u201333. Instead, it addressed only the\nquestion of implied pre-emption, an issue I do not reach because of\nmy resolution of the question on express pre-emption.Footnote\n6The majority\u2019s observation\nthat no warning-neutralization claim is at issue in this case,ante, at \u00a011 n.\u00a09, misses the point. The\nprincipal weakness in theCipolloneplurality\u2019s logic is\nnot its distinction between claims for warning neutralization and\nclaims for fraud. It is the fact that the predicate duty underlying\nNew Jersey\u2019s products liability law, from which the majority now\nclaims the warning-neutralization claim derived, seeante,at 11, n.\u00a08, was no more specific to smoking and health than\nthe predicate duty underlying the fraud claim, seeCipollone, 505 U. S., at 552\u2013553 (opinion of Scalia, J.)\n(\u201cEachduty transcends the relationship between the\ncigarette companies and cigarette smokers;neitherduty\nwas specifically crafted with an eye toward \u2018smoking and\nhealth\u2019\u00a0\u201d);id., at 543 (opinion of Blackmun, J.);\nsee alsosupra,at 16. Thus, the products-liability and\nthe fraud claims must stand or fall together. The majority\u2019s\nrefusal to address the logical inconsistency of its approach\nremains as glaring today as it was inCipollone.",
