Ins. Co., 577 U.S. 312, 327 (2016) (Thomas, J.,\nconcurring). The plain text of ERISA suggests a two-part\npre-emption test: (1) do any ERISA provisions govern the same\nmatter as the state law at issue, and (2) does that state law have\na meaningful relationship to ERISA plans? Only if the answers to\nboth are in the affirmative does ERISA displace state law. But our\nprecedents have veered from the text, transforming \u00a71144 into a\n\u201cvague and \u2018potentially boundless\u2019.\u00a0.\u00a0. \u2018purposes and\nobjectives\u2019 pre-emption\u201d clause that relies on \u201cgeneralized notions\nof congressional purposes.\u201dWyethv.Levine,555 U.S.\n555, 587 (2009) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment). Although\nthat approach may allow courts to arrive at the correct result in\nindividual cases, it offers little guidance or predictability. We\nshould instead apply the law as written.IWhen construing a statutory provision, we\nbegin with the text.United Statesv.Alvarez-Sanchez,511 U.S.\n350, 356 (1994). Section 1144(a) provides that certain of\nERISA\u2019s provisions \u201cshall supersede any and all State laws insofar\nas they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan\u201d\nwith certain exceptions not relevant in this case.The term \u201csupersede\u201d precludes reading the\nstatute as categorically pre-empting any state law related to\nemployee benefit plans. Rather, it suggests a replacement or\nsubstitution instead of a blanket pre-emption. See Webster\u2019s Third\nNew International Dictionary 2295 (1976) (defining \u201csupersede\u201d to\nmean, among other things, \u201cto take the place of and outmode by\nsuperiority\u201d);District of Columbiav.Greater Washington\nBd. of Trade,506 U.S.\n125, 135\u2013136 (1992) (Stevens, J., dissenting) (noting the word\n\u201csupersede\u201d is \u201coften overlooked\u201d).Where Congress seeks to pre-empt state lawswithoutreplacing them, it typically uses different words.\nSee,e.g.,84Stat. 88, codified in 15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a71334(b) (stating in a \u201cpreemption\u201d section that \u201c[n]o requirement\nor prohibition based on smoking and health shall be imposed under\nState law with respect to the advertising or promotion of any\ncigarettes the packages of which are labeled in conformity with the\nprovisions of this Act\u201d); 49 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a741713(b)(1) (\u201c[A]\nState .\u00a0.\u00a0. may not enact or enforce a law, regulation,\nor other provision having the force and effect of law related to a\nprice, route, or service of an air carrier\u201d). Congress knows how to\nwrite sweeping pre-emption statutes. But it did not do so here.\nApplying the statutory text, the first step is to ask whether a\nprovision in ERISA governs the same matter as the disputed state\nlaw, and thus could replace it.The next step is to determine whether the state\nlaw \u201crelate[s] to\u201d employee benefit plans. 29 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a71144(a). The Court has expressed concern that aliteralreading of this phrase is so broad that it is meaningless. SeeNew York State Conference of Blue Cross & Blue Shield\nPlansv.Travelers Ins. Co.,514\nU.S. 645, 655 (1995). But many times it is the ordinary, not\nliteralist, meaning that is the better one. See,e.g.,McBoylev.United States,283 U.S.\n25, 26 (1931) (\u201cvehicle\u201d in the 1930s did not include aircraft\nbecause \u201cin everyday speech \u2018vehicle\u2019 calls up the picture of a\nthing moving on land\u201d). \u201c[A] reasonable person conversant with\napplicable social conventions\u201d would not understand \u201crelate to\u201d as\ncovering any state law with a connection to employee benefit plans,\nno matter how remote the connection. Manning, What Divides\nTextualists From Purposivists? 106 Colum. L.\u00a0Rev. 70, 77\n(2006); see alsoCalifornia Div. of Labor Standards\nEnforcementv.Dillingham Constr., N.\u00a0A.,Inc.,519 U.S.\n316, 336 (1997) (Scalia J., concurring) (interpreting \u201crelate\nto\u201d literally would lead to results \u201cno sensible person could have\nintended\u201d). If someone, for instance, asserted that he is \u201crelated\nto Joe,\u201d it would be reasonable to presume a close familial\nrelationship. No one would assume that the speaker was referencing\na mutual tie to Adam and Eve. So too here. A state law needs more\nthan a \u201ctenuous, remote, or peripheral\u201d connection with ERISA plans\nto trigger the statute.Shawv.Delta Air Lines,\nInc.,463 U.S.\n85, 100, n. 21 (1983); cf.Wisconsin Dept. of Revenuev.William Wrigley, Jr., Co.,505 U.S.\n214, 231 (1992) (\u201c\u00a0\u2018the law cares not for\ntrifles\u2019\u00a0\u201d).IIHere, the parties have not pointed to any\nERISA provision that governs the same matter as Act 900. That alone\nshould resolve the case. But the parties certainly cannot be\nfaulted for not raising this argument. Our amorphous precedents\nhave largely ignored this step.E.g., District of Columbia,\n506 U.\u00a0S., at 129.Instead, we have asked only if the state law\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018relate[d] to\u2019\u00a0\u201d ERISA plans.Ibid.But this has\nproved problematic because of \u201chow much state law \u00a71144 would\npre-empt if read literally.\u201dGobeille, 577 U.\u00a0S., at\n328 (Thomas, J., concurring). Instead of reverting to the text,\nhowever, we decided that \u201crelate to\u201d is so \u201cindetermina[te]\u201d that\nit cannot \u201cgive us much help drawing the line.\u201dTravelers,\n514 U.\u00a0S., at 655.Having paid little attention to the actual\nstatutory test, we crafted our own, asking whether the challenged\nstate law frustrates the \u201c\u00a0\u2018objectives\u2019\u00a0\u201d of ERISA.Gobeille, 577 U.\u00a0S., at 320. Under this approach, the\nCourt will declare as pre-empted \u201cstate laws based on perceived\nconflicts with broad federal policy objectives, legislative\nhistory, or generalized notions of congressional purposes that are\nnot embodied within the text of federal law.\u201dWyeth, 555\nU.\u00a0S., at 583 (opinion of Thomas, J.). Our case law states\nthat under an objectives and purposes pre-emption approach, a state\nlaw is pre-empted if it has a \u201creference to\u201d or an \u201cimpermissible\nconnection with\u201d ERISA plans.Gobeille, 577 U.\u00a0S., at\n319\u2013320. But this vague test offered \u201cno more help than\u201d the\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018relate to\u2019\u00a0\u201d one.Travelers, 514 U.\u00a0S., at\n656.Our more recent efforts to further narrow the\ntest have just yielded more confusion. A state law references ERISA\nonly if it \u201c\u00a0\u2018acts immediately and exclusively upon ERISA\nplans.\u00a0.\u00a0. or where the existence of ERISA plans is\nessential to the law\u2019s operation.\u2019\u00a0\u201dGobeille, 577\nU.\u00a0S., at 319\u2013320 (ellipsis in original). A connection with\nERISA plans is impermissible only if it\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018governs.\u00a0.\u00a0. a central matter of plan\nadministration\u2019\u00a0\u201d or \u201c\u00a0\u2018interferes with nationally\nuniform plan administration.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId., at 320.(ellipsis in original).[1]\nAlthough, at first blush, that may seem more precise than asking if\na law \u201crelates to\u201d ERISA, it has proven just as difficult to apply\nconsistently, leading many members of the Court to suggest still\nother methods. See,e.g.,Egelhoffv.Egelhoff,532 U.S.\n141, 152 (2001) (Scalia, J., concurring);Aetna Health\nInc.v.Davila,542 U.S.\n200, 222\u2013224 (2004) (Ginsburg, J., concurring). Instead of\nrelying on this \u201caccordion-like\u201d test that seems to expand or\ncontract depending on the year, Reece, The Accordion Type\nJurisprudence of ERISA Preemption Creates Unnecessary Uncertainty,\n88 UMKC L.\u00a0Rev. 115, 124, n. 71 (2019), perhaps we should just\ninterpret the text as written.IIIStare decisisconcerns need not caution\nagainst a return to the text because the outcomes of our recent\ncases\u2014if not the reasoning\u2014 are generally consistent with a\ntext-based approach. Indeed, sinceTravelersevery state law\nthis Court has held pre-empted involved a matter explicitly\naddressed by ERISA provisions. See,e.g.,Boggsv.Boggs,520 U.S.\n833, 843\u2013854 (1997) (pre-empting state law and discussing ERISA\nprovisions with which it conflicts);Aetna Health, 542\nU.\u00a0S., at 204 (holding that states cannot create new causes of\naction that conflict with ERISA\u2019s \u201c\u00a0\u2018interlocking,\ninterrelated, and interdependent remedial scheme,\u2019\u00a0\u201d located\nin \u00a7502(a) of ERISA).[2]But it is not enough for this Court to reach the\nright conclusions. We should do so in the way Congress instructed.\nIndeed, although we have generally arrived at the conclusions we\nwould arrive at under a text-based approach, our capacious,\nnontextual test encourages departure from the text. The decision\nbelow is testament to that problem. We unanimously reverse that\ndecision today, but we can hardly fault judges when they apply the\namorphous test that we gave them. We can and should do better.Notes1We have also held that a\nstate law might have an impermissible connection with ERISA plans\nif the indirect economic effects of the state law \u201cforce an ERISA\nplan to adopt a certain scheme of substantive coverage or\neffectively restrict its choice of insurers.\u201dNew York State\nConference of Blue Cross & Blue Shield Plansv.Travelers Ins. Co.,514 U.S.\n645, 668 (1995).2The Court has found\nsomething to be \u201ca central matter of plan administration\u201d only when\nthe matter is addressed by ERISA\u2019s text.E.g., Egelhoffv.Egelhoff,532 U.S.\n141, 148 (2001);Gobeillev.Liberty Mut. Ins.\nCo., 577 U.\u00a0S., at 321\u2013322. And if the state law\ninterferes with national uniformity but ERISA does not address the\nmatter, we have held that the matter in question does not require\nuniformity.Travelers, 514 U.\u00a0S., at 662;ante,\nat 5, (\u201cnot every state law that.\u00a0.\u00a0. causes some\ndisuniformity in plan administration\u201d is pre-empted). We have also\nheld that ERISA does not pre-empt state laws regulating ERISA plans\nengaging in activity not regulated by ERISA, like running a\nhospital. SeeDe Buonov.NYSA\u2013ILA Medical and Clinical\nServices Fund,520 U.S.\n806(1997). That makes sense because ERISA has nothing to say\nabout those activities.",
