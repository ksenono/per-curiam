Those\ndocuments are not part of the appellate record. See Fed. Rule App.\nProc. 10(a). We have \u201cconsistently condemned\u201d attempts to influence\nour decisions by submitting \u201cadditional or different evidence that\nis not part of the certified record.\u201d S. Shapiro, K. Geller, T.\nBishop, E. Hartnett, & D. Himmelfarb, Supreme Court Practice\n\u00a713.11(k), p. 743 (10th ed. 2013). Perhaps Blake\u2019s newfound\ndocuments are subject to judicial notice as public records. See\nFed. Rule Evid. 201. But I would not take such notice for the first\ntime in this Court. It appears that Blake had a chance to submit\nmany of his documents to the lower courts and failed to do so.\nTaking notice of the documents encourages gamesmanship and\nfrustrates our review. I would let the Court of Appeals decide on\nremand whether to supplement the record, see Fed. Rule App. Proc.\n10(e), or take notice of Blake\u2019s lodgings.",
