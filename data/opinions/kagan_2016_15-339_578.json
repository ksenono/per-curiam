The court below adopted an\nunwritten \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d exception to that provision,\npermitting some prisoners to pursue litigation even when they have\nfailed to exhaust available administrative remedies. Today, we\nreject that freewheeling approach to exhaustion as inconsistent\nwith the PLRA. But we also underscore that statute\u2019s built-in\nexception to the exhaustion requirement: A prisoner need not\nexhaust remedies if they are not \u201cavailable.\u201d The briefs and other\nsubmissions filed in this case suggest the possibility that the\naggrieved inmate lacked an available administrative remedy. That\nissue remains open for consideration on remand, in light of the\nprinciples stated below.IRespondent Shaidon Blake is an inmate in a\nMaryland prison. On June 21, 2007, two guards\u2014James Madigan and\npetitioner Michael Ross\u2014undertook to move him from his regular cell\nto the facility\u2019s segregation unit. According to Blake\u2019s version of\nthe facts, Ross handcuffed him and held him by the arm as they left\nthe cell; Madigan followed close behind. Near the top of a flight\nof stairs, Madigan shoved Blake in the back. Ross told Madigan he\nhad Blake under control, and the three continued walking. At the\nbottom of the stairs, Madigan pushed Blake again and then punched\nhim four times in the face, driving his head into the wall. After a\nbrief pause, Madigan hit Blake one last time. Ross kept hold of\nBlake throughout the assault. And when the blows subsided, Ross\nhelped Madigan pin Blake to the ground until additional\nofficersarrived.Later that day, Blake reported the assault to a\nsenior corrections officer. That officer thought Madigan at fault,\nand so referred the incident to the Maryland prison system\u2019s\nInternal Investigative Unit (IIU). Under state law, the IIU has\nauthority to investigate allegations of employee misconduct,\nincluding the use of \u201cexcessive force.\u201d Codeof Md. Regs., tit. 12,\n\u00a711.01.05(A)(3) (2006). After conducting a year-long inquiry into\nthe beating, the IIU issued a final report condemning Madigan\u2019s\nactions, while making no findings with respect to Ross. See App.\n191\u2013195. Madigan resigned to avoid being fired.Blake subsequently sued both guards under 42\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71983, alleging that Madigan had used\nunjustifiable force and that Ross had failed to take protective\naction. The claim against Madigan went to a jury, which awarded\nBlake a judgment of $50,000. But unlike Madigan, Ross raised the\nPLRA\u2019s exhaustion requirement as an affirmative defense, contending\nthat Blake had brought suit without first following the prison\u2019s\nprescribed procedures for obtaining an administrative remedy. As\nset out in Maryland\u2019s Inmate Handbook, that process\u2014called, not\nvery fancifully, the Administrative Remedy Procedure (ARP)\u2014begins\nwith a formal grievance to the prison\u2019s warden; it may also involve\nappeals to the Commissioner of Correction and then the Inmate\nGrievance Office (IGO). See Maryland Div. of Correction, Inmate\nHandbook 30\u201331 (2007). Blake acknowledged that he had not sought a\nremedy through the ARP\u2014because, he thought, the IIU investigation\nserved as a substitute for that otherwise standard process. The\nDistrict Court rejected that explanation and dismissed the suit,\nholding that \u201cthe commencement of an internal investigation does\nnot relieve prisoners from the [PLRA\u2019s] exhaustion requirement.\u201dBlakev.Maynard, No. 8:09\u2013cv\u20132367 (D Md., Nov. 14,\n2012), App. to Pet. for Cert. 38, 2012 WL 5568940, *5.The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit\nreversed in a divided decision. Stating that the PLRA\u2019s \u201cexhaustion\nrequirement is not absolute,\u201d the court adopted an extra-textual\nexception originally formulated by the Second Circuit. 787\nF.\u00a03d 693, 698 (2015). Repeated the Court of Appeals: \u201c[T]here\nare certain \u2018special circumstances\u2019 in which, though administrative\nremedies may have been available[,] the prisoner\u2019s failure to\ncomply with administrative procedural requirements may nevertheless\nhave been justified.\u201dIbid.(quotingGianov.Goord, 380 F.\u00a03d 670, 676 (CA2 2004)). In particular,\nthat was true when a prisoner \u201creasonably\u201d\u2014even though\nmistakenly\u2014\u201cbelieved that he had sufficiently exhausted his\nremedies.\u201d 787 F.\u00a03d, at 695. And Blake, the court concluded,\nfit within that exception because he reasonably thought that \u201cthe\nIIU\u2019s investigation removed his complaint from the typical ARP\nprocess.\u201dId.,at 700. Judge Agee dissented, stating that\nthe PLRA\u2019s mandatory exhaustion requirement is not \u201camenable\u201d to\n\u201c[j]udge-made exceptions.\u201dId.,at 703. This Court granted\ncertiorari. 577 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2015).IIThe dispute here concerns whether the PLRA\u2019s\nexhaustion requirement, \u00a71997e(a), bars Blake\u2019s suit. Statutory\ntext and history alike foreclose the Fourth Circuit\u2019s adoption of a\n\u201cspecial circumstances\u201d exception to that mandate. But Blake\u2019s suit\nmay yet be viable. Under the PLRA, a prisoner need exhaust only\n\u201cavailable\u201d administrative remedies. And Blake\u2019s contention that\nthe prison\u2019s grievance process was not in fact available to him\nwarrants further consideration below.AStatutory interpretation, as we always say,\nbegins with the text, see,e.g., Hardtv.Reliance\nStandard Life Ins. Co., 560 U.\u00a0S. 242, 251 (2010) \u2014but\nhere following that approach at once distances us from the Court of\nAppeals. As Blake acknowledges, that court made no attempt to\nground its analysis in the PLRA\u2019s language. See 787 F.\u00a03d, at\n697\u2013698; Brief for Respondent 47\u201348, n.\u00a020 (labeling the Court\nof Appeals\u2019 rule an \u201cextra-textual exception to the PLRA\u2019s\nexhaustion requirement\u201d). And that failure makes a difference,\nbecause the statute speaks in unambiguous terms opposite to what\nthe Fourth Circuit said.Section 1997e(a) provides: \u201cNo action shall be\nbrought with respect to prison conditions under section 1983 of\nthis title, or any other Federal law, by a prisoner confined in any\njail, prison, or other correctional facility until such\nadministrative remedies as are available are exhausted.\u201d As we have\noften observed, that language is \u201cmandatory\u201d: An inmate \u201cshall\u201d\nbring \u201cno action\u201d (or said more conversationally, may not bring any\naction) absent exhaustion of available administrative remedies.Woodfordv.Ngo, 548 U.\u00a0S. 81, 85 (2006) ;\naccord,Jonesv.Bock, 549 U.\u00a0S. 199, 211 (2007)\n(\u201cThere is no question that exhaustion is mandatory under the\nPLRA\u201d). As later discussed, that edict contains one significant\nqualifier: the remedies must indeed be \u201cavailable\u201d to the prisoner.\nSeeinfra, at 8\u201310. But aside from that exception, the\nPLRA\u2019s text suggests no limits on an inmate\u2019s obligation to\nexhaust\u2014irrespective of any \u201cspecial circumstances.\u201dAnd that mandatory language means a court may\nnot excuse a failure to exhaust, even to take such circumstances\ninto account. SeeMillerv.French, 530 U.\u00a0S.\n327, 337 (2000) (explaining that \u201c[t]he mandatory \u2018shall\u2019\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. normally creates an obligation impervious to\njudicial discretion\u201d). No doubt, judge-made exhaustion doctrines,\neven if flatly stated at first, remain amenable to judge-made\nexceptions. SeeMcKartv.United States, 395\nU.\u00a0S. 185, 193 (1969) (\u201cThe doctrine of exhaustion of\nadministrative remedies .\u00a0.\u00a0. is, like most judicial\ndoctrines, subject to numerous exceptions\u201d). But a statutory\nexhaustion provision stands on a different footing. There, Congress\nsets the rules\u2014and courts have a role in creating exceptions only\nif Congress wants them to. For that reason, mandatory exhaustion\nstatutes like the PLRA establish mandatory exhaustion regimes,\nforeclosing judicial discretion. See,e.g.,McNeilv.United States, 508 U.\u00a0S. 106, 111, 113 (1993) (\u201cWe are\nnot free to rewrite the statutory text\u201d when Congress has strictly\n\u201cbar[red] claimants from bringing suit in federal court until they\nhave exhausted their administrative remedies\u201d). Time and again,\nthis Court has taken such statutes at face value\u2014refusing to add\nunwritten limits onto their rigorous textual requirements. See,e.g.,id.,at 111;Shalalav.Illinois\nCouncil on Long Term Care,Inc., 529 U.\u00a0S. 1 \u201314\n(2000); see also 2 R. Pierce, Administrative Law Treatise \u00a715.3, p.\n1241 (5th ed. 2010) (collecting cases).We have taken just that approach in construing\nthe PLRA\u2019s exhaustion provision\u2014rejecting every attempt to deviate\n(as the Fourth Circuit did here) from its textual mandate. InBoothv.Churner, 532 U.\u00a0S. 731 (2001) , for\nexample, the prisoner argued that exhaustion was not necessary\nbecause he wanted a type of relief that the administrative process\ndid not provide. But \u00a71997e(a), we replied, made no distinctions\nbased on the particular \u201cforms of relief sought and offered,\u201d and\nthat legislative judgment must control: We would not read\n\u201cexceptions into statutory exhaustion requirements where Congress\nhas provided otherwise.\u201dId., at 741, n.\u00a06. The next\nyear, inPorterv.Nussle, 534 U.\u00a0S. 516, 520\n(2002) , the Court rejected a proposal to carve out excessive-force\nclaims (like Blake\u2019s) from the PLRA\u2019s exhaustion regime, viewing\nthat approach too as inconsistent with the uncompromising statutory\ntext. And most recently, inWoodford, we turned aside a\nrequested exception for constitutional claims. 548 U. S., at 91,\nn.\u00a02. Our explanation was familiar: \u201cWe are interpreting and\napplying\u201d not a judge-made doctrine but a \u201cstatutory requirement,\u201d\nand therefore must honor Congress\u2019s choice.Ibid.[1] All those precedents rebut the Court\nof Appeals\u2019 adoption of a \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d excuse for\nnon-exhaustion.So too, the history of the PLRA underscores the\nmandatory nature of its exhaustion regime. Section \u00a71997e(a)\u2019s\nprecursor, enacted in the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons\nAct (CRIPA), \u00a77, 94Stat. 352 (1980), was a \u201cweak exhaustion\nprovision.\u201dWoodford, 548 U. S., at 84. Under CRIPA, a court\nwould require exhaustion only if a State provided \u201cplain, speedy,\nand effective\u201d remedies meeting federal minimum standards\u2014and even\nthen, only if the court believed exhaustion \u201cappropriate and in the\ninterests of justice.\u201d \u00a77(a), 94Stat. 352. That statutory scheme\nmade exhaustion \u201cin large part discretionary.\u201dNussle, 534\nU.\u00a0S., at 523. And for that reason (among others), CRIPA\nproved inadequate to stem the then-rising tide of prisoner\nlitigation. In enacting the PLRA, Congress thus substituted an\n\u201cinvigorated\u201d exhaustion provision.Woodford, 548\nU.\u00a0S., at 84. \u201c[D]iffer[ing] markedly from its predecessor,\u201d\nthe new \u00a71997e(a) removed the conditions that administrative\nremedies be \u201cplain, speedy, and effective\u201d and that they satisfy\nminimum standards.Nussle, 534 U.\u00a0S., at 524. Still\nmore, the PLRA prevented a court from deciding that exhaustion\nwould be unjust or inappropriate in a given case. As described\nearlier, seesupra,at 4\u20135, all inmates must now exhaust all\navailable remedies: \u201cExhaustion is no longer left to the discretion\nof the district court.\u201dWoodford, 548 U.\u00a0S., at 85.The PLRA\u2019s history (just like its text) thus\nrefutes a \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d exception to its rule of\nexhaustion. That approach, if applied broadly, would resurrect\nCRIPA\u2019s scheme, in which a court could look to all the particulars\nof a case to decide whether to excuse a failure to exhaust\navailable remedies. But as we have observed, such wide-ranging\ndiscretion \u201cis now a thing of the past.\u201dBooth, 532\nU.\u00a0S., at 739. And the conflict with the PLRA\u2019s history (as\nagain with its text) becomes scarcely less stark if the Fourth\nCircuit\u2019s exception is confined, as the court may have intended, to\ncases in which a prisoner makes a reasonable mistake about the\nmeaning of a prison\u2019s grievance procedures. Understood that way,\nthe exception reintroduces CRIPA\u2019s requirement that the remedial\nprocess be \u201cplain\u201d\u2014that is, not subject to any reasonable\nmisunderstanding or disagreement. \u00a77(a), 94Stat. 352. When Congress\namends legislation, courts must \u201cpresume it intends [the change] to\nhave real and substantial effect.\u201dStonev.INS, 514\nU.\u00a0S. 386, 397 (1995) . The Court of Appeals instead acted as\nthough the amendment\u2014from a largely permissive to a mandatory\nexhaustion regime\u2014had not taken place.[2]BYet our rejection of the Fourth Circuit\u2019s\n\u201cspecial circumstances\u201d exception does not end this case\u2014because\nthe PLRA contains its own, textual exception to mandatory\nexhaustion. Under \u00a71997e(a), the exhaustion requirement hinges on\nthe \u201cavailab[ility]\u201d of administrative remedies: An inmate, that\nis, must exhaust available remedies, but need not exhaust\nunavailable ones. And that limitation on an inmate\u2019s duty to\nexhaust\u2014although significantly different from the \u201cspecial\ncircumstances\u201d test or the old CRIPA standard\u2014has real content. As\nwe explained inBooth, the ordinary meaning of the word\n\u201cavailable\u201d is \u201c\u00a0\u2018capable of use for the accomplishment of a\npurpose,\u2019 and that which \u2018is accessible or may be obtained.\u2019\u00a0\u201d\n532 U. S., at 737\u2013738 (quoting Webster\u2019s Third New International\nDictionary 150 (1993)); see also Random House Dictionary of the\nEnglish Language 142 (2d ed. 1987) (\u201csuitable or ready for use\u201d); 1\nOxford English Dictionary 812 (2d ed. 1989) (\u201ccapable of being made\nuse of, at one\u2019s disposal, within one\u2019s reach\u201d); Black\u2019s Law\nDictionary 135 (6th ed. 1990) (\u201cuseable\u201d; \u201cpresent or ready for\nimmediate use\u201d). Accordingly, an inmate is required to exhaust\nthose, but only those, grievance procedures that are \u201ccapable of\nuse\u201d to obtain \u201csome relief for the action complained of.\u201dBooth, 532 U.\u00a0S., at 738.To state that standard, of course, is just to\nbegin; courts in this and other cases must apply it to the\nreal-world workings of prison grievance systems. Building on our\nown and lower courts\u2019 decisions, we note as relevant here three\nkinds of circumstances in which an administrative remedy, although\nofficially on the books, is not capable of use to obtain relief.\nSee Tr. of Oral Arg. 27\u201329 (Solicitor General asamicus\ncuriaeacknowledging these three kinds of unavailability).\nGiven prisons\u2019 own incentives to maintain functioning remedial\nprocesses, we expect that these circumstances will not often arise.\nSeeWoodford, 548 U.\u00a0S., at 102. But when one (or more)\ndoes, an inmate\u2019s duty to exhaust \u201cavailable\u201d remedies does not\ncome into play.First, asBoothmade clear, an\nadministrative procedure is unavailable when (despite what\nregulations or guidance materials may promise) it operates as a\nsimple dead end\u2014with officers unable or consistently unwilling to\nprovide any relief to aggrieved inmates. See 532 U.\u00a0S., at\n736, 738. Suppose, for example, that a prison handbook directs\ninmates to submit their grievances to a particular administrative\noffice\u2014but in practice that office disclaims the capacity to\nconsider those petitions. The procedure is not then \u201ccapable of\nuse\u201d for the pertinent purpose. InBooth\u2019s words: \u201c[S]ome\nredress for a wrong is presupposed by the statute\u2019s requirement\u201d of\nan \u201cavailable\u201d remedy; \u201cwhere the relevant administrative procedure\nlacks authority to provide any relief,\u201d the inmate has \u201cnothing to\nexhaust.\u201dId.,at 736, and n.\u00a04. So too if\nadministrative officials have apparent authority, but decline ever\nto exercise it. Once again: \u201c[T]he modifier \u2018available\u2019 requires\nthe possibility of some relief.\u201dId.,at 738. When the facts\non the ground demonstrate that no such potential exists, the inmate\nhas no obligation to exhaust the remedy.Next, an administrative scheme might be so\nopaque that it becomes, practically speaking, incapable of use. In\nthis situation, some mechanism exists to provide relief, but no\nordinary prisoner can discern or navigate it. As the Solicitor\nGeneral put the point: When rules are \u201cso confusing that\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. no reasonable prisoner can use them,\u201d then \u201cthey\u2019re\nno longer available.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 23. That is a significantly\nhigher bar than CRIPA established or the Fourth Circuit suggested:\nThe procedures need not be sufficiently \u201cplain\u201d as to preclude any\nreasonable mistake or debate with respect to their meaning. See\n\u00a77(a), 94Stat. 352; 787 F.\u00a03d, at 698\u2013699;supra,at 3,\n6\u20138. When an administrative process is susceptible of multiple\nreasonable interpretations, Congress has determined that the inmate\nshould err on the side of exhaustion. But when a remedy is, in\nJudge Carnes\u2019s phrasing, essentially \u201cunknowable\u201d\u2014so that no\nordinary prisoner can make sense of what it demands\u2014then it is also\nunavailable. SeeGoebertv.Lee County, 510 F. 3d\n1312, 1323 (CA11 2007);Turnerv.Burnside, 541\nF.\u00a03d 1077, 1084 (CA11 2008) (\u201cRemedies that rational inmates\ncannot be expected to use are not capable of accomplishing their\npurposes andso are not available\u201d). Accordingly, exhaustion is not\nrequired.And finally, the same is true when prison\nadministrators thwart inmates from taking advantage of a grievance\nprocess through machination, misrepresentation, or intimidation. InWoodford, we recognized that officials might devise\nprocedural systems (including the blind alleys and quagmires just\ndiscussed) in order to \u201ctrip[] up all but the most skillful\nprisoners.\u201d 548 U.\u00a0S., at 102. And appellate courts have\naddressed a variety of instances in which officials misled or\nthreatened individual inmates so as to prevent their use of\notherwise proper procedures. As all those courts have recognized,\nsuch interference with an inmate\u2019s pursuit of relief renders the\nadministrative process unavailable.[3] And then, once again, \u00a71997e(a) poses no bar.The facts of this case raise questions about\nwhether, given these principles, Blake had an \u201cavailable\u201d\nadministrative remedy to exhaust. As explained earlier, Ross\u2019s\nexhaustion defense rests on Blake\u2019s failure to seek relief through\nMaryland\u2019s ARP process, which begins with a grievance to the warden\nand may continue with appeals to the Commissioner of Correction and\nthe IGO. Seesupra, at 2\u20133; Inmate Handbook, at 30\u201331. That\nprocess is the standard method for addressing inmate complaints in\nthe State\u2019s prisons: The Inmate Handbook provides that prisoners\nmay use the ARP for \u201call types\u201d of grievances (subject to four\nexceptions not relevant here), including those relating to the use\nof force.Id.,at 30; see App. 312. But recall that Maryland\nseparately maintains the IIU to look into charges of staff\nmisconduct in prisons, and the IIU did just that here. Seesupra,at 2. Blake urged in the courts below that once the\nIIU commences such an inquiry, a prisonercannotobtain\nrelief through the standard ARP process\u2014whatever the Handbook may\nsay to the contrary. See 787 F.\u00a03d, at 697; App. to Pet. for\nCert. 38, 2012 WL 5568940, at *5. And in this Court, that issue has\ntaken on new life. Both Blake and Ross (as represented by the\nMaryland attorney general) have lodged additional materials\nrelating to the interaction between the IIU and the ARP. Andbothsides\u2019 submissions, although scattershot and in need of\nfurther review, lend some support to Blake\u2019s account\u2014while also\nrevealing Maryland\u2019s grievance process to have, at least at first\nblush, some bewildering features.Blake\u2019s filings include many administrative\ndispositions (gleaned from the records of other prisoner suits)\nindicating that Maryland wardens routinely dismiss ARP grievances\nas procedurally improper when parallel IIU investigations are\npending. One warden, for example, wrote in response to a prisoner\u2019s\ncomplaint: \u201cYour Request for Administrative Remedy has been\nreceived and is hereby dismissed. This issue has been assigned to\nthe Division of Correction\u2019s Internal Investigative Unit (Case\n#07\u201335\u2013010621I/C), and will no longer be addressed through this\nprocess.\u201d Lodging of Respondent 1; see also,e.g., id., at\n18 (\u201cAdmin. Dismiss Final: This is being investigated outside of\nthe ARP process by I.I.U.\u201d). In addition, Blake has submitted\nbriefs of the Maryland attorney general (again, drawn from former\nprisoner suits) specifically recognizing that administrative\npractice. As the attorney general stated in one case: \u201cWilkerson\nfiled an ARP request,\u201d but \u201chis complaint already was being\ninvestigated by the [IIU], superceding an ARP investigation.\u201dId., at 23\u201324; see also,e.g., id.,at 5 (Bacon\u2019s\ngrievance \u201cwas dismissed because the issue had been assigned to\n[the] IIU and would no longer be addressed through the ARP\nprocess\u201d).[4]And Ross\u2019s own submissions offer some\nconfirmation of Blake\u2019s view. Ross does not identify a single case\nin which a warden considered the merits of an ARP grievance while\nan IIU inquiry was underway. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 6 (Maryland\nattorney general\u2019s office conceding that it had found none). To the\ncontrary, his lodging contains still further evidence that wardens\nconsistently dismiss such complaints as misdirected. See,e.g.,Lodging of Petitioner 15 (District Court noting that\n\u201cGladhill was advised that no further action would be taken through\nthe ARP process because the matter had been referred to the\n[IIU]\u201d). Indeed, Ross\u2019 materials suggest that some wardens use a\nrubber stamp specially devised for that purpose; the inmate, that\nis, receives a reply stamped with the legend: \u201cDismissed for\nprocedural reasons .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. This issue is being\ninvestigated by IIU case number: ____. No further action shall be\ntaken within the ARP process.\u201dId.,at 25, 32, 38; see Tr.\nof Oral Arg. 8\u20139 (Maryland attorney general\u2019s office conceding the\nstamp\u2019s existence and use).Complicating the picture, however, are several\ncases in which an inmate refused to take a warden\u2019s jurisdictional\n\u201cno\u201d for an answer, resubmitted his grievance up the chain to the\nIGO, and there received a ruling on the merits, without any\ndiscussion of the ARP/IIU issue. We confess to finding these few\ncases perplexing in relation to normal appellate procedure. Seeid., at 3\u201310, 13\u201315, 18\u201320 (multiple Justices expressing\nconfusion about Maryland\u2019s procedures). If the IGO thinks the\nwardens wrong to dismiss complaints because of pending IIU\ninvestigations, why does it not say so and stop the practice?\nConversely, if the IGO thinks the wardens right, how can it then\nissue merits decisions? And if that really is Maryland\u2019s\nprocedure\u2014that when an IIU investigation is underway, the warden\n(and Commissioner of Correction) cannot consider a prisoner\u2019s\ncomplaint, but the IGO can\u2014why does the Inmate Handbook not spell\nthis out? Are there, instead, other materials provided to prisoners\nthat communicate how this seemingly unusual process works and how\nto navigate it so as to get a claim heard?In light of all these lodgings and the questions\nthey raise about Maryland\u2019s grievance process, we remand this case\nfor further consideration of whether Blake had \u201cavailable\u201d remedies\nto exhaust. The materials we have seen are not conclusive; they may\nnot represent the complete universe of relevant documents, and few\nhave been analyzed in the courts below. On remand, in addition to\nconsidering any other arguments still alive in this case, the court\nmust perform a thorough review of such materials, and then address\nthe legal issues we have highlighted concerning the availability of\nadministrative remedies. First, did Maryland\u2019s standard grievance\nprocedures potentially offer relief to Blake or, alternatively, did\nthe IIU investigation into his assault foreclose that possibility?\nSecond, even if the former, were those procedures knowable by an\nordinary prisoner in Blake\u2019s situation, or was the system so\nconfusing that no such inmate could make use of it? And finally, is\nthere persuasive evidence that Maryland officials thwarted the\neffective invocation of the administrative process through threats,\ngame-playing, or misrepresentations, either on a system-wide basis\nor in the individual case? If the court accepts Blake\u2019s probable\narguments on one or more of these scores, then itshould find\n(consistent this time with the PLRA) that his suit may proceed even\nthough he did not file an ARP complaint.IIICourts may not engraft an unwritten \u201cspecial\ncircumstances\u201d exception onto the PLRA\u2019s exhaustion requirement.\nThe only limit to \u00a71997e(a)\u2019s mandate is the one baked into its\ntext: An inmate need exhaust only such administrative remedies as\nare \u201cavailable.\u201d On remand, the court below must consider how that\nmodifying term affects Blake\u2019s case\u2014that is, whether the remedies\nhe failed to exhaust were \u201cavailable\u201d under the principles set out\nhere. We therefore vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and\nremand the case for further proceedings consistent with this\nopinion.It is so ordered.Notes1We note that our\nadherence to the PLRA\u2019s text runs both ways: The same principle\napplies regardless of whether it benefits the inmate or the prison.\nWe have thus overturned judicial rulings that imposed\nextra-statutory limitations on a prisoner\u2019s capacity to\nsue\u2014reversing, for example, decisions that required an inmate to\ndemonstrate exhaustion in his complaint, permitted suit against\nonly defendants named in the administrative grievance, and\ndismissed an entire action because of a single unexhausted claim.\nSeeJonesv.Bock, 549 U.\u00a0S. 199, 203 (2007) .\n\u201c[T]hese rules,\u201d we explained, \u201care not required by the PLRA,\u201d and\n\u201ccrafting and imposing them exceeds the proper limits on the\njudicial role.\u201dIbid.2Of course, an exhaustion\nprovision with a different text and history from \u00a71997e(a) might be\nbest read to give judges the leeway to create exceptions or to\nitself incorporate standard administrative-law exceptions. See 2 R.\nPierce, Administrative Law Treatise \u00a715.3, p. 1245 (5th ed. 2010).\nThe question in all cases is one of statutory construction, which\nmust be resolved using ordinary interpretive\ntechniques.3See,e.g.,Davisv.Hernandez, 798 F. 3d 290, 295 (CA5 2015)\n(\u201cGrievance procedures are unavailable .\u00a0.\u00a0. if the\ncorrectional facility\u2019s staff misled the inmate as to the existence\nor rules of the grievance process so as to cause the inmate to fail\nto exhaust such process\u201d (emphasis deleted));Schultzv.Pugh, 728 F. 3d 619, 620 (CA7 2013) (\u201cA remedy is not\navailable, therefore, to a prisoner prevented by threats or other\nintimidation by prison personnel from seeking an administrative\nremedy\u201d);Paveyv.Conley, 663 F. 3d 899, 906 (CA7\n2011) (\u201c[I]f prison officials misled [a prisoner] into thinking\nthat .\u00a0.\u00a0. he had done all he needed to initiate the\ngrievance process,\u201d then \u201c[a]n administrative remedy is not\n\u2018available\u2019\u00a0\u201d);Tuckelv.Grover, 660 F. 3d\n1249, 1252\u20131253 (CA10 2011) (\u201c[W]hen a prison official inhibits an\ninmate from utilizing an administrative process through threats or\nintimidation, that process can no longer be said to be\n\u2018available\u2019\u00a0\u201d);Goebertv.Lee County,\n510 F. 3d 1312, 1323 (CA11 2007) (If a prison \u201cplay[s]\nhide-and-seek with administrative remedies,\u201d then they are not\n\u201cavailable\u201d).4Blake further notes that\nin 2008, a year after his beating, Maryland amended one of its\nprison directives to state expressly that when the IIU investigates\nan incident, an ARP grievance may not proceed. See App. 367, Md.\nDiv. of Correction, Directive 185\u2013003, \u00a7VI(N)(4) (Aug. 27, 2008)\n(The Warden \u201cshall issue a final dismissal of [an ARP] request for\nprocedural reasons when it has been determined that the basis of\nthe complaint is the same basis of an investigation under the\nauthority of the [IIU]\u201d); Brief for Respondent 17\u201318. According to\nBlake, that amendment merely codified what his submissions show had\nlong been the practice in Maryland prisons. Seeibid.",
