Justice Scalia\u2019s opinion for the Court\ndemonstrates why EPA\u2019s interpretation deserves no deference under\nour precedents. I write separately to note that its request for\ndeference raises serious questions about the constitutionality of\nour broader practice of deferring to agency interpretations of\nfederal statutes. SeeChevron U.\u00a0S.\u00a0A. Inc.v.Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.\u00a0S. 837\n(1984) .Chevrondeference is premised on \u201ca\npresumption that Congress, when it left ambiguity in a statute\nmeant for implementation by an agency, understood that the\nambiguity would be resolved, first and foremost, by the agency, and\ndesired the agency (rather than the courts) to possess whatever\ndegree of discretion the ambiguity allows.\u201dSmileyv.Citibank (South Dakota), N.\u00a0A., 517 U.\u00a0S. 735 \u2013741\n(1996). We most often describe Congress\u2019 supposed choice to leave\nmatters to agency discretion as an allocation of interpretive\nauthority. See,e.g.,National Cable &\nTelecommunications Assn.v.Brand X Internet Services,\n545 U.\u00a0S. 967, 983 (2005) (referring to the agency as \u201cthe\nauthoritative interpreter (within the limits of reason) of\n[ambiguous] statutes\u201d). But we sometimes treat that discretion as\nthough it were a form of legislative power. See,e.g., United\nStatesv.Mead Corp., 533 U.\u00a0S. 218, 229 (2001)\n(noting that the agency \u201cspeak[s] with the force of law when it\naddresses ambiguity in the statute or fills a space in the enacted\nlaw\u201d even when \u201c\u00a0\u2018Congress did not actually have an intent\u2019 as\nto a particular result\u201d). Either way,Chevrondeference\nraises serious separation-of-powers questions.As I have explained elsewhere, \u201c[T]he judicial\npower, as originally understood, requires a court to exercise its\nindependent judgment in interpreting and expounding upon the laws.\u201dPerezv.Mortgage Bankers Assn., 575 U.\u00a0S. ___,\n___ (2015) (opinion concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 8).\nInterpreting federal statutes\u2014including ambiguous ones administered\nby an agency\u2014\u201ccalls for that exercise of independent judgment.\u201dId.,at ___ (slip op., at 12).Chevrondeference\nprecludes judges from exercising that judgment, forcing them to\nabandon what they believe is \u201cthe best reading of an ambiguous\nstatute\u201d in favor of an agency\u2019s construction.Brand X,supra,at 983. It thus wrests from Courts the ultimate\ninterpretative authority to \u201csay what the law is,\u201dMarburyv.Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 177 (1803), and hands it over to\nthe Executive. SeeBrand X,supra,at 983 (noting\nthat the judicial construction of an ambiguous statute is \u201cnot\nauthoritative\u201d). Such a transfer is in tension with Article III\u2019s\nVesting Clause, which vests the judicial power exclusively in\nArticle III courts, not administrative agencies. U.\u00a0S. Const.,\nArt.\u00a0III, \u00a71.In reality, as the Court illustrates in the\ncourse of dismantling EPA\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7112(n)(1)(A),\nagencies \u201cinterpreting\u201d ambiguous statutes typically are not\nengaged in acts of interpretation at all. See,e.g.,ante,at 9. Instead, asChevronitself acknowledged,\nthey are engaged in the \u201c\u00a0\u2018formulation of policy.\u2019\u00a0\u201d 467\nU.\u00a0S., at 843. Statu-tory ambiguity thus becomes an implicit\ndelegation of rule-making authority, and that authority is used not\nto find the best meaning of the text, but to formulate legally\nbinding rules to fill in gaps based on policy judgments made by the\nagency rather than Congress.Although acknowledging this fact might allow us\nto escape the jaws of Article III\u2019s Vesting Clause, it runs\nheadlong into the teeth of Article I\u2019s, which vests \u201c[a]ll\nlegislative Powers herein granted\u201d in Congress. U.\u00a0S. Const.,\nArt I., \u00a71. For if we give the \u201cforce of law\u201d to agency\npronouncements on matters of private conduct as towhich\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018Congress did not actually have an intent,\u2019\u00a0\u201dMead,supra,at 229, we permit a body other than\nCongress to perform a function that requires an exercise of the\nlegislative power. SeeDepartment of Transportationv.Association of American Railroads, 575 U.\u00a0S. ___,\n___\u2013___ (2015) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment) (slip op., at\n21\u201322).These cases bring into bold relief the scope of\nthe potentially unconstitutional delegations we have come to\ncountenance in the name ofChevrondeference. What EPA\nclaims for itself here is not the power to make political judgments\nin implementing Congress\u2019 policies, nor even the power to make\ntradeoffs between competing policy goals set by Congress,American Railroads,supra, at ___\u2013___ (opinion of\nThomas, J.) (slip op., at 20\u201321) (collecting cases involving\nstatutes that delegated this legislative authority). It is the\npower to decide\u2014without any particular fidelity to the text\u2014which\npolicy goals EPA wishes to pursue. Should EPA wield its vast powers\nover electric utilities to protect public health? A pristine\nenvironment? Economic security? We are told that the breadth of the\nword \u201cappropriate\u201d authorizes EPA to decide for itself how to\nanswer that question. Compare 77 Fed. Reg. 9327 (2012) (\u201c[N]othing\nabout the definition [of \u201cappropriate\u201d]compelsa\nconsideration of costs\u201d (emphasis added)) with Tr. of Oral Arg. 42\n(\u201c[T]he phrase appropriate and necessary doesn\u2019t, by its terms,precludethe EPA from considering cost\u201d (emphasis\nadded)).[1]Perhaps there is some unique historical\njustification for deferring to federal agencies, seeMead,supra,at 243 (Scalia, J., dissenting), but these cases\nreveal how paltry an effort we have made to understand it or to\nconfine ourselves to its boundaries. Although we hold today that\nEPA exceeded even the extremely permissive limits on agency power\nset by our precedents, we should be alarmed that it felt\nsufficiently emboldened by those precedents to make the bid for\ndeference that it did here.[2]\nAs in other areas of our jurisprudence concerning administrative\nagencies, see,e.g., B&B Hardware, Inc.v.Hargis\nIndustries, Inc., 575 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___\u2013___ (2015) (Thomas,\nJ., dissenting) (slip op., at 10\u201314), we seem to be straying\nfurther and further from the Constitution without so much as\npausing to ask why. We should stop to consider that document before\nblithely giving the force of law to any other agency\n\u201cinterpretations\u201d of federal statutes.Notes1I can think of no name\nfor such power other than \u201clegislative power.\u201d Had we deferred to\nEPA\u2019s interpretation in these cases, then, we might have violated\nanother constitutional command by abdicating our check on the\npolitical branches\u2014namely, our duty to enforce the rule of law\nthrough an exercise of the judicial power.Perezv.Mortgage Bankers Assn., 575 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___\u2013___ (2015)\n(Thomas, J., concurring in judgment) (slip op., at\n14\u201316).2This is not the first\ntime an agency has exploited our practice of deferring to agency\ninterpretations of statutes. See,e.g., Texas Dept. of Housing\nand Community Affairsv.Inclusive Communities Project,\nInc., ante,at 6\u20137 (Thomas, J., dissenting).",
