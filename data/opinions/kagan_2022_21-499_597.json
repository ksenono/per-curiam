Those protections derive\nfrom the Constitution:Dickersonv.United Statestells us in no uncertain terms thatMirandais a\n\u201cconstitutional rule.\u201d530 U.S.\n428, 444 (2000). And that rule grants a corresponding right: If\npolice fail to provide theMirandawarnings to a suspect\nbefore interrogating him, then he is generally entitled to have any\nresulting confession excluded from his trial. See 384 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 478\u2013479. From those facts, only one conclusion can follow\u2014thatMiranda\u2019s protections are a \u201cright[\u00a0]\u201d \u201csecured by the\nConstitution\u201d under the federal civil rights statute. Rev. Stat.\n\u00a71979, 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71983. Yet the Court today says\notherwise. It holds thatMirandais not a constitutional\nright enforceable through a \u00a71983 suit. And so it prevents\nindividuals from obtaining any redress when police violate their\nrights underMiranda. I respectfully dissent.Mirandaresponded to problems stemming\nfrom the interrogation of suspects \u201cincommunicado\u201d and \u201cin a\npolice-dominated atmosphere.\u201dMiranda, 384 U.\u00a0S., at\n445. In such an environment,Mirandasaid, there are\n\u201cpressures\u201d which may \u201ccompel [a suspect] to speak where he would\nnot otherwise do so freely.\u201dId., at 467. And soMirandafound a \u201cnecessity for procedures which assure that\nthe individual is accorded his\u201d Fifth Amendment privilege \u201cnot to\nbe compelled to incriminate himself.\u201dId., at 439.Mirandaset out protocols (including the now-familiar\nwarnings) that would safeguard the constitutional privilege against\nself-incrimination. Seeid., at 478\u2013479. AndMirandaheld that if police failed to follow those requirements (without\nsubstituting equally effective ones), the prosecution could not use\nat trial a statement obtained from the interrogation. Seeid., at 479.The question in this case is whetherMiranda\u2019s protections are a \u201cright[\u00a0]\u201d that is \u201csecured\nby the Constitution\u201d within the meaning of \u00a71983. If the answer is\nyes, then a person may sue a state actor who deprives him of the\nright. In past cases, the Court has given a broad construction to\n\u00a71983\u2019s broad language. See,e.g.,Dennisv.Higgins,498 U.S.\n439, 443 (1991). Under \u00a71983 (as elsewhere), a \u201cright[\u00a0]\u201d\nis anything that creates specific \u201cobligations binding on [a]\ngovernmental unit\u201d that an individual may ask the judiciary to\nenforce.Id., at 449; seeid., at 447, and n.\u00a07.\nAnd the phrase \u201csecured by the Constitution\u201d also has a capacious\nmeaning. It refers to any right that is \u201cprotect[ed] or ma[de]\ncertain\u201d by the country\u2019s foundational charter.Haguev.Committee for Industrial Organization,307 U.S.\n496, 527 (1939) (opinion of Stone, J.) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).Begin with whetherMirandais \u201csecured by\nthe Constitution.\u201d We know that it is, because the Court\u2019s decision\ninDickersonsays so.Dickersontells us again and\nagain thatMirandais a \u201cconstitutional rule.\u201d 530\nU.\u00a0S., at 444. It is a \u201cconstitutional decision\u201d that sets\nforth \u201c\u00a0\u2018concrete constitutional guidelines.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId., at 432, 435 (quotingMiranda, 384 U.\u00a0S., at\n442).Miranda\u201cis constitutionally based\u201d; or again, it has\na \u201cconstitutional basis.\u201d 530 U.\u00a0S., at 439, n.\u00a03, 440.\nIt is \u201cof constitutional origin\u201d; it has \u201cconstitutional\nunderpinnings.\u201dId., at 439, n.\u00a03, 440, n.\u00a05.\nAnd\u2014one more\u2014Mirandasets a \u201cconstitutional minimum.\u201d 530\nU.\u00a0S., at 442. Over and over,DickersonlabelsMirandaa rule stemming from the Constitution.Dickersonalso makes plain thatMirandahas all the substance of a constitutional\nrule\u2014including that it cannot be \u201cabrogate[d]\u201d by any\n\u201clegislation.\u201dMiranda, 384 U.\u00a0S., at 491; seeDickerson, 530 U.\u00a0S., at 437. InDickerson, the\nCourt considered a federal statute whose obvious purpose was to\noverrideMiranda.Dickersonheld thatMirandais a \u201cconstitutional decision\u201d that cannot be \u201coverruled by\u201d any\n\u201cAct of Congress.\u201d 530 U.\u00a0S., at 432. To be sure, Congress may\ndevise \u201clegislative solutions that differ[\u00a0] from the\nprescribedMirandawarnings,\u201d but only if those solutions\nare \u201c\u00a0\u2018at least as effective.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId., at 440\n(quotingMiranda, 384 U.\u00a0S., at 467).Dickersontherefore instructs (as noted above) thatMirandasets a\n\u201cconstitutional minimum.\u201d 530 U.\u00a0S., at 442. No statute may\nprovide lesser protection than that baseline.[1]*AndDickersonmakes clear that the\nconstitutional substance ofMirandadoes not end there.\nRules arising from \u201cthe United States Constitution\u201d are applicable\nin state-court proceedings, but non-constitutional rules are not.\nSee 530 U.\u00a0S., at 438 (explaining that the Court \u201cdo[es] not\nhold a supervisory power over the courts of the several States\u201d).\nToo, constitutional rules are enforceable in federal-court habeas\nproceedings, where a prisoner is entitled to claim he \u201cis in\ncustody in violation of the Constitution.\u201d 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a72254(a).Mirandachecks both boxes. The Court has\n\u201cconsistently appliedMiranda\u2019s rule to prosecutions arising\nin state courts.\u201dDickerson, 530 U.\u00a0S., at 438. And\nprisoners may claimMirandaviolations in federal-court\nhabeas proceedings. See 530 U.\u00a0S., at 439, n.\u00a03;Thompsonv.Keohane,516 U.S.\n99, 107, n.\u00a05 (1995). SoDickersonis unequivocal:Mirandais set in constitutional stone.Miranda\u2019s constitutional rule gives\nsuspects a correlative \u201cright[\u00a0].\u201d \u00a71983. UnderMiranda, a suspect typically has a right to be tried without\nthe prosecutor using his un-Mirandizedstatement. And we\nknow how that right operates in the real world. Suppose a defendant\nstanding trial was able to show the court that he gave an\nun-Mirandizedconfession during a custodial interrogation.\nThe court would have no choice but to exclude it from the\nprosecutor\u2019s case. As one judge below put it: \u201cMirandaindisputably creates individual legal rights that are judicially\nenforceable. (Any prosecutor who doubts this can try to introduce\nan un-Mirandizedconfession and then watch what happens.)\u201dTekohv.County of Los Angeles, 997 F.3d 1260, 1263\n(CA9 2021) (Miller, J., concurring in denial of rehearing en\nbanc).The majority basically agrees with everything\nI\u2019ve just explained. It concurs that, perDickerson,Miranda\u201cadopted a \u2018constitutional rule.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAnte, at 11 (quotingDickerson, 530 U.\u00a0S., at\n439); seeante, at 12. How could it not? ThatMirandais a constitutional rule is whatDickersonsaid (and said\nand said). The majority also agrees thatMiranda\u201cdirected\nthat statements obtained in violation of [its] rules may not be\nused by the prosecution in its case-in-chief\u00a0\u201d\u2014which is simply\nanother way of saying thatMirandagrants suspects a right\nto the exclusion of those statements from the prosecutor\u2019s case.Ante, at 5.So how does the majority hold that a violation\nofMirandais not a \u201cdeprivation of [a] right[\u00a0]\u201d\n\u201csecured by the Constitution\u201d? \u00a71983. How does it agree with my\npremises, but not my conclusion? The majority\u2019s argument is that \u201ca\nviolation ofMirandadoes not necessarily constitute a\nviolation of the Constitution,\u201d becauseMiranda\u2019s rules are\n\u201cprophylactic.\u201dAnte, at 13. The idea is that the Fifth\nAmendment prohibits the use only of statements obtained by\ncompulsion, whereasMirandaexcludes non-compelled\nstatements too. Seeante, at 4\u20135. That is why, the majority\nsays, the Court has been able to recognize exceptions permitting\ncertain uses of un-Mirandizedstatements at trial (when it\ncould not do so for compelled statements). Seeante, at\n7\u20139.But none of that helps the majority\u2019s case.\nLet\u2019s assume, as the majority says, thatMirandaextends\nbeyond\u2014in order to safeguard\u2014the Fifth Amendment\u2019s core guarantee.\nStill,Mirandais enforceable through \u00a71983. It remains a\nconstitutional rule, asDickersonheld (and the majority\nagrees). And it grants the defendant a legally enforceable\nentitlement\u2014in a word, a right\u2014to have his confession excluded. So,\nto refer back to the language of \u00a71983,Mirandagrants a\n\u201cright[\u00a0]\u201d \u201csecured by the Constitution.\u201d Whether that right\nto have evidence excluded safeguards a yet deeper constitutional\ncommitment makes no difference to \u00a71983. The majority has no\nresponse to that point\u2014except to repeat what our argument assumes\nalready. Seeante, at 14, n. 6 (describingMirandaas\nprophylactic).Compare the majority\u2019s holding today to a prior\ndecision, in which the Court \u201crejected [an] attempt[\u00a0] to\nlimit the types of constitutional rights that are encompassed\nwithin\u00a0\u201d \u00a71983.Dennis, 498 U.\u00a0S., at 445. There,\nthe Court held that a plaintiff could sue under \u00a71983 for a\nviolation of the so-called dormant Commerce Clause, which\nsafeguards interstate commerce. To the Court, it did not matter\nthat the Commerce Clause might be viewed as \u201cmerely allocat[ing]\npower between the Federal and State Governments\u201d over interstate\ncommerce, rather than as \u201cconfer[ring] \u2018rights.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId.,\nat 447. Nor did it matter that the dormant Commerce Clause\u2019s\nprotection is only \u201cimplied\u201d by the constitutional text.Ibid., n.\u00a07. The dormant Commerce Clause, the Court\nsaid, still provides a \u201cright\u201d\u2014in the \u201cordinary\u201d sense of being\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018[a] legally enforceable claim of one person against\nanother.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIbid.(quoting Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1324\n(6th ed. 1990)). That describesMirandato a tee. And if a\nright implied from Congress\u2019s constitutional authority over\ninterstate commerce is enforceable under \u00a71983, how could it be\nthatMiranda\u2014which the Court has found necessary to\nsafeguard the personal protections of the Fifth Amendment\u2014is not\nalso enforceable? The majority again has no answer.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*Today, the Court strips individuals of the\nability to seek a remedy for violations of the right recognized inMiranda. The majority observes that defendants may still\nseek \u201cthe suppression at trial of statements obtained\u201d in violation\nofMiranda\u2019s procedures.Ante, at 14\u201315. But\nsometimes, such a statement will not be suppressed. And sometimes,\nas a result, a defendant will be wrongly convicted and spend years\nin prison. He may succeed, on appeal or in habeas, in getting the\nconviction reversed. But then, what remedy does he have for all the\nharm he has suffered? The point of \u00a71983 is to provide such\nredress\u2014because a remedy \u201cis a vital component of any scheme for\nvindicating cherished constitutional guarantees.\u201dGomezv.Toledo,446 U.S.\n635, 639 (1980). The majority here, as elsewhere, injures the\nright by denying the remedy. See,e.g.,Egbertv.Boule, 596 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2022). I respectfully\ndissent.Notes1*Other constitutional rules,\nlikeMiranda, leave room for States to experiment with\nprocedures, so long as the procedures satisfy the constitutionally\nmandated baseline. SeeCounty of Riversidev.McLaughlin,500 U.S.\n44, 58 (1991) (States may adopt different procedures for\nproviding probable-cause determinations for persons arrested\nwithout a warrant, so long as those determinations are made\npromptly);Smithv.Robbins,528\nU.S. 259, 276\u2013277 (2000) (States may adopt different procedures\nto ensure effective appellate review for indigent defendants\u2019\nclaims, \u201cso long as [the State] reasonably ensures that an\nindigent\u2019s appeal will be resolved in a way that is related to the\nmerit of that appeal\u201d).",
