S. ____ (2007)SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESNO. 05-9264ALPHONSO JAMES, Jr., PETITIONERv.UNITED\nSTATESon writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the eleventh circuit[April 18, 2007]Justice Thomas, dissenting.For the reasons set forth in my\nopinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment inShepardv.United States,544 U. S. 13, 27 (2005),\nI believe that \u201c[t]he constitutional infirmity of \u00a7924(e)(1) as\napplied to [James] makes today\u2019s decision an unnecessary exercise.\u201dApprendiv.New Jersey,530 U. S. 466(2000),\nand its progeny prohibit judges from \u201cmak[ing] a finding that\nraises [a defendant\u2019s] sentence beyond the sentence that could have\nlawfully been imposed by reference to facts found by the jury or\nadmitted by the defendant.\u201dUnited Statesv.Booker,543\nU. S. 220, 317\u2013318 (2005) (Thomas, J.,\ndissenting in part). Yet that is precisely what the Armed Career\nCriminal Act, 18 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7924(e) (2000 ed. and Supp. IV),\npermits in this case.Petitioner Alphonso James\npleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm, in\nviolation of \u00a7922(g)(1) (2000 ed.), which exposed him to a maximum\nsentence of 10 years under \u00a7924(a)(2). Section 924(e)(1) (2000 ed.,\nSupp. IV), however, mandated a minimum 15-year sentence if James\nhad three prior convictions for \u201ca violent felony or a serious drug\noffense.\u201d James admitted he had been convicted of three prior\nfelonies, but he argued that one of those felonies\u2014his conviction\nfor attempted burglary of a dwelling, in violation of Fla. Stat.\n\u00a7\u00a7810.02 and 777.04 (2006)\u2014was not a \u201cviolent felony\u201d for purposes\nof 18 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7924(e)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. IV). The District\nCourt resolved this disputed fact in favor of the Government and\nincreased James\u2019 sentence accordingly. Relying on the scheme we\ninitially created inTaylorv.United States,495 U. S. 575(1990), the Court of Appeals affirmed.Section 924(e)(1), in\nconjunction withTaylor,Shepard, and now today\u2019s\ndecision, \u201cexplain[s] to lower courts how to conduct factfinding\nthat is, according to the logic of this Court\u2019s intervening\nprecedents, unconstitutional in this very case.\u201dShepard,supra,at 27. For that reason, I respectfully\ndissent.",
