Since well before 1787, liberty has been\nunderstood as freedom from government action, not entitlement to\ngovernment benefits. The Framers created our Constitution to\npreserve that understanding of liberty. Yet the majority invokes\nour Constitution in the name of a \u201cliberty\u201d that the Framers would\nnot have recognized, to the detriment of the liberty they sought to\nprotect. Along the way, it rejects the idea\u2014captured in our\nDeclaration of Independence\u2014that human dignity is innate and\nsuggests instead that it comes from the Government. This distortion\nof our Constitution not only ignores the text, it inverts the\nrelationship between the individual and the state in our Republic.\nI cannot agree with it.IThe majority\u2019s decision today will require\nStates to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples and to\nrecognize same-sex marriages entered in other States largely based\non a constitutional provision guaranteeing \u201cdue process\u201d before a\nperson is deprived of his \u201clife, liberty, or prop-erty.\u201d I have\nelsewhere explained the dangerous fiction of treating the Due\nProcess Clause as a font of substantive rights.McDonaldv.Chicago, 561 U.\u00a0S. 742 \u2013812 (2010) (Thomas, J.,\nconcurring in part and concurring in judgment).It distorts\nthe constitutional text, which guarantees only whatever \u201cprocess\u201d\nis \u201cdue\u201d before a person is deprived of life, liberty, and\nproperty. U.\u00a0S. Const., Amdt. 14, \u00a71. Worse, it invites judges\nto do exactly what the majority has done here\u2014\u201c\u00a0\u2018roa[m] at\nlarge in the constitutional field\u2019 guided only by their personal\nviews\u201d as to the \u201c\u00a0\u2018fundamental rights\u2019\u00a0\u201d protected by\nthat document.Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa.v.Casey, 505 U.\u00a0S. 833, 953, 965 (1992) (Rehnquist, C.\nJ., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part) (quotingGriswoldv.Connecticut, 381 U.\u00a0S. 479, 502\n(1965) (Harlan, J., concurring in judgment)).By straying from the text of the Constitution,\nsubstantive due process exalts judges at the expense of the People\nfrom whom they derive their authority. Petitioners argue that by\nenshrining the traditional definition of marriage in their State\nConstitutions through voter-approved amendments, the States have\nput the issue \u201cbeyond the reach of the normal democratic process.\u201d\nBrief for Petitioners in No. 14\u2013562, p. 54. But the result\npetitioners seek is far less democratic. They ask nine judges on\nthis Court to enshrine their definition of marriage in the Federal\nConstitution and thus put it beyond the reach of the normal\ndemocratic process for the entire Nation. That a \u201cbare majority\u201d of\nthis Court,ante,at 25, is able to grant this wish, wiping\nout with a stroke of the keyboard the results of the political\nprocess in over 30 States, based on a provision that guarantees\nonly \u201cdue process\u201d is but further evidence of the danger of\nsubstantive due process.[1]IIEven if the doctrine of substantive due\nprocess were somehow defensible\u2014it is not\u2014petitioners still would\nnot have a claim. To invoke the protection of the Due Process\nClause at all\u2014whether under a theory of \u201csubstantive\u201d or\n\u201cprocedural\u201d due process\u2014a party must first identify a deprivation\nof \u201clife, liberty, or property.\u201d The majority claims these state\nlaws deprive petitioners of \u201cliberty,\u201d but the concept of \u201cliberty\u201d\nit conjures up bears no resemblance to any plausible meaning of\nthat word as it is used in the Due Process Clauses.A1As used in the Due Process Clauses, \u201cliberty\u201d\nmost likely refers to \u201cthe power of loco-motion, of changing\nsituation, or removing one\u2019s person to whatsoever place one\u2019s own\ninclination may direct; without imprisonment or restraint, unless\nby due course of law.\u201d 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of\nEngland 130 (1769) (Blackstone). That definition is drawn from the\nhistorical roots of the Clauses and is consistent with our\nConstitution\u2019s text and structure.Both of the Constitution\u2019s Due Process Clauses\nreach back to Magna Carta. SeeDavidsonv.New\nOrleans, 96 U.\u00a0S. 97 \u2013102 (1878). Chapter 39 of the\noriginal Magna Carta provided, \u201cNo free man shall be taken,\nimprisoned, disseised, outlawed, banished, or in any way destroyed,\nnor will We proceed against or prosecute him, except by the lawful\njudgment of his peers and by the law of the land.\u201d Magna Carta, ch.\n39, in A. Howard, Magna Carta: Text and Commentary 43 (1964).\nAlthough the 1215 version of Magna Carta was in effect for only a\nfew weeks, this provision was later reissued in 1225 with modest\nchanges to its wording as follows: \u201cNo freeman shall be taken, or\nimprisoned, or be disseised of his freehold, or liberties, or free\ncustoms, or be outlawed, or exiled, or any otherwise destroyed; nor\nwill we not pass upon him, nor condemn him, but by lawful judgment\nof his peers or by the law of the land.\u201d 1 E. Coke, The Second Part\nof the Institutes of the Laws of England 45 (1797). In his\ninfluential commentary on the provision many years later, Sir\nEdward Coke interpreted the words \u201cby the law of the land\u201d to mean\nthe same thing as \u201cby due proces of the common law.\u201dId.,at\n50.After Magna Carta became subject to renewed\ninterest in the 17th century, see,e.g., ibid., William\nBlackstone referred to this provision as protecting the \u201cabsolute\nrights of every Englishman.\u201d 1 Blackstone 123. And he formulated\nthose absolute rights as \u201cthe right of personal secu-rity,\u201d which\nincluded the right to life; \u201cthe right of personal liberty\u201d; and\n\u201cthe right of private property.\u201dId.,at 125. He defined\n\u201cthe right of personal liberty\u201d as \u201cthe power of loco-motion, of\nchanging situation, or removing one\u2019s person to whatsoever place\none\u2019s own inclination may direct; without imprisonment or\nrestraint, unless by due course of law.\u201dId., at 125,\n130.[2]The Framers drew heavily upon Blackstone\u2019s\nformulation, adopting provisions in early State Constitutions that\nreplicated Magna Carta\u2019s language, but were modified to refer\nspecifically to \u201clife, liberty, or property.\u201d[3] State decisions interpreting these provisions\nbetween the founding and the ratification of the Fourteenth\nAmendment almost uniformly construed the word \u201cliberty\u201d to refer\nonly to freedom from physical restraint. See Warren, The New\n\u201cLiberty\u201d Under the Fourteenth Amendment, 39 Harv. L.\u00a0Rev.\n431, 441\u2013445 (1926). Even one case that has been identified as a\npossible exception to that view merely used broad language about\nliberty in the context of a habeas corpus proceeding\u2014a proceeding\nclassically associated with obtaining freedom from physical\nrestraint. Cf.id.,at 444\u2013445.In enacting the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process\nClause, the Framers similarly chose to employ the \u201clife, liberty,\nor property\u201d formulation, though they otherwise deviated\nsubstantially from the States\u2019 use of Magna Carta\u2019s language in the\nClause. See Shattuck, The True Meaning of the Term \u201cLiberty\u201d in\nThose Clauses in the Federal and State Constitutions Which Protect\n\u201cLife, Liberty, and Property,\u201d 4 Harv. L.\u00a0Rev. 365, 382\n(1890). When read in light of the history of that formulation, it\nis hard to see how the \u201cliberty\u201d protected by the Clause could be\ninterpreted to include anything broader than freedom from physical\nrestraint. That was the consistent usage of the time when \u201cliberty\u201d\nwas paired with \u201clife\u201d and \u201cproperty.\u201d Seeid.,at 375. And\nthat usage avoids rendering superfluous those protections for\n\u201clife\u201d and \u201cproperty.\u201dIf the Fifth Amendment uses \u201cliberty\u201d in this\nnarrow sense, then the Fourteenth Amendment likely does as well.\nSeeHurtadov.California, 110 U.\u00a0S. 516 \u2013535\n(1884). Indeed, this Court has previously commented, \u201cThe\nconclusion is .\u00a0.\u00a0. irresistible, that when the same\nphrase was employed in the Fourteenth Amendment [as was used in the\nFifth Amendment], it was used in the same sense and with no greater\nextent.\u201dIbid. And this Court\u2019s earliest Fourteenth\nAmendment decisions appear to interpret the Clause as using\n\u201cliberty\u201d to mean freedom from physical restraint. InMunnv.Illinois, 94 U.\u00a0S. 113 (1877) , for example, the\nCourt recognized the relationship between the two Due Process\nClauses and Magna Carta, seeid.,at 123\u2013124, and implicitly\nrejected the dissent\u2019s argument that \u201c\u00a0\u2018liberty\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nencompassed \u201csomething more .\u00a0.\u00a0. than mere freedom from\nphysical restraint or the bounds of a prison,\u201did.,at 142\n(Field, J., dissenting). That the Court appears to have lost its\nway in more recent years does not justify deviating from the\noriginal meaning of the Clauses.2Even assuming that the \u201cliberty\u201d in those\nClauses encompasses something more than freedom from physical\nrestraint, it would not include the types of rights claimed by the\nmajority. In the American legal tradition, liberty has long been\nunderstood as individual freedomfromgovernmental action,\nnot as a righttoa particular governmental entitlement.The founding-era understanding of liberty was\nheavily influenced by John Locke, whose writings \u201con natural rights\nand on the social and governmental contract\u201d were cited \u201c[i]n\npamphlet after pamphlet\u201d by American writers. B. Bailyn, The\nIdeological Origins of the American Revolution 27 (1967). Locke\ndescribed men as existing in a state of nature, possessed of the\n\u201cperfect freedom to order their actions and dispose of their\npossessions and persons as they think fit, within the bounds of the\nlaw of nature, without asking leave, or depending upon the will of\nany other man.\u201d J. Locke, Second Treatise of Civil Government, \u00a74,\np. 4 (J. Gough ed. 1947) (Locke). Because that state of nature left\nmen insecure in their persons and property, they entered civil\nsociety, trading a portion of their natural liberty for an increase\nin their security. Seeid.,\u00a797, at 49. Upon consenting to\nthat order, men obtained civil liberty, or the freedom \u201cto be under\nno other legislative power but that established by consent in the\ncommonwealth; nor under the dominion of any will or restraint of\nany law, but what that legislative shall enact according to the\ntrust put in it.\u201dId.,\u00a722, at 13.[4]This philosophy permeated the 18th-century\npolitical scene in America. A 1756 editorial in the Boston Gazette,\nfor example, declared that \u201cLiberty in theState of Nature\u201d\nwas the \u201cinherent natural Right\u201d \u201cof each Man\u201d \u201cto make a free Use\nof his Reason and Understanding, and to chuse that Action which he\nthinks he can give the best Account of,\u201d but that, \u201cin Society,\nevery Man parts with a Small Share of hisnaturalLiberty,\nor lodges it in the publick Stock, that he may possess the\nRemainder without Controul.\u201d Boston Gazette and Country Journal,\nNo. 58, May 10, 1756, p. 1. Similar sentiments were expressed in\npublic speeches, sermons, and letters of the time. See 1 C. Hyneman\n& D. Lutz, American Political Writing During the Founding Era\n1760\u20131805, pp. 100, 308, 385 (1983).The founding-era idea of civil liberty as\nnatural liberty constrained by human law necessarily involved only\nthose freedoms that existedoutside ofgovernment. See\nHamburger, Natural Rights, Natural Law, and American Constitutions,\n102 Yale L.\u00a0J. 907, 918\u2013919 (1993). As one later commentator\nobserved, \u201c[L]iberty in the eighteenth century was thought of much\nmore in relation to \u2018negative liberty\u2019; that is, freedomfrom, not freedomto, freedom from a number of social\nand political evils, including arbitrary government power.\u201d J.\nReid, The Concept of Liberty in the Age of the American Revolution\n56 (1988). Or as one scholar put it in 1776, \u201c[T]he common idea of\nliberty is merely negative, and is only theabsence of\nrestraint.\u201d R. Hey, Observations on the Nature of Civil Liberty\nand the Principles of Government \u00a713, p. 8 (1776) (Hey). When the\ncolonists described laws that would infringe their liberties, they\ndiscussed laws that would prohibit individuals \u201cfrom walking in the\nstreets and highways on certain saints days, or from being abroad\nafter a certain time in the evening, or . . . restrain [them] from\nworking up and manufacturing materials of [their] own growth.\u201d\nDowner, A Discourse at the Dedication of the Tree of Liberty, in 1\nHyneman,supra, at 101. Each of those examples involved\nfreedoms that existed outside of government.BWhether we define \u201cliberty\u201d as locomotion or\nfreedom from governmental action more broadly, petitioners have in\nno way been deprived of it.Petitioners cannot claim, under the most\nplausible definition of \u201cliberty,\u201d that they have been imprisoned\nor physically restrained by the States for participating in\nsame-sex relationships. To the contrary, they have been able to\ncohabitate and raise their children in peace. They have been able\nto hold civil marriage ceremonies in States that recognize same-sex\nmarriages and private religious ceremonies in all States. They have\nbeen able to travel freely around the country, making their homes\nwhere they please. Far from being incarcerated or physically\nrestrained, petitioners have been left alone to order their lives\nas they see fit.Nor, under the broader definition, can they\nclaim that the States have restricted their ability to go about\ntheir daily lives as they would be able to absent governmental\nrestrictions. Petitioners do not ask this Court to order the States\nto stop restricting their ability to enter same-sex relationships,\nto engage in intimate behavior, to make vows to their partners in\npublic ceremonies, to engage in religious wedding ceremonies, to\nhold themselves out as married, or to raise children. The States\nhave imposed no such restrictions. Nor have the States prevented\npetitioners from approximating a number of incidents of marriage\nthrough private legal means, such as wills, trusts, and powers of\nattorney.Instead, the States have refused to grant them\ngovernmental entitlements. Petitioners claim that as a matter of\n\u201cliberty,\u201d they are entitled to access privileges and benefits that\nexist solelybecause ofthe government. They want, for\nexample, to receive the State\u2019simprimaturon their\nmarriages\u2014on state issued marriage licenses, death certificates, or\nother official forms. And they want to receive various monetary\nbenefits, including reduced inheritance taxes upon the death of a\nspouse, compensation if a spouse dies as a result of a work-related\ninjury, or loss of consortium damages in tort suits. But receiving\ngovernmental recognition and benefits has nothing to do with any\nunderstanding of \u201cliberty\u201d that the Framers would have\nrecognized.To the extent that the Framers would have\nrecognized a natural right to marriage that fell within the broader\ndefinition of liberty, it would not have included a right to\ngovernmental recognition and benefits. Instead, it would have\nincluded a right to engage in the very same activities that\npetitioners have been left free to engage in\u2014making vows, holding\nreligious ceremonies celebrating those vows, raising children, and\notherwise enjoying the society of one\u2019s spouse\u2014without governmental\ninterference. At the founding, such conduct was understood to\npredate government, not to flow from it. As Locke had explained\nmany years earlier, \u201cThe first society was between man and wife,\nwhich gave beginning to that between parents and children.\u201d Locke\n\u00a777, at 39; see also J. Wilson, Lectures on Law, in 2 Collected\nWorks of James Wilson 1068 (K. Hall and M. Hall eds. 2007)\n(concluding \u201cthat to the institution of marriage the true origin of\nsociety must be traced\u201d). Petitioners misunderstand the institution\nof marriage when they say that it would \u201cmean little\u201d absent\ngovernmental recognition. Brief for Petitioners in No. 14\u2013556, p.\n33.Petitioners\u2019 misconception of liberty carries\nover into their discussion of our precedents identifying a right to\nmarry, not one of which has expanded the concept of \u201cliberty\u201d\nbeyond the concept of negative liberty. Those precedents all\ninvolved absolute prohibitions on private actions associated with\nmarriage.Lovingv.Virginia, 388 U.\u00a0S. 1 (1967)\n, for example, involved a couple who was criminally prosecuted for\nmarrying in the District of Columbia and cohabiting in Virginia,id.,at 2\u20133.[5] They\nwere each sentenced to a year of imprisonment, suspended for a term\nof 25 years on the condition that they not reenter the Commonwealth\ntogether during that time.Id.,at 3.[6] In a similar vein,Zablockiv.Redhail, 434 U.\u00a0S. 374 (1978) , involved a man who was\nprohibited, on pain of criminal penalty, from \u201cmarry[ing] in\nWisconsin or elsewhere\u201d because of his outstanding child-support\nobligations,id.,at 387; seeid.,at 377\u2013378. AndTurnerv.Safley, 482 U.\u00a0S. 78 (1987) , involved\nstate inmates who were prohib-ited from entering marriages without\nthe permission of the superintendent of the prison, permission that\ncould not be granted absent compelling reasons,id.,at 82.\nInnoneof those cases were individuals denied solely\ngovernmental recognition and benefits associated with marriage.In a concession to petitioners\u2019 misconception of\nliberty, the majority characterizes petitioners\u2019 suit as a quest to\n\u201cfind .\u00a0.\u00a0. liberty by marrying someone of the same sex\nand having their marriages deemed lawful on the same terms and\nconditions as marriages between persons of the opposite sex.\u201dAnte,at 2. But \u201cliberty\u201d is not lost, nor can it be found\nin the way petitioners seek. As a philosophical matter, liberty is\nonly freedom from governmental action, not an entitlement to\ngovernmental benefits. And as a constitutional matter, it is likely\neven narrower than that, encompassing only freedom from physical\nrestraint and imprisonment. The majority\u2019s \u201cbetter informed\nunderstanding of how constitutional imperatives define\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. liberty,\u201dante,at 19,\u2014better informed, we\nmust assume, than that of the people who ratified the Fourteenth\nAmendment\u2014runs headlong into the reality that our Constitution is a\n\u201ccollection of \u2018Thou shalt nots,\u2019\u00a0\u201dReidv.Covert, 354 U.\u00a0S. 1, 9 (1957) (plurality opinion), not\n\u201cThou shalt provides.\u201dIIIThe majority\u2019s inversion of the original\nmeaning of liberty will likely cause collateral damage to other\naspects of our constitutional order that protect liberty.AThe majority apparently disregards the\npolitical process as a protection for liberty. Although men, in\nforming a civil society, \u201cgive up all the power necessary to the\nends for which they unite into society, to the majority of the\ncommunity,\u201d Locke \u00a799, at 49, they reserve the authority to\nexercise natural liberty within the bounds of laws established by\nthat society,id.,\u00a722, at 13; see also Hey \u00a7\u00a752, 54, at\n30\u201332. To protect that liberty from arbitrary interference, they\nestablish a process by which that society can adopt and enforce its\nlaws. In our country, that process is primarily representative\ngovernment at the state level, with the Federal Constitution\nserving as a backstop for that process. As a general matter, when\nthe States act through their representative governments or by\npopular vote, the liberty of their residents is fully vindicated.\nThis is no less true when some residents disagree with the result;\nindeed, it seems difficult to imagineanylaw on which all\nresidents of a State would agree. See Locke \u00a798, at 49 (suggesting\nthat society would cease to function if it required unanimous\nconsent to laws). What matters is that the process established by\nthose who created the society has been honored.That process has been honored here. The\ndefinition of marriage has been the subject of heated debate in the\nStates. Legislatures have repeatedly taken up the matter on behalf\nof the People, and 35 States have put the question to the People\nthemselves. In 32 of those 35 States, the People have opted to\nretain the traditional definition of marriage. Brief for\nRespondents in No. 14\u2013571, pp.\u00a01a\u20137a. That petitioners\ndisagree with the result of that process does not make it any less\nlegitimate. Their civil liberty has been vindicated.BAside from undermining the political processes\nthat protect our liberty, the majority\u2019s decision threatens the\nreligious liberty our Nation has long sought to protect.The history of religious liberty in our country\nis familiar: Many of the earliest immigrants to America came\nseeking freedom to practice their religion without restraint. See\nMcConnell, The Origins and Historical Understanding of Free\nExercise of Religion, 103 Harv. L.\u00a0Rev. 1409, 1422\u20131425\n(1990). When they arrived, they created their own havens for\nreligious practice.Ibid.Many of these havens were\ninitially homogenous communities with established religions.Ibid.By the 1780\u2019s, however, \u201cAmerica was in the wake of a\ngreat religious revival\u201d marked by a move toward free exercise of\nreligion.Id.,at 1437. Every State save Connecticut adopted\nprotections for religious freedom in their State Constitutions by\n1789,id.,at 1455, and, of course, the First Amendment\nenshrined protection for the free exercise of religion in the\nU.\u00a0S. Constitution. But that protection was far from the last\nword on religious liberty in this country, as the Federal\nGovernment and the States have reaffirmed their commitment to\nreligious liberty by codifying protections for religious practice.\nSee,e.g.,Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993,\n107Stat. 1488, 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72000bbet\u00a0seq.;\nConn. Gen. Stat. \u00a752\u2013571b (2015).Numerousamici\u2014even some not supporting\nthe States\u2014have cautioned the Court that its decision here will\n\u201chave unavoidable and wide-ranging implications for religious\nliberty.\u201d Brief for General Conference of Seventh-Day Adventists et\nal. asAmici Curiae5. In our society, marriage is not\nsimply a governmental institution; it is a religious institution as\nwell.Id.,at 7. Today\u2019s decision might change the former,\nbut it cannot change the latter. It appears all but inevitable that\nthe two will come into conflict, particularly as individuals and\nchurches are confronted with demands to participate in and endorse\ncivil marriages between same-sex couples.The majority appears unmoved by that\ninevitability. It makes only a weak gesture toward religious\nliberty in a single paragraph,ante,at 27. And even that\ngesture indicates a misunderstanding of religious liberty in our\nNation\u2019s tradition. Religious liberty is about more than just the\nprotection for \u201creligious organizations and persons .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nas they seek to teach the principles that are so fulfilling and so\ncentral to their lives and faiths.\u201dIbid.Religious liberty\nis about freedom of action in matters of religion generally, and\nthe scope of that liberty is directly correlated to the civil\nrestraints placed upon religious practice.[7]Although our Constitution provides some\nprotection against such governmental restrictions on religious\npractices, the People have long elected to afford broader\nprotections than this Court\u2019s constitutional precedents mandate.\nHad the majority allowed the definition of marriage to be left to\nthe political process\u2014as the Constitution requires\u2014the People could\nhave considered the religious liberty implications of deviating\nfrom the traditional definition as part of their deliberative\nprocess. Instead, the majority\u2019s decision short-circuits that\nprocess, with potentially ruinous consequences for religious\nliberty.IVPerhaps recognizing that these cases do not\nactually involve liberty as it has been understood, the majority\ngoes to great lengths to assert that its decision will advance the\n\u201cdignity\u201d of same-sex couples.Ante,at 3, 13, 26,\n28.[8] The flaw in that\nreasoning, of course, is that the Constitution contains no\n\u201cdignity\u201d Clause, and even if it did, the government would be\nincapable of bestowing dignity.Human dignity has long been understood in this\ncountry to be innate. When the Framers proclaimed in the\nDeclaration of Independence that \u201call men are created equal\u201d and\n\u201cendowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights,\u201d they\nreferred to a vision of mankind in which all humans are created in\nthe image of God and therefore of inherent worth. That vision is\nthe foundation upon which this Nation was built.The corollary of that principle is that human\ndignity cannot be taken away by the government. Slaves did not lose\ntheir dignity (any more than they lost their humanity) because the\ngovernment allowed them to be enslaved. Those held in internment\ncamps did not lose their dignity because the government confined\nthem. And those denied governmental benefits certainly do not lose\ntheir dignity because the government denies them those benefits.\nThe government cannot bestow dignity, and it cannot take it\naway.The majority\u2019s musings are thus deeply\nmisguided, but at least those musings can have no effect on the\ndignity of the persons the majority demeans. Its\nmischaracterization of the arguments presented by the States and\ntheiramicican have no effect on the dignity of those\nlitigants. Its rejection of laws preserving the traditional\ndefinition of marriage can have no effect on the dignity of the\npeople who voted for them. Its invalidation of those laws can have\nno effect on the dignity of the people who continue to adhere to\nthe traditional definition of marriage. And its disdain for the\nunderstandings of liberty and dignity upon which this Nation was\nfounded can have no effect on the dignity of Americans who continue\nto believe in them.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*Our Constitution\u2014like the Declaration of\nIndependence before it\u2014was predicated on a simple truth: One\u2019s\nliberty, not to mention one\u2019s dignity, was something to be shielded\nfrom\u2014not provided by\u2014the State. Today\u2019s decision casts that truth\naside. In its haste to reach a desired result, the majority\nmisapplies a clause focused on \u201cdue process\u201d to afford substantive\nrights, disregards the most plausible understanding of the\n\u201cliberty\u201d protected by that clause, and distorts the principles on\nwhich this Nation was founded. Its decision will have inestimable\nconsequences for our Constitution and our society. I respectfully\ndissent.Notes1The majority states that\nthe right it believes is \u201cpart of the liberty promised by the\nFourteenth Amendment is derived, too, from that Amendment\u2019s\nguarantee of the equal protection of the laws.\u201dAnte,at 19.\nDespite the \u201csynergy\u201d it finds \u201cbetween th[ese] two protections,\u201dante, at 20, the majority clearly uses equal protection only\nto shore up its substantive due process analysis, an analysis both\nbased on an imaginary constitutional protection and revisionist\nview of our history and tradition.2The seeds of this\narticulation can also be found in Henry Care\u2019s influential\ntreatise, English Liberties. First published in America in 1721, it\ndescribed the \u201cthree things, which the Law ofEngland.\u00a0.\u00a0. principally regards and taketh Care of,\u201d as\n\u201cLife,LibertyandEstate,\u201d and described\nhabeas corpus as the means by which one could procure one\u2019s\n\u201cLiberty\u201d from imprisonment. The Habeas Corpus Act, comment., in\nEnglish Liberties, or the Free-born Subject\u2019s Inheritance 185 (H.\nCare comp. 5th ed. 1721). Though he used the word \u201cLiberties\u201d by\nitself more broadly, see,e.g., id.,at 7, 34, 56, 58, 60,\nhe used \u201cLiberty\u201d in a narrow sense when placed alongside the words\n\u201cLife\u201d or \u201cEstate,\u201d see,e.g., id.,at 185,\n200.3Maryland, North Carolina,\nand South Carolina adopted the phrase \u201clife, liberty, or property\u201d\nin provisions otherwise tracking Magna Carta: \u201cThat no freeman\nought to be taken, or imprisoned, or disseized of his freehold,\nliberties, or privileges, or outlawed, or exiled, or in any manner\ndestroyed, or deprived of his life, liberty, or property, but by\nthe judgment of his peers, or by the law of the land.\u201d Md. Const.,\nDeclaration of Rights, Art. XXI (1776), in 3 Federal and State\nConstitutions, Colonial Charters, and Other Organic Laws 1688 (F.\nThorpe ed. 1909); see also S.\u00a0C. Const., Art. XLI (1778), in 6id.,at 3257; N.\u00a0C. Const., Declaration of Rights, Art.\nXII (1776), in 5id.,at 2788. Massachusetts and New\nHampshire did the same, albeit with some alterations to Magna\nCarta\u2019s framework: \u201c[N]o subject shall be arrested, imprisoned,\ndespoiled, or deprived of his property, immunities, or privileges,\nput out of the protection of the law, exiled, or deprived of his\nlife, liberty, or estate, but by the judgment of his peers, or the\nlaw of the land.\u201d Mass. Const., pt. I, Art. XII (1780), in 3id.,at 1891; see also N.\u00a0H. Const., pt. I, Art. XV\n(1784), in 4id.,at 2455.4Locke\u2019s theories heavily\ninfluenced other prominent writers of the 17th and 18th centuries.\nBlackstone, for one, agreed that \u201cnatural liberty consists properly\nin a power of acting as one thinks fit, without any restraint or\ncontrol, unless by the law of nature\u201d and described civil liberty\nas that \u201cwhich leaves the subject entire master of his own\nconduct,\u201d except as \u201crestrained by human laws.\u201d 1 Blackstone\n121\u2013122. And in a \u201ctreatise routinely cited by the Founders,\u201dZivotofskyv.Kerry,ante,at 5 (Thomas, J.,\nconcurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part), Thomas\nRutherforth wrote, \u201cBy liberty we mean the power, which a man has\nto act as he thinks fit, where no law restrains him; it may\ntherefore be called a mans right over his own actions.\u201d 1 T.\nRutherforth, Institutes of Natural Law 146 (1754). Rutherforth\nexplained that \u201c[t]he only restraint, which a mans right over his\nown actions is originally under, is the obligation of governing\nhimself by the law of nature, and the law of God,\u201d and that\n\u201c[w]hatever right those of our own species may have .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nto restrain [those actions] within certain bounds, beyond what the\nlaw of nature has prescribed, arises from some after-act of our\nown, from some consent either express or tacit, by which we have\nalienated our liberty, or transferred the right of directing our\nactions from ourselves to them.\u201dId.,at\n147\u2013148.5The suggestion of\npetitioners and theiramicithat antimiscegenation laws are\nakin to laws defining marriage as between one man and one woman is\nboth offensive and inaccurate. \u201cAmerica\u2019s earliest laws against\ninterracial sex and marriage were spawned by slavery.\u201d P. Pascoe,\nWhat Comes Naturally: Miscegenation Law and the Making of Race in\nAmerica 19 (2009). For instance, Maryland\u2019s 1664 law prohibiting\nmarriages between \u201c\u00a0\u2018freeborne English women\u2019\u00a0\u201d and\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018Negro Sla[v]es\u2019\u00a0\u201d was passed as part of the very act\nthat authorized lifelong slavery in the colony.Id.,at\n19\u201320.Virginia\u2019s antimiscegenation laws likewise were\npassed in a 1691 resolution entitled \u201cAn act for suppressing\noutlying Slaves.\u201d Act of Apr. 1691, Ch. XVI, 3 Va. Stat. 86 (W.\nHening ed. 1823) (reprint 1969) (italics deleted). \u201cIt was not\nuntil the Civil War threw the future of slavery into doubt that\nlawyers, legislators, and judges began to develop the elaborate\njustifications that signified the emergence of miscegenation law\nand made restrictions on interracial marriage the foundation of\npost-Civil War white suprem-acy.\u201d Pascoe,supra, at\n27\u201328.6The prohibition extended\nso far as to forbid even religious ceremonies, thus raising a\nserious question under the First Amendment\u2019s Free Exercise Clause,\nas at least oneamicusbrief at the time pointed out. Brief\nfor John J. Russell et\u00a0al. asAmici CuriaeinLovingv.Virginia, O.T. 1966, No. 395, pp.\n12\u201316.7Concerns about threats to\nreligious liberty in this context are not unfounded. During the\nhey-day of antimiscegenation laws in this country, for instance,\nVirginia imposed criminal penalties on ministers who performed\nmarriage in violation of those laws, though their religions would\nhave permitted them to perform such ceremonies. Va. Code Ann.\n\u00a720\u201360 (1960).8The majority also\nsuggests that marriage confers \u201cnobility\u201d on individuals.Ante,at 3. I am unsure what that means. People may choose\nto marry or not to marry. The decision to do so does not make one\nperson more \u201cnoble\u201d than another. And the suggestion that Americans\nwho choose not to marry are inferior to those who decide to enter\nsuch relationships is specious.",
