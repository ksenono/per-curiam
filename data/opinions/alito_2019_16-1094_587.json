The question now before us is\nwhether this provision is satisfied when a service packet that\nnames the foreign minister is mailed to the foreign state\u2019s embassy\nin the United States. We hold that it is not. Most naturally read,\n\u00a71608(a)(3) requires that a mailing be sent directly to the foreign\nminister\u2019s office in the minister\u2019s home country.IAUnder the FSIA, a foreign state is immune from\nthe jurisdiction of courts in this country unless one of several\nenumerated exceptions to immunity applies. 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7\u00a71604, 1605\u20131607. If a suit falls within one of these exceptions,\nthe FSIA provides subject-matter jurisdiction in federal district\ncourts. \u00a71330(a). The FSIA also provides for personal jurisdiction\n\u201cwhere service has been made under section 1608.\u201d \u00a71330(b).Section 1608(a) governs service of process on \u201ca\nforeign state or political subdivision of a foreign state.\u201d\n\u00a71608(a); Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 4(j)(1). In particular, it sets out\nin hierarchical order the following four methods by which\n\u201c[s]ervice .\u00a0.\u00a0. shall be made.\u201d 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a71608(a). The first method is by delivery of a copy of the summons\nand complaint \u201cin accordance with any special arrangement for\nservice between the plaintiff and the foreign state or political\nsubdivision.\u201d \u00a71608(a)(1). \u201c[I]f no special arrangement exists,\u201d\nservice may be made by the second method, namely, delivery of a\ncopy of the summons and complaint \u201cin accordance with an applicable\ninternational convention on service of judicial documents.\u201d\n\u00a71608(a)(2). If service is not possible under either of the first\ntwo methods, the third method, which is the one at issue in this\ncase, may be used. This method calls for\u201csending a copy of the summons and\ncomplaint and a notice of suit, together with a translation of each\ninto the official language of the foreign state,by any form of\nmail requiring a signed receipt, to be addressed and dispatchedby the clerk of the courtto the head of the ministry of foreign\naffairs of the foreign state concerned.\u201d \u00a71608(a)(3) (emphasis\nadded).Finally, if service cannot be made within 30\ndays under \u00a71608(a)(3), service may be effected by sending the\nservice packet \u201cby any form of mail requiring a signed receipt, to\nbe addressed and dispatched by the clerk of the court to the\nSecretary of State in Washington, District of Columbia,\u201d for\ntransmittal \u201cthrough diplomatic channels to the foreign state.\u201d\n\u00a71608(a)(4).Once served, a foreign state or political\nsubdivision has 60 days to file a responsive pleading. \u00a71608(d). If\nthe foreign state or political subdivision does not do this, it\nruns the risk of incurring a default judgment. See \u00a71608(e). A copy\nof any such default judgment must be \u201csent to the foreign state or\npolitical subdivision in the [same] manner prescribed for service.\u201dIbid.BOn October 12, 2000, the USSCole, a\nUnited States Navy guided-missile destroyer, entered the harbor of\nAden, Yemen, for what was intended to be a brief refueling stop.\nWhile refueling was underway, a small boat drew along the side of\ntheCole, and the occupants of the boat detonated explosives\nthat tore a hole in the side of theCole. Seventeen\ncrewmembers were killed, and dozens more were injured. Al Qaeda\nlater claimed responsibility for the attack.Respondents in this case are victims of the USSColebombing and their family members. In 2010, respondents\nsued petitioner, the Republic of Sudan, alleging that Sudan had\nprovided material support to al Qaeda for the bombing. See 28\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a71605A(a)(1), (c). Because respondents brought\nsuit under the FSIA, they were required to serve Sudan with process\nunder \u00a71608(a). It is undisputed that service could not be made\nunder \u00a71608(a)(1) or \u00a71608(a)(2), and respondents therefore turned\nto \u00a71608(a)(3). At respondents\u2019 request, the clerk of the court\nsent the service packet, return receipt requested, to: \u201cRepublic of\nSudan, Deng Alor Koul, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Embassy of the\nRepublic of Sudan, 2210 Massachusetts Avenue NW, Washington, DC\n20008.\u201d App. 172. The clerk certified that the service packet had\nbeen sent and, a few days later, certified that a signed receipt\nhad been returned.[1] After\nSudan failed to appear in the litigation, the District Court for\nthe District of Columbia held an evidentiary hearing and entered a\n$314 million default judgment against Sudan. Again at respondents\u2019\nrequest, the clerk of the court mailed a copy of the default\njudgment in the same manner that the clerk had previously used. See\n\u00a71608(e).With their default judgment in hand, respondents\nturned to the District Court for the Southern District of New York,\nwhere they sought to register the judgment and satisfy it through\norders requiring several banks to turn over Sudanese assets. See 28\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71963 (providing for registration of judgments\nfor enforcement in other districts). Pursuant to \u00a71610(c), the\nDistrict Court entered an order confirming that a sufficient period\nof time had elapsed following the entry and notice of the default\njudgment, and the court then issued three turnover orders.At this point, Sudan made an appearance for the\npurpose of contesting jurisdiction. It filed a notice of appeal\nfrom each of the three turnover orders and contended on appeal that\nthe default judgment was invalid for lack of personal jurisdiction.\nIn particular, Sudan maintained that \u00a71608(a)(3) required that the\nservice packet be sent to its foreign minister at his principal\noffice in Khartoum, the capital of Sudan, and not to the Sudanese\nEmbassy in the United States.The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit\nrejected this argument and affirmed the orders of the District\nCourt. 802 F.3d 399 (2015). The Second Circuit reasoned that,\nalthough \u00a71608(a)(3) requires that a service packet be mailed \u201cto\nthe head of the ministry of foreign affairs of the foreign state\nconcerned,\u201d the statute \u201cis silent as to a specific location where\nthe mailing is to be addressed.\u201dId.,at 404. In light of\nthis, the court concluded that \u201cthe method chosen by plaintiffs\u2014a\nmailing addressed to the minister of foreign affairs at the\nembassy\u2014was consistent with the language of the statute and could\nreasonably be expected to result in delivery to the intended\nperson.\u201dIbid.Sudan filed a petition for rehearing, and the\nUnited States filed anamicus curiaebrief in support of\nSudan\u2019s petition. The panel ordered supplemental briefing and heard\nadditional oral argument, but it once again affirmed, reiterating\nits view that \u00a71608(a)(3) \u201cdoes not specify that the mailing be\nsent to the head of the ministry of foreign affairsinthe\nforeign country.\u201d 838 F.3d 86, 91 (CA2 2016). The court thereafter\ndenied Sudan\u2019s petition for rehearing en banc.Subsequent to the Second Circuit\u2019s decision, the\nCourt of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit held in a similar case that\n\u00a71608(a)(3) \u201cdoes not authorize delivery of service to a foreign\nstate\u2019s embassy even if it correctly identifies the intended\nrecipient as the head of the ministry of foreign affairs.\u201dKumarv.Republic of Sudan, 880 F.3d 144, 158 (2018),\ncert. pending, No. 17\u20131269.We granted certiorari to resolve this conflict.\n585 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2018)IIAThe question before us concerns the meaning of\n\u00a71608(a)(3), and in interpreting that provision, \u201c[w]e begin \u2018where\nall such inquiries must begin: with the language of the statute\nitself.\u2019\u00a0\u201dCaraco Pharmaceutical Laboratories, Ltd.v.Novo Nordisk A/S,566 U.S.\n399, 412 (2012) (quotingUnited Statesv.Ron Pair\nEnterprises, Inc.,489 U.S.\n235, 241 (1989)). As noted, \u00a71608(a)(3) requires that service\nbe sent \u201cby any form of mail requiring a signed receipt, to be\naddressed and dispatched by the clerk of the court to the head of\nthe ministry of foreign affairs of the foreign state\nconcerned.\u201dThe most natural reading of this language is\nthat service must be mailed directly to the foreign minister\u2019s\noffice in the foreign state. Although this is not, we grant, the\nonly plausible reading of the statutory text, it is the most\nnatural one. See,e.g.,United Statesv.Hohri,482 U.S.\n64, 69\u201371 (1987) (choosing the \u201cmore natural\u201d reading of a\nstatute);ICCv.Texas,479 U.S.\n450, 456\u2013457 (1987) (same); see alsoFlorida Dept. of\nRevenuev.Piccadilly Cafeterias, Inc.,554 U.S.\n33, 41 (2008) (similar).A key term in \u00a71608(a)(3) is the past participle\n\u201caddressed.\u201d A letter or package is \u201caddressed\u201d to an intended\nrecipient when his or her name and \u201caddress\u201d is placed on the\noutside of the item to be sent. And the noun \u201caddress,\u201d in the\nsense relevant here, means \u201cthe designation of a place (as a\nresidence or place of business) where a person or organization may\nbe found or communicated with.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International\nDictionary 25 (1971) (Webster\u2019s Third); see also Webster\u2019s Second\nNew International Dictionary 30 (1957) (\u201cthe name or description of\na place of residence, business, etc., where a person may be found\nor communicated with\u201d); Random House Dictionary of the English\nLanguage 17 (1966) (\u201cthe place or the name of the place where a\nperson, organization, or the like is located or may be reached\u201d);\nAmerican Heritage Dictionary 15 (1969) (\u201c[t]he location at which a\nparticular organization or person may be found or reached\u201d); Oxford\nEnglish Dictionary 106 (1933) (OED) (\u201cthe name of the place to\nwhich any one\u2019s letters are directed\u201d). Since a foreign nation\u2019s\nembassy in the United States is neither the residence nor the usual\nplace of business of that nation\u2019s foreign minister and is not a\nplace where the minister can customarily be found, the most common\nunderstanding of the minister\u2019s \u201caddress\u201d is inconsistent with the\ninterpretation of \u00a71608(a)(3) adopted by the court below and\nadvanced by respondents.We acknowledge that there are circumstances in\nwhich a mailing may be \u201caddressed\u201d to the intended recipient at a\nplace other than the individual\u2019s residence or usual place of\nbusiness. For example, if the person sending the mailing does not\nknow the intended recipient\u2019s current home or business address, the\nsender might use the intended recipient\u2019s last known address in the\nhope that the mailing will be forwarded. Or a sender might send a\nmailing to a third party who is thought to be in a position to\nensure that the mailing is ultimately received by the intended\nrecipient. But in the great majority of cases, addressing a mailing\nto X means placing on the outside of the mailing both X\u2019s name and\nthe address of X\u2019s residence or customary place of work.Section 1608(a)(3)\u2019s use of the term\n\u201cdispatched\u201d points in the same direction. To \u201cdispatch\u201d a\ncommunication means \u201cto send [it] off or away (as to a special\ndestination) with promptness or speed often as a matter of official\nbusiness.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third 653; see also OED 478 (\u201cTo send off\npost-haste or with expedition or promptitude (a messenger, message,\netc., having an express destination)\u201d). A person who wishes to\n\u201cdispatch\u201d a letter to X will generally send it directly to X at a\nplace where X is customarily found. The sender will not \u201cdispatch\u201d\nthe letter in a roundabout way, such as by directing it to a third\nparty who, it is hoped, will then send it on to the intended\nrecipient.A few examples illustrate this point. Suppose\nthat a person is instructed to \u201caddress\u201d a letter to the Attorney\nGeneral of the United States and \u201cdispatch\u201d the letter\n(i.e., to \u201csend [it] off post-haste\u201d) to the Attorney\nGeneral. The person giving these instructions would likely be\ndisappointed and probably annoyed to learn that the letter had been\nsent to, let us say, the office of the United States Attorney for\nthe District of Idaho. And this would be so even though a\nU.\u00a0S. Attorney\u2019s office is part of the Department headed by\nthe Attorney General and even though such an office would very\nprobably forward the letter to the Attorney General\u2019s office in\nWashington. Similarly, a person who instructs a subordinate to\ndispatch a letter to the CEO of a big corporation that owns retail\noutlets throughout the country would probably be irritated to learn\nthat the letter had been mailed to one of those stores instead of\ncorporate headquarters. To \u201cdispatch\u201d a letter to an addressee\nconnotes sending it directly.A similar understanding underlies the venerable\n\u201cmailbox rule.\u201d As first-year law students learn in their course on\ncontracts, there is a presumption that a mailed acceptance of an\noffer is deemed operative when \u201cdispatched\u201d if it is \u201cproperly\naddressed.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 66, p. 161 (1979)\n(Restatement);Rosenthalv.Walker,111 U.S.\n185, 193 (1884). But no acceptance would be deemed properly\naddressed and dispatched if it lacked, and thus was not sent to,\nthe offer- or\u2019s address (or an address that the offeror held out as\nthe place for receipt of an acceptance). See Restatement \u00a7 66,\nCommentb.It is also significant that service under\n\u00a71608(a)(3) requires a signed returned receipt, a standard method\nfor ensuring delivery to the addressee. Cf. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary\n1096 (10th ed. 2014) (defining \u201ccertified mail\u201d as \u201c[m]ail for\nwhich the sender requests proof of delivery in the form of a\nreceipt signed by the addressee\u201d). We assume that certified mail\nsent to a foreign minister will generally be signed for by a\nsubordinate, but the person who signs for the minister\u2019s certified\nmail in the foreign ministry itself presumably has authority to\nreceive mail on the minister\u2019s behalf and has been instructed on\nhow that mail is to be handled. The same is much less likely to be\ntrue for an employee in the mailroom of an embassy.For all these reasons, we think that the most\nnatural reading of \u00a71608(a)(3) is that the service packet must bear\nthe foreign minister\u2019s name and customary address and that it be\nsent to the minister in a direct and expeditious way. And the\nminister\u2019s customary office is the place where he or she generally\nworks, not a farflung outpost that the minister may at most\noccasionally visit.BSeveral related provisions in \u00a71608 support\nthis reading. SeeDavisv.Michigan Dept. of\nTreasury,489 U.S.\n803, 809 (1989) (\u201cIt is a fundamental canon of statutory\nconstruction that the words of a statute must be read in their\ncontext and with a view to their place in the overall statutory\nscheme\u201d).1One such provision is \u00a71608(b)(3)(B). Section\n1608(b) governs service on \u201can agency or instrumentality of a\nforeign state.\u201d And like \u00a71608(a)(3), \u00a71608(b)(3)(B) requires\ndelivery of a service packet to the intended recipient \u201cby any form\nof mail requiring a signed receipt, to be addressed and dispatched\nby the clerk of the court.\u201d But \u00a71608(b)(3)(B), unlike \u00a71608(a)(3),\ncontains prefatory language saying that service by this method is\npermissible \u201cif reasonably calculated to give actual notice.\u201dRespondents read \u00a71608(a)(3) as embodying a\nsimilar requirement. See Brief for Respondents 34. At oral\nargument, respondents\u2019 counsel stressed this point, arguing that\nrespondents\u2019 interpretation of \u00a71608(a)(3) \u201cgives effect\u201d to the\n\u201cfamiliar\u201d due process standard articulated inMullanev.Central Hanover Bank & Trust Co.,339 U.S.\n306(1950), which is \u201cthe notion that [service] must be\nreasonably calculated to give notice.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 37\u201338.This argument runs up against two well-settled\nprinciples of statutory interpretation. First, \u201cCongress generally\nacts intentionally when it uses particular language in one section\nof a statute but omits it in another.\u201dDepartment of Homeland\nSecurityv.MacLean, 574 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2015)\n(slip op., at 7). Because Congress included the \u201creasonably\ncalculated to give actual notice\u201d language only in \u00a71608(b), and\nnot in \u00a71608(a), we resist the suggestion to read that language\ninto \u00a71608(a). Second, \u201cwe are hesitant to adopt an interpretation\nof a congressional enactment which renders superfluous another\nportion of that same law.\u201dMackeyv.Lanier Collection\nAgency & Service, Inc.,486 U.S.\n825, 837 (1988). Here, respondents encounter a superfluity\nproblem when they argue that the \u201caddressed and dispatched\u201d clause\nin \u00a71608(a)(3) gives effect to theMullanedue process\nstandard. They fail to account for the fact that \u00a71608(b)(3)(B)\ncontainsboththe \u201caddressed and dispatched\u201d and \u201creasonably\ncalculated to give actual notice\u201d requirements. If respondents were\ncorrect that \u201caddressed and dispatched\u201d means \u201creason- ably\ncalculated to give notice,\u201d then the phrase \u201creasonably calculated\nto give actual notice\u201d in \u00a71608(b)(3) would be superfluous. Thus,\nas the dissent agrees, \u00a71608(a)(3) \u201cdoes not deem a foreign state\nproperly served solely because the service method is reasonably\ncalculated to provide actual notice.\u201dPost,at 2 (opinion of\nThomas, J.).2Section 1608(b)(2) similarly supports our\ninterpretation of \u00a71608(a)(3). Section 1608(b)(2) provides for\ndelivery of a service packet to an officer or a managing or general\nagent of the agency or instrumentality of a foreign state or \u201cto\nany other agent authorized by appointment or by law to receive\nservice of process in the United States.\u201dThis language is significant for three reasons.\nFirst, it expressly allows service on an agent. Second, it\nspecifies the particular individuals who are permitted to be served\nas agents of the recipient. Third, it makes clear that service on\nthe agent may occurin the United Statesif an agent here\nfalls within the provision\u2019s terms.If Congress had contemplated anything similar\nunder \u00a71608(a)(3), there is no apparent reason why it would not\nhave included in that provision terms similar to those in\n\u00a71608(b)(2). Respondents would have us believe that Congress was\ncontent to have the courts read such terms into \u00a71608(a)(3). In\nview of \u00a71608(b)(2), this seems un- likely.[2] See alsopost,at 2 (\u201cNor does the FSIA\nauthorize service on a foreign state by utilizing an agent\ndesignated to receive process for the state\u201d).3Section 1608(c) further buttresses our reading\nof \u00a71608(a)(3). Section 1608(c) sets out the rules for determining\nwhen service \u201cshall be deemed to have been made.\u201d For the first\nthree methods of service under \u00a71608(a), service is deemed to have\noccurred on the date indicated on \u201cthe certification, signed and\nreturned postal receipt, or other proof of service applicable to\nthe method of service employed.\u201d \u00a71608(c)(2). The sole exception is\nservice under \u00a71608(a)(4), which requires the Secretary of State to\ntransmit a service packet to the foreign state through diplomatic\nchannels. Under this method, once the Secretary has transmitted the\npacket, the Secretary must send to the clerk of the court \u201ca\ncertified copy of the diplomatic note indicating when the papers\nwere transmitted.\u201d \u00a71608(a)(4). And when service is effected in\nthis way, service is regarded as having occurred on the transmittal\ndate shown on the certified copy of the diplomatic note.\n\u00a71608(c)(1).Under all these methods, service is deemed to\nhave occurred only when there is a strong basis for concluding that\nthe service packet will very shortly thereafter come into the hands\nof a foreign official who will know what needs to be done. Under\n\u00a71608(a)(4), where service is transmitted by the Secretary of State\nthrough diplomatic channels, there is presumably good reason to\nbelieve that the service packet will quickly come to the attention\nof a high-level foreign official, and thus service is regarded as\nhaving been completed on the date of transmittal. And under\n\u00a7\u00a71608(a)(1), (2), and (3), where service is deemed to have\noccurred on the date shown on a document signed by the person who\nreceived it from the carrier, Congress presumably thought that the\nindividuals who signed for the service packet could be trusted to\nensure that the service packet is handled properly and\nexpeditiously.It is easy to see why Congress could take that\nview with respect to a person designated for the receipt of process\nin a \u201cspecial arrangement for service between the plaintiff and the\nforeign state or political subdivision,\u201d \u00a71608(a)(1), and a person\nso designated under \u201can applicable international convention,\u201d\n\u00a71608(a)(2). But what about \u00a71608(a)(3), the provision now before\nus? Who is more comparable to those who sign for mail under\n\u00a7\u00a71608(a)(1) and (2)? A person who works in the office of the\nforeign minister in the minister\u2019s home country and is authorized\nto receive and process the minister\u2019s mail? Or a mailroom employee\nin a foreign embassy? We think the answer is obvious, and therefore\ninterpreting \u00a71608(a)(3) to require that a service packet be sent\nto a foreign minister\u2019s own office better harmonizes the rules for\ndetermining when service is deemed to have been made.Respondents seek to soften the blow of an\nuntimely delivery to the minister by noting that the foreign state\ncan try to vacate a default judgment under Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 55(c). Brief for Respondents 27. But that is a poor\nsubstitute for sure and timely receipt of service, since a foreign\nstate would have to show \u201cgood cause\u201d to vacate the judgment under\nthat Rule. Here, as with the previously mentioned provisions in\n\u00a71608, giving \u00a71608(a)(3) its ordinary meaning better harmonizes\nthe various provisions in \u00a71608 and avoids the oddities that\nrespondents\u2019 interpretation would create.CThe ordinary meaning of the \u201caddressed and\ndispatched\u201d requirement in \u00a71608(a)(3) also has the virtue of\navoiding potential tension with the Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure and the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.1Take the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure\nfirst. At the time of the FSIA\u2019s enactment, Rule 4(i), entitled\n\u201cAlternative provisions for service in a foreign-country,\u201d set out\ncertain permissible methods of service on \u201cpart[ies] in a foreign\ncountry.\u201d Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.\u00a04(i)(1) (1976). One such method\nwas \u201cby any form of mail, requiring a signed receipt, to be\naddressed and dispatched by the clerk of the courtto the party\nto be served.\u201d Rule 4(i)(1)(D) (emphasis added). Rule 4(i)(2)\nfurther provided that \u201cproof of service\u201d pursuant to that method\n\u201cshall include a receiptsigned by the addresseeor other\nevidence ofdelivery to the addresseesatisfactory to the\ncourt.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The current version of Rule 4 is similar.\nSee Rules 4(f\u00a0)(2)(C)(ii), 4(l)(2)(B).The virtually identical methods of service\noutlined in Rule 4 and \u00a71608(a)(3) pose a problem for respondents\u2019\nposition: If mailing a service packet to a foreign state\u2019s embassy\nin the United States were sufficient for purposes of \u00a71608(a)(3),\nthen it would appear to be easier to serve the foreign state than\nto serve a person in that foreign state. This is so because a\nreceipt signed by an embassy employee would not necessarily satisfy\nRule 4 since such a receipt would not bear the signature of the\nforeign minister and might not constitute evidence that is\nsufficient to show that the service packet had actually been\ndelivered to the minister. It would be an odd state of affairs for\na foreign state\u2019s inhabitants to enjoy more protections in federal\ncourts than the foreign state itself, particularly given that the\nforeign state\u2019s immunity from suit is at stake. The natural reading\nof \u00a71608(a)(3) avoids that oddity.2Our interpretation of \u00a71608(a)(3) avoids\nconcerns regarding the United States\u2019 obligations under the Vienna\nConvention on Diplomatic Relations. We have previously noted that\nthe State Department \u201chelped to draft the FSIA\u2019s language,\u201d and we\ntherefore pay \u201cspecial attention\u201d to the Department\u2019s views on\nsovereign immunity.Bolivarian Republic of Venezuelav.Helmerich & Payne Int\u2019l Drilling Co., 581 U.\u00a0S.\n___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 9). It is also \u201cwell settled that the\nExecutive Branch\u2019s interpretation of a treaty \u2018is entitled to great\nweight.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAbbottv.Abbott,560 U.S.\n1, 15 (2010) (quotingSumitomo Shoji America, Inc.v.Avagliano,457 U.S.\n176, 185 (1982)).Article 22(1) of the Vienna Convention provides:\n\u201cThe premises of the mission shall be inviolable. The agents of the\nreceiving State may not enter them, except with the consent of the\nhead of the mission.\u201d Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations,\nApr. 18, 1961, 23 U.\u00a0S. T. 3237, T. I. A. S. No. 7502. Since\nat least 1974, the State Department has taken the position that\nArticle 22(1)\u2019s principle of inviolability precludes serving a\nforeign state by mailing process to the foreign state\u2019s embassy in\nthe United States. See Service of Legal Process by Mail on Foreign\nGovernments in the United States, 71 Dept. State Bull. 458\u2013459\n(1974). In this case, the State Department has reiterated this view\ninamicus curiaebriefs filed in this Court and in the\nSecond Circuit. The Government also informs us that United States\nembassies do not accept service of process when the United States\nis sued in a foreign court, and the Government expresses concern\nthat accepting respondents\u2019 interpretation of \u00a71608 might imperil\nthis practice. Brief for United States asAmicus Curiae25\u201326.Contending that the State Department held a\ndifferent view of Article 22(1) before 1974, respondents argue that\nthe Department\u2019s interpretation of the Vienna Convention is wrong,\nbut we need not decide this question. By giving \u00a71608(a)(3) its\nmost natural reading, we avoid the potential international\nimplications of a contrary interpretation.IIIRespondents\u2019 remaining arguments do not alter\nour conclusion. First, respondents contend that \u00a71608(a)(3) says\nnothing about where the service packet must be sent. See Brief for\nRespondents 22 (\u201cthe statute is silent as to the locationwherethe service packet should be sent\u201d). But while it is\ntrue that \u00a71608(a)(3) does not expressly provide where service must\nbe sent, it is common ground that this provision must implicitly\nimpose some requirement. Respondents acknowledge this when they\nargue that the provision demands that service be sent \u201cto a\nlocation that is likely to have a direct line of communication to\nthe foreign minister.\u201dId.,at 34; cf.post,at 6\n(stating that sending a letter to a Washington-based embassy \u201cwith\na direct line of communication\u201d to the foreign minister seems as\nefficient as sending it to the minister\u2019s office in the foreign\nstate). The question, then, is precisely what \u00a71608(a)(3)\nimplicitly requires. Respondents assure us that a packet sent to\n\u201can embassy plainly would qualify,\u201d while a packet sent to \u201ca\ntourism office plainly would not.\u201d Brief for Respondents 34. But if\nthe test is whether \u201ca location .\u00a0.\u00a0. is likely to have a\ndirect line of communication to the foreign minister,\u201dibid., it is not at all clear why service could not be sent\nto places in the United States other than a foreign state\u2019s\nembassy. Why not allow the packet to be sent, for example, to a\nconsulate? The residence of the foreign state\u2019s ambassador? The\nforeign state\u2019s mission to the United Nations? Would the answer\ndepend on the size or presumed expertise of the staff at the\ndelivery location? The difficult line-drawing problems that flow\nfrom respondents\u2019 interpretation of \u00a71608(a)(3) counsel in favor of\nmaintaining a clear, administrable rule: The service packet must be\nmailed directly to the foreign minister at the minister\u2019s office in\nthe foreign state.Second, respondents (and the dissent, seepost,at 5\u20136) contrast the language of \u00a71608(a)(3) with that\nof \u00a71608(a)(4), which says that service by this method requires\nthat process be sent to the Secretary of State in \u201cWashington,\nDistrict of Columbia.\u201d If Congress wanted to require that process\nunder \u00a71608(a)(3) be sent to a foreign minister\u2019s office in the\nminister\u2019s home country, respondents ask, why didn\u2019t Congress use a\nformulation similar to that in \u00a71608(a)(4)? This is respondents\u2019\nstrongest argument, and in the end, we see no entirely satisfactory\nresponse other than that \u00a71608(a) does not represent an example of\nperfect draftsmanship. We grant that the argument based on the\ncontrasting language in \u00a71608(a)(4) cuts in respondents\u2019 favor, but\nit is outweighed in our judgment by the countervailing arguments\nalready noted.Finally, respondents contend that it would be\n\u201cthe height of unfairness to throw out [their] judgment\u201d based on\nthe highly technical argument belatedly raised by petitioner. See\nBrief for Respondents 35. We understand respondents\u2019 exasperation\nand recognize that enforcing compliance with \u00a71608(a)(3) may seem\nlike an empty formality in this particular case, which involves\nhighly publicized litigation of which the Government of Sudan may\nhave been aware prior to entry of default judgment. But there are\ncircumstances in which the rule of law demands adherence to strict\nrequirements even when the equities of a particular case may seem\nto point in the opposite direction. The service rules set out in\n\u00a71608(a)(3), which apply to a category of cases with sensitive\ndiplo- matic implications, clearly fall into this category. Under\nthose rules, all cases must be treated the same.Moreover, as respondents\u2019 counsel acknowledged\nat oral argument, holding that Sudan was not properly served under\n\u00a71608(a)(3) is not the end of the road. Tr. of Oral Arg. 56.\nRespondents may attempt service once again under \u00a71608(a)(3), and\nif that attempt fails, they may turn to \u00a71608(a)(4). When asked at\nargument to provide examples of any problems with service under\n\u00a71608(a)(4), respondents\u2019 counsel stated that he was unaware of any\ncases where such service failed.Id.,at 59\u201362.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*We interpret \u00a71608(a)(3) as it is most\nnaturally understood: A service packet must be addressed and\ndispatched to the foreign minister at the minister\u2019s office in the\nforeign state. We therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of\nAppeals and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with\nthis opinion.It is so ordered.Notes1Sudan questions whether\nrespondents named the correct foreign minister and whether the\nSudanese Embassy received the service packet. Because we find the\nservice deficient in any event, we assume for the sake of argument\nthat the correct name was used and that the Embassy did receive the\npacket.2Notably, the idea of\ntreating someone at a foreign state\u2019s embassy as an agent for\npurposes of service on the foreign state was not unfamiliar to\nCongress. An earlier proposed version of the FSIA would have\npermitted service on a foreign state by sending the service packet\n\u201cto the ambassador or chief of mission of the foreign state.\u201d See\nS. 566, 93d Cong., 1st Sess., \u00a71608, p.\u00a06 (1973).",
