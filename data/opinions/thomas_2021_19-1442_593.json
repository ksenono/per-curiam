SAUL, COMMISSIONER OF SOCIAL\nSECURITYTHOMAS HILLIARD, PETITIONERv.ANDREW M. SAUL, COMMISSIONER OF SOCIAL\nSECURITYon writs of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the eighth circuit[April 22, 2021]Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Gorsuch and\nJustice Barrett join, concurring in part and concurring in the\njudgment.I join Parts I, II\u2013A, and II\u2013B\u20132 of the opinion\nof the Court, which correctly explain that the nonadversarial\nnature of an agency proceeding generally gives good reason to\nrefrain from creating an issue-exhaustion requirement. SeeSimsv.Apfel,530 U.S.\n103, 109\u2013110 (2000). Proceedings before an administrative law\njudge (ALJ) of the Social Security Administration are plainly\nnonadversarial: The regulations assure claimants that the agency\nwill \u201cconduct the administrative review process in an informal,\nnon-adversarial manner.\u201d 20 CFR \u00a7404.900(b) (2020). ALJs can raise\nnew issuessua\u00a0sponte. \u00a7\u00a7404.944, 404.946. Hearings are\nso informal that lawyers, briefs, and even attendance are often\noptional. \u00a7\u00a7404.948\u2013404.950. And should an ALJ err, the Appeals\nCouncil may review cases to correct anything from \u201cerror[s] of law\u201d\nto \u201cbroad policy or procedural issue[s] that may affect the general\npublic interest.\u201d \u00a7404.970(a). This decidedly pro-claimant,\ninquisitorial process is quite unlike an adversarial suit in which\nparties are expected to identify, argue, and preserve all\nissues.To be sure, a few regulatory provisions direct\nclaimants to advocate on their own behalf by objecting to problems,\nincluding if the agency misidentifies issues before the hearing or\nif the ALJ is \u201cprejudiced or partial.\u201d \u00a7\u00a7404.938\u2013404.940. But these\nunsurprising reminders that a claimant should not sit idly on the\nsidelines hardly demand that the penalty for overlooking an\nargument is forfeiture. On the contrary, such a permanent\nconsequence would be surprising in light of the flexible,\n\u201cinformal\u201d mechanisms that undergird the entire agency review\nprocess. \u00a7404.900(b); see alsoSims, 530 U.\u00a0S., at 110\n(plurality opinion) (\u201cThe differences between courts and agencies\nare nowhere more pronounced than in Social Security\nproceedings\u201d).Because these proceedings bear little\nresemblance to adversarial litigation, I agree with the Court that\nthere is no need for an exhaustion rule. I would end the analysis\nthere.",
