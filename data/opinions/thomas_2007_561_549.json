S. ____ (2007)SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESNO. 05-848ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE, et\u00a0al., PETITIONERSv.DUKE ENERGY CORPORATION et\u00a0al.on writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the fourth circuit[April 2, 2007]Justice Thomas, concurring in\npart.I join all but Part III\u2013A of the\nCourt\u2019s opinion. I write separately to note my disagreement with\nthe dicta in that portion of the opinion, which states that the\nstatutory cross-reference does not mandate a singular regulatory\nconstruction.The Prevention of Significant Deterioration\n(PSD) statute explicitly links the definition of the term\n\u201cmodification\u201d to that term\u2019s definition in the New Source\nPerformance Standard (NSPS) statute:\u201cThe term \u2018construction\u2019 when used in connection\nwith any source or facility, includes the modification (as defined\nin section 7411(a) of this title) of any source or facility.\u201d 42 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a77479(2)(C).Section 7411(a) contains the NSPS definition of\n\u201cmodification,\u201d which the parties agree is the relevant statutory\ndefinition of the term for both PSD and NSPS. Because of the\ncross-reference, the definitions of \u201cmodification\u201d in PSD and NSPS\nare one and the same. The term \u201cmodification\u201d therefore has the\nsame meaning despite contextual variations in the two admittedly\ndifferent statutory schemes. Congress\u2019 explicit linkage of PSD\u2019s\ndefinition of \u201cmodification\u201d to NSPS\u2019 prevents the Environmental\nProtection Agency (EPA) from adopting differing regulatory\ndefinitions of \u201cmodification\u201d for PSD and NSPS. Cf.IBP,\nInc.v.Alvarez,546 U. S. 21, 34 (2005)\n(concluding that an \u201cexplicit reference\u201d to a previous statutory\ndefinition prohibits interpreting the same word differently).Section 7479(2)(C)\u2019s cross-reference carries\nmore meaning than the mere repetition of the same word in a\ndifferent statutory context. When Congress repeats the same word in\na different statutory context, it is possible that Congress might\nhave intended the context to alter the meaning of the word. SeeAtlantic Cleaners & Dyers, Inc.v.United\nStates,286 U.\nS. 427, 433 (1932). No such possibility exists with\n\u00a77479(2)(C). By incorporating NSPS\u2019 definition of \u201cmodification,\u201d\nCongress demonstrated that it did not intend for PSD\u2019s definition\nof \u201cmodification\u201d to hinge on contextual factors unique to the PSD\nstatutory scheme. Thus,United Statesv.Cleveland\nIndians Baseball Co.,532 U. S. 200(2001),\nwhich analyzes the mere repetition of the same word in a different\nstatutory context, carries little weight in this situation.Likewise, this case differs from the\ncircumstance we faced inRobinsonv.Shell Oil\nCo.,519 U. S.\n337(1997). InRobinson, we considered whether\n\u201cemployee,\u201d as used in \u00a7704(a) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act\nof 1964, included former employees. We determined that under the\nclear language of the statute, certain statutory provisions using\nthe term \u201cemployee\u201d made sense only with respect to former\nemployees or current employees, but not both.Id., at\n342\u2013343. Accordingly, upon analyzing the context of \u00a7704(a), we\nwere compelled to conclude that the term \u201cemployee\u201d included former\nemployees. This case does not present a similar situation. The\nstatute here includes a statutory cross-reference, which conveys a\nclear congressional intent to provide a common definition for the\nterm \u201cmodification.\u201d And the contextual differences between PSD and\nNSPS do not compel different meanings for the term \u201cmodification.\u201dRobinsonis, therefore, inapplicable.Even if the cross-reference were merely the\nequivalent of repeating the words of the definition, we must still\napply our usual presumption that the same words repeated in\ndifferent parts of the same statute have the same meaning. SeeAtlantic Cleaners,supra, at 433;ante,\nat 9. That presumption has not been overcome here. While the\nbroadly stated regulatory goals of PSD and NSPS differ, these\ncontextual differences do not compel different definitions of\n\u201cmodification.\u201d That is, unlike inRobinson, reading the\nstatutory definition in the separate contexts of PSD and NSPS does\nnot require different interpretations of the term \u201cmodification.\u201d\nEPA demonstrated as much when it recently proposed regulations that\nwould unify the regulatory definitions of \u201cmodification.\u201d See 70\nFed. Reg. 61083, n. 3 (2005) (terming the proposal \u201can appropriate\nexercise of our discretion\u201d and stating that the unified definition\nbetter serves PSD\u2019s goals).The majority opinion does little to overcome\nthe presumption that the same words, when repeated, carry the same\nmeaning. Instead, it explains that this Court\u2019s cases do not compel\nidentical language to be interpreted identically in all situations.\nGranting that point, the majority still has the burden of stating\nwhy our general presumption does not control the outcome here. It\nhas not done so.",
