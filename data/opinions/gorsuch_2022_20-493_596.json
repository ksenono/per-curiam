Under our Constitution, treaties, and laws,\nCongress too bears vital responsibilities in the field of tribal\naffairs. See,e.g.,United Statesv.Lara,541 U.S.\n193, 200 (2004). From time to time, Congress has exercised its\nauthority to allow state law to apply on tribal lands where it\notherwise would not. SeeSanta Clara Pueblov.Martinez,436 U.S.\n49, 60 (1978);Bryanv.Itasca County,426 U.S.\n373, 392 (1976);Ricev.Olson,324 U.S.\n786, 789 (1945). In this case, Texas contends that Congress\nexpressly ordained that all of its gaming laws should be treated as\nsurrogate federal law enforceable on the Ysleta del Sur Pueblo\nReservation. In the end, however, we find no evidence Congress\nendowed state law with anything like the power Texas claims.IAThe Ysleta del Sur Pueblo is one of three\nfederally recognized Indian Tribes in Texas. Its reservation lies\nnear El Paso, and the Tribe today includes over 4,000 enrolled\nmembers. See About Us, Ysleta del Sur Pueblo (June 2022),\nhttps://www.ysletadelsurpueblo.org/about-us. The Tribe traces its\nroots back to the 1680 Pueblo Revolt against the Spanish in New\nMexico. In the revolt\u2019s aftermath, the Spanish retreated from\nSanta\u00a0Fe to El Paso, and a large number of Ysleta Pueblo\nIndians accompanied them. S.\u00a0Rep. No. 100\u201390, p. 6 (1987)\n(Senate Report); W. Timmons, El Paso 18 (1990) (Timmons). Soon,\ntribal members built the Ysleta Mission, the oldest church in\nTexas, and in 1751 Spain granted 23,000 acres to the Tribe for its\nhomeland. See Senate Report 6\u20137; Timmons 36.Things changed for the Tribe after Texas gained\nstatehood in 1845. The State disregarded Spain\u2019s land grant and\nbegan incorporating a town on tribal lands and issuing land patents\nto non-Indians. Senate Report 6\u20137. Over the years that followed,\nthe Tribe repeatedly lost lands \u201cwithout recompense.\u201d Timmons 181.\nYet some tribal members remained on parts of their homeland,\n\u201cdetermin[ed] to preserve [their] language, customs, and\ntraditions.\u201dIbid. In the late 1890s, the Tribe adopted a\nconstitution to ensure \u201cthe survival of [its] ancient tribal\norganization.\u201dIbid.After years of struggle, the Tribe also\nwon formal recognition from Texas in 1967 and Congress the\nfollowing year.Id., at 260\u2013261. In its 1968 legislation,\nCongress assigned its trust responsibilities for the Tribe to\nTexas. 82Stat. 93. That trust relationship was important, as it\nensured the Tribe would retain the remaining 100 acres of land it\npossessed and gain access to certain tribal funding programs. See\nTimmons 261; see also R. Chambers, Judicial Enforcement of the\nFederal Trust Responsibility to Indians, 27 Stan. L.\u00a0Rev.\n1213, 1233\u20131234 (1975) (discussing trust obligations).This arrangement persisted until 1983. That\nyear, Texas renounced its trust responsibilities, asserting that\nthey were inconsistent with the State\u2019s Constitution. See 2019 WL\n639971, *1 (WD Tex., Feb. 14, 2019). The Tribe responded to this\ndevelopment by seeking new congressional legislation to reestablish\nits trust relationship with the federal government. But that effort\nquickly became bogged down in a dispute. Of all things, it\nconcerned bingo. Texas, it seems, worried that allowing tribal\ngaming would have a detrimental effect on \u201cexisting charitable\nbingo operations in the State of Texas.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert.\n121. And because Texas judged that its laws would be inapplicable\non tribal lands without federal approval, the State opposed any new\nfederal trust legislation unless it included a special provision\npermitting it to apply its own gaming laws on the Tribe\u2019s lands.\nSeeibid.BYears of negotiations ensued. But one\ndevelopment during this period turned out to have particular\nsalience even though it did not immediately concern either the\nTribe or Texas. In February 1987, this Court issuedCaliforniav.Cabazon Band of Mission Indians,480 U.S.\n202. In it, the Court addressed Public Law 280, a statute\nCongress had adopted in 1953 to allow a handful of States to\nenforce some of their criminal\u2014but not certain of their civil\u2014laws\non particular tribal lands. SeeBryan, 426 U.\u00a0S., at\n383\u2013385. Seeking to apply that statutory direction in the context\nof Indian gaming, the Court held that, if a state lawprohibitsa particular game, it falls within Public Law\n280\u2019s grant of criminal jurisdiction and a State may enforce its\nban on tribal lands.Cabazon, 480 U.\u00a0S., at 209\u2013210.\nBut if state laws merelyregulatea game\u2019s availability, the\nCourt ruled, Public Law 280 does not permit a State to enforce its\nrules on tribal lands. Seeid., at 210\u2013211.The Court then turned to apply this\nprohibitory/regulatory distinction to California\u2019s bingo laws. Much\nlike Texas today, California in 1987 permitted bingo in various\ncircumstances (including for charitable purposes), but treated\ndeviations from its rules as criminal violations. Seeid.,\nat 205, 208\u2013209. Because California allowedsomebingo to be\nplayed, the Court reasoned, the State \u201cregulate[d] rather than\nprohibit[ed]\u201d the game.Id., at 211. From this, it followed\nthat Public Law 280 did not authorize the State to apply its own\nbingo laws on tribal lands.Id., at 210\u2013211. In reaching\nthis conclusion, the Court rejected California\u2019s suggestion that\nits laws were prohibitory rather than regulatory because they were\nenforceable by criminal sanctions, explaining that \u201can otherwise\nregulatory law\u201d is not enforceable under Public Law 280 merely\nbecause a State labels it \u201ccriminal.\u201dId., at 211.\n\u201cOtherwise,\u201d the Court explained, Public Law 280\u2019s \u201cdistinction\u201d\nbetween criminal and civil laws \u201ccould easily be avoided.\u201dIbid.It appears the Court\u2019s decision helped catalyze\nnew legislation. AfterCabazon, \u201ccongressional efforts to\npass [Indian gaming] legislation .\u00a0.\u00a0. that had been\nongoing since 1983 gained momentum, with Indian tribes\u2019 position\nstrengthened.\u201d W. Wood, The (Potential) Legal History of Indian\nGaming, 63 Ariz. L. Rev. 969, 1027, and n. 353 (2021) (Wood). In\nfact, just six months after the decision, in August 1987, Congress\nfinally adopted the Ysleta del Sur and Alabama and Coushatta Indian\nTribes of Texas Restoration Act, 101Stat. 666 (Restoration Act). In\nthat law, Congress restored the Tribe\u2019s federal trust status. And\nto resolve Texas\u2019s gaming objections, Congress seemingly drew\nstraight fromCabazon, employing its distinction between\nprohibited and regulated gaming activity. The Restoration Act\n\u201cprohibited\u201d as a matter of federal law \u201c[a]ll gaming activities\nwhich are prohibited by the laws of the State of Texas.\u201d 101Stat.\n668. But the Act also provided that it should not be \u201cconstrued as\na grant of civil or criminal regulatory jurisdiction to the State\nof Texas.\u201dId., at 669.That was not all Congress did. BecauseCabazonleft certain States unable to apply their gaming\nregulations on Indian reservations, some feared the Court\u2019s\ndecision opened the door to a significant amount of new and\nunregulated gaming on tribal lands. See R. Anderson, S. Krakoff,\n& B. Berger, American Indian Law: Cases and Commentary 479\u2013480\n(4th ed. 2020) (Anderson). In 1988, Congress sought to fill that\nperceived void by adopting its own comprehensive national\nlegislation: the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA), 102Stat.\n2467, 25 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7 2701et\u00a0seq.; Anderson\n479\u2013482. IGRA established rules for three separate classes of\ngames. Relevant here, the law permitted Tribes to offer so-called\nclass II games\u2014like bingo\u2014in States that \u201cpermi[t] such gaming for\nany purpose by any person, organization or entity.\u201d\n\u00a7\u00a02710(b)(1)(A). Meanwhile, the statute allowed Tribes to\noffer class III games\u2014like blackjack and baccarat\u2014but only pursuant\nto tribal/state compacts. \u00a7 2703(8); Anderson 480. To ensure\ncompliance with the statute\u2019s terms, IGRA created the National\nIndian Gaming Commission. \u00a7\u00a02704(a).CIn the 1990s, the Tribe sought to negotiate a\ncompact with Texas to offer class III games pursuant to IGRA. But\nTexas refused to come to the table. It argued that the Restoration\nAct displaced IGRA and required the Tribe to follow all of the\nState\u2019s gaming laws on tribal lands.That dispute quickly found its way to court.\nInitially, a federal district court granted summary judgment for\nthe Tribe, holding that Texas violated IGRA by failing to negotiate\nin good faith. On appeal, however, the Fifth Circuit reversed. That\ncourt held that the Restoration Act\u2019s directions superseded IGRA\u2019s\nand guaranteed that all of \u201cTexas\u2019 gaming laws and regulations\u201d\nwould \u201coperate as surrogate federal law on the Tribe\u2019s\nreservation.\u201dYsleta del Sur Pueblov.Texas,36 F.3d 1325, 1326, 1334 (1994) (Ysleta I).A quarter century of confusion and litigation\nfollowed. Repeatedly, the Tribe sought to conduct gaming operations\nwithin the confines ofYsleta Iat its Speaking Rock\nEntertainment Center, which houses restaurants, bars, and concert\nvenues. Repeatedly, Texas argued that the Tribe\u2019s activities\nexceeded the Fifth Circuit\u2019s mandate. Faced with these disputes,\nlower courts experimented with a variety of approaches: enjoining\nall on-reservation gaming, instructing the Tribe to seek licenses\nfrom Texas regulators, and even requiring the Tribe to obtain\npreapproval from a federal court before offering any new gaming\noperations. One court described this process as having \u201ctransformed\n[it] into a quasi-regulatory body overseeing and monitoring the\nminutiae of the [Tribe\u2019s] gaming-related conduct.\u201dTexasv.Ysleta del Sur Pueblo, 2016 WL 3039991, *19 (WD Tex., May\n27, 2016).DThe current case represents just the latest in\nthis long line. In 2016, the Tribe began offering bingo. On its\nview, it was free to offer at least this game because IGRA treats\nbingo as a class II game for which no state permission is required\nso long as the State permits the game to be played on some terms by\nsome persons. See 25 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a02710(b)(1)(A).\nCiting IGRA, the Tribe did not just offer the sort of bingo played\nin church halls across the country. It also offered \u201celectronic\nbingo,\u201d a game in which patrons sit at \u201cmachines [that] look\nsimilar to a traditional slot machine.\u201d 2019 WL 639971, *5\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Unlike typical slot machines,\nhowever, \u201cthe underlying game is run using historical bingo draws.\u201dIbid.The State responded by seeking to shut down all\nof the Tribe\u2019s bingo operations. Whatever IGRA may allow, Texas\nargued, the Fifth Circuit was clear inYsleta Ithat the\nRestoration Act forbids the Tribe from defying any of the State\u2019s\ngaming regulations. And, Texas stressed, under its laws bingo\nremains permissible today only for charitable purposes and only\nsubject to a broad array of regulations.Finding itself bound byYsleta I, the\nDistrict Court sided with Texas and enjoined the Tribe\u2019s bingo\noperations.But the court also chose to stay its injunction\npending appeal. The court did so because it thought that either the\nFifth Circuit or this Court might wish to reconsiderYsleta\nI. See 2019 WL 5589051, *1 (WD Tex., Mar. 28, 2019). After all,\nthe Restoration Act effectively federalizes only those state laws\nthatprohibitgaming activities. The statute expressly\nstates that nothing in it may be read as authorizing Texas to\nenforce criminal or civilregulationson tribal lands. And\nwhen it comes to bingo, the State permits at least some forms of\nthe game subject to regulation. In the District Court\u2019s judgment,\n\u201cthe Tribe [had] a sufficient likelihood of success on the merits\u201d\nunder the terms of the Restoration Act \u201cto support a stay.\u201dIbid. The District Court further found that, without a stay,\nthe injury to the Tribe would be \u201ctruly irreparable.\u201dId.,\nat *2. Speaking Rock\u2019s revenues account for 60 percent of the\nTribe\u2019s operating budget, which supports \u201csignificant educational,\ngovernmental, and charitable initiatives.\u201dIbid; Brief for\nPetitioners 17. And when Speaking Rock closed due to one of the\nmany previous disputes, tribal unemployment rose from 3 to 28\npercent. Seeid., at 18.On appeal, the Fifth Circuit \u201cre-reaffirm[ed]\u201dYsleta Iand held that the decision \u201cresolve[d] this\ndispute.\u201d 955 F.3d 408, 414, 417 (2020).YsletaIexpressly held that all of \u201cTexas\u2019 gaming laws and regulations\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. operate as surrogate federal law on the Tribe\u2019s\nreservation.\u201d 955 F.\u00a03d, at 414 (emphasis deleted). And\nbecause the Tribe\u2019s bingo operations did not conform to the State\u2019s\nbingo regulations, the court held, they were impermissible.Ibid.After the Tribe filed a petition for certiorari,\nthis Court called for the views of the Solicitor General. The\nUnited States argued that the Fifth Circuit\u2019s understanding of the\nRestoration Act took a wrong turn inYsleta Iand urged us\nto correct the error. See Brief for United States asAmicus\nCuriaeon Pet. for Cert. 1. Ultimately, we agreed to take up\nthis case to consider that question. 595 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2021).IIABefore us, the parties offer two very\ndifferent accounts of the Restoration Act. The State, in its only\nargument in support of regulatory jurisdiction over the Tribe\u2019s\ngaming activities, reads the Act as effectively subjecting the\nTribe to the entire body of Texas gaming laws and regulations, just\nas the Fifth Circuit held inYsleta I. The Tribe understands\nthe Act to bar it from offering only those gaming activities the\nState fully prohibits. Consistent withCabazon, the Tribe\nsubmits, if Texas merely regulates a game like bingo, it may offer\nthat game\u2014and it may do so subject only to the limits found in\nfederal law and its own law, not state law.To resolve the parties\u2019 disagreement, we turn to\n\u00a7 107 of the Restoration Act, where Congress directly addressed\ngaming on the Tribe\u2019s lands and said this:\u201cSEC. 107. GAMING ACTIVITIES.(a) In General.\u2014All gaming activities which\nare prohibited by the laws of the State of Texas are hereby\nprohibited on the reservation and on lands of the tribe. Any\nviolation of the prohibition provided in this subsection shall be\nsubject to the same civil and criminal penalties that are provided\nby the laws of the State of Texas. The provisions of this\nsubsection are enacted in accordance with the tribe\u2019s request in\nTribal Resolution No. T.C.\u201302\u201386 which was approved and certified\non March 12, 1986.(b) No State Regulatory Jurisdiction.\u2014Nothing in\nthis section shall be construed as a grant of civil or criminal\nregulatory jurisdiction to the State of Texas.(c) Jurisdiction Over Enforcement Against\nMembers.\u2014 [T]he courts of the United States shall have exclusive\njurisdiction over any offense in violation of subsection (a) that\nis committed by the tribe .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d 101Stat.\n668\u2013669.Perhaps the most striking feature about this\nlanguage is its dichotomy between prohibition and regulation. On\nthe one hand, subsection (a) says that gaming activitiesprohibitedby state law are also prohibited as a matter of\nfederal law (using some variation of the word \u201cprohibited\u201d no fewer\nthan three times). On the other hand, subsection (b) insists that\nthe statute does not grant Texas civil or criminalregulatoryjurisdiction with respect to matters covered by\nthis \u201csection,\u201d a section concerned exclusively with gaming. The\nimplication that Congress drew fromCabazonand meant for us\nto apply its same prohibitory/regulatory framework here seems\nalmost impossible to ignore. See Part II\u2013B,infra.But before getting to that, we start with a\ncareful look at the statute\u2019s terms standing on their own. Often\nenough in ordinary speech, toprohibitsomething means to\n\u201cforbid,\u201d \u201cprevent,\u201d or \u201ceffectively stop\u201d it, or \u201cmake [it]\nimpossible.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third International Dictionary 1813 (1986)\n(Webster\u2019s Third); see 7 Oxford English Dictionary 596 (2d ed.\n1989) (OED); Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1212 (6th ed. 1990) (Black\u2019s).\nMeanwhile, toregulatesomething is usually understood to\nmean to \u201cfix the time, amount, degree, or rate\u201d of an activity\n\u201caccording to rule[s].\u201d Webster\u2019s Third 1913; see 8 OED 524;\nBlack\u2019s 1286. Frequently, then, the two words are \u201cnot synonymous.\u201dId., at 1212.That fact presents Texas with a problem. The\nState concedes that its laws do not forbid, prevent, effectively\nstop, or make bingo impossible. Instead, the State admits that it\nallows the game subject to fixed rules about the time, place, and\nmanner in which it may be conducted. See Brief for Respondent 5.\nFrom this alone, it would seem to follow that Texas\u2019s laws fall on\nthe regulatory rather than prohibitory side of the line\u2014and thus\nmay not be applied on tribal lands under the terms of subsection\n(b).To be sure, Texas is not without a reply. It\nobserves that in everyday speech someone could describe its laws as\n\u201cprohibiting\u201d bingounlessthe State\u2019s time, place, and\nmanner regulations are followed. After all, conducting bingo or any\nother game in defiance of state regulations can lead not just to a\ncivil citation, but to a criminal prosecution too. See Tex. Occ.\nCode Ann. \u00a7 2001.551(c) (West 2019). In this sense, the State\nsubmits, it seeks to do exactly what subsection (a)\nallows\u2014\u201cprohibit\u201d bingo that is not conducted for charitable\npurposes and compliant with all its state gaming regulations.That much we find hard to see. Maybe in\nisolation or in another context, Texas\u2019s understanding of the word\n\u201cprohibit\u201d would make sense. But here it risks rendering the\nRestoration Act a jumble. No one questions that Texas \u201cregulates\u201d\nbingo by fixing the time, place, and manner in which the game may\nbe conducted. The State submits only that, in some sense, its lawsalso\u201cprohibit\u201d bingo\u2014when the game fails to comply with the\nState\u2019s time, place, and manner regulations. But on that reading,\nthe law\u2019s dichotomy between prohibition and regulation collapses.\nLaws regulating gaming activitiesbecomelaws prohibiting\ngaming activities. It\u2019s an interpretation that violates our usual\nrule against \u201cascribing to one word a meaning so broad\u201d that it\nassumes the same meaning as another statutory term.Gustafsonv.Alloyd Co.,513\nU.S. 561, 575 (1995). It\u2019s a view that defies our usual\npresumption that \u201cdifferences in language like this convey\ndifferences in meaning.\u201dHensonv.Santander Consumer USA\nInc., 582 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 6). And\nperhaps most tellingly, it is a construction that renders state\ngaming regulations simultaneously both (permissible) prohibitions\nand (impermissible) regulations. Rather than supply coherent\nguidance, Texas\u2019s reading of the law renders it an indeterminate\nmess.The State\u2019s interpretation of subsection (a)\npresents another related problem. Suppose we could somehow overlook\nthe indeterminacy its interpretation yields and adopt the State\u2019s\nview that it may \u201cprohibit\u201d bingo under subsection\u00a0(a) not\nmerely by outlawing bingo altogether but also by dictating the\ntime, place, and manner in which it is played. On that account,\nsubsection (b) would be left with no work to perform, its terms\ndead letters all. Yes, subsection (b)saysthat it does not\nfederalize Texas\u2019s civil and criminal gaming regulations on tribal\nland. But, the State effectively suggests, we should turn a blind\neye to all that. It\u2019s a result that defies yet another of our\nlongstanding canons of statutory construction\u2014this one, the rule\nthat we must normally seek to construe Congress\u2019s work \u201cso that\neffect is given to all provisions, so that no part will be\ninoperative or superfluous, void or insignificant.\u201dCorleyv.United States,556 U.S.\n303, 314 (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted).Seeking a way around these problems, Texas only\nstumbles on another. The State submits that subsection (b) performs\nreal work even on its reading by denying its courts and gaming\ncommission \u201cjurisdiction\u201d to punish violations of subsection (a)\nand sending disputes over \u201cregulatory\u201d violations to federal court\ninstead. The dissent also embraces this approach. Seepost,\nat 14\u201315. But this understanding of subsection (b) only serves to\nrender stillanotherportion of the statute\u2014subsection (c)\u2014a\nnullity. Titled \u201cJurisdiction Over Enforcement Against Members,\u201d\nsubsection (c) grants the federal courts \u201cexclusive\u201d jurisdiction\nover violations of subsection (a), and it also permits Texas to\n\u201cbrin[g] an action in [federal court] to enjoin violations of\n[subsection (a)].\u201d 101Stat. 669. Put differently, subsection (c)\nalready precludes state courts and state agencies from exercising\njurisdiction over violations of subsection (a). To make any sense\nof the statute, subsection (b) must do something besides repeat\nthat work.Stepping back, a full look at the statute\u2019s\nstructure suggests a set of simple and coherent commands. In\nsubsection\u00a0(a), Congress effectively federalized and applied\nto tribal lands those state laws that prohibit or absolutely ban a\nparticular gaming activity. In subsection (b), Congress explained\nthat it wasnotauthorizing the application of Texas\u2019s\ngaming regulations on tribal lands. In subsection\u00a0(c),\nCongress granted federal courts jurisdiction to entertain claims by\nTexas that the Tribe has violated subsection (a). Texas\u2019s competing\ninterpretation of the law renders individual statutory terms\nduplicative and whole provisions without work to perform.[1]BEven if fair questions remain after a look at\nthe ordinary meaning of the statutory terms before us, important\ncontextual clues resolve them. Recall that Congress passed the Act\njust six months after this Court handed downCabazon. See\nPart I\u2013B,supra. In that decision, the Court interpreted\nPublic Law 280 to mean that only \u201cprohibitory\u201d state gaming laws\ncould be applied on the Indian lands in question, not state\n\u201cregulatory\u201d gaming laws. The Court then proceeded to hold that\nCalifornia bingo laws\u2014laws materially identical to the Texas bingo\nlaws before us today\u2014fell on the regulatory side of the ledger.\nJust like Texas today, California heavily regulated bingo, allowing\nit only in certain circumstances (usually for charity). Just like\nTexas, California criminalized violations of its rules. CompareCabazon, 480 U.\u00a0S., at 205, with Tex. Occ. Code Ann.\n\u00a7\u00a02001.551. Still, because California permitted some forms of\nbingo, the Court concluded that meant California did not prohibit,\nbut only regulated, the game.Cabazon, 480 U.\u00a0S., at\n211.For us, that clinches the case. This Court\ngenerally assumes that, when Congress enacts statutes, it is aware\nof this Court\u2019s relevant precedents. SeeRyanv.Valencia\nGonzales,568 U.S.\n57, 66 (2013). And at the time Congress adopted the Restoration\nAct,Cabazonwas not onlyarelevant precedent\nconcerning Indian gaming; it wastheprecedent. See Part\nI\u2013B,supra. InCabazon, the Court drew a sharp line\nbetween the terms prohibitory and regulatory and held that state\nbingo laws very much like the ones now before us qualified as\nregulatory rather than prohibitory in nature. We do not see how we\nmight fairly read the terms of the Restoration Act except in the\nsame light. After all, \u201c[w]hen the words of the Court are used in a\nlater statute governing the same subject matter, it is respectful\nof Congress and of the Court\u2019s own processes to give the words the\nsame meaning in the absence of specific direction to the contrary.\u201dWilliamsv.Taylor,529 U.S.\n420, 434 (2000).Even beyond that vital contextual clue lie\nothers. In the immediate aftermath ofCabazon, Congress\nadopted not just the Restoration Act; it also adopted other laws\ngoverning tribal gaming activities. In these laws, Congress again\nappeared to reference and employCabazon\u2019s distinction\nbetween prohibition and regulation\u2014and Congress did so in ways\ndemonstrating that it clearly understood how to grant a State\nregulatory jurisdiction over a Tribe\u2019s gaming activities when it\nwished to do so. Cf.Lagosv.United States, 584\nU.\u00a0S. ___, ___\u2013___ (2018) (slip op., at 6\u20137).Consider two examples. On the same day it passed\nthe Restoration Act, Congress adopted a statute involving the\nWampanoag Tribe. But, contrary to its approach in the Restoration\nAct, Congress subjected that Tribe\u2019s lands to \u201cthose laws and\nregulations whichprohibit or regulatethe conduct of bingo\nor any other game of chance.\u201d Wampanoag Tribal Council of Gay Head,\nInc., Indian Claims Settlement Act of 1987, \u00a7 9, 101Stat. 709\u2013710\n(emphasis added). Shortly after the Restoration Act, Congress\nadopted another statute, this one governing the Catawba Tribe\u2019s\ngaming activities. In it, Congress provided that \u201call laws,\nordinances,and regulations of the State,and its political\nsubdivisions,shall govern the regulationof .\u00a0.\u00a0.\ngambling or wagering by the Tribe on and off the Reservation.\u201d\nCatawba Indian Tribe of South Carolina Land Claims Settlement Act\nof 1993, \u00a7\u00a014(b), 107Stat. 1136 (emphasis added).That Congress chose to use the language ofCabazonin different ways in three statutes closely related\nin time and subject matter seems to us too much to ignore. SeeState Farm Fire & Casualty Co.v.United Statesex\u00a0rel. Rigsby, 580 U.S. 26, 34 (2016) (explaining that\nwhen Congress \u201cuse[s] .\u00a0.\u00a0. explicit language in one\nprovision,\u201d that \u201ccautions against inferring the same limitation in\nanother provision\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). For two\nTribes, Congress did more than just prohibit on tribal lands those\ngaming activities prohibited by state law. It said state\nregulations should apply as a matter of federal law too. Yet forthisTribe Congress did something different. It did not\nsubject the Tribe to all Texas laws that \u201cprohibit or regulate\u201d\ngaming. It did not subject the Tribe to all laws that \u201cgovern the\nregulation of gambling.\u201d Instead, Congress banned on tribal lands\nonly those gaming activities \u201cprohibited\u201d by Texas, and it did not\nprovide for state \u201cregulatory jurisdiction\u201d over tribal\ngaming.[2]None of this is to say that the Tribe may offer\nany gaming activity on whatever terms it wishes. It is only to say\nthat the Fifth Circuit and Texas have erred in their understanding\nof the Restoration Act. Under that law\u2019s terms, if a gaming\nactivity is prohibited by Texas law it is also prohibited on tribal\nland as a matter of federal law. Other gaming activities are\nsubject to tribal regulation and must conform with the terms and\nconditions set forth in federal law, including IGRA to the extent\nit is applicable. See Brief for United States asAmicus\nCuriae31\u201333.[3]IIIABy this point, only two arguments remain for\nus to consider. In the first, Texas and the dissent focus heavily\non the final sentence in subsection (a). Seepost, at 9\u201310,\n13. That sentence states that \u201c[t]he provisions of this subsection\nare enacted in accordance with the tribe\u2019s request in Tribal\nResolution No. T.C.\u201302\u201386.\u201d 101Stat. 668\u2013669. In the referenced\n1986 resolution, the Tribe announced its opposition to Texas\u2019s\nlegislative efforts to have all its gaming laws apply on tribal\nlands. Such a result, the resolution said, would represent \u201ca\nsubstantial infringement upon the Tribe[\u2019s] power of\nself-government .\u00a0.\u00a0. [\u00a0i]nconsistent with the\ncentral purposes of restoration of the federal trust relationship.\u201d\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 122. At the same time, to prevent extension\nof Texas law to its reservation and to avoid \u201cjeopardiz[ing]\u201d its\nrequest for renewed federal trust status, the Tribe (1) announced\nits own intention to prohibit gaming or bingo on its reservation,\nand (2) authorized its negotiators in Washington to accept federal\nlegislation prohibiting gaming on tribal lands as an alternative to\nstate regulation.Id., at 123. Before us, Texas does not\nquestion that the Tribe was (and remains) free to change its own\nlaws after adopting that resolution. But, the State says, the fact\nthat Congress referenced the tribal resolution in subsection (a)\nsuggests that the Restoration Act should be read \u201cbroadly\u201d to allow\nTexas to apply its gaming regulations on tribal lands. Brief for\nRespondent 22.It\u2019s an unsatisfying suggestion for at least a\nfew reasons. In the first place, while subsection (a) explains that\nthe Restoration Act was \u201cenacted in accordance with\u201d the Tribe\u2019s\nresolution, it does not purport to incorporate that resolution into\nfederal law. Congress knows exactly how to adopt into federal law\nthe terms of another writing or resolution when it wishes. It can\nand has said, for example, that a tribal law or resolution \u201cshall\nhave the same force and effect as if it were set out in full in\nthis subchapter.\u201d 25 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a05396(b). But even\nTexas does not suggest that Congress went that far in the\nRestoration Act.With that possibility shelved, it is hard to see\nwhat\u2019s left. Texas suggests that Congress\u2019s reference to the tribal\nresolution at least augurs in favor of a \u201cbroa[d]\u201d reading of\nsubsection (a). Brief for Respondent 22; see alsopost, at\n9\u201310. But saying that tells us nothing about how much broader the\nlaw should be read. And, as we have seen, the only \u201cbroader\u201d\nreading of subsection (a) Texas offers faces its challenges\u2014 it\nrequires us to believe that subsection (a) swallows subsection (b)\nwhole, makes a nullity of subsection (c), and defies Congress\u2019s\napparent adoption ofCabazon\u2019s prohibitory/regulatory\ndistinction.There is still another and maybe more\nfundamental problem here. On our interpretation of the Restoration\nAct, Congressdidlegislate \u201cin accordance with\u201d the Tribe\u2019s\nresolution: It expressly granted the Tribe federal recognition and\nchose not to apply Texas gaming regulations as surrogate federal\nlaw on tribal land. Of course, Congress also sought to act in\naccordance with at least some of Texas\u2019s concerns by banning those\ngames fully barred by Texas law. In the end, it seems each got half\na loaf.By contrast, adopting Texas\u2019s alternative\ninterpretation of the Restoration Act would make a mockery of\nCongress\u2019s statement that it sought to act \u201cin accordance with\u201d the\nTribe\u2019s resolution. On the State\u2019s view,allof its gaming\nregulations serve as surrogate federal law applicable on tribal\nlands. That\u2019s a result few would dare to describe as \u201caccord[ing]\nwith\u201d the tribal resolution. In fact, it\u2019s an outcome more nearly\nthe opposite of what the Tribe sought and closer to what it\ndescribed as a \u201cwholly unsatisfactory .\u00a0.\u00a0. infringement\nupon the Tribe[\u2019s] power of self government\u201d and \u201c[i]nconsistent\nwith the central purposes of restoration of the federal trust\nrelationship.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 122.To be sure and as Texas and the dissent both\nhighlight, the statutory terms Congress finally settled on were in\nsome respects more generous to the Tribe than those its resolution\nauthorized tribal negotiators in Washington to accept. Rather than\nban all gaming on tribal lands, Congress banned only those games\nforbidden in Texas. But this development is hardly surprising\neither. The Tribe adopted its resolution in 1986 in connection with\nnegotiations over a bill that eventually died in the Senate. See\nBrief for United States asAmicus Curiae3\u20134, 30. As talks\ncontinued the following year, this Court issuedCabazon. And\nafter that, as we have seen, Tribes across the country saw their\nnegotiating \u201cposition strengthened.\u201d Wood 1027, and n. 353; see\nalso Part I\u2013B,supra. The dissent omits these essential\ndetails from its account of how the Restoration Act became law. Seepost, at 3. That omission leads the dissent to overlook one\nplausible explanation for why the Tribe got the deal it did. It may\nbe that, thanks toCabazon, the Tribe\u2019s representatives were\nable to persuade Congress to impose a less draconian ban\u2014one that\nparalleled the terms this Court inCabazonfound applicable\nto many other Tribes under Public Law 280. Surely, too, as we have\nseen, if Congress had intended a more complete federal ban, it\ncould have easily said so. Not by obliquely referencing a tribal\nresolution, but by saying so clearly, just as it did for both the\nWampanoag and Catawba Tribes. See Part II\u2013B,supra.[4]BIn the end, Texas retreats to the usual\nredoubt of failing statutory interpretation arguments: an unadorned\nappeal to public policy. Echoing arguments voiced by theCabazondissent, the State argues that attempts to\ndistinguish between prohibition and regulation are sure to prove\n\u201cunworkable.\u201d Brief for Respondent 29 (citing 480 U.\u00a0S., at\n224 (opinion of Stevens, J.)). Indeed, the State suggests that\nproblems are likely to arise in this very case. Under our reading,\nTexas highlights, courts on remand might be called on to decide\nwhether \u201celectronic bingo\u201d qualifies as \u201cbingo\u201d and thus a gaming\nactivity merely regulated by Texas, or whether it constitutes an\nentirely different sort of gaming activity absolutely banned by\nTexas and thus forbidden as a matter of federal law. And, the State\nworries, any attempt to answer that question may require evidence,\nexpert testimony, and further litigation.We appreciate these concerns, but they do not\npersuade us. Most fundamentally, they are irrelevant. It is not our\nplace to question whether Congress adopted the wisest or most\nworkable policy, only to discern and apply the policy it did adopt.\nIf Texas thinks good governance requires a different set of rules,\nits appeals are better directed to those who make the laws than\nthose charged with following them.Even on its own terms, we are not sure what to\nmake of Texas\u2019s policy argument. We do not doubt that the\nRestoration Act\u2019s prohibitory/regulatory distinction can and will\ngenerate borderline cases. See F. Cohen, Handbook of Federal Indian\nLaw 541\u2013544 (N. Newton ed. 2012). It may even be that electronic\nbingo will prove such a case. But if applying the Act\u2019s terms poses\nchallenges, that hardly makes it unique among federal statutes. Nor\nis the line the Restoration Act asks us to enforce quite as unusual\nas Texas suggests. Courts have applied the same\nprohibitory/regulatory framework elsewhere in this country under\nPublic Law 280 for decades. Seeid., at 541\u2013547. IGRA, too,\ndraws a similar line to assess the propriety of class II gaming on\nIndian reservations nationwide. See 25 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7\u00a02710(b)(1)(A); see also K. Washburn, Federal Law, State\nPolicy, and Indian Gaming, 4 Nev. L.\u00a0J. 285, 289\u2013290 (2004).\nIn fact, Texas concedes that another Tribe within its borders\u2014the\nKickapoo Traditional Tribe of Texas\u2014is already subject to IGRA and\noffers class II games. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 91; see also Brief for\nUnited States asAmicus Curiae32. Why something like theCabazontest can work for one Tribe in Texas but not another\nis not exactly obvious.For that matter, Texas\u2019s alternative\ninterpretation poses its own \u201cworkability\u201d challenges. Under the\nState\u2019s reading, subsection (c) does not just charge federal courts\nwith enforcing on tribal lands a federal law banning gaming\nactivities also banned by state law. It also charges federal courts\nwith enforcing the minutiae of state gaming regulations governing\nthe conduct of permissible games\u2014a role usually played by state\ngaming commissions or the National Indian Gaming Commission. It\u2019s a\nhighly unusual role for federal courts to assume. But on Texas\u2019s\nview, it\u2019s a role federal courtsmustassume, as indeed they\nhave sought to do sinceYsleta I. And far from yielding an\neasily administrable regime, by almost anyone\u2019s account that\nproject has engendered a quarter century of confusion and dispute.\nSee Part I\u2013C,supra.*Texas contends that Congress in the\nRestoration Act has allowed all of its state gaming laws to act as\nsurrogate federal law on tribal lands. The Fifth Circuit took the\nsame view inYsleta Iand in the proceedings below. That\nunderstanding of the law is mistaken. The Restoration Act bans as a\nmatter of federal law on tribal lands only those gaming activities\nalso banned in Texas. To allow the Fifth Circuit to revise its\nprecedent and reconsider this case in the correct light, its\njudgment is vacated, and the case is remanded for further\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.So ordered.Notes1The dissent offers a\nsurplusage argument of its own, arguing that the Court\u2019s reading of\n\u00a7 107 duplicates the work done by \u00a7 105(f\u00a0). Seepost,\nat 12. That is mistaken. Section 105(f\u00a0) does not specifically\naddress tribal gaming, but instead broadly extends Public Law 280\nand its associated jurisdictional rules to the Tribe\u2019s reservation.\nBy contrast, \u00a7 107 speaks only and specifically to gaming. And\nwhile it does extend much of the Public Law 280 regime to tribal\ngaming, it also departs from that framework in at least two\nsignificant ways. First, \u00a7\u00a0107 incorporates Texas\u2019s criminal\ngaming prohibitions as surrogatefederal law, while Public\nLaw 280 allows particular States to apply their own laws directly\nto tribal lands. Second, it establishes unique jurisdictional rules\nfor judicial review of alleged violations of Texas\u2019s gaming\nprohibitions. Seepost, at 13. Where Public Law 280 grantsstate courtsjurisdiction over violations of state criminal\nprohibitory laws, subsection (c) grantsfederal courtsexclusive jurisdiction over alleged violations of \u00a7\u00a0107,\n\u201c[n]otwithstanding section 105(f\u00a0).\u201d There is no superfluity\nhere.2The dissent speculates\nabout ways Congress could have even more clearly communicated its\nintention to ban only those games prohibited by Texas. Seepost, at 8\u20139. But rather than compare the Restoration Act to\nhypothetical language Congress could have used, it seems more\nappropriate to compare the Act\u2019s terms to language Congress did use\nin closely related statutes addressing precisely the same subject,\nincluding in one passed the very same day as this Act. The dissent\ncannot and does not deny that Congress could have employed the\nlanguage it used in the Wampanoag and Catawba statutes. That\nCongress took a different approach strongly suggests it had in mind\na different set of rules for this Tribe.3In reaching this\nconclusion, we need not rely on the rule\u2014long established by our\nprecedents\u2014that \u201cstatutes are to be construed liberally in favor of\nthe Indians, with ambiguous provisions interpreted to their\nbenefit.\u201dMontanav.Blackfeet Tribe,471 U.S.\n759, 766 (1985). On our view, Texas\u2019s interpretation fails even\nwithout recourse to that rule.4The dissent tries to\nreshape the tribal resolution to its liking by distilling it down\nto a \u201csingle \u2018request[\u00a0]\u2019\u00a0\u201d to \u201cban on the reservation\nall gaming as defined by Texas.\u201dPost, at 3, 9. And it\nchides the Court for consulting \u201cexcerpts from the Resolution\u2019s\npreamble\u201d that complicate the dissent\u2019s narrative.Post, at\n10. But theentire documentis an expression of the Tribe\u2019s\nviews. If we are to rely on the resolution as a snapshot of the\nTribe\u2019s position, it makes little sense to ignore much of it. In\nany event, courts regularly consult preambles and recitals even in\nstatutes and contracts. See A. Scalia & B. Garner, Reading Law\n217\u2013220 (2012).",
