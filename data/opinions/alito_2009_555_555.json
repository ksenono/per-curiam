S. ____ (2009)SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESNO. 06-1249WYETH, PETITIONERv.DIANA LEVINEon writ of certiorari to the supreme court of\nvermont[March 4, 2009]Justice Alito, with whom The\nChief Justice and Justice Scalia join, dissenting.This case illustrates that tragic\nfacts make bad law. The Court holds that a state tort jury, rather\nthan the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), is ultimately\nresponsible for regulating warning labels for prescription drugs.\nThat result cannot be reconciled withGeierv.American Honda Motor Co.,529 U. S. 861(2000), or general\nprinciples of conflict pre-emption. I respectfully dissent.IThe Court frames the question\npresented as a \u201cnarro[w]\u201d one\u2014namely, whether Wyeth has a duty to\nprovide \u201can adequate warning about using the IV-push method\u201d to\nadminister Phenergan.Ante, at 8. But that ignores the\nantecedent question of who\u2014the FDA or a jury in Vermont\u2014has the\nauthority and responsibility for determining the \u201cadequacy\u201d of\nPhenergan\u2019s warnings. Moreover, it is unclear how a \u201cstronger\u201d\nwarning could have helped respondent, seeante, at 16;\nafter all, the physician\u2019s assistant who treated her disregarded at\nleast six separate warnings that are already on Phenergan\u2019s\nlabeling, so respondent would be hard pressed to prove that a\nseventh would have made a difference.[Footnote 1]More to the point, the question\npresented by this case is not a \u201cnarrow\u201d one, and it does not\nconcern whether Phenergan\u2019s label should bear a \u201cstronger\u201d warning.\nRather, the real issue is whether a state tort jury can countermand\nthe FDA\u2019s considered judgment that Phenergan\u2019s FDA-mandated warning\nlabel renders its intravenous (IV) use \u201csafe.\u201d Indeed, respondent\u2019s\namended complaint alleged that Phenergan is \u201cnot reasonably safe\nfor intravenous administration,\u201d App. 15, \u00b66; respondent\u2019s attorney\ntold the jury that Phenergan\u2019s label should say, \u201c\u00a0\u2018Do not use\nthis drug intravenously,\u2019\u00a0\u201did., at 32; respondent\u2019s\nexpert told the jury, \u201cI think the drug should be labeled \u2018Not for\nIV use,\u2019\u00a0\u201did., at 59; and during his closing\nargument, respondent\u2019s attorney told the jury, \u201cThank God we don\u2019t\nrely on the FDA to \u2026 make the safe[ty] decision. You will make the\ndecision. \u2026 The FDA doesn\u2019t make the decision, you do,\u201did., at 211\u2013212.[Footnote\n2]Federal law, however,doesrely on\nthe FDA to make safety determinations like the one it made here.\nThe FDA has long known about the risks associated with IV push in\ngeneral and its use to administer Phenergan in particular. Whether\nwisely or not, the FDA has concluded\u2014over the course of extensive,\n54-year-long regulatory proceedings\u2014that the drug is \u201csafe\u201d and\n\u201ceffective\u201d when used in accordance with its FDA-mandated labeling.\nThe unfortunate fact that respondent\u2019s healthcare providers ignored\nPhenergan\u2019s labeling may make this an ideal medical-malpractice\ncase.[Footnote 3] But turning a\ncommon-law tort suit into a \u201cfrontal assault\u201d on the FDA\u2019s\nregulatory regime for drug labeling upsets the well-settled meaning\nof the Supremacy Clause and our conflict pre-emption jurisprudence.\nBrief for United States asAmicusCuriae21.IIATo the extent that \u201c[t]he purpose\nof Congress is the ultimate touchstone in every pre-emption case,\u201dMedtronic, Inc.v.Lohr,518 U. S. 470, 485\n(1996) (internal quotation marks omitted), Congress made its\n\u201cpurpose\u201d plain in authorizing the FDA\u2014not state tort juries\u2014to\ndetermine when and under what circumstances a drug is \u201csafe.\u201d\n\u201c[T]he process for approving new drugs is at least as rigorous as\nthe premarket approval process for medical devices,\u201dRiegelv.Medtronic, Inc., 552 U. S. ___, ___\n(2008) (slip op., at 11) (Ginsburg, J., dissenting), and we held\nthat the latter pre-empted a state-law tort suit that conflicted\nwith the FDA\u2019s determination that a medical device was \u201csafe,\u201did., at ___ (slip op., at 11) (opinion of the Court).Under the Federal Food, Drug, and\nCosmetic Act (FDCA), a drug manufacturer may not market a new drug\nbefore first submitting a new drug application (NDA) to the FDA and\nreceiving the agency\u2019s approval. See 21 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7355(a). An\nNDA must contain, among other things, \u201cthe labeling proposed to be\nused for such drug,\u201d \u00a7355(b)(1)(F), \u201cfull reports of investigations\nwhich have been made to show whether or not such drug is safe for\nuse and whether such drug is effective in use,\u201d \u00a7355(b)(1)(A), and\n\u201ca discussion of why the benefits exceed the risks [of the drug]\nunder the conditions stated in the labeling,\u201d 21 CFR\n\u00a7314.50(d)(5)(viii) (2008). The FDA will approve an NDA only if the\nagency finds, among other things, that the drug is \u201csafe for use\nunder the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the\nproposed labeling thereof,\u201d there is \u201csubstantial evidence that the\ndrug will have the effect it purports or is represented to have\nunder the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested\nin the proposed labeling thereof,\u201d and the proposed labeling is not\n\u201cfalse or misleading in any particular.\u201d 21 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7355(d).After the FDA approves a drug, the\nmanufacturer remains under an obligation to investigate and report\nany adverse events associated with the drug, see 21 CFR \u00a7314.80,\nand must periodically submit any new information that may affect\nthe FDA\u2019s previous conclusions about the safety, effectiveness, or\nlabeling of the drug, 21 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7355(k). If the FDA finds\nthat the drug is not \u201csafe\u201d when used in accordance with its\nlabeling, the agency \u201cshall\u201d withdraw its approval of the drug.\n\u00a7355(e). The FDA also \u201cshall\u201d deem a drug \u201cmisbranded\u201d if \u201cit is\ndangerous to health when used in the dosage or manner, or with the\nfrequency or duration prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the\nlabeling thereof.\u201d \u00a7352(j).Thus, a drug\u2019s warning label \u201cserves as the\nstandard under which the FDA determines whether a product is safe\nand effective.\u201d 50 Fed. Reg. 7470 (1985). Labeling is \u201c[t]he\ncenterpiece of risk management,\u201d as it \u201ccommunicates to health care\npractitioners the agency\u2019s formal, authoritative conclusions\nregarding the conditions under which the product can be used safely\nand effectively.\u201d 71 Fed. Reg. 3934 (2006). The FDA has underscored\nthe importance it places on drug labels by promulgating\ncomprehensive regulations\u2014spanning an entire part of the Code of\nFederal Regulations, see 21 CFR pt. 201, with seven subparts and 70\nseparate sections\u2014that set forth drug manufacturers\u2019 labeling\nobligations. Under those regulations, the FDA must be satisfied\nthat a drug\u2019s warning label contains, among other things, \u201ca\nsummary of the essential scientific information needed for the safe\nand effective use of the drug,\u201d \u00a7201.56(1), including a description\nof \u201cclinically significant adverse reactions,\u201d \u201cother potential\nsafety hazards,\u201d \u201climitations in use imposed by them, \u2026 and steps\nthat should be taken if they occur,\u201d \u00a7201.57(c)(6)(i). Neither the\nFDCA nor its implementing regulations suggest that juries may\nsecond-guess the FDA\u2019s labeling decisions.B1Where the FDA determines, in\naccordance with its statutory mandate, that a drug is on balance\n\u201csafe,\u201d our conflict pre-emption cases prohibit any State from\ncountermanding that determination. See,e.g.,Buckman\nCo.v.Plaintiffs\u2019 Legal Comm.,531 U. S. 341, 348 (2001) (after the\nFDA has struck \u201ca somewhat delicate balance of statutory\nobjectives\u201d and determined that petitioner submitted a valid\napplication to manufacture a medical device, a State may not use\ncommon law to negate it);International Paper Co.v.Ouellette,479 U. S. 481, 494\n(1987) (after the EPA has struck \u201cthe balance of public and private\ninterests so carefully addressed by\u201d the federal permitting regime\nfor water pollution, a State may not use nuisance law to \u201cupse[t]\u201d\nit);Chicago & North Western Transp. Co.v.Kalo\nBrick & Tile Co.,450 U. S. 311, 321\n(1981) (after the Interstate Commerce Commission has struck a\n\u201cbalance\u201d between competing interests in permitting the abandonment\nof a railroad line, a State may not use statutory or common law to\nnegate it).Thus, as the Court itself\nrecognizes, it is irrelevant in conflict pre-emption cases whether\nCongress \u201cenacted an express pre-emption provision at some point\nduring the FDCA\u2019s 70-year history.\u201dAnte, at 18; see alsoGeier, 529 U. S., at 869 (holding the absence of an\nexpress pre-emption clause \u201cdoesnotbar the ordinary\nworking of conflict pre-emption principles\u201d). Rather, the ordinary\nprinciples of conflict pre-emption turn solely on whether a State\nhas upset the regulatory balance struck by the federal agency.Id., at 884\u2013885; see alsoChicago & North Western\nTransp. Co.,supra, at 317 (describing conflict\npre-emption as \u201ca two-step process of first ascertaining the\nconstruction of the [federal and state laws] and then determining\nthe constitutional question whether they are actually in conflict\u201d\n(internal quotation marks omitted)).2A faithful application of this\nCourt\u2019s conflict pre-emption cases compels the conclusion that the\nFDA\u2019s 40-year-long effort to regulate the safety and efficacy of\nPhenergan pre-empts respondent\u2019s tort suit. Indeed, that result\nfollows directly from our conclusion inGeier.Geierarose under the\nNational Traffic and Motor Safety Vehicle Act of 1966, which\ndirects the Secretary of the Department of Transportation (DOT) to\n\u201cestablish by order \u2026 motor vehicle safety standards,\u201d 15 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a71392(a) (1988 ed.), which are defined as \u201cminimum\nstandard[s] for motor vehicle performance, or motor vehicle\nequipment performance,\u201d \u00a71391(2). Acting pursuant to that statutory\nmandate, the Secretary of Transportation promulgated Federal Motor\nVehicle Safety Standard 208, which required car manufacturers to\ninclude passive restraint systems (i.e., devices that work\nautomatically to protect occupants from injury during a collision)\nin a certain percentage of their cars built in or after 1987. See\n49 CFR \u00a7571.208 (1999). Standard 208 did not require installation\nof any particular type of passive restraint; instead, it gave\nmanufacturers the option to install automatic seatbelts, airbags,\nor any other suitable technology that they might develop, provided\nthe restraint(s) met the performance requirements specified in the\nrule.Ibid.Alexis Geier drove her 1987 Honda Accord into\na tree, and although she was wearing her seatbelt, she nonetheless\nsuffered serious injuries. She then sued Honda under state tort\nlaw, alleging that her car was negligently and defectively designed\nbecause it lacked a driver\u2019s-side airbag. She argued that Congress\nhad empowered the Secretary to set only \u201cminimum standard[s]\u201d for\nvehicle safety. 15 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71391(2). She also emphasized that\nthe National Traffic and Motor Safety Vehicle Act contains a saving\nclause, which provides that \u201c[c]ompliance with any Federal motor\nvehicle safety standard issued under this subchapter does not\nexempt any person from any liability under common law.\u201d\n\u00a71397(k).Notwithstanding the statute\u2019s saving clause,\nand notwithstanding the fact that Congress gave the Secretary\nauthority to set only \u201cminimum\u201d safety standards, we held Geier\u2019s\nstate tort suit pre-empted. In reaching that result, we relied\nheavily on the view of the Secretary of Transportation\u2014expressed in\nanamicusbrief\u2014that Standard 208 \u201c\u00a0\u2018embodies the\nSecretary\u2019s policy judgment that safety would best be promoted if\nmanufacturers installedalternativeprotection systems in\ntheir fleets rather than one particular system in every\ncar.\u2019\u00a0\u201d 529 U. S., at 881 (quoting Brief for United States asAmicus Curiae, O.\u00a0T. 1999, No. 98\u20131811, p. 25).\nBecause the Secretary determined that a menu of alternative\ntechnologies was \u201csafe,\u201d the doctrine of conflict pre-emption\nbarred Geier\u2019s efforts to deem some of those federally approved\nalternatives \u201cunsafe\u201d under state tort law.The same rationale applies here. Through\nPhenergan\u2019s label, the FDA offered medical professionals a menu of\nfederally approved, \u201csafe\u201d and \u201ceffective\u201d alternatives\u2014including\nIV push\u2014for administering the drug. Through a state tort suit,\nrespondent attempted to deem IV push \u201cunsafe\u201d and \u201cineffective.\u201d To\nbe sure, federal law does not prohibit Wyeth from contraindicating\nIV push, just as federal law did not prohibit Honda from installing\nairbags in all its cars. But just as we held that States may not\ncompel the latter, so, too, are States precluded from compelling\nthe former. See alsoFidelity Fed. Sav. & Loan Assn.v.De la Cuesta,458 U. S. 141, 155\n(1982) (\u201cThe conflict does not evaporate because the [agency\u2019s]\nregulation simply permits, but does not compel,\u201d the action\nforbidden by state law). If anything, a finding of pre-emption is\neven more appropriate here because the FDCA\u2014unlike the National\nTraffic and Motor Safety Vehicle Act\u2014contains no evidence that\nCongress intended the FDA to set only \u201cminimum standards,\u201d and the\nFDCA does not contain a saving clause.[Footnote 4] See alsoante, at 18 (conceding\nCongress\u2019 \u201csilence\u201d on the issue).IIIIn its attempt to evadeGeier\u2019s applicability to this case, the Court commits both\nfactual and legal errors. First, as a factual matter, it is\ndemonstrably untrue that the FDA failed to consider (and strike a\n\u201cbalance\u201d between) the specific costs and benefits associated with\nIV push. Second, as a legal matter,Geierdoes not stand\nfor the legal propositions espoused by the dissenters (and\nspecifically rejected by the majority) in that case. Third, drug\nlabeling by jury verdict undermines both our broader pre-emption\njurisprudence and the broader workability of the federal\ndrug-labeling regime.APhenergan\u2019s warning label has\nbeen subject to the FDA\u2019s strict regulatory oversight since the\n1950\u2019s. For at least the last 34 years, the FDA has focused\nspecifically on whether IV-push administration of Phenergan is\n\u201csafe\u201d and \u201ceffective\u201d when performed in accordance with\nPhenergan\u2019s label. The agency\u2019s ultimate decision\u2014to retain IV push\nas one means for administering Phenergan, albeit subject to\nstringent warnings\u2014is reflected in the plain text of Phenergan\u2019s\nlabel (sometimes in boldfaced font and all-capital letters). And\nthe record contains ample evidence that the FDA specifically\nconsidered and reconsidered the strength of Phenergan\u2019s\nIV-push-related warnings in light of new scientific and medical\ndata. The majority\u2019s factual assertions to the contrary are\nmistaken.1The FDA\u2019s focus on IV push as a\nmeans of administering Phenergan dates back at least to 1975. In\nAugust of that year, several representatives from both the FDA and\nWyeth met to discuss Phenergan\u2019s warning label. At that meeting,\nthe FDA specifically proposed \u201cthat Phenergan Injection should not\nbe used in Tubex\u00ae.\u201d 2 Record 583, 586 (Plaintiff\u2019s Trial Exh. 17,\nInternal Correspondence from W.\u00a0E. Langeland to File (Sept. 5,\n1975) (hereinafter 1975 Memo)). \u201cTubex\u201d is a syringe system used\nexclusively for IV push. See App. 43. An FDA official explained\nthat the agency\u2019s concerns arose from medical-malpractice lawsuits\ninvolving IV push of the drug, see 1975 Memo 586, and that the FDA\nwas aware of \u201c5 cases involving amputation where the drug had been\nadministered by Tubex together with several additional cases\ninvolving necrosis,\u201did., at 586\u2013587. Rather than\ncontraindicating Phenergan for IV push, however, the agency and\nWyeth agreed \u201cthat there was a need for better instruction\nregarding the problems of intraarterial injection.\u201dId.,\nat 587.The next year, the FDA convened\nan advisory committee to study, among other things, the risks\nassociated with the Tubex system and IV push. App. 294. At the\nconclusion of its study, the committee recommended an additional\nIV-push-specific warning for Phenergan\u2019s label, seeibid.,\nbut did not recommend eliminating IV push from the drug label\naltogether. In response to the committee\u2019s recommendations, the FDA\ninstructed Wyeth to make several changes to strengthen Phenergan\u2019s\nlabel, including the addition of upper case warnings related to IV\npush. Seeid., at 279\u2013280, 282\u2013283.In 1987, the FDA directed Wyeth to amend its\nlabel to include the following text:\u201c\u00a0\u2018[1] When used intravenously, [Phenergan]\nshould be given in a concentration no greater than 25 mg/ml and at\na rate not to exceed 25 mg/minute. [2] Injection through a properly\nrunning intravenous infusion may enhance the possibility of\ndetecting arterial placement.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId., at 311\u2013312.The first of the two quoted sentences refers\nspecifically to IV push; as respondent\u2019s medical expert testified\nat trial, the label\u2019s recommended rate of administration (not to\nexceed 25 mg per minute) refers to \u201cIV push, as opposed to say\nbeing in a bag and dripped over a couple of hours.\u201dId.,\nat 52. The second of the two quoted sentences refers to IV drip.\nSeeid., at 15\u201316 (emphasizing that a \u201crunning IV\u201d is the\nsame thing as \u201cIV drip\u201d).In its 1987 labeling order, the FDA cited\nvoluminous materials to \u201csuppor[t]\u201d its new and stronger warnings\nrelated to IV push and the preferability of IV drip.[Footnote 5]Id., at 313. One of\nthose articles specifically discussed the relative advantages and\ndisadvantages of IV drip compared to IV push, as well as the costs\nand benefits of administering Phenergan via IV push.[Footnote 6] The FDA also cited published\ncase reports from the 1960\u2019s of gangrene caused by the\nintra-arterial injection of Phenergan,[Footnote 7] and the FDA instructed Wyeth to amend\nPhenergan\u2019s label in accordance with the latest medical\nresearch.[Footnote 8] The FDA\nalso studied drugs similar to Phenergan and cited numerous\ncautionary articles\u2014one of which urged the agency to consider\ncontraindicating such drugs for IV use altogether.[Footnote 9]In \u201csupport\u201d of its labeling order, the FDA\nalso cited numerous articles that singled out the inner crook of\nthe elbow\u2014known as the \u201cantecubital fossa\u201d in the medical\ncommunity\u2014which is both a commonly used injection site, seeid., at 70 (noting that respondent\u2019s injection was pushed\ninto \u201cthe antecubital space\u201d), and a universally recognized\nhigh-risk area for inadvertent intra-arterial injections. One of\nthe articles explained:\u201cBecause of the numerous\nsuperficial positions the ulnar artery might occupy, it has often\nbeen entered during attempted venipuncture [of the antecubital\nfossa]. \u2026 However, the brachial and the radial arteries might also\nbe quite superficial in the elbow region\u2026\u00a0. The arterial\nvariations of the arm, especially in and about the cubital fossa,\nare common and numerous. If venipuncture must be performed in this\narea, a higher index of suspicion must be maintained to forestall\nmisdirected injections.\u201d Stone & Donnelly, The Accidental\nIntra-arterial Injection of Thiopental, 22 Anesthesiology 995, 996\n(1961) (footnote omitted; cited in App. 315, no.\u00a020).[Footnote 10]Based on this and other research, the FDA ordered\nWyeth to include a specific warning related to the use of the\nantecubital space for IV push.[Footnote 11]2When respondent was injured in\n2000, Phenergan\u2019s label specifically addressed IV push in several\npassages (sometimes in lieu of and sometimes in addition to those\ndiscussed above). For example, the label warned of the risks of\nintra-arterial injection associated with \u201caspiration,\u201d which is a\ntechnique used only in conjunction with IV push.[Footnote 12] The label also cautioned\nagainst the use of \u201csyringes with rigid plungers,\u201d App. 390, which\nare used only to administer the drug via IV push. As respondent\u2019s\nmedical expert testified at trial, \u201cby talking plungers and rigid\nneedles, that\u2019s the way you do it, to push it with the plunger.\u201dId., at 53 (testimony of Dr. John Matthew). Moreover,\nPhenergan\u2019s 2000 label devoted almost a full page to discussing the\n\u201cTubex system,\u201d seeid., at 391, which, as noted above, is\nused only to administer the drug via IV push.While Phenergan\u2019s label very\nclearly authorized the use of IV push, it also made clear that IV\npush is the delivery method of last resort. The label specified\nthat \u201c[t]he preferred parenteral route of administration is by deep\nintramuscular injection.\u201dId., at 390. If an intramuscular\ninjection is ineffective, then \u201cit is usually preferable to inject\n[Phenergan] through the tubing of an intravenous infusion set that\nis known to be functioning satisfactorily.\u201dIbid.See alsoid., at 50\u201351 (testimony of respondent\u2019s medical expert,\nDr. John Matthew) (conceding that the best way to determine that an\nIV set is functioning satisfactorily is to use IV drip). Finally,\nif for whatever reason a medical professional chooses to use IV\npush, he or she is on notice that \u201cINADVERTENT\nINTRA-ARTERIAL INJECTION CAN RESULT IN GANGRENE OF THE AFFECTED\nEXTREMITY.\u201dId., at 391; see alsoid., at 390\n(\u201cUnder no circumstances should Phenergan Injection be given by\nintra-arterial injection due to the likelihood of severe\narteriospasm and the possibility of resultant\ngangrene\u201d).Phenergan\u2019s label also directs\nmedical practitioners to choose veins wisely when using IV\npush:\u201cDue to the close proximity of arteries\nand veins in the areas most commonly used for intravenous\ninjection, extreme care should be exercised to avoid perivascular\nextravasation or inadvertent intra-arterial injection. Reports\ncompatible with inadvertent intra-arterial injection of Phenergan\nInjection, usually in conjunction with other drugs intended for\nintravenous use, suggest that pain, severe chemical irritation,\nsevere spasm of distal vessels, and resultant gangrene requiring\namputation are likely under such circumstances.\u201dIbid.Thus, it is\ndemonstrably untrue that, as of 2000, Phenergan\u2019s \u201clabeling did not\ncontain a specific warning about the risks of IV-push\nadministration.\u201d Ante, at 4. And whatever else might be said\nabout the extensive medical authorities and case reports that the\nFDA cited in \u201csupport\u201d of its approval of IV-push administration of\nPhenergan, it cannot be said that the FDA \u201cpaid no more than\npassing attention to\u201d IV push,ante, at 6; nor can it be\nsaid that the FDA failed to weigh its costs and benefits, Brief for\nRespondent 50.3For her part,\nrespondent does not dispute the FDA\u2019s conclusion that IV push has\ncertain benefits. At trial, her medical practitioners testified\nthat they used IV push in order to help her \u201cin a swift and timely\nway\u201d when she showed up at the hospital for the second time in one\nday complaining of \u201cintractable\u201d migraines, \u201cterrible pain,\u201d\ninability to \u201cbear light or sound,\u201d sleeplessness, hours-long\nspasms of \u201cretching\u201d and \u201cvomiting,\u201d and when \u201cevery possible\u201d\nalternative treatment had \u201cfailed.\u201d App. 40 (testimony of Dr. John\nMatthew);id., at 103, 106, 109 (testimony of physician\u2019s\nassistant Jessica Fisch).Rather than disputing\nthe benefits of IV push, respondent complains that the FDA and\nWyeth underestimated its costs (and hence did not provide\nsufficient warnings regarding its risks). But when the FDA mandated\nthat Phenergan\u2019s label read, \u201cINADVERTENT\nINTRA-ARTERIAL INJECTION CAN RESULT IN GANGRENE OF THE AFFECTED\nEXTREMITY,\u201did., at 391, and when the FDA required Wyeth\nto warn that \u201c[u]nder no circumstances should Phenergan Injection\nbe given by intra-arterial injection,\u201did., at 390, the\nagency could reasonably assume that medical professionals would\ntake care not to inject Phenergan intra-arterially. See also 71\nFed. Reg. 3934 (noting that a drug\u2019s warning label \u201ccommunicates to\nhealth care practitioners the agency\u2019s formal, authoritative\nconclusions regarding the conditions under which the product can be\nused safely and effectively\u201d). Unfortunately, the physician\u2019s\nassistant who treated respondent in this case disregarded\nPhenergan\u2019s label and pushed the drug into the single spot on her\narm that ismostlikely to cause an inadvertent\nintra-arterial injection.As noted above, when\nthe FDA approved Phenergan\u2019s label, it was textbook medical\nknowledge that the \u201cantecubital fossa\u201d creates a high risk of\ninadvertent intra-arterial injection, given the close proximity of\nveins and arteries. Seesupra, at 13\u201314; see also The\nLippincott Manual of Nursing Practice 99 (7th ed. 2001) (noting, in\na red-text \u201cNURSING ALERT,\u201d that the antecubital fossa is \u201cnot\nrecommended\u201d for administering dangerous drugs, \u201cdue to the\npotential for extravasation\u201d).[Footnote 13] According to the physician\u2019s assistant who\ninjured respondent, however, \u201c[i]t never crossed my mind\u201d that an\nantecubital injection of Phenergan could hit an artery. App. 110;\nsee alsoibid.(\u201c[It] just wasn\u2019t something that I was\naware of at the time\u201d). Oblivious to the risks emphasized in\nPhenergan\u2019s warnings, the physician\u2019s assistant pushed a double\ndose of the drug into an antecubital artery over the course of\n\u201c[p]robably about three to four minutes,\u201did., at 111;id., at 105, notwithstanding respondent\u2019s complaints of a\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018burn[ing]\u2019\u00a0\u201d sensation that she subsequently described\nas \u201c\u00a0\u2018one of the most extreme pains that I\u2019ve ever\nfelt,\u2019\u00a0\u201did., at 110, 180\u2013181. And when asked why she\nignored Phenergan\u2019s label and failed to stop pushing the drug after\nrespondent complained of burning pains, the physician\u2019s assistant\nexplained that it would have been \u201cjust crazy\u201d to \u201cworr[y] about an\n[intra-arterial] injection\u201d under the circumstances,id.,\nat 111.The FDA, however, did\nnot think that the risks associated with IV push\u2014especially in the\nantecubital space\u2014were \u201cjust crazy.\u201d That is why Phenergan\u2019s label\nso clearly warns against them.BGiven the\n\u201cbalance\u201d that the FDA struck between the costs and benefits of\nadministering Phenergan via IV push,Geiercompels the\npre-emption of tort suits (like this one) that would upset that\nbalance. The contrary conclusion requires turning yesterday\u2019s\ndissent into today\u2019s majority opinion.First,\nthe Court denies the existence of a federal-state conflict in this\ncase because Vermont merely countermanded the FDA\u2019s determination\nthat IV push is \u201csafe\u201d when performed in accordance with\nPhenergan\u2019s warning label; the Court concludes that there is no\nconflict because Vermont did not \u201cmandate a particular\u201d label as a\n\u201creplacement\u201d for the one that the jury nullified, and because the\nState stopped short of altogether \u201ccontraindicating IV-push\nadministration.\u201dAnte, at 8. But as we emphasized inGeier(over the dissent\u2019s assertions to the contrary), the\ndegree of a State\u2019s intrusion upon federal law is irrelevant\u2014the\nSupremacy Clause applies with equal force to a state tort law that\nmerely countermands a federal safety determination and to a state\nlaw that altogether prohibits car manufacturers from selling cars\nwithout airbags. Compare 529 U. S., at 881\u2013882, withid.,\nat 902 (Stevens, J., dissenting). Indeed, as recently as last Term,\nwe held that the Supremacy Clause pre-empts a \u201c[s]tate tort law\nthat requires a manufacturer\u2019s catheters to be safer, but hence\nless effective, than the model the FDA has approved\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201dRiegel, 552 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 11). It did not\nmatter there that the State stopped short of altogether prohibiting\nthe use of FDA-approved catheters\u2014just as it does not matter here\nthat Vermont stopped short of altogether prohibiting an\nFDA-approved method for administering Phenergan. See alsoLohr, 518 U. S., at 504 (Breyer, J., concurring in part\nand concurring in judgment) (noting it would be an \u201canomalous\nresult\u201d if pre-emption applied differently to a state tort suit\npremised on the inadequacy of the FDA\u2019s safety regulations and a\nstate law that specifically prohibited an FDA-approved\ndesign).Second, the Court\ntoday distinguishesGeierbecause the FDA articulated its\npre-emptive intent \u201cwithout offering States or other interested\nparties notice or opportunity for comment.\u201dAnte,\nat 21; see alsoante, at 24. But theGeierCourt\nspecifically rejected the argument (again made by the dissenters in\nthat case) that conflict pre-emption is appropriate only where the\nagency expresses its pre-emptive intent through notice-and-comment\nrulemaking. Compare 529 U. S., at 885 (\u201cTo insist on a specific\nexpression of agency intent to pre-empt, made after\nnotice-and-comment rulemaking, would be in certain cases to\ntolerate conflicts that an agency, and therefore Congress, is most\nunlikely to have intended. The dissent, as we have said, apparently\nwelcomes that result \u2026\u00a0. We do not\u201d), withid., at\n908\u2013910 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (emphasizing that \u201cwe generally\nexpect an administrative regulation to declare any intention to\npre-empt state law with some specificity,\u201d and that \u201c[t]his\nexpectation \u2026 serves to ensurethat States will be able\nto have a dialog with agencies regarding pre-emption decisionsex antethrough the normal notice-and-comment procedures\nof the Administrative Procedure Act\u201d (internal quotation marks\nomitted)). Indeed, pre-emption is arguably more appropriate here\nthan inGeierbecause the FDA (unlike the DOT) declared\nits pre-emptive intent in the Federal Register. See 71 Fed. Reg.\n3933\u20133936. Yet the majority dismisses the FDA\u2019s published preamble\nas \u201cinherently suspect,\u201dante, at 21, and an afterthought\nthat is entitled to \u201cno weight,\u201dante, at 25. CompareLohr,supra, at 506 (opinion of Breyer, J.)\n(emphasizing that the FDA has a \u201cspecial understanding of the\nlikely impact of both state and federal requirements, as well as an\nunderstanding of whether (or the extent to which) state\nrequirements may interfere with federal objectives,\u201d and that\n\u201c[t]he FDA can translate these understandings into particularized\npre-emptive intentions \u2026 through statements in \u2018regulations, pre-\nambles, interpretive statements, and responses to\ncomments\u2019\u00a0\u201d).Third, the\nCourt distinguishesGeierbecause the DOT\u2019s regulation\n\u201cbear[s] the force of law,\u201d whereas the FDA\u2019s preamble does not.Ante, at 24; see alsoante, at 19. But it is\nirrelevant that the FDA\u2019s preamble does not \u201cbear the force of law\u201d\nbecause the FDA\u2019s labeling decisions surely do. See 21 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a7355. It is well within the FDA\u2019s discretion to make its\nlabeling decisions through administrative adjudications rather than\nthrough less-formal and less-flexible rulemaking proceedings, seeSECv.Chenery Corp.,332 U. S. 194(1947),\nand we have never previously held that our pre-emption analysis\nturns on the agency\u2019s choice of the latter over the former.\nMoreover, it cannot be said thatGeier\u2019s outcome hinged on\nthe agency\u2019s choice to promulgate a rule. Seeante, at 19,\n24. TheGeierCourt relied\u2014again over the dissenters\u2019\nprotestations\u2014on materials other than the Secretary\u2019s regulation to\nexplain the conflict between state and federal law. Compare 529 U.\nS., at 881, withid., at 899\u2013900 (Stevens, J.,\ndissenting), andante, at 1\u20132 (Breyer, J.,\nconcurring).Fourth,\nthe Court sandwiches its discussion ofGeierbetween the\n\u201cpresumption against pre-emption,\u201dante, at 18, and heavy\nemphasis on \u201cthe longstanding coexistence of state and federal law\nand the FDA\u2019s traditional recognition of state-law remedies,\u201dante, at 24. But theGeierCourt specifically\nrejected the argument (again made by the dissenters in that case)\nthat the \u201cpresumption against pre-emption\u201d is relevant to the\nconflict pre-emption analysis. See 529 U. S., at 906\u2013907 (Stevens,\nJ., dissenting) (\u201c[T]he Court simply ignores the presumption\n[against pre-emption]\u201d). Rather than invoking such a \u201cpresumption,\u201d\nthe Court emphasized that it was applying \u201cordinary,\u201d\n\u201clongstanding,\u201d and \u201cexperience-proved principles of conflict\npre-emption.\u201dId., at 874. Under these principles, the\nsole question is whether there is an \u201cactual conflict\u201d between\nstate and federal law; if so, then pre-emption follows\nautomatically by operation of the Supremacy Clause.Id.,\nat 871\u2013872. See alsoBuckman, 531 U.

S., at 883; compareid.,\nat 910\u2013911 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (criticizing the majority for\n\u201cuph[olding] a regulatory claim of frustration-of-purposes implied\nconflict pre-emption based on nothing more than anex postadministrative litigating position and inferences from regulatory\nhistory and final commentary\u201d). See alsoLohr, 518 U. S.,\nat 496 (recognizing that the FDA is \u201cuniquely qualified\u201d to explain\nwhether state law conflicts with the FDA\u2019s objectives). Yet today,\nthe FDA\u2019s explanation of the conflict between state tort suits and\nthe federal labeling regime, set forth in the agency\u2019samicusbrief, is not even mentioned in the Court\u2019s\nopinion. Instead of relying on the FDA\u2019s explanation of its own\nregulatory purposes, the Court relies on a decade-old and\nnow-repudiated statement, which the majority finds preferable. Seeante, at 21\u201322, 24, n.\u00a013. Cf.Riegel, 552\nU.

And Justice Breyer suggests that state tort suits may\n\u201chelp the [FDA],\u201dante, at 1 (concurring opinion),\nnotwithstanding the FDA\u2019s insistence that state tort suits will\n\u201cdisrupt the agency\u2019s balancing of health risks and benefits,\u201d\nBrief for United States asAmicusCuriae9.Geierdoes not countenance the use\nof state tort suits to second-guess the FDA\u2019s labeling decisions.\nAnd the Court\u2019s contrary conclusion has potentially far-reaching\nconsequences.CBy their very nature, juries are ill-equipped\nto perform the FDA\u2019s cost-benefit-balancing function. As we\nexplained inRiegel, juries tend to focus on the risk of a\nparticular product\u2019s design or warning label that arguably\ncontributed to a particular plaintiff\u2019s injury, not on the overall\nbenefits of that design or label; \u201cthe patients who reaped those\nbenefits are not represented in court.\u201d 552 U. S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 12). Indeed, patients like respondent are the only ones\nwhom tort juries ever see, and for a patient like respondent\u2014who\nhas already suffered a tragic accident\u2014Phenergan\u2019s risks are no\nlonger a matter of probabilities and\npotentialities.In contrast, the FDA has the benefit of the\nlong view. Its drug-approval determinations consider the interests\nof all potential users of a drug, including \u201cthose who would suffer\nwithout new medical [products]\u201d if juries in all 50 States were\nfree to contradict the FDA\u2019s expert determinations.Id.,\nat ___ (slip op., at 13). And the FDA conveys its warnings with one\nvoice, rather than whipsawing the medical community with 50 (or\nmore) potentially conflicting ones. After today\u2019s ruling, however,\nparochialism may prevail.The\nproblem is well illustrated by the labels borne by \u201cvesicant\u201d\ndrugs, many of which are used for chemotherapy. As a class,\nvesicants are much more dangerous than drugs like\nPhenergan,[Footnote 15] but\nthe vast majority of vesicant labels\u2014like Phenergan\u2019s\u2014either allow\nor do not disallow IV push. See Appendix,infra. Because\nvesicant extravasation can have devastating consequences, and\nbecause the potentially lifesaving benefits of these drugs offer\nhollow solace to the victim of such a tragedy, a jury\u2019s\ncost-benefit analysis in a particular case may well differ from the\nFDA\u2019s.For\nexample, consider Mustargen (mechlorethamine HCl)\u2014the injectable\nform of mustard gas\u2014which can be used as an anticancer drug.\nMustargen\u2019s FDA-approved label warns in several places that\n\u201cThis drug is HIGHLY TOXIC.\u201d[Footnote 16] Indeed, the drug is so highly\ntoxic:\u201cShould accidental eye contact occur, copious irrigation for at\nleast 15 minutes with water, normal saline or a balanced salt\nophthalmic irrigating solution should be instituted immediately,\nfollowed by prompt ophthalmologic consultation. Should accidental\nskin contact occur, the affected part must be irrigated immediately\nwith copious amounts of water, for at least 15 minutes while\nremoving contaminated clothing and shoes, followed by 2% sodium\nthiosulfate solution. Medical attention should be sought\nimmediately. Contaminated clothing should be destroyed.\u201d[Footnote\n17]Yet\nwhen it comes to administering this highly toxic drug, the label\nprovides that \u201cthe drug may be injecteddirectly into any\nsuitable vein, [but] it is injected preferably into the rubber\nor plastic tubing of a flowing intravenous infusion set. This\nreduces the possibility of severe local reactions due to\nextravasation or high concentration of the drug.\u201d (Emphasis added.)\nSimilarly, the FDA-approved labels for other powerful\nchemotherapeutic vesicants\u2014including Dactinomycin, Oxaliplatin,\nVinblastine, and Vincristine\u2014specifically allow IV push,\nnotwithstanding their devastating effects when\nextravasated.The fact that the labels for such drugs allow\nIV push is striking\u2014both because vesicants are much more dangerous\nthan Phenergan, and also because they are so frequently\nextravasated, see Boyle & Engelking, Vesicant Extravasation:\nMyths and Realities, 22 Oncology Nursing Forum 57, 58 (1995)\n(arguing that the rate of extravasation is \u201cconsiderably higher\u201d\nthan 6.4% of all vesicant administrations). Regardless of the FDA\u2019s\nreasons for not contraindicating IV push for these drugs, it is odd\n(to say the least) that a jury in Vermont can now order for\nPhenergan what the FDA has chosen not to order for mustard\ngas.[Footnote\n18]*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*To be sure, state tort suits can peacefully\ncoexist with the FDA\u2019s labeling regime, and they have done so for\ndecades.Ante, at 17\u201318. But this case is far from\npeaceful coexistence. The FDA told Wyeth that Phenergan\u2019s label\nrenders its use \u201csafe.\u201d But the State of Vermont, through its tort\nlaw, said: \u201cNot so.\u201dThe state-law rule at issue here is squarely\npre-empted. Therefore, I would reverse the judgment of the Supreme\nCourt of Vermont.Appendix TO OPINION OF ALITO,\nJ.Vesicant1IV Push2DactinomycinSpecifically\nallowedMechlorethamine\n(Mustargen)Specifically\nallowedOxaliplatinSpecifically\nallowedVinblastineSpecifically\nallowedVincristineSpecifically\nallowedBleomycinNeither mentioned nor\nprohibitedCarboplatinNeither mentioned nor\nprohibitedDacarbazineNeither mentioned nor\nprohibitedMitomycinNeither mentioned nor\nprohibitedCarmustineNot prohibited; IV drip\nrecommendedCisplatinNot prohibited; IV drip\nrecommendedEpirubicinNot prohibited; IV drip\nrecommendedEtoposideNot prohibited; IV drip\nrecommendedIfosfamideNot prohibited; IV drip\nrecommendedMitoxantroneNot prohibited; IV drip\nrecommendedPaclitaxelNot prohibited; IV drip\nrecommendedTeniposideNot prohibited; IV drip\nrecommendedVinorelbineNot prohibited; IV drip\nrecommendedDaunorubicinProhibitedDoxorubicinProhibited1\u00a0Wilkes & Barton-Burke, 2008\nOncology Nursing Drug Handbook 27\u201333 (2008) (Table\n1.6).2\u00a0IV-push information is derived from\nthe \u201cdosage and administration\u201d sections of individual drug labels\n(available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case\nfile).Footnote\n1Indeed, respondent conceded below that Wyethdidpropose an adequate warning of Phenergan\u2019s risks.

The FDA required Wyeth to include\nHager and Wilson\u2019s observations on Phenergan\u2019s label. See App. 311\n(requiring the label to warn that \u201c\u00a0\u2018[t]he first sign [of an\nintra-arterial injection] may be the patient\u2019s reaction to a\nsensation of fiery burning\u2019\u00a0\u201d pain and\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018[b]lanching\u2019\u00a0\u201d).Footnote\n9See\nEnloe 427 (discussing hydroxyzine\u2014an antihistamine with chemical\nproperties similar to those of Phenergan\u2014and suggesting its\n\u201ctemporary\u201d benefits can never outweigh the risks of intra-arterial\ninjection); see also Goldsmith & Trieger, Accidental\nIntra-Arterial Injection: A Medical Emergency, 22 Anesthesia\nProgress 180 (1975) (noting the risks of intra-arterial\nadministration of hydroxyzine) (cited in App. 315, no.\u00a018);\nKlatte, Brooks, & Rhamy, Toxicity of Intra-Arterial Barbituates\nand Tranquilizing Drugs, 92 Radiology 700 (1969) (same) (cited in\nApp. 314, no.\u00a013). With full knowledge of those risks, FDA\nretained IV push for Phenergan, although the agency required Wyeth\nto incorporate observations from the Enloe article into Phenergan\u2019s\nlabel. Compare Enloe 427 (arguing that \u201cevery precaution should be\ntaken to avoid inadvertent intra-arterial injection,\u201d including the\nuse of \u201can obviously well-functioning venoclysis\u201d), with App. 312\n(FDA\u2019s 1987 changes to Phenergan\u2019s label). In contrast, at some\ntime around 1970, the FDA prohibited all intravenous use of\nhydroxyzine. Seeid., at 79 (testimony of Dr. Harold\nGreen). The FDA\u2019s decision to regulate the two drugs\ndifferently\u2014notwithstanding (1) the agency\u2019s knowledge of the risks\nassociated with both drugs and (2) the agency\u2019s recognition of the\nrelevance of hydroxyzine-related articles and case reports in its\nregulation of Phenergan\u2014further demonstrates that the FDA\nintentionally preserved IV-push administration for Phenergan. See\nalso Haas, Correspondence, 33 Anesthesia Progress 281 (1986)\n(\u201c[Hydroxyzine\u2019s] restriction does not lie with the medicine\nitself, but in the practice and malpractice of intravenous\ntechniques. Unfortunately, the practitioner who knows how to treat\ninjection technique problems is usually not the practitioner with\nthe intravenous technique\nproblems\u201d).Footnote\n10See\nalso Engler, Freeman, Kanavage, Ogden, & Moretz, Production of\nGangrenous Extremities by Intra-Arterial Injections, 30 Am. Surgeon\n602 (1964) (\u201cAccidental arterial injection most often occurs in the\nantecubital region because this is a favorite site for venopuncture\nand in this area the ulnar and brachial arteries are superficial\nand easily entered\u201d (cited in App. 313, no. 6)); Engler, Gangrenous\nExtremities Resulting from Intra-arterial Injections, 94 Archives\nof Surgery 644 (1966) (similar) (cited in App. 314, no. 16); Lynas\n& Bisset, Intra-arterial Thiopentone, 24 Anaesthesia 257 (1969)\n(\u201cMost [anesthesiologists] agree that injections on the medial\naspect of the antecubital fossa are best avoided\u201d (cited in App.\n314, no. 8)); Waters, Intra-arterial Thiopentone, 21 Anesthesia 346\n(1966) (\u201cThe risk of producing gangrene of the forearm by\naccidental injection of sodium thiopentone into an artery at the\nelbow has been recognised for many years\u201d (cited in App. 314, no.\n10)); see also Hager & Wilson, 94 Archives of Surgery, at 88\n(emphasizing that one of the best ways to prevent inadvertent\nintra-arterial injections is to be aware of \u201caberrant or\nsuperficial arteries at the antecubital, forearm, wrist, and hand\nlevel\u201d); Mostafavi & Samimi,supra(warning against\nantecubital\ninjections).Footnote\n11See\nApp. 311 (requiring Phenergan\u2019s label to warn that practitioners\nshould \u201c\u00a0\u2018[b]eware of the close proximity of arteries and\nveins at commonly used injection sites and consider the possibility\nof aberrant\narteries\u2019\u00a0\u201d).Footnote\n12\u201cAspiration\u201d refers to drawing a small amount of blood\nback into the needle to determine whether the needle is in an\nartery or a vein. Ordinarily, arterial blood is brighter than\nvenous blood\u2014but contact with Phenergan causes discoloration, which\nmakes aspiration an unreliable method of protecting against\nintra-arterial injection. Seeid., at 282. Therefore, the\nlabel warned that when using IV push, a medical professional should\nbeware that \u201c[a]spiration of dark blood does not preclude\nintra-arterial needle placement, because blood is discolored upon\ncontact with Phenergan Injection.\u201dId., at\n390.Footnote\n13In\naddition, respondent\u2019s own medical expert testified at trial that\nit is a principle of \u201cbasic anatomy\u201d that the antecubital fossa\ncontains aberrant arteries. See 2 Tr. 34\u201335 (Mar. 9, 2004)\n(testimony of Dr. Daniel O\u2019Brien); see alsoibid.(noting\nthat Gray\u2019s Anatomy, which is \u201cthe Bible of anatomy,\u201d also warns of\narteries in the antecubital\nspace).Footnote\n14Thus, it is not true that \u201cthis Court has long\u201d applied a\npresumption against pre-emption in conflict pre-emption cases.Ante, at 9, n.\u00a03 (majority opinion). As long ago asGibbonsv.Ogden,9 Wheat. 1, 210 (1824), the\nCourt inquired whether a state law \u201cinterfer[ed] with,\u201d was\n\u201ccontrary to,\u201d or \u201cc[a]me into collision with\u201d federal law\u2014and it\ndid so without ever invoking a \u201cpresumption.\u201d See also Davis,\nUnmasking the Presumption in Favor of Preemption, 53 S.\u00a0C.\nL.\u00a0Rev. 967, 974 (2002) (noting that many of the Court\u2019s early\npre-emption cases \u201cresulted in almost automatic preemption of\nconcurrent state regulation\u201d). In subsequent years the Court has\nsometimes acknowledged a limited \u201cpresumption against pre-emption,\u201d\nbut it nonetheless remained an open question\u2014before today\u2014whether\nthat presumption applied in conflict pre-emption cases. SeeCrosbyv.National Foreign Trade Council,530 U. S. 363,\n374, n.\u00a08 (2000) (\u201cWe leave for another day a consideration in\nthis context of a presumption against preemption\u201d). Moreover, this\nCourt has never held that the \u201cpresumption\u201d applies in an area\u2014such\nas drug labeling\u2014that has long been \u201creserved for federal\nregulation.\u201dUnited Statesv.Locke,529 U.
