Because there is no evidence that Missouri designed its\nprotocol to inflict pain on anyone, let alone Russell Bucklew, I\nwould end the inquiry there. Nonetheless, I join the Court\u2019s\nopinion in full because it correctly explains why Bucklew\u2019s claim\nfails even under the Court\u2019s precedents.I write separately to explain why Justice\nBreyer\u2019s dissenting opinion does not cast doubt on this standard.Post, at 15\u201316. As I explained inBaze, \u201cthe evil the\nEighth Amendment targets is intentional infliction of gratuitous\npain.\u201d 553 U.\u00a0S., at 102 (opinion concurring in judgment). The\nhistorical evidence shows that the Framers sought to disable\nCongress from imposing various kinds of torturous punishments, such\nas \u201c\u00a0\u2018gibbeting,\u2019\u00a0\u201d \u201cburning at the stake,\u201d and\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018embowelling alive, beheading, and quartering.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId., at 95\u201398 (quoting 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *376\n(Blackstone), and S. Banner, The Death Penalty: An American History\n71\u201372 (2002)). In England, these aggravated forms of capital\npunishment were \u201c\u00a0\u2018superadded\u2019\u00a0\u201d to increase terror and\ndisgrace for \u201c\u00a0\u2018very atrocious crimes,\u2019\u00a0\u201d such as treason\nand murder. SeeBaze,supra, at 96\u201397 (quoting 4\nBlackstone *376). The founding generation ratified the Eighth\nAmendment to reject that practice, contemplating that capital\npunishment would continue, but without those punishments\ndeliberately designed to superadd pain. SeeBaze, 553\nU.\u00a0S., at 97\u201398. Under this view, the constitutionality of a\nparticular execution thus turns on whether the Government\n\u201cdeliberately designed\u201d the method of execution \u201cto inflict pain,\u201did.,at 94, without regard to the subjective intent of the\nexecutioner.Contrary to Justice Breyer\u2019s suggestion, my view\ndoes not render the Eighth Amendment \u201ca static prohibition\u201d\nproscribing only \u201cthe same things that it proscribed in the 18th\ncentury.\u201dPost,at 15\u201316. A method of execution not\nspecifically contemplated at the founding could today be imposed to\n\u201csuperad[d]\u201d \u201cterror, pain, or disgrace.\u201d 4 Blackstone *376.\nThankfully\u2014and consistent with Justice Story\u2019s view that the Eighth\nAmendment is \u201cwholly unnecessary in a free government,\u201d 3 J. Story,\nCommentaries on the Constitution of the United States 750\n(1833)\u2014States do not attempt to devise such diabolical punishments.E.g.,Baze,supra, at 107 (\u201cKentucky adopted\nits lethal injection protocol in an effort to make capital\npunishment more humane\u201d). It is therefore unsurprising that,\ndespite Justice Breyer\u2019s qualms about the death pen- alty,e.g.,post, at 18, this Court has never held a method\nof execution unconstitutional. Because the Court correctly declines\nto do so again today, I join in full.",
