ALLCARE HEALTH\nMANAGEMENT SYSTEM, INC.on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the federal circuit[April 29, 2014]Justice Sotomayor\ndelivered the opinion of the Court.Section 285 of the\nPatent Act provides: \u201cThe court in exceptional cases may award\nreasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party.\u201d 35\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7285. In Brooks Furniture Mfg., Inc. v.\nDutailier Int\u2019l, Inc., 393 F.\u00a03d 1378 (2005), the United\nStates Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit interpreted \u00a7285 as\nauthorizing fee awards only in two circumstances. It held that \u201c[a]\ncase may be deemed exceptional\u201d under \u00a7285 \u201cwhen there has been\nsome material inappropriate conduct,\u201d or when it is both \u201cbrought\nin subjective bad faith\u201d and \u201cobjectively baseless.\u201d Id., at 1381.\nWe granted certiorari to determine whether an appellate court\nshould accord deference to a district court\u2019s determination that\nlitigation is \u201cobjectively baseless.\u201d On the basis of our opinion\nin Octane Fitness, LLC v. ICON Health & Fitness, Inc., ante, p.\n___, argued together with this case and also issued today, we hold\nthat an appellate court should review all aspects of a district\ncourt\u2019s \u00a7285 determination for abuse of discretion.IAllcare Health\nManagement System, Inc., owns U.\u00a0S. Patent No. 5,301,105 (\u2019105\npatent), which covers \u201cutilization review\u201d in \u201c\u00a0\u2018managed\nhealth care systems.\u2019\u00a0\u201d[1]\n687 F.\u00a03d 1300, 1306 (CA Fed 2012). Highmark Inc., a health\ninsurance company, sued Allcare seeking a declaratory judgment that\nthe \u2019105 patent was invalid and unenforceable and that, to the\nextent it was valid, Highmark\u2019s actions were not infringing it.\nAllcare counterclaimed for patent infringement. Both parties filed\nmotions for summary judgment, and the District Court entered a\nfinal judgment of noninfringement in favor of Highmark. The Federal\nCircuit affirmed. 329 Fed. Appx. 280 (2009) (per curiam).Highmark then moved for\nfees under \u00a7285. The District Court granted Highmark\u2019s motion. 706\nF.\u00a0Supp. 2d 713 (ND Tex. 2010). The court reasoned that\nAllcare had engaged in a pattern of \u201cvexatious\u201d and \u201cdeceitful\u201d\nconduct throughout the litigation. Id., at 737. Specifically, it\nfound that Allcare had \u201cpursued this suit as part of a bigger plan\nto identify companies potentially infringing the \u2019105 patent under\nthe guise of an informational survey, and then to force those\ncompanies to purchase a license of the \u2019105 patent under threat of\nlitigation.\u201d Id., at 736\u2013737. And it found that Allcare had\n\u201cmaintained infringement claims [against Highmark] well after such\nclaims had been shown by its own experts to be without merit\u201d and\nhad \u201casserted defenses it and its attorneys knew to be frivolous.\u201d\nId., at 737. In a subsequent opinion, the District Court fixed the\namount of the award at $4,694,727.40 in attorney\u2019s fees and\n$209,626.56 in expenses, in addition to $375,400.05 in expert fees.\n2010 WL 6432945, *7 (ND Tex., Nov. 5, 2010).The Federal Circuit\naffirmed in part and reversed in part. 687 F.\u00a03d 1300. It\naffirmed the District Court\u2019s exceptional-case determination with\nrespect to the allegations that Highmark\u2019s system infringed one\nclaim of the \u2019105 patent, id., at 1311\u20131313, but reversed the\ndetermination with respect to another claim of the patent, id., at\n1313\u20131315. In reversing the exceptional-case determination as to\none claim, the court reviewed it de\u00a0novo. The court held that\nbecause the question whether litigation is \u201cobjectively baseless\u201d\nunder Brooks Furniture \u201c\u00a0\u2018is a question of law based on\nunderlying mixed questions of law and fact,\u2019\u00a0\u201d an\nobjective-baselessness determination is reviewed on appeal\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018de\u00a0novo\u2019\u00a0\u201d and \u201cwithout deference.\u201d 687\nF.\u00a03d, at 1309; see also ibid., n.\u00a01. It then determined,\ncontrary to the judgment of the District Court, that \u201cAllcare\u2019s\nargument\u201d as to claim construction \u201cwas not \u2018so unreasonable that\nno reasonable litigant could believe it would succeed.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Id.,\nat 1315. The court further found that none of Allcare\u2019s conduct\nwarranted an award of fees under the litigation-misconduct prong of\nBrooks Furniture. 687 F.\u00a03d, at 1315\u20131319.Judge Mayer dissented\nin part, disagreeing with the view \u201cthat no deference is owed to a\ndistrict court\u2019s finding that the infringement claims asserted by a\nlitigant at trial were objectively unreasonable.\u201d Id., at 1319. He\nwould have held that \u201creasonableness is a finding of fact which may\nbe set aside only for clear error.\u201d Ibid. The Federal Circuit\ndenied rehearing en banc, over the dissent of five judges. 701\nF.\u00a03d 1351 (2012). The dissenting judges criticized the\ncourt\u2019s decision to adopt a de\u00a0novo standard of review for the\n\u201cobjectively baseless\u201d determination as an impermissible invasion\nof the province of the district court. Id., at 1357.We granted certiorari,\n570 U. S. ___ (2013), and now vacate and remand.IIOur opinion in Octane\nFitness, LLC v. ICON Health & Fitness, Inc., rejects the Brooks\nFurniture framework as unduly rigid and inconsistent with the text\nof \u00a7285. It holds, instead, that the word \u201cexceptional\u201d in \u00a7285\nshould be interpreted in accordance with its ordinary meaning.\nAnte, at 7. An \u201cexceptional\u201d case, it explains, \u201cis simply one that\nstands out from others with respect to the substantive strength of\na party\u2019s litigating position (considering both the governing law\nand the facts of the case) or the unreasonable manner in which the\ncase was litigated.\u201d Ante, at 7\u20138. And it instructs that\n\u201c[d]istrict courts may determine whether a case is \u2018exceptional\u2019 in\nthe case-by-case exercise of their discretion, considering the\ntotality of the circumstances.\u201d Ante, at 8. Our holding in Octane\nsettles this case: Because \u00a7285 commits the determination whether a\ncase is \u201cexceptional\u201d to the discretion of the district court, that\ndecision is to be reviewed on appeal for abuse of discretion.Traditionally,\ndecisions on \u201cquestions of law\u201d are \u201creviewable de\u00a0novo,\u201d\ndecisions on \u201cquestions of fact\u201d are \u201creviewable for clear error,\u201d\nand decisions on \u201cmatters of discretion\u201d are \u201creviewable for \u2018abuse\nof discretion.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Pierce v. Underwood, 487 U.\u00a0S. 552, 558\n(1988) . For reasons we explain in Octane, the determination\nwhether a case is \u201cexceptional\u201d under \u00a7285 is a matter of\ndiscretion. And as in our prior cases involving similar\ndeterminations, the exceptional-case determination is to be\nreviewed only for abuse of discretion.[2] See Pierce, 487 U.\u00a0S., at 559 (determinations\nwhether a litigating position is \u201csubstan-tially justified\u201d for\npurposes of fee-shifting under the Equal Access to Justice Act are\nto be reviewed for abuse of discretion); Cooter & Gell v.\nHartmarx Corp., 496 U. S. 384, 405 (1990) (sanctions under Federal\nRule of Civil Procedure 11 are to be reviewed for abuse of\ndiscretion).As in Pierce, the text\nof the statute \u201cemphasizes the fact that the determination is for\nthe district court,\u201d which \u201csuggests some deference to the district\ncourt upon appeal,\u201d 487 U.\u00a0S., at 559. As in Pierce, \u201cas a\nmatter of the sound administration of justice,\u201d the district court\n\u201cis better positioned\u201d to decide whether a case is exceptional,\nid., at 559\u2013560, because it lives with the case over a prolonged\nperiod of time. And as in Pierce, the question is \u201cmultifarious and\nnovel,\u201d not susceptible to \u201cuseful generalization\u201d of the sort that\nde\u00a0novo review provides, and \u201clikely to profit from the\nexperience that an abuse-of-discretion rule will permit to\ndevelop,\u201d id., at 562.We therefore hold that\nan appellate court should apply an abuse-of-discretion standard in\nreviewing all aspects of a district court\u2019s \u00a7285 determination.\nAlthough questions of law may in some cases be relevant to the \u00a7285\ninquiry, that inquiry generally is, at heart, \u201crooted in factual\ndeterminations,\u201d Cooter, 496 U.\u00a0S., at 401.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*The judgment of the\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit is vacated,\nand the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with\nthis opinion.It is so ordered.Notes1\u201c\u00a0\u2018Utilization\nreview\u2019 is the process of determining whether a health insurer\nshould approve a particular treatment for a patient.\u201d 687\nF.\u00a03d, at 1306.2The abuse-of-discretion\nstandard does not preclude an appellate court\u2019s correction of a\ndistrict court\u2019s legal or factual error: \u201cA district court would\nnecessarily abuse its discretion if it based its ruling on an\nerroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of\nthe evidence.\u201d v. , .",
