MURR, et\u00a0al., PETITIONERSv.WISCONSIN, et\u00a0al.on writ of certiorari to the court of appeals\nof wisconsin, district iii[June 23, 2017]Chief Justice Roberts, with whom Justice\nThomas and Justice Alito join, dissenting.The Murr family owns two adjacent lots along the\nLower St. Croix River. Under a local regulation, those two\nproperties may not be \u201csold or developed as separate lots\u201d because\nneither contains a sufficiently large area of buildable land. Wis.\nAdmin. Code \u00a7NR\u00a0118.08(4)(a)(2) (2017). The Court today holds\nthat the regulation does not effect a taking that requires just\ncompensation. This bottom-line conclusion does not trouble me; the\nmajority presents a fair case that the Murrs can still make good\nuse of both lots, and that the ordinance is a commonplace tool to\npreserve scenic areas, such as the Lower St. Croix River, for the\nbenefit of landowners and the public alike.Where the majority goes astray, however, is in\nconcluding that the definition of the \u201cprivate property\u201d at issue\nin a case such as this turns on an elaborate test looking not only\nto state and local law, but also to (1) \u201cthe physical\ncharacteristics of the land,\u201d (2) \u201cthe prospective value of the\nregulated land,\u201d (3) the \u201creasonable expectations\u201d of the owner,\nand (4)\u00a0\u201cbackground customs and the whole of our legal\ntradition.\u201dAnte,at 11\u201312. Our decisions have, time and\nagain, declared that the Takings Clause protects private property\nrights as state law creates and defines them. By securing suchestablishedproperty rights, the Takings Clause protects\nindividuals from being forced to bear the full weight of actions\nthat should be borne by the public at large. The majority\u2019s new,\nmalleable definition of \u201cprivate property\u201d\u2014adopted solely \u201cfor\npurposes of th[e] takings inquiry,\u201dante,at 20\u2014undermines\nthat protection.I would stick with our traditional approach:\nState law defines the boundaries of distinct parcels of land, and\nthose boundaries should determine the \u201cprivate property\u201d at issue\nin regulatory takings cases. Whether a regulation effects a taking\nof that property is a separate question, one in which common\nownership of adjacent property may be taken into account. Because\nthe majority departs from these settled principles, I respectfully\ndissent.IAThe Takings Clause places a condition on the\ngovernment\u2019s power to interfere with property rights, instructing\nthat \u201cprivate property [shall not] be taken for public use, without\njust compensation.\u201d Textually and logically, this Clause raises\nthree basic questions that individuals, governments, and judges\nmust consider when anticipating or deciding whether the government\nwill have to provide reimbursement for its actions. The first is\nwhat \u201cpri-vate property\u201d the government\u2019s planned course of conduct\nwill affect. The second, whether that property has been \u201ctaken\u201d for\n\u201cpublic use.\u201d And if \u201cprivate property\u201d has been \u201ctaken,\u201d the last\nitem of business is to calculate the \u201cjust compensation\u201d the owner\nis due.Step one\u2014identifying the property interest at\nstake\u2014requires looking outside the Constitution. The word\n\u201cproperty\u201d in the Takings Clause means \u201cthe group of rights\ninhering in [a] citizen\u2019s relation to [a] .\u00a0.\u00a0. thing, as\nthe right to possess, use and dispose of it.\u201dUnited Statesv.General Motors Corp., 323 U.\u00a0S. 373, 378 (1945) .\nThe Clause does not, however, provide the definition of those\nrights in any particular case. Instead, \u201cproperty interests\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. are created and their dimensions are defined by\nexisting rules or understandings that stem from an independent\nsource such as state law.\u201dRuckelshausv.Monsanto\nCo., 467 U.\u00a0S. 986, 1001 (1984) (alteration and internal\nquotation marks omitted). By protecting these established rights,\nthe Takings Clause stands as a buffer between property owners and\ngovernments, which might naturally look to put private property to\nwork for the public at large.When government action interferes with property\nrights, the next question becomes whether that interference amounts\nto a \u201ctaking.\u201d \u201cThe paradigmatic taking .\u00a0.\u00a0. is a direct\ngovernment appropriation or physical invasion of private property.\u201dLinglev.Chevron U.\u00a0S.\u00a0A. Inc., 544\nU.\u00a0S. 528, 537 (2005) . These types of actions give rise to\n\u201cper setaking[s]\u201d because they are \u201cperhaps the most\nserious form[s] of invasion of an owner\u2019s property interests,\ndepriving the owner of the rights to possess, use and dispose of\nthe property.\u201dHornev.Department of Agriculture,\n576 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2015) (slip op., at 7) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).But not all takings are so direct: Governments\ncan infringe private property interests for public use not only\nthrough appropriations, but through regulations as well. If\ncompensation were required for one but not the other, \u201cthe natural\ntendency of human nature\u201d would be to extend regulations \u201cuntil at\nlast private property disappears.\u201dPennsylvania Coal Co.v.Mahon, 260 U.\u00a0S. 393, 415 (1922) . Our regulatory\ntakings decisions, then, have recognized that, \u201cwhile property may\nbe regulated to a certain extent, if regulation goes too far it\nwill be recognized as a taking.\u201dIbid.This rule strikes a\nbalance between property owners\u2019 rights and the government\u2019s\nauthority to advance the common good. Owners can rest assured that\nthey will be compensated for particularly onerous regulatory\nactions, while governments maintain the freedom to adjust the\nbenefits and burdens of property ownership without incurring\ncrippling costs from each alteration.Depending, of course, on how far is \u201ctoo far.\u201d\nWe have said often enough that the answer to this question\ngenerally resistsper serules and rigid formulas. There\nare, however, a few fixed principles: The inquiry \u201cmust be\nconducted with respect to specific property.\u201dKeystone\nBituminous Coal Assn.v.DeBenedictis, 480 U.\u00a0S.\n470, 495 (1987) (internal quotation marks omitted). And if a\n\u201cregulation denies all economically beneficial or productive use of\nland,\u201d the interference categorically amounts to a taking.Lucasv.South Carolina Coastal Council, 505\nU.\u00a0S. 1003, 1015 (1992) . For the vast array of regulations\nthat lack such an extreme effect, a flexible approach is more\nfitting. The factors to consider are wide ranging, and include the\neconomic impact of the regulation, the owner\u2019s investment-backed\nexpectations, and the character of the government action. The\nultimate question is whether the government\u2019s imposition on a\nproperty has forced the owner \u201cto bear public burdens which, in all\nfairness and justice, should be borne by the public as a whole.\u201dPenn Central Transp. Co.v.New York City, 438\nU.\u00a0S. 104, 123 (1978) (internal quotation marks omitted).Finally, if a taking has occurred, the remaining\nmatter is tabulating the \u201cjust compensation\u201d to which the property\nowner is entitled. \u201c[J]ust compensation normally is tobe measured\nby the market value of the property at the time of the taking.\u201dHorne, 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 15) (internal\nquotation marks omitted).BBecause a regulation amounts to a taking if it\ncompletely destroys a property\u2019s productive use, there is an\nincen-tive for owners to define the relevant \u201cprivate property\u201d\nnarrowly. This incentive threatens the careful balance between\nproperty rights and government authority that our regulatory\ntakings doctrine strikes: Put in terms of the familiar \u201cbundle\u201d\nanalogy, each \u201cstrand\u201d in the bundle of rights that comes along\nwith owning real property is a distinct property interest. If\nowners could define the relevant \u201cprivate property\u201d at issue as the\nspecific \u201cstrand\u201d that the challenged regulation affects, they\ncould convert nearly all regulations intoper\u00a0setakings.And so we do not allow it. InPenn Central\nTransportation Co.v.New York City, we held that\nproperty owners may not \u201cestablish a \u2018taking\u2019 simply by showing\nthat they have been denied the ability to exploit a property\ninterest.\u201d 438 U.\u00a0S., at 130. In that case, the owner of Grand\nCentral Terminal in New York City argued that a restriction on the\nowner\u2019s ability to add an office building atop the station amounted\nto a taking of its air rights. We rejected that narrow definition\nof the \u201cproperty\u201d at issue, concluding that the correct unit of\nanalysis was the owner\u2019s \u201crights in the parcel as a whole.\u201dId.,at 130\u2013131. \u201c[W]here an owner possesses a full \u2018bundle\u2019\nof property rights, the destruction of one strand of the bundle is\nnot a taking, because the aggregate must be viewed in its\nentirety.\u201dAndrusv.Allard, 444 U.\u00a0S. 51 \u201366\n(1979); seeTahoe-Sierra Preservation Council, Inc.v.Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, 535 U.\u00a0S. 302, 327\n(2002) .The question presented in today\u2019s case concerns\nthe \u201cparcel as a whole\u201d language fromPenn Central. This\nenigmatic phrase has created confusion about how to identify the\nrelevant property in a regulatory takings case when the claimant\nowns more than one plot of land. Should the impact of the\nregulation be evaluated with respect to each individual plot, or\nwith respect to adjacent plots grouped together as one unit?\nAccording to the majority, a court should answer this question by\nconsidering a number of facts about the land and the regulation at\nissue. The end result turns on whether those factors \u201cwould lead a\nlandowner to anticipate that his holdings would be treated as one\nparcel, or, instead, as separate tracts.\u201dAnte,at 12.I think the answer is far more straightforward:\nState laws define the boundaries of distinct units of land, and\nthose boundaries should, in all but the most exceptional\ncircumstances, determine the parcel at issue. Even in regulatory\ntakings cases, the first step of the Takings Clause analysis is\nstill to identify the relevant \u201cprivate property.\u201d States create\nproperty rights with respect to particular \u201cthings.\u201d And in the\ncontext of real property, those \u201cthings\u201d are horizontally bounded\nplots of land.Tahoe-Sierra, 535 U.\u00a0S., at 331 (\u201cAn\ninterest in real property is defined by the metes and bounds that\ndescribe its geographic dimensions\u201d). States may define those plots\ndifferently\u2014some using metes and bounds, others using government\nsurveys, recorded plats, or subdivision maps. See 11 D. Thomas,\nThompson on Real Property \u00a794.07(s) (2d ed. 2002); Powell on Real\nProperty \u00a781A.05(2)(a) (M. Wolf ed. 2016). But the definition of\nproperty draws the basic line between, as P.\u00a0G. Wodehouse\nwould put it,meumandtuum. The question of who owns\nwhat is pretty important: The rules must provide a readily\nascertainable definition of the land to which a particular bundle\nof rights attaches that does not vary depending upon the purpose at\nissue. See,e.g.,Wis. Stat. \u00a7236.28 (2016) (\u201c[T]he lots in\n[a] plat shall be described by the name of the plat and the lot and\nblock .\u00a0.\u00a0. for all purposes, including those of\nassessment, taxation, devise, descent and conveyance\u201d).Following state property lines is also entirely\nconsistent withPenn Central. Requiring consideration of the\n\u201cparcel as a whole\u201d is a response to the risk that owners will\nstrategically pluck one strand from their bundle of property\nrights\u2014such as the air rights at issue inPenn Central\u2014and\nclaim a complete taking based on that strand alone. That risk of\nstrategic unbundling is not present when a legally distinct parcel\nis the basis of the regulatory takings claim. State law defines all\nof the interests that come along with owning a particular parcel,\nand both property owners and the government must take those rights\nas they find them.The majority envisions that relying on state law\nwill create other opportunities for \u201cgamesmanship\u201d by landowners\nand States: The former, it contends, \u201cmight seek to alter [lot]\nlines in anticipation of regulation,\u201d while the latter might pass a\nlaw that \u201cconsolidates .\u00a0.\u00a0. property\u201d to avoid a\nsuccessful takings claim.Ante,at 11, 17. But such obvious\nattempts to alter the legal landscape in anticipation of a lawsuit\nare unlikely and not particularly difficult to detect and disarm.\nWe rejected the strategic splitting of property rights inPenn\nCentral, and courts could do the same if faced with an attempt\nto create a takings-specific definition of \u201cprivate property.\u201d Cf.Phillipsv.Washington Legal Foundation, 524\nU.\u00a0S. 156, 167 (1998) (\u201c[A] State may not sidestep the Takings\nClause by disavowing traditional property interests long recognized\nunder state law\u201d).Once the relevant property is identified, the\nreal work begins. To decide whether the regulation at issue amounts\nto a \u201ctaking,\u201d courts should focus on the effect of the regulation\non the \u201cprivate property\u201d at issue. Adjacent land under common\nownership may be relevant to that inquiry. The owner\u2019s possession\nof such a nearby lot could, for instance, shed light on how the\nowner reasonably expected to use the parcel at issue before the\nregulation. If the court concludes that the government\u2019s action\namounts to a taking, principles of \u201cjust compensation\u201d may also\nallow the owner to recover damages \u201cwith regard to a separate\nparcel\u201d that is contiguous and used in conjunction with the parcel\nat issue. 4A L. Smith & M. Hansen, Nichols\u2019 Law of Eminent\nDomain, ch. 14B, \u00a714B.02 (rev. 3d ed. 2010).In sum, the \u201cparcel as a whole\u201d requirement\nprevents a property owner from identifying a single \u201cstrand\u201d in his\nbundle of property rights and claiming that interest has been\ntaken. Allowing that strategic approach to defining \u201cprivate\nproperty\u201d would undermine the balance struck by our regulatory\ntakings cases. Instead, state law creates distinct parcels of land\nand defines the rights that come along with owning those parcels.\nThose established bundles of rights should define the \u201cprivate\nproperty\u201d in regulatory takings cases. While ownership of\ncontiguous properties may bear on whether a person\u2019s plot has been\n\u201ctaken,\u201dPenn Centralprovides no basis for disregarding\nstate property lines when identifying the \u201cparcel as a whole.\u201dIIThe lesson that the majority draws fromPenn Centralis that defining \u201cthe proper parcel in\nregulatory takings cases cannot be solved by any simple test.\u201dAnte,at 20. Following through on that stand against\nsimplicity, the majority lists a complex set of factors\ntheoretically designed to reveal whether a hypothetical landowner\nmight expect that his property \u201cwould be treated as one parcel, or,\ninstead, as separate tracts.\u201dAnte,at 11. Those factors,\nsays the majority, show that Lots E and F of the Murrs\u2019 property\nconstitute a single parcel and that the local ordinance requiring\nthe Murrs to develop and sell those lots as a pair does not\nconstitute a taking.In deciding that Lots E and F are a single\nparcel, the majority focuses on the importance of the ordinance at\nissue and the extent to which the Murrs may have been especially\nsurprised, or unduly harmed, by the application of that ordinance\nto their property. But these issues should be considered when\ndeciding if a regulation constitutes a \u201ctaking.\u201d Cramming them into\nthe definition of \u201cprivate property\u201d undermines the effectiveness\nof the Takings Clause as a check on the government\u2019s power to shift\nthe cost of public life onto private individuals.The problem begins when the majority loses track\nof the basic structure of claims under the Takings Clause. While it\nis true that we have referred to regulatory takings claims as\ninvolving \u201cessentially ad hoc, factual inquiries,\u201d we have\nconducted those wide-ranging investigations when assessing \u201cthe\nquestion of what constitutes a \u2018taking\u2019\u00a0\u201d underPenn\nCentral.Ruckelshaus, 467 U.\u00a0S., at 1004 (emphasis\nadded); seeTahoe-Sierra, 535 U.\u00a0S., at 326 (\u201c[W]e have\ngenerally eschewed any set formula for determininghow far is\ntoo far\u201d (emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted)).\nAnd even then, we reach that \u201cad hoc\u201dPenn Centralframework\nonly after determining that the regulation did not deny all\nproductive use of the parcel. SeeTahoe-Sierra, 535\nU.\u00a0S., at 331. Both of these inquiries presuppose that the\nrelevant \u201cprivate property\u201d has already been identified. SeeHodelv.Virginia Surface Mining & Reclamation Assn.,\nInc., 452 U.\u00a0S. 264, 295 (1981) (explaining that \u201c[t]hese\n\u2018ad\u00a0hoc, factual inquiries\u2019 must be conducted with respect to\nspecific property\u201d). There is a simple reason why the majority does\nnot cite a single instance in which we have made that\nidentification by relying on anything other than state property\nprinciples\u2014we have never done so.In departing from state property principles, the\nmajority authorizes governments to do precisely what we rejected inPenn Central: create a litigation-specific definition of\n\u201cproperty\u201d designed for a claim under the Takings Clause. Whenever\npossible, governments in regulatory takings cases will ask courts\nto aggregate legally distinct properties into one \u201cparcel,\u201d solely\nfor purposes of resisting a particular claim. And under the\nmajority\u2019s test, identifying the \u201cparcel as a whole\u201d in such cases\nwill turn on the reasonableness of the regulation as applied to the\nclaimant. The result is that the government\u2019s regulatory interests\nwill come into play not once, but twice\u2014first when identifying the\nrelevant parcel, and again when determining whether the regulation\nhas placed too great a public burden on that property.Regulatory takings, however\u2014by their very\nnature\u2014pit the common good against the interests of a few. There is\nan inherent imbalance in that clash of interests. The widespread\nbenefits of a regulation will often appear far weightier than the\nisolated losses suffered by individuals. And looking at the bigger\npicture, the overall societal good of an economic system grounded\non private property will appear abstract when cast against a\nconcrete regulatory problem. In the face of this imbalance, the\nTakings Clause \u201cprevents the public from loading upon one\nindividual more than his just share of the burdens of government,\u201dMonongahela Nav. Co.v.United States, 148 U.\u00a0S.\n312, 325 (1893) , by considering the effect of a regulation on\nspecific property rights as they are established at state law. But\nthe majority\u2019s approach undermines that protection, defining\nproperty only after engaging in an ad hoc, case-specific\nconsideration of individual and community interests. The result is\nthat the government\u2019s goals shape the playing field before the\ncontest over whether the challenged regulation goes \u201ctoo far\u201d even\ngets underway.Suppose, for example, that a person buys two\ndistinct plots of land\u2014known as Lots A and B\u2014from two different\nowners. Lot A is landlocked, but the neighboring Lot B shares a\nborder with a local beach. It soon comes to light, however, that\nthe beach is a nesting habitat for a species of turtle. To protect\nthis species, the state government passes a regulation preventing\nany development or recreation in areas abutting the beach\u2014including\nLot B. If that lot became the subject of a regulatory takings\nclaim, the purchaser would have a strong case for aper setaking: Even accounting for the owner\u2019s possession of the other\nproperty, Lot B had no remaining economic value or productive use.\nBut under the majority\u2019s approach, the government can argue\nthat\u2014based on all the circumstances and the nature of the\nregulation\u2014Lots A and B should be considered one \u201cparcel.\u201d If that\nargument succeeds, the owner\u2019sper setakings claim is gone,\nand he is left to roll the dice under thePenn Centralbalancing framework, where the court will, for a second time, throw\nthe reason-ableness of the government\u2019s regulatory action into the\nbalance.The majority assures that, under its test,\n\u201c[d]efining the property .\u00a0.\u00a0. should notnecessarilypreordain the outcome ineverycase.\u201dAnte,at 10 (emphasis added). The underscored language\ncheapens the assurance. The framework laid out today provides\nlittle guidance for identifying whether \u201cexpectations about\nproperty ownership would lead a landowner to anticipate that his\nholdings would be treated as one parcel, or, instead, as separate\ntracts.\u201dAnte,at 12. Instead, the majority\u2019s approach will\nlead to definitions of the \u201cparcel\u201d that have far more to do with\nthe reasonableness of applying the challenged regulation to a\nparticular landowner. The result is clear double counting to tip\nthe scales in favor of the government: Reasonable government\nregulation should have been anticipated by the landowner, so the\nrelevant parcel is defined consistent with that regulation. In\ndeciding whether there is a taking under the second step of the\nanalysis, the regulation will seem eminently reasonable given its\nimpact on the pre-packaged parcel. Not, as the Court assures us,\n\u201cnecessarily\u201d in \u201cevery\u201d case, but surely in most.Moreover, given its focus on the particular\nchallenged regulation, the majority\u2019s approach must mean that two\nlots might be a single \u201cparcel\u201d for one takings claim, but separate\n\u201cparcels\u201d for another. Seeante,at 13. This is just another\nopportunity to gerrymander the definition of \u201cprivate property\u201d to\ndefeat a takings claim. The majority also emphasizes that courts\ntrying to identify the relevant parcel \u201cmust strive\u201d to ensure that\n\u201csome people alone [do not] bear public burdens which, in all\nfairness and justice, should be borne by the public as a whole.\u201dAnte,at 20 (internal quotation marks omitted). But this\nrefrain is the traditional touchstone for spotting a taking, not\nfor defining private property.Put simply, today\u2019s decision knocks the\ndefinition of \u201cprivate property\u201d loose from its foundation on\nstable state law rules and throws it into the maelstrom of multiple\nfactors that come into play at the second step of the takings\nanalysis. The result: The majority\u2019s new framework compromises the\nTakings Clause as a barrier between individuals and the press of\nthe public interest.IIIStaying with a state law approach to defining\n\u201cprivate property\u201d would make our job in this case fairly easy. The\nMurr siblings acquired Lot F in 1994 and Lot E a year later. Once\nthe lots fell into common ownership, the challenged ordinance\nprevented them from being \u201csold or developed as separate lots\u201d\nbecause neither contained a sufficiently large area of buildable\nland. Wis. Admin. Code \u00a7NR\u00a0118.08(4)(a)(2). The Murrs argued\nthat the ordinance amounted to a taking of Lot E, but the State of\nWisconsin and St. Croix County proposed that both lots together\nshould count as the relevant \u201cparcel.\u201dThe trial court sided with the State and County,\nand the Wisconsin Court of Appeals affirmed. Rather than\nconsidering whether Lots E and F are separate parcels under\nWisconsin law, however, the Court of Appeals adopted a\ntakings-specific approach to defining the relevant parcel. See 2015\nWI App 13, 359 Wis. 2d 675, 859 N.\u00a0W. 2d 628 (unpublished\nopinion), App. to Pet. for Cert. A\u20139, \u00b617 (framing the issue as\n\u201cwhether contiguous property is analytically divisible for purposes\nof a regulatory takings claim\u201d). Relying on what it called a\n\u201cwell-established rule\u201d for \u201cregulatory takings cases,\u201d the court\nexplained \u201cthat contiguous property under common ownership is\nconsidered as a whole regardless of the number of parcels contained\ntherein.\u201dId.,at A\u201311, \u00b620. And because Lots E and F were\nside by side and owned by the Murrs, the case was straightforward:\nThe two lots were one \u201cparcel\u201d for the regulatory takings analysis.\nThe court therefore evaluated the effect of the ordinance on the\ntwo lots considered together.As I see it, the Wisconsin Court of Appeals was\nwrong to apply a takings-specific definition of the property at\nissue. Instead, the court should have asked whether, under general\nstate law principles, Lots E and F are legally distinct parcels of\nland. I would therefore vacate the judgment below and remand for\nthe court to identify the relevant property using ordinary\nprinciples of Wisconsin property law.After making that state law determination, the\nnext step would be to determine whether the challenged ordinance\namounts to a \u201ctaking.\u201d If Lot E is a legally distinct parcel under\nstate law, the Court of Appeals would have to perform the takings\nanalysis anew, but could still consider many of the issues the\nmajority finds important. The majority, for instance, notes that\nunder the ordinance the Murrs can use Lot E as \u201crecreational\nspace,\u201d as the \u201clocation of any improvements,\u201d and as a valuable\naddition to Lot F.Ante,at 18. These facts could be\nrelevant to whether the \u201cregulation denies all economically\nbeneficial or productive use\u201d of Lot E.Lucas, 505\nU.\u00a0S., at 1015. Similarly, the majority touts the benefits of\nthe ordinance and observes that the Murrs had little use for Lot E\nindependent of Lot F and could have predicted that Lot E would be\nregulated.Ante,at 18. These facts speak to \u201cthe economic\nimpact of the regulation,\u201d interference with \u201cinvestment-backed\nexpectations,\u201d and the \u201ccharacter of the governmental action\u201d\u2014all\nthings we traditionally consider in thePenn Centralanalysis. 438 U.\u00a0S., at 124.I would be careful, however, to confine these\nconsiderations to the question whether the regulation constitutes a\ntaking. As Alexander Hamilton explained, \u201cthe security of Property\u201d\nis one of the \u201cgreat object[s] of government.\u201d 1 Records of the\nFederal Convention of 1787, p. 302 (M. Farrand ed. 1911). The\nTakings Clause was adopted to ensure such security by protecting\nproperty rights as they exist under state law. Deciding whether a\nregulation has gone so far as to constitute a \u201ctaking\u201d of one of\nthose property rights is, properly enough, a fact-intensive task\nthat relies \u201cas much on the exercise of judgment as on the\napplication of logic.\u201dMacDonald, Sommer & Fratesv.Yolo County, 477 U.\u00a0S. 340, 349 (1986) (alterations and\ninternal quotation marks omitted). But basing the definition of\n\u201cproperty\u201d on a judgment call, too, allows the government\u2019s\ninterests to warp the private rights that the Takings Clause is\nsupposed to secure.I respectfully dissent.",
