MICHAEL CLARKE\net\u00a0al.on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the eleventh circuit[June 19, 2014]Justice Kagan\ndelivered the opinion of the Court.The Internal Revenue\nService (IRS or Service) has broad statutory authority to summon a\ntaxpayer to produce documents or give testimony relevant to\ndetermining tax liability. If the taxpayer fails to comply, the IRS\nmay petition a federal district court to enforce the summons. In an\nenforcement proceeding, the IRS must show that it issued the\nsummons in good faith.This case requires us\nto consider when a taxpayer, as part of such a proceeding, has a\nright to question IRS officials about their reasons for issuing a\nsummons. We hold, contrary to the Court of Appeals below, that a\nbare allegation of improper purpose does not entitle a taxpayer to\nexamine IRS officials. Rather, the taxpayer has a right to conduct\nthat examination when he points to specific facts or circumstances\nplausibly raising an inference of bad faith.ICongress has\n\u201cauthorized and required\u201d the IRS \u201cto make the\ninquiries, determinations, and assessments of all taxes\u201d the\nInternal Revenue Code imposes. 26 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a76201(a).\nAnd in support of that authority, Congress has granted the Service\nbroad latitude to issue summonses \u201c[f]or the purpose of\nascertaining the correctness of any return, making a return where\nnone has been made, determining the liability of any person for any\ninternal revenue tax\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0, or collecting any\nsuch liability.\u201d \u00a77602(a). Such a summons directs a\ntaxpayer (or associated person[1]) to appear before an IRS official and to provide sworn\ntestimony or produce \u201cbooks, papers, records, or other data\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. relevant or material to [a tax] inquiry.\u201d\n\u00a77602(a)(1).If a taxpayer does not\ncomply with a summons, the IRS may bring an enforcement action in\ndistrict court. See \u00a7\u00a77402(b), 7604(a). In that\nproceeding, we have held, the IRS \u201cneed only demonstrate good\nfaith in issuing the summons.\u201d United States v. Stuart, 489\nU. S. 353, 359 (1989) . More specifically, that means establishing\nwhat have become known as the Powell factors: \u201cthat the\ninvestigation will be conducted pursuant to a legitimate purpose,\nthat the inquiry may be relevant to the purpose, that the\ninformation sought is not already within the [IRS\u2019s]\npossession, and that the administrative steps required by the\n[Internal Revenue] Code have been followed.\u201d United States v.\nPowell, 379 U.\u00a0S. 48 \u201358 (1964). To make that showing,\nthe IRS usually files an affidavit from the responsible\ninvestigating agent. See Stuart, 489 U.\u00a0S., at 360. The\ntaxpayer, however, has an opportunity to challenge that affidavit,\nand to urge the court to quash the summons \u201con any\nappropriate ground\u201d\u2014including, as relevant here,\nimproper purpose. See Reisman v. Caplin, 375 U.\u00a0S. 440, 449\n(1964) .The summons dispute in\nthis case arose from an IRS examination of the tax returns of\nDynamo Holdings Limited Partnership (Dynamo) for the\n2005\u20132007 tax years. The IRS harbored suspicions about large\ninterest expenses that those returns had reported. As its\ninvestigation proceeded, the Service persuaded Dynamo to agree to\ntwo year-long extensions of the usual 3-year limitations period for\nassessing tax liability; in 2010, with that period again drawing to\na close, Dynamo refused to grant the IRS a third extension. Shortly\nthereafter, in September and October 2010, the IRS issued summonses\nto the respondents here, four individuals associated with Dynamo\nwhom the Service believed had information and records relevant to\nDynamo\u2019s tax obligations. None of the respondents complied\nwith those summonses. In December 2010 (still within the augmented\nlimitations period), the IRS issued a Final Partnership\nAdministrative Adjustment proposing changes to Dynamo\u2019s\nreturns that would result in greater tax liability. Dynamo\nresponded in February 2011 by filing suit in the United States Tax\nCourt to challenge the adjustments. That litigation remains\npending. A few months later, in April 2011, the IRS instituted\nproceedings in District Court to compel the respondents to comply\nwith the summonses they had gotten.Those enforcement\nproceedings developed into a dispute about the IRS\u2019s reasons\nfor issuing the summonses. The IRS submitted an investigating\nagent\u2019s affidavit attesting to the Powell factors; among\nother things, that declaration maintained that the testimony and\nrecords sought were necessary to \u201cproperly investigate the\ncorrectness of [Dynamo\u2019s] federal tax reporting\u201d and\nthat the summonses were \u201cnot issued to harass or for any\nother improper purpose.\u201d App. 26, 34. In reply, the\nrespondents pointed to circumstantial evidence that, in their view,\nsuggested \u201culterior motive[s]\u201d of two different kinds.\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 72a. First, the respondents asserted that\nthe IRS issued the summonses to \u201cpunish[\u00a0] [Dynamo] for\nrefusing to agree to a further extension of the applicable statute\nof limitations.\u201d App. 52. More particularly, they stated in\nsworn declarations that immediately after Dynamo declined to grant\na third extension of time, the IRS, \u201cdespite having not asked\nfor additional information for some time, .\u00a0.\u00a0. suddenly\nissued\u201d the summonses. Id., at 95. Second, the respondents\naverred that the IRS decided to enforce the summonses, subsequent\nto Dynamo\u2019s filing suit in Tax Court, to \u201cevad[e] the\nTax Court[\u2019s] limitations on discovery\u201d and thus gain\nan unfair advantage in that litigation. Id., at 53. In support of\nthat charge, the respondents submitted an affidavit from the\nattorney of another Dynamo associate, who had chosen to comply with\na summons issued at the same time. The attorney reported that only\nthe IRS attorneys handling the Tax Court case, and not the original\ninvestigating agents, were present at the interview of his client.\nIn light of those submissions, the respondents asked for an\nopportunity to question the agents about their motives.The District Court\ndenied that request and ordered the respondents to comply with the\nsummonses. According to the court, the respondents \u201cha[d]\nmade no meaningful allegations of improper purpose\u201d\nwarranting examination of IRS agents. App. to Pet. for Cert. 18a.\nThe court characterized the respondents\u2019\nstatute-of-limitations theory as \u201cmere conjecture.\u201d\nId., at 14a. And it ruled that the respondents\u2019\nevasion-of-discovery-limits claim was \u201cincorrect as a matter\nof law\u201d because \u201c[t]he validity of a summons is tested\nas of the date of issuance,\u201d not enforcement\u2014and the\nTax Court proceedings had not yet begun when the IRS issued the\nsummonses. Id., at 15a.The Court of Appeals\nfor the Eleventh Circuit reversed, holding that the District\nCourt\u2019s refusal to allow the respondents to examine IRS\nagents constituted an abuse of discretion. In support of that\nruling, the Court of Appeals cited binding Circuit precedent\nholding that a simple \u201callegation of improper purpose,\u201d\neven if lacking any \u201cfactual support,\u201d entitles a\ntaxpayer to \u201cquestion IRS officials concerning the\nService\u2019s reasons for issuing the summons.\u201d 517 Fed.\nAppx. 689, 691 (2013) (quoting United States v. Southeast First\nNat. Bank of Miami Springs, 655 F. 2d 661, 667 (CA5 1981)); see\nNero Trading, LLC v. United States Dept. of Treasury, 570 F. 3d\n1244, 1249 (CA11 2009) (reaffirming Southeast).Every other Court of\nAppeals has rejected the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s view that a bare\nallegation of improper motive entitles a person objecting to an IRS\nsummons to examine the responsible officials.[2] We granted certiorari to resolve that conflict,\n571 U.\u00a0S. __ (2014), and we now vacate the Eleventh\nCircuit\u2019s opinion.IIA person receiving an\nIRS summons is, as we have often held, entitled to contest it in an\nenforcement proceeding. See United States v. Bisceglia, 420\nU.\u00a0S. 141, 146 (1975) ; Powell, 379 U.\u00a0S., at\n57\u201358; Reisman, 375 U.\u00a0S., at 449. The power\n\u201cvested in tax collectors may be abused, as all power\u201d\nmay be abused. Bisceglia, 420 U.\u00a0S., at 146. In recognition of\nthat possibility, Congress made enforcement of an IRS summons\ncontingent on a court\u2019s approval. See 26 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a77604(b). And we have time and again stated that the requisite\njudicial proceeding is not ex\u00a0parte but adversarial. See\nDonaldson v. United States, 400 U.\u00a0S. 517, 527 (1971) ;\nPowell, 379 U.\u00a0S., at 58; Reisman, 375 U.\u00a0S., at 446. The\nsummoned party must receive notice, and may present argument and\nevidence on all matters bearing on a summons\u2019s validity. See\nPowell, 379 U.\u00a0S.,at 58.Yet we have also\nemphasized that summons enforcement proceedings are to be\n\u201csummary in nature.\u201d Stuart, 489 U.\u00a0S., at 369.\nThe purpose of a summons is \u201cnot to accuse,\u201d much less\nto adjudicate, but only \u201cto inquire.\u201d Bisceglia, 420\nU.\u00a0S., at 146. And such an investigatory tool, we have\nrecognized, is a crucial backstop in a tax system based on\nself-reporting. See ibid. (restricting summons authority would\nenable \u201cdishonest persons [to] escap[e] taxation[,] thus\nshifting heavier burdens to honest taxpayers\u201d). Accordingly,\nwe long ago held that courts may ask only whether the IRS issued a\nsummons in good faith, and must eschew any broader role of\n\u201coversee[ing] the [IRS\u2019s] determinations to\ninvestigate.\u201d Powell, 379 U.\u00a0S., at 56. So too, we\nstated that absent contrary evidence, the IRS can satisfy that\nstandard by submitting a simple affidavit from the investigating\nagent. See Stuart, 489 U.\u00a0S., at 359\u2013360. Thus, we have\nrejected rules that would \u201cthwart and defeat the\n[Service\u2019s] appropriate investigatory powers.\u201d\nDonaldson, 400 U.\u00a0S., at 533.The balance we have\nstruck in prior cases comports with the following rule, applicable\nhere: As part of the adversarial process concerning a\nsummons\u2019s validity, the taxpayer is entitled to examine an\nIRS agent when he can point to specific facts or circumstances\nplausibly raising an inference of bad faith. Naked allegations of\nimproper purpose are not enough: The taxpayer must offer some\ncredible evidence supporting his charge. But circumstantial\nevidence can suffice to meet that burden; after all, direct\nevidence of another person\u2019s bad faith, at this threshold\nstage, will rarely if ever be available. And although bare\nassertion or conjecture is not enough, neither is a fleshed out\ncase demanded: The taxpayer need only make a showing of facts that\ngive rise to a plausible inference of improper motive. That\nstandard will ensure inquiry where the facts and circumstances make\ninquiry appropriate, without turning every summons dispute into a\nfishing expedition for official wrongdoing. And the rule is little\ndifferent from the one that both the respondents and the Government\nhave recommended to us.[3]But that is not the\nstandard the Eleventh Circuit applied. Although the respondents\ngamely try to put an-other face on the opinion below, see Brief for\nRespondents 24\u201325, and n.\u00a017, we have no doubt that the\nCourt of Appeals viewed even bare allegations of improper purpose\nas entitling a summons objector to question IRS agents. The court\nin fact had some evidence before it pertaining to the\nrespondents\u2019 charges: The respondents, for example, had\nsubmitted one declaration relating the timing of the summonses to\nDynamo\u2019s refusal to extend the limitations period, see App.\n95, and another aiming to show that the IRS was using the summonses\nto obtain discovery it could not get in Tax Court, see id., at\n97\u2013100. But the Eleventh Circuit never assessed whether those\n(or any other) materials plausibly supported an inference of\nimproper motive; indeed, the court never mentioned the proffered\nevidence at all. Instead, and in line with Circuit precedent, the\ncourt applied a categorical rule, demanding the examination of IRS\nagents even when a taxpayer made only conclusory allegations. See\nsupra, at 4. That was error. On remand, the Court of Appeals must\nconsider the respond-ents\u2019 submissions in light of the\nstandard we have stated.That consideration must\nas well give appropriate deference to the District Court\u2019s\nruling. An appellate court, as the Eleventh Circuit noted, reviews\nfor abuse of discretion a trial court\u2019s decision to\norder\u2014or not\u2014the questioning of IRS agents. See 517\nFed. Appx., at 691, n.\u00a02; Tiffany Fine Arts, Inc. v. United\nStates, 469 U.\u00a0S. 310 , n.\u00a07 (1985). That standard of\nreview reflects the district court\u2019s supe-rior familiarity\nwith, and understanding of, the dispute; andit comports with the\nway appellate courts review related matters of case management,\ndiscovery, and trial prac-tice. See, e.g., Hoffmann-La Roche Inc.\nv. Sperling, 493 U.\u00a0S. 165 \u2013173 (1989); Crawford-El v.\nBritton, 523 U.\u00a0S. 574 \u2013601 (1998). Accordingly, the\nCourt of Appeals must take into account on remand the District\nCourt\u2019s broad discretion to determine whether a tax-payer has\nshown enough to require the examination of IRS investigators.But two caveats to that\ninstruction are in order here. First, the District Court\u2019s\ndecision is entitled to deference only if based on the correct\nlegal standard. See Fox v. Vice, 563 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2011)\n(slip op., at 11) (\u201cA trial court has wide discretion when,\nbut only when, it calls the game by the right rules\u201d). We\nleave to the Court of Appeals the task of deciding whether the\nDistrict Court asked and answered the relevant question\u2014once\nagain, whether the respondents pointed to specific facts or\ncircumstances plausibly raising an inference of improper\nmotive.And second, the\nDistrict Court\u2019s latitude does not extend to legal issues\nabout what counts as an illicit motive. As indicated earlier, one\nsuch issue is embedded in the respondents\u2019 claim that the\nGovernment moved to enforce these summonses to gain an unfair\nadvantage in Tax Court litigation. See supra, at 4. The Government\nresponds, and the District Court agreed, that any such purpose is\nirrelevant because \u201cthe validity of a summons is judged at\nthe time\u201d the IRS originally issued the summons, and here\nthat preceded the Tax Court suit. Tr. of Oral Arg. 7; see Reply\nBrief 19\u201320; App. to Pet. for Cert. 15a. Similarly, with\nrespect to the respondents\u2019 alternative theory, the\nGovernment briefly suggested at argument that issuing a summons\nbecause \u201ca taxpayer declined to extend a statute of\nlimitations would [not] be an improper purpose,\u201d even\nassuming that happened here. Tr. of Oral Arg. 6. We state no view\non those issues; they are not within the question presented for our\nreview. We note only that they are pure questions of law, so if\nthey arise again on remand, the Court of Appeals has no cause to\ndefer to the District Court. Cf. Koon v. United States, 518\nU.\u00a0S. 81, 100 (1996) (\u201cA district court by definition\nabuses its discretion when it makes an error of law\u201d).For these reasons, we\nvacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.Notes1The IRS has authority to\nsummon not only \u201cthe person liable for tax,\u201d but also\n\u201cany officer or employee of such person,\u201d any person\nhaving custody of relevant \u201cbooks of account,\u201d and\n\u201cany other person the [IRS] may deem proper.\u201d . For\nconvenience, this opinion refers only to the\n\u201ctaxpayer.\u201d2See, , v. , 584 F. 3d\n340, 350\u2013351 (CA1 2009) (requiring \u201ca sufficient\nthreshold showing that there was an improper purpose\u201d); v. ,\n59 F.\u00a03d 117, 121 (CA9 1995) (requiring \u201csome minimal\namount of evidence\u201d beyond \u201cmere memoranda of law or\nallegations\u201d (internal quotations and alterations omitted));\nv. , 658 F. 2d 526, 540 (CA7 1981) (requiring \u201cdevelop[ment]\n[of] facts from which a court might infer a possibility of some\nwrongful conduct\u201d); v. , 607 F.\u00a02d 61, 71 (CA3 1979)\n(requiring \u201cfactual[\u00a0] support[\u00a0] by the\ntaxpayer\u2019s affidavits\u201d).3See Tr. of Oral Arg. 29\n(respondents) (The taxpayer is entitled to question the agent\n\u201cwhen he presents specific facts from which an improper\npurpose .\u00a0.\u00a0. may plausibly be inferred\u201d); , at 5\n(United States) (\u201c[A] summons opponent has to put in enough\nevidence to at least raise an inference\u201d of improper motive,\nand \u201c[c]ircumstantial evidence is\nenough\u201d).",
