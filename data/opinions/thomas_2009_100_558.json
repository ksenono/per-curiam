S. ____ (2009)SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESNO. 08-678MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC., PETITIONERv.NORMAN CARPENTERon writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the eleventh circuit[December 8, 2009]Justice Thomas, concurring in\npart and concurring in the judgment.I concur in the judgment and in\nPart II\u2013C of the Court\u2019s opinion because I wholeheartedly agree\nthat \u201cCongress\u2019s designation of the rulemaking process as the way\nto define or refine when a district court ruling is \u2018final\u2019 and\nwhen an interlocutory order is appealable warrants the Judiciary\u2019s\nfull respect.\u201dSwintv.Chambers County Comm\u2019n,514 U. S. 35, 48\n(1995);ante, at 13 (quotingSwint,supra;citingCunninghamv.Hamilton\nCounty,527 U.\nS. 198, 210 (1999)). It is for that reason that I do not join\nthe remainder of the Court\u2019s analysis.The scope of federal appellate jurisdiction is\na matter the Constitution expressly commits to Congress, see\nArt.\u00a0I, \u00a78, cl. 9, and that Congress has addressed not only in\n28 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a71291 and 1292, but also in the Rules Enabling\nAct amendments to which the Court refers. Seeante, at\n12\u201313 (citing \u00a7\u00a72072\u20132074). The Court recognizes that these\namendments \u201cdesignat[e] rulemaking, \u2018not expansion by court\ndecision,\u2019 as the preferred means of determining whether and when\nprejudgment orders should be immediately appealable.\u201dAnte, at 12 (quotingSwint,supra, at\n48). Because that designation is entitled to our full respect, and\nbecause the privilege order here is not on all fours with orders we\npreviously have held to be appealable under the collateral order\ndoctrine, seeCohenv.Beneficial Industrial Loan\nCorp.,337 U.\nS. 541(1949), I would affirm the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s judgment\non the ground that any \u201cavenue for immediate appeal\u201d beyond the\nthree avenues addressed in the Court\u2019s opinion must be left to the\n\u201crulemaking process.\u201dAnte, at 13; seeante, at\n9\u201312 (discussing certification under 28 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71292(b),\npetitions for mandamus, and appeals from contempt orders).We need not, and in my view should not,\nfurther justify our holding by applying theCohendoctrine, which prompted the rulemaking amendments in the first\nplace. In taking this path, the Court needlessly perpetuates a\njudicial policy that we for many years have criticized and\nstruggled to limit. See,e.g.,Ashcroftv.Iqbal, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 8);Willv.Hallock,546 U. S. 345, 349\n(2006);Sellv.United States,539 U. S. 166, 177\n(2003);Cunningham,supra, at 210;Digital\nEquipment Corp.v.Desktop Direct, Inc.,511 U. S. 863, 884\n(1994);Swint, supra, at 48;Lauro Lines s.r.l.v.Chasser,490 U. S. 495, 498\u2013501\n(1989);Van Cauwenberghev.Biard,486 U. S. 517, 527\n(1988). The Court\u2019s choice of analysis is the more ironic because\napplyingCohento the facts of this case requires the\nCourt to reach conclusions on, and thus potentially prejudice, the\nvery matters it says would benefit from \u201cthe collective experience\nof bench and bar\u201d and the \u201copportunity for full airing\u201d that\nrulemaking provides.Ante, at 13.\u201cFinality as a condition of review is an\nhistoric characteristic of federal appellate procedure\u201d that was\nincorporated in the first Judiciary Act and that Congress itself\nhas \u201cdeparted from only when observance of it would practically\ndefeat the right to any review at all.\u201dCobbledickv.United States,309 U. S. 323, 324\u2013325\n(1940). Until 1949, this Court\u2019s view of the appellate jurisdiction\nstatute reflected this principle and the statute\u2019s text. See,e.g.,Catlinv.United States,324 U. S. 229, 233\n(1945) (holding that \u00a7128 of the Judicial Code (now 28 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a71291) limits review to decisions that \u201cen[d] the\nlitigation on the merits and leav[e] nothing for the court to do\nbut execute the judgment\u201d).Cohenchanged all that when it\nannounced that a \u201csmall class\u201d of collateral orders that do not\nmeet the statutory definition of finality nonetheless may be\nimmediately appealable if they satisfy certain criteria that show\nthey are \u201ctoo important to be denied review.\u201d 337 U. S., at\n546.Cohenand the early decisions\napplying it allowed \u00a71291 appeals of interlocutory orders\nconcerning the posting of a bond, seeid., at 545\u2013547, the\nattachment of a vessel in admiralty, seeSwift & Co.\nPackersv.Compania Colombiana Del Caribe,\nS.\u00a0A.,339\nU. S. 684, 688\u2013689 (1950), and the imposition of notice costs\nin a class action, seeEisenv.Carlisle &\nJacquelin,417\nU. S. 156, 170\u2013172 (1974). As the Court\u2019s opinion notes, later\ndecisions sought to narrowCohenlest its exception to\n\u00a71291 \u201c\u00a0\u2018\u00a0swallow\u2019\u00a0\u201d the final judgment rule.Ante, at 5 (quotingDigital Equipment,supra, at 868); see generallyCoopers &\nLybrandv.Livesay,437 U. S. 463, 467\u2013468\n(1978). The Court has adhered to that narrowing approach,\nprincipally by raising the bar on what types of interests are\n\u201cimportant enough\u201d to justify collateral order appeals. See,e.g.,Will,supra, at 352\u2013353\n(explaining that an interlocutory order typically will be\n\u201cimportant\u201d enough to justifyCohenreview only where\n\u201csome particular value of a high order,\u201d such as \u201chonoring the\nseparation of powers, preserving the efficiency of government . . .\n, [or] respecting a State\u2019s dignitary interests,\u201d is \u201cmarshaled in\nsupport of the interest in avoiding trial\u201d and the Court determines\nthat denying review would \u201cimperil\u201d that interest);Digital\nEquipment,supra, at 878\u2013879 (noting that\nappealability underCohenturns on a \u201cjudgment about the\nvalue of the interests that would be lost through rigorous\napplication of a final judgment requirement,\u201d and that an interest\n\u201cqualifies as \u2018important\u2019 inCohen\u2019s sense\u201d if it is\n\u201cweightier than the societal interests advanced by the ordinary\noperation of final judgment principles\u201d). As we recognized last\nTerm, however, our attempts to contain theCohendoctrine\nhave not all been successful or persuasive. SeeAshcroft,supra,at ___ (slip op., at 8) (\u201c[A]s a general matter,\nthe collateral-order doctrine may have expanded beyond the limits\ndictated by its internal logic and the strict application of the\ncriteria set out inCohen\u201d). In my view, this case\npresents an opportunity to improve our approach.The privilege interest at issue here is\nundoubtedly important, both in its own right and when compared to\nsome of the interests (e.g., in bond and notice-cost\nrulings) we have held to be appealable underCohen.\nAccordingly, the Court\u2019sCohenanalysis does not rest on\nthe privilege order\u2019s relative unimportance, but instead on its\neffective reviewability after final judgment.Ante, at\n8\u201312. Although I agree with the Court\u2019s ultimate conclusion, I see\ntwo difficulties with this approach. First, the Court emphasizes\nthat the alternative avenues of review it discusses (which did not\nprove adequate in this case) would be adequate where the privilege\nruling at issue is \u201cparticularly injurious or novel.\u201dAnte, at 9. If that is right, and it seems to me that it\nis, then the opinion raises the question why such avenues were not\nalso adequate to address the orders whose unusual importance or\nparticularly injurious nature we have heldjustifiedimmediate appeal underCohen. See,e.g.,Sell,supra, at 177. Second, the facts of this\nparticular case seem in several respects to undercut the Court\u2019s\nconclusion that the benefits of collateral order review \u201ccannot\njustify the likely institutional costs.\u201dAnte, at 11.* The\nCourt responds that these case-specific arguments miss the point\nbecause the focus of theCohenanalysis is whether the\n\u201centire category\u201d or \u201cclass of claims\u201d at issue merits appellate\nreview under the collateral order doctrine.Ante, at 6\n(internal quotation marks omitted). That is exactly right, and\nillustrates what increasingly has bothered me about making this\nkind of appealability determination via case-by-case adjudication.\nThe exercise forces the reviewing court to subordinate the\nrealities of each case before it to generalized conclusions about\nthe \u201clikely\u201d costs and benefits of allowing an exception to the\nfinal judgment rule in an entire \u201cclass of cases.\u201d The Court\nconcedes that Congress, which holds the constitutional reins in\nthis area, has determined that such value judgments are better left\nto the \u201ccollective experience of bench and bar\u201d and the\n\u201copportunity for full airing\u201d that rulemaking provides.Ante, at 13. This determination is entitled to our full\nrespect, in deed as well as in word. Accordingly, I would leave the\nvalue judgments the Court makes in its opinion to the rulemaking\nprocess, and in so doing take this opportunity to\nlimit\u2014effectively, predictably, and in a way we should have done\nlong ago\u2014the doctrine that, with a sweep of the Court\u2019s pen,\nsubordinated what the appellate jurisdiction statute says to what\nthe Court thinks is a good idea.*\u00a0The Court concludes, for example, that in\nmost cases final judgment review of an erroneous privilege ruling\nwill suffice to vindicate the injured party\u2019s rights because the\nappellate court can vacate the adverse judgment and remand for a\nnew trial in which the protected material is excluded.Ante, at 8. But this case appears to involve one of the\n(perhaps rare) situations in which final judgment review might not\nbe sufficient because it is a case in which the challenged order\nalready has had \u201cimplications beyond the case at hand,\u201d namely, in\nthe separate class action inWilliamsv.Mohawk\nIndus., Inc.,No. 4:04\u2013CV\u20130003\u2013HLM (ND Ga.).Ante, at\n11. The Court also concludes that the \u201clikely institutional costs\u201d\nof allowing collateral order review would outweigh its benefits\nbecause,inter alia, such review would \u201cneedlessly burden\nthe Courts of Appeals.\u201dIbid. But as the Court concedes,\nit must speculate on this point because the three Circuits that\nallowCohenappeals of privilege rulings have not been\noverwhelmed. Seeante, at 12.",
