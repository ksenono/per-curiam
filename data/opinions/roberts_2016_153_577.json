    "text": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES_________________No. 14\u2013857_________________CAMPBELL-EWALD COMPANY, PETITIONERv.JOSE GOMEZon writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the ninth circuit[January 20, 2016]Chief Justice Roberts, with whom Justice\nScalia and Justice Alito join, dissenting.This case is straightforward. Jose Gomez alleges\nthat the marketing firm Campbell-Ewald (Campbell) sent him text\nmessages without his permission, and he requests relief under the\nTelephone Consumer Protection Act. That Act permits consumers to\nrecover statutory damages for unauthorized text messages. Based on\nGomez\u2019s allegations, the maximum that he could recover under the\nAct is $1500 per text message, plus the costs of filing suit.\nCampbell has offered to pay Gomez that amount, but it turns out he\nwants more. He wants a federal court to say he is right.The problem for Gomez is that the federal courts\nexist to resolve real disputes, not to rule on a plaintiff\u2019s\nentitlement to relief already there for the taking. As this Court\nhas said, \u201c[n]o principle is more fundamental to the judiciary\u2019s\nproper role in our system of government than the constitutional\nlimitation of federal-court jurisdiction to actual cases or\ncontroversies.\u201dRainesv.Byrd, 521 U.\u00a0S. 811,\n818 (1997) (quotingSimonv.Eastern Ky. Welfare Rights\nOrganization, 426 U.\u00a0S. 26, 37 (1976) ). If there is no\nactual case or controversy, the lawsuit is moot, and the power of\nthe federal courts to declare the law has come to an end. Here, the\nDistrict Court found that Campbell agreed to fully satisfy Gomez\u2019s\nclaims. That makes the case moot, and Gomez is not entitled to a\nruling on the merits of a moot case.I respectfully dissent.IAIn 1793, President George Washington sent a\nletter to Chief Justice John Jay and the Associate Justices of the\nSupreme Court, asking for the opinion of the Court on the rights\nand obligations of the United States with respect to the war\nbetween Great Britain and France. The Supreme Court politely\u2014but\nfirmly\u2014refused the request, concluding that \u201cthe lines of\nseparation drawn by the Constitution between the three departments\nof the government\u201d pro-hibit the federal courts from issuing such\nadvisory opinions. 3 Correspondence and Public Papers of John Jay\n486\u2013489 (H. Johnston ed. 1890\u20131893).That prohibition has remained \u201cthe oldest and\nmost consistent thread in the federal law of justiciability.\u201dFlastv.Cohen, 392 U.\u00a0S. 83, 96 (1968)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). And for good reason. It is\nderived from Article III of the Constitution, which limits the\nauthority of the federal courts to the adjudication of \u201cCases\u201d or\n\u201cControversies.\u201d U.\u00a0S. Const., Art.\u00a0III, \u00a72. The case or\ncontroversy requirement is at once an important check on the powers\nof the Federal Judiciary and the source of those powers. InMarburyv.Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 177 (1803), Chief\nJustice Marshall established that it is \u201cthe province and duty of\nthe judicial department to say what the law is.\u201d Not because there\nis a provision in the Constitution that says so\u2014there isn\u2019t.\nInstead, the federal courts wield that power because they have to\ndecide cases and controversies, and \u201c[t]hose who apply [a] rule to\nparticular cases, must of necessity expound and interpret that\nrule.\u201dIbid.Federal courts may exercise their authority\n\u201conly in the last resort, and as a necessity in the determination\nof real, earnest and vital controversy between individuals.\u201dChicago & Grand Trunk R. Co.v.Wellman, 143\nU.\u00a0S. 339, 345 (1892) ; see alsoAllenv.Wright, 468 U.\u00a0S. 737, 752 (1984) . \u201cIf a dispute is\nnot a proper case or controversy, the courts have no business\ndeciding it, or expounding the law in the course of doing so.\u201dDaimlerChrysler Corp.v.Cuno, 547 U.\u00a0S. 332,\n341 (2006) .A case or controversy exists when both the\nplaintiff and the defendant have a \u201cpersonal stake\u201d in the lawsuit.Camretav.Greene, 563 U.\u00a0S. 692, 701 (2011) . A\nplaintiff demonstrates a personal stake by establishing standing to\nsue, which requires a \u201cpersonal injury fairly traceable to the\ndefendant\u2019s allegedly unlawful conduct and likely to be redressed\nby the requested relief.\u201dAllen, 468 U.\u00a0S., at 751. A\ndefendant demonstrates a personal stake through \u201can ongoing\ninterest in the dispute.\u201dCamreta, 563 U.\u00a0S., at\n701.The personal stake requirement persists through\nevery stage of the lawsuit. It \u201cis not enough that a dispute was\nvery much alive when suit was filed\u201d; the \u201cparties must continue to\nhave a personal stake in the outcome of the lawsuit\u201d to prevent the\ncase from becoming moot.Lewisv.Continental Bank\nCorp., 494 U.\u00a0S. 472 \u2013478 (1990) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). If either the plaintiff or the defendant ceases to have a\nconcrete interest in the outcome of the litigation, there is no\nlonger a live case or controversy. A federal court that decides the\nmerits of such a case runs afoul of the prohibition on advisory\nopinions.BApplying those basic principles to this case,\nit is clear that the lawsuit is moot. All agree that at the time\nGomez filed suit, he had a personal stake in the litigation. In his\ncomplaint, Gomez alleged that he suffered an injury in fact when he\nreceived unauthorized text messages from Campbell. To remedy that\ninjury, he requested $1500 in statutory damages for each\nunauthorized text message. (It was later determined that he\nreceived only one text message.)What happened next, however, is critical: After\nGomez\u2019s initial legal volley, Campbell did not return fire.\nInstead, Campbell responded to the complaint with a freestanding\noffer to pay Gomez the maximum amount that he could recover under\nthe statute: $1500 per unauthorized text message, plus court costs.\nCampbell also made an offer of judgment on the same terms under\nRule 68 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which permits a\ndefendant to recover certain attorney\u2019s fees if the Rule 68 offer\nis unaccepted and the plaintiff later recovers no more than the\namount of the offer. Crucially, the District Court found that the\n\u201cparties do not dispute\u201d that Campbell\u2019s Rule 68 offer\u2014reflecting\nthe same terms as the freestanding offer\u2014\u201cwould have fully\nsatisfied the individual claims asserted, or that could have been\nasserted,\u201d by Gomez. 805 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d 923, 927 (CD Cal.\n2011).When a plaintiff files suit seeking redress for\nan alleged injury, and the defendantagreesto fully redress\nthat injury, there is no longer a case or controversy for pur-poses\nof Article III. After all, if the defendant is willing to remedy\nthe plaintiff\u2019s injury without forcing him to litigate, the\nplaintiff cannot demonstrate an injury in need of redress by the\ncourt, and the defendant\u2019s interests are not adverse to the\nplaintiff. At that point, there is no longer any \u201cnecessity\u201d to\n\u201cexpound and interpret\u201d the law,Marbury, 1 Cranch, at 177,\nand the federal courts lack authority to hear the case. That is\nexactly what happened here: Once Campbell offered to fully remedy\nGomez\u2019s injury, there was no longer any \u201cnecessity\u201d for the\nDistrict Court to hear the merits of his case, rendering the\nlawsuit moot.[1]It is true that although Campbell has offered\nGomez full relief, Campbell has not yet paid up. That does not\naffect the mootness inquiry under the facts of this case. Campbell\nis a multimillion dollar company, and the settlement offer here is\nfor a few thousand dollars. The settlement offer promises \u201cprompt\npayment,\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 59a, and it would be mere\npettifoggery to argue that Campbell might not make good on that\npromise. In any event, to the extent there is a question whether\nCampbell is willing and able to pay, there is an easy answer: have\nthe firm deposit a certified check with the trial court.IIThe Court today holds that Gomez\u2019s lawsuit is\nnot moot. According to the Court, \u201cAn unaccepted settlement\noffer\u2014like any unaccepted contract offer\u2014is a legal nullity, with\nno operative effect.\u201dAnte,at 7\u20138 (quotingGenesis\nHealthCare Corp.v.Symczyk, 569 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___\n(2013) (Kagan, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 3)). And so, the Court\nconcludes, if a plaintiff does not feel like accepting the\ndefendant\u2019s complete offer of relief, the lawsuit cannot be moot\nbecause it is as if no offer had ever been made.But a plaintiff is not the judge of whether\nfederal litigation is necessary, and a meredesirethat\nthere be federal litigation\u2014for whatever reason\u2014does not make itnecessary. When a lawsuit is filed, it is up to the federal\ncourt to determine whether a concrete case or controversy exists\nbetween the parties. That remains true throughout the litigation.\nArticle III does not require the parties to affirmatively agree on\na settlement before a case becomes moot. This Court has long held\nthat when a defendant unilaterally remedies the injuries of the\nplaintiff, the case is moot\u2014even if the plaintiff disagrees and\nrefuses to settle the dispute, and even if the defendant continues\nto deny liability.InCaliforniav.San Pablo &\nTulare R. Co., 149 U.\u00a0S. 308 (1893) , the State of\nCalifornia brought suit against a railroad company for back taxes.\nBefore oral argument in this Court, the railroad offered to pay\nCalifornia the entire sum at issue, \u201ctogether with interest,\npenalties and costs.\u201dId.,at 313. Although California\ncontinued to litigate the case despite the railroad\u2019s offer of\ncomplete relief, the Court concluded that the offer to pay the full\nsum, in addition to \u201cthe deposit of the money in a bank, which by a\nstatute of the State ha[s] the same effect as actual payment and\nreceipt of the money,\u201d mooted the case.Id.,at 314.The Court grounded its decision inSan\nPabloon the prohibition against advisory opinions, explaining\nthat \u201cthe court is not empowered to decide moot questions or\nabstract propositions, or to declare, for the government of future\ncases, principles or rules of law which cannot affect the result as\nto the thing in issue in the case.\u201dIbid.Although the\nmajority here places great weight on Gomez\u2019s rejection of\nCampbell\u2019s offer of complete relief,San Pablodid not\nconsider the agreement of the parties to be relevant to the\nquestion of mootness. As the Court said then, \u201c[n]o stipulation of\nparties or counsel, whether in the case before the court or in any\nother case, can enlarge the power, or affect the duty, of the\ncourt.\u201dIbid.More recently, inAlvarezv.Smith, 558 U.\u00a0S. 87 (2009) , the Court found that a\nplaintiff\u2019s refusal to settle a case did not prevent it from\nbecoming moot. InAlvarez, Chi-cago police officers had\nseized vehicles and cash from six individuals. The individuals\nfiled suit against the city and two officials, claiming that they\nwere entitled to a timely post-seizure hearing to seek the return\nof their property. The Court of Appeals ruled for the plaintiffs,\nand this Court granted certiorari.At oral argument, the parties informed the Court\nthat the cars and some of the cash had been returned, and that the\nplaintiffs no longer sought the return of the remainder of the\ncash.Id., at 92. Nevertheless, the plaintiffs\u2014much like\nGomez\u2014\u201ccontinue[d] to dispute the lawfulness of the State\u2019s hearing\nprocedures.\u201dId.,at 93. Although the plaintiffs refused to\nsettle the case, and the defendants would not concede that the\nhearing procedures were unlawful, the Court held that the case was\nmoot. As the Court explained, the \u201cdispute is no longer embedded in\nany actual controversy about the plaintiffs\u2019 particular legal\nrights,\u201d and \u201ca dispute solely about the meaning of a law,\nabstracted from any concrete actual or threatened harm, falls\noutside the scope of the constitutional words \u2018Cases\u2019 and\n\u2018Controversies.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIbid.The Court reached a similar conclusion inAlready, LLCv.Nike, Inc., 568 U.\u00a0S. ___\n(2013). In that case, Nike filed suit alleging that two of\nAlready\u2019s athletic shoes violated Nike\u2019s Air Force 1 trademark. In\nresponse, Already filed a counterclaim alleging that Nike\u2019s\ntrademark was invalid. Instead of litigating the counterclaim, Nike\nissued aunilateralcovenant not to sue Already. In that\ncovenant, Nike \u201cunconditionally and irrevocably\u201d promised not to\nraise any trademark or unfair competition claims against Already\nbased on its current shoe designs or any future \u201ccolorable\nimitations\u201d of those designs.Id.,at ___ (slip op., at 6).\nNike did not, however, admit that its trademark was invalid. After\nissuing the covenant, Nike asked the District Court to dismiss the\ncounterclaim as moot.Id.,at ___ (slip op., at 2).Already did not agree to Nike\u2019s covenant, and it\ndid not view the covenant as sufficient to protect it from future\ntrademark litigation. Already argued that without judicial\nresolution of the dispute, \u201cNike\u2019s trademarks [would] hang over\nAlready\u2019s operations like a Damoclean sword.\u201dId.,at ___\n(slip op., at 9). This Court disagreed and dismissed the suit. It\nfound that because Nike had demonstrated \u201cthat the covenant\nencompasses all of [Nike\u2019s] allegedly unlawful conduct,\u201d and that\nthe \u201cchallenged conduct cannot reasonably be expected to recur,\u201d\nthe counterclaim was moot.Id.,at ___ (slip op., at\n7\u20138).These precedents reflect an important\nconstitutional principle: The agreement of the plaintiff is not\nrequired to moot a case. InSan Pablo, California did not\naccept the railroad\u2019s money in exchange for settling the State\u2019s\nlegal claims; inAlvarez, the plaintiffs did not receive\ntheir cars and cash in return for an agreement to stop litigating\nthe case; and inAlready, the eponymous shoe company never\nagreed to Nike\u2019s covenant not to sue. In each of those cases,\ndespite the plaintiff\u2019s desire not to settle, the Court held that\nthe lawsuit was moot.The majority attempts to distinguish these\nprecedents by emphasizing that the plaintiffs in all three cases\nreceived complete relief, but that is not the point. I had thought\nthat the theory of the Court\u2019s opinion was that acceptance is\nrequired before complete relief will moot a case. But consider the\nmajority\u2019s discussion ofAlready: What did Nike\u2019s covenant\ndo? It \u201cafforded Already blanket protection from future trademark\nlitigation.\u201dAnte,at 10, n.\u00a05. What happened as a\nresult of this complete relief\u00a0? \u201cThe risk that underpinned\nAlready\u2019s standing\u201d thus \u201cceased to exist.\u201dIbid.Even\nthough what? Even though \u201cNike\u2019s covenant was unilateral,\u201d and not\naccepted by Already.Ibid.The majority is correct that because Gomez did\nnot accept Campbell\u2019s settlement, it is a \u201clegal nullity\u201d as a\nmatter of contract law. The question, however, is not whether there\nis a contract; it is whether there is a case or controversy under\nArticle III.[2] If the\ndefendant is willing to give the plaintiff everything he asks for,\nthere is no case or controversy to adjudicate, and the lawsuit is\nmoot.[3]*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*The case or controversy requirement serves an\nessential purpose: It ensures that the federal courts expound the\nlaw \u201conly in the last resort, and as a necessity.\u201dAllen,\n468 U.\u00a0S., at 752 (internal quotation marks omitted). It is\nthe necessity of resolving a live dispute that reconciles the\nexercise of profound power by unelected judges with the principles\nof self-governance, ensuring adherence to \u201cthe proper\u2014and properly\nlimited\u2014role of the courts in a democratic society.\u201dId.,at\n750 (internal quotation marks omitted).There is no such necessity here. As the District\nCourt found, Campbell offered Gomez full relief. Although Gomez\nnonetheless wants to continue litigating, the issue is not what the\nplaintiffwants, but what the federal courts may do. It is\nup to those courts to decide whether each party continues to have\nthe requisite personal stake in the lawsuit, and if not, to dismiss\nthe case as moot. The Court today takes that important\nresponsibility away from the federal courts and hands it to the\nplaintiff.The good news is that this case is limited to\nits facts. The majority holds that anofferof complete\nrelief is insufficient to moot a case. The majority does not say\nthatpaymentof complete relief leads to the same result.\nFor aught that appears, the majority\u2019s analysis may have come out\ndifferently if Campbell had deposited the offered funds with the\nDistrict Court. Seeante,at 11\u201312. This Court leaves that\nquestion for another day\u2014assuming there are other plaintiffs out\nthere who, like Gomez, won\u2019t take \u201cyes\u201d for an answer.Notes1The Court does not reach\nthe question whether Gomez\u2019s claim for class relief prevents this\ncase from becoming moot. The majority nev-ertheless suggests that\nCampbell \u201csought to avoid a potential ad-verse decision, one that\ncould expose it to damages a thousand-fold larger than the bid\nGomez declined to accept.\u201dAnte,at 11. But under this\nCourt\u2019s precedents Gomez does not have standing to seek relief\nbased solely on the alleged injuries of others, and Gomez\u2019s\ninterest in sharing attorney\u2019s fees among class members or in\nobtaining a class incentive award does not create Article III\nstanding. SeeLewisv.Continental Bank Corp., 494\nU.\u00a0S. 472, 480 (1990) (An \u201cinterest in attorney\u2019s fees is, of\ncourse, insufficient to create an Article III case or controversy\nwhere none exists on the merits of the underlying claim.\u201d);Steel Co.v.Citizens for Better Environment, 523\nU.\u00a0S. 83, 107 (1998) (\u201cObviously, however, a plaintiff cannot\nachieve standing to litigate a substantive issue by bringing suit\nfor the cost of bringing suit. The litigation must give the\nplaintiff some other benefit besides reimbursement of costs that\nare a byproduct of the litigation itself.\u201d).2The majority suggests\nthat this case is analogous toU.\u00a0S. Bancorp Mortgage\nCo.v.Bonner Mall Partnership, 513 U.\u00a0S. 18 (1994)\n, where the Court declined to vacate a lower court decision that\nbecame moot on certiorari when the parties voluntarily settled the\ncase.Bancorpis inapposite\u2014it involves the equitable powers\nof the courts to vacate judgments in moot cases, not the Article\nIII question whether a case is moot in the first place. The premise\nofBancorpis that it is up to the federal courts\u2014and not\nthe parties\u2014to decide what to do once a case becomes moot. The\nmajority\u2019s position, in contrast, would leave it to the plaintiff\nto decide whether a case is moot.3To further support its\nArticle III-by-contract theory of the case, the Court looks to\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 68, which states that an unaccepted\noffer of judgment \u201cis considered withdrawn.\u201d Rule 68(b). But\nCampbell made Gomez both a Rule 68 offeranda freestanding\nsettlement offer. By its terms, Rule 68 does not apply to the\nlatter. The majority\u2019s only argument with respect to the\nfreestanding settlement offer is that under the rules of contract\nlaw, an unaccepted offer is a \u201clegal nullity.\u201dAnte, at 7.\nAs explained, however, under the principles of Article III, an\nunaccepted offer of complete relief moots a case.",
