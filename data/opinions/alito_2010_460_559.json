S. ____ (2010)SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESNO. 08-769UNITED STATES, PETITIONERv.ROBERT J.\nSTEVENSon writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the third circuit[April 20, 2010]Justice Alito, dissenting.The Court strikes down in its\nentirety a valuable statute, 18 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a748, that was enacted\nnot to suppress speech, but to prevent horrific acts of animal\ncruelty\u2014in particular, the creation and commercial exploitation of\n\u201ccrush videos,\u201d a form of depraved entertainment that has no social\nvalue. The Court\u2019s approach, which has the practical effect of\nlegalizing the sale of such videos and is thus likely to spur a\nresumption of their production, is unwarranted. Respondent was\nconvicted under \u00a748 for selling videos depicting dogfights. On\nappeal, he argued, among other things, that \u00a748 is unconstitutional\nas applied to the facts of this case, and he highlighted features\nof those videos that might distinguish them from other dogfight\nvideos brought to our attention.[Footnote 1] The Court of Appeals\u2014incorrectly, in my\nview\u2014declined to decide whether \u00a748 is unconstitutional as applied\nto respondent\u2019s videos and instead reached out to hold that the\nstatute is facially invalid. Today\u2019s decision does not endorse the\nCourt of Appeals\u2019 reasoning, but it nevertheless strikes down \u00a748\nusing what has been aptly termed the \u201cstrong medicine\u201d of the\noverbreadth doctrine,United Statesv.Williams,553 U. S. 285,\n293 (2008) (internal quotation marks omitted), a potion that\ngenerally should be administered only as \u201ca last resort.\u201dLos\nAngeles Police Dept.v.United Reporting Publishing\nCorp.,528 U. S.\n32, 39 (1999) (internal quotation marks omitted).Instead of applying the doctrine of\noverbreadth, I would vacate the decision below and instruct the\nCourt of Appeals on remand to decide whether the videos that\nrespondent sold are constitutionally protected. If the question of\noverbreadth is to be decided, however, I do not think the present\nrecord supports the Court\u2019s conclusion that \u00a748 bans a substantial\nquantity of protected speech.IA party seeking to challenge the\nconstitutionality of a statute generally must show that the statute\nviolates the party\u2019s own rights.New Yorkv.Ferber,458 U. S. 747, 767 (1982). The First\nAmendment overbreadth doctrine carves out a narrow exception to\nthat general rule. Seeid., at 768;Broadrickv.Oklahoma,413 U. S. 601, 611\u2013612\n(1973). Because an overly broad law may deter constitutionally\nprotected speech, the overbreadth doctrine allows a party to whom\nthe law may constitutionally be applied to challenge the statute on\nthe ground that it violates the First Amendment rights of others.\nSee,e.g.,Board of Trustees of State Univ. of N.\nY.v.Fox,492 U. S. 469, 483\n(1989) (\u201cOrdinarily, the principal advantage of the overbreadth\ndoctrine for a litigant is that it enables him to benefit from the\nstatute\u2019s unlawful applicationto someone else\u201d); see alsoOhralikv.Ohio State Bar Assn.,436 U. S. 447, 462,\nn.\u00a020 (1978) (describing the doctrine as one \u201cunder which a\nperson may challenge a statute that infringes protected speech even\nif the statute constitutionally might be applied to him\u201d).The \u201cstrong medicine\u201d of\noverbreadth invalidation need not and generally should not be\nadministered when the statute under attack is unconstitutional as\napplied to the challenger before the court. As we said inFox,supra,at 484\u2013485, \u201c[i]t is not the usual\njudicial practice, \u2026 nor do we consider it generally desirable, to\nproceed to an overbreadth issue unnecessarily\u2014that is, before it is\ndetermined that the statute would be valid as applied.\u201d Accord,New York State Club Assn., Inc.v.City of New\nYork,487 U. S.\n1, 11 (1988); see alsoBroadrick,supra,at\n613;United Reporting Publishing Corp.,supra, at\n45 (Stevens, J., dissenting).I see no reason to depart here from the\ngenerally preferred procedure of considering the question of\noverbreadth only as a last resort.[Footnote 2] Because the Court has addressed the\noverbreadth question, however, I will explain why I do not think\nthat the record supports the conclusion that \u00a748, when properly\ninterpreted, is overly broad.IIThe overbreadth doctrine\n\u201cstrike[s] a balance between competing social costs.\u201dWilliams, 553 U. S., at 292. Specifically, the doctrine\nseeks to balance the \u201charmful effects\u201d of \u201cinvalidating a law that\nin some of its applications is perfectly constitutional\u201d against\nthe possibility that \u201cthe threat of enforcement of an overbroad law\n[will] dete[r] people from engaging in constitutionally protected\nspeech.\u201dIbid.\u201cIn order to maintain an appropriate\nbalance, we have vigorously enforced the requirement that a\nstatute\u2019s overbreadth besubstantial, not only in an\nabsolute sense, but also relative to the statute\u2019s plainly\nlegitimate sweep.\u201dIbid.In determining whether a\nstatute\u2019s overbreadth is substantial, we consider a statute\u2019s\napplication to real-world conduct, not fanciful hypotheticals. See,\ne.g.,id., at 301\u2013302; see alsoFerber,supra,at 773;Houstonv.Hill,482 U. S. 451, 466\u2013467\n(1987). Accordingly, we have repeatedly emphasized that an\noverbreadth claimant bears the burden of demonstrating, \u201cfrom the\ntext of [the law]and from actual fact,\u201d that substantial\noverbreadth exists.Virginiav.Hicks,539 U. S. 113, 122\n(2003) (quotingNew York State Club Assn.,supra,at 14; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted; alteration\nin original). Similarly, \u201cthere must be arealistic dangerthat the statute itself will significantly compromise recognized\nFirst Amendment protections of parties not before the Court for it\nto be facially challenged on overbreadth grounds.\u201dMembers of\nCity Council of Los Angelesv.Taxpayers for Vincent,466 U. S. 789,\n801 (1984) (emphasis added).IIIIn holding that \u00a748 violates the\noverbreadth rule, the Court declines to decide whether, as the\nGovernment maintains, \u00a748 is constitutional as applied to two broad\ncategories of depictions that exist in the real world: crush videos\nand depictions of deadly animal fights. Seeante, at 10,\n19. Instead, the Court tacitly assumes for the sake of argument\nthat \u00a748 is valid as applied to these depictions, but the Court\nconcludes that \u00a748 reaches too much protected speech to survive.\nThe Court relies primarily on depictions of hunters killing or\nwounding game and depictions of animals being slaughtered for food.\nI address the Court\u2019s examples below.AI turn first to depictions of\nhunting. As the Court notes, photographs and videos of hunters\nshooting game are common. Seeante,at 13\u201314. But hunting\nis legal in all 50 States, and \u00a748 applies only to a depiction of\nconduct that is illegal in the jurisdiction in which the depiction\nis created, sold, or possessed. \u00a7\u00a748(a), (c). Therefore, in all 50\nStates, the creation, sale, or possession for sale of the vast\nmajority of hunting depictions indisputably falls outside \u00a748\u2019s\nreach.Straining to find overbreadth, the Court\nsuggests that \u00a748 prohibits the sale or possession in the District\nof Columbia of any depiction of hunting because the\nDistrict\u2014undoubtedly because of its urban character\u2014does not permit\nhunting within its boundaries.Ante, at 13. The Court also\nsuggests that, because some States prohibit a particular type of\nhunting (e.g.,hunting with a crossbow or \u201ccanned\u201d\nhunting) or the hunting of a particular animal (e.g., the\n\u201csharp-tailed grouse\u201d), \u00a748 makes it illegal for persons in such\nStates to sell or possess for sale a depiction of hunting that was\nperfectly legal in the State in which the hunting took place. Seeante,at 12\u201314.The Court\u2019s interpretation is seriously\nflawed. \u201cWhen a federal court is dealing with a federal statute\nchallenged as overbroad, it should, of course, construe the statute\nto avoid constitutional problems, if the statute is subject to such\na limiting construction.\u201dFerber, 458 U. S., at 769,\nn.\u00a024. See alsoWilliams,supra,at 307\n(Stevens, J., concurring) (\u201c[T]o the extent the statutory text\nalone is unclear, our duty to avoid constitutional objections makes\nit especially appropriate to look beyond the text in order to\nascertain the intent of its drafters\u201d).Applying this canon, I would hold that \u00a748\ndoes not apply to depictions of hunting. First, because \u00a748 targets\ndepictions of \u201canimal cruelty,\u201d I would interpret that term to\napply only to depictions involving acts of animal cruelty as\ndefined by applicable state or federal law, not to depictions of\nacts that happen to be illegal for reasons having nothing to do\nwith the prevention of animal cruelty. Seeante, at 12\u201313\n(interpreting \u201c[t]he text of \u00a748(c)\u201d to ban a depiction of \u201cthe\nhumane slaughter of a stolen cow\u201d). Virtually all state laws\nprohibiting animal cruelty either expressly define the term\n\u201canimal\u201d to exclude wildlife or else specifically exempt lawful\nhunting activities,[Footnote 3]\nso the statutory prohibition set forth in \u00a748(a) may reasonably be\ninterpreted not to reach most if not all hunting depictions.Second, even if the hunting of wild animals\nwere otherwise covered by \u00a748(a), I would hold that hunting\ndepictions fall within the exception in \u00a748(b) for depictions that\nhave \u201cserious\u201d (i.e.,not \u201ctrifling\u201d[Footnote 4]) \u201cscientific,\u201d \u201ceducational,\u201d or\n\u201chistorical\u201d value. While there are certainly those who find\nhunting objectionable, the predominant view in this country has\nlong been that hunting serves many important values, and it is\nclear that Congress shares that view. Since 1972, when Congress\ncalled upon the President to designate a National Hunting and\nFishing Day, see S.\u00a0J. Res. 117, 92d Cong., 2d Sess. (1972),\n86 Stat. 133, Presidents have regularly issued proclamations\nextolling the values served by hunting. See Presidential\nProclamation No. 8421, 74 Fed. Reg. 49305 (Pres. Obama 2009)\n(hunting and fishing are \u201cageless pursuits\u201d that promote \u201cthe\nconservation and restoration of numerous species and their natural\nhabitats\u201d); Presidential Proclamation No. 8295, 73 Fed. Reg. 57233\n(Pres. Bush 2008) (hunters and anglers \u201cadd to our heritage and\nkeep our wildlife populations healthy and strong,\u201d and \u201care among\nour foremost conservationists\u201d); Presidential Proclamation No.\n7822, 69 Fed. Reg. 59539 (Pres. Bush 2004) (hunting and fishing are\n\u201can important part of our Nation\u2019s heritage,\u201d and \u201cAmerica\u2019s\nhunters and anglers represent the great spirit of our country\u201d);\nPresidential Proclamation No. 4682, 44 Fed. Reg. 53149 (Pres.\nCarter 1979) (hunting promotes conservation and an appreciation of\n\u201chealthy recreation, peaceful solitude and closeness to nature\u201d);\nPresidential Proclamation No. 4318, 39 Fed. Reg. 35315 (Pres. Ford\n1974) (hunting furthers \u201cappreciation and respect for nature\u201d and\npreservation of the environment). Thus, it is widely thought that\nhunting has \u201cscientific\u201d value in that it promotes conservation,\n\u201chistorical\u201d value in that it provides a link to past times when\nhunting played a critical role in daily life, and \u201ceducational\u201d\nvalue in that it furthers the understanding and appreciation of\nnature and our country\u2019s past and instills valuable character\ntraits. And if hunting itself is widely thought to serve these\nvalues, then it takes but a small additional step to conclude that\ndepictions of hunting make a non-trivial contribution to the\nexchange of ideas. Accordingly, I would hold that hunting\ndepictions fall comfortably within the exception set out in\n\u00a748(b).I do not have the slightest doubt that\nCongress, in enacting \u00a748, had no intention of restricting the\ncreation, sale, or possession of depictions of hunting. Proponents\nof the law made this point clearly. See H.\u00a0R. Rep. No.\n106\u2013397, p.\u00a08 (1999) (hereinafter H.\u00a0R. Rep.)\n(\u201c[D]epictions of ordinary hunting and fishing activities do not\nfall within the scope of the statute\u201d); 145 Cong. Rec. 25894 (Oct.\n19, 1999) (Rep. McCollum) (\u201c[T]he sale of depictions of legal\nactivities, such as hunting and fishing, would not be illegal under\nthis bill\u201d);id., at 25895 (Rep. Smith) (\u201c[L]et us be\nclear as to what this legislation will not do. It will in no way\nprohibit hunting, fishing, or wildlife videos\u201d). Indeed, evenopponentsacknowledged that \u00a748 was not intended to reach\nordinary hunting depictions. Seeibid.(Rep. Scott);id., at 25897 (Rep. Paul).For these reasons, I am convinced that \u00a748 has\nno application to depictions of hunting. But even if \u00a748 did\nimpermissibly reach the sale or possession of depictions of hunting\nin a few unusual situations (for example, the sale in Oregon of a\ndepiction of hunting with a crossbow in Virginia or the sale in\nWashington State of the hunting of a sharp-tailed grouse in Idaho,\nseeante, at 14), those isolated applications would hardly\nshow that \u00a748 bans a substantial amount of protected speech.BAlthough the Court\u2019s overbreadth\nanalysis rests primarily on the proposition that \u00a748 substantially\nrestricts the sale and possession of hunting depictions, the Court\ncites a few additional examples, including depictions of methods of\nslaughter and the docking of the tails of dairy cows. Seeante, at 14\u201315.Such examples do not show that\nthe statute is substantially overbroad, for two reasons. First, as\nexplained above, \u00a748 can reasonably be construed to apply only to\ndepictions involving acts of animal cruelty as defined by\napplicable state or federal law, and anti-cruelty laws do not ban\nthe sorts of acts depicted in the Court\u2019s hypotheticals. See,e.g., Idaho Code \u00a725\u20133514 (Lexis 2000) (\u201cNo part of this\nchapter [prohibiting cruelty to animals] shall be construed as\ninterfering with or allowing interference with \u2026 [t]he humane\nslaughter of any animal normally and commonly raised as food or for\nproduction of fiber \u2026 [or] [n]ormal or accepted practices of \u2026\nanimal husbandry\u201d); Kan. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 21\u20134310(b) (2007) (\u201cThe\nprovisions of this section shall not apply to \u2026 with respect to\nfarm animals, normal or accepted practices of animal husbandry,\nincluding the normal and accepted practices for the slaughter of\nsuch animals\u201d); Md. Crim. Law Code Ann. \u00a710\u2013603 (Lexis 2002)\n(sections prohibiting animal cruelty \u201cdo not apply to \u2026 customary\nand normal veterinary and agricultural husbandry practices,\nincluding dehorning, castration, tail docking, and limit\nfeeding\u201d).Second, nothing in the record suggests that\nany one has ever created, sold, or possessed for sale a depiction\nof the slaughter of food animals or of the docking of the tails of\ndairy cows that would not easily qualify under the exception set\nout in \u00a748(b). Depictions created to show proper methods of\nslaughter or tail-docking would presumably have serious\n\u201ceducational\u201d value, and depictions created to focus attention on\nmethods thought to be inhumane or otherwise objectionable would\npresumably have either serious \u201ceducational\u201d or \u201cjournalistic\u201d\nvalue or both. In short, the Court\u2019s examples of depictions\ninvolving the docking of tails and humane slaughter do not show\nthat \u00a748 suffers from any overbreadth, much less substantial\noverbreadth.The Court notes, finally, that cockfighting,\nwhich is illegal in all States, is still legal in Puerto Rico,ante, at 15, and I take the Court\u2019s point to be that it\nwould be impermissible to ban the creation, sale, or possession in\nPuerto Rico of a depiction of a cockfight that was legally staged\nin Puerto Rico.[Footnote 5] But\nassuming for the sake of argument that this is correct, this\nveritable sliver of unconstitutionality would not be enough to\njustify striking down \u00a748in toto.In sum, we have a duty to interpret \u00a748 so as\nto avoid serious constitutional concerns, and \u00a748 may reasonably be\nconstrued not to reach almost all, if not all, of the depictions\nthat the Court finds constitutionally protected. Thus, \u00a748 does not\nappear to have a large number of unconstitutional applications.\nInvalidation for overbreadth is appropriate only if the challenged\nstatute suffers fromsubstantialoverbreadth\u2014judged not\njust in absolute terms, but in relation to the statute\u2019s \u201cplainly\nlegitimate sweep.\u201dWilliams, 553 U. S., at 292. As I\nexplain in the following Part, \u00a748 has a substantial core of\nconstitutionally permissible applications.IVA1As the Court of Appeals\nrecognized, \u201cthe primary conduct that Congress sought to address\nthrough its passage [of \u00a748] was the creation, sale, or possession\nof \u2018crush videos.\u2019\u00a0\u201d 533 F.\u00a03d 218, 222 (CA3 2008) (en\nbanc). A sample crush video, which has been lodged with the Clerk,\nrecords the following event:\u201c[A] kitten, secured to the ground, watches and\nshrieks in pain as a woman thrusts her high-heeled shoe into its\nbody, slams her heel into the kitten\u2019s eye socket and mouth loudly\nfracturing its skull, and stomps repeatedly on the animal\u2019s head.\nThe kitten hemorrhages blood, screams blindly in pain, and is\nultimately left dead in a moist pile of blood-soaked hair and\nbone.\u201d Brief for Humane Society of United States asAmicus\nCuriae2 (hereinafter Humane Society Brief).It is undisputed that theconductdepicted in crush videos may constitutionally be\nprohibited. All 50 States and the District of Columbia have enacted\nstatutes prohibiting animal cruelty. See 533 F.\u00a03d,at 223, and n.\u00a04 (citing statutes); H.\u00a0R. Rep., at 3. But\nbefore the enactment of \u00a748, the underlying conduct depicted in\ncrush videos was nearly impossible to prosecute. These videos,\nwhich \u201c\u00a0often appeal to persons with a very specific sexual\nfetish,\u201did., at 2, were made in secret, generally without\na live audience, and \u201cthe faces of the women inflicting the torture\nin the material often were not shown, nor could the location of the\nplace where the cruelty was being inflicted or the date of the\nactivity be ascertained from the depiction.\u201dId., at 3.\nThus, law enforcement authorities often were not able to identify\nthe parties responsible for the torture. See Punishing Depictions\nof Animal Cruelty and the Federal Prisoner Health Care Co-Payment\nAct of 1999: Hearing before the Subcommittee on Crime of the House\nCommittee on the Judiciary, 106th Cong., 1st Sess., p.\u00a01\n(1999) (hereinafter Hearing on Depictions of Animal Cruelty). In\nthe rare instances in which it was possible to identify and find\nthe perpetrators, they \u201coften were able to successfully assert as a\ndefense that the State could not prove its jurisdiction over the\nplace where the act occurred or that the actions depicted took\nplace within the time specified in the State statute of\nlimitations.\u201d H.\u00a0R. Rep., at 3;see also 145 Cong.\nRec. 25896 (Rep. Gallegly) (\u201c[I]t is the prosecutors from around\nthis country, Federal prosecutors as well as State prosecutors,\nthat have made an appeal to us for this\u201d); Hearing on Depictions of\nAnimal Cruelty 21 (\u201cIf the production of the video is not\ndiscovered during the actual filming, then prosecution for the\noffense is virtually impossible without a cooperative eyewitness to\nthe filming or an undercover police operation\u201d);id., at\n34\u201335 (discussing example of case in which state prosecutor \u201chad\nthe defendant telling us he produced these videos,\u201d but where\nprosecution was not possible because the State could not prove\nwhere or when the tape was made).In light of the practical problems thwarting\nthe prosecution of the creators of crush videos under state animal\ncruelty laws, Congress concluded that the only effective way of\nstopping the underlying criminal conduct was to prohibit the\ncommercial exploitation of the videos of that conduct. And\nCongress\u2019 strategy appears to have been vindicated. We are told\nthat \u201c[b]y 2007, sponsors of \u00a748 declared the crush video industry\ndead. Even overseas Websites shut down in the wake of \u00a748. Now,\nafter the Third Circuit\u2019s decision [facially invalidating the\nstatute], crush videos are already back online.\u201d Humane Society\nBrief 5 (citations omitted).2The First Amendment protects\nfreedom of speech, but it most certainly does not protect violent\ncriminal conduct, even if engaged in for expressive purposes. Crush\nvideos present a highly unusual free speech issue because they are\nso closely linked with violent criminal conduct. The videos record\nthe commission of violent criminal acts, and it appears that these\ncrimes are committed for the sole purpose of creating the videos.\nIn addition, as noted above, Congress was presented with compelling\nevidence that the only way of preventing these crimes was to target\nthe sale of the videos. Under these circumstances, I cannot believe\nthat the First Amendment commands Congress to step aside and allow\nthe underlying crimes to continue.The most relevant of our prior\ndecisions isFerber,458 U. S. 747, which concerned child\npornography. The Court there held that child pornography is not\nprotected speech, and I believe thatFerber\u2019s reasoning\ndictates a similar conclusion here.InFerber,an important factor\u2014I\nwould say the most important factor\u2014was that child pornography\ninvolves the commission of a crime that inflicts severe personal\ninjury to the \u201cchildren who are made to engage in sexual conduct\nfor commercial purposes.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId.,at 753 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). TheFerberCourt repeatedly\ndescribed the production of child pornography as child \u201cabuse,\u201d\n\u201cmolestation,\u201d or \u201cexploitation.\u201d See,e.g.,id.,\nat 749 (\u201cIn recent years, the exploitive use of children in the\nproduction of pornography has become a serious national problem\u201d);id., at 758, n.\u00a09 (\u201cSexual molestation by adults is\noften involved in the production of child sexual performances\u201d). As\nlater noted inAshcroftv.Free Speech Coalition,535 U. S. 234,\n249 (2002), inFerber\u201c[t]he production of the work, not\nits content, was the target of the statute.\u201d See also 535 U.S., at\n250 (Ferberinvolved \u201cspeech that itself is the record of\nsexual abuse\u201d).Second,Ferberemphasized the fact\nthat these underlying crimes could not be effectively combated\nwithout targeting the distribution of child pornography. As the\nCourt put it, \u201cthe distribution network for child pornography must\nbe closed if the production of material which requires the sexual\nexploitation of children is to be effectively controlled.\u201d 458 U.\nS., at 759. The Court added:\u201c[T]here is no serious contention that the\nlegislature was unjustified in believing that it is difficult, if\nnot impossible, to halt the exploitation of children by pursuing\nonly those who produce the photographs and movies\u2026\u00a0. The most\nexpeditious if not the only practical method of law enforcement may\nbe to dry up the market for this material by imposing severe\ncriminal penalties on persons selling, advertising, or otherwise\npromoting the product.\u201dId., at 759\u2013760.See alsoid., at 761 (\u201cThe advertising and\nselling of child pornography provide an economic motive for and are\nthus an integral part of the production of such materials\u201d).Third, theFerberCourt noted that\nthe value of child pornography \u201cis exceedingly modest, if notde minimis,\u201dand that any such value was \u201coverwhelmingly\noutweigh[ed]\u201d by \u201cthe evil to be restricted.\u201dId., at\n762\u2013763.All three of these characteristics are shared\nby \u00a748, as applied to crush videos. First, the conduct depicted in\ncrush videos is criminal in every State and the District of\nColumbia. Thus, any crush video made in this country records the\nactual commission of a criminal act that inflicts severe physical\ninjury and excruciating pain and ultimately results in death. Those\nwho record the underlying criminal acts are likely to be criminally\nculpable, either as aiders and abettors or conspirators. And in the\ntight and secretive market for these videos, some who sell the\nvideos or possess them with the intent to make a profit may be\nsimilarly culpable. (For example, in some cases, crush videos were\ncommissioned by purchasers who specified the details of the acts\nthat they wanted to see performed. See H.\u00a0R. Rep., at 3;\nHearing on Depictions of Animal Cruelty 27). To the extent that \u00a748\nreaches such persons, it surely does not violate the First\nAmendment.Second, the criminal acts shown in crush\nvideos cannot be prevented without targeting the conduct prohibited\nby \u00a748\u2014the creation, sale, and possession for sale of depictions of\nanimal torture with the intention of realizing a commercial profit.\nThe evidence presented to Congress posed a stark choice: Either ban\nthe commercial exploitation of crush videos or tolerate a\ncontinuation of the criminal acts that they record. Faced with this\nevidence, Congress reasonably chose to target the lucrative crush\nvideo market.Finally, the harm caused by the underlying\ncrimes vastly outweighs any minimal value that the depictions might\nconceivably be thought to possess. Section 48 reaches only the\nactual recording of acts of animal torture; the statute does not\napply to verbal descriptions or to simulations. And, unlike the\nchild pornography statute inFerberor its federal\ncounterpart, 18 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a72252, \u00a748(b) provides an exception\nfor depictions having any \u201cserious religious, political,\nscientific, educational, journalistic, historical, or artistic\nvalue.\u201dIt must be acknowledged that \u00a748 differs from\na child pornography law in an important respect: preventing the\nabuse of children is certainly much more important than preventing\nthe torture of the animals used in crush videos. It was largely for\nthis reason that the Court of Appeals concluded thatFerberdid not support the constitutionality of \u00a748. 533\nF.\u00a03d, at 228 (\u201cPreventing cruelty to animals, although an\nexceedingly worthy goal, simply does not implicate interests of the\nsame magnitude as protecting children from physical and\npsychological harm\u201d). But while protecting children is\nunquestionablymoreimportant than protecting animals, the\nGovernment also has a compelling interest in preventing the torture\ndepicted in crush videos.The animals used in crush videos are living\ncreatures that experience excruciating pain. Our society has long\nbanned such cruelty, which is illegal throughout the country. InFerber, the Court noted that \u201cvirtually all of the States\nand the United States have passed legislation proscribing the\nproduction of or otherwise combating \u2018child pornography,\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nand the Court declined to \u201csecond-guess [that] legislative\njudgment.\u201d[Footnote 6] 458 U.\nS., at 758. Here, likewise, the Court of Appeals erred in\nsecond-guessing the legislative judgment about the importance of\npreventing cruelty to animals.Section 48\u2019s ban on trafficking in crush\nvideos also helps to enforce the criminal laws and to ensure that\ncriminals do not profit from their crimes. See 145 Cong. Rec. 25897\n(Oct. 19, 1999) (Rep. Gallegly) (\u201cThe state has an interest in\nenforcing its existing laws. Right now, the laws are not only being\nviolated, but people are making huge profits from promoting the\nviolations\u201d);id.,at 10685 (May 24, 1999) (Rep. Gallegly)\n(explaining that he introduced the House version of the bill\nbecause \u201ccriminals should not profit from [their] illegal acts\u201d).\nWe have already judged that taking the profit out of crime is a\ncompelling interest. SeeSimon & Schuster, Inc.v.Members of N.\u00a0Y. State Crime Victims Bd.,502 U. S. 105, 119 (1991).In short,Ferberis the case that\nsheds the most light on the constitutionality of Congress\u2019 effort\nto halt the production of crush videos. Applying the principles set\nforth inFerber, I would hold that crush videos are not\nprotected by the First Amendment.BApplication of theFerberframework also supports the constitutionality of\n\u00a748 as applied to depictions of brutal animal fights. (For\nconvenience, I will focus on videos of dogfights, which appear to\nbe the most common type of animal fight videos.)First, such depictions,\nlike crush videos, record the actual commission of a crime\ninvolving deadly violence. Dogfights are illegal in every State and\nthe District of Columbia, Brief for United States 26\u201327, and\nn.\u00a08 (citing statutes), and under federal law constitute a\nfelony punishable by imprisonment for up to five years, 7 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a72156etseq.(2006 ed. and Supp. II),\n18 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a749 (2006 ed., Supp. II).Second, Congress had an ample basis for\nconcluding that the crimes depicted in these videos cannot be\neffectively controlled without targeting the videos. Like crush\nvideos and child pornography, dogfight videos are very often\nproduced as part of a \u201clow-profile, clandestine industry,\u201d and \u201cthe\nneed to market the resulting products requires a visible apparatus\nof distribution.\u201dFerber,458 U. S., at 760. In such\ncircumstances, Congress had reasonable grounds for concluding that\nit would be \u201cdifficult, if not impossible, to halt\u201d the underlying\nexploitation of dogs by pursuing only those who stage the fights.Id., at 759\u2013760; see 533 F.\u00a03d, at 246 (Cowen, J.,\ndissenting) (citing evidence establishing \u201cthe existence of a\nlucrative market for depictions of animal cruelty,\u201d including\nvideos of dogfights, \u201cwhich in turn provides a powerful incentive\nto individuals to create [such] videos\u201d).The commercial trade in videos of dogfights is\n\u201can integral part of the production of such materials,\u201dFerber,\nsupra,at 761. As the Humane Society explains, \u201c[v]ideotapes\nmemorializing dogfights are integral to the success of this\ncriminal industry\u201d for a variety of reasons. Humane Society Brief\n5. For one thing, some dogfighting videos are made \u201csolely for the\npurpose of selling the video (and not for a live audience).\u201dId., at 9. In addition, those who stage dogfights profit\nnot just from the sale of the videos themselves, but from the\ngambling revenue they take in from the fights; the videos\n\u201cencourage [such] gambling activity because they allow those\nreluctant to attend actual fights for fear of prosecution to still\nbet on the outcome.\u201dIbid.;accord, Brief for Center on\nthe Administration of Criminal Law asAmicus Curiae12\n(\u201cSelling videos of dogfights effectively abets the underlying\ncrimes by providing a market for dogfighting while allowing actual\ndogfights to remain underground\u201d);ibid.(\u201cThese videos\nare part of a \u2018lucrative market\u2019 where videos are produced by a\n\u2018bare-boned, clandestine staff\u2019 in order to permit the actual\nlocation of dogfights and the perpetrators of these underlying\ncriminal activities to go undetected\u201d (citations omitted)).\nMoreover, \u201c[v]ideo documentation is vital to the criminal\nenterprise because it providesproofof a dog\u2019s fighting\nprowess\u2014proof demanded by potential buyers and critical to the\nunderground market.\u201d Humane Society Brief 9. Such recordings may\nalso serve as \u201c\u00a0\u2018training\u2019 videos for other fight organizers.\u201dIbid.In short, because videos depicting live dogfights\nare essential to the success of the criminal dogfighting\nsubculture, the commercial sale of such videos helps to fuel the\nmarket for, and thus to perpetuate the perpetration of, the\ncriminal conduct depicted in them.Third, depictions of dogfights that fall\nwithin \u00a748\u2019s reach have by definition no appreciable social value.\nAs noted, \u00a748(b) exempts depictions having any appreciable social\nvalue, and thus the mere inclusion of a depiction of a live fight\nin a larger work that aims at communicating an idea or a message\nwith a modicum of social value would not run afoul of the\nstatute.Finally, the harm caused by the underlying\ncriminal acts greatly outweighs any trifling value that the\ndepictions might be thought to possess. As the Humane Society\nexplains:\u201cThe abused dogs used in fights endure physical\ntorture and emotional manipulation throughout their lives to\npredispose them to violence; common tactics include feeding the\nanimals hot peppers and gunpowder, prodding them with sticks, and\nelectrocution. Dogs are conditioned never to give up a fight, even\nif they will be gravely hurt or killed. As a result, dogfights\ninflict horrific injuries on the participating animals, including\nlacerations, ripped ears, puncture wounds and broken bones. Losing\ndogs are routinely refused treatment, beaten further as\n\u2018punishment\u2019 for the loss, and executed by drowning, hanging, or\nincineration.\u201dId.,at 5\u20136 (footnotes omitted).For these dogs, unlike the\nanimals killed in crush videos, the suffering lasts for years\nrather than minutes. As with crush videos, moreover, the statutory\nban on commerce in dogfighting videos is also supported by\ncompelling governmental interests in effectively enforcing the\nNation\u2019s criminal laws and preventing criminals from profiting from\ntheir illegal activities. SeeFerber,supra, at\n757\u2013758;Simon & Schuster, 502 U. S., at 119.In sum, \u00a748 may validly be applied to at least\ntwo broad real-world categories of expression covered by the\nstatute: crush videos and dogfighting videos. Thus, the statute has\na substantial core of constitutionally permissible applications.\nMoreover, for the reasons set forth above, the record does not show\nthat \u00a748, properly interpreted, bans a substantial amount of\nprotected speech in absolute terms.A fortiori, respondent\nhas not met his burden of demonstrating that any impermissible\napplications of the statute are \u201csubstantial\u201d in relation to its\n\u201cplainly legitimate sweep.\u201dWilliams, 553 U. S., at 292.\nAccordingly, I would reject respondent\u2019s claim that \u00a748 is facially\nunconstitutional under the overbreadth doctrine.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*For these reasons, I respectfully\ndissent.APPENDIXAs the following chart makes clear, virtually\nall state laws prohibiting animal cruelty either expressly define\nthe term \u201canimal\u201d to exclude wildlife or else specifically exempt\nlawful hunting activities.AlaskaAlaska Stat. \u00a711.61.140(c)(4) (2008) (\u201cIt is a defense to a\nprosecution under this section that the conduct of the defendant \u2026\nwas necessarily incidental to lawful fishing, hunting or trapping\nactivities\u201d)ArizonaAriz.

Va. Code Ann. \u00a761\u20138\u201319(f) (Lexis Supp. 2009) (\u201cThe provisions\nof this section do not apply to lawful acts of hunting, fishing,\n[or] trapping\u201d)WisconsinWis. Stat. \u00a7951.015(1) (2007\u20132008) (\u201cThis chapter may not be\ninterpreted as controverting any law regulating wild animals that\nare subject to regulation under ch. 169 [regulating, among other\nthings, hunting], [or] the taking of wild animals\u201d)WyomingWyo. Stat. Ann. \u00a76\u20133\u2013203(m)(iv) (2009) (\u201cNothing in subsection\n(a), (b) or (n) of this section shall be construed to prohibit \u2026\n[t]he hunting, capture or destruction of any predatory animal or\nother wildlife in any manner not otherwise prohibited by law\u201d)Footnote 1Respondent argued at length that the evidence\nwas insufficient to prove that the particular videos he sold lacked\nany serious scientific, educational, or historical value and thus\nfell outside the exception in \u00a748(b). See Brief for Appellant in\nNo. 05\u20132497 (CA3), pp.\u00a072\u201379. He added that, if the evidence\nin this case was held to be sufficient to take his videos outside\nthe scope of the exception, then \u201cthis case presents \u2026 a situation\u201d\nin which \u201ca constitutional violation occurs.\u201dId., at 71.\nSee alsoid., at 47 (\u201cThe applicability of 18 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a748 to speech which is not a crush video or an appeal to\nsome prurient sexual interest constitutes a restriction of\nprotected speech, and an unwarranted violation of the First\nAmendment\u2019s free speech guarantee\u201d); Brief for Respondent 55\n(\u201cStevens\u2019 speech does not fit within any existing category of\nunprotected, prosecutable speech\u201d);id., at 57 (\u201c[T]he\nrecord as a whole demonstrates that Stevens\u2019 speech cannot\nconstitutionally be punished\u201d). Contrary to the Court,ante,at 10\u201311, n.\u00a03 (citing 533 F.\u00a03d 218, 231,\nn.\u00a013 (CA3 2008) (en banc)), I see no suggestion in the\nopinion of the Court of Appeals that respondent did not preserve an\nas-applied challenge.Footnote 2For the reasons set forth below, this is not a case\nin which the challenged statute is unconstitutional in all or\nalmost all of its applications.Footnote 3See Appendix,infra(citing\nstatutes); B. Wagman, S. Waisman, & P. Frasch, Animal Law:\nCases and Materials 92 (4th ed. 2010) (\u201cMost anti-cruelty laws also\ninclude one or more exemptions,\u201d which often \u201cexclud[e] from\ncoverage (1) whole classes of animals, such as wildlife or farm\nanimals, or (2) specific activities, such as hunting\u201d); Note,\nEconomics and Ethics in the Genetic Engineering of Animals, 19\nHarv. J.\u00a0L. & Tech. 413, 432 (2006) (\u201cNot surprisingly,\nstate laws relating to the humane treatment of wildlife, including\ndeer, elk, and waterfowl, are virtually non-existent\u201d).Footnote 4Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary\n2073 (1976); Random House Dictionary of the English Language 1303\n(1966). While the term \u201cserious\u201d may also mean \u201cweighty\u201d or\n\u201cimportant,\u201dibid., we should adopt the former definition\nif necessary to avoid unconstitutionality.Footnote 5Since the Court has taken pains not to decide\nwhether \u00a748 would be unconstitutional as applied to graphic\ndogfight videos, including those depicting fights occurring in\ncountries where dogfighting is legal, I take it that the Court does\nnot intend for its passing reference to cockfights to mean either\nthat all depictions of cockfights, whether legal or illegal under\nlocal law, are protected by the First Amendment or that it is\nimpermissible to ban the sale or possession in the States of a\ndepiction of a legal cockfight in Puerto Rico.Footnote 6In other cases, we have regarded evidence of\na national consensus as proof that a particular government interest\nis compelling.
