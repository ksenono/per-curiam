CANIGLIA, PETITIONERv.ROBERT F. STROM, et\u00a0al.on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the first circuit[May 17, 2021]Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the\nCourt.Decades ago, this Court held that a warrantless\nsearch of an impounded vehicle for an unsecured firearm did not\nviolate the Fourth Amendment.Cadyv.Dombrowski,413 U.S.\n433(1973). In reaching this conclusion, the Court observed\nthat police officers who patrol the \u201cpublic highways\u201d are often\ncalled to discharge noncriminal \u201ccommunity caretaking functions,\u201d\nsuch as responding to disabled vehicles or investigating accidents.Id., at 441. The question today is whetherCady\u2019s\nacknowledgment of these \u201ccaretaking\u201d duties creates a standalone\ndoctrine that justifies warrantless searches and seizures in the\nhome. It does not.IDuring an argument with his wife at their\nRhode Island home, Edward Caniglia (petitioner) retrieved a handgun\nfrom the bedroom, put it on the dining room table, and asked his\nwife to \u201cshoot [him] now and get it over with.\u201d She declined, and\ninstead left to spend the night at a hotel. The next morning, when\npetitioner\u2019s wife discovered that she could not reach him by\ntelephone, she called the police (respondents) to request a welfare\ncheck.Respondents accompanied petitioner\u2019s wife to the\nhome, where they encountered petitioner on the porch. Petitioner\nspoke with respondents and confirmed his wife\u2019s account of the\nargument, but denied that he was suicidal. Respondents, however,\nthought that petitioner posed a risk to himself or others. They\ncalled an ambulance, and petitioner agreed to go to the hospital\nfor a psychiatric evaluation\u2014but only after respondents allegedly\npromised not to confiscate his firearms. Once the ambulance had\ntaken petitioner away, however, respondents seized the weapons.\nGuided by petitioner\u2019s wife\u2014whom they allegedly misinformed about\nhis wishes\u2014respondents entered the home and took two handguns.Petitioner sued, claiming that respondents\nviolated the Fourth Amendment when they entered his home and seized\nhim and his firearms without a warrant. The District Court granted\nsummary judgment to respondents, and the First Circuit affirmed\nsolely on the ground that the decision to remove petitioner and his\nfirearms from the premises fell within a \u201ccommunity caretaking\nexception\u201d to the warrant requirement. 953 F.3d 112, 121\u2013123, 131\nand nn.\u00a05, 9 (2020). Citing this Court\u2019s statement inCadythat police officers often have noncriminal reasons to\ninteract with motorists on \u201cpublic highways,\u201d 413 U.\u00a0S., at\n441, the First Circuit extrapolated a freestanding\ncommunity-caretaking exception that applies to both cars and homes.\n953 F.\u00a03d, at 124 (\u201cThreats to individual and community safety\nare not confined to the highways\u201d). Accordingly, the First Circuit\nsaw no need to consider whether anyone had consented to\nrespondents\u2019 actions; whether these actions were justified by\n\u201cexigent circumstances\u201d; or whether any state law permitted this\nkind of mental-health intervention.Id.,at 122\u2013123. All\nthat mattered was that respondents\u2019 efforts to protect petitioner\nand those around him were \u201cdistinct from \u2018the normal work of\ncriminal investigation,\u2019\u00a0\u201d fell \u201cwithin the realm of reason,\u201d\nand generally tracked what the court viewed to be \u201csound police\nprocedure.\u201dId.,at 123\u2013128, 132\u2013133. We granted certiorari.\n592 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2020).IIThe Fourth Amendment protects \u201c[t]he right of\nthe people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and\neffects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.\u201d The\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018very core\u2019\u00a0\u201d of this guarantee is \u201c\u00a0\u2018the right of\na man to retreat into his own home and there be free from\nunreasonable governmental intrusion.\u2019\u00a0\u201dFloridav.Jardines,569 U.S.\n1, 6 (2013).To be sure, the Fourth Amendment does not\nprohibit all unwelcome intrusions \u201con private property,\u201dibid.\u2014only \u201cunreasonable\u201d ones. We have thus recognized a\nfew permissible invasions of the home and its curtilage. Perhaps\nmost familiar, for example, are searches and seizures pursuant to a\nvalid warrant. SeeCollinsv.Virginia, 584\nU.\u00a0S. ___, ___\u2013___ (2018) (slip op., at 5\u20136). We have also\nheld that law enforcement officers may enter private property\nwithout a warrant when certain exigent circumstances exist,\nincluding the need to \u201c\u00a0\u2018render emergency assistance to an\ninjured occupant or to protect an occupant from imminent\ninjury.\u2019\u00a0\u201dKentuckyv.King,563 U.S.\n452, 460, 470 (2011); see alsoBrigham Cityv.Stuart,547 U.S.\n398, 403\u2013404 (2006) (listing other examples of exigent\ncircumstances). And, of course, officers may generally take actions\nthat \u201c\u00a0\u2018any private citizen might do\u2019\u00a0\u201d without fear of\nliability.E.g.,Jardines, 569 U.\u00a0S., at 8\n(approaching a home and knocking on the front door).The First Circuit\u2019s \u201ccommunity caretaking\u201d rule,\nhowever, goes beyond anything this Court has recognized. The\ndecision below assumed that respondents lacked a warrant or\nconsent, and it expressly disclaimed the possibility that they were\nreacting to a crime. The court also declined to consider whether\nany recognized exigent circumstances were present because\nrespondents had forfeited the point. Nor did it find that\nrespondents\u2019 actions were akin to what a private citizen might have\nhad authority to do if petitioner\u2019s wife had approached a neighbor\nfor assistance instead of the police.Neither the holding nor logic ofCadyjustified that approach. True,Cadyalso involved a\nwarrantless search for a firearm. But the location of that search\nwas an impounded vehicle\u2014not a home\u2014\u201c\u00a0\u2018a constitutional\ndifference\u2019\u00a0\u201d that the opinion repeatedly stressed. 413\nU.\u00a0S., at 439; see alsoid.,at 440\u2013442. In fact,Cadyexpressly contrasted its treatment of a vehicle already\nunder police control with a search of a car \u201cparked adjacent to the\ndwelling place of the owner.\u201dId., at 446\u2013448 (citingCoolidgev.New Hampshire,403\nU.S. 443(1971)).Cady\u2019s unmistakable distinction between\nvehicles and homes also places into proper context its reference to\n\u201ccommunity caretaking.\u201d This quote comes from a portion of the\nopinion explaining that the \u201cfrequency with which\n.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0vehicle[s] can become disabled or involved in\n.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0accident[s] on public highways\u201d often requires\npolice to perform noncriminal \u201ccommunity caretaking functions,\u201d\nsuch as providing aid to motorists. 413 U.\u00a0S., at 441. But,\nthis recognition that police officers perform many civic tasks in\nmodern society was just that\u2014a recognition that these tasks exist,\nand not an open-ended license to perform them anywhere.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*What is reasonable for vehicles is different\nfrom what is reasonable for homes.Cadyacknowledged as\nmuch, and this Court has repeatedly \u201cdeclined to expand the scope\nof .\u00a0.\u00a0. exceptions to the warrant requirement to permit\nwarrantless entry into the home.\u201dCollins, 584 U.\u00a0S.,\nat ___ (slip op., at 8). We thus vacate the judgment below and\nremand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.",
