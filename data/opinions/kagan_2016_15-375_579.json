The\nquestion pre-sented here is whether a court, in exercising that\nauthor-ity, should give substantial weight to the objective\nreasonableness of the losing party\u2019s position. The answer, as both\ndecisions below held, is yes\u2014the court should. But the court must\nalso give due consideration to all other circumstances relevant to\ngranting fees; and it retains discretion, in light of those\nfactors, to make an award even when the losing party advanced a\nreasonable claim or defense. Because we are not certain that the\nlower courts here understood the full scope of that discretion, we\nreturn the case for further consideration of the prevailing party\u2019s\nfee application.IPetitioner Supap Kirtsaeng, a citizen of\nThailand, came to the United States 20 years ago to study math at\nCornell University. He quickly figured out that respondent John\nWiley & Sons, an academic publishing company, sold virtually\nidentical English-language textbooks in the two countries\u2014but for\nfar less in Thailand than in the United States. Seeing a ripe\nopportunity for arbitrage, Kirtsaeng asked family and friends to\nbuy the foreign editions in Thai bookstores and ship them to him in\nNew York. He then resold the textbooks to American students,\nreimbursed his Thai suppliers, and pocketed a tidy profit.Wiley sued Kirtsaeng for copyright infringement,\nclaiming that his activities violated its exclusive right to\ndistribute the textbooks. See 17 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a7106(3),\n602(a)(1). Kirtsaeng invoked the \u201cfirst-sale doctrine\u201d as a\ndefense. That doctrine typically enables the lawful owner of a book\n(or other work) to resell or otherwise dispose of it as he wishes.\nSee \u00a7109(a). But Wiley contended that the first-sale doctrine did\nnot apply when a book (like those Kirtsaeng sold) was manufactured\nabroad.At the time, courts were in conflict on that\nissue. Some thought, as Kirtsaeng did, that the first-sale doctrine\npermitted the resale of foreign-made books; others maintained,\nalong with Wiley, that it did not. And this Court, in its first\npass at the issue, divided 4 to 4. SeeCostco Wholesale\nCorp.v.Omega, S.A., 562 U.\u00a0S. 40\n(2010) (per curiam). In this case, the District Court\nsided with Wiley; so too did a divided panel of the Court of\nAppeals for the Second Circuit. See 654 F.\u00a03d 210, 214, 222\n(2011). To settle the continuing conflict, this Court granted\nKirtsaeng\u2019s petition for certiorari and reversed the Second Circuit\nin a 6-to-3 decision, thus establishing that the first-sale\ndoctrine allows the resale of foreign-made books, just as it does\ndomestic ones. SeeKirtsaengv.John Wiley & Sons,\nInc., 568 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 3).Returning victorious to the District Court,\nKirtsaeng invoked \u00a7505 to seek more than $2 million in attorney\u2019s\nfees from Wiley. The court denied his motion. Relying on Second\nCircuit precedent, the court gave \u201csubstantial weight\u201d to the\n\u201cobjective reasonableness\u201d of Wiley\u2019s infringement claim. See No.\n08\u2013cv\u201307834 (SDNY, Dec. 20, 2013), App. to Pet. for Cert. 18a, 2013\nWL 6722887, *4. In explanation of that approach, the court stated\nthat \u201cthe imposition of a fee award against a copyright holder with\nan objectively reasonable\u201d\u2014although unsuccessful\u2014\u201clit-igation\nposition will generally not promote the purposes of the Copyright\nAct.\u201dId.,at 11a (quotingMatthew Bender & Co.v.West Publishing Co., 240 F.\u00a03d 116, 122 (CA2 2001)\n(emphasis deleted)). Here, Wiley\u2019s position was reasonable: After\nall, several Courts of Appeals and three Justices of the Supreme\nCourt had agreed with it. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 12a. And\naccording to the District Court, no other circumstance \u201coverr[o]de\u201d\nthat objective reasonableness, so as to warrant fee-shifting.Id., at 22a. The Court of Appeals affirmed, concluding in a\nbrief summary order that \u201cthe district court properly placed\n\u2018substantial weight\u2019 on the reasonableness of [Wiley\u2019s] position\u201d\nand committed no abuse of discretion in deciding that other\n\u201cfactors did not outweigh\u201d the reasonableness finding. 605 Fed.\nAppx. 48, 49, 50 (CA2 2015).We granted certiorari, 577 U.\u00a0S. ___\n(2016), to resolve disagreement in the lower courts about how to\naddress an application for attorney\u2019s fees in a copyright\ncase.[1]IISection 505 states that a district court \u201cmay\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. award a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee to the prevailing\nparty.\u201d It thus authorizes fee-shifting, but without specifying\nstandards that courts should adopt, or guideposts they should use,\nin determining when such awards are appropriate.InFogertyv.Fantasy, Inc., 510\nU.\u00a0S. 517 (1994) , this Court recognized the broad leeway \u00a7505\ngives to district courts\u2014but also established several principles\nand criteria to guide their decisions. Seeid.,at 519\n(asking \u201cwhat standards should inform\u201d the exercise of the trial\ncourt\u2019s authority). The statutory language, we stated, \u201cclearly\nconnotes discretion,\u201d and eschews any \u201cprecise rule or formula\u201d for\nawarding fees.Id.,at 533, 534. Still, we established a\npair of restrictions. First, a district court may not\n\u201caward[\u00a0] attorney\u2019s fees as a matter of course\u201d; rather, a\ncourt must make a more particularized, case-by-case assessment.Id.,at 533. Second, a court may not treat prevailing\nplaintiffs and prevailing defendants any differently; defendants\nshould be \u201cencouraged to litigate [meritorious copyright defenses]\nto the same extent that plaintiffs are encouraged to litigate\nmeritorious claims of infringement.\u201dId.,at 527. In\naddition, we noted with approval \u201cseveral nonexclusive factors\u201d to\ninform a court\u2019s fee-shifting decisions: \u201cfrivolousness,\nmotivation, objective unreasonableness[,] and the need in\nparticular circumstances to advance considerations of compensation\nand deterrence.\u201dId., at 534, n. 19. And we left open the\npossibility of providing further guidance in the future, in\nresponse to (and grounded on) lower courts\u2019 evolving experience.\nSeeid.,at 534\u2013535;Martinv.Franklin Capital\nCorp., 546 U.\u00a0S. 132 , n. (2005) (noting thatFogertywas not intended to be the end of the matter).The parties here, though sharing some common\nground, now dispute what else we should say to district courts.\nBoth Kirtsaeng and Wiley agree\u2014as they must\u2014that \u00a7505 grants courts\nwide latitude to award attorney\u2019s fees based on the totality of\ncircumstances in a case. See Brief for Petitioner 17; Brief for\nRespondent 35. Yet both reject the position, taken by some Courts\nof Appeals, seesupra,at 3, n.\u00a01, thatFogertyspelled out the only appropriate limits on judicial discretion\u2014in\nother words, that each district court should otherwise proceed as\nit sees fit, assigning whatever weight to whatever factors it\nchooses. Rather, Kirtsaeng and Wiley both call, in almost identical\nlanguage, for \u201c[c]hanneling district court discretion towards the\npurposes of the Copyright Act.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 16; see Brief\nfor Respondent 21 (\u201c[A]n appellate court [should] channel a\ndistrict court\u2019s discretion so that it .\u00a0.\u00a0. further[s]\nthe goals of the Copyright Act\u201d). (And indeed, as discussed later,\nboth describe those purposes identically. Seeinfra,at 6.)\nBut at that point, the two part ways. Wiley argues that giving\nsubstantial weight to the reasonableness of a losing party\u2019s\nposition will best serve the Act\u2019s objectives. See Brief for\nRespondent 24\u201335. By contrast, Kirtsaeng favors giving special\nconsideration to whether a lawsuit resolved an important and close\nlegal issue and thus \u201cmeaningfully clarifie[d]\u201d copyright law.\nBrief for Petitioner 36; seeid.,at 41\u201344.We join both parties in seeing a need for some\nadditional guidance respecting the application of \u00a7505. In\naddressing other open-ended fee-shifting statutes, this Court has\nemphasized that \u201cin a system of laws discretion is rarely without\nlimits.\u201dFlight Attendantsv.Zipes, 491 U.\u00a0S.\n754, 758 (1989) ; seeHalo Electronics, Inc.v.Pulse\nElectronics, Inc.,ante, at 8. Without governing\nstandards or principles, such provisions threaten to condone\njudicial \u201cwhim\u201d or predilection.Martin, 546 U.\u00a0S., at\n139; see alsoibid.(\u201c[A] motion to [a court\u2019s] discretion\nis a motion, not to its inclination, but to its judgment; and its\njudgment is to be guided by sound legal principles\u201d (quotingUnited Statesv.Burr, 25 F. Cas. 30, 35 (No.\n14,692d) (CC Va. 1807) (Marshall, C. J.))). At the least, utterly\nfreewheeling inquiries often deprive litigants of \u201cthe basic\nprinciple of justice that like cases should be decided alike,\u201dMartin, 546 U.\u00a0S., at 139\u2014as when, for example, one\njudge thinks the parties\u2019 \u201cmotivation[s]\u201d determinative and another\nbelieves the need for \u201ccompensation\u201d trumps all else,Fogerty, 510 U.\u00a0S., at 534, n. 19. And so too, such\nunconstrained discretion prevents individuals from predicting how\nfee decisions will turn out, and thus from making properly informed\njudgments about whether to litigate. For those reasons, when\napplying fee-shifting laws with \u201cno explicit limit or condition,\u201dHalo, ante, at 8, we have nonetheless \u201cfound limits\u201d in\nthem\u2014and we have done so, just as both parties urge, by looking to\n\u201cthe large objectives of the relevant Act,\u201dZipes, 491\nU.\u00a0S., at 759 (internal quotation marks omitted); seesupra,at 5.In accord with such precedents, we must consider\nif either Wiley\u2019s or Kirtsaeng\u2019s proposal well advances the\nCopyright Act\u2019s goals. Those objectives are well settled. AsFogertyexplained, \u201ccopyright law ultimately serves the\npurpose of enriching the general public through access to creative\nworks.\u201d 510 U.\u00a0S., at 527; see U.\u00a0S. Const., Art.\u00a0I,\n\u00a78, cl.\u00a08 (\u201cTo promote the Progress of Science and useful\nArts\u201d). The statute achieves that end by striking a balance between\ntwo subsidiary aims: encouraging and rewarding authors\u2019 creations\nwhile also enabling others to build on that work. SeeFogerty, 510 U.\u00a0S., at 526. Accordingly, fee awards\nunder \u00a7505 should encourage the types of lawsuits that promote\nthose purposes. (That is why, for example,Fogertyinsisted\non treating prevailing plaintiffs and prevailing defendants\nalike\u2014because the one could \u201cfurther the policies of the Copyright\nAct every bit as much as\u201d the other. 510 U.\u00a0S., at\n527.) On that much, both parties agree. Brief for Petitioner\n37; Brief for Respondent 29\u201330. The contested issue is whether\ngiving substantial weight to the objective (un)reasonableness of a\nlosing party\u2019s litigating position\u2014or, alternatively, to a\nlawsuit\u2019s role in settling significant and uncertain legal\nissues\u2014will predictably encourage such useful copyright\nlitigation.The objective-reasonableness approach that Wiley\nfavors passes that test because it both encourages parties with\nstrong legal positions to stand on their rights and deters those\nwith weak ones from proceeding with litigation. When a\nlitigant\u2014whether plaintiff or defendant\u2014is clearly correct, the\nlikelihood that he will recover fees from the opposing\n(i.e.,unreasonable) party gives him an incentive to\nlitigate the case all the way to the end. The holder of a copyright\nthat has obviously been infringed has good reason to bring and\nmaintain a suit even if the damages at stake are small; and\nlikewise, a person defending against a patently meritless copyright\nclaim has every incentive to keep fighting, no matter that\nattorney\u2019s fees in a pro-tracted suit might be as or more costly\nthan a settlement. Conversely, when a person (again, whether\nplaintiff or defendant) has an unreasonable litigating position,\nthe likelihood that he will have to pay two sets of fees\ndiscourages legal action. The copyright holder with no reasonable\ninfringement claim has good reason not to bring suit in the first\ninstance (knowing he cannot force a settlement and will have to\nproceed to judgment); and the infringer with no reasonable defense\nhas every reason to give in quickly, before each side\u2019s litigation\ncosts mount. All of those results promote the Copyright Act\u2019s\npurposes, by enhancing the probability that both creators and users\n(i.e.,potential plaintiffs and defendants) will enjoy the\nsubstantive rights the statute provides.By contrast, Kirtsaeng\u2019s proposal would not\nproduce any sure benefits. We accept his premise that litigation of\nclose cases can help ensure that \u201cthe boundaries of copyright law\n[are] demarcated as clearly as possible,\u201d thus advancing the public\ninterest in creative work. Brief for Petitioner 19 (quotingFogerty, 510 U.\u00a0S., at 527). But we cannot agree that\nfee-shifting will necessarily, or even usually, encourage parties\nto litigate those cases to judgment. Fee awards are a double-edged\nsword: They increase the reward for a victory\u2014but also enhance the\npenalty for a defeat. And the hallmark of hard cases is that no\nparty can be confident if he will win or lose. That means\nKirtsaeng\u2019s approach could just as easily discourage as encourage\nparties to pursue the kinds of suits that \u201cmeaningfully clarif[y]\u201d\ncopyright law. Brief for Petitioner 36. It would (by definition)\nraise the stakes of such suits; but whether those higher stakes\nwould provide an incentive\u2014or instead a disincentive\u2014to litigate\nhinges on a party\u2019s attitude toward risk. Is the person\nrisk-preferring or risk-averse\u2014a high-roller or a penny-ante type?\nOnly the former would litigate more in Kirtsaeng\u2019s world. See\nPosner, An Economic Approach to Legal Procedure and Judicial\nAdministration, 2 J. Legal Studies 399, 428 (1973) (fees\n\u201cmake[\u00a0] the expected value of litigation less for risk-averse\nlitigants, which will encourage [them to] settle[\u00a0]\u201d). And\nKirtsaeng offers no reason to think that serious gamblers\npredominate. See,e.g.,Texas Industries, Inc.v.Radcliff Materials, Inc., 451 U.\u00a0S. 630 , n.\u00a08\n(1981) (\u201cEconomists disagree over whether business\ndecisionmakers[\u00a0] are \u2018risk averse\u2019\u00a0\u201d);CIGNA\nCorp.v.Amara, 563 U.\u00a0S. 421, 430 (2011) (\u201c[M]ost\nindividuals are risk averse\u201d). So the value of his standard, unlike\nWiley\u2019s, is entirely speculative.[2]What is more, Wiley\u2019s approach is more\nadministrable than Kirtsaeng\u2019s. A district court that has ruled on\nthe merits of a copyright case can easily assess whether the losing\nparty advanced an unreasonable claim or defense. That is closely\nrelated to what the court has already done: In deciding any case, a\njudge cannot help but consider the strength and weakness of each\nside\u2019s arguments. By contrast, a judge may not know at the\nconclusion of a suit whether a newly decided issue will have, as\nKirtsaeng thinks critical, broad legal significance. The\nprecedent-setting, law-clarifying value of a decision may become\napparent only in retrospect\u2014sometimes, not until many years later.\nAnd so too a decision\u2019s practical impact (to the extent Kirtsaeng\nwould have courts separately consider that factor). District courts\nare not accustomed to evaluating in real time either the\njurisprudential or the on-the-ground import of their rulings.\nExactly how they would do so is uncertain (Kirtsaeng points to no\nother context in which courts undertake such an analysis), but we\nfear that the inquiry would implicate our oft-stated concern that\nan application for attorney\u2019s fees \u201cshould not result in a second\nmajor litigation.\u201dZipes, 491 U.\u00a0S., at 766 (quotingHensleyv.Eckerhart, 461 U.\u00a0S. 424, 437 (1983)\n). And we suspect that even at the end of that post-lawsuit\nlawsuit, the results would typically reflect little more than\nedu-cated guesses.Contrary to Kirtsaeng\u2019s view, placing\nsubstantial weight on objective reasonableness also treats\nplaintiffs and defendants even-handedly, asFogertycommands. No matter which side wins a case, the court must assess\nwhether the other side\u2019s position was (un)reasonable. And of\ncourse, both plaintiffs and defendants can (and sometimes do) make\nunreasonable arguments. Kirtsaeng claims that the reasonableness\ninquiry systematically favors plaintiffs because a losing defendant\n\u201cwill virtuallyalwaysbe found to have done something\nculpable.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 29 (emphasis in original). But that\nconflates two different questions: whether a defendant in fact\ninfringed a copyright and whether he made serious arguments in\ndefense of his conduct. Courts every day see reasonable defenses\nthat ultimately fail (just as they see reasonable claims that come\nto nothing); in this context, as in any other, they are capable of\ndistinguishing between those defenses (or claims) and the\nobjectively unreason-able variety. And if some court confuses the\nissue of liability with that of reasonableness, its fee award\nshould be reversed for abuse of discretion.[3]All of that said, objective reasonableness can\nbe only an important factor in assessing fee applications\u2014not the\ncontrolling one. As we recognized inFogerty, \u00a7505 con-fers\nbroad discretion on district courts and, in deciding whether to\nfee-shift, they must take into account a range of considerations\nbeyond the reasonableness of litigating positions. Seesupra,at 4. That means in any given case a court may award\nfees even though the losing party offered reasonable arguments (or,\nconversely, deny fees even though the losing party made\nunreasonable ones). For example, a court may order fee-shifting\nbecause of a party\u2019s litigation misconduct, whatever the\nreasonableness of his claims or defenses. See,e.g.,Viva\nVideo, Inc.v.Cabrera, 9 Fed. Appx. 77, 80 (CA2 2001).\nOr a court may do so to deter repeated instances of copyright\ninfringement or overaggressive assertions of copyright claims,\nagain even if the losing position was reasonable in a particular\ncase. See,e.g., Bridgeport Music, Inc.v.WB Music\nCorp., 520 F.\u00a03d 588, 593\u2013595 (CA6 2008) (awarding fees\nagainst a copyright holder who filed hundreds of suits on an\noverbroad legal theory, including in a subset of cases in which it\nwas objectively reasonable). Although objective reasonableness\ncarries significant weight, courts must view all the circumstances\nof a case on their own terms, in light of the Copyright Act\u2019s\nessential goals.And on that score, Kirtsaeng has raised serious\nquestions about how fee-shifting actually operates in the Second\nCircuit. To be sure, the Court of Appeals\u2019 framing of the inquiry\nresembles our own: It calls for a district court to give\n\u201csubstantial weight\u201d to the reasonableness of a losing party\u2019s\nlitigating positions while also considering other relevant\ncircumstances. See 605 Fed. Appx., at 49\u201350;Matthew Bender,\n240 F.\u00a03d, at 122. But the Court of Appeals\u2019 language at times\nsuggests that a finding of reasonableness raises a presumption\nagainst granting fees, seeibid.;supra, at 2\u20133\u2014and\nthat goes too far in cabining how a district court must structure\nits analysis and what it may conclude from its review of relevant\nfactors. Still more, district courts in the Second Circuit appear\nto have overly learned the Court of Appeals\u2019 lesson, turning\n\u201csubstantial\u201d into more nearly \u201cdispositive\u201d weight. As Kirtsaeng\nnotes, hardly any decisions in that Circuit have granted fees when\nthe losing party raised a reasonable argument (and none have denied\nfees when the losing party failed to do so). See Reply Brief 15.\nFor these reasons, we vacate the decision below so that the\nDistrict Court can take another look at Kirtsaeng\u2019s fee\napplication. In sending back the case for this purpose, we do not\nat all intimate that the District Court should reach a different\nconclusion. Rather, we merely ensure that the court will evaluate\nthe motion consistent with the analysis we have set out\u2014giving\nsubstantial weight to the reasonableness of Wiley\u2019s litigating\nposition, but also taking into account all other relevant\nfactors.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*The judgment of the Court of Appeals is\nvacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.Notes1Compare,e.g.,Matthew Bender & Co.v.West Publishing Co., 240\nF.\u00a03d 116, 122 (CA2 2001) (giving substantial weight to\nobjective reasonableness), with,e.g.,Bondv.Blum, 317 F. 3d 385, 397\u2013398 (CA4 2003) (endorsing a\ntotality-of-the-circumstances approach, without according special\nsignificance to any factor), and with,e.g.,Hogan\nSystems, Inc.v.Cybersource Int\u2019l, Inc., 158 F. 3d 319,\n325 (CA5 1998) (presuming that a prevailing party receives\nfees).2This case serves as a\ngood illustration. Imagine you are Kirtsaeng at a key moment in his\ncase\u2014say, when deciding whether to petition this Court for\ncertiorari. And suppose (as Kirtsaeng now wishes) that the\nprevailing party in a hard and important case\u2014like this one\u2014will\nprobably get a fee award. Does that make you more likely to file,\nbecause you will recoup your own fees if you win? Or less likely to\nfile, because you will foot Wiley\u2019s bills if you lose? Here are\nsome answers to choose from (recalling that you cannot confidently\npredict which way the Court will rule): (A) Six of one, half a\ndozen of the other. (B) Depends if I\u2019m feeling lucky that day. (C)\nLess likely\u2014this is getting scary; who knows how much money Wiley\nwill spend on Supreme Court lawyers? (D) More likely\u2014the higher the\nstakes, the greater the rush. Only if lots of people answer (D)\nwill Kirtsaeng\u2019s standard work in the way advertised. Maybe. But\nthen again, maybe not.3Kirtsaeng also offers\nstatistics meant to show that in practice, even if not in theory,\nthe objective reasonableness inquiry unduly favors plaintiffs; but\nthe Solicitor General asamicus curiaehas cast significant\ndoubt on that claim. According to Kirtsaeng, 86% of winning\ncopyright holders, but only 45% of prevailing defendants, have\nreceived fee awards over the last 15 years in the Second Circuit\n(which, recall, gives substantial weight to objective\nreasonableness). See Reply Brief 17\u201318;supra, at 2\u20133. But\nfirst, the Solicitor General represents that the overall numbers\nare actually 77% and 53%, respectively. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 41.\nAnd second, the Solicitor General points out that all these\npercentages include default judgments, which almost invariably give\nrise to fee awards\u2014but usually of a very small amount\u2014because the\ndefendant has not shown up to oppose either the suit or the fee\napplication. When those cases are taken out, the statistics look\nfairly similar: 60% for plaintiffs versus 53% for defendants. Seeid.,at 42. And of course, there may be good reasons why\ncopyright plaintiffs and defendants do not make reasonable\narguments in perfectly equal proportion.",
