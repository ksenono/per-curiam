FLORENCE, PETITIONERv.BOARD\nOF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF THE COUNTY OF BURLINGTON et\u00a0al.on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the third circuit[April 2, 2012]Chief Justice Roberts, concurring.I join the opinion of the Court. As with Justice\nAlito, however, it is important for me that the Court does not\nforeclose the possibility of an exception to the rule it announces.\nJustice Kennedy explains that the circumstances before it do not\nafford an opportunity to consider that possibility.Ante,at\n18\u201319. Those circumstances include the facts that Florence was\ndetained not for a minor traffic offense but instead pursuant to a\nwarrant for his arrest, and that there was apparently no\nalternative, if Florence were to be detained, to holding him in the\ngeneral jail population.Factual nuances have not played a significant\nrole as this case has been presented to the Court. Both courts\nbelow regarded acknowledged factual disputes as \u201cimmaterial\u201d to\ntheir conflicting dispositions, 621 F.3d 296, 300 (CA3 2010), and\nbefore this Court Florence challenged suspicionless strip searches\n\u201cno matter what the circumstances.\u201d Pet. for Cert. i.The Court makes a persuasive case for the\ngeneral applicability of the rule it announces. The Court is\nnonetheless wise to leave open the possibility of exceptions, to\nensure that we \u201cnot embarrass the future.\u201dNorthwest Airlines,\nInc.v.Minnesota,322 U.S.\n292, 300 (1944) (Frankfurter, J.).",
