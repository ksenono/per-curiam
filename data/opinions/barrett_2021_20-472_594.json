Congress then vested the\nEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA) with authority to grant\n\u201cextension[s] of the exemption\u201d in certain instances. The question\nin this case is straightforward: Does this provision limit EPA to\nprolonging exemptions currently in place, or does it enable EPA to\nprovide exemptions to refineries that lack them? The statute\u2019s text\nand structure direct a clear answer: EPA cannot \u201cextend\u201d an\nexemption that a refinery no longer has. Because the Court\u2019s\ncontrary conclusion caters to an outlier meaning of \u201cextend\u201d and\nclashes with statutory structure, I respectfully dissent.IRefineries regulated by the RFP come in all\nshapes and sizes\u2014ranging from those run by Fortune-500 companies\nlike HollyFrontier to local outfits with less fuel-blending\ncapacity and access to capital. So, as the Court notes, Congress\nmade certain accommodations for small refineries that might\notherwise struggle to satisfy their RFP obligations.To start, Congress in subparagraph (A)(i) gave\nall small refineries\u2014including petitioners (HollyFrontier)\u2014a\n\u201c[t]emporary exemption\u201d from the program\u2019s renewable-fuel\nrequirements; the exemption ran from the RFP\u2019s passage in 2005\nuntil 2011. 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a77545(o)(9)(A)(i). Then,\nin subparagraph (A)(ii), Congress directed the Department of Energy\nto conduct a study\u2014to be completed no later than the end of 2008\u2014to\ndetermine whether compliance with the RFP \u201cwould impose a\ndisproportionate economic hardship on small refineries.\u201d\n\u00a77545(o)(9)(A)(ii)(I). If so, the statute provides, EPA\n\u201cshall extend the exemption\u201d initially enjoyed by all small\nrefineries \u201cfor a period of not less than 2 additional years.\u201d\n\u00a77545(o)(9)(A)(ii)(II).Congress also provided small refineries an\navenue to petition for an \u201cextension\u201d of these initial exemptions.\nThis is the provision at the heart of this case:\u201cA small refinery may at any time petition\n[EPA] for an extension of the exemption under subparagraph (A) for\nthe reason of disproportionate economic hardship.\u201d\n\u00a77545(o)(9)(B)(i).Deciding that this subparagraph uses \u201cextension\u201d\nto mean \u201ccontinuation\u201d should be an easy call. Following\nHolly-Frontier\u2019s lead, however, the Court forgoes the obvious\nanswer.AHollyFrontier lays its cards on the table. It\ndoes not dispute that when used to refer to \u201can increase in the\nlength of time,\u201d the word \u201cextension\u201d can\u2014and commonly does\u2014refer\nto something that is prolonged without interruption. Brief for\nPetitioners 29. Yet, HollyFrontier insists, the term \u201cextension\u201d is\nnotalwaysused that way. Instead, it mightsometimesrefer to a \u201cnon-continuous extension\u201d\u2014in other words, an extension\nof something that used to exist but no longer does.Ibid.Because there is \u201cnothing unnatural\u201d about reading the term this\nway, HollyFrontier urges us to embrace this interpretation.Id., at 31.One might think that this argument is an uphill\nclimb\u2014after all, we do not usually pin an interpretation to \u201cthe\nouter limits of a word\u2019s definitional possibilities\u201d at the expense\nof its ordinary or common meaning.[1]FCCv.AT&T Inc.,562 U.S.\n397, 407 (2011) (alterations omitted). But the Court takes\nHollyFrontier\u2019s framing and runs with it. The Court points out that\nthe word \u201cextension\u201d \u201ccan\u201d or \u201cmay\u201d be used to refer to post-lapse\nrenewals.Ante, at 6. And because the statute thus\n\u201ccommands\u201d no \u201ccontinuity requirement,\u201dante, at 16, the\nCourt concludes that Holly-Frontier\u2019s reading must be right\u2014which\nmeans that EPA can provide an \u201cextension\u201d of an exemption that is\nno longer in effect.Boiled down, the Court\u2019s position is that\nHollyFrontier wins because its reading ispossible. But I\nwould ask, as we typically do, how the term \u201cextension\u201d \u201cismost\nnaturallyread.\u201dFlorida Dept. of Revenuev.Piccadilly Cafeterias,Inc.,554 U.S.\n33, 39 (2008) (emphasis added); see alsoRomag\nFasteners,Inc.v.Fossil Group,Inc., 590\nU.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2020) (slip op., at 4). The Tenth Circuit\u2019s\nanswer to that question is spot on: The \u201cordinary definitions of\n\u2018extension,\u2019 along with common sense, dictate that the subject of\nan extension must be in existence before it can be extended.\u201dRenewable Fuels Assn.v.EPA, 948 F.3d 1206, 1245\n(2020).1In assessing the best reading of the phrase\n\u201cextension of the exemption,\u201d the Court is of course correct that\ncontext matters. Here, though, context cuts respondents\u2019 way.\nSubparagraph (B)(i) does not use \u201cextension\u201d in a vacuum; rather,\nit permits EPA to grant an \u201cextensionof the exemptionunder subparagraph (A).\u201d \u00a77545(o)(9)(B)(i) (emphasis\nadded). What is being \u201cextended,\u201d then, is \u201cthe exemption under\nsubparagraph (A)\u201d\u2014a discrete, time-limited period of permissible\nnoncompliance with the RFP. And when used in this context, the noun\n\u201cextension\u201d means an \u201caddition that increases the .\u00a0.\u00a0.\noperation .\u00a0.\u00a0. of something,\u201d \u201ca stretching out or\nstretching forth: a carrying forward,\u201d or \u201ca part that is added to\nsomething to enlarge or prolong it; a continuation.\u201d[2] The verb \u201cextend\u201d is similarly defined: It\nmeans \u201c[t]o cause (something) to be or last longer,\u201d to \u201clengthen,\nelongate, prolong, protract,\u201d or \u201c[t]o prolong in\nduration.\u201d[3]The Court acknowledges these definitions, yet\nstill parrots HollyFrontier\u2019s point that no definition of \u201cextend\u201drequires\u201cunbroken continuity.\u201dAnte, at 6. But\nwithout something that presently exists, there is nothing to\n\u201ccarr[y] forward\u201d or \u201cprolong.\u201d The word \u201cextension,\u201d then, plainly\ncontemplates a \u201ccontinuation of the same\u201d thing as currently\nexists\u2014in contrast to the term \u201crenewal,\u201d for example, which refers\nto a \u201crestoring\u201d or \u201creestablishing\u201d of something that used to\nexist. Compare Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 622 (8th ed. 2004), withid., at 1322. Or, to put it slightly differently, the word\n\u201cextension\u201d \u201c\u00a0\u2018[i]mports the continuance of an existing\nthing.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Brief for Federal Respondent 21 (quoting W.\nAnderson, A Dictionary of Law 437 (1996)).Common usage confirms as much. Consider a hotel\nguest who decides to spend a few more days on vacation. That guest\nlikely would ask to \u201cextend [her] visit.\u201d Random House Webster\u2019s\nUnabridged Dictionary 684 (2d ed. 2001) (emphasis deleted). Now\nsuppose the same guest returns to the same hotel three years later\nand, upon arrival, requests to \u201cextend\u201d her prior stay. The hotel\nemployee would no doubt \u201cscratch her head.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 26.\nWhy? Because it is highly unnatural to speak of \u201cextending\u201d a stay\nthat ended years before.Similar examples spring readily to mind. One\nwould not normally ask to \u201cextend\u201d a newspaper subscription long\nafter it expired. Or request, after child number two, to \u201cextend\u201d\nthe parental-leave period completed after child number one. Or\nreport that an athlete signed a contract \u201cextension\u201d with her first\nteam after spending several seasons with a rival squad. These\nexamples do not derive their force by superimposing a \u201ccontinuity\nrequirement\u201d on the word \u201cextend.\u201d Cf.ante, at 6, 8, 9, 10,\n12, 13, 16. Instead, continuity is inherent in the way that people\nusually use the word \u201cextension\u201d\u2014namely, to reference something\ncurrently \u201cin existence\u201d such that there is a \u201ccontinuing\nconnection with the thing to be extended.\u201d Brief for Federal\nRespondent 21. That is so, moreover, absent any additional\n\u201cmodifying language\u201d requiring the \u201cextension\u201d to be\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018consecutive\u2019\u00a0\u201d or \u201c\u00a0\u2018successive.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAnte, at 8.By dismissing the need for a continuing\nconnection between the first period and the second, the Court\nforgoes the \u201cfar more natural\u201d reading of extend.Taniguchiv.Kan Pacific Saipan,Ltd.,566\nU.S. 560, 569 (2012). The upshot? A refinery could ask to\n\u201cextend\u201d an exemption it had in 2010 in the year 2040, with no need\nto connect the two periods. It defies ordinary usage to deem the\nsecond exemption \u201can extension\u201d of the first, as opposed to a new,\nstandalone exemption. HollyFrontier recognizes as much, seeking to\ndeflect this example as \u201cextreme\u201d and \u201chighly unlikely.\u201d Tr. of\nOral Arg. 28. Unlikely or not, it follows logically from\nHollyFrontier\u2019s reading of \u201cextension\u201d\u2014which shows just how far\nthis interpretation strays from the term\u2019s ordinary meaning.2The Court\u2019s counterexamples do not help its\ncase. Take its discussion of deadline \u201cextensions\u201d\u2014as given, say,\nto a student who seeks more time to complete a paper even after the\ndue date has passed or to a party who requests leave to file a\ndocument after the court\u2019s original deadline. Seeante, at\n6\u20138. In this context, \u201cextension\u201d refers to \u201can additional period\nof time given one to meet an obligation.\u201d Random House Webster\u2019s\nUnabridged Dictionary, at 684; see also American Heritage\nDictionary, at 628 (\u201c[a]n allowance of extra time, as for the\nrepayment of a debt\u201d); Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, at 622 (\u201c[a] period\nof additional time to take an action, make a decision, accept an\noffer, or complete a task\u201d). Because there is nothing odd about\ngranting an extension even after the deadline has lapsed, the Court\ninsists that there is nothing odd about granting HollyFrontier an\nexemption \u201cextension\u201d even after its initial exemption period has\nexpired.Put aside for the moment that this case does not\ninvolve the extension of a deadline. The Court\u2019s reasoning still\nbreaks down because when a deadline \u201cextension\u201d is granted, there\nis no \u201clapse\u201d: The new deadline runs back to the old. In other\nwords, a post-due-date extension does not start anewperiod\nfor timely action. It forgives the missed deadline by retroactively\nprolonging the pre-existing period. Even in the Court\u2019s\ndeadline-extension examples, then, there is continuity.[4]Problems likewise plague the Court\u2019s other\nhypotheticals involving delay in \u201cseek[ing] an \u2018extension,\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nsuch as the tenant who asks to \u201cextend\u201d her lease after overstaying\nit or parties who negotiate to \u201cextend\u201d a contract after it\nexpires.Ante, at 6. These examples confuse the time at\nwhich one may permissiblyrequestan extension withwhatis being extended. It may be that the tenant could\nrequest an \u201cextension\u201d of the year-one lease at some point after\nthe start of year two. But, if approved, the tenant\u2019s lease would\nstill be continuous\u2014running from year one to year two\u2014and the\ntenant would no doubt owe rent for the intervening period. By\ncontrast, the Court\u2019s reading of \u201cextend\u201d would capture a tenant\nwho moves out in year one and returns in year five. In that\nscenario, no one would say that the tenant sought an \u201cextension\u201d of\nher lease\u2014nor would anyone expect the tenant to pay back-rent for\nthe intervening years.The Court next reaches for recent congressional\nenactments\u2014or more specifically, for their captions. The title of\ntwo COVID\u201319 relief provisions, the Court notes, purported to\nprovide an \u201cextension\u201d of certain unemployment benefits that had\npreviously lapsed. Seeante, at 7 (quoting Pub. L. 116\u2013260,\n\u00a7203, 134Stat. 1182; Pub. L. 116\u2013136, \u00a72114, 134Stat. 281). I will\nstart with the obvious: Invoking captions from \u201cdifferent\nstatute[s] altogether,\u201d passed in an emergency context over a\ndecade after the RFP, \u201cdoes not have much force.\u201d A. Scalia &\nB. Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 172\n(2012). The argument is made weaker still by the fact that Congress\nused \u201cextension\u201d the other way in the RFP statute itself. Seeinfra, at 8. And it is telling that apart from the COVID\u201319\nrelief provisions, HollyFrontier could identify no other instance\nin which Congress used \u201cextension\u201d in the way that Holly-Frontier\nproposes.At the very most, the Court\u2019s COVID\u201319 examples\nshow that \u201cextend\u201d does not \u201calwaysinclud[e] a strict\ncontinuity requirement.\u201dAnte, at 8 (emphasis added). But\n\u201c[t]hat a definition is broad enough to encompass one sense of a\nword does not establish that the word isordinarilyunderstood in that sense.\u201dTaniguchi, 566 U.\u00a0S., at\n568. Because respondents\u2019 interpretation of \u201cextension\u201d is \u201cfar\nmore natural,\u201did., at 569, it is the presumptive\nfavorite\u2014barring compelling evidence to the contrary in the\nstatute\u2019s structure. As it turns out, statutory structure favors\nrespondents\u2019 reading too.B1Four structural features of the RFP, in\nparticular, cut for respondents\u2019 interpretation and against the\nCourt\u2019s.First, respondents\u2019 reading of\n\u201cextension\u201d tracks the only other use of the term in the RFP. A\nnearby \u201c[w]aiver\u201d provision allows EPA to issue an \u201corder to\nreduce, for up to a 60-day period,\u201d the biomass-based diesel fuel\nrequirements under certain conditions. \u00a77545(o)(7)(E)(ii).\nIn a related provision entitled \u201c[e]xtensions,\u201d Congress authorized\nEPA to reduce those requirements \u201cfor up to an additional 60-day\nperiod\u201d based on an assessment that the conditions are \u201ccontinuing\nbeyond\u201d the original \u201c60-day period.\u201d \u00a77545(o)(7)(E)(iii).\nThis provision, like respondents\u2019 interpretation, uses \u201cextension\u201d\nto reference a continuation of something that presently exists. Cf.ante, at 5 (noting that \u201cabsent contrary evidence, this\nCourt normally presumes consistent usage\u201d).Second, the RFP is replete with express\ngrants of waiver authority of the type the Court reads into\nsubparagraph (B)(i)\u2019s reference to \u201cextension[s].\u201d The statute\u2019s\n\u201cgeneral\u201d waiver provision specifies that EPA, under certain\neconomic or fuel-market conditions, \u201cmay waive the requirements\u201d of\nthe RFP \u201cin whole or in part on petition by\u201d refineries, among\nother entities. \u00a77545(o)(7)(A). As discussed, EPA also has\nexpress standalone waiver authority with respect to biomass-based\ndiesel levels. See \u00a77545(o)(7)(E)(ii) (EPA can \u201cissue an\norder to reduce, for up to a 60-day period, the quantity of\nbiomass-based diesel required\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. \u201d). Elsewhere,\nthe statute authorizes EPA to \u201cwaive, in whole or in part, the\nrenewable fuel requirement[s]\u201d following a finding that compliance\nwould have a significant adverse impact on consumers at the outset\nof the program. \u00a77545(o)(8)(D)(i).Together, these nearby RFP provisions show that\nCongress had an \u201ceasy way\u201d to delegate standalone waiver authority\nwhen it wished.Advocate Health Care Networkv.Stapleton, 581 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 8).\nYet Congress \u201cdid not adopt that ready alternative\u201d in subparagraph\n(B)(i)\u2014it instead used \u201clanguage whose most natural reading\u201d doesnotcontemplate freestanding waiver authority.Ibid.See alsoante, at 8 (looking to \u201cthe absence of any parallel\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. language\u201d as an interpretive \u201cclue\u201d).Third, note that when assessing petitions\nfor an \u201cextension of the exemption,\u201d EPA must consider \u201cthe\nfindings of the study under subparagraph (A)(ii)\u201d\u2014i.e., the\nDepartment of Energy study to be completed by 2008. See\n\u00a7\u00a77545(o)(9)(B)(i)\u2013(ii). The Court\u2019s reading will require\nEPA to examine the 2008 study when evaluating \u201cextension\u201d petitions\nfiled decades from now\u2014say, in 2050\u2014even though the refinery may\nhave had long stretches of compliance in the interim. If Congress\nintended exemption \u201cextension[s]\u201d\u2014or waivers, as the Court treats\nthem\u2014to remain available for decades, why would it instruct EPA to\nkeep evaluating them in light of a 2008 study? Respondents\u2019 reading\nmakes more sense of this instruction because it embraces the\npossibility, even the likelihood, that exemptions would not be\navailable forever. Funneling refineries toward compliance means\nthat it would be surprising rather than expected for EPA to be\nconsidering a 2008 study in 2050.Fourth, other provisions help ease the\nburden on small refineries in times of economic hardship. To ensure\nthat EPA can appropriately adjust the RFP requirements it sets, the\nstatute requires EPA to review \u201cthe feasibility of achieving\ncompliance\u201d and \u201cimpacts of\u00a0\u201d the RFP on regulated refineries.\n\u00a7\u00a77545(o)(11)(B)\u2013(C). And if compliance is not feasible in a\ngiven year, the RFP allows individual refineries to carry a\ncompliance deficit into the next year. Seeante, at 2\n(discussing \u00a77545(o)(5)(D)). Recall too that in cases where\ncompliance would work severe economic harm on a State or a region,\nthe general-waiver provision allows EPA to waive the requirements\nin whole or in part. \u00a77545(o)(7)(A)(i). Economic concerns\nare at the center of other RFP waiver provisions as well. See\n\u00a77545(o)(7)(E)(ii) (waiver based on price of biomass-based\ndiesel fuel); \u00a7\u00a77545(o)(8)(A)\u2013(D) (waiver based on\n\u201csignificant adverse impacts on consumers,\u201d including impacts on\n\u201csupplies and prices\u201d). Congress\u2019 direct concern with economic\ndifficulties in separate provisions further undermines\nHollyFrontier\u2019s argument that Congress must have meant to vindicate\nsuch concerns by granting EPA broad waiver power in subparagraph\n(B)(i).2The Court\u2019s structural counters are not\npersuasive.First, the Court cites the statute\u2019s\ninstruction that a small refinery can file a subparagraph (B)(i)\npetition \u201c\u00a0\u2018at any time.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Seeante,at 9\n(quoting \u00a77545(o)(9)(B)(i)). This argument falls apart on\nclose inspection. \u201c[A]t any time\u201d informswhena refinery\nmay file an \u201cextension\u201d request; it cannot change the type of\nrequest that EPA can grant. By using the phrase \u201cat any time,\u201d the\nstatute gives a small refinery with an exemption flexibility about\nwhen to file a request to extend that exemption for the following\nyear.This reading does not leave \u201cat any time\u201d\nwithout important work to do. For one, the phrase means that\nrefineries need not seek exemptions before EPA\u2019s fuel standards are\ndue\u2014which is November 30 in the calendar year before the refinery\nmust apply. \u00a77545(o)(3)(B). This is a \u201csignificant statutory\nconcession.\u201d 948 F.\u00a03d, at 1248. It allows (but does not\nrequire) regulated refineries to see what their obligations will be\nbefore deciding whether to seek an exemption; it also means that\nEPA may not always be able to \u201c\u00a0\u2018compensate for the\nrenewable-fuel shortfall created by belated exemptions.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIbid.(quotingAmerican Fuel & Petrochemical\nMfrs.v.EPA, 937 F.3d 559, 571 (CADC 2019)).In addition, the phrase helps account for the\ndelayed-request scenarios the Court posits. Seeante, at 7.\nTo see why, suppose that a refinery with an exemption in 2014\nplanned to ramp up its operations in 2015 and anticipated that it\nwould no longer need or qualify for exempt status. Then imagine\nthat, halfway through 2015, the refinery concluded that it would in\nfact need an exemption for that year. The \u201cat any time\u201d provision\nallows it to file for one, thereby giving refineries the ability to\nadjust in the face of \u201cmarket fluctuations and changing hardship\nconditions.\u201dAnte, at 9. Unlike the Court\u2019s interpretation,\nthis account of \u201cat any time\u201d respects the ordinary meaning of\n\u201cextension\u201d by requiring the \u201cexemptions\u201d themselves to run\ncontinuously\u2014in the above example, from 2014 to 2015.Second, the Court leans on the fact that\n\u201csubparagraph (A) uses the term \u2018extension\u2019withouta\ncontinuity requirement.\u201dIbid.That must be so, according to\nthe Court, because a refinery could fall out of small-refinery\nstatus, say, in 2010, yet still receive an \u201cextension of the\nexemption\u201d for 2011 under subparagraph (A)(ii).It is hard to know quite what to make of the\nCourt\u2019s theory. It never played out in practice, as EPA regulations\nmeant that no small refinery lost exempt status during the years in\nquestion. See 72 Fed. Reg. 23925 (2007); 75 Fed. Reg. 14866 (2010);\nsee also Tr. of Oral Arg. 66\u201367. And the theory was neither passed\non by the court below nor discussed by respondents here, as it\nappeared for the first time in a footnote of HollyFrontier\u2019s reply\nbrief. Reply Brief 10, n.\u00a06. But in any event, the Court\u2019s\naccount does not seem to prove that subparagraph (A) permits a\n\u201claps[e].\u201dAnte, at 10. What EPA may \u201cextend\u201d via\nsubparagraph (A)(ii) is \u201cthe exemption under clause (i)\u201d\u2014that is,\nthe initial, automatic exemption that excused all small refineries\nfrom compliance through 2010. The \u201cexemption under clause (i)\u201d thus\nexisted in the year 2010 by virtue of statute, even if a particular\nrefinery was not in a position to take advantage of it. \u201cExtending\u201d\nthat exemption into 2011\u2014should the refinery once again qualify for\nsmall-refinery status\u2014would thus appear to be consistent with\nrespondents\u2019 reading of the term. Regardless, any ambiguity about\nthe functioning of subparagraph (A) cannot save an argument that is\notherwise overwhelmed by the term\u2019s ordinary meaning and other\naspects of the RFP\u2019s structure.IIThe Court declines to \u201cpick sides\u201d in the\nparties\u2019 dispute over which reading of subparagraph (B)(i) best\nfulfills congressional purpose.Ante, at 15. At the same\ntime, the Court criticizes respondents\u2019 reading for causing the\n\u201cstrange effect\u201d of treating the least compliant refineries most\nfavorably.Ibid.In the Court\u2019s telling, extensions that\nfunction as waivers (its view) give refineries that comply in some\nyears a boost when they need help. Extensions that prolong a grace\nperiod (respondents\u2019 view) reward refineries that never manage to\ncomply.But respondents\u2019 argument that subparagraph\n(B)(i) extensions give small refineries an initial runway\u2014rather\nthan a down-the-road safety valve\u2014is not at all odd if, as\nrespondents assert, Congress intended the RFP to funnel all\nrefineries into eventual compliance.[5] Maybe respondents\u2019 story about the statute\u2019s purpose is\nright; maybe it is wrong. In all events, though, it is not\n\u201cstrange\u201d\u2014in fact, the Court deems this account just as \u201cplausible\u201d\nas any.Ante, at 15.Plus, the Court\u2019s reading of subparagraph (B)(i)\nyields its own odd results: It means that EPA\u2019s exemption power\ncovers only those refineries in existence at the RFP\u2019s outset. This\nmakes little sense if one accepts HollyFrontier\u2019s account of the\nprovision\u2019s \u201csafety valve\u201d purpose.Ibid.(internal\nquotation marks omitted). If Congress\u2019 point was to give leeway to\nrefineries subject to unpredictable market fluctuations and\never-increasing compliance burdens, then it is hard to see why the\nprovision would distinguish between old and new refineries facing\n\u201cthe same current economic outlook\u201d in a given year. Brief for\nFederal Respondent 43, n.\u00a07.In the end, the parties\u2019 dueling accounts of\npurpose underscore the wisdom of sticking to the statutory text and\nstructure. Because, in my view, both clearly favor respondents\u2019\nreading, I respectfully dissent.Notes1To be sure, in some\ncontexts we have asked whether a term can \u201cpermissib[ly]\u201d bear an\nasserted meaning.E.g.,Chevron U.\u00a0S.\u00a0A.\nInc.v.Natural Resources Defense Council,Inc.,467 U.S.\n837, 843 (1984). The Court avoids express reliance on that\nargument here.2American Heritage\nDictionary 628 (4th ed. 2000); Webster\u2019s Third New International\nDictionary 804 (2002); New Oxford American Dictionary 596 (2d ed.\n2005).3American Heritage\nDictionary, at 628; Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary,\nat 804 (capitalization deleted); 5 Oxford English Dictionary 594\n(2d ed. 1989).4The hypothetical that the\nCourt offers to refute this critique\u2014a teacher authorizing a\nstudent who missed a Friday deadline to turn in a paper between 8\na.m. and 9 a.m. on Monday\u2014gets it nowhere. It is either an\nextension of the deadline to 9 a.m. on Monday, in which case it\noperates like the other deadline extensions I have described, with\nthe teacher simply specifying when she will be present to receive\nthe paper. Or it is an example of something other than a deadline\nextension\u2014like the start of an entirely new window for timely\nconduct\u2014in which case it is inapposite.5This funneling effect\nstarted to play out. Although about half of all small refineries\ninitially received study- or petition-based extensions, fewer\nrefineries sought and received such extensions as time went on. By\n2014, most small refineries, including petitioners, were meeting\ntheir renewable-fuel obligations. The number of exempt refineries\nlater spiked\u2014with EPA granting 35 petitions for compliance year\n2017, and 31 for 2018\u2014when EPA came to a new view of how to\nadminister subparagraph (B)(i).",
