BARR, ATTORNEY GENERAL;\nandRUBEN OVALLES, PETITIONER18\u20131015v.WILLIAM P. BARR, ATTORNEY GENERALon writs of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the fifth circuit[March 23, 2020]Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Alito joins\nas to all but Part II\u2013A\u20131, dissenting.We granted certiorari to decide whether a denial\nof equitable tolling for lack of due diligence is reviewable as a\n\u201cquestion of law\u201d under 8\u00a0U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71252(a)(2)(D).\nNot content with resolving that narrow question, the Court\ncategorically proclaims that federal courts may review immigration\njudges\u2019 applications ofanylegal standard to established\nfacts in criminal aliens\u2019 removal proceedings.Ante, at 1\u20132.\nIn doing so, the majority effectively nullifies a\njurisdiction-stripping statute, expanding the scope of judicial\nreview well past the boundaries set by Congress. Because this\narrogation of authority flouts both the text and structure of the\nstatute, I respectfully dissent.IUnder \u00a71252(a)(2)(C), \u201c[n]otwithstanding any\nother provision of law (statutory or\nnonstatutory),\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. no court shall have\njurisdiction to review any final order of removal against an alien\nwho is removable by reason of having committed [certain] criminal\noffense[s].\u201d This broad jurisdiction-stripping provision is known\nas the \u201ccriminal-alien bar.\u201d The only exceptions to the provision\u2019s\notherwise all-encompassing language are found in \u00a71252(a)(2)(D),\nwhich states that \u201c[n]othing in subparagraph .\u00a0.\u00a0. (C)\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. shall be construed as precluding review of\nconstitutional claims or questions of law.\u201d Thus, under the\ncriminal-alien bar, any claim that neither is constitutional nor\nraises a question of law is unreviewable. Because petitioners raise\nno con- stitutional claim and due diligence in the\nequitable-tolling context is not a \u201cquestion of law,\u201d their claims\nare unreviewable.AEquitable tolling\u2019s due-diligence requirement\npresents a mixed question of law and fact. A litigant will qualify\nfor equitable tolling only if he \u201chas pursued his rights diligently\nbut some extraordinary circumstance prevents him from bringing a\ntimely action.\u201dLozanov.Montoya Alvarez,572 U.S.\n1, 10 (2014). To determine whether a litigant has exercised due\ndiligence, judges must conduct what this Court has characterized as\nan \u201c\u00a0\u2018equitable, often fact-intensive\u2019\u00a0\u201d inquiry,\nconsidering \u201cin detail\u201d the unique facts of each case to decide\nwhether a litigant\u2019s efforts were reasonable in light of his\ncircumstances.Hollandv.Florida,560 U.S.\n631, 653\u2013654 (2010) (Breyer, J., for the Court). In other\nwords, courts ask \u201cwhether the historical facts found satisfy the\nlegal test,\u201d which, as this Court recently (and unanimously)\nrecognized, is a quintessential \u201c\u00a0\u2018mixed question\u2019 of law and\nfact.\u201dU.\u00a0S. Bank N.\u00a0A.v.Village at Lake-\nridge, LLC, 583 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2018) (slip op., at 7)\n(quotingPullman-Standardv.Swint,456 U.S.\n273, 289, n.\u00a019 (1982)); but seeante, at 4\u20135.BThe text of \u00a71252(a)(2)(D) authorizes courts\nto review only \u201cconstitutional claims or questions of law.\u201d It does\nnot refer to mixed questions of law and fact, and cannot be divined\nto do so. As the statute\u2019s plain language and structure\ndemonstrate, \u201cquestions of law\u201d cannot reasonably be read to\ninclude mixed questions.Although the statute does not define \u201cquestions\nof law,\u201d longstanding historical practice indicates that the phrase\ndoes not encompass mixed questions of law and fact. For well over a\ncentury, this Court has recognized questions of law, questions of\nfact, and mixed questions of law and fact as three discrete\ncategories. See,e.g., Pullman-Standard,supra, at\n288 (distinguishing between a \u201cquestion of law,\u201d a \u201cmixed question\nof law and fact,\u201d and a \u201cpure question of fact\u201d);Rossv.Day,232 U.S.\n110, 116 (1914) (distinguishing between \u201ca mere question of\nlaw\u201d and \u201ca mixed question of law and fact\u201d);Bates & Guild\nCo.v.Payne,194 U.S.\n106, 109 (1904) (distinguishing between \u201cmixed questions of law\nand fact\u201d and questions \u201cof law alone\u201d);Jewellv.Knight,123 U.S.\n426, 432 (1887) (distinguishing between \u201cquestions of law\nonly,\u201d \u201cquestions of fact,\u201d and questions \u201cof mixed law and fact\u201d);Republican River Bridge Co.v.Kansas Pacific\nR.\u00a0Co.,92 U.S.\n315, 318\u2013319 (1876) (distinguishing between a \u201cmixed question\nof law and fact,\u201d a \u201claw question,\u201d and a \u201cfact [question]\u201d). A\nleading civil procedure treatise at the time of \u00a71252(a)(2)(D)\u2019s\nenactment confirms this understanding. See 9A C. Wright & A.\nMiller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7\u00a72588\u20132589 (2d ed. 1995)\n(distinguishing between conclusions and questions of law, and\n\u201cmixed questions of law and fact\u201d).The majority resists this conclusion by pointing\nto cases in which the Court has characterized mixed questions as\neither legal or factual. But this occasional emphasis on either law\nor fact does not change the reality that many questions include\nboth. This Court sometimes uses these two categories because\n\u201c[m]ixed questions are not all alike\u201d and, in certain contexts,\nthis Court must distinguish between them by determining whether\nthey present primarily legal or primarily factual inquiries.Village at Lakeridge,supra, at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at\n8\u20139) (whether a creditor is a nonstatutory insider presents a\nfactual inquiry); see alsoNeitzkev.Williams,490 U.S.\n319, 326 (1989) (whether a complaint fails to state a claim\npresents a legal inquiry).[1]The Court often uses these labels in contexts\nthat lend themselves to a fact/law dichotomy. For example, it asks\nwhether a question is primarily legal or primarily factual when it\nneeds to determine the appropriate standard of appellate review.\nSee,e.g.,Village atLakeridge,supra,\nat ___ (slip op., at 9). A similar dichotomy arises when the Court\nconsiders whether an issue is one for the judge or jury. See,e.g., United Statesv.Gaudin,515 U.S.\n506, 512 (1995) (\u201cthe application-of-legal-standard-to-fact\nsort of question .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0, commonly called a \u2018mixed\nquestion of law and fact,\u2019 has typically been resolved by juries\u201d\nas a fact issue).But these considerations are irrelevant in the\ncontext of a statutory judicial-review provision such as\n\u00a71252(a)(2), which contains text that refers only to \u201cquestions of\nlaw.\u201d The federal appellate judges who review claims under this\nprovision are competent to review legal, factual, and mixed\nquestions alike; their authority is constrained only by the\nstatutory text. Our task, therefore, is simply to interpret the\nwords of the statute, which invoke no forced dichotomy because\nCongress could have easily included mixed questions in the text if\nit wanted to do so. See,e.g., 38 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a77292(d) (referring to a \u201cchallenge to a law .\u00a0.\u00a0. as\napplied to the facts of a particular case\u201d as distinct from\n\u201cquestions of law\u201d). Accordingly, there is no need to place the\ndue- diligence inquiry into either category here.[2]Moreover, conflating \u201cquestions of law\u201d with\nmixed questions would lead to absurd results in light of the\nstatute\u2019s structure. The criminal-alien bar, which directly\nprecedes 8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71252(a)(2)(D), is an unequivocally\nbroad jurisdiction-stripping provision, barring review\n\u201c[n]otwithstanding any other provision of law (statutory or\nnonstatutory).\u201d \u00a71252(a)(2)(C). That is the default rule. Section\n1252(a)(2)(D) merely delineates two narrow exceptions to this\ncriminal-alien bar\u2014\u201cconstitutional claims\u201d and \u201cquestions of\nlaw.\u201dReading \u201cquestions of law\u201d to includeallmixed questions would turn \u00a71252(a)(2)\u2019s structure on its head. It\nwould transform \u00a71252(a)(2)(D)\u2019s narrow exception into a broad\nprovision permitting judicial review of all criminal aliens\u2019\nchallenges to their removal proceedings except the precious few\nthat raise only pure questions of fact. Because those questions are\nalready effectively unreviewable under the Immigration and\nNationality Act\u2019s (INA\u2019s) extremely deferential standard,\n\u00a71252(b)(4)(B) (Board\u2019s \u201cfindings of fact are conclusive unless any\nreasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the\ncontrary\u201d), this interpretation would reduce the\njurisdiction-stripping provision to a near nullity. Put another\nway, the exception would all but swallow the rule.[3] The logical reading of \u00a71252(a)(2) is that\nthe exception is narrower than the rule and covers only what is\nstated in the text: constitutional claims and questions of\nlaw.[4]IIUndeterred by the statute\u2019s text and\nstructure, the majority concludes that criminal aliens are entitled\nto judicial review of any question involving the application of\nestablished facts to a legal standard.Ante, at 1\u20132. Even a\nfact-intensive mixed question like due diligence, which requires\n\u201c[p]recious little\u201d \u201clegal work,\u201dVillage at Lakeridge, 583\nU.\u00a0S.,at ___ (slip op., at 10), is a \u201cquestion of law\u201d\naccording to the majority. To justify its erroneous reading of the\ntext, the majority resorts to the presumption favoring judicial\nreview and to legislative intent. Neither interpretive tool is\nappropriate for, or helpful to, the majority\u2019s analysis.AThe majority relies heavily on the presumption\nfavoring judicial review of agency action as set out in our modern\ncases.Ante,at 5\u20137. Even accepting those precedents, which\nno party asks us to reconsider, the presumption does no work here\nbecause the statute\u2019s text and structure plainly preclude review of\nmixed questions.1As an initial matter, I have come to have\ndoubts about our modern cases applying the presumption of\nreviewability. Courts have long understood that they \u201cgenerally\nhave jurisdiction to grant relief\u00a0\u201d when individuals are\ninjured by unlawful administrative action.American School of\nMagnetic Healingv.McAnnulty,187 U.S.\n94, 108 (1902). Applying this well-settled principle, we have\nrefused to read a statute\u2019s \u201csilence .\u00a0.\u00a0. as to judicial\nreview\u201d to preclude such review.Starkv.Wickard,321 U.S.\n288, 309 (1944); see alsoBoard of Governors, FRSv.Agnew,329 U.S.\n441, 444 (1947). But the modern presumption of reviewability\nrelied on by the majority today goes far beyond this traditional\napproach.The modern presumption developed against the\nbackdrop of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). SeeAbbott\nLaboratoriesv.Gardner,387 U.S.\n136, 140\u2013141 (1967); see alsoWeyerhaeuser Co.v.United States Fish and Wildlife Serv., 586 U.\u00a0S. ___,\n___ (2018) (slip op., at 11). In that statute, Congress created a\ngeneral right of judicial review for individuals injured by agency\naction. 5 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7702. Notably, however, Congress also\nspecified that this right did not apply when \u201cstatutes preclude\njudicial review.\u201d \u00a7701(a)(1).Rather than recognize that courts should give\nthe words of both the APA and agencies\u2019 organic statutes their\nnatural meaning, the Court relied on \u201c[t]he spirit of\n[legislators\u2019] statements\u201d in Committee Reports and the \u201cbroadly\nremedial purposes of the [APA]\u201d to craft a strong presumption of\nreviewability.Heikkilav.Barber,345 U.S.\n229, 232 (1953). The Court ultimately concluded that statutory\ntext alone, even that which \u201cappears to bar [judicial review],\u201d is\n\u201cnot conclusive.\u201dId.,at 233. Under this approach, a court\nwill yield its jurisdiction \u201conly upon a showing of \u2018clear and\nconvincing evidence,\u2019\u00a0\u201d drawn from a statute\u2019s purpose and\nlegislative history, that Congress \u201cintended\u201d as much.Abbott\nLaboratories,supra, at 139, 141; see alsoante,\nat 6.There are at least three reasons to doubt the\nsoundness of this modern presumption. First, it elevates the\nsupposed purpose or \u201cspirit\u201d of the APA over the statute\u2019s text.\nThe \u201cspirit\u201d of a law is nothing more than \u201cthe unhappy\ninterpretive conception of a supposedly better policy than can be\nfound in the words of [the] authoritative text.\u201d A. Scalia & B.\nGarner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 344 (2012).\nIts invocation represents a \u201cbald assertion of an unspecified and\nhence unbounded judicial power to ignore what the law says.\u201dId., at 343. And it is especially problematic to rely on the\n\u201cspirit\u201d of the APA in actions arising under a separate substantive\nstatute with a judicial-review provision that is entirely distinct\nfrom the APA, such as the INA.Second, the Court\u2019s test for rebutting the\npresumption relies heavily on legislative intent, inviting courts\nto discern the mental processes of legislators through legislative\nhistory. But \u201c[e]ven assuming a majority of Congress read the\n[legislative history], agreed with it, and voted for [the statute]\nwith the same intent, \u2018we are a government of laws, not of men, and\nare governed by what Congress enacted rather than by what it\nintended.\u2019\u00a0\u201dDigital Realty Trust, Inc.v.Somers, 583 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2018) (Thomas, J.,\nconcurring in part and concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 1)\n(quotingLawsonv.FMR LLC,571\nU.S. 429, 459\u2013460 (2014) (Scalia, J., concurring in principal\npart and concurring in judgment)).Finally, the clear-and-convincing-evidence\nrequirement appears to conflict with the text of the Constitution.\nUnder Articles I and III, Congress has the authority to establish\nthe jurisdiction of inferior federal courts and to regulate the\nappellate jurisdiction of this Court. See Art.\u00a0I, \u00a78,\ncl.\u00a09; Art.\u00a0III, \u00a72, cl.\u00a02; see alsoPatchakv.Zinke, 583 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___\u2013___ (2018) (slip op., at\n7\u201310). It occasionally wields this power to prevent federal courts\nfrom reviewing certain actions through jurisdiction-stripping\nstatutes. See,e.g.,12 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a71818(i)(1),\n4208; 15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7719h(c)(3); 31 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a73730(e)(4)(A). Using this modern presumption, however, the Court\nhas reached the opposite result, despite a statute\u2019s plain text.\nSee,e.g., INSv.St. Cyr,533\nU.S. 289(2001); see alsoante, at 6\u20137. By placing\nheightened requirements on statutes promulgated under Congress\u2019\nexclusive authority rather than simply giving effect to their\nordinary meaning, courts upset the delicate balance of power\nreflected in the Constitution\u2019s text.2Even assuming that the modern presumption is\njustified and can properly be applied to actions outside the APA\ncontext, it does no work in these cases. First, as explained above,\n\u201cquestions of law\u201d cannot reasonably be read to include mixed\nquestions. Seesupra, at 3\u20136; cf.Kucanav.Holder,558 U.S.\n233, 251 (2010). But even if it could, the sweeping language of\n\u00a71252(a)(2)(C) provides clear and convincing evidence that judicial\nreview of mixed questions is barred. The broad language of that\nprovision leaves no room for ambiguity as to Congress\u2019 design. In\nerecting the criminal-alien bar, Congress unequivocally precluded\njudicial review of wide swaths of claims. The presumption, to the\nextent it should apply here at all, is thus firmly rebutted.The Court nevertheless concludes that the\npresumption of reviewability dictates today\u2019s result. It bases this\nconclusion on the observation that \u201cinterpreting [\u00a71252(a)(2)(D)]\nto exclude mixed questions would effectively foreclose judicial\nreview of the Board\u2019s determinations so long as it announced the\ncorrect legal standard.\u201dAnte, at 6\u20137. But \u201c[t]he resulting\nbarrier to meaningful judicial review\u201d is not a problem in need of\na judicial solution,ante,at 7\u2014it is evidence of Congress\u2019\ndesign, which is precisely the sort of \u201cclear and convincing\nevidence\u201d that should \u201cdislodge the presumption,\u201dKucana,supra, at 252 (internal quotation marks omitted). By using\nCongress\u2019 preclusive design tojustifyrather than dislodge\nthe presumption, the majority dramatically expands the presumption,\nrendering it effectively irrebuttable.BThe majority next relies on the purported\npurpose of \u00a71252(a)(2)(D) to justify its reading of the text. It\nclaims that Congress intended to provide an \u201c\u00a0\u2018adequate\nsubstitute\u2019 for habeas in view ofSt. Cyr\u2019s guidance\u201d\nregarding the scope of the Suspension Clause.Ante, at 10.\nAs explained above, legislative intent, to the extent it exists\nindependent of the words in the statute, is unhelpful to the proper\ninterpretation of a statute\u2019s text. Seesupra, at 8. But its\ninvocation is especially unhelpful to the majority here. Even\nassuming Congress looked toSt. Cyrwhen drafting\n\u00a71252(a)(2)(D), the limited \u201cguidance\u201d provided in that opinion\nsupports my reading of the statute, not the majority\u2019s.As an initial matter, the Court inSt.\nCyrexpressly declined to resolve \u201cthe difficult question of\nwhat the Suspension Clause protects.\u201dSt. Cyr, 533\nU.\u00a0S., at 301, n.\u00a013. Respondent in that case argued that\n\u00a71252(a)(2)(C) would violate the Suspension Clause if it were read\nto preclude review of all questions of law in habeas proceedings.\nBut rather than affirm that position, the Court concluded that it\nwas enough to merely identify that \u201csubstantial constitutional\nquestio[n]\u201d to warrant rejection of the Government\u2019s\ninterpretation.Id., at 300. Indeed, the meaning of the\nSuspension Clause and its applicability to removal proceedings\nremain open questions. SeeDepartment of Homeland Securityv.Thuraissigiam,post, p. ___ (2019) (granting\ncertiorari). In explaining its decision, the Court inSt.\nCyrmerely asserted that the Suspension Clause \u201cprotects the\nwrit as it existed in 1789\u201d and noted that \u201cthere is substantial\nevidence .\u00a0.\u00a0. thatpure questions of law\u201d were\ngenerally covered by the common-law writ. 533 U.\u00a0S., at 301,\n304\u2013305 (emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted). The\ndecision said nothing about mixed questions or the application of\nsettled facts to a legal standard.The majority relies on one sentence of dicta inSt. Cyr, which states that the common-law writ addressed\n\u201cthe erroneous application or interpretation of statutes.\u201dId., at 302; seeante,at 9. But the application of a\nstatute does not always involve applying facts to a legal standard,\nnor is it necessarily analogous to the equitable and fact-intensive\ndue-diligence inquiry.The majority next suggests that Congress was\nfamiliar with the underlying details of common-law cases cited inSt. Cyr,ante, at 9, or the lower court decisions\nexpanding onSt. Cyr\u2019s dicta,ante, at 10. But such a\n\u201cfanciful presumption of legislative knowledge\u201d cannot justify the\nmajority\u2019s position. Scalia, Reading Law, at 324.[5] And if Congress were presumed to have such\na robust knowledge of our precedents, one would certainly expect it\nto be familiar with our historical practice of using \u201cquestions of\nlaw\u201d and \u201cmixed questions\u201d as distinct terms. Seesupra, at\n3.The only guidance provided bySt. Cyr\u2019s\ndicta concerned \u201cpure questions of law.\u201d 533 U.\u00a0S., at 305;\nsee alsoid., at 314, n.\u00a038 (\u201cthis case raises only a\npure question of law .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0, not .\u00a0.\u00a0. an\nobjection to the manner in which discretion was exercised\u201d). So\neven if it were appropriate to assume that Congress enacted\n\u00a71252(a)(2)(D) with the collective intention of followingSt.\nCyr\u2019s guidance (which it is not), that statutory purpose\nsupports reading \u201cquestions of law\u201d to mean just that: \u201cquestions\nof law.\u201d*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*Ironically, the majority refers to\n\u00a71252(a)(2)(D) as the \u201cLimited Review Provision.\u201dAnte, at\n1. But according to the majority\u2019s interpretation, it is anything\nbut \u201climited\u201d\u2014nearly all claims are reviewable. That reading\ncontradicts the plain text and structure of \u00a71252(a)(2), which was\nenacted to strip federal courts of their jurisdiction to review\nmost criminal aliens\u2019 claims challenging removal proceedings. The\nConstitution gives the Legislative Branch the authority to curtail\nthat jurisdiction. We cannot simply invoke this presumption of\nreviewability to circumvent Congress\u2019 decision. Doing so upsets,\nnot preserves, the separation of powers reflected in the\nConstitution\u2019s text. I respectfully dissent.Notes1The majority also citesMitchellv.Forsyth,472 U.S.\n511(1985), for the proposition that \u201cwhether a given set of\nfacts meet a particular legal standard .\u00a0.\u00a0. present[s] a\nlegal inquiry.\u201dAnte,at 4. But that case involved a motion\nfor summary judgment, so the inquiry was limited to whether \u201ca\ngiven proposition of law was not clearly established at the time\nthe defendant committed the alleged acts.\u201d 472 U.\u00a0S., at 529,\nn.\u00a010. It did not concern the application of facts to a legal\nstandard, such as whether \u201cthe defendant\u2019s actions were in fact\nunlawful.\u201dIbid.2Even if this statute were\ninterpreted in terms of a fact/law dichotomy, the majority offers\nno explanation as to why the due-diligence inquiry would fall on\nthe \u201cprimarily legal\u201d side of the line.3The majority claims we\nmust read \u00a71252(a)(2)(C) \u201cin th[e] context\u201d of the purported\nlegislative intent behind \u00a71252(a)(2)(D).Ante, at 12. As\nexplained below, atextual legislative intent is not an appropriate\ntool for interpreting a statute. Seeinfra, at 8. But even\nif it were, the purported legislative intent here supports a narrow\nreading of \u00a71252(a)(2)(D) that leaves much of \u00a71252(a)(2)(C)\nintact. Seeinfra, at 10\u201312.4The majority makes much\nof the phrase \u201cquestions of law and fact\u201d in another subsection of\n\u00a71252, known as the \u201czipper clause,\u201d which consolidates judicial\nreview of immigration proceedings.Ante, at 7\u20138 (discussing\n8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71252(b)(9)). But that language is most\nnaturally read to encompass all three categories\u2014\u201cquestions of\nlaw,\u201d \u201cquestions of .\u00a0.\u00a0. fact,\u201d and \u201cquestions of law\nand fact.\u201d \u00a71252(b)(9).At a minimum, the meaning of the\nzipper clause\u2019s text is ambiguous and cannot overcome the plain\ntext of \u00a7\u00a71252(a)(2)(C)\u2013(D).5To support its reliance\non this presumption, the majority citesMerck & Co.v.Reynolds,559 U.S.\n633(2010). But that case presumed that when Congress used a\nspecific term it imported a particular meaning that courts had\ngiven the term through uniform interpretation. Seeid., at\n647\u2013648. The majority goes much further here, claiming that\nCongress\u2019 \u201cintent\u201d was to give effect to lower courts\u2019\ninterpretations of this Court\u2019s dicta.Ante, at 11. Contrary\nto the majority\u2019s suggestion, nothing in the legislative history\nindicates that Congress relied on lower courts\u2019 interpretations ofSt. Cyrin enacting \u00a71252(a)(2)(D). Congress merely\nhighlighted the \u201cconfusion in the federal courts\u201d as one of \u201cthe\nmany problems caused bySt. Cyr.\u201d H.\u00a0R. Conf. Rep. No.\n109\u201372, pp. 173\u2013174 (2005). Notably, the Report also stated that\n\u201cthe most significant [problem]\u201d was \u201cthat [the] decision allow[ed]\ncriminal aliens to delay their expulsion from the United States for\nyears.\u201dId.,at 173. Thus, even if one could divine a shared\nlegislative intent by reading this Conference Report, it would\nappear that Congress intended to streamline removal proceedings by\nlimiting judicial review to the greatest extent possible underSt. Cyr.",
