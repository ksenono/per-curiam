The Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision was based on the\nprocedure used by the trial judge in ruling on Ayala\u2019s objections\nunderBatsonv.Kentucky, 476 U.\u00a0S. 79 (1986) ,\nto some of the prosecution\u2019s peremptory challenges of prospective\njurors. The trial judge allowed the prosecutor to explain the basis\nfor those strikes outside the presence of the defense so as not to\ndisclose trial strategy. On direct appeal, the California Supreme\nCourt found that if this procedure violated any federal\nconstitutional right, the error was harmless beyond a reasonable\ndoubt. The Ninth Circuit, however, held that the error was\nharmful.The Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision was based on the\nmisapplication of basic rules regarding harmless error. Assuming\nwithout deciding that a federal constitutional error occurred, the\nerror was harmless underBrechtv.Abrahamson, 507\nU.\u00a0S. 619 (1993) , and the Antiterrorism and Effective Death\nPenalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72254(d).IAAyala\u2019s conviction resulted from the attempted\nrobbery of an automobile body shop in San Diego, California, in\nApril 1985. The prosecution charged Ayala with three counts of\nmurder, one count of attempted murder, one count of robbery, and\nthree counts of attempted robbery. The prosecution also announced\nthat it would seek the death penalty on the murder counts.Jury selection lasted more than three months,\nand during this time the court and the parties interviewed the\nprospective jurors and then called back a subset for generalvoir\u00a0dire. As part of the jury selection process, more\nthan 200 potential jurors completed a 77-question, 17-page\nquestionnaire. Potential jurors were then questioned in court\nregarding their ability to follow the law. Jurors who were not\ndismissed for cause were called back in groups forvoir\u00a0dire, and the parties exercised their peremptory\nchallenges.Each side was allowed 20 peremptories, and the\nprosecution used 18 of its allotment. It used seven peremptories to\nstrike all of the African-Americans and Hispanics who were\navailable for service. Ayala, who is Hispanic, raisedBatsonobjections to those challenges.Ayala first objected after the prosecution\nperemptorily challenged two African-Americans, Olanders D. and\nGalileo S. The trial judge stated that these two strikes failed to\nestablish a prima facie case of racial discrimination, but he\nnevertheless required the prosecution to reveal the reasons for the\nstrikes. The prosecutor asked to do this outside the presence of\nthe defense so as not to disclose trial strategy, and over Ayala\u2019s\nobjection, the judgegranted the request. The prosecution then\noffered several reasons for striking Olanders D., including\nuncertainty about his willingness to impose the death penalty. The\nprosecution stated that it dismissed Galileo S. primarily because\nhe had been arrested numerous times and had not informed the court\nabout all his prior arrests. After hearing and evaluating these\nexplanations, the judge concluded that the prosecution had valid,\nrace-neutral reasons for these strikes.Ayala again raisedBatsonobjections when\nthe prosecution used peremptory challenges to dismiss two\nHispanics, Gerardo O. and Luis M. As before, the judge found that\nthe defense had not made out a prima facie case, but ordered the\nprosecution to reveal the reasons for the strikes. This was again\ndoneex\u00a0parte, but this time the defense did not\nexpressly object. The prosecution explained that it had challenged\nGerardo O. and Luis M. in part because it was unsure that they\ncould impose the death penalty. The prosecution also emphasized\nthat Gerardo O.\u2019s English proficiency was limited and that Luis M.\nhad independently investigated the case. The trial court concluded\na second time that the prosecution had legitimate race-neutral\nreasons for the strikes.Ayala raisedBatsonobjections for a\nthird and final time when the prosecution challenged Robert M., who\nwas Hispanic; George S., whose ethnicity was disputed; and Barbara\nS., who was African-American. At this point, the trial court agreed\nthat Ayala had made a prima facieBatsonshowing. Ayala\u2019s\ncounsel argued that the strikes were in fact based on race. Ayala\u2019s\ncounsel contended that the challenged jurors were \u201cnot\nsignificantly different from the white jurors that the prosecution\nha[d] chosen to leave on the jury both in terms of their attitudes\non the death penalty, their attitudes on the criminal justice\nsystem, and their attitudes on the presumption of innocence.\u201d App.\n306. Ayala\u2019s counsel then reviewed the questionnaire answers andvoir\u00a0diretestimony of Barbara S. and Robert M., as\nwell as the statements made by three of the prospective jurors who\nhad been the subject of the priorBatsonobjections, Galileo\nS., Gerardo O., and Luis M. Counsel argued that their answers\nshowed that they could impose the death penalty. The trial court\nstated that it would hear the prosecution\u2019s response outside the\npresence of the jury, and Ayala once more did not object to that\nruling. The prosecution then explained that it had dismissed the\nprospective jurors in question for several race-neutral reasons,\nincluding uncertainty that Robert M., George S., or Barbara S.\nwould be open to imposing the death penalty. The prosecution also\nemphasized (among other points) that Robert M. had followed a\ncontroversial trial, that George S. had been a holdout on a prior\njury, and that Barbara S. had given the impression duringvoir\u00a0direthat she was under the influence of drugs.\nThe trial court concluded, for a third time, that the prosecution\u2019s\nperemptory challenges were based on race-neutral criteria.In August 1989, the jury convicted Ayala of all\nthe charges except one of the three attempted robberies. With\nrespect to the three murder convictions, the jury found two special\ncircumstances: Ayala committed multiple murders, and he killed\nduring the course of an attempted robbery. The jury returned a\nverdict of death on all three murder counts, and the trial court\nentered judgment consistent with that verdict.BAyala appealed his conviction and sentence,\nand counsel was appointed to represent him in January 1993. Between\n1993 and 1999, Ayala filed 20 applications for an extension of\ntime, 11 of which requested additional time to file his opening\nbrief. After the California Supreme Court eventually ruled that no\nfurther extensions would be granted, Ayala filed his opening brief\nin April 1998, nine years after he was convicted. The State filed\nits brief in September 1998, and Ayala then asked for four\nextensions of time to file his reply brief. After the court\ndeclared that it would grant him no further extensions, he filed\nhis reply brief in May 1999.In August 2000, the California Supreme Court\naffirmed Ayala\u2019s conviction and death sentence.Peoplev.Ayala, 24 Cal. 4th 243, 6 P.\u00a03d 193. In an opinion\njoined by five justices, the State Supreme Court rejected Ayala\u2019s\ncontention that the trial court committed reversible error by\nexcluding the defense from part of theBatsonhearing. The\ncourt understood Ayala to challenge the peremptory strikes under\nbothBatsonand its state-law analogue,Peoplev.Wheeler, 22 Cal. 3d 258, 583 P.\u00a02d 748 (1978). The\ncourt first concluded that the prosecution had not offered matters\nof trial strategy at theex partehearing and that, \u201cas a\nmatter of state law, it was [error]\u201d to bar Ayala\u2019s attorney from\nthe hearing. 24 Cal. 4th, at 262, 6 P.\u00a03d, at 203.Turning to the question of prejudice, the court\nstated:\u201cWe have concluded that error occurred\nunder state law, and we have noted [the suggestion inUnited\nStatesv.Thompson, 827 F.\u00a02d 1254 (CA9 1987),]\nthat excluding the defense from aWheeler-type hearing may\namount to a denial of due process. We nonetheless conclude that the\nerror was harmless under state law (Peoplev.Watson(1956) 46 Cal.2d 818, 836), and that, if federal error occurred,\nit, too, was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt (Chapmanv.California(1967) 386 U.\u00a0S. 18 ) as a matter of federal\nlaw. On the record before us, we are confident that the challenged\njurors were excluded for proper, race-neutral reasons.\u201dId.,\nat 264, 6 P.\u00a03d, at 204.The court then reviewed the prosecution\u2019s\nreasons for striking the seven prospective jurors and found that\n\u201c[o]n this well-developed record, .\u00a0.\u00a0. we are confident\nthat defense counsel could not have argued anything substantial\nthat would have changed the court\u2019s rulings. Accordingly, the error\nwas harmless.\u201dId., at 268, 6 P.\u00a03d, at 207. The court\nconcluded that the record supported the trial judge\u2019s implicit\ndetermination that the prosecution\u2019s justifications were not\nfabricated and were instead \u201cgrounded in fact.\u201dId.,at 267,\n6 P.\u00a03d, at 206. And the court emphasized that the \u201ctrial\ncourt\u2019s rulings in the ex\u00a0parte hearing indisputably reflect\nboth its familiarity with the record of voir\u00a0dire of the\nchallenged prospective jurors and its critical assessment of the\nprosecutor\u2019s proffered justifications.\u201dId.,at 266\u2013267, 6\nP.\u00a03d, at 206.The California Supreme Court also rejected\nAyala\u2019s argument that his conviction should be vacated because most\nof the questionnaires filled out by prospective jurors who did not\nserve had been lost at some point during the decade that had passed\nsince the end of the trial. The court wrote that \u201cthe record is\nsufficiently complete for us to be able to conclude that [the\nprospective jurors who were the subject of the contested\nperemptories] were not challenged and excused on the basis of\nforbidden group bias.\u201dId., at 270, 6 P.\u00a03d, at 208.\nAnd even if the loss of the questionnaires was error under federal\nor state law, the court held, the error was harmless underChapmanand its state-law analogue. Two justices of the\nState Supreme Court dissented. We then denied certiorari. 532\nU.\u00a0S. 1029 (2001) .CAfter the California Supreme Court summarily\ndenied a habeas petition, Ayala turned to federal court. He filed\nhis initial federal habeas petition in 2002, but then went back to\nstate court to exhaust several claims. In December 2004, he filed\nthe operative federal petition and argued, among other things, that\ntheex\u00a0partehearings and loss of the questionnaires\nviolated his rights under the Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth\nAmendments.In 2006, the District Court denied Ayala relief\non those claims. The District Court read the decision of the\nCalifornia Supreme Court to mean that the state court had not\ndecided whether theex\u00a0parteproceedings violated\nfederal law, and the District Court expressed doubt \u201cwhether the\ntrial court\u2019s procedure was constitutionally defective as a matter\nof clearly established Federal law.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 145a.\nBut even if such a violation occurred, the District Court held, the\nstate court\u2019s finding of harmlessness was not contrary to or an\nunreasonable application of clearly established law and thus could\nnot be overturned under AEDPA. The District Court also rejected\nAyala\u2019s argument about the lost questionnaires, concluding that,\neven without them, the record was sufficient to resolve Ayala\u2019s\nother claims.In 2013, a divided panel of the Ninth Circuit\ngranted Ayala federal habeas corpus relief and required California\neither to release or retry him.Ayalav.Wong, 756\nF.\u00a03d 656 (2014). Because Ayala\u2019s federal petition is subject\nto the requirements of AEDPA, the panel majority began its analysis\nby inquiring whether the state court had adjudicated Ayala\u2019s claims\non the merits. Applyingde novoreview,[1] the panel held that theex\u00a0parteproceedings violated the Federal Constitution, and that the loss of\nthe questionnaires violated Ayala\u2019s federal due process rights if\nthat loss deprived him of \u201cthe ability to meaningfully appeal the\ndenial of hisBatsonclaim.\u201dId.,at 671. Thepanel folded this inquiry into its analysis of\nthe question whether the error regarding theex\u00a0parteproceedings was harmless.Turning to the question of harmlessness, the\npanel identified the applicable standard of review as that set out\ninBrechtand added: \u201cWe apply theBrechttest\nwithout regard for the state court\u2019s harmlessness determination.\u201d\n756 F.\u00a03d, at 674 (internal quotation marks omitted).[2] The panel used the following\ncomplicated formulation to express its understanding ofBrecht\u2019s application to Ayala\u2019s claims: \u201cIf we cannot say\nthat the exclusion of defense counsel with or without the loss of\nthe questionnaires likely did not prevent Ayala from prevailing on\nhisBatsonclaim, then we must grant the writ.\u201d 756\nF.\u00a03d, at 676. Applying this test, the panel majority found\nthat the error was not harmless, at least with respect to three of\nthe seven prospective jurors. The panel asserted that the absence\nof Ayala and his counsel had interfered with the trial court\u2019s\nability to evaluate the prosecution\u2019s proffered justifications for\nthose strikes and had impeded appellate review, and that the loss\nof the questionnaires had compounded this impairment.Judge Callahan dissented. She explained that the\nCalifornia Supreme Court\u2019s decision that any federal error was\nharmless constituted a merits adjudication of Ayala\u2019s federal\nclaims. She then reviewed the prosecution\u2019s explanations for its\ncontested peremptory challenges and concluded that federal habeas\nrelief was barred because \u201cfairminded jurists can concur in the\nCalifornia Supreme Court\u2019s determination of harmless error.\u201dId.,at 706.The Ninth Circuit denied rehearing en banc, but\nJudge Ikuta wrote a dissent from denial that was joined by seven\nother judges. Like Judge Callahan, Judge Ikuta concluded that the\nCalifornia Supreme Court adjudicated the merits of Ayala\u2019s federal\nclaims. Instead of the panel\u2019s \u201cde\u00a0novo review of the record\nthat piles speculation upon speculation,\u201d she would have found that\nthe state court\u2019s harmlessness determination was not an\nunreasonable application ofChapman. 756 F.\u00a03d, at\n723.We granted certiorari. 574 U.\u00a0S. ___\n(2014).IIAyala contends that his federal constitutional\nrights were violated when the trial court heard the prosecution\u2019s\njustifications for its strikes outside the presence of the defense,\nbut we find it unnecessary to decide that question. We assume for\nthe sake of argument that Ayala\u2019s federal rights were violated, but\nthat does not necessarily mean that he is entitled to habeas\nrelief. In the absence of \u201cthe rare type of error\u201d that requires\nautomatic reversal, relief is appropriate only if the prosecution\ncannot demonstrate harmlessness.Glebev.Frost, 574\nU.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2014) (per curiam) (slip op., at 3).\nThe Ninth Circuit did not hold\u2014and Ayala does not now contend\u2014that\nthe error here falls into that narrow category, and therefore Ayala\nis entitled to relief only if the error was not harmless.The test for whether a federal constitutional\nerror was harmless depends on the procedural posture of the case.\nOn direct appeal, the harmlessness standard is the one prescribed\ninChapman, 386 U.\u00a0S. 18 : \u201c[B]efore a federal\nconstitutional error can be held harmless, the court must be able\nto declare a belief that it was harmless beyond a reasonable\ndoubt.\u201dId.,at 24.In a collateral proceeding, the test is\ndifferent. For reasons of finality, comity, and federalism, habeas\npetitioners \u201care not entitled to habeas relief based on trial error\nunless they can establish that it resulted in \u2018actual\nprejudice.\u2019\u00a0\u201dBrecht, 507 U.\u00a0S., at 637 (quotingUnited Statesv.Lane, 474 U.\u00a0S. 438, 449 (1986)\n). Under this test, relief is proper only if the federal court has\n\u201cgrave doubt about whether a trial error of federal law had\n\u2018substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the\njury\u2019s verdict.\u2019\u00a0\u201dO\u2019Nealv.McAninch, 513\nU.\u00a0S. 432, 436 (1995) . There must be more than a \u201creasonable\npossibility\u201d that the error was harmful.Brecht,supra, at 637 (internal quotation marks omitted). TheBrechtstandard reflects the view that a \u201cState is not to be\nput to th[e] arduous task [of retrying a defendant] based on mere\nspeculation that the defendant was prejudiced by trial error; the\ncourt must find that the defendant was actually prejudiced by the\nerror.\u201dCalderonv.Coleman, 525 U.\u00a0S. 141, 146\n(1998) (per curiam).Because Ayala seeks federal habeas corpus\nrelief, he must meet theBrechtstandard, but that does not\nmean, as the Ninth Circuit thought, that a state court\u2019s\nharmlessness determination has no significance underBrecht.\nInFryv.Pliler, 551 U.\u00a0S. 112, 120 (2007) , we\nheld that theBrechtstandard \u201csubsumes\u201d the requirements\nthat \u00a72254(d) imposes when a federal habeas petitioner contests a\nstate court\u2019s determination that a constitutional error was\nharmless underChapman. TheFryCourt did not\nhold\u2014and would have had no possible basis for holding\u2014thatBrechtsomehow abrogates the limitation on federal habeas\nrelief that \u00a72254(d) plainly sets out. While a federal habeas court\nneed not \u201cformal[ly]\u201d apply bothBrechtand\n\u201cAEDPA/Chapman,\u201dAEDPA nevertheless \u201csets forth a\nprecondition to the grant of habeas relief.\u201dFry,supra, at 119\u2013120.Under AEDPA, 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72254(d):\u201cAn application for a writ of habeas\ncorpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of\na State court shall not be granted with respect to any claim that\nwas adjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings unless the\nadjudication of the claim\u2014\u201c(1) resulted in a decision that was\ncontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly\nestablished Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the\nUnited States; or\u201c(2) resulted in a decision that was based\non an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the\nevidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201dSection 2254(d) thus demands an inquiry into\nwhether a prisoner\u2019s \u201cclaim\u201d has been \u201cadjudicated on the merits\u201d\nin state court; if it has, AEDPA\u2019s highly deferential standards\nkick in.Harringtonv.Richter, 562 U.\u00a0S. 86,\n103 (2011) .At issue here is Ayala\u2019s claim that theex\u00a0parteportion of theBatsonhearings violated\nthe Federal Constitution. There is no dispute that the California\nSupreme Court held that any federal error was harmless beyond a\nreasonable doubt underChapman, and this decision\nundoubtedly constitutes an adjudication of Ayala\u2019s constitutional\nclaim \u201con the merits.\u201d See,e.g., Mitchellv.Esparza, 540 U.\u00a0S. 12 \u201318 (2003) (per curiam).\nAccordingly, a federal habeas court cannot grant Ayala relief\nunless the state court\u2019s rejection of his claim (1) was contrary to\nor involved an unreasonable application of clearly established\nfederal law, or (2) was based on an unreasonable determination of\nthe facts. Because the highly deferential AEDPA standard applies,\nwe may not overturn the California Supreme Court\u2019s decision unless\nthat court appliedChapman\u201cin an \u2018objectively unreasonable\u2019\nmanner.\u201dId., at 18 (quotingLockyerv.Andrade, 538 U.\u00a0S. 63, 75 (2003) ). When aChapmandecision is reviewed under AEDPA, \u201ca federal court\nmay not award habeas relief under \u00a72254 unlessthe harmlessness\ndetermination itselfwas unreasonable.\u201dFry,supra, at 119 (emphasis in original). And a state-court\ndecision is not unreasonable if \u201c\u00a0\u2018fairminded jurists could\ndisagree\u2019 on [its] correctness.\u201dRichter,supra, at\n101 (quotingYarboroughv.Alvarado, 541 U.\u00a0S.\n652, 664 (2004) ). Ayala therefore must show that the state court\u2019s\ndecision to reject his claim \u201cwas so lacking in justification that\nthere was an error well understood and comprehended in existing law\nbeyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.\u201d 562\nU.\u00a0S., at 103.In sum, a prisoner who seeks federal habeas\ncorpus relief must satisfyBrecht, and if the state court\nadjudi-cated his claim on the merits, theBrechttest\nsubsumes the limitations imposed by AEDPA.Fry,supra, at 119\u2013120.IIIWith this background in mind, we turn to the\nquestion whether Ayala was harmed by the trial court\u2019s decision to\nreceive the prosecution\u2019s explanation for its challenged strikes\nwithout the defense present. In order for this argument to succeed,\nAyala must show that he was actually prejudiced by this procedure,\na standard that he neces-sarily cannot satisfy if a fairminded\njurist could agree with the California Supreme Court\u2019s decision\nthat this procedure met theChapmanstandard of\nharmlessness. Evaluation of these questions requires consideration\nof the trial court\u2019s grounds for rejecting Ayala\u2019sBatsonchallenges.ABatsonheld that the Equal Protection\nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits prosecutors from\nexercising peremptory challenges on the basis of race. 476\nU.\u00a0S., at 89. When adjudicating aBatsonclaim, trial\ncourts follow a three-step process:\u201cFirst, a defendant must make a prima\nfacie showing that a peremptory challenge has been exercised on the\nbasis of race; second, if that showing has been made, the\nprosecution must offer a race-neutral basis for striking the juror\nin question; and third, in light of the parties\u2019 submissions, the\ntrial court must determine whether the defendant has shown\npurposeful discrimination.\u201dSnyderv.Louisiana, 552\nU.\u00a0S. 472 \u2013477 (2008) (internal quotation marks and\nalterations omitted).The opponent of the strike bears the burden of\npersuasion regarding racial motivation,Purkettv.Elem, 514 U.\u00a0S. 765, 768 (1995) (per curiam),\nand a trial court finding regarding the credibility of an\nattorney\u2019s explanation of the ground for a peremptory challenge is\n\u201centitled to \u2018great deference,\u2019\u00a0\u201dFelknerv.Jackson, 562 U.\u00a0S. 594, 598 (2011) (per curiam)\n(quotingBatson, 476 U.\u00a0S., at 98, n. 21). On direct\nappeal, those findings may be reversed only if the trial judge is\nshown to have committed clear error.Ricev.Collins,\n546 U.\u00a0S. 333, 338 (2006) . Under AEDPA, even more must be\nshown. A federal habeas court must accept a state-court finding\nunless it was based on \u201can unreasonable determination of the facts\nin light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d\n\u00a72254(d)(2). \u201cState-court factual findings, moreover, are presumed\ncorrect; the petitioner has the burden of rebutting the presumption\nby \u2018clear and convincing evidence.\u2019\u00a0\u201dCollins,supra, at 338\u2013339 (quoting \u00a72254(e)(1)).In this case, Ayala challenged seven of the\nprosecution\u2019s peremptory challenges. As explained above, the Ninth\nCircuit granted relief based on the dismissal of three potential\njurors. The dissent discusses only one, Olanders D. We will devote\nmost of our analysis to the three individuals discussed by the\nNinth Circuit, but we hold that any error was harmless with respect\nto all seven strikes.B1Ayala first contests the prosecution\u2019s\ndecision to challenge Olanders D., an African-American man. The\nprosecution stated that its \u201cprimary\u201d reason for striking Olanders\nD. was uncertainty about whether he could impose the death penalty,\nand the prosecutor noted that Olanders D. had written on his\nquestionnaire that he did not \u201cbelieve in the death penalty.\u201d 50\nReporter\u2019s Tr. on Appeal 6185 (hereinafter Tr.). Providing\nadditional reasons for this strike, the prosecutor first stated\nthat Olanders D.\u2019s responses \u201cdid not make a lot of sense,\u201d \u201cwere\nnot thought out,\u201d and \u201cdemonstrate[d] a lack of ability to express\nhimself well.\u201d App. 283. The prosecutor also voiced doubt that\nOlanders D. \u201ccould actively participate in a meaningful way in\ndeliberations with other jurors\u201d and might have lacked the \u201cability\nto fit in with a cohesive group of 12 people.\u201dIbid.The trial court concluded that the strike was\nrace-neutral. The judge stated: \u201cCertainly with reference to\nwhether or not he would get along with 12 people, it may well be\nthat he would get along very well with 12 people. I think the other\nobservations of counsel are accurate and borne out by the record.\u201d\n50 Tr. 6186. The California Supreme Court found that the evidence\nof Olanders D.\u2019s views on the death penalty provided adequate\nsupport for the trial judge\u2019s finding that the strike exercised\nagainst him was not based on race, and the court further found that\ndefense counsel\u2019s presence would not have affected the outcome of\ntheBatsonhearing. The Ninth Circuit reversed, but its\ndecision rested on a misapplication of the applicable\nharmless-error standards.2As the trial court and the State Supreme Court\nfound, Olanders D.\u2019svoir\u00a0direresponses amply support\nthe prosecution\u2019s concern that he might not have been willing to\nimpose the death penalty. Duringvoir\u00a0dire, Olanders D.\nacknowledged that he wrote on his questionnaire, \u201c\u00a0\u2018I don\u2019t\nbelieve in the death penalty,\u2019\u00a0\u201d App. 179, and he agreed that\nhe had at one time \u201cthought that [the death penalty] was completely\nwrong,\u201did.,at 177. Although he stated during thevoir\u00a0direthat he had reconsidered his views, it was\nreasonable for the prosecution and the trial court to find that he\ndid not clearly or adequately explain the reason or reasons for\nthis change. When asked about this, Olanders D. gave a vague and\nrambling reply: \u201cWell, I think it\u2019s\u2014one thing would be the\u2014the\u2014I\nmean, examining it more closely, I think, and becoming more\nfamiliar with the laws and the\u2014and the behavior, I mean, the change\nin the people, I think. All of those things contributed to the\nchanges.\u201dId.,at 178.The Ninth Circuit reversed because it speculated\nthat defense counsel, if present when the prosecution explained the\nbasis for this strike, \u201ccould have pointed to seated white jurors\nwho had expressed similar or greater hesitancy\u201d in imposing the\ndeath penalty. 756 F.\u00a03d, at 678. The Ninth Circuit wrote that\na seated white juror named Ana L. was \u201cindistinguishable from\nOlanders D. in this regard\u201d and that she had \u201cmade almost precisely\nthe same statement in her questionnaire.\u201dIbid.The responses of Olanders D. and Ana L.,\nhowever, were by no means \u201cindistinguishable.\u201d Olanders D.\ninitially voiced unequivocal opposition to the death penalty,\nstating flatly: \u201cI don\u2019t believe in the death penalty.\u201d He also\nrevealed that he had once thought it was \u201ccompletely wrong.\u201d Ana\nL., by contrast, wrote on the questionnaire that she\n\u201cprobablywould not be able to vote for the death penalty,\u201d\nApp. 109 (emphasis added), and she then later said atvoir\u00a0direthat she could vote for a verdict of\ndeath.In a capital case, it is not surprising for\nprospective jurors to express varying degrees of hesitancy about\nvoting for a death verdict. Few are likely to have experienced a\nneed to make a comparable decision at any prior time in their\nlives. As a result, both the prosecution and the defense may be\nrequired to make fine judgment calls about which jurors are more or\nless willing to vote for the ultimate punishment. These judgment\ncalls may involve a comparison of responses that differ in only\nnuanced respects, as well as a sensitive assessment of jurors\u2019\ndemeanor. We have previously recognized that peremptory challenges\n\u201care often the subjects of instinct,\u201dMiller-Elv.Dretke, 545 U.\u00a0S. 231, 252 (2005) (citingBatson, 476 U.\u00a0S., at 106 (Marshall, J., concurring)),\nand that \u201crace-neutral reasons for peremptory challenges often\ninvoke a juror\u2019s demeanor,\u201dSnyder, 552 U.\u00a0S., at 477.\nA trial court is best situated to evaluate both the words and the\ndemeanor of jurors who are peremptorily challenged, as well as the\ncredibility of the prosecutor who exercised those strikes. As we\nhave said, \u201cthese determinations of credibility and demeanor lie\npeculiarly within a trial judge\u2019s province,\u201d and \u201cin the absence of\nexceptional circumstances, we [will] defer to the trial court.\u201dIbid.(alterations and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\u201cAppellate judges cannot on the basis of a cold record easily\nsecond-guess a trial judge\u2019s decision about likely motivation.\u201dCollins, 546 U.\u00a0S., at 343 (Breyer, J.,\nconcurring).The upshot is that even if \u201c[r]easonable minds\nreviewing the record might disagree about the prosecutor\u2019s\ncredibility, .\u00a0.\u00a0. on habeas review that does not suffice\nto supersede the trial court\u2019s credibility determination.\u201dId.,at 341\u2013342 (majority opinion). Here, any similarity\nbetween the responses of Olanders D. and Ana L. is insufficient to\ncompel an inference of racial discrimination underBrechtor\nAEDPA.Ayala contends that the presence of defense\ncounsel might have made a difference because defense counsel might\nhave been able to identify white jurors who were not stricken by\nthe prosecution even though they had \u201cexpressed similar or greater\nhesitancy\u201d about the death penalty. We see no basis for this\nargument. The questionnaires of all the jurors who sat and all the\nalternates are in the record, and Ana L., whom we just discussed,\nis apparently the white juror whose answers come the closest to\nthose of Olanders D. Since neither Ayala nor the Ninth Circuit\nidentified a white juror whose statements better support their\nargument, there is no reason to think that defense counsel could\nhave pointed to a superior comparator at theex\u00a0parteproceeding.3In rejecting the argument that the prosecutor\nperemptorily challenged Olanders D. because of his race, the\nCalifornia Supreme Court appears to have interpreted the\nprosecutor\u2019s explanation of this strike to mean that Olanders D.\u2019s\nviews on the death penalty were alone sufficient to convince him to\nexercise a strike, see 24 Cal. 4th, at 266, 6 P.\u00a03d, at 206,\nand this was certainly an interpretation of the record that must be\nsustained under 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72254(d)(2). As a result, it\nis not necessary for us to consider the prosecutor\u2019s supplementary\nreason for this strike\u2014the poor quality of Olanders D.\u2019s\nresponses\u2014but in any event, the Ninth Circuit\u2019s evaluation of this\nreason is also flawed.The Ninth Circuit wrote that its independent\n\u201creview of the voir\u00a0dire transcript reveal[ed] nothing that\nsupports the prosecution\u2019s claim: Olanders D.\u2019s answers were\nresponsive and complete.\u201d 756 F.\u00a03d, at 679. The record,\nhowever, provides sufficient support for the trial court\u2019s\ndetermination. Olanders D.\u2019s incoherent explanation duringvoir\u00a0direof the reasons for his change of opinion\nabout the death penalty was quoted above. He also provided a\nchronology of the evolution of his views on the subject that did\nnot hold together. He stated that he had been \u201ccompletely against\nthe death sentence\u201d 10 years earlier but seemed to suggest that his\nviews had changed over the course of the intervening decade. See\nApp. 176\u2013177. However, on the questionnaire, which he had completed\njust a month before thevoir\u00a0dire, he wrote\nunequivocally: \u201cI don\u2019t believe in the death penalty.\u201dId.,\nat 179. And then, at the time of thevoir\u00a0dire, he said\nthat he would be willing to impose the death penalty in some cases.Id., at 180. He explained his answer on the questionnaire as\nfollows: \u201cI answered that kind of fast[.] [N]ormally, I wouldn\u2019t\nanswer that question that way, but I mean, I really went through\nthat kind of fast. I should have done better than that.\u201dId.,at 179\u2013180. These answers duringvoir\u00a0direprovide more than sufficient support for the prosecutor\u2019s\nobservation, which the trial court implicitly credited, that\nOlanders D.\u2019s statements \u201cdid not make a lot of sense,\u201d \u201cwere not\nthought out,\u201d and \u201cdemonstrate[d] a lack of ability to express\nhimself well.\u201dIn ordering federal habeas relief based on their\nassessment of the responsiveness and completeness of Olanders D.\u2019s\nanswers, the members of the panel majority misunderstood the role\nof a federal court in a habeas case. The role of a federal habeas\ncourt is to \u201c\u00a0\u2018guard against extreme malfunctions in the state\ncriminal justice systems,\u2019\u00a0\u201dRichter, 562 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 102\u2013103 (quotingJacksonv.Virginia, 443\nU.\u00a0S. 307 , n.\u00a05 (1979) (Stevens, J., concurring in\njudgment)), not to applyde\u00a0novoreview of factual\nfindings and to substitute its own opinions for the determination\nmade on the scene by the trial judge.CAyala next challenges the prosecution\u2019s use of\na peremptory challenge to strike Gerardo O., a Hispanic man. The\nprosecution offered three reasons for this strike: Gerardo O. had a\npoor grasp of English; his answers duringvoir\u00a0direand\non his questionnaire suggested that he might not be willing to\nimpose the death penalty; and he did not appear to get along with\nthe other prospective jurors. The trial judge accepted this\nexplanation, as did the State Supreme Court.The Ninth Circuit, however, rejected the state\ncourts\u2019 determinations based on speculation that defense counsel,\nif present at thein camerahearing, \u201clikely could have\ncalled into question all of the prosecution\u2019s stated reasons for\nstriking Gerardo O.\u201d 756 F.\u00a03d, at 680. The Ninth Circuit\nthought that it could grant Ayala relief simply because it \u201c[could\nnot] say that Ayala would not have shown that the trial court would\nor should have determined that the prosecution\u2019s strike of Gerardo\nO. violatedBatson.\u201dId.,at 682. But that is not the\ntest. The inquiry underBrechtis not whether the federal\nhabeas court could definitively say that there were no winning\narguments that the defense could have made. Instead, the evidence\nin the record must raise \u201cgrave doubt[s]\u201d about whether the trial\njudge would have ruled differently.O\u2019Neal, 513 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 436. This requires much more than a \u201creasonable possibility\u201d\nthat the result of the hearing would have been different.Brecht, 507 U.\u00a0S., at 637 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). And on the record in this case, Ayala cannot establish\nactual prejudice or that no fairminded jurist could agree with the\nstate court\u2019s application ofChapman.We begin with the prosecution\u2019s explanation that\nit challenged Gerardo O. because of his limited English\nproficiency. Duringvoir\u00a0dire, Gerardo O. acknowledged\nthat someone else had written the answers for him onhis\nquestionnaire \u201c[b]ecause I couldn\u2019t\u2014I cannot read\u2014I cannot spell\nthat well.\u201d App. 163. He added that he \u201cdidn\u2019t get\u201d some of the\nwords on the questionnaire.Ibid.Gerardo O.\u2019s testimony\nalso revealed that he might well have been unable to follow what\nwas said at trial. When asked whether he could understand spoken\nEnglish, he responded: \u201cIt depends if you make long words. If you\nmake\u2014if you go\u2014if you say it straight out, then I might understand.\nIf you beat around the bush, I won\u2019t.\u201dId.,at 166. At that\npoint, defense counsel and Gerardo O. engaged in a colloquy that\nsuggests that defense counsel recognized that he lacked the ability\nto understand words not used in basic everyday speech, \u201clegal\nwords,\u201d and rapid speech in English:\u201cQ: I\u2019ll try not to talk\u2014use any legal words or\nlawyer talk\u2014\u201cA: Okay.\u201cQ: \u2014and talk regular with you. If you don\u2019t\nunderstand anything I say, stop me and tell me, okay?\u201cA: Okay.\u201cQ: If you\u2019re selected as a juror during the\ntrial, and you know you\u2019re serving as a juror and listening to\nwitnesses, can we have your promise that if a witness uses a word\nyou don\u2019t understand, you\u2019ll put your hand up and let us know?\u201cA: Yeah..\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003.\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003.\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003.\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003.\u201cQ: There\u2019s one more problem that you\u2019re\ngoing to have with me, and that is that sometimes .\u00a0.\u00a0. I\ntalk real fast .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201dId.,at 166\u2013167.It is understandable for a prosecutor to strike\na potential juror who might have difficulty understanding\nEnglish.[3] The jurors who were\nultimately selected heard many days of testimony, and the\ninstructions at both the guilt and the penalty phases included\n\u201clegal words\u201d and words not common in everyday speech. The\nprosecution had an obvious reason to worry that service on this\njury would have strained Gerardo O.\u2019s linguistic capability.The Ninth Circuit reached a contrary conclusion\nby distorting the record and the applicable law. The Ninth Circuit\nfirst suggested that Gerardo O.\u2019s English-language deficiencies\nwere limited to reading and writing, 756 F.\u00a03d, at 680, but as\nthe portions of thevoir\u00a0direquoted above make clear,\nthat was not true; the record shows that his ability to understand\nspoken English was also limited. The Ninth Circuit then suggested\nthat \u201c[t]he prosecution\u2019s purported reason for striking Gerardo O.\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. was directly related to his status as someone who\nspoke Spanish as his first language,\u201dibid., but the\nprosecutor voiced no concern about Gerardo O.\u2019s ability to speak\nSpanish or about the fact that Spanish was his first language. The\nprosecution\u2019s objection concerned Gerardo O.\u2019s limited proficiency\ninEnglish. The Ninth Circuit quoted the following statement\nfromHernandezv.New York, 500 U.\u00a0S. 352, 363\n(1991) (plurality opinion): \u201c\u00a0\u2018[T]he prosecutor\u2019s frank\nadmission that his ground for excusing th[is] juror[\u00a0] related\nto [his] ability to speak and understand Spanish raised a\nplausible, though not a necessary, inference that language might be\na pretext for what in fact [was a] race-based peremptory\nchallenge[\u00a0].\u2019\u00a0\u201d 756 F.\u00a03d, at 680 (alterations in\noriginal). This statement, however, did not concern a peremptory\nexercised due to a prospective juror\u2019s lack of English proficiency.\nInstead, it concerned the dismissal ofSpanish-speaking members of the venire for fear\nthat, if seated, they might not follow the English translation of\ntestimony given in Spanish. See 500 U.\u00a0S., at 360. The Ninth\nCircuit\u2019s decision regarding Gerardo O. was thus based on a\nmisreading of the record and a distortion of our case law. And\nneither Ayala nor the Ninth Circuit has identified anything that\ndefense counsel might have done at theex\u00a0partehearing\nto show that the prosecutor\u2019s concern about Gerardo O.\u2019s limited\nEnglish proficiency was pretextual.The prosecution\u2019s second proffered reason for\nstriking Gerardo O. was concern about his willingness to impose the\ndeath penalty, and as the trial court found, this observation was\nalso supported by the record. Indeed, when asked invoir\u00a0direhow he felt about imposing the death penalty,\nGerardo O. responded that he was \u201c[k]ind of shaky about\nit.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0I\u2019m not too sure if I can take\nsomeone else\u2019s life in my hands and say that; say, you know,\n\u2018death,\u2019 or something.\u201d App. 168. In response to another question\nabout his thoughts on the death penalty, he replied: \u201cI don\u2019t know\nyet. It\u2019s kind of hard, you know, to pick it up like that and say\nhow I feel about the death penalty.\u201d 15 Tr. 1052. Answering a\nquestion about whether his thoughts on the death penalty would\naffect how he viewed the evidence presented at trial, he responded,\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, sir, to tell you the truth.\u201d App. 165. And when\nasked if he had \u201cany feeling that [he] would be unable to vote for\nthe death penalty if [he] thought it was a case that called for\nit,\u201d Gerardo O. responded once again, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d 15 Tr. 1043.\nWhile Gerardo O. did say at one point that he might be willing to\nimpose the death pen-alty, he qualified that statement by adding\nthat he would be comforted by the fact that \u201cthere\u2019s eleven more\nother persons on the jury.\u201d App. 170.What we said above regarding jurors who express\ndoubts about their openness to a death verdict applies as well\nhere. The prosecution\u2019s reluctance to take a chance that Gerardo O.\nwould ultimately be willing to consider the death penalty in\naccordance with state law did not compel the trial judge to find\nthat the strike of Gerardo O. was based on race.Nor is there a basis for finding that the\nabsence of defense counsel affected the trial judge\u2019s evaluation of\nthe sincerity of this proffered ground for the strike. Defense\ncounsel had a full opportunity duringvoir\u00a0direto\ncreate a record regarding Gerardo O.\u2019s openness to the death\npenalty. And defense counsel had the opportunity prior to theex\u00a0parteproceeding on the Gerardo O. strike to compare\nthe minority jurors dismissed by the prosecution with white jurors\nwho were seated. Counsel argued that the answers on the death\npenalty given by the minority jurors were \u201cnot significantly\ndifferent from [those of] the white jurors that the prosecution\nha[d] chosen to leave on the jury.\u201dId.,at 306. The trial\njudge asked counsel for \u201cparticulars,\u201d and counsel discussed\nGerardo O., albeit briefly.Id.,at 307\u2013308. Thus, there is\nno reason to believe that counsel could have made a more persuasive\nargumentat theex\u00a0parteproceeding than he made during\nthisexchange.The prosecution\u2019s final reason for striking\nGerardo O. was that he appeared to be \u201ca standoffish type of\nindivid-ual\u201d whose \u201cdress\nand\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0mannerisms\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0were\nnot in keeping with the other jurors\u201d and who \u201cdid not appear to be\nsocializing or mixing with any of the other jurors.\u201dId., at\n298. The trial judge did not dispute that the prosecution\u2019s\nreflections were borne out by the record. The California Supreme\nCourt affirmed and also emphasized that \u201cthe trial court\u2019s rulings\nin the ex\u00a0parte hearing indisput-ably reflect both its\nfamiliarity with the record of voir\u00a0dire of the challenged\nprospective jurors and its critical assessment of the prosecutor\u2019s\nproffered justifications.\u201d 24 Cal.\u00a04th, at 266\u2013267, 6\nP.\u00a03d, at 206.In light of the strength of the prosecution\u2019s\nfirst two reasons for striking Gerardo O., it is not at all clear\nthat the prosecution proffered this final reason as an essential\nfactor in its decision to strike, but in any event, there is no\nsupport for the suggestion that Ayala\u2019s attorney, if allowed to\nattend theex partehearing, would have been able to\nconvince the judge that this reason was pretextual. The Ninth\nCircuit, however, was content to speculate about what might have\nbeen. Mixing guesswork with armchair sociology, the Ninth Circuit\nmused that \u201c[i]t is likely that Gerardo O.\u2019s dress and mannerisms\nwere distinctly Hispanic. Perhaps in the late 1980\u2019s Hispanic males\nin San Diego County were more likely than members of other racial\nor ethnic groups in the area to wear a particular style or color of\nshirt, and Gerardo O. was wearing such a shirt.\u201d 756 F.\u00a03d, at\n680\u2013681. As for the prosecution\u2019s observation that Gerardo O. did\nnot socialize with other jurors, the Ninth Circuit posited that,\n\u201cperhaps, unbeknownst to the trial judge, Gerardo O. did\n\u2018socializ[e] or mix[\u00a0]\u2019 with a number of other jurors, and had\neven organized a dinner for some of them at his favorite Mexican\nrestaurant.\u201dId.,at 681.This is not how habeas review is supposed to\nwork. The record provides no basis for the Ninth Circuit\u2019s flight\nof fancy.Brechtrequires more than speculation about what\nextrarecord information defense counsel might have mentioned. And\nspeculation of that type is not enough to show that a State Supreme\nCourt\u2019s rejection of the argument regarding Gerardo O. was\nunreasonable.DThe final prospective juror specifically\ndiscussed in the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision was Robert M., who is\nHispanic. The prosecution\u2019s primary proffered reason for striking\nRobert M. was concern that he would not impose the death penalty,\nthough the prosecution added that it was troubled that he had\nfollowed the Sagon Penn case, a high-profile prosecution in San\nDiego in which an alleged murderer was acquitted amid allegations\nof misconduct by police and prosecutors. In addition, the\nprosecution also explained to the trial court that Robert M. scored\npoorly on its 10-point scale for evaluating prospective jurors. The\ntrial court accepted the prosecutor\u2019s explanation of the\nstrike.With respect to the prosecution\u2019s concern that\nRobert M. might not be willing to impose the death penalty, the\nNinth Circuit found that defense counsel, if permitted to attend\nthein cameraproceeding, could have compared Robert M.\u2019s\nstatements about the death penalty to those of other jurors and\ncould have reminded the judge that Robert M. had \u201crepeatedly stated\nduring voir\u00a0dire that he believed in the death penalty and\ncould personally vote to impose it.\u201d 756 F.\u00a03d, at 682. But as\nwith Olanders D. and Gerardo O., we cannot say that the prosecution\nhad no basis for doubting Robert M.\u2019s willingness to impose the\ndeath penalty. For example, when asked at one point whether he\ncould vote for death, Robert M. responded: \u201cWell, I\u2019ve though[t]\nabout that, but it\u2019s a difficult question, and yeah, it is\ndifficult for me to say, you know, one way or the other. I believe\nin it, but for me to be involved in it is\u2014is hard. It\u2019s hard to\naccept that aspect of it, do you know what I mean?\u201d App. 149\u2013150.\nIn response to another question, he said: \u201cIt would be hard, but I\nthink I could, yes. It\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s hard to say, you know\u2014and I don\u2019t\ncare who the person is\u2014to say that they have to put somebody away,\nyou know. It\u2019s very hard.\u201dId.,at 154. These are hardly\nanswers that would inspire confidence in the minds of prosecutors\nin a capital case.While the Ninth Circuit argued that defense\ncounsel\u2019s absence at thein camerahearing prejudiced the\ntrial judge\u2019s ability to assess this reason for the strike of\nRobert M., the Ninth Circuit failed to mention that defense counsel\nspecifically addressed this issue duringvoir\u00a0dire. At\nthat time, he pointedly reminded the judge that Robert M. had made\nseveral statements duringvoir\u00a0direthat were favorable\nto the death penalty.Id., at 307. The trial judge thus\nheard defense counsel\u2019s arguments but nevertheless concluded that\nthe record supplied a basis for a legitimate concern about whether\nRobert M. could impose the death penalty. That Ayala\u2019s attorney did\nnot have the opportunity to repeat this same argument once more at\nthein cameraproceeding does not create grave doubt about\nwhether the trial court would have decided the issue\ndifferently.As for the prosecution\u2019s second proffered reason\nfor striking Robert M.\u2014that he had followed the Sagon Penn\ncase[4]\u2014the Ninth Circuit\nplaced great emphasis on the fact that a seated white juror had\nfollowed a different murder trial, that of Robert Alton\nHarris.[5] But the Penn and\nHarris cases were quite different. Harris was convicted while Penn\nwas acquitted; and since the Harris case was much older, the\nexperience of following it was less likely to have an effect at the\ntime of the trial in this case.EAyala raised aBatsonobjection about\nthe prosecution\u2019s use of peremptory challenges on four additional\njurors, George S., Barbara S., Galileo S., and Luis M. The Ninth\nCircuit did not address these prospective jurors at length, and we\nneed not dwell long on them. With respect to all four of these\nprospective jurors, we conclude that any constitutional error was\nharmless.Of these four additional jurors, Ayala\u2019s brief\nin this Court develops an argument with respect to only two,George S. and Barbara S. And while Ayala\u2019s\nattorney claimed that George S. was Hispanic, the prosecutor said\nthat he thought that George S. was Greek. In any event, the\nprosecution offered several reasons for striking George S. The\nprosecutor noted that one of his responses \u201cwas essentially, \u2018you\nprobably don\u2019t want me to be a juror on this case.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId., at 312. The prosecutor was also concerned about whether\nhe would vote for death or even a life sentence and whether he\nwould follow the law as opposed to his personal religious beliefs.\nIn addition, the prosecutor noted that George S. had previously\nbeen the sole holdout on a jury and that his prior application to\nbe a police officer had been rejected, for reasons that were not\nclear. The trial court accepted these explanations.Ayala contests only two of these justifications.\nHe quibbles that George S. had not been a \u201c\u00a0\u2018holdout,\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nbut instead had been the dissenting juror in a civil case on which\nunanimity was not required. This observation does not render the\nprosecution\u2019s proffered justification \u201cfalse or pretextual.\u201d Brief\nfor Respondent 46. The fact that George S. had been willing to\ndissent from a jury verdict could reasonably give a prosecutor\npause in a capital case since a single holdout juror could prevent\na guilty verdict or death sentence. The most that Ayala can\nestablish is that reasonable minds can disagree about whether the\nprosecution\u2019s fears were well founded, but this does not come close\nto establishing \u201cactual prejudice\u201d underBrecht. Nor does it\nmeet the AEDPA standard. Ayala also points out that a seated white\njuror, Charles C., had been re-jected by a police force, but George\nS. admitted that he had applied to law enforcement because he was\n\u201ctrying to get out of the Army,\u201d App. 222, and the reasons for his\nrejection were not clear. Charles C., by contrast, had received a\nqualifying score on a law enforcement exam but was not hired\nbecause a position was not available.As for Barbara S., the prosecution struck her\nbecause, duringvoir\u00a0dire, she appeared to be \u201cunder\nthe influence of drugs\u201d and disconnected from the proceedings.Id., at 314. The prosecution emphasized that she had \u201can\nempty look in her eyes, slow responses, a lack of really being\ntotally in tune with what was going on.\u201dIbid.It added that\nshe appeared \u201csomewhat angry,\u201d \u201cmanifest[ed] a great deal of\nnervousness,\u201d and seemed like someone who would be unlikely to\nclosely follow the trial.Ibid.The trial judge thought that\nBarbara S. appeared nervous rather than hostile, but he agreed that\nshe gave incomplete answers that were sometimes \u201cnon sequiturs.\u201dId.,at 315. He concluded, \u201cI certainly cannot quarrel\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. with your subjective impression, and the use of\nyour peremp-tory challenge based upon her individual manifestation,\nas opposed to her ethnicity.\u201dIbid.Ayala points to the\ntrial court\u2019s disagreement with the prosecutor\u2019s impression that\nBarbara S. was hostile, but this ruling illustrates the trial\njudge\u2019s recollection of the demeanor of the prospective jurors and\nhis careful evaluation of each of the prosecutor\u2019s proffered\nreasons for strikes. And the fact that the trial judge\u2019s impression\nof Barbara S.\u2019s demeanor was somewhat different from the\nprosecutor\u2019s hardly shows that the prosecutor\u2019s reasons were\npretextual. It is not at all unusual for individuals to come to\ndifferent conclusions in attempting to read another person\u2019s\nattitude or mood.IVThe pattern of peremptory challenges in this\ncase was sufficient to raise suspicions about the prosecution\u2019s\nmotives and to call for the prosecution to explain its strikes. As\nwe have held, the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits a prosecutor from\nstriking potential jurors based on race. Discrimination in the jury\nselection process undermines our criminal justice system and\npoisons public confidence in the evenhanded administration of\njustice.InBatson, this Court adopted a procedure\nfor ferreting out discrimination in the exercise of peremptory\nchallenges, and this procedure places great responsibility in\nthehands of the trial judge, who is in the best position to\ndetermine whether a peremptory challenge is based on an\nimpermissible factor. This is a difficult determination because of\nthe nature of peremptory challenges: They are often based on subtle\nimpressions and intangible factors. In this case, the conscientious\ntrial judge determined that the strikes at issue were not based on\nrace, and his judgment was entitled to great weight. On appeal,\nfive justices of the California Supreme Court carefully evaluated\nthe record and found no basis to reverse. A Federal District Judge\ndenied federal habeas relief, but a divided panel of the Ninth\nCircuit reversed the District Court and found that the California\nSupreme Court had rendered a decision with which no fairminded\njurist could agree.For the reasons explained above, it was the\nNinth Circuit that erred. The exclusion of Ayala\u2019s attorney from\npart of theBatsonhearing was harmless error. There is no\nbasis for finding that Ayala suffered actual prejudice, and the\ndecision of the California Supreme Court represented an entirely\nreasonable application of controlling precedent.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the\nNinth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.Notes1The panel decided this\nquestionde novobecause it concluded that the California\nSupreme Court either did not decide whether theex parteproceedings violated the Federal Constitution or silently decided\nthat question in Ayala\u2019s favor. 756 F.\u00a03d, at\n666\u2013670.2In a footnote, however,\nthe panel stated: \u201cIn holding that Ayala has demonstrated his\nentitlement to relief underBrecht, we therefore also hold\nto be an unreasonable application ofChapmanthe California\nSupreme Court\u2019s conclusion that Ayala was not prejudiced by the\nexclusion of the defense.\u201dId.,at 674,\nn.\u00a013.3The California Supreme\nCourt has held that \u201c[i]nsufficient command of the English language\nto allow full understanding of the words employed in instructions\nand full participation in deliberations clearly .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nrender[s] a juror \u2018unable to perform his duty\u2019\u00a0\u201d within the\nmeaning of the California Penal Code.Peoplev.Lomax, 49 Cal. 4th 530, 566, 234 P.\u00a03d 377, 407 (2010)\n(citation omitted).
