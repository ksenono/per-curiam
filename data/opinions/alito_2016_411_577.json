So when a friend offered her a stun gun \u201cfor\nself-defense against [her] former boy friend,\u201d 470 Mass. 774, 776,\n26 N.\u00a0E.\u00a03d 688, 690 (2015), Caetano accepted the\nweapon.It is a good thing she did. One night after\nleaving work, Caetano found her ex-boyfriend \u201cwaiting for [her]\noutside.\u201d Tr. 35. He \u201cstarted screaming\u201d that she was \u201cnot gonna\n[expletive deleted] work at this place\u201d any more because she\n\u201cshould be home with the kids\u201d they had together.Ibid.Caetano\u2019s abuser towered over her by nearly a foot and outweighed\nher by close to 100 pounds. But she didn\u2019t need physical strength\nto protect herself. She stood her ground, displayed the stun gun,\nand announced: \u201cI\u2019m not gonna take this\nanymore.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. I don\u2019t wanna have to [use the stun\ngun on] you, but if you don\u2019t leave me alone, I\u2019m gonna have to.\u201dId.,at 35\u201336. The gambit worked. The ex-boyfriend \u201cgot\nscared and he left [her] alone.\u201dId.,at 36.It is settled that the Second Amendment protects\nan individual right to keep and bear arms that applies against both\nthe Federal Government and the States.District of Columbiav.Heller, 554 U.\u00a0S. 570 (2008) ;McDonaldv.Chicago, 561 U.\u00a0S. 742 (2010) . That right vindicates\nthe \u201cbasic right\u201d of \u201cindividual self-defense.\u201dId., at 767;\nseeHeller,supra, at 599, 628. Caetano\u2019s encounter\nwith her violent ex-boyfriend illustrates the connection between\nthose fundamental rights: By arming herself, Caetano was able to\nprotect against a physical threat that restraining orders had\nproved useless to prevent. And, commendably, she did so by using a\nweapon that posed little, if any, danger of permanently harming\neither herself or the father of her children.Under Massachusetts law, however, Caetano\u2019s mere\npossession of the stun gun that may have saved her life made her a\ncriminal. See Mass. Gen. Laws, ch.\u00a0140, \u00a7131J (2014). When\npolice later discovered the weapon, she was arrested, tried, and\nconvicted. The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court affirmed the\nconviction, holding that a stun gun \u201cis not the type of weapon that\nis eligible for Second Amendment protection\u201d because it was \u201cnot in\ncommon use at the time of [the Second Amendment\u2019s] enactment.\u201d 470\nMass., at 781, 26 N.\u00a0E.\u00a03d, at 693.This reasoning defies our decision inHeller, which rejected as \u201cbordering on the frivolous\u201d the\nargument \u201cthat only those arms in existence in the 18th century are\nprotected by the Second Amendment.\u201d 554 U.\u00a0S., at 582. The\ndecision below also does a grave disservice to vulnerable\nindividuals like Caetano who must defend themselves because the\nState will not.IThe events leading to Caetano\u2019s prosecution\noccurred sometime after the confrontation between her and her\nex-boyfriend. In September 2011, police officers responded to a\nreported shoplifting at an Ashland, Massachusetts, supermarket. The\nstore\u2019s manager had detained a suspect, but he identified Caetano\nand another person in the parking lot as potential accomplices.\nPolice approached the two and obtained Caetano\u2019s consent to search\nher purse. They found no evidence of shoplifting, but saw Caetano\u2019s\nstun gun. Caetano explained to the officers that she had acquired\nthe weapon to defend herself against a violent ex-boyfriend.The officers believed Caetano, but they arrested\nher for violating Mass. Gen. Laws, ch.\u00a0140, \u00a7131J, \u201cwhich bans\nentirely the possession of an electrical weapon,\u201d 470 Mass., at\n775, 26 N.\u00a0E.\u00a03d, at 689.[1] When Caetano moved to dismiss the charge on Second\nAmendment grounds, the trial court denied the motion.A subsequent bench trial established the\nfollowing undisputed facts. The parties stipulated that Caetano\npossessed the stun gun and that the weapon fell within the\nstatute\u2019s prohibition.[2] The\nCommonwealth also did not challenge Caetano\u2019s testimony that she\npossessed the weapon to defend herself against the violent\nex-boyfriend. Indeed, the prosecutor urged the court \u201cto believe\nthe defendant.\u201d Tr. 40. The trial court nonetheless found Caetano\nguilty, and she appealed to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial\nCourt.The Supreme Judicial Court rejected Caetano\u2019s\nSecond Amendment claim, holding that \u201ca stun gun is not the type of\nweapon that is eligible for Second Amendment protection.\u201d 470\nMass., at 775, 26 N.\u00a0E.\u00a03d, at 689. The court reasoned\nthat stun guns are unprotected because they were \u201cnot \u2018in common\nuse at the time\u2019 of enactment of the Second Amendment,\u201did.,at 781, 26 N.\u00a0E.\u00a03d, at 693 (quotingHeller,supra, at 627), and because they fall within the\n\u201ctraditional prohibition against carrying dangerous and unusual\nweapons,\u201d 470 Mass.,at 779, 26 N.\u00a0E.\u00a03d, at 692\n(citingHeller,supra, at 627).IIAlthough the Supreme Judicial Court professed\nto applyHeller, each step of its analysis defiedHeller\u2019s reasoning.AThe state court repeatedly framed the question\nbefore it as whether a particular weapon was \u201c\u00a0\u2018in common use\nat the time\u2019 of enactment of the Second Amendment.\u201d 470 Mass., at\n781, 26 N.\u00a0E.\u00a03d, at 693; see alsoid.,at 779,\n780, 781, 26 N.\u00a0E.\u00a03d, at 692, 693, 694. InHeller, we emphatically rejected such a formulation. We\nfound the argument \u201cthat only those arms in existence in the 18th\ncentury are protected by the Second Amendment\u201d not merely wrong,\nbut \u201cbordering on the frivolous.\u201d 554 U.\u00a0S., at 582. Instead,\nwe held that \u201cthe Second Amendment extends, prima facie, to all\ninstruments that constitute bearable arms,even those that were\nnot in existence at the time of the founding.\u201dIbid.(emphasis added).[3] It is hard\nto imagine language speaking more directly to the point. Yet the\nSupreme Judicial Court did not so much as mention it.Instead, the court seized on language,\noriginating inUnited Statesv.Miller, 307\nU.\u00a0S. 174 (1939) , that \u201c\u00a0\u2018the sorts of weapons protected\nwere those \u201cin common use at the time.\u201d\u00a0\u2019\u00a0\u201d 470 Mass., at\n778, 26 N.\u00a0E.\u00a03d, at 692 (quotingHeller,supra, at 627, in turn quotingMiller,supra,\nat 179). That quotation does not mean, as the court below thought,\nthat only weapons popular in 1789 are covered by the Second\nAmendment. It simply reflects the reality that the founding-era\nmilitia consisted of citizens \u201cwho would bring the sorts of lawful\nweapons that they possessed at home to militia duty,\u201dHeller, 554 U.\u00a0S., at 627, and that the Second\nAmendment accordingly guarantees the right to carry weapons\n\u201ctypically possessed by law-abiding citizens for lawful purposes,\u201did.,at 625. While stun guns were not in existence at the\nend of the 18th century, the same is true for the weapons most\ncommonly used today for self-defense, namely, revolvers and\nsemiautomatic pistols. Revolvers were virtually unknown until well\ninto the 19th century,[4] and\nsemiautomatic pistols were not invented until near the end of that\ncentury.[5] Electronic stun\nguns are no more exempt from the Second Amendment\u2019s protections,\nsimply because they were unknown to the First Congress, than\nelectronic communications are exempt from the First Amendment, or\nelectronic imaging devices are exempt from the Fourth Amendment.Id.,at 582 (citingRenov.American Civil\nLiberties Union, 521 U.\u00a0S. 844, 849 (1997) , andKyllov.United States, 533 U.\u00a0S. 27 \u201336\n(2001)). AsHelleraptly put it: \u201cWe do not interpret\nconstitutional rights that way.\u201d 554 U.\u00a0S., at 582.BThe Supreme Judicial Court\u2019s holding that stun\nguns may be banned as \u201cdangerous and unusual weapons\u201d fares no\nbetter. As theper curiamopinion recognizes, this is a\nconjunctive test: A weapon may not be banned unless it isbothdangerousandunusual. Because the Court rejects\nthe lower court\u2019s conclusion that stun guns are \u201cunusual,\u201d it does\nnot need to consider the lower court\u2019s conclusion that they are\nalso \u201cdangerous.\u201d Seeante, at 1\u20132. But make no mistake\u2014the\ndecision below gravely erred on both grounds.1As to \u201cdangerous,\u201d the court below held that a\nweapon is \u201cdangerous per\u00a0se\u201d if it is \u201c\u00a0\u2018designed and\nconstructed to produce death or great bodily harm\u2019 and \u2018for the\npurpose of bodily assault or defense.\u2019\u00a0\u201d 470 Mass., at 779, 26\nN.\u00a0E.\u00a03d, at 692 (quotingCommonwealthv.Appleby, 380 Mass. 296, 303, 402 N.\u00a0E.\u00a02d 1051,\n1056 (1980)). That test may be appropriate for applying statutes\ncriminalizing assault with a dangerous weapon. Seeibid.,\n402 N.\u00a0E.\u00a02d, at 1056. But it cannot be used to identify\narms that fall outside the Second Amendment. First, the relative\ndangerousness of a weapon is irrelevant when the weapon belongs to\na class of arms commonly used for lawful purposes. SeeHeller,supra, at 627 (contrasting \u201c\u00a0\u2018dangerous\nand unusual weapons\u2019\u00a0\u201d that may be banned with protected\n\u201cweapons .\u00a0.\u00a0. \u2018in common use at the time\u2019\u00a0\u201d).\nSecond, even in cases where dangerousness might be relevant, the\nSupreme Judicial Court\u2019s test sweeps far too broadly.Hellerdefined the \u201cArms\u201dcovered bythe Second Amendment to\ninclude \u201c\u00a0\u2018any thing that a man wears for his defence, or\ntakes into his hands, or useth in wrath to cast at or strike\nanother.\u2019\u00a0\u201d 554 U.\u00a0S., at 581. Under the decision below,\nhowever, virtually every covered arm would qualify as\n\u201cdangerous.\u201dWere there any doubt on this point, one need\nonly look at the court\u2019s first example of \u201cdangerous per se\u201d\nweapons: \u201cfirearms.\u201d 470 Mass., at 779, 26 N.\u00a0E.\u00a03d, at\n692. IfHellertells us anything, it is that firearms cannot\nbe categorically prohibited just because they are dangerous. 554\nU.\u00a0S., at 636.A\u00a0fortiori, stun guns that the\nCommonwealth\u2019s own witness described as \u201cnon-lethal force,\u201d Tr. 27,\ncannot be banned on that basis.2The Supreme Judicial Court\u2019s conclusion that\nstun guns are \u201cunusual\u201d rested largely on its premise that one must\nask whether a weapon was commonly used in 1789. See 470 Mass., at\n780\u2013781, 26 N.\u00a0E.\u00a03d, at 693\u2013694. As already discussed,\nthat is simply wrong. Seesupra,at 4\u20136.The court also opined that a weapon\u2019s\nunusualness depends on whether \u201cit is a weapon of warfare to be\nused by the militia.\u201d 470 Mass., at 780, 26 N.\u00a0E.\u00a03d, at\n693. It asserted that we followed such an approach inMillerand \u201capproved its use inHeller.\u201d 470 Mass., at 780, 26\nN.\u00a0E.\u00a03d, at 693. ButHelleractually said that it\nwould be a \u201cstartling reading\u201d ofMillerto conclude that\n\u201conly those weapons useful in warfare are protected.\u201d 554\nU.\u00a0S., at 624. Instead,MillerandHellerrecognized that militia members traditionally reported for duty\ncarrying \u201cthe sorts of lawful weapons that they possessed at home,\u201d\nand that the Second Amendment therefore protects such weapons as a\nclass, regardless of any particular weapon\u2019s suitability for\nmilitary use. 554 U.\u00a0S.,at 627; seeid.,at\n624\u2013625. Indeed,Helleracknowledged that advancements in\nmilitary technology might render many commonly owned weapons\nineffective in warfare.Id.,at 627\u2013628. But such \u201cmodern\ndevelopments .\u00a0.\u00a0. cannot change our interpretation of\nthe right.\u201dIbid.In any event, the Supreme Judicial Court\u2019s\nassumption that stun guns are unsuited for militia or military use\nis untenable. Section 131J allows law enforcement and correctional\nofficers to carry stun guns and Tasers, presumably for such\npurposes as nonlethal crowd control. Subduing members of a mob is\nlittle different from \u201csuppress[ing] Insurrections,\u201d a traditional\nrole of the militia. U.\u00a0S. Const., Art.\u00a0I, \u00a78,\ncl.\u00a015; see alsoibid.(militia may be called forth \u201cto\nexecute the Laws of the Union\u201d). Additionally, several branches of\nthe U.\u00a0S. armed services equip troops with electrical stun\nweapons to \u201cincapacitate a target without permanent injury or known\nside effects.\u201d U.\u00a0S. Army, Project Manager Close Combat\nSystems, PD Combat Munitions: Launched Electrode Stun Device\n(LESD),\nhttp://www.pica.army.mil/pmccs/combatmunitions/nonlethalsys/taserx26e.html\n(all Internet materials as last visited Mar. 18, 2016); see\nU.\u00a0S. Marine Corps Admin-istrative Message 560/08 (Oct. 2,\n2008) (Marine Corps guidance for use of Tasers),\nhttp://www.marines.mil/News\u00a0/\u00a0Messages\u00a0/\u00a0MessagesDisplay\u00a0/tabid/13286/Article/113024/marine-corps-training-and-use-of-human-electro-muscular-incapacitation-hemi-dev.aspx;\nJoint Non-Lethal Weapons Directorate, Non-Lethal Weapons (NLW)\nReference Book 3 (2012) (Department of Defense report stating that\n\u201c[m]ultiple Services employ\u201d Tasers),\nhttp://dtic.mil/dtic/\u200ctr/fulltext/u2/a565971.pdf.CAs the foregoing makes clear, the pertinent\nSecond Amendment inquiry is whether stun guns are commonly\npossessed by law-abiding citizens for lawful purposestoday.\nThe Supreme Judicial Court offered only a cursory discussion of\nthat question, noting that the \u201c\u00a0\u2018number of Tasers and stun\nguns is dwarfed by the number of firearms.\u2019\u00a0\u201d 470 Mass., at\n781, 26 N.\u00a0E. 3d, at 693. This observation may be true, but it\nis beside the point. Otherwise, a State would be free to banallweaponsexcepthandguns, because \u201chandguns are\nthe most popular weapon chosen by Americans for self-defense in the\nhome.\u201dHeller,supra, at 629.The more relevant statistic is that \u201c[h]undreds\nof thousands of Tasers and stun guns have been sold to private\ncitizens,\u201d who it appears may lawfully possess them in 45 States.Peoplev.Yanna, 297 Mich. App. 137, 144, 824\nN.\u00a0W.\u00a02d 241, 245 (2012) (holding Michigan stun gun ban\nunconstitutional); see Volokh, Nonlethal Self-Defense, (Almost\nEntirely) Nonlethal Weapons, and the Rights To Keep and Bear Arms\nand Defend Life, 62 Stan. L.\u00a0Rev. 199, 244 (2009) (citing stun\ngun bans in seven States); Wis. Stat. \u00a7941.295 (Supp. 2015)\n(amended Wisconsin law permitting stun gun possession); see also\nBrief in Opposition 11 (acknowledging that \u201capproximately 200,000\ncivilians owned stun guns\u201d as of 2009). While less popular than\nhandguns, stun guns are widely owned and accepted as a legitimate\nmeans of self-defense across the country. Massachusetts\u2019\ncategorical ban of such weapons therefore violates the Second\nAmendment.IIIThe lower court\u2019s ill treatment ofHellercannot stand. The reasoning of the Massachusetts\ncourt poses a grave threat to the fundamental right of\nself-defense. The Supreme Judicial Court suggested that Caetano\ncould have simply gotten a firearm to defend herself. 470 Mass., at\n783, 26 N.\u00a0E.\u00a03d, at 695. But the right to bear other\nweapons is \u201cno answer\u201d to a ban on the possession of protected\narms.Heller, 554 U.\u00a0S., at 629. Moreover, a weapon is\nan effective means of self-defense only if one is prepared to use\nit, and it is presumptuous to tell Caetano she should have been\nready to shoot the father of her two young children if she wanted\nto protect herself. Courts should not be in the business of\ndemanding that citizens usemoreforce for self-defense than\nthey are comfortable wielding.[6]Countless people may have reservations about\nusing deadly force, whether for moral, religious, or emotional\nreasons\u2014or simply out of fear of killing the wrong person. See\nBrief for Arming Women Against Rape & Endangerment asAmicus\nCuriae4\u20135. \u201cSelf-defense,\u201d however, \u201cis a basic right.\u201dMcDonald, 561 U.\u00a0S.,at 767. I am not prepared\nto say that a State may force an individual to choose between\nexercising that right and following her conscience, at least where\nboth can be accommodated by a weapon already in widespread use\nacross the Nation.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*A State\u2019s most basic responsibility is to keep\nits people safe. The Commonwealth of Massachusetts was either\nunable or unwilling to do what was necessary to protect Jaime\nCaetano, so she was forced to protect herself. To make matters\nworse, the Commonwealth chose to deploy its prosecutorial resources\nto prosecute and convict her of a criminal offense for arming\nherself with a nonlethal weapon that may well have saved her life.\nThe Supreme Judicial Court then affirmed her conviction on the\nflimsiest of grounds. This Court\u2019s grudgingper curiamnow\nsends the case back to that same court. And the consequences for\nCaetano may prove more tragic still, as her conviction likely bars\nher from ever bearing arms for self-defense. See Pet. for Cert.\n14.If the fundamental right of self-defense does\nnot protect Caetano, then the safety of all Americans is left to\nthe mercy of state authorities who may be more concerned about\ndisarming the people than about keeping them safe.Notes1Specifically, the statute\nprohibits the possession of any \u201cportable device or weapon from\nwhich an electrical current, impulse, wave or beam may be directed,\nwhich current, impulse, wave or beam is designed to incapacitate\ntemporarily, injure or kill.\u201d Mass. Gen. Laws, ch.\u00a0140, \u00a7131J\n(2014). The statute includes exceptions for law-enforcement\nofficers and weapon suppliers, who may possess electrical weapons\n\u201cdesigned to incapacitate temporarily.\u201dIbid.Violations are\npunishable by a fine of $500 to $1,000, imprisonment of 6 months to\n2\u00bd years, or both.Ibid.2Stun guns like Caetano\u2019s\n\u201care designed to stun a person with an electrical current\u201d by\nrunning a current between two metal prongs on the device and\nplacing the prongs in direct contact with the person. 470 Mass.\n774, 775, n.\u00a02, 26 N.\u00a0E. 3d 688, 689, n.\u00a02 (2015). A\nsimilar device, popularly known by the brand name \u201cTaser,\u201d shoots\nout wires tipped with electrodes that can deliver an electrical\ncurrent from a distance. Tr. 25\u201326. Tasers can also be used like a\nstun gun without deploying the electrodes\u2014a so-called \u201cdry stun.\u201dId.,at 26. As the Commonwealth\u2019s witness testified at\ntrial, these sorts of electrical weapons are \u201cnon-lethal force\u201d\n\u201cdesigned to incapacitate\u201d\u2014\u201cnot kill\u201d\u2014a target.Id.,at\n27.3Stun guns are plainly\n\u201cbearable arms.\u201d AsHellerexplained, the term includes any\n\u201c[w]eapo[n] of offence\u201d or \u201cthing that a man wears for his defence,\nor takes into his hands,\u201d that is \u201ccarr[ied] .\u00a0.\u00a0. for\nthe purpose of offensive or defensive action.\u201d 554 U.\u00a0S., at\n581, 584 (internal quotation marks omitted).4See J. Bilby, A\nRevolution in Arms: A History of the First Repeating Rifles 23\n(2006). Samuel Colt did not patent his famous revolver until 1836.Ibid.5See Firearms: An\nIllustrated History 166 (2014); see also W.

E. 3d, at 695. But\nthe law was changed in 2014, after Caetano was convicted. A spray\ncan also be foiled by a stiff breeze, while a stun gun\ncannot.",
