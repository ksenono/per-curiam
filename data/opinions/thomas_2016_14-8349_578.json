In the decades since, Foster has sought\nto vacate his conviction and death sentence on the ground that\nprosecutors violatedBatsonv.Kentucky, 476\nU.\u00a0S. 79 (1986) , when they struck all black prospective\njurors before his trial. Time and again, the state courts have\nrejected that claim. The trial court twice rejected it, and the\nSupreme Court of Georgia unequivocally rejected it when Foster\ndirectly appealed his conviction and sentence.Fosterv.State, 258 Ga. 736, 736, n.\u00a01, 738\u2013739, 374\nS.\u00a0E.\u00a02d 188, 190, n.\u00a01, 192 (1988), cert. denied,\n490 U.\u00a0S. 1085 (1989) . A state habeas court rejected it in\n2013. App. 175\u2013176, 192\u2013196. And most recently, the Supreme Court\nof Georgia again rejected it as lacking \u201carguable merit,\u201d Ga. Sup.\nCt. Rule 36 (2001). See App. 246.Yet, today\u2014nearly three decades removed fromvoir\u00a0dire\u2014the Court rules in Foster\u2019s favor. It does so\nwithout adequately grappling with the possibility that we lack\njurisdiction. Moreover, the Court\u2019s ruling on the merits, based, in\npart, on new evidence that Foster procured decades after his\nconviction, distorts the deferentialBatsoninquiry. I\nrespectfully dissent.IFederal law authorizes us to review the\n\u201cjudgments or decrees rendered by the highest court of a State in\nwhich a decision could be had,\u201d 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71257(a), but\nonly if such a judgment or decree raises a question of federal law,Michiganv.Long, 463 U.\u00a0S. 1032, 1038 (1983) .\nThe Court today errs by assuming that the Supreme Court of\nGeorgia\u2019s one-line order\u2014the \u201cjudgmen[t] .\u00a0.\u00a0. rendered\nby the highest court of a State in which a decision could be had,\u201d\n\u00a71257\u2014raises such a question. Seeante,at 7\u20138. The far more\nlikely explanation for the court\u2019s denial of habeas relief is that\nFoster\u2019s claim is procedurally barred. This disposition is\nordinarily a question of state law that this Court is powerless to\nreview. Before addressing the merits of Foster\u2019sBatsonclaim, the Court should have sought clarification that the\nresolution of a federal question was implicated in the Georgia high\ncourt\u2019s decision.AThe Supreme Court of Georgia\u2019s order in this\ncase states in full: \u201cUpon consideration of the Application for\nCertificate of Probable Cause to appeal the denial of habeas\ncorpus, it is ordered that it be hereby denied.\u201d App. 246. Neither\nthat order nor Georgia law provides adequate assurance that this\ncase raises a federal question.Under Georgia law, a state prisoner may file a\nstate habeas petition in a state superior court. Ga. Code Ann.\n\u00a7\u00a79\u201314\u201341 to 9\u201314\u201343 (2015). If the state superior court denies the\npetition, then the prisoner may appeal to the Supreme Court of\nGeorgia, which has exclusive jurisdiction over habeas corpus cases,\nby timely filing a notice of appeal in the superior court and\napplying for a certificate of probable cause in the supreme court.\nSeeFullwoodv.Sivley, 271 Ga. 248, 250\u2013251, 517\nS.\u00a0E.\u00a02d 511, 513\u2013515 (1999) (discussing requirements of\n\u00a79\u201314\u201352). Much like certificates of appealability in federal\ncourt,Miller-Elv.Cockrell, 537 U.\u00a0S. 322, 336\n(2003) , a Georgia prisoner must establish in his application that\nat least one of his claims has \u201carguable merit.\u201d Ga. Sup. Ct. Rule\n36. If he cannot, the Supreme Court of Georgia summarily denies\nrelief by denying the certificate of probable cause.Ibid.;\nsee also \u00a79\u201314\u201352(b);Hittsonv.GDCP Warden, 759 F.\n3d 1210, 1231\u20131232 (CA11 2014). If he can, then the court affords\nplenary review of the arguably meritorious claim. See,e.g.,Searsv.Humphrey, 294 Ga. 117, 117\u2013118, 751\nS.\u00a0E.\u00a02d 365, 368 (2013);Hillmanv.Johnson, 297 Ga. 609, 611, 615, n.\u00a05, 774\nS.\u00a0E.\u00a02d 615, 617, 620, n.\u00a05 (2015). The most we can\nglean, therefore, from the summary denial of Foster\u2019s state habeas\npetition is that the Supreme Court of Georgia concluded that\nFoster\u2019s claim lacked \u201carguable merit.\u201dThe most obvious ground for deciding that\nFoster\u2019s claim lacked \u201carguable merit\u201d is that the Supreme Court of\nGeorgia already considered that claim and rejected it decades\nago.[1] Georgia law prohibits\nFoster from raising the same claim anew in his state habeas\npetition. See,e.g., Davisv.Thomas, 261 Ga. 687,\n689, 410 S.\u00a0E.\u00a02d 110, 112 (1991). \u201cIt is axiomatic\u201d in\nthe Georgia courts \u201cthat a habeas court is not to be used as a\nsubstitute for an appeal, or as a second appeal.\u201dWalkerv.Penn, 271 Ga. 609, 612, 523 S.\u00a0E.\u00a02d 325, 327\n(1999). Without such procedural bars, state prisoners could raise\nold claims again and again until they are declared victorious, and\nfinality would mean nothing. See Friendly, Is Innocence Irrelevant?\nCollateral Attack on Criminal Judgments, 38 U. Chi. L.\u00a0Rev.\n142, 145 (1970) (\u201cThe proverbial man from Mars would surely think\nwe must consider our system of criminal justice terribly bad if we\nare willing to tolerate such efforts at undoing judgments of\nconviction\u201d).I would think that this state-law defect in\nFoster\u2019s state habeas petition would be the end of the matter:\n\u201cBecause this Court has no power to review a state law\ndetermination that is sufficient to support the judgment,\nresolution of any independent federal ground for the decision could\nnot affect the judgment and would therefore be advisory.\u201dColemanv.Thompson, 501 U.\u00a0S. 722, 729 (1991) .\nIt is fundamental that this Court\u2019s \u201conly power over state\njudgments is to correct them to the extent that they incorrectly\nadjudge federal rights.\u201dHerbv.Pitcairn, 324\nU.\u00a0S. 117 \u2013126 (1945). If an adequate and independent\nstate-law ground bars Foster\u2019s claim, then the Court today has done\nnothing more than issue an impermissible advisory opinion.BTo assure itself of jurisdiction, the Court\nwrongly assumes that the one-line order before us implicates a\nfederal question. Seeante,at 7\u20138. The lurking state-law\nprocedural bar, according to the Court, is not anindependentstate-law ground because it \u201cdepends on a\nfederal constitutional ruling.\u201dAnte,at 7 (internal\nquotation marks omitted).I would not so hastily assume that the State\nSupreme Court\u2019s unelaborated order depends on the resolution of a\nfederal question without first seeking clarification from the\nSupreme Court of Georgia. To be sure, we often presume that a\n\u201cstate court decide[s] the case the way it did because it believed\nthat federal law required it to do so.\u201dLong, 463\nU.\u00a0S., at 1040\u20131041. But there still exist \u201ccertain\ncircumstances in which clarification [from the state court] is\nnecessary or desirable\u201d before delving into the merits of a state\ncourt\u2019s decision.Id.,at 1041, n.\u00a06.This case presents such a circumstance. TheLongpresumption assumes that the ambiguous state-court\nruling will come in the form of a reasoned decision: It applies in\ncases in which \u201cit is not clear from theopinion itselfthat\nthe state court relied upon an adequate and independent state\nground and when itfairly appearsthat the state court\nrested its decision primarily on federal law.\u201dId.,at 1042\n(emphasis added). But here, when the decision is a one-line\njudgment, it hardly makes sense to invoke theLongpresumption. There is neither an \u201copinion\u201d nor any resolution of\nfederal law that \u201cfairly appears\u201d on the face of the unexplained\norder.Ibid.Confronted with cases like this in the past,\nthis Court has vacated and remanded for clarification from the\nstate court before proceeding to decide the merits of the\nunderlying claim. I would follow that path instead of assuming that\nthe one-line order implicates a federal question. We have\n\u201cdecline[d] .\u00a0.\u00a0. to review the federal questions\nasserted to be present\u201d when \u201c\u00a0\u2018there is considerable\nuncertainty as to the precise grounds for the [state court\u2019s]\ndecision.\u2019\u00a0\u201dBushv.Palm Beach County Canvassing\nBd., 531 U.\u00a0S. 70, 78 (2000) (per curiam) (quotingMinnesotav.National Tea Co., 309 U.\u00a0S. 551,\n555 (1940) ).A\u00a0fortiori, when a State\u2019s highest court\nhas denied relief without any explanation, the proper course is to\nvacate and remand for clarification before reaching the merits of a\nfederal question that might have nothing to do with the state\ncourt\u2019s decision. See,e.g., Capital Cities Media, Inc.v.Toole, 466 U.\u00a0S. 378 (1984) (per curiam); see\nalso,e.g., Johnsonv.Risk, 137 U.\u00a0S. 300 \u2013307\n(1890). This course respects weighty federalism concerns. \u201cIt is\nfundamental that state courts be left free and unfettered by us\u201d in\ninterpreting their own law,National Tea Co.,supra,\nat 557, especially when a state prisoner\u2019s long-final conviction is\nat stake.Clarification is especially warranted here.\nNothing in the reported decisions of the Supreme Court of Georgia\nsuggests that federal law figures in how Georgia applies its res\njudicata procedural bar. Those decisions state that \u201cnew law or new\nfacts\u201d could \u201cjustify the reconsideration of the claims\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. raised on direct appeal,\u201dHallv.Lance, 286 Ga. 365, 376\u2013377, 687 S.\u00a0E.\u00a02d 809, 818\n(2010), as might a showing that the prisoner is actually innocent,Walker,supra, at 611, 523 S.\u00a0E.\u00a02d, at\n327. But it is for the Supreme Court of Georgia\u2014not this Court\u2014to\ndecide what new facts suffice to reopen a claim already decided\nagainst a state habeas petitioner. It is up to the Georgia courts,\nfor example, to decide whether a petitioner was diligent in\ndiscovering those new facts, see,e.g., Gibsonv.Head, 282 Ga. 156, 159, 646 S.\u00a0E.\u00a02d 257, 260\n(2007) (noting that whether a petitioner could overcome the\nprocedural bar \u201cdepend[ed] on factual findings\u201d including \u201cthe\nprecise timing of [his] discovery of\u201d the new evidence), or whether\nthe new facts are \u201cmaterial,\u201dRollfv.Carter, 298\nGa. 557, 558, ___ S.\u00a0E.\u00a02d ___, ___ (2016).Instead of leaving the application of Georgia\nlaw to the Georgia courts, the Court takes it upon itself to decide\nthat the procedural bar implicates a federal question. Worse still,\nthe Court surmises that Georgia\u2019s procedural bar depends on the\nresolution of a federal question by parsing the wrong court\u2019s\ndecision, the opinion of the Superior Court of Butts County.Ante,at 7\u20138. InvokingAkev.Oklahoma, 470\nU.\u00a0S. 68, 75 (1985) , the Court reasons that \u201cthe state\nhabeas court\u2019sapplication of res judicata to Foster\u2019sBatsonclaim was not independent of the merits of his\nfederal constitutional challenge.\u201dAnte,at 8.(emphasis added). Accordingly, whether Foster has alleged a\nsufficient \u201c\u00a0\u2018change in the facts\u2019\u00a0\u201d to overcome the\nGeorgia procedural bar depends on whether Foster\u2019sBatsonclaim would succeed in light of those changed facts.Ante,at 7\u20138. But the State Superior Court\u2019s opinion is not the\n\u201cjudgmen[t] .\u00a0.\u00a0. by the highest court of [Georgia] in\nwhich a decision could be had\u201d subject to our certiorari\njurisdiction. 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71257. The unexplained denial\nof relief by the Supreme Court of Georgia is.I cannot go along with the Court\u2019s decision to\nassure itself of its jurisdiction by attributing snippets of the\nState Superior Court\u2019s reasoning to the Supreme Court of Georgia.\nThe reported decisions of the Supreme Court of Georgia do not\nresolve what \u201ctype of new alleged facts .\u00a0.\u00a0. could ever\nwarrant setting aside the procedural bar,\u201dHall, supra,at\n377, 687 S.\u00a0E.\u00a02d, at 818, let alone intimate that a\nprisoner may relitigate a claim already decided against him merely\nbecause he might win this second time around. Cf.Roulainv.Martin, 266 Ga. 353, 354, 466 S.\u00a0E.\u00a02d 837, 839\n(1996) (opining that a state habeas court \u201cwould certainly be bound\nby the ruling [in the petitioner\u2019s direct appeal] regardless of\nwhether that ruling may be erroneous\u201d). I therefore refuse to\npresume that the unexplained denial of relief by the Supreme Court\nof Georgia presents a federal question.[2]The Court today imposes an opinion-writing\nrequirement on the States\u2019 highest courts. Lest those high courts\nbe subject to lengthy digressions on constitutional claims that\nmight (or might not) be at issue, they must offer reasoned opinions\nwhy\u2014after rejecting the same claim decades ago\u2014they refuse to grant\nhabeas relief now. But \u201c[o]pinion-writing practices in state courts\nare influenced by considerations other than avoiding scrutiny by\ncollateral attack in federal court,\u201d including \u201cconcentrat[ing\ntheir] resources on the cases where opinions are most needed.\u201dHarringtonv.Richter, 562 U.\u00a0S. 86, 99 (2011) .\nRather than demand detailed opinions of overburdened state courts,\nthe Court should vacate and remand cases such as this one to assure\nitself of its jurisdiction.IIThe Court further errs by deciding that\nFoster\u2019sBatsonclaim has arguable merit. Because the\nadjudication of hisBatsonclaim is, at bottom, a\ncredibility determination, we owe \u201cgreat deference\u201d to the state\ncourt\u2019s initial finding that the prosecution\u2019s race-neutral reasons\nfor striking veniremen Eddie Hood and Marilyn Garrett were\ncredible.Batson, 476 U.\u00a0S., at 98, n.\u00a021. On a\nrecord far less cold than today\u2019s, the Supreme Court of Georgia\nlong ago (on direct appeal) rejected that claim by giving great\ndeference to the trial court\u2019s credibility determinations.\nEvaluating the strike of venireman Hood, the court highlighted that\nhis son had been convicted of a misdemeanor and that both his\ndemeanor and religious affiliation indicated that he might be\nreluctant to impose the death penalty.Foster, 258 Ga., at\n738, 374 S.\u00a0E.\u00a02d, at 192.And the prosecution\nreasonably struck venireman Garrett, according to the court,\nbecause it feared that she would sympathize with Foster given her\nwork with \u201clow-income, underprivileged children\u201d and because she\nwas \u201crelated to someone with a drug or alcohol problem.\u201dId.,at 739, 374 S.\u00a0E. 2d, at 192. That should have\nbeen the last word on Foster\u2019sBatsonclaim.But now, Foster has access to the prosecution\u2019s\nfile. By allowing Foster to relitigate hisBatsonclaim by\nbringing this newly discovered evidence to the fore, the Court\nupendsBatson\u2019s deferential framework. Foster\u2019s new evidence\ndoes not justify this Court\u2019s reassessment of who was telling the\ntruth nearly three decades removed fromvoir\u00a0dire.AThe new evidence sets the tone for the Court\u2019s\nanalysis, but a closer look reveals that it has limited probative\nvalue. For this reason, the Court\u2019s conclusion that the prosecution\nviolatedBatsonrests mostly on arguments at Foster\u2019s\ndisposal decades ago. Seeante,at 14\u201316 (concluding that\ntrial transcripts belie proffered reasons for striking Garrett);ante,at 17\u201322 (relying on transcripts and briefs as\nevidence of the prosecution\u2019s shifting explanations for striking\nHood). The new evidence is no excuse for the Court\u2019s reversal of\nthe state court\u2019s credibility determinations.As even the Court admits,ante,at 9\u201310,\nwe do not know who wrote most of the notes that Foster now relies\nupon as proof of the prosecutors\u2019 race-based motivations. We do\nknow, however, that both prosecutors averred that they \u201cdid not\nmake any of the highlighted marks on the jury venire list\u201d and \u201cdid\nnot instruct anyone to make the green highlighted marks.\u201d App.\n168\u2013169, 171. In particular, prosecutor Stephen Lanier reaffirmed\nhis earlier testimony, given during Foster\u2019s hearing for a new\ntrial, that he relied only on race-neutral factors in striking the\njury.Id., at 169; see alsoid., at 80\u2013125. And,\nprosecutor Douglas Pullen swore that he \u201cdid not rely on the\nhighlighted jury venire list.\u201dId., at 171.The hazy recollections of the prosecution\u2019s\ninvestigator, Clayton Lundy, are not to the contrary. As part of\nthe postconviction proceedings, Lundy testified that he \u201c[v]aguely\u201d\nremembered parts of jury selection, he \u201ckind of remember[ed]\u201d some\nof the documents used during jury selection, and cautioned that he\n\u201cain\u2019t done this in a long time.\u201d Tr. 181\u2013182. (When Lundy\ntestified in 2006, nearly 20 years had passed since Foster\u2019s trial\nand he had changed careers.Id., at 174.) He thought others\nat the district attorney\u2019s office \u201cprobably\u201d passed venire lists\naround the office and \u201cguess[ed]\u201d that everyone would make\nnotations.Id., at 182, 190.As for the other documents in the prosecution\u2019s\nfile, Lundy could not identify who authored any of them, with two\nexceptions.[3] First, Lundy\nsaid he prepared handwritten lists describing seven veniremen,\nincluding Garrett, but her race is not mentioned. Seeid.,\nat 205; App. 293\u2013294. Second, Lundy \u201cguess[ed]\u201d that prosecutor\nLanier suggested the handwritten edits to a draft of an affidavit\nthat Lundy later submitted to the trial court. Tr. 203; see App.\n343\u2013347 (draft affidavit);id., at 127\u2013129 (final\naffidavit). The relevant edits suggested deleting two statements\nthat, \u201csolely[in Lundy\u2019s]opinion,\u201d\nprosecutors ought to pick Garrett \u201c[i]f it comes down to having to\npick one of the black jurors.\u201dId., at 345 (emphasis added).\nPerhaps this look inside the district attorney\u2019s office reveals\nthat the office debated internally who would be the best black\njuror. Or perhaps it reveals only Lundy\u2019s personal thoughts about\nselecting black jurors, an \u201copinion\u201d with which (we can \u201cguess\u201d)\nLanier disagreed.The notion that this \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d\ncould warrant relitigation of aBatsonclaim is\nflabbergasting. InBatsoncases, the \u201cdecisive question will\nbe whether counsel\u2019s race-neutral explanation for a peremptory\nchallenge should be believed.\u201dHernandezv.New York,\n500 U.\u00a0S. 352, 365 (1991) (plurality opinion). And because\n\u201c[t]here will seldom be much evidence bearing on that issue,\u201d \u201cthe\nbest evidence often will be the demeanor of the attorney who\nexercises the challenge.\u201dIbid.Time and again, we have said\nthat the credibility of the attorney is best judged by the trial\ncourt and can be overturned only if it is clearly erroneous. Seeibid.; see alsoSnyderv.Louisiana, 552\nU.\u00a0S. 472, 477 (2008) ;Miller-El, 537 U.\u00a0S., at\n339;Hernandez,supra,at 375 (O\u2019Connor, J.,\nconcurring in judgment).But the Court today invites state prisoners to\ngo searching for new \u201cevidence\u201d by demanding the files of the\nprosecutors who long ago convicted them. If those prisoners\nsucceed, then apparently this Court\u2019s doors are open to conduct the\ncredibility determination anew. Alas, \u201cevery end is instead a new\nbeginning\u201d for a majority of this Court.Welchv.United\nStates,ante,at 15 (Thomas, J., dissenting). I cannot\ngo along with that \u201csort of sandbagging of state courts.\u201dMiller-Elv.Dretke, 545 U.\u00a0S. 231, 279 (2005)\n(Thomas, J., dissenting). New evidence should not justify the\nrelitigation ofBatsonclaims.BPerhaps the Court\u2019s decision to reconsider a\ndecades-oldBatsonclaim based on newly discovered evidence\nwould be less alarming if the new evidence revealed that the trial\ncourt had misjudged the prosecutors\u2019 reasons for striking Garrett\nand Hood. It does not. Not only is the probative value of the\nevidence severely limited,supra,at 8\u201311, but also pieces\nof the new evidence corroborate the trial court\u2019s conclusion that\nthe race-neutral reasons were valid. The Court\u2019s substitution of\nits judgment for the trial court\u2019s credibility determinations is\nflawed both as a legal and factual matter.1The Court\u2019s analysis with respect to Hood is\nunavailing. The Court first compares Hood with other jurors who had\nsimilarly aged children,ante,at 18\u201319, just as the trial\ncourt did decades ago, App. 135\u2013136. The trial court was well aware\nthat Hood\u2019s son\u2019s conviction was for theft, not murder. But in the\nwords of the trial court, \u201cthe conviction is a distinction that\nmakes the difference\u201d between Hood and the other jurors, and the\nprosecution\u2019s \u201capprehension that this would tend to, perhaps only\nsubconsciously, make the venireman sympathetic to [Foster] was a\nrational one.\u201dIbid.Because \u201cthe trial court believe[d] the\nprosecutor\u2019s nonracial justification, and that finding is not\nclearly erroneous, that [should be] the end of the matter.\u201dHernandez,supra,at 375 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring in\njudgment).The Court also second-guesses the prosecution\u2019s\nstrike of Hood because of his questionable stance on the death\npenalty. The Court concludes that Hood\u2019s transcribed statements atvoir dire\u201cunequivocally voiced [Hood\u2019s] willingness to\nimpose the death penalty.\u201dAnte,at 22. There is nothing\nunequivocal about a decades-old record. Our case law requires the\nCourt to defer to the trial court\u2019s finding that the State\u2019s\nrace-neutral concerns about Hood\u2019s \u201csoft-spoken[ness] and\nslow[ness] in responding to the death penalty questions\u201d were\n\u201ccredible.\u201d App. 138; seeSnyder,supra,at 477\n(\u201c[R]ace-neutral reasons for peremptory challenges often invoke a\njuror\u2019s demeanor (e.g.,nervousness, inattention), making\nthe trial court\u2019s firsthand observations of even greater\nimportance\u201d). The \u201cevaluation of the prosecutor\u2019s state of mind\nbased on demeanor and credibility lies peculiarly within a trial\njudge\u2019s province.\u201dHernandez,supra,at 365\n(plurality opinion) (internal quotation marks omitted).The new evidence, moreover, supports the\nprosecution\u2019s concern about Hood\u2019s views on capital punishment. A\nhandwritten document in the prosecution\u2019s file stated that the\nChurch of Christ \u201cdoesn\u2019t take a stand on [the] Death Penalty.\u201d\nApp. 302. Perplexingly, the Court considers this proof that the\nprosecution misled the trial court about its reasons for striking\nHood.Ante,at 20\u201321. Hardly. That document further states\nthat capital punishment is an issue \u201cleft for each individual\nmember,\u201d App. 302, and thus in no way discredits the prosecutor\u2019s\nstatement that, in his experience, \u201cChurch of Christ people, while\nthey may not take a formal stand against the death penalty,\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. are very, very reluctant to vote for the death\npenalty.\u201dId., at 84. And other notes in the file say that\nHood gave \u201cslow D[eath] P[enalty] answers\u201d and that he \u201chesitated\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. when asked about [the] D[eath] P[enalty].\u201dId., at 295, 303. This new evidence supports the\nprosecution\u2019s stated reason for striking Hood\u2014that he, as a member\nof the Church of Christ, had taken an uncertain stance on capital\npunishment.2Likewise, the Court\u2019s evaluation of the strike\nof Garrett is riddled with error. The Court is vexed by a single\nmisrepresentation about the prosecution\u2019s decision to strike\nGarrett\u2014the prosecution stated that Garrett was listed as\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018questionable\u2019\u00a0\u201d but the new evidence reveals that\nGarrett was on the \u201c\u00a0\u2018definite NO\u2019s\u2019\u00a0\u201d list from the\nbeginning.Ante,at 13\u201314. But whether the prosecution\nplanned to strike Garrett all along or only at the last minute\nseems irrelevant to the more than 10 race-neutral reasons the\nprosecution supplied for striking Garrett.The prosecution feared that Garrett might\nsympathize with Foster at sentencing. She worked with disadvantaged\nchildren, she was young, and she failed to disclose that her cousin\nhad been recently arrested. See App. 55\u201357, 105. And prosecutors\nwere concerned that she gave short answers, appeared nervous, and\ndid not ask to be off the jury even though she was a divorced\nmother of two children and worked more than 70 hours per week. Seeid.,at 55\u201356, 93\u201394. The prosecution also stated repeatedly\nthat they were concerned about female jurors, who \u201cappear to be\nmore sympathetic .\u00a0.\u00a0. in .\u00a0.\u00a0. death penalty\ncase[s] than men.\u201dId., at 42; seeid.,at\n57.[4]Pieces of the new evidence support some of these\nconcerns. The notes in the prosecutors\u2019 file reveal that someone on\nthe prosecution team was aware that Garrett\u2019s cousin was Angela\nGarrett (who had been arrested for drug-related charges and fired\nfrom her job on the eve of trial,id., at 105, 129), that\nGarrett \u201cwould not look a[t] [the] C[our]t during V[oir] D[ire],\u201d\nthat she gave \u201cvery short answers,\u201d and that she \u201c[l]ooked @ floor\nduring D[eath] P[enalty]\u201d questioning.Id., at 293, 308.Nevertheless, the Court frets that these\nindisputably race-neutral reasons were pretextual. The Court\nengages in its own comparison of the jurors to highlight the\nprosecution\u2019s refusal to strike white jurors with similar\ncharacteristics.Ante,at 14\u201316. But as with venireman Hood,\nthe Georgia courts were faced with the same contentions regarding\nGarrett decades ago, and the Supreme Court of Georgia rightly\ndecided that the trial court\u2019s findings were worthy of deference.\nAfter conducting a post-trial hearing in which one of the\nprosecutors testified, App. 80\u2013125, the trial court credited the\nprosecution\u2019s concerns. The trial court, for example, agreed that\nGarrett\u2019s association with Head Start might be troubling and\n\u201cbelieve[d] that the state [was] honest in voicing its concern that\nthe combination of holding down two jobs and being the divorced\nmother of two indicates a less stable home environment,\u201d which \u201cwas\nthe prime defense in [Foster\u2019s] case.\u201dId., at 142; seeid.,at 141. Again, that should be \u201cthe end of the matter.\u201dHernandez,500 U.\u00a0S.,at 375 (O\u2019Connor, J.,\nconcurring in judgment).*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*Today, without first seeking clarification\nfrom Georgia\u2019s highest court that it decided a federal question,\nthe Court affords a death-row inmate another opportunity to\nrelitigate his long-final conviction. In few other circumstances\ncould I imagine the Court spilling so much ink over a factbound\nclaim arising from a state postconviction proceeding. It was the\ntrial court that observed the veniremen firsthand and heard them\nanswer the prosecution\u2019s questions, and its evaluation of the\nprosecution\u2019s credibility on this point is certainly far better\nthan this Court\u2019s nearly 30 years later. SeeHernandez,\nsupra, at 365 (plurality opinion). I respectfully dissent.Notes1That is obvious, in part,\nbecause the Superior Court rested on this procedural bar to deny\nFoster\u2019sBatsonclaim. See,e.g.,App. 175\u2013176. We\nneed not blind ourselves to that lurking state-law ground merely\nbecause the Supreme Court of Georgia denied relief in an\nunexplained order. As we would do in the federal habeas context, we\nmay \u201clook through\u201d to the last reasoned state-court opinion to\ndiscern whether that opinion rested on state-law procedural\ngrounds.Ylstv.Nunnemaker, 501 U.\u00a0S. 797, 806\n(1991) . If \u201cthe last reasoned opinion on the claim explicitly\nimposes a procedural default,\u201d then there is a rebuttable\npresumption \u201cthat a later decision rejecting the claim did not\nsilently disregard that bar and consider the merits.\u201dId.,at 803; see also,e.g.,Kernanv.Hinojosa,ante, at 3 (per curiam). We presume, in other\nwords, that the decision rests on a question of state law. That\npresumption arguably plays an even more important role in a\nstate-court case like this, where a state-law procedural defect\nwould oust this Court of its jurisdiction. SeeColemanv.Thompson, 501 U.\u00a0S. 722, 730 (1991) (distinguishing a\nstate-law procedural bar\u2019s effect on a state case from its effect\nin federal habeas).2The Court takes me to\ntask for not \u201cfollow[ing my] own rule,\u201dante,at 8\u20139,\nn.\u00a03, because I acknowledge that the State Superior Court\u2019s\ndecision is strong evidence that Foster\u2019s claim was denied as\nprocedurally defaulted. Seesupra,at 3\u20134, and n.\u00a01. It\nis one thing to look to the reasoning of a lower state court\u2019s\ndecision to confirm that the Courtlacksjurisdiction. It is\nquite another for the Court to probe that lower state court\u2019s\ndecision toassureitself of jurisdiction. The Court reads\nthe tea leaves of a single State Superior Court\u2019s decision to\ndecide that the state-law procedural bar depends on the resolution\nof a federal question. That is a question of Georgia law that is\nbest answered by the decisions of the Supreme Court of Georgia. SeeCommissionerv.Estate of Bosch, 387 U.\u00a0S. 456,\n465 (1967) (concluding that when \u201cthe underlying substantive rule\ninvolved is based on state law,\u201d \u201cthe State\u2019s highest court is the\nbest authority on its own law\u201d); cf.Kingv.Order of\nUnited Commercial Travelers of America, 333 U.\u00a0S. 153 \u2013162\n(1948) (rejecting an unreported state trial court decision as\nbinding underErie R. Co.v.Tompkins, 304 U.\u00a0S.\n64 (1938) ).3At oral argument, counsel\nfor Georgia also stipulated that \u201cone of the two prosecutors\u201d must\nhave drafted another document comprising a \u201cdefinite NO\u2019s\u201d list and\na \u201cquestionables\u201d list of veniremen. Tr. of Oral Arg. 45; App. 301.\nBoth veniremen Hood and Garrett appeared on the \u201cdefinite NO\u2019s\u201d\nlist. Of course we cannot know when these lists were created, or\nwhether Lanier himself relied upon them. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 45\n(calling into question whether Lanier\u2019s \u201cthought process\u201d was based\non those lists).4This Court\u2019s decision inJ. E. B.v.Alabama ex\u00a0rel. T. B., 511\nU.\u00a0S. 127 (1994) , which held that peremptory strikes on the\nbasis of sex were unconstitutional, postdated Foster\u2019s direct\nappeal.",
