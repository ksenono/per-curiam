Bruen, in his\nofficial capacity as Superintendent of New York State Police,\net\u00a0al.on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the second circuit[June 23, 2022]Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the\nCourt.InDistrict of Columbiav.Heller,554 U.S.\n570(2008), andMcDonaldv.Chicago,561 U.S.\n742(2010), we recognized that the Second and Fourteenth\nAmendments protect the right of an ordinary, law-abiding citizen to\npossess a handgun in the home for self-defense. In this case,\npetitioners and respondents agree that ordinary, law-abiding\ncitizens have a similar right to carry handguns publicly for their\nself-defense. We too agree, and now hold, consistent withHellerandMcDonald, that the Second and Fourteenth\nAmendments protect an individual\u2019s right to carry a handgun for\nself-defense outside the home.The parties nevertheless dispute whether New\nYork\u2019s licensing regime respects the constitutional right to carry\nhandguns publicly for self-defense. In 43 States, the government\nissues licenses to carry based on objective criteria. But in six\nStates, including New York, the government further conditions\nissuance of a license to carry on a citizen\u2019s showing of some\nadditional special need. Because the State of New York issues\npublic-carry licenses only when an applicant demonstrates a special\nneed for self-defense, we conclude that the State\u2019s licensing\nregime violates the Constitution.IANew York State has regulated the public carry\nof handguns at least since the early 20th century. In 1905, New\nYork made it a misdemeanor for anyone over the age of 16 to \u201chave\nor carry concealed upon his person in any city or village of [New\nYork], any pistol, revolver or other firearm without a written\nlicense .\u00a0.\u00a0. issued to him by a police magistrate.\u201d 1905\nN.\u00a0Y. Laws ch. 92, \u00a72, pp.\u00a0129\u2013130; see also 1908\nN.\u00a0Y. Laws ch. 93, \u00a71, pp.\u00a0242\u2013243 (allowing justices of\nthe peace to issue licenses). In 1911, New York\u2019s \u201cSullivan Law\u201d\nexpanded the State\u2019s criminal prohibition to the possession of all\nhandguns\u2014concealed or otherwise\u2014without a government-issued\nlicense. See 1911 N.\u00a0Y. Laws ch. 195, \u00a71, p.\u00a0443. New\nYork later amended the Sullivan Law to clarify the licensing\nstandard: Magistrates could \u201cissue to [a] person a license to have\nand carry concealed a pistol or revolver without regard to\nemployment or place of possessing such weapon\u201d only if that person\nproved \u201cgood moral character\u201d and \u201cproper cause.\u201d 1913 N.\u00a0Y.\nLaws ch. 608, \u00a71, p.\u00a01629.Today\u2019s licensing scheme largely tracks that of\nthe early 1900s. It is a crime in New York to possess \u201cany firearm\u201d\nwithout a license, whether inside or outside the home, punishable\nby up to four years in prison or a $5,000 fine for a felony\noffense, and one year in prison or a $1,000 fine for a misdemeanor.\nSee N.\u00a0Y. Penal Law Ann. \u00a7\u00a7265.01\u2013b (West 2017), 261.01(1)\n(West Cum. Supp. 2022), 70.00(2)(e) and (3)(b), 80.00(1)(a) (West\n2021), 70.15(1), 80.05(1). Meanwhile, possessing a loaded firearm\noutside one\u2019s home or place of business without a license is a\nfelony punishable by up to 15 years in prison. \u00a7\u00a7265.03(3) (West\n2017), 70.00(2)(c) and (3)(b), 80.00(1)(a).A license applicant who wants to possess a\nfirearmat home(or in his place of business) must convince\na \u201clicensing officer\u201d\u2014usually a judge or law enforcement\nofficer\u2014that, among other things, he is of good moral character,\nhas no history of crime or mental illness, and that \u201cno good cause\nexists for the denial of the license.\u201d \u00a7\u00a7400.00(1)(a)\u2013(n) (West\nCum. Supp. 2022). If he wants to carry a firearmoutsidehis\nhome or place of business for self-defense, the applicant must\nobtain an unrestricted license to \u201chave and carry\u201d a concealed\n\u201cpistol or revolver.\u201d \u00a7400.00(2)(f\u00a0). To secure that license,\nthe applicant must prove that \u201cproper cause exists\u201d to issue it.Ibid.If an applicant cannot make that showing, he can\nreceive only a \u201crestricted\u201d license for public carry, which allows\nhim to carry a firearm for a limited purpose, such as hunting,\ntarget shooting, or employment. See,e.g.,In\u00a0re\nO\u2019Brien,87 N.Y.2d 436, 438\u2013439,663 N.E.2d 316, 316\u2013317 (1996);Babernitzv.Police\nDept. of City of New York, 65 App. Div. 2d 320, 324, 411\nN.Y.S.2d 309, 311 (1978);In\u00a0re O\u2019Connor, 154 Misc. 2d\n694, 696\u2013698, 585 N.Y.S.2d 1000, 1003 (Westchester Cty. 1992).No New York statute defines \u201cproper cause.\u201d But\nNew York courts have held that an applicant shows proper cause only\nif he can \u201cdemonstrate a special need for self-protection\ndistinguishable from that of the general community.\u201dE.g.,In\u00a0re Klenosky, 75 App. Div. 2d 793, 428 N.Y.S.2d 256,\n257 (1980). This \u201cspecial need\u201d standard is demanding. For example,\nliving or working in an area \u201c\u00a0\u2018noted for criminal\nactivity\u2019\u00a0\u201d does not suffice.In\u00a0re Bernstein, 85\nApp. Div. 2d 574, 445 N.Y.S.2d 716, 717 (1981). Rather, New York\ncourts generally require evidence \u201cof particular threats, attacks\nor other extraordinary danger to personal safety.\u201dIn\u00a0re\nMartinek, 294 App. Div. 2d 221, 222, 743 N.Y.S.2d 80, 81\n(2002); see alsoIn\u00a0re Kaplan, 249 App. Div. 2d 199,\n201, 673 N.Y.S.2d 66, 68 (1998) (approving the New York City Police\nDepartment\u2019s requirement of \u201c\u00a0\u2018extraordinary personal danger,\ndocumented by proof of recurrent threats to life or safety\u2019\u00a0\u201d\n(quoting 38 N.\u00a0Y.\u00a0C.\u00a0R.\u00a0R. \u00a75\u201303(b))).When a licensing officer denies an application,\njudicial review is limited. New York courts defer to an officer\u2019s\napplication of the proper-cause standard unless it is \u201carbitrary\nand capricious.\u201dIn\u00a0re Bando, 290 App. Div. 2d 691,\n692, 735 N.Y.S.2d 660, 661 (2002). In other words, the decision\n\u201cmust be upheld if the record shows a rational basis for it.\u201dKaplan, 249 App. Div. 2d, at 201, 673 N.\u00a0Y.\u00a0S. 2d,\nat 68. The rule leaves applicants little recourse if their local\nlicensing officer denies a permit.New York is not alone in requiring a permit to\ncarry a handgun in public. But the vast majority of States\u201443 by\nour count\u2014are \u201cshall issue\u201d jurisdictions, where authorities must\nissue concealed-carry licenses whenever applicants satisfy certain\nthreshold requirements, without granting licensing officials\ndiscretion to deny licenses based on a perceived lack of need or\nsuitability.[1] Meanwhile, only\nsix States and the District of Columbia have \u201cmay issue\u201d licensing\nlaws, under which authorities have discretion to deny\nconcealed-carry licenses even when the applicant satisfies the\nstatutory criteria, usually because the applicant has not\ndemonstrated cause or suitability for the relevant license. Aside\nfrom New York, then, only California, the District of Columbia,\nHawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, and New Jersey have analogues to\nthe \u201cproper cause\u201d standard.[2]\nAll of these \u201cproper cause\u201d analogues have been upheld by the\nCourts of Appeals, save for the District of Columbia\u2019s, which has\nbeen permanently enjoined since 2017. CompareGouldv.Morgan, 907 F.3d 659, 677 (CA1 2018);Kachalskyv.County of Westchester, 701 F.3d 81, 101 (CA2 2012);Drakev.Filko, 724 F.3d 426, 440 (CA3 2013);United Statesv.Masciandaro, 638 F.3d 458, 460 (CA4\n2011);Youngv.Hawaii, 992 F.3d 765, 773 (CA9 2021)\n(en banc), withWrennv.District of Columbia, 864\nF.3d 650, 668 (CADC 2017).BAs set forth in the pleadings below,\npetitioners Brandon Koch and Robert Nash are law-abiding, adult\ncitizens of Rensselaer County, New York. Koch lives in Troy, while\nNash lives in Averill Park. Petitioner New York State Rifle &\nPistol Association, Inc., is a public-interest group organized to\ndefend the Second Amendment rights of New Yorkers. Both Koch and\nNash are members.In 2014, Nash applied for an unrestricted\nlicense to carry a handgun in public. Nash did not claim any unique\ndanger to his personal safety; he simply wanted to carry a handgun\nfor self-defense. In early 2015, the State denied Nash\u2019s\napplication for an unrestricted license but granted him a\nrestricted license for hunting and target shooting only. In late\n2016, Nash asked a licensing officer to remove the restrictions,\nciting a string of recent robberies in his neighborhood. After an\ninformal hearing, the licensing officer denied the request. The\nofficer reiterated that Nash\u2019s existing license permitted him \u201cto\ncarry concealed for purposes of off road back country, outdoor\nactivities similar to hunting,\u201d such as \u201cfishing, hiking &\ncamping etc.\u201d App. 41. But, at the same time, the officer\nemphasized that the restrictions were \u201cintended toprohibit[Nash] from carrying concealed in ANY LOCATION typically open to\nand frequented by the general public.\u201dIbid.Between 2008 and 2017, Koch was in the same\nposition as Nash: He faced no special dangers, wanted a handgun for\ngeneral self-defense, and had only a restricted license permitting\nhim to carry a handgun outside the home for hunting and target\nshooting. In late 2017, Koch applied to a licensing officer to\nremove the restrictions on his license, citing his extensive\nexperience in safely handling firearms. Like Nash\u2019s application,\nKoch\u2019s was denied, except that the officer permitted Koch to \u201ccarry\nto and from work.\u201dId., at 114.CRespondents are the superintendent of the New\nYork State Police, who oversees the enforcement of the State\u2019s\nlicensing laws, and a New York Supreme Court justice, who oversees\nthe processing of licensing applications in Rensselaer County.\nPetitioners sued respondents for declaratory and injunctive relief\nunder Rev. Stat. 1979, 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71983, alleging that\nrespondents violated their Second and Fourteenth Amendment rights\nby denying their unrestricted-license applications on the basis\nthat they had failed to show \u201cproper cause,\u201di.e., had\nfailed to demonstrate a unique need for self-defense.The District Court dismissed petitioners\u2019\ncomplaint and the Court of Appeals affirmed. See 818 Fed. Appx. 99,\n100 (CA2 2020). Both courts relied on the Court of Appeals\u2019 prior\ndecision inKachalsky, 701 F.3d 81, which had sustained New\nYork\u2019s proper-cause standard, holding that the requirement was\n\u201csubstantially related to the achievement of an important\ngovernmental interest.\u201dId., at 96.We granted certiorari to decide whether New\nYork\u2019s denial of petitioners\u2019 license applications violated the\nConstitution. 593 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2021).IIInHellerandMcDonald, we held\nthat the Second and Fourteenth Amendments protect an individual\nright to keep and bear arms for self-defense. In doing so, we held\nunconstitutional two laws that prohibited the possession and use of\nhandguns in the home. In the years since, the Courts of Appeals\nhave coalesced around a \u201ctwo-step\u201d framework for analyzing Second\nAmendment challenges that combines history with means-end\nscrutiny.Today, we decline to adopt that two-part\napproach. In keeping withHeller, we hold that when the\nSecond Amendment\u2019s plain text covers an individual\u2019s conduct, the\nConstitution presumptively protects that conduct. To justify its\nregulation, the government may not simply posit that the regulation\npromotes an important interest. Rather, the government must\ndemonstrate that the regulation is consistent with this Nation\u2019s\nhistorical tradition of firearm regulation. Only if a firearm\nregulation is consistent with this Nation\u2019s historical tradition\nmay a court conclude that the individual\u2019s conduct falls outside\nthe Second Amendment\u2019s \u201cunqualified command.\u201dKonigsbergv.State Bar of Cal.,366 U.S.\n36, 50, n.\u00a010 (1961).[3]ASinceHellerandMcDonald, the\ntwo-step test that Courts of Appeals have developed to assess\nSecond Amendment claims proceeds as follows. At the first step, the\ngovernment may justify its regulation by \u201cestablish[ing] that the\nchallenged law regulates activity falling outside the scope of the\nright as originally understood.\u201dE.g.,Kanterv.Barr, 919 F.3d 437, 441 (CA7 2019) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). But seeUnited Statesv.Boyd, 999 F.3d\n171, 185 (CA3 2021) (requiring claimant to show \u201c\u00a0\u2018a burden on\nconduct falling within the scope of the Second Amendment\u2019s\nguarantee\u2019\u00a0\u201d). The Courts of Appeals then ascertain the\noriginal scope of the right based on its historical meaning.E.g.,United Statesv.Focia, 869 F.3d 1269,\n1285 (CA11 2017). If the government can prove that the regulated\nconduct falls beyond the Amendment\u2019s original scope, \u201cthen the\nanalysis can stop there; the regulated activity is categorically\nunprotected.\u201dUnited Statesv.Greeno, 679 F.3d 510,\n518 (CA6 2012) (internal quotation marks omitted). But if the\nhistorical evidence at this step is \u201cinconclusive or suggests that\nthe regulated activity isnotcategorically unprotected,\u201d\nthe courts generally proceed to step two.Kanter, 919\nF.\u00a03d, at 441 (internal quotation marks omitted).At the second step, courts often analyze \u201chow\nclose the law comes to the core of the Second Amendment right and\nthe severity of the law\u2019s burden on that right.\u201dIbid.(internal quotation marks omitted).The Courts of Appeals\ngenerally maintain \u201cthat the core Second Amendment right is limited\nto self-defensein the home.\u201dGould, 907 F.\u00a03d,\nat 671 (emphasis added). But seeWrenn, 864 F.\u00a03d, at\n659 (\u201c[T]he Amendment\u2019s core generally covers carrying in public\nfor self defense\u201d). If a \u201ccore\u201d Second Amendment right is burdened,\ncourts apply \u201cstrict scrutiny\u201d and ask whether the Government can\nprove that the law is \u201cnarrowly tailored to achieve a compelling\ngovernmental interest.\u201dKolbev.Hogan, 849 F.3d 114,\n133 (CA4 2017) (internal quotation marks omitted). Otherwise, they\napply intermediate scrutiny and consider whether the Government can\nshow that the regulation is \u201csubstantially related to the\nachievement of an important governmental interest.\u201dKachalsky, 701 F.\u00a03d, at 96.[4] Both respondents and the United States largely agree\nwith this consensus, arguing that intermediate scrutiny is\nappropriate when text and history are unclear in attempting to\ndelineate the scope of the right. See Brief for Respondents 37;\nBrief for United States asAmicus Curiae4.BDespite the popularity of this two-step\napproach, it is one step too many. Step one of the predominant\nframework is broadly consistent withHeller, which demands a\ntest rooted in the Second Amendment\u2019s text, as informed by history.\nButHellerandMcDonalddo not support applying\nmeans-end scrutiny in the Second Amendment context. Instead, the\ngovernment must affirmatively prove that its firearms regulation is\npart of the historical tradition that delimits the outer bounds of\nthe right to keep and bear arms.1To show whyHellerdoes not support\napplying means-end scrutiny, we first summarizeHeller\u2019s\nmethodological approach to the Second Amendment.InHeller, we began with a \u201ctextual\nanalysis\u201d focused on the \u201c\u00a0\u2018normal and ordinary\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nmeaning of the Second Amendment\u2019s language. 554 U.\u00a0S., at\n576\u2013577, 578. That analysis suggested that the Amendment\u2019s\noperative clause\u2014\u201cthe right of the people to keep and bear Arms\nshall not be infringed\u201d\u2014\u201cguarantee[s] the individual right to\npossess and carry weapons in case of confrontation\u201d that does not\ndepend on service in the militia.Id., at 592.From there, we assessed whether our initial\nconclusion was \u201cconfirmed by the historical background of the\nSecond Amendment.\u201dIbid.We looked to history because \u201cit\nhas always been widely understood that the Second Amendment\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. codified apre-existingright.\u201dIbid.The Amendment \u201cwas not intended to lay down a novel principle but\nrather codified a right inherited from our English ancestors.\u201dId., at 599 (alterations and internal quotation marks\nomitted). After surveying English history dating from the late\n1600s, along with American colonial views leading up to the\nfounding, we found \u201cno doubt, on the basis of both text and\nhistory, that the Second Amendment conferred an individual right to\nkeep and bear arms.\u201dId., at 595.We then canvassed the historical record and\nfound yet further confirmation. That history included the\n\u201canalogous arms-bearing rights in state constitutions that preceded\nand immediately followed adoption of the Second Amendment,\u201did., at 600\u2013601, and \u201chow the Second Amendment was\ninterpreted from immediately after its ratification through the end\nof the 19th century,\u201did., at 605. When the principal\ndissent charged that the latter category of sources was\nillegitimate \u201cpostenactment legislative history,\u201did., at\n662, n.\u00a028 (opinion of Stevens, J.), we clarified that\n\u201cexamination of a variety of legal and other sources to determinethe public understandingof a legal text in the period after\nits enactment or ratification\u201d was \u201ca critical tool of\nconstitutional interpretation,\u201did., at 605 (majority\nopinion).In assessing the postratification history, we\nlooked to four different types of sources. First, we reviewed\n\u201c[t]hree important founding-era legal scholars [who] interpreted\nthe Second Amendment in published writings.\u201dIbid.Second,\nwe looked to \u201c19th-century cases that interpreted the Second\nAmendment\u201d and found that they \u201cuniversally support an individual\nright\u201d to keep and bear arms.Id., at 610. Third, we\nexamined the \u201cdiscussion of the Second Amendment in Congress and in\npublic discourse\u201d after the Civil War, \u201cas people debated whether\nand how to secure constitutional rights for newly freed slaves.\u201dId., at 614. Fourth, we considered how post-Civil War\ncommentators understood the right. Seeid., at 616\u2013619.After holding that the Second Amendment\nprotected an individual right to armed self-defense, we also relied\non the historical understanding of the Amendment to demark the\nlimits on the exercise of that right. We noted that, \u201c[l]ike most\nrights, the right secured by the Second Amendment is not\nunlimited.\u201dId., at 626. \u201cFrom Blackstone through the\n19th-century cases, commentators and courts routinely explained\nthat the right was not a right to keep and carry any weapon\nwhatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose.\u201dIbid.For example, we found it \u201cfairly supported by the\nhistorical tradition of prohibiting the carrying of \u2018dangerous and\nunusual weapons\u2019\u00a0\u201d that the Second Amendment protects the\npossession and use of weapons that are \u201c\u00a0\u2018in common use at the\ntime.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId., at 627 (first citing 4 W. Blackstone,\nCommentaries on the Laws of England 148\u2013149 (1769); then quotingUnited Statesv.Miller,307\nU.S. 174, 179 (1939)). That said, we cautioned that we were not\n\u201cundertak[ing] an exhaustive historical analysis today of the full\nscope of the Second Amendment\u201d and moved on to considering the\nconstitutionality of the District of Columbia\u2019s handgun ban. 554\nU.\u00a0S., at 627.We assessed the lawfulness of that handgun ban\nby scrutinizing whether it comported with history and tradition.\nAlthough we noted that the ban \u201cwould fail constitutional muster\u201d\n\u201c[u]nder any of the standards of scrutiny that we have applied to\nenumerated constitutional rights,\u201did., at 628\u2013629, we did\nnot engage in means-end scrutiny when resolving the constitutional\nquestion. Instead, we focused on the historically unprecedented\nnature of the District\u2019s ban, observing that \u201c[f]ew laws in the\nhistory of our Nation have come close to [that] severe\nrestriction.\u201dId., at 629. Likewise, when one of the\ndissents attempted to justify the District\u2019s prohibition with\n\u201cfounding-era historical precedent,\u201d including \u201cvarious restrictive\nlaws in the colonial period,\u201d we addressed each purported analogue\nand concluded that they were either irrelevant or \u201cd[id] not\nremotely burden the right of self-defense as much as an absolute\nban on handguns.\u201dId., at 631\u2013632; seeid., at\n631\u2013634. Thus, our earlier historical analysis sufficed to show\nthat the Second Amendment did not countenance a \u201ccomplete\nprohibition\u201d on the use of \u201cthe most popular weapon chosen by\nAmericans for self-defense in the home.\u201dId., at 629.2As the foregoing shows,Heller\u2019s\nmethodology centered on constitutional text and history. Whether it\ncame to defining the character of the right (individual or militia\ndependent), suggesting the outer limits of the right, or assessing\nthe constitutionality of a particular regulation,Hellerrelied on text and history. It did not invoke any means-end test\nsuch as strict or intermediate scrutiny.Moreover,HellerandMcDonaldexpressly rejected the application of any \u201cjudge-empowering\n\u2018interest-balancing inquiry\u2019 that \u2018asks whether the statute burdens\na protected interest in a way or to an extent that is out of\nproportion to the statute\u2019s salutary effects upon other important\ngovernmental interests.\u2019\u00a0\u201dHeller, 554 U.\u00a0S., at\n634 (quotingid., at 689\u2013690 (Breyer, J., dissenting)); see\nalsoMcDonald, 561 U.\u00a0S., at 790\u2013791 (plurality\nopinion) (the Second Amendment does not permit\u2014let alone\nrequire\u2014\u201cjudges to assess the costs and benefits of firearms\nrestrictions\u201d under means-end scrutiny). We declined to engage in\nmeans-end scrutiny because \u201c[t]he very enumeration of the right\ntakes out of the hands of government\u2014even the Third Branch of\nGovernment\u2014the power to decide on a case-by-case basis whether the\nright isreally worthinsisting upon.\u201dHeller, 554\nU.\u00a0S., at 634. We then concluded: \u201cA constitutional guarantee\nsubject to future judges\u2019 assessments of its usefulness is no\nconstitutional guarantee at all.\u201dIbid.Not only didHellerdecline to engage in\nmeans-end scrutiny generally, but it also specifically ruled out\nthe intermediate-scrutiny test that respondents and the United\nStates now urge us to adopt. Dissenting inHeller, Justice\nBreyer\u2019s proposed standard\u2014\u201cask[ing] whether [a] statute burdens a\nprotected interest in a way or to an extent that is out of\nproportion to the statute\u2019s salutary effects upon other important\ngovernmental interests,\u201did., at 689\u2013690 (dissenting\nopinion)\u2014simply expressed a classic formulation of intermediate\nscrutiny in a slightly different way, seeClarkv.Jeter,486 U.S.\n456, 461 (1988) (asking whether the challenged law is\n\u201csubstantially related to an important government objective\u201d). In\nfact, Justice Breyer all but admitted that hisHellerdissent advocated for intermediate scrutiny by repeatedly invoking\na quintessential intermediate- scrutiny precedent. SeeHeller, 554 U.\u00a0S., at 690, 696, 704\u2013705 (citingTurner Broadcasting System,Inc.v.FCC,520 U.S.\n180(1997)). Thus, whenHellerexpressly rejected that\ndissent\u2019s \u201cinterest-balancing inquiry,\u201d 554 U.\u00a0S., at 634\n(internal quotation marks omitted), it necessarily rejected\nintermediate scrutiny.[5]In sum, the Courts of Appeals\u2019 second step is\ninconsistent withHeller\u2019s historical approach and its\nrejection of means-end scrutiny. We reiterate that the standard for\napplying the Second Amendment is as follows: When the Second\nAmendment\u2019s plain text covers an individual\u2019s conduct, the\nConstitution presumptively protects that conduct. The government\nmust then justify its regulation by demonstrating that it is\nconsistent with the Nation\u2019s historical tradition of firearm\nregulation. Only then may a court conclude that the individual\u2019s\nconduct falls outside the Second Amendment\u2019s \u201cunqualified command.\u201dKonigsberg, 366 U.\u00a0S., at 50, n.\u00a010.CThis Second Amendment standard accords with\nhow we protect other constitutional rights. Take, for instance, the\nfreedom of speech in the First Amendment, to whichHellerrepeatedly compared the right to keep and bear arms. 554\nU.\u00a0S., at 582, 595, 606, 618, 634\u2013635. In that context,\n\u201c[w]hen the Government restricts speech, the Government bears the\nburden of proving the constitutionality of its actions.\u201dUnited\nStatesv.Playboy Entertainment Group,Inc.,529 U.S.\n803, 816 (2000); see alsoPhiladelphia Newspapers,Inc.v.Hepps,475 U.S.\n767, 777 (1986). In some cases, that burden includes showing\nwhether the expressive conduct falls outside of the category of\nprotected speech. SeeIllinois ex\u00a0rel. Madiganv.Telemarketing Associates,Inc.,538 U.S.\n600, 620, n.\u00a09 (2003). And to carry that burden, the\ngovernment must generally point tohistoricalevidence about\nthe reach of the First Amendment\u2019s protections. See,e.g.,United Statesv.Stevens,559\nU.S. 460, 468\u2013471 (2010) (placing the burden on the government\nto show that a type of speech belongs to a \u201chistoric and\ntraditional categor[y]\u201d of constitutionally unprotected speech\n\u201clong familiar to the bar\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).And beyond the freedom of speech, our focus on\nhistory also comports with how we assess many other constitutional\nclaims. If a litigant asserts the right in court to \u201cbe confronted\nwith the witnesses against him,\u201d U.\u00a0S. Const., Amdt. 6, we\nrequire courts to consult history to determine the scope of that\nright. See,e.g.,Gilesv.California,554 U.S.\n353, 358 (2008) (\u201cadmitting only those exceptions [to the\nConfrontation Clause] established at the time of the founding\u201d\n(internal quotation marks omitted)). Similarly, when a litigant\nclaims a violation of his rights under the Establishment Clause,\nMembers of this Court \u201cloo[k] to history for guidance.\u201dAmerican\nLegionv.American Humanist Assn., 588 U.\u00a0S. ___,\n___ (2019) (plurality opinion) (slip op., at 25). We adopt a\nsimilar approach here.To be sure, \u201c[h]istorical analysis can be\ndifficult; it sometimes requires resolving threshold questions, and\nmaking nuanced judgments about which evidence to consult and how to\ninterpret it.\u201dMcDonald, 561 U.\u00a0S., at 803\u2013804 (Scalia,\nJ., concurring). But reliance on history to inform the meaning of\nconstitutional text\u2014especially text meant to codify apre-existingright\u2014is, in our view, more legitimate, and\nmore administrable, than asking judges to \u201cmake difficult empirical\njudgments\u201d about \u201cthe costs and benefits of firearms restrictions,\u201d\nespecially given their \u201clack [of] expertise\u201d in the field.Id., at 790\u2013791 (plurality opinion).[6]If the last decade of Second Amendment\nlitigation has taught this Court anything, it is that federal\ncourts tasked with making such difficult empirical judgments\nregarding firearm regulations under the banner of \u201cintermediate\nscrutiny\u201d often defer to the determinations of legislatures. But\nwhile that judicial deference to legislative interest balancing is\nunderstandable\u2014and, elsewhere, appropriate\u2014it is not deference that\nthe Constitution demands here. The Second Amendment \u201cis the veryproductof an interest balancing by the people\u201d and it\n\u201csurely elevates above all other interests the right of\nlaw-abiding, responsible citizens to use arms\u201d for self-defense.Heller, 554 U.\u00a0S., at 635. It is this balance\u2014struck by\nthe traditions of the American people\u2014that demands our unqualified\ndeference.DThe test that we set forth inHellerand apply today requires courts to assess whether modern firearms\nregulations are consistent with the Second Amendment\u2019s text and\nhistorical understanding. In some cases, that inquiry will be\nfairly straightforward. For instance, when a challenged regulation\naddresses a general societal problem that has persisted since the\n18th century, the lack of a distinctly similar historical\nregulation addressing that problem is relevant evidence that the\nchallenged regulation is inconsistent with the Second Amendment.\nLikewise, if earlier generations addressed the societal problem,\nbut did so through materially different means, that also could be\nevidence that a modern regulation is unconstitutional. And if some\njurisdictions actually attempted to enact analogous regulations\nduring this timeframe, but those proposals were rejected on\nconstitutional grounds, that rejection surely would provide some\nprobative evidence of unconstitutionality.Helleritself exemplifies this kind of\nstraightforward historical inquiry. One of the District\u2019s\nregulations challenged inHeller\u201ctotally ban[ned] handgun\npossession in the home.\u201dId., at 628. The District inHelleraddressed a perceived societal problem\u2014firearm\nviolence in densely populated communities\u2014and it employed a\nregulation\u2014a flat ban on the possession of handguns in the\nhome\u2014that the Founders themselves could have adopted to confront\nthat problem. Accordingly, after considering \u201cfounding-era\nhistorical precedent,\u201d including \u201cvarious restrictive laws in the\ncolonial period,\u201d and finding that none was analogous to the\nDistrict\u2019s ban,Hellerconcluded that the handgun ban was\nunconstitutional.Id.,at 631; see alsoid.,at 634\n(describing the claim that \u201cthere were somewhat similar\nrestrictions in the founding period\u201d a \u201cfalse proposition\u201d).New York\u2019s proper-cause requirement concerns the\nsame alleged societal problem addressed inHeller: \u201chandgun\nviolence,\u201d primarily in \u201curban area[s].\u201dIbid.Following the\ncourse charted byHeller, we will consider whether\n\u201chistorical precedent\u201d from before, during, and even after the\nfounding evinces a comparable tradition of regulation.Id.,at 631. And, as we explain below, we find no such tradition in the\nhistorical materials that respondents and theiramicihave\nbrought to bear on that question. See Part III\u2013B,infra.While the historical analogies here and inHellerare relatively simple to draw, other cases\nimplicating unprecedented societal concerns or dramatic\ntechnological changes may require a more nuanced approach. The\nregulatory challenges posed by firearms today are not always the\nsame as those that preoccupied the Founders in 1791 or the\nReconstruction generation in 1868. Fortunately, the Founders\ncreated a Constitution\u2014and a Second Amendment\u2014\u201cintended to endure\nfor ages to come, and consequently, to be adapted to the various\ncrises of human affairs.\u201dMcCullochv.Maryland, 4\nWheat. 316, 415 (1819) (emphasis deleted). Although its meaning is\nfixed according to the understandings of those who ratified it, the\nConstitution can, and must, apply to circumstances beyond those the\nFounders specifically anticipated. See,e.g.,United\nStatesv.Jones,565 U.S.\n400, 404\u2013405 (2012) (holding that installation of a tracking\ndevice was \u201ca physical intrusion [that] would have been considered\na \u2018search\u2019 within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment when it was\nadopted\u201d).We have already recognized inHellerat\nleast one way in which the Second Amendment\u2019s historically fixed\nmeaning applies to new circumstances: Its reference to \u201carms\u201d does\nnot apply \u201conly [to] those arms in existence in the 18th century.\u201d\n554 U.\u00a0S., at 582. \u201cJust as the First Amendment protects\nmodern forms of communications, and the Fourth Amendment applies to\nmodern forms of search, the Second Amendment extends, prima facie,\nto all instruments that constitute bearable arms, even those that\nwere not in existence at the time of the founding.\u201dIbid.(citations omitted). Thus, even though the Second Amendment\u2019s\ndefinition of \u201carms\u201d is fixed according to its historical\nunderstanding, that general definition covers modern instruments\nthat facilitate armed self-defense. Cf.Caetanov.Massachusetts, 577 U.S. 411, 411\u2013412 (2016) (per\ncuriam) (stun guns).Much like we use history to determine which\nmodern \u201carms\u201d are protected by the Second Amendment, so too does\nhistory guide our consideration of modern regulations that were\nunimaginable at the founding. When confronting such present-day\nfirearm regulations, this historical inquiry that courts must\nconduct will often involve reasoning by analogy\u2014a commonplace task\nfor any lawyer or judge. Like all analogical reasoning, determining\nwhether a historical regulation is a proper analogue for a\ndistinctly modern firearm regulation requires a determination of\nwhether the two regulations are \u201crelevantly similar.\u201d C. Sunstein,\nOn Analogical Reasoning, 106 Harv. L.\u00a0Rev. 741, 773 (1993).\nAnd because \u201c[e]verything is similar in infinite ways to everything\nelse,\u201did.,at 774, one needs \u201csome metric enabling the\nanalogizer to assess which similarities are important and which are\nnot,\u201d F. Schauer & B. Spellman, Analogy, Expertise, and\nExperience, 84 U. Chi. L.\u00a0Rev. 249, 254 (2017). For instance,\na green truck and a green hat are relevantly similar if one\u2019s\nmetric is \u201cthings that are green.\u201d Seeibid.They are not\nrelevantly similar if the applicable metric is \u201cthings you can\nwear.\u201dWhile we do not now provide an exhaustive survey\nof the features that render regulations relevantly similar under\nthe Second Amendment, we do think thatHellerandMcDonaldpoint toward at least two metrics: how and why the\nregulations burden a law-abiding citizen\u2019s right to armed\nself-defense. As we stated inHellerand repeated inMcDonald, \u201cindividual self-defense is \u2018thecentral\ncomponent\u2019 of the Second Amendment right.\u201dMcDonald, 561\nU.\u00a0S., at 767 (quotingHeller, 554 U.\u00a0S., at 599);\nsee alsoid.,at 628 (\u201cthe inherent right of self-defense\nhas been central to the Second Amendment right\u201d). Therefore,\nwhether modern and historical regulations impose a comparable\nburden on the right of armed self-defense and whether that burden\nis comparably justified are \u201c\u00a0\u2018central\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nconsiderations when engaging in an analogical inquiry.McDonald, 561 U.\u00a0S., at 767 (quotingHeller, 554\nU.\u00a0S., at 599).[7]To be clear, analogical reasoning under the\nSecond Amendment is neither a regulatory straightjacket nor a\nregulatory blank check. On the one hand, courts should not \u201cuphold\nevery modern law that remotely resembles a historical analogue,\u201d\nbecause doing so \u201crisk[s] endorsing outliers that our ancestors\nwould never have accepted.\u201dDrummondv.Robinson, 9\nF. 4th 217, 226 (CA3 2021). On the other hand, analogical reasoning\nrequires only that the government identify a well-established and\nrepresentative historicalanalogue, not a historicaltwin. So even if a modern-day regulation is not a dead\nringer for historical precursors, it still may be analogous enough\nto pass constitutional muster.Consider, for example,Heller\u2019s\ndiscussion of \u201clongstanding\u201d \u201claws forbidding the carrying of\nfirearms in sensitive places such as schools and government\nbuildings.\u201d 554 U.\u00a0S.,at 626. Although the historical\nrecord yields relatively few 18th- and 19th-century \u201csensitive\nplaces\u201d where weapons were altogether prohibited\u2014e.g.,legislative assemblies, polling places, and courthouses\u2014we are also\naware of no disputes regarding the lawfulness of such prohibitions.\nSee D. Kopel & J. Greenlee, The \u201cSensitive Places\u201d Doctrine, 13\nCharleston L.\u00a0Rev. 205, 229\u2013236, 244\u2013247 (2018); see also\nBrief for Independent Institute asAmicus Curiae11\u201317. We\ntherefore can assume it settled that these locations were\n\u201csensitive places\u201d where arms carrying could be prohibited\nconsistent with the Second Amendment. And courts can use analogies\nto those historical regulations of \u201csensitive places\u201d to determine\nthat modern regulations prohibiting the carry of firearms innewand analogous sensitive places are constitutionally\npermissible.Although we have no occasion to comprehensively\ndefine \u201csensitive places\u201d in this case, we do think respondents err\nin their attempt to characterize New York\u2019s proper-cause\nrequirement as a \u201csensitive-place\u201d law. In their view, \u201csensitive\nplaces\u201d where the government may lawfully disarm law-abiding\ncitizens include all \u201cplaces where people typically congregate and\nwhere law-enforcement and other public-safety professionals are\npresumptively available.\u201d Brief for Respondents 34. It is true that\npeople sometimes congregate in \u201csensitive places,\u201d and it is\nlikewise true that law enforcement professionals are usually\npresumptively available in those locations. But expanding the\ncategory of \u201csensitive places\u201d simply to all places of public\ncongregation that are not isolated from law enforcement defines the\ncategory of \u201csensitive places\u201d far too broadly. Respondents\u2019\nargument would in effect exempt cities from the Second Amendment\nand would eviscerate the general right to publicly carry arms for\nself-defense that we discuss in detail below. See Part III\u2013B,infra. Put simply, there is no historical basis for New York\nto effectively declare the island of Manhattan a \u201csensitive place\u201d\nsimply because it is crowded and protected generally by the New\nYork City Police Department.LikeHeller, we \u201cdo not undertake an\nexhaustive historical analysis .\u00a0.\u00a0. of the full scope of\nthe Second Amendment.\u201d 554 U.\u00a0S., at 626. And we acknowledge\nthat \u201capplying constitutional principles to novel modern conditions\ncan be difficult and leave close questions at the margins.\u201dHellerv.District of Columbia, 670 F.3d 1244, 1275\n(CADC 2011) (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting). \u201cBut that is hardly unique\nto the Second Amendment. It is an essential component of judicial\ndecisionmaking under our enduring Constitution.\u201dIbid.We\nsee no reason why judges frequently tasked with answering these\nkinds of historical, analogical questions cannot do the same for\nSecond Amendment claims.IIIHaving made the constitutional standard\nendorsed inHellermore explicit, we now apply that standard\nto New York\u2019s proper-cause requirement.AIt is undisputed that petitioners Koch and\nNash\u2014two ordinary, law-abiding, adult citizens\u2014are part of \u201cthe\npeople\u201d whom the Second Amendment protects. SeeHeller, 554\nU.\u00a0S., at 580. Nor does any party dispute that handguns are\nweapons \u201cin common use\u201d today for self-defense. Seeid., at\n627; see alsoCaetano, 577 U.\u00a0S., at 411\u2013412. We\ntherefore turn to whether the plain text of the Second Amendment\nprotects Koch\u2019s and Nash\u2019s proposed course of conduct\u2014carrying\nhandguns publicly for self-defense.We have little difficulty concluding that it\ndoes. Respondents do not dispute this. See Brief for Respondents\n19. Nor could they. Nothing in the Second Amendment\u2019s text draws a\nhome/public distinction with respect to the right to keep and bear\narms. As we explained inHeller, the \u201ctextual elements\u201d of\nthe Second Amendment\u2019s operative clause\u2014 \u201cthe right of the people\nto keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed\u201d\u2014\u201cguarantee the\nindividual right to possess and carry weapons in case of\nconfrontation.\u201d 554 U.\u00a0S., at 592.Hellerfurther\nconfirmed that the right to \u201cbear arms\u201d refers to the right to\n\u201cwear, bear, or carry .\u00a0.\u00a0. upon the person or in the\nclothing or in a pocket, for the purpose .\u00a0.\u00a0. of being\narmed and ready for offensive or defensive action in a case of\nconflict with another person.\u201dId., at 584 (quotingMuscarellov.United States,524\nU.S. 125, 143 (1998) (Ginsburg, J., dissenting); internal\nquotation marks omitted).This definition of \u201cbear\u201d naturally encompasses\npublic carry. Most gun owners do not wear a holstered pistol at\ntheir hip in their bedroom or while sitting at the dinner table.\nAlthough individuals often \u201ckeep\u201d firearms in their home, at the\nready for self-defense, most do not \u201cbear\u201d (i.e., carry)\nthem in the home beyond moments of actual confrontation. To confine\nthe right to \u201cbear\u201d arms to the home would nullify half of the\nSecond Amendment\u2019s operative protections.Moreover, confining the right to \u201cbear\u201d arms to\nthe home would make little sense given that self-defense is \u201cthecentral componentof the [ Second Amendment] right itself.\u201dHeller, 554 U.\u00a0S., at 599; see alsoMcDonald,\n561 U.\u00a0S., at 767. After all, the Second Amendment guarantees\nan \u201cindividual right to possess and carry weapons in case of\nconfrontation,\u201dHeller, 554 U.\u00a0S., at 592, and\nconfrontation can surely take place outside the home.Although we remarked inHellerthat the\nneed for armed self-defense is perhaps \u201cmost acute\u201d in the home,id., at 628, we did not suggest that the need was\ninsignificant elsewhere. Many Americans hazard greater danger\noutside the home than in it. SeeMoorev.Madigan,\n702 F.3d 933, 937 (CA7 2012) (\u201c[A] Chicagoan is a good deal more\nlikely to be attacked on a sidewalk in a rough neighborhood than in\nhis apartment on the 35th floor of the Park Tower\u201d). The text of\nthe Second Amendment reflects that reality.The Second Amendment\u2019s plain text thus\npresumptively guarantees petitioners Koch and Nash a right to\n\u201cbear\u201d arms in public for self-defense.BConceding that the Second Amendment guarantees\na general right to public carry, contra,Young, 992\nF.\u00a03d, at 813, respondents instead claim that the Amendment\n\u201cpermits a State to condition handgun carrying in areas \u2018frequented\nby the general public\u2019 on a showing of a non- speculative need for\narmed self-defense in those areas,\u201d Brief for Respondents 19\n(citation omitted).[8] To\nsupport that claim, the burden falls on respondents to show that\nNew York\u2019s proper-cause requirement is consistent with this\nNation\u2019s historical tradition of firearm regulation. Only if\nrespondents carry that burden can they show that the pre-existing\nright codified in the Second Amendment, and made applicable to the\nStates through the Fourteenth, does not protect petitioners\u2019\nproposed course of conduct.Respondents appeal to a variety of historical\nsources from the late 1200s to the early 1900s. We categorize these\nperiods as follows: (1) medieval to early modern England;\n(2)\u00a0the American Colonies and the early Republic; (3)\nantebellum America; (4) Reconstruction; and (5) the late-19th and\nearly-20th centuries.We categorize these historical sources because,\nwhen it comes to interpreting the Constitution, not all history is\ncreated equal. \u201cConstitutional rights are enshrined with the scope\nthey were understood to havewhen the people adopted them.\u201dHeller, 554 U.\u00a0S., at 634\u2013635 (emphasis added). The\nSecond Amendment was adopted in 1791; the Fourteenth in 1868.\nHistorical evidence that long predates either date may not\nilluminate the scope of the right if linguistic or legal\nconventions changed in the intervening years. It is one thing for\ncourts to \u201creac[h] back to the 14th century\u201d for English practices\nthat \u201cprevailed up to the \u2018period immediately before and after the\nframing of the Constitution.\u2019\u00a0\u201dSprint Communications\nCo.v.APCC Services,Inc.,554 U.S.\n269, 311 (2008) (Roberts, C.\u00a0J., dissenting). It is quite\nanother to rely on an \u201cancient\u201d practice that had become \u201cobsolete\nin England at the time of the adoption of the Constitution\u201d and\nnever \u201cwas acted upon or accepted in the colonies.\u201dDimickv.Schiedt,293 U.S.\n474, 477 (1935).As with historical evidence generally, courts\nmust be careful when assessing evidence concerning English\ncommon-law rights. The common law, of course, developed over time.Associated Gen. Contractors of Cal.,Inc.v.Carpenters,459 U.S.\n519, 533, n.\u00a028 (1983); see alsoRogersv.Tennessee,532 U.S.\n451, 461 (2001). And English common-law practices and\nunderstandings at any given time in history cannot be\nindiscriminately attributed to the Framers of our own Constitution.\nEven \u201cthe words ofMagna Charta\u201d\u2014foundational as they were\nto the rights of America\u2019s forefathers\u2014\u201cstood for very different\nthings at the time of the separation of the American Colonies from\nwhat they represented originally\u201d in 1215.Hurtadov.California,110 U.S.\n516, 529 (1884). Sometimes, in interpreting our own\nConstitution, \u201cit [is] better not to go too far back into antiquity\nfor the best securities of our liberties,\u201dFunkv.United\nStates,290 U.S.\n371, 382 (1933), unless evidence shows that medieval law\nsurvived to become our Founders\u2019 law. A long, unbroken line of\ncommon-law precedent stretching from Bracton to Blackstone is far\nmore likely to be part of our law than a short-lived, 14th-century\nEnglish practice.Similarly, we must also guard against giving\npostenactment history more weight than it can rightly bear. It is\ntrue that inHellerwe reiterated that evidence of \u201chow the\nSecond Amendment was interpreted from immediately after its\nratification through the end of the 19th century\u201d represented a\n\u201ccritical tool of constitutional interpretation.\u201d 554 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 605.

Nonetheless, we have made clear\nthat individual rights enumerated in the Bill of Rights and made\napplicable against the States through the Fourteenth Amendment have\nthe same scope as against the Federal Government.

And we have generally assumed that the scope\nof the protection applicable to the Federal Government and States\nis pegged to the public understanding of the right when the Bill of\nRights was adopted in 1791. See,e.g.,Crawfordv.Washington,541 U.S.\n36, 42\u201350 (2004) ( Sixth Amendment);Virginiav.Moore,553 U.S.\n164, 168\u2013169 (2008) ( Fourth Amendment);Nevada Comm\u2019n on\nEthicsv.Carrigan,564 U.S.\n117, 122\u2013125 (2011) ( First Amendment).We also acknowledge that there is an ongoing\nscholarly debate on whether courts should primarily rely on the\nprevailing understanding of an individual right when the Fourteenth\nAmendment was ratified in 1868 when defining its scope (as well as\nthe scope of the right against the Federal Government). See,e.g., A.\u00a0Amar, The Bill of Rights: Creation and\nReconstruction xiv, 223, 243 (1998); K. Lash, Re-Speaking the Bill\nof Rights: A New Doctrine of Incorporation (Jan. 15, 2021)\n(manuscript, at 2), https://papers.ssrn\n.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3766917 (\u201cWhen the people adopted\nthe Fourteenth Amendment into existence, they readopted the\noriginal Bill of Rights, and did so in a manner that invested those\noriginal 1791 texts with new 1868 meanings\u201d). We need not address\nthis issue today because, as we explain below, the public\nunderstanding of the right to keep and bear arms in both 1791 and\n1868 was, for all relevant purposes, the same with respect to\npublic carry.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*With these principles in mind, we turn to\nrespondents\u2019 historical evidence. Throughout modern Anglo-American\nhistory, the right to keep and bear arms in public has\ntraditionally been subject to well-defined restrictions governing\nthe intent for which one could carry arms, the manner of carry, or\nthe exceptional circumstances under which one could not carry arms.\nBut apart from a handful of late-19th-century jurisdictions, the\nhistorical record compiled by respondents does not demonstrate a\ntradition of broadly prohibiting the public carry of commonly used\nfirearms for self-defense. Nor is there any such historical\ntradition limiting public carry only to those law-abiding citizens\nwho demonstrate a special need for self-defense.[9] We conclude that respondents have failed\nto meet their burden to identify an American tradition justifying\nNew York\u2019s proper-cause requirement. UnderHeller\u2019s\ntext-and-history standard, the proper-cause requirement is\ntherefore unconstitutional.1Respondents\u2019 substantial reliance on English\nhistory and custom before the founding makes some sense given our\nstatement inHellerthat the Second Amendment \u201ccodified a\nright \u2018inherited from our English ancestors.\u2019\u00a0\u201d 554\nU.\u00a0S., at 599 (quotingRobertsonv.Baldwin,165\nU.S. 275, 281 (1897)); see alsoSmithv.Alabama,124 U.S.\n465, 478 (1888). But this Court has long cautioned that the\nEnglish common law \u201cis not to be taken in all respects to be that\nof America.\u201dVan Nessv.Pacard, 2 Pet. 137, 144\n(1829) (Story, J., for the Court); see alsoWheatonv.Peters, 8 Pet. 591, 659 (1834);Funk, 290 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 384. Thus, \u201c[t]he language of the Constitution cannot be\ninterpreted safely except by reference to the common law and to\nBritish institutionsas they were when the instrument was framed\nand adopted,\u201d not as they existed in the Middle Ages.Ex\u00a0parte Grossman,267 U.S.\n87, 108\u2013109 (1925) (emphasis added); see alsoUnited\nStatesv.Reid, 12 How. 361, 363 (1852).We interpret the English history that\nrespondents and the United States muster in light of these\ninterpretive principles. We find that history ambiguous at best and\nsee little reason to think that the Framers would have thought it\napplicable in the New World. It is not sufficiently probative to\ndefend New York\u2019s proper-cause requirement.To begin, respondents and theiramicipoint to several medieval English regulations from as early as 1285\nthat they say indicate a longstanding tradition of restricting the\npublic carry of firearms. See 13 Edw. 1, 102. The most prominent is\nthe 1328 Statute of Northampton (or Statute), passed shortly after\nEdward II was deposed by force of arms and his son, Edward III,\ntook the throne of a kingdom where \u201ctendency to turmoil and\nrebellion was everywhere apparent throughout the realm.\u201d N.\nTrenholme, The Risings in the English Monastic Towns in 1327, 6 Am.\nHist. Rev. 650, 651 (1901). At the time, \u201c[b]ands of malefactors,\nknights as well as those of lesser degree, harried the country,\ncommitting assaults and murders,\u201d prompted by a more general\n\u201cspirit of insubordination\u201d that led to a \u201cdecay in English\nnational life.\u201d K. Vickers, England in the Later Middle Ages 107\n(1926).The Statute of Northampton was, in part, \u201ca\nproduct of .\u00a0.\u00a0. the acute disorder that still plagued\nEngland.\u201d A. Verduyn, The Politics of Law and Order During the\nEarly Years of Edward III, 108 Eng. Hist. Rev. 842, 850 (1993). It\nprovided that, with some exceptions, Englishmen could not \u201ccome\nbefore the King\u2019s Justices, or other of the King\u2019s Ministers doing\ntheir office, with force and arms, nor bring no force in affray of\nthe peace, nor to go nor ride armed by night nor by day, in Fairs,\nMarkets, nor in the presence of the Justices or other Ministers,\nnor in no part elsewhere, upon pain to forfeit their Armour to the\nKing, and their Bodies to Prison at the King\u2019s pleasure.\u201d 2 Edw. 3\nc. 3 (1328).Respondents argue that the prohibition on\n\u201crid[ing]\u201d or \u201cgo[ing] .\u00a0.\u00a0. armed\u201d was a sweeping\nrestriction on public carry of self-defense weapons that would\nultimately be adopted in Colonial America and justify onerous\npublic-carry regulations. Notwithstanding the ink the parties spill\nover this provision, the Statute of Northampton\u2014at least as it was\nunderstood during the Middle Ages\u2014has little bearing on the Second\nAmendment adopted in 1791. The Statute of Northampton was enacted\nnearly 20 years before the Black Death, more than 200 years before\nthe birth of Shakespeare, more than 350 years before the Salem\nWitch Trials, more than 450 years before the ratification of the\nConstitution, and nearly 550 years before the adoption of the\nFourteenth Amendment.The Statute\u2019s prohibition on going or riding\n\u201carmed\u201d obviously did not contemplate handguns, given they did not\nappear in Europe until about the mid-1500s. See K. Chase, Firearms:\nA Global History to 1700, p.\u00a061 (2003). Rather, it appears to\nhave been centrally concerned with the wearing of armor. See,e.g., Calendar of the Close Rolls, Edward III, 1330\u20131333,\np.\u00a0131 (Apr. 3, 1330) (H. Maxwell-Lyte ed. 1898);id.,\nat 243 (May 28, 1331);id., Edward III, 1327\u20131330, at 314\n(Aug. 29, 1328) (1896). If it did apply beyond armor, it applied to\nsuch weapons as the \u201clauncegay,\u201d a 10- to 12-foot-long lightweight\nlance. See 7 Rich. 2 c. 13 (1383); 20 Rich. 2 c. 1 (1396).The Statute\u2019s apparent focus on armor and,\nperhaps, weapons like launcegays makes sense given that armor and\nlances were generally worn or carried only when one intended to\nengage in lawful combat or\u2014as most early violations of the Statute\nshow\u2014to breach the peace. See,e.g., Calendar of the Close\nRolls, Edward III, 1327\u20131330, at 402 (July 7, 1328);id.,\nEdward III, 1333\u20131337, at 695 (Aug. 18, 1336) (1898). Contrast\nthese arms with daggers. In the medieval period, \u201c[a]lmost everyone\ncarried a knife or a dagger in his belt.\u201d H. Peterson, Daggers and\nFighting Knives of the Western World 12 (2001). While these knives\nwere used by knights in warfare, \u201c[c]ivilians wore them for\nself-protection,\u201d among other things.Ibid.Respondents\npoint to no evidence suggesting the Statute applied to the smaller\nmedieval weapons that strike us as most analogous to modern\nhandguns.When handguns were introduced in England during\nthe Tudor and early Stuart eras, they did prompt royal efforts at\nsuppression. For example, Henry VIII issued several proclamations\ndecrying the proliferation of handguns, and Parliament passed\nseveral statutes restricting their possession. See,e.g., 6\nHen. 8 c. 13, \u00a71 (1514); 25 Hen. 8 c. 17, \u00a71 (1533); 33 Hen. 8 c. 6\n(1541); Prohibiting Use of Handguns and Crossbows (Jan. 1537), in 1\nTudor Royal Proclamations 249 (P. Hughes & J. Larkin eds.\n1964). But Henry VIII\u2019s displeasure with handguns arose not\nprimarily from concerns about their safety but rather their\ninefficacy. Henry VIII worried that handguns threatened\nEnglishmen\u2019s proficiency with the longbow\u2014a weapon many believed\nwas crucial to English military victories in the 1300s and 1400s,\nincluding the legendary English victories at Cr\u00e9cy and Agincourt.\nSee R. Payne-Gallwey, The Crossbow 32, 34 (1903); L. Schwoerer, Gun\nCulture in Early Modern England 54 (2016) (Schwoerer).Similarly, James I considered small\nhandguns\u2014called dags\u2014\u201cutterly unserviceable for defence, Militarie\npractise, or other lawful use.\u201d A Proclamation Against Steelets,\nPocket Daggers, Pocket Dagges and Pistols (R. Barker printer 1616).\nBut, in any event, James I\u2019s proclamation in 1616 \u201cwas the last one\nregarding civilians carrying dags,\u201d Schwoerer 63. \u201cAfter this the\nquestion faded without explanation.\u201dIbid.So, by the time\nEnglishmen began to arrive in America in the early 1600s, the\npublic carry of handguns was no longer widely proscribed.When we look to the latter half of the 17th\ncentury, respondents\u2019 case only weakens. As inHeller, we\nconsider this history \u201c[b]etween the [Stuart] Restoration [in 1660]\nand the Glorious Revolution [in 1688]\u201d to be particularly\ninstructive. 554 U.\u00a0S., at 592. During that time, the Stuart\nKings Charles II and James II ramped up efforts to disarm their\npolitical opponents, an experience that \u201ccaused Englishmen\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. to be jealous of their arms.\u201dId., at\n593.In one notable example, the government charged\nSir John Knight, a prominent detractor of James II, with violating\nthe Statute of Northampton because he allegedly \u201cdid walk about the\nstreets armed with guns, and that he went into the church of St.\nMichael, in Bristol, in the time of divine service, with a gun, to\nterrify the King\u2019s subjects.\u201dSir John Knight\u2019s Case, 3 Mod.\n117, 87 Eng. Rep. 75, 76 (K. B. 1686). Chief Justice Holt explained\nthat the Statute of Northampton had \u201calmost gone indesuetudinem,\u201dRexv.Sir John Knight, 1 Comb.\n38, 38\u201339, 90 Eng. Rep. 330 (K. B. 1686), meaning that the Statute\nhad largely become obsolete through disuse.[10] And the Chief Justice further explained that\nthe act of \u201cgo[ing] armedto terrifythe King\u2019s subjects\u201d\nwas \u201ca great offence at thecommon law\u201d and that the Statute\nof Northampton \u201cis but an affirmance of that law.\u201d 3 Mod., at 118,\n87 Eng. Rep., at 76 (first emphasis added). Thus, one\u2019s conduct\n\u201cwill come within the Act,\u201d\u2014i.e., would terrify the King\u2019s\nsubjects\u2014only \u201cwhere the crime shall appear to be malo animo,\u201d 1\nComb., at 39, 90 Eng. Rep., at 330, with evil intent or malice.\nKnight was ultimately acquitted by the jury.[11]Just three years later, Parliament responded by\nwriting the \u201cpredecessor to our Second Amendment\u201d into the 1689\nEnglish Bill of Rights,Heller, 554 U.\u00a0S., at 593,\nguaranteeing that \u201cProtestants .\u00a0.\u00a0. may have Arms for\ntheir Defence suitable to their Conditions, and as allowed by Law,\u201d\n1 Wm. & Mary c. 2, \u00a77, in 3 Eng. Stat. at Large 417 (1689).\nAlthough this right was initially limited\u2014it was restricted to\nProtestants and held only against the Crown, but not Parliament\u2014it\nrepresented a watershed in English history. Englishmen had \u201cnever\nbefore claimed .\u00a0.\u00a0. the right of the individual to\narms.\u201d Schwoerer 156.[12]\nAnd as that individual right matured, \u201cby the time of the\nfounding,\u201d the right to keep and bear arms was \u201cunderstood to be an\nindividual right protecting against both public and private\nviolence.\u201dHeller, 554 U.\u00a0S., at 594.To be sure, the Statute of Northampton survived\nbothSir John Knight\u2019s Caseand the English Bill of Rights,\nbut it was no obstacle to public carry for self-defense in the\ndecades leading to the founding. Serjeant William Hawkins, in his\nwidely read 1716 treatise, confirmed that \u201cno wearing of Arms is\nwithin the meaning of [the Statute of Northampton], unless it be\naccompanied with such Circumstances as are apt to terrify the\nPeople.\u201d 1 Pleas of the Crown 136. To illustrate that proposition,\nHawkins noted as an example that \u201cPersons of Quality\u201d were \u201cin no\nDanger of Offending against this Statute by wearing common Weapons\u201d\nbecause, in those circumstances, it would be clear that they had no\n\u201cIntention to commit any Act of Violence or Disturbance of the\nPeace.\u201dIbid.; see also T. Barlow, The Justice of Peace 12\n(1745). Respondents do not offer any evidence showing that, in the\nearly 18th century or after, the mere public carrying of a handgun\nwould terrify people. In fact, the opposite seems to have been\ntrue. As time went on, \u201cdomestic gun culture [in England] softened\u201d\nany \u201cterror\u201d that firearms might once have conveyed. Schwoerer 4.\nThus, whatever place handguns had in English society during the\nTudor and Stuart reigns, by the time we reach the 18th century\u2014and\nnear the founding\u2014they had gained a fairly secure footing in\nEnglish culture.At the very least, we cannot conclude from this\nhistorical record that, by the time of the founding, English law\nwould have justified restricting the right to publicly bear arms\nsuited for self-defense only to those who demonstrate some special\nneed for self-protection.2Respondents next point us to the history of\nthe Colonies and early Republic, but there is little evidence of an\nearly American practice of regulating public carry by the general\npublic. This should come as no surprise\u2014English subjects founded\nthe Colonies at about the time England had itself begun to\neliminate restrictions on the ownership and use of handguns.In the colonial era, respondents point to only\nthree restrictions on public carry. For starters, we doubt thatthreecolonial regulations could suffice to show a tradition\nof public-carry regulation. In any event, even looking at these\nlaws on their own terms, we are not convinced that they regulated\npublic carry akin to the New York law before us.Two of the statutes were substantively\nidentical. Colonial Massachusetts and New Hampshire both authorized\njustices of the peace to arrest \u201call Affrayers, Rioters,\nDisturbers, or Breakers of the Peace, and such as shall ride or go\narmed Offensively .\u00a0.\u00a0. by Night or by Day, in Fear or\nAffray of Their Majesties Liege People.\u201d 1692 Mass. Acts and Laws\nno. 6, pp.\u00a011\u201312; see 1699 N.\u00a0H. Acts and Laws ch. 1.\nRespondents and theiramicicontend that being \u201carmed\noffensively\u201d meant bearing any offensive weapons, including\nfirearms. See Brief for Respondents 33. In particular, respondents\u2019amiciargue that \u201c\u00a0\u2018offensive\u2019\u00a0\u201d arms in the 1600s\nand 1700s were what Blackstone and others referred to as\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018dangerous or unusual weapons,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Brief for Professors\nof History and Law asAmici Curiae7 (quoting 4 Blackstone,\nCommentaries, at 148\u2013149), a category that they say included\nfirearms, see alsopost,at 40\u201342 (Breyer, J.,\ndissenting).Respondents, theiramici, and the dissent\nall misunderstand these statutes. Far from banning the carrying of\nany class of firearms, they merely codified the existing common-law\noffense of bearing arms to terrorize the people, as had the Statute\nof Northampton itself. Seesupra, at 34\u201337. For instance,\nthe Massachusetts statute proscribed \u201cgo[ing] armed Offensively\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. in Fear or Affray\u201d of the people, indicating that\nthese laws were modeled after the Statute of Northampton to the\nextent that the statute would have been understood to limit public\ncarryin the late 1600s. Moreover, it makes very little\nsense to read these statutes as banning the public carry of all\nfirearms just a few years after Chief Justice Holt inSir John\nKnight\u2019s Caseindicated that the English common law did not do\nso.Regardless, even if respondents\u2019 reading of\nthese colonial statutes were correct, it would still do little to\nsupport restrictions on the public carry of handgunstoday.\nAt most, respondents can show that colonial legislatures sometimes\nprohibited the carrying of \u201cdangerous and unusual weapons\u201d\u2014a fact\nwe already acknowledged inHeller. See 554 U.\u00a0S., at\n627. Drawing from this historical tradition, we explained there\nthat the Second Amendment protects only the carrying of weapons\nthat are those \u201cin common use at the time,\u201d as opposed to those\nthat \u201care highly unusual in society at large.\u201dIbid.(internal quotation marks omitted). Whatever the likelihood that\nhandguns were considered \u201cdangerous and unusual\u201d during the\ncolonial period, they are indisputably in \u201ccommon use\u201d for\nself-defense today. They are, in fact, \u201cthe quintessential\nself-defense weapon.\u201dId., at 629. Thus, even if these\ncolonial laws prohibited the carrying of handguns because they were\nconsidered \u201cdangerous and unusual weapons\u201d in the 1690s, they\nprovide no justification for laws restricting the public carry of\nweapons that are unquestionably in common use today.The third statute invoked by respondents was\nenacted in East New Jersey in 1686. It prohibited the concealed\ncarry of \u201cpocket pistol[s]\u201d or other \u201cunusual or unlawful weapons,\u201d\nand it further prohibited \u201cplanter[s]\u201d from carrying all pistols\nunless in military service or, if \u201cstrangers,\u201d when traveling\nthrough the Province. An Act Against Wearing Swords, &c., ch.\n9, in Grants, Concessions, and Original Constitutions of the\nProvince of New Jersey 290 (2d ed. 1881) (Grants and Concessions).\nThese restrictions do not meaningfully support respondents. The law\nrestricted only concealed carry, not all public carry, and its\nrestrictions applied only to certain \u201cunusual or unlawful weapons,\u201d\nincluding \u201cpocket pistol[s].\u201dIbid. It also did not apply to\nall pistols, let alone all firearms. \u201cPocket pistols\u201d had barrel\nlengths of perhaps 3 or 4 inches, far smaller than the 6-inch to\n14-inch barrels found on the other belt and hip pistols that were\ncommonly used for lawful purposes in the 1600s. J. George, English\nPistols and Revolvers 16 (1938); see also,e.g., 14 Car. 2\nc. 3, \u00a720 (1662); H.\u00a0Peterson, Arms and Armor in Colonial\nAmerica, 1526\u20131783, p.\u00a0208 (1956) (Peterson). Moreover, the\nlaw prohibited only theconcealedcarry of pocket pistols;\nit presumably did not by its terms touch the open carry of larger,\npresumably more common pistols, except as to \u201cplanters.\u201d[13] In colonial times, a \u201cplanter\u201d\nwas simply a farmer or plantation owner who settled new territory.\nR. Lederer, Colonial American English 175 (1985); New Jersey State\nArchives, J. Klett, Using the Records of the East and West Jersey\nProprietors 31 (rev. ed. 2014),\nhttps://www.nj.gov/state/archives/pdf/proprietors.pdf. While the\nreason behind this singular restriction is not entirely clear,\nplanters may have been targeted because colonial-era East New\nJersey was riven with \u201cstrife and excitement\u201d between planters and\nthe Colony\u2019s proprietors \u201crespecting titles to the soil.\u201d See W.\nWhitehead, East Jersey Under the Proprietary Governments 150\u2013151\n(rev. 2d ed. 1875); see also T. Gordon, The History of New Jersey\n49 (1834).In any event, we cannot put meaningful weight on\nthis solitary statute. First, although the \u201cplanter\u201d restriction\nmay have prohibited the public carry of pistols, it did not\nprohibit planters from carrying long guns for\nself-defense\u2014including the popular musket and carbine. See Peterson\n41. Second, it does not appear that the statute survived for very\nlong. By 1694, East New Jersey provided that no slave \u201cbe permitted\nto carry any gun or pistol .\u00a0.\u00a0. into the woods, or\nplantations\u201d unless their owner accompanied them. Grants and\nConcessions 341. If slave-owning planters were prohibited from\ncarrying pistols, it is hard to comprehend why slaves would have\nbeen able to carry them in the planter\u2019s presence. Moreover, there\nis no evidence that the 1686 statute survived the 1702 merger of\nEast and West New Jersey. See 1 Nevill, Acts of the General\nAssembly of the Province of New-Jersey (1752). At most eight years\nof history in half a Colony roughly a century before the founding\nsheds little light on how to properly interpret the Second\nAmendment.Respondents next direct our attention to three\nlate-18th-century and early-19th-century statutes, but each\nparallels the colonial statutes already discussed. One 1786\nVirginia statute provided that \u201cno man, great nor small, [shall] go\nnor ride armed by night nor by day, in fairs or markets, or in\nother places, in terror of the Country.\u201d Collection of All Such\nActs of the General Assembly of Virginia ch. 21, p.\u00a033\n(1794).[14] A Massachusetts\nstatute from 1795 commanded justices of the peace to arrest \u201call\naffrayers, rioters, disturbers, or breakers of the peace, and such\nas shall ride or go armed offensively, to the fear or terror of the\ngood citizens of this Commonwealth.\u201d 1795 Mass. Acts and Laws ch.\n2, p.\u00a0436, in Laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. And\nan 1801 Tennessee statute likewise required any person who would\n\u201cpublicly ride or go armed to the terror of the people, or\nprivately carry any dirk, large knife, pistol or any other\ndangerous weapon, to the fear or terror of any person\u201d to post a\nsurety; otherwise, his continued violation of the law would be\n\u201cpunished as for a breach of the peace, or riot at common law.\u201d\n1801 Tenn. Acts pp.\u00a0260\u2013261.A by-now-familiar thread runs through these\nthree statutes: They prohibit bearing arms in a way that spreads\n\u201cfear\u201d or \u201cterror\u201d among the people. As we have already explained,\nChief Justice Holt inSir John Knight\u2019s Caseinterpreted\nthisin Terrorem Populielement to require something more\nthan merely carrying a firearm in public. Seesupra, at\n34\u201335. Respondents give us no reason to think that the founding\ngeneration held a different view. Thus, all told, in the century\nleading up to the Second Amendment and in the first decade after\nits adoption, there is no historical basis for concluding that the\npre-existing right enshrined in the Second Amendment permitted\nbroad prohibitions on all forms of public carry.3Only after the ratification of the Second\nAmendment in 1791 did public-carry restrictions proliferate.\nRespondents rely heavily on these restrictions, which generally\nfell into three categories: common-law offenses, statutory\nprohibitions, and \u201csurety\u201d statutes. None of these restrictions\nimposed a substantial burden on public carry analogous to the\nburden created by New York\u2019s restrictive licensing regime.Common-Law Offenses. As during the\ncolonial and founding periods, the common-law offenses of \u201caffray\u201d\nor going armed \u201cto the terror of the people\u201d continued to impose\nsome limits on firearm carry in the antebellum period. But as with\nthe earlier periods, there is no evidence indicating that these\ncommon-law limitations impaired the right of the general population\nto peaceable public carry.For example, the Tennessee attorney general once\ncharged a defendant with the common-law offense of affray, arguing\nthat the man committed the crime when he \u201c\u00a0\u2018arm[ed] himself\nwith dangerous and unusual weapons, in such a manner as will\nnaturally cause terror to the people.\u2019\u00a0\u201dSimpsonv.State, 13 Tenn. 356, 358 (1833). More specifically, the\nindictment charged that Simpson \u201cwith force and arms being arrayed\nin a warlike manner .\u00a0.\u00a0. unlawfully, and to the great\nterror and disturbance of divers good citizens, did make an\naffray.\u201dId., at 361. The Tennessee Supreme Court quashed\nthe indictment, holding that the Statute of Northampton was never\npart of Tennessee law.Id., at 359. But even assuming that\nTennesseans\u2019 ancestors brought with them the common law associated\nwith the Statute, theSimpsoncourt found that if the\nStatute had made, as an \u201cindependent ground of affray,\u201d the mere\narming of oneself with firearms, the Tennessee Constitution\u2019s\nSecond Amendment analogue had \u201ccompletely abrogated it.\u201dId., at 360. At least in light of that constitutional\nguarantee, the court did not think that it could attribute to the\nmere carrying of arms \u201ca necessarily consequent operation as terror\nto the people.\u201dIbid.Perhaps more telling was the North Carolina\nSupreme Court\u2019s decision inStatev.Huntly, 25\nN.\u00a0C. 418 (1843) (per curiam). Unlike the Tennessee\nSupreme Court inSimpson, theHuntlycourt held that\nthe common-law offense codified by the Statute of Northampton was\npart of the State\u2019s law. See 25 N.\u00a0C., at 421\u2013422. However,\nconsistent with the Statute\u2019s long-settled interpretation, the\nNorth Carolina Supreme Court acknowledged \u201cthat the carrying of a\ngun\u201d for a lawful purpose \u201cper\u00a0seconstitutes no\noffence.\u201dId., at 422\u2013423. Only carrying for a \u201cwicked\npurpose\u201d with a \u201cmischievous result .\u00a0.\u00a0. constitute[d a]\ncrime.\u201dId., at 423; see also J. Haywood, The Duty and\nOffice of Justices of Peace 10 (1800); H. Potter, The Office and\nDuties of a Justice of the Peace 39 (1816).[15] Other state courts likewise recognized that\nthe common law did not punish the carrying of deadly weaponsper\u00a0se, but only the carrying of such weapons \u201cfor the\npurpose of an affray, and in such manner as to strike terror to the\npeople.\u201dO\u2019Neilv.State, 16 Ala. 65, 67 (1849).\nTherefore, those who sought to carry firearms publicly and\npeaceably in antebellum America were generally free to do so.Statutory Prohibitions. In the early to\nmid-19th century, some States began enacting laws that proscribed\nthe concealed carry of pistols and other small weapons. As we\nrecognized inHeller, \u201cthe majority of the 19th-century\ncourts to consider the question held that [these] prohibitions on\ncarrying concealed weapons were lawful under the Second Amendment\nor state analogues.\u201d 554 U.\u00a0S., at 626. Respondents\nunsurprisingly cite these statutes[16]\u2014and decisions upholding them[17]\u2014as evidence that States were historically\nfree to ban public carry.In fact, however, the history reveals a\nconsensus that States couldnotban public carry altogether.\nRespondents\u2019 cited opinions agreed that concealed-carry\nprohibitions were constitutional only if they did not similarly\nprohibitopencarry. That was true in Alabama. SeeStatev.Reid, 1 Ala. 612, 616, 619\u2013621\n(1840).[18] It was also true\nin Louisiana. SeeStatev.Chandler, 5 La. 489, 490\n(1850).[19] Kentucky,\nmeanwhile, went one step further\u2014the State Supreme Courtinvalidateda concealed-carry prohibition. SeeBlissv.Commonwealth, 12 Ky. 90 (1822).[20]The Georgia Supreme Court\u2019s decision inNunnv.State, 1 Ga. 243 (1846), is particularly\ninstructive. Georgia\u2019s 1837 statute broadly prohibited \u201cwearing\u201d or\n\u201ccarrying\u201d pistols \u201cas arms of offence or defence,\u201d without\ndistinguishing between concealed and open carry. 1837 Ga. Acts 90,\n\u00a71. To the extent the 1837 Act prohibited \u201ccarrying certain weaponssecretly,\u201d the court explained, it was \u201cvalid.\u201dNunn,\n1 Ga., at 251. But to the extent the Act also prohibited \u201cbearing\narmsopenly,\u201d the court went on, it was \u201cin conflict with\nthe Constitutio[n] andvoid.\u201dIbid.; see alsoHeller, 554 U.\u00a0S., at 612. The Georgia Supreme Court\u2019s\ntreatment of the State\u2019s general prohibition on the public carriage\nof handguns indicates that it was considered beyond the\nconstitutional pale in antebellum America to altogether prohibit\npublic carry.Finally, we agree that Tennessee\u2019s prohibition\non carrying \u201cpublicly or privately\u201d any \u201cbelt or pocket pisto[l],\u201d\n1821 Tenn. Acts ch. 13, p.\u00a015, was, on its face, uniquely\nsevere, seeHeller, 554 U.\u00a0S., at 629. That said, when\nthe Tennessee Supreme Court addressed the constitutionality of a\nsubstantively identical successor provision, see 1870 Tenn. Acts\nch. 13, \u00a71, p.\u00a028, the court read this language to permit the\npublic carry of larger, military-style pistols because any\ncategorical prohibition on their carry would \u201cviolat[e] the\nconstitutional right to keep arms.\u201dAndrewsv.State,\n50 Tenn. 165, 187 (1871); see alsoHeller, 554 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 629 (discussingAndrews).[21]All told, these antebellum state-court decisions\nevince a consensus view that States could not altogether prohibit\nthe public carry of \u201carms\u201d protected by the Second Amendment or\nstate analogues.[22]Surety Statutes. In the mid-19th century,\nmany jurisdictions began adopting surety statutes that required\ncertain individuals to post bond before carrying weapons in public.\nAlthough respondents seize on these laws to justify the\nproper-cause restriction, their reliance on them is misplaced.\nThese laws were notbanson public carry, and they typically\ntargeted only those threatening to do harm.As discussed earlier, Massachusetts had\nprohibited riding or going \u201carmed offensively, to the fear or\nterror of the good citizens of this Commonwealth\u201d since 1795. 1795\nMass. Acts and Laws ch. 2, at 436, in Laws of the Commonwealth of\nMassachusetts. In 1836, Massachusetts enacted a new law\nproviding:\u201cIf any person shall go armed with a dirk,\ndagger, sword, pistol, or other offensive and dangerous weapon,\nwithout reasonable cause to fear an assault or other injury, or\nviolence to his person, or to his family or property, he may, on\ncomplaint of any person having reasonable cause to fear an injury,\nor breach of the peace, be required to find sureties for keeping\nthe peace, for a term not exceeding six months, with the right of\nappealing as before provided.\u201d Mass. Rev. Stat., ch. 134, \u00a716.In short, the Commonwealth required any person\nwho was reasonably likely to \u201cbreach the peace,\u201d and who, standing\naccused, could not prove a special need for self-defense, to post a\nbond before publicly carrying a firearm. Between 1838 and 1871,\nnine other jurisdictions adopted variants of the Massachusetts\nlaw.[23]Contrary to respondents\u2019 position, these\n\u201creasonable-cause laws\u201d in no way represented the \u201cdirect\nprecursor\u201d to the proper-cause requirement. Brief for Respondents\n27. While New York presumes that individuals havenopublic\ncarry right without a showing of heightened need, the surety\nstatutespresumedthat individuals had a right to public\ncarry that could be burdened only if another could make out a\nspecific showing of \u201creasonable cause to fear an injury, or breach\nof the peace.\u201d Mass. Rev. Stat., ch. 134, \u00a716 (1836).[24] As William Rawle explained in an\ninfluential treatise, an individual\u2019s carrying of arms was\n\u201csufficient cause to require him to give surety of the peace\u201d only\nwhen \u201cattended with circumstances giving just reason to fear that\nhe purposes to make an unlawful use of them.\u201d A View of the\nConstitution of the United States of America 126 (2d ed. 1829).\nThen, even on such a showing, the surety laws did notprohibitpublic carry in locations frequented by the general\ncommunity. Rather, an accused arms-bearer \u201ccould go on carrying\nwithout criminal penalty\u201d so long as he \u201cpost[ed] money that would\nbe forfeited if he breached the peace or injured others\u2014a\nrequirement from which he was exempt ifheneeded\nself-defense.\u201dWrenn, 864 F.\u00a03d, at 661.Thus, unlike New York\u2019s regime, a showing of\nspecial need was required onlyafteran individual was\nreasonably accused of intending to injure another or breach the\npeace. And, even then, proving special need simply avoided a fee\nrather than a ban. All told, therefore, \u201c[u]nder surety laws\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. everyone started out with robust carrying rights\u201d\nand only those reasonably accused were required to show a special\nneed in order to avoid posting a bond.Ibid.These\nantebellum special-need requirements \u201cdid not expand carrying for\nthe responsible; it shrank burdens on carrying by the (allegedly)\nreckless.\u201dIbid.One Court of Appeals has nonetheless remarked\nthat these surety laws were \u201ca severe constraint on anyone thinking\nof carrying a weapon in public.\u201dYoung, 992 F.\u00a03d, at\n820. That contention has little support in the historical record.\nRespondents cite no evidence showing the average size of surety\npostings. And given that surety laws were \u201cintended merely for\nprevention\u201d and were \u201cnot meant as any degree of punishment,\u201d 4\nBlackstone, Commentaries, at 249, the burden these surety statutes\nmay have had on the right to public carry was likely too\ninsignificant to shed light on New York\u2019s proper-cause standard\u2014a\nviolation of which can carry a 4-year prison term or a $5,000 fine.\nInHeller, we noted that founding-era laws punishing\nunlawful discharge \u201cwith a small fine and forfeiture of the weapon\n.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0, not with significant criminal penalties,\u201d\nlikely did not \u201cpreven[t] a person in the founding era from using a\ngun to protect himself or his family from violence, or that if he\ndid so the law would be enforced against him.\u201d 554 U.\u00a0S., at\n633\u2013634. Similarly, we have little reason to think that the\nhypothetical possibility of posting a bond would have prevented\nanyone from carrying a firearm for self-defense in the 19th\ncentury.Besides, respondents offer little evidence that\nauthorities ever enforced surety laws. The only recorded case that\nwe know of involved a justice of the peacedecliningto\nrequire a surety, even when the complainant alleged that the\narms-bearer \u201c\u00a0\u2018did threaten to beat, wou[n]d, mai[m], and\nkill\u2019\u00a0\u201d him. Brief for Professor Robert Leider et\u00a0al. asAmici Curiae31 (quotingGroverv.Bullock,\nNo. 185 (Worcester Cty., Aug. 13, 1853)); see E. Ruben & S.\nCornell, Firearm Regionalism and Public Carry: Placing Southern\nAntebellum Case Law in Context, 125 Yale L.\u00a0J. Forum 121, 130,\nn.\u00a053 (2015). And one scholar who canvassed 19th-century\nnewspapers\u2014which routinely reported on local judicial matters\u2014found\nonly a handful of other examples in Massachusetts and the District\nof Columbia, all involving black defendants who may have been\ntargeted for selective or pretextual enforcement. See R. Leider,\nConstitutional Liquidation, Surety Laws, and the Right To Bear Arms\n15\u201317, in New Histories of Gun Rights and Regulation (J. Blocher,\nJ. Charles, & D. Miller eds.) (forthcoming); see also Brief for\nProfessor Robert Leider et\u00a0al. asAmici Curiae31\u201332.\nThat is surely too slender a reed on which to hang a historical\ntradition of restricting the right to public carry.[25]Respondents also argue that surety statutes were\nsevere restrictions on firearms because the \u201creasonable cause to\nfear\u201d standard was essentiallypro\u00a0forma, given that\n\u201cmerely carrying firearms in populous areas breached the peace\u201dper\u00a0se. Brief for Respondents 27. But that is a\ncounterintuitive reading of the language that the surety statutes\nactually used. If the mere carrying of handguns breached the peace,\nit would be odd to draft a surety statute requiring a complainant\nto demonstrate \u201creasonable cause to fear an injury, or breach of\nthe peace,\u201d Mass. Rev. Stat., ch. 134, \u00a716, rather than a\nreasonable likelihood that the arms-bearer carried a covered\nweapon. After all, if it was the nature of the weapon rather than\nthe manner of carry that was dispositive, then the \u201creasonable\nfear\u201d requirement would be redundant.Moreover, the overlapping scope of surety\nstatutes and criminal statutes suggests that the former were not\nviewed as substantial restrictions on public carry. For example,\nwhen Massachusetts enacted its surety statute in 1836, it\nreaffirmed its 1794 criminal prohibition on \u201cgo[ing] armed\noffensively, to the terror of the people.\u201d Mass. Rev. Stat., ch.\n85, \u00a724. And Massachusetts continued to criminalize the carrying of\nvarious \u201cdangerous weapons\u201d well after passing the 1836 surety\nstatute. See,e.g., 1850 Mass. Acts ch. 194, \u00a71,\np.\u00a0401; Mass. Gen. Stat., ch. 164, \u00a710 (1860). Similarly,\nVirginia had criminalized the concealed carry of pistols since\n1838, see 1838 Va. Acts ch. 101, \u00a71, nearly a decade before it\nenacted its surety statute, see 1847 Va. Acts ch. 14, \u00a716. It is\nunlikely that these surety statutes constituted a \u201csevere\u201d\nrestraint on public carry, let alone a restriction tantamount to a\nban, when they were supplemented by direct criminal prohibitions on\nspecific weapons and methods of carry.To summarize: The historical evidence from\nantebellum America does demonstrate thatthe mannerof\npublic carry was subject to reasonable regulation. Under the common\nlaw, individuals could not carry deadly weapons in a manner likely\nto terrorize others. Similarly, although surety statutes did not\ndirectly restrict public carry, they did provide financial\nincentives for responsible arms carrying. Finally, States could\nlawfully eliminate one kind of public carry\u2014concealed carry\u2014so long\nas they left open the option to carry openly.None of these historical limitations on the\nright to bear arms approach New York\u2019s proper-cause requirement\nbecause none operated to prevent law-abiding citizens with ordinary\nself-defense needs from carrying arms in public for that\npurpose.4Evidence from around the adoption of the\nFourteenth Amendment also fails to support respondents\u2019 position.\nFor the most part, respondents and the United States ignore the\n\u201coutpouring of discussion of the [right to keep and bear arms] in\nCongress and in public discourse, as people debated whether and how\nto secure constitutional rights for newly free slaves\u201d after the\nCivil War.Heller, 554 U.\u00a0S., at 614. Of course, we are\nnot obliged to sift the historical materials for evidence to\nsustain New York\u2019s statute. That is respondents\u2019 burden.\nNevertheless, we think a short review of the public discourse\nsurrounding Reconstruction is useful in demonstrating how public\ncarry for self-defense remained a central component of the\nprotection that the Fourteenth Amendment secured for all\ncitizens.A short prologue is in order. Even before the\nCivil War commenced in 1861, this Court indirectly affirmed the\nimportance of the right to keep and bear arms in public. Writing\nfor the Court inDred Scottv.Sandford, 19 How. 393\n(1857), Chief Justice Taney offered what he thought was a parade of\nhorribles that would result from recognizing that free blacks were\ncitizens of the United States. If blacks were citizens, Taney\nfretted, they would be entitled to the privileges and immunities of\ncitizens, including the right \u201cto keep and carry armswherever\nthey went.\u201dId., at 417 (emphasis added). Thus, even\nChief Justice Taney recognized (albeit unenthusiastically in the\ncase of blacks) that public carry was a component of the right to\nkeep and bear arms\u2014a right free blacks were often denied in\nantebellum America.After the Civil War, of course, the exercise of\nthis fundamental right by freed slaves was systematically thwarted.\nThis Court has already recounted some of the Southern abuses\nviolating blacks\u2019 right to keep and bear arms. SeeMcDonald,\n561 U.\u00a0S., at 771 (noting the \u201csystematic efforts\u201d made to\ndisarm blacks);id., at 845\u2013847 (Thomas, J., concurring in\npart and concurring in judgment); see also S. Exec. Doc. No. 43,\n39th Cong., 1st Sess., 8 (1866) (\u201cPistols, old muskets, and\nshotguns were taken away from [freed slaves] as such weapons would\nbe wrested from the hands of lunatics\u201d).In the years before the 39th Congress proposed\nthe Fourteenth Amendment, the Freedmen\u2019s Bureau regularly kept it\nabreast of the dangers to blacks and Union men in the postbellum\nSouth. The reports described how blacks used publicly carried\nweapons to defend themselves and their communities. For example,\nthe Bureau reported that a teacher from a Freedmen\u2019s school in\nMaryland had written to say that, because of attacks on the school,\n\u201c[b]oth the mayor and sheriff have warned the colored people to go\narmed to school, (which they do,)\u201d and that the \u201c[t]he\nsuperintendent of schools came down and brought [the teacher] a\nrevolver\u201d for his protection. Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess.,\n658 (1866); see also H.\u00a0R. Exec. Doc. No. 68, 39th Cong., 2d\nSess., 91 (1867) (noting how, during the New Orleans riots, blacks\nunder attack \u201cdefended themselves .\u00a0.\u00a0. with such pistols\nas they had\u201d).Witnesses before the Joint Committee on\nReconstruction also described the depredations visited on Southern\nblacks, and the efforts they made to defend themselves. One\nVirginia music professor related that when \u201c[t]wo Union men were\nattacked .\u00a0.\u00a0. they drew their revolvers and held their\nassailants at bay.\u201d H.\u00a0R. Rep. No. 30, 39th Cong., 1st Sess.,\npt. 2, p.\u00a0110 (1866). An assistant commissioner to the Bureau\nfrom Alabama similarly reported that men were \u201crobbing and\ndisarming negroes upon the highway,\u201d H.\u00a0R. Exec. Doc. No. 70,\n39th Cong., 1st Sess., 297 (1866), indicating that blacks indeed\ncarried arms publicly for their self- protection, even if not\nalways with success. See also H.\u00a0R. Exec. Doc. No. 329, 40th\nCong., 2d Sess., 41 (1868) (describing a Ku Klux Klan outfit that\nrode \u201cthrough the country .\u00a0.\u00a0. robbing every one they\ncome across of money, pistols, papers, &c.\u201d);id., at 36\n(noting how a black man in Tennessee had been murdered on his way\nto get book subscriptions, with the murderer taking, among other\nthings, the man\u2019s pistol).Blacks had \u201cprocured great numbers of old army\nmuskets and revolvers, particularly in Texas,\u201d and \u201cemployed them\nto protect themselves\u201d with \u201cvigor and audacity.\u201d S.

That same\nday, a Bureau official reported that freedmen in Kentucky and\nTennessee were still constantly under threat: \u201cNo Union man or\nnegro who attempts to take any active part in politics, or the\nimprovement of his race, is safe a single day; and nearly all sleep\nupon their arms at night, and carry concealed weapons during the\nday.\u201d H.\u00a0R. Exec. Doc. No. 329, 40th Cong., 2d Sess., at\n40.Of course, even during Reconstruction the right\nto keep and bear arms had limits. But those limits were consistent\nwith a right of the public to peaceably carry handguns for\nself-defense. For instance, when General D. E.

And no disorderly person, vagrant, or\ndisturber of the peace, shall be allowed to bear arms.\u201d Cong.\nGlobe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., at 908\u2013909; see alsoMcDonald,\n561 U.\u00a0S., at 847\u2013848 (opinion of Thomas, J.).[26] Around the same time, the editors of\nThe Loyal Georgian, a prominent black-owned newspaper, were asked\nby \u201cA Colored Citizen\u201d whether \u201ccolored persons [have] a right to\nown and carry fire arms.\u201d The editors responded that blacks had\n\u201cthesameright to own and carry fire arms thatothercitizens have.\u201d The Loyal Georgian, Feb. 3, 1866, p.\u00a03, col.\n4. And, borrowing language from a Freedmen\u2019s Bureau circular, the\neditors maintained that \u201c[a]ny person, white or black, may be\ndisarmed if convicted of making an improper or dangerous use of\nweapons,\u201d even though \u201cno military or civil officer has the right\nor authority to disarm any class of people, thereby placing them at\nthe mercy of others.\u201dIbid.(quoting Circular No. 5,\nFreedmen\u2019s Bureau, Dec. 22, 1865); see alsoMcDonald, 561\nU.\u00a0S., at 848\u2013849 (opinion of Thomas, J.).[27]As for Reconstruction-era state regulations,\nthere was little innovation over the kinds of public-carry\nrestrictions that had been commonplace in the early 19th century.\nFor instance, South Carolina in 1870 authorized the arrest of \u201call\nwho go armed offensively, to the terror of the people,\u201d 1870\nS.\u00a0C. Acts p.\u00a0403, no. 288, \u00a74, parroting earlier\nstatutes that codified the common-law offense. That same year,\nafter it cleaved from Virginia, West Virginia enacted a surety\nstatute nearly identical to the one it inherited from Virginia. See\nW.\u00a0Va. Code, ch. 153, \u00a78. Also in 1870, Tennessee essentially\nreenacted its 1821 prohibition on the public carry of handguns but,\nas explained above, Tennessee courts interpreted that statute to\nexempt large pistols suitable for military use. Seesupra,\nat 46.Respondents and the United States, however,\ndirect our attention primarily to two late-19th-century cases in\nTexas. In 1871, Texas law forbade anyone from \u201ccarrying on or about\nhis person .\u00a0.\u00a0. any pistol .\u00a0.\u00a0. unless he has\nreasonable grounds for fearing an unlawful attack on his person.\u201d\n1871 Tex. Gen. Laws \u00a71. The Texas Supreme Court upheld that\nrestriction inEnglishv.State, 35 Tex. 473 (1871).\nThe Court reasoned that the Second Amendment, and the State\u2019s\nconstitutional analogue, protected only those arms \u201cas are useful\nand proper to an armed militia,\u201d including holster pistols, but not\nother kinds of handguns.Id., at 474\u2013475. Beyond that\nconstitutional holding, theEnglishcourt further opined\nthat the law was not \u201ccontrary to public policy,\u201did., at\n479, given that it \u201cma[de] all necessary exceptions\u201d allowing\ndeadly weapons to \u201cbe carried as means of self-defense,\u201d and\ntherefore \u201cfully cover[ed] all wants of society,\u201did., at\n477.Four years later, inStatev.Duke, 42 Tex. 455 (1875), the Texas Supreme Court modified\nits analysis. The court reinterpreted Texas\u2019 State Constitution to\nprotect not only military-style weapons but rather all arms \u201cas are\ncommonly kept, according to the customs of the people, and are\nappropriate for open and manly use in self-defense.\u201dId., at\n458. On that understanding, the court recognized that, in addition\nto \u201cholster pistol[s],\u201d the right to bear arms covered the carry of\n\u201csuch pistols at least as are not adapted to being carried\nconcealed.\u201dId., at 458\u2013459. Nonetheless, after expanding\nthe scope of firearms that warranted state constitutional\nprotection,Dukeheld that requiring any pistol-bearer to\nhave \u201c\u00a0\u2018reasonable grounds fearing an unlawful attack on\n[one\u2019s] person\u2019\u00a0\u201d was a \u201clegitimate and highly proper\u201d\nregulation of handgun carriage.Id., at 456, 459\u2013460.Dukethus concluded that the 1871 statute \u201cappear[ed] to\nhave respected the right to carry a pistol openly when needed for\nself-defense.\u201dId., at 459.We acknowledge that the Texas cases support New\nYork\u2019s proper-cause requirement, which one can analogize to Texas\u2019\n\u201creasonable grounds\u201d standard. But the Texas statute, and the\nrationales set forth inEnglishandDuke, are\noutliers. In fact, only one other State, West Virginia, adopted a\nsimilar public-carry statute before 1900. See W. Va. Code, ch. 148,\n\u00a77 (1887). The West Virginia Supreme Court upheld that prohibition,\nreasoning thatnohandguns of any kind were protected by the\nSecond Amendment, a rationale endorsed by no other court during\nthis period. SeeStatev.Workman, 35 W.\u00a0Va.\n367, 371\u2013374, 14 S.E. 9, 11 (1891). The Texas decisions therefore\nprovide little insight into how postbellum courts viewed the right\nto carry protected arms in public.In the end, while we recognize the support that\npostbellum Texas provides for respondents\u2019 view, we will not give\ndisproportionate weight to a single state statute and a pair of\nstate-court decisions. As inHeller, we will not \u201cstake our\ninterpretation of the Second Amendment upon a single law, in effect\nin a single [State], that contradicts the overwhelming weight of\nother evidence regarding the right to keep and bear arms for\ndefense\u201d in public. 554 U.\u00a0S., at 632.5Finally, respondents point to the slight\nuptick in gun regulation during the late-19th century\u2014principally\nin the Western Territories. As we suggested inHeller,\nhowever, late-19th-century evidence cannot provide much insight\ninto the meaning of the Second Amendment when it contradicts\nearlier evidence. Seeid., at 614;supra, at\n28.[28] Here, moreover,\nrespondents\u2019 reliance on late-19th-century laws has several serious\nflaws even beyond their temporal distance from the founding.The vast majority of the statutes that\nrespondents invoke come from the Western Territories. Two\nTerritories prohibited the carry of pistols in towns, cities, and\nvillages, but seemingly permitted the carry of rifles and other\nlong guns everywhere. See 1889 Ariz. Terr. Sess. Laws no. 13, \u00a71,\np.\u00a016; 1869 N.\u00a0M. Laws ch. 32, \u00a7\u00a71\u20132,\np.\u00a072.[29] Two others\nprohibited the carry ofallfirearms in towns, cities, and\nvillages, including long guns. See 1875 Wyo. Terr. Sess. Laws ch.\n52, \u00a71; 1889 Idaho Terr. Gen. Laws \u00a71, p.\u00a023. And one\nTerritory completely prohibited public carry of pistolseverywhere, but allowed the carry of \u201cshot-guns or rifles\u201d\nfor certain purposes. See 1890 Okla. Terr. Stats., Art. 47, \u00a7\u00a71\u20132,\n5, p.\u00a0495.These territorial restrictions fail to justify\nNew York\u2019s proper-cause requirement for several reasons. First, the\nbare existence of these localized restrictions cannot overcome the\noverwhelming evidence of an otherwise enduring American tradition\npermitting public carry. For starters, \u201c[t]he very transitional and\ntemporary character of the American [territorial] system\u201d often\n\u201cpermitted legislative improvisations which might not have been\ntolerated in a permanent setup.\u201d E. Pomeroy, The Territories and\nthe United States 1861\u20131890, p.\u00a04 (1947). These territorial\n\u201clegislative improvisations,\u201d which conflict with the Nation\u2019s\nearlier approach to firearm regulation, are most unlikely to\nreflect \u201cthe origins and continuing significance of the Second\nAmendment\u201d and we do not consider them \u201cinstructive.\u201dHeller, 554 U.\u00a0S., at 614.The exceptional nature of these western\nrestrictions is all the more apparent when one considers the\nminiscule territorial populations who would have lived under them.\nTo put that point into perspective, one need not look further than\nthe 1890 census. Roughly 62 million people lived in the United\nStates at that time. Arizona, Idaho, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and\nWyoming combined to account for only 420,000 of those\ninhabitants\u2014about two-thirds of 1% of the population. See Dept. of\nInterior, Compendium of the Eleventh Census: 1890, Part\nI.\u2013Population 2 (1892). Put simply, these western restrictions were\nirrelevant to more than 99% of the American population. We have\nalready explained that we will not stake our interpretation of the\nSecond Amendment upon a law in effect in a single State, or a\nsingle city, \u201cthat contradicts the overwhelming weight of other\nevidence regarding the right to keep and bear arms\u201d in public for\nself-defense.Heller, 554 U.\u00a0S., at 632; seesupra,at 57\u201358. Similarly, we will not stake our\ninterpretation on a handful of temporary territorial laws that were\nenacted nearly a century after the Second Amendment\u2019s adoption,\ngoverned less than 1% of the American population, and also\n\u201ccontradic[t] the overwhelming weight\u201d of other, more\ncontemporaneous historical evidence.Heller, 554 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 632.Second, because these territorial laws were\nrarely subject to judicial scrutiny, we do not know the basis of\ntheir perceived legality. When States generally prohibited both\nopen and concealed carry of handguns in the late-19th century,\nstate courts usually upheld the restrictions when they exempted\narmy revolvers, or read the laws to exempt at least that category\nof weapons. See,e.g.,Hailev.State, 38 Ark.\n564, 567 (1882);Wilsonv.State, 33 Ark. 557, 560\n(1878);Fifev.State, 31 Ark. 455, 461 (1876);Statev.Wilburn, 66 Tenn. 57, 60 (1872);Andrews, 50 Tenn., at 187.[30] Those state courts that upheld broader prohibitions\nwithout qualification generally operated under a fundamental\nmisunderstanding of the right to bear arms, as expressed inHeller. For example, the Kansas Supreme Court upheld a\ncomplete ban on public carry enacted by the city of Salina in 1901\nbased on the rationale that the Second Amendment protects only \u201cthe\nright to bear arms as a member of the state militia, or some other\nmilitary organization provided for by law.\u201dSalinav.Blaksley, 72 Kan. 230, 232, 83 P. 619, 620 (1905). That was\nclearly erroneous. SeeHeller, 554 U.\u00a0S., at 592.Absent any evidence explainingwhythese\nunprecedented prohibitions onallpublic carry were\nunderstood to comport with the Second Amendment, we fail to see how\nthey inform \u201cthe origins and continuing significance of the\nAmendment.\u201dId., at 614; see also The Federalist No. 37,\nat\u00a0229 (explaining that the meaning of ambiguous\nconstitutional provisions can be \u201cliquidated and ascertainedby\na series of particular discussions and adjudications\u201d (emphasis\nadded)).Finally, these territorial restrictions deserve\nlittle weight because they were\u2014consistent with the transitory\nnature of territorial government\u2014short lived. Some were held\nunconstitutional shortly after passage. SeeIn\u00a0re\nBrickey, 8 Idaho 597, 70 P. 609 (1902). Others did not survive\na Territory\u2019s admission to the Union as a State. See Wyo. Rev.\nStat., ch. 3, \u00a75051 (1899) (1890 law enacted upon statehood\nprohibiting public carry only when combined with \u201cintent, or avowed\npurpose, of injuring [one\u2019s] fellow-man\u201d). Thus, they appear more\nas passing regulatory efforts by not-yet-mature jurisdictions on\nthe way to statehood, rather than part of an enduring American\ntradition of state regulation.Beyond these Territories, respondents identify\none Western State\u2014Kansas\u2014that instructed cities with more than\n15,000 inhabitants to pass ordinances prohibiting the public carry\nof firearms. See 1881 Kan. Sess. Laws \u00a7\u00a71, 23, pp.\u00a079,\n92.[31] By 1890, the only\ncities meeting the population threshold were Kansas City, Topeka,\nand Wichita. See Compendium of the Eleventh Census: 1890, at\n442\u2013452. Even if each of these three cities enacted prohibitions by\n1890, their combined population (93,000) accounted for only 6.5% of\nKansas\u2019 total population.Ibid.Although other Kansas cities\nmay also have restricted public carry unilaterally,[32] the lone late-19th-century state law\nrespondents identify does not prove that Kansas meaningfully\nrestricted public carry, let alone demonstrate a broad tradition of\nStates doing so.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*At the end of this long journey through the\nAnglo-American history of public carry, we conclude that\nrespondents have not met their burden to identify an American\ntradition justifying the State\u2019s proper-cause requirement. The\nSecond Amendment guaranteed to \u201call Americans\u201d the right to bear\ncommonly used arms in public subject to certain reasonable,\nwell-defined restrictions.Heller, 554 U.\u00a0S., at 581.\nThose restrictions, for example, limited the intent for which one\ncould carry arms, the manner by which one carried arms, or the\nexceptional circumstances under which one could not carry arms,\nsuch as before justices of the peace and other government\nofficials. Apart from a few late-19th-century outlier\njurisdictions, American governments simply have not broadly\nprohibited the public carry of commonly used firearms for personal\ndefense. Nor, subject to a few late-in-time outliers, have American\ngovernments required law-abiding, responsible citizens to\n\u201cdemonstrate a special need for self-protection distinguishable\nfrom that of the general community\u201d in order to carry arms in\npublic.Klenosky, 75 App. Div., at 793, 428\nN.\u00a0Y.\u00a0S. 2d, at 257.IVThe constitutional right to bear arms in\npublic for self-defense is not \u201ca second-class right, subject to an\nentirely different body of rules than the other Bill of Rights\nguarantees.\u201dMcDonald, 561 U.\u00a0S., at 780 (plurality\nopinion). We know of no other constitutional right that an\nindividual may exercise only after demonstrating to government\nofficers some special need. That is not how the First Amendment\nworks when it comes to unpopular speech or the free exercise of\nreligion. It is not how the Sixth Amendment works when it comes to\na defendant\u2019s right to confront the witnesses against him. And it\nis not how the Second Amendment works when it comes to public carry\nfor self-defense.New York\u2019s proper-cause requirement violates the\nFourteenth Amendment in that it prevents law-abiding citizens with\nordinary self-defense needs from exercising their right to keep and\nbear arms. We therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of\nAppeals and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with\nthis opinion.It is so ordered.Notes1See Ala.

Three States\u2014Connecticut, Delaware, and Rhode\nIsland\u2014have discretionary criteria but appear to operate like\n\u201cshall issue\u201d jurisdictions. See Conn. Gen.

Although Connecticut officials have discretion to deny a\nconcealed-carry permit to anyone who is not a \u201csuitable person,\u201d\nsee Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a729\u201328(b), the \u201csuitable person\u201d standard\nprecludes permits only to those \u201cindividuals whose conduct has\nshown them to be lacking the essential character of temperament\nnecessary to be entrusted with a weapon.\u201dDwyerv.Farrell, 193 Conn. 7, 12, 475 A.2d 257, 260 (1984) (internal\nquotation marks omitted). As for Delaware, the State has thus far\nprocessed 5,680 license applications and renewals in fiscal year\n2022 and has denied only 112. See Del. Courts, Super. Ct., Carrying\nConcealed Deadly Weapon (June 9, 2022),\nhttps://courts.delaware.gov/forms/download.aspx?ID=125408.\nMoreover, Delaware appears to have no licensing requirement for\nopen carry. Finally, Rhode Island has a suitability requirement,\nsee R.\u00a0I. Gen. Laws \u00a711\u201347\u201311, but the Rhode Island Supreme\nCourt has flatly denied that the \u201c[d]emonstration of a proper\nshowing of need\u201d is a component of that requirement.Gadomskiv.Tavares, 113 A.3d 387, 392 (2015).\nAdditionally, some \u201cshall issue\u201d jurisdictions have so-called\n\u201cconstitutional carry\u201d protections that allow certain individuals\nto carry handguns in public within the State withoutanypermit whatsoever.

ButHeller\u2019s passing observation\nthat the District\u2019s ban would fail under any heightened \u201cstandar[d]\nof scrutiny\u201d did not supplantHeller\u2019s focus on\nconstitutional text and history. Rather,Heller\u2019s comment\n\u201cwas more of a gilding-the-lily observation about the extreme\nnature of D.C.\u2019s law,\u201dHellerv.District of\nColumbia, 670 F.3d 1244, 1277 (CADC 2011) (Kavanaugh, J.,\ndissenting), than a reflection ofHeller\u2019s methodology or\nholding.6The dissent claims thatHeller\u2019s text-and-history test will prove unworkable\ncompared to means-end scrutiny in part because judges are\nrelatively ill equipped to \u201cresolv[e] difficult historical\nquestions\u201d or engage in \u201csearching historical surveys.\u201dPost, at 26, 30. We are unpersuaded. The job of judges is\nnot to resolve historical questions in the abstract; it is to\nresolvelegalquestions presented in particular cases or\ncontroversies. That \u201clegal inquiry is a refined subset\u201d of a\nbroader \u201chistorical inquiry,\u201d and it relies on \u201cvarious evidentiary\nprinciples and default rules\u201d to resolve uncertainties. W. Baude\n& S. Sachs, Originalism and the Law of the Past, 37 L. &\nHist. Rev. 809, 810\u2013811 (2019). For example, \u201c[i]n our adversarial\nsystem of adjudication, we follow the principle of party\npresentation.\u201dUnited Statesv.Sineneng-Smith, 590\nU.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2020) (slip op., at 3). Courts are thus\nentitled to decide a case based on the historical record compiled\nby the parties.7This does not mean that\ncourts may engage in independent means-end scrutiny under the guise\nof an analogical inquiry. Again, the Second Amendment is the\n\u201cproduct of an interest balancingby the people,\u201d not the\nevolving product of federal judges.Heller, 554 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 635 (emphasis altered). Analogical reasoning requires judges to\napply faithfully the balance struck by the founding generation to\nmodern circumstances, and contrary to the dissent\u2019s assertion,\nthere is nothing \u201c[i]roni[c]\u201d about that undertaking.Post,at 30. It is not an invitation to revise that balance through\nmeans-end scrutiny.8The dissent claims that\nwe cannot answer the question presented without giving respondents\nthe opportunity to develop an evidentiary record fleshing out \u201chow\nNew York\u2019s law is administered in practice, how much discretion\nlicensing officers in New York possess, or whether the proper cause\nstandard differs across counties.\u201dPost,at 20. We disagree.\nThe dissent does not dispute that any applicant for an unrestricted\nconcealed-carry license in New York can satisfy the proper-cause\nstandard only if he has \u201c\u00a0\u2018\u00a0\u201ca special need for\nself-protection distinguishable from that of the general\ncommunity.\u201d\u00a0\u2019\u00a0\u201dPost,at 13 (quotingKachalskyv.County of Westchester, 701 F.3d 81, 86\n(CA2 2012)). And in light of the text of the Second Amendment,\nalong with the Nation\u2019s history of firearm regulation, we conclude\nbelow that a State may not prevent law-abiding citizens from\npublicly carrying handguns because they have not demonstrated a\nspecial need for self-defense. Seeinfra, at 62. That\nconclusion does not depend upon any of the factual questions raised\nby the dissent. Nash and Koch allege that they were denied\nunrestricted licenses because they had not \u201cdemonstrate[d] a\nspecial need for self-defense that distinguished [them] from the\ngeneral public.\u201d App. 123, 125. If those allegations are proven\ntrue, then it simply does not matter whether licensing officers\nhave applied the proper-cause standard differently to other\nconcealed-carry license applicants; Nash\u2019s and Koch\u2019s\nconstitutional rights to bear arms in public for self-defense were\nstill violated.9To be clear, nothing in\nour analysis should be interpreted to suggest the\nunconstitutionality of the 43 States\u2019 \u201cshall-issue\u201d licensing\nregimes, under which \u201ca general desire for self-defense is\nsufficient to obtain a [permit].\u201dDrakev.Filko, 724\nF.3d 426, 442 (CA3 2013) (Hardiman, J., dissenting). Because these\nlicensing regimes do not require applicants to show an atypical\nneed for armed self-defense, they do not necessarily prevent\n\u201claw-abiding, responsible citizens\u201d from exercising their Second\nAmendment right to public carry.District of Columbiav.Heller,554 U.S.\n570, 635 (2008). Rather, it appears that these shall-issue\nregimes, which often require applicants to undergo a background\ncheck or pass a firearms safety course, are designed to ensure only\nthat those bearing arms in the jurisdiction are, in fact,\n\u201claw-abiding, responsible citizens.\u201dIbid.And they likewise\nappear to contain only \u201cnarrow, objective, and definite standards\u201d\nguiding licensing officials,Shuttlesworthv.Birmingham,394 U.S.\n147, 151 (1969), rather than requiring the \u201cappraisal of facts,\nthe exercise of judgment, and the formation of an opinion,\u201dCantwellv.Connecticut,310\nU.S. 296, 305 (1940)\u2014features that typify proper-cause\nstandards like New York\u2019s. That said, because any permitting scheme\ncan be put toward abusive ends, we do not rule out constitutional\nchallenges to shall-issue regimes where, for example, lengthy wait\ntimes in processing license applications or exorbitant fees deny\nordinary citizens their right to public carry.10Another medieval firearm\nrestriction\u2014a 1541 statute enacted under Henry VIII that limited\nthe ownership and use of handguns (which could not be shorter than\na yard) to those subjects with annual property values of at least\n\u00a3100, see 33 Hen. 8 c. 6, \u00a7\u00a71\u20132\u2014fell into a similar obsolescence.\nAs far as we can discern, the last recorded prosecutions under the\n1541 statute occurred in 1693, neither of which appears to have\nbeen successful. SeeKingand Queenv.Bullock, 4 Mod. 147, 87 Eng. Rep. 315 (K. B. 1693);Kingv.Litten, 1 Shower, K. B. 367, 89 Eng. Rep. 644\n(K. B. 1693). It seems that other prosecutions under the 1541\nstatute during the late 1600s were similarly unsuccessful. SeeKingv.Silcot, 3 Mod. 280, 280\u2013281, 87 Eng. Rep. 186\n(K. B. 1690);Kingv.Lewellin, 1 Shower, K. B. 48,\n89 Eng. Rep. 440 (K. B. 1689); cf.King and Queenv.Alsop, 4 Mod. 49, 50\u201351, 87 Eng. Rep. 256, 256\u2013257 (K. B.\n1691). By the late 1700s, it was widely recognized that the 1541\nstatute was \u201cobsolete.\u201d 2 R. Burn, The Justice of the Peace, and\nParish Officer 243, n. (11th ed. 1769); see also,e.g.,The\nFarmer\u2019s Lawyer 143 (1774) (\u201centirely obsolete\u201d); 1 G. Jacob,\nGame-Laws II, Law-Dictionary (T. Tomlins ed. 1797); 2 R. Burn, The\nJustice of the Peace, and Parish Officer 409 (18th ed. 1797)\n(calling the 1541 statute \u201ca matter more of curiosity than use\u201d).\nIn any event, lest one be tempted to put much evidentiary weight on\nthe 1541 statute, it impeded not only public carry, but further\nmade it unlawful for those without sufficient means to \u201ckepe in his\nor their houses\u201d any \u201chandgun.\u201d 33 Hen. 8 c. 6, \u00a71. Of course, this\nkind of limitation is inconsistent withHeller\u2019s historical\nanalysis regarding the Second Amendment\u2019s meaning at the founding\nand thereafter. So, even if a severe restriction on keeping\nfirearms in the home may have seemed appropriate in the mid-1500s,\nit was not incorporated into the Second Amendment\u2019s scope. We see\nlittle reason why the parts of the 1541 statute that address public\ncarry should not be understood similarly. We note also that even\nthis otherwise restrictive 1541 statute, which generally prohibited\nshooting firearms in any city, exempted discharges \u201cfor the defence\nof [one\u2019s] p[er]son or house.\u201d \u00a74. Apparently, the paramount need\nfor self-defense trumped the Crown\u2019s interest in firearm\nsuppression even during the 16th century.11The\ndissent discountsSir John Knight\u2019s Case, 3 Mod. 117, 87\nEng. Rep. 75, because it only \u201carguably\u201d supports the view that an\nevil-intent requirement attached to the Statute of Northampton by\nthe late 1600s and early 1700s. Seepost, at 37. But again,\nbecause the Second Amendment\u2019s bare text covers petitioners\u2019 public\ncarry, the respondents here shoulder the burden of demonstrating\nthat New York\u2019s proper-cause requirement is consistent with the\nSecond Amendment\u2019s text and historical scope. Seesupra,at\n15. To the extent there are multiple plausible interpretations ofSir John Knight\u2019s Case, we will favor the one that is more\nconsistent with the Second Amendment\u2019s command.12Even\nCatholics, who fell beyond the protection of the right to have\narms, and who were stripped of all \u201cArms, Weapons, Gunpowder, [and]\nAmmunition,\u201d were at least allowed to keep \u201csuch necessary Weapons\nas shall be allowed .\u00a0.\u00a0. by Order of the Justices of the\nPeace .\u00a0.\u00a0. for the Defence of his House or Person.\u201d 1\nWm. & Mary c. 15, \u00a74, in 3 Eng. Stat. at Large 399\n(1688).13Even\nassuming that pocket pistols were, as East Jersey in 1686 deemed\nthem, \u201cunusual or unlawful,\u201d it appears that they were commonly\nused at least by the founding. See,e.g., G. Neumann, The\nHistory of Weapons of the American Revolution 150\u2013151 (1967); see\nalso H. Hendrick, P. Paradis, & R. Hornick, Human Factors\nIssues in Handgun Safety and Forensics 44 (2008).14The\nVirginia statute all but codified the existing common law in this\nregard. See G. Webb, The Office and Authority of a Justice of Peace\n92 (1736) (explaining how a constable \u201cmay take away Arms from such\nwho ride, or go, offensively armed, in Terror of the\nPeople\u201d).15The\ndissent concedes thatHuntly, 25 N.\u00a0C. 418, recognized\nthat citizens were \u201c\u00a0\u2018at perfect liberty\u2019\u00a0 to carry for\n\u2018lawful purpose[s].\u2019\u00a0\u201dPost, at 42 (quotingHuntly, 25 N.\u00a0C., at 423). But the dissent disputes\nthat such \u201clawful purpose[s]\u201d included self-defense, becauseHuntlygoes on to speak more specifically of carrying arms\nfor \u201cbusiness or amusement.\u201dId., at 422\u2013423. This is an\nunduly stingy interpretation ofHuntly. In particular,Huntlystated that \u201cthe citizen is at perfect liberty to\ncarry his gun\u201d \u201c[f]oranylawful purpose,\u201d of which\n\u201cbusiness\u201d and \u201camusement\u201d were then mentioned.Ibid.(emphasis added).Huntlythen contrasted these \u201clawful\npurpose[s]\u201d with the \u201cwicked purpose .\u00a0.\u00a0. to terrify and\nalarm.\u201dIbid.Because there is no evidence thatHuntlyconsidered self-defense a \u201cwicked purpose,\u201d we think\nthe best reading ofHuntlywould sanction public carry for\nself-defense, so long as it was not \u201cin such [a] manner as\nnaturally will terrify and alarm.\u201dId., at 423.16Beginning in 1813 with Kentucky, six\nStates (five of which were in the South) enacted laws prohibiting\nthe concealed carry of pistols by 1846. See 1813 Ky. Acts \u00a71,\np.\u00a0100; 1813 La. Acts p.\u00a0172; 1820 Ind. Acts p.\u00a039;\nArk. Rev. Stat. \u00a713, p. 280 (1838); 1838 Va. Acts ch. 101, \u00a71,\np.\u00a076; 1839 Ala. Acts no. 77, \u00a71. During this period, Georgia\nenacted a law that appeared to prohibit both concealed and open\ncarry, see 1837 Ga. Acts \u00a7\u00a71, 4, p.\u00a090, but the Georgia\nSupreme Court later held that the prohibition could not extend to\nopen carry consistent with the Second Amendment. Seeinfra,\nat 45\u201346. Between 1846 and 1859, only one other State, Ohio, joined\nthis group. 1859 Ohio Laws \u00a71, p.\u00a056. Tennessee, meanwhile,\nenacted in 1821 a broader law that prohibited carrying, among other\nthings, \u201cbelt or pocket pistols, either public or private,\u201d except\nwhile traveling. 1821 Tenn. Acts ch. 13, \u00a71, p.\u00a015. And the\nTerritory of Florida prohibited concealed carry during this same\ntimeframe. See 1835 Terr. of Fla. Laws p.\u00a0423.17SeeStatev.Mitchell, 3 Blackf. 229 (Ind. 1833);Statev.Reid, 1 Ala. 612, 616 (1840);Statev.Buzzard, 4 Ark. 18 (1842);Nunnv.State, 1\nGa. 243 (1846);Statev.Chandler, 5 La. 489 (1850);Statev.Smith, 11 La. 633 (1856);Statev.Jumel, 13 La. 399 (1858).

It is a measure of police,\nprohibiting onlya particular modeof bearing arms which is\nfound dangerous to the peace of society\u201d).20With\nrespect to Indiana\u2019s concealed-carry prohibition, the Indiana\nSupreme Court\u2019s reasons for upholding it are unknown because the\ncourt issued a one-sentenceper curiamorder holding the law\n\u201cnot unconstitutional.\u201dMitchell, 3 Blackf., at 229.\nSimilarly, the Arkansas Supreme Court upheld Arkansas\u2019 prohibition,\nbut without reaching a majority rationale. SeeBuzzard, 4\nArk. 18. The Arkansas Supreme Court would later adopt Tennessee\u2019s\napproach, which tolerated the prohibition of all public carry of\nhandguns except for military-style revolvers. See,e.g.,Fifev.State, 31 Ark. 455 (1876).21Shortly afterAndrews, 50\nTenn. 165, Tennessee codified an exception to the State\u2019s handgun\nban for \u201can[y] army pistol, or such as are commonly carried and\nused in the United States Army\u201d so long as they were carried\n\u201copenly in [one\u2019s] hands.\u201d 1871 Tenn. Pub. Acts ch. 90, \u00a71; see\nalsoStatev.Wilburn, 66 Tenn. 57, 61\u201363 (1872);Porterv.State, 66 Tenn. 106, 107\u2013108\n(1874).22The\nTerritory of New Mexico made it a crime in 1860 to carry \u201cany class\nof pistols whatever\u201d \u201cconcealed or otherwise.\u201d 1860 Terr. of\nN.\u00a0M. Laws \u00a7\u00a71\u20132, p.\u00a094. This extreme restriction is an\noutlier statute enacted by a territorial government nearly 70 years\nafter the ratification of the Bill of Rights, and its\nconstitutionality was never tested in court. Its value in\ndiscerning the original meaning of the Second Amendment is\ninsubstantial. Moreover, like many other stringent carry\nrestrictions that were localized in the Western Territories, New\nMexico\u2019s prohibition ended when the Territory entered the Union as\na State in 1911 and guaranteed in its State Constitution that\n\u201c[t]he people have the right to bear arms for their security and\ndefense, but nothing herein shall be held to permit the carrying of\nconcealed weapons.\u201d N.\u00a0M.

Laws p. 432, \u00a76; W.\u00a0Va. Code, ch. 153, \u00a78\n(1868).24It is\ntrue that two of the antebellum surety laws were unusually broad in\nthat they did not expressly require a citizen complaint to trigger\nthe posting of a surety. See 1847 Va. Acts ch. 14, \u00a716; W.\u00a0Va.\nCode, ch. 153, \u00a78 (1868).25The\ndissent speculates that the absence of recorded cases involving\nsurety laws may simply \u201cshow that these laws were normally\nfollowed.\u201dPost,at 45. Perhaps. But again, the burden rests\nwith the government to establish the relevant tradition of\nregulation, seesupra,at 15, and, given all of the other\nfeatures of surety laws that make them poor analogues to New York\u2019s\nproper-cause standard, we consider the barren record of enforcement\nto be simply one additional reason to discount their\nrelevance.26Respondents invoke General Orders No.\n10, which covered the Second Military District (North and South\nCarolina), and provided that \u201c[t]he practice of carrying deadly\nweapons, except by officers and soldiers in the military service of\nthe United States, is prohibited.\u201d Headquarters Second Military\nDist., Gen. Orders No. 10 (Charleston, S.\u00a0C., Apr. 11, 1867),\nin S. Exec. Doc. No. 14, 40th Cong., 1st Sess., 64 (1867). We put\nlittle weight on this categorical restriction given that the order\nalso specified that a violation of this prohibition would \u201crender\nthe offender amenable to trial and punishment by military\ncommission,\u201dibid., rather than a jury otherwise guaranteed\nby the Constitution. There is thus little indication that these\nmilitary dictates were designed to align with the Constitution\u2019s\nusual application during times of peace.27That\nsaid, Southern prohibitions on concealed carry were not always\napplied equally, even when under federal scrutiny. One lieutenant\nposted in Saint Augustine, Florida, remarked how local enforcement\nof concealed-carry laws discriminated against blacks: \u201cTo sentence\na negro to several dollars\u2019 fine for carrying a revolver concealed\nupon his person, is in accordance with an ordinance of the town;\nbut still the question naturally arises in my mind, \u2018Why is this\npoor fellow fined for an offence which is committed hourly by every\nother white man I meet in the streets?\u2019\u00a0\u201d H. R. Exec. Doc. No.\n57, 40th Cong., 2d Sess., 83 (1867); see also H. R. Rep. No. 16,\n39th Cong., 2d Sess., 427 (1867).28We\nwill not address any of the 20th-century historical evidence\nbrought to bear by respondents or theiramici. As with their\nlate-19th-century evidence, the 20th-century evidence presented by\nrespondents and theiramicidoes not provide insight into\nthe meaning of the Second Amendment when it contradicts earlier\nevidence.29The\nNew Mexico restriction allowed an exception for individuals\ncarrying for \u201cthe lawful defence of themselves, their families or\ntheir property, and the same being then and there threatened with\ndanger.\u201d 1869 Terr. of N.\u00a0M. Laws ch. 32, \u00a71, p.\u00a072. The\nArizona law similarly exempted those who have \u201creasonable ground\nfor fearing an unlawful attack upon his person.\u201d 1889 Ariz. Terr.\nSess. Laws no. 13, \u00a72, p.\u00a017.30Many\nother state courts during this period continued the antebellum\ntradition of upholding concealed carry regimes that seemingly\nprovided for open carry. See,e.g.,Statev.Speller, 86 N.\u00a0C. 697 (1882);Chatteauxv.State, 52 Ala. 388 (1875);Eslavav.State, 49\nAla. 355 (1873);Statev.Shelby, 90 Mo. 302, 2 S.W.\n468 (1886);Carrollv.State, 28 Ark. 99 (1872); cf.Robertsonv.Baldwin,165\nU.S. 275, 281\u2013282 (1897) (remarking in dicta that \u201cthe right of\nthe people to keep and bear arms .\u00a0.\u00a0. is not infringed\nby laws prohibiting the carrying of concealed\nweapons\u201d).31In\n1875, Arkansas prohibited the public carry of all pistols. See 1875\nArk. Acts p.\u00a0156, \u00a71. But this categorical prohibition was\nalso short lived.
