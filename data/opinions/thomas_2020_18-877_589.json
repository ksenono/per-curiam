    "text": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES_________________No. 18\u2013877_________________FREDERICK L. ALLEN, et\u00a0al., PETITIONERSv.ROY A. COOPER, III, GOVERNOR OF NORTH CAROLINA,\net\u00a0al.on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the fourth circuit[March 23, 2020]Justice Thomas, concurring in part and\nconcurring in the judgment.I agree with the Court\u2019s conclusion that the\nCopyright Remedy Clarification Act of 1990, 17 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7501et\u00a0seq., does not validly abrogate States\u2019\nsovereign immunity. But I cannot join the Court\u2019s opinion in its\nentirety. I write separately to note two disagreements and one\nquestion that remains open for resolution in a future case.First, although I agree thatFlorida Prepaid\nPostsecondary Ed. Expense Bd.v.College Savings Bank,527 U.S.\n627(1999), is binding precedent, I cannot join the Court\u2019s\ndiscussion ofstare decisis. The Court claims we need\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018special justification[s]\u2019\u00a0\u201d to overrule precedent\nbecause error alone \u201ccannot overcomestare decisis.\u201dAnte, at 9\u201310. That approach \u201cdoes not comport with our\njudicial duty under Article III.\u201dGamblev.United\nStates, 587 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2019) (Thomas, J., concurring)\n(slip op., at 2). If our decision inFlorida Prepaidwere\ndemonstrably erroneous, the Court would be obligated to \u201ccorrect\nthe error, regardless of whether other factors support overruling\nthe precedent.\u201d 587 U.\u00a0S., at ___\u2013___ (same) (slip op., at\n8\u20139).Here, adherence to our precedent is warranted\nbecause petitioners have not demonstrated that our decision inFlorida Prepaid\u201cis incorrect, much less demonstrably\nerroneous.\u201dGamble, 587 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (same) (slip op.,\nat 17). The Court inFlorida Prepaidcorrectly concluded\nthat \u201cCongress may not abrogate state sovereign immunity pursuant\nto its Article I powers,\u201d including its powers under the\nIntellectual Property Clause. 527 U.\u00a0S., at 636 (citingSeminole Tribe of Fla.v.Florida,517 U.S.\n44, 72\u201373 (1996)). Petitioners\u2019 claims to the contrary are\nunpersuasive.[1]*Second, I do not join the Court\u2019s discussion\nregarding future copyright legislation. In my view, we should opine\non \u201conly the case before us in light of the record before us.\u201dManhattan Community Access Corp.v.Halleck, 587\nU.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2019) (slip op., at 15). We should not purport\nto advise Congress on how it might exercise its legislative\nauthority, nor give our blessing to hypothetical statutes or\nlegislative records not at issue here.Finally, I believe the question whether\ncopyrights are property within the original meaning of the\nFourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause remains open. The Court\nrelies onFox Film Corp.v.Doyal,286 U.S.\n123(1932), to conclude that \u201c[c]opyrights are a form of\nproperty.\u201dAnte, at 11. ButFox Film Corp.addressed\n\u201cproperty\u201d in the context of state tax laws, not the Due Process\nClause. 286 U.\u00a0S., at 128. And although we stated inFlorida Prepaidthat patents are \u201cproperty\u201d for due process\npurposes, we did not analyze the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s text, and\nneither of the cases we cited involved due process. 527 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 642 (citingBrownv.Duchesne, 19 How. 183, 197\n(1857);Consolidated Fruit-Jar Co.v.Wright,94 U.S.\n92, 96 (1877)); see also Merrill, The Landscape of\nConstitutional Property, 86 Va. L.\u00a0Rev. 885, 887 (2000)\n(noting that the \u201cCourt has not always been attentive to the\n\u2018property\u2019 threshold\u201d of the Due Process Clauses). Because the\nparties agree that petitioners\u2019 copyrights are property, and\nbecause the Fourteenth Amendment does not authorize this statute\u2019s\nabrogation of state sovereign immunity either way, we need not\nresolve this open question today. I would, however, be willing to\nconsider the matter in an appropriate case.For these reasons, I join all of the Court\u2019s\nopinion except for the final paragraph in Part II\u2013A and the final\nparagraph in Part II\u2013B.Notes1*Because I adhere to our\nprecedents regarding Article I and state sovereign immunity, I\ncontinue to believe thatCentral Va. Community Collegev.Katz,546 U.S.\n356(2006), was wrongly decided. Seeid., at 379\u2013385\n(Thomas, J., dissenting). The Court today rightfully limits that\nde-cision to the Bankruptcy Clause context, calling it a\n\u201cgood-for-one-clause-only holding.\u201dAnte, at 9. I would go a\nstep further and recognize that the Court\u2019s decision inKatzis not good for even that clause.",
