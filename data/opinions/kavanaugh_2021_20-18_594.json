I\njoin the Court\u2019s opinion. I also join Part II of Justice Thomas\u2019s\nconcurrence regarding how the exclusionary rule should apply to hot\npursuit cases.I add this brief concurrence simply to\nunderscore that, in my view, there is almost no daylight in\npractice between the Court\u2019s opinion and The Chief Justice\u2019s\nopinion concurring in the judgment.In his thoughtful opinion, The Chief Justice\nconcludes that pursuit of a fleeing misdemeanant shoulditselfconstitute an exigent circumstance. The Court\ndisagrees. As I see it, however, the difference between The Chief\nJustice\u2019s approach and the Court\u2019s approach will be academic in\nmost cases. That is because cases of fleeing misdemeanants will\nalmost alwaysalsoinvolve a recognized exigent\ncircumstance\u2014such as a risk of escape, destruction of evidence, or\nharm to others\u2014that will still justify warrantless entry into a\nhome. Seeante,at 1, 4, 16; see also,e.g.,City\nand County of San Franciscov.Sheehan, 575 U.S. 600,\n612 (2015);Kentuckyv.King,563\nU.S. 452, 460 (2011);Brigham Cityv.Stuart,547 U.S.\n398, 403 (2006);Minnesotav.Olson,495 U.S.\n91, 100 (1990). As Lange\u2019s able counsel forthrightly\nacknowledged at oral argument, the approach adopted by the Court\ntoday will still allow the police to make a warrantless entry into\na home \u201cnine times out of 10 or more\u201d in cases involving pursuit of\na fleeing misdemeanant. Tr. of Oral Arg. 34.Importantly, moreover, the Court\u2019s opinion does\nnot disturb the long-settled rule that pursuit of a fleeingfelonis itself an exigent circumstance justifying\nwarrantless entry into a home. SeeUnited Statesv.Santana,427 U.S.\n38, 42\u201343 (1976); cf.Stantonv.Sims,571 U.S.\n3, 8, 9 (2013) (per curiam). In other words, the police\nmay make a warrantless entry into the home of a fleeing felon\nregardless of whether other exigent circumstances are present.With those observations, I join the Court\u2019s\nopinion.",
