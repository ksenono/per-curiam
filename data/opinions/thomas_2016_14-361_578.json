This holding further exposes the flaw in\nthis Court\u2019s understanding of extortion. In my view, the Court\nstarted down the wrong path inEvansv.United\nStates, 504 U.\u00a0S. 255 (1992) , which wrongly equated\nextortion with bribery. In so holding,Evansmade it seem\nplausible that an extortionist could conspire with his victim.\nRather than embrace that view, I would not extendEvans\u2019\nerrors further. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.IThe Hobbs Act makes it a crime to \u201cobstruc[t],\ndela[y], or affec[t] commerce .\u00a0.\u00a0. by .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nextortion.\u201d 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71951(a). The Act defines\n\u201cextortion\u201d as \u201cthe obtaining of property from another, with his\nconsent, induced by wrongful use of actual or threatened force,\nviolence, or fear, or under color of official right.\u201d\n\u00a71951(b)(2).InEvans, this Court held that, to obtain\na conviction for extortion \u201cunder color of official right,\u201d the\nGovernment need show only \u201cthat a public official has obtained a\npayment to which he was not entitled, knowing that the payment was\nmade in return for official acts.\u201d 504 U.\u00a0S., at 268. The\nCourt therefore interpreted \u201cextortion\u201d under the Hobbs Act to be\n\u201cthe rough equivalent of .\u00a0.\u00a0. \u2018taking a bribe.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId., at 260.I dissented inEvansbecause the Court\u2019s\nholding disregarded the \u201cdefinite and well-established meaning\u201d of\nthe \u201cunder color of official right\u201d element of extortion.Id.,at 279 (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201c\u00a0\u2018At\ncommon law it was essential that .\u00a0.\u00a0. money or property\nbe obtained under color of office, that is, under the pretense that\nthe officer was entitled thereto by virtue of his office. The money\nor thing received must have been claimed or accepted in right of\noffice, and the person paying must have yielded to official\nauthority.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIbid.(quoting 3 R. Anderson, Wharton\u2019s\nCriminal Law and Procedure \u00a71393,pp. 790\u2013791 (1957); emphasis\ndeleted). When Congress enacted the Hobbs Act in 1946, \u201cthe offense\nwas [thus] understood to involve not merely a wrongful takingby a\npublic official, but a wrongful taking under a false pretense of\nofficial right.\u201d 504 U.\u00a0S.,at 281 (emphasis\ndeleted).Given the established meaning of\nunder-color-of-official-right extortion adopted in the Hobbs Act,\nthe Court inEvanserred in equating common-law extortion\nwith taking a bribe.Id.,at 283. Bribery and extortion are\ndifferent crimes.Ibid.With extortion, \u201cthe public official\nis the sole wrongdoer.\u201dIbid.Because the official \u201cacts\n\u2018under color of office,\u2019 the law regards the payor as an innocent\nvictim and not an accomplice.\u201dIbid.An official who\nsolicits or takes a bribe, by contrast, does not do so \u201cunder color\nof office\u201d\u2014that is, \u201cunder [a] pretense of official entitlement.\u201dIbid.With bribery, \u201cthe payor knows the recipient official\nis not entitled to the payment,\u201d and \u201che, as well as the official,\nmay be punished for the offense.\u201dIbid.(emphasis\ndeleted).IIRelying onEvans\u2019 definition of Hobbs\nAct extortion, seeante,at 2\u20133, 14, the Court holds that an\nextortionist can conspire to commit extortion with the person whom\nhe is extorting.Ante,at 10\u201311, 18. That holding is\nirreconcilable with a correct understanding of Hobbs Act extortion\nand needlessly extendsEvans\u2019 error to the conspiracy\ncontext.The general federal conspiracy statute makes it\na crime for \u201ctwo or more persons [to] conspire . . . to commit any\noffense against the United States.\u201d 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7371. To\nbe guilty of conspiracy to commit under-color-of-official-right\nextortion, then, two or more persons must conspire to \u201cobtai[n]\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. property from another, with his consent, induced\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. under color of official right.\u201d \u00a71951(b)(2).Under a correct understanding of Hobbs Act\nextortion, it is illogical and wrong to say that two people\nconspired to extort one of themselves. As explained, in a Hobbs Act\nextortion case, the only perpetrator is the public official; the\npayor is a victim and not a participant. SeeEvans, 504\nU.\u00a0S., at 283 (Thomas, J., dissenting). That understanding is\nirreconcilable with the view that an extortionist and his\npayor-victim can be co-conspirators to extortion of the payor. If a\npayor conspires with a public official for the payor to pay that\nofficial, then\u2014whatever the two can be said to have done\u2014they have\nnot conspired to obtain payments to that official \u201cunder\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. pretense of official entitlement.\u201dIbid.The\nextortionist and payor both know that the official is not entitled\nto the payments as a matter of his office. They have not conspired\nto commit Hobbs Act extortion.The record confirms that the scheme here did not\ninvolve extortion as the common law understood that crime. Far from\nvictimizing repair-shop owners Alexis Moreno and Edwin Mejia, the\nallegedly extortionate scheme benefited them and their repair shop.\nOver time, 90% or more of the shop\u2019s business came from paid-for\nreferrals from police officers. Moreno and Mejia worked with Ocasio\nand other officers to maximize the shop\u2019s profits from the scheme.\nMoreno and Mejia both pleaded guilty to Hobbs Act extortion and\nconspiracy\u2014belying any claim that they were innocent victims. The\nGovernment itself does not maintain that the repair-shop owners\npaid Ocasio based on his assertion of \u201ca false pretense of official\nright to the payment[s].\u201dId., at 282 (Thomas, J.,\ndissenting). The Government is instead emphatic that Moreno and\nMejia \u201cparticipated as full partners\u201d in the scheme and that \u201c[t]he\nrecord .\u00a0.\u00a0. refutes any suggestion that [they] were the\n\u2018victims\u2019 of th[e] scheme.\u201d Brief for United States 41. Whatever\ncrime Ocasio may have committed, it was not a conspiracy to commit\nextortion.To be sure, the Court\u2019s conclusion is plausible\nunderEvans\u2019 redefinition of extortion. But that is a reason\nnot to extendEvans\u2019 error. Only by blurring the distinction\nbetween bribery and extortion couldEvansmake it seem\nplausible that an extortionist and a victim can conspire to extort\nthe victim. The Court today takes another step away from the\ncommon-law understanding of extortion that the Hobbs Act\nadopted.IIIThe Court\u2019s decision is unfortunate because it\nexpands federal criminal liability in a way that conflicts with\nprinciples of federalism. Even whenEvanswas decided nearly\n25 years ago, the Hobbs Act had already \u201cserved as the engine for a\nstunning expansion of federal criminal jurisdiction into a field\ntraditionally policed by state and local laws\u2014acts of public\ncorruption by state and local officials.\u201d 504 U.\u00a0S., at 290\n(Thomas, J., dissenting). By disregarding the distinction between\nextortion and bribery,Evansexpanded the Hobbs Act to allow\nfederal prosecutors to reach more conduct by state and local\ngovernment officials. Seeid.,at 291\u2013294. That expansion\nwas unwarranted. Congress had not made its intent to regulate state\nofficials \u201cunmistakably clear in the language of the\u201d Hobbs Act,Gregoryv.Ashcroft, 501 U.\u00a0S. 452, 460 (1991)\n(internal quotation marks omitted), so this Court had no basis for\nreading the Hobbs Act so expansively.Evans,supra,\nat 291\u2013292 (Thomas, J., dissenting); seeJonesv.United\nStates, 529 U.\u00a0S. 848, 858 (2000) (\u201c[U]nless Congress\nconveys its purpose clearly, it will not be deemed tohave\nsignificantly changed the federal-state balance inthe prosecution\nof crimes\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).Today the Court again broadens the Hobbs Act\u2019s\nreach to enable federal prosecutors to punish for conspiracy all\nparticipants in a public-official bribery scheme. The invasion of\nstate sovereign functions is again substantial. The Federal\nGovernment can now more expansively charge state and local\nofficials. And it can now more easily obtain pleas or convictions\nfrom these officials: Because the Government can prosecute\nbribe-payors with sweeping conspiracy charges, it will be easier to\ninduce those payors to plead out and testify against state and\nlocal officials. The Court thus further wrenches from States the\npresumptive control that they should have over their own officials\u2019\nwrongdoing.As inEvans, the Court cites no statutory\ntext \u201cclearly\u201d authorizing this intrusion into matters\npresumptively left to the States.Jones,supra,at\n858. As inEvans, there is no need for the Court\u2019s overreach\nbecause state law already punishes the conduct at issue here. See\nMd. Crim. Law Code Ann. \u00a79\u2013201 (2012) (punishing bribery of and\nbribery by a public official); cf.United Statesv.Brock, 501 F.\u00a03d 762, 769 (CA6 2007) (\u201cNo one doubts\nthat the States have criminal laws prohibiting their citizens from\nbribing public officials. [We cannot think of] any reason to doubt\nthe States\u2019 willingness to invoke these laws when their citizens\nengage in [a brazen bribery scheme]\u201d). And, as inEvans, the\nCourt reaches its decision with barely a nod to the sovereignty\ninterests that it tramples. Seeante,at 13\u201314, and\nn.\u00a09 (summarily dismissing as \u201cunavailing\u201d Ocasio\u2019s\n\u201cinvocation of .\u00a0.\u00a0. principles of federalism\u201d). As inEvans, I cannot agree.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*Consistent with the Hobbs Act\u2019s text, I would\nhold that an extortionist cannot conspire to commit extortion with\nthe person whom he is extorting. Accordingly, I would reverse the\nCourt of Appeals\u2019 judgment upholding Ocasio\u2019s conspiracy\nconviction.For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.",
