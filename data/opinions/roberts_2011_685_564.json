S. ____ (2011)SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESNO. 10-235CSX TRANSPORTATION, INC., PETITIONERv.ROBERT McBRIDEon writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the seventh circuit[June 23, 2011]Chief Justice Roberts, with whom\nJustice Scalia, Justice Kennedy, and Justice Alito join,\ndissenting.\u201cIt is a well established\nprinciple of [the common] law, that in all cases of loss we are to\nattribute it to the proximate cause, and not to any remote cause:\ncausa proxima non remota spectatur.\u201dWatersv.Merchants\u2019 Louisville Ins. Co., 11 Pet. 213, 223 (1837)\n(Story, J.). The Court today holds that this principle does not\napply to actions under the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act (FELA),\nand that those suing under that statute may recover for injuries\nthat were not proximately caused by the negligence of their\nemployers. This even though we have held that FELA generally\nfollows the common law, unless the Act expressly provides\notherwise; even though FELA expressly abrogated common law rules in\nfour other respects, but said nothing about proximate cause; and\neven though our own cases, for 50 years after the passage of FELA,\nrepeatedly recognized that proximate cause was required for\nrecovery under that statute.The Court is wrong to dispense with that\nfamiliar element of an action seeking recovery for negligence, an\nele-ment \u201cgenerally thought to be a necessary limitation on\nliability,\u201dExxon Co., U. S. A.v.Sofec, Inc.,517 U. S. 830,\n838 (1996). The test the Court would substitute\u2014whether negligence\nplayed any part, even the slightest, in producing the injury\u2014is no\nlimit at all. It is simply \u201cbut for\u201d causation. Nothing in FELA\nitself, or our decision inRogersv.Missouri Pacific\nR. Co.,352 U. S. 500(1957), supports such a\nboundless theory of liability.I respectfully dissent.I\u201cUnlike a typical workers\u2019\ncompensation scheme, which provides relief without regard to fault,\n\u2026 FELA provides a statutory cause of action sounding in\nnegligence.\u201dNorfolk Southern R.\u00a0Co.v.Sorrell,549 U. S. 158, 165 (2007). When\nCongress creates such a federal tort, \u201cwe start from the premise\u201d\nthat Congress \u201cadopts the background of general tort law.\u201dStaubv.Proctor Hospital, 562 U. S. ___, ___\n(2011) (slip op., at 5). With respect to FELA in particular, we\nhave explained that \u201c[a]bsent express language to the contrary, the\nelements of a FELA claim are determined by reference to the common\nlaw.\u201dSorrell,supra,at 165\u2013166; seeUriev.Thompson,337 U. S. 163, 182\n(1949).Recovery for negligence has\nalways required a showing of proximate cause. \u201c\u00a0\u2018In a\nphilosophical sense, the con-sequences of an act go forward to\neternity.\u2019\u00a0\u201dHolmesv.Securities Investor\nProtection Corporation,503 U. S. 258, 266, n.\n10 (1992) (quoting W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, & D. Owen,\nProsser and Keeton on Law of Torts \u00a741, p. 264 (5th ed. 1984)).\nLaw, however, is not philosophy, and the concept of proximate cause\ndeveloped at common law in response to the perceived need to\ndistinguish \u201cbut for\u201d cause from those more direct causes of injury\nthat can form the basis for liability at law.The plurality breaks no new ground in\ncriticizing the variety of formulations of the concept of proximate\ncause,ante, at 14\u201315; courts, commentators, and\nfirst-year law students have been doing that for generations. SeeExxon,supra,at 838. But it is often easier to\ndisparage the product of centuries of common law than to devise a\nplausible substitute\u2014which may explain why Congress did not\nat-tempt to do so in FELA. Proximate cause is hardly the only\nenduring common law concept that is useful despite its imprecision,\nseeante, at 14. It is in good company with proof beyond a\nreasonable doubt, necessity, willfulness, and unconscionability\u2014to\nname just a few.Proximate cause refers to the basic\nrequirement that before recovery is allowed in tort, there must be\n\u201csome direct relation between the injury asserted and the injurious\nconduct alleged,\u201dHolmes, 503 U. S., at 268. It excludes\nfrom the scope of liability injuries that are \u201ctoo remote,\u201d \u201cpurely\ncontingent,\u201d or \u201cindirect[\u00a0].\u201dId.,at 268, 271, 274.\nRecognizing that liability must not attach to \u201cevery conceivable\nharm that can be traced to alleged wrongdoing,\u201d proximate cause\nrequires a \u201ccausal connection between the wrong and the injury,\u201dAssociated Gen. Contractors of Cal., Inc.v.Carpenters,459 U. S. 519, 536, 533,\nn. 26 (1983), that is not so \u201ctenuous \u2026 that what is claimed to be\nconsequence is only fortuity,\u201dExxon,supra, at\n838 (internal quotation marks omitted). It limits liability at some\npoint before the want of a nail leads to loss of the kingdom. When\nFELA was passed, as now, \u201c[t]he question whether damage in a given\ncase is proximate or remote [was] one of great importance\u2026\u00a0.\n[T]he determination of it determines legal right,\u201d 1 T. Street,\nFoundations of Legal Liability 110 (1906) (reprint 1980).FELA expressly abrogated common law tort\nprinciples in four specific ways. SeeSorrell,supra,at 166, 168;Con-solidated Rail\nCorporationv.Gottshall,512 U. S. 532, 542\u2013543\n(1994). As enacted in 1908, the Act abolished the common law\ncontributory negligence rule, which barred plaintiffs whose\nnegligence had contributed to their injuries from recovering for\nthe negligence of another. See Act of Apr. 22, \u00a73, 35 Stat. 66.\nFELA also abandoned the so-called fellow-servant rule, \u00a71,\nprohibited an assumption of risk defense in certain cases, \u00a74, and\nbarred employees from contractually releasing their employers from\nliability, \u00a75.But \u201c[o]nly to the extent of these explicit\nstatutory alterations is FELA an avowed departure from the rules of\nthe common law.\u201dGottshall, supra,at 544 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). FELA did not abolish the familiar\nrequirement of proximate cause. Because \u201cCongress ex-pressly\ndispensed with [certain] common-law doctrines\u201d in FELA but \u201cdid not\ndeal at all with [other] equally well-established doctrine[s],\u201d I\ndo not believe that \u201cCongress intended to abrogate [the other]\ndoctrine[s]sub silentio.\u201dMonessen Southwestern R.\nCo.v.Morgan,486 U. S. 330, 337\u2013338\n(1988).We have applied the standard requirement of\nproximate cause to actions under federal statutes where the text\ndid not expressly provide for it. SeeDura Pharmaceuticals,\nInc.v.Broudo,544 U. S. 336, 342\u2013346\n(2005) (securities fraud);Holmes,supra, at\n268\u2013270 (Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act);Associated Gen. Contractors of Cal., Inc.,supra,\nat 529\u2013535 (Clayton Act); cf.Metropolitan Edison Co.v.People Against Nuclear Energy,460 U. S. 766, 774\n(1983) (\u201cthe terms \u2018environmental ef-fect\u2019 and \u2018environmental\nimpact\u2019 in [the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 should]\nbe read to include a requirement of a reasonably close causal\nrelationship between a change in the physical environment and the\neffect at issue \u2026\u00a0. like the familiar doctrine of proximate\ncause from tort law\u201d).The Court does not explicitly rest its\nargument on its own reading of FELA\u2019s text. The jury instruction on\ncausation it approves, however, derives from Section 1 of FELA, 45\nU. S.\u00a0C. \u00a751. Seeante, at 1, 16\u201317. But nothing in\nSection 1 is similar to the \u201cexpress language\u201d Congress employed\nelsewhere in FELA when it wanted to abrogate a common law rule,Sorrell,supra,at 165\u2013166. See,e.g.,\u00a753 (\u201cthe fact that the employee may have been guilty of\ncontributory negligence shall not bar a recovery\u201d); \u00a754 (\u201cemployee\nshall not be held to have assumed the risks of his\nemployment\u201d).As the very first section of the statute,\nSection 1 simply outlines who could be sued by whom and for what\ntypes of injuries. It provides that \u201c[e]very common carrier by\nrailroad \u2026 shall be liable in damages to any person suffering\ninjury while he is employed by such carrier \u2026 for such injury or\ndeath resulting in whole or in part from the negligence of any of\nthe officers, agents, or employees of such carrier.\u201d \u00a751. The\nCourt\u2019s theory seems to be that the words \u201cin whole or in part\u201d\nsignal a departure from the historic requirement of proximate\ncause. But those words served a very different purpose. They did\nindeed mark an important departure from a common law principle, but\nit was the principle of contributory negligence\u2014not proximate\ncause.As noted, FELA abolished the defense of\ncontributory negligence; the \u201cin whole or in part\u201d language simply\nre-flected the fact that the railroad would remain liable even if\nits negligence was not the sole cause of injury. SeeSorrell, 549 U. S.,at 170. The Congress that was\nso clear when it was abolishing common law limits on recovery\nelsewhere in FELA did not abrogate the fundamental principle of\nproximate cause in the oblique manner the Court suggests. \u201c[I]f\nCongress had intended such a sea change\u201d in negligence principles\n\u201cit would have said so clearly.\u201dBoard of Trustees of Leland\nStanford Junior Univ.v.Roche Molecular Systems,\nInc., 563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 14).The language the Court adopts as an\ninstruction on causation requires only that negligence have\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018played any part, even the slightest, in producing the\ninjury.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAnte, at 17 (quotingRogers, 352\nU. S., at 506; emphasis deleted); see alsoante,at 18\u201319\n(\u201cJuries in such cases are properly instructed that a defendant\nrailroad \u2018caused or contributed to\u2019 a railroad worker\u2019s injury \u2018if\n[the railroad\u2019s] negligence played a part\u2014no matter how small\u2014in\nbringing about the injury\u2019\u00a0\u201d). If that is proved, \u201cthen the\ncarrier is answerable in damages even if the extent of the [injury]\nor the manner in which it occurred was not \u2018[p]robable\u2019 or\n\u2018foreseeable.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAnte, at 17 (some internal quotation\nmarks omitted). There is nothing in that language that requires\nanything other than \u201cbut for\u201d cause. The terms \u201ceven the slightest\u201d\nand \u201cno matter how small\u201d make clear to juries that even the\nfaintest whisper of \u201cbut for\u201d causation will do.At oral argument, counsel for McBride\nexplained that the correct standard for recovery under FELA is\n\u201cbut-for plus a relaxed form of legal cause.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 44.\nThere is no \u201cplus\u201d in the rule the Court announces today. In this\nvery case defense counsel was free to argue \u201cbut for\u201d cause pure\nand simple to the jury. In closing, counsel informed the jury:\n\u201cWhat we also have to show is defendant\u2019s negligence caused or\ncontributed to [McBride\u2019s] injury. It never would have happenedbut for[CSX] giving him that train.\u201d App. to Pet. for\nCert. 67a (emphasis added).At certain points in its opinion, the Court\nacknowledges that \u201c[i]njuries have countless causes,\u201d not all of\nwhich \u201cshould give rise to legal liability.\u201dAnte, at 5.\nBut the causation test the Court embraces contains no limit on\ncausation at all.IIThis Court, from the time of\nFELA\u2019s enactment, understood FELA to require plaintiffs to prove\nthat an employer\u2019s negligence \u201cis a proximate cause of the\naccident,\u201dDavisv.Wolfe,263 U. S. 239, 243\n(1923). See,e.g.,ibid.(\u201cThe rule clearly\ndeducible from [prior] cases is that \u2026 an employee cannot recover \u2026\nif the [employer\u2019s] failure \u2026 is not a proximate cause of the\naccident \u2026 but merely creates an incidental condition or situation\nin which the accident, otherwise caused, results in such injury\u201d);Carterv.Atlanta & St. Andrews Bay R. Co.,338 U. S. 430,\n435 (1949) (\u201cif the jury determines that the defendant\u2019s breach is\na contributory proximate cause of injury, it may find for the\nplaintiff\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted));O\u2019Donnellv.Elgin, J. & E. R. Co.,338 U. S. 384, 394\n(1949) (\u201cplaintiff was entitled to a[n] \u2026 instruction \u2026 which\nrendered defendant liable for injuries proximately resulting\ntherefrom\u201d).A comprehensive treatise written\nshortly after Congress enacted FELA confirmed that \u201cthe plaintiff\nmust \u2026 show that the alleged negligence was the proximate cause of\nthe damage\u201d in order to recover. 1 M. Roberts, Federal Li-abilities\nof Carriers \u00a7538, p. 942 (1918). As Justice Souter has explained,\nfor the half century after the enactment of FELA, the Court\n\u201cconsistently recognized and applied proximate cause as the proper\nstandard in FELA suits.\u201dSorrell,supra, at 174\n(concurring opinion).No matter. For the Court, time begins in 1957,\nwith our opinion inRogersv.Missouri Pacific R.\nCo.,352 U. S. 500.That opinion, however, \u201cleft this law where it\nwas.\u201dSor-rell,supra,at 174 (Souter, J.,\nconcurring). A jury in that case awarded Rogers damages against his\nrailroad employer, but the Supreme Court of Missouri reversed the\njury verdict. As the Court explains today, we suggested inRogersthat there were \u201ctwo potential readings\u201d of the\nlower court\u2019s opinion and that both were wrong.Ante, at\n7. In doing so, we clarified the consequences of FELA\u2019s elimination\nof the common law contributory negligence rule. We did not do what\nCongress chose not to do, and abrogate the rule of proximate\ncause.First, we rejected the idea \u201cthat [Rogers\u2019s]\nconduct was thesole causeof his mishap.\u201d 352 U. S., at\n504 (emphasis added); contra,Rogersv.Thompson,\n284 S. W. 2d 467, 472 (Mo. 1955) (while \u201c[Rogers] was confronted by\nan emergency[,] \u2026 it was an emergency brought about by himself\u201d).\nThere were, we explained, \u201cprobative facts from which the jury\ncould find that [the railroad] was or should have been aware of\nconditions which created a likelihood that [Rogers] \u2026 would suffer\njust such an injury as he did.\u201d352 U. S., at 503. We\nnoted that \u201c[c]ommon experience teaches both that a passing train\nwill fan the flames of a fire, and that a person suddenly enveloped\nin flames and smoke will instinctively react by retreating from the\ndanger.\u201dIbid.In referring to this predictable sequence\nof events, we described\u2014in familiar terms\u2014sufficient evi-dence of\nproximate cause. We therefore held that the railroad\u2019s negligence\ncould have been a cause of Rogers\u2019s injury regardless of whether\n\u201ctheimmediatereason\u201d why Rogers slipped was the\nrailroad\u2019s negligence in permitting gravel to remain on the surface\nor some other cause.Ibid. (emphasis added).Rogersthereby clarified that, under\na statute in which employer and employee could both be proximate\ncauses of an injury, a railroad\u2019s negligence need not be the sole\nor last cause in order to be proximate. That is an application of\nproximate cause, not a repudiation of it. See Street 111 (\u201ca cause\nmay be sufficiently near in law to the damage to be considered its\neffective legal cause without by any means being the nearest or\nmost proximate to the causes which contribute of the injury\u201d); 1 D.\nDobbs, Law of Torts \u00a7180, p. 445 (2001).We then considered a second interpretation.\nThe Missouri Supreme Court\u2019s opinion could alternatively be read as\nhaving held that Rogers\u2019s \u201cconduct wasat least as probable a\ncausefor his mishap as any negligence of the [railroad],\u201d and\nthat\u2014in those circumstances\u2014\u201cthere was no case for the jury.\u201d 352\nU. S., at 505 (emphasis added). If this was the principle the court\napplied below, it was also wrong and for many of the same\nreasons.Under a comparative negligence scheme in which\nmultiple causes may act concurrently, we clarified that a\nrailroad\u2019s negligence need not be the \u201csole, efficient, produc- ing\ncause of injury,\u201did.,at 506. The question was simply\nwhether \u201cemployer negligence played any part, even the slightest,\nin producing the injury.\u201dIbid.\u201cIt does not matter,\u201d we\ncontinued, \u201cthat, from the evidence, the jury may also with reason,\non grounds of probability, attribute the result to other causes,including the employee\u2019s contributory negligence.\u201dIbid.(emphasis added).The Court today takes the \u201cany part,\neven the slightest\u201d language out of context and views it as a\nrejection of proximate cause. ButRogerswas talking about\ncontributory negligence\u2014it said so\u2014and the language it chose\nconfirms just that. \u201cSlight\u201d negligence was familiar usage in this\ncontext. The statute immediately preceding FELA, passed just two\nyears earlier in 1906, moved part way from contributory to\ncomparative negligence. It provided that \u201cthe fact that the\nemployee may have been guilty of contributory negligence shall not\nbar a recovery where his contrib-utory negligence was slight and\nthat of the employer was gross in comparison.\u201d Act of June 11,\n1906, \u00a72, 34 Stat. 232. Other statutes similarly made this halfway\nstop on the road from contributory to pure comparative negligence,\nagain using the term \u201cslight.\u201d See Dobbs \u00a7201, at 503 (\u201cOne earlier\n[version of comparative fault] \u2026 allowed the negligent plaintiff to\nrecover if the plaintiff\u2019s negligence was slight and the\ndefendant\u2019s gross\u2026\u00a0. Modern comparative negligence law works\ndifferently, reducing the plaintiff\u2019s recovery in proportion to the\nplaintiff\u2019s fault\u201d); V. Schwartz, Comparative Negligence\n\u00a72.01[b][2], p. 33 (5th ed. 2010) (a \u201cmajor form of modified\ncomparative negligence is the \u2018slight-gross\u2019 system\u201d);id.\u00a73.04[b], at 75. In 1908, FELA completed the transition to pure\ncomparative negligence with respect to rail workers. See Dobbs\n\u00a7201, at 503. Under FELA, it does not matter whose negligence was\n\u201cslight\u201d or \u201cgross.\u201d The use of the term \u201ceven the slightest\u201d inRogersmakes perfect sense when the decision is understood\nto be about multiple causes\u2014not about how direct any particular\ncause must be. SeeSorrell, 549 U. S., at 175 (Souter, J.,\nconcurring) (pertinent language concerned \u201cmultiplicity of\ncausations,\u201d not \u201cthe necessary directness of \u2026 causation\u201d).The Court viewsRogersas\n\u201cdescrib[ing] the test for proximate causation\u201d under FELA,ante, at 13 (internal quotation marks omitted), butRogersitself says nothing of the sort. See 352 U. S., at\n506 (describing its test as \u201cthe testof a jury case\u201d\n(emphasis added)).Rogersdid not set forth a novel\nstandard for proximate cause\u2014much less an instruction designed to\nguide jurors in determining causation. Indeed, the trial court inRogersused the term \u201cproximate cause\u201d in its jury\ninstruction and directed the jury to find that Rogers could not\nrecover if his injuries \u201cwere not directly \u2026 caused by\u201d the\nrailroad\u2019s negligence.Id.,at 505, n.\u00a09 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). Our opinion quoted that instruction,ibid., but \u201ctook no issue with [it] in this respect,\u201dSorrell,supra, at 176 (Souter, J.,\nconcurring).A few of our cases have characterizedRogersas hold- ing that \u201ca relaxed standard of causation\napplies under FELA.\u201dGottshall, 512 U. S., at 543; seeCranev.Cedar Rapids & Iowa City R. Co.,395 U. S. 164,\n166 (1969). Fair enough; but these passing summations ofRogersdo not alter its holding. FELA did, of course,\nchange common law rules relating to causation in one respect: Under\nFELA, a railroad\u2019s negligence did not have to be the exclusive\ncause of an injury. SeeGottshall,supra, at\n542\u2013543 (\u201cCongress did away with several common-law tort defenses\n\u2026\u00a0. Specifically, the statute \u2026 rejected the doctrine of\ncontributory negligence in favor of that of comparative\nnegligence\u201d). And, unlike under FELA\u2019s predecessor, the\nproportionate degree of the employee\u2019s negligence would not\nnecessarily bar his recovery. But we have never held\u2014until\ntoday\u2014that FELA entirely eliminates proximate cause as a limit on\nliability.IIIThe Court is correct that the\nfederal courts of appeals have readRogersto support the\nadoption of instructions like the one given here. But we do not\nresolve questions such as the one before us by a show of hands. SeeBuckhannon Board & Care Home, Inc.v.West\nVirginia Dept. of Health and Human Resources,532 U.

Under\nthese circumstances, it seems important to correct an\ninterpretation of our own case law that has run, so to speak, off\nits own rails.Even the Court seems to appreciate that it is\ncreating a troubling gap in the FELA negligence action and ought to\ndosomethingto patch it over. The something it proposes\nis \u201c[r]easonable foreseeability of harm,\u201dante, at 16\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Foreseeability as a test for\nproximate causation would be one thing; foreseeability has, after\nall, long been an aspect of proximate cause. But that is not the\ntest the Court prescribes. It instead limits the foreseeability\ninquiry to whether the defendant was negligent in the first\nplace.The Court observes that juries may be\ninstructed that a defendant\u2019s negligence depends on \u201cwhat a\nreasonably prudent person would anticipate or foresee as creating a\npotential for harm.\u201d 5 L. Sand et\u00a0al., Modern Federal Jury\nInstructions\u2013Civil \u00b689.10, p. 89\u201321 (2010); seeante, at\n16\u201317. That\u2019s all fine and good when a defendant\u2019s negligence\nresults directly in the plaintiff\u2019s injury (nevermind that no\n\u201creasonable foreseeability\u201d instruction was given in this case).\nFor instance, if I drop a piano from a window and it falls on a\nperson, there is no question that I was negligent and could have\nforeseen that the piano would hit someone\u2014as, in fact, it did. The\nproblem for the Court\u2019s test arises when the negligence does not\ndirectly produce the injury to the plaintiff: I drop a piano; it\ncracks the sidewalk; during sidewalk repairs weeks later a man\nbarreling down the sidewalk on a bicycle hits a cone that repairmen\nhave placed around their worksite, and is injured. Was I negligent\nin dropping the piano because I could have foreseen \u201camishap and injury,\u201dante, at 17 (emphasis added; internal\nquotation marks omitted)? Yes. Did my negligence cause\n\u201c[the] mishap and injury\u201d that resulted? It depends on\nwhat is meant by cause. My negligence was a \u201cbut for\u201d cause of the\ninjury: If I had not dropped the piano, the bicyclist would not\nhave crashed. But is it a legal cause? No.In one respect the Court\u2019s test is needlessly\nrigid. If courts must instruct juries on foreseeability as an\naspect of negligence, why not instruct them on foreseeability as an\naspect of causation? And if the jury is simply supposed to intuit\nthat there should also be limits on the legal chain of\ncausation\u2014and that \u201cbut for\u201d cause is not enough\u2014why hide the ball?\nWhy not simply tell the jury? Finally, if the Court intends\n\u201cforeseeability of harm\u201d to be a kind of poorman\u2019s proximate cause,\nthen where does the Court find that requirement in the testRogers\u2014or FELA\u2014pre-scribes? Could it be derived from the\ncommon law?Where does \u201cforeseeability of harm\u201d as the\nsole protection against limitless liability run out of steam? An\nanswer would seem only fair to the common law.A railroad negligently fails to maintain its\nboiler, which overheats. An employee becomes hot while repairing it\nand removes his jacket. When finished with the repairs, he grabs a\nthermos of coffee, which spills on his now-bare arm, burning it.\nWas the risk that someone would be harmed by the failure to\nmaintain the boiler foreseeable? Was the risk that an employee\nwould be burned while repairing the overheated boiler foreseeable?\nCan the railroad be liable under the Court\u2019s test for the coffee\nburn? According to the Court\u2019s opinion, it does not matter that the\n\u201cmanner in which [the injury] occurred was not \u2026 foreseeable,\u201dante, at 17 (internal quotation marks omitted), so long as\nsome negligence\u2014any negligence at all\u2014can be established.The Court\u2019s opinion fails to settle on a\nsingle test for answering these questions: Is it that the\nrailroad\u2019s negligence \u201cpla[y] a part\u2014no matter how small\u2014in\nbringing about the [plaintiff\u2019s] injury,\u201d as the Court indicates on\npages 5, 17 note 13, and 19, or that \u201cnegligence play any part,\neven the slightest, in producing the injury,\u201d as suggested at pages\n8 note 2, 11 note 4, and 17? The Court says there is no difference,\nseeante, at 9, n.\u00a03, but I suspect lawyers\nlitigating FELA cases will prefer one instruction over the other,\ndepending on whether they represent the employer or the employee.\nIn any event, if the Court\u2019s test\u2014whichever version\u2014provides\nanswers to these hypo-theticals, the Court keeps them to\nitself.Proximate cause supplies the vocabulary for\nanswering such questions. It is useful to ask whether the injury\nthat resulted was within the scope of the risk created by the\ndefendant\u2019s negligent act; whether the injury was a natural or\nprobable consequence of the negligence; whether there was a\nsuperseding or intervening cause; whether the negligence was\nanything more than an antecedent event without which the harm would\nnot have occurred.The cases do not provide a mechanical or\nuniform test and have been criticized for that. But they do\n\u201cfurnish illustrations of situations which judicious men upon\ncareful consideration have adjudged to be on one side of the line\nor the other.\u201dExxon, 517 U. S., at 839 (internal\nquotation marks omitted).The Court forswears all these inquiries\nand\u2014with them\u2014an accumulated common law history that might provide\nguidance for courts and juries faced with causation questions. Seeante, at 1 (FELA \u201cdoes not incorporate \u2018proximate cause\u2019\nstandards developed in nonstatutory common-law tort actions\u201d);ante, at 18 (\u201cit is not error in a FELA case to refuse a\ncharge embracing stock proximate cause terminology\u201d). It is not\nnecessary to accept every verbal formulation of proximate cause\never articulated to recognize that these standards provide useful\nguidance\u2014and that juries should receive some instruction\u2014on the\ntype of link required between a railroad\u2019s negligence and an\nemployee\u2019s injury.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*Law has its limits.
