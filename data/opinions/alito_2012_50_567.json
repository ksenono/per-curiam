ILLINOISon writ of certiorari to the supreme court of\nillinois[June 18, 2012]Justice Alito announced the judgment of the\nCourt and delivered an opinion, in which The Chief Justice, Justice\nKennedy, and Justice Breyer join.In this case, we decide whether Crawford v.\nWashington,541 U.S.\n36, 50 (2004) , precludes an expert witness from testifying in\na manner that has long been allowed under the law of evidence.\nSpecifically, does Crawford bar an expert from expressing an\nopinion based on facts about a case that have been made known to\nthe expert but about which the expert is not competent to testify?\nWe also decide whether Crawford substantially impedes the ability\nof prosecutors to introduce DNA evidence and thus may effectively\nrelegate the prosecution in some cases to reliance on older, less\nreliable forms of proof.In petitioner\u2019s bench trial for rape, the\nprosecution called an expert who testified that a DNA profile\nproduced by an outside laboratory, Cellmark, matched a profile\nproduced by the state police lab using a sample of petitioner\u2019s\nblood. On direct examination, the expert testified that Cellmark\nwas an accredited laboratory and that Cellmark provided the police\nwith a DNA profile. The expert also explained the notations on\ndocuments admitted as business records, stating that, according to\nthe records, vaginal swabs taken from the victim were sent to and\nreceived back from Cellmark. The expert made no other statement\nthat was offered for the purpose of identifying the sample of\nbiological material used in deriving the profile or for the purpose\nof establishing how Cellmark handled or tested the sample. Nor did\nthe expert vouch for the accuracy of the profile that Cellmark\nproduced. Nevertheless, petitioner contends that the expert\u2019s\ntestimony violated the Confrontation Clause as interpreted in\nCrawford.Petitioner\u2019s main argument is that the expert\nwent astray when she referred to the DNA profile provided by\nCellmark as having been produced from semen found on the victim\u2019s\nvaginal swabs. But both the Illinois Appellate Court and the\nIllinois Supreme Court found that this statement was not admitted\nfor the truth of the matter asserted, and it is settled that the\nConfrontation Clause does not bar the admission of such statements.\nSee id., at 59\u201360, n. 9 (citing Tennessee v. Street,471\nU.S. 409(1985) ). For more than 200 years, the law of evidence\nhas permitted the sort of testimony that was given by the ex- pert\nin this case. Under settled evidence law, an expert may express an\nopinion that is based on facts that the expert assumes, but does\nnot know, to be true. It is then up to the party who calls the\nexpert to introduce other evidence establishing the facts assumed\nby the expert. While it was once the practice for an expert who\nbased an opinion on assumed facts to testify in the form of an an-\nswer to a hypothetical question, modern practice does not demand\nthis formality and, in appropriate cases, permits an expert to\nexplain the facts on which his or her opinion is based without\ntestifying to the truth of those facts. See Fed. Rule Evid. 703.\nThat is precisely what occurred in this case, and we should not\nlightly \u201cswee[p] away an accepted rule governing the admission of\nscientific evidence.\u201d Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts,557\nU.S. 305, 330 (2009) (Kennedy, J., dissenting).We now conclude that this form of expert\ntestimony does not violate the Confrontation Clause because that\nprovision has no application to out-of-court statements that are\nnot offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. When an\nexpert testifies for the prosecution in a criminal case, the\ndefendant has the opportunity to cross-examine the expert about any\nstatements that are offered for their truth. Out-of-court\nstatements that are related by the expert solely for the purpose of\nexplaining the assumptions on which that opinion rests are not\noffered for their truth and thus fall outside the scope of the\nConfrontation Clause. Applying this rule to the present case, we\nconclude that the expert\u2019s testimony did not violate the Sixth\nAmendment.As a second, independent basis for our decision,\nwe also conclude that even if the report produced by Cellmark had\nbeen admitted into evidence, there would have been no Confrontation\nClause violation. The Cellmark report is very different from the\nsort of extrajudicial statements, such as affidavits, depositions,\nprior testimony, and confessions, that the Confrontation Clause was\noriginally understood to reach. The report was produced before any\nsuspect was identified. The report was sought not for the purpose\nof obtaining evidence to be used against petitioner, who was not\neven under suspicion at the time, but for the purpose of finding a\nrapist who was on the loose. And the profile that Cellmark provided\nwas not inherently inculpatory. On the contrary, a DNA profile is\nevidence that tends to exculpate all but one of the more than 7\nbillion people in the world today. The use of DNA evidence to\nexonerate persons who have been wrongfully accused or convicted is\nwell known. If DNA profiles could not be introduced without calling\nthe technicians who participated in the preparation of the profile,\neconomic pressures would encourage prosecutors to forgo DNA testing\nand rely instead on older forms of evidence, such as eyewitness\nidentification, that are less reliable. See Perry v. New Hampshire,\n565 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2012). The Confrontation Clause does not\nmandate such an undesirable development. This conclusion will not\nprejudice any defendant who really wishes to probe the reliability\nof the DNA testing done in a particular case because those who\nparticipated in the testing may always be subpoenaed by the defense\nand questioned at trial.IAOn February 10, 2000, in Chicago, Illinois, a\nyoung woman, L.\u00a0J., was abducted while she was walking home\nfrom work. The perpetrator forced her into his car and raped her,\nthen robbed her of her money and other personal items and pushed\nher out into the street. L.\u00a0J. ran home and reported the\nattack to her mother, who called the police. An ambulance took\nL.\u00a0J. to the hospital, where doctors treated her wounds and\ntook a blood sample and vaginal swabs for a sexual-assault kit. A\nChicago Police detective collected the kit, labeled it with an\ninventory number, and sent it under seal to the Illinois State\nPolice (ISP) lab.At the ISP lab, a forensic scientist received\nthe sealed kit. He conducted a chemical test that confirmed the\npresence of semen on the vaginal swabs, and he then resealed the\nkit and placed it in a secure evidence freezer.During the period in question, the ISP lab often\nsent biological samples to Cellmark Diagnostics Laboratory in\nGermantown, Maryland, for DNA testing. There was evidence that the\nISP lab sent L.\u00a0J.\u2019s vaginal swabs to Cellmark for testing and\nthat Cellmark sent back a report containing a male DNA profile\nproduced from semen taken from those swabs. At this time,\npetitioner was not under suspicion for L.\u00a0J.\u2019s rape.Sandra Lambatos, a forensic specialist at the\nISP lab, conducted a computer search to see if the Cellmark profile\nmatched any of the entries in the state DNA database. The computer\nshowed a match to a profile produced by the lab from a sample of\npetitioner\u2019s blood that had been taken after he was arrested on\nunrelated charges on August 3, 2000.On April 17, 2001, the police conducted a lineup\nat which L.\u00a0J. identified petitioner as her assailant.\nPetitioner was then indicted for aggravated criminal sexual\nassault, aggravated kidnaping, and aggravated robbery. In lieu of a\njury trial, petitioner chose to be tried before a state judge.BPetitioner\u2019s bench trial began in April 2006.\nIn open court, L.\u00a0J. again identified petitioner as her\nattacker. The State also offered three expert forensic witnesses to\nlink petitioner to the crime through his DNA. First, Brian Hapack,\nan ISP forensic scientist, testified that he had confirmed the\npresence of semen on the vaginal swabs taken from L.\u00a0J. by\nperforming an acid phosphatase test. After performing this test, he\ntestified, he resealed the evidence and left it in a secure freezer\nat the ISP lab.Second, Karen Abbinanti, a state forensic\nanalyst, testified that she had used Polymerase Chain Reaction\n(PCR) and Short Tandem Repeat (STR) techniques to develop a DNA\nprofile from a blood sample that had been drawn from petitioner\nafter he was arrested in August 2000. She also stated that she had\nentered petitioner\u2019s DNA profile into the state forensic\ndatabase.Third, the State offered Sandra Lambatos as an\nexpert witness in forensic biology and forensic DNA analysis. On\ndirect examination, Lambatos testified about the general process of\nusing the PCR and STR techniques to generate DNA profiles from\nforensic samples such as blood and semen. She then described how\nthese DNA profiles could be matched to an individual based on the\nindividual\u2019s unique genetic code. In making a comparison between\ntwo DNA profiles, Lambatos stated, it is a \u201ccommonly accepted\u201d\npractice within the scientific community for \u201cone DNA expert to\nrely on the records of another DNA expert.\u201d App. 51. Lambatos also\ntestified that Cellmark was an \u201caccredited crime lab\u201d and that, in\nher experience, the ISP lab routinely sent evidence samples via\nFederal Express to Cellmark for DNA testing in order to expedite\nthe testing process and to \u201creduce [the lab\u2019s] backlog.\u201d Id., at\n49\u201350. To keep track of evidence samples and preserve the chain of\ncustody, Lambatos stated, she and other analysts relied on sealed\nshipping containers and labeled shipping manifests, and she added\nthat experts in her field regularly relied on such protocols. Id.,\nat 50\u201351.Lambatos was shown shipping manifests that were\nadmitted into evidence as business records, and she explained what\nthey indicated, namely, that the ISP lab had sent L.\u00a0J.\u2019s\nvaginal swabs to Cellmark, and that Cellmark had sent them back,\nalong with a deduced male DNA profile. Id., at 52\u201355. The\nprosecutor asked Lambatos whether there was \u201ca computer match\u201d\nbetween \u201cthe male DNA profile found in semen from the vaginal swabs\nof [L.\u00a0J.]\u201d and \u201c[the] male DNA profile that had been\nidentified\u201d from petitioner\u2019s blood sample. Id., at 55.The defense attorney objected to this question\nfor \u201clack of foundation,\u201d arguing that the prosecution had offered\n\u201cno evidence with regard to any testing that\u2019s been done to\ngenerate a DNA profile by another lab to be testified to by this\nwitness.\u201d Ibid.The prosecutor responded: \u201cI\u2018m not getting at\nwhat another lab did.\u201d Id., at 56. Rather, she said, she was simply\nasking Lambatos about \u201cher own testing based on [DNA] information\u201d\nthat she had received from Cellmark. Ibid. The trial judge agreed,\nnoting, \u201cIf she says she didn\u2019t do her own testing and she relied\non a test of another lab and she\u2019s testifying to that, we will see\nwhat she\u2019s going to say.\u201d Ibid.The prosecutor then proceeded, asking Lambatos,\n\u201cDid you compare the semen that had been identified by Brian Hapack\nfrom the vaginal swabs of [L.\u00a0J.] to the male DNA profile that\nhad been identified by Karen [Abbinanti] from the blood of\n[petitioner]?\u201d Ibid.Lambatos answered \u201cYes.\u201d Ibid. Defense counsel\nlodged an objection \u201cto the form of the question,\u201d but the trial\njudge overruled it. Ibid. Lambatos then testified that, based on\nher own comparison of the two DNA profiles, she \u201cconcluded that\n[petitioner] cannot be excluded as a possible source of the semen\nidentified in the vaginal swabs,\u201d and that the probability of the\nprofile\u2019s appearing in the general population was \u201c1 in 8.7\nquadrillion black, 1 in 390 quadrillion white, or 1 in 109\nquadrillion Hispanic unrelated individuals.\u201d Id., at 57. Asked\nwhether she would \u201ccall this a match to [petitioner],\u201d Lambatos\nanswered yes, again over defense counsel\u2019s objection. Id., at\n58.The Cellmark report itself was neither admitted\ninto evidence nor shown to the factfinder. Lambatos did not quote\nor read from the report; nor did she identify it as the source of\nany of the opinions she expressed.On cross-examination, Lambatos confirmed that\nshe did not conduct or observe any of the testing on the vaginal\nswabs, and that her testimony relied on the DNA profile produced by\nCellmark. Id., at 59. She stated that she trusted Cellmark to do\nreliable work because it was an accredited lab, but she admitted\nshe had not seen any of the calibrations or work that Cellmark had\ndone in deducing a male DNA profile from the vaginal swabs. Id., at\n59\u201362.Asked whether the DNA sample might have been\ndegraded before Cellmark analyzed it, Lambatos answered that, while\ndegradation was technically possible, she strongly doubted it had\noccurred in this case. She gave two reasons. First, the ISP lab\nlikely would have noticed the degradation before sending the\nevidence off to Cell- mark. Second, and more important, Lambatos\nalso noted that the data making up the DNA profile would ex- hibit\ncertain telltale signs if it had been deduced from a degraded\nsample: The visual representation of the DNA sequence would exhibit\n\u201cspecific patterns\u201d of degradation, and she \u201cdidn\u2019t see any\nevidence\u201d of that from looking at the profile that Cellmark\nproduced. Id., at 81\u201382.When Lambatos finished testifying, the defense\nmoved to exclude her testimony \u201cwith regards to testing done by\n[Cellmark]\u201d based on the Confrontation Clause. Id., at 90. Defense\ncounsel argued that there was \u201cno evidence with regards to\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. any work done by [Cellmark] to justify testimony\ncoming into this case with regard to their analysis.\u201d Ibid. Thus,\nwhile defense counsel objected to and sought the exclusion of\nLambatos\u2019 testimony insofar as it implicated events at the Cellmark\nlab, defense counsel did not object to or move for the exclusion of\nany other portion of Lambatos\u2019 testimony, including statements\nregarding the contents of the shipment sent to or received back\nfrom Cellmark. See id., at 55, 56, 90. See also 385 Ill. App. 3d\n359, 367\u2013368, 895 N.E.2d 961, 968 (2008) (chain-of-custody argument\nbased on shipping manifests waived).The prosecution responded that petitioner\u2019s\nConfrontation Clause rights were satisfied because he had the\nopportunity to cross-examine the expert who had testified that\nthere was a match between the DNA profiles produced by Cellmark and\nAbbinanti. App. 91. Invoking Illinois Rule of Evidence 703, [1] the prosecutor argued that\nan expert is allowed to disclose the facts on which the expert\u2019s\nopinion is based even if the expert is not competent to testify to\nthose underlying facts. She further argued that any deficiency in\nthe foundation for the expert\u2019s opinion \u201c[d]oesn\u2019t go to the\nadmissibility of [that] testi- mony,\u201d but instead \u201cgoes to the\nweight of the testimony.\u201d App.\u00a091.The trial judge agreed with the prosecution and\nstated that \u201cthe issue is .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0what weight do you\ngive the test, not do you exclude it.\u201d Id., at 94. Accordingly, the\njudge stated that he would not exclude Lambatos\u2019 testimony, which\nwas \u201cbased on her own independent testing of the data received from\n[Cellmark].\u201d Id., at 94\u201395 (alteration in original).The trial court found petitioner guilty of the\ncharges against him. The state court of appeals affirmed in\nrelevant part, concluding that Lambatos\u2019 testimony did not violate\npetitioner\u2019s confrontation rights because the Cell- mark report was\nnot offered into evidence to prove the truth of the matter it\nasserted. See 385 Ill. App.\u00a03d, at 369, 895\nN.\u00a0E.\u00a02d, at 969\u2013970 (\u201cCellmark\u2019s report was not offered\nfor the truth of the matter asserted; rather, it was offered to\nprovide a basis for Lambatos\u2019 opinion\u201d) The Supreme Court of\nIllinois also affirmed. 238 Ill. 2d 125, 939 N.E.2d 268 (2010).\nUnder state law, the court noted, the Cellmark report could not be\nused as substantive evidence. When Lambatos referenced the report\nduring her direct examination, she did so \u201cfor the limited purpose\nof explaining the basis for [her expert opinion],\u201d not for the\npurpose of showing \u201cthe truth of the matter asserted\u201d by the\nreport. Id., at 150, 939 N.\u00a0E. 2d, at 282. Thus, the report\nwas not used to establish its truth, but only \u201cto show the\nunderlying facts and data Lambatos used before rendering an expert\nopinion.\u201d Id., at 145, 939 N.\u00a0E. 2d, at 279.We granted certiorari. 564 U.\u00a0S. ___\n(2011).IIAThe Confrontation Clause of the Sixth\nAmendment provides that, \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the\naccused shall enjoy the right .\u00a0.\u00a0. to be confronted with\nthe wit- nesses against him.\u201d Before Crawford, this Court took the\nview that the Confrontation Clause did not bar the admission of an\nout-of-court statement that fell within a firmly rooted exception\nto the hearsay rule, see Ohio v. Roberts,448 U.S.\n56, 66 (1980) , but in Crawford, the Court adopted a\nfundamentally new interpretation of the confronta- tion right,\nholding that \u201c[t]estimonial statements of witnesses absent from\ntrial [can be] admitted only where the declarant is unavailable,\nand only where the defendant has had a prior opportunity to\ncross-examine.\u201d 541 U.\u00a0S., at 59. Crawford has resulted in a\nsteady stream of new cases in this Court. See Bullcoming v. New\nMexico, 564 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2011); Michigan v. Bryant, 562\nU.\u00a0S. ___ (2011); Melendez-Diaz,557 U.S.\n305; Giles v. California,554 U.S.\n353(2008) ; Indiana v. Edwards,554 U.S.\n164(2008) ; Davis v. Washington,547\nU.S. 813(2006) .Two of these decisions involved scientific\nreports. In Melendez-Diaz, the defendant was arrested and charged\nwith distributing and trafficking in cocaine. At trial, the\nprosecution introduced bags of a white powdery substance that had\nbeen found in the defendant\u2019s possession. The trial court also\nadmitted into evidence three \u201ccertificates of analysis\u201d from the\nstate forensic laboratory stating that the bags had been \u201cexamined\nwith the following results: The substance was found to contain:\nCocaine.\u201d 557 U.\u00a0S., at 308 (internal quotation marks\nomitted).The Court held that the admission of these\ncertificates, which were executed under oath before a notary,\nviolated the Sixth Amendment. They were created for \u201cthe sole\npurpose of providing evidence against a defendant,\u201d id., at 323,\nand were \u201c\u00a0\u2018quite plainly affidavits,\u2019\u00a0\u201d id., at 330\n(Thomas, J., concurring). The Court emphasized that the\nintroduction of the report to prove the nature of the substance\nfound in the defendant\u2019s possession was tantamount to \u201clive,\nin-court testimony\u201d on that critical fact and that the certificates\ndid \u201cprecisely what a witness does on direct examination.\u201d Id., at\n311 (internal quotation marks omitted). There was no doubt that the\ncertificates were used to prove the truth of the matter they\nasserted. Under state law, \u201cthe sole purpose of the affidavits was\nto provide prima facie evidence of the composition, quality, and\nthe net weight of the analyzed substance.\u201d Ibid. (internal\nquotation marks omitted and emphasis deleted). On these facts, the\nCourt said, it was clear that the certif- icates were \u201ctestimonial\nstatements\u201d that could not be introduced unless their authors were\nsubjected to the \u201c\u00a0\u2018cru- cible of cross-examination.\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nId., at 311, 317 (quoting Crawford, supra, at 61).In Bullcoming, we held that another scientific\nreport could not be used as substantive evidence against the de-\nfendant unless the analyst who prepared and certified the report\nwas subject to confrontation. The defendant in that case had been\nconvicted of driving while intoxicated. At trial, the court\nadmitted into evidence a forensic report certifying that a sample\nof the defendant\u2019s blood had an alcohol concentration of 0.21 grams\nper hundred milli- liters, well above the legal limit. Instead of\ncalling the analyst who signed and certified the forensic report,\nthe prosecution called another analyst who had not performed or\nobserved the actual analysis, but was only familiar with the\ngeneral testing procedures of the laboratory. The Court declined to\naccept this surrogate testimony, despite the fact that the\ntestifying analyst was a \u201cknowledgeable representative of the\nlaboratory\u201d who could \u201cexplain the lab\u2019s processes and the details\nof the report.\u201d 564 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (Kennedy, J., dissenting)\n(slip op., at 1). The Court stated simply: \u201cThe accused\u2019s right is\nto be confronted with the analyst who made the certification.\u201d Id.,\nat ___ (slip op., at 2).Just as in Melendez-Diaz, the forensic report\nthat was \u201cintroduce[d]\u201d in Bullcoming \u201ccontain[ed] a testimonial\ncertification, made in order to prove a fact at a criminal trial.\u201d\n564 U.\u00a0S., at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 7\u20138). The report was\nsigned by the nontestifying analyst who had authored it, stating,\n\u201cI certify that I followed the procedures set out on the reverse of\nthis report, and the statements in this block are correct. The\nconcentration of alcohol in this sample is based on the grams of\nalcohol in one hundred milliliters of blood.\u201d App. in Bullcoming,\nO.\u00a0T. 2010, No.\u00a009\u201310876, p.\u00a062. Critically, the\nreport was introduced at trial for the substantive purpose of\nproving the truth of the matter asserted by its out-of-court\nauthor\u2014namely, that the defendant had a blood-alcohol level of\n0.21. This was the central fact in question at the defendant\u2019s\ntrial, and it was dispositive of his guilt.In concurrence, Justice Sotomayor highlighted\nthe im- portance of the fact that the forensic report had been\nadmitted into evidence for the purpose of proving the truth of the\nmatter it asserted. She emphasized that \u201cthis [was] not a case in\nwhich an expert witness was asked for his independent opinion about\nunderlying testimonial reports that were not themselves admitted\ninto evidence.\u201d 564 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 6) (opinion\nconcurring in part) (citing Fed. Rule Evid. 703). \u201cWe would face a\ndifferent question,\u201d she observed, \u201cif asked to determine the\nconstitutionality of allowing an expert witness to discuss others\u2019\ntestimonial statements if the testimonial statements were not\nthemselves admitted as evidence.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op., at 6).We now confront that question.BIt has long been accepted that an expert\nwitness may voice an opinion based on facts concerning the events\nat issue in a particular case even if the expert lacks first-hand\nknowledge of those facts.At common law, courts developed two ways to deal\nwith this situation. An expert could rely on facts that had already\nbeen established in the record. But because it was not always\npossible to proceed in this manner, and because record evidence was\noften disputed, courts developed the alternative practice of\nallowing an expert to testify in the form of a \u201chypothetical\nquestion.\u201d Under this approach, the expert would be asked to assume\nthe truth of certain factual predicates, and was then asked to\noffer an opinion based on those assumptions. See 1 K. Broun,\nMcCormick on Evidence \u00a714, p. 87 (6th ed. 2006); 1 J.\u00a0Wigmore,\nEvidence \u00a7677, p. 1084 (2d ed. 1923) (\u201cIf the witness is skilled\nenough, his opinion may be adequately obtained upon hypothetical\ndata alone; and it is immate- rial whether he has ever seen the\nperson, place or thing in question\u201d (citation omitted)). The truth\nof the premises could then be established through independent\nevidence, and the factfinder would regard the expert\u2019s testimony to\nbe only as credible as the premises on which it was based.An early example of this approach comes from the\nEnglish case of Beckwith v. Sydebotham, 1 Camp. 116, 170 Eng. Rep.\n897 (K.\u00a0B. 1807), where a party sought to prove the\nseaworthiness of a ship, the Earl of Wycombe, by calling as\nwitnesses \u201cseveral eminent surveyors of ships who had never seen\nthe \u2018Earl of Wycombe.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Ibid. The opposing party objected to\nthe testimony because it relied on facts that were not known to be\ntrue, but the judge disagreed. Because the experts were \u201cpeculiarly\nac- quainted\u201d with \u201ca matter of skill or science,\u201d the judge said,\nthe \u201cjury might be assisted\u201d by their hypothetical opinion based on\ncertain assumed facts. Id., at 117, 170 Eng. Rep., at 897. The\njudge acknowledged the danger of the jury\u2019s being unduly prejudiced\nby wrongly assuming the truth of the hypothetical facts, but the\njudge noted that the experts could be asked on cross-examination\nwhat their opinion of the ship\u2019s seaworthiness would be if\ndifferent hypothetical facts were assumed. If the party that had\ncalled the experts could not independently prove the truth of the\npremises they posited, then the experts\u2019 \u201copinion might not go for\nmuch; but still it was admissible evidence.\u201d Ibid.There is a long tradition of the use of\nhypothetical questions in American courts. In 1887, for example,\nthis Court indicated its approval of the following jury\ninstruction:\u201cAs to the questions, you must understand\nthat they are not evidence; they are mere statements to these\nwitnesses .\u00a0.\u00a0. and, upon the hypothesis or assumption of\nthese questions the witnesses are asked to give their [opinion].\nYou must readily see that the value of the answers to these\nquestions depends largely, if not wholly, upon the fact whether the\nstatements made in these questions are sustained by the proof. If\nthe statements in these questions are not supported by the proof,\nthen the answers to the questions are entitled to no weight,\nbecause based upon false assumptions or statements of facts.\u201d\nForsyth v. Doolittle,120 U.S.\n73(internal quotation marks omitted).Modern rules of evidence continue to permit\nexperts to express opinions based on facts about which they lack\npersonal knowledge, but these rules dispense with the need for\nhypothetical questions. Under both the Illinois and the Federal\nRules of Evidence, an expert may base an opinion on facts that are\n\u201cmade known to the expert at or before the hearing,\u201d but such\nreliance does not constitute admissible evidence of this underlying\ninformation. Ill. Rule Evid. 703; Fed. Rule Evid. 703. Accordingly,\nin jury trials, both Illinois and federal law generally bar an\nexpert from disclosing such inadmissible evidence. [2] In bench trials, however, both the\nIllinois and the Federal Rules place no restriction on the\nrevelation of such information to the factfinder. When the judge\nsits as the trier of fact, it is presumed that the judge will\nunderstand the limited reason for the disclosure of the underlying\ninadmissible information and will not rely on that information for\nany improper purpose. As we have noted, \u201c[i]n bench trials, judges\nroutinely hear inadmissible evidence that they are presumed to\nignore when making decisions.\u201d Harris v. Rivera,454 U.S.\n339, 346 (1981) (per\u00a0curiam). There is a \u201cwell-established\npresumption\u201d that \u201cthe judge [has] adhered to basic rules of\nprocedure,\u201d when the judge is acting as a factfinder. Id., at\n346\u2013347 (emphasis added). See also Gentile v. State Bar of Nev.,501 U.S.\n1030, 1078 (1991) (Rehnquist, C.\u00a0J., dissenting).This feature of Illinois and federal law is\nimportant because Crawford, while departing from prior\nConfrontation Clause precedent in other respects, took pains to\nreaffirm the proposition that the Confrontation Clause \u201cdoes not\nbar the use of testimonial statements for purposes other than\nestablishing the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d 541 U.\u00a0S., at\n59\u201360, n.\u00a09 (citing Tennessee v. Street,471\nU.S. 409). In Street, the defendant claimed that the police\nhad coerced him into adopting the confession of his alleged\naccomplice. The prosecution sought to rebut this claim by showing\nthat the defendant\u2019s confession differed significantly from the\naccomplice\u2019s. Although the accomplice\u2019s confession was clearly a\ntestimonial statement, the Court held that the jurors could hear it\nas long as they were instructed to consider that confession not for\nits truth, but only for the \u201cdistinctive and limited purpose\u201d of\ncomparing it to the defendant\u2019s confession, to see whether the two\nwere identical. Id., at 417.IIIAIn order to assess petitioner\u2019s Confrontation\nClause argument, it is helpful to inventory exactly what Lambatos\nsaid on the stand about Cellmark. She testified to the truth of the\nfollowing matters: Cellmark was an accredited lab, App. 49; the ISP\noccasionally sent forensic samples to Cellmark for DNA testing,\nibid.; according to shipping manifests admitted into evidence, the\nISP lab sent vaginal swabs taken from the victim to Cellmark and\nlater received those swabs back from Cellmark, id., at 52\u201355; and,\nfinally, the Cellmark DNA profile matched a profile produced by the\nISP lab from a sample of petitioner\u2019s blood, id., at 55\u201356.\nLambatos had personal knowledge of all of these matters, and\ntherefore none of this testimony in- fringed petitioner\u2019s\nconfrontation right.Lambatos did not testify to the truth of any\nother matter concerning Cellmark. She made no other reference to\nthe Cellmark report, which was not admitted into evidence and was\nnot seen by the trier of fact. Nor did she testify to anything that\nwas done at the Cellmark lab, and she did not vouch for the quality\nof Cellmark\u2019s work.BThe principal argument advanced to show a\nConfrontation Clause violation concerns the phrase that Lambatos\nused when she referred to the DNA profile that the ISP lab received\nfrom Cellmark. This argument is developed most fully in the\ndissenting opinion, and therefore we refer to the dissent\u2019s\ndiscussion of this issue.In the view of the dissent, the following is the\ncritical portion of Lambatos\u2019 testimony, with the particular words\nthat the dissent finds objectionable italicized:\u201cQ\u2002Was there a computer match generated of the\nmale DNA profile found in semen from the vaginal swabs of [L.J.] to\na male DNA profile that had been identified as having originated\nfrom Sandy Williams?\u201cA\u2002Yes, there was.\u201d Post, at 7 (opinion of\nKagan, J.) (quoting App. 56; emphasis added).According to the dissent, the italicized phrase\nviolated petitioner\u2019s confrontation right because Lambatos lacked\npersonal knowledge that the profile produced by Cellmark was based\non the vaginal swabs taken from the victim, L.\u00a0J. As the\ndissent acknowledges, there would have been \u201cnothing wrong with\nLambatos\u2019s testifying that two DNA profiles\u2014the one shown in the\nCellmark report and the one derived from Williams\u2019s blood\u2014matched\neach other; that was a straightforward application of Lambatos\u2019s\nexpertise.\u201d Post, at 12. Thus, if Lambatos\u2019 testimony had been\nslightly modified as follows, the dissent would see no problem:\u201cQ\u2002Was there a computer match generated of the\nmale DNA profile produced by Cellmark found in semen from the\nvaginal swabs of [L.J.] to a male DNA profile that had been\nidentified as having originated from Sandy Williams?\u201cA Yes, there was.\u201d [3]The defect in this argument is that under\nIllinois law (like federal law) it is clear that the putatively\noffending phrase in Lambatos\u2019 testimony was not admissible for the\npurpose of proving the truth of the matter asserted\u2014i.e., that the\nmatching DNA profile was \u201cfound in semen from the vaginal swabs.\u201d\nRather, that fact was a mere premise of the prosecutor\u2019s question,\nand Lambatos simply assumed that premise to be true when she gave\nher answer indicating that there was a match between the two DNA\nprofiles. There is no reason to think that the trier of fact took\nLambatos\u2019 answer as substantive evidence to establish where the DNA\nprofiles came from.The dissent\u2019s argument would have force if\npetitioner had elected to have a jury trial. In that event, there\nwould have been a danger of the jury\u2019s taking Lambatos\u2019 testimony\nas proof that the Cellmark profile was derived from the sample\nobtained from the victim\u2019s vaginal swabs. Absent an evaluation of\nthe risk of juror confusion and careful jury instructions, the\ntestimony could not have gone to the jury.This case, however, involves a bench trial and\nwe must assume that the trial judge understood that the portion of\nLambatos\u2019 testimony to which the dissent objects was not admissible\nto prove the truth of the matter asserted. [4] The dissent, on the other hand, reaches the\ntruly remarkable conclusion that the wording of Lambatos\u2019 testimony\nconfused the trial judge. Were it not for that wording, the\nargument goes, the judge might have found that the prosecution\nfailed to introduce sufficient admissible evidence to show that the\nCellmark profile was derived from the sample taken from the victim,\nand the judge might have disregarded the DNA evidence. This\nargument reflects a profound lack of respect for the acumen of the\ntrial judge. [5]To begin, the dissent\u2019s argument finds no\nsupport in the trial record. After defense counsel objected to\nLambatos\u2019 testimony, the prosecutor made clear that she was asking\nLambatos only about \u201cher own testing based on [DNA] information\u201d\nthat she had received from Cellmark. App. 56. Recognizing that\nLambatos\u2019 testimony would carry weight only if the underlying\npremises could be established, the judge noted that \u201cthe issue is\n.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0what weight do you give the test [performed by\nLambatos], not do you exclude it.\u201d Id., at 94. This echoes the old\nstatement in Beckwith that an expert\u2019s opinion based on disputed\npremises \u201cmight not go for much; but still it [is] admissible\nevidence.\u201d 1 Camp., at 117, 170 Eng. Rep., at 897. Both the\nIllinois Appellate Court and the Illinois Supreme Court viewed the\nrecord in this way, and we see no ground for disagreement. [6]Second, it is extraordinarily unlikely that any\ntrial judge would be confused in the way that the dissent posits.\nThat Lambatos was not competent to testify to the chain of custody\nof the sample taken from the victim was a point that any trial\njudge or attorney would immediately understand. Lambatos, after\nall, had absolutely nothing to do with the collection of the sample\nfrom the victim, its subsequent handling or preservation by the\npolice in Illinois, or its shipment to and receipt by Cellmark. No\ntrial judge would take Lambatos\u2019 testimony as furnishing \u201cthe\nmissing link\u201d in the State\u2019s evidence regarding the identity of the\nsample that Cellmark tested. See post, at 6 (opinion of Kagan,\nJ.).Third, the admissible evidence left little room\nfor argument that the sample tested by Cellmark came from any\nsource other than the victim\u2019s vaginal swabs. [7] This is so because there is simply no\nplausible explanation for how Cellmark could have produced a DNA\nprofile that matched Williams\u2019 if Cellmark had tested any sample\nother than the one taken from the victim. If any other items that\nmight have contained Williams\u2019 DNA had been sent to Cellmark or\nwere otherwise in Cellmark\u2019s possession, there would have been a\nchance of a mix-up or of cross-contamination. See District\nAttorney\u2019s Office for Third Judicial Dist. v. Osborne, 557 U.S. 52,\n80 (2009) (Alito, J., concurring). But there is absolutely nothing\nto suggest that Cellmark had any such items. Thus, the fact that\nthe Cellmark profile matched Williams\u2014the very man whom the victim\nidentified in a lineup and at trial as her at- tacker\u2014was itself\nstriking confirmation that the sample that Cellmark tested was the\nsample taken from the victim\u2019s vaginal swabs. For these reasons, it\nis fanciful to suggest that the trial judge took Lambatos\u2019\ntestimony as providing critical chain-of-custody evidence.COther than the phrase that Lambatos used in\nreferring to the Cellmark profile, no specific passage in the trial\nrecord has been identified as violating the Confrontation Clause,\nbut it is nevertheless suggested that the State somehow introduced\n\u201cthe substance of Cellmark\u2019s report into evidence.\u201d Post, at 8\n(Kagan, J., dissenting). The main impetus for this argument appears\nto be the (erroneous) view that unless the substance of the report\nwas sneaked in, there would be insufficient evidence in the record\non two critical points: first, that the Cellmark profile was based\non the semen in the victim\u2019s vaginal swabs and, second, that\nCellmark\u2019s procedures were reli- able. This argument is both\nlegally irrelevant for present purposes and factually\nincorrect.As to legal relevance, the question before us is\nwhether petitioner\u2019s Sixth Amendment confrontation right was\nviolated, not whether the State offered sufficient foundational\nevidence to support the admission of Lambatos\u2019 opinion about the\nDNA match. In order to prove these underlying facts, the\nprosecution relied on circumstantial evidence, and the Illinois\ncourts found that this evidence was sufficient to satisfy state-law\nrequirements regarding proof of foundational facts. See 385 Ill.\nApp. 3d, at 366\u2013368, 895 N. E. 2d, at 967\u2013968; 238 Ill. 2d, at 138,\n939 N. E. 2d, at 275. We cannot review that interpretation and\napplication of Illinois law. Thus, even if the record did not\ncontain any evidence that could rationally support a finding that\nCellmark produced a scientifically reliable DNA profile based on L.\nJ.\u2019s vaginal swab, that would not establish a Confrontation Clause\nviolation. If there were no proof that Cellmark produced an\naccurate profile based on that sample, Lambatos\u2019 testimony\nregarding the match would be irrelevant, but the Confrontation\nClause, as interpreted in Crawford, does not bar the admission of\nirrelevant evidence, only testimonial statements by declarants who\nare not subject to cross-examination. [8]It is not correct, however, that the trial\nrecord lacks admissible evidence with respect to the source of the\nsam- ple that Cellmark tested or the reliability of the Cell- mark\nprofile. As to the source of the sample, the State offered\nconventional chain-of-custody evidence, namely, the testimony of\nthe physician who obtained the vaginal swabs, the testimony of the\npolice employees who handled and kept custody of that evidence\nuntil it was sent to Cellmark, and the shipping manifests, which\nprovided evidence that the swabs were sent to Cellmark and then\nreturned to the ISP lab. In addition, as already discussed, the\nmatch between the Cellmark profile and petitioner\u2019s profile was\nitself telling confirmation that the Cellmark profile was deduced\nfrom the semen on the vaginal swabs.This match also provided strong circumstantial\nevidence regarding the reliability of Cellmark\u2019s work. Assuming\n(for the reasons discussed above) that the Cellmark profile was\nbased on the semen on the vaginal swabs, how could shoddy or\ndishonest work in the Cellmark lab [9] have resulted in the production of a DNA profile that\njust so happened to match petitioner\u2019s? If the semen found on the\nvaginal swabs was not petitioner\u2019s and thus had an en- tirely\ndifferent DNA profile, how could sloppy work in the Cellmark lab\nhave transformed that entirely different profile into one that\nmatched petitioner\u2019s? And without access to any other sample of\npetitioner\u2019s DNA (and recall that petitioner was not even under\nsuspicion at this time), how could a dishonest lab technician have\nsubstituted pe- titioner\u2019s DNA profile? Under the circumstances of\nthis case, it was surely permissible for the trier of fact to infer\nthat the odds of any of this were exceedingly low.This analysis reveals that much of the dissent\u2019s\nargument rests on a very clear error. The dissent argues that\nLambatos\u2019 testimony could be \u201ctrue\u201d only if the predicate facts\nasserted in the Cellmark report were true, and therefore Lambatos\u2019\nreference to the report must have been used for the purpose of\nproving the truth of those facts. See post, at 10\u201311. But the truth\nof Lambatos\u2019 testimony, properly understood, was not dependent on\nthe truth of any predicate facts. Lambatos testified that two DNA\nprofiles matched. The correctness of this expert opinion, which the\ndefense was able to test on cross-examination, was not in any way\ndependent on the origin of the samples from which the profiles were\nderived. Of course, Lambatos\u2019 opinion would have lacked probative\nvalue if the prosecution had not introduced other evidence to\nestablish the provenance of the profiles, but that has nothing to\ndo with the truth of her testimony.The dissent is similarly mistaken in its\ncontention that the Cellmark report \u201cwas offered for its truth\nbecause that is all such \u2018basis evidence\u2019 can be offered for.\u201d\nPost, at 13; see also post, at 3 (Thomas, J., concurring in\njudgment) (\u201c[S]tatements introduced to explain the basis of an\nexpert\u2019s opinion are not introduced for a plausible nonhearsay\npurpose\u201d). This view is directly contrary to the current version of\nRule 703 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, which this Court\napproved and sent to Congress in 2000. Under that Rule, \u201cbasis\nevidence\u201d that is not admissible for its truth may be disclosed\neven in a jury trial under appropriate circumstances. The purpose\nfor allowing this disclosure is that it may \u201cassis[t] the jury to\nevaluate the expert\u2019s opinion.\u201d Advisory Committee\u2019s 2000 Notes on\nFed. Rule Evid. 703, 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. App., p. 361. The Rule\n703 approach, which was controversial when adopted, [10] is based on the idea that the\ndisclosure of basis evidence can help the factfinder understand the\nexpert\u2019s thought process and determine what weight to give to the\nexpert\u2019s opinion. For example, if the factfinder were to suspect\nthat the expert relied on factual premises with no support in the\nrecord, or that the expert drew an unwarranted inference from the\npremises on which the expert relied, then the probativeness or\ncredibility of the expert\u2019s opinion would be seriously undermined.\nThe purpose of disclosing the facts on which the expert relied is\nto allay these fears\u2014to show that the expert\u2019s reasoning was not\nillogical, and that the weight of the expert\u2019s opinion does not\ndepend on factual premises unsupported by other evidence in the\nrecord\u2014not to prove the truth of the underlying facts.Perhaps because it cannot seriously dispute the\nlegit- imate nonhearsay purpose of illuminating the expert\u2019s\nthought process, the dissent resorts to the last-ditch argument\nthat, after all, it really does not matter whether Lambatos\u2019\nstatement regarding the source of the Cellmark report was admitted\nfor its truth. The dissent concedes that \u201cthe trial judge might\nhave ignored Lambatos\u2019s statement about the Cellmark report,\u201d but\nnonetheless maintains that \u201cthe admission of that statement\nviolated the Confrontation Clause even if the judge ultimately put\nit aside.\u201d Post, at 15, n.\u00a02. But in a bench trial, it is not\nnecessary for the judge to stop and make a formal statement on the\nrecord regarding the limited reason for which the testimony is\nadmitted. If the judge does not consider the testimony for its\ntruth, the effect is precisely the same. Thus, if the trial judge\nin this case did not rely on the statement in question for its\ntruth, there is simply no way around the proviso in Crawford that\nthe Confrontation Clause applies only to out-of-court statements\nthat are \u201cuse[d]\u201d to \u201cestablis[h] the truth of the matter\nasserted.\u201d 541 U.\u00a0S., at 59\u201360, n.\u00a09 (citing Street,471\nU.S. 409).For all these reasons, we conclude that\npetitioner\u2019s Sixth Amendment confrontation right was not\nviolated.DThis conclusion is entirely consistent with\nBullcoming and Melendez-Diaz. In those cases, the forensic reports\nwere introduced into evidence, and there is no question that this\nwas done for the purpose of proving the truth of what they\nasserted: in Bullcoming that the defendant\u2019s blood alcohol level\nexceeded the legal limit and in Melendez- Diaz that the substance\nin question contained cocaine. Nothing comparable happened here. In\nthis case, the Cellmark report was not introduced into evidence. An\nexpert witness referred to the report not to prove the truth of the\nmatter asserted in the report, i.e., that the report contained an\naccurate profile of the perpetrator\u2019s DNA, but only to establish\nthat the report contained a DNA profile that matched the DNA\nprofile deduced from petitioner\u2019s blood. Thus, just as in Street,\nthe report was not to be considered for its truth but only for the\n\u201cdistinctive and limited purpose\u201d of seeing whether it matched\nsomething else. 471 U.\u00a0S., at 417. The relevance of the match\nwas then established by independent circumstantial evidence showing\nthat the Cellmark report was based on a forensic sample taken from\nthe scene of the crime.Our conclusion will not open the door for the\nkind of abuses suggested by some of petitioner\u2019s amici and the\ndissent. See post, at 10\u201311; Brief for Richard D. Friedman as\nAmicus Curiae 20\u201321. In the hypothetical situations posited, an\nexpert expresses an opinion based on factual premises not supported\nby any admissible evidence, and may also reveal the out-of-court\nstatements on which the expert relied. [11] There are at least four safeguards to prevent\nsuch abuses. First, trial courts can screen out experts who would\nact as mere conduits for hearsay by strictly enforcing the\nrequirement that experts display some genuine \u201cscientific,\ntechnical, or other specialized knowledge [that] will help the\ntrier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in\nissue.\u201d Fed. Rule Evid. 702(a). Second, experts are generally\nprecluded from disclosing inadmissible evidence to a jury. See Fed.\nRule Evid. 703; People v. Pasch,152 Ill. 2d 133, 175\u2013176,604 N.E.2d 294, 310\u2013311 (1992). Third, if such evidence is\ndisclosed, the trial judges may and, under most circumstances,\nmust, instruct the jury that out-of-court statements cannot be\naccepted for their truth, and that an expert\u2019s opinion is only as\ngood as the independent evidence that establishes its underlying\npremises. See Fed. Rules Evid. 105, 703; People v. Scott,148 Ill. 2d 479, 527\u2013528,594 N.E.2d 217, 236\u2013237 (1992). And fourth, if the prosecution\ncannot muster any independent admissible evidence to prove the\nfoundational facts that are essential to the relevance of the\nexpert\u2019s testimony, then the expert\u2019s testimony cannot be given any\nweight by the trier of fact. [12]IVAEven if the Cellmark report had been\nintroduced for its truth, we would nevertheless conclude that there\nwas no Confrontation Clause violation. The Confrontation Clause\nrefers to testimony by \u201cwitnesses against\u201d an accused. Both the\nnoted evidence scholar James Henry Wigmore and Justice Harlan\ninterpreted the Clause in a strictly literal sense as referring\nsolely to persons who testify in court, but we have not adopted\nthis narrow view. It has been said that \u201c[t]he difficulty with the\nWigmore-Harlan view in its purest form is its tension with much of\nthe apparent history surrounding the evolution of the right of\nconfrontation at common law.\u201d White v. Illinois,502 U.S.\n346, 360 (1992) (Thomas, J., concurring). \u201c[T]he principal evil\nat which the Confrontation Clause was directed,\u201d the Court\nconcluded in Crawford, \u201cwas the civil-law mode of criminal\nprocedure, and particularly its use of ex parte examinations as\nevidence against the accused.\u201d 541 U.\u00a0S., at 50. \u201c[I]n\nEngland, pretrial examinations of suspects and witnesses by\ngovernment officials \u2018were sometimes read in court in lieu of live\ntestimony.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Bryant, 562 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 6)\n(quoting Crawford, supra, at 43). The Court has thus interpreted\nthe Confrontation Clause as prohibiting modern-day practices that\nare tantamount to the abuses that gave rise to the recognition of\nthe confrontation right. But any further expansion would strain the\nconstitutional text.The abuses that the Court has identified as\nprompting the adoption of the Confrontation Clause shared the\nfollowing two characteristics: (a) they involved out-of-court\nstatements having the primary purpose of accusing a targeted\nindividual of engaging in criminal conduct and (b) they involved\nformalized statements such as affidavits, depositions, prior\ntestimony, or confessions. In all but one of the post-Crawford\ncases [13] in which a\nConfrontation Clause violation has been found, both of these\ncharacteristics were present. See Bullcoming, 564 U.\u00a0S., at\n308 (slip op., at 3\u20134) (certified lab report having purpose of\nshowing that defendant\u2019s blood-alcohol level exceeded legal limit);\nMelendez-Diaz, 557 U.\u00a0S., at 308 (certified lab report having\npurpose of showing that substance connected to defendant contained\ncocaine); Crawford, supra, at 38 (custodial statement made after\nMiranda warnings that shifted blame from declarant to accused). [14] The one exception\noccurred in Hammon v. Indiana,547\nU.S. 813\u2013832 (2006), which was decided together with Davis v.\nWashington, but in Hammon and every other post-Crawford case in\nwhich the Court has found a violation of the confrontation right,\nthe statement at issue had the primary purpose of accusing a\ntargeted individual.BIn Hammon, the one case in which an informal\nstatement was held to violate the Confrontation Clause, we\nconsidered statements elicited in the course of police in-\nterrogation. We held that a statement does not fall within the\nambit of the Clause when it is made \u201cunder circumstances\nobjectively indicating that the primary purpose of the\ninterrogation is to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing\nemergency.\u201d 547 U.\u00a0S., at 822. In Bryant, another\npolice-interrogation case, we explained that a person who makes a\nstatement to resolve an ongoing emergency is not acting like a\ntrial witness because the declarant\u2019s purpose is not to provide a\nsolemn declaration for use at trial, but to bring an end to an\nongoing threat. See 562 U.\u00a0S., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 11,\n14). We noted that \u201cthe prospect of fabrication .\u00a0.\u00a0. is\npresumably significantly diminished\u201d when a statement is made under\nsuch circumstances, id., at ___ (slip op., at 14) and that\nreliability is a salient characteristic of a statement that falls\noutside the reach of the Confrontation Clause, id., at ___\u2013___\n(slip op., at 14\u201315). We emphasized that if a statement is not made\nfor \u201cthe primary purpose of creating an out-of-court substitute for\ntrial testimony,\u201d its admissibility \u201cis the concern of state and\nfederal rules of evidence, not the Confrontation Clause.\u201d Id., at\n___\u2013___ (slip op., at 11\u201312).In Melendez-Diaz and Bullcoming, the Court held\nthat the particular forensic reports at issue qualified as\ntestimonial statements, but the Court did not hold that all\nforensic reports fall into the same category. Introduction of the\nreports in those cases ran afoul of the Confrontation Clause\nbecause they were the equivalent of affidavits made for the purpose\nof proving the guilt of a particular criminal defendant at trial.\nThere was nothing resembling an ongoing emergency, as the suspects\nin both cases had already been captured, and the tests in question\nwere relatively simple and can generally be performed by a single\nanalyst. In addition, the technicians who prepared the reports must\nhave realized that their contents (which reported an elevated\nblood-alcohol level and the presence of an illegal drug) would be\nincriminating.CThe Cellmark report is very different. It\nplainly was not prepared for the primary purpose of accusing a\ntargeted individual. In identifying the primary purpose of an\nout-of-court statement, we apply an objective test. Bryant, 562\nU.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 13). We look for the primary\npurpose that a reasonable person would have ascribed to the\nstatement, taking into account all of the surrounding\ncircumstances. Ibid.Here, the primary purpose of the Cellmark\nreport, viewed objectively, was not to accuse petitioner or to\ncreate evidence for use at trial. When the ISP lab sent the sample\nto Cellmark, its primary purpose was to catch a dangerous rapist\nwho was still at large, not to obtain evidence for use against\npetitioner, who was neither in custody nor under suspicion at that\ntime. Similarly, no one at Cellmark could have possibly known that\nthe profile that it produced would turn out to inculpate\npetitioner\u2014or for that matter, anyone else whose DNA profile was in\na law enforcement database. Under these circumstances, there was no\n\u201cprospect of fabrication\u201d and no incentive to produce anything\nother than a scientifi- cally sound and reliable profile. Id., at\n___ (slip op., at 14).The situation in which the Cellmark technicians\nfound themselves was by no means unique. When lab technicians are\nasked to work on the production of a DNA profile, they often have\nno idea what the consequences of their work will be. In some cases,\na DNA profile may provide powerful incriminating evidence against a\nperson who is identified either before or after the profile is\ncompleted. But in others, the primary effect of the profile is to\nexonerate a suspect who has been charged or is under investigation.\nThe technicians who prepare a DNA profile generally have no way of\nknowing whether it will turn out to be incriminating or\nexonerating\u2014or both.It is also significant that in many labs,\nnumerous technicians work on each DNA profile. See Brief for New\nYork County District Attorney\u2019s Office et\u00a0al. as Amici Curiae\n6 (New York lab uses at least 12 technicians for each case); People\nv. Johnson, 389 Ill. App. 3d 618, 627, 906 N.E.2d 70, 79 (2009)\n(\u201c[A]pproximately 10 Cellmark analysts were involved in the\nlaboratory work in this case\u201d). When the work of a lab is divided\nup in such a way, it is likely that the sole purpose of each\ntechnician is simply to perform his or her task in accordance with\naccepted procedures.Finally, the knowledge that defects in a DNA\nprofile may often be detected from the profile itself provides a\nfurther safeguard. In this case, for example, Lambatos testified\nthat she would have been able to tell from the profile if the\nsample used by Cellmark had been degraded prior to testing. As\nnoted above, moreover, there is no real chance that \u201csample\ncontamination, sample switching, mislabeling, [or] fraud\u201d could\nhave led Cellmark to produce a DNA profile that falsely matched\npetitioner. Post, at 21 (Kagan, J., dissenting). At the time of the\ntesting, petitioner had not yet been identified as a suspect, and\nthere is no suggestion that anyone at Cellmark had a sample of his\nDNA to swap in by malice or mistake. And given the complexity of\nthe DNA molecule, it is inconceivable that shoddy lab work would\nsomehow produce a DNA profile that just so happened to have the\nprecise genetic makeup of petitioner, who just so happened to be\npicked out of a lineup by the victim. The prospect is beyond\nfanciful.In short, the use at trial of a DNA report\nprepared by a modern, accredited laboratory \u201cbears little if any\nresemblance to the historical practices that the Confrontation\nClause aimed to eliminate.\u201d Bryant, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 2)\n(Thomas, J., concurring).*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*For the two independent reasons explained\nabove, we conclude that there was no Confrontation Clause violation\nin this case. Accordingly, the judgment of the Supreme Court of\nIllinois isAffirmed.Notes1Consistent with the\nFederal Rules, Illinois Rule of Evidence 703 provides as follows:\n\u201cThe facts or data in the particular case upon which an expert\nbases an opinion or inference may be those perceived by or made\nknown to the expert at or before the hearing. If of a type\nreasonably relied upon by experts in the particular field in\nforming opinions or inferences upon the subject, the facts or data\nneed not be admissible inevidence.\u201d2But disclosure of these\nfacts or data to the jury is permitted if the value of disclosure\n\u201csubstantially outweighs [any] prejudicial effect,\u201d Fed. Rule Evid.\n703, or \u201cthe probative value . . . outweighs the risk of unfair\nprejudice.\u201d People v. Pasch,152 Ill. 2d 133, 223,604 N.E.2d 294, 333 (1992). When this disclosure occurs, \u201cthe\nunderlying facts\u201d are revealed to the jury \u201cfor the limited purpose\nof explaining the basis for [the expert\u2019s] opinion\u201d and not \u201cfor\nthe truth of the matter asserted.\u201d Id., at 176, 604 N.\u00a0E. 2d,\nat 311.3The small difference\nbetween what Lambatos actually said on the stand and the slightly\nrevised version that the dissent would find un-objectionable shows\nthat, despite the dissent\u2019s rhetoric, its narrow argument would\nhave little practical effect in future cases. Prosecutors would be\nallowed to do exactly what the prosecution did in this case so long\nas their testifying experts\u2019 testimony was slightly modified along\nthe lines shown above. Following that course presumably would not\nconstitute a \u201cprosecutorial dodge,\u201d \u201csubterfuge,\u201d \u201cindirection,\u201d\nthe \u201cneat trick\u201d of \u201csneak[ing]\u201d in evidence, or the countenancing\nof constitutional violations with \u201ca wink and a nod.\u201d See post, at\n3, 16, 17, 12 (opinion of Kagan, J.).4We do not suggest that\nthe Confrontation Clause applies differently depending on the\nidentity of the factfinder. Cf. post, at 14\u201315 (opinion of Kagan,\nJ.). Instead, our point is that the identity of the factfinder\nmakes a big difference in evaluating the likelihood that the\nfactfinder mistakenly based its decision on inadmissible\nevidence.5See post, at 14 (opinion\nof Kagan, J.) (\u201cI do not doubt that a judge typically will do\nbetter than a jury in excluding such inadmissible evidence from his\ndecisionmaking process. Perhaps the judge did so here\u201d (emphasis\nadded)).6The dissent finds\nevidence of the trial judge\u2019s confusion in his statement that\npetitioner is \u201c\u00a0\u2018the guy whose DNA, according to the evidence\nfrom the experts, is in the semen recovered from the victim\u2019s\nvagina.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Post, at 14 (emphasis added). The dissent\ninterprets the phrase \u201caccording to the evidence from the experts\u201d\nas a reference to what one expert, Lambatos, said about the origin\nof the sample that Cellmark tested. In context, however, the\njudge\u2019s statement is best understood as attributing to Lambatos\nnothing more than the conclusion that there was a match between the\ntwo DNA profiles that were compared. The foundational facts, that\none of the profiles came from the defendant and that the other came\nfrom \u201c\u00a0\u2018the semen recovered from the victim\u2019s vagina,\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nwere established not by expert testimony but by ordinary\nchain-of-custody evidence.7Our point is not that\nadmissible evidence regarding the identity of the sample that\nCellmark tested excuses the admission of testimonial hearsay on\nthis matter. Compare post, at 5\u20136 (Thomas, J., concurring in\njudgment), with post, at 14 (Kagan, J., dissenting). Rather, our\npoint is that, because there was substantial (albeit\ncircumstantial) evidence on this matter, there is no reason to\ninfer that the trier of fact must have taken Lambatos\u2019 statement as\nproviding \u201cthe missing link.\u201d8Applying the Due Process\nClause, we have held that a federal court may determine whether a\nrational trier of fact could have found the existence of all the\nelements needed for conviction for a state offense. Jackson v.\nVirginia,443 U.S.\n307, 314 (1979) , but petitioner has not raised a due process\nclaim. And in any event, L. J.\u2019s identification of petitioner as\nher assailant would be sufficient to defeat any such\nclaim.9See post, at 18 (Kagan,\nJ., dissenting).10See\nAdvisory Committee\u2019s 2000 Notes on Rule 703, at 361.11Both\nJustice Thomas and Justice Kagan quote statements in D. Kaye, D.\nBernstein, & J. Mnookin, The New Wigmore: Expert Evidence\n\u00a74.10.1, pp. 196\u2013197 (2d ed. 2011) (hereinafter New Wigmore), that\nare critical of the theory that an expert, without violating the\nConfrontation Clause, may express an opinion that is based on\ntestimonial hearsay and may, in some circumstances, disclose that\ntestimonial hearsay to the trier of fact. The principal basis for\nthis criticism seems to be the fear that juries, even if given\nlimiting instructions, will view the disclosed hearsay as evidence\nof the truth of the matter asserted. See id., at 196, n. 36\n(referring reader to the more detailed discussion in Mnookin,\nExpert Evidence and the Confrontation Clause After Crawford v.\nWashington, 15 J.\u00a0L. & Pol\u2019y 791 (2007)); New Wigmore\n197,and n.\u00a039 (citing jury cases); Mnookin, supra, at 802\u2013804,\n811\u2013813. This argument plainly has no application in a case like\nthis one, in which a judge sits as the trier of fact. In the 2012\nSupplement of The New Wigmore, the authors discuss the present case\nand criticize the reasoning of the Illinois courts as follows: \u201cThe\nproblem with [the not-for-the-truth-of-the-matter argument accepted\nby the Illinois courts] is that Lambatos had to rely on the truth\nof the statements in the Cellmark report to reach her own\nconclusion. The claim that evidence that the jury must credit in\norder to credit the conclusion of the expert is introduced for\nsomething other than its truth is sheer fiction.\u201d New Wigmore\n\u00a74.11.6, at 24 (2012 Supp.) (emphasis added). This discussion is\nflawed. It overlooks the fact that there was no jury in this case,\nand as we have explained, the trier of fact did not have to rely on\nany testimonial hearsay in order to find that Lambatos\u2019 testimony\nabout the DNA match was supported by adequate foundational evidence\nand was thus probative.12Our\ndiscussion of the first ground for our decision cannot conclude\nwithout commenting on the Kocak case, which dramatically appears at\nthe beginning of the dissent. In that case, a Cellmark lab analyst\nrealized while testifying at a pretrial hearing that there was an\nerror in the lab\u2019s report and that the DNA profile attributed to\nthe accused was actually that of the victim. The lesson of this\ncautionary tale is nothing more than the truism that it is possible\nfor an apparently incriminating DNA profile to be mistakenly\nattributed to an accused. But requiring that the lab analyst or\nanalysts who produced the DNA profile be called as prosecution\nwitnesses is neither sufficient nor necessary to prevent such\nerrors. Since samples may be mixed up or contaminated at many\npoints along the way from a crime scene to the lab, calling one or\nmore lab analysts will not necessarily catch all such mistakes. For\nexample, a mistake might be made by a clerical employee responsible\nfor receiving shipments of samples and then providing them to the\nlab\u2019s technicians. What is needed is for the trier of fact to make\nsure that the evidence, whether direct or circumstantial, rules out\nthe possibility of such mistakes at every step along the way. And\nin the usual course of authentication, defense counsel will have\naccess to sufficient information to inquire into, question, or\nchallenge the procedures used by a laboratory if this seems to be a\nprudent and productive strategy.13Experience might yet show that the\nholdings in those cases should be reconsidered for the reasons,\namong others, expressed in the dissents the decisions produced.\nThose decisions are not challenged in this case and are to be\ndeemed binding precedents, but they can and should be distinguished\non the facts here.14With\nrespect to Crawford, see Davis, 547 U.\u00a0S., at 840 (Thomas, J.,\nconcurring in judgment in part and dissenting in\npart).",
