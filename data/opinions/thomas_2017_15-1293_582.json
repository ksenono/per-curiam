Respondent failed to present his statutory argument either\nto the Patent and Trademark Office or to the Court of Appeals, and\nwe declined respondent\u2019s invitation to grant certiorari on this\nquestion.Ante, at 9. I see no reason to address this legal\nquestion in the first instance. SeeStar Athletica, L. L. C.v.Varsity Brands, Inc., 580 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2017)\n(slip op., at 6).I also write separately because \u201cI continue to\nbelieve that when the government seeks to restrict truthful speech\nin order to suppress the ideas it conveys, strict scrutiny is\nappropriate, whether or not the speech in question may be\ncharacterized as \u2018commercial.\u2019\u00a0\u201dLorillard Tobacco Co.v.Reilly, 533 U.\u00a0S. 525, 572 (2001) (Thomas, J.,\nconcurring in part and concurring in judgment); see also,e.g.,44 Liquormart, Inc.v.Rhode Island, 517\nU.\u00a0S. 484, 518 (1996) (same). I nonetheless join Part IV of\nJustice Alito\u2019s opinion because it correctly concludes that the\ndisparagement clause, 15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71052(a), is\nunconstitutional even under the less stringent test announced inCentral Hudson Gas & Elec.
