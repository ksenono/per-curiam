I write\nseparately only to note my disagreement with the suggestion in my\ncolleague\u2019s concurrence that a Senate Report is not an appropriate\nsource for this Court to consider when interpreting a statute.Legislative history is of course not the law,\nbut that does not mean it cannot aid us in our understanding of a\nlaw. Just as courts are capable of assessing the reliability and\nutility of evidence generally, they are capable of assessing the\nreliability and utility of legislative-history materials.Committee reports, like the Senate Report the\nCourt discusses here, seeante,at 3\u20134, 11\u201312, 16\u201318, are a\nparticularly reliable source to which we can look to ensure our\nfidelity to Congress\u2019 intended meaning. SeeGarciav.United States, 469 U.\u00a0S. 70, 76 (1984) (\u201cIn surveying\nlegislative history we have repeatedly stated that the\nauthoritative source for finding the Legislature\u2019s intent lies in\nthe Committee Reports on the bill, which \u2018represen[t] the\nconsidered and collective understanding of those Congressmen\ninvolved in drafting and studying proposed legislation\u2019\u00a0\u201d\n(quotingZuberv.Allen, 396 U.\u00a0S. 168, 186\n(1969) )). Bills presented to Congress for consideration are\ngenerally accompanied by a committee report. Such reports are\ntypically circulated at least two days before a bill is to be\nconsidered on the floor and provide Members of Congress and their\nstaffs with information about \u201ca bill\u2019s context, purposes, policy\nimplications, and details,\u201d along with information on its\nsupporters and opponents. R. Katzmann, Judging Statutes 20, and n.\n62 (2014) (citing A. LaRue, Senate Manual Containing the Standing\nRules, Orders, Laws, and Resolutions Affecting the Business of the\nUnited States Senate, S. Doc. No. 107\u20131, p. 17 (2001)). These\nmaterials \u201chave long been important means of informing the whole\nchamber about proposed legislation,\u201d Katzmann, Judging\nStatutes,at 19, a point Members themselves have emphasized\nover the years.[1]* It is thus\nno surprise that legislative staffers view committee and conference\nreports as the most reliable type of legislative history. See Gluck\n& Bressman, Statutory Interpretation From the Inside\u2014An\nEmpirical Study of Congressional Drafting, Delegation and the\nCanons: Part I, 65 Stan. L.\u00a0Rev. 901, 977 (2013).Legislative history can be particularly helpful\nwhen a statute is ambiguous or deals with especially complex\nmatters. But even when, as here, a statute\u2019s meaning can clearly be\ndiscerned from its text, consulting reliable legislative history\ncan still be useful, as it enables us to corroborate and fortify\nour understanding of the text. See,e.g., Tapiav.United\nStates, 564 U.\u00a0S. 319 \u2013332 (2011);Carrv.United States, 560 U.\u00a0S. 438 \u2013458 (2010). Moreover,\nconfirming our construction of a statute by considering reliable\nlegislative history shows respect for and promotes comity with a\ncoequal branch of Government. See Katzmann,Judging\nStatutes, at 35\u201336.For these reasons, I do not think it wise for\njudges to close their eyes to reliable legislative history\u2014and the\nrealities of how Members of Congress create and enact laws\u2014when it\nis available.Notes1*\u00a0See,e.g.,Hearings on the Nomination of Judge Antonin Scalia, To Be Associate\nJustice of the Supreme Court of the United States before the Senate\nCommittee on the Judiciary, 99th Cong., 2d Sess., 65\u201366 (1986)\n(Sen. Charles E. Grassley) (\u201c[A]s one who has served in Congress\nfor 12 years, legislative history is very important to those of us\nhere who want further detailed expression of that legislative\nintent\u201d); Mikva, Reading and Writing Statutes, 28 S. Tex.\nL.\u00a0Rev. 181, 184 (1986) (\u201cThe committee report is the bone\nstructure of the legislation. It is the road map that explains why\nthings are in and things are out of the statute\u201d); Brudney,\nCongressional Commentary on Judicial Interpretations of Statutes:\nIdle Chatter or Telling Response? 93 Mich. L.\u00a0Rev. 1, 28\n(1994) (compiling the views of former Members on \u201cthe central\nimportance of committee reports to their own understanding of\nstatutory text\u201d). In fact, some Members \u201care more likely to vote\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. based on a reading of the legislative history than\non a reading of the statute itself.\u201d Gluck & Bressman,\nStatutory Interpretation From the Inside\u2014An Empirical Study of\nCongressional Drafting, Delegation and the Canons: Part I, 65 Stan.\nL. Rev. 901, 968 (2013).",
