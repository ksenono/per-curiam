LYNCH, ATTORNEY GENERALon writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the second circuit[May 19, 2016]Justice Sotomayor, with whom Justice Thomas\nand Justice Breyer join, dissenting.The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) metes\nout severe immigration consequences to a noncitizen convicted of\nany of a number of \u201caggravated felon[ies].\u201d 8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a71101(a)(43). An offense \u201cdescribed in\u201d 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7844(i)\u2014a federal arson statute\u2014qualifies as such a crime.In this case, petitioner, who goes by George\nLuna, was convicted of third-degree arson under N. Y. Penal Law\nAnn. \u00a7150.10 (West 2010), which punishes anyone who (1)\n\u201cintentionally\u201d (2) \u201cdamages,\u201d by (3) \u201cstarting a fire or causing\nan explosion,\u201d (4) \u201ca building or motor vehicle.\u201d By contrast, the\nfederal arson statute, 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7844(i), applies when\nsomeone (1) \u201cmaliciously\u201d (2) \u201cdamages or destroys,\u201d (3) \u201cby means\nof fire or an explosive,\u201d (4) \u201cany building, vehicle, or other real\nor personal property\u201d (5) \u201cused in interstate or foreign commerce.\u201d\nThere is one more element in the federal offense than in the state\noffense\u2014(5), the interstate or foreign commerce element. Luna thus\nwas not convicted of an offense \u201cdescribed in\u201d the federal statute.\nCase closed.Not for the majority. It dubs the fifth element\n\u201cjurisdictional,\u201d then relies on contextual clues to read it out of\nthe statute altogether. As a result of the majority\u2019s sleuthing,\nLuna\u2014a long-time legal permanent resident\u2014is foreclosed from even\nappealing to the sound discretion of the Attorney General to obtain\nrelief from removal. Because precedent and the text and structure\nof the INA require the opposite result, I respectfully dissent.IANoncitizens convicted of crimes face various\nconsequences under the INA. Among the harshest of those\nconsequences fall on noncitizens convicted of 1 of the\napproximately 80 \u201caggravated felonies.\u201d A crime that falls into one\nof the listed provisions can be an aggravated felony \u201cwhether in\nviolation of Federal or State law\u201d or \u201cin violation of the law of a\nforeign country.\u201d See 8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71101(a)(43).An aggravated felony conviction has two primary\nrepercussions for noncitizens: It renders them deportable,\n\u00a71227(a)(2)(A)(iii), and it makes them categorically ineligible for\nseveral forms of immigration relief ordinarily left to the\ndiscretion of the Attorney General. See,e.g.,\u00a7\u00a71229b(a)\u2013(b) (cancellation of removal).The dozens of aggravated felonies in the INA are\nspecified in two main ways. First, some are specified by reference\nto a generic crime. It is an aggravated felony, for instance, to\ncommit \u201cmurder, rape, or sexual abuse of a minor.\u201d \u00a71101(a)(43)(A).\nSome of those crimes use a federal definition as one of the\nelements. For example: \u201cIllicit trafficking in a controlled\nsubstance (as defined in[ 21 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7802]).\u201d 8\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71101(a)(43)(B) (emphasis added). (\u201cIllicit\ntrafficking\u201d is a generic crime; the element of \u201ccontrolled\nsubstance\u201d takes the meaning in 21 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7802, the\n\u201cDefinitions\u201d provision of the Controlled Substances Act.)Second, it lists crimes that are wholly\n\u201cdescribed in\u201d the federal criminal code. See, e.g.,\u00a71101(a)(43)(H) (\u201can offense described in section 875, 876, 877, or\n1202 of title 18 (relating to the demand for or receipt of\nransom)\u201d); \u00a71101(a)(43)(I) (\u201can offense described in section 2251,\n2251A, or 2252 of title 18 (relating to child pornography)\u201d). The\nGovernment contends that Luna committed a crime in this second\ncategory: an \u201coffense described in\u201d 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7844\u00a0(i), which criminalizes arson. 8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a71101\u00a0(a)\u00a0(43)\u00a0(E)\u00a0(i).BIn 2006, Luna was found removable from the\nUnited States. He attempted to apply for cancellation of removal, a\nform of relief available to long-time legal permanent residents at\nthe discretion of the Attorney General. \u00a71229b(a). Nothing in\nLuna\u2019s history would otherwise preclude cancellation. He was the\nsole source of financial support for his U. S. citizen fianc\u00e9e,\nenrolled in college and studying engineering, a homeowner, and a\nlaw-abiding legal permanent resident since he was brought to the\nUnited States as a child over 30 years ago, aside from the one\nthird-degree arson conviction at issue in this case, for which he\nserved a day in jail.But the Immigration Judge found\u2014and the Board of\nImmigration Appeals and the Second Circuit confirmed\u2014that Luna was\nineligible for cancellation of removal. Luna\u2019s New York State arson\nconviction, the judge held, qualified as an aggravated felony under\nthe provision for \u201can offense described in\u201d \u00a7844(i), a federal\narson statute. See \u00a71101(a)(43)(E)(i). Aggravated felons are\nineligible for can-cellation of removal. See \u00a71229b(a)(3). Luna\u2019s\ncancellation-of-removal application was thus summarily denied.IIBut the offense of which Luna was convicted isnot \u201cdescribed in\u201d \u00a7844(i). This Court\u2019s ordinary method of\ninterpreting the aggravated felony statute, the plain text of that\nprovision, and the structure of the INA all confirm as much.AThis is not the first time the Court has been\ntasked with determining whether a state offense constitutes an\n\u201caggravated felony\u201d under the INA. Until today, the Court has\nalways required the state offense to matcheveryelement of\nthe listed \u201caggravated felony.\u201dKawashimav.Holder,\n565 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 4); see alsoMoncrieffev.Holder, 569 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2013)\n(slip op., at 4\u20135);Carachuri-Rosendov.Holder, 560\nU.\u00a0S. 563, 580 (2010) ;Nijhawanv.Holder, 557\nU.\u00a0S. 29, 33 (2009) ;Gonzalesv.Duenas-Alvarez, 549 U.\u00a0S. 183, 185 (2007) ;Lopezv.Gonzales, 549 U.\u00a0S. 47 \u201353 (2006);Leocalv.Ashcroft, 543 U.\u00a0S. 1, 8 (2004) .Our ordinary methodology thus confirms that the\nfederal arson statute does not describe the New York arson statute\nunder which Luna was convicted. As I have outlined above, seesupra, at 1, the federal statute is more limited: It applies\nonly to fires that involve \u201cinterstate or foreign commerce.\u201d The\nstate statute contains no such limitation. Thus, under the approach\nwe have used in every case to date, the omission of the interstate\ncommerce element means that Luna\u2019s state arson conviction was not\nan aggravated felony under the INA.BThe plain language of the statute supports\nthis straightforward approach. The word \u201cdescribe\u201d means to\n\u201cexpress,\u201d \u201cportray,\u201d or \u201crepresent.\u201d See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary\n445 (6th ed. 1990); Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary\n610 (1986). A description may be \u201cdetailed\u201d or it may be general,\nsetting forth only the \u201crecognizable features, or characteristic\nmarks,\u201d of the thing described while leaving the rest to the\nimagination. 4 Oxford English Dictionary 512 (2d ed. 1989). For\nexample, a Craigslist ad describing an apartment with \u201cin-unit\nlaundry, a dishwasher, rooftop access, central A/C, and a walk-in\ncloset\u201d may leave much to the imagination. After all, the\ndescription does not mention the apartment\u2019s square footage,\nwindows, or floor number. But though the ad omits features, we\nwould still call it a \u201cdescription\u201d because it accurately conveys\nthe \u201crecognizable features\u201d of the apartment.However, even the most general description\ncannot refer to features that the thing being described does not\nhave. The ad is only an accurate description if the apartment\n\u201cdescribed in\u201d it hasat leastthe five features listed. If\nthe apartment only has four of the five listed features\u2014there is no\nrooftop access, say, or the walk-in closet is not so much walk-in\nas shimmy-in\u2014then the Craigslist ad no longer \u201cdescribes\u201d the\napartment. Rather, itmisdescribes it.So, too, with the statutes in this case. The\nfederal description can be general as long as it is still\naccurate\u2014that is, as long as the state law has at least all of the\nelements in the federal law. But there is no meaning of \u201cdescribe\u201d\nthat allows the Court to say \u00a7844(i) \u201cdescribes\u201d the New York\noffense when the New York offense only has four of the five\nelements listed in \u00a7844(i). Section 844(i) misdescribes the New\nYork offense just as surely as the too-good-to-be-true Craigslist\nad misdescribes the real-life apartment.CThe structure of the INA confirms that\nconclusion and makes clear that we need not contort the ordinary,\naccepted meaning of the phrase \u201cdescribed in.\u201d The INA has many\noverlapping provisions that assign carefully calibrated\nconsequences to various types of criminal convictions. The Court\nthus need not interpret any provision\u2014and certainly none of the\naggravated felony provisions, among the harshest in the INA\u2014as\nbroadly as possible because the INA as a whole ensures that serious\ncriminal conduct is adequately captured.That overlapping structure is apparent\nthroughout the INA. First, the aggravated felony list itself has\nmultiple fail-safe provisions. Most serious offenses, for instance,\nwill qualify as \u201ccrime[s] of violence .\u00a0.\u00a0. for which the\nterm of imprisonment [is] at least one year,\u201d 8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a71101(a)(43)(F), even if they are not covered by a more specific\nprovision in the aggravated felony list. Had his crime been charged\nas a more serious arson and had he been punished by one year of\nimprisonment instead of one day, Luna might have qualified as an\naggravated felon under that provision. SeeSantanav.Holder, 714 F.\u00a03d 140, 145 (CA2 2013) (second-degree\narson in New York is a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d).[1]Second, other sections of the INA provide\nintertwining coverage for serious crimes. Some examples of\nprovisions that encompass many offenses include those for the\ncommission of a \u201ccrime involving moral turpitude,\u201d a firearms\noffense, or a controlled substance offense, all of which will\nrender a noncitizen removable, even if he or she has not committed\nan aggravated felony. See \u00a7\u00a71227(a)(2)(A)(i), (B)(i), (C);\n\u00a7\u00a71182(a)(2)(A)(i)\u2013(ii). Cf.Judulangv.Holder, 565\nU.\u00a0S. 42, 48 (2011) (commenting on the breadth of the \u201ccrime\ninvolving moral turpitude\u201d provision).[2]And finally, in Luna\u2019s case or anyone else\u2019s,\nthe Attorney General can exercise her discretion to deny relief to\na serious criminal whether or not that criminal has been convicted\nof an aggravated felony. SeeCarachuri-Rosendo,560\nU.\u00a0S., at 581 (doubting that a narrow reading of \u00a71101(a)(43)\nwill have \u201cany practical effect on policing our Nation\u2019s\nborders\u201d).To be sure, on Luna\u2019s reading, some serious\nconduct may not be captured by the INA. But not nearly so much as\nthe majority suggests. By contrast, once the aggra-vated felony\nstatute applies to a noncitizen, no provision in the INA\u2014and\nvirtually no act by the Attorney General\u2014can prevent him or her\nfrom being removed.Looking for consistency in the aggravated felony\nprovisions of the INA is often a fool\u2019s errand. SeeKawashima, 565 U.\u00a0S., at ___, n.\u00a02 (slip op., at\n9, n.\u00a02) (Ginsburg, J., dissenting) (noting the absurdity of\nmaking a tax misdemeanor, but not driving while drunk and causing\nserious bodily injury, an aggravated felony). But the structure of\nthe INA gives the Court no reason to read the aggravated felony\nprovisions as broadly as possible.[3] That is why this Court has repeatedly cautioned against\ninterpreting the aggravated felony section to sweep in offenses\nthat\u2014like many state arson convictions\u2014may be neither aggravated\nnor felonies. SeeCarachuri-Rosendo, 560 U.\u00a0S., at 574;\nBrief for National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers\net\u00a0al. asAmici Curiae28\u201329 (collecting state\nmisdemeanor arson statutes).IIIThe majority denies Luna the opportunity to\npresent his case to the Attorney General based on two \u201ccontextual\nconsiderations,\u201dante,at 7, and an intuition about how the\nstatute ought to work. None are sufficiently persuasive to overcome\nthe most natural reading of the aggravated felony statute.AThe majority first perceives a conflict\nbetween Luna\u2019s reading of the INA and what it calls the\n\u201cpenultimate sentence\u201d of the aggravated felony statute. The\n\u201cpenultimate sentence\u201d provides that an offense can be an\naggravated felony \u201cwhether in violation of Federal or State law\u201d or\n\u201cin violation of the law of a foreign country.\u201d 8\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71101(a)(43). The majority claims that Luna\u2019s\nreading of the INA would vitiate the quoted proviso.Ante,at 8\u201310.It is true that, on Luna\u2019s reading,someof the aggra-vated felonies listed in the INA (including \u201can\noffense de-scribed in\u201d \u00a7844(i)) will have no state or foreign\nanalog. But the proviso still applies to generic offenses, which\nconstitute nearly half of the entries in the aggravated felony\nlist. See,e.g.,\u00a7\u00a71101(a)(43)(A), (G), (M)(i). And that\nalready-large portion jumps to close to three-quarters of the\noffenses after counting those many listed federal statutes with no\njurisdictional element. See,e.g.,\u00a7\u00a71101(a)(43)(C),\n(E)(ii), (J). In fact, it applies to the vast majority of offenses\nadjudicated under the INA given that most serious crimes are also\n\u201ccrimes of violence.\u201d See \u00a71101(a)(43)(F).[4]And the majority must admit that its\ninterpretation will also leave entries in the aggravated-felony\nsection with no state or foreign analogs. For instance, it seems\nunlikely that the proviso contemplates state analogs for the\naggravated felony provisions regarding treason, levying war against\nthe United States, or disclosing national defense information. See\n\u00a7\u00a71101(a)(43)(L)(i), (P).In other words, under Luna\u2019s reading, the\n\u201cpenultimate sentence\u201d applies to most, but not all, of the entries\nof the aggravated felony statute; under the majority\u2019s reading, the\n\u201cpenultimate sentence\u201d also applies to most, but not all, of the\nentries of the aggravated felony statute. The majority\u2019s first\n\u201ccontextual consideration\u201d thus supplies no reason to prefer one\nreading over the other.BJust as important, the majority suggests, is a\n\u201csettled practice of distinguishing between substantive\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. elements\u201d\u2014those that define \u201cthe evil Congress\nseeks to prevent\u201d\u2014and \u201cjurisdictional element[s],\u201d which merely\n\u201cestablis[h] legislative authority.\u201dAnte,at 15. The\nmajority admits that the Court doesnotdistinguish between\nsubstantive and jurisdictional elements for many purposes, such as\nproof beyond a reasonable doubt and the rightto a jury trial.Ibid.; seeRingv.Arizona, 536 U.\u00a0S.\n584, 606 (2002) . But it nonetheless insists on a standard\ndistinction so entrenched that Congress must have intended it to\napply even absent any particular indication in the INA.None of the three examples that the majority\nproffers is evidence of such a strong norm. First, the majority\ninvokes our rules for interpreting criminal statutes.Ante,at 15\u201316. Whereas our general assumption is that a de-fendant must\nknow each fact making his conduct illegal, courts generally hold\nthat a criminal defendant need not know the facts that satisfy the\njurisdictional element of a statute.But jurisdictional elements are not the only\nelements a defendant need not know. Under the \u201cdefault rule,\u201dante,at 18, n.\u00a012, for interpreting so-called \u201cpublic\nwelfare\u201d offenses, courts have held that a defendant need not know\nthat the substance he possesses is a narcotic, that the device he\npossesses is unregistered, or that he reentered the United States\nafter previously being deported. SeeStaplesv.United\nStates, 511 U.\u00a0S. 600 \u2013609, 611 (1994) (citingUnited\nStatesv.Balint, 258 U.\u00a0S. 250 (1922) , andUnited Statesv.Freed, 401 U.\u00a0S. 601 (1971) );United Statesv.Burwell, 690 F.\u00a03d 500, 508\u2013509\n(CADC 2012);United Statesv.Giambro, 544 F.\u00a03d\n26, 29 (CA1 2008);United Statesv.Martinez-Morel,\n118 F.\u00a03d 710, 715\u2013717 (CA10 1997). But surely the majority\nwould not suggest that if we agree with those holdings regardingmens rea, we must then ignore the \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d\nelement of the drug trafficking aggravated felony, the\n\u201cunregistered\u201d element of the unregistered firearms aggravated\nfelony, or the \u201cfollowing deportation\u201d element of the illegal\nreentry aggravated felony. See 8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7\u00a71101(a)(43)(B), (E)(iii), (M)(i), (O). So there is likewise no\nreason to believe that the \u201cdefault rule\u201d for assigningmens\nreato jurisdictional elements is embedded in the INA.The majority next points to two of the many\nstatutes that, like the INA, require comparing the elements of\nfederal and state offenses. But in each case, it is the statute\u2019s\nlanguage and context, not some \u201csettled practice,\u201dante,at\n15, that command the omission of the jurisdic-tional element.The majority\u2019s first example,ante,at\n16\u201317, is the Assimilative Crimes Act, 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a713(a), a gap-filling statute that incorporates state criminal law\ninto federal enclaves if the \u201cact or omission\u201d is not \u201cmade\npunishable by any enactment of Congress\u201d but \u201cwould be punishable\nif committed or omitted within the jurisdiction of the State.\u201d The\nCourt held that, in identifying such a gap, courts should ignore\n\u201cjurisdictional, or other technical,\u201d differences between a state\nand federal statute.Lewisv.United States, 523\nU.\u00a0S. 155, 165 (1998) . But the way courts match the elements\nof a state law to a federal analog under the Assimilative Crimes\nAct differs fundamentally from our INA inquiry. The basic question\nunder the Assimilative Crimes Act is whether \u201cfederal statutes\nreveal an intent to occupy so much of the field as would exclude\nthe use of the particular state statute at issue.\u201dId.,at\n164. Under the Assimilative Crimes Act, the state statute is not\ncompared to a single federal statute, but rather to a complex of\nfederal statutes that roughly cover the same general conduct and\n\u201cpolicies.\u201dIbid.That statute thus has little to teach us\nabout 8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71101(a)(43): In interpreting the\nAssimilative Crimes Act, every Member of the Court rejected the\nsimple elements-matching approach that the Court generally employs\nto construe the aggravated felony provisions of the INA. See 523\nU.\u00a0S., at 182 (Kennedy, J., dissenting) (allowing \u201cslight\ndifferences\u201d in definition between federal and state statute and\nusing \u201csame-elements inquiry\u201d only as a \u201cstarting point\u201d).The majority\u2019s analogy to the federal three\nstrikes statute, 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73559(c)(2)(F),ante,at 17\u201318, is similarly unhelpful. That provision counts as a\npredicate \u201c\u00a0\u2018serious violent felony\u2019\u00a0\u201d any\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018Federal or State offense .\u00a0.\u00a0.wherever\ncommitted, consisting of\u2019\u00a0\u201d various crimes, including\nseveral \u201c\u00a0\u2018as described in\u2019\u00a0\u201d federal statutes.Ante,at 17. (emphasis added). Though this Court has not\nconstrued the statute, the majority notes that courts of appeals\ndisregard the jurisdictional element of federal statutes in\nassessing whether a state conviction is for a \u201cserious violent\nfelony.\u201dAnte, at 15\u201316. But nearly all of the statutes\nlisted in \u00a73559(c)(2)(F) contain place-based jurisdiction\nelements\u2014the crime must take place \u201cwithin the special maritime and\nterritorial jurisdiction of the United States,\u201de.g.,\u00a71111(b), or within \u201cthe special aircraft jurisdiction of the\nUnited States,\u201d 49 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a746502, and so on. In the two\ncases cited by the majority, for instance,ante,at 17,\nCourts of Appeals concluded that a state robbery offense qualified\nas an offense \u201cdescribed in\u201d the federal bank robbery statute even\nthough the robbery did not take place in a bank. SeeUnited\nStatesv.Wicks, 132 F.\u00a03d 383, 387 (CA7 1997);United Statesv.Rosario-Delgado, 198 F.\u00a03d\n1354, 1357 (CA11 1999). In that statute, it is the \u201cwherever\ncommitted,\u201d not some loose construction of \u201cdescribed in,\u201d that\nspecifically instructs the courts that the location where a crime\noccurs does not matter.Moreover, in other statutes where Congress wants\nto exclude jurisdictional elements when comparing state and federal\noffenses, it ordinarily just says so. See,e.g.,18\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73142(e)(2)(A) (requiring detention of defendant\npending trial if \u201cthe person has been convicted .\u00a0.\u00a0. of\na State or local offense that would have been an offense described\nin subsection (f\u00a0)(1) of this section if a circumstance giving\nrise to Federal jurisdiction had existed\u201d); \u00a72265A(b)(1)(B);\n\u00a72426(b)(1)(B); \u00a73142(f)(1)(D); \u00a75032; 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7\u00a7671(a)(15)(D)(ii)(I)\u2013(II); \u00a7\u00a75106a(b)(2)(B)(xvi)(I)\u2013(II). Absent\ncomparably clear language, the Court should not presume that the\nINA intended deportability to depend on a not-so-\u201csettled\npractice,\u201dante, at 15, of occasionally distinguishing\nbetween substantive and jurisdictional elements.CFinally, the majority suggests that it would\nbe \u201cpeculiarly perverse,\u201dante,at 10, to adopt Luna\u2019s\nplain-text readingof the statute because it would draw a\ndistinction among crimes based on a jurisdictional element that the\nmajority assumes is wholly divorced from \u201cthe evil Congress seeks\nto prevent,\u201dante,at 15. The jurisdictional element of a\nfederal statute, the majority asserts, is as trivial as the\nperfunctory warning on a new electronic device: \u201c[A] person would\nsay that she had followed the instructions for setting up an iPhone\nthat are \u2018described in\u2019 the user\u2019s manual, even if she in fact\nignored the one\u201d instructing that she \u201cbegin by \u2018read[ing]\nimportant safety information.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAnte,at 7, n.\u00a05;\nsee alsoibid.(comparing jurisdictional element to a\n\u201cdetour\u201d in a 3-week itinerary).For instance, the majority assumes that it would\nnot be \u201cplausible,\u201dante,at 12, for Congress to have\nthought that interstate crimes are worse than wholly intrastate\ncrimes. Perhaps. But when faced with an offense that, like arson,\nadmits of a range of conduct, from the minor to the serious,\nCongresscouldplausibly have concluded that arsons\nprosecuted as federal crimes are more uniformly serious than arsons\nprosecuted as state crimes and counted only the former as\naggravated felonies. See,e.g.,Klein et al., Why Federal\nProsecutors Charge: A Comparison of Fed-eral and New York State\nArson and Robbery Filings, 2006\u20132010, 51 Houston L. Rev. 1381,\n1406, 1416\u20131419 (2014) (finding that arsons prosecuted federally\ninvolve more property damage and more injury than arsons prosecuted\nunder state law).That is because, far from being token,\n\u201cconventional jurisdictional elements\u201d serve to narrow the kinds of\ncrimes that can be prosecuted, not just to specify the sovereign\nthat can do the prosecuting. Take the federal statute at issue in\nthis case. Section 844(i) requires that the property destroyed be\n\u201cused in interstate .\u00a0.\u00a0. commerce.\u201d The Court has held\nthat \u201cstandard, jurisdictional\u201d element,ante,at 21,\ndemands the property\u2019s \u201cactive employment for commercial purposes,\nand not merely a passive, passing, or past connection to commerce.\u201dJonesv.United States, 529 U.\u00a0S. 848, 855\n(2000) . As a result, the Court held that a defendant who threw a\nMolotov cocktail through the window of an owner-occupied\nresidential house could not be guilty under \u00a7844(i) because the\nhouse was not \u201cactive[ly] used\u201d in interstate commerce.Id.,\nat 851. Surely, however, a New York prosecutor could have secured a\nconviction under N. Y. Penal Law Ann. \u00a7150.10 had the same crime\nbeen prosecuted in state, rather than federal, court.The difference between an offense under N. Y.\nPenal Law Ann. \u00a7150.10 and an offense under 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7844(i) is thus more than a technical consideration about which\nauthority chooses to prosecute. It is a difference that goes to the\nmagnitude and nature of the \u201cevil,\u201dante,at 15,itself.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*On the majority\u2019s reading, long-time legal\npermanent residents with convictions for minor state offenses are\nforeclosed from even appealing to the mercy of the Attorney\nGeneral. Against our standard method for comparing statutes and the\ntext and structure of the INA, the majority stacks a supposed\nsuperfluity, a not-so-well-settled practice, and its conviction\nthat jurisdictional elements are mere technicalities. But an\nelement is an element, andI would not so lightly strip a federal\nstatute of one. I respectfully dissent.Notes1Many of the majority\u2019s\nown examples of \u201cthe gravest\u201d state offenses supposedly excluded\nfrom the aggravated felony list by Luna\u2019s reading actually fall\nwithin these fail-safe provisions.Ante,at 10. Many state\narsons will qualify as \u201ccrime[s] of violence\u201d under 8\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71101(a)(43)(F), see,e.g., Mbeav.Gonzales, 482 F.\u00a03d 276, 279 (CA4 2007); an even\ngreater fraction of the most serious arsons will fall under that\nheading because States like New York have enacted gra-dated\nstatutes under which more severe degrees of arson are crimes of\nviolence, seeSantana, 714 F.\u00a03d, at 145. To take\nanother of the majority\u2019s examples, while a state conviction for\ndemanding a ransom in a kidnaping is not \u201can offense described in [\n18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7875]\u201d under \u00a71101(a)(43)(H), a state\nconviction for kidnaping or conspiring to kidnap may qualify as a\ncrime of violence under \u00a71101(a)(43)(F). SeeUnited Statesv.Kaplansky, 42 F.\u00a03d 320 (CA6 1994).2Other crimes in the\nmajority\u2019s list of serious offenses,ante,at 10\u201314, will be\ncovered by these separate INA provisions. For example, the Board of\nImmigration Appeals has held that any child pornography offense is\na \u201ccrime involving moral turpitude,\u201d rendering a noncitizen\nremovable in many cases. See \u00a7\u00a71227(a)(2)(A)(i), 1182(a)(2)(A)(i);In reOlquin-Rufino, 23 I.\u00a0&\u00a0N. Dec.\n896 (BIA 2006). Any offense involving a gun would make a noncitizen\ndeportable under one of the catchall provisions for buying,\nselling, or possessing a firearm in violation of \u201cany law.\u201d See\n\u00a71227(a)(2)(C).3If the aggravated felony\nprovisions were the primary mechanism for removing serious\nnoncitizen criminals, we would expectanynoncitizen\nconvicted of an aggravated felony to face immigration consequences.\nIn fact, the aggravated felony provisions only apply to noncitizens\nwho are lawfully admitted or later paroled.Matter of\nAlyazji, 25 I.\u00a0&\u00a0N. Dec. 397, 399 (BIA 2011).\nOther noncitizens\u2014such as undocumented immigrants, noncitizens\napplying for a visa, or some legal permanent residents returning\nafter an extended stay abroad\u2014cannot be removed based on the\nconviction of an aggravated felony; the Government must rely on the\nother provisions of the INA, including the statute\u2019s other criminal\nprovisions, to remove such noncitizens. See \u00a7\u00a71101(a)(13)(A), 1182,\n1227(a)(2)(A)(iii).4When the proviso was\nadded to the INA in 1990, it would have applied to an even greater\nfraction of the aggravated felonies: At that time, the aggravated\nfelony statute listed only five offenses, four of which would have\nhad state analogs even on Luna\u2019s reading. See 104Stat. 5048\n(1990).",
