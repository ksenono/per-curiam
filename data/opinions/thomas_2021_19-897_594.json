JOHNSON, ACTING DIRECTOR OF U.\u00a0S.\nIMMI- GRATION AND CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT, et\u00a0al., PETITIONERSv.MARIA ANGELICA GUZMAN CHAVEZ, et\u00a0al.on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the fourth circuit[June 29, 2021]Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Gorsuch\njoins, concurring except for footnote 4 and concurring in the\njudgment.This Court has an \u201cindependent obligation\u201d to\nassess whether it has jurisdiction.Arbaughv.Y & H\nCorp.,546 U.S.\n500, 514 (2006). We do not have it here.Congress has restricted our jurisdiction in\nremoval cases. See 8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71252(b)(9);Jenningsv.Rodriguez, 583 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2018)\n(Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (slip\nop., at 3). Under \u00a71252(b)(9), we can exercise judicial review of\n\u201cquestions of law and fact . . . arising from any action taken or\nproceeding brought to remove an alien\u201d in only two circumstances.\nOne is to review a final order of removal. \u00a71252(b)(9). The other\nis to exercise an express grant of jurisdiction elsewhere in \u00a71252.Ibid.;Jennings, 583 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at\n3). Neither circumstance is present here.Therefore, if respondents\u2019 claims \u201caris[e] from\nany action taken or proceeding brought to remove an alien,\u201d the\njurisdictional bar in \u00a71252(b)(9) applies. And for all the reasons\nI discussed inJennings, challenges to detention during the\nremoval process, such as this one, \u201cfall within the heartland of\n\u00a71252(b)(9).\u201dId., at ___ (slip op., at 5).AlthoughJenningsconcerned aliens whom\nthe Government had not yet ordered removed whereas the aliens here\nhave removal orders reinstated against them, the result does not\nchange. Section 1252(b)(9) \u201ccover[s] all claims related to removal\nproceedings.\u201dNasrallahv.Barr, 590 U.\u00a0S. ___,\n___, n.\u00a02 (2020) (Thomas, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 4, n.\n2) (internal quotation marks omitted). That includes claims arising\nafter final orders of removal are issued, such as\nwithholding-of-removal claims. Seeid.,at ___\u2013___ (slip\nop., at 3\u20134). And it includes claims like the ones here, which\ninvolve a part \u201cof the deportation process that necessarily\nserve[s] the purpose of ensuring an alien\u2019s removal.\u201dJennings, 583 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 5).In light of this jurisdictional problem, the\nCourt should vacate and remand with instructions to dismiss for\nlack of jurisdiction. But \u201cbecause the Court has held that we have\njurisdiction in cases like these\u201d and the Court\u2019s opinion is\notherwise correct, I join it except for footnote four. SeeNielsenv.Preap, 586 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2019)\n(Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (slip\nop., at 1).",
