    "text": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES_________________No. 14\u20136368_________________MICHAEL B. KINGSLEY, PETITIONERv.STANHENDRICKSON, et\u00a0al.on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the seventh circuit[June 22, 2015]Justice Alito, dissenting.I would dismiss this case as improvidently\ngranted. Before deciding what a pretrial detainee must show in\norder to prevail on a due process excessive force claim, we should\ndecide whether a pretrial detainee can bring a Fourth Amendment\nclaim based on the use of excessive force by a detention facility\nemployee. We have not yet decided that question. SeeGrahamv.Connor, 490 U.\u00a0S. 386 , n.\u00a010 (1989). If a\npretrial detainee can bring such a claim, we need not and should\nnot rely on substantive due process. SeeAlbrightv.Oliver, 510 U.\u00a0S. 266, 273 (1994) (plurality opinion);Graham, 490 U.\u00a0S.,at 395. It is settled that\nthe test for an unreasonable seizure under the Fourth Amendment is\nobjective, seeid.,at 397, so if a pretrial detainee can\nbring such a claim, it apparently would be indistinguishable from\nthe substantive due process claim that the Court discusses.I would not decide the due process issue\npresented in this case until the availability of a Fourth Amendment\nclaim is settled, and I would therefore dismiss this case as\nimprovidently granted.",
