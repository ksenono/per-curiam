A legion of\nacademics, lower court judges, and Members of this Court\u2014evenAuer\u2019s author\u2014has called on us to abandonAuer. Yet\ntoday a bare majority flinches, andAuerlives on.Still, today\u2019s decision is more a stay of\nexecution than a pardon. The Court cannot muster even five votes to\nsay thatAueris lawful or wise. Instead, a majority retainsAueronly because ofstare decisis. And yet, far from\nstanding by that precedent, the majority proceeds to impose so many\nnew and nebulous qualifications and limitations onAuerthat\nThe Chief Justice claims to see little practical difference between\nkeeping it on life support in this way and overruling it entirely.\nSo the doctrine emerges maimed and enfeebled\u2014in truth,\nzombified.Respectfully, we owe our colleagues on the lower\ncourts more candid and useful guidance than this. And judges owe\nthe people who come before them nothing less than a fair contest,\nwhere every party has an equal chance to persuade the court of its\ninterpretation of the law\u2019s demands. One can hope that The Chief\nJustice is right, and that whether we formally overruleAueror merely neuter it, the results in most cases will prove the same.\nBut means, not just ends, matter, and retaining even this\ndebilitated version ofAuerthreatens to force litigants and\nlower courts to jump through needless and perplexing new hoops and\nin the process deny the people the independent judicial decisions\nthey deserve. All to what end? So that we maypretendto\nabidestare decisis?Consider this case. Mr. Kisor is a Marine who\nlost out on benefits for post-traumatic stress disorder when the\ncourt of appeals deferred to a regulatory interpretation advanced\nby the Department of Veterans Affairs. The court of appeals was\nguilty of nothing more than faithfully followingAuer. But\nthe majority today invokesstare decisis, of all things, to\nvacate that judgment and tell the court of appeals to try again\nusing its newly retooled, multi-factored, and far less determinate\nversion ofAuer. Respectfully, I would stop this business of\nmaking up excuses for judges to abdicate their job of interpreting\nthe law, and simply allow the court of appeals to afford Mr. Kisor\nits best independent judgment of the law\u2019s meaning.The Court\u2019s failure to be done withAuer,\nand its decision to adornAuerwith so many new and\nambiguous limitations, all but guarantees we will have to pass this\nway again. When that day comes, I hope this Court will find the\nnerve it lacks today and interAuerat last. Until then, I\nhope that our judicial colleagues on other courts will take courage\nfrom today\u2019s ruling and realize that it has transformedAuerinto a paper tiger.I. How We Got HereWhere didAuercome from? Not from the\nConstitution, some ancient common law tradition, or even a modern\nstatute. Instead, it began as an unexplained aside in a decision\nabout emergency price controls at the height of the Second World\nWar. Even then, the dictum sat on the shelf, little noticed, for\nyears. Only in the last few decades of the 20th century did lawyers\nand courts really begin to dust it off and shape it into the\nreflexive rule of deference to regulatory agencies we know today.\nAnd they did so without ever pausing to consider whether a rule\nlike that could be legally justified or even made sense.Aueris really little more than an accident.ABefore the mid-20th century, few federal\nagencies engaged in extensive rulemaking, and those that did rarely\nsought deference for their regulatory interpretations.[3] But when the question arose, this\nCourt did not hesitate to say that judges reviewing administrative\naction should decide all questions of law, including questions\nconcerning the meaning of regulations. As Justice Brandeis put it,\n\u201c[t]he inexorable safeguard which the due process clause assures is\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. that there will be opportunity for a court to\ndetermine whether the applicable rules of law .\u00a0.\u00a0. were\nobserved.\u201d[4] Unsurprisingly,\nthe government\u2019s early, longstanding, and consistent interpretation\nof a statute, regulation, or other legal instrument could count as\npowerfulevidenceof its original public meaning.[5] But courts respected executive\ninterpretations only because and to the extent \u201cthey embodied\nunderstandings made roughly contemporaneously with .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nenactment and stably maintained and practiced since that time,\u201d not\n\u201cbecause they were executive as such.\u201d[6]Writing for four Members of the Court, Justice\nKagan suggests thatAuer\u2019s very different approach to the\ninterpretation of agency regulations was foreshadowed as early as\nthis Court\u2019s 1898 decision inUnited Statesv.Eaton.[7]Ante,\nat 7. But this is mistaken. The question in that case was whether\nMr. Eaton\u2019s appointment as temporary vice-consul to Siam was\nconsistent with State Department regulations. After several pages\nof careful and independent legal analysis, the Court held that the\nregulations did authorize the appointment. That conclusion, the\nCourt explained, was \u201crendered necessary by a consideration of the\ntext.\u201d[8] Onlyafterreaching this conclusion did the Court observe that the State\nDepartment had previously adopted the same construction, noting\nalong the way that the Department\u2019s views were \u201centitled to the\ngreatest weight\u201d and that the Court saw \u201cno reason in this case to\ndoubt [their] correctness.\u201d[9]Eatonthus simply followed the well-worn path of\nacknowledging that an agency\u2019s interpretation of a regulation can\nsupplyevidenceof its meaning.[10] Nowhere did the Court even hint that it would have\ndeferred to the State Department\u2019s views about the meaning of the\nlaw if its own independent textual analysis had not led it to the\nsame conclusion.All this is borne out by the Court\u2019s later\nteachings inSkidmorev.Swift & Co.in\n1944.[11] The question there\nwas whether the time overnight employees spent waiting to respond\nto fire alarms could amount to compensable overtime under the Fair\nLabor Standards Act. The lower courts had held as a matter of law\nthat it could not. In an opinion by Justice Jackson, this Court\nreversed. The Court first held, based on its own independent\nanalysis, that \u201cno principle of law found either in the statute or\nin Court decisions precludes waiting time from also being working\ntime.\u201d[12] Only then did the\nCourt consider \u201cwhat, if any, deference courts should pay\u201d to the\nviews of the Administrator of the Labor Department\u2019s Wage and Hour\nDivision.[13] And on that\nquestion the Court reaffirmed the traditional rule that an agency\u2019s\ninterpretation of the law is \u201cnot controlling upon the courts\u201d and\nis entitled only to a weight proportional to \u201cthe thoroughness\nevident in its consideration, the validity of its reasoning, its\nconsistency with earlier and later pronouncements, and all those\nfactors which give it power to persuade.\u201d[14] At the time, the influential administrative law\nscholar Kenneth Culp Davis considered this \u201c[a]n entirely reliable\nstatement\u201d of the law.[15]BIn truth, the seeds of theAuerdoctrine were first planted only in 1945, inBowlesv.Seminole Rock & Sand Co.[16] That case involved regulations issued by the Office\nof Price Administration (OPA), which Congress had tasked with\nstabilizing the national economy during the Second World War\nthrough the use of emergency price controls. It was in that context\nthat the Court declared\u2014for the first time and without citing any\nauthority\u2014that \u201cif the meaning of [the regulation were] in doubt,\u201d\nthe agency\u2019s interpretation would merit \u201ccontrolling weight unless\nit is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the\nregulation.\u201d[17]Yet even then it was far from clear how much\nweight the Court really placed on the agency\u2019s interpretation. As\nit had inEaton, the Court inSeminole Rockbegan\nwith an extended discussion of \u201cthe plain words of the regulation,\u201d\nwhich led it to conclude that the text \u201cclearly\u201d supported the\ngovernment\u2019s position.[18]\nOnly after reaching that conclusion based on its own independent\nanalysis did the Court proceed to add that \u201c[a]ny doubts\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. are removed by reference to the administrative\nconstruction.\u201d[19]So confused was all this that readers at the\ntime didn\u2019t perceiveSeminole Rock\u2019s dictum as changing\nanything. Professor Davis observed that the Court\u2019s discussion\nabout giving \u201ccontrolling weight\u201d to the agency\u2019s interpretation\nwas an unexplained aside that made no difference to the case\u2019s\noutcome.[20] The dictum,\ntoo, was readily explained as reflecting the unusual factual\ncontext in which the case arose, involving an emergency government\nprogram created to deal with \u201cunique circumstances of war and\neconomic depression.\u201d[21]\nAnd the Court decidedSeminole Rockthe same Term it issuedSkidmore, where it reaffirmed the traditional rule that an\nagency\u2019s views about the law maypersuadea court but can\nnevercontrolits judgment. In fact, the Court inSeminole Rockwas careful to note that the OPA\ninterpretation before it bore many of the characteristicsSkidmorewould have recognized as increasing its persuasive\nforce: It had been announced concurrently with the regulation,\ndisseminated widely to the regulated community, and adhered to\nconsistently by the agency.[22]No wonder, then, that for many years after the\ndecision, courts \u201cconnectedSeminole Rockmore closely with\nthe deference framework .\u00a0.\u00a0. underSkidmore\u201d and\ngenerally engaged in aSkidmore-type analysis, accepting the\nagency\u2019s interpretation \u201conly after independently examining the\nregulation and concluding that the agency interpretation was\nsound.\u201d[23] IfSeminole\nRock\u2019s \u201ccontrolling weight\u201d dictum was afforded any force, it\nwas usually only in the price control context; even then it was\nordinarily extended only to \u201cofficial\u201d agency interpretations that\nwere published contemporaneously with the regulation and widely\ndistributed.[24] The Fourth\nCircuit exemplified the early understanding ofSeminole Rockwhen it observed\u2014citing bothSeminole RockandSkidmore\u2014that \u201cunder settled principles\u201d an official agency\ninterpretation in an opinion letter was entitled only to\n\u201crespectful consideration.\u201d[25] The letter, the court stressed, did not \u201chave the\neffect of law,\u201d and \u201c[i]t would be absurd to hold that the courts\nmust subordinate their judgment as to the meaning of a\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. regulation to the mere unsupported opinion of an\nassociate counsel in an administrative department.\u201d[26]CThis Court did not citeSeminole Rock\u2019s\n\u201ccontrolling weight\u201d dictum again until 1965, inUdallv.Tallman.[27] And\nthoughTallman\u201cdid very little to advance the\njurisprudential understanding ofSeminole Rock,\u201d it\ncertainly helped fuel the expansion of so-called \u201cSeminole\nRockdeference.\u201d[28]\nFrom the 1960s on, this Court and lower courts began to cite theSeminole Rockdictum with increasing frequency and in a\nwider variety of circumstances, but still without much explanation.\nThey also increasingly divorcedSeminole RockfromSkidmore.[29]Auerrepresents the apotheosis of this\nline of cases. In the name of what some now call theAuerdoctrine, courts have in recent years \u201cmechanically applied and\nreflexively treated\u201dSeminole Rock\u2019s dictum \u201cas a constraint\nupon the careful inquiry that one might ordinarily expect of courts\nengaged in textual analysis.\u201d[30] UnderAuer, judges are forced to subordinate\ntheir own views about what the law means to those of a political\nactor, one who may even be a party to the litigation before the\ncourt. After all, if the court agrees that the agency\u2019s reading is\nthe best one,Auerdoes no real work; the doctrine matters\nonly when a court would conclude that the agency\u2019s interpretation\nisnotthe best or fairest reading of the regulation.To be sure, Justice Kagan paints a very\ndifferent picture ofAuer, asking us to imagine it riding to\nthe rescue only in cases where the scales of justice are evenly\nbalanced between two equally persuasive readings. But that\u2019s a\nfantasy: \u201cIf nature knows of such equipoise in legal arguments, the\ncourts at least do not.\u201d[31]\nIn the real world the judge uses his traditional interpretive\ntoolkit, full of canons and tiebreaking rules, to reach a decision\nabout the best and fairest reading of the law. Of course, there are\nclose cases and reasonable judges will sometimes disagree. But\nevery day, in courts throughout this country, judges manage with\nthese traditional tools to reach conclusions about the meaning of\nstatutes, rules of procedure, contracts, and the Constitution. Yet\nwhen it comes to interpreting federal regulations,Auerdisplaces this process and requires judges instead to treat the\nagency\u2019s interpretation as controlling even when it is \u201cnot\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. the best one.\u201d[32]If that were not troubling enough,Auerhas also become \u201ca doctrine of uncertain scope and\napplication.\u201d[33] This Court\nhas never offered meaningful guidance on how to decide whether the\nagency\u2019s reading is \u201creasonable\u201d enough to demand judicial\ndeference\u2014and lower courts have drawn that line in wildly different\nplaces.[34] Deepening the\nconfusion, this Court and lower courts have, over time, tried to\nsoftenAuer\u2019s rigidity by declaring that it \u201cmight\u201d not\napply in some ill-defined circumstances, such as when the agency\u2019s\ninterpretation \u201cconflicts with a prior interpretation\u201d or reflects\na \u201cconvenient litigating position\u201d or a \u201cpost\u00a0hocrationalization\u201d for past agency action.[35] All this has resulted in \u201cwidespread confusion\u201d\nabout when and how to applyAuerdeference.[36]In light ofAuer\u2019s many problems, it\nshould come as no surprise that several Members of this\nCourt,[37] along with a\ngreat many lower court judges[38] and members of the legal academy,[39] have questionedAuer\u2019s validity\nand pleaded with this Court to reconsider it.DThat\u2019s where things stood when James Kisor\nasked the Department of Veterans Affairs to reopen his disability\nbenefits claim. Mr. Kisor served as a United States Marine from\n1962 through 1966 and saw combat in Vietnam. In the early 1980s, a\nVA counselor observed that Mr. Kisor was battling depression and\nsuicidal thoughts and suggested he might be suffering from\npost-traumatic stress disorder. In light of this, Mr. Kisor filed a\nclaim for disability benefits in 1982. But, in the end, the VA\ndenied the claim.In 2006, Mr. Kisor sought to reopen the matter.\nIn connection with that request, he presented new evidence,\nincluding a psychiatrist\u2019s report diagnosing him with PTSD and\nadditional records documenting his service in Vietnam. The VA\nreopened Mr. Kisor\u2019s claim and granted him disability benefits\neffective June 5, 2006, the date he had submitted his new request.\nMr. Kisor argued that a VA regulation entitled him to an earlier\neffective date for disability benefits, one tracing back to his\noriginal submission in 1982. But the Board of Veterans Appeals\nconcluded that the applicable regulation didn\u2019t authorize that\nrelief.Mr. Kisor appealed the Board\u2019s ruling all the\nway to the Federal Circuit, arguing that the Board had\nmisinterpreted the relevant regulation. The Federal Circuit\naffirmed. Relying on theAuerdoctrine, the court held that\nit had no choice but to treat the Board\u2019s interpretation as\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018controlling\u2019\u00a0\u201d unless that interpretation was\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the\nregulatio[n].\u2019\u00a0\u201d[40]\nWithout even trying to determine who had the better reading of the\nregulation, the Board or Mr. Kisor, the court declared that \u201c[t]he\nBoard\u2019s interpretation does not strike us as either plainly\nerroneous or inconsistent with the VA\u2019s regulatory\nframework.\u201d[41] Case\nclosed.Mr. Kisor sought and was denied rehearing en\nbanc. Three judges dissented and joined those who have questioned\n\u201cthe logic behind continued adherence to the [Auer]\ndoctrine\u201d; they argued that, withoutAuerdeference, Mr.\nKisor\u2019s reading of the regulation would likely prevail.[42] Mr. Kisor then asked us to grant\ncertiorari to reconsiderAuer. Thinking it past time to do\nso, we granted the petition.[43]II. The Administrative Procedure ActWhen this Court speaks about the rules\ngoverning judicial review of federal agency action, we are not (or\nshouldn\u2019t be) writing on a blank slate or exercising some\ncommon-law-making power. We are supposed to be applying the\nAdministrative Procedure Act. The APA is a \u201cseminal\u201d statute that\nCongress wrote to define the relationship between courts and\nagencies.[44] Some have even\ndescribed it as a kind of constitution for our \u201cadministrative\nstate.\u201d Yet, remarkably, until today this Court has never made any\nserious effort to square theAuerdoctrine with the APA.\nEven now, only four Justices make the attempt. And for at least two\nreasons, their arguments are wholly unpersuasive.AThe first problem lies in \u00a7706. That provision\ninstructs reviewing courts to \u201cdecide all relevant questions of\nlaw\u201d and \u201cset aside agency action .\u00a0.\u00a0. found to be\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. not in accordance with law.\u201d[45] Determining the meaning of a statute or\nregulation, of course, presents a classic legal question. But in\ncase these directives were not clear enough, the APA further\ndirects courts to \u201cdetermine the meaning\u201d of any relevant \u201cagency\naction,\u201d including any rule issued by the agency.[46] The APA thus requires a reviewing court\nto resolve for itself any dispute over the proper interpretation of\nan agency regulation. A court that, in deference to an agency,\nadopts something other than the best reading of a regulation isn\u2019t\n\u201cdecid[ing]\u201d the relevant \u201cquestio[n] of law\u201d or \u201cdetermin[ing] the\nmeaning\u201d of the regulation. Instead, it\u2019s allowing the agency to\ndictate the answer to that question. In doing so, the court is\nabdicating the duty Congress assigned to it in the APA.[47]Justice Kagan seeks to address the glaring\ninconsistency between our judge-made rule and the controlling\nstatute this way. On her account, the APA tells a reviewing court\nto \u201cdetermine the meaning\u201d of regulations, but it does not tell the\ncourt \u201chow\u201d to do that. Thus, we are told, reading the\nregulation for itself and deferring to the agency\u2019s reading are\njust two equally valid ways for a court to fulfill its statutory\nduty to \u201cdetermine the meaning\u201d of the regulation.Ante, at\n20\u201321.But the APA isn\u2019t as anemic as that. Its\nunqualified command requires the court to determine legal\nquestions\u2014including questions about a regulation\u2019s meaning\u2014by its\nown lights, not by those of political appointees or bureaucrats who\nmay even be self-interested litigants in the case at hand. Nor can\nthere be any doubt that, when Congress wrote the APA, it knew\nperfectly well how to require judicial deference to an agency when\nit wished\u2014in fact, Congress repeatedly specified deferential\nstandards for judicial reviewelsewherein the\nstatute.[48] But when it\ncomes to the business of interpreting regulations, no such command\nexists; instead, Congress told courts to \u201cdetermine\u201d those matters\nfor themselves. Though one hardly needs to be an academic to\nrecognize the point, \u201ccommentators in administrative law have\n\u2018generally acknowledged\u2019 that Section 706 seems to require\nde\u00a0novo review on questions of law.\u201d[49]What the statutory language suggests, experience\nconfirms. IfAuerdeference were really just another way for\ncourts to \u201cdetermine the meaning\u201d of regulations under \u00a7706, you\nmight expect that a final judicial \u201cdetermination\u201d would at least\nsettle, as a matter of precedent, the question of what the\nregulation \u201cmeans.\u201d Of course, even after one court has spoken on a\nregulation\u2019s meaning, that court or another might properly give\nweight to a new agency interpretation as part of the court\u2019s own\ndecision-making process. Seesupra, at 6. But in light ofNational Cable & Telecommunications Assn.v.Brand X\nInternet Services,[50]\ncourts have interpretedAueras forbidding a court from ever\n\u201cdetermin[ing] the meaning\u201d of a regulation with the force that\nnormally attaches to precedent, because an agency is always free to\nadopt a different view and insist on judicial deference to its new\njudgment.[51] And if an\nagency can not only control the court\u2019s initial decision but also\nrevoke that decision at any time, how can anyone honestly say the\ncourt, rather than the agency, ever really \u201cdetermine[s]\u201d what the\nregulation means?To test the point further, consider a statute\nthat tells a court to \u201cdetermin[e]\u201d an appropriate sentence in a\ncriminal case.[52] If the\njudge said he was sending a defendant to prison for longer than he\nbelieved appropriate only in deference to the government\u2019s\n\u201creasonable\u201d sentencing recommendation, would anyone really think\nthat complied with the law? Or take a statute that instructs a\ncourt to \u201cdetermine\u201d whether a consent judgment proposed by the\ngovernment in a civil antitrust case \u201cis in the public\ninterest.\u201d[53] If a court\nthought the proposed judgment harmful to the public but decided to\ndefer to the government\u2019s \u201creasonable\u201d contrary view anyway, would\nanyone suggest the court had complied with Congress\u2019s\ninstruction?Nor does Justice Kagan\u2019s reading of \u00a7706 offer\nany logical stopping point. If courts can \u201cdetermine the meaning\u201d\nof a regulation by deferring to any \u201creasonable\u201d agency reading,\nthen why not by deferring toanyagency reading? If it were\nreally true that the APA has nothing to say abouthowcourts\ndecide what regulations mean, then it would follow that the APA\ntolerates a rule that \u201cthe agency is always right.\u201d And if you find\nyourself in a place as absurd as that, you might want to consider\nwhether you\u2019ve taken a wrong turn along the way.BThe problems don\u2019t end there.Aueris\nalso incompatible with the APA\u2019s instructions in \u00a7553. That\nprovision requires agencies to follow notice-and-comment procedures\nwhen issuing or amending legally binding regulations (what the APA\ncalls \u201csubstantive rules\u201d), but not when offering mere\ninterpretations of those regulations.[54] An agency wishing to adopt or amend a binding\nregulation thus must publish a proposal in the Federal Register,\ngive interested members of the public an opportunity to submit\nwritten comments on the proposal, and consider those comments\nbefore issuing the final regulation. Under the APA, that regulation\nthen carries the force of law unless and until it is amended or\nrepealed.[55] By contrast,\nan agency can announce an interpretation of an existing substantive\nregulation without advance warning and in pretty much whatever form\nit chooses.Auereffectively nullifies the\ndistinction Congress drew here. UnderAuer, courts must\ntreat as \u201ccontrolling\u201d not only an agency\u2019s duly promulgated rules\nbut also its mere interpretations\u2014even ones that appear only in a\nlegal brief, press release, or guidance document issued without\naffording the public advance notice or a chance to comment. For all\npractical purposes, \u201cthe new interpretation might as well be a new\nregulation.\u201d[56]Auerthus oblit- erates a distinction Congress thought vital and\nsupplies agencies with a shortcut around the APA\u2019s required\nprocedures for issuing and amending substantive rules that bind the\npublic with the full force and effect of law.[57]Think of it this way. We\u2019ve held that the\nConstitution\u2019s specification of a \u201csingle, finely wrought\u201d\nprocedure for the enactment of statutes (bicameralism and\npresentment) necessarily implies that Congress cannot amend an\nenacted statute without following that procedure\u2014say, by allowing a\nsingle House to change what the law requires.[58] By the same logic, Congress\u2019s specification\nin the APA of procedures for the creation of new substantive rules\n(like notice and comment) necessarily implies that an agency cannot\namend a substantive rule without following those procedures. To\nhold otherwise, asAuerdemands, subverts the APA\u2019s\ndesign.Certainamicicontend this argument is\n\u201cout of place\u201d in this particular case because the VA happened to\nissue the interpretation challenged here in an adjudicative\nproceeding.[59] But the\npremise on which they proceed\u2014that the APA permits agencies to\nissue \u201ccontrolling\u201d amendments to their regulations in adjudicative\nproceedings\u2014is not correct. Once an agency issues a substantive\nrule through notice and comment, it can amend that rule only by\nfollowing the same notice-and-comment procedures.[60] Whether an agency issues its\ninterpretation in a press release or something it chooses to call\nan \u201cadjudication,\u201d all we have is the agency\u2019s opinion about what\nan existing rule means, something that the APA tells us isnotbinding in a court of law or on the American people.If that won\u2019t work, Justice Kagan tries an\nalternative argument from nearly the opposite direction. She\nreplies that affordingAuerdeference to an agency\u2019s\ninterpretation of its own rules never offends the APA because the\nagency\u2019s interpretation lacks \u201cthe force of law\u201d associated with\nsubstantive rules. Agency interpretations lack this force, we are\ntold, because a court always retains the power to decide at least\nwhether the interpretation is entitled to deference.Ante,\nat 22\u201323. But this argument rests on an implausibly narrow\nunderstanding of what it means for an agency action to bear the\nforce of law. Under Justice Kagan\u2019s logic, even a binding\nsubstantive rule would lack the force of law because a court\nretains the power to decide whether the rule is arbitrary and\ncapricious and thus invalid under the APA. But no one believes\nthat. While an agency interpretation, just like a substantive rule,\n\u201cmust meet certain conditions before it gets deference,\u201d \u201conce it\ndoes so [Auermakes it] every bit as binding as a\nsubstantive rule.\u201d[61] To\nsuggest thatAuerdoes not make an agency\u2019s interpretive\nguidance \u201cbinding o[n] anyone,\u201dante, at 23, is linguistic\nhocus-pocus.CIfAuercannot be squared with the text\nof the APA, Justice Kagan suggests it at least conforms to a\nreason- able \u201cpresumption about congressional intent.\u201dAnte,\nat 7. The theory seems to be that whenever Congress grants an\nagency \u201crulemaking power,\u201d italsoimplicitly gives the\nagency \u201c\u00a0\u2018the power authoritatively to interpret\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nwhatever rules the agency chooses to adopt.Ante, at 8. But\nagainst the clear statutory commands Congress gave us in the APA,\nwhat sense does it make to \u201cpresume\u201d that Congress really,\nsecretly, wanted courts to treat agency interpretations as binding?\nNormally, this Court does not allow hidden legislative intentions\nto \u201cmuddy\u201d such plainly expressed statutory directives.[62]Even on its own terms, too, this argument proves\npretty muddy. It goes something like this: The drafters of the APA\ndid not intend to \u201c\u00a0\u2018significantly alter\u2019\u00a0\u201d established\nlaw governing judicial review of agency action as of 1946; theAuerdoctrine was part of that established law; therefore,\nthe APA implicitly requires courts to afford agenciesAuerdeference.Ante, at 21\u201322. But neither of this syllogism\u2019s\nessential premises stands on solid ground.Take the major premise\u2014that those who adopted\nthe APA intended to work no change in the established law of\njudicial review of agency action. Justice Kagan is right, of\ncourse, that Attorney General Clark claimed as much shortly after\nthe APA\u2019s passage.Ante, at 21. But his view, which\nreflected the interests of the executive branch, was far from\nuniversally shared. Others, including many members of Congress,\nthought the APA would clarify, if not expand, the scope of judicial\nreview. For example, Senator McCarran, the Chairman of the\nJudiciary Committee, wrote that it would be \u201chard .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nfor anyone to argue that this Act did anything other than cut down\nthe \u2018cult of discretion\u2019 so far as federal law is\nconcerned.\u201d[63] And both the\nHouse and Senate reports on the APA said it was intended to\n\u201cprovid[e] that questions of law are for courts rather than\nagencies to decide in the last analysis.\u201d[64]Just five years after the APA\u2019s passage, this\nCourt seemed to side with those who thought the APA was intended to\ndo more than just summarize existing law. In an opinion by Justice\nFrankfurter, the Court opined that the APA required courts to\nassume \u201cmoreresponsibility\u201d for reviewing agency decisions\n\u201cthan some courts ha[d] shown in the past.\u201d[65] One early commentator likewise observed that\nthe APA seemed designed to eliminate all doubt that questions of\nlaw \u201cshall be decided by the reviewing Court for itself, and in the\nexercise of its own independent judgment\u201d; \u201c[m]ore explicit words\nto impose this mandate,\u201d he thought, \u201ccould hardly be\nfound.\u201d[66]Justice Kagan\u2019s syllogism runs into even more\ntrouble with its minor premise\u2014that theAuerdoctrine was a\nwell-established part of the common law background when Congress\nenacted the APA in 1946. As we\u2019ve seen, this Court planted the\nseeds ofAuerdeference for the first time in dictum inSeminole Rock, just a year before Congress passed the APA.\nSee Part I\u2013B,supra. And that dictum did not somehow\nimmediately become an entrenched part of the common law: For years\nfollowingSeminole Rock, courts and \u201ccommentators largely\nignored\u201d it,[67] and those\nwho took notice weren\u2019t sure what to make of it. Professor Davis,\nfor example, doubted that the dictum could be \u201ctaken at face value\u201d\ngiven that it seemed \u201cirreconcilable\u201d with the Court\u2019s approach in\nother cases.[68] In truth,\nwhen Congress passed the APA the law of judicial review of agency\naction was in a confused state. During the congressional hearings\non the bill, one witness\u2019s suggestion that Congress should leave\nthe scope of judicial review \u201cas it now is\u201d drew this fair reply\nfrom Representative Walter, chairman of the House Subcommittee on\nAdministrative Law and author of the House Report on the APA: \u201cYou\nsay \u2018as it now is.\u2019 Frankly, I do not know what it now is\n.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. [T]he Supreme Court apparently changes its\nmind daily.\u201d[69]III. The ConstitutionNot only isAuerincompatible with the\nAPA; it also sits uneasily with the Constitution. Article III, \u00a71\nprovides that the \u201cjudicial Power of the United States\u201d is vested\nexclusively in this Court and the lower federal courts. A core\ncomponent of that judicial power is \u201c\u00a0\u2018the duty of\ninterpreting [the laws] and applying them in cases properly brought\nbefore the courts.\u2019\u00a0\u201d[70] As Chief Justice Marshall put it, \u201c[i]t is\nemphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to\nsay what the law is.\u201d[71]\nAnd never, this Court has warned, should the \u201cjudicial power\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. be shared with [the] Executive Branch.\u201d[72] Yet that seems to be exactly\nwhatAuerrequires.AOur Nation\u2019s founders were painfully aware of\nthe dangers of executive and legislative intrusion on judicial\ndecision-making. One of the abuses of royal power that led to the\nAmerican Revolution was King George\u2019s attempt to gain influence\nover colonial judges.[73]\nColonial legislatures, too, had interfered with the courts\u2019\nindependence \u201cat the behest of private interests and\nfactions.\u201d[74] These\nexperiences had taught the founders that \u201c\u00a0\u2018there is no\nliberty if the power of judgment be not separated from the\nlegislative and executive powers.\u2019\u00a0\u201d[75] They knew that when political actors are left free\nnot only to adopt and enforce written laws, but also to control the\ninterpretation of those laws, the legal rights of \u201clitigants with\nunpopular or minority causes or .\u00a0.\u00a0. who belong to\ndespised or suspect classes\u201d count for little.[76] Maybe the powerful, well-heeled, popular,\nand connected can wheedle favorable outcomes from a system like\nthat\u2014but what about everyone else? They are left always a little\nunsure what the law is, at the mercy of political actors and the\nshifting winds of popular opinion, and without the chance for a\nfair hearing before a neutral judge. The rule of law begins to\nbleed into the rule of men.Experiencing all this in their own time, the\nfounders sought to ensure that those who came after them would not.\nBelieving that \u201c[n]o maxim was better established\u201d than \u201cthat the\npower of making ought to be kept distinct from that of expounding,\nthe laws,\u201d[77] they designed\na judiciary that would be able to interpret the laws \u201cfree from\npotential domination by other branches of government.\u201d[78] To that end, they resisted\nproposals that would have subjected judicial decisions to review by\npolitical actors.[79] And\nthey rejected the British tradition of using the upper house of the\nlegislature as a court of last resort, out of fear that a body with\n\u201ceven a partial agency in passing bad laws\u201d would operate under the\n\u201csame spirit\u201d in \u201cinterpreting them.\u201d[80] Instead, they gave federal judges life tenure,\nsubject only to removal by impeachment; and they guaranteed that\nthe other branches could not reduce judges\u2019 compensation so long as\nthey remained in office.The founders afforded these extraordinary powers\nand protections not for the comfort of judges, but so that an\nindependent judiciary could better guard the people from the\narbitrary use of governmental power. And sitting atop the judicial\nbranch, this Court has always carried a special duty to \u201cjealously\nguar[d]\u201d the Constitution\u2019s promise of judicial\nindependence.[81] So we have\nlong resisted any effort by the other branches to \u201c\u00a0\u2018usurp a\ncourt\u2019s power to interpret and apply the law to the circumstances\nbefore it.\u2019\u00a0\u201d[82] The\njudicial power to interpret the law, this Court has held, \u201ccan no\nmore be shared with another branch than the Chief Executive, for\nexample, can share with the Judiciary the veto power, or the\nCongress share with the Judiciary the power to override a\nPresidential veto.\u201d[83]Auerrepresents no trivial threat to\nthese foundational principles. Under the APA, substantive rules\nissued by federal agencies through notice-and-comment procedures\nbear \u201cthe \u2018force and effect of law\u2019\u00a0\u201d[84] and are part of the body of federal law,\nbinding on private individuals, that the Constitution charges\nfederal judges with interpreting. YetAuertells the judge\nthat he must interpret these binding laws to mean not what he\nthinks they mean, but what an executive agency says they mean.\nUnlike Article III judges, executive officials are not, nor are\nthey supposed to be, \u201cwholly impartial.\u201d[85] They have their own interests, their own\nconstituencies, and their own policy goals\u2014and when interpreting a\nregulation, they may choose to \u201cpress the case for the side [they]\nrepresen[t]\u201d instead of adopting the fairest and best\nreading.[86]Auerthus means that, far from being \u201ckept distinct,\u201d the powers of\nmaking, enforcing, and interpreting laws are united in the same\nhands\u2014and in the process a cornerstone of the rule of law is\ncompromised.Consider an analogy. The Court has long held\nthat Congress cannot \u201c\u00a0\u2018indirectly control the action of the\ncourts, by requiring of them a construction of the law according to\nits own views.\u2019\u00a0\u201d[87]\nIf Congress disagrees with how courts are interpreting an existing\nstatute, it is free to amend the statute to establish a different\nrule going forward. What it cannot do is issue \u201ca mandate\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. to compel the courts to construe and apply\n[existing law], not according to the judicial, but according to the\nlegislative judgment.\u201d[88]\nAs early as 1804, when a lawyer argued before this Court that an\nAct of the North Carolina legislature could not control the Court\u2019s\nconstruction of an earlier North Carolina statute because \u201c[t]o\ndeclare what the law is, or has been, is a judicial power,\u201d not a\nlegislative power, the Court stopped him, deeming the point too\nplain for argument.[89]But if the legislature can\u2019t control a judge\u2019s\ninterpretation of an existing statute, how can an executive agency\ncontrol a judge\u2019s interpretation of an existing and equally binding\nregulation?Auerallows an agency to do exactly what this\nCourt has always said a legislature cannot do: \u201ccompel the courts\nto construe and apply\u201d a law on the books, \u201cnot according to the\njudicial .\u00a0.\u00a0. judgment,\u201d but according to the judgment\nof another branch.[90] When\nwe defer to an agency interpretation that differs from what we\nbelieve to be the best interpretation of the law, we compromise our\njudicial independence and deny the people who come before us the\nimpartial judgment that the Constitution guarantees them. And we\nmislead those whom we serve by placing a judicialimprimaturon what is, in fact, no more than an exercise of raw political\nexecutive power.[91]BWhat do our colleagues have to say about these\nconcerns? A majority has nothing to offer, and Justice Kagan\ndismisses them out of hand. In fact, she barely mentions the\nConstitution, other than to assure us thatAuerdoes not\nallow agencies to \u201cusur[p] the interpretive role of courts\u201d because\n\u201ccourts retain a firm grip on the interpretive function\u201d through\ntheir ability to decide whetherAuerdeference applies.Ante, at 25. But that is no assurance at all. The judicial\npower has always been understood to provide the people with a\nneutral arbiter who bears the responsibility and duty to \u201cexpound\nand interpret\u201d the governing law, not just the power to say whethersomeone else\u2019sinterpretation, let alone the interpretation\nof a self-interested political actor, is \u201creasonable.\u201d[92]To be sure, it\u2019s conceivable that Congress might\nseek to limit the ability of judges to remedy an adverse agency\naction. It might, for example, provide that a court shall have\npower to set aside agency action pursuant to a regulation only if\nthe action was based on an unreasonable interpretation of the\nregulation. But even assuming the constitutionality of a\nhypothetical statute like that,Aueris different. It does\nnotlimitthe scope of the judicial power; instead, it seeks\ntocooptthe judicial power by requiring an Article III\njudge to decide a case before him according to principles that he\nbelieves do not accurately reflect the law. UnderAuer, a\njudge is required to lay aside his independent judgment and declare\naffirmatively that a regulationmeanswhat the agencysaysit means\u2014and, thus, that the lawiswhat the\nagencysaysit is. Then the judge is compelled to exercise\nhis judicial authority to adjust private rights and obligations\nbased on the agency\u2019s (mis)understanding of the law. IfAuerwere a statute, it would not be an exercise of Congress\u2019s \u201cpower\n(within limits) to tell the courts whatclassesof cases\nthey may decide,\u201d or what relief they may supply, but a forbidden\nattempt \u201cto prescribe or superintendhowthey decide those\ncases.\u201d[93] And in the\nabsence of any statute like that, this Court surely should not so\nfreely give away to the executive branch its assigned\nresponsibility to interpret the laws. \u201cAbdication of responsibility\nis not part of the constitutional design.\u201d[94]In the end, Justice Kagan\u2019s only real reply is\nthis: However misguided it may be to hand over our interpretive\npowers to executive agencies, at least there isn\u2019t a mountain of\nempirical evidence showing that agencies have used this power to\ndeliberately write \u201cvague and open-ended\u201d regulations to maximize\ntheir interpretive leeway.Ante, at 24. But even this misses\nthe point. Whether or not regulations are \u201c\u00a0\u2018designed\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nto be vague,ibid., many can be read in different ways,\nespecially when new and unanticipated applications arise; cases\nlike that come before the courts all the time. WithoutAuer\u2019s shadow hanging over them, parties would receive a\nfair hearing before an impartial judge. The agency\u2019s interpretation\nwould sometimes be rejected; and that, in turn, might lead it to\nsolicit public comment on possible amendments to the regulation,\nwhich would provide an opportunity for public input that might\nproduce better policy. But withAuer, there is no fair\nhearing and no need for the agency to amend the regulation through\nnotice and comment. Whether purposeful or not, the agency\u2019s failure\nto write a clear regulation winds up increasing its power, allowing\nit to both write and interpret rules that bear the force of law\u2014in\nthe process uniting powers the Constitution deliberately separated\nand denying the people their right to an independent judicial\ndetermination of the law\u2019s meaning.IV. Policy ArgumentsLacking support elsewhere, Justice Kagan is\nforced to resort to policy arguments to defendAuer. But\neven the most sensible policy argument would not empower us to\nignore the plain language of the APA or the demands of the\nConstitution. And as we\u2019ve seen, those documents reflect a very\ndifferent \u201cpolicy\u201d judgment by the people and their\nrepresentatives. Besides, the policy argu- ments offered today are\nnot just unpersuasive, they are troubling.Take the first and boldest offering. Justice\nKagan suggests that determining the meaning of a regulation is\nlargely a matter of figuring out what the \u201cperson who wrote it\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. intended.\u201dAnte, at 8. In this way, we\u2019re\ntold, a legally binding regulation isn\u2019t all that different from \u201ca\nmemo or an e-mail\u201d\u2014if you \u201c[w]ant to know what [it] means,\u201d you\u2019d\nbetter \u201c[a]sk its author.\u201dAnte, at 8\u20139. But the federal\ngovernment\u2019s substantive rules are not like memos or e-mails; they\nare binding edicts that carry the force of law for all citizens.\nAnd if the rule of law means anything, it means that we are\ngoverned by the public meaning of the words found in statutes and\nregulations, not by their authors\u2019 private intentions. This is a\nvital part of what it means to have \u201ca government of laws, and not\nof men.\u201d[95] When judges\ninterpret a regulation, what we are trying to get at, as Justice\nHolmes explained long ago, is not the \u201cparticular intent\u201d of those\nwho wrote it, but \u201cwhat [its] words would mean [to] a normal\nspeaker of English .\u00a0.\u00a0. in the circumstances in which\nthey were used.\u201d[96] If the\nbest reading of the regulation turns out to be something other than\nwhat the agency claims to have intended, the agency is free to\nrewrite the regulation; but its secret intentions are not the\nlaw.Nor does Justice Kagan\u2019s account of the\ninterpretive process even wind up supportingAuer. If a\ncourt\u2019s goal in interpreting a regulation really were to determine\nwhat its author \u201cintended,\u201dAuerwould be an almost complete\nmismatch with the goal. Agency personnel change over time, and an\nagency\u2019s policy priorities may shift dramatically from one\npresidential administration to another. YetAuertells\ncourts that they must defer to the agency\u2019scurrentview of\nwhat the regulation ought to mean, which may or may not correspond\nto the views of those who actually wrote it. If interpreting a\nregulation really were just like reading an e-mail,Auerwould be like seeking guidance about the e-mail\u2019s meaning, years or\ndecades later, from the latest user of the computer from which the\ne-mail was sent. We\u2019ve repeatedly rejected that approach in the\ncontext of statutory interpretation. While Members of this Court\nsometimes disagree about the usefulness ofpre-enactmentlegislative history, we all agree that legislators\u2019 statements\nabout the meaning of an already-enacted statute are not \u201ca\nlegitimate tool of statutory interpretation,\u2019\u00a0\u201d much less a\ncontrolling one.[97] So why\non earth would we give \u201ccontrolling weight\u201d to an agency\u2019s\nstatements about the meaning of an already-promulgated\nregulation?Proceeding farther down this doubtful path,\nJustice Kagan asserts that resolving ambiguities in a regulation\n\u201csounds more in policy than in law\u201d and is thus a task more suited\nto executive officials than judges.Ante, at 9. But this\nclaim, too, contradicts a basic premise of our legal order: that we\nare governed not by the shifting whims of politicians and\nbureaucrats, but by written laws whose meaning is fixed and\nascertainable\u2014if not by all members of the public, then at least by\nlawyers who can advise them and judges who must apply the law to\nindividual cases guided by the neutral principles found in our\ntraditional tools of interpretation. The text of the regulation is\ntreatedasthe law, and the agency\u2019s policy judgment has the\nforce of lawonlyinsofar as it is embodied in the\nregulatory text. If \u201cnew issues demanding new policy calls\u201d arise\nthat aren\u2019t addressed in existing regulations,ante, at 10,\nthe solution is for the agency to promulgate new regulations using\nthe notice-and-comment procedures set forth in the APA. But an\nagency has no warrant to compel judges to change the law to conform\nwith the agency\u2019s current policy preferences.To be sure, during the period ofAuer\u2019s\nascendancy some suggested that the meaning of written law is always\n\u201cradically indeterminate\u201d and that judges expounding it are \u201cfor\nthe most part, guided by policy\u2014not text.\u201d[98] And in an environment like that it was\nperhaps thought a small step to conclude that, if legal disputes\nare going to be resolved on political grounds, then they ought to\nbe resolved by real politicians in the executive branch rather than\nersatz politicians on the bench. But the proposed cure proved worse\nthan the disease. Arguments like these surrendered the judgment\nembodied in our Constitution and the APA that courts owe the people\nthey serve their independent legal judgment about the law\u2019s\nmeaning. Besides, we\u2019ve long since come to realize that the real\ncure doesn\u2019t lie in turning judges into rubber stamps for\npoliticians, but in redirecting the judge\u2019s interpretive task back\nto its roots, away from open-ended policy appeals and speculation\nabout legislative intentions and toward the traditional tools of\ninterpretation judges have employed for centuries to elucidate the\nlaw\u2019s original public meaning. Today it is even said that we judges\nare, to one degree or another, \u201call textualists now.\u201d[99]Pursuing a more modest tack, Justice Kagan next\nsuggests thatAueris justified by the respect due agencies\u2019\n\u201ctechnical\u201d expertise.Ante, at 10. But no one doubts that\ncourts should pay close attention to an expert agency\u2019s views on\ntechnical questions in its field. Just as a court \u201cwould want to\nknow what John Henry Wigmore said about an issue of evidence law\n[or] what Arthur Corbin thought about a matter of contract law,\u201d so\ntoo should courts carefully consider what the Food and Drug\nAdministration thinks about how its prescription drug safety\nregulations operate.[100]\nThe fact remains, however, that even agency experts \u201ccan be wrong;\neven Homer nodded.\u201d[101]Skidmoreand the traditional approach it embodied recognized\nboth of these facts of life long ago, explaining that, while courts\nshould of course afford respectful consideration to the expert\nagency\u2019s views, they must remain open to competing expert and other\nevidence supplied in an adversarial setting. Respect for an\nagency\u2019s technical expertise demands no more.Justice Kagan\u2019s final policy argument is thatAuerpromotes \u201cconsistency\u201d and \u201cuniformity\u201d in the\ninterpretation of regulations.Ante, at 10\u201311. If we let\ncourts decide what regulations mean, she warns, they might\ndisagree, and it might take some time for higher courts to resolve\nthose disagreements. But consistency and uniformity are hardly\ngrounds on whichAuer\u2019s advocates should wish to fight. The\njudicial process is how we settle disputes about the meaning of\nwritten law, and our judicial system is more than capable of\nproducing a single, uniform, and stable interpretation that will\nlast until the regulation is amended or repealed. Meanwhile, underAuercourts often disagree about whether deference is\nwarranted, seesupra, at 10\u201311, and a regulation\u2019s \u201cmeaning\u201d\ncan be transformed with the stroke of a pen any time there is a new\npresidential administration. \u201cConsistency,\u201d \u201cuniformity,\u201d and\nstability in the law are hardly amongAuer\u2019s crowning\nachievements.V.Stare DecisisIn the end, a majority declines to endorse\nJustice Kagan\u2019s arguments and insists only that, even ifAueris not \u201cright and well-reasoned,\u201d we\u2019re stuck with it\nbecause of the respect due precedent.Ante, at 27.But notice: While pretending to bow tostare\ndecisis, the majority goes about reshaping our precedent in new\nand experimental ways. True, the majority admits, this Court has in\nthe past accordedAuerdeference\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018reflexive[ly],\u2019\u00a0\u201d \u201cwithout significant analysis of the\nunderlying regulation\u201d or \u201ccareful attention to [its] nature and\ncontext,\u201d and encouraged lower courts to do the same.Ante,\nat 12\u201313. But no more. From now on, the majority says, not only\nmust judges \u201cexhaust all the \u2018traditional tools\u2019 of construction\u201d\nto decide whether the agency\u2019s interpretation is \u201creasonable,\u201d they\nmust also make \u201can independent inquiry into whether the character\nand context of the agency interpretation\u201d justifies deference.Ante, at 13\u201315. The majority candidly admits that it finds\nit impossible to \u201creduce\u201d this new inquiry \u201cto any exhaustive\ntest,\u201d so it settles for laying out some \u201cmarkers.\u201dAnte, at\n15. What are the markers? We are told that courts should often\u2014but\nnot always\u2014withhold deference from an interpretation offered by\nmid-level agency staff; often\u2014but not always\u2014withhold deference\nfrom a nontechnical, \u201cprosaic-seeming\u201d interpretation; often\u2014but\nnot always\u2014withhold deference from an interpretation advanced for\nthe first time in anamicusbrief; and often\u2014but not\nalways\u2014withhold deference from an interpretation that conflicts\nwith an earlier one. Seeante, at 15\u201318. The only certainty\nin all this is that the majority isn\u2019t really much moved bystare decisis; everyone recognizes, to one degree or\nanother, thatAuercannot stand. And between our remaining\nchoices\u2014continuing to make up new deference rules, or returning to\nthe text of the APA and the approach to judicial review that\nprevailed for most of our history\u2014the answer should have been\neasy.AThere are serious questions about whetherstare decisisshould apply here at all. To be sure,Auer\u2019s narrow holding about the meaning of the regulation at\nissue in that case may be entitled tostare decisiseffect.\nThe same may be true for the specific holdings in other cases where\nthis Court has appliedAuerdeference. But doesstare\ndecisisextend beyond those discrete holdings and bind future\nMembers of this Court to applyAuer\u2019s broader deference\nframework?It seems doubtful thatstare decisisdemands that much. We are not dealing with a precedent that\npurported to settle the meaning of a single statute or regulation\nor resolve a particular case. TheAuerdoctrine claims to do\nmuch more than that\u2014to prescribe an interpretive methodology\ngoverning every future dispute over the meaning of every\nregulation. In other contexts, we do not regard statements in our\nopinions about such generally applicable interpretive methods, like\nthe proper weight to afford historical practice in constitutional\ncases or legislative history in statutory cases, as binding future\nJustices with the full force of horizontalstare\ndecisis.[102] Why,\nthen, should we regard as bindingAuer\u2019s statements about\nthe weight to afford agencies\u2019 interpretations in regulatory cases?\nTo the extentAuerpurports to dictate \u201cthe interpretive\ninferences that future Justices must draw in construing statutes\nand regulations that the Court has never engaged,\u201d it may well\n\u201cexceed the limits of stare decisis.\u201d[103]Even if our past expressions of support forAuerdeference bearsomeprecedential force, they\ncertainly are not entitled (as the majority suggests,ante,\nat 26\u201327) to the special, heightened form ofstare decisiswe reserve for narrow statutory decisions. In contrast to\nprecedents that fix the meaning ofparticularstatutes and\ngenerate reliance interests in the process, theAuerdoctrine is an abstract default rule of interpretive methodology\nthat settles nothing of its own force. And this Court has\nrecognized that it is \u201cinconsistent with the Court\u2019s proper role\u201d\nto insist that Congress exercise its legislative power to overturn\nsuch erroneous and judicially invented \u201cdefault rule[s].\u201d[104] That should be especially so\nhere becauseAuer\u2019s default rule undermines judicial\nindependence, which this Court has a special responsibility to\ndefend.Nor is it entirely clear that Congresscouldoverturn theAuerdoctrine legislatively. The\nmajority describesAueras a \u201cpresumption\u201d about how courts\nshould interpret statutes granting rulemaking power to agencies.Ante, at 12. Congress can, of course,rebutthe\npresumption on a statute-by-statute basis, or even for all past\nstatutes. But can CongresseliminatetheAuerpresumption for future statutes? Perhaps\u2014but legislation like that\nwould raise questions, which the majority does not address, about\nthe ability of one Congress to entrench its preferences by\nattempting to control the interpretation of legislation enacted by\nfuture Congresses.[105]\nWe should not be in the business of tossing \u201c\u00a0\u2018balls\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. into Congress\u2019s court,\u2019\u00a0\u201dante, at 27,\nthat would explode with constitutional questions if Congress tried\nto pick them up.BEven assuming for argument\u2019s sake that\nstandardstare decisisconsiderations apply, they still do\nnot require us to retainAuer. Even the majority implicitly\nrecognizes this much, as it proceeds to vacate a lower court\njudgment that faithfully appliedAuerand instruct that\ncourt to try again using the majority\u2019s new directions. Ifstare\ndecisisallows us so freely to remodelAuer, it\u2019s hard\nto see on what account it might require us to retain it.We do not lightly overturn precedents, and we\nseek always to honor the thoughtful guidance of those who have\npreceded us. At the same time, everyone agrees thatstare\ndecisisis not an \u201c\u00a0\u2018inexorable command,\u2019\u00a0\u201d[106] and this Court should not\nalways remain bound to decisions whose \u201crationale no longer\nwithstands \u2018careful analysis.\u2019\u00a0\u201d[107] Recognizing the need for balance in this area,\nthe Court has, over time, fashioned principles to guide our\ntreatment of precedent. Those principles call on us to consider\nfactors such as \u201cthe quality of [the precedent\u2019s] reasoning, the\nworkability of the rule it established, its consistency with other\nrelated decisions, developments since the decision was handed down,\nand reliance on the decision.\u201d[108] As applied toAuer, all of these\nconsiderations weigh strongly in favor of bidding farewell to the\ndoctrine rather than keeping it on life support.First, we\u2019ve already seen that no\npersuasive rationale supportsAuer. From its humble origins\nas an unexplained bit of dictum in a wartime case about emergency\nprice controls, theAuerdoctrine evolved into a rigid rule\nof deference\u2014all without any serious attempt by this Court to\nrationalize it or reconcile it with the APA, the Constitution, or\ntraditional modes of judicial review. See Part I,supra.\nEven its fiercest defenders acknowledge that \u201cAuerdeference\nhas not remained static over time\u201d and urge the Court to continue\nto \u201cshape\u201d and \u201crefin[e]\u201d the doctrine.[109] Today\u2019s decision attempts just such a\n\u201crefinement\u201d by hedgingAuerwith new qualifications and\nlimitations. Seeante, at 11\u201318. This shifting ground\n\u201cundermin[es] the force ofstare decisis.\u201d[110]Second, today\u2019s ruling all but admits\nthatAuerhas not proved to be a workable standard. Even\nbefore this latest overhaul, uncertainty surroundingAuer\u2019s\nscope and application had caused many to question whether there was\nany \u201cpractical benefit\u201d in continuing to applyAuer\u201crather\nthan a less deferential but more flexible and open-ended standard\nlikeSkidmore.\u201d[111] Seesupra, at 10\u201311. Nor does the majority\u2019s\nkinder, gentler version ofAuerpromise to solve the\nproblem. On the contrary, its newly mandated inquiry into the\n\u201ccharacter and context of the agency interpretation,\u201d which it\nadmits cannot be reduced \u201cto any exhaustive test,\u201dante, at\n15, seems destined only to compound the confusion. Seesupra, at 35. Many words come to mind to describe the tasks\nwe assign lower court judges today, but \u201cworkable\u201d is not among\nthem.Third, theAuerdoctrine is, as we\nhave also already seen, out of step with how courts normally\ninterpret written laws. When we interpret a regulation, we\ntypically (at least when there is no agency say-so) proceed in the\nsame way we would when interpreting any other written law: We\n\u201cbegin our interpretation of the regulation with its text\u201d and, if\nthe text is unclear, we \u201cturn to other canons of interpretation\u201d\nand tie-breaking rules to resolve the ambiguity.[112] And when we interpret an ambiguousstatute, we never ask what current members of Congress think\nit means; in fact, we\u2019ve held unanimously that legislators\u2019\npost-enactment views about a statute\u2019s meaning are not even a\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018legitimate tool of statutory\ninterpretation.\u2019\u00a0\u201d[113] Affording \u201ccontrolling weight\u201d to regulators\u2019\npost-promulgation views about the meaning of an ambiguous\nregulation is hard to square with these usual judicial\npractices.[114]Fourth, the explosive growth of the\nadministrative state over the last half-century has exacerbatedAuer\u2019s potential for mischief. When the Court first uttered\nits dictum inSeminole Rock, the administrative state was\nnew and the APA was only a gleam in Congress\u2019s eye. Even 20 years\nlater, when the Court began reviving theSeminole Rockdictum and turning it into a new deference doctrine, it was not yet\napparent how pervasive the administrative state would become in the\nlives of ordinary Americans. Now, in the 21st century, \u201c[t]he\nadministrative state wields vast power and touches almost every\naspect of daily life.\u201d[115] Among other things, it produces \u201c\u00a0\u2018reams of\nregulations\u2019\u00a0\u201d[116]\u2014so many that they dwarf the statutes enacted by\nCongress. As of 2018, the Code of Federal Regulations filled 242\nvolumes and was about 185,000 pages long, almost quadruple the\nlength of the most recent edition of the U.\u00a0S. Code.[117] And agencies add thousands\nmore pages of regulations every year. Whether you think this\nadministrative fecundity is a good or a bad thing, it surely means\nthat the cost of continuing to deny citizens an impartial judicial\nhearing on the meaning of disputed regulations has increased\ndramatically since this Court started down this road.Fifth,Auerhas generated no\nserious reliance interests. The only parties that might have relied\nonAuer\u2019s promise of deference are agencies that usepost\u00a0hocinterpretations to bypass the APA\u2019s\nnotice-and-comment procedures. But this Court has never suggested\nthat the convenience of government officials should count in the\nbalance ofstare decisis, especially when weighed against\nthe interests of citizens in a fair hearing before an independent\njudge and a stable and knowable set of laws. In short,\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018[t]he fact that [agencies] may view [Auerdeference]\nas an entitlement does not establish the sort of reliance interest\nthat could outweigh the countervailing interest\u2019\u00a0\u201d of all\ncitizens \u201c\u00a0\u2018in having their constitutional rights fully\nprotected.\u2019\u00a0\u201d[118]Coming closer to the mark, the majority worries\nthat \u201cabandoningAuerdeference would cast doubt on many\nsettled constructions\u201d of regulations on which regulated parties\nmight have relied.Ante, at 26. But, again, decisions\nconstruing particular regulations might retainstare decisiseffect even if the Court announced that it would no longer adhere\ntoAuer\u2019s interpretive methodology. After all, decisions\nconstruing particular statutes continue to command respect even\nwhen the interpretive methods that led to those constructions fall\nout of favor. Besides, if the majority is correct that abandoningAuerwould require revisiting regulatory constructions that\nwere upheld based onAuerdeference, the majority\u2019s revision\nofAuerwill yield exactly the same result. There are\ninnumerable lower court decisions that have followed this Court\u2019s\nlead and affordedAuerdeference mechanically, without\nconducting the inquiry the Court now holds is required. Today\u2019s\nruling casts no less doubt on the continuing validity of those\ndecisions than we would if we simply moved on fromAuer.*OverrulingAuerwould have taken us\ndirectly back toSkidmore, liberating courts to decide cases\nbased on their independent judgment and \u201cfollow [the] agency\u2019s\n[view] only to the extent it is persuasive.\u201d[119] By contrast, the majority\u2019s attempt to\nremodelAuer\u2019s rule into a multi-step, multi-factor inquiry\nguarantees more uncertainty and much litigation. Proceeding in this\nconvoluted way burdens our colleagues on the lower courts, who will\nhave to spend time debating deference that they could have spent\ninterpreting disputed regulations. It also continues to deny the\npeople who come before us the neutral forum for their disputes that\nthey rightly expect and deserve.But this cloud may have a silver lining: The\nmajority leavesAuerso riddled with holes that, when all is\nsaid and done, courts may find that it does not constrain their\nindependent judgment any more thanSkidmore. As\nreengineered,Auerrequires courts to \u201cexhaust all the\n\u2018traditional tools\u2019 of construction\u201d before they even consider\ndeferring to an agency.Ante, at 13\u201314. And those tools\ninclude all sorts of tie-breaking rules for resolving ambiguity\neven in the closest cases. Courts manage to make do with these\ntools in many other areas of the law, so one might hope they will\nhardly ever find them inadequate here. And if they do, they will\nnow have to conduct a further inquiry that includes so few firm\nguides and so many cryptic \u201cmarkers\u201d that they will rarely, if\never, have to defer to an agency regulatory interpretation that\ndiffers from what they believe is the best and fairest reading.But whatever happens, this case hardly promises\nto be this Court\u2019s last word onAuer. If today\u2019s opinion\nends up reducingAuerto the role of a tin god\u2014officious,\nbut ultimately powerless\u2014then a future Court should candidly admit\nas much and stop requiring litigants and lower courts to pay token\nhomage to it. Alternatively, ifAuerproves more resilient,\nthis Court should reassert its responsibility to say what the law\nis and afford the people the neutral forum for their disputes that\nthey expect and deserve.Notes1519\nU.S. 452(1997).2Larkin & Slattery,\nThe World AfterSeminole RockandAuer, 42 Harv.\nJ.\u00a0L. & Pub.
