Although I agree that rigid\napplication of theLemontest does not solve every\nEstablishment Clause problem, I think that test\u2019s focus on purposes\nand effects is crucial in evaluating government action in this\nsphere\u2014as this very suit shows. I therefore do not join Part II\u2013A.\nI do not join Part II\u2013D out of perhaps an excess of caution.\nAlthough I too \u201clook[\u00a0] to history for guidance,\u201dante,at 25 (plurality opinion), I prefer at least for now to do so\ncase-by-case, rather than to sign on to any broader statements\nabout history\u2019s role in Establishment Clause analysis. But I find\nmuch to admire in this section of the opinion\u2014particularly, its\nemphasis on whether longstanding monuments, symbols, and practices\nreflect \u201crespect and tolerance for differing views, an honest\nendeavor to achieve inclusivity and nondiscrimination, and a\nrecognition of the important role that religion plays in the lives\nof many Americans.\u201dAnte,at 28. Here, as elsewhere, the\nopinion shows sensitivity to and respect for this Nation\u2019s\npluralism, and the values of neutrality and inclusion that the\nFirst Amendment demands.",
