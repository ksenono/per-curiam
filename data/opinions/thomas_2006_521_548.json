BEARD, SECRETARY, PENNSYLVANIA\nDEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS, PETITIONERv.RONALD BANKS,\nindividually and on behalf of all others similarly situatedon writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the third circuit[June 28, 2006]Justice Thomas, with whom Justice\nScalia joins, concurring in the judgment.Judicial scrutiny of prison\nregulations is an endeavor fraught with peril. Just last Term, this\nCourt invalidated California\u2019s policy of racially segregating\nprisoners in its reception centers, notwithstanding that State\u2019s\nwarning that its policy was necessary to prevent prison violence.\nSeeJohnsonv.California,543 U. S. 499(2005).\nCalifornia subsequently experienced several instances of severe\nrace-based prison violence, including a riot that resulted in 2\nfatalities and more than 100 injuries, and significant fighting\nalong racial lines between newly arrived inmates, the very inmates\nthat were subject to the policy invalidated by the Court inJohnson. See Winton & Bernstein, More Violence Erupts\nat Pitchess; Black and Latino inmates clash at the north county\njail, leaving 13 injured, Los Angeles Times, Mar. 1, 2006, Metro\nDesk, p. B1. This powerful reminder of the grave dangers inherent\nin prison administration confirms my view that the framework I set\nforth inOvertonv.Bazzetta,539 U. S. 126, 138\n(2003) (opinion concurring in judgment), is the least perilous\napproach for resolving challenges to prison regulations, as well as\nthe approach that is most faithful to the Constitution.\nAccordingly, I concur only in the judgment of the Court.IBoth the plurality and the\ndissent evaluate the regulations challenged in this case pursuant\nto the approach set forth inTurnerv.Safley,482 U. S. 78(1987), which permits prison regulations that \u201cimping[e] on\ninmates\u2019 constitutional rights\u201d if the regulations are \u201creasonably\nrelated to legitimate penological interests.\u201dId., at 89.\nBut as I explained inOverton,Turnerand its\nprogeny \u201crest on the unstated (and erroneous) presumption that the\nConstitution contains an implicit definition of incarceration.\u201dOverton, 539 U. S., at 139 (opinion concurring in\njudgment). Because the Constitution contains no such definition,\n\u201cStates are free to define and redefine all types of punishment,\nincluding imprisonment, to encompass various types of\ndeprivations\u2014provided only that those deprivations are\nconsistent with the Eighth Amendment.\u201dIbid.(emphasis in original). Respondent has not challenged\nPennsylvania\u2019s prison policy as a violation of the Eighth\nAmendment, and thus the sole inquiry in this case is whether\nrespondent\u2019s sentence deprived him of the rights he now seeks to\nexercise.Id., at 140.\u201cWhether a sentence encompasses\nthe extinction of a constitutional right enjoyed by free persons\nturns on state law, for it is a State\u2019s prerogative to determine\nhow it will punish violations of its law.\u201dIbid.[Footnote 1] Although the question of\nwhether Pennsylvania intended to confer upon respondent and other\ninmates a right to have unfettered access to newspapers, magazines,\nand photographs is thus \u201cultimately for the State itself to\nanswer,\u201d in the absence of a resolution of that question by the\nPennsylvania Supreme Court, we must resolve it in the instant case.Id., at 141. Fortunately, the answer is\nstraightforward.InOverton, I explained:\u201c[s]entencing a criminal to a term of imprisonment\nmay, under state law, carry with it the implied delegation to\nprison officials to discipline and otherwise supervise the criminal\nwhile he is incarcerated. Thus, restrictions imposed by prison\nofficials may also be a part of the sentence, provided that those\nofficials are not acting ultra vires with respect to the discretion\ngiven them, by implication, in the sentence.\u201dId., at 140,\nn. *A term of imprisonment in Pennsylvania includes\nsuch an implied delegation. Pennsylvania inmates are subject to the\nrules and disciplinary measures set forth by the Pennsylvania\nDepartment of Corrections. See,e.g.,Bulletin Inmate\nDiscipline, Policy No. DC\u2013ADM 801 (2004),\nhttp://www.cor.state.pa.us/standards/lib/standards/\nDC-ADM_801_Inmate_Discipline.pdf (as visited June 12, 2006, and\navailable in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file). And no one disputes that\nthe regulations challenged in the instant litigation fall within\nthe discretion given to the Department of Corrections. As inOverton, the conclusion that these regulations are\nincluded in the prison sentence is strongly supported by the\nplurality\u2019sTurneranalysis. A prison policy that has a\n\u201cvalid rational connection [to] the \u2026 legitimate penological\nobjectives\u201d of improving prison security and discouraging inmate\nmisbehavior,ante,at 8 (internal quotation marks\nomitted), \u201cthat [is] designed to avoid adverse impacts on guards,\ninmates, or prison resources, [and] that cannot be replaced by\n\u2018ready alternatives,\u2019 [is] presumptively included within a sentence\nof imprisonment.\u201dOverton, 539 U. S., at 141\u2013142\n(Thomas,\u00a0J., concurring in judgment).The \u201chistory of incarceration as punishment\n[also] supports the view that the sentenc[e] imposed on\nresponden[t] terminated\u201d his unfettered right to magazines,\nnewspapers, and photographs.Id., at 142. As I explained\ninOverton, imprisonment as punishment \u201cbecame\nstandardized in the period between 1780 and 1865,\u201did., at\n143 (citing McGowen, The Well-Ordered Prison: England, 1780\u20131865,\nin The Oxford History of the Prison: The Practice of Punishment in\nWestern Society 79 (N. Morris & D. Rothman eds. 1995)), and was\ndistinguished by the prisoner\u2019s isolation from the outside world.\n539 U. S., at 143. Indeed, both the Pennsylvania and Auburn prison\nmodels, which formed the basis for prison systems throughout the\nNation in the early 1800\u2019s, imposed this isolation specifically by\ndenying prisoners access to reading materials and contact with\ntheir families. Rothman, Perfecting the Prison: United States,\n1789\u20131865, in The Oxford History of the Prison 117; see alsoid.,at 118 (explaining that in the Pennsylvania system,\ninmates were \u201cgiven nothing to read except the Bible and were\nprevented from corresponding with friends and family\u201d); S.\nChristianson, With Liberty for Some: 500 Years of Imprisonment in\nAmerica 145 (1998) (explaining that in Sing Sing, the standard\nbearer for the Auburn model, no reading materials of any kind,\nexcept the Bible, were allowed inside). Even as the advent of\nprison libraries increased prisoners\u2019 access to reading materials,\nthat access was universally \u201csubject to some form of censorship,\u201d\nsuch that \u201cinmates of correctional institutions are denied access\nto books which are freely available to the rest of the community.\u201d\nG. Bramley, Outreach: Library Services for the Institutionalized,\nthe Elderly, and the Physically Handicapped 91, 93 (1978).Although Pennsylvania \u201cis free to alter its\ndefinition of incarceration to include the retention\u201d of unfettered\naccess to magazines, newspapers, and photographs, it appears that\nthe Commonwealth instead sentenced respondent against the backdrop\nof its traditional conception of imprisonment, which affords no\nsuch privileges.Overton,supra, at 144\u2013145\n(Thomas, J., concurring in judgment). Accordingly, respondent\u2019s\nchallenge to Pennsylvania\u2019s prison regulations must fail.IIThis case reveals the\nshortcomings of theTurnerframework, at least insofar as\nthat framework is applied to prison regulations that seek to modify\ninmate behavior through privilege deprivation. In applying the\nfirstTurnerfactor, the plurality correctly observes that\nPennsylvania\u2019s policy of depriving its most incorrigible inmates of\ntheir last few remaining privileges bears a \u201cvalid rational\nconnection\u201d to the \u201clegitimate penological objectiv[e]\u201d of\n\u201cencourag[ing] progress and discourag[ing] backsliding\u201d of inmate\ncompliance with prison rules.Ante,at 8, 9 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). Indeed, this Court has previously\ndetermined that \u201c[w]ithdrawing \u2026 privileges is a proper and even\nnecessary management technique to induce compliance with the rules\nof inmate behavior, especially for high-security prisoners.\u201dOverton, supra, at 134.[Footnote 2]Although\npolicies, such as Pennsylvania\u2019s, that seek to promote compliance\nwith prison rules by withdrawing various privileges may always\nsatisfyTurner\u2019s first factor, they necessarily fail its\nsecond factor. Such policies, by design, do not provide an\n\u201calternative means\u201d for inmates to exercise the rights they have\nbeen deprived. 482 U. S., at 90. The \u201clegitimate penological\nobjectiv[e]\u201d of encouraging compliance with prison rules by\ndepriving misbehaving inmates of various privileges simply cannot\nbe accomplished if prison officials are required to provide\nprisoners with an alternative and equivalent set of privileges.\nThus, the plurality\u2019s observation that respondent\u2019s privileges may\nbe restored in response to continued, improved behavior, is simply\nirrelevant to the second factor ofTurner, which asks only\n\u201cwhether \u2026 alternative means of exercising the right \u2026 remain open\nto prison inmates.\u201dIbid.The answer in the context of\nprivilege deprivation policies is always no, thus demonstrating the\ndifficulty of analyzing such policies under theTurnerframework.The third and fourthTurnerfactors are likewise poorly suited to determining\nthe validity of inmate privilege deprivation policies. When the\n\u201cvalid penological objectiv[e]\u201d of a prison policy is encouraging\ncompliance with prison rules, it makes little sense to inquire into\n\u201cthe impact accommodation of the asserted constitutional right will\nhave on guards and other inmates, and on the allocation of prison\nresources generally,\u201d or into the availability of \u201cready\nalternatives.\u201dIbid. At best, such inquiries merely\ncollapse the third and fourth factors into the first, because\naccommodating the exercise of the deprived right will undermine the\nincentive effects of the prison policy and because the\nunavailability of \u201cready alternatives\u201d is typically (as in this\ncase) one of the underlying rationales for the adoption of inmate\nprivilege deprivation policies.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*Because the\nprison regulations at issue today are permissible under the\napproach I explained inOverton, I concur in the judgment\nof the Court.Footnote\n1As inOverton,\nrespondent has not asked this Court to abstain from resolving his\nconstitutional challenge underRailroad Comm\u2019n of Tex.v.Pullman Co.,312 U. S. 496(1941)\n(holding that federal courts should ordinarily abstain where the\nresolution of a federal constitutional issue may be rendered\nirrelevant by the determination of a predicate state-law question),\nand the issue ofPullmanabstention was not considered\nbelow. As a result, respondent has \u201csubmitted to the sort of\nguesswork about the meaning of prison sentences that is the\nhallmark of theTurnerinquiry.\u201dOverton, 539 U.\nS., at 141 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment).Footnote\n2In my view, this legal\nconclusion, combined with the deference to the judgment of prison\nofficials required underTurner, seeante,at\n8\u201315, would entitle prison officials to summary judgment against\nchallenges to their inmate prison deprivation policies in virtually\nevery case. In this context, it is highly unlikely a prisoner could\nestablish that the \u201cconnection between the regulation and the\nasserted goal is arbitrary or irrational.\u201dShawv.Murphy,532\nU. S. 223, 229 (2001) (internal quotation marks\nomitted).",
