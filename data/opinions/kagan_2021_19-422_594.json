YELLEN, SECRETARY OF THE\nTREASURY, et\u00a0al.JANET L. YELLEN, SECRETARY OF THE\nTREASURY, et\u00a0al., PETITIONERS19\u2013563v.PATRICK J. COLLINS, et\u00a0al.on writs of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the fifth circuit[June 23, 2021]Justice Kagan, with whom Justice Breyer and\nJustice Sotomayor join as to Part II, concurring in part and\nconcurring in the judgment in part.Faced with a global financial crisis, Congress\ncreated the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) and gave it broad\npowers to rescue the Nation\u2019s mortgage market. I join the Court in\ndeciding that the FHFA wielded its authority within statutory\nlimits. On the main constitutional question, though, I concur only\nin the judgment.Stare decisiscompels the conclusion that\nthe FHFA\u2019s for-cause removal provision violates the Constitution.\nBut the majority\u2019s opinion rests on faulty theoretical premises and\ngoes further than it needs to. I also write to address the remedial\nquestion. The majority\u2019s analysis, which I join, well explains why\nbackwards-looking relief is not always necessary to redress a\nremoval violation. I add only two thoughts. The broader is that the\nmajority\u2019s remedial holding mitigates the harm of the removal\ndoctrine applied here. The narrower is that, as I read the decision\nbelow, the Court of Appeals has already done what is needed to find\nthat the plaintiffs are not entitled to their requested relief.II agree with the majority thatSeila Law\nLLCv.Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, 591\nU.\u00a0S. ___ (2020), governs the constitutional question here.\nSeeante, at 26. InSeila Law, the Court held that an\n\u201cagency led by a single [d]irector and vested with significant\nexecutive power\u201d comports with the Constitution only if the\nPresident can fire the director at will. 591 U.\u00a0S., at ___\n(slip op., at 18). I dissented from that decision\u2014vehemently. Seeid., at ___ (Kagan, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 4) (\u201cThe\ntext of the Constitution, the history of the country, the\nprecedents of this Court, and the need for sound and adaptable\ngovernance\u2014all stand against the majority\u2019s opinion\u201d). But the\n\u201cdoctrine ofstare decisisrequires us, absent special\ncircumstances, to treat like cases alike\u201d\u2014even when that means\nadhering to a wrong decision.June Medical Services\nL.\u00a0L.\u00a0C.v.Russo, 591 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___\n(2020) (Roberts, C.\u00a0J., concurring in judgment) (slip op., at\n2). So the issue now is not whetherSeila Lawwas correct.\nThe question is whether that case is distinguishable from this one.\nAnd it is not. As I observed inSeila Law, the FHFA \u201cplays a\ncrucial role in overseeing the mortgage market, on which millions\nof Americans annually rely.\u201d 591 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at\n31). It thus wields \u201csignificant executive power,\u201d much as the\nagency inSeila Lawdid. And I agree with the majority that\nthere is no other legally relevant distinction between the two. Seeante, at 29\u201332.For two reasons, however, I do not join the\nmajority\u2019s discussion of the constitutional issue. First is the\nmajority\u2019s political theory. Throughout the relevant part of its\nopinion, the majority offers a contestable\u2014and, in my view, deeply\nflawed\u2014account of how our government should work. At-will removal\nauthority, the majority intones, \u201cis essential to subject Executive\nBranch actions to a degree of electoral accountability\u201d\u2014and so\ncourts should grant the President that power in cases like this\none.Ante, at 27. I see the matter differently (as, I might\nadd, did the Framers).Seila Law, 591 U.\u00a0S., at ___\u2013___\n(Kagan, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 9\u201313). The right way to\nensure that government operates with \u201celectoral accountability\u201d is\nto lodge decisions about its structure with, well, \u201cthe branches\naccountable to the people.\u201dId., at ___ (slip op., at 38);\nseeid., at ___ (slip op., at 39) (the Constitution\n\u201cinstructs Congress, not this Court, to decide on agency design\u201d).\nI will subscribe to decisions contrary to my view where precedent,\nfairly read, controls (and there is no special justification for\nreversal). But I will not join the majority\u2019s mistaken musings\nabout how to create \u201ca workable government.\u201dId., at ___\n(slip op., at 38) (quotingYoungstown Sheet & Tube Co.v.Sawyer,343 U.S.\n579, 635 (1952) (Jackson, J., concurring)).My second objection is to the majority\u2019s\nextension ofSeila Law\u2019s holding. Again and again,Seila\nLawemphasized that its rule was limited to single-director\nagencies \u201cwield[ing] significant executive power.\u201d 591 U.\u00a0S.,\nat ___ (plurality opinion) (slip op., at 2); seeid., at ___\n(majority opinion) (slip op., at 18);id., at ___ (plurality\nopinion) (slip op., at 36). To takeSeila Lawat its word is\nto acknowledge where it left off: If an agency did not exercise\n\u201csignificant executive power,\u201d the constitutionality of a removal\nrestriction would remain an open question. Accord,post, at\n11\u201312 (Sotomayor, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).\nBut today\u2019s majority careens right past that boundary line. Without\neven mentioningSeila Law\u2019s \u201csignificant executive power\u201d\nframing, the majority announces that, actually, \u201cthe\nconstitutionality of removal restrictions\u201d does not \u201chinge[\u00a0]\u201d\non \u201cthe nature and breadth of an agency\u2019s authority.\u201dAnte,\nat 27, 29. Any \u201cagency led by a single Director,\u201d no matter how\nmuch executive power it wields, now becomes subject to the\nrequirement of at-will removal.Ante, at 26. And the\nmajority\u2019s broadening is gratuitous\u2014unnecessary to resolve the\ndispute here. As the opinion later explains, the FHFA exercises\nplenty of executive authority: Indeed, it might \u201cbe considered more\npowerful than the CFPB.\u201dAnte, at 28. So the majority could\neasily have stayed within, rather than reached out beyond, the ruleSeila Lawcreated.In thus departing fromSeila Law, the\nmajority strays from its own obligation to respect precedent. To\nensure that our decisions reflect the \u201cevenhanded\u201d and \u201cconsistent\ndevelopment of legal principles,\u201d not just shifts in the Court\u2019s\npersonnel, stare decisisdemands something of Justices\npreviously on the losing side.Paynev.Tennessee,501 U.S.\n808, 827 (1991). They (meaning here, I) must fairly apply\ndecisions with which they disagree. But fidelity to precedent also\nplaces demands on the winners. They must apply the Court\u2019s\nprecedents\u2014limits and all\u2014wherever they can, rather than widen them\nunnecessarily at the first opportunity. Because today\u2019s majority\ndoes not conform to that command, I concur in the judgment\nonly.III join in full the majority\u2019s discussion of\nthe proper remedy for the constitutional violation it finds. I too\nbelieve that our Appointments Clause precedents have little to say\nabout remedying a removal problem. Seeante, at 33\u201334; cf.Luciav.SEC, 585 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2018) (slip\nop., at 12) (requiring a new hearing before a properly appointed\nofficial). As the majority explains, the officers heading the FHFA,\nunlike those with invalid appointments, possessed the \u201cauthority to\ncarry out the functions of the office.\u201dAnte, at 34. I also\nagree that plaintiffs alleging a removal violation are entitled to\ninjunctive relief\u2014a rewinding of agency action\u2014only when the\nPresident\u2019s inability to fire an agency head affected the\ncomplained-of decision. Seeante, at 35\u201336. Only then is\nrelief needed to restore the plaintiffs to the position they \u201cwould\nhave occupied in the absence\u201d of the removal problem.Millikenv.Bradley,433 U.S.\n267, 280 (1977); see D. Laycock & R. Hasen, Modern American\nRemedies 275 (5th ed. 2019). Granting relief in any other case\nwould, contrary to usual remedial principles, put the plaintiffs\n\u201cin a better position\u201d than if no constitutional violation had\noccurred.Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Ed.v.Doyle,429 U.S.\n274, 285 (1977).The majority\u2019s remedial holding limits the\ndamage of the Court\u2019s removal jurisprudence. As the majority\nexplains, its holding ensures that actions the President\nsupports\u2014which would have gone forward whatever his removal\npower\u2014will remain in place. Seeante, at 35. In refusing to\nrewind those presidentially favored decisions, the majority\nprevents theories of formal presidential control from stymying the\nPresident\u2019s real-world ability to carry out his agenda. Similarly,\nthe majority\u2019s approach should help protect agency decisions that\nwould never have risen to the President\u2019s notice. Consider the\nhundreds of thousands of decisions that the Social Security\nAdministration (SSA) makes each year. The SSA has a single head\nwith for-cause removal protection; so a betting person might wager\nthat the agency\u2019s removal provision is next on the chopping block.\nCf.ante, at 32, n.\u00a021. But given the majority\u2019s\nremedial analysis, I doubt the mass of SSA decisions\u2014which would\nnot concern the President at all\u2014would need to be undone. That\nmakes sense. \u201c[P]residential control [does] not show itself in all,\nor even all important, regulation.\u201d Kagan, Presidential\nAdministration, 114 Harv. L.\u00a0Rev. 2245, 2250 (2001). When an\nagency decision would not capture a President\u2019s attention, his\nremoval authority could not make a difference\u2014and so no injunction\nshould issue.My final point relates to the last sentence of\nthe majority\u2019s remedial section. There, the Court holds that the\ndecisive question\u2014whether the removal provision mattered\u2014\u201cshould be\nresolved in the first instance by the lower courts.\u201dAnte,\nat 36. That remand follows the Court\u2019s usual practice: We are, as\nwe often say, not a \u201ccourt of first view.\u201dAlabamav.Shelton,535 U.S.\n654, 673 (2002). But here the lower court proceedings may be\nbrief indeed. As I read the opinion below, the Court of Appeals\nalready considered and decided the issue remanded today. The court\nnoted that all of the FHFA\u2019s policies were jointly \u201ccreated [by]\nthe FHFA and Treasury\u201d and that the Secretary of the Treasury is\n\u201csubject to at will removal by the President.\u201dCollinsv.Mnuchin, 938 F.3d 553, 594 (CA5 2019). For that reason, the\ncourt concluded, \u201cwe need not speculate about whether appropriate\npresidential oversight would have stopped\u201d the FHFA\u2019s actions.Ibid.\u201cWe know that the President, acting through the\nSecretary of the Treasury, could have stopped [them] but did not.\u201dIbid; seeibid., n.\u00a06 (noting that the\nplaintiffs\u2019 \u201callegations show that the President had oversight of\nthe action\u201d). That reasoning seems sufficient to answer the\nquestion the Court kicks back, and nothing prevents the Fifth\nCircuit from reiterating its analysis. So I join the Court\u2019s\nopinion on the understanding that this litigation could speedily\ncome to a close.",
