That provision serves\nto waive sovereign immunity from suit. Today, we consider how far\nthe waiver goes. We reject the view, adopted below and pressed by\nthe Government, that the TVA remains immune from all tort suits\narising from its performance of so-called discretionary functions.\nThe TVA\u2019s sue-and-be-sued clause is broad and contains no such\nlimit. Under the clause\u2014and consistent with our precedents\nconstruing similar ones\u2014the TVA is subject to suits challenging any\nof its commercial activities. The law thus places the TVA in the\nsame position as a private corporation supplying electricity. But\nthe TVA might have immunity from suits contesting one of its\ngovernmental activities, of a kind not typically carried out by\nprivate parties. We remand this case for consideration of whether\nthat limited immunity could apply here.ICongress created the TVA\u2014a \u201cwholly owned\npublic corporation of the United States\u201d\u2014in the throes of the Great\nDepression to promote the Tennessee Valley\u2019s economic development.TVAv.Hill,437 U.S.\n153, 157 (1978).In its early decades, the TVA focused\non reforesting the countryside, improving farmers\u2019 fertilization\npractices, and building dams on the Tennessee River. See Brief for\nRespondent 3. The corporation also soon began constructing new\npower plants for the region. And over the years, as it completed\nother projects, the TVA devoted more and more of its efforts to\nproducing and selling electric power. Today, the TVA operates\naround 60 power plants and provides electricity to more than nine\nmillion people in seven States. Seeid.,at 3\u20134. The rates\nit charges (along with the bonds it issues) bring in over $10\nbillion in annual revenues, making federal appropriations\nunnecessary. Seeibid.; GAO, FY 2018 Financial Report of the\nUnited\u00a0States Government 53 (GAO\u201319\u2013294R, 2019).As even that short description may suggest, the\nTVA is something of a hybrid, combining traditionally governmental\nfunctions with typically commercial ones. On the one hand, the TVA\npossesses powers and responsibilities reserved to sovereign actors.\nIt may, for example, \u201cexercise the right of eminent domain\u201d and\n\u201ccondemn all property\u201d necessary to carry out its goals. 16\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a7831c(h), (i). Similarly, it may appoint\nemployees as \u201claw enforcement agents\u201d with powers to investigate\ncrimes and make arrests. \u00a7831c\u20133(a); see \u00a7831c\u20133(b)(2). But on the\nother hand, much of what the TVA does could be done\u2014no,isdone routinely\u2014by non-governmental parties. Just as the TVA\nproduces and sells electricity in its region, privately owned power\ncompanies (e.g.,Con Edison, Dominion Energy) do so in\ntheirs. As to those commonplace commercial functions, the emphasis\nin the oft-used label \u201cpublic corporation\u201d rests heavily on the\nlatter word.Hill, 437 U.\u00a0S., at 157.In establishing this mixed entity, Congress\ndecided (as it had for similar government businesses) that the TVA\ncould \u201csue and be sued in its corporate name.\u201d \u00a7831c(b); see,e.g.,Reconstruction Finance Corporation Act, \u00a74, 47Stat. 6;\nFederal Home Loan Bank Act, \u00a712, 47Stat. 735. Without such a\nclause, the TVA (as an entity of the Fed- eral Government) would\nhave enjoyed sovereign immunity from suit. SeeLoefflerv.Frank,486 U.S.\n549, 554 (1988). By instead providing that the TVA could \u201cbe\nsued,\u201d Congress waived at least some of the corporation\u2019s immunity.\n(Just how much is the question here.) Slightly more than a decade\nafter creating the TVA, Congress enacted the Federal Tort Claims\nAct of 1946 (FTCA), 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a71346(b), 2671et\u00a0seq., to waive immunity from tort suits involving\nagencies across the Government. See \u00a71346(b)(1) (waiving immunity\nfrom damages claims based on \u201cthe negligent or wrongful act or\nomission of any employee of the Government\u201d). That statute carved\nout an exception for claims based on a federal employee\u2019s\nperformance of a \u201cdiscretionary function.\u201d \u00a72680(a). But Congress\nspecifically excluded from all the FTCA\u2019s provisions\u2014including the\ndiscretionary function exception\u2014\u201c[a]ny claim arising from the\nactivities of the [TVA].\u201d \u00a72680(l).This case involves such a claim. See App. 22\u201333\n(Complaint). One summer day, TVA employees embarked on work to\nreplace a power line over the Tennessee River. When a cable they\nwere using failed, the power line fell into the water. The TVA\ninformed the Coast Guard, which announced that it was closing part\nof the river; and the TVA itself positioned two patrol boats near\nthe downed line. But several hours later, just as the TVA workers\nbegan to raise the line, petitioner Gary Thacker drove his boat\ninto the area at high speed. The boat and line col- lided,\nseriously injuring Thacker and killing a passenger. Thacker sued\nfor negligence, alleging that the TVA had failed to \u201cexercise\nreasonable care\u201d in \u201cassembl[ing] and install[ing] power lines\u201d and\nin \u201cwarning boaters\u201d like him \u201cof the hazards it created.\u201dId.,at 31.The TVA moved to dismiss the suit, claiming\nsovereign immunity. The District Court granted the motion. It\nreasoned that the TVA, no less than other government agencies, is\nentitled to immunity from any suit based on an employee\u2019s exercise\nof discretionary functions. See 188 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d 1243, 1245 (ND\nAla. 2016). And it thought that the TVA\u2019s actions surrounding the\nboating accident were discretionary because \u201cthey involve[d] some\njudgment and choice.\u201dIbid.The Court of Appeals for the\nEleventh Circuit affirmed on the same ground. According to the\ncircuit court, the TVA has immunity for discretionary functions\neven when they are part of the \u201cTVA\u2019s commercial, power-generating\nactivities.\u201d 868 F.3d 979, 981 (2017). In deciding whether a suit\nimplicates those functions, the court explained that it \u201cuse[s] the\nsame test that applies when the government invokes the\ndiscretionary-function exception to the [FTCA].\u201dId.,at\n982. And that test, the court agreed, foreclosed Thacker\u2019s suit\nbecause the challenged actions were \u201ca matter of choice.\u201dIbid.(internal quotation marks omitted).We granted certiorari to decide whether the\nwaiver of sovereign immunity in TVA\u2019s sue-and-be-sued clause is\nsubject to a discretionary function exception, of the kind in the\nFTCA. 585 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2018). We hold it is not.IINothing in the statute establishing the TVA\n(again, the TVA Act for short) expressly recognizes immunity for\ndiscretionary functions. As noted above, that law provides simply\nthat the TVA \u201c[m]ay sue and be sued.\u201d 16 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7831c(b); seesupra,at 3. Such a sue-and-be-sued clause\nserves to waive sovereign immunity otherwise belonging to an agency\nof the Federal Government. SeeLoeffler, 486 U.\u00a0S., at\n554. By the TVA Act\u2019s terms, that waiver is subject to\n\u201c[e]xcept[ions] as \u201cspecifically provided in\u201d the statute itself.\n\u00a7831c. But the TVA Act contains no exceptions relevant to tort\nclaims, let alone one turning on whether the challenged conduct is\ndiscretionary.Nor does the FTCA\u2019s exception for discretionary\nfunctions apply to the TVA. As described earlier, seesupra,at 3, the FTCA retained the Federal Government\u2019s immunity from tort\nsuits challenging discretionary conduct, even while allowing other\ntort claims to go forward. See 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a71346(b),\n2680(a);United Statesv.Gaubert,499 U.S.\n315, 322\u2013325 (1991) (describing the discretionary function\nexception\u2019s scope). But Congress made clear that the FTCA does \u201cnot\napply to[] [a]ny claim arising from the activities of the [TVA].\u201d\n\u00a72680(l). That means the FTCA\u2019s discretionary function\nprovision has no relevance to this case. Even the Government\nconcedes as much. It acknowledges that the FTCA\u2019s discretionary\nfunction exception \u201cdoes not govern [Thacker\u2019s] suit.\u201d Brief for\nRespondent 15. Rather, it says, the TVA Act\u2019s sue-and-be-sued\nclause does so. Seeid.,at 6. And that is the very clause\nwe have just described as containing no express exception for\ndiscretionary functions.But that is not quite the end of the story\nbecause inFederal Housing Administrationv.Burr,309 U.S.\n242(1940), this Court recognized that a sue-and-be-sued clause\nmight contain \u201cimplied exceptions.\u201dId.,at 245. The Court\nin that case permitted a suit to proceed against a government\nentity (providing mortgage insurance) whose organic statute had a\nsue-and-be-sued clause much like the TVA Act\u2019s. And the Court made\nclear that in green-lighting the suit, it was doing what courts\nnormally should. Sue-and-be-sued clauses, the Court explained,\n\u201cshould be liberally construed.\u201dIbid.; seeFDICv.Meyer,510 U.S.\n471, 475 (1994) (similarly calling such clauses \u201cbroad\u201d). Those\nwords \u201cin their usual and ordinary sense,\u201d the Court noted,\n\u201cembrace all civil process incident to the commencement or\ncontinuance of legal proceedings.\u201dBurr, 309 U.\u00a0S., at\n245\u2013246. And Congress generally \u201cintend[s] the full consequences of\nwhat it sa[ys]\u201d\u2014even if \u201cinconvenient, costly, and inefficient.\u201dId.,at 249 (quotation modified). But not quite always, the\nCourt continued. And when not\u2014when Congress meant to use the words\n\u201csue and be sued\u201d in a more \u201cnarrow sense\u201d\u2014a court should recognize\n\u201can implied restriction.\u201dId.,at 245. In particular,Burrstated, a court should take that route if one of the\nfollowing circumstances is \u201cclearly shown\u201d: either the \u201ctype[] of\nsuit [at issue is] not consistent with the statutory or\nconstitutional scheme\u201d or the restriction is \u201cnecessary to avoid\ngrave interference with the performance of a governmental\nfunction.\u201dIbid.Although the courts below never consideredBurr, the Government tries to use its framework to defend\ntheir decisions. See Brief for Respondent 17\u201340. According to the\nGovernment, we should establish a limit on the TVA\u2019s\nsue-and-be-sued clause\u2014like the one in the FTCA\u2014for all suits\nchallenging discretionary functions. That is for two reasons,\ntrackingBurr\u2019s statement of when to recognize an \u201cimplied\nexception\u201d to a sue-and-be-sued clause. 309 U.\u00a0S., at 245.\nFirst, the Government argues that allowing those suits would\nconflict with the \u201cconstitutional scheme\u201d\u2014more precisely, with\n\u201cseparation-of-powers principles\u201d\u2014by subjecting the TVA\u2019s\ndiscretionary conduct to \u201cjudicial second-guessing.\u201d Brief for\nRespondent 19, 21 (internal quotation marks omitted). Second, the\nGovernment maintains that permitting those suits would necessarily\n\u201cinterfere[\u00a0] with important governmental functions.\u201dId.,at 36; seeid.,at 39\u201340; Tr. of Oral Arg.\n39\u201341. We disagree.At the outset, we balk at usingBurrto\nprovide a government entity excluded from the FTCA with a replica\nof that statute\u2019s discretionary function exception. Congress made a\nconsidered decisionnotto apply the FTCA to the TVA (even\nas Congress applied that legislation to some other public\ncorporations, see 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72679(a)). Seesupra,at 3, 5. The Government effectively asks us to negate\nthat legislative choice. Or otherwise put, it asks us to let the\nFTCA in through the back door, when Congress has locked the front\none. We have once before rejected such a maneuver. InFDICv.Meyer, a plaintiff brought a constitutional tort claim\nagainst a government agency with another broad sue-and-be-sued\nclause. The agency claimed immunity, stressing that the claim would\nhave fallen outside the FTCA\u2019s immunity waiver (which extends only\nto conventional torts). We dismissed the argument. \u201cIn essence,\u201d we\nobserved, the \u201cFDIC asks us to engraft\u201d a part of the FTCA \u201conto\n[the agency\u2019s] sue-and-be-sued clause.\u201d 510 U.\u00a0S., at 480. But\nthat would mean doing what Congress had not. Seeid.,at\n483. And so too here, if we were to bestow the FTCA\u2019s discretionary\nfunction exception on the TVA through the conduit ofBurr.\nIndeed, the Government\u2019s proposal would make the TVA\u2019s tort\nliability largely coextensive with that of all the agencies the\nFTCA governs. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 33\u201334. Far from acting to\nachieve such parity, Congress did everything possible to avoid\nit.In any event, the Government is wrong to think\nthat waiving the TVA\u2019s immunity from suits based on discretionary\nfunctions would offend the separation of powers. As this Court\nexplained inBurr, the scope of immunity that federal\ncorporations enjoy is up to Congress. That body \u201chas full power to\nendow [such an entity] with the government\u2019s immunity from suit.\u201d\n309 U.\u00a0S., at 244. And equally, it has full power to \u201cwaive\n[that] immunity\u201d and \u201csubject[ the entity] to the judicial process\u201d\nto whatever extent it wishes.Ibid.When Congress takes the\nlatter route\u2014even when it goes so far as to waive the corporation\u2019s\nimmunity for discretionary functions\u2014its action raises no\nseparation of powers problems. The right governmental actor\n(Congress) is making a decision within its bailiwick (to waive\nimmunity) that authorizes an appropriate body (a court) to render a\nlegal judgment. Indeed, the Government itself conceded at oral\nargument that Congress, when creating a public corporation, may\nconstitutionally waive its \u201cimmunity [for] discretionary\nfunctions.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 37. But once that is acknowledged, the\nGovernment\u2019s argument from \u201cseparation-of-powers principles\u201d\ncollapses. Brief for Respondent 19. Those principles can offer no\nreason to limit a statutory waiver that even without any emendation\ncomplies with the constitutional scheme.Finally, the Government overreaches when it says\nthat all suits based on the TVA\u2019s discretionary conduct will\n\u201cgrave[ly] interfere[]\u201d with \u201cgovernmental function[s].\u201dBurr, 309 U.\u00a0S., at 245. That is so, at the least,\nbecause the discretionary acts of hybrid entities like the TVA may\nbe not governmental but commercial in nature. And a suit\nchallenging a commercial act will not \u201cgrave[ly]\u201d\u2014or, indeed, at\nall\u2014interfere with the \u201cgovernmental functions\u201dBurrcared\nabout protecting. The Government contests that point, arguing that\nthis Court has not meant to distinguish between the governmental\nand the commercial in construing sue-and-be-sued clauses. See Brief\nfor Respondent 39\u201340. But bothBurrand later decisions do\nso explicitly.Burrtook as its \u201cpremise\u201d that an agency\n\u201claunched [with such a clause] into the commercial world\u201d and\n\u201cauthorize[d]\u00a0to engage\u201d in \u201cbusiness transactions with the\npublic\u201d should have the same \u201camenab[ility] to judicial process\n[as] a private enterprise under like circumstances.\u201d 309\nU.\u00a0S., at 245.Meyeralso made clear that such an\nagency \u201ccould not escape the liability a private enterprise would\nface in similar circumstances.\u201d 510 U.\u00a0S., at 482; seeibid.(\u201c[T]he liability of a private enterprise [is] afloorbelow which the agency\u2019s liability [may] not fall\u201d).\nAnd twice the Court held that the liability of the Postal Service\n(another sue-and-be-sued agency) should be \u201csimilar[\u00a0] to\n[that of] other self-sustaining commercial ventures.\u201dFranchise\nTax Bd. of Cal.v.Postal Service,467 U.S.\n512, 525 (1984); seeLoeffler, 486 U.\u00a0S., at 556.\nThe point of those decisions, contra the Government, is that\n(barring special constitutional or statutory issues not present\nhere) suits based on a public corporation\u2019scommercialactivity may proceed as they would against a private company; only\nsuits challenging the entity\u2019sgovernmentalactivity may run\ninto an implied limit on its sue-and-be-sued clause.Burrand its progeny thus require a far\nmore refined analysis than the Government offers here. The reasons\nthose decisions give to recognize a restriction on a\nsue-and-be-sued clause do not justify the wholesale incorporation\nof the discretionary function exception. As explained above, the\n\u201cconstitutional scheme\u201d has nothing to say about lawsuits\nchallenging a public corporation\u2019s discretionary activity\u2014except to\nleave their fate to Congress.Burr, 309 U.\u00a0S., at 245;\nseesupra,at 8. For its part, Congress has not said in\nenacting sue-and-be-sued clauses that it wants to prohibit all such\nsuits\u2014quite the contrary. And no concern for \u201cgovernmental\nfunctions\u201d can immunize discretionary activities that are\ncommercial in kind.Burr, 309 U.\u00a0S., at 245; seesupra,at 8\u20139. When the TVA or similar body operates in the\nmarketplace as private companies do, it is as liable as they are\nfor choices and judgments. The possibility of immunity arises only\nwhen a suit challenges governmental activities\u2014the kinds of\nfunctions private parties typically do not perform. And even then,\nan entity with a sue-and-be-sued clause may receive immunity only\nif it is \u201cclearly shown\u201d that prohibiting the \u201ctype[\u00a0] of suit\n[at issue] is necessary to avoid grave interference\u201d with a\ngovernmental function\u2019s performance.Burr, 309 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 245. That is a high bar. But it is no higher than appropriate\ngiven Congress\u2019s enactment of so broad an immunity waiver\u2014which\ndemands, as we have held, a \u201cliberal construction.\u201dIbid.(quotation modified).IIIAll that remains is to decide this case in\naccord with what we have said so far. But as we often note at this\npoint, \u201cwe are a court of review, not of first view.\u201dCutterv.Wilkinson,544 U.S.\n709, 718, n.\u00a07 (2005). In wrongly relying on the\ndiscretionary function exception, the courts below never addressed\nthe issues we have found relevant in deciding whether this suit may\ngo forward. Those courts should have the first chance to do so, as\nguided by the principles set out above and a few last remarks about\napplying them here.As described earlier, the TVA sometimes\nresembles a government actor, sometimes a commercial one. Seesupra,at 2\u20133. Consider a few diverse examples. When the TVA\nexercises the power of eminent domain, taking landowners\u2019 property\nfor public purposes, no one would confuse it for a private company.\nSo too when the TVA exercises its law enforcement powers to arrest\nindividuals. But in other operations\u2014and over the years, a growing\nnumber\u2014the TVA acts like any other company producing and supplying\nelectric power. It is an accident of history, not a difference in\nfunction, that explains why most Tennesseans get their electricity\nfrom a public enterprise and most Virginians get theirs from a\nprivate one. Whatever their ownership structures, the two companies\ndo basically the same things to deliver power to customers.So to determine if the TVA has immunity here,\nthe court on remand must first decide whether the conduct alleged\nto be negligent is governmental or commercial in nature. For the\nreasons given above, if the conduct is commercial\u2014the kind of thing\nany power company might do\u2014the TVA cannot invoke sovereign\nimmunity. In that event, the TVA\u2019s sue-and-be-sued clause renders\nit liable to the same extent as a private party. Only if the\nconduct at issue is governmental might the court decide that an\nimplied limit on the clause bars the suit. But even assuming\ngovernmental activity, the court must find that prohibiting the\n\u201ctype[] of suit [at issue] is necessary to avoid grave\ninterference\u201d with that function\u2019s performance.Burr,309\nU.\u00a0S., at 245. Unless it is, Congress\u2019s express statement that\nthe TVA may \u201cbe sued\u201d continues to demand that this suit go\nforward.We accordingly reverse the judgment of the Court\nof Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings consistent\nwith this opinion.It is so ordered.",
