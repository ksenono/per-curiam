S. ____ (2007)SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESNO. 06-427TENNESSEE SECONDARY SCHOOL ATHLETIC ASSOCIATION,\nPETITIONERv.BRENTWOOD ACADEMYon writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the sixth circuit[June 21, 2007]Justice Thomas, concurring in the\njudgment.In resolving this case, the Court\napplies thePickeringv.Board of Ed. of Township High\nSchool Dist. 205, Will Cty.,391 U. S. 563(1968),\nline of cases to hold that the Tennessee Secondary School Athletic\nAssociation (TSSAA) did not violate Brentwood\u2019s First Amendment\nrights.Ante, at 7\u20138. Until today,Pickeringgoverned limitations on the speech rights of government employees\nand contractors. The Court uprootsPickeringfrom its\ncontext and applies it to speech by a private school that is a\nmember of a private athletic association. The need to stretchPickeringto fit this case was occasioned by the Court\nwhen it held that TSSAA, a private organization, was a state actor.Brentwood Academyv.Tennessee Secondary School\nAthletic Assn.,531 U. S. 288(2001)(Brentwood I).BecauseBrentwood Ideparted so\ndramatically from our earlier state-action cases, it is\nunsurprising that no First Amendment framework readily applies to\nthis case. Rather than going through the bizarre exercise of\nextending obviously inapplicable First Amendment doctrine to these\ncircumstances, I would simply overruleBrentwoodI.* Seeid., at 305\u2013315 (Thomas, J., dissenting).The Court\u2019s extension ofPickeringto\nthis context is therefore unnecessary, but the principal opinion\u2019s\napplication ofOhralikv.Ohio State Bar Assn.,436 U. S. 447(1978),ante, at 4\u20136, is outright wrong. For the reasons\nexpressed in Justice Kennedy\u2019s opinion concurring in part and\nconcurring in the judgment,ante, at 1\u20132,Ohralikis a narrow rule addressed to a particular context that has no\napplication to the facts of this case. For these reasons, I concur\nin the Court\u2019s judgment.*\u00a0Holding that TSSAA is not a state actor\nwould also resolve Brentwood\u2019s due process claim.",
