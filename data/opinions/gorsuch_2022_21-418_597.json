KENNEDY, PETITIONERv.BREMERTON SCHOOL DISTRICTon writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the ninth circuit[June 27, 2022]Justice Gorsuch delivered the opinion of the\nCourt.Joseph Kennedy lost his job as a high school\nfootball coach because he knelt at midfield after games to offer a\nquiet prayer of thanks. Mr. Kennedy prayed during a period when\nschool employees were free to speak with a friend, call for a\nreservation at a restaurant, check email, or attend to other\npersonal matters. He offered his prayers quietly while his students\nwere otherwise occupied. Still, the Bremerton School District\ndisciplined him anyway. It did so because it thought anything less\ncould lead a reasonable observer to conclude (mistakenly) that it\nendorsed Mr. Kennedy\u2019s religious beliefs. That reasoning was\nmisguided. Both the Free Exercise and Free Speech Clauses of the\nFirst Amendment protect expressions like Mr. Kennedy\u2019s. Nor does a\nproper understanding of the Amendment\u2019s Establishment Clause\nrequire the government to single out private religious speech for\nspecial disfavor. The Constitution and the best of our traditions\ncounsel mutual respect and tolerance, not censorship and\nsuppression, for religious and nonreligious views alike.IAJoseph Kennedy began working as a football\ncoach at Bremerton High School in 2008 after nearly two decades of\nservice in the Marine Corps. App. 167. Like many other football\nplayers and coaches across the country, Mr. Kennedy made it a\npractice to give \u201cthanks through prayer on the playing field\u201d at\nthe conclusion of each game.Id., at 168, 171. In his\nprayers, Mr. Kennedy sought to express gratitude for \u201cwhat the\nplayers had accomplished and for the opportunity to be part of\ntheir lives through the game of football.\u201dId., at 168. Mr.\nKennedy offered his prayers after the players and coaches had\nshaken hands, by taking a knee at the 50-yard line and praying\n\u201cquiet[ly]\u201d for \u201capproximately 30 seconds.\u201dId., at\n168\u2013169.Initially, Mr. Kennedy prayed on his own. Seeibid.But over time, some players asked whether they could\npray alongside him. 991 F.3d 1004, 1010 (CA9 2021); App. 169. Mr.\nKennedy responded by saying, \u201c\u00a0\u2018This is a free country. You\ncan do what you want.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIbid.The number of players\nwho joined Mr. Kennedy eventually grew to include most of the team,\nat least after some games. Sometimes team members invited opposing\nplayers to join. Other times Mr. Kennedy still prayed alone. Seeibid. Eventually, Mr. Kennedy began incorporating short\nmotivational speeches with his prayer when others were present. Seeid., at 170. Separately, the team at times engaged in\npregame or postgame prayers in the locker room. It seems this\npractice was a \u201cschool tradition\u201d that predated Mr. Kennedy\u2019s\ntenure.Ibid. Mr. Kennedy explained that he \u201cnever told any\nstudent that it was important they participate in any religious\nactivity.\u201dIbid. In particular, he \u201cnever pressured or\nencouraged any student to join\u201d his postgame midfield prayers.Ibid.For over seven years, no one complained to the\nBremerton School District (District) about these practices. Seeid., at 63\u201364. It seems the District\u2019s superintendent first\nlearned of them only in September 2015, after an employee from\nanother school commented positively on the school\u2019s practices to\nBremerton\u2019s principal. Seeid., at 109, 229. At that point,\nthe District reacted quickly. On September 17, the superintendent\nsent Mr. Kennedy a letter. In it, the superintendent identified\n\u201ctwo problematic practices\u201d in which Mr. Kennedy had engaged. App.\n40. First, Mr. Kennedy had provided \u201cinspirational talk[s]\u201d that\nincluded \u201covertly religious references\u201d likely constituting\n\u201cprayer\u201d with the students \u201cat midfield following the completion of\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. game[s].\u201dIbid.Second, he had led \u201cstudents\nand coaching staff in a prayer\u201d in the locker-room tradition that\n\u201cpredated [his] involvement with the program.\u201dId., at\n41.The District explained that it sought to\nestablish \u201cclear parameters\u201d \u201cgoing forward.\u201dIbid. It\ninstructed Mr. Kennedy to avoid any motivational \u201ctalks with\nstudents\u201d that \u201cinclude[d] religious expression, including prayer,\u201d\nand to avoid \u201csuggest[ing], encourag[ing] (or discourag[ing]), or\nsupervis[ing]\u201d any prayers of students, which students remained\nfree to \u201cengage in.\u201dId., at 44. The District also explained\nthat any religious activity on Mr. Kennedy\u2019s part must be\n\u201cnondemonstrative (i.e., not outwardly discernible as\nreligious activity)\u201d if \u201cstudents are also engaged in religious\nconduct\u201d in order to \u201cavoid the perception of endorsement.\u201dId., at 45. In offering these directives, the District\nappealed to what it called a \u201cdirect tension between\u201d the\n\u201cEstablishment Clause\u201d and \u201ca school employee\u2019s [right to] free[ly]\nexercise\u201d his religion.Id., at 43. To resolve that\n\u201ctension,\u201d the District explained, an employee\u2019s free exercise\nrights \u201cmust yield so far as necessary to avoid school endorsement\nof religious activities.\u201dIbid.After receiving the District\u2019s September 17\nletter, Mr. Kennedy ended the tradition, predating him, of offering\nlocker-room prayers.Id., at 40\u201341, 77, 170\u2013172. He also\nended his practice of incorporating religious references or prayer\ninto his postgame motivational talks to his team on the field. Seeibid.Mr. Kennedy further felt pressured to abandon his\npractice of saying his own quiet, on-field postgame prayer. Seeid., at 172. Driving home after a game, however, Mr. Kennedy\nfelt upset that he had \u201cbroken [his] commitment to God\u201d by not\noffering his own prayer, so he turned his car around and returned\nto the field.Ibid.By that point, everyone had left the\nstadium, and he walked to the 50-yard line and knelt to say a brief\nprayer of thanks. Seeibid.On October 14, through counsel, Mr. Kennedy sent\na letter to school officials informing them that, because of his\n\u201csincerely-held religious beliefs,\u201d he felt \u201ccompelled\u201d to offer a\n\u201cpost-game personal prayer\u201d of thanks at midfield.Id., at\n62\u201363, 172. He asked the District to allow him to continue that\n\u201cprivate religious expression\u201d alone.Id., at 62. Consistent\nwith the District\u2019s policy, seeid., at 48, Mr. Kennedy\nexplained that he \u201cneither requests, encourages, nor discourages\nstudents from participating in\u201d these prayers,id., at 64.\nMr. Kennedy emphasized that he sought only the opportunity to\n\u201cwai[t] until the game is over and the players have left the field\nand then wal[k] to mid-field to say a short, private, personal\nprayer.\u201dId., at 69. He \u201ctold everybody\u201d that it would be\nacceptable to him to pray \u201cwhen the kids went away from [him].\u201dId., at 292. He later clarified that this meant he was even\nwilling to say his \u201cprayer while the players were walking to the\nlocker room\u201d or \u201cbus,\u201d and then catch up with his team.Id.,\nat 280\u2013282; see alsoid., at 59. However, Mr. Kennedy\nobjected to the logical implication of the District\u2019s September 17\nletter, which he understood as banning him \u201cfrom bowing his head\u201d\nin the vicinity of students, and as requiring him to \u201cflee the\nscene if students voluntarily [came] to the same area\u201d where he was\npraying.Id., at 70. After all, District policy prohibited\nhim from \u201cdiscourag[ing]\u201d independent student decisions to pray.Id., at 44.On October 16, shortly before the game that day,\nthe District responded with another letter. Seeid., at 76.\nThe District acknowledged that Mr. Kennedy \u201cha[d] complied\u201d with\nthe \u201cdirectives\u201d in its September 17 letter.Id., at 77. Yet\ninstead of accommodating Mr. Kennedy\u2019s request to offer a brief\nprayer on the field while students were busy with other\nactivities\u2014whether heading to the locker room, boarding the bus, or\nperhaps singing the school fight song\u2014the District issued an\nultimatum. It forbade Mr. Kennedy from engaging in \u201cany overt\nactions\u201d that could \u201cappea[r] to a reasonable observer to endorse\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. prayer .\u00a0.\u00a0. while he is on duty as a\nDistrict-paid coach.\u201dId., at 81. The District did so\nbecause it judged that anything less would lead it to violate the\nEstablishment Clause.Ibid.BAfter receiving this letter, Mr. Kennedy\noffered a brief prayer following the October 16 game. Seeid., at 90. When he bowed his head at midfield after the\ngame, \u201cmost [Bremerton] players were .\u00a0.\u00a0. engaged in the\ntraditional singing of the school fight song to the audience.\u201dIbid. Though Mr. Kennedy was alone when he began to pray,\nplayers from the other team and members of the community joined him\nbefore he finished his prayer. Seeid., at 82, 297. This\nevent spurred media coverage of Mr. Kennedy\u2019s dilemma and a public\nresponse from the District. The District placed robocalls to\nparents to inform them that public access to the field is\nforbidden; it posted signs and made announcements at games saying\nthe same thing; and it had the Bremerton Police secure the field in\nfuture games.Id., at 100\u2013101, 354\u2013355. Subsequently, the\nDistrict superintendent explained in an October 20 email to the\nleader of a state association of school administrators that \u201cthe\ncoach moved on from leading prayer with kids, to taking a silent\nprayer at the 50 yard line.\u201dId., at 83. The official with\nwhom the superintendent corresponded acknowledged that the \u201cuse of\na silent prayer changes the equation a bit.\u201dIbid. On\nOctober 21, the superintendent further observed to a state official\nthat \u201c[t]he issue is quickly changing as it has shifted from\nleading prayer with student athletes, to a coaches [sic]\nright to conduct\u201d his own prayer \u201con the 50 yard line.\u201dId.,\nat 88.On October 23, shortly before that evening\u2019s\ngame, the District wrote Mr. Kennedy again. It expressed\n\u201cappreciation\u201d for his \u201cefforts to comply\u201d with the District\u2019s\ndirectives, including avoiding \u201con-the-job prayer with players in\nthe\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. football program, both in the locker room\nprior to games as well as on the field immediately following\ngames.\u201dId., at 90. The letter also admitted that, during\nMr. Kennedy\u2019s recent October 16 postgame prayer, his students were\notherwise engaged and not praying with him, and that his prayer was\n\u201cfleeting.\u201dId., at 90, 93. Still, the District explained\nthat a \u201creasonable observer\u201d could think government endorsement of\nreligion had occurred when a \u201cDistrict employee, on the field only\nby virtue of his employment with the District, still on duty\u201d\nengaged in \u201covertly religious conduct.\u201dId., at 91, 93. The\nDistrict thus made clear that the only option it would offer Mr.\nKennedy was to allow him to pray after a game in a \u201cprivate\nlocation\u201d behind closed doors and \u201cnot observable to students or\nthe public.\u201dId., at 93\u201394.After the October 23 game ended, Mr. Kennedy\nknelt at the 50-yard line, where \u201cno one joined him,\u201d and bowed his\nhead for a \u201cbrief, quiet prayer.\u201d 991 F.\u00a03d, at 1019; App.\n173, 236\u2013239. The superintendent informed the District\u2019s board that\nthis prayer \u201cmoved closer to what we want,\u201d but nevertheless\nremained \u201cunconstitutional.\u201dId., at 96. After the final\nrelevant football game on October 26, Mr. Kennedy again knelt alone\nto offer a brief prayer as the players engaged in postgame\ntraditions. 443 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d 1223, 1231 (WD Wash. 2020); App.\nto Pet. for Cert. 182. While he was praying, other adults gathered\naround him on the field. See 443 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at 1231; App.\n97. Later, Mr. Kennedy rejoined his players for a postgame talk,\nafter they had finished singing the school fight song. 443\nF.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at 1231; App. 103.CShortly after the October 26 game, the\nDistrict placed Mr. Kennedy on paid administrative leave and\nprohibited him from \u201cparticipat[ing], in any capacity, in\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. football program activities.\u201dIbid.In a\nletter explaining the reasons for this disciplinary action, the\nsuperintendent criticized Mr. Kennedy for engaging in \u201cpublic and\ndemonstrative religious conduct while still on duty as an assistant\ncoach\u201d by offering a prayer following the games on October 16, 23,\nand 26.Id., at 102. The letter did not allege that Mr.\nKennedy performed these prayers with students, and it acknowledged\nthat his prayers took place while students were engaged in\nunrelated postgame activities.Id., at 103. Additionally,\nthe letter faulted Mr. Kennedy for not being willing to pray behind\nclosed doors.Id., at 102.In an October 28 Q&A document provided to\nthe public, the District admitted that it possessed \u201cno evidence\nthat students have been directly coerced to pray with Kennedy.\u201dId., at 105. The Q&A also acknowledged that Mr. Kennedy\n\u201cha[d] complied\u201d with the District\u2019s instruction to refrain from\nhis \u201cprior practices of leading players in a pre-game prayer in the\nlocker room or leading players in a post-game prayer immediately\nfollowing games.\u201dIbid.But the Q&A asserted that the\nDistrict could not allow Mr. Kennedy to \u201cengage in a public\nreligious display.\u201dId., at 105, 107, 110. Otherwise, the\nDistrict would \u201cviolat[e] the .\u00a0.\u00a0. Establishment Clause\u201d\nbecause \u201creasonable .\u00a0.\u00a0. students and attendees\u201d might\nperceive the \u201cdistrict [as] endors[ing] .\u00a0.\u00a0. religion.\u201dId., at 105.While Mr. Kennedy received \u201cuniformly positive\nevaluations\u201d every other year of his coaching career, after the\n2015 season ended in November, the District gave him a poor\nperformance evaluation.Kennedyv.Bremerton School\nDist., 869 F.3d 813, 820 (CA9 2017). The evaluation advised\nagainst rehiring Mr. Kennedy on the grounds that he \u201c\u00a0\u2018failed\nto follow district policy\u2019\u00a0\u201d regarding religious expression\nand \u201c\u00a0\u2018failed to supervise student-athletes after\ngames.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIbid.Mr. Kennedy did not return for the next\nseason.Ibid.IIAAfter these events, Mr. Kennedy sued in\nfederal court, alleging that the District\u2019s actions violated the\nFirst Amendment\u2019s Free Speech and Free Exercise Clauses. App. 145,\n160\u2013164. He also moved for a preliminary injunction requiring the\nDistrict to reinstate him. The District Court denied that motion,\nconcluding that a \u201creasonable observer\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. would\nhave seen him as .\u00a0.\u00a0. leading an orchestrated session of\nfaith.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 303. Indeed, if the District had not\nsuspended him, the court agreed, it might have violated the\nConstitution\u2019s Establishment Clause. Seeid., at 302\u2013303. On\nappeal, the Ninth Circuit affirmed.Kennedy, 869 F.\u00a03d,\nat 831.Following the Ninth Circuit\u2019s ruling, Mr.\nKennedy sought certiorari in this Court. The Court denied the\npetition. But Justice Alito, joined by three other Members of the\nCourt, issued a statement stressing that \u201cdenial of certiorari does\nnot signify that the Court necessarily agrees with the decision\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. below.\u201dKennedyv.Bremerton School\nDist., 586 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2019) (slip op., at 1). Justice\nAlito expressed concerns with the lower courts\u2019 decisions,\nincluding the possibility that, under their reasoning, teachers\nmight be \u201cordered not to engage in any \u2018demonstrative\u2019 conduct of a\nreligious nature\u201d within view of students, even to the point of\nbeing forbidden from \u201cfolding their hands or bowing their heads in\nprayer\u201d before lunch.Id., at ___\n(slip\u00a0op.,\u00a0at\u00a04).BAfter the case returned to the District Court,\nthe parties engaged in discovery and eventually brought\ncross-motions for summary judgment. At the end of that process, the\nDistrict Court found that the \u201c\u00a0\u2018sole reason\u2019\u00a0\u201d for the\nDistrict\u2019s decision to suspend Mr. Kennedy was its perceived \u201crisk\nof constitutional liability\u201d under the Establishment Clause for his\n\u201creligious conduct\u201d after the October 16, 23, and 26 games. 443\nF.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at 1231.The court found that reason persuasive too.\nRejecting Mr. Kennedy\u2019s free speech claim, the court concluded that\nbecause Mr. Kennedy \u201cwas hired precisely to occupy\u201d an \u201cinfluential\nrole for student athletes,\u201d any speech he uttered was offered in\nhis capacity as a government employee and unprotected by the First\nAmendment.Id., at 1237. Alternatively, even if Mr.\nKennedy\u2019s speech qualified as private speech, the District Court\nreasoned, the District properly suppressed it. Had it done\notherwise, the District would have invited \u201can Establishment Clause\nviolation.\u201dIbid.Turning to Mr. Kennedy\u2019s free exercise\nclaim, the District Court held that, even if the District\u2019s\npolicies restricting his religious exercise were not neutral toward\nreligion or generally applicable, the District had a compelling\ninterest in prohibiting his postgame prayers, because, once more,\nhad it \u201callow[ed]\u201d them it \u201cwould have violated the Establishment\nClause.\u201dId., at 1240.CThe Ninth Circuit affirmed. It agreed with the\nDistrict Court that Mr. Kennedy\u2019s speech qualified as government\nrather than private speech because \u201chis expression on the field\u2014a\nlocation that he only had access to because of his\nemployment\u2014during a time when he was generally tasked with\ncommunicating with students, was speech as a government employee.\u201d\n991 F.\u00a03d, at 1015. Like the District Court, the Ninth Circuit\nfurther reasoned that, \u201ceven if we were to assume .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nthat Kennedy spoke as a private citizen,\u201d the District had an\n\u201cadequate justification\u201d for its actions.Id., at 1016.\nAccording to the court, \u201cKennedy\u2019s on-field religious activity,\u201d\ncoupled with what the court called \u201chis pugilistic efforts to\ngenerate publicity in order to gain approval of those on-field\nreligious activities,\u201d were enough to lead an \u201cobjective observer\u201d\nto conclude that the District \u201cendorsed Kennedy\u2019s religious\nactivity by not stopping the practice.\u201dId., at 1017\u20131018.\nAnd that, the court held, would amount to a violation of the\nEstablishment Clause.Ibid.The Court of Appeals rejected Mr. Kennedy\u2019s free\nexercise claim for similar reasons. The District \u201cconcede[d]\u201d that\nits policy that led to Mr. Kennedy\u2019s suspension was not \u201cneutral\nand generally applicable\u201d and instead \u201crestrict[ed] Kennedy\u2019s\nreligious conduct because the conduct [was] religious.\u201dId.,\nat 1020. Still, the court ruled, the District \u201chad a compelling\nstate interest to avoid violating the Establishment Clause,\u201d and\nits suspension was narrowly tailored to vindicate that interest.Id., at 1020\u20131021.Later, the Ninth Circuit denied a petition to\nrehear the case en banc over the dissents of 11 judges. 4 F. 4th\n910, 911 (2021). Among other things, the dissenters argued that the\npanel erred by holding that a failure to discipline Mr. Kennedy\nwould have led the District to violate the Establishment Clause.\nSeveral dissenters noted that the panel\u2019s analysis rested onLemonv.Kurtzman,403 U.S.\n602(1971), and its progeny for the proposition that the\nEstablishment Clause is implicated whenever a hypothetical\nreasonable observer could conclude the government endorses\nreligion. 4 F. 4th, at 945\u2013947 (opinion of R. Nelson, J.). These\ndissenters argued that this Court has long since abandoned that\n\u201cahistorical, atextual\u201d approach to discerning \u201cEstablishment\nClause violations\u201d; they observed that other courts around the\ncountry have followed suit by renouncing it too; and they contended\nthat the panel should have likewise \u201crecognizedLemon\u2019s\ndemise and wisely left it dead.\u201dIbid., and n. 3. We granted\ncertiorari. 595 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2022).IIINow before us, Mr. Kennedy renews his argument\nthat the District\u2019s conduct violated both the Free Exercise and\nFree Speech Clauses of the First Amendment. These Clauses work in\ntandem. Where the Free Exercise Clause protects religious\nexercises, whether communicative or not, the Free Speech Clause\nprovides overlapping protection for expressive religious\nactivities. See,e.g.,Widmarv.Vincent,454 U.S.\n263, 269, n.\u00a06 (1981);Rosenbergerv.Rector and\nVisitors of Univ. of Va.,515 U.S.\n819, 841 (1995). That the First Amendment doubly protects\nreligious speech is no accident. It is a natural outgrowth of the\nframers\u2019 distrust of government attempts to regulate religion and\nsuppress dissent. See,e.g., A Memorial and Remonstrance\nAgainst Religious Assessments, in Selected Writings of James\nMadison 21, 25 (R. Ketcham ed. 2006). \u201c[I]n Anglo\u2013American history,\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. government suppression of speech has so commonly\nbeen directedpreciselyat religious speech that a\nfree-speech clause without religion would be Hamlet without the\nprince.\u201dCapitol Square Review and Advisory Bd.v.Pinette,515 U.S.\n753, 760 (1995).Under this Court\u2019s precedents, a plaintiff bears\ncertain burdens to demonstrate an infringement of his rights under\nthe Free Exercise and Free Speech Clauses. If the plaintiff carries\nthese burdens, the focus then shifts to the defendant to show that\nits actions were nonetheless justified and tailored consistent with\nthe demands of our case law. See,e.g.,Fultonv.Philadelphia, 593 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___\u2013___, ___ (2021) (slip\nop., at 4\u20135, 13);Reedv.Town of Gilbert, 576 U.S.\n155, 171 (2015);Garcettiv.Ceballos,547\nU.S. 410, 418 (2006);Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye,Inc.v.Hialeah,508 U.S.\n520, 546 (1993);Sherbertv.Verner,374 U.S.\n398, 403 (1963). We begin by examining whether Mr. Kennedy has\ndischarged his burdens, first under the Free Exercise Clause, then\nunder the Free Speech Clause.AThe Free Exercise Clause provides that\n\u201cCongress shall make no law .\u00a0.\u00a0. prohibiting the free\nexercise\u201d of religion. Amdt. 1. This Court has held the Clause\napplicable to the States under the terms of the Fourteenth\nAmendment.Cantwellv.Connecticut,310 U.S.\n296, 303 (1940). The Clause protects not only the right to\nharbor religious beliefs inwardly and secretly. It does perhaps its\nmost important work by protecting the ability of those who hold\nreligious beliefs of all kinds to live out their faiths in daily\nlife through \u201cthe performance of (or abstention from) physical\nacts.\u201dEmployment Div.,Dept. of Human Resources of\nOre.v.Smith,494 U.S.\n872, 877 (1990).Under this Court\u2019s precedents, a plaintiff may\ncarry the burden of proving a free exercise violation in various\nways, including by showing that a government entity has burdened\nhis sincere religious practice pursuant to a policy that is not\n\u201cneutral\u201d or \u201cgenerally applicable.\u201dId., at 879\u2013881. Should\na plaintiff make a showing like that, this Court will find a First\nAmendment violation unless the government can satisfy \u201cstrict\nscrutiny\u201d by demonstrating its course was justified by a compelling\nstate interest and was narrowly tailored in pursuit of that\ninterest.Lukumi, 508 U.\u00a0S., at 546.[1]That Mr. Kennedy has discharged his burdens is\neffectively undisputed. No one questions that he seeks to engage in\na sincerely motivated religious exercise. The exercise in question\ninvolves, as Mr. Kennedy has put it, giving \u201cthanks through prayer\u201d\nbriefly and by himself \u201con the playing field\u201d at the conclusion of\neach game he coaches. App. 168, 171. Mr. Kennedy has indicated\nrepeatedly that he is willing to \u201cwai[t] until the game is over and\nthe players have left the field\u201d to \u201cwal[k] to mid-field to say\n[his] short, private, personal prayer.\u201dId., at 69; see alsoid., at 280, 282. The contested exercise before us does not\ninvolve leading prayers with the team or before any other captive\naudience. Mr. Kennedy\u2019s \u201creligious beliefs do not require [him] to\nlead any prayer .\u00a0.\u00a0. involving students.\u201dId., at\n170. At the District\u2019s request, he voluntarily discontinued the\nschool tradition of locker-room prayers and his postgame religious\ntalks to students. The District disciplined himonlyfor his\ndecision to persist in praying quietly without his players after\nthree games in October 2015. See Parts I\u2013B and I\u2013C,supra.Nor does anyone question that, in forbidding Mr.\nKennedy\u2019s brief prayer, the District failed to act pursuant to a\nneutral and generally applicable rule. A government policy will not\nqualify as neutral if it is \u201cspecifically directed at\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. religious practice.\u201dSmith, 494 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 878. A policy can fail this test if it \u201cdiscriminate[s] on its\nface,\u201d or if a religious exercise is otherwise its \u201cobject.\u201dLukumi, 508 U.\u00a0S., at 533; see alsoSmith, 494\nU.\u00a0S., at 878. A government policy will fail the general\napplicability requirement if it \u201cprohibits religious conduct while\npermitting secular conduct that undermines the government\u2019s\nasserted interests in a similar way,\u201d or if it provides \u201ca\nmechanism for individualized exemptions.\u201dFulton, 593\nU.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 6). Failing either the neutrality\nor general applicability test is sufficient to trigger strict\nscrutiny. SeeLukumi, 508 U.\u00a0S., at 546.In this case, the District\u2019s challenged policies\nwere neither neutral nor generally applicable. By its own\nadmission, the District sought to restrict Mr. Kennedy\u2019s actions at\nleast in part because of their religious character. As it put it in\nits September 17 letter, the District prohibited \u201cany overt actions\non Mr. Kennedy\u2019s part, appearing to a reasonable observer to\nendorse even voluntary, student-initiated prayer.\u201d App. 81. The\nDistrict further explained that it could not allow \u201can employee,\nwhile still on duty, to engage inreligiousconduct.\u201dId., at 106 (emphasis added). Prohibiting a religious\npractice was thus the District\u2019s unquestioned \u201cobject.\u201d The\nDistrict candidly acknowledged as much below, conceding that its\npolicies were \u201cnot neutral\u201d toward religion. 991 F.\u00a03d, at\n1020.The District\u2019s challenged policies also fail the\ngeneral applicability test. The District\u2019s performance evaluation\nafter the 2015 football season advised against rehiring Mr. Kennedy\non the ground that he \u201cfailed to supervise student- athletes after\ngames.\u201d App. 114. But, in fact, this was a bespoke requirement\nspecifically addressed to Mr. Kennedy\u2019s religious exercise. The\nDistrict permitted other members of the coaching staff to forgo\nsupervising students briefly after the game to do things like visit\nwith friends or take personal phone calls. App. 205; see also Part\nI\u2013B,supra. Thus, any sort of postgame supervisory\nrequirement was not applied in an evenhanded, across-the-board way.\nAgain recognizing as much, the District conceded before the Ninth\nCircuit that its challenged directives were not \u201cgenerally\napplicable.\u201d 991 F.\u00a03d, at 1020.BWhen it comes to Mr. Kennedy\u2019s free speech\nclaim, our precedents remind us that the First Amendment\u2019s\nprotections extend to \u201cteachers and students,\u201d neither of whom\n\u201cshed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or\nexpression at the schoolhouse gate.\u201dTinkerv.Des Moines\nIndependent Community School Dist.,393\nU.S. 503, 506 (1969); see alsoLanev.Franks,573 U.S.\n228, 231 (2014). Of course, none of this means the speech\nrights of public school employees are so boundless that they may\ndeliver any message to anyone anytime they wish. In addition to\nbeing private citizens, teachers and coaches are also government\nemployees paid in part to speak on the government\u2019s behalf and\nconvey its intended messages.To account for the complexity associated with\nthe interplay between free speech rights and government employment,\nthis Court\u2019s decisions inPickeringv.Board of Ed. of\nTownship High School Dist. 205,Will Cty.,391 U.S.\n563(1968),Garcetti,547 U.S.\n410, and related cases suggest proceeding in two steps. The\nfirst step involves a threshold inquiry into the nature of the\nspeech at issue. If a public employee speaks \u201cpursuant to [his or\nher] official duties,\u201d this Court has said the Free Speech Clause\ngenerally will not shield the individual from an employer\u2019s control\nand discipline because that kind of speech is\u2014for constitutional\npurposes at least\u2014the government\u2019s own speech.Id., at\n421.At the same time and at the other end of the\nspectrum, when an employee \u201cspeaks as a citizen addressing a matter\nof public concern,\u201d our cases indicate that the First Amendment may\nbe implicated and courts should proceed to a second step.Id., at 423. At this second step, our cases suggest that\ncourts should attempt to engage in \u201ca delicate balancing of the\ncompeting interests surrounding the speech and its consequences.\u201dIbid. Among other things, courts at this second step have\nsometimes considered whether an employee\u2019s speech interests are\noutweighed by \u201c\u00a0\u2018the interest of the State, as an employer, in\npromoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through\nits employees.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId., at 417 (quotingPickering, 391 U.\u00a0S., at 568).Both sides ask us to employ at least certain\naspects of thisPickering\u2013Garcettiframework to\nresolve Mr. Kennedy\u2019s free speech claim. They share additional\ncommon ground too. They agree that Mr. Kennedy\u2019s speech implicates\na matter of public concern. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 183; Brief\nfor Respondent 44. They also appear to accept, at least for\nargument\u2019s sake, that Mr. Kennedy\u2019s speech does not raise questions\nof academic freedom that may or may not involve \u201cadditional\u201d First\nAmendment \u201cinterests\u201d beyond those captured by this framework.Garcetti, 547 U.\u00a0S., at 425; see alsoKeyishianv.Board of Regents of Univ. of State of N.\u00a0Y.,385 U.S.\n589, 603 (1967); Brief for Petitioner 26, n. 2. At the first\nstep of thePickering\u2013Garcettiinquiry, the parties\u2019\ndisagreement thus turns out to center on one question alone: Did\nMr. Kennedy offer his prayers in his capacity as a private citizen,\nor did they amount to government speech attributable to the\nDistrict?Our cases offer some helpful guidance for\nresolving this question. InGarcetti, the Court concluded\nthat a prosecutor\u2019s internal memorandum to a supervisor was made\n\u201cpursuant to [his] official duties,\u201d and thus ineligible for First\nAmendment protection. 547 U.\u00a0S., at 421. In reaching this\nconclusion, the Court relied on the fact that the prosecutor\u2019s\nspeech \u201cfulfill[ed] a responsibility to advise his supervisor about\nhow best to proceed with a pending case.\u201dIbid.In other\nwords, the prosecutor\u2019s memorandum was government speech because it\nwas speech the government \u201citself ha[d] commissioned or created\u201d\nand speech the employee was expected to deliver in the course of\ncarrying out his job.Id., at 422.By contrast, inLanea public employer\nsought to terminate an employee after he testified at a criminal\ntrial about matters involving his government employment. 573\nU.\u00a0S., at 233. The Court held that the employee\u2019s speech was\nprotected by the First Amendment.Id., at 231. In doing so,\nthe Court held that the fact the speech touched on matters related\nto public employment was not enough to render it government speech.Id., at 239\u2013240. Instead, the Court explained, the \u201ccritical\nquestion .\u00a0.\u00a0. is whether the speech at issue is itself\nordinarily within the scope of an employee\u2019s duties.\u201dId.,\nat 240. It is an inquiry this Court has said should be undertaken\n\u201cpractical[ly],\u201d rather than with a blinkered focus on the terms of\nsome formal and capacious written job description.Garcetti,\n547 U.\u00a0S., at 424. To proceed otherwise would be to allow\npublic employers to use \u201cexcessively broad job descriptions\u201d to\nsubvert the Constitution\u2019s protections.Ibid.Applying these lessons here, it seems clear to\nus that Mr. Kennedy has demonstrated that his speech was private\nspeech, not government speech. When Mr. Kennedy uttered the three\nprayers that resulted in his suspension, he was not engaged in\nspeech \u201cordinarily within the scope\u201d of his duties as a coach.Lane, 573 U.\u00a0S., at 240. He did not speak pursuant to\ngovernment policy. He was not seeking to convey a\ngovernment-created message. He was not instructing players,\ndiscussing strategy, encouraging better on-field performance, or\nengaged in any other speech the District paid him to produce as a\ncoach. See Part I\u2013B,supra. Simply put: Mr. Kennedy\u2019s\nprayers did not \u201cow[e their] existence\u201d to Mr. Kennedy\u2019s\nresponsibilities as a public employee.Garcetti, 547\nU.\u00a0S., at 421.The timing and circumstances of Mr. Kennedy\u2019s\nprayers confirm the point. During the postgame period when these\nprayers occurred, coaches were free to attend briefly to personal\nmatters\u2014everything from checking sports scores on their phones to\ngreeting friends and family in the stands. App. 205; see Part I\u2013B,supra. We find it unlikely that Mr. Kennedy was fulfilling a\nresponsibility imposed by his employment by praying during a period\nin which the District has acknowledged that its coaching staff was\nfree to engage in all manner of private speech. That Mr. Kennedy\noffered his prayers when students were engaged in other activities\nlike singing the school fight song further suggests that those\nprayers were not delivered as an address to the team, but instead\nin his capacity as a private citizen. Nor is it dispositive that\nMr. Kennedy\u2019s prayers took place \u201cwithin the office\u201d\nenvironment\u2014here, on the field of play.Garcetti, 547\nU.\u00a0S., at 421. Instead, what matters is whether Mr. Kennedy\noffered his prayers while acting within the scope of his duties as\na coach. And taken together, both the substance of Mr. Kennedy\u2019s\nspeech and the circumstances surrounding it point to the conclusion\nthat he did not.In reaching its contrary conclusion, the Ninth\nCircuit stressed that, as a coach, Mr. Kennedy served as a role\nmodel \u201cclothed with the mantle of one who imparts knowledge and\nwisdom.\u201d 991 F. 3d, at 1015. The court emphasized that Mr. Kennedy\nremained on duty after games.Id., at 1016. Before us, the\nDistrict presses the same arguments. See Brief for Respondent 24.\nAnd no doubt they have a point. Teachers and coaches often serve as\nvital role models. But this argument commits the error of positing\nan \u201cexcessively broad job descriptio[n]\u201d by treating everything\nteachers and coaches say in the workplace as government speech\nsubject to government control.Garcetti, 547 U.\u00a0S., at\n424. On this understanding, a school could fire a Muslim teacher\nfor wearing a headscarf in the classroom or prohibit a Christian\naide from praying quietly over her lunch in the cafeteria.\nLikewise, this argument ignores the District Court\u2019s conclusion\n(and the District\u2019s concession) that Mr. Kennedy\u2019s actual job\ndescription left time for a private moment after the game to call\nhome, check a text, socialize, or engage in any manner of secular\nactivities. Others working for the District were free to engage\nbriefly in personal speech and activity. App. 205; see Part I\u2013B,supra. That Mr. Kennedy chose to use the same time to pray\ndoes not transform his speech into government speech. To hold\ndifferently would be to treat religious expression as second-class\nspeech and eviscerate this Court\u2019s repeated promise that teachers\ndo not \u201cshed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or\nexpression at the schoolhouse gate.\u201dTinker, 393 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 506.Of course, acknowledging that Mr. Kennedy\u2019s\nprayers represented his own private speech does not end the matter.\nSo far, we have recognized only that Mr. Kennedy has carried his\nthreshold burden. Under thePickering\u2013Garcettiframework, a second step remains where the government may seek to\nprove that its interests as employer outweigh even an employee\u2019s\nprivate speech on a matter of public concern. SeeLane, 573\nU.\u00a0S., at 236, 242.[2]IVWhether one views the case through the lens of\nthe Free Exercise or Free Speech Clause, at this point the burden\nshifts to the District. Under the Free Exercise Clause, a\ngovernment entity normally must satisfy at least \u201cstrict scrutiny,\u201d\nshowing that its restrictions on the plaintiff\u00a0\u2019s protected\nrights serve a compelling interest and are narrowly tailored to\nthat end. SeeLukumi, 508 U.\u00a0S., at 533; n.\u00a01,supra. A similar standard generally obtains under the Free\nSpeech Clause. SeeReed, 576 U.\u00a0S., at 171. The\nDistrict, however, asks us to apply to Mr. Kennedy\u2019s claims the\nmore lenient second-stepPickering\u2013Garcettitest, or\nalternatively intermediate scrutiny. See Brief for Respondent\n44\u201348. Ultimately, however, it does not matter which standard we\napply. The District cannot sustain its burden under any of\nthem.[3]AAs we have seen, the District argues that its\nsuspension of Mr. Kennedy was essential to avoid a violation of the\nEstablishment Clause.Id., at 35\u201342. On its account, Mr.\nKennedy\u2019s prayers might have been protected by the Free Exercise\nand Free Speech Clauses. But his rights were in \u201cdirect tension\u201d\nwith the competing demands of the Establishment Clause. App. 43. To\nresolve that clash, the District reasoned, Mr. Kennedy\u2019s rights had\nto \u201cyield.\u201dIbid. The Ninth Circuit pursued this same line\nof thinking, insisting that the District\u2019s interest in avoiding an\nEstablishment Clause violation \u201c\u00a0\u2018trump[ed]\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr.\nKennedy\u2019s rights to religious exercise and free speech. 991\nF.\u00a03d, at 1017; see alsoid., at 1020\u20131021.But how could that be? It is true that this\nCourt and others often refer to the \u201cEstablishment Clause,\u201d the\n\u201cFree Exercise Clause,\u201d and the \u201cFree Speech Clause\u201d as separate\nunits. But the three Clauses appear in the same sentence of the\nsame Amendment: \u201cCongress shall make no law respecting an\nestablishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise\nthereof; or abridging the freedom of speech.\u201d Amdt. 1. A natural\nreading of that sentence would seem to suggest the Clauses have\n\u201ccomplementary\u201d purposes, not warring ones where one Clause is\nalways sure to prevail over the others. SeeEversonv.Board of Ed. of Ewing,330 U.S.\n1, 13, 15 (1947).The District arrived at a different\nunderstanding this way. It began with the premise that the\nEstablishment Clause is offended whenever a \u201creasonable observer\u201d\ncould conclude that the government has \u201cendorse[d]\u201d religion. App.\n81. The District then took the view that a \u201creasonable observer\u201d\ncould think it \u201cendorsed Kennedy\u2019s religious activity by not\nstopping the practice.\u201d 991 F.\u00a03d, at 1018; see also App.\n80\u201381; Parts I and II,supra. On the District\u2019s account, it\ndid not matter whether the Free Exercise Clause protected Mr.\nKennedy\u2019s prayer. It did not matter if his expression was private\nspeech protected by the Free Speech Clause. It did not matter that\nthe District never actually endorsed Mr. Kennedy\u2019s prayer, no one\ncomplained that it had, and a strong public reaction only followed\nafter the District sought to ban Mr. Kennedy\u2019s prayer. Because a\nreasonable observer could (mistakenly) infer that by allowing the\nprayer the District endorsed Mr. Kennedy\u2019s message, the District\nfelt it had to act, even if that meant suppressing otherwise\nprotected First Amendment activities. In this way, the District\neffectively created its own \u201cvise between the Establishment Clause\non one side and the Free Speech and Free Exercise Clauses on the\nother,\u201d placed itself in the middle, and then chose its preferred\nway out of its self-imposed trap. SeePinette, 515\nU.\u00a0S., at 768 (plurality opinion);Shurtleffv.Boston, 596 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___\u2013___ (2022) (Gorsuch, J.,\nconcurring in judgment) (slip op., at 4\u20135).To defend its approach, the District relied onLemonand its progeny. See App. 43\u201345. In upholding the\nDistrict\u2019s actions, the Ninth Circuit followed the same course. See\nPart II\u2013C,supra. And, to be sure, inLemonthis\nCourt attempted a \u201cgrand unified theory\u201d for assessing\nEstablishment Clause claims.American Legionv.American\nHumanist Assn., 588 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2019) (plurality\nopinion) (slip op., at 24). That approach called for an examination\nof a law\u2019s purposes, effects, and potential for entanglement with\nreligion.Lemon, 403 U.\u00a0S., at 612\u2013613. In time, the\napproach also came to involve estimations about whether a\n\u201creasonable observer\u201d would consider the government\u2019s challenged\naction an \u201cendorsement\u201d of religion. See,e.g.,County of\nAlleghenyv.American Civil Liberties Union,Greater\nPittsburgh Chapter,492 U.S.\n573, 593 (1989);id., at 630 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring\nin part and concurring in judgment);Shurtleff, 596\nU.\u00a0S., at ___ (opinion of Gorsuch, J.) (slip op., at 3).What the District and the Ninth Circuit\noverlooked, however, is that the \u201cshortcomings\u201d associated with\nthis \u201cambitiou[s],\u201d abstract, and ahistorical approach to the\nEstablishment Clause became so \u201capparent\u201d that this Court long ago\nabandonedLemonand its endorsement test offshoot.American Legion, 588 U.\u00a0S., at ___\u2013___ (plurality\nopinion) (slip op., at 12\u201313); see alsoTown of Greecev.Galloway,572\nU.S. 565, 575\u2013577 (2014). The Court has explained that these\ntests \u201cinvited chaos\u201d in lower courts, led to \u201cdiffering results\u201d\nin materially identical cases, and created a \u201cminefield\u201d for\nlegislators.Pinette, 515 U.\u00a0S., at 768\u2013769, n.\u00a03\n(plurality opinion) (emphasis deleted). This Court has since made\nplain, too, that the Establishment Clause does not include anything\nlike a \u201cmodified heckler\u2019s veto, in which .\u00a0.\u00a0. religious\nactivity can be proscribed\u201d based on \u201c\u00a0\u2018perceptions\u2019\u00a0\u201d or\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018discomfort.\u2019\u00a0\u201dGood News Clubv.Milford\nCentral School,533 U.S.\n98, 119 (2001) (emphasis deleted). An Establishment Clause\nviolation does not automatically follow whenever a public school or\nother government entity \u201cfail[s] to censor\u201d private religious\nspeech.Board of Ed. of Westside Community Schools (Dist.\n66)v.Mergens,496 U.S.\n226, 250 (1990) (plurality opinion). Nor does the Clause\n\u201ccompel the government to purge from the public sphere\u201d anything an\nobjective observer could reasonably infer endorses or \u201cpartakes of\nthe religious.\u201dVan Ordenv.Perry,545\nU.S. 677, 699 (2005) (Breyer, J., concurring in judgment). In\nfact, just this Term the Court unanimously rejected a city\u2019s\nattempt to censor religious speech based onLemonand the\nendorsement test. SeeShurtleff, 596 U.\u00a0S., at ___\u2013___\n(slip op., at 1\u20132);id., at ___ (Alito, J., concurring in\njudgment) (slip op., at 1);id., at ___, ___\u2013___ (opinion of\nGorsuch, J.)

An analysis focused\non original meaning and history, this Court has stressed, has long\nrepresented the rule rather than some \u201c\u00a0\u2018exception\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nwithin the \u201cCourt\u2019s Establishment Clause jurisprudence.\u201d 572\nU.\u00a0S., at 575; seeAmerican Legion, 588 U.\u00a0S., at\n___ (plurality opinion) (slip op., at 25);Torcasov.Watkins,367 U.S.\n488, 490 (1961) (analyzing certain historical elements of\nreligious establishments);McGowanv.Maryland,366 U.S.\n420, 437\u2013440 (1961) (analyzing Sunday closing laws by looking\nto their \u201cplace .\u00a0.\u00a0. in the First Amendment\u2019s history\u201d);Walzv.Tax Comm\u2019n of City of New York,397 U.S.\n664, 680 (1970) (analyzing the \u201chistory and uninterrupted\npractice\u201d of church tax exemptions). The District and the Ninth\nCircuit erred by failing to heed this guidance.BPerhaps sensing that the primary theory it\npursued below rests on a mistaken understanding of the\nEstablishment Clause, the District offers a backup argument in this\nCourt. It still contends that its Establishment Clause concerns\ntrump Mr. Kennedy\u2019s free exercise and free speech rights. But the\nDistrict now seeks to supply different reasoning for that result.\nNow, it says, it was justified in suppressing Mr. Kennedy\u2019s\nreligious activity because otherwise it would have been guilty of\ncoercing students to pray. See Brief for Respondent 34\u201337. And, the\nDistrict says, coercing worship amounts to an Establishment Clause\nviolation on anyone\u2019s account of the Clause\u2019s original meaning.As it turns out, however, there is a pretty\nobvious reason why the Ninth Circuit did not adopt this theory in\nproceedings below: The evidence cannot sustain it. To be sure, this\nCourt has long held that government may not, consistent with a\nhistorically sensitive understanding of the Establishment Clause,\n\u201cmake a religious observance compulsory.\u201dZorachv.Clauson,343 U.S.\n306, 314 (1952). Government \u201cmay not coerce anyone to attend\nchurch,\u201dibid., nor may it force citizens to engage in \u201ca\nformal religious exercise,\u201dLeev.Weisman,505\nU.S. 577, 589 (1992). No doubt, too, coercion along these lines\nwas among the foremost hallmarks of religious establishments the\nframers sought to prohibit when they adopted the First\nAmendment.[5] Members of this\nCourt have sometimes disagreed on what exactly qualifies as\nimpermissible coercion in light of the original meaning of the\nEstablishment Clause. CompareLee, 505 U.\u00a0S., at 593,\nwithid., at 640\u2013641 (Scalia, J., dissenting). But in this\ncase Mr. Kennedy\u2019s private religious exercise did not come close to\ncrossing any line one might imagine separating protected private\nexpression from impermissible government coercion.Begin with the District\u2019s own contemporaneous\ndescription of the facts. In its correspondence with Mr. Kennedy,\nthe District never raised coercion concerns. To the contrary, the\nDistrict conceded in a public 2015 document that there was \u201cno\nevidence that students [were] directly coerced to pray with\nKennedy.\u201d App. 105. This is consistent with Mr. Kennedy\u2019s account\ntoo. He has repeatedly stated that he \u201cnever coerced, required, or\nasked any student to pray,\u201d and that he never \u201ctold any student\nthat it was important that they participate in any religious\nactivity.\u201dId., at 170.Consider, too, the actual requests Mr. Kennedy\nmade. The District did not discipline Mr. Kennedy for engaging in\nprayer while presenting locker-room speeches to students. That\ntradition predated Mr. Kennedy at the school. App. 170. And he\nwillingly ended it, as the District has acknowledged.Id.,\nat 77, 170.He also willingly ended his practice of postgame\nreligious talks with his team.Id., at 70, 77, 170\u2013172. The\nonly prayer Mr. Kennedy sought to continue was the kind he had\n\u201cstarted out doing\u201d at the beginning of his tenure\u2014the prayer he\ngave alone.Id., at 293\u2013294. He made clear that he could\npray \u201cwhile the kids were doing the fight song\u201d and \u201ctake a knee by\n[him]self and give thanks and continue on.\u201dId., at 294. Mr.\nKennedy even considered it \u201cacceptable\u201d to say his \u201cprayer while\nthe players were walking to the locker room\u201d or \u201cbus,\u201d and then\ncatch up with his team.Id., at 280, 282; see alsoid., at 59 (proposing the team leave the field for the\nprayer). In short, Mr. Kennedy did not seek to direct any prayers\nto students or require anyone else to participate. His plan was to\nwait to pray until athletes were occupied, and he \u201ctold everybody\u201d\nthat\u2019s what he wished \u201cto do.\u201dId., at 292. It was for three\nprayers of this sort alone in October 2015 that the District\nsuspended him. See Parts I\u2013B and I\u2013C,supra.Naturally, Mr. Kennedy\u2019s proposal to pray\nquietly by himself on the field would have meant some people would\nhave seen his religious exercise. Those close at hand might have\nheard him too. But learning how to tolerate speech or prayer of all\nkinds is \u201cpart of learning how to live in a pluralistic society,\u201d a\ntrait of character essential to \u201ca tolerant citizenry.\u201dLee,\n505 U.\u00a0S., at 590. This Court has long recognized as well that\n\u201csecondary school students are mature enough .\u00a0.\u00a0. to\nunderstand that a school does not endorse,\u201d let alone coerce them\nto participate in, \u201cspeech that it merely permits on a\nnondiscriminatory basis.\u201dMergens, 496 U.\u00a0S., at 250\n(plurality opinion). Of course, some will take offense to certain\nforms of speech or prayer they are sure to encounter in a society\nwhere those activities enjoy such robust constitutional protection.\nBut \u201c[o]ffense\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. does not equate to coercion.\u201dTown of Greece, 572 U.\u00a0S., at 589 (plurality\nopinion).The District responds that, as a coach, Mr.\nKennedy \u201cwielded enormous authority and influence over the\nstudents,\u201d and students might have felt compelled to pray alongside\nhim. Brief for Respondent 37. To support this argument, the\nDistrict submits that, after Mr. Kennedy\u2019s suspension, a few\nparents told District employees that their sons had \u201cparticipated\nin the team prayers only because they did not wish to separate\nthemselves from the team.\u201d App. 356.This reply fails too. Not only does the District\nrely on hearsay to advance it. For all we can tell, the concerns\nthe District says it heard from parents were occasioned by the\nlocker-room prayers that predated Mr. Kennedy\u2019s tenure or his\npostgame religious talks, all of which he discontinued at the\nDistrict\u2019s request. There is no indication in the record that\nanyone expressed any coercion concerns to the District about the\nquiet, postgame prayers that Mr. Kennedy asked to continue and that\nled to his suspension. Nor is there any record evidence that\nstudents felt pressured to participate in these prayers. To the\ncontrary, and as we have seen, not a single Bremerton student\njoined Mr. Kennedy\u2019s quiet prayers following the three October 2015\ngames for which he was disciplined. On October 16, those students\nwho joined Mr. Kennedy were \u201c\u00a0\u2018from the opposing team,\u2019\u00a0\u201d\n991 F.\u00a03d, at 1012\u20131013, and thus could not have \u201creasonably\nfear[ed]\u201d that he would decrease their \u201cplaying time\u201d or destroy\ntheir \u201copportunities\u201d if they did not \u201cparticipate,\u201d Brief for\nRespondent 43. As for the other two relevant games, \u201cno one joined\u201d\nMr. Kennedy on October 23. 991 F.\u00a03d, at 1019. And only a few\nmembers of the public participated on October 26. App. 97, 314\u2013315;\nsee also Part I\u2013B,supra.[6]The absence of evidence of coercion in this\nrecord leaves the District to its final redoubt. Here, the District\nsuggests thatanyvisible religious conduct by a teacher or\ncoach should be deemed\u2014without more and as a matter of\nlaw\u2014impermissibly coercive on students. In essence, the District\nasks us to adopt the view that the only acceptable government role\nmodels for students are those who eschew any visible religious\nexpression. See alsopost, at 16\u201317 (Sotomayor,\u00a0J.,\ndissenting). If the argument sounds familiar, it should. Really, it\nis just another way of repackaging the District\u2019s earlier\nsubmission that government may script everything a teacher or coach\nsays in the workplace. See Part III\u2013B,supra. The only added\ntwist here is the District\u2019s suggestion not only that itmayprohibit teachers from engaging in any demonstrative religious\nactivity, but that itmustdo so in order to conform to the\nConstitution.Such a rule would be a sure sign that our\nEstablishment Clause jurisprudence had gone off the rails. In the\nname of protecting religious liberty, the District would have us\nsuppress it. Rather than respect the First Amendment\u2019s double\nprotection for religious expression, it would have us preference\nsecular activity. Not only could schools fire teachers for praying\nquietly over their lunch, for wearing a yarmulke to school, or for\noffering a midday prayer during a break before practice. Under the\nDistrict\u2019s rule, a school would berequiredto do so. It is\na rule that would defy this Court\u2019s traditional understanding that\npermitting private speech is not the same thing as coercing others\nto participate in it. SeeTown of Greece, 572 U.\u00a0S., at\n589 (plurality opinion). It is a rule, too, that would undermine a\nlong constitutional tradition under which learning how to tolerate\ndiverse expressive activities has always been \u201cpart of learning how\nto live in a pluralistic society.\u201dLee, 505 U.\u00a0S., at\n590. We are aware of no historically sound understanding of the\nEstablishment Clause that begins to \u201cmak[e] it necessary for\ngovernment to be hostile to religion\u201d in this way.Zorach,\n343 U.\u00a0S., at 314.Our judgments on all these scores find support\nin this Court\u2019s prior cases too. InZorach, for example,\nchallengers argued that a public school program permitting students\nto spend time in private religious instruction off campus was\nimpermissibly coercive.Id., at 308, 311\u2013312. The Court\nrejected that challenge because students were not required to\nattend religious instruction and there was no evidence that any\nemployee had \u201cus[ed] their office to persuade or force students\u201d to\nparticipate in religious activity.Id., at 311, and\nn.\u00a06. What was clear there is even more obvious here\u2014where\nthere is no evidence anyone sought to persuade or force students to\nparticipate, and there is no formal school program accommodating\nthe religious activity at issue.Meanwhile, this case looks very different from\nthose in which this Court has found prayer involving public school\nstudents to be problematically coercive. InLee, this Court\nheld that school officials violated the Establishment Clause by\n\u201cincluding [a] clerical membe[r]\u201d who publicly recited prayers \u201cas\npart of [an] official school graduation ceremony\u201d because the\nschool had \u201cin every practical sense compelled attendance and\nparticipation in\u201d a \u201creligious exercise.\u201d 505 U.\u00a0S., at 580,\n598. InSanta Fe Independent School Dist.v.Doe, the\nCourt held that a school district violated the Establishment Clause\nby broadcasting a prayer \u201cover the public address system\u201d before\neach football game.530 U.S.\n290, 294 (2000). The Court observed that, while students\ngenerally were not required to attend games, attendancewasrequired for \u201ccheerleaders, members of the band, and, of course,\nthe team members themselves.\u201dId., at 311. None of that is\ntrue here. The prayers for which Mr. Kennedy was disciplined were\nnot publicly broadcast or recited to a captive audience. Students\nwere not required or expected to participate. And, in fact, none of\nMr. Kennedy\u2019s students did participate in any of the three October\n2015 prayers that resulted in Mr. Kennedy\u2019s discipline. See App.\n90, 97, 173, 236\u2013239; Parts I\u2013B and I\u2013C,supra.[7]CIn the end, the District\u2019s case hinges on the\nneed to generate conflict between an individual\u2019s rights under the\nFree Exercise and Free Speech Clauses and its own Establishment\nClause duties\u2014and then develop some explanation why one of these\nClauses in the First Amendment should \u201c\u00a0\u2018trum[p]\u2019\u00a0\u201d the\nother two. 991 F.\u00a03d, at 1017; App. 43. But the project\nfalters badly. Not only does the District fail to offer a sound\nreason to prefer one constitutional guarantee over another. It\ncannot even show that they are at odds. In truth, there is no\nconflict between the constitutional commands before us. There is\nonly the \u201cmere shadow\u201d of a conflict, a false choice premised on a\nmisconstruction of the Establishment Clause.Schempp, 374\nU.\u00a0S., at 308 (Goldberg, J., concurring). And in no world may\na government entity\u2019s concerns about phantom constitutional\nviolations justify actual violations of an individual\u2019s First\nAmendment rights. See,e.g.,Rosenberger, 515\nU.\u00a0S., at 845\u2013846;Good News Club, 533 U.\u00a0S., at\n112\u2013119;Lamb\u2019s Chapelv.Center Moriches Union Free\nSchool Dist.,508 U.S.\n384, 394\u2013395 (1993);Widmar, 454 U.\u00a0S., at\n270\u2013275.[8]VRespect for religious expressions is\nindispensable to life in a free and diverse Republic\u2014whether those\nexpressions take place in a sanctuary or on a field, and whether\nthey manifest through the spoken word or a bowed head. Here, a\ngovernment entity sought to punish an individual for engaging in a\nbrief, quiet, personal religious observance doubly protected by the\nFree Exercise and Free Speech Clauses of the First Amendment. And\nthe only meaningful justification the government offered for its\nreprisal rested on a mistaken view that it had a duty to ferret out\nand suppress religious observances even as it allows comparable\nsecular speech. The Constitution neither mandates nor tolerates\nthat kind of discrimination. Mr. Kennedy is entitled to summary\njudgment on his First Amendment claims. The judgment of the Court\nof Appeals isReversed.Notes1A plaintiff may also\nprove a free exercise violation by showing that \u201cofficial\nexpressions of hostility\u201d to religion accompany laws or policies\nburdening religious exercise; in cases like that we have \u201cset\naside\u201d such policies without further inquiry.Masterpiece\nCakeshop,Ltd.v.Colorado Civil Rights Comm\u2019n,\n584 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2018) (slip op., at 18). To resolve\ntoday\u2019s case, however, we have no need to consult that test.\nLikewise, while the test we do apply today has been the subject of\nsome criticism, see,e.g.,Fultonv.Philadelphia, 593\u00a0U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2021) (slip op.,\nat 5), we have no need to engage with that debate today because no\nparty has asked us to do so.2Because our analysis and\nthe parties\u2019 concessions lead to the conclusion that Mr. Kennedy\u2019s\nprayer constituted private speech on a matter of public concern, we\ndo not decide whether the Free Exercise Clause may sometimes demand\na different analysis at the first step of thePickering\u2013Garcettiframework.3It seems, too, that it is\nonly here where our disagreement with the dissent begins in\nearnest. We do not understand our colleagues to contest that Mr.\nKennedy has met his burdens under either the Free Exercise or Free\nSpeech Clause, but only to suggest the District has carried its own\nburden \u201cto establish that its policy prohibiting Kennedy\u2019s public\nprayers was the least restrictive means of furthering a compelling\nstate interest.\u201dPost, at 22 (opinion of\nSotomayor,\u00a0J.).4Nor was that decision an\noutlier.

But that\nconcern supplies no excuse to adorn the Constitution with rules not\nsupported by its terms and the traditions undergirding them. Nor,\nin any event, is there any question that the District understands\nthat coercion can be a hallmark of an Establishment Clause\nviolation. See App. 105. The District\u2019s problem isn\u2019t a failure to\nidentify coercion as a crucial legal consideration; it is a lack of\nevidence that coercion actually occurred.7Even if the personal\nprayers Mr. Kennedy sought to offer after games are not themselves\ncoercive, the dissent suggests that they bear an indelible taint of\ncoercion by association with the school\u2019s past prayer\npractices\u2014some of which predated Mr. Kennedy, and all of which the\nDistrict concedes he ended on request. But none of those abandoned\npractices formed the basis for Mr. Kennedy\u2019s suspension, and he has\nnot sought to claim First Amendment protection for them. SeeTown of Greece, 572 U.\u00a0S., at 585 (other past practices\ndo not permanently \u201cdespoil a practice\u201d later challenged under the\nEstablishment Clause). Nor, contrary to the dissent, does the\npossibility that students might choose, unprompted, to participate\nin Mr. Kennedy\u2019s prayers necessarily prove them coercive. Seepost, at 18\u201320, 32\u201333. For one thing, the District has\nconceded that no coach may \u201cdiscourag[e]\u201d voluntary student prayer\nunder its policies. Tr. of Oral Arg. 91. For another, Mr. Kennedy\nhas repeatedly explained that he is willing to conduct his prayer\nwithout students\u2014as he did after each of the games that formed the\nbasis of his suspension\u2014and after students head to the locker room\nor bus. See App. 280, 282, 292\u2013294.8Failing under its\ncoercion theory, the District offers still another backup argument.\nIt contends that it had to suppress Mr. Kennedy\u2019s protected First\nAmendment activity to ensure order at Bremerton football games. See\nalsopost, at 2, 8\u20139, 11, 34\u201335 (Sotomayor,\u00a0J.,\ndissenting). But the District never raised concerns along these\nlines in its contemporaneous correspondence with Mr. Kennedy. And\nunsurprisingly, neither the District Court nor the Ninth Circuit\ninvoked this rationale to justify the District\u2019s actions.\nGovernment \u201cjustification[s]\u201d for interfering with First Amendment\nrights \u201cmust be genuine, not hypothesized or inventedpost\nhocin response to litigation.\u201dUnited Statesv.Virginia,518 U.S.\n515, 533 (1996).
