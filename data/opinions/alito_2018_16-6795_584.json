Petitioner moved\nfor funding under 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73599(f\u00a0), which makes\nfunds available if they are \u201creasonably necessary,\u201d but\npetitioner\u2019s motion was denied. We hold that the lower courts\napplied the wrong legal standard, and we therefore vacate the\njudgment below and remand for further proceedings.IAIn 1997, petitioner was convicted of capital\nmurder in a Texas court. Evidence at trial showed that he and two\naccomplices invaded the home of a 67-year-old Houston woman,\nSantiaga Paneque, bound her with duct tape and electrical cord,\nbeat and strangled her, and then made off with a stash of her\nbelongings.The jury also heard testimony from Henry Nuila\nregarding an incident that occurred about two weeks after the\nmurder. Petitioner was drunk at the time, and he revealed to Nuila\nthat he had recently murdered a woman in Houston. Petitioner then\nbrandished an Uzi machinegun and threatened to murder Nuila if he\ndid not help petitioner kill his two accomplices. Fortunately for\nNuila, petitioner kept talking until he eventually passed out;\nNuila then called the police, who arrested petitioner, still in\npossession of the gun.After the jury found petitioner guilty, it was\nasked to determine whether he should be sentenced to death or to\nlife in prison. In order to impose a death sentence, Texas law\nrequired the jury to answer the following three questions. First,\nwould petitioner pose a continuing threat to society? Second, had\nhe personally caused the death of the victim, intended to kill her,\nor anticipated that she would be killed? Third, in light of all the\nevidence surrounding the crime and petitioner\u2019s background, were\nthere sufficient mitigating circumstances to warrant a sentence of\nlife without parole instead of death? Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann.,\nArt. 37.071, \u00a7\u00a72(b), (e) (Vernon Cum. Supp. 2017). Only if the jury\ngave a unanimous yes to the first two questions, and a unanimous no\nto the third question, could a death sentence be imposed;\notherwise, petitioner would receive a sentence of life without\nparole. See \u00a7\u00a72(d)(2), (f\u00a0)(2), (g).In asking the jury to impose a death sentence,\nthe prosecution supplemented the trial record with evidence of\npetitioner\u2019s criminal record and his encounter with a man named\nCandelario Martinez a few days after the murder. Martinez told the\njury that he was standing in a hotel parking lot waiting for a\nfriend when petitioner approached and began to make small talk.\nBefore long, petitioner pulled out a machinegun and forced Martinez\ninto a room where two of petitioner\u2019s compatriots were holding\nMartinez\u2019s friend at knifepoint. Ordered to lie down on the\nbathroom floor and await his execution, Martinez begged for his\nlife while petitioner and his cohorts haggled about who would carry\nout the killing. Finally, petitioner relented, but he threatened to\nkill Martinez and his family if he contacted the police. Petitioner\nthen stole Martinez\u2019s truck.Petitioner\u2019s trial counsel presented very little\nmitigation evidence. This was due, at least in part, to\npetitioner\u2019s steadfast refusal for many months to allow his lawyers\nto contact his family members, who were living in Honduras and\nmight have testified about his character and upbringing. Petitioner\ngave in on the eve of trial, and at that point, according to the\nstate habeas courts, his lawyers \u201cmade every effort to contact\n[his] family.\u201d App. 171. They repeatedly contacted petitioner\u2019s\nfamily members and urged them to attend the trial; they requested\nthat the U.\u00a0S. Embassy in Honduras facilitate family members\u2019\ntravel to the United States; and they met in person with the\nHonduran Consulate to seek assistance. But these efforts were to no\navail. Petitioner\u2019s sister told his legal team that the family\nwould not leave Honduras because the journey would create economic\nhardship and because their father was ill and had killed one of\ntheir neighbors. A defense attorney who spoke to petitioner\u2019s\nmother testified that she seemed unconcerned about her son\u2019s\nsituation. In general, the state habeas courts found, petitioner\n\u201cdid nothing to assist counsel\u2019s efforts to contact his family and\ndid not want them contacted by the consulate or counsel.\u201dId.,at 174.In the end, the only mitigation evidence\nintroduced by petitioner\u2019s trial counsel consisted of three letters\nfrom petitioner\u2019s English instructor. The letters, each two\nsentences long, described petitioner as \u201ca serious and attentive\nstudent who is progressing well in English.\u201dIbid.The jury unanimously concluded that petitioner\nshould be sentenced to death, and a capital sentence was imposed.\nPetitioner secured new counsel to handle his appeal, and his\nconviction and sentence were affirmed by the Texas Court of\nCriminal Appeals in 1998.Ayestasv.State, No.\n72,928, App. 115. Petitioner did not seek review at that time from\nthis Court.BWhile petitioner\u2019s direct appeal was still\npending, a third legal team filed a habeas petition on his behalf\nin state court. This petition included several claims of\ntrial-level ineffective assistance of counsel, but the petition did\nnot assert that trial counsel were ineffective for failing to\ninvestigate petitioner\u2019s mental health and abuse of alcohol and\ndrugs. Petitioner\u2019s quest for state habeas relief ended\nunsuccessfully in 2008.Ex\u00a0parteAyestas, No.\nWR\u201369,674\u201301 (Tex. Ct. Crim. App., Sept. 10, 2008), 2008 WL 4151814\n(per curiam) (unpublished).In 2009, represented by a fourth set of\nattorneys, petitioner filed a federal habeas petition under 28\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72254, and this time hedidallege that\nhis right to the effective assistance of counsel at trial was\nviolated because his attorneys failed to conduct an adequate search\nfor mitigation evidence. As relevant here, petitioner argued that\ntrial counsel overlooked evidence that he was mentally ill and had\na history of drug and alcohol abuse.Ayestasv.Thaler, Civ. Action No. H\u201309\u20132999 (SD Tex., Jan. 26, 2011),\n2011 WL 285138, *4. Petitioner alleged that he had a history of\nsubstance abuse, and he noted that he had been diagnosed with\nschizophrenia while the state habeas proceeding was still pending.\nSee Pet. for Writ of Habeas Corpus inAyestasv.Quarterman, No. 4:09\u2013cv\u20132999 (SD Tex.), Doc. 1, pp. 21\u201323.\nPetitioner claimed that trial counsel\u2019s deficient performance\ncaused prejudice because there was a reasonable chance that an\nadequate investigation would have produced mitigation evidence that\nwould have persuaded the jury to spare his life.Among the obstacles standing between petitioner\nand federal habeas relief, however, was the fact that he never\nraised this trial-level ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim in\nstate court. The District Court therefore held that the claim was\nbarred by procedural default,Ayestasv.Thaler, 2011\nWL 285138, *4\u2013*7, and the Fifth Circuit affirmed,Ayestasv.Thaler, 462 Fed. Appx. 474, 482 (2012) (per\ncuriam).Petitioner sought review in this Court, and we\nvacated the decision below and remanded for reconsideration in\nlight of two of our subsequent decisions,Martinezv.Ryan, 566 U.\u00a0S. 1 (2012) , andTrevinov.Thaler, 569 U.\u00a0S. 413 (2013) .Ayestasv.Thaler, 569 U.\u00a0S. 1015 (2013) .Martinezheld\nthat an Arizona prisoner seeking federal habeas relief could\novercome the procedural default of a trial-level\nineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim by showing that the claim\nis substantial and that state habeas counsel was also ineffective\nin failing to raise the claim in a state habeas proceeding. 566\nU.\u00a0S., at 14.Trevinoextended that holding to Texas\nprisoners, 569 U.\u00a0S., at 416\u2013417, and on remand, petitioner\nargued that he fell withinTrevinobecause effective state\nhabeas counsel would have uncovered evidence showing that trial\ncounsels\u2019 investigative efforts were deficient.To assist in developing these claims, petitioner\nfiled anex\u00a0partemotion asking the District Court for\n$20,016 in funding to conduct a search for evidence supporting his\npetition. He relied on 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73599(f\u00a0), which\nprovides in relevant part as follows:\u201cUpon a finding that investigative,\nexpert, or other services are reasonably necessary for the\nrepresentation of the defendant, whether in connection with issues\nrelating to guilt or the sentence, the court may authorize the\ndefendant\u2019s attorneys to obtain such services on behalf of the\ndefendant and, if so authorized, shall order the payment of fees\nand expenses therefor.\u201dPetitioner averred that the funds would be used\nto conduct an investigation that would show that his trial counsel\nand his state habeas counsel were ineffective. Accordingly, he\nclaimed, the investigation would establish both that his\ntrial-level ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim was not barred\nby procedural default and that he was entitled to resentencing\nbased on the denial of his Sixth Amendment right to the effective\nassistance of trial counsel.The District Court refused the funding request\nand ultimately denied petitioner\u2019s habeas petition.Ayestasv.Stephens, Civ. Action No. H\u201309\u20132999, (SD Tex., Nov. 18,\n2014), 2014 WL 6606498, *6\u2013*7. On the merits of petitioner\u2019s new\nineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim, the District Court\nheld that petitioner failed both prongs of theStricklandtest. SeeStricklandv.Washington, 466 U.\u00a0S.\n668 (1984) . Noting that most of the evidence bearing on\npetitioner\u2019s mental health had emerged only after he was sentenced,\nthe court concluded that petitioner\u2019s trial lawyers were not\ndeficient in failing to find such evidence in time for the\nsentencing proceeding. 2014 WL 6606498, *5. In addition, the court\nfound that state habeas counsel did not render deficient\nperformance by failing to investigate petitioner\u2019s history of\nsubstance abuse, and that, in any event, petitioner was not\nprejudiced at the sentencing phase of the trial or during the state\nhabeas proceedings because the potential mitigation evidence at\nissue would not have made a difference to the jury in light of \u201cthe\nextremely brutal nature of [the] crime and [petitioner\u2019s] history\nof criminal violence.\u201dIbid.With respect to funding, the District Court\npointed to Fifth Circuit case law holding that a \u00a73599(f\u00a0)\nfunding applicant cannot show that investigative services are\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018reasonably necessary\u2019\u00a0\u201d unless the applicant can show\nthat he has a \u201c\u00a0\u2018substantial need\u2019\u00a0\u201d for those services.Id.,at *6. In addition, the court noted that \u201c[t]he Fifth\nCircuit upholds the denial of funding\u201d when, among other things, \u201ca\npetitioner has .\u00a0.\u00a0. failed to supplement his funding\nrequest with a viable constitutional claim that is not procedurally\nbarred.\u201dIbid. (internal quotation marks omitted).Given its holding that petitioner\u2019s new\nineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim was precluded by procedural\ndefault, this rule also doomed his request for funding. The\nDistrict Court denied petitioner\u2019s habeas petition and refused to\ngrant him a certificate of appealability (COA).Id.,at *7.\nOn appeal, the Fifth Circuit held that a COA was not needed for\nreview of the funding issue, but it rejected that claim for\nessentially the same reasons as the District Court, citing both the\n\u201csubstantial need\u201d test and the rule that funding may be denied\nwhen a funding applicant fails to present \u201ca viable constitutional\nclaim that is not procedurally barred.\u201dAyestasv.Stephens, 817 F.\u00a03d 888, 895\u2013896 (2016) (internal\nquotation marks omitted). With respect to petitioner\u2019s other\nclaims, including his claim of ineffective assistance of trial\ncounsel, the Fifth Circuit refused to issue a COA.Id.,at\n898.CWe granted certiorari to decide whether the\nlower courts applied the correct legal standard in denying the\nfunding request. 581 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2017).IIBefore we reach that question, however, we\nmust consider a jurisdictional argument advanced by respondent, the\nDirector of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice.[1] Respondent contends that the District\nCourt\u2019s denial of petitioner\u2019s funding request was an\nadministrative, not a judicial, decision and therefore falls\noutside the scope of the jurisdictional provisions on which\npetitioner relied in seeking review in the Court of Appeals and in\nthis Court.AWhen the District Court denied petitioner\u2019s\nfunding request and his habeas petition, he took an appeal to the\nFifth Circuit under 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a71291 and 2253, which\ngrant the courts of appeals jurisdiction to review final\n\u201cdecisions\u201d and \u201corders\u201d of a district court.[2] And when the Fifth Circuit affirmed, petitioner\nsought review in this Court under \u00a71254, which gives us\njurisdiction to review \u201c[c]ases\u201d in the courts of appeals.[3] As respondent correctly notes, these\nprovisions confer jurisdiction to review decisions made by a\ndistrict court in ajudicialcapacity. But we have\nrecognized that not all decisions made by a fed- eral court are\n\u201cjudicial\u201d in nature; some decisions are prop- erly understood to\nbe \u201cadministrative,\u201d and in that case they are \u201cnot subject to our\nreview.\u201dHohnv.United States, 524 U.\u00a0S. 236,\n245 (1998) .The need for federal judges to make many\nadministrative decisions is obvious. The Federal Judiciary, while\ntiny in comparison to the Executive Branch, is nevertheless a large\nand complex institution, with an annual budget exceeding $7 billion\nand more than 32,000 employees. See Administrative Office of the\nU.\u00a0S. Courts, The Judiciary FY 2018 Congressional Budget\nSummary Revised 9\u201310 (June 2017). Administering this operation\nrequires many \u201cdecisions\u201d in the ordinary sense of the\nterm\u2014decisions about such things as facilities, personnel,\nequipment, supplies, and rules of procedure.In re Application\nfor Exemption from Electronic Pub. Access Fees by Jennifer Gollan\nand Shane Shifflett,728 F.\u00a03d 1033, 1037 (CA9 2013). It\nwould be absurd to suggest that every \u201cfinal decision\u201d on any such\nmatter is appealable under \u00a71291 or reviewable in this Court under\n\u00a71254. SeeHohn,supra; 15A C. Wright, A. Miller,\n& E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a73903,\npp.\u00a0134\u2013135 (2d ed. 1992). Such administrative decisions are\nnot the kind of decisions or orders\u2014i.e.,decisions or\norders made in a judicial capacity\u2014to which the relevant\njurisdictional provisions apply.Respondent argues that the denial of\npetitioner\u2019s funding request was just such an administrative\ndecision, but the District Court\u2019s ruling does not remotely\nresemble the sort of administrative decisions noted above.\nPetitioner\u2019s request was made by motion in his federal habeas\nproceeding, which is indisputably a judicial proceeding. And as we\nwill explain, resolution of the funding question requires the\napplication of a legal standard\u2014whether the funding is \u201creasonably\nnecessary\u201d for effective representation\u2014that demands an evaluation\nof petitioner\u2019s prospects of obtaining habeas relief. We have never\nheld that a ruling like that is administrative and thus not subject\nto appellate review under the standard jurisdictional\nprovisions.Respondent claims that two factors support the\nconclusion that the funding decision was administrative, but her\nargument is unpersuasive.BRespondent first argues as follows: Judicial\nproceedings must be adversarial; 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a73599(f\u00a0) funding adjudications are not adversarial because\nthe statute allows requests to be decidedex\u00a0parte;\ntherefore, \u00a73599(f\u00a0) funding adjudications are not judicial in\nnature. This reasoning is flawed.It is certainly true that cases and\ncontroversies in our legal system are adversarial in nature,e.g., Bondv.United States, 564 U.\u00a0S. 211, 217\n(2011) ;Aetna Life Ins. Co.v.Haworth, 300\nU.\u00a0S. 227 \u2013241 (1937), but here, both the habeas proceeding as\na whole and the adjudication of the specific issue of funding were\nadversarial. That the habeas proceeding was adversarial is beyond\ndispute. And on the funding question, petitioner and respondent\nplainly have adverse interests and have therefore squared off as\nadversaries. The motion for funding was formally noted as \u201copposed\u201d\non the Disrict Court\u2019s docket. App. 341. That is not surprising: On\none side, petitioner is seeking funding that he hopes will prevent\nhis execution. On the other, respondent wants to enforce the\njudgment of the Texas courts and to do so without undue delay.\nPetitioner and respondent have vigorously litigated the funding\nquestion all the way to this Court.In arguing that the funding dispute is\nnonadversarial, respondent attaches too much importance to the fact\nthat the request was madeex\u00a0parte. As we have noted,\nthe \u201cex\u00a0partenature of a proceeding has not been\nthought to imply that an act otherwise within a judge\u2019s lawful\njurisdiction was deprived of its judicial character.\u201dForresterv.White, 484 U.\u00a0S. 219, 227 (1988)\n.In our adversary system,ex\u00a0partemotions are disfavored, but they have their place. See,e.g.,\nHohn,supra,at 248 (application for COA);Daliav.United States, 441 U.\u00a0S. 238, 255 (1979)\n(application for a search warrant); 50 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71805(a)\n(application to conduct electronic surveillance for foreign\nintelligence); 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72518(3) (applications to\nintercept \u201cwire, oral, or electronic communications\u201d); 15\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71116(d)(1)(A) (application to seize certain\ngoods and counterfeit marks involved in violations of the trademark\nlaws); Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 17(b) (application for witness\nsubpoena); Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 47(c) (generally recognizingex\u00a0partemotions and applications);Ullmannv.United States, 350 U.\u00a0S. 422 \u2013424, 434 (1956)\n(application for an order granting a witness immunity in exchange\nfor self-incriminating testimony);United Statesv.Monsanto, 491 U.\u00a0S. 600 \u2013604 (1989) (motion to freeze\ndefendant\u2019s assets pending trial).Thus, the mere fact that a \u00a73599 funding request\nmay sometimes be madeex\u00a0parteis hardly dispositive.\nSeeHohn, 524 U.\u00a0S., at 249;Tutunv.United\nStates, 270 U.\u00a0S. 568, 577 (1926) .CRespondent\u2019s second argument is based on the\nvener- able principle \u201cthat Congress cannot vest review of the\ndecisions of Article III courts in\u201d entities other than \u201csuperior\ncourts in the Article III hierarchy.\u201dPlautv.Spendthrift Farm, Inc., 514 U.\u00a0S. 211 \u2013219 (1995)\n(citingHayburn\u2019s Case, 2 Dall. 409 (1792)). Respondent\nclaims that \u00a73599 funding decisions may be revised by the Director\nof the Administrative Office of the Courts and that this shows that\nsuch decisions must be administrative. This argument, however,\nrests on a faulty premise. Nothing in \u00a73599 even hints that review\nby the Director of the Administrative Office is allowed.Respondent\u2019s argument rests in part on a handful\nof old lower court cases that appear to have accepted\nAdministrative Office review of Criminal Justice Act of 1964 (CJA)\npayments that had been authorized by a District Court and approved\nby the chief judge of the relevant Circuit. SeeUnited\nStatesv.Aadal, 282 F.\u00a0Supp. 664, 665 (SDNY 1968);United Statesv.Gast, 297 F.\u00a0Supp. 620, 621\u2013622\n(Del. 1969); see alsoUnited Statesv.Hunter, 385\nF.\u00a0Supp. 358, 362 (DC 1974). The basis for these decisions was\na provision of the CJA, 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73006A(h) (1964 ed.),\nstating that CJA payments \u201cshall be made under the supervision of\nthe Director of the Administrative Office of the United States\nCourts.\u201d[4]It is not clear whether these decisions\ncorrectly interpreted the CJA,[5] but in any event, no similar language appears in \u00a73599.\nAnd respondent has not identified a single instance in which the\nDirector of the Administrative Office or any other nonjudicial\nofficer has attempted to review or alter a \u00a73599 decision.Moreover, attorneys\u2019 requests for CJA funds are\nmarkedly different from the funding application at issue here.\nAttorneys appointed under the CJA typically submit those requests\nafter the conclusion of the case, and the prosecution has no stake\nin the resolution of the matter. The judgment in the criminal case\ncannot be affected by a decision on compensation for services that\nhave been completed, and any funds awarded come out of the budget\nof the Judiciary, not the Executive. See 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a73006A(i) (2012 ed.). Thus, the adversaries in the criminal case\nare not pitted against each other. In this case, on the other hand,\nas we have explained, petitioner and respondent have strong adverse\ninterests. For these reasons, we reject respondent\u2019s argument that\nthe adjudication of the funding issue is nonadversarial and\nadministrative.Respondent, however, claims that the funding\ndecision is administrative for an additional reason. \u201cA\n\u00a73599(f\u00a0) funding determination is properly deemed\nadministrative,\u201d she contends, \u201cbecause it .\u00a0.\u00a0. may be\nrevised outside the traditional Article III judicial hierarchy.\u201d\nBrief for Respondent 23. The basis for this argument is a provision\nof \u00a73599 stating that funding in excess of the generally applicable\nstatutory cap of $7,500 must be approved by the chief judge of the\ncircuit or another designated circuit judge. \u00a73599(g)(2). If a\nfunding decision is judicial and not administrative, respondent\nsuggests, it could not be reviewed by a single circuit judge as\nopposed to a panel of three.This argument confuses what is familiar with\nwhat is constitutionally required. Nothing in the Constitution ties\nCongress to the typical structure of appellate review established\nby statute. If Congress wishes to make certain rulings reviewable\nby a single circuit judge, rather than a panel of three, the\nConstitution does not stand in the way.IIISatisfied that we have jurisdiction, we turn\nto the question whether the Court of Appeals applied the correct\nlegal standard when it affirmed the denial of petitioner\u2019s funding\nrequest.Section 3599(a) authorizes federal courts to\nprovide funding to a party who is facing the prospect of a death\nsentence and is \u201cfinancially unable to obtain adequate\nrepresentation or investigative, expert, or other reason- ably\nnecessary services.\u201d The statute applies to defendants in federal\ncases, \u00a73599(a)(1), as well as to state and federal prisoners\nseeking collateral relief in federal court, \u00a73599(a)(2).Here we are concerned not with legal\nrepresentation but with services provided by experts,\ninvestigators, and the like. Such services must be \u201creasonably\nnecessary for the representation of the [applicant]\u201d in order to be\neligible for funding. \u00a73599(f\u00a0). If the statutory standard is\nmet, a court \u201cmay authorize the [applicant\u2019s] attorneys to obtain\nsuch services on [his] behalf.\u201dIbid.The Fifth Circuit has held that individuals\nseeking funding for such services must show that they have a\n\u201csubstantial need\u201d for the services. 817 F.\u00a03d, at 896;Allenv.Stephens, 805 F.\u00a03d 617, 626 (2015);Wardv.Stephens, 777 F.\u00a03d 250, 266, cert.\ndenied, 577 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2015). Petitioner contends that this\ninterpretation is more demanding than the standard\u2014\u201creasonably\nnecessary\u201d\u2014set out in the statute. And although the difference\nbetween the two formulations may not be great, petitioner has a\npoint.In the strictest sense of the term, something is\n\u201cnecessary\u201d only if it is essential. See Webster\u2019s Third New\nInternational Dictionary 1510 (1993) (something is necessary if it\n\u201cmust be by reason of the nature of things,\u201d if it \u201ccannot be\notherwise by reason of inherent qualities\u201d); 10 Oxford English\nDictionary 275\u2013276 (2d ed. 1989) (OED) (defining the adjective\n\u201cnecessary\u201d to mean \u201cessential\u201d). But in ordinary speech, the term\nis often used more loosely to refer to something that is merely\nimportant or strongly desired. (\u201cI need a vacation.\u201d \u201cI need to\ncatch up with an old friend.\u201d) The term is sometimes used in a\nsimilar way in the law. The term \u201cnecessary\u201d in the Necessary and\nProper Clause does not mean \u201cabsolutelynecessary,\u201dMcCullochv.Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 414\u2013415 (1819),\nand a \u201cnecessary\u201d business expense under the Internal Revenue Code,\n26 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7162(a), may be an expense that is merely\nhelpful and appropriate,Commissionerv.Tellier, 383\nU.\u00a0S. 687, 689 (1966) . As Black\u2019s Law Dictionary puts it, the\nterm \u201cmay import absolute physical necessity or inevitability, or\nit may import that which is only convenient, useful, appropriate,\nsuitable, proper, or conducive to the end sought.\u201d Black\u2019s Law\nDictionary 928 (5th ed. 1979) (Black\u2019s).Section 3599 appears to use the term \u201cnecessary\u201d\nto mean something less than essential. The provision applies to\nservices that are \u201creasonably necessary,\u201d but it makes little sense\nto refer to something as being \u201creasonably essential.\u201d What the\nstatutory phrase calls for, we conclude, is a determination by the\ndistrict court, in the exercise of its discretion, as to whether a\nreasonable attorney would regard the services as sufficiently\nimportant, guided by the considerations we set out more fully\nbelow.The Fifth Circuit\u2019s test\u2014\u201csubstantial need\u201d\u2014is\narguably more demanding. We may assume that the term \u201cneed\u201d is\ncomparable to \u201cnecessary\u201d\u2014that is, that something is \u201cneeded\u201d if it\nis \u201cnecessary.\u201d But the term \u201csubstantial\u201d suggests a heavier\nburden than the statutory term \u201creasonably.\u201d Compare 13 OED 291\n(defining \u201creasonably\u201d to mean, among other things,\n\u201c[s]ufficiently, suitably, fairly\u201d; \u201c[f\u00a0]airly or pretty\nwell\u201d) with 17id.,at 66\u201367 (defining \u201csubstantial,\u201d\nwith respect to \u201creasons, causes, evidence,\u201d to mean \u201cfirmly or\nsolidly established\u201d); see also Black\u2019s 1456 (10th ed. 2014)\n(defining \u201creasonable\u201d to mean \u201c[f\u00a0]air, proper, or moderate\nunder the circumstances .\u00a0.\u00a0. See plausible\u201d);id.,at 1656 (defining \u201csubstantial\u201d to mean, among other\nthings, \u201c[i]mportant, essential, and material\u201d).The difference between \u201creasonably necessary\u201d\nand \u201csubstantially need[ed]\u201d may be small, but the Fifth Circuit\nexacerbated the problem by invoking precedent to the effect that a\nhabeas petitioner seeking funding must present \u201ca viable\nconstitutional claim that is not procedurally barred.\u201d 817\nF.\u00a03d, at 895 (internal quotation marks omitted). See also,e.g., Rileyv.Dretke, 362 F.\u00a03d 302, 307 (CA5\n2004) (\u201cA petitioner cannot show a substantial need when his claim\nis procedurally barred from review\u201d);Allen,supra,at 638\u2013639 (describing \u201c\u00a0\u2018our rule that a prisoner cannot show\na substantial need for funds when his claim is procedurally barred\nfrom review\u2019\u00a0\u201d (quotingCrutsingerv.Stephens,\n576 Fed. Appx. 422, 431 (CA5 2014) (per curiam));Ward,supra,at 266 (\u201cThe denial of funding will be\nupheld .\u00a0.\u00a0. when the constitutional claim is\nprocedurally barred\u201d).The Fifth Circuit adopted this rule before our\ndecision inTrevino, but afterTrevino, the rule is\ntoo restrictive.Trevinopermits a Texas prisoner to\novercome the failure to raise a substantial ineffective-assistance\nclaim in state court by showing that state habeas counsel was\nineffective, 569 U.\u00a0S., at 429, and it is possible that\ninvestigation might enable a petitioner to carry that burden. In\nthose cases in which funding stands a credible chance of enabling a\nhabeas petitioner to overcome the obstacle of procedural default,\nit may be error for a district court to refuse funding.Congress has made it clear, however, that\ndistrict courts have broad discretion in assessing requests for\nfunding. Section 3599\u2019s predecessor declared that district courts\n\u201cshall authorize\u201d funding for services deemed \u201creasonably\nnecessary.\u201d 21 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7848(q)(9) (1988 ed.). Applying\nthis provision, courts of appeals reviewed district court funding\ndecisions for abuse of discretion.E.g.,Boninv.Calderon, 59 F.\u00a03d 815, 837 (CA9 1995);In re\nLindsey, 875 F.\u00a02d 1502, 1507, n. 4 (CA11 1989);United\nStatesv.Alden, 767 F.\u00a02d 314, 319 (CA7 1984).\nThen, as part of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act\nof 1996, 110Stat. 1226, Congress changed the verb from \u201cshall\u201d to\n\u201cmay,\u201d and thus made it perfectly clear that determining whether\nfunding is \u201creasonably necessary\u201d is a decision as to which\ndistrict courts enjoy broad discretion. SeeKingdomware\nTechnologies, Inc.v.United States, 579 U.\u00a0S. ___,\n___ (2016) (slip op., at 9).A natural consideration informing the exercise\nof that discretion is the likelihood that the contemplated services\nwill help the applicant win relief. After all, the proposed\nservices must be \u201creasonablynecessary\u201d for the applicant\u2019s\nrepresentation, and it would not be reasonable\u2014in fact, it would be\nquite unreasonable\u2014to think that services are necessary to the\napplicant\u2019s representation if, realistically speaking, they stand\nlittle hope of helping him win relief. Proper application of the\n\u201creasonably necessary\u201d standard thus requires courts to consider\nthe potential merit of the claims that the applicant wants to\npursue, the likelihood that the services will generate useful and\nadmissible evidence, and the prospect that the applicant will be\nable to clear any procedural hurdles standing in the way.To be clear, a funding applicant must not be\nexpected toprovethat he will be able to win relief if\ngiven the services he seeks. But the \u201creasonably necessary\u201d test\nrequires an assessment of the likely utility of the services\nrequested, and \u00a73599(f\u00a0) cannot be read to guarantee that an\napplicant will have enough money to turn over every stone.Petitioner does not deny this. He agrees that an\napplicant must \u201carticulat[e] specific reasons why the services are\nwarranted\u201d\u2014which includes demonstrating that the underlying claim\nis at least \u201c\u00a0\u2018plausible\u2019\u00a0\u201d\u2014and he acknowledges that\nthere may even be cases in which it would be within a court\u2019s\ndiscretion to \u201cdeny funds after a finding of \u2018reasonable\nnecessity.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Brief for Petitioner 43.These interpretive principles are consistent\nwith the way in which \u00a73599\u2019s predecessors were read by the lower\ncourts. See,e.g.,Alden,supra,at 318\u2013319\n(explaining that it was \u201cappropriate for the district court to\nsatisfy itself that [the] defendant may have a plausible defense\nbefore granting the defendant\u2019s .\u00a0.\u00a0. motion for\npsychiatric assistance to aid in that defense,\u201d and that it is not\nproper to use the funding statute to subsidize a \u201c\u00a0\u2018fishing\nexpedition\u2019\u00a0\u201d);United Statesv.Hamlet, 480\nF.\u00a02d 556, 557 (CA5 1973) (per curiam) (upholding\nDistrict Court\u2019s refusal to fund psychiatric services based on the\nDistrict Court\u2019s conclusion that \u201cthe request for psychiatric\nservices was .\u00a0.\u00a0. lacking in merit\u201d because there was\n\u201cno serious possibility that appellant was legally insane at any\ntime pertinent to the crimes committed\u201d). This abundance of\nprecedent shows courts have plenty of experience making the\ndeterminations that \u00a73599(f) contemplates.IVPerhaps anticipating that we might not accept\nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s reading of \u00a73599(f), respondent devotes a\nsubstantial portion of her brief to an alternative ground for\naffirmance that was neither presented nor passed on below.Respondent contends that whatever \u201creasonably\nnecessary\u201d means, funding isnever\u201creasonably necessary\u201d in\na case like this one, where a habeas petitioner seeks to present a\nprocedurally defaulted ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel\nclaim that depends on facts outside the state-court record. Citing\n28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72254(e)(2), respondent contends that the\nfruits of any such investigation would be inadmissible in a federal\nhabeas court.We decline to decide in the first instance\nwhether respondent\u2019s reading of \u00a72254(e)(2) is correct. Petitioner\nagrees that the argument remains open for the Fifth Circuit to\nconsider on remand. Tr. of Oral Arg. 6.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*We conclude that the Fifth Circuit\u2019s\ninterpretation of \u00a73599(f\u00a0) is not a permissible reading of\nthe statute. We therefore vacate the judgment below and remand the\ncase for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.Notes1We also consider a\njurisdictional issue not raised by the parties, namely, whether we\nhave jurisdiction even though no COA has yet been issued. We do not\nhave jurisdiction if jurisdiction was lacking in the Court of\nAppeals, and the jurisdiction of a court of appeals to entertain an\nappeal from a final order in a habeas proceeding is dependent on\nthe issuance of a COA. See 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72253(c)(l);Gonzalezv.Thaler, 565 U.\u00a0S. 134, 142 (2012) .\nIn this case, petitioner appealed an order of the District Court\nthat denied both his request for funding under 18\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73599 and his underlying habeas claims. The\nCourt of Appeals denied a COA as to the merits of his request for\nhabeas relief but held that a COA was not required insofar as\npetitioner challenged the District Court\u2019s denial of funding under\n\u00a73599. The Fifth Circuit relied onHarbisonv.Bell,\n556 U.\u00a0S. 180 (2009) , in which a prisoner appealed from an\norder that denied counsel under \u00a73599 for a state clemency\nproceeding but that did not address the merits of any habeas\npetition. This Court held that a COA was not required. Here,\npetitioner took his appeal from the final order in his habeas\nproceeding. The parties have not briefed whether that difference\nbetweenHarbisonand the present case is relevant or whether\nan appeal from a denial of a \u00a73599 request for funding would fit\nwithin the COA framework, and we find it unnecessary to resolve the\nissue. Though we take no view on the merits, we will assume for the\nsake of argument that the Court of Appeals could not entertain\npetitioner\u2019s \u00a73599 claim without the issuance of a COA. We may\nreview the denial of a COA by the lower courts. See,e.g.,Miller-Elv.Cockrell, 537 U.\u00a0S. 322 \u2013327\n(2003). When the lower courts deny a COA and we conclude that their\nreason for doing so was flawed, we may reverse and remand so that\nthe correct legal standard may be applied. SeeSlackv.McDaniel, 529 U.\u00a0S. 473 \u2013486, 489\u2013490 (2000). We take\nthat course here. As we will explain, the correctness of the rule\napplied by the District Court in denying the funding request was\nnot only debatable; it was erroneous.2In relevant part \u00a71291\ndeclares that \u201c[t]he courts of appeals .\u00a0.\u00a0. shall have\njurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions of the district\ncourts of the United States, the United States District Court for\nthe District of the Canal Zone, the District Court of Guam, and the\nDistrict Court of the Virgin Islands, except where a direct review\nmay be had in the Supreme Court.\u201d Similarly, \u00a72253 provides, as\nrelevant, that \u201c[i]n a habeas corpus proceeding or a proceeding\nunder section 2255 before a district judge, the final order shall\nbe subject to review, on appeal, by the court of appeals for the\ncircuit in which the proceeding is held.\u201d \u00a72253(a).3\u201cCases in the courts of\nappeals may be reviewed by the Supreme Court by .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nwrit of certiorari granted upon the petition of any party to any\ncivil or criminal case, before or after rendition of judgment or\ndecree.\u201d \u00a71254(1).4This language now appears\nat 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73006A(i) (2012 ed.).5As far as we are aware,\nneither the Administrative Office nor any other nonjudicial entity\ncurrently claims the power to revise or reject a CJA compensation\norder issued by a court. Nothing in the CJA Guidelines suggests\nsuch a policy. See generally 7A Guide to Judiciary Policy (May 17,\n2017).",
