I write\nseparately to point out that the foundation on which the Court\nbuilds its latest disparate-impact regime\u2014Griggsv.Duke\nPower Co., 401 U.\u00a0S. 424 (1971) \u2014is made of sand. That\ndecision, which concluded that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of\n1964 authorizes plaintiffs to bring disparate-impact claims,id., at 429\u2013431, represents the triumph of an agency\u2019s\npreferences over Congress\u2019 enactment and of assumption over fact.\nWhatever respectGriggsmerits as a matter ofstare\ndecisis, I would not amplify its error by importing its\ndisparate-impact scheme into yet another statute.IAWe should drop the pretense thatGriggs\u2019 interpretation of Title VII was legitimate. \u201cThe\nCivil Rights Act of 1964 did not include an express prohibition on\npolicies or practices that produce a disparate impact.\u201dRicciv.DeStefano, 557 U.\u00a0S. 557, 577 (2009) .\nIt did not include an implicit one either. Instead, Title VII\u2019s\noperative provision, 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72000e\u20132(a) (1964 ed.),\naddressed only employer decisions motivated by a protected\ncharacteristic. That provision made it \u201can unlawful employment\npractice for an employer\u2014\u201c(1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge\nany individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual\nwith respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges\nof employment,because ofsuch individual\u2019s race, color,\nreligion, sex, or national origin; or\u201c(2) to limit, segregate, or classify his\nemployees in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any\nindividual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely\naffect his status as an employee,because ofsuch\nindividual\u2019s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\u201d \u00a7703,\n78Stat. 255 (emphasis added).[1]Each paragraph in \u00a72000e\u20132(a) is limited to\nactions taken \u201cbecause of\u201d a protected trait, and \u201cthe ordinary\nmeaning of \u2018because of\u2019 is \u2018by reason of\u2019 or \u2018on account\nof,\u2019\u00a0\u201dUniversity of Tex. Southwestern Medical Centerv.Nassar, 570 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 9)\n(some internal quotation marks omitted). Section 2000e\u20132(a) thus\napplies only when a protected characteristic \u201cwas the \u2018reason\u2019 that\nthe employer decided to act.\u201dId., at ___ (slip op., at 10)\n(some internal quotation marks omitted).[2] In other words, \u201cto take action against an\nindividualbecause of\u201d a protected trait \u201cplainly requires\ndiscriminatory intent.\u201d SeeSmithv.City of Jackson,\n544 U.\u00a0S. 228, 249 (2005) (O\u2019Connor, J., joined by Kennedy and\nThomas, JJ., concurring in judgment) (internal quotation marks\nomitted); accord,e.g., Grossv.FBL Financial Services,\nInc., 557 U.\u00a0S. 167, 176 (2009) .No one disputes that understanding of\n\u00a72000e\u20132(a)(1). We have repeatedly explained that a plaintiff\nbringing an action under this provision \u201cmust establish \u2018that the\ndefendant had a discriminatory intent or motive\u2019 for taking a\njob-related action.\u201dRicci,supra,at 577 (quotingWatsonv.Fort Worth Bank & Trust, 487 U.\u00a0S.\n977, 986 (1988) ). The only dispute is whether the same\nlanguage\u2014\u201cbecause of\u201d\u2014means something different in \u00a72000e\u20132(a)(2)\nthan it does in \u00a72000e\u20132(a)(1).The answer to that questionshouldbe\nobvious. We ordinarily presume that \u201cidentical words used in\ndifferent parts of the same act are intended to have the same\nmeaning,\u201dDesert Palace, Inc.v.Costa, 539\nU.\u00a0S. 90, 101 (2003) (internal quotation marks omitted), and\n\u00a72000e\u20132(a)(2) contains nothing to warrant a departure from that\npresumption. That paragraph \u201cuses the phrase \u2018because of\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. [a protected characteristic]\u2019 in precisely the same\nmanner as does the preceding paragraph\u2014to make plain that an\nemployer is liable only if its adverse action against an individual\nismotivated bythe individual\u2019s [protected\ncharacteristic].\u201dSmith,supra,at 249 (opinion of\nO\u2019Connor, J.) (interpreting nearly identical provision of the Age\nDiscrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA)).The only difference between \u00a72000e\u20132(a)(1) and\n\u00a72000e\u20132(a)(2) is the type of employment decisions they address.\nSeeSmith,supra, at 249 (opinion of O\u2019Connor,\nJ.).Section 2000e\u20132(a)(1) addresses hiring, firing, and\nsetting the terms of employment, whereas \u00a72000e\u20132(a)(2) generally\naddresses limiting, segregating, or classifying employees. Butnodecision is an unlawful employment practice under these\nparagraphs unless it occurs \u201cbecause ofsuch individual\u2019s\nrace, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\u201d \u00a7\u00a72000e\u20132(a)(1),\n(2) (emphasis added).Contrary to the majority\u2019s assumption, seeante,at 10\u201313, the fact that \u00a72000e\u20132(a)(2) uses the phrase\n\u201cotherwise adversely affect\u201d in defining the employment decisions\ntargeted by that paragraph does not eliminate its mandate that the\nprohibited decision be made \u201cbecause of\u201d a protected\ncharacteristic. Section 2000e\u20132(a)(2) does not make unlawful all\nemployment decisions that \u201climit, segregate, or classify\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. employees .\u00a0.\u00a0. in any way which would\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. otherwise adversely affect [an individual\u2019s] status\nas an employee,\u201d but those that \u201cotherwise adversely affect [an\nindividual\u2019s] status as an employee,because of such\nindividual\u2019s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\u201d\n(Emphasis added); accord, 78Stat. 255. Reading \u00a72000e\u20132(a)(2) to\nsanction employers solely on the basis of the effects of their\ndecisions would delete an entire clause of this provision, a result\nwe generally try to avoid. Under any fair reading of the text,\nthere can be no doubt that the Title VII enacted by Congress did\nnot permit disparate-impact claims.[3]BThe author of disparate-impact liability under\nTitle VII was not Congress, but the Equal Employment Opportunity\nCommission (EEOC). EEOC\u2019s \u201cown official history of these early\nyears records with unusual candor the commission\u2019s fundamental\ndisagreement with its founding charter, especially Title VII\u2019s\nliteral requirement that the discrimination be intentional.\u201d H.\nGraham, The Civil Rights Era: Origins and Development of National\nPolicy 1960\u20131972, p. 248 (1990). The Commissioners and their legal\nstaff thought that \u201cdiscrimination\u201d had become \u201cless often an\nindividual act of disparate treatment flowing from an evil state of\nmind\u201d and \u201cmore institutionalized.\u201d Jackson, EEOC vs.\nDiscrimination, Inc., 75 The Crisis 16 (1968). They consequently\ndecided they should target employment practices \u201cwhich prove to\nhave a demonstrable racial effect without a clear and convincing\nbusiness motive.\u201dId.,at 16\u201317 (emphasis deleted). EEOC\u2019s\n\u201clegal staff was aware from the beginning that a normal,\ntraditional, and literal interpretation of Title VII could blunt\ntheir efforts\u201d to penalize employers for practices that had a\ndisparate impact, yet chose \u201cto defy Title VII\u2019s restrictions and\nattempt to build a body of case law that would justify [their]\nfocus on effects and [their] disregard of intent.\u201d Graham,supra, at 248, 250.The lack of legal authority for their agenda\napparently did not trouble them much. For example, Alfred\nBlumrosen, one of the principal creators of disparate-impact\nliability at EEOC, rejected what he described as a \u201cdefeatist view\nof Title VII\u201d that saw the statute as a \u201ccompromise\u201d with a limited\nscope. A. Blumrosen, Black Employment and the Law 57\u201358 (1971).\nBlumrosen \u201cfelt that most of the problems confronting the EEOC\ncould be solved by creative interpretation of Title VII which would\nbe upheld by the courts, partly out of deference to the\nadministrators.\u201dId.,at 59.EEOC\u2019s guidelines from those years are a case\nstudy in Blumrosen\u2019s \u201ccreative interpretation.\u201d Although EEOC\nlacked substantive rulemaking authority, seeFaragherv.Boca Raton, 524 U.\u00a0S. 775 , n.\u00a01 (1998) (Thomas,\nJ., dissenting), it repeatedly issued guidelines on the subject of\ndisparate impact. In 1966, for example, EEOC issued guidelines\nsuggesting that the use of employment tests in hiring decisions\ncould violate Title VII based on disparate impact, notwithstanding\nthe statute\u2019s express statement that \u201cit shall not be an unlawful\nemployment practice .\u00a0.\u00a0. to give and to act upon the\nresults of any professionally developed ability test provided that\nsuch test .\u00a0.\u00a0. is notdesigned, intended, or usedto discriminate because of race, color, religion, sex, or national\norigin,\u201d \u00a72000e\u20132(h) (emphasis added). See EEOC, Guidelines on\nEmployment Testing Procedures 2\u20134 (Aug. 24, 1966). EEOC followed\nthis up with a 1970 guideline that was even more explicit,\ndeclaring that, unless certain criteria were met, \u201c[t]he use of any\ntest which adversely affects hiring, promotion, transfer or any\nother employment or membership opportunity of classes protected by\ntitle VII constitutes discrimination.\u201d 35 Fed. Reg. 12334\n(1970).EEOC was initially hesitant to take its approach\nto this Court, but theGriggsplaintiffs forced its hand.\nAfter they lost on their disparate-impact argument in the Court of\nAppeals, EEOC\u2019s deputy general counsel urged the plaintiffs not to\nseek review because he believed \u201c\u00a0\u2018that the record in the case\npresent[ed] a most unappealing situation for finding tests\nunlawful,\u2019\u00a0\u201d even though he found the lower court\u2019s adherence\nto an intent requirement to be \u201c\u00a0\u2018tragic.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Graham,supra,at 385. The plaintiffs ignored his advice. Perhaps\nrealizing that a ruling on its disparate-impact theory was\ninevitable, EEOC filed anamicusbrief in this Court seeking\ndeference for its position.[4]EEOC\u2019s strategy paid off. The Court embraced\nEEOC\u2019s theory of disparate impact, concluding that the agency\u2019s\nposition was \u201centitled to great deference.\u201d SeeGriggs, 401\nU.\u00a0S., at 433\u2013434. With only a brief nod to the text of\n\u00a72000e\u20132(a)(2) in a footnote,id., at 426, n.\u00a01, the\nCourt tied this novel theory of discrimination to \u201cthe statute\u2019s\nperceivedpurpose\u201d and EEOC\u2019s view of the best way of\neffectuating it,Smith, 544 U.\u00a0S.,at 262\n(opinion of O\u2019Connor, J.); seeid.,at 235 (plurality\nopinion). But statutory provisions\u2014not purposes\u2014go through the\nprocess of bicameralism and presentment mandated by our\nConstitution. We should not replace the former with the latter, seeWyethv.Levine, 555 U.\u00a0S. 555, 586 (2009)\n(Thomas, J., concurring in judgment), nor should we transfer our\nresponsibility for interpreting those provisions to administrative\nagencies, let alone ones lacking substantive rulemaking authority,\nseePerezv.Mortgage Bankers Assn., 575 U.\u00a0S.\n___, ___\u2013___ (2015) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment) (slip op.,\nat 8\u201313).IIGriggs\u2019 disparate-impact doctrine\ndefies not only the statutory text, but reality itself. In their\nquest to eradicate what they view as institutionalized\ndiscrimination, disparate-impact proponents doggedly assume that a\ngiven racial disparity at an institution is a product of that\ninstitution rather than a reflection of disparities that exist\noutside of it. See T. Sowell, Intellectuals and Race 132 (2013)\n(Sowell). That might be true, or it might not. Standing alone, the\nfact that a practice has a disparate impact is not conclusive\nevidence, as theGriggsCourt appeared to believe, that a\npractice is \u201cdiscriminatory,\u201d 401 U.\u00a0S., at 431. \u201cAlthough\npresently observed racial imbalancemightresult from past\n[discrimination], racial imbalance can also result from any number\nof innocent private decisions.\u201dParents Involved in Community\nSchoolsv.Seattle School Dist. No. 1, 551 U.\u00a0S.\n701, 750 (2007) (Thomas, J., concurring) (emphasis added).[5] We should not automatically presume\nthat any institution with a neutral practice that happens to\nproduce a racial disparity is guilty of discrimination until proved\ninnocent.As best I can tell, the reason for this\nwholesale inversion of our law\u2019s usual approach is the unstated\u2014and\nunsubstantiated\u2014assumption that, in the absence of discrimination,\nan institution\u2019s racial makeup would mirror that of society. But\nthe absence of racial disparities in multi-ethnic societies has\nbeen the exception, not the rule. When it comes to \u201cproportiona[l]\nrepresent[ation]\u201d of ethnic groups, \u201cfew, if any, societies have\never approximated this description.\u201d D. Horowitz, Ethnic Groups in\nConflict 677 (1985). \u201cAll multi-ethnic societies exhibit a tendency\nfor ethnic groups to engage in different occupations, have\ndifferent levels (and, often, types) of education, receive\ndifferent incomes, and occupy a different place in the social\nhierarchy.\u201d Weiner, The Pursuit of Ethnic Equality Through\nPreferential Policies: A Comparative Public Policy Perspective, in\nFrom Independence to Statehood 64 (R. Goldmann & A. Wilson eds.\n1984).Racial imbalances do not always disfavor\nminorities. At various times in history, \u201cracial or ethnic\nminorities .\u00a0.\u00a0. have owned or directed more than half of\nwhole industries in particular nations.\u201d Sowell 8. These minorities\n\u201chave included the Chinese in Malaysia, the Lebanese in West\nAfrica, Greeks in the Ottoman Empire, Britons in Argentina,\nBelgians in Russia, Jews in Poland, and Spaniards in Chile\u2014among\nmany others.\u201dIbid.(footnotes omitted). \u201cIn the seventeenth\ncentury Ottoman Empire,\u201d this phenomenon was seen in the palace\nitself, where the \u201cmedical staff consisted of 41 Jews and 21\nMuslims.\u201dIbid. And in our own country, for roughly a\nquarter-century now, over 70 percent of National Basketball\nAssociation players have been black. R. Lapchick, D. Donovan, E.\nLoomer, & L. Martinez, Institute for Diversity and Ethics in\nSport, U. of Central Fla., The 2014 Racial and Gender Report Card:\nNational Basketball Association 21 (June 24, 2014). To presume that\nthese and all other measurable disparities are products of racial\ndiscrimination is to ignore the complexities of human\nexistence.Yet, if disparate-impact liability is not based\non this assumption and is instead simply a way to correct for\nimbalances that do not result from any unlawful conduct, it is even\nless justifiable. This Court has repeatedly reaffirmed that\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018racial balancing\u2019\u00a0\u201d by state actors is\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018pat-ently unconstitutional,\u2019\u00a0\u201d even when it supposedly\nsprings from good intentions.Fisherv.University of\nTex. at Austin, 570 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at\n9). And if that \u201cracial balancing\u201d is achieved through\ndisparate-impact claims limited to only some groups\u2014if, for\ninstance, white basketball players cannot bring disparate-impact\nsuits\u2014then we as a Court have constructed a scheme that parcels out\nlegal privileges to individuals on the basis of skin color. A\nproblem with doing so should be obvious: \u201cGovernment action that\nclassifies individuals on the basis of race is inherently suspect.\u201dSchuettev.BAMN, 572 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2014)\n(plurality opinion) (slip op., at 12); accord,id.,at ___\n(Scalia, J., concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 9). That is no\nless true when judges are the ones doing the classifying. Seeid., at ___ (plurality opinion) (slip op., at 12);id.,at ___ (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment) (slip op.,\nat 9). Disparate-impact liability is thus a rule without a reason,\nor at least without a legitimate one.IIIThe decision inGriggswas bad enough,\nbut this Court\u2019s subsequent decisions have allowed it to move to\nother areas of the law. InSmith, for example, a plurality\nof this Court relied onGriggsto include disparate-impact\nliability in the ADEA. See 544 U.\u00a0S., at 236. As both I and\nthe author of today\u2019s majority opinion recognized at the time, that\ndecision was as incorrect as it was regrettable. Seeid.,at\n248\u2013249 (O\u2019Connor, J., joined by Kennedy and Thomas, JJ.,\nconcurring in judgment). Because we knew that Congress did not\ncreate disparate-impact liability under Title VII, we explained\nthat \u201cthere [wa]s no reason to suppose that Congress in 1967\u201d\u2014four\nyears beforeGriggs\u2014\u201ccould have foreseen the interpretation\nof Title VII that was to come.\u201dSmith,supra, at 260\n(opinion of O\u2019Connor, J.). It made little sense to repeatGriggs\u2019 error in a new context.My position remains the same. Whatever deference\nis dueGriggsas a matter ofstare decisis, we should\nat the very least confine it to Title VII. We should not\nincorporate it into statutes such as the Fair Housing Act and the\nADEA, which were passed years before Congress had any reason to\nsuppose that this Court would take the position it did inGriggs. SeeSmith,supra, at 260 (opinion of\nO\u2019Connor, J.).And we should certainly not allow it to\nspread to statutes like the Fair Housing Act, whose operative text,\nunlike that of the ADEA\u2019s, does not even mirror Title VII\u2019s.Today, however, the majority inexplicably\ndeclares that \u201cthe logic ofSmithandGriggs\u201d leads\nto the conclusion that \u201cthe FHA encompasses disparate-impact\nclaims.\u201dAnte,at 11. Justice Alito ably dismantles this\nargument.Post,at 21\u201328 (dissenting opinion). But, even if\nthe majority were correct, I would not join it in following that\n\u201clogic\u201d here. \u201c[E]rroneous precedents need not be extended to their\nlogical end, even when dealing with related provisions that\nnormally would be interpreted in lockstep. Otherwise,stare\ndecisis, designed to be a principle of stability and repose,\nwould become a vehicle of change .\u00a0.\u00a0. distorting the\nlaw.\u201dCBOCS West, Inc.v.Humphries, 553 U.\u00a0S.\n442 \u2013470 (2008) (Thomas, J., dissenting) (footnote omitted). Making\nthe same mistake in different areas of the law furthers neither\ncertainty nor judicial economy. It furthers error.That error will take its toll. The recent\nexperience of the Houston Housing Authority (HHA) illustrates some\nof the many costs of disparate-impact liability. HHA, which\nprovides affordable housing developments to low-income residents of\nHouston, has over 43,000 families on its waiting lists. The\noverwhelming majority of those families are black. Because Houston\nis a majority-minority city with minority concentrations in all but\nthe more affluent areas, any HHA developments built outside of\nthose areas will increase the concentration of racial minorities.\nUnsurprisingly, the threat of disparate-impact suits based on those\nconcentrations has hindered HHA\u2019s efforts to provide affordable\nhousing. State and federal housing agencies have refused to approve\nall but two of HHA\u2019s eight proposed development projects over the\npast two years out of fears of disparate-impact liability. Brief\nfor Houston Housing Authority asAmicus Curiae8\u201312. That\nthe majority believes that these are not \u201c\u00a0\u2018dire\nconsequences,\u2019\u00a0\u201d seeante,at 24, is cold comfort for\nthose who actually need a home.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*I agree with the majority thatGriggs\u201cprovide[s] essential background\u201d in this case,ante,at 10:\nIt shows that our disparate-impact jurisprudence was erroneous from\nits inception. Divorced from text and reality, driven by an agency\nwith its own policy preferences,Griggsbears little\nrelationship to the statutory interpretation we should expect from\na court of law. Today, the majority repeats that error.I respectfully dissent.Notes1The current version of\n\u00a72000e\u20132(a) is almost identical, except that \u00a72000e\u20132(a)(2) makes\nit unlawful for an employer \u201cto limit, segregate, or classify his\nemployeesor applicants for employmentin any way which\nwould deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment\nopportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as an\nemployee, because of such individual\u2019s race, color, religion, sex,\nor national origin.\u201d (Emphasis added.) This change, which does not\nimpact my analysis, was made in 1972. 86Stat. 109.2In 1991, Congress added\n\u00a72000e\u20132(m) to Title VII, which permits a plaintiff to establish\nthat an employer acted \u201cbecause of\u201d a protected characteristic by\nshowing that the characteristic was \u201ca motivating factor\u201d in the\nemployer\u2019s decision. Civil Rights Act of 1991, \u00a7107(a), 105Stat.\n1075. That amended definition obviously does not legitimize\ndisparate-impact liability, which is distinguished from\ndisparate-treatment liability precisely because the former does not\nrequire any discriminatory motive.3Even \u201c[f\u00a0]ans\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. ofGriggs[v.Duke Power Co., 401\nU.\u00a0S. 424 (1971) ,] tend to agree that the decision is\ndifficult to square with the available indications of congressional\nintent.\u201d Lemos, The Consequences of Congress\u2019s Choice of Delegate:\nJudicial and Agency Interpretations of Title VII, 63 Vand.\nL.\u00a0Rev. 363, 399, n. 155 (2010). In the words of one of the\ndecision\u2019s defenders,Griggs\u201cwas poorly reasoned and\nvulnerable to the charge that it represented a significant leap\naway from the expectations of the enacting Congress.\u201d W. Eskridge,\nDynamic Statu-tory Interpretation 78 (1994).4Efforts by Executive\nBranch officials to influence this Court\u2019s disparate-impact\njurisprudence may not be a thing of the past. According to a joint\ncongressional staff report, after we granted a writ of certiorari\ninMagnerv.Gallagher, 564 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2011), to\naddress whether the Fair Housing Act created disparate-impact\nliability, then-Assistant Attorney General Thomas E. Perez\u2014now\nSecretary of Labor\u2014entered into a secret deal with the petitioners\nin that case, various officials of St. Paul, Minnesota, to prevent\nthis Court from answering the question. Perez allegedly promised\nthe officials that the Department of Justice would not intervene in\ntwoqui\u00a0tamcomplaints then pending against St. Paul in\nexchange for the city\u2019s dismissal of the case. See House Committee\non Oversight and Government Reform, Senate Committee on the\nJudiciary, and House Committee on the Judiciary, DOJ\u2019sQuid Pro\nQuoWith St. Paul: How Assistant Attorney General Thomas Perez\nManipulated Justice and Ignored the Rule of Law, Joint Staff\nReport, 113th Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 1\u20132 (2013). Additionally, just\nnine days after we granted a writ of certiorari inMagner,\nand before its dismissal, the De-partment of Housing and Urban\nDevelopment proposed the disparate-impact regulation at issue in\nthis case. See 76 Fed.
