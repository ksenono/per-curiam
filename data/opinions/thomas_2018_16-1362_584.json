The FLSA exempts from the overtime-pay requirement \u201cany\nsalesman, partsman, or mechanic primarily engaged in selling or\nservicing automobiles\u201d at a covered dealership. \u00a7213(b)(10)(A). We\ngranted certiorari to decide whether this exemption applies to\nservice advisors\u2014employees at car dealerships who consult with\ncustomers about their servicing needs and sell them servicing\nsolutions. We conclude that service advisors are exempt.IAEnacted in 1938, the FLSA requires employers\nto pay overtime to covered employees who work more than 40 hours in\na week. 29 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7207(a). But the FLSA exempts many\ncategories of employees from this requirement. See \u00a7213. Employees\nat car dealerships have long been among those exempted.Congress initially exempted all employees at car\ndealerships from the overtime-pay requirement. See Fair Labor\nStandards Amendments of 1961, \u00a79, 75Stat. 73. Congress then\nnarrowed that exemption to cover \u201cany salesman, partsman, or\nmechanic primarily engaged in selling or servicing automobiles,\ntrailers, trucks, farm implements, or aircraft.\u201d Fair Labor\nStandards Amendments of 1966, \u00a7209, 80Stat. 836. In 1974, Congress\nenacted the version of the exemption at issue here. It provides\nthat the FLSA\u2019s overtime-pay requirement does not apply to \u201cany\nsalesman, partsman, or mechanic primarily engaged in selling or\nservicing automobiles, trucks, or farm implements, if he is\nemployed by a nonmanufacturing establishment primarily engaged in\nthe business of selling such vehicles or implements to ultimate\npurchasers.\u201d \u00a7213(b)(10)(A).This language has long been understood to cover\nservice advisors. Although the Department of Labor initially\ninterpreted it to exclude them, 35 Fed. Reg. 5896 (1970) (codified\nat 29 CFR \u00a7779.372(c)(4) (1971)), the federal courts rejected that\nview, seeBrennanv.Deel Motors, Inc., 475\nF.\u00a02d 1095 (CA5 1973);Brennanv.North Bros. Ford,\nInc., 76 CCH LC \u00b633, 247 (ED Mich. 1975), aff\u2019dsub\u00a0nom.Dunlopv.North Bros. Ford,\nInc., 529 F.\u00a02d 524 (CA6 1976) (table). After these\ndecisions, the Department issued an opinion letter in 1978,\nexplaining that service advisors are exempt in most cases. See\nDept. of Labor, Wage & Hour Div., Opinion Letter No. 1520\n(WH\u2013467) (1978), [1978\u20131981 Transfer Binder] CCH Wages\u2013Hours\nAdministrative Rulings \u00b631,207. From 1978 to 2011, Congress made no\nchanges to the exemption, despite amending \u00a7213 nearly a dozen\ntimes. The Department also continued to acquiesce in the view that\nservice advisors are exempt. See Dept. of Labor, Wage & Hour\nDiv., Field Operations Handbook, Insert No. 1757, 24L04(k) (Oct.\n20, 1987), online at https://perma.cc/5GHD-KCJJ (as last visited\nMar. 28, 2018).In 2011, however, the Department reversed\ncourse. It issued a rule that interpreted \u201csalesman\u201d to exclude\nservice advisors. 76 Fed. Reg. 18832, 18859 (2011) (codified at 29\nCFR \u00a7779.372(c)). That regulation prompted this litigation.BPetitioner Encino Motorcars, LLC, is a\nMercedes-Benz dealership in California. Respondents are current and\nformer service advisors for petitioner. Service advisors \u201cinteract\nwith customers and sell them services for their vehicles.\u201dEncino Motorcars, LLCv.Navarro, 579 U.\u00a0S. ___,\n___ (2016) (Encino I) (slip op., at 2). They \u201cmee[t]\ncustomers; liste[n] to their concerns about their cars; sugges[t]\nrepair and maintenance services; sel[l] new accessories or\nreplacement parts; recor[d] service orders; follo[w] up with\ncustomers as the services are performed (for instance, if new\nproblems are discovered); and explai[n] the repair and maintenance\nwork when customers return for their vehicles.\u201dIbid.In 2012, respondents sued petitioner for\nbackpay. Relying on the Department\u2019s 2011 regulation, respondents\nalleged that petitioner had violated the FLSA by failing to pay\nthem overtime. Petitioner moved to dismiss, arguing that service\nadvisors are exempt under \u00a7213(b)(10)(A). The District Court agreed\nwith petitioner and dismissed the complaint, but the Court of\nAppeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed. Finding the text ambiguous\nand the legislative history \u201cinconclusive,\u201d the Ninth Circuit\ndeferred to the Department\u2019s 2011 rule underChevron\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0A. Inc.v.Natural Resources Defense\nCouncil, Inc., 467 U.\u00a0S. 837 (1984) .Encino, 780\nF.\u00a03d 1267, 1275 (2015).We granted certiorari and vacated the Ninth\nCircuit\u2019s judgment. We explained that courts cannot defer to the\n2011 rule because it is procedurally defective. SeeEncino\nI,579 U.\u00a0S., at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 8\u201312).\nSpecifically, the regulation undermined significant reliance\ninterests in the automobile industry by changing the treatment of\nservice advisors without a sufficiently reasoned explanation.Id.,at ___ (slip op., at 10). But we did not decide\nwhether, without administrative deference, the exemption covers\nservice advisors.Id.,at ___ (slip op., at 12). We remanded\nthat issue for the Ninth Circuit to address in the first instance.Ibid.COn remand, the Ninth Circuit again held that\nthe exemption does not include service advisors. The Court of\nAppeals agreed that a service advisor is a \u201c\u00a0\u2018salesman\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nin a \u201cgeneric sense,\u201d 845 F.\u00a03d 925,930 (2017), and is\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018primarily engaged in .\u00a0.\u00a0. servicing\nautomobiles\u2019\u00a0\u201d in a \u201cgeneral sense,\u201did., at 931.\nNonetheless, it concluded that \u201cCongress did not intend to exempt\nservice advisors.\u201dId., at 929.The Ninth Circuit began by noting that the\nDepartment\u2019s 1966\u20131967 Occupational Outlook Handbook listed 12 job\ntitles in the table of contents that could be found at a car\ndealership, including \u201cautomobile mechanics,\u201d \u201cautomobile parts\ncountermen,\u201d \u201cautomobile salesmen,\u201d and \u201cautomobile service\nadvisors.\u201dId.,at 930. Because the FLSA exemption listed\nthree of these positions, but not service advisors, the Ninth\nCircuit concluded that service advisors are not exempt.Ibid.The Ninth Circuit also determined that service\nadvisors are not primarily engaged in \u201cservicing\u201d automobiles,\nwhich it defined to mean \u201conly those who are actually occupied in\nthe repair and maintenance of cars.\u201dId.,at 931. And the\nNinth Circuit further concluded that the exemption does not cover\nsalesmen who are primarily engaged in servicing.Id.,at\n933. In reaching this conclusion, the Ninth Circuit invoked the\ndistributive canon. See A. Scalia & B. Garner, Reading Law 214\n(2012) (\u201cDistributive phrasing applies each expression to its\nappropriate referent\u201d). It reasoned that \u201cCongress intended the\ngerunds\u2014selling and servicing\u2014to be distributed to their\nappropriate subjects\u2014salesman, partsman, and mechanic. A salesman\nsells; a partsman services; and a mechanic services.\u201dId.,at 934. Finally, the Court of Appeals noted that its interpretation\nwas supported by the principle that exemptions to the FLSA should\nbe construed narrowly,id., at 935, and the lack of any\n\u201cmention of service advisors\u201d in the legislative history,id., at 939.We granted certiorari, 582 U.\u00a0S. ___\n(2017), and now reverse.IIThe FLSA exempts from its overtime-pay\nrequirement \u201cany salesman, partsman, or mechanic primarily engaged\nin selling or servicing automobiles, trucks, or farm implements, if\nhe is employed by a nonmanufacturing establishment primarily\nengaged in the business of selling such vehicles or implements to\nultimate purchasers.\u201d \u00a7213(b)(10)(A). The parties agree that\npetitioner is a \u201cnonmanufacturing establishment primarily engaged\nin the business of selling [automobiles] to ultimate purchasers.\u201d\nThe parties also agree that a service advisor is not a \u201cpartsman\u201d\nor \u201cmechanic,\u201d and that a service advisor is not \u201cprimarily engaged\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. in selling automobiles.\u201d The question, then, is\nwhether service advisors are \u201csalesm[e]n .\u00a0.\u00a0. primarily\nengaged in .\u00a0.\u00a0. servicing automobiles.\u201d We conclude that\nthey are. Under the best reading of the text, service advisors are\n\u201csalesm[e]n,\u201d and they are \u201cprimarily engaged in .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nservicing automobiles.\u201d The distributive canon, the practice of\nconstruing FLSA exemptions narrowly, and the legislative history do\nnot persuade us otherwise.AA service advisor is obviously a \u201csalesman.\u201d\nThe term \u201csalesman\u201d is not defined in the statute, so \u201cwe give the\nterm its ordinary meaning.\u201dTaniguchiv.Kan Pacific\nSaipan, Ltd., 566 U.\u00a0S. 560, 566 (2012) . The ordinary\nmeaning of \u201csalesman\u201d is someone who sells goods or services. See\n14 Oxford English Dictionary 391 (2d ed. 1989) (\u201c[a] man whose\nbusiness it is to sell goods or conduct sales\u201d); Random House\nDictionary of the English Language 1262 (1966) (\u201ca man who sells\ngoods, services, etc.\u201d). Service advisors do precisely that. As\nthis Court previously explained, service advisors \u201csell [customers]\nservices for their vehicles.\u201dEncino I,579 U.\u00a0S., at\n___ (slip op., at 2).BService advisors are also \u201cprimarily engaged\nin .\u00a0.\u00a0. servicing automobiles.\u201d \u00a7213(b)(10)(A). The word\n\u201cservicing\u201d in this context can mean either \u201cthe action of\nmaintaining or repairing a motor vehicle\u201d or \u201c[t]he action of\nproviding a service.\u201d 15 Oxford English Dictionary, at 39; see also\nRandom House Dictionary of the English Language, at 1304 (\u201cto make\nfit for use; repair; restore to condition for service\u201d). Service\nadvisors satisfy both definitions. Service advisors are integral to\nthe servicing process. They \u201cmee[t] customers; liste[n] to their\nconcerns about their cars; sugges[t] repair and maintenance\nservices; sel[l] new accessories or replacement parts; recor[d]\nservice orders; follo[w] up with customers as the services are\nperformed (for instance, if new problems are discovered); and\nexplai[n] the repair and maintenance work when customers return for\ntheir vehicles.\u201dEncino I,supra, at ___ (slip op.,\nat 2). If you ask the average customer who services his car, the\nprimary, and perhaps only, person he is likely to identify is his\nservice advisor.True, service advisors do not spend most of\ntheir time physically repairing automobiles. But the statutory\nlanguage is not so constrained. All agree that partsmen, for\nexample, are \u201cprimarily engaged in .\u00a0.\u00a0. servicing\nautomobiles.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 40; Brief for Respondents 41\u201344.\nBut partsmen, like service advisors, do not spend most of their\ntime under the hood. Instead, they \u201cobtain the vehicle parts\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. and provide those parts to the mechanics.\u201dEncino I, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 2); see also 1 Dept.\nof Labor, Dictionary of Occupational Titles 33 (3d ed. 1965)\n(defining \u201cpartsman\u201d as someone who \u201c[p]urchases, stores, and\nissues spare parts for automotive and industrial equipment\u201d). In\nother words, the phrase \u201cprimarily engaged in .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nservicing automobiles\u201d must include some individuals who do not\nphysically repair automobiles themselves but who are integrally\ninvolved in the servicing process. That description applies to\npartsmen and service advisors alike.CThe Ninth Circuit concluded that service\nadvisors are not covered because the exemption simply does not\napply to \u201csalesm[e]n .\u00a0.\u00a0. primarily engaged in\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. servicing automobiles.\u201d The Ninth Circuit invoked\nthe distributive canon to reach this conclusion. Using that canon,\nit matched \u201csalesman\u201d with \u201cselling\u201d and \u201cpartsma[n] [and]\nmechanic\u201d with \u201cservicing.\u201d We reject this reasoning.The text of the exemption covers \u201cany salesman,\npartsman, or mechanic primarily engaged in selling or servicing\nautomobiles, trucks, or farm implements.\u201d \u00a7213(b)(10)(A). The\nexemption uses the word \u201cor\u201d to connect all of its nouns and\ngerunds, and \u201cor\u201d is \u201calmost always disjunctive.\u201dUnited\nStatesv.Woods,571 U.\u00a0S. 31, 45 (2013) . Thus,\nthe use of \u201cor\u201d to join \u201cselling\u201d and \u201cservicing\u201d suggests that the\nexemption covers a salesman primarily engaged in either\nactivity.Unsurprisingly, statutory context can overcome\nthe ordinary, disjunctive meaning of \u201cor.\u201d The distributive canon,\nfor example, recognizes that sometimes \u201c[w]here a sentence contains\nseveral antecedents and several consequents,\u201d courts should \u201cread\nthem distributively and apply the words to the subjects which, by\ncontext, they seem most properly to relate.\u201d 2A N. Singer & S.\nSinger, Sutherland Statutes and Statutory Construction \u00a747:26,\np.\u00a0448 (rev. 7th ed. 2014).But here, context favors the ordinary\ndisjunctive meaning of \u201cor\u201d for at least three reasons. First, the\ndistributive canon has the most force when the statute allows for\none-to-one matching. But here, the distributive canon would mix and\nmatch some of three nouns\u2014\u201csalesman, partsman, or mechanic\u201d\u2014with\none of two gerunds\u2014\u201cselling or servicing.\u201d \u00a7213(b)(10)(A). We doubt\nthat a legislative drafter would leave it to the reader to figure\nout the precise combinations. Second, the distributive canon has\nthe most force when an ordinary, disjunctive reading is\nlinguistically impossible. Cf.,e.g., Huidekoper\u2019s Lesseev.Douglass, 3 Cranch 1, 67 (1805) (Marshall, C.\u00a0J.)\n(applying the distributive canon when a purely disjunctive reading\n\u201cwould involve a contradiction in terms\u201d). But as explained above,\nthe phrase \u201csalesman .\u00a0.\u00a0. primarily engaged in\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. servicing automobiles\u201d not only makes sense; it is\nan apt description of a service advisor. Third, a narrow\ndistributive phrasing is an unnatural fit here because the entire\nexemption bespeaks breadth. It begins with the word \u201cany.\u201d SeeAliv.Federal Bureau ofPrisons, 552\nU.\u00a0S. 214, 219 (2008) (noting the \u201cexpansive meaning\u201d of\n\u201cany\u201d). And it uses the disjunctive word \u201cor\u201d three times. In fact,\nall agree that the third list in the exemption\u2014\u201cautomobiles,\ntrucks, or farm implements\u201d\u2014modifies every other noun and gerund.\nBut it would be odd to read the exemption as starting with a\ndistributive phrasing and then, halfway through and without\nwarning, switching to a disjunctive phrasing\u2014all the while using\nthe same word (\u201cor\u201d) to signal both meanings. SeeBrownv.Gardner, 513 U.\u00a0S. 115, 118 (1994) (noting the\n\u201cvigorous\u201d presumption that, \u201cwhen a term is repeated within a\ngiven sentence,\u201d it \u201cis used to mean the same thing\u201d). The more\nnatural reading is that the exemption covers any combination of its\nnouns, gerunds, and objects.DThe Ninth Circuit also invoked the principle\nthat exemptions to the FLSA should be construed narrowly. 845\nF.\u00a03d, at 935\u2013936. We reject this principle as a useful\nguidepost for interpreting the FLSA. Because the FLSA gives no\n\u201ctextual indication\u201d that its exemptions should be construed\nnarrowly, \u201cthere is no reason to give [them] anything other than a\nfair (rather than a \u2018narrow\u2019) interpretation.\u201d Scalia, Reading Law,\nat 363. The narrow-construction principle relies on the flawed\npremise that the FLSA \u201c\u00a0\u2018pursues\u2019\u00a0\u201d its remedial purpose\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018at all costs.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAmerican Express Co.v.Italian Colors Restaurant, 570 U.\u00a0S. 228, 234 (2013)\n(quotingRodriguezv.United States, 480 U.\u00a0S.\n522 \u2013526 (1987) (per curiam)); see alsoHensonv.Santander Consumer USA Inc., 582 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2017)\n(slip op., at 9) (\u201c[I]t is quite mistaken to assume .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nthat whatever might appear to further the statute\u2019s primary\nobjective must be the law\u201d (internal quotation marks and\nalterations omitted)). But the FLSA has over two dozen exemptions\nin \u00a7213(b) alone, including the one at issue here. Those exemptions\nare as much a part of the FLSA\u2019s purpose as the overtime-pay\nrequirement. Seeid., at ___ (slip op., at 9) (\u201cLegislation\nis, after all, the art of compromise, the limitations expressed in\nstatutory terms often the price of passage\u201d). We thus have no\nlicense to give the exemption anything but a fair reading.EFinally, the Ninth Circuit relied on two\nextraneous sources to support its interpretation: the Department\u2019s\n1966\u20131967 Occupational Outlook Handbook and the FLSA\u2019s legislative\nhistory. We find neither persuasive.1The Ninth Circuit first relied on the\nDepartment\u2019s 1966\u20131967 Occupational Outlook Handbook. It identified\n12 jobs from the Handbook\u2019s table of contents that it thought could\nbe found at automobile dealerships. See 845 F.\u00a03d, at 930. The\nNinth Circuit then stressed that the exemption aligns with three of\nthose job titles\u2014\u201c[a]utomobile mechanics,\u201d \u201c[a]utomobile parts\ncountermen,\u201d and \u201c[a]utomobile salesmen\u201d\u2014but not \u201c[a]utomobile\nservice advisors.\u201dIbid.The Ninth Circuit cited nothing, however,\nsuggesting that the exemption was meant to align with the job\ntitles listed in the Handbook. To the contrary, the exemption\napplies to \u201cany salesman .\u00a0.\u00a0. primarily engaged in\nselling or servicing automobiles.\u201d It is not limited, like the term\nin the Handbook, to \u201cautomobile salesmen.\u201d And the ordinary meaning\nof \u201csalesman\u201d plainly includes service advisors.2The Ninth Circuit also relied on legislative\nhistory to support its interpretation. Seeid., at 936\u2013939.\nSpecifi- cally, it noted that the legislative history discusses\n\u201cautomobile salesmen, partsmen, and mechanics\u201d but never discusses\nservice advisors.Id., at 939. Although the Ninth Circuit\nhad previously found that same legislative history \u201cinconclusive,\u201dEncino, 780 F.\u00a03d, at 1275, on remand it was \u201cfirmly\npersuaded\u201d that the legislative history demonstrated Congress\u2019\ndesire to exclude service advisors, 845 F.\u00a03d, at 939.The Ninth Circuit was right the first time. As\nwe have explained, the best reading of the statute is that service\nadvisors are exempt. Even for those Members of this Court who\nconsider legislative history, silence in the legislative history,\n\u201cno matter how \u2018clanging,\u2019\u00a0\u201d cannot defeat the better reading\nof the text and statutory context.Sedima, S. P. R. L.v.Imrex Co., 473 U.\u00a0S. 479 , n.\u00a013 (1985). If the\ntext is clear, it needs no repetition in the legislative history;\nand if the text is ambiguous, silence in the legislative history\ncannot lend any clarity. SeeAvco Corp.v.Department of\nJustice, 884 F.\u00a02d 621, 625 (CADC 1989). Even if Congress\ndid not foresee all of the applications of the statute, that is no\nreason not to give the statutory text a fair reading. SeeUnion\nBankv.Wolas, 502 U.\u00a0S. 151, 158 (1991) .*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*In sum, we conclude that service advisors are\nexempt from the overtime-pay requirement of the FLSA because they\nare \u201csalesm[e]n .\u00a0.\u00a0. primarily engaged in\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. servicing automobiles.\u201d \u00a7213(b)(10)(A).\nAccordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and\nremand the case for further proceedings consistent with this\nopinion.It is so ordered.",
