HOLDER, Jr., ATTORNEY GENERALon writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the fifth circuit[June 14, 2010]Justice Thomas, concurring in the\njudgment.A plain reading of 18 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a7924(c)(2) identifies two requirements that must be\nsatisfied for Carachuri-Rosendo\u2019s state conviction to qualify as a\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018drug trafficking crime\u2019\u00a0\u201d that renders him ineligible\nfor cancellation of removal:* \u201cFirst, the offense must be a felony;\nsecond, the offense must be capable of punishment under the\nControlled Substances Act (CSA).\u201dLopezv.Gonzales,549 U. S. 47, 61 (2006)\n(Thomas, J., dissenting). Carachuri-Rosendo\u2019s offense of simple\npossession was \u201cpunishable under the [CSA],\u201d \u00a7924(c)(2), and thus\nsatisfied the second requirement, but his crime of conviction in\nstate court was only a misdemeanor. Accordingly, that offense does\nnot bar him from obtaining cancellation of removal.The Fifth Circuit understandably felt\nconstrained by this Court\u2019s decision inLopezto rule\notherwise. InLopez,this Court held that \u201ca state offense\nconstitutes a \u2018felony punishable under the [CSA]\u2019 only if it\nproscribes conduct punishableas a felonyunder that\nfederal law.\u201dId., at 60 (emphasis added). ThoughLopezaddressed a felony conviction under state law that\ndid not correlate to a felony under the CSA, the Court\u2019s rule\npreordained the result in this case:\u201c[T]he Court admits that its reading will subject\nan alien defendant convicted of a state misdemeanor to deportation\nif his conduct was punishable as a felony under the CSA.\nAccordingly, even if never convicted of an actual felony, an alien\ndefendant becomes eligible for deportation based on a hypothetical\nfederal prosecution.\u201dId., at 67 (Thomas, J.,\ndissenting).Today, the Court engages in\njurisprudential gymnastics to avoid Lopez.I will not contort\nthe law to fit the case.Lopezwas wrongly decided. But\nbecause a proper reading of the statutory text, seeid.,at 60\u201363, supports the result the Court reaches today, I concur in\nthe judgment.*\u00a0See 8 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71229b(a) (permitting\ncancellation of removal); \u00a71229b(a)(3) (barring aliens convicted of\nan \u201caggravated felony\u201d from cancellation of removal);\n\u00a71101(a)(43)(B) (defining \u201caggravated felony\u201d as \u201cillicit\ntrafficking in a controlled substance . . . including a drug\ntrafficking crime (as defined in [18 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7924(c)])\u201d); 18\nU. S.\u00a0C \u00a7924(c)(2) (defining \u201cdrug trafficking crime\u201d to mean\n\u201cany felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act\u201d).",
