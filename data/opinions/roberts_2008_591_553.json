    "text": "OPINION OF THE COURTENGQUIST V. OREGON DEPT. OF AGRICULTURE553 U. S. ____ (2008)SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESNO. 07-474ANUP ENGQUIST, PETITIONERv.OREGON\nDEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE et\u00a0al.on writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the ninth circuit[June 9, 2008]Chief Justice Roberts delivered\nthe opinion of the Court.The question in this case is\nwhether a public employee can state a claim under the Equal\nProtection Clause by alleging that she was arbitrarily treated\ndifferently from other similarly situated employees, with no\nassertion that the different treatment was based on the employee\u2019s\nmembership in any particular class. We hold that such a\n\u201cclass-of-one\u201d theory of equal protection has no place in the\npublic employment context.IAnup Engquist, the petitioner in\nthis case, was hired in 1992 by Norma Corristan to be an\ninternational food standard specialist for the Export Service\nCenter (ESC), a laboratory within the Oregon Department of\nAgriculture (ODA). During the course of her employment, Engquist\nexperienced repeated problems with Joseph Hyatt, another ODA\nemployee, complaining to Corristan that he had made false\nstatements about her and otherwise made her life difficult.\nCorristan responded by directing Hyatt to attend diversity and\nanger management training.In 2001, John Szczepanski, an\nassistant director of ODA, assumed responsibility over ESC,\nsupervising Corristan, Hyatt, and Engquist. Szczepanski told a\nclient that he could not \u201ccontrol\u201d Engquist, and that Engquist and\nCorristan \u201cwould be gotten rid of.\u201d When Engquist and Hyatt both\napplied for a vacant managerial post within ESC, Szczepanski chose\nHyatt despite Engquist\u2019s greater experience in the relevant field.\nLater that year, during a round of across-the-board budget cuts in\nOregon, Szczepanski eliminated Corristan\u2019s position. Finally, on\nJanuary 31, 2002, Engquist was informed that her position was being\neliminated because of reorganization. Engquist\u2019s\ncollective-bargaining agreement gave her the opportunity either to\n\u201cbump\u201d to another position at her level, or to take a demotion. She\nwas found unqualified for the only other position at her level and\ndeclined a demotion, and was therefore effectively laid off.Engquist subsequently brought suit in the\nUnited States District Court for the District of Oregon against\nODA, Szczepanski, and Hyatt, all respondents here, alleging\nviolations of federal antidiscrimination statutes, the Equal\nProtection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, and\nstate law. As to Engquist\u2019s equal protection claim, she alleged\nthat the defendants discriminated against her on the basis of her\nrace, sex, and national origin. She also brought what is known as a\n\u201cclass-of-one\u201d equal protection claim, alleging that she was fired\nnot because she was a member of an identified class (unlike her\nrace, sex, and national origin claims), but simply for \u201carbitrary,\nvindictive, and malicious reasons.\u201d App. 10.The District Court granted the respondents\u2019\nmotion for summary judgment as to some of Engquist\u2019s claims, but\nallowed others to go forward, including each of the equal\nprotection claims. As relevant to this case, the District Court\nfound Engquist\u2019s class-of-one equal protection claim legally\nviable, deciding that the class-of-one theory was fully applicable\nin the employment context. Civ. No. 02\u20131637\u2013AS (D. Ore., Sept. 14,\n2004), App. 58, 2004 WL 2066748, *5. The court held that Engquist\ncould succeed on that theory if she could prove \u201cthat she was\nsingled out as a result of animosity on the part of Hyatt and\nSzczepanski\u201d\u2014i.e., \u201cthat their actions were spiteful\nefforts to punish her for reasons unrelated to any legitimate state\nobjective\u201d\u2014and if she could demonstrate, on the basis of that\nanimosity, that \u201cshe was treated differently than others who were\nsimilarly situated.\u201dIbid.The jury rejected Engquist\u2019s claims of\ndiscrimination for membership in a suspect class\u2014her race, sex, and\nnational origin claims\u2014but found in her favor on the class-of-one\nclaim. Specifically, the jury found that Hyatt and Szczepanski\n\u201cintentionally treat[ed] [Engquist] differently than others\nsimilarly situated with respect to the denial of her promotion,\ntermination of her employment, or denial of bumping rights without\nany rational basis and solely for arbitrary, vindictive or\nmalicious reasons.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 3\u20134. The jury also found\nfor Engquist on several of her other claims, and awarded her\n$175,000 in compensatory damages and $250,000 in punitive\ndamages.The Court of Appeals reversed in relevant\npart. It recognized that this Court had upheld a class-of-one equal\nprotection challenge to state legislative and regulatory action inVillage of Willowbrookv.Olech,528 U. S. 562(2000)\n(per curiam). 478 F.\u00a03d 985, 992\u2013993 (CA9 2007). The\ncourt below also acknowledged that other Circuits had appliedOlechin the public employment context,id., at\n993 (citing cases), but it disagreed with those courts on the\nground that our cases have routinely afforded government greater\nleeway when it acts as employer rather than regulator,id., at 993\u2013996. The court concluded that extending the\nclass-of-one theory of equal protection to the public employment\ncontext would lead to undue judicial interference in state\nemployment practices and \u201ccompletely invalidate the practice of\npublic at-will employment.\u201dId., at 995. The court\naccordingly held that the class-of-one theory is \u201cinapplicable to\ndecisions made by public employers with regard to their employees.\u201dId., at 996.Judge Reinhardt dissented, \u201cagree[ing] with\nthe other circuits that the class-of-one theory of equal protection\nis applicable to public employment decisions.\u201dId., at\n1010. We granted certiorari to resolve this disagreement in the\nlower courts, 552 U. S. __ (2008), and now affirm.IIEngquist argues that the Equal\nProtection Clause forbids public employers from irrationally\ntreating one employee differently from others similarly situated,\nregardless of whether the different treatment is based on the\nemployee\u2019s membership in a particular class. She reasons that inOlech,supra, we recognized in the regulatory\ncontext a similar class-of-one theory of equal protection, Brief\nfor Petitioner 14\u201315; that the Equal Protection Clause protects\nindividuals, not classes,id., at 15\u201317; that the Clause\nproscribes \u201cdiscrimination arising not only from a legislative act\nbut also from the conduct of an administrative official,\u201did., at 17; and that the Constitution applies to the State\nnot only when it acts as regulator, but also when it acts as\nemployer,id., at 23\u201329. Thus, Engquist concludes that\nclass-of-one claims can be brought against public employers just as\nagainst any other state actors,id., at 29\u201332, and that\ndifferential treatment of government employees\u2014even when not based\non membership in a class or group\u2014violates the Equal Protection\nClause unless supported by a rational basis,id., at 32,\n39\u201345.We do not quarrel with the\npremises of Engquist\u2019s argument. It is well settled that the Equal\nProtection Clause \u201cprotect[s] persons, not groups,\u201dAdarand\nConstructors, Inc.v.Pe&nacute;a,515 U. S. 200, 227\n(1995) (emphasis omitted), and that the Clause\u2019s protections apply\nto administrative as well as legislative acts, see,e.g.,\nRaymondv.Chicago Union Traction Co.,207 U. S. 20, 35\u201336\n(1907). It is equally well settled that States do not escape the\nstrictures of the Equal Protection Clause in their role as\nemployers. See,e.g.,New York City Transit\nAuthorityv.Beazer,440 U. S. 568(1979);Harrah Independent School Dist.v.Martin,440 U. S. 194(1979) (per curiam);Massachusetts Bd. of\nRetirementv.Murgia,427 U. S. 307(1976)\n(per curiam). We do not, however, agree that Engquist\u2019s\nconclusion follows from these premises. Our traditional view of the\ncore concern of the Equal Protection Clause as a shield against\narbitrary classifications, combined with unique considerations\napplicable when the government acts as employer as opposed to\nsovereign, lead us to conclude that the class-of-one theory of\nequal protection does not apply in the public employment\ncontext.AWe have long held the view that\nthere is a crucial difference, with respect to constitutional\nanalysis, between the government exercising \u201cthe power to regulate\nor license, as lawmaker,\u201d and the government acting \u201cas proprietor,\nto manage [its] internal operation.\u201dCafeteria & Restaurant\nWorkersv.McElroy,367 U. S. 886, 896\n(1961). This distinction has been particularly clear in our review\nof state action in the context of public employment. Thus, \u201cthe\ngovernment as employer indeed has far broader powers than does the\ngovernment as sovereign.\u201dWatersv.Churchill,511 U. S. 661,\n671 (1994) (plurality opinion). \u201c[T]he extra power the government\nhas in this area comes from the nature of the government\u2019s mission\nas employer. Government agencies are charged by law with doing\nparticular tasks. Agencies hire employees to help do those tasks as\neffectively and efficiently as possible.\u201dId., at 674\u2013675.\nSee alsoConnickv.Myers,461 U. S. 138, 150\u2013151\n(1983) (explaining that the government has a legitimate interest\n\u201cin \u2018promot[ing] efficiency and integrity in the discharge of\nofficial duties, and [in] maintain[ing] proper discipline in the\npublic service\u2019\u00a0\u201d (quotingEx parte Curtis,106 U. S. 371, 373\n(1882) (alterations in original))). \u201cThe government\u2019s interest in\nachieving its goals as effectively and efficiently as possible is\nelevated from a relatively subordinate interest when it acts as\nsovereign to a significant one when it acts as employer.\u201dWaters,supra, at 675 (plurality opinion). Given\nthe \u201ccommon-sense realization that government offices could not\nfunction if every employment decision became a constitutional\nmatter,\u201dConnick,supra, at 143, \u201cconstitutional\nreview of government employment decisions must rest on different\nprinciples than review of \u2026 restraints imposed by the government as\nsovereign,\u201dWaters,supra, at 674 (plurality\nopinion).In light of these basic\nprinciples, we have often recognized that government has\nsignificantly greater leeway in its dealings with citizen employees\nthan it does when it brings its sovereign power to bear on citizens\nat large. Thus, for example, we have held that the Fourth Amendment\ndoes not require public employers to obtain warrants before\nconducting a search of an employee\u2019s office.O\u2019Connorv.Ortega,480\nU. S. 709, 721\u2013722 (1987) (plurality opinion). See alsoid., at 732 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment). Although\nwe recognized that the \u201clegitimate privacy interests of public\nemployees in the private objects they bring to the workplace may be\nsubstantial,\u201d we found that \u201c[a]gainst these privacy interests \u2026\nmust be balanced the realities of the workplace, which strongly\nsuggest that a warrant requirement would be unworkable.\u201dId.,at 721 (plurality opinion). We have also found that\nthe Due Process Clause does not protect a public employee from\ndischarge, even when such discharge was mistaken or unreasonable.\nSeeBishopv.Wood,426 U. S. 341, 350 (1976) (\u201cThe Due\nProcess Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is not a guarantee\nagainst incorrect or ill-advised personnel decisions\u201d).Our public-employee speech cases are\nparticularly instructive. InPickeringv.Board of Ed.\nof Township High School Dist. 205, Will Cty.,391 U. S. 563, 568\n(1968), we explained that, in analyzing a claim that a public\nemployee was deprived of First Amendment rights by her employer, we\nmust seek \u201ca balance between the interests of the [employee], as a\ncitizen, in commenting upon matters of public concern and the\ninterest of the State, as an employer, in promoting the efficiency\nof the public services it performs through its employees.\u201dWe analyzed the contours of this balance more\nfully inConnickv.Myers,supra.We\nexplained that the First Amendment protects public-employee speech\nonly when it falls within the core of First Amendment\nprotection\u2014speech on matters of public concern. We recognized that\nthe \u201c\u00a0\u2018First Amendment does not protect speech and assembly\nonly to the extent it can be characterized as political,\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nand that the government therefore could not generally prohibit or\npunish, in its capacity as sovereign, speech on the ground that it\ndoes not touch upon matters of public concern,id., at 147(quotingMine Workersv.Illinois Bar\nAssn.,389 U.\nS. 217, 223 (1967)). But \u201c[w]hen employee expression cannot be\nfairly considered as relating to any matter of political, social,\nor other concern to the community, government officials should\nenjoy wide latitude in managing their offices.\u201dConnick,\n461 U. S., at 146. As we explained, \u201cabsent the most unusual\ncircumstances, a federal court is not the appropriate forum in\nwhich to review the wisdom of a personnel decision taken by a\npublic agency allegedly in reaction to the employee\u2019s behavior.\u201dId., at 147 (citingBishop,supra,at\n349\u2013350).Our precedent in the public-employee context\ntherefore establishes two main principles: First, although\ngovernment employees do not lose their constitutional rights when\nthey accept their positions, those rights must be balanced against\nthe realities of the employment context. Second, in striking the\nappropriate balance, we consider whether the asserted employee\nright implicates the basic concerns of the relevant constitutional\nprovision, or whether the claimed right can more readily give way\nto the requirements of the government as employer. With these\nprinciples in mind, we come to the question whether a class-of-one\ntheory of equal protection is cognizable in the public employment\ncontext.BOur equal protection\njurisprudence has typically been concerned with governmental\nclassifications that \u201caffect some groups of citizens differently\nthan others.\u201dMcGowanv.Maryland,366 U. S. 420, 425\n(1961). See,e.g., Rossv.Moffitt,417 U. S. 600, 609\n(1974) (\u201c\u00a0\u2018Equal Protection\u2019 \u2026 emphasizes disparity in\ntreatment by a State between classes of individuals whose\nsituations are arguably indistinguishable\u201d);San Antonio\nIndependent School Dist.v.Rodriguez,411 U. S. 1, 60 (1973)\n(Stewart, J., concurring) (\u201c[T]he basic concern of the Equal\nProtection Clause is with state legislation whose purpose or effect\nis to create discrete and objectively identifiable classes\u201d).\nPlaintiffs in such cases generally allege that they have been\narbitrarily classified as members of an \u201cidentifiable group.\u201dPersonnel Administrator of Mass.v.Feeney,442 U. S. 256,\n279 (1979).Engquist correctly argues,\nhowever, that we recognized inOlechthat an equal\nprotection claim can in some circumstances be sustained even if the\nplaintiff has not alleged class-based discrimination, but instead\nclaims that she has been irrationally singled out as a so-called\n\u201cclass of one.\u201d InOlech, a property owner had asked the\nvillage of Willowbrook to connect her property to the municipal\nwater supply. Although the village had required only a 15-foot\neasement from other property owners seeking access to the water\nsupply, the village conditioned Olech\u2019s connection on a grant of a\n33-foot easement. Olech sued the village, claiming that the\nvillage\u2019s requirement of an easement 18 feet longer than the norm\nviolated the Equal Protection Clause. Although Olech had not\nalleged that the village had discriminated against her based on\nmembership in an identifiable class, we held that her complaint\nstated a valid claim under the Equal Protection Clause because it\nalleged that she had \u201cbeen intentionally treated differently from\nothers similarly situated and that there is no rational basis for\nthe difference in treatment.\u201d 528 U. S., at 564 (citingSioux\nCity Bridge Co.v.Dakota County,260 U. S. 441(1923),\nandAllegheny Pittsburgh Coal Co.v.Commission of\nWebster Cty.,488 U. S. 336(1989)).Recognition of the class-of-one theory of\nequal protection on the facts inOlechwas not so much a\ndeparture from the principle that the Equal Protection Clause is\nconcerned with arbitrary government classification, as it was an\napplication of that principle. That case involved the government\u2019s\nregulation of property. Similarly, the cases upon which the Court\ninOlechrelied concerned property assessment and taxation\nschemes. SeeAllegheny Pittsburgh, supra;Sioux City\nBridge, supra.We expect such legislative or regulatory\nclassifications to apply \u201cwithout respect to persons,\u201d to borrow a\nphrase from the judicial oath. See 28 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7453. As we\nexplained long ago, the Fourteenth Amendment \u201crequires that all\npersons subjected to \u2026 legislation shall be treated alike, under\nlike circumstances and conditions, both in the privileges conferred\nand in the liabilities imposed.\u201dHayesv.Missouri,120 U. S. 68, 71\u201372\n(1887). When those who appear similarly situated are nevertheless\ntreated differently, the Equal Protection Clause requires at least\na rational reason for the difference, to assure that all persons\nsubject to legislation or regulation are indeed being \u201ctreated\nalike, under like circumstances and conditions.\u201d Thus, when it\nappears that an individual is being singled out by the government,\nthe specter of arbitrary classification is fairly raised, and the\nEqual Protection Clause requires a \u201crational basis for the\ndifference in treatment.\u201dOlech, 528 U. S., at 564.What seems to have been significant inOlechand the cases on which it relied was the existence\nof a clear standard against which departures, even for a single\nplaintiff, could be readily assessed. There was no indication inOlechthat the zoning board was exercising discretionary\nauthority based on subjective, individualized determinations\u2014at\nleast not with regard to easement length, however typical such\ndeterminations may be as a general zoning matter. Seeid.,at 565 (Breyer, J., concurring in result). Rather, the complaint\nalleged that the board consistently required only a 15-foot\neasement, but subjected Olech to a 33-foot easement. This\ndifferential treatment raised a concern of arbitrary\nclassification, and we therefore required that the State provide a\nrational basis for it.InAllegheny Pittsburgh, cited by theOlechCourt, the applicable standard was market value, but\nthe county departed from that standard in basing some assessments\non quite dated purchase prices. Again, there was no suggestion that\nthe \u201cdramatic differences in valuation\u201d for similar property\nparcels, 488 U. S., at 341, were based on subjective considerations\nof the sort on which appraisers often rely, seeid., at\n338\u2013342, 345.Sioux City Bridge, also cited inOlech, was the same sort of case, recognizing an equal\nprotection claim when one taxpayer\u2019s property was assessed at 100\npercent of its value, while all other property was assessed at 55\npercent, without regard to articulated differences in the\nproperties. See 260 U. S., at 445\u2013447.There are some forms of state action, however,\nwhich by their nature involve discretionary decisionmaking based on\na vast array of subjective, individualized assessments. In such\ncases the rule that people should be \u201ctreated alike, under like\ncircumstances and conditions\u201d is not violated when one person is\ntreated differently from others, because treating like individuals\ndifferently is an accepted consequence of the discretion granted.\nIn such situations, allowing a challenge based on the arbitrary\nsingling out of a particular person would undermine the very\ndiscretion that such state officials are entrusted to exercise.Suppose, for example, that a traffic officer\nis stationed on a busy highway where people often drive above the\nspeed limit, and there is no basis upon which to distinguish them.\nIf the officer gives only one of those people a ticket, it may be\ngood English to say that the officer has created a class of people\nthat did not get speeding tickets, and a \u201cclass of one\u201d that did.\nBut assuming that it is in the nature of the particular government\nactivity that not all speeders can be stopped and ticketed,\ncomplaining that one has been singled out for no reason does not\ninvoke the fear of improper government classification. Such a\ncomplaint, rather, challenges the legitimacy of the underlying\naction itself\u2014the decision to ticket speeders under such\ncircumstances. Of course, an allegation that speeding tickets are\ngiven out on the basis of race or sex would state an equal\nprotection claim, because such discriminatory classifications\nimplicate basic equal protection concerns. But allowing an equal\nprotection claim on the ground that a ticket was given to one\nperson and not others, even if for no discernible or articulable\nreason, would be incompatible with the discretion inherent in the\nchallenged action. It is no proper challenge to what in its nature\nis a subjective, individualized decision that it was subjective and\nindividualized.This principle applies most clearly in the\nemployment context, for employment decisions are quite often\nsubjective and individualized, resting on a wide array of factors\nthat are difficult to articulate and quantify. As Engquist herself\npoints out, \u201c[u]nlike the zoning official, the public employer\noften must take into account the individual personalities and\ninterpersonal relationships of employees in the workplace. The\nclose relationship between the employer and employee, and the\nvaried needs and interests involved in the employment context, mean\nthat considerations such as concerns over personality conflicts\nthat would be unreasonable as grounds for \u2018arm\u2019s-length\u2019 government\ndecisions (e.g., zoning, licensing) may well justify\ndifferent treatment of a public employee.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 48.\nUnlike the context of arm\u2019s-length regulation, such as inOlech, treating seemingly similarly situated individuals\ndifferently in the employment context is par for the course.Thus, the class-of-one theory of equal\nprotection\u2014which presupposes that like individuals should be\ntreated alike, and that to treat them differently is to classify\nthem in a way that must survive at least rationality review\u2014is\nsimply a poor fit in the public employment context. To treat\nemployees differently is not to classify them in a way that raises\nequal protection concerns. Rather, it is simply to exercise the\nbroad discretion that typically characterizes the employer-employee\nrelationship. A challenge that one has been treated individually in\nthis context, instead of like everyone else, is a challenge to the\nunderlying nature of the government action.Of course, that is not to say that the Equal\nProtection Clause, like other constitutional provisions, does not\napply to public employers. Indeed, our cases make clear that the\nEqual Protection Clause is implicated when the government makes\nclass-based decisions in the employment context, treating distinct\ngroups of individuals categorically differently. See,e.g.,Beazer, 440 U. S., at 593 (upholding city\u2019s\nexclusion of methadone users from employment under rational-basis\nreview);Martin, 440 U. S., at 199\u2013201 (classification\nbetween teachers who had complied with a continuing-education\nrequirement and those who had not is rational and does not violate\nthe Equal Protection Clause);Murgia, 427 U. S., at\n314\u2013317 (upholding a mandatory retirement age\u2014a classification\nbased on age\u2014under rational-basis review). The dissent\u2019s broad\nstatement that we \u201cexcep[t] state employees from the Fourteenth\nAmendment\u2019s protection against unequal and irrational treatment at\nthe hands of the State,\u201dpost, at 2 (opinion of Stevens,\nJ.), is thus plainly not correct. But we have never found the Equal\nProtection Clause implicated in the specific circumstance where, as\nhere, government employers are alleged to have made an\nindividualized, subjective personnel decision in a seemingly\narbitrary or irrational manner.This is not surprising, given the historical\nunderstanding of the nature of government employment. We long ago\nrecognized the \u201csettled principle that government employment, in\nthe absence of legislation, can be revoked at the will of the\nappointing officer.\u201dMcElroy, 367 U. S., at 896. The basic\nprinciple of at-will employment is that an employee may be\nterminated for a \u201c\u00a0\u2018good reason, bad reason, or no reason at\nall.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Reply Brief for Petitioner 27. SeeAndrewsv.Louisville & Nashville R. Co.,406 U. S. 320, 324\n(1972) (\u201c[T]he very concept of \u2018wrongful discharge\u2019 implies some\nsort of statutory or contractual standard that modifies the\ntraditional common-law rule that a contract of employment is\nterminable by either party at will\u201d). Thus, \u201c[w]e have never held\nthat it is a violation of the Constitution for a government\nemployer to discharge an employee based on substantively incorrect\ninformation.\u201dWaters, 511 U. S., at 679 (plurality\nopinion). See alsoConnick, 461 U. S., at 146\u2013147\n(\u201c[O]rdinary dismissals from government service \u2026 are not subject\nto judicial review even if the reasons for the dismissal are\nalleged to be mistaken or unreasonable\u201d (citingBoard of\nRegents of State Collegesv.Roth,408 U. S. 564(1972);Perryv.Sindermann,408 U. S. 593(1972);\nandBishop,426 U. S. 341)). \u201cAnd an at-will\ngovernment employee \u2026 generally has no claim based on the\nConstitution at all.\u201dWaters,supra, at 679\n(plurality opinion). See,e.g.,Bishop,supra, at 349\u2013350.State employers cannot, of course, take\npersonnel actions that would independently violate the\nConstitution. Seesupra, at 5\u20138. But recognition of a\nclass-of-one theory of equal protection in the public employment\ncontext\u2014that is, a claim that the State treated an employee\ndifferently from others for a bad reason, or for no reason at\nall\u2014is simply contrary to the concept of at-will employment. The\nConstitution does not require repudiating that familiar\ndoctrine.To be sure, Congress and all the States have,\nfor the most part, replaced at-will employment with various\nstatutory schemes protecting public employees from discharge for\nimpermissible reasons. See,e.g.,5 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a72302(b)(10) (2006 ed.) (supervisor of covered federal employee may\nnot \u201cdiscriminate \u2026 on the basis of conduct which does not\nadversely affect the performance of the employee or applicant or\nthe performance of others\u201d).

But a government\u2019s decision to limit\nthe ability of public employers to fire at will is an act of\nlegislative grace, not constitutional mandate.Indeed, recognizing the sort of claim Engquist\npresses could jeopardize the delicate balance governments have\nstruck between the rights of public employees and \u201cthe government\u2019s\nlegitimate purpose in \u2018promot[ing] efficiency and integrity in the\ndischarge of official duties, and [in] maintain[ing] proper\ndiscipline in the public service.\u2019\u00a0\u201dConnick,supra,at 151 (quotingEx parte Curtis, 106 U.\nS., at 373; alterations in original). Thus, for example, although\nmost federal employees are covered by the Civil Service Reform Act\nof 1978, Pub. L. 95\u2013454, Congress has specifically excluded some\ngroups of employees from its protection, see,e.g.,5 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a72302(a)(2)(C) (2006 ed.) (excluding from coverage,inter alia, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the\nCentral Intelligence Agency, and the Defense Intelligence Agency).\nWere we to find that the Equal Protection Clause subjects the\nGovernment to equal protection review for every allegedly arbitrary\nemployment action, we will have undone Congress\u2019s (and the States\u2019)\ncareful work.In concluding that the class-of-one theory of\nequal protection has no application in the public employment\ncontext\u2014and that is all we decide\u2014we are guided, as in the past, by\nthe \u201ccommon-sense realization that government offices could not\nfunction if every employment decision became a constitutional\nmatter.\u201dConnick,supra,at 143. If, as Engquist\nsuggests, plaintiffs need not claim discrimination on the basis of\nmembership in some class or group, but rather may argue only that\nthey were treated by their employers worse than other employees\nsimilarly situated, any personnel action in which a wronged\nemployee can conjure up a claim of differential treatment will\nsuddenly become the basis for a federal constitutional claim.\nIndeed, an allegation of arbitrary differential treatment could be\nmade in nearly every instance of an assertedly wrongful employment\naction\u2014not only hiring and firing decisions, but any personnel\naction, such as promotion, salary, or work assignments\u2014on the\ntheory that other employees were not treated wrongfully. See 478\nF.\u00a03d, at 995. On Engquist\u2019s view, every one of these\nemployment decisions by a government employer would become the\nbasis for an equal protection complaint.Engquist assures us that accepting her view\nwould not pose too much of a practical problem. Specifically,\nEngquist argues that a plaintiff in a class-of-one employment case\nwould have to prove that the government\u2019s differential treatment\nwas intentional, that the plaintiff was treated differently from\nother similarly situated persons, and that the unequal treatment\nwas not rationally related to a legitimate government purpose.\nBrief for Petitioner 36\u201339. And because a \u201cgovernmental employment\ndecision is \u2026 rational whenever the discrimination relates to a\nlegitimate government interest,\u201d it is in practice \u201cdifficult for\nplaintiffs to show that the government has failed to meet this\nstandard.\u201dId., at 41. Justice Stevens makes a similar\nargument, stating \u201cthat all but a handful [of class-of-one\ncomplaints] are dismissed well in advance of trial.\u201dPost,\nat 7.We agree that, even if we accepted Engquist\u2019s\nclaim, it would be difficult for a plaintiff to show that an\nemployment decision is arbitrary. But this submission is beside the\npoint. The practical problem with allowing class-of-one claims to\ngo forward in this context is not that it will be too easy for\nplaintiffs to prevail, but that governments will be forced to\ndefend a multitude of such claims in the first place, and courts\nwill be obliged to sort through them in a search for the proverbial\nneedle in a haystack. The Equal Protection Clause does not require\n\u201c[t]his displacement of managerial discretion by judicial\nsupervision.\u201dGarcettiv.Ceballos,547 U. S. 410, 423\n(2006).In short, ratifying a class-of-one theory of\nequal protection in the context of public employment would\nimpermissibly \u201cconstitutionalize the employee grievance.\u201dConnick, 461 U. S., at 154. \u201cThe federal court is not the\nappropriate forum in which to review the multitude of personnel\ndecisions that are made daily by public agencies.\u201dBishop,supra,at 349. Public employees typically have a variety\nof protections from just the sort of personnel actions about which\nEngquist complains, but the Equal Protection Clause is not one of\nthem.The judgment of the Court of Appeals is\naffirmed.It is so ordered.",
