I write separately to make two observations.First, the Court does not foreclose \u00a7633a claims\narising from discriminatory processes. Cf.Comcast Corp.v.National Assn. of African American-Owned Media,ante,\np.\u00a0___ (Ginsburg, J.,\u00a0concurring in part and concurring\nin judgment). If, for example, an employer hires a 50-year-old\nperson who passed a computer-aptitude test administered only to\napplicants above 40, clearly a question could arise as to whether\nthe hiring decision was \u201cmade free from\u201d differential\ntreatment.Second, this same example may suggest that \u00a7633a\npermits damages remedies, even when the Government engages in\nnondispositive \u201cage discrimination in the \u2018ma[king]\u2019 of a personnel\ndecision.\u201dAnte, at 10. If an applicant incurs costs to\nprepare for the discriminatorily administered aptitude test, a\ndamages award compensating for such out-of-pocket expenses could\nrestore the applicant to the \u201cposition tha[t] he or she would have\nenjoyed absent discrimination.\u201dAnte, at 14.",
