L. C.,\net\u00a0al.on writs of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the fifth circuit[June 29, 2020]Justice Alito, with whom Justice Gorsuch\njoins, with whom Justice Thomas joins except as to Parts III\u2013C and\nIV\u2013F, and with whom Justice Kavanaugh joins as to Parts I, II, and\nIII, dissenting.The majority bills today\u2019s decision as a\nfacsimile ofWhole Woman\u2019s Healthv.Hellerstedt, 579\nU.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2016), and it\u2019s true they have something in\ncommon. In both, the abortion right recognized in this Court\u2019s\ndecisions is used like a bulldozer to flatten legal rules that\nstand in the way.InWhole Woman\u2019s Health, res judicata and\nour standard approach to severability were laid low. EvenPlanned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa.v.Casey,505 U.S.\n833(1992), was altered.Today\u2019s decision claims new victims. The divided\nmajority cannot agree on what the abortion right requires, but it\nnevertheless strikes down a Louisiana law, Act 620, that the\nlegislature enacted for the asserted purpose of protecting women\u2019s\nhealth. To achieve this end, the majority misuses the doctrine ofstare decisis, invokes an inapplicable standard of appellate\nreview, and distorts the record.The plurality eschews the constitutional test\nset out inCaseyand instead employs the balancing test\nadopted inWhole Woman\u2019s Health.The plurality concludes\nthat the Louisiana law does nothing to protect the health of women,\nbut that is disproved by substantial evidence in the record. And\nthe plurality upholds the District Court\u2019s finding that the\nLouisiana law would cause a drastic reduction in the number of\nabortion providers in the State even though this finding was based\non an erroneous legal standard and a thoroughly inadequate factual\ninquiry.The Chief Justice stresses the importance ofstare decisisand thinks that precedent, namelyWhole\nWoman\u2019s Health,dooms the Louisiana law. But at the same time,\nhe votes to overruleWhole Woman\u2019sHealthinsofar as\nit changed theCaseytest.Both the plurality and The Chief Justice hold\nthat abortion providers can invoke a woman\u2019s abortion right when\nthey attack state laws that are enacted to protect a woman\u2019s\nhealth. Neither waiver norstare decisiscan justify this\nholding, which clashes with our general rule on third-party\nstanding. And the idea that a regulated party can invoke the right\nof a third party for the purpose of attacking legislation enacted\nto protect the third party is stunning. Given the apparent conflict\nof interest, that concept would be rejected out of hand in a case\nnot involving abortion.For these reasons, I cannot join the decision of\nthe Court. I would remand the case to the District Court and\ninstruct that court, before proceeding any further, to require the\njoinder of a plaintiff with standing. If a proper plaintiff is\nadded, the District Court should conduct a new trial and determine,\nbased on proper evidence, whether enforcement of Act 620 would\ndiminish the number of abortion providers in the State to such a\ndegree that women\u2019s access to abortions would be substantially\nimpaired. In making that determination, the court should jettison\nthe nebulous \u201cgood faith\u201d test that it used in judging whether the\nphysicians who currently lack admitting privileges would be able to\nobtain privileges and thus continue to perform abortions if Act 620\nwere permitted to take effect. Because the doctors in question\n(many of whom are or were plaintiffs in this case) stand to lose,\nnot gain, by obtaining privileges, the court should require the\nplaintiffs to show that these doctors sought admitting privileges\nwith the degree of effort that they would expend if their personal\ninterests were at stake.IUnder our precedent, the critical question in\nthis case is whether the challenged Louisiana law places a\n\u201csubstantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion of\na nonviable fetus.\u201dCasey, 505 U.\u00a0S., at 877 (plurality\nopinion). If a law like that at issue here does not have that\neffect, it is constitutional.Id., at 884 (joint opinion of\nO\u2019Connor, Kennedy, and Souter, JJ.).The petitioners urge us to adopt a rule that is\nmore favorable to abortion providers. At oral argument, their\nattorney maintained that a law that has no effect on women\u2019s access\nto abortion is nevertheless unconstitutional if it is not needed to\nprotect women\u2019s health. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 18\u201319. Of course, that\nis precisely the argument one would expect from a business that\nwishes to be free from burdensome regulations. But unless an\nabortion law has an adverse effecton women, there is no\nreason why the law should face greater constitutional scrutiny than\nany other measure that burdens a regulated entity in the name of\nhealth or safety. SeeCasey, 505 U.\u00a0S., at 884\u2013885\n(joint opinion). Many state and local laws that are justified as\nsafety measures rest on debatable empirical grounds. But when a\nparty saddled with such restrictions challenges them as a violation\nof due process, our cases call for the restrictions to be sustained\nif \u201cit might be thought that the particular legislative measure was\na rational way\u201d to serve a valid interest. SeeWilliamsonv.Lee Optical of Okla., Inc.,348 U.S.\n483, 488 (1955). The test that petitioners advocate would give\nabortion providers an unjustifiable advantage over all other\nregulated parties, and for that reason, it was rejected inCasey. See 505 U.\u00a0S., at 851 (majority opinion).Caseyalso rules out the balancing test\nadopted inWhole Woman\u2019s Health. Whole Woman\u2019s Healthsimply\nmisinterpretedCasey,and I agree thatWhole Woman\u2019s\nHealthshould be overruled insofar as it changed theCaseytest. UnlessCaseyis reexamined\u2014and Louisiana\nhas not asked us to do that\u2014the test it adopted should remain the\ngoverning standard.IIBecause the plurality adheres to the balancing\ntest adopted inWhole Woman\u2019s Health, it considers whether\nthe Louisiana law helps to protect the health of women seeking\nabortions, and it concludes that \u201cnothing in the record indicates\nthat the background vetting for admitting privileges adds\nsignificantly to the vetting that the State Board of Medical\nExaminers already provides.\u201dAnte, at 37. The Chief Justice\nseems to agree,ante, at 14\u201315 (opinion concurring in\njudgment), although it is unclear why this issue matters under the\ntest he favors.In any event, contrary to the view taken by the\nplurality and (seemingly) by The Chief Justice, there is ample\nevidence in the record showing that admitting privileges help to\nprotect the health of women by ensuring that physicians who perform\nabortions meet a higher standard of competence than is shown by the\nmere possession of a license to practice. In deciding whether to\ngrant admitting privileges, hospitals typically undertake a\nrigorous investigative process to ensure that a doctor is\nresponsible and competent and has the training and experience\nneeded to perform the procedures for which the privileges are\nsought. As the Fifth Circuit explained, \u201chospitals verify an\napplicant\u2019s surgical ability, training, education, experience,\npractice record, and criminal history. These factors are reviewed\nby a board of multiple physicians.\u201dJune Medical Services, L. L.\nC.v.Gee, 905 F.3d 787, 805, n.\u00a053 (2018).The standards used by the great majority of\nhospitals in deciding whether to grant privileges clearly show that\nhospitals demand proof of a higher level of competence. The Joint\nCommission, a nonprofit organization that accredits healthcare\ninstitutions, has issued standards for granting admitting\nprivileges, and all of the hospitals whose rules are relevant here\n(and the vast majority of Louisiana hospitals) comply with those\nstandards.[1] These standards\ncall for an examination of each applicant\u2019s licensure, education,\ntraining, and current competence. See Joint Commission, 2020\nHospital Accreditation Standards, pp.\u00a0MS\u201323, 25, 26, 29. They\nrequire an examination of a doctor\u2019s health records, clinical data\non performance, and peer recommendations, and they demand that a\nhospital make a careful assessment of the procedures a physician\nmay perform.Ibid.Dr. Robert Marier, the former director of the\nLouisiana Board of Medical Examiners (and the former dean of\nLouisiana State University Medical School), testified that the\nprocess conducted by hospitals in deciding whether to grant\nadmitting privileges is \u201cthe primary way of determining\ncompetency.\u201d App. 818. That process, he explained, \u201cthoroughly\nvet[s] the qualifications of [applicants] to ensure that [they] are\ncompetent to provide the services that are in question.\u201dIbid.June Medical\u2019s expert, Dr. Eva Pressman, agreed\nthat \u201cadmitting privileges can serve the function of providing an\nevaluation mechanism for physician competency.\u201dId., at\n1042, 1091; Record 10864. Doe 3, one of the doctors who currently\nperforms abortions in Louisiana, also acknowledged the\ncredentialing value of admitting privileges, App. 247\u2013248, as did\nDoe 4, another Louisiana abortion doctor, Record 14155.Although the plurality contends that the review\nconducted by hospitals adds little to the vetting undertaken by the\nState Board of Medical Examiners (Board), that is not true.\nHospitals look beyond the mere possession of a license, and they do\nthat for very obvious reasons. If nothing else, their review\nprocess serves the hospitals\u2019 interests by diminishing the risk of\nawards for malpractice committed by doctors practicing on their\npremises. In Louisiana, hospitals that perform negligent\ncredentialing cannot benefit from the State\u2019s medical malpractice\ncap. SeeBilleaudeauv.Opelousas General Hospital\nAuth., 2016\u20130846, p.\u00a021 (La. 10/19/16), 218 So. 3d 513,\n527. In addition, a hospital\u2019s \u201cMedicare participation and other\ncertifications depend on completing the credentialing\nprocess.\u201d[2]The review conducted by hospitals goes beyond\nthat of the Board in another way: it is continuous. Under the Joint\nCommission Standards, hospitals must monitor physicians with\nadmitting privileges and can therefore make a running assessment of\ntheir competence. See Record 11850. The Board, on the other hand,\nconducts an inquiry before initially issuing a license, but the\nannual license renewal process entails nothing more than completing\na standard form, paying the required fee, and documenting a certain\nnumber of continuing medical education credits. See 46 La. Admin.\nCode, pt. XLV, \u00a7417 (2020).Because hospitals continue to evaluate doctors\nafter privileges are granted, they may discover information that\nassists the Board in carrying out its responsibilities. In the\npast, hospitals have forwarded such information to the Board, and\nsuch referrals have led the Board to take serious disciplinary\nactions.[3]The record shows that the vetting conducted by\nhospitals goes far beyond what is done at Louisiana abortion\nclinics. Some clinics demand nothing more than possession of a\nlicense. Take the example of petitioner June Medical. Doe 3, the\nonly person at that clinic who evaluates applicants, testified that\nhe does not perform background checks of any kind, not even\ncriminal records checks. App. 249\u2013250. In the past, Doe 3 hired a\nradiologist and ophthalmologist to perform abortions.Id.,\nat 249.Delta Clinic in Baton Rouge and Women\u2019s Clinic\nin New Orleans have similarly lax practices. Leroy Brinkley, the\npresident of both clinics, testified before a Pennsylvania grand\njury that, in making hiring decisions, \u201c\u00a0\u2018I don\u2019t judge the\nlicense. If they have a license and the state gave the license,\nit\u2019s not for me to determine if they are capable.\u2019\u00a0\u201d[4] A \u201c\u00a0\u2018background check,\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nhe said, is not within his \u201c\u00a0\u2018framework.\u2019\u00a0\u201d[5]Doe 4, who practiced at the now-defunct Causeway\nClinic near New Orleans, recounted the meager vetting that occurred\nwhen he was hired at that facility. He had to produce a valid\nmedical license and DEA license but was not required \u201cto undergo\nanything similar to review by a credentials committee.\u201d Record\n14156.In light of these practices, it is no surprise\nthat the Louisiana Department of Health has issued Statements of\nDeficiency against abortion facilities for failing to adopt\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018a detailed credentialing process for physicians,\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nfailing to investigate \u201c\u00a0\u2018possible restrictions\u2019\u00a0\u201d on\nphysicians\u2019 licenses, and failing to look into \u201c\u00a0\u2018evidence of\nprior malpractice claims/settlements.\u2019\u00a0\u201d[6]Louisiana adopted Act 620 in the aftermath of\nthe Kermit Gosnell grand jury report, which expounded on the\nfailures of regulatory oversight that allowed Gosnell\u2019s practices\nto continue for an extended period. See Report of Grand Jury in No.\n0009901\u20132008 (1st Jud. Dist. Pa., Jan. 14, 2011). The grand jury\nconcluded that closer supervision would have uncovered Gosnell\u2019s\negregious health and safety violations. Gosnell had a medical\nlicense, but it is doubtful that any hospital would have given him\nadmitting privileges.In sum, contrary to the plurality\u2019s assertion,\nthere is ample evidence in the record showing that requiring\nadmitting privileges has health and safety benefits. There is\ncertainly room for debate about the need for this requirement, but\nunder our case law, this Court\u2019s task is not to ascertain whether a\nlaw \u201cadds significantly\u201d to the existing regulatory framework.\nInstead, when confronted with a genuine dispute about a law\u2019s\nbenefits, we have afforded legislatures \u201cwide discretion\u201d in\nassessing whether a regulation serves a legitimate medical need and\nis medically reasonable even in the face of medical and scientific\nuncertainty.Gonzalesv.Carhart,550 U.S.\n124, 163 (2007);Mazurekv.Armstrong,520 U.S.\n968, 973 (1997) (per\u00a0curiam);Akronv.Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc.,462 U.S.\n416, 458 (1983) (O\u2019Connor, J., dissenting) (\u201c[L]egislatures are\nbetter suited\u201d than courts \u201cto make the necessary factual judgments\nin this area\u201d); accord,Barskyv.Board of Regents of\nUniv. of N.\u00a0Y.,347 U.S.\n442, 451 (1954) (State has \u201clegitimate concern for maintaining\nhigh standards of professional conduct\u201d in the practice of\nmedicine). Louisiana easily satisfied this standard.For these reasons, both the plurality and The\nChief Justice err in concluding that the admitting-privileges\nrequirement serves no valid purpose.IIIThey also err in their assessment of Act 620\u2019s\nlikely effect on access to abortion. They misuse the doctrine ofstare decisisand the standard of appellate review for\nfindings of fact.AStare decisisis a major theme in the\nplurality opinion and that of The Chief Justice. Both opinions try\nto create the impression that this case is the same asWhole\nWoman\u2019s Healthand thatstare decisistherefore commands\nthe same result. In truth, however, the two cases are very\ndifferent. While it is certainly true that the Texas and Louisianastatutesare largely the same, the two cases are not. The\ndecision inWhole Woman\u2019s Healthwas not based on the face\nof the Texas statute, but on an empirical question, namely, the\neffect of the statute on access to abortion in that State. 579\nU.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 24). The Court\u2019s answer to that\nquestion depended on numerous factors that may differ from State to\nState, including the demand for abortions, the number and location\nof abortion clinics and physicians, the geography of the State, the\ndistribution of the population, and the ability of physicians to\nobtain admitting privileges.Id., at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at\n24\u201326). There is no reason to think that a law requiring admitting\nprivileges will necessarily have the same effect in every state. As\na result, just because the Texas admitting privileges requirement\nwas found by this Court, based on evidence in the record of that\ncase, to have substantially reduced access to abortion in that\nState, it does not follow that Act 620 would have comparable\neffects in Louisiana. Seeid., at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at\n22\u201326) (reviewing Texas record). The two States are neighbors, but\nthey are not the same. Accordingly, the record-based empirical\ndetermination inWhole Woman\u2019s Healthis not controlling\nhere.The suggestion thatWhole Woman\u2019s Healthis materially identical to this case is ironic, since the two cases\ndiffer in a way that was critical to the Court\u2019s reasoning inWhole Woman\u2019s Health, i.e.,the difference between a\npre-enforcement facial challenge and a post-enforcement challenge\nbased on evidence of the law\u2019s effects. Seeid., at ___\n(slip op., at 11). Before the Texas law went into effect, abortion\nproviders mounted an unsuccessful facial challenge, arguing that\nthe law would drastically limit abortion access. The Fifth Circuit\nheld that the plaintiffs had not shown that the law would create a\nsubstantial obstacle for women seeking abortions, and a final\njudgment was entered against them.Planned Parenthood of Greater\nTex. Surgical Health Servs. v.Abbott, 748 F.3d 583,\n590, 605 (2014). Then, after the law had been in operation for some\ntime, many of the same plaintiffs filed a second suit and again\nargued that the admitting privileges requirement violatedCasey.Whole Woman\u2019s Healthv.Cole, 790 F.3d\n563, 577, and n.\u00a014 (CA5 2015). The State defendants sought\ndismissal based on the doctrine of claim preclusion, but theWhole Woman\u2019s Healthmajority rejected that argument. 579\nU.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 11).Why? Two words: \u201cchanged circumstances.\u201dId., at ___ (slip op., at 13). According to the Court, the\npre-enforcement facial challenge was not the same \u201cclaim\u201d as the\npost-enforcement claim because the \u201cpostenforcement consequences\u201d\nof the challenged Texas law were \u201cunknowablebefore [the\nlaw] went into effect.\u201dId., at ___ (slip op., at 14)\n(emphasis added); see alsoibid.(\u201c[I]t was still unclear\nhow many clinics would be affected\u201d);id., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 12) (discussing \u201cnew material facts\u201d);id., at ___ (slip\nop., at 14) (recounting \u201clater, concrete factual\ndevelopments\u201d).The present case is in the same posture as the\npre-enforcement facial challenge to the Texas law, and it should\ntherefore be obvious that this Court\u2019s decision inWhole Woman\u2019s\nHealthis not controlling.B1Aside from suggesting thatWhole Woman\u2019s\nHealthis dispositive, the plurality and The Chief Justice\nprovide one other reason for concluding that Act 620, if allowed to\ngo into effect, would create a substantial obstacle for women\nseeking abortions. Pointing to the District Court\u2019s finding that\nthe Louisiana law would have a drastic effect on abortion access,June Medical Services, LLCv.Kliebert, 250\nF.\u00a0Supp. 3d 27, 87 (MD La. 2017), the plurality and The Chief\nJustice note that findings of fact may be overturned only if\nclearly erroneous, and they see no such error here.Ante, at\n17 (opinion of Breyer, J.);ante, at 15\u201316 (opinion of\nRoberts, C. J.). In taking this approach, they overlook the flawed\nlegal standard on which the District Court\u2019s finding depends, and\nthey ignore the gross deficiencies of the evidence in the\nrecord.Because the Louisiana law was not allowed to go\ninto effect for any appreciable time, it was necessary for the\nDistrict Court to predict what its effects would be. Attempting to\ndo that, the court apparently concluded that none of the doctors\nwho currently perform abortions in the State would be replaced if\nthe admitting privileges requirement forced them to leave abortion\npractice. 250 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at 82. That inference is debatable,\nas it primarily rests on the anecdotal testimony of June Medical\u2019s\nadministrator. Seeid., at 81\u201382; App. 113\u2013114. Neither the\nplurality nor The Chief Justice explains why it should be accepted.\nThat alone casts doubt on the finding to which the majority defers,\nbut the problems with the finding do not stop there.The finding was based on a fundamentally flawed\ntest. In attempting to ascertain how many of the doctors who\nperform abortions in the State would have to leave abortion\npractice for lack of admitting privileges, the District Court\nreceived evidence in a variety of forms\u2014some live testimony, but\nalso deposition transcripts, declarations, and even letters from\ncounsel\u2014about the doctors\u2019 unsuccessful efforts to obtain\nprivileges. The District Court considered whether these doctors had\nproceeded in \u201cgood faith\u201d; it found that they all met that\nstandard; and it therefore concluded that the law would leave the\nState with very few abortion providers.2Under the reasoning just described, the\nfactual finding on which the plurality and The Chief Justice\nrely\u2014that the Louisiana law would drastically reduce access to\nabortion in the State\u2014depends on the District Court\u2019s finding that\nthe doctors in question exercised \u201cgood faith\u201d in their quest for\nprivileges, but that test is woefully deficient.It has aptly been said that \u201cgood faith\u201d\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018is an elusive idea, taking on different meanings and\nemphases as we move from one context to another.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Black\u2019s\nLaw Dictionary 836 (11th ed. 2019). What the District Court\nunderstood the term to mean in the present context is uncertain,\nbut this is clear: The District Court ignored a factor of the\nutmost importance, the incentives of the doctors in question.When the District Court made its assessment of\nthe doctors\u2019 \u201cgood faith,\u201d enforcement of Act 620 had been\npreliminarily enjoined, and the doctors surely knew that\nenforcement would be permanently barred if the lawsuit was\nsuccessful. Thus, the doctors had everything to lose and nothing to\ngain by obtaining privileges.[7] Two of the doctors\u2014Does 1 and 2\u2014are petitioners and\ncross-respondents in this Court. Two others, Does 5 and 6, were\nplaintiffs earlier but dropped out for unexplained reasons. See\nApp. 1327. And Doe 3, although not a plaintiff, is the medical\ndirector of June Medical, a party to this case.Id., at 186,\n206, 245.If these doctors had secured privileges, that\nwould have tended to defeat the lawsuit. Not only that, acquiring\nprivileges would have subjected all the doctors to the previously\ndescribed hospital monitoring, as well as any other obligations\nthat a hospital imposed on doctors with privileges, such as\nproviding unpaid care for the indigent. Seeinfra, at 21.\nThus, in light of the situation at the time when the doctors made\ntheir attempts to get privileges, they had an incentive to do as\nlittle as they thought the District Court would demand, not as much\nas they would if they stood to benefit from success.Given this incentive structure, the District\nCourt\u2019s \u201cgood faith\u201d test was not up to the task. Although the\nDistrict Court did not define exactly what the test required, \u201cgood\nfaith\u201d might easily mean only that a doctor lacked the subjective\nintent to avoid getting privileges. See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, at\n836 (defining \u201cgood faith\u201d to mean, among other things, \u201cabsence of\nintent to defraud or seek unconscionable advantage\u201d).In light of the doctors\u2019 incentives, more should\nhave been required. The court should have asked whether the\ndoctors\u2019 efforts to acquire privileges were equal to the efforts\nthey would have made if they knew that their ability to continue to\nperform abortions was at stake. The District Court did not do that,\nand because its finding on abortion access rests on the wrong legal\nstandard, it cannot stand. A finding based on an erroneous legal\ntest is invalid; it cannot be sustained under the \u201cclearly\nerroneous\u201d rule. SeeAbbottv.Perez, 585 U.\u00a0S.\n___, ___ (2018) (slip op., at 25) (\u201c\u00a0\u2018An appellate cour[t has]\npower to correct errors of law, including those that\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. infect .\u00a0.\u00a0. a finding of fact that is\npredicated on a misunderstanding of the governing rule of\nlaw\u2019\u00a0\u201d (quotingBose Corp. v.Consumers Union of\nUnited States, Inc.,466 U.S.\n485, 501 (1984)));Pullman-Standardv.Swint,456 U.S.\n273, 287 (1982) (similar); see also 9C C.

Five doctors\nperform abortions at those three locations: Doe 1, Doe 2, and Doe 3\nat June Medical; Doe 5 at Delta Clinic and Women\u2019s Clinic; and Doe\n6 at Women\u2019s Clinic. For purposes of the analysis that follows, I\nassume that Doe 1 could not get privileges.[9] If we also assume that none of these doctors would\nbe replaced if they ceased to perform abortions, the impact of the\nchallenged law on abortion access in the State depends on the\nability of four doctors to secure such privileges: Doe 2 (June\nMedical, Shreveport), Doe 3 (June Medical, Shreveport), Doe 5\n(Delta Clinic, Baton Rouge, and Women\u2019s Clinic, New Orleans), and\nDoe 6 (Women\u2019s Clinic, New Orleans). As I will show, under the\ncorrect legal standard, June Medical failed to prove that Act 620\nwould drive these four doctors out of the abortion practice.Doe 2. The District Court concluded that\nDoe 2 made a good-faith effort to obtain privileges, and the Court\nnow affirms that holding.Ante, at 27. It is painfully\nobvious, however, that Doe 2 did not act in the way one would\nexpect if compliance with Act 620 had been to his benefit.E-mails in the record reveal that Doe 2 only\nhalf-heartedly applied for privileges, did so on the advice of\ncounsel, and calculated that an outright denial would be best for\nhis legal challenge. See App. 1452 (\u201cThe lawyers think it is\nimportant that I at least have an application pending at a\nhospital\u201d);id., at 1453 (\u201cIt may, however, be more\nimportant from a legal challenge standpoint against this Bill just\nto have an application pendingor even denied\u201d (emphasis\nadded)).Consistent with this attitude, Doe 2 declined to\napply for privileges at a Shreveport-area hospital, Christus\nHealth, where he previously had privileges while performing\nabortions offsite and where another doctor who performed abortions,\nDoe 3, maintained privileges.Id., at 382. Doe 2 knew that\nDoe 3 had privileges at Christus Health, a hospital that grants\n\u201ccourtesy privileges,\u201d which allow doctors to admit patients but do\nnot require a minimum number of admissions. Seeid., at 406;\nRecord 12125 (bylaws).Doe 2\u2019s stated reasons for not applying to\nChristus Health are not reasons that are likely to have deterred an\nindividual with a strong personal incentive to obtain privileges.\nHe testified that Christus is a Catholic hospital and that he did\nnot apply there for that reason. App. 405\u2013406. He added that he\napplied to other hospitals where he \u201cknew people and might feel\nmore comfortable,\u201d \u201cplaces that [he] thought meant something\u201d and\nwhere he would have \u201cthe highest likelihood\u201d of obtaining\nprivileges.Id., at 454. A person with a strong personal\nincentive to get privileges is not likely to have found these\nreasons sufficient to justify failing even to apply.The District Court did not address Doe 2\u2019s\nfailure to apply to Christus Health. 250 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at\n68\u201374. The plurality, however, argues that Christus would not have\ngranted Doe 2 privileges because its bylaws object to abortion\npractice.Ante,at 25\u201326. But as noted, Christus Health had\npreviously granted privileges to doctors who perform abortions. Not\nonly did Doe 2 have privileges there while he was performing\nabortions, but Doe 3 has had privileges at Christus \u201coff and on\u201d\nfor \u201c30 years\u201d and was reappointed to the Christus Health staff in\n2012 and again in 2014. App. 272; Record 12102 (2012\u20132014);id.,at 12112 (2014\u20132016). Throughout this time, he\nperformed abortions. App. 206, 210.Attempting to justify Doe 2\u2019s decision not to\n(re)apply to Christus, the plurality suggests that Doe 3 (and by\nextension Doe 2) successfully concealed their abortion practice\nfrom Christus, and that if Doe 2 had applied for privileges,\nChristus would have discovered that he was performing abortions and\ndenied his application on that ground. It is doubtful that Christus\nwas actually in the dark, and speculative that an application would\nhave been denied for this reason.[10] But the important point is that a doctor with a\nstrong personal incentive would have tried and not simply gone\nthrough the motions.Instead of applying to Christus Health, Doe 2\nmade a formal application to Willis-Knighton Bossier City (WKBC)\nand an informal inquiry at University Hospital, but the record does\nnot show that he pursued those requests with any zeal. At WKBC, he\ndid not apply for courtesy privileges, which do not require a\nminimum number of admissions, Record 9642\u20139643, but instead sought\nan active staff position,id., at 9751, and according to Doe\n2, this application was doomed because he could not satisfy the\nminimum-admissions requirement for such a position, App. 384\u2013390.\nDoe 2 later sent a three-paragraph e-mail to a WKBC e-mail address\npurporting to amend his 102-page application so as to seek only\ncourtesy privileges,id., at 1446, but the record does not\nreflect whether that e-mail was received or processed, and\nsubsequent correspondence from WKBC does not acknowledge it,id., at 1435. Doe 2 stated that he sought an active staff\nposition \u201cto keep [his] practice options for the future open,\u201d\nRecord 9756, but that does not explain his lack of diligence in\nseeking courtesy staff privileges. Although it is true that WKBC\nrequested inpatient records from Doe 2 for an active staff\nposition, we do not know whether the hospital would have made the\nsame request had Doe 2 applied for courtesy privileges.Id.,\nat 1435.[11]Doe 2 said he made an informal inquiry about\nadmitting privileges at University Hospital, where he has\nconsulting privileges, but that the head of the OB/GYN Department,\nDr. Groome, \u201cessentially said\u201d that the hospital would not upgrade\nhis credentials.Id., at 384. Doe 2 attributed this to \u201cthe\npolitical nature of what I do and the controversy of what I do.\u201dIbid. But Doe 2 did not introduce evidence (or seek to\nelicit testimony from Dr. Groome) substantiating his account of\nthis informal inquiry.Doe 2\u2019s account raises obvious questions. Since\nhe wasalreadya member of the University Hospital staff, it\nis not apparent why the hospital would reject his request for\nupgraded privileges because of \u201cthe political nature\u201d of his\npractice.Id., at 440\u2013441. And University Hospital has long\nbeen on notice of Doe 2\u2019s abortion practice. He has been affiliated\nwith that hospital since 1979, Record 9757, and has performed\nabortions since 1980,id., at 9759.In sum, Doe 2 all but admitted in his e-mails\nthat his efforts to obtain privileges were perfunctory; he declined\nto apply at a hospital where he previously had privileges; at the\nonly hospital where he made a formal application, he sought a\nposition he knew he could not get for lack of a sufficient number\nof admissions; and at one other hospital (where he already had\nconsulting privileges) he did no more than make an informal\ninquiry. The District Court should have considered whether Doe 2\u2019s\nefforts were consistent with the conduct of a person who really\nwanted to get privileges.Doe 5. Doe 5 is an OB/GYN who performs\nabortions at Women\u2019s Clinic in New Orleans and Delta Clinic in\nBaton Rouge. Doe 5 did not testify at the hearing in District\nCourt, but the District Court found that he proceeded in \u201cgood\nfaith\u201d based on a declaration and the transcript of a deposition.\n250 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at 75\u201376.Doe 5 obtained courtesy privileges at Touro\nHospital in New Orleans, see App. 1401, and therefore all agree\nthat Act 620 would not prevent him from practicing at Women\u2019s\nClinic,id., at 1397. The remaining question is whether the\nlaw would bar him from performing abortions in Baton Rouge.Doe 5 could continue to do that if one hospital\nin that area granted him admitting privileges, and Doe 5 testified\nthat one, Woman\u2019s Hospital, will grant him privileges once he finds\na doctor who is willing to cover him when he is not available. Seeid., at 1334. Doe 5 asked exactly one doctor to serve as his\ncovering physician. That does not show that he \u201ccould not find a\ncovering physician,\u201dante,at 23, if he made other\ninquiries.The plurality justifies Doe 5\u2019s meager effort\nbased on pure speculation. Because the one doctor Doe 5 asked had a\ntransfer agreement with the Baton Rouge abortion clinic, the\nplurality reasons that \u201cDoe 5 could have reasonably thought that,\nif this doctor wouldn\u2019t serve as his covering physician, no one\nwould.\u201dAnte, at 28. The plurality goes on to say that \u201cit\nwas well within the District Court\u2019s discretion to credit that\nreading of the record.\u201dIbid.This argument shows how far the plurality is\nwilling to go to strike down the Louisiana law. The plurality\nrelies on speculation about why Doe 5 made only one inquiry and why\nthe District Court found this one inquiry sufficient. In fact,\nhowever, Doe 5 never explained why he asked only one doctor, and he\nnever intimated that he gave up because that doctor had a transfer\nagreement with the clinic. Nor did the District Court rely on that\ninference in finding that Doe 5 exhibited good faith. See 250\nF.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at 75\u201376. And in any event, even if Doe 5 had a\nparticularly strong reason to hope that the doctor he asked would\nagree to cover for him, it hardly follows that other inquiries\nwould necessarily fail.Doe 5 applied for privileges at two other area\nhospitals, Lane and Baton Rouge, but he did not even call back to\ncheck on them because he thought his \u201cbest chances for privileges\n[were] at Woman\u2019s Hospital,\u201d App. 1334, and he noted that Lane and\nBaton Rouge require that their doctors treat some indigent patients\n\u201cfor free basically\u201d while opening themselves up to liability,id., at 1335. Also, Doe 5 explained, Lane is \u201cfurther away\u201d\nfrom the Delta Clinic than the other hospitals.Ibid.To sum up Doe 5\u2019s situation: The challenged law\nwould have no effect on him if he could find a covering doctor in\nBaton Rouge, but he asked only one doctor. He did little to pursue\napplications at two other hospitals because he was not optimistic\nabout his chances and those hospitals required a certain amount of\nunpaid service to the poor.Doe 6. Doe 6 is a Board-certified OB/GYN\nwho practices at Women\u2019s Clinic in New Orleans. There are nine\nqualifying New Orleans-area hospitals, and according to his\naffidavit, Doe 6 made an informal inquiry at one and filed a formal\napplication at another. The District Court found that he attempted\nin \u201cgood faith\u201d to obtain admitting privileges even though Doe 6\ndid not testify and was never subjected to adversarial questioning.\nThe only relevant information before the court were several\nparagraphs in Doe 6\u2019s declaration,id., at 1307\u20131313, and\nhearsay in the declaration of the Women\u2019s Clinic administrator,id., at 1119\u20131131; see also 250 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at\n76\u201377.These questionable sources left many important\nquestions unanswered, for example, why Doe 6 did not apply for\nprivileges at Touro Hospital, where Doe 5, who also performs\nabortions at Women\u2019s Clinic, has privileges.The plurality provides an explanation that is\nfound nowhere in the record,i.e., that Doe 6 could not get\nprivileges at Touro because, unlike Doe 5, who performs both\nsurgical and medication abortions, Doe 6 performs only medication\nabortions.Ante, at 30. Not only is this pure speculation,\nbut it is not evident why this difference might matter. The\nplurality notes that Doe 6\u2019s medication abortion patients have\nnever been admitted to a hospital, but the plurality also argues\nthat very few surgical abortion patients are admitted.Ante,\nat 30, 37. If Doe 6 had testified or been deposed, he could have\nbeen asked about his decision not to apply at Touro, but that did\nnot occur.Aside from Touro, there are eight other\nhospitals in the New Orleans area, but Doe 6 apparently made no\nattempt to get privileges at six of these, and nothing in the scant\nrecord explains why. He stated that he formally applied at East\nJefferson Hospital and made an informal inquiry at Tulane Hospital,\nbut much about these efforts is unknown. No representative from\nTulane or East Jefferson testified or was deposed, and no documents\nrelating to either application were offered.With respect to Doe 6\u2019s informal inquiry at\nTulane, all that the District Court had before it was a single\nparagraph in Doe 6\u2019s declaration in which he stated that he spoke\nto an unnamed individual and was told he should not bother to apply\nbecause he did not have the requisite number of admissions per\nyear. App. 1310. Nothing in the record reveals the type of\nprivileges about which Doe 6 inquired.Doe 6 furnished even less information about his\nformal application to East Jefferson hospital\u2014a hospital which\noffers courtesy privileges, and does not impose an admissions\nrequirement for those privileges. Record 10679. In his declaration,\nwhich he signed in September 2014, Doe 6 wrote that he had applied\nbut had not received a response. App. 1311. A few weeks later, June\nMedical\u2019s counsel informed the District Court by letter that Doe 6\nhad complied with East Jefferson\u2019s request for additional\ninformation,id., at 54, but the record says nothing about\nany later developments. Presumably, East Jefferson did not grant\nprivileges, but the record does not disclose why. Did Doe 6 provide\nall the information that the hospital requested and do everything\nelse required by the application process? The record is silent, and\nthe District Court was incurious.Doe 3. Doe 3, who performs abortions at\nthe June Medical clinic in Shreveport, would not be directly\naffected by Act 620 because he maintains privileges at two area\nhospitals, Christus Health and WKBC, but he stated that he would\nstop performing abortions if, as a result of that law, he was left\nas the only abortion doctor in the northern part of the State.Id.,at 236. Thus, if Doe 1 or Doe 2 got privileges and\ncontinued to perform abortions, Doe 3, according to his testimony,\nwould remain as well.[12]Putting all this together, it is apparent that\nthe record does not come close to showing that Doe 2, Doe 5, and\nDoe 6 made the sort of effort that one would expect if their\nability to continue performing abortions had depended on success.\nThese doctors had an incentive to do the bare minimum that they\nthought the judge would demand\u2014and as it turned out, the judge did\nnot demand much, not even an appearance in his courtroom. In short,\nthe record does not show that Act 620 would drive any of these\ndoctors out of abortion practice, and therefore the Act would not\nlead Doe 3 to leave either. It follows that the District Court\u2019s\nfinding on Act 620\u2019s likely effects cannot stand.CThe Court should remand this case for a new\ntrial under the correct legal standards. The District Court should\napplyCasey\u2019s \u201csubstantial obstacle\u201d test, not theWhole\nWoman\u2019s Healthbalancing test. And it should require those\nchallenging Act 620 to demonstrate that the doctors who lack\nadmitting privileges attempted to obtain them with the same zeal\nthey would have exhibited if the Act were in effect and they stood\nto lose by failing in those efforts.IVOn remand, the District Court should not\npermit June Medical to assert the rights of women wishing to obtain\nan abortion. The court should require the joinder of a plaintiff\nwhose own rights are at stake. Our precedents rarely permit a\nplaintiff to assert the rights of a third party, and June Medical\ncannot satisfy our established test for third-party standing.\nIndeed, what June Medical seeks is something we have never allowed.\nIt wants to rely on the rights of third parties whose interests\nconflict with its own.AThe plurality holds that Louisiana waived any\nobjection to June Medical\u2019s third-party standing,ante,at\n12, but that is a misreading of the record. The plurality relies on\na passing statement in a brief filed by the State in District Court\nin connection with the plaintiffs\u2019 request for a temporary\nrestraining order, but the statement is simply an accurate\nstatement of circuit precedent on the standing of abortion\nproviders. See App. 44. It does not constitute a waiver.It is true that Louisiana did not affirmatively\nmake the third-party standing argument until it filed its cross-\npetition for certiorari, but \u201c[w]e may make exceptions to our\ngeneral approach to claims not raised below.\u201dPolar Tankers,\nInc.v.City of Valdez,557 U.S.\n1, 14 (2009). A party\u2019s failure to raise an issue does not\ndeprive us of the power to take it up, so long as the court below\nhas passed on the question. SeeLebronv.National\nRailroad Passenger Corporation,513 U.S.\n374, 379 (1995) (\u201c[E]ven if this were a claim not raised by\npetitioner below, we would ordinarily feel free to address it since\nit was addressed by the court below\u201d (emphasis deleted)); S.\nShapiro et\u00a0al., Supreme Court Practice \u00a76\u201326(b), p.\u00a06\u2013104\n(11th ed. 2019) (collecting cases).In this case, no one disputes that the Fifth\nCircuit passed on the issue of third-party standing in Louisiana\u2019s\nappeal from the District Court\u2019s entry of a preliminary injunction.June Medical Services, L. L. C.v.Gee, 814 F.3d 319,\n322\u2013323 (2016). And when we granted the State\u2019s cross-petition, we\ntook up this question and received briefing and argument on it. 589\nU.\u00a0S. ___ (2019).We have a strong reason to decide the question\nof third-party standing because it implicates the integrity of\nfuture proceedings that should occur in this case. This case should\nbe remanded for a new trial, and we should not allow that to occur\nwithout a proper plaintiff. Nothing compels us to forbear from\naddressing this issue. SeeCarlsonv.Green,446 U.S.\n14, 17, n.\u00a02 (1980); Shapiro, Supreme Court Practice\n\u00a76.26(h), at 6\u2013111.BThis case features a blatant conflict of\ninterest between an abortion provider and its patients. Like any\nother regulated entity, an abortion provider has a financial\ninterest in avoiding burdensome regulations such as Act 620\u2019s\nadmitting privileges requirement. Applying for privileges takes\ntime and energy, and maintaining privileges may impose additional\nburdens. See App. 1335. Women seeking abortions, on the other hand,\nhave an interest in the preservation of regulations that protect\ntheir health. The conflict inherent in such a situation is\nglaring.Some may not see the conflict in this case\nbecause they are convinced that the admitting privileges\nrequirement does nothing to promote safety and is really just a\nploy. But an abortion provider\u2019s ability to assert the rights of\nwomen when it challenges ostensible safety regulations should not\nturn on the merits of its claim.The problem with the rule that the majority\nembraces is highlighted if we consider challenges to other safety\nregulations. Suppose, for example, that a clinic in a State that\nallows certified non-physicians to perform abortions claims that\nthe State\u2019s certification requirements are too onerous and that\nthey imperil the clinic\u2019s continued operation. Should the clinic be\nable to assert the rights of women in attacking this regulation,\nwhich the state lawmakers thought was important to protect women\u2019s\nhealth?When an abortion regulation is enacted for the\nasserted purpose of protecting the health of women, an abortion\nprovider seeking to strike down that law should not be able to rely\non the constitutional rights of women. Like any other party unhappy\nwith burdensome regulation, the provider should be limited to its\nown rights.CThis rule is supported by precedent and\nfollows from general principles regarding conflicts of interest. We\nhave already held that third-party standing is not appropriate\nwhere there is a potential conflict of interest between the\nplaintiff and the third party. InElk Grove Unified School\nDist. v.Newdow,542 U.S.\n1, 9, 15, and n.\u00a07 (2004), a potential conflict of\ninterest between the plaintiff and his daughter arose on appeal.\nThe father had asserted that his daughter had a constitutional\nright not to hear others recite the words \u201c\u00a0\u2018under God\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nwhen the pledge of allegiance was recited at her public school, but\nthe child\u2019s mother maintained that her daughter had \u201cno objection\neither to reciting or hearing\u201d the full pledge.Id., at 5,\n9. The Court held that the father lacked prudential standing,\nbecause \u201cthe interests of this parent and this child are not\nparallel and, indeed, are potentially in conflict.\u201dId., at\n15. The lower court\u2019s judgment (based, as it was, on a presentation\nby a conflicted party) was therefore reversed.Newdowrecognized the seriousness of\nconflicts of interest in the specific context of third-party\nclaims, but the law is always sensitive to potential conflicts when\na party sues in a representative capacity. Parties naturally\n\u201ctailor their own presentation to the interest that each of them\nhas,\u201d and a conflict therefore creates \u201ca risk that the party will\nnot provide adequate representation of the interest of the\nabsentee.\u201d See 7C Wright & Miller \u00a71909. Thus, in class-action\nsuits, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a)(4) demands that the\nnamed plaintiff possess \u201cthe same interest and suffer the same\ninjury\u201d as class members.General Telephone Co. of Southwestv.Falcon,457 U.S.\n147, 156 (1982) (internal quotation marks omitted). That\nrequirement, we have said, \u201cserves to uncover conflicts of interest\nbetween named parties and the class they seek to represent.\u201dAmchem Products, Inc. v.Windsor,521 U.S.\n591, 625 (1997). Similarly, under Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 17(c), a party representing a minor or incompetent person\nmay be replaced if the representative has conflicting interests.\nSeeSam M.v.Carcieri, 608 F.3d 77, 86 (CA1 2010);\n6A Wright & Miller \u00a71570. And of course, an attorney cannot\nrepresent a client if their interests conflict.[13]DThe conflict of interest inherent in a case\nlike this is reason enough to reject third-party standing, and our\nstandard rules on third-party standing provide a second,\nindependent reason. As a general rule, a plaintiff \u201cmust assert his\nown legal rights and interests, and cannot rest his claim to relief\non the legal rights or interests of third parties.\u201dWarthv.Seldin,422 U.S.\n490, 499 (1975). We have recognized a \u201climited\u201d exception to\nthis rule, but in order to qualify, a litigant must demonstrate (1)\ncloseness to the third party and (2) a hindrance to the third\nparty\u2019s ability to bring suit.Kowalskiv.Tesmer,543 U.S.\n125, 129\u2013130 (2004); see alsoPowersv.Ohio,499 U.S.\n400, 410\u2013411 (1991).The record shows that abortion providers cannot\nsatisfy either prong of this test. First, a woman who obtains an\nabortion typically does not develop a close relationship with the\ndoctor who performs the procedure. On the contrary, their\nrelationship is generally brief and very limited. In Louisiana, a\nwoman may make her first visit to an abortion clinic the day before\nthe procedure, and if she goes to June Medical, she is likely to\nhave a short meeting with a counselor, not the doctor who will\nactually perform the procedure. See App. 784\u2013786. She will\ntypically meet the abortion doctor for the first time just before\nthe procedure, and if Doe 1\u2019s description is representative, their\nrelationship consists of the doctor\u2019s telling the woman what he\nwill do, offering to answer questions, informing her of his\nprogress as the abortion is performed, and asking her to remain\ncalm.Id., at 688. Doe 4 testified that the surgical\nprocedure itself takes \u201ctwo or three minutes.\u201d Record 14144. Doe 3\ntestified that he can perform six abortions an hour and once\nperformed 64 abortions in a 2-day period. App. 207, 243.In the case of medication abortions, patients\nare required to schedule a follow-up appointment three weeks after\nthe procedure, seeid., at 129\u2013131, 690, but surgical\nabortions, which constitute the majority of the procedures at June\nMedical and across the State, do not require any follow-up,id., at 691, and the great majority of women never return to\nthe clinic,id., at 131; accord,id., at 1342 (Doe\n5).This description of doctor-patient interactions\nat June Medical is similar to those recounted in testimony heard by\nthe legislature. See Record 11263 (\u201cthere was no doctor/patient\nrelationship\u201d);id., at 11226 (\u201cI can tell you, women I\u2019ve\ncounseled, many times they don\u2019t know who the abortion provider\nis\u201d).Amiciwho have had abortions recount similarly distant\nrelationships with their abortion doctors.[14] For these reasons, the first prong of the\nthird-party standing rule cannot be met.Nor can the second, which requires that there be\na hindrance to the ability of the third party to bring suit. SeeKowalski, 543 U.\u00a0S., at 130. The plurality opinion inSingletonv.Wulff,428 U.S.\n106, 117 (1976), found that women seeking abortions were\nhindered from bringing suit, but the reasoning in that opinion is\nhard to defend. The opinion identified two purported obstacles to\nsuits by women wishing to obtain abortions\u2014the women\u2019s desire to\nprotect their privacy and the prospect of mootness.Ibid.\nBut as Justice Powell said at the time, these \u201calleged \u2018obstacles\u2019\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. are chimerical.\u201dId., at 126 (opinion\nconcurring in part and dissenting in part).First, a woman who challenges an abortion\nrestriction can sue under a pseudonym, and many have done so.Ibid. (\u201cOur docket regularly contains cases in which women,\nusing pseudonyms, challenge statutes that allegedly infringe their\nright to exercise the abortion decision\u201d). Other precautions may be\ntaken during the course of litigation to avoid revealing their\nidentities. See App. 196.[15] And there is little reason to think that a woman who\nchallenges an abortion restriction will have to pay for counsel.\nSee Brief for Respondent/Cross-Petitioner 40\u201341.Second, if a woman seeking an abortion brings\nsuit, her claim will survive the end of her pregnancy under the\ncapable-of-repetition-yet-evading-review exception to mootness. SeeRoev.Wade,410\nU.S. 113, 125 (1973) (\u201cPregnancy provides a classic\njustification for a conclusion of nonmootness\u201d). To be sure, when\nthe pregnancy terminates, an individual plaintiff\u00a0\u2019s immediate\ninterest in prosecuting the case may diminish. But this is\ngenerally true whenever the\ncapable-of-repetition-yet-evading-review exception applies. See 13C\nWright & Miller \u00a73533.8 (collecting examples).TheSingletonplurality opinion is the\nonly opinion in which any Members of this Court have ever attempted\nto justify third-party standing for abortion providers, and judged\non its own merits, the opinion is thoroughly unconvincing.EThe Court does not address the conflict of\ninterest inherent in this challenge, or plaintiffs\u2019 failure to\nsatisfy the two prongs of our third-party standing doctrine. SeeKowalski, 543 U.\u00a0S., at 130. Instead, the plurality\nsays that it \u201cis .\u00a0.\u00a0. common\u201d in third-party standing\ncase law for \u201cplaintiffs [to] challeng[e] a law ostensibly enacted\nto protect [a third party] whose rights they are asserting.\u201dAnte, at 15. In support of this strange proposition, the\nplurality cites two of our prior decisions, but neither decision\nacknowledged or addressed any potential conflict of interest, and\nboth cases involved circumstances very different from those present\nhere. Both cases also featured facts assuring that third-party\ninterests were fairly represented.In the first case,Craigv.Boren,429 U.S.\n190(1976), the sole appellant with a live claim at the time of\ndecision was a beer vendor who challenged a law that allowed\nfemales to purchase 3.2% beer at the age of 18 but barred males\nfrom making such purchases until they turned 21.Id., at\n193. The Court\u2019s lead explanation for its refusal to dismiss had\nnothing to do with the merits of the vendor\u2019s third-party standing\nclaim. The Court noted that the other appellant, Curtis Craig, had\nbeen under the age of 21 during the proceedings below, that the\nappellees had not raised a standing objection below, and that they\nhad not pressed an objection in this Court.Id., at\n192\u2013194.Only after this discussion did the Court say\nanything about the merits of the third-party claim, and even then,\nthe Court said nothing about a conflict of interest between the\nvendor and underage males. The plurality now claims there was a\npotential conflict: Young men under the age of 21 had an interest\nin being barred from buying beer in order to protect themselves\nfrom their own reckless conduct. Suffice it to say that there is no\nindication that this supposed conflict occurred to anybody whenCraigwas before this Court.The plurality\u2019s second case,Department of\nLaborv.Triplett,494 U.S.\n715(1990), is even weaker. A state bar ethics committee filed\na disciplinary proceeding in state court against a lawyer who had\nentered into an attorney-fee arrangement that was prohibited by a\nprovision of the Black Lung Benefits Act. When the State Supreme\nCourt ruled in favor of the lawyer on the ground that the provision\nin question violated Black Lung claimants\u2019 constitutional right to\ncounsel, both the bar ethics committee and the Department of Labor,\nwhich had intervened in state court, successfully petitioned for\nreview in this Court. We then held that the attorney could defend\nthe decision below based on the rights of his client.Triplettis inapposite here for at least\ntwo reasons. First, the lawyer in that case did not initiate the\nlitigation. Second, because the case arose in state court, his\nright to invoke his client\u2019s rights in that forum was a question of\nstate law. Had we prevented him from asserting those rights in this\nCourt, he would have been unable to defend himself against the\npetitioners\u2019 arguments. And on top of all this,Triplett,as\nwe noted inKowalski, \u201cinvolved the representation of known\nclaimants,\u201d and that \u201cexisting attorney-client relationship [was]\nquite different from the hypothetical .\u00a0.\u00a0. relationship\u201d\nbetween the abortion providers and clients in the present case. 543\nU.\u00a0S., at 131. ThatCraigandTriplettare the\nbest authorities the plurality can find is telling proof of the\nweakness of its position.FAs The Chief Justice points out,stare\ndecisisgenerally counsels adherence to precedent, and in\ndeciding whether to overrule a prior decision, we consider factors\nbeyond the strength of the precedent\u2019s reasoning.Ante, at\n3\u20134. But here, such factors weigh in favor of overruling.Reexamination of a precedent may be appropriate\nwhen it is an \u201coutlier\u201d and its reasoning cannot be reconciled with\nother established precedents, seeFranchise Tax Bd. of Cal.v.Hyatt, 587 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2019) (slip op., at 17);Janusv.State, County, and Municipal Employees, 585\nU.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2018) (slip op., at 43);United Statesv.Gaudin,515 U.S.\n506, 521 (1995);Rodriguez de Quijasv.Shearson/American Express, Inc.,490\nU.S. 477, 484 (1989), and that is true of the rule allowing\nabortion providers to assert their patients\u2019 rights. The parties\nhave not brought to our attention any other situation in which a\nparty is allowed to invoke the right of a third party with\nblatantly adverse interests. The rule that the majority applies\nhere is an abortion-only rule.The Chief Justice properly notes that subsequent\nlegal developments may support overruling a precedent,ante,\nat 3\u20134, and that factor too is present here. Both our general\nstanding jurisprudence and our treatment of third-party standing\nhave changed sinceSingleton. We have stressed the\nimportance of insisting that a plaintiff assert an injury that is\nparticular to its own situation. See,e.g.,Spokeo,\nInc.v.Robins, 578 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip\nop., at 7);Clapperv.Amnesty Int\u2019l USA,568 U.S.\n398, 409 (2013);Lujanv.Defenders of Wildlife,504 U.S.\n555, 560 (1992). Moreover, inKowalski,543 U.S.\n125, we refined our rule for third-party standing, and inNewdow,542 U.S.\n1, we made it clear that a plaintiff cannot sue on behalf of a\nthird party if the parties\u2019 interests may conflict.The presence or absence of reliance is often a\ncritical factor in applying the doctrine of stare decisis, see,e.g.,Franchise Tax Bd., 587 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 17);Janus, 585 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at\n44);South Dakotav.Wayfair, Inc., 585 U.\u00a0S.\n___, ___ (2018) (slip op., at 20);Hiltonv.South\nCarolina Public Railways Comm\u2019n,502 U.S.\n197, 206\u2013207 (1991), but neither the plurality nor The Chief\nJustice claims that any reliance interests are at stake here. Women\nwishing to obtain abortions have not taken any action in reliance\non the ability of abortion providers to sue on their behalf, and\neliminating third-party standing for providers would not interfere\nwith the ability of women to sue. Nor does it appear that abortion\nproviders have done anything in reliance on the special third-party\nstanding rule they have enjoyed. If that rule were abrogated, they\ncould still ask to intervene or appear as anamicus curiaein a suit brought by a woman, but it is deeply offensive to our\nrules of standing to permit them to sue in the name of their\npatients when they challenge laws enacted to protect their\npatients\u2019 safety.On remand, the District Court should permit the\njoinder of a plaintiff with standing and should not proceed until\nsuch a plaintiff appears.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*The decision in this case, like that inWhole Woman\u2019s Health, twists the law, and I therefore\nrespectfully dissent.Notes1Quality Check, Find a\nGold Seal Health Care Organization (2020),\nhttps\u00a0:\u00a0//\u00a0www\u00a0.qualitycheck\u00a0.\u00a0org\u00a0/\u00a0search\u00a0/\u00a0?\u00a0keyword=louisiana\u00a0#\u00a0keyword\u00a0=louisiana&accreditationprogram=Hospital\n(listing \u201c[o]rganizations that have achieved The Gold Seal of\nApproval from the Joint Commission\u201d).2Ryan, Negligent\nCredentialing: A Cause of Action for Hospital Peer Review\nDecisions, 59 How.

Brief for Petitioners in No.\n18\u20131323, p.\u00a041, n.\u00a07. As the record in this case shows,\nthere is reason to doubt that the prospect of rejection provides a\nsufficient incentive for doctors to pursue privileges vigorously.\nSeeinfra, at 15\u201323. Perhaps that is because only rejections\nfor lack of \u201cprofessional competence or professional conduct\u201d need\nto be disclosed to the relevant federal database. 45 CFR \u00a7\u00a760.12,\n60.3 (2019). Petitioners also have not explained how a\nnon-competence-based rejection would have any bearing on future\napplications for privileges.8The plurality claims that\nmy criticism of the District Court\u2019s \u201cgood faith\u201d standard \u201cis not\na legal argument,\u201d and instead reflects a view of the facts\u2014namely\nthat the Does acted in \u201cbad faith.\u201dAnte, at 24. But the\nDistrict Court used \u201cgood faith\u201d as the legal standard to assess\nwhether Act 620 would cause the Does to stop performing abortions.\nNeither the District Court nor the plurality has defined \u201cgood\nfaith.\u201d Unless that term reflects what the doctors would have done\nif the incentives had been reversed\u2014and the plurality does not\nargue that it does\u2014there is a legal issue.9The Fifth Circuit\nconcluded that it would be \u201cnearly impossible\u201d for Doe 1 to get\nprivileges,June Medical Services L. L. C.v.Gee,\n905 F.3d 787, 812 (2018), and for this reason, the plurality does\nnot linger on Doe 1.Ante, at 23. Under the correct legal\nstandard, however, it is not at all clear that Doe 1 made the\neffort required, at least with respect to Christus Health in\nShreveport. He applied there for courtesy privileges, received\nletters instructing him to pick up a badge, and when he called to\nclarify the meaning of letters sent to him, an unnamed doctor\nsupposedly told him that he should apply for \u201csome kind of a\nnonstaff caregiver type\u201d position, App. 725, and he then ceased all\nefforts to get courtesy staff privileges at Christus,id.,\nat 728. A person with a strong personal incentive to obtain\ncourtesy privileges would not necessarily have taken this somewhat\ncryptic advice as a definite rejection of his\napplication.10The\nsuggestion that Doe 2\u2019s abortion practice could have eluded\nChristus (and therefore that it would be an impediment to obtaining\nprivileges again) blinks reality. There is no evidence that the\nhospital was unaware of Doe 2\u2019s abortion practice when he was on\nstaff. Nor is there reason to believe that Christus would not have\nreviewed Doe 2\u2019s professional practice history, Record 12190\u201312191,\nor demanded disclo-sure of past malpractice claims at the time he\nheld privileges there,id., at 12194; App. 374 (medical\nmalpractice claim against Doe 2 arising from practice at June\nMedical); see alsosupra, at 4\u20137 (reviewing hospital\ncredentialing). The notion that Doe 3\u2019s abortion practice has\nescaped attention for 30 years is even harder to believe. Christus\nhas reappointed Doe 3 in recent years based on a biennial process\nthat assesses \u201c[p]erformance and conduct in each hospital and/or\nother healthcare organizatio[n]\u201d outside of Christus. Record 12136;\nsee alsoibid. (requiring staff members to submit\n\u201creapplication form [with] complete information to update his/her\nfile on items listed in his/her original application\u201d). Doe 3\nspends \u201cThursday afternoon\u201d and \u201call day on Saturday\u201d at the\nabortion clinic, App. 206, and therefore presumably is unavailable\nfor his on-call duties at Christus at those times, Record 12123.\nDoe 3 is affiliated with the National Abortion Federation and has\nattended \u201cmany\u201d of their national conferences to obtain continuing\nmedical education credits. App. 203. And Doe 3 indicated that all\neight OB/GYNs in Bossier City learned of his abortion practice when\ndiscussing a possible on-call rotation system. Seeid., at\n200\u2013202. If those facts did not tip off the hospital, perhaps\nChristus learned about Doe 3\u2019s abortion practice when one of his\npatients was transferred directly from June Medical to Christus,\nbleeding and in need of a hysterectomy,id., at 217\u2013218, or\nwhen Doe 1\u2019s privileges application named Doe 3 as a peer\nreference, Record 13025. Whatever the Christus bylaws say, abortion\npractice does not appear to have presented an obstacle to a\nsuccessful association with the hospital.11Each\nyear, a physician with courtesy staff privileges at WKBC may have\nas many as 49 \u201cpatient contacts,\u201d which are defined as \u201cany\nadmission and management, consultation, procedure, response to\nemergency call, and newborns.\u201d Record 9628, 9642 (capitalization\nomitted). And contrary to the plurality\u2019s suggestion, the fact that\nWKBC imposes the same \u201c[f]actors for [e]valuation\u201d for courtesy and\nactive staff-applicants says little, since those factors do not set\nout any quantum of patient records, and require only \u201crelevant\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. experience\u201d for the position sought.Id.,at\n9669.12The\nplurality suggests that, if Doe 3 were to leave abortion practice,\nit would be attributable to Act 620. But even the most ardent\nopponents of Act 620 did not contemplate that the law would prompt\nabortion doctors whosatisfiedthe law\u2019s requirements to\nquit. Record 11231\u201311234, 11291. And if this outcome was not\nforeseeable at the time of enactment, it is hard to see how the\nDistrict Court could blame Act 620 for causing Doe 3 to leave\nabortion practice. Cf. Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7440, \u00a7442A\n(1964).13See,e.g., ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct 1.7\u20131.9, 1.18\n(2016).14See\nBrief for 2,624 Women Injured by Abortion et\u00a0al. asAmici\nCuriae14\u201322 (firsthand accounts of abortion procedures in\nLouisiana); Brief for Priests for Life et\u00a0al. asAmici\nCuriae7\u20138, and App. (accounts from Louisiana and other\nStates).15Four\ncases to reach this Court have featured exclusively women\nplaintiffs.

But there are a number of cases in which women have\nbeen co-plaintiffs along with abortion clinics or providers.
