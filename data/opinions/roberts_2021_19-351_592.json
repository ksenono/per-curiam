The statute, however, sets forth several\nspecific exceptions. One such exception provides that a sovereign\ndoes not enjoy immunity in any case \u201cin which rights in property\ntaken in violation of international law are in issue.\u201d 28\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71605(a)(3). The question presented is whether a\ncountry\u2019s alleged taking of property from its own nationals falls\nwithin this exception.IThis case concerns several dozen medieval\nrelics and devotional objects known as the Welfenschatz. The\ntreasure (\u201cschatz\u201d) of the German Welf dynasty, the pieces date\nback to the early days of the Holy Roman Empire and occupy a unique\nposition in German history and culture. The collection was\nassembled within Germany\u2019s Brunswick Cathedral over the course of\nseveral centuries, before being moved to a Hanoverian chapel in\n1671 and later to Switzerland for safekeeping in the wake of World\nWar I.During the waning years of the Weimar Republic,\na consortium of three art firms owned by Jewish residents of\nFrankfurt purchased the Welfenschatz from the Duke of Brunswick. By\n1931, the consortium had sold about half of the collection\u2019s pieces\nto museums and individuals in Europe and the United States,\nincluding many to the Cleveland Museum of Art, where they reside\ntoday.Conditions facing the consortium changed\ndramatically after the collapse of the German economy and the rise\nof the Nazi government. After ascending to power, Hermann\nGoering\u2014Adolf Hitler\u2019s deputy and the Prime Minister of\nPrussia\u2014became interested in the remainder of the Welfenschatz. The\ncomplaint alleges that he employed a combination of political\npersecution and physical threats to coerce the consortium into\nselling the remaining pieces to Prussia in 1935 for approximately\none-third of their value. Two of the consortium members fled the\ncountry following the sale, and the third died in Germany shortly\nthereafter.The United States took possession of the\nWelfenschatz in the course of the occupation of Nazi Germany at the\nend of the war, eventually turning the collection over to the\nFederal Republic of Germany. For nearly 60 years, the treasure has\nbeen maintained by Stiftung Preussischer Kulturbesitz (SPK)\u2014the\nPrussian Cultural Heritage Foundation\u2014and it is now displayed at a\nmuseum in Berlin. SPK is an instrumentality of the Federal\nRepublic.Respondents are two United States citizens and a\ncitizen of the United Kingdom who trace their lineages back to the\nthree members of the consortium. The heirs first approached SPK\nclaiming that the sale of the Welfenschatz to the Prussian\nGovernment was unlawful. SPK conducted its own investigation of the\nsale and determined that the transaction occurred at a fair market\nprice without coercion.In 2014, the parties agreed to submit the claim\nto the German Advisory Commission for the Return of Cultural\nProperty Seized as a Result of Nazi Persecution, Especially Jewish\nProperty. Germany established the Advisory Commission under the\nWashington Conference Principles on Nazi-Confiscated Art, an\ninitiative spearheaded by the United States to encourage the\ndevelopment of new mechanisms for resolving Nazi-era claims. See\nBrief for United States asAmicus Curiae4. After hearing\nfrom expert witnesses and reviewing documentary evidence, the\nCommission likewise concluded that the sale had occurred at a fair\nprice without duress.Disappointed by the proceedings in Germany, the\nheirs filed suit in Federal District Court in Washington,\nD.\u00a0C. They brought several common law property claims against\nGermany and SPK, seeking $250 million in compensation. Petitioners\nSPK and the Federal Republic of Germany\u2014collectively Germany\u2014moved\nto dismiss the case. Relevant here, Germany argued that it was\nimmune from suit because the heirs\u2019 claims did not fall within the\nFSIA\u2019s exception to immunity for \u201cproperty taken in violation of\ninternational law.\u201d See 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71605(a)(3); see also\n\u00a71603(a) (defining \u201cforeign state\u201d to include \u201can agency or\ninstrumentality of a foreign state\u201d). In doing so, Germany reasoned\nthat the purchase of the Welfenschatz could not have violated\ninternational law because a sovereign\u2019s taking of its own\nnationals\u2019 property is not unlawful under the international law of\nexpropriation. The heirs responded that the exception did apply\nbecause Germany\u2019s purchase of the Welfenschatz was an act of\ngenocide and the taking therefore violated the international law of\ngenocide.The District Court denied Germany\u2019s motion, 248\nF.\u00a0Supp.\u00a03d 59, 70\u201374 (DC 2017), and a panel of the\nD.\u00a0C. Circuit affirmed, 894 F.3d 406 (2018). The panel agreed\nwith the heirs that the exception for property taken in violation\nof international law was satisfied because \u201cgenocide perpetrated by\na state even against its own nationals is a violation of\ninternational law.\u201dId.,at 410\u2013411 (quotingSimonv.Republic of Hungary, 812 F.3d 127, 145 (CADC 2016);\nalterations omitted). The D.\u00a0C. Circuit declined Germany\u2019s\nrequest for en banc review. 925 F.3d 1349 (2019)\n(per\u00a0curiam).Judge Katsas dissented from the denial of\nrehearing en banc. In his view, the majority\u2019s analysis erroneously\n\u201cma[de] the district court sit as a war crimes tribunal to\nadjudicate claims of genocide,\u201d while \u201cclear[ing] the way for a\nwide range of litigation against foreign sovereigns for public acts\ncommitted within their own territories.\u201dId., at 1350.We granted certiorari. 591 U.\u00a0S. ___\n(2020).IIEnacted in 1976, the Foreign Sovereign\nImmunities Act supplies the ground rules for \u201cobtaining\njurisdiction over a foreign state in the courts of this country.\u201dArgentine Republicv.Amerada Hess Shipping Corp.,488 U.S.\n428, 443 (1989). The Act creates a baseline presumption of\nimmunity from suit. \u00a71604. \u201c[U]nless a specified exception applies,\na federal court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction over a claim\nagainst a foreign state.\u201dSaudi Arabiav.Nelson,507 U.S.\n349, 355 (1993).The heirs contend that their claims fall within\nthe exception for \u201cproperty taken in violation of international\nlaw,\u201d \u00a71605(a)(3), because the coerced sale of the Welfenschatz,\ntheir property, constituted an act of genocide, and genocide is a\nviolation of international human rights law. Germany argues that\nthe exception is inapplicable because the relevant international\nlaw is the international law of property\u2014not the law of\ngenocide\u2014and under the international law of property a foreign\nsovereign\u2019s taking of its own nationals\u2019 property remains a\ndomestic affair. This \u201cdomestic takings rule\u201d assumes that what a\ncountry does to property belonging to its own citizens within its\nown borders is not the subject of international law. SeeBolivarian Republic of Venezuelav.Helmerich & Payne\nInt\u2019l Drilling Co., 581 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip op.,\nat 10) (citing Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations Law of the\nUnited States \u00a7712 (1986) (Restatement (Third))).AKnown at the founding as the \u201claw of nations,\u201d\nwhat we now refer to as international law customarily concerns\nrelations among sovereign states, not relations between states and\nindividuals. SeeBanco Nacional de Cubav.Sabbatino,376 U.S.\n398, 422 (1964) (\u201cThe traditional view of international law is\nthat it establishes substantive principles for determining whether\none country has wronged another.\u201d).The domestic takings rule invoked by Germany\nderives from this premise. Historically, a sovereign\u2019s taking of a\nforeigner\u2019s property, like any injury of a foreign national,\nimplicated the international legal system because it \u201cconstituted\nan injury to the state of the alien\u2019s nationality.\u201d Bradley &\nGoldsmith, Customary International Law as Federal Common Law: A\nCritique of the Modern Position, 110 Harv.\u00a0L.\u00a0Rev. 815,\n831, n.\u00a0106 (1997); see S. Friedman, Expropriation in\nInternational Law 5, 139 (1953). Such mistreatment was an affront\nto the sovereign, and \u201ctherefore the alien\u2019s state alone, and not\nthe individual, could invoke the remedies of international law.\u201d\nBradley,supra,at 831, n.\u00a0106.A domestic\ntaking by contrast did not interfere with relations among states.\nSee E. de Vattel, 3 The Law of Nations \u00a781, p.\u00a0138 (C. Fenwick\ntransl. 1916) (\u201cEven the property of individuals, taken as a whole,\nis to be regarded as the property of the Nation with respect to\nother Nations.\u201d); see alsoUnited Statesv.Belmont,301 U.S.\n324, 332 (1937) (\u201cWhat another country has done in the way of\ntaking over property of its nationals .\u00a0.\u00a0. is not a\nmatter for judicial consideration here.\u201d).The domestic takings rule has deep roots not\nonly in international law but also in United States foreign policy.\nSecretary of State Cordell Hull most famously expressed the\nprinciple in a 1938 letter to the Mexican Ambassador following that\ncountry\u2019s nationalization of American oil fields. The Secretary\nconceded \u201cthe right of a foreign government to treat its own\nnationals in this fashion if it so desires. This is a matter of\ndomestic concern.\u201d Letter from C. Hull to C. N\u00e1jera (July 21,\n1938), reprinted in 5 Foreign Relations of the United States\nDiplomatic Papers 677 (1956). The United States, however, could not\n\u201caccept the idea\u201d that \u201cthese plans can be carried forward at the\nexpense of our citizens.\u201dIbid.The domestic takings rule endured even as\ninternational law increasingly came to be seen as constraining how\nstates interacted not just with other states but also with\nindividuals, including their own citizens. The United Nations\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights and Convention on the\nPrevention of Genocide became part of a growing body of human\nrights law that made \u201chow a state treats individual human beings\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. a matter of international concern.\u201d Bradley,supra, at 832 (quoting Restatement (Third), pt.\u00a0VII,\nIntroductory Note, at 144\u2013145). These human rights documents were\nsilent, however, on the subject of property rights. See Friedman,supra,at 107. International tribunals therefore continued\nto maintain that international law governed \u201cconfiscation of the\nproperty of foreigners,\u201d but \u201cmeasures taken by a State with\nrespect to the property of its own nationals are not subject to\nthese principles.\u201dGudmundssonv.Iceland, Appl. No.\n511/59, 1960 Y. B. Eur. Conv. on H.\u00a0R. 394, 423\u2013424 (decision\nof the European Commission on Human Rights).Some criticized the treatment of property rights\nunder international law, but they did so on the ground thatallsovereign takings were outside the scope of\ninternational law, not just domestic takings. In the 1950s and\n1960s, a growing chorus of newly independent states, particularly\nin Latin America, resisted any foreign restraint on their ability\nto nationalize property. See Young, The Story of Banco Nacional de\nCuba v. Sabbatino, in Federal Courts Stories 422\u2013423 (V. Jackson\n& J. Resnik eds. 2010). Put differently, states and scholars\ndisagreed over whether international law provided a remedy for a\nsovereign\u2019s interference with anyone\u2019s property rights, not whether\ndomestic takings were outside the purview of international law.\nThat principle was beyond debate.We confronted this dispute over the existence of\ninternational law constraints on sovereign takings inSabbatino, where we were asked to decide claims arising out\nof Cuba\u2019s nationalization of American sugar interests in 1960. 376\nU.\u00a0S., at 403. This Court observed that there were \u201cfew if any\nissues in international law today on which opinion seems to be so\ndivided as the limitations on a state\u2019s power to expropriate the\npropertyof aliens.\u201dId.,at 428 (emphasis added).\nHesitant to delve into this controversy, we instead invoked the act\nof state doctrine, which prevents United States courts from\ndetermining the validity of the public acts of a foreign sovereign.Id.,at 436.Congress did not applaud the Court\u2019s reticence.\nWithin months ofSabbatino, it passed the Second\nHickenlooper Amendment to the Foreign Assistance Act of 1964. The\nAmendment prohibits United States courts from applying the act of\nstate doctrine where a \u201cright[\u00a0] to property is asserted\u201d\nbased upon a \u201ctaking .\u00a0.\u00a0. by an act of that state in\nviolation of the principles of international law.\u201d 22\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72370(e)(2). Courts and commentators understood\nthe Amendment to permit adjudication of claims theSabbatinodecision had avoided\u2014claims against foreign nations for\nexpropriation of American-owned property. But nothing in the\nAmendment purported to alter any rule of international law,\nincluding the domestic takings rule. SeeF. Palicio y Compania,\nS.\u00a0A.v.Brush,256 F. Supp. 481, 487 (SDNY 1966) (interpreting the\nHickenlooper Amendment to displaceSabbatinobut dismissing\nthe suit on the ground that \u201cconfiscations by a state of the\nproperty of its own nationals, no matter how flagrant\n.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0, do not constitute violations of\ninternational law\u201d), summarily aff\u00a0\u2019d, 375 F.2d 1011 (CA2\n1967);Banco Nacional de Cubav.Farr, 383 F.2d 166,\n173\u2013176 (CA2 1967); Restatement (Second) of Foreign Relations Law\nof the United States \u00a7185 (1965) (Restatement (Second)); Lillich,\nThe Proper Role of Domestic Courts in the International Legal\nOrder, 11 Va. J. Int\u2019l L. 9, 29, 34 (1970).Congress used language nearly identical to that\nof the Second Hickenlooper Amendment 12 years later in crafting the\nFSIA\u2019s expropriation exception. As noted, it provides that United\nStates courts may exercise jurisdiction over a foreign sovereign in\nany case \u201cin which rights in property taken in violation of\ninternational law are in issue.\u201d 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a71605(a)(3).Based on this historical and legal background,\ncourts arrived at a \u201cconsensus\u201d that the expropriation exception\u2019s\n\u201creference to \u2018violation of international law\u2019 does not cover\nexpropriations of property belonging to a country\u2019s own nationals.\u201dRepublic of Austriav.Altmann,541 U.S.\n677, 713 (2004) (Breyer, J., concurring).BThe heirs urge us to change course. They read\n\u201crights in property taken in violation of international law\u201d not as\nan invocation of the international law governing property rights,\nbut as a broad incorporation of any international norm. Focusing on\nhuman rights law, the heirs rely on the United Nations Convention\non Genocide, which defines genocide as \u201cdeliberately inflicting on\n[a] group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical\ndestruction in whole or in part.\u201d Convention on the Prevention and\nPunishment of the Crime of Genocide, Art.\u00a0II, Dec. 9, 1948, 78\nU.\u00a0N.\u00a0T.\u00a0S. 277, 280. According to the heirs, the\nforced sale of their ancestors\u2019 art constituted an act of genocide\nbecause the confiscation of property was one of the conditions the\nThird Reich inflicted on the Jewish population to bring about their\ndestruction.We need not decide whether the sale of the\nconsortium\u2019s property was an act of genocide, because the\nexpropriation exception is best read as referencing the\ninternational law of expropriation rather than of human rights. We\ndo not look to the law of genocide to determine if we have\njurisdiction over the heirs\u2019 common law property claims. We look to\nthe law of property.And in 1976, the state of that body of law was\nclear: A \u201ctaking of property\u201d could be \u201cwrongful under\ninternational law\u201d only where a state deprived \u201can alien\u201d of\nproperty. Restatement (Second) \u00a7185; see alsoPermanent Mission\nof India to United Nationsv.City of New York,551 U.S.\n193, 199\u2013200 (2007) (noting our consistent practice of\ninterpreting the FSIA in keeping with \u201cinternational law at the\ntime of the FSIA\u2019s enactment\u201d and looking to the contemporary\nRestatement for guidance). As explained above, this rule survived\nthe advent of modern human rights law, including the United Nations\nConvention on Genocide. Congress drafted the expropriation\nexception and its predecessor, the Hickenlooper Amendment, against\nthat legal and historical backdrop. SeeTaggartv.Lorenzen, 587 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2019) (slip op., at\n5).The heirs concede that at the time of the FSIA\u2019s\nenactment the international law of expropriation retained the\ndomestic takings rule. See Restatement (Second) \u00a7192. But they\nargue that Congress captured all of international law in the\nexception\u2014not just the international law of expropriation\u2014and that\nother areas of international law do not shield a sovereign\u2019s\nactions against its own nationals. In support of that assertion,\nthey note that the exception concerns \u201cpropertytakenin\nviolation of international law\u201d\u2014not \u201cpropertytakingsin\nviolation of international law.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 70. This\ndistinction between \u201ctakings\u201d and \u201ctaken,\u201d they say, is the\ndifference between incorporating the specific international law\ngoverning takings of property and incorporating international law\nwrit large.Ibid.We would not place so much weight on a gerund.\nThe text of the expropriation exception as a whole supports\nGermany\u2019s reading. In its entirety the clause provides that United\nStates courts may exercise jurisdiction over a foreign sovereign in\nany case\u201cin which rights in property taken in\nviolation of international law are in issue and that property or\nany property exchanged for such property is present in the United\nStates in connection with a commercial activity carried on in the\nUnited States by the foreign state; or that property or any\nproperty exchanged for such property is owned or operated by an\nagency or instrumentality of the foreign state and that agency or\ninstrumentality is engaged in a commercial activity in the United\nStates.\u201d 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71605(a)(3).The exception places repeated emphasis on\nproperty and property-related rights, while injuries and acts we\nmight associate with genocide are notably lacking. That would be\nremarkable if the provision were intended to provide relief for\natrocities such as the Holocaust. A statutory phrase concerning\nproperty rights most sensibly references the international law\ngoverning property rights, rather than the law of genocide.What is more, the heirs\u2019 interpretation of the\nphrase \u201ctaken in violation of international law\u201d is not limited to\nviolations of the law of genocide but extends to any human rights\nabuse. Their construction would arguably force courts themselves to\nviolate international law, not only ignoring the domestic takings\nrule but also derogating international law\u2019s preservation of\nsovereign immunity for violations of human rights law. As the\nInternational Court of Justice recently ruled when considering\nclaims brought by descendants of citizens of Nazi-occupied\ncountries, \u201ca State is not deprived of immunity by reason of the\nfact that it is accused of serious violations of international\nhuman rights law.\u201dJurisdictional Immunities of the State(Germanyv.Italy), 2012 I.\u00a0C.\u00a0J. 99, 139\n(Judgt. of Feb. 3); see also Bradley & Goldsmith, Foreign\nSovereign Immunity, Individual Officials, and Human Rights\nLitigation, 13 Green Bag\u00a02d 9, 21 (2009). Respondents would\noverturn that rule whenever a violation of international human\nrights law is accompanied by a taking of property.Germany\u2019s interpretation of the exception is\nalso more consistent with the FSIA\u2019s express goal of codifying the\nrestrictive theory of sovereign immunity. \u00a71602. Under the absolute\nor classical theory of sovereign immunity, foreign sovereigns are\ncategorically immune from suit.Altmann, 541 U.\u00a0S., at\n690.Under the restrictive view, by contrast, immunity\nextends to a sovereign\u2019s public but not its private acts.Ibid. Most of the FSIA\u2019s exceptions, such as the exception\nfor \u201ccommercial activity carried on in the United States,\u201d comport\nwith the overarching framework of the restrictive theory.\n\u00a71605(a)(2).It is true that the expropriation exception,\nbecause it permits the exercise of jurisdiction over some public\nacts of expropriation, goes beyond even the restrictive view. In\nthis way, the exception is unique; no other country has adopted a\ncomparable limitation on sovereign immunity. Restatement (Fourth)\nof Foreign Relations Law of the United States \u00a7455, Reporters\u2019 Note\n15 (2017).History and context explain this nonconformity.\nAs events such as Secretary Hull\u2019s letter and the Second\nHickenlooper Amendment demonstrate, the United States has long\nsought to protect the property of its citizens abroad as part of a\ndefense of America\u2019s free enterprise system.Sabbatino, 376\nU.\u00a0S., at 430.Given that the FSIA \u201clargely codifies\u201d the\nrestrictive theory, however, we take seriously the Act\u2019s general\neffort to preserve a dichotomy between private and public acts.Nelson, 507 U.\u00a0S., at 359 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). It would destroy that distinction were we to subject all\nmanner of sovereign public acts to judicial scrutiny under the FSIA\nby transforming the expropriation exception into an all-purpose\njurisdictional hook for adjudicating human rights violations. SeeHelmerich, 581 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 9)\n(rejecting the suggestion that Congress intended the expropriation\nexception to operate as a \u201cradical departure\u201d from the \u201cbasic\nprinciples\u201d of the restrictive theory).COther provisions of the FSIA confirm Germany\u2019s\nposition. The heirs\u2019 approach, for example, would circumvent the\nreticulated boundaries Congress placed in the FSIA with regard to\nhuman rights violations. Where Congress did target injuries\nassociated with such acts, including torture or death, it did so\nexplicitly and with precision. The noncommercial tort exception\nprovides jurisdiction over claims \u201cin which money damages are\nsought against a foreign state for personal injury or death, or\ndamage to or loss of property,\u201d but only where the relevant conduct\n\u201coccurr[ed] in the United States.\u201d \u00a71605(a)(5). Similarly, the\nterrorism exception eliminates sovereign immunity for state\nsponsors of terrorism but only for certain human rights claims,\nbrought by certain victims, against certain defendants. \u00a7\u00a71605A(a),\n(h).These restrictions would be of little\nconsequence if human rights abuses could be packaged as violations\nof property rights and thereby brought within the expropriation\nexception to sovereign immunity. And there is no reason to suppose\nCongress thought acts of genocide or other human rights violations\nto be especially deserving of redress only when accompanied by\ninfringement of property rights. We have previously rejected\nefforts to insert modern human rights law into FSIA exceptions ill\nsuited to the task.Nelson, 507 U.\u00a0S., at 361\n(commercial activity exception does not encompass claims that\nforeign state illegally detained and tortured United States\ncitizen, \u201chowever monstrous such abuse undoubtedly may be\u201d). We do\nso again today.We have recognized that \u201c\u00a0\u2018United States\nlaw governs domestically but does not rule the world.\u2019\u00a0\u201dKiobelv.Royal Dutch Petroleum Co.,569 U.S.\n108, 115 (2013) (quotingMicrosoft Corp.v.AT&T\nCorp.,550 U.S.\n437, 454 (2007)). We interpret the FSIA as we do other statutes\naffecting international relations: to avoid, where possible,\n\u201cproducing friction in our relations with [other] nations and\nleading some to reciprocate by granting their courts permission to\nembroil the United States in expensive and difficult litigation.\u201dHelmerich, 581 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12) (internal\nquotation marks omitted);RJR Nabisco,Inc.v.European Community, 579 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___\u2013___ (2016) (slip\nop., at 7\u20138) (interpreting civil Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt\nOrganizations Act \u201cto avoid the international discord that can\nresult when U.\u00a0S. law is applied to conduct in foreign\ncountries\u201d);Kiobel, 569 U.\u00a0S., at 116 (interpreting\nAlien Tort Statute so as not to \u201cadopt an interpretation of\nU.\u00a0S. law that carries foreign policy consequences not clearly\nintended by the political branches\u201d).As a Nation, we would be surprised\u2014and might\neven initiate reciprocal action\u2014if a court in Germany adjudicated\nclaims by Americans that they were entitled to hundreds of millions\nof dollars because of human rights violations committed by the\nUnited States Government years ago. There is no reason to\nanticipate that Germany\u2019s reaction would be any different were\nAmerican courts to exercise the jurisdiction claimed in this\ncase.IIIThe heirs offer several counterarguments, but\nnone can overcome the text, context, and history of the\nexpropriation exception.First, the heirs rely on the 2016 Foreign\nCultural Exchange Jurisdictional Immunity Clarification Act. The\nAct amends the FSIA to explain that participation in specified \u201cart\nexhibition activities\u201d does not qualify as \u201ccommercial activity\u201d\nwithin the meaning of the expropriation exception. 28\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71605(h). This clarification responded to\ndecisions of federal courts holding to the contrary, see,e.g.,Malewiczv.Amsterdam, 362 F. Supp. 2d\n298, 313\u2013315 (DC 2005), and enables foreign states to loan art to\nAmerican museums without fear that the work\u2019s presence in the\nUnited States will subject them to litigation here. The provision,\nhowever, does not apply to claims brought against Germany arising\nout of the period from January 1933 through May 1945. \u00a7\u00a71605(h)(2),\n(3).According to the heirs, this clarification of the\nexpropriation exception shows that Congress anticipated Nazi-era\nclaims could be adjudicated by way of that exception.We agree with the heirs, but only to a limited\nextent. Claims concerning Nazi-era art takings could be brought\nunder the expropriation exception where the claims involve the\ntaking of aforeignnational\u2019s property. See,e.g.,Altmann, 541 U.\u00a0S., at 680\u2013682 (claim concerning\nAustrian taking of Czechoslovakian national\u2019s art brought under the\nexpropriation exception). As for the heirs\u2019 suggestion that the\nClarification Act demonstrates that Congress meant to abrogate\nimmunity for any Nazi-era claim, however, we do not interpret\nCongress\u2019s effort topreservesovereign immunity in a\nnarrow, particularized context\u2014art shows\u2014as supporting the broadeliminationof sovereign immunity across all areas of law.\nThe Clarification Act did not purport to amend the critical phrase\nhere\u2014\u201ctaken in violation of international law\u201d\u2014and we will not\nconstrue it to do so.The heirs also rely on other statutes aimed at\npromoting restitution to the victims of the Holocaust. The Acts\ninclude the Holocaust Victims Redress Act of 1998, 112Stat. 15; the\nHolocaust Expropriated Art Recovery Act of 2016 (HEAR Act),\n130Stat. 1524; and the Justice for Uncompensated Survivors Today\n(JUST) Act of 2017, Pub.\u00a0L. 115\u2013171, 132Stat. 1288. These\nlaws, the heirs suggest, demonstrate Congress\u2019s desire for American\ncourts to hear disputes about Holocaust-era property claims.The statutes do promote restitution for the\nvictims of the Holocaust, but they generally encourage redressing\nthose injuries outside of public court systems. The HEAR Act, for\nexample, states that \u201cthe use of alternative dispute resolution\u201d\nmechanisms will \u201cyield just and fair resolutions in a more\nefficient and predictable manner\u201d than litigation in court. \u00a72(8),\n130Stat. 1525. Germany has adopted just such an alternative\nmechanism, the Advisory Commission, and the heirs availed\nthemselves of that opportunity to resolve their claims.Ibid.See also Brief for Petitioners 5 (\u201c[T]he German\ngovernment has provided roughly $100 billion (in today\u2019s dollars)\nto compensate Holocaust survivors and other victims of the Nazi\nera.\u201d).These laws do not speak to sovereign immunity.\nThat is the province of the FSIA, which provides the carefully\nconstructed framework necessary for addressing an issue of such\ninternational concern. The heirs have not shown that the FSIA\nallows them to bring their claims against Germany. We cannot permit\nthem to bypass its design.IVWe hold that the phrase \u201crights in property\ntaken in violation of international law,\u201d as used in the FSIA\u2019s\nexpropriation exception, refers to violations of the international\nlaw of expropriation and thereby incorporates the domestic takings\nrule.We do not address Germany\u2019s argument that the\nDistrict Court was obligated to abstain from deciding the case on\ninternational comity grounds. Nor do we consider an alternative\nargument noted by the heirs: that the sale of the Welfenschatz is\nnot subject to the domestic takings rule because the consortium\nmembers were not German nationals at the time of the transaction.\nSee Brief for Respondents 27\u201328; but see Brief for Petitioners 19,\nn. 7 (claiming that the heirs forfeited this argument). The Court\nof Appeals should direct the District Court to consider this\nargument, including whether it was adequately preserved below.The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the\nD.\u00a0C. Circuit is vacated, and the case is remanded for further\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.",
