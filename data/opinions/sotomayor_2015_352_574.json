    "text": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES_________________No. 13\u20136827_________________GREGORY HOUSTON HOLT, aka ABDUL MAALIK MUHAMMAD, PETITIONERv.RAY HOBBS, DIRECTOR, ARKANSAS DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTION,\net\u00a0al.on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for\nthe eighth circuit[January 20, 2015]Justice Sotomayor, concurring.I concur in the Court\u2019s opinion, which holds that the Department\nfailed to show why the less restrictive al-ternatives identified by\npetitioner in the course of this litigation were inadequate to\nachieve the Department\u2019s compelling security-related interests. I\nwrite separatelyto explain my understanding of the applicable\nlegalstandard.Nothing in the Court\u2019s opinion calls into question our prior\nholding inCutterv.Wilkinsonthat \u201c[c]ontext\nmatters\u201d in the application of the Religious Land Use and\nInstitutionalized Persons Act of 2000 (RLUIPA),114Stat.803,42\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72000ccet\u00a0seq.544 U.\u00a0S.\n709,723 (2005) (internal quotation marks omitted). In the dangerous\nprison environment, \u201cregulations and procedures\u201d are needed to\n\u201cmaintain good order, security and discipline, consistent with\nconsideration of costs and limited resources.\u201dIbid.Of\ncourse, that is not to say that cost alone is an absolute defense\nto an otherwise meritorious RLUIPA claim. See \u00a72000cc\u20133(c). Thus,\nwe recognized \u201cthat prison security is a compelling state interest,\nand that deference is due to institutional officials\u2019 expertise in\nthis area.\u201dCutter,544 U.\u00a0S., at 725, n.\u00a013.I do not understand the Court\u2019s opinion to preclude deferring to\nprison officials\u2019 reasoning when that deference is due\u2014that is,\nwhen prison officials offer a plausible explanation for their\nchosen policy that is supported by whatever evidence is reasonably\navailable to them. But the deference that must be \u201cextend[ed to]\nthe experience and expertise of prison administrators does not\nextend so far that prison officials may declare a compelling\ngovernmental interest by fiat.\u201dYellowbearv.Lampert, 741 F.\u00a03d 48, 59 (CA10 2014). Indeed, prison\npolicies \u201c\u00a0\u2018grounded on mere speculation\u2019\u00a0\u201d are exactly\nthe ones that motivated Congress to enact RLUIPA.106 Cong.\nRec. 16699 (2000) (quoting S.\u00a0Rep. No. 103\u2013111, 10\n(1993)).Here, the Department\u2019s failure to demonstrate why the less\nrestrictive policies petitioner identified in the course of the\nlitigation were insufficient to achieve its compelling\ninterests\u2014not the Court\u2019s independent judgment concerning the merit\nof these alternative approaches\u2014is ultimately fatal to the\nDepartment\u2019s position. The Court is appro-priately skeptical of the\nrelationship between the De-partment\u2019s no-beard policy and its\nalleged compelling interests because the Department offered little\nmore than unsupported assertions in defense of its refusal of\npetitioner\u2019s requested religious accommodation. RLUIPA requires\nmore.One final point bears emphasis. RLUIPA requires institutions\nrefusing an accommodation to demonstrate that the policy it defends\n\u201cis the least restrictive means of furthering [the alleged]\ncompelling .\u00a0.\u00a0. interest[s].\u201d \u00a72000cc\u20131(a)(2); see alsoWashingtonv.Klem, 497 F.\u00a03d 272, 284 (CA3\n2007) (\u201c[T]he phrase \u2018least restrictive means\u2019 is, by definition, a\nrelative term. It necessarily implies a comparison with other\nmeans\u201d);Couchv.Jabe, 679 F.\u00a03d 197, 203 (CA4\n2012) (same). But nothing in the Court\u2019s opinion suggests that\nprison officials must refute every conceivable option to satisfy\nRLUIPA\u2019s least restrictive means requirement. Nor does it intimate\nthat officials must prove that they considered less restrictive\nalternatives at a particular point in time. Instead, the Court\ncorrectly notes that the Department inadequately responded to the\nless restrictive policies that petitioner brought to the\nDepartment\u2019s attention during the course of the litigation,\nincluding the more permissive policies used by the prisons in New\nYork and California. See,e.g.,United Statesv.Wilgus, 638 F.\u00a03d 1274, 1289 (CA10 2011) (observing in\nthe analogous context of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of\n1993 that the government need not \u201cdo the impossible\u2014refute each\nand every conceivable alternative regulation scheme\u201d but need only\n\u201crefute the alternative schemes offered by the challenger\u201d).Because I understand the Court\u2019s opinion to be consistent with\nthe foregoing, I join it.",
