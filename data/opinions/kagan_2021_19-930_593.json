We hold that the Act does not preclude the\nsuit.IAmericans have never had much enthusiasm for\npaying taxes. The Nation\u2019s first income taxes\u2014adopted to finance\nthe Civil War\u2014met with considerable (one might even say \u201ctaxing\u201d)\nlegal resistance. See Hickman & Kerska, Restoring the Lost\nAnti-Injunction Act, 103 Va. L. Rev. 1683, 1723\u20131725 (2017). Some\ntaxpayers, alleging the taxes illegal, sought to enjoin collection\nefforts. And some courts granted the requested relief. See,e.g.,Robackv.Taylor, 20 F. Cas. 852, 854\n(No. 11,877) (CC SD\u00a0Ohio 1866);Bank for Savingsv.Collector, 3 Wall. 495 (1866). Those rulings disrupted the\nflow of revenue to the Federal Government. As one late-19th century\ntreatise writer described the problem, \u201cimprovident employment of\nthe writ of injunction\u201d threatened to \u201cseriously embarrass\u201d\ntax-dependent \u201coperations of the government.\u201d T. Cooley, Law of\nTaxation 536\u2013537 (2d ed. 1886).Congress responded by enacting the\nAnti-Injunction Act. See Act of Mar. 2, 1867, \u00a710, 14Stat. 475. In\nits current form (differing little from the original), the Act\nprovides: \u201c[N]o suit for the purpose of restraining the assessment\nor collection of any tax shall be maintained in any court by any\nperson.\u201d 26 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a77421(a). The Act, we have stated,\n\u201cprotects the [Federal] Government\u2019s ability to collect a\nconsistent stream of revenue, by barring litigation to enjoin or\notherwise obstruct the collection of taxes.\u201dNational Federation\nof Independent Businessv.Sebelius,567 U.S.\n519, 543 (2012) (NFIB). Because of the Act, a person can\ntypically challenge a federal tax only after he pays it, by suing\nfor a refund. Seeibid.In an ordinary Anti-Injunction Act case, that\nshort primer on the statute would naturally bring us to a\ndescription of the tax under dispute. But describing the tax\nimplicated here will have to wait. For that tax\u2014the thing that\nraises the Anti-Injunction Act question\u2014comes into play only at the\nback end of a complex information-reporting scheme. The reporting\nscheme itself is where we must begin.As every taxpayer knows, the Internal Revenue\nService (IRS) has broad power to require the submission of tax-\nrelated information that it believes helpful in assessing and\ncollecting taxes. See \u00a76011(a). Those reporting rules may apply not\njust to taxpayers but also to \u201cmaterial advisors\u201d\u2014individuals or\nentities that earn income from providing taxpayers with certain\nkinds of \u201caid, assistance, or advice.\u201d \u00a76111(b)(1)(A); see\n\u00a76111(a). This case starts with requirements that taxpayers and\nmaterial advisors provide detailed information about what the\nInternal Revenue Code calls \u201creportable transaction[s].\u201d\n\u00a76707A(c)(1). The Code describes those transactions simply as ones\nthat \u201chav[e] a potential for tax avoidance or evasion.\u201dIbid.Rather than give further specifics, the Code delegates\nto the Secretary of the Treasury, acting through the IRS, the task\nof identifying particular transactions with the requisite risk of\ntax abuse. See \u00a7\u00a76011, 6707A(c)(1).Using that authority, the IRS determined that\nso-called micro-captive transactions must be reported because of\ntheir potential for tax evasion. A micro-captive transaction is\ntypically an insurance agreement between a parent company and a\n\u201ccaptive\u201d insurer under its control. The Code provides the parties\nto such an agreement with tax advantages. The insured party can\ndeduct its premium payments as business expenses. See \u00a7162(a). And\nthe insurer can exclude up to $2.2 million of those premiums from\nits own taxable income, under a tax break for small insurance\ncompanies. See \u00a7831(b). The result is that the money does not get\ntaxed at all. That much, for better or worse, is a congressional\nchoice. But no tax benefit should accrue if the money is not really\nfor insurance\u2014if the insurance contract is a sham, which the\naffiliated companies have entered into only to escape tax\nliability. And according to the IRS, some micro-captive\ntransactions are of that kind. So the IRS issued Notice 2016\u201366\nidentifying certain micro-captive agreements as reportable\ntransactions. See 2016\u201347 Cum. Bull. 745. That Notice compels\ntaxpayers and material advisors associated with such an agreement\nto (among other things) \u201cdescribe the transaction in sufficient\ndetail for the IRS to be able to understand [its] tax structure.\u201dId., at 748. With that information, the IRS can check for\nfacts\u2014like coverage for an \u201cimplausible risk\u201d or premiums that\n\u201csignificantly exceed\u201d prevailing rates\u2014suggesting that the\ntaxpayer is not entitled to the tax benefit it claims.Id.,at 745\u2013746.Noncompliance with Notice 2016\u201366 subjects a\ntaxpayer or material advisor to stiff penalties\u2014at last bringing us\nto the tax involved in this case, as well as to non-tax criminal\nconsequences. By statutory provision, all failures to supply\nrequired information on reportable transactions, including the\nmicro-captive transactions specified in the Notice, are punishable\nby civil monetary penalties\u2014$50,000 for advisors and up to that\namount (depending on the amount of tax gain realized) for\ntaxpayers. See \u00a7\u00a76707(b), 6707A(b). In addition, an advisor may\nincur a daily $10,000 penalty for failing to furnish, on request, a\nlist of the people it advised on a reportable transaction. See\n\u00a7\u00a76708(a), 6112(a). And critically here, all those penalties are\n\u201cdeemed\u201d to be \u201ctax[es]\u201d for purposes of the Code\u2014including the\nAnti- Injunction Act. \u00a76671(a). So, again, the civil penalties for\nviolating Notice 2016\u201366 aretaxpenalties, and must be\ntreated as such. But no sooner do we find the tax appended to the\nNotice\u2019s reporting scheme than we encounter something else. Under\nthe Code, any person who \u201cwillfully\u201d breaches an IRS reporting\nrequirement is also subject to criminal penalties. \u00a77203. Such a\nviolation is a misdemeanor, punishable by fines and up to one year\nin prison. And, unsurprisingly, that criminal liability is not\n\u201cdeemed\u201d a tax.This suit challenges the lawfulness of Notice\n2016\u201366. The petitioner is CIC Services, a material advisor to\ntaxpayers participating in microcaptive transactions. It brought\nthis action before the Notice\u2019s first reporting date, rather than\nafter a reporting violation, let alone payment of penalty. (As far\nas we know, CIC has still not committed a violation, instead\ncomplying with the Notice while pressing this suit.) CIC\u2019s\ncomplaint mainly asserts that the IRS violated the Administrative\nProcedure Act (APA) by issuing the Notice without\nnotice-and-comment procedures. The complaint also alleges that the\nNotice is arbitrary and capricious under the APA because it imposes\nnew reporting requirements without proven need. So the complaint\nasks the court to \u201cset[\u2009] aside IRS Notice 2016\u201366\u201d\u2014more\nspecifically, to \u201cenjoin the enforcement of Notice 2016\u201366 as an\nunlawful IRS rule\u201d and to \u201cdeclar[e] that Notice 2016\u201366 is\nunlawful.\u201d Complaint in No. 17\u2013CV\u2013110 (ED Tenn., Mar. 27, 2017),\nDoc. 1, pp. 2, 16 (Complaint).But the suit has not yet proceeded to the\nmerits. The Government moved to dismiss the action based on the\nAnti-Injunction Act, arguing that CIC\u2019s \u201crequested relief would\nprevent the IRS from assessing a tax penalty against material\nadvisors\u201d that disregard the Notice\u2019s reporting requirements.\nMotion to Dismiss in No. 17\u2013cv\u2013110 (ED Tenn., May 30, 2017), Doc.\n25\u20131, p. 9. In the Government\u2019s view, the way for CIC to bring its\nclaims is to disobey the Notice and then sue for a refund of any\nresulting tax penalty. The District Court agreed. It reasoned that\nCIC\u2019s suit sought \u201cto restrain the IRS\u2019s assessment or collection\u201d\nof the tax penalty that could be imposed for noncompliance. 2017 WL\n5015510, *4 (ED Tenn., Nov. 2, 2017). The Court of Appeals for the\nSixth Circuit affirmed in a divided decision. According to the\nmajority, CIC\u2019s suit would \u201crestrain (indeed eliminate)\u201d the tax\npenalty by \u201cinvalidat[ing] the Notice, which is [that tax\u2019s] entire\nbasis.\u201d 925 F.3d 247, 255 (2019). Judge Nalbandian dissented.\n\u201c[T]his is not,\u201d he wrote, \u201ca dispute over taxes\u201d: \u201c[A] suit to\nenjoin the enforcement of areporting requirementis not\u201d\none to restrain a tax\u2019s collection.Id., at 259\u2013260. Under\nthe majority\u2019s view, the dissent also objected, CIC could challenge\nthe reporting scheme only by \u201cviolat[ing] the law\u201d and risking\n\u201ccriminal prosecution.\u201dId., at 263. The Sixth Circuit\ndenied a petition for rehearing en banc, over a dissent from seven\njudges.We granted certiorari, 590 U.\u00a0S. ___\n(2020), and now reverse.IIAThe issue here, most concretely stated, is\nwhether the Anti-Injunction Act bars CIC\u2019s suit complaining that\nNotice 2016\u201366\u2019s reporting requirements violate the APA. Once\nagain, the Anti-Injunction Act provides, with exceptions not\nrelevant here, that \u201cno suit for the purpose of restraining the\nassessment or collection of any tax shall be maintained in any\ncourt by any person.\u201d \u00a77421(a). If CIC\u2019s suit is not for that\npurpose, it can go forward. If the suit is for that purpose, it\nmust be dismissed. In that event, CIC could contest the legality of\nthe reporting rules only by violating them and suing for a refund\nof a later tax penalty.If that downstream tax penalty did not exist,\nthis case would be a cinch: The Anti-Injunction Act would not apply\nand the suit could proceed. A reporting requirement is not a tax;\nand a suit brought to set aside such a rule is not one to enjoin a\ntax\u2019s assessment or collection. That is so even if the reporting\nrule will help the IRS bring in future tax revenue\u2014here, by\nidentifying sham insurance transactions. Seesupra,at 3. We\nsaid as much inDirect Marketing Assn.v.Brohl, 575\nU.S. 1 (2015).[1] In that case,\nout-of-state retailers wanted to invalidate a Colorado law\nrequiring them to report to the State\u2019s Department of Revenue any\nsale to a state resident on which they had not collected tax. We\nallowed the suit to proceed, explaining that a suit about reporting\nrequirements is not about the \u201cassessment\u201d or \u201ccollection\u201d of\ntaxes.Id., at 9\u201310. \u201cInformation gathering,\u201d we stated, is\n\u201ca phase of tax administration procedure that occurs before\nassessment [or] collection.\u201dId., at 8. And it did not\nmatter that the reporting requirements would \u201cfacilitate collection\nof taxes\u201d\u2014there, by identifying residents who owed sales taxes.Id., at 12. The statute\u2019s limit on injunctions, we said, is\n\u201cnot keyed to all activities that may improve a State\u2019s ability to\nassess and collect taxes.\u201dId., at 11. It is instead \u201ckeyed\nto the acts of assessment [and] collection themselves.\u201dId.,at 12. That means a suit directed at ordinary reporting duties can\ngo forward, unimpeded by the Anti-Injunction Act. On this much,\neven the Government agrees. See Brief for Respondents 27.The complication here is that Notice 2016\u201366\u2019s\nreporting obligations (unlike those inDirect Marketing) are\nbacked up by a statutory tax penalty. As earlier described, the\nCode provides that a taxpayer who violates a demand for information\nabout a reportable transaction\u2014including those specified in the\nNotice\u2014is subject to civil monetary penalties. Seesupra,at\n3\u20134. And the Code \u201cdeem[s]\u201d those civil penalties to be \u201ctax[es]\u201d\nas the Anti-Injunction Act uses that term. \u00a76671(a); seeNFIB, 567 U.\u00a0S., at 544 (\u201cCongress can, of course,\u201d\ndirect that a penalty \u201cbe treated as a tax for purposes of the\nAntiInjunction Act\u201d). The question thus becomes whether that added\ntax penalty changes the analysis. Does its presence\u2014as a sanction\nfor flouting the Notice\u2014mean that CIC\u2019s suit is, as the\nAnti-Injunction Act provides, \u201cfor the purpose of restraining the\nassessment or collection of any tax\u201d?In considering a \u201csuit[\u2019s] purpose,\u201d we inquire\nnot into a taxpayer\u2019s subjective motive, but into the action\u2019s\nobjective aim\u2014essentially, the relief the suit requests. The\nparties agree on that interpretation, as both consistent with the\nAct\u2019s ordinary meaning and necessary for the Act\u2019s administration.\nSee Brief for Respondents 40; Reply Brief 4; Tr. of Oral Arg. 15,\n34. The purpose of a measure is \u201cthe end or aim to which [it] is\ndirected.\u201d N. Webster, An American Dictionary of the English\nLanguage (rev. ed. 1844); see Webster\u2019s Third New International\nDictionary 1847 (1976). And in this context, that aim is not best\nassessed by probing an individual taxpayer\u2019s innermost reasons for\nsuing. Down that path lies too much potential for circumventing the\nAct. Instead, this Court has looked to the face of the taxpayer\u2019s\ncomplaint. See,e.g.,Bob Jones Univ.v.Simon,416 U.S.\n725, 738 (1974). We have asked about what the Government here\ncalls \u201cthe substance of the suit\u201d\u2014the claims brought and injuries\nalleged\u2014to determine the suit\u2019s object. Brief for Respondents 40.\nAnd most especially, we have looked to the \u201crelief requested\u201d\u2014the\nthing sought to be enjoined.Alexanderv.\u201cAmericans\nUnited\u201d Inc.,416 U.S.\n752, 761 (1974); seeBob Jones, 416 U.\u00a0S., at 732\n(\u201c[A] suit seeking [injunctive] relief\u00a0\u201d against a tax \u201cfalls\nsquarely within the literal scope of the Act\u201d). The Anti-\nInjunction Act kicks in when the target of a requested injunction\nis a tax obligation\u2014or stated in the Act\u2019s language, when that\ninjunction runs against the \u201ccollection or assessment of [a]\ntax.\u201dIt is in characterizing the purpose of CIC\u2019s\nsuit that the parties\u2019 disagreement emerges. Recall that CIC\u2019s\ncomplaint avers that Notice 2016\u201366 violates the APA. Seesupra,at 4\u20135. And the complaint describes the relief\nrequested as \u201csetting aside IRS Notice 2016\u201366,\u201d \u201cenjoin[ing] the\nenforcement of Notice 2016\u201366 as an unlawful IRS rule,\u201d and\n\u201cdeclaring that Notice 2016\u201366 is unlawful.\u201d Complaint 2, 16.\nAccording to CIC, all of that reveals the suit\u2019s aim as\ninvalidating the Notice and thereby eliminating its onerous\nreporting requirements\u2014not as blocking the downstream tax penalty\nthat may sanction the Notice\u2019s breach. See Reply Brief 6. By\ncontrast, the Government contends that the suit\u2019s purpose is to\nstop the collection of the tax itself. See Brief for Respondents\n12. In making that claim, the Government picks up on the word\n\u201cenforcement\u201d in CIC\u2019s request for relief: Because the Notice is\nenforced through tax penalties, the Government claims, \u201cenjoin[ing]\nthe [Notice\u2019s] enforcement,\u201d as CIC wants, means preventing the IRS\nfrom collecting taxes.Id., at 23, 37\u201338. And even putting\naside that word, the Government insists that there is no real\ndifference between a suit to invalidate the Notice and one to\npreclude the tax penalty. Seeid., at 38; Tr. of Oral Arg.\n54\u201356. Avoiding the burdens of compliance with the Notice and\navoiding the tax that sanctions noncompliance, the Government\nasserts, are \u201ctwo sides of the same coin.\u201d Brief for Respondents\n37. The Government thus suggests that by framing this suit as an\nattack on the Notice, CIC is trying to \u201ceva[de] the Anti-Injunction\nAct through artful pleading.\u201dId., at 38.To begin with, we agree with CIC\u2019s reading of\nits complaint. The complaint contests the legality of Notice\n2016\u201366, not of the statutory tax penalty that serves as one way to\nenforce it. CIC alleges that the Notice is procedurally and\nsubstantively flawed; it brings no legal claim against the separate\nstatutory tax. And CIC\u2019s complaint asks for injunctive relief from\nthe Notice\u2019s reporting rules, not from any impending or eventual\ntax obligation. Contra the Government\u2019s view, a request in an APA\naction to \u201cenjoin the enforcement\u201d of an IRS reporting rule is most\nnaturally understood as a request to \u201cset aside\u201d that rule (as the\ncomplaint elsewhere says), not to block the application of a\npenalty that might be imposed for some yet-to-happen violation. 5\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7706; Complaint 2, 9, 16. Indeed, CIC\u2019s\ncomplaint barely mentions that penalty. The complaint, and\nparticularly its request for relief, sets out this suit\u2019s purpose\nas enjoining the Notice.And we reject the Government\u2019s argument that an\ninjunction against the Notice is the same as one against the tax\npenalty\u2014just \u201ctwo sides of the same coin.\u201d Brief for Respondents\n37. If that view were right, of course, no amount of artful\npleading would avail: CIC\u2019s suit targeting the Notice would then in\nfact target the tax, and the Anti- Injunction Act would apply. But\nthe Government\u2019s take is wrong. Three aspects of the regulatory\nscheme here, taken in combination, refute the idea that this is a\ntax action in disguise. They show that in addressing Notice\n2016\u201366, this suit (and any resulting injunction) addresses\nsomething other than the tax penalty helping to back it up.First, the Notice imposes affirmative reporting\nobligations, inflicting costs separate and apart from the statutory\ntax penalty. As described earlier, the Notice levies no tax.\nRather, it compels taxpayers and their material advisors to collect\nand submit detailed information about micro-captive transactions\nand their participants. Seesupra,at 3. And obeying that\nmandate is likely to involve significant time and expense. Here,\nfor example, CIC estimates that it will have to spend \u201chundreds of\nhours of labor and in excess of $60,000 per year\u201d to comply with\nthe Notice. See Complaint \u00b640. Costs of that kind may well exceed,\nor even dwarf, the tax penalties for a violation. So in bringing\nthis suit, CIC challenges a regulatory mandate that (1) is not a\ntax and (2) entails compliance costs whose amount is not tied to,\nand often goes beyond, any tax. Simply stated, this suit attempts\nto get out from under the (non-tax) burdens of a (non-tax)\nreporting obligation. Of course, if the suit succeeds, CIC will\nnever have to worry about the tax penalty; once the reporting duty\ndisappears, the sanction becomes irrelevant. But that is the suit\u2019s\nafter-effect, not its substance. The suit still targets the\nreporting mandates\u2014the independently onerous reporting mandates\u2014of\nthe Notice itself.Second and relatedly, the Notice\u2019s reporting\nrule and the statutory tax penalty are several steps removed from\neach other. Consider what has to happen before CIC owes taxes to\nthe IRS. To start, CIC has to withhold required information about a\nmicro-captive transaction that the Notice covers. (And note, for\nwhatever it is worth, that CIC disclaims any intent to do so while\nthe Notice remains the law. See Brief for Petitioner 29.) Next, the\nIRS must determine (often no small matter) that a violation of the\nNotice has in fact occurred. And finally, the IRS must make\nthe\u2014entirely discretionary\u2014decision to impose a tax penalty. See\n\u00a76707A(d). If and only if all those things occur does tax liability\nattach. That threefold contingency matters in assessing whether the\nAnti-Injunction Act applies. Even the Government concedes that when\nthere is \u201ctoo attenuated a chain of connection\u201d between an upstream\nduty and a \u201cdownstream tax,\u201d a court should not view a suit\nchallenging the duty as aiming to \u201crestrain the assessment or\ncollection of a tax.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 38\u201339.[2] That principle favors CIC here. CIC stands\nnowhere near the cusp of tax liability: Between the upstream Notice\nand the downstream tax, the river runs long. So it is again hard to\ncharacterize this suit\u2019s purpose as enjoining a tax.Third, violation of the Notice is punishable not\nonly by a tax, but by separate criminal penalties. As noted above,\nany \u201c[w]illful failure\u201d to comply with the Notice\u2019s reporting rules\ncan lead to as much as a year in prison. \u00a77203; seesupra,at 3\u20134. That fact clinches the case for treating a suit brought to\nset aside the Notice as different from one brought to restrain its\nback-up tax. For the existence of criminal penalties explains why\nan entity like CIC must bring an action in just this form, framing\nits requested relief in just this way. Recall what the Government\nwould have such a party do: disobey the Notice, pay a resulting tax\npenalty, and then bring a refund suit. See Brief for Respondents\n16\u201317;supra,at 5. That approach\u2014not the Anti-Injunction\nAct\u2019s familiar pay-now-sue-later procedure, but one with\nlawbreaking at the start\u2014subjects the party to criminal\npunishment.[3] And that is not\nthe kind of thing an ordinary person risks, even to contest the\nmost burdensome regulation. So the criminal penalties here\npractically necessitate a pre-enforcement, rather than a refund,\nsuit\u2014if there is to be a suit at all. And so too, those penalties\nnecessitate a suit aimed at eliminating the Notice, rather than the\nstatutory tax penalty. Only an injunction against the Notice gives\nthe taxpayer or advisor what it wants: relief from the obligation\nto report transactions. An injunction against the tax penalty would\nnot do so. Because such an injunction would leave both the\nreporting duty and the criminal penalty untouched, the taxpayer or\nadvisor would still have to accede to the Notice\u2019s demands on pain\nof prison time. Small wonder that CIC\u2019s complaint asks for an\ninjunction against the Notice, not one against the tax penalty\nhelping to enforce it. Contrary to the Government\u2019s assertion,\nthose injunctions are not two sides of one coin.For all these reasons, the purpose of CIC\u2019s suit\nis not to \u201crestrain[\u2009] the assessment or collection of [a] tax.\u201d\n\u00a77421(a). The complaint, and particularly the relief sought,\ntargets the Notice\u2019s reporting rule, asking that it be set aside as\na violation of the APA. And nothing in that request smacks of\nartful pleading. To the contrary. That the Notice imposes an\naffirmative duty independent of the tax, entailing its own\nsubstantial costs; that the Notice and tax may remain forever\ndivorced, depending on both CIC\u2019s and the IRS\u2019s choices; that not\nonly the tax but also criminal penalties backstop the Notice\u2014these\nfacts, when combined, readily explain why CIC\u2019s suit targets the\nupstream reporting mandate, not the downstream tax. And because\nthat is the suit\u2019s aim, the Anti-Injunction Act imposes no bar.BThe Government worries that a ruling for CIC\nwill enfeeble the Anti-Injunction Act. If CIC can bring this suit\nnow, the Government claims, a wave of pre-enforcement actions will\nfollow. Canny plaintiffs will assert non-tax reasons (including\nobjections to regulatory demands) for contesting the imposition of\ntaxes. See Brief for Respondents 32, 38. And in that way, taxpayers\nwill obtain just what the Anti- Injunction Act is meant to\nforeclose\u2014orders \u201cpreemptively shield[ing]\u201d their activities or\ntransactions from \u201ctax consequences.\u201dId., at 13. More and\nmore, the Government warns, tax litigation will shift from refund\nactions to pre-enforcement suits. And the IRS\u2019s ability to assess\nand collect taxes will decline in proportion.The Government, however, much overstates the\npossible consequences of today\u2019s ruling. As we have explained, this\nsuit falls outside the Anti-Injunction Act because the injunction\nit requests does not run against a tax at all. Seesupra,at\n9\u201313. The suit contests, and seeks relief from, a separate legal\nmandate; the tax appears on the scene\u2014as criminal penalties do\ntoo\u2014only to sanction that mandate\u2019s violation. Or as Judge\nNalbandian put the point below: \u201c[T]his is not a dispute over\ntaxes.\u201d 925 F.\u00a03d, at 259; seesupra,at 5. By\ncontrast, the kind of case the Government invokes in making its\nfloodgates claim is a conflict over taxes, whether on earning\nincome, or selling stock, or entering into a business transaction.\nIn such a case, the legal rule at issue is a tax provision. The tax\ndoes not backstop the violation of another law that independently\nprohibits or commands an action. Instead, the tax imposes a cost on\nperfectly legal behavior. So there is no target for an injunction\nother than the command to pay the tax; there is no non-tax legal\nobligation to restrain. Given that fact, the Anti-Injunction Act\nbars pre-enforcement review, prohibiting a taxpayer from bringing\n(as the Government fears) a \u201cpreemptive[\u2009]\u201d suit to foreclose tax\nliability. Brief for Respondents 13. And it does so always\u2014whatever\nthe taxpayer\u2019s subjective reason for contesting the tax at issue.\nIf the dispute is about a tax rule\u2014as it is in the run-of-the-mine\nsuits the Government raises\u2014the sole recourse is to pay the tax and\nseek a refund.That is just as true when the tax in question is\na so-called regulatory tax\u2014that is, a tax designed mainly to\ninfluence private conduct, rather than to raise revenue. This Court\nhas long since \u201cabandoned the view that brightline distinctions\nexist between regulatory and revenueraising taxes.\u201dBob\nJones, 416 U.\u00a0S., at 743, n.\u00a017; seeid., at\n741, n.\u00a012;Sonzinskyv.United States,300 U.S.\n506, 513 (1937) (\u201cEvery tax is in some measure regulatory\u201d).\nAnd for just as long, we have rejected the view that regulatory tax\ncases have a special pass from the Anti-Injunction Act. A century\nago, the Court inBaileyv.George,259 U.S.\n16(1922), held that the Act barred a pre-enforcement suit\nchallenging a tax intended to discourage the (then lawful) use of\nchild labor. Some 50 years later, the Court inBob JonesandAmericans Unitedsimilarly held that the Act barred pre-\nenforcement suits challenging IRS decisions to revoke the\ntax-exempt status of entities that had engaged in, respectively,\ndiscriminatory conduct and lobbying activity\u2014conduct that was legal\nbut disfavored for tax purposes. See 416 U.\u00a0S., at 735; 416\nU.\u00a0S., at 755. In doing so, the Court made clear that the\nplaintiffs\u2019 reasons for suing did not matter: It was, for example,\nirrelevant that Bob Jones University objected to the IRS\u2019s \u201cattempt\nto regulate the admissions policies of private universities.\u201d 416\nU.\u00a0S., at 739. Nor did it matter that the tax ruling was in\ntruth an effort to change those policies. Regardless of those\nfacts, the suits sought to prevent the levying of taxes, and so\ncould not go forward. The Anti-Injunction Act, we said then and say\nagain now, draws no distinction between regulatory and revenue-\nraising tax rules. It applies whenever a suit calls for enjoining\nthe IRS\u2019s assessment and collection of taxes\u2014of whatever kind.What sets this suit apart is that it no more\ntargets a regulatory tax than a revenue-raising one. One last time:\nCIC\u2019s action challenges, in both its substantive allegations and\nits request for an injunction, a regulatory mandate\u2014a reporting\nrequirement\u2014separate from any tax. Or said otherwise, the suit\ntargets not a regulatory tax, but instead a regulation that is not\na tax. Here, the tax functions, alongside criminal penalties, only\nas a sanction for noncompliance with the reporting obligation. Had\nCongress, or the IRS acting through a delegation, imposed a tax on\nmicro-captive transactions themselves\u2014and had CIC then brought a\npre-enforcement suit to prevent the IRS from applying that tax\u2014the\nAnti-Injunction Act would have kicked in. Then, CIC would have had\nto pay the tax and seek a refund. But Congress and the IRS chose a\ndifferent path. They imposed a non-tax, reporting obligation to\naddress their concerns about micro-captive agreements. And by that\nchoice, they took suits to enjoin their regulatory response outside\nthe Anti-Injunction Act\u2019s domain.IIICIC\u2019s suit aims to enjoin a standalone\nreporting requirement, whose violation may result in both tax\npenalties and criminal punishment. That is not a suit \u201cfor the\npurpose of restraining the [IRS\u2019s] assessment or collection\u201d of a\ntax, and so does not trigger the AntiInjunction Act. We reverse the\njudgment below and remand the case for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.Notes1Direct Marketingconstrued the Tax Injunction Act\u2014a statute, \u201cmodeled on the\nAnti-Injunction Act,\u201d that limits injunctive relief againststatetax collection. 575 U.\u00a0S., at 8. This Court has\n\u201cassume[d] that words used in both Acts,\u201d such as \u201cassessment\u201d and\n\u201ccollection,\u201d are \u201cgenerally used in the same way.\u201dIbid.2The Government\u2019s own\nexample proves our point. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)\nregulations governing the resale of diesel fuel are enforced in\npart through a penalty that Congress has deemed a tax, in just the\nway it has the penalty here. See \u00a7\u00a76720A(a), 6671(a). The\nGovernment concedes that \u201ca court might well conclude\u201d that a suit\nto enjoin the enforcement of the EPA regulations is \u201cnot one \u2018for\nthe purpose of restraining\u2019 tax assessment or collection, even\nif\u00a0\u201d a ruling for the plaintiff would \u201chave an eventual\ndownstream impact on the IRS\u2019s collection of the [tax] penalty.\u201d\nBrief for Respondents 44. But that example is no different from\nthis case, save that here the IRS, not the EPA, administers the\nregulatory mandate. And that one variance should not matter. As\nexplained above, an IRS reporting requirement absent a tax penalty\nno more triggers the Anti-Injunction Act than an EPA rule does. SeeDirect Marketing Assn.v.Brohl, 575 U.S. 1, 11\u201312\n(2015);supra,at 6\u20137. So adding an identical tax penalty to\neach of those regulatory schemes should affect the Anti-Injunction\nAct analysis in the same way\u2014which is to say, not at\nall.3The Government suggests\nthat criminal liability would not attach to a taxpayer or advisor\nwho refuses to comply with the Notice out of a \u201cgood faith\u201d\nobjection to its validity. Brief for Respondents 46. It is easy to\nsee why the Government wishes that were true: In none of our\nAnti-Injunction Act cases has postponing a taxpayer\u2019s suit until\nafter payment exposed him to criminal penalties\u2014because in no other\ncase has that approach required a taxpayer to break a law in the\nfirst instance. But this Court\u2019s precedent precludes the\nGovernment\u2019s effort to erase the criminal penalties from this case.\nWe have held in no uncertain terms that \u201ca defendant\u2019s views about\nthe validity\u201d of a tax provision\u2014even if held \u201cin good faith\u201d\u2014do\nnot \u201cnegate[\u2009] willfulness or provide[\u2009] a defense to criminal\nprosecution.\u201dCheekv.United States,498 U.S.\n192, 204, 206 (1991). So in failing to report transactions as\nthe Notice requires, an advisor like CIC would risk criminal\npunishment.",
