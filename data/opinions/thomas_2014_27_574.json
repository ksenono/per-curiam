The question presented is whether\nthe employees\u2019 time spent waiting to undergo and undergoing\nthose security screenings is compensable under the Fair Labor\nStandards Act of 1938 (FLSA), 29 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7201et\u00a0seq., as amended by the Portal-to-Portal Act of\n1947, \u00a7251et\u00a0seq.We hold that the time is not\ncompensable. We therefore reverse the judgment of the United States\nCourt of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.IPetitioner Integrity Staffing Solutions, Inc.,\nprovides warehouse staffing to Amazon.com throughout the United\nStates. Respondents Jesse Busk and Laurie Castro worked as hourly\nemployees of Integrity Staffing at warehouses in Las Vegas and\nFenley, Nevada, respectively. As warehouse employees, they\nretrieved products from the shelves and packaged those products for\ndelivery to Amazon customers.Integrity Staffing required its employees to\nundergo a security screening before leaving the warehouse at the\nend of each day. During this screening, employees removed items\nsuch as wallets, keys, and belts from their persons and passed\nthrough metal detectors.In 2010, Busk and Castro filed a putative class\naction against Integrity Staffing on behalf of similarly situated\nemployees in the Nevada warehouses for alleged violations of the\nFLSA and Nevada labor laws. As relevant here, the employees alleged\nthat they were entitled to compensation under the FLSA for the time\nspent waiting to undergo and actually undergoing the security\nscreenings. They alleged that such time amounted to roughly 25\nminutes each day and that it could have been reduced to ade\nminimisamount by adding more security screeners or by\nstaggering the termination of shifts so that employees could flow\nthrough the checkpoint more quickly. They also alleged that the\nscreenings were conducted \u201cto prevent employee theft\u201d\nand thus occurred \u201csolely for the benefit of the employers\nand their customers.\u201d App. 19, 21.The District Court dismissed the complaint for\nfailure to state a claim, holding that the time spent waiting for\nand undergoing the security screenings was not compensable under\nthe FLSA. It explained that, because the screenings occurred after\nthe regular work shift, the employees could state a claim for\ncompensation only if the screenings were an integral and\nindispensable part of the principal activities they were employed\nto perform. The District Court held that these screenings were not\nintegral and indispensable but instead fell into a noncompensable\ncategory of postliminary activities.The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth\nCircuit reversed in relevant part. 713 F.\u00a03d 525 (2013). The\nCourt of Appeals asserted that postshift activities that would\nordinarily be classified as noncompensable postliminary activities\nare nevertheless compensable as integral and indispensable to an\nemployee\u2019s principal activities if those postshift activities\nare necessary to the principal work performed and done for the\nbenefit of the employer.Id., at 530. Accepting as true the\nallegation that Integrity Staffing required the security screenings\nto prevent employee theft, the Court of Appeals concluded that the\nscreenings were \u201cnecessary\u201d to the employees\u2019\nprimary work as warehouse employees and done for Integrity\nStaffing\u2019s benefit.Id., at 531.We granted certiorari, 571 U.\u00a0S. ___\n(2014), and now reverse.IIAEnacted in 1938, the FLSA established a\nminimum wage and overtime compensation for each hour worked in\nexcess of 40 hours in each workweek. \u00a7\u00a76(a)(1), 7(a)(3),\n52Stat. 1062\u20131063. An employer who violated these provisions\ncould be held civilly liable for backpay, liquidated damages, and\nattorney\u2019s fees. \u00a716,id., at 1069.But the FLSA did not define \u201cwork\u201d\nor \u201cworkweek,\u201d and this Court interpreted those terms\nbroadly. It defined \u201cwork\u201d as \u201cphysical or mental\nexertion (whether burdensome or not) controlled or required by the\nemployer and pursued necessarily and primarily for the benefit of\nthe employer and his business.\u201dTennessee Coal, Iron &\nR.\u00a0Co.v.Muscoda Local No. 123, 321 U.\u00a0S.\n590, 598 (1944) . Similarly, it defined \u201cthe statutory\nworkweek\u201d to \u201cinclud[e] all time during which an\nemployee is necessarily required to be on the employer\u2019s\npremises, on duty or at a prescribed workplace.\u201dAndersonv.Mt. Clemens Pottery Co., 328 U.\u00a0S.\n680 \u2013691 (1946). Applying these expansive definitions, the\nCourt found compensable the time spent traveling between mine\nportals and underground work areas,Tennessee Coal,supra, at 598, and the time spent walking from timeclocks to\nwork benches,Anderson,supra, at 691\u2013692.These decisions provoked a flood of litigation.\nIn the six months following this Court\u2019s decision inAnderson, unions and employees filed more than 1,500\nlawsuits under the FLSA. S.\u00a0Rep. No. 37, 80th Cong., 1st\nSess., pp. 2\u20133 (1947). These suits sought nearly $6 billion\nin back pay and liquidated damages for various preshift and\npostshift activities.Ibid.Congress responded swiftly. It found that the\nFLSAhad \u201cbeen interpreted judicially in disregard of\nlong-established customs, practices, and contracts between\nemployers and employees, thereby creating wholly unexpected\nliabilities, immense in amount and retroactive in operation, upon\nemployers.\u201d 29 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7251(a). Declaring the\nsituation to be an \u201cemergency,\u201d Congress found that, if\nsuch interpretations \u201cwere permitted to stand,\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. the payment of such liabilities would bring about\nfinancial ruin of many employers\u201d and \u201cemployees would\nreceive windfall payments .\u00a0.\u00a0. for activities performed\nby them without any expectation of reward beyond that included in\ntheir agreed rates of pay.\u201d \u00a7\u00a7251(a)\u2013(b).Congress met this emergency with the\nPortal-to-Portal Act. The Portal-to-Portal Act exempted employers\nfrom liability for future claims based on two categories of\nwork-related activities as follows:\u201c(a) Except as provided in subsection\n(b) [which covers work compensable by contract or custom], no\nemployer shall be subject to any liability or punishment under the\nFair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended, .\u00a0.\u00a0. on\naccount of the failure of such employer .\u00a0.\u00a0.to pay an\nemployee overtime compensation, for or on account of any of the\nfollowing activities of such employee engaged in on or after the\ndate of the enactment of this Act\u2014\u201c(1) walking, riding, or traveling to and\nfrom the ac-tual place of performance of the principal activity or\nac-tivities which such employee is employed to perform, and\u201c(2) activities which are preliminary to\nor postliminary to said principal activity or activities,\u201cwhich occur either prior to the time on\nany particular workday at which such employee commences, or\nsubsequent to the time on any particular workday at which he\nceases, such principal activity or activities.\u201d \u00a74,\n61Stat. 86\u201387 (codified at 29 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7254(a)).At issue here is the exemption for\n\u201cactivities which are preliminary to or postliminary to said\nprincipal activity or activities.\u201dBThis Court has consistently interpreted\n\u201cthe term \u2018principal activity or activities\u2019 [to]\nembrac[e] all activities which are an \u2018integral and\nindispensable part of the principal activities.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIBP, Inc.v.Alvarez, 546 U.\u00a0S. 21 \u201330\n(2005) (quotingSteinerv.Mitchell, 350 U.\u00a0S.\n247 \u2013253 (1956)). Our prior opinions used those words in\ntheir ordinary sense. The word \u201cintegral\u201d means\n\u201c[b]elonging to or making up an integral whole; constituent,\ncomponent;spec[ifically] necessary to the\ncompleteness or integrity of the whole; forming an intrinsic\nportion or element, as distinguished from an adjunct or\nappendage.\u201d 5 Oxford English Dictionary 366 (1933) (OED);\naccord, Brief for United States asAmicus Curiae20 (Brief\nfor United States); see also Webster\u2019s New International\nDictionary 1290 (2d ed. 1954) (Webster\u2019s Second)\n(\u201c[e]ssential to completeness; constituent, as a\npart\u201d). And, when used to describe a duty,\n\u201cindispensable\u201d means a duty \u201c[t]hat cannot be\ndispensed with, remitted, set aside, disregarded, or\nneglected.\u201d 5 OED 219; accord, Brief for United States 19;\nsee also Webster\u2019s Second 1267 (\u201c[n]ot capable of being\ndispensed with, set aside, neglected, or pronounced\nnonobligatory\u201d). An activity is therefore integral and\nindispensable to the principal activities that an employee is\nemployed to perform if it is an intrinsic element of those\nactivities and one with which the employee cannot dispense if he is\nto perform his principal activities. As we describe below, this\ndefinition, as applied in these circumstances, is consistent with\nthe Department of Labor\u2019s regulations.Our precedents have identified several\nactivities that satisfy this test. For example, we have held\ncompensable the time battery-plant employees spent showering and\nchanging clothes because the chemicals in the plant were\n\u201ctoxic to human beings\u201d and the employer conceded that\n\u201cthe clothes-changing and showering activities of the\nemployees [were] indispensable to the performance of their\nproductive work and integrally related thereto.\u201dSteiner,supra, at 249, 251. And we have held\ncompensable the time meatpacker employees spent sharpening their\nknives because dull knives would \u201cslow down production\u201d\non the assembly line, \u201caffect the appearance of the meat as\nwell as the quality of the hides,\u201d \u201ccause waste,\u201d\nand lead to \u201caccidents.\u201dMitchellv.King\nPacking Co., 350 U.\u00a0S. 260, 262 (1956) . By contrast, we\nhave held noncompensable the time poultry-plant employees spent\nwaiting to don protective gear because such waiting was \u201ctwo\nsteps removed from the productive activity on the assembly\nline.\u201dIBP,supra, at 42.The Department of Labor\u2019s regulations are\nconsistent with this approach. See 29 CFR \u00a7790.8(b) (2013)\n(\u201cThe term \u2018principal activities\u2019 includes all\nactivities which are an integral part of a principal\nactivity\u201d); \u00a7790.8(c) (\u201cAmong the activities\nincluded as an integral part of a principal activity are those\nclosely related activities which are indispensable to its\nperformance\u201d). As an illustration, those regulations explain\nthat the time spent by an employee in a chemical plant changing\nclothes would be compensable if he \u201cc[ould not] perform his\nprincipal activities without putting on certain clothes\u201d but\nwould not be compensable if \u201cchanging clothes [were] merely a\nconvenience to the employee and not directly related to his\nprincipal activities.\u201d See \u00a7790.8(c). As the regulations\nexplain, \u201cwhen performed under the conditions normally\npresent,\u201d activities including \u201cchecking in and out and\nwaiting in line to do so, changing clothes, washing up or\nshowering, and waiting in line to receive pay checks\u201d are\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018preliminary\u2019\u00a0\u201d or\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018postliminary\u2019\u00a0\u201d activities.\n\u00a7790.7(g).IIIAThe security screenings at issue here are\nnoncompensable postliminary activities. To begin with, the\nscreenings were not the \u201cprincipal activity or activities\nwhich [the] employee is employed to perform.\u201d 29\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7254(a)(1). Integrity Staffing did not\nemploy its workers to undergo security screenings, but to retrieve\nproducts from warehouse shelves and package those products for\nshipment to Amazon customers.The security screenings also were not\n\u201cintegral and indispensable\u201d to the employees\u2019\nduties as warehouse workers. As explained above, an activity is not\nintegral and indispensable to an employee\u2019s principal\nactivities unless it is an intrinsic element of those activities\nand one with which the employee cannot dispense if he is to perform\nthose activities. The screenings were not an intrinsic element of\nretrieving products from warehouse shelves or packaging them for\nshipment. And Integrity Staffing could have eliminated the\nscreenings altogether without impairing the employees\u2019\nability to complete their work.The Solicitor General, adopting the position of\nthe Department of Labor, agrees that these screenings were\nnoncompensable postliminary activities. See Brief for United States\n10. That view is fully consistent with an Opinion Letter the\nDepartment issued in 1951. The letter found noncompensable a\npreshift security search of employees in a rocket-powder plant\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018for matches, spark producing devices such as\ncigarette lighters, and other items which have a direct bearing on\nthe safety of the employees,\u2019\u00a0\u201d as well as a\npostshift security search of the employees done\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018for the purpose of preventing\ntheft.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Opinion Letter from Dept. of Labor, Wage\nand Hour Div., to Dept. of Army, Office of Chief of Ordnance (Apr.\n18, 1951), pp. 1\u20132 (available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case\nfile). The Department drew no distinction between the searches\nconducted for the safety of the employees and those conducted for\nthe purpose of preventing theft\u2014neither were compensable\nunder the Portal-to-Portal Act.BThe Court of Appeals erred by focusing on\nwhether an employerrequireda particular activity. The\nintegral and indispensable test is tied to the productive work that\nthe employee isemployed to perform. See,e.g., IBP,546 U.\u00a0S., at 42;Mitchell,supra, at 262;Steiner, 350 U.\u00a0S., at 249\u2013251; see also 29 CFR\n\u00a7790.8(a) (explaining that the term \u201cprincipal\nactivities\u201d was \u201cconsidered sufficiently broad to\nembrace within its terms such activities as are indispensable tothe performance of productive work\u201d (internal\nquotation marks omitted; emphasis added)); \u00a7790.8(c)\n(\u201cAmong the activities included as an integral part of a\nprincipal activity are those closely related activities which are\nindispensableto its performance\u201d (emphasis\nadded)).If the test could be satisfied merely by the\nfact that an employer required an activity, it would sweep into\n\u201cprincipal activities\u201d the very activities that the\nPortal-to-Portal Act was designed to address. The employer inAnderson, for instance, required its employees to walk\n\u201cfrom a timeclock near the factory gate to a\nworkstation\u201d so that they could \u201cbegin their\nwork,\u201d \u201cbut it is indisputable that the\nPortal-to-Portal Act evinces Congress\u2019 intent to repudiateAnderson\u2019s holding that such walking time was\ncompensable under the FLSA.\u201dIBP,supra, at 41.\nA test that turns on whether the activity is for the benefit of the\nemployer is similarly overbroad.Finally, we reject the employees\u2019 argument\nthat time spent waiting to undergo the security screenings is\ncompensable under the FLSA because Integrity Staffing could have\nreduced that time to ade minimisamount. The fact that an\nemployer could conceivably reduce the time spent by employees on\nany preliminary or postliminary activity does not change the nature\nof the activity or its relationship to the principal activities\nthat an employee is employed to perform. These arguments are\nproperly presented to the employer at the bargaining table, see 29\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7254(b)(1), not to a court in an FLSA\nclaim.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*We hold that an activity is integral and\nindispensable to the principal activities that an employee is\nemployed to perform\u2014and thus compensable under the\nFLSA\u2014if it is an intrinsic element of those activities and\none with which the employee cannot dispense if he is to perform his\nprincipal activities. Because the employees\u2019 time spent\nwaiting to undergo and undergoing Integrity Staffing\u2019s\nsecurity screenings does not meet these criteria, we reverse the\njudgment of the Court of Appeals.It is so ordered.",
