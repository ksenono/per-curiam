But those grants of\nimmunity are subject to exception.Petitioners hold a judgment against respondent\nIslamic Republic of Iran pursuant to one such exception to\njurisdictional immunity, which applies where the foreign state is\ndesignated as a state sponsor of terrorism and the claims arise out\nof acts of terrorism. See \u00a71605A. The issue presented in this case\nis whether certain property of Iran, specifically, a collection of\nantiquities owned by Iran but in the possession of respondent\nUniversity of Chicago, is subject to attachment and execution by\npetitioners in satisfaction of that judgment. Petitioners contend\nthat the property is stripped of its immunity by another provision\nof the FSIA, \u00a71610(g), which they maintain provides a blanket\nexception to the immunity typically afforded to the property of a\nforeign state where the party seeking to attach and execute holds a\n\u00a71605A judgment.We disagree. Section 1610(g) serves to identify\nproperty that will be available for attachment and execution in\nsatisfaction of a \u00a71605A judgment, but it does not in itself divest\nproperty of immunity. Rather, the provision\u2019s language \u201cas provided\nin this section\u201d shows that \u00a71610(g) operates only when the\nproperty at issue is exempt from immunity as provided elsewhere in\n\u00a71610. Petitioners cannot invoke \u00a71610(g) to attach and execute\nagainst the antiquities at issue here, which petitioners have not\nestablished are exempt from immunity under any other provision in\n\u00a71610.IAOn September 4, 1997, Hamas carried out three\nsuicide bombings on a crowded pedestrian mall in Jerusalem,\nresulting in the deaths of 5 people and injuring nearly 200 others.\nPetitioners are United States citizens who were either wounded in\nthe attack or are the close relatives of those who were injured. In\nan attempt to recover for their harm, petitioners sued Iran in the\nDistrict Court for the District of Columbia, alleging that Iran was\nresponsible for the bombing because it provided material support\nand training to Hamas. At the time of that action, Iran was subject\nto the jurisdiction of the federal courts pursuant to 28\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71605(a)(7) (1994 ed., Supp. II), which\nrescinded the immunity of foreign states designated as state\nsponsors of terrorism with respect to claims arising out of acts of\nterrorism. Iran did not appear in the action, and the District\nCourt entered a default judgment in favor of petitioners in the\namount of $71.5 million.[1]When Iran did not pay the judgment, petitioners\nbrought this action in the District Court for the Northern District\nof Illinois to attach and execute against certain Iranian assets\nlocated in the United States in satisfaction of their judgment.\nThose assets\u2014a collection of approximately 30,000 clay tablets and\nfragments containing ancient writings, known as the Persepolis\nCollection\u2014are in the possession of the University of Chicago,\nhoused at its Oriental Institute. University archeologists\nrecovered the artifacts during an excavation of the old city of\nPersepolis in the 1930\u2019s. In 1937, Iran loaned the collection to\nthe Oriental Institute for research, translation, and\ncataloging.[2]Petitioners maintained in the District Court,inter alia, that \u00a71610(g) of the FSIA renders the Persepolis\nCollection subject to attachment and execution. The District Court\nconcluded otherwise and held that \u00a71610(g) does not deprive the\nPersepolis Collection of the immunity typically afforded the\nproperty of a foreign sovereign. The Court of Appeals for the\nSeventh Circuit affirmed. 830 F.\u00a03d 470 (2016). As relevant,\nthe Seventh Circuit held that the text of \u00a71610(g) demonstrates\nthat the provision serves to identify the property of a foreign\nstate or its agencies or instrumentalities that are subject to\nattachment and execution, but it does not in itself divest that\nproperty of immunity. The Court granted certiorari to resolve a\nsplit among the Courts of Appeals regarding the effect of\n\u00a71610(g).[3] 582 U.\u00a0S. ___\n(2017). We agree with the conclusion of the Seventh Circuit, and\ntherefore affirm.BWe start with a brief review of the historical\ndevelopment of foreign sovereign immunity law and the statutory\nframework at issue here, as it provides a helpful guide to our\ndecision. This Court consistently has recognized that foreign\nsovereign immunity \u201cis a matter of grace and comity on the part of\nthe United States.\u201dVerlinden B. V.v.Central Bank of\nNigeria, 461 U.\u00a0S. 480, 486 (1983) ;Schooner\nExchangev.McFaddon,7 Cranch 116, 136 (1812). In\ndetermining whether to exercise jurisdiction over suits against\nforeign sovereigns, courts traditionally \u201cdeferred to the decisions\nof the political branches .\u00a0.\u00a0. on whether to take\njurisdiction over actions against foreign sovereigns.\u201dVerlinden, 461 U.\u00a0S., at 486.Prior to 1952, the State Department generally\nheld the position that foreign states enjoyed absolute immunity\nfrom all actions in the United States. Seeibid.But, as\nforeign states became more involved in commercial activity in the\nUnited States, the State Department recognized that such\nparticipation \u201cmakes necessary a practice which will enable persons\ndoing business with them to have their rights determined in the\ncourts.\u201d J. Tate, Changed Policy Concerning the Granting of\nSovereign Immunity to Foreign Governments, 26 Dept. State Bull.\n984, 985 (1952). The Department began to follow the \u201crestrictive\u201d\ntheory of foreign sovereign immunity in advising courts whether\nthey should take jurisdiction in any given case. Immunity typically\nwas afforded in cases involving a foreign sovereign\u2019s public acts,\nbut not in \u201ccases arising out of a foreign state\u2019s strictly\ncommercial acts.\u201dVerlinden, 461 U.\u00a0S., at 487.In 1976, Congress enacted the FSIA in an effort\nto codify this careful balance between respecting the immunity\nhistorically afforded to foreign sovereigns and holding them\naccountable, in certain circumstances, for their actions. 90Stat.\n2891, as amended, 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71602et\u00a0seq.\u201cFor the most part, the Act\u201d tracks \u201cthe restrictive theory of\nsovereign immunity.\u201dVerlinden, 461 U.\u00a0S., at 488. As a\ndefault, foreign states enjoy immunity \u201cfrom the jurisdiction of\nthe courts of the United States and of the States.\u201d \u00a71604. But this\nimmunity is subject to certain express exceptions. For example, in\nline with the restrictive theory, a foreign sovereign will be\nstripped of jurisdictional immunity when a claim is based upon\ncommercial activity it carried out in the United States. See,e.g.,\u00a71605(a)(2). The FSIA also provides that a foreign\nstate will be subject to suit when it is designated as a state\nsponsor of terrorism and damages are sought as a result of acts of\nterrorism. See \u00a71605A(a).With respect to the immunity of property, the\nFSIA similarly provides as a default that \u201cthe property in the\nUnited States of a foreign state shall be immune from attachment\narrest and execution.\u201d \u00a71609. But, again, there are exceptions, and\n\u00a71610 outlines the circumstances under which property will not be\nimmune. See \u00a71610. For example, subsection (a) expressly provides\nthat property \u201cshall not be immune\u201d from attachment and execution\nwhere,inter alia,it is \u201cused for a commercial activity in\nthe United States\u201d and the \u201cjudgment relates to a claim for which\nthe foreign state is not immune under section 1605A or section\n1605(a)(7) (as such section was in effect on January 27, 2008),\nregardless of whether the property is or was involved with the act\nupon which the claim is based.\u201d \u00a71610(a)(7).Prior to 2008, the FSIA did not address\nexpressly under what circumstances, if any, the agencies or\ninstrumentalities of a foreign state could be held liable for\njudgments against the state. Faced with that question inFirst\nNat. City Bankv.Banco Para el Comercio Exterior de\nCuba, 462 U.\u00a0S. 611 (1983) (Bancec), this Court\nheld that \u201cgovernment instrumentalities established as juridical\nentities distinct and independent from their sovereign should\nnormally be treated as such.\u201dId.,at 626\u2013627. Thus, as a\ndefault, those agencies and instrumentalities of a foreign state\nwere to be considered separate legal entities that cannot be held\nliable for acts of the foreign state. Seeid.,at 628.Nevertheless, the Court recognized that such a\nstringent rule should not be without exceptions. The Court\nsuggested that liability would be warranted, for example, \u201cwhere a\ncorporate entity is so extensively controlled by [the state] that a\nrelationship of principal and agent is created,\u201did.,at\n629, or where recognizing the state and its agency or\ninstrumentality as distinct entities \u201cwould work fraud or\ninjustice,\u201dibid.(internal quotation marks omitted). Seeid.,at 630. But the Court declined to develop a \u201cmechanical\nformula for determining\u201d when these exceptions should apply,id.,at 633, leaving lower courts with the task of assessing\nthe availability of exceptions on a case-by-case basis. Over time,\nthe Courts of Appeals coalesced around the following five factors\n(referred to as theBancecfactors) to aid in this\nanalysis:\u201c(1) the level of economic control by the\ngovernment;\u201c(2) whether the entity\u2019s profits go to the\ngovernment;\u201c(3) the degree to which government officials\nmanage the entity or otherwise have a hand in its daily\naffairs;\u201c(4) whether the government is the real\nbeneficiary of the entity\u2019s conduct; and\u201c(5) whether adherence to separate identities\nwould entitle the foreign state to benefits in United States courts\nwhile avoiding its obligations.\u201dWalter Fuller Aircraft Sales,\nInc.v.Republic of Philippines, 965 F.\u00a02d 1375,\n1380, n. 7 (CA5 1992); see alsoFlatowv.Islamic\nRepublic of Iran, 308 F.\u00a03d 1065, 1071, n.\u00a09 (CA9\n2002).In 2008, Congress amended the FSIA and added\n\u00a71610(g). See NDAA \u00a71083(b)(3)(D), 122Stat. 341\u2013342. Section\n1610(g)(1) provides:\u201c(g) Property in Certain Actions.\u2014\u201c(1) In general. [T]he property of a foreign\nstate against which a judgment is entered under section 1605A, and\nthe property of an agency or instrumentality of such a state,\nincluding property that is a separate juridical entity or is an\ninterest held directly or indirectly in a separate juridical\nentity, is subject to attachment in aid of execution, and\nexecution, upon that judgment as provided in this section,\nregardless of\u2014\u201c(A) the level of economic control over the\nproperty by the government of the foreign state;\u201c(B) whether the profits of the property go to\nthat government;\u201c(C) the degree to which officials of that\ngovernment manage the property or otherwise control its daily\naffairs;\u201c(D) whether that government is the sole\nbeneficiary in interest of the property; or\u201c(E) whether establishing the property as a\nseparate entity would entitle the foreign state to benefits in\nUnited States courts while avoiding its obligations.\u201dSubparagraphs (A) through (E) incorporate almost\nverbatim the fiveBancecfactors, leaving no dispute that,\nat a minimum, \u00a71610(g) serves to abrogateBancecwith\nrespect to the liability of agencies and instrumentalities of a\nforeign state where a \u00a71605A judgment holder seeks to satisfy a\njudgment held against the foreign state. The issue at hand is\nwhether \u00a71610(g) does something more; whether, like the commercial\nactivity exception in \u00a71610(a)(7), it provides an independent\nexception to immunity so that it allows a \u00a71605A judgment holder to\nattach and execute againstanyproperty of the foreign\nstate, regardless of whether the property is deprived of immunity\nelsewhere in \u00a71610.IIWe turn first to the text of the statute.\nSection 1610(g)(1) provides that certain property will be \u201csubject\nto attachment in aid of execution, and execution, upon [a \u00a71605A]\njudgmentas provided in this section.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The\nmost natural reading is that \u201cthis section\u201d refers to \u00a71610 as a\nwhole, so that \u00a71610(g)(1) will govern the attachment and execution\nof property that is exempted from the grant of immunity as provided\nelsewhere in \u00a71610. Cf.Renov.American-Arab\nAnti-Discrimination Comm., 525 U.\u00a0S. 471, 487 (1999)\n(noting that the phrase \u201c[e]xcept as provided in this section\u201d in\none subsection serves to incorporate \u201cthe rest of\u201d the section in\nwhich the subsection appears).Other provisions of \u00a71610 unambiguously revoke\nthe immunity of property of a foreign state, including specifically\nwhere a plaintiff holds a judgment under \u00a71605A, provided certain\nexpress conditions are satisfied. For example, subsection (a)\nprovides that \u201cproperty in the United States .\u00a0.\u00a0. used\nfor a commercial activity in the United States .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nshall not be immune\u201d from attachment and execution in seven\nenumerated circumstances, including when \u201cthe judgment relates to a\nclaim for which the foreign state is not immune under section 1605A\n.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d \u00a71610(a)(7). Subsections (b), (d), and (e)\nsimilarly set out circumstances in which certain property of a\nforeign state \u201cshall not be immune.\u201d[4] And two other provisions within \u00a71610 specifically\nallow \u00a71605A judgment holders to attach and execute against\nproperty of a foreign state, \u201c[n]otwithstanding any other provision\nof law,\u201d including those provisions otherwise granting immunity,\nbut only with respect to assets associated with certain regulated\nand prohibited financial transactions. See \u00a71610(f\u00a0)(1)(A);\nTerrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (TRIA), \u00a7201(a), 116Stat.\n2337, note following 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71610.Section 1610(g) conspicuously lacks the textual\nmarkers, \u201cshall not be immune\u201d or \u201cnotwithstanding any other\nprovision of law,\u201d that would have shown that it serves as an\nindependent avenue for abrogation of immunity. In fact, its use of\nthe phrase \u201cas provided in this section\u201d signals the opposite: A\njudgment holder seeking to take advantage of \u00a71610(g)(1) must\nidentify a basis under one of \u00a71610\u2019s express immunity-abrogating\nprovisions to attach and execute against a relevant property.Reading \u00a71610(g) in this way still provides\nrelief to judgment holders who previously would not have been able\nto attach and execute against property of an agency or\ninstrumentality of a foreign state in light of this Court\u2019s\ndecision inBancec. Suppose, for instance, that plaintiffs\nobtain a \u00a71605A judgment against a foreign state and seek to\ncollect against the assets located in the United States of a\nstate-owned telecommunications company. Cf.Alejandrev.Telefonica Larga Distancia de Puerto Rico, Inc., 183\nF.\u00a03d 1277 (CA11 1999). Prior to the enactment of \u00a71610(g),\nthe plaintiffs would have had to establish that theBancecfactors favor holding the agency or instrumentality liable for the\nforeign state\u2019s misconduct. With \u00a71610(g), however, the plaintiffs\ncould attach and execute against the property of the state-owned\nentity regardless of theBancecfactors, so long as the\nplaintiffs can establish that the property is otherwise not immune\n(e.g.,pursuant to \u00a71610(a)(7) because it is used in\ncommercial activity in the United States).Moreover, our reading of \u00a71610(g)(1) is\nconsistent \u201cwith one of the most basic interpretive canons, that\n[a] statute should be construed so that effect is given to all its\nprovisions, so that no part will be inoperative or superfluous,\nvoid or insignificant.\u201dCorleyv.United States, 556\nU.\u00a0S. 303, 314 (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted).\nSection 1610 expressly references \u00a71605A judgments in its\nimmunity-abrogating provisions, such as 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7\u00a71610(a)(7), (b)(3), (f\u00a0)(1), and \u00a7201 of the TRIA, showing\nthat those provisions extend to \u00a71605A judgment holders\u2019 ability to\nattach and execute against property. If the Court were to conclude\nthat \u00a71610(g) establishes a basis for the withdrawal of property\nimmunity any time a plaintiff holds a judgment under \u00a71605A, each\nof those provisions would be rendered superfluous because a\njudgment holder could always turn to \u00a71610(g), regardless of\nwhether the conditions of any other provision were met.[5]The Court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a71610(g) is also\nconsistent with the historical practice of rescinding attachment\nand execution immunity primarily in the context of a foreign\nstate\u2019s commercial acts. SeeVerlinden, 461 U.\u00a0S., at\n487\u2013488. Indeed, the FSIA expressly provides in its findings and\ndeclaration of purpose that\u201c[u]nder international law, states are not\nimmune from the jurisdiction of foreign courts insofar as their\ncommercial activities are concerned, and their commercial property\nmay be levied upon for the satisfaction of judgments rendered\nagainst them in connection with their commercial activities.\u201d\n\u00a71602.This focus of the FSIA is reflected within\n\u00a71610, as subsections (a), (b), and (d) all outline exceptions to\nimmunity of property when that property is used for commercial\nactivity. The Court\u2019s reading of \u00a71610(g) means that individuals\nwith \u00a71605A judgments against a foreign state must primarily invoke\nother provisions revoking the grant of immunity for property\nrelated to commercial activity, including \u00a71610(a)(7), unless the\nproperty is expressly carved out in an exception that applies\n\u201c[n]otwithstanding any other provision of law,\u201d\n\u00a71610(f\u00a0)(1)(A); \u00a7201(a) of the TRIA. That result is\nconsistent with the history and structure of the FSIA.Throughout the FSIA, special avenues of relief\nto victims of terrorism exist, even absent a nexus to commercial\nactivity. Where the FSIA goes so far as to divest a foreign state\nor property of immunity in relation to terrorism-related judgments,\nhowever, it does so expressly. See \u00a7\u00a71605A, 1610(a)(7), (b)(3),\n(f\u00a0)(1)(A); \u00a7201(a) of the TRIA. Out of respect for the\ndelicate balance that Congress struck in enacting the FSIA, we\ndecline to read into the statute a blanket abrogation of attachment\nand execution immunity for \u00a71605A judgment holders absent a clearer\nindication of Congress\u2019 intent.IIIAPetitioners resist that the phrase \u201cas\nprovided in this section\u201d refers to \u00a71610 as a whole and contend\nthat Congress more likely was referencing a specific provision\nwithin \u00a71610 or a section in the NDAA. That explanation is\nunpersuasive.Petitioners first assert that \u201cthis section\u201d\nmight refer to procedures contained in \u00a71610(f\u00a0). Section\n1610(f\u00a0) permits \u00a71605A judgment holders to attach and execute\nagainst property associated with certain regulated and prohibited\nfinancial transactions, \u00a71610(f\u00a0)(1), and it provides that the\nUnited States Secretary of State and Secretary of the Treasury will\nmake every effort to assist in \u201cidentifying, locating, and\nexecuting against the property of [a] foreign state or any agency\nor instrumentality of such state,\u201d \u00a71610(f\u00a0)(2). Petitioners\npoint out that paragraph (1) of subsection (f\u00a0) has never come\ninto effect because it was immediately waived by the President\nafter it was enacted, pursuant to \u00a71610(f\u00a0)(3).[6] So, the argument goes, it would make sense\nthat Congress created \u00a71610(g) as an alternative mechanism to\nachieve a similar result.[7]This is a strained and unnatural reading of the\nphrase \u201cas provided in this section.\u201d In enacting \u00a7201(a) of the\nTRIA, which, similar to 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71610(f\u00a0),\npermits attachment and execution against blocked assets, Congress\nsignaled that it was rescinding immunity by permitting attachment\nand execution \u201c[n]otwithstanding any other provision of law.\u201d See\n\u00a7201(a) of the TRIA. Had Congress likewise intended \u00a71610(g) to\nhave such an effect, it knew how to say so. Cf.Bank Markaziv.Peterson, 578 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___, n.\u00a02 (2016) (slip\nop., at 4, n.\u00a02) (noting that \u201c[s]ection 1610(g) does not take\nprecedence over \u2018any other provision of law,\u2019 as the TRIA\ndoes\u201d).Petitioners fare no better in arguing that\nCongress may have intended \u201cthis section\u201d to refer only to the\ninstruction in \u00a71610(f\u00a0)(2) that the United States Government\nassist in identifying assets. Section 1610(f\u00a0)(2) does not\nprovide for attachment or execution at all, so petitioners\u2019\nargument does not account for the lack of textual indicators that\nexist in provisions like \u00a7\u00a71610(a)(7) and (f\u00a0)(1) that\nunambiguously abrogate immunity and permit attachment and\nexecution.Finally, petitioners assert that \u201cthis section\u201d\ncould possibly reflect a drafting error that was intended to\nactually refer to \u00a71083 of the NDAA, the Public Law in which\n\u00a71610(g) was enacted. This interpretation would require not only a\nstark deviation from the plain text of \u00a71610(g), but also a\ndeparture from the clear text of the NDAA. Section 1083(b)(3) of\nthe NDAA provides that \u201cSection 1610 of title 28, United States\nCode, is amended .\u00a0.\u00a0. by adding at the end\u201d the new\nsubsection \u201c(g).\u201d 122Stat. 341. The language \u201cthis section\u201d within\n(g), then, clearly and expressly incorporates the NDAA\u2019s reference\nto \u201cSection 1610\u201d as a whole. There is no basis to conclude that\nCongress\u2019 failure to change \u201cthis section\u201d in \u00a71610(g) was the\nresult of a mere drafting error.BIn an effort to show that \u00a71610(g) does much\nmore than simply abrogate theBancecfactors, petitioners\nargue that the words \u201cproperty of a foreign state,\u201d which appear in\nthe first substantive clause of \u00a71610(g), would otherwise be\nrendered superfluous because the property of a foreign state will\nnever be subject to aBancecinquiry. By its plain text,\n\u00a71610(g)(1) permits enforcement of a \u00a71605A judgment against both\nthe property of a foreign state and the property of the agencies or\ninstrumentalities of that foreign state. Because theBancecfactors would never have applied to the property of a foreign\nstate, petitioners contend, those words must signal something else:\nthat \u00a71610(g) provides an independent basis for the withdrawal of\nimmunity.The words \u201cproperty of a foreign state\u201d\naccomplish at least two things, however, that are consistent with\nthe Court\u2019s understanding of the effect of \u00a71610(g). First,\n\u00a71610(g) serves to identify in one place all the categories of\nproperty that will be available to \u00a71605A judgment holders for\nattachment and execution, whether it is \u201cproperty of the foreign\nstate\u201d or property of its agencies or instrumentalities, and\ncommands that the availability of such property will not be limited\nby theBancecfactors. So long as the property is deprived\nof its immunity \u201cas provided in [\u00a71610],\u201d all of the types of\nproperty identified in \u00a71610(g) will be available to \u00a71605A\njudgment holders.Second, in the context of the entire phrase,\n\u201cthe property of a foreign state against which a judgment is\nentered under section 1605A,\u201d the words \u201cforeign state\u201d identify\nthe type of judgment that will invoke application of \u00a71610(g);\nspecifically, a judgment held against a foreign state and entered\nunder \u00a71605A. Without this opening phrase, \u00a71610(g) would abrogate\ntheBancecpresumption of separateness in all cases, not\njust those involving terrorism judgments under \u00a71605A. The words,\n\u201cproperty of a foreign state,\u201d thus, are not rendered superfluous\nunder the Court\u2019s reading because they do not merely identify a\ncategory of property that is subject to \u00a71610(g) but also help\ninform when \u00a71610(g) will apply in the first place. Indeed,\n\u00a71610(g) would make no sense if those words were removed.CAll else aside, petitioners contend that any\nuncertainty in \u00a71610(g) should be resolved by giving full effect to\nthe legislative purpose behind its enactment. Petitioners posit\nthat Congress enacted \u00a71610(g) \u201cwith the specific purpose of\nremoving the remaining obstacles to terrorism judgment\nenforcement.\u201d Brief for Petitioners 26. In support of that\nposition, they reference a brief discussion of \u00a71610(g) in a\nfootnote to the Court\u2019s decision inBank Markazi, 578\nU.\u00a0S. ___, that notes that Congress \u201cexpand[ed] the\navailability of assets for postjudgment execution\u201d when it added\n\u00a71610(g) by making \u201cavailable for execution the property (whether\nor not blocked) of a foreign state sponsor of terrorism, or its\nagency or instrumentality, to satisfy a judgment against that\nstate.\u201dId.,at ___, n.\u00a02 (slip op., at 4, n.\u00a02).\nButBank Markazi\u2019s characterization of \u00a71610(g) simply\nmirrors the text of \u00a71610(g) and is entirely consistent with the\nCourt\u2019s holding today that \u00a71610(g) expands the assets available\nfor attachment and execution by abrogating this Court\u2019s decision inBancecwith respect to judgments held under \u00a71605A. Beyond\ntheir citation toBank Markazi, petitioners have not\ndirected us to any evidence that supports their position that\n\u00a71610(g) was intended to divest all property of a foreign state or\nits agencies or instrumentalities of immunity.IVFor the foregoing reasons, we conclude that 28\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71610(g) does not provide a freestanding basis\nfor parties holding a judgment under \u00a71605A to attach and execute\nagainst the property of a foreign state, where the immunity of the\nproperty is not otherwise rescinded under a separate provision\nwithin \u00a71610. The judgment of the Seventh Circuit is affirmed.It is so ordered.Justice Kagan took no part in the consideration\nor decision of this case.Notes1Congress amended the FSIA\nin 2008 and replaced 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71605(a)(7) with a\nseparate, more expansive provision addressing the foreign sovereign\nimmunity of foreign states that are designated as state sponsors of\nterrorism, \u00a71605A. See National Defense Authorization Act for\nFiscal Year 2008 (NDAA), \u00a71083(a), 122Stat. 338\u2013341. Shortly\nthereafter, petitioners moved in the District Court for an order\nconverting their judgment under \u00a71605(a)(7) to one under the new\nprovision, \u00a71605A, which the District Court granted. SeeRubinv.Islamic Republic of Iran, 563 F.\u00a0Supp.\n2d 38, 39, n.\u00a03 (DC 2008).2Petitioners also sought\nto execute the judgment against three other collections that are no\nlonger at issue in this case: the Chogha Mish Collection, the\nOriental Institute Collection, and the Herzfeld Collection. The\nChogha Mish Collection has been removed from the territorial\njurisdiction of the federal courts, and the Court of Appeals for\nthe Seventh Circuit determined that the Oriental Institute\nCollection and Herzfeld Collection are not property of Iran. See\n830 F.\u00a03d 470, 475\u2013476 (2016). Petitioners do not challenge\nthat decision here.3CompareBennettv.Islamic Republic of Iran, 825 F.3d 949, 959 (CA9 2016)\n(holding that \u00a71610(g) provides a freestanding exception to\nattachment and execution immunity);Weinsteinv.Islamic\nRepublic of Iran, 831 F.\u00a03d 470, 483 (CADC 2016) (same);Kirschenbaumv.650 Fifth Avenue and Related\nProperties, 830 F.\u00a03d 107, 123 (CA2 2016) (same), with 830\nF.\u00a03d, at 481 (concluding that \u00a71610(g) does not create a\nfreestanding exception to immunity).4Section 1610(b), for\nexample, provides that \u201cany property .\u00a0.\u00a0. of [the]\nagency or instrumentality of a foreign state engaged in commercial\nactivity in the United States shall not be immune\u201d from attachment\nand execution in satisfaction of a judgment on a claim for which\nthe agency or instrumentality is not immune under \u00a71605A.\n\u00a71610(b)(3).5To the extent petitioners\nsuggest that those references to \u00a71605A were inadvertent, see Brief\nfor Petitioners 41\u201344, the statutory history further supports the\nconclusion that \u00a71610(a)(7) applies to \u00a71605A judgment holders, as\nthe reference to \u00a71605A was added to \u00a71610(a)(7) in the same Act\nthat created \u00a7\u00a71605A and 1610(g). See NDAA \u00a7\u00a71083(a), (b)(3),\n122Stat. 338\u2013342.6Section 1610(f\u00a0)(3)\nauthorizes the President to waive paragraph (1) of subsection\n(f\u00a0) \u201cin the interest of national security.\u201d President Clinton\nimmediately waived the provision, and the waiver has never been\nwithdrawn.

Reg. 66483 (2000).7Petitioners reference the\ndecision of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit inBennett, 825 F.3d 949, in support of this\nposition.",
