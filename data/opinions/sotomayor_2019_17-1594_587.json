The question presented in this case is\nwhether a federal agency is a \u201cperson\u201d able to seek such review\nunder the statute. We conclude that it is not.IAThe Constitution empowers Congress \u201c[t]o\npromote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for\nlimited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their\nrespective .\u00a0.\u00a0. Discoveries.\u201d Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 8.\nPursuant to that authority, Congress established the United States\nPatent and Trademark Office (Patent Office) and tasked it with \u201cthe\ngranting and issuing of patents.\u201d 35 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a71,\n2(a)(1).To obtain a patent, an inventor submits an\napplication describing the proposed patent claims to the Patent\nOffice. See \u00a7\u00a7111(a)(1), 112. A patent examiner then reviews the\napplication and prior art (the information available to the public\nat the time of the application) to determine whether the claims\nsatisfy the statutory requirements for patent- ability, including\nthat the claimed invention is useful, novel, nonobvious, and\ncontains eligible subject matter. See \u00a7\u00a7101, 102, 103. If the\nPatent Office accepts the claim and issues a patent, the patent\nowner generally obtains exclusive rights to the patented invention\nthroughout the United States for 20 years. \u00a7\u00a7154(a)(1), (2).After a patent issues, there are several avenues\nby which its validity can be revisited. The first is through a\ndefense in an infringement action. Generally, one who intrudes upon\na patent without authorization \u201cinfringes the patent\u201d and becomes\nsubject to civil suit in the federal district courts, where the\npatent owner may demand a jury trial and seek monetary damages and\ninjunctive relief. \u00a7\u00a7271(a), 281\u2013284. If, however, the Federal\nGovernment is the alleged patent infringer, the patent owner must\nsue the Government in the United States Court of Federal Claims and\nmay recover only \u201creasonable and entire compensation\u201d for the\nunauthorized use. 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71498(a).Once sued, an accused infringer can attempt to\nprove by clear and convincing evidence \u201cthat the patent never\nshould have issued in the first place.\u201dMicrosoft Corp.v.i4i L. P.,564 U.S.\n91, 96\u201397 (2011); see 35 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7282(b). If a\ndefendant succeeds in showing that the claimed invention falls\nshort of one or more patentability requirements, the court may deem\nthe patent invalid and absolve the defendant of liability.The Patent Office may also reconsider the\nvalidity of issued patents. Since 1980, the Patent Act has\nempowered the Patent Office \u201cto reexamine\u2014and perhaps cancel\u2014a\npatent claim that it had previously allowed.\u201dCuozzo Speed\nTechnologies,LLCv.Lee, 579 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___\n(2016) (slip op., at 3). This procedure is known as ex\u00a0parte\nreexamination. \u201cAny person at any time\u201d may cite to the Patent\nOffice certain prior art that may \u201cbea[r] on the patentability of\nany claim of a particular patent\u201d; and the person may additionally\nrequest that the Patent Office reexamine the claim on that basis.\n35 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a7301(a), 302(a). If the Patent Office\nconcludes that the prior art raises \u201ca substantial new question of\npatentability,\u201d the agency may reexamine the patent and, if\nwarranted, cancel the patent or some of its claims. \u00a7\u00a7303(a),\n304\u2013307. The Director of the Patent Office may also, on her \u201cown\ninitiative,\u201d initiate such a proceeding. \u00a7303(a).In 1999 and 2002, Congress added an \u201cinter\npartes reexamination\u201d procedure, which similarly invited \u201c[a]ny\nperson at any time\u201d to seek reexamination of a patent on the basis\nof prior art and allowed the challenger to participate in the\nadministrative proceedings and any subsequent appeal. See \u00a7311(a)\n(2000 ed.); \u00a7\u00a7314(a), (b) (2006 ed.);Cuozzo Speed\nTechnologies, 579 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 3).BIn 2011, Congress overhauled the patent system\nby enacting the America Invents Act (AIA), which created the Patent\nTrial and Appeal Board and phased out inter partes reexamination.\nSee 35 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a76; H.\u00a0R. Rep. No. 112\u201398, pt. 1,\npp.\u00a046\u201347. In its stead, the AIA tasked the Board with\noverseeing three new types of post-issuance review proceedings.First, the \u201cinter partes review\u201d provision\npermits \u201ca person\u201d other than the patent owner to petition for the\nreview and cancellation of a patent on the grounds that the\ninvention lacks novelty or nonobviousness in light of \u201cpatents or\nprinted publications\u201d existing at the time of the patent\napplication. \u00a7311.Second, the \u201cpost-grant review\u201d provision\npermits \u201ca person who is not the owner of a patent\u201d to petition for\nreview and cancellation of a patent on any ground of pat-\nentability. \u00a7321; see \u00a7\u00a7282(b)(2), (b)(3). Such proceedings must be\nbrought within nine months of the patent\u2019s issuance. \u00a7321.Third, the \u201ccovered-business-method review\u201d (CBM\nreview) provision provides for changes to a patent that claims a\nmethod for performing data processing or other operations used in\nthe practice or management of a financial product or service. AIA\n\u00a7\u00a718(a)(1), (d)(1), 125Stat. 329, note following 35\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7321, p.\u00a01442. CBM review tracks the\n\u201cstandards and procedures of\u201d post-grant review with two notable\nexceptions: CBM review is not limited to the nine months following\nissuance of a patent, and \u201c[a] person\u201d may file for CBM review only\nas a defense against a charge or suit for infringement.\n\u00a718(a)(1)(B), 125Stat. 330.[1]The AIA\u2019s three post-issuance review proceedings\nare adjudicatory in nature. Review is conducted by a three-member\npanel of the Patent Trial and Appeal Board, 35 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a76(c), and the patent owner and challenger may seek discovery, file\naffidavits and other written memo- randa, and request an oral\nhearing, see \u00a7\u00a7316, 326; AIA \u00a718(a)(1), 125Stat. 329;Oil States\nEnergy Services,LLCv.Greene\u2019s Energy Group,LLC, 584 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___\u2013___ (2018) (slip op., at 3\u20134).\nThe petitioner has the burden of proving unpatentability by a\npreponderance of the evidence. \u00a7\u00a7282, 316(e), 326(e). The Board\nthen either confirms the patent claims or cancels some or all of\nthe claims. \u00a7\u00a7318(b), 328(b). Any party \u201cdissatisfied\u201d with the\nBoard\u2019s final decision may seek judicial review in the Court ofAppeals for the Federal Circuit, \u00a7\u00a7319, 329; see\n\u00a7141(c), and the Director of the Patent Office may intervene,\n\u00a7143.In sum, in the post-AIA world, a patent can be\nreexamined either in federal court during a defense to an\ninfringement action, in an ex\u00a0parte reexamination by the\nPatent Office, or in the suite of three post-issuance review\nproceedings before the Patent Trial and Appeal Board. The central\nquestion in this case is whether the Federal Government can avail\nitself of the three post-issuance review proceedings, including CBM\nreview.CReturn Mail, Inc., owns U.\u00a0S. Patent No.\n6,826,548 (\u2019548 patent), which claims a method for processing mail\nthat is undeliverable. Beginning in 2003, the United States Postal\nService allegedly began exploring the possibility of licensing\nReturn Mail\u2019s invention for use in handling the country\u2019s\nundelivered mail. But the parties never reached an agreement.In 2006, the Postal Service introduced an\nenhanced address-change service to process undeliverable mail.\nReturn Mail\u2019s representatives asserted that the new service\ninfringed the \u2019548 patent, and the company renewed its offer to\nlicense the claimed invention to the Postal Service. In response,\nthe Postal Service petitioned for ex\u00a0parte reexamination of\nthe \u2019548 patent. The Patent Office canceled the original claims but\nissued several new ones, confirming the validity of the \u2019548\npatent. Return Mail then sued the Postal Service in the Court of\nFederal Claims, seeking compensation for the Postal Service\u2019s\nunauthorized use of its invention, as reissued by the Pat- ent\nOffice.While the lawsuit was pending, the Postal\nService again petitioned the Patent Office to review the \u2019548\npatent, this time seeking CBM review. The Patent Board instituted\nreview. The Board agreed with the Postal Service that Return Mail\u2019s\npatent claims subject matter that was ineligible to be patented,\nand it canceled the claims underlying the \u2019548 patent. A divided\npanel of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed. See\n868 F.3d 1350 (2017). As relevant here, the Federal Circuit held,\nover a dissent, that the Government is a \u201cperson\u201d eligible to\npetition for CBM review.Id., at 1366; see AIA \u00a718(a)(1)(B),\n125Stat. 330 (only a qualifying \u201cperson\u201d may petition for CBM\nreview). The court then affirmed the Patent Board\u2019s decision on the\nmerits, invalidating Return Mail\u2019s patent claims.We granted certiorari to determine whether a\nfederal agency is a \u201cperson\u201d capable of petitioning for\npost-issuance review under the AIA.[2] 586 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2018).IIThe AIA provides that only \u201ca person\u201d other\nthan the patent owner may file with the Office a petition to\ninstitute a post-grant review or inter partes review of an issued\npatent. 35 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a7311(a), 321(a). The statute\nlikewise provides that a \u201cperson\u201d eligible to seek CBM review may\nnot do so \u201cunless the person or the person\u2019s real party in interest\nor privy has been sued for infringement.\u201d AIA \u00a718(a)(1)(B),\n125Stat. 330. The question in this case is whether the Government\nis a \u201cperson\u201d capable of instituting the three AIA review\nproceedings.AThe patent statutes do not define the term\n\u201cperson.\u201d Inthe absence of an express statutory\ndefinition, the Court applies a \u201clongstanding interpretive\npresumption that \u2018person\u2019 does not include the sovereign,\u201d and thus\nexcludes a federal agency like the Postal Service.Vermont\nAgency of Natural Resourcesv.United States ex rel.\nStevens,529 U.S.\n765, 780\u2013781 (2000); seeUnited Statesv.Mine\nWorkers,330 U.S.\n258, 275 (1947);United Statesv.Cooper Corp.,312 U.S.\n600, 603\u2013605 (1941);United Statesv.Fox,94 U.S.\n315, 321 (1877).This presumption reflects \u201ccommon usage.\u201dMine Workers, 330 U.\u00a0S., at 275. It is also an express\ndirective from Congress: The Dictionary Act has since 1947 provided\nthe definition of \u201c\u00a0\u2018person\u2019 \u201d that courts use \u201c[i]n\ndetermining the meaning of any Act of Congress, unless the context\nindicates otherwise.\u201d 1 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71; seeRowlandv.California Men\u2019s Colony,Unit II Men\u2019s Advisory\nCouncil,506 U.S.\n194, 199\u2013200 (1993). The Act provides that the word \u201c \u2018person\u2019\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. include[s] corporations, companies, associations,\nfirms, partnerships, societies, and joint stock companies, as well\nas individuals.\u201d \u00a71. Notably absent from the list of \u201cperson[s]\u201d is\nthe Federal Government. SeeMine Workers, 330 U.\u00a0S., at\n275 (reasoning that Congress\u2019 express inclusion of partnerships and\ncorporations in \u00a71 implies that Congress did not intend to include\nthe Government). Thus, although the presumption is not a \u201chard and\nfast rule of exclusion,\u201dCooper, 312 U.\u00a0S., at 604\u2013605,\n\u201cit may be disregarded only upon some affirmative showing of\nstatutory intent to the contrary,\u201dStevens, 529 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 781.The Postal Service contends that the presumption\nis strongest where interpreting the word \u201cperson\u201d to include the\nGovernment imposes liability on the Government, and is weakest\nwhere (as here) interpreting \u201cperson\u201d in that way benefits the\nGovernment. In support of this argument, the Postal Service points\nto a different interpretive canon: that Congress must unequivocally\nexpress any waiver of sovereign immunity for that waiver to be\neffective. SeeFAAv.Cooper,566\nU.S. 284, 290 (2012). That clear-statement rule inherently\napplies only when a party seeks to hold the Government liable for\nits actions; otherwise immunity is generally irrelevant. In the\nPostal Service\u2019s view, the presumption against treating the\nGovernment as a statutory person works in tandem with the\nclear-statement rule regarding immunity, such that both apply only\nwhen a statute would subject the Government to liability.Our precedents teach otherwise. In several\ninstances, this Court has applied the presumption against treating\nthe Government as a statutory person when there was no question of\nimmunity, and doing so would instead exclude the Federal Government\nor one of its agencies from accessing a benefit or favorable\nprocedural device. InCooper, 312 U.\u00a0S., at 604\u2013605,\n614, for example, the Court held that the Federal Government was\nnot \u201c\u00a0\u2018[a]ny person\u2019\u00a0\u201d who could sue for treble damages\nunder \u00a77 of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act. Accord,International\nPrimate Protection Leaguev.Administrators of Tulane Ed.\nFund,500 U.S.\n72, 82\u201384 (1991) (concluding that the National Institutes of\nHealth was not authorized to remove an action as a \u201c\u00a0\u2018person\nacting under [a federal]\u2019 officer\u201d pursuant to 28\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71442(a)(1));Davisv.Pringle,268 U.S.\n315, 317\u2013318 (1925) (reasoning that \u201cnormal usages of speech\u201d\nindicated that the Government was not a \u201cperson\u201d entitled to\npriority under the Bankruptcy Act);Fox, 94 U.\u00a0S., at\n321 (holding that the Federal Government was not a \u201c\u00a0\u2018person\ncapable by law of holding real estate,\u2019\u00a0\u201d absent \u201can express\ndefinition to that effect\u201d).Thus, although the presumption against treating\nthe Government as a statutory person is \u201c\u00a0\u2018particularly\napplicable where it is claimed that Congress has subjected the\n[sovereign] to liability to which they had not been subject\nbefore,\u2019\u00a0\u201dStevens, 529 U.\u00a0S., at 781, it is\nhardly confined to such cases. Here, too, we proceed from the\npresumption that the Government is not a \u201cperson\u201d authorized to\ninitiate these proceedings absent an affirmative showing to the\ncontrary.BGiven the presumption that a statutory\nreference to a \u201cperson\u201d does not include the Government, the Postal\nService must show that the AIA\u2019s context indicates otherwise.\nAlthough the Postal Service need not cite to \u201can express contrary\ndefinition,\u201dRowland, 506 U.\u00a0S., at 200, it must point\nto some indication in the text or context of the statute that\naffirmatively shows Congress intended to include the Government.\nSeeCooper, 312 U.\u00a0S., at 605.The Postal Service makes three arguments for\ndisplacing the presumption. First, the Postal Service argues that\nthe statutory text and context offer sufficient evidence that the\nGovernment is a \u201cperson\u201d with the power to petition for AIA review\nproceedings. Second, the Postal Service contends that federal\nagencies\u2019 long history of participation in the patent system\nsuggests that Congress intended for the Government to participate\nin AIA review proceedings as well. Third, the Postal Service\nmaintains that the statute must permit it to petition for AIA\nreview because \u00a71498 subjects the Government to liability for\ninfringement. None delivers.1The Postal Service first argues that the AIA\u2019s\nreference to a \u201cperson\u201d in the context of post-issuance review\nproceedings must include the Government because other references to\npersons in the patent statutes appear to do so. Indeed, it is often\ntrue that when Congress uses a word to mean one thing in one part\nof the statute, it will mean the same thing elsewhere in the\nstatute. SeeMerrill Lynch,Pierce,Fenner &\nSmith Inc.v.Dabit,547 U.S.\n71, 86 (2006). This principle, however, \u201creadily yields to\ncontext,\u201d especially when a statutory term is used throughout a\nstatute and takes on \u201cdistinct characters\u201d in distinct statutory\nprovisions. SeeUtility Air Regulatory Groupv.EPA,\n573 U.S. 302, 320 (2014) (internal quotation marks omitted). That\nis the case here. The Patent Act and the AIA refer to \u201cperson[s]\u201d\nin at least 18 different places, and there is no clear trend:\nSometimes \u201cperson\u201d plainly includes the Government,[3] sometimes it plainly excludes the\nGovernment,[4] and sometimes\u2014as\nhere\u2014it might be read either way.Looking on the bright side, the Postal Service\nand the dissent, seepost, at 2, focus on \u00a7207(a)(1), which\nauthorizes \u201c[e]ach [f]ederal agency\u201d to \u201capply for, obtain, and\nmaintain patents or other forms of protection .\u00a0.\u00a0. on\ninventions in which the Federal Government owns a right, title, or\ninterest.\u201d It follows from \u00a7207(a)(1)\u2019s express inclusion offederal agencies among those eligible to apply\nfor patents that the statute\u2019s references to \u201cperson[s]\u201d in the\nsubsections governing the patent-application process and questions\nof patentability (\u00a7\u00a7102(a), 118, and 119) must also include federal\nagencies.[5] In other words,\nthe right described in \u00a7207(a)(1) provides a sufficient contextual\nclue that the word \u201cperson\u201d\u2014when used in the other provisions\ngoverning the application process \u00a7207(a)(1) makes available to\nfederal agencies\u2014includes the Government.But \u00a7207(a)(1) provides no such clue as to the\ninterpretation of the AIA review provisions because it implies\nnothing about what a federal agency may or may not do following the\nissuance of someone else\u2019s patent. Conversely, reading the review\nprovisions to exclude the Govern- ment has no bearing on a federal\nagency\u2019s right to obtain a patent under \u00a7207(a)(1). An agency may\nstill apply for and obtain patents whether or not it may petition\nfor a review proceeding under the AIA seeking cancellation of a\npatent it does not own. There is thus no reason to think that\n\u201cperson\u201d must mean the same thing in these two different parts of\nthe statute. SeeUtility Air, 573 U.\u00a0S., at\n320.[6]The Postal Service cites other provisions that\nmay refer to the Government\u2014namely, the \u201cintervening rights\u201d\nprovisions that offer certain protections for \u201cany person\u201d who is\nlawfully making or using an invention when the Patent Office\nmodifies an existing patent claim in a way that deems the person\u2019s\n(previously lawful) use to be infringement. See \u00a7\u00a7252, 307(b),\n318(c), 328(c). The Postal Service argues that the Government must\nbe among those protected by these provisions and from there deduces\nthat it must also be permitted to petition for AIA review\nproceedings because the review provisions and the\nintervening-rights provisions were all added to the Patent Act by\nthe AIA at the same time. SeePowerex Corp.v.Reliant\nEnergy Services,Inc.,551 U.S.\n224, 232 (2007) (invoking the consistent-usage canon where the\nsame term was used in related provisions enacted at the same\ntime).But regardless of whether the intervening-rights\nprovisions apply to the Government (a separate interpretive\nquestion that we have no occasion to answer here), the Postal\nService\u2019s chain of inferences overlooks a confounding link: The\nconsistent-usage canon breaks down where Congress uses the same\nword in a statute in multiple conflicting ways. As noted, that is\nthe case here. In the face of such inconsistency, the mere\nexistence of some Government-inclusive references cannot make the\n\u201caffirmative showing,\u201dStevens, 529 U.\u00a0S., at 781,\nrequired to overcome the presumption that Congress did not intend\nto include the Government among those \u201cperson[s]\u201d eligible to\npetition for AIA review proceedings.[7]2The Postal Service next points to the Federal\nGovernment\u2019s longstanding history with the patent system. It\nreminds us that federal officers have been able to apply for\npatents in the name of the United States since 1883, see Act of\nMar. 3, 1883, 22Stat. 625\u2014which, in the Postal Service\u2019s view,\nsuggests that Congress intended to allow the Government access to\nAIA review proceedings as well. But, as already explained, the\nGovernment\u2019s ability to obtain a patent under \u00a7207(a)(1) does not\nspeak to whether Congress meant for the Government to participate\nas a third-party challenger in AIA review proceedings. As to those\nproceedings, there is no longstanding practice: The AIA was enacted\njust eight years ago.[8]More pertinently, the Postal Service and the\ndissent both note that the Patent Office since 1981 has treated\nfederal agencies as \u201cpersons\u201d who may cite prior art to the agency\nor request an ex\u00a0parte reexamination of an issued patent. Seepost, at 5. Recall that \u00a7301(a) provides that \u201c[a]ny person\nat any time may cite to the Office in writing .\u00a0.\u00a0. prior\nart .\u00a0.\u00a0. which that person believes to have a bearing on\nthe patentability of any claim of a particular patent.\u201d As\nmemorialized in the Patent Office\u2019s Manual of Patent Examining\nProcedure (MPEP), the agency has understood \u00a7301\u2019s reference to\n\u201cany person\u201d to include \u201cgovernmental entit[ies].\u201d Dept. of\nCommerce, Patent and Trademark Office, MPEP \u00a7\u00a72203, 2212 (4th rev.\ned., July 1981).We might take account of this \u201cexecutive\ninterpretation\u201dif we were determining whether Congress meant to\ninclude the Government as a \u201cperson\u201d for purposes of the\nex\u00a0parte reexamination procedures themselves. See,e.g.,United Statesv.Hermanos y Compa\u00f1ia,209 U.S.\n337, 339 (1908). Here, however, the Patent Office\u2019s statement\nin the 1981 MPEP has no direct relevance. Even assuming that the\nGovernment may petition for ex\u00a0parte reexamination,\nex\u00a0parte reexamination is a fundamentally different process\nthan an AIA post-issuance review proceeding.[9] Both share the common purpose of allowing\nnon-patent owners to bring questions of patent validity to the\nPatent Office\u2019s attention, but they do so in meaningfully different\nways.In an ex\u00a0parte reexamination, the third\nparty sends information to the Patent Office that the party\nbelieves bears on the patent\u2019s validity, and the Patent Office\ndecides whether to reexamine the patent. If it decides to do so,\nthe reexamination process is internal; the challenger is not\npermitted to participate in the Patent Office\u2019s process. See 35\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a7302, 303. By contrast, the AIA post-issuance\nreview proceedings are adversarial, adjudicatory proceedings\nbetween the \u201cperson\u201d who petitioned for review and the patent\nowner: There is briefing, a hearing, discovery, and the\npresentation of evidence, and the losing party has appeal rights.\nSeesupra, at 4\u20135. Thus, there are good reasons Congress\nmight have authorized the Government to initiate a hands-off\nex\u00a0parte reexamination but not to become a party to a\nfull-blown adversarial proceeding before the Patent Office and any\nsubsequentappeal. After all, the Government is already in\na unique position among alleged infringers given that 28\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71498 limits patent owners to bench trials\nbefore the Court of Federal Claims and monetary damages, whereas 35\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7271 permits patent owners to demand jury trials\nin the federal district courts and seek other types of relief.Thus, there is nothing to suggest that Congress\nhad the 1981 MPEP statement in mind when it enacted the AIA. It is\ntrue that this Court has often said, \u201c[w]hen administrative and\njudicial interpretations have settled the meaning of an existing\nstatutory provision, repetition of the same language in a new\nstatute indicates, as a general matter, the intent to incorporate\nits administrative and judicial interpretations as well.\u201dBragdonv.Abbott,524 U.S.\n624, 645 (1998). But there is no \u201csettled\u201d meaning of the term\n\u201cperson\u201d with respect to the newly established AIA review\nproceedings. Accordingly, the MPEP does not justify putting aside\nthe presumptive meaning of \u201cperson\u201d here.3Finally, the Postal Service argues that it\nmust be a \u201cperson\u201d who may petition for AIA review proceedings\nbecause, like other potential infringers, it is subject to civil\nliability and can assert a defense of patent invalidity. See\n\u00a7\u00a7282(b)(2)\u2013(3). In the Postal Service\u2019s view, it is anomalous to\ndeny it a benefit afforded to other infringers\u2014the ability to\nchallenge a patentde\u00a0novobefore the Patent Office,\nrather than only as an infringement defense that must be proved by\nclear and convincing evidence. Seeibid.;Microsoft\nCorp., 564 U.\u00a0S., at 95 (holding that \u00a7282\u2019s presumption\nof validity in litigation imposes a clear and convincing evidence\nstandard on defendants seeking to prove invalidity).The Postal Service overstates the asymmetry.\nAgencies retain the ability under \u00a7282 to assert defenses to\ninfringement. Once sued, an agency may, like any other accused\ninfringer, argue that the patent is invalid, and the agency faces\nthe same burden of proof as a defendant in any other infringement\nsuit. The Postal Service lacks only the additional tool of\npetitioning for the initiation of an administrative proceeding\nbefore the Patent Office under the AIA, a process separate from\ndefending an infringement suit.We see no oddity, however, in Congress\u2019\naffording nongovernmental actors an expedient route that the\nGovernment does not also enjoy for heading off potential\ninfringement suits. Those other actors face greater and more\nuncertain risks if they misjudge their right to use technology that\nis subject to potentially invalid patents. Most notably, \u00a71498\nrestricts a patent owner who sues the Government to her \u201creasonable\nand entire compensation\u201d for the Government\u2019s infringing use; she\ncannot seek an injunction, demand a jury trial, or ask for punitive\ndamages, all of which are available in infringement suits against\nnongovernmental actors under \u00a7271(e)(4). Thus, although federal\nagencies remain subject to damages for impermissible uses, they do\nnot face the threat of preliminary injunctive relief that could\nsuddenly halt their use of a patented invention, and they enjoy a\ndegree of certainty about the extent of their potential liability\nthat ordinary accused infringers do not. Because federal agencies\nface lower risks, it is reasonable for Congress to have treated\nthem differently.[10]Finally, excluding federal agencies from the AIA\nreview proceedings avoids the awkward situation that might result\nfrom forcing a civilian patent owner (such as Return Mail) to\ndefend the patentability of her invention in an adversarial,\nadjudicatory proceeding initiated by one federal agency (such as\nthe Postal Service) and overseen by a different federal agency (the\nPatent Office). We are therefore unpersuaded that the Government\u2019s\nexclusion from the AIA review proceedings is sufficiently anomalous\nto overcome the presumption that the Government is not a \u201cperson\u201d\nunder the Act.[11]IIIFor the foregoing reasons, we hold that a\nfederal agency is not a \u201cperson\u201d who may petition for post-issuance\nre-view under the AIA. The judgment of the United\nStates Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit is therefore\nreversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.Notes1The CBM review program\nwill stop accepting new claims in 2020. See AIA \u00a718(a)(3)(A),\n125Stat. 330; 77 Fed. Reg. 48687 (2012).2The Federal Circuit\nrejected Return Mail\u2019s argument that the Postal Service cannot\npetition for CBM review for the independent reason that a suit\nagainst the Government under 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71498 is not a\nsuit for infringement. 868 F.3d 1350, 1366 (2017). We denied Return\nMail\u2019s petition for certiorari on this question and therefore have\nno occasion to resolve it in this case. Accordingly, we assume that\na \u00a71498 suit is one for infringement and refer to it as the\nsame.3For example, the statute\nexpressly includes the Government as a \u201cperson\u201d in \u00a7296(a), which,\nas enacted, provided that States \u201cshall not be immune\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. from suit in Federal court by any person, including\nany governmental or nongovernmental entity, for infringement of a\npatent under section 271.\u201d 35 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7296(a) (1988 ed.,\nSupp. IV) (ruled unconstitutional byFlorida Prepaid\nPostsecondary Ed. Expense Bd.v.College Savings Bank,527 U.S.\n627, 630 (1999)).4For example, in \u00a76(a),\nthe Patent Act provides that the administrative patent judges\ncomprising the Board must be \u201cpersons of competent legal knowledge\nand scientific ability.\u201d Likewise, \u00a7257(e) requires the Patent\nOffice Director to treat as confidential any referral to the\nAttorney General of suspected fraud in the patent process unless\nthe United States charges \u201ca person\u201d with a criminal offense in\nconnection with the fraud. See also \u00a72(b)(11) (authorizing the\nPatent Office to cover the expenses of \u201cpersons\u201d other than federal\nemployees attending programs on intellectual-property protection);\n\u00a7100(h) (defining a \u201c\u00a0\u2018joint research agreement\u2019\u00a0\u201d as a\nwritten agreement between \u201c2 or more persons or entities\u201d). Some of\nthese provisions (\u00a7\u00a72(b)(11), 6(a), and 100(h)) were enacted as\npart of the AIA, alongside the AIA review proceedings. See 125Stat.\n285, 313, 335.5Section 102(a) provides\nthat \u201c[a] person shall be entitled to a patent\u201d as long as the\npatent is novel. Section 118 states that \u201c[a] person to whom the\ninventor has assigned\u201d an invention may file a patent application.\nSection 119 discusses the effect of a patent application filed in a\nforeign country \u201cby any person\u201d on the patent-application process\nin the United States.6Likewise, we are not\npersuaded by the dissent\u2019s suggestion that \u00a7207(a)(3)\u2014which\nauthorizes federal agencies \u201cto protect and administer rights\u201d to\nfederally owned inventions\u2014provides a statutory basis for the\nPostal Service\u2019s initiation of AIA review proceedings. Seepost, at 5\u20136. The statute explains how a federal agency is\nto \u201cprotect\u201d those rights: \u201ceither directly or through contract,\u201d\nsuch as by \u201cacquiring rights for and administering royalties\u201d or\n\u201clicensing.\u201d \u00a7207(a)(3). TheAIA review proceedings, which a\n\u201cperson\u201d may initiate regardless of ownership, do not fall clearly\nwithin the ambit of \u00a7207(a)(3).7The dissent responds that\nwe should set aside the statutory references to \u201cperson[s]\u201d that\nnaturally exclude the Government and instead count only those\nreferences that expressly or impliedly include the Government. Seepost, at 3\u20134. But the point of the canon the PostalService\ninvokes is to ascertain the meaning of a statutory term from its\nconsistent usage in other parts of the statute, not to pick sides\namong differing uses.8Moreover, for those of us\nwho consider legislative history, there is none that suggests\nCongress considered whether the Federal Government or its agencies\nwould have access to the AIA review proceedings.9As discussed above, seesupra, at 2\u20134, ex\u00a0parte reexamination is not one of the\nthree new proceedings added by the AIA, and therefore the question\nwhether its reference to a \u201cperson\u201d includes the Government is\nbeyond the scope of the question presented. Moreover, neither party\ncontests that a federal agency may cite prior art to the Patent\nOffice and ask for ex\u00a0parte reexamination.10If\nthe Government were a \u201cperson\u201d under the AIA, yet another anomaly\nmight arise under the statute\u2019s estoppel provisions. Those\nprovisions generally preclude a party from relitigating issues in\nany subsequent proceedings in federal district court, before the\nInternational Trade Commission, and (for inter partes review and\npost-grant review) before the Patent Office. See 35\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a7315(e), 325(e); AIA\u00a718(a)(1)(D), 125Stat. 330.\nBecause infringement suits against the Government must be brought\nin the Court of Federal Claims\u2014which is not named in the estoppel\nprovisions\u2014the Government might not be precluded by statute from\nrelitigating claims raised before the Patent Office if it were able\nto institute post-issuance review under the AIA. See 28\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71498(a). Although Return Mail cites this\nasymmetry in support of its interpretation, we need not rely on it,\nbecause Return Mail already prevails for the reasons given above.\nAt any rate, the practical effect of the estoppel provisions\u2019\npotential inapplicability to the Government is uncertain given that\nthis Court has not decided whether common-law estoppel applies in\n\u00a71498 suits.11Nor\ndo we find persuasive the dissent\u2019s argument that the Postal\nService should be allowed to petition for post-issuance review\nproceedings because its participation would further the purpose of\nthe AIA: to provide a cost-effective and efficient alternative to\nlitigation in the courts. Seepost, at 5; H.\u00a0R. Rep.\nNo. 112\u201398, pt. 1, pp.\u00a047\u201348 (2001). Statutes rarely embrace\nevery possible measure that would further their general aims, and,\nabsent other contextual indicators of Congress\u2019 intent to include\nthe Government in a statutory provision referring to a \u201cperson,\u201d\nthe mere furtherance of the statute\u2019s broad purpose does not\novercome the presumption in this case. SeeCooper, 312\nU.\u00a0S., at 605 (\u201c[I]t is not our function to engraft on a\nstatute additions which we think the legislature logically might or\nshould have made\u201d).",
