WILKINSv.OFFICER GADDYon petition for writ of certiorari to the united\nstates court of appeals for the fourth circuitNo. 08\u201310914.\u2003Decided February 22, 2010Justice Thomas, with whom Justice\nScalia joins, concurring in the judgment.I agree with the Court that the\nFourth Circuit\u2019s Eighth Amendment analysis is inconsistent withHudsonv.McMillian,503 U. S. 1(1992). But I\ncontinue to believe thatHudsonwas wrongly decided.Ericksonv.Pardus,551 U. S. 89, 95 (2007)\n(dissenting opinion);Farmerv.Brennan,511 U. S. 825, 858\n(1994) (opinion concurring in judgment);Hellingv.McKinney,509 U. S. 25, 37 (1993)\n(dissenting opinion);Hudson,supra, at 17\n(dissenting opinion).\u201cAt the time the Eighth Amendment was\nratified, the word \u2018punishment\u2019 referred to the penalty imposed for\nthe commission of a crime.\u201dHelling,supra, at 38\n(Thomas, J., dissenting).The Court adhered to this\nunderstanding until 1976, when it declared inEstellev.Gamble,429\nU. S. 97, that the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause also\nextends to prison conditions not imposed as part of a criminal\nsentence. See generallyHudson,supra, at 18\u201320\n(Thomas, J., dissenting);Farmer,supra, at 861\n(Thomas, J., concurring in judgment). To limit this abrupt\nexpansion of the Clause, the Court specified that its new\ninterpretation of the Eighth Amendment should not extend to every\ndeprivation a prisoner suffers, but instead should apply\n\u201conly[to] that narrow class of deprivations involving\n\u2018serious\u2019 injury inflicted by prison officials acting with a\nculpable state of mind.\u201dHudson,supra, at 20\n(Thomas, J., dissenting) (citingEstelle,supra,\nat 106); see generallyWilsonv.Seiter,501 U. S. 294, 298\n(1991).Hudson, however, discarded the\nrequirement of serious injury. Building uponEstelle\u2019s\nmislaid foundation, the Court concluded that force, rather than\ninjury, is the relevant inquiry, and that a prisoner who alleges\nexcessive force at the hands of prison officials and suffers\nnothing more thande minimisinjury can state a claim\nunder the Eighth Amendment.Hudsonthus turned the Eighth\nAmendment into \u201ca National Code of Prison Regulation,\u201d 503 U. S.,\nat 28 (Thomas, J., dissenting);Farmer, 511 U. S., at 859\n(Thomas, J., concurring in judgment), with \u201cfederal judges [acting\nas] superintendents of prison conditions nationwide,\u201did.,\nat 860. Although neither the Constitution nor our precedents\nrequire this result, no party to this case asks us to overruleHudson. Accordingly, I concur in the Court\u2019s judgment.",
