    "text": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES_________________No. 17\u2013988_________________LAMPS PLUS, INC., et\u00a0al., PETITIONERSv.FRANK VARELAon writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the ninth circuit[April 24, 2019]Justice Thomas, concurring.As our precedents make clear and the Court\nacknowledges, the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) requires federal\ncourts to enforce arbitration agreements \u201cjust as they would\nordinary contracts: in accordance with their terms.\u201dHowsamv.Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc.,537 U.S.\n79, 87 (2002) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment). Federal\ncourts must therefore apply \u201cbackground principles of state\ncontract law\u201d when evaluating arbitration agreements.Arthur\nAndersen LLPv.Carlisle,556 U.S.\n624, 630 (2009);Perryv.Thomas,482 U.S.\n483, 492, n.\u00a09 (1987). \u201cIn this endeavor, \u2018as with any\nother contract, the parties\u2019 intentions control.\u2019\u00a0\u201dStolt-Nielsen S.\u00a0A.v.AnimalFeeds Int\u2019l Corp.,559 U.S.\n662, 682 (2010) (quotingMitsubishi Motors Corp.v.Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc.,473 U.S.\n614, 626 (1985)). Thus, where an agreement is silent as to\nclass arbitration, a court may not infer from that silence that the\nparties agreed to arbitrate on a class basis. 559 U.\u00a0S., at\n687.Here, the arbitration agreement between Varela\nand Lamps Plus is silent as to class arbitration. If anything, the\nagreement suggests that the parties contemplated only bilateral\narbitration.[1]* App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 24a (waiving \u201cany rightImay have to file a\nlawsuit or other civil action or proceeding relating tomyemployment with the Company\u201d (emphasis added));ibid.(\u201cThe Company and Imutually consent to the resolution by\narbitration of all claims .\u00a0.\u00a0. thatImay have\nagainst the Company\u201d (emphasis added));id., at 24a\u201325a\n(\u201cSpecifically,the Company and Imutually consent to the\nresolution by arbitration of all claims that may hereafter arise in\nconnection withmyemployment\u201d (emphasis added)). This\nagreement provides no \u201ccontractual basis\u201d for concluding that the\nparties agreed to class arbitration,Stolt-Nielsen,supra, at 684, and I would therefore reverse on that\nbasis.The Court instead evaluates whether California\u2019scontra proferentemrule, as applied here, \u201c\u00a0\u2018stands as\nan obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full\npurposes and objectives\u2019 of the FAA.\u201dAnte,at 6 (quotingAT&T Mobility LLCv.Concepcion,563 U.S.\n333, 352 (2011)). I remain skeptical of this Court\u2019s implied\npre-emption precedents, seeWyethv.Levine,555 U.S.\n555, 582\u2013604 (2009) (opinion concurring in judgment), but I\njoin the opinion of the Court because it correctly applies our FAA\nprecedents, seeEpic Systems Corp.v.Lewis, 584 U.\nS. ___ (2018);Concepcion,supra.Notes1*\u00a0Two intermediate\nCalifornia courts have held, based on similar lan-guage, that an\narbitration agreement did not authorize class arbitration. SeeNelsenv.Legacy Partners Residential,Inc.,\n207 Cal. App. 4th 1115, 1129\u20131131, 144 Cal. Rptr. 3d 198, 210\u2013211\n(2012);Kinecta Alternative Financial Solutions,Inc.v.Superior Court of Los Angeles Cty., 205 Cal. App. 4th\n506, 517\u2013519, 140 Cal.
