HORNE, et\u00a0al., PETITIONERSv.DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTUREon writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the ninth circuit[June 22, 2015]Justice Thomas, concurring.I join the Court\u2019s opinion in full. I write\nseparatelyto offer an additional observation concerning Justice\nBreyer\u2019s argument that we should remand the case. The Takings\nClause prohibits the government from taking private property except\n\u201cfor public use,\u201d even when it offers \u201cjust compensation.\u201d\nU.\u00a0S. Const., Amdt. 5. That requirement, as originally\nunderstood, imposes a meaningful constraint on the power of the\nstate\u2014\u201cthe government may take property only if it actually uses or\ngives the public a legal right to use the property.\u201dKelov.New London, 545 U.\u00a0S. 469, 521 (2005) (Thomas, J.,\ndissenting). It is far from clear that the Raisin Administrative\nCommittee\u2019s conduct meets that standard. It takes the raisins of\ncitizens and, among other things, gives them away or sells them to\nexporters, foreign importers, and foreign governments. 7 CFR\n\u00a7989.67(b) (2015). To the extent that the Committee is not taking\nthe raisins \u201cfor public use,\u201d having the Court of Appeals calculate\n\u201cjust compensation\u201d in this case would be a fruitless exercise.",
