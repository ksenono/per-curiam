The decision below held that\nwillfulness is such a prerequisite. App. to Pet. for Cert. 32a.\nThat is incorrect. The relevant authorities, particularly\npre-Lanham Act case law, show that willfulness is a highly\nimportant consideration in awarding profits under \u00a71117(a), but not\nan absolute precondition. I would so hold and concur on that\nground.",
