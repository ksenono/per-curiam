KOONS, KENNETH JAY PUTENSEN, RANDY\nFEAUTO, ESEQUIEL GUTIERREZ, AND JOSE MANUEL GARDEA, PETITIONERSv.UNITED STATESon writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the eighth circuit[June 4, 2018]Justice Alito delivered the opinion of the\nCourt.Under 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73582(c)(2), a\ndefendant is eligible for a sentence reduction if he was initially\nsentenced \u201cbased on a sentencing range\u201d that was later lowered by\nthe United States Sentencing Commission. The five petitioners in\ntoday\u2019s case claim to be eligible under this provision. They were\nconvicted of drug offenses that carried statutory mandatory minimum\nsentences, but they received sentences below these mandatory\nminimums, as another statute allows, because they substantially\nassisted the Government in prosecuting other drug offenders. We\nhold that petitioners\u2019 sentences were \u201cbased on\u201d their mandatory\nminimums and on their substantial assistance to the Government, not\non sentencing ranges that the Commission later lowered. Petitioners\nare therefore ineligible for \u00a73582(c)(2) sentence reductions.IAll five petitioners pleaded guilty before the\nsame sentencing judge to methamphetamine conspiracy offenses that\nsubjected them to mandatory minimum sentences under 21\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7841(b)(1). Before the District Court imposed\nthose sentences, however, it first calculated petitioners\u2019 advisory\nGuidelines ranges, as district courts do in sentencing proceedings\nall around the country. These ranges take into account the\nseriousness of a defendant\u2019s offense and his criminal history in\norder to produce a set of months as a recommended sentence\n(e.g., 151 to 188 months for petitioner Koons). But not only\nare these ranges advisory, they are also tentative: They can be\noverridden by other considerations, such as a congressionally\nmandated minimum sentence. Indeed, the Guidelines themselves\ninstruct that \u201c[w]here a statutorily required minimum sentence is\ngreater than the maximum of the applicable guideline range, the\nstatutorily required minimum sentence shall be the [final]\nguideline sentence.\u201d United States Sentencing Commission,\nGuidelines Manual \u00a75G1.1(b) (Nov. 2016) (USSG); see also\n\u00a71B1.1(a)(8).That is what happened here. In each of\npetitioners\u2019 cases, the top end of the Guidelines range fell below\nthe applicable mandatory minimum sentence, and so the court\nconcluded that the mandatory minimum superseded the Guidelines\nrange.E.g., App. 197; see alsoid., at 70. Thus, in\nall five cases, the court discarded the advisory ranges in favor of\nthe mandatory minimum sentences. Seeid., at 114\u2013115, 148,\n174, 197, 216.When a statute sets out a mandatory minimum\nsentence, a defendant convicted under that statute will generally\nreceive a sentence at or above the mandatory minimum\u2014but not\nalways. If the defendant has substantially assisted the Government\n\u201cin the investigation or prosecution of another person,\u201d the\nGovernment may move under 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73553(e) to allow\nthe district court to \u201cimpose a sentence below\u201d the mandatory\nminimum \u201cso as to reflect [the] defendant\u2019s substantial\nassistance.\u201dThe Government filed such motions in each of\npetitioners\u2019 cases, and in each case, the District Court departed\ndownward from the mandatory minimum because of petitioners\u2019\nsubstantial assistance. In settling on the final sentences, the\ncourt considered the so-called \u201csubstantial-assistance factors\u201d\nfound in \u00a75K1.1(a) of the Guidelines, all of which relate to the\nassistance defendants supply the Government. App. 80, 197; see,e.g., USSG \u00a7\u00a75K1.1(a)(1)\u2013(3), (5) (the \u201cextent,\u201d\n\u201ctimeliness,\u201d \u201csignificance[,] and usefulness\u201d of the defendant\u2019s\nassistance and the \u201ctruthfulness, completeness, and reliability of\n[the] information\u201d provided). In no case did the court consider the\noriginal drug Guidelines ranges that it had earlier discarded. See\nApp. 115\u2013116, 148\u2013154, 174\u2013177, 197\u2013198, 216\u2013218. The sentences\nultimately imposed in these cases represented downward departures\nfrom the mandatory minimums of between 25 and 45 percent. See Brief\nfor United States 3.Years after petitioners\u2019 sentences became final,\nthe Sentencing Commission issued amendment 782, which reduced the\nGuidelines\u2019 base offense levels for certain drug offenses,\nincluding those for which petitioners were convicted. See USSG App.\nC, Amdt. 782 (Supp. Nov. 2012\u2013Nov. 2016); see alsoHughesv.United States,ante, at 7. And because the amendment\napplied retroactively,ibid., it made defendants previously\nconvicted of those offenses potentially eligible for a sentence\nreduction under \u00a73582(c)(2).Petitioners sought such reductions, but in order\nto qualify, they had to show that their sentences were \u201cbased on\u201d\nthe now-lowered drug Guidelines ranges. \u00a73582(c)(2). The courts\nbelow held that petitioners could not make that showing, App.\n93\u201397; 850 F.\u00a03d 973, 977 (CA8 2017), and we granted\ncertiorari to review the question, 583 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2017).IIWe hold that petitioners do not qualify for\nsentence reductions under \u00a73582(c)(2) because their sentences were\nnot \u201cbased on\u201d their lowered Guidelines ranges. Instead, their\nsentences were \u201cbased on\u201d their mandatory minimums and on their\nsubstantial assistance to the Government.[1]AFor a sentence to be \u201cbased on\u201d a lowered\nGuidelines range, the range must have at least played \u201ca relevant\npart [in] the framework the [sentencing] judge used\u201d in imposing\nthe sentence.Hughes,ante, at 14; seeante,\nat 10\u201311. The Guidelines range will often play that part, for\ndistrict judges must calculate the defendant\u2019s advisory range and\nthen will frequently tie the sentence they impose to that range.\nSeeante, at 9\u201310; see also \u00a73553(a)(4). But that is not\nalways the case. After all, the Guidelines are advisory, and in\nsome instances they even explicitly call for the ranges to be\ntossed aside. When that happens\u2014when the ranges play no relevant\npart in the judge\u2019s determination of the defendant\u2019s ultimate\nsentence\u2014the resulting sentence is not \u201cbased on\u201d a Guidelines\nrange.Petitioners\u2019 sentences fall into this latter\ncategory of cases. Their sentences were not \u201cbased on\u201d the lowered\nGuidelines ranges because the District Court did not consider those\nranges in imposing its ultimate sentences. On the contrary, the\ncourt scrapped the ranges in favor of the mandatory minimums, and\nnever considered the ranges again; as the court explained, the\nranges dropped out of the case. App. 114\u2013115, 148, 174, 197, 216.\nAnd once out of the case, the ranges could not come close to\nforming the \u201cbasis for the sentence that the District Court\nimposed,\u201dHughes,ante, at 14, and petitioners thus\ncould not receive \u00a73582(c)(2) sentence reductions.BPetitioners\u2019 four counterarguments do not\nchange our conclusion.First, petitioners insist that because the\nGuidelines ranges serve as \u201cthe starting point for every sentencing\ncalculation in the federal system,\u201dPeughv.United\nStates, 569 U.\u00a0S. 530, 542 (2013),allsentences\nare \u201cbased on\u201d Guidelines ranges. See Brief for Petitioners 21\u201322;\nReply Brief 16\u201317. It is true that our cases require sentencing\njudges to calculate the now-advisory Guidelines range in every\nsentencing proceeding. And it is true that many judges use those\nranges as \u201cthe foundation of [their] sentencing decisions.\u201dHughes,ante, at 8.But it does not follow that any sentence\nsubsequently imposed must be regarded as \u201cbased on\u201d a Guidelines\nrange. What matters, instead, is the role that the Guidelines range\nplayed in the selection of the sentence eventually imposed\u2014not the\nrole that the range played in the initial calculation. And here,\nwhile consideration of the ranges may have served as the \u201cstarting\npoint\u201d in the sense that the court began by calculating those\nranges, the ranges clearly did not form the \u201cfoundation\u201d of the\nsentences ultimately selected. SeeHughes,ante, at\n9\u201311. In constructing a house, a builder may begin by considering\none design but may ultimately decide to use entirely different\nplans. While the first design would represent the starting point in\nthe builder\u2019s decisionmaking process, the house finally built would\nnot be \u201cbased on\u201d that design. The same is true here. Petitioners\u2019\nsentences were not \u201cbased on\u201d Guidelines ranges that the sentencing\njudge dis- carded in favor of mandatory minimums and\nsubstantial-assistance factors.Second, petitioners argue that even if their\nsentences were not actually based on their Guidelines ranges, they\nare eligible under \u00a73582(c)(2) because their sentencesshould\nhave beenbased on those ranges. See Brief for Petitioners\n25\u201334.[2] But even under that\nreading of \u201cbased on,\u201d petitioners are not eligible because the\nDistrict Court made no mistake at sentencing. Petitioners emphasize\nthat when a court departs downward because of a defendant\u2019s\nsubstantial assistance, \u00a73553(e) requires it to impose a sentence\n\u201cin accordance with the guidelines.\u201dId., at 28 (emphasis\ndeleted). But that does not mean \u201cin accordance with the guidelinesrange.\u201d Instead, a court imposes a sentence \u201cin accordance\nwith the guidelines\u201d when it follows the Guidelines\u2014including the\nparts of the Guidelines that instruct it to disregard the advisory\nranges, see USSG \u00a7\u00a71B1.1(a)(8), 5G1.1(b)\u2014in settling on a sentence.\nAnd that is precisely what the court did here. It properly\ndiscarded the advisory ranges,ibid., and permissibly\nconsidered only factors related to petitioners\u2019 substantial\nassistance, rather than factors related to the advisory ranges, as\na guide in determining how far to depart downward, USSG \u00a75K1.1. See\n\u00a73553(e).[3]Third, petitioners stress that the Sentencing\nCommission\u2019s policy statement makes clear that the Commission\nwanted defendants in their shoes to be eligible for sentence\nreductions. Brief for Petitioners 35\u201338; see USSG \u00a71B1.10(c)\n(policy statement). But the Commission\u2019s policy statement cannot\nalter \u00a73582(c)(2), which applies only when a sentence was \u201cbased\non\u201d a subsequently lowered range. The Sentencing Commission may\nlimit the application of its retroactive Guidelines amendments\nthrough its \u201c\u00a0\u2018applicable policy statements.\u2019\u00a0\u201dDillonv.United States, 560 U.\u00a0S. 817, 824\u2013826\n(2010). But policy statements cannot make a defendant eligible when\n\u00a73582(c)(2) makes him ineligible. Seeid., at 824\u2013825. In\nshort, because petitioners do not satisfy \u00a73582(c)(2)\u2019s threshold\n\u201cbased on\u201d requirement, the Commission had no power to enable their\nsentence reductions.Fourth and finally, far from creating\n\u201cunjustifiable sentencing disparities,\u201d Brief for Petitioners\n38\u201342, our ruleavoidssuch disparities. Identically\nsituated defendants sentenced today may receive the same sentences\nas petitioners received. See App. 89\u201390. Now, as then, district\ncourts calculate the advisory Guidelines ranges, see USSG\n\u00a71B1.1(a)(7); discard them in favor of the mandatory minimum\nsentences, \u00a7\u00a71B1.1(a)(8), 5G1.1(b); and then may use the\nsubstantial-assistance factors to determine how far to depart\ndownward, \u00a7\u00a71B1.1(b), 5K1.1(a). See \u00a73553(e). Those resulting\nsentences, like the sentences here, are not \u201cbased on\u201d a lowered\nGuidelines range\u2014they are \u201cbased on\u201d the defendants\u2019 mandatory\nminimums and substantial assistance to the Government. And those\ndefendants, like petitioners, are not eligible for sentence\nreductions under \u00a73582(c)(2).*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*For these reasons, we affirm.It is so ordered.Notes1The Government argues\nthat defendants subject to mandatory minimum sentences can never be\nsentenced \u201cbased on a sentencing range\u201d that the Commission has\nlowered, 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73582(c)(2), because such\ndefendants\u2019 \u201csentencing range[s]\u201d are the mandatory minimums, which\nthe Commission has no power to lower. See Brief for United States\n19\u201328. We need not resolve the meaning of \u201csentencing range\u201d today.\nEven if it referred to the discarded Guidelines range rather than\nthe mandatory minimum\u2014as petitioners contend, see Brief for\nPetitioners 20\u201321\u2014petitioners still would not be eligible for\nsentence reductions: As explained in the text that follows, their\nsentences were not \u201cbased on\u201d eventhatrange.2We assume for argument\u2019s\nsake that what should have happened at the initial sentencing\nproceedings, rather than what actually happened, matters for\npurposes of \u00a73582(c)(2). But cf.Dillonv.United\nStates, 560 U.\u00a0S. 817, 825\u2013826, 831 (2010).3Many courts have held\nthat \u00a73553(e)prohibitsconsideration of the advisory\nGuidelines ranges in determining how far to depart downward. See,e.g.,United Statesv.Spinks, 770 F.\u00a03d\n285, 287\u2013288, and n.\u00a01 (CA4 2014) (collecting cases). We take\nno view on that issue. All we must decide today is that, at the\nleast, neither \u00a73553(e) nor the Guidelinesrequiredthe\nDistrict Court to use the advisory ranges in determining how far to\ndepart downward.",
