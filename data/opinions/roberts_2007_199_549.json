JONES, PETITIONER05\u20137058v.BARBARA BOCK, WARDEN, et\u00a0al.TIMOTHY WILLIAMS, PETITIONER05\u20137142\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0v.WILLIAM S. OVERTON et\u00a0al.JOHN H. WALTON v.BARBARA BOUCHARD\net\u00a0al.on writs of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for\nthe sixth circuit[January 22, 2007]Chief Justice Roberts delivered\nthe opinion of the Court.In an effort to address the large\nnumber of prisoner complaints filed in federal court, Congress\nenacted the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PLRA), 110 Stat.\n1321\u201371, as amended, 42 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71997eet seq. Among\nother reforms, the PLRA mandates early judicial screening of\nprisoner complaints and requires prisoners to exhaust prison\ngrievance procedures before filing suit. 28 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71915A;\n42 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71997e(a). The Sixth Circuit, along with some\nother lower courts, adopted several procedural rules designed to\nimplement this exhaustion requirement and facilitate early judicial\nscreening. These rules require a prisoner to allege and demonstrate\nexhaustion in his complaint, permit suit only against defendants\nwho were identified by the prisoner in his grievance, and require\ncourts to dismiss the entire action if the prisoner fails to\nsatisfy the exhaustion requirement as to any single claim in his\ncomplaint. Other lower courts declined to adopt such rules. We\ngranted certiorari to resolve the conflict and now conclude that\nthese rules are not required by the PLRA, and that crafting and\nimposing them exceeds the proper limits on the judicial role.IPrisoner litigation continues to\n\u201caccount for an outsized share of filings\u201d in federal district\ncourts.Woodfordv.Ngo, 548 U. S. ___, ___,\nn.\u00a04 (2006) (slip op., at 12, n.\u00a04). In 2005, nearly 10\npercent of all civil cases filed in federal courts nationwide were\nprisoner complaints challenging prison conditions or claiming civil\nrights violations.[Footnote 1]\nMost of these cases have no merit; many are frivolous. Our legal\nsystem, however, remains committed to guaranteeing that prisoner\nclaims of illegal conduct by their custodians are fairly handled\naccording to law. The challenge lies in ensuring that the flood of\nnonmeritorious claims does not submerge and effectively preclude\nconsideration of the allegations with merit. SeeNeitzkev.Williams,490 U. S. 319, 327\n(1989).Congress addressed that challenge\nin the PLRA. What this country needs, Congress decided, is fewer\nand better prisoner suits. SeePorterv.Nussle,534 U. S. 516,\n524 (2002) (PLRA intended to \u201creduce the quantity and improve the\nquality of prisoner suits\u201d). To that end, Congress enacted a\nvariety of reforms designed to filter out the bad claims and\nfacilitate consideration of the good. Key among these was the\nrequirement that inmates complaining about prison conditions\nexhaust prison grievance remedies before initiating a lawsuit.The exhaustion provision of the PLRA\nstates:\u201cNo action shall be brought with respect to prison\nconditions under [42 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71983], or any other Federal\nlaw, by a prisoner confined in any jail, prison, or other\ncorrectional facility until such administrative remedies as are\navailable are exhausted.\u201d 42 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71997e(a).Requiring exhaustion allows prison officials an\nopportunity to resolve disputes concerning the exercise of their\nresponsibilities before being haled into court. This has the\npotential to reduce the number of inmate suits, and also to improve\nthe quality of suits that are filed by producing a useful\nadministrative record.Woodford,supra, at ___\n(slip op., at 12). In an attempt to implement the exhaustion\nrequirement, some lower courts have imposed procedural rules that\nhave become the subject of varying levels of disagreement among the\nfederal courts of appeals.The first question presented centers on a\nconflict over whether exhaustion under the PLRA is a pleading\nrequirement the prisoner must satisfy in his complaint or an\naffirmative defense the defendant must plead and prove.[Footnote 2] The Sixth Circuit, adopting\nthe former view, requires prisoners to attach proof of\nexhaustion\u2014typically copies of the grievances\u2014to their complaints\nto avoid dismissal. If no written record of the grievance is\navailable, the inmate must plead with specificity how and when he\nexhausted the grievance procedures.Knuckles Elv.Toombs, 215 F.\u00a03d 640, 642 (2000).The next issue concerns how courts determine\nwhether a prisoner has properly exhausted administrative\nremedies\u2014specifically, the level of detail required in a grievance\nto put the prison and individual officials on notice of the claim.\nThe Sixth Circuit requires that a prisoner have identified, in the\nfirst step of the grievance process, each individual later named in\nthe lawsuit to properly exhaust administrative remedies.Burtonv.Jones, 321 F.\u00a03d 569, 575 (2003).\nOther circuits have taken varying approaches to this question, see,e.g.,Butlerv.Adams, 397 F.\u00a03d\n1181, 1183 (CA9 2005) (proper exhaustion requires use of the\nadministrative process provided by the State; if that process does\nnot require identification of specific persons, neither does the\nPLRA);Johnsonv.Johnson, 385 F. 3d 503, 522\n(CA5 2004) (\u201c[T]he grievance must provide administrators with a\nfair opportunity under the circumstances to address the problem\nthat will later form the basis of the suit\u201d);Riccardov.Rausch, 375 F. 3d 521, 524 (CA7 2004) (exhaustion\nsatisfied if grievance \u201cserved its function of alerting the state\nand inviting corrective action\u201d), none going as far as the Sixth\nCircuit in requiring in every case that the defendants have been\nnamed from the beginning of the grievance process.Finally, the circuits are divided over what\nthe PLRA requires when both exhausted and unexhausted claims are\nincluded in a complaint.[Footnote\n3] Some circuits, including the Sixth Circuit, apply a \u201ctotal\nexhaustion\u201d rule, under which no part of the suit may proceed if\nany single claim in the action is not properly exhausted. See,e.g.,Jones Beyv.Johnson, 407\nF.\u00a03d 801, 805 (CA6 2005). Among circuits requiring total\nexhaustion there is further disagreement over what to do if the\nrequirement is not met. Most courts allow the prisoner to amend his\ncomplaint to include only exhausted claims,e.g.,Kozohorskyv.Harmon, 332 F. 3d 1141, 1144 (CA8\n2003), but the Sixth Circuit denies leave to amend, dismisses the\naction, and requires that it be filed anew with only unexhausted\nclaims,Baxterv.Rose, 305 F.\u00a03d 486, 488\n(2002);Jones Bey,supra, at 807. See alsoMcGorev.Wrigglesworth, 114 F.\u00a03d 601, 612\n(1997). Other circuits reject total exhaustion altogether, instead\ndismissing only unexhausted claims and considering the rest on the\nmerits. See,e.g.,Ortizv.McBride, 380\nF. 3d 649, 663 (CA2 2004).APetitioners are inmates in the\ncustody of the Michigan Department of Corrections (MDOC). At the\ntime petitioners filed their grievances, MDOC Policy Directive\n03.02.130 (Nov. 1, 2000) set forth the applicable grievance\nprocedures. 1 App. 138\u2013157.[Footnote 4] The policy directive describes what issues are\ngrievable and contains instructions for filing and processing\ngrievances.Inmates must first attempt to\nresolve a problem orally within two business days of becoming aware\nof the grievable issue.Id.,at 147. If oral resolution is\nunsuccessful, the inmate may proceed to Step I of the grievance\nprocess, and submit a completed grievance form within five business\ndays of the attempted oral resolution.Id.,at 147,\n149\u2013150. The Step I grievance form provided by MDOC (a one-page\nform on which the inmate fills out identifying information and is\ngiven space to describe the complaint) advises inmates to be \u201cbrief\nand concise in describing your grievance issue.\u201d 2id.,at\n1. The inmate submits the grievance to a designated grievance\ncoordinator, who assigns it to a respondent\u2014generally the\nsupervisor of the person being grieved. 1id.,at 150.If the inmate is dissatisfied with the Step I\nresponse, he may appeal to Step II by obtaining an appeal form\nwithin five business days of the response, and submitting the\nappeal within five business days of obtaining the form.Id.,at 152. The respondent at Step II is designated by\nthe policy,id.,at 152\u2013153 (e.g., the regional\nhealth administrator for medical care grievances). If still\ndissatisfied after Step II, the inmate may further appeal to Step\nIII using the same appeal form; the MDOC director is designated as\nrespondent for all Step III appeals.Id.,at 154.Lorenzo JonesPetitioner Lorenzo Jones is\nincarcerated at the MDOC\u2019s Saginaw Correctional Facility. In\nNovember 2000, while in MDOC\u2019s custody, Jones was involved in a\nvehicle accident and suffered significant injuries to his neck and\nback. Several months later Jones was given a work assignment he\nallegedly could not perform in light of his injuries. According to\nJones, respondent Paul Morrison\u2014in charge of work assignments at\nthe prison\u2014made the inappropriate assignment, even though he knew\nof Jones\u2019s injuries. When Jones reported to the assignment, he\ninformed the staff member in charge\u2014respondent Michael\nOpanasenko\u2014that he could not perform the work; Opanasenko allegedly\ntold him to do the work or \u201c\u00a0\u2018suffer the consequences.\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nId.,at 20. Jones performed the required tasks and allegedly\naggravated his injuries. After unsuccessfully seeking redress\nthrough the MDOC\u2019s grievance process, Jones filed a complaint in\nthe Eastern District of Michigan under 42 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71983 for\ndeliberate indifference to medical needs, retaliation, and\nharassment. Jones named as defendants, in addition to Morrison and\nOpanasenko, respondents Barbara Bock (the warden), Valerie Chaplin\n(a deputy warden), Janet Konkle (a registered nurse), and Ahmad\nAldabaugh (a physician).A Magistrate recommended\ndismissal for failure to state a claim with respect to Bock,\nChaplin, Konkle, and Aldabaugh, and the District Court agreed. 1\nApp. 41. With respect to Morrison and Opanasenko, however, the\nMagistrate recommended that the suit proceed, finding that Jones\nhad exhausted his administrative remedies as to those two.Id.,at 18\u201329. The District Court disagreed. In his\ncomplaint, Jones provided the dates on which his claims were filed\nat various steps of the MDOC grievance procedures.Id.,at\n41. He did not, however, attach copies of the grievance forms or\ndescribe the proceedings with specificity. Respondents attached\ncopies of all of Jones\u2019s grievances to their own motion to dismiss,\nbut the District Judge ruled that Jones\u2019s failure to meet his\nburden to plead exhaustion in his complaint could not be cured by\nrespondents.Id.,at 42. The Sixth Circuit agreed, holding\nboth that Jones failed to comply with the specific pleading\nrequirements applied to PLRA suits, 135 Fed. Appx. 837, 839 (2005)(per curiam)(citingKnuckles El, 215 F.\u00a03d,\nat 642), and that, even if Jones had shown that he exhausted the\nclaims against Morrison and Opanasenko, dismissal was still\nrequired under the total exhaustion rule, 135 Fed. Appx., at 839\n(citingJones Bey, 407 F.\u00a03d, at 806).Timothy WilliamsPetitioner Timothy Williams\nis incarcerated at the MDOC\u2019s Adrian Correctional Facility. He\nsuffers from noninvoluting cavernous hemangiomas in his right arm,\na medical condition that causes pain, immobility, and disfigurement\nof the limb, and for which he has undergone several surgeries. An\nMDOC physician recommended further surgery to provide pain relief,\nbut MDOC\u2019s Correctional Medical Services denied the recommendation\n(and subsequent appeals by the doctor) on the ground that the\ndanger of surgery outweighed the benefits, which it viewed as\ncosmetic. The MDOC Medical Services Advisory Committee upheld this\ndecision. After Correctional Medical Services indicated that it\nwould take the request under advisement, Williams filed a grievance\nobjecting to the quality of his medical care and seeking\nauthorization for the surgery. He later filed another grievance\ncomplaining that he was denied a single-occupancy handicapped cell,\nallegedly necessary to accommodate his medical condition. After\nboth grievances were denied at all stages, Williams filed a\ncomplaint in the Eastern District of Michigan under \u00a71983, naming\nas respondents William Overton (former director of MDOC), David\nJamrog (the warden), Mary Jo Pass and Paul Klee (assistant deputy\nwardens), Chad Markwell (corrections officer), Bonnie Peterson\n(health unit manager), and Dr. George Pramstaller (chief medical\nofficer for MDOC).The District Judge found that\nWilliams had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies with\nregard to his medical care claim because he had not identified any\nof the respondents named in his lawsuit during the grievance\nprocess.[Footnote 5] Although\nWilliams\u2019s claim concerning the handicapped cell had been properly\nexhausted, the District Judge\u2014applying the total exhaustion\nrule\u2014dismissed the entire suit. The Sixth Circuit affirmed. 136\nFed. Appx. 859, 861\u2013863 (2005) (citing Burton, 321 F.\u00a03d,\nat 574,Curryv.Scott, 249 F.\u00a03d 493,\n504\u2013505 (CA6 2001), andJones Bey, 407 F.\u00a03d, at\n805).John WaltonPetitioner John Walton is\nincarcerated at the MDOC\u2019s Alger Maximum Correctional Facility.\nAfter assaulting a guard, he was sanctioned with an indefinite\n\u201cupper slot\u201d restriction.[Footnote\n6] Several months later, upon learning that other prisoners had\nbeen given upper slot restrictions of only three months for the\nsame infraction, he filed a grievance claiming that this disparity\nwas the result of racial discrimination (Walton is black, the two\nother prisoners he identified in his grievances are white). After\nthe grievance was denied, Walton filed a complaint in the Western\nDistrict of Michigan under \u00a71983, claiming race discrimination. He\nnamed as respondents Barbara Bouchard (former warden), Ken Gearin,\nDavid Bergh, and Ron Bobo (assistant deputy wardens), Catherine\nBauman (resident unit manager), and Denise Gerth (assistant\nresident unit supervisor).The District Judge dismissed\nthe lawsuit because Walton had not named any respondent other than\nBobo in his grievance. His claims against the other respondents\nwere thus not properly exhausted, and the court dismissed the\nentire action under the total exhaustion rule. The Sixth Circuit\naffirmed, reiterating its requirement that a prisoner must \u201cfile a\ngrievance against the person he ultimately seeks to sue,\u201d\nCurry,supra,at 505, and that this requirement can\nonly be satisfied by naming each defendant at Step I of the MDOC\ngrievance process. Because Walton had exhausted prison remedies\nonly as to respondent Bobo, the Sixth Circuit affirmed the District\nCourt\u2019s dismissal of the entire action. 136 Fed. Appx. 846, 848\u2013849\n(2005).BJones sought review in a petition\nfor certiorari, arguing that the Sixth Circuit\u2019s heightened\npleading requirement and total exhaustion rule contravene the clear\nlanguage of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the PLRA.\nWilliams and Walton filed a joint petition under this Court\u2019s Rule\n12.4, contending that the rule requiring every defendant to be\nnamed during the grievance process is not required by the PLRA, and\nalso challenging the total exhaustion rule. We granted both\npetitions for certiorari, 547 U. S. ___ (2006), and consolidated\nthe cases for our review.IIThere is no question that\nexhaustion is mandatory under the PLRA and that unexhausted claims\ncannot be brought in court.Porter, 534 U. S., at 524.\nWhat is less clear is whether it falls to the prisoner to plead and\ndemonstrate exhaustion in the complaint, or to the defendant to\nraise lack of exhaustion as an affirmative defense. The minority\nrule, adopted by the Sixth Circuit, places the burden of pleading\nexhaustion in a case covered by the PLRA on the prisoner; most\ncourts view failure to exhaust as an affirmative defense. See\nn.\u00a02,supra.We think petitioners, and the\nmajority of courts to consider the question, have the better of the\nargument. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a) requires simply a\n\u201cshort and plain statement of the claim\u201d in a complaint, while Rule\n8(c) identifies a nonexhaustive list of affirmative defenses that\nmust be pleaded in response. The PLRA itself is not a source of a\nprisoner\u2019s claim; claims covered by the PLRA are typically brought\nunder 42 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71983, which does not require exhaustion at\nall, seePatsyv.Board of Regents of Fla.,457 U. S. 496,\n516 (1982). Petitioners assert that courts typically regard\nexhaustion as an affirmative defense in other contexts, see Brief\nfor Petitioners 34\u201336, and nn. 12\u201313 (citing cases), and\nrespondents do not seriously dispute the general proposition. We\nhave referred to exhaustion in these terms, see,e.g.,Wrightv.Universal Maritime Service Corp.,525 U. S. 70, 75\n(1998) (referring to \u201cfailure to exhaust\u201d as an \u201caffirmative\ndefens[e]\u201d), including in the similar statutory scheme governing\nhabeas corpus,Dayv.McDonough, 547 U. S. ___,\n___ (2006) (slip op., at 8) (referring to exhaustion as a\n\u201cdefense\u201d).The PLRA dealt extensively with the subject of\nexhaustion, see 42 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a71997e(a), (c)(2), but is silent\non the issue whether exhaustion must be pleaded by the plaintiff or\nis an affirmative defense. This is strong evidence that the usual\npractice should be followed, and the usual practice under the\nFederal Rules is to regard exhaustion as an affirmative\ndefense.In a series of recent cases, we have explained\nthat courts should generally not depart from the usual practice\nunder the Federal Rules on the basis of perceived policy concerns.\nThus, inLeathermanv.Tarrant County Narcotics\nIntelligence and Coordination Unit,507 U. S. 163(1993), we\nunanimously reversed the court of appeals for imposing a heightened\npleading standard in \u00a71983 suits against municipalities. We\nexplained that \u201c[p]erhaps if [the] Rules \u2026 were rewritten today,\nclaims against municipalities under \u00a71983 might be subjected to the\nadded specificity requirement \u2026\u00a0. But that is a result which\nmust be obtained by the process of amending the Federal Rules, and\nnot by judicial interpretation.\u201dId.,at 168.InSwierkiewiczv.Sorema\nN.\u00a0A.,534\nU. S. 506(2002), we unanimously reversed the court of appeals\nfor requiring employment discrimination plaintiffs to specifically\nallege the elements of a prima facie case of discrimination. We\nexplained that \u201cthe Federal Rules do not contain a heightened\npleading standard for employment discrimination suits,\u201d and a\n\u201crequirement of greater specificity for particular claims\u201d must be\nobtained by amending the Federal Rules.Id.,at 515\n(citingLeatherman). And just last Term, inHillv.McDonough, 547 U. S. ___ (2006), we unanimously\nrejected a proposal that \u00a71983 suits challenging a method of\nexecution must identify an acceptable alternative: \u201cSpecific\npleading requirements are mandated by the Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure, and not, as a general rule, through case-by-case\ndeterminations of the federal courts.\u201dId.,at ___ (slip\nop., at 8) (citingSwierkiewicz).The Sixth Circuit and other courts requiring\nprisoners to plead and demonstrate exhaustion in their complaints\ncontend that if the \u201cnew regime\u201d mandated by the PLRA for prisoner\ncomplaints is to function effectively, prisoner complaints must be\ntreated outside of this typical framework. SeeBaxter, 305\nF.\u00a03d, at 489. These courts explain that the PLRA not only\nimposed a new mandatory exhaustion requirement, but also departed\nin a fundamental way from the usual procedural ground rules by\nrequiring judicial screening to filter out nonmeritorious claims:\nCourts are to screen inmate complaints \u201cbefore docketing, if\nfeasible, or \u2026 as soon as practicable after docketing,\u201d and dismiss\nthe complaint if it is \u201cfrivolous, malicious, \u2026 fails to state a\nclaim upon which relief may be granted[,] or \u2026 seeks monetary\nrelief from a defendant who is immune from such relief.\u201d 28 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a71915A(a), (b). All this may take place before any\nresponsive pleading is filed\u2014unlike in the typical civil case,\ndefendants do not have to respond to a complaint covered by the\nPLRA until required to do so by the court, and waiving the right to\nreply does not constitute an admission of the allegations in the\ncomplaint. See 42 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71997e(g)(1), (2). According to\nrespondents, these departures from the normal litigation framework\nof complaint and response mandate a different pleading requirement\nfor prisoner complaints, if the screening is to serve its intended\npurpose. See,e.g.,Baxter,supra,at\n489 (\u201cThis court\u2019s heightened pleading standards for complaints\ncovered by the PLRA are designed to facilitate the Act\u2019s screening\nrequirements \u2026\u201d);Knuckles El, 215 F.\u00a03d, at 642. See\nalso Brief for Respondents 17.We think that the PLRA\u2019s screening requirement\ndoes not\u2014explicitly or implicitly\u2014justify deviating from the usual\nprocedural practice beyond the departures specified by the PLRA\nitself. Before the PLRA, thein forma pauperisprovision\nof \u00a71915, applicable to most prisoner litigation, permittedsua\nspontedismissal only if an action was frivolous or malicious.\n28 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71915(d) (1994 ed.); see alsoNeitzke,\n490 U. S., at 320 (concluding that a complaint that fails to state\na claim was not frivolous under \u00a71915(d) and thus could not be\ndismissedsua sponte). In the PLRA, Congress added failure\nto state a claim and seeking monetary relief from a defendant\nimmune from such relief as grounds forsua spontedismissal ofin forma pauperiscases, \u00a71915(e)(2)(B) (2000\ned.), and provided for judicial screening andsU. S.ontedismissal of prisoner suits on the same four grounds, \u00a71915A(b); 42\nU. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71997e(c)(1). Although exhaustion was a \u201ccenterpiece\u201d\nof the PLRA,Woodford, 548 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at\n1\u20132), failure to exhaust was notably not added in terms to this\nenumeration. There is thus no reason to suppose that the normal\npleading rules have to be altered to facilitate judicial screening\nof complaints specifically for failure to exhaust.Some courts have found that exhaustion is\nsubsumed under the PLRA\u2019s enumerated ground authorizing early\ndismissal for \u201cfail[ure] to state a claim upon which relief may be\ngranted.\u201d 28 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a71915A(b)(1), 1915(e)(2)(B); 42 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a71997e(c)(1). SeeBaxter,supra,at\n489;Steelev.Federal Bureau of Prisons, 355\nF.\u00a03d 1204, 1210 (CA10 2003);Riverav.Allin, 144 F.\u00a03d 719, 731 (CA11 1998). The point is a\nbit of a red herring. A complaint is subject to dismissal for\nfailure to state a claim if the allegations, taken as true, show\nthe plaintiff is not entitled to relief. If the allegations, for\nexample, show that relief is barred by the applicable statute of\nlimitations, the complaint is subject to dismissal for failure to\nstate a claim; that does not make the statute of limitations any\nless an affirmative defense, see Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 8(c). Whether\na particular ground for opposing a claim may be the basis for\ndismissal for failure to state a claim depends on whether the\nallegations in the complaint suffice to establish that ground, not\non the nature of the ground in the abstract. SeeLevetov.Lapina, 258 F.\u00a03d 156, 161 (CA3 2001) (\u201c[A] complaint\nmay be subject to dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) when an affirmative\ndefense \u2026 appears on its face\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).\nSee alsoLopez-Gonzalezv.Municipality of\nComerio, 404 F.\u00a03d 548, 551 (CA1 2005) (dismissing a\ncomplaint barred by the statute of limitations under Rule\n12(b)(6));Paniv.Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield,\n152 F.\u00a03d 67, 74\u201375 (CA2 1998) (dismissing a complaint barred\nby official immunity under Rule 12(b)(6)). See also 5B C. Wright\n& A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a71357,\npp.\u00a0708\u2013710, 721\u2013729 (3d ed. 2004). Determining that Congress\nmeant to include failure to exhaust under the rubric of \u201cfailure to\nstate a claim\u201d in the screening provisions of the PLRA would thus\nnot support treating exhaustion as a pleading requirement rather\nthan an affirmative defense.The argument that screening would be more\neffective if exhaustion had to be shown in the complaint proves too\nmuch; the same could be said with respect to any affirmative\ndefense. The rejoinder that the PLRA focused on exhaustion rather\nthan other defenses simply highlights the failure of Congress to\ninclude exhaustion in terms among the enumerated grounds justifying\ndismissal upon early screening. As noted, that is not to say that\nfailure to exhaust cannot be a basis for dismissal for failure to\nstate a claim. It is to say that there is no basis for concluding\nthat Congress implicitly meant to transform exhaustion from an\naffirmative defense to a pleading requirement by the curiously\nindirect route of specifying that courts should screen PLRA\ncomplaints and dismiss those that fail to state a claim.Respondents point to 42 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a71997e(g) as confirming that the usual pleading rules should not\napply to PLRA suits, but we think that provision supports\npetitioners. It specifies that defendants can waive their right to\nreply to a prisoner complaint without the usual consequence of\nbeing deemed to have admitted the allegations in the complaint. See\n\u00a71997e(g)(1) (allowing defendants to waive their response without\nadmitting the allegations \u201c[n]otwithstanding any other law or rule\nof procedure\u201d). This shows that when Congress meant to depart from\nthe usual procedural requirements, it did so expressly.We conclude that failure to exhaust is an\naffirmative defense under the PLRA, and that inmates are not\nrequired to specially plead or demonstrate exhaustion in their\ncomplaints. We understand the reasons behind the decisions of some\nlower courts to impose a pleading requirement on plaintiffs in this\ncontext, but that effort cannot fairly be viewed as an\ninterpretation of the PLRA. \u201cWhatever temptations the statesmanship\nof policy-making might wisely suggest,\u201d the judge\u2019s job is to\nconstrue the statute\u2014not to make it better. Frankfurter, Some\nReflections on the Reading of Statutes, 47 Colum. L.\u00a0Rev. 527,\n533 (1947).

SeeUnited Statesv.Goldenberg,168 U.

Given that the PLRA does not itself\nrequire plaintiffs to plead exhaustion, such a result \u201cmust be\nobtained by the process of amending the Federal Rules, and not by\njudicial interpretation.\u201dLeatherman, 507 U. S., at\n168.IIIThe Sixth Circuit threw out the\nWilliams and Walton suits because those prisoners had not\nidentified in their initial grievances each defendant they later\nsued. 136 Fed. Appx., at 862\u2013863;id.,at 848\u2013849. SeeBurton, 321 F.\u00a03d, at 575.[Footnote 7] Here again the lower court\u2019s procedural\nrule lacks a textual basis in the PLRA. The PLRA requires\nexhaustion of \u201csuch administrative remedies as are available,\u201d 42\nU. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71997e(a), but nothing in the statute imposes a \u201cname\nall defendants\u201d requirement along the lines of the Sixth Circuit\u2019s\njudicially created rule. Respondents argue that without such a rule\nthe exhaustion requirement would become a \u201c\u00a0\u2018useless\nappendage,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Brief for Respondents 44 (quotingWoodford, 548 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 11)), but the\nassertion is hyperbole, and the citation ofWoodfordmisplaced.Woodfordheld that\n\u201cproper exhaustion\u201d was required under the PLRA, and that this\nrequirement was not satisfied when grievances were dismissed\nbecause prisoners had missed deadlines set by the grievance policy.Id.,at ___ (slip op., at 11\u201313).At the time\neach of the grievances at issue here was filed, in contrast, the\nMDOC policy did not contain any provision specifying who must be\nnamed in a grievance. MDOC\u2019s policy required only that prisoners\n\u201cbe as specific as possible\u201d in their grievances, 1 App. 148, while\nat the same time the required forms advised them to \u201c[b]e brief and\nconcise.\u201d 2id., at 1. The MDOC grievance form does not\nrequire a prisoner to identify a particular responsible party, and\nthe respondent is not necessarily the allegedly culpable prison\nofficial, but rather an administrative official designated in the\npolicy to respond to particular types of grievances at different\nlevels.Supra, at 6. The grievance policy specifically\nprovides that the grievant at Step I \u201cshall have the opportunity to\nexplain the grievance more completely at [an] interview, enabling\nthe Step I respondent to gather any additional information needed\nto respond to the grievance.\u201d 1 App. 151. Nothing in the MDOC\npolicy itself supports the conclusion that the grievance process\nwas improperly invoked simply because an individual later named as\na defendant was not named at the first step of the grievance\nprocess.Nor does the PLRA impose such a requirement.\nInWoodford, we held that to properly exhaust\nadministrative remedies prisoners must \u201ccomplete the administrative\nreview process in accordance with the applicable procedural rules,\u201d\n548 U. S., at __ (slip op., at 5)\u2014rules that are defined not by the\nPLRA, but by the prison grievance process itself. Compliance with\nprison grievance procedures, therefore, is all that is required by\nthe PLRA to \u201cproperly exhaust.\u201d The level of detail necessary in a\ngrievance to comply with the grievance procedures will vary from\nsystem to system and claim to claim, but it is the prison\u2019s\nrequirements, and not the PLRA, that define the boundaries of\nproper exhaustion. As the MDOC\u2019s procedures make no mention of\nnaming particular officials, the Sixth Circuit\u2019s rule imposing such\na prerequisite to proper exhaustion is unwarranted.We have identified the benefits of exhaustion\nto include allowing a prison to address complaints about the\nprogram it administers before being subjected to suit, reducing\nlitigation to the extent complaints are satisfactorily resolved,\nand improving litigation that does occur by leading to the\npreparation of a useful record. Seeid., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 6\u20138);Porter, 534 U. S., at 524\u2013525. The Sixth Circuit\nrule may promote early notice to those who might later be sued, but\nthat has not been thought to be one of the leading purposes of the\nexhaustion requirement. SeeJohnson, 385 F.\u00a03d, at\n522 (\u201cWe are mindful that the primary purpose of a grievance is to\nalert prison officials to a problem, not to provide personal notice\nto a particular official that he may be sued; the grievance is not\na summons and complaint that initiates adversarial litigation\u201d);\nsee also Brief for American Civil Liberties Union et\u00a0al. asAmici Curiae8\u20139, and n.\u00a06 (collecting grievance\nprocedures and noting that the majority do not require prisoners to\nidentify specific individuals).We do not determine whether the grievances\nfiled by petitioners satisfied the requirement of \u201cproper\nexhaustion,\u201dWoodford,supra, at ___ (slip op.,\nat 11), but simply conclude that exhaustion is notper seinadequate simply because an individual later sued was not named in\nthe grievances. We leave it to the court below in the first\ninstance to determine the sufficiency of the exhaustion in these\ncases.IVThe final issue concerns how\ncourts should address complaints in which the prisoner has failed\nto exhaust some, but not all, of the claims asserted in the\ncomplaint.[Footnote 8] All\nagree that no unexhausted claim may be considered. The issue is\nwhether the court should proceed with the exhausted claims, or\ninstead\u2014as the Sixth Circuit has held\u2014dismiss the entire action if\nany one claim is not properly exhausted. SeeJones Bey,\n407 F.\u00a03d, at 807.[Footnote\n9]Here the Sixth Circuit can point\nto language in the PLRA in support of its rule. Section 1997e(a)\nprovides that \u201c[n]o action shall be brought\u201d unless administrative\nprocedures are exhausted. Respondents argue that if Congress\nintended courts to dismiss only unexhausted claims while retaining\nthe balance of the lawsuit, the word \u201cclaim\u201d rather than \u201caction\u201d\nwould have been used in this provision.This statutory phrasing\u2014\u201cno action shall be\nbrought\u201d\u2014is boilerplate language. There are many instances in the\nFederal Code where similar language is used, but such language has\nnot been thought to lead to the dismissal of an entire action if a\nsingle claim fails to meet the pertinent standards. Statutes of\nlimitations, for example, are often introduced by a variant of the\nphrase \u201cno action shall be brought,\u201d see,e.g.,Beachv.Ocwen Fed. Bank,523 U. S. 410, 416\n(1998); 18 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71030(g) (2000 ed., Supp. IV), but we have\nnever heard of an entire complaint being thrown out simply because\none of several discrete claims was barred by the statute of\nlimitations, and it is hard to imagine what purpose such a rule\nwould serve. The same is true with respect to other uses of the \u201cno\naction shall be brought\u201d phrasing. See,e.g.,Hawksbill Sea Turtlev.Federal Emergency Management\nAgency, 126 F. 3d 461, 471 (CA3 1997) (dismissing only claims\nthat fail to comply with the citizen suit notification requirement\nof 16 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71540(g)(2), which states that \u201c[n]o action may\nbe commenced\u201d until an agency has declined to act after being given\nwritten notice).More generally, statutory references to an\n\u201caction\u201d have not typically been read to mean that every claim\nincluded in the action must meet the pertinent requirement before\nthe \u201caction\u201d may proceed. See,e.g.,Exxon Mobil\nCorp.v.Allapattah Services, Inc.,545 U. S. 546, 560\u2013563\n(2005) (District Court had jurisdiction over a \u201ccivil action\u201d under\n28 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71367(a), even if it might not have jurisdiction\nover each separate claim comprising the action);Chicagov.International College of Surgeons,522 U. S. 156, 166\n(1997) (District Court had jurisdiction over removed \u201ccivil action\u201d\neven if every claim did not satisfy jurisdictional\nprerequisites).As a general matter, if a complaint contains\nboth good and bad claims, the court proceeds with the good and\nleaves the bad. \u201c[O]nly the bad claims are dismissed; the complaint\nas a whole is not. If Congress meant to depart from this norm, we\nwould expect some indication of that, and we find none.\u201dRobinsonv.Page, 170 F.\u00a03d 747, 748\u2013749\n(CA7 1999) (considering \u00a71997e(e)).Respondents note an exception to this general\nrule, the total exhaustion rule in habeas corpus. InRosev.Lundy,455 U. S. 509, 522\n(1982), we held that \u201cmixed\u201d habeas petitions\u2014containing both\nexhausted and unexhausted claims\u2014cannot be adjudicated. This total\nexhaustion rule applied in habeas was initially derived from\nconsiderations of \u201ccomity and federalism,\u201d not any statutory\ncommand.Rhinesv.Weber,544 U. S. 269, 273\n(2005);id.,at 274 (noting that Congress \u201cpreservedLundy\u2019s total exhaustion requirement\u201d in 28 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a72254(b)(1)(A)). Separate claims in a single habeas petition\ngenerally seek the same relief from custody, and success on one is\noften as good as success on another. In such a case it makes sense\nto require exhaustion of all claims in state court before allowing\nthe federal action to proceed. A typical PLRA suit with multiple\nclaims, on the other hand, may combine a wide variety of discrete\ncomplaints, about interactions with guards, prison conditions,\ngenerally applicable rules, and so on, seeking different relief on\neach claim. There is no reason failure to exhaust on one\nnecessarily affects any other. In any event, even if the habeas\ntotal exhaustion rule is pertinent, it does not in fact depart from\nthe usual practice\u2014as we recently held, a court presented with a\nmixed habeas petition \u201cshould allow the petitioner to delete the\nunexhausted claims and to proceed with the exhausted claims\n\u2026\u00a0.\u201dRhines,supra, at 278. This is the\nopposite of the rule the Sixth Circuit adopted, and precisely the\nrule that respondents argue against.Respondents\u2019 reading of 42 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a71997e(a) to contain a total exhaustion rule is bolstered by the\nfact that other sections of the PLRA distinguish between actions\nand claims. Section 1997e(c)(1), for example, provides that a court\nshall dismiss anactionfor one of four enumerated\ndeficiencies, while \u00a71997e(c)(2) allows a court to dismiss aclaimfor one of these reasons without first determining\nwhether the claim is exhausted. Similarly, 28 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a71915A(b) directs district courts to dismiss \u201cthe complaint, or any\nportion of the complaint\u201d before docketing under certain\ncircumstances. This demonstrates that Congress knew how to\ndifferentiate between the entire action and particular claims when\nit wanted to, and suggests that its use of \u201caction\u201d rather than\n\u201cclaim\u201d in 42 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71997e(a) should be given effect.But the interpretation respondents advocate\ncreates its own inconsistencies. Section 1997e(e) contains similar\nlanguage, \u201c[n]o \u2026 action may be brought \u2026 for mental or emotional\ninjury suffered while in custody without a prior showing of\nphysical injury,\u201d yet respondents cite no case interpreting this\nprovision to require dismissal of the entire lawsuit if only one\nclaim does not comply, and again we see little reason for such an\napproach. Accord,Cassidyv.Indiana Dept. of\nCorrections, 199 F.\u00a03d 374, 376\u2013377 (CA7 2000)\n(dismissing only the portions of the complaint barred by\n\u00a71997e(e)); see alsoWilliamsv.Ollis, 230\nF.\u00a03d 1361 (CA6 2000) (unpublished table decision) (same).\nInterpreting the phrase \u201cno action shall be brought\u201d to require\ndismissal of the entire case under \u00a71997e(a) but not \u00a71997e(e)\nwould contravene our normal rules of statutory construction.National Credit Union Admin.v.First Nat. Bank &\nTrust Co.,522\nU. S. 479, 501\u2013502 (1998).In pressing the total exhaustion argument,\nrespondents also marshal the policy and purpose underlying the\nPLRA\u2014this time in a supporting rather than lead role. The\ninvigorated exhaustion requirement is a \u201ccenterpiece\u201d of the\nstatute,Woodford, 548 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 1\u20132),\nand if the exhaustion requirement of \u00a71997e(a) is not effectuated\nby a total exhaustion rule, they argue, inmates will have little\nincentive to ensure that they have exhausted all available\nadministrative remedies before proceeding to court. The PLRA\nmandated early judicial screening to reduce the burden of prisoner\nlitigation on the courts; a total exhaustion rule allows courts\npromptly to dismiss an action upon identifying an unexhausted\nclaim. The alternative approach turns judges into editors of\nprisoner complaints, rather than creating an incentive for\nprisoners to exhaust properly. SeeRossv.County of\nBernalillo, 365 F.\u00a03d 1181, 1190 (CA10 2004).We are not persuaded by these policy\narguments. In fact, the effect of a total exhaustion rule could be\nthat inmates will file various claims in separate suits, to avoid\nthe possibility of an unexhausted claim tainting the others. That\nwould certainly not comport with the purpose of the PLRA to reduce\nthe quantity of inmate suits. Additionally, district judges who\ndelve into a prisoner complaint only to realize it contains an\nunexhausted claim, requiring dismissal of the entire complaint\nunder the total exhaustion rule, will often have to begin the\nprocess all over again when the prisoner refiles. In light of\ntypically short prison grievance time limits, prisoners\u2019 refiled\ncomplaints will often be identical to what the district court would\nhave considered had it simply dismissed unexhausted claims as it\nencountered them and proceeded with the exhausted ones. Perhaps\nfiling fees and concerns about the applicability of the \u201cthree\nstrikes\u201d rule, 28 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71915(g), would mitigate these\neffects, but the debate about consequences is close enough that\nthere is no clear reason to depart from the more typical\nclaim-by-claim approach.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*We are not insensitive to the\nchallenges faced by the lower federal courts in managing their\ndockets and attempting to separate, when it comes to prisoner\nsuits, not so much wheat from chaff as needles from haystacks. We\nonce again reiterate, however\u2014as we did unanimously inLeatherman,Swierkiewicz, andHill\u2014that\nadopting different and more onerous pleading rules to deal with\nparticular categories of cases should be done through established\nrulemaking procedures, and not on a case-by-case basis by the\ncourts.The judgments of the United\nStates Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit are reversed, and the\ncases are remanded for further proceedings consistent with this\nopinion.It is so ordered.Footnote 1See Administrative Office of the United\nStates Courts, Judicial Facts and Figures, Tables 4.4, 4.6,\nhttp://www.uscourts.gov/ judicialfactsfigures/contents.html (as\nvisited Jan. 17, 2007, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case\nfile).

See Policy\nDirective 03.02.130 (effective Dec. 19, 2003), App. to Brief for\nRespondents 1b. The new policy is not at issue in these cases.Footnote 5Dr. Pramstaller was mentioned at Step III of\nthe grievance process, but was apparently never served with the\ncomplaint initiating the lawsuit. The Magistrate stated that even\nif the claims against Pramstaller had been properly exhausted they\nnonetheless were subject to dismissal under the total exhaustion\nrule. 1 App. 86, 101. It also appears that under the Sixth\nCircuit\u2019s rule requiring a defendant to be named at Step I of the\ngrievance process, the claims against Pramstaller, who was not\nmentioned until Step III, would not have been exhausted. Seesupra, at 4; n.\u00a07,infra.

Presumably, this is less desirable\nthan access through the upper slot; the record does not reveal how\neffective this particular sanction is in discouraging assaults on\nstaff.Footnote 7This \u201cname all defendants\u201d rule\napparently applies even when a prisoner does not learn the identity\nof the responsible party until a later step of the grievance\nprocess.

In Jones\u2019s case, the Sixth\nCircuit ruled in the alternative that total exhaustion required\ndismissal. 135 Fed.
