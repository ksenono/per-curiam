GILL, et\u00a0al., APPELLANTSv.WILLIAM WHITFORD, et\u00a0al.on appeal from the united states district\ncourt for the western district of wisconsin[June 18, 2018]Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Gorsuch\njoins, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.I join Parts I and II of the Court\u2019s opinion\nbecause I agree that the plaintiffs have failed to prove Article\nIII standing. I do not join Part III, which gives the plaintiffs\nanother chance to prove their standing on remand. When a plaintiff\nlacks standing, our ordinary practice is to remand the case with\ninstructions to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.E.g.,Lancev.Coffman, 549 U.\u00a0S. 437, 442 (2007)\n(per curiam);DaimlerChrysler Corp.v.Cuno,\n547 U.\u00a0S. 332, 354 (2006);United Statesv.Hays, 515 U.\u00a0S. 737, 747 (1995). The Court departs from\nour usual practice because this is supposedly \u201cnot the usual case.\u201dAnte,at 21. But there is nothing unusual about it. As the\nCourt explains, the plaintiffs\u2019 lack of standing follows from\nlong-established principles of law. Seeante,at 13\u201317.\nAfter a year and a half of litigation in the District Court,\nincluding a 4-day trial, the plaintiffs had a more-than-ample\nopportunity to prove their standing under these principles. They\nfailed to do so. Accordingly, I would have remanded this case with\ninstructions to dismiss.",
