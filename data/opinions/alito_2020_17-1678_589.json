HERNANDEZ, et\u00a0al., PETITIONERSv.JESUS MESA, Jr.on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the fifth circuit[February 25, 2020]Justice Alito delivered the opinion of the\nCourt.We are asked in this case to extendBivensv.Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents,403 U.S.\n388(1971), and create a damages remedy for a cross-border\nshooting. As we have made clear in many prior cases, however, the\nConstitution\u2019s separation of powers requires us to exercise caution\nbefore extendingBivensto a new \u201ccontext,\u201d and a claim\nbased on a cross-border shooting arises in a context that is\nmarkedly new. Unlike any previously recognizedBivensclaim,\na cross-border shooting claim has foreign relations and national\nsecurity implications. In addition, Congress has been notably\nhesitant to create claims based on allegedly tortious conduct\nabroad. Because of the distinctive characteristics of cross-border\nshooting claims, we refuse to extendBivensinto this new\nfield.IThe facts of this tragic case are set forth in\nour earlier opinion in this matter,Hern\u00e1ndezv.Mesa, 582 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2017) (per\u00a0curiam).\nSergio Adri\u00e1n Hern\u00e1ndez G\u00fcereca, a 15-year-old Mexican national,\nwas with a group of friends in a concrete culvert that separates El\nPaso, Texas, from Ciudad Juarez, Mexico. The border runs through\nthe center of the culvert, which was designed to hold the waters of\nthe Rio Grande River but is now largely dry. Border Patrol Agent\nJesus Mesa, Jr., detained one of Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s friends who had run\nonto the United States\u2019 side of the culvert. After Hern\u00e1ndez, who\nwas also on the United States\u2019 side, ran back across the culvert\nonto Mexican soil, Agent Mesa fired two shots at Hern\u00e1ndez; one\nstruck and killed him on the other side of the border.Petitioners and Agent Mesa disagree about what\nHern\u00e1ndez and his friends were doing at the time of shooting.\nAccording to petitioners, they were simply playing a game, running\nacross the culvert, touching the fence on the U.\u00a0S. side, and\nthen running back across the border. According to Agent Mesa,\nHern\u00e1ndez and his friends were involved in an illegal border\ncrossing attempt, and they pelted him with rocks.[1]The shooting quickly became an international\nincident, with the United States and Mexico disagreeing about how\nthe matter should be handled. On the United States\u2019 side, the\nDepartment of Justice conducted an investigation. When it finished,\nthe Department, while expressing regret over Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s death,\nconcluded that Agent Mesa had not violated Customs and Border\nPatrol policy or training, and it declined to bring charges or take\nother action against him. Mexico was not and is not satisfied with\nthe U.\u00a0S. investigation. It requested that Agent Mesa be\nextradited to face criminal charges in a Mexican court, a request\nthat the United States has denied.Petitioners, Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s parents, were also\ndissatisfiedand therefore brought suit for damages in the\nUnited States District Court for the Western District of Texas.\nAmong other claims, they sought recovery of damages underBivens, alleging that Mesa violated Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s Fourth and\nFifth Amendment rights. The District Court granted Mesa\u2019s motion to\ndismiss, and the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit sitting en\nbanc has twice affirmed this dismissal.On the first occasion, the court held that\nHern\u00e1ndez was not entitled to Fourth Amendment protection because\nhe was \u201ca Mexican citizen who had no \u2018significant voluntary\nconnection\u2019 to the United States\u201d and \u201cwas on Mexican soil at the\ntime he was shot.\u201dHernandezv.United States, 785\nF.3d 117, 119 (CA5 2015) (per curiam). It further concluded\nthat Mesa was entitled to qualified immunity on petitioners\u2019 Fifth\nAmendment claim.Id.,at 120.After granting review, we vacated the Fifth\nCircuit\u2019s decision and remanded the case, instructing the court \u201cto\nconsider how the reasoning and analysis\u201d ofZiglarv.Abbasi, 582 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2017), our most recent\nexplication ofBivens, \u201c[might] bear on this case.\u201dHern\u00e1ndez, 582 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 5). We found\nit \u201cappropriate for the Court of Appeals, rather than this Court,\nto address theBivensquestion in the first instance.\u201dIbid.And with theBivensissue unresolved, we\nthought it \u201cimprudent\u201d to resolve the \u201csensitive\u201d question whether\nthe Fourth Amendment applies to a cross-border shooting.Ibid.In addition, while rejecting the ground on which the\nCourt of Appeals had held that Agent Mesa was entitled to qualified\nimmunity, we declined to decide whether he was entitled to\nqualified immunity on a different ground or whether petitioners\u2019\nclaim was cognizable under the Fifth Amendment.Id.,at\n___\u2013___ (slip op., at 5\u20136).On remand, the en banc Fifth Circuit evaluated\npetitioners\u2019 case in light ofAbbasiand refused to\nrecognize aBivensclaim for a cross-border shooting. 885\nF.3d 811 (CA5 2018). The court reasoned that such an incident\npresents a \u201c\u00a0\u2018new context\u2019\u00a0\u201d and that multiple\nfactors\u2014including the incident\u2019s relationship to foreign affairs\nand national security, the extraterritorial aspect of the case, and\nCongress\u2019s \u201crepeated refusals\u201d to create a damages remedy for\ninjuries incurred on foreign soil\u2013\u2013counseled against an extension\nofBivens. 885 F.\u00a03d, at 816\u2013823.We granted certiorari, 587 U.\u00a0S. ___\n(2019), and now affirm.IIInBivensv.Six Unknown Fed.\nNarcotics Agents,403 U.S.\n388, the Court broke new ground by holding that a person\nclaiming to be the victim of an unlawful arrest and search could\nbring a Fourth Amendment claim for damages against the responsible\nagents even though no federal statute authorized such a claim. The\nCourt subsequently extendedBivensto cover two additional\nconstitutional claims: inDavisv.Passman,442 U.S.\n228(1979), a former congressional staffer\u2019s Fifth Amendment\nclaim of dismissal based on sex, and inCarlsonv.Green,446 U.S.\n14(1980), a federal prisoner\u2019s Eighth Amendment claim for\nfailure to provide adequate medical treatment. After those\ndecisions, however, the Court changed course.Bivens,Davis, andCarlsonwere the products of an era when the Court routinely inferred\n\u201ccauses of action\u201d that were \u201cnot explicit\u201d in the text of the\nprovision that was allegedly violated.Abbasi, 582\nU.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 8). AsAbbasirecounted:\u201cDuring this \u2018ancien regime,\u2019\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. the Court assumed it to be a proper judicial\nfunction to \u2018provide such remedies as are necessary to make\neffective\u2019 a statute\u2019s purpose .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. Thus, as a\nroutine matter with respect to statutes, the Court would imply\ncauses of action not explicit in the statutory text itself.\u201dIbid.(quotingAlexanderv.Sandoval,532 U.S.\n275, 287 (2001);J.I. Case Co.v.Borak,377 U.S.\n426, 433 (1964)).Bivensextended this practice to claims\nbased on the Constitution itself. 582 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 8);Bivens, 403 U.\u00a0S., at 402 (Harlan, J.,\nconcurring in judgment) (Court can infer availability of damages\nwhen, \u201cin its view, damages are necessary to effectuate\u201d the\n\u201cpolicy underpinning the substantive provisio[n]\u201d).In later years, we came to appreciate more fully\nthe tension between this practice and the Constitution\u2019s separation\nof legislative and judicial power. The Constitution grants\nlegislative power to Congress; this Court and the lower federal\ncourts, by contrast, have only \u201cjudicial Power.\u201d Art. III, \u00a71. But\nwhen a court recognizes an implied claim for damages on the ground\nthat doing so furthers the \u201cpurpose\u201d of the law, the court risks\narrogating legislative power. No law \u201c\u00a0\u2018pursues its purposes\nat all costs.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAmerican Express Co.v.Italian\nColors Restaurant,570 U.S.\n228, 234 (2013) (quotingRodriguezv.United\nStates,480 U.S.\n522, 525\u2013526 (1987) (per curiam)). Instead, lawmaking\ninvolves balancing interests and often demands compromise. SeeBoard of Governors, FRSv.Dimension Financial Corp.,474 U.S.\n361, 373\u2013374 (1986). Thus, a lawmaking body that enacts a\nprovision that creates a right or prohibits specified conduct may\nnot wish to pursue the provision\u2019s purpose to the extent of\nauthorizing private suits for damages. For this reason, finding\nthat a damages remedy is implied by a provision that makes no\nreference to that remedy may upset the careful balance of interests\nstruck by the lawmakers. Seeibid.This problem does not exist when a common-law\ncourt, which exercises a degree of lawmaking authority, fleshes out\nthe remedies available for a common-law tort. AnalogizingBivensto the work of a common-law court, petitioners and\nsome of theiramicimake much of the fact that common-law\nclaims against federal officers for intentional torts were once\navailable. See,e.g., Brief for Petitioners 10\u201320. ButErie R.\u00a0Co.v.Tompkins,304 U.S.\n64, 78 (1938), held that \u201c[t]here is no federal general common\nlaw,\u201d and therefore federal courts today cannot fashion new claims\nin the way that they could before 1938. SeeAlexander, 532\nU.\u00a0S., at 287 (\u201c\u00a0\u2018Raising up causes of action where a\nstatute has not created them may be a proper function for\ncommon-law courts, but not for federal tribunals\u2019\u00a0\u201d).With the demise of federal general common law, a\nfederal court\u2019s authority to recognize a damages remedy must rest\nat bottom on a statute enacted by Congress, seeid.,at 286\n(\u201cprivate rights of action to enforce federal law must be created\nby Congress\u201d), and no statute expressly creates aBivensremedy. Justice Harlan\u2019sBivensconcurrence argued that this\npower is inherent in the grant of federal question jurisdiction,\nsee 403 U.\u00a0S., at 396 (majority opinion);id., at 405\n(opinion of Harlan, J.), but our later cases have demanded a\nclearer manifestation of congressional intent, seeAbbasi,\n582 U.\u00a0S., at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 10\u201312).In both statutory and constitutional cases, our\nwatchword is caution. For example, inJesnerv.Arab\nBank, PLC, 584 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___\u2013___ (2018) (slip op., at\n18\u201319) we expressed doubt about our authority to recognize any\ncauses of action not expressly created by Congress. See alsoAbbasi,582 U.\u00a0S.,at___(slip op., at\n9) (\u201cIf the statute does not itself so provide, a private cause of\naction will not be created through judicial mandate\u201d). And we\ndeclined to recognize a claim against a foreign corporation under\nthe Alien Tort Statute.Jesner, 584 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 29).In constitutional cases, we have been at least\nequally reluctant to create new causes of action. We have\nrecognized that Congress is best positioned to evaluate \u201cwhether,\nand the extent to which, monetary and other liabilities should be\nimposed upon individual officers and employees of the Federal\nGovernment\u201d based on constitutional torts.Abbasi, 582\nU.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 10). We have stated that expansion\nofBivensis \u201ca \u2018disfavored\u2019 judicial activity,\u201d 582\nU.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 11) (quotingAshcroftv.Iqbal,556 U.S.\n662, 675 (2009)), and have gone so far as to observe that if\n\u201cthe Court\u2019s threeBivenscases [had] been .\u00a0.\u00a0.\ndecided today,\u201d it is doubtful that we would have reached the same\nresult, 582 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 11). And for almost 40\nyears, we have consistently rebuffed requests to add to the claims\nallowed underBivens. See 582 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 23);Minneciv.Pollard,565\nU.S. 118(2012);Wilkiev.Robbins,551 U.S.\n537(2007);Correctional Services Corp.v.Malesko,534 U.S.\n61(2001);FDICv.Meyer,510\nU.S. 471(1994);Schweikerv.Chilicky,487 U.S.\n412(1988);United Statesv.Stanley,483 U.S.\n669(1987);Chappellv.Wallace,462 U.S.\n296(1983);Bushv.Lucas,462 U.S.\n367(1983).When asked to extendBivens, we engage in\na two-step inquiry. We first inquire whether the request involves a\nclaim that arises in a \u201cnew context\u201d or involves a \u201cnew category of\ndefendants.\u201dMalesko, 534 U.\u00a0S., at 68. And our\nunderstanding of a \u201cnew context\u201d is broad. We regard a context as\n\u201cnew\u201d if it is \u201cdifferent in a meaningful way from previousBivenscases decided by this Court.\u201dAbbasi, 582\nU.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 16).When we find that a claim arises in a new\ncontext, we proceed to the second step and ask whether there are\nany \u201c\u00a0\u2018\u00a0\u201cspecial factors [that] counse[l]\nhesitation\u201d\u00a0\u2019\u00a0\u201d about granting the extension.Id.,\nat ___ (slip op., at 12) (quotingCarlson, 446 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 18, in turn quotingBivens, 403 U.\u00a0S., at 396). If\nthere are\u2013\u2013that is, if we have reason to pause before applyingBivensin a new context or to a new class of defendants\u2014we\nreject the request.We have not attempted to \u201ccreate an exhaustive\nlist\u201d of factors that may provide a reason not to extendBivens, but we have explained that \u201ccentral to [this]\nanalysis\u201d are \u201cseparation-of-powers principles.\u201dAbbasi, 582\nU.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 12). We thus consider the risk of\ninterfering with the authority of the other branches, and we ask\nwhether \u201cthere are sound reasons to think Congress might doubt the\nefficacy or necessity of a damages remedy,\u201did.,at ___\n(slip op., at 13), and \u201cwhether the Judiciary is well suited,\nabsent congressional action or instruction, to consider and weigh\nthe costs and benefits of allowing a damages action to proceed,\u201did.,at ___ (slip op., at 12).IIIATheBivensclaims in this case assuredly\narise in a new context. Petitioners contend that their Fourth and\nFifth Amendment claims do not involve a new context becauseBivensandDavisinvolved claims under those same two\namendments, but that argument rests on a basic misunderstanding of\nwhat our cases mean by a new context. A claim may arise in a new\ncontext even if it is based on the same constitutional provision as\na claim in a case in which a damages remedy was previously\nrecognized. CompareCarlson, 446 U.\u00a0S., at 16\u201318\n(allowingBivensremedy for an Eighth Amendment claim for\nfailure to provide adequate medical treatment), withMalesko, 534 U.\u00a0S., at 71\u201374 (declining to create aBivensremedy in similar circumstances because the suit was\nagainst a private prison operator, not federal officials). And once\nwe look beyond the constitutional provisions invoked inBivens,Davis, and the present case, it is glaringly\nobvious that petitioners\u2019 claims involve a new context,i.e., one that is meaningfully different.Bivensconcerned an allegedly unconstitutional arrest and search carried\nout in New York City, 403 U.\u00a0S., at 389;Davisconcerned alleged sex discrimination on Capitol Hill, 442\nU.\u00a0S., at 230. There is a world of difference between those\nclaims and petitioners\u2019 cross-border shooting claims, where \u201cthe\nrisk of disruptive intrusion by the Judiciary into the functioning\nof other branches\u201d is significant.Abbasi, 582U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 16); see Parts\nIII\u2013B and III\u2013C,infra.Because petitioners assert claims that arise in\na new context, we must proceed to the next step and ask whether\nthere are factors that counsel hesitation. As we will explain,\nthere are multiple, related factors that raise warning flags.BThe first is the potential effect on foreign\nrelations. \u201cThe political branches, not the Judiciary, have the\nresponsibility and institutional capacity to weigh foreign-policy\nconcerns.\u201dJesner, 584 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 19).\nIndeed, we have said that \u201cmatters relating \u2018to the conduct of\nforeign relations .\u00a0.\u00a0. are so exclusively entrusted to\nthe political branches of government as to be largely immune from\njudicial inquiry or interference.\u2019\u00a0\u201dHaigv.Agee,453 U.S.\n280, 292 (1981) (quotingHarisiadesv.Shaughnessy,342 U.S.\n580, 589 (1952)). \u201cThus, unless Congress specifically has\nprovided otherwise, courts traditionally have been reluctant to\nintrude upon the authority of the Executive in [these matters].\u201dDepartment of Navyv.Egan,484\nU.S. 518, 530 (1988). We must therefore be especially wary\nbefore allowing aBivensremedy that impinges on this\narena.A cross-border shooting is by definition an\ninternational incident; it involves an event that occurs\nsimultaneously in two countries and affects both countries\u2019\ninterests. Such an incident may lead to a disagreement between\nthose countries, as happened in this case.The United States, through the Executive Branch,\nwhich has \u201c\u00a0\u2018the lead role in foreign policy,\u2019\u00a0\u201dMedell\u00ednv. Texas,552 U.S.\n491, 524 (2008) (alteration omitted), has taken the position\nthat this incident should be handled in a particular way\u2014namely,\nthat Agent Mesa should not face charges in the United States nor be\nextradited to stand trial in Mexico. As noted, the Executive\ndecided not to take action against Agent Mesa because it found that\nhe \u201cdid not act inconsistently with [Border Patrol] policy or\ntraining regarding use of force.\u201d DOJ Press Release. We presume\nthat Border Patrol policy and training incorporate both the\nExecutive\u2019s understanding of the Fourth Amendment\u2019s prohibition of\nunreasonable seizures and the Executive\u2019s assessment of\ncircumstances at the border. Thus, the Executive judged Agent\nMesa\u2019s conduct by what it regards as reasonable conduct by an agent\nunder the circumstances that Mesa faced at the time of the\nshooting, and based on the application of those standards, it\ndeclined to prosecute. The Executive does not want a Mexican\ncriminal court to judge Agent Mesa\u2019s conduct by whatever standards\nwould be applicable under Mexican law; nor does it want a jury in aBivensaction to apply its own understanding of what\nconstituted reasonable conduct by a Border Patrol agent under the\ncircumstances of this case. Such a jury determination, the\nExecutive claims, would risk the \u201c\u00a0\u2018\u00a0\u201cembarrassment of\nour government abroad\u201d through \u201cmultifarious pronouncements by\nvarious departments on one question.\u201d\u00a0\u2019\u00a0\u201d Brief for\nUnited States asAmicus Curiae18 (quotingSanchez-Espinozav. Reagan, 770 F.2d 202, 209 (CADC\n1985) (Scalia, J.)).The Government of Mexico has taken a different\nview of what should be done. It has requested that Agent Mesa be\nextradited for criminal prosecution in a Mexican court under\nMexican law, and it has supported petitioners\u2019Bivenssuit.\nIn a brief filed in this Court, Mexico suggests that shootings by\nBorder Patrol agents are a persistent problem and argues that the\nUnited States has an obligation under international law,\nspecifically Article 6(1) of the International Covenant on Civil\nand Political Rights, Dec. 19, 1966, S. Treaty Doc. No. 95\u201320, 999\nU.\u00a0N.\u00a0T.\u00a0S. 174, to provide a remedy for the\nshooting in this case. Brief for Government of United Mexican\nStates asAmicus Curiae2, 20\u201322. Mexico states that it \u201chas\na responsibility to look after the well-being of its nationals\u201d and\nthat \u201cit is a priority to Mexico to see that the United States\nprovides adequate means to hold the agents accountable and to\ncompensate the victims.\u201dId., at 3.Both the United States and Mexico have\nlegitimate and important interests that may be affected by the way\nin which this matter is handled. The United States has an interest\nin ensuring that agents assigned the difficult and important task\nof policing the border are held to standards and judged by\nprocedures that satisfy United States law and do not undermine the\nagents\u2019 effectiveness and morale. Mexico has an interest in\nexercising sovereignty over its territory and in protecting and\nobtaining justice for its nationals. It is not our task to\narbitrate between them.In the absence of judicial intervention, the\nUnited States and Mexico would attempt to reconcile their interests\nthrough diplomacy\u2013\u2013and that has occurred. The broad issue of\nviolence along the border, the occurrence of cross- border\nshootings, and this particular matter have been addressed through\ndiplomatic channels. In 2014, Mexico and the United States\nestablished a joint Border Violence Prevention Council, and the two\ncountries have addressed cross-border shootings through the United\nStates-Mexico bilateral Human Rights Dialogue.[2] Following the Justice Department investigation\nin the present case, the United States reaffirmed its commitment to\n\u201cwork with the Mexican government within existing mechanisms and\nagreements to prevent future incidents.\u201d DOJ Press Release.For these reasons, petitioners\u2019 assertion that\ntheir claims have \u201cnothing to do with the substance or conduct of\nU.\u00a0S. foreign .\u00a0.\u00a0. policy,\u201d Brief for Petitioners\n29, is plainly wrong.[3]CPetitioners are similarly incorrect in\ndeprecating the Fifth Circuit\u2019s conclusion that the issue here\nimplicates an element of national security.One of the ways in which the Executive protects\nthis country is by attempting to control the movement of people and\ngoods across the border, and that is a daunting task. The United\nStates\u2019 border with Mexico extends for 1,900 miles, and every day\nthousands of persons and a large volume of goods enter this country\nat ports of entry on the southern border.[4] The lawful passage of people and goods in both\ndirections across the border is beneficial to both countries.Unfortunately, there is also a large volume of\nillegalcross-border traffic. During the last fiscal\nyear, approximately 850,000 persons were apprehended attempting to\nenter the United States illegally from Mexico,[5] and large quantities of drugs were smuggled\nacross the border.[6] In\naddition, powerful criminal organizations operating on both sides\nof the border present a serious law enforcement problem for both\ncountries.[7]On the United States\u2019 side, the responsibility\nfor attempting to prevent the illegal entry of dangerous persons\nand goods rests primarily with the U.\u00a0S. Customs and Border\nProtection Agency, and one of its main responsibilities is to\n\u201cdetect, respond to, and interdict terrorists, drug smugglers and\ntraffickers, human smugglers and traffickers, and other persons who\nmay undermine the security of the United States.\u201d 6\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7211(c)(5). While Border Patrol agents often\nwork miles from the border, some, like Agent Mesa, are stationed\nright at the border and have the responsibility of attempting to\nprevent illegal entry. For these reasons, the conduct of agents\npositioned at the border has a clear and strong connection to\nnational security, as the Fifth Circuit understood. 885 F. 3d, at\n819.Petitioners protest that \u201c\u00a0\u2018shooting people\nwho are just walking down a street in Mexico\u2019\u00a0\u201d does not\ninvolve national security, Brief for Petitioners 28, but that\nmisses the point. The question is not whether national security\nrequires such conduct\u2013\u2013of course, it does not\u2013\u2013but whether the\nJudiciary should alter the framework established by the political\nbranches for addressing cases in which it is alleged that lethal\nforce was unlawfully employed by an agent at the border.

Since\nregulating the conduct of agents at the border unquestionably has\nnational security implications, the risk of undermining border\nsecurity provides reason to hesitate before extendingBivensinto this field.

(slip op., at 19). When foreign relations are implicated, it\n\u201cis even more important .\u00a0.\u00a0. \u2018to look for legislative\nguidance before exercising innovative authority over substantive\nlaw.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId.,at ___ (slip op., at 20) (quotingSosav.Alvarez-Machain,542\nU.S. 692, 726 (2004)). Accordingly, it is \u201ctelling,\u201dAbbasi, 582 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 20), that\nCongress has repeatedly declined to authorize the award of damages\nfor injury inflicted outside our borders.A leading example is 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a71983, which permits the recovery of damages for constitutional\nviolations by officers acting under color ofstatelaw. We\nhave describedBivensas a \u201cmore limited\u201d \u201cfederal analog\u201d\nto \u00a71983.Hartmanv.Moore,547\nU.S. 250, 254, n. 2 (2006). It is therefore instructive that\nCongress chose to make \u00a71983 available only to \u201ccitizen[s] of the\nUnited States or other person[s] within the jurisdiction thereof.\u201d\nIt would be \u201canomalous to impute .\u00a0.\u00a0. a judicially\nimplied cause of action beyond the bounds [Congress has] delineated\nfor [a] comparable express caus[e] of action.\u201dBlue Chip\nStampsv.Manor Drug Stores,421\nU.S. 723, 736 (1975). Thus, the limited scope of \u00a71983 weighs\nagainst recognition of theBivensclaim at issue here.Section 1983\u2019s express limitation to the claims\nbrought by citizens and persons subject to United States\njurisdiction is especially significant, but even if this explicit\nlimitation were lacking, we would presume that \u00a71983 did not apply\nabroad. SeeRJR Nabisco, Inc.v.European Community,\n579 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 7) (\u201cAbsent clearly\nexpressed congressional intent to the contrary, federal laws will\nbe construed to have only domestic application\u201d). We presume that\nstatutes do not apply extraterritorially to \u201censure that the\nJudiciary does not erroneously adopt an interpretation of\nU.\u00a0S. law that carries foreign policy consequences not clearly\nintended by the political branches.\u201dKiobelv.Royal\nDutch Petroleum Co.,569\nU.S. 108, 116 (2013); see alsoEEOCv. Arabian\nAmerican Oil Co.,499 U.S.\n244, 248 (1991).If this danger provides a reason for caution\nwhen Congress has enacted a statute but has not provided expressly\nwhether it applies abroad, we have even greater reason for\nhesitation in deciding whether to extend a judge-made cause of\naction beyond our borders. \u201c[T]he danger of unwarranted judicial\ninterference in the conduct of foreign policy is magnified\u201d where\n\u201cthe question is not what Congress has done but instead what courts\nmay do.\u201dKiobel, 569 U.\u00a0S., at 116. Where Congress has\nnot spoken at all, the likelihood of impinging on its foreign\naffairs authority is especially acute.Congress\u2019s treatment of ordinary tort claims\nagainst federal officers is also revealing. As petitioners and\ntheiramicistress, the traditional way in which civil\nlitigation addressed abusive conduct by federal officers was by\nsubjecting them to liability for common-law torts. See Brief for\nPetitioners 10\u201317. For many years, such claims could be raised in\nstate or federal court,[8] and\nthis Court occasionally considered tort suits against federal\nofficers for extraterritorial injuries. See,e.g.,Mitchellv.Harmony, 13 How. 115 (1852) (affirming\naward in trespass suit brought by U.\u00a0S. citizen against\nU.\u00a0S. Army officer who seized personal property in Mexico\nduring the Mexican-American war). AfterErie, federal\ncommon-law claims were out, but we recognized the continuing\nviability of state-law tort suits against federal officials as\nrecently asWestfallv.Erwin,484 U.S.\n292(1988).In response to that decision, Congress passed\nthe so-called Westfall Act, formally the Federal Employees\nLiability Reform and Tort Compensation Act of 1988, 28\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72679. That Act makes the Federal Tort Claims\nAct (FTCA) \u201cthe exclusive remedy for most claims against Government\nemployees arising out of their official conduct.\u201dHuiv.Castaneda,559 U.S.\n799, 806 (2010).[9] Thus, a\nperson injured by a federal employee may seek recovery directly\nfrom the United States under the FTCA, but the FTCA bars \u201c[a]ny\nclaim arising in a foreign country.\u201d \u00a72680(k).[10] The upshot is that claims that would\notherwise permit the recovery of damages are barred if the injury\noccurred abroad.Yet another example is provided by the Torture\nVictim Protection Act of 1991, note following 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a71350, which created a cause of action that may be brought by an\nalien in a U.\u00a0S. court under the Alien Tort Statute, \u00a71350.\nUnder the Torture Victim Protection Act, a damages action may be\nbrought by or on behalf of a victim of torture or an extrajudicial\nkilling carried out by a person who acted under the authority of a\nforeign state. Consequently, this provision, which is often\nemployed to seek redress for acts committed abroad,[11] cannot be used to sue a United States\nofficer. SeeMeshalv.Higgenbotham, 804 F.3d 417,\n430 (CADC 2015) (Kavanaugh, J., concurring).These statutes form a pattern that is important\nfor present purposes. When Congress has enacted statutes creating a\ndamages remedy for persons injured by United States Government\nofficers, it has taken care to preclude claims for injuries that\noccurred abroad.Instead, when Congress has provided compensation\nfor injuries suffered by aliens outside the United States, it has\ndone so by empowering Executive Branch officials to make payments\nunder circumstances found to be appropriate. Thus, the Foreign\nClaims Act, 10 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72734, first enacted during World\nWar II, ch. 645, 55Stat. 880, allows the Secretary of Defense to\nappoint claims commissions to settle and pay claims for personal\ninjury and property damage resulting from the noncombat activities\nof the Armed Forces outside this country. \u00a72734(a). Similarly,\n\u00a72734a allows the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of\nHomeland Security to make payments pursuant to \u201can international\nagreement which provides for the settlement or adjudication and\ncost sharing of claims against the United States\u201d that arise out of\n\u201cacts or omissions\u201d of the Armed Forces. \u00a72734a(a); see also 22\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72669(b) (State Department may settle and pay\ncertain claims for death, injury, or property loss or damage \u201cfor\nthe purpose of promoting and maintaining friendly relations with\nforeign countries\u201d); \u00a72669\u20131 (Secretary of State has authority to\npay tort claims arising in foreign countries in connection with\nState Department operations); 21 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7904 (Attorney\nGeneral has authority to pay tort claims arising in connection with\nthe operations of the Drug Enforcement Administration abroad).This pattern of congressional action\u2014refraining\nfrom authorizing damages actions for injury inflicted abroad by\nGovernment officers, while providing alternative avenues for\ncompensation in some situations\u2014gives us further reason to hesitate\nabout extendingBivensin this case.EIn sum, this case features multiple factors\nthat counsel hesitation about extendingBivens,but they can\nall be condensed to one concern\u2013\u2013respect for the separation of\npowers. SeeAbbasi, 582 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at\n12). \u201cForeign policy and national security decisions are \u2018delicate,\ncomplex, and involve large elements of prophecy\u2019 for which \u2018the\nJudiciary has neither aptitude, facilities[,] nor\nresponsibility.\u2019\u00a0\u201dJesner, 584 U.\u00a0S., at ___\n(Gorsuch, J., concurring part and concurring in judgment) (slip\nop., at 5) (quotingChicago & Southern Air Lines, Inc.v.Waterman S. S. Corp.,333 U.S.\n103, 111 (1948)). To avoid upsetting the delicate web of\ninternational relations, we typically presume that even\ncongressionally crafted causes of action do not apply outside our\nborders. These concerns are only heightened when judges are asked\nto fashion constitutional remedies. Congress, which has authority\nin the field of foreign affairs, has chosen not to create liability\nin similar statutes, leaving the resolution of extraterritorial\nclaims brought by foreign nationals to executive officials and the\ndiplomatic process.Congress\u2019s decision not to provide a judicial\nremedy does not compel us to step into its shoes. \u201cThe absence of\nstatutory relief for a constitutional violation .\u00a0.\u00a0.\ndoes not by any means necessarily imply that courts should award\nmoney damages against the officers responsible for the violation.\u201dSchweiker, 487 U.\u00a0S., at 421\u2013422; see alsoStanley, 483 U.\u00a0S., at 683 (\u201c[I]t is irrelevant to a\n\u2018special factors\u2019 analysis whether the laws currently on the books\nafford [plaintiff] an \u2018adequate\u2019 federal remedy for his\ninjuries\u201d).[12]When evaluating whether to extendBivens,the most important question \u201cis \u2018who should decide\u2019 whether to\nprovide for a damages remedy, Congress or the courts?\u201dAbbasi, 582 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 12) (quotingBush, 462 U.\u00a0S., at 380).

By enacting this provision,\nCongress made clear that it was not attempting to abrogateBivens, but the provi-sion certainly does not suggest, as\none of petitioners\u2019amicicontends, thatCongress \u201cintended\nfor a robust enforcement ofBivensremedies.\u201d Brief for\nInstitute for Justice asAmicus Curiae21. Instead, the\nprovision simply leftBivenswhere it found it. It is not a\nlicense to create a newBivensremedy in a context we have\nnever before addressed, seeCorrectional Services Corp.v.Malesko,534 U.S.\n61, 68 (2001).10Petitioners contend that Congress\nexcluded claims arising abroad in order to avoid subjecting the\nUnited States to liability under foreign law, something that cannot\noccur underBivens. Reply Brief 11. But neither the\nlegislative history recounted inSosav.Alvarez-Machain,542 U.S.\n692, 707 (2004), nor anything else offered by petitioners shows\nthat this was the only reason for this limitation. And the fact\nremains that the FTCA does not permit claims for torts committed\nabroad, a limitation that is consistent with Congress\u2019s general\npractice of avoiding extraterritorial legislation. See,e.g.,\nKiobelv.Royal Dutch Petroleum Co.,569 U.S.\n108, 115\u2013116 (2013).11See,e.g.,Samantarv.Yousuf,560 U.S.\n305, 308 (2010) (bringing claim under the Torture Victim\nProtection Act against the former First Vice President and Minister\nof Defense of Somalia for alleged torture and extrajudicial killing\nin Somalia).12Indeed, inAbbasiwe explained\nthat existence of alternative remedies was merely a further reason\nnot to createBivensliability. See 582 U.\u00a0S., at ___\n(slip op., at 22) (\u201c[W]hen alternative methods of relief are\navailable, aBivensremedy is usually not\u201d).",
