S. ____ (2009)SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESNO. 08-267UNITED STATES, PETITIONERv.JACOB\nDENEDOon writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the armed forces[June 8, 2009]Chief Justice Roberts, with whom\nJustice Scalia, Justice Thomas, and Justice Alito join, concurring\nin part and dissenting in part.The Court\u2019s approach is simple:\nJurisdiction to issue writs ofcoram nobisis a \u201cbelated\nextension\u201d of a court\u2019s original, statutory jurisdiction.Ante, at 8. The military courts here had original\njurisdiction over Denedo\u2019s case. Those courts therefore have\nimplicit \u201cextended\u201d jurisdiction to consider Denedo\u2019scoram\nnobispetition.The flaw in this syllogism is at the first\nstep: The only arguable authority for the proposition thatcoram nobisjurisdiction marches hand in hand with\noriginal jurisdiction is a footnote inUnited Statesv.Morgan,346\nU. S. 502(1954), and that case concerned Article III courts.\nThe military courts are markedly different. They are Article I\ncourts whose jurisdiction is precisely limited at every turn. Those\ncareful limits cannot be overridden by judicial \u201cextension\u201d of\nstatutory jurisdiction, or the addition of a \u201cfurther step\u201d to the\nones marked out by Congress.Ante, at 9 (internal\nquotation marks omitted).I agree with the majority that this Court has\njurisdiction to review the decision below, but respectfully dissent\nfrom its holding that military courts have jurisdiction to issue\nwrits ofcoram nobis.I\u201cTraditionally, military justice\nhas been a rough form of justice emphasizing summary procedures,\nspeedy convictions and stern penalties with a view to maintaining\nobedience and fighting fitness in the ranks.\u201dReidv.Covert,354\nU. S. 1, 35\u201336 (1957) (plurality opinion). Courts-martial are\ncomposed of active service members who sit only to hear the\nparticular case before them. Once a court-martial reaches a\njudgment and imposes a sentence, it is dissolved, and its members\nreturn to their regular duties.Prior to the Uniform Code of Military Justice\n(UCMJ), military courts of appeals did not exist. If a service\nmember wanted to challenge a court-martial conviction, he pursued a\ncollateral attack in an Article III court. There, review was\nlimited to whether the conviction was void \u201cbecause of lack of\njurisdiction or some other equally fundamental defect,\u201dSchlesingerv.Councilman,420 U. S. 738, 747 (1975); beyond\nthat, Article III courts adhered to \u201cthe general rule that the acts\nof a court martial, within the scope of its jurisdiction and duty,\ncannot be controlled or reviewed in the civil courts,\u201dSmithv.Whitney,116 U. S. 167, 177\n(1886).The UCMJ established a \u201ccomplete\nsystem of [military] review,\u201dBurnsv.Wilson,346 U. S. 137,\n140 (1953) (plurality opinion), including direct review in what are\nnow the Courts of Criminal Appeals (CCAs) and the Court of Appeals\nfor the Armed Forces (CAAF). But in keeping with the historical\nbackdrop against which these courts were created, Congress did not\ngrant military courts of appeals \u201cbroad responsibility with respect\nto administration of military justice\u201d; on the contrary, their\njurisdiction is \u201cnarrowly circumscribed\u201d by the governing statutes.Clintonv.Goldsmith,526 U. S. 529, 534, 535\n(1999) (internal quotation marks omitted).The CCAs provide direct, record-based review\nof court-martial judgments, but they may only review cases referred\nby the judge advocate general, who in turn refers only those cases\nin which specific sentences are imposed. 10 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a7866(b),\n(c). When reviewing that subset of court-martial judgments, a CCA\n\u201cmay act only with respect to the findings and sentence as approved\nby the convening authority.\u201d \u00a7866(c). If a case is reviewed by the\nCCA, the CCA\u2019s decision may then be reviewed by the CAAF. \u00a7867(a).\nBut that court, too, conducts limited direct review: It \u201cmay act\nonly with respect to the findings and sentence as approved by the\nconvening authority and as affirmed or set aside as incorrect in\nlaw by the [CCA].\u201d \u00a7867(c). Once direct review in the CCA and the\nCAAF is complete, and review in this Court is exhausted or waived,\na judgment as to the legality of the court-martial proceedings is\nfinal, and the sentence imposed may be executed. \u00a7871(c)(1).The UCMJ provides only one avenue for\nreconsideration of a final court-martial conviction: a petition for\na new trial under Article 73. See \u00a7873. An Article 73 petition may\nbe brought \u201cwithin two years after approval by the convening\nauthority of a court-martial sentence,\u201d meaning it may be brought\nbefore or after a conviction becomes final.Ibid.If\ndirect review is still pending before a CCA or the CAAF when the\npetition is filed, the judge advocate general (to whom the petition\nmust be directed) will refer the petition to that court.Ibid.But once the conviction is final, only the judge\nadvocate general may act on an Article 73 petition.Ibid.Article 76 \u201c\u00a0\u2018describ[es] the terminal\npoint for proceedings within the court-martial system.\u2019\u00a0\u201dCouncilman,supra, at 750 (quotingGusikv.Schilder,340 U. S. 128, 132\n(1950)). Under that provision, final court-martial judgments are\n\u201cbinding upon all departments, courts, agencies, and officers of\nthe United States,subject onlyto action upon a petition\nfor a new trial [under Article 73],\u201d or to action by the\nappropriate Secretary or the President. 10 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7876\n(emphasis added). Once an Article 73 petition is denied, a service\nmember has no relief left to seek within the court-martial system.\nSeeGusik,supra, at 133\u2013134.[Footnote 1]Federal courts are authorized to issue\nextraordinary writs such ascoram nobisonly as \u201cnecessary\nor appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions.\u201d 28 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a71651(a). The All Writs Act \u201cconfine[s] the power of the\nCAAF to issuing process \u2018in aid of\u2019 its existing statutory\njurisdiction\u201d and \u201cdoes not enlarge that jurisdiction.\u201dGoldsmith,supra, at 534\u2013535; see alsoNoydv.Bond,395 U. S. 683, 695,\nn.\u00a07 (1969) (although military courts can issue extraordinary\nwrits in aid of their direct review jurisdiction, \u201c[a] different\nquestion would, of course, arise in a case which the [courts are]\nnot authorized to review under the governing statutes\u201d). The UCMJ\ngrants military courts of appeals no jurisdiction over final\ncourt-martial judgments, so there is no jurisdiction for a\npostconviction extraordinary writ to \u201caid.\u201d A petition forcoram nobisby its nature seeks postconviction review; it\nis therefore beyond the scope of these courts\u2019 \u201cnarrowly\ncircumscribed\u201d statutory jurisdiction.Goldsmith,supra, at 535.IIThe majority overrides these\ncareful limits on military court jurisdiction by maintaining that\nlater jurisdiction to issuecoram nobisis a \u201cbelated\nextension\u201d of the statutory jurisdiction, that \u201cjurisdiction to\nissue [coram nobis] derives from the earlier\njurisdiction.\u201dAnte, at 8, 9. The authority the Court\ncites for this key jurisdictional analysis is\u2014a footnote. Seeante, at 8 (citingMorgan, 346 U. S., at 505,\nn.\u00a04);ante, at 9 (same). Now, footnotes are part of\nan opinion, too, even if not the most likely place to look for a\nkey jurisdictional ruling. But since footnote 4 plays such an\nindispensable role in the majority\u2019s analysis, it must be read with\ncare.The first thing you notice in\ndoing so is that the footnote does not mention the word\n\u201cjurisdiction\u201d at all. That is because it has nothing to do with\njurisdiction. The issue addressed in the paragraph to which the\nfootnote was appended was \u201cchoice of remedy.\u201d 346 U. S., at 505.\nThe Court concluded thatcoram nobiswas the appropriate\none. The footnote simply addressed the concern that the remedy\nmight not be available because the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure\nhad abolishedcoram nobisas a remedy; the concern was\ndismissed because the Court concluded the criminal rules, not the\ncivil rules, applied.Id., at 505, n.\u00a04; see alsoUnited Statesv.Keogh, 391 F.\u00a02d 138, 140\n(CA2 1968) (Friendly, J.) (\u201cThe problem to which the footnote was\naddressed was that F. R. Civ. P. 60(b) had abolished writs of errorcoram nobis\u201d).The point is further confirmed by the text in\nthe body of the opinion: The Court\u2019s conclusion in the paragraph in\nwhich the footnote appears is that since the remedy sought was \u201cin\nthe nature of \u2026coram nobis,\u201d the trial court could\n\u201cproperlyexerciseits jurisdiction.\u201d 346 U. S., at 505\n(emphasis added). The issue was not the existence of jurisdiction,\nbut whether the court had the authority to exercise it. The Court\nin the present case recognizes the distinction. Seeante,\nat 10 (\u201cWhen exercising its jurisdiction, the CAAF\u2019s authority is\nconfined to matters of law\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted));ante, at 9 (\u201cThe authority to issue a writ under the All\nWrits Act is not a font of jurisdiction\u201d).Even accepting the majority\u2019s reading ofMorgan\u2019s hitherto obscure footnote, that reading would\nonly establish the \u201cbelated jurisdiction\u201d theory for Article III\ncourts. The military courts are Article I courts. The distinction\nhas direct pertinence to the point at issue in this case.Legal doctrines \u201cmust be placed in their\nhistorical setting. They cannot be wrenched from it and\nmechanically transplanted into an alien, unrelated context without\nsuffering mutilation or distortion.\u201dReid, 354 U. S., at\n50 (Frankfurter, J., concurring in result). The Article III courts\nhave been given broad jurisdiction. I can understand, if not\nnecessarily agree with, the notion that they might enjoy some\nimplicit \u201clong-recognized authority\u201d to correct their earlier\njudgments. Seeante, at 11. But not so for Article I\ncourts. The principle that Congress defines the jurisdiction of the\nlower federal courts \u201capplies with added force to Article I\ntribunals.\u201dAnte, at 7. That is especially true with\nrespect to military courts. The military justice system is the last\nplace courts should go about finding \u201cextensions\u201d of jurisdiction\nbeyond that conferred by statute.As we expressly recognized inGoldsmith, \u201cthere is no source ofcontinuingjurisdiction for the CAAF over all actions administering sentences\nthat the CAAFat one timehad the power to review.\u201d 526 U.\nS., at 536 (emphasis added). Since the UCMJ grants military courts\nno postconviction jurisdiction, conferring on them perpetual\nauthority to entertaincoram nobispetitions plainly\ncontravenes that basic principle.[Footnote 2]IIIEven if the majority\u2019s reading ofMorgan\u2019s footnote could be transplanted to the military\ncontext, the majority\u2019s conclusion would still not follow.\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018[T]he All Writs Act is a residual source of authority to\nissue writs that are not otherwise covered by statute. Where a\nstatute specifically addresses the particular issue at hand, it is\nthat authority, and not the All Writs Act, that is\ncontrolling.\u2019\u00a0\u201dCarlislev.United States,517 U. S. 416,\n429 (1996) (quotingPennsylvania Bureau of Correctionv.United States Marshals Service,474 U. S. 34, 43\n(1985)).The UCMJ contains not one, but\ntwo provisions specifically limiting the circumstances under which\npostconviction relief (other than action by the appropriate\nSecretary or the President) may be obtained within the\ncourt-martial system. First, Article 73 provides that, \u201cwithin two\nyears after approval by the convening authority of a court-martial\nsentence, the accused may petition the Judge Advocate General for a\nnew trial on the grounds of newly discovered evidence or fraud on\nthe court.\u201d 10 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7873. The only relief available under\nthis \u201cspecial post-conviction remedy\u201d is a new trial,Burns, 346 U. S., at 141 (plurality opinion), and even\nthat may be granted only in an expressly circumscribed timeframe\n(two years) and set of circumstances (newly discovered evidence or\nfraud on the court). Article 73 stands in stark contrast tocoram nobis, which the majority characterizes as a writ\ninfinitely available \u201cto redress a[ny] fundamental error.\u201dAnte, at 6; seeMorgan,supra, at 512\n(\u201cfundamental error\u201d not limited to jurisdictional defects or\nerrors on the face of the record).To be sure, the limited nature of relief\navailable under Article 73 might lead one to question whether that\nis truly theonlypostconviction relief the UCMJ permits.\n\u201cYou\u2019re in the Army now\u201d is a sufficient answer to such concerns;\nthe relief available looks positively extravagant in light of the\nprior history and tradition of military justice. In any event, as\nthe majority recognizes, seeante, at 11, Article 76 makes\nclear that all court-martial judgments \u201ccarried into execution\u201d\nafter completion of direct review are \u201cfinal and conclusive,\u201d 10 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a7876. Contrary to the majority\u2019s assertion, that\nlanguage does not simply \u201ccodif[y] the common-law rule that\nrespects the finality of judgments.\u201dAnte, at 11. In fact,\nArticle 76 does not stop there. It goes on to instruct that final\ncourt-martial judgments are binding \u201csubject onlyto\naction upon a petition for a new trial [under Article 73],\u201d or\naction by the appropriate Secretary or the President. 10 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a7876 (emphasis added).In light of these provisions, only Article 73\nprovidesanyauthority to the CCAs or the CAAF, and even\nthat narrow authority is limited to pending cases. Once a\nconviction is final, only the judge advocate general can provide\nrelief. Seesupra, at 3; 10 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7873. To the\nextent the CCAs or the CAAF could be deemed to have some inherent\ncontinuing authority to issue writs ofcoram nobis,\nArticles 73 and 76 extinguish it.IVThe Government goes on to argue\nthat even if military courts have jurisdiction to issue writs ofcoram nobis, and even if Articles 73 and 76 do not bar\nsuch relief, the courts still lack authority to issuecoram\nnobis, because the writ is neither \u201cnecessary\u201d nor\n\u201cappropriate\u201d to the court-martial system of justice. See 28 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a71651(a) (federal courts \u201cmay issue all writs necessary\nor appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions\u201d).Coram nobisallows the court that issued a judgment to\ncorrect its own errors of fact. SeeMorgan, 346 U. S., at\n507, n.\u00a09 (\u201c\u00a0\u2018If a judgment in the King\u2019s Bench be\nerroneous in matter offactonly, \u2026 it may be reversedin the same court, by writ of errorcoram\nnobis\u2019\u00a0\u201d (quoting 2 W. Tidd, Practice of the Courts of\nKing\u2019s Bench, and Common Pleas 1136 (4th Am. ed. 1856); some\nemphasis added)); see alsoante, at 11 (referring to\n\u201cauthority of a court to protect the integrity ofitsearlier judgments\u201d (emphasis added)). But a court-martial is not a\nstanding court. On a case-by-case basis, \u201c[i]t is called into\nexistence for a special purpose and to perform a particular duty.\nWhen the object of its creation has been accomplished it is\ndissolved.\u201dRunklev.United States,122 U. S. 543, 555\u2013556\n(1887); see also 66 M.\u00a0J. 114, 124 (CAAF 2008) (a\ncourt-martial \u201cdoes not have independent jurisdiction over a case\nafter the military judge authenticates the record and the convening\nauthority forwards the record after taking action\u201d). Because the\ncourt-martial that issues the conviction no longer exists once the\nconviction is final, there is no court to which a postconviction\npetition forcoram nobiscould be directed.The absence of standing\ncourts-martial is no mere technicality, but rather an integral and\nintentional part of the military justice system. \u201cCourt-martial\njurisdiction sprang from the belief that within the military ranks\nthere is need for a prompt, ready-at-hand means of compelling\nobedience and order.\u201dUnited States ex rel. Tothv.Quarles,350 U. S. 11, 22 (1955). But meeting\nthat need requires expending significant military resources, and\n\u201c[t]o the extent that those responsible for performance of [the\nmilitary\u2019s] primary function are diverted from it by the necessity\nof trying cases, the basic fighting purpose of armies is not\nserved.\u201dId., at 17. Accordingly, courts-martial, composed\nof active duty military personnel, have always been called into\nexistence for a limited purpose and duration.It is no answer that the CCAs and the CAAF are\nstanding courts that could act as substitutes forcoram\nnobispurposes. As this case illustrates, those courts are not\nequipped to handle the kind of factfinding necessary to resolve\nclaims that might be brought oncoram nobis. Instead, the\nCCAs will have to resort to the procedures invented byUnited\nStatesv.DuBay, 17 U. S.\u00a0C.\u00a0M.\u00a0A.\n147, 37 C.\u00a0M.\u00a0R. 411 (1967), under which a new convening\nauthority will refer a case to a new court-martial, and task\nvarious military personnel who have no prior familiarity with the\ncase to conduct an out-of-court evidentiary hearing on the merits\nof the petitioner\u2019s claim.Id., at 149, 37\nC.\u00a0M.\u00a0R., at 413. This \u201cunwieldy and imperfect system\u201d\nwill undoubtedly divert valuable military resources, 66 M.\u00a0J.,\nat 136 (Ryan, J., dissenting), all in aid of postconviction relief\nCongress specifically withheld.The Court expressly declines to consider the\nGovernment\u2019s \u201cnecessary or appropriate\u201d argument: \u201c[T]he\nGovernment\u2019s argument speaks to the scope of the writ, not the\n[CCA\u2019s] jurisdiction to issue it. The CAAF rejected the former\nargument. Only the latter one is before us.\u201dAnte, at 12.\nThe Court may well be correct in dividing the questions into\nseparate pigeonholes. But the Government\u2019s argument, even if an\nargument about authority rather than jurisdiction, applies toevery coram nobiscase, given the nature of the military\njustice system. It is curious to conclude that military courts have\njurisdiction, while not considering a raised and briefed argument\nthat they may never exercise it.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*Since the adoption of the UCMJ,\n\u201cCongress has gradually changed the system of military justice so\nthat it has come to more closely resemble the civilian system.\u201dWeissv.United States,510 U. S. 163, 174\n(1994). \u201cBut the military in important respects remains a\nspecialized society separate from civilian society.\u201dIbid.(internal quotation marks omitted). Neither the jurisdiction nor\nthe powers of Article III courts are necessarily appropriate for\nmilitary courts, and Congress\u2019s contrary determinations in this\narea are entitled to \u201cthe highest deference.\u201dLovingv.United States,517 U. S. 748, 768\n(1996). Rather than respect the rule that military courts have no\njurisdiction to revisit final convictions, the majority creates an\nexception that swallows it. Because I would hold the military\ncourts to the statutory restraints that govern them, I respectfully\ndissent.Footnote 1A court-martial conviction may still be\ncollaterally attacked in an Article III court, but that is becausethosecourts possess jurisdiction beyond that granted by\nthe UCMJ. See,e.g., 28 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a72241, 1331. We\nhave repeatedly held that Article 76 \u201cdoes not expressly effect any\nchange in the subject-matter jurisdiction of Art.\u00a0III courts.\u201dSchlesingerv.Councilman,420 U. S. 738, 749 (1975). Our cases\nhave never questioned that Article 76 limits the jurisdiction ofmilitarycourts.Footnote 2Once you get into the business of extending\njurisdiction, it can be hard to stop. Denedo is no longer in the\nmilitary.Ante, at 2. Military courts lack jurisdiction\nover \u201ccivilian ex-soldiers who ha[ve] severed all relationship with\nthe military and its institutions.\u201dUnited States ex rel.\nTothv.Quarles,350 U. S. 11, 14 (1955). In the eventcoram nobisdoes issue with respect to a former service\nmember, the Government maintains it would lack jurisdiction to\nretry. Tr. of Oral Arg. 56\u201357; see 10 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a7802\u2013803.\nAvoiding that extraordinary result would require another \u201cbelated\nextension\u201d of the original court-martial proceeding, expanding the\njurisdiction of military courts to try individuals who have long\nsince severed their ties to the military.",
