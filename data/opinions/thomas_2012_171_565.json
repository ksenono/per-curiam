I write separately\nto note that, in my view, the Religion Clauses require civil courts\nto apply the ministerial exception and to defer to a religious\norganization\u2019s good-faith understanding of who qualifies as its\nminister. As the Court explains, the Religion Clauses guarantee\nreligious organizations autonomy in matters of internal governance,\nincluding the selection of those who will minister the faith. A\nreligious organi-zation\u2019s right to choose its ministers would be\nhollow, however, if secular courts could second-guess the\norganiza-tion\u2019s sincere determination that a given employee is a\n\u201cminister\u201d under the organization\u2019s theological tenets. Our\ncountry\u2019s religious landscape includes organizations with different\nleadership structures and doctrines that influence their\nconceptions of ministerial status. The question whether an employee\nis a minister is itself religious in nature, and the answer will\nvary widely. Judicial attempts to fashion a civil definition of\n\u201cminister\u201d through a bright-line test or multi-factor analysis risk\ndisadvantaging those religious groups whose beliefs, practices, and\nmembership are outside of the \u201cmainstream\u201d or unpalatable to some.\nMoreover, uncertainty about whether its ministerial designation\nwill be rejected, and a corresponding fear of liability, may cause\na religious group to conform its beliefs and practices regarding\n\u201cministers\u201d to the prevailing secular understanding. SeeCorporation of Presiding Bishop of Church of Jesus Christ of\nLatter-day Saintsv.Amos,483 U.S.\n327, 336 (1987) (\u201c[I]t is a significant burden on a religious\norganization to require it, on pain of substantial liability, to\npredict which of its activities a secular court will consider\nreligious. The line is hardly a bright one, and an organization\nmight understandably be concerned that a judge would not understand\nits religious tenets and sense of mission. Fear of potential\nliability might affect the way an organization carried out what it\nunderstood to be its religious mission\u201d (footnote omitted)). These\nare certainly dangers that the First Amendment was designed to\nguard against.The Court thoroughly sets forth the facts that\nlead to its conclusion that Cheryl Perich was one of\nHosanna-Tabor\u2019s ministers, and I agree that these facts amply\ndemonstrate Perich\u2019s ministerial role. But the evidence\ndemonstrates that Hosanna-Tabor sincerely considered Perich a\nminister. That would be sufficient for me to conclude that\nPer-ich\u2019s suit is properly barred by the ministerial exception.",
