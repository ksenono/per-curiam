Courts defer to an agency\u2019s interpretation of law when\nand because Congress has conferred on the agency interpretive\nauthority over the question at issue. An agency cannot exercise\ninterpretive authority until it has it; the question whether an\nagency enjoys that authority must be decided by a court, without\ndeference to the agency.IOne of the principal authors of the\nConstitution famously wrote that the \u201caccumulation of all powers,\nlegislative, executive, and judiciary, in the same hands,\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. may justly be pronounced the very definition of\ntyranny.\u201d The Federalist No. 47, p.\u00a0324 (J. Cooke ed. 1961)\n(J. Madison). Although modern administrative agencies fit most\ncomfortably within the Executive Branch, as a practical matter they\nexercise legislative power, by promulgating regulations with the\nforce of law; executive power, by policing compliance with those\nregulations; and judicial power, by adjudicating enforcement\nactions and imposing sanctions on those found to have violated\ntheir rules. The accumulation of these powers in the same hands is\nnot an occasional or isolated exception to the constitutional plan;\nit is a central feature of modern American government.The administrative state \u201cwields vast power and\ntouches almost every aspect of daily life.\u201dFree Enterprise\nFundv.Public Company Accounting Oversight Bd., 561\nU.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 18). The Framers could\nhardly have envisioned today\u2019s \u201cvast and varied federal\nbureaucracy\u201d and the authority administrative agencies now hold\nover our economic, social, and political activities.Ibid.\u201c[T]he administrative state with its reams of regulations would\nleave them rubbing their eyes.\u201dAldenv.Maine,527 U.S.\n706, 807 (1999) (Souter, J., dissenting), quoted inFederal\nMaritime Comm\u2019nv.South Carolina Ports Authority,535 U.S.\n743, 755 (2002). And the federal bureaucracy continues to grow;\nin the last 15 years, Congress has launched more than 50 new\nagencies. Compare Office of the Federal Register, United States\nGovernment Manual 1997/1998, with Office of the Federal Register,\nUnited States Government Manual 2012. And more are on the way. See,e.g.,Congressional Research Service, C. Copeland, New\nEntities Created Pursuant to the Patient Protection and Affordable\nCare Act 1 (2010) (The PPACA \u201ccreates, requires others to create,\nor authorizes dozens of new entities to implement the\nlegislation\u201d).Although the Constitution empowers the President\nto keep federal officers accountable, administrative agencies enjoy\nin practice a significant degree of independence. As scholars have\nnoted, \u201cno President (or his executive office staff) could, and\npresumably none would wish to, supervise so broad a swath of\nregulatory activity.\u201d Kagan, Presidential Administration, 114 Harv.\nL.\u00a0Rev. 2245, 2250 (2001); see also S. Breyer, Making Our\nDemocracy Work 110 (2010) (\u201cthe president may not have the time or\nwillingness to review [agency] decisions\u201d). President Truman\ncolorfully described his power over the administrative state by\ncomplaining, \u201cI thought I was the president, but when it comes to\nthese bureaucrats, I can\u2019t do a damn thing.\u201d See R. Nathan, The\nAdministrative Presidency 2 (1986). President Kennedy once told a\nconstituent, \u201cI agree with you, but I don\u2019t know if the government\nwill.\u201d Seeid.,at 1. The collection of agencies housed\noutside the traditional executive departments, including the\nFederal Communications Commission, is routinely described as the\n\u201cheadless fourth branch of government,\u201d reflecting not only the\nscope of their authority but their practical independence. See,e.g.,Administrative Conference of United States, D. Lewis\n& J. Selin, Sourcebook of United States Executive Agencies 11\n(2012).As for judicial oversight, agencies enjoy broad\npower to construe statutory provisions over which they have been\ngiven interpretive authority. InChevron U.\u00a0S.\u00a0A.\nInc.v.Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., we\nestablished a test for reviewing \u201can agency\u2019s construction of the\nstatute which it administers.\u201d467 U.S.\n837, 842 (1984). If Congress has \u201cdirectly spoken to the\nprecise question at issue,\u201d we said, \u201cthat is the end of the\nmatter.\u201dIbid.A contrary agency interpretation must give\nway. But if Congress has not expressed a specific intent, a court\nis bound to defer to any \u201cpermissible construction of the statute,\u201d\neven if that is not \u201cthe reading the court would have reached if\nthe question initially had arisen in a judicial proceeding.\u201dId.,at 843, and n.\u00a011.When it applies,Chevronis a powerful\nweapon in an agency\u2019s regulatory arsenal. Congressional delegations\nto agencies are often ambiguous\u2014expressing \u201ca mood rather than a\nmessage.\u201d Friendly, The Federal Administrative Agencies: The Need\nfor Better Definition of Standards, 75 Harv. L.\u00a0Rev. 1263,\n1311 (1962). By design or default, Congress often fails to speak to\n\u201cthe precise question\u201d before an agency. In the absence of such an\nanswer, an agency\u2019s interpretation has the full force and effect of\nlaw, unless it \u201cexceeds the bounds of the permissible.\u201dBarnhartv.Walton,535 U.S.\n212, 218 (2002).It would be a bit much to describe the result as\n\u201cthe very definition of tyranny,\u201d but the danger posed by the\ngrowing power of the administrative state cannot be dismissed. See,e.g.,Talk America, Inc.v.Michigan Bell\nTelephone Co., 564 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2011) (Scalia, J.,\nconcurring) (slip op., at 3) (noting that the FCC \u201chas repeatedly\nbeen rebuked in its attempts to expand the statute beyond its text,\nand has repeatedly sought new means to the same ends\u201d);Sackettv.EPA, 566 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___\u2013___ (2012)\n(slip op., at 9\u201310) (rejecting agency argument that would \u201cenable\nthe strong-arming of regulated parties into \u2018voluntary compliance\u2019\nwithout the opportunity for judicial review\u201d).What the Court says in footnote 4 of its opinion\nis good, and true (except of course for the \u201cdissent overstates\u201d\npart).Ante,at 13\u201314, n.\u00a04. The Framers did divide\ngovernmental power in the manner the Court describes, for the\npurpose of safeguarding liberty. And yet .\u00a0.\u00a0. the\ncitizen confronting thousands of pages of regulations\u2014promulgated\nby an agency directed by Congress to regulate, say, \u201cin the public\ninterest\u201d\u2014can perhaps be excused for thinking that it is the agency\nreally doing the legislating. And with hundreds of federal agencies\npoking into every nook and cranny of daily life, that citizen might\nalso understandably question whether Presidential oversight\u2014a\ncritical part of the Constitutional plan\u2014is always an effective\nsafeguard against agency overreaching.It is against this background that we consider\nwhether the authority of administrative agencies should be\naugmented even further, to include not only broad power to give\ndefinitive answers to questions left to them by Congress, but also\nthe same power to decide when Congress has given them that\npower.Before proceeding to answer that question,\nhowever, it is necessary to sort through some confusion over what\nthis litigation is about. The source of the confusion is a familiar\nculprit: the concept of \u201cjurisdiction,\u201d which we have repeatedly\ndescribed as a word with \u201c\u00a0\u2018many, too many, meanings.\u2019\u00a0\u201dUnion Pacific R.\u00a0Co.v.Locomotive Engineers,558 U.S.\n67, 81 (2009).The Court states that the question \u201cis whether a\ncourt must defer underChevronto an agency\u2019s interpretation\nof a statutory ambiguity that concerns the scope of the agency\u2019s\nstatutory authority (that is, its jurisdiction).\u201dAnte,at\n5. That is fine\u2014until the parenthetical. The parties,amici,\nand court below too often use the term \u201cjurisdiction\u201d imprecisely,\nwhich leads the Court to misunderstand the argument it must\nconfront. That argument is not that \u201cthere exist two distinct\nclasses of agency interpretations,\u201d some \u201cbig, important ones\u201d that\n\u201cdefine the agency\u2019s \u2018jurisdiction,\u2019\u00a0\u201d and other \u201chumdrum,\nrun-of-the-mill\u201d ones that \u201care simply applications of jurisdiction\nthe agency plainly has.\u201dIbid.The argument is instead that\na court should not defer to an agency on whether Congress has\ngranted the agency interpretive authority over the statutory\nambiguity at issue.You can call that \u201cjurisdiction\u201d if you\u2019d like,\nas petitioners do in the question presented. But given that the\nterm is ambiguous, more is required to understand its use in that\nquestion than simply \u201chaving read it.\u201dAnte,at 15,\nn.\u00a05. It is important to keep in mind that the term, in the\npresent context, has the more precise meaning noted above,\nencompassing congressionally delegated authority to issue\ninterpretations with the force and effect of law. See 668 F.3d 229,\n248 (CA5 2012) (case below) (\u201cThe issue in the instant case is\nwhether the FCC possessed statutory authority to administer\n\u00a7332(c)(7)(B)(ii) and (v) by adopting the 90- and 150-day time\nframes\u201d). And that has nothing do with whether the statutory\nprovisions at issue are \u201cbig\u201d or \u201csmall.\u201dII\u201cIt is emphatically the province and duty of\nthe judicial department to say what the law is.\u201dMarburyv.Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 177 (1803). The rise of the modern\nadministrative state has not changed that duty. Indeed, the\nAdministrative Procedure Act, governing judicial review of most\nagency action, instructs reviewing courts to decide \u201call relevant\nquestions of law.\u201d 5 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7706.We do not ignore that command when we afford an\nagency\u2019s statutory interpretationChevrondeference; we\nrespect it. We give binding deference to permissible agency\ninterpretations of statutory ambiguitiesbecauseCon- gress\nhas delegated to the agency the authority to interpret those\nambiguities \u201cwith the force of law.\u201dUnited Statesv.Mead Corp.,533 U.S.\n218, 229 (2001); see also Monaghan,Marburyand the\nAdministrative State, 83 Colum. L.\u00a0Rev. 1, 27\u201328 (1983) (\u201cthe\ncourt is not abdicating its constitutional duty to \u2018say what the\nlaw is\u2019 by deferring to agency interpretations of law: it is simply\napplying the law as \u2018made\u2019 by the authorized law-making\nentity\u201d).But before a court may grant such deference, it\nmust on its own decide whether Congress\u2014the branch vested with\nlawmaking authority under the Constitution\u2014has in fact delegated to\nthe agency lawmaking power over the ambiguity at issue. Seeante,at 4 (Breyer, J., concurring in part and concurring in\njudgment) (\u201cThe question whether Congress has delegated to an\nagency the authority to provide an interpretation that carries the\nforce of law is for the judge to answer independently.\u201d). Agencies\nare creatures of Congress; \u201can agency literally has no power to act\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. unless and until Congress confers power upon it.\u201dLouisiana Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019nv.FCC,476 U.S.\n355, 374 (1986). Whether Congress has conferred such power is\nthe \u201crelevant question[ ] of law\u201d that must be answered before\naffordingChevrondeference. 5 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7706.IIIAOur precedents confirm this\nconclusion\u2014beginning withChevronitself. InChevron,\nthe EPA promulgated a regulation interpreting the term \u201cstationary\nsources\u201d in the Clean Air Act. 467 U.\u00a0S., at 840 (quoting 42\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a77502(b)(6)(1982 ed.)). An environmental group\npetitioned for review of the rule, challenging it as an\nimpermissible interpretation of the Act. 467 U.\u00a0S., at 841,\n859. Finding the statutory text \u201cnot dispositive\u201d and the\nlegislative history \u201csilent on the precise issue,\u201d we upheld the\nrule.Id.,at 862, 866.In our view, the challenge to the agency\u2019s\ninterpretation \u201ccenter[ed] on the wisdom of the agency\u2019s policy,\nrather than whether it is a reasonable choice within a gap left\nopen by Congress.\u201dId.,at 866. Judges, we said, \u201care not\nexperts in the field, and are not part of either political branch\nof the Government.\u201dId.,at 865. Thus, because Congress had\nnot answered the specific question at issue, judges had no business\nproviding their own resolution on the basis of their \u201cpersonal\npolicy preferences.\u201dIbid.Instead, the \u201cagency to which\nCongress ha[d] delegated policymaking responsibilities\u201d was the\nappropriate political actor to resolve the competing interests at\nstake, \u201cwithin the limits of that delegation.\u201dIbid.Chevron\u2019s rule of deference was based\non\u2014and limited by\u2014this congressional delegation. And the Court did\nnot ask simply whether Congress had delegated to the EPA the\nauthority to administer the Clean Air Act generally. We asked\nwhether Congress had \u201cdelegat[ed] authority to the agency to\nelucidate aspecific provisionof the statute by\nregulation.\u201dId.,at 843\u2013844 (emphasis added); seeid., at 844 (discussing \u201cthe legislative delegation to an\nagency on aparticular question\u201d (emphasis added)). We\ndeferred to the EPA\u2019s interpretation of \u201cstationary sources\u201d based\non our conclusion that the agency had been \u201ccharged with\nresponsibility for administeringthe provision.\u201dId.,at 865 (emphasis added).BWe have never faltered in our understanding of\nthis straightforward principle, that whether a particular agency\ninterpretation warrantsChevrondeference turns on the\ncourt\u2019s determination whether Congress has delegated to the agency\nthe authority to interpret the statutory ambiguity at issue.We made the point perhaps most clearly inAdams Fruit Co.v.Barrett,494\nU.S. 638(1990). In that case, the Department of Labor\ncontended the Court should defer to its interpretation of the scope\nof the private right of action provided by the Migrant and Seasonal\nAgriculture Worker Protection Act (AWPA), 29 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a71854, against employers who intentionally violated the Act\u2019s motor\nvehicle safety provisions. We refused to do so. Although \u201cas an\ninitial matter\u201d we rejected the idea that Congress left a\n\u201cstatutory \u2018gap\u2019\u00a0\u201d for the agency to fill, we reasoned that if\nthe \u201cAWPA\u2019s language establishing a private right of action is\nambiguous,\u201d the Secretary of Labor\u2019s interpretation of its scope\ndid not warrantChevrondeference. 494 U.\u00a0S., at\n649.In language directly applicable to the question\nbefore us, we explained that \u201c[a] precondition to deference underChevronis a congressional delegation of administrative\nauthority.\u201dIbid.Although \u201cCongress clearly envisioned,\nindeed expressly mandated, a role for the Department of Labor in\nadministering the statute by requiring the Secretary to promulgatestandardsimplementing AWPA\u2019smotor vehicle\nprovisions,\u201d we found \u201c[n]o such delegation regarding AWPA\u2019senforcement provisions.\u201dId.,at 650 (emphasis\nadded). It would therefore be \u201cinappropriate,\u201d we said, \u201cto consult\nexecutive interpretations\u201d of the enforcement provisions to resolve\nambiguities \u201csurrounding the scope of AWPA\u2019s judicially enforceable\nremedy.\u201dIbid.Without questioning the principle that agency\ndeterminations \u201cwithin the scope of delegated authority are\nentitled to deference,\u201d we explained that \u201cit is fundamental \u2018that\nan agency may not bootstrap itself into an area in which it has no\njurisdiction.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIbid.(quotingFederal Maritime\nComm\u2019nv.Seatrain Lines, Inc.,411\nU.S. 726, 745 (1973)).Our subsequent cases follow the same approach.\nInUnited Statesv.Mead Corp.,supra, for\nexample,Chevrondeference turned on whether Congress had\ndelegated to the agency authority to interpret the statutory\nambiguity by a particular means. The Customs Service had issued a\n\u201cclassification ruling,\u201d interpreting the term \u201cdiaries\u201d in a\ntariff schedule to include \u201cday planners\u201d of the type Mead\nimported, and on that basis subjected the planners to a\nfour-percent tariff. Mead protested the imposition of the tariff,\nthe Customs Service claimedChevrondeference for its\ninterpretation, and the controversy made its way to our Court.Id.,at 224\u2013226.InMead, we again made clear that the\n\u201ccategory of interpretative choices\u201d to whichChevrondeference applies is defined by congressional intent.Id.,at 229.Chevrondeference, we said, rests on a recognition\nthat Congress has delegated to an agency the interpretive authority\nto implement \u201ca particular provision\u201d or answer \u201c\u00a0\u2018a\nparticular question.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIbid.(quotingChevron,\n467 U.\u00a0S., at 844).An agency\u2019s interpretation of \u201ca\nparticular statutory provision\u201d thus qualifies forChevrondeference only \u201cwhen it appears that Congress delegated authority\nto the agency generally to make rules carrying the force of law,\nand that the agency interpretation claiming deference was\npro-mulgated in the exercise of that authority.\u201d 533 U.\u00a0S., at\n226\u2013227.The Court did not defer to the agency\u2019s views\nbut instead determined that Congress had not delegated interpretive\nauthority to the Customs Service to definitively construe the\ntariff schedule through classification rulings. Neither the\nstatutory authorization for the classification rulings, nor the\nCustoms Service\u2019s practice in issuing such rulings, \u201creasonably\nsuggest[ed] that Congress ever thought of [such] classification\nrulings as deserving the deference claimed for them.\u201dId.,at 231. And in the absence of such a delegation, we concluded the\ninterpretations adopted in those rulings were \u201cbeyond theChevronpale.\u201dId.,at 234.Gonzalesv.Oregon,546 U.S.\n243(2006), is in the same line of precedent. In that case, as\nhere, deference turned on whether a congressional delegation of\ninterpretive authority reached a particular statutory ambiguity.\nThe Attorney General claimedChevrondeference for his\ninterpretation of the phrase \u201clegitimate medical purpose\u201d in the\nControlled Substances Act (CSA) to exclude the prescribing and\ndispensing of controlled substances for the purpose of assisting\nsuicide.Id.,at 254, 258. No one disputed that \u201clegitimate\nmedical purpose\u201d was \u201cambiguous in the relevant sense.\u201dId.,at 258. Nor did any Justice dispute that the Attorney General had\nbeen granted the power in the CSA to promulgate rules with the\nforce of law.Ibid.; seeid.,at 281 (Scalia, J.,\ndissenting). Nevertheless, the Court explained, \u201cChevrondeference .\u00a0.\u00a0. is not accorded merely because the\nstatute is ambiguous and an administrative official is involved.\u201dId.,at 258. The regulation advancing the interpretation, we\nsaid, \u201cmust be promulgated pursuant to authority Congress has\ndelegated to the official.\u201dIbid.(citingMead,supra,at 226\u2013227).In the CSA, Congress delegated to the Attorney\nGeneral the authority to promulgate regulations \u201crelating to the\nregistration and control of the manufacture, distribution, and\ndispensing of controlled substances,\u201d 21 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7821,\nor \u201cfor the efficient execution of his functions under [the CSA],\u201d\n\u00a7871(b). After considering the text, structure, and purpose of the\nAct, the Court concludedon its ownthat interpreting\n\u201clegitimate medical purpose\u201d fell under neither delegation.Gonzales,546 U.\u00a0S., at 258\u2013269. Because the regulation\n\u201cwas not promulgated pursuant to the Attorney General\u2019s authority,\nits interpretation of \u2018legitimate medical purpose\u2019 d[id] not\nreceiveChevrondeference.\u201dId.,at 268.Adams Fruit,Mead, andGonzalesthus confirm thatChevrondeference is based\non, and finds legitimacy as, a congressional delegation of\ninterpretive authority. An agency interpretation warrants such\ndeference only if Congress has delegated authority to definitively\ninterpret a particular ambiguity in a particular manner. Whether\nCongress has done so must be determined by the court on its own\nbeforeChevroncan apply. See H. Edwards, L. Elliot, &\nM. Levy, Federal Courts Standards of Review 168 (2d ed. 2013) (\u201ca\ncourt decidesde\u00a0novowhether an agency has acted\nwithin the bounds of congressionally delegated authority\u201d (citingMead,supra,at 226\u2013227, andGonzales,supra,at 258)); Sales & Adler, The Rest is Silence:ChevronDeference, Agency Jurisdiction, and Statutory\nSilences,2009 U. Ill. L.\u00a0Rev. 1497, 1564 (2009) (\u201cif\ndelegation really is antecedent to deference, asMeadinsists, it cannot be that courts should defer to an agency\u2019s views\non whether a delegation has taken place\u201d).In other words, we do not defer to an agency\u2019s\ninterpretation of an ambiguous provision unless Congress wants us\nto, and whether Congress wants us to is a question that courts, not\nagencies, must decide. Simply put, that question is \u201cbeyond theChevronpale.\u201dMead,supra, at 234.IVDespite these precedents, the FCC argues that\na court need only locate an agency and a grant of general\nrulemaking authority over a statute.Chevrondeference then\napplies, it contends, to the agency\u2019s interpretation of any\nambiguity in the Act, including ambiguity in a provision said to\ncarve out specific provisions from the agency\u2019s general rulemaking\nauthority. If Congress intends to exempt part of the statute from\nthe agency\u2019s interpretive authority, the FCC says, Congress \u201ccan\nordinarily be expected to state that intent explicitly.\u201d Brief for\nFederal Respondents 30 (citingAmerican Hospital Assn.v.NLRB,499 U.S.\n606(1991)).If a congressional delegation of interpretive\nauthority is to supportChevrondeference, however, that\ndelegation must extend to the specific statutory ambiguity at\nissue. The appropriate question is whether the delegation covers\nthe \u201cspecific provision\u201d and \u201cparticular question\u201d before the\ncourt.Chevron, 467 U.\u00a0S., at 844. A congressional\ngrant of authority over some portion of a statute does not\nnecessarily mean that Congress granted the agency interpretive\nauthority over all its provisions. SeeAdams Fruit, 494\nU.\u00a0S., at 650.An example that might highlight the point\nconcerns statutes that parcel out authority to multiple agencies,\nwhich \u201cmay be the norm, rather than an exception.\u201d Gersen,\nOverlapping and Underlapping Jurisdiction in Administrative Law,\n2006 S. Ct. Rev. 201, 208; see,e.g., Gonzales, 546\nU.\u00a0S, at 250\u2013251 (describing shared author-ity over the CSA\nbetween the Attorney General and the Secretary of Health and Human\nServices);Suttonv.United Air Lines, Inc.,527 U.S.\n471, 478 (1999) (authority to issue regulations implementing\nthe Americans with Disabilities Act \u201cis split primarily among three\nGovernment agencies\u201d). The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and\nConsumer Protection Act, for example, authorizes rulemaking by at\nleast eight different agencies. See Con-gressional Research\nService, C. Copeland, Rulemaking Requirements and Authorities in\nthe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act 7\n(2010). When presented with an agency\u2019s interpretation of such a\nstatute, a court cannot simply ask whether the statute is one that\nthe agency administers; the question is whether authority over the\nparticular ambiguity at issue has been delegated to the particular\nagency.By the same logic, even when Congress provides\ninterpretive authority to a single agency, a court must decide if\nthe ambiguity the agency has purported to interpret with the force\nof law is one to which the congressional delegation extends. A\ngeneral delegation to the agency to administer the statute will\noften suffice to satisfy the court that Congress has delegated\ninterpretive authority over the ambiguity at issue. But if Congress\nhas exempted particular provisions from that authority, that\nexemption must be respected, and the determination whether Congress\nhas done so is for the courts alone.The FCC\u2019s argument that Congress \u201ccan ordinarily\nbe expected to state that intent explicitly,\u201d Brief for Federal\nRespondents 30 (citingAmerican Hospital,supra),\ngoes to the merits of that determination, not to whether a court\nshould decide the questionde\u00a0novoor defer to the\nagency. Indeed, that is how the Court inAmericanHospitalconsidered it. It was in the process of \u201cemploying\nthe traditional tools of statutory construction\u201d that the Court\nsaid it would have expected Congress to speak more clearly if it\nhad intended to exclude an entire subject area\u2014employee units for\ncollecting bargaining\u2014from the NLRB\u2019s general rulemaking authority.Id.,at 613, 614. The Court concluded, after considering the\nlanguage, structure, policy, and legislative history of the Act on\nits own\u2014without deferring to the agency\u2014that the meaning of the\nstatute was \u201cclear and contrary to the meaning advanced by\npetitioner.\u201dId.,at 609\u2013614. To be sure, the Court also\nnoted that \u201c[e]ven if wecouldfind any ambiguity in [the\nprovision] after employing the traditional tools of statutory\nconstruction, we would still defer to Board\u2019s reasonable\ninterpretation.\u201dId.,at 614 (emphasis added). But that\nsingle sentence of dictum cannot carry the day for the FCC\nhere.VAs the preceding analysis makes clear, I do\nnot understand petitioners to ask the Court\u2014nor do I think it\nnecessary\u2014to draw a \u201cspecious, but scary-sounding\u201d line between\n\u201cbig, important\u201d interpretations on the one hand and \u201chumdrum,\nrun-of-the-mill\u201d ones on the other.Ante,at 5, 12. Drawing\nsuch a line may well be difficult. Distinguishing between whether\nan agency\u2019s interpretation of an ambiguous term is reasonable and\nwhether that term is for the agency to interpret is not nearly so\ndifficult. It certainly did not confuse the FCC in this proceeding.\nCompareIn\u00a0re Petition for Declaratory Ruling, 24 FCC\nRcd. 13994, 14000\u201314003 (2009) (addressing the latter question),\nwithid.,at 14003\u201314015 (addressing the former). Nor did it\nconfound the Fifth Circuit. Compare 668 F.\u00a03d, at 247\u2013254\n(deciding \u201cwhether the FCC possessed statutory authority to\nadminister \u00a7332(c)(7)(B)(ii)\u201d), withid.,at 254\u2013260\n(considering \u201cwhether the 90- and 150-day time frames themselves\nalso pass muster underChevron\u201d). More importantly, if the\nlegitimacy ofChevrondeference is based on a congressional\ndelegation of interpretive authority, then the line is one the\nCourt must draw.The majority\u2019s hypothetical Common Carrier Acts\ndo not demonstrate anything different.Ante,at 6\u20138. The\nmajor-ity states that in its second Common Carrier Act, Section 2\nmakes clear that Congress \u201c\u00a0\u2018conferred interpretative power on\nthe agency\u2019\u00a0\u201d to interpret the ambiguous terms \u201ccommon\ncarrier\u201d and \u201cunreasonable condition.\u201dAnte,at 7 (quoting\nBrief for Petitioners in No. 1545, p.\u00a014). Thus, it says,\nunder anyone\u2019s theory a court must defer to the agency\u2019s reasonable\ninterpretations of those terms. Correct.The majority claims, however, that \u201cpetitioners\u2019\ntheory would accord the agency no deference\u201d in its interpretation\nof the same ambiguous terms in the first Common Carrier Act.Ante,at 7\u20138. But as I understand petitioners\u2019 argument\u2014and\ncertainly in my own view\u2014a court, in both cases, need only decide\nfor itself whether Congress has delegated to the agency authority\nto interpret the ambiguous terms, before affording the agency\u2019s\ninterpretationChevrondeference.For the second Common Carrier Act, the answer is\neasy. The majority\u2019s hypothetical Congress has spoken clearly and\nspecifically in Section 2 of the Act about its delegation of\nauthority to interpret Section 1. As for the first Act, it is\nharder to analyze the question, given only one section of a\npresumably much larger statute. But if the first Common Carrier Act\nis like most agencies\u2019 organic statutes, I have no reason to doubt\nthat the agency would likewise have interpretive authority over the\nsame ambiguous terms, and therefore be entitled to deference in\ncon-struing them, just as with the second Common Carrier Act. There\nis no new \u201ctest\u201d to worry about, cf.ante,at 16; courts\nwould simply apply the normal rules of statutory construction.That the question might be harder with respect\nto the first Common Carrier Act should come as no surprise. The\nsecond hypothetical Congress has more carefully defined the\nagency\u2019s authority than the first.Whateverstandard of\nreview applies, it is more difficult to interpret an unclear\nstatute than a clear one. My point is simply that before a court\ncan defer to the agency\u2019s interpretation of the ambiguous terms in\neither Act, it must determine for itself that Congress has\ndelegated authority to the agency to issue those interpretations\nwith the force of law.The majority also expresses concern that\nadopting petitioners\u2019 position would undermineChevron\u2019s\nstable background rule against which Congress legislates.Ante,at 5. That, of course, begs the question of what that\nstable background rule is. See Merrill & Hickman,Chevron\u2019s Domain, 89 Geo. L.\u00a0Rev. 833, 910 (2001)\n(\u201cCourts have never deferred to agencies with respect to questions\nsuch as whether Congress has delegated to an agency the power to\nact with the force of law through either legislative rules or\nbinding adjudications. Similarly, it has never been maintained that\nCongress would want courts to giveChevrondeference to an\nagency\u2019s determination that it is entitled toChevrondeference, or should giveChevrondeference to an agency\u2019s\ndetermination of what types of interpretations are entitled toChevrondeference\u201d (footnote omitted)).VIThe Court sees something nefarious behind the\nview that courts must decide on their own whether Congress has\ndelegated interpretative authority to an agency, before deferring\nto that agency\u2019s interpretation of law. What is afoot, according to\nthe Court, is a judicial power-grab, with nothing less than\n\u201cChevronitself\u201d as \u201cthe ultimate target.\u201dAnte,at\n12.The Court touches on a legitimate concern:Chevronimportantly guards against the Judiciary arrogating\nto itself policymaking properly left, under the separation of\npowers, to the Executive. But there is another concern at play, no\nless firmly rooted in our constitutional structure. That is the\nobligation of the Judiciary not only to confine itself to its\nproper role, but to ensure that the other branches do so as\nwell.An agency\u2019s interpretive authority, entitling\nthe agency to judicial deference, acquires its legitimacy from a\ndelegation of lawmaking power from Congress to the Executive. Our\nduty to police the boundary between the Legislature and the\nExecutive is as critical as our duty to respect that between the\nJudiciary and the Executive. SeeZivotofskyv.Clinton, 566 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 8). In\nthe present context, that means ensuring that the Legislative\nBranch has in fact delegated lawmaking power to an agency within\nthe Executive Branch, before the Judiciary defers to the Executive\non what the law is. That concern is heightened, not diminished, by\nthe fact that the administrative agencies, as a practical matter,\ndraw upon a potent brew of executive, legislative, and judicial\npower. And it is heightened, not diminished, by the dramatic shift\nin power over the last 50 years from Congress to the Executive\u2014a\nshift effected through the administrative agencies.We reconcile our competing responsibilities in\nthis area by ensuring judicial deference to agency interpretations\nunderChevron\u2014but only after we have determined on our own\nthat Congress has given interpretive authority to the agency. Our\n\u201ctask is to fix the boundaries of delegated authority,\u201d Monaghan,\n83 Colum. L.\u00a0Rev., at 27; that is not a task we can delegate\nto the agency. We do not leave it to the agency to decide when it\nis in charge.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*In these cases, the FCC issued a declaratory\nruling interpreting the term \u201creasonable period of time\u201d in 47\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7332(c)(7)(B)(ii). The Fifth Circuit correctly\nrecognized that it could not applyChevrondeference to the\nFCC\u2019s interpretation unless the agency \u201cpossessed statutory\nauthority to administer \u00a7332(c)(7)(B)(ii),\u201d but it erred by\ngrantingChevrondeference to the FCC\u2019s view on that\nantecedent question. See 668 F.\u00a03d, at 248. Because the court\nshould have determined on its own whether Congress delegated\ninterpretive authority over \u00a7332(c)(7)(B)(ii) to the FCC before\naffordingChevrondeference, I would vacate the decision\nbelow and remand the cases to the Fifth Circuit to perform the\nproper inquiry in the first instance.I respectfully dissent.",
