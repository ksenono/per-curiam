C.,\net\u00a0al., PETITIONERS18\u20131323v.STEPHEN RUSSO, INTERIM SECRETARY,\nLOUISIANA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HOSPITALSSTEPHEN RUSSO, INTERIM SECRETARY,\nLOUISIANA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HOSPITALS, PETITIONER18\u20131460v.JUNE MEDICAL SERVICES L. L. C.,\net\u00a0al.on writs of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the fifth circuit[June 29, 2020]Chief Justice Roberts, concurring in the\njudgment.In July 2013, Texas enacted a law requiring a\nphysician performing an abortion to have \u201cactive admitting\nprivileges at a hospital .\u00a0.\u00a0. located not further than\n30 miles from the location at which the abortion is performed.\u201d\nTex. Health & Safety Code Ann. \u00a7171.0031(a)(1)(A) (West Cum.\nSupp. 2019). The law caused the number of facilities providing\nabortions to drop in half. InWhole Woman\u2019s Healthv.Hellerstedt, 579 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2016), the Court concluded\nthat Texas\u2019s admitting privileges requirement \u201cplaces a substantial\nobstacle in the path of women seeking a previability abortion\u201d and\ntherefore violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment.Id.,at ___ (slip op., at 2) (citingPlanned\nParenthood of Southeastern Pa.v.Casey,505 U.S.\n833, 878 (1992) (plurality opinion)).I joined the dissent inWhole Woman\u2019s\nHealthand continue to believe that the case was wrongly\ndecided. The question today however is not whetherWhole Woman\u2019s\nHealthwas right or wrong, but whether to adhere to it in\ndeciding the present case. SeeMoorev.Texas, 586\nU.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2019) (Roberts, C.\u00a0J., concurring) (slip\nop., at 1).Today\u2019s case is a challenge from several\nabortion clinics and providers to a Louisiana law nearly identical\nto the Texas law struck down four years ago inWhole Woman\u2019s\nHealth. Just like the Texas law, the Louisiana law requires\nphysicians performing abortions to have \u201cactive admitting\nprivileges at a hospital .\u00a0.\u00a0. located not further than\nthirty miles from the location at which the abortion is performed.\u201d\nLa. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a740:1061.10(A)(2)(a) (West Cum. Supp. 2020).\nFollowing a six-day bench trial, the District Court found that\nLouisiana\u2019s law would \u201cresult in a drastic reduction in the number\nand geographic distribution of abortion providers.\u201dJune Medical\nServices LLCv.Kliebert, 250 F.\u00a0Supp.\u00a03d 27,\n87 (MD La. 2017). The law would reduce the number of clinics from\nthree to \u201cone, or at most two,\u201d and the number of physicians\nproviding abortions from five to \u201cone, or at most two,\u201d and\n\u201ctherefore cripple women\u2019s ability to have an abortion in\nLouisiana.\u201dId.,at 87\u201388.The legal doctrine ofstare decisisrequires us, absent special circumstances, to treat like cases\nalike. The Louisiana law imposes a burden on access to abortion\njust as severe as that imposed by the Texas law, for the same\nreasons. Therefore Louisiana\u2019s law cannot stand under our\nprecedents.IStare decisis(\u201cto stand by things\ndecided\u201d) is the legal term for fidelity to precedent. Black\u2019s Law\nDictionary 1696 (11th ed. 2019). It has long been \u201can established\nrule to abide by former precedents, where the same points come\nagain in litigation; as well to keep the scale of justice even and\nsteady, and not liable to waver with every new judge\u2019s opinion.\u201d 1\nW. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 69 (1765). This\nprinciple is grounded in a basic humility that recognizes today\u2019s\nlegal issues are often not so different from the questions of\nyesterday and that we are not the first ones to try to answer them.\nBecause the \u201cprivate stock of reason .\u00a0.\u00a0. in each man is\nsmall, .\u00a0.\u00a0. individuals would do better to avail\nthemselves of the general bank and capital of nations and of ages.\u201d\n3 E. Burke, Reflections on the Revolution in France 110 (1790).Adherence to precedent is necessary to \u201cavoid an\narbitrary discretion in the courts.\u201d The Federalist No. 78, p. 529\n(J. Cooke ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton). The constraint of precedent\ndistinguishes the judicial \u201cmethod and philosophy from those of the\npolitical and legislative process.\u201d Jackson, Decisional Law and\nStare Decisis, 30 A.\u00a0B.\u00a0A.\u00a0J. 334 (1944).The doctrine also brings pragmatic benefits.\nRespect for precedent \u201cpromotes the evenhanded, predictable, and\nconsistent development of legal principles, fosters reliance on\njudicial decisions, and contributes to the actual and perceived\nintegrity of the judicial process.\u201dPaynev.Tennessee,501 U.S.\n808, 827 (1991). It is the \u201cmeans by which we ensure that the\nlaw will not merely change erratically, but will develop in a\nprincipled and intelligible fashion.\u201dVasquezv.Hillery,474 U.S.\n254, 265 (1986). In that way, \u201cstare decisisis an old\nfriend of the common lawyer.\u201d Jackson,supra,at 334.Stare decisisis not an \u201cinexorable\ncommand.\u201dRamosv.Louisiana, 590 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___\n(2020) (slip op., at 20) (internal quotation marks omitted). But\nfor precedent to mean anything, the doctrine must give way only to\na rationale that goes beyond whether the case was decided\ncorrectly. The Court accordingly considers additional factors\nbefore overruling a precedent, such as its adminstrability, its fit\nwith subsequent factual and legal developments, and the reliance\ninterests that the precedent has engendered. SeeJanusv.State, County, and Municipal Employees,585 U.\u00a0S. ___,\n____\u2013____ (2018) (slip op., at 34\u201335).Stare decisisprinciples also determine\nhow we handle a decision that itself departed from the cases that\ncame before it. In those instances, \u201c[r]emaining true to an\n\u2018intrinsically sounder\u2019 doctrine established in prior cases better\nserves the values ofstare decisisthan would following\u201d the\nrecent departure.Adarand Constructors, Inc.v.Pe\u00f1a,515 U.S.\n200, 231 (1995) (plurality opinion).Stare decisisis\npragmatic and contextual, not \u201ca mechanical formula of adherence to\nthe latest decision.\u201dHelveringv.Hallock,309 U.S.\n106, 119 (1940).IIABoth Louisiana and the providers agree that\nthe undue burden standard announced inCaseyprovides the\nappropriate framework to analyze Louisiana\u2019s law. Brief for\nPetitioners in No. 18\u20131323, pp. 45\u201347; Brief for Respondent in No.\n18\u20131323, pp. 60\u201362. Neither party has asked us to reassess the\nconstitutional validity of that standard.Caseyreaffirmed \u201cthe most central\nprinciple ofRoev.Wade,\u201d \u201ca woman\u2019s right to\nterminate her pregnancy before viability.\u201dCasey, 505\nU.\u00a0S., at 871 (plurality opinion).[1] At the same time, it recognized that the State has\n\u201cimportant and legitimate interests in .\u00a0.\u00a0. protecting\nthe health of the pregnant woman and in protecting the potentiality\nof human life.\u201dId.,at 875\u2013876 (internal quotation marks\nand brackets omitted).To serve the former interest, the State may,\n\u201c[a]s with any medical procedure,\u201d enact \u201cregulations to further\nthe health or safety of a woman seeking an abortion.\u201dId.,at 878. To serve the latter interest, the State may, among other\nthings, \u201cenact rules and regulations designed to encourage her to\nknow that there are philosophic and social arguments of great\nweight that can be brought to bear in favor of continuing the\npregnancy to full term.\u201dId.,at 872. The State\u2019s freedom to\nenact such rules is \u201cconsistent withRoe\u2019s central premises,\nand indeed the inevitable consequence of our holding that the State\nhas an interest in protecting the life of the unborn.\u201dId.,at 873.UnderCasey, the State may not impose an\nundue burden on the woman\u2019s ability to obtain an abortion. \u201cA\nfinding of an undue burden is a shorthand for the conclusion that a\nstate regulation has the purpose or effect of placing a substantial\nobstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion of a nonviable\nfetus.\u201dId.,at 877. Laws that do not pose a substantial\nobstacle to abortion access are permissible, so long as they are\n\u201creasonably related\u201d to a legitimate state interest.Id.,at\n878.After faithfully reciting this standard, the\nCourt inWhole Woman\u2019s Healthadded the following\nobservation: \u201cThe rule announced inCasey.\u00a0.\u00a0.\nrequires that courts consider the burdens a law imposes on abortion\naccess together with the benefits those laws confer.\u201d 579\nU.\u00a0S., at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 19\u201320). The plurality repeats\ntoday that the undue burden standard requires courts \u201cto weigh the\nlaw\u2019s asserted benefits against the burdens it imposes on abortion\naccess.\u201dAnte,at 2 (internal quotation marks omitted).Read in isolation fromCasey, such an\ninquiry could invite a grand \u201cbalancing test in which unweighted\nfactors mysteriously are weighed.\u201dMarrsv.Motorola,\nInc., 577 F.3d 783, 788 (CA7 2009). Under such tests, \u201cequality\nof treatment is .\u00a0.\u00a0. impossible to achieve;\npredictability is destroyed; judicial arbitrariness is facilitated;\njudicial courage is impaired.\u201d Scalia, The Rule of Law as a Law of\nRules, 56 U. Chi. L.\u00a0Rev. 1175, 1182 (1989).In this context, courts applying a balancing\ntest would be asked in essence to weigh the State\u2019s interests in\n\u201cprotecting the potentiality of human life\u201d and the health of the\nwoman, on the one hand, against the woman\u2019s liberty interest in\ndefining her \u201cown concept of existence, of meaning, of the\nuniverse, and of the mystery of human life\u201d on the other.Casey, 505 U.\u00a0S., at 851 (opinion of the Court);id.,at 871 (plurality opinion) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). There is no plausible sense in which anyone, let alone\nthis Court, could objectively assign weight to such imponderable\nvalues and no meaningful way to compare them if there were.\nAttempting to do so would be like \u201cjudging whether a particular\nline is longer than a particular rock is heavy,\u201dBendix Autolite\nCorp.v.Midwesco Enterprises, Inc.,486 U.S.\n888, 897 (1988) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment).\nPretending that we could pull that off would require us to act as\nlegislators, not judges, and would result in nothing other than an\n\u201cunanalyzed exercise of judicial will\u201d in the guise of a \u201cneutral\nutilitarian calculus.\u201dNew Jerseyv.T.\u00a0L.\u00a0O.,469 U.S.\n325, 369 (1985) (Brennan, J., concurring in part and dissenting\nin part).Nothing aboutCaseysuggested that a\nweighing of costs and benefits of an abortion regulation was a job\nfor the courts. On the contrary, we have explained that the\n\u201ctraditional rule\u201d that \u201cstate and federal legislatures [have] wide\ndiscretion to pass legislation in areas where there is medical and\nscientific uncertainty\u201d is \u201cconsistent withCasey.\u201dGonzalesv.Carhart,550 U.S.\n124, 163 (2007).Caseyinstead focuses on the existence\nof a substantial obstacle, the sort of inquiry familiar to judges\nacross a variety of contexts. See,e.g.,Burwellv.Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc.,573 U.S.\n682, 694\u2013695 (2014) (asking whether the government\n\u201csubstantially burdens a person\u2019s exercise of religion\u201d under the\nReligious Freedom Restoration Act);Arizona Free Enterprise\nClub\u2019s Freedom Club PACv.Bennett,564 U.S.\n721, 748 (2011) (asking whether a law \u201cimposes a substantial\nburden on the speech of privately financed candidates and\nindependent expenditure groups\u201d);Murphyv.United Parcel\nService, Inc.,527 U.S.\n516, 521 (1999) (asking, in the context of the Americans with\nDisabilities Act, whether an individual\u2019s impairment \u201csubstantially\nlimits one or more major life activities\u201d (internal quotation marks\nomitted)).Casey\u2019s analysis of the various\nrestrictions that were at issue in that case is illustrative. For\nexample, the opinion recognized that Pennsylvania\u2019s 24-hour waiting\nperiod for abortions \u201chas the effect of increasing the cost and\nrisk of delay of abortions,\u201d but observed that the District Court\ndid not find that the \u201cincreased costs and potential delays amount\nto substantial obstacles.\u201d 505 U.\u00a0S., at 886 (joint opinion of\nO\u2019Connor, Kennedy, and Souter, JJ.) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). The opinion concluded that \u201cgiven the statute\u2019s\ndefinition of medical emergency,\u201d the waiting period did not\n\u201cimpose[\u00a0] a real health risk.\u201dIbid.Because the law\ndid not impose a substantial obstacle,Caseyupheld it. And\nit did so notwithstanding the District Court\u2019s finding that the law\ndid \u201cnot further the state interest in maternal health.\u201dIbid.(internal quotation marks omitted).Turning to the State\u2019s various recordkeeping and\nreporting requirements,Caseyfound those requirements do\nnot \u201cimpose a substantial obstacle to a woman\u2019s choice\u201d because\n\u201c[a]t most they increase the cost of some abortions by a slight\namount.\u201dId.,at 901. \u201cWhile at some point increased cost\ncould become a substantial obstacle,\u201d there was \u201cno such showing on\nthe record\u201d before the Court.Ibid.The Court did not weigh\nthis cost against the benefits of the law.The same was true for Pennsylvania\u2019s parental\nconsent requirement.Caseyheld that \u201ca State may require a\nminor seeking an abortion to obtain the consent of a parent or\nguardian, provided there is an adequate judicial bypass procedure.\u201dId.,at 899 (citing, among other cases,Ohiov.Akron Center for Reproductive Health,497 U.S.\n502, 510\u2013519 (1990)).Caseyrelied on precedent\nestablishing that judicial bypass procedures \u201cprevent another\nperson from having an absolute veto power over a minor\u2019s decision\nto have an abortion.\u201dAkron, 497 U.\u00a0S., at 510. Without\na judicial bypass, parental consent laws impose a substantial\nobstacle to a minor\u2019s ability to obtain an abortion and therefore\nconstitute an undue burden. SeeCasey, 505 U.\u00a0S., at\n899 (joint opinion).The opinion similarly looked to whether there\nwas a substantial burden, not whether benefits outweighed burdens,\nin analyzing Pennsylvania\u2019s requirement that physicians provide\ncertain \u201ctruthful, nonmisleading information\u201d about the nature of\nthe abortion procedure.Id., at 882. The opinion concluded\nthat the requirement \u201ccannot be considered a substantial obstacle\nto obtaining an abortion, and,it follows, there is no undue\nburden.\u201dId., at 883 (emphasis added).With regard to the State\u2019s requirement that a\nphysician, as opposed to a qualified assistant, provide the woman\nthis information, the opinion reasoned: \u201cSincethere is no\nevidence on this record that requiring a doctor to give the\ninformation as provided by the statute would amount in practical\nterms to a substantial obstacle to a woman seeking an abortion, we\nconclude that it is not an undue burden.\u201dId.,at 884\u2013885\n(emphasis added). This was so \u201ceven if an objective assessment\nmight suggest that those same tasks could be performed by others,\u201d\nmeaning the law had little if any benefit.Id.,at 885.The only restrictionCaseyfound\nunconstitutional was Pennsylvania\u2019s spousal notification\nrequirement. On that score, the Court recited a bevy of social\nscience evidence demonstrating that \u201cmillions of women in this\ncountry .\u00a0.\u00a0. may have justifiable fears of physical\nabuse\u201d or \u201cdevastating forms of psychological abuse from their\nhusbands.\u201dId.,at 893 (opinion of the Court). In addition\nto \u201cphysical violence\u201d and \u201cchild abuse,\u201d women justifiably feared\n\u201cverbal harassment, threats of future violence, the destruction of\npossessions, physical confinement to the home, the withdrawal of\nfinancial support, or the disclosure of the abortion to family and\nfriends.\u201dIbid.The spousal notification requirement was\n\u201cthus likely to prevent a significant number of women from\nobtaining an abortion.\u201dIbid.It did not \u201cmerely make\nabortions a little more difficult or expensive to obtain; for many\nwomen, it [imposed] a substantial obstacle.\u201dId.,at\n893\u2013894. The Court emphasized that it would not \u201cblind [itself] to\nthe fact that the significant number of women who fear for their\nsafety and the safety of their children are likely to be deterred\nfrom procuring an abortion as surely as if the Commonwealth had\noutlawed abortion in all cases.\u201dId.,at 894.The upshot ofCaseyis clear: The several\nrestrictions that did not impose a substantial obstacle were\nconstitutional, while the restriction that did impose a substantial\nobstacle was unconstitutional.To be sure, the Court at times discussed the\nbenefits of the regulations, including when it distinguished\nspousal notification from parental consent. SeeWhole Woman\u2019s\nHealth, 579 U.\u00a0S., at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 19\u201320) (citingCasey, 505 U.\u00a0S., at 887\u2013898 (opinion of the Court);id.,at 899\u2013901 (joint opinion). But in the context ofCasey\u2019s governing standard, these benefits were not placed\non a scale opposite the law\u2019s burdens. Rather,Caseydiscussed benefits in considering the threshold requirement that\nthe State have a \u201clegitimate purpose\u201d and that the law be\n\u201creasonably related to that goal.\u201dId., at 878 (plurality\nopinion);id.,at 882 (joint opinion).So long as that showing is made, the only\nquestion for a court is whether a law has the \u201ceffect of placing a\nsubstantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion of\na nonviable fetus.\u201dId., at 877 (plurality opinion).Caseyrepeats that \u201csubstantial obstacle\u201d standard nearly\nverbatim no less than 15 times.Id.,at 846, 894, 895\n(opinion of the Court);id.,at 877, 878 (plurality\nopinion);id.,at 883, 884, 885, 886, 887, 901 (joint\nopinion).[2]The only place a balancing test appears inCaseyis in Justice Stevens\u2019s partial dissent. \u201cWeighing the\nState\u2019s interest in potential life and the woman\u2019s liberty\ninterest,\u201d Justice Stevens would have gone further than the\nplurality to strike down portions of the State\u2019s informed consent\nrequirements and 24-hour waiting period.Id.,at 916\u2013920\n(opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part). But that\napproach did not win the day.Mazurekv.Armstrongplaces this\nunderstanding ofCasey\u2019s undue burden standard beyond doubt.Mazurekinvolved a challenge to a Montana law restricting\nthe performance of abortions to licensed physicians. 520\nU.\u00a0S.,at 969. It was \u201cuncontested that there was\ninsufficient evidence of a \u2018substantial obstacle\u2019 to abortion.\u201dId.,at 972. Therefore, once the Court found that the\nMontana Legislature had not acted with an \u201cunlawful motive,\u201d the\nCourt\u2019s work was complete.Ibid. In fact, the Court found\nthe challengers\u2019 argument\u2014that the law was invalid because \u201call\nhealth evidence contradicts the [State\u2019s] claim that there is any\nhealth basis for the law\u201d\u2014to be \u201csquarely foreclosedbyCaseyitself.\u201dId.,at 973 (internal quotation marks\nomitted; emphasis added).We should respect the statement inWhole\nWoman\u2019s Healththat it was applying the undue burden standard\nofCasey. The opinion inWhole Woman\u2019s Healthbegan\nby saying, \u201cWe must here decide whether two provisions of [the\nTexas law] violate the Federal Constitution as interpreted inCasey.\u201d 579 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 1). Nothing\nmore. The Court explicitly stated that it was applying \u201cthe\nstandard, as described inCasey,\u201d and reversed the Court of\nAppeals for applying an approach that did \u201cnot match the standard\nthat this Court laid out inCasey.\u201dId.,at ___, ___\n(slip op., at 19, 20).Here the plurality expressly acknowledges that\nwe are not considering how to analyze an abortion regulation that\ndoes not present a substantial obstacle. \u201cThat,\u201d the plurality\nexplains, \u201cis not this case.\u201dAnte, at 40. In this case,Casey\u2019s requirement of finding a substantial obstacle before\ninvalidating an abortion regulation is therefore a sufficient basis\nfor the decision, as it was inWhole Woman\u2019s Health. In\nneither case, nor inCaseyitself, was there call for\nconsideration of a regulation\u2019s benefits, and nothing inCaseycommands such consideration. Under principles ofstare decisis, I agree with the plurality that the\ndetermination inWhole Woman\u2019s Healththat Texas\u2019s law\nimposed a substantial obstacle requires the same determination\nabout Louisiana\u2019s law. Under those same principles, I would adhere\nto the holding ofCasey, requiring a substantial obstacle\nbefore striking down an abortion regulation.BWhole Woman\u2019s Healthheld that Texas\u2019s\nadmitting privileges requirement placed \u201ca substantial obstacle in\nthe path of women seeking a previability abortion,\u201d independent of\nits discussion of benefits. 579 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 2)\n(citingCasey, 505 U.\u00a0S., at 878 (plurality\nopinion)).[3] Because\nLouisiana\u2019s admitting privileges requirement would restrict women\u2019s\naccess to abortion to the same degree as Texas\u2019s law, it also\ncannot stand under our precedent.[4]To begin, the two laws are nearly identical.\nPrior to enactment of the Texas law, abortion providers were\nrequired either to possess local hospital admitting privileges or\nto have a transfer agreement with a physician who had such\nprivileges. Tex. Admin. Code, tit. 25, \u00a7139.56(a) (2009). The new\nlaw, adopted in 2013, eliminated the option of having a transfer\nagreement. Providers were required to \u201c[h]ave active admitting\nprivileges at a hospital .\u00a0.\u00a0. located not further than\n30 miles from the location at which the abortion is performed.\u201d\nTex. Health & Safety Code Ann. \u00a7171.0031(a)(1)(A).Likewise, Louisiana law previously required\nabortion providers to have either admitting privileges or a\ntransfer agreement. La. Admin. Code, tit. 48, pt. I, \u00a74407(A)(3)\n(2003), 29 La. Reg. 706\u2013707 (2003). In 2014, Louisiana removed the\noption of having a transfer agreement. Just like Texas, Louisiana\nnow requires abortion providers to \u201c[h]ave active admitting\nprivileges at a hospital .\u00a0.\u00a0. located not further than\nthirty miles from the location at which the abortion is performed.\u201d\nLa. Rev. Stat. \u00a740:1061.10(A)(2)(a).Crucially, the District Court findings indicate\nthat Louisiana\u2019s law would restrict access to abortion in just the\nsame way as Texas\u2019s law, to the same degree or worse. In Texas, \u201cas\nof the time the admitting-privileges requirement began to be\nenforced, the number of facilities providing abortions dropped in\nhalf, from about 40 to about 20.\u201dWhole Woman\u2019s Health, 579\nU.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 24). Eight abortion clinics closed\nin the months prior to the law\u2019s effective date.Ibid.Another 11 clinics closed on the day the law took effect.Ibid.Similarly, the District Court found that the\nLouisiana law would \u201cresult in a drastic reduction in the number\nand geographic distribution of abortion providers.\u201d 250 F. Supp.\n3d, at 87. At the time of the District Court\u2019s decision, there were\nthree clinics and five physicians performing abortions in\nLouisiana.Id.,at 40, 41. The District Court found that the\nnew law would reduce \u201cthe number of clinics to one, or at most\ntwo,\u201d and the number of physicians in Louisiana to \u201cone, or at most\ntwo,\u201d as well.Id.,at 87. Even in the best case, \u201cthe\ndemand for services would vastly exceed the supply.\u201dIbid.Whole Woman\u2019s Healthfound that the\nclosures of the abortion clinics led to \u201cfewer doctors, longer\nwaiting times, and increased crowding.\u201d 579 U.\u00a0S., at ___\n(slip op., at 26). The Court also found that \u201cthe number of women\nof reproductive age living in a county more than 150 miles from a\nprovider increased from approximately 86,000 to 400,000 and the\nnumber of women living in a county more than 200 miles from a\nprovider from approximately 10,000 to 290,000.\u201dIbid.(internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).The District Court here likewise found that the\nLouisiana law would result in \u201clonger waiting times for\nappointments, increased crowding and increased associated health\nrisk.\u201d 250 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at 81. The court found that Louisiana\nwomen already \u201chave difficulty affording or arranging for\ntransportation and childcare on the days of their clinic visits\u201d\nand that \u201c[i]ncreased travel distance\u201d would exacerbate this\ndifficulty.Id.,at 83. The law would prove \u201cparticularly\nburdensome for women living in northern Louisiana .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nwho once could access a clinic in their own area [and] will now\nhave to travel approximately 320 miles to New Orleans.\u201dIbid.In Texas, \u201ccommon prerequisites to obtaining\nadmitting privileges that [had] nothing to do with ability to\nperform medical procedures,\u201d including \u201cclinical data requirements,\nresidency requirements, and other discretionary factors,\u201d made it\ndifficult for well-credentialed abortion physicians to obtain such\nprivileges.Whole Woman\u2019s Health, 579 U.\u00a0S., at ___\n(slip op., at 25). In particular, the Court found that \u201chospitals\noften condition[ed] admitting privileges on reaching a certain\nnumber of admissions per year.\u201dId.,at ___ (slip op., at\n24) (internal quotation marks omitted).But because\ncomplications requiring hospitalization are relatively rare,\nabortion providers were \u201cunlikely to have any patients to admit\u201d\nand thus were \u201cunable to maintain admitting privileges or obtain\nthose privileges for the future.\u201dId.,at ___ (slip op., at\n25).So too here. \u201cWhile a physician\u2019s competency is\na factor in assessing an applicant for admitting privileges\u201d in\nLouisiana, \u201cit is only one factor that hospitals consider in\nwhether to grant privileges.\u201d 250 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at 46.\nLouisiana hospitals \u201cmay deny privileges or decline to consider an\napplication for privileges for myriad reasons unrelated to\ncompetency,\u201d including \u201cthe physician\u2019s expected usage of the\nhospital and intent to admit and treat patients there, the number\nof patients the physician has treated in the hospital in the recent\npast, the needs of the hospital, the mission of the hospital, or\nthe business model of the hospital.\u201dIbid.[5]And the District Court found that, as in Texas,\nLouisiana \u201chospitals often grant admitting privileges to a\nphysician because the physician plans to provide services in the\nhospital\u201d and that \u201c[i]n general, hospital admitting privileges are\nnot provided to physicians who never intend to provide services in\na hospital.\u201dId.,at 49. But \u201c[b]ecause, by all accounts,\nabortion complications are rare, an abortion provider is unlikely\nto have a consistent need to admit patients.\u201dId.,at 50\n(citations omitted).[6]Importantly, the District Court found that\n\u201csince the passage of [the Louisiana law], all five remaining\ndoctors have attemptedin good faithto comply\u201d with the law\nby applying for admitting privileges, yet have had very little\nsuccess.Id., at 78 (emphasis added). This finding was\nnecessary to ensure that the physicians\u2019 inability to obtain\nadmitting privileges was attributable to the new law rather than a\nhalfhearted attempt to obtain privileges. Only then could the\nDistrict Court accurately identify the Louisiana law\u2019s burden on\nabortion access.The question is not whether we would reach the\nsame findings from the same record. These District Court findings\n\u201centail[ed] primarily .\u00a0.\u00a0. factual work\u201d and therefore\nare \u201creview[ed] only for clear error.\u201dU.\u00a0S. Bank\nN.\u00a0A.v.Village at Lakeridge,LLC, 583\nU.\u00a0S. ___, ___, ___ (2018) (slip op., at 6, 9). Clear error\nreview follows from a candid appraisal of the comparative\nadvantages of trial courts and appellate courts. \u201cWhile we review\ntranscripts for a living, they listen to witnesses for a living.\nWhile we largely read briefs for a living, they largely assess the\ncredibility of parties and witnesses for a living.\u201dTaglieriv.Monasky, 907 F.3d 404, 408 (CA6 2018) (en banc).We accordingly will not disturb the factual\nconclusions of the trial court unless we are \u201cleft with the\ndefinite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201dUnited Statesv.United States Gypsum Co.,333 U.S.\n364, 395 (1948). In my view, the District Court\u2019s work reveals\nno such clear error, for the reasons the plurality explains.Ante,at 19\u201335. The District Court findings therefore bind\nus in this case.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*Stare decisisinstructs us to treat\nlike cases alike. The result in this case is controlled by our\ndecision four years ago invalidating a nearly identical Texas law.\nThe Louisiana law burdens women seeking previability abortions to\nthe same extent as the Texas law, according to factual findings\nthat are not clearly erroneous. For that reason, I concur in the\njudgment of the Court that the Louisiana law is\nunconstitutional.Notes1Although parts ofCasey\u2019s joint opinion were a plurality not joined by a\nmajority of the Court, the joint opinion is nonetheless considered\nthe holding of the Court underMarksv.United\nStates,430 U.S.\n188, 193 (1977), as the narrowest position supporting the\njudgment.2Justice Gorsuch correctly\nnotes thatCasey\u201cexpressly disavowed any test as strict as\nstrict scrutiny.\u201dPost,at 20 (dissenting opinion). But he\ncertainly is wrong to suggest that my position is in any way\ninconsistent with that disavowal. Applying strict scrutiny would\nrequire \u201canyregulation touching upon the abortion decision\u201d\nto be the least restrictive means to further a compelling state\ninterest.Casey, 505 U.\u00a0S., at 871 (plurality opinion)\n(emphasis added).Caseyhowever recognized that such a test\nwould give \u201ctoo little acknowledgement and implementation\u201d to the\nState\u2019s \u201clegitimate interests in the health of the woman and in\nprotecting the potential life within her.\u201dIbid.UnderCasey, abortion regulations are valid so long as they do not\npose a substantial obstacle and meet the threshold requirement of\nbeing \u201creasonably related\u201d to a \u201clegitimate purpose.\u201dId.,\nat 878;id., at 882 (joint opinion).3Justice Gorsuch considers\nthis is a \u201cnonexistent ruling\u201d nowhere to be found inWhole\nWoman\u2019s Health.Post, at 19 (dissenting opinion). I\ndisagree.Whole Woman\u2019s Healthfirst surveyed the benefits\nof Texas\u2019s admitting privileges requirement. 579 U.\u00a0S., at\n___\u2013___ (slip op., at 23\u201324). The Court then transitioned to\nexamining the law\u2019s burdens: \u201cAt the same time, the record\nevidence indicates that the admitting-privileges requirement places\na substantial obstacle in the path of a woman\u2019s choice.\u201dId., at ___ (slip op., at 24) (internal quotation marks\nomitted; emphasis added). And the Court made clear that a law which\nhas the purpose or effect of placing \u201ca substantial obstacle in the\npath of a woman seeking an abortion before the fetus attains\nviability\u201d imposes an \u201cundue burden\u201d and therefore violates the\nConstitution.Id., at ___ (slip op., at 1) (internal\nquotation marks omitted; emphasis deleted). Thus the discussion of\nbenefits inWhole Woman\u2019s Healthwas not necessary to its\nholding.4For the reasons the\nplurality explains,ante,at 11\u201316, I agree that the\nabortion providers in this case have standing to assert the\nconstitutional rights of their patients.5Justice Alito\nmisunderstands my discussion of credentials as focusing on the\nlaw\u2019s lack of benefits. Seepost, at 4 (dissenting opinion).\nBut my analysis, likeCasey, is limited to the law\u2019s effect\non the availability of abortion.6I agree with Justice\nAlito that the validity of admitting privileges laws \u201cdepend[s] on\nnumerous factors that may differ from State to State.\u201dPost,\nat 9 (dissenting opinion). And I agree with Justice Gorsuch that\n\u201c[w]hen it comes to the factual record, litigants normally start\nthe case on a clean slate.\u201dPost,at 14 (dissenting\nopinion). Appreciating that others may in good faith disagree,\nhowever, I cannot view the record here as in any pertinent respect\nsufficiently different from that inWhole Woman\u2019s Healthto\nwarrant a different outcome.",
